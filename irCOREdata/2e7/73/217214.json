Why focus on growth and change?\nExplaining the growth and change of regions and cities is one of the great challenges for\nsocial science. Cities or regions, like any other geographical scale of the economic\nsystem, have complex economic development processes that are shaped by an almost\ninfinite range of forces. There is a thorny question as to what social science should aim\nto do in the face of such complexity.\nIn developing countries, regional and urban development is\u2014for obvious reasons\u2014\nseen as an integral part of the broad process of industrialization, with research focused\non the shaping of a city system, and the spatial dynamics of population and economic\nactivity that underpin the urban-industrial tradition (Black and Henderson, 1999). The\nframes of reference employed to think about such processes are mostly borrowed from\nthe \u2018long view backward\u2019, that is, to how the now-developed economies generated their\nurban systems at the time they developed (Fujita et al., 1999; Gabaix and Ioannides,\n2004). Such borrowing has the advantage of looking at the long-term, at dynamics and\nchange. But it necessarily must \u2018average\u2019 over many development experiences and hence\nmay err in its attribution of causes or in the relationship between universally-present\ncauses and nationally- or regionally-specific contexts. Along these lines, the\ncurrently-developed countries have widely-differing urban systems, in spite of their\nbroad convergence in many areas of economic structure and performance. Moreover,\neven in the developed countries that are used as templates for theorizing causes, urban\nJournal of Economic Geography 11 (2011) pp. 333\u2013346 doi:10.1093\/jeg\/lbq033\nAdvance Access Published on 7 December 2010\n\u0002 The Author (2010).

The past may therefore be only the most\nbasic of prologues for thinking about future dynamics, whether in developed or\ndeveloping countries.\nIt would be unrealistic to ask any field of theory and research\u2014 especially in an area\nof such complex human-technical interaction as the spatial economy\u2014to meet all these\nchallenges fully. But a focus on change and causality, by which I mean on studying\ncities and regions as forward-moving development processes\u2014should determine what is\nmost relevant in defining the ambitions of the field. Concretely, then, the field should be\nable to respond to such questions as: why do regions grow? Why do some decline? What\ndifferentiates regions that are able to sustain growth from those that are not? What are\nthe forces that cause per capita income to converge or diverge, and under what\nconditions do they operate? What are the principal regularities in urban and regional\ngrowth, and what are the events and processes that are not temporally- or\ngeographically-regular but that affect pathways of development in durable ways?\n2. The progress of the New Economic Geography and the New\nNeoclassical Urban Economics1\nTwo branches of spatial economics have developed in recent years. The New Economic\nGeography (NEG) emanates from the founding paper of Krugman (1991), whereas the\nNew Neoclassical Urban Economics (NNUE) evolves from the older traditions in urban\neconomics, offering an ambitious and inclusive set of inter-regional spatial equilibrium\nmodels. The two are substantially different from one another, but both have significant\ngaps in their ability to explain certain kinds of spatial-economic dynamics.\nThe NEG is principally concerned with production. The NEG sees spatial\nconcentration of economic activity as an endogenous part of the economic process,\nand hence not dependent on \u2018first nature geography\u2019 such as the uneven distribution of\nnatural resources, climate or proximity to coasts and rivers. Scale economies induce the\nconcentration of workers and firms, each enjoying closer contact with its markets and\naccess to a greater variety of inputs and products, if trade costs are even mildly positive\n(Krugman,1991; Fujita and Thisse, 2002). Moreover, trade costs are fully integrated\ninto this way of thinking, something which was not previously possible. Trade costs can\nalso have certain endogenous characteristics, because local interactions can generate\nfurther scale economies and increase the gap in trade costs between local and far away\neconomic agents (Martin and Ottaviano, 1999).\nThese are significant achievements, though most of the underlying insights have been\naround quite a long time. The generation of development economists typified by Albert\nHirschman, Gunnar Myrdal, Celso Furtado and Rau\u00b4l Prebisch, themselves drawing on\nseminal thinkers such as Wassily Leontief and Franc\u00b8ois Perroux, identified the circular\nand uneven developmental characteristics of the economy, through cumulative and\nself-reinforcing processes of agglomeration (Myrdal, 1957; Hirschman, 1958).\nMeanwhile, scholars of cities had long described Marshallian processes of economic\n1 I make the arguments in this section in greater detail in Storper (2010).\n334 . Storper\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nagglomeration as the basis of city economies (Pred, 1977; Hall, 1998). These earlier\nthinkers emphasized intermediate linkages, home market effects, and local learning, just\nas does the NEG today; but they did not did not place their insights in a framework\nwith a consistent view of trade costs, open economy relationships, labour mobility,\neconomies of scale and secure microfoundations. The NEG thus represents a\nfundamental leap forward.\nThe New Neoclassical Urban Economics (NNUE) takes a different approach, which\nis no less ambitious. It attempts to bring into a single framework the behaviours of\nfirms in choosing locations, of individuals and households in choosing residence, and of\ndevelopers in shaping the built environment. At its heart are how firms seek to raise\nproductivity and individuals to satisfy their preferences for income, paid amenities and\nnon-monetized amenities. Significantly, the NNUE introduces local politics over land\nand housing as a key sphere in which the possibilities of firms and individuals are\ndefined, unevenly from one place to another. Migration is made endogenous in this\ncomplex geographical force field. The NNUE also represents a sweeping conception of\nurban and regional dynamics.\nThe two are substantial rivals with one another. The NEG would explain the rise of\nSilicon Valley as the effect of a self-reinforcing process of agglomeration stemming from\nan initial accident; and it would explain high incomes there as the result of massive\neconomies of scale and variety, on one hand, and the skill composition of labour\ndemand in that agglomeration, on the other. The NNUE would say that workers seek\ninteraction and hence go to Silicon Valley; that firms cluster there to accede to such\nworkers and benefit from their productivity; and that households seek the amenities of\nthe San Francisco Bay Area, but that real incomes are not higher than in other regions\nbecause of the resulting high cost of housing, which is itself in part due to restrictions\nimposed by amenity-seeking skilled worker\/citizens, who limit land-housing develop-\nment. Thus, the NEG centres on economies of scale in production and consumption,\nand spatial development as a vast checkerboard of monopolistic competition; the\nNNUE makes very conventional assumptions about the structure of production and\nconsumption (that it is divisible), and focuses on optimal preference-satisfying\nbehaviour on the part of firms, workers, households and builders, in a\nperfect-competition world. In other words, the spatial sorting mechanisms for people\nand activity are radically different in the two theories.\n3. Limitations of the NEG and NNUE\nBoth the NEG and the NNUE have potentially important insights about certain aspects\nof the process of spatial-economic development; but both have substantial gaps in\nexplaining causality and change, and many assumptions of both are unrealistic because\nthey are driven by requirements of theoretical consistency rather than from what occurs\nin the real world.\nThe first major substantive limitation of the NNUE is that some of the assumptions\nemployed to explain change are highly improbable. Principal among them is the notion\nof \u2018spatial indifference\u2019. In this view, firms can substitute capital and labour to a\nsignificant degree as they choose among different possible locations. A firm can locate\nin a place with higher relative labour costs by substituting more capital, in the\nproportions dictated by its production function, but at the same time, it can opt for\nThe challenge for geography and economics . 335\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nalternative locations with lower relative labour prices by employing a higher proportion\nof labour. In other words, the firm (via its position along the production function)\nis considered to be a type of \u2018putty\u2019 that can be shaped by alternative locations\n(Glaeser, 2008). Linked closely to this indifference of the firm is that of the\nindividual-as-household or individual-as-worker: it is assumed that there are significant\nelasticities of money wages for such things as housing size or amenities such as climate\nand culture, and that these affect the choice of location between regions (and not just\nthe choice of neighbourhood within a region). People are considered to be \u2018putty\u2019 in the\nsame way that firms are.\nFirms certainly do choose locations according to the relative prices of factors at\ndifferent locations; but there is scant evidence that they can be truly indifferent among\nregions in the way required by this assumption. At any given moment, the demand for\ncapital and labour\u2014as it is distributed among different locations\u2014is driven first and\nforemost by the semi-fixed factor coefficients of the demanding firms. When there are\nstrongly-positive establishment-level scale economies (the standard NEG case) and\nrelatively low levels of inter-regional trade costs, firms \u2018go to\u2019 labour supplies, as in the\ncases of greenfield location or even offshoring at a global scale. When intermediate\ntrade costs to suppliers are high, or the need for high skills or for high levels of turnover\nof labour dominate the firm\u2019s choice, firms \u2018go to\u2019 other firms and to pools of labour.\nLabour-capital substitutions on the margin are minor, and firms are not \u2018indifferent\u2019. In\nthe short-run, then, the economy does not work like a simultaneous substitution system\nacross locations.\nThe NEG takes a different approach. Its big contribution is to place the phenomenon\nof localization or agglomeration at the centre of the geographical development process.\nIt does this by introducing scale economies, and allowing factors of production\n(especially labour) to be mobile, and then specifies the degree of unevenness of\ndevelopment that will emerge as determined by the interaction of these scale economies\nwith trade costs between firms and between firms and their markets. The NEG allows\nfor multiple agglomerations within the same industry, even with very low trade costs, by\nallowing for product variety\u2014a key realistic dimension of the modern economy. The\nNEG explains cross-hauling (intra-industry) trade among similarly-developed areas.\nGains to trade in NEG come not only from Ricardian specialization, but from the\ngeographically-differentiated productivity gains from agglomeration. The NEG has a\ndifferent view of factor proportions and prices from the NNUE. Nominal wages can\nvary due to establishment-level scale, or to the existence of clusters, both of which raise\nproductivity. So can the cost of living, where higher living costs are offset by access to\nconsumer variety, which becomes cheaper in bigger home markets for the NEG, and\nrepresents a pure \u2018taste\u2019 amenity in the NNUE. The economic equilibria that emerge\nfrom this kind of thinking usually involve high levels of unevenness of output and, in\nsome versions, of per capita income.\nIn the long-run, most NEG theorists continue to assume that interregional income\nconvergence will emerge as the result of declining trade costs, allowing greater sorting of\nproduction between regions that compete, and due to increasing labour mobility. But in\nthe NEG this is a much more temporally- and geographically-uneven process than in\nNNUE, because economies of scale\u2014within and between firms\u2014are a fundamental\ncharacteristic of the economy. Moreover, innovation and learning are admitted by some\nNEG theorists as potential sources of long-run productivity and factor price differences\nbetween places, even though they are very difficult to model. Because of this latter\n336 . Storper\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nfeature, they are never integrated fully into the \u2018big picture\u2019 NEG models (Duranton,\n2007; Fujita and Thisse, 2009). This leaves a strong difference between the NEG\u2019s\nsector-specific perspectives on spatial development, which push towards a vision of\nchange and differentiation, and its general models (Duranton and Puga, 2001;\nDuranton, 2007), which often propose mechanisms of long-term smoothing out of\ndevelopment, such as bell curves in the distribution of population and economic activity\n(Thisse, 2010; Rossi-Hansberg and Wright, 2007). The NEG also eschews attempting\nexplanation of the \u2018where\u2019 of agglomeration or the spatial income hierarchy (which\nplaces are on top or lower down), preferring to relegate these initial sources of\ndifference to \u2018accidents of history,\u2019 instead of asking whether there are any regularities\nor structural determinants of such origins.\nThe NNUE and NEG have additional differences in thinking about change and\ndevelopment. In the NEG, scale economies in production lead to higher productivity\nand wages in certain places; which, in turn lead to concentration of a variety of goods at\nlower prices (consumer amenities), which in turn lead to a win-win choice for\nindividuals of locating in places with high wages, low prices and high consumer variety.\nThe \u2018amenities\u2019 are thus endogenous to the process of spatial concentration, driven by\nscale and transport costs. This canonical core-periphery model is appealing because it\ndescribes the reality of high-income city-regions. But it does not explain why people and\nfirms would go to places with both lower wages and less variety of consumer goods or\nunpriced amenities. This is where the NNUE counters the core-periphery thinking of\nNEG by arguing that in some cases people will reduce their nominal wages in the\nperiphery in order to get its better unpriced amenities and cheaper housing, such that\nsorting over many different types of locations with different characteristics is achieved.\nThe NEG sees wages in the core regions as possibly incorporating a real wage boost\nfrom lower consumer prices (scale-supported variety and productivity), not a smooth,\narbitrage-and-substitution-driven version of spatial equilibrium.\nThe big picture is completed in NNUE approaches by adding the notion that other\nsectors of the economy respond to these dynamics, but also\u2014and this is crucial\u2014shape\nthem. The most important such sector is housing. Housing stocks respond to demand,\nwhich in turn depends on whatever is said to determine population growth (workers to\njobs? Or jobs to workers?). This, however, can be shaped by political forces, such as\nland use regulation\u2014involving sometimes an insider\/outsider conflict of interest\nbetween those already in a place and those who would like to migrate there. However,\nin NNUE, it is then frequently assumed that the supply of housing will limit potential\nin-migration, in turn partially determining whether firms can come into a region and\ncreate jobs, and in the case where housing supply would limit population growth, the\nresulting labour force would be limited (hence placing limits on expansion of firms),\ndriving up housing prices, nominal wages up and real wages down. In other words, in\norder to fully integrate this sector, it must be assumed that it has long-term power to\nenter into a variety of factor substitution and price adjustments, not just on the\n\u2018unimportant\u2019 margin, but in magnitudes that fundamentally affect the prices (wages)\nand quantities (population) of regional economies and bring about an equilibrium\nconsisting of strong real wage\/income convergence in the short-run and nominal wage\/\nincome convergence in the long-run.\nAll in all, the fundamental architecture of these theories is based on the notion that\nthere are many forces that enter into parameters for locating jobs, people and housing,\nand that their elasticities of substitution are the main interest of researchers attempting\nThe challenge for geography and economics . 337\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nto find out what structures a given equilibrium arrangement of the spatial economy,\nand how such equilibria change over time. To the core question of what drives regional\npopulation change, both NEG and new neoclassical urban economics responds that\n\u2018people go to jobs, and jobs go to people, more or less simultaneously\u2019 (cf. Muth, 1971).\nBoth NEG and new neoclassical urban economics share the vision of this economy as\na set of tradeoffs where there are no identifiable starting points that are causally more\nimportant or sequentially earlier than others in determining the subsequent pathways of\nchange. They differ on the details, in the specific structural determinants, elasticities,\ntime frames of adjustments, and some of the outcomes. This agnosticism about causes\nand sequences of change has the advantage of allowing many possible forces to be\nconsidered in an open manner. But it has the parallel disadvantage of eliminating, by\nassumption, the possibility of hierarchies of causes or directions of causality in\ngenerating major changes in the space economy. For example, if theory is neutral as to\nwhether people go to jobs or jobs go to people, how can it explain what sets off a\nsequence of interactions that leads to development of some previously-underdeveloped\nplaces or de-development of others?\n4. Firms come first, and people go to jobs\nAre there some forces that are \u2018leaders\u2019 and others \u2018followers\u2019 in generating changes in\nspatial patterns? A realistic view of the history of spatial development suggests that\nwhat moves the spatial economy forward is the creation of new production possibility\nfrontiers. At the leading edge of technology, this involves the innovation of processes\nand products; at the \u2018cost-price\u2019 frontier of the economy, it consists of the forces that\nopen up new factor supplies or conditions of production (such as through liberalizing\ntrade or improving transport infrastructure).\nIn the case of innovations at the technological frontier of the economy\u2014 such as\nmajor new types of products (including the birth of new sectors), applications of\ninnovations to create new processes in other sectors, or development of new\norganizational capacities for delivering packages of services not previously possible\u2014\nthere are two consequences that have been observed time and again. The first is that\nsuch activities have a propensity to agglomeration, because they involve forms of\ntransactional, output and informational uncertainty, and require scarce knowledge.\nThese are costly attributes that can be managed through combinations of organiza-\ntional fragmentation and the high levels of external transacting it engenders, as well as\nthe pooling of resources (Duranton and Puga, 2004). This is one of the biggest overlaps\nbetween the NEG and EG; in fact, the latter had a flourishing literature on\nagglomeration in the 1980s, before the seminal NEG papers were published.\nHowever, geographers cannot generally agree with how both the NEG and the\nNNUE interpret the broader economic effects of innovation and agglomeration. For\neconomic geographers, the determination of factor and output prices in\ninnovation-driven agglomerations is not a standard competitive equilibrium, nor in\nmany cases does it even represent market-clearing (with no excess) in any realistic sense\nof that term. It matters little whether we call the spatial pattern of firms and people an\nequilibrium or not (a hot-button issue which has little practical importance). What is\nimportant is that in innovation-driven sectors, firms and places, factor and product\nmarkets have auctioning processes that raise prices above the standard zero-excess rule.\n338 . Storper\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThus, there tend to be high rates of capital accumulation by firms and high real wages\n(wealth accumulation) for people, and high real regional per capita incomes that diverge\nsubstantially from other regions for long periods of time. The endowment effects of\nthese processes then have strong impacts on future states of the economy in general and\ncertain regions in particular.\nWhen such developments involve radical innovations\u2014such as computing or\nbiotechnology\u2014they seem to create \u2018windows of locational opportunity\u2019, in the sense\nthat they are not held down by pre-existing external economies or factor supplies\n(Scott and Storper, 1987). Their \u2018newness\u2019 obviates the advantages of older environ-\nments and may even make them into obstacles. In other cases, where innovation builds\non existing industries, but is nonetheless substantial, the new activity may regenerate an\nexisting production agglomeration, but substantially transform its growth and local\ndevelopment dynamics. In somewhat later stages, usually the early expansion of\ncommercialization, only a very restricted number of regions can meet the basic\nrequirements of firms, whatever the price of land, capital and labour in these regions\nmay be.\nIf this Schumpeterian thinking is incorporated into theory, then it has enormous\nconsequences for how regions are seen to \u2018capture\u2019 or attract these economy-driving\ninnovative activities. In the perfectly competitive parts of the economy, some activities\nmight have flexible factor coefficients and firms might be like \u2018putty\u2019. This represents a\nsmall basket of activities, mostly in low-technology sectors. In other sectors, where the\nfactor coefficients are largely fixed by technology, but products are standardized and\ntrade costs are low, then the standard sorting of places\/activities occurs through factor\ncosts of places. But in the leading edges of the economy, both such mechanisms of\nspatial sorting are largely irrelevant. Put bluntly, firms have semi-fixed factor\ncoefficients; but they have few locational choices in these sectors because inputs\n(people, skills and organizational competences) are rare and specialized and outputs are\nnot standardized. Moreover, change is so rapid as to make competitive market-clearing\ninexistent over relevant locational decision-making and investment periods. This means\nthat people go to jobs, both in a temporal sequence and as a representation of the\nhierarchy of causes that should go into the architecture of a theory.\nA second case of major change in the spatial organization of the economy is more\nsubtle than the first. What occurs when there are major \u2018shocks\u2019 to transport costs, big\nchanges in openness to trade (e.g. changing of tariff or trade barriers), or other such\n\u2018events\u2019? The sequence of adjustments is that firms respond to such conditions by\nre-organizing and re-locating, insofar as the shocks are big enough to overcome existing\nsunk costs or agglomeration economies. This in turn changes the location of labour\npools that they can now access. Firms may, in this sense, \u2018go to people\u2019, and this is\nobservable in contemporary delocalization to national peripheries and off-shoring to\nless-developed countries. From these initial starting points, secondary processes unfold,\nincluding the migration of people to jobs, and this in turn unleashes additional local\ndevelopment processes such as growth of home markets and local economic feedbacks.\nThe causal sequence\u2014what starts things off\u2014and the hierarchy of causes, is clear.\nThe locally negative version of this process may involve a regional economy that is\nundiversified and which suffers a major \u2018relocation shock\u2019. Once this occurs, there is\nthe possibility of cumulative downward spirals\u2014through unemployment and\nout-migration, but these are different from those predicted by standard theory. When\njobs go away, the decline of non-tradable sectors leads to degradation of the local built\nThe challenge for geography and economics . 339\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nenvironment (absent significant public investment), because quantity adjustments of\nhousing and building are slow. Prices decline, leading to accumulation of negative\nexternalities and reputation effects or \u2018images\u2019 of the place. At the same time, migration\nmay not be fluid enough to adjust local labour supply to demand (social relationships,\npsychological costs and such). But certain labour prices may be rigid due to institutions,\nconventions and contracts. This pathway of adjustment can be sufficiently complex on\nboth price and quantity sides that it preserves outcomes that are far from any standard\nnotion inter-regional nominal or real income convergence. If the resulting image\ndegradation occurs at a larger regional scale, it can bring durable effects on subsequent\ninvestment and the pathway of economic adjustment, long after labour price rigidities\nhave disappeared and even when housing and land become very cheap. This is the\nnegative type of circular and cumulative causation that mirrors the positive type that is\nfound in \u2018hot\u2019 growth centres. The process of spatial economic development is riddled\nwith these dynamics, not the smooth substitutions and mean reversions around which\nmost models of NEG and NNUE are built. This is the spatial version of the critiques of\nthe equilibrium framework that have been made in a long line of thinkers from Keynes\nthrough Schumpeter and Douglass North.\nCan such forces of discontinuous and complex change be brought \u2018within\u2019 economic\ngeography and regional development theories? No social science theory can completely\nendogenize all causes of change. The problem with most spatial economics today (NEG\nor NNUE) is not that they totally ignore these forces, as that they bracket these causes\nand the pathways of their effects too strongly. They do not attempt to integrate them\nwith systematically relevant time horizons. They are mostly backward looking. Because\nof their requirements of theoretical consistency, but in defiance of observable reality,\nthey exaggerate the importance of a hypothetical arrival point of no-excess equilibrium.\nHence, they obscure the out-of-equilibrium prices and quantities that are commonplace,\nand how they affect future endowments. This in turn prevents them from realistically\nassessing how today\u2019s development affects future evolution and spatial distribution of\neconomic capacities and hence the long-term process of spatial distribution of\ndevelopment and incomes.\n5. Methods\nAnother issue that separates EG from NEG and NNUE is that the two latter use\nmore econometrics than the former. Econometrics is good at detecting repeated,\nlarge number influences on outcomes, but notoriously bad at detecting the causes\nof major shifts in development patterns, the \u2018shocks\u2019 mentioned above. Change\ncan sometimes be detected using such methods, but it requires a lot of luck and \u2018art\u2019\nto identify the points at which the structural determinants shifted. It is easy to miss\nthem unless there is a clear orientation to change and dynamics, and to some kind of\npossible causal hierarchy built into the research effort in advance and as a matter of\nsubstantive theoretical commitment. Moreover, once huge numbers of factors are\nthrown into a causal mix and it is assumed that their respective rates of change\nreveal their mutual \u2018causal\u2019 cross-elasticities, then even excellent econometrics can\nobscure the detection of major events, shocks, and causal sequences that may lie\nunderneath more continuous subsequent adjustments. Assuming that most change is\nthe incremental outcome of knife-edge and widely available arbitrages of preferences\n340 . Storper\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nand factors is an overbearing and largely unproven assumption about the world and\nhow it works.\n6. Economic geography\nThe response of much work from economic geographers is to go in the opposite\ndirection from the spatial economists, emphasizing that spatial economic development\nis the result of unique, context-driven, place-specific combinations of forces that, as a\nconsequence, can neither be modelled nor even subject to large-scale causal inquiry. At\nbest, they can sometimes be captured in descriptive typologies. This extreme has its own\nweaknesses, to which we now turn, but we shall also observe that EG has developed\nsome key insights into spatial development that could fruitfully be absorbed into a\nrevitalized NEG framework.\nEG refers here to a diverse body of work on spatial economics, from geographers,\nempirically-minded regional economists and certain branches of innovation and\norganization studies. There is less agreement on theory and methods than in the NEG\nand NNUE, and hence EG is more difficult to characterize succinctly.\nSince the 1980s, EG scholars have made substantial progress in understanding how\nagglomerations function. They have investigated their local labour markets, the\ngeography of technological spillovers, and regional contexts of formal rules and\ninformal norms and conventions. All these appear to shape the ways that agglomer-\nations function and their ongoing development, decline or resilience in the face of\nchallenge.\nWithin this field, economic geographers have made considerable efforts\u2014paralleling\nthose of the economists\u2014to see local and regional processes in the wider context of\nopen economy forces. This has spurred considerable work on local versus long-distance\nrelationships (mirroring the concern with trade costs in the other literature), and how\nthe division of labour and fragmentation of production systems develops. The\ngeographers\u2019 approach to trade costs stresses the divide between innovative or\nuncertainty-dominated activities and routinized ones, noting their tendency to have\ndifferent organizational structures (scale and scope of firms, degree of intermediate\ntransactions) and hence trade costs (Scott, 1988; 2004).\nBoth NEG and EG are interested in dynamic aspects of these forces. Lower transport\ncosts could lead to spatial concentration, not just in the simple case of serving big\nmarkets from large-scale firms and plants, but through more subtle dynamic\nreorganizations of sectors, such that there is an endogenous component to resulting\nunit trade costs. In this view, lower trade costs seem to heighten competition in far-flung\nmarkets (eliminating old spatial monopoly effects) and lead firms to speed up the\nintroduction of new products, which in turn introduces new forms of complexity and\nuncertainty into their strategies, hence raising unit trade costs upstream, as they\nfragment production systems to be more flexible and reactive, and this in turn leads to\nspatial concentration (Duranton and Storper, 2008).\nTheories of spatial economic development face an additional challenge: how to\ncharacterize the pattern of growth and decline of places at a high-enough level of\nresolution. This task is not the same as understanding the average characteristics of\ngrowing and declining places, or the average trajectory of agglomeration or dispersion.\nMany economists choose to smooth the pattern around means and trends in means and\nThe challenge for geography and economics . 341\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nto consider that cases that are far off the means are there because of \u2018random effects\u2019 or\n\u2018noise\u2019. Geographers tend to call these same effects \u2018complex, specific development\nprocesses,\u2019 and believe that they should be taken seriously and even theorized. These\ndifferences reflect conflicting underlying convictions about spatial-economic develop-\nment along the lines I have been tracing. Thus, for most economists, dispersions around\nthe mean are just a matter of time, because \u2018history matters\u2019 only for a while following\nrandom shocks (until everything reverts to the mean, in spatial equilibrium theories). In\nthe NEG, the new local equilibria around agglomerations can temporarily involve some\nfairly important spatial price differentials between dense and big regions and less dense\nor small regions. Unlike the out-of-equilibrium view explained above, however, such\ndifferences must strictly reflect spatial productivity differentials, not alternative\nspatially-differentiated auctioning of factors (with rents and the accumulation of\nendowments and path dependencies from them). For most other economists, the noise\nis simply dealt with by introducing controls. Geographers are less persuaded about\nnoise, and more tempted to believe that local, agglomeration-based growth processes\nhave unobserved specificities that are masked by economists\u2019 theories and methods; as\nnoted above, some geographers also believe that the notion of general spatial\nequilibrium actually obscures the durable economic differences between places and\nprevents accurate mapping of prices, quantities and endowments.\nIn contrast to spatial economists, geographers have spent considerable effort on\nexplaining the \u2018where\u2019 of agglomeration, and have been partially successful at this.\nFirst, they have argued\u2014even before NEG existed\u2014that important new innovations\ncreate \u2018windows of locational opportunity\u2019 in the sense that the input structures and\nlabour skills of previously-existing industries may be of little relevance to new sectors\n(Scott and Storper, 1987). If such existing activities are also institutionally-organized,\nthey may even hinder new development by monopolizing resources, attention and skills\n(Chinitz, 1961). Such regions may not be able to capture new industries in spite of the\ngreater size of their home markets as compared to alternative less-developed locations.\nIt is important to note that this is a basic\u2014\u2018Schumpeterian\u2019\u2014addition to spatial\neconomics, but it has not been taken up by NEG theorists.\nSecond, geographers have made efforts to theorize the generation or capture of\ninnovative activities by regions, or at least how regions \u2018pair up\u2019 with such activities.\nEvolutionary economic geographers argue that in well-developed regions, the\npreviously-existing routines and competences of firms, labour and institutions shape\ntheir ability to capture new activities, what kinds of innovations they generate, and\nwhat kinds of blockages to resilience they may exhibit (Boschma and Frenken, 2006;\nBoschma and Martin, 2007). They draw directly on evolutionary economics\u2019 notion\nthat technology is path-dependent. Thus, regions will tend to develop or capture\nactivities that are technologically-related (\u2018related variety\u2019). This is a fundamental\ninsight, but it is probably more adapted to \u2018European\u2019 regions\u2019 tendency to move up\nquality ladders in related areas. \u2018American style\u2019 innovation, however, has a higher\nproportion of more radical innovations, which are not well-explained by the\nrelated-variety concept. In the spectacular case of the US semiconductor\/IT industry,\npre-existing agglomerations of telephone and broadcast equipment on the US East\nCoast did not prevent the sector from clustering in Silicon Valley, 4600 km distant.\nSilicon Valley itself had no strongly identifiable technological precursors of the IT\nindustry. In the developing world, the rapid ascension up the technology ladder by\nSouth Korea cannot be explained as an evolutionary process of related variety; the\n342 . Storper\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nKoreans, like Silicon Valley, pulled off radical spatial and economic ruptures with the\npast. This is also what happened when the US aerospace industry located in\nLos Angeles in the 1920s, or the film industry did in the 1910s. There are additional\nexamples in 19th century Europe.\nGeographers have also actively explored institutionalist approaches to the origins of\nagglomerations, the spatial sorting of economic activity, and the matching of regions to\nactivities (Farole et al., 2010). If such things as: technology, trade costs, agglomeration\nand migration give rise to broad tendencies in the sorting of activities to places, they are\nnonetheless potentiated or blocked by regional social forces, which are also unevenly\ndistributed among places. The \u2018dark matter\u2019 of regional development is the specificity of\nhuman interactions from one place to another, its context. \u2018Context\u2019 refers to the\nmicroeconomic ways that the behaviours of agents are structured through institutio-\nnalized, spatially-differentiated forces (Storper, 2009).\n\u2018Institutions\u2019 can be considered at two different scales. At the sectoral or activity\nscale, any agglomeration will have such features as entrepreneurial and labour market\nnetworks; business associations; specially-adapted relations with local government;\ntechnology and R&D networks; and possibly even local or regional circuits of finance\n(such as venture capital today). There is abundant recent literature on such phenomena,\nat the borderline of geography, sociology and management studies (Saxenian, 1994;\nPowell and Sandholtz, 2011; Powell et al., 2011). Another scale is that of the region\u2014\nits formal public-sector institutions, the institutions of economic life that\ncross-over sectors, and the institutions of civic life that involve actors from many\ndifferent sectors and interact with the economic and public-sector institutions.\nSome promising cases studies have been carried out along these lines (Safford, 2009).\nOthers have tried to theorize such institutions, their micro-economic properties,\npathways of change and relationship to regional development and resilience\n(Storper, 2005, 2008; Rodriguez-Pose and Storper, 2005). All in all, then, some pieces\nof the \u2018where\u2019 puzzle are in place, but geographers need to relate them more strongly to\nthe NEG and NNUE frameworks of open-economy spatial development; at the same\ntime, economists would do well to try and incorporate the dispersion of growth\nprocesses in their frameworks and the causes of such dispersion through selection and\nmatching of places and activities, rather than through largely vacuous statistical control\nstrategies.\n7. Elements of a framework\nIn light of the above, a framework for the field should deal with both allocation and\nadjustment of spatial patterns \u2018within\u2019 a set of parameters, as well as major causes of\ngrowth and change. Stated differently, it should deal with both large-scale, continuous\nor \u2018regular\u2019 growth processes, and be able to incorporate \u2018shocks\u2019 and \u2018events.\u2019 It\nshould, moreover, incorporate endogenous regional dynamics that are potentially\nnon-linear and that themselves generate further sudden change and local selection\nprocesses. In order to do this, it may be time to revisit some of the basic tasks of the\nfield. What are the most fundamental behaviours and processes that could be\nconsidered building blocks of a renewed framework?\nResearch on economic growth has long struggled with the relationship between\nstructures and events. Formal economic models, as well as inductively empirical\nThe challenge for geography and economics . 343\n at London School of Econom\nics and Political Science on D\necem\nber 18, 2014\nhttp:\/\/joeg.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \napproaches, are structural, in the sense that they seek the parameters that are associated\nwith growth across a wide panel of regions. But decisive singular events are often cited\nwhen the medium-run fates of particular economies are cited: Detroit declines\n\u2018because\u2019 of the restructuring and decline of the American car industry; Los Angeles\nhas declining per capita income \u2018because\u2019 of a massive wave of low-skilled immigrants\nin the 1980s and the downsizing of the Cold War military-industrial complex in the\n1990s; Washington, DC becomes richer \u2018because\u2019 of rapid growth in the high-wage\nlobbying industry. Often, the latter are treated as exogenous shocks in formal models,\nbut if such events are frequent and important shapers of growth, then much that is\nessential to explanation is being arbitrary excluded from the construction of the\nframework.\nThis ambiguity is particularly potent with respect to agglomeration-generated\nspecialization. Theories of agglomeration show that localization economies have a\nstructural character, in that once started, they can be strongly self-reinforcing; but as\nnoted, explaining their origins may require recourse to one-off events as well as\nstructural factors. Two future strategies to analyse the causes of growth of regions can\nnow be suggested. The first would consist of structured, in-depth comparisons of the\ngrowth trajectories of different areas, using a set of standardized categories such as\nsorting, selecting and shaping. The result would be rich in detail and \u2018on the ground\u2019\naccuracy, but it would have few degrees of freedom.\nA second approach would require large-scale data. As noted, the problem with most\nexisting econometric analysis of urban and regional growth is that it may identify\ncertain structural determinants of growth, but does so in a time-invariant manner, and\nhas difficulty separating fixed effects from the forces that shape pathways and select\ncities into different growth experiences. An ideal way out of this dilemma would be to\nbe able to estimate the sources for growth over a wide panel of cities for different time\nperiods. High quality, sufficiently disaggregated data on the nature of specialization,\nhuman capital and institutions would be required, as well as those for a wide set of\ncontrols. Once the structural determinants for different periods are estimated and\ncompared, then a further stage of research would consist in estimating them for\nindividual city-regions.\nFinally, research on the geography of development would benefit from assembling\nrigorous data on events\/shocks, not simply on panels of fixed effects, structural\ndeterminants or controls. For example, having data on the establishment and lock-in of\nlocalizations, or on other time-dependent shocks such as technologies that shock trade\ncosts of existing sectors, or of changes in institutions that alter comparative advantages,\nand then estimating their effects jointly with structural determinants over different time\nperiods would get us much closer to measuring sequential (possibly path-determining)\nforces and structural determinants in a single model.\nThis would represent a significant departure from most of the research that is\nreported today, in that it would join approaches that are radically separated in\nacademia: large-scale quantitative analysis of structural determinants as favored by\neconomists, and large-scale comparative development, as in the methodological\ntradition of Barrington Moore (1966) or Charles Tilly (1984), with the substantive\ncontemporary concerns of comparative growth economics, and the \u2018on the ground\u2019\nsensibilities of geographers. Though the challenge is daunting, only an approach that\nmelds structure, events and processes, and hence can tackle directions of causality, is\nlikely to advance us significantly in understanding the complex problem of differential\n344 .
