LAINE-PEARSON1 AND P. E. HYDON1\n1Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, UK\nf.laine-pearson@surrey.ac.uk; p.hydon@surrey.ac.uk\n(Received 8 June 2005 and in revised form 24 January 2006)\nThis paper describes particle transport in Stokes \ufb02ow in a two-dimensional corner\nwhose walls oscillate, which is a simple model for particle transport in the pulmonary\nalveoli. Formally speaking, the wall motion produces a perturbation to the well-\nknown Mo\ufb00att corner eddies. However, this \u2018perturbation\u2019 is dominant as the corner\nis approached. The motion of particles is regular near to the corner. Far from\nthe corner, chaotic motion within the main part of the \ufb02ow is restricted to very\nsmall regions. We deduce that there is competition between the far-\ufb01eld motion that\ngenerates eddies and the wall motion. The relative strengths of these two motions\ndetermines whether a given particle moves regularly or chaotically. Consequently,\nthere is an intermediate region in which chaotic transport is maximized.\n1. Introduction\nThis mathematical study is motivated by an ongoing investigation into particle\nmotion in the lung, led by Tsuda, that combines physiological, mathematical and\ncomputational studies of chaos in alveoli. These are cavities in the lower airway walls\nin which recirculation can occur. Tsuda, Henry & Butler (1995) examined the e\ufb00ects\nof cyclic expansion and contraction of alveolar walls on \ufb02uid \ufb02ow in such a cavity by\ndeveloping a numerical model. It was observed that low-Reynolds-number alveolar\n\ufb02ow can be extremely complex; it was presumed that the alveolated duct structure\nand its time-dependent motion induced this complexity. In a related study, Haber\net al. (2000) developed an analytical model of a cyclically expanding and contracting\nspherical alveolus and its vicinity. Their results supported the observation that there\nis a level of complexity of particle mixing in this region of the lungs. Moreover, the\ngeometric features of structural alveolation and rhythmic expansion were given as\nthe mechanism for chaotic mixing of particles. The numerical simulations of Henry,\nButler & Tsuda (2002) quanti\ufb01ed the e\ufb00ects of cyclic expansion and contraction of\nan alveolated duct upon particle motion in the model alveoli. Lagrangian tracking of\n\ufb02uid particles indicated that the trajectories exhibit unpredictable stretched and folded\npatterns. These observations led Tsuda et al. (2002) to hypothesize that chaotic \ufb02ow\ncan occur in alveolated airways, and that this can result in \ufb02ow-induced aerosol mixing\nand deposition deep in the lung. Tsuda\u2019s group tested this hypothesis by performing\n\ufb02ow visualization experiments in excised animal lungs. They ventilated lungs with\nultra-low-viscosity, polymerizable, Newtonian \ufb02uids of two colours. Each lung was\n\ufb01rst \ufb01lled with white \ufb02uid, then ventilated with blue \ufb02uid for a number of cycles,\nensuring that the Reynolds number remained low throughout the experiment. Then\nventilation was halted and the \ufb02uids were polymerized to make casts that showed the\n\ufb01nal position of \ufb02uid particles. Recirculation had occurred in many alveoli, and there\nwas substantial mixing of the \ufb02uids after just two cycles of inspiration and expiration.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n380 F. E. Laine-Pearson and P. E. Hydon\nThe current paper investigates the mechanism by which chaotic particle motion can\noccur in a two-dimensional cavity with recirculating \ufb02uid, when the cavity expands\nand contracts periodically. We restrict attention to Stokes \ufb02ow, which is the \ufb02ow\nregime that operates in the alveoli. Furthermore, it is assumed that particles move\npassively with the \ufb02uid. For boundary conditions, we chose a simple shape that admits\nrecirculation, namely a corner region. This study aims to qualify the phenomena\noccurring when recirculating particles are a\ufb00ected by rhythmic wall motion and this\nwill be achieved by drawing from the mathematical theory developed for Hamiltonian\ndynamical systems.\nCorner \ufb02ows \u2013 and their three-dimensional counterparts \u2013 have been considered\nin the literature by many authors, including Mo\ufb00att (1964), Liu & Joseph (1978),\nWeidman & Calmidi (1999), Shankar (2000), Chetan, Weidman & Davis (2005). The\nseminal work on Stokes \ufb02ow in a corner is Mo\ufb00att (1964), which demonstrated that a\nsequence of eddies can be generated by a \ufb02ow past the corner, provided that the angle\nbetween the walls of the corner does not exceed 2\u03c6critical \u2248 146.3\u25e6. As the corner is\napproached, successive eddies are of decreasing size and greatly decreasing intensity.\nEach eddy is at least 350 times weaker than its larger neighbour.\nCorner eddies can be generated in a triangular container of viscous \ufb02uid when\na cylinder is rotated anywhere inside it. Mo\ufb00att hypothesized that it should be\nstraightforward to observe one eddy, but that to observe a sequence of them might\npresent insurmountable experimental di\ufb03culties. Fifteen years later, Taneda (1979)\nrealized two eddies in succession.\nThe purpose of the current paper is to investigate the qualitative nature of particle\ntransport when an externally driven antisymmetric Stokes \ufb02ow in a corner of angle\nless than 2\u03c6critical is perturbed by wall motion. The \ufb02ow \ufb01eld is described in \u00a7 2. In \u00a7 3,\nthe equations of motion for a passive particle are written as a Hamiltonian system.\nThis formulation plays an important part in revealing the behaviour of particle trajec-\ntories, and gives some insight into the requirements for the breakup of recirculating\nparticle paths, as discussed in \u00a7 4.\n2. The \ufb02ow \ufb01eld\n2.1. Steady \ufb02ow in the unperturbed corner\nThroughout the paper, we use carets to denote dimensional variables; these are\nremoved when variables are non-dimensionalized.\nMo\ufb00att (1964) considered two-dimensional Stokes \ufb02ow in a rigid corner, which\nis induced by an arbitrary \ufb02ow past the corner at a large distance. In plane polar\ncoordinates (r\u02c6 , \u03b8), the Stokes equation for the streamfunction \u03c8\u02c6(r\u02c6 , \u03b8), namely \u22074\u03c8\u02c6 =0,\nadmits separated solutions of the form \u03c8\u02c6 =Re{r\u02c6\u03bb0f (\u03b8; \u03bb0)}. If the walls are at \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c60\nthen the boundary conditions are\n\u03c8\u02c6,r\u02c6 = \u03c8\u02c6,\u03b8 = 0 at \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c60;\nthe comma denotes partial di\ufb00erentiation. For antisymmetric \ufb02ow with \u03bb0 \u0005\u2208 {0, 1, 2},\nwhich occurs in corner eddies,\nf (\u03b8; \u03bb0) = K0[cos((\u03bb0 \u2212 2)\u03c60) cos(\u03bb0\u03b8) \u2212 cos(\u03bb0\u03c60) cos((\u03bb0 \u2212 2)\u03b8)],\nwhere K0 is a complex constant that is determined by conditions far from the corner.\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb0 are related to the angle \u03c60 by\n(\u03bb0 \u2212 2) tan((\u03bb0 \u2212 2)\u03c60) = \u03bb0 tan(\u03bb0\u03c60), (2.1)\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nParticle transport in a moving corner 381\nwhich is trigonometrically equivalent to\nsin(2\u03c60\u00b50) = \u2212\u00b50 sin(2\u03c60), where \u00b50 = \u03bb0 \u2212 1.\nMo\ufb00att showed that every eigenvalue is complex if \u03c60 <\u03c6critical, and thus the \ufb02ow\nis a sequence of eddies. Following Mo\ufb00att, we consider only the \ufb02ow corresponding\nto the dominant eigenvalues \u03bb0 and \u03bb0 (in other words, the pair of eigenvalues with\nsmallest positive real part). Here\n\u03bb0 =\n(\n1 +\n\u03be\n2\u03c60\n)\n+ i\n(\n\u03b7\n2\u03c60\n)\n,\nwhere \u03be \u2248 4 and \u03b7 is O(1). Note that as \u03c60 tends to zero, \u03bb0R \u2261Re{\u03bb0} grows rapidly.\nThe range of values of r\u02c6 for which the Stokes approximation is valid is given by the\ncondition\nRe =\nDr\u02c6 \u03bb0R\n\u03bd\n\b 1,\nwhere Re is the Reynolds number based on distance from the corner, \u03bd is the\nkinematic viscosity of the \ufb02uid, and D is a dimensional constant such that f (\u03b8; \u03bb0)\/D\nis of order unity. As \u03bb0R is positive, inertial forces are negligible for su\ufb03ciently small\nr\u02c6 . From here on, such a \ufb02ow is referred to as \u2018Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow\u2019. Figure 1 illustrates typical\nparticle paths in Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow. The initial conditions are spaced out along the line\ny =0. The particles on the right-hand eddy move clockwise, while the particles on the\nleft-hand eddy move anticlockwise. Consequently, a separatrix lies between these two\neddies; it is a curved line that is attached to each wall. Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow has an in\ufb01nite\nsequence of eddies in the corner, which have been generated by the far-\ufb01eld \ufb02ow.\nEach eddy lies in its own cell, whose boundaries are the walls of the corner and a\nseparatrix on either side. The pair of eddies of \ufb01gure 1 has been chosen speci\ufb01cally\nso that the two distinct types of behaviour that appear when the walls are moved can\nbe clearly observed (see later \ufb01gures).\n2.2. Quasi-steady \ufb02ow\nNow consider what happens when the steady \ufb02ow is perturbed by a periodic wall\nmotion that keeps the maximum angle of the corner less than 2\u03c6critical. Let u\u02c6 = u\u02c6r er +\nu\u02c6\u03b8 e\u03b8 be the velocity \ufb01eld with respect to the steady frame coordinates (r\u02c6 , \u03b8). The\nincompressibility condition in cylindrical polar coordinates is\n1\nr\u02c6\n(r\u02c6 u\u02c6r ),r\u02c6 +\n1\nr\u02c6\n(u\u02c6\u03b8 ),\u03b8 = 0.\nAs the corner region is simply connected, there exists a streamfunction \u03c8\u02c6(r\u02c6 , \u03b8, t\u02c6)\nsuch that u\u02c6r = \u03c8\u02c6,\u03b8 \/r\u02c6 and u\u02c6\u03b8 =\u2212\u03c8\u02c6,r\u02c6 . Therefore particle motion is described by the\nequations\ndr\u02c6\ndt\u02c6\n=\n1\nr\u02c6\n\u03c8\u02c6,\u03b8 , r\u02c6\nd\u03b8\ndt\u02c6\n= \u2212\u03c8\u02c6,r\u02c6 .\nThe walls are at \u03b8 =\u00b1\u03c6, where\n\u03c6 = \u03c60[1 + \u0007 sin(\u03c9t\u02c6)];\nhere \u03c9 is the frequency of oscillation and 0\u0001 \u0007 < 1. Therefore the boundary conditions\nare\n\u03c8\u02c6,\u03b8 = 0, \u03c8\u02c6,r\u02c6 = \u2213\u0007\u03c60\u03c9r\u02c6 cos(\u03c9t\u02c6) on \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c6.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n382 F.

Two\nconsecutive eddies are shown. As the \ufb02ow is steady, particle paths coincide with streamlines\n(see Acheson 1990). (b) The speed (s) of the eight particles of Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow when 2\u03c60 = 20\n\u25e6\nand K0 = 1\/2\u03c0 are tracked for t =0 . . . 10, where t relates to the \u2018non-dimensionalized time\u2019 of\nthe quasi-steady \ufb02ow. The highest \ufb01ve curves represent particles belonging to the right-hand\neddy, while the lower line represents three particles in the left-hand eddy (the three curves here\ncoincide at this scale). Scanning from left to right of (a), and reading from bottom to top of\n(b), the periods of the particles are approximately 1717, 1038, 731, 68.1, 18.7, 7.8, 4.2, 2.3 time\nunits, respectively.\nTo non-dimensionalize the problem, let\nt =\n\u03c9t\u02c6\n2\u03c0\n, r =\nr\u02c6\na\n, \u03c8 =\n\u03c8\u02c6\na2\u03c9\n,\nwhere a is a convenient length scale. We discuss our choice of a at the end of this\nsection. De\ufb01ne \u03b12 = a2\u03c9\/\u03bd to be the Womersley number. Provided that \u03b12\/2\u03c0\b 1,\nunsteady inertia can be neglected and the \ufb02ow is quasi-steady. Thus the combined\n\ufb02ow is simply a superposition of Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow and the \ufb02ow generated through wall\nmotion alone (which we shall call the squeeze \ufb02ow for brevity). Hence \u03c8 =\u03c8M +\u03c8W ,\nwhere \u03c8M is the non-dimensional Mo\ufb00att streamfunction for a corner whose walls\nare at \u03b8 =\u00b1\u03c6, and where \u03c8W is the non-dimensional streamfunction associated with\nthe \ufb02ow driven by the wall motion. Speci\ufb01cally,\n\u03c8M (r, \u03b8, t) = KRe{r\u03bb[cos((\u03bb \u2212 2)\u03c6) cos(\u03bb\u03b8) \u2212 cos(\u03bb\u03c6) cos((\u03bb \u2212 2)\u03b8)]}, (2.2)\nwhere \u03bb, which is time dependent, and \u03c6 satisfy\n(\u03bb \u2212 2) tan((\u03bb \u2212 2)\u03c6) = \u03bb tan(\u03bb\u03c6). (2.3)\nAs for the steady \ufb02ow, only the dominant eigenvalues are considered. The amplitude K\ndepends on the far-\ufb01eld \ufb02ow and is assumed to be a real constant for this investigation.\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nParticle transport in a moving corner 383\nThe solution (2.2) satis\ufb01es \u03c8M,\u03b8 =\u03c8M,r =0 on the walls. Therefore the non-zero\nboundary condition produced by the wall motion generates the squeeze \ufb02ow\n\u03c8W (r, \u03b8, t) = \u2212\u0007\u03c60\n(\nr2\n2\n)\ncos(2\u03c0t)\n[\nsin(2\u03b8) \u2212 2\u03b8 cos(2\u03c6)\nsin(2\u03c6) \u2212 2\u03c6 cos(2\u03c6)\n]\n, (2.4)\nwhich is described in Mo\ufb00att (1964). According to Mo\ufb00att & Du\ufb00y (1980), this\ndescribes the Stokes \ufb02ow produced by wall motion when 2\u03c6 < tan(2\u03b8) and r is not\ntoo large. Although the squeeze \ufb02ow is unsteady, the acceleration terms in the Navier\u2013\nStokes equations are negligible in the region near the corner for which\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223d\u03c6dt\u02c6\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r\u02c6\n2\n\u03bd\n\b 1, that is, \u0007\u03c60\u03b12r2 \b 1.\nWe restrict attention to this region from here on, so that the combined \ufb02ow is quasi-\nsteady. Convective inertia is negligible provided that Re is su\ufb03ciently small.\nThe squeeze \ufb02ow is integrable, which can be observed by numerically tracking\nparticles during a half-cycle and noting that they faithfully retrace their paths during\nthe next half-cycle. Moreover, particle motion in the squeeze \ufb02ow satis\ufb01es\n1\n2\u03c0\ndr\ndt\n=\n1\nr\n\u2202\u03c8W\n\u2202\u03b8\nand\n1\n2\u03c0\nd\u03b8\ndt\n= \u22121\nr\n\u2202\u03c8W\n\u2202r\n.\nTherefore\ndr\nd\u03b8\n= \u2212 r\n2\n[\n2 cos(2\u03b8) \u2212 2 cos(2\u03c6)\nsin(2\u03b8) \u2212 2\u03b8 cos(2\u03c6)\n]\n(2.5)\nand\nd\u03b8\ndt\n= 2\u03c0\u0007\u03c60 cos(2\u03c0t)\n[\nsin(2\u03b8) \u2212 2\u03b8 cos(2\u03c6)\nsin(2\u03c6) \u2212 2\u03c6 cos(2\u03c6)\n]\n. (2.6)\nAs \u03c6 is a function of t it follows that \u03c6 can be written as a function of \u03b8 by solving\nthe \ufb01rst-order di\ufb00erential equation (2.6). Substituting this into equation (2.5) gives a\n\ufb01rst-order di\ufb00erential equation, which can be integrated (in principle) to obtain a \ufb01rst\nintegral. The \ufb02ow \u03c8W is integrable essentially because of the reversibility of steady\nStokes \ufb02ow. The adapted Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow (Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow for \u0007 \u0005=0) is not integrable;\nmoreover this \ufb02ow cannot occur independently as it does not satisfy the moving\nboundary conditions.\nFormally, the squeeze \ufb02ow and the modi\ufb01cation to the Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow caused by the\nwall motion combine to produce an O(\u0007) perturbation to the steady Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow.\nHowever, the steady Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow diminishes far more rapidly than the squeeze \ufb02ow\nas the corner is approached. To a \ufb01rst approximation, for 2\u03c60 the decay is O(r\n1+\u03be\/2\u03c60 )\nwhere \u03be \u2248 4. (For example, for 2\u03c60 = 20\u25e6 the decay is O(r13), and for 2\u03c60 = 60\u25e6 the\ndecay is O(r5).) By contrast, the squeeze \ufb02ow is O(r2). Consequently, for r < 1, the\n\u2018perturbation\u2019 to the steady Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow has an increasingly great e\ufb00ect as r \u2192 0. For\ninstance, in the right-hand eddy of \ufb01gure 2, the perturbation is small in the central\nregion, and has an increasing e\ufb00ect in the outer region where r is smaller for much\nof the particle\u2019s motion.\nThere is no intrinsic length scale for the steady Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow. However, when the\nwall motion is added, the two motions are of comparable size only in a limited range\nof values of r\u02c6 . Therefore the appropriate length scale a is the order of magnitude of\nthese values.

Particle motion in the perturbed \ufb02ow\nFor any two-dimensional \ufb02ow with a streamfunction \u03c8(r, \u03b8, t) that is non-\ndimensionalized as above, particle trajectories are obtained from the Lagrangian\nequations of motion\n1\n2\u03c0\ndr\ndt\n=\n1\nr\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03b8\n,\n1\n2\u03c0\nd\u03b8\ndt\n= \u22121\nr\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202r\n.\nThese equations can be written as a Hamiltonian system for R = r2 and \u03b8 , as follows:\ndR\ndt\n= \u2212\u2202H\n\u2202\u03b8\n,\nd\u03b8\ndt\n=\n\u2202H\n\u2202R\n, (3.1)\nwhere the Hamiltonian H is\nH (R, \u03b8, t) = \u22124\u03c0\u03c8(R1\/2, \u03b8, t).\nIn particular, in the absence of wall motion, the Hamiltonian is\nH0(R, \u03b8) = \u22124\u03c0 lim\n\u0007\u21920 \u03c8M\n(\nR1\/2, \u03b8, t\n)\n.\nThe system\ndR\ndt\n= \u2212\u2202H0\n\u2202\u03b8\n,\nd\u03b8\ndt\n=\n\u2202H0\n\u2202R\n, (3.2)\nis integrable; H0 is conserved during a particle\u2019s motion. Consequently there exist\naction-angle coordinates in terms of which the \ufb02ow on each streamline is a steady\nrotation.\nFor the moving corner, the Hamiltonian is H = H0 + H1, where\nH1(R, \u03b8, t) = \u22124\u03c0\u03c8M(R1\/2, \u03b8, t) \u2212 4\u03c0\u03c8W(R1\/2, \u03b8, t) \u2212 H0(R, \u03b8).\nNote that H1 vanishes as \u0007 \u2192 0. Formally, H1 is of order \u0007 provided that\n\u03bb = \u03bb0 + O(\u0007).\nThe Hamiltonian H has been constructed in this way so that ideas from KAM\n(Kolmogorov\u2013Arnol\u2019d\u2013Moser) theory can be consulted. KAM theory is a methodo-\nlogy of how to approach certain problems in perturbation theory that are linked\nwith small devisors. Although there are many variants of the KAM theorem, it\nis the classical KAM theorem, which is concerned with the stability of motions\nin Hamiltonian systems constructed from slightly perturbed integrable Hamiltonian\nsystems, that will be referred to as the \u2018KAM theorem\u2019 here. For H , H0 is the integrable\npart, which is essentially \u03c8M evaluated at \u0007 =0, while H1 is some non-integrable\nperturbation, which accounts for the additional terms generated by the perturbation\nparameter \u0007 through \u03c8W and the compensation of \u03c8M to \u0007 \u0005=0. An assumption of the\ntheory is that \u0007 \b 1.\nThe KAM theorem implies that, if \u0007 is su\ufb03ciently small, most particles will remain\non closed curves (called KAM tori ) that are only slight perturbations of the original\nstreamlines. However, some streamlines break up, in accordance with the Poincare\u00b4\u2013\nBirkho\ufb00 theorem, to form chains of \u2018islands\u2019 bounded by KAM tori which are\nsurrounded by chaotic trajectories. Within each island the same types of structure\noccur in a self-similar manner. As the perturbation increases, KAM tori break up\nto form Cantor sets called cantori, and the chaotic regions increase in size. For even\nlarger perturbations, all KAM tori are destroyed.\nThe KAM theorem is explained in detail in Lichtenberg & Lieberman (1992); a\nsimple overview can be found in Tabor (1989).

For larger perturbations, this geometry disintegrates\nto chaotic advection of particles as can be witnessed, for example, within a \ufb01xed\nrectangular cavity at moderate Reynolds numbers, which has been described by\nOttino (1989) and Horner et al. (2002).\nFigures 2 to 4 show Poincare\u00b4 sections of particle trajectories, which are constructed\nby plotting particle positions at t =0, 1, 2, . . . , 1999. Each \ufb01gure shows several\ntrajectories. The equations of motion have been integrated numerically using an\nexplicit fourth-order Runge\u2013Kutta scheme with a step size of 0.01; there is no obvious\nchange in the \ufb01gures when the step size is halved. Figures 2 and 3 show how the\ntrajectories change as \u0007 is increased from 0.001 to 0.5 for a corner with 2\u03c60 = 20\n\u25e6. For\n2\u03c60 = 60\n\u25e6, \ufb01gure 4 shows the qualitative di\ufb00erences between \u0007 =0 and \u0007 =0.1. Within\nthe assumptions of this study, these examples are qualitatively typical of particle\ntransport in a moving corner. As the parameter values for these illustrations are\nrepresentative, attention will be restricted to describing the nature of particle motion\noccurring there. The interpretation of these \ufb01gures is discussed in the next section.\n4. Discussion\nBefore examining the qualitative nature of particle paths for \u0007 \u0005=0, it is helpful\nto consider the unperturbed motion shown in \ufb01gure 1. Here the corner angle is\n2\u03c60 = 20\n\u25e6. Based on Mo\ufb00att\u2019s analysis of relative intensities, the left-hand eddy is\naround 380 times weaker than the right-hand eddy. So, by the time it takes a particle\nnear the middle of the left-hand eddy to complete a circuit, one near the middle of\nthe right-hand eddy has completed many circuits. This is re\ufb02ected in the trajectory\noutput for particles. For the left-hand eddy, each successive point on the path plotted\nis close to the previous point and the closed orbit is slowly traced out over time. For\nthe right-hand eddy, successive points have a much larger gap between them and the\nparticle completes many circuits before the orbit appears to be closed. So, particles in\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n386 F. E. Laine-Pearson and P. E.

The speed of the\n\ufb01ve particles for the right-hand eddy is represented by the highest \ufb01ve curves, while\nthe lowest line represents the displacement of the three particles for the left-hand\neddy (coinciding here for this scale). The periods illustrate that the particles of the\nleft-hand eddy circulate, relatively speaking, slower than those on the right-hand\neddy. Moreover, when considering each eddy separately, the closer a streamline is to\nthe centre of the eddy, the shorter time it takes for a particle to complete a circuit of\nthe closed curve relating to this streamline.\nWe now examine what happens when \u0007 \u0005=0.

By contrast, the Poincare\u00b4 section for the\nleft-hand eddy appears to be una\ufb00ected by the perturbation.\nFigure 3(a, b) shows the e\ufb00ects of increasing \u0007 to 0.01 and 0.1 respectively. The right-\nhand eddy behaves as expected: the KAM tori break up, so that the chaotic region\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\n388 F. E. Laine-Pearson and P. E. Hydon\nincreases in size. The left-hand eddy remains apparently una\ufb00ected. Indeed even if\n\u0007 is increased to 0.5, as in \ufb01gure 3(c), many particles in the left-hand eddy seem to\nbe moving around closed curves. In fact, the outer orbits have disintegrated, but the\nintermediate ones are merely deformed into \u2018cashew\u2019 shapes. The innermost ones lie\non closed curves in the upper or lower central regions of the cashew (the \ufb01gure shows\none such curve in the lower region).\nFor a resting corner angle of 2\u03c60 = 60\n\u25e6, the relative intensity for consecutive eddies\nwill now be much larger. The smaller of a pair of neighbouring eddies is around\n685 times weaker than its larger neighbour. Figure 4(a) shows unperturbed (\u0007 =0)\nparticle paths for one eddy, while \ufb01gure 4(b, c) shows some trajectories for \u0007 =0.1.\nThe trajectories behave similarly to those in the right-hand eddy in \ufb01gure 2.\nTo help with identifying why there is a di\ufb00erence in behaviour between neighbouring\neddies, let us return to the example with resting corner angle of 20\u25e6. With each eddy,\nthe period depends continuously on the streamfunction. So it is not the case that\nnone of the orbits in the weaker (left) eddy are resonant with the perturbation.\nThe other possibility is that the resonances are very high order. Consider \u0007 =0.001;\nhere the circulation is weaker (compared with \u0007 =0), indicating that this is the case.\n(Quasi-steady Stokes \ufb02ows exhibiting lack of breakup of invariant curves also occur\nin Kaper & Wiggins 1993, for instance.) When \u0007 \u0005\b 1, the KAM theorem is no longer\napplicable. However, it is possible to account for other observed behaviour, as follows.\nThe left-hand eddy is not chaotic, because within it the Mo\ufb00att corner \ufb02ow is a\nperturbation to the back-and-forth motion produced by the squeeze \ufb02ow. A \ufb02uid\nparticle moves into and out of the corner during any cycle, \ufb01nishing very close to\nwhere it started. The di\ufb00erence in position is due to the very weak rotation produced\nby the Mo\ufb00att eddy. Increasing the strength of the squeeze \ufb02ow does not change the\nPoincare\u00b4 section signi\ufb01cantly, unless the squeeze \ufb02ow is so great that particles are\npushed into regions where they can experience strong Mo\ufb00att eddies. This explains\nwhy the left-hand eddy appears unchanged unless \u0007 is large.\nFrom these results we can infer that there is an optimal region for chaotic transport\nin a corner. By \u2018chaotic transport\u2019 we mean that the local Lyapunov exponent is posi-\ntive. For large or strong Mo\ufb00att eddies (in the sense of the relative scale and intensity\nfactors calculated by Mo\ufb00att), the wall motion provides only a weak perturbation,\nso the island chains are thin. For small or weak Mo\ufb00att eddies, the rotation is a\nperturbation to the motion produced by the squeeze \ufb02ow. In either of these cases,\nmost trajectories are regular. Chaotic transport is maximized in the region where the\nsqueeze \ufb02ow is a moderate perturbation to the Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow.\nTo support the hypothesis that there is a region where chaotic transport is maxi-\nmized, consider the next furthest eddy from the corner. Figure 5(a) shows such an\neddy; the step size is 0.0001. This is necessarily smaller than for the previous \ufb01gures\nso that the very fast moving particles of the largest eddy can be adequately tracked,\nespecially near its right-hand separatrix. In \ufb01gure 5(b), perturbing the walls shows\nthe disintegration of its left-hand neighbour (compare with \ufb01gure 3). The particle\ntrajectories of the largest eddy that lie su\ufb03ciently far from the walls appear robust\nto the perturbation. This is expected because at this distance from the corner the\nsqueeze \ufb02ow is a very weak perturbation to the strong rotation of the Mo\ufb00att eddy.\nFigure 5(c) shows that some particles in the largest eddy lie on KAM tori in thin\nislands, as predicted by KAM theory. The thinness of these islands is due to the\nweakness of the squeeze \ufb02ow perturbation.\nThe model examined in this study only focuses on the e\ufb00ect of wall motion on\nrecirculating particles (to leading order for both the Mo\ufb00att \ufb02ow and the squeeze\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 12 Jun 2009 IP address: 131.227.178.139\nParticle transport in a moving corner 389\n\u20130.3\n\u20130.2\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\ny\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\n\u20130.3\n\u20130.2\n\u20130.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\ny\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\nx\n\u20130.06\n\u20130.04\n\u20130.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\ny\n0.995 1.000 1.015 1.010 1.015 1.020\nx\nFigure 5.

Hydon\nresults suggest that in places where the squeeze \ufb02ow driven by the wall motion is\nof the same order of magnitude as recirculation in the centre, some particles move\nchaotically. It is unclear whether or not such motion occurs at the edges of the alveoli.\nThe moving-corner model may be extended to incorporate di\ufb00usion and particle\ninertia. Furthermore, the far-\ufb01eld motion can be adjusted so that K is time-dependent\nand incorporates periodic motion (as well as a time lag). These investigations will be\npresented elsewhere.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have shown that, qualitatively speaking, particle transport in a moving-walled\ncorner occurs in two distinct ways. In eddies near to the corner the wall motion\ndominates, and the Mo\ufb00att eddies provide a weak perturbation. However, this weak\nperturbation drives an average particle motion similar to the motion produced by\nthe steady eddy. Away from the corner the far-\ufb01eld motion dominates, encouraging\nislands of KAM tori inside each other (as in \ufb01gure 3a) and chaotic trajectories to\nform within a limited region, thereby enhancing mixing of particles. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst clear theoretical indication that in small airways, where\nthe Reynolds number is very low, there is a mechanism for producing chaos.\nF. E.
