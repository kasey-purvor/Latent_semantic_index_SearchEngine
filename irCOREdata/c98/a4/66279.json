Five adjacent AVRs\nhave been analysed, located between 57\u25e630\u2032N and 58\u25e630\u2032N and south of any strong Iceland\nhotspot influence. The seabed morphology of each AVR is investigated using sidescan sonar\ndata to determine relative age and eruptive history. Along-axis gravity profiles for each AVR\nare modelled relative to a seismically derived crustal reference model, to reveal the underlying\ncrustal thickness and density structure. Correlating these models with seabed features, crustal\nstructure, ridge segment morphology and relative ages, a model of cyclic ridge segmentation is\ndeveloped in which accretion results in adjacent AVRs with a range of crustal features which,\nwhen viewed collectively, reveal that second-order segments on the Reykjanes Ridge have an\nalong-axis length of \u223c70 km and comprise several adjacent AVRs which, in turn, reflect the\npattern of third-order segmentation. Tectono-magmatic accretion is shown to operate on the\nscale of individual AVRs, as well as on the scale of the second-order segment as a whole.\nKey words: crustal accretion, crustal structure, gravity anomalies, mid-ocean ridges, oceanic\ncrust, residual mantle Bouguer anomaly.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe wealth of swath bathymetry data acquired at mid-ocean ridges\nshows that they are segmented on a variety of scales. Coincident\ngeophysical and geochemical surveys have shown that this segmen-\ntation is reflected along axis in crustal structure and composition as\nwell as thickness. Observations suggest that ridge segmentation is\ncontrolled by along-axis variation in melt supply and that the varia-\ntion in the rate of this supply plays a significant role in the mode by\nwhich new oceanic crust accretes.\nThe episodicity of crustal accretion at slow spreading rates\nhas been highlighted by a comprehensive multidisciplinary study\nof an axial volcanic ridge segment (AVR) of the slow-spreading\nMid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The RAMESSES (Reykjanes Axial\nMelt Experiment: Structural Synthesis from Electromagnetics and\nSeismics\u2014Sinha et al. 1997, 1998; MacGregor et al. 1998; Navin\net al. 1998; Heinson et al. 2000; Peirce & Navin 2002; Topping\n2002; Gardiner 2003) experiments provided evidence from the com-\nbined interpretation of wide-angle seismic, normal incidence seis-\nmic, gravity, controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) and magne-\ntotelluric (MT) data (see Fig. 1) for the existence of a magma cham-\nber beneath an AVR at 57\u25e645\u2032N on the Reykjanes Ridge, which con-\ntains 20\u201340 per cent partial melt (Heinson et al. 2000; MacGregor\net al. 1998), with sufficient melt volume to support \u223c20 000 yr of\ncrustal accretion, and which would cool to subsolidus temperatures\nwithin \u223c1500 yr (MacGregor et al. 1998). The contrast between\ncooling rate and accretion duration, therefore, implies an accre-\ntionary process which has magmatic and amagmatic phases.\nBeneath the RAMESSES AVR the upper mantle down to a depth\nof \u223c50 km below sea level (bsl) is effectively melt free, while be-\ntween \u223c50 and 100 km bsl partial melt is present (Heinson et al.\n2000), which has implications for the mode of delivery of melt from\nthe mantle to the crust (Sinha et al. 1998). Heinson et al. (2000)\nsuggest that the 50\u2013100 km zone is where adiabatic decompression\nmelting forms a layer of partial melt, with its episodic transport\nto the crust occurring either through conduits or through perva-\nsive flow. Alternatively, the region between the base of the crust\nand \u223c50 km bsl could itself also be a source of melt, but which\nhas recently been depleted by rapid transport to the crust. In both\ncases, the absence of a clear conduit or connection between the\n56 C\u00a9 2005 RAS\nTemporal and spatial cyclicity of accretion at slow-spreading ridges 57\nFigure 1. Cross-sectional model of the 57\u25e645\u2032N AVR based on a synthesis of the modelling and interpretation of RAMESSES data sets. The analyses of\nseismic, gravity, electromagnetic and magnetotelluric data suggest that a magma chamber underlies this AVR and that a zone of partial melt extends from\n\u223c50 to 100 km depth in the upper mantle. Note that a break in scale occurs at a depth of 10 km below sea level. After Sinha et al. (1998).\nmelt source and accumulation zones suggests that it is the supply of\nmelt from the mantle to crust that is episodic and, in turn, it is that\nepisodicity that leads to periods of magmatic and amagmatic crustal\naccretion.\nDespite extensive geophysical surveying of the global mid-ocean\nridge system prior to the RAMESSES experiment, the latter was the\nfirst unequivocal observation of an active magmatic system beneath\nridges classified as spreading at slow rates. Contrary to the widely\naccepted view at that time that crustal melt bodies, even of small\ndimensions, could not be maintained at slow spreading rates due\nto an inadequate heat flux, the results of the RAMESSES project\nshowed that they can and do exist. Thus the apparent contradiction\nbetween the requirement for crustal melt bodies to explain struc-\ntural and petrological observations and the majority of geophysical\nobservations (until RAMESES) that suggest that they do not ex-\nist, is best explained if melt-filled magma chambers are transient\nfeatures, related to the episodic influx of melt from the mantle; the\nconsequence of which is a cyclic pattern of accretion. On this basis\ngeophysical observations of crustal melt bodies will be dependent\non identifying a segment that is in the appropriate stage of its life\ncycle, with observation essentially being dependent on being in the\nright place at the right time.\nThe magma chamber model of the RAMESSES Working Group\n(Sinha et al. 1998) is similar, in terms of its layer thicknesses, geome-\ntries and properties, to magma chambers imaged at faster-spreading\nridges using similar surveying methods. This suggests that processes\nof crustal accretion are similar at all spreading rates but, signifi-\ncantly, it is the temporal variability in melt transport from the upper\nmantle to the crust which underpins the differences between the\ncrustal structure and seabed morphology.\nParson et al. (1993), in a separate sidescan sonar study at the Reyk-\njanes Ridge, showed that during periods of magmatic quiescence\nAVRs undergo extensive dismemberment by tectonic forces, while\nmagmatic periods are evidenced by volcanic eruption. The cyclicity\nof crustal accretion is, therefore, imprinted into the seafloor mor-\nphology. However, the temporal dimension to this cyclic accretion\nis poorly understood, with recent studies (e.g. Stewart et al. 2002)\nsuggesting that temporal variability in melt transport is a signifi-\ncant process even at fast-spreading ridges. Such so-called tectono-\nmagmatic cycles may, therefore, reflect a fundamental process in\ncrustal accretion that operates at all spreading rates.\nThe existing extensive, diverse and comprehensive data sets that\nexist at the Reykjanes Ridge make it an ideal location to study the\napparent relationship between the seafloor expression of tectono-\nmagmatic cycles, the underlying crustal structure, the melt supply\nand accumulation process, the timescales of cycles and periodicity\nof melt influx, and their relationship to along-axis segmentation.\n2 S E T T I N G\nThe Reykjanes Ridge is a 900 km section of the slow-spreading\nMAR running from the Bight fracture zone at 57\u25e6N to the Reyk-\njanes Peninsula on Iceland at 63\u25e6N (Fig. 2). Interaction with the\nIceland hotspot results in an axial morphology which changes in\nstyle from median valley in the south to axial rise in the north, ac-\ncompanied by a general shallowing of the seafloor towards Iceland.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\n58 C. Peirce, A. Gardiner and M. Sinha\nFigure 2. Free-air gravity anomaly of the North Atlantic (Sandwell & Smith 1997) shaded to highlight the location of the Reykjanes Ridge and showing the\nchange in ridge orientation at the Bight fracture zone. Also clearly visible are the southerly trending V-shaped ridges thought to be the result of hotspot pulsing\n(Ito 2001). The location of the study area is outlined. Note that the change from median valley to the axial high topography associated with the Iceland hotspot\ncan clearly be seen at \u223c59\u25e6N. Inset shows the location of the ship tracks along which the gravity, magnetic and bathymetry data modelled in this paper were\nacquired. The white outlines show the locations of the TOBI sidescan sonar data acquired during EW9008\/90.\nIto (2001) proposes that magmatic pulsing of the hotspot leads to\nthermal perturbations that propagate radially away from its centre.\nInteraction with the ridge axis results in periods of accretion during\nwhich melt supply is enhanced and thicker crust generated within the\nregion of influence. Southwards propagation of these pulses along\nthe ridge axis is thought to give rise to the V-shaped ridges clearly\nvisible in the gravity field (see Fig. 2\u2014 Vogt 1971).\nThe ridge follows a trend of 036\u25e6 which is oblique to the spreading\ndirection of 096\u25e6 (DeMets et al. 1990), and results in two trends in\nseabed features\u2014one ridge-parallel and one perpendicular to the\nspreading direction. AVRs are oriented orthogonal to the spreading\ndirection and are separated by right-stepping en-echelon offsets.\nFaulting is predominantly perpendicular to the spreading direction\nwithin the neovolcanic, axial region but rotates to a ridge-parallel\ntrend off-axis.\nParson et al. (1993) further developed their seabed observations\ninto a model of crustal accretion, which suggests that each AVR\nhas its own life span comprising a period of magmatic accretion\nfollowed by a period of amagmatic extension. During the mag-\nmatic phase vigorous volcanism leads to the formation and rapid\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\nTemporal and spatial cyclicity of accretion at slow-spreading ridges 59\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nfissure\nvolcanoes conical\nvolcanoes\nlava\nflows\nflat-top\nvolcano\nhummocky\nterrain\nfault\nsediment\ncover\nFigure 3.

The magmatic phase comprises the young\n(a) and adolescent (b) stages, while the tectonic phase includes the mature (c) and old (d) stages. Note that as the life cycle progresses there is a change from\nfissure to conical to flat-topped (shield) volcanoes, reflecting the mode of magma delivery to the seafloor. As AVRs age through their life cycle the dominant\ndirection of faulting changes from spreading orthogonal to ridge-parallel until, eventually, each AVR is completely dismembered.\ngrowth of a linear axial volcano (the AVR), which typically extends\nup to \u223c35 km along-axis (the young stage) (Fig. 3), with AVRs\nonly reaching full maturity as the rate of magmatic activity starts\nto decline (the adolescent stage). With on-going seafloor spread-\ning during the later stages of the magmatic phase and throughout\nthe post-magmatic or tectonic phase, AVRs become dissected by\nmany spreading-orthogonal faults (the mature stage). Eventually,\nthe volcanic terrain of the magmatic phase becomes overprinted\nby younger tectonic features and, ultimately, extinct AVRs become\ncompletely dismembered by faulting (the old stage). Ultimately a\nnew magmatic phase is initiated, leading at first to isolated fresh\nlava flows that overprint the tectonized seafloor, and then to the es-\ntablishment and growth to maturity of a new AVR\u2014the duration of\na cycle being \u223c0.5 Myr (Searle et al. 1998). Under Parson et al.\u2019s\n(1993) tectono-magmatic model, a cycle is defined by the young\nand adolescent stages of the magmatic phase and the mature and\nold stages of the tectonic phase. As crustal structure is intimately\nrelated to melt supply, AVRs in their magmatic phase should, there-\nfore, differ from those undergoing tectonic extension, or from ones\nat the very beginning of their life cycle. Thus, Parson et al.\u2019s (1993)\napproach provides a set of starting assumptions by which adjacent\nAVRs may be relatively aged.\n3 T H E DATA S E T\nTo investigate inter-AVR relationships in the context of the hypoth-\nesis of tectono-magmatic life cycles of accretion requires: (1) a set\nof adjacent AVRs located in a region broadly unaffected by hotspot\ninfluence (i.e. south of 59\u25e6N); (2) co-incident gravity, magnetic and\nbathymetry data; and most importantly, (3) sidescan sonar data cov-\nerage with which to characterize the seabed morphology.\nThe results presented in this paper are based upon the analysis\nand interpretation of geophysical data acquired during a number of\nresearch cruises undertaken between 1990 and 1998 (syntax: cruise\nnumber\/year\u2014RRS Charles Darwin CD81\/93, R\/V Maurice Ewing\nEW9008\/90, RRS Charles Darwin CD87\/94 and RRS Discovery\nD235c\/98\u2014Parson 1993; Searle et al. 1994b; Sinha et al. 1994;\nPeirce & Sinha 1998, respectively). The bathymetry data from the\nfirst three of these forms the basis of the compilation by Keeton\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\n60 C. Peirce, A. Gardiner and M. Sinha\net al. (1997), while the corresponding magnetic data form the basis\nof the compilation of Lee & Searle (2000).\nBathymetry data is used to create an accurate representation of the\nseabed at sub-AVR scale, while sidescan sonar images of the ridge\naxis are used to characterize and identify the morphology of each\nAVR and thus identify its life cycle stage and relative age. Gravity\nmodelling, in both 2-D and 3-D, is used to investigate along-axis\ncrustal structure variations, while magnetic data are inverted in 3-D\nto obtain magnetization intensity variations and provide an indica-\ntion of the relative age of the extrusives. In addition, for each AVR\nstudied, the rate and symmetry of spreading is also investigated. The\nvarious stages in data compilation and processing are very briefly\noutlined below and fuller details can be found in the cited literature.\nIt must be noted that the results of modelling of these data sets\nis only significant to the scale of their individual resolutions. Con-\nsequently, the conclusions drawn in this paper relate mostly to the\ngeophysical perception of the oceanic crust and the larger-scale pro-\ncesses operating therein.\n3.1 Bathymetry data\nShipboard swath bathymetry data coverage of the Reykjanes Ridge\nencompasses the ridge axis and up to 50 km (5 Ma) off-axis from\n57\u25e630\u2032N to 62\u25e6N (see Fig. 2 inset for ship track coverage). For\nthis study, coverage was extended to 100 km (10 Ma) off-axis and\nholes in the swath coverage patched by incorporating data extracted\nfrom Sandwell & Smith\u2019s (1997) satellite data set. These data were\nmerged, smoothed and gridded\u2014see Keeton et al. (1997) for details.\nThe resulting ridge bathymetry data set is shown in Fig. 4(a).\nSouth of 59\u25e6N, the median valley topography characteristic of\nslow-spreading ridges predominates, while north of 59\u25e6N an ax-\nial rise more characteristic of intermediate- and faster-spreading\nridges exists. As this change in morphology is attributed to the in-\nfluence of the nearby Iceland hotspot, 59\u25e6N is regarded as marking\nthe southerly limit of direct hotspot\u2013ridge interaction (Sinha et al.\n1997, 1998; Peirce & Navin 2002). This assumption will be tested\nin Section 5.1.\n3.2 Gravity data\nThe ship-based gravity data set comprises 337 profiles spaced, on\naverage, 3.5\u20135 km along-axis and crossover analysis was performed\non each individual cruise data set to minimize cruise specific errors.\nProfiles from each contributing data set were then compared to en-\nsure a consistent datum level between cruises prior to merging. A\ncrossover analysis of the merged data was then performed prior to\ngridding to minimize the root-mean-square (rms) error for the entire\ndata set to \u00b11 mGal. The free-air anomaly (FAA) shown in Fig. 4(b)\nwas obtained by gridding with node parameters and footprint area\nmatching the bathymetry data, and with any off-axis gaps patched\nin the same manner.\nThe FAA pattern mirrors the ridge topography (Fig. 4a). As the\nseabed shoals heading northwards the axial anomaly increases from\n\u223c +10 mGal at 57\u25e625\u2032N to \u223c +65 mGal at 62\u25e6N. FAA values of less\nthan \u223c +40 mGal occur over the median valley with local minima\nof \u223c +20 mGal associated with inter-AVR basins, whereas the axial\nrise morphology of the ridge is characterized by a FAA mean value\nof \u223c +50 mGal with local maxima of \u223c +70 mGal associated with\nlarger AVRs. Prominent larger-scale features of the FAA are the\nV-shaped ridges (Vogt 1971; Ito 2001). These ridges are also evident\nin the bathymetry data set but to a far lesser degree (Fig. 4a), most\nprobably due to sediment cover (Jones et al. 2002).\nThe observed long-wavelength increase in FAA heading north-\nwards suggests that the elevated seabed topography associated with\nthe Iceland hotspot is not in complete isostatic equilibrium but in-\nstead may be partly supported dynamically by processes associated\nwith the plume in the mantle. This observation will be considered\nfurther in Section 5.\n3.3 Magnetic data\nThe magnetic anomaly compilation of Lee & Searle (2000) was sup-\nplemented with data acquired during D235c\/98 to complete cover-\nage along-axis from 57\u25e630\u2032N to 62\u25e630\u2032N and up to 100 km off-axis.\nThe combined magnetic anomaly is shown in Fig. 4(c).\n3.4 Seabed image data\nTwo areas of sidescan sonar data were acquired during EW9008\/90\n(see Fig. 2 for location) using the Towed Ocean-Bottom\nInstrument\u2014TOBI (Rouse 1991). One, TOBI area B, is located\nat the northern end of the ridge and one, TOBI area C, to the south.\nOnly AVRs in TOBI area C, extending from 31\u25e646\u2032W to 32\u25e647\u2032W\nand 57\u25e645\u2032N to 58\u25e627\u2032N (see Fig. 2) and south of the assumed max-\nimum extent of hotspot influence, were considered in terms of the\ncharacteristic features of axial lava flows, the degree and orienta-\ntion of faulting and individual AVR length. The interrelationship\nbetween adjacent AVRs was also considered. The average seafloor\ndepth in this region is \u223c1950 m and AVRs shallow by up to \u223c500 m\nabove the surrounding terrain. Median valley faults, 10\u201312 km apart\nwith seabed offsets of \u223c500 m, are prominent features that extend\nup to 30 km in length in a flip-flop fashion, that is, alternating from\none side of the ridge axis to the other, giving rise to asymmetric axial\ngraben in cross-section. An example collation of TOBIgrams from\nthe axial region between 57\u25e645\u2032N and 58\u25e627\u2032N is shown in Fig. 5.\n4 T O B I DATA I N T E R P R E TAT I O N\nAVRs identified in the TOBI data were initially interpreted in terms\nof their relative age by adopting the morphology vs. age definition of\nParson et al. (1993), which is based upon the following assumptions.\nThin AVRs associated with fissure-type volcanism are classified as\nyoung, and broader AVRs with conical seamounts are interpreted to\nbe slightly older and placed at the adolescent stage of the cycle. Ma-\nture AVRs have flat-topped seamounts and are generally periclinal in\nshape with a few AVR-parallel faults, whereas old AVRs are covered\nby a thin layer of sediment and are dissected by ridge-parallel faults.\nHowever, for this study this relative ageing scheme was extended to\nallow a finer scale of relative age subdivision whereby AVRs that fall\ninto the same age group (i.e. young, adolescent, mature or old) are\nseparated further by taking into account the abundance of sediment\ncover and the extent of faulting.\nThe RAMESSES AVR lies at the southernmost extremity of TOBI\narea C. It was chosen to provide a unique geophysical reference,\nsince its crust and upper mantle structure are well constrained by\nthe RAMESSES studies, allowing seabed features to be directly re-\nlated to underlying magmatic structures both in the crust and mantle\n(Sinha et al. 1997, 1998; MacGregor et al. 1998; Navin et al. 1998;\nHeinson et al. 2000).\nThe AVR numbering scheme of Keeton et al. (1997) was adopted\nfor this study. This defines the RAMESSES AVR, at 57\u25e645\u2032N, as\nAVR 1 with AVR numbers increasing incrementally northwards\nfrom this point.

These are: sediment\u2014to reflect areas of sedi-\nment cover; hummocky\u2014to reflect areas of larger pillow mounds or\naccumulations; hummocky (fine)\u2014to reflect areas of smaller pil-\nlow mounds or accumulations and smooth\u2014to reflect sheet-like\nflows.\n4.1 AVR 1 (RAMESSES)\nThis \u223c30 km long AVR centred on 57\u25e645\u2032N consists of a hum-\nmocky ridge with cratered conical and flat-topped volcanoes super-\nimposed. Bright backscatter around the edges of this AVR indicates\nthe presence of recent lava flows (Fig. 5). There is no clear evidence\nof faulting on the AVR itself but large AVR-parallel faults occur\nto its east, with similar smaller offset faults cutting off-axis hum-\nmocky terrain to the west. Little to no sediment cover is observed\non-axis. Combined interpretation of the RAMESSES results (Sinha\net al. 1998) suggests that this AVR is at the young to adolescent\nstage. However, its low magnetization, combined with a number of\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\n62 C. Peirce, A. Gardiner and M. Sinha\nlocal highs over small topographic features, led Lee & Searle (2000)\nto suggest that this AVR may be older and undergoing late-stage\nvolcanism. The long length of this AVR, its broad convex shape,\nand the presence of cratered conical and flat-topped volcanoes, sug-\ngest a more mature phase of the cycle and that the recent extrusive\nvolcanism is overprinting faulting on the AVR giving it a younger\nappearance.\n4.2 AVR 2\nThis relatively short AVR (\u223c10 km) near 57\u25e655\u2032N is composed\nmainly of pillow lava terrain with some flows that are sediment cov-\nered in places (Fig. 5). A large, faulted, flat-topped volcano can be\nseen at its southern end and an unfaulted, but heavily sedimented,\nflat-topped volcano at the northern end. Two short AVR-trending\nhummocky ridges lie at the northern end of this AVR, while nu-\nmerous small, ridge-trending faults overprint it entirely. The patchy\nsediment cover, extensive small-offset faulting and flat-topped vol-\ncanoes suggest that this AVR is at the very end adolescent to earliest\nmature phase of the cycle.\n4.3 AVR 4\nThe \u223c35-km-long hummocky edifice at 58\u25e605\u2032N contains one sed-\niment covered, flat-topped volcano located towards the southeast\n(Fig. 5). Faulting is more extensive than for AVR 2 and mainly fol-\nlows the ridge trend. Patchy sediment cover is visible on the edges of\nthe volcanic terrain. This AVR is the longest, and appears to be the\noldest, of the five AVRs studied and is probably at the early stages\nof the mature part of the cycle.\n4.4 AVR 6\nAt this 58\u25e615\u2032N-centred \u223c11-km-long AVR (Fig. 5) a degree of\nbright backscatter is observed around the edges, possibly indicating\nthe presence of fresh lava flows. The volcanic terrain is mainly\nhummocky in appearance with no point volcanoes observed. Ridge-\nparallel faulting is only observed off-axis to the west. This AVR is\nyounger in appearance than AVR 4, and is, most likely, at the young\nto adolescent stage of the cycle.\n4.5 AVR 7\nFresh lava flows are observed around the edges of this \u223c20 km\nlong hummocky AVR located at 58\u25e624\u2032N (Fig. 5). There is no clear\nevidence for on-axis faulting, although faulting is prevalent off-axis\nto the north. Patchy sediment cover on its edges suggests that this\nAVR is younger than AVR 4 but slightly older than AVR 6, probably\nat the adolescent part of its cycle.\n4.6 Summary of TOBI area C\nTOBI area C contains AVRs that are mainly adolescent to mature in\nage. AVRs are well defined with a number of conical and flat-topped\nvolcanoes observed. Faulting is ubiquitous off-axis but less preva-\nlent on-axis, where it is generally parallel to the AVR spreading-\northogonal trend.\nAVR morphology shows variation in the relative age and reveals a\ncorrelation between AVR age and length\u2014shorter AVRs appearing\nyounger than longer AVRs. An along-axis spatial wavelength of \u223c70\nkm is observed in the relative age pattern, with those younger and\nshorter being found to the north and south of the oldest and longest\nAVR (AVR 4). This pattern of AVR lengths and characteristics is\nalso observed in the bathymetry data to repeat along the ridge axis\nto the north, suggesting that AVRs are not randomly distributed\nalong-axis, but that some underlying process controls not only\ntheir emplacement but the initiation of the tectono-magmatic cycle\nitself.\nHowever, the four distinct stages of the cycle proposed by Parson\net al. (1993) do not adequately explain all the morphological obser-\nvations. For example, AVRs are observed that have characteristics\nof two stages, for example, adolescent and mature. Therefore, the\nyoung\u2013adolescent\u2013mature-old stages merely reflect snapshots in a\ncontinuous life cycle, whereby an AVR gradually evolves from one\nstage to the next, incorporating features characteristic of each stage\nin the transition process.\nThe existence of a symmetrical and systematic along-axis age\npattern implies that melt is not supplied to each AVR independently\nfrom the mantle in some random or chaotic manner, but is instead\nmore centrally focused within an \u223c70 km lateral distance encom-\npassing multiple AVRs.\n5 G R AV I T Y M O D E L L I N G\nThe hypothesis that the relative age of AVRs should be reflected in\ntheir crustal structure can be tested. Having established a relative\nAVR age chronology, the crustal structure of each AVR may be\nmodelled from gravity data, using the RAMSSES AVR to constrain\nand ground-truth this modelling process.\nBefore modelling the shorter-wavelength (\u223c10 km) gravity\nanomalies associated with individual AVRs, the longer-wavelength\nalong-ridge anomaly, or \u2018regional\u2019 field, must first be character-\nized to determine the nature and extent of Iceland hotspot influence\nand confirm the underlying assumption that 59\u25e6N marks the south-\nernmost boundary of hotspot influence. Consequently, an average\nlayered crustal model may be developed for the axial region and\nthe residual mantle Bouguer anomaly calculated. By correlating the\nvariation in residual mantle Bouguer anomaly between AVRs, the\nshorter-wavelength (in geophysical terms) variation in crustal struc-\nture may be considered in the context of AVR morphology and rel-\native age.\n5.1 Along-axis FAA\u2014hotspot-related crustal structure\nAn \u223c650-km-long profile was extracted from the FAA compilation\nand modelled using gravmag (British Geological Survey\u2014Pedley\net al. 1993). A three-layer (sea water, crust, mantle) approach was\nadopted since the along-axis variation in layer 2A and 2B thickness\nand density primarily results in only shorter-wavelength (<10 km)\ngravity anomalies, which are assumed to largely correlate with layer\n2 variation only.\nInitial crustal layer densities were obtained from the RAMESSES\ngravity models (Navin et al. 1998) and are summarized in Table 1\n(see also Nafe & Drake 1957, 1962; Carlson & Raskin 1984).\nThroughout this paper densities are quoted in g cm\u22123 for brevity\nof annotation on figures\u20141 g cm\u22123 is equivalent to 1000 kg m\u22123.\nModelling was also constrained using all available zero-age crustal\nthickness determinations from the Reykjanes Ridge as a whole\n(\u00b1 1.0 km in all cases) of 7.5 km, 8.0 km and 10.0 km obtained\nfrom seismic models at 57\u25e645\u2032N, 59\u25e630\u2032N and 61\u25e640\u2032N respectively\n(Bunch & Kennett 1980; Smallwood et al. 1995; Navin et al. 1998,\nrespectively and see Fig. 6).\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\nTemporal and spatial cyclicity of accretion at slow-spreading ridges 63\nTable 1.

The mantle is represented by a\ndensity of 3.30 g cm\u22123, common to many ridge gravity studies (e.g. Kuo & Forsyth 1988; Cormier et al. 1995). The\nmain difference between the two methods of Carlson & Raskin (1984) is that method 3 attempts to take into account\nthe large-scale porosity encountered in oceanic layer 2A.\nNafe & Drake Carlson & Raskin Navin et al. 3-layer initial\n(1957) (1984) (1998) model\nVp \u03c1nd \u03c1m2 \u03c1m3 Av\u03c1\n(km s\u22121) (g cm\u22123) (g cm\u22123) (g cm\u22123) (g cm\u22123) (g cm\u22123) (g cm\u22123)\nwater 1.49 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1.03 1.03 1.03\nsediments 2.60 2.10 1.51 2.04 1.89 1.60\nlayer 2A\/B 5.00 2.54 2.61 2.74 2.63 2.40\/2.53 2.75\nlayer 3 6.75 2.89 2.92 2.94 2.92 2.85\nmantle 8.00 3.26 3.06 3.03 3.11 3.30 3.30\nApart from seabed topography, which contributes significantly to the\nobserved field, there are a number of potential causes of variation\nof the observed FAA:\n(1) crustal thickness variation;\n(2) density variation in the crust;\n(3) density variation in the upper mantle and\n(4) any combination of any of the aforementioned causes.\nOnly variations in crustal thickness (Fig. 6b), upper mantle den-\nsity (Fig. 6c) and a combination of crustal thickness and upper man-\ntle densities (Fig. 6d) are considered, as seismic observations suggest\nthat these are the most likely manifestation of the longer-wavelength\neffects of the Iceland hotspot on the along-axis structure of the ridge\nas a whole. Variations in density within the crust along-axis are gen-\nerally shown to be the source of the shorter-wavelength anomalies,\nwhich reflect the pattern of segmentation or morphological variation\nat a subsegment level.\nStarting with the simplest case, if a constant crust and upper man-\ntle density are assumed (Fig. 6b) then solely an increase in crustal\nthickness from 7.0 km at 57\u25e645\u2032N to \u223c11.5 km at 61\u25e640\u2032N, results in\nan anomaly fit. However, this model does not fit the seismic crustal\nthickness determinations of Bunch & Kennett (1980) at 59\u25e630\u2032N\nnor, if extended further north, the estimate of Weir et al. (2001) near\n62\u25e640\u2032N.\nSimilarly, assuming a constant crustal density and thickness, a\ndecrease in upper mantle density from 3.30 g cm\u22123 at 57\u25e645\u2032N to\n3.14 g cm\u22123 near 62\u25e6N (Fig. 6c), also fits the observed anomaly.\nThis model, when extrapolated further north, is not compatible with\nthe observations of Weir et al. (2001) both in terms of overall crustal\nthickness and upper mantle density, 11.0 km and 3.23 g cm\u22123, re-\nspectively, at 62\u25e640\u2032N.\nThe preferred model, presented in Fig. 6(d), provides a good fit\nto the observed FAA and all available crustal thickness and up-\nper mantle density determinations. The generally quoted normal\noceanic crustal thickness of 7.1 \u00b1 0.8 km of White et al. (1992)\n(dashed lines in Figs 6b\u2013d) is only exceeded north of 59\u25e6N, which\nsuggests that crustal thickness in TOBI area C is not significantly\ninfluenced by the Iceland hotspot.\nNote that the shorter-wavelength (\u223c10 km) free-air anomalies\nare not adequately modelled (within seismic constraints) indicating\nthat, as already proposed, smaller-scale along-axis variations in in-\ntracrustal layer thickness, and probably density, are the prominent\nsource of these observed anomalies.\nAlthough the preferred model is rather simplistic it does allow a\nnumber of conclusions to be drawn. Firstly, the AVRs which com-\nprise TOBI area C lie at, or beyond, the limit of any significant\nhotspot influence on crustal thickness. Consequently their accre-\ntionary processes and magma supply are unlikely to be affected by\nany significant increase in melt generation rates or thermal flux as-\nsociated with the hotspot. As observed in Section 3.2 (Fig. 4b), the\nFAA increases in value heading northwards towards Iceland, which\nsuggests that the elevated topographic bulge associated with the Ice-\nland hotspot is not in complete isostatic equilibrium. This modelling\nsuggests that the bulge is partly isostatically compensated both by\na decrease in mantle density and by an increase in crustal thickness\nheading towards the hotspot centre, but that dynamic forces associ-\nated with the underlying plume must also contribute to the overall\ntopographic signature of the hotspot.\n5.2 Along-axis residual mantle Bouguer\nanomaly\u2014AVR-related crustal structure\nTo determine the variation in crustal thickness and density associ-\nated with individual AVRs and to investigate whether AVRs in their\nmagmatic phase are also related to density anomalies in the crust\nand mantle associated with melt ascent and its accumulation within\nthe crust, the mantle and residual mantle Bouguer anomalies (MBA\nand RMBA, respectively) were calculated. The MBA is equivalent\nto the FAA corrected for the 3-D effect of seabed topography as-\nsuming a constant density and thickness layered crustal structure\nmodel (Prince & Forsyth 1988). The MBA thus reveals any anoma-\nlous density regions or variations in crustal layer thickness relative\nto that model. The RMBA is the result of further correcting for\nthermal-related density changes in the mantle due to passive mantle\nupwelling at the ridge axis and subsequent plate cooling (Phipps\nMorgan & Forsyth 1988, after Forsyth & Wilson 1984). The MBA\nand RMBA are more appropriate than the FAA for studying in-\ndividual AVRs and their interrelationships, since the gravitational\neffects of the density contrast across the sea water\u2013seabed interface\n(which contributes \u223c70 per cent to the total field and hence masks\nthe smaller-scale anomalies associated with the variation in crust\nand mantle properties of interest here) are fully accounted for.\nThe simple crustal model used to calculate the MBA consists of\nconstant thickness and density layers\u2014set in the context of the geo-\nphysical definition of oceanic layers 2A, 2B and 3\u2014and a constant\ndensity mantle draped beneath the seafloor topography (see Fig. 7\nand Table 2 for details). Layers 2A and 2B are included in this model\nbecause their across-axis variation would be expected to contribute\nsignificantly to the gravity anomaly at the AVR scale.

The resulting\nMBA is shown in Fig. 8(a).\nThe MBA amplitude on-axis (Fig. 8a) follows a linear trend head-\ning northwards from \u223c45 mGal at 57\u25e625\u2032N to \u221210 mGal at 62\u25e6N,\nan along-axis gradient of 0.095 mGal km\u22121, with peak-to-trough\namplitudes of 1\u201310 mGal. A number of AVRs display the \u2018bull\u2019s\neye\u2019 pattern, with anomaly lows at segment centres, similar to those\nobserved elsewhere on the MAR (e.g. Kuo & Forsyth 1988; Lin\net al. 1990; Tolstoy et al. 1993; Detrick et al. 1995), although their\namplitudes are much smaller. The local anomaly highs over the\ninter-AVR basins suggest the presence of thinner crust (Searle et al.\n1994a). The general northwards decrease in anomaly supports the\nconclusion that the crust thickens and\/or mantle densities decrease\ntowards Iceland relative to the crustal model used to calculate the\nMBA (cf . Fig. 6d). The small along-axis gradient and low \u2018bull\u2019s\neye\u2019 anomaly amplitudes suggest that the strong 3-D pattern of up-\nwelling that is observed at other slow-spreading ridges is subdued\nat the scale of individual AVRs at the Reykjanes Ridge, resulting in\nan MBA pattern more akin to faster-spreading ridges (Lin & Phipps\nMorgan 1992; Cormier et al. 1995; Magde et al. 1995). The MBA\nalso follows the ridge trend rather than the AVR trend. In addition,\nthe lack of prominent \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019 lows associated with individual\nAVRs and the observed longer-wavelength ridge-parallel anomaly,\nwhich encompasses several adjacent AVRs, suggests that the seg-\nmentation pattern associated with melt supply may also be operating\nover a larger length-scale than that of individual AVRs\u2014that is, that\na segment here comprises several AVRs.\nTo calculate the RMBA, the thermal effect of passive upwelling\nat the ridge (Phipps Morgan & Forsyth 1988) is subtracted from\nthe MBA (Fig. 8b). The change in ridge trend near 59\u25e6N (Fleischer\n1974) and the individual AVRs were accommodated by subdividing\nthe ridge into a series of short segments each offset by transforms.\nAlthough transform offsets do not exist between AVRs in reality,\nthe short offset distances involved in this assumption do not con-\ntribute significantly to the resulting anomaly pattern, and thus this\nrepresentation is considered to be acceptable within errors.\nThe RMBA (Fig. 8c) still shows a decrease in anomaly am-\nplitude towards Iceland and the \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019 lows associated with\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\nTemporal and spatial cyclicity of accretion at slow-spreading ridges 65\nTable 2.

The next \u2018bull\u2019s eye\u2019\nlow of \u22124 mGal, occurs over AVR 4. Anomalies then generally\ndecrease in amplitude, culminating with a small \u22123 mGal low over\nAVR 7. Off-axis traces of RMBA lows over AVRs 1, 2, 4 and 6\nare asymmetric, suggesting variations in relative crustal structure\non either side of the ridge axis. These observations are interpreted\nto reflect asymmetry in the crustal accretion process itself, and this\ninterpretation will be tested by calculating local spreading rates in\nSection 7.\n6 T E C T O N O - M A G M AT I C C YC L E S A N D\nC RU S TA L S T RU C T U R E O F AV R S\nIf crustal structure is intimately related to melt supply, AVRs ageing\nthrough the magmatic phase of their life cycle should have a corre-\nspondingly thicker crust and\/or lower density within the crust when\ncompared with those either undergoing tectonic extension or at the\nbeginning of their life cycle. To investigate if such a correlation be-\ntween crustal structure and AVR age exists, the shorter-wavelength\nAVR RMBAs were modelled in 2-D (Fig. 10). Although the crustal\nstructure of an AVR is unlikely to be 2-D, the 2-D assumption is valid\nfor mid-crustal features with a half-strike length greater than 5 km\n(Gardiner 2003) largely because the RMBA calculation removes the\naffect of the seabed topography, which accounts for \u223c70 per cent of\nthe gravity anomaly and represents by far the majority of the in- and\nout-of-plane variability. A four-layer model (Fig. 11), based on the\nRAMESSES model of Navin et al. (1998) and consisting of oceanic\nlayers 2A, 2B, 3 and the upper mantle, was used as an initial starting\npoint for all AVRs.\n6.1 AVR 1 (RAMESSES)\nThe crustal structure models for AVR 1 (Fig. 11) are taken from\nPeirce & Navin (2002) and are included for purposes of comparison\nand ground-truthing with models for the other AVRs presented here,\nwhich are based solely on gravity modelling. Peirce & Navin (2002)\ninterpret the low-density region in layer 3 as containing a high per-\ncentage of partial melt, with the lowest density block, off-centre\nbut beneath the shallowest topography, representing the region of\nmost recent melt influx. This conclusion is supported by MacGregor\net al.\u2019s (1998) analysis of coincident CSEM data which suggests up\nto 20\u201340 per cent melt may be present. Note that an \u223c100-m-thin\nmelt lens, identified by the seismic modelling of Navin et al. (1998),\nhas been included in the AVR 1 gravity models for completeness\nonly as it does not give rise to a significant gravity anomaly within\nthe resolution of the data.\n6.2 AVR 2\nThe along-axis RMBA (Fig. 12) has no distinct low associated with\nthe segment centre, instead small fluctuations of \u223c1mGal on a\n\u223c5 km length scale occur around a 1 mGal background average.\nA simple crustal structure with constant densities and thinning of\n\u223c200 m (Fig. 12c) results in an acceptable fit, while a mid-\nlower crustal density distribution such as that modelled for AVR\n1 (Fig. 12d) produces a large misfit (\u223c5 mGal). The best fit is\nachieved with small variations in layer 2 thickness (200\u2013400 m)\nand no crustal thinning (Fig. 12e). A \u22121 mGal RMBA low, slightly\noff-axis to the southwest of this AVR (see Fig. 10), may indicate its\ncontinued growth\/rejuvenation via off-axis melt migration, or that\na new influx of melt to the crust is leading to the initiation of a new\nAVR.\n6.3 AVR 4\nThis AVR has longer-wavelength RMBA variations (\u223c10 km) sim-\nilar to that of AVR 1 but the anomaly amplitude only reaches a\nrelative \u22124 mGal low at the segment centre (Fig. 13). Small varia-\ntions in layer 2 thickness, in a crustal structure with no mid-lower\ncrustal density variations and no crustal thinning (Fig. 13b), match\nthe shorter-wavelength features of the RMBA only. Combining vari-\nations in layer 2 thickness with crustal thinning of \u223c400 m towards\nthe segment ends (Fig. 13c) produces a better overall fit, but in-\ncluding the mid-lower crustal densities of AVR 1 into the model\n(Fig. 13d) results in a 3 mGal misfit. However, reducing the den-\nsities in the mid-lower crust beneath the segment centre by only\n0.01\u20130.03 g cm\u22123 (Fig. 13e) produces the best fit and would indi-\ncate the presence of 5\u201315 per cent retained melt (Hooft & Detrick\n1993).

Models with: variations in layer 2 thickness of up to 500 m\n(Fig. 14b), crustal thinning of \u223c1 km to the south and of \u223c500 m\nto the north of the segment centre (Fig. 14c), or a 0.03\u20130.04 g cm\u22123\ndensity anomaly (15\u201320 per cent partial melt) in layer 3 beneath\nthe segment centre (Fig. 14e) all produce an acceptable fit. Density\nanomalies in the mid-lower crust similar to those modelled for AVR\n1 (cf. Fig. 11e and Fig. 14d) produce a 5 mGal misfit (Fig. 14d). A\ncrustal model suggesting more partial melt in the crust than AVR\n4 (Fig. 13e) is consistent with the young to adolescent age of this\nAVR and also, more significantly, that an influx of melt may have\noccurred relatively recently.\n6.5 AVR 7\nThis AVR has short-wavelength RMBA variations of \u223c5 km and\nonly reaches a \u22123 mGal low over the segment centre (Fig. 15). The\nalong-axis crustal structure can be modelled in several ways that all\nproduce acceptable fits to the RMBA: a slightly thicker (\u223c500 m)\nlayer 2 beneath the segment centre (Fig. 15b), crustal thinning of\n\u223c1 km towards the ends of the profile, with smaller variations in\nlayer 2 thickness (Fig. 15c), or more subdued variations in crustal\nand layer 2 thickness with a 0.01\u20130.02 g cm\u22123density anomaly,\nequivalent to 5\u201310 per cent retained melt, in the mid-lower crust\nbeneath the segment centre (Fig. 15e). Fig. 15(d) shows that mid-\nlower crustal densities as low as that modelled for AVR 1 would\nproduce a significant misfit. A model with less partial melt in the\ncrust than AVR 6 is consistent with its interpreted adolescent age.\n6.6 Layer 2A and 2B density variations\nAll of the along-axis AVR models have layers 2A and 2B with den-\nsities of 2.40 g cm\u22123, in common with the RAMESSES model of\nNavin et al.

In\nfact, if layer 2B density is 2.53 g cm\u22123 its thickness would have to be\nhalved to produce an acceptable fit. Introducing a gradational change\n(Fig. 16d), from 2.40 g cm\u22123 at the AVR centre to 2.53 g cm\u22123 at\nthe AVR extremities, slightly improves the fit at the northern end of\nthe AVR but does not fit the whole profile unless significant varia-\nFigure 12.

However, the fit for the rest of the profile\nis not within the error bounds.\nThus, this layer 2A and 2B density variation sensitivity modelling\nprecludes large variations in density without having to significantly\nalter the seismically constrained layer thicknesses as well. However,\nsubtle layer 2A and 2B density variations of \u223c0.05 g cm\u22123 are not\nprecluded but these cannot account for the AVR-centred RMBA\nlows alone.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\n68 C.

However, another possible source of the RMBA lows are\nmantle density variations due to melt retention, thermal expansion\nand compositional changes caused by the extraction of partial melt\n(although compositional density reductions in the mantle are un-\nlikely to contribute significantly to the observed gravity anomaly\u2014\nMagde et al. 1995). Although the 2-D modelling presented here\ncannot differentiate between the different possible sources of low\ndensity in the upper mantle it can help constrain possible models\nfor mantle plumbing, that is, how the melt ascends from the source\nregion in the mantle to the crust.\nFigure 14. Along-axis RMBA profile for AVR 6. See Fig. 11 for details. The\nRMBA can be matched by variations in layer 2 thickness alone, variations in\ncrustal thickness, or by a low-density region in the mid-crust together with\ncrustal thinning towards the AVR tips.\nTo investigate possible models of mantle plumbing AVR 4 was\nselected as it is associated with an RMBA low and crustal modelling\nsuggests that only a small density anomaly in layer 3 is required to\nexplain it. To test if this low can equally be explained by density\nvariation in the mantle, the crustal model of AVR 4 (Fig. 13c) was\nused as a starting point, with the upper mantle extended to 80-km-\ndepth bsl and a region of lower densities incorporated beneath the\nAVR centre to investigate different conduit geometries and melt\nretention models. Density anomalies were converted to percentages\nof retained melt assuming a density contrast of 0.5 g cm\u22123 between\nbasaltic melt and peridotite (Sparks et al. 1993). Modelling shows\nthat a mantle model with an \u223c10 km wide conduit extending to\na depth of 80 km bsl, with more than 4\u20138 per cent retained melt,\nresults in a significant misfit (Fig. 17a).

Modelling is also consis-\ntent with highly episodic melt extraction from the upper mantle and\nits influx to the crust (MacGregor et al. 1998; Navin et al. 1998;\nHeinson et al. 2000; Peirce & Navin 2002) since the mantle beneath\nthe RAMESSES AVR is observed to currently contain less partial\nmelt than the crustal magmatic system.

Gravity modelling shows\nthat a number of these lows can be explained by up to a 1 km thick-\nening of the crust and\/or by the presence of low-density regions\nin the mid-lower crust (see Table 3). Models of crustal structure,\nshowing crustal thickening beneath older and the presence of par-\ntial melt beneath younger AVRs, are consistent with the identified\nstage of each AVR in the tectono-magmatic cycle. Younger AVRs\nare undergoing magmatic activity with more melt in the mid-lower\ncrust than mature AVRs which have reached full crustal thickness\nand are at the end of their magmatic phase.\nAVR 1 is anomalous in that the RAMESSES results indicate it\nhas partial melt within the crust (Navin et al. 1998), whereas its long\nlength and mature age suggest it should be reaching the end of its\nmagmatic phase with little partial melt remaining. If the hypothesis\nthat tectono-magmatic cycles affect the crustal structure of AVRs is\ncorrect, then a likely explanation is that it is undergoing late stage\nrejuvenation. AVR 2, at \u223c10 km in length, is unusually short for its\napparent age (adolescent\u2013mature). However, an RMBA low off-axis\nto the west could indicate that its growth is continuing via off-axis\nmelt migration or that the growth of a new AVR has diverted melt\nflux from it.\nThe gravity models presented in this section support the theory\nthat tectono-magmatic cycles influence the crustal structure of indi-\nvidual AVRs. In addition, a ridge-trending RMBA low is observed,\nsuggesting that upwelling occurs in this orientation but that melt mi-\ngrates laterally filling spreading-normal fissures orientated oblique\nto the ridge direction and forming AVRs (Peirce & Navin 2002).\nAVRs appear to young and become shorter towards second-order\ndiscontinuities, suggesting that AVR growth is initially focussed at\nthe centre of the upwelling and that crustal production gradually\nextends to the segment extremities.\n7 M A G N E T I C A N O M A LY I N V E R S I O N\nA N D S P R E A D I N G R AT E\nC A L C U L AT I O N S\nA decrease in magnetization intensity with age, attributed to low-\ntemperature oxidation of titanomagnetite, has been observed at all\nsampled ridges (e.g. Talwani et al. 1971; Johnson & Atwater 1977;\nLowrie 1977; Macdonald 1977; Johnson & Hall 1978) with a factor\nof five reduction in the natural remanent magnetization over the first\n0.5 Myr (Johnson et al. 1996). Variations in intensity across- and\nalong-axis may, therefore, provide a useful constraint on the relative\ntiming of crustal accretionary processes and allow investigation of\nasymmetry in spreading that is suggested by the RMBA. Primarily,\nmagnetization intensities will be used to test the relative age of AVRs\nand to calculate their local spreading rates to determine whether a\ncorrelation exists between relative AVR age and local spreading\nrate. The latter will also be used as a test of the interpretation of the\nRMBA that spreading may be asymmetric.\nThe magnetic (Fig. 4c) and bathymetry data (Fig. 4a\u2014Keeton\net al. 1997) were used to calculate crustal magnetization variations\nusing the 3-D inversion method of Parker & Huestis (1974) and Mac-\ndonald et al. (1980). Lee & Searle (2000) contains a detailed descrip-\ntion of the inversion procedure and the parameters used. Modelling\nof the calculated magnetization solution reproduces the observed\nmagnetic anomalies to within 1.9 nT rms, indicating that the mag-\nnetization intensity solution (Figs 8d and 18) can explain 99.95 per\ncent of the variance in the magnetic anomaly.\n7.1 Along-axis\u2014relative AVR age\nThe highest intensities in the calculated magnetization (Fig. 18) oc-\ncur along the ridge axis and range from 30 A m\u22121 to 75 A m\u22121.

A magnetization high indicates ei-\nther the presence of fresher extrusives, more fractionated basalts, a\nthicker magnetic source layer, or a combination of these different\nfactors.\nAVR 1 has the lowest, on-axis average magnetization intensity\nof \u223c35 A m\u22121 for the entire area (Fig. 18). A local magnetization\nintensity high of 65 A m\u22121 is associated with AVR 2, and the in-\ntensities then decrease along-axis to \u223c50 A m\u22121 for AVR 4. The\nintensity magnitude then increases gradually again to 65 A m\u22121 for\nAVR 6. This pattern of a high over a short AVR, decreasing to a low\nover a longer AVR, increasing again to a high over a shorter AVR,\ncan be seen further to the north as well.\nLee & Searle (2000) show that no more than 50 per cent of the ob-\nserved short-wavelength anomaly can be attributed to on-axis layer\n2A thickness variations (see also Smallwood et al. 1995; Navin et al.\n1998; Topping 2002). As oxidation of titanomagnetite results in de-\ncay of magnetization intensities with age, the shorter-wavelength\nanomalies can be assumed to reflect local age variations of the extru-\nsive layer. The low magnetization intensity of AVR 1 is unexpected\ngiven its relatively young age, although it is consistent with the al-\nternative suggestion that this AVR may be undergoing rejuvenation\nthrough late-stage volcanism. A number of small, local magnetiza-\ntion intensity highs associated with small volcanic features along\nthe AVR further support this interpretation.\nAnother, perhaps simpler, explanation for this observation may\nbe that the highs and lows reflect fractionation trends\u2014with lows\nreflecting AVRs which erupt relatively less fractionated basalts and\nthe highs corresponding to more fractionated basalts (e.g. Carbotte\n& Macdonald 1992). Fractionation of basaltic melts results in pref-\nerential enrichment of iron and titanium in the melt fraction at the\nexpense of the solid phase, and so can lead to the eruption of lavas\nwhich, on cooling, take on stronger remnant and induced magneti-\nzations. Other explanations include the possibility that the magma\nbody beneath AVR 1 is sufficiently large for mixing to effectively\ninhibit fractionation, resulting in unusually low magnetization in-\ntensity basalts or that they were erupted before much fractionation\nhas occurred. Alternatively, hydrothermal activity may have altered\nthe chemical composition of the basalts and reduced the average\nmagnetization intensity. However, German et al. (1994), after ex-\ntensive surveying along the entire length of the Reykjanes Ridge,\nfound no evidence for extensive hydrothermal activity, except for\none location, Steinaho\u00b4ll, near the Icelandic coast.\nWith the exception of AVR 1, a correlation between relative AVR\nage and average magnetization is observed. Shorter, younger AVRs\nare associated with magnetization intensity highs, whereas longer,\nolder AVRs exhibit relative lows. The spatial pattern of anomalies,\nwith a gradual increase in magnetization intensity associated with\nyounger, shorter AVRs to the north and south from an older, longer\ncentral AVR, supports the suggestion from the TOBI data (Section\n4.6) and the gravity modelling (Section 6.8), that a single second-\norder segment may comprise several AVRs and be of the order of\n\u223c70 km long. This is typical of slow-spreading ridge segments and\nparticularly those of the MAR. In addition, joint consideration of\nthe RMBA, bathymetry (AVR length) and magnetic intensity for\nthe entire ridge axis (e.g. Figs 4 and 8), suggests that this variation\nrepeats at approximately the same interval along its length.\n7.2 Across-axis\u2014spreading rate variations\nAcross-axis variation in magnetization intensity, when correlated\nwith a reversal timescale, can be used to calculate spreading rate.\nVariations in this rate with time may relate to the stage of the AVR in\na tectono-magmatic cycle and to the nature of the dominant tectonic\nprocess. Tectono-magmatic cycles have been shown in this study to\nhave an effect on the crustal structure of AVRs and it is further hy-\npothesized that the intense magmatic activity associated with AVRs\nin the young\u2013adolescent phase of the cycle may also be reflected\nin an enhanced local spreading rate relative to old AVRs that are\nsimply being dismembered by tectonic processes.\nSpreading rates were calculated for profiles orientated in the\nspreading direction (Fig. 18), using the reversal timescale of Cande\n& Kent (1995). The slow spreading rate of the Reykjanes Ridge\nmeans that the Jaramillo epoch (1.03 Ma) is quite narrow. Half-\nspreading rate calculations were, therefore, made for each AVR\nfrom zero-age to the more prominent reversals at 1.42 Ma between\nJaramillo and chron 2 (1.86 Ma) and to chron 2A at 2.81 Ma. Results\nare shown in Fig. 18 and summarized in Table 4.\nIn general, longer, older AVRs have slower spreading rates (by up\nto 20 per cent), for the first 1.42 Ma, than AVRs that are shorter and\nyounger. However, spreading rates for all AVRs, averaged over 2.81\nMa, show little variation within the\u00b11.0 mm yr\u22121 error bound. Older\nAVRs are therefore, simply rafted off-axis at the far-field spreading\nrate, whereas crustal genesis at younger AVRs enhances the local\nspreading rate before returning to a \u2018background\u2019 level as magma\ninflux wanes. Similar non-rigid plate tectonic behaviour on short\ntimescales has been reported at 37\u25e6N on the MAR (e.g. Macdonald\n1977) and at \u223c9\u25e6N on the EPR (Carbotte & Macdonald 1992),\nsuggesting that independent cycles of magmatic and tectonic activity\noccur within adjacent segments at all spreading rates. Although these\nvariations are comparable to the error bounds, they are considered\nsignificant and supportable given that they mirror both the findings\nof the TOBI interpretation and gravity modelling.\nSpreading rates calculated for the last 1.42 Ma also exhibit\nasymmetry between the two ridge flanks.

Correlation between AVR age, length, magnetization intensity and local half-spreading rate across individual AVRs. Longer,\nolder AVRs are generally associated with a magnetization intensity low, whereas shorter, younger AVRs have magnetization highs,\nconfirming the relative age TOBI interpretation. Note that before 1.42 Ma, younger AVRs have higher average spreading rates than older\nAVRs. However, when averaged over the last 2.81 Ma, spreading rates converge to the average spreading rate for the entire ridge of \u223c10\nmm yr\u22121. Significant asymmetric spreading rates are shown in bold.

Spreading\nappears to be faster to the east of AVRs 1, 2, 6 and 7 (see Table 4).\nAlthough the evidence for asymmetric spreading lies predominantly\nin the RMBA (see Section 5.2), with RMBA lows located in the\ndirection of slower spreading, those results are supported by the\napparent asymmetry in spreading rate even though variation in the\nlatter are comparable to the error bounds. This pattern suggests,\nassuming off-axis RMBA lows primarily reflect the presence of\nthicker crust (though crustal and\/or mantle density variations may\ncontribute), that differential tectonic extension \u2018stretches\u2019 material\naccreting to the plate boundary more in one direction than the other.\nThis hypothesis would be supported by evidence for asymmetric\nfaulting, with more faults and\/or greater vertical fault offsets to the\neast within TOBI area C. In fact, although \u2018flip-flop\u2019 style faulting is\nobserved in this area no overall segment-scale asymmetry is obvious\nand large offsets would be required as the fault scarps are steep\n(Owens 1991). Alternatively, asymmetry in the crustal accretion\nprocess itself may occur, with dykes intruding preferentially to one\nside of the plate boundary than the other (Macdonald 1977). For\nexample, if a recent intrusion at the ridge axis has sufficient time to\ncool, the crust at this location may be sufficiently strong such that the\nnext intrusion may preferentially occur somewhere off-axis, along\nactive planes of weakness. The episodic nature of crustal accretion\nat the Reykjanes Ridge (Navin et al. 1998; Sinha et al. 1998) may,\ntherefore, also sustain asymmetric spreading.\n8 D I S C U S S I O N\nGravity and seismic studies suggest differences in mantle upwelling\npatterns between slow- and fast-spreading ridges (e.g. Kuo &\nForsyth 1988; Lin et al. 1990; Detrick et al. 1995; Magde et al.\n1995). At slow spreading rates mantle upwelling is thought to be\n3-D, with a buoyant diapiric style leading to the formation of small,\nisolated and ephemeral magma chambers which, in turn, result in\nthe significant variations observed in along-axis crustal structure. At\nfast-spreading rates, however, 2-D upwelling associated with plate\nseparation dominates. The latter sheet-like pattern of melt delivery\nresults in magma chambers that are largely continuous along the seg-\nment length, and in relatively little along-axis variation in crustal\nstructure at the resolution of geophysical imaging. Thus, morpho-\nlogical segmentation at both slow- and fast-spreading ridges can be\nused as a proxy for the underlying pattern of mantle upwelling and\nthe along-axis extent of individual magma bodies.\nHowever, more recent studies are starting to provide evidence\nof significant temporal and lateral variability in crustal accretionary\nprocesses, and suggest that patterns of alternating phases of tectonic\nand magmatic activity occur at all spreading rates. Some examples\ninclude:\n(1) Sauter et al. (2002) interpreted TOBI sidescan sonar data\ncollected between 58\u25e620\u2032E and 60\u25e620\u2032E at the very slow-spreading\nSouthwest Indian Ridge (16 mm yr\u22121 full rate) to show that either\nmultiple magma sources exist or that magma is redistributed along-\naxis through lateral dyke injection.\n(2) Lawson et al. (1996) interpreted extensive TOBI, deep-towed\ncamera and geochemical data from two segments in the MARNOK\narea (Mid-Atlantic Ridge North of Kane) to show that variations in\napparent age between and within adjacent segments may be due to\nthe episodicity of magma supply and the along-axis migration of\nmelt, respectively.\n(3) Sohn et al. (1997) interpreted data from a 3-D tomography\nexperiment over the intermediate-spreading (60 mm yr\u22121) Co-axial\nsegment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to show that the along-axis\nvelocity structure indicates a shift from magmatic to amagmatic\nextension and reflects variations in magma supply along-axis.\n(4) Karson et al. (2002) suggest that variations in the thickness\nof lava and dyke units along the Hess Deep, adjacent to the fast-\nspreading EPR, reflect temporal fluctuations in magma supply, while\nStewart et al. (2002) analysed samples collected along a \u223c25 km\n(370 000 yr) transect through the same area and showed that the high\nvariability in magma composition observed over short distances and\ntime periods results from multiple injections of melt into the crust\nrather than having an origin in a single, well-mixed magma reservoir.\n(5) Wright et al.\u2019s (2002) sidescan sonar study at 17\u25e615\u2032S on\nthe EPR shows a good correlation between along-axis variation in\nfissure density and the relative age of lava flows, and with older lavas\nassociated with increased fissure density. They also conclude that\nthe structure of fast-spreading ridges is related to episodic cycles\nof magmatic and tectonic processes within second- to fourth-order\nsegments, with dyke propagation along-axis a significant factor.\n(6) White et al.\u2019s (2002) observations of lava flow morphology\nand tectonic features at 9\u25e6\u201310\u25e6N on the EPR indicate that each\nthird-order segment behaves as a single volcanic system with higher\neffusion rates near segment centres.\n(7) Hilton et al. (1993) analysed lavas dredged from the Cen-\ntral Valu Fa Ridge in the Lau Basin and showed that their along-\naxis compositional and geochemical variations imply that this ridge\nsegment is supplied by a number of separate magmatic systems.\nCollier & Sinha (1992) showed that the same ridge segment can be\ndivided into three fourth-order segments based upon their bathymet-\nric, morphological and magmatic characteristics, whose differences\nthey attribute to cyclic magma supply and tectonic extension on\nthe fourth-order segment length-scale and that each segment is at a\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\n74 C. Peirce, A. Gardiner and M. Sinha\ndifferent phase in this cycle. Turner et al. (1999) and Day et al.\n(2001) showed that this pattern of segmentation and laterally vari-\nable melt supply is also mirrored in the along-axis velocity structure\nof layer 3, and Peirce et al. (2001) the along-axis gravity field.\nCyclic accretion therefore operates at all spreading rates, with the\ntime frame of magma supply to the crust, the along-axis redistribu-\ntion of melt and tectonic extension being the most likely cause of\nthe observed morphological differences.\nHowever, most work to date has focused mainly on seabed mor-\nphological and geochemical observations of segments of all scales,\nwhich provide only a limited insight into the formation of the oceanic\ncrust and on the temporal and spatial variation in accretionary pro-\ncesses. By combining multibeam bathymetry, TOBI images, gravity\nand magnetic data with existing seismic velocity and CSEM-derived\nresistivity models of the whole crust and uppermost mantle together\nwith an MT-derived resistivity model for the mantle to 100 km bsl,\nthis study provides geophysical evidence for the relationships be-\ntween tectono-magmatic cycles, subseafloor structure and the mode\nof segment construction along-axis. The cyclicity and along-axis\nvariability of features in this model also explain the lack of observa-\ntion of active crustal magmatic systems at slower-spreading rates as\ntheir observation is dependent on being in the right place at the right\ntime within a cycle. The main results of this study are described\nbelow in the context of a unifying model of crustal accretion along\nan \u223c100 km section of the Reykjanes Ridge (Fig. 19).\nTHE MODEL\nFor most of the life cycle of a segment, far-field tectonic stresses\ngenerate brittle deformation of the crust at the ridge axis. Magma\ndelivery takes place along the ridge trend in an episodic fashion that\ncontrols the initiation of an AVR tectono-magmatic cycle. As melt\nreaches the crust, the first AVR within a segment starts to form at\nthe centre of upwelling orientated in the minimum stress direction,\northogonal to spreading.\nAs also observed during the Krafla eruptions onshore in Iceland,\neruption commences with fissure volcanism (the young stage) and\nprogresses to point-source volcanism, with the creation of conical\nand eventually flat-topped volcanoes (adolescent and mature stages,\nrespectively). At Krafla, this progression in eruption style has been\nobserved to take place within the same eruption cycle and over a\nvery short period of time.\nAs the magmatic part of the cycle wanes, tectonic forces begin to\ndismember this AVR (mature stage) and brittle failure propagates\nnorth and south, facilitating the creation of subsequent AVRs in\na pattern of progressively younger and shorter AVRs moving away\nfrom the original eruption location. The discontinuous nature of and\nperiodicity in melt supply along-axis, therefore, limits the length to\nwhich the segment can evolve. However, as AVRs grow obliquely\nto the ridge axis their extent off-axis (i.e. their length) will also be\ncontrolled by the strength of the ageing lithosphere into which they\npropagate (Searle et al. 1998).\nThe repeated tectonic and magmatic phases continually build and\ndestroy AVRs, with older AVRs generally being longer than younger\nones and located at or near the focus of primary melt influx. The\nyounger AVRs mark the location of most recent melt accumulation\nwithin the crust and hence the location of most recent magmatic ac-\ntivity. Each melt accumulation is sufficient to support of the order of\n\u223c20 000 yr of accretion\u2014corresponding to only \u223c200 m of seafloor\nspreading on each flank at 10 mm yr\u22121 half-rate. It is likely that\nolder AVRs from earlier cycles are dismembered and rafted off-axis\nover the course of several cycles before they leave the neovolcanic\nzone.\nSuccessive accretionary cycles are initiated by repeated influx of\nmelt to the crust. Melt accumulated in the uppermost \u223c50 km of\nthe mantle is transported on a very short geological timescale to\nthe crust where it accumulates at the segment centre and is then\ntransported laterally, primarily through faults and fissures.\nThe episodic nature of melt delivery to the crust results in AVRs\nhaving a range of crustal structures and characteristics that are re-\nflected not only in the seabed morphology but also in along-ridge-\naxis variations in AVR age and length, RMBA amplitude, magneti-\nzation intensity and local spreading-rate. When collectively anal-\nysed these features reveal that, in this study area on the Reyk-\njanes Ridge, the second-order segment immediately north of the\nRAMESSES AVR comprises a set of five third-order AVR segments\nwith an along-axis length of \u223c70 km, typical of second-order seg-\nments elsewhere on the MAR. Tectono-magmatic accretion cycles\noperate both on the longer wavelength scale over the second-order\nsegment as a whole, and on the smaller scale of individual AVRs.\nWithin this second-order segment, AVR 4 appears to be the oldest\nand the longest of the five AVRs at 35 km; it has a locally thickened\ncrust beneath its centre, and a low average magnetization and local\nspreading rate. AVR age and length decrease gradually to the south\ntowards the 57\u25e655\u2032N second-order offset (Searle et al. 1994a) and\nnorth to another offset near 58\u25e615\u2032N.\nThe five AVRs studied, including one each from adjacent second-\norder segments, all have relative RMBA lows associated with their\ncentres which reflect either an increase in crustal thickness of be-\ntween 200 and 800 m and\/or the presence of low-density zones,\nthe latter corresponding to the presence of partial melt in the mid-\nlower crust. Larger mid-lower crustal density anomalies correspond\nto young AVRs undergoing magmatic construction while the in-\ncreased crustal thicknesses correspond to mature AVRs at the end\nof their construction phase. The correlation between relative AVR\nage and length results from older AVRs having simply received more\ninjections of melt and having, therefore, been able to extend further.\nMature AVRs are associated with relative magnetization inten-\nsity lows, while young AVRs show magnetization highs. The young\nAVRs located at the segment ends, therefore, have an extrusive layer\nthat comprises fresher and more recently erupted basalt, or an ax-\nial magmatic system that contains magma that either has had time\nto fractionate before eruption or was already fractionated when it\naccumulated and erupted.\nSpreading rate variations between individual AVRs indicate that\nthe magmatic phase of the cycle locally \u2018speeds up\u2019 spreading by\nup to 20 per cent compared to older AVRs in their tectonic phase.\nThis increase in spreading rate occurs for no more than \u223c1\u20131.5 M\nyr (the finest timing resolution we can achieve in this study from\nmagnetic reversals), after which spreading returns to that of the \u2018far-\nfield\u2019 spreading rate for the ridge as a whole. AVR construction is\nalso accompanied by asymmetric spreading in a pattern mirrored\nin the short-wavelength RMBA, where thinner crust is correlated\nwith the direction of fastest spreading, either through differential\ntectonic extension or asymmetric magma injection into the crust.\nFurther support for our preferred model comes in the form of\nthe observed asymmetry and cross-sectional form of the median\nvalley south of 59\u25e6N. Thatcher & Hill (1995) propose that the\ndominant factors which influence the morphological expression\nof mid-ocean ridges are magmatism and tectonism, with magma-\ntism being the dominant process accommodating plate separation\nand tectonism being the dominant process in producing seabed\nrelief. They also conclude that variation in the rate of magmatism\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\nTemporal and spatial cyclicity of accretion at slow-spreading ridges 75\nLow I Increasing IIncreasing I\nshorter\n+\nyounger AVRs\n(b) Cross-sectional view\nmelt ascentmelt ascent\nshorter\n+\nyounger AVRs\ntransition zone to next AVR \u201cset\u201d\nRAMESSES\nAVR\nAVR 1 AVR 2 AVR 4 AVR 6 AVR 7\nobserved\nmelt lens\n(a) Plan view\n70 km\n11.3\n8.1\n12.8\n10.7\n10.9\n10.9\n12.3\n10.6\n11.3\n9.5\n?\n?\n?\n?\nRMBA\nand\nRMBA\nand\nRMBA\nandLow I\nRMBA\nand\nslow-spreading faster-\nspreading\nfaster-\nspreading\nS\nec\non\nd\nor\nde\nr\ndi\nsc\non\nti\nnu\nit\ny\ndi\nsc\non\nti\nnu\nit\ny\n?\nFigure 19.

In Thatcher & Hill\u2019s (1995) model\nfor the case of symmetrical spreading, throughout periods of in-\ncreased magmatic accretion the rift valley floor will increase in\nwidth and normal faulting will be subdued, while during periods of\ndecreased magmatic accretion tectonism and rift valley wall con-\nstruction will dominate, with both feature types being preserved in\nthe seabed morphology as it spreads away from the ridge axis. Thus\nif faulting and magmatism are continuous the model predicts that\nnot only should the seabed morphology be symmetrical about the\nridge axis, but that there should be no hiatus between fault terraces\nor significant changes in relief between those terraces. They also\nshow that in the case of asymmetric spreading, the resulting seabed\nrelief is more rugged on the more slowly accreting side.\nFig. 7 shows the off-axis seabed topography in the region of\nthe RAMESSES AVR and the corresponding fault geometries. It\nalso shows that the main fault terraces are separated by relatively\nunfaulted regions and that the seabed topography is asymmetric\nabout the ridge axis. In addition, Topping (2002) and Peirce et al.\n(2005), interpreting a grid of multichannel seismic reflection profiles\nacquired across the RAMESSES AVR, show that there is a distinct\nasymmetry in the faulting pattern with terraces separated at 2\u20135 km\n(200 000\u2013500 000 yr) intervals which also correspond to periods\nof enhanced magmatism as evidenced by a correspondingly thicker\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, GJI, 163, 56\u201378\n76 C. Peirce, A. Gardiner and M. Sinha\nextrusive layer within the upper crust. These observations, in the\ncontext of Thatcher & Hill\u2019s (1995) study, lend further support to\ncyclic rather continuous accretion and tectonism.\nAlthough our model satisfies the observations and modelling of\nall data sets considered in this study, it is unlikely to be the only\npossible model. For example, it may be that faulting and magmatism\nare closely linked, taking place at the same time and throughout\nthe life cycle of each AVR. In this alternative model, the atectonic\n(or the magmatic) phase of a tectono-magmatic cycle could simply\nbe a manifestation of the on-going faulting being overprinted, or\nconcealed, by frequent lava eruptions. However, the latter implies\nan effectively continuous magma supply which contradicts all of\nthe evidence from the RAMESSES and other studies that crustal\nmagma bodies at slow spreading rates are ephemeral and relatively\nshort lived.\nIt is likely that our model could be improved and refined by the\naddition of more, and higher resolution, survey data. This should\nideally include the collection, analysis and reliable dating of a dense\narray of fresh seabed samples; comprehensive photographic imag-\ning; and a complete analysis of strain and spreading rates on both\nsides of the axis, on at least the length-scale (along and across axis)\nof an AVR. Such a comprehensive data set does not exist for any\npart of the mid-ocean ridge system\u2014indeed the section of Reykjanes\nRidge presented here is already amongst the most comprehensively\nstudied parts of that system. In the context of all the available data\nfrom the Reykjanes Ridge, and the knowledge gleaned from studies\nof ridges at all spreading rates and settings, we believe that the model\npresented here provides the most consistent possible interpretation\nof the relationships between magmatic and tectonic processes, their\ncyclic variability and along-axis segmentation.\n9 C O N C L U S I O N S\nThe results from this study provide convincing geophysical evidence\nfor the episodic accumulation in and transport of melt from the\nmantle to the crust, which initiates and drives cycles of tectonic and\nmagmatic phases of accretion. The conclusions, summarized below,\nprimarily reflect processes operating at the AVR and larger scale,\nalthough they do also have implications for smaller-scale compo-\nsitional variation. The conclusions are presented in scale order and\nthe underlying assumptions upon which they are based can be found\nin the stated sections.\n(1) The southern limit of any major hotspot influence on crustal\nthickness and magma production rates along the Reykjanes Ridge\nis \u223c59\u25e6N. [Section 5.1]\n(2) The shoaling seabed towards Iceland is mirrored in the FAA,\nwhich suggests that the elevated topographic swell associated with\nthe Iceland hotspot is not in complete isostatic equilibrium, but is\ninstead partly supported dynamically by processes associated with\nthe mantle plume. Modelling shows that the swell is also partly\ncompensated by a decrease in mantle density and a corresponding\nincrease in crustal thickness heading towards the hotspot centre.\n[Section 5.1]\n(3) A second-order segment is shown to be \u223c70 km in length\nalong-axis and comprises multiple third-order AVRs. A tectono-\nmagmatic cycle operates over the entire segment length as well as\nat individual AVRs. [Section 7.1]\n(4) AVRs undergo a life cycle from the young to adolescent\nstages of a magmatic phase when crustal construction occurs,\nthrough to the mature and old stages of a tectonic phase when AVRs\nare dismembered and rafted off-axis. However, at the very end of the\nmagmatic phase AVRs may be rejuvenated by late stage volcanism.\n[Section 4; Section 7.1]\n(5) Volcanism starts first at the AVR at the segment centre then\npropagates outwards along the segment to build other AVRs as the\ncycle progresses. [Section 6.8; Section 8]\n(6) AVRs are typically older and longer at the segment centre\nand younger and shorter at segment ends. Older AVRs generally\nhave lower average magnetization intensities than younger AVRs,\nsuggesting that basalts there have been extruded for longer and have\nundergone more low-temperature oxidation or that the erupted lavas\nwere less fractionated. [Section 4; Section 7]\n(7) Gravity models of individual AVRs support a segment-scale\nmodel where cyclic injections of melt gradually build adjacent\nAVRs. Density anomalies beneath young AVRs are consistent with\nthe presence of partial melt in the mid-lower crust, indicating that\nthey are presently undergoing magmatic construction, while slightly\nolder AVRs, from young to adolescent in age, have smaller density\nanomalies consistent with slightly less melt in the crust and with\ndeclining magmatic accretion. Mature AVRs have thicker crust be-\nneath their centres, suggesting that they are at the very end of the\nmagmatic phase of their cycle, with the crust built to its maximum\nthickness by repeated injections of melt. [Section 4; Section 6]\n(8) An \u223c20 per cent increase in spreading rate associated with\nyoung AVRs detectable over the last 1\u20131.5 Ma suggests that mag-\nmatic accretion increases the local spreading rate. Asymmetry in\nspreading rate results in thinner crust underlying the faster spread-\ning ridge flank. [Section 7.2]\nThe above conclusions support a model of crustal accretion along\n\u223c100 km of the Reykjanes Ridge that explains tectono-magmatic\ncycles in terms of patterns of mantle upwelling and segmentation\nalong the ridge axis. Far-field tectonic stresses result in spreading-\northogonal brittle deformation of the crust in the neovolcanic zone,\nwith fractures tapping initially the upwelling melt. An AVR is con-\nstructed over these fractures, initially through fissure volcanism (the\nyoung stage), and progressively point-source volcanism dominates,\nwith the creation of conical and eventually flat-topped volcanoes\n(adolescent and mature stages respectively). Brittle failure propa-\ngates away from the initial point of magma injection in both direc-\ntions along-axis. These new fractures laterally tap the melt supply,\nresulting in the creation of new AVRs and the pattern of progres-\nsively younger and shorter AVRs towards the segment ends. As the\nmagmatic part of the cycle wanes, tectonic forces dismember AVRs\n(the old stage). This cycle repeats along the ridge axis and through\ntime, initiated by the episodic influx of melt from the uppermost\n\u223c50 km of the mantle below.\nFinally, the results of this study are compatible with all other\ngeophysical experiments undertaken south of \u223c59\u25e6N on the Reyk-\njanes Ridge and all crustal thickness determinations along its entire\nlength. It represents a fully integrated geophysical study of the re-\nlationship between the temporal variations in crustal accretionary\nprocesses at slow-spreading ridges and their along-axis segmenta-\ntion. It has revealed that tectono-magmatic cycles of accretion do\noperate both at the third-order AVR-scale and also over the entire\nsecond-order segment which the AVRs studied here comprise.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nThis research was supported by the University of Durham via a PhD\nstudentship (AG).
