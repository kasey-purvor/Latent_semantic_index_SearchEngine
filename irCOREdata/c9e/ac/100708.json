Both novel and established direct nuclear\nreaction tools are vital for investigations of the one- and\ntwo-nucleon behavior in nuclear many-body systems. By using\nsufficiently energetic collisions of a projectile and a target\nnucleus, one, two, or a cluster of nucleons can be removed,\nexcited, or transferred directly between the participating\nnuclei in surface-dominated, grazing collisions. Such reactions\ninvolve only a few degrees of freedom and so avoid the full,\nmany-body complications that arise from the formation of\na highly excited intermediate compound system. Observables\nfrom such direct reactions provide information on the overlaps\nbetween the many-body wave functions of the projectile (and\ntarget) and the final states of the residual nuclei. Classic\nexamples of direct reactions used to probe the states of single\nnucleons (and the single-nucleon overlap functions) are the\nlight-ion-induced transfer reactions, e.g., AZ(d, p)A+1Z and\nAZ(p, d)A\u22121Z. These have been studied over a wide range\nof incident energies. Whereas the former reaction deposits\na neutron onto the AZ system, thus populating particle-like\nstates at and above the Fermi surface, the latter removes a\nneutron and so selectively populates hole-like configurations\nin the residue.\nUnstable nuclei with extreme neutron-to-proton ratios have\nbecome one major focus of nuclear structure research. Today,\nmany of the most exotic nuclei are produced by fast projectile\nfragmentation. The exotic nuclei of interest are thus available\nfor experiments as secondary ion beams, typically with\nv\/c\u0001 0.3, necessitating experiments in inverse kinematics.\nThe fast heavy-ion projectiles allow the use of thick reaction\ntargets leading to very forward-focused residues that are\ndetected with high efficiency. Viable in-beam experiments are\nthus feasible with just a few such ions per second. This use\nof thick targets, to compensate for low intensity, means that\n\u03b3 -ray detection replaces particle spectroscopy for identifying\nthe final states of the reaction residues.\nThis basic efficacy of fast fragmentation beams has\nprompted the development of new direct reactions to\nprobe rare nuclei. One-nucleon removal reactions, e.g.,\n9Be(AZ,A\u22121 [Z \u2212 1])X, have been developed into one such\nnovel spectroscopic tool [1]. However, the reactions remove\na nucleon from the projectile ground state and therefore\nselectively populate single-hole configurations in the (mass\nA \u2212 1) reaction residues. In these reactions, quantitative\nnuclear structure information is extracted by comparisons of\nthe measured cross sections with those predicated by the shell\nmodel and reaction theory. The latter exploits\u2014because of the\nhigh beam energies\u2014the sudden and eikonal approximations\n[1,2]. As well as being an excellent probe of the structures of\nhalo nuclei (e.g., Ref. [3]) the knockout reaction measurements\nhave (i) observed strong nucleon-nucleon (NN ) correlation\neffects missing from shell-model-like effective-interaction\ntheories [4,5] and (ii) contributed very significantly to mapping\nthe evolution of shell structure, the disappearance of familiar\nmagic numbers, and the formation of new shell gaps in nuclei\nwith extreme N\/Z ratios, e.g., Refs. [6\u201310].\nHere we explore a complementary reaction, single-nucleon\npickup from a light target onto a fast projectile beam. Specifi-\ncally, we consider proton-pickup reactions on a thick 9Be tar-\nget. The extent to which the final state of the target-like residue\nis determined will be discussed later. Potentially, this pickup\nmechanism could complement knockout studies through the\nselective population of single particle-like configurations in\nthe mass A + 1 residues. In the following we therefore make\nan initial assessment of this feasibility using first available\nmeasurements of the proton pickup reaction 9Be(20Ne,21Na)X\nat 63.4 MeV\/nucleon. We apply a distorted-waves (DW) and\nshell-model theoretical description. The ground state proton\nseparation energy from 9Be is Sp = 16.89 MeV and therefore\nbreakup effects (as they arise for example in (d, n) proton\ntransfer) need not enter our present discussion. In addition,\nbecause 9Be has no bound excited states, inelastic excitation\nof the target can be assumed to be included in the (highly)\nabsorptive 20Ne + 9Be optical interaction.\nPrevious studies of proton particle-like states have been\nthe realm of (d, n) and (3He, d) light-ion-induced transfer\nreactions on stable targets carried out in normal kinematics.\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(6)\/061302(5) 061302-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nA. GADE et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 061302(R) (2007)\nLow-energy (of order 10 MeV\/u) heavy-ion-induced transfer\nreactions have proven to be valuable for spectroscopic studies\nof stable nuclei (e.g., Ref. [11]), also revealing a selectivity\ntoward high-j single-particle orbitals [12]. The momen-\ntum distributions of projectile-like fragments in heavy-ion-\ninduced pickup reactions produced at projectile energies above\n80 MeV\/nucleon have been studied [13] and spin-polarized\nexotic beams have been produced using single-nucleon pickup\nat 150 MeV\/nucleon [14]. Programs are also emerging to\nperform barrier-energy heavy-ion transfer experiments with\nexotic beams [15]. With reference to our chosen reaction,\n9Be(20Ne,21Na), low-energy analyses of (d, n) and (3He, d)\nreaction data on a 20Ne target are also available, most\nrecently in Refs. [16] and [17], respectively. These analyses\nare in reasonable agreement with the sd-shell model, dis-\ncussed here in the context of the present intermediate-energy\nmeasurements.\nGeneric considerations of linear (and angular) momentum\nmatching in particle-transfer reactions at higher collision\nenergies favor the use of targets in which the transferred\nnucleon is more deeply bound [18,19]. For example, the (\u03b1, t)\nreaction was used at RIKEN to study proton configurations\nin neutron-rich 23F, using the \u03b1(22O,23F) reaction at 63 MeV\nper nucleon [20,21]. The 9Be target of the present work also\nprovides such well-bound protons (with Sp = 16.89 MeV) but\navoids experimental complications arising from the use of a\ngas target. At energies of order 60 MeV\/nucleon and greater,\nthe linear and angular momentum matching for single-nucleon\ntransfer is not optimal [18] for maximizing the yield for\ntransfer of nucleons into the available low-\u0003, bound sd-shell\nstates in 21Na. Rather, we depend upon the strong binding\nand extended momentum distribution of the transferred proton\nin the 9Be target to generate a sufficiently extended higher\nenergy tail to the transfer yield to make the pickup cross\nsection measurements feasible, typically of order 1 mb. See\nalso Ref. [21].\nExperiment and results. The 20Ne secondary beam of\nthe present experiment was produced by fragmentation of a\n150 MeV per nucleon 36Ar primary beam, delivered by the\nCoupled Cyclotron Facility of the National Superconducting\nCyclotron Laboratory, onto a 893 mg\/cm2 9Be production\ntarget. The ions of interest were selected in the A1900 fragment\nseparator [22], which was operated at 0.5% momentum\nacceptance. The 20Ne secondary beam was then incident on a\n188(4) mg\/cm2 thick 9Be reaction target positioned at the focus\nof the large-acceptance S800 spectrograph [23]. The reaction\nresidues were identified on an event-by-event basis from the\ntime of flight taken between two scintillators, the energy loss\nwas measured in the ionization chamber, and the position\nand angle information was provided by the cathode readout\ndrift chambers of the S800 focal-plane detector system [23]\n(see Fig. 1). The longitudinal momentum distributions of\nthe unreacted 20Ne beam and of the 21Na one-proton pickup\nresidues were obtained from trajectory reconstruction [24].\nAn inclusive cross section of 1.85(12) mb was measured\nfor the 9Be(20Ne,21Na)X one-proton pickup reaction based on\nthe yield of 21Na reaction residues divided by the number of\nincoming 20Ne projectiles relative to the number density of\nthe reaction target. Systematic uncertainties of 4 and 2% were\nE\nne\nrg\ny \nlo\nss\n (\nar\nb.\n u\nni\nts\n)\nTime of flight (arb. units)\n21Na\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Identification of the 20Ne + 9Be projectile-\nlike reaction residues in the S800 focal plane, shown as the energy\nloss measured in the ionization chamber versus the ion\u2019s time of flight.\nThe 21Na one-proton pickup residues are clearly separated from the\nother reaction residues.\nattributed to the stability of the incoming beam and the choice\nof the software gates, respectively. These were assumed to be\nindependent and were added in quadrature to the statistical\nuncertainty.\nThe secondary 9Be target was surrounded by SeGA, an\narray of 32-fold segmented HPGe detectors [25]. Sixteen\ndetectors were arranged in two rings (with 90\u25e6 and 37\u25e6 central\nangles with respect to the beam axis). The 37\u25e6 ring was\nequipped with seven detectors and the 90\u25e6 ring with nine\ndetectors. The photo-peak efficiency of the array was measured\nwith 152Eu and 226Ra calibration standards and corrected for\nthe Lorentz boost of the \u03b3 -ray distribution emitted by nuclei\nmoving with v\/c \u2248 0.3.\nIn coincidence with the 21Na one-proton pickup residues\ndetected in the S800, \u03b3 -ray transitions at 330(3) keV and\n1382(4) keV and around 2420 keV were detected in SeGA\n(see Fig. 2). Three 21Na excited states are known below its\nproton separation energy Sp = 2.43 MeV (see inset of Fig. 2).\nThe 330 keV transition depopulates the first excited 5\/2+ state\nto the 3\/2+ ground state. The 1382 keV transition corresponds\nto the decay from the first excited 7\/2+ state to the 5\/2+ level\nand a 2424 keV \u03b3 decay connects the first excited 1\/2+ state\nand the ground state. For the 7\/2+ state, a 7.5(33)% branch to\nthe ground state has been reported but could not be observed\nin the present experiment.\nFrom the \u03b3 -ray branching ratios and the level scheme of\n21Na, the cross sections for the one-proton pickup to individual\n21Na final states were deduced from an input-output balance.\nThe 5\/2+ state is populated the strongest at 86(6)%. All other\nstates are much less fed by the reaction. The cross section for\nthe pickup to the 7\/2+ level was corrected for the 7.5% branch\nto the ground state reported in the literature. For the 1\/2+ state\njust below the proton separation energy, an upper limit for\nthe cross section was derived. The population of the ground\nstate was obtained by subtraction and found to be consistent\nwith zero, with an upper limit of 0.06 mb. In the laboratory\nframe, a \u03b3 -ray transition was detected at 981 keV (see Fig. 2)\nand is attributed to population of the only bound excited state,\n8Li(1+), of the target residue. The cross section to this final\nstate is 0.13(4) mb. The experimental results are summarized\nin Table I.\n061302-2\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nINVERSE-KINEMATICS ONE-PROTON PICKUP WITH . . .

For a first analysis of the present data, transfer\nreaction calculations were performed using the post form of\nthe finite-range distorted waves Born approximation (DWBA)\nusing the direct reactions code FRESCO [27]. A one-step\nproton transfer was assumed from 9Be in the initial state\nand, in all channels, the final states were assumed to be\ntwo-body. The 9Be(20Ne,21Na)X reaction was thus assumed\nto be dominated by direct transfer processes calculated as\n20Ne(9Be, 8Li(I+))21Na(j\u03c0 ) at 63.4 MeV per nucleon incident\nenergy. In these calculations the highly absorptive nuclear parts\nof the 20Ne + 9Be and 21Na + 8Li interactions were assumed\nto be identical. These were calculated, as in recent nucleon\nknockout reaction studies, by double folding the neutron and\nproton densities in 20Ne (from Hartree-Fock calculations) and\nin 9Be (assumed Gaussian with rms radius of 2.36 fm) with\nan effective NN interaction [2]. The target-like, [8Li(I+) \u2297\n\u0005j ]3\/2\u2212 , and projectile-like, [20Ne(0+) \u2297 \u03c6j ]j , proton-core\nrelative motion wave functions (overlaps) \u0005j and \u03c6j were\ntreated as follows.\nThe 21Na(j+) states were calculated in real Woods-\nSaxon potentials with radius and diffuseness parameters r0 =\n1.25 fm and a0 = 0.7 fm. A spin-orbit interaction of 6 MeV\nand the same geometry parameters were added. The 5\/2+\n(0.332 MeV) and 1\/2+ (2.424 MeV) bound states used the\nphysical separation energies. For the relatively narrow 5\/2+\n(4.294 MeV) and 3\/2+ (4.468 MeV) proton-unbound states\ntwo continuum bins were constructed that include the full\nstrength of the resonances, the real potential depths being\nadjusted so that the 5\/2+ and 3\/2+ p + 20Ne phase shifts\npassed through \u03c0\/2 at the appropriate center of mass energies.\nThe cross section to each of the 21Na final states is scaled by\nthe shell-model spectroscopic factors, C2S.\nOur 9Be(3\/2\u2212) to 8Li(I+) overlaps use the Variational\nMonte Carlo (VMC) overlaps and their associated spec-\ntroscopic amplitudes of Wiringa et al. [28]. For conve-\nnience, the tabulated numerical I\u03c0 = 1+(\u22120.403 \u00d7 1p3\/2 and\n0.456 \u00d7 1p1\/2), I \u03c0 = 2+(0.759 \u00d7 1p3\/2 and 0.393 \u00d7 1p1\/2),\nand I\u03c0 = 3+(0.480 \u00d7 1p3\/2) channel overlaps were each\nfitted by scaling the normalized 1p3\/2 and 1p1\/2 radial wave\nTABLE I.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 061302(R) (2007)\nfunctions calculated in different Woods-Saxon potentials.\nThese fitted potentials and the VMC spectroscopic amplitudes\nwere then used for the binding and transfer interactions in\nFRESCO. Thus, while in the present study we examine the USD\nshell-model spectroscopic factors C2S [26] in the context of the\n21Na(j+) final state yields, it should be noted that these VMC\namplitudes and 9Be to 8Li(I\u03c0 ) radial overlaps are implicit in\nthe calculations presented.\nIn Table I the experimental results are compared to the\ncalculations outlined above. The pattern of the measured\npopulations of the known 21Na particle-like bound states, in\nparticular the observed dominance of the 5\/2+ state and the\nvanishing population to the ground state, is in good agreement\nwith the (d, n) [16] and (3He, d) [17] light-ion reaction\nanalyses. Population of the 7\/2+ (1.72 MeV) state, observed\nwith low yields in the light-ion and the present heavy-ion\nexperiments, is indicative of a higher-order process. Such\nexcitations, described quantitatively in Ref. [16] by including\nthe 20Ne(2+, 1.63 MeV) inelastic channel, and [20Ne(2+) \u2297\n\u03c6j ]7\/2 transfers, can be included in the future. Our emphasis\nhere is on the known single-particle-like configurations. The\n5\/2+ (4.294 MeV) and 3\/2+ (4.468 MeV) proton-unbound\nexcited states are also predicted to be populated in the reaction,\nbut are unobserved here in \u03b3 spectroscopy.\nThus, the overall magnitude of the inclusive cross section\nand the population pattern to individual 21Na(j+) final states\nare well reproduced when combining the DWBA model and\nthe spectroscopic factors C2S from the USD shell model. This\ngives promise that the reaction mechanism may indeed have\nthe potential to locate dominant single-particle-like strength\nusing fast rare isotope beams. We note however that, from this\nanalysis, there is a significant deviation of the measured and\ncalculated cross sections for the transfer to the 8Li(1+) excited\nstate, which the calculations overestimate. The amplitudes of\nthe target overlaps for this 1+ configuration enter through the\nVMC values, discussed above. Such details of the distribution\nof the final state yields with respect to the target-like residues\ncannot be addressed with the present data set. Additional\ndata, using different projectiles and targets (e.g., 12C) will be\nnecessary to understand this target-like residue distribution.\nIt will also be very valuable to determine the extent to which\ndetails of the target structures (and target-like final state yields)\naffect the cross section distributions to the final states of the\nheavy pickup residues. This dependence could be rather weak\nin the case of such poorly linear and angular momentum\nmatched reactions.\nThe measured inclusive longitudinal momentum distribu-\ntion of the 21Na pickup residues and that of the unreacted\n20Ne projectile beam after passage through the target are\nshown in Fig. 3. The measured 21Na residue distribution is\nnarrow compared to typical momentum distributions from\none-nucleon knockout reactions and thus strongly supports\nthe direct nature of the pickup reaction. As one would\nexpect, the 21Na parallel momentum distribution is broadened\ncompared to that of the unreacted 20Ne as a result of\nthe differential momentum loss from the pickup reactions\ntaking place toward the front or the back of the 9Be reac-\ntion target, resulting in a rectangular distribution of width\n0.13 GeV\/c.\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nCo\nun\nts \n\/ 8\n.1\n M\neV\n\/c\n7.06.96.86.76.6\np   (GeV\/c)\n||\n20\n21\nNe\nNa\nFIG. 3. (Color online) Measured longitudinal momentum distri-\nbutions of the 21Na one-proton pickup residues and of the unreacted\n20Ne beam having passed through the target. The solid curve is the\npredicted distribution based on two-body direct reactions and is\nthe result of the convolution of the unreacted 20Ne distribution and\nthe differential energy loss of the 21Na residues in the reaction target.\nGiven the assumed two-body nature of the 8Li + 21Na final\nstates, the intrinsic transfer reaction d\u03c3\/dp\u2016 distributions are\nvery narrow compared to those discussed above. Explicitly, if\nthe particles in the final state are 3 and 4, and labels 1 and\n3 refer to the heavy projectile and the projectile-like residue,\nrespectively,\nd\u03c3\ndp\u2016\n= 2\u03c0\np3\n{\nm3\n(m3 + m4)\np1\np3\ncos \u03b8L \u2212 1\n}\nd\u03c3\nd\tL\n, (1)\nwhere d\u03c3\/d\tL is the transfer reaction differential cross\nsection in the laboratory frame and p3 the residue momentum\nat the laboratory angle \u03b8L. The Q values are also all sufficiently\nsimilar that there is essentially no broadening when adding\nthe different final state contributions. Thus, the shape of the\nexpected momentum distribution is the convolution of the\ndifferential energy loss and the unreacted 20Ne profile. This\nis shown by the solid curve in Fig. 3, to be compared with the\n21Na distribution. The width is in reasonable agreement with\nthe measured distribution, but there are indications, from the\ntails on the experimental distribution, of small contributions\nfrom other than the two-body final states assumed in the\npresent reaction dynamics treatment, such as our approximate\ntreatment of the unbound 8Li(3+) excited state.\nUnlike in knockout reaction measurements, the pickup\nresidue momentum distribution is not expected to contain\nspectroscopic information. Nevertheless, it is shown to have\nuseful diagnostic value for our understanding of the reaction\nmechanism, e.g., the possible importance of missing target-like\nchannels that lead to more complex (few-body) final states.\nSummary. In summary, we have investigated an example\nof an inverse kinematics, (AZ,A+1 [Z + 1]) proton pickup\nreaction on a 9Be target as a possible tool for the study of\nparticle-like structures in exotic nuclei that are available only\nas low-intensity, fast fragmentation beams. The results for a\n20Ne beam of 63 MeV per nucleon were found to be consistent\nwith distorted waves transfer reaction and shell-model theory.\nThe measured residue momentum distribution is narrow and\n061302-4\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nINVERSE-KINEMATICS ONE-PROTON PICKUP WITH . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 061302(R) (2007)\nis strongly supportive of the direct nature of the mechanism\nunderlying the measured pickup reaction events.\nOutstanding details of the distribution of the final state\nyields with respect to the target-like residues will require\nadditional data, ideally using different projectiles and targets.\nThe extent to which details of the target structures affect the\ncross section distributions to the final states of the heavy exotic\npickup residues of interest can then be examined.\nThe pattern of the observed population of the specific 21Na\nfinal states yields nuclear structure information in line with\nthe predictions of shell-model calculations and verifies that the\nreaction mechanism (i) can be accessed with current experi-\nmental tools and (ii) could be a very significant complementary\nspectroscopic technique for the spectroscopy of particle states\nin the most exotic systems. Because this reaction mechanism\nfavors the population of single-particle states with high orbital\nangular momentum, it will be well suited to identify \u0003 = 3\nintruder states in the vicinity of the \u201cisland of inversion\u201d [29]\nand aid in the quest to unravel new exotic regions in the nuclear\nchart where high-\u0003 intruder orbitals descend across shell gaps\nand significantly modify the nuclear structure as established\nfor stable nuclei.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with B.
