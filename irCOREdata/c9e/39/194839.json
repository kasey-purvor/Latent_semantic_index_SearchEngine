Using our latest heavy-element blanketed\nnon-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) stellar atmosphere calculations we have ad-\ndressed the heavy-element abundance patterns, making completely objective measurements of\nabundance values and upper limits using a \u03c72 fitting technique to determine the uncertainties\nin the abundance measurements, which can be related to the formal upper limits in those stars\nwhere particular elements are not detected.\nWe find that the presence or absence of heavy elements in the hot DA white dwarfs largely\nreflects what would be expected if radiative levitation is the supporting mechanism, although\nthe measured abundances do not match the predicted values very well, as reported by other\nauthors in the past. Almost all stars hotter than \u223c50 000 K contain heavy elements. For most of\nthese the spread in element abundances is quite narrow and similar to the abundances measured\nin G191-B2B. However, there is an unexplained dichotomy at lower temperatures with some\nstars having apparently pure H envelopes and others having detectable quantities of heavy\nelements. The heavy elements present in these cooler stars are often stratified, lying in the\noutermost layers of the envelope. A few strong temperature\/evolutionary effects are seen in\nthe abundance measurements. There is a decreasing Si abundance with temperature, the N\nabundance pattern splits into two groups at lower temperature and there is a sharp decline in\nFe and Ni abundance to zero, below \u223c50 000 K. When detected, the Fe and Ni abundances\nmaintain an approximately constant ratio, close to the cosmic value of \u223c20. For the hottest\nwhite dwarfs observed by STIS, the strongest determinant of abundance appears to be gravity.\nKey words: stars: abundances \u2013 white dwarfs \u2013 ultraviolet: stars.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe existence of two distinct groups of hot white dwarfs, having ei-\nther hydrogen-rich or helium-rich atmospheres is now, qualitatively\nat least, understood to arise from the number of times the progen-\nitor star ascends the red giant branch and the amount of H (and\nHe) lost through the successive phases of mass loss. Consequently,\nit seems clear that each group descends from their respective pro-\nposed progenitors, the H-rich and He-rich central stars of planetary\n\u0002E-mail: mab@star.le.ac.uk\nnebulae (CSPN). Nevertheless, there remain several features of the\nwhite dwarf cooling sequence that cannot be readily explained. For\nexample, while the hottest H-rich DA white dwarfs outnumber the\nHe-rich DOs by a factor of 7 (Fleming, Liebert & Green 1986),\nthe relative number of H- and He-rich CSPN is only approximately\n4:1 (Napiwotzki 1999). In addition, there exists a gap in the He-rich\ntrack between \u224845 000 and 30 000 K between the hot DO and cooler\nDB white dwarfs (Wesemael, Green & Liebert 1985; Liebert et al.\n1986), confirmed by a detailed spectroscopic analysis of all the then\nknown hot He-rich objects by Dreizler & Werner (1996).\nTo understand white dwarf evolution, we need to know accu-\nrately several physical parameters for each star. For example, a\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatterns in hot DA white dwarfs 871\nmeasurement of effective temperature (T eff) establishes how far\nalong its evolutionary sequence the star has progressed. A key re-\nsult has been the establishment of the temperature scale for DA stars\nthrough the determination of T eff from the Balmer line profiles in\noptical spectra. Bergeron, Saffer & Liebert (1992) were the first to\napply the technique to a large sample of white dwarfs. Combin-\ning, their results with the white dwarf evolutionary models of Wood\n(1992), they were able to study the mass distribution of these stars in\ndetail. Subsequent studies have taken into account the inclusion of\nthin external layers of non-degenerate H and He in the evolutionary\nmodels (Wood 1995). Although the sample of Bergeron et al. (1992)\nwas constructed from a somewhat heterogeneous group of stars in\nthe temperature range downward from \u223c40 000 K, few objects in\nexcess of 25 000 K were included. Yet it is the hotter objects that are\nthe most important test of the evolutionary models, having the great-\nest departure from the zero-temperature Hamada & Salpeter (1961)\nmass\u2013radius relation. The Palomar\u2013Green (PG) survey includes a\nlarge number of white dwarfs with effective temperatures extending\nup to 80 000 K or so, while the extreme ultraviolet- (EUV-) selected\nsamples of Marsh et al. (1997) and Vennes et al. (1997) contained a\nmajority of white dwarfs with T eff above 25 000 K.\nThe reliability of this work depends on the assumption that the\nBalmer line profile technique is a reliable estimator of T eff in all\ncases. Bergeron et al. (1994) demonstrated that spectroscopically\nundetectable traces of He could undermine the DA temperature scale\nat temperatures above \u224850 000 K. However, Napiwotzki (1997)\nshowed this to be an artefact of assuming local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE). Also, the lack of observable photospheric He in\nmost hot DAs (Barstow, Holberg & Koester 1995; Barstow et al.\n1997) could be used to argue against this being a real problem. On\nthe other hand, Dreizler & Werner (1993) posed the question of\nwhether or not the ubiquitous presence of elements heavier than H\nor He in the hottest DAs might also alter the Balmer line profiles.\nThey concluded that the effect would only be very small, but their\nearly non-LTE models did not include a sufficient number of level\ntransitions to account realistically for the observed line blanketing.\nUsing more recent model calculations, Barstow, Hubeny & Holberg\n(1998) have shown that the presence of substantial blanketing from\nphotospheric heavy elements does significantly alter the Balmer line\nprofiles at a given effective temperature. Hence, the temperature\nscale of the hottest, most metal-rich DA white dwarfs, realized by\nstudies using only pure H photospheric models, cannot be viewed\nas reliable and must be revised taking into account the photospheric\ncomposition of each star.\nUntil recently very few DA white dwarfs were known to have ef-\nfective temperatures above 70 000 K. Therefore, the proposed direct\nevolutionary link between H-rich CSPN and white dwarfs has barely\nbeen explored. In particular, there have been no measurements of the\nphotospheric composition of what might be termed super-hot DAs,\nto distinguish them from the cooler ranges studied in detail. The\nROSAT and EUVE sky surveys discovered a few examples of such\nvery hot stars and a detailed survey of the central stars of old plane-\ntary nebulae (PNe) has revealed a number of others (see Napiwotzki\n1999). To date, all the studies of these objects have utilized pure H\nmodels to determine T eff and log g and have not taken into account\nthe possible presence of heavy elements, which might be expected\nto lower their perceived temperature in turn. However, apart from\ngeneral indications of the presence of heavy-element opacity, from\nthe EUV and soft X-ray fluxes, no direct measurements of element\nabundances have been made for these stars.\nConsequently, we have carried out a survey of a sample of very\nhot DA white dwarfs with the aim of making the first measure-\nments of their photospheric composition. Using a new grid of non-\nLTE, heavy-element-rich model atmospheres we have analysed new\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectro-\ngraph (STIS) and FUSE spectra to measure the abundances of all\nelements detected. We have also redetermined the values of T eff\nand log g for the stars in the light of these results, showing that,\nas might be expected, their temperatures are lower than the val-\nues inferred from earlier pure H analyses. In the wider context of\nwhite dwarf evolution, we now have the opportunity of comparing\nthe abundances of these very hot objects with their immediate hot\nwhite dwarf descendants. To facilitate this, we have re-examined\nall the archive far-UV spectra for the hot DA white dwarfs, from\nIUE and HST , obtaining revised photospheric abundance measure-\nments based on our new model calculations. In one case, that of\nPG1342+444, where neither IUE nor HST data were available we\nused data from the FUSE mission to measure abundances for those\nspecies detected in this band. FUSE spectra are also available for\nseveral stars in the sample. However, as the coverage of our sample\nis not yet complete and we are concentrating on a study of those\nspecies detected in the 1100\u20131750 A\u02da range covered by IUE and\nHST , we do not include them in the current work.\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N S\nAll the new far-UV spectroscopic observations were obtained as\npart of a joint HST STIS (cycle 8) and FUSE (cycle 1) programme,\nwith Table 1 listing the observation dates and instruments.\n2.1 FUSE spectra\nAn overview of the FUSE mission has been given by Moos\net al.

Composite FUSE spectrum of the hot DA white dwarf\nPG1342+444 produced by co-adding the individual exposures and merg-\ning the resulting spectra for the individual detector segments.\nincluded in the FUSE Observer\u2019s Guide (Oegerle et al. 1998), which\ncan be found with other technical documentation on the FUSE web-\nsite (http:\/\/fuse.pha.jhu.edu). In this paper, only the PG1342+444\nspectrum was drawn from our FUSE programme. We have already\npublished an initial analysis of this star and our basic reduction\nand analysis of the FUSE spectrum is described therein (Barstow\net al. 2002). The resulting spectrum, combining all exposures and\nspectral ranges of PG1342+444 is shown in Fig. 1. The main dif-\nference between this work and the earlier paper is that we have\napplied a more recent version of the FUSE calibration and utilized\nthe spectral analysis technique described below to measure element\nabundances.\n2.2 STIS spectra\nOur GO cycle 8 STIS spectra were all obtained with the E140M\ngrating in the ACCUM mode and cover the wavelength range from\n1150 to 1700 A\u02da. All of these echelle STIS spectrogram data were\nprocessed using the IDL-based CALSTIS reduction package devel-\noped and maintained by the STIS instrument development team at\nGoddard Space Flight Centre. A description of the algorithm can be\nfound in Lindler (1999; http:\/\/hires\/stis\/docs\/calstis\/calstis.html).\nThe CALSTIS reduction offers an excellent estimation of the ac-\ntual underlying background to the spectrum and the flux at each\nwavelength, in each spectral order. An estimate of the background\nrequires a proper representation of different contributions to the in-\nterorder signal. Failure to adequately estimate these can lead to both\nsystematic relative and absolute flux errors for both the continuum\nand cores of spectral lines. The interorder signal has contributions\nfrom the dark rate and scattered light from adjacent orders.\nThe CALSTIS reduction package constructs a scattered light model,\nremoves it from the image and then re-extracts the spectrum. This\nprocess is currently accomplished in three iterations. The original\nnet flux produced by CALSTIS is used to create an estimated source\nflux distribution. This is done by correcting each spectral order for\nechelle blaze and merging of the orders. Using this source flux dis-\ntribution, one constructs a model scattered light image incorporat-\ning reference models for the echelle scattering function, telescope\npoint spread function, detector halo, grating isotropic scattering, the\ncross-disperser scatter function and detector ghosts. The iteratively\nderived model scattered light image is subtracted from the original\nFigure 2. 1230\u20131280 A\u02da region of the STIS spectrum of REJ0558\u2212373,\nshowing photospheric absorption lines of N V (1238.821\/1242.804 A\u02da) and\nlarge numbers of Ni lines.

The resulting net spectral image with\nthe scattered light removed, determined for the spectrum for light\nincident within 5 pixels of the spectrum centre, is then used to pro-\nvide the resulting calibrated spectrum, A detailed discussion of this\nprocedure is to appear elsewhere (Bowers & Lindler, in prepara-\ntion). Figs 2 and 3 show sample regions of the STIS spectrum of\nREJ0558\u2212371, illustrating the detection of N V, O V, Si IV and Fe V.\n2.3 Far-UV archival data\nMany high-dispersion far-UV observations of hot DA white dwarfs\nhave now been made with both IUE and HST . A complete exam-\nination of the reprocessed NEWSIPS white dwarf spectra has been\ncarried out by Holberg, Barstow & Sion (1998), examining individ-\nual spectra and co-adding the multiple exposures of particular tar-\ngets. However, while they discussed the detection of photospheric\nspecies, along with interstellar and circumstellar features, and their\nrelative velocities, no abundance measurements were included. HST\nobservations have been made with both the Goddard High Res-\nolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph. In principle, with a much larger effective area and\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatterns in hot DA white dwarfs 873\nmodern electronic detectors, HST achieves a higher signal-to-noise\nratio than IUE, even when the latter spectra are co-added. On the\nother hand, the GHRS wavelength coverage was restricted by the\nspectrometer design, with several separate exposures required at\ndifferent grating angles to observe all photospheric lines of interest.\nSTIS couples a high signal-to-noise ratio with the broad wavelength\ncoverage of the IUE spectra but, apart from the new observations re-\nported in this paper, only a few exposures duplicate what is available\nfrom IUE or the GHRS.\nWe have adopted the following approach to select data from the\nvarious archival sources. If a STIS spectrum is available, we have\ntaken this as the preferred data source (e.g. for G191-B2B, Feige 24,\nGD659, etc.), even if IUE and GHRS data have also been obtained.\nIn some cases, only the sparse wavelength coverage of the GHRS\n(i.e. PG1057, REJ1614) or limited signal-to-noise ratio of IUE (i.e.\nREJ2214, REJ0623, REJ0457, REJ2334, HZ43, etc.) is available.\nMost of the STIS spectra were obtained with the E140M grating,\nwhich gives full wavelength coverage from 1150 to 1700 A\u02da, but a\nfew targets (GD246, PG1123, HZ43 and GD153) were observed\nwith the higher-dispersion E140H grating that, in a single exposure\nfor a particular grating setting, restricts the upper wavelength limit\nto \u223c1350 A\u02da. Therefore, we do not have access to the spectral ranges\ncovering the O V, Si IV and C IV resonance lines in these stars. Good\nco-added IUE spectra do exist for GD246, HZ43 and GD153, which\nwe use to supplement the STIS E140H data. Table 1 summarizes\nall the spectra used for this work. Since, in several cases we are\nusing co-added data sets published by other authors we only give\nthe observation identification for those which are new to this work\nand refer back to the original references for the rest.\n2.4 Optical spectra\nKnowledge of the stellar effective temperature and surface gravity\nare important prerequisites for determining the photospheric abun-\ndances. Values of T eff and log g have been reported by several au-\nthors for all the stars in our sample. Yet, with improvements to model\natmosphere calculations and the need to revise the measurements\nin the light of the stellar composition, it is necessary to repeat this\nwork here using the existing Balmer line spectra. Most of the optical\nspectra we used were obtained as part of a follow-up program of\nspectroscopic observations to characterize the white dwarfs detected\nin the ROSAT soft X-ray and EUV sky survey.\nObservations were undertaken in both the Northern and South-\nern Hemispheres. Southern Hemisphere data were obtained with the\n1.9-m Radcliffe reflector of the South African Astronomical Obser-\nvatory (SAAO), while stars in the Northern Hemisphere were ob-\nserved with the Steward Observatory 2.3-m telescope on Kitt Peak.\nFull details of these have already been published by Marsh et al.\n(1997). The main difference between the Southern and Northern\nHemisphere data is their spectral resolution, 6 and 8 A\u02da (FWHM),\nrespectively. Some of our original Northern Hemisphere spectra did\nnot cover the complete Balmer line series, excluding H\u03b2, owing to\nthe limited size of the charge-coupled device (CCD) chip available\nat the time. Hence, we have supplemented the archival data with\nmore recent observations (GD153, GD394) made using the same\ninstrument but with a larger chip.\n3 M O D E L S T E L L A R AT M O S P H E R E\nC A L C U L AT I O N S\nWe have calculated a new grid of model stellar atmospheres using the\nnon-LTE code TLUSTY (Hubeny & Lanz 1995). These are based on\nwork reported by Lanz et al. (1996) and Barstow, Hubeny & Holberg\n(1998, 1999). In this case we have extended the temperature range\nof the calculations up to 120 000 K, to encompass the hotter DA\nstars included in this analysis. To take account of the higher element\nionization stages that are likely to be encountered in these objects,\nwe have added new ions of O VI, Fe VII\/VIII and Ni VII\/VIII to the\nmodel atoms as well as extending the data for important ions such\nas C IV to include more energy levels. As before, all the calculations\nwere performed in non-LTE with full line-blanketing. We initially\nfixed the abundances of the heavy elements at the values determined\nfrom our earlier analysis of G191-B2B, using homogeneous models\n(He\/H = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125, C\/H = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22127, N\/H = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22127, O\/H =\n9.6 \u00d7 10\u22127, Si\/H = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22127, Fe\/H = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125, Ni\/H =\n5.0 \u00d7 10\u22127), but taking into account that the C IV lines near 1550 A\u02da\nhave subsequently been resolved into multiple components by STIS\n(Bruhweiler et al. 2000).\nIn the spectrum synthesis code SYNSPEC, we have replaced the hy-\ndrogen Stark line broadening tables of Scho\u00a8ning & Butler (private\ncommunication) by the more extended tables of Lemke (1997). The\nlatter allow a more accurate interpolation of the electron density\nfor high-density environments, such as the atmospheres of white\ndwarfs. The spectra produced by the TLUSTY\/SYNSPEC codes were\nrecently extensively tested against the results of Koester\u2019s codes\n(Hubeny & Koester in preparation). The differences in the pre-\ndicted spectra for T eff = 60 000 K and log g = 8 were found to\nbe below 0.5 per cent in the whole UV and optical range. Fur-\nthermore, we have found that the inaccuracy in the interpolations\nof the Scho\u00a8ning & Butler tables, together with some fine details\nof our treatment of the level dissolution, were the primary rea-\nson for the disagreement between the spectroscopically deduced\nT eff using TLUSTY and Koester models obtained by Barstow et al.\n(1998).\n4 DATA A NA LY S I S\n4.1 Measurements of T eff and log g\nThe technique for determining T eff and log g, by comparing the line\nprofiles with the predictions of synthetic spectra is well established\n(see Holberg, Wesemael & Basile 1986; Bergeron, Saffer & Liebert\n1992 and many subsequent authors). We have described our own\nBalmer line analysis technique in several earlier papers (e.g. Barstow\net al. 1994), but we reiterate it briefly here.\nThe T eff and log g measurements were performed using the pro-\ngram XSPEC (Shafer et al. 1991), which adopts a \u03c7 2 minimization\ntechnique to determine the model spectrum giving the best agree-\nment with the data. The four strongest Balmer lines (\u03b2 , \u03b3 , \u03b4, \u03b5) are\nsimultaneously included in the fit and an independent normaliza-\ntion constant applied to each, ensuring that the result is independent\nof the local slope of the continuum and reducing the effect of any\nsystematic errors in the flux calibration of the spectrum.\nWe have established that the apparent T eff and log g values for\nany white dwarf depend on knowledge of the photospheric compo-\nsition of the star (Barstow et al. 1998). Hence, it is necessary to use\na model grid appropriate for a particular star. It is computationally\nunrealistic to produce such grids for a complete range of possible\ncompositions, but Barstow et al. (1998) demonstrated that knowl-\nedge of the exact abundance was a secondary effect. Therefore, for\nthis analysis we computed Balmer line profiles for both pure H\nand G191-B2B heavy-element abundances.

Using a spectral synthesis program such as\nSYNSPEC, abundances can be varied within a narrow range to obtain\nthe values that give the best representation of the data. However, it is\nthen important to confirm the agreement by calculating a complete,\nfully converged, model with the adopted abundances. Although no\nformal goodness of fit is assigned, this approach works reasonably\nwell when there are a small number of absorption features associated\nwith a particular element but becomes much more difficult to use\nwhen there are large numbers of lines for a particular species (e.g.\nFe V or Ni V).\nThe large number of free parameters that need to be considered\nin studying the atmospheres of the heavy-element-rich hot white\ndwarfs has always made a more formal, objective approach diffi-\ncult to develop. Nevertheless, to understand fully the uncertainties\nin abundance measurements it is necessary to apply some kind of\nstatistical analysis technique. In this paper, we fulfil this require-\nment by adapting the spectral fitting technique used to analyse the\nBalmer line spectra to examine the heavy-element features in the\nfar-UV spectra. However, a single high-resolution far-UV spectrum\nhas a large number of data points (\u223c60 000 for the STIS echelle),\nwhich is hard for the XSPEC program to handle. Furthermore, some\nregions of the far-UV spectra contain little useful information, par-\nticularly at longer wavelengths. To solve both these problems we\nsplit the spectra up into smaller sections, selecting wavelength re-\ngions that contain the most useful information. These are listed in\nTable 3, with the dominant species included.\nSynthetic spectra were computed for all these wavelength ranges\nat each value of T eff and log g in the model grid, at the nominal\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatterns in hot DA white dwarfs 875\nTable 3.

The spectral grid was\nthen extended, by scaling the abundances of the main species within\na particular spectral range using the SYNSPEC spectral synthesis pro-\ngram. Models and data were compared using the XSPEC program,\nconsidering one element at a time. When examining a spectral range\ncontaining absorption from more than a single element, the lines of\nany other elements were excluded from the analysis to avoid cou-\npling the abundances together in the spectral fit. For a given star,\nT eff and log g were allowed to vary as free parameters, along with a\nsingle abundance scalefactor, within the 1\u03c3 error ranges allowed by\nthe Balmer analysis. In addition, 3\u03c3 uncertainties were computed\nfor the abundance scalefactors, assuming one degree of freedom.\nAlthough it is more usual to obtain 1\u03c3 errors, it is important to re-\nmember that the latter only correspond to a 68 per cent probability\nthat the true value lies within 1\u03c3 .\nFurthermore, it is more common to determine 3\u03c3 limits on the\nabundances of non-detected elements and a comparison between\nsuch limits and a 3\u03c3 standard error is more meaningful. For refer-\nence, we determined 1\u03c3 errors for a number of the stars and note\nthat these are typically 0.6 times the 3\u03c3 values. Examples of the fits\nto the N V lines of the STIS spectrum of G191-B2B and the noisier\nIUE spectrum of REJ0457\u2212281 are shown in Figs 5 and 6. The\nresults of all the abundance measurements are listed in Table 4.\nThe absence of any entry arises mostly from a lack of data in the\nappropriate spectral range, rather than a true non-detection of these\nelements. However, in the case of PG0948+534 this stems from\nan inability to match the observed line profiles with the calculated\nmodels. We discuss this star in more detail later. Where a particular\nelement was not detected, we set the abundance and lower error\nbound to zero, recording the 3\u03c3 upper limit in the upper error bound\ncolumn.\nFigure 5.

First, we discuss each individual object in the\nsample in isolation, in order of decreasing T eff, noting any peculiari-\nties or problems with the analysis. Secondly, we consider the results\nfor each element across the whole sample. Finally, we examine the\nabundances in a group of the hottest stars in our sample for which we\nhave high signal-to-noise ratio STIS spectra before making general\ncomments concerning the abundance patterns we find.\n5.1 Individual stars\n5.1.1 PG0948+534\nThis is the hottest star in the sample, by some 40 000 K, and the\nonly star where the value we determine for T eff is not significantly\nreduced by the heavy-element line blanketing in the models when\ncompared with previously calculated values (Liebert, private com-\nmunication). While C IV, N V, O V and Si IV are all clearly detected\nby the STIS, any attempt to fit the synthetic spectra to these fea-\ntures produces a poor result. The observed line strengths are much\ngreater than the predictions of even the very highest abundances in\nthe models (100 \u00d7 G191-B2B). Also, the predicted line wings are\nmuch broader than observed. A similar situation is found for the N\nV lines of REJ1032+532 (see Holberg et al. 1999), which is inter-\npreted as arising from the concentration of all the nitrogen present in\nthe outer layers of the stellar atmosphere. The carbon, nitrogen, oxy-\ngen and silicon are probably similarly stratified in PG0948, indeed\npreliminary model calculations support this proposition. However,\nthese models do not fully account for the observed features. We will\nconsider this particular topic in a later paper. At this high tempera-\nture, C III is almost completely ionized and the lines of the typically\nstrong 1170\u20131180 A\u02da 3P\u20133P0 multiplet are not detected. However, we\nare able to fit the Fe V and Ni V lines and measure the abundances\nof these elements.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n876 M.

(1994). In fact, we use the spectrum in-\ncluded in that work for our determination of T eff and log g. However,\nnothing else other than these parameters has been published and our\ncurrent work is the first spectroscopic study of its composition. All\nthe elements considered in this study are detected and the line pro-\nfiles can be matched using the synthetic spectra in the homogeneous\nmodel grid. The value of T eff we determine is 7500 K cooler than\nthe earlier result, which is in keeping with what we would expect in\napplying heavy-element blanketed models rather than pure H ones\n(see Barstow et al. 1998). Our gravity is also approximately 0.3 dex\nlower. There do not appear to be any anomalous abundances in Ton\n21, compared with our reference star, G191-B2B. Therefore, we\ndefer a detailed discussion of the composition to Sections 5.2\u20135.4.\n5.1.3 REJ1738+661\nDiscovered by the ROSAT sky survey, REJ1738+661 was the hottest\nwhite dwarf in the EUV-selected sample (Barstow et al. 1994) and\nmay be associated with an old planetary nebula (Tweedy & Kwit-\nter 1994). Although the nominal value of T eff was reduced from\n\u223c90 000 to \u223c70 000 K, when the Balmer lines were reanalysed\nwith heavy-element blanketed models (Barstow et al. 1998), it re-\nmains one of the hottest objects in our current sample. As with Ton\n21, the range of models in the synthetic spectral grids can fit all the\nheavy-element lines present and no unusual abundances are found.\n5.1.4 PG1342+444\nPG1342+444 is the only star in our sample for which neither IUE\nnor HST spectra are available. However, we do have a FUSE spec-\ntrum of the object, which has been the subject of an earlier analysis\n(Barstow et al. 2002). For the present work we adopted the values\nof T eff and log g determined from the Balmer rather than the Lyman\nlines, which give an unexpectedly lower value (Barstow et al. 2001c,\n2002). In the original discussion, we used the argument that good\nagreement between the C abundances obtained from C III and C IV\nlines, respectively, favoured the higher temperature. However, with\nthe more rigorous statistical treatment applied here, it can be seen\nthat the uncertainties in the abundance measurements are large and\nof a similar magnitude to the reported abundance discrepancies for\nthe Lyman-determined temperature. In general, the earlier result of\nphotospheric abundances up to an order of magnitude greater than\nthose found for G191-B2B holds, despite the large measurement\nuncertainties.\n5.1.5 REJ2214\u2212492\nThis is the brightest of several hot, heavy-element-rich white dwarfs\ndiscovered by the ROSAT WFC, which appeared to be very simi-\nlar to G191-B2B (Holberg et al. 1993, 1994). Initial abundances\ndetermined from the co-added IUE spectra appeared to be slightly\nhigher than for G191-B2B, but these results depend on the assumed\ntemperature, which has subsequently been revised downwards us-\ning improved optical spectra and heavy-element blanketed models\n(Barstow et al. 1998). In the present study C, O, Fe and Ni seem to\nbe enhanced when compared with G191-B2B.\n5.1.6 Feige 24\nFeige 24 is a well-studied hot, heavy-element-rich white dwarf, very\nsimilar to G191-B2B and the STIS observation has already been re-\nported by Vennes et al. (2000) and Vennes & Lanz (2001). Feige 24\nis the only known close binary in the sample. The analysis of Vennes\n& Lanz reports that the average heavy-element abundance in Feige\n24 is 0.17 dex larger than for G191-B2B, apart from carbon, which\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n878 M.

However, we find little differ-\nence between the abundances of Feige 24 and G191-B2B, within\nthe formal errors of our analysis (Fig. 7). Indeed, the abundances\nmeasured from C IV, N V and Fe V are in very close agreement. Only\nthe Si and Ni abundances disagree by amounts greater than the 3\u03c3\nuncertainties. We note that the measured abundances are sensitive\nto the adopted temperature. Our value of 60 500 K is \u223c3000 K hot-\nter than that of Vennes & Lanz, which may explain the difference\nbetween these results.\n5.1.7 REJ0558\u2212367\nThe current paper represents the first detailed analysis of the element\nabundances, apart from the preliminary work reported by Barstow\net al. (2001b). It has a similar composition to G191-B2B.\n5.1.8 WD2218+706\nThis object has also been discussed in some detail individually\n(Barstow et al. 2001a) and is known to have a planetary nebula.\nUnlike any of the other white dwarfs in the sample, the STIS spec-\ntrum reveals a trace of He II at 1640 A\u02da. Hence, this white dwarf\nis a DAO, although the He abundance is too low to be detected at\n4686 A\u02da, in the visible band. This may be related to the fact that this\nstar has the lowest gravity (7.05) and mass (0.45\u20130.5 M\n) of any\nin the current sample. There is currently no evidence for a binary\ncompanion. The first analysis indicated that N and O were enhanced\ncompared with G191-B2B, with the other element abundances lying\nwithin a factor of 2. However, only O seems to be significantly more\nabundant in the current work.\n5.1.9 REJ0623\u2212371\nREJ0623\u2212371 is another G191-B2B analogue discovered by\nROSAT (Holberg et al. 1993). The abundances measured here seem\nto be similar to those of G191-B2B.\n5.1.10 PG1123+189\nThis white dwarf is a member of a group of objects that contain lower\nheavy-element abundances than the G191-B2B-like group, on the\nbasis of its EUV flux (see Wolff et al. 1998). However, the E140H\nechelle spectrum included in this work has limited spectral coverage\n(1170\u20131360 A\u02da), including only N V and Ni V lines. Nitrogen is\nnot detected, but Ni appears to be present. Optical spectroscopy\nby Schmidt & Smith (1995) reveals a cool companion longward of\n6000 A\u02da. Radial velocity measurements (Saffer, Livio & Yungelson\n1998) indicate that the pair are not close.\n5.1.11 REJ2334\u2212471\nAnother ROSAT heavy-element-rich discovery, fainter than both\nREJ2214\u2212492 and REJ0623\u2212371, the co-added IUE spectrum has\na lower signal-to-noise ratio than these visually brighter stars. Sur-\nprisingly, no detailed analysis of this data has been published pre-\nviously, although the detection of C IV, N V and Si IV are noted by\nHolberg et al. (1998). We confirm the presence of these features\nand obtain limits on the abundance of O, Fe and Ni. Interestingly,\nthe best-fitting model yields a finite abundance of Fe at a level \u223c10\ntimes the \u22123\u03c3 error bar. As no individual Fe lines can be positively\ndetected, it seems likely that their strength is very similar to the\nnoise level.\n5.1.12 G191-B2B\nG191-B2B is the visually brightest and the best studied of all hot\nwhite dwarfs. It has been observed in many wavebands, providing\na calibration standard and reference against which we compare all\nrelated objects, as can be seen in the above sections. Far-UV abun-\ndance measurements have been reported by many authors, using\nIUE, FOS, GHRS and STIS spectra (e.g. Vennes et al. 1992; Sion\net al. 1992; Vidal-Madjar et al. 1994; Vennes & Lanz 2001). Nev-\nertheless, the star continues to spring a few surprises. Bruhweiler\net al. (2000) and Vennes & Lanz note that the C IV resonance doublet\nnear 1550 A\u02da has an additional component that is blueshifted with\nrespect to the photospheric velocity. The nature of the component\nis not important for this discussion and will be reported elsewhere\n(Bannister et al. 2003). However, it has led to erroneously high\nestimates of the C abundances based on IUE spectra, where the\ncomponents cannot be resolved. Consequently, all C abundances\nbased on C IV lines observed by IUE should be treated with caution.\nThe importance of this new measurement of the photospheric\nabundances for G191-B2B is the application of the objective tech-\nnique outlined in this paper and the formal errors that can be derived.\nComparing these results with the recent analysis of Vennes & Lanz\n(2001) shows a reasonable agreement. The values we obtain are not\nprecisely the same, but are more or less consistent within the overall\nuncertainties imposed by the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra and\nthe possible range of adopted temperatures.\n5.1.13 HS1234+481\nLittle is known concerning the photospheric abundance pattern in\nthis star. Jordan, Koester & Finley (1996) have reported the detection\nof Fe in the EUVE spectrum. Unfortunately, the single IUE echelle\nspectrum is too noisy to reveal very much and no heavy-element\ndetections can be reported. The upper limits are included in Table 4\nfor completeness, but the error bars are too large to provide any\nuseful information. Consequently, this star is not included in any\nfurther analysis or discussion of the sample.\n5.1.14 GD246\nVennes, Thejll & Shipman (1991) reported the presence of the C\nIV, N V and Si IV resonance lines and derived abundances for these\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatterns in hot DA white dwarfs 879\nelements. However, the co-added IUE spectrum does not reveal the\nN features (Holberg et al. 1998). They are weak, but are detected in\nthe STIS E140H echelle data. We are only able to place upper limits\non the presence of O, Fe and Ni. However, Vennes & Dupuis (2002)\nreport the detection of Fe VI features in the Chandra spectrum of\nthis star.\nWhile we can obtain abundances for both N and Si, our analysis\nof the C IV doublet poses a problem. It is not possible to match the\nstrength and shape of the observed features with the model spectra.\nGiven, the good agreement achieved for most of the stars we have\nstudied, this is a surprise and reminiscent of the problem encountered\nfor all the resonance lines detected in PG0948+534 and discussed\nabove. This suggests that the C IV lines contain a second absorbing\ncomponent, in addition to the photospheric material, which is not\nresolved by the IUE or more recent STIS E140M spectra. This\nproblem would not have been noted by Vennes et al. (1991), as their\nabundance analysis was based on measurements of equivalent width\nrather than line profile fitting.\n5.1.15 REJ0457\u2212281\nMultiwavelength observations of the star indicate that is it very\nsimilar to G191-B2B. However, the co-added IUE spectrum reveals\nonly C, N and Si lines (see Holberg et al. 1998) and O, Fe and\nNi have not been detected. However, the upper limits we obtain\nare consistent with the star having the same abundances of these\nelements as G191-B2B, the noise level in the spectrum being similar\nto the predicted line strengths. Bannister et al. (2003) note that the\nC IV doublet has a blueshifted component, as in G191-B2B, but the\nvelocity separation is larger and the lines are well resolved.\n5.1.16 HZ43\nHZ43 is well known as a pure H-atmosphere white dwarf. It is rela-\ntively hot at 50 400 K, only \u223c2000 K cooler than G191-B2B. Hence,\nit is a surprise that no sources of photospheric opacity have been\ndetected in the soft X-ray, EUV, far-UV and visible observations and\nonly upper limits to abundances are obtained (e.g. Napiwotzki et al.\n1993; Barstow et al. 1995). Our analysis includes both the earlier\nIUE data and a recent high signal-to-noise ratio STIS E140H spec-\ntrum recorded for the purpose of studying the interstellar deuterium\nand covering \u223c1170\u20131360 A\u02da. No photospheric heavy elements are\ndetected in the STIS spectrum. However, we provide an objective\ndetermination of the upper limits to the abundances for the first time.\nWe note that Dupuis et al. (1998) report upper limits on C, N and O\nfrom ORFEUS data, which are similar to those derived here.\n5.1.17 REJ2156\u2212546\nEUV studies of this star indicate that it has a pure H atmosphere\n(Barstow et al. 1997). Its primary interest for far-UV observa-\ntions has been as a background source for exploring the interstellar\nmedium, particularly as the EUV spectrum indicates that the line\nof sight is significantly ionized (Barstow et al. 1997). The STIS\nE140M spectrum largely confirms the absence of photospheric ma-\nterial, although there appears to be a weak detection of the shorter-\nwavelength component of the C IV doublet.\n5.1.18 REJ1032+532\nThis object is an interesting contrast to REJ2156\u2212546. Although\ntheir temperatures and gravities are almost identical, the STIS\nE140M spectrum of REJ1032+532 reveals photospheric lines of\nC III, C IV, N V, Si III and Si IV (Holberg et al. 1999). However,\nthe EUV spectrum indicates that the atmosphere is pure hydrogen\n(Barstow et al. 1997). As discussed by Holberg et al. (1999), this\ndiscrepancy can be explained if the nitrogen is not homogeneously\nmixed in the atmosphere but stratified, residing mainly in the outer-\nmost regions of the atmosphere. The nitrogen abundance in Table 4\nis, therefore, derived from the stratified model of Holberg et al.\nWe also note that, although we formally find a good fit to the C IV\nlines, the models cannot quite reproduce the cores, indicating that\nthe carbon may also be stratified to a degree.\n5.1.19 PG1057+719\nPG1057+719 was observed by the GHRS, with several central\nwavelength settings yielding coverage of C IV, N V, Si IV, Fe and Ni,\nbut not C III or O V (Holberg et al. 1997). No heavy elements were\ndetected in this star and our analysis provides just upper limits.\n5.1.20 GD394\nThe nature of the far-UV opacity observed in GD394 was the subject\nof some uncertainty for a while. However, this issue was resolved\nby Barstow et al. (1996), concluding that the observed Si is photo-\nspheric. No other elements are detected in the IUE or GHRS spectra,\nalthough the EUV spectrum indicates that there is a greater photo-\nspheric opacity than can be accounted for by Si alone. Subsequently,\nChayer et al. (2000) have detected Fe III in FUSE data, while Dupuis\net al. (2000) found the white dwarf to be photometrically variable\nin the EUV and observed an extreme abundance of Si in the optical\nrange. Episodic accretion is proposed as the origin of a large EUV\ndark spot on the surface, which may also explain the anomalous\nSi abundance. In any interpretation of the existing far-UV data, the\npossibility that the features are time-averaged over the 1.150-d EUV\ncycle or may be variable in other ways must be taken into account. At\nthe moment the sources of the accreted material remains unknown.\n5.1.21 GD153\nA pure H-atmosphere white dwarf that is often used as a calibration\nsource, GD153 was observed by the STIS 140H echelle for the\npurpose of studying interstellar deuterium. No photospheric heavy\nelements are detected in this star.\n5.1.22 REJ1614\u2212085\nA close twin to PG1057+719, REJ1614\u2212085 was observed as part\nof the same GHRS programme (Holberg et al. 1997). In contrast to\nPG1057+710, photospheric heavy elements were detected in this\nstar. Our current analysis provides revised abundance measurements\nfor C, N and Si, together with upper limits for Fe and Ni. Infrared\nspectroscopy from 1 to 2.5 \u00b5m by Burleigh et al. (2003) rules out\nthe presence of any cool companion earlier than M7V.\n5.1.23 GD659\nHeavy elements detected in the IUE spectrum were originally at-\ntributed to circumstellar material (Holberg et al. 1995). A more\nrecent measurement of the stellar radial velocity indicates that the\nobserved features are in fact photospheric. This poses an interest-\ning problem, since the EUV spectrum shows a pure H atmosphere\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n880 M. A. Barstow et al.\n(Barstow et al. 1997). Furthermore, a good fit to the N V lines can-\nnot be achieved with our models. It appears that GD659 has a strat-\nified N component, as for REJ1032+532. Therefore, the N abun-\ndance listed in Table 4 was determined under this assumption (as for\nREJ1032+532). We note that the \u2018circumstellar\u2019 C, N and Si lines\nlisted for this star in Holberg et al. (1998) are incorrectly attributed\nand should be included in the \u2018photospheric\u2019 list.\n5.1.24 EG102\nThis star is often used as a flux standard. Vennes et al. (1991) reported\nthe first detection of Si II in this star. Holberg et al. (1998) note that\nphotospheric Al is also present. A strong C II line at 1335 A\u02da is\nconsidered to be circumstellar. Magnesium has also been detected\nat visible wavelengths. The short downward diffusion time for Mg\nand Al would indicate that the object is undergoing accretion from\nan unknown source. In this paper, we have not generally included\nMg and Al in the models and only report our measurement of the Si\nabundance.\n5.1.25 Wolf 1346\nAt 19 200 K, Wolf 1346 is the coolest star in our sample. Detection\nof Si II was first reported by Bruhweiler & Kondo (1983) and the\nphotospheric origin of the lines was confirmed by Holberg et al.\n(1996).\n5.2 Observed patterns of element abundances\nThe spectral analysis presented in this paper has obtained measure-\nments of DA white dwarf atmosphere heavy-element abundances in\na uniform way. While the spectra do not necessarily have a uniform\nFigure 8. Measured abundances of carbon (by number with respect to hydrogen) as a function of T eff for both C III (filled diamonds) and C IV (open squares)\nlines.\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the error bars on the measurements have been\ndetermined with a full statistical treatment and also take account of\nuncertainties in adopted parameters such as T eff and log g. There-\nfore, this represents the most comprehensive and self-consistent\ndata set available for studying how the atmospheric compositions\nof hot DA white dwarfs evolve, varying with age and mass. For the\npurposes of this discussion we use the parameters we can measure\ndirectly, T eff and log g, as proxies for those in Figs 8\u201317 , where we\nshow the measured abundances and upper limits for each element\nin turn. Generally, a much stronger relationship between abundance\nand temperature is seen than for gravity. Hence, most of the fol-\nlowing discussion will concentrate on Figs 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16,\nconsidering each element in turn.\n5.2.1 Carbon\nAbundances of carbon have been derived from measurements of C\nIII and C IV lines separately for most stars and these are displayed\ntogether in Figs 8 and 9 to allow a direct comparison. In some\nobservations, with restricted wavelength coverage, only C IV was\navailable. For individual stars, the two different measurements are\nlargely in agreement, within the observational uncertainties. How-\never, in the hottest group, there seems to be a systematic difference\nwith the C IV measurements yielding larger abundances than for C\nIII. This might reflect a problem with the ionization balance, arising\nfrom the models themselves or an inappropriate choice of temper-\nature. Alternatively, the respective lines may be sampling different\natmospheric depths and, therefore, revealing the underlying carbon\ndistribution.\nAs expected from our existing general understanding of how the\ncomposition evolves as white dwarfs cool, carbon is present in all\nthe hottest stars and disappears from the atmosphere of many at\ntemperatures below \u223c50 000 K.

Apart from REJ2156\u2212546\nthe levels are very similar to those found in the higher-temperature\nobjects. In REJ2156\u2212546, the carbon is only just detectable and the\nabundance is one to two orders of magnitude below the typical range.\nAt 35 700 K, GD659 is the lowest-temperature object in the sam-\nple in which carbon is detected, but only EG102 and Wolf1346, at\n\u223c20 000 K, are cooler. Furthermore, the upper limits on the abun-\ndances exceed the values measured for other stars.\nIt has been clear for some time that the predictions of radia-\ntive levitation calculations, such as those of Chayer, Fontaine &\nWesemael (1995a) and Chayer et al. (1994, 1995b) that are not in-\ncluded self-consistently in a model atmosphere calculation are of\nlimited use.

More recent, self-consistent treat-\nments, such as those developed by Dreizler & Wolff (1999) and\nSchuh, Dreizler & Wolff (2002) have only been applied to EUV\nspectra and nothing has yet been published that we can compare\nwith the UV data discussed here. Hence, the work of Chayer et al.\n(1994, 1995a,b) still represents the best reference point, for the time\nbeing.\nIf we compare the data of Fig. 8 with the predicted run of abun-\ndance with temperature in Chayer et al.

However, the abundances measured for three stars with T eff\nbelow 50 000 K (REJ1032+532, REJ1614\u2212085 and GD659) are\nhigher than any other measurements.

Again, there appears to be a division of the cooler stars into two\ngroups, with and without N in their atmospheres. Interestingly, there\nis a hint of a divergence between 50 000 and 55 000 K where three ob-\njects show a clear trend of decreasing abundance with temperature,\nwhile two others have abundances similar to the higher-temperature\nstars.\n5.2.3 Oxygen\nThe abundances of oxygen (Figs 12 and 13) are based on detection\nof the O V line. Hence, at the lower temperatures, where this feature\nis difficult to excite, the upper limits on the oxygen abundance are\nnot very informative. Of the three stars showing C and N in this\nrange only REJ1032+532 has a detection. However, the wavelength\nrange of the REJ1614\u2212085 observation did not include O V. It is\nimportant to note that there are no detections of O IV lines in those\nspectra where O V is not seen, although we do not quote formal\nabundance limits for these. No trends of abundance with temperature\nor gravity are noted. There is a general tendency to have more non-\ndetections for higher-gravity stars (also for C and N), but gravity\nincreases as white dwarfs evolve to lower temperature and this may\njust reflect that trend. The radiative levitation calculations predict\nthat oxygen should disappear from the white dwarf atmospheres at\nhigher temperatures than either C or N, which is consistent with our\nresults.\n5.2.4 Silicon\nThe variation of abundance with temperature (Fig. 14) is very strik-\ning for silicon. The highest values are observed for the hottest stars,\nbut there is then a strong decline in abundance from \u223c55 000 down\nto \u223c40 000 K, with the exception of GD394, which contains an\nabundance similar to that of the hottest stars. However, we should\nprobably discount GD394 from this discussion because of its known\npeculiarities (Dupuis et al. 2000). There is a hint of a rise in the Si\nabundance at temperatures below 40 000 K. However, the error bars\nof the Si abundance measurements are very large for these cooler\nobjects. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that Si is the only\ndetected element, among those included in this study, in the two\ncoolest stars in the sample.\nIn their calculations, Chayer et al. (1995b) do predict a minimum\nin the abundance of Si, but at \u223c70 000 K, some 30 000 K hotter\nthan is observed here, if indeed we have observed a true minimum.\nEarlier discussions of the detection of Si in Wolf1346 and EG102\n(Holberg et al. 1996, 1997) also include reference to the presence\nof Al and Mg. While the presence of Si can be readily accounted\nfor by the radiative levitation calculations, Al and Mg should have\ndisappeared from the photospheres of these two stars, indicating\nthat there is ongoing accretion from some source. Such accretion\nmay also be contributing to the photospheric Si.\n5.2.5 Iron and nickel\nWe have displayed the measured abundances of iron and nickel\ntogether in Figs 16 and 17 to allow easy comparison of measure-\nments for the only two iron group elements detected in the stars in\nthis sample. While there have been hints of the presence of other\nFe-group elements, such as Cr (Holberg et al. 1994), definite detec-\ntions have yet to be reported. It is clear from both Figs 16 and 17 that\nthe abundances of Fe and Ni track each other very closely. Fig. 18\nshows the ratio of the Fe:Ni abundances as a function of T eff for all\nthose stars where both elements are detected. As the errors on the\nindividual abundance measurements are not symmetrical, about the\nabundance value, we estimate the uncertainties in the ratio calcu-\nlation by considering the possible extremes of the Fe\/Ni ratio (i.e.\nFe value+3\u03c3 \/Ni value\u22123\u03c3 , Fe value\u22123\u03c3 \/Ni value+3\u03c3 ).

Below \u223c50 000 K, neither of these\nelements is detected in any star in our sample. In contrast, all stars\nin the upper temperature range show both elements, with a fairly\nsmall scatter in abundances encompassed largely by the measure-\nment uncertainties. Fig. 17 shows a trend for decreasing Fe and\nNi abundance with increasing gravity. Variations in log g between\nindividual stars could largely account for the scatter observed in\nthe Fig. 18 abundance versus temperature plot. We need to be a\nlittle cautious in interpreting the non-detection of Fe and Ni below\n50 000 K, since Fe III has been detected in GD394 by FUSE, at\nshorter wavelengths than covered by the spectra discussed in this\npaper (Chayer et al. 2000). Our observations could be explained by\nthe absence of transitions of lower ionization stages in the HST and\nIUE wavebands rather than a lack of Fe or Ni in the white dwarf\natmospheres. However, as discussed earlier, GD394 has some pe-\nculiarities and this argument cannot explain the non-detections of\nFe and Ni in T eff \u223c 50 000 K stars such as HZ43.\n5.3 STIS observations of stars with T eff > 50000 K\nThe STIS instrument on HST has provided the best signal-to-noise\nratio data utilized in this study. As a result, for those stars where STIS\nspectra are available, the abundance measurements uncertainties are\nmuch smaller than for the IUE observations. Consequently, it is a\nuseful exercise to treat these stars as a high-quality subsample in\nwhich we might see systematic evolutionary trends. We restrict this\nanalysis to those stars where all the elements considered here have\nbeen detected. In Fig. 19, we show the abundances measured for\neach element for a total of seven stars. The results are not very\nconclusive as, even with these most accurate measurements, the\nerror bars overlap substantially. It would be reasonable to say that,\nwithin the measurement uncertainties, the observed abundances are\nthe same in each star. Therefore, we are unable to detect a trend\nrelated to white dwarf cooling, as has been reported by Vennes &\nFigure 19. Comparison of measured abundances for all elements included\nin this study for all stars hotter than 50 000 K observed by STIS.\nLanz (2001) for Feige 24 and G191-B2B. Nevertheless, there are\nsome weak general features to note. The measured abundances in\nWD2218+706 are the highest in the sample for most elements,\nwhereas those for REJ1738+665 are the lowest. It is most likely\nthat we are seeing a gravity effect, since WD2218+706 has by far\nthe lowest surface gravity in the sample and REJ1738+665 has the\nhighest surface gravity in this group.\n6 D I S C U S S I O N\nIn Section 5 we have presented a complex analysis of the measured\nabundance of heavy elements for 25 hot DA white dwarfs observed\nat high spectral resolution in the far-UV. This sample represents the\nmost complete survey yet published of the evolution of the compo-\nsition as white dwarfs cool. In particular, we have examined how\nthe abundances of key elements vary with stellar temperature and\ngravity, compared these results with the predictions of radiative lev-\nitation calculations and studied particular important subgroups of\nstars.\nA key element of this study has been the careful objective ap-\nproach taken to measure abundances with all available lines (or\nmost for Fe and Ni) of a particular species treated simultaneously,\nusing a \u03c72 goodness of fit, as described in Section 4. This provides\na firm statistical basis for determining the measurement uncertain-\nties on which much of the analysis (Section 5) and the discussion\nin this section is based. Importantly, it allows us to treat the non-\nuniformity of the signal-to-noise ratio in the observations correctly,\nparticularly when comparing IUE and HST data. The sizes of the\nuncertainties in the abundance measurements place clear limits on\ntheir interpretation and sometime make it difficult to draw substan-\ntial and interesting conclusions. Nevertheless, some important key\nresults have emerged. We reiterate each of these in turn below and\nthen discuss them further in the subsequent subsections.\n6.1 Summary of results\n(i) The presence or absence of heavy elements in the hot DA\nwhite dwarfs largely reflects what would be expected if radiative\nlevitation is the supporting mechanism.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatterns in hot DA white dwarfs 887\n(ii) The measured abundances do not match the predicted values\nvery well.\n(iii) While all stars hotter than \u223c50 000 K contain heavy el-\nements, as expected, there is an unexplained dichotomy at lower\ntemperatures with some stars having apparently pure H envelopes\nand others having detectable quantities of heavy elements.\n(iv) Where heavy elements are present in stars with T eff below\n50 000 K, they are often stratified, lying in the outermost layers of\nthe envelope.\n(v) When detected, the Fe and Ni abundances maintain an ap-\nproximately constant ratio, close to the cosmic value of \u223c20.\n(vi) For most of the hottest white dwarfs, the spread in element\nabundances is quite narrow and similar to the abundances measured\nin G191-B2B.\n(vii) A few strong temperature\/evolutionary effects are seen in\nthe abundance measurements. These are: decreasing Si abundance\nwith temperature. An N abundance split into two groups at lower\ntemperature (see also iii). A sharp decline in Fe and Ni abundance\nto zero, below \u223c50 000 K.\n(viii) For the hottest white dwarfs observed by STIS, the\nstrongest determinant of abundance appears to be gravity.\n6.1.1 Radiative levitation and element abundances\nThe role of radiative levitation as a mechanism for supporting heavy\nelements in a white dwarf atmosphere against the downward force\nof gravity is well established and we have discussed the most recent\nkey papers by Chayer et al. (1994, 1995a,b) earlier in this paper. The\ngeneral pattern of EUV opacity with stellar temperature and grav-\nity, mapped out by photometric observations, has provided strong\nsupporting evidence (e.g. Barstow et al. 1993; Marsh et al. 1997;\nVennes et al. 1996). Conversely, the predicted abundances have usu-\nally been in conflict with measured values (e.g. Holberg et al. 1993;\nHolberg et al. 1994; Chayer et al. 1994, 1995a,b). The work reported\nhere underlines this very strongly.\nChayer et al. have acknowledged that there are deficiencies in\ntheir theoretical framework. More recently Dreizler & Wolff (1999)\nand Schuh et al. (2002) have made improvements in the approach by\nincorporating the radiative levitation calculations self-consistently\ninto their atmosphere code. In particular, Schuh et al. have been\nvery successful in matching the observed EUVE spectra of a sam-\nple of stars with synthetic spectra, using just T eff and log g as the\nfree parameters, from which the element abundances are determined\nwithin the models. From this work they derive a metallicity param-\neter, which shows a general decrease with decreasing temperature.\nHowever, there remain some potential problems and limitations.\nFirst, the values of T eff and log g determined from their fits are\nnot consistent with those measured independently from the Balmer\nlines. Secondly, the metallicity of stars that are quite different in\nappearance in the UV (e.g. REJ2156\u2212546 and REJ1032+532) is\nfound to be the similar from the EUV analyses. Thirdly, these new\nself-consistent models have yet to be tested against the high spec-\ntral resolution far-UV data, which contain much more detail than\nthe EUV spectra.\n6.1.2 Additional abundance-altering mechanisms?\nThe key result that must be explained by any new theoretical work\nis our observation of the different heavy-element abundance lev-\nels in otherwise similar stars below \u223c50 000 K. This is in contrast\nto the fairly uniform abundances seen at higher temperatures. This\nmight in part be explained by uncertainties in the various mea-\nsurements, but there are striking examples of pairs of stars (e.g.\nRE2156\u2212546\/REJ1032+532; REJ1614\u2212084\/GD153), where the\ndifference in abundance is well outside these possible errors. It\nseems likely that some additional effect (or effects), over and above\nradiative levitation, is (are) at play here. There are several possibil-\nities that must be considered, which might operate individually or\nin some combination.\nIn some stars, material might be being accreted from a companion,\nfrom the ISM or from previously ejected stellar material. The strat-\nification effects seen in REJ1032+532, REJ1614\u2212085 and GD659\nwould lend support to this idea. However, only REJ1032+532\nhas been noted as a possible member of a binary system\n(Holberg et al. 1999). Furthermore, EUV spectroscopy shows that\nboth REJ1032+532 and GD659 lie in low-density regions of the\nISM, indicating that the accretion from the ISM will not be signifi-\ncant. Evidence for circumstellar material has been seen in some of\nthe hottest white dwarfs and such features are seen in REJ1614\u2212085\n(Bannister et al. 2003). There is also a weak detection in GD659,\nbut nothing is seen in REJ1032+532. While, we cannot identify a\nclear single explanation that might work for all three stars, there are\npossible mechanisms for each.\n6.1.3 Why do some white dwarfs have pure H envelopes?\nCoupled with the above discussion is the need to explain the ex-\nistence of a number of stars that do not contain heavy elements in\ntheir photosphere: HZ43, GD153 and PG1057+719. The radiative\nlevitation calculations and the fact that other stars with a similar\ntemperature and gravity do have such photospheric material is a\nproblem. Some of the mechanisms discussed in Section 6.1.2 might\nexplain the differences between the pure H and metal-containing\ngroups, but it is also important to examine the possibility that the\npure H stars instead may be peculiar in some way. All the radiative\nlevitation and diffusion calculations assume the presence of a reser-\nvoir of heavy elements and uniformly distributed abundances are\nusually the starting point. However, there is no a priori proof that\nsuch a reservoir must be present. For most white dwarfs, nuclear\nfusion products are limited to nothing more massive than C and O.\nHence, all heavier elements (and probably N) must be derived from\nthe composition of the progenitor. Since all the white dwarfs studied\nhere are local disc objects it seems very unlikely that any of the pro-\ngenitors could have been metal-poor. Therefore, we need to look for\na mechanism that depletes the heavy-element reservoir. Mass loss\nthrough a wind might do this. However, for radiatively driven winds,\nmass loss should be lower in the pure-H stars than those containing\nheavy elements, because the wind is driven by metal lines.\n6.1.4 The scope of the DA sample\nThe sample of 25 white dwarfs assembled here is the largest for\nwhich high-resolution far-UV spectra have been examined in such\ndetail. Nevertheless, it has a number of limitations. First, it is an as-\nsembly of small groups of observations from a number of separate\nprograms. These have used different instruments, yielding a range of\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and some have incomplete spectral coverage.\nSecondly, the target selection criteria have been very non-uniform.\nHence, the sample is not necessarily representative of the DA popu-\nlation as a whole. For example, many of the IUE observations were\nobtained as part of a project to identify heavy elements in stars al-\nready known to have strong EUV opacity and those appearing as\npure H atmosphere in the EUV were ignored. Interestingly, the STIS\nobservations of those key objects in our discussion, REJ2156\u2212546,\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n888 M. A. Barstow et al.\nREJ1032+532 and GD659, were part of a program to study the\nlocal ISM. Without these spectra, the abundance dichotomy we ob-\nserve below 50 000 K would be much less clear, relying just on\nREJ1614\u2212085, which might easily have been dismissed as a sin-\ngle peculiarity. Of course, with only small numbers and a rather\nbiased selection, we do not know whether or not REJ1032+532,\nREJ1614\u2212085 and GD659 are typical of DAs in this temperature\nrange or whether true pure H envelopes such as GD153 and HZ43\nare \u2018normal\u2019.\n6.1.5 The scope of the far-UV observations\nThese far-UV spectra represent the most detailed information avail-\nable in any spectral range for these stars. However, they do not\nnecessarily tell the whole story. For example, for the coolest white\ndwarfs the N V lines will not be excited and there are no other ni-\ntrogen transitions in the 1150\u20131900 A\u02da range. Hence, nitrogen could\nbe present but not detected for this reason. Observations at shorter\nwavelengths, in the FUSE band, provide access to some lower ion-\nization stages of N and other elements. Fe III has been detected in\nthe FUSE spectrum of GD394 (Chayer et al. 2000) but only higher\nionization stages of Fe are present in the longer-wavelength spectra.\nWe have also invoked our knowledge of the EUV spectra of some\nstars in interpreting the observations presented here. Without this\ndata, we would have a rather different view of some of the stars in\nour study. It is clear then, that a multiwavelength approach, of which\nfar-UV spectra are an essential part, is the only way of completely\nunderstanding the complexities of individual stars.\nWe have drawn data from two major UV telescopes, IUE and\nHST . However, it is of variable quality. The spectral resolution of\nthe IUE is approximately three to four times poorer than that of the\nHST M gratings of the GHRS and STIS instruments. The circum-\nstellar material detected in some objects such as G191-B2B (see,\ne.g., Bannister et al. 2003) would not have been separated from the\nphotospheric lines at the resolution of IUE. Had they been observed\nby IUE, it is likely that we would have reported higher abundances\nthan are tabulated in this paper. Only in REJ0457\u2212281 have cir-\ncumstellar absorption components been detected and resolved by\nIUE. Therefore, we should be concerned as to whether or not un-\ndetected components may be present in other stars observed only\nby IUE, such as REJ2214\u2212492 and REJ0623\u2212371. In fact, we\ncannot necessarily assume that all such components have been re-\nsolved by the STIS E140M grating. For example, the circumstellar\nmaterial in G191-B2B was barely resolved in the C IV lines. Prob-\nlems in fitting model atmosphere line profiles to the observations of\nGD246 and PG0948+534 could indicate that there is circumstellar\nmaterial present, but no direct evidence for any multiple absorp-\ntion components is found by Bannister et al. (2003). Therefore, if\npresent, circumstellar material must lie at a velocity so close to\nthat of the photosphere that it is beyond present spectral resolution\ncapabilities.\n6.1.6 Scope of the models\nAll the results presented here depend on the stellar model atmo-\nsphere calculations and the detailed physics and atomic data in-\ncluded therein. However, all model calculations have some limita-\ntions, none are perfect. Better treatments of particular parts of the\nproblem are being developed all the time. Indeed, even the TLUSTY\ncode used here has undergone further recent development. It would\nbe hugely time consuming and probably unnecessary to repeat our\nanalysis for each new generation of the codes. What is most im-\nportant is that the analyses have been carried out using models\ncalculated with the same version of the program. Therefore, the\ninternal comparison of abundances on an object-by-object basis is\nvalid. Furthermore, it is clear from this work that, even with the\nbest quality spectra, the statistical uncertainties in the abundance\nmeasurements are significant. At the moment, they are probably the\ndominant limitation of this work, rather than the model systematics.\n6.1.7 Other limitations of the analysis\nWhile we have tried to improve the objectivity of the stellar abun-\ndance measurements, with the statistical technique employed. There\nremain several limitations that cannot be ignored. For example, we\nhave only considered the statistical errors in the analysis and failed\nto consider any systematic effects. For example, it is clear from\nwork published in several papers that the actual uncertainties in\nmeasurements of T eff and log g are larger than the statistical values\nreported (e.g. Napiwotzki et al. 1999; Barstow et al. 2001c). More-\nover, we have made necessary simplifying assumptions concerning\nthe general composition of the stars when carrying out the Balmer\nline analysis. Ultimately, the study of any individual star needs to\nbe completely self-consistent, where the model of the appropriate\nabundance is used for the Balmer line work. Furthermore, in all\nour analyses, we have just dealt with a single species at any one\ntime. However, it would be much better to deal simultaneously with\nall ionization stages of an atom and even with all atoms together.\nThe consequence of these limitations is that the true abundance un-\ncertainties are larger than the values that we quote here, although\nthe fact that we quote 3\u03c3 values, rather than the standard 1\u03c3 errors,\nwill mitigate this to some extent. A completely self-consistent abun-\ndance, temperature and gravity analysis is the ideal, but beyond the\ncomputational scope of current resources.\n7 C O N C L U S I O N\nWe have reported a series of systematic abundance measurements\nfor a group of hot DA white dwarfs in the temperature range\n20 000\u2013110 000 K, based on far-UV spectroscopy with HST , IUE\nand FUSE. Using our latest heavy-element blanketed non-LTE stel-\nlar atmosphere calculations we have addressed the heavy-element\nabundance patterns making completely objective measurements of\nabundance values and upper limits using a \u03c7 2 fitting technique.\nWe find that the presence or absence of heavy elements in the hot\nDA white dwarfs largely reflects what would be expected if radia-\ntive levitation is the supporting mechanism, although the measured\nabundances do not match the predicted values very well, as reported\nby other authors in the past. Almost all stars hotter than \u223c50 000 K\ncontain heavy elements. For most of these the spread in element\nabundances is quite narrow and similar to the abundances measured\nin G191-B2B. However, there is an unexplained dichotomy at lower\ntemperatures with some stars having apparently pure H envelopes\nand others detectable quantities of heavy elements. The heavy ele-\nments present in these cooler stars are often stratified, lying in the\noutermost layers of the envelope. The inability to fit the C, N, O and\nSi resonance lines of PG0948+532 and the C IV lines of GD246 may\nalso be evidence for stratification. A possible alternative explanation\nfor all of these stars is that there is circumstellar material present\nbut at a velocity close to that of the photosphere, in contrast to those\nstars where circumstellar components are resolved (Bannister et al.\n2003).\nOnly a few strong temperature\/evolutionary effects are seen in the\nabundance measurements. There is a decreasing Si abundance with\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 341, 870\u2013890\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPatterns in hot DA white dwarfs 889\ntemperature, the N abundance pattern splits into two groups at lower\ntemperatures and there is a sharp decline in Fe and Ni abundance to\nzero, below \u223c50 000 K. When detected, the Fe and Ni abundances\nmaintain an approximately constant ratio, close to the cosmic value\nof \u223c20. For the hottest white dwarfs observed by STIS, the strongest\ndeterminant of abundance appears to be gravity.\nAlthough we have obtained several interesting results from this\nwork, it is clear that the ultimate scope of our conclusions is limited\nby the quality of the data, the number of stars observed and the\nwavelength ranges considered. Further progress can only be made\nby improving the data and expanding the sample. We need to elimi-\nnate some of the biases in the stars chosen for far-UV observations.\nMost observations have concentrated on those objects where there\nwas already evidence for photospheric heavy-element opacity and\nthese stars have received good exposures to search for weak iron\ngroup lines. This is not the case for other stars, where better ex-\nposures are required to ensure that heavy-element measurements\nhave usefully small uncertainties or that the upper limits on abun-\ndances are meaningful. The number of stars with temperatures below\n50 000 K needs to be expanded in an unbiased way, to decide whether\neither of the pure H or metal-containing groups we have identified\nare typical for the DA population or if there really are two distinct\nlines.\nAll of this work needs to be carried out with a consistent mul-\ntiwavelength approach. FUSE spectra are probably better suited to\nmeasuring abundances of lower ionization stages of some impor-\ntant elements such as N or Fe. Fortunately, many of the targets in\nour sample have already been observed by FUSE. The presence of\nas yet undetected companion stars may be responsible for some of\nthe abundance patterns we see. However, we do not have a detailed\npicture of the incidence of binarity in these stars. The signatures\nfrom cool M and L dwarfs can easily be masked by the hot white\ndwarfs at visible wavelengths. Therefore, a programme of infrared\nphotometry and spectroscopy is required to check for the presence of\ncompanion stars. We have initiated such a programme, for the north-\nern stars, on UKIRT (Burleigh et al. 2003). Much of our analysis and\ninterpretation has been informed by knowledge of the EUVE spec-\ntra of some of our sample stars. However, these spectra are limited\nin resolution and number. Higher-resolution and higher signal-to-\nnoise ratio access to the EUV will be an essential element of any\nfuture studies.\nFinally, it is clear that much depends on the continuing availabil-\nity of high signal-to-noise ratio far-UV spectra. These have been the\nkey to the work presented here. In particular, the high resolution is\nessential to ensure that ISM, circumstellar and photospheric compo-\nnents are not confused. There will always be a practical limit to what\nis available, but the contrast between the IUE and STIS capabilities\ndemonstrates that this should be at least at the resolving power\n(\u223c40 000) of the E140M grating and preferably the E140H\n(\u223c100 000). It is worrying that no such future UV capability is\nguaranteed.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThe work reported in this paper was based on observations made\nwith the IUE, HST and FUSE observatories.
