The web-based software, Synchronised Nutrition and Activity ProgramTM (SNAPTM), was\ndeveloped to produce a novel, simple, quick and engaging method of assessing energy balance-related behaviours at a population level, combining\nprinciples from new and existing 24 h recall methodologies, set within a user-friendly interface. Dietary intake was measured using counts for\ntwenty-one food groups and physical activity levels were measured in min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). A combination\nof the mean difference between methods, type II regression and non-parametric limits of agreement techniques were used to examine the accuracy\nand precision of SNAPTM. Method comparison analyses demonstrated a good agreement for both dietary intake and physical activity behaviours.\nFor dietary variables, accuracy of SNAPTM (mean difference) was within ^1 count for the majority of food groups. The proportion of the sample\nwith between-method agreement within ^1 count ranged from 0\u00b740 to 0\u00b799. For min of MVPA, there was no substantial fixed or proportional\nbias, and a mean difference between methods (SNAPTM \u2013 accelerometry) of 29 min. SNAPTM provides a quick, accurate, low-burden, cost-effec-\ntive and engaging method of assessing energy balance behaviours at a population level. Tools such as SNAPTM, which exploit the popularity,\nprivacy and engagement of the computer interface, and linkages with other datasets, could make a substantial contribution to future public\nhealth monitoring and research.\nSchoolchildren: Diet: Physical activity: Computer programs: Recall\nAs the prevalence of childhood obesity continues to rise in the\ndeveloped world and countries in transition(1), it has become a\npublic health priority. Although the genesis of obesity is com-\nplex, it is recognised that childhood overweight and obesity is\nassociated with the metabolic syndrome(2) and that clustered\nmetabolic risk has been shown to track from adolescence\ninto young adulthood(3). Given the insidious consequences\nof childhood obesity, understanding how best to prevent it\nremains a research priority. However, the design of potentially\neffective interventions is somewhat hampered by the general\nlack of good-quality data available, as highlighted by Wanless\nin his 2004 report(4). In addition to this, historically the\nmajority of studies have tended to focus upon one side of\nthe energy balance equation: either physical activity or dietary\nintake alone.\nThe potential benefits of studying the determinants of\nenergy balance-related behaviours, that is, both sides of\nthe energy balance equation, are now recognised and may\nprovide an intrinsic contribution to the development of\nfuture health intervention programmes(5). Currently large-\nscale group or population surveys rely on separate self-\nreported accounts of physical activity and dietary intake\nthrough diary records, frequency and recall question-\nnaires(6,7). However, these methods are not only often\nlabour intensive for researchers, and time consuming and\nmonotonous for children to complete, but do not simul-\ntaneously assess energy balance-related behaviours. To the\nauthors\u2019 knowledge there is currently no available validated\nmethodology that simultaneously assesses both dietary\nintake and physical activity behaviours in school-aged\nchildren.\nThe Synchronised Nutrition and Activity ProgramTM\n(SNAPTM) was developed to address the need for a valid,\nreliable, low-burden, simple, cost-effective and engaging\nmethod of accurately assessing energy balance-related beha-\nviours in children and adolescents at the group or population\nlevel. The present paper describes the development, evaluation\nand future potential of this new software.\n*Corresponding author: Dr Helen J.

Age 7 was determined as the\nminimum age, to reflect the approximate age at which most\nchildren have developed the necessary immediate (24 h)\nrecall skills and time conceptualisation necessary to complete\nthe program without parental assistance(8 \u2013 10). The study\nprotocol was approved by the School of Health and Social\nCare Ethics Committee, University of Teesside and informed\nconsent was obtained from every school, parent and child\nwho participated in the study.\nMeasures\nDescription of the Synchronised Nutrition and Activity\nProgramTM. SNAPTM is a web-based program written\nusing PHP (version 4.0.1), MySQL (version 3.22), and Java-\nScript (version 1.3) to ensure secure data transfer and storage.\nThe software was developed around the principles of dietary\nintake and physical activity recall, integrating new and estab-\nlished methods to enhance recall in children, such as: (1) 24 h\nrecall of the structured school day, which has been shown to\nbe more accurate for children within this age group, when\ncompared with periods of longer duration, or of more irregular\nbehaviour patterns associated with the weekend(8,11); (2) deliv-\nery of the recall activity was in a segmented day format (wake\nup\/before school, on the way to school, breakfast club, mid-\nmorning, lunch, mid-afternoon, on way home from school,\nafter school, evening meal and late evening\/bedtime), which\nhas been shown to enhance recall in children(11); (3) children\nwere instructed to recall both their dietary intake and physical\nactivities simultaneously, to facilitate recall aided by \u2018beha-\nviour chaining\u2019 described by Baranowski & Domel(12); (4)\nchildren were also asked where they consumed their evening\nand midday meals to assist recall and begin to contextualise\ncertain behaviour patterns; (5) the user interface was designed\nby a computer-gaming expert to create a novel user-friendly\ninterface to enhance recall and engagement, a method shown\nto be successful in previous computer-delivered instru-\nments(13 \u2013 16); (6) visual memory prompts were provided by\nfood\/drink and activity pictures (Fig. 1); (7) at the end of\nthe program participants were reminded of all activities,\nfood and drink recorded, and were provided with the opportu-\nnity to make final additions or corrections before finishing\n(Fig. 2).\nThe incorporated list of commonly consumed foods (n 40)\nand drinks (n 9) was developed from a combination of findings\nfrom the National Diet and Nutrition Survey(17) and previous\nresearch into the dietary intake of local children (University\nof Teesside, unpublished results), and finalised by an expert\nsteering group. A free-text option box labelled \u2018other\u2019 was\nalso included to capture any unlisted food or drink. Given\nthe documented difficulties of accurately assessing portion\nsizes in children(7), all foods and drinks were analysed by\ncount (i.e. the number of times a particular food was selected).\nIt was assumed that counts of food and drink would provide\nthe necessary proxy indicator of dietary behaviours.\nThe incorporated list of common physical activities (n 29;\nwithin the domains of sedentary, structured, household\nchores and play activities) was developed from a combination\nof common children\u2019s activities selected from the Compen-\ndium of Physical Activities(18) and previous research into\nthe physical activities of local children (University of Tees-\nside, unpublished results). A free-text option box labelled\n\u2018other\u2019 was also included to capture any unlisted activities.\nTransport activities to and from school were investigated sep-\narately and categorised into: (1) walk or run; (2) cycle, skate\nor scoot; (3) bus, car, tram or train. Following the selection\nof an activity, the participant was questioned further about\nduration and intensity. Activity duration was estimated in\nmin, by dragging a slider on a timeline, which ranged from\n0 to 3 h, visually segmented into 10 min intervals for the\nfirst hour and 30 min intervals thereafter. Landmark intervals\nwere illustrated with memory prompts, as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe design of the timeline and associated memory prompts\nwere similar to the trichotomous format described by Ridley\net al.(13). As children have shown difficulty in conceptualising\nactivity intensity(19), they were asked to click on one of\nthree faces, which illustrated three levels of exertion (light,\nmoderate or vigorous; Fig. 3).\nTo enhance the usability of the program, large radio but-\ntons, simple scrolling fields and text enlargement options\nwere included. To aid data interpretation, after completing\nthe recall, participants were asked a short series of questions\nto determine whether data recorded from the previous day\nwere a typical representation of normal physical activity and\ndietary intake behaviour.\nEach reported physical activity was assigned an intensity\ncode (in metabolic equivalents; MET) drawn from the Compen-\ndium of Physical Activities(18). A MET is the estimated resting\nenergy expenditure with activities defined in multiples of rest-\ning metabolism. Although the Compendium values were\nderived from adult studies, the ratio of activity to resting\nenergy expenditure (i.e. MET) is similar in children and\nadults(20). The intensity thresholds adopted were 3 MET for\nmoderate intensity and 6 MET for vigorous intensity activities.\nThe primary outcome variable for physical activity behaviour\nwas defined as the total min of moderate to vigorous physical\nactivity (the sum of all reported activities of 3 MET and above).\nAccelerometry. An objective measurement of physical\nactivity behaviour using accelerometry (Actigraph GT1M;\nActigraph, Fort Walton Beach, FL, USA) was used as a refer-\nence method for comparison against the SNAPTM self-report\ntool. The Actigraph is a small, lightweight motion sensor,\nworn on the right hip (secured by an elastic waistband). It cap-\ntures and stores instances of vertical movement (in counts per\nmin) and has been shown to produce reliable assessments of\nphysical activity levels in children, although it is insensitive\nto cycling, load carriage, locomotion on a gradient and other\nnon-ambulatory activities restricted mainly to upper torso\nmovement(21).\nParticipants were instructed to wear the device during\nwaking hours, and remove it only during bathing, showering\nand swimming, making a note of the time and reason for\nremoval and the time of subsequent replacement. The mini-\nmum wear time to represent the waking day was defined as\nSynchronised Nutrition and Activity ProgramTM 1267\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\n10 h, and this was cross-checked against the self-reported\nwaking time from the SNAPTM tool (minus the reported\nperiods of non-wear). In screening and processing the\naccelerometry data, the criterion for non-wear was 60 min of\nconsecutive zero counts, cross-checked against the self-\nreported removal and replacement times.\nActivity counts were analysed in epochs of 1 min, with each\nmin assigned an intensity category according to a cut-point for\ncounts per min defined by age-specific prediction\nequations(22 \u2013 24). As for the SNAPTM tool, the threshold for\nmoderate intensity activity was defined as 3 MET. This\nprocessing permitted the estimation of the total number of\nmin of moderate to vigorous physical activity.\n24 h Multiple pass dietary recall. The 24 h multiple-pass\nrecall method, originally developed for food surveys carried\nout by the United States Department of Agriculture(25) and\nfurther improved(26), was used as a reference standard to com-\npare with the dietary intake data from SNAPTM. In essence the\n24 h multiple pass is comprised of a five-step recall consisting\nof a quick list of all foods and drinks consumed the previous\nday, followed by a detailed description of the foods, with the\ninterviewer probing for further information on time or\noccasion, forgotten foods and food details. All researchers\nwere trained to deliver the multiple-pass interview before\nworking with participants.\nMethod comparison protocol\nFollowing child and parental consent, each child was fitted\nwith an Actigraph for 2 d (day 1, to desensitise them to wear-\ning the monitor and day 2, the day of activities to be recalled\nby SNAPTM). Children were given detailed instructions of\nFig. 1. An example of Synchronised Nutrition and Activity ProgramTM (SNAPTM) food, drink and physical activity graphics.\nH. J. Moore et al.1268\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nhow to care for and wear their Actigraph device. On day 3 the\nchildren returned their Actigraph and completed the SNAPTM\nprogram, after a standardised lesson plan was delivered to pro-\nvide operating instructions. After completing the SNAPTM\nprogram the children were invited back to join two trained\nresearchers who carried out the 24 h multiple-pass dietary\nrecall exercise.\nAfter completing SNAPTM and before being interviewed,\neach child was also asked to complete and return an anon-\nymous questionnaire to gain qualitative feedback on what\nthey liked, disliked and what they would like to change\nabout SNAPTM.\nData analysis\nFor analytical purposes dietary intake from both SNAPTM and\n24 h multiple pass was categorised into counts of twenty-one\ngroups (codes shown in Table 1). Further grouping was carried\nout to investigate the following dietary behaviours: (1)\nfruit and vegetable intake (codes 1 and 2); (2) fizzy drink con-\nsumption (codes 2 and 3); (3) dairy intake (codes 6 and 16);\n(4) consumption of energy-dense foods (codes 7, 8, 9, 10\nand 11); (5) consumption of complex carbohydrate-rich\nfoods (codes 17, 18 and 19). The outcome variable for the\nphysical activity data was the total min of moderate to vigor-\nous physical activity estimated from the accelerometry v. the\nSNAPTM methods. The dietary and physical activity data\nfrom SNAPTM were compared with the reference methods\n(multiple pass and accelerometry, respectively) using a combi-\nnation of the mean between-method differences and non-para-\nmetric limits of agreement techniques(27). Throughout, 90 %\nCI are reported, as recommended by Sterne & Smith(28).\nUnless specified, all data analysis was carried out using\nSTATAw version 8 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX,\nUSA). Preliminary analyses revealed no substantial differ-\nences in measurement error between males and females. Con-\nsequently, all method comparison analyses are presented for\nthe pooled sample to maximise precision of estimation.\nFor the dietary variables, the accuracy of the computer tool\nagainst the multiple-pass method was given by the mean\ndifference (systematic bias) in counts between methods (com-\nputer tool minus reference method). The precision of the tool\nwas assessed by calculating the proportion of the sample dis-\nplaying between-method agreement to within ^ 1 count. For\nthe physical activity data, accuracy of the SNAPTM against the\naccelerometry was assessed initially by the mean difference\nFig. 2.

The total min of moderate to vigorous physi-\ncal activity for the predictor method (computer tool)\nwas regressed on the reference method (accelerometry).\nUnlike ordinary least-squares regression, the Passing\u2013\nBablok method permits measurement error in both the refer-\nence method and the comparison method. Importantly, with\nrespect to the present study, this imprecision can have non-\nconstant variance over the sampling range, and the regression\nline is not adversely affected by outliers. Fixed bias was indi-\ncated if the 90 % CI for the intercept did not include zero. Pro-\nportional bias was revealed if the slope differed from unity.\nThe overall mean bias of the computer tool compared with\nthe accelerometry was calculated from the Passing\u2013Bablok\nregression equation at the mean of the reference method\ndistribution. The bias was calculated as Y\u02c6 \u2013 X, where Y\u02c6 is\nthe total min of moderate to vigorous physical activity on\nthe computer tool predicted from the regression equation\nat the mean accelerometry value (X). Precision was assessed\nby comparing the proportion of the sample that met rec-\nommendations of 60 or 90 min of moderate to vigorous physi-\ncal activity in the previous day. The physical activity method\ncomparison is based on 106 children (fifteen paired data points\nwere eliminated due to missing accelerometry data or incom-\nplete SNAPTM data).\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nIn total 121 children took part in the validation study; seventy-\ntwo girls and forty-nine boys, aged 10\u00b77 (SD 2\u00b72) years. All\nchildren were in mainstream education and all except seven\nspoke English as their first language. Time to complete\nFig. 3.

No child was\nunable to complete the program, although in general more\nassistance was required for the younger children. When com-\npared qualitatively with the dietary and physical activity vali-\ndation reference methods, completion of SNAPTM was faster\nand far less disruptive to the school day.\nDietary behaviours\nA summary of the dietary intake data analysis (n 121) cate-\ngorised by dietary behaviour group (total fizzy drinks, total\ndairy, total energy-dense food, total carbohydrate-rich food,\nand total fruit and vegetables; Table 1) is shown in Table 2.\nIn general, SNAPTM underestimated mean counts of dietary\nconstituents and the accuracy decreased with increasing\ncounts. However, the mean difference between methods\nwas substantially less than 1 count for all but three categories\n\u2013 confectionery and cakes (1\u00b715 counts), total energy-\ndense foods (1\u00b752 counts), and total carbohydrate-rich foods\n(0\u00b797 counts).\nOn average, the children consumed approximately one fizzy\ndrink per d, with sugary varieties preferred to the\ndiet alternative. Children also consumed, on average, just\nover one fruit or vegetable per d. The intake of complex\ncarbohydrate-rich foods was relatively high, so too was the\nconsumption of energy-dense foods, which were consumed\nbetween three and five times per d.\nPhysical activity analysis\nTable 3 illustrates how many children participated in the\ndifferent activity options (not including transport activities)\nillustrated in SNAPTM.

Applying the Passing\u2013Bablok regression equation at\nthe mean accelerometry value (112 min) resulted in a pre-\ndicted computer tool value of 108\u00b74 min \u2013 an overall bias\n(fixed and proportional combined) of less than 4 min.\nThe percentage of children who met the recommended\n60 min of daily moderate to vigorous activity on this particular\nday was 70 % according to the computer tool and 68 % with the\naccelerometry method (difference in proportions 0\u00b702; 90 % CI\n20\u00b708, 0\u00b712). The percentage of the sample meeting 90 min of\nphysical activity at the same intensity was 52 % according to\nthe computer tool v. 54 % with the accelerometry method\n(difference in proportions 20\u00b702; 90 % CI 20\u00b711, 0\u00b707).\nQualitative feedback\nThemes emerging from the qualitative questionnaires are shown\nin Table 5. Generally the feedback was very positive, with the\nmajority of children reporting that they enjoyed using SNAPTM\nand were able to complete it without great difficulty. However,\nthey also provided some useful feedback which will be incorpor-\nated into the next version of SNAPTM, such as more food and\nactivities options and format improvements.\nDiscussion\nThe SNAPTM software produced a quick, low-burden, simple,\ncost-effective and engaging method of assessing energy bal-\nance behaviours at a group level. Preliminary analysis demon-\nstrated acceptable measurement agreement with the standard\nmethod comparators and the majority of participating children\nenjoyed completing the program and provided positive\nfeedback.\nAlthough on average SNAPTM underestimated moderate to\nvigorous activities, this was not significant or substantial. The\ntotal bias between methods (fixed and proportional combined)\nof less than 4 min provides a strong indication that SNAPTM is\naccurate at a group or population level. A high percentage of\nchildren from this sample met the current recommendations of\n60 min of physical activity per d(31). Over half of this group\nalso met the newer recommendation(32) of 90 min.\nSNAPTM also provided an acceptable indication of dietary\nintake behaviour markers similar to the food-frequency work\npublished previously(33,34). For most food groups, the mean\ndifferences were close to zero, although in a few instances\nSNAPTM underestimated dietary intake by between 1 and\n1\u00b75 counts when compared with the findings from the mul-\ntiple-pass questionnaire. Given the number of dietary com-\nponents and the size of the study population, more detailed\nanalysis on the dietary data were not feasible, but will be\ninvestigated in a larger second-phase study. The CI for the\nmean difference between methods indicate that the SNAPTM\nis sufficiently accurate.\nThe dietary intake recorded is representative of children\nfrom this area (University of Teesside, unpublished results).\nAlthough consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods was rela-\ntively high (approximately 3 counts per d), this was coupled\nto a very high mean intake of energy-dense foods (four per\nd) and a fruit and vegetable count that falls far short of the rec-\nommended five per d(35). While measurement agreement\nbetween the two methods is good, it is important to note\nthat as agreement was calculated to within ^1 count, it is\nclear that food groups with smaller counts (such as pies and\npasties) will have better agreement than groups with much\nlarger counts (such as confectionery and cakes).\nAt a group level both the physical activity and dietary\ndata generated from the SNAPTM were comparable with\nthe data generated from the existing standard methods of\npopulation-level dietary and physical activity assessment.\nTable 4.

Further studies, which\nwill address and build upon the qualitative findings from the\nchildren\u2019s questionnaires, are therefore required within a\nnationally representative population. This second phase\nshould also explore the reliability of SNAPTM and examine\nthe potential use of SNAPTM in recording habitual energy bal-\nance-related behaviours over longer time periods.\nThe potential benefits of this energy balance-related beha-\nviour assessment tool may provide opportunities to examine\nclustering effects(36) and a link to other important datasets\nsuch as educational attainment and body weight(37). The\nfuture of such tools, which exploit the popularity, privacy\nand engagement of the computer interface (in addition to the\npossibility of data linkage), could make a substantial contri-\nbution to future public health monitoring and research.\nAcknowledgements\nAll authors contributed equally to the present study, which\nwas funded internally by the University of Teesside.
