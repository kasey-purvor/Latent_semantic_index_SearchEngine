Maini,a Kevin J. Paintera and Helene Nguyen Phong Chaub\na Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, 24-29 St Giles\u00cf, Oxford, UK OX1\n3L B\nb Ecole des Mines de Paris, 60 bd Saint-Michel-75272 Paris Cedex 06, France\nOne of the central issues in developmental biology is the formation of spatial pattern in the embryo. A number of theories have\nbeen proposed to account for this phenomenon. The most widely studied is reaction di\u2020usion theory, which proposes that a\nchemical pre-pattern is \u00d0rst set up due to a system of reacting and di\u2020using chemicals, and cells respond to this pre-pattern by\ndi\u2020erentiating accordingly. Such patterns, known as Turing structures, were \u00d0rst identi\u00d0ed in chemical systems only recently. This\narticle reviews the application of reaction di\u2020usion theory to chemical systems and then considers a number of biological applica-\ntions.\nOne of the central issues in developmental biology is the\nunderstanding of the emergence of structure and form from\nthe almost uniform mass of dividing cells that constitutes the\nearly embryo. Although genes play a key role, genetics says\nnothing about the actual mechanisms which bring together\nthe constituent parts into a coherent pattern\u00c8knowing the\ndictionary does not mean that we know Shakespeare.\nIn his seminal paper, Turing1 demonstrated, theoretically,\nthat a system of reacting and di\u2020using chemicals could spon-\ntaneously evolve to spatially heterogeneous patterns from an\ninitially uniform state in response to in\u00d0nitesimal pertur-\nbations. Remarkably, he showed that di\u2020usion could drive a\nchemical system to instability, leading to spatial pattern where\nno prior pattern existed. He speci\u00d0cally considered a system of\ntwo chemicals, in which one was an activator and the other an\ninhibitor. That is, one chemical, the activator, stimulated and\nenhanced the production of the other chemical, which, in turn,\ndepleted or inhibited the formation of the activator. He\nshowed that if the di\u2020usion of the inhibitor was greater than\nthat of the activator, then di\u2020usion-driven instability could\nresult. This is counter-intuitive, as one usually thinks of di\u2020u-\nsion as a homogenizing process.\nTo gain an intuitive understanding of di\u2020usion-driven insta-\nbility, let us consider the following analogy : suppose that we\nhave the simple autocatalytic process A ] B] 2B in an\nunstirred reactor initially full of chemical A but with no\nchemical B. Then, obviously, there will be no reaction. If we\nnow seed the reaction domain with some B at various local\nsites and if A can di\u2020use but B is immobilised, reaction will\nonly occur where there has been seeding, with high concentra-\ntions of B building up at these points. Eventually, A would\ndisappear and we would be left with \u201cspots \u00cf of B. If, however,\nthere is a supply of A across the domain (perhaps by forma-\ntion from a precursor) and also a decay step for B to limit its\ngrowth, then it may be possible to get a balance between\nsupply and di\u2020usion away of A balancing the decay of B in\nthe spots, to give steady-state, long-lived pattern, with high A\nconcentrations in between the spots and high B concentration\nin the spots. The exact pattern of spots would still depend on\nthe precise initial seeding, but Turing makes two remarkable\npredictions : \u00d0rst, that this structure develops spontaneously\neven from an initially almost homogeneous distribution of A\nand B provided that A di\u2020uses more rapidly than B and,\nsecond, that the \u00d0nal pattern does not necessarily depend on\nthe initial perturbation if B has a non-zero di\u2020usivity\u00c8the\nspots adjust their position to the demands of the local \u201c supply\nand demand\u00cf due to di\u2020usion and reaction.\nA general reaction di\u2020usion (RD) system has the form\nLu\nLt\n\\ D+2u ] f (u, p) (1)\nwhere u is a vector representing chemical concentrations.\nBoundary conditions are usually taken as zero \u00d1ux, that is, the\ndomain boundary is assumed impermeable to the chemicals.\nTypically, one considers a two-chemical system, in which case\nwhere and are chemical concentrations. Theu \\ (u1, u2), u1 u2\u00d0rst term on the right-hand side represents di\u2020usion, with D a\nmatrix of di\u2020usion coefficients, assumed constant, and the\nsecond term represents chemical reactions, with kinetic\nparameters p, for example, rate constants, production and\ndegradation terms. The form of f depends on the system being\nstudied (see later) but here we give an illustrative example due\nto Schnakenberg :2\nConsider the series of reactions\nX\u00bd A, 2X] Y] 3X, B] Y (2)\nUsing the law of mass action, we have that the production of\nX occurs at the rate\nk2 a [ k1u1 ] k3 u12u2 (3)\nwhile that of Y is\nk4 b [ k3 u12u2 (4)\nwhere a and b are the concentrations of X, Y, A and B,u1, u2 ,respectively, and . . . , are rate constants. Assuming thatk1, k4X and Y di\u2020use with di\u2020usion coefficients and respec-D1 D2 ,tively, and that A and B are in abundance so that a and b can\nbe assumed approximately constant, the reaction di\u2020usion\nsystem satis\u00d0ed by and isu1 u2\nLu1\nLt\n\\ D1+2u1 ] k2 a [ k1u1] k3 u12u2\nLu2\nLt\n\\ D2+2u2 ] k4 b [ k3 u12u2\nA uniform steady state of a general RD system is the vector\nof concentrations constant in space and time, satisfyingu0 ,p) \\ 0. Turing showed that, under certain conditions onf (u0 ,the kinetic parameters and di\u2020usion coefficients, such a steady\nstate, stable in the absence of di\u2020usion, could be driven\nunstable in the presence of di\u2020usion and evolve to a spatially\npatterned state as a certain parameter\u00c8the bifurcation, or\ncontrol, parameter\u00c8was varied. Turing was interested in mor-\nphogenesis, the formation of structure, so he proposed that\nJ. Chem. Soc., Faraday T rans., 1997, 93(20), 3601\u00c83610 3601\nthis chemical pattern could serve as a pre-pattern to which\ncells would respond in such a way that a spatial structure\nwould form. For example, if one of the chemicals was a plant\ngrowth hormone, then the pre-pattern could result in pat-\nterned growth. More generally, these chemicals (termed\nmorphogens) could trigger a genetic switch causing cell di\u2020er-\nentiation.\nSince Turing\u00cfs paper there has been a vast literature on\nboth the theoretical and practical aspects of RD systems (see,\nfor example, ref. 3\u00c88). Turing models have been applied to\nsuch diverse areas as ecology,9 semiconductor physics,10\nmaterial sciences,11,12 hydrodynamics,13 astrophysics14 and\neven economics.15\nIn this partial review we focus only on two speci\u00d0c areas of\napplication, namely chemistry and biology. The application of\nTuring\u00cfs theory to these areas has come in for much criticism,\nfor three main reasons : \u00d0rst, there was no conclusive proof\nthat Turing patterns actually existed in nature ; second, there\nis no de\u00d0nitive proof of the existence of morphogens ; third,\nthe solutions tend to be very sensitive to perturbations and\nthus the model appears unrealistic when applied to many\nexamples in morphogenesis where the patterning process is\nrobust. Although the evidence for the existence of morphogens\nis still tenuous, Turing structures have now been found in\nchemistry, and di\u2020erent types of boundary conditions have\nbeen shown to increase the stability of model solutions. We\nbegin by a brief survey of recent work on the identi\u00d0cation of\nTuring patterns in chemistry.\nSpatial and spatiotemporal patterns in chemistry\nTime-dependent patterns in chemical systems have been\nstudied for many years. The best known oscillatory reaction is\nthe Belousov\u00c8Zhabotinsky reaction, \u00d0rst reported by\nBelousov16 in an unpublished paper which appeared in the\nbook edited by Field and Burger17 (see Plate 1). This is an\nexample of a chemical oscillator. Brie\u00d1y, bromate ions oxidise\nmalonic acid in a reaction catalysed by cerium, which has the\nstates Ce3` and Ce4`. Sustained periodic oscillations are\nobserved in the cerium ions. If, instead, one uses the catalyst\nFe2` and Fe3` and phenanthroline, the periodic oscillations\nare visualized as colour changes between reddish-orange and\nblue19 (see Plate 1). In this system, the activator is andHBrO2the inhibitor is Br~. The model and detailed analysis can be\nfound in ref. 20 (see also ref. 21\u00c823). This system also exhibits\na number of di\u2020erent types of wave structures, such as propa-\ngating fronts, spiral waves, target patterns and toroidal\nscrolls.24h30\nUntil recently, however, attempts to obtain experimental\nevidence of Turing structures had proved unsuccessful. A key\nreason for the failure to \u00d0nd Turing patterns in experiments\nwas due to the need for signi\u00d0cant variation in di\u2020usion coeffi-\ncients of the reactants. Turing structures require the inhibitor\nto di\u2020use at a much faster rate than the activator. Numerical\nsimulations of many of the model systems studied, such as the\nBrusselator model or the reduced Oregonator model of the\nBelousov\u00c8Zhabotinsky reaction,31,32 predict that Turing\nstructures are only generated when di\u2020usion coefficients di\u2020er\nby at least one order of magnitude, that is, DHBrO2 @ DBr~ .Experimentally obtained di\u2020usion coefficients of the reactants,\nhowever, show much less variation. More recently, it has been\nshown33 that a di\u2020usion induced instability can occur under\ncertain very special conditions with nearly equal di\u2020usion\ncoefficients.\nNote that thermodynamically closed systems must even-\ntually approach their unique state of chemical equilibrium,\nwhich will be spatially homogeneous. In such systems, any\npattern formation is necessarily transient.\nThe \u00d0rst experimental evidence of the existence of Turing\nstructures was presented by De Kepper\u00cfs group in Bord-\nPlate 1 Spatiotemporal patterns in the Belousov\u00c8Zhabotinsky reac-\ntion. (a) Target patterns, (b) spiral patterns (Reprinted from ref. 18\nwith kind permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry).\neaux.34,35 They used an open reactor system, wherein reac-\ntants were continuously fed into the system, keeping it far\nfrom equilibrium. The resultant sustained standing non-\nequilibrium chemical patterns exhibit all the properties of\nTuring structures. The veri\u00d0cation of Turing\u00cfs prediction,\nnearly forty years after the original theory, has revived interest\nand motivated greater study in the area.\nThe reaction that has received the greatest attention is the\nchlorite\u00c8iodide\u00c8malonic acid\u00c8starch (CIMA) reaction36 and\nwe now examine this is some detail.\nThe chlorite\u2013iodide\u2013malonic acid\u2013starch reaction (CIMA\nreaction)\nThe reactor consists of a block of hydrogel in contact with the\ncontents of two continuous-\u00d1ow stirred tank reactors (CSTRs)\non opposite sides of the gel. Each of the reservoirs contains a\nnon-reacting subset of reagents which are continuously\npumped into the reaction. This keeps reactant concentrations\nuniform and constant during the experiment. The gel inhibits\nany convective motion so that the only motion involved is due\nto di\u2020usion of the chemicals. Full details of the experimental\nsetup to generate stationary patterns can be found in ref.\n35\u00c837.\nA soluble starch colour indicator is included to visualise\nconcentration changes. Starch colour switches from yellow to\nblue, which is monitored in transmitted light with a video\ncamera. Dark blue regions correspond to high concentrations\nof the starch\u00c8triiodide complex whereas clear zones are char-\nacterized by the presence of oxidised states only. Note that\nstarch was added simply to aid visualisation, but its binding\nto the iodide ions turned out to be absolutely crucial, as it\n3602 J. Chem. Soc., Faraday T rans., 1997, V ol. 93\nreduced the mobility of the latter and hence enhanced the\nratio of di\u2020usion coefficients allowing Turing instability to\noccur (see later).\nThree geometries of reactors can be distinguished.\n(1) The thin strip reactor. Used in the original experiments,\nthis is a narrow rectangular ribbon of a transparent chemi-\ncally inert hydrogel with a thickness greater than \u00d0ve times\nthe wavelength of the pattern. Reactors have been devised\nwith a thickness of the order of the pattern wavelength to\napproximate a two-dimensional system.\n(2) Ouyang and Swinney38 use a \u00d1at disk of gel sandwiched\nbetween two porous glass disks.\n(3) To study the in\u00d1uence of geometry on the pattern selec-\ntion mechanism, De Kepper et al.35 have designed a reactor\nwith an annular gel strip. Two di\u2020erent experiments were per-\nformed, one in the classical rectangular strip and the other in\nthe annular reactor. It was found that generation of the pat-\nterns was not in\u00d1uenced by the geometry of the reactor.\nDe Kepper et al.35 have observed the formation of a sta-\ntionary three-dimensional pattern consisting of parallel lines\nof periodic spots. This body-centred cubic structure is in\nagreement with the theory developed in ref. 39. Using sym-\nmetry arguments, this theory demonstrated that the only\nTuring structures that persist in three-dimensional space are\nthose with wave-vectors satisfying a de\u00d0nite angular relation.\nThe body-centred cubic pattern is found to be the most stable.\nPatterns develop spontaneously over a well de\u00d0ned range of\nmalonic acid concentration. The wavelength of 0.2 mm\nappears intrinsic and is not related to geometric character-\nistics of the system. The pattern is also in\u00d1uenced by the tem-\nperature, which controls the reaction rates.\nOuyang and Swinney37 obtained quasi two-dimensional\nstructures, maintained inde\u00d0nitely in a non-equilibrium state.\nThe patterns develop spontaneously from the spatially\nuniform state on variation of a control parameter (chemical\nconcentrations or temperature). These Turing patterns are\nshown in Fig. 1. In these experiments, the concentrations of\niodide and malonic acid are chosen as control parameters and\nother concentrations are kept constant. Initially, transient\nyellow circles emerge and start to grow in a blue surrounding.\nThese structures dissolve and break into dot patterns demon-\nstrating a wide distribution of sizes. The dots evolve to a\nFig. 1 Di\u2020erent types of stationary chemical (Turing) patterns in the\nCIMA reaction (see ref. 37 for full details). Bars represent 1 mm.\n(Reprinted with permission from Nature.)\nquasi-stationary structure consisting of multiple domains of\nyellow hexagons of di\u2020erent orientations. These hexagons,\ndenoted are approximately uniform in size.H\np\n,\nRe-entrant hexagons, that is dark-blue hexagons formed in\na light background, designated by and distributed in aH0 ,structure similar to a honeycomb lattice, have recently been\nreported in ref. 40, but these patterns appear only transiently.\nAt high iodide or low malonic acid concentration the\ndomains are no longer composed of hexagons, but a station-\nary array of regularly spaced out stripes of equal width forms.\nA stable mixed solution of the above two patterns can also\noccur. These patterns can be qualitatively described as the\nstretching of the regular hexagonal lattice along the direction\nof the stripes. Distorted yellow dots are no longer uniform in\nsize or form. A transition from an initially uniform state to a\nhexagonal pattern is also obtained through a temperature\nchange.\nA rhombic pattern has been generated in ref. 41 using\nspecial initial conditions. The photosensitive nature of the\nCIMA reaction is exploited by imposing particular initial con-\nditions using illuminated, computer-generated photographs of\nspeci\u00d0c spatial patterns. The desired perturbation is thus\ncreated in the reaction medium and once this initial pattern\nhas settled down, the system is left to evolve freely. The ulti-\nmate pattern that arises depends on the characteristic angle of\nthe imposed rhombic initial perturbation.\nA more complex structure, referred to as a \u201cblack-eye \u00cf\npattern and illustrated in Fig. 2, appears well beyond the\nprimary instability of a hexagonal array through increase in\nthe malonic acid concentration.41\nThis black-eye pattern is thought to be the result of a reso-\nnant interaction between the basic modes of a hexagonal\narray. It can be seen as the superposition of two di\u2020erent hex-\nagonal lattices : one of large yellow spots and another com-\nposed of small dark blue dots. At a higher concentration of\nmalonic acid, the black-eye pattern becomes unstable and a\ntransition to regularly spaced stripes of equal width occurs.\nThe spatial patterns produced by this reaction are funda-\nmentally di\u2020erent to the more widely known target and spiral\n\u201cpatterns \u00cf. The latter are not really patterns but are actually\nwave structures. We now brie\u00d1y consider two other types of\npatterns.\nFig. 2 An example of the \u201cblack-eye \u00cf patterns generated in ref. 41.\n(Reprinted with kind permission from ref. 41.)\nJ. Chem. Soc., Faraday T rans., 1997, V ol. 93 3603\nThe polyacrylamide\u2013Methylene Blue\u2013sul\u00d0de\u2013oxygen system\nTuring-like patterns have been observed in the\npolyacrylamide\u00c8Methylene Blue\u00c8sul\u00d0de\u00c8oxygen (PA\u00c8MBO)\nreaction.42 As this is a closed setup only transient patterns are\npossible and the system \u00d0nally relaxes to its equilibrium state.\nDetails of this reaction and corresponding mathematical\nmodels can be found in ref. 43\u00c845.\nBrie\u00d1y, this reaction exploits the oscillating properties of the\nMethylene Blue\u00c8sul\u00d0de\u00c8oxygen (MBO) system, which has\nbeen studied by Burger and Field.43 The reaction of this oscil-\nlator is the Methylene Blue catalysed oxidation of HS~ by O2in water at pH \\ 12. The monomer Methylene Blue exhibits\ntwo stable forms : the blue MB` and the colourless reduced\nform MBH. The redox reaction linking these two forms can\nbe represented in two steps :\nMB`] e~\u00bd MB0\nMB0] e~] H`\u00bd MBH\nResch et al.44 determined a mechanism for the MBO, com-\nposed of fourteen reactions involving several radical and\nanionic compounds. A reduced model consisting of eight\nchemical reactions and \u00d0ve variables has been proposed by\nZhang and Field.45\nThe experiment is performed in a Petri dish and is closed\nwith respect to all chemical species except oxygen. This e\u2020ect\nmeans that only transient patterns are possible\u00c8the system\nrelaxes to its equilibrium state. Transient patterns show a hex-\nagonal colourless lattice in a dark-blue surround. Removal of\nthe gel from the Petri dish allows the surfaces contact with the\nMethylene Blue solution and oxygen. This allows oxygen to\ndi\u2020use from below into the gel. Short-lived blue hexagons\nappear in a light-blue background. The pattern relatively\nquickly disintegrates to the homogeneous state. Colourless\nspots eventually re-emerge from this uniform state after\nanother 50 min. If the gel is not removed from the Petri dish,\nthe colourless hexagons break up to form short stripes and\nzigzag patterns. This spontaneous transition from hexagonal\nto zigzags originates through modi\u00d0cation of the reactants\nconcentrations which inevitably occurs in a closed system.\nThe zigzag pattern is found to coexist with the hexagonal\nstructure. Experimental results are shown in Fig. 3.42\nThe hexacyanoferrate(II)\u2013iodate\u2013sul\u00d0te reaction\nLee et al.46 have observed non-Turing stationary patterns in\nthe hexacyanoferrate(II)\u00c8iodate\u00c8sul\u00d0te (FIS) reaction, using an\nexperimental technique similar to that used for the CIMA\nreaction. These patterns develop through propagation of\nchemical fronts from the initial perturbation. The fronts pro-\npagate towards one another but stop when they reach a criti-\nFig. 3 Transient Turing-like patterns in the PA\u00c8MBO system (see\nref. 42 for full details).

The patterns\nhave no long-range regularity, making them fundamentally\ndi\u2020erent to patterns developed through a Turing bifurcation.\nThe reaction also exhibits \u201c self-replicating \u00cf spots.47 In a\npattern of this form a spot will grow, divide into two and the\ntwo spots move away. As they \u00d0ll the domain, some spots\ndecay. In addition to spots, growing annuli have also been\nobserved.47 A brief mathematical analysis of this phenomenon\nhas been carried out in ref. 48 for the Gray\u00c8Scott model.49h51\nMore recently, Haim et al.52 have observed oscillating spots\nin the FIS reaction. This behaviour is thought to arise\nthrough the interactions of the chemical front with the reactor\nboundary. Mathematical analysis of a bistable RD model\nexhibiting patterning phenomena similar to that observed in\nthe FIS reaction supports this suggestion.\nLengyel and Epstein53 have given an account of some of the\ndifficulties in creating Turing patterns in experimental systems\nand how new systems can be designed to create such patterns.\nRecently they have examined the challenge of obtaining\nFig. 4 Time asymptotic patterns for the FIS reaction. Dark regions correspond to low hexacyanoferrate(II) concentration and light regions to\nhigh hexacyanoferrate(II) concentration.46 (Reprinted with kind permission from ref. 46.)\n3604 J. Chem.

Although this is\nunrealistic chemically, and predicts unbounded growth in\nchemical concentrations, it enabled him to carry out a mathe-\nmatical analysis and predict the types of patterning pheno-\nmena that the model could exhibit. There are two types of\npatterns : spatial patterns, wherein a spatially heterogeneous\npattern emerges with a de\u00d0ned wavelength ; and spatio-\ntemporal patterns, in which the pattern varies periodically in\ntime, as well as having a de\u00d0ned spatial wavelength. Such pat-\nterns emerge when the uniform steady state loses stability as a\ncontrol bifurcation parameter passes through a critical value.\nAt that critical value, the wavelength of the pattern and its\nperiod (in the case of spatiotemporal patterns) can be calcu-\nlated in terms of the parameters of the model. Which type of\npattern emerges depends on the parameter space being con-\nsidered.\nSince Turing\u00cfs paper, several RD models have been con-\nsidered with non-linear kinetic terms. These models are more\nrealistic in that their solutions evolve to bounded values, and\nare derived essentially in three di\u2020erent ways : (i) phenomeno-\nlogically, (ii) to model a hypothetical reaction and (iii) empiri-\ncally. An example of (i) is the model of Geirer and\nMeinhardt.55 One version of this model has the kinetics f1(u1,u2)\\ k1[ k2 u1] (k3 u12\/u2), f2(u1, u2) \\ k4 u12 [ k5 u2 ,where . . . , are positive constants. In this system, isk1, k5 u1the activator ; it is produced by autocatalysis and it activates\nthe production of which is the inhibitor, inhibiting theu2 ,production of u1.The Schnakenberg2 model discussed above is an example of\n(ii) and is based on a cubic autocatalytic process.\nAn example of (iii) is the Thomas model,56 in which f1(u1,whereu2)\\ k1[ k2 u1[ H, f2(u1, u2) \\ k3[ k4 u2[ H, H \\and . . . , are positivek5 u1u2\/(k6] k7 u1] k8 u12)u2 , k1, k8parameters. This is based on a speci\u00d0c reaction involving the\nsubstrates oxygen and uric acid which react in the(u1) (u2),presence of the enzyme uricase.\nThe patterning properties of these models have been well\ndocumented for one-dimensional domains with zero \u00d1ux\nboundary conditions in the vicinity of primary bifurcation\npoints. However, the behaviour of solutions far away from\nbifurcation points, or under di\u2020erent types of boundary condi-\ntions, has received little attention. Until recently, the two-\ndimensional pattern forming properties of these systems had\nalso received little attention. However, the experimental\nobservations reviewed in the previous section have resulted in\na great deal of analysis of these systems in two dimensions. In\nsome cases, standard RD systems have been examined to see if\nthey exhibit solutions similar to those observed experimen-\ntally. For example, Du\u00d0et and Boissonade57 have derived a\nvariety of two-dimensional patterns using Schnakenberg\nchemical kinetics that are similar to those observed in the\nCIMA reaction (Fig. 5). Their numerical simulations also\npredict rhombic arrays. A theoretical study of pattern forma-\ntion in the presence of symmetries has been presented by\nGunaratne et al.41 who have demonstrated the existence of\nrhombic arrays and derived their stability properties. The\ntheoretical prediction is in good qualitative agreement with\nexperimental prediction of stability.\nIn other cases, speci\u00d0c models have been developed for par-\nticular reactions and then solved numerically. For example,\nthe following empirical rate law model for the CIMA reaction\nhas been proposed by Lengyel and co-workers.58h60\nFig. 5 Patterns generated by the Schnakenberg model.57 (Reprinted\nwith kind permission from ref. 57.)\nModelling of the CIMA reaction\nThe model proposed by Lengyel and Epstein stresses three\nprocesses : the reaction between malonic acid (MA) and iodine\nto create iodide, the reaction between chlorine dioxide and\niodide, and the reaction between chlorite and iodide. The\nmodel has the form:\nMA] I2 ] IMA ] I~] H` r1 \\\nk1[MA][I2]\nw1] [I2]\nClO2 ] I~] ClO2~] 12I2 r2 \\ k2[ClO2][I~]\nClO2~] 4I~] 4H`] Cl~] 2I2] 2H2O\nr3\\ k3a[ClO2~][I~][H`]] k3b\n[ClO2~][I2][I~]\nw3] [I~]2\nwhere [] denote chemical concentration and k1 , k2 , k3a , k3b ,and are positive constants. Parameter values can bew1 w3determined experimentally.58,59\nThe reaction rates and are derived empirically andr1, r2 r3lead to a set of \u00d0ve coupled di\u2020erential equations, with \u00d0ve\nvariables corresponding to the concentration [MA], [I2],[I~] and[ClO2], [ClO2~].Numerical simulation of the above system yields oscillatory\nbehaviour in close agreement with that observed experimen-\ntally.53,61\nNumerical and theoretical analysis of the full, \u00d0ve-variable\nmodel with spatial (di\u2020usive) terms is a computationally\ndemanding task. As a \u00d0rst approximation, a more manageable\ntwo variable model has been derived60 by making the experi-\nmentally realistic assumption that the concentrations of\nmalonic acid, chlorine dioxide and iodine are constant.\nA key problem faced when obtaining experimental veri\u00d0ca-\ntion of Turing structures is the required variation of di\u2020usion\nJ. Chem. Soc., Faraday T rans., 1997, V ol. 93 3605\ncoefficients. Di\u2020usion of the inhibitor must be larger than dif-\nfusion of the activator for Turing instabilities to develop. The\nreactants above, however, have similar di\u2020usion rates.\nLengyel and Epstein60 have suggested that reactions\noccurring between the iodide and the gel or starch may serve\nto reduce the di\u2020usion rate of the activator. They demonstrate\nmathematically (see below) how an e\u2020ect of this nature may\nserve to increase the ratio of di\u2020usion coefficients sufficiently\nfor Turing structures to develop and apply this approach to\nthe CIMA reaction. The model, referred to as the Lengyel\u00c8\nEpstein or \u201cBrandeisator \u00cf model is\nLu1\nLt\n\\ k1[ u [\n4u1u2\n1 ] u12\n] +2u1\nLu2\nLt\n\\ k2\nC\nk3\nA\nu1[\nu1u2\n1 ] u12\nB\n] c+2u2\nD\nwhere are the concentrations of iodide and chlorite,u1, u2respectively, and and c are positive constants.k1, k2 , k3Numerical simulations of the above model under realistic\nparameter values yield di\u2020usion-driven stationary patterns\nwith a wavelength calculated at ca. 0.15 mm. This is close to\nthe experimental wavelength of 0.2 mm. Numerical simula-\ntions of the above model demonstrate Turing structures qual-\nitatively similar to the structures observed in the experimental\nsystem.62\nThe e\u2020ect of starch and\/or the gel has been con\u00d0rmed in\nseveral experiments. For example, in experiments where no\nreaction occurs between gel and iodine the presence of starch\nis essential for the development of structures. Details of the\nvarious reactions can be found in ref. 63\u00c865.\nAt a low starch concentration the reaction demonstrates\ntravelling wave trains as opposed to Turing structures. This\nsuggests that the system has been shifted to the oscillatory\nstate. Indeed, this is as we should expect, as in the absence of\nspatial di\u2020usion the model predicts oscillatory behaviour. The\ne\u2020ect of the starch is to shift the reaction from oscillatory\nbehaviour to Turing structures. This idea has enabled investi-\ngators to examine the transition from oscillatory to Turing\nstructures.66\nModi\u00d0cation of the di\u2020usion ratio\nAs mentioned above, a key problem in the veri\u00d0cation of\nTuring structures is the required variation of di\u2020usion coeffi-\ncients. For a general reaction di\u2020usion system, the ratio may\nbe changed as follows :67 consider a standard two-species reac-\ntion di\u2020usion system of the form\nLu\nLt\n\\ f (u, v)] D\nu\n+2u,\nLv\nLt\n\\ g(u, v) ] D\nv\n+2v.\nWe make the additional assumption that the activator is\ninvolved in a reaction of the form:\nU ] S \u00bd C\nAssuming that both S and C are immobile, the RD system is\nnow modi\u00d0ed to :\nLu\nLt\n\\ f (u, v) [ r1us ] r2 c] Du+2u\nLv\nLt\n\\ g(u, v) ] D\nv\n+2v\nLc\nLt\n\\ r1us [ r2 c\nwhere s and c are the concentrations of S and C, respectively,\nand is the forward (reverse) rate of reaction in the newr1 (r2)reaction. If and are large, then using singular pertur-r1 r2bation theory, c can be approximated in terms of u by c4 ru,\nwhere and we have assumed that the concentra-r \\ s0 r1\/r2tion of S remains close to its initial value, s0 .On addition of the \u00d0rst and third equations above, we\nobtain the following equation for the activator :\n(1 ] r)\nLu\nLt\n\\ f (u, v) ] D\nu\n+2u\nThus when the di\u2020usion of the activator is greatlyr A 1\nreduced.\nThis demonstrates how the formation of an immobile\ncomplex can reduce the e\u2020ective di\u2020usion rate of the activator\nspecies. It was this type of approach that was \u00d0rst used by\nLengyel and Epstein53,60 to explain how Turing structures\ndevelop in the CIMA reaction. In this case, starch forms a\nstable complex with triiodide ions via the reaction\nS ] I~] I2 \u00bd SI3~ K \\\n[SI3~]\n[S][I2][I~]\nand the high molecular weight of the complex reduces the rate\nof di\u2020usion.\nVeri\u00d0cation of the wavelength rule in Turing systems\nA characteristic of Turing patterns is the intrinsic relationship\nbetween the average di\u2020usion coefficient of the reactants and\nthe wavelength of the pattern. This characteristic di\u2020erentiates\nTuring patterns from other patterning phenomena. Turing\ndemonstrated that near the bifurcation from a uniform steady\nstate to Turing patterns, the wavelength of the pattern is pre-\ndicted to be (2nT D)1@2, where and areD\\ (D1D2)1@2, D1, D2the di\u2020usion coefficients. T is the period of the limit cycle\nwhen the system is at the onset of Hopf bifurcations\n(temporally varying pattern).\nUsing two types of gel, and varying the concentrations of\nthe gels, it is possible to test experimentally if Turing\u00cfs rule is\nobeyed for the CIMA reaction.68 With the above variations,\npattern wavelengths can be measured when D is varied over a\nfactor of three. The corresponding plot of average di\u2020usion\ncoefficient against the experimental wavelength con\u00d0rms\nTuring\u00cfs prediction. Experimental measurement of the period\nof limit cycles at the onset of Hopf bifurcations is also in good\nagreement with the theoretical predictions.\nOther models\nPearson69 has performed numerical simulations on the model\nof Gray and Scott,49h51 a variation on the Selkov model of\nglycolysis,70 which has the form f1(u1, u2) \\ u1[ u1u22] k1(1where and[ u1), f2(u1, u2) \\ u2 ] u1u22 [ (k1 ] k2)u2 k1 k2are constants. Two-dimensional simulations reveal a variety of\ntime-dependent and time-independent phenomena for various\nparameter values. The \u201c lamallae \u00cf-type patterns observed in ref.\n46 and shown in Fig. 4 are found for some regions of the\nparameter space. The simulations also predicted the self-\nreplicating spots (see Plate 2) later found experimentally in ref.\n46.\nA four species presentation of the FIS reaction has been\ndeveloped from an earlier model that considered ten\nspecies.71,72 Lee and Swinney73 have performed numerical\nsimulations on the reduced model and compared results with\nexperimental data. Numerical simulations show one-\ndimensional phenomena that compare well with many of the\nexperimental results concerned, including the lamallae and\nself-replication process.\n3606 J. Chem.

(Reprinted with kind permission from\nref. 69.)\nComparison of experimental results and theoretical\npredictions\nIn Table 1 we present a comparison of Turing-type patterns\nobserved in experiments with those observed in numerical\nsimulations. The numerical simulations are not necessarily\nmodels of the speci\u00d0c reaction mentioned. This table is by no\nmeans exhaustive, but serves to provide a guide to some of the\nrecent research in the area. (For example, it is known that\nmany theoretical models can exhibit stripes, or spots or hex-\nagonal structures. Here we list only a few examples.)\nIn the table we have used the following abbreviations :\nPBC\\ periodic boundary conditions ; 0FBC\\ zero \u00d1ux\nboundary conditions, IC \\ initial conditions and\nRIC \\ random initial conditions.\nSome open questions in chemical applications\nThe theoretical study of spatial patterning in real chemical\nsystems requires a highly reduced model of the full system.\nOne example is the two-species model of the CIMA reaction\ndeveloped by Lengyel and Epstein. While capturing basic ele-\nments of pattern formation, such models are unlikely to\ncapture full features of the experimental system. Standard\nlinear analysis of even a three-species RD model reveals a far\ngreater array of patterning phenomena than the two-species\nmodel.76 Exploration of a more detailed RD model of the\nCIMA reaction may therefore reveal behaviour not previously\nreported in the reaction. Examples include the Turing\u00c8Hopf\n(or spatial\u00c8Hopf) bifurcation in which the resulting spatial\npatterns oscillate in both space and time, the interaction of\nTuring\u00c8Hopf and Turing-type patterns, and the interaction of\ntwo Turing-type patterns. The \u00d0ve-species model of the CIMA\nreaction may demonstrate phenomena of this nature and, sub-\nsequently, experimental study would be of great interest.\nSome of the phenomena obtained experimentally have yet\nto be found in numerical simulations. An example is the\nblack-eye patterns reported in the CIMA reaction. Although\nsymmetry arguments have been used to describe these pat-\nterns theoretically, no numerical simulations have reported\nthis feature as of date. Numerical simulations of these patterns\nwould provide valuable information on the extent of\noccurrence.\nThe rhombic arrays have only been numerical simulated\nwith other chemical kinetics, for example, Schnakenberg.2\nSimulation of rhomboids with the Lengyel\u00c8Epstein model of\nthe CIMA reaction may provide deeper understanding on\nhow one can generate such patterns experimentally.

The demonstration of rhombic arrays with the Sch-\nnakenberg kinetics indicates that they may appear in a wide\nvariety of chemical reactions that have the ability to develop\nTuring structures.\nThe role of boundary and initial conditions has received\nscant attention to date. Patterns can be highly in\u00d1uenced by\nthe e\u2020ect of di\u2020erent boundary conditions, especially when the\nlength of the domain is of the order of a few wavelengths.\nUnderstanding how one can impose speci\u00d0c boundary condi-\ntions in experiments may provide greater understanding on\nthe role of boundary conditions in determining pattern struc-\nture.\nBiological pattern formation\nBroadly speaking, there are two main models for spatial\npattern formation in biology : (i) chemical pre-pattern models ;\nand (ii) cell movement models. In (i), it is hypothesized that\ncells respond to a chemical pre-pattern and di\u2020erentiate\naccording to the concentration of chemical that they experi-\nence. The chemical pre-pattern may be set up by a simple\nsource-sink mechanism,77 or by the more complicated RD\nmechanism. Although the pattern forming process in the\nformer is simpler, the interpretation mechanism required by\ncells would be more complex than in the latter.78 In (ii), it is\nassumed that owing to mechanical forces and chemical cues,\ncells form a spatial pattern and cells in high density aggregate\nthen di\u2020erentiate.79h85\nBoth the above models, therefore, are based on fundamen-\ntally di\u2020erent biological assumptions. However, RD and\nmechanochemical models share many common features math-\nematically. Thus far, mechanochemical models have only been\ninvestigated in detail in one-dimension near primary bifur-\ncation points and have been shown to exhibit patterns similar\nto those of the Turing models. Some limited two-dimensional\nanalysis again reveals patterns similar to those observed in\nTuring models. More extensive investigation of the patterning\nproperties of these models is required in order to determine if\nthey can exhibit fundamentally di\u2020erent types of structures.\nSuch predictions could then be used to di\u2020erentiate experi-\nmentally between the two mechanisms.\nWhich mechanism operates is an area of huge controversy.\nIn recent years certain candidates have been put forward as\nmorphogens, most notably, retinoic acid,86 but its role in\nmorphogenesis is still unclear. There are many examples\nwhere chemical patterns or cell aggregations are observed but\nit is still a question of great debate as to whether these are the\ncause of morphogenesis, or its e\u2020ect. A detailed comparison\nand critical review of theoretical models for, and experimental\nresults on, the skeletal pattern in the developing chick limb is\ngiven in ref. 87.\nWe concentrate, in this article, on Turing models for bio-\nlogical pattern formation. These models have been applied to\ndiverse patterning phenomena too vast to be listed here, so we\nfocus on only a few applications for which recent biological\nevidence suggests that the Turing model needs to be radically\nmodi\u00d0ed. One of the most widely studied applications has\nbeen to the patterning of body segments in the fruit \u00d1y Dro-\nsophila.5,88h93 Later numerical studies94 showed that the pat-\nterns produced by the model system were crucially sensitive to\nthe geometry of the domain\u00c8slight perturbations in the shape\nof the domain resulted in a completely di\u2020erent pattern. This,\nof course, is a major drawback for the model application.\nMore recently, detailed experimental work on Drosophila has\nshown that the pattern forming process is not, in fact, via reac-\ntion di\u2020usion, but due to a cascade of gene switching, where\ncertain gene proteins are expressed and, in turn, in\u00d1uence sub-\nsequent gene expression patterns. Therefore, although RD\ntheory provides a very elegant mechanism for segmentation,\nnature appears to have chosen a much less elegant way of\ndoing it !\nThe formation of skeletal pattern in the limb has been the\nfocus of a great deal of experimental and theoretical research.\nRecently, it has been shown that a number of Hox genes are\nswitched on in a precise spatiotemporal manner in the\ndeveloping chick limb. Although these are exciting advances,\nthey still beg the question of how this patterning of activity is\ninitiated. RD theory, as a model for the generation of such\nrobust processes as digit formation, has been heavily criticised.\nFor example, Bard and Lauder,95 showed that the qualitative\nform of the model solutions could be greatly in\u00d1uenced by\nminor perturbations in the system. In such an application, an\nessential requirement for a model is that it must be able to\nproduce a limited number of patterns in a very robust way. In\nthis respect, RD theory is too sophisticated because it exhibits\na vast variety of patterns, many of which are never observed.\nHence, one is forced to turn the question of pattern formation\non its head and ask, how can one not generate so much\npattern? We have addressed this issue by investigating the\nrole of boundary conditions. The key point here is that certain\ntypes of boundary conditions preclude many patterns from\nforming while extending the domains of stability of the\nremaining patterns. This has been shown for an RD system in\none dimension.96 Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the patterns\nformed under zero \u00d1ux boundary conditions with conditions\nin which the boundary is a sink for one of the morphogens.\nThe model now selects only patterns that are internal to the\ndomain, and exhibits a patterning sequence that is consistent\nwith that observed in the limb. The insight gained here then, is\nthat the boundary plays an active role in the patterning\nmechanism, rather than simply being a passive impermeable\nmembrane.\nIn 1990, Wolpert and Hornbruch97 performed an experi-\nment in an attempt to prove that limb development in chick\u00cfs\ncould not possibly arise as a consequence of an RD or\nmechanochemical mechanism. They removed the posterior\nhalf of a host limb bud and replaced it by the anterior half of\na donor limb bud so that the resultant double-anterior recom-\nbinant limb bud was the same size as a normal limb bud. This\nexperiment was performed at a sufficiently early stage in\ndevelopment that no pattern was visible. The limbs developed\ntwo humeri instead of one. This contradicted both models,\ndue to the fact that the model solutions are size-dependent,\nthat is, if the domain size is unaltered, the patterns produced\nare unaltered.\nIn an attempt to rescue the theory, we assumed that the\ndi\u2020usion coefficient of the morphogens varied across the limb.\nThe idea here was that, as di\u2020usion and length scale are inti-\nmately linked, a varying di\u2020usion coefficient essentially sets up\nan internal scaling, where the length scale in one part of the\nFig. 6 Patterns produced by a reaction-di\u2020usion system for di\u2020erent\ntypes of boundary conditions. In (a), the boundary conditions are zero\n\u00d1ux for each chemical and the model predicts patterns at the bound-\nary. In (b), one chemical is \u00d0xed to zero concentration at the bound-\nary. In this case, the patterns form internal to the domain (see ref. 96\nfor details). (Reprinted with kind permission from ref. 96.)\n3608 J. Chem. Soc., Faraday T rans., 1997, V ol. 93\ndomain is so small that it cannot support Turing structures.\nTherefore, although combining two anterior halves results in a\nlimb bud of normal size, it might actually consist of doubling\nthe patterning sub-domain and hence in more complicated\npatterns. The prediction of the modelling was that there must\nbe a variation of di\u2020usion across the anterior\u00c8posterior axis of\nthe chick limb.98,99 This actually turned out to be a\n\u201cpostdiction\u00cf as experimental results show that gap junction\npermeability varies across the anterior\u00c8posterior axis of the\nchick limb.100,101\nOne of the most colourful applications of RD is in mamma-\nlian coat markings.102,103 In these applications, the qualit-\native features of the patterns do not change as the animal\ngrows. Recently, Kondo and Asai104 considered the time evol-\nution of skin patterns on the angel\u00d0sh. On many species of\nthis \u00d0sh the juvenile exhibits vertical striped patterns. As it\ngrows, the stripes move apart, and other stripes emerge\nbetween existing stripes to restore the original spatial wave-\nlength of the patterning process. They showed that, at least on\na one-dimensional domain, an RD model could exhibit pat-\nterns consistent with these observations. However, a numeri-\ncal study of these equations on a two-dimensional domain\nreveals that these vertical stripes lose stability as the domain\ngrows.105,106 Kondo and Asai,107 argue that there is an addi-\ntional cue that selects vertical stripes rather than horizontal\nstripes or spots. However, the waters are muddied here by the\nobservation that in most cases the adult does exhibit horizon-\ntal stripes or spots ! This warrants more detailed investigation.\nA crucial property of the patterns on the juvenile angel\u00d0sh\nthat was not addressed in ref. 104 and 105 is that the stripes\nthat emerge between the existing stripes are thinner than the\nexisting ones. This cannot be explained by a Turing mecha-\nnism. Recently, we have been considering a hybrid RD\u00c8cell-\nmovement model wherein we assume that an RD mechanism\nsets up a pre-pattern in morphogen concentration, to which\ncells respond by moving chemotactically, that is, in response\nto chemical gradients (this is a well known phenomenon). Pre-\nliminary investigations on this model show that it can gener-\nate patterns with alternating thick and thin stripes.106\nThe \u00d0nal application we consider here also involves domain\ngrowth. It concerns the development of tooth primordia in the\njaw of the alligator, Alligator mississippiensis. This is a\ncomplex process which has been the source of detailed experi-\nmental investigation,108h110 so there is ample experimental\ndata on which to base a realistic mathematical model. As the\njaw has left\u00c8right symmetry, one need consider only one side\nof the jaw. To a very good approximation, the jaw can be\nconsidered as one-dimensional. Teeth arise as the result of\ntooth primordia, which are clumps of cells in the jaw mesen-\nchyme that mark where future teeth will form. The \u00d0rst seven\ntooth primordia form along the posterior\u00c8anterior axis in the\nsequence 7\u00c83\u00c86\u00c82\u00c85\u00c81\u00c84. That is, the \u00d0rst primordium forms\nnear the anterior end of the jaw, the second forms posterior to\nthe \u00d0rst and the third forms posterior to the second. The\nfourth primordium, however, forms anterior to the \u00d0rst, and 5,\n6 and 7 form in a posterior sequence. This complex sequence\ncannot be generated by the standard Turing model on a\ngrowing domain.\nWe have considered a modi\u00d0ed Turing system which\nincorporates the biological observation that when a tooth pri-\nmordium forms, it inhibits, for a certain length of time, neigh-\nbouring primordium formation. We consider a third chemical,\na control chemical, which we assume is secreted by primordia\nand a\u2020ects the morphogen kinetics. Numerical simulations\nshow that this model exhibits spatiotemporal morphogen\ndynamics consistent with the pattern of primordia observed\nexperimentally.111 To tie this in with the cell aggregations\nobserved, we make the further hypothesis that cells respond to\nthe morphogen pre-pattern by moving to areas of high mor-\nphogen concentration.\nSome open questions in biological applications\nMost theoretical work on RD theory has focused on solving\nthe system on a \u00d0xed one-dimensional domain with zero-\u00d1ux\nboundary conditions and constant parameters. This is the\neasy case but only scratches the surface of the study of these\nsystems. In a biological context, parameters themselves will\nvary over space and time, boundary conditions will be more\ncomplicated than zero \u00d1ux and two crucial di\u2020erences to the\ncase of the chemical systems discussed above are that the\ndomains do not have simple geometry and that they grow.\nAlthough RD theory has been around as a model for morpho-\ngenesis for over 40 years, there are precious few cases in which\nthe model has been shown to exhibit patterns consistent with\nthose observed in nature for the case of realistic geometry and\ndomain growth in two and three dimensions. This is remark-\nable when one considers that the \u00d0rst necessary step for any\nmodel is that it must be shown to exhibit the phenomena it\npurports to model. Of course, part of the problem has been\nthe lack of computer power necessary to carry out a thorough\nnumerical investigation of the model.\nIt has been shown recently that the form of the nonlinearity\nin the chemical kinetics determines whether the model exhibits\nspots or stripes.112h114 Other key questions to address are the\ne\u2020ects of di\u2020erent types of non-linear kinetics, boundary con-\nditions, domain growth, and domain geometry, on the selec-\ntion and stabilization of patterns.\nOn the biological side, the crucial question still concerns the\nunequivocal identi\u00d0cation of morphogens. We still seem a\nlong way from that goal. It is also necessary for the theory,\nwhere possible, to make experimentally testable predictions.\nConclusion\nThe recent discovery of spatial pattern formation in chemistry,\nsome 40 years after Turing\u00cfs prediction, has revitalised the\n\u00d0eld and led to a great deal of interest in the properties of\nTuring models. Biology is still lagging behind, which is hardly\nsurprising as it is on yet another level of complexity. However,\nthe application of Turing models to biological pattern forma-\ntion, and the interaction between model predictions and\nexperimental observations, have led to model modi\u00d0cations\nthat, in turn, suggest new insights to the underlying biological\nmechanisms at work. With the enormous advances in biotech-\nnology and computer power, the \u00d0eld seems poised on a\nthreshold of new discoveries.\nacknowledges receipt of an Engineering and PhysicalK.J.P.\nSciences Research Committee (EPSRC) research studentship.\nWe thank an anonymous referee for a number of very helpful\ncomments including the analogy on page 1.
