However, the influence of Hcy on platelets, cells central to the atherothrombotic process, has never been addressed directly in patient studies. Here, the influence of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia (hHcy) on platelet function was explored in patients with peripheral occlusive arterial disease as evidence by intermittent claudication. Claudicants (n=39) were assigned to one of two subgroups depending on their plasma Hcy concentrations. hHcy claudicants had plasma Hcy concentrations of 18.9\u00b11.0 \u00bfM (n=24), compared to 11.3\u00b10.5 \u00bfM for normohomocysteinemic (nHcy) claudicants (n=15) and 12.6\u00b10.7 \u00bfM for age-matched controls (n=15).\\ud\n\\ud\nPlatelet function was evaluated ex vivo in both groups and compared to age-matched controls.
