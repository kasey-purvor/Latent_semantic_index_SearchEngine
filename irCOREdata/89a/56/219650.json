All published papers have passed the rigorous peer-review process usual for \nsubmissions to Energy Policy. In this Introduction we briefly set out the current financial \nand political context for the interest of North African states in alternative energy futures, \nthen summarise the key themes of the papers featured in this special issue. \n \nNon-hydrocarbon energy investment and cooperation in North Africa \nClean energy investment (renewables and energy efficiency) is proving resilient in the \nwake of the global economic downturn: at $162 billion in 2009, new investment in clean \nenergy was only 7% down on 2008 and still the second highest ever total, with new \ncapacity spending exceeding that for fossil fuels (UNEP\/SEFI\/Bloomberg 2010: 10). The \nmajority of this new investment was in asset financing of utility-scale projects, with a \nsignificant (13%) increase in new builds for wind energy, as against a 25% decline in new \nbuilds for solar energy. Relatively little of the new global investment in clean energy has \nmade its way to the North African states, and given their policy commitments to renewable \nenergy, the scaling up of such investment is a major challenge over the next decade. \nNone of the three Maghreb countries discussed in this special issue had new clean energy \ninvestment exceeding $100 million in 2009. In contrast, Egypt saw $500 million of clean \nenergy investment, the great bulk of which was committed to a 200MW wind project in the \nGulf of El Zayt (UNEP\/SEFI\/Bloomberg 2010: 35). As Suding notes in his paper, though, \nthe Egyptian plan to have renewable energy contribute 20% of national power generation \nby 2020 requires, from the wind sector, an average growth in capacity of 600MW per year. \nSimilarly, while Morocco has announced plans to invest $9 billion in 2GW of solar energy \ncapacity over the next ten years, the public and private financing needed to achieve this \nhas still to be secured (see the papers in this special issue by Fritzsche and T\u00e4nzler). \n \nOf course, the investment potential to the North African states of new energy sources rests \nlargely on their long-term cost advantages relative to the import costs (and, where \nrelevant, export revenues) attached to fossil fuels. In recent years, a preference in the \nregion for onshore wind technology over solar energy (whether solar thermal electricity \ngeneration or photovoltaic) reflects its status as the cheapest renewable source of \nelectricity, as evident in wind farm commissioning and development in Egypt and Morocco \n(Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2010). However, the costs of photovoltaic modules are \nfalling and, as noted in the paper by Peter Viebahn and colleagues, major reductions in \nenergy generating costs are also forecast for solar thermal technologies as a result of \nmajor investments in concentrated solar power (CSP) with associated technological and \nefficiency gains. In their paper Marktanner and Salman note that the financial viability of \nnuclear power is questionable for the North African states, but the technology is attractive \nfor political and wider economic development reasons. For example, in Egypt, the recent \ncommissioning of a 1200MW nuclear power plant is seen as a means of meeting rising \ndomestic energy demand while protecting the export value of its substantial natural gas \nreserves. While Egypt has significant uranium ore deposits, the other North African \ncountries do not currently have economically viable sources of uranium, so will likely have \nto import reactor fuel if they choose to adopt nuclear power (see the papers by \nSupersberger and Jewell).  \n \nA major constraint on the development of low-carbon futures in North Africa is the low level \nof regional cooperation on renewable and nuclear energy technologies. There are at least \nsymbolic commitments: since the 2001 Abu Dhabi Declaration issued by the Council of \nArab Ministers Responsible for the Environment, a number of high-level meetings have \ntaken place under the Middle East and North Africa Renewable Energy Conference \n(MENAREC): the MENAREC 4 meeting in Damascus, June 2007, released a declaration \ncalling on Arab countries to set national targets for renewable energy deployment and \nenergy efficiency, and expressed support for regional renewable energy systems. \nSimilarly, in July 2008 the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) affirmed its strong support for \nrenewable energy cooperation and called for the creation of a regional Maghreb electricity \nmarket, open to competition. The same meeting also saw a commitment to cooperate over \nthe development of nuclear power for peaceful use in the Maghreb (Union of the Arab \nMaghreb 2008). In practice, though, the North African states have not moved significantly \nbeyond technical and legal discussions, stopping short of the scale of coordination needed \nfor the regional production and distribution of low-carbon energy. This reflects the both the \njealous guarding of their sovereign powers and the existence of wider political tensions \nthat serve to frustrate effective regional cooperation (e.g. tensions between Morocco and \nAlgeria over the status of Western Sahara). \n \nNew opportunities for increased regional coordination arise, firstly, from efforts to upgrade \nand integrate the energy grid infrastructure in North Africa, as noted in the paper by Brand \nand Zingerle. The UMA electricity generators and distributors are grouped within the \nComit\u00e9 Maghrebin de l'Electricit\u00e9 (COMELEC). While the COMLELEC grid infrastructure \nhas underdeveloped transmission networks and lines, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are \nalready linked to the European electricity system (through a 400kV connection between \nMorocco and Spain with a current capacity of 1400MW) with plans for a 400kV \ntransmission line between Tunisia and Italy (ELMED-cable; 800-1200 MW capacity): \nattempts are also underway to forge a Tunisia-Libyan connection to facilitate \nsynchronisation with Libya, Egypt and the Arab states in the Levant (Bloomberg New \nEnergy Finance 2010: 11). According to European advocates of renewable energy, the \nemergence of a Mediterranean Electricity Ring can facilitate the mass importation of \nelectricity to the European Union from the North African states, increasing the economic \nviability for investment in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants within the Maghreb \nregion. This is essentially the vision of the Mediterranean Solar Plan and Desertec \ninitiative: in this issue Viebahn et al. assess the relevant technological and cost \nparameters of long-term scenarios for the development of CSP systems, while Folkmanis \nexamines the potential role of carbon markets in inducing the large-scale investments \nrequired. At the same time, improvements to electricity transmission capacity may make \nnuclear power generation more attractive in North African countries, though Supersberger \nargues in this special issue that effective domestic integration of the power capacity \ninvolved is not technically feasible for at least 15 to 20 years.  \n \nSecondly, the absence of strategic energy policy cooperation amongst the North African \nstates has created opportunities for structural interventions by external actors in favour of \nalternative energy sources. With regard to renewables, the European Union is heavily \npromoting the idea of an integrated power grid involving the purchase of North African \nsolar energy, which is also backed by multilateral development banks (e.g. European \nInvestment Bank) and major corporate coalitions (e.g. the Desertec Industrial Initiative and \nthe Transgreen\/MedGrid intiative: see Fritzsche et al.). The commitment of European \nactors to the liberalisation of national and regional energy markets serves as a \nconditionality on their promise to undertake low-carbon energy investments in North \nAfrican states. Indeed, the energy regimes of the states neighbouring the EU have been \nunder strong pressure to adopt European acquis communautaire into their national \nlegislation. As noted in this issue by Suding and Fritzsche et al., Egypt and Morocco have \nalready responded to such signals with energy law reforms featuring long-term power \npurchase agreements, competitive private sector bidding, and moves to institutionalise \nfeed-in tariffs for renewable energy. Similarly, the need of North African states for external \nassistance in the development of nuclear power means their acceptance of political \nconditionalities to restrict its use to peaceful means. Thus, Egypt\u2019s close cooperation with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency in supporting its plans to develop a nuclear power \nstation, and the nuclear power accords signed in 2008 by France with Algeria and Libya \nwhich closely control the relevant technology transfer and training. \n \nThirdly, amongst at least some of the North African states, shared perceptions of energy \ninsecurity provide an incentive for enhanced cooperation over the development of \nalternative energy sources. In their paper, Brand and Zingerle forecast a rapidly increasing \npower demand for the Maghreb region, with total electricity generation almost tripling by \n2025 for Morocco Algeria and Tunisia. Thus, even assuming success in meeting relatively \nambitious targets for renewable energy (and not considering longer-term plans for nuclear \nenergy), a heavy dependence on fossil fuels is at best significantly reduced rather \neliminated within the next fifteen years. Indeed, Brand and Zingerle predict that, if \nintegrated into the European power market, the Maghreb region will remain a net importer \nof electricity by 2025 partly because of the availability of lower-cost electricity from Spain. \nThe rising domestic energy demands of the North African states reveals that, at least in \nthe short-term, their own plans for greater energy security may clash with European Union \ngoals to source North African solar electricity as a means of reducing its high energy \ndependence on Russia (Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2010: 11). However, in their \npaper Lacher and Kumetat identify more positively a transnational concept of energy \nsecurity fostered by the growing energy interconnectedness between North Africa and \nEurope. They are also reject claims that renewable energy infrastructure is more \nvulnerable than fossil fuel counterparts to insurgent attacks by non-state actors (e.g. by \nAlgerian Islamist militants). \n \n \nThe papers  \nThe special issue begins with two papers exploring future scenarios of renewable energy \nuse for North Africa, both including consideration of the effects of the progressive \nintegration of the Maghreb electricity grid into the European energy system. Brand and \nZingerle apply a linear electricity optimisation model to evaluate the impact of Maghreb \nrenewable energy targets on their energy generation systems by 2025. Their focus on \nMorocco, Algeria and Tunisia reflects, in the context of North Africa, both the more \nambitious renewable energy goals of these countries as well as their greater moves to \nenergy market liberalisation. According to Brand and Zingerle, the realisation of their \nrenewable targets would lead in the short-term to substantial additional supply costs for \nregional power markets, which can partly be offset for Morocco and Algeria by increasing \nthe share of wind over solar power in their renewable energy planning. In their paper, \nViebahn, Lechon and Trieb extend the scenario horizon to 2050 and focus on the potential \nrole of CSP. Here the cost development of renewable energy technologies becomes more \nfavourable over the long-term, because of the technological and efficiency savings that are \nexpected to accompany a major scaling up of investments. \n \nSuding provides the first of the country-specific studies in this special issue with an in-\ndepth analysis of Egyptian energy policy. Using as a benchmark the energy policy strategy \nadopted in 2007 by the governing National Democratic Party, which prioritises long-term \nenergy sufficiency and supply security, he reveals a number of challenges to the effective \ndelivery of this strategy. Major difficulties have included political opposition to market-led \nreforms on energy pricing and also to greater investment in renewable energy schemes. \nThe paper indicates the implementation gap that typically faces North African regimes \nwhose political legitimacy derives at least in part from subsidised energy pricing for \nconsumers and the capture of resource rents by governing elites. \n \nIn her article, Jewell provides an overview of the other non-hydrocarbon energy future for \nNorth Africa \u2013 nuclear power. All North African countries have announced plans to develop \nnuclear power and Jewell estimates that nuclear energy could supply up to 9-15% of all \nelectricity consumption in the region by 2030. She locates this nuclear power interest in \nthe rapidly growing energy demand of the region and concerns with energy security. \nHowever, as noted by Jewell and also by Supersberger in the following article, a move to \nnuclear power by the North African states would create new external dependencies \nbecause of the need to import nuclear fuels and technologies. Supersberger considers \nnuclear power in relation to renewable energy options, making necessary distinctions \nbetween the greater energy insecurity of Morocco and Tunisia and the continuing fossil \nfuel export interests of Egypt, Libya and Algeria. He also argues that separate \nassessments are necessary for the different options available within nuclear and \nrenewable energy technologies. After examining the various energy import and export \neffects of alternative energy futures, he concludes that the North African states have more \nopportunity for developing domestic industries in clean energy by embracing renewable \nenergy technologies. \n \nThe next two papers widen out the criteria for assessing alternative energy futures by \nincluding political and hard security considerations. Lacher and Kumetat address the \nsecurity of energy infrastructure in North Africa by comparing the vulnerability of \nhydrocarbon and renewable energy supply networks - including the potential threat to \nEuropean states from deliberate supply disruptions by North African governments. Their \narticle investigates the political and security profile of the growing role of renewable energy \ntechnologies in the North African energy supply portfolio. They treat as exaggerated some \nof the European security anxieties concerning large-scale renewable energy imports from \nNorth Africa, notably the possibility of supply stoppages as a result of the actions of state \nor non-state actors. Marktanner and Salman apply a similarly broad scale of geopolitical \nanalysis to encompass nuclear energy choices in relation to renewable energy, inviting \nscholars to consider the embeddedness of energy choices in the political power structures \nof the North African countries. For example, the adoption of nuclear energy is seen as \npromising for reasons of political regime preservation, but forecast to be harmful in terms \nof economic development and political liberalisation. \n \nIn his paper Folkmanis questions whether there are sufficient international and European \nmarket incentives to encourage export-led investment in North African renewable energy. \nDespite European involvement in the Mediterranean Solar Plan, Folkmanis notes that the \n2009 EU renewable energy directive requires the physical exchange of electrical power, \nmilitating against the type of \u2018virtual trading\u2019 in clean energy promoted under the \nUNFCCC\/Kyoto flexibility mechanisms. This restricts scope for the use of the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism in supporting energy trading between North Africa and Europe. \nMoreover, with the strong domestic expansion of renewable energy in Europe, there is \nalso a question whether there would be an adequate market for bulk imports of clean \ngenerated electricity from North Africa. Folkmanis concludes that only an increase to 30% \n(by 2020) of the share of energy from renewable sources within the EU will provide the \nnecessary impetus for strong external investment in renewable energy in North Africa; \nand, he adds, this needs to be accompanied by a modification of EU legislation to allow \nvirtual energy trading. \n \nCompleting this special issue are two other country case studies, although both papers \ndraw more general lessons for navigating alternative energy futures in North Africa. \nFritzsche, T\u00e4nzler and Zejli explore energy governance issues, in particular various \ninstitutional conditions (policy, financing, infrastructure, knowledge and partnerships) for \npromoting the uptake of renewable energy. As a North African front-runner with regard to \nrenewable energy implementation, including active membership of relevant regional and \ninternational initiatives, the experience of Morocco is discussed in order to highlight \ninstitutional barriers and opportunities facing low carbon development pathways. Fritzsche \net al. identify major failings in the regional coordination of clean energy governance and \nprovide concrete recommendations for promoting renewable energy adoption. In the last \npaper Stambouli similarly addresses governance conditions for accelerating renewable \nenergy development in Algeria, which nevertheless stands in a different position from \nMorocco on account of its significant oil and gas resources and associated export \nrevenues. Algeria holds one of the highest solar energy reservoirs in the world, and there \nis a high-level political commitment to develop renewable energy sources. As in the \nMoroccan case, though, there are major institutional challenges to such development: \nStambouli stresses the need for a close alignment of strategic policy choices and \ntechnology investments in clean energy. \n \n \nConclusion \nThe papers in this special issue are united by a scholarly interest in energy futures for \nNorth Africa rather than a shared manifesto of policy prescriptions for a clean energy \ntransition in the region. Their different thematic and empirical perspectives nevertheless \nhighlight significant barriers facing the increased uptake of non-hydrocarbon energy \ngeneration, including outdated power sector infrastructures, investment and technological \nconstraints, minimal regional coordination of energy policies, and trading restrictions on \nrenewable energy exchanges. At the same time, the papers also identify emerging \nopportunities for a significant growth in the regional adoption of low-carbon energy. We \nwould argue that a careful assessment of renewable- and nuclear energy options for North \nAfrica should rest on criteria that, above all, reflect the long-term human development \nneeds of domestic publics rather than European energy security imperatives. So much the \nbetter if the two interest domains overlap, but this should not be taken for granted. \n \nThere is also scope for greater acknowledgment by low carbon energy advocates of the \nsubstantial economic and political inertia accompanying fossil fuel energy use (and \nproduction) in North Africa. Hydrocarbon energy infrastructures have sunk capital costs \nwhich dwarf existing investments in low-carbon energies. And with its rapidly increasing \nenergy demand, the Maghreb region will remain a net importer of oil and gas in 2025 even \nif those countries with the most advanced renewable energy goals (Morocco, Algeria, \nTunisia) are successful in meeting these targets. Similarly, while the accelerated removal \nof fossil fuel subsidies may be necessary for scaling up the adoption of low-carbon \ntechnologies (International Energy Agency 2010), subsidised tariffs for electricity from \nfossil fuel power plants are essential to regime legitimacy for North African states: this \nmeans their energy choices remain highly political.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nBloomberg New Energy Finance (2010) The sun also rises in the Middle East and North \nAfrica, London: Wind, Solar Research Note, London: Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \n \nInternational Energy Agency (2010) World Energy Outlook 2010, Paris: IEA. \n \nUNEP\/SEFI\/Bloomberg (2010) Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2010 \nhttp:\/\/sefi.unep.org\/fileadmin\/media\/sefi\/docs\/publications\/UNEP_GTR_2010.pdf \n \nUnion of the Arab Maghreb (2008) AMU energy ministers rekindle regional co-operation \nefforts. http:\/\/www.maghrebarabe.org\/en\/print.cfm?news_id=56 \n"}
