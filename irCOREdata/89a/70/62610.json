Many have also\nfound support for invariance in population energy use\nacross taxa within a trophic level (Damuth 1981, 1998;\nEnquist et al. 1998; Ackerman et al. 2004), a phenomenon\nknown as the energy equivalence rule (EER; Nee et al.\n1991). However, we still have a poor understanding of\nhow these relationships emerge given the complexity of\ninteractions among members of ecological communities.\nMany previous theoretical frameworks used to predict\ndensity do not take into account the characteristics of the\nresources, including particle size and availablity (Damuth\n1987; Bohlin et al. 1994; Enquist et al. 1998; Carbone and\nGittleman 2002; Haskell et al. 2002; Jetz et al. 2004). Most\nspecies within communities do not share common re-\nsources: consumers exploit different resources according\nto their ecological function (diet strategy and trophic\nlevel), body size, and phylogeny (Demment and Van Soest\n1985; Vezina 1985; Shine 1991; Illius and Gordon 1992;\nCarbone et al. 1999; Schmid et al. 2000). Thus, in order\nto fully understand patterns in animal abundance, we need\nto understand the scaling of population density not only\nin relation to metabolic rate (resource need) but also in\nrelation to the characteristics of the resources (particle size,\ndistribution, and availability; Schmid et al. 2000).\nHere we develop a simple model of the scaling of animal\nabundance (measured as population density) in relation\nto the scaling of resource needs (metabolic rate) based on\nsimple allometric assumptions about how consumer body\nmass influences resource characteristics. We use this ap-\nproach to predict abundance scaling for carnivorous and\nherbivorous consumers under a range of scenarios. We\nthen discuss how our model predictions compare with\npatterns reported in the literature.\nModel of Animal Density\nWe begin by defining the population based on the geo-\nmetric relationship between the long-term distribution of\n480 The American Naturalist\nconsumers and the distribution, size, and productivity of\nits resources, assuming the space used is sufficient to pro-\nvide the consumer with its energy requirements. We define\nconsumer density Nc, in relation to the consumer resource\nrequirements Qc, and the characteristics of the resource\nand habitat dimensionality (defined below). Food items\nare qualitatively different entities for predators and her-\nbivores, and the densities of items are accordingly defined\ndifferently for these two groups. For predators, we assume\nresources are quantified in terms of the mass of the food\nitem Mi (which is related to consumer body mass), the\nprey item group size Gi (assuming only one individual is\ntaken per group), and item density Ni. For herbivores, we\ndefine a food item as a bite, and the density of items is\ntherefore calculated as the quotient of total available plant\nbiomass Bi and bite size Mi. In addition, the scaling ex-\nponents of density will be affected by the dimensions of\nthe foraging habitat, f (where for terrestrial resourcesfp 2\nand 3 for some arboreal, aerial, or aquatic resources; Car-\nbone et al. 2005). We assume for both predators and her-\nbivores that Nc is also dependent on the long-term pro-\nductivity of resources Ui. Thus,\n2\/f\nM N Ui i iN \u221d , (1a)c ( )Q Gc i\n2\/f\nB Ui iN \u221d , (1b)c ( )Q c\nfor predators and herbivores, respectively.\nGiven these relationships, we use known scaling rules to\nderive a predicted scaling relationship for the characteristics\nof the consumer and its resources. First, food requirements\nof the consumer scale with body mass Mc according to\nqQ \u221d M .

In order to do so, we fit pa-\nrameter values derived from empirical studies in the lit-\nerature to our model and assess whether our emergent\npredictions are consistent with the density\u2013body mass scal-\ning exponents reported for different taxonomic groups of\nconsumers. The scaling exponents of metabolic rate q have\nbeen found to vary with normalization constants (Glazier\n2005), so we use a range of exponents from 0.67 to 1.0\nrepresenting the range of variation described in previous\nstudies (Peters 1983; Clarke and Johnston 1999; Nagy et\nal. 1999; Glazier 2006).\nFor the predator model, we explore the special case where\nis proportional to the prey mass\u2013specific metabolic rateuMi\n(Brown et al. 2000; Charnov 2001; Ernest et al. 2003) and\nthe prey density exponent d equals the negative of the prey\nmetabolic rate exponent. Thus, total population production\nrates across prey types remain constant (i.e., energy equiv-\nalence) and the exponent term in equation (9a)1\u0001 d\u0001 u\nequals zero (Farlow 1976; Damuth 1981; Peters 1983). This\nsimplification allow us to focus our analysis on other factors\nThe Scaling of Abundance in Animals 481\nFigure 1: Predictions of the predator model for the scaling exponent of population density in relation to the scaling of metabolic rate, q (related\nto resource need), in environments of two and three dimensions ( and , respectively), and without or with the scaling of prey groupingfp 2 fp 3\n( and , respectively).

We were\nunable to find studies estimating the scaling of prey group\nsize with body mass except in African bovids, where\n(Brashares et al. 2000). Since some prey typesgp 0.66\nmay not show a grouping effect with mass (e.g., inverte-\nbrate prey), we present predictions with and without this\neffect ( or 0.66), but we expect this exponent maygp 0\nvary within this range.\nFor the herbivore model, the relationship between bio-\nmass scaling exponent b and plant productivity u is com-\nplicated by the fact that herbivores eat only parts of plants,\nso we take a different approach to that used in the predator\nmodel. We expect plant food biomass to scale positively\nwith body mass ( ; Demment and Van Soest 1985).b 1 0\nThere is little published information on the scaling of avail-\nable plant biomass with herbivore mass (taking into account\nselectivity and digestibility). However, two studies estimate\na positive scaling in North American herbivores (Belovsky\n1997) and grazers in Tanzania (Wilmshurst et al. 2000) of\n0.21\u20130.22, so we set . We also have no empiricalbp 0.22\nestimates of the productivity of different plant parts, u, con-\nsumed by herbivores. However, bite mass in herbivores\nscales approximately to the 0.62 of herbivore mass (Shipley\net al. 1994), and if we assume that the production rates of\nthese parts are similar to the production rates of whole\nplants (mass\u00020.25; Enquist et al. 1999), we would predict\nscaling production rates of ( ).up \u00020.16 0.62#\u00020.25\nThe estimated b and u values for the herbivore model do\nnot differ substantially from the equivalent terms in the\npredator model ( , ), and with these1\u0001 dp 0.25 up \u00020.25\nexponent values, the herbivore and predator models (with-\nout prey grouping) make the same predictions.\nResults and Discussion\nOur model is used to make predictions of animal density\nscaling in relation to body mass given variation between\nconsumers in the scaling of resource needs (related to the\nscaling of metabolism), the characteristics of the resource\n(related to consumer size and dietary strategy), and the\ndimensionality of the foraging habitat. Given the observed\nrange of the parameters used in our model, we inevitably\npredict a wide range of density-mass scaling exponents,\nand these predictions are explored in the next sections.\n482 The American Naturalist\nTable 1: Some predictions of the models in relation to the characteristics of prey distribution and dimensions of\nhabitat\nHabitat dimensions\nHerbivore (b p .22;\nu p \u0002.16)\nPredator\u2013no prey groups\n(g or p p 0)\nPredator-prey grouping\n(g p .66, p p 1.0)\nTwo (e.g., terrestrial) \u0002.69 \u0002.75a \u00021.41\nThree (aerial, arboreal, aquatic) \u0002.44 \u0002.50b \u0002.94\nNote: The metabolic rates scaling exponent .qp 0.75\na Predictions consistent with the energy equivalence rule in two dimensions.\nb Predictions consistent with the energy equivalence rule in three dimensions.\nDifferent Routes to the Same Exponent\nUnder a range of different underlying conditions, the model\npredicts similar exponents for the scaling of density. For\nexample, we predict \u00020.67 density scaling for predators\n(without prey grouping) living in a two-dimensional en-\nvironment, with a metabolic rate scaling of 0.67. We predict\nthe same exponent with a metabolic rate scaling of 1.0 with\nno prey grouping in a three-dimensional environment. The\npredator model (in three-dimensional habitats) can also\npredict a density scaling exponent near \u00020.75 across the\nfull range of metabolic rate scaling exponents (0.67\u20131.0),\nwith intermediate values of the prey grouping exponent g\n(varying between 0 and 0.66; fig. 1). The potential for over-\nlap in the model predictions has implications for our un-\nderstanding of energy equivalence, particularly tests of EER\nbased on comparisons of the scaling exponents.\nPrey Characteristics and Habitat Dimensionality\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we presented a special case\nof the predator model in which the exponent terms 1\u0001\nand u canceled out (see eq. [9a]), and there was energyd\nequivalence in prey population energy use and production\nrates (Damuth 1981). Under these conditions, the predator\nmodel predicts energy equivalence without prey grouping\nin two dimensions. Likewise, the herbivore model predicts\nenergy equivalence in two dimensions when b and u cancel\nout. Both models predict shallower density scaling in three-\ndimensional foraging habitats (fig. 1), since density is usually\nmeasured in two dimensions. However, the predictions of\nthe predator model with prey grouping ( ) can deviateg 1 0\nstrongly from energy equivalence (table 1; fig. 1). This is\nbecause an increase in prey group size leads to an increase\nin the distance between kills, thus reducing predator density.\nDeviations from energy equivalence in this model could also\nbe amplified by increasing the prey size scaling exponent p\n(eqq. [9a], [9b]). The simplified conditions for prey energy\nuse illustrate the effects of varying p, g, and f, but the in-\nfluence of the remaining exponents can easily be seen in\nequations (9a), (9b).\nAbundance Scaling in Vertebrates\nConsidering both the habitat dimensions and the scaling\nof resource requirements, we can make broad comparisons\nbetween our predictions and the observed density scaling\nexponents for ecological and taxonomic groups of verte-\nbrates cited in the literature (see fig. 1). The published\nstudies differ greatly in the nature of the data and the\nmethods used for estimating density and census area\n(Blackburn and Gaston 1996), and they are biased in the\nselection of taxonomic groups, so our comparisons should\nbe interpreted with caution.\nIn birds, based on our model predictions, we would\nexpect to see less negative density-mass scaling exponents.\nThis is because of the potentially three-dimensional nature\nof their habitat and because the metabolic rate exponents\nof birds are near 0.67 and significantly lower than 0.75\n(Bennett and Harvey 1987; Nagy 2005). Scrutiny of the\nliterature indicates that the scaling of density relationships\nin birds is highly variable (Gaston and Blackburn 2000;\nRusso et al. 2003) but that the exponents are indeed lower\nthan those found in mammals and other taxonomic\ngroups, with slopes ranging from \u00020.31 to \u00020.60 (Eben-\nman et al. 1995; Russo et al. 2003; \u00020.66 for maximum\ndensity, Brown and Maurer 1987). There is also a tendency\nfor both flightless birds (those living in two-dimensional\nenvironments) and predators like raptors to have more\nnegative scaling exponents (Ebenman et al. 1995; Russo\net al. 2003). Thus, bird abundance scaling is qualitatively\nconsistent with our model predictions.\nAcross a wide range of mammals, most of which are\nterrestrial, population density scales with the inverse of\nthe metabolic rate (scaling exponent of \u00020.78, Damuth\n1981, 1987; Nagy et al. 1999). However, studies on pri-\nmates and other arboreal mammals that have a three-\ndimensional enviroment find less negative density scaling\nexponents between \u00020.54 and \u00020.61 (Robinson and Red-\nford 1986; Fa and Purvis 1997; Carbone et al. 2005). In\naddition, carnivorous mammals have significantly more\nnegative density scaling exponents than herbivores (Mar-\nquet 2002; see also Damuth 1987; Jetz et al. 2004). Both\nof these findings are consistent with our model predictions.\nIn the latter example, we believe that larger carnivores\nThe Scaling of Abundance in Animals 483\ndeviate from the EER because of the greater tendency for\nlarge prey to form groups (i.e., ).g 1 0\nFor lizards, the scaling of density with body mass is\nsignificantly steeper than that of mammals (scaling ex-\nponent of SE; data from Damuth 1987), but\u00021.03\u0002 0.14\nthis is consistent with the observed scaling of metabolic\nrate of 0.92 (significantly higher than 0.75) in this group\n(Nagy 2005). These results are also consistent with our\nmodel predictions for predators with little or no prey\ngrouping ( ) living in a two-dimensional environment.g \u2248 0\nAmong fish, the scaling of density and metabolism are\nwell studied in salmonids. In this group, the scaling is\ngenerally strongly negative, with an average of \u00020.90\n(Grant et al. 1998), and this is consistent with the relatively\nsteep average scaling of metabolism of 0.87 (Steingrimsson\nand Grant 1999). These relationships have been used to\nrepresent support for the EER (Bohlin et al. 1994). Our\nmodel would predict a shallower scaling of density given\nthe three-dimensional nature of aquatic environments, but\nthere may also be an effect of prey grouping on predatory\nfish that counteracts the effect on environment dimension-\nality (fig. 1). In salmonid guilds across sites, scaling expo-\nnents become less negative with increasing water depth\n(Steingrimsson and Grant 1999), which may reflect the fact\nthat in deep water, there is greater potential to use different\nstrata. The scaling of density in reef fish was shallower than\nin salmonids, near\u00020.75, which was justified by Ackerman\net al. (2004) as support for the EER. Without a clearer\nunderstanding of the scaling of fish metabolism, their ecol-\nogy, and other potential conflicting factors, it is hard to\ninterpret whether the observed patterns in density scaling\nsupport our model predictions or the EER.\nConclusions\nOverall, our model predictions highlight the need for a\nbetter understanding of factors affecting the scaling of den-\nsity, such as resource characteristics (e.g., prey choice),\nhabitat dimensions, and metabolic rate scaling. However,\nthere appears to be consistent variation in density scaling\nexponents related to major taxonomic and ecological\ngroups and habitat types, and our predictions are broadly\nconsistent with these observed patterns.\nAbundance is one of the most widely used measures of\nhow animals use their environment and has been studied\nat a range of spatial and temporal scales. While abundance\nis often linked with resource requirements and availability\n(East 1984; Gregory and Gaston 2000; Carbone and Git-\ntleman 2002; Gaston et al. 2003; Etienne and Olff 2004),\nthere has been a lack of a clear theoretical framework to\nunderstand how broadscale interspecific population den-\nsity patterns might emerge from complex communities\ngiven that most species do not share common resources.\nWe believe that the key to understanding how resources\naffect the scaling of animal abundance is to understand\nthe partitioning of resources and, critically, how the size\nand distribution of food items scale with consumer size.\nHaving achieved this, we will be better able to understand\nthe influence of both metabolism and resources on global\npatterns in the scaling of animal abundance. In this article,\nwe have used our model in a very broad context, although\nit could easily be adapted to explore factors affecting spe-\ncific settings on finer spatial scales and as such provides\na general framework for understanding patterns in the\nscaling of animal abundance.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank P.
