This \nis thought to be protective, but is attenuated by both concomitant \nmusculo-skeletal injury and exogenous morphine. The aim of this study \nwas to determine whether the injury-induced attenuation of the response \nto severe haemorrhage could be blocked by naloxone. Male Wistar rats, \nterminally anaesthetised with alphadolone\/alphaxalone (19-20 mg.kg\n-1\n \nI.V.) were randomly allocated to one of four groups; in Groups I and IV \nhaemorrhage was simple (40% of estimated total blood volume (BV)) \nwhile in Groups II and III it was initiated 10 min after the onset of bilateral \nhindlimb ischaemia (a model of musculo-skeletal injury). Groups I and II \nreceived 20 \uf06dL of 0.9% saline intracerebroventricularly (I.C.V.) \nimmediately before haemorrhage, while Groups III and IV received 20 \uf06dg \nof naloxone I.C.V., in the same volume. Group I; the bradycardia reached \nits peak after the loss of 32.8\uf0b10.3% BV (mean\uf0b1S.E.M.). Blood pressure did \nnot fall significantly until the loss of 15.0\uf0b13.0% BV. The response in \nGroup IV was not significantly different from Group I. By contrast the \nbradycardia was absent after similar blood losses in Groups II and III, \nwhile hypotension was attenuated. These results indicate that naloxone, \nat a dose known to be effective in blocking opioid receptors and \npreventing other aspects of the response to injury, does not prevent the \ninjury-induced attenuation of the response to severe haemorrhage. Thus \nthe attenuation of the response to blood loss by injury is unlikely to be \nmediated via the \uf06d opioid receptors. \n  \n - - 3 - -  \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe body\u2019s response to a progressive simple haemorrhage (blood loss in the \nabsence of major tissue damage) is biphasic (Barcroft et al., 1944; Kirkman et \nal., 1994; Ohnishi et al., 1997). During mild haemorrhage there is a reduction \nin pulse pressure which results in unloading of the baroreceptors leading to a \nreflex tachycardia, positive inotropic effect, increase in peripheral resistance \n(Kircheim, 1976), all contributing to the maintenance of mean arterial blood \n(MAP).  \n \nAs the haemorrhage progresses a second phase becomes apparent involving \na bradycardia, a fall in peripheral resistance and a profound fall in blood \npressure (Barcroft et al., 1944). Phase II of the response to simple \nhaemorrhage is not due to a failure of the baroreflex as sensitivity is still high \n(Little et al., 1984) but due to the recruitment of a \u2018depressor\u2019 reflex. The \nbradycardia is mediated by activation of the vagus nerve, as this can be \nblocked with atropine in humans (Lewis, 1932; Barcroft et al., 1944) and \nexperimental animals (Little et al., 1989). Inhibition of the sympathetic efferent \nnerve fibres to the vasculature mediate the fall in total peripheral resistance \n(\u00d6berg & Thor\u00e9n, 1973). The result of these two responses is a profound fall \nin blood pressure. The bradycardia is thought to be a protective mechanism to \nprevent high levels of cardiac work with insufficient coronary perfusion (\u00d6berg \n& Thor\u00e9n, 1972). However, this protective reflex is lost in the presence of \nconcomitant musculo-skeletal injury (Little et al., 1989; Mackway-Jones et al., \n1999); the bradycardia is prevented and the onset of hypotension is delayed \n(Little et al., 1989).  \n \nPhase II of the response to haemorrhage is also attenuated by exogenous \nopioid agents (e.g., morphine) acting on the \u00b5-opioid receptors (Ohnishi et al., \n1997). The endogenous opioids are also known to be responsible for the \ninjury-induced modulation of the vagal limb of the baroreflex (Wyatt et al., \n1995). During injury the sensitivity of the baroreflex is reduced, this effect of \ninjury can be blocked by naloxone and \uf062-funaltrexamine (\uf062-FNA), both \uf06d \nopioid receptor antagonists, indicating that injury must mediate its effect on the \nbaroreflex via activation of endogenous opioid receptors. However, blocking \nthe \uf064 opioid receptors with a \uf064 specific opioid antagonist (e.g. ICI-174 856) \ndoes not inhibit the reduction in baroreflex sensitivity during injury (Wyatt et al., \n1995) indicating further that this effect is mediated by specific activation of the \n\uf06d opioid receptors. \n \nThe aim of this study is to determine whether the effect of injury on the \nresponse to haemorrhage can be prevented by naloxone, injected into the \nlateral cerebral ventricles. \n \n  \n - - 4 - -  \n \n \nMethods \n \nEthical approval  \n \nThe experiments were approved by the local ethics committee of Durham \nUniversity and were conducted in accordance with the Animals (Scientific \nProcedures) Act, 1986.  \n \nThe study was conducted on 20 male Wistar rats of the Harlan Orlac strain \n(body weight 233-260 g), kept on a 12 h light\/dark cycle and fed on Beekay \nstandard rat and mouse diet (B & K Universal Ltd, UK). \n \nImplantation of cerebral ventricular guide cannulae \n \n7-14 days prior to the study 20 rats (210-230 g body weight) were \nanaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone (Sagatal, Rhone Merieux Ltd, UK; \n60 mg.kg\n-1\n intraperitoneal; I.P.). When a surgical level of anaesthesia was \nattained, i.e. the absence of spontaneous movement and corneal and paw \npinch reflexes, the rat was secured in a stereotaxic frame (stereotaxic frame \nmodel 900, Kopf, Succo International Ltd, UK) using atraumatic ear bars.  \n \nAn incision was made along the midline of the scalp to expose the skull. A \nburr-hole was drilled to reveal the dura which was pierced with a needle. In \neach rat a guide cannula (stainless steel 22G, length 11.5 mm) was placed so \nthat its tip lay 1mm above the right lateral cerebral ventricle at the following co-\nordinates: AP -1; L -1.8; DV -2.5 (Pellegrino et al., 1979), where bregma was \ntaken as AP and L zero, while the dura was taken as DV zero. The guide \ncannula was secured in place with two jeweller's screws inserted into the skull \nwith dental cement (Simplex Rapid, Associated Dental Products Ltd, UK), and \nsealed using a stylet. \n \nThe scalp was sutured and the animals treated prophylactically with the \nantibiotic oxytetracycline hydrochloride (Terramycin Q-50, Pfizer Ltd, UK; 30 \nmg.kg\n-1\n I.M.) injected into the left thigh muscle. The animals were allowed to \nrecover from the anaesthetic and housed individually in cages with free access \nto food and water containing chlortetracycline hydrochloride (Aureomycin, \nCyanamid, UK; 0.25% w\/v). \n \nBy the day of the study the body weights of the rats had increased to 233-260 \ng. On the day of the study anaesthesia was induced in all the rats by inhalation \nof isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories Ltd UK; 3.5% in O2\/N2O, FiO2 = 0.5) in an \nanaesthetising chamber (Fluorovac, UK). Once the animal was surgically \nanaesthetised they were transferred to the operating table and the isoflurane \nadministered by mask and co-axial scavenging (Fluovac\nTM\n, International \nMarket Supplies, UK). The percentage of isoflurane was adjusted to 2.5 \u2013 3.5 \n% (0.7 L O2.min\n-1\n) to maintain a surgical level of anaesthesia.  \n \nSurgical preparation \n \n  \n - - 5 - -  \n \n \nIn each rat a cannula (2FG, Portex Ltd, UK) was inserted into the ventral tail \nartery and advanced until its tip lay in the abdominal aorta. Arterial blood \npressure was monitored via this cannula using a strain gauge manometer \n(Sensonor 840, SensoNor a.s., Norway). A lateral tail vein was cannulated \n(2FG, Portex Ltd, UK) for drug administration. All cannulae were initially filled \nwith heparinised saline (5 IU.ml\n-1\n in 0.9% saline) to prevent coagulation of the \nblood in or around the cannula. Body temperature was monitored using a \nrectal thermocouple (Medical precision thermometer; Allab Copenhagen DM \n852). The electrocardiogram was recorded using needle electrodes placed in \nthe skin of the ventrum, and heart period measured from the \nelectrocardiogram. All physiological variables were amplified and recorded \nusing a computerised Data Acquisition System (MacLab 85, ADInstruments, \nUK). Body temperature was maintained at 37.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C (mean \u00b1 S.E.M.) \nthroughout the study using a thermally-insulated operating mat and a heating \nlamp. \n \nExperimental protocol \n \nFollowing the surgical preparation the isoflurane was discontinued and \nanaesthesia maintained with alphadolone\/alphaxalone (Saffan, Pitman-Moore, \nUK, 19-21 mg.kg\n-1\n.h\n-1\n; I.V.) using a pump (Harvard 22, Harvard Apparatus Ltd, \nUK) while the animals breathed air. The anaesthesia was adjusted within the \nrange 19-21 mg.kg\n-1\n.h\n-1\n to maintain an experimental level of anaesthesia (mild \nwithdrawal and a pressor response of approximately 10 mmHg to a noxious \npinch of the foot) with supplemental doses of 0.1 ml alphadolone\/alphaxalone \nI.V. if required. The rats were allowed to stabilise for 60 min, before being \nallocated randomly to one of four groups:  \n\uf0b7 Group I; intracerebroventricular (I.C.V.) saline (20 \u03bcL), sham bilateral hindlimb \nischaemia and haemorrhage \n\uf0b7 Group II; I.C.V. saline (20 \u03bcL), bilateral hindlimb ischaemia and haemorrhage  \n\uf0b7 Group III; I.C.V. naloxone (20 \u03bcg.20 \u03bcL\n-1\n saline), bilateral hindlimb ischaemia \nand haemorrhage \n\uf0b7 Group IV; I.C.V. naloxone (20 \u03bcg.20 \u03bcL\n-1\n saline), sham bilateral hindlimb \nischaemia and haemorrhage.  \nThe lower abdomen of the rats were checked for fullness of the bladder and \nemptied accordingly by applying light pressure to the area. Briefly, baseline \n(pre-injury or pre-sham injury) measurements of heart period and arterial blood \npressure were made. Ten minutes before the onset of haemorrhage, bilateral \nhindlimb ischaemia (an established model of musculo-skeletal tissue injury \n(Redfern et al., 1984)) was induced in groups II and III by application of rubber \nband tourniquets. The tourniquets were kept in place for the remainder of the \nstudy. The animals were allowed to stabilise for 10 min before a control (pre-\nhaemorrhage) recording was made. The rats were then given heparin \n(Monoparin 0.1 ml intra-arterial (I.A.) of 5000 IU.ml\n-1\n, solution providing \napproximately 2000 IU.kg\n-1\n, CP Pharmaceuticals Limited, Wrexham) to \nprevent coagulation and blood samples taken for blood gas analysis. Following \nthis, 20 \uf06dL 0.9% saline (Groups I and II) or 20 \uf06dg naloxone (Sigma Chemical \nCompany, UK) in 20 \uf06dL 0.9% saline (Groups III and IV) was administered into \nthe lateral cerebral ventricles over 20 s via the guide cannula.  \n \n  \n - - 6 - -  \n \n \nDeadspace saline was then aspirated from the arterial cannula. Arterial blood \nwas withdrawn anaerobically from the ventral tail artery in aliquots of 0.5 ml, at \nan overall rate of 2% estimated total blood volume (TBV) per minute until 40% \nof the total blood volume had been withdrawn. Total blood volume was \ncalculated as 6.06 ml.(100 g body weight)\n-1\n (Elebute & Little, 1978; Ohnishi et \nal., 1997). Cardiovascular measurements were made after the withdrawal of \neach aliquot of blood, each blood sample subjected to blood gas analysis \n(ABL5, Radiometer, Denmark), and the cycle repeated until 40% of the total \nestimated blood volume had been withdrawn. Once the haemorrhage was \ncomplete further cardiovascular measurements were made at 100 s intervals \nfor the following 10 min. At the end of the experiment, ink (20 \uf06dL) was injected \nthrough the I.C.V. cannula over 20 s to confirm the correct positioning of the \ncannula into the cerebral ventricles. The animals were then killed with an \noverdose of sodium pentobarbitone (Sagatal, Rhone Merieux Ltd, UK) \nadministered I.V. without regaining consciousness. None of the animals \nreceived fluid resuscitation following the blood loss.  \n \nA post mortem was performed to assess whether any internal damage had \noccurred from the insertion of the I.A. cannula or the thermistor, and to assess \nthe presence of any macroscopic lung pathology and the fullness of the \nbladder. The brain was removed and sectioned to determine the distribution of \nink. Ink was found in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles in all animals.  \n \nCalculations and statistical analysis \n \nMAP was calculated accurately using MacLab software. Data are presented as \nmean \u00b1 S.E.M. Statistical comparisons were made using a 2-way analysis of \nvariance for repeated measures (SPSS\/PC v4.01) unless indicated otherwise, \nand the degrees of freedom adjusted using the Greenhouse-Geisser \ncorrection to minimise the risk of type 1 error (Ludbrook, 1994). Comparisons \nof non-repeated measurements between groups (baseline values, body \nweights) were made using one-way analyses of variance followed, where \nappropriate, by a Tukey post-hoc test (SPSS\/PC v4.01). In all cases P<0.05 \nwas considered statistically significant. \n \n \n \n  \n - - 7 - -  \n \n \nResults \n \nThere were no significant differences between any of the groups in initial \nbaseline values for heart period, MAP, body weight and temperature or arterial \nblood gases (Table 1). \n \nEffects of haemorrhage on saline treated animals \n \nA progressive simple haemorrhage in rats treated with I.C.V. saline, led to an \ninitial fall in heart period of 16\uf0b15 ms (P=0.04, paired t-test) after a loss of \n16.4\uf0b10.2% blood volume (BV), from a pre-haemorrhage level of 147\uf0b16 ms. \nFurther haemorrhage then led to a progressive increase in heart period with a \nmaximum increase of 42\uf0b17 ms after the loss of 32.8\uf0b10.3% BV (P=0.01, paired \nt-test). MAP was initially maintained constant at a level of 102.3\uf0b14.0 mmHg \nuntil the loss of 15.0\uf0b13.0% BV, after which further haemorrhage led to a \nprogressive fall in MBP reaching a minimum value of 20.9\uf0b11.7 mmHg \n(P=0.001) after the loss of 39.8\uf0b10.4% BV (Figure 1, Group I). \n \nArterial oxygen tension remained constant in Group I at 91.4\uf0b12.9 mmHg until a \nloss of 19.7\uf0b10.2% BV after which it increased progressively to a maximum \nvalue of 112.2\uf0b11.6 mmHg after a loss of 39.8\uf0b10.4% BV. Arterial carbon \ndioxide tension fell to 42.0\uf0b12.4 mmHg from a pre-haemorrhagic level of \n44.4\uf0b11.4 mmHg, after the loss of 39.8\uf0b10.4% BV. Arterial pH was maintained \nrelatively constant throughout the haemorrhage with a minimum value of \n7.34\uf0b10.02 after the loss of 40.0\uf0b10.0% BV. Arterial base excess (ABE) initially \nrose to a maximum value of 3.35\uf0b10.48 mM after the loss of 13.1\uf0b10.12% BV. \nThereafter it fell, reaching a minimum value of \u20132.5\uf0b11.2 mM at the end of the \nhaemorrhage. \n \nEffects of injury on the response to haemorrhage in saline treated \nanimals \n \nThe response to haemorrhage in animals subjected to bilateral hindlimb \nischaemia was different to that seen in animals without ischaemia. The \nbradycardia was blunted (P=0.02) and the fall in blood pressure delayed \n(Figure 1, Group II). Thus, rats treated with I.C.V. saline and subject to bilateral \nhindlimb ischaemia preceding the haemorrhage displayed a progressive \nsignificant fall in heart period from a lower initial pre-haemorrhagic level \n(compared to Group I) of 132\uf0b14 ms to 117\uf0b12 ms (P=0.03) after the loss of \n23.5\uf0b10.3% BV. Further haemorrhage then caused an increase in heart period \nreaching a maximum value of 142\uf0b17 ms at the end of the haemorrhage, which \nwas not different from pre-haemorrhage baseline (P=0.15). MAP showed a \nhigher initial value of 121.7\uf0b14.3 mmHg, compared to Group I (P=0.01), which \nwas maintained constant until the loss of 23.5\uf0b10.3% BV where, thereafter, it \nshowed a progressive decrease reaching a minimum value of 27.1\uf0b13.3 mmHg \n(P=0.001) at end haemorrhage (Figure 1, Group II).  \n \n  \n - - 8 - -  \n \n \nArterial oxygen tension remained constant at 99.0\uf0b13.5 mmHg until a loss of \n23.5\uf0b10.3% BV were it slowly and progressively showed a significant increase, \nwith a maximum value of 116.2\uf0b14.2 mmHg (P=0.01) after a loss of 40.0\uf0b10.0% \nBV (i.e. at the end of the haemorrhage). Arterial carbon dioxide tension fell \nfrom a pre-haemorrhagic level of 40.0\uf0b11.4 mmHg, to 37.4\uf0b11.6 mmHg at the \nend of the haemorrhage. Arterial pH was maintained relatively constant \nthroughout the haemorrhage with a minimum value of 7.39\uf0b10.01 after the loss \nof 40.0\uf0b10.0% BV. Arterial base excess was not different from that in Group I. \n \nEffects of haemorrhage in naloxone treated animals \n \nProgressive simple haemorrhage in the absence of injury, in animals treated \nwith I.C.V.  naloxone (Group IV) showed no significant differences in the \nchanges in heart period, blood pressure and arterial blood gases from those \nseen during haemorrhage in animals treated with I.C.V. saline (i.e. Group I; \nFigure 1).  \n \n \nEffects of I.C.V. naloxone on the response to haemorrhage and injury  \n \nThe change in heart period, MAP and arterial blood gases during \nhaemorrhage and injury in naloxone treated rats (Group III) showed no \ndifference from those in Group II treated with saline, haemorrhage and injury \n(Figure 1). Rats treated with I.C.V. naloxone and subjected to bilateral hindlimb \nischaemia, showed no bradycardia and hypotension was delayed until 24% of \nthe total blood volume was lost.  Therefore, with respect to the bradycardic \nresponse to haemorrhage, injury was shown to have a significant effect \n(P<0.001), while naloxone had no significant effect (P=0.190) and there was \nno significant interaction between these two factors (P=0.778), i.e. the effects \nof injury were unaffected by naloxone treatment. \n \n \n  \n - - 9 - -  \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe primary finding of this study is that naloxone, given into the cerebral \nventricles, was did not modify the effects of bilateral hindlimb ischaemia on the \nresponse to haemorrhage. This suggests that the attenuation of the depressor \nresponse to blood loss by hindlimb ischaemia is not mediated by the \uf06d opioid \nreceptors accessible to drugs injected into the lateral cerebral ventricles. This \nis in contrast to the effect of bilateral hindlimb ischaemia on the baroreflex, \nwhich can be blocked by naloxone given I.C.V.  (Wyatt et al., 1995; Little, \n1998). The results in Group I, show the biphasic pattern of cardiovascular \nresponse to a simple haemorrhage; the saline treated animals (Barcroft et al., \n1944; Kirkman et al., 1994; Ohnishi et al., 1997). The pattern of response of \nthe blood gases is also consistent with that found in other studies (Ohnishi et \nal., 1997; Little, 1998) and is thought to be as a result of the stimulation of the \narterial chemoreceptor reflex by the reduction in blood flow through, and a \nsympathetically-mediated vasoconstriction of the carotid and aortic bodies, as \na consequence of a reduced blood volume during the haemorrhage (Acker & \nO'Regan, 1981). Thus, ventilation is stimulated causing the decrease in \ncarbon dioxide tension and the increase in oxygen tension seen. \n \nThe effects of the injury model, bilateral hindlimb ischaemia, on saline treated \nanimals (Group II) during progressive haemorrhage was as expected (Little et \nal., 1989); a blockade of the bradycardia and attenuation of the hypotension \nseen during phase II of the response to a simple haemorrhage. Moreover, \nMAP was maintained until a significantly larger volume of blood had been lost; \nit did not begin to fall until after a loss of 23% blood volume compared to 15% \nblood volume in the haemorrhage and sham injury group. Heart rate and MAP \nwere also higher during haemorrhage on a background of injury than with a \nsimilar volume during a simple haemorrhage. \n \nThe opioid antagonist naloxone, when given into the cerebral ventricles, had \nno effect on the response to haemorrhage or its modification by injury. Animals \nin Group III, treated with naloxone and subjected to bilateral hindlimb \nischaemia, showed no bradycardia and hypotension was delayed until 24% of \nthe total blood volume was lost. This result shows the same pattern of \nresponse as rats treated with saline and subjected to the same injury model \n(Group II). The blood gas results also showed the same pattern of change \nthroughout both experimental protocols. Animals in Groups I and IV, which \nwere subjected to a progressive simple haemorrhage and treated with either \nsaline or naloxone into the cerebral ventricles, showed an identical pattern of \nresponse to haemorrhage. This showed that naloxone itself had no effect on \nthe response to a simple haemorrhage, and thus any change in the response \nto haemorrhage and injury would be certain to be as a result of the effect of \nnaloxone on the response to injury. Thus, the results of this study would \nindicate that naloxone does not block the injury-induced modification of the \nresponse to haemorrhage utilising a pathway accessible via the I.C.V. route, \nunlike its effects on the injury-induced modification of the baroreflex (Wyatt et \nal., 1995; Little, 1998). However, naloxone may have an effect on the injury-\ninduced modification of the response to haemorrhage via pathways elsewhere \nin the brain, not accessible via the cerebral ventricles.  \n  \n - - 10 - -  \n \n \n \nAs I.C.V. administration of naloxone would only reach the periventricular areas \nfuture studies should investigate the effects of high dose intravenous or \nintracarotid naloxone (sufficient to block cerebral \u03bc opioid receptors) on the \ninjury-induced modification of the response to severe haemorrhage. \nAdministration of a high dose of naloxone via these routes would enable the \ndrug to reach more distant sites than adding it into the cerebral ventricles. The \ninterpretation of results from these studies would however be difficult due to a \npossible peripheral site of action, but if the endogenous opioid system really is \nnot involved in the injury-induced modification of the response to a severe \nhaemorrhage, then naloxone would still have no effect.   \n \nIn contrast to this study, high doses of naloxone administered centrally have \nbeen shown to delay the decompensatory phase of the response to \nhaemorrhage in conscious sheep (Frithiof & Rundgren, 2006; Frithiof et al., \n2007)  and rabbits (Evans et al., 1989). However, haemorrhage-induced \nbradycardia is much smaller in these species compared to rat (Ohnishi et al., \n1997) and man (Barcroft et al., 1944; Secher & Bie, 1985). In man during \nlower body negative pressure (LBNP), which reduces venous return (Little, \n1998; van Hoeyweghen et al., 2001), naloxone does not delay the onset of \npresyncope (Smith et al., 1993). Likewise, in anaesthetised rats, centrally \nadministered naloxone failed to attenuate the bradycardia associated with \nsevere blood loss (Little, 1998). However, systemically administered naloxone \nin conscious rats is effective in reversing the decompensatory phase of the \nresponse to haemorrhage via a cerebral mechanism (Faden & Holaday, 1979) \nas well as virtually abolishing it if used as pre-treatment intrathecally (Ang et \nal., 1999). However, the route of administration in this current study was \ndifferent from these last two studies and hence the structures affected are \nlikely to be very different. \n \nNaloxone has a higher binding affinity for the \u03bc-opioid receptor subtype than \nfor the \u03b4-receptors (20-fold) and the \u03ba-receptors (10-fold) (Goldstein & Naidu, \n1989). The high doses of naloxone administered in the aforementioned sheep \nstudies (Frithiof & Rundgren, 2006; Frithiof et al., 2007)  are likely to delay the \ndecompensatory phase of the response to haemorrhage by inhibition of both \n\u03b4-  and \u03ba-opioid receptor subtypes (Frithiof et al., 2007). However, in \nanaesthetised rats I.C.V. administration of  high doses of naloxone, which \nwould antagonise the \u03b4- as well as \u00b5-opioid receptor subtypes, failed to \nattenuate the bradycardia associated with severe blood loss (Little, 1998). \nIndeed at doses high enough to antagonise \u03bc-, \u03b4- and \u03ba-opioid receptors \nnaloxone reduced tolerance to LBNP in healthy humans (Lightfoot et al., \n2000), and similar observations are seen following head-up tilt, (Madsen et al., \n1995), i.e. the decompensated phase was apparent sooner.  \n \n \nIn contrast to the effects of centrally administered naloxone in this study (see \nFigure 1) microinjections of the \u03b4-receptor antagonist naltrindole into a more \nspecific area of the brain; the caudal midline medulla (CMM) delayed the \nhypotension and attenuated the bradycardia associated with severe \nhaemorrhage in anaesthetised rats (Henderson et al., 2002). However I.C.V. \n  \n - - 11 - -  \n \n \nadministration of the \u03b4-receptor agonist DPDPE does not have an effect on \nthe decompensatory phase of severe haemorrhage in the anaesthetised rat \n(Little, 1998). Further studies should now determine whether a \u03b4-opioid \nreceptor agonist, injected into a more specific area of the brain, such as the \nCMM, blocks the injury-induced modification of the response to a severe \nhaemorrhage in the rat. \n \nConclusions  \n \nExogenously administered naloxone given into the cerebral ventricles failed to \nprevent the injury-induced attenuation of the response to a severe progressive \nhaemorrhage in the rat. But this does not mean that the endogenous opioid \nsystem is not involved in this modification, it simply means that the response is \nnot mediated via direct activation of \uf06d opioid receptor subtypes accessible via \nthe cerebral ventricles. The way forward may be to take a closer look at the \ninvolvement of the \u03b4 opioid receptor subtypes in this response. Administration \nof a \u03b4 opioid agonist into a specific area of the brain, perhaps the CMM, may \nprove to block the modification of the response to haemorrhage by injury. A \nbetter understanding of the relationship of the endogenous opioids with GABA \nwithin the central nervous system may shed more light on the mechanisms \nunderlying this response and manipulation of this relationship may prove a \nmeans for restoration of the protective reflex for the heart during the response \nto trauma.  \n  \n - - 12 - -  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAcker H & O'Regan RG (1981).
