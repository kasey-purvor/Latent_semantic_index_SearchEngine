Introduction \n \nThe unique characteristics of lasers furnishes them with the \nability to be employed for the non-contact processing of materials \nwhich are otherwise difficult to process. Concrete is one such \nmaterial since it is a composite, consisting of an array of fine and \ncoarse aggregate pieces embedded within an ordinary Portland \ncement (OPC) matrix. Consequently the processing and surface \ntreatment of concrete can be extremely laborious. This present \nwork describes the utilisation of a high power diode laser \n(HPDL) to produce for the first time an enamelled glaze on the \n\u2018as-cast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete and the effects thereof on the \nOPC\u2019s mechanical, chemical and physical properties. The paper \nreports on the testing of both the untreated OPC surface and the \nlaser generated enamel glaze in terms of bond strength, \ncompressive strength, surface roughness, water sorptivity, wear \nlife characteristics and corrosion resistance. In addition, the \noptimum laser parameters operating window is established, as \nwell as the achievable coverage rates. The value of such an \ninvestigation would be to facilitate the hitherto impossible task of \ngenerating a durable and long-lasting surface seal on the OPC \nsurface of the concrete, thereby extending the life and \napplications base of the concrete. It is a distinct possibility that \nsuch develops may yield significant economic benefits. \nThe laser processing of concrete is a field of ongoing research, \nwith many studies having been carried out to investigate the \ntechnique itself and the associated phenomena. Most of the \nresearch, however, has concentrated on the laser cutting of \nconcrete and reinforced concrete using high power CO2 lasers, \nmost prominently with regard to nuclear reactor decommissioning \n[1-3]. Also, as part of nuclear plant decommissioning, Li et al. [4-\n7] conducted research to determine the workability of several \nlaser techniques for sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto \nconcrete surfaces. Such techniques experimented with were: \ndirect glazing of the concrete, single and multiple layer fusion \ncladding and combined chemical\/fusion cladding. Work by \nSugimoto et al. [8] focused upon modifying the surface \nappearance and surface properties of cement based materials \nusing a high power CO2 laser. The laser treatment produced novel \nsurfaces, with surface textures, properties and appearance unique \nto laser treatment. The resultant physical characteristics and \nmechanical behaviour of the post-process cement based materials \nwas later fully characterised by Wignarajah et al. [9]. Borodina et \nal. [10] has carried out investigations into the structural changes \nwithin the composition of zirconia concrete caused by surface \nexposure to CO2 laser radiation, detailing microstructural \nchanges, phase changes and the absorptivity characteristics. In all \nof these studies, spallation and excessive cracking and porosity \nformation were found to be major problems undermining the \nperformance of the laser treated surface layer. However, \nLawrence and Li [11-14] have treated the OPC surface of \nconcrete with both CO2 and HPDLs. The HPDL generated OPC \nglaze was shown to be more than an effective surface \nmodification insofar as it provided superior mechanical, physical \nand chemical characteristics over an untreated or CO2 laser \ntreated OPC surface. \nTo date very little published work exists pertaining to the use \nof lasers for altering the surface properties of materials in order to \nimprove their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it \nis recognised within the currently published work that laser \nirradiation of a metal surface can bring about changes in the \nmetal\u2019s wettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al. [15, 16] \ncarried out work on the laser coating of aluminium alloys with \nceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on the well \ndocumented fact that generated oxide layers often promote \nmetal\/oxide wetting. Further, Heitz et al. [17], Henari et al. [18] \nand Olfert et al. [19] have found that excimer laser treatment of \nmetals results in improved coating adhesion. The improvements \nin adhesion were attributed to the fact that the excimer laser \ntreatment resulted in a smoother surface and as such enhanced the \naction of wetting. Yet the reasons for these changes with regard \nto changes in the material\u2019s surface morphology, surface \ncomposition and surface energy are not reported. However, in a \nnumber of more comprehensive investigations by Lawrence et al., \nwhich compared the effects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer and HPDL \nradiation on the wettability characteristics of a mild steel [20, 21] \nand a SiO2\/Al2O3-based ceramic material [22], it was found that \nchanges in the wettability characteristics of the steel varied \ndepending upon the laser type. Furthermore Lawrence et al. have \nconducted numerous studies to investigate the feasibility and \ncharacteristics of laser enamelling ceramic materials [23-26] and \nsteels [27, 28]. \n \n2. Experimental Procedures \n \n2.1. Materials \n \nThe concrete studied in the experiments was the ubiquitous \nOPC based concrete. For the purpose of experimental \nconvenience the as-received concrete blocks were sectioned into \nsquares (120 x 120 x 20 mm3) prior to laser treatment. The \ncomposition by volume of the concrete is as follows: 20 mm \nlimestone aggregate (40%), 10 mm limestone aggregate (14%), \nzone M sand (28.5%), OPC (10.5%) and particulate fine \naggregate (7%). In order to obtain results of a practical and useful \nnature, the area of the concrete irradiated during the experiments \nwas the naturally occurring \u2018as cast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete. In \nthis case the OPC surface of the concrete had a thickness of 2.5 \nmm. The composition by volume of the OPC is as follows: CaO \n(63.9%), SiO2 (21.9%), Al2O3 (5.7%), Fe2O3 (2.8%), SO3 (2.7%), \nMgO (2.2%), K2O (0.7%) and Na2O (0.1%).  \nThe enamel used was a commercially available enamel frit \n(Ferro, UK) which, in order to form a manageable paste, was \nmixed with 20wt% white spirit. The composition of the enamel \nconsisted mainly of the following: SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn and \nsmall quantities of Pb, Ba, MgO, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the \npowder size was less than 25 \u00b5m medium size. \n \n2.2. Laser processing procedure \n \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed, \nUK), emitting at 810 nm \u00b120 nm and operating in the CW mode \nwith rated optical powers ranging from 0-120 W. The laser beam \nwas delivered to the work area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m \ncore diameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a \n2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis \nCNC gantry table. The concrete sample blocks and the enamel \nfrit were irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL \nbeam with a beam spot diameter of 2-5 mm and laser powers \n(measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power meter) \nof 20-100 W. The defocused laser beam was fired across the \nsurfaces of the concrete samples by traversing the samples \nbeneath the beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table \nat speeds ranging from 60-600 mm\/min. The laser optics were \nprotected by means of a coaxially blown O2 shield gas jet a rate \nof 5 l\/min.  \nTo determine the characteristics of the HPDL generated glazes \non the treated OPC surface of concrete and the HPDL fired \nenamel, the samples were examined using optical microscopy, \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray \nanalysis (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. \n \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Operating window \n \nFig. 1 schematically illustrates the HPDL OPC surface of \nconcrete glazing and concrete enamelling operating windows in \nterms of traverse speed and power density. Within the optimum \noperating conditions good quality OPC and enamel glazes \ndisplaying few porosities and microcracks could be produced.  \n \n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n0 200 400 600 800\nTraverse Speed (mm\/min)\nP\no\nw\ne\nr\n D\ne\nn\nsi\nty\n (\nW\n\/c\nm\n2\n) \n \nFig. 1. Schematic representation of the operating window for the \nconcrete glazing and enamelling process using the 120 W HPDL. \n \nFurthermore, from Fig. 1 it is possible to ascertain the \nmaximum enamelling rate that it may be possible to achieve using \nthe HPDL. This was calculated as being 0.34 m2\/h for a circular \nbeam of 5 mm diameter with a laser power of 100 W and a \ntraverse speed of 720 mm\/min. \nOPC \nglaze Enamel glaze \n3.2. Morphological and microstructural characteristics \n \n3.2.1. High power diode laser treated OPC surface \n \nThe typical surface morphology of the glaze generated on the \nOPC surface of concrete when using the HPDL is shown in Fig. \n2. As is evident from Fig. 2, crack and porosity formation were \ncommon features of the HPDL glaze. In addition, dramatic \nchanges in the colour of the OPC surface were observed after \nHPDL treatment. Typically the OPC surface changed colour from \ngrey to green. \nThe fracture section of the HPDL glaze generated on the OPC \nsurface of concrete is shown in Fig. 3. As one can see from Fig. \n3, the microstructure of the HPDL generated glaze has no \ndiscernible structure and appears to be fully amorphous. Indeed, \nthese findings were further confirmed by an XRD analysis of the \nHPDL generated glaze which revealed the HPDL induced glaze \nto be fully amorphous [14]. \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Typical optical surface morphology of the HPDL \ngenerated OPC surface glaze. (2.25 kW\/cm2 power density, 240 \nmm\/min traverse speed) \n \n \n \nFig. 3. Typical SEM micrograph of the fracture section of the \nHPDL generated OPC surface glaze. (2.25 kW\/cm2 power \ndensity, 240 mm\/min traverse speed) \n \nPetzold et al. [29] have determined from differential thermal \nanalysis (DTA) results that up to approximately 4200C, OPC \nremains relatively stable. Notwithstanding this, some dehydration \ndoes occur and water is also lost from the pores of the cement. \nThis is, however, far outweighed by the dehydration of Ca(OH)2 \nwhich follows shortly after 4200C is exceeded in accordance with \n \nCa(OH)2 \u2192 CaO+H2O (1) \n \nFurthermore the dehydration of the Ca(OH)2 promotes the \ndevelopment of microcracks which begin initially around the \nCa(OH)2 [30]. Moreover, this dehydration results in unslaked \nlime (CaO), which is effectively the generated HAZ; since the \ntemperature of the surface of the OPC during interaction with \nboth lasers during glazing was measured to be well in excess of \n4200C. This generated CaO HAZ was observed located either \nbelow the glazed surface layer or around the edges of the glazes. \nIndeed, by using a phenolphthalein indicator followed by water \nmisting, it was possible to clearly discern the HAZ around the \nHPDL treated zone on the OPC surface of the concrete, since \nphenolphthalein is an indicator which is colourless in CaO, \nturning violet-red in the presence of Ca(OH)2 due to the change \nin pH. \n \n3.2.2. High power diode laser fired enamel glaze \n \nIt was observed that, prior to laser irradiation, it was not \npossible to fire the enamel onto the OPC surface of concrete. \nIndeed, HPDL interaction with the enamel when placed on the \nuntreated OPC surface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the \nenamel (the formation of small spheres approximately the \ndiameter of the laser beam itself). Such observations are in accord \nwith those of Bourell et al. [31] and Agarwala et al. [32], who \nnoted the balling phenomena during laser sintering work of silica \nbased materials. After HPDL surface treatment of the OPC \nsurface, however, it was possible to fire the enamel directly onto \nthe OPC surface. The mechanism of this phenomena is based \nentirely on the wettability characteristics of the OPC surface.  \n \n \n \nFig. 4. Typical optical surface morphology of the HPDL fired \nenamel glaze on HPDL treated OPC. (1.75 kW\/cm2 power \ndensity, 360 mm\/min traverse speed) \n \n \n \nFig. 5. Typical SEM micrograph of the cross-section of the \nHPDL fired enamel glaze on HPDL treated OPC. (1.75 kW\/cm2 \npower density, 360 mm\/min traverse speed) \n \nThe typical surface morphology of the HPDL fired enamel \nglaze produced on the HPDL treated OPC surface of concrete is \n10\u00b5m \n500\u00b5m \n1 mm \n0.5 mm \nshown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from Fig. 4, neither crack nor \nporosity formation were discernible on the enamel glaze. An \nXRD analysis of the HPDL fired enamel glaze revealed it to be \nfully amorphous.  \nThe typical cross-sectional view of the HPDL fired enamel \nglaze produced on the HPDL treated OPC surface of concrete is \nshown in Fig. 5. As one can see from Fig. 5, the enamel glaze \nappears to be well bonded to the HPDL treated OPC surface of \nconcrete. \nSurface roughness measurements of the surfaces of the \nuntreated OPC, the HPDL treated OPC and the HPDL fired \nenamel glaze were carried out. The investigation revealed that the \naverage surface roughness of the HPDL fired enamel glaze was \n0.21 \u00b5m. This compares with and average of 21.91 \u00b5m for the \nuntreated OPC surface and 2.88 \u00b5m for the HPDL treated OPC \nsurface. Clearly, this considerable improvement in the surface \nroughness of the OPC occasioned by HPDL enamelling makes \nthe surface that much easier to clean and maintain. \n \n3.3. Mechanical, physical and chemical properties \n \n3.3.1. Bond strength \n \nIn order to ascertain the strength of the bond between the \nHPDL fired enamel glaze and the HPDL treated OPC surface, \npull-off tests were conducted. For the tests the concrete was \nprepared as relatively small area samples (25 x 25 mm2). High \ntensile aluminium test dollies were then attached onto the glazed \nsurface and to the axially opposite concrete substrate surface \nusing Araldite epoxy and left to cure for 24 hours. In order to \nensure axial accuracy (essential for true results), the test dollies \nwere set in position using identical V-blocks. The samples were \nplaced into an Instron 4507 tensile\/compressive test rig by \nmounting the test dollies into the jaws of the rig. A tensile force \nwas then applied until failure with the energy being \nsimultaneously recorded. \nA post-test analysis of the samples showed that the material \nfailed below the HPDL treated surface of the OPC in the HAZ. \nWithin the optimum laser operating parameters the average bond \nstrength of the glaze was recorded as 2.4 MPa. This compares \nwith 6.3 MPa for the untreated OPC surface of concrete. \nMoreover, in all of the samples tested, not one failed an the \ninterface between the HPDL fired enamel glaze and the HPDL \ntreated OPC surface It is therefore reasonable to assert that the \nbond strength of the HPDL fired enamel glaze and the HPDL \ntreated OPC surface is somewhat greater that 2.4 MPa. \n \n3.3.2. Rupture strength \n \nTests were conducted to determine the rupture strength of the \nOPC glaze. Test samples were prepared as described above. The \nsamples were placed onto the sample stage of the Instron 4507 \ntensile\/compressive test rig and then subjected to a compressive \nrupture force until the OPC glaze failed (cracked), with the \nenergy being simultaneously recorded. The rupture force was \napplied by means of a high tensile steel indentor with a 1 mm \nradius point. The results of the tests revealed that the average \nrupture strength of the HPDL fire enamel glaze was 2.8 J whilst \nthe rupture strength of the untreated OPC surface was some 4.3 J. \nThe rupture strength of the HPDL treated OPC surface was \nmeasured as being only 0.8 J. \n \n3.3.3. Wear resistance \n \nThe wear resistance of a material in general is determined \nprimarily by the hardness of the material in comparison with the \nhardness of other materials with which it comes into contact [33]. \nHowever, wear resistance does not always increase with hardness \n[34]. Tests were therefore conducted in accordance with \nLawrence et al. [25] to determine the exact difference in wear \nresistance characteristics of the HPDL fired enamel glaze, the \nHPDL treated OPC surface and the untreated OPC surface. For \nexperimental purposes the concrete was cut into smaller pieces \n(25 x 25 mm2). Half of the samples were then laser treated, with \nhalf of the laser treated samples being enamelled. All the samples \nwere then weighed and subjected to a friction force for 8 hours, \nbeing removed from the machine and weighed at intervals of 2 h. \nFig. 6 shows the relationship between weight loss and the \nfriction time for the OPC glaze and the untreated OPC. As one \ncan see, the HPDL treated OPC surface shows a significant \nincrease in wear resistance over the untreated OPC surface, with \nthe weight loss being 2 times lower after 4 hours, and 3 times \nlower after 8 hours. What is more, the HPDL fired enamel glaze \nexhibits not only a much greater wear resistance than the \nuntreated OPC surface, but a marked increase in wear resistance \nover the HPDL treated OPC surface. \n \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n0 2 4 6 8\nFriction Time (h)\nW\ne\nig\nh\nt \nL\no\nss\n (\nm\ng\n\/c\nm\n2\n)\nUntreated OPC surface\nHPDL treated OPC surface\nHPDL fired enamel glaze\n \nFig. 6.

Water sorptivity testing \n \nIn order to test the water sorption properties of the HPDL \nfired enamel glaze, or in other words, the effect of the HPDL \nfired enamel glaze on the water absorption characteristics of the \nconcrete, comparison experiments with both the untreated OPC \nsurface and the HPDL treated OPC surface were conducted by \nmeasuring the water sorptivity. For the experiment the HPDL \ntreated and untreated OPC samples were cut into smaller pieces \n(25 x 25 mm2). The tests were conducted in accordance with the \nstandard procedure as used by Hall et al. [35]. The samples were \ndried to a constant weight in an air oven at 650C to ensure all \npores were free of water. The surfaces of the samples were then \nimmersed in water and weighed at regular intervals. The side \nfaces of the three samples were shielded from the water by means \nof an Araldite coating. In order to determine the sorptivity, i was \nplotted against the square root of time so as to give a straight line, \nas shown in Fig. 7. i is defined as \n \ni\nm\nA\n=\n\u2206 .1000\n (2) \n \nwhere \u2206m is the cumulative change in mass with time and A is the \nabsorbing surface area. The sorptivity, S, of the sample surfaces is \nsimply the gradient of this line.  \nAs is evident from Fig. 7, the sorptivity of the untreated OPC \nsurface was a typical 0.096 mm\/min1\/2, compared with 0.043 \nmm\/min1\/2 for the HPDL treated OPC surface. It is therefore \nreasonable to conclude that since the HPDL treated OPC surface \nhas half the sorption of the untreated OPC surface, then the \nHPDL treated OPC surface afforded the concrete twice as much \nresistance to water absorption than the untreated OPC surface. In \naddition, because the best-fit straight line for the HPDL treated \nOPC surface is below that of the untreated OPC surface, as well \nas intercepting the axis at a point below the untreated OPC \nsurface, then it can be concluded that rate of absorption of the \nlaser surface glazed concrete is much less than that of the \nuntreated concrete. Furthermore, it is a distinct possibility that the \nHAZ, which was identified as CaO resulting from the \ndehydration of the Ca(OH)2, may, once re-hydrated, act as a \nbarrier towards liquids such as water, therefore augmenting the \nresistance of the HPDL treated OPC surface to water absorption. \nMoreover, as Fig. 7 shows, the sorptivity of the HPDL fired \nenamel glaze was practically zero. Thus, it is possible to assert \nthat since the sorption of the HPDL fired enamel glaze is \nnegligible, then the enamel glaze provides the untreated OPC \nsurface of the concrete almost complete resistance to water \nabsorption. \n \n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n0 5 10 15 20\nTime\n1\/2\n (min\n1\/2\n)\ni \n(m\nm\n)\nUntreated OPC surface\nHPDL treated OPC surface\nHPDL fired enamel glaze\n \nFig. 7.

Corrosion resistance \n \nConcrete surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances, \neither as part of the normal service environment and\/or as a result \nof routine cleaning. Therefore corrosion resistance tests based \nupon BS 6431 [36] were conducted using nitric acid, sodium \nhydroxide and Premier Products MP9 detergent cleaner. The \nexperiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the \ncorrosive agents in the concentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, \n20% and 10% on to the surface of the untreated and HPDL \nglazed OPC surface of concrete at hourly intervals for four hours. \nThe samples were then examined optically and mechanically \ntested in terms of compressive strength and wear. High \nconcentrations of the various corrosive agents were used \nprincipally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% nitric \nacid is used within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent \nfor nuclear fuels [37].  \nAll three substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% \nwere seen to immediately attack the untreated OPC surface, with \nthe nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with greater \nseverity than the detergent, whilst the HPDL glazed surface \ndisplayed no discernible microstructural changes or signs of \ndevitrification due to corrosion.  \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [38] revealed \nthat exposure of the untreated OPC surface to the reagents had a \nsignificant effect on the compressive strength and the wear \nresistance of the OPC. Exposure of the OPC to nitric acid and \nsodium hydroxide in the concentrations 40-80% resulted in an \naverage loss of compressive strength of approximately 19-37%. \nIn the case of the detergent a discernible loss in compressive \nstrength only occurred with concentrations above 40%. Here the \naverage loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the \nrange 60-80% was approximately 17%. This compares with no \ndiscernible difference in either the wear resistance or the \ncompressive strength of both the HPDL fired enamel glaze of the \nHPDL treated OPC surface. \nChemical attack also accounted for a large reduction in the \nwear resistance of the untreated OPC surface when exposed to the \nreagents with an 80% concentration. The wear resistance was \nsignificantly affected when the OPC was exposed to nitric acid \nand sodium hydroxide. Here the weight loss was approximately 5 \ntimes higher than for the unexposed OPC after 4 h, and \napproximately 11 times higher after 8 h for the nitric acid. In the \ncase of the detergent the weight loss was marginal after both 4 \nand 8 h. No discernible change in the wear resistance of either the \nHPDL treated OPC surface of the HPDL fired enamel was \nobserved. \n \n \n4. Discussion \n \n4.1. OPC glaze formation mechanism \n \nThe complex chemistry of the OPC surface of concrete and the \nhydration of its various constituents are a complex issue. \nNonetheless, it is known that the constituents of OPC are \nminerals which exist as multi-component solid solution chemical \ncompounds. Of particular importance with regards this study, \nOPC contains in relatively large proportions: SiO2 (21wt%), \nAl2O3 (5wt%) and Fe2O3 (3wt%), which are basic glass network \nformers and modifiers. Consequently the intense local heating \nbrought about by the incident HPDL beam results in melting of \nthese compounds at around 12830C [4], thereby causing the \nmaterials to lose the retained water and form an amorphous \nglassy material consisting of various calcium-silicate-alumina \ncompounds [4]. Indeed, the amorphous nature of this glaze was \nverified by XRD analysis results given elsewhere [14]. \nAs was mentioned earlier, HPDL interaction with the OPC \nsurface occasioned a dramatic colour change; changing from grey \nto green. These changes are due to the resultant phase transitions \nand also, the presence in small concentrations of metal transition \nions in various oxidation states within the OPC composition, in \nparticular, ferric ions in the Fe3+ and Fe2+ oxidation state. Fe3+ \nand Fe2+ ions are known to give rise to green and blue colours \nrespectively when subjected to intense heating [39, 40]. \nHowever, if both phases are present within the composition, then \nthe colour is determined by the Fe3+\/Fe2+ ion ratio, resulting in \ndark blue or black colours [39, 40]. Since the surface produced \nafter HPDL treatment was green, then it is reasonable to assume \nthat both phases were not present within the OPC. \n \n4.2. Crack prevention in the enamel glaze \n \nAs one can see from Fig. 4, cracking of the HPDL fired \nenamel glaze did not appear to occur. The absence of microcracks \ncan be attributed mainly to tolerable thermal stresses generated \nduring HPDL irradiation. In general, during the heating phase the \nstresses will be compressive and relieved by plastic deformation, \nthus precluding crack formation. At high temperatures (T\u2265Tm) the \nstresses can also be relieved [41-43]. However, during cooling \nwhen the temperature falls below Tm, stresses will then \naccumulate. If the fracture strength of the material is exceeded, \nthen cracking within the melted layer will occur. The thermal \nstress \u03c3, induced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using \nthe Kingery equation:  \n \n\u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (3) \n \nwhere E is Young\u2019s modulus, \u2206T is the temperature change, \u03b1 is \nthe coefficient of thermal expansion and \u03bd is Poisson\u2019s ratio. \nMore succinctly, \u2206T is the difference between the critical \ntemperature (below which stresses can no longer be relieved) and \nambient temperature. For the HPDL fired enamel glaze this is the \ndifference between the melting point, 5100C and ambient \ntemperature 200C. So, by using the following values for the \nenamel glaze [26]: E=6.25 x 104 MN\/m2, \u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1, \n\u2206T=4900C and \u03bd=0.162, when the OPC surface of the concrete \nwas irradiated by the HPDL beam the thermal stress produced in \nthe resulting glass according to Eq. (3) was around 120 MN\/m. \nSince this is below the fracture strength of the enamel glaze, 135 \nMN\/m2 [26], cracking will not occur. \n \n4.3. Stability of the enamel glaze to devitrification \n \nDespite the fact that HPDL interaction with the enamel \ngenerated a fully amorphous glaze, it is possible for the enamel \nglaze to become crystalline through the destruction of the glassy \nstate by means of a process known as devitrification. This can \noccur as either the breakdown of the glass surface by corrosion or \nweathering, or as a result of the overall composition remaining \nunchanged while the crystals separate in the glassy medium, \ntherefore destroying the glassy state. This process being entirely \ndependant upon the temperature and composition of the glass. A \nfurther XRD analysis and a high magnification SEM examination \nof the enamel glaze produced no evidence of devitrification was \nobserved within the OPC glaze. \nAs the findings of the corrosion testing work revealed, the \nHPDL fired enamel glaze displayed complete resistance to all \nthree reactive agents, even at the highest concentrations. But, \nperhaps more importantly, even when exposed to the highest \nconcentrations, no discernible microstructural changes or signs of \ndevitrification due to corrosion were seen in either glaze. This is \narguably a strong indication that the HPDL fired enamel glaze \npossesses an amorphous structure that provides more than \nadequate resistance to ageing and chemical attack. Furthermore, it \ncan be asserted that the glass also did not devitrify as a result of \nfavourable high temperatures and glass composition. This is of \ngreat significance since devitrification in this manner is the result \nof the movement of atoms to allow orientation and the presence \nof crystallisation centres. Such centres occur usually at the \nglass\/air boundary, around a porosity [44]. Clearly, as Fig. 4 \nshows, porosities were in general not a common feature of the \nHPDL fired enamel glaze. Additionally, it is highly likely that the \ncomposition of the enamel glaze itself also played an important \npart in the stability to devitrification of the glaze. In particular it \nis known that compounds such as Al2O3 and MgO (which are \npresent in abundance in the enamel glaze) are known to be very \nuseful in assuaging devitrification problems [44]. This is because \nthe inclusion of such compounds within the enamel glaze \ncomposition creates an glaze without a high liquidus temperature \nand therefore a reduced tendency towards devitrification [44]. \n \n4.4. Wettability characteristics. \n \nThe fact that it was not possible to HPDL fire the enamel \nglaze onto the OPC surface without prior HPDL treatment is due \nentirely to the wettability characteristics of the untreated and \nHPDL treated OPC surface. A full analysis of this phenomena is \ngiven elsewhere [45, 46]. For this study it suffice to say that \nHPDL treatment of the OPC surface effected changes in the \nwettability characteristics of the OPC by melting and vitrifying \nthe surface so that a more dense surface which was more polar in \nnature and that possessed an increased O2 content; factors that are \nknown to improve the wettability characteristics of materials such \nas the OPC [22, 24, 26]. \n \n4.5. Bonding characteristics \n \nBased on the nature of the attractive forces existing across         \na liquid-solid interface, wetting can be classified into the two \nbroad categories of physical wetting and chemical wetting. In \nphysical wetting the attractive energy required to wet a surface is \nprovided by the reversible physical forces (van der Waals). In \nchemical wetting adhesion is achieved as a result of reactions \noccurring between the mating surfaces, giving rise to chemical \nbonds [47].  \nIn practice, however, complex combinations of various \nbonding mechanisms actually occur, varying according to the \ntypes of materials used [47]. For the HPDL treated OPC surface \nand the enamel, the mechanisms involved in the bonding            \nare principally: physical bonding (van der Waals forces), \nmechanical bonding, chemical bonding (oxide transformation     \nand O2 bridging) and on a very small scale, electrochemical \nreactions such as the electrolytic (redox) effect due to the \npresence of ferric oxides within the HPDL treated OPC reacting \nwith other oxides in the enamel [47]. Invariably, the preponderant \nbonding mechanisms between ceramic materials and enamels       \nare physical and mechanical bonding [48]. Yet an EDX analysis \nconducted at the interface between the mild steel and the       \nenamel revealed the presence of a small diffusion region         \nwhich contained elements unique to both the HPDL treated        \nOPC and the enamel. This is perhaps to be expected since     \nenamel glazes on most materials are typically bonded as a     \nresult of some of the base material dissolving into the glaze [47], \nwith wetting characteristics often being achieved or enhanced       \nby a reaction at the interface at an elevated temperature         \n(redox reaction) [49]. \nTable 1 \nWear rate details and the nominal life increase of the HPDL fired enamel glaze over untreated OPC in various corrosive environments. \n   Wear Rate (mg\/cm2\/h1) \n Density Thickness Unexposed Detergent NaOH HNO3 \nUntreated OPC 2220 kg\/m3 1500 \u00b5m 9.8 18.5 73.8 114.8 \nHPDL fired enamel glaze 2650 kg\/m3 750 \u00b5m 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 \nIncrease in Wear Life  ~ ~ 4.5 8.5 33.9 52.7 \n \n4.6. Wear life characteristics \n \nAs the results of the mechanical and chemical tests show, the \nHPDL fired enamel glaze out performed the untreated OPC \nsurface in almost all the test areas. Moreover, the generally \nsuperior mechanical and chemical performance of the HPDL \nfired enamel glaze over the untreated OPC suggests that the life \ncharacteristics of the HPDL fired enamel glaze may also superior \nto those of untreated OPC. This was especially true in the case of \nchemical resistance and water absorptivity, where the HPDL fired \nenamel glaze proved to be resistant to both.  \nThis marked variation in corrosion resistance and absorptivity \nperformance is due to the difference in structure of the HPDL \nfired enamel glaze and the untreated OPC. Whereas the HPDL \nfired enamel glaze is of an amorphous nature, the untreated OPC \nis comprised of a porous polycrystalline structure, thus the \nuntreated OPC is readily attacked by acids whilst the amorphous \nstructure of the HPDL fired enamel glaze ensures an increase in \nacid resistance [48]. Yet in any analysis of the wear life of the \ntwo materials the in-situ relative thickness of the HPDL fired \nenamel glaze and the untreated OPC layer on concrete must be \nconsidered in order to give a true interpretation of the actual life \ncharacteristics, particularly when considering the wear resistance \n(with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). \nConsequently the increase in wear life can be given by \n \nIncrease in wear life =  \nHPDL fired enamel glaze wear life\nUntreated OPC wear life\n  (4) \nwhere, \n  \nWear life =  \nDensity .  Thickness (mg.cm .cm)\nWear rate (mg.cm .h )\n-3\n-2 -1\n  (4a) \n \nTable 1 summarises the wear rate details and the nominal       \nlife increase of the HPDL fired enamel glaze over the untreated \nOPC surface in a variety of environments. To simulate service     \nin a number of environments the untreated, laser treated             \nand enamelled OPC surfaces were exposed prior to wear        \ntesting to a detergent, NaOH and HNO3. As Table 1 shows,         \nthe HPDL fired enamel glaze gives an increase in actual life         \nover the untreated OPC surface regardless of the environment. \nHowever, as one can see, the increase in actual life of the        \nHPDL fired enamel glaze over the untreated OPC surface        \nvaries considerably depending upon the working environment. \nBut, notwithstanding this, arguably the most common          \nworking environment for an OPC surface would involve           \nsome contact with at least detergent acids, therefore            \nyielding significant economic savings since a HPDL fired     \nenamel glaze surface lasts around 4-times longer than one        \nwhich is unglazed. \n5. Conclusions \n \nUsing a 120 W high power diode laser (HPDL), the firing of a \nvitreous enamel frit to produce an enamel glaze on the ordinary \nPortland cement (OPC) surface of concrete was successfully \ndemonstrated with power densities as low as 1 kW\/cm2 and at \nrates up to 780 mm\/min. The glazes produced were typically 750 \n\u00b5m in thickness and displayed no discernible microcracks or \nporosities. A maximum coverage rate of 0.34 m2\/h was \ncalculated. \nOwing to the wettability characteristics of the untreated OPC \nsurface, it proved necessary to expose the surface of the OPC to \nHPDL radiation in order to fire the enamel. It is believed that this \nprior laser treatment effected changes in the wettability \ncharacteristics of the OPC by melting and vitrifying the surface \nso that a more dense surface which was more polar in nature and \nthat possessed an increased O2 content; factors that are known to \nimprove the wettability characteristics of materials such as the \nOPC. \nMechanical testing of the HPDL fired enamel glazes revealed \nthat the average rupture strength of the HPDL fired enamel glaze \nwas 2.8 J, whilst the rupture strength of the untreated OPC \nsurface was some 4.3 J. The average bond strength of the glaze \nwas recorded as 2.4 MPa. This compares with 6.3 MPa for the \nuntreated surface of the OPC. The HPDL fired enamel glaze \nexhibited exceptional resistance to chemical attack and water \nabsorption, whilst the untreated OPC surface was highly \nsusceptible to both.  \nLife assessment testing revealed that the HPDL fired enamel \nglaze effected an increase in wear life of 4.5 to 52.7 times over an \nuntreated OPC surface, depending on the corrosive environment. \nClearly, the economic and material benefits to be gained from the \ndeployment of such an effective and efficient coating on OPC \ncould be significant. \n \n \nReferences \n \n1.
