INTRODUCTION 1 \n \nThe Group of Eight (G-8) countries has emphasised that \u2018IT empowers, benefits and \nlinks people the world over \u2026 access to the digital opportunities must, therefore, be \nopen to all\u2019 (G-8 Countries, 2000). The expectation is that the extension of global \ntelecommunication networks and the use of the Internet can provide a new means for \ndeveloping countries to benefit from their participation in the global economy.  \nDeployment of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) is \nexpected to provide a major stimulus for economic growth.  Despite the very \nsubstantial gaps in the availability of the new technologies, firms in developing \ncountries that do gain access are expected to benefit substantially.  \n \nThe spread of global networks enables firms to implement electronic commerce as a \nmeans of facilitating their entry into international markets. Electronic commerce, \nespecially using the Internet, is expected to enable firms to reduce the costs of setting \nup and completing transactions, a gain in their economic efficiency.  Even the smallest \nfirms are expected to benefit (Xie, 2000).  Some observers argue that business-to-\nbusiness \u2013  B2B \u2013 electronic commerce will strengthen the bargaining power of \nproducer firms in developing countries so that they can reposition themselves within \nglobal value chains (Gereffi, 2000). Panagariya (2000: 5) even suggests that \u2018given the \ncost savings offered by Internet technology and relative ease with which it can be \nprovided, they [i.e. developing countries] can now skip several stages of technological \ndevelopment through which developed countries had to go.  Stated differently, \ndeveloping countries are much farther inside the current technological frontier and, \ntherefore, have larger potential benefits from moving to it\u2019.   \n \nThe claims about the impact of the transfer of advanced ICTs to developing countries \nare examined in this paper by considering the specific case of the impact of electronic \ncommerce.  Is there clear evidence that the deployment of these technologies is \nproviding a strong basis for macro-economic growth? Is the transfer of these \ntechnologies offering new opportunities for producer firms in developing countries?  \nIt is very difficult to provide unambiguous answers to such questions.  Evidence in \nsupport of significant gains for developing countries at the macro-economic level is \npractically non-existent.  At the micro-economic level, there are signs that some firms \nbenefit from their access to advanced ICTs.  \n \nIf the optimistic expectations about the impact of advanced ICTs on economic growth \nand development are to be met, the technological gaps between industrialised and \n                                                 \n1\n  The author has benefited substantially from comments provided by Andrew Glyn, Andrew \nGraham, and participants at a workshop where contributing authors to this issue of the Journal \nreviewed an earlier draft, and from discussions with W. E. Steinmueller. Any errors or \nomissions are the author\u2019s responsibility.   \n 2 \ndeveloping countries (and between firms within developing countries), that is, the \n\u2018digital divides\u2019, need to be reduced.  This will require a rapid process of \ntechnological catch-up. At this early stage in the diffusion of advanced ICTs, the \nevidence shows that the \u2018e-readiness\u2019 of countries varies substantially. The capacity to \ngain from the availability of advanced ICTs involves far more than a reduction of the \ntechnological divide.  Institutional arrangements that support commercial activity and \ninternational trade also need to be put in place if firms are to reap the potential \nbenefits of the new \u2018digital opportunities\u2019.  The absence of these arrangements in \nmany countries represents a major missing link in the capacity to generate sustained \neconomic advantage from the use of advanced ICTs. \n \nSection II examines the evidence in support of claims about the potential gains from \nthe transfer of digital technologies to developing countries.  Section III considers the \nextent of the so-called \u2018digital divide\u2019 and its relationship to the position of countries \nwith respect to per capita income and educational attainment indicators.  In section IV \nthe opportunities created by the development of electronic commerce for firms in \ndeveloping countries are examined, particularly with respect to whether the Internet \noffers a new means for firms to enter global markets on terms that are more \nfavourable than in the past. Section V illustrates the institutional conditions that must \nbe in place if the new global electronic trading environment is to be open to many \nfirms in developing countries.  The final section draws some conclusions about the \nlikely prospects for successful ICT-based technological leapfrogging strategies.  \n \n \nII. POTENTIAL GAINS FROM THE TRANSFER OF DIGITAL \nTECHNOLOGIES \n \nInternet-based electronic commerce is regarded as an extremely positive development \nfor developing countries. The United Nations (2000) High Level Panel on Information \nand Communication Technologies concluded, for instance, that when firms in \ndeveloping countries become connected to global networks, they should be able to \ncompete on a more equitable basis in world markets.  In the absence of any conclusive \nempirical evidence, this view rests mainly upon theoretical arguments about the \neconomic outcomes that may be associated with the transfer of advanced ICTs.   \n \nFirst, it is expected that the spread of advanced ICTs and their use to support \napplications like electronic commerce will lead to significant productivity \nimprovements.  These improvements are necessary if developing countries are to \nachieve long term economic growth.  Since capital and labour inputs grow relatively \nslowly, significant improvements in output growth require being able to accomplish \nmore with the same (or only slightly more) inputs.  Industrialised countries face the \ndifficult problem of raising already high levels of productivity, but developing \ncountries are expected to have the advantage that they can progress towards the \nfrontier over ground that has already been covered. All of the components of global \nnetworks and software applications are available on the international market and they \nare easily transportable.  This characteristic appears to imply that advanced ICTs have \nthe potential to support \u2018technological leapfrogging\u2019 (Soete 1985).  This is expected to \nenable developing countries to reduce gaps in productivity and output between \nthemselves and the industrialised countries. \n 3 \n \nUnfortunately, this outcome is more difficult to achieve than it first appears \n(Steinmueller 2001).  If \u2018technological leapfrogging\u2019 is to be successful, it must be \nfeasible to bypass stages of capability building or investment that the industrialised \ncountries have had to pass through in the process of economic development.  This \ntheory implies a linear and highly predictable set of stages of development (Rostow \n1962).  This view has been largely rejected at the macro-economic level, but there is \nstill an expectation that firms can develop successful leapfrogging strategies through \ntheir use of advanced ICTs.  In order to do so, however, the absorptive capacity of \nfirms must be strengthened.  This generally involves an extended period of learning \nand adaptation of the new technology (Cohen and Levinthal 1991).  When access to \nthe technology remains prohibitively expensive, a large number of complementary \ntechnologies and capabilities are required for successful implementation, and the costs \nof acquiring and maintaining relationships with other participants in global supply \nchains are unfavourable, firms may not benefit in the manner that theory predicts.  \n \nCompared to other technological innovations, advanced ICTs are exceptional in \nseveral respects.  Their diffusion is accompanied by substantial amounts of instruction \nmaterials that may be used to speed up and augment the learning process \n(Steinmueller 2001).  The investment required to achieve global connectivity, while \nconsiderable for many firms in developing countries, is relatively modest as compared \nto other technologies.  These technologies also are malleable in that certain \ncomponents such as software can be altered and adapted for experimentation in new \nsettings.  These features suggest that advanced ICTs may offer a basis for achieving \nmajor transformations in the way firms in developing countries conduct their business \nand engage in international trade.  \n \nSecond, assuming that developing countries are able to access and use digital \ntechnologies effectively to compete in international markets, their inclusion within the \ninternational trading environment may yield a factor price equalisation effect (Wood \n1995).  Economists argue that the long run equilibrium arising from international trade \nwill result in equalising the wage rates between industrialised (high wage) and \ndeveloping (low wage) countries.  As trade displaces low wage activities in the \nindustrialised countries and increases employment in the developing countries, the \nwages in the developing countries will be bid up because of a strong demand for their \nservices.  Wages in industrialised countries need not fall if it is possible to move \ntowards capital-intensive production as a consequence of gains from trade.   \n \nIndustrialised country workers may become more intensively involved in capital \nintensive work (tool making) and developing country may workers become more \nintensively involved in using output or \u2018tools\u2019 to provide output for the industrialised \ncountries (this scenario is premised on the assumption that tool making is a capital \nintensive activity).  If the prices of the tools made in industrialised countries fall, i.e. if \nthe prices of digital equipment fall, this may further increase the demand in \ndeveloping countries for the digital tools, potentially accelerating the rate of wage \nequalisation.  However, to achieve these effects, the tools must provide gains over \ncurrent technique.  In developing countries it is possible to use labour-intensive \nmethods rather than digital tools and it is possible that the use of digital tools will not \nprovide sufficient gain to create an incentive for their adoption (i.e. to support a higher \n 4 \nlevel and elasticity of demand). The elasticity of demand for advanced ICTs is \ntherefore an important issue.  The strength of factor price equalisation effects is a \nmatter for empirical verification, but the implications for the economic prospects of \ndeveloping countries are potentially substantial.  \n \nIII. LEAPFROGGING AND CATCHING UP \n \nThe evidence in support of a strong relationship between investment in advanced ICTs \nby developing countries and economic growth, at least at the macro-economic level, \nhas been found to be very weak (KPMG 2000).  This is partly attributable to the fact \nthat it is difficult to establish an empirical link between the diffusion of digital ICTs \nand economic development on the basis of available data. It may also be due to the \nfact that the positive effects of the global extension and consolidation of digital \nnetworks may take time to accumulate (Rodriguez and Wilson III, 2000).   \n \nEvidence of a statistical association between investment in advanced ICTs and \nproductivity improvements also has been elusive in the industrialised countries until \nvery recently, even at the firm level (Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000).  In fact, the United \nStates is the only country where such an association has been clearly documented.  \nThis has required the application of constant quality price indexes to national income \nand product account data.  With the relevant adjustments, Jorgenson (2001: 1) has \nshown that: \u2018the relentless decline in the prices of information technology equipment \nhas steadily enhanced the role of IT investment as a source of American economic \ngrowth.  Productivity growth in IT-producing industries has gradually risen in \nimportance and a productivity revival is now underway in the rest of the economy.  \nDespite differences in methodology and data sources, a consensus is building that the \nremarkable behaviour of IT prices provides the key to the surge in economic growth\u2019 \n \nAnalysis focusing narrowly on investment in the telecommunication infrastructure and \neconomic advantage is also beginning to show some benefits for developing countries.  \nFor example, Reynolds et al. (2001) examined the importance of investment in \ntelecommunications in decisions about the location of foreign direct investment. They \nfound that when countries have one more telephone per 100 people than the average \nnumber of telephones expected at their given income level, they receive 0.3 cents per \nUSD 100 of GDP more foreign investment than countries with an average number of \ntelephones.  \n \nThe firm-level data on the impact of advanced ICTs is not systematic enough to \nprovide a basis for drawing robust conclusions about the economic impact of \ninvestment.  Nevertheless, strategies aimed at transferring digital technologies to \ndeveloping countries are yielding positive results in some countries.  For instance, \nIndia is often taken as a country that has succeeded in enhancing its capacity to benefit \nfrom digital technologies based on heavy investment in a workforce with specialist \nskills in software development.  India\u2019s total information technology and software \nservice revenues from exports reached USD 5.7 bn in 1999-2000 (Achar, 2000). \nAlthough India has a strategy to take advantage of the opportunities created by \nadvanced ICTs, success in developing the export market for software may be \naccompanied by the growth of sophisticated digital enclaves that are surrounded by \npoverty.  Singhal and Rogers (2001) have observed that \u2018while the new \n 5 \ncommunication technologies \u2026 are impacting Indian society in dramatic ways, the \nsubcontinent is still mainly a developing nation in which many citizens depend on the \nbullock cart [footnote omitted] for transportation and on human labor for making a \ndaily living\u2019 (Singhal and Rogers, 2001: 19).  Heeks (1996) also suggests that India is \npromoting an enclave development process around highly skilled, low paid workers \nwith few spin-offs to the rest of the economy.  \n \nThere are numerous examples of cases where there appear to be benefits to firms as a \nresult of the use of advanced ICTs to achieve improved access to international \nmarkets.  For instance, an Internet connection in a Peruvian village has helped the \ncommunity to establish a partnership with a company in New York and to expand the \nmarket for its agricultural products.2 Many Internet-based companies are supporting \ninternational trade and some claim to provide services for producers in developing \ncountries.  Unfortunately, there are few systematic studies of whether producers in \ndeveloping countries are benefiting from the services (Maitland 2001).  Barriers \ninclude the costs of network access, the firms\u2019 existing business practices, and the \nabsence of the necessary legislative arrangements to allow firms to trade online.   \n \nOne example of the new Internet intermediary firms is FoodTrader.com, a B2B e-\nmarketplace for the agriculture industry which offers updated market prices, country \nprofiles, logistics services, and related information.  Members can buy, sell and bid for \nproducts on-line but there is no publicly available data on the geographical \ndistribution of users.  Another is ClickTex.com, a service that allows companies to \nsource, sample, sell and track textiles globally, but participation in this marketplace is \nrestricted to sellers and buyers that have been pre-qualified for quality, integrity, \ncapabilities and credit-worthiness.  \n \nEven where the ICT infrastructure is in place, there may be large differences in the \nlevels of awareness of firms about the potential benefits.  Moodley (2000: 49) found, \nfor instance in South Africa, that only a very small proportion of the members of an \nautomobile manufacturers\u2019 club [17 respondents] had plans to integrate Internet use \ninto their supply chains even though all had access to the Internet. Nevertheless, there \nis evidence that familiarity with ICTs is important for ensuring their effective use \n(Mansell and Steinmueller, 2000; Mansell and Wehn, 1998). \n \nIn these and the many other examples that could be provided, experience indicates that \nthere are major challenges for policy makers who are seeking to reap the potential \nbenefits of an ICT-based leapfrogging strategy. The evidence from the micro or firm \nlevel evidence is that the effects of investment in advanced ICTs in developing \ncountries are enormously variable from one country to another.  There also can be \nsubstantial variations within countries.  Policy makers need to create mechanisms to \nensure that the benefits of the digital enclaves in India, Malaysia and some other \ndeveloping countries begin to spread beyond the enclave boundaries.  This requires \nwidespread and affordable access to advanced ICTs and an appropriately trained \nworkforce.  It also requires institutions that encourage the accumulation of capabilities \nfor trading in international markets. The next section examines the barriers to \ninternational trade associated with the technological or digital divide.   \n                                                 \n2\n  See http:\/\/www.undp.org\/info21\/e-com\/e1.html, last accessed 22 June 2001. \n 6 \n \n \n \n \nIV BARRIERS TO TRADE CREATED BY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE \n \nDeveloping countries have a much smaller capacity overall to take advantage of the \nopportunities offered by advanced ICTs.  Whether this smaller capacity has \nconsequences for these countries\u2019 development as ICTs are used more intensively and \nextensively in the global economy is an important issue for policy. Some of the \nstandard indicators of the digital divide are shown in Table 1.  \n \n------- \nInsert Table 1 about here \n------- \n \nTable 1 shows that the overall imbalances in access to the fixed and mobile \ntelecommunication infrastructure, personal computers, the Internet and television \nreceivers are substantial. The ratio of Internet users to the overall population in Africa \nis estimated to be 1:750 as compared to a world average of 1:30.  The former ratio \nhides disparities within countries where Internet access is confined largely to major \ncities and is virtually unavailable to the 60 per cent of the population living in rural \nareas (Souter and Girardet, 2000). \n \nDistinctions between countries in their relative intensity of use of ICTs arise from \nhistorical circumstances. Figure 1 illustrates the pattern of ICT related developments \nfor three developing countries (in terms of per capita income).  The \u2018reference\u2019 \nindicators are per capita income and combined enrolment in primary, secondary and \ntertiary education.  These are reported as a percentage of the world average values.  \nThe indicators of ICT development are fixed mainlines (ML), television receivers \n(TV), Internet hosts (IHC), personal computers (PC), and mobile telephone lines \n(MOB).  These are based on per capita measures and are displayed in relation to the \nrespective world average.   \n \nIn Figure 1, the world average appears just inside the outer perimeter of the graph.  \nThe figure compares China, with a per capita income of one half of the world average, \nwith two countries with even lower levels of per capita income, Pakistan and Ethiopia.  \nAll these countries are making major investments in education.  Despite having a per \ncapita income of less than one half the world average, China has boosted education \nenrolment above the world average.  Pakistan and Ethiopia\u2019s achievements are also \nstriking in relation to their modest per capita incomes. Pakistan has achieved an \nenrolment of 70 per cent of the world average with only 25 per cent of the world \naverage per capita income.  Ethiopia has achieved 40 per cent of the world average \nenrolment although its per capita income is only 10 per cent of the world average. \n \nChina has achieved the most impressive results on the ICT indicators, exceeding the \nworld average in television receivers per capita and achieving 60 per cent of the world \naverage in fixed mainlines (although China per capita income is only 50 per cent of \nthe world average).  In PCs, China has achieved 20 per cent of the world average of \n 7 \nPCs per capita.  Pakistan\u2019s achievement of 40 per cent of the world average of \ntelevision receivers is notable in the light of its per capita income of 25 per cent of the \nworld average.  On all of the other measures, however, these countries lag far behind \nthe world average.  In Internet hosts, for example, China has 2 per cent of the world \naverage, with even smaller numbers in Pakistan (0.29%) and Ethiopia (0.01%).  \nPakistan and Ethiopia have 6 per cent and 2 per cent of the world average in PCs per \ncapita, respectively, and 2 per cent and 0.13 per cent of the world average in mobile \ntelephones.   \n \nThese countries are all poorer than the world average in terms of per capita income, \nand their capacity to develop the use of ICTs is even more constrained.  Except for \nChina\u2019s achievement in television receivers and fixed mainlines, the extent of use of \nmore advanced technologies in these countries is dramatically smaller than other \ncountries of the world, even after taking account of their relative incomes.  Despite the \nfact that the costs of ICTs are declining, the task of extending access still remains \nenormous.  Affordable access is out of reach of many people in developing countries.  \nThis is especially so for those in the lower income countries.  For example, the \nmonthly charges for Internet access vary substantially in developing countries.  In \nUganda these monthly charges amount to about 107 per cent of annual GDP per capita \nand the figures for Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Senegal are 45, \n118, 77, 70 and 18 per cent respectively (Commonwealth Working Group on \nElectronic Commerce 2000).  \n \nDespite the substantial barriers to using advanced ICTs to support an economic \u2018catch-\nup\u2019 strategy, where access to the telecommunication infrastructure does exist, there are \nopportunities for firms to take advantage of computing power and software \napplications to develop electronic commerce. This is so, despite the fact that many \nfear that the digital divide will continue to widen.  Some insights into the prospects for \nInternet-based electronic commerce can be achieved by examining experience with \nElectronic Data Interchange systems.  \n \nV. NEW ELECTRONIC COMMERCE OPPORTUNITIES  \n \nFor several decades, firms in many industrial sectors have been encouraged to use \nICTs to support Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems.  These systems employ \nstandardised descriptors to enable buyers and sellers to exchange information \nelectronically about the characteristics of their products.  EDI has been implemented \nin sectors ranging from automobiles to electronics and horticulture. EDI systems are \noften developed using sector or buyer-specific proprietary software platforms. They \nare often connected using point-to-point leased line telecommunication circuits.  This \ncreates closed networks for buyers and their supplier members.  The configuration of \nEDI systems has either excluded firms in developing countries or enabled their \ninclusion in world markets on terms established largely by dominant buyers in the \nindustrialised countries. \n \nStudies tend to show that EDI implementations encourage the formation of \nhierarchical commercial structures.  These often revolve primarily around the \nrequirements of dominant suppliers and\/or customers in a given supply chain (Mansell \n1996).  The future of EDI is the subject of debate as innovations in ICTs proceed very \n 8 \nrapidly, but implementation world-wide is growing steadily.  In this sense, the use of \nICTs to support business-to-business commercial activity is not new.  EDI does not \nappear, so far, to have enabled firms in developing countries to improve their \nbargaining power substantially within global supply chains.   \n \nWhy should electronic commerce based on the latest generation of ICTs be expected \nto strengthen the position of these firms? Policy discussions about the potential of \nadvanced ICTs often presume that access to digital technologies will provide a \nfoundation for electronic commerce and that this will embrace firms in developing \ncountries in a favourable way (Primo Braga et al., 2000; World Bank, 1998).  \nElectronic commerce extends the capability of software-based information and \ntransaction systems to support the sale or purchase of goods or services between \nbusinesses, consumers, public or private organisations, using electronic networks.  It \nenables goods and services to be ordered over these networks although payment and \ndelivery may be conducted on- or off-line.  Electronic commerce may support \ntransaction preparation, completion and support. It may or may not be integrated with \nEDI systems (Hawkins et al. 1999).   \n \nThe value of electronic commerce is estimated at approximately USD 650 billion \nworld-wide and ten-fold increases are expected over the next few years (OECD, \n1999). Applications of electronic commerce may be based on proprietary or open \nsoftware platforms and the data associated with these systems may flow mainly \nthrough private networks or through public networks. Most forecasts for the spread of \nelectronic commerce are not based on clear definitions of what distinguishes this form \nof electronic exchange from EDI. Internet-based electronic commerce transactions are \na subset of the development of electronic commerce. With the rapid spread of the \nInternet, it has been assumed that there are major new opportunities for firms in \ndeveloping countries.  This is because, in principle, the Internet offers an alternative to \nthe closed proprietary EDI systems.  Problems faced by firms in developing countries \nsuch as relatively high investment, configuration and co-ordination costs and the lack \nof entry and exit flexibility due to proprietary EDI systems, may be overcome by the \nopen architecture of the Internet and by standardised messaging architectures like the \nExtensible Markup Language (XML).  \n \nOpen Internet-based trading systems are expected to present lower barriers to entry for \nfirms in developing countries.  Lucking-Reiley and Spulber (2001) argue that B2B \nelectronic commerce provides a means of substituting data processing and Internet-\nbased communication for labour services that enable economic transactions. High \nexpectations for productivity gains are associated with efficiencies stemming from the \nautomation of business transactions, the economic benefits offered by new \nintermediaries, the consolidation of demand and supply through open market \nexchanges, and the loosening of the links between vertically integrated companies. \nThese authors assume that firms will implement electronic commerce in an open \nInternet environment, and they acknowledge that there are major hurdles that must be \novercome before the economic impact of electronic commerce can be measured \nadequately. \n \nFirms can adopt the flexibility of the Internet protocols in a closed extranet\/intranet \nenvironment that is supported using dedicated point-to-point communication links.  \n 9 \nFirms may find that this is a more cost-effective solution as compared to the use of the \nInternet based on the public switched telecommunication network.  The closed form \nof electronic commerce may protect their interests in controlling certain types of \nsensitive market-related information.  Some firms are exploring the possibility of \noperating EDI systems and electronic commerce on Internet platforms (Threlkel and \nKavan 1999; Senn 1998).  However, they are also developing ways of setting up \nelectronic commerce on the Internet so that the exclusivity and security features of \nEDI systems are emulated (Mansell and Nioras 2001). There is also some evidence \nthat closed business networks are being replicated when trading migrates to Internet \nplatforms (Kraut et al., 1998).  Firms appear to continue to value some kinds of \nexclusive business to business relationships. Although, the Internet appears to widen \nthe scale and scope of firm interaction, in practice, firms can select closed proprietary \nsystems in some circumstances and open Internet solutions in others. In the former \ncase, developing country producers may continue to be locked into closed networks of \ntraders (Mathieson, 2000).  \n \nThus, it is not necessarily the case that the new technological opportunities offered by \nthe Internet, will lead to new business opportunities for firms in developing countries. \nInitial studies suggest that the full range of electronic commerce applications have yet \nto be implemented, even by firms based in industrialised countries (Mansell and \nNioras 2001). Most firms, at least in the agriculture and textiles sectors, are using \nelectronic commerce based on the Internet to provide a web site to support, but not to \nreplace, their primary business activity.  The web sites serve mainly to support the \nfirm\u2019s information and communication strategies and as marketing or awareness \nbuilding tools. 3 \n \nThe use of intranets and extranets and the development of hybrid sites that retain \nexclusivity for some commercial purposes mean that there is the potential for the re-\nestablishment of buyer dominance and vertical buyer controlled supply chains even in \nthe new digital environment. Intermediary firms (independent of and integrated with \nbuyer firms) are developing electronic commerce Internet-based portals that aggregate \nthe supply of information about goods or services from many suppliers (Goldstein and \nO\u2019Connor, 2000). 4  Electronic commerce may provide a means of reducing \ntransaction costs, but it is difficult to assess the overall potential savings for firms in \ndeveloping countries. Some costs may increase because producer firms are required to \nmeet new quality, time-to-delivery, or other standards introduced by buyers in the \nindustrialised countries. Increased costs may also be associated with system \ndevelopment and maintenance, staff training, and organisational changes. There are \nhigh profile examples of the growth of electronic marketplaces such as Covisint for \nautomobiles and e-Steel, but there are also many failures.  In addition, even when \n                                                 \n3\n  Based on research undertaken by J. Humphrey, R. Mansell, D Par\u00e9, and H. Schmitz for a \nproject funded by the Department for International Development jointly undertaken by the \nLondon School of Economics and Political Science and the Institute of Development Studies, \nUniversity of Sussex, May 2001.   \n4  A portal is a world wide web \u2018super-site\u2019 that provides a variety of services.  The term was \nused initially to refer to general purpose sites, but is increasingly being used to refer to vertical \nmarket sites that offer services to a particular industry; other terms are corporate portal, \nbusiness intelligence portal and web hub, see \nhttp:\/\/www.techweb.com\/encyclopedia\/defineterm?term=portal last accessed 7 July 2000. \n 10 \nelectronic commerce is in place, firms in developing countries will continue to face \nbarriers to international trade such as poor transport and distribution networks, \ninefficient customs procedures or barriers to market access in export markets (Nielson \nand Morris, 2001). \n \nIf the optimistic forecasts for improved access for firms in developing countries to \ninternational markets are to be met, higher levels of network access and reliability will \nbe needed. The institutional foundations for building the capabilities that will enable \nfirms to absorb the new technological systems will also need to be in place. At \npresent, while the list of industrial sectors and firms that are implementing advanced \nICTs to support electronic commerce is growing, it is impossible to draw clear \nconclusions about the significance of closed, open or hybrid implementations for \nmacro-economic growth.   \n \nNevertheless, digital technologies do pose substantial challenges for policy makers \nwho are seeking to encourage firms in developing countries to enter global markets.  \nThe emergence of an open electronic commerce environment based on the Internet has \nthe potential to enable firms to gain access to international markets.  Whether that \npotential can be realised will depend on the institutional framework that emerges to \ncomplement the technological implementations.  \n \n \nVI. INSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS FOR LEAPFROGGING STRATEGIES  \n \nCountries throughout the world are in different states of \u2018e-readiness\u2019 for developing \nelectronic commerce.  Institutional arrangements are very important for acquiring and \nabsorbing these advanced technologies. Key institutional arrangements include \narrangements for network access, forging trusted commercial relationships, and \nmodifying international \u2018rules of the game\u2019 that influence whether firms from \ndeveloping countries can compete on the basis of design capabilities, production \nefficiency, logistics management, and\/or marketing. These areas of institutional \nevolution are essential for developing countries that are seeking to implement \ntechnological leapfrogging strategies to support their entry into the global \nmarketplace.  \n \nAccessing networks \n \nIf advanced ICT applications are to spread rapidly and to include firms in developing \ncountries on terms that are beneficial to them, there will need to be substantial \ninvestment in the ICT infrastructure. Greater opportunities for investment seem to \noccur when the policy and regulatory environment favours effective competition \nbetween telecommunication operators.  Publicly accessible Internet-based electronic \ncommerce also requires investment in Internet servers and software. In the \nindustrialised countries, the availability of high-speed telecommunication links is \nclosely linked with the speed of migration of firms to Internet-based electronic \ncommerce.  \n \nHowever, the institutional conditions that will favour the extension of affordable \naccess to networks in unserved areas in developing countries are not necessarily the \n 11 \nones that have succeeded in the industrialised countries. Experimentation with \ncommunity access to the Internet through telecentres and cybercafes offers one means \nof departing from a \u2018one PC per household or per worker\u2019 model. Telecentres can \nserve as hubs for training and capacity development and offer a platform for \ndeveloping applications such as electronic commerce. They can also provide business \nsupport services for small and medium-sized firms and micro-credit entrepreneurs \n(Marcelle, 2000). These measures offer means of addressing within country digital \ndivides. \n \nResolving issues of access to networks can be addressed from a number of different \nperspectives depending on the primary digital divides that policy makers are seeking \nto reduce. There are two main options for investment strategies: one is to achieve \nextensive growth (i.e. a broadening of participation within an economy); the other is \nto encourage intensive development (i.e. deepening capabilities of those who are \nlikely to have other complementary capabilities for international participation).  These \nstrategies for policy can be considered in the light of four outcomes as a result of \nimproved network access:  1) intensive development in firms that already have \ninternational capabilities for their further participation in international markets; 2) \nextensive development to raise the number of candidate firms for international \nparticipation (but requiring substantial investment in complementary capabilities); 3) \nintensive development of domestic opportunities (to mobilise domestic markets for \nparticipation) with lower requirements for pre-existing capabilities or capabilities \ninvestment; and 4) extensive development of domestic opportunities.  Since the latter \nis likely to be unaffordable in many developing country contexts, this suggests that the \nthird strategy with the policy implication of targeting to achieve sustainable outcomes \nis a viable strategy. \n \nThe implementation of electronic commerce also encourages the growth of data \ntraffic.  This means that existing networks in developing countries must be adapted to \naccommodate changing network usage patterns.  Although the costs of digital \ntechnologies are declining, institutional arrangements are essential to encourage price \nreductions for the services offered to firms. High prices for switched network access \nand Internet service provision are major barriers to the development of open electronic \ncommerce in many developing countries (Souter and Girardet, 2000).   \n \nThe institutional conditions for enabling firms in developing countries to access open \nnetworks must be linked to those which promote the evolution of skills and \ncapabilities of the workforce to ensure that workers are able to absorb the new \ntechnological opportunities.  This is especially important for firms whose employees \nmust make a transition from a skill base that has enabled them to maintain their \ncurrent position in global supply chains to that which is required for operating in the \nchanging international market.  The international market is being restructured as a \nresult of changes in the structure and linkages between firms and in the bargaining \npower of firms that are associated with the adoption of electronic commerce.  \n \nTrusting in commerce  \n \nA key feature of the institutional conditions for electronic commerce is the extent to \nwhich trading can be conducted in a trusted environment.  Confidence in the conduct \n 12 \nof electronic commerce can be strengthened by ensuring that local business practices \nare consistent with those of distant buyers. Emerging institutions in this area are \nconcerned with privacy protection and confidentiality, secure infrastructures, and the \nauthentication and certification of firms. Conventional business transactions raise \nissues with respect to contracts when disputes or misunderstandings arise between \ngeographically dispersed buyers and producers in developing countries.  Electronic \ncommerce raises new issues, for instance, concerning the design and functionality of \nautomated trading sites, the identity of traders, and verification of quality and time to \nmarket agreements. Some forms of B2B electronic commerce may benefit from online \nalternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  These services are being offered in cases \nwhere rapid, low cost redress of disputed transactions is required.  By the end of 2000, \nthere were more than forty such on-line mechanisms.  However, these sites are based \nin the United States and Europe (OECD, 2000), and little progress has been made to \nput these kinds of arrangements in place to support firms in developing countries. \n \nThe use of sophisticated software for tracking and auditing transactions creates the \npotential for the compilation of detailed profiles of inter-firm transactions. Proving the \norigin, receipt and integrity of information and identifying trading partners are \nessential for electronic trading. In conventional commerce, relationships between \nbuyers in the industrialised countries, export organisations and producers in \ndeveloping countries are often subject to stringent monitoring and auditing of \nprocedures for production and processing systems (Dolan and Humphrey, 2000).  If \nelectronic commerce systems result in a reduction of face-to-face contact, then the \ndata generated by electronic monitoring and auditing of performance will become an \nincreasingly valuable resource.  Firms in developing countries will be disadvantaged if \nthey do not have access to such information. \n \nTrust services must be interoperable if an open international trading environment is to \ndevelop.  In the industrialised countries, financial service firms, information \ntechnology firms, and government organisations such as national post offices are \noffering these services (Mansell et al., 2000).  However, there is ongoing debate about \nwhether these services should be based on proprietary or open standards.  The \nemergence of new institutions in this area has implications for costs of participation of \ndeveloping country firms if a number of incompatible trust infrastructures emerge.  \n \nRules of International Trade  \n \nFor governments and firms in developing countries, the spread of electronic \ncommerce implies an increasingly tight interlocking of national and international \ninstitutions.  The terms of these institutional arrangements play an essential role in \nestablishing the conditions of entry into international markets for firms in developing \ncountries. The World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) promotion of trade and investment \nliberalisation is aimed at facilitating access to the network infrastructures.  The WTO \nAgreement on Basic Telecommunications is encouraging developing countries to \nliberalise their markets and the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) is \nencouraging a move towards low tariffs on computer equipment in signatory \ncountries.. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides for binding \nliberalisation commitments on market access that affects the supply of services that \nunderpin electronic commerce.  In principle, the liberalisation of markets should make \n 13 \nit easier for developing countries to benefit from the transfer of advanced ICTs. In \npractice, major barriers to imports continue to exist for many countries. \n \nThe rules for international trade involving electronic commerce also involve the \ntreatment of digital content.  WTO deliberations are influencing whether \ndownloadable digital information products are treated as goods or services.  The \noutcomes of institutional developments in this area affect the terms and conditions \nunder which firms in developing countries are able to access digital information \nservices.  Many content creators are seeking stronger enforcement of intellectual \nproperty rights.  Issues such as posting copyrighted material on public web sites, the \nprotection of technical designs and other materials, and licensing arrangements for the \nuse of copyrighted information are being addressed by the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization and by the WTO.  \n \nThe Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Agreement, which is \nadministered by the WTO, obliges mutually reciprocal intellectual property rights \nprotection, but the costs of enforcement are high for developing countries.  This is not \nonly because of the direct costs of creating the institutional means of enforcement, but \nbecause of the costs associated with accessing protected information that is needed to \nsupport economic and social development. In B2B electronic commerce, the evolution \nof intellectual property institutions is essential to achieve a balance between ensuring \nthat intellectual property protection promotes access to new sources of information \nwhile protecting the rights of information producers within and outside developing \ncountries. Given the importance of encouraging access to local and global information \nservices, the evolution of institutions in this area needs to be assessed carefully to \ndetermine whether new rules are in line with developing country requirements.  \n \nAnother area of institutional development that influences the success of technological \nleapfrogging strategies is the tax revenue collection regime. Most industrialised \ncountry authorities argue that existing arrangements for taxation should be applied to \nelectronic commerce. However, the workability of any taxation regime depends on a \nglobal consensus about how to apply the tax rules. For developing countries that are \nalready struggling to introduce enforceable tax rules, the need to adapt existing rules \nfor electronic commerce presents further challenges and means that more costs will be \nincurred.  \n \nIn summary, institutional evolution is the essential underpinning for strategies aimed \nat using advanced ICTs to stimulate economic growth.  Localised versions of key \ninstitutions are necessary if producer firms in developing countries are to take \nadvantage of the opportunities presented by digital technologies. Mobilising co-\noperation to develop nascent institutions is a major challenge because of the large \nnumber of public and private sector actors with an interest in the economic outcomes \nassociated with available alternatives. There also are major deficits in the skill base \nneeded to promote the evolution of appropriate local institutions and to tailor \nelectronic systems to the specific needs of each industrial sector and firm. \n \n \nVII. CONCLUSION \n \n 14 \nThere is an urgent need to devote resources to ensuring that skilled individuals are \navailable to foster evolving forms of electronic commerce that are responsive to the \nsocial and economic goals of developing countries.  It seems that too much attention is \nnow being focused on reducing digital divides that stem from differences in ICT \ninvestments.  It is imperative that measures to develop electronic commerce and to \ndevise broader ICT-related leapfrogging strategies are embedded within the \nframework of appropriate institutions and development goals.   \n \nThe empirical evidence does not yet provide a basis for concluding that the new \ndigital opportunities, and specifically the adoption of electronic commerce, offer a \nbasis for long term economic gains for most developing countries.  The availability of \nthe Internet will not reduce barriers to international trade if electronic commerce \nimplementation replicates the distribution of market power that characterises supply \nchains that currently rely on EDI systems.  There are many interesting examples of firms \nin developing countries that are benefiting from the new electronic modes of trade.  But \nthe prospects for the majority of firms depend on how the nascent institutions evolve to \nsupport electronic commerce.  \n \nThe development of ICT-related skills and management capabilities is essential for \ndeveloping countries if they are to improve their capacity to absorb advanced ICTs. \nThe Internet offers a potentially open platform for trading, but policies are needed to \npromote access to networks, to develop trust in the electronic trading environment, \nand to ensure that the rules for international trade do not disadvantage (or exclude) \nfirms in developing countries.  In the case of electronic commerce, there are signs that \ndominant buyer firms are using the new technologies to achieve a degree of enclosure \nthat may disadvantage firms in developing countries.   \n \nThe development of partnerships between governments and the private sector to \nmobilise investment in education and skills, to build institutions to support the use of \nadvanced ICTs, and to promote the absorption of advanced hardware and software is \ncrucial for the success of technological leapfrogging strategies. Identifying and \nmeasuring the different pathways for success will become more important as \ninternational trade relies more intensively on these technologies.  \n \nPatterns of ICT diffusion in relation to country wealth and education attainment \nsuggest that catch-up strategies may be successful in stimulating the entry of \ndeveloping country firms into international markets. But without appropriate \ninstitutions to promote the spread of the gains from such strategies, enclaves of \ndevelopment will persist.  Governments and firms are mobilising resources to \nestablish the necessary institutions, but a major challenge is to secure the continuity of \nfinancing for new initiatives. Another is to achieve consistency in setting out priorities \nfor investment that favour either intensive or extensive development strategies for \nICTs. \n \nThe likelihood of the favourable outcomes that are predicted by theories of the \ndeterminants of productivity improvement and gains from factor price equalisation \ndynamics cannot be assessed because of the absence of an evidence base that is \nadequate to the task.  Economic policy must therefore continue to be guided by \n 15 \nevidence of the successes and failures of digital opportunity initiatives at the firm \nlevel.  \n \n 17 \n \nTable 1 Digital Divide Indicators by Income Level and by Region \nCountry Groups Population \n1999  \nGDP 1998 Telephone \nMainlines 1999 \nCellular \nMobile \nTelephone \nSubscribers \nPersonal \nComputers \n1999 \n \nInternet \nUsers 1998 \nEstimated \nInternet Host \nComputers \nJan 2000 \nTelevision \nReceivers \n1998 \n \n % % % % % % % % \nLow-Income 35.1 2.8 3.9 0.6 1.8 0.5 0.1 8.2 \nMiddle-Income Low 39.4 8.4 24.3 13.0 9.4 4.0 0.6 39.3 \nMiddle-Income Upper 9.8 8.8 11.9 12.0 7.2 5.6 2.6 11.5 \nHigh-Income 15.7 80.0 59.9 74.4 81.7 89.9 96.7 41.1 \nWorld 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 \n         \nAfrica 10.46 0.84 1.01 0.75 1.16 n.a. 0.25 1.76 \nAsia & Pacific 56.16 25.39 30.55 33.18 23.07 n.a. 7.50 43.13 \nEurope 14.55 32.51 35.19 36.61 29.58 n.a. 14.02 26.40 \nMiddle East & North Africa 5.15 2.77 3.23 1.36 2.28 n.a. 0.26 3.28 \nAmerica 13.67 38.49 30.01 28.11 43.91 n.a. 77.97 25.45 \nWorld 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 \nNote: Data are for the nearest year available and are rounded up. \nSource: ITU World Telecommunication Indicators Database,5\nth\n edition (June 2000 updated). \n \n \n \n 18 \nFigure 1.
