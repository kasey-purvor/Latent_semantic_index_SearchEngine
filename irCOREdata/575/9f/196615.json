Biologists need to ask complex queries of this data\nto test and drive their research hypotheses. Typically, each\ndata source provides an advanced query interface on their\nwebsite to satisfy this requirement.

A fur-\nther problem the researcher has is that they often need to\nquery more than one data source, necessitating mastering\nmore than one interface and having to cut and paste\nresults between the sites. If the analysis involves high-\nthroughput data, this approach is not usually scalable. To\novercome this problem, many groups rely on bioinforma-\nticians who can generate scripts to interact with the vary-\ning programmatic interfaces of the different data sources.\nThey also often have to learn a number of different web\nservices or application programmatic interfaces (APIs) for\neach resource. A preferable solution would be to have\ngeneric software that a biologist can use on top of any data\nsource. BioMart[1] is such a solution.\nBioMart is an open source data management system that\ncomes with a range of query interfaces that allow users to\ngroup and refine data based upon many different criteria.\nIn addition, the software features a built-in query opti-\nmiser for fast data retrieval. A BioMart installation can\nprovide domain-specific querying of a single data source\nor function as a one-stop shop (web portal) to a wide\nrange of BioMarts as our central portal [2] does. All\nBioMart websites have the same look and feel (only vary-\ning in colour scheme and branding), which has obvious\nadvantages to users moving between different resources.\nHowever, the power of the system comes from integrated\nquerying of the different BioMarts. If any datasets share\ncommon identifiers (such as Ensembl gene IDs or Uni-\nprot IDs) or even mappings to a common genome assem-\nbly, these can be used to link BioMarts together in\nintegrated queries. Additionally, these datasets do not\nhave to be located on the same server or even at the same\ngeographical location. This distributed solution has many\nadvantages; not least of which is the fact that each site can\nutilise their own domain expertise to deploy their\nBioMart.\nBioMart also has the advantage of being integrated with\nexternal software packages such as BioConductor [3], the\nDistributed Annotation System (DAS) [4], Galaxy [5],\nCytoscape [6], Taverna [7]. This enables users to perform\nintegrated queries with non-BioMart data sources as well\nas detailed analysis of the results. BioMart is also part of\nthe GMOD (Generic Model Organism Database) [8] suite\nof tools for building a model organism site.\nOriginally developed for the Ensembl genome browser [9]\nas the EnsMart data warehouse [10], BioMart has now\nbecome a fully generic data integration solution.\nAlthough applicable to any type of data, BioMart is partic-\nularly suited for advanced searching of the complex\ndescriptive data typically found in biological datasets.\nNumerous BioMarts have now been installed by external\ngroups, in large part because of its automated deployment\ntools and cross platform compatibility. These include\nmodel organism databases such as Gramene [11], Dicty-\nbase [12], Wormbase [13] and RGD (Rat Genome Data-\nbase) [14] as well as HapMap variation [15], pancreatic\nexpression database [16], Reactome pathways [17] and\nPRIDE proteomic [18] databases (see Table 1 for the full\nlist). A wide variety of analyses and tasks are possible from\nthe publicly available BioMarts, ranging from SNP (single\nnucleotide polymorphism) selection for candidate gene\nscreening, microarray annotation, cross-species analysis,\nthrough to recovery of disease links, sequence variations\nand expression patterns.\nThe range of interfaces is designed with both biologists\nand bioinformaticians in mind. The simplest way of que-\nrying BioMart is via the web interface called MartView\n(either on our central portal [2] or follow the links on our\nmain page [1] to the individual sites). Programmatic\naccess is available via a Perl API or BioMart's web services\n(MartServices). An important and novel feature of\nBioMart is that it offers \"scripting at the click of a button\".\nA user can generate an API or MartServices script by build-\ning up a query on the MartView website followed by a\nsimple click of a button. All the interfaces allow the user\nto build up biological queries by first selecting dataset(s)\nof interest, then the data to view and\/or save (attributes),\nsome optional restrictions (filters) on the query and\nfinally the format for the data.\nImplementation\nHere we will describe a top-level view of the BioMart sys-\ntem as the focus of this paper is on practical use of\nBioMart rather than implementation and deployment.\nFurther documentation on these aspects can be found on\nthe BioMart website http:\/\/www.biomart.org. BioMart is\ndesigned around a simple, three tier architecture:\n(i) The first tier consists of one or more relational data-\nbases. Each database may consist of one or more \"marts\",\nwhich are schema compliant with BioMart definitions.\nEach \"mart\" may hold a number of different datasets. The\nBioMart data model is a denormalised, query optimised\nschema and can be deployed using Oracle, MySQL or\nPostgres relational database management systems. Each\ndataset uses a reversed star model [10] where data map-\nping 1:1 with the central object being modelled is stored\nin a main table. Data mapping 1:n is stored in one or\nmore satellite, dimension tables. Two tools are provided\nto build and configure the mart databases in the first tier:\n\u2022 MartBuilder, to construct SQL statements that will trans-\nform your schema into a mart.\n\u2022 MartEditor, to configure the finished mart for use with\nthe rest of the system. This produces a dataset configura-Page 2 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22tion XML (Extensible markup language) that is stored in\nmetadata tables within the actual mart database.\n(ii) The second tier is the Perl API (distributed in the\nbiomart-perl package) which interacts with both the data-\nset configuration and the mart databases.\n(iii) The third tier consists of the query interfaces which\nutilise the API to present the possible BioMart queries and\nresults:\n\u2022 MartView, a web browser interface.\n\u2022 MartService, a web services interface.\n\u2022 MartURLAccess, a URL based access to MartView.\nResults\n(i) BioMart website\nIn this section we describe how to use the MartView web\ninterface with an example, followed by a few more biolog-\nically relevant queries that users may perform with the\ncurrently available mart interfaces. For the first example,\nwe show how to retrieve \"the Ensembl mouse genes and\ngenomic locations in the first 10 Mbp of chromosome 1\nregion that have already been targeted as part of the Inter-\nnational Mouse Mutagenesis Consortium \".\nMartView is reached by clicking the link from the BioMart\nsite [1]. The query is started by selecting the ENSEMBL\nGENES database and the Mus musculus genes dataset (Fig-\nure 1A) hosted at the EBI, UK. Next filters to refine the\nquery are set by clicking on the Filters bar in the left hand\npane, expanding the REGION section in the main right\nhand pane and setting the Chromosome, Gene Start and\nGene End filters to 1, 1 and 10,000,000 respectively (Fig-\nure 1B). To find out how many genes would be returned\nat this point, use the Count button in the menu bar. Next,\nthe user should choose the data fields they want to view\nor download in a similar manner by clicking on the\nAttributes bar in the left hand pane and choosing Ensembl\nGene ID, Associated Gene name, Chromosome Name, Gene\nStart (bp), Gene End (bp) in the GENE section (Figure 1C).\nNote that attributes and filters can be selected in any\norder. The left pane shows the summary of datasets,\nattributes and filters chosen. They will appear in the order\nof selection, and this same order will be used to organise\nthe results later. Finally, the user needs to click on the\nResults button in the menu bar to get a preview of the\nresults (Figure 1D).

This involves: (A) select-\ning the Ensembl Mus musculus genes dataset, (B) setting the filters, (C) setting the attributes, (D) viewing the results, and (E) \nadding in the Gene targeting dataset to obtain just the gene that has reached the \"targeting complete\" status.\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22preview can be changed along with the format to preview\nthem in e.g. hypertext markup language (HTML), Excel\n(XLS), FASTA, tab-separated values (TSV), comma-sepa-\nrated values (CSV), or gene structure format (GFF). From\nthis panel the user may also export all the results to a file.\nTime-out settings at particular sites can cause problems, so\nfor these cases there is a 'notify by email' option where the\nresults are generated and stored on the server-side. When\nthe results are ready, the user is sent an email containing\na link to download the results. The 'Unique results only'\noption is useful for removing redundant rows in the out-\nput: for example if a user selected Ensembl Gene ID and\nanother attribute mapped at the transcript level, this could\nhappen.\nThe user now has the genomic locations of all the mouse\ngenes in the first 10 Mbp of chromosome 1 but not\nwhether the genes have been targeted yet in the mouse\nknockout project. To finish this example, a second dataset\nneeds to be added to the query, this time retrieving mouse\nknockout data from the BioMart located at the Sanger\nInstitute, UK. The second (lower) Dataset bar on the left\nhand pane has to be clicked and the Gene targeting dataset\nfrom the HIGH THROUGHPUT GENE TARGETING AND\nTRAPPING database selected. The status filter is then set to\n'ES cells \u2013 Targeting confirmed' and the attributes set to\nGene symbol, EUCOMM, KOMP, NorCOMM (component\nprojects of the International Mouse Mutagenesis Consor-\ntium) and status. This time, when the results button is\nclicked, a single mouse gene (St18) in the chromosome 1\nregion is shown to be have reached the \"targeting con-\nfirmed stage\" and has been assigned to the KOMP project\n(Figure 1E).\nAnother common use of BioMart is the analysis of the\ngenes up-regulated in a particular microarray experiment.\nFor example, a user might retrieve \"1 kb of upstream\nsequences from a cluster of human genes identified by an\nexpression profile experiment on an Affymetrix Genechip\nU95Av2\".\nThis query is started with the New button on the menu bar\nto take the user to a new query page. The Homo sapiens\ngenes dataset is selected, and filters selected by clicking on\nthe Filter bar again but this time the ID list limit filter in\nthe GENE section is chosen. Choosing the Affy hg u95av2\nID(s) option allows the user to upload a file of experimen-\ntally relevant Affymetrix probeset IDs from this Genechip\nusing the file Browse button or to enter IDs by cutting and\npasting into the text box (we include some example IDs in\nAdditional file 1). The various sequence options can be\nseen by clicking on Sequences at the top of the page in the\nattributes section (Figure 2A). These include cDNA (com-\nplementary DNA), peptides, coding regions, UTRs\n(untranslated regions), and exons with additional\nupstream and downstream flanking regions. In order to\nidentify upstream regulatory features in subsequent anal-\nysis, the user would select 1000 bp of upstream flank\nsequence for each gene (Figure 2B). Note that a variety of\nattributes can be selected for the FASTA header line of the\nsequence file.\nBioMart may also be used for annotating experiments or\nfor mapping identifiers to genes and vice a versa. For\ninstance, instead of exporting sequence in the above\nexample, the user could have chosen gene identifiers and\nnames mapping to the uploaded microarray probe IDs.\nEnsembl contains a wide range of external identifiers for\nits genes making detailed annotation possible e.g. GO\n(Gene Ontology), EMBL (European Molecular Biology\nLaboratory)\/Genbank, UniProt (Universal Protein\nResource), UniGene, Pfam (Protein Family), PDB (Pro-\ntein Data Bank) and RefSeq identifiers as well as official\nnames from the naming committees of each species, such\nas the HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee)\nand MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics) symbols.\nAnother typical use case for BioMart is in the identifica-\ntion of candidate genes for disease association. For exam-\nple, a locus for Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia\nwas originally mapped to 14q24 [19]. A list of 172 genes\nmay be identified in this region, with 67 having expres-\nsion in heart as assessed from EST (expressed sequence\ntag) derived data (Figure 3A). Exporting the GO descrip-\ntion data for these candidate genes (Figure 3B) immedi-\nately reveals two potential candidates with a role in organ\nmorphogenesis which is affected in this disorder:\nZFP36L1 and TGFB3. TGFB3 was eventually shown to be\nmutated in the affected families [20]. BioMart enabled\nthis complex query to be performed very quickly and eas-\nily. Following the identification of candidate disease asso-\nciated genes, researchers often screen for SNPs showing an\nassociation with the disease. BioMart provides a quick\nway of identifying suitable SNPs to screen. For each of the\ncandidate genes, the user can export a list of the SNP iden-\ntifiers mapped within that gene, and SNP attributes such\nas their location in the transcript and coding sequence,\nand whether they are non-synonymous (together with the\nassociated amino acid change) (Figure 3C).\nRecently, many other groups have applied the BioMart\ntechnology to help their scientists answer complex queries\nsuch as those shown above. For example, the CASIMIR\n(Coordination and Sustainability of International Mouse\nInformatics Resources) consortium has created a mouse\nportal prototype [21].Page 5 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22(ii) Scripting at the click of a button\n(a) Perl API\nThe Perl API (for download and install instructions see\n[22]) is self-explanatory with the help of an example. The\nbest way to learn and, indeed, generate the API scripts is\nto use the Perl button in the top pane of any MartView site\nafter a manual query has been defined. The script below\nextracts the mouse and human Ensembl Gene ID and\ngenomic positions for all human genes on chromosome 1\nthat have a mouse orthologue on chromosome 2. Just like\nthe website, generating a query involves setting a dataset,\nadding filters and attributes and selecting an output for-\nmat. The user can even get a count of the results just like\nthe website.\n(A) Sequence output options and (B) FASTA output for all the genes found to be up-regulated in a microarray experiment using the Affyme rix HG-U95Av2 probesetFigure 2\n(A) Sequence output options and (B) FASTA output for all the genes found to be up-regulated in a microarray \nexperiment using the Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 probeset.

(A) The Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) gene was \nmapped to 14q24. BioMart identifies 172 genes in this region, which may be narrowed down to 67 with expression in the \nheart. (B) This may be further refined to the two candidate genes, ZFP36L1 and TGFB3, by looking for genes involved in organ \nmorphogenesis, according to GO, as this condition is known to result in widespread structural abnormalities. The latter gene \nis now known to be the one involved in this disorder. (C) BioMart may also be used to extract SNPs for the identified genes \nincluding their location in the gene, whether they are upstream, downstream, intronic or coding and for the latter whether \nthey result in an amino acid substitution.\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22use strict;\nuse BioMart::Initializer;\nuse BioMart::Query;\nuse BioMart::QueryRunner;\nmy $confFile = \"PATH TO YOUR REGISTRY FILE UNDER\nbiomart-perl\/conf\/\"\nmy $initializer = BioMart::Initializer-> new('registry-\nFile'=>$confFile, 'action'=>'cached');\nmy $registry = $initializer->getRegistry;\nmy $query = BioMart::Query-> new('registry'=>$regis-\ntry,'virtualSchemaName'=>'default');\n$query->setDataset(\"hsapiens_gene_ensembl\");\n$query->addFilter(\"chromosome_name\", [\"1\"]);\n$query->addAttribute(\"ensembl_gene_id\");\n$query->addAttribute(\"chromosome_name\");\n$query->addAttribute(\"start_position\");\n$query->addAttribute(\"end_position\");\n$query->setDataset(\"mmusculus_gene_ensembl\");\n$query->addFilter(\"chromosome_name\", [\"2\"]);\n$query->addAttribute(\"ensembl_gene_id\");\n$query->addAttribute(\"chromosome_name\");\n$query->addAttribute(\"start_position\");\n$query->addAttribute(\"end_position\");\n$query->formatter(\"TSV\");\nmy $query_runner = BioMart::QueryRunner->new();\n# to obtain count\n# $query->count(1);\n# $query_runner->execute($query);\n# print $query_runner->getCount();\n# to obtain unique rows only\n# $query_runner->uniqueRowsOnly(1);\n$query_runner->execute($query);\n$query_runner->printHeader();\n$query_runner->printResults();\n$query_runner->printFooter();\n(b) MartServices\nMartServices, BioMart's RESTful type web services, is avail-\nable as part of the MartView web application and, as with\nall the BioMart interfaces, designed to be as simple to use\nas possible. It is available from the same location as Mar-\ntView, i.e. if the user accesses MartView using http:\/\/\nwww.myurl.org\/biomart\/martview then they would\naccess the MartServices using http:\/\/www.myurl.org\/\nbiomart\/martservice. Both overview information (meta-\ndata) about the services and queries are submittable (for\ndetails on the metadata services see the documentation on\nthe main site[1]).\nLike the Perl API, the query XML for MartServices is self-\nexplanatory and again the best way to learn and, indeed,\ngenerate it is to use the XML button in the top pane of any\nMartView site to produce a representation of the currently\nconfigured query. The XML to recreate the Perl API exam-\nple above (extracting the mouse and human Ensembl\nGene ID and genomic positions for all human genes on\nchromosome 1 that have a mouse orthologue on chromo-\nsome 2) is shown below:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE Query>\n<Query virtualSchemaName = \"default\" formatter =\n\"TSV\" header = \"0\" uniqueRows = \"0\" count = \"\" dataset-\nConfigVersion = \"0.6\" >\n<Dataset name = \"hsapiens_gene_ensembl\" interface\n= \"default\" >\n<Filter name = \"chromosome_name\" value = \"1\" \/>\n          <Attribute name = \"ensembl_gene_id\" \/>\n          <Attribute name = \"chromosome_name\" \/>\n           <Attribute name = \"start_position\" \/>\n          <Attribute name = \"end_position\" \/>\n        <\/Dataset>\n  <Dataset name = \"mmusculus_gene_ensembl\" inter-\nface = \"default\" >\n<Filter name = \"chromosome_name\" value = \"2\" \/>\n          <Attribute name = \"ensembl_gene_id\" \/>\n         <Attribute name = \"chromosome_name\" \/>\n          <Attribute name = \"start_position\" \/>\n           <Attribute name = \"end_position\" \/>\n        <\/Dataset>\n      <\/Query>\nAgain, note how the query is formed by adding Datasets\nwithin a Query Tag and filters and attributes within the\nDatasets. As for the Perl API the output format can be\nchanged with a formatter setting, counts can be performed\nby setting count=\"1\" and unique rows by setting unique-\nRows=\"1\" on the Query. To submit a query to MartServ-\nices, this XML has to be posted to http:\/\/\nwww.biomart.org\/biomart\/martservice by appending a\nquery parameter. For example using wget: wget \u2013 O\nresults.txt 'http:\/\/www.biomart.org\/biomart\/martserv\nice?query=MY_XML' replacing MY_XML with the XML\nobtained above.Page 8 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22(c) MartView URL\/XML requests\nThe MartView web interface can be pre-populated with an\nexisting query using URL\/XML requests. This can be\nachieved by sending the XML query as described in the\nprevious section to the following URL\nhttp:\/\/www.biomart.org\/biomart\/mar\ntview?query=<XML_REQUEST>\nEquivalently, an XML free representation of the same\nquery can be sent to the following URL for similar results\nhttp:\/\/www.biomart.org\/biomart\/mar\ntview?<URL_REQUEST>\n<XML_REQUEST> can be replaced with the XML query as\ndescribed above for MartServices and <URL_REQUEST>\nrepresents the same query in a URL format. As for the Perl\nAPI and MartService interfaces, construction of the URL\nrequest is best handled by building the query using the\nMartView website and then using the URL button in the\ntop pane of MartView. The URL\/XML request feature is\nobviously useful for bookmarking favourite queries as\nwell as for constructing canned queries when linking from\nan external site directly to MartView.\n(iii) BioMart integration with external software\nA number of external software packages have incorpo-\nrated BioMart querying capabilities into their systems.\nGenerally, this has been carried out to improve their soft-\nware by importing data through BioMart into their system\nfor: (i) further analysis using the existing services they pro-\nvide (Galaxy, BioConductor, Taverna) or (ii) to add fur-\nther annotation to their results (Cytoscape). This\nintegration has been made possible through MartServices.\nAll the requests generated by these external packages run\nagainst the BioMart central portal. Using BioMart through\nthese external packages expands the usefulness of both\nBioMart and these external tools. Therefore, brief descrip-\ntions and examples of this integrated usage are presented\nbelow. BioMart has also been improved by the incorpora-\ntion of external software technologies. BioMart can be eas-\nily configured to become a DAS annotation server for\nviewing of data through various DAS clients.\n(a) Galaxy\nGalaxy [5,23] integrates genomic sequences, alignments\nand functional annotation through an interactive and\nsimple web portal, so no installation is required. The sys-\ntem allows users to gather data using resources like\nBioMart or the UCSC (University of California Santa\nCruz) Table Browser. The user can then manipulate the\ndata in a variety of ways, such as simple intersections (e.g.\nselecting the genes common to two BioMart result sets),\nunions, and subtractions, or more complex analysis using\ntools such as those from the EMBOSS (European Molecu-\nlar Biology Open Software Suite) package [24]. An exam-\nple of this integrated analysis is shown in Additional file\n2.\n(b) BioConductor\nBioConductor [3] is open source software for the analysis\nof genomic data. BioConductor is based on the R pro-\ngramming language that is especially suited for statistical\nanalysis. Comprehensive instructions on how to install R\nand BioConductor are provided on their site [25]. The\nbiomaRt package provides an API to query BioMart data-\nbases for use within BioConductor.\nbiomaRt mimics the functionality of the Perl API, allowing\nretrieval of any of the information that the other BioMart\ninterfaces allow. A second set of functions is tailored\ntowards Ensembl and include commonly used queries in\nmicroarray data analysis. Using biomaRt, a user can for\nexample annotate the features on an array with official\ngene names, GO identifiers\/descriptions and OMIM\n(Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) terms retrieved\nvia identifiers, such as Affymetrix, Locuslink, RefSeq or\nEntrezGene IDs. The package also provides homology\nmappings between these identifiers across all the species\npresent in Ensembl.\nThe first stage in using biomaRt is to load the library and\nchoose a mart to use:\nlibrary(biomaRt)\nlistMarts()\nThe results of this command are shown in Table 2\n Table 2: Output from the listMarts command of the BiomaRt library \nname version\n1 ensembl ENSEMBL 49 GENES (SANGER)\n2 compara_mart_homology_49 ENSEMBL 49 HOMOLOGY (SANGER)\n3 compara_mart_pairwise_ga_49 ENSEMBL 49 PAIRWISE ALIGNMENTS\n4 compara_mart_multiple_ga_49 ENSEMBL 49 MULTIPLE ALIGNMENTS\n5 Snp ENSEMBL 49 VARIATION (SANGER)\n...Page 9 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22Next a dataset is chosen:\nensembl = useMart(\"ensembl\")\nlistDatasets(ensembl)\nThe results of this command are shown in Table 3\nTo set the dataset to be queried, the useMart function is\nused:\nhuman = useMart(\"ensembl\", dataset=\"hsapiens_gene_\nensembl\")\nThe query is constructed with the getBM function. For\nexample, the following will return the Ensembl Gene ID\nand genomic position for genes up-regulated in an Affy-\nmetric HG U133 Plus 2 experiment:\ngetBM(attributes=c(\"ensembl_gene_id\",\"chromosome_n\name\",\"start_position\",\"end_position\"),fil-\nter=\"affy_hg_u133_plus_2\",values=c('215984_s_at',\n'203174_s_at', '215984_s_at'), mart=human)\nThe results of this command are shown in Table 4\n(c) Cytoscape\nCytoscape [6] is open source software for the visualisation\nof molecular interaction networks and their integration\nwith other biological data such as gene expression pro-\nfiles. Cytoscape uses both web services and BioMart\nMartServices to retrieve this extra annotation (see Addi-\ntional file 3).\n(d) Taverna workbench\nThe Taverna workbench [7,26], another open source soft-\nware package which integrates BioMart, allows interoper-\nation between local and remote analysis tools and\ndatabases by providing an environment for the design and\nexecution of workflow experiments. Taverna is able to uti-\nlise BioMart, web services and BioMoby [27] services\nallowing its users to combine over 3000 different\nresources and analysis tools, providing a flexible and\nextensible platform for bioinformatics research. Overall,\nTaverna allows bioinformaticians to build automated\nprotocols that access each data source and integrate the\ncollected results into a suitable form for biologists to\nexplore (see Additional file 4).\n(e) Distributed annotation system\nAny BioMart server can be easily configured to act as a\nDAS annotation server [4] so that any DAS client such as\nGBrowse or the Ensembl genome browser can display the\ndata stored in BioMart. DAS offers a simple system for\ndata federation where a DAS client may be used to view\nthe data from several sources in a single, usually graphical,\ninterface. For example, genes stored in a BioMart dataset,\nsuch as those affected in a mouse strain stored in the Euro-\npean Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) repository may be\ndisplayed as tracks in Ensembl contigView along with the\nusual gene tracks (see Additional file 5).\nA list of the sources available from our central portal is\navailable [28]. This server currently returns annotation\nacross a 'segment'. Possible 'segment' values could be a\nfeature identifier or a genomic region defined by chromo-\nsome:start,end whereby start and end are optional. For\nexample, an ensembl Homo sapiens DAS data source\ncalled\n'default__hsapiens_gene_ensembl__ensembl_das_gene'\ncan be accessed as:\nhttp:\/\/www.biomart.org\/biomart\/das\/\ndefault__hsapiens_gene_ensembl__ensembl_das_gene\/\nfeatures?segment=ENSG00000184895\nhttp:\/\/www.biomart.org\/biomart\/das\/\ndefault__hsapiens_gene_ensembl__ensembl_das_chr\/\nfeatures?segment=X\nhttp:\/\/www.biomart.org\/biomart\/das\/\ndefault__hsapiens_gene_ensembl__ensembl_das_chr\/\nfeatures?segment=13:31787617,31871805\nDiscussion\nAn important feature we intend to implement in the near\nfuture is secure data access. This is vital where certain data\nis sensitive and adding this feature will make BioMart an\neven more attractive solution for organisations looking\nfor controlled access. Adoption of BioMart will then allow\nsecure and simple browsing of their private data, as well\nas the power of integrated querying of this data with the\navailable public BioMarts.\nWe will also focus on new interfaces that further simplify\nmultiple dataset querying. In these new interfaces, once\ndataset(s) are chosen, all the attributes and filters will be\npresented to the user as if from a single data source, even\nif they originate from distributed BioMarts. These inter-\nfaces will also address the needs of users who require a\nsimpler, more limited, query tool. In addition, we will\nTable 3: Output from the listDatasets command of the BiomaRt \nlibrary\ndataset version\n1 oanatinus_gene_ensembl OANA5\n2 gaculeatus_gene_ensembl BROADS1\n...Page 10 of 12\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2009, 10:22 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/10\/22expand the options available for viewing, analysing and\nsaving results. For example, we will offer gene reports con-\ntaining all the information we have on a gene in a nicely\nformatted web page. We will also offer graphical display\nof results such as locations on a karyogram or a bar chart\ndisplay of distributions. Furthermore, statistical analysis\nof results will be provided e.g. whether particular GO\nterms are enriched in the result set.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we have demonstrated that BioMart pro-\nvides a range of simple, but powerful, interfaces for query-\ning biological data. These may be used for many\nimportant research applications such as the data mining\nof large genomic resources, identification of candidate\ndisease associated genes and variations within them, and\nthe annotation of genome-wide experiments such as\nmicroarray studies. BioMart's architecture allows inte-\ngrated querying of resources at different locations. As the\nnumber of publicly available BioMarts increases, users\nwill be able to ask ever more complex queries. The pres-\nence of a services layer (MartService) and Perl API pro-\nvides easy programmatic access for more technical users to\nscript against BioMart and to integrate our software into\ntheir own systems. However, we hope the simplicity of\ngenerating the MartService and Perl API queries via the\nwebsite will encourage the novice user to use these inter-\nfaces where appropriate. The integration of BioMart with\nexternal software adds a further dimension to its useful-\nness as a research tool. BioMart is also part of GMOD. This\nproject aims to provide a free set of software for creating\nand administering a model organism database, including\ngenome visualisation, annotation and literature curation.\nTools currently exist to produce a BioMart database from\nthe GFF3 gene structure files commonly used by GMOD\nand further integration of BioMart and other components\nof GMOD is planned in the near future.\nWe hope that this description of BioMart, and the direc-\ntion the system is heading, will have encouraged users and\ndata deployers to explore BioMart for their own biological\nquery requirements.\nAvailability and requirements\nText Project name: BioMart\nProject home page: http:\/\/www.biomart.org\nOperating system(s): Any.
