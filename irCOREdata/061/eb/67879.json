Comparisons with Rossini natu-\nrally followed, but the question remained whether\nsuch facility would be married to the necessary\nsubstance for a setting of Shakespeare\u2019s play.\nRobin Holloway\u2019s claim (in the Financial Times)\nthat the opera was \u2018make or break\u2019 for Ad\u00e8s may in\nhindsight come to appear somewhat overstated,\nbut there is no doubt that this was an important\nmilestone in the composer\u2019s career. \nThe mildly controversial decision to write a\nlibretto after Shakespeare may have irritated\npurists, but Meredith Oakes\u2019s paraphrase of the\nplay has much to commend it. Extracting from the\noriginal a traditional narrative highlighting the\npower of redemptive love, Oakes simplified the\nplot, rendering it more suitable for the opera\nhouse. The idiom has similarly been updated,\nwith pervasive use of short rhyming couplets\nreplacing Shakespearean iambic pentameter. This\nliterary conceit, mirroring the artifice of\nProspero\u2019s island, does not inhibit rich poetic\nstatements: in the end, one barely misses the bard.\nHowever, the occasional lapse into triteness inex-\ncusably causes the couplets to draw unwelcome\nattention to themselves, as at the height of the rec-\nonciliation scene towards the end of Act 3:\nMiranda: How good they are, how bright, how\ngrand \/ And I am loved by Ferdinand\nFerdinand: Oh perfection of my life \/ I\u2019ve a father and\na wife\nThe discrepancy between the blandness of liter-\nary expression and the vibrancy of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s music at\nthis point suggests that this was not an ironic ges-\nture; the resulting sniggers in the audience were\nunfortunate, but not unwarranted.\nIf the local interaction of rhyming couplets and\nthe music at times create figures of dissonance,\nthe same is not true for the music and plot consid-\nered on the broadest scale. The first act, for\nexample, is dominated by a motif of alternate\ndescending semitones and fifths that is first sung\nby Prospero (a commanding Simon Keenlyside).\nBy the end of the second act, with the lines \u2018I have\nlost my daughter\u2019, the motif mutates into\ndescending tones and fifths. In the third act, as\nnature regains its control of the island, the figure\nis inverted: it is this figure that governs both the\nprelude and the final scene for Caliban and Ariel.\nNo less convincing is the design of Ariel\u2019s music:\nthe first act is stratospheric, circling around top E,\npushing the coloratura soprano Cyndia Sieden to\nher limits (a challenge which, I might add, she car-\nried off magnificently). Recognizing both the\nphysical demands on the singer and Ariel\u2019s grow-\ning empathy for the humans he torments, the\ngeneral tessitura descends throughout the opera:\nSieden\u2019s lowest note tellingly and hauntingly coin-\ncides with the words \u2018if I were human\u2019. \nWhat is truly convincing about Ad\u00e8s\u2019s score is\nthe fact that musico-dramatic structures such as\nthese are not only intellectually satisfying, but\n(increasingly) emotionally too. The narrative\ndemands of the plot and the nature of the libretto\nseemed, on first hearing, to inhibit the expression\nin the first act (with the exception of Ariel\u2019s beauti-\nful \u2018Five fathoms deep\u2019 and the entrance of\nFerdinand), but with the second and third acts the\nmusic and dramatic pacing were wonderfully\njudged. \nThe second act, which concentrates at first on\nthe delegation from Naples, provides Ad\u00e8s with\nthe opportunity for greater characterization (and\nfun). In his aria for Ian Bostridge\u2019s Caliban, he\ndemonstrates a new-found lyricism, offering at\nthe same time a reading of Caliban not as a savage,\nbut as a fey dispossessed prince. But it is in the final\nscene, in which Miranda and Ferdinand duet with\na Mahlerian intensity, that the lyricism reaches\nnew heights. Any suspicions that the romantic\nsensibilities lurking under the music of the first\nact were but another mask for Ad\u00e8s to hide behind\nwere dissipated: the music is both sincere and\noverwhelming.\nIn the final act, Ad\u00e8s\u2019s music and Tom Cairns\u2019s\nproduction finally unleashed the magic of\nProspero\u2019s island (although it is difficult to see\nhow the dinosaur models, which were straddled\non occasion by a variety of characters, added to\nthe ambience). Emphasizing the unambiguous\nromanticism of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s language, one finds an\nabundance of familiar musical and dramatic ges-\ntures, not least in the use of a passacaglia to\nunderscore the reconciliation quintet.

It turns out\nthat while the writing for the viola is idiomatic\nenough, Turnage has something of a love\/hate\nrelationship with traditional ideas about the con-\ncerto. Divided into two movements \u2013 Turnage\nadmitted that in the unlikely event of his writing a\nsymphony it would have three, five or six move-\nments, never four \u2013 the new concerto (completed\nin 2001 and here given its UK premi\u00e8re) has the\nexpected cadenza but one that appears only 36\nbars in! Such challenging attitudes to an old form\ncharacterize the new piece, subtitled On Opened\nGround. Even so the work\u2019s structure \u2013 scherzando\nopening with slower coda, slow second move-\nment and brisk chaconne finale \u2013 bring us back to\nthe more usual reference points for a concerto.\nWhile he acknowledges the surprising influence\nof Walton \u2018in the second movement\u2019, the influ-\nence of that composer\u2019s own viola concerto is\nactually more pervasive than Turnage would have\nus believe. Even the title, while apparently making\nreference to Seamus Heaney\u2019s collection Opened\nGround, seems to point more fruitfully to the\nground bass of the second movement\u2019s chaconne.\nOne thing is certainly as described: On Opened\nGround is, as he claims, one of Turnage\u2019s most lyri-\ncal pieces and might win him an audience for\nwhom the earlier astrigencies were too great.\nViolas notoriously get lost in or dominated by\nthe orchestral texture and Turnage has been\nexemplary in ensuring that this doesn\u2019t happen:\nnot by giving up his love for large forces with huge\npercussion sections, but by giving the soloist plen-\nty of unaccompanied or lightly-accompanied\nmaterial and ensuring the orchestra answers the\nsoloist (at least in the first movement) in a way that\nretains the mood of the soloist\u2019s entry. The ten-\nminute first movement \u2013 essentially quick and\nspiky in feel, with a more reflective coda \u2013 evokes\nWalton from the off in a brisk semiquaver figure\nfrom the soloist (the gifted young Lawrence\nPower with the BBC Symphony under Oliver\nKnussen, Turnage\u2019s former teacher). This opens\nthe work and the movement is built upon it, as\nwell as the brief military brass and percussion flar-\nings from the orchestra. \nMore successful than the orchestra\u2019s comments\non a rather unmemorable viola phrase is the coda,\nwhere by keeping the viola uncharacteristically\nsilent and waiting, Turnage is able to deploy the\nfull orchestra in longer-breathed phrases of deep-\ner texture. Here too Turnage fans can enjoy the\ntrumpets and horns transforming a phrase that\nhad seemed merely petulant on the viola into one\nof real anger. In the wake of this movement\u2019s cli-\nmax the viola has a entry of slow melancholy\nmarked \u2018warm and intense\u2019 while \u2013 in an assured\nmove \u2013 two solo violins play a slower, more tenu-\nous version of the original theme, reeling after the\nimpact of the tutti.\nIn the second movement, \u2018Interrupted Song\nand Chaconne\u2019, Turnage keeps the viola to the\nfore by using a very different approach from the\nfirst. The soloist holds a long above-the-treble-clef\nline while woodwind and divisi solo strings have a\nsimple repeating and lamenting accompaniment.\nAfter a minute or so comes the first of three \u2018dark\ninterruptions\u2019 where the viola is turned from its\nrather shapeless \u2018song\u2019 by an autumnal descend-\ning figure that sweeps across the orchestra and\ncauses the viola to move back to the richer alto clef\nin a mood of nostalgic rumination. Alas, this\nexpressive interlude is all too brief, and the\nsoloist\u2019s limited use of the material within the\ninterruptions is an odd compositional quirk.\nSometimes Turnage\u2019s conscious challenge to\nromantically-expressive string instrument writing\n(danger: too much lyricism ahead!) can feel frus-\ntrating.\nThe Chaconne sees the greatest interaction\nbetween soloist and orchestra in a rather skittish\nfinale as both forces work themselves up to one of\nTurnage\u2019s trademark stamping dance-rhythms.\nThe soloist, as before, reacts by choosing quiet\ncontemplation before the first movement\u2019s main\ntheme returns, though without altering the irres-\noluteness of mood. The concerto\u2019s rapt, slow\nconclusion, with the viola in dark-register dialogue\nwith the double basses before an appropriately\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 73\nenigmatic ending, is one of the concerto\u2019s most\nimpressive pages. Let us hope that Turnage digs in\nfurther to open more of this deeper ground. \nRobert Stein\nLondon, Queen Elizabeth Hall: \nCarter\u2019s \u2018Dialogues\u2019\nIt\u2019s been more than 40 years since Elliott Carter\nwrote a concertante work for piano and orchestra:\nthe 1963 Piano Concerto was one of the high\nwatermarks of the complexity and richness of his\nearly maturity. His latest piece is Dialogues for\npiano and large ensemble, and at its dazzlingly\nexpressive world premiere performance on 23\nJanuary, by its commissioners and dedicatees,\npianist Nicolas Hodges and the London\nSinfonietta, conducted by Oliver Knussen, the\nwork was revealed as one of the most significant\nof Carter\u2019s recent catalogue. \nConcertos have run like a golden thread\nthrough Carter\u2019s output since the early 1960s. It\u2019s\nno surprise that a composer for whom opposition\nand dialectic have been key compositional princi-\nples should be attracted to the opportunities for\ncontrast and \u2018dialogue\u2019 that the concerto form cre-\nates. However, for Carter that \u2018form\u2019 has never\nbeen a fixed structural outline; instead, the con-\ncerto is a state of musical being that each new\nconcertante work creates anew: from the febrile\nintensity of the 1961 Double Concerto, to the inti-\nmacy and lyricism of the 1990 Violin Concerto, or\nthe playful wit of the 2000 Asko Concerto. \nOn one hand, Dialogues seems markedly sim-\npler than the Piano Concerto, inhabiting the same\nlucidly coherent idiom as so much of Carter\u2019s\nrecent output. But a comparison demonstrates\nhow that apparently pared-down language is, in\nsome senses, capable of greater suppleness and\nnovelty than the density of the works of the 60s\nand 70s. Dialogues begins with a solo for cor\nanglais, an instrument whose role Carter has\ndescribed as a \u2018rather sad, melancholy little char-\nacter\u2019, and its haltingly lyrical line is abruptly\ninterrupted by the piano\u2019s explosive, blustering\nentry. The whole ensemble then crashes in with a\nthird contribution to the argument, a series of\njagged, acerbic chords, setting the scene for the\nwhirling drama of the whole 13-minute, single-\nmovement piece: a continuous collision and\nsuperimposition of different materials, in which\nensemble and soloist rarely come together. \nThe Piano Concerto was no less rooted in an\nopposition between soloist and its associated\nseven-piece concertino) and orchestra, but where,\nin that piece, the large-scale structure was defined\nby the development or deterioration of that rela-\ntionship, in Dialogues, the relationships are always\nin flux, the protagonists never agreeing, even to\ndisagree with one another. If there is no single ges-\nture in Dialogues that has the same cataclysmic\npower as the gradual build-up of \u2018poisonous gas-\nclouds\u2019 of chords, as David Schiff has described\nthem, that suffocate the soloist in the second\nmovement of the Piano Concerto, there is instead\na greater sense of formal openness in the new\npiece. Fragments of the cor anglais\u2019s line recur\nthroughout the work, and there is a longer trans-\nformation of its opening melody shortly before\nthe end, but instead of signalling a recapitulation,\nthis apparent structural marker only initiates\nanother stage of proliferation. \nEven in the midst of the kaleidoscopic drama of\nthe work, individual passages emerged with spe-\ncial brilliance in Hodges\u2019s performance with the\nSinfonietta: the leggiero triplets in the orchestral\nparts against the piano\u2019s declamatory semiqua-\nvers, about half-way through; the piano\u2019s\nscorrevole music that interrupted the transformed\nversion of the cor anglais\u2019s line; and the sequence\nof quiescent piano chords before the headlong\npassage that concluded the piece. There was a\nsense of clarity and purpose that surged through\nthe whole performance, and the whole work.\nHodges had the final word in this irresolvable\nmusical discourse with a piano line that disap-\npeared to the bottom of the instrument\u2019s register,\nbut the energy and seriousness of the discussion\nseemed still to be playing in the imagination, and\nwill, no doubt, generate new possibilities for\nCarter in the next instalments of his composition-\nal odyssey.\nTom Service\nBoston: Elliott Carter\u2019s \u2018Micomic\u00f3n\u2019\nNext season James Levine ceases to be Music\nDirector Designate of the Boston Symphony, and\nbecomes the orchestra\u2019s Music Director and\nConductor. Due to previous commitments,\nLevine has conducted only one program in each of\nthe three seasons since he was named to the post.\nCelebration of his ascendency to the directorship\nof the orchestra has already begun, though, with\nthe commissioning of works from a number of\ncomposers, including Milton Babbitt, John\nHarbison, and Yehudi Wyner, for his first season,\nrestoring one of the proudest traditions of the\nBSO \u2013 that of the music director\u2019s active and\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f74\nenthusiastic promotion of contemporary orches-\ntral compositions. It is not insignificant that this\nfirst season of the directorship of this American\norchestra by an American conductor features\nAmerican composers at a time when classical con-\ncert music seems to be about the only area of\nAmerican life resistant to overt jingoism. Levine\u2019s\nearliest plans for the season included performing\nElliott Carter\u2019s Symphonia: Sum fluxae pretium spei,\nand, hoping to link the occasion and the BSO to\nthe triptych, he commissioned from Carter a short\nintroductory fantasy to that work, entitled\nMicomic\u00f3n. This pendant received its premi\u00e8re,\npreceding a performance of Partita, the first part\nof the Symphonia triptych, at Symphony Hall in\nJanuary.\nCarter discovered the title when looking in a\nthesaurus for a synonym for \u2018fantasy\u2019. Its origin is\nCervantes\u2019s Don Quixote, where it is the invented\nname of an imaginary fabulous kingdom. This\nthree-minute-long piece, however, is not intended\nto portray any particular aspect of the action of\nDon Quixote, but rather to indicate that it is prepa-\nration for a fantastic adventure, namely the\nSymphonia. Although Micomic\u00f3n is in four sec-\ntions, one is more aware throughout the work of\nthe interaction of two kinds of music, the first\nlively, slightly grotesque, crooked, and fanfare-\nlike, played predominantly played by brass instru-\nments (possibly evoking ever so slightly the source\nof the piece\u2019s title), with a second, broader and\nsometimes chorale-like element. The perform-\nance of both the new work and Partita was\ndashing, vivid, and masterly, providing ample jus-\ntification for anticipation of the performance of\nthe whole Symphonia, which will be a major event\nin Levine\u2019s first full season in Boston.\nRodney Lister\nBirmingham: John Foulds at Symphony Hall\nThe City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra\u2019s\nconductor, Sakari Oramo, took up the cause of\nthe long-neglected and little-regarded British\ncomposer John Foulds (1880\u20131939) in the late\n1990s, as soon as he was appointed to his present\npost. This February saw his most high-profile\npush on Foulds\u2019s behalf so far, with performances\nof three Foulds works \u2013 one of them a UK and\nconcert premi\u00e8re, another a world premi\u00e8re \u2013 in\nthree Symphony Hall concerts, two of them\nbroadcast on BBC Radio 3. This was followed by a\nCD recording for Warner Classics of these three\npieces plus a fourth, Foulds\u2019s early elegy for violin\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 75\nBoosey & Hawkes Music Publishers Limited\n295 Regent Street, London W1B 2JH    Tel: +44 (0)20 7580 2060    www.boosey.com\nFor further information on Michel van der Aa, visit our website at www.boosey.com\/aa\nMichel van der Aa\nWe are pleased to announce that\nMichel van der Aa has signed an exclusive\npublishing agreement with Boosey & Hawkes\n\u00a9\n B\nen\n v\nan\n D\nui\nn\nFuture performances include:\nHere Trilogy\nBerlin Festival, 14 Sep\n(world premiere of trilogy)\nBrussels, 14 Mar 2005\nAmsterdam, 1 Jun 2005\nHere [enclosed]\nAmsterdam, 11 Sep\nDortmund, 18 Sep\nOne\nWarsaw Autumn, 24 Sep\nBudapest, 10 Oct\nand orchestra, Apotheosis. Intervening in one of\nthe pre-concert talks, Oramo stated his conviction\nthat after decades of misunderstanding during his\nlifetime, and half a century of neglect thereafter,\n\u2018we owe it to this remarkable composer to play his\nmusic \u2013 and play it often\u2019. It is difficult to think that\nany London orchestra would dare to programme\nanything so distant from their narrow core reper-\ntoire and so utterly contrary to contemporary\nfashions. Yet three near-capacity audiences were\nplainly both surprised and enthralled by the\nmusic, and many members of the public\nexpressed a desire to hear more.\nFoulds was born in Manchester in 1880 and died\nin Calcutta in 1939: dates and places that some-\nhow sum up his personal odyssey \u2013 from his time\nas a cellist in the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra under Hans\nRichter, very much brought up in the European\nmainstream traditions, to his exploration of other\nworlds of music. His interest in non-European,\noriental scales and modes (well in advance of\nMessiaen, for instance) as a way of enlarging the\nWestern tonal language, was concurrent with his\nstudy of Indian philosophical and mystical tradi-\ntions. In his final years in India he collaborated\nwith Indian musicians, even writing for their\ninstruments. \nIt was this Indian connexion that allowed the\nCBSO to programme Foulds, as well as Holst, as\npart of their \u2018Classic Asia\u2019 season, and on 10 and 12\nFebruary the Three Mantras for orchestra\n(1919\u201330), the freestanding symphonic triptych\nthat Foulds created by salvaging the preludes to the\nthree acts of his otherwise discarded and destroyed\nSanskrit opera Avatara, showed his fusion of\nWestern modernism and Indian techniques at its\nmost potent. Unplayed in Foulds\u2019s lifetime, this is\none of his most instrumentally virtuosic and chal-\nlenging works, but since its first performance (for a\nLyrita CD) in the late 1980s it has become one of his\nmore frequently-heard scores: these were the third\nand fourth occasions on which Oramo and the\nCBSO have presented it in concert. The coruscat-\ning high-speed polytonal activity of the first Mantra\n(which Oramo takes at a tremendous lick, but con-\nfesses he still hasn\u2019t managed to get up to Foulds\u2019s\nmetronome-mark); the rapt pan-diatonic mysti-\ncism of the second, with its \u2018Neptune\u2019-like female\nchorus; and the baleful, rhythmically complex, har-\nmonically extremely strict (and extremely\ndissonant) raga-invention of the third, display a\ncomposer as confident in his command of a whole\nrange of techniques and of a large orchestra as \nany of his European contemporaries; a composer\nwho pulls no punches and fluffs no opportunities\non his way to the final orgiastic explosion of\naccumulated power.\nSomething of the same grandiloquence and\nambition, at least, informs the very much earlier\nand more obviously derivative Mirage (1910), a\nsymphonic poem in six large sections. Foulds was\nallowed a play-through of this piece by the Hall\u00e9\nshortly after he wrote it, but no public perform-\nance followed and it remained unheard for the rest\nof his life. The CBSO performance on 25 February\nwould have been the world premi\u00e8re had the work\nnot received a studio recording in Luxembourg in\n1981 as part of a boxed set of British Music of its\nperiod.1 As it was, this CBSO performance was the\nfirst time Mirage had been heard in concert any-\nwhere. While one need not look far in this\ninventive and big-hearted piece for the imprints of\nWagner, Richard Strauss, C\u00e9sar Franck, Elgar and\nperhaps Bruckner and Sibelius, there are elements\nthat are more forward-looking (the effective use of\nquarter-tones in the string writing of the third sec-\ntion, for example: Foulds was the first British\ncomposer to systematize and use quarter-tone\ndivisions of the octave) and ideas that are already\nso characteristically Fouldsian that he quarried\nthem from the score for use in much later pieces. \nThe merest wisp of a programme suggests that\nthe term \u2018Mirage\u2019 should be understood in the spir-\nitual sense, as the illusions after which all men\nstrive, and the fourth section (itself subtitled\n\u2018Mirage\u2019), a fleet, cold scherzo episode that dis-\nsolves away all the motifs so far heard, is a\nremarkable invention. To this is counterpoised, at\nthe beginning and end of the work, a majestic\nchorale-like wind theme which Foulds labelled\n\u2018Immutable Nature\u2019. Its glowing apotheosis at the\nwork\u2019s conclusion is the nearest the score comes to\nvisionary utterance. Indeed despite its occasional\nlongueurs and reminiscences of other composers, in\nits lofty philosophical aims, episodic construction\nand monumental effects Mirage is probably the\nnearest equivalent in the British repertoire to\nStrauss\u2019s Also Sprach Zarathustra. Sakari Oramo\ndemonstrated his faith in it by putting the Strauss in\nthe same programme, confident that Foulds would\nnot be diminished by the direct comparison \u2013 and,\nin many passages if not throughout, neither he was.\nBut the highlight of the 25 February concert\nwas a very different Foulds work, one of the most\nunusual in his highly varied catalogue. Lyra\nCeltica, a concerto for wordless medium voice and\norchestra, received its world premi\u00e8re \u2013 or at least\nthe first two of its movements did. There are \n1 By the Luxembourg Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by\nLeopold Hager. Originally issued on LP by Forlane records, it\nwas reissued on CD about ten years later (Forlane UCD\n16724\/25), coupled with works by Hubert Parry and Havergal\nBrian, but is currently unavailable.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f76\nseveral scores in Foulds\u2019s output which, though\nplanned in three movements, only consist of two\nmovements and a fragment of the third. Lyra\nCeltica falls into this category. In fact some 150 bars\nof the finale exist in full score, but beyond that\nonly a few fragmentary sketches survive. \nUnfinished, unpublished and unplayed before\n25 February, there seems to be only circumstantial\nevidence as to when the work was actually\ncomposed. It seems likely that the conception\noriginated around 1917 but that most of the\nwriting was done in the early and mid-1920s.\nFoulds\u2019s son Patrick, now in his late eighties,\nattended the performance and testified that he\nremembered his mother singing the work to his\nfather\u2019s piano accompaniment at their home in\nAbbey Road, London, in the 1920s. In fact\nFoulds\u2019s second wife, the Irish-born Maud\nMacCarthy (1882\u20131967) \u2013 a singer as well as a\nvirtuoso violinist and one of the leading Western\nauthorities on Indian music in the early part of\nthe 20th-century \u2013 was clearly the soloist for\nwhich Lyra Celtica was intended. One of her more\nunusual talents was the ability to sing the srutis,\nthe 22 microtones of classical Indian music, and\nthe solo part of Lyra Celtica includes several\nsweeping, resonant scale-like patterns in this\ntuning system, notably in the dramatic opening\ncadenza for voice and timpani. \nWhether Foulds consciously meant to suggest\nby this the mysterious but genuine affinities\nbetween Gaelic ceol mor (the \u2018great music\u2019 of the\nHighland bagpipe) and Asian music must remain\nmoot. In his time he wrote many convention-\nalized Scottish\/Irish light-music morceaux and\nsentimentals, the best-known being the once-pop-\nular Keltic Lament. But Lyra Celtica is free from any\nhint of such kitsch. Its principal melodies are writ-\nten in the style of various kinds of songs from the\nWestern Isles, and show that Foulds knew much\nmore about this kind of music than is apparent\nfrom his \u2018Keltic\u2019 salon pieces. But it is also an\nextraordinary blend of different tonal systems:\ndiatonic, pentatonic, whole-tone, microtonal and\nquarter-tonal writing are all heard at different\npoints \u2013 some of them simultaneously. This cre-\nates an evocative and frequently iridescent\nsound-fabric while, throughout, the delicacy and\neffectiveness of the scoring (for a medium-sized\norchestra without low brass but with important\nroles for harp and celesta) was frequently breath-\ntaking. The opening of the second movement, the\nvoice\u2019s long, chant-like melody borne on a shifting\ncarpet of low, hollow, sea-like sounds from four\ndouble-basses, lingers in the memory.\nThe first movement, after the attention-grab-\nbing cadenza for the soloist (Susan Bickley, here, in\ncourageous form, sweet-voiced and with the vir-\ntually flawless intonation the part demands),\ndevelops as a bubblingly energetic free sonata-\ndesign with bravura passage-work in the first\nsubject and a more soulful, ravishing melody for\nsecond subject. The second movement alternates\na slow but serene chant-like melody using the\nlower part of the mezzo-contralto range (there is\nsome evidence this wordless tune may originally\nhave been intended as a song to words from\nOssian) with a quicker, lighter dance-song as well\nas a second, central cadenza. The movement\u2019s\nfinal dying-away, the voice descending in micro-\ntones while the strings slowly descend also in\nquarter-tones, with whole-tone and semitonal\ndescents in other parts of the orchestra, the music\nso to speak dissolving and fading beyond the limits\nof hearing, is a remarkable and, surprisingly, a\nspell-bindingly effective stroke. Nevertheless it\nfeels open-ended, leaving the listener, as it was\ndoubtless intended to, in a state of anticipation to\nsee what happens next. (The finale fragment \u2013\nwhich opens with the first tutti in the entire work\nwhere the voice can have some respite from her\nvirtually continuous activity \u2013 is substantial\nenough, and adds enough of another dimension\nto the work, to be worth playing, if some kind of\nending could be fashioned for it.)\nIn the hall there were occasional balance\nproblems where the voice tended to be obscured\nby the orchestra, but these could probably be\nremedied by further rehearsal, and no such\nproblems arose in the subsequent BBC broadcast.\nAs it was, the orchestra seemed already to be\nplaying the piece with the kind of skill and\nenjoyment that they now patently bring to\nFoulds\u2019s Mantras, which has become a warhorse\nfor them. One felt one was in at the birth of a\nunique and magical phenomenon of 20th-century\nBritish music. What is Lyra Celtica like? Bax?\nBridge? Luonnatar or Loreena McKennitt? La Mer\nor Ravel\u2019s Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade? There are fleeting\naffinities to all of those, maybe, but mostly it\u2019s\nnothing quite like you ever heard. Yet the \u2018Celtic\u2019 (I\nsuppose Irish-Hebridean) melodic matter is like a\ndistillation of things one has indeed heard and\nresponded to all one\u2019s life. Above all, this is a\ngravely joyous work, quite dizzyingly beautiful, at\na level where discussions of idiom, influence and\nup-to-dateness appear woefully beside the point.\nThat is something that Foulds repeatedly achieves\nin his best works, and this is another such sui\ngeneris achievement. The courage of Oramo and\nthe CBSO\u2019s advocacy of it is most warmly to be\ncelebrated. \nCalum MacDonald \n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 77\nLos Angeles: the Walt Disney Concert Hall\nand New Music\nWhat better event to proclaim the potential of Los\nAngeles\u2019s new Walt Disney Concert Hall than a\nbicentennial celebration of the birth of Berlioz\nwith Simon McBurney\u2019s Theatre de Complicit\u00e9 of\nLondon and Esa-Pekka Salonen\u2019s Los Angeles\nPhilharmonic? \nLet me put my prejudice up front: I\u2019m not into\nsound-and-light shows or making classical music\nsomething it\u2019s not. But as the narrator took us\nback in time to 1803, a huge transparent veil\ndropped in front of the orchestra, the hall\u2019s pastel\nhues subtly metamorphosed, a lone piano and\nthree male singers seemed to appear apparition-\nwise on a raised platform behind the orchestra,\nand we were told that Berlioz originally intended\nhis Symphonie Fantastique to be preceded by his\nL\u00e9lio, which we were about to experience in its\noriginal version. \nAs the sounds of solo instruments began to\nemerge from within the orchestra, and the pianist\nwith singers created their own solo world, softness\nembraced me \u2013 not softness as opposed to loud-\nness but the softness of touch, of velvet and clarity\nand presence, as found in an intimate room. Such\nintimacy was a startling contrast to being hit, min-\nutes before, by the sun-reflecting sails of Disney\u2019s\ndazzling, highly reflective stainless steel exterior. \nThe interior continues the sailing motif. Sitting\nin the gallery on the side with full view of the belly\nof the hall, I was immediately struck by the main\nfloor\u2019s shape, like a Portuguese galleon with seats\nswooping down and then slightly upward to the\nspacious stage, itself not centered but still\nembraced on all sides by audience, with a steep ten\nrows of seats behind the orchestra seeming to\ncomplete the amputated-tail shape of those old\nships. Despite the hall\u2019s 2,265 seats, the immediate\nvisual impression was as intimate as the sound.\nThe lights changed colors, successive slides\nappeared on the veil; and then I wondered \u2018how\ncan those eyes move on that face if it\u2019s a slide\u2019\n(shown, by the way, not only on the big veil but on\na smaller screen high in the upper rear, plus on the\nwalls above each side gallery, and thus visible from\nevery angle without having to crank your neck). A\nhandful of musicians stood one by one and then\nlost their instruments (violins, a flute, a trumpet,\nan entire cello) as they were slowly raised high\nabove the orchestra: Normally all this would\nstrike me as hokey manipulation, and I would be\nconscious of technique rather than the experience\nof the music. But not in this atmospheric place. \nI gradually realized that this is indeed a hall for\nthe 21st-century, just like the new concert hall at\nSingapore\u2019s Esplanade on the Bay, where a few\nmonths earlier I had experienced the staging of a\nlight-and-percussion show when Evelyn Glennie\nand her technician, James Wilson, staged (I choose\nthe verb deliberately) the world premi\u00e8re of\nSteven Stucky\u2019s Spirit Voices (reviewed in Tempo\nvol.58 no.228). Given the flexibility of staging,\nlighting, movement, and even screening that these\nstate-of-the-art halls afford, and given artists of\nsuch exquisitely imaginative and subtle tastes, it\nwas possible to retreat in time, to join Berlioz in\nhis own day, and then, through the sparing use of\ncontinued lighting and projected images, be trans-\nported forward again via the still-unique, sui\ngeneris, and ultimately violent, fantastic symphon-\nic sounds of Berlioz into our own time. As the\nnarrator said at one point, \u2018What is this mysteri-\nous force that enables us to substitute imagination\nfor reality!\u2019\nLest this all sound like hype, let me confirm that\nthe acoustics of the hall (which is the element that\nmatters to me most) kept the music dead center in\nmy consciousness. Though, with my eyes closed, I\ncould pinpoint the exact location of each soloist,\nthere was a surround-sound warmth that\nembraced me. Even the elevated piano behind the\norchestra projected itself with a true, even, warm\nrichness from treble to bass. At one point in the\nthird movement, as a solo clarinet played with the\nentire piano string section, I leaned over to com-\nposer William Kraft and said, \u2018That is the most\nremarkable balance and sound I think I\u2019ve ever\nheard in a concert hall!\u2019 \nTrue, in more ferocious tutti the strings were\nburied by the woodwinds and brass. The same was\nalso true when I sat on the main floor two weeks\nlater, though it was impossible to tell whether it\nwas because of the quality of the Philharmonic\u2019s\nstrings themselves, the present set-up of the musi-\ncians, or both. When I sat behind the orchestra for\na concert, the only balance problem was the\nFrench horns with their bells pointed right at the\nstalls. Also, the chorus, which seamlessly entered\nand exited upstage in L\u00e9lio, sounded clear but dis-\ntant when soft, but warm, balanced, and richly\npresent when forte. In a hall this superb, consider\nsuch criticisms nit-picking.\nThe one area where I do fault architect Frank\nGeary is in his dismal feel for recreational spaces.\nThe enormous dimly lit lobby has the angles, col-\nors, and flat dullness of an utterly prosaic office\nbuilding. The low-ceilinged cafeteria area is\noppressive, and its charcoal-colored men\u2019s room\nhas exactly one urinal. One guy in line said, \u2018Kinda\ngloomy in here\u2019. Also, if you exit the auditorium\non the violin side, you\u2019re told the men\u2019s rooms are\non the far side of the hall. In the hall itself, seats are\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f78\nsmall, a bit too upright, and pity anyone with long\nlegs.\nBoth Kraft and composer Donald Crockett of\nthe University of Southern California feel that the\nnew hall has a significant impact on the area\u2019s new\nmusic scene. Heidi Lesemann, Director of the\nAmerican Composers Forum Los Angeles, says,\n\u2018In the Green Umbrella series, Philharmonic play-\ners learn five whole concerts full of new music as a\nmatter of course. They used to be performed at\noutside venues; now they\u2019re performed in the\norchestra\u2019s home hall, which itself is emotionally\nintimate and tactile. Composers love to write for\nthe space itself. Now the LAPO is putting its stamp\nof approval on new music with time, money, and\nspace. Even the area\u2019s top music critics are into\nnew music\u2019.\nCrockett added, \u2018At Green Umbrella, atten-\ndance has tripled with the new hall. Driven by\nSalonen, [New Music Consultant] Stucky, and the\nLAPO\u2019s upper management all genuinely excited\nby new music, as a team they feel it\u2019s the way to go\nto keep the orchestra alive. And there\u2019s a buzz\nabout it that extends out to other performers as\nwell\u2019.\nIn addition, underneath the Disney Concert Hall\nis the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theatre (RED-\nCAT), the new performance home for CalArts, a\nsmall liberal arts college that pushes music, dance,\ntheatre, film\/video, and visual arts in experimental\ndirections. According to the Dean (and composer),\nDavid Rosenboom, \u2018There\u2019s lots of multi-discipli-\nnary space and technology, flexible seating for\nabout 285 people, and fabulous variable acoustics\nwith movable reflectors for the right dispersal of\nsound, plus multiple sound systems for films, etc.\u2019\nHe agrees with composer John Williams: \u2018Students\neither get past identifying themselves into tradi-\ntional categories, or they get out of CalArts. They\nlearn to improvise and interface with technology.\nThere\u2019s lots of ethic, jazz, and world music as well \u2013\nthe borders break down here\u2019. \nComposer Dorrance Stalvey, Director of the\nfamed Monday Evening Concerts held near\nBeverly Hills, adds, \u2018While the focus of CalArts\nchanges according to its faculty, Monday Evening\nConcerts remain a good solid footing in tradition-\nal 20th-century works but also keeps in touch with\nthe cutting edge of mixed media, electronics, and\ntechnical advances\u2019. \nNone of the composers I talked to felt that the\narea\u2019s gigantic film and television music industry\nhad much impact on the new music scene, and\nmost were amazingly ambiguous about the\nimpact of the area\u2019s enormous immigrant popula-\ntion on it as well, though Lesemenn observed,\n\u2018With 96 languages being spoken in L.A. area\nschools, all these cultures have broken things up\nand change the perception of concert hall music\nand what\u2019s allowable\u2019. \nDean Corey, who\u2019s been in music management\nfrom 25 years and is executive director of one of\nthe area\u2019s largest presenting organizations, said,\n\u2018Music itself isn\u2019t in trouble; just the delivery sys-\ntems are in question\u2019. He\u2019s one of many who\nthinks that, with the unique focus the Disney Hall\nhas given to music in L.A., it\u2019s definitely part of\nthe solution.\nGil French\nLondon, Trinity College: David Johnson\u2019s\n\u2018Sorry, False Alarm\u2019\nAn opera which runs for less than an hour and\nhas 20 solo parts might seem destined to remain\nunperformed, but Scottish composer David\nJohnson\u2019s Sorry, False Alarm was composed as a\ntraining opera for students, and a workshop pro-\nduction by singers from Trinity College of Music\n(24 March, Greenwich) demonstrated that it fits\nits purpose admirably. \nThe 20 soloists also form a chorus which intro-\nduces the story, fairy tale style (\u2018Once upon a time\n...\u2019), and re-enters at intervals to link the scenes\nand move the plot forwards. Johnson writes that\nthe opera\u2019s \u2018narrative method comes from chil-\ndren\u2019s bedtime stories, the Grimm folk tales,\nBrecht\u2019s and Weill\u2019s music-theatre pieces,\nStravinsky\u2019s Soldier\u2019s Tale ... held together with a\nstrong dash of Old Testament\u2019. The piece satirizes\na society in thrall to commercial greed and to\nmodern technology which defeats its purpose\nbecause it doesn\u2019t work properly. \nSo, once upon a time there was a small burglar\nalarm factory in Scotland, with dedicated employ-\nees making high quality systems. But demand is\nsmall and the firm hires a management consultant\nwho recommends producing cheaper, inferior\nproducts in much larger quantities. The company\nadvertises its newly branded \u2018Euro-K\u2019 (you\u2019re ok)\nalarms on television with great success. Once\ninstalled, however, the alarms keep going off at\nrandom and so create an ideal environment for\nthe thieves they are supposed to deter. Even the\npolice station which monitors the alarm calls is\nrobbed.\nDavid Johnson wrote the witty libretto as well as\nthe music; the opera held the audience\u2019s attention\nthroughout. The musical style is tonal and sounds\ngratifying to sing, without necessarily being easy.\nJohnson does not use dissonance gratuitously. It\narises naturally from the musical argument or\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 79\nfrom the need for coloristic effects (those alarms,\nfor example). A faint, slightly archaic blues\/jazz\ninfluence makes itself felt at times and the synco-\npated jingle for Euro-K-Alarms came across as\nsomewhat dated in the context of a TV commer-\ncial. It would be effective, though, as a local radio\njingle, and the amusing recording-session scene\nneed not lose its humour if set in a radio studio. \nThe lively, well-projected performance had\nbeen put together in just six rehearsal sessions. All\ncredit to the students, who had obviously enjoyed\nworking on the piece, to musical coach Paul\nChilvers, and to director John Fulljames for bring-\ning the work vividly to life with no scenery and\nfew props.\nJeremy Barlow\nLondon, Royal Academy of Music: Stephen\nDodgson at 80\nStephen Dodgson (born in London, 1924) is not so\nmuch a neglected composer as a quintessentially\nEnglish one, with a quizzical sense of humour,\nwho has never really courted a mass audience. He\nis often described as \u2018a performer\u2019s composer\u2019,\nresponding to commissions from colleagues and\nprominent artists connected with the Royal\nCollege of Music, where he taught harmony to,\namong others, guitarist John Williams back in the\n1950s. His connexion also with Julian Bream led to\nhis lifelong love-affair with the guitar, despite the\nfact that Dodgson never played the instrument\nhimself. His resulting two Guitar Concertos (1959\nand 1972) gained instant international recogni-\ntion. At Dodgson\u2019s 80th Birthday celebration\nconcert at the Royal Academy of Music on 29\nFebruary, Head of Guitar Studies Michael Lewin\nsaid in his introduction that: \u2018no single composer\nwho is a non-guitarist has contributed in such a\nmajor way to the guitar repertoire, and in such\nvaried genres\u2019.\nAfter a lifetime teaching composition at RCM,\nDodgson\u2019s love affair with the guitar moved into a\nnew exciting phase when in the early 1990s it was\nat the Royal Academy of Music that he was finally\npersuaded to write for a Guitar duo, inspired by a\nspecial project centred on two first-year guitar stu-\ndents, Mark Eden and Christopher Stell. Their\nsubsequent blossoming into the successful\nEden\/Stell Duo led them to commission an\nimportant work from Dodgson \u2013 his Concertino\nfor 2 Guitars and Strings, Les Dentelles, given its\nLondon premi\u00e8re at the Purcell Room by the pair\nin October 2001, and now released on their CD\n\u2018Follow the Star\u2019, including other Dodgson duo\nworks (BGS Records 108). I can thoroughly rec-\nommend this vibrant recording, which comes\nwith personalized liner notes by the composer. \nThe same forces duly reassembled for the RAM\n80th Birthday Concert, with conductor George\nVass and his Orchestra joining the Eden\/Stell Duo\nfor a lively performance of the Concertino to a\nlarge audience in the Duke\u2019s Hall.The work opens\nwith a striking solo cello theme, mournfully\nintoned, later joined by shimmering strings as a\nprelude to the guitar duo\u2019s first entry, precise and\nfull of rhythmic impact. The intervention of the\nsolo cello at strategic points throughout the work\ngives much scope for Dodgson\u2019s inventive\nhumour, as battles ensue with the duo, and even\nthe orchestra is brought to a high unison halt at\nthe close of the second movement \u2013 a \u2018nocturnal\nreverie\u2019. The rhapsodic high-register passages for\nstrings in this movement, and plaintive first violin\nsolo, display a much more accessible side of\nDodgson than was apparent in some of his cham-\nber music played at RAM earlier in the day. The\nclosing Rondo of the Concertino was a sheer joy,\nwell projected by Eden and Stell, with excellent\nensemble, backed by firm rhythmic control from\nconductor George Vass. \nDodgson\u2019s Riversong (1994) also impressed: it is\na good example of the composer\u2019s success with\nprogrammatic style, though it was perhaps over-\nlong in duration for the average music-lover. Like\nthe new CD, the RAM concert also included\nPromenade (1988) and Pastourelle (1993), both for\nGuitar Duo. The RAM concert was graced by a\nguest appearance by John Williams himself, who\nplayed, with immense authority, Dodgson\u2019s\nFantasy-Divisions for Guitar (1970). As a pianist, I\nwas very interested to be presented by Stephen\nDodgson with a review copy of the two-volume\nCD of his six piano sonatas expertly performed by\nBernard Roberts, who has collaborated with\nDodgson since the 1970s (Claudio CD 2001). \nI am particularly drawn to the Fourth Sonata\nwith its quirky opening rhythmic figuration,\nwhich leads on to what is described by Wilfrid\nMellers in the CD notes as \u2018a scattily fast Waltz\u2019.\nThe Fifth Piano Sonata, which I remember hear-\ning premiered at the Wigmore Hall by Bernard\nRoberts in 1993, is markedly less accessible on first\nhearing, fiendishly difficult both technically and\nto the ear; but like most of Dodgson\u2019s prolific out-\nput, it repays further exploration. His use of dual\ntonality, often \u2018unresolved\u2019, and dichotomous\nstructures, display an in-depth complexity here\nthat seems to go beyond the more relaxed style of\nhis ever-popular guitar works \nJill Barlow\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f80\n"}
