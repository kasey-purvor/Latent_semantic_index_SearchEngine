Eight years of magnetic field data, taken while\nthe four Cluster spacecraft pass through, or adjacent to, the\nequatorial ring current, have been surveyed to investigate the\neffects on the Earth\u2019s magnetic field of the externally driven\ncurrent systems connecting the ionosphere, cusp and ring\ncurrent regions. This study extends previous work to cover\na greater range of orbit location and external conditions. We\ncompare the modeled magnetic field from different global\nfield models (Tsyganenko, 1989, 1996, and 2001, hereafter\nT89, T96 and T01) with data from the four Cluster space-\ncraft. Comparing with the different models allow us not only\nto characterize each model\u2019s performance, but also provides\ninsight into the physical sources of observed signals. The\ndata generally deviate much less from the expected model\nfield during the years close to the solar minimum, implying\nthat the models perform better during weaker geomagnetic\nactivity. There are particular deviations from the models as-\nsociated with the ring current (well-defined smooth trends)\nand region 2 field aligned currents (FACs) or low-altitude\ncusp FACs (sharp bipolar signatures). During the ring cur-\nrent crossings (through perigee, at 4\u20135RE), the T96 model\nalways overestimates the ring current, while the T01 and T89\nmodels sometimes underestimate it. The sharp bipolar sig-\nnatures are not always sampled, implying a localized extent,\nbut only the T96 and T01 models include forms for the re-\ngion 2 FACs and T01 appears to model these better. Overall,\nall deviations from T01 are much smaller than for the other\nmodels, indicating that this model achieves the best fit to the\ndata. The 4 Cluster spacecraft observe nearly the same sig-\nnatures at small separations (during the early years of the\nmission) but do sample different signatures at the large sep-\narations (during the later years). Using the four-spacecraft\ntechnique, we infer that the region 2 FACs, with a transverse\nCorrespondence to: Q.-H.

(2007) surveyed the contribution of iono-\nspheric and magnetospheric current systems to the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field, by using perigee pass data from the Clus-\nter spacecraft, based on predictions of the Tsyganenko 2001\n(T01) (Tsyganenko, 2002a, b) global field model. The results\nshowed that the T01 model performs very well in a global\nsense, although absolute residuals between the data and the\nmodel can reach \u223c20 nT near perigee, often with stable bipo-\nlar signatures, which repeat on the phase period of the Cluster\norbit and were assumed to be observed field-aligned currents\n(FACs). In order to further investigate the external current\nsystems in the magnetosphere, this paper extends the study\nof Woodfield et al. (2007) to compare eight years magnetic\nfield data from the 4-spacecraft Cluster array with the Tsy-\nganenko models.\nThe semi-empirical Tsyganenko magnetic field models\nhave been widely utilized in the space physics community\nfor many years. They are best-fit representations for the\nmagnetic field, based on a large number of satellite observa-\ntions (IMP, HEOS, ISEE, POLAR, Geotail, GOES, etc). The\nmodels include contributions from major external magneto-\nspheric sources: the ring current, magnetotail current system,\nmagnetopause currents, and the large-scale system of field-\naligned currents.\nThere are currently four main versions. The 1989 ver-\nsion (T89) (Tsyganenko, 1989) was primarily developed as\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n310 Q.-H. Zhang et al.: Comparison of magnetic field data from Cluster with Tsyganenko models\na simple empirical approximation for the global magneto-\nsphere, binned into several intervals of the disturbance in-\ndex Kp. The 1996 version (T96) (Tsyganenko, 1996) has\nan explicitly defined realistic magnetopause, large-scale Re-\ngion 1 and 2 Birkeland current systems, and Interplanetary\nMagnetic Field (IMF) penetration across the boundary. T96\nis parameterized by the solar wind ram pressure, distur-\nbance storm time index (Dst (Sugiura and Kamei, 1991) \u2013\nor its high time resolution counterpart SYM-H (Wanliss and\nShowalter, 2006)), and transverse components (BY and BZ)\nof the IMF. The 2001 version (T01) (Tsyganenko, 2002a, b)\nrepresents the variable configuration of the inner and near\nmagnetosphere for different interplanetary conditions and\nground disturbance levels. It also takes into account the ob-\nserved dawn-dusk asymmetry of the inner magnetosphere\ndue to the partial ring current that develops during magne-\ntospheric disturbances. The T01 model is driven by the same\ninput parameters as the T96 model: solar wind ram pres-\nsure, Dst or SYM-H, and transverse components (BY and\nBZ) of the IMF, but it also requires a one-hour time his-\ntory of external inputs to the magnetosphere. The 2004 ver-\nsion (T04S) (Tsyganenko, 2005) is a dynamical model of the\nstorm-time geomagnetic field in the inner magnetosphere,\nbased on space magnetometer data taken during 37 major\nevents in 1996\u20132000 and concurrent observations of the so-\nlar wind and IMF. Most of the data set used in the current\nstudy does not correspond to storm time conditions, so only\nthe first three model versions have been used here.\nIn order to analyze and characterize the modelled and ac-\ntual magnetospheric field contributions, the output from the\nT89, T96 and T01 models has been compared to magnetic\nfield data from the Cluster mission (Escoubet et al., 2001)\nduring its ring current crossing (through perigee, at 4\u20135RE).\nOrbits separated in time but \u201cin-phase\u201d relative to the day-\nside, nightside and dawn-dusk flanks are compared, such that\nthe changes in ring current and FACs existing in the magne-\ntosphere are investigated. The results from a particular orbit\nsample are shown to recur in an analysis of eight full years\nof data. Such a comparison with Cluster data provides an\nindependent assessment of the accuracy of the Tsyganenko\nmodels, since these data are not included in the empirical\ndatabase of the models. This comparison also allows the\nmagnetic field behaviour observed by Cluster to be assessed\nin a large-scale context.\n2 Data sources and methodology\n2.1 Field models\nSince the Tsyganenko models represent only the magneto-\nspheric contributions to the overall magnetic field of the\nEarth, we have used the International Geomagnetic Refer-\nence Field (IGRF) version 10 (Maus et al., 2005a, b) to rep-\nresent the Earth\u2019s internal magnetic field in order to model\nthe full magnetic field at the Cluster orbit. The following\nanalysis assumes that both the ionospheric and crustal con-\ntributions to the magnetic field at the altitude of the Cluster\norbit are not significant.\nThe mathematical structure of the T89 model includes the\nmajor magnetospheric current systems: magnetotail current\nsystem, ring current, and Chapman-Ferraro currents, while\nthe T96 model adds the large-scale Region 1 and 2 Birkeland\ncurrent systems and a parameterisation for the interplanetary\nmagnetic field penetration. In addition to the current sys-\ntems mentioned above, the T01 model also includes the par-\ntial ring current with the associated dawn-dusk asymmetry\nof the inner magnetosphere, and a more detailed form of par-\ntial IMF penetration. The pertinent features of these current\nstructures are summarized below. For a full description the\nreader is referred to Tsyganenko (1989, 1996, 2002a, b) and\nreferences therein.\nThe T01 ring current includes both an axisymmetric and a\npartial ring current, with field-aligned closure currents. The\ncross-tail current sheet, which is allowed to warp in response\nto the geo-dipole tilt, has a thickness that varies both across\nand along the tail. The location of the inner boundary of\nthis current sheet along the Sun-Earth line varies with chang-\ning geomagnetic disturbance levels. The contribution of the\nmagnetopause currents to the total magnetic field is repre-\nsented using a potential field and is optimized so that, when\nadded to the field from internal sources, it provides the re-\nquired distribution of the net normal component at the model\nmagnetopause boundary. The general magnetopause shape\nis defined by the empirical model of Shue et al. (1998) and is\nalso allowed to be geo-dipole tilt-dependent. The FAC rep-\nresentation includes both region 1 and region 2 FACs (Iijima\nand Potemra, 1976) which are allowed to vary with inter-\nplanetary conditions such that their ionospheric footprints\ncan move in latitude. Finally, the interconnection field, con-\ntrolled by the IMF, allows the model magnetosphere to as-\nsume open configurations (by allowing a finite B normal to\nthe magnetopause).\nThe magnitude of the total external magnetic field contri-\nbutions from the Tsyganenko models can reach tens of nano-\nTesla within \u00b11 h of Cluster perigee. The majority of this\nis due to the ring current since, at perigee, Cluster is close\nto 4RE radial distance and passes adjacent to or through the\nring current region. At that distance, the dominant IGRF con-\ntribution from the Earth\u2019s internal magnetic field is hundreds\nof nano-Tesla.\nThe other field models use similar mathematical structure,\nbut with different emphasis and definitions of the various\nsources. For the intervals covered in this paper, the geo-\nmagnetic activity input to the T89 model is provided by the\nKp index resulting in quasi-static model output. The inter-\nplanetary input data for the T96 and T01 models (i.e. solar\nwind dynamic pressure, IMF BY and BZ) were the lagged\nsolar wind and magnetic field data from the OMNIWeb site\n(http:\/\/omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov\/); an extra shift of 5 min has\nAnn.

A typi-\ncal orbital orientation with respect to the model field lines\nis shown in Fig. 1. Due to the Earth\u2019s orbital motion, Clus-\nter\u2019s orbit precesses in the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric\n(GSM) coordinate system, so that every year all magnetic\nlocal times (MLT) are covered. The orbital parameters of\neach spacecraft produce a tetrahedral spacecraft formation,\nwhich evolves around the orbit. The orbits are adjusted ap-\nproximately once every 6 months via a sequence of manoeu-\nvres to vary the spatial scales between 100 km and a few RE.\nEach Cluster spacecraft has eleven experiments on board;\nhere, we have used 1 min averaged data from the fluxgate-\nmagnetometer (FGM) (Balogh et al., 2001). In-flight cali-\nbrations on the FGM data routinely determine the maximum\nerror in the data for each spacecraft to within 0.1 nT.\n2.3 Method\nWe have used a combination of approaches to compare the\nresiduals between different models and between different\nspacecraft to reveal pertinent features in the data. Firstly, we\nhave compared the predicted contributions to the magnetic\nfield from the various external current systems at the orbit\ntracks of Cluster, using the outputs from T89, T96 and T01\nmodels, respectively, to assess the behaviour of the differ-\nent models. Secondly, we have analysed the magnetic field\ndata observed by Cluster S\/C 1 by differencing (subtracting)\nthe predicted static IGRF (BEO =BObserved\u2212BIGRF) and the\nmodeled magnetic field data (dB =BObserved\u2212B T \u2212BIGRF,\nwhereB T is the Tsyganenko magnetic field) from T89, T96,\nand T01, respectively. Finally, we have compared the mag-\nnetic field data from the 4 Cluster spacecraft with that mod-\neled by T01 to make spatial comparisons during similar ex-\nternal conditions. This methodology is designed to unravel\nthe predicted and measured effects of both the time depen-\ndence and spatial sampling of the external current systems.\nIn the following assessment, the data residuals are formed\nby subtracting the model values of magnetic field (the Tsyga-\nnenko model and\/or IGRF) from the data (note that we have\nused absolute rather than percentage residuals). A positive\nresidual, therefore, suggests the model value is too small.\nGSM coordinates are used throughout. The Cluster orbits\nare, by convention, numbered from perigee to perigee and,\nfor our purpose to generate a set of data for the whole avail-\nable eight years of the Cluster mission, we have investigated\npartial orbits centered on perigee. Data from all 4 Cluster\nspacecraft are used for these comparisons.\n3 The modeled and measured external current\ncontributions\nFigure 1a and b shows two orbit plots projected into the XZ\nplane in GSM coordinates for orbit 558\/559 on 13 February\n2004 and 1018\/1019 on 12 February 2007, which represent\ntwo night-side orientations at small and large spacecraft sep-\narations. Figure 1c and d shows orbits 630\/631 on 2 August\n2004 and 1096\/1097 on 16 August 2007, which represent the\ndayside configurations at small and large separations, pass-\ning through the cusp.

The plots show the configuration of the Cluster space-\ncraft array as a tetrahedron every two hours along the orbit\n(size scaled up by a factor of 80 for Fig. 1a and f, 5 for Fig. 1b\nand d, and 20 for Fig. 1c and e). Model geomagnetic field\nlines are drawn from the T01 model with the input parame-\nters given in Table 1.\n3.1 Cluster orbit coverage\nFrom Fig. 1a (b), we find that on 13 February 2004 (12\nFebruary 2007) the spacecraft moved from the pre-midnight\n(midnight) sector south of the magnetic equator through\nperigee at 01:00 MLT (02:00 MLT) to the midnight (pre-\nmidnight) sector north of the equator. The Cluster space-\ncraft array passed through or near the outer radiation belt or\nring current near to perigee and passed into the high-latitude\ncusp region in the Northern Hemisphere after about 19:00 UT\non 13 February 2004 and after 06:00 UT on 12 February\n2007. Comparing Fig. 1a and b, we find the Cluster orbit\nhas clearly dropped southward by 12 February 2007, which\nleads to a middle altitude cusp crossing about 2 h earlier than\nthat on 13 February 2004, and demonstrates the southward\nmotion of the Cluster apogee in later years. For the dayside\nperigees (Fig. 1c and d), the change in the line of apsides is\nnot so significant. From Fig. 1c (d), we find that on 2 August\n2004 (16 August 2007) the spacecraft moved from the post-\nnoon sector south of the magnetic equator through perigee at\n14:00 MLT to the pre-noon sector north of the equator. The\nCluster spacecraft array passed through or near the ring cur-\nrent close to perigee and passed into the low altitude cusp\nregion in the Northern Hemisphere after about 08:00 UT on\n2 August 2004 and after 15:00 UT on 16 August 2007. The\ncomparison from Fig. 1b and e also shows the southward mo-\ntion of the Cluster apogee in later years. In addition, the\nAnn.

From top to bottom panels in each figure are for the\nXGSM, YGSM, ZGSM and the magnitude of the field. The black vertical dashed lines show the ring current region crossing.\nCluster array shows that Cluster S\/C 3 and 4 move close to-\ngether in the orbit phase for the 12 February and 16 August\n2007, which leads to triangular rather than tetrahedral con-\nfigurations. The dawn-dusk flank orbits show the spacecraft\nmoves from dawnside (duskside) sector south of the mag-\nnetic equator through perigee at 20:30 MLT (07:00 MLT) on\nthe duskside (dawnside) and back to the dawnside (dusk-\nside) sector north of the equator on 8 May 2004 (4 December\n2003).\nSince the orbital period is 57 h, successive passes do not\ncross perigee at the same time of day, i.e. for the same dipole\ntilt. This issue has already been discussed by Woodfield et\nal. (2007), who chose to compare every 8th orbit in pairs (19\ndays apart) in order to sample the same dipole phase. In this\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/309\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 309\u2013326, 2010\n314 Q.-H. Zhang et al.: Comparison of magnetic field data from Cluster with Tsyganenko models\npaper we acknowledge the issue of changing magnetospheric\nlocations, using the Bryant style format (Bryant et al., 1985)\nto summarise the magnetic sampling during the mission, and\nconcentrate on the comparative modelled and actual residu-\nals monitored over the wider data range (these plots are 2-D\ncolour plots with the colour scale representing the residu-\nals, the x-axis representing the orbit number and y-axis being\ntime relative to perigee).\n3.2 Comparison of the output from different Tsyga-\nnenko models and Cluster S\/C 1\nIn Fig. 2, we show the predicted external magnetic field con-\ntributions from the T89 (black), T96 (red) and T01 (green)\nmodels for the MLT sectors: nightside, dayside, duskside\nand dawnside. The estimated external field contributions\nobserved by Cluster S\/C1 (BEO=BObserved \u2212BIGRF) at the\ntracks of Cluster S\/C 1 is shown in magenta. From top to\nbottom, the panels are the BXGSM, BYGSM, BZGSM, the mag-\nnitude of the field, IMF BZ and SYM-H index.\nFigure 2a shows the night-side pass from 13 February\n2004. During the interval of interest, the predictions of all\nthree models (for example, of the ring current field) are sim-\nilar. The approximate times of entry into and exit from the\nring current region of Cluster S\/C 1 are highlighted by the\ngrey region between the two grey vertical dashed lines (this\nwas determined by the high electron and proton flux observed\nby RAPID (Wilken et al., 2001), not shown here). From\nFig. 2a, we find that the predicted components from the three\nmodels vary as follows: the BX components vary from neg-\native (about \u221240 nT), via zero in the ring current region, to\npositive (about +40 nT) (see first panel in Fig. 2a); the BY\ncomponents are near zero at the beginning and the end of\nthis interval, and vary from negative (about\u221215 nT), via zero\nat the middle of the ring current, to positive (about +10 nT)\n(see second panel in Fig. 2a); the BZ components are al-\nmost always negative and decrease during pre-perigee cross-\ning to reach about \u221250 \u223c\u221280 nT (i.e. for T01, \u223c\u221250 nT\n, for T96, \u223c\u221270 nT, for T89, \u223c\u221280 nT) at the middle of\nring current region (see third panel in Fig. 2a). 1Bmodel\n(1Bmodel = |BIGRF+Bmodel|\u2212|BIGRF|) shows an \u201cM\u201d shape\nwith minimum magnitude of about \u221250\u223c\u221280 nT in this re-\ngion (i.e. for T01, \u223c\u221250 nT, for T96, \u223c\u221265 nT, for T89,\n\u223c\u221280 nT) (see fourth panel in Fig. 2a). This signature arises\nbecause the combined field of the ring and tail currents is di-\nrected southward, opposite to the main field, in the equatorial\ninner magnetosphere (Sugiura et al., 1971).\nFor the February 2004 pass, the magnitude estimated by\nT89 is maximum at the center of the ring current crossing,\nand shows the most significant deviation in the BX and BZ\ncomponents, overestimating the observed ring current. In\ncontrast T96 produced the biggest magnitude at the center\nof ring current crossing for most of the eight years data, as\nis shown in some detail below. The magnetic field estimated\nby the quasi-static T89 model (input of a single Kp at 3 h\nresolution) shows the smoothest features with a small jump\nat the beginning when the Kp index changed (the Kp index\nchanges to 4+ at the beginning and remains at 4\u2212 for the later\ninterval). The dynamic output from the T96 and T01 models\n(through input of solar wind dynamic pressure, IMF BY and\nBZ, and SYM-H at 1 min resolution) in Fig. 2 shows that they\npredict the magnetic field in the region 2 FAC at both bound-\naries of the ring current, but at a lower amplitude than ob-\nserved. This is especially clear in the BY component, where\nT01 estimated a bigger signature than T96. In fact, the ob-\nserved field excursions are more than twice those of the T01\nmodel. During this interval, the solar wind dynamic pressure\nvaried between \u223c1.2\u20132.8 nPa, IMF BZ and BY in GSM var-\nied between \u22125 and +5 nT, and SYM-H varied between \u221242\nand \u221222 nT (see the bottom two panels in Fig. 2a).\nFigure 2b shows the dayside pass from 2 August 2004\nwhere the low-altitude cusp is encountered (see Fig. 1c).\nThis figure shows theBY component predicted by T01 (green\nline) is much larger than that from the other models near the\nboundary of the ring current, whereas the Cluster observa-\ntions (magenta line) show a persistent ring current signature\nnot predicted by the models. During this pass, the IMF BZ\nvaries between about \u22125 and 5 nT, and SYM-H varies be-\ntween about\u221215 and\u221230 nT through the central region. The\nBX components from the three models increase from nega-\ntive (about \u221220 nT) to positive near the boundary of the ring\ncurrent region, slightly decrease to negative (about \u22125 nT) at\nthe center of the ring current region and then increase (cross-\ning zero near the boundary of the ring current region) again\nto positive (about +20 nT) (see first panel in Fig. 2b). The BX\nand BY components in the measured data are near zero at the\nbeginning and the end of this interval and vary like a distorted\n\u201cS\u201d shape, which slightly increases to positive (about 8 nT),\nthen decreases to negative in the ring current region (later\nincreasing to near zero about 2 h after perigee: see second\npanel in Fig. 2b). The BZ components all show negative val-\nues, but are much more complicated between about \u22123 and\n+3 h relative to perigee. 1Bmodel shows a \u201cV\u201d shape for this\ninterval with minimum magnitude between \u221210 and \u221230 nT\n(for T01, \u223c\u221220 nT; for T96, \u223c\u221230 nT; for T89, \u223c\u221210 nT)\n(see fourth panel in Fig. 2b). These effects arise because the\nmagnetic field due to the ring current is oppositely directed\nto the main field in the equatorial inner magnetosphere (Sug-\niura et al., 1971). It is worth noting the bulges on the green\nlines (T01) and red lines (T96) at the boundary of ring cur-\nrent, which may be related to low-altitude cusp FACs and\nshow clear signatures which are of the order of the observed\nexternal currents. It is apparent from these day and night-side\npasses that the models can predict either the smooth ring cur-\nrent or the short period FACs accurately, but do not always\ndo so, and generally do not show the smaller-scale structure\n(transients) in the FACs.\nFigure 2c and d shows a duskside and dawnside pass on\n5 May 2004 and 4 December 2003, respectively. The con-\nditions during the duskside pass are relatively active (IMF\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 309\u2013326, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/309\/2010\/\nQ.-H. Zhang et al.: Comparison of magnetic field data from Cluster with Tsyganenko models 315\nBZ varies between about \u22125 and 5 nT, and SYM-H varies\nbetween about \u221210 and \u221235 nT). The dawnside pass occurs\nunder quiet conditions (IMFBZ varies between about\u22125 and\n5 nT, and SYM-H varies between about \u221210 and 5 nT). The\nBX, BZ and 1Bmodel panels in Fig. 2c and d show similar\nfeatures to those for the nightside pass. The BY components,\nhowever, show a positive to negative polarity for the dusk-\nside pass and negative to positive polarity for the dawnside\npass between about \u22124 h and +2 h relative to perigee; T96\nestimated the biggest magnitude at the center of ring current\ncrossing. It is also worth noting that there are some bulges\non green lines (T01) and red lines (T96) at the boundary of\nring current, which are related to region 2 FACs. Comparing\nthe different phases of the Cluster crossings, we find all the\ncomponents are smallest during the dayside pass and largest\nduring the nightside pass. There is a clear asymmetry at both\nboundaries of the ring current during the dayside pass, which\nleads to a single bipolar signature at one boundary of the ring\ncurrent associated with the low altitude FACs in the cusp re-\ngion.\nIn a similar manner to the test performed by Woodfield\net al. (2007) we compare the measured external field with\nthe modelled ones. If one of the Tsyganenko models gave a\nperfect representation of the external magnetic field, the pre-\ndicted traces (black, red, or green line) would be identical to\nthe magenta lines. In Fig. 2 we find the magenta lines gen-\nerally lie close to the three model lines for the whole interval\nbut they show clear short bipolar signatures at the boundaries\nof the ring current crossing and similar monopolar signatures\nduring the middle altitude cusp crossing (see Fig. 1). It is\nworth noting that the magenta lines are closest to the green\nline (T01) for the whole interval in each phase, which sug-\ngests that T01 achieves the best fit to the data.\nFigure 3 shows an overview of the external magnetic field\npredicted by T01 at the tracks of Cluster S\/C 1 for the whole\neight years data (from orbit 93 on 1 February 2001 to or-\nbit 1244 on 31 August 2008), together with the measured ex-\nternal field relative to the IGRF (BEO =BObserved\u2212BIGRF,\nas shown in Fig. 2). In this plot format each vertical strip\nis a section of an orbit: the x-axis gives the orbit number,\nthe y-axis is time relative to perigee and the colour scale is\nthe value of BXGSM, BYGSM, BZGSM, 1Bmodel or 1Bobserved\n(1Bobserved = |Bobserved|\u2212 |BIGRF|). The left column shows\nthe output from T01 and the right column shows the mea-\nsured external field (BEO). Note that in this figure (and also\nin Figs. 5 and 6) there are some regular and irregular data\ngaps in the measured field (white areas on the plots). The\nregular gaps, such as the ellipse-shaped gaps near perigee\nfrom the middle of February to the middle of March in each\nyear, and the short white bars near +4 from the end of Octo-\nber to the beginning of July in 2002\u20132007, arise for various\noperational reasons. There are also missing data between or-\nbit 719 (2 March 2005) and 745 (2 May 2005), which can be\nseen as a discontinuity in the colours shown in the plots.\nComparing the data and model panels of Fig. 3, we find\nthat the observed external field is broadly similar to the\nT01 modeled external field (the predictions from T89 and\nT96 (not shown) show similar but weaker features to those\nfrom T01). For the whole eight year period, the BX com-\nponents are negative during pre-perigee crossing and posi-\ntive during post-perigee, with \u201cstep-like\u201d colour signatures\nnear the perigee crossing at around \u22121 h to perigee starting\nfrom each June to December. The BY components are much\nweaker during the midnight sector perigee crossing between\nthe middle of February and March and during the noon sec-\ntor perigee crossing between the middle of August and Oc-\ntober. Relative to perigee, they are negative (in blue) around\n\u22122 h, positive (in red) around +1 h, and negative around +5 h\nbetween the middle of October and next February, and are\npositive (in red) around \u22122 h, negative (in blue) around +1 h,\nand positive around +5 h relative to perigee from the mid-\ndle of March to the middle of August. It is worth noting\nthat the weaker values around +3 h to perigee tend to move\nfrom about +3 h to about +2 h during the later years, which\narises from the southward drop of the Cluster orbit as shown\nin Fig. 1.\nFrom Fig. 3 we find that the T01 model predicts the ring\ncurrent, which appears as the seasonally-dependent trough in\nthe BZ component and in 1Bmodel around perigee: strongly\nnegative in winter and spring (when perigee is on the night-\nside and passing close and through the ring current), and\nweakly positive or negative in summer and autumn (when\nperigee is on the dayside). The ring current crossing (be-\ntween the boundaries of the trough represented by deep blue\ncolour around the perigee) occurs between \u223c\u22120.5 to 0.5 h\naround perigee at the beginning and end of the dataset and\nextends to \u223c\u22121.0 to 1.0 h in the middle. In the orbits around\n420, 600 and 780, dating from spring and summer in 2003,\n2004 and 2005 respectively, the time taken to pass through\nthe ring current is particularly long. The extension of the\nring current does not change smoothly from orbit to orbit,\nbut has a sawtooth shape at both boundaries at about +1 and\n\u22121 h relative to perigee. Near both boundaries of the ring\ncurrent, we find that there are small signatures (positive to\nnegative or negative to positive in pre-perigee crossing and\/or\nin post-perigee crossing) in the BY component, especially for\nthe T01 prediction (see the example in the second panels in\nFig. 2), which are associated with the region 2 FAC or cusp\nFAC. As an example, we show a region, highlighted by the\nblack ellipse in each column, when the Cluster spacecraft\nwere crossing the region 2 FAC. We find the FAC signature is\nincreasingly prominent from T89, through T96 to T01. This\nis because the T89 model (not shown) does not include re-\ngion 2 FAC, the T96 model (not shown) underestimates it\nand the T01 model (the left column in Fig. 3) performs better\nand closest to the measured FAC (the right column in Fig. 3).\nComparing the modelled, external magnetic field from\nthe different models, we find that the BX component was\nstronger, and the BY and BZ components and 1Bmodel were\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/309\/2010\/ Ann.

Note\nthat the time variation in input conditions causes signifi-\ncant deviations in B (see detailed discussion in Sect. 4.1).\nThe residuals of the Cluster S\/C 1 observations with the\nIGRF model (the observed external field, BEO =BObserved\u2212\nBIGRF, column 2 of Fig. 3) show that Cluster S\/C 1 observed\nthe ring current magnetic field around perigee and observed\nprominent sharp, bipolar signatures in all three components\nbefore perigee (\u223c\u22121.5 h) and after perigee (\u223c+1 h) (also\nseen in Fig. 2a, b, c and d). The location of these bipo-\nlar features is closely aligned with the boundary of the ring\ncurrent during the perigee pass. There are some sharp sig-\nnatures around 5 and 6 h after perigee (see Fig. 2a). These\nare suggestive of crossings through regions of enhanced\nplasma pressure and might be contributed to by the current\nin the cusp region. Support for this hypothesis comes from\nthe sharp increase in the electron and ion flux observed by\nRAPID (not shown here). These sharp changes in the resid-\nual component fields are mainly monopolar in shape and are\nmuch more complicated at the cusp region (about 5 to 6 h\naway from perigee).\nWoodfield et al. (2007) suggested the bipolar signatures\nthat Cluster sees close to the ring current are the result of\npassing through, or close to, a region 2 FAC. The components\nand magnitude of the observed external fields are indeed con-\nsistent with the spacecraft passing a tube of current, albeit\nincluding additional filamentary structure. During the space-\ncraft cusp crossing, the residuals show monopolar structures\nwith a decrease in magnetic field magnitude, which might\nindicate that the spacecraft passes through or close to a cur-\nrent system not parallel to the main magnetic field, poorly\nestimated by the Tsyganenko models (magnetic field depres-\nsions associated with the cusps were extensively discussed\nby Tsyganenko and Russell, 1999, and Tsyganenko, 2009).\n4 Results for the measured residuals\n4.1 Comparison between Cluster data and the different\nTsyganenko models\nFigure 4 shows the data residuals after differencing the\nCluster S\/C 1 observations with the predictions from the\nT89 (black), T96 (red) and T01 (green) models (dB =\nBObserved\u2212B T\u2212BIGRF) respectively for: (a) the nightside\npass on 13 February 2004, (b) the dayside pass on 2 Au-\ngust 2004, (c) the duskside pass on 8 May 2004 and (d) the\ndawnside pass on 4 December 2003. From top to bottom the\npanels in each of Fig. 4a\u2013d are for the dBXGSM, dBYGSM,\ndBZGSM and the residuals in the magnitude of the field. As\nin Fig. 2, the grey shaded region shows the ring current ex-\ntent as defined by the energetic particle flux. The residuals\nare almost zero except during the crossings of the ring cur-\nrent, region 2 FAC and cusp current regions. These resid-\nuals measure the degree to which the model currents match\nthe measured behaviour on these days. The residuals show\nthat the models overestimate or underestimate the contribu-\ntions of the ring current, underestimate the contributions of\nthe FAC, especially the region 2 FAC, and do not identify the\ncontributions from the cusp current (about 5 h after perigee in\nFig. 4a). The offset between the data and the predicted value\nof the magnetic field within the region 2 FAC reaches a max-\nimum of approximately 50 nT (e.g. Fig. 4a), and a maximum\nof about 20 nT within the ring current. These differences\nalso depend on the global orbital orientation, represented by\neach pass in Fig. 4a\u2013d (dayside, nightside, and both flanks).\nThe sharp signatures, associated with the region 2 FAC or the\ncusp FAC, are shown in all three components for the night-\nside pass, mainly in BY with weaker signatures in BX for\nthe dayside pass, mainly in BX with weaker signatures in BY\nfor the duskside pass and mainly shown in BX with weaker\nsignatures in BY and BZ for the dawnside pass. This might\nreflect the distribution of FACs at different local times. Com-\nparing the residuals from the different models, we find that\nthey all show similar features during the whole interval, par-\nticularly in the BY component. From the residual of the mag-\nnitude, we find that for these cases, T96 overestimated the\nring current (positive residuals) and the other models under-\nestimated it (negative residuals). None of the models identify\nthe cusp current.\nComparing the residuals relative to the Tsyganenko mod-\nels with those relative to IGRF only (in Fig. 2), we find the\nTsyganenko models estimate the ring current well, but give a\npoor estimate of the field strength arising from region 2 FAC.\nThe cusp currents remain largely un-modeled. Thus, we find\nthat, while clear signatures of FACs and cusp persist in the\ntraces in Fig. 4, the deviations in the ring current are differ-\nent for each model. It is interesting to note that in most of\nthe regions sampled, the BY component shows very similar\nresiduals from the 3 models. Additionally, in the dawnside\nand dayside regions (Fig. 4b, d), BX shows similar residuals\nfor all models. These effects are reflected in the trends seen\nover the whole mission as discussed below (in Fig. 5).\nFigure 5 shows the residuals from the comparisons of\nCluster S\/C 1 observations with T89, T96 and T01 models\n(dB =BObserved\u2212B T\u2212BIGRF) for the whole eight years of\ndata in a similar format to Fig. 3. Residuals are shown from\nT89, T96 and T01 respectively from left to right columns.\nThe T89 and T01 models generally underestimated the ring\ncurrent in the earlier 4 or 5 years, while the T96 overesti-\nmated it almost for the whole 8 years. For T89, the dBX com-\nponent in GSM coordinates deviates much more than the oth-\ners, so that the pre-perigee crossing (in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere) is underestimated and the post-perigee crossing (in\nthe Northern Hemisphere) is overestimated. The dBY com-\nponent is similar for all the models, and the behaviour is gov-\nerned more by the external conditions, but is progressively\nunderestimated during the later years. For T96, dBX and\ndBY vary between the results for T89 and T01. dBZ shows\nsimilar, but more complicated, behaviour. For T01, all of the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/309\/2010\/ Ann.

From top to bottom panels of Fig. 5a\u2013d are for the dBXGSM, dBYGSM, dBZGSM and the magnitude of the\nfield. The black vertical lines show the ring current region crossing.\ncomponents of the deviations are much smaller than from the\nother models, indicating that this model best fits the data. The\ntime-varying input parameters return a time-varying model\nfield since the magnetospheric response is partially contained\nin T01. Although this time varying input provides a better fit\nto the data the residuals have less meaning. Nevertheless, it\nis clear that the features indicated by the line plots (Fig. 4),\nfor FAC and cusp, persist throughout. The T01 deviations\nrevealed are weaker during the later years, which might be\nbecause of the approach to solar minimum with reducing ge-\nomagnetic activity. (The IMF conditions and SYM-H index\n(not shown) confirm that conditions are broadly active dur-\ning the first four and a half years (from orbit 93 to \u223c800) and\nquiet in the later years (from orbit \u223c800 to 1244)).\nAs mentioned above, the lines of apsides of the Cluster\nspacecraft drop southward in the later years,. In order to\ninvestigate the regions encountered at different times due\nto this dropping, we compare in detail three months (Jan-\nuary to March) of results from 2004 and 2007.

These tend to show underestimated signa-\ntures around \u00b11.0 h of perigee in dBZ. The T89 model, how-\never, does not include (and the T96 model does not well re-\nproduce) the region 2 FACs, resulting in larger residuals. The\ndeviations also show that there are underestimated signatures\n(redder colour, especially in dBZ), reflecting the contribu-\ntions of the cusp current system, between \u223c+3.0 and +6.0 h\nfor the whole three months of 2004, and between \u223c+1.0 and\n+3.0 h for the whole three months of 2007, again a result of\nthe progressive dropping southward of the Cluster orbit as\nshown in Fig. 1.\n4.2 Comparisons between the 4 Cluster spacecraft\nIn order to further investigate the cause of the bipolar signa-\ntures we have attributed to FACs in the previous section we\nmake use of the multi-spacecraft nature of the Cluster mis-\nsion. By studying the individual spacecraft residuals from\nT01 for the whole eight years of data (not shown), we find\nthat the residuals are almost the same at all 4 spacecraft.\nThere are some clear differences in the dBX and dBY compo-\nnents in later years, as a consequence of the larger spacecraft\nseparations. At the boundary of the ring current in the later\nyears, the Cluster S\/C 2 observed the strongest signatures,\nfollowed by S\/C 1; S\/C 3 and 4 measured almost the same\nfeatures. This might be because Cluster S\/C 2 is always lo-\ncated outermost, S\/C 1 follows and S\/C 3 and 4 are located\ninnermost (and move almost together: see, for example, the\nconfigurations in Fig. 1), resulting in each spacecraft cross-\ning or passing close to different parts of the FAC.\nFigure 7 demonstrates the effects of the different space-\ncraft separations and orientations on the magnetic field resid-\nuals. Figure 7a shows the nightside passes on 13 February\n2004 (small average separation, \u223c160 km) in the left-hand\npanels and on 12 February 2007 (large average separation,\n\u223c1600 km) in the right-hand panels. The left and right pan-\nels in Fig. 7b similarly show the dayside passes on 2 Au-\ngust 2004 (middle average separation, \u223c720 km) and on 16\nAnn.

Continued.\nAugust 2007 (large average separation, \u223c2058 km), respec-\ntively. In the same format, Fig. 7c shows the pair of flank\npasses on 8 May 2004 and 4 December 2003. In each of\nthe plots in Fig. 7, the top four panels are residuals (data-\nmodel) of magnetic field in GSM coordinates and the fifth\npanel shows the magnetic field magnitude from the 4 Clus-\nter spacecraft for the two orbits. In addition, at the bottom\nof each plot, the normal components of the residuals aver-\naged over the 4 Cluster spacecraft are shown. These are the\nprojections of dBavg and BEO\u2212avg onto the normal direction\nof the current tubes for each FAC: dBNavg = dBavg \u2022 n\u02c6v and\nBEO\u2212Navg =BEO\u2212avg \u2022 n\u02c6v . In BEO\u2212Navg, the bipolar signa-\nture is attributed to a current tube crossing by the spacecraft,\nwhile in dBNavg, it is due to the contributions of the un-\nderestimated part of the observed current tube. This means\nthe model performs better when the offset is larger between\ndBNavg and BEO\u2212Navg. The x-axis in these lower panels is\ntime relative to the perigee for each orbit.\nFrom Fig. 7, we find all four spacecraft observed the same\nsignatures when they were at small separation and observed\nsimilar signatures, successively with small differences, when\nthey were at large separation. The bipolar signatures, which\nare thought to be the contributions from region 2 FACs, are\nclearly shown in the residuals from all the four spacecraft, the\ndifferences between the spacecraft to spacecraft give an indi-\ncation of FAC spatial extent. In Fig. 7a there are also some\ncomplicated structures between +1.8 and +2.8 h of perigee in\nthe February 2007 pass (about three hours earlier than the one\nin February 2004). This may suggest the Cluster spacecraft\nare crossing the cusp current system at mid to high altitudes.\nSince all four spacecraft typically sample the region 2\nFACs, we may apply four-spacecraft timing analysis (Rus-\nsell et al., 1983; Dunlop and Woodward, 1998) to calculate\nthe motion and scale of the FACs observed by Cluster, us-\ning the known tetrahedral spacecraft configuration. The re-\nsults are given in Table 2, which are similar in each case and\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/309\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 309\u2013326, 2010\n322 Q.-H.

Zhang et al.: Comparison of magnetic field data from Cluster with Tsyganenko models\nThe timing analysis is calculated relative to the spacecraft\nmotion during the crossing of the structure. The FAC speeds,\n|V| in Table 2, range from about 0.22 km\/s to 1.42 km\/s, sug-\ngesting that the structures are very stable and are almost sta-\ntionary during the Cluster crossings. Assuming a cylindrical\ncurrent tube we can estimate the maximum current tube size\n(transverse thickness), DFAC using DFAC = |V | \u00b71t where\n1t is the duration of the whole bipolar signature surround-\ning each FAC. DFAC ranges (see Table 2) from about 0.17\nto 0.54RE for the region 2 FACs, and from about 0.06 to\n0.12 RE for the cusp FACs. We project the average residuals\nof dBavg and BEO\u2212avg(defined earlier) from the 4 spacecraft\nonto the relative normal directions n\u02c6v for these FACs. The\nresults show clear bipolar structures (see the lower panels in\nFig. 7a, b and c) with a peak-to-peak magnitude of \u223c50 and\n\u223c70 nT for the FACs on 13 February 2004, and of \u223c20 and\n\u223c25 nT for the FACs on 12 February 2007. This also sug-\ngests the residuals are much weaker in the later years.\n5 Discussion\nThe comparisons of eight years of magnetic field data from\nthe 4 Cluster spacecraft with the predictions from Tsyga-\nnenko models confirm the frequent occurrence of sharp,\nbipolar features in the residual values (data minus model) in\nall three GSM magnetic field components, which were at-\ntributed to region 2 FAC by Woodfield et al. (2007). These\nbipolar signatures place the observed FACs on or near the\nboundary of the ring current. The morphology of the Birke-\nland current system suggested by Iijima and Potemra (1976)\ncloses the region 2 system via the ring current; the ring cur-\nrent can extend from \u221265 to 65\u25e6 in latitude all over the\nevening and the post-midnight sector (Vallat et al., 2005).\nIt is therefore possible that the FACs we have observed were\nindeed part of the region 2 current circuit (Woodfield et al.,\n2007), or the region 2 FACs located at the boundary of the\nring current. This is in agreement with Vallat et al. (2005)\nwhere the authors used the four Cluster spacecraft to esti-\nmate the current using the curlometer technique (e.g. Dunlop\net al., 2002). A curlometer analysis has not been included\nhere since the quality is expected to be low in view of the\nspacecraft configuration in some of the relevant regions in\nthese orbits. Nevertheless, such a study is being attempted\nthrough improvements to the curlometer technique.\nThe quasi-static model (T89) takes into account the tail\ncurrent, ring current and Chapman-Ferraro currents, but does\nnot include the larger scale region 1 and 2 FAC. The dynamic\nmodels (T96 and T01) take a detailed approach to modelling\nthe region 1 and 2 Birkeland currents, including the change\nof ionospheric latitude with activity, dipole tilt-related defor-\nmation and the observed day-night asymmetry (Tsyganenko,\n1996, 2002a). It is a difficult task to model these FAC sys-\ntems realistically, however, and any attempt to include them\nin a global model is almost certain to be a simplification as\na matter of necessity. In general, we find that T96 and T01\nmodel the location of the observed FAC system signatures\nwell but the magnitude and fine structure are less well repro-\nduced, as there are additional filamentary structures embed-\nded within each FAC. It is unrealistic to expect the model\nto be able to estimate accurately the detailed structure. It is\nof prime concern, however, to obtain a realistic prediction of\nthe magnitude of the effect the FAC system has on the mag-\nnetic field. As the individual events showed, the intensity of\nthe magnetic field perturbation due to the FAC system varies\ngreatly. This increases the need for accurate and large data\nsets to be used in generating a model. The results presented\nhere demonstrate the need for empirical models of the ex-\nternal field to better exploit Cluster magnetic field measure-\nments, especially in the Birkeland current region.\nThe time that the FACs are encountered with respect to\nperigee alters over the course of a year as the plane of the\nCluster orbit precesses through 24 h in local time (see Wood-\nfield et al., 2007, Fig. 13). It would be expected, given\nthe day-night asymmetry mentioned above, that orbits with\na dayside perigee would observe any region 2 current sig-\nnatures further towards the poles (see, for example, Tsyga-\nnenko (2002a), Fig. 4). This is in agreement with our re-\nsults; the FAC signatures occur further away from perigee\nfrom about July to December.\nThe separations of the 4 Cluster spacecraft vary over the\nmission from about 100 km to 2\u20133RE, which allows us to\nmake spatial comparisons during similar external conditions.\nAt small separations, all the spacecraft observed the same\nfeatures with clear bipolar signatures resulting from the re-\ngion 2 FACs (see Fig. 7). The 4-spacecraft technique (timing\nanalysis) works very well for calculating the normal direction\nand scale of these FACs and the results confirm the presence\nof FACs. The deviations in the normal directions show a pos-\nitive to negative bipolar signature at the pre-perigee cross-\ning and a negative to positive bipolar signature, with some\nturbulence at the end, during the post-perigee crossing (see\nthe bottom panels in Fig. 7). This indicates that the Cluster\nspacecraft array is crossing one or two poleward FACs in the\npre-midnight, post-noon and dusk sectors, and tailward FACs\nin the dawn sector, which confirms the statistical distribu-\ntion of region 2 FACs above the polar region in the Northern\nHemisphere (Iijima and Potemra, 1976). We intend to im-\nprove the curlometer technique to calculate the current accu-\nrately for confirmation and investigation of the distributions\nof the region 2 FACs at the altitude of 4\u20135RE in the future.\nAt large separations, all four spacecraft observed similar\nsignatures one by one with few differences other than those\ndue to convection of the FACs in time. The large separations\nand the abnormal tetrahedral configuration of the Cluster\nspacecraft array may reduce the validity of the 4-spacecraft\ntechnique. Nevertheless, the similar bipolar signatures ob-\nserved one-by-one by the 4 Cluster spacecraft also suggest\nthat the region 2 FACs are very stable and are almost sta-\ntionary during the Cluster array crossing, which indicates\nAnn.

Zhang et al.: Comparison of magnetic field data from Cluster with Tsyganenko models 325\nthe timing analysis should work well under these conditions.\nFor example, the results from timing analysis confirm the\nFACs referred to in Sect. 4.2 for the events on 12 Febru-\nary 2007, when the average large separation between the 4\nCluster spacecraft is about 1600 km. The deviations in the\nnormal direction in this case also show a positive to nega-\ntive bipolar signature at the pre-perigee crossing (see the left\npanel of the right part of Fig. 7a), and a less common nega-\ntive to positive bipolar signature at the post-perigee crossing\n(see the right panel of the right part of Fig. 7a), which also\nindicate the Cluster spacecraft array might be crossing one\nor two poleward FACs in the pre-midnight sector. We find\nthat the variations in the average BEO\u2212Navg are much larger\nthan those in the average dBNavg. This might be because T01\noverestimates these FACs during quiet IMF conditions. Sim-\nilar features can also be found in the residuals for the later\nyears, resulting from the quiet external conditions during the\nyears near solar minimum.\n6 Conclusion\nAn investigation comparing eight years of magnetic field\ndata from the 4 Cluster spacecraft with Tsyganenko 1989\n(T89), 1996 (T96), and 2001 (T01) field models, while Clus-\nter passes through, or adjacent to, the equatorial ring cur-\nrent, has been carried out which significantly extends that of\nWoodfield et al. (2007), both with different orbit locations\nand model versions. There are some differences in the com-\nparisons of the data with the different models and with dif-\nferent spacecraft, and as a result of the changing magneto-\nspheric location (due to the progressive dropping southward\nof the Cluster orbit). During the Cluster ring current crossing\n(through perigee, at 4\u20135RE), the T01 and T89 models under-\nestimate the ring current, while T96 overestimates it. This\nstudy confirms that the deviations between the data and the\nmodel take two forms: a sharp, bipolar signature and well-\ndefined trends over a larger spatial region; these residuals can\nreach \u223c70 nT near perigee. We have shown here that these\ndeviations are much weaker during the years close to the\nsolar minimum, when geomagnetic activity is weaker. The\nsharp bipolar signatures are suggested to be Cluster cross-\nings of the region 2 FACs or low-altitude cusp FACs, depend-\ning on dayside or nightside orientation. For Cluster region 2\ncrossings, only T96 and T01 include the region 2 FACs in the\nmodel structure and T01 performs better. Overall, the resid-\nuals from T01 are much smaller than from the other models\nfor all of the magnetic field components, indicating that this\nmodel achieves the best fit to the data.\nThe four Cluster spacecraft observe nearly the same signa-\ntures at the small separations characteristic of the early years\nof the mission, but do sample different signatures at the large\nseparations during the later years, allowing comparisons to\nbe made during similar external conditions. Using the four-\nspacecraft technique, we find that the region 2 FACs, with a\nsize of\u223c0.17\u20130.54RE, and cusp FACs, with a size of\u223c0.06\u2013\n0.12RE, are very stable and are almost stationary during the\nCluster array crossings.\nIn future, we hope to better map the magnetospheric re-\nsponse in this region generally, and to study the quiet and\nstorm time ionospheric current systems linked via the re-\ngion 2 FAC.\nAcknowledgements.
