Confirmation of\nthe high velocity outflow is important since the mechanical\nenergy in the flow, if not highly collimated, is a significant\nfraction of the bolometric luminosity of PG1211+143 and\ncould be typical of AGN accreting near the Eddington rate\n(King and Pounds 2003), while also providing an example\nof the feedback required by the linked growth of SMBH in\nAGN with their host galaxy (King 2005). Subsequently, the\nsame XMM-Newton observation of PG1211+143 has been\nused by Gierlinski and Done (2004) to suggest how strong\nabsorption of the intrinsic X-ray continuum in a \u2018velocity-\nsmeared\u2019, high column, of moderately ionised gas can pro-\nvide a physically preferred explanation (to Comptonisation)\nfor the strong soft excess widely seen in type 1 AGN (Wilkes\nand Elvis 1987, Turner and Pounds 1989). A similar study\nby Chevallier et al. (2006), which also considered an ionised\nreflection origin of the soft excess, concluded that absorp-\ntion was the more likely cause of a strong soft excess (as in\nPG1211+143).\nIn the present paper we re-examine the XMM-Newton\nEPIC data of PG1211+143 which formed the strongest ev-\nidence for the high velocity claimed in P03. We use the\nlatest calibration files and - in particular - take advantage\nof the higher spectral energy resolution of the MOS cam-\neras demonstrated in recent studies of the Type 2 Seyferts\nMkn3 (Pounds and Page 2005) and NGC1068 (Pounds and\nVaughan 2006).\nWe assume a redshift for PG1211+143 of z = 0.0809\n(Marziani et al. 1996).\n2 OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION\nPG1211+143 was observed by XMM-Newton on 2001 June\n15 for \u223c53 ks. In this paper we concentrate on data from the\nEPIC pn (Stru\u00a8der et al.2001) and MOS (Turner et al.2001)\ncameras, which were deployed in large and small window\nmode, respectively, both with the medium filter. All X-ray\ndata were first screened with the XMM SAS v6.5 software\nand events corresponding to patterns 0-4 (single and dou-\nble pixel events) selected for the pn camera and patterns 0-\n12 for the MOS1 and MOS2 cameras. We extracted source\ncounts within a circular region of 45\u2032\u2032 radius defined around\nthe centroid position of PG1211+143, with the background\nbeing taken from a similar region, offset from but close to\nthe source. After removal of data during periods of high\nbackground the effective pn exposure was \u223c49.5 ks while\nthe MOS cameras were combined to give a single-camera-\nequivalent exposure of \u223c107 ks. Individual spectra were\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS\n2 K.A.Pounds et al.\nbinned to a minimum of 20 counts per bin, to facilitate use\nof the \u03c72 minimalisation technique in spectral fitting.\nSpectral fitting was based on the Xspec package (Ar-\nnaud 1996), version 11.3. All spectral fits include absorp-\ntion due to the line-of-sight Galactic column of NH =\n2.85\u00d71020cm\u22122 (Murphy et al. 1996) and errors are quoted\nat the 90% confidence level (\u2206\u03c72 = 2.7 for one interesting\nparameter).\n3 ABSORPTION LINES IN THE EPIC DATA\nFigure 1 reproduces the ratio plot of pn data to a simple\npower law fit (photon index of \u0393\u223c1.78) over the 1\u201310 keV\nband, as modelled in P03. Marked on the figure are 3 statis-\ntically significant \u2018narrow\u2019 absorption lines, with their iden-\ntification as proposed in P03, where they formed a key part\nof the case for a high velocity outflow. Denoted by an as-\nterix in figure 1 is a further \u2018absorption line\u2019 at \u223c1.8 keV,\nwhich was not included in the P03 analysis due to prevailing\nuncertainties in the detector calibration near the neutral Si\nedge. Repeating the analysis in P03 by successively adding\ngaussian lines to the power law model in Xspec the observed\nabsorption lines can be quantified. Fitting first the strongest\nline at \u223c7 keV improves the fit by \u2206 \u03c72 of 69 for 3 fewer\ndegrees of freedom, with a line energy of 7.07\u00b10.03 keV (ob-\nserver frame), width \u03c3=168\u00b146 eV and flux -5.7\u00b10.9 \u00d710\u22126\nph cm\u22122 s\u22121, corresponding to an equivalent width against\nthe power law continuum of \u223c210\u00b135 eV. Fitting additional\ngaussians to the weaker spectral features at \u223c2.7 and \u223c1.5\nkeV, with line width fixed at \u03c3=50 eV, gives further signif-\nicant improvements to the fit, with \u2206\u03c72 of 17 and 16, re-\nspectively, each for 2 additional degrees of freedom. The best\nfit line energies, again in the observer frame, are 2.7\u00b10.03\nand 1.47\u00b10.02 keV, with respective fluxes of -4.5\u00d710\u22126 ph\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 and -5.7\u00d710\u22126 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 (EWs of \u223c30eV and\n\u223c14eV, accurate to a factor \u223c2). Identifying the 3 absorp-\ntion lines with the resonance Ly\u03b1 transitions of FeXXVI,\nSXVI and MgXII then yields the mean outflow velocity of\n\u223c0.09\u00b10.01c reported in P03.\n3.1 Examining the higher resolution MOS\nspectrum\nAs noted in P03, the outflow velocity of \u223c0.09c is conser-\nvative in that identifying the \u223c7 keV feature with Fe XXV\nHe\u03b1, rather than FeXXVI Ly\u03b1, would require a larger en-\nergy shift and correspondingly higher velocity. Encouraged\nby the impressive low energy spectra from the (higher res-\nolution) MOS cameras, demonstrated in two recent studies\nof the Seyfert 2 galaxies Mkn3 (Pounds and Page 2005) and\nNGC1068 (Pounds and Vaughan 2006) we have re-examined\nthe spectral structure in the XMM-Newton observation of\nPG1211+143, concentrating on the MOS data. Our aim was\nto clarify the spectral structure at medium and low energies\nin the hope of removing the ambiguity in identifying the \u223c7\nkeV absorption line, and hence improving confidence in the\ndeduced outflow velocity.\nWith the higher energy resolution of the MOS camera\nthe absorption features at \u223c1.47 keV and \u223c2.71 keV now\nboth appear as a resolved line pair, with the energy spacing\nof the respective He\u03b1 and Ly\u03b1 resonance lines of Mg and\nFigure 1. EPIC pn camera data from the observation of\nPG1211+143 in 2001 compared with a simple power law fit over\nthe energy band 1-10 keV. Three narrow spectral features in the\n2001 data and their proposed identification in P03 with absorp-\ntion lines of highly ionised Mg, S and Fe are indicated. A further\nsignificant \u2018absorption line\u2019, marked by an asterix, lies close to\nthe neutral Si absorption edge and was therefore ignored in P03\nFigure 2. EPIC MOS camera data from the observation of\nPG1211+143 in 2001 compared with a simple power law fit over\nthe energy band 1-10 keV. Narrow spectral features and their\nproposed identification with K-shell absorption lines of Ne, Mg,\nSi, S, (Ar?) and Fe are indicated\nS. Furthermore, additional narrow absorption features are\nseen to match with same K-shell resonance lines of Ne, Si\nand possibly Ar.\nTo quantify these absorption features we explored the\nMOS data with Xspec. We first fitted the MOS data at\n1-5 keV with a power law to provide a baseline; below 1\nkeV the spectrum rises steeply due to strong soft X-ray\nemission (Pounds and Reeves 2006). Several narrow fea-\ntures clearly visible in the data-to-power-law-model ratio\nplot (figure 3, upper panel) contributed to a poor statistical\nfit (\u03c72=351\/266). Fitting gaussians to the visible features,\nwith a fixed width of \u03c3= 10eV, found 6 significant negative\n(absorption) lines. The overall improvement to the fit was\nvery significant with \u03c72 reduced to 270\/254. The fitted line\nenergies and fluxes are listed in Table 1 where the observed\nline energy is in each case compared with the most likely\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\nHigh velocity outflow of PG1211+143 3\nTable 1.

Crucially, all 6 line energies exhibit a \u2018blue\nshift\u2019 in the range \u223c5-7 %. Assuming the same ratio for the\nabsorption line observed at \u223c7.07 keV gives a preferred iden-\ntification with He\u03b1 of FeXXV (figure 2). In the rest frame\nof PG1211+143 the revised identification of the absorption\nspectrum now yields an increased outflow velocity in the\nrange v\u223c0.13-0.15c.\n4 COMPARISON WITH AN IONISED\nOUTFLOW\nTo test the compatibility of the visual absorption line set\nwith a physical absorber we then compared the MOS data\nwith a photoionised gas modelled using the XSTAR code\n(Kallman et al 1996). Free parameters of the absorber in\nthis comparison were the column density and ionisation pa-\nrameter, with outflow (or inflow) velocities included as an\nadjustment to the apparent redshift of the absorbing gas.\nAll relevant abundant elements from Ne to Fe were included\nwith the relative abundances constrained to within a factor\n2 of solar.\nSince our primary aim was to check the energies and\nrelative strength of the principal absorption lines identified\nin the visual spectral fit shown in figure 2, the model did\nnot attempt to match the broad excess flux near \u223c6 keV;\nit therefore consisted only of a power law with photoionised\nabsorber. Fitting over the 1-10 keV band the addition of the\nphotoionised absorber improved the spectral fit from \u03c72 of\n522 for 358 degrees of freedom to 465\/345. The best-fit col-\numn density was NH\u223c2\u00d710\n22 cm\u22122, with an ionisation pa-\nrameter of log\u03be=2.9\u00b10.4 and nominal relative abundances\nof Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar and Fe of 0.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.5 and 0.5.\nFigure 3 (mid panel) reproduces this absorbed power law\nmodel, with the strongest predicted absorption lines (in or-\nder of increasing energy) corresponding to K-shell resonance\ntransitions of Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar and Fe, supporting the visual\nassessment of figure 2. Additionally, we note the Ly\u03b2 line of\nMgXII would occur at \u223c1.83 keV, suggesting much of the\nobserved deficit at that energy may be real (and that our\nMOS calibration models the neutral Si edge rather well).\nTo clarify the comparison with the MOS data in the\nlower energy band, the upper panel of figure 3 illustrates the\nphotoionised absorber with the Fe abundance set to zero.\nRemoving Fe from the absorber also shows that potential\nconfusion from Fe-L absorption is limited above \u223c1.2 keV.\nThe apparent redshift read from the XSTAR model was (-\n4.9\u00b10.3) x 10\u22122, corresponding to an outflow velocity (in the\nrest frame of PG1211+143) of v\u223c0.130\u00b10.003c. While this\nvalue is consistent with the range of velocities of 0.13-0.15c\ndeduced from the individual line fitting in Xspec, the implied\nprecision is probably not justified given the simplicity of the\nsingle absorber XSTAR model.\nAlthough the addition of a lower ionisation absorber\nwould improve the match to the observed line ratios, in par-\nticular in providing stronger absorption for He-like Mg and\nNe, we have not included a second absorber in the model,\nhaving already achieved our objective of modelling a high\nvelocity outflow across multiple ions. However, it is interest-\ning to note that the addition of a lower ionisation component\nwould also enhance the \u2018red wing\u2019 to the Fe K absorption,\nalready showing up in the XSTAR plot in figure 3 (mid\npanel), due to increased contributions from ions of FeXX-\nXXIV, and thereby explain the apparently resolved \u223c7 keV\nabsorption line (\u03c3=168\u00b146 eV) in the pn spectrum.\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\n4 K.A.Pounds et al.\nFigure 4. (top) Photoionised absorber model as described in the\ntext, with principal absorption lines, in order of increasing energy,\nof Ne, Mg, Si, S and Ar, but with no Fe; (middle) photoionised\nabsorber as above but with Fe now included; (bottom) repeat of\nthe data-to-power law model ratio shown in figure 2;\nIn summary, modelling the MOS absorption spectrum\nwith a photoionised absorber shows it to be physically com-\npatible with a highly ionised outflow of velocity in the range\n0.13-0.15c, as derived from individual line fitting.\n4.1 A revised mass rate and energy in the high\nvelocity flow\nIn their previous analysis of the PG1211+143 absorption\nline spectrum P03 showed that, provided the high velocity\noutflow was not tightly collimated, then the mass loss rate\nand mechanical energy in the flow would be comparable to\nthe mass accretion rate and \u223c10 % of the bolometric lumi-\nnosity. We can now re-estimate those quantities. In doing\nso we use an estimate of 7% for the covering factor of the\nfast outflow, calculated by comparing the absorbed and re-\nemitted power in the highly ionised gas derived from a broad\nband fit to the full 0.3-10.0 keV spectrum of PG1211+143\n(Pounds and Reeves 2006).\nAssuming a radial flow, the outflow mass rate is then\nM\u02d9out = 0.3pi.nr\n2.v.mp \u223c0.2pi.Lion\/\u03be.v.mp where n is the par-\nticle density at a radius r, and Lion\u223c 10\n44 erg s\u22121 is the\nionising luminosity. With the observed ionisation parameter\nlog\u03be\u223c3, we find M\u02d9out \u223c2.5\u00d7 10\n26 gm s\u22121 (\u223c3.5 M\u2299 yr\n\u22121).\nThe corresponding mechanical energy in the fast, highly\nionised outflow is then \u223c2 \u00d7 1045 erg s\u22121, compared with\nan estimated bolometric luminosity for PG1211+143 of\n\u223c5\u00d71045 erg s\u22121. We note this ratio is a factor \u223c3 higher\nthan the ratio v\/c expected from a radiation driven wind\n(King and Pounds 2003). However, given the undoubted sim-\nplification of our single-absorber model, and uncertainties in\nderivation of the covering factor, it is probably premature\nto adopt the popular appeal to magnetic forces to drive the\noutflow!\n5 HOW COMMON ARE ENERGETIC, HIGH\nVELOCITY FLOWS?\nThe Black Hole Winds model of King and Pounds (2003)\nprovided a simple physical basis whereby massive, high\nvelocity outflows can be expected in AGN accreting\nnear the Eddington limit. A simultaneous observation of\nPG1211+143 in 2001 with the XMM-Newton Optical Mon-\nitor (Mason et al. 2001) showed the energetically dominant\nBBB to be at a typical value, indicating a bolometric lumi-\nnosity of \u223c5\u00d71045 erg s\u22121. With a reverberation mass esti-\nmate for the SMBH in PG1211+143 of M \u223c 4 \u00d7 107 M\u2299\n(Kaspi et al. 2000) that luminosity suggests accretion in\nPG1211+143 is indeed near the Eddington rate, a conclu-\nsion consistent with the optical description of PG1211+143\nas a Narrow Line QSO (Boroson and Green 1992, Kaspi et\nal. 2000), given that a high accretion ratio has been causally\nlinked with Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (eg Pounds and\nVaughan 2000 and references therein). It may well be that\nenergetic outflows are a signature of Eddington-limited ac-\ncretion in AGN. This might be the case for the bright\nSeyfert 1 IC4329A, which Markowitz et al.(2006) have re-\ncently shown to exhibit a strongly blue-shifted Fe K absorp-\ntion line indicating a highly ionised outflow at v\u223c0.1c. While\nrelatively rare in the local universe such X-ray spectra could\nbe common for luminous, higher redshift AGN.\n6 SUMMARY\n(1) A previous analysis of the 2001 XMM-Newton observa-\ntion of the bright quasar PG1211+143 reported evidence\nof a high velocity ionised outflow, with a mass and kinetic\nenergy comparable to the accretion mass and bolometric lu-\nminosity, respectively (P03).\n(2) This finding is now confirmed, with the previous\nuncertainty in the derived velocity removed by securing the\nidentification of the main observed absorption lines.\n(4) We suggest that fast, energetic outflows may be a\ntypical signature of type 1 AGN accreting at or close to the\nEddington limit.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe results reported here are based on observations obtained\nwith XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instru-\nc\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u2013??\nHigh velocity outflow of PG1211+143 5\nments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member\nStates and the USA (NASA).
