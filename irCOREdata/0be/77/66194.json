The great majority of users of mental \nhealth services who had severe and enduring mental illness were living with family carers or \nby themselves \u2018in the community\u2019.  The policy has however proved controversial.  The 1998 \ngovernment White Paper Modernising Mental Health Services: Safe, Sound and Supportive \n(Department of Health, 1998a) emphasised that whilst care in the community had benefited \nmany, there had also been too many failures. These were attributed to the poor management \nof resources, underfunding, the overburdening of families, service users losing contact with \nservices and problems in recruiting and retaining staff.  The government stated that a modern \nmental service should: \n\u201c\u2026provide care which is integrated, and which is focused on the individual, \nrecognising that different people have different needs and preferences.  It will be \nevidence-based and outcome driven.\u201d  (p.21) \nThe means of achieving this goal were set out in the National Service Framework for Mental \nHealth (NSF) (Department of Health, 1999) which established a template for mental health \nservices.  It introduced new models of services and reinforced the principles of \ninterprofessional care: \n 5\n\u201cSuch a comprehensive programme of change cannot be achieved by a single agency or \na single profession working in isolation.  One of the defining characteristics of mental \nhealth services is the range of disciplines who frequently need to be involved in the care \nplan of a single individual; suitable accommodation, adequate income, meaningful \noccupation and family support all play a part alongside competent diagnosis, treatment \nand care.\u201d (Department of Health 2001a p7) \nThe NSF further specified that all education and training should be evidence-based, stress the \nvalue of multidisciplinary team working and involve service users in its evaluation \n(Department of Health, 1999, p109).   \nThe Birmingham Programme in Community Mental Health \nThe Birmingham programme was one of a number established to provide postgraduate level \neducation to staff working in mental health services (Brooker et al., 2002).  It was \nnevertheless distinctive because of its strong emphasis on interprofessional learning and on \npartnership with service users.  It had three key objectives: \n\u2022 To train staff in the use of a range of evidence-based psychosocial interventions \nwith people with severe and enduring mental health problems \n\u2022 To improve understanding of, and skills in, interprofessional working \n\u2022 To increase awareness of the need to work from a service user\u2019s perspective. \nThe curriculum comprised modules including user participation and self-help, assessment, \ninterprofessional working in community teams, interagency collaboration, and psychosocial \ninventions (PSI) such as cognitive behaviour therapy and family therapy.  These were \nassessed by assignments based on practice and work-based activities such as community \nassessments, analytical case studies and audiotapes of therapeutic interventions.  \n 6\nAccording to Barr\u2019s  (1996) classification of interprofessional education, the Birmingham \nprogramme was explicit in its focus on learning to promote collaboration.  It was integrated \ninto multiprofessional education as a distinct emphasis reflected in the design, content and \nlearning methods.  Explicit interprofessional education however comprised only part of the \nprogramme  which also emphasised learning about psychosocial interventions and user \nparticipation.  It was of course particular in its concern for people with severe mental health \nproblems.   The learning methods and assessments were generally individual rather than \ncollective.  Although all participants were working in mental health services, the teaching \nprogramme was college-based, but with work-based assignments.    It was a long course, \nlasting one day a week for two academic years and at a later stage of education; participants \nhad been qualified practitioners for at least two years.   The curriculum contained both \ncommon elements, such as learning about PSIs and comparative study of respective roles and \nresponsibilities and perspectives to inform interprofessional practice. It contained both \ninteractive and didactic learning methods.  \nWe have previously presented in this journal a detailed qualitative study of efforts to \ninvolving service users in every aspect of the programme (Barnes et al, 2000a); an update is \nin preparation. \nThe programme took a multidisciplinary approach to course management, co-ordination and \nteaching.  It recruited a multidisciplinary intake of mental health professionals from \npsychiatric nursing, social work, occupational therapy and, to a lesser extent, psychology and \npsychiatry, as well as workers from the voluntary sector and service users.  In a previous \npaper we reported that there was considerable evidence of professional stereotyping by \nparticipants on the programme, but little evidence of change (Barnes et al., 2000b); a further \nreport is forthcoming. \n 7\nIn this paper we first present an overview of the evaluation methodology.  We then describe \nthe methods used to determine the impacts of the programme on students\u2019 learning, its \nimplementation in the workplace and, finally, the outcomes for service users with whom the \nstudents worked. \n Design and Methods \nThe West Midlands region of the NHS Executive, which had funded the programme itself, \ncommissioned the independent external evaluation.  This was required to inform the \ndevelopment of the programme throughout the five year contract period and to contribute to \nknowledge of the outcomes of interprofessional education in mental health, including the \noutcomes for service users. \nThe external evaluation team adopted as a core principle working in partnership with \nstakeholders.  This was expressed in terms of developing a constructive working relationship \nwith the programme staff and students so that they could feel empowered rather than \noppressed by the evaluation.  The evaluation was formative as well as summative, giving \nregular feedback to the programme itself and to an evaluation steering group comprising the \ncommissioners, service user representatives and senior agency staff as well as independent \nacademics.  A key feature of the partnership approach was the participation of service users \ndescribed in Barnes et al., (2000a). \nIn order to structure a comprehensive evaluation of the programme we used Kirkpatrick\u2019s \n(1967) well-known framework, as expanded by Barr and his colleagues (1999). We employed \na wide range of qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the process and outcomes \nof the programme, including the implementation of learning in practice.  These included \nstructured individual and group interviews, questionnaires with standardised measures and \nparticipant observation.  The methods are presented in relation to the Kirkpatrick\/Barr \nframework in Fig. 1.   \n 8\n                                                \nFigure 1 about here \nQuestionnaire data were collected from course participants at three time points: on the first \nmorning of the programme (T1) and at the end of the first and second years (T2 and T3 \nrespectively) as indicated.  Members of the research team conducted group and individual \ninterviews at the university at T2 and T3, and in students\u2019 workplaces at various times as part \nof a programme of team visits.  During these visits, team colleagues also completed the \nquestionnaire measures of attitudes and team functioning; this provided a comparison group \nfor cross-sectional analysis. \nWe developed a \u2018core competency\u2019 measure based on the capability framework for mental \nhealth practitioners (Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2001 p8) in order to assess changes \nin students\u2019 perceptions of their knowledge and skills.  Using a 10-point rating scale, students \nwere asked to rate the importance of each of the core competencies and to assess their own \nlevels of skill and knowledge at the beginning (T1) and end of the programme (T3).  This \nmeasure covered a number of areas including partnership working with service users; \nmultidisciplinary working; and psychosocial interventions. \nIn order to evaluate outcomes for service users, we selected at random from the students\u2019 \ncaseloads a number of service users with whom they intended to practice the methods and \napproaches which they were learning on the course.  As part of the curriculum, students were \ntrained by members of the research team in the use of standardised measures of mental health \nand quality of life (Fig. 1).  They were required, as part of the course academic assessment, to \ncomplete an assessment of the chosen service user at two time points six months apart1.  The \ntime period and the measures chosen were the same as for a concurrent study of the outcomes \nof community mental health services in the North of England.  This study provided a useful \n \n1 The West Midlands Region Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee approved the \nprocedures for this component of the evaluation, including informed consent and \nconfidentiality.  Service users who declined to participate were replaced by others randomly \nselected from caseloads in the same way. Further details of procedures and measures are \ngiven in Carpenter et al. (2003). \n 9\nnon-intervention comparison group because the equivalent staff in the study districts had not \nreceived any postqualifying interprofessional education in mental health. Consequently, any \ndifferences in outcomes for users in these districts and those served by students could be \nattributed to the effects of the programme. \nIn addition, we sought users\u2019 views of the outcomes of training using a 16-item, 4-point \nrating scale especially designed for this evaluation (Barnes et al., 2000a).  This assessed what \nusers considered to be important outcomes of postqualifying education, such as: the user\u2019s \nprofessional relationship with the trainee; the extent to which the user felt involved in their \nown care and treatment; the quality of the information and advice given; and whether they \nworked effectively with other agencies.   Users were offered the choice of not participating, \nparticipating by returning the questionnaire anonymously by post, a telephone interview, \nbeing interviewed by a trained user-researcher or by a member of the evaluation team. \nData Analysis \nThe reliability of scales were assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha and the theta co-efficient.  \nStatistical analyses undertaken employed both parametric and non-parametric approaches in \norder to estimate the robustness of the conclusions.  Methods used to detect differences over \ntime and between groups included parametric (t-test, ANOVA) and non-parametric (Mann-\nWhitney, Kruskal-Wallis) methods. In order to assess differences in outcomes between \ngroups of service users we employed Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with scores at time \n1 as a co-variate, enabling us to control statistically for differences in baseline scores (Dugard \nand Todman, 1995).  Scores on the 4-point service user satisfaction questionnaire were \ninvestigated using Chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact test.  \nQualitative data, including interview transcripts and field notes were analysed thematically \nusing NVIVO software (Searle, 2000).   \n 10\nFindings \nIt will already be apparent that we do not have space in this paper to give a detailed account \nof all the findings from this evaluation.  We shall provide only brief summaries of: students\u2019 \nreactions to the programme (Kirkpatrick\/Barr Level 1) and modifications in attitudes, \nincluding interprofessional stereotypes (Level 2a).  Detailed reports on these aspects of the \nprogramme are in preparation.  This report will focus primarily on changes in students\u2019 \nperceptions of their knowledge and skills (Level 2b), the extent to which they were able to \nimplement their learning (Level 3), changes in organisational practice (4a) and the outcomes \nfor service users (Level 4b).   \nFindings \nIt will already be apparent that we do not have space to give a detailed account of all the \nfindings from this evaluation.  We shall provide only brief summaries of: students\u2019 reactions \nto the programme (Kirkpatrick\/Barr Level 1) and modifications in attitudes, including \ninterprofessional stereotypes (Level 2a).  Detailed reports on these aspects of the programme \nand on user participation are in preparation.  Here we focus primarily on changes in students\u2019 \nperceptions of their knowledge and skills (Level 2b), the extent to which they were able to \nimplement their learning (Level 3), changes in organisational practice (4a) and the outcomes \nfor service users (Level 4b).   \nParticipants \nThe evaluation project commenced after the start of the first year of the programme in 1998 \nand therefore the first cohort of students (Co1) participated in the piloting of approaches and \nmeasures.  Data are presented for the following three cohorts for whom it was possible to \nobtain full returns over two years. \nParticipants were generally well-established professionals (mean length of time in present \nprofession < 5 years, range 1-29 years).  Over two thirds (69%) were women.  One in eight \n 11\nstudents designated themselves as black or South Asian.  The largest group of participants \nwas nurses (Table 1), mainly community psychiatric nurses, but including some staff from \nspecialist rehabilitation centres and others from acute in-patient wards.  There were similar \nproportions of social workers and occupational therapists (OTs), together comprising one \nquarter of the student group.  There were only two psychologists and one psychiatrist in these \ncohorts.  The programme also recruited a number of project workers and staff from the \nvoluntary sector without professional qualifications, and two declared service users.  Nearly \none in four (24%) of those who began the programme subsequently dropped out at or before \nthe end of the first year, without completing any qualification.  In addition, 15 students (10%) \nleft at the end of the first year with a postgraduate certificate.   \nTable 1 here \nThe dropouts and early finishers had an impact on the numbers of questionnaires returned at \nthe three time points (Table 2).  For Cohorts 3 and 4, there were a number of students who \njoined the programme after its start and were therefore unable to complete the measures at \nT1.  The statistical analyses reported below refer to the matched pairs for which we had \ncomplete data. \nTable 2 here \nThe comparison group of staff working in community mental health services who did not \ntake part in the course comprised 62 people, 43 (69%) women and 19 (31%) men.  Compared \nto programme participants, a significantly lower proportion described themselves as black or \nAsian (6%, p = 0.002).    \nLevel 1: Learners\u2019 reactions. \nStudents welcomed the chances to exchange ideas and experiences with colleagues from \nother disciplines and from other mental health services.  The multi-disciplinary make-up of \nthe programme was valued but there were regrets were that the disciplines of psychology and \n 12\npsychiatry were not more fully represented, restricting some work on interprofessional \naspects of mental health practice.  The taught programme was well appreciated by successive \ncohorts of students: the material was considered relevant and up-to-date and to have been \npresented effectively.  The emphases on evidence-based practice, values, and user \nperspectives were highlighted.  It was evident, however, that supervision arrangements were \nrather variable.  When these worked well, they were a very important factor in enabling \nstudents to apply their learning and to manage the demands of course and work, but not all \nstudents felt adequately supported in this respect. \nThere was strong evidence that students found the programme stressful.  The proportions of \nstudents scoring above the threshold on the GHQ-12 increased substantially from the \nbeginning of the course to the end of the first year (Fig. 2).  In Cohort 4, the proportion \nexperiencing stress at T1 was twice that of students in the previous two cohorts.  It was \nhowever similar to the proportion of team colleagues experiencing stress during the same \nyear, suggesting that other systemic factors such a services change were involved.  \nNevertheless, at T2, the proportion experiencing stress in this cohort had also increased \nsignificantly, to over 50%.  The increases in mean stress scores were statistically significant \n(p = 0.03) but there were no differences in change scores between cohorts, in other words, the \npattern was consistent.  Through interviews, students reported stress in three areas: the \nworkplace; with assignments; and at home; it was often a combination of these issues which \ncaused the greatest difficulties. \nFig 2 about here \nLevel 2 a: Changes in attitudes and values \nStudents from all disciplines generally began the course with positive attitudes towards the \nprinciples and values underpinning community mental health services, but they reported \nbenefits from having been required to reappraise their value base.  The most significant \n 13\nchanges reported were in their attitudes towards service users; students believed that this had \nmade important differences to the ways in which they approached their practice.    \nLearning on a multidisciplinary course appeared to have only a marginal effect on students\u2019 \nprofessional identification; they did not re-define themselves as generic \u2018mental health \nworkers\u2019 but retained an appreciation of professional differences. \nThere was considerable evidence of professional stereotyping but little evidence of change in \nthese stereotypes during the course.  Positive stereotypes were not strengthened appreciably, \nnor were negative stereotypes reduced.   Having examined possible reasons, we concluded \nfirst, that the students tended not to see fellow course members as \u2018typical\u2019 members of the \nother mental health professions and therefore did not generalise their positive experiences of \nfellow students to their professions as a whole.  We should also note that because there were \nso few psychiatrists and psychologists on the programme, there was little opportunity for \nstudents\u2019 negative stereotypes to be disconfirmed.   \nLevel 2b Changes in knowledge and skills  \nIn interviews, students reported greater confidence in their jobs, derived from evidence-based \nand up-to-date teaching across a range of topics.  Self-ratings on the \u2018core competency\u2019 \nmeasure indicated substantially increased knowledge and skills in the key areas of partnership \nwith users, psychosocial interventions and multidisciplinary teamworking.  In respect of the \nlatter, students gave very high ratings for its importance and indicated statistically significant \n(p< 0.001) and substantial increases in their knowledge of the core roles and tasks of other \nprofessions and of the principles and skills in multidisciplinary team working (Fig. 3). \nFigure 3 about here \nIn the area of psychosocial interventions, students were clear that they had not been trained to \nthe level of competence of a skilled practitioner of CBT or behavioural family therapy; the \nmodules were much too brief to enable this.   Rather, the modules were considered to have \nprovided a basic introduction; the students then required support and supervision in their \n 14\nwork places in applying their knowledge and skills. These views are summarised in the \ncompetency ratings (Fig. 4): students perceived PSIs to be very important and indicated \nstatistically significant gains in knowledge (p < 0.001), at the end of the taught programme \nthe median rating was just below 8 on the 10 point scale, indicating \u2018moderate\u2019 expertise.  \nFigure 4 about here \nLevel 3: Behavioural change \nThere was strong significant evidence from the self-report measure that the students\u2019 use of \nPSIs taught on the programme had increased over time.  On the scale (1 = \u201cnever\u201d to 5 = \n\u201cvery frequently\u201d) the mean rating for the use of CBT increased from 2.83 at T1 to 3.13 at T2 \n(p = 0.01) and to 3.59 at T3 (p = 0.004).  Similarly, reported use of family therapy increased \nfrom 2.53 at T1 to 3.83 (p = 0.04) at T2, to 3.46 (p = 0.001) at T3.  Nevertheless these ratings \nfor PSIs at T3 equated to mid way between \u201csometimes\u201d and \u201cfrequently\u201d on the scale and \nthese interventions were clearly used less frequently than the core tasks of assessment and \ncare planning, and care co-ordination (mean ratings at T3 = 4.37, 4.24 respectively).  We \nconsider students\u2019 ability to implement their learning about interprofessional working below, \nat the level of organisational change. \nThere was evidence that students experienced role conflict, defined in Rizzo et al.\u2019s (1970) \nmeasure as personal conflicts arising from competing demands, inadequate resources and \nincompatible requests (Fig. 5).  Students in general gave significantly higher ratings than \ntheir team colleagues  (p = 0.004) with nurses giving lower ratings on average than the other \nprofessions (p = 0.006).   At Time 2, there was a small but statistically significant overall \nincrease in role conflict (p = 0.01), most noticeably for students in Cohort 3.  This suggests \nthat the demands of the course on participants to change their practice and implement their \nlearning may have increased the difficulties in performing their roles.   \nFig 5 about here \n 15\nThe problem with role conflict was confirmed in interviews when students explained that the \nimplementation of their learning often challenged their traditional role in their team or \naspects of practice.  The lack of professional support could add to the conflicts, e.g.: \nConfidence levels have been very up and down on this course as I have struggled with \nrole conflict.  My ASW [approved social worker] role is in conflict with therapy.  From \nthe social services department I got no support, so this created serious difficulties. (Co2 \nY2 Group discussion 9) \nHowever, the challenges were not necessarily viewed negatively, many perceived conflict as \na sign of change, viz.: \nStudents claimed that, although they received a lot of support from some quarters, \noften from quite key people, there were other areas where they received none, either \nbecause people were not interested or were very against it.  The increase in role \nconflict they saw as a positive as it \u2018shows we are doing something\u2019.  (Cohort 2 T2, \nGroup discussion 2) \nLevel 4a: Change in organisational practice \nAnalysis of interview data showed that many students were able to make use of their learning \nand take a more assertive part in the multidisciplinary team, e.g.: \nI think the course has improved the way I work with other professionals.  I am able to \ndiscuss things with them much more confidently, especially with doctors.  I am now able \nto challenge them and throw research papers in to back myself up.  I also give advice \nand suggestions in dealing with service users.  The team are quite welcoming of \nsuggestions and they are very good with sharing information.  (CPN Interview 18) \nSome team colleagues noticed the change in approach brought to their team by students; \nthese teams seemed to be open to new ideas and to welcome their contributions.    \n 16\nAs a team we have always placed a lot of emphasis on not letting hierarchy get in the \nway\u2026.  We have always tried to break down barriers between professions.  I think \neverybody has been committed to that, but this is where the Programme has fed into the \nteam \u2013 where the value base departs from the medical model.  (Team interview 4) \nIn other teams, strongly held rigid beliefs about professional roles apparently prevented \nprogress towards more effective interprofessional working, e.g.: \nIt may be easy to forget what discipline someone is from on the course, but at work it is \nvery different as people have \u2018professional preciousness\u2019.  Comments are not always \nwelcome from you if the topic discussed is not considered to be an area in which your \nprofession holds expertise\u2026.  (Co2 T2 Group discussion 3) \nThis led some students to question the meaning of \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 in the context of teams.  \nThey questioned the number of representatives of a profession needed to make a \nmultidisciplinary team truly interprofessional and how minority professions can best protect \nthe positive characteristics of their profession without retaining single discipline teams. \nThere is a wider question about multidisciplinary working.  Is it multidisciplinary only \nhaving one OT in a team?  It is really difficult to battle against others who do not \nunderstand our approach, so it becomes generic.  Then why have an OT in the team \nanyway?  We are seen as a precious empire here [OT Department] who don\u2019t mix with \nothers.  Multidisciplinary working depends on attitude doesn\u2019t it? (Team interview 2) \nA few students felt powerless to bring about change in their teams.  In the first years, many \nstudents believed that if enough team members were to go on the Programme, then change \nmight be possible, but students in Cohort 4 still felt their lack of status and numbers were \nbarriers: \nIt was felt that the course was having little impact on teams but where there is an \nimpact, it had been due to a student.  There was a feeling that the teams that need to \n 17\nknow are the ones which do not want to know.  It was felt necessary to have a critical \nmass of students who have been on the course in teams. (Co1 T2 Group discussion 4) \nThe course has made me more aware of the roles of other professionals, but it has also \nbeen frustrating to see how multidisciplinary working can be compared to the reality.  \nThe system is too big for us to change.  (Co4 T1 Group discussion 1) \nThis range of views was generally supported by findings from the Team Climate Inventory \n(West and Anderson 1998).  Overall, ratings from both students and team colleagues were \nvery similar and indicated only moderate levels of team functioning in relation to scale \nnorms.   Average ratings did not change over the duration of the programme and there were \nno differences between students and team colleagues.  In other words, neither the wider \norganisational changes in mental health services, nor the students\u2019 learning about team \nfunctioning had any demonstrable effect on students\u2019 perceptions of team functioning. \nLevel 4b: Outcomes for service users \nParticipants \nService users in the two programme intervention (\u201ccohort\u201d) groups and the two non-\nintervention (\u201cdistrict\u201d) groups were similar in terms of average age and gender mix (Table \n3).  However, Cohort 4 contained a higher proportion of users from black and minority ethnic \ngroups compared to the other groups.  The programme groups also had higher proportions of \nusers with a diagnosed psychotic illness and this is reflected in the higher mean scores on the \nBrief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), which is sensitive to psychotic symptoms and in \nlower mean scores on the Life Skills Profile.  In addition, the summary measure (M3) of \nproblems, risks and psychiatric service use supports the view that the programme group users \nhad, in general, more severe mental health problems compared to the non-intervention \ngroups.  This observation of differences in baseline ratings confirms the appropriateness of \n 18\nemploying ANCOVA to detect differences between the intervention and non-intervention \ngroups.  But first we investigate changes over time in the intervention group alone. \nTable 3 about here \nFindings \nThere was evidence from the tests of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (Table 4) that users in \nboth the intervention groups had improved significantly over six months in terms of their \npsychiatric symptoms (as measured by the BPRS) and their general mental health (Health of \nthe Nation Outcome Scales). There was strong evidence of improvements in social \nfunctioning as measured by both the global indicator (GAS) and the Life Skills Profile (LSP) \nand in the service users\u2019 satisfaction with various aspects of their lives (Life Satisfaction \nScale, LSP).  There were no significant differences between the two intervention groups, \nindicating that users in both groups had, in general, improved to an equivalent extent.   \nANOVA with the two non-intervention groups (not shown here) indicated that these service \nusers had also improved in the above measures, albeit to a slightly lesser degree.  The \napplication of ANCOVA showed that the intervention groups retained a strongly statistically \nsignificant advantage in terms of life skills, but not for the other measures (Table 4). \nTable 4 about here \nOverall, responses to the user-defined questionnaire were quite positive.  Responses were \ncategorised as positive or negative (Table 5).  Almost all users believed that the students \ntreated them with respect and understood them and their experience of mental ill health.  For \nexample: \nShe makes one feel that what a person thinks matters.  (Student (S)1 Cohort (Co)3) \nMy worker understands me because she is trained to understand.  She understands me \nbecause she cares about me.  (S4 Co3) \n 19\nShe treats me as how I am -  as an individual and not an illness.  (S6 Co3) \nIn these respects, findings were very similar in the non-intervention groups. \nTable 5 about here \nUsers also considered that they had been encouraged to explain their problems and needs:   \nShe always listens carefully and does not just like the sound of her own voice.  (S11, \nCo2 ) \nOver three quarters stated that they had been involved in care planning as much as they \nwished.  This proportion compares quite favourably to users in the non-intervention districts.  \nOne programme group user commented: \nShe does encourage me, but at the same time I don\u2019t feel pushed, which is a good thing.   \n(S35 Co4 ) \nSignificantly higher proportions of users in the programme group gave positive or very \npositive responses about care planning compared to users in the comparison groups.  \nProgramme group users generally thought that the students could answer questions about \ntheir medication (a subject taught on the programme); proportions were significantly higher \ncompared to the non-intervention groups.   \nWith regard to multi-disciplinary working, around three-quarters of programme users \nconsidered that the student had worked with other agencies to ensure that their needs were \nmet.  One user explained:   \nIf I feel if I may need something she either knows or knows somebody who could advise \nme on that situation. (S23 Co3 ) \nThere was no statistically significant difference between the programme and comparison \ngroups in this respect, or in terms of consistency of information and advice from different \nprofessionals; over two-thirds reported consistent advice.  Similar proportions reported that \n 20\ntheir named worker checked that they had been able to get the help the user considered that \nthey needed from services.  Again, differences were not significant. \n \nFour out of five users believed that the students used their power appropriately and that they \nlet the user take sensible risks in meeting new challenges. \nShe has never used her power by being forceful.  She respects me. (S 23 Co4 ) \nIt is up to me the risks I take, but she will try and guide me the right way. (S12 Co3) \nIntervention group users were very significantly more likely to report being asked if they \nwanted their carers or family involved in care planning than comparators.  Only half believed \nthat the student had considered their cultural or religious needs and one in four did not. \nI am religious but we\u2019ve never discussed it. (S6 Co4) \nA few service users took the opportunity to explain how positively they felt towards the \nstudents as individuals and also about the specific help which they and their families had \nreceived.  For example, one user explained:  \nI feel like my named worker is the kind of person that I would like as a friend.  However, \nI know that it is not her job, but the fact that I can tell her anything and I am not judged.  \nShe brought me videos, which helped me and my parents to understand my illness, and \neven when I was unsure whether I was ill at all, told me I was, and until I began to feel \nbetter for longer periods of time I was unable to see this for myself.  She has been a \nlifeline for me and I am always pleased when she comes.  (S15 Co 4). \n \nDiscussion \nThis study, which examined the outcomes of the programme at all levels of the \nKirkpatrick\/Barr (Barr et al., 1999) framework for the evaluation of training, is the most \ncomprehensive evaluation of a postqualifying training programme in mental heath yet to be \n 21\nundertaken (Bailey et al., 2003).  It is also quite possibly the most comprehensive \nlongitudinal evaluation of any programme of interprofessional education to date.  It had a \nnumber of important additional characteristics.  First, unlike many other studies, it was \ncarried out by an independent external research team.  Second, it was conducted over five \nyears, tracking three cohorts of students through the full two years of the course, as well as \ninvestigating the outcomes for two successive groups of service users; it was thereby able to \nassess, and confirm, the consistency of findings over time. Third, the evaluation of outcomes \nfor service users employed a quasi-experimental design with a comparison group of service \nusers.   Fourth, it used a range of validated instruments and measures as well as qualitative \nresearch methods to examine change. \nThe Programme was long and intensive but was highly appreciated by those students who \nlasted the course (Level 1).  However it should be remembered that there was quite a high \ndrop-out rate and that many participants found the experience stressful.  There was little \nevidence of change in professional stereotypes (Level 2a).  Students reported a substantial \nincrease in knowledge of working in partnership with service users, multidisciplinary \nworking and psychosocial interventions (Level 2b).  This showed, in particular, in the greater \nconfidence with which they approached their work as part of multidisciplinary teams.  One \nimportant limitation of this study is that there was no independent evaluation of students\u2019 \nacquisition of knowledge and skills in PSIs, which relied on self-report.  An improved design \nwould involve the assessment by experts of videotapes of clinical interviews, such as in a \nstudy of the effectiveness of a nine-month programme in cognitive therapy (Milne et al., \n1999).  In this case, experts made ratings oblivious to the timing of the videotapes and rated \nstudents as being more competent at the end of the training.   \nSimilarly, the extent to which students implemented their learning was measured by self-\nreport, although this was generally corroborated in interviews with team colleagues and \nmanagers (level 3).  The knowledge gained on the programme did not make the students \n 22\nexpert practitioners of PSIs, nevertheless, they appeared reasonably successful in \nimplementing these approaches.  There was also some evidence from interviews with \nstudents and managers of changes in organisational practice which was attribute to students\u2019 \nlearning on the programme (Level 4a).  So, if students appreciated the course, considered that \nthey had learned and implemented new knowledge and skills, was there evidence that this led \nto improved outcomes for service users?  \nThe evaluation provided quite strong and consistent evidence that service users did indeed \nbenefit, improving in terms of their mental health, social functioning and self-perceived \nquality of life (Level 4b).  In general, the size of these improvements, which were measured \nover a six-month period, were modest, but would be recognised by most practitioners as \n\u2018clinically significant.\u2019  However, we must be careful in interpreting this finding.  First, we \ncannot attribute this effect to a singular aspect of the programme such as the students\u2019 use of \nPSIs because we cannot be entirely sure (because we relied on self-report) that the students \nactually applied the PSIs learned on the course faithfully.  The users\u2019 views survey and their \ncomments show that good user-professional relationships were significant; the course with its \nemphasis on values and user-centred practice may have had an impact on this aspect of the \nstudents\u2019 work as well.  Students considered that their interprofessional knowledge, skills and \npractice had improved and service users gave quite good ratings for these aspects of their \npractice, so it is possible that this also made a contribution.  As in most research in this field, \nit is likely to be a combination of many factors, not least the personality and motivation of the \nstudents themselves, which can account for these positive outcomes. \nThe quasi-experimental design employed in this evaluation allows us to consider the positive \noutcomes for service users in a comparative light.  Having applied a stringent and \nconservative statistical analysis, we can say that these is evidence that users in the \n\u201cprogramme\u201d groups improved very significantly more in terms of their life skills than users \nin comparator districts.  These \u2018life skills\u2019, which include such aspects as personal \n 23\ncommunication and social relationships as well as \u2018daily living\u2019 skills are essential to service \nusers with severe and enduring mental health problems living settled lives in the community.  \nThey were very much a focus of teaching and learning on the programme and consequently \nthis result may be considered a successful \u2018level 4b\u2019 outcome of the programme. \n \nProgramme group users did not however improve significantly more that the comparison \ngroups in terms of psychiatric symptoms and mental health.  The most recent review of \npostqualifying training in mental health (Bailey et al., 2003) found only two small scale \ncontrolled or comparative evaluations of (uni-professional) training for staff working with \nusers with severe mental health problems (Brooker, et al., 1992, 1994).  These studies did \nreport improvements in psychiatric symptoms as well as in social functioning in the \nprogramme groups compared to the controls, which were attributed to the behavioural family \ntherapy taught on the programme.  This method of intervention, which was also taught on the \nBirmingham programme, aims to decrease relatives\u2019 \u2018critical comments\u2019 and \n\u2018overinvolvement\u2019 which as believed to exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.  The \ndifference in outcomes between the two programmes may be because the course which \nBrooker and colleagues evaluated was a much more focused and intensive skills-based \nprogramme. \n \nIn conclusion, we consider that that this comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation provides \nquite encouraging evidence of the positive outcomes of interprofessional, post-qualifying \neducation at the various levels of learners\u2019 reactions, knowledge and skills, implementation of \nlearning and of benefits to users and carers.  These we attribute to the careful design of the \nprogramme and the quality of the teaching and learning opportunities provided as well as to \nthe resilience of the students who undertook a long and rigorous course. \n \n 24\nAcknowledgements \nThe evaluation was funded by the former National Health Service Executive (West \nMidlands).
