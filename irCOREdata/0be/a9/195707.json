It is shown that\nthe magnetic phenomena at the earthward site of a magnetic reconfiguration region\nare governed by field-aligned currents, which in their turn generate auroral brightenings\nnear the foot points of the spacecraft. It is also shown that the inward and outward\nmotion of the dipolarization front near Cluster has a direct influence on the parallel plasma\nflow at TC1, indicating a piston mechanism. Just like a piston, the inward moving\ndipolarization at Cluster pushes in plasma along with the flux transport, which turns\nto parallel plasma flow at TC1. When the flow reverses at Cluster, i.e., outgoing\nflux transport, the plasma gets \u2018\u2018sucked out\u2019\u2019 again, which is directly reflected\nin the plasma data from TC1.\nCitation: Volwerk, M., et al.

It has been shown that\nbefore substorm onset the magnetotail current sheet thins\n[e.g., Baumjohann et al., 1992; Sanny et al., 1994]. At\nsubstorm onset, on the earthward side of the reconfiguration\nregion, there will be fast earthward flows, often called bursty\nbulk flows (BBFs) [Baumjohann et al., 1990; Angelopoulos\net al., 1994; Scho\u00a8del et al., 2001a, 2001b; Nakamura et al.,\n2001a, 2001b]. The changes of the magnetic topology and\nthe energy release in the tail will be associated with various\nkinds of ionospheric phenomena such as aurora [Aikio et al.,\n2004;Morooka et al., 2004; Chaston et al., 2005] and (field-\naligned) currents [e.g., Untiedt and Baumjohann, 1993;\nKaufmann et al., 2001, 2003].\n[3] In this paper, a closer look is taken at the processes\nearthward from the reconfiguration site, with emphasis on\nthe currents associated with fast flows and flux transport.\nOne event in the Cluster tail season of 2005 is studied with a\nconjunction of Cluster and TC1.

The electron data will be checked to\nmake more qualitative estimates of the electron current\nflowing during the events.\n[4] The event in this paper gives a wider view of the\nactivity in the magnetotail during reconfiguration. With data\nfrom both Cluster and Double Star TC1 the range between\nXGSM \u0001 \u000216 RE and XGSM \u0001 \u00027 RE is probed and shown to\nbe directly linked. Indeed, e.g., both experiments show an\nincrease in the cross-tail current before substorm onset at\nbasically the same time, which will be discussed below.\n[5] A schematic view of the activity in themagnetotail near\nCluster and Double Star TC1 is given in Figure 1. Before\nsubstorm onset an increase in cross-tail current is measured at\nboth experiments. After onset a dipolarization front moves\nover two spacecraft of Cluster (C1\/2) showing clearly the\nfield-aligned currents flowing, and only the front part reach-\ning the other two spacecraft (C3\/4), before the dipolarization\nfront reverses. At the same time TC1 observes strong field-\naligned plasma flow moving earthward and then, as the\ndipolarization reverses at Cluster, the plasma flow at TC1\nbecomes parallel tailward. This indicates a piston motion of\nthe dipolarization front, pushing in and sucking out the\nplasma in the dipolarization flux tubes. Also, TC1 shows\nthe earthward currents, linking it to the \u2018\u2018back side\u2019\u2019 of the\ncurrent loops.\n2. Event\n[6] On 5 September 2005, between 0130 and 0200 UT,\nthere was strong activity in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. The\nsolar wind observatory ACE showed a southward turning\nof the magnetic field just before 0000 UT, which lasted\nuntil \u00030400 UT. The auroral images from Imager for\nMagnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)\nWideband Imaging Camera (WIC) [Mende et al., 2000] in\nFigure 2 show that there are two brightenings of the aurora, one\nat 0135 UT followed by another intensification at 0145 UT.\n[7] There was an opportune constellation at the nightside\nof the Earth, with Cluster near XGSM \u0001 \u000216 RE and Double\nStar TC1 near XGSM \u0001 \u00027 RE. An overview of the locations\nof the spacecraft is shown in Figure 3, where the field lines\nthrough the spacecraft have been traced using the T96 model\n[Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996], and listed in Table 1. Because\nof the strong activity in the magnetosphere, the field lines do\nnot show the real magnetic location of the spacecraft and are\nonly shown as indicative. The Cluster spacecraft are located\nnear 0030 LT, whereas TC1 is located just before 0000 LT.\n[8] This event is characterized by an onset determined\nfrom auroral images to be at \u00030135 UT, which means, with\nthe image rate from the IMAGE spacecraft it might be up to\n2 min earlier. Studying the auroral images, it is found that\nthere is another onset at \u00030145 UT. This second onset is of\ninterest because of a brightening of the aurora at the\npresumed foot points of the spacecraft and because the\nspacecraft measure strong flows and magnetic fluctuations.\nNote that most of the auroral activity is taking place at the\ndusk side of the magnetotail, which means that most likely\nthe main activity in the tail is not observed by the\nspacecraft.\n2.1. Double Star TC1 Observations\n[9] Before and after the substorm onset at\u00030135 UT there\nis little activity at TC1, only a slight increase in By, and no\nFigure 1.

In Figure 4 the magnetic field FGM [Carr\net al., 2005] and plasma HIA [Re`me et al., 2005] data are\nshown in the GSM coordinate system. The filled regions\nunder the graphs of the plasma velocity represent v?, the\ncomponent of the flow perpendicular to the magnetic field\n(v? = v \u0002 b^(v\u0005B)\/jBj). Starting at \u00030140 UT significant\ntailward (parallel to the field) and duskward (perpendicular\nto the field) plasma flows are observed at TC1. They last\nuntil \u00030143 UT and change direction in all three\ncomponents at \u00030144 UT just before the next onset at\n\u00030145 UT. Indeed, it could be argued that substorm onset\ntakes place at 0144 UT considering the 2-min resolution of\nthe auroral images. Note that the flows in the XGSM\ndirection are all parallel to the field, whereas in the Y \u0002\nZGSM directions the flows are basically completely\nperpendicular. The tailward flow is associated with a strong\nBy variation of the magnetic field. There is a slight decrease\nin Bz and an increase in Bx indicating a change in the field\nconfiguration from more dipole-like to more tail-like.\n[10] In Figure 4 (top) a feather plot of the perpendicular\nmagnetic field is shown. The data have been transformed\ninto a mean field-aligned (MFA) coordinate system (the\nmean field is determined by a low-pass filter passing\nvariations above 10 min) and is directed out of Figure 4\nand the two perpendicular directions are mainly eastward\n(along time axis) and northward (perpendicular to time\naxis). The first part between 0130 and 0143 UT shows an\nalmost regular variation of the field direction with a period\nof \u00034 min with some variations on the amplitude in the later\nones. Most likely, these are the signatures of transverse ULF\nwaves.\n[11] Just after the start of the increase of the magnetic\nfield strength (Bx and Bm) at \u00030140 UT, an indication of\nincreased cross-tail current, the small-amplitude transverse\nfield changes direction but does not rotate and just before\nthe end of the increased magnetic field at \u00030144 UT, the\nfield changes again and rotates counterclockwise. Such a\nsignature in the transverse field is often related to the\npresence of magnetic field-aligned currents. For examples\nof feather plot signatures of magnetic field-aligned current\ncrossings, see Volwerk et al. [1996, Figure 4]. The counter-\nclockwise rotation indicates a parallel current (with regard\nFigure 2. The Wideband Imaging Camera auroral images of the southern hemisphere. The foot points\nof Cluster are mapped to and shown in the auroral region. The foot point of TC1 is located slightly\nduskward of midnight.\nFigure 3. The locations of the spacecraft and the T96 field lines traced through them in the GSM xy and\nxz plane.\nA08S90 VOLWERK ET AL.: DIPOLARIZATION CURRENTS\n3 of 13\nA08S90\nto the magnetic field) and thus from the magnetosphere into\nthe ionosphere.\n[12] After the onset at \u00030145 UT the feather plot shows\ntwo counterclockwise rotations of the field at \u00030146 and\n\u00030148 UT. These rotations of the field seem to be well\ncorrelated with the two tailward flow bursts observed in the vx\npanel. These rotations are related to field-aligned earthward\ncurrents that start to flow near TC1, which are confirmed by\nthe electron data below.\n[13] The Plasma Electron And Current Experiment\n(PEACE) [Johnstone et al., 1997] data are shown in\nFigure 5; the first panel shows 0\u201315 degree pitch angle\nelectrons (parallel to the magnetic field), the second panel\nshows 75\u201390 degree pitch angle electrons (perpendicular\nto the magnetic field), and the third panel shows 165\u2013\n180 degree pitch angle electrons (antiparallel to the magnetic\nfield). The electron moments can give an indication of the\ncurrents flowing along the magnetic field, as shown by\nAlexeev et al. [2005]. In this paper we will only use the\nPEACE data for qualitative results on the electron current. In\nthe fourth panel of Figure 5 the difference between the\nparallel and antiparallel electron flux is shown.\n[14] Just after the first onset there is a net antiparallel\nelectron flux, which would indicate an earthward current,\nwhich is nicely visible in Figure 5 (bottom). During the time\naround the second onset at 0145 UT, it is difficult to infer\nwhich fluxes are stronger from the spectra; however, the\nbottom panel shows that around onset there is a net tailward\nelectron flux, which means earthward current, similarly for\nthe next rotation at 0147 UT.\n2.2. Cluster Observations\n[15] In Figure 6 we show the magnetometer data from\nFGM [Balogh et al., 2001] and the plasma data fromCISHIA\n(C1 and C3) and CODIF (C4) [Re`me et al., 2001] and feather\nplots of the perpendicular magnetic field for C2 and C1.\n[16] Before the onset determined at \u00030135 UT there is\nlittle activity in the magnetic field and plasma flows at\nCluster. After onset there are strong fluctuations in the Bx\nfor all four spacecraft. The fluctuations become less after\n\u00030140 UT, whereafter the Bx has increased significantly.\nFigure 7 shows a reduced version of the data, with the plasma\nflow velocity separated for the three spacecraft. It can be seen\nthat the oscillations of the magnetic field happen with strong,\nmainly perpendicular tailward flow, which lasts longer for C1\nas compared with C3 and C4. As soon as the oscillations die\nout, the flows also stop.\n[17] The difference in the Bx components of the magnetic\nfield data from C3 and C4, a closely separated pair in ZGSM in\nthis configuration, is used to get a proxy for the cross-tail\ncurrent. After the onset at \u00030135 UT the cross-tail current\nincreases (with some oscillations superposed). The increased\nlevel of the cross-tail current is maintained until \u00030144 UT,\nwhich is when the strong perpendicular earthward flow starts\nat C1. Also the differences in Bx between the spacecraft\nincrease, which indicates that the current sheet is thinning.\nNote that the change in bulk flow direction, from tailward to\nearthward, does not have a significant influence on the\nthinning of the current sheet or on the average cross-tail\ncurrent level apart from the dip at flow reversal, fromwhich it\nrecovers quickly and may be an artifact created by magnetic\nfield oscillations.\n[18] At 0144 UT the plasma flow at C1 turns mainly\nperpendicular to the magnetic field, while at the same time\nthe Bx of all spacecraft start to decrease and the cross-tail\ncurrent returns to its preevent value. Simultaneously for C1\nand C2 there is an increase in Bz, whereas By shows a slight\ndecrease for C1 and an increase for C2, with C1 and C2 in the\nsouthern and northern hemispheres of the tail, respectively.\nAt \u00030145 UT the flow reverses and becomes tailward.\nDuring the tailward flow the Bz signature slowly reduces to\nnear zero again and the Bx increases. These signatures show a\ndipolarization region moving earthward and receding again.\nThis could be an indication of the spacecraft being in the\nneighborhood of a reconnection X line [see, e.g.,Runov et al.,\n2003]. However, the poor correlation between the vx reversal\nand the BxBy signature suggests that the change in flow\ndirection is not associated with X line motion.\n[19] The magnetic signatures at C3 and C4 are quite\ndifferent from C1\/2. Although Bx decreases simultaneously\nwith C1 and C2, very little perpendicular flow is observed.\nThe decrease of Bx is not accompanied by an increase in Bz\nand thus this is no dipolarization. Immediately after\n0145 UT, there is a increase in both Bx and Bz with no\nsignature in By.\n[20] The feather plots show some rotations of the magnetic\nfield during the wavy period. C2 shows a single full rotation\nof the field at \u00030139 UT, whereas C1 shows two full\nrotations of the field approximately 1 min before and after\nthe observation of C2. This can either be created by the\nspacecraft passing by field-aligned currents or by elliptically\npolarized waves traveling along the field. At\u00030144UT, large\nrotations of the magnetic field are observed, counterclock-\nwise for C1 (parallel current) and clockwise for C2 (antipar-\nallel current), with both spacecraft in opposite hemispheres of\nthe tail this would indicate tailward current at both spacecraft.\nTwominutes later at\u00030146 UT, there are rotations again, this\ntime in the opposite direction and therefore oppositely\ndirected currents.\n[21] The PEACE data for this event for C1, C2 and C4\nare shown in Figure 9 in the same format as in Figure 5. At\n0139 UT, during the rotations of the field observed by C1\nand C2 the PEACE data show little indication of any\nTable 1.

This indicates first a parallel\n(tailward) current and then an antiparallel (earthward) cur-\nrent, as the spacecraft is in the Southern Hemisphere during\nthis interval. This agrees with the magnetic field rotations.\nFor C2, however, the situation is less clear. There is a slightly\nstronger antiparallel flux between 0145 and 0146 UT; there\nis little to say about the resulting flux after 0146 UT. C4\nshows between 0145 and 0146 UT (after onset) and just after\n0146 UT increased parallel electron fluxes, which would\nindicate a tailward current.\n2.3. Ground-Based Observations\n[23] As far as mapping of field lines can be trusted in active\nperiods of the magnetosphere, the foot points of the various\nspacecraft map closely to Greenland. The data of the mag-\nnetic field from the Greenland magnetometer chain are\nshown in Figure 10. The data are shown for the stations\nAttu, Godthab, Narsarsuaq, Sukkertoppen, and Sondre\nStromfjord (location is shown in Table 1). In Figure 10 the\ndata are stacked by latitude and shifted 100 nT between\nstations.\nFigure 4. Double Star TC1 data in GSM coordinates. (a) Feather plot of the perpendicular magnetic\nfield.

There is a mainly\nthe recovery of the field after the activity in the event before.\nHowever, at the onset at \u00030145 UT there are again negative\nbays in the higher-latitude stations in BH and there is a strong\nnegative bay for GHD in Bz, whereas SKT, STF, and ATU\nshow a positive bay. This shows that the westward electrojet\nis located northward from GHD.\n[25] Later in the event, at \u00030147 UT there is a reversal in\nthe Bz signature for STK from positive to negative DBz.\nThis indicates a northward shift of the westward electrojet\nat \u00030147 UT, which is near the end of the tailward flow\nmeasured by C1. Most likely, this is not unrelated to the\nFigure 5. Double Star TC1 PEACE data.

Interpretation\n[26] It should be noted that these events measured by TC1\nand Cluster are peripheral events connected to activity that is\nmainly taking place in the duskward side of the magnetotail.\nIn Figure 2 it is clear that very little is happening near the\nfoot points of Cluster and the foot point of TC1 (not shown\nin Figure 2) is located on the dawnward boundary of the\nactive region. However, despite the positions of the space-\ncraft, several interesting things happen. The events studied in\nthis paper are reminiscent of a study by Draper et al. [2005],\nwho looked at field-aligned current related to a tailward\ntraveling plasmoid.\n[27] From the location of the spacecraft it is clear that\nCluster and Double Star TC1 are in different environments in\nthe magnetotail. Cluster is located near the central plasma\nsheet, whereas TC1 is located at higher ZGSM and Bx in the\nlobe of the tail. The YGSM separation between the two\nexperiments is \b3.5 RE (greatest distance between C1 and\nFigure 6. Cluster data in GSM coordinates. (a\u2013b) Feather plot of the perpendicular magnetic field for\nC2 and C1.

The dashed lines show the starting times of\nevents E1 and E2.\nA08S90 VOLWERK ET AL.: DIPOLARIZATION CURRENTS\n7 of 13\nA08S90\nTC1). This means that statistically all spacecraft can be in\nthe influence region of the fast flow measured by C1.\nNakamura et al. [2004] have shown that the width of a\nflow channel in the tail is typically \b3 RE. This would mean\nthat the distance between C1 and TC1 would be slightly too\nlarge. However, timing analysis on the Bz component of the\nmagnetic field data from Cluster shows that the dipolariza-\ntion front is tilted in the X \u0002 YGSM plane in the direction\n[0.8, 0.6] (see Figure 1, right), which effectively reduces the\ndistance between C1 and TC1. We may therefore assume\nthat TC1 will measure effects related to magnetic and flow\nactivity registered at the Cluster spacecraft.\n[28] We concentrated on the large-scale behavior of the\nmagnetotail in the region where Cluster and Double Star are\nlocated, i.e., the fast flows at Cluster and the inward-outward\nmotion of the dipolarization, the fast field-aligned flows at\nTC1, and the associated currents and signatures on the\nground. A summary of what is observed is given in Table 2\nand graphically depicted in Figure 1.\n[29] It was found that C1 and C2 are on opposite sides of\nthe neutral sheet during 0144\u20130146 UTand have opposite By\nsignatures. The nonchanging By signatures over the flow\nreversal show that the spacecraft are not at a reconnection X\nline but most likely are observing current systems related to\nthe observed dipolarization. Clearly, the perpendicular flow\nover the spacecraft must be started, stopped, and reversed, at\nthe same time creating the dipolarization and By signature.\nThis can be done by, e.g., inertial currents [Haerendel, 1992].\n[30] The perpendicular earthward flow is transporting\nmagnetic flux over the two spacecraft. On the boundary\nof this structure currents are flowing, as can be seen in the\nfeather plots of C1 and C2. At the start of the dipolarization\nFigure 7.

Slightly later, as the\ndipolarization reaches C2, there is a clockwise rotation of\nthe field, which means an antiparallel current. These cur-\nrents will be closed as shown in Figure 1, thereby creating\nthe impression of two current loops which create the\nopposite By signatures measured by C1 and C2. Integrating\nthe vx,? signature shows that the structure can reach C3 and\nFigure 8. Combined data from C1, C2, C3, and TC1.

The two solid vertical\nlines show the time of substorm onset.\nA08S90 VOLWERK ET AL.: DIPOLARIZATION CURRENTS\n9 of 13\nA08S90\nC4 before the perpendicular flow reverses. The structure\nmoves tailward again, and C1 and C2 exit and the\ndipolarization gradually changes to a stretched field line\nconfiguration again.\n[31] The C3 and C4 spacecraft observe a different mag-\nnetic structure, an increased Bx and an increased Bz with no\nBy signature. These spacecraft remain in the northern\nhemisphere. The currents associated with this structure are\nantiparallel. This would be in agreement with the loop in the\nnorthern hemisphere reaching these two spacecraft. These\nspacecraft are basically located in the neutral sheet, which\nexplains why there is both an increase in Bx and Bz, created\nby the current system.\n[32] The Cluster PEACE data confirm the deduced cur-\nrents from the feather plots, tailward currents at both C1 and\nC2 at the beginning and earthward currents later. C4 shows a\nresidual parallel electron flux and thus a tailward current\nafter the onset at 0145 UT. This means that the front of the\ncurrent loop reaches and crosses C3\/4 and moves back over\nthese spacecraft again. With C3\/4 in the northern hemisphere\nof the tail, it is expected that they observe the same current\nsignature as C2 at the beginning, which is indeed the case.\n[33] The closure of the currents can happen in two ways:\neither along the X direction or in the Y direction, as indicated\nin Figure 1 by the arrows in the X direction and the two\n(toward and away) symbols for the Y direction. Using the\nproxy for the cross-tail current in Figure 7, it can be seen that\nas the perpendicular flow starts at C1 the cross-tail current\nstarts to increase, whereas when the perpendicular flow\nreverses the cross-tail current starts to decrease. This is an\nindication that the currents in the loops are mainly closed\nalong the Y direction. The interpretation for this is easily\nFigure 10. The Greenland magnetometer data for five stations stacked by latitude and shifted for\nvisibility: ATU (black, +200 nT), STF (magenta, +100 nT), SKT (blue), GHB (red, \u0002100 nT), and\nNAQ (green, \u0002200 nT). The coordinate system is such that H is northward, E is eastward, and\nZ completes the triad and is radially inward.\nA08S90 VOLWERK ET AL.: DIPOLARIZATION CURRENTS\n10 of 13\nA08S90\nfound. The perpendicular flow transports magnetic flux, and\nin order to get the field lines moving in the X direction there\nhas to be a force. The spacecraft are not at the reconfiguration\nregion, where it may be assumed that the tension of the\nmagnetic field will help to accelerate the field and plasma.\nTherefore, there has to be another force, the Lorentz force,\nwhich sets the field in motion. Indeed, for earthward accel-\neration a positive Jy is needed and for decelerating and\nreversal a negative Jy (see, e.g., the inertial currents given\nby Shiokawa et al. [1997]).\n[34] How does the fast parallel tailward flow and the\ncurrents observed by TC1 fit into the global picture? This is\neasily explained with the flows observed at Cluster and\nFigure 8. Just after the flow at Cluster starts to turn\nperpendicular and thus starts to move flux inward, the\nparallel earthward flow starts at TC1. Then just after\n0145 UT the perpendicular flow at Cluster turns tailward\nand almost simultaneously the parallel flows at TC1 reverse\nand turn tailward. The motion of the magnetic flux, i.e., the\ndipolarization and stretching works as a piston in the\nmagnetotail. First, it will push in the plasma, also evidenced\nby the earthward parallel flow observed by Cluster before\n0143 UT. At the sudden reversal of the flow, the plasma is\n\u2018\u2018sucked\u2019\u2019 out again by the flux moving outward, like a\npiston.\n[35] Interestingly, the currents that were determined for\nTC1 during 0145\u20130148 UT are oppositely directed from the\ncurrents observed by C2, even though the spacecraft are in\nthe same hemisphere of the magnetotail. In the large-scale\nmodel assumed in this paper, this can be interpreted in, at\nleast, two ways: either TC1 is located at higher magnetic\nlatitude then C2 and observes the earthward current on the\nnorth side of the loop in Figure 1 or TC1 and C2 are located\nnear the opposite boundaries of the current channel and the\ncurrents can be seen as a small substorm current wedge.\n[36] The reversal of the BZ signature at the Greenland\nstation SKT at \u00030146 UT indicates a northward moving of\nthe electrojet. This in agreement with the outward moving\ndipolarization front observed at Cluster.\n4. Discussion\n[37] In all, the whole event shows the characteristics of a\nreconnection\/current disruption event in the region tailward\nof Cluster. Similar to reconnection, current disruption can\ncause earthward flow when it is located tailward of an\nobserving site as discussed by Lui et al. [1993]. The overall\npicture shows that after a previous substorm event the\nmagnetotail is stretched again and the cross-tail current\nincreases (over the whole region between TC1 and Cluster)\nand the current sheet thins. Substorm onset, the reconfig-\nuration of the magnetic field, the production of plasma\nflow, and magnetic flux transport, is tailward from Cluster\nat 0144 UT, which stops rather quickly and the inward\nmoving flux moves outward again.\n[38] The currents that are discussed above are not directly\nmeasured by, e.g., the curlometer technique, as the spacecraft\nare not well situated. Only the inference from magnetic field\nrotations combined with simultaneous electron data have\ngiven us insight into the magnetic field-aligned currents\nrelated to this dipolarization, without giving any quantitative\nresults for the current density. The combination of the two\nshows that the spacecraft are physically crossing the current\nlayers. The question may arise whether the signatures that\nhave been measured cannot be explained by other mecha-\nnisms, such as waves. Indeed, this may well be the case for\nthe rotation in the magnetic field observed by Cluster at\n\u00030140 UT during the oscillation Bx period, for which there\nis no evidence in the PEACE data that there is a net\ndifferential electron current present.\n[39] The interpretation of the earthward current measured\nby TC1 as part of the current loop passing by C2 could be\nquestioned and has been in the text above. It could well be\nargued that because of the half an hour local time difference\nbetween TC1 and C2, the spacecraft is not observing that\nloop but rather the \u2018\u2018return current\u2019\u2019 of a small substorm\ncurrent wedge. However, as also noted in the introduction,\nthe event in this paper is peripheral to the large processes\ngoing on in the duskward side of the magnetotail, and\ntherefore, it does not seem likely that a mini substorm current\nwedge will be created.\n[40] The interpretation of the strong parallel plasma flow\nat Double Star TC1, during \u00030144\u20130147 UT, as produced\nby the motion of the dipolarization front observed by\nCluster definitely calls for a large scale process in the\nmagnetotail. Naturally, it could be that TC1 is located near\nthe PSBL, where strong plasma flows are often generated\n[see, e.g., Baumjohann et al., 1988]. However, the statistical\nwidth of a flow channel and the direction of propagation of\nthe dipolarization front show that Double Star TC1 is in the\ninfluence region of the fast flow that is measured by Cluster.\nTable 2.

Conclusions\n[41] During a substorm on 5 September 2005 we have\nstudied a dipolarization front moving inward and outward\nover the Cluster spacecraft. The spacecraft were located near\nthe boundary of the active region. Simultaneously, there were\nmeasurements by Double Star TC1. The auroral images show\nthat the main activity is located on the duskside of midnight\nalmost extending to the foot point of Double Star TC1,\nwhereas near the foot point of Cluster there are only smaller\nbrightenings of the aurora.\n[42] The dipolarization at C1\/2, with oppositely directed\nBy signatures for both spacecraft, is associated with two\ncurrent loops in both hemispheres of the magnetotail. The\nearthward side of these loops move over C3\/4, before the\nmotion reverses again.\n[43] This inward-outward motion of the dipolarization\nfront has a direct influence on the plasma flow observed\nby TC1, where we find that this motion most likely works as\na piston. The motion of the dipolarization front is reflected in\nthe ground magnetometer observations, where the westward\nelectrojet moves northward during the tailward motion of the\ndipolarization front after 0145 UT.\n[44] Acknowledgments.
