Less is known about the roles, \ncareer pathways, characteristics and career aspirations of the professoriate \nwithin these emerging professions. \nA survey was undertaken from sample populations in each of the three \nprofessorial groups in order to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on \nprofessorial roles and activities, career pathway information and support \nmechanisms for professorial positions. This paper discusses the findings of \nthe survey which relate specifically to professorial roles and activities and \nwhether the identified roles reflect the professorial activities proposed by the \nNational Conference of University Professors (NCUP) \nOther aspects of this survey including career pathways, findings relating to \ngender and support mechanisms will form the basis of future papers. \nResults \nThe findings suggest that the professorial roles studied in this survey reflect \nthose described by the National Conference of University Professors. \nProfessors of nursing, allied health professions and social work balance a \nwide range of roles and activities. Research, and related activities, as one \nwould expect, constitute a substantial aspect of work activity but many \nprofessors express frustration with an environment which requires an  \nheterogeneous role profile  combined with an unrealistically high workload in \norder to successfully pursue their research careers.  \nThe survey highlighted support networks as a critical success factor in terms \nof professorial career development. However, professors from across the \ndisciplines commented on the lack of support (institutional and external) \navailable to professors both pre- professorial and professorial grades. \nEstablished and personal chair holders appear to have similar roles with few \nstatistically significant differences found between these two sub-populations. \n \n \n 1\n \nKey words \nProfessorial roles, Nursing and Midwifery, \nSocial Work, Allied Health Professions \n \nIntroduction \nProfessors in the United Kingdom, within nursing and midwifery, allied health \nprofessions and social work hold influential positions as academic\/clinical \nacademic researchers and leaders and role models within their respective \nprofessions (Watson and Thompson, 2004). \nHowever, they do not always embark upon and plan a definitive career route \nwhich would direct them towards clinical\/academic research leadership. \nSerendipity rather than pre-meditated career planning appears to be the norm \nin terms of career pathway trajectory (Jackson and Butterworth, 2007), \n(Turner, 2007). \nLeaving career planning to serendipity, one could argue, may not be the most \nappropriate method of identifying and developing our future clinical academic \nresearch leaders. Furthermore as Bamberg et al suggest for allied health \nprofessions, failure to properly engage in actively securing research \nleadership succession could have a detrimental impact on our professions \nand the educational programmes from which our future leaders will emerge \n(Bamberg et al, 2000). \nIt is timely therefore to examine more carefully, the roles and activities \nundertaken and the support received by the professoriate during their \nresearch careers in order to develop targeted support mechanisms to assist \nthe professions in developing strategies to support aspiring research leaders \nof the future. \n \nThe role of the professoriate and the National Conference of University \nProfessors \nRolfe (2007) suggested that the primary role of professors of nursing is to \nenable, facilitate and support practising nurses to set their own educational, \nresearch and practice agenda. This is to encourage closer and more \ncollaborative links between clinical practice and academia and between \ndisciplines. This approach is supported by the United Kingdom Clinical \nResearch Collaboration (UKCRC, 2007) in its report of the UKCRC \nSubcommittee for nurses in Clinical Research (Workforce). This report \nalthough relating its recommendations primarily to the nursing profession \nacknowledges the applicability to the allied health professions. In an earlier \nstudy, Butterworth et al, in 2005 suggests that supporting future generations \nof all healthcare professionals by developing clinical practice alongside \nscholarly activities in research and education is becoming an important modus \noperandi for the healthcare workforce. The National Conference of University \nProfessors (NCUP) is an organisation which aims to support all university \nprofessors to carry out their special responsibilities in terms of maintaining \nacademic standards (NCUP, 2009) \nThe role of the professoriate was reviewed by the National Conference of \nUniversity Professors (NCUP, 1991)). This multi disciplinary Conference \npublished through its Policy Document no.2, the NCUP identifies 8 key roles \nattributable to the role of a University professor. \n 2\n\u0083 Established and Personal Chairs \nProfessors are appointed to Established Chairs to provide leadership in their \nsubject of specialisation and they are expected to play an organisational role. \nPersonal Chairs are elected on the strength of national\/international \ndistinction in their field of scholarship which at local level provides for an \nidentified stream of research within a department \n\u0083 Academic Standing \nProfessors should have outstanding authority in their field. \n\u0083 Research and Scholarship \nProfessors should be expected to maintain individual and authoritative \nindustry in scholarship and research and by example encourage other staff in \ntheir subject to engage in original work. \n\u0083 Teaching \nProfessors\u2019 scholarly activities should be reflected in U\/G course \ndevelopment, PG seminars and research training \n\u0083 Acquisition of resources \nOrganisation of physical, IT and human resources to support professorial \nsubject area \n\u0083 Powers of communication \nProfessors should demonstrate cogent expression through spoken and written \ncommunication skills and be able to defend their judgements effectively \n\u0083 Services to the Wider University Community \nProfessors should be prepared to undertake committee work, become \nmembers of review groups and be active in its Senate (or equivalent) thus \nmaking a vital contribution to the esprit de corps of the academic community \n\u0083 Services Outside the University \nProfessors should play a role in the external community through such \nfunctions as external scholarly activity, sitting on local and national boards \nand consultancy work. \n \nThe foregoing statements represent a heterogeneous set of activities which \nare grounded in the principles of academic tradition. There is an expectation \nthat professoriate will, in fulfilling these roles, be able to support and advance \ntheir individual professional fields of interest as well as contributing to the \nscholarly life of the University.  \n \nResearch design, method and analysis \nThe primary objective of this study is to discover whether the professorial \npopulation across nursing, allied health professions and social work reflect the \nfunctions and roles defined by the National Conference of University \nProfessors. \nIt was felt that the most appropriate instrument for this study was to survey a \nself-selected sample population identified from a database of potential \nresponders. The sample population was required to complete the survey \nusing a self administered questionnaire. \nThe population is defined as professors of nursing, allied health professions \n(relating to the Health Professions Council) and social work. These academic \ndisciplines have, in the main, provided undergraduate pre- registration degree \nprogrammes within higher education during the last two decades. Allied \nHealth Professions began pre registration degree programmes during the \n 3\n1990\u2019s, the majority of degree programmes in nursing followed shortly after \nthis time and pre-registration degree programmes in social work have \ndeveloped during the past few years. \nThese professional disciplines therefore do not have a comparable academic \nhistory with more established disciplines (such as medicine) and there is a \npaucity of published workforce data available around academic leaders within \nthese disciplines. This lack of data was an influencing factor in forming the \nrationale for this study. \n \nEthical approval  \nEthical approval was granted for this study by the host research team\u2019s \nUniversity Ethics Committee. \n \nSurvey protocol: Establishing a preliminary data base  \nTo complete this survey, a database of possible professors in the targeted \ndisciplines had to be established. \nAll UK Universities with undergraduate or postgraduate programmes in \nnursing, allied health professions and social work had their web sites \ninterrogated for relevant professorial positions.  \nTable1 shows the sampling frame and numbers of professorial posts included \nin the preliminary database. It should be noted however that there were \ndifficulties in clearly identifying some professors by professional discipline \nthrough professorial titles alone and further identifiers, such as professional \nqualifications were utilised following preliminary analysis of the \nquestionnaires. \n \nInsert table 1 here \n \n \nDeveloping the questionnaire \nThe questionnaire was designed to elicit both qualitative and quantitative data \nbased on the roles outlined by the National Conference of University \nProfessors (1991) and adapted to reflect health care professionals. The \nquestionnaire was constructed so that information could be obtained on the \nfollowing data sets \nQuantitative information on: \n\u2022 Personal information (including age, gender) \n\u2022 Information on current appointment- including title, whole time \nequivalence, funding, salary range, type of appointment \n\u2022 Time spent on professorial role activities \n\u2022 Amount of administrative support \n\u2022 Types pre- and post- appointment support\/ career development  \nreceived \n\u2022 Professional status, qualifications and membership of bodies\/networks \nQualitative information on \n\u2022 Comments on selection process for the post \n\u2022 Comments on administrative support \n\u2022 Comments on pre- and post- appointment support\/ career development  \nreceived \n\u2022 Open-ended questions on barriers to professorial posts \n 4\n\u2022 Open-ended questions on major issues for professors \n\u2022 Questions on factors that professors felt were important in gaining their \nposts \nThe questionnaire was piloted prior to distribution in the host institution. \nAdditional questions relating to administrative support were added to the final \nquestionnaire. \n \nThe questionnaire was initially distributed electronically using the preliminary \ndatabase information. The purpose of the census-style approach was to \nattempt to identify more clearly (using response data) those professors who \nwere within the identified professional groups. It was anticipated therefore that \nthe analysis of data would be carried out on a reduced sample \n(accounting for non- responders and cleaning of the sample) \n \nAn e- link was provided to allow participants to respond electronically.  \nParticipants could also email to get a printable word version. \n \nAn email introducing the survey and purpose was sent with the questionnaire.  \nA further email or postal reminder was sent out six weeks after the invitation \nto participate to non responders. \n \nResponse data \nA preliminary review of each response enabled the researchers to more \nclearly identify those professors who had qualified as nurses, allied health \nprofessionals (as defined by the Health Professions Council) and social \nworkers. These populations were included in the analysis.  \nTable 2 shows the final sample for the survey by professional discipline. \nThe mean response from the distributed questionnaires (following review and \ncleaning of the sample) was 27.8%. Nursing and midwifery responses (n=53) \nrepresented the highest percentage within the sample (32.9%), allied health \nprofessions (25.4%) and social work (19.7%). \nIt is difficult to provide accurate figures with respect to responses relative to \nthe true total populations of these disciplines. Centralised data intelligence on \nprofessorial posts is not available for allied health professions. Professors of \nSocial Work have a member organisation (Association of Professors of Social \nWork) with a mailing list of 102 which, according to Moriarty (2009) contains \nemeriti professors as well as established and personal chairs. The Royal \nCollege of Nursing collects data on professorial position within nursing, but it \nis clear from the web sites of academic departments that there are professors \nwith a nursing qualification working in disciplines which are not related to \nnursing.  \n \nData analysis \nQualitative data were analysed using NVivo 7 (QSR) software which allowed \nfor detailed single case analysis, numeric summary information and emergent \ninterpretative summaries using responses from the open ended questions and \ncomments sections of the questionnaire. \nQuantitative data were analysed using SPSS 14.0 for Windows (Statistical \nPackage for the Social Sciences) and principal component analysis (PCA) \nwas used for exploratory data analysis.  PCA is a mathematical procedure \n 5\nthat transforms a number of possibly correlated variables into a smaller \nnumber of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The first \nprincipal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as \npossible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the \nremaining variability as possible (Jackson, 1992). Only Eigenvalues greater \nthan one were used in the analysis. The components were rotated using the \nVarimax method with Kaiser Normalization. \n \nDescriptive and inferential statistics enabled detailed analyses of a number of \nvariables. This article presents findings mainly using data for professional \ngrouping, professorial roles and type of appointment. \n \nSummary findings: Demographic characteristics \nTable 3 shows demographic characteristics of the sample populations by \nprofessional group. \n \nInsert table 3 here \n \nProfessors in all three professions had a mean age above 50years. \nProfessors in the allied health professions were the youngest group with the \nshortest time in post. Social workers had the highest mean age. This was \nsignificant (t (22) = -2.425; p=0.024) when comparing social work professors \n(M=58.45; SD=9.97) with the allied health professions (M=50.85; SD=4.96) \nThis is not unexpected as academic departments in social policy and social \nwork have been in existence for longer than academic departments in nursing \nand allied health professions. \nWith respect to the gender balance within each of the three professions, there \nare data relating to female to male ratios for the nursing profession only. \nStatistical data from the Nursing and Midwifery Council (2008) shows a \nfemale to male ratio of 9:1 for the registered population. The data from this \nsurvey would suggest that male professors are over-represented in this \npopulation (F: M ratio 3.7:1) compared to the registered population. These \nresults must be interpreted with some caution due to the small sample size \nrelative to the full survey population. \nHowever, Jackson (2008) reported that in an analysis of data provided by \nHESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency) nurses studying for doctoral \nqualifications showed a female to male ratio of 4:1. This suggests that a \ngreater percentage of male nurses are pursuing higher level qualifications \ncompared to female nurses which is then continued through into academic \nleadership positions. \n \nSummary findings: Key roles of the professorial populations \n \ni) Professorial roles and scholarly activities \nAll participants in this study carried out a wide range of internal (to the \nemploying university) and external activities as part of their roles. The NCUP \nexpect professors to offer services to the wider university community and \nservices outside the university. \nProfessors undertook research, research related duties (such as funding, \nsupervision and supporting research assessment), teaching and general \n 6\nmanagerial and committee responsibilities. This range of roles identified in \nthis survey reflects the guidelines set out by the NCUP and is now discussed \nin more detail here. \n \nTable 4 shows the breakdown of professorial roles and activities by \nprofession. \n \nInsert table 4 here \n \nFor the majority of the variables shown in table 4, no significant differences \nwere found between the professional groups. There was however, a \ndifference noted with respect to research supervision. \n \nii) Research supervision  \nA univariate ANOVA was conducted for the factors \u2018time spent on internal \nresearch supervision\u2019 and \u2018professional group\u2019 (nurses and midwives v. AHPs \nv. social workers). The results demonstrated a significant difference between \nthe amount of time that the three professions spend on internal (to the \ninstitution) research supervision (F (2, 68) = 5.018; p = 0.009). Tukey post hoc \ntests showed that there was a significant differences between nurses \n(M=15.89; SD=8.32) and social workers (M=7.93; SD=10.99) with nurses \nspending more time in internal research supervision when compared to social \nworkers, (p = 0.015), no difference between nurses and AHPs (p = 0.139) and \nno difference between AHPs (M=10; SD=9.75) and social workers (p = 0.839). \nThe results thus show that nurses and midwives spend significantly more time \nundertaking internal research supervision when compared to social workers, \nthe difference is not significant between nurses and midwives and AHPs and \nthere is no difference between AHPs and social workers. \n \niii) Balance and relationship between research, teaching and \nmanagement activities \n \nAnalysis of the data around the relationship and balance of activities was \nundertaken using a principal components analysis and the results are \npresented by professional group. \n \nProfessors in nursing and midwifery \n \nInsert tables 5.a and 5b here \n \nComponent 1 Academic Research \nAcademic research, research funding activities and general management are \ncomplementary activities for nurses and midwives. These activities are carried \nout at the expense of clinical research. This is supported by the qualitative \nanalysis which indicates that nurses and midwives are frustrated by the \ncompeting demands on their time which limits opportunity to develop clinical \nresearch. \n \nComponent 2 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and Research \nSupervision \n 7\nThese roles appear to be complementary activities and once again, clinical \nresearch opportunities are compromised. \n \nComponent 3 RAE activities \nProfessors carry our RAE related activities at the expense of teaching. \n \n \n \nProfessors of Social Work \n \nInsert table 6a and 6b here \n \nComponent 1  Teaching and research \nTime spent in academic research is inversely proportional to both research \nfunding and teaching activities. This would suggest there is a conflict between \nthe short term deadlines seen with teaching and research funding compared \nwith the demands of longer term activities such as academic research. \nThis effect is supported by the qualitative responses from this group. \n \nComponent 2 Research supervision and to a lesser extent, RAE and \nresearch funding activities are carried out in preference to clinical research. \n \nComponent 3 Management activities \nThis component suggests that management appears to be neglected in favour \nof academic research \n \nComponent 4 Clinical research and RAE activities are complementary \n(mild effect) \n \nProfessors in Allied Health Professions \n \nInsert tables 7a and 7b here. \n \nComponent 1 RAE activities and research supervision  \nThese roles are complementary activities for AHPs and are prioritised over \nteaching.  \nThe tension between RAE activities and teaching was clearly identified by \nprofessors in Allied Health Professions from the free text comments within the \nquestionnaire. One AHP professor stated that the RAE had \u2018a poisonous \nimpact\u2019 on professorial roles. \n \nComponent 2 Research funding and clinical research \nThese two activities are complementary and are carried out at the expense of \nmanagement activities. \n \nComponent 3 Research  \nAcademic research and clinical research are competing elements of the \nprofessorial role. \n \nBalancing professorial roles- further discussion \n 8\nAnalysis of the qualitative responses in relation to roles and activities revealed \nthat managing the diverse activities which encompass a professorial role was \na major issue across all three professions. Research was highlighted as the \nmost important role but delivery of this was compromised by other \nresponsibilities. \n  \nBalancing research and teaching was a major concern for the majority of \nresponders and there was clear dissonance between expectations of senior \nmanagers wishing to boost the university research profile and staff with \nresponsibilities for delivering on the teaching agenda. Professors appear to be \ncaught in the middle of the teaching-research dilemma. This dilemma was \nnoted by Sparkes (2007) in his fictionalised ethnographical reflections of \nprofessorial roles in academia within a growing and pervasive audit culture. \nHis insightful depiction of university professors attempting to balance \nmanagerial expectations relating to research outputs and income generation \nwith the competing pressures of professorial roles has congruence with the \nfindings of this study.  \n \niv) Academic standing \nThe NCUP expects professors to have outstanding authority in the field. \nEvidence relating to this aspect of the professorial role was identified through \na question which sought qualitative responses relating to success factors. \nProfessors were asked to provide a personal view on factors which they \nconsidered were vital to a successful professorial position. \nThe factors were analysed, coded and categorised and the following three \ncategories emerged from the data. \n \na) National\/international reputation within their peer community \nProfessors included here examples such as research success with high \nquality publications, profile as a visionary clinical research leader and \nexcellence in teaching. This supports the expectations around academic \nstanding stated by the NCUP. The importance of developing international \nlinks was highlighted as a factor for successful professorial appointments. \nProfessional organisations are developing European and international \nplatforms, enabling early career researchers to obtain research data and \ndevelop research networks. For example,  Workgroups of European Nurse \nResearchers (WENR)  provides details of current conferences and \ndemographic data in nursing, which in a 2005  census,  included  data by \ncountry on relevant research contacts, numbers of doctoral students and \nprofessors of nursing.  \n \n \nb) Personal characteristics \nProfessors identified hard work (including excessive hours), a passion for the \njob and commitment to the subject area, perseverance and determination. \nSeveral female professors commented stated that their success was linked to \ntheir decision not to take a career break when becoming a parent. \n \nA study by the British Medical Association (2004) suggested that female \ndoctors who took career breaks to have children were at a disadvantage in \n 9\nterms of career promotion because of the traditional time- related positioning \non the promotional spectrum. \n \nc) Support networks \nProfessors expressed impassioned views on the importance of effective \nsupport to success and resultant academic standing. This included both \ninstitutional and peer support networks. \nReceiving high quality supervision to develop research leadership skills and \nmentorship to assist with career pathway decisions were felt to be important \ncontributory factors in developing a successful professorial career. \nThe support was more prevalent in pre- professorial positions than it was post \nappointment and a number of recently appointed professors expressed a wish \nfor more continued support during the early phase of the post. \nIt was noted that whilst there was a strong consensus on this factors for \nsuccess, almost half of the population stated that in their view the support \nthey received was ad hoc, self-determined, too informal or non-existent. \nBoth male and female professors commented that partner support was \nimportant.  \nRecent post doctorate training initiatives such as the Clinical Lectureship \ncompetition (2010) for nurses, midwives and allied health professions,  \nsponsored by the  National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) will provide \nadditional and welcome support for aspiring research leaders in these \nprofessions.  However, it is worth reiterating that early career professors wish \nto additional and extended support provided in order to support their career \nand roles. \n \nv) Acquisition of resources \n \nInsert table 8 here \n \nNCUP refer to human resources to support professorial subject areas and the \nsurvey produced data relating to administrative support and research capacity \nthrough the use of research assistants. \n \nIn terms of administrative support, the results seen in table 8 shows inter \nprofessional variability. Holding a further position such as Head of School or \nDean will act as a confounding variable and as such, the results should be \ntreated with some caution. Nevertheless, it is clear that lack of administrative \nsupport was a source of contention amongst this population and in addition \nthere are significant differences between the professions. \nA univariate ANOVA was conducted for the factors \u2018amount of administrative \nsupport\u2019 and \u2018professional group\u2019 (nurses\/midwives v. AHPs v. social \nworkers). The results demonstrated a significant difference between the three \nprofessional groups for the amount of administrative support that they receive \n(F (2, 80) = 6.529; p = 0.002). Tukey post hoc tests showed that there was a \nsignificant difference between nurses and AHPs (p = 0.028), a significant \ndifferences between nurses\/midwives and social workers (p = 0.009) and no \ndifference between AHPs and social workers (p = 0.986). The results thus \nshow that nurses have significantly more administrative support than the other \n 10\ntwo professional groups while AHPs and social workers do not differ from \neach other in the amount of support that they receive. \n \n \nProfessors across all three professions suggest that research capacity \ndevelopment is currently problematic, citing a number of contributory factors. \nThe lack of suitably qualified senior lecturers and post-doctoral staff \ncompromises the ability to maintain a critical mass within departments and \nmany commented on the lack of discipline \u2013 specific research assistants. \n \nvi) Established and personal chairs \nThe NCUP identifies clear and different roles for established (competitive) and \npersonal chairs. \nThis study found only a few significant differences between competitive and \npersonal professorial positions with differences relating to the percentage time \nspent in internal funding activities and percentage time spent on external \nmanagement- related duties. \nGeneral characteristics \nIndependent t-tests exploring the theoretically interesting differences between \nthe experiences of established appointments compared to personal \nappointments revealed no differences based on gender between the two \ngroups, age profile, length of time since appointment or the amount of \nadministrative support received.  \n \nAcademic research \nWith respect to the amount of time spent in research (clinical and academic) \nthere were no significant differences between the two sub-populations. \n \nManagement activities \nThere was a significant difference between the two groups on the amount of \ntime spent on external managerial activities (t (49.63) = 2.627; p = 0.011) with \nestablished chairs (M= 2.4; SD = 6.25) spending more time on this type of \nactivity than personal chairs (M = 0.07, SD = 0.38). This might suggest that \nestablished chairs do exhibit a stronger external profile, thus supporting the \nNCUP guidelines. \n \nResearch supervision and teaching activities \nThere were no significant differences found. \n \nResearch funding activities \nThere was a significant difference between the two sub-populations for the \namount of time that they spent on internal research funding activities (t (76) = \n2.396; p = 0.019) with established chairs spending longer on these activities. \nNo significant differences were found between the two groups for the amount \nof time spent on external funding activities or for overall funding activities. \nThere were no significant differences between the two groups for the amount \nof time spent in research assessment exercise activities. \n \n \n \n \n 11\nSummary: established and personal chairs \nThe above results taken as a whole would suggest that the two sub- \npopulations of established and personal chairs have very similar professorial \nroles but established chairs demonstrate a stronger external profile. \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \nThe survey identified that the roles and activities undertaken professors in \nnursing and midwifery, allied health professions and social work closely align \nwith the key roles identified through the NCUP.  \nProfessors in these professions undertake a wide variety of roles both within \nand external to, their employing universities. Balancing the roles associated \nwith a professorial position together with the expectations and pressures \nbrought about by the current audit culture is identified as a major source of \ntension for this population. Professors have clearly articulated a desire to \nreceive better, more targeted and sustainable support form their institutions \nand their peer networks through improved mentorship arrangements and \nbetter career pathway guidance. This support appears necessary, not only   \nfor aspiring professors and those in the early part of their professorial careers \nbut also for professors in more established posts. \n  \n 12\n \nTables \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1 the sampling frame: professors included in the preliminary \ndatabase according to discipline \n \n \nDiscipline Number included on the database \nUnclassified1 2 \nAllied Health Professions 55 \nNursing and midwifery 161 \nSocial Work 86 \nPsychology 2 22 \nTotal 326 \n \n \n \n \nTable 2 Number of responses analysed by profession \n \nProfession Number of responses \nanalysed \nNumber of \nquestionnaires \ndistributed \nNursing\/Midwifery 53 161 \nAllied Health  14 55 \nSocial Work 17 86 \n \n \n \nTable 3  Demographic characteristics of the populations \n \nNursing and midwifery Female Male \nMean age 52.95 53.40 \nMean time in present \npost \n6.07 6.27 \nMean time as a \nprofessor \n7.08 6.40 \nMean salary \u00a350,001- \u00a355,000 \u00a355,001 -
