In this paper, we present the findings and the policy proposals of \nthe task group focusing on inequalities in priority public health conditions  \nMethods: A series of rapid literature reviews of the policy relevant international evidence base was \nundertaken. Quantitative studies of any design which looked at the effects on health inequalities, the \nsocial gradient or overall population health effects, of interventions designed to address the social \ndeterminants of public health priority conditions were examined.  \nResults: Five key proposals for policy and practice were made: Reduce smoking in the most deprived \ngroups; Improve availability of and access to healthier food choices amongst low income groups; \nImprove the early detection and treatment of diseases; Introduce a minimum price per unit for alcohol; \nImprove the links between physical and mental health care. There were nine secondary proposals \nand a research proposal.  \nConclusion: There is a dearth of robust evidence on the effectiveness of specific interventions in \ntackling inequalities in the public health priority conditions we examined. Our proposals are therefore \nbased on extrapolation from general population health effects. Extensive, specific and robust \nevidence is urgently needed to guide policy and programmes. In the meantime, we believe our \nproposals provide a reasonably sound and pragmatic basis for an evidence-based approach.  \n \n243 words  \n \n \n3 \n \nBACKGROUND \nThe Commission on the Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) was set up by the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) in 2005 and reported in 2008. [1] It documented the social determinants of \nhealth, how these vary globally, and it examined the evidence on what can be done to promote health \nequity both between social groups within countries (e.g. reduce health inequalities by socio-economic \nstatus) and between countries (e.g. reducing global health inequalities in life expectancy). It was also \nintended to \u201cfoster a global movement\u201d to achieve social justice in health (2008: iii). [1] The 2008 \nreport made three major (and broad) proposals on how to enhance health equity: 1. Improve daily \nliving conditions; 2. Tackle the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources; 3. Measure \nand understand the problem and assess the impact of action.[1] The report received a lot of attention \nworldwide and in some countries significant political support was received for the broad \nrecommendations from government or opposition political parties. [2] For example, in India,  Norway \nand Denmark, country-specific commissions have been or are beingset up to find evidence-based \nways of putting the WHO recommendations into action and implementing effective policies to reduce \nhealth inequalities in these specific locations.  \n \nIn England, Professor Sir Michael Marmot was asked by the Secretary of State for Health to chair an \nindependent review to advise on the most effective strategies for reducing health inequalities in \nEngland from 2010. In this Review, he was asked to take into account the best global evidence \nappropriate to England from the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health and other \nwork over the past ten years. The Review Team was asked to liaise with the Department of Health \nand national and local stakeholders and work to timeframes of what can be achieved in the short to \nmedium and longer term. The Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England Post 2010 (Marmot \nReview) will report to the Department of Health by the end of 2009 and the final report will be \npublished early in 2010. The overall aim of the review is to \u201cTo advise the Secretary of State for \nHealth on the future development of a health inequalities strategy by taking into account the best \nglobal evidence appropriate to England from the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of \nHealth, and the work of the last 10 years.\u201d [3] The first phase of the Review\u201fs work (January to June \n2009) was to examine the evidence base about the causes of health inequalities and about the \nsuccess of interventions and policies to tackle them which have been implemented in England and \n4 \n \ninternationally. To do this, The Review team commissioned nine task groups to examine the \nintervention evidence on the various social determinants of health inequalities (see Box 1).In this \npaper we present an overview of the findings of the task group which focused on inequalities in a \nlimited number of priority \u201epublic health conditions\u201f: the big causes of premature death (cardiovascular \ndisease and cancer); obesity; and other big public health burdens such as risk-taking behaviors in \nyounger adults (alcohol, drugs, violence), mental ill-health throughout life, and the threats to wellbeing \nin older people.  In order to determine the priority public health conditions to be considered, the \ncommissioning paper from the Marmot Secretariat proposed some broad areas and examples to the \nTask Group. The initial meeting(s) of the Task Group discussed and refined the areas for review and \nthen commissioned research into those areas that confirmed\/amended the example conditions.  The \ntask group reviewed new and emerging evidence on the effects of particular policies, strategies, \nstructures and interventions on reducing inequalities in these conditions, with a particular focus on the \nsocial determinants. On the basis of the evidence we collated and interpreted, we drafted five key \nproposals (with nine secondary proposals) on what we consider to be plausible policy directions and \nchanges in practice. We also drafted a research proposal. The summary of evidence included in this \npaper is by nature brief and the full review is accessible online.[4] \n \nInequalities in the priority public health conditions \nHealth inequalities are defined as systematic differences between and within populations by \nsocioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender and age.  In this paper we will concentrate on socio-economic \ndifferences in health although as Graham and Kelly (2004) observe these axes of differentiation often \ninterlock and disadvantage tends to accumulate over the life course [5].  Further, socio-economic \nstatus is known to be reflective of a range of other disadvantages including low education, lack of \npower and resources and marginalisation\/social exclusion [1].  \u2013Health inequalities are particularly \npronounced for priority public health conditions, such as certain cancers; cardiovascular disease; \nobesity and public health burdens such as mental ill-health; health and wellbeing in older people and \nrisky health behaviours (injuries, violence, alcohol and substance misuse).   \nCardiovascular Disease and Cancer  \nMortality and morbidity from CVD and cancer are unevenly distributed across society with a \ndisproportionate burden in low-income groups: recent data indicate that there are 2.7 times more CVD \n5 \n \ndeaths among men in the most deprived twentieth compared with the least deprived twentieth of the \npopulation.[7] Similarly, socioeconomic status was shown to be related to lung cancer incidence, with \npeople with low levels of education having a higher incidence of cancer.[8] Modifiable risk factors for \nCVD and cancers, such as smoking, physical inactivity, excess alcohol consumption or obesity, are \nalso elevated in these population groups.[7] Indeed, there are commonalities in terms of the \npatterning of risk factors across other chronic conditions with smoking, consumption of unhealthy \nfoods and physical inactivity also being associated with both diabetes and obesity.  In high-income \ncountries, while the overall prevalence of some risk factors have been decreasing (such as smoking), \ninequalities have been widening. [9] \n \nObesity \nObesity is a cause of several chronic diseases including diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, \nhypertension, osteoarthritis and certain forms of cancer. [10]  Obesity is associated with social and \neconomic deprivation across all age ranges and recent research suggests that this gradient is \nembedded with little evidence of change over time. [11]   \n \nRisky health behaviours (Alcohol, Drugs, Injuries and Violence) \nIn England, as with other high income countries, hospital admission for alcohol-specific conditions is \nassociated with increased levels of deprivation, with rates of admission for the most deprived quintiles \nbeing particularly high. [15] The links between drug use and social and economic inequalities are well \nrecognised as there is a significant positive correlation between the prevalence of problematic drug \nusers and area level deprivation. Similarly, admission rates for drug-specific conditions show a strong \npositive association with deprivation. [16] The burden of injuries and violence in the UK is not equally \ndistributed across the population, and in general, there are higher rates of injuries and violence \namong individuals with a lower socioeconomic status [17, 18].  \n \nMental Health \nConsistent associations have been found between mental ill health and various markers of social and \neconomic adversity [20] The social gradient is particularly pronounced for severe mental illness, with \nthe prevalence of psychotic disorders the prevalence amongst the lowest quintile of household \n6 \n \nincome being nine times higher than in the highest. [21] Similarly, the social gradient is also evident \nfor common mental health problems, with a two-fold variation between the highest and lowest \nquintiles. [21] Poor mental health also increases the incidence of and worsens the prognosis for a \nwide range of physical health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and \nasthma and is associated with a variety of risk factors such as smoking, drug use, alcohol abuse and \nobesity.  Likewise, depression can be caused by physical health conditions (e.g. depression is an \neffect of chronic pain) [Bair, 2003].  It is therefore also important to consider the role of mental health \nand well-being when tackling inequalities across all priority public health conditions. \n \nHealth and Wellbeing of Older People \nApproximately one in five older people in the UK live in poverty. [22] There are significant health \ninequalities amongst older people with those in the lowest quintile of income reporting poorer general \nhealth, lower levels of fruit and vegetable consumption and higher degrees of mobility problems. [23] \nSimilarly, the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease amongst older people is higher in the most \ndeprived areas. Diabetes prevalence and uncontrolled hypertension are also inversely related to \nincome. [23]  \n \nPublic policy and health inequalities  \nPolicy approaches to addressing these health inequalities fall into three broad but interlinked \ncategories: (1) improving the health of the most disadvantaged groups by concentrating on absolute \nlevels of health; (2) reducing the gap between the best and worst off, by implementing interventions \ntargeted towards those people with the greatest burden of disadvantage; (3) improving health across \nthe whole social gradient. [5] Over the past 30 years, there have been a number of strategies \nproposed to tackle health inequalities in England; particularly in respect to priority health conditions \n(see Figure 1). However, they have all largely focused on either (1) improving the health of the most \ndeprived groups, (2) narrowing the gap or (3) universal health improvements .  \n \nAdditionally, policy has tended to focus on downstream interventions such as smoking cessation \nservices rather than tackling upstream, distal causes such as poor living conditions. This approach is \nin contrast to a wide body of epidemiological and sociological work which suggests that health \n7 \n \ninequalities are likely to persist between socioeconomic groups even if lifestyle factors (such as \nsmoking) are equalised (Health Select Committee, 2009: paragraph 47). [24] Indeed, Phelan et al \n(2004) suggest that the only way to achieve lasting reductions in inequality is to address society\u201fs \nimbalances with regard to power, income, social support and knowledge. [25]   In addition, there is \nevidence that educational and other individual based approaches tend to be taken up \ndisproportionately by the more affluent and so also tend to widen inequalities even if average health \nimproves [26].  However, the evidence base is not at all conclusive on what levels of approaches work \nto reduce inequalities and whether upstream, downstream, targeted or universal are most effective.  \n \n \nMETHODS A series of rapid (non-systematic) narrative literature reviews of the policy relevant \ninternational evidence base was undertaken.  Due to time and resource constraints the practice of \nconducting a traditional systematic review was precluded.  Drawing on the principles of systematic \nreviews we, therefore, developed a methodology to identify, appraise and synthesise key policy ready \nevidence (i.e. review level) within a very short timeframe to feed directly into policymaking. This \nprocess involved the development of a new and pragmatic method with 5 different steps as outlined in \nfigure 1.   \n \nThe first two stages comprised a rapid search of the literature.  Drawing on the principles of \nsystematic review methodology, it was important here to establish the boundaries of the search by \nidentifying the population, types of intervention and outcomes of interest.  Quantitative studies of any \ndesign which looked at the effects on health inequalities, the social gradient or overall population \nhealth effects, of interventions designed to address the social determinants of public health priority \nconditions were examined.  We focused on \u201cnew evidence\u201d \u2013 that is studies published since the 1998 \nAcheson Report. [27]   Text Box 2 contains an example of this process for the mental health strand of \nthe task group.   \n \nAfter conducting the searches the papers selected were appraised to draw out relevance in relation to \nthe question of interest (i.e. what interventions work to reduce inequalities in the priority conditions).  \nAny identified new or underexploited evidence was discussed with task group members and using an \n8 \n \niterative process of consensus building a list of proposed recommendations was formulated.  The key \nrecommendations from each strand were taken forward and amalgamated into a larger list which was \nthen prioritised through further group discussions taking into account three competing but equally \nimportant considerations: \n (i) epidemiological evidence of what works to reduce inequalities in each priority condition; \n (ii) evidence of cost effectiveness for the proposed interventions; \n (iii) evidence on implementation and delivery of interventions.     \n9 \n \nFigure 1: Phases involved in the formulation of recommendations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBox 2: Example of stages 1 & 2, (boundary setting and identification) from the mental health strand \n \nStage 1. Identification of key areas to focus on (childhood mental health; mental and physical health; \nemployment and mental health) - this was done by consulting the research and policy teams within \nthe Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health (SCMH) as well as expert contacts outside SCMH.  The \ncriteria used to select the areas were: (1) the existence of evidence implicating the area in the \ngeneration and maintenance of health inequalities; (2) the availability of interventions allowing this link \nwith health inequalities to be weakened or broken; (3) the existence of a strong evidence base to \nsupport the use of these interventions. \n  \nStage 2. Identification of evidence \u2013 key word searches were conducted using PubMed to identify \nrelevant literature within each of the three areas.  UK evidence was prioritised where available, but \ninternational evidence was also drawn upon.  We also examined articles cited in the original CSDH \nreport, and other recent, high-profile reports such as the Foresight report on Mental Capital and \nWellbeing. \n \n \n \nStage 1: Boundary setting - definition of the parameters of \nthe searches \nStage 2: Identification of evidence - conduct searches \nusing a small number of key words which reflect the \npopulation, intervention and outcome of interest across \none or two key search engines (e.g Web of Science and \nMedline).  Restrict searches by date and to accessible and \npolicy ready evidence  i.e. systematic reviews & umbrella \nreviews (use as key words) \n \nStage 3: Appraise evidence and draw out relevance with \nrespect to the policy related question of interest \nStage 4: With the Task Group Lead and other members \ndevelop and refine key recommendations  \nStage 5: Feed recommendations into the policy process \n(i.e. report back to Marmot Secretariat) with \nrecommendations and accompanying justification \n10 \n \nRESULTS: EVIDENCE BASED PROPOSALS  \nOur proposals to the Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England post-2010 (the Marmot \nReview)  for tackling inequalities in priority public health conditions are necessarily wide-ranging, \nreflecting the fact that the causes of health inequalities are complex. [24] We acknowledge that an \neffective strategy to improve health across the population, and to reduce health inequalities, is to \nimplement upstream policy interventions that reach across sectors and create an environment \n(economic, social, cultural and physical) that fosters healthy living. However, these need to be \nsupported by downstream socially-targeted interventions to mitigate any adverse distributional \nconsequences. We have therefore proposed a mix of both upstream and downstream solutions. In \nmany cases these build on initiatives that have already started (and need to be continued) or on pilots \nthat would need to be scaled-up to have a significant impact on the social gradient.  Below we present \nthe five key proposals made to the Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England post-2010 (the \nMarmot Review) and the supporting evidence upon which they are based. We also present the \nresearch proposal. The supporting evidence for the nine secondary proposals is presented in web \nappendix 1. Proposals in the latter category are those which overlap with the proposals of the other \neight Marmot review task groups. The full list of  proposals is presented in Figure 2.  \n \nProposal 1: Reduce smoking in the most deprived groups by focusing on price and \navailability, while providing stop smoking services targeted to help the poorest groups quit. \nSmoking accounts for around half the difference in life expectancy between the lowest and highest \nincome groups, and smoking-related death rates are two to three times higher among disadvantaged \nsocial groups than among the better off. [7] [28] Tobacco control is therefore central to any strategy to \ntackle health inequalities and to any prevention strategy. Increasing the price of smoking is the most \neffective means of helping smokers quit. However, tobacco tax is strongly regressive and for those \nsmokers who do not quit it can increase health inequalities, particularly for less affluent smokers.  On \nthe other hand, real price increases do help lead some smokers to quit and make very substantial \nhealth and welfare gains for those that do quit.  This poses a dilemma, which can be resolved only by \nmaking the greatest possible efforts to motivate and assist smokers to quit in response to increases in \ntaxation.  This would include greater emphasis in smoking cessation initiatives on the psychosocial \nreasons for smoking.  Preventing people from starting to smoke or helping them quit requires \n11 \n \nmeasures at population level that impact on all the key levers: price, promotion, place and product, \nalso known as the marketing mix. [29] \n \nProposal 2: Improve availability of and access to healthier food choices amongst low income \ngroups  \nThere is a clear gradient in the consumption of fruit and vegetables per day with quintile of household \nincome, the lowest consumption being in the lowest income group. [4] Low income groups are less \nlikely to consume five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, and more likely to consume fat spreads, \nnon-diet soft drinks, meat and meat dishes, pizza, processed meats, whole milk and table sugar. [30] \nA survey by the National Consumer Council found that the formulation of various types of food tended \nto be less \u201ehealthy\u201f for the economy lines, cheaper foods for example having higher salt or fat content. \n[31]  \n \nProposal 3: Improve the early detection and treatment of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular \ndisease, especially among the more susceptible groups. \nSocioeconomic deprivation is a strong predictor of screening participation with expression of interest \nin colorectal screening and attendance at the test being lower in deprived groups. [32] Similar findings \nare reported for breast and cervical screening. [33]   Evidence suggests that people from lower socio-\neconomic groups have their cancer diagnosed at a later stage which subsequently affects treatment \noptions and prognosis. [34] With regard to vascular checks, a recent systematic review has found \nstrong socioeconomic and ethnic gradients in uptake of invitations for CVD screening. [35]  \n \nProposal 4: Introduce a minimum price per unit for alcohol.  \nA systematic review of 112 studies examining the relationship between prices of alcohol and alcohol \nsales\/self-reported drinking concluded there was a large body of evidence indicating an inverse \nrelationship between alcohol prices and taxes, and drinking. [36] Furthermore in comparison to other \nprevention policies and programmes, policies which raised prices of alcohol were an effective method \nof reducing consumption. [36] Given the social patterning of alcohol consumption, banning cheap \nalcohol by introducing a mandatory minimum price per unit of alcohol may disproportionately benefit \nlower socio-economic groups. [37]  \n12 \n \n \nProposal 5: Improve physical healthcare for people with mental heath problems and mental \nhealthcare for people with physical health problems.   \nMental and physical wellbeing are closely interrelated, with higher rates of coronary heart disease, \nstroke, cancer, diabetes, infections, injuries and asthma amongst people with poor mental health. [38-\n40] People with a diagnosis of mental illness receive poor quality treatment for physical health \nproblems and are rarely targeted for health promotion initiatives e.g. smoking cessation, healthy \neating or exercise. [41] Conversely, people with other priority public health conditions such as \ndiabetes and cancer are more likely to develop mental health problems. [42-44] The interface \nbetween primary and secondary care is particularly important in terms of improving healthcare for \npeople with co-morbidities. [41] [45] \n \nResearch Proposal: Fund more studies which examine the impacts of interventions on socio-\neconomic health inequalities.  \nWhilst there is often evidence of the general health effects of interventions, there is a dearth of \nevidence in respect of the impacts and cost-effectiveness of interventions on health inequalities. As a \nrecent report shows, this is the case in terms of both primary studies and systematic reviews. [46] [47] \nSimilarly, more research has been conducted on the effects on health inequalities of downstream \ninterventions, as opposed to upstream interventions. The recent English Parliament Health Select \nCommittee report on health inequalities (2009) also made it clear that the lack of evidence and \nevaluation of current policies makes it difficult to address health inequalities effectively. [24] While this \nis not an argument for doing nothing, it points to the need for a more systematic approach to building \nthe evidence base in undertaking interventions, described in our earlier proposals, that are \nextrapolated from general population health effects. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nMain findings of this study \nThere are four unifying themes within our total set of 15  proposals: (1) The importance of improving \nthe physical, social and economic environment of deprived areas (e.g. improving access to healthy \n13 \n \nfoods, providing safe places for physical activity, improving the quality of housing, or increasing the \nlevel of employment). (2) The long-term public health benefits of intervening early in the life-course to \nprevent the development of risky health behaviours or chronic conditions (e.g. childhood socialisation \nschemes to reduce violence; improved infant and maternal health and nutrition). (3) The importance \nof considering the close interplay between physical and mental health when designing strategies to \nreduce health inequalities. (4) The use of fiscal and financial policy instruments to enable deprived \npopulations to live healthier lives (e.g. cigarette pricing, minimum price for alcohol, financial incentives \nto reduce drug dependence, or a minimum income for healthy living).    \n \nWhat is already known on this topic \nThere is a dearth of policy ready evidence available on what types of approaches work to reduce \ninequalities.  Further, there is far more evaluation evidence of downstream interventions than there is \nof upstream interventions. This is despite the well-acknowledged importance of upstream \ninterventions in reducing health inequalities. [25] This may reflect the fact that, in the past, \ndownstream (e.g. lifestyle) interventions have been easier to identify, implement and evaluate.  \n \nWhat this study adds \nThe study contributes to the knowledge base in two key ways: (i) the development of new methods for \nconducting rapid reviews to identify relevant and accessible evidence within a limited timeframe to \nfeed into policy-making; (ii) the formulation of recommendations to tackle persistent inequalities in \npriority public health conditions using new or under exploited evidence.  In terms of existing public \nhealth policy reports, this review aligns, reinforces and extends some of the findings of Black (1980) \nand Acheson (1998) (e.g. the need to reduce poverty and income inequalities in Black and Acheson \nrespectively and the call for a minimum income for health living in older people proposed in this \nreview, (Proposal 15)) but rather than being viewed as duplication, these findings should be framed \nas a call for further action to address embedded and socially unjust patterns of health inequality.  In \naddition, the recommendations attempted to capture the inter-relationships between certain public \nhealth conditions.  One example is the recommendation to strengthen the links between physical and \nmental ill health (Proposal 5).   \n \n14 \n \nLimitations of this study \nWhile we have attempted to summarise all relevant new or underused research evidence on how to \ntackle inequalities in priority public health conditions, each of the searches were undertaken using \nrapid review techniques.  This in itself represents a new development in relation to identifying \naccessible, policy relevant evidence within a short timeframe for use in developing recommendations \nfor policymakers.  However, despite drawing on the principles of systematic review methodology the \nreview is for obvious reasons not exhaustive and we cannot claim to have identified, appraised and \nsynthesized all relevant evidence in the topic area.  \n      \nCONCLUSION \nThe process of formulating recommendations for policy making is inherently complex and involves \nreconciling a number of competing and often conflicting factors.  For example, the use of fiscal \npolicies such as the minimum price per unit for alcohol - which might be experienced as \ndisempowering by disadvantaged groups - is at odds with the aim of reducing power, income and \nresource imbalances among populations.  These underpinning tensions were compounded by the \nlack of evidence on effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of what types of societal level interventions \nwork to reduce inequalities. Our research proposal, therefore, contains the suggestion that in the \nfuture, more evaluations of upstream interventions need to be conducted and funded.   \n \nAdditionally, our research proposal suggests that all future evaluations of public health interventions \nshould incorporate a health inequalities dimension. This is because in all of the priority health \nconditions covered by the task group there was a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of \ninterventions in tackling health inequalities between groups, as opposed to a general improvement in \npopulation health. [46, 47]. Our policy proposals are therefore based on extrapolation from this \ngeneral population health evidence as it is all that is available.  Implicitly, we have been guided by the \nassumption that as the burden of public health priority conditions disproportionately falls upon lower \nsocioeconomic groups, interventions which have been shown to be generally effective in preventing \nor treating these conditions could, if targeted at deprived groups or areas, be effective in reducing \nhealth inequalities. We admit that this is not ideal. However, until an extensive and robust evidence \n15 \n \nbase is developed on the effects of interventions which reduce inequalities, we believe our proposals \nprovide a reasonably sound and pragmatic basis for an evidence-based approach [1, 48].  \n \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe are grateful to the following people who submitted evidence to the task group: Deborah Arnott \n(Action on Smoking & Health); Andy Bell (Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health); Simon Capewell \n(University of Liverpool); Andy Cassels-Brown (Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust); Alan Dangour, \nChristopher Deeming, Jerry Morris and Paul Wilkinson (London School of Hygiene and Tropical \nMedicine); Gill Elliot (Liverpool John Moores University); Melvyn Hillsdon (University of Bristol); Sian \nHiom (Cancer Research UK); Alyson Jones (Liverpool John Moores University); Jane Landon \n(National Heart Forum); Elaine Murphy (House of Lords); Michael Parsonage (Sainsbury Centre for \nMental Health); Kiran Patel (South Asian Health Foundation); Mike Richards and Kathy Elliott \n(National Cancer Support Team); Alex Scott-Samuel (University of Liverpool); Linda Seymour \n(Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health); Claire Shaw (Liverpool John Moores University); Karen Tocque \n(Liverpool John Moores University); M.

Neither the proposals \nmade by the task group nor the commentary and opinions expressed in this paper represent the \nviews, conclusions or recommendations of the Marmot Review or of the Department of Health.  \n \nPolicy Implications  \n \n Public policy needs to focus on improving the physical, social and economic environment \nof deprived areas (e.g. improving access to high nutrient foods, providing safe places for \nphysical activity, improving the quality of housing, or increasing the level of employment). \n There are long-term public health benefits of intervening early in the life-course to \nprevent the development of risky health behaviours or chronic conditions (e.g. childhood \nsocialisation schemes to reduce violence; improved infant and maternal health and \nnutrition).  \n The close interplay between physical and mental health needs to be considered when \ndesigning strategies to reduce health inequalities.  \n Fiscal and financial policy instruments should be used to enable deprived populations to \nlive healthier lives (e.g. cigarette pricing, minimum price for alcohol, financial incentives \nto reduce drug dependence, or a minimum income for healthy living).    \n16 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nLynch, J., Davey Smith, G., Harper, S. and Bainbridge, K.
