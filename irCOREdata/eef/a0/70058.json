They appear to\nbe mainly driven by SO2 gas along with minor concentra-\ntions of sulfur and probably other sulfur compounds [Smith\net al., 1979; McEwen and Soderblom, 1983; Johnson et al.,\n1995; Lopes-Gautier et al., 2000]. The instruments aboard\nthe Galileo spacecraft have confirmed the existence of SO2\nwithin both the Pillan and Pele plumes [McEwen et al.,\n1998a] which are the subjects of this investigation (Figures\n1a and 1b). Recently, sulfur dioxide deposits have been\nmapped at scales of less than 10 km, revealing a more\ncomplex relationship to surface colors, and some red areas,\npreviously thought to be depleted in SO2, now reveal its\nexistence [Lopes-Gautier et al., 2000]. After the 5 month-\nlong eruption at Pillan first imaged on 28 June 1997, a new\n400 km diameter circular plume fall deposit, dark at all\nobserved wavelengths, formed around Pillan Patera [McE-\nwen et al., 1998a]. This deposit appears to be similar to the\ndark fan-shaped deposit, 200 km in radial extent, extending\noutward from the Pele volcanic center [Strom and Schneider,\n1982]. Further away from the Pele vent, red annular deposits\nare found, whereas no evidence for surface condensates is\nseen at Pillan [McEwen et al., 1998a]. However, a process of\nSO2 condensation within the Pillan plume has been sug-\ngested by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based\nobservations [Spencer et al., 1997a].\n[3] Conversion of atmospheric water vapor to liquid drop-\nlets or hailstones, micrometer to submillimeter in size, is an\nimportant process in terrestrial volcanic plumes [Rogers and\nYau, 1989]. Available ash particles or particle aggregates act\nas condensation nuclei and may spend a substantial part of\ntheir airborne lifetime coated with liquid or solid condensate\n[Gilbert and Lane, 1994]. The occurrence of liquid water at\nlow relative humidities and at temperatures less than 0\u0001C is\nprobably due to the presence of sulfuric acid [Ammann and\nBurtscher, 1993]. The covering of particles or particle\naggregates by ice occurs when they are convected upwards\nthrough the atmosphere to very-low-temperature regions.\n[4] Evidence for condensates on individual glassy vol-\ncanic particles was also found in some lunar soils sampled\nduring two lunar Apollo missions (15 and 17). These soils\nwere dominated by droplets of volcanic glass, averaging\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 107, NO.

Various volatile elements (e.g., Zn, Ga, Pb, Cu,\nTl, S, F, and Cl) appeared to be concentrated in surficial\ndeposits on both the Apollo 15 and 17 glass spherules\n[Gibson and Moore, 1973a, 1973b; Chou et al., 1975;\nMeyer et al., 1975; Wasson et al., 1976; Butler, 1978].\nThe same authors concluded that these elements condensed\non the outside surface of the glassy particles in lava\nfountains.\n[5] Previous models of explosive volcanic eruptions on\nIo, although addressing many aspects of the fluid mechan-\nics of the discharge of gas or gas\u2013particle mixtures into a\nvacuum [e.g., Cook et al., 1979; Smith et al., 1979; Strom\net al., 1979; Collins, 1981; Wilson and Head, 1981a;\n2001; Kieffer, 1982, 1984; Strom and Schneider, 1982;\nJames and Wilson, 1998; Cataldo and Wilson, 2000;\nKieffer et al., 2000; Glaze and Baloga, 2000], have\ngenerally not dealt in great detail with the dynamic\ninteractions between volatiles and pyroclasts. Here we\npresent a simple fluid-dynamic and thermodynamic model\nof explosive volcanic eruptions on Io which includes such\ninteractions, and in which the eruption conditions are\nconstrained by considering the distances from the vent at\nwhich SO2 gas in plumes is deposited directly as a solid\nonto the ground.\n2. Model Assumptions and Initial Conditions\n2.1. Steady Eruptions of Gas and Magma\n[6] We start by considering steady eruptions of gas and\nmagma at the Pillan and Pele sites, both locations being\nassociated with very-high-temperature hot spots [McEwen\net al., 1998b]. The steady assumption is justified by the\nduration, at least a few months, of most volcanic events\nobserved by both the Voyager and Galileo imaging\nsystems [Strom and Schneider, 1982; McEwen et al.,\n1998a]. The earliest stages of an eruption on Io are likely\nto involve choked flow, in which the conduit near the\nsurface does not flare sufficiently rapidly to allow a\ntransition from subsonic to supersonic flow to occur\nbelow the surface [Kieffer, 1982]. The exit pressure at\nthe surface vent is much greater than the ambient pressure\n(a near-vacuum on Io, no more than 10\u00021 Pa near plumes\nand 10\u00023 Pa elsewhere) [Lellouche, 1996; Spencer et al.,\n2000], the eruption speed is limited to be equal to the\nspeed of sound in the mixture of gas and particles exiting\nthe vent, and a system of shocks in and above the vent\nallows the pressure to decrease and the magma eruption\nspeed to increase to equilibrium values [Kieffer, 1984].\nHowever, accumulation of pyroclasts around the vent and\nerosion of the vent walls may together allow the vent\nshape to adjust itself toward that of a De Lavalle nozzle,\nthe profile of which allows a smooth transition to pressure\nbalanced flow [Wilson and Head, 1981b], i.e., flow in\nwhich the pressure at any given depth is not too greatly\ndifferent from the lithostatic pressure in the crustal rocks,\nso that there are minimal stresses across the walls of the\nconduit. This process is most likely to occur in a long-\nlived eruption, and would lead to pyroclasts leaving the\nvent region with a wide range of elevation angles, from\n90\u0001 (vertical) to 45\u0001 (leading to the maximum range if\nplanetary surface curvature is neglected) to some small\nvalue dictated by the exact vent geometry. We assume\nthat this wide range of elevations is present in the\neruptions we model and, for simplicity, also assume that\nequal numbers of pyroclasts are ejected at all elevations\nand azimuths.\n2.2. Interaction Between Magma and Liquid SO2\nat Shallow Depths\n[7] The erupting magma, with a maximum temperature\nup to 1900 K, consistent with Galileo hot spot data\n[McEwen et al., 1998a, 1998b], is assumed to interact with\nSO2, which will become a liquid at the temperature and\npressure relevant to a depth of 1.75 km and a supercritical\nfluid at depths greater than \u00032 km (see phase diagram in the\nwork of Kieffer et al. [2000]). Such an assumption is\nconsistent with current models of the Ionian crust, which\nfavor a silicate makeup with a substantial amount of SO2\ndeposits concentrated at its uppermost layers [Keszthelyi\nand McEwen, 1997; Kieffer et al., 2000]. We start from the\nWohletz [1986] approach to magma\u2013water interactions, in\nwhich magma and external water are allowed to mix\nintimately and come close to thermal equilibrium before\nFigure 1. (a) Galileo SSI image of the Pillan eruption plume. Image width is 645 km (frame\n401863203, violet filter, orbit C9, 28 July 1997, resolution 12 km pixel\u00021).

During a steady\neruption, the injection of a volatile liquid from an aquifer\nthrough the conduit walls will occur over a finite range of\ndepths. Intimate mingling, which will be most effective after\nthe magma has disrupted into liquid droplets entrained in\nthe gas stream, will bring the system to a thermal and\ndynamic equilibrium. Assuming that all of the liquid is\nvaporized, the redistribution of thermal energy as the\nmagma cools and the entrained SO2 is converted to vapor\nand heated leads to:\n1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de Tmi \u0002 T\u00f0 \u00deCm \u00bc n Ls \u00fe Tb \u0002 T1\u00f0 \u00deCs1\u00bd \t \u00fe T\u0002 Tb\u00f0 \u00deCsv;\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere n is the mass fraction of liquid SO2 added to the\nmagma, Tmi is the initial magma temperature, T is the\nequilibrium temperature after mixing, Cm is the specific heat\nof the magma, Ls and Tb are the latent heat of vaporization\nand the boiling point of SO2 (262.4 K), respectively, Tl is\nthe temperature of the SO2 liquid (taken as 200 K), and Csl\nand Csv are the specific heats of liquid and gaseous SO2,\nrespectively. The relationship thus obtained relates the SO2\nmass fraction and temperature of the mixture of magma and\nSO2 emerging from the vent: the higher the mass proportion\nof incorporated SO2 (we assume that values up to at least 30\nmass % are possible), the lower the temperature.\n2.3. The Optically Thick Portions of the Plumes\n[8] We assume that a zone exists, extending a few kilo-\nmeters radially outward from the Pillan and Pele vents,\nwithin which the number density of magma droplets\/pyro-\nclasts is so high that the plume is optically dense (i.e.,\nopaque to the transmission of thermal radiation) [Wilson\nand Head, 1981b]. Essentially zero heat is lost, thus\nbuffering the temperature, while the pressure varies in\naccordance with a continuity equation. We cannot observe\nthis region directly at Pele or Pillan because no suitably\noriented images of the plumes were obtained at high enough\nspatial resolution (Pillan has not been active since Novem-\nber 1997 and limb images taken by Galileo prior to this\nhave resolutions no better than \u00038 km pixel\u00021 [McEwen et\nal., 1997b]; similarly the best limb images of Pele have\nresolutions ranging from 7 km pixel\u00021 (Voyager images)\n[Strom et al., 1979] to \u000314 km pixel\u00021 (Galileo) [Davies et\nal., 2001]). However, the assumption now seems to be\nsupported by some very-high-resolution (<1 km) images\nof an eruption issuing from a fissure vent in one of the\ncalderas of the Tvashtar Catena complex, where fountains\nof red hot materials (extending 2000 m outwards) were\ninferred after correction of a partially overexposed image\n[McEwen et al., 2000]. These fountains have been success-\nfully modeled as representing just such an optically dense\nparticle cloud [Wilson and Head, 2001].\n[9] The relationship between gas pressures and velocities\ndescribing the variation in kinetic energy resulting from a\ngiven amount of near-isothermal gas expansion [Wilson,\n1980] is given by:\nu2f =2 \u00bc u2i =2\u00fe n Q Ti\u00f0 \u00de=m\u00bd \t ln Pi=Pf\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de=s1; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere uf is the final velocity of the gas\u2013magma mixture; ui\nthe initial velocity of the gas\u2013magma mixture; Pf the final\npressure; Pi the initial pressure; Ti the initial temperature of\nthe gas\u2013magma mixture, which is assumed constant over\nthe optically thick region; sl the density of magma\ndroplets; n the mass fraction of incorporated gaseous\nSO2, Q the universal gas constant, and m the molecular\nweight of the gas.\n[10] Pressure varies as a result of volume variations alone,\nbecause the temperature is assumed constant, at Ti, in this\nregion. We therefore relate the gas pressure to the volume,\nand hence the density, using the perfect gas law. We also\nrelate increasing radial distances from the vent with decreas-\ning bulk densities and increasing velocities according to the\nexpression:\nRf \u00bc Ri bi ui\u00f0 \u00de= bf uf\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t1=2; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Rf is the final distance from the vent; Ri the initial\ndistance from the vent; bf the final bulk density and bi the\ninitial bulk density. This relationship is obtained from the\ngeneral expression for the constant erupted mass flux,\nwhich is given by M = (b u A), where, in our specific case,\nA = (2 p R2), the surface area of the hemispherical envelope\noccupied by the erupting gas\u2013magma mixture.\n[11] The bulk density of the gas\u2013magma mixture exiting\nthe vent is given by:\nb \u00bc n=r\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de=s1\u00bd \t\u00021; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere r is the density of the gas phase, a function of\npressure and temperature, and s1, the density of the magma\ndroplets, is taken as 2600 kg m\u00023, a value appropriate to a\nliquid basaltic composition. The final expression for the\nmass flux is then:\nM \u00bc n=r\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de=s1\u00bd \t\u00021u 2 p R2\n\u0001 \u0002\n: \u00f05\u00de\n[12] We next define the opacity depth of the Pillan and\nPele volcanic plumes. This represents the radial extent of\nthe plume through which radiation can partly penetrate\nbecause the plume is neither completely opaque nor\noptically thin. The general expression for the opacity depth\n\u0003 of a particle\u2013gas mixture [Wilson and Keil, 1997] is\ngiven by:\n\u0003 \u00bc 4 S3=G p f2; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere S is the mean spacing between magma droplets\/\npyroclasts, f is the mean diameter of droplets\/pyroclasts,\nand G is a correction factor to account for the fact that a\nrange of droplet sizes is probably present within eruption\nplumes. The optically thick region is unresolvable with\ncurrent imagery and, as a consequence, we cannot exclude\nthe possibility of a wide range of droplet sizes. Wilson and\nHead [1981b] modeled the lunar volcanic droplet size\ndistribution using a logarithmic law. We adopt f = 10 mm\nas our initial estimate of the mean droplet size (and will\nshow later that this is a reasonable assumption) and take G\nas 1.5, which implies that magmatic droplets can range\nbetween 1 and 100 mm in diameter (see derivation by\nWilson and Keil [1997]). The very small sizes would result\nCATALDO ET AL.: VOLCANIC PLUME ERUPTION RATES ON IO 19 - 3\nfrom efficient melt disruption, similar to that which occurred\non the Moon in eruptions into a vacuum [Wilson and Head,\n1981b], and the low terminal fall velocity of the pyroclasts\nwould cause them to be carried initially at essentially the\nsame speed as the expanding and accelerating gas. Also,\nmagma\u2013SO2 interactions would be expected to enhance the\ndisruption process. The assumed droplet\/pyroclast sizes are\nbigger by a factor of 100 than those inferred at the\nuppermost portions of the Pillan and Pele plumes through\nboth Galileo and HST observations [McEwen et al., 1997a;\nSpencer et al., 1997a, 1997b]. Eruptions of gas and magma\ndroplets in a near-vacuum environment would probably\ncontribute to making magmatic droplets smaller, as a result\nof a greater gas expansion once the erupted mixture exits the\nvolcanic vent. We demonstrate later the consequences of\nassuming other droplet sizes.\n[13] No temperature, pressure, or density terms appear in\nequation (6). For our purpose we need an equation in which\nat least one of these terms is involved. The volume of a single\nmagmatic droplet is given by [(4\/3)p(f\/2)3] = [(pf3)\/6]. The\nnumber density of magma particles within the volcanic\nplume can be found from:\n1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00deb \u00bc 1=S3\u0001 \u0002 p f3\u0001 \u0002=6\u0003 \u0004s1: \u00f07\u00de\nThe left side of this equation is the is the ratio of the total mass\nof magma to the total volume of magma plus gas. The right\nside is the same ratio expressed in terms of themass of a single\ndroplet, [(pf3)\/6]sl, and the average volume, S\n3, occupied by\nthat droplet. Substituting the expression for the bulk density\nof the gas\u2013magma mixture into equation (7) we obtain:\nS3 \u00bc p f3\u0001 \u0002=6\u0001 \u0002s1\n\u0003 \u0004\nn=r\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de=s1\u00bd \t 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de\u00021: \u00f08\u00de\nSubstituting this into the general expression for the opacity\ndepth (equation (6)), we obtain for \u0003:\n\u0003 \u00bc 2 f s1\u00f0 \u00de= 3 G 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \tf g= n=r\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 1\u0002 n\u00f0 \u00de=s1\u00bd \t: \u00f09\u00de\n[14] In the calculations we introduce the term \u2018\u2018opaque\nradius.\u2019\u2019 This defines the extent of the completely opaque\nportion of the plume. We obtain it by subtracting the opacity\ndepth value given by equation (6) from the radial extension\nof the optically thick zone outward from the vent.\n[15] Within the optically thick portion of the plume, with\nincreasing distances from the vent, gas densities and pres-\nsures continue to decrease until the flow regime changes\nand the classical treatment of particle\u2013gas drag forces can\nno longer be applied [Knudsen and Katz, 1954]. This\nhappens when the value of the mean free path l of the\ngas molecules becomes similar to the mean magma droplet\nsize. The mean free path l is given by:\nl \u00bc Q Td\u00f0 \u00de= 2 p d2 N Pd\n\u0001 \u0002\n; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere Td is the temperature of the gas\u2013magma mixture as\nparticles start to decouple from the gas; Pd is the pressure of\nthe mixture; d is the diameter of the gas molecules and N is\nAvogadro\u2019s number. Outward from the region where the\ngas\u2013magma decoupling occurs, magma particles begin to\npursue ballistic trajectories. We can calculate the velocity V0\nof the gas\u2013magma mixture when the mean free path equals\nthe mean droplet size in terms of the height of the plume:\nV0 \u00bc 2 g hm\u00f0 \u00de1=2; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere g is the acceleration due to planetary gravity and hm\nthe average height reached by the Pillan and Pele plumes\nabove the top of the optically thick region. The height of the\nPillan plume ranged from 75 to 150 km (average value\n\u0003110 km) [Spencer et al., 1997c; Strom and Schneider,\n1982], whereas the Pele plume was 280\u2013460 km high\n(average value \u0003350 km) in the Voyager and Galileo\nimages. By substituting these two values into (17), we get\nmean velocity values, V0, of \u0003600 and \u00031100 m s\u00021 at\nPillan and Pele, respectively.\n2.4. The Optically Thin Portions of the Plumes\n[16] When the mixture ceases to be optically thick,\nradiative cooling begins and subsequently both the temper-\nature and pressure decrease adiabatically, still being linked\nto the radial expansion through the continuity requirement.\nAs soon as the mean free path of the gas molecules exceeds\nthe mean particle size, the pyroclasts will decouple from the\ngas to pursue essentially ballistic trajectories [Wilson and\nKeil, 1997] back to the surface, at some maximum range.\nWithin this portion of the plume, temperatures, pressures,\nand densities of the expanding gas vary in accordance with\nan adiabatic law, and energy conservation provides final gas\nvelocities as a function of pressure variations [Wilson,\n1980]. The expression giving the kinetic energy resulting\nfrom a given amount of adiabatic gas expansion is:\nu2f =2 \u00bc u2i =2\u00fe n Q Ti\u00f0 \u00de=m\u00bd \t g= g\u0002 1\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t 1\u0002 Pf=Pi\u00f0 \u00de g= g\u00021\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t\nh i\n;\n\u00f012\u00de\nwhere uf is the final gas velocity, ui is the initial gas velocity,\nPf is the final gas pressure, Pi is the initial gas pressure, Ti is\nthe initial gas temperature, n is the mass fraction of\nincorporated liquid SO2, m is the molecular weight of SO2\ngas, g is the specific heat ratio of SO2 gas, and Q is the\nuniversal gas constant. We cannot use equation (12) directly\nin the model because our analysis starts from temperature\nvariations, whereas only pressure variations can be\nestimated from this expression. We need to find an\nexpression equivalent to the former, where temperatures\nare related to gas velocities. To do this, we combine the\nperfect gas law with the additional requirement for adiabatic\ngas expansion:\nP=rg \u00bc constant \u00f013\u00de\nto get:\nPf=Pi\u00f0 \u00de g\u00021\u00f0 \u00de=g\u00bd \t\u00bc Tf=Ti\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f014\u00de\nHence, equation (12) can also be expressed as:\nu2f =2 \u00bc u2i =2\u00fe n Q Ti\u00f0 \u00de=m\u00bd \t g= g\u0002 1\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t 1\u0002 Tf=Ti\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \t; \u00f015\u00de\nwhere Tf is the final temperature, Ti is the initial\ntemperature, uf is the final velocity, ui is the initial velocity,\n19 - 4 CATALDO ET AL.: VOLCANIC PLUME ERUPTION RATES ON IO\nand n the mass fraction of incorporated liquid SO2. This\nrepresents the new relationship between gas temperatures\nand velocities, valid in the adiabatic case. The formula\nallowing calculation of the radial distance from the vent is\nthe same as that used in the previous case (equation (3)) and\nso we can now follow the decrease in gas pressure,\ntemperature and density with increasing radial distance from\nthe vent until we reach the conditions under which solid\nSO2 begins to form.\n2.5. The Operation of the Numerical Model\n[17] In the previous sections we have described the\nphysical processes occurring as volcanic materials leave\nthe vent and travel out to the distance at which solid SO2\nformation commences. However, the implementation of the\nmodel most conveniently involves the reverse of this\nsequence, starting the solution at the observed radial\ndistances from the Pele and Pillan vents at which solid\nSO2 first forms, as evidenced by the presence of surface\nfrost.\n[18] First, the pressure and the temperature at which solid\nSO2 is expected to form on the Ionian surface are identified.\nThe surface temperature is taken as 110 K, the diurnal\naverage value, because temperatures on Io appear to range\nbetween 85 K (nighttime) and 130 K (daytime) [Belton et\nal., 1996]. Thermodynamic data show that, at 110 K, SO2\nforms a solid condensate if the pressure is close to 10\u00024 Pa\n[Kieffer, 1982; Kieffer et al., 2000]. Starting from this\ntemperature and pressure, and increasing the temperature\nin 50 K steps, conditions are followed from the outer edges\nof the Pillan and Pele plumes inward toward the vent, using\nthe various physical relationships outlined in the previous\nsections. As the radial distance from the vent decreases, the\ntemperature, pressure and density of the gas\u2013magma mix-\nture increase and the velocity decreases. The process is\nterminated when the temperature approaches 1400 K at Pele\nor 1500 K at Pillan (the highest temperatures yet inferred for\nthese vents on Io [McEwen et al., 1998a, 1998b; Davies et\nal., 2001]).\n[19] Once the SO2 condensation temperature and pressure\nconditions have been fixed, the adjustable parameters of the\nmodel are the mass flux from the vent, the mass fraction of\nSO2 in the erupting magma\u2013volatile mixture, the distance\nfrom the vent at which SO2 is first observed on the surface,\nand the clast velocity at the point where gas and clasts\ndecouple: \u0003600 m s\u00021 at Pillan and \u00031100 m s\u00021 at Pele as\njudged by the plume heights. A very wide range of mass\nfluxes was investigated, and volatile fractions ranging from\nlow magmatic values (<1 mass %) to values representing\nextreme mixing with near-vent nonjuvenile volatiles (>50\nmass %) were explored. The distances from the vents at\nwhich SO2 begins to be deposited were selected on the basis\nof the following arguments.\n[20] The Pele deposit has been consistently observed to\nextend radially outward from the vent up to 550 km [Strom\nand Schneider, 1982; McEwen et al., 2000], and bright\nannuli of SO2 frost appear to surround the volcanic center at\na comparable distance, \u0003500 km, from the central volcano.\nHowever, this cannot exclude the possibility of smaller\namounts of SO2 coverage, unresolvable in current imagery,\nat smaller distances from the vent [Carlson et al., 1997],\nand we take 250 km as a generous lower limit.\n[21] There is much more uncertainty in the case of Pillan\nabout the radial distance from the vent at which SO2\ndeposition begins. The maximum range of dark (at all\nwavelengths) deposits at Pillan is \u0003200 km (see Figures 1a\nand 1b) [McEwen et al., 1998a] and we take this to be the\nmaximum range of ballistic pyroclasts which have escaped\nbeing coated with SO2. Rather than using this value alone as\nthe distance of initial deposition, we chose to use a fairly\nwide range of values, specifically 150\u2013250 km, to assess the\nconsequences of this uncertainty.\n[22] In summary, the entire range of SO2 solid formation\ndistances seen or inferred at various times at Pillan and Pele\ncan be simulated by using the values 150 and 250 for Pillan\nand 250 and 500 km for Pele.\n3. Results\n3.1. Eruption Conditions at the Pillan\nand Pele Volcanoes\n[23] The interaction between magma and liquid SO2 at\nshallow depths leads to a large difference between the\ntemperature of the magma rising from the mantle and the\nmagma temperature on eruption. As the amount of incor-\nporated SO2 ranges from 5 to 40 mass %, eruption temper-\natures range from 1810 to 1065 K if the magma\ntemperature in the mantle is 1900 K: see Figure 2. If the\nmantle magma temperature were as high as 2100 K,\ncorresponding eruption temperatures would range from\n2010 to 1700 K. Based on a survey of the various available\ntemperature estimates for the Pillan and Pele sites [McE-\nwen et al., 1998b, 2000; Davies et al., 1999], we adopt\nvent temperatures in the range 1800\u20131900 K for Pillan and\n1300\u20131400 K for Pele, and assume that the mantle magma\ntemperature is 1900 K.

On each of these figures, a series of curves is shown\nfor mean pyroclast sizes ranging from 1 to 1000 mm; also,\nthe ranges of gas mass fractions consistent with the adopted\ntemperatures are indicated by the shaded region. The impli-\ncations are that at Pillan, the erupted mass flux lies between\n\u00031 \u0001 107 and \u00033 \u0001 107 kg s\u00021 if the condensation distance\nis 150 km and between \u00033 \u0001 107 and \u0003108 kg s\u00021 if the\ncondensation distance is 250 km. Based on our arguments in\nsection 2.5, we think that the latter distance is more\ncommonly relevant than the former, and conclude that the\naverage effusion rate probably lies within a factor of \u0003two\nof 5 \u0001 107 kg s\u00021. In the case of Pele the range of eruption\nrates is (1.2\u20131.7) \u0001 107 kg s\u00021 if the condensation distance\nis 250 km and (4.5\u20136) \u0001 107 kg s\u00021 if the condensation\ndistance is 500 km. Again the latter value seems to be the\nmore consistent with the observations discussed in section\n2.5 and so we conclude that the average mass eruption rate\nlies within perhaps 30% of 5 \u0001 107 kg s\u00021. It is extremely\ninteresting that, despite the great difference in implied\namounts of incorporated SO2, both of these eruption sites\nappear to have similar mass eruption rates.\n[25] A classic problem in analyzing eruptions on Io is the\nuncertainty as to just how the decompression of the gas\ncomponent occurs over the last few hundreds of meters of\nrise of the volcanic fluid to the surface [Kieffer, 1982].\nLinked to this is the issue of whether the stream of gas and\nentrained pyroclasts is pressure balanced, which would\nrequire a sufficiently rapid outward flaring of the vent, or\nis choked, i.e., limited to the local sound speed when the\nvent is not sufficiently flared. In the latter case a series of\nshock waves would be generated immediately above the\nvent in order to decompress the flow [Kieffer, 1984; Kieffer\nand Sturtevant, 1984]. In our model, we follow the variation\nof conditions as gas and pyroclasts expand into a hemi-\nsphere centered on a point-source vent, working from the\nouter edge of the system inward. We are therefore able to\nspecify a linked series of values of increasing pressure,\ndecreasing mean pyroclast speed, increasing local sound\nspeed and decreasing radial distance as the vent is\napproached, but we have no a priori way of deciding which\npressure corresponds to the surface vent.\n[26] Figures 5 and 6 show the variation of eruption speed\nin the vent with the assumed pressure in the vent and the\nassumed mean pyroclast size for Pillan and Pele, respec-\ntively. In each case the upper axis shows the depth which\nwould correspond to the pressure on the lower axis if this\nwere the lithostatic pressure, and curves are given for a\nrange of possible mean pyroclast sizes. The plotted values\ncorrespond to an SO2 mass fraction of 5% in the case of\nPillan and 30% in the case of Pele, these being representa-\ntive values implied by Figure 2. If we now assume that the\npressure at a given radial distance from the vent is in fact\nthe pressure in the vent, then that radial distance becomes\nthe estimate of the vent radius. Figure 7 shows the resulting\nvariation of vent radius with pressure. The results for both\neruption sites are conveniently plotted on the same graph\nFigure 3.

Values are given for two possible distances (150\nand 250 km) from the vent at which SO2 is first deposited as\na solid on the surface and for mean pyroclast sizes of 1, 10,\n30, 100, 300, and 1000 mm in each case. The curves for 1\nand 1000 mm are indicated. The shaded region indicates the\nrange of SO2 mass fractions predicted from the range of\neruption temperatures in Figure 2.\nFigure 4.

The\ncurves for 1 and 1000 mm are indicated. The shaded region\nindicates the range of SO2 mass fractions predicted from the\nrange of eruption temperatures in Figure 2.\n19 - 6 CATALDO ET AL.: VOLCANIC PLUME ERUPTION RATES ON IO\nbecause there is only a very weak dependence of the vent\nradius on assumed mean pyroclast size.\n[27] Finally, Figures 8 and 9 show the variation of Mach\nnumber with assumed vent pressure for Pillan and Pele,\nrespectively. In these cases there is a significant dependence\non mean pyroclast size, as shown. Note that, for the range of\npressures considered, all of the Mach numbers are greater\nthan unity, i.e., the flows are supersonic. This implies that\nwe must interpret the vent radius values in Figure 7 rather\ncarefully: the values correspond to the half widths of the\nerupting volcanic jets after they have passed through a\nsubsonic to supersonic transition, whether this has happened\nbeneath the surface, if the vent is sufficiently flared, or at the\nsurface, if the eruption is choked.\n3.2. The Extent of the Optically Thick Portions\nof the Plumes\n[28] Figure 10 shows the radial extents of the optically\nthick zones of the Pillan and Pele plumes, respectively, as a\nFigure 5.

In each case a representa-\ntive gas mass proportion in the erupting mixture is used\nbased on Figure 2, up to 6% for Pillan and 29\u201334% for\nPele. The extents of the optically thick regions are seen to\nincrease with increasing distance from the vent at which\ncondensation is taken to occur and to decrease at large mean\nclast sizes. The latter effect is to be expected because, at any\ngiven mass flux, an increase in mean particle size implies a\nreduction in particle number density. We note that the\nlargest estimates of the radii of the optically thick regions,\n\u00035 and 12 km for Pillan and Pele, respectively, correspond\nto structures with widths just less than one pixel and slightly\nmore than 3 pixels at the resolutions of Figures 1a and 1b,\nrespectively.\n[29] Gas velocities at the edge of the optically thick\nregion range between a minimum of 629 m s\u00021 at Pillan\n(for 5 mass % SO2 and a mean pyroclast diameter of 1 mm)\nand a maximum of 1583 m s\u00021 at Pele (for 40 mass % SO2\nand a mean pyroclast diameter of 1 mm). These velocity\nvalues do not depend on the distance at which the onset of\nSO2 deposition is taken to occur on the ground. We find that\nthe decoupling between gas and magma droplets\/pyroclasts\nalways occurs well inside the boundary of the optically\nthick region.\n[30] The radial distance from the vent at which decoupling\noccurs depends on the value chosen for the vent pressure (cf.\nFigure 7). At Pillan, if the vent pressure is taken as 20 kPa,\ndecoupling occurs at 44 m from the vent for a mean\npyroclast diameter of 1 mm and the pressure at decoupling\nis 3 kPa; in contrast, if the vent pressure is taken as 2 kPa,\ndecoupling occurs at 2500 m from the vent for 1 mm\ndiameter pyroclasts at a pressure of 30 Pa. At Pele an\nassumed vent pressure of 2 MPa leads to a decoupling\ndistance of 72 m and decoupling pressure of 2 \u0001 105 Pa\nfor 1 mm diameter clasts, and a vent pressure of 2 kPa leads\nto a decoupling distance of 3900 m and decoupling pressure\nof 25 Pa for 1 mm diameter clasts. Decoupling distances are\nnot a function of the gas mass proportion within the erupting\nmixture but vary in direct proportion to the distance at which\nSO2 condensation occurs on the ground. Thus the decou-\npling distance is subject to a much larger uncertainty than\nthe radial extension of the optically thick region. The\npressure at the point of decoupling varies inversely with\nthe gas mass proportion within the magma but is not a\nfunction of the distance at which SO2 deposition on the\nground begins.\n3.3. The Optically Thin Portions of the Plumes\n[31] The fact that pyroclasts and gas are always found to\nenter the Knudsen regime and become decoupled before the\noptically thin parts of the plumes are reached simplifies the\ndescription of this region. Outside the optically thick region,\nclasts will cool to ambient temperature very rapidly: the\ntime t needed for a thermal wave to travel from the edge to\nthe center of a spherical pyroclast of diameter f is given by\n[Carslaw and Jaeger, 1947; Thomas and Sparks, 1992]\nt \u00bc f2= 8 k\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere k is the thermal diffusivity of rock (\u000310\u00026 m2 s\u00021).\nThe time taken for a 1 mm diameter particle to relax\nthermally to equilibrium with its surroundings is thus less\nthan 1 s, and even less time is needed for the smaller\nparticles which we think are produced in these eruptions.\nThe typical \u2018\u2018airborne\u2019\u2019 travel times for pyroclasts erupted at\nPillan and Pele are \u0003750 and 1050 s, respectively, and we\nconclude that the particles stay in approximate thermo-\ndynamic equilibrium with the gas. The maximum ballistic\nrange is \u0003200 km at Pillan, less than the \u0003250 km distance\nFigure 9.

The radius of the optically dense, isothermal\nregion above the vent as a function of mean pyroclast size\nwhen the temperature of the magma prior to interacting with\nnear-surface SO2 liquid is 1900 K. Values are shown, for\nboth Pillan and Pele, for each of the two assumed distances\n(150 and 250 km and 250 and 500 km, respectively) from\nthe vent at which SO2 is first deposited as a solid on the\nsurface.\n19 - 8 CATALDO ET AL.: VOLCANIC PLUME ERUPTION RATES ON IO\nwe have adopted as typical of SO2 deposition onto the\nsurface, whereas the ballistic range is \u0003670 km at Pele,\nsignificantly greater than the 500 km distance adopted for\nSO2 deposition. However, the maximum heights reached by\npyroclasts are 100 km at Pillan and 335 km at Pele. Thus in\nneither case is an SO2 coating likely to form on particles\nthat reach the ground within the radial distance at which\ndirect deposition of SO2 onto the surface takes place.\n3.4. Constraints on Pyroclast Sizes\n[32] Figure 10 shows that no optically dense region at\nhigh temperature can exist unless the mean pyroclast size is\nless than some critical value. The critical size implied for\nthe Pele plume is in the range 150\u2013300 mm, consistent with\nour expectations based on the submillimeter sizes of lunar\npyroclast, whereas the critical size for eruptions at Pillan is\nmuch larger, well in excess of 1000 mm. We have inves-\ntigated the dependence of this implied maximum pyroclast\nsize on the various parameters of the model and find that if\nwe increase the value that we assume for the magma\ntemperature, so that a given eruption temperature corre-\nsponds to a larger proportion of added nonjuvenile volatiles,\nthis reduces the pyroclast size corresponding to a given\nopaque radius. Figure 11 shows the equivalent of Figure 10\nfor a magma temperature of 2100 K: the range of maximum\nclast sizes predicted for Pele is only slightly reduced into the\ndiameter range 100\u2013200 mm, but the diameter range for\nPillan is now much more plausible at 320\u2013550 mm.\n[33] The results in Figures 10 and 11 provide a possible\nmechanism of constraining the mean pyroclast sizes and\neruption conditions even more closely. The target eruption\ntemperatures used earlier in our calculations were derived\nfrom the work of McEwen et al. [1998b] and Davies et al.\n[1999] who fitted two- and three-component model heat\nsources to Galileo thermal measurements. In addition to the\ntemperatures of the source components, their models pro-\nvided estimates of the area of the source component radiat-\ning at a given temperature. For the hottest component,\nwhich we have identified with the optically dense fire\nfountain, they found areas of 0.03 km2 at Pillan and 0.575\nkm2 at Pele. We have used our model values for vent radii\n(see Figure 7) to derive equivalent vent areas when viewed\nfrom above. These, like the radii, are functions of the\nassumed pressure in the vent, the mean particle size, and\nthe distance from the vent at which SO2 deposition on the\nground begins.\n[34] Figures 12 and 13 show the results, for Pillan and\nPele respectively, for a magma temperature of 1900 K. The\npredicted surface area of the vent changes only slightly with\nmean pyroclast size but dramatically with assumed vent\npressure. Thus we can only improve slightly on our max-\nimum pyroclast size estimates, but we can constrain the\npressure in the vent quite well. The implications are that at\nPillan the vent pressure is within a factor of \u00033 of 20 kPa\nand at Pele is within a factor of \u00033 of 2 kPa. These\npressures correspond to the lithostatic pressure on Io at\ndepths of \u00030.5 and 5 m, respectively, and support the idea\nthat these eruptions were nearly pressure balanced rather\nthan being choked. The best estimate of the mean pyroclast\nsize for our preferred SO2 deposition distance of 150 km at\nPillan is \u000310 mm, but increasing the deposition distance to\n250 km would increase the size to 200\u2013300 mm. For Pele,\nour preferred deposition distance of 250 km also implies a\nmean pyroclast size of \u000310 mm. Increasing the deposition\ndistance to 500 km for Pele would increase the size to very\nmuch more than 1000 mm, clearly not in accord with the\nmaximum size deduced earlier. This apparent conflict is due\nFigure 11.

We do not consider\nit likely that the mixture of clasts and gas erupting through\nthe vent itself will have suffered significant cooling, even if\nthe number density of clasts implies that it is not optically\ndense, because the walls of the conduit system will them-\nselves be at the magmatic temperature. However, because\nwe do not take explicit account of the presence of the\nconduit walls in the model, some of the model solutions can\nessentially correspond to situations where all of the optically\ndense region is underground.\n4. Discussion\n[35] There are various issues with which we have not\ndealt in detail. The first is the fate of pyroclasts ejected\nnearly vertically from the vent. After an initial phase in\nwhich both the rising clasts and the surrounding gas\nundergo cooling, the clasts fall back through the optically\ndense part of the plume and their surfaces are reheated.\nThese particles may collide both with other pyroclasts\nand with gas molecules under conditions in which finite\ndrag forces between gas and clasts exist, thus modifying\nthe motions of all components of the system. We have\nneglected the influence of these clasts on both the\ntemperature and the radial flow of the expanding gas\non the grounds that the effects are not likely to be large;\nthey should, however, be included in any more detailed\nmodel.\n[36] Other issues which we have not explored in detail are\nthe gas expansion rates and the gas and particle velocity\ndistributions near the vent. Instead, we have tracked the\npressure and velocity changes inward radially from the\nouter edge of the system until a specified vent temperature\nis reached, and taken the radial distance from the surface at\nwhich this occurs as an index of the vent size. Although this\nprobably gives at least an order of magnitude indication of\nthe vent conditions, it neglects any system of shocks in and\nabove the vent [Kieffer, 1982, 1984] which controls the\nsubsonic to supersonic expansion and the range of angles\nfrom the vertical at which gas and pyroclasts are launched.\nThese initial velocity vectors can exert a significant influ-\nence on the subsequent pattern of clast dispersion [Wilson\nand Head, 1981a; Strom and Schneider, 1982; Glaze and\nBaloga, 2000] and would also need to be incorporated in\nany elaboration of the model described here.\n[37] Finally, we have developed our model on the\nassumption that eruptions take place from central vents\nrather than elongate fissures. The fortuitous observation of\na fissure eruption in the Tvashtar Catena region [McEwen et\nal., 2000] suggests that we need to extend the present work\nto incorporate variable vent geometry; Wilson and Head\n[2001] have made an attempt to address some of the issues\ninvolved in doing this.\n5. Summary\n[38] We have described a relatively simple model of\neruption plumes on Io which provides estimates of the most\nimportant eruption parameters at both the Pillan and Pele\nvolcanic centers. The main results are:\n1. For the Pillan plume, the erupted magma mass flux\nprobably lies within a factor of 2 of 5 \u0001 107 kg s\u00021. For\nthe Pele plume the eruption rate probably lies within\n\u000330% of 5 \u0001 107 kg s\u00021. These values are remarkably\nsimilar. The deduced mass fluxes increase with increasing\ndistance at which SO2 is first deposited on the ground\nwhereas they decrease with increasing gas mass propor-\ntions within the erupted mixture. They are independent of\nthe value of the gas pressure in the vent. The order of\nmagnitude of the deduced mass fluxes is the same as that\ninferred for some massive explosive eruptions on the Moon\n[Wilson and Head, 1981b] and is at the lower end of the\nrange inferred by Wilson and Head [2001] for the recent\nTvashtar Catena fissure eruption on Io.\n2. Our model solutions imply that the erupting magma\ncontains up to \u00036 mass % (at Pillan) and 29\u201334 mass % (at\nPele) of a volatile phase, assumed to be SO2. These value\nare much larger than any plausible volatile contents of\nmagmas leaving the mantle and we assume that they\nrepresent liquid SO2 incorporated into the rising magma\nfrom shallow aquifers. The fact that the values are very\ndifferent suggests significant spatial variability in the\navailability of SO2 in the crust of Io.\n3. The \u00031200\u20131800 K eruption temperatures observed\nby the Galileo spacecraft [McEwen et al., 1998a, 1998b] are\nconsistent with the incorporation into erupting magmas of\nthe amounts of SO2 that we have deduced provided that the\npremixing temperatures are at least 1900 K, reinforcing the\nsuggestion [McEwen et al., 1998b] that Io\u2019s magmas are\ncommonly ultramafic.\n4. We are not able to place very strong constraints on\nthe mean sizes of the erupted silicate pyroclasts. For both\neruption sites the best mean diameter estimate is close to\n10 mm, though values could range up to a few hundred\nFigure 13.

The radial extents from the vent of the optically dense\nportions of the plumes are inferred to be at most \u00032.5 km at\nPillan and 6 km at Pele. The inferred radial extent increases\nwith both increasing gas mass proportions within the erupted\nmixture and increasing distances from the vent at which the\nonset of SO2 condensation occurs on the ground. These\noptically dense region sizes are just below the reliable\nresolution limits of the current best images of these plumes.\n6. The inferred vent radii are \u000390 m at Pillan and 500 m\nat Pele. Inferred vent size is directly proportional to the radial\ndistance from the vent at which SO2 begins to deposit on the\nground, and is inversely proportional to the square root of the\npressure in the vent.\n7. Our estimates of the gas pressures in the vents are quite\nwell constrained, being \u000320 kPa at Pillan and 2 kPa at Pele.\nFor all combinations of vent pressure and inferred gas mass\nproportion within the erupting gas\u2013pyroclast mixtures,\neruption velocities are predicted to be supersonic at the\nvent, though they are only just so for the highest gas mass\nfraction estimates in the Pele plume.\nNotation\nA surface area of hemisphere above vent (2pR2), m2\nCm specific heat of magma at constant volume, equal to\n1100, J kg\u00021 K\u00021\nCsl specific heat of liquid SO2 at constant volume, equal\nto 1300, J kg\u00021 K\u00021\nCsv specific heat of SO2 vapor at constant volume, equal\nto 800, J kg\u00021 K\u00021\nD radial distance from vent of SO2 condensation, m\nG correction factor for range of pyroclast sizes, equal to\n1.5\nH height in plume of SO2 condensation, m\nLs latent heat of vaporization of SO2, equal to 4 \u0001 105,\nJ kg\u00021\nM mass flux of erupting material, kg s\u00021\nN Avogadro\u2019s number, equal to 6.02 \u0001 1026, kmol\u00021\nPd gas pressure when pyroclasts and gas decouple, Pa\nPf final pressure of gas\u2013magma mixture, Pa\nPi initial pressure of gas\u2013magma mixture, Pa\nQ universal gas constant, equal to 8.314, kJ K\u00021 kmol\u00021\nR radial distance from vent, m\nRf final radial distance from vent, m\nRi initial radial distance from vent, m\nS mean spacing between pyroclasts, m\nT equilibrium temperature of magma\u2013SO2 mixture, K\nTb temperature at which SO2 evaporates, equal to\n262.4, K\nTd temperature when pyroclasts and gas decouple, K\nTi initial temperature of the gas\u2013magma mixture, K\nTl initial SO2 liquid temperature, equal to 200, K\nTmi initial magma temperature, K\nV0 velocity of pyroclasts decoupling from gas, m s\n\u00021\nd diameter of SO2 molecule, equal to 4 \u0001 10\u000210, m\ng acceleration due to gravity, equal to 1.8, m s\u00022\nhm plume top height above optically thick region, m\nm molecular weight of SO2\nn mass fraction of SO2 entrained into magma\nuf final velocity of gas\u2013magma mixture, m s\n\u00021\nui initial velocity of the gas\u2013magma mixture, m s\n\u00021\n\u0003 opacity depth of particle\u2013gas mixture, m\nb general bulk density of gas\u2013pyroclast mixture, kg\nm\u00023\nbf final bulk density of gas\u2013pyroclast mixture, kg m\n\u00023\nbi initial bulk density of gas\u2013pyroclast mixture, kg m\n\u00023\ng ratio of specific heats for SO2, equal to 1.33\nq limiting angle for pyroclast ejection\nk thermal diffusivity of rock, equal to 7 \u0001 10\u00027, m2 s\u00021\nl mean free path of molecules, m\nf mean diameter of pyroclasts, m\nr density of gas phase, kg m\u00023\ns density of solid magma droplets, equal to 2900, kg\nm\u00023\nsl density of liquid magma droplets, equal to 2600, kg\nm\u00023\nt time for passage of thermal wave, s\n[39] Acknowledgments.
