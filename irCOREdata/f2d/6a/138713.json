Numerous\npublications have linked TP53 mutations in general or at specific locations to\npatient prognosis and therapy response. The findings of many studies using\ngeneral approaches such as immunohistochemistry or sequencing are\ncontradictory. However the detection of specific mutations, especially those\noccurring in the structurally important L2 and L3 zinc binding domains, which\nare the most common sites of TP53 mutations, have been linked to patient\nprognosis and more strongly to radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance in\nseveral major cancers. In this study, the TI-SPR-1 surface plasmon\nresonance system and Texas Instruments SpreetaTM chips were used to\ndevelop a DNA biosensor based on thiolated probes complementary to these\ndomains. The sensors were able to detect these mutations in both\noligonucleotides and PCR products with normal and mutant TP53 DNA, but\nthe difference in hybridisation signal was small. Preliminary experiments to\nenhance the signal using Escherichia coli mismatch repair proteins, MutS and\nsingle strand binding protein were carried out. It was found that MutS was\nunable to bind to mismatch oligonucleotides, but single strand binding protein\nwas able to bind to single stranded probes which had not hybridised to the\ntarget, resulting in a 3-fold increase in the sensitivity of the biosensor. While\nfurther work needs to be carried out to optimise the system, these preliminary\nexperiments indicate that the TI-SPR-1 can be used for the detection of\nclinically relevant mutations in the TP53 gene and that the sensitivity can be\nincreased significantly using single strand binding protein. This system has a\nnumber of advantages over current mutation detection technologies, including\nlower cost, ease of sensor preparation and measurement procedures,\ntechnical simplicity and increased speed due to the lack of need for gel\nelectrophoresis.\nKeywords: TP53 mutation, p53 mutation, DNA biosensor, surface plasmon\nresonance, mutation detection, optical biosensor\n1. Introduction\nThe human genome mapping project has facilitated and driven the\ndevelopment of many new technologies for molecular diagnostic applications,\nincluding immunoassays, protein assays, genetic analysis and gene\nexpression studies (Gander et al., 2003). These tools have the potential to be\nused and have in some cases already been used widely in medical\ndiagnostics, particularly in cancer diagnostics. It is highly desirable to be able\nto determine the presence of cancer in asymptomatic patients, how\naggressive the tumour is, whether there are metastases, the preferred\ntreatment, effectiveness of surgery, the response to chemotherapy and\nrecurrence of tumours (Gander et al., 2003). A major area where genetic\ntests could be applied is in prognosis and therapy selection and to that end a\nlarge amount of research has been carried out to link genes and genetic\nmutations to cancer pathogenesis and response to treatment. The human\nTP53 gene is a prime example of this, as extensive research has revealed\nthat this gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers and it is\nthought to be inactivated or function abnormally in the majority of tumours.\nThis can be observed by either increased concentration of p53 protein,\ncomplete absence of p53 protein or the presence of genetic mutations or\nmutated forms of p53 protein. Not only does mutation disable the normal\nTP53 functions, including cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in\nresponse to DNA damage and inhibition of angiogenesis, but some mutations\ncan also provide tumours with growth advantages and resistance to\nchemotherapy and ionising radiation. Although the prevalence of different\nTP53 mutations varies between cancer types and tumour subclasses, the\nmost common mutations occur at \u201chotspot\u201d codons on the gene. These\nmutations can be detected either by analysing the p53 protein structure, the\nlevel of p53 protein expression or all or part of the TP53 genetic sequence.\nThe advantage of full-length sequencing is that no mutations are missed, but\nthis procedure is time consuming. In addition, the quicker sequencing\nmethods and other mutation detection technologies are not always accurate,\nare very technically demanding or have to be repeated using different\nconditions to obtain maximum sensitivity. Short oligonucleotide probes can\nbe used in a number of ways to detect particular mutations with a high\nsensitivity or can be combined with other probe sequences to rapidly detect\nmutations at several sites at once. This technology is ideally suited to the\ndetection of gene mutations which can occur at a number of particular\ncodons, such as TP53 mutations.\nA number of studies have found that mutations in specific structural domains\nof the TP53 gene are linked to patient prognosis and response to specific\ntherapies and where there is sufficient evidence that this is the case a\nclinician could use a diagnostic test to select the most appropriate treatment\nfor individual patients (Soussi & B\u00e9roud, 2001). The biological justification for\nthis, areas where it might be applied and the mutation detection technologies\ncurrently available for this application, have recently been reviewed (Jiang et\nal., 2004a).\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the potential of surface plasmon\nresonance as a means of detecting point mutations in the TP53 gene with a\nview to the development of sensors to detect mutations within the structurally\nimportant and clinically significant regions where TP53 mutations occur. Such\na sensor could have value in both assessing prognosis and therapy selection\nfor cancer patients. We sought to show that the detection of single base\nmutations in the TP53 gene using a surface plasmon resonance DNA\nbiosensor based on the Texas Instruments SpreetaTM system, could be\nenhanced by the application of the mismatch binding protein MutS and single\nstand binding protein.\n2. Materials & Methods\nThe TI-SPR-1 (Texas Instruments, USA) optical biosensor system was used\nwith SpreetaTM sensor chips coated with thiol-immobilised DNA probes\n(Sigma-Genosys, Cambridge, UK) in a flow cell format (see Figure 1) and\ncontrolled by SpreetaTM software. The 28-mer DNA probes corresponded to\nthe structurally important L2 zinc binding domain of the TP53 gene (sequence\n3'--HS-(CH2)6-CTCCAACACTCCGCGACGGGGGTGGTAC--5' and were used\nto detect hybridisation of oligonucleotide probes (Sigma, Milan, Italy) identical\nto both the normal TP53 sequence (5'--\nGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATG--3') and the most common\nmutation in this region, a (G \uf0e0 A SNP at codon 175) (5'--\nGAGGTTGTGAGGCACTGCCCCCACCATG--3'). Sensor chips were\nprepared by cleaning with ethanol followed by 10 minutes incubation in a\nsolution containing ethanol, 30% ammonia, and MilliQ water in a 1:1:5 ratio.\nAfter drying the chips were inserted into the TI-SPR-1 and the flow cell\nconnected. Thiloated probe (1\u03bcM) in potassium phosphate buffer (KH2PO4,\npH 3.4) was then passed over the sensor surface for 2 hours at 5\u03bcl \/ minute,\nfollowed by 1 hour exposure to 6-mercapto-1-hexanol in darkness at the same\nflow rate. The chips were stored in flowing MilliQ water (2\u03bcl\/minute) overnight\nand exposed to hybridisation buffer for at least 30 minutes before use, in\norder to obtain a stable baseline. The high reproducibility of chips produced\nby this method has been demonstrated in previuosly reported work from our\ngroup (Jiang et al., 2004).\nHybridisation was carried out by establishing a stable baseline in hybridisation\nbuffer and then flowing oligonucleotides (1\u03bcM) in hybridisation buffer over the\nsensor surface for 5 minutes. This was followed by 3 minutes in hybridisation\nbuffer to compensate for the bulk effect of the probe solution and to wash\naway any unbound material from the sensor surface. Finally the sensor was\nregenerated by 2 minutes exposure to 25mM NaOH and returned to\nimmersion in hybridisation buffer in preparation for the next measurement. A\nflow rate of 10\u03bcl\/minute was used throughout. The hybridisation signal was\ntaken as the difference between the refractive index at the baseline and that\nat the end of the 3 minute washing step. The mismatch binding protein MutS\nand single strand binding protein (SSB) (Amersham Biosciences, Milan, Italy)\nwere applied after hybridisation to enhance the sensitivity to mutations. The\nproteins were made up in similar solutions to those in other studies; MutS\n(0.22\u03bcM) in MutS binding buffer ((50mM TRIS-HCl, 100mM KCl, 1mM\n(EDTA), 1mM dithiotreitol (DTT), 5mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and SSB (0.29\u03bcM) in\nSSB binding buffer (50mM TRIS-HCl, 100mM KCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM DTT,\n5mM MgCl2, 0.005% TWEEN 20, pH 7.4). Measurements were carried out by\nexposing the sensor to the protein for 15 minutes at a flow rate of 2\u03bcl\/minute\nfollowing hybridisation The sensor was then washed in hybridisation buffer for\n3 minutes at a flow rate of 2\u03bcl\/minute and 9 minutes at 10\u03bcl\/minute, with the\nsignal being recorded at the end of the 9 minute washing step. A negative\ncontrol experiment was carried out by applying SSB prior to the MutS to inhibit\nMutS binding to single stranded DNA and DNA chain ends. In addition,\n0.29\u03bcM bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Amersham Biosciences, Milan, Italy) in\nMutS binding buffer was used as a negative control for all protein experiments\nbecause it is a similar size to MutS, can adsorb strongly to bare gold surfaces\nand exhibits no specific binding to any of the reagents used in this sensor\nsystem. Figure 1 shows a diagram describing how these experiments can be\nconfigured as a detection system.\n3. Results\nOur previous work has shown that the TI-SPR-1 is sensitive enough to detect\ndifferences in hybridisation affinity caused by single nucleotide polymorphisms\n(SNPs) and in particular those relating to TP53 mutations (Jiang et al.,\n2004b). In this study, the mutant DNA sequence containing a single base\nmutation produced a refractive index change (RIC) discernible from that of the\nnormal DNA sequence on any given SpreetaTM chip. However, this\ndifference was relatively small and slight variations between chips may\nnecessitate calibration of each individual chip for reliable routine use.\nIn this study MutS and SSB were applied in an attempt to enhance the\nsensitivity so that clear cut-off points for RICs indicating the presence of a\nTP53 mutation in the L2 zinc binding domain could be established. If applied\nafter hybridisation, MutS should give a higher RIC if a mutation is present than\nif no mutation is present, since mutations create mismatched DNA\nsequences. SSB should also give a higher RIC when a mutation is present,\nbecause mutant DNA has a lower affinity for the immobilised DNA probes and\nless hybridisation occurs, so there are more free probes on the sensor for the\nprotein to bind to. Application of SSB prior to MutS should not affect the\nability of MutS to bind to mismatches, but would prevent non-specific binding\nof MutS to DNA probes and chain ends.\nThe results of these experiments (see Figure 2) show that when MutS was\napplied directly after hybridisation there was no clear difference in binding\nsignal between mutant and normal DNA sequences. Furthermore there was\nno MutS binding following the application of SSB. This indicates that MutS\nwas binding to either DNA chain ends or immobilised DNA probes, possibly\nbecause the high density of immobilised probes on the sensor surface\nprevented the relatively large MutS protein binding to mismatches. However,\nthere was a clear difference in SSB binding between mutant and normal DNA\nand this difference was three times greater than the difference resulting from\nthe hybridisation signal alone.\nThe stability, optimum storage conditions and reproducibility of the sensor\nwere investigated in detail and it was found that it produced a stable baseline\nthrough at least 50 regeneration cycles, high reproducibility of hybridisation\nsignal and could be stored for at least 1 night in flowing MilliQ water\n(2\u03bcl\/minute) with no significant loss in sensitivity (data not shown).\n4. Discussion\nThe inability to detect mismatches using MutS protein in these experiments\nindicates that when MutS was used alone it was binding either to the ends of\nduplexes formed by hybridisation or to single stranded free probe, as was\nobserved in previous studies (Gotoh et al., 1997, Babic et al., 1996). The\nsecond explanation would seem the more likely since the average signal\nobtained with MutS applied to complementary oligonucleotide was higher than\nwhen a mismatched sequence was used. This is supported by the very low\nsignal obtained with BSA, which showed that all the proteins were interacting\nspecifically with the immobilised probes and\/or hybridised oligonucleotides, as\nBSA adsorbs well to bare gold surfaces and indeed has been used as the\nbasis of an immobilisation procedure for SpreetaTM sensors (Kukansis et al.,\n1999). We suggest that the relatively large (91kDa) MutS protein was unable\nto reach hybridised DNA at the sensor surface due to the high density of\nimmobilised probes and so was unable to bind specifically to mismatches in\nthis case. MutY, a protein of the same family as MutS, has been used in a\nsolid phase assay for the detection of TP53 mutations (Lu & Hsu, 1992) and it\nis possible that MutS could also be used in this application if the conditions\nrequired for binding can be optimised.\nThe difference in signal between SSB binding with complementary and\nmutant oligonucleotides was much greater than expected. This can be\nexplained by taking into consideration the fact that the hybridisation conditions\nused were optimised to produce the maximum difference in oligonucleotide\nbinding and this difference would be amplified by the binding of SSB since this\nprotein is larger than the oligonucleotide strands and binds close to the sensor\nsurface. The SSB experimental data reported here is based on preliminary\ntests and further investigation is required to establish the optimum\nhybridisation conditions and SSB exposure parameters and to determine the\nsensitivity with different concentrations of oligonucleotides and PCR products.\nWhile the method is a little more complex and less reproducible than\nmonitoring hybridisation directly, it is still much simpler and quicker than many\nof the mutation detection methods described by Nollau & Wagener (1997) and\nthe remaining difficulties could be resolved easily by the use of an automated\nliquid handling system.\n5. Conclusions\nWhile the prognostic and therapeutic indications of TP53 mutations are still\nsubject to debate, in some cancer types clear patterns are emerging where\npatient response to therapies which cause cancer cell apoptosis through the\nTP53 pathway is considerably reduced when a TP53 gene mutation is\npresent. Current cancer research on the TP53 gene and P53 protein reveal\nsignificant associations between mutations and patient outcomes when\nmutations are present in the structurally important L2 and L3 zinc binding\ndomains in breast, colon, head and neck and lung cancer, wheras other types\nof mutation are not associated with patient outcome at all or are specific to a\ncertain cancer type. The likelihood is that further studies into the significance\nof TP53 mutations in other cancer types will reach similar conclusions.\nTherefore at present a detection system for mutations in these specific\nregions seems the best approach to develop a test with the widest possible\narea of application.\nIn this study a region of the L2 zinc binding domain was chosen as a target\nregion as it was of appropriate length for the analysis and is the site of the\nsecond most common mutation in the TP53 gene, a G-A substitution at codon\n175. The demonstration of a successful mutation detection system using\nprobes corresponding to this mutation leads to the assumption that mutations\nof different types throughout the L2 domain could also be detected, and this\nwill be verified in future work.\nOverall, this study suggests that an optimised system based on the\napplication of SSB after hybridisation could be utilised in the detection of\nthese clinically relevant mutations. Such an approach has the advantage of\nneeding inexpensive equipment that would be relatively straightforward to\nautomate and could provide rapid results, with high sensitivity.\nGold sensor surfaceComplementary DNAFigure 1: Th\nfollowing eac\nbound at the\nconnected to\nlines represe\novals repres\nComplement\nproduce the\nmismatches\nafter hybridisation\nMismatched DNAe Detection Sys\nh of the differe\nsensor surfac\nthe sensors s\nnt target DNA,\nent SSB prote\nary DNA follow\nsame result\nare present.\nafter hybridisation\nComplementary after SSBtem.
