A period (08:10\u201314:40 MLT, 11 February 1997)\nof enhanced electron density in the D- and E-regions is inves-\ntigated using EISCAT, IRIS and other complementary instru-\nments. The precipitation is determined to be due to substorm\nprocesses occurring close to magnetic midnight. Energetic\nelectrons drift eastward after substorm injection and precip-\nitate in the morning sector. The precipitation is triggered by\nsmall pulses in the solar wind pressure, which drive wave\nparticle interactions. The characteristic energy of precipita-\ntion is inferred from drift timing on different L-shells and\napparently verified by EISCAT measurements. The IMF in-\nfluence on the precipitation in the auroral zone is also briefly\ndiscussed. A large change in the precipitation spectrum is\nattributed to increased numbers of ions and much reduced\nelectron fluxes. These are detected by a close passing DMSP\nsatellite. The possibility that these ions are from the low\nlatitude boundary layer (LLBL) is discussed with reference\nto structured narrow band Pc1 waves observed by a search\ncoil magnetometer, co-located with IRIS. The intensity of the\nwaves grows with increased distance equatorward of the cusp\nposition (determined by both satellite and HF radar), contrary\nto expectations if the precipitation is linked to the LLBL. It\nis suggested that the ion precipitation is, instead, due to the\nrecovery phase of a small geomagnetic storm, following on\nfrom very active conditions. The movement of absorption in\nthe later stages of the event is compared with observations of\nthe ionospheric convection velocities. A good agreement is\nfound to exist in this time interval suggesting thatE\u00d7B drift\nhas become the dominant drift mechanism over the gradient-\ncurvature drift separation of the moving absorption patches\nobserved at the beginning of the morning precipitation event.\nCorrespondence to: A.

Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; particle precip-\nitation) Magnetospheric physics (storms and substorms)\n1 Introduction\nThe incoherent scatter radar is probably the most powerful\ntool available for the study of the ionosphere, and during\nperiods of intense precipitation, an estimate of the electron\ndensity is possible at heights starting at around 65 km. The\ngreatest limitation of the method is in the narrow beam of\nthe instrument providing only a single time series of height\nprofiles. Similarly the riometer (relative ionospheric opacity\nmeter) is restricted in that it provides indications of the pre-\ncipitation into the D-region around heights of 90 km but pro-\nvides no direct measurement of the altitude profiles. Chains\nof riometers can provide a good indication of the spatial scale\nand movement of absorption features related to precipitation\n(Rosen and Winkler, 1970). With the inception of the imag-\ning riometer (Detrick and Rosenberg, 1990) observations of\nprecipitation over a wide field-of-view became possible and\ncombining the observations of the riometer with those of the\nincoherent scatter radar expands significantly the scope of the\ntwo instruments (e.g. Collis and Hargreaves, 1997; Collis et\nal., 1997).\nPrecipitation into the high latitude auroral zones is pre-\ndominantly through scattering of energetic particles from\nclosed field lines, which are then lost into the denser atmo-\nsphere. The scattering process is usually due to the growth\nof wave particle interactions, feeding and extracting energy\nfrom the trapped, mirroring particles and altering the pitch\nangle distribution. These ELF\/VLF waves are detected using\nradio receivers, however ground based magnetometers detect\nthe signature of ULF waves which may play a role in mod-\n1322 A. J.

The dynamics of the precipitation pro-\nvide an insight into the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling\nand interactions on the dayside. An increase in solar wind\ndynamic pressure can drive precipitation in the auroral zones\n(Brown et al., 1961) and the location and scale size is de-\npendent on the position of the open-closed field line bound-\nary (Brown, 1978). Nishino et al. (1999) demonstrated that\nchanges in the IMF (interplanetary magnetic field) can also\nlead to increases in high latitude absorption due to the inten-\nsification of field aligned currents close to the location of the\ncusp. Absorption in the morning sector is a common occur-\nrence (e.g. Hargreaves, 1969; Hargreaves and Berry, 1976).\nThis absorption has been linked to precipitation of eastward\ndrifting electrons, injected on the night side during substorm\nactivity; however some discrepancies between the theory and\nthe observations still arise (Hargreaves and Devlin, 1990).\nIn this paper we present an example of enhanced lower\naltitude electron density observed in the morning sector\nand around magnetic local noon in the auroral zone on the\n11 February 1997. This corresponds to slowly varying, but\nhigh, HF radio absorption and changing ionospheric flows.\nThe mechanisms of precipitation are discussed with refer-\nence to particle injection during substorms and the ensuing\ngradient-curvature drifts of the energetic electrons.\n2 Instrumentation\nThroughout the period of interest the mainland UHF\nEuropean Incoherent Scatter radar (EISCAT) at Troms\u00f8\n(69.59\u25e6 N, 19.23\u25e6 E geographic coordinates) was running\nthe field aligned cp1k programme (Rishbeth and Williams,\n1985). The data presented in this paper are from the power\nprofile (scaled to give an estimate of the electron density)\nand start at an altitude of \u223c 65 km in the D-region ending at\n\u223c 180 km altitude (lower F-region). A two-minute integra-\ntion period is used.\nThe Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi (69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E, geographic coordinates) has\nbeen active since September 1994, operating at 38.2 MHz\n(Browne et al., 1995). The antenna consists of a 64-element\ndipole phased array that provides 49 imaging beams over a\n240 by 240 km field-of-view. The horizontal beam widths\nin the D-region are of the order of 20 km near the zenith\nand all the beams are sampled every second. The beams are\nnumbered from the west to east in seven rows from 1 to 49.\nThe field aligned EISCAT beam intersects with beam 16 of\nIRIS at 90 km altitude. The riometer operates by monitoring\nthe cosmic radio noise and comparing the received power to\na quiet day level when contributions from precipitation are\ninsignificant. These quiet day curves (QDC) are generated\nthrough an empirical method, refined at Lancaster Univer-\nsity (S. R. Marple, private communication), to account for\nseasonal variations. Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Observatory op-\nerates a chain of broad beam riometers. Each instrument op-\nerates at frequencies around 30 MHz, however for this study\nthey have all been corrected for 38.2 MHz using the assump-\ntion that the absorption is proportional to the inverse square\nof the frequency (Hargreaves, 1969). Each riometer uses a\ntheoretical quiet day curve that will produce errors relative\nto the method for IRIS QDC generation, however with high,\nslowly varying absorption (such as throughout this event) any\ndifferences due to QDC are insignificant.\nFigure 1 shows the locations for the riometers used in\nthis study, together with the locations of the EISCAT site\nat Troms\u00f8 and the location of the Finland HF radar of\nCUTLASS (Cooperative UK Twin Located Auroral Sound-\ning System), part of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Net-\nwork (SuperDARN) (Greenwald et al., 1995). The radar\nhas 16 beams and was running in standard common mode\nwith 45 km range gates. All beams have a dwell time of 7 s\nwith the scan synchronised to start every 2 min. Not enough\nionospheric scatter was present from the Iceland East site\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: Substorm related changes in precipitation in the dayside auroral zone 1323\nof CUTLASS during this event and so it has been omitted\nfrom the study. Three passes of DMSP spacecraft close to\nEISCAT (\u2264 10\u25e6 longitude away) occurred throughout the\nevent. The DMSP satellites are in sun synchronous orbits\nat \u223c 830 km altitude with \u223c 100 min orbital periods. The\nF10 spacecraft is gradually precessing to later local times at\na rate of \u223c 15 min\/year. The auroral particle sensors (SSJ4)\non the DMSP (Defence Meteorological Satellite Programme)\nspacecraft (F10, F12 and F13) measure precipitating parti-\ncles in the energy range of 30 eV to 31 keV, in 20 channels\neach for ions and electrons (Hardy et al., 1984). The higher\nend of this range overlaps with the lower end of the sensitiv-\nity of IRIS, which detects the influence of high-energy elec-\ntrons (10 s of keV). All magnetic coordinates and L-values\ndiscussed in this paper are in the Altitude Adjusted Corrected\nGeomagnetic coordinate system (Baker and Wing, 1989) us-\ning the IGRF-2000 (International Geomagnetic Reference\nField) model.\n3 Observations\nThe interval preceding 11 February 1997 was particularly\nactive. A large magnetic cloud had passed the Earth on\n10 February and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) had\nbeen highly variable throughout the preceding week with\nhigh solar wind speeds up to \u223c 650 km\/s at the L1 point.\nBy the time of the event presented here (06:00 to 12:30 UT,\n11 February 1997) the wind speed had slowed to around\n450 km\/s and continued to slow throughout the day reaching\na low of 400 km\/s by 11:40 UT. Figure 2 shows the northward\n(Bz) and eastward (By) components of the IMF together\nwith the dynamic ion pressure during the event. The data\ncome from the GEOTAIL satellite (Kokobun et al., 1994;\nMukai et al., 1994), which was moving duskward in the so-\nlar wind at about 10RE . This suggests that the satellite was\nin the magnetosheath, between the bowshock and the magne-\ntopause. The timing from the magnetopause to the foot of the\nionosphere is estimated to be approximately 2 min (Stauning\net al., 1995a). Data from the satellite are available from\n06:00 UT to 12:00 UT.\nFigure 3 shows the time series from three ground-based\ninstruments starting from 06:00 UT (08:10 MLT at EISCAT)\non 11 February 1997. The top panel shows raw electron den-\nsity values between 65 and 180 km measured by the EISCAT\nradar, uncorrected for the electron to ion temperature ratio.\nThis correction is not expected to be important at E-region\nheights and below where Te \u223c Ti .

On inspection of the multi-beam data,\nthe northernmost beam of IRIS observes an increase of 1 dB\nat 06:15 UT, which then expands equatorward, covering the\nwhole field-of-view by 06:50 UT. With the assumed delay\ntime from GEOTAIL the initial increase in absorption corre-\nsponds with a small rise (2.4 nPa) in solar wind ion pressure\nover \u223c 15 min.\nFigure 4 shows particle flux-energy spectrograms from\ntwo DMSP satellites. The top panel displays data from the\nF13 satellite split into electron and ion fluxes. The satellite\ncrossed the magnetic latitude (Mlat) of EISCAT at 06:33 UT,\n10\u25e6 longitude west of the radar beam and indicated by the\nsolid, vertical black line. The dispersed ion signatures from\n06:30 to 06:32 UT indicate that the satellite is on newly\nopened field lines, moving south to closed field lines. By the\ntime of crossing EISCAT (06:33 UT) there are no ion sig-\nnatures; there are, however, relatively high fluxes of low en-\nergy electrons and low to medium fluxes of high-energy elec-\ntrons (> 2.5 keV). The maximum energy deposition height of\na 2.5 keV electron is \u223c 130 km, suggesting good agreement\nwith the EISCAT data at this time.

There appear to be 4 distinct bursts\nof structured density between 06:00 and 08:00 UT (06:30,\n07:00, 07:15 and 07:30 UT) with successively decreasing\nmaxima and narrowing height ranges. The maxima of the\nenhancements last for 10\u201315 min. IRIS records matching\npeaks between 0.6 and 1.3 dB. After 08:00 UT another in-\ncrease occurs (1.3 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123) lasting for \u223c 10 min. This\nprecedes a large, long duration increase in electron density\nat 08:15 UT. At 08:35 UT the density increase reaches to a\nlower altitude of \u223c 77 km before gradually rising to the pre-\nvious altitude limits. This corresponds with high absorption\n(3 dB). Electron densities remain> 1011 m\u22123 until 09:50 UT,\nwith an increasing lower altitude limit. This is reflected in\nthe riometer time series as a gradual decrease in absorption.\nA pass by the F12 satellite at 09:58 UT (5\u25e6 longitude from\nEISCAT) coincided with decay in the electron density (data\nnot shown). Low fluxes of energetic electrons were observed\ntogether with softer electron precipitation that deposits in the\nlower F-region, in good agreement with the EISCAT data.\nThe EISCAT observations can be placed in a spatial context\nby considering the nearby chain of riometers.\nFigure 5 is a stack plot of the riometer data, incorporat-\ning the IRIS wide beam. The top panel is from the Horn-\nsund instrument located at the southern tip of Svalbard.\nThe remaining instruments are on the mainland and are or-\ndered in descending magnetic latitude (see Fig. 1). The Y -\naxis divisions are 0.5 dB. Neither Hornsund (73.8\u25e6 Mlat) nor\nJyva\u00a8skyla\u00a8 (58.8\u25e6 Mlat) witness absorption above 0.5 dB from\n06:00 to 12:30 UT, placing a definite latitudinal limit to the\nprecipitation. The time lag in the event onset can be seen in\nthe riometer chain. Oulu (61.5\u25e6 Mlat) does not see increased\nabsorption until 08:00 UT. At this time the riometers from\nAbisko to Oulu see a rise of at least 2 dB maximising after\n08:40 UT. The absorption reaches background levels at Oulu\nby 10:00 UT.\nA. J.

Two passes from DMSP satellites are shown. The black vertical lines illustrate the times of crossing the magnetic latitude of EISCAT.\nThe top panel is from the F13 spacecraft around 06:30 UT. The bottom panel is a pass by the F10 satellite close to 11:00 UT.\nThroughout the precipitation event, the Finnish search-coil\nmagnetometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi observes intense pulsations par-\nticularly in the < 0.2 Hz range (Fig. 3, bottom panel). From\n06:00\u201310:00 UT there are low intensity pulsations of < 1 Hz,\nwith a maximum below 0.4 Hz. There is some time coin-\ncidence of the bursts of electron density with the pulsations\nlasting for 10 to 15 min and separated by \u223c 10 min intervals.\nThe weakest burst of pulsations coincides with the large in-\ncrease in absorption at 08:40 UT. After 09:45 UT, there are\nmuch more intense, continuous pulsations occurring in the\nfrequency range of 0.2 to 0.6 Hz. This frequency band nar-\nrows over the next 90 min. From 10:00 UT, a change in the\naltitude spread of the electron density occurs (Fig. 3, top\npanel). Enhancements range from \u223c 80 km to 130 km al-\ntitude, with lower density values. The absorption peaks at\nabout 1.4 dB due to the extended height range of electron\ndensity. The final DMSP pass (Fig. 4, bottom panel) is by\nthe F10 satellite at 10:59 UT (7\u25e6 longitude away). Once\nagain there is the dispersed ion signature as the satellite trav-\nels equatorward through the cusp. There is a distinct lack\nof energetic electrons at this time; however, there are fluxes\nof 10 s of keV ions over a short latitude range. This coin-\ncides with the E-region densities observed by EISCAT and\nthe structured Pc1 pulsations recorded by the magnetome-\nter. Although there is evidence of softer electrons, there are\nalso high fluxes of energetic ions (10\u201330 keV) that could ac-\ncount for the E-region densities. Around 11:00 UT, the iono-\nsphere starts to lift so that by 11:12 UT most of the D-region\ndensity has disappeared. Instead there are strong densities\n(> 1.5\u00d71011 m\u22123) in the E-region with \u2018tails\u2019 extending into\nthe lower F-region. These seem to occur in 4 short and nar-\nrowly separated bursts, each lasting 10 to 15 min. The ab-\nsorption over EISCAT is relatively low, with the exception of\na short duration 1 dB spike at 11:30 UT. A sharp cut-off in\nelectron density occurs shortly after 12:10 UT and densities\nthen remain low until late evening. The large spike in the\n1326 A. J.

A stack plot of riometer data comprised of IRIS and the\nSGO chain. The instruments are ordered by descending magnetic\nlatitude.\nabsorption data at 12:15 UT is due to a drifting, narrow arc\nthat is partly covered by beam 16 but does not pass through\nthe much narrower beam of EISCAT. At 11:12 UT, the mag-\nnetometer observes structured pulsations covering the range\nof 0.2 to 0.5 Hz with the upper limit gradually rising to 1 Hz\nand the lower limit increasing to 0.4 Hz over the next 30 min.\nThis structure is repeated at 11:50 UT and coincides with\nnorthward turnings of the IMF. The first of these is clear in\nthe data from GEOTAIL (Fig. 2).\nThe small-scale spatial development of the absorption over\nEISCAT can be ascertained from the keogram in Fig. 6. The\nkeogram is a slice across the field-of-view at constant ge-\nographic longitude (19.2\u25e6). The equatorward expansion at\n06:15 UT is clear and the large increase at 08:40 UT seems\nto occur simultaneously in all beams. The northward drift\nobserved by the riometer chain is visible in the keogram af-\nter 09:40 UT with the most intense absorption being confined\nto the south end of the field-of-view, away from EISCAT. A\npatch of absorption at 11:10 UT drifts poleward and west-\nward with levels exceeding 3 dB. A second patch follows at\n11:30 UT, this one extending further north (66.4\u25e6 Mlat). The\narc of absorption at 12:15 UT meanders poleward as well,\nbut as discussed earlier, it does not enter the EISCAT radar\nbeam.\nFigure 7 displays the line of sight velocities from beam 5\nof the CUTLASS Finland radar that passes over EISCAT.\nNegative values represent velocities away from the radar\nsite and the dashed horizontal line indicates the latitude of\nEISCAT. The lack of data from Iceland East means that ve-\nlocity vectors are not available for 06:00 to 12:30 UT, but\nbeam 5 points approximately meridionally. The scatter is\npatchy for much of the event; however, the velocities after\n11:00 UT are high (sometimes reaching > 800 m\/s) and in-\ncrease in the westernmost beams. The eastern beams show\nlower velocities at this latitude, even turning equatorward\nat the easternmost beam. This indicates that EISCAT is in\na region of strong ionospheric return flow as the field lines\nconvect poleward towards the cusp and across the polar cap.\nVelocities previous to this tend to be low (\u00b1 200 m\/s) as the\ndirection of flow is most likely perpendicular to the radar line\nof sight.\nFinally, simultaneous night side observations are provided\nby the CANOPUS (Canadian Auroral Network for the OPEN\nProgram Unified Study) array of instruments. Figure 8 shows\nthe response of several instruments to the varying geomag-\nnetic activity. The top panel displays the magnetic signature\nat Gillam, filtered for Pi2 pulsations. The central panel shows\nthe latitude integrated (red) and peak (black) intensity ob-\nserved by the Gillam Meridian Scanning Photometer (MSP)\nat 557.7 nm. The bottom panel is a stack of riometers from\nthe Churchill line; Churchill, Gillam and Island Lake from\ntop to bottom. Signal amplitude is illustrated rather than ab-\nsorption. Low activity occurs locally up until 06:10 UT when\na large burst of Pi2 occurs, reaching a maximum at 06:20 UT.\nThis corresponds with increased optical activity and a sharp\nspike in the riometer data indicating energetic precipitation.\nMagnetic midnight occurs at 06:30 UT at the Gillam site.\nActivity remains high from 06:00 UT to 10:00 UT with Pi2\nfluctuations of \u00b1 20 nT and variable optical signatures in the\nMSP related to drifting auroral arcs. A second strong burst\nof activity occurs shortly before 08:00 UT (01:30 MLT) and\nthen again around 09:00 UT (02:30 MLT) and beyond.\n4 Discussion\nHere we discuss different possibilities for explaining the ab-\nsorption observed by IRIS related to the enhanced electron\ndensities. Three main areas are addressed: the effect of the\nsolar wind pressure, drifting electrons from substorm injec-\ntion and time influence of the IMF on changes in precipi-\ntation. From these topics, the precipitation on the morning\nof 11 February 1997 may be characterized as arising from\na combination of two distinct geophysical phenomenon; the\nrecovery phase of a small storm and drifting electrons from\nenhanced nightside activity coupled with solar wind pressure\nchanges. Finally the spatial development of the absorption is\nconsidered and compared with ionospheric flows measured\nby coherent radar. This enables the differentiation of domi-\nnating flow regimes at different times during the event.\n4.1 Solar wind pressure\nThe timing of the first increase in absorption coincides with\nthe first rise in solar wind pressure at around 06:20 UT as-\nsuming a short delay from the magnetosheath to the iono-\nsphere, and the time structure of the absorption broadly fol-\nlows the changing pressure.

Pressure pulses in the solar wind are well\nknown to produce increases in auroral precipitation (Brown\net al., 1961; Brown and Driatsky, 1973) through wave par-\nticle interactions in the magnetosphere, leading to enhanced\nionospheric absorption (Perona, 1972). This sudden com-\nmencement absorption (SCA) is often associated with pole-\nward moving absorption regions (Brown, 1978); however, in\nthis case the absorption spreads equatorward at onset (Fig. 6).\nSCAs are usually associated with pressure increases of at\nleast an order of magnitude greater than the values observed\nduring this event. From this it may be surmised that the solar\nwind pressure is not the sole cause of the elevated electron\ndensity observed at EISCAT. The coincidence in the tempo-\nral structure of the pressure and the absorption suggests that\n1328 A. J.

If high fluxes\nof trapped electrons are present small fluctuations in the mag-\nnetic field will encourage the growth of resonant waves. This\nwill lead to pitch angle diffusion amongst the particle pop-\nulation, resulting in scattering into the loss cone and hence\nprecipitation (Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974). A mechanism\nby which elevated fluxes of electrons are injected onto the\nrelevant field lines still needs to be identified for this event.\n4.2 Substorm drifts\nThe electron density enhancements from 06:15 UT corre-\nspond with bursts of < 0.6 Hz pulsations (Fig. 3). On av-\nerage, these bursts last for 10 to 15 min with a\u223c 10-min sep-\naration suggesting a Pc5 like modulation. Stauning (1998)\nand Kikachi et al. (1988) observed some slowly varying ab-\nsorption events to be related to strong pulsations in the Pc4\u2013\n5 range. Stauning et al. (1995b) and Stauning (1998) de-\nscribe the theory that absorption in the morning sector dis-\nplaying this slowly varying nature was related to the driz-\nzle of eastward drifting electrons from substorm activity on\nthe nightside. Those observations were from the Sondre\nStromfjord IRIS at 73.5\u25e6 Mlat. The CANOPUS observa-\ntions (Fig. 8) confirm that substorm activity was occurring\nin the Canadian sector at this time. Activity at the Gillam\nsite started shortly after 05:00 UT. The magnetometer indi-\ncates low intensity Pi2 signatures at this time, related to a\nsmall brightening in the 557.7 nm emission between 70\u25e6 and\n64\u25e6 latitude. Major activity begins after 06:00 UT with a\nlarge Pi2 signature at 06:20 UT accompanied by a spike in\nthe absorption from the co-located riometer at Gillam. Fig-\nure 9 shows the AE index (top panel) and Dst index for\n11 February 1997. The period of observation at EISCAT is\nhighlighted in red. A sharp increase in the AE index occurs\naround 05:00 UT followed by a much larger increase occur-\nring after 06:00 UT. This reinforces the CANOPUS observa-\ntions of the geomagnetic activity.\nThe timing of the expansion of absorption at onset, across\nthe IRIS field-of-view, gives an estimate of the energy of pre-\ncipitating electrons if it is assumed that electrons are injected\nonto all relevant L-shells simultaneously. The IRIS keogram\n(Fig. 6) illustrates a distinct gradient in the precipitation at\nevent onset. The IGRF-2000 model was used to identify two\nIRIS beams (beams 2 and 46) that have the same magnetic\nlongitude and to calculate their L-values. During the ini-\ntial period of activity a time difference of about 25 min was\nobserved between the appearances of absorption features in\nthese two beams.\nAssuming constant values for the magnetic field the drift\nperiod of a particle can be expressed, following Hargreaves\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: Substorm related changes in precipitation in the dayside auroral zone 1329\n(1995), as:\nP = 733\nE\n\u00b7 1\nR\n\u00b7 G\nF\nhours (1)\nE is the energy of the particle in keV, R is the equatorial dis-\ntance, in earth radii, and G\/F is a function that depends on\nthe mirror point of a particle. Close to the equator G\/F = 1\nand increases to 1.5 for particles mirroring at the poles. It is\nclear that a particle will take longer to complete an orbit on\na lower L-shell than a similar particle at higher L. Particles\nwhich mirror at the equator are ignored for the purpose of\nthis calculation since they are less likely to precipitate than\nthose that mirror at the poles. ThusG\/F is taken to be 1.5 for\nthe following estimation. It should be noted that particles are\ninjected on the nightside and precipitate after dawn, thus they\ncomplete only a fraction of an orbit. For the purpose of this\ncalculation we make the assumption that particle injection\noccurs around magnetic midnight. This follows the observa-\ntions of Vagina et al. (1996) using LANL and GOES geosyn-\nchronous spacecraft to detect dispersed particle populations\nand magnetic field dipolarization. These signatures of the in-\njection region occurred between 21:00 and 01:00 MLT with\nmost before but close to midnight. Thus in this case the in-\njection region is chosen to be around 24:00 MLT. Assuming\nthis injection period, a particle that precipitates at 08:20 MLT\nwill have travelled just over 8 h of magnetic local time. Thus\na particle precipitating at 06:15 UT will have travelled 35%\nof its predicted orbital period and a particle precipitating at\n06:50 UT will have travelled 38%. Hence, the time separa-\ntion of precipitation from a single characteristic energy (E)\non two field lines (R1 and R2) at similar magnetic longitude\ncan be expressed as:\nT2 \u2212 T1 = 1T = 1099.9\nE\n\u00d7\n(\n0.38\nR2\n\u2212 0.35\nR1\n)\n(2)\nWhere 1T defines the time difference of precipitation occur-\nring on field lines R2 and R1. Thus for the two IRIS beams\nat L = 6.65 and L = 5.62, E \u2248 37 keV.\nThis method assumes that electrons are injected, simulta-\nneously, over the range of L = 5.62 to 6.65. EISCAT shows\na maximum of electron density between 85 and 105 km alti-\ntude at 06:20 UT, peaking close to 92 km. The maximum ion-\nisation production of a 37 keV electron occurs at an altitude\nof \u223c 90 km (Rees, 1963). Thus EISCAT appears to verify\nthat the drift timing gives a reasonable estimate of the char-\nacteristic energy of the electrons responsible for the D-region\ndensity enhancements.\nEquation (1) indicates that there is an inverse relationship\nbetween the period of a gradient-curvature drifting particle\nand its energy. Thus, as may be expected, for a given L-shell\na higher energy particle will drift around the Earth at a higher\nvelocity than a particle of lower energy. This leads to an en-\nergy dispersion signature in the particle population that can\nbe observed by satellites (e.g. Vagina et al., 1996). If this\nis the case then it is reasonable to assume that, at event on-\nset, the electron density enhancements observed at EISCAT\nwill be due to a limited spectrum of precipitating electrons.\n00 04 08 12 16 20 00\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\nUT (h)\nDs\nt (n\nT)\n500\n1000\n1500\nAE\n \n \n(nT\n)\nAE and Dst Index - 11 February 1997\nFig. 9.

The\nwhole period was relatively active but a minimum in the Dst index\noccurs around 09:00 to 11:00 UT. AE shows an initial sharp in-\ncrease close to 05:00 UT before a much larger step after 06:00 UT.\nThis can be tested in two ways; the first is by looking at data\nobtained from low orbit satellites (such as DMSP), the sec-\nond method inverts the EISCAT electron density profiles to\nobtain an estimate of the energy spectrum of precipitation.\nHargreaves and Devlin (1990) used the second approach\nto study morning sector precipitation during two intervals.\nIn both cases, the events were much earlier in local time;\nhowever, the principal of energy dispersion still holds. The\nconclusions of that study indicate that the maximum electron\ndensity occurs a short while after onset and that the spectra\ntend to be relatively broad. This is not consistent with the\ntheory of drifting electrons that suggests that the maximum\noccurs at the onset and that the energy spectrum will be nar-\nrow due to the energy dispersion of the particle population.\nThe method used in that previous paper has been applied to\nEISCAT profiles from the current study. A description of the\nprocedure (ZABMOD) can be obtained from the appendix\nof Hargreaves and Devlin (1990) but, in brief, it is an iter-\native process that operates between 65 and 110 km altitude\nwith energies from 5.9 to 380.5 keV; an assumption about the\nbackground electron density at these heights can be ignored,\nespecially for un-illuminated periods.\nFigure 10 shows the results for two electron density pro-\nfiles close to the onset of the event on the 11 February 1997.\nThere is an initial hardening of the spectrum that occurs over\na short time range (\u223c 10 min). Pure Gradient Curvature drift\npredicts that the maximum should occur as a sharp onset. It\nis reasonable to expect that dispersion in the particle ener-\ngies will result in a changing signature at IRIS\/EISCAT as\nthe lower energy electrons arrive at a later time. This appears\nto occur in the gradual rising of the lower edge in the EIS-\nCAT electron density (Fig. 3, top panel) between 07:00 and\n1330 A. J.

Note the hardening of the\nspectrum from 06:24 UT to 06:32 UT.\n08:00 UT and also after 09:00 UT, though continuing sub-\nstorm activity observed by CANOPUS suggests that fresh\npopulations are injected at later times. The increased Pi2\nsignature after 06:15 UT suggests that substorm activity is\noverhead at the Gillam site (local time = 23:45 MLT). The\nactivity continues throughout the early event with the most\nintense Pi2 pulsations displaying similar quasi periodicity to\nthe dayside precipitation suggesting a link to the small fluc-\ntuations in the solar wind pressure.\nThe pass of the DMSP F12 satellite at 06:33 UT shows\nthat there were particles of \u223c 30 keV present on field lines\nclose to EISCAT. The flux at this energy is approximately\n3 \u00d7 105 cm\u22122s\u22121sr\u22121keV\u22121 showing good agreement with\nthe derived spectrum. However the satellite also indicates\nthat there is precipitation of electrons with energies lower\nthan the estimated level. These particles must come from\nanother source to the drifting electrons that produce the\nD-region density enhancements at EISCAT.\nAs stated earlier, precipitation of drifting electrons has\nbeen reported at the Sondre Stromfjord IRIS (e.g. Stauning\net al., 1995b; Stauning, 1998) and also at the Japanese IRIS\nlocated at Ny A\u02dalesund on Svalbard (e.g. Nishino et al., 1999),\nboth at higher magnetic latitudes and closer to the polar cap\nboundary than the present observations. The results pre-\nsented in this paper support the notion that gradient-curvature\ndrift cannot be the only explanation for the structure and oc-\ncurrence of morning sector precipitation.\n4.3 IMF influences and changes in precipitation spectrum\nNishino et al. (1999) observed a rectified response, during a\nmorning absorption event, to north-south excursions of the\nIMF. Their observations were from the IRIS at Ny A\u02dalesund\n(\u223c 76.1\u25e6 Mlat) and they concluded that the rectified response\nwas due to the movement of the convection boundary and\nintensification of field aligned currents. In the case pre-\nsented here, the interplanetary magnetic field configuration\nwas predominantly southward and no such response is ob-\nserved, however a change in precipitation does occur with\nchanging IMF over larger time scales. The point of most in-\ntense precipitation (08:40 UT) occurs as the solar wind pres-\nsure dies away during a decrease in clock angle, due mostly\nto a large positive step in By . This change in By will result\nin a change in the convection pattern in the ionosphere and\nso alter the configuration of the geomagnetic field (Cowley\net al., 1991; Khan and Cowley, 2001). A change in the latitu-\ndinal spread of absorption occurs whilst By is positive. The\nrise in absorption at 08:20 UT, due to the increased lower al-\ntitude electron densities, occurs almost simultaneously from\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi to Oulu, although Oulu peaks later. The previous\nabsorption had shown little effect at Oulu (L = 4.3). Precip-\nitation continues for a longer duration at this time (\u223c 90 min)\nthan for the previous bursts in which the electron density\ndecayed within 25 min on average. The distribution of ab-\nsorption suggests two events occurring simultaneously; the\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: Substorm related changes in precipitation in the dayside auroral zone 1331\nfirst a continuation of the drizzle of precipitation confined to\nhigher latitudes, the second a burst of precipitation extending\nfrom deeper in the magnetosphere and across a larger range\nof L-shells. If the magnetosphere changes in a shorter time\nspan than the drift period of a particle, radial diffusion of the\nparticle could occur. Since the dayside magnetic field lines\nhave been skewed due to the change in IMF, By , a drifting\nparticle will encounter a local change of field. As the parti-\ncle moves onto a lower L-shell it will experience acceleration\ndue to the stronger field and shorter field lines. Thus higher\nenergy fluxes are produced at the lower L-shells. With con-\ntinuing wave particle interaction leading to pitch angle scat-\ntering into the loss cone, precipitation of higher energy elec-\ntrons across a broader range of latitudes will be observed.\nAn alternative to this mechanism is that substorm injection\nis occurring across a larger range of L-shells with higher en-\nergy particles being injected. The CANOPUS data show that\nthere is increased activity shortly before 08:00 UT. The pre-\ncipitation is not as enhanced as the onset at 06:00 UT; how-\never, there is a spike in both the optical intensity and in the\nriometer data, suggesting energetic precipitation. By assum-\ning that maximum activity is occurring around local mid-\nnight and that the hardening of the spectrum at EISCAT is\ndue to drifting electrons, it is possible to estimate the charac-\nteristic energy. Thus if injection occurs at 07:50 UT and the\nelectrons precipitate at 08:40 UT, we would expect a charac-\nteristic energy of \u223c 80 keV. This corresponds to a maximum\nionisation production height of \u223c 86 km which is reasonably\nconsistent with the altitude of peak electron density observed\nby EISCAT. A combination of these higher energy electrons\ncoupled with radial diffusion could result in the deeper pene-\ntration and enlarged latitudinal spread of absorption that oc-\ncurs at 08:40 UT.\nAfter 10:00 UT (12:10 MLT) changing conditions are re-\nflected both in the electron density profile, which shifts to-\nwards a maximum in the E-region, and in the drastic change\nin the geomagnetic pulsation spectrum (Fig. 3). This change\noccurs as the instrument location rotates equatorward of the\ncusp in a region of strong return flow in the ionospheric con-\nvection pattern as indicated by the CUTLASS HF radar at\nHankasalmi (Fig. 7). This direction of flow also appears in\nthe movement of the absorption region seen in both IRIS and\nthe riometer chain where there is a poleward and westward\nflow. The DMSP pass at 10:59 UT (Fig. 4, bottom panel)\nindicates the presence of higher energy ions on field lines\nclose to EISCAT with low energy electrons suggesting that\nthe change in density profile is due to increased ion precipi-\ntation rather than electrons. Regions of both high poleward\nflow and high and variable spectral width in HF radars have\nbeen shown to indicate the location of the ionospheric foot-\nprint of the cusp (Baker et al., 1995). Both CUTLASS and\nDMSP observations place the equatorward edge of the low\naltitude cusp a few degrees north (\u223c 71\u25e6 Mlat) of the EISCAT\nsite. Ion precipitation is common in the cusp and both the\nBoundary Plasma Sheet (BPS) and Low latitude boundary\nlayer (LLBL) have been observed to contain ions with ener-\ngies exceeding 30 keV (the upper limit of the DMSP space-\ncraft) (Lockwood, 1997). It is possible that the ion signa-\ntures observed at EISCAT could be related to precipitation\nfrom the LLBL or BPS and the energies seem reasonable.\nThe magnetometer shows bands of Pc1 pulsations, which\nare taken to be signatures of ion-cyclotron waves and lead\nto scattering of ions into the ionosphere. Narrowband waves\nin the Pc1 range have been detected close to the equatorward\nedge of the cusp near to the low-latitude boundary layer (e.g.\nDyrud et al., 1997) giving credence to the speculation that\nthe ions observed at EISCAT are related to the LLBL. It is\nexpected that the Pc1 pulsations reach a maximum intensity\nwhen the equatorward edge of the cusp is located close to\nthe station; however, in comparing the signature from the\nmagnetometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (65.8\u25e6 Mlat) with observations\nfrom a similar instrument at Sodankyla\u00a8 (63.9\u25e6 Mlat) (data\nnot shown), the lower latitude station observes more intense,\nbut similarly structured, pulsations at this time. The dis-\ntance from EISCAT to the equatorward edge of the cusp casts\ndoubt on this being a reasonable assumption and the like-\nlihood of the precipitation being related to the cusp\/LLBL\nis diminished. The increase in intensification at lower lat-\nitudes coincides with increased absorption at those stations\nrelated to increased electron density. Figure 6 shows that the\nsouth end of the IRIS array observes higher absorption than\nthe region around EISCAT. Thus the precipitation of ener-\ngetic ions is maximising deep in the magnetosphere, at low\nL-shells. The changes in the structure of the Pc1 signature oc-\ncur at similar times to two northward excursions of the IMF.\nIon precipitation was occurring before this, during the nar-\nrow band pulsations. The change in IMF may influence a\nchange in the wave structure but appears to have little effect\non the ion precipitation. The Pc1 waves do indicate that there\nhas been a growth in electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC)\nwaves in the magnetosphere close to about L = 4.5 (Mauk\nand Mc Pherron, 1980; Anderson et al., 1992a; Anderson\net al., 1992b). These result in pitch angle scattering of en-\nergetic ring current ions, which then precipitate (Gonzales\net al., 1994). The EMIC wave growth can be attributed to\nthe interaction of cold plasma with hot ions, as the plasmas-\nphere enlarges and mixes with the ring current (Cornwall et\nal., 1970; Cornwall, 1978). The ring current ions have been\naccelerated, either through injection from the tail during the\nongoing substorm activity (Arnoldy and Chan, 1969) or via\nthe transport of plasma sheet particles by enhanced convec-\ntion electric field (Lyons and Schulz, 1989). Since this event\noccurs after a distinctly active period, it is reasonable to ex-\npect the radiation belts to be increased with high fluxes of\nenergetic particles. This theory is reinforced by the Dst in-\ndex (Fig. 9) which shows a minimum of \u221260 nT occurring\nbetween 09:00 and 11:00 UT before increasing as in the re-\ncovery phase of a small to moderate geomagnetic storm.\n4.4 Ionospheric flows\nLow velocities (< 200 m\/s) were observed by CUTLASS\n(Fig. 7) after onset (06:15 UT), most likely due to a predom-\ninantly zonal drift with small meridional movement. These\n1332 A. J. Kavanagh et al.: Substorm related changes in precipitation in the dayside auroral zone\nobservations are contrary to the movement of absorption ob-\nserved by IRIS, which displays a distinct equatorward mo-\ntion after 06:00 UT. From 11:00 UT there is a definite pole-\nward and westward flow of the intense absorption patches to\nthe south end of the riometer field-of-view (Fig. 6). Estimates\nof the poleward velocities have been made for these patches\nboth through comparisons of time series from consecutive\nIRIS beams and through the movement of steep absorption\ngradients in the IRIS images\/keogram. Previous studies have\nshown the drift velocity of absorption patches to be con-\nsistent with the E \u00d7 B drift (Nielsen and Honary, 2000).\nThe current estimates were compared with the flow observed\nby CUTLASS in the region of high return ionospheric flow.\nThe absorption appears to drift with velocities of \u223c 650 m\/s\nfrom 11:00 to 11:20 UT after which there is a general in-\ncrease to \u223c 900 m\/s. The radar backscatter is patchy at this\ntime but several of the radar beams (0 to 11) cut across IRIS\nproviding a good indication of the flows. Only data from\nbeam 5 has been displayed since this is the beam that en-\ncompasses the EISCAT beam; however, data from neigh-\nbouring beams show that there are similar velocity fields\nacross the IRIS field-of-view. The CUTLASS line of sight\nvelocities pre 11:30 UT, at the latitudes of IRIS, are generally\n< 600 m\/s away from the radar. Post 11:30 UT there is a gen-\neral increase with some scatter suggesting flows > 800 m\/s.\nThese rough calculations suggest good agreement between\nthe movement of the F-region irregularities and the absorp-\ntion patches in the E- and D-regions. It is therefore reason-\nable to suggest that the dominant drift mechanism for the pre-\ncipitating particles at this time is the E\u00d7B drift, as opposed\nto gradient-curvature drift apparently observed at event onset\n(06:15 UT). If the absorption at the south end of the array is\nalso due to ion precipitation into the E-region, then the ten-\ndency to drift as the E \u00d7 B velocity seems reasonable. Past\nstudies have established that the flow in the E-region is often\nsimilar to that in the F-region (Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985).\nThe possibility exists that the scatter observed by CUTLASS\ncould come from the E-region irregularities that compose the\nelectron density enhancements (Milan et al., 2001). An in-\nvestigation of the elevation angle of the returned HF beam\nsuggests that this is not the case, with angles of > 21\u25e6 for\nmost of the scatter in the nearer range gates. The E-region\ndensities have well defined \u2018tails\u2019 extending into the F-region\nand so the radar scatter could originate from irregularities in\nthese \u2018tails\u2019.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nA case study is presented of varying precipitation in the\nmorning sector and across noon during an active period\non 11 February 1997. The observations were made using\nan imaging riometer (IRIS) and a nearby incoherent scatter\nradar (EISCAT) together with a chain of wide beam riome-\nters and two pulsation magnetometers, in conjunction with\nsatellite and HF radar measurements. Through nightside ob-\nservation, provided by the CANOPUS array of instruments\n(including a meridian scanning photometer, magnetometers\nand riometers) the precipitating electrons have been linked to\nsubstorm injection and subsequent gradient-curvature drift.\nWith this assumption, the time separation of absorption in-\ncreases across the IRIS field-of-view has been used to pro-\nvide an estimate of the characteristic energy of precipita-\ntion (37 keV). This is due to a lag in the drift time of par-\nticles on lower L-shells. Observations of electron density\nfrom EISCAT suggest that the energy estimate is reasonable.\nHowever it is found that gradient-curvature drift alone can-\nnot account for the spectrum of precipitation at EISCAT. The\ntime evolution of the spectrum indicates that softer precipi-\ntation was occurring before the higher energy particles, in-\ndicative of some other factor affecting the precipitation. A\ncontrolling influence from the solar wind has been identified\nin the form of small-scale pressure changes at the magne-\ntopause, leading to increases in pitch angle scattering in an\nalready unstable energetic population of electrons.\nA small increase in particle penetration into the ionosphere\nhas been discussed in relation to increased radial diffusion\nproducing higher energy electrons at lower L-shells. This as-\nsumption is based on a dramatic change in the geomagnetic\nfield orientation, transmitted from the IMF, and near simul-\ntaneous increase in precipitation. This precipitation leads to\nenhanced absorption in the nearby riometers and is coupled\nwith the more energetic particles being injected at the night-\nside. The electron precipitation then decreases, at the same\ntime as an increase in ion fluxes, the latter being identified in\ndata from the over flight of DMSP F10. The possibility that\nthe ions arise from the LLBL or BPS has been dismissed,\nnot only because of the relatively large distance to the cusp\nbut also because Pc1 waves are observed to increase in inten-\nsity at lower L-shells. Instead it has been suggested that the\nion precipitation is due to a growth in EMIC waves resulting\nin pitch angle scattering of ions into the loss cone. This has\nbeen attributed to an interaction between an enlarged plasma-\nsphere and energetic ring current during the recovery phase\nof a small to moderate geomagnetic storm. At this later time\n(> 13:00 MLT), IRIS was located under a region of strong\npoleward convection. The flows observed by CUTLASS at\nthis time were found to be comparable with the movement of\nstrong absorption patches as derived from the IRIS keogram\nunlike at the start of the precipitation (\u223c 08:30 MLT). This\nsuggests thatE\u00d7B drift is governing the precipitating parti-\ncles at this time rather than L-shell separation of the drifting\nelectrons as at event onset (06:15 UT to 06:50 UT).\nThis study illustrates how a selection of different instru-\nments can be used to describe better the processes involved\nin a single, local event and how they can differentiate be-\ntween overlapping features, both in space and time. The\ncombination of ground-based instruments located in the day\nand night sectors shows how localized events can be placed\nin a global context. The precipitation events observed on\n11 February 1997 have been inferred to arise from two dis-\ntinct causes; recovery phase of a small storm and drifting\nelectrons from enhanced nightside activity coupled with so-\nlar wind activity. Although drifting electron precipitation has\nA. J. Kavanagh et al.: Substorm related changes in precipitation in the dayside auroral zone 1333\nbeen observed by the imaging riometer at higher magnetic\nlatitudes, it is believed that these are the first reported ob-\nservations made using the IRIS at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi. As far as the\nauthors are aware, it is also the first time that precipitating\nparticle energies have been estimated solely using IRIS.\nAcknowledgements.
