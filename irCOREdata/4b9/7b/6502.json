While much of this attitude may be 'hype' there do seem to be trends which\n.stress joined-up views of the world. From a social perspective this is evident in moves towards\npolitical union in Western Europe and the global influence of multinational corporations.\nTechnology is also contributing to the joined-up view. Multimedia supports new forms of\nexpression, which integrate diverse forms of representation, as eloquently advocated by\nNegroponte (1995). Networked technologies enable and encourage global communication\nand information dissemination, as emphasized by the recent decision in the UK to support\nthe development of a Distributed National Electronic Resource (JISC, 1999).\nWhat are the implications of joined-up thinking for learning technology? The glib answer\nwould be that they are many and significant. This instinctive response is understandable.\nThere are rapid changes in the way in which educational provision is conceived, as\nepitomized by the notion of lifelong learning. In parallel ever more powerful technology is\nbecoming ubiquitous. The combination of these two developments is bound to raise high\nexpectations. However, if learning technology is to realize its potential in a joined-up world\nby making genuinely useful practical innovations we must apply a much deeper analysis of\nthe issues.\nIt is not difficult to identify joined-up aspects of the use of learning technology:\n\u2022 support for lifelong learning by breaking spatial and temporal barriers in the provision\nof learning opportunities;\n\u2022 support for international teaching programmes;\n\u2022 access to multimedia forms of representation matched to contemporary theories of\nlearning and teaching;\n\u2022 encouragement for cross-sector work, for example, the current emphasis on links\nbetween FE and HE.\n2\nAlt-] Volume 8 Number I\nThis is not an exhaustive list, but it indicates the scope for the application of learning\ntechnology in a joined-up world. The papers in this issue echo some of these themes and\nillustrate how we can start to conduct a critical analysis of the use of learning technology\nin a joined-up context.\nThe first two papers highlight the growing awareness and acceptance of learning\ntechnology. The results of the questionnaire survey of staff in Scottish higher education\ninstitutions reported by Haywood, Anderson, Coyle, Day, Haywood and McCleod enable\nthem to assert that 'Very few staff at any level view C&IT as of little or no value to\nteaching in their subject, most seeing it as being of moderate to significant value\n. . .' This finding concurs with the results of the phenomenographic study conducted by\nJones, Asensio and Goodyear which 'point towards a common philosophy held by\npractitioners of networked learning'. However, both studies also highlight the need for\nmore work if the capability of technology to encourage joined-up aspects is to be realized.\nHaywood et al. note the existence of significant barriers to use of learning technology, e.g.\nlack of time and a heavy focus on research compared to teaching. Jones et al. emphasize\nthat, while there are generally positive feelings towards learning technology, academics lack\neffective 'rules of thumb' for its effective use. This raises important issues for the design of\neffective technology-mediated learning environments.\nThe Internet-based course in structural biology described by Sansom and Moss is offered\nto students from thirty countries, illustrating the role that technology can play in joining up\neducational provision in an international context. While developments such as this are\nextremely welcome, the discussion by Pincas of cultural aspects of online discussion\nsounds a warning: 'It may be pessimistic to assume that cultural differences and confusions\nare ineradicable, but at the very least, educators must be aware of, and make attempts to,\nsafeguard against their worst effects.'\nThe use of rich-linked resources is a major feature of the descriptions of the Internet-based\ncourse in structural biology by Sansom and Moss and the software tool for stimulating\npractical chemistry by Povey and Bennett. These developments feature the linked use of\ntechnologies such as visual representation and access to text-based discussion groups. The\npotential influence of multimedia as a catalyst for joined-up approaches is evident in the\nclaim by Pincas that the very nature of literacy will be altered.\nIn a context of lifelong learning and the distributed provision of learning environments the\nrole of assessment will be crucial. The use of technology opens up some fascinating\nopportunities for development. Peat highlights this in her discussion of online self-\nassessment materials. Maclaran and Sangster describe how the use of technology can\nenliven and facilitate the use of more traditional assessment techniques, i.e. multiple-choice\nquestions.\nLearning technology clearly resonates with the notion of joined-up thinking. However, our\nunderstanding of exactly what forms this resonance can take, and how we should\nencourage it, is limited. The papers in this issue illustrate how a combination of research\nand examples of successful use can help us overcome these limitations in our thinking.\nDavid Squires\n3\nEditorial\nReferences\nNegroponte, N.
