INTRODUCTION\nThe problem of a particle interacting with a time-\nmodulated barrier has received close attention in recent\nyears. In the quantum case, a question of particular interest\nrelates to the time involved in the tunneling process. Al-\nthough this subject is quite well understood [1], some con-\ntroversial results were pointed out in [2]. Since then, differ-\nent approaches have been used and much attention has been\nconcentrated on both the quantum [3\u20137] and classical ver-\nsions of the problem [8,9]. In the quantum case, several im-\nportant results were obtained, including the frequency depen-\ndence of the tunneling time [2], the transmission probability\nspectrum in a driven triple diode in the presence of a periodic\nexternal field [3], photon-assisted tunneling through a\nGaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs quantum dot induced by an external mi-\ncrowave field [4], sequential tunneling in a super-lattice in-\nduced by an intense electric field [5], electron transmission\nresonance above a quantum well due to dissipation [6] and\nthe probability of dissipative tunneling in Josephson junction\ncircuits [7]. The corresponding classical problem was studied\nby Mateos and Jos\u00e9 [8], and Mateos [9]. In these latter pa-\npers they showed that the dynamics of a particle inside an\ninfinite potential box that contains a periodically oscillating\nbarrier presents a rich hierarchy of behaviors. With an appro-\npriate adjustment of control parameters and initial condi-\ntions, periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motion may all be\nobserved. The authors studied the dynamics using an area-\npreserving map in energy\u2013time variables. The most signifi-\ncant finding presented in those papers was that the traversal\ntime, i.e., the length of time taken by the particle to traverse\nthe oscillating barrier, obeys a power law distribution of ex-\nponent \u22123. This distribution provides clear evidence of cha-\notic behavior, and the authors suggest that the exponent may\nbe indicative of scale invariance. It is also interesting to\nstudy the problem of a classical particle interacting with a\nstatic or time-dependent multi-well potential in the presence\nof noise. Recent investigations include population changes in\nthe presence of an external field [10], the escape flux from a\nmulti-well metastable potential preceding the formation of\nquasi-equilibrium [11], activation over a randomly fluctuat-\ning barrier [12,13], and diffusion across a randomly fluctu-\nating barrier [14]. The notion of the time dependent potential\nmay be also extended to encompass the class of problems\nknown as billiards [15\u201318].\nIn this paper we revisit the problem of a classical particle\ninteracting with an infinitely deep potential well containing a\ntime-dependent potential barrier, seeking to understand some\nchaotic properties of this system. First, we consider the case\nof a periodically varying barrier and then, second, we con-\nsider one that is stochastically perturbed. For the periodic\ncase, we derive a two-dimensional map that describes the\ndynamics of the particle. As we will see, the phase space is\nextremely complex and shows a set of invariant spanning\ncurves in the high energy regime, and KAM islands sur-\nrounded by a chaotic sea at low energies. For intermediate\nvalues of energy it is possible to observe some chaotic re-\ngions limited by two different invariant spanning curves. We\nconcentrate on the low energy region located below the first\ninvariant spanning curve, and we evaluate the Lyapunov ex-\nponents for the chaotic region using a large range of control\nparameters. Using roughening concepts, we obtain a scaling\nfunction as well as the critical exponents for chaotic time\nseries located in the chaotic sea. The scaling function is sup-\nported by a very good collapse of the roughness data for\ndifferent control parameters onto a single curve. We also\nstudy the distribution of successive reflections in terms of\nboth reflection number and reflection time for a particle\ntrapped in a well created by the oscillating potential. For a\nstochastic perturbation, we will show that the particle may\nhave unlimited energy growth once the stochastic perturba-\ntion destroy the invariant spanning curves and KAM islands.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe\nhow the map is constructed. We discuss how to obtain suc-\ncessive reflections and how to evaluate their corresponding\ntimes for a particle trapped in the well created by the oscil-\nlating barrier. We also discuss briefly the method used to\nobtain the Lyapunov exponents. The numerical results and\nscaling properties for the periodic case are discussed in Sec.\nIII. The stochastic version for the problem is developed in\nSec. IV. In Sec. V we summarize the main results and present\nconcluding remarks.\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 016214 (2004)\n1539-3755\/2004\/70(1)\/016214(11)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 016214-1\nII. NUMERICAL TECHNIQUES: THE MODEL AND\nLYAPUNOV EXPONENT CALCULATIONS\nA. The model with periodic oscillations\nWe consider a particle inside an infinite potential box that\ncontains an oscillating barrier. It consists basically of a one-\ndimensional system that may be described by a time-\ndependent Hamiltonian. Let us define the Hamiltonian for\nthis system as Hsx , p , td= p2 \/2m+Vsx , td, where Vsx , td is\ngiven by Vsx , td=V0sxd+V1sx , td. The potential V0sxd is de-\nfined as\nV0sxd = 50, if 0 , x , l and l + b , x , l + b + L;V0, if l \u0142 x \u0142 l + b;\n\u2018 , if x \u0142 0 and x \u00f8 l + b + L;\nand V1sx , td is written as\nV1sx,td = H 0, if x , l and x . l + b;V1 sinstd, if l \u0142 x \u0142 l + b;\nwhere V0 is constant and gives us the height of the static\npotential barrier. V1 is the amplitude of oscillation in the\nregion l\u0142x\u0142 l+b. We analyze the case V1,V0. The param-\neters l, b and L are, respectively, the widths of well I, of the\nbarrier and of well II as shown in Fig. 1. The dynamics of a\nparticle interacting with an oscillating potential barrier may\nbe described by a two-dimensional map T that gives the total\nenergy of the particle and the time at which the particle col-\nlides with an infinite potential wall located at x=0, i.e.,\nsEn+1 , tn+1d=TsEn , tnd. To derive the map T, we will follow a\nsimilar procedure to that used in Ref. [9]. Suppose that the\nparticle start from x=0 at time tn with initial energy En\n=Kn=mvn\n2 \/2.V0\u2212V1. If En,V0\u2212V1, the particle will never\nescape from well I. Starting from x=0, the length of time it\ntakes to reach the left-hand side of the barrier at x= l is tn8\n= l \/vn, where vn=\u02db2Kn \/m. In this situation, two different\nkinds of behavior may occur, depending on the energy of the\nparticle. If En.V0+V1 sinstn+ tn8d, then the particle is trans-\nmitted past the potential and we will use an application that\nwe call TB; otherwise, it is reflected with the same initial\nenergy to the left side of the barrier and we use TA. Let us\nfirst derive TA. When the particle is reflected to the left side\nwith the same initial energy and has a kick from the wall\nlocated at x=0, the new energy is En+1=En and the new time\nis tn+1= tn+2l \/vn. After that, the particle starts again from x\n=0 and travels to the right with the same velocity until it\narrives at the left side of the potential barrier sx= ld. If\nEn+1,V0+V1 sinstn+1+ tn+18 d, the particle will be reflected\nagain to the left side, and so on, until it is able to traverse the\nbarrier. In this case, the application TA at the sn+1dth kick\ncan be written as\nTA:HEn+1 = En,\ntn+1 = tn + 2l\/\u02db2En+1\/m .\nNext, we derive TB. If the particle has total energy En.V0\n+V1sinstn+ tn8d when it arrive at x= l, then it will be transmit-\nted. The particle experiences an abrupt change in its kinetic\nenergy, and the new expression is Kn8=En\u2212 fV0+V1 sinstn\n+ tn8dg. After traveling a distance b at the constant velocity\nvn8=\u02db2Kn8 \/m the particle arrives at x= l+b after a time tn9\n=b \/vn8. Again, the particle changes its kinetic energy\nabruptly to a new value En9=Kn9=Kn8+V0+V1 sinstn+ tn8+ tn9d.\nIt then travels within well II at a constant velocity vn9\n=\u02db2Kn9 \/m. After a time tn-=L \/vn9 the particle will be reflected\nwith the same kinetic energy towards the left-hand side of\nthe potential after suffering an elastic collision with the wall\nof the potential located at x= l+b+L. When the particle ar-\nrives at the right-hand side of the barrier sx= l+bd, two pos-\nsibilities arise: (a) it will be transmitted if En9.V0\n+V1 sinstn+ tn8+ tn9+2tn-d; or otherwise, (b) the particle will be\nreflected with the same velocity back towards the right hand\nside of the well II until it satisfies the condition En9.V0\n+V1 sinstn+ tn8+ tn9+2itn-d. Here, i is the smallest integer for\nwhich the last equation is true.\nWe emphasize that for i.1, the number of successive\nreflections made by a particle inside well II prior to exit is\nsi\u22121d. We will show that the distributions of successive re-\nflection numbers and times obey power laws with same ex-\nponent. If i=1, the particle has not yet suffered a reflection,\nbut if i=2 the particle, still trapped inside well II, has suf-\nfered 1 reflection. The time associated with the reflections is\nti\ns\n= si\u22121d2tn-. If condition sad is satisfied, then the particle is\ntransmitted across the barrier with kinetic energy Kn-=En9\nFIG. 1.

Here, t gives the pe-\nriod of oscillation of the potential barrier, and the product wt\ngives the distance that a particle travels with velocity w in a\ntime t. So the parameter M gives the number of oscillations\nthat the oscillating barrier has completed after the particle\nstarts from x=0 with kinetic energy K=V0 by the time it\narrives at the left-hand side of the potential barrier located at\nx= l [8,9].

They ensure that the\nmaps are area-preserving, because det JA,B=1.\nIteration of T for the parameters M =4.7, r=0.5, b \/ l=0.2\nand L \/ l=1 yields the phase space shown in Fig. 2. To facili-\ntate a comparison with previous results in the literature, Fig.\n2 was obtained with the same control parameters used in Ref.\n[9]. In the low energy regime we can see KAM islands sur-\nrounded by a chaotic sea. The chaotic sea is limited by the\nfirst invariant spanning curve. For intermediate values of en-\nergy, we see a small chaotic region that is limited by two\ndifferent invariant spanning curves. As the map is area-\npreserving, a chaotic orbit enclosed by two different span-\nning curves will never exit them and, similarly, a chaotic\norbit located below the first invariant spanning curve will\nnever rise above the curve nor visit the interior of a KAM\nisland. For high values of energy, we mostly see invariant\nspanning curves. We focus our attention on the low energy\nregime.\nThe successive reflection number consists basically of the\nnumber of the iteration for which the particle is still trapped\nin well II. It is obtained using the following condition:\nFIG. 2. Iteration of different initial conditions for the parameters\nM =4.7, r=0.5, b \/ l=0.2, and L \/ l=1. In the low energy regime it is\neasy to see KAM islands surrounded by a chaotic sea that is limited\nby one spanning curve. For intermediate energies it is possible to\nobserve a small chaotic region that is enclosed by two different\nspanning curves. The high energy domain shows many different\nspanning curves.\nCHAOTIC PROPERTIES OF A TIME-MODULATED BARRIER PHYSICAL REVIEW E 70, 016214 (2004)\n016214-3\nen9 . 1 + r sinSDfb + i4pM\u02dben9 Ll D , s1d\nwhere i is the smallest integer for which Eq.

The distribution of the aver-\nage successive times is shown in Fig. 3(b). The power law fit\nsuggests to us that Pt~ tgt with gt=\u22123.00s2d. The control\nparameters used in Fig. 3 were M =4.7, r=0.5, b \/ l=L \/ l=1.\nNote that both distributions are fitted well by power laws\nwith the same exponent of \u22123.\nB. Lyapunov exponents\nOne tool used to characterize sensitivity to initial condi-\ntions is the well known Lyapunov exponent. In effect, it cor-\nresponds to evolving the system over a long time from two\nslightly different initial conditions. If the two trajectories di-\nverge exponentially in time, the behavior of the system is\nconsidered to be chaotic, the orbit is called chaotic, and the\nLyapunov exponent is positive. If the Lyapunov exponent is\nnegative, the orbit may be either periodic or quasi-periodic.\nLet us now describe briefly the procedure used to obtain\nLyapunov exponents numerically. They are defined [19,20]\nas\nl j = lim\nn\u2192\u2018\no\nk=1\nn 1\nn\nlnuL j\nku, j = 1,2,\nwhere L j\nk are the eigenvalues of M =pk=1\nn Jksek ,fkd and Jk is\nthe Jacobian matrix evaluated on the orbit sek ,fkd. In order\nto evaluate the eigenvalues of M, we use the fact that J can\nbe written as a product of J=QT, where Q is an orthogonal\nmatrix and T is a triangular one. We now define the elements\nof these matrices as\nQ = Scossud \u2212 sinsud\nsinsud cossud D, T = ST11 T120 T22D .\nSince M is defined as M =JnJn\u22121 . . .J2J1, we can introduce the\nidentity operator, rewrite M as M =JnJn\u22121 . . .J2Q1Q1\n\u22121J1, and\ndefine Q1\n\u22121J1=T1. The product J2Q1 defines a new matrix J2\n*\n.\nIn a following step, we may write M as M\n=JnJn\u22121 . . .J3Q2Q2\n\u22121J2\n*T1. The same procedure yields T2\n=Q2\n\u22121J2\n*\n. The problem is thus reduced to the evaluation of the\ndiagonal elements of Ti :T11i ,T22i . Using the Q and T matri-\nces, we find the eigenvalues of M, given by\nT11 =\nj112 + j212\n\u02dbj112 + j212\n, T22 =\nj11j22 \u2212 j12j21\n\u02dbj112 + j212\n.\nWe can then evaluate the Lyapunov exponent using the rela-\ntion\nl j = lim\nn\u2192\u2018\no\nk=1\nn 1\nn\nlnuTj\nku, j = 1,2.\nIt is interesting to observe that l1=\u2212l2, because the map is\narea-preserving. Figure 4 shows the asymptotic convergence\nof the positive Lyapunov exponent for the same parameters\nas in Fig. 2. The ensemble average of 5 different initial con-\nditions gives l\u00af =1.675\u00b10.003, where the error represents the\nstandard deviation of the five samples.\nIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA. Lyapunov exponent evaluation\nIn this section we present and discuss our numerical re-\nsults for the deterministic case. Our first step is to choose\ncontrol parameters, and then we investigate the correspond-\ning dynamical properties. The Lyapunov exponent is evalu-\nated for a large range of control parameters. Figure 5 shows\nthe behavior of the Lyapunov exponent for a large range of\nM. We note that, for three different values of r (r=0.25, r\n=0.5 and r=0.75) and for two different combinations of b \/ l\nand L \/ l (the symmetrical case b \/ l=L \/ l=1, and an asym-\nmetrical one b \/ l=0.5 and L \/ l=1) the Lyapunov exponent\ngrows slowly and monotonically for 4 decades in the M pa-\nrameter. Each point in Fig. 5 was obtained by the averaging\nFIG. 3. Distributions of successive reflection (a) numbers and\n(b) times. The parameters used here are M =4.7, b \/ l=L \/ l=1 and\nr=0.5.

This iteration number guarantees good conver-\ngence of the Lyapunov exponent, as shown in Fig. 4. The\nerror bars indicates the standard deviation of the 5 samples.\nIt is interesting to observe that there are no abrupt transitions\nin l as a function of M within the huge parameter range\nstudied.\nNext we investigate how the Lyapunov exponent varies as\na function of r. We choose the symmetrical case with fixed\nM =4.7. The behavior of l as a function of r is found to be as\nshown in Fig. 6. We observe one very pronounced and abrupt\ntransition, and 4 other smaller transitions. These transitions\nare associated with the destruction of the first invariant span-\nning curve and the consequent merging of different larger\nchaotic regions. Each region has its own characteristic\nLyapunov exponent. In a recent paper [21] the authors ob-\nserved a similar transition in the context of a particle con-\nfined within an infinite potential box containing an oscillat-\ning square well [22]. They proposed that, after the transition,\nthe Lyapunov exponent is given by an average of the previ-\nous exponents scaled by the relative sizes of the correspond-\ning regions of the phase space. We emphasize that this con-\njecture works well here too. To illustrate this, let us use the\nmost pronounced peak, which occurs near r=0.0075. Before\nthe transition, it is easy to observe different chaotic regions\nthat are separated by an invariant spanning curve, as is\nshown in Fig. 7(a). The Lyapunov exponents for regions be-\nlow and above the first invariant spanning curve are lb\n=4.44\u00b10.06 and la=0.811\u00b10.001, respectively. These\nLyapunov exponent values were obtained from a long run of\n23109 iterations using 10 different initial conditions. A na-\nive estimation of fraction occupied is fb=0.33 below, and\nfa=0.67 above. After the transition, just one initial condition\nis sufficient to fill the chaotic region, now representing a\nmerging of regions I and II, as can be seen in Fig. 7(b).\nUsing the relation proposed in [21], we can estimate the\nLyapunov exponent after the transition from the values of the\nLyapunov exponent in the two different chaotic regions prior\nto the transition as\nl\u00af = fala + fblb = 2.008,\nthat is in a good accord with Fig. 6. It is interesting to note\nthat, after the transition, the Lyapunov exponent convergence\nis slower and the error bars are larger. The other transitions\nshown in Fig. 6 may be characterized in the same way.\nB. Resonances on the chaotic sea\nLet us now discuss the distribution of successive reflec-\ntion energies. The range of energies that allow the particle to\nstay trapped is eP femin ,emaxg, where emin=1\u2212r and emax\n=1+r.

The distri-\nbution of successive energies in well II is shown in Fig. 8.\nThe resonance energies are indicated in the figure.\nC. Scaling properties\nLet us now discuss the main idea of scaling properties for\nchaotic time series in this problem. Figure 9 shows the evo-\nlution of one chaotic time series for the parameters b \/ l\n=L \/ l=1, r=0.5, and M =4.7. The amplifications in Fig. 9\nallow us to suppose that some scaling property can be de-\nrived from this time series, once that it has basically the\nsame behavior for very different time scales. We choose to\ncharacterize the behavior in terms of the variance of the av-\nerage energy, which we will refer to as the roughness, v\n[23]. The scaling does not work well for the dependence on\nr because, as r varies, it is easy to identify where merging\ntakes place between the different large chaotic regions (see\nFigs. 6 and 7). Our results clearly work well for the depen-\ndence on M, however, since merging events between the\nlarge chaotic regions are not observed. We choose to study\nthe same range of M as in Fig. 5, just excluding the first\ndecade. We consider the case of a symmetrical system and\nset r=0.1, but similar behavior can, in fact, be observed for\nother values of r.\nGiven the time series, it is easy to evaluate both average\nand average squared energies, defined, respectively, as\nTABLE I.

Figure 10 shows one roughness evolution. It was\nconstructed using an ensemble of 10 000 different initial\nphases and the same initial energy e=1+r, all of them giving\nrise to chaotic evolution. We can see in Fig. 10 two different\nkinds of behavior as a function of the iteration number. Fol-\nlowing a brief initial transient, the roughness grows accord-\ning to a power law, but it eventually reaches a regime of\nsaturation for a large enough number of iterations. The\nchange in behavior is characterized by a typical crossover\niteration number Nx, as shown in Fig. 10.\nThis saturation of the roughness curves is a consequence\nof the limited time series amplitude. It is well known that the\namplitude depends on the position of the first invariant span-\nning curve since, in the deterministic model, the chaotic sea\nis limited by such a spanning curve. For the range of control\nparameter studied (see Fig. 11), one effect of increasing M is\nto localize the first invariant spanning curve in a higher po-\nsition. As an immediate consequence of this, the variance\nwill saturate at a higher value. Thus, we can start to study the\nroughness scaling, supposing following:\n(i) After the brief initial transient, the roughness grows as\nfunction of iteration number according to\nvsN,Md ~ Nb. s2d\nThis growth can be seen in region I of Fig. 10. b is called the\ngrowth exponent. Equation s2d is valid for N!Nx.\n(ii) As the iteration number increases, the roughness\nreaches saturation, as can be seen in region II of Fig. 10. The\nbehavior of the roughness within the saturation regime fol-\nlows the equation\nvsatsN,Md ~ Ma, s3d\nwhere a is the roughening exponent. Equation s3d is valid\njust for N@Nx.\n(iii) The crossover iteration number Nx that tells us when\nthe roughness growth slows and saturation is approached is\ngiven by\nNxsMd ~ Mz. s4d\nHere z is called the dynamical exponent.\nLet now us discuss the procedure used to obtain the satu-\nration value. Even for a maximum iteration number of\n1000Nx, our simulation exhibits a final roughness evolution\nshowing that it has still not reached saturation. To solve this\nproblem, we can choose two different options. The first one\nis increase the iteration number yet more, and start all simu-\nlations again. This choice obviously carries the disadvantage\nof very much longer simulations. The second, and more de-\nFIG. 8.

It consists basically in applying\nthe following transformation to the iteration number N\n\u21921\/N, and it is applicable because the saturation increases\nslowly and linearly for sufficiently large values of N. After\nperforming this transformation, the saturation roughness is\ngiven by\nvsN,Md = vsatsMd +\nb8\nN\n. s5d\nWhen N\u2192\u2018 in Eq. (5), we have that vs\u2018 ,Md\u2192vsat. Tech-\nnically, the saturation roughness can be obtained as the linear\ncoefficient of Eq. (5), given by linear regression. This proce-\ndure is shown in the inset of Fig. 10.\nNext, we obtain the intercept of the power law (in region\nI of Fig. 10) with the saturation value obtained from Eq. (5).\nIn order to obtain the exponents a and z, we plot vsat3M\nand Nx3M, as shown in Fig. 11. These power law fits yield\na=0.670s1d and z=1.331s6d. The mean b=0.500s6d is ob-\ntained from an average of all the roughness curves.\nWe can now proceed to \u201ccollapse\u201d the roughness curves\nonto a universal plot. The first step is to take the ratio\nvsN ,Md \/vsatsMd. This relocates all curves to the same satu-\nration value, as can be seen in Fig. 12(b). The second step is\nto take the ratio N \/Nx. It collapses the curves onto the same\ncharacteristic iteration number, as can be seen in Fig. 12(c).\nThe success of these procedures in producing a single,\nuniversal, roughness plot allows us to describe the roughness\naccording to the following scaling function:\nvsN,Md = zvszaN,zcMd ,\nwhere z is the scaling factor. Choosing z=N\u22121\/a, we obtain\nvsN,Md = N\u22121\/av1sN\u2212c\/aMd .\nThe function v1sN\u2212c\/aMd=vs1,N\u2212c\/aMd and it is supposed to\nbe constant for N!Nx. Using Eq.

From our numerical simulations, we find\nthat b=0.500s6d.\nThe second step is to choose z=M\u22121\/c and it follows that\nvsN,Md = M\u22121\/cv2sM\u2212a\/cNd .\nHere, the function v2sM\u2212a\/cNd=vsM\u2212a\/cN ,1d and it is sup-\nposed to be constant for N@Nx.

STOCHASTIC VERSION\nNext, we discuss the stochastic version of the problem.\nWe suppose that the potential V1sx , td is written as V1sxdfstd,\nwhere fstd gives us random numbers uniformly distributed in\nf\u22121,1g.

It is interesting to observe\nthat n and t are not proportional to each other, since a particle\nof high energy is described with a larger number of iterations\nn than a particle of lower energy in the same interval of time.\nWe evaluate the average energy for an ensemble of particles\nwith the same initial energy e0=1. We find that the total\nenergy grows as e~ndn where dn=0.496\u00b10.001 and e~ tdt\nwith dt=0.649\u00b10.001.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have considered the classical problem of a particle\ninteracting with a time-modulated potential barrier in two\ndifferent circumstances: (i) deterministic and (ii) stochastic.\nIn the deterministic case, where we used an area-preserving\nmap T to study some dynamical properties of this model, we\nfound that the phase space has a complex structure including\nKAM islands surrounded by a chaotic sea that is limited by\nFIG. 12.

Lyapunov exponents were\nused to characterize the chaotic sea below the first invariant\nspanning curve for a large range of control parameters. The\nbehavior of l as a function of M for both the symmetrical\nand asymmetrical cases shows a slow growth in the\nLyapunov exponent; similar behavior does not occur for l as\na function of r. We analyzed the behavior of the roughness as\nfunction of M for a chaotic time series located in the chaotic\nsea. Our results indicates that the roughness obeys a scaling\nfunction with very well defined exponents. After a brief tran-\nsient, the roughness grows with iteration number according\nto a power law of exponent b=0.500s6d. After passing a\ncharacteristic crossover iteration number, however, the\nroughness growth slows and approaches a saturation regime.\nThe crossover iteration number increases with the control\nparameter M according to a power law with a dynamical\nexponent z=1.331s6d. The regime of saturation also depends\non the control parameters and it too increases according to a\npower law as M increases. The roughening exponent is ob-\ntained as a=0.670s1d. The two exponents are closely related\nvia a scaling function. We found that l3r exhibits abrupt\ntransitions as the result of a merging of different chaotic\nregions of varying size. We were able to obtain the Lyapunov\nexponent after the transition by making use of a conjecture\nproposed in [21]. It uses the Lyapunov exponent before the\ntransition in the two different chaotic regions scaled by the\nfraction of the phase space that they occupy. It is especially\ngratifying that this conjecture still gave good results here too.\nDepending on the energy of the particle in the chaotic sea, it\nis possible for it to stay trapped in well II for some interval\nof time. The distribution of successive reflection numbers,\nPm, and the corresponding distribution of the average succes-\nsive reflection times, Pt, are very well fitted by a power law\ntail. Our results indicates that Pm~mgm and Pt~ tgt with ex-\nponents gm=gt,\u22123. These results, like those shown in\n[8,9,21] may be an indication of some kind of universality\nclass.\nFor the stochastic version, our results indicate that, after\nall invariant spanning curves are broken, it is possible to\nobserve unlimited energy growth. The behavior of the aver-\nage energy for an ensemble of different initial conditions\nindicates that e~ndn with dn,0.5 and e~ tdt with dt,2\/3.\nThese exponents are different because a particle of high en-\nergy is described by more iterations than a slow one in the\nsame interval of time.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nE.
