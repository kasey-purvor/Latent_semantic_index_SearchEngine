These\ninclude the following:\n\u2022 The tippe top. This simple toy looks a little like an upside-down mushroom. However,\nwhen it is spun on a flat surface, it will flip over and stand upright. There are many\npapers which consider the dynamics of this toy, including [12, 13].\n\u2022 The rattleback. When spun in a particular direction, the rattleback will gradually slow\ndown and then the spinning motion is replaced by oscillating motion. As the oscillations\nstart to slow down, the rattleback then starts spinning in the opposite direction. The\nmodelling of this behaviour has been considered by a number of authors [3, 8, 11].\n\u2022 Chaos toys. A number of simple mechanical systems have been shown to demonstrate\nchaos such as the one described in [1].\nIn this paper, we consider another very simple toy, namely a superball. The interesting\naspects of a superball are that (i) it is highly elastic with a coefficient of restitution close to\n1, and so bounces very high and (ii) at a bounce, it grips the surface very well which can\nresult in a significant change in spin of the ball. These two aspects result in some interesting\nbehaviour for a bouncing superball.\nThe classical approach to modelling the bounce of a ball is described in texts such as\nRouth [14]. It is assumed that during the impulsive interaction of the ball with the surface\non which it is bouncing, the impulsive friction and normal reaction obey the laws of friction\nand Routh [14] cites experimental evidence to this effect. However, whilst this approach can\ndescribe a single reversal of direction of motion of the ball, it is unable to predict the rich\nspectrum of back and forward motions which the superball can exhibit.\nThe modelling of the bounce of a ball in the vertical direction consists of two components,\nnamely (i) a reversal of the vertical velocity and (ii) a reduction in the vertical velocity after\nthe bounce by a (constant) coefficient of restitution. To model the bounce of a superball,\nthe first of these two concepts was extended by Garwin [9] who considered a similar model\nin the horizontal direction wherein the horizontal motion of the ball at the point of impact\nis reversed at the bounce. Cross [5] modified Garwin\u2019s model by introducing the second\ncomponent of a horizontal coefficient of restitution that reduces the horizontal velocity of the\nball after the bounce by a fixed amount. In both cases, this equation describing the change\nin the horizontal velocity at the bounce was combined with an equation representing the\nconservation of angular momentum. These two equations were solved to give the horizontal\nand angular velocities after the bounce in terms of these quantities before the bounce.\nCross [5] compared the bounce of a superball with the bounce of a tennis ball whereas\nGarwin [9] was particularly interested in the phenomenon where the superball reverses di-\nrection when it is thrown forward to bounce between two horizontal parallel surfaces. This\nbehaviour was also investigated by Hefner [10] but in the case where the parallel surfaces\nare vertical. He also briefly considered the multiple bounces of a superball on a flat surface.\nBridges [2] used strobe photography to try and measure the horizontal coefficient of\nrestitution under different conditions. The results do not show much uniformity, but it is\nacknowledged that they are \u201csubject to a higher degree of error than is desirable\u201d. Experi-\nmental results by Cross [6] show a much more consistent picture for the horizontal coefficient\nand indicate that it is approximately constant at a value around 0.5 over a wide range of\n1\nav\n\u03c9\ng\nu\nP\nx\ny\nFigure 1: The parameter and variables of the ball.\nincident angles, dropping down slightly for small incident angles. Dome\u00b4nech [7] extended the\nmodel of Garwin and Cross to three dimensions and also obtained consistent experimental\nresults giving the horizontal coefficient of restitution as 0.5.\nIn this paper, we consider the bouncing behaviour of a superball with spin on a flat\nsurface in more detail, using the model for the bounce described by Cross [5]. In particular,\nconditions on the initial conditions for a reversal of direction or spin of the ball are considered.\nThis is extended to finding conditions for n reversals of direction or spin for any n \u2265 1. We\nthen show that the model requires only a very small change for the case of a ball bouncing\nup and down a step or successively down a staircase. Several different examples of typical\nmotion are given for this case.\n2 The Model\n2.1 The model equations\nWe consider the motion of a superball of radius a and mass m, bouncing on a horizontal\nplane. The motion is assumed to be two-dimensional and the orientation of the coordinate\naxes in the vertical plane of motion of the centre, together with the horizontal, vertical\nand angular velocities, are shown in Fig. 1. P is the point of contact of the ball with the\nhorizontal plane in the bounce. We assume that the bounce is instantaneous and we neglect\nthe geometrical deformation of the ball during the impact as this is effectively taken into\naccount by the coefficient of restitution. During the flight of the ball between bounces any\naerodynamic or viscous effects that might arise from the motion of the ball are ignored and\nso the angular and horizontal velocities remain constant during the flight.\nA model of the bounce of a superball was described by Cross [5]. This model was\nextended by Hefner [10] to include the parabolic trajectory between bounces, and is briefly\nreviewed here. Let uj, vj and \u03c9j be the horizontal, vertical and angular velocities of the\nball respectively immediately after the jth bounce. Consider the (n + 1)th bounce; from\nthe elementary mechanics of the parabolic trajectory of the centre of the ball prior to the\n(n+1)th bounce it follows that the velocity components just before the (n+1)th bounce are\nun, \u2212vn and \u03c9n. If the normal (vertical) coefficient of restitution is \u03b2, 0 < \u03b2 < 1, then\nvn+1 = \u03b2vn. (1)\nIn the horizontal direction, it is assumed that the horizontal velocity of the ball at\nthe point of contact P is reversed and reduced in magnitude by a tangential (horizontal)\ncoefficient of restitution \u03b1, where 0 < \u03b1 < 1. This condition is expressed by\nun+1 + a\u03c9n+1 = \u2212\u03b1(un + a\u03c9n). (2)\n2\nThis model supposes that the ball instantly grips the surface at the bounce, deforms elasti-\ncally and then the motion at the point of contact reverses. What may happen in practice\nis that the ball slips slightly initially before gripping. Clearly, if this is the case, then the\nenergy put into the reversal of the ball will be reduced. However, this is effectively included\nin this model in terms of a reduced horizontal coefficient of restitution. Thus, this coefficient\nis determined by the amount of slipping and the elasticity of the ball.\nNote that \u03b1 = 0 in (2) corresponds to a model considered by Routh [14] where there is no\nslipping on impact and no elastic deformation. This case is appropriate for a hard ball which\ngrips the floor but does not permit much of the dynamics that is observed for a superball.\nThe values \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1 are also excluded since they imply that energy is conserved in the\nbounce, which is unrealistic for a real ball, and because many aspects of the dynamics are\ndifferent in this conservative case.\nA third model equation arises from the conservation of angular momentum in the bounce.\nIn order to avoid introducing the impulsive friction and normal reaction at P , we equate\nangular momenta about P before and after the impact, giving\n2\n5\nma2\u03c9n+1 \u2212maun+1 =\n2\n5\nma2\u03c9n \u2212maun. (3)\nFrom equations (2) and (3) it now follows that\nun+1 =\n1\n7\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1)un \u2212\n2\n7\n(1 + \u03b1)a\u03c9n (4)\n\u03c9n+1 = \u2212\n5\n7a\n(1 + \u03b1)un +\n1\n7\n(2\u2212 5\u03b1)\u03c9n (5)\nThese recurrence relations are to be solved, subject to some initial projection data for the\nmotion.\nSuppose that the ball is thrown with initial vertical, horizontal and angular velocities v\u02dc, u\u02dc\nand \u03c9\u02dc respectively, from a height y\u02dc. The corresponding trajectory of the ball can be followed\nbackwards in time until the ball reaches the floor, which will give the quantities immediately\nafter a non-existent zeroth bounce. These constitute the initial conditions for the iterative\nrelations (1), (4) and (5). Since the horizontal and angular velocities are constant during\nthe flight, then clearly\nu0 = u\u02dc, \u03c90 = \u03c9\u02dc,\nand v0 follows from v\u02dc and y\u02dc.\nTo determine the full trajectory of the ball, suppose that the nth bounce takes place at\ntime tn when the horizontal coordinate of the centre of the ball is xn. The horizontal velocity\nu(t) and vertical velocity v(t) during the subsequent flight of the ball are given by\nu(t) = un,\nv(t) = vn \u2212 g(t\u2212 tn), (6)\nand since y(tn) = 0, the trajectory after the n\nth bounce can be represented parametrically\nfor tn \u2264 t \u2264 tn+1 as\ny(t) = vn(t\u2212 tn)\u2212\n1\n2\ng(t\u2212 tn)\n2, (7)\nx(t) = xn + un(t\u2212 tn), (8)\nwhere (x(t), y(t)) is the position of the ball centre at time t.\n3\nTwo further results follow trivially, namely that the time and position of the (n + 1)th\nbounce are given in terms of the corresponding quantities for the nth bounce by\ntn+1 = tn +\n2vn\ng\n, (9)\nxn+1 = xn +\n2unvn\ng\n. (10)\n2.2 Non-dimensionalisation and solution\nEquations (1), (4) and (5) are non-dimensionalised with respect to v0, which must be non-\nzero for the ball to bounce at all. Thus, we define non-dimensional variables Vn, Un and \u2126n\nby\nVn =\nvn\nv0\n, Un =\nun\nv0\n, \u2126n =\na\u03c9n\nv0\n.\nIn terms of these new variables, equations (1), (4) and (5) become\nVn+1 = \u03b2Vn, (11)\nUn+1 =\n1\n7\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1)Un \u2212\n2\n7\n(1 + \u03b1)\u2126n, (12)\n\u2126n+1 = \u2212\n5\n7\n(1 + \u03b1)Un +\n1\n7\n(2\u2212 5\u03b1)\u2126n. (13)\nThe initial conditions for this iteration are\nV0 = 1, U0 =\nu0\nv0\n, \u21260 =\na\u03c90\nv0\n. (14)\nWe note that the six parameters a, \u03b1, \u03b2, u0, v0 and \u03c90 in the original equations have now\nbeen reduced to the four non-dimensional parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, u0\/v0, a\u03c90\/v0 in these equations.\nClearly equation (11) decouples from equations (12) and (13), and the solution of this\nfirst equation is given by\nVn = \u03b2\nn, (15)\nsince V0 = 1. Thus, we concentrate on (12) and (13), which can be written in matrix form\nas (\nUn+1\n\u2126n+1\n)\n=\n(\n1\n7\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1) \u22122\n7\n(1 + \u03b1)\n\u22125\n7\n(1 + \u03b1) 1\n7\n(2\u2212 5\u03b1)\n)(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n= A\n(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n, say. (16)\nIt can be proved by induction that\nAn =\n(\n1\n7\n(5 + 2(\u2212\u03b1)n) \u22122\n7\n(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1)n)\n\u22125\n7\n(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1)n) 1\n7\n(2 + 5(\u2212\u03b1)n)\n)\n,\nand hence the solution of equation (16) is given by\nUn =\n1\n7\n(5 + 2(\u2212\u03b1)n)U0 \u2212\n2\n7\n(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1)n)\u21260, (17)\n\u2126n = \u2212\n5\n7\n(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1)n)U0 +\n1\n7\n(2 + 5(\u2212\u03b1)n)\u21260, (18)\n4\nas first found (in dimensional coordinates) by Hefner [10]. We note from these solutions that\nas n\u2192\u221e,\nU\u221e =\n1\n7\n(5U0 \u2212 2\u21260), \u2126\u221e = \u2212\n1\n7\n(5U0 \u2212 2\u21260), (19)\nfor all U0 and \u21260. Note that if U\u221e 6= 0, then the bouncing motion of the ball is followed by\nthe ball rolling along the floor with initial velocity U\u221e.\nIt also follows from (17) and (18) that\nlim\nn\u2192\u221e\nUn\n\u2126n\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\u22121 if U0 6=\n2\n5\n\u21260,\n2\n5\nif U0 =\n2\n5\n\u21260.\n(20)\nThe additional equations (9) and (10) can also be non-dimensionalised by defining the\nnon-dimensional variables\nXn =\ngxn\nv20\n, Tn =\ngtn\nv0\n. (21)\nIn terms of these non-dimensional quantities, equations (9) and (10) become\nTn+1 = Tn + 2Vn, (22)\nXn+1 = Xn + 2UnVn. (23)\nThese equations can be used to calculate the total time, Ttot, measured from the first\nbounce at T1 to T\u221e, Xn and the final horizontal positional coordinate, X\u221e, of the ball. The\nresults are\nTtot =\n2\u03b2\n1\u2212 \u03b2\n,\nXn = X1 +\n2\n7\n(\n\u03b2(1\u2212 \u03b2n\u22121)\n1\u2212 \u03b2\n(5U0 \u2212 2\u21260)\u2212\n2\u03b1\u03b2(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1\u03b2)n\u22121)\n1 + \u03b1\u03b2\n(U0 + \u21260)\n)\n, (24)\nX\u221e = X1 +\n2\u03b2\n7\n(\n5U0 \u2212 2\u21260\n1\u2212 \u03b2\n\u2212\n2\u03b1(U0 + \u21260)\n1 + \u03b1\u03b2\n)\n. (25)\nIn terms of the original coordinates, the total time taken is given by\nttot =\n2\u03b2v0\ng(1\u2212 \u03b2)\n,\nand the final position of the ball is given by\nx\u221e = x1 +\n2\u03b2v0\n7g\n(\n5u0 \u2212 2a\u03c90\n1\u2212 \u03b2\n\u2212\n2\u03b1(u0 + a\u03c90)\n1 + \u03b1\u03b2\n)\n.\nWe note that both the total time and the displacement x\u221e \u2212 x1 are both finite and are\ndirectly proportional to v0 and that the total time is independent of u0 and \u03c90.\n3 Eigenmodes\nThe eigenvalues of the matrix A are \u03bb1 = 1 and \u03bb2 = \u2212\u03b1, with corresponding eigenvectors\nx1 = (1,\u22121)\nT and x2 = (2\/5, 1)\nT . Since the eigenvalues are distinct, the eigenvectors form\na basis for R2, and the initial conditions can be written as(\nU0\n\u21260\n)\n= c1x1 + c2x2, (26)\n5\nfor some constants c1 and c2. It follows from this that(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n= c1\u03bb\nn\n1x1 + c2\u03bb\nn\n2x2.\nSubstituting for the eigenvalues gives\n(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n= c1x1 + c2(\u2212\u03b1)\nnx2, (27)\nThe solutions given in (17) and (18) can be identified with this eigenvector basis as they can\nbe rewritten as(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n=\n1\n7\n(5U0 \u2212 2\u21260)\n(\n1\n\u22121\n)\n+\n5\n7\n(U0 + \u21260)(\u2212\u03b1)\nn\n(\n2\/5\n1\n)\n,\ngiving\nc1 =\n1\n7\n(5U0 \u2212 2\u21260), c2 =\n5\n7\n(U0 + \u21260).\nThus, all solutions are a linear combination of the two eigenmodes associated with either\nc1 = 0 or c2 = 0, and to understand all the possible solutions it is sufficient to understand\nthe eigenmodes.\n3.1 First eigenmode (\u03bb1 = 1)\nIf c2 = 0, then c1x1 = (U0,\u21260)\nT which implies that U0 = \u2212\u21260. In this case,(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n=\n(\nU0\n\u21260\n)\nfor all n\nand so Un = \u2212\u2126n for all n also.\nThis motion corresponds to the case when the horizontal velocity of the lowest point P of\nthe ball at impact is zero at each bounce and hence must be zero during the flight also. This\nis essentially a rolling motion in the horizontal direction, combined with the up and down\nmotion between bounces in the vertical direction associated with the parabolic trajectory.\nWe refer to this as the rolling mode.\n3.2 Second eigenmode (\u03bb2 = \u2212\u03b1)\nIf c1 = 0, then c2x2 = (U0,\u21260)\nT which implies that U0 =\n2\n5\n\u21260. In this case,\n(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n= (\u2212\u03b1)n\n(\nU0\n\u21260\n)\nand also Un =\n2\n5\n\u2126n for all n. Clearly, this motion has a change of sign for both Un and \u2126n\nat each iteration, corresponding to a change of horizontal direction and spin at each bounce.\nThis motion can be understood more easily by considering Xn, the horizontal position of\nthe nth bounce. Combining (24), (25) and using U0 =\n2\n5\n\u21260 gives\nXn \u2212X\u221e = \u2212\n2(\u2212\u03b1\u03b2)n\n1 + \u03b1\u03b2\nU0.\n6\nSince \u03b1\u03b2 > 0, the difference Xn \u2212 X\u221e alternates in sign at every iteration, which implies\nthat the bounces of the ball alternate either side of X\u221e while converging to X\u221e as n\u2192\u221e\nsince \u03b1\u03b2 < 1. We refer to this as the oscillating mode.\nWhen \u03b1 = 0, as considered by Routh [14], the second eigenvalue is also zero and so,\nafter the first bounce of the ball, the motion consists of only the single rolling mode. This\nexplains why this model cannot exhibit all the dynamics observed for a superball.\nThe two eigenmodes form a basis for all motions of the ball, since all other cases are\na linear combination of these two fundamental modes, and provide a useful framework for\nunderstanding the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions. However, the transient motion\ninvolves a combination of the rolling and oscillating modes and may result in a finite number\nof direction or spin reversals, a situation which we explore in more detail in the next section.\n4 Direction and Spin Reversal\nA bouncing superball with spin can be observed to reverse both its (horizontal) direction\nand spin a number of times before settling down to a more regular bouncing motion in one\ndirection. We consider what we can derive from the model regarding these reversals.\nAt the nth bounce there will be a change in the horizontal direction of motion of the ball\nif Un+1Un < 0. Substituting for Un+1 from (12) this becomes(\n1\n7\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1)Un \u2212\n2\n7\n(1 + \u03b1)\u2126n\n)\nUn < 0.\nA necessary condition for this to hold is that Un 6= 0 and so we divide by 2(1 + \u03b1)U\n2\nn > 0 to\ngive\n\u2126n\nUn\n>\n5\u2212 2\u03b1\n2(1 + \u03b1)\n. (28)\nNote that since 0 < \u03b1 < 1, (5\u2212 2\u03b1)\/2(1 + \u03b1) > 0. Thus, we can rewrite condition (28) for\nreversal of direction of the ball as\n0 <\nUn\n\u2126n\n<\n2(1 + \u03b1)\n5\u2212 2\u03b1\n. (29)\nThe left-hand inequality occurs as there is an implicit requirement in (28) that \u2126n\/Un is\nfinite.\nSimilarly, there will be a change in spin of the ball if \u2126n+1\u2126n < 0. Substituting for \u2126n+1\nfrom (13) this condition becomes\n(\n5\n7\n(1 + \u03b1)Un \u2212\n1\n7\n(2\u2212 5\u03b1)\u2126n\n)\n\u2126n < 0.\nA necessary condition for this to hold is that \u2126n 6= 0 and so we divide by 5(1 +\u03b1)\u2126\n2\nn > 0 to\ngive the condition for reversal of spin of the ball as\n2\u2212 5\u03b1\n5(1 + \u03b1)\n<\nUn\n\u2126n\n. (30)\nCombining (29) and (30), we conclude that there will be a reversal in both direction and\nspin if\nmax\n(\n0,\n2\u2212 5\u03b1\n5(1 + \u03b1)\n)\n<\nUn\n\u2126n\n<\n2(1 + \u03b1)\n5\u2212 2\u03b1\n.

Upper and lower boundaries\nfor direction reversal (blue); lower boundary for spin reversal (red).\nThe boundaries for direction and spin reversal as a function of \u03b1 are shown in Fig. 2 and\nthese boundaries divide the strip 0 < \u03b1 < 1, \u2212\u221e < Un\/\u2126n < \u221e into five regions. Writing\np = 2(1 + \u03b1)\/(5\u2212 2\u03b1) and q = (2\u2212 5\u03b1)\/5(1 + \u03b1), we have:\n1. p < Un\/\u2126n <\u221e : spin reversal only;\n2. max(0, q) < Un\/\u2126n < p : spin and direction reversal;\n3. 0 < Un\/\u2126n < q with \u03b1 <\n2\n5\n: direction reversal only;\n4. q < Un\/\u2126n < 0 with \u03b1 >\n2\n5\n: spin reversal only;\n5. \u2212\u221e < Un\/\u2126n < min(0, q): neither spin nor direction reversal.\nIt is worth noting that if \u03b1 > 2\/5 then every direction reversal is accompanied by a spin\nreversal, but if \u03b1 < 2\/5 then in region 3 there is reversal of direction but not of spin.\n5 The Number of Reversals\nWe now consider how many bounces will involve a change of direction or spin for given\ninitial values of U0 and \u21260. We start by observing that the previous conditions on reversal\nof direction and spin involved only the single quantity \u03c4n = Un\/\u2126n. Moreover, the dynamics\nof this quantity is determined by a one-dimensional map, found by dividing (12) by (13) to\ngive\n\u03c4n+1 =\nUn+1\n\u2126n+1\n=\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1)Un \u2212 2(1 + \u03b1)\u2126n\n\u22125(1 + \u03b1)Un + (2\u2212 5\u03b1)\u2126n\n=\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1)\u03c4n \u2212 2(1 + \u03b1)\n\u22125(1 + \u03b1)\u03c4n + (2\u2212 5\u03b1)\n. (32)\n(32) can be regarded as a bilinear mapping of a (real) one-dimensional projective line to\nitself with \u03c4 as a projective parameter.\n8\n-1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5\n\u03b8\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\ng(\u03b8)\nFigure 3: The function g(\u03b8) for \u03b1 = 0.5. Also shown is the line y = x, the upper boundary in \u03b8 for direction\nreversal (- - - - -) and the lower boundary in \u03b8 for spin reversal (\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212). The two fixed points can be\nseen where the curve g(\u03b8) intercepts the line y = x.\n5.1 \u03b8-dynamics\nThe problem with working with the variable \u03c4n in (32) is that it is defined on the whole of the\nreal line, and as \u2126n \u2192 0, \u03c4n \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. A more convenient form for this one-dimensional map\ncan be obtained by transforming the coordinates Un and \u2126n to polar coordinates (Rn, \u03b8n):\nUn = Rn sin \u03b8n, \u2126n = Rn cos \u03b8n. (33)\nIn these coordinates, \u03c4n = tan \u03b8n and, in terms of \u03b8n, the map is\n\u03b8n+1 = g(\u03b8n) = tan\n\u22121\n(\n(5\u2212 2\u03b1) tan \u03b8n \u2212 2(1 + \u03b1)\n\u22125(1 + \u03b1) tan \u03b8n + 2\u2212 5\u03b1\n)\n. (34)\nThe function g(\u03b8), \u2212pi\/2 < \u03b8 \u2264 pi\/2, is shown in Fig. 3 for \u03b1 = 0.5.\nSome remarks about (32) and (34) are appropriate. Since tan \u03b8 has period pi, (34) is\nperiodic for \u03b8n \u2208 (\u2212\n\u03c0\n2\n, \u03c0\n2\n]; also, all inequalities involving U\/\u2126 are preserved when transformed\nto \u03b8 since tan \u03b8 is a monotonically increasing function. Further, the two maps (32) and (34)\nare topologically conjugate since they are related by the invertible transformation \u03c4n =\ntan \u03b8n. Thus, the dynamics of the two maps is essentially the same as the iterates are related\nby this invertible coordinate transformation. This means that we can work with either map\nand we often find it convenient to work with the map (32). It is also apparent that the\niterates \u03b8n are well defined for all n except in the degenerate case of U0 = \u21260 = 0, and that\nsince the linear equations (16) are invertible and the transformation function Un\/\u2126n = tan \u03b8n\nis also invertible, then g must also be invertible.\n9\nIn terms of \u03b8n, the condition (29) for direction reversal at a bounce is given by\n0 < \u03b8n < tan\n\u22121\n(\n2(1 + \u03b1)\n5\u2212 2\u03b1\n)\n. (35)\nSimilarly, the condition (30) for spin reversal is\ntan\u22121\n(\n2\u2212 5\u03b1\n5(1 + \u03b1)\n)\n< \u03b8n <\npi\n2\n. (36)\nThe right-hand inequality arises from the implicit assumption that Un\/\u2126n in (30) is finite.\nIf (Un,\u2126n)\nT is chosen to be an eigenvector of the matrix A, then\n(\nUn+1\n\u2126n+1\n)\n= \u03bb\n(\nUn\n\u2126n\n)\n,\nwhere \u03bb is the corresponding eigenvalue. In terms of the polar coordinates defined by (33),\nthis eigenvector case corresponds to\nRn+1 = \u03bbRn, \u03b8n+1 = \u03b8n.\nThus, eigenvectors are associated with fixed points of the one-dimensional map (34).\nLemma 5.1\nThe map (34) has two fixed points which are given by\n\u03b8\u22171 = tan\n\u22121(\u22121) = \u2212\npi\n4\nand \u03b8\u22172 = tan\n\u22121\n(\n2\n5\n)\n= 0.380506. (37)\nMoreover, \u03b8\u22171 is stable and \u03b8\n\u2217\n2 is unstable for all values of \u03b1 and limn\u2192\u221e\n\u03b8n = \u03b8\n\u2217\n1 if \u03b80 6= \u03b8\n\u2217\n2.\nProof\nFixed points of g are associated with the two eigenvectors of the matrixA. For the eigenvector\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb1 = 1, we have Un\/\u2126n = \u22121 for all n; thus, there is\na fixed point of g at \u03b8\u22171 = tan\n\u22121(\u22121) = \u2212\u03c0\n4\n. For the eigenvector corresponding to the\neigenvalue \u03bb2 = \u2212\u03b1, we have Un\/\u2126n =\n2\n5\nfor all n and so there is a fixed point of g at\n\u03b8\u22172 = tan\n\u22121(2\/5) = 0.380506. Clearly these fixed points can also be found by solving the\nequation \u03b8 = g(\u03b8) or (32) with \u03c4n+1 = \u03c4n = \u03c4 , say, but the above approach highlights the\nrelationship between the fixed points of g and the eigenvectors of A. Further, the fixed points\nof g are independent of \u03b1 since the eigenvectors of A are themselves independent of \u03b1.\nTo determine the stability of these fixed points, we require g\u2032(\u03b8\u22171,2). Now from (34), an\nelementary calculation shows that\ng\u2032(\u03b8) =\n\u221249\u03b1 sec2 \u03b8\n{\u22125(1 + \u03b1) tan \u03b8 + (2\u2212 5\u03b1)}2 sec2(g(\u03b8))\n. (38)\nIf \u03b8\u2217 is a fixed point of g, then g(\u03b8\u2217) = \u03b8\u2217, whence\ng\u2032(\u03b8\u2217) =\n\u221249\u03b1\n{\u22125(1 + \u03b1) tan \u03b8\u2217 + (2\u2212 5\u03b1)}2\n.\n10\nEvaluating this derivative for the two fixed points of g given in (37), we find that\ng\u2032(\u03b8\u22171) = \u2212\u03b1 and g\n\u2032(\u03b8\u22172) = \u2212\n1\n\u03b1\n.\nSince 0 < \u03b1 < 1, we conclude that the fixed point \u03b8\u22171 = \u2212\n\u03c0\n4\nis stable for all values of \u03b1 while\nthe other fixed point \u03b8\u22172 = tan\n\u22121(2\n5\n) is unstable for all values of \u03b1. It also follows from the\nasymptotic behaviour (20) that if \u03b80 6= \u03b8\n\u2217\n2, then limn\u2192\u221e \u03b8n = \u03b8\n\u2217\n1.\nIn Lemma 5.1, we have established that the function g has two fixed points and that\niterates converge to \u03b8\u22171 for all initial conditions \u03b80 6= \u03b8\n\u2217\n2. We now consider the way that the\niterates converge to \u03b8\u22171. To do this, we note that \u03b8 is a periodic variable with period pi and so\nwe consider the phase space for \u03b8 to be a circle of circumference pi. On this circle, there are\nthe two fixed points given in Lemma 5.1. We divide the circle (excluding the fixed points)\ninto the two parts I1 = (\u03b8\n\u2217\n1, \u03b8\n\u2217\n2) and I2 = (\u03b8\n\u2217\n2, \u03b8\n\u2217\n1).\nTheorem 5.2\n(i) g(I1) = I2 and g(I2) = I1 and so if \u03b8n \u2208 I1(I2), then \u03b8n+1 \u2208 I2(I1).\n(ii) The intervals I1 and I2 are invariant under g\n2, i.e. g2(I1) = I1 and g\n2(I2) = I2.\n(iii) If \u03b80 6= \u03b8\n\u2217\n2, then the even and the odd iterates of \u03b8n converge monotonically on the\ncircle to \u03b8\u22171.\nProof\n(i) Rather than taking the interval for the pi-periodic function \u03b8 as (\u2212\u03c0\n2\n, \u03c0\n2\n], we take instead\nthe interval [\u03b8\u22172, \u03b8\n\u2217\n2+pi) = {\u03b8\n\u2217\n2}\u222a I2\u222a{\u03b8\n\u2217\n1}\u222a I1. The function g on this interval is shown\nin Fig. 4 for \u03b1 = 0.5. Now\n\u03b8n+1 \u2212 \u03b8\n\u2217\n1 = g(\u03b8n)\u2212 g(\u03b8\n\u2217\n1) = g\n\u2032(cn)(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8\n\u2217\n1), (39)\nby the Mean Value Theorem for some cn between \u03b8n and \u03b8\n\u2217\n1. It can be seen from (38)\nthat g\u2032(\u03b8) < 0 for all values of \u03b8 and so, in particular, g\u2032(cn) < 0, whatever the value\nof cn may be. It thus follows from (39) that\n(\u03b8n+1 \u2212 \u03b8\n\u2217\n1)(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8\n\u2217\n1) < 0,\nand hence that\ng(I1) = I2 and g(I2) = I1.\n(ii) This follows immediately from (i).\n(iii) The intervals I1 and I2 will each contain either the even or the odd iterates since these\nintervals are invariant under g2 by (ii). Since g is invertible and the iterates converge\nto \u03b8\u22171 as n\u2192\u221e from Lemma 5.1, then the result follows.\nThe dynamics of \u03b8 on the circle which is described in Lemma 5.1 and Theorem 5.2 is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 5.\nWe note that \u03b8\u22172 corresponds to a fixed point of (32) given by\nU\u2217\n2\n\u2126\u2217\n2\n= 2\n5\n. This unstable\nfixed point is contained in the interval where there is reversal of both direction and spin\n11\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n\u03b8\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\ng(\u03b8)\nFigure 4: The function g defined on the interval [\u03b8\u22172, \u03b8\n\u2217\n2 + pi) for \u03b1 = 0.5.\ngiven by (31) for all 0 < \u03b1 < 1. To see this, we note that the upper and lower boundaries\nin (31) both converge to 2\n5\nas \u03b1\u2192 0. Moreover, it is easy to see that the upper boundary is\nmonotonically increasing and the lower boundary is monotonically decreasing as \u03b1 increases.\nThis can also be seen from the plot of these boundaries shown in Fig. 2. Thus, the fixed\npoint must always lie between these boundaries.\n5.2 Direction reversals\nFrom (35) the condition for a direction reversal at the nth bounce is \u03b8l < \u03b8n < \u03b8r, where\n\u03b8l = 0 and \u03b8r = tan\n\u22121{2(1+\u03b1)\/(5\u2212 2\u03b1)} are the left- and right-hand points of the interval.\nDefine Id = (\u03b8\u2113, \u03b8r), the interval associated with direction reversals; then from (34),\ng(\u03b8r) = \u03b8\u2113, (40)\nthat is \u03b8r corresponds to the back iterate of the left-hand boundary point \u03b8l.\nWe now back-iterate \u03b8r, so that\ng(\u03b81\u2113 ) = \u03b8r; (41)\nit is found that \u03b81\u2113 = tan\n\u22121{2(1\u2212\u03b12)\/(5+2\u03b12)}. If \u03b80 \u2208 (\u03b8\u2113, \u03b8\n1\n\u2113 ), then \u03b81 = g(\u03b80) 6\u2208 Id. Thus,\nthere is only one direction reversal in this case. Similarly, we can back-iterate \u03b81\u2113 , so that\ng(\u03b81r) = \u03b8\n1\n\u2113 ,\nwith \u03b81r = tan\n\u22121{2(1+\u03b13)\/(5\u2212 2\u03b13)}. Now if \u03b80 \u2208 (\u03b8\n1\nr , \u03b8r), then \u03b81 \u2208 (\u03b8\u2113, \u03b8\n1\n\u2113 ) and so \u03b82 6\u2208 Id.\nIn this case, there are two direction reversals. By continuing this process of back iteration,\nsuccessive intervals can be found which are associated with a particular number of direction\nreversals.\nAs the iterates of g oscillate either side of \u03b8\u22172 by Theorem 5.2, then clearly the back iterates\nwill oscillate in a similar way. Also, as \u03b8\u22172 is an unstable fixed point for g (see Lemma 5.1),\n12\n\u03b82\n\u2217\n\u03b81\n\u2217\n\u03b80\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\n\u03b83\n\u03b84\n\u03b85\n\u03b86\u03b87\n\u03b8=0\u03b8=\u2212pi\/2, \u03b8=pi\/2\n\u03b8=pi\/4\n\u03b8=\u2212pi\/4\nFigure 5: The dynamics on the circle.\nthen it must be a stable fixed point for g\u22121, and so the back iterates will converge towards\n\u03b8\u22172 as n \u2192 \u221e. Clearly the size of the interval associated with n reversals of direction will\nreduce as n increases.\nTo calculate the boundaries of the intervals associated with a particular number of direc-\ntion reversals, it is more convenient to work with the two linear equations (16) rather than\nthe single nonlinear equation (34). Inverting the matrix A, the inverse of the map (16) is\ngiven by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed Un\n\u2126n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 = \u2212 1\n7\u03b1\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 2\u2212 5\u03b1 2(1 + \u03b1)\n5(1 + \u03b1) 5\u2212 2\u03b1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed Un+1\n\u2126n+1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 = B\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed Un+1\n\u2126n+1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , say.\nWe prefer to write this map as a forward iteration in terms of the new variables U\u02dcn and \u2126\u02dcn:\uf8eb\n\uf8ed U\u02dcn+1\n\u2126\u02dcn+1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 = B\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed U\u02dcn\n\u2126\u02dcn\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (42)\nIt is easily shown that, for integer m,\nBm =\n(\u22121)m\n7\u03b1m\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 2 + 5(\u2212\u03b1)m 2(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1)m)\n5(1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b1)m) 5 + 2(\u2212\u03b1)m\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (43)\nand, using (43) with m = 2n, it follows that\nU\u02dc2n\n\u2126\u02dc2n\n=\n(2 + 5\u03b12n)U\u02dc0 + 2(1\u2212 \u03b1\n2n)\u2126\u02dc0\n5(1\u2212 \u03b12n)U\u02dc0 + (5 + 2\u03b12n)\u2126\u02dc0\n. (44)\nSetting U\u02dc0 = 0 gives\nU\u02dc2n\n\u2126\u02dc2n\n=\n2(1\u2212 \u03b12n)\n5 + 2\u03b12n\n. (45)\n13\nFor n = 1, 2, . . ., (45) gives the boundary points to the left of the fixed point \u03c4 \u2217 = 2\/5 of\n(32) (this is an unstable fixed point of (32) and hence a stable fixed point of the inverse of\n(32)). Thus, we conclude that if\n2(1\u2212 \u03b12n\u22122)\n5 + 2\u03b12n\u22122\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n<\n2(1\u2212 \u03b12n)\n5 + 2\u03b12n\n, (46)\nthen there will be 2n\u2212 1 direction reversals, n = 1, 2, . . .\nSimilarly, from (43) with m = 2n\u2212 1, it follows that\nU\u02dc2n\u22121\n\u2126\u02dc2n\u22121\n=\n(2\u2212 5\u03b12n\u22121)U\u02dc0 + 2(1 + \u03b1\n2n\u22121)\u2126\u02dc0\n5(1 + \u03b12n\u22121)U\u02dc0 + (5\u2212 2\u03b12n\u22121)\u2126\u02dc0\n. (47)\nSetting U\u02dc0 = 0 then gives\nU\u02dc2n\u22121\n\u2126\u02dc2n\u22121\n=\n2(1 + \u03b12n\u22121)\n5\u2212 2\u03b12n\u22121\nand, by an argument similar to that leading to (46), there will be 2n direction reversals,\nn = 1, 2, . . . , if\n2(1 + \u03b12n+1)\n5\u2212 2\u03b12n+1\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n<\n2(1 + \u03b12n\u22121)\n5\u2212 2\u03b12n\u22121\n, (48)\nThe boundaries for the different regions of direction reversals are shown in Fig. 6.\nIt is easily seen from (46) and (48) that if 0 < U0\/\u21260 < 2\/5, then there will be an odd\nnumber of direction reversals of the ball, whereas if 2\/5 < U0\/\u21260 < 2(1 + \u03b1)\/(5\u2212 2\u03b1), then\nthere will be an even number of direction reversals of the ball. The \u2018permanance\u2019 of the\nmotion after the cessation of direction reversals is illuminated by the following result.\nTheorem 5.3\nFor the bouncing ball, once direction reversals have ended, they cannot start again.\nProof\nIn the description of the \u03b8-dynamics earlier in this section, we noted that there is a particular\ninterval in Id, the interval associated with direction reversals, where the next iterate escapes\nfrom Id. To be precise, if \u03b8n \u2208 (\u03b8\u2113, \u03b8\n1\n\u2113 ) \u2282 Id, then \u03b8n+1 6\u2208 Id, where \u03b8\u2113 and \u03b8\n1\n\u2113 are defined in\n(40) and (41) respectively. In this case, it follows that \u03b8n+1 \u2208 (\u03b8r, g\n2(\u03b8r)).\nContinuing to iterate, we note that \u03b8n+2 \u2208 (g\n2(\u03b81\u2113 ), \u03b8\u2113). This interval must have no\nintersection with Id since the iterates of g\n2 move monotonically away from \u03b8\u22172 and towards\n\u03b8\u22171 by Theorem 5.2. All subsequent iterates will move further from \u03b8\n\u2217\n2 and towards \u03b8\n\u2217\n1 and so\nthey will never enter Id again. Thus, once the iterates escape from Id they will never return,\nwhich proves the stated result.\nIt follows from the results of this section that if the number of direction reversals is even,\nthen the ball will settle down to motion in the same direction as the initial velocity U0,\nwhereas, if the number of direction reversals is odd, then the ball will settle down to motion\nin the opposite direction to the initial velocity U0.\n5.3 Spin reversals\nThe analysis of spin reversals is similar to that for direction reversals. For n = 1, 2, . . ., the\nboundary between there being a reversal of spin and no reversal occurs at the point \u2126n = 0,\n14\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n\u03b1\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nU\/\u2126\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nFigure 6: The boundaries which define regions associated with different numbers of direction\nreversals.

The fixed point at U\n\u2126\n= 2\n5\nis also shown (\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212).\nwhich corresponds to \u03b8n =\n\u03c0\n2\n. To find intervals associated with a particular number of spin\nreversals, we back iterate this point. These iterates will again oscillate either side of the fixed\npoint \u03b8\u22172 and will converge to this fixed point as n \u2192 \u221e, resulting in successively smaller\nintervals.\nSetting \u2126\u02dc0 = 0 in (44) and following the arguments of the previous section, it is found\nthat if\n2 + 5\u03b12n\n5(1\u2212 \u03b12n)\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n<\n2 + 5\u03b12n\u22122\n5(1\u2212 \u03b12n\u22122)\n, (49)\nthen there are 2n \u2212 1 spin reversals, n = 2, 3, . . .. We note that when n = 1, the term on\nthe right-hand side of this inequality involves a division by zero, reflecting the fact that it\ncorresponds to the point \u21260 = 0. Thus, for n = 1, there is only one condition, namely\n2 + 5\u03b12\n5(1\u2212 \u03b12)\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n, (50)\nand this range results in a single reversal of spin. Similarly, setting \u2126\u02dc0 = 0 in (47) gives the\ncondition that if\n2\u2212 5\u03b12n\u22121\n5(1 + \u03b12n\u22121)\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n<\n2\u2212 5\u03b12n+1\n5(1 + \u03b12n+1)\n, (51)\nthen there will be 2n spin reversals, n = 1, 2, . . .. It follows from (49) and (51) that if\n(2\u22125\u03b1)\/5(1 + \u03b1) < U0\/\u21260 < 2\/5, there will be an even number of spin reversals of the ball,\nwhereas if 2\/5 < U0\/\u21260, there will be an odd number of spin reversals.\nThe boundaries for the different regions of spin reversals are shown in Fig. 7, together with\nthe boundaries of the region where there is direction reversal. Fig. 8 shows the boundaries\nfor direction and spin reversal superimposed. The condition under which there are spin\nreversals without direction reversal is provided by the following lemma:\n16\nLemma 5.4\nFor \u03b1 > (2\/5)1\/(2n\u22121), there are values of U0\/\u21260 where there are 2n \u2212 1 or 2n reversals of\nspin but no direction reversals.\nProof\nFrom Fig. 7 it can be seen that the regions for different numbers of spin reversals move\noutside of the direction reversal area for sufficiently large \u03b1. The boundary for 2n spin\nreversals crosses the lower boundary for direction reversals when\n2\u2212 5\u03b12n\u22121\n5(1 + \u03b12n\u22121)\n= 0,\nthat is when \u03b1 = (2\/5)1\/(2n\u22121). Similarly, the boundary for 2n\u2212 1 spin reversals crosses the\nupper boundary for direction reversals when\n2 + 5\u03b12n\n5(1\u2212 \u03b12n)\n=\n2(1 + \u03b1)\n5\u2212 2\u03b1\n,\nand this equation also simplifies to 2\u2212 5\u03b12n\u22121 = 0, that is \u03b1 = (2\/5)1\/(2n\u22121).\nUsing a method analogous to that of Theorem 5.3 , it is easily shown that once spin\nreversals have ended, they cannot start again. If the number of spin reversals is even, then\nthe ball will settle down to having spin in the same direction as the initial spin \u21260 whereas,\nif the number of spin reversals is odd, then the ball will settle down to having spin in the\nopposite direction to the initial spin \u21260. We further note that if U0\/\u21260 is changed so that\nits value crosses one of the boundaries we have defined relating to reversal of either direction\nor spin, then there will be an increase or decrease of two in the number of reversals. This\nis due to the oscillating nature of the solutions arising from the second eigenmode. See the\nexamples in Section 7 to observe this effect.\n6 The Special Case \u03b1 = 2\/5\nWhen \u03b1 = 2\/5, there is a strong correlation between reversals of direction and spin. To see\nthis, we note that in this case the boundaries for direction reversal are given by\nU\u02dcd2n\u22121\n\u2126\u02dcd2n\u22121\n=\n2[1 + (2\n5\n)2n\u22121]\n5\u2212 2(2\n5\n)2n\u22121\n,\nU\u02dcd2n\n\u2126\u02dcd2n\n=\n2[1\u2212 (2\n5\n)2n]\n5 + 2(2\n5\n)2n\n,\nwhere the superscript d denotes direction reversal. Similarly, the boundaries for spin reversal\nare supplied by\nU\u02dcs2n\u22121\n\u2126\u02dcs2n\u22121\n=\n2\u2212 5(2\n5\n)2n\u22121\n5[1 + (2\n5\n)2n\u22121]\n,\nU\u02dcs2n\n\u2126\u02dcs2n\n=\n2 + 5(2\n5\n)2n\n5[1\u2212 (2\n5\n)2n]\n.\nPlainly,\nU\u02dcd2n\u22121\n\u2126\u02dcd2n\u22121\n=\nU\u02dcs2n\n\u2126\u02dcs2n\nand\nU\u02dcd2n\n\u2126\u02dcd2n\n=\nU\u02dcs2n\u22121\n\u2126\u02dcs2n\u22121\n. (52)\nThus, in this special case, the boundaries of spin and direction reversal coincide. A number\nof results follow from this observation.\n17\nTheorem 6.1\nIf \u03b1 = 2\/5, then\n(i) there will be one reversal of spin and no direction reversals if U0\/\u21260 > 2\/3;\n(ii) there will be 2n reversals of spin and 2n\u2212 1 direction reversals, n = 1, 2, . . ., if\n2(1\u2212 (2\n5\n)2n\u22122)\n5 + 2(2\n5\n)2n\u22122\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n<\n2(1\u2212 (2\n5\n)2n)\n5 + 2(2\n5\n)2n\n;\n(iii) there will be 2n+ 1 reversals of spin and 2n direction reversals, n = 1, 2, . . . if\n2(1 + (2\n5\n)2n+1)\n5\u2212 2(2\n5\n)2n+1\n<\nU0\n\u21260\n<\n2(1 + (2\n5\n)2n\u22121)\n5\u2212 2(2\n5\n)2n\u22121\n;\n(iv) the number of reversals of spin is one more than the number of direction reversals;\n(v) once reversals have finished (assuming that U0\/\u21260 6= 2\/5), either the direction or the\nspin will be in a different direction from the initial direction, but not both.\nProof\n(i) This result follows immediately by setting \u03b1 = 2\/5 in (29) and (50).\n(ii) This follows by setting \u03b1 = 2\/5 in (46) and (51), noting the first relation in (52).\n(iii) Setting \u03b1 = 2\/5 in (48) and (49), and noting the second relation in (52) gives (iii).\n(iv) This is immediate from (i) through (iii).\n(v) This result follows from the previous one as an even or odd number of reversals imply\nthat the final direction is the same as or opposite to the inital direction.\n7 Examples\nTo illustrate these results, we take the two coefficients of restitution to be \u03b2 = 0.9 and\n\u03b1 = 0.5, which are close to the experimental values obtained by Cross [6]. The initial\nvalues of U0 and \u21260 can now be chosen to give different numbers of direction and spin\nreversals. Taking U0 = 0.36 and \u21260 = 1 gives U0\/\u21260 = 0.36, which corresponds to 3\nreversals of direction and 6 reversals of spin, whilst choosing U0 = 0.38 gives U0\/\u21260 = 0.38,\ncorresponding to 5 reversals of direction but still 6 reversals of spin. The results in these\ntwo cases are shown in Figs 9 and 10. We note from (19) that when U0\/\u21260 = 0.36, the\nlimiting values for Un and \u2126n as n \u2192 \u221e are given by U\u221e = \u2212\u2126\u221e = \u22120.02857 and are\nU\u221e = \u2212\u2126\u221e = \u22120.01429 when U0\/\u21260 = 0.38.\nIn Figs 9(a) and 10(a), the movement of the \u03b8n-iterates away from the fixed point \u03b8\n\u2217\n2 and\ntowards the fixed point \u03b8\u22171 can be seen. In addition, in Figs 9(b) and 10(b), the monotonic\nconvergence of the even and odd \u03b8n-iterates to the fixed point \u03b8\n\u2217\n1 is evident.\n18\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nn\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n\u03b8\n(a)\n\u03b81\n\u2217\n\u03b82\n\u2217\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nn\n1\n2\n3\n\u03b8\n(b)\n\u03b81\n\u2217\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nn\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nV\nU\n\u2126\n(c) (d)\nFigure 9: Results for U0\n\u21260\n= 0.36.

Thus, the centre of the ball when bouncing in x > 0\nis incident with the x-axis and the y-axis coincides with the step up or down in level. The\nhalf-planes are assumed to have the same tangential and normal coefficients of restitution,\na restriction which is easily removed. Non-dimensional vertical distances can be defined by\ndivision by v20\/g in a similar way to the horizontal distance X in (21).\nConsider the case of two bounces of the ball, where the first occurs at the level y = \u2212a\nand the second at y = h \u2212 a. We note that, since the horizontal velocity and spin are\n19\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nn\n-1.5\n-1\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n\u03b8\n(a)\n\u03b81\n\u2217\n\u03b82\n\u2217\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nn\n1\n2\n3\n\u03b8\n(b)\n\u03b81\n\u2217\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nn\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nV\nU\n\u2126\n(c) (d)\nFigure 10: Results for U0\n\u21260\n= 0.38.

Half of the trajectory after the non-existent\nzeroth bounce is shown.\nconstant during the flight of the ball, (12) and (13) also apply in this case. Clearly there is\na difference in the vertical direction and so there must be a change in equation (11).\nLet vn be the vertical velocity immediately after the n\nth bounce at level y = \u2212a and let\nvn+1 be the vertical velocity after the (n+ 1)\nth bounce at level y = h\u2212 a. Then\nvn+1 = \u2212\u03b2v\n\u2212\nn+1, (53)\nwhere v\u2212n+1 < 0 is the vertical velocity immediately before the (n + 1)\nth bounce. The latter\nfollows from conservation of energy expressed (omitting contributions common to both sides)\nby the equation\n1\n2\nmv2n =\n1\n2\nmv\u2212n+1\n2\n+mgh.\nThus,\nv\u2212n+1 = \u2212\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2gh, (54)\nand substituting this value into (53) gives\nvn+1 = \u03b2\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2gh,\n20\na result which trivially requires that v2n > 2gh (if this condition is not satisfied, the ball has\ninsufficient energy to reach the step height). Dividing this equation by v0, we obtain the\ncorresponding non-dimensional equation\nVn+1 = \u03b2\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212 2H, (55)\nwhere H = gh\/v20 is a non-dimensional height parameter and (55) requires that V\n2\nn > 2H .\nIt is of interest to consider more closely the conditions for the ball to be able to mount the\nstep after the nth bounce. Suppose that h > 0 and that, at the nth bounce at the lower level,\nthe centre of the ball is (xn, 0) with xn > a. Then the equation of the ensuing trajectory of\nits centre is\ny =\nvn\nun\n(x\u2212 xn)\u2212\ng\n2u2n\n(x\u2212 xn)\n2. (56)\nDefine\nx\u00b1n = \u2212\nun\ng\n{\nvn \u00b1\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2gh\n}\n, (57)\nthe two values of xn which make y = h when x = 0 in (56). In the situation envisaged un\nis negative and hence, assuming that v2n > 2gh, x\n\u00b1\nn are both positive. A necessary condition\nfor the ball to mount the step is then x\u2212n < xn < x\n+\nn . However, this condition is not sufficient\nas the ball may still hit the corner of the step as it rises for some x > 0.\nTo avoid such a collision, let x\u2212n +\u03b4 be the abscissa of the centre of the ball when launched\nfrom the lower level in such a way that the parabolic trajectory touches the quarter circle\nx2 + (y \u2212 h+ a)2 = a2, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 a, h\u2212 a \u2264 y \u2264 h. (58)\nThe detailed calculation of \u03b4 in terms of the geometrical and launch data is difficult, involving\na consideration of the character of the roots of the quartic equation resulting from the\nelimination of y between (58) and (56) with xn replaced by x\n\u2212\nn + \u03b4. It is not attempted here.\nHowever, in terms of \u03b4, necessary and sufficient conditions to have y > h when x = 0 are\nx\u2212n + \u03b4 < xn < x\n+\nn , (59)\ntogether with v2n > 2gh. The left-hand inequality ensures that the ascending ball will not\ncontact either the face or the edge of the step. With little loss of precision when h\u226b a, (59)\ncan be replaced by the simpler sufficient condition\nx\u2212n + a < xn < x\n+\nn . (60)\nThe non-dimensionalised form of (59) is\nX\u2212n +\u2206 < Xn < X\n+\nn and V\n2\nn > 2H, (61)\nwhere\nX\u00b1n = \u2212Un\n{\nVn \u00b1\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212 2H\n}\n, \u2206 =\ng\u03b4\nv20\n.\nWhen the ball bounces from the higher step with xn < 0 and un > 0, in order to land on\nthe lower step the range corresponding to (60) is a\u2212 2unvn\/g < xn < 0, clearly independent\nof h. In all subsequent analysis it is assumed that conditions such as (61) are satisfied, that\nis, we reject situations in which the ball strikes either the face or the edge of the step.\n21\nThe horizontal displacement between bounces at the two different heights in the lower\nstep to higher step case also follows from (56) by setting x = xn+1 when y = h. Since un < 0,\nthe appropriate negative root of the quadratic equation for xn+1 \u2212 xn is\nxn+1 \u2212 xn =\nun\ng\n{\nvn +\n\u221a\nv2n \u2212 2gh\n}\n.\nIn non-dimensional coordinates, this becomes\nXn+1 \u2212Xn = Un(Vn +\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212 2H). (62)\nIt is easily verified that this result also applies for a bounce from the higher to the lower step\nwhen Xn < 0 and Un > 0 provided that H is replaced by \u2212H .\n8.2 Oscillating bounces at different heights\nIn Sections 4 and 5 we considered in detail the conditions required for direction and spin\nreversals of a ball. Since the equations governing the dynamics of U and \u2126 are the same\nwhen the bounces occur at different heights, all the results in these sections apply in this\ncase also. Thus, we now consider the case where U0\/\u21260 is chosen so that there are at least N\nreversals of direction of the ball. We choose the profile of the floor as in the previous section\nwith h > 0, and suppose that the motion starts with the ball leaving floor level in x > a, with\nlinear and angular velocity components u0, v0 and \u03c90, all of which are non-dimensionalised\nin the usual way on division by v0 or v0\/a as appropriate. We treat the initial projection\nsituation as the result of a zeroth bounce in x > a; thus even numbered bounces take place\non y = \u2212a and odd numbered bounces on y = h\u2212a. Denoting by xn the abscissa of the ball\ncentre at the nth bounce, we assume that x0 > a is chosen so that x2n\u22121 < 0 and x2n > a for\nat least N bounces.\nWith this scenario, the non-dimensionalised dynamics in the vertical direction is given\nby\nVn+1 = \u03b2\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212 2H (63)\nat even numbered bounces and by\nVn+1 = \u03b2\n\u221a\nV 2n + 2H, (64)\nat odd numbered bounces. Note that the sign of the 2H- term changes in this case since the\nodd numbered bounces involve the ball moving to a level H lower than the current bounce.\nEquations (63) and (64) can be combined into the single equation\nVn+1 = \u03b2\n\u221a\nV 2n \u2212 2(\u22121)\nnH,\nfor n = 0, 1, . . . , N . Squaring gives\nV 2n+1 = \u03b2\n2{V 2n \u2212 2(\u22121)\nnH}, n = 0, 1, . . . , N, (65)\na difference equation whose solution, subject to V0 = 1, is\nV 2n = \u03b2\n2n + 2(\u22121)n\u03b22H\n(\n1\u2212 (\u2212\u03b22)n\n1 + \u03b22\n)\n. (66)\n22\nAs noted in the previous section and from (63), for the ball to reach the higher level the\neven bounces must satisfy\nV 22n > 2H.\nSubstituting for V2n from (66) requires that\n\u03b24n + 2\u03b22H\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b24n\n1 + \u03b22\n)\n> 2H,\nthat is\nH <\n\u03b24n(1 + \u03b22)\n2(1 + \u03b24n+2)\n. (67)\nThe quantity on the right-hand side of (67) is the value ofH which ensures that the maximum\nheight reached on the 2nth bounce is precisely H . Converting back to the original coordinates\nand rearranging, (67) becomes\nv20 >\n2gh(1 + \u03b24n+2)\n\u03b24n(1 + \u03b22)\n,\nwhich provides a lower bound on the initial vertical velocity v0 to ensure that the 2n\nth bounce\ndoes give the ball sufficient height to reach the raised step.\n8.3 Bouncing down a staircase\nThe bouncing superball can have two types of motion, namely oscillating backwards and\nforwards or moving in the same direction at each bounce. In the previous section we treated\nthe case of oscillating motion with a single step. We now consider the case of bounces which\nall occur in the same direction and combine this with a full staircase to see what behaviour\nis possible for the ball bouncing down the stairs.\nAll the stairs in the staircase are of equal height h, which, in nondimensional coordinates,\ncorresponds to H = gh\/v20. Assuming that the ball bounces one stair lower at each bounce,\nthe dynamics in the vertical direction is described by (55) with H replaced by \u2212H and is\ntherefore given by\nVn+1 = \u03b2\n\u221a\nV 2n + 2H = f(Vn), say. (68)\nSquaring (68), the solution, subject to V0 = 1, is found as\nV 2n = \u03b2\n2n + 2H\u03b22\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b22n\n1\u2212 \u03b22\n)\n. (69)\nClearly,\nV \u2217 = lim\nn\u2192\u221e\nVn = \u03b2\n\u221a\n2H\n1\u2212 \u03b22\n, (70)\nwhere V \u2217 is the fixed point of the map (68). Further, it is stable since f \u2032(V \u2217) = \u03b22 < 1. It\nalso follows from (69) and (70) that\nV 2n+1 \u2212 V\n2\nn = \u03b2\n2n((V \u2217)2 \u2212 1).\nThus, for all n, Vn+1 < Vn if V\n\u2217 < 1 and Vn+1 > Vn if V\n\u2217 > 1. This implies that the height\nthe ball bounces from each stair as the vertical velocity approaches its limiting value of V \u2217\nwill be successively either higher or lower than the previous bounce, depending on whether\n23\nV \u2217 > 1(= V0) or V\n\u2217 < 1. In dimensional variables, the conditions V \u2217 > 1 and V \u2217 < 1 are\nequivalent to v0 < v\n\u2217 and v0 > v\n\u2217, where\nv\u2217 = \u03b2\n\u221a\n2gh\n1\u2212 \u03b22\n.\nWe know from (20) that the ratio Un\/\u2126n tends to the stable fixed point \u22121 as n\u2192 \u221e,\nprovided that U0\/\u21260 6= 2\/5. Since this is associated with the eigenmode with corresponding\neigenvalue \u03bb1 = 1, it follows that this fixed point also gives Un+1 = Un and \u2126n+1 = \u2126n. Thus,\nthe ball bouncing down the stairs will tend towards the combined stable state of V = V \u2217\nand U\/\u2126 = \u22121 as n\u2192\u221e and in this state, the bounce from each stair is identical.\nIn terms of the horizontal displacement between bounces, we replace H by \u2212H in (62)\nto give\nXn+1 \u2212Xn = Un(Vn +\n\u221a\nV 2n + 2H),\nwhere, as before, Xn is the dimensionless horizontal coordinate of the n\nth bounce. At the\nstable fixed point of the iteration, Vn = V\n\u2217, where V \u2217 is given by (70), and Un = U0 for all\nn. In this case, the horizontal distance travelled between bounces is constant, and is given\nby\nXn+1 \u2212Xn = U0(V\n\u2217 +\n\u221a\n(V \u2217)2 + 2H)\n= (1 + \u03b2)U0\n\u221a\n2H\n1\u2212 \u03b22\n.\nSuppose that the non-dimensional tread-width of each stair is W ; then the ball will bounce\nat the same point on each stair if U0 is chosen so that\nW = (1 + \u03b2)U0\n\u221a\n2H\n1\u2212 \u03b22\n,\nthat is\nU0 =\nW\n1 + \u03b2\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b22\n2H\n. (71)\n8.4 Examples\nWe again take the coefficients of restitution as \u03b2 = 0.9 and \u03b1 = 0.5. For oscillating motion\nup and down a step, we take U0 = 0.45 and \u21260 = 1, which results in four direction reversals\nand five spin reversals, and choose the height of the step to be H = 0.1. The corresponding\nmotion is then shown in Fig. 11.\nTo simulate the ball bouncing down the stairs, we select initial conditions with \u21260 = \u2212U0,\ncorresponding to the rolling eigenmode. We choose U0 according to (71) with the width of\neach stair as W = 1, giving U0 = 0.362738. We also choose the height of the stairs to be\nH = 0.2. With these values, we find from (70) that V \u2217 = 1.305857 and, since V0 < V\n\u2217,\nVn will monotonically increase towards this limiting value as n\u2192\u221e. The resulting motion\nis shown in Fig. 12. Note that the position of the bounce on each stair gradually moves\ntowards the riser, and will tend to a limiting value as the motion approaches its fixed-point\nvalues.\nMany other forms of motion are possible on a staircase. One such example is shown in\nFig. 13, where the initial conditions are U0 = 0.3 and \u21260 = 0.681818, giving U0\/\u21260 = 0.44\nwhich again corresponds to four direction reversals.\n24\nFigure 11: Oscillating motion of a ball up and down a step.
