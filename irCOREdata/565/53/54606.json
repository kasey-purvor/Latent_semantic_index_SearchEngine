Both the converters exhibit unity power factor, \nvery low total harmonic distortion at the utility supply interface, good controllability under soft \nswitching condition for a wide range of power, and high efficiencies, whilst still having simple \nstructures.

Comparisons between two converters have confirmed the excellent \nperformance of the proposed matrix converter. \nIntroduction \nRadio frequency (R.F.) induction heating requires a high frequency AC power supply, typically 100-\n200 kHz. However, the conventional AC-DC-AC converter topology makes use of large energy \nstorage components, and requires complicated control algorithms to provide a unity power factor \nsinusoidal input current [1], [2]. Other systems [3]-[6] usually assume that a DC power supply is \navailable, requiring power quality improvements for interfacing to the utility supply, as reviewed in \n[7], [8]. There have been attempts in improving the power factor and input current waveform of the \nAC-AC converter for induction heating, as reported in [9]-[11], where the voltage drop across the \nswitch at turn off may be much higher than the input voltage, which in turn, may limit the system to \nlow frequency applications due to the difficulty of making high-speed, high-voltage devices. In \naddition, frequency modulation used for power control may cause some EMC problems at high \noperating frequencies. The single-phase H-bridge converter developed in [11], however, has \nsuccessfully operated at unity power factor and with a nearly sinusoidal input current. Recently, an \nalternative for that single-phase H-bridge, in the form of a single-phase matrix converter, has been \nintroduced [12], claiming to have the same features as those of the H-bridge. \n \nThis paper compares the H-bridge converter and the single-phase matrix converter (Fig. 1), in order to \nverify the performance of the novel matrix converter. Both the converters use the method of pulse-\nwidth modulation to control the output power, however, a new switching control pattern is required for \nthe matrix converter, due to the absence of a DC link. The new switching algorithm and the operating \nprinciple of the matrix converter will therefore be explained in the following section, before \ncomparing the performance of the two converters. \n \nIn the next sections, comparisons in topology, input current harmonics, power factor, and \ncontrollability are presented, together with test data from prototype converters. Lastly, practical \nefficiencies of both the converters will be presented. \n  \nH-bridge converter induction heating system Matrix converter induction heating system \nFig. 1: High power factor single-phase converters for induction heating \nProposed matrix converter and principle of operation \nWith the help of a more detailed schematic and key operation waveforms, Fig. 2, the operation of the \nproposed single-phase matrix converter can now be described. Because the system operates closely to \nthe resonant frequency of the load, the load can be considered as a current sink, simplifying the \nexplanation of the operating principle. \n \n  \nSingle-phase matrix converter Operation waveforms \nFig. 2: Proposed single-phase matrix converter and its key operation waveforms \n \nThe AC input is fed to the converter through a small line filter, comprising of inductor Lf and capacitor \nCf. The converter is a 2x2 matrix converter, in which each bidirectional switch is implemented using \ntwo MOSFETs connected in common source configuration, utilising the built-in diode of the device. \nAcross each bidirectional switch is a commutating capacitor. Capacitors CAX and CBX have the same \nvalue and are associated with the load-commutated (LC) row. Similarly, CAY and CBY belong to the \npulse-width-modulation (PWM) row. The load is an LLC resonant circuit, where L1 is the series \ninductor for matching the parallel resonant tank, consisting of work-head inductance L2, reflected load \nresistance R2 and tank capacitor CT, with the high frequency voltage source. \n \nBecause of the presence of the series inductor L1, a simple explanation of the operating principle can \nbe made by assuming that the load acts as a sinusoidal current sink, and that the devices are ideal. \nStarting with the load current (output current of the matrix converter) crossing zero and entering its \npositive half-cycle, the converter will go through the following modes of operation in the positive half-\ncycle of the input voltage (VAB > 0), Fig. 3. The number in a circle on each schematic represents the \ncorresponding operating mode of the converter, and mode 1 is repeated after mode 10 for the sake of \nconvenience. \n \n575\u00b5H \nQ1 Q2\nQ3 Q4\nC1 C2\nC3 C4\n1\u00b5F \nVin \nLLC Tank Work-head\nSBYR\nSBYF\nSAYR\nSAYF\nSBXR\nSBXF\nSAXR\nSAXF  \nG\na\nte\n \nsi\ngn\nal\ns\nO\nu\ntp\nut\n \nvo\nlta\nge\n &\n \ncu\nrr\ne\nn\nt\nCurrent \nVoltage \nt0\n \nt1\n \nt2\n \nt3\n \nt4\n \nt5\n \nt6\n \nt7\n \nt8\n \nt9 \n  t 10   \nSAXF \nSAXR SBXR \nSBXF \nSAYF \nSAYR SBYR \nSBYF \nCAX CBX\nCAY CBY\nCf \nLf \nVs \nA \nB \nX \nY \nCT\nR2\nL2\nL1\n575\u00b5H\nCAX CAY \nCBX CBY \n1\u00b5FVin\nSAX\nSAY \nSBX SBY \nLLC Tank\nWork-head \nMode 1 [t0, t1]: Before this mode, t < t0, switches SAXR and SBYR are on, creating a path for the load \ncurrent in its negative half-cycle, and making zero voltage drop on CAX and CBY. The voltage on CAY \nand CBX will be the instantaneous input voltage VAB. At t = t0, both SAXR and SBYR are turned off, and \nswitches SAXF and SBYF are turned on under zero-current and zero-voltage condition. As the current is \nflowing in the diodes associated with devices, the output voltage equals the input voltage VAB. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 3: Operation modes of the proposed single-phase matrix converter \n \nMode 2 [t1, t2]: At some time through the switching cycle, SBYF is switched off, and its counterpart in \nthe opposite phase leg, SAYF, is turned on under zero-current condition, because the built-in diode of \nSAYR has been reversed-biased by the positive voltage drop on CAY. The load current will therefore \ncharge up CBY and discharge CAY, making the output voltage decrease to zero at t = t2. \n \nMode 3 [t2, t3]: When CAY is fully discharged, the built-in diode of SAYR is forward-biased, and the \nload current will circulate through SAXF and SAYF, making zero output voltage. This condition remains \nuntil the load current has almost reached zero, when SAXF is turned off at t = t3. \n \n110 \n987 \n654 \n321 \nMode 4 [t3, t4]: Similarly, SBXF will be turned on at zero current when SAXF is switched off, causing \nCAX to charge up and CBX to discharge. This will cause the output voltage to further decrease, giving a \nnegative output voltage. \n \nMode 5 [t4, t5]: At t = t4, when CBX is fully discharged, the built-in diode of SBXR is forward-biased, \nand the output current will circulate through SAYF and SBXF, making the output voltage clamped at  \n\u2013VAB. Just before the current reverses, SAYF and SBXF are switched off. \n \nMode 6 [t5, t6]: At the same time SAYF and SBXF are turned off, at t = t5, SAYR and SBXR are switched on \nunder zero-voltage and zero-current condition. The output voltage equals \u2013VAB and the current will \ncirculate through SAYR and SBXR, starting the negative half-cycle. \n \nMode 7 [t6, t7]: Part way through the cycle, SAYR is turned off and SBYR is switched on, at t = t6. The \nload current will then be carried by CAY and CBY, causing the output voltage to increase until it reaches \nzero, at which time the built-in diode of SBYF becomes forward-biased. \n \nMode 8 [t7, t8]: This mode is similar to mode 3, when the load current circulates through SBXR and \nSBYR, giving zero output voltage. This condition remains until the output current is almost zero, when \nSBXR switches off, at t = t8. \n \nMode 9 [t8, t9]: At the same time SBXR is turned off, SAXR will be switched on under zero-current \ncondition, causing CAX to discharge and CBX to charge up. This will cause the output voltage to further \nincrease, giving a positive output voltage. \n \nMode 10 [t9, t10]: At t = t9, when CAX is fully discharged, the built-in diode of SAXR is forward-biased, \nand the output current will circulate through SAXR and SBYR, making the output voltage clamp at VAB. \nJust before the current reverses, SAXR and SBYR are switched off, and SAXF and SBYF are turned on under \na zero-current and zero-voltage condition, starting a new output cycle. \n \nFor the negative half-cycle of input voltage, switches SAXF and SBXF, SAYF and SBYF, SAXR and SBXR, \nand SAYR and SBYR exchange their role, respectively. \n \nAs may be seen, in addition to zero-current switching on or zero-voltage zero-current switching on, all \nthe switches are switched off under zero-voltage condition, with the support of commutating \ncapacitors rapidly removing the current from the switches. \n \nIn line with conventional matrix converters, there are two basic commutation strategies, namely \n\u201cvoltage commutation\u201d, which requires the knowledge of the sign of input voltage, and \u201ccurrent \ncommutation\u201d, which needs the knowledge of the sign of output current [13], [14]. These strategies \ncan be made in four-steps or two-steps, requiring little dead time between the steps. The commutation \nstrategy used in the proposed converter falls in the category of voltage commutation, using the sign of \nthe input voltage to select an appropriate switching pattern. The commutation, however, does not need \nto ensure a path for the inductive load current, owing to the support of the commutating capacitors, \nand the single-step switching pattern is therefore proposed, as may be seen in Fig. 2. \n \nThe proposed voltage commutation strategy is very simple and can be implemented at no extra cost for \nadditional snubbing components. It is also possible to find an optimal switching angle for the LC row \nthat enables the power control over a wide range, under soft switching condition. The power is \ncontrolled by varying the switching angle of the PWM row with a fixed switching angle on the LC \nrow, instead of varying the switching frequency. This helps reduce the EMC problems associated with \nthe power control method of frequency modulation. \nTopology comparison \nAs the structure is concerned, the matrix converter has a similar but somewhat simpler structure than \nthat of the H-bridge, without the rectifier between the line filter and the utility power supply. A \nsummary of component counts is given in Table I. \nTable I: Component comparison among H-bridge converters and matrix converter \n Traditional \nH-bridge \nModified \nH-bridge [12] \nMatrix converter \nSwitches 4 + various number 4 8 \nDiodes 4 (built-in) + various number 4 (1 bridge) + \n4 (built-in) \n8 (built-in) \nInductors Various number 1 (small) 1 (small) \nCapacitors 4 (small) + various number 5 (small) 5 (small) \n \nIn the modified H-bridge an unsmoothed DC link is accepted with a small LC filter after the rectifier, \nallowing a practically unity power factor sinusoidal current to be drawn from the supply. In the matrix \nconverter, the rectifying action is done with a proper switching control pattern, which means the \nmatrix converter and the modified H-bridge should appear very similar to the utility supply, due to the \nsame line filter they utilise for interfacing to the supply. The traditional H-bridge, however, must use \nan active rectifier, which is also a switching system, in order to improve the power quality at the utility \nsupply interface. Considering only unidirectional active rectifiers, up to two switches, two diodes and \none inductor are required in addition to the bridge rectifier and the large DC-link LC filter network in \nsome boost converter arrangements [7]. Other topologies, such as buck, buck-boost, or multilevel \nconverters, can also be used [7], with up to two switches, two diodes and one capacitor are required as \nadditional components in certain variations of multilevel converter. The traditional H-bridge would \ntherefore require a more complicated algorithm for the two switching circuits within a complex \nstructure, when comparing to the matrix converter and the modified H-bridge. Furthermore, the \nadditional components would introduce some extra cost and power losses in the traditional H-bridge, \nhence lowering the efficiency of the system. \n \nThe modified H-bridge converter [12] features soft switching over a wide range of power control, \nwhich is done by varying the pulse width of one leg of the H-bridge, whilst fixing the pulse width of \nthe other leg. The matrix converter can maintain that soft switching feature, but with a novel switching \ncontrol pattern, as described in the previous section. \n \nIn steady-state intervals of an output cycle, namely power transferring, zero output voltage, and back \npower transferring (to the input capacitor), the matrix converter always needs two built-in diodes and \ntwo active switches carrying the current. On the other hand, the H-bridge only needs one built-in diode \nand one active switch to carry the current in the back power transferring phase, or two active switches \nin the zero output voltage phase. Therefore, the overall voltage loss in the H-bridge should be less than \nthat of the matrix converter, despite the voltage loss on two diodes in the rectifier and two active \nswitches in the power transferring phase. \n \nThe situation, however, can be improved for the matrix converter if devices with full reverse blocking \ncapability are used, in which the matrix converter would only need two switches to carry the current \nfor any steady-state interval. \nInput current harmonics and power factor comparison \nA water-cooled load, with a quality factor of 7 (the ratio between reactive power and active power of a \nloaded work-head), was used with both the converters, together with a power analyser (NORMA \nD6100), and a power supply (California Instruments 4500iL) for maintaining the same input voltage, \nwhen conducting the experiments. \n \n  \nH-bridge converter Matrix converter \nFig. 4: Total harmonic distortion of input current \n \n  \nFig. 5: Simulated (left) and experimental (right) input current of the matrix converter at the input \npower of 1 kW \n \n  \nH-bridge converter Matrix converter \nFig. 6: Power factor of the converters \n \n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.60 \n2 \n4 \n6 \n8 \n10 \nPWM pulse width (microsecond) \nTotal harmonic distortion (%) \n160 kHz \n190 kHz \n0 20 40-8 \n-4 \n0 \n4 \n8 \nTime (ms)\nInput \ncurrent \n(A) \n0 20 40 -8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\nTime (ms) \nInput\ncurrent\n(A) \n300 500 700 900 11000.98\n0.99\n1\n1.01\nInput power (watt) \nPower factor \n160 kHz\n190 kHz\n300 500 700 900 11000.98 \n0.99 \n1 \n1.01 \nInput power (watt) \nPower factor \n160 kHz \n190 kHz \n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.60\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nPWM pulse width (microsecond) \n190 kHz\n160 kHz \nTotal harmonic distortion (%) \nBoth the converters are introducing very low total harmonic distortion (THD) to the power supply, as \nmay be seen in Fig. 4. As long as the converters operate close to the resonant frequency (about 167 \nkHz) of the LLC tank, the maximum THD value of 4% for the matrix converter over the full range of \npower control can be achieved. The very low THD value suggests a practically sinusoidal input \ncurrent waveform, as showed in Fig. 5. \n \nAlso, both the converters have a very high (practically unity) power factor for a wide range of input \npower, as depicted in Fig. 6, especially when operating at frequencies close to the resonant frequency \nof the load. \nControllability comparison \nThe power controllability of both the converters can be seen from the graphs of input current against \nPWM pulse width in Fig. 7, with a slightly higher ratio between maximum and minimum power for \nthe matrix converter. The matrix converter also features high power transfer compared to the H-bridge \nconverter at the same frequency. \n \n  \nH-bridge converter Matrix converter \nFig. 7: Power control capability of the converters \n \nBy combining the power control range of different but very close frequencies, one can obtain a wide \nrange of power control. It should be noted that the power control range can be expanded for real loads, \nwhich have higher Q-factor than that of the water-cooled load, because the higher selectivity of the \nload can create faster power drop when moving away from the resonant frequency. \n \nAs may be seen in Fig. 7, the input power varies almost linearly with the PWM pulse width in both the \nconverters, which means a computationally effective model can be used for the controller to \nimplement modern control methods, such as predictive or observer-based control. \nEfficiency comparison \nIn Fig. 8, the efficiencies of the converters are presented, showing that the matrix converter has a high \nefficiency over the full power control range, although not as good as that of the H-bridge.  \n \nThere are two factors contributing to the lower efficiency of the matrix converter when comparing to \nthe H-bridge converter. The first factor is the higher voltage loss in the matrix converter, as described \npreviously, hence higher conduction losses in steady-state intervals. The second factor is the number \nof devices being turned on and off in one output cycle of the matrix converter is eight, which is as \ntwice as that of the H-bridge. Assuming that the same devices are to be used for both the converters, \nthe switching loss of the matrix converter should be two times higher than the switching loss of the H-\nbridge, for the same output current. \n \n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6\n300 \n500 \n700 \n900 \n1100 \nPWM pulse width (microsecond) \nInput power (watt) \nSimulation Experiment\n0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6\n300\n500\n700\n900\n1100\nPWM pulse width (microsecond) \nInput power (watt) \n160 kHz \n190 kHz \n \nFig. 8: Efficiencies of the converters \n \nAs mentioned in the topology comparison part, the use of the high-speed, full reverse blocking \nswitching devices can reduce the conduction loss in the matrix converter. Furthermore, the switching \nloss can also be decreased owing to the reduction of devices being turned on and off in one output \ncycle as in the H-bridge. The single-phase matrix converter can then become a strong contender to the \nH-bridge converter as a high efficiency induction heater. \nConclusion \nThis paper has compared the novel single-phase matrix converter and the more conventional H-bridge \nfor R.F. induction heating. The matrix converter has showed excellent performance in terms of power \nfactor and total harmonic distortion at the utility supply interface, and good controllability under soft \nswitching condition for a wide range of power, whilst still having a simple structure. Comparisons \nbetween the proposed matrix converter and the reference system have confirmed the performance of \nthe proposed system. The efficiency of the matrix converter is quite high, although not as high as the \nH-bridge converter. However, the matrix converter could achieve a higher efficiency if the high-speed, \nfull reverse blocking devices are used, should they become available.  \nReferences \n[1] Bayindir N.S., Kukrer O., Yakup M.: DSP-based PLL-controlled 50\u2013100 kHz 20 kW high-frequency \ninduction heating system for surface hardening and welding applications, IEE Proceedings - Electric Power \nApplications Vol 150 no 3, pp. 365-371 \n[2] Okuno A., Kawano H., Sun J., Kurokawa M., Kojina A., Nakaoka M.: Feasible development of soft-switched \nSIT inverter with load-adaptive frequency-tracking control scheme for induction heating, IEEE Transactions on \nIndustry Applications, Vol 34 no 4, pp. 713-718 \n[3] Kifune H., Hatanaka Y., Nakaoka M.: Cost effective phase shifted pulse modulation soft switching high \nfrequency inverter for induction heating applications, IEE Proceedings - Electric Power Applications Vol 151 no \n1, pp. 19-25 \n[4] Ogiwara H., Nakaoka M.: ZCS high frequency inverter using SIT for induction heating applications, IEE \nProceedings - Electric Power Applications Vol 150 no 2, pp. 185-192 \n[5] Mollov S.V., Theodoridis M., Forsyth A.J.: High frequency voltage-fed inverter with phase-shift control for \ninduction heating, IEE Proceedings - Electric Power Applications Vol 151 no 1, pp. 12-18 \n[6] Ogiwara H., Gamage L., Nakaoka M.: Quasiresonant soft switching PWM voltage-fed high frequency \ninverter using SIT for induction heating applications, IEE Proceedings - Electric Power Applications Vol 148 no \n5, pp. 385-392 \n[7] Singh B., Singh B.N., Chandra A., Al-Haddad K., Pandey A., Kothari D.P.: A review of single-phase \nimproved power quality AC-DC converters, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics Vol 50 no 5, pp. 962-\n981 \n[8] Singh B., Singh B.N., Chandra A., Al-Haddad K., Pandey A., Kothari D.P.: A review of three-phase \nimproved power quality AC-DC converters, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics Vol 51 no 3, pp. 641-\n660 \n400 600 800 1000\n86 \n88 \n90 \n92 \n94 \nOutput power (watt)\nEfficiency \n(%) \nH-bridge\nMatrix\n[9] Shenkman A., Axelrod B., Berkovich Y.: Single-switch AC-AC converter with high power factor and soft \ncommutation for induction heating applications, IEE Proceedings - Electric Power Applications Vol 148 no 6, \npp. 469-474 \n[10] Shenkman A., Axelrod B., Berkovich Y.: Improved modification of the single-switch AC-AC converter for \ninduction heating applications, IEE Proceedings - Electric Power Applications Vol 151 no 1, pp. 1-4 \n[11] Sewell H.I.: The design and analysis of a high power factor induction heating system, PhD Thesis, \nUniversity of Sheffield, 2002 \n[12] Nguyen-Quang N., Stone D.A., Bingham C.M., Foster M.P.: Single phase matrix converter for radio \nfrequency induction heating, SPEEDAM 2006, paper 2108 \n[13] Wheeler P.W., Rodriguez J., Clare J.C., Empringham L., Weinstein A.: Matrix Converters: A Technology \nReview, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics Vol 49 no 2, pp. 276-288 \n[14] Mahlein J., Igney J., Weigold J., Braun M., Simon O.: Matrix converter commutation strategies with and \nwithout explicit input voltage sign measurement.
