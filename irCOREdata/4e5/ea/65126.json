There are a number of reasons why this reassessment is needed: \nthe lectures are finally about to be published in English translation; careful \nphilological work in German has exposed how corrupted the standard text of \nthe lectures is; and philosophers are finally beginning to critically integrate an \nunderstanding of the Geography into their overall assessment of Kant\u2019s work. \nEnglish speaking geographers will therefore soon have access to the lectures \nin a way that they have not done before, but they need to be aware both of \nthe problems of the edition being translated and the work philosophers have \nundertaken on their situation in Kant\u2019s work and their impact. More broadly, \nthe reassessment requires us to reconsider the position Kant occupies in \ngeography as a discipline as a whole. The article examines the history of the \nlectures and their publication in some detail; discusses Kant\u2019s purpose in \ngiving them; and looks at the way in which he structured geographical \nknowledge and understood its relation to history and philosophy. In terms of \nthe broader focus particular attention is given to the topics of race and space. \nWhile these lectures are undoubtedly of largely historical interest, it is for \nprecisely that reason that an examination of them and Kant\u2019s thought more \ngenerally is of relevance today to the history of the discipline of geography. \n \n  \n2 \nIntroduction \n \nImmanuel Kant\u2019s lectures on Physische Geographie were first published over \ntwo hundred years ago. They were discussed by Richard Hartshorne in his \ncomprehensive study of the discipline of geography almost seventy years ago, \na survey that has formed the basis for most accounts of Kant\u2019s text since.1 \nThe most comprehensive study in English\u2014J.A. May\u2019s book\u2014is almost forty \nyears old.2 So why look again at Kant\u2019s views on geography? There are four \nmain reasons. \n \nThe first is that the lectures on geography are far more talked about than \nread. The first full English translation of Kant\u2019s Physical Geography is due to \nappear in the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant in the near \nfuture, in the volume on \u2018Natural Science\u2019.3 Although parts of the lectures \nhave been available in English since the late 1960s,4 this will undoubtedly \nmake these lectures far more widely available. What are these lectures about, \nand how might we assess their claims today? \n \nThe second is that even this version of the lectures needs to be treated with \ncaution. It is unfortunate that even after such a long wait the English \naudience is going to have to contend with a problematic edition. Alongside a \ncontextualisation of the lectures, they need a warning about their status. The \ncomplicated lineage of the lectures will be discussed below, but for the \nmoment it suffices to say that the text being translated is corrupted, and that \nit may well obscure parts of Kant\u2019s intent. What are these complications and \nhow might this mislead? \n \nThe other two reasons are perhaps the most important. Third, these lectures \nand related writings are now beginning to receive critical attention in English \nlanguage Kant scholarship. More detail is provided below, but the basic claim \nis that just as Kant\u2019s Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View has been \n  \n3 \nreconsidered over the past decade or so, the Geography deserves and is \nbeginning to receive similar work.  \n \nFourth, just as in recent years scholarship has begun to recognise the \ncomplexity of Kant\u2019s ideas of some key topics, notably race, so too does his \nview of space need to be rethought. All-too-often Kant is held up as an \ninstance of views that he did not actually hold or was explicitly critiquing. \nMoving from Kant\u2019s Geography to Kant\u2019s geography more generally, we need \nto consider his position in the tradition more carefully. \n \nBack in 1939, Hartshorne noted Erich Adickes\u2019s assessment of the lectures \nand agreed that \u2018for geography today\u2026 Kant\u2019s work is of little more than \nhistorical interest\u2019.5 This paper does not seek to suggest that reading Kant \ntoday will radicalize the discipline, and this is not an attempt to rehabilitate \nKant. Rather it suggests that reassessing Kant might be a useful moment in a \nbroader reconsideration of the history of geography, and certainly of the place \nof Kant within it. Thus this interpretation takes issue with the \u2018little more\u2019 \nelement of the Adickes\/Hartshorne assessment, suggesting that its historical \ninterest is precisely why we should look at it today. As Livingstone suggests, \n\u2018the history of geography is the history of a contested tradition\u2019.6 Given that \nthis is true of the history of ideas more generally, and philosophy especially, \ntheir point of collision in Kant is a significant marker. As philosophers begin \nthe work of integrating these materials into their overall assessment of Kant\u2019s \nwork, geographers too should reconsider his views in light of the history of \nthe discipline. Yet rather than do as Hartshorne himself suggests, and \nprivilege Kant\u2019s other writings over the Physical Geography, which he \nsuggests should be relegated to a \u2018historical footnote\u2019, this reading begins \nwith the lectures.7 What do these lectures, and following them Kant\u2019s writings \non issues of concern to geographers more generally, add to our \nunderstanding of Kant\u2019s geography today? \n \n  \n4 \nImmanuel Kant\u2019s Geography Lectures \n \nKant lectured on a variety of topics during his career at the University of \nK\u00f6nigsberg. These included both philosophical and non-philosophical topics. \nThe lecture courses were often well attended and gained a strong reputation. \nMany of these courses have come down to us from Kant\u2019s own manuscripts or \nfrom student transcripts. Today these lectures are part of his complete works, \nand are invaluable sources of knowledge concerning his work, its substance, \ncoherence and development. Standard philosophical subjects such logic, \nmetaphysics and ethics were part of his normal program, but Kant also gave \ncourses on anthropology and physical geography on a regular basis. Initially it \nwas geography alone, but from the mid 1770s geography was usually offered \nin the summer semester while anthropology was given in the winter. In total \ngeography was offered forty-nine times over a forty-year period from 1756-\n96\u2014more frequently than any of his other topics other than logic and \nmetaphysics.8  \n \nYet Kant never produced a book from these lectures. The course on \nanthropology was worked up into a book by Kant himself, entitled \nAnthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View.9 The initial print-run was for \nthe largest number of copies any book of his produced in his lifetime.10 In \nKant\u2019s words the Anthropology was \u2018the present [i.e. the final] manual for my \nanthropology course\u2019.11 It seems that had Kant more time, he would have \nproduced a volume of the geography lectures himself. But he remarked in \n1798 that a version of them was \u2018scarcely possible\u2019 at his own advanced age, \nfor the manuscript he used to lecture was one he believed only he could \nread.12 Shortly after this comment, the first volume of an edition by Gottfried \nVollmer was produced, apparently based on transcripts of lectures from 1778, \n1782 and 1793, but this was described by Kant as unauthorized and \nillegitimate, of which he did not recognize \u2018either the material or the format\u2019 \nas his.13 This is hardly surprising: much of the work is not Kant\u2019s and this is \nnot made clear in the edition itself; and there is certainly far more material \n  \n5 \nthan could ever have been given in a single semester. The semi-authorized \nversion which was then rushed out in 1802, two years before Kant\u2019s death, \nwas compiled by Friedrich Theodor Rink, utilizing lectures from 1759, with the \nintroduction from a mid 1770s course, and is much less extensive.14 Rink \nclaims that he has based this on three notebooks of Kant\u2019s, but he \nunquestionably means student transcripts.15 Adickes thinks the first part is \nfrom 1775, and demonstrates that the text is unreliable in that Rink added \nnotes, and altered or dropped passages of which he could not make sense.16 \nWerner Stark has noted that the first half (which he dates to 1774) is much \nmore closely edited, with additions and references, while the second half \nreproduces Kant\u2019s text almost verbatim, even allowing a gap in the text (the \nomission of India and East Asian islands in the survey) to remain.17 Rink \nalludes to some of the reasons for this uneven treatment in his introduction to \nthe lectures.18 His promised revised edition, putting good the problems, never \nactually appeared. Vollmer\u2019s edition came out in an eventual four volumes, in \nseven parts in total, and was completed in 1805. \n \nIt is the Rink edition that is today known as the Physische Geographie, later \nincorporated into the Akademie Ausgabe of Kants gesammelte Schriften [the \nAcademy Edition of Kant\u2019s Collected Writings].19 This is the one that \nHartshorne utilizes, and that almost all accounts in English refer to, either first \nor second hand. Yet the dates of the materials used should give us cause to \npause. Kant gave lectures on this topic from 1756 until 1796, and his \ncomment that only he could read the text in 1798 indicates that he never \nceased to revise it over that period. The text we have takes the introductory \nmaterials from a mid-period course (1774 or 1775) and bolts them onto the \nbody of very early lectures (1759). At the time of the early lectures, \nanthropology was not yet being offered as a separate course, and some of \nthe materials for that came from the geography lectures. By way of context, \nKant\u2019s mature philosophy is said to begin with the Critique of Pure Reason, \nfirst published in 1781.20 Nobody seeking to understand Kant\u2019s considered \nviews on morality, ontology, logic, physics, or, indeed, anthropology, would \n  \n6 \ncontent themselves with \u2018pre-critical\u2019 works.21 Yet that is what is usually done \nwith the lectures on geography. \n \nIn the early twentieth century Adickes attempted to get the Akademie \nAusgabe to produce a new version of the Geography, instead of relying on \nRink\u2019s, but this was declined due to feasibility: the volume was already \ntypeset. The forthcoming Volume XXVI of Akademie edition will include \nseveral transcriptions of the lectures, prepared by the historian of philosophy \nWerner Stark;22 and Volume XIV includes notes on geography, along with \nmathematics, physics and chemistry.23 Yet unfortunately the forthcoming \nEnglish translation is of the Rink edition. This is certainly better than nothing \nbut it is interesting again to contrast this with the Anthropology, which has \nbeen available in English for several years in a reliable edition, with \ntranslations in 1974 and 1978 and an entirely new recent translation by \nRobert Louden with extensive notes from Kant\u2019s manuscript and a long \nintroduction;24 along with forthcoming editions of variant lectures and note \nmaterials.25 \n \nThere are thus serious philological difficulties relating to reading the \ngeography lectures that go far beyond their inaccessibility in English. Stark \nhas done invaluable work in ordering and organizing these lectures, following \nhis work on the lectures on ethics and anthropology, setting them in their \nhistorical context and showing the variation across time.26 His transcriptions \nof the handwritten student transcripts are a major work in themselves. For \nmany purposes the most accessible edition of the lectures is the French, \nwhich although it is a translation of the Rink edition includes an extensive \nintroduction and a brief appendix of variants from other years.27 This is the \ntext used by David Harvey, whose reading is discussed below. \n \n  \n7 \nThe Neglect \n \nOf all of Kant\u2019s work, and of all his wide areas of interest, the neglect of \ngeography is perhaps the most glaring. It generally merits an entry in \ndictionaries of Kant\u2019s work, but these tend to be pretty brief.28 There is no \nexplicit discussion in the recent A Companion to Kant,29 and a recent edited \nbook on Kant and the Sciences makes only a tangential reference to \ngeography.30 Robert Hanna\u2019s comprehensive study, Kant, Science, and \nHuman Nature, makes only two passing references to geography and offers \nno sustained engagement.31 Many other accounts on related topics are \nsimilar.32 The same neglect can be found in works concentrating on Kant\u2019s \ntheories of space.33 And while the work on anthropology has been discussed \nby figures of the stature of Martin Heidegger and Michel Foucault,34 the \nGeography has not received anything like the same amount of attention. \n \nAside from the textual problems, one of the reasons is that philosophers have, \nby and large, not known what to make of the works. This is demonstrated in \ndebates about where the anthropology lectures might be placed in editions of \nKant\u2019s work. If it seems unquestionably the case that today the anthropology \nand geography belong together, this has not always been the view. Wilhelm \nDilthey and Erdmann argued that their relation was to the cosmology and \nphysical geography; while Emil Arnoldt and Adickes claimed that they were \nlinked to the metaphysics lectures and the section on empirical psychology.35 \nThis confusion might appear surprising, since Erdmann shows that parts of \nthe Anthropology derived from earlier lectures on geography, and Kant goes \nout of his way to demonstrate the linked nature of the inquiries.36 Yet there is \na certainly a link to the metaphysics lectures. Holly Wilson suggests the \nfollowing view: \n \nI distinguish between \u2018origin\u2019 and \u2018arise\u2019: the anthropology \nlectures arose out of the psychology lectures, but had their \norigin in the physical geography lectures. Kant\u2019s banning of \n  \n8 \npsychology from metaphysics initiated the movement toward an \nindependent series of lectures on anthropology, but the intent \nand content of the anthropology lectures finds its origin in the \nphysical geography lecture, which were initially given fifteen \nyears prior to the start of the anthropology lectures.37 \n \nThose that do discuss the work on geography do, sometimes, note its relation \nto wider concerns in Kant\u2019s work. Howard Caygill, for instance, in his Kant \nDictionary says that \u2018in addition to this explicit treatment of geography in his \nlectures, it is interesting to note Kant\u2019s reliance on geographical terms and \nmetaphors in his more strictly defined philosophical work\u2019.38 But this is as far \nas his link goes, perhaps understandable given the nature of his project, but \nshared much more generally. However, in recent years a number of people \nhave begun to analyse Kant\u2019s work on Anthropology in a new light, which \nnecessarily forces an encounter with the Geography. These would include \nRobert Louden\u2019s Kant\u2019s Impure Ethics, John Zammito\u2019s Kant, Herder, and the \nBirth of Anthropology,39 and Holly Wilson\u2019s Kant\u2019s Pragmatic Anthropology. In \naddition Cambridge University Press has recently published a useful book of \nessays on the anthropology,40 and there is an exceptional recent biography by \nManfred Kuehn which, together with Eckart F\u00f6rster and Peter Fenves\u2019s \npioneering work on the late Kant, enables a much more nuanced situation of \nthe geographical work.41 It is in the light of these researches, alongside those \nof Robert Bernasconi and David Harvey on race discussed below, that a \nreassessment can begin. \n \nKant\u2019s Pragmatic Purpose \n \nWhy did Kant lecture on geography? Although it became one of his most \nattended courses, this does not explain things sufficiently. Wilson is valuable \nin tracking the changing objectives for the geography lectures, suggesting \nthat initially they were \u2018purely scientific, that is, to make a more certain \nknowledge of believable travel accounts, and to make this into a legitimate \n  \n9 \nacademic course of study\u2019.42 But the popularity of the course meant that Kant \ncould begin to suggest that their aim could be \u2018to civilise young students to \nbecome \u2018citizens of the world\u2019\u2019.43 Zammito has similarly shown how the \nlectures are related to the Anthropology in providing knowledge, but stresses \nthis is for a philosophical purpose.44 As Louden notes, therefore, their aim was \nmore than merely scholastic, but rather: \n \nThe anthropology and physical geography lectures are thus not \nprimarily intended as further contributions to Kant\u2019s critical, \ntranscendental philosophy program\u2026 [which] was not his only \nconcern. A major portion of Kant\u2019s teaching activity was devoted \nto trying to enlighten his students more about the people and \nworld around them in order that they might live (pragmatically \nas well as morally) better lives.45 \n \nFor Louden, anthropology and geography are thus \u2018intersecting halves of a \nlarger whole\u2019.46 The problematic link between Kant\u2019s views on geography and \nanthropology, and, especially, on race and his cosmopolitan ethics will be \ndiscussed below, but the point here is somewhat different. This is that Kant \nsees these lectures as providing a broad knowledge of the world as a \nfoundation to the more general studies of his students, and that together the \nphysical geography and pragmatic anthropology give an empirical grounding \nfor his thought more generally. In a postscript to his 1775 article \u2018Von den \nverschiedenen Racen der Menschen [On the Different Races of Human \nBeings]\u2019 Kant suggested that the two lecture courses together were \nWeltkenntnis.47 This would usually translate as \u2018world-knowledge\u2019, but Wilson \nhas suggested the felicitous \u2018cosmopolitan knowledge\u2019, with \u2018cosmopolitan \nphilosophy\u2019 for the related Weltwissenschaften.48 This knowledge of the \nworld, for Kant, was integral to the moral and political life of the citizen. Both \ngeography and anthropology were taught by Kant because of their \u2018pragmatic\u2019 \ndimension, the way in which this knowledge can guide us in our moral and \npractical life.  \n  \n10 \n \nThis world-knowledge, this cosmology, is essential to his other writings. Kant \nsuggests that physical geography is about the world as an \u2018object of external \nsense\u2019; and anthropology as an \u2018object of inner sense\u2019.49 Indeed, in his essay \non \u2018The Conflict of the Faculties\u2019, Kant divides the philosophy faculty into two \nparts\u2014the one that deals with \u2018pure rational knowledge\u2019 and one that deals \nwith \u2018historical knowledge\u2019. The former contains metaphysics of nature and \nmorals, along with pure philosophy and mathematics; the latter includes \nhistory, geography, philology, the humanities and the empirical knowledge of \nthe natural sciences.50 Of these aspects, physical geography is \u2018the physical \ndescription of the earth\u2019, \u2018the first part of knowledge of the world\u2019.51 Wilson is \ntherefore clear that the lectures on anthropology must be seen as philosophy:  \n \nKant explicitly argues that the anthropology is a type of \ncosmopolitan philosophy. It is not a scholastic philosophy, and it \nis not critical philosophy, but it is a type of philosophy\u2026 \nThe twofold field of physical geography and anthropology are \nviewed cosmologically and pragmatically. In other words, Kant \nconsidered these two disciplines, in the way he taught them, to \nbe philosophy, and philosophy that was useful for the world.52 \n \nThese lectures were to serve as a propaedeutic for \u2018practical reason\u2019, and are \na \u2018history of the contemporary condition of the earth or geography, in the \nwidest sense\u2019.53 This, for Kant, is \u2018the preliminary exercise in the knowledge of \nthe world\u2019.54 Knowledge of the world is thus of both \u2018the human being and \nnature\u2019.55 Physical geography studies nature, anthropology the human, but \nthe latter outweighs the former, since \u2018nature exists for the sake of the \nhuman being. The human being is the end of nature\u2019.56 Nonetheless, the \ntwofold field of Weltkenntis needs to be treated cosmologically.57 \n \n  \n11 \nThe Context and the Structure of the Geography \n \nKant was an innovator in geography, if for no other reason that he was one of \nthe very first to lecture on it as an explicit topic, before it was common to \nhave chairs in geography in Germany. While others lectured on it in a way \nthat was more akin to travel writing, Kant attempted to systematise the \nsubject, synthesising insights from a range of different sources. Indeed, his \noutline for the course was unique, and he had to ask for special dispensation \nfrom the Minister of Education in order to give a course for which no textbook \ncould be found.58 The latter was of the opinion that \u2018the worst textbook is \ncertainly better than none, and professors may, if they possess so much \nwisdom, improve upon their authors to the extent that they can, but the \nreading from notes must simply be stopped. From this we nevertheless make \nexception of Professor Kant and his course on Physical Geography, for which \nno appropriate textbook is yet available\u2019. Kant\u2019s own manuscript was known \nas the Diktattext, prepared around 1759 but much amended and now lost. \nThe Holstein-Beck manuscript is believed to be the closest to Kant\u2019s \nDiktattext. After Kant retired his colleague K. L. P\u00f6rschke used the text of \nGeorge Henry Millar, The New and Universal System of Geography.59  \n \nThere is not the space here to outline how Kant\u2019s understandings of specific \ngeographical issues relate to knowledge at the time and to debates in a range \nof contexts since. This has been discussed at some length elsewhere.60 \nNonetheless Kant\u2019s structure of the subject is important in itself and it is \nworth focussing on this. Initially his treatment included what was later \nseparated out as the Anthropology. While \u2018geography\u2019 in the late 1700s meant \nsomething rather different to today, and crucially depended on where it was \nbeing taught or discussed,61 what is striking is that Kant is interested in \nestablishing subdivisions within the broad topic, many of which bear similarity \nto subdisciplines today, even if others are obsolete. Kant is thus trying to \nmove geography\u2014not always successfully\u2014beyond mere \u2018earth description\u2019.62 \nAnton Friedrich B\u00fcsching\u2019s Neue Erdbeschreibung (New Description of the \n  \n12 \nEarth) was, as Withers recounts, based on lectures given at G\u00f6ttingen in the \nphilosophy department, and published in eleven volumes between 1754-\n1792.63 Kant too depends greatly on these kind of empirical examples, but he \ntries to situate this within a broad structure of the subject. It is notable that \nthe structure of most of his geography courses is very similar, even as the \ncontent changes. Kant begins with an introduction which provides a general \nassessment of the subject and its relation to other topics; moves to a \ndiscussion of the mechanics of the earth and then breaks the substantive part \nof the analysis into three parts.  \n \nThe first substantial part of the text is the more accurately \u2018physical \ngeography\u2019. It looks at a range of physical processes concerning earth and \nwater: oceans; land and islands as examples of the earth and its terrain; \nearthquakes, volcanoes and electricity; springs and wells; rivers and water, \nwind currents; climate, the atmosphere and temperature; transformations of \nthe earth; and seafaring. The second part concerns the three realms of \nnature: fauna, flora, and minerals. Many of the aspects of this second part \nwould not fall within the remit of modern day geography, with the exception \nof biogeography. The final part of the book offers a regional geography of the \nworld, with descriptions of particular regions and places in Asia, Africa, \nEurope and America. But Kant\u2019s Physical Geography was also a moral and \npolitical account, and included human beings in it, usually just before the \nsection on animals, discussing racial differences. In addition there are a range \nof comments in the third part concerning their geographical differentiation. \nHumans are thus seen as part of physical geography, both because they are \none of the features of the Erdboden\u2014the earth\u2019s surface\u2014but also because \nthey a causal mechanism for change to the earth itself, because they build \ndams, drain swamps and fell forests, thus changing landscape and climate.64  \n \nAfter a decade of lecturing, announcing his courses for Winter Semester \n1765-66, Kant outlined how his vision had developed, and how the more \n  \n13 \nexplicitly physical geography could sometimes be underplayed. This is worth \nquoting at length:  \n \nSince then I have gradually expanded this scheme, and now I \npropose, by condensing that part of the subject which is \nconcerned with the physical features of the earth, to gain the \ntime necessary for extending my course of lectures to include \nthe other parts of the subject, which are of even greater utility. \nThis discipline will therefore be a physical, moral and political \ngeography. It will contain, first of all, a specification of the \nremarkable features of nature in three realms. The specification \nwill, however, be limited to those features, among the \ninnumerably many which could be chosen, which particularly \nsatisfy the general desire for knowledge, either because of their \nrarity or the effect which they can exercise on states by means \nof trade and industry. This part of the subject, which also \ncontains a treatment of the natural relationship which holds \nbetween all the lands and seas in the world, and the reason for \ntheir connection, is the essential foundation of all history. \nWithout this foundation, history is scarcely distinguishable from \nfairy-tales.  \n \nThis is a point worth underlining. As Kant claims in the geography lectures, \ngeography is the ground or foundation for history, as events necessarily take \nplace somewhere, in some context.65 This is not to assert a priority for \ngeography over history, but rather to insist on their relation together, a \ncomplementary analysis rather than a separation. Indeed, as Withers has \nnoted, it was a commonplace at the time to see geography as the left \u2018eye\u2019 of \nhistory, with chronology as the right.66 \n \nThe second part of the subject considers human beings, \nthroughout the world, from the point of view of the variety of \n  \n14 \ntheir natural properties and the differences in that feature of the \nhuman which is moral in character. The consideration of these \nthings is at once very important and also highly stimulating as \nwell. Unless these matters are considered, general judgments \nabout man would scarcely be possible. The comparison of \nhuman beings with each other, and the comparison of the \nhuman today with the moral state of the human in earlier times, \nfurnishes us with a comprehensive map of the human species. \nFinally, there will be a consideration of what can be regarded as \na product of the reciprocal interaction of the two previously \nmentioned forces, namely, the condition of the states and \nnations throughout the world. The subject will not be considered \nso much from the point of view of the way in which the \ncondition of states depends on accidental causes, such as the \ndeeds and fates of individuals, for example, the sequence of \ngovernments, conquests and intrigues between states. The \ncondition of states will rather be considered in relation to what \nis more constant and which contains the more remote ground of \nthose accidental causes, namely, the situation of their countries, \nthe nature of their products, customs, industry, trade and \npopulation.67 \n \nKant therefore sets out a range of distinctions\u2014the physical, moral and \npolitical geography is alluded to here, but the actual analysis is rather more \ncomplicated. By the mid 1770s he offers a range of possibilities: \n \n\uf0a7 Physical geography: the foundation or ground for other types of \ngeography as well as history\u2014a general study or outline of nature; \n\uf0a7 Mathematical geography: concerned with the measure of the shape, \nsize and motion of the earth, and its situation in the solar system; \n\uf0a7 Moral geography: the relation between moral codes and customs and \nregions, a kind of spatial differentiation; \n  \n15 \n\uf0a7 Political geography: the relation of political systems and political laws \nto physical features of geography, part of the reason why these are \nonly nominally universal; \n\uf0a7 Commercial [Handlungs] geography: concerned with the geographical \nelements of trade in surplus products; \n\uf0a7 Theological geography: concerned with theological attitudes and \nprinciples and their relation to physical features of the landscape; again \na form of spatial differentiation.68  \n \nKant\u2019s humans thus move from being detached from the world into closer to \nrelation with the earth, nature and other humans. As the material in the latter \npart developed this led to the parallel lectures on anthropology.69 What the \nlectures together provide is a grounding of empirical detail. Crucially though \nthey try to provide a geographical perspective on a range of social, cultural \nand physical phenomena. If geography is a study of the difference space \nmakes, Kant can certainly lay claim to being a geographer. Yet, on the other \nhand, Kant was writing at a time when there was the beginning of a \nnoticeable shift away from the compilation of information and reports from a \ndistance. In the early nineteenth century field-based science was in the \nascendance, with the importance of trained eye-witness accounts, following \npioneering studies of Alexander von Humboldt, Georges Cuvier, and \nsomewhat earlier, the scientists involved with Cook\u2019s voyages.70 \n \nThe Impure Physics and the Question of Race \n \nIn his lectures on Logic, Kant suggests that there are four fundamental \nquestions. \n \n1. \u2018What can I know?\u2019  \n2. \u2018What ought I to do?\u2019  \n3. \u2018What may I hope?\u2019  \n4. \u2018What is the human being?\u2019 \n  \n16 \n \nKant suggests that \u2018Metaphysics answers the first question, morals the \nsecond, religion the third, and anthropology the fourth. Fundamentally, \nhowever, we could reckon all of this to anthropology, because the first three \nquestions refer to the last one\u2019.71 Just as these other realms of thought rest \non the fundamental question, namely anthropology; so too do Kant\u2019s \nreflections on the material world rest on the understanding of geography. For \nKant, knowledge of the world is not pragmatic merely when it is \u2018extensive \nknowledge of things in the world, for example, animals, plants and minerals \nfrom various lands and climates\u2014but only when it contains knowledge of the \nhuman being as a citizen of the world\u2019.72 In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant \ndistinguishes between nature and freedom, to which accord the natural law \nand the moral law. The first accords to everything that is; the second to what \nshould be. He suggests that while both have separate systems, they can \ncome together in a single philosophical system\u2014his own critical philosophy. In \nthis critical philosophy there is a pure philosophy of pure reason; but also an \nempirical element, and this for both nature and freedom.73 In the Geography \nlectures Kant begins by distinguishing between pure rational knowledge and \nknowledge from experience, through our senses.74 In other words, pragmatic \nanthropology is the relation of the human to the world, and is thus what \nRobert Louden calls \u2018impure ethics\u2019.75 Although much of the material in the \ngeography lectures would also come under that remit\u2014recall the origin of the \nanthropology lectures\u2014we might make a case that much of the rest of the \ngeography is \u2018impure physics\u2019, in other words the empirical detail that inhabits \nthe categories of abstract thought. The use of this kind of detail is \npronounced, for example, in Kant\u2019s third critique, especially in the passages \non teleological judgment.76 And in addition, while in his Metaphysical \nFoundations of Natural Science Kant expresses the view that the empirical \nsciences require a pure grounding;77 his last work, the Opus Postumum, bears \nthe title of \u2018Transition from the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science \nto Physics\u2019.78 \n \n  \n17 \nThus while much of the detail of the Geography may be outdated and \ntherefore of merely historical interest, Kant\u2019s way of structuring geographical \nknowledge and its relation to his thought as a whole is of enduring \nimportance. This importance lies both in the way he understands geography \nas a counterbalance to history, and in terms of the organization of knowledge. \nAll perceived things are located in logical classifications such as those of \nLinnaeus; and in space and time. Logic deals with the first; physics with space \nand time, and of these, geography deals with space; history with time.79 Kant \nsays that our experience of the world is limited in time\u2014our limited lifespan\u2014\nand space\u2014even if we have travelled extensively. So we must rely on others, \nwho can provide us with either narrative (temporal, history) or description \n(spatial, geographical).80 Geography therefore allows us access to the \nordering and categorizing of the world. Indeed, Kant distinguishes geography \nas the description of the whole world from topography as the description of \nsingle places and chorography as that of regions.81 Wilson thus suggests that \nthe role is fundamentally different from a merely enumerative account of the \nworld as it is. As she suggests physical geography in Kant\u2019s terms \u2018is not \nmeant to be a description of the world as a scientist would view it, but rather \ngeography is to be viewed in its purposiveness\u2019.82 Thus for all their problems \nand their undoubted neglect, these lectures remain a key part of Kant\u2019s work, \nand in recent years there has been some important discussion. The remainder \nof this essay will first discuss race\u2014a theme treated at length in the various \nversions of the Geography; and then space, a topic which, while not \nextensively treated in the Geography, is key to any engagement with Kant\u2019s \ngeography in more general terms. \n \nThe question of Kant\u2019s racism has been discussed quite extensively in recent \nyears. More challenging than his rehearsal of racial stereotypes and \nentertaining of prejudices is his theorisation of race. What this means is that \nKant cannot simply be excused as a product of his time\u2014trading on \ncontemporary views about racial superiority and the like\u2014because he went \nout of his way to explicitly theorise race, as a crucial category of human life. \n  \n18 \nThe charges can be found in a series of essays by Robert Bernasconi.83 For \nBernasconi Kant plays a significant role because he can be seen as the thinker \nwho actually \u2018invented the scientific concept of race\u2019, as he was the thinker \nwho \u2018gave the first clear definition of it\u2019.84 Indeed, Bernasconi contends that in \ndoing so, he did not simply define race, but \u2018played a crucial role in \nestablishing the term \u2018race\u2019 as the currency within which discussions of human \nvariety would be conducted in the nineteenth century\u2019.85 Bernasconi\u2019s \nphrasing is telling: \u2018Kant opened up a new space for thinking: he took it into \nnew territory\u2019. While Kant may have stopped there, \u2018those who came after \nhim worked in the space he opened up\u2019.86 Some responses have contended \nthat this does not affect Kant\u2019s broader thought, and that Kant\u2019s arguments \nare stronger than his prejudices.87 But this is insufficient for Bernasconi. He \nsuggests that there is a different between analytic and Continental philosophy \nin terms of their treatment of the biography of thinkers. Analytic is defined as \n\u2018a form of thinking that leaves no room for synthesis, holism or dialectic\u2019.88 \nWhile the geographies and histories of this distinction are problematic, as he \nrecognizes, there is some profit in the divide for analysis. For Bernasconi the \nanalytical approach to philosophy, which tends to be ahistorical in its reading \nof canonical thinkers, means that: \n \nThe racism of a philosopher is easily put to one side. Kant\u2019s \nracism does not raise a question for his cosmopolitanism \nbecause cosmopolitanism can be defined in such a way as to \nexclude racism. Thus, the fact that Kant was a racist has no \nimplications for contemporary Kantians. However, things are \nsomewhat different for Continental philosophers.89 \n \nGiven that the fundamental philosophical influence in contemporary \ngeography is from the \u2018Continental\u2019 strand, this is of crucial importance. \n \nOne of the few geographers who has recognized the implications of this \nchallenge has been David Harvey. In a series of publications Harvey has \n  \n19 \nrelated the geography lectures to the contemporary interest in Kant\u2019s \ncosmopolitanism,90 suggesting, like Bernasconi, that the claims of the lectures \nrender this particular concept deeply problematic. Harvey notes that many \nKantians want to dismiss the work on geography as \u2018\u2018irrelevant\u2019, \u2018not to be \ntaken seriously\u2019\u2019 or [suggest that] it \u2018lacks interest'\u2018.91 In this position they are \nclose to the oft-quoted remark from Benno Erdmann, who described the \nAnthropology as the \u2018laborious compilation of a seventy-four year old man as \nhe stood on the threshold of decrepitude\u2019.92 For Harvey \u2018the content of Kant\u2019s \nGeography is nothing short of an intellectual and political embarrassment\u2019.93 \nBoth aspects of this assessment might be encapsulated by Kant\u2019s claim that \n\u2018humanity has its highest perfection in the white race\u2019, with \u2018yellow\u2019, \u2018Negro\u2019 \nand \u2018red\u2019 races at respectively lower rungs.94  \n \nIn his 1755 book Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens Kant \nhad displayed the same penchant for dubious scientific reasoning, uncritical \nadoption of other material and wild speculation that was to characterize his \ngeography lectures beginning the next year. In particular, Kant speculates on \nthe inhabitants of Mercury and Venus, suggesting that their bodily \nconstitution is such that they could not dwell on earth. In addition those \nplanets like earth and Mars are midway in the planetary system and therefore \ntheir inhabitants are balanced, whereas those of Mercury and Venus are \nstupid, weak, unable to submit to justice, and coarse in body.95 As David Clark \nsuggests, this \u2018functions as a barely displaced allegory of Europe\u2019s close \nencounters with Africa and other equatorial regions of the universe\u2019.96 This \ntext might be considered as an early work, unimportant and tangential to \nKant\u2019s mature philosophical edifice. The same cannot be said of the lectures \non geography, which extended until his retirement, and, from the available \ntranscripts never ceased to discuss race and racial ideas. \n \nHarvey is right to suggest that there is much material that is offensive, \nembarrassing and irrelevant in the lectures, and makes a compelling case for \nthe difficulties in accepting Kant\u2019s ethical views in their wake. These views \n  \n20 \ncannot be swept away, disassociated from the thought people want to \nsalvage. In Harvey\u2019s account, there is a direct linkage between the expression \nof these ideas and the philosophical architecture erected on top of the \nWeltkenntnis. Harvey is right that the responses of traditional Kantians are \ninadequate, but over recent years there has been the beginning of some \ninterest in these issues. While there are a number of Kantians who remain in \ndenial, both on race and Geography, there are others who have risen to a \nchallenge to think both in the context of his work as a whole. In part this has \nbeen a by-product of important studies of the Anthropology, but more \ngenerally there are now philosophers who have taken Kant\u2019s geography \nseriously, which is not to say uncritically.  \n \nLouden is a good example of this tendency. He stresses the teleological \naspects of Kant\u2019s theory of race, which implies that \u2018racial characteristics are \npresent in the human species because they help us reach our collective \ndestiny\u2019,97 that is they come out depending on climatic and landscape \nfeatures\u2014a form of geographical determinism. What this means is that Kant is \narguing for a theory of race as monogenetic rather than polygenetic, as \nproposed by contemporaries, such as Lord Kames in 1774. Kames suggested \nthat different races were different species, from different origins, whereas \nmonogenism is the belief that humans are all ultimately related, stemming \nfrom some common ancestor. While more traditional biblical accounts stress \nmonogenism\u2014based on the lineage through Adam\u2014accounts at the time \nbegan to stress the distinctions of the races. Kant thus believes in the \nultimate unity of the human species, rather than being like those racial \nthinkers who thought that different origins implied inequality.98 But this is not \nto defend Kant, as he did say some deeply unpleasant things about race, \nwhich in Louden\u2019s balanced judgment means that earlier views\u2014such as that \nof Ernst Cassirer that Kant was progressive, \u2018humanitarian\u2019 and \u2018equalitarian\u2019, \nand distinct from Gobineau\u2014need to be discarded.99 For Louden, \u2018not all of \nKant\u2019s ideas about race are entirely \u2018humanitarian\u2019 and \u2018equalitarian\u2019, and the \n  \n21 \ngap between Gobineau and Kant is unfortunately not always as wide as one \nwould like it to be\u2019.100 \n \nGiven the way that race is the link between the Anthropology and the \nGeography, its minimal role in the former is perhaps somewhat surprising.101 \nAs Wilson suggests, \u2018the anthropology begins where physical geography ends; \nthe different climates and environments, explored in physical geography, \nexplain the different kinds of human beings in the world, but the inner germs \nand natural predispositions, explored in anthropology, explain why the human \nbeing can adapt itself to the different climates and environments\u2019.102 Indeed, \nKant separated out from the Physical Geography course much of what he calls \n\u2018moral geography\u2019, that is that which concerns the \u2018customs and characters\u2019 of \ndifferent peoples.103 But in the published version of the Anthropology Kant \nsays little, and suggests that the observations on the relation of physiognomy \nto race \u2018belong more to physical geography than pragmatic anthropology\u2019.104 \nHe does say more in the Geography. This has led Louden to propose the \nintriguing possibility that the older Kant may have come to doubt some of his \nviews on race, which is why they are so brief in the Anthropology, which he \nedited, and more extensive in the Geography, based on older materials and \nnot edited until Kant was too old to proofread the manuscript.105 But as \nLouden notes, there is not the evidence to determine this, and those \nmaterials Kant did publish on race (from 1775, 1777, 1785 and 1788) tend to \nconfirm the worst.106 Suggesting that it was after the 1788 essay he changed \nhis mind is the last resort, with Kleingeld arguing that Kant changed his views \nin the 1790s, and probably after 1792.107 But we should note that the 1798 \nedition of the Anthropology makes reference to Christoph Girtanner\u2019s \u00dcber \ndas Kantische Prinzip f\u00fcr die Naturgeschichte, a work he saw as \u2018presented so \nbeautifully and thoroughly\u2026 (in accordance with my principles)\u2019.108 \n \nThus Kant\u2019s politics are rendered deeply suspect. For geographers this may \nappear relatively unimportant in itself\u2014Kant is hardly alone in the tradition for \nthis\u2014but the contemporary resonances are hard to escape. Yet while almost \n  \n22 \nanyone today would share his rejection of the lectures\u2019 reactionary attitudes, \nthis does not mean that the lectures are without value. Geographers have \nlong tried to separate the discipline and its questions from its imperial legacy \nand the answers from that time and space. Indeed, it is precisely because we \nneed to trace political ruptures that we need to think historically. \n \nSpace: Reassessing Kant\u2019s Geography \n \nIt is another rupture that may lead to the more important critique: that while \nwe think we know Kant\u2019s view of space, the account Kant offers of space in \nthe work on geography and, more importantly, elsewhere, is at odds with this \nreceived wisdom. Thus this final section moves beyond the Geography to \nbegin to reassess Kant\u2019s geography more generally. Kant\u2019s position within the \ndiscipline of geography is too often reduced to a caricature, again more often \ncited than read.  \n \nKant, it is generally supposed, held a view of space that was totalising, based \non Cartesian geometry, absolute in the Newtonian sense. Thus we find a \nrange of adjectival pairings common: Kantian space is Cartesian, Newtonian, \nand sometimes even more ahistorically Euclidean. Certainly in Kant\u2019s Critique \nof Pure Reason, in the section on the transcendental aesthetic, space and \ntime are pure intuitions, effectively hardwired into our brains, our very way of \nperceiving the world, rather than attributes of it. Space and time are thus the \nway that we experience, forms of sensibility, not experienced as such. The \nrelation of this to Descartes\u2019 and Newton\u2019s view of the material world is more \ncomplicated than a simple equation, but this is certainly not an open system. \n \nNonetheless Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason and his mature views on space \nwere explicitly directed at challenging a pure Newtonian conception of space. \nTo assert this does not mean that Kant\u2019s view of space is something that \ngeographers today would want to, or should, adopt. But they should surely \nknow better what they are arguing against. His earlier writings had been \n  \n23 \ncloser to a relational view, much influenced by Leibniz. But Kant\u2019s critical turn \nis not entirely against this perspective. As noted above, Kant\u2019s mature views \non space were first presented in his 1770 Inaugural Dissertation, and here he \nattempts to mediate between a Leibnizian relative view of space\u2014space is a \nproduct of the relations between things\u2014and a Newtonian absolute view\u2014\nspace is the container for things.109  \n \nBack in 1969, in Explanation in Geography,110 Harvey discussed Kant in a \nrather different register to his more recent work on the question of race and \ncosmopolitanism. Then, as now, Harvey is deeply suspect of Kant\u2019s absolute \nview of space. Harvey suggests that the absolute view of space needs to be \nunderstood, but alongside it we also need to view and understand space as \nrelative and relational. Even given the caveat above, Kant might seem to be a \nlong way from that position. But Harvey in Explanation in Geography offers \nwhat might be an intriguing possibility. This is when he suggests that Kant\u2019s \nview of space is one in which \u2018spatial magnitude is\u2026 only a measure of the \nintensity of acting forces exerted by the substance\u2019.111 Harvey then concludes \nhis analysis: \n \nSuch a view of space is contrary to the view on which Kant \nbased his philosophy of geography. Thus space is no longer \nsomething which can encompass our perceptions of the world. \nIt is, rather, a collection of measures determined by our \nperceptions. If space and matter can no longer be effectively \nseparated and if the properties of space can no longer be \nregarded as given a priori, the logical justification for the \nparticular view of geography adopted by Kant, Hettner, and \nHartshorne, can no longer be sustained.112 \n \nHarvey\u2019s source for the view of Kant on \u2018spatial magnitude\u2019 is Max Jammer\u2019s \nimportant study Concepts of Space. In the quotation from Jammer, the \nanalysis is of Kant\u2019s 1755 and 1756 writings. Jammer actually provides a \n  \n24 \nnuanced account of how Kant moved from a more Leibnizian view in those \nearlier works, to a more Newtonian view around 1769, under the influence of \nLeonhard Euler.113 In 1769 Kant tries to show that \u2018absolute space, \nindependent of the existence of all matter and as itself the ultimate \nfoundation of the compound character of matter, has a reality of its own\u2019.114 \nKant thus moved, on this account, from a relative view of space to an \nabsolute one. But he does not rest there. As Jammer convincingly claims, \nKant further worked on the view of space that he held, and by the Inaugural \nDissertation of 1770 he had reached a different view, attempting to reconcile \nthese positions. \n \nThe concepts of absolute space and absolute time are \nconsidered to be mere conceptual fictions, a mental scheme of \ncoexistence and sequence among sense particulars. Not itself \narising out of sensations, the concept of space is a pure \nintuition, neither objective nor real, but subjective and ideal.115 \n \nThis therefore forms the view of space that is well known in Kant, where \nthere are two pure intuitions\u2014space and time\u2014that structure all that we \nexperience about the world. In Jammer\u2019s words, space \u2018is not an object of \nperception, it is a mode of perceiving objects\u2019.116 \n \nBriefly, and necessarily crudely, a return to the Critique of Pure Reason is \nhelpful here. Kant suggests that space is an object of outer sense, and time of \ninner sense.117 Space then is as geography is, an element of the external \nworld alone, whereas time is both of the external and internal.118 Kant then \nposes the questions he aims to address: \n \nNow what are space and time? Are they actual entities? Are they \nonly determinations or relations of things, yet ones that would \npertain to them even if they were not intuited, or are they \nrelations that only attach to the form of intuition alone, and thus \n  \n25 \nto the subjective constitution of our mind, without which these \npredicates could not be ascribed to any thing at all.119 \n \nKant then suggests that space must be understood as a representation, thus \nleading him to talk of a representation of space. It is a priori, prior to \nexperience, and the necessary condition for it, \u2018the ground of all intuitions\u2026 \nthe condition of possibility of appearances, not as a determination dependent \non them\u2019.120 In a marginal note he added that \u2018space is not a concept, but an \nintuition\u2019.121 It is in this sense, and this sense alone, that time is \u2018something \nreal, namely the real form of inner intuition\u2019.122 In another note Kant adds a \ncrucial addition: \u2018So is space. This proves that here a reality (consequently \nalso individual intuition) is given, which yet always grounds the reality as a \nthing. Space and time do not belong to the reality of things, but only to our \nrepresentations\u2019.123 \n \nIn the first edition (1781) the point about magnitude is therefore the reverse \nof the earlier claim cited by Harvey from Jammer. Kant claims that \u2018space is \nrepresented as a given infinite magnitude. A general concept of space can \ndetermine nothing in respect to magnitude\u2019.124 In the second edition (1787) \nhe slightly alters the formulation: \u2018Space is represented as an infinite given \nmagnitude\u2026 Therefore the original representation of space is an a priori \nintuition, not a concept\u2019.125 This leads to the essentially important claim: \u2018we \ncan accordingly speak of space, extended beings, and so on, only from the \nhuman standpoint\u2019.126 A separate 1786 essay on orientation, that is literally, \nfinding the sunrise in the sky, Kant notes that \u2018even with all the objective data \nof the sky, I orient myself geographically only through a subjective ground of \ndifferentiation\u2019.127 Space and time are thus not absolute in anything like a \nNewtonian sense, nor does Cartesian geometry tell us about the world as it is. \nRather they are modes of access to the way the world appears to us. Kant \ntherefore concludes in a note to his own edition: \u2018space and time of course \nhave objective reality, but not for what pertains to things outside of their \n  \n26 \nrelation to a faculty of cognition, but rather only in relation to it, and thus to \nthe form of sensibility, hence solely as appearances\u2019.128 \n \nSeveral points emerge from this. One is that Kant\u2019s view of space (and time) \nundergoes some important developments, and that we need to be careful in \ntaking claims in, and about, certain periods, as indicative of his thought as a \nwhole. The second is that the Geography, given over several decades, is in \npart affected by these shifts. Preliminary investigations of the student \ntranscripts indicate this: the Holstein-Beck from 1758-59 contains no \ntheoretical discussion of space and time and their relation to geography and \nhistory; the courses from the mid 1770s have the more extensive introductory \ndiscussion drawn upon above (such as K\u00e4hler, which is the basis for the Rink \nedition introduction); whereas a course from the last years, such as the \nWolter transcript from 1796, underplays the theoretical material but assumes \nits essential insights. Third, and most important, that Kant\u2019s mature view\u2014the \none that emerges in 1770 and is the view of the Critique of Pure Reason, and  \narguably that of the majority of the geography lectures, is not an absolute \nview of space on the model of Descartes or Newton.129 The claim that Kant \nmakes is that space, as this \u2018conceptual fiction\u2019, offers a way of insight into \nhow we perceive the world, and is open to scientific examination, rather than \nthis determination being necessarily representative of space itself. In many \nplaces Kant recognises that directions in space are a product of our body\u2019s \nencounter with space rather than absolute and self-evident.  \n \nIn addition, as the work on space and time in the Geography indicates, Kant \nis trying to work the dimensions of space and time together. Kant surely does \nnot advance the kind of historical-geographical materialism advocated by the \nlikes of Harvey, or the \u2018spatial history\u2019 other geographers have suggested. But \nhis separation of space and time is a product of theorising, when in practice\u2014\neither in our experience or in the relation of geographical details to historical \nstudies\u2014they are continually intertwined. \n \n  \n27 \nConclusion \n \nGiven the renewed interest in the Anthropology and the links this material has \nto the Geography, and the forthcoming translation of these lectures in the \nvolume on Natural Science this seems an opportune moment to take stock of \ntheir historical importance and contemporary relevance. To read Kant\u2019s work \non geography is an inherently interdisciplinary venture, since they cover both \nhuman and physical geography and obviously relate to philosophical concerns. \nThe issues raised by these texts of Kant\u2019s are textual and linguistic, \nphilological and hermeneutic, philosophical and political, even as we consider \ntheir relation to geography and the wider history of ideas. Only a multi-\ndisciplinary, and multi-handed, approach can do justice to their complexity.130 \nFor geographers these lectures have some fundamental challenges to offer. \nMost of it is indeed, as Hartshorne, following Adickes, suggested, of historical \ninterest. This is the very reason why it is so interesting. If nothing else, this \naccount offered here is to show just how many difficulties there are around \nthe texts of Kant\u2019s geographies and their meanings. The link to the \nanthropology lectures and the question of race is a fundamental concern, \nprecisely because it is so deeply problematic, and because of the challenge \nBernasconi and Harvey have thrown down to geographers and others who \nwish to appeal to Kant\u2019s cosmopolitan instincts. More positively, and in part \ngoing beyond the Geography itself, there may be something of fundamental \ninterest in the thinking of the relation between space and time, geography \nand history. This is not to co-opt Kant into arguments for the primacy of \ngeography over history, nor for claims of their equal status in the study of \nsocial relations, but rather to recognise that the tradition of Western thought \nhas not always had the imbalance it is often assumed to have had.  \n \nThe argument made here could easily be extended to suggest that the other \nimportant geographical issues, such as the relation between the human and \nthe environment, and the link or distinction between the human and nature, \nmight also be profitably be rethought from the perspective of a closer \n  \n28 \nengagement with Kant\u2019s critical philosophy as a whole.131 It seems \nunquestionable, however, that a more nuanced understanding of these \nlectures and Kant\u2019s work more generally can only be a good thing for the \nhistory of the discipline of geography. \n \nReferences \n \nWorks available in English translation are generally referenced to the \nCambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant in Translation, which \nunfortunately does not have volume numbers.

Browne Garnett Jr., The Kantian Philosophy of Space, New York, \n1939, 11 (see 119) claims that Kant \u2018formulated the main tenets of his \nphilosophy of space\u2019 in 1769, a belief supported by A.

K. Schaefer, Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological \nExamination, Annals of the Association of American Geographers 43 \n(1953) 226-249, 233-4 makes a similar point, although based on the \nview that the introduction to the Geography dates from 1756. This is of \ncourse not to denigrate valuable work that takes the \u2018pre-critical\u2019 \nphilosophy as its object of study.
