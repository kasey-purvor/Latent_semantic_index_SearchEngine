INTRODUCTION\nHealth and Usage Monitoring Systems, (HUMS) range\nfrom single sensors that monitor use and condition of a utility\nto sub-systems that contain sensors, processors and algorithms\nto monitor system or structure integrity, reliability or condition.\nThe traditional applications of HUMS are on aircraft,\nespecially rotorcraft vehicles to improve safety and reduce\nmaintenance cost. One of the early studies of HUMS installed\non helicopters is associated with the UK North Sea helicopter\noperation [1]. In this study, 63 airworthiness related events\nwhich led to significant maintenance work were observed.\nOnboard HUMS successfully detected 69% of them.\nHUMS used in helicopters are reviewed in [2]. These\nsystems typically monitor vibration and measure the impact on\nrotor components. According to this survey, HUMS is already\nin wide use. Examples given include the Sikorsky SH-60B\nBlack Hawk[3], S-61 and S-76[4], the EH-I0l[5], the Boeing\nCH-47D Chinook[6], MH-47E[7], WAH-64 Apache[8], UH-\n60A Black Hawk[9], and AH-64D Apache[10].\nWhilst the efficacy of HUMS on life critical systems has\nbeen proven [11, 12], the application of the concept within\nsystems that require lower cost are less well developed.\nRecently R. Heine and D. Barker developed a HUMS solution\nwithin an army eight wheeled vehicle [13]. In this work, an\narray of sensors and simplified algorithm are used to identify\nthe terrain and its effect on mechanical components on the\nvehicle. examples of work on HUMS outside of the military\nand aerospace sectors can be found in [14-18].\nRegardless of their application or complexity, most HUMS\ndevices that have been realised to date require in-situ sensors to\nmeasure environmental parameters in real time. These sensors\nnormally need to be small enough to be integrated into a\nHUMS systems through ideally connectorless technologies and\nsupport low weight overhead and application within small,\ndifficult to access locations [19]. In applications such as\nconsumer electronics, the price of these sensors is a further\ncritical issue regarding uptake. Micro-Electro-Mechanical-\nSensors (MEMS) are emerging as a natural choice here due to\ntheir size, compatibility with monolithic and hybrid integration\ntechnologies and inherent robustness.\nEven with MEMS technology, guaranteeing the reliability\nof microsensors for HUMS applications is a challenging task,\nespecially when considering the operational environments. For\nexample, in military ground vehicle systems sensors frequently\nexperience dramatic temperature changes, moisture, dust,\nshock, etc. An example of the importance of the HUMS device\nreliability exceeding that of the systems is given in [1] where\nsystem failure was not detected due to the failure of a sensor\nwithin the HUMS architecture. To ensure the robustness of the\nsensors used in HUMS, they should have the following\nfeatures:\n\u2022 Online self-testable: validation of the raw\nmeasurement is essential as the HUMS concept relies\non the elimination of false positives and negatives.\n\u2022 Self-repairing. Most HUMS devices are designed to\nbe permanently assembled within the systems being\nmonitored which is often difficult to access. Failure\ncan invalidate insurance, compromise safety or\nnecessitate immediate and normally extensive repair\nwork. Some form of self-repair or at the minimum a\nbackup mode is needed for most critical applications.\nThe traditional solution to meet the above requirement is\nthrough the use of redundancy. At least three sensors are used\nto measure one parameter. If the outputs all match one another,\nthe measurement is reliable; if one of them does not match with\nthe others, a sensor failure is logged. However, useable reading\ncould still be provided by the remaining healthy sensors, and\nmaintenance could be suggested to prevent full system failure.\nThe problem of redundancy is it significantly increases the\nnumber of sensors to implement the task, which makes it\nimpossible for many applications. For example to equip HUMS\non helicopter engine and transmission systems alone needs 30-\n70 different sensors [20]. For wiring systems on aircraft it\ncould easily grow to several hundreds of electrical connectors\nto several different types of sensors [21]. Supplemental power,\ncommunication, processing capabilities requirements and\nsoaring weight, cost and complexity of the system simply\novershadow the benefit of installing HUMS.\nTo improve the reliability of the sensors used in HUMS, we\npropose a concept of multi-mode sensing combined with a re-\nconfigurable sensor network. In this paper we will demonstrate\nthe design and simulation of a MEMS based Dual-Mode\nhumidity\/pressure Sensor (DMS). A temperature measurement\ncan also be integrated. Compared to a traditional redundancy\nsolution the advantages include but not limited to:\n978-1-4244-4758-9\/10\/$26.00 \u00a9 2010 IEEE MU3065 2010 Prognostics & System Health Management Conference\n(PHM2010 Macau)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

(b) Top view of the DMS.\nPiezoresistors Rxl and Ry21 are parallel to the mem brane edges;\nRX2 and Ry2 are perpendicular to the edges.\nThe polymer coating is strip-shaped to give a different\ncoverage ratio on the x and y axes. The coverage ratio (r) is\ndefined by r = wp \/ Wm ' where wp is the width of the polymer\nand W m is the width of the membrane. Sensitivities of the\noutput to either pressure or RH are related to the coverage\nratio. The output voltage can also be described as:\nVx = a pxp + acpxqJ\nVy = a pyP + arpyqJ (2)\nWhere p is the pressure, tp is the RH (%), a p and a qJ are\nthe sensitivity to pressure and humidity. As the coverage ratio\nof the x and y axes r, and ry are not equal, we\nhave apx \/ apy :f::. arpx \/aqJy , hence equation (2) is solvable.\nWhich means with two output channels Vx and Vy , we can\nmeasure the pressure and the RH concurrently:\n( RYI R\nf JV =Va ---\nY RY1+ RY2 2Rf\nWhere Vo is the supply voltage and Rf is the reference\nresistors.\na) a reduction in the number of sensors and system\ncomplexity as a DMS can measure several physical\nparameters concurrently, and\nb) a simplification of the system integration architecture,\nespecially self-test as only one test stimuli is required\nto cover multiple sensing modes.\nII DESIGN AND MODELLING OF THE DMS\nRelative humidity (RH) and pressure have been selected as\nthe initial physical measurements that would benefit from\nbeing integrated due to (a) they are both common and\nimportant environmental parameters which often need to be\nmeasured together, and (b) both sensors require similar\npackaging, as the sensing elements have to be exposed to the\nenvironment. To integrate these two features we need to exploit\nstructures that have a measureable electrical or physical\nresponse to both parameters. In the case of pressure, a common\nMEMS architecture involves a diaphragm and a sealed cavity.\nThere are two methods to measure the movement\/deformation\nof the diaphragm caused by the pressure difference: capacitive\nor resistive. The former one uses electrodes deposited on the\ndiaphragm, and the later uses piezoresistive (PZR) integrated\ninto the diaphragm. Again most widely used RH sensors are\nthe capacitive\/resistive and PZR devices. The\ncapacitive\/resistive type normally contains an active layer as\nthe sensing element. The electrical behaviour of this active\nlayer changes due to the physical\/chemical reaction between\nthe layer and water vapour. The change, either in capacitance\nor resistance, is then measured by embedded electrodes.\nTypical materials used for the active layer are porous ceramics,\npolyelectrolytes and metal oxide [22-27]. For the PZR devices,\nthe sensing element is usually a composite structure utilising\npolymer deposited on silicon (e.g. beam or membrane). When\nthe polymer layer absorbs moisture, it expands and the swelling\ndeforms the composite structure. The deformation is measured\nby PZR embedded in the silicon layer. Examples of this type of\nRH sensor can be found in [28-31]. Commercialized products\nbased on PZR techniques include the HMX2000 series\ndeveloped by Hygrometrix [32].\nFor our initial design of a DMS, we used a composite\nmembrane structure with embedded PZR. Compared to the\ncapacitive\/resistive type, the electrodes of the PZR are not in\ndirect contact with the active layer, thus increases the stability.\nThe layout of the DMS is given by Fig. 1. In the case of\npressure, a square shape membrane is used that generates a\nreading relative to a sealed cavity. A polymer layer is deposited\non the membrane to measure the RH. The DMS has two\nindividual output channels: the x axis output Vx and the y axis\noutput Vy \u2022 Each channel consists of two piezoresistors placed\non the opposite edge of the membrane, parallel and\nperpendicular to the edge. These two piezoresistors are then\nconnected to a half-Wheatstone bridge (Fig. 2) to give the\nchannel output:\n978-1-4244-4758-9\/10\/$26.00 \u00a9 2010 IEEE MU3065 2010 Prognostics & System Health Management Conference\n(PHM20 10 Macau)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

When only perpendicular\npressure is applied, the stress it induces on the x and y axes are\nuniform. However, when humidity is applied, expansion of the\npolymer mainly induces tensile stress to the membrane, which\nis related to the polymer coverage ratio. Because of the\ndifferent coverage ratio on the x and y axes (0.4 and 0.8), and\nthe 'buffer zone' between the polymer strips, the humidity\nproduces more stress where the y channel PZR is located than\nthe x channel. Although the sensitivities to pressure of these\ntwo channels are also affected by the different coverage ratio,\ndue to the relative small value of Young's Modulus of the\npolymer, the difference is much smaller. Fig. 4 shows the\nmises stress distribution on the membrane and the voltage\noutput when (a) p=0.2MPa, <p=0%, and (b) p=OMPa, <p=IOO%.\nSimulations were carried out with pressure increases from 0\nto 0.2MPa with a step ofO.OIMPa, and humidity changes from\noto 100%, with a step of 5%. The sensitivity map of x and y\nchannel outputs are given by Fig. 5. From Fig. 4(b) and Fig.\n4(d), by using end-point linear fit, parameters in Equation 2 are\nfound as: apx=6.683, aq;x=-I.4745, apy=6.66, aq;y=-2.8274. Using\nthese parameters in equation 3, the measured pressure Pm and\nRH qJm can be obtained. The accuracy of this fitting can be\nexamined by comparing Pm and qJm with the actual applied\nvalue in the simulation (Pa and qJa). The fitting error e as a\npercentage is defined by:\nTable 1, material properties and parts dimensions\nIII SIMULATION OF THE DMS\nSwelling of the polymer due to absorption of water vapour\nhas a similar effect to thermal expansion. Thus we used the\nthermal-mechanical solver of CoventorWare to simulate the\nhumidity induced expansion. The residual stress in both the\nsilicon and polymer are dependent on the fabrication process\nwhich for this study are set to zero to avoid uncertainty. In\nproduction the residual stress due to curing of the polymer\nlayer will lead to an offset in the output voltage. This offset is\nusually calibrated by experiments and compensated within the\nDC supply chain.\nAs expected the pressure and the humidity cause different\nmodes of deformation to the membrane.

This could be\nachieved by the deposition of a thermal resistor on the\nsubstrate. A look-up table for temperature compensation can\nthen be generated by sensor calibration. Similar work has been\ncarried out on commercialized product [32].\nPerforming online built-in-self-test (BIST) of the DMS is\nmuch easier than with separate sensors, as only one main\nstructure needs to be tested, although small modifications of\nthe design might be required. The Bias-Superposition method\nis proposed to realise the real time test function [33]. There are\ntwo possible solutions: using thermal expansion or using an\n978-1-4244-4758-9\/10\/$26.00 e 2010 IEEE MU3065 2010 Prognostics & System Health Management Conference\n(PHM2010 Macau)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The former requires additional heaters to be\nbuilt in the membrane (Fig. 6(a)) to create thermal expansion of\nthe membrane. The later requires an additional test electrode on\nthe inside bottom of the sealed cavity (Fig. 6(b). A test voltage\nis then applied to this electrode, which will pull down the\nmembrane. For both methods a small controlled deformation is\nsuperposed onto the membrane, together with the effect caused\nby RH and pressure. The test output is then separated from the\nmeasurement by a filter, and compared to the calibration\ncoefficients (Fig. 6(c)). Applied test input could be close to or\nbelow noise level by using pseudo-random coding and cross-\ncorrelation[34].\nPZR Polymer Membrare\nHeater for BIST\nSealed cavity\n'\\\nSubstrate\nPZR Polymer Membrane\nt......J...J...\nSealed cavity\nElectrode for BIST\n+:::::\n'\\\nSubstrate\n(a)\n(b)\nfunction. The Confidence of Measurement (CoM) will\nthen be passed to the internal data bus along with the\nmeasurements.\n\u2022 If all the DMS's in the network are healthy, the data\nfusion algorithms average the output from each sensor\nto generate the final measurement of the\nenvironmental parameter being monitored.

Here the data fusion function utilizes the CoM\ncoefficient to compute an output with the highest\naccuracy possible together with a global confidence\nmetric.

The deformation generated is\nmonitored by the PZR, together with normal measurement of the\npressure and the RH. A filter is then used to separate the test\noutput from the measurement.\nBased on the DMS we propose a Re-configurable Sensor\nNetwork (RCSN), that can be switched between Normal\nOperation and a Backup Modes. Fig. 7 shows an example of\nthe structure of the network. A Local Data Processing Unit\n(LDPU) is used to collect and analyse the raw outputs from all\nthe DMS in a RCSN node. The Following algorithm in the data\nprocessing unit will be implemented:\n\u2022 Data pre-processing and sensor diagnosis: The\nmeasurement of RH, pressure and temperature will be\nproduced from the raw sensor output.

And in the extreme\ncase where all sensors partially fail, RCSN would still be able\nto provide a courses reference measurement.\nV CONCLUSION\nIn this paper we have designed a dual mode\nhumidity\/pressure sensor with the potential to integrate a\ntemperature function. Unlike other multi-function systems, the\nDMS is capable of measuring all physical parameters by a\nsingle physical device in the network. The [mal readout is\ngenerated by a post processing algorithm from the raw sensor\ndata. The benefits include: reduced sensor size\/cost due to\npackaging; simplified sensor structure, reduced external\ninterconnect, improved reliability and yield and compatibility\nwith BIST as only one test stimuli per device needs to be\napplied. We also proposed a re-configurable sensor network\nbased on the multi function sensor, to exploit their advantages.\nThe RCSN is particular useful for safety critical applications\nsuch as health and usage monitoring of large scale systems.\nThe concept of multi-mode sensing and RCSN can be extended\nto many different types of MEMS devices due to their\nsimilarity in structure and fabrication process.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the UK IeMRC, through\nthe I-Health project and Ultra Electronics, through the\nAerospace Wiring Test project for funding this work.\nReferences\n[1] 1.
