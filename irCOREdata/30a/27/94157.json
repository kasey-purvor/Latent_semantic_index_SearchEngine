INTRODUCTION \nThe Hwnan Development Index (HDI) devised by the United Nations has already \nbecome established as an important contribution to the measurement of living \nstandards. Modifications were made to the original methodology in United Nations \n(1994) to allow comparisons of performance over time and data were provided for a \nlarge sample of countries covering benchmark years from 1960 to 1992. \nData exist which can provide estimates of HDI for a substantial nwnber of countries \nin 1950 and for smaller groups in 1870 and 1913 . TItis may be of interest for several \nreasons . First, because economic historians ' traditional focus on national accounts data \nin assessing economic performance needs to be complemented by additional \ninformation if more comprehensive measures of the history of socio-economic \ndevelopment are to be provided. Second, since GDP\/head and the other components \nof HDJ (life expectancy and educational attainment) have generally advanced at \nvarying rates over time, this allows a new angle on comparisons of economic progress \nin different economic eras . TIUrd, it is useful to reflect on the possible implications \nof apparent discrepancies in the historical rankings of countries according to HDI and \nGDP per person. \nThis agenda is addressed here as follows . Section II briefl y describes and evaluates the \nconcept of HDI before data problems are considered and estimates are presented in \nSection Ill. Section IV discusses the fmdings . \nII. THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX \nHDI is seen by its authors as a contribution to the search for a better and more \ncomprehensive measure of socio-economic welfare than GDP. Its roots lie in an \napproach pioneered by Sen (1987) which sees underdevelopment as the lack of certain \nbasic capabilities rather than the lack of income per se. It is the lives that people lead \nwhich are taken to be of intrinsic importance and writers in this tradition stress that, \nin general , these outcomes depend substantially on the provision of public services \nsuch as education and health as well as the level of private incomes. If the correlation \nbetween income growth and enhancement of capabilities is weak, then there may be \na case for shifting development priorities towards the provision of public services even \nif this is at the expense of economic growth as conventionally measured (Anand and \nRavallion, 1993, p. 134) . \nHDI is a composite of three basic components: longevity , knowledge, and income. \nHuman development is seen as a process of expanding people's choices. Income is \nregarded as contributing to this end primarily in the escape from poverty; above a \nthreshold level it is considered to make a sharply diminishing contribution to human \ndevelopment, eventually tailing off to nothing . Longevity is measured by life \nexpectancy at birth and knowledge is measured by a weighted average of adult literacy \nand mean years of schooling. \nThe components are combined in a single index by measuring them in terms of the \npercentage of the distance travelled between an assumed minimum and maximum \nvalue in each case . The 1994 Human Development Report fixed these as the most \nextreme values observed or expected over a long period with a view to facilitating \nexplicit comparisons over time (United Nations , 1994, p . 92). \nHDI is (indexed life expectancy + indexed educational attainment + indexed adjusted \nincome)\/3 . In each case the indexed figure lies between 0 and 1. The procedure is \nprobably best understood by looking at a specific calculation. Accepting for the \nmoment the accuracy of the underlying data reported in Table 1, the estimate in Table \n4 for the United States in 1870 is constructed as follows . \nFor life expectancy the maximum and minimum are assumed to be 85 years and 25 \nyears respectively. The index for life expectancy is (44.0 - 25.0)\/(85 .0 - 25 .0) = \n0.317 . For educational attainment a weight of 2\/3 is given to the literacy rate - which \nis taken to have a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 100 per cent - and a weight of \n2 \n113 is given to years of schooling which are assumed to have a maximum of 15 years \nand a minimum of 0 years . Years of schooling for the USA in 1870 are estimated as \n4.8 years as explained below in Section III. The educational attainment index is \ntherefore [2(0.75) + (4.8 - 0.0)\/15]\/3 = (1.5 + 0.32)\/3 = 0.607. \nIncome is discounted increasingly heavily above a certain threshold such that the \nmaximwn (adjusted) value is taken to be 5385 1990 international dollars while the \nminimwn is specified as $200 . All the values in 1870 are below the discounting \nthreshold. The index of adjusted income is therefore (2457 - 200)\/(5385 - 200) \n0.435. Finally, HDI is computed as (0 .317 + 0.607 + 0.435)\/3 = 0.453 . \nThe widespread appeal of HDI lies in its emphasis on components of well-being other \nthan income. As its authors freely admit, there are , however, many possible objections \nto its use. An extended review of various criticisms is provided in a technical note in \nUnited Nations (1993) . Like GDP per person, HDI is simply an average measure, \nalthough, data permitting, it can be modified to consider inequalities or it can be \ncomputed for sub-groups of a country's population. \nIndex nwnber problems are a more serious worry. Clearly , the index has a very \nlimited coverage; that is , in effect it gives zero weight to aspects of well-being which \nmany would regard as important, some of which might easily be justified in terms of \nthe capabilities approach to development. For example, Dasgupta and Weale (1992) \npropose the inclusion of political and civil rights in a more comprehensive index of \nthe quality of life. It should also be noted that the selection of the maximum and \nminimum values in effect implies arbitrary trade-offs between components. For the \n1994 version of HDI used in this paper, a one unit increase in HDI would result from \nraising income by $15.56 or life expectancy by 0.18 years or literacy by 0.45 \npercentage points or schooling by 0.135 years . \n3 \nThese remarks - which, mutatis mutandis, would also apply to other diagnostics of the \ninadequacy of GDP as a measure of welfare such as heights - are intended to put HDl \nin perspective rather than to suggest that there is no value in its measurement. Given \nthe attention which the Human Development Report commands, it is appropriate both \nto make these qualifications but also to attempt some historical estimates. \nIll. ESTIMATES OF IIDI FOR 1870, 1913 AND 1950 \nIn order to construct estimates of HDI, data are required on real GDP\/person, life \nexpectancy, literacy and schooling. Both for reasons of data reliability and in terms \nof the comparisons developed in Section IV, the sample is restricted to today 's \nadvanced countries together with observations from Asia and Latin America where \nadequate information is available. \nFor historical estimates of real GDP, it has become usual among economists and \neconomic historians studying long-run economic growth to rely on the work of Angus \nMaddison. This paper is no exception and takes advantage of the recent update and \nrevisions in Maddison (1995) . \nFor life expectancy at birth in 1913 and 1950, evidence is generally available in the \nconventional United Nations sources listed in Tables 2 and 3. For 1913, it is necessary \nto supplement these for a few countries by independent estimates based on fitting life \ntables to available information on vital rates and age structures . For 1870, this \napproach has had to be adopted throughout and for Belgium and Switzerland estimates \nhave been interpolated from nearby years . The l870 estimates are clearly less reliable \nthan those of the other two years but are unlikely to be in serious error. \nThe greatest difficulties arise with respect to educational attainment, in particular \nschooling for which only scattered information exists prior to World War 1. With a \nview to historical comparability of estimates of HOI, it is , however, important to \ninclude schooling rather than rely simply on literacy as a measure of educational \n4 \nattainment since available evidence suggests that its indexed value is much lower. For \nexample, whereas the literacy estimate based on signatures in marriage registers in \nTable I for the UK in 1870 is 75 per cent, the average years of schooling of those \nborn in 1836-45 has been estimated as 4.7 years (Matthews et al ., 1982, p. 573). \nTaking account of this and using the formula discussed above, would imply an \neducational attainment index of 0 .604 rather than the 0 .75 value for literacy on its \nown. \nWhere data on schooling exist, they are generally for enrolment rates rather than for \nyears of completed schooling. Suitably lagged, these are used to generate estimates for \n1913 and 1950 in Tables 2 and 3. For 1870, there is insufficient information to use \nthis approach . Instead, schooling has been predicted from the evidence on literacy \nusing the regression relationship between literacy rates and schooling in the 1913 \ncross-section of countries . This regression is : \nSchooling = -1.375 + 0 .083 Literacy R2 \n(-1.580) (7.480) \n0.747 \nWhile literacy has been used to obtain both aspects of educational attainment, the \nformula for the index means that the value is not the same as would be obtained by \nusing literacy by itself as a proxy. \nEstimates of literacy are also somewhat tricky . Literacy is taken to include basic \nability in writing as well as reading for which ability to sign a name in a marriage \nregister is taken as a proxy. Data for 1950 are available in standard UNESCO sources \nbut are problematic for earlier years . For 19 I 3, the two main sources used are \nestimates by O' Rourke and Williamson (1996) for young adult immigrants to the \nUnited States in the 1890s and estimates from the United Nations for 1920. Where \nboth are available they are usually very similar; if the UN estimate gives higher \n5 \nilliteracy, it has been preferred. Where additional sources have been drawn on, \nattention has been paid to information on basic writing. \nTItis same consideration has dominated the compilation of data on literacy for 1870 \nwhere the sources are few , taking note especially of the tendency in Scandinavia to a \nmuch greater lag than elsewhere in Europe in the development of writing than reading \nability (Markussen, 1990) and to the general tendency offemale to be lower than male \nliteracy. While I believe that the educational attainment estimates for 1913 are \nreasonably reliable, those for 1870 are of rather low quality despite being the best \navailable and may well be subject to revision in the light of future research . \nTable 1.

DISCUSSION \nA first use of the estimates in Table 4 is to follow the lead of the United Nations \n(1994, p. 92) and to compare today 's levels of HDI in developing countries with that \nof earlier developers. The results are striking: in 1870 the HDI of Australia was equal \nto that of Bolivia in 1992, a country ranked 113th in the world, while Finland, Italy \nand Japan are all below the bottom country in 1992, Guinea, which scored 0.191 \n(United Nations , 1994, p. 94). Disappointments in development of the recent past like \nthe Philippines still emerge by 1992 with an HDI in excess of any country of 1870 and \neven India is comparable to France or Germany in 1870. A comparison based on real \nGDP per person is far less favourable to the today ' s developing countries: real \nGDP\/person in 1990 international dollars in 1992 is estimated by Maddison (1995, p. \n24, 218) for Bolivia(1990), India and Philippines to be $1744, $1348 and $2213 \nrespectively - well behind the leaders of 1870 in Table 1. \nIn the terminology of the United Nations a level of HDI below 0.5 are considered to \nhave a low level of human development, those between 0.5 and 0.8 a medium level \nand those above 0.8 a high level. On this basis, all but Australia were still at a low \nlevel of development in 1870 while nobody had quite arrived at a high level in 1913 . \nTwelve countries had reached a high level of development by 1950 (though not \nGermany or Japan) compared with 40 in 1992 (United Nations, 1994, p. 92). These \ninclude the Asian star successes - Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan -\nthree of which have an HDI higher than any country in 1950. \nThe decline in mortality in low income countries during the twentieth century is a \nmajor factor behind the relatively better showing of poor countries on HDI in the \n187011992 comparisons. Life expectancy at birth in 1990 averaged 56.8 years in \ncountries of low human development (United Nations, 1994) which exceeds any \nobservation in Table 1 and is broadly comparable with the leaders in 1913 in Table \n2. By contrast, the average of adult literacy in countries of low human development \n13 \nin 1990 was only 48 .3 per cent which is well below the median of Maddison' s sixteen \nin 1870. \nIt is indeed now generally recognized that improvements in monality since 1870 have \nlargely resulted from factors other than increases in income such as advances in \nscience and better provision of public health measures (Preston and Haines , 1991) \nwhich are available to poor as well as rich countries (Sen, 1995) . Regression analysis \nof the data in Tables I to 3 suggests an elasticity of life expectancy with respect to \nincome of at most 0.1 which would imply that only about a quarter of the decline in \nmortality between 1870 and 1950 in the Maddison 16 countries could be attributed to \nincome growth. \nA second comparison that can be drawn from Table 4 is of the speed of development \nin different eras. Here , the most interesting aspect is perhaps to look at progress in \nthe industrializing countries of the late nineteenth century and in the developing world \nsince 1950. For Maddison' s 16 the (unweighted) average gain in HDI between 1870 \nand 1913 was 0.236 points whereas for the sixteen countries with an HDI in 1950 less \nthan the 0.530 level of the leader, Australia , in 1870 the (unweighted) average gain \nin HDI between 1950 and 1992 was 0.387 points . The biggest gainer in the recent past \nhas been Taiwan whose HDI rose by 0.519 points between 1950 and 1992 a much \nlarger increase than the high between 1870 and 1913 of 0 .277 points posted by the \nUnited States . \nA third interesting feature of the estimates of HDI concerns disparities in the rankings \nof countries by HDI and by real GDP\/head . This is , of course, a comparison which \nis highlighted by the United Nations in its Human Development Report. In each year, \nthe rank correlations between HDI and real GDP\/Head are very high - 0.898 in 1870, \n0.924 in 1913, 0.915 in 1950 and 0.936 in 1992 - but there are always a few cases \nwhere significant discrepancies occur. There seem to be three possible and, by no \nmeans mutually exclusive, reasons . \n14 \nThe first and most obvious is measurement error particularly in the earlier years . \nAlthough my earlier discussion focused on possible errors in the estimates of HDI , it \nmay also be that the discrepancies indicate weaknesses in national accounts data . It \nmay be that further attention should be given to improving estimates both of HDI and \nGDP in these cases especially. \nThe second possibility is that at least some of the discrepancies are genuine and that \nthe HDI ranking is a leading indicator of subsequent changes in GDP\/head rankings . \nThis might be justified on the basis that the HDI ranking reflects relative prowess at \nhuman capital formation . The leading indicator hypothesis receives some support from \nthe data . Reflecting the increased sample size, a 'big' discrepancy might be regarded \nas a difference in rankings of plus\/minus 3 in 1870, plus\/minus 4 in 1913 and \nplus\/minus 6 in 1950 and the prediction would be that a country ranked higher (lower) \nwil l subsequently rise (fal l) in GDPlhead ranking by the next Maddison benchmark \nyear - 1913 , 1950 and 1992 respectively . This prediction turns out to be correct 13 \ntimes out of 17 . \nThe third explanation is that the discrepancies primarily reflect policy choices in terms \nof the priority given to enhancing capabilities through provision of public services. \nThere have been marked differences recently in the policy stances of developing \ncountries in terms of public health and education programmes which seem to be \nreflected in life expectancy and literacy outcomes (Sen, 1995). Similarly, changes in \npubl ic health and education policies appear to have been substantially responsible for \ndeclining mortality and partly responsible for rising school enrolment and literacy in \nlate nineteenth century Britain when HDI advanced strongly despite disappointing \neconomic growth (Szreter, 1988; Mitch, 1986). \nIf this third explanation turns out to be of central importance historically, this has \npolicy implications. As Anand and Ravallion point out (1993 , p. 144, 147), it would \nstrengthen the view that intervention and certain components of public expenditure \n15 \nmalter for human development over and above any role that they may have in \npromoting income growth. Further historical research into this suggestion seems \nhighly desirable. \n16 \nReferences \nAdeiman, I. and Morris , C. T . (1988), Comparative Patterns of Economic \nDevelopment 1850-1914.
