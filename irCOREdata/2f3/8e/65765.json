Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant\nneurodegenerative disorder of adult onset, associated with the expansion of a\n(CAG)n tract in the coding region of the causative gene, localized on 14q32.1.\nMachado-Joseph Disease shows non-Mendelian features typical of other\ntriplet repeat disorders, including clinical heterogeneity, variable age at onset\nand anticipation. Three phenotypes have been proposed (clinical types 1, 2\nand 3). Type 1 is associated with early age at onset and a high repeat number\nof the CAG sequence, and Types 2 and 3 have later onset and lower numbers\nof CAG repeats. This paper investigates whether there is selection against the\nMJD gene, acting through diVerential survival, nuptiality and fertility\nassociated with clinical type and age at onset. The study sample comprised\n40 MJD patients from the Azores (Portugal) having fully documented\nreproductive histories and known dates of death. The proportion of married\npatients of each clinical type increased from 0\u00b722 among Type 1 patients, to\n0\u00b740 in Type 2 and 0\u00b795 in Type 3. Age at onset and length of survival were\nalso associated with marital status, with the married cases having later mean\nage at onset and longer mean survival time. In the whole sample, clinical type\nwas associated with fertility, with significantly fewer children born to Type 1\npatients. Among married patients clinical type was not associated with age at\nmarriage, reproductive span or number of children. No reduction of fertility\nwas detected among married patients in whom the onset of MJD was below\nthe age of 50. The authors\u2019 interpretation of these results is that the\nhigh-repeat CAG haplotypes associated with early age at onset and clinical\nType 1 are selected against through reduced survival and fertility. The fertility\ncomponent of selection is mediated by nuptiality rather than marital fertility.\n361\nIntroduction\nMachado-Joseph Disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder,\nusually characterized by gait ataxia and limitation of eye movements, among a wide\nrange of clinical features, which all usually arise during adult life (OMIM 109150).\nCoutinho (1992) observed a mean age at onset of 40\u00b72 years in a large Portuguese\nsample, but ages of onset ranging from 6 to 70 years have been reported (Coutinho,\n1992; Sequeiros & Coutinho, 1993). There are a number of such disorders showing\nlate-onset neurodegeneration and dominant inheritance, the best known being\nHuntington\u2019s Disease. This combination of features is especially problematic for\nfamilies in which the disease occurs, since dominant inheritance implies that someone\nwith a parent carrying the gene has a 50% chance of inheriting it, and yet the late\nonset means that an individual will frequently not know whether they themselves\ncarry the gene until after they have married and reproduced. Molecular diagnosis\nbefore onset can remove this uncertainty, but brings its own problems (Meissen et al.,\n1991; Decruyenaere et al., 1996).\nFrom the earliest reports, MJD has been recognized as pleomorphic in its clinical\npresentation (Nakano, Dawson & Spence, 1972; Woods & Schaumburg, 1972;\nRosenberg et al., 1976). On the basis of clinical presentation and age at onset, three\nMJD phenotypes were proposed by Coutinho & Andrade (1978). Type 2 is the basic\npresentation, with progressive ataxia, pyramidal signs and ophthalmoplegia, having a\nmean age at onset of 40\u00b75 years in the large Portuguese series studied by Coutinho\n(1992). Type 1 is characterized by early onset (mean age 24\u00b73 years; Coutinho, 1992)\nwith marked pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. Type 3 has later onset (mean age\n46\u00b78 years; Coutinho, 1992), and is associated with additional distal muscular\natrophies and sensory loss.\nThe MJD locus has been assigned to the long arm of chromosome 14 (Takiyama\net al., 1993), and is associated with the expansion of a (CAG)n tract in the coding\nregion of the causative gene, localized on 14q32.1 (Kawaguchi et al., 1994). The\nexpansion of CAG repeats in coding regions is known to be a common feature of a\nnumber of neurodegenerative disorders (Tsuji, 1996). Such \u2018triplet repeat disorders\u2019\nshare a number of characteristic features whose inheritance cannot be explained by\nMendelian principles, including clinical heterogeneity, variable age at onset, and\nanticipation (earlier age at onset in successive generations).\nThe number of triplet repeats seems to influence aspects of clinical presentation,\nparticularly age at onset (Andrew et al., 1993; Snell et al., 1993; Koide et al., 1994;\nRanum et al., 1994). In MJD, a strong inverse correlation between the number of\ntriplet repeats and age at onset has been demonstrated (DeStefano et al., 1995; D\u00fcrr\net al., 1995; Maciel et al., 1995; Maruyama et al., 1995). Anticipation has been\nreported by several authors studying diVerent series of patients (Maciel et al., 1995;\nSousa et al., 1997), and is associated with an expansion of triplet repeats between\nparents and children, the diVerence in CAG repeat length being greater in paternal\nthan in maternal transmission. Type 1 MJD shows a larger degree of expansion in\nCAG repeats than the other clinical types. It has also been reported that a patient\nhomozygous for the expanded triplet repeat had juvenile onset and more severe\nsymptoms of the disease (Lang et al., 1994; St-George-Hyslop et al., 1994; Takiyama\net al., 1995).\n362 Lima et al.\nA survey of MJD in the nine islands of the Azores (total population 237,795)\nidentified 103 cases, which represents a prevalence of 1 in 2309 individuals, and in the\nAzorean island of Flores (population 4329) the disease has its highest worldwide\nprevalence (Lima et al., 1997b), with 1 in 103 people aVected. Even though MJD is\nnow considered to be one of the most common autosomal dominant spinocerebellar\ndegenerations (Takiyama et al., 1993; Kawaguchi et al., 1994; Tsuji, 1996), it is clearly\nover-represented in the Azores. As a comparative figure the nationwide survey of\nJapanese patients by Hirayama et al. (1994) can be cited, which estimated a frequency\nof about one MJD patient per million of population. The evolutionary processes\nresponsible for the high frequency of MJD in the Azores are most likely to be founder\neVect and genetic drift, as has previously been shown to be the case when high\nfrequencies of hereditary disorders occur in isolated populations (Morton, 1980;\nO\u2019Brien et al., 1988). However, a previous study has demonstrated that there is not\na unique set of founders for all Azorean MJD patients (Lima et al., 1998).\nThe main focus of this paper, however, is another evolutionary process, natural\nselection. Analysis of other expansion disorders, namely Huntington\u2019s Disease and\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (Frontali et al., 1996), has suggested that natural\nselection may act against the MJD gene through the diVerential fitness of CAG repeat\nlength in the causative genes. Under the model proposed by Frontali et al. (1996),\nmost of the alleles with the largest expansions are lost at each generation and are\nreplaced by those in the low\/medium expansion range. Such a mechanism of selective\nloss of the largest numbers of repeats would be expected to balance the inter-\ngenerational expansion of triplet repeats reported above. A case-control survey of\nMJD families undertaken to discover whether natural selection acted in the same way\nin MJD found no reduction in their reproductive output compared with unaVected\nfamilies (Lima et al., 1997a). That survey was limited, by the study design, to the\nfertility of married MJD patient controls, and could not consider whether MJD\npatients survived and married at the same rate as unaVected individuals.\nThe purpose of the present study is to take a series of clinically diagnosed MJD\npatients for whom complete reproductive histories have been recorded, and to test for\nassociations between the clinical features of the disease phenotype and survival,\nnuptiality and marital fertility. The variables subsumed in the clinical features include\nclinical type and two of its components: age at onset and length of survival. The\nhypothesis is that in a disease of this nature, of variable but generally late age at\nonset, and imposing no apparent physiological or biological limitation on reproduc-\ntion, reduction in fitness will usually be mediated by social behaviour. In cases of\nexceptionally early onset, however, it might occur that the suVerer died or became\nincapacitated before the normal age at marriage, thus obviating the behavioural\ncomponent of selection. Behavioural selection against the MJD gene may occur if\nsomeone who already has the disease, or someone who is an undiagnosed member of\nan MJD family, is unwilling or unable to marry. Additionally, selection may occur if\nthe disease develops in a patient who is married but still of reproductive age, and the\ncouple decide to curtail their reproduction at that point.\nSuch behavioural choices will be to an extent the prerogative of individuals and\ncouples, but will also be subject to societal norms of behaviour, through the reported\nstigma attaching to undiagnosed members of MJD families, as well as to those\nNatural selection at the MJD locus 363\nalready showing symptoms (Boutt\u00e9, 1987). The authors suggest that through these\nmechanisms the gene may influence the fitness of its carriers, and hence predict an\nassociation between the clinical features of MJD patients and their reproductive\nsuccess. They predict that clinical type, and age at onset in particular, will aVect\nsurvival, nuptiality and marital fertility.\nMethods\nThe series studied comprised 40 clinically confirmed MJD patients born in the\nAzores between 1901 and 1979, for whom dates of birth, marriage (if applicable) and\ndeath were available. The sample of patients analysed corresponded to all patients\nfor whom there was a complete set of data at the time of the study. Of the\n40 patients, 28 were married, and their complete reproductive history was fully\ndocumented. Cross-checking among the various genealogical sources, both oral and\nwritten, showed that, as far as could be ascertained, the unmarried patients had no\nchildren. This sample represented, at the time of the study, the largest group of\nindividuals for whom all pertinent data were available. For the married patients the\nfollowing demographic variables were calculated: age at marriage, number of\noVspring and duration of reproductive span (number of years between marriage and\nbirth of the last child). The information was obtained from an extensive demo-\ngraphic and genealogical database of the Azorean MJD families built at the\nUniversity of the Azores. The database and the software used for the analysis\n(ANALYPOP) were developed by E. Labelle under the supervision of F. M. Mayer\n(University of Quebec in Montreal) and have been described in detail in Lima et al.\n(1997b).\nThe diagnosis of MJD was determined by clinical examination by an experienced\nneurologist, using established diagnostic criteria (Lima & Coutinho, 1980). Age at\nonset, clinical type (assigned according to the classification proposed by Coutinho &\nAndrade (1978)) and survival time (number of years between age at onset and time\nof death) were the clinical variables describing the phenotypic heterogeneity of MJD.\nAfter testing for associations between demographic and clinical variables the\nconsistency of the present sample with the larger Portuguese series studied by\nCoutinho (1992) was established to give confidence in the wider applicability of the\nresults.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the sample divided by clinical type. Type 1\npatients had a mean age of onset of 23\u00b72 years, significantly younger than Type 2\n(t= \"2\u00b796, p=0\u00b701) and Type 3 (t= \"5\u00b789, p=0\u00b7000). Age at onset of Type 2 was 42\u00b71\nyears, and that of Type 3 was 50\u00b79 years, but the diVerence between them was not\nsignificant (t= \"1\u00b776, p=0\u00b7104). Among the whole sample, survival time was 12\u00b71\nyears in Type 1 patients, significantly shorter than that of Type 3, who survived for\nan average of 16\u00b77 years. The survival of Type 2 patients, at 13\u00b70 years, was not\nsignificantly diVerent from either Type 1 (t= \"0\u00b734, p=0\u00b7740) or Type 3 (t= \"1\u00b765,\n364 Lima et al.\nTable 1.

Among the married cases there were no significant diVerences in survival\ntime between the clinical types.\nThe proportion of married patients of each clinical type increased from 0\u00b722\namong Type 1 patients, to 0\u00b740 in Type 2 and 0\u00b795 in Type 3. This association of\nmarital status with clinical type was statistically significant (Kendall\u2019s \u00f4=\"0\u00b7615,\np=0\u00b7000). The association of marital status with clinical type means that some of the\ncomponents of clinical type, namely age at onset and length of survival, were also\nassociated with marital status, with the married cases having a later mean age at onset\n(46\u00b75 years versus 33\u00b71, t=2\u00b713, p=0\u00b705) and longer mean survival time (16\u00b70 years\nversus 11\u00b78, t=2\u00b761, p=0\u00b701).\nTable 1 shows that when the whole sample, both married and unmarried, was\nconsidered the mean number of children per patient was also related to clinical type,\nwith significantly fewer children born to Type 1 than to Type 3 (Mann\u2013Whitney\nU=43\u00b75, p=0\u00b7010). The diVerences in the number of children born to Type 2 and\nType 3 patients, and to Type 1 and Type 2 patients, were not statistically significant,\nwith U=97\u00b70 (p=0\u00b7499) and U=25\u00b75 (p=0\u00b7113) respectively.\nTo explore the relationship between age at onset, age at death and marital status,\nage at death for all cases is plotted against their age at onset of MJD in Fig. 1. The\nmean age at marriage was 24\u00b74 years. The sample included three cases of childhood\nonset, at ages 5, 6 and 8 years, who died at ages 13, 18 and 15 years respectively.\nThere were a further nine cases with onset below the age of 35 (these will be referred\nto as \u2018early-onset\u2019 cases), of whom five (56%) remained unmarried. There were 28\ncases with onset at 35 years of age or more (\u2018late-onset\u2019 cases), and of these four\n(14%) were unmarried. Leaving aside the three juvenile-onset cases, there was a\nsignificant association between early and late onset and marital status (\u00f72=6\u00b73,\nFig. 1. Machado-Joseph Disease profile by marital status.\n366 Lima et al.\np=0\u00b701). In order to illustrate further the importance of early onset in inhibiting\nmarriage, age at marriage is plotted against age at onset in Fig. 2. The trend line\nshows where the data points would fall if age at marriage were equal to age at onset.\nIn fact the mean age at onset (42\u00b75&15\u00b77) was much higher than mean age at\nmarriage (24\u00b74&4\u00b79) but there was some overlap between their distributions.\nNevertheless, all the data points lie below the trend line, indicating that there were no\ncases in which marriage occurred after onset.\nThere were 28 married patients, so testing for associations with clinical type within\nthis group was hampered by small sample sizes. The aim of the study was to discover\nwhether termination of reproduction at onset of MJD symptoms caused any\ndiVerence in marital fertility between the clinical types. Table 1 shows that there was\nno diVerence in age at marriage between the three clinical types. Type 3 patients,\nhowever, had a significantly later age at onset than Type 1 (t= \"2\u00b758, p=0\u00b7018) and\nType 2 (t= \"2\u00b787, p=0\u00b7008), while Type 1 and 2 did not diVer in age at onset\n(t= \"0\u00b778, p=0\u00b7789). There was thus on average a longer period between marriage\nand disease onset among Type 3 patients than among Types 1 and 2. However, no\nassociation between clinical type and length of survival or reproductive span of the\nmarried patients was detected. Nor was there any diVerence in the number of children\nborn to patients of each clinical type. For Type 1 versus Type 2 U=3\u00b75 (p=0\u00b7429), for\nType 1 versus Type 3 U=17\u00b70 (p=0\u00b7779), and for Type 2 versus Type 3 U=53\u00b70\n(p=0\u00b7700).\nIn order to explore further the question of whether marital fertility might have\nbeen curtailed by couples deciding not to have more children after the onset of MJD\nin one partner, the following additional test was devised. On the assumption that\nreproduction is naturally completed by the age of 50, the sample of married patients\nwas divided into two groups: those with onset below 50 years of age, and those with\nonset at 50 years or more. If onset of the disease after marriage led people to stop\nhaving children whilst still of reproductive age, a smaller mean family size in the\nFig. 2. Age at marriage in relation to age at onset of MJD.\nNatural selection at the MJD locus 367\n\u2018onset under 50\u2019 age group would be predicted. There was no such eVect either on\nreproductive span (t= \"0\u00b7679, p=0\u00b75052) or on family size, with an average of 3\u00b753\nchildren born to the \u2018onset under 50\u2019 group and 3\u00b777 to the \u2018onset at 50 and over\u2019\ngroup (Mann\u2013Whitney U=75\u00b70, p=0\u00b78242).\nComparison of the results presented here with data from Coutinho (1992) shows\nconsistency in the proportion of clinical types, with just over half the patients\npresenting with Type 3 MJD. Average age at onset in the present study was 42\u00b75 years\n(range 5 to 66 years), with a mean duration of 14\u00b77 years, slightly shorter than\nobserved by Coutinho (1992). This discrepancy can perhaps be explained by the\ninclusion in the present study of the childhood-onset cases with their short life span.\nIn the present sample, there is a marginally later age at onset of Types 2 and 3 than\nin Coutinho (1992): 42\u00b71 years versus 40\u00b75 years for Type 2 and 50\u00b79 years versus 46\u00b78\nyears for Type 3. This may be due to chance or might reflect slight diVerences in\ndiagnostic practice. Although the age at marriage of MJD patients in this study was\nin accordance with previously published data, the mean number of oVspring (3\u00b76) was\nlower than previously reported (Lima et al., 1997a). The earlier study had included\n96 unions involving an MJD patient, marriages that took place in the Azores between\n1850 and 1950, producing an average of 6\u00b73 children per couple. The authors believe\nthat the discrepancy in family size can be attributed to the later period of marriage\n(1921\u20131970) in the present study. Livi Bacci (1971) has recorded a decline in marital\nfertility in Portugal from the mid-nineteenth century, and Rocha (1991) has\ndocumented the twentieth century reduction in marital fertility in the Azores.\nAlthough the number of marriages per decade is very small, even within these data,\nthis decline is detectable, falling from 7\u00b75 children per marriage in the 1920s to 3\u00b77,\n3\u00b72 and 3\u00b76 in subsequent decades, and reaching an average of 2\u00b76 in the 1960s. The\ngeneral agreement between the results reported here and by Coutinho (1992) and\nLima et al. (1997b) suggests that the patients analysed in the present study are\nrepresentative of Portuguese cases in general.\nDiscussion\nThere are two mechanisms by which this selection occurred: firstly, and only\noccasionally, there were juvenile-onset cases who died before reproductive age, and\nsecondly, there were those who lived long enough to marry but failed to do so. Figure\n1 shows that for the juvenile-onset cases, the disease itself was an eVective barrier to\nsurvival and reproduction apparently without any need to invoke the moderating\neVect of marriage. The juvenile-onset cases died at ages 13, 15 and 18, however, whilst\nthe youngest age at marriage in the sample was 17 years. This suggests that although\nthe mechanisms may be categorically distinct, there can be an overlap between their\noperation in practice, with juvenile-onset cases who survive long enough to reach\nmarriageable age remaining unmarried notwithstanding their maturity.\nFor those patients who did not marry, even though they survived until adulthood,\nthere are a number of possible explanations for their celibacy. They might simply\nhappen not to have married, just as a proportion of the unaVected population would\nhave remained single. The proportion of unmarried patients was too high at 43% (or\n32% if those with childhood onset who died by 18 years of age are discounted) for\n368 Lima et al.\nthis to be an adequate explanation for all cases. Celibacy rates for the general and\nregional Portuguese population (Livi Bacci, 1971) show that in the period 1900\u20131960\nthe proportion of single females aged 50\u201354 years fell from 21\u00b74% to 16%, with the\nproportion of men declining from 13% to 10\u00b74%. Figures for the proportion of single\nfemales aged 50\u201354 years within the Azores were slightly higher than these general\nfigures in the administrative district of Angra and slightly lower in the district of\nPonta Delgada. In view of these rates, it seems likely that \u2018natural\u2019 celibacy can\nprovide only a partial explanation for the large proportion of unmarried MJD\npatients.\nThe unmarried patients might have intended to marry, but failed to do so because\nthe onset of the disease came before they had chosen a partner, and once symptoms\nappeared they or their potential mates decided against marriage. Alternatively, they\nmight have remained celibate regardless of age of onset, either by their own choice,\nrestrained by the knowledge that they were at risk of developing MJD, or avoided as\nmarriage partners by others for the same reason. Celibacy in these situations can be\nreferred to as either \u2018symptom-based\u2019 or \u2018restraint-based\u2019. These possibilities can be\ndistinguished by referring to Fig. 1. If fear of later occurrence were as potent a\ndeterrent to marriage as the development of symptoms itself, no diVerence in the\ndistribution of age at onset between the married and unmarried cases would be\nexpected. It can be recalled, however, that there was a skewing of unmarried cases\ntowards early age at onset, with 56% unmarried in the group with onset below 35\nyears of age compared with only 14% unmarried among those with onset at 35 years\nof age or more. This discrepancy in proportions suggests that at least some of those\nunmarried cases with MJD onset at ages 27, 29, 31, 33 and 34 were single people\nwithin the normal range of age at marriage whose intention had been to marry, but\nwho were prevented from doing so by onset of the disease. Unfortunately, these data\ndo not allow complete confidence in this judgement, since in general the age at\nmarriage in this sample was lower than the age at onset of the disease.\nThere is circumstantial evidence of such behaviour in the distributions of age at\nmarriage and age at onset of MJD. Figure 2 shows these data plotted for each of the\nmarried cases. Although the mean age at onset (42\u00b75&15\u00b77) was much higher than\nmean age at marriage (24\u00b74&4\u00b79), as stated previously, there was considerable overlap\nbetween their distributions. Yet there were no cases in which marriage occurred after\nonset. This can be interpreted to indicate that people did not get married once the\nsymptoms of MJD had become apparent. The skewing of the unmarried cases\ntowards the earlier age of onset, together with the fact that there was no case in which\nmarriage took place after onset, implies that for the early-onset cases onset of the\ndisease played a part in the decision not to marry. In practice, perhaps some of the\nearly-onset unmarried cases had delayed marriage in case symptoms developed, only\nto be confirmed in their celibacy at the onset of MJD. In such a case \u2018restraint-based\ncelibacy\u2019 would be overtaken by \u2018symptom-based celibacy\u2019 later in life. With regard\nto the later-onset unmarried cases it is assumed that their condition is a combination\nof \u2018natural\u2019 celibacy perhaps together with some element of restraint, though it might\nbe questioned whether \u2018natural\u2019 celibacy is a state consistent with the consciousness\nof being at risk. In a dataset of this sort it is impossible to identify the reason why\nany particular individual remained unmarried, and it is diYcult to attribute celibacy\nNatural selection at the MJD locus 369\nexclusively to one or other cause, since once symptoms of MJD have developed the\nconcepts of \u2018restraint-based\u2019 and \u2018natural\u2019 celibacy can no longer apply. Thus, as has\nbeen seen in the case of juvenile-onset cases living to marriageable age, one cause may\ngive way to another during the life course.\nFor the second prediction, that clinical type and age of onset would reduce marital\nfertility through the premature cessation of reproduction after onset of symptoms, no\nsupport was found. Comparison of the number of children born to married patients\nof the three clinical types showed no diVerence in reproductive output between them,\neven though the Type 3 patients survived significantly longer on average than Types\n1 and 2. Furthermore, the test devised to examine the eVects of disease status in\ncutting short the reproduction of married patients after onset showed no diVerence in\nfamily size between those with onset during the reproductive period and those with\nonset after the age of 50. At a descriptive level the subject of age at onset and\ncontinued procreation can be pursued still further. Among the seven married patients\nwith age at onset of 35 years or younger, the mean family size was 4\u00b700, and among\nthe four in whom the disease started before the age of 35, mean family size was 4\u00b750.\nThus, no evidence was found that early onset of the disease after marriage led to a\nreduction in marital fertility, even though reproduction continued after onset of the\ndisease in only three cases.\nThe authors\u2019 interpretation of these data is that selection against MJD is mediated\nby marital status alone, rather than through reduction of marital fertility. It is not\nclear at what stage the decision not to marry takes place. In some cases, it may be\nthat the development of symptoms prevents marriage; in others, that the family legacy\nof MJD reduces the likelihood of marriage, either through self-imposed restraint, or\nthrough an aversion exercised by potential marriage partners. The case-control\napproach used by Lima et al. (1997b) might be used to confirm this finding if\nreproductive output could be measured in terms of the number of grandchildren\nrather than children, though in view of the diYculty in calculating pedigrees to this\nlevel in a population with such a high emigration rate as the Azores, a surrogate\nmeasure such as \u2018children who marry\u2019 could be taken as an alternative. Another\napproach would be to compare the nuptiality and reproductive success of aVected\nindividuals with that of their unaVected sibs.\nTo summarize, the results show that clinical type is associated with reproductive\nsuccess, as predicted. However, this eVect appears to be entirely due to the lower rate\nof marriage among Type 1 MJD patients. Among married patients there was no\ndependence of fertility on clinical type or age at onset. In other words, natural\nselection against the MJD gene seems to have operated solely through the lack of\nreproductive success of the unmarried cases.\nThese results have significance for the debate about the regulation of the number\nof CAG repeats, and the assessment of the number of CAG repeats in Azorean MJD\npatients will provide the opportunity to integrate molecular features with their\nreproductive and clinical characteristics. Frontali et al. (1996) proposed a model of\nselective loss in each generation of the majority of alleles with the largest number of\nrepeats and their replenishment by the expansion of alleles in the low-to-medium\nrepeat range. Such a mechanism of selective elimination of the largest CAG repeat\nnumbers is entirely consistent with the results of the present study, which has\n370 Lima et al.\ndemonstrated natural selection against early-onset forms of MJD associated with the\nmost highly repeated CAG sequences.\nAcknowledgments\nFinancial support was provided by a grant from the Government of the Azores\n(Projecto Regional Integrado sobre a doen\u00e7a de Machado-Joseph).
