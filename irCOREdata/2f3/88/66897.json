Participatory \nAction Research and Geography Teaching\u201d) \nCommentary: \nWorking Across Distant Spaces: \nConnecting Participatory Action Research and Teaching \n \nAbstract \nThis commentary reflects on the key themes and goals of this symposium issue. It \ncontextualises the relationship between participatory action research (PAR) and \nteaching in the increasingly popular field of critical action-oriented geography. It \nconsiders a number of benefits to student learning from engagement with PAR, \ndrawing on the papers in the collection, and raises some critical questions for future \ndevelopment.    \n \n \nFor many geographers, teaching and research take place in separate spaces. The \nteaching\/research nexus may be a \u201ccomplex and contested relationship\u201d (Healey, \n2005, 195), but the links are often weak (Jenkins, 2000), the relationship \npredominantly one-way (Healey, 2005) and, in many countries, the dichotomy \nbetween them is growing (LeHeron et al, 2006). Some of the best teaching is \ninformed by others\u2019 research and our own; sometimes we talk about a two-way flow \nwhere students\u2019 engagement with our research material (or the simple act of having to \ndistil it) enriches our thinking when we are back in research mode. But this isn\u2019t \nanything like an equal exchange. As Cook et al. (2007) have recently demonstrated, \ndirect student engagement in research issues, and the challenge of drawing on and \nsituating their own experiences and values, not only democratizes but enriches \nteaching and learning for all concerned.  \n The common distance between researchers\/researched can be viewed as in direct \nparallel to this separation of teaching\/research, and of teachers\/learners. The pursuit of \nresearch knowledge is informed predominantly by our engagements as academics \nwith academia. For most, it is this narrow sphere in which the aims of our research are \ngenerated, in which findings are analysed and interpreted, from which certain theories \nare drawn in explanation, and where we publish. Informants and respondents \u2018out \nthere\u2019 in the wider world are drawn on as sources of data, but in reality they are rarely \ninvolved in any other stage of research processes.  \n \nGenerally, then, there is considerable distance between these various spaces of \nacademic activity, a hierarchical scaling accorded them, and a fixedness to the power \nrelations inside and between them. The issue of this symposium, linking Participatory \nAction Research with University teaching, presents a radical challenge to this \ndistance; it destabilises longstanding patterns of academic activity through connecting \nthese spaces. It is one expression of the recent resurgence of activism and \nparticipatory modes of research engagement in human geography. As Sara Kindon \nand Sarah Elwood make clear in their inspiring and nuanced overview, the work of a \nfew earlier pioneers such as Bunge (1977) has some resonance with the larger projects \ndescribed here. But on the research front, geographers are today engaging to a far \ngreater degree in Participatory Action Research (PAR) approaches: co-researching \nwith, rather than on, communities, and establishing reciprocal partnerships (see \nCahill, 2007; Kindon, 2005; Kindon et al., 2007). The present resurgence challenges \nthe discrete spaces of academic activity by drawing activism closer into \nconventionally \u2018academic\u2019 activities in geography, and geographers into activist \nventures outside (see Routledge 1996).  \n \nUp until this symposium, teaching and supervision have figured far less in these \ndiscussions. Partly in response to calls in the discipline for critical action-oriented \nresearch that directly challenges social injustice through its practices, Noel Castree \n(1999) and others have argued for the political potential of teaching as one of the most \neffective ways that we as University teachers and researchers can effect social and \npolitical change. The exciting promise of this symposium is that the editors and \nauthors ably dismantle any binary between research and teaching: their emphasis is on \neffecting change through teaching and research by closing the conventional gap \nbetween them.  \n \nThe symposium comes at a critical time, then, with its assertion that participatory \nprinciples, values and practices in one sphere of academic life can and should transfer \nover to the others. The editors and authors are developing highly innovative practices \nthat connect teaching, research and activism directly in their own programmes. While \nintegrating PAR with teaching has many potential benefits for all of the parties \ninvolved - Universities, academic and community researchers, outside organisations \nand those affected by the social, economic or environmental policies that these \nprojects may engage with - my main focus in what follows is evaluating the benefits \nto students\u2019 learning. The papers provide quite different examples of high quality \nteaching and learning through engagement in PAR in particular contexts. Together \nthey make up a rich, energising and instructive collection, but this is a relatively new \nfield for geographers, and I also point to some questions for future reflection.  \n Enriching Students\u2019 Learning: Theory, Positionality, Ethics\u2026and Mess \nThe first benefit evident from all of the papers is that engaging in PAR practice helps \nto engage students in a deeper understanding of theory. In participatory research, \ntheory, practice and change are approached as equivalent and fully integrated partners \n(Pain and Kindon 2007). For example, Meghan Cope\u2019s project with children who \nattend an after-school facility fulfilled the requirements of an undergraduate course, \nenhancing the teaching of children\u2019s geographies through students co-creating \nknowledge with children and through the encouragement of theoretically informed \nreflection among students. Meghan also talks about benefits to her own learning that \ncome from interacting with and reflecting on students\u2019 experiences, offering some \nimportant critical insights into participatory research with children. Sarah Elwood\u2019s \nproject focuses on students\u2019 theoretical as well as practical learning of GIS, \ndemonstrating that these knowledges would not have been developed or integrated to \nthe same extent or as effectively without the hands-on and personal engagements \noutside the University. As Sarah puts it, \u201cin these partnerships, students\u2019 conceptual \nand methodological learning is not situated in the classroom and then demonstrated in \nthe field collaboration, but rather, is situated in both places simultaneously\u201d. \n \nSecondly, engaging in PAR always involves (or should involve) confrontation and \nreappraisal of our own positionalities, values and sets of ethics. Indeed this can be one \nof the most challenging aspects of engaging with PAR, professionally and personally. \nFor students, who tend to come from more privileged social backgrounds than \naverage, this can be thrown into sharp relief (see Mountz et al., forthcoming). For \neducators, the reflection that PAR demands from participants on their values and \nworldviews is a major benefit, alongside the soft skills that Sara Kindon and Sarah \nElwood identify. An especially valuable insight from Meghan Cope\u2019s paper is her \ndiscussion of attitudes that are harmful to PAR with children. The project proved \nchallenging to some students when faced with the realities of poverty. One of the \nunsettling aspects of doing PAR is recognising prejudices and stereotypes in \nourselves, and when learning takes place only in lecture theatres or libraries we are \nunlikely to confront this in quite the same way. Meghan offers helpful reflection on \nworking through and with staff and students\u2019 positionalities and values when they are \nat odds with the worlds we enter outside academia.  \n \nOn the face of it, the subject which Sarah Elwood teaches is one of the most difficult \nthrough which to engage students in participatory research: as she outlines, GIS have \nbeen critiqued for producing remote and authoritarian forms of knowledge. The \ntechnology may attract students with particular ways of knowing and ideas about who \nknowledge should benefit, which do not sit easily with the democratic principles and \npractices of PAR. All of the authors remind us that students as well as researchers \ntake on the challenge of PAR in particular ways - their varying backgrounds, \npersonalities, values and politics mean they relate to projects and non-academic co-\nresearchers differently. These differences can be constructive if we work across them \n(Pratt, 2007). Students are a diverse group, bringing experience and expertise which \nchallenge and enrich the thinking and practices of researchers and other participants.    \n \nThirdly, participatory ethics can often collide with institutional norms about what \nethical research is (see Cahill et al., 2007). Participatory modes of teaching in the \nclassroom, as well as participatory research in the field, can acknowledge and build \nupon students\u2019 previous knowledges and their existing ethical values. Participatory \nteaching here involves the premise that students have critical capacities which are \nengaged and enrich their understanding (Askins 2007; see also Hopkins, 2006).  In the \ncontext of PAR, research ethics are viewed not as something imposed from above, but \nas requiring careful negotiation between researchers and subjects, respecting and \ntaking account of differing moral and political positions (see Askins 2007; Manzo and \nBrightbill 2007; Sanderson and Kindon, 2004;). \n \nFourthly, all of the papers acknowledge the messiness and complexity of research \nrealities, and that it is not just academically acceptable but vital for students to expect \nmess and learn to navigate through it. For example, for Sarah Elwood, the most \nvaluable understanding her students gain is not just how GIS work, but how they \nwork within specific social, cultural and political settings. In moving between \ncurriculum, classroom and field, her students navigate some of the messiness of real \nresearch collaborations and see that things work out unpredictably in the field. \nAttention to the spatialities of participation is an important learning tool here, as \nparticipation, its processes and outcomes are partly determined by circumstances and \nsettings (Kesby et al., 2005, Kesby, 2007). Related to the messiness of our own \npositions, Pamela Moss\u2019s assertion is an important one: that there is no need to \nbalance competing requirements, but rather seek a continual \u2018movement between \nintellectual positionings and activist settings\u2019. Being open about mess is seen by many \nPAR researchers as an essential part of individual and collective reflexive \ndevelopment, and far more instructive about the deeper issues of justice, power and \npolitics in research than \u2018clean\u2019 depictions of practice (Kapoor, 2002).  \n \nCritical questions \nI also want to highlight a number of questions that are raised by this symposium issue. \nThe first is how to negotiate and address the barriers to working across the \ntraditionally separate spaces of research and teaching using PAR. Increasingly, the \nactivism that some geographers are enacting in their research and teaching needs to be \ntargeted at the institutional structures, policies, practices and cultures that constrain \nthis sort of working. Barriers include the conflicting priorities and responses of \ndifferent worlds as they come face to face; the constraints imposed by institutional \nnorms and demands; and enduring attitudes among colleagues about where academic \nstaff and students should be focusing their energies. This last point may have an \nespecially constraining effect on new and junior academic staff, on whom pressures to \nperform in certain ways may be greatest (see Salem and Foote, 2006). While PAR \nraises new sets of tensions and constraints, there are also opportunities and \ncontradictions of which we might take advantage. In the UK, for example, while the \neffect of research auditing is to place teaching as a poor relation (Jenkins, 1995), the \nregional agenda expects universities to be embedded in, and to contribute to, their \nimmediate localities. Too often the emphasis is on the University as the \nknowledgeable partner, and the region as receiving knowledge, rather than any radical \nrethink of knowledge hierarchies through local communities adding value. But as Sara \nKindon and Sarah Elwood point out, there are significant differences between types of \ninstitution and between national higher education regimes, with the \nUniversity\/community partnerships that facilitate linking up teaching with PAR \ntaking different forms. Many will share Pamela Moss\u2019s feeling that it is hard to do \nactivist research \u2018because of the rising expectations of academic excellence\u2019. Yet as \nher own work shows excellence and participatory activism are not opposing poles \n(further examples are given in Pain, 2007). Moreover, engaging with and attempting \nto rework what \u2018excellence\u2019 means in academic contexts constitutes another site of \nresistance. The language of \u2018excellence\u2019 and \u2018world-leading\u2019 \u2013 increasingly applied \nby Anglo-American geography departments - is pompous, and tends to contain \nnarrow views of both excellence and the world.  \n  \nSecondly, what other ways are there of relating the distant spaces of teaching and \nresearch, and what can we learn from them? It would be paradoxical to suggest that \nPAR is the only means of linking teaching and research in material ways, opening up \nthe academy and students\u2019 experiences to the lives and concerns of those outside, or \npursuing action- or activism-oriented research and teaching - there is no suggestion of \nthat didactic position within this symposium. Though they are relatively few and far \nbetween in the literature on teaching, there are other modes of engagement which can \nspeak to and potentially enrich our practice of PAR: for example, Ian Cook\u2019s thought-\nprovoking paper written with his undergraduate students suggests situating academic \ndebates and issues in students\u2019 own lives, and so placing the classroom as sites of \nlearning for students and researchers (Cook et al., 2007). In her highly reflexive paper \nhere, Pamela Moss talks of the dilemmas she faces in negotiating the supervisory \nrelationship with her postgraduate students. While many come armed with feminist \npolitics, experienced in activism, and keen and highly motivated, her students face \nconstraints on their involvement in community research. The students described in the \npaper eventually chose to use discourse analysis for their dissertations rather than \ndirect participatory methods. Pamela has come to see this as a form of activism which \nis as useful to many of her students who hold roles outside the academy alongside \npursuing postgraduate study, including in their workplaces or as community activists. \nThis is a point which resonates, as PAR opposes any privileging of some forms of \nknowing over others. Rather theory, practice, and change are seen as intimately \nbound, and many theoretical and methodological strategies have radical potential. \nWhat needs to be confronted is the very narrow range of experiences of theories, \nmethods and practices to which many students are exposed. \n \nThirdly, in the spirit of keeping a critical eye on participatory processes, we should \nask what participation really means in different student\/community encounters? To \nwhat degree are projects participatory, and at what stages? How (and how far) is \nauthority truly shared, who is producing knowledge, and who does the process benefit \n(see Mountz et al. forthcoming)? There is no sense of glossing over these issues, and \nno lack of criticality, in any of the papers here. But there are further questions, and \nmore will arise as practice continues to expand. For example, we could ask where do \nresearch questions and agendas come from, and how far are they negotiated? How do \nwe support students when projects diverge from expected paths, follow up new lines \nof enquiry, or participants choose to adopt methods that they and students have no \ntraining in supporting? How are students prepared for the responsibility of dealing \nwith community participants\u2019 expectations, differences and tensions over the course \nof the project? And what happens when they themselves come into conflict with \nparticipants, harming relationships that academic and community partners may have \nnurtured for years? All this is not to suggest that PAR involving students is much \nmore fraught with danger than PAR involving academic staff: the literature is littered \nwith examples of \u2018faux PAR\u2019 (Pratt, 2007). What is needed is a proliferation of \nresources and examples of practice that can support and guide students, staff and \ncommunity researchers past potential pitfalls. \n Finally, one of our key concerns as academics on a day to day basis is simple: how \ncan we fit it all in? Meeting the increasing and sometimes competing demands of \nworking in higher education \u2013 teaching, research, administration, outreach - alongside \nmaintaining any sort of work\/life balance, is challenging. As Sara Kindon and Sarah \nElwood point out, linking PAR and teaching in the ways outlined does not make for \nan easier, more streamlined professional life, and is a choice made for ethical, moral \nand educational rather than simply strategic reasons. The projects are demanding of \nstaff time and capacities: the authors here have exceptional skills to organise and \nnavigate between different groups and settings involved in their research and \npedagogy. Elsewhere, Mountz et al. (forthcoming) point to the gendering and \nracialisation of community engagement and activist scholarship: women and people \nof colour, while still seriously under-represented among geography staff, are \ndisproportionately involved in this type of work. It is rarely given reasonable \nrecognition in promotion or tenure criteria, and so the hours and sustained \ninvolvement spent on this type of work tend to be minimised on applications and \nCVs. Universities should alter their tenure and promotion criteria to recognise this \nstrategically important work (Mountz et al., forthcoming). \n \nThis symposium provides a very valuable resource for those who want to connect the \ndifferent spaces and activities of human geography through more participatory \npractices. It further highlights that participation in geography is about far more than \n\u2018methods\u2019: it is suggestive of transformation of every sphere of our activities. There \nare barriers to bringing together distant and discrete spaces, but enormous potential \nrewards for all spheres of activity. PAR can lead to more inspiring and enriching \nlearning, as students are not just observing, or talking to, but collaborating with \npeople outside the academy in creating knowledge. PAR involves continual critical \nexamination of beliefs, attitudes and values underpinning research, and constant work \nto connect theory, research practice and social change. These endeavours are ones that \nour wider institutions would be well placed to scale up and pursue.  \n \nReferences \n \nAskins, K. (2007) Codes, committees and other such conundrums.
