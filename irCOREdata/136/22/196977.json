They arise quickly\nbetween subjects in any kind of environment and they condition the behavior of the subjects\ninvolved. Di\u000berent degrees of social relationships exist between various individuals, including\nfamily members, work mates, partners, friends, and among all of these, friendship relations\nrepresent one of the most intriguing aspects of social relationships. But while every person\ncan identify his friends if asked, it is di\u000ecult to de\fne exactly what friendship means.\nThe most frequently cited characteristics of friendship are: helping, reciprocity and a\nlimited number of friends (See, for example, Hruschka and Henrich (2004), Silk (2002), Hal-\nlinan (1979), de Vos and Zeggelink (1997), van de Bunt, van de Duijn and Snijders (1999)\nor Zeggelink (1995)). Mutual help between friends implies that friends help each other in\ntimes of necessity. The exchange or reciprocity means that people expect from their friends a\nsimilar attitude to the one that they have towards them. Finally, a limited number of friends\nsimply means that subjects do not have as many friends as they would like since keeping up\nfriendship relations takes time and e\u000bort.\nThis paper presents a model that tries to reproduce these three facts: helping, reciprocity\nand a limited number of friends. The interactions between a group of players are modeled\nin the following repeated setting: Each period every player has to decide which players in\nthe population she wants to help. Helping involves a cost for the player who provides help\nbut there is also a bene\ft for the player receiving help. In game-theoretical terms, we model\nthe decision of helping as a cooperation game of a class of prisoners' dilemma game. We call\nthis cooperative game the Helping Game. If two players are helping each other (playing the\ncooperative equilibrium) they are called friends. Providing help can be interpreted as any of\nthe acts friends do for each other: providing emotional support, lending money, etc.\nThe cost of providing help is exogenous and depends on the amount of help the player one\nwants to help needs. A players' need for help could be considered as the degree of sociability\nof that player. Players are di\u000berent according to the amount of help they need. The bene\ft\nfrom receiving help is kept constant to keep the analysis simpler. Each player is able to\nprovide help for only a limited number of times per time period. This represents the fact\nthat helping is time-consuming.\nAs mentioned above, our aim is to construct a model that, based on helping, reciprocity\nand a limited number of friends, is able to explain some of the phenomena that we observe\nbetween friends in the real world. From the preceding paragraph it is clear how we make use\nof helping and the limited number of friends. To implement reciprocity, the strategy that\nwe use for supporting cooperation (providing help) is the well known Grim Trigger strategy\n2\n(Axelrod (1984)). According to Grim Trigger strategies, a player will keep on providing help\nto another player as long as they both helped each other in the past. Because Grim Trigger\nstrategies do not allow for forgiveness, we assume that in any period, a defection that occurred\nin the past is forgiven with some small probability.\nIn our results we explore the role of similarity (homophily) in determining friendship\nrelations. It has been reported in empirical studies that similar people (those who share same\nhobbies, race, etc.) are more likely to be friends. For example, Marmaros and Sacerdote\n(2004), using the number of emails exchanged between students from Dartmouth College,\nfound that similarity in age, geographic closeness, race and interests increase the likelihood\nof two people becoming friends. According to our model, players prefer to be friends with\nplayers that do not need much help. This means that players tend to be grouped by the\namount of help they need. Hence, as in Jackson and Rogers (2007), popular players tend\nto group with other popular players. However, when two players are similar they can be\nregarded as substitutes by other players. Thus, similarity is needed for friendship but a\ncertain degree of di\u000berentiation is also needed to determine which friendship relations can\nemerge.\nIn Section 3, we characterize the structure of the friendship networks that can emerge\nin the long-run. As already mentioned, if two players are similar, then a certain degree\nof substitutability exists between them. Thus, for some sets of players there is no unique\nprediction. We characterize the friendship networks that can exist, and the set of friendship\nnetworks that cannot exist. By studying shot-run dynamics, more light can be shed on the\nissue of uniqueness.\nTo explore the evolution of the friendship network in the short-run we consider a situation\nwhere in the beginning, players are unaware of the existence of other players. Every period\ntwo players meet and, if it is in their interest, become friends. This simple dynamics allows\nus to better understand how long-run friendship networks come to exist. We \fnd that some\nfriendships emerge in the \frst periods only because the parties involved do not have other\nalternatives. As time goes on, players meet other players and it is then that the selection of\nfriendships takes place.\nMany sociological, physiological and anthropological papers have modeled the process\nof friendship formation. For example, in a paper by Zeggelink (1995), friends have a \fxed\ndesired number of friends and each player is de\fned by a dichotomous variable (they are\neither type-1 player or type-2 player). Each player tries to have the desired number of friends\nand to maximize the similarity of his type with the type of his friends. The author performs\nsimulations and \fnds that groups of players of the same type tend to form friendships.\n3\nThe model presented in this paper also di\u000bers from the economic models of social networks\npioneered by Jackson and Wolinsky (1995) and Bala and Goyal (2000). It di\u000bers from Jackson\nand Wolinsky (1995) in that in our model, the payo\u000bs are not determined solely by the state\nof the friendship network but are also a\u000bected by the actions of the players with whom they\nare not friends. It di\u000bers from Bala and Goyal (2000) in that when two players share a link,\nthey then play a cooperative game and not a coordination game.\nTo our knowledge, two papers examine the issue of social networks when players play a\ncooperative game. These are Lippert and Spagnolo (2005) and Vega-Redondo (2005). The\n\frst one focuses on the information transmission about the defectors in the network and on\nthe di\u000berent punishment mechanism for supporting cooperation. On the other hand, Vega-\nRedondo (2005) explores the amount of cooperation that will emerge in the network when\nthe environment su\u000bers from aggregate shocks to payo\u000bs.\nA paper dealing with friendship networks is that of Currarini et al (2009). The authors\npresent a formal model where a player's decision at each point in time is whether or not to\nstay in the matching process. Staying increases the number of friends a player has whilst by\nquitting, the player simply keeps her friends. A taste for similarity is exogenously introduced:\nthe utility derived from a friendship relation depends on the type of both players involved.\nIn our model the taste for similarity is endogenous, as it is the result of the di\u000berences in the\namount of help each player needs.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we develop the model. Section\n3 characterizes the equilibrium friendship networks. In Section 4, a dynamic setting to study\nthe short-run friendship network is presented. Section 5 relates our results with empirical\n\fndings on friendship and present some extensions. Finally, Section 6 concludes.\n2 The Model\nAssume a population N of n \u0015 2 players who discount the future at a common rate \u000e 2 (0; 1).\nLet i and k stand for two typical elements of N . Each player i is characterized by the amount\nof help she needs pi 2 (0; 1). Every time period t = 1; 2; : : : every player faces a one-shot\ngame with every other player. In this game, which we call the Helping Game, the two players\nhave to decide simultaneously whether to help H the other or not N .\nThe payo\u000b scheme of the Helping Game works as follows. If a player o\u000bers help to the\nother player, then she has to bear a cost cp with c 2 (0; 1], where p is the amount of help the\nother player needs. If a player is being helped by the other player, then she obtains a bene\ft\nx 2 [c; 1]. The payo\u000b matrix for the Helping Game played by player i, row, and player k,\n4\ncolumn, is given in Table 1.\nTable 1: Helping Game\nH N\nH x\u0000 cpk; x\u0000 cpi \u0000cpk; x\nN x;\u0000cpi 0; 0\nAs it is clear from the payo\u000b matrix in Table 1 the Helping Game has the standard\nPrisoners' Dilemma structure.\nAs is well known from the Folk theorem in repeated games, in\fnitely many strategies can\nform Nash equilibria. Hence, we shall restrict the strategy space of the agents to make the\nmodel tractable. In our model, players can only make two types of plans, the Cooperative\nPlan and the Defective Plan.\nCooperative Play according to Grim Trigger (de\fned below).\nDefective Play N .\nDe\fnition 1. De\fne the Grim Trigger strategy for player i playing against any\nplayer k as follows:\n\u000f If a play in any past period against k was either (H;N) or (N;H), then play N .\n\u000f Otherwise, play H.\nThe Grim Trigger strategy prescribes helping the other player unless any of the two players\nplayed not cooperatively with the other in the past. Note that due to the way in which we\nde\fne the Grim Trigger strategy, players are protected against possible deviations from the\nother player when both are playing H.\nOur choice of these two speci\fc plans is motivated by the following proposition.\nProposition 1. The Cooperative Plan is the best (i.e. for a bigger parameter set) rational-\nizable strategy that supports cooperation. Furthermore, the Defective Plan is the best possible\ndeviation against the Cooperative Plan.\nProof. For the \frst part of the proposition it su\u000eces to notice that the easiest way of making\nthe cooperative outcome possible, in the sense that it can be sustained for a bigger set of\nparameter values, is via a strategy that threatens the opponent with playing N forever if a\ndeviation ever occurs.\n5\nThe second part of the proposition follows easily. The best one-period gain can be achieved\nby playing N when the other player plays H, which is what the Defective Plan prescribes.\nMoreover, once a deviation occurs, the Cooperative Plan prescribes playing N forever, and\na best response in the repeated game is to also play N forever, which is again what the\nDefective Plan prescribes.\nWhat we mean by rationalizable strategy can be better understood with the following\nexample. Consider the strategy where both players in the Helping Game always play H. This\nstrategy, although making cooperation possible for any parameter values, is not rationalizable\nas it is a best response to switch to play N in all periods.\nThe Cooperative Plan, although having the convenient property stated in Proposition 1,\ndoes not allow for forgiveness, a feature that is very much present in friendship relations. We\nassume that at every period, two players forgive a deviation that might have occurred in the\npast between them with some small probability \" > 0. Players do not know this fact and\nbelieve that once a friendship relation is broken, it will never be set up again. This belief is\nalmost correct as \" is small and the discount factor is smaller than one.\nIf two players are playing the Cooperative Plan with each other, we de\fne them as friends.\nWe constrain the agents to provide help at most m 2 f1; : : : ; n \u0000 1g times per period and,\nhence, each player can have at most m friends in any given period. The words \\betrays\" and\n\\betrayal\" are used throughout the paper. Here are their formal de\fnitions:\nDe\fnition 2. We say that a player i betrays player k if they were friends in the last\nperiod, but in the current period i does not help k. That is, they both played H against each\nother in the past round but i switches to N . We say there has been a betrayal between two\nplayers if they were friends in the last period but at least one of them betrays the other in\nthe current period.\nBefore we proceed, it is useful to examine the conditions under which a friendship relation\nis possible and the conditions under which a betrayal between two friends is pro\ftable. Here\nand henceforth, we assume that in the cutting edge (indi\u000berence) cases, friendship does not\nsurvive. Conditions (1) and (2) below appear several times in the analysis that follows.\nRemark 1. Assume that the population consists only of players i and k, and that they are\nboth employing the Cooperative Plan. Player i has no incentives to deviate to the Defective\nPlan if and only if\npk < \u000ex=c: (1)\nAssume the population consists only of players i, k and l and that m = 1. If players i and\nk are playing the Cooperative Plan with each other, then the situation where player i switches\n6\nto the Defective Plan against k and plays the Cooperative Plan with l and player l plays the\nCooperative Plan with i is not pro\ftable for i if and only if\npl \u0000 pk \u0015 (1\u0000 \u000e)x=c: (2)\nBy Remark 1, all players whose need for help is greater or equal to \u000ex=c cannot set up any\nfriendship relations because for the other player involved the one period gain from betraying\nalways o\u000bsets the long-run loss.\nLet N\u0000i = N r fig. De\fne the set of actions in the Helping Game as A = fH;Ng. Let\nhtik be the action played by player i against player k in period t. If players i and k forgive\na deviation that occurred between themselves at time t, then we set htik = h\nt\nki = ?. Let\nHtik 2 fA\u0002Ag\nt\u00001 be the set of all possible histories between players i and k till the beginning\nof period t \u0015 1, and set H0ik = ?. De\fne H\nt\ni = (H\nt\nij)j2N\u0000i and H\nt = (Htj)j2N .\nDe\fne the strategy of player i against player k at time t as Stik : H\nt\ni ! A. Note that\nwe are constraining Stik to be either the Cooperative Plan (S\nt\nik = CP ) or the Defective Plan\n(Stik = DP ). De\fne S\nt\ni = (S\nt\nij)j2N\u0000i and S\nt = (Stj)j2N . The state of the population at any\npoint in time t is given by (Ht; St). Finally, de\fne the payo\u000b at time t of player i for a given\nstate of the population (Ht; St) as \u0019ti(H\nt; St).\nThe equilibrium de\fnition that we use throughout is based on the pairwise stability\nconcept of Jackson and Wolinsky (1996):\nDe\fnition 3. At time t, a con\fguration of strategies St is a pairwise equilibrium with\nrespect to history Ht if and only if the following two conditions hold:\n\u000f No unilateral deviation is pro\ftable: There exists no i and S^ti such that\n\u0019ti\n\u0010\nHt;\n\u0010\n(Stj)j2N\u0000i ; S^\nt\ni\n\u0011\u0011\n> \u0019ti\n\u0000\nHt; St\n\u0001\n:\n\u000f No bilateral deviation is pro\ftable: There exists no i; k and S^ti ; S^\nt\nk such that both\n\u0019ti\n\u0010\nHt;\n\u0010\n(Stj)j2N\u0000fi;kg ; S^\nt\ni ; S^\nt\nk\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0015 \u0019ti\n\u0000\nHt; St\n\u0001\n;\n\u0019tk\n\u0010\nHt;\n\u0010\n(Stj)j2N\u0000fi;kg ; S^\nt\ni ; S^\nt\nk\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0015 \u0019tk\n\u0000\nHt; St\n\u0001\nhold with at least one strict inequality.\nGiven that we are only considering two pure strategies here, for a given history Ht, a\npairwise equilibrium may not exist at time t. This does not represent a problem for the\nanalysis as it will be clear once the static analysis and the dynamics are presented.\n7\n3 Static Analysis\n3.1 Three-Player Game\nIn order to get a better understanding of the model, we focus \frst on the case where the\npopulation consists of three players and m = 1. Furthermore, for this discussion we assume\nthat no betrayals took place between any of the players in the population.\nAssume that p1 < p2 < p3. The \frst question that arises is whether a friendship relation\nis possible between any two players if the third player did not exist. By Remark 1, if p2 \u0015\n\u000ex\nc\n,\nno friendship relations are possible and, thus, in the unique pairwise equilibrium no player\nhas friends.\nAssume now that p2 <\n\u000ex\nc\nand that p3 \u0015\n\u000ex\nc\n. In this case, the only possible friendship is\nbetween players 1 and 2. Thus, in the unique pairwise equilibrium players 1 and 2 are friends\nwhile 3 remains alone.\nAssume that p3 <\n\u000ex\nc\n, so that all friendship relations are, in principle, possible. Further-\nmore, assume that p3 \u0000 p2 > (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n. In this case if players 1 and 2 are friends, neither of\nthem has an incentive to play the Defective Plan against the other and became friends with\nplayer 3: from the point of view of player 1, the one-period gain from the deviation is o\u000bset\nby the loss from being friends with player 3 instead of with player 2. Therefore, in this case,\nthere is a unique pairwise equilibrium in which once again players 1 and 2 are friends and\nplayer 3 is alone.\nFinally, assume that p3 <\n\u000ex\nc\nand that p3 \u0000 p1 < (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n. Then, for each friendship\nrelation, one of the players in the relation \fnds it pro\ftable to switch to the Defective Plan\nwith his current friend and to start playing the Cooperative Plan with the third one if the\nthird player also corresponds by switching to the Cooperative Plan. Thus, for a history where\nno betrayals took place, no con\fguration of strategies can be part of a pairwise equilibrium.\nFurther cases exist but these are all considered in the next section for the general n-player\ngame.\nIt is clear that similarity plays a central role in the friendship relations. For example; in\nthe \frst case, where p3 <\n\u000ex\nc\nand p3\u0000 p2 > (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n, players 2 and 3 are not similar enough,\nso in the long-run the player who needs help the least, player 1, prefers player 2 as a friend\nover player 3. As already mentioned, studying how similarity a\u000bects friendship relations is\nthe main aim of this paper.\n8\n3.2 n-Player Game\nWe now turn our attention back to the general case were the population consists of n \u0015 2\nplayers. Without loss of generality players are labeled in such a way that pi \u0014 pk if and only\ni \u0014 k. Thus, player 1 needs the least help while player n needs the most help. In order to\ncharacterize the pairwise equilibria we need some de\fnitions.\nDe\fnition 4. De\fne the First Invariant Equilibrium Component (IEC1) as the set\nof players f1; : : : ; ig where i is the maximum natural number i \u0014 m+ 1 such that\npi <\n\u000ex\nc\n;\npi+1 \u0000 pi \u0015 (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n:\nRecursively, consider the reduced population Ij = N r[s<jIECs. Let uj\u00001 = #[s\u0014j\u00001 IECs\nand de\fne the j-th Invariant Equilibrium Component (IECj) as the set of players\nfuj\u00001 + 1; : : : ; uj\u00001 + ig 2 Ij where i is the maximum natural number i \u0014 m+ 1 such that\npuj\u00001+i <\n\u000ex\nc\n;\npuj\u00001+i+1 \u0000 puj\u00001+i \u0015 (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n:\nIf IECj is not de\fned for some j or if #IECj\u00001 < m+ 1 then we set IECr = ? for r \u0015 j.\nThe following steps show the process of identi\fcation of the IEC sets:\n1. Draw a real segment starting from p1 and ending with pn.\n2. Starting from the left, draw a circle encompassing as many players as possible and at\nmost m + 1 players such that the last player in the circle, i, is such that pi+1 \u0000 pi >\n(1 \u0000 \u000e)x\nc\n. If no such circle exists or if the circle encompasses fewer than m + 1 player\nstop.\n3. Otherwise, remove all players in the circle and go to step 2.\nEach circle drawn in the fashion explained above represents an IEC. We illustrate the\nconstruction of the IEC sets with the following example:\nExample 1. Assume a population of n = 10 players withm = 2, p10 < \u000e\nx\nc\n, pi+1\u0000pi > (1\u0000\u000e)\nx\nc\nfor i \u0014 8 and p10 \u0000 p9 < (1 \u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n. In this case, each player i \u0014 8 is not too similar to his\nneighbors i\u0000 1 and i+1 while players 9 and 10 are similar. Following step 1, we draw a real\nsegment starting from p1 and ending with p10.\n9\nNext, we draw a circle encompassing players 1, 2 and 3 (the circle cannot encompass more\nthan m + 1 players). Dropping players 1-3 and repeating the same steps, we draw a circle\nencompassing players 4-6.\nGiven that p10 \u0000 p9 < (1 \u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n, the next circle only encompasses players 7 and 8. Fur-\nthermore, no more circles are to be drawn as this last circle encompasses a number of players\nbelow m+ 1. Figure 1 shows the real segment and the di\u000berent circles.\nFigure 1: Finding the IEC\nTherefore, in this case we can see that IEC1 = f1; 2; 3g , IEC2 = f4; 5; 6g and IEC3 =\nf7; 8g.\nThe usefulness of identifying the IEC sets lies in the fact that no player belonging to\nIECj for any j has an incentive to break a friendship relation with any other player in\nIECj in order to set up a relation with a player not in IECj . This is because in a pairwise\nequilibrium where no betrayals occurred in the past the number of players in any IEC is at\nmost m+1. Furthermore, all players in a IEC have friendship relations with all other players\nin the same IEC. The next proposition relates the IEC sets with the friendship relations\nthat can arise in the long-run. By long-run we mean a situation where t is su\u000eciently large.\nThis is needed to ensure that any possible betrayals between players belonging to the same\nIEC are forgiven.\nProposition 2. In all pairwise equilibria in the long-run every player i 2 IECj is friends\nwith all other players k 2 IECj r i for all j .\nProof. The proof is by induction on the IEC sets. If IEC1 encompasses only one player, the\nresult in the proposition follows. Suppose then that IEC1 encompasses at least two players.\nAssume that no betrayals occurred in the past between any two players in IEC1. If two\nplayers i and k belonging to IEC1 are not friends and both have fewer than m friends, then\nthey can increase their payo\u000b by switching to play the Cooperative Plan with each other. If\n10\ni and k are not friends and at least one of them, say i, has m friends, then i must be friends\nwith a player outside IEC1 as IEC1 encompasses at most m + 1 players. But if this is the\ncase, i will \fnd it optimal to betray her friend who needs help the most to become friends\nwith k, recall that IEC1 encompasses the m + 1 players who need help the least. Finally,\nif one of the players in IEC1, say i, has m friends, he might consider betraying a friend in\nIEC1 to become friends with a player outside IEC1. This will carry a one period increase\nin payo\u000b that might o\u000bset the loss of being friends with a player who needs more help. This,\nhowever, does not happen as pg \u0000 pk > (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\nfor any g outside IEC1 and any k belonging\nto IEC1.\nThus, if no betrayals occurred in the past between players in IEC1 then every player in\nIEC1 must be friends with every other player in IEC1.\nAssume that a betrayal between two players belonging to IEC1 occurred in the past.\nWith probability \" > 0 this betrayal is forgiven and we are back to the case considered\nabove. Since forgiveness occurs with a probability bounded away from zero, if t is large\nenough the probability that a betrayal is forgiven is arbitrarily close to one.\nRecursively, take any set IECj with j > 1. All players in IECs with s < j are friends\nin the long-run when t is big and all sets IECs encompass exactly m + 1 players. Again,\nif IECj encompasses fewer than two players or if it is empty the result in the proposition\nfollows. Consider then that IECj encompasses at least two players. Following the same logic\nas before, all players in IECj are friends in the long-run.\nCorollary 1. Assume that there are j \u0015 3 non-empty IEC. For any \u0016 > 0 there exists a \u0016t\nsuch that for all t > \u0016t the probability that a player i belonging to IECl with l < j is friends\nwith a player not in IECl is smaller than \u0016.\nA further de\fnition shows very helpful in the characterization of pairwise equilibria in\nthe long-run.\nDe\fnition 5. Consider the reduced population M1 = N r[rIECr. Let v0 = #[r IECr. If\n#M1 \u0014 m then de\fne the First Mixed Equilibrium Component (MEC1) as MEC1 =\nfj 2 M1 : pj < \u000ex=cg. Otherwise, de\fne MEC1 has the set of players fv0 + 1; : : : ; v0 +\nm; : : : ; v0 + ig 2 M1 where i is the maximum natural number i \u0015 m such that\npv0+i <\n\u000ex\nc\n;\npv0+i+1 \u0000 pv1+i \u0015 (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\nif player v0 + i+ 1 exists\nand, for all k 2 fv0 +m; : : : ; v0 + i\u0000 1g\npv0+k+1 \u0000 pv0+k < (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n:\n11\nRecursively, consider the reduced population Mj = N r [rIECr r [s<jMECs. Let vj\u00001 =\n#[rIECr+#[s\u0014j\u00001MECs and de\fne the j-th Mixed Equilibrium Component (MECj)\nas the set of players fvj\u00001 + 1; : : : ; vj\u00001 +m; : : : ; vj\u00001 + ig 2 Mj where i is the maximum\nnatural number i \u0015 m such that\npvj\u00001+i <\n\u000ex\nc\n;\npvj\u00001+i+1 \u0000 pvj\u00001+i \u0015 (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\nif player i+ 1 exists\nand, for all k 2 fm; : : : ; i\u0000 1g\npvj\u00001+k+1 \u0000 pvj\u00001+k < (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n:\nIf MECj is not de\fned for some j, then we set MECr = ? for r \u0015 j.\nFinding the MEC for a given population can be done in the following fashion:\n1. Drop all players belonging to an IEC.\n2. Draw a real segment starting from the smallest p and ending with pn.\n3. Starting from the left, draw a circle encompassing the \frst m players plus all players\nfrom the m + 1-th to the i-th such that pi+1 \u0000 pi > (1 \u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\nand for all player k > m\ninside the circle pk+1 \u0000 pk < (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n. If no such circle exists, stop.\n4. Otherwise, remove all players in the circle and go to step 2.\nWe can illustrate the steps above with an example.\nExample 2. Assume a population of n = 4 players with m = 1, p4 < \u000e\nx\nc\n, p3\u0000 p1 < (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\nand p4 \u0000 p3 > (1 \u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n. In this case, no player belongs to a IEC. Proceeding as in steps\n1-4 above, a \frst circle encompasses players 1, 2 and 3 while a second one encompasses only\nplayer 4. Thus, MEC1 = f1; 2; 4g and MEC2 = f4g (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Finding the MEC\nThe use of the de\fnition of the MEC set is illustrated in the following result.\n12\nProposition 3. Let IEC = fmaxj IECj such that IECj 6= ?g and consider a pairwise\nequilibrium in the long-run. Players in MEC1 can only be friends with players in IEC,\nMEC1 and MEC2. Players in MECj can only be friends with players in MECj\u00001, MECj\nand MECj+1 for all j \u0015 2.\nProof. Again we proceed by induction on theMEC sets. Assume no betrayals have occurred.\nSuppose \frst that the set IEC = fmaxj IECj such that IECj 6= ?g encompasses exactly\nm+ 1 so that by Proposition 2 all players belonging to a set IEC have exactly m friends in\nthe same set.\nIf in a pairwise equilibrium a player i 2 MEC1 is friends with a player k 2 MECj with\nj > 2 then there must be at least one player l 2 MECs with 1 \u0014 s < j that has m friends\nand is friends with a player in MECr with r > 1. Thus, if i becomes friends l then both\nincrease their payo\u000bs. A contradiction to the pairwise equilibrium condition.\nNext, we need to show that if a player i 2MEC1 has all his friends inMEC1 andMEC2,\nthen he has no incentive to break one of her friendship relations to set up a new one with a\nplayer in MECj with j > 2. Using the de\fnition of the MEC sets, for any k 2 MEC2 and\nany g 2 MECj with j > 2, we have that pg \u0000 pk > (1\u0000 \u000e)\nx\nc\n. Thus, the suggested deviation\nis never pro\ftable for player i.\nThe proof that players in MECj can only be friends with players in MECj\u00001, MECj\nand MECj+1 for all j \u0015 2 follows the same logic as before. If the set\nIEC = fmax\nj\nIECj such that IECj 6= ?g\nencompasses fewer than m+ 1 players, the proof again has the same logic as the one above.\nWe are left to show that the claim still holds if there have been betrayals in the past.\nWith probability \" > 0, a betrayal is forgiven. Thus, with positive probability all possible\nbetrayals are eventually forgiven and, therefore, the result follows.\nPropositions 2 and 3 allows us to conclude which friendship relations are possible in\nequilibrium and which ones are not. For example, assume that players are grouped into three\nIEC, one of them encompassing fewer than m+1 players, and three MEC. In this case the\npossible friendship relations in equilibrium are given in Figure 3. An arrow between two sets\nindicates that a player from one of the sets can be friends with a player from the other set.\nThe results from Propositions 2 and 3, illustrated in Figure 3, show how the segregation\nof friendships occurs. First, the population is partitioned into di\u000berent groups, IECs and\nMECs, according to the amount of help players need. Players belonging to the \frsts IEC\nonly become friends with players within their same group; complete segregation and exclusion\n13\nFigure 3: Friendship relations between and within IEC and MEC\noccurs. Players belonging to the last IEC and to the MECs segregate in a less extreme\nway. These players can be friends in the long-run with players within their same group\nand with players from the two groups adjacent to theirs. The role of similarity in the way\nthe segregation occurs is clear. Note, however, that no assumption on a taste for similarity\nwas made; a taste for similarity appears as a result of the model rather than as a built-in\nassumption.\n4 Dynamics\nIn the previous section we characterized the pairwise equilibria in the long-run. However, the\nquestion of how each speci\fc path or history occurred was not explored. In this section, we\nsuggest how friendship relations can emerge in the real world.\nAssume that at the beginning of time, t = 0, players are unaware of the existence of other\nplayers. At this stage, each player believes she is alone in the world. Each period t \u0015 1, two\nplayers are randomly drawn from the population and they meet. Once this has happened,\nthey start playing the Helping Game. If two players i and k are unaware of each other at\ntime t, then we set hsik = ?.\nAt each point in time the two players who are randomly drawn jointly take the myopic\nbest response to the current history and con\fguration of strategies. That is, if the players\nselected are i and k, then for given Ht and (Stj)j2Nrfi;kg players i and k choose S\nt\ni and S\nt\nk\nsuch that\n\u0019ti\n\u0000\nHt;\n\u0000\n(Stj)j2Nrfi;kg; S\nt\ni ; S\nt\nk\n\u0001\u0001\n> \u0019ti\n\u0010\nHt;\n\u0010\n(Stj)j2Nrfi;kg; S^\nt\ni ; S^\nt\nk\n\u0011\u0011\n;\n\u0019tk\n\u0000\nHt;\n\u0000\n(Stj)j2Nrfi;kg; S\nt\ni ; S\nt\nk\n\u0001\u0001\n> \u0019tk\n\u0010\nHt;\n\u0010\n(Stj)j2Nfi;kg ; S^\nt\ni ; S^\nt\nk\n\u0011\u0011\nfor all S^ti and S^\nt\nk. If the best response is not uniquely de\fned, players randomize with full\nsupport over all possible alternatives.\nThe assumption that players are myopic is a bound to the rationality of players that\nallows for betrayals to occur in the population.\nEvidently, the characterization of the pairwise equilibria in the long-run presented in the\nprevious section is still valid here. The dynamic setting just presented allows us to illustrate\n14\none possible way of how the friendship network may come to emerge. In the remainder of\nthe section, we present two simulations.\n4.1 Simulation 1\nIn this example, we have m = 2 and n = 8 with p8 < \u000ex=c, p4 \u0000 p3 > (1 \u0000 \u000e)x=c and\np7 \u0000 p6 > (1\u0000 \u000e)x=c. Therefore, players 1\u0000 3 are somewhat similar to each other, but none\nof them is similar to player 4. Similarly, players 4\u0000 6 are similar to each other, but none of\nthem is similar to player 7.\nIn this situation, players 1\u0000 3, 4\u0000 6 and 7\u0000 8 form IEC1, IEC2 and IEC3 respectively.\nTherefore, by Corollary 1, in the long-run, each player is friends with players belonging to\nthe same IEC as the one she belongs to.\nThe evolution of the population in this case is given in Figures 4-6. In these \fgures, the\nstate of the population is presented after t = 5; 30; 100 periods respectively. The speci\fc\nvalues of the parameters used are x = 0:6, c = 0:6, \u000e = 0:72, \" = 0:25. In Figures 4-8 each\nnode represents a player, while an arrow linking two nodes represents the fact that these two\nplayers are friends.\nFigure 4: Simulation 1, t = 5\nAs we see from Figure 4, after the \frst \fve periods, players are just starting to meet each\nother. As each player knows very few people, the constraint of at most m friends has no\ne\u000bect. At this stage all friendship relations are possible.\nAfter the \frst 30 periods, Figure 5, there are still players who are not aware of each other.\nFor instance, it is incentive compatible for player 3 to be friends with both 1 and 2. However,\n15\nFigure 5: Simulation 1, t = 30\nthis has not happened yet as neither player 1 nor player 2 has met with player 3.\nFigure 6: Simulation 1, t = 100\nAfter 100 periods, all players are aware of each other. The unique long-run pairwise\nequilibrium has been reached.\n4.2 Simulation 2\nWe now consider a more intricate case. As before m = 2 and n = 9. Furthermore, p9 < \u000ex=c,\np3 \u0000 p2 > (1\u0000 \u000e)x=c and p6 \u0000 p5 > (1\u0000 \u000e)x=c.\nUsing the de\fnitions of IEC and MEC, we can group players in the following way:\nIEC1 = f1; 2g, MEC1 = f3; 4; 5g and MEC2 = f7; 8; 9g. Therefore, by Propositions 2 and 3\nthe friendship relations that we do not observe in the long-run are between a player in IEC\nand a player in MEC2. Furthermore, the only friendship relation that is present for certain\nin the long-run involves players 1 and 2.\n16\nFigure 7 presents the evolution of the population during the \frst \fve periods. As with\nSimulation 1, at this stage, players start to meet each other and given that p9 < \u000ex=c all\nfriendship relations are possible.\nFigure 7: Simulation 2, t = 5\nAfter 150 periods, Figure 8, all players are aware of each other. However, given the simi-\nlarity between players, betrayals, forgivingness and new friendship are constantly occurring.\nGiven our static analysis we know that the only friendship relations that will not be observed\nare between a player in IEC and a player in MEC2 while the only friendship relation that\nis present for certain involves players 1 and 2.\nFigure 8: Simulation 2, t = 150\nGiven that in the current simulation the population never stabilizes, Table 2 gives the\nfrequency of periods in which any two players are friends in a t = 50; 000 period simulation.\n17\nAs we see, players 3 \u0000 4 are completely exchangeable for players 1 and 2. Similarly, players\n6\u0000 9 are completely exchangeable for players 3\u0000 5; the role of similarity is clear once again.\nTable 2: Simulation 2, t = 50,000\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n1 \u0000 0:9994 0:3298 0:3371 0:3325 0 0 0:0003 0:0005\n2 0:9994 \u0000 0:3442 0:3370 0:3189 0:0001 0 0:0001 0\n3 0:3298 0:3442 \u0000 0:2478 0:2359 0:1577 0:1351 0:1129 0:1138\n4 0:3371 0:337 0:2478 \u0000 0:2407 0:1573 0:1343 0:1137 0:0983\n5 0:3325 0:3189 0:2359 0:2407 \u0000 0:1615 0:1357 0:1228 0:1175\n6 0 0:0001 0:1577 0:1573 0:1615 \u0000 0:3525 0:2952 0:2468\n7 0 0 0:1351 0:1343 0:1357 0:3525 \u0000 0:2561 0:2397\n8 0:0003 0:0001 0:1129 0:1137 0:1228 0:2952 0:2561 \u0000 0:2256\n9 0:0005 0 0:1138 0:0983 0:1175 0:2468 0:2397 0:2256 \u0000\nThe reason why we observe some positive frequency of friendship between players 1 or 2\nand 8 or 9; is that during the \frst few periods, players are not yet aware of the existence of\nall the other players. This is also the reason why the frequency of friendship between players\n1 and 2 is not exactly one; during the \frst periods, players 1 and 2 simply do not know each\nother.\nAn alternative dynamic setting could be that players are more likely to meet friends of\nfriends than to meet any other player (as in Currarini et al (2009)). Similarly, one could\nassume that players have \fxed locations in a lattice and, hence, each player is more likely\nto meet her neighbors than any other player. Alternative versions of the dynamics produce\ndi\u000berent short-run results. Our long-run results (Propositions 2 and 3) are robust to all these\nspeci\fcations as they do not depend on the speci\fc process by which players meet, or by\nwhich players are allowed to update their strategies.\nFor the simulations presented in this section, we have assumed that players have a certain\ndegree of myopia, i.e. players do not take into account that they can meet new players. This\nassumption is innocuous for the results in Section 3.\n18\n5 Empirical Facts and Extensions\n5.1 Relating our Results with Empirical Facts About Friendship\nIn this paper we proposed a repeated setting in which players are friends when they are helping\neach other. Many empirical studies show the importance of the exchange of help between\nfriends. For example, Walker (1995) interviewed 52 working- and middle-class subjects and\nfound that one of the main functions of the friends was to provide help. She found that among\nthe working-class, this help was based on providing goods and services such as borrowing or\nlending small amounts of money or o\u000bering help in \fnding a job. In turn, helping among the\nmiddle-class was based on emotional and intellectual support.\nIn their study of 185 Dutch students, Buunk and Prins (1998) found that in the relation-\nship with their best friend, 73.6% of the subjects considered the friendship to be reciprocal.\nIn our paper, players' reciprocity is translated into Grim Trigger: I help you as long as you\nhelp me. The Cooperative Plan is restrictive as it does not allow for forgiveness, but forgive-\nness is a standard feature of friendship. We believe that using Grim Trigger is not so far from\nreality as betraying a friend is something very severe that is di\u000ecult to forgive. Betraying\na friend causes direct and conscious harm, which is di\u000berent to, for instance, having a small\ndisagreement with a friend. Nevertheless, we allow for forgiveness by assuming that each\nperiod a betrayal that occurred in the past is forgiven with a small probability \".\nAs shown in Section 4, the friendship relations present in the population at a given point\nin time can depend on the order in which players meet. The fact that the order in which\npeople meet a\u000bects the long-term friendship relations was reported in an empirical study\nby Cloninger (1986). Cloninger found that meeting new people may result in breaking old\nand strong friendship relations because of the novelty of having new friends. Whitmeyer and\nYeingst (2006) refer to this characteristic of the friendship relations as \fckleness.\n5.2 Extensions\nIn the model presented in the main text, if a player betrays another the remaining players do\nnot react. We may think that if a player betrays her friends, it is less likely that other players\nwill want to become friends with her. Consider now a situation where if a player betrays\nanother, all players automatically switch to play the Defective Plan against the betrayer.\nEach player knows this fact when considering whether to betray one of her friends or not.\nWe call this punishment mechanism the Social Punishment.\nUnder Social Punishment the cost of betraying is higher than in the absence of the punish-\nment mechanism. Thus, friendship relations that were not stable before may endure the test\n19\nof time, as in the event of a betrayal the betrayer loses all her friends. Breaking a friendship\nrelation yields bene\ft x in the present period and a loss of all future payo\u000b (until forgiveness\noccurs). Thus, with Social Punishment, once a friendship relation has been established, it is\nnever broken. This fact is rather unrealistic and occurs as a result of the implicit assumption\nthat there is no way a player can break a friendship relation without having all the society\npunishing her. If we allowed players to commonly agree on ending friendship relations with-\nout defection, then the long-run results are the same as the ones achieved in Section 3. The\nonly di\u000berence is that in this case the dynamics change when compared to those in Section\n4.\nThe role of the discount factor for determining the pairwise equilibria is clear (see the\nde\fnitions of IEC and MEC). A question that might arise is, then, what discount factor\nmaximizes the sum of the discounted stream of payo\u000bs in the population? That is, is a\nmore patient population likely to achieve higher payo\u000b than an impatient one? With a high\ndiscount factor (\u000e close to one), in all pairwise equilibria all players have friendship relations\nwith their m most similar players. On the other hand, a small discount factor makes helping\nharder to sustain as well as making betraying more pro\ftable. Thus, higher discount factors\nyield a higher sum of the discounted stream of payo\u000bs. That is, there is a positive relation\nbetween the patience and the payo\u000b of the population.\n6 Conclusions\nWe have presented a model of friendship selection between a group of players. Each player\ncan decide with whom she wants to become friends. The results of the paper state conditions\nunder which friendship relations can arise between players. We \fnd that, without assuming\nany taste for similarity, the more di\u000berent two players are, the less likely they are to become\nfriends. Furthermore, we characterized the long-run friendship networks and concluded by\nillustrating the simple dynamics of how a friendship network forms.\nThe model presented here di\u000bers mainly from the existing models in psychology, anthro-\npology and sociology in that it is solved analytically and makes no assumptions in the taste\nfor friends. Moreover, it di\u000bers from the existing models of social networks in that there\nexists heterogeneity between players and the strategies of each player can be di\u000berent in each\none of the cooperative games that they play on each period.\nThe paper gives a precise non-trivial explanation to some of the phenomena we \fnd in\nfriendship relations among humans.\n20\nReferences\n[1] Axelrod, R.
