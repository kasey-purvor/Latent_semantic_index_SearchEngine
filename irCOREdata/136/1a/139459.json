Photothermal (PT) and\nphotoacoustic (PA) detection methods are therefore of interest because of their relative resistance to light\nscattering within the sample compared with conventional transmission spectrometers[1,2]. Typically, recent\nwork on these techniques has involved the use of high power cw or pulsed lasers to give increased signal\nlevels. Time resolution has enabled separation of the absorption and scattering related contributions to a\n2photoacoustic signal[3]. However, these systems are complex and the pulsed lasers they require are not\nalways available at appropriate wavelengths at an acceptable cost.\nOur approach has been to increase the sensitivity of a closed PT cell, such that signal levels are acceptable,\neven for low power, cw light sources such as laser diodes, UV discharge lamps and LEDs. A water\nmeniscus has been used as a highly compliant pressure sensor at the top of a closed cell[4], with vertical\nmovement of the centre of the meniscus detected using fibre optic interferometry.\nThere are relatively few reports that quantitatively compare the results of PA \/ PT detectors with more\nconventional methods of measuring optical absorption. Helander et al have investigated the effects of very\nhigh levels of light scattering internal to the sample[5], while McClelland and Knisely have discussed the\neffects of scattering from the sample to the cell wall[6], but without making any measurements on explicitly\nscattering bulk samples. Light scattering is expected to increase the measurement uncertainty for\nphotothermal deflection spectroscopy and thermal lens spectroscopy, through a more spatially diffuse or\nattenuated measurement beam[7], though perhaps with better immunity to scattering than straightforward\nmeasurement of the transmitted light intensity[8].\nWe have now evaluated our detector with highly scattering water samples, whose turbidities spanned the\nrange typically observed at water treatment intakes. The results were related to absorption coefficients using\na coloured compound (potassium permanganate, KMnO4) in aqueous solution. Our system has previously\nbeen demonstrated using a range of other wavelengths across the visible region[9]. To evaluate scattering\neffects we concentrated on our available wavelength extrema and compared performance to that of a\ncommercial diode array spectrometer at 254nm and 678nm.\nWe further modified the cell, changing it from a transmission geometry to an integrating cavity. Integrating\nspheres have been previously used to make absorption measurements with good results[10,11], but there has\nbeen little work to combine the technique with PA methods[12]. The level of spurious signals resulting from\nside-wall absorption, in the manner of window noise[1], was uncertain.\n32 Principle of operation\nThe photothermal system employed a flat water meniscus, constrained by surface forces, at a small (200 \u00b5m\ndiameter) circular pinhole in nickel foil. Photothermal absorption of modulated light resulted in periodic\npressure changes in the cell, which caused the meniscus to be deflected like a thin diaphragm, its curvature\ndetermined by the excess pressure in the cell. Zero dc pressure difference across the meniscus was\nmaintained by a slow hydraulic leak to an outside reservoir, which equalised internal and external pressures\non a timescale much longer than the modulation period in photothermal experiments. A schematic diagram\nof the apparatus is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Schematic diagram of photothermal detector.\n3 Theory of operation\nThe absorbed intensity I of a sample with an absorption coefficient \uf061 (in cm-1) and optical pathlength L (in\ncm) is given by Beer\u2019s law. For turbid solutions, the additional use of a scattering coefficient s (in cm-1) is\nwell established[13], as follows;\nwhere Io is the incident intensity. \uf061 and s are additive and may depend on wavelength.\n\uf07b \uf07dLsII )(1010 \uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d \uf061 (1)\n4For low frequency PT signal generation, we assume that all the absorbed light is instantly converted to heat.\nThe deflection of the centre of the meniscus, \uf044h, has been shown to obey the following relationship[4].\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf0b6\n\uf044\uf0b6\n\uf067\n\uf070\n\uf063\n\uf067\uf072\n\uf062\n8\n1\n4 4\n2\naVC\na=\nE\nh\ncp\n(2)\nE is the light energy absorbed by the fluid, \uf062 is the volume thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid, Cp is\nits specific heat capacity, \uf072 is its density, \uf067 is its surface tension, \uf063 is its bulk modulus, a is the radius of the\nmeniscus (200\uf06dm), and Vc is the volume of fluid enclosed by the cell (1.6\uf0b410-5 m3).\nThe use of low-finesse optical fibre interferometers for the measurement of small deflections is well\nestablished. The cleaved end of the interferometer fibre and the centre of the water meniscus together\nformed a low finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. Santos et al have analysed a similar cavity[14], and confirmed that\nfor small reflectivities, an approximation to a two beam or Fizeau interferometer can be made, with\nmultiple reflections at a low level. The interference fringes are then approximated by the following:\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf06c\n\uf070\n\uf066\uf066\nd\nA\n4\ncos0 (3)\n\uf066 is the voltage signal from the detector (proportional to the detected fringe intensity), d is the distance\nseparating the fibre end and the meniscus, \uf06c is the interferometer wavelength, and A is a scale factor which\nis to be determined. At phase quadrature, the possible scale error resulting from the presence of multiple\nreflections is negligible[14] and the meniscus deflection may be calculated using the equation;\nA\nd\n\uf070\n\uf06c\n\uf064\uf066\uf064\n4\n= (4)\nSelf-referencing techniques have been used to improve the repeatability of the PT measurements[15]. These\nmethods corrected for changes in the responsivity of the system, mainly due to interference fringe drift, (a\nchange in the value of the scale factor A in equation (4)). A standard volumetric modulation was applied to\nthe PT cell using a piezoelectric transducer (\u201ccell PZT\u201d in Figure 2), at a different frequency from the PT-\nexcited signal. We took the ratio of (i) the photothermal signal from the analyte, to (ii) the self-referencing\nsignal and converted this to a meniscus displacement \uf044h in nm, using the following calibration factor for an\napplied voltage of 9.48mVrms across the cell PZT;\n5Following self referencing, it was estimated that the residual level of scale error on measured PT signals\nwas up to \u00b19%, the precise error being dependent on environmental factors such as temperature stability.\n4 Experimental details\nFigure 2 shows the experimental apparatus, which has already been described in detail[4]. The entire\napparatus was enclosed within an acoustic isolation chamber. The stainless steel PT cell had a pathlength of\n5 cm and an internal diameter of 20 mm, with a highly polished inner surface. Sapphire windows were used\nfor easy cleaning, and to minimise any possible PT window noise[1].\nFigure 2. Experimental configuration for photothermal detection.\nTwo light sources were used for PT excitation experiments, chosen for their simplicity, low cost and high\navailability. The first source was a red laser diode module (RS 194-004) which could be square-wave\nmodulated at frequencies above 100Hz. The second was a mercury discharge lamp (Spectronics Spectroline\n11SC-1), driven via its proprietary driver (Spectroline SCT 1A\/F), which was designed to run from a mains\ninput. Variable frequency operation was achieved by connecting the signal generator output to a power\namplifier (ILP SMOS 248), and using a transformer (RS 578-430) to provide the 240V required by the\nlamp driver. The lamp intensity was modulated as a rectified sine wave, the majority of the modulation\n\uf028 \uf029\nsignalPZT\nsignalPT\nnm07.078.0 \uf0b1\uf03d\uf044h (5)\nmonomode\noptical fibre\nref\ninterferometer\ndemodulationlight\nsource\nmeniscus\nPZT\nbimorph\nacoustic chamber\nsignal\ngenerator\nphase\ncontroller\nlight source\ndriver in\nref out signal\ngenerator\ncell PZT oscilloscope\nlock-in\namplifier\nlock-in\namplifier\nin\n6occurring at 2f. Stray light was reduced by covering the mercury tube with aluminium foil, apart from a\n3mm hole from which light was coupled into the cell using a high NA lens.\nEach light source was modulated at a frequency of 115Hz (=2f for the UV lamp). Using a calibrated\nphotodiode, the modulated laser diode emission was estimated to be 1.4mWrms at 678nm, and the UV\nlamp output 0.3mWrms at 254nm, the emission wavelengths being confirmed by a diode array\nspectrometer (HP 8452A). The signal applied to the cell PZT, for self-referencing purposes, was\n9.48mVrms at 90Hz. Cross-talk was confirmed to be negligible between the simultaneous signals from the\nPZT and those generated by either of the light sources.\nThe light sources were each driven by a Thurlby Thandar TG220 signal generator, and photothermal\nsignals detected with an EG+G 5210 lock-in amplifier. The second lock-in amplifier was an EG+G 5110,\nwhich differed from the first only in its upper frequency limit. It drove the cell PZT though its internal\nsignal generator, and detected the volumetric self-reference signal. Both lock-ins employed 100s integration\nperiods. The cell PZT (Morgan Matroc PZT-5A) was a 0.45mm thick, 10mm square wafer, with electrodes\non the two opposing faces, bonded to cover a 6mm diameter hole in the cell wall.\nThe optical fibre interferometer was used at phase quadrature, which was maintained by moving the end of\nthe interferometer fibre with a piezoelectric bimorph element (RS 285-784), in a slow control loop with a\ntime constant of approximately 0.2s. The distance between the cleaved optical fibre end and the centre of\nthe meniscus was approximately 60-100 \u00b5m, which was much shorter than the coherence length of the\n780nm laser diode used in the interferometer. This interferometer was then used to measure an rms noise\nfloor for the meniscus displacement of 10 pm Hz-1\/2. Thus, with a 100s time constant, it was expected that\ndeflections of 1pm would have a signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 1.\n4.1 Preparation of samples\nExperiments were performed on a range of concentrations of potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and a\nrange of suspensions of silica powder, both in deionised (DI) water. DI water was obtained from an\nElgastat Option 4 deioniser[16] (stated to have specific resistance > 5 M\uf057 cm at 25\uf0b0C, absorption by\ncontaminants < 0.001AU at 254nm, 0.2 \uf06dm filtration used against particulates).\n7KMnO4 is known to be a good standard for use as a photothermal absorber[17], because it doesn't fluoresce\nwhen excited in the visible, and delivers heat quickly to the solvent. Samples were made up by successive\ndilution from a stock solution containing a known quantity of the solid. No more than three serial dilutions\nwere used, making the maximum estimated uncertainty in concentration less than 4% for the weakest\nsolutions. KMnO4 is known to be unstable in the presence of reducing agents. The sample absorptions were\ntherefore checked before and after the experimental run and found to be stable to within the limits of the\nspectrometer, or to within \u00b13%, whichever was the higher.\nFused silica powder was used to create turbid solutions because of the known low level of optical\nabsorption of pure silica at the wavelengths of interest, such that in the small quantities used here in water\n(3 \u2013 500 ppm by weight) its effect on the background absorption would be negligible. The powder (P&R\nlaboratories, ZZZ092018) had a quoted mean particle size of 3\uf06dm (information on its particle size\ndistribution was not available). This mean size lies between that of the turbidity standard formazin (~6\u00b5m)\nand the submicron standards based on polymer spheres[18]. The turbidity of the suspensions in NTU\n(nephelometric turbidity units) was measured using a commercial turbidimeter (Hach 2100AN, filter no.\n30312-00). The powder was observed to settle out over long time periods, so the containers were agitated to\ndisperse the solid before samples were removed. Care was taken to take all comparative measurements\n(turbidimeter, spectrometer and photothermal detector) after the same length of subsequent settlement time\n(10-15 minutes). Any remaining settlement error was estimated to be below the specified accuracy of the\ninstruments (\u00b15% for the turbidimeter).\n4.2 Experimental procedure\nPT measurements were made as follows. The cell was rinsed with the solution to be tested, and then filled\ncarefully, so as not to incorporate air bubbles. The interferometer fibre was roughly aligned to the centre of\nthe meniscus, by eye, using an xyz stage. A sinusoidal voltage of approximately 10V peak-to-peak was\napplied to the cell PZT in order to modulate the height of the centre of the meniscus. The resulting fringes\nfrom the interferometer were displayed on an oscilloscope and used to align the fibre more precisely, to the\nposition of maximum meniscus movement and to determine the correct quadrature setpoint for the phase\ncontroller. Measurements of PT-excited signals and the cell PZT-applied signals were used to determine the\nrms PT meniscus deflection as described in section 3.\n8For each of the samples used in the PT detector, comparative measurements were made using a diode array\nspectrometer (Hewlett Packard HP 8452A) with a 4cm pathlength silica cell, against a DI water blank.\n5 Results\nThe absorption spectrum of a KMnO4 solution and the scattering spectrum of a powdered silica suspension\nare shown in Figure 3.\nab\nso\nrp\ntio\nn\nco\nef\nf\n(c\nm\n-1\n)\n0\n200\nKMnO4\n5 ppm\n(3\uf0b410-5M)\n300 400 500 600 700 800\n0.05\n0.1\nwavelength (nm)\n200 300 400 500 600 700 800\n0\n0.1\nsilica suspension\n35 ppm (3.5\uf0b410-3 wt%)\nsc\nat\nte\nrin\ng\nco\nef\nf\n(c\nm\n-1\n)\n0.2\nwavelength (nm)\nFigure 3.

The relationship between turbidity in NTU (measured with the turbidimeter) and the scattering\ncoefficient s (measured with the diode array spectrometer) is expected to be broadly linear, since both\n11\ntechniques use a similar optical method of measurement. Saturation can be seen at values of s approaching\n1 cm-1. At these high levels of turbidity, the \u201cfalse positive\u201d signal generated by the spectrometer is\nincreased from the underlying absorption of water, by a factor of up to 53 (limited by apparent saturation)\nat 254nm and a factor of up to 225 at 678nm.\n678nm\n1\n10\n100 103\n10-4\n10-3\n0.01\n0.1\n1\nturbidity (NTU)\nsc\nat\nte\nrin\ng\nco\nef\nfic\nie\nnt\ns\n(c\nm\n-1\n)\n254nm\n0.1 10 0.1 1 10 100 103\n0.02\n0.1\nturbidity (NTU)\nm\nen\nsi\ncu\ns\nde\nfle\nct\nio\nn\n(n\nm\n)\n0.03\n0.05\n678nm\n254nm\n0.01\n(a) (b)\nFigure 6.

The low volume fractions of silica present were expected to have a negligible effect on the\ntotal absorption of the suspension, so at both wavelengths any change in the signal level should be due to\nlight scattering alone.\nFigure 7 shows the false-positive absorption coefficient resulting from light scattering, estimated by\ncomparison with measurements made on deionised water controls. Figure 7(b) shows the improvement\nfactor for the PT cell compared to the spectrometer. Although the errors have been magnified in this plot,\nespecially at low levels of turbidity, it can be seen that the PT cell showed a significant improvement over\nthe spectrometer, by up to a factor of 60 for the most highly scattering samples.\n12\n(a) (b)\nFigure 7.

The results shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 can be compared with\nthose in Figure 5 for the non-integrating cell. The integrating cavity appears to have increased the\nresponsivity to KMnO4 at 678nm by a factor of approximately two, and to have improved the minimum\ndetectable absorption coefficient, both of which would be consistent with an increase in the effective\npathlength. Unfortunately at 254nm the cell showed no response to additional absorption by KMnO4,\nwhich suggests that absorption at the Macor cell wall may have given rise to large and dominant PT\nsignals. The fact that meniscus deflections at this wavelength were so much greater than those recorded for\nthe conventional PT cell is also consistent with this hypothesis.\n10-6 10-5 10-4 10-3 0.01 0.1 1\n678 nm\n1\nproportion of light\nabsorbed by KMnO4\nm\nen\nis\ncu\ns\nde\nfle\nct\nio\nn\n(n\nm\n)\nabsorption coefficient of\nKMnO4 (cm-1)\nm\nen\nis\ncu\ns\nde\nfle\nct\nio\nn\n(n\nm\n)\n0.1\nwater\n(1\u03c3)water\n(mean)\n(b)(a)\n0.3\n678 nm\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006\n-0.01\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nFigure 9.

Photothermal signals resulting from absorption of UV light by KMnO4 solutions, plotted on the\nsame scale as Figure 9 for comparison. The results indicate a complete lack of sensitivity to additional UV\nabsorption by KMnO4, for the integrating cell.\nBecause of this lack of response to absorption at 254nm, any tolerance to turbidity at this excitation\nwavelength is of little interest. However, it can be seen in Figure 11 that at 678nm the new integrating cell\nshowed remarkably little response to turbidity, any variation being at the level of measurement noise\nalready established. Figure 12 quantifies the level of improvement in comparison with the results of section\n5.2, showing minimal false positive absorption as a result of high turbidity, and improvement factors of up\nto 105 compared with a maximum factor of 45 observed previously at 678nm. (Since the false positive\nsignals here essentially appear to be dominated by measurement noise rather than by any systematic effects\nof turbidity, their use as the denominator in such a ratio is not helpful, however the values have been\nincluded here for completeness.)\n15\n0.1 1\n678 nm\n100 103\nturbidity (NTU)\nm\nen\nsi\ncu\ns\nde\nfle\nct\nio\nn\n(n\nm\n)\n10\n254 nm\n0.01\n0.03\n0.1\n0.3\n1\nFigure 11.

In contrast, the acceptance aperture of a PA or PT detector is effectively larger,\nin that it can accommodate changes in the trajectories of light without generating such a large error.\n16\nThe scattering coefficients recorded by the diode array spectrometer indicate that at the highest levels of\nturbidity in this study, the amount of incident light that passed right through the photothermal cell would\nhave been minimal. There were therefore three more likely alternative outcomes for each photon entering\nthe cell:\n(i) Absorption at the side-walls, which would add to the photothermal signal because some of the heat\ngenerated by side-wall absorption could be transferred back into the fluid and cause it to expand[6].\n(ii) Absorption by the fluid, with a potentially longer, convoluted pathlength[5].\n(iii) Back-scattering out of the cell, reducing the signal if the mean interaction distance for backscattered\nphotons were less than the length of the cell[5].\nWe can surmise that the change in PT signal due to effects (ii) and (iii) is likely to be small for the levels of\nscatter in our conventional PT cell. Any scattered rays having a significant additional, convoluted\npathlength would be highly likely to strike the cell sidewall, giving rise to larger signals as discussed below.\nThe potential for increased signals caused by absorption of the incident beam at the side-walls of an\nordinary transmission cell is considered greater for a long, thin cell, in which the scattered optical thickness\n(determined from Figure 6) is longer than the diameter of the cell. An estimate of the potential magnitude\nof this effect has been determined experimentally. The incident beams from the laser diode and the mercury\nlamp were directed straight towards the stainless steel side-wall, rather than through the centre of the cell,\nin a cell containing deionised water alone. The beams then exited the cell, having reflected once only, with\nan optical path length only 10% longer than would normally be the case. The resulting photothermal signals\nare summarised in Table 1, and compared to the measured signals from the most turbid silica suspension.\n17\nTable 1. RMS photothermal meniscus deflection for excitation in a highly turbid sample, and as a result of\nabsorption at the cell side-wall (uncertainties estimated from residual scale errors following self-\nreferencing)\nPhotothermal meniscus deflection\nExcitation\nwavelength deionised water\n(no scattering)\n610 NTU\nsample\nSide-wall absorption\nexperiment\n254nm 16\uf0b11.4 pm 33\uf0b13 pm 27\uf0b12 pm\n678nm 15\uf0b11.4 pm 92\uf0b18 pm 63 \uf0b16 pm\nThe results in Table 1 are of the same order of magnitude as our increased PT signals for turbid samples,\nsuggesting that side-wall absorption could be sufficient to account for the increase. Although the effects of\nlight scattering at 254nm are expected to be higher than those experienced at 678nm, Table 1 shows\nreduced absorption at the side-wall at 254nm, which could partially compensate.\nFor better resistance to light scattering, PT and PA cells that have a small aspect ratio (ie are short and fat)\nare likely to experience less side-wall absorption. Unfortunately, long, thin cells with a higher aspect ratio\ncan offer greater PA or PT sensitivity in the absence of scattering, since the shape of the cell can be more\nclosely matched to the shape of the light beam from well-collimated light sources, with a longer optical\npathlength and less dead volume of fluid[22]. Thus, even for a PA or PT detector, there can be a trade-off\nbetween measurement sensitivity and resistance to light scattering.\nThe use of Macor to create an integrating cavity in our later experiments had two possible outcomes, as\nexemplified by our results at 254nm and 678nm. Clearly, any light entering the cell would either be\nabsorbed by the fluid or the sidewall, or leave the cell via the entrance aperture. Having a small aperture\ncould therefore have resulted in little opportunity for backscattered light to escape, as in (iii). A relatively\nhigh level of sidewall absorption compared to the fluid might then preclude any sensitivity to absorption\nchanges within the fluid. At 254nm, we believe strong sidewall absorption and efficient heat transfer back\ninto the fluid resulted in signals that dominated any PT measurements of absorption within the fluid. The\nPT cell was as insensitive to turbidity as it was to any change in absorption within the analyte.\n18\nAt 678nm, an alternative outcome was observed, presumably because of much reduced levels of side-wall\nabsorption. We believe the high level of scattering by the cell wall itself now dominated the light\ndistribution, giving tolerance to light scattering that was at or below the measurement noise of <2\uf0b410-4cm-1.\nThe responsivity of the cell was increased and its minimum detectable absorption coefficient improved,\nboth consistent with a longer effective pathlength. This success may have been due to a favourable balance\nbetween a low level of sidewall absorption excited signals and an appropriately sized aperture, neither of\nwhich have been specifically optimised.\n7 Conclusion\nThe ability to detect trace contaminants in water, in the presence of turbidity, is of great importance. Our\nlow frequency photothermal detector, which employs low power light sources, has been tested using a\nrange of absorbing liquids and suspensions of light scatterers with turbidities in the range 0.3-600 NTU. A\nnovel integrating cavity PT cell was also created using Macor machinable ceramic, within the geometrical\nconfines of the original cell. A conventional diode array spectrometer was used for comparison.\nThe minimum detectable absorption coefficients of the PT detector and the spectrometer were similar.\nHowever, the PT technique was far less affected by light scattering than the spectrometer, giving false\npositive results that were reduced by up to a factor of 60 compared to the spectrometer. Turbidity is\nbelieved to increase the PT response by a possible combination of two mechanisms, (i) deflection of\nphotons towards the cell walls, where they may be absorbed and give rise to a spurious signal, and (ii)\nincreased average pathlengths. It was shown experimentally that the first effect could account for most, if\nnot all, the increased signals in our most turbid solutions in the PT transmission cell.\nA bigger improvement was observed in the integrating PT cell at 678nm, where responsivity was improved\nby a factor of two, the minimum detectable absorption coefficient was reduced, and the cell showed good\ntolerance to turbidity, at or below the measurement noise. However at 254nm the response was\nsubstantially degraded, probably caused by high levels of absorption by the sidewalls in the integrating cell.\nWe conclude that PT \/ PA detection and their combination with integrating cavities of appropriate\nreflectivity show good promise for the analysis of turbid media, the choice of technique depending on the\nlevels of turbidity and of sidewall absorption at the wavelengths of interest.\n19\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful for the support provided by North West Water Ltd and by the UK Department of\nTrade and Industry, through the Teaching Company Scheme.\nReferences\n1.
