It has evolved into a power-\nful tool for well informed decision-making within the cli-\nnician's daily practice. The challenge is to teach it\npractically in a clinical setting [1-4]. Unless trainees prac-\ntice EBM in everyday clinical work and observe their\nteachers practice EBM it will be difficult for EBM to\nachieve the status of core competency in medicine. To\ndevelop effective on-the-job training requires clinical\nteachers to develop the confidence to explicitly demon-\nstrate to trainees how their daily decisions about health-\ncare are based on the best available, current, valid and\nrelevant evidence [3]. For this, they need to move their\ntrainees forward from standalone courses, which may be\neffective in improving EBM knowledge, to clinically inte-\ngrate work-based teaching and learning that can bring\nabout changes in skills, attitudes and behaviour [5,6].\nHow can senior clinicians develop competence in teach-\ning integration of good quality research evidence into\nclinical practice?\nThrough our EU EBM Unity project we had successfully\ndevised a clinically integrated EBM e-learning course tar-\ngeting the learners of EBM [7,8]. The publication of this\nproject was \"Highly Accessed\" at Bio Med Central [7].\nOften the knowledge and skills attained by the EBM learn-\ners from courses like the above fell into decline due to lack\nof opportunities to continue EBM practice in their clinical\nenvironment. During the development of our EBM course\nfor learners, we became aware of the need to equip train-\ners with practical teaching skills to teach trainees the use\nof EBM in various clinical activities. There is a need to\ndevelop continuing professional development (CPD)\ncourses aimed at clinical teachers based on the sound\nprinciples of effective continuing education. No such\ncourses currently exist for teaching the trainers effective\nmethods for teaching and demonstrating integration of\nEBM to their trainees in a clinical setting. This background\nled us to develop a clinically integrated course for the\nteachers of EBM who supervise postgraduate medical train-\ning. This paper describes the process of curriculum devel-\nopment along with its current results.\nMethods\nFunded by the European Union (EU) through the Life-\nlong learning programme 2007 Leonardo da Vinci Trans-\nfer of innovation pilot project, we designed an e-learning\ncurriculum for CPD that would encourage participants\n(trainers) to learn practical and effective teaching meth-\nods for tutoring application of EBM in various clinical set-\ntings. The EU EBM TTT partnership involves a\ncollaboration of 10 partners within Europe and contrib-\nutes to harmonisation of EBM learning and teaching\nacross the European healthcare sector http:\/\/www.ebm-\nunity.org.\nWe developed the curriculum for teachers using sound\neducational principles for effective adult learning allow-\ning a maximum of flexibility and relevance to clinical\npractice [9-11]. A curriculum committee consisting of\nexperts in the field of EBM, clinical epidemiologists, clini-\ncians and educationalists from the participating countries\ncontributed to the work. Our methodology for the curric-\nulum design included identification of learning needs in\neach partner country, formulation of the aims, objectives\nand learning outcomes, development and organisation of\nthe content of the curriculum, development of the teach-\ning methods, definition of the educational strategy and\neducational environment, and delineation of an assess-\nment strategy.\nIn addition to our working group, an independent Euro-\npean Steering Committee provided input into the content,\neducational approach, applicability and sustainability,\ngiving advice at critical stages in the curriculum develop-\nment and thereby assured external validation and triangu-\nlation of the syllabus prepared.\nResults\nIdentification of learning needs of EBM trainers\nTo begin with we identified specific educational opportu-\nnities in various clinical settings that can be exploited byPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:59 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/59trainers to teach application of EBM. We took into\naccount the variation in clinical settings and teaching\nopportunities in different countries along with the varia-\ntion in the level of EBM knowledge amongst the trainers\nand trainees. This was done by an in-depth discussion\namong the project partners who had a good overview of\nthe ongoing activities in their countries, with input from\nthe external steering committee. We performed a survey to\nidentify the commonly perceived obstacles for teaching\nEBM in clinical practice. The feedback from trainers in our\nearlier work showed that there was a considerable\ndemand for up-skilling trainers [12]. The above process\nhelped to define feasible educational goals for the docu-\nmented learning needs of clinical trainers.\nFormulation of objectives and learning outcomes of \nteaching the EBM trainers course\nThe aim of the e-course was to provide trainers with prac-\ntical tips and methods by which EBM can be taught during\na range of clinical activities. The course had a large e-learn-\ning component providing practical demonstration of\ntechniques to teach EBM to clinical trainees [13]. E-learn-\ning sessions were designed to allow learning in the work-\nplace during short breaks within clinical activities, with\nthe option to interrupt and restart learning flexibly. The\nlearning objectives and outcomes were to help partici-\npants identify their trainees' knowledge gaps related to\ncurrent clinical practice and to use these to initiate EBM\nteaching (Appendix). This would allow them to teach the\ntrainees to follow the key steps of EBM in practice. They\nwould generate structured questions in an appropriate\nformat in any clinical setting e.g. during ward round, out-\npatient clinics, case discussion meeting, etc. Trainers\nshould be able to guide the trainees to search for relevant\nliterature, aiming for and identifying systematic reviews\nwherever possible by helping them choose the relevant\nsearch terms and directing them towards appropriate\ndatabases with input from a medical librarian if possible\n[14]. They should be able to teach the trainee to assess the\nquality (validity) of systematic reviews and the primary\nresearch included within them, emphasising that rather\nthan being a statistical exercise it is actually an exercise\ntowards bridging the gap between research and practice\n[15]. They should be able to demonstrate the applicability\nof the research findings to current clinical practice. Finally,\nthey should encourage the trainees to evaluate and even-\ntually adapt current practice in the light of newer evi-\ndences through clinically relevant activities like audit or\nquality assurance [16]. These key issues guided the devel-\nopment of the curriculum in six modules. Each module\nexploited learning and teaching opportunity presented at\nvarious clinical settings and provided practical tip to teach\nthe key steps of EBM.\nContent of modules\nThe curriculum was divided into six modules each of\nwhich presented approaches to exploit a learning oppor-\ntunity in formal and informal clinical settings for teaching\napplication of the five steps of EBM (Table 1). These clin-\nical settings were:\n1. Ward rounds: These are usually undertaken by a senior\nclinician with trainees, nurses and if feasible clinical\nlibrarian\n2. Journal club: It is a regular educational activity where\nthe clinician, often a trainee critically appraises a pub-\nlished piece of evidence obtained by systematic search of\nliterature to answer a clinical question\n3. Formal clinical meetings: Any meeting attended by the\ntrainer or trainee from one or more disciplines where the\nmanagement of individual cases are discussed\nTable 1: Learning opportunities for teaching evidence based medicine (EBM) in clinical practice\nEBM Steps\nLearning \nOpportunities\nFormulating \nQuestions\nSearching for \nEvidence\nCritical Appraisal Integrating Evidence \nwith Clinical \nscenario\nBringing Change to \nPractice\nWard Round +++ (+) + +++ +\nJournal Club + ++ +++ + +\nClinical Teaching And \nAssessment\n++ (+) ++ +++ +\nOutpatients Clinic +++ (+) ++ +++ +\nFormal Clinical \nMeeting\n+++ (+) + ++ +\nAudit ++ ++ ++ + +++\nEach clinical setting offers varying opportunities to teach application of the 5 EBM steps.\n(+) Opportunity may arise + Minimal opportunity\n++ Moderate opportunity +++ Maximum opportunityPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:59 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/594. Outpatient clinic: The management of patients on an\noutpatient basis by the trainer and trainee\n5. Audit meeting: It is a formal meeting usually held in a\nhospital where current clinical practice is compared to\npredetermined standards of care\n6. Formal clinical assessment: It is usually a one to one\nmeeting between the trainer and the trainee where the\ntrainer assesses the clinical knowledge and skills of the\ntrainee using validated assessment tools\nEach module outlined the basic prerequisite EBM compe-\ntencies to be acquired by participants to fulfil the qualifi-\ncation as EBM teachers. The clinical setting was described\ntaking into account the variation in practice and settings\nbetween healthcare systems in different countries. Where\nappropriate we have provided guidance for adaptation of\nthe teaching methods according to the existing resources\nand opportunities. Practical advice was provided on facil-\nitating teaching of the various EBM steps with videos dem-\nonstrating EBM teaching in action (Fig 1) [13]. Our e-\nlearning package from our previous project has been\nshown perform as well as face to face teaching [17,18].\nTeaching opportunities during clinical encounters were\ntaught through two modules focussing on ward rounds\nand outpatient clinics [14]. These two clinical settings are\nthe commonest available opportunities for interaction\nbetween the trainer and trainee. The first EBM step, ques-\ntion formulation, can easily be taught here. The module\nhelps the teacher to expose knowledge gaps in the trainee\nClinical tools to teach various steps of EBM in different clinical settingsFigure 1\nClinical tools to teach various steps of EBM in different clinical settings.\nAcquire \n(and appraise)\nevidence\nIntegrate\nevidence\ninto practice\nAppraise\nevidence\nManaging \nbringing change\nin practice\nWard rounds,\nClinics\nJournal club\nMorbidity\/mortality\nmeeting\nAudit\nClinical\nproblem\nExperience \nand expertise\nDecision \nmakingAuthoritative\npractice\nClinical\nproblem\nAsk answerable\nquestions\nApply evidence \nin decision\nmakingPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:59 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/59by asking questions relevant to the patient seen in the\nclinic or ward and framing them as focussed question\nusing the PICO format. It guides the trainer how to pre-\nscribe an educational prescription which can be quickly\nhanded to a trainee for them to follow it up when an\nopportunity arises during their busy schedule [19]. In\ninstitutions where there are facilities to perform immedi-\nate searches, a clinical librarian or another colleague can\ndemonstrate the ways in which trainees can search in\nappropriate databases using relevant search terms to\nobtain evidence.\nOpportunities to teach EBM during clinical meetings were\ncovered in three modules using Journal club, Morbidity\nand Mortality meetings, and Audit presentations\n[16,20,21]. These occasions engage trainees in communal\nEBM activity. These meetings offer the trainee the chance\nto prepare in advance before the event. The modules illus-\ntrate with the help of video demonstration and slides, the\nrole of the teacher in providing the trainee with informa-\ntion and material on the literature searching and critical\nappraisal steps of EBM. Journal clubs are ideal opportuni-\nties to teach in depth critical appraisal of papers presented\nwith help from easy to use software for EBM calculations\n[20,21]. At morbidity and mortality meetings, in addition\nto obtaining and appraising the relevant evidence, the\nways in which the applicability of that evidence to the care\nof the individual patient can also be illustrated. The use of\nAudit meetings in teaching the final step in EBM, bringing\nchange to clinical practice, can be demonstrated [16].\nClinical assessment of trainees are ideal opportunities for\nthe teacher to provide formative or summative assessment\nof EBM competence and for giving feedback on their per-\nformance [13,22]. These assessments are carried using dif-\nferent tools in different countries. The module also\nprovided examples of assessment tools used in different\nEuropean countries.\nAdministration of the course and learning method\nThe 6 module course had been developed for independ-\nent study. Participants will be supervising senior doctors\nwho act as moderators in the learning process of their\ntrainees. They will normally be competent practitioners\nwho will employ the tips from the e-learning modules to\nidentify teaching opportunities encountered in daily clin-\nical care for patients and by directing appropriate use of\nlearning resources in a clinical setting. The course can be\naccessed via the Internet from the website http:\/\/\nwww.ebm-unity.org, USB or CD-ROM. In addition to the\nabove methods, we aim to provide access through video\npodcasts and social websites like Face book. Furthermore\nit will enable busy clinicians to access the course both\ninside and outside the hospital, target a wider audience\nand promote dissemination. The e-modules integrate a\ncombination of teaching methods (Fig 2). They are devel-\noped to achieve self-directed, independent e-learning. At\nthe start of the course the participants are provided with\nthe overall aims and objectives of the curriculum, the\nnumber and title of modules each of which represent a\nclinical setting, an outline of the teaching, learning and\nassessment strategy, any relevant links or methodological\npapers and the time taken to complete each module. The\ncourse is developed to enable the participants to complete\nthe modules in 15 to 20 minutes. The e-learning package\nconsists of slides and written scripts; a talking head which\nAn overview of teaching and learning activities in the EU EBM Training the Trainers (TTT) course: Graphical representation of the EU-EBM TTT curriculumFigur  2\nAn overview of teaching and learning activities in the EU EBM Training the Trainers (TTT) course: Graphical \nrepresentation of the EU-EBM TTT curriculum.\n\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0006\u0007\u0003\b\t\n\u000b\f\t\n\r\u000e\u0003\b\u0007 \n\u000f\u0010\t\n\u0003\u0007\u0011\u0005\u0012\bPage 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:59 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/59covers the content of the scripts and guides the lecture;\nplay, pause and skip options; and hyperlinks to main sec-\ntions within the sessions. There is a short 3 minutes video\nclip of the practical demonstration of interaction between\nthe trainer and trainee in the different clinical settings.\nSessions can be accessed multiple times if necessary. The\nparticipants will apply the knowledge acquired from\nmodules into daily teaching of their trainees and will doc-\nument their progress. At the end of the modules the par-\nticipant will complete an assessment using multiple\nchoice questions that includes the content of the course.\nThe assignments will contribute to their personal develop-\nment plan.\nAssessment method\nOur systematic review of existing assessment tools has not\nidentified specific assessment tools for evaluating effec-\ntiveness of teaching the teachers courses in EBM[23] We\ntherefore developed and validated a questionnaire to\nassess the participants' performance before and after com-\npletion of the course. They will be assessed on their\nknowledge, skills and attitude using specific questions in\na multiple choice format. The course has been piloted in\n5 EU countries involving 60 participants. During the\npiloting we have collected feedback from the participants\non the content of course material, ease of access, clarity of\ninformation provided using semi structured qualitative\ninterviews. We have evaluated the technology acceptance\nusing a validated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)\nquestionnaire. The results of these will enable further\nimprovement of the course to suit the specific needs of\nparticipants.\nDiscussion\nThrough this EU project we have established an e-learning\ncourse targeting EBM teachers with emphasis on its pilot-\ning and promotion across the European healthcare sector\nand beyond.\nIt is well known that effective learning occurs when learn-\ners link theory with practice. This implies that learners are\nable to make connections between knowledge gained in\none scenario and apply it to another [24]. They are able to\nachieve this by identifying and exploiting the educational\nopportunities available in daily clinical practice learnt\nthrough the course to teach integration of EBM. This cur-\nriculum will help senior clinicians to make the best use of\navailable opportunities in everyday clinical situations to\nteach about the various steps of EBM and their application\nto practice, using the principles of adult learning. It will\ncontribute to their professional development and will\nimprove their educational environment.\nThe e-curriculum for trainers satisfies the CRISIS criteria\nfor successful CPD [10]. It is developed in such a way that\nit is Convenient (C) for the trainer to learn integration of\nEBM teaching in clinical practice by working through the\nmodules in a setting and time of their choice. To our\nknowledge at the moment such a curriculum aimed at this\ntarget population does not exist. By showing the teaching\nopportunities in various clinical settings encountered by\nany healthcare professional in day-to-day practice, it is\nhighly Relevant (R) to this group of individuals. The cur-\nriculum is Individualised (I) with flexibility to apply the\nprinciples of teaching in various clinical settings, medical\ndisciplines and countries. Where possible every effort has\nbeen made to ensure that the variations in healthcare sys-\ntem across the EU countries are taken into account during\nthe curriculum development. At the end of modules, there\nis the prospect of Self-assessment (S) of the participants to\nevaluate their knowledge and competency in teaching\nEBM. The assessment tools have been developed and val-\nidated and has been piloted in the partner countries. Use\nof short segments of slides combined with video clip\nrecordings of the actual EBM teaching in various clinical\nset up is aimed at arousing the Interest (I) of the learner.\nBy highlighting the differences in clinical practice, teach-\ning techniques, available resources and educational cul-\nture we have attempted to Speculate (S) on difficult and\ncontroversial areas of the course. The entire e-curriculum\nis devised in such a way that the learning process is System-\natic (S) with specific aims, learning objectives, content\nand summary for each module.\nThe use of the curriculum may be limited by the differ-\nences in clinical settings, EBM knowledge, resources and\nattitudes in various institutions and countries. The exam-\nples provided in the modules are limited to articles on\ntherapy. With increasing use of the modules in various\ncountries will help in further development with necessary\nadaptations as required.\nThe goal of this project is to help clinical trainers identify\nopportunities to teach trainees integration of EBM, pro-\nvide them with tips to perform this in various clinical set-\ntings[13] and to raise awareness about this curriculum for\ntrainers throughout Europe and ultimately incorporate it\nin mainstream curriculum. The dissemination systems in\nplace such as the website, presentations on national con-\nferences and workshops, word of mouth and publications\nin national language will allow access, discussion and dis-\nsemination of the results. The project partners are explor-\ning ways to involve their national networks of institutions\nthat might benefit from the process.\nCurrently in this project we have covered ways to teach\nEBM in six clinical settings. Furthermore to complement\nour previous project on EBM curriculum, we have pro-\nvided examples using systematic reviews of therapy. We\nare translating the course in six languages. In the future,\nwe plan to increase the number of modules to cover other\nclinical settings not currently included, provide examplesPage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Education 2009, 9:59 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6920\/9\/59using diagnostic and prognostic studies and make the cur-\nriculum relevant to healthcare professionals other than\ndoctors.\nConclusion\nThe EU EBM Training the Trainers curriculum will help\nsenior clinicians to identify and make the best use of avail-\nable opportunities in everyday practice in clinical situa-\ntions to teach various steps of EBM and demonstrate their\napplicability to clinical practice. Complete application of\nthis pilot project aimed at teachers of EBM will be a Euro-\npean qualification in teaching EBM, which will be used by\nsenior doctors, hospitals and professional bodies respon-\nsible for postgraduate qualifications and continuing med-\nical education. The EU EBM Training the Trainers project\nwill lead the way in bringing about teaching EBM closer to\neveryday clinical practice with the prospect of improving\npatient care.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nST, KSK and TNA drafted the first version of the manu-\nscript.
