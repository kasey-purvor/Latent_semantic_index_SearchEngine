In 1998, in Smoking Kills, the Government\noutlined an action plan for reducing smoking prevalence. This paper estimates\n2006 costs and the impact of declining prevalence. Estimates are derived from\ncosts, service use, and attributable proportions based on current and ex-smokers\u2019\nprevalence and relative risk compared with never-smokers. Comparable 1996\ncosts were estimated by substituting 1996 prevalence. Smoking-attributable\nhospital admissions cost the NHS an estimated \u00a31 billion in 2006, outpatient\nattendances cost \u00a3190 million, general practitioner (GP) consultations \u00a3530\nmillion, practice nurse consultations \u00a350 million and GP prescriptions \u00a3900\nmillion; \u00a32.7 billion in total. This represents 5% of adult hospital admission\ncosts, 4% outpatients, 11% GP and 8% practice nurse consultations and 12% of\nprescription costs. Smoking accounted for 24% of respiratory disease hospital\nadmission costs and 16% of cancer and cardiovascular disease costs (people aged\n>35 years). The 2006 cost is estimated to be 13% lower than if smoking had\nremained at 1996 levels. Smoking represents a substantial cost throughout the\nNHS. Significant savings are associated with a reduction in prevalence, but much\nof this stems from an earlier phase of the smoking epidemic. Securing future such\nsavings requires further policies to reduce smoking prevalence.\n1. Introduction\nCurrent estimates for England indicate that more than one in six deaths of\nadults aged 35 years and above are caused by smoking (The NHS Information\nCentre for Health and Social Care, 2008). As well as reducing life expectancy,\n*Correspondence to: Sea\u00b4n Boyle, Senior Research Fellow, LSE Health and Social Care, London School of\nEconomics and Political Science, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, UK. Email: s.boyle@lse.ac.uk\n489\nsmoking can be associated with years of mild-to-severely debilitating ill-health,\nthe trauma of associated medical procedures and dependence on medication.\nThis represents an individual cost to smokers that is hard to quantify. In\nthis paper, we focus on the financial cost of smoking to the National Health\nService (NHS).\nIn 1998, the UK Department of Health published \u2018Smoking Kills\u2019, the first\nGovernment White Paper specifically on tobacco control, setting out a plan of\naction for reducing smoking prevalence, and hence the burden of smoking-\nattributable diseases (Department of Health, 1998). The report estimated that\nthe cost of smoking to the NHS in England was between \u00a31.4 and \u00a31.7 billion in\n1996 (Buck et al., 1997; Parrott et al., 1998). As part of a continuing review of\nprogress, we estimate the cost of smoking to the NHS 10 years later, in 2006.\nThese are the costs of treating smokers for diseases caused by their smoking,\ntaking account of hospital admissions, general practitioner (GP) consultations\nand prescriptions, practice nurse consultations and outpatient attendances.\nDirect comparisons with 1996 estimates are ruled out by methodological dif-\nferences and NHS developments in service provision and costing in the intervening\n10 years. Instead, using the same approach as for 2006, we produce a hypothetical\nestimate of the costs had smoking prevalence remained at 1996 levels.\n2. Method\nThe methodology builds on that used to estimate mortality, morbidity and\nhospital costs for London (Callum and White, 2004). Health service use among\ncurrent and ex-smokers is compared with that of never-smokers and the excess\nattributed to smoking (except conditions associated with pregnancy, which are\nbased solely on risks of current smoking). For hospital admissions we used a\ndisease-based approach; for primary care and outpatients, this was not possible\nand a simple measure of excess service use was used. The excess is measured in\nthe form of a relative risk, current or ex-smokers\u2019 health service use relative to\nthat of never-smokers. Together with exposure to these risks \u2013 the proportion\nwho are current or ex-smokers \u2013 an estimate of the proportion attributable to\nsmoking can be obtained from the following standard formula:\nAttributable proportion\u00bc \u00bdpcur\u00f0rcur\u00021\u00de \u00fe pex\u00f0rex\u00021\u00de\u0003=\u00bd1 \u00fe pcur\u00f0rcur\u00021\u00de\n\u00fepex\u00f0rex\u00021\u00de\u0003\nwhere pcur5proportion who are current smokers; rcur5 relative risk for current\nsmokers compared with never-smokers; pex5proportion who are ex-smokers;\nand rex5 relative risk for ex-smokers compared with never-smokers [where\nrelative risk is for a disease (hospital admissions), or of having had a GP or\npractice nurse consultation, prescription or outpatient attendance].\nThis proportion is then applied to total numbers of hospital admissions by disease,\nGP consultations, etc, yielding an estimate of the number attributable to smoking.\n490 C H R I S T I N E C A L L U M E T A L .\nThe cost to the NHS is then obtained by multiplying the attributable number by\nestimates of unit cost.\nAlternative approaches have been concerned with costs over the lifetime of an\nindividual (the life cycle approach) in which case the impact of reductions in\nmortality, that is, increased life expectancy as a result of lower levels of smoking\nwould need to be taken into account (Sloan et al., 2004). In other words, if life\nexpectancy increases, ceteris paribus, more will be spent on health care in total over\na lifetime, although the annual spend per individual may well fall. Our focus is on\nthe extra cost to the NHS in a particular year associated with smoking, that is, we\ntake a cross-sectional approach. Account is not taken of any savings that may occur\nin that year as a result of excess deaths of smokers in previous years.\nTo estimate the costs therefore involves identifying: (i) diseases caused by\nsmoking (for hospital admissions); (ii) current and ex-smokers\u2019 relative risks for\nthese diseases and for primary care consultations, prescriptions and outpatient\nvisits; (iii) admitted patient care totals for diseases and total numbers of primary\ncare consultations, prescriptions issued and outpatient visits; (iv) NHS unit costs\nfor admitted patient care by disease and for primary care and outpatient visits;\nand (v) the proportion of current and ex-smokers.\n2.1 Hospital admission costs\n2.1.1 Diseases and relative risks\nHospital admission costs are based on diseases with an established causal link;\ndiseases that are thought to be exacerbated by smoking are not included.\nPotentially fatal diseases caused by smoking are those listed in the 2004 report\nof the US Surgeon General (US Department of Health and Human Services,\n2004), including several cancers, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and\npeptic ulcer; we additionally included cancers with site unspecified.\nRelative risks for each disease, separate for current and ex-smokers, are based\non the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), an American Cancer Society pros-\npective study started in 1982 of 1.2 million adults across the United States\n(Stellman and Garfinkel, 1986). The relative risks used here are those derived for\nthe estimation of mortality in 1995 in the United Kingdom (Callum, 1998) and\nin light of more recent evidence, including in our estimates, those for\ncervical cancer, other heart and arterial diseases. Following the approach of Peto\net al. (1992), the relative risks are based on the years 1984\u20131988 and estimated\nfrom current, ex- and never-smokers\u2019 deaths and exposure for men and women\nin five-year age groups using the Mantel\u2013Haenszel pooling method (Rothman,\n1986). This is an age-standardised approach that takes account of the very few\nor zero deaths occurring in some cells, especially those related to never-smokers.\nThe method assumes a uniform effect within the age range for which it is calculated.\nThe first two years were excluded on account of the bias in short-term results of\nEstimating the cost of smoking to the NHS 491\nprospective studies; a tendency to exclude people who are sick at the outset\nmeans lower mortality rates than in the general population, with the result\nthat the effects of smoking are accentuated and relative risks elevated. The\ndisadvantage of excluding the first two years is that the measurements of\nexposure, obtained at the start of the study, become less accurate with duration\nof follow-up; current smokers who quit smoking continue to be recorded as\ncurrent smokers and ex-smokers who relapse continue as ex-smokers.\nNon-fatal diseases were identified from an overview (Wald and Hackshaw,\n1996), and relative risks obtained from a number of sources (Independent Scien-\ntific Committee on Smoking and Health, 1988; Logan, 1990; Cole et al., 1993;\nLaw and Hackshaw, 1997; Christen et al., 2000; Tomar and Asma, 2000). Age-\nrelated cataract risks for women are set equal to those estimated for men (Christen\net al., 2000). Ex-smokers\u2019 relative risks for hip fracture are assumed to be the same\nas those of current smokers at the age at which they quit smoking (Law and\nHackshaw, 1997). For this, distributions by sex and age for ex-smokers according\nto the age at which they quit were derived using data from the Health Survey for\nEngland 2006 (National Centre for Social Research and University College\nLondon Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, 2008).\nTo present a balanced assessment, we included diseases that can be prevented\nby smoking. Relative risks were obtained for current and ex-smokers, separately\nwhen available, otherwise combined. Risks for potentially fatal diseases were\nagain based on CPS-II, in the case of endometrial cancer, during 1984\u20131992 and\nin the case of Parkinson\u2019s disease on the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, a follow-up\nstudy of CPS participants started in 1992\u20131993 (Thacker et al., 2007). Risks for\nnon-fatal diseases were obtained from a number of sources (Logan, 1990; Ross\net al., 1990; Hall and Harper, 1992).\nThe complete list of diseases with ICD-10 (International Classification of\nDiseases, 10th Revision) codes is provided in Appendix 1.\n2.1.2 Hospital admissions and costs\nHospital admission estimates are based on April 2006\u2013March 2007 Hospital\nEpisode Statistics (HES) for the whole of England. For ICD-10-coded disease\nas primary diagnosis, hospital admissions and bed-days by sex, 10-year age\ngroup and Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) were provided by the London\nHealth Observatory. This excludes diseases that appear only as a secondary\ndiagnosis on the hospital admission record. However, since primary diagnosis is\ndefined as the main reason why the patient is in hospital, whereas secondary\ndiagnosis is defined merely as relevant to the episode of care \u2013 although in some\ncases this may add to the complexity of care \u2013 we believe most of the costs will\nbe captured through the use of episodes with appropriate primary diagnosis.\nMoreover, the quality of coding of secondary diagnosis in HES data has been\nhistorically poor, and so would add a greater degree of uncertainty.\n492 C H R I S T I N E C A L L U M E T A L .\nAdmissions are either day cases (i.e. not staying overnight) or ordinary\ninpatient admissions (i.e. staying at least one night). During a stay (also known\nas a spell) in a hospital, the care of a patient may transfer from one consultant\n(specialist) to another, for example, from an orthopaedic consultant to the care\nof an elderly consultant, and these are recorded separately as Finished Con-\nsultant Episodes (FCEs) within that one hospital stay. Hence, each hospital stay\nor spell consists of one or more FCEs, most stays involving only one (88% in\n2006\u20132007). Costings used within the NHS are spell-based, and therefore a\nspell-based approach was used in this paper for the purpose of the costing\nexercise. Day cases by definition are completed spells and cost estimates are\nbased on day case data from the admission record. Inpatient costs are based on\nthe overall length of stay in bed-days, or spell duration, as recorded in the\ndischarge record for the last FCE in the spell. Hence, inpatient costs are based\non primary diagnosis for the discharge episode. Discharge episodes include\n2005\u20132006 admissions for spells stretching into 2006\u20132007, and it is assumed\nhere that they are balanced out by unfinished spells for admissions in\n2006\u20132007 stretching into 2007\u20132008.\nDay case and bed-day unit costs for diseases were derived from the NHS\nFCE reference costs (Department of Health, 2006). Reference costs are not\ndisease-coded but based instead on HRGs. We mapped these to ICD-10 using\nday case and bed-day tables of HRG by ICD-10. The disease-specific cost\nestimates are a weighted sum of constituent HRG costs using proportionate\ndistributions of HRG within ICD-10 as weights. Day and bed-day costs for\nsmoking-attributable diseases were calculated for the age group to which the\nsmoking-attributable risks apply. Reference costs for disease groups and for\nthe group of all causes (i.e. all ICD codes including non-smoking related) were\ncalculated separately.\nReference costs for inpatient admissions are published separately for elective\nand non-elective admissions. These include basic FCE costs and excess bed-day\ncosts, the latter associated with a longer than expected length of stay and defined\nas the number of bed-days over and above pre-determined \u2018trim points\u2019. Average\ncosts per bed-day were calculated by combining FCE and excess bed-day elective\nand non-elective reference costs.\nPublished reference costs for 2006\u20132007 use the most recent HRG coding,\nHRG4. Hospital episode data, however, are coded according to the previous\nversion, HRG 3.5. In the absence of an HRG 3.5 to HRG 4 mapping, reference\ncosts for 2005\u20132006 were used, inflated to 2006\u20132007 prices using the Hospital\nand Community Health Services pay and prices index. Using 2005\u20132006\nreference costs means that 2005\u20132006 elective\/non-elective and bed-days\/excess\nbed ratios are assumed to apply in 2006\u20132007.\nFor each disease, the total cost was obtained by summing day case costs\n(number of day cases multiplied by average day case cost) and total bed-day\ncosts (number of bed-days multiplied by average cost per bed-day).\nEstimating the cost of smoking to the NHS 493\n2.2 Primary care and outpatient attendances\nPrimary care consultation and outpatient attendance costs are not disease-based but\nare based on generic NHS service use data, and relate to all adults (aged>16 years).\n2.2.1 Relative risks\nRelative risk estimates were derived from data for England on the number of GP\nconsultations in the past two weeks, and the number involving prescriptions, number\nof practice nurse consultations in the past two weeks and number of outpatient visits\nin the past three months as reported in the 2006 General Household Survey (GHS)\n(Office for National Statistics Social and Vital Statistics Division, 2008).\nRespondents were asked the number of times they had talked to a doctor in\nthe past two weeks, and follow-up questions for each occasion ascertained\nwhether it was an NHS or private doctor, where the consultation had taken\nplace, on whose behalf, and for which household member if not on their own\nbehalf, and whether a prescription had been issued. The analysis is based on the\nnumber of NHS GP consultations made on behalf of the respondent. This\nconsists of \u2018own behalf\u2019 consultations and consultations made on their behalf by\nanother household member, the latter constructed by re-allocating all \u2018other\nperson\u2019s behalf\u2019 consultations to the appropriate household member. For the\nvery small number in which it seemed that the respondent had simply accom-\npanied the household member, consultations were not reassigned.\nRelative risks for prescriptions are based on the number of GP consultations\ninvolving a prescription. Repeat prescriptions are said to account for more than 70%\nof all prescriptions, and most are issued without talking to a GP, and hence not\ncounted in reports based on GP consultations. While understating the scale of pre-\nscriptions issued, the assumption made here is that the relative risks for current and\nex-smokers derived from GP consultations are applicable to all prescriptions issued.\nFor practice nurse consultations, respondents were asked to report only those\nconsultations made on their own behalf. Relative risks for outpatient attendances\nare based on the reported number of visits during the previous three months. These\nreports are less reliable than primary care reports on two main accounts. First, three\nmonths retrospective reporting is less reliable than two weeks. Second, misreporting\ncan arise from the possible confusion of outpatient attendances with other patient\ncare \u2013 day case admissions or non-admitted patient care such as regular day\nattendance or rehabilitation services, for example.\nCurrent and ex-smokers\u2019 relative risks for men and women aged 16 years and\nabove were estimated using negative binomial regression, including age, sex, region,\nNational Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS SEC) of household reference\nperson and marital status including cohabitation. A negative binomial model was\nselected as appropriate for these count data. Estimates and 95% confidence inter-\nvals can be seen in Table 1. Estimates significantly greater than 1 (value 1 outside\nthe confidence interval) are used to estimate attributable proportions; otherwise,\n494 C H R I S T I N E C A L L U M E T A L .\nthe relative risk is set equal to 1. Higher ex-smokers\u2019, than current smokers\u2019,\nrelative risks suggest considerable post-diagnosis smoking cessation or reporting\nas such. Therefore, it is important to emphasise that the risks presented are\na means to estimate the overall impact of smoking and should not be seen as a\nreflection of risks of current smoking relative to ex-smoking.\n2.2.2 Total numbers and costs\nGP and practice nurse consultations: Total consultations were based on QRE-\nSEARCH regression estimates for England, 2006 (Hippisley-Cox et al., 2007),\nusing GP consultation rates by age to estimate numbers for those aged >16\nyears. Unit consultation costs are those, not including qualification costs, cal-\nculated by the Personal Social Services Research Unit (Curtis and Netten, 2007).\nPrescriptions: Total prescriptions and average prescription costs came from the\nPACT (Prescribing Analysis and Cost) data on general practice prescribing in\nEngland (Horner, 2007). The estimate of prescriptions for patients aged >16 years\nassumes the Prescription Cost Analysis age structure of all prescriptions dispensed in\nthe community (The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care, 2007).\nOutpatients: Total outpatient attendances were derived from the HES\n2006\u20132007 tables (The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care,\n2009), the number involving patients aged >16 years estimated pro rata.\nOutpatient attendance unit cost is the weighted sum, using HES attendances as\nweights, of first and follow-up attendance 2005\u20132006 NHS reference costs\n(Department of Health, 2006), inflated to 2006\u20132007.\n2.3 Smoking prevalence in 2006\nPrevalence by sex and age of adult current and ex-smokers used in the estimation\nof hospital admission costs was derived from the GHS 2006 data for England\n(Office for National Statistics Social and Vital Statistics Division, 2008).\nTable 1.

For smoking in pregnancy, prevalence was based on the 2005\nInfant Feeding Survey (IFS) proportions who smoked throughout pregnancy \u2013\nEngland figures (Bolling et al., 2007). Smoking prevalence figures by sex and age\nfor those aged 15 years and above are shown in Table 2.\nPrimary care and outpatients costs are based on prevalence among all those\naged 16 years and above\u2013 21.8% current smokers and 23.9% ex-smokers.\n2.4 Cost estimates assuming 1996 smoking prevalence\nCosts assuming prevalence had remained at 1996 levels were obtained by\nkeeping unit costs and diseases the same but substituting 2006 with 1996\nattributable proportions.

We therefore adjusted totals to include a\nsmall increment based on the difference between 1996 and 2006 attributable\nproportions. Smoking prevalence in 1996 was derived from weighted GHS 1996\ndata for England (Office for National Statistics Social and Vital Statistics\nDivision, 2002), using weights added retrospectively to the data set. Prevalence\namong 15-year-olds was obtained from the 1996 Smoking among Secondary\nSchoolchildren Survey (Office for National Statistics Social Survey Division,\n2000) and for smoking in pregnancy from the 1995 IFS (Office of Population\nCensuses and Surveys Social Survey Division, 1998). Smoking prevalence in\n1996 by sex and age is shown in Table 2. Altogether, 28.5% of those aged\n16 years and above were current smokers and 24.7% ex-smokers.\n3. Results\nTreating diseases caused by smoking cost the NHS an estimated \u00a32.7 billion in\n2006, equivalent to more than \u00a350 million each week (hospital admission and\noutpatient costs are actually based on activity during the financial year 2006\u2013\n2007). Costs are distributed approximately equally between secondary (45%)\nand primary care (55%), with \u00a31.02 billion spent on hospital admissions, \u00a3193\nmillion on outpatient attendances, \u00a3532 million on GP consultations, \u00a3903\nmillion on prescriptions and \u00a354 million on practice nurse consultations.\n3.1 Hospital admissions\nHospital admission costs by disease are shown in Table 3. As expected, where\nsmoking is the major risk factor for a disease, it accounts for most of the\ntreatment costs, for example, lung cancer (79%) and chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease (COPD; 81%). Where smoking is one of several risk factors,\ntreatment costs for high-prevalence diseases may be equally high, but the pro-\nportions are lower (e.g. coronary heart disease (CHD), 20%). Although most\nadmission costs are for treating cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory disease,\nthere are notable costs for non-fatal diseases less often linked with smoking,\nincluding hip fracture (\u00a348.1 million) and cataracts (\u00a37.2 million).\nLung cancer, CHD, stroke and COPD account for 56% of net smoking-\nattributable admission costs, rising to 93% including other cancers, cardiovas-\ncular and respiratory diseases (Table 4). Cardiovascular disease is most costly, at\n\u00a3423 million, followed by cancer and respiratory disease at \u00a3273 million and\n\u00a3249 million, respectively.\nCompared with overall treatment costs, smoking impacts most on respiratory\ndisease, 24% of the total treatment costs (age >35 years) attributable to\nsmoking compared with 16% for cancer or cardiovascular disease (Table 5).\nJust over a third of the smoking costs occur in the care of people aged ,65\nyears. More than half of these costs are for treating cardiovascular disease.\nEstimating the cost of smoking to the NHS 497\nTable 3.

The largest\nimpact (15%) is associated with hospital admissions.\n4. Discussion\nThis study estimates the cost of smoking to the NHS in England in 2006 to be\n\u00a32.7 billion, accounting for 5% of adult hospital admission costs, 11% of GP\nconsultation and 12% of GP prescription costs, 8% of practice nurse con-\nsultation and 4% of outpatient costs. This represents a significant use of NHS\nresources, requiring a major investment in services and patient support.\nApplying 1996 smoking prevalence levels, in effect comparing the costs at a\nsingle point in time of treating people with smoking-attributable diseases, sug-\ngests that NHS costs could have been up to \u00a3388 million more.\nThe past decades have witnessed significant changes in smoking prevalence as\nthe detrimental health consequences of smoking became widely recognised,\nfewer people becoming smokers and more smokers quitting, each of these\ncontributing to the overall impact on health costs. Based on the GHS data, in\n1976 in England, for example, 46% of those aged 45\u201364 years were smokers;\n70% had ever been smokers and 35% of these ever-smokers had quit smoking.\nBy 1996, current smoking among the 45\u201364-year-olds had fallen to 28%; 59%\nwere ever-smokers and significantly more, 52%, had quit. Ten years later in\n2006, 22% were smokers and 49% were ever-smokers, 56% of whom had quit.\nAny change in the use of NHS resources reflects the effects of changes in\nprevalence over many years; for diseases with long lead times, such as lung\ncancer and especially those least susceptible to the reverse effects of quitting,\nongoing reductions are largely explained by changes in smoking behaviour\ndecades earlier. For diseases such as CHD where quitting can reverse the risks\nwithin a few years, the impact on costs is realised sooner.\nCosts presented here address the direct effects of smoking, that is, the cost of\ntreating smokers for diseases caused by their smoking, and no attempt has been\nmade to take account of the effects of passive smoking or of maternal smoking\nduring pregnancy. Treatment of fire injuries due to smoking were likewise omitted\nfrom hospital admission costs as they can include injuries of non-smokers.\nNHS costs represent only a small part of the total costs to society of smoking,\ntaking no account of related costs such as the need to provide continuing care for\npeople suffering from chronic diseases as a result of smoking. The most obvious\nexclusions are costs of social care and informal care for people with debilitating\nheart conditions, stroke, COPD, etc. The cost of private medical care is also not\nincluded. In addition, the full economic cost would include societal benefit pay-\nments such as disability living allowance, attendance allowance and incapacity\nbenefit as well as indirect costs such as the resulting loss of life or outputs. Where\nthe economic costs of individual diseases have been estimated, the cost to the NHS\nhas been shown to be a relatively small part of the total; for example, the most\nEstimating the cost of smoking to the NHS 501\nrecent estimate of the cost of stroke for the United Kingdom is \u00a39 billion, of which\njust 17% is the cost to the NHS (Saka et al., 2009).\nThe estimates in this paper reflect what is possible with the available data. The\nCPS-II relative risk data used in estimation of hospital costs, although developed\nin the 1980s, remain the best available for this purpose. Admittedly, the sample\nover-represents the more educated white population, but it could be argued that\nthis brings the advantage of greater homogeneity in composition of smokers and\nnon-smokers and hence estimates of relative risk are less likely to be confounded\nby social class (Callum, 1998).\nWe are aware of issues concerning what is included in attributable health\nservice use as well as how primary and secondary care are costed: both of these\nmerit further consideration. Thus, hospital admission estimates were based on\ndiseases with established evidence of causality. We did not include those for\nwhich there is accumulating evidence of a causal link such as type II diabetes and\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, or those associated with reproduction such as infertility\n(Hackshaw, 2004), or those exacerbated by smoking such as asthma, and may\ntherefore have slightly understated the burden of smoking on hospital admission\ncosts. In addition, data considerations precluded using this disease-specific\napproach for primary care and outpatient estimates. Instead, they rely on generic\nexcess service use and thus include all diseases, covering those such as age-related\nmacular degeneration and psoriasis, which, though debilitating, are unlikely to\nrequire hospitalisation, and also milder health symptoms that may be precursors\nto disease. However, they also include diseases such as asthma, exacerbated\nrather than caused by smoking. Furthermore, basing excess use solely on a\nstatistical association does risk including effects that are not all directly attri-\nbutable to smoking; the direction of causality between smoking and mental\nhealth, for example, is complex.\nAs for the costs, some components of admitted and outpatient care were\ncosted separately and not included in the basic reference costs used here \u2013 for\nexample, critical care services and specialist care such as chemotherapy and\nradiotherapy. In addition, some secondary care costs are not included, notably\naccident and emergency and paramedic\/ambulance costs. Reference costs are\npublished for these but the service delivery data do not readily lend themselves\nto producing estimates comparable to those already included. And finally, our\nestimates of primary care costs do not include dental health services, although\nsmoking is a major risk factor for periodontal disease. This was because the\nbanding scheme for costing dental treatments does not allow identification of\nnumbers and unit costs of specific treatments.\nMany of these costing issues may be addressed in future through the pro-\ngramme budget analysis being developed by the Department of Health. This\nattempts to allocate all NHS costs including those omitted in our analysis\nto ICD-based programme budget categories (PBCs) on the basis of mapping\nindicative provider costs; however, these are still at an early developmental stage.\n502 C H R I S T I N E C A L L U M E T A L .\nThe usefulness of these programme budget data will be enhanced as their\nreliability and scope increase, although as they stand, the PBCs do not uniquely\nidentify each smoking-attributable disease.\nNevertheless, to illustrate and compare their use, we derived PBC-based\nestimates of secondary care costs for the three disease groups that accounted\nfor 93% of hospital admission costs (i.e. cancer, cardiovascular disease and\nrespiratory disease; see Appendix 2 for the method). The estimated smoking-\nattributable secondary care cost of treating these diseases is \u00a31.6 billion; this\nwould imply an overall cost of smoking to the NHS of \u00a33.1 billion. Adding\nmore tenuous PBC-based estimates for other diseases does not affect this total.\nHowever, this secondary care cost estimate required the strong assumption that\nproportions of PBC hospital admissions that are for smoking-related diseases\ncan be extrapolated for that category to all other aspects of secondary care.\n5. Conclusion\nWe have shown that although smoking continues to represent a substantial\ncost throughout the NHS, there have been significant savings associated with\na reduction in prevalence. Much of this is due to the considerable reductions\nin prevalence during the 1960s and between the mid-1970s and early 1980s,\nand on this account we can expect to see further savings in the coming\nyears. However, with prevalence levelling out around the mid-1990s and\nresuming only a slow decline since 2000, the outlook beyond this could be less\npromising.\nRecent government policy has introduced a range of controls on the sale\nand use of tobacco including the banning of smoking in enclosed work and\npublic places, banning various forms of advertising and increasing the age of\nsale for tobacco products from 16 to 18 years. In addition, there has been\nemphasis on cessation activities through a network of NHS Stop Smoking\nServices and provision of pharmaceutical stop-smoking aids. (Department of\nHealth, 2008).\nNevertheless, maintaining the present rate of decline in prevalence is not\nenough to secure additional savings on the scale already seen; this urgently\nrequires new policies aimed at discouraging people from becoming smokers and\ngetting more smokers to quit. To this end, and in the longer term, it is parti-\ncularly important to focus on children and young people to prevent them from\ntaking up smoking in the first place. The Health Bill before Parliament in 2009\ntakes some steps in this direction by introducing further controls, namely the\nremoval of point-of-sale displays in shops, which have increasingly been used as\nadvertising to lure consumers, and the restriction of access to vending machines\neither by location or mode of operation so that only people aged >18 years can\nuse them. Unfortunately, these measures are unlikely to be fully enacted until\n2013 at the earliest (The Stationery Office, 2009).\nEstimating the cost of smoking to the NHS 503\nAcknowledgements\nThe Hospital Episode Statistics were made available by the NHS Health and\nSocial Care Information Centre and supplied by the London Health Observa-\ntory.

Programme budget category-based secondary care costs\nHere, we attempt, using the Department of Health PBC costs, to obtain a rough\nidea of the scale of secondary care smoking costs had we been able to include\ncosts currently precluded by data limitations. For programme budgeting, all\nsecondary care costs are mapped to PBCs. However, these are fairly broad\nICD-based categories, and though there are PBC subcategories, it is often the\ncase that costs cannot be uniquely allocated and instead are recorded within a\nresidual \u2018other\u2019 subcategory. This exercise is based on the broad PBCs.\nProvider returns for primary and secondary care PBC costs were obtained via\nthe Program Budget Guidance Manual excel workbook link (Department of\nHealth, 2007a). Final PBC costs, primary and secondary care combined, are\npublished in the resource accounts of the Department of Health (Department of\nHealth, 2007b). Resource accounts-based estimates of secondary care costs were\nobtained by assuming the same proportion secondary as for provider returns.\nOn the basis of our cancer, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease\nhospital admission costs and PBC cancers and tumours, problems of circulation\nand problems of the respiratory system secondary care costs, we obtain disease\ngroup secondary care cost estimates. First, disease group and PBC ICD-10 codes\nEstimating the cost of smoking to the NHS 507\nwere compared. PBCs are on the whole broader groupings than disease groups,\nincluding more ICD codes. By matching PBC and disease group ICD to HES\nprimary diagnosis coded data, we obtained disease group hospital admissions as\na proportion of PBC hospital admissions. Making the strong assumption that\nproportions of PBC hospital admissions, which are for smoking-related diseases,\ncan be extrapolated to all other aspects of secondary care, these proportions\nmultiplied by PBC costs provided disease group estimates of secondary care\ncosts. In the case of cardiovascular disease, some ICDs (10% of cardiovascular\nadmissions) are allocated to PBCs other than problems of circulation, and for\nthese the proportions of admissions they represent in their respective PBCs were\nobtained. The total cardiovascular cost is the sum of constituent PBC costs.\nSmoking-attributable costs were obtained by multiplying these totals by all-age\ndisease group smoking-attributable proportions.\nEstimates for other diseases were obtained in similar manner, basing total\ncosts on their proportionate admissions profile in the respective budget category.\nDiseases in the same PBC were grouped together in the calculations. These\nestimates are more tenuous than disease group estimates as applying this method\nto individual diseases within PBCs stretches the assumptions about propor-\ntionate costs even further. However, an alternative approach, uprating hospital\nadmission costs by the same factor as for the three disease groups combined was\nconsidered inappropriate as initial indications are that these, especially cardio-\nvascular disease, would overstate additional costs.\nFinally, for an estimate of the total cost of smoking, our hospital admission\nand outpatient costs are replaced by these secondary care cost estimates.\n508 C H R I S T I N E C A L L U M E T A L .\n"}
