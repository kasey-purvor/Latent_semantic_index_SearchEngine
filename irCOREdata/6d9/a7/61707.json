It is clear that adia-24 \nbatic changes resulting from the gradual buildup of the ring current (Kim and Chan, 1997), as 25 \nwell as magnetopause shadowing of closed electron drift paths (Wilken et al., 1986; Shprits et 26 \nal., 2006a), are insufficient to account for the observed losses throughout most of the trapping 27 \nregion. Currently, the most promising mechanism for MeV electron loss is VLF wave scattering 28 \n 2\n(Lorentzen et al., 2001) into the loss cone. Although field line stretching probably plays a role in 29 \nthe local time dependence of loss (Onsager et al., 2002; Green et al., 2004) at higher L-values, 30 \nrecent evidence suggests that wave scattering may be the most important overall loss process 31 \n(Millan and Thorne, 2007). 32 \nIt is significant that the L-shell of the maximum outer radiation belt flux correlates well with 33 \nthe statistical location of the plasmapause as a function of Dst (e.g., Li et al., 2006). This sug-34 \ngests that the cold plasma density in the plasmasphere plays an important role in controlling the 35 \nL-dependent inward penetration of the outer radiation belts. While progress has been made in 36 \nunderstanding the action of some loss processes and their consequences for controlling outer ra-37 \ndiation belt morphology, in-situ measurements from throughout the inner magnetosphere are 38 \ncritical to the development of an understanding of how radiation belt particles are lost (Meredith 39 \net al., 2006). This paper utilizes such an approach. 40 \nInterior to the plasmapause, a variety of waves contribute to electron decay rates (Abel and 41 \nThorne, 1998). These include whistler-mode waves from plasmaspheric hiss, from lightning, and 42 \nfrom ground-based transmitters that leak out into the magnetosphere. Just outside the plasma-43 \npause, chorus is thought to produce electron microburst precipitation (Lorentzen et al., 2001) and 44 \nother electron scattering (Shprits et al., 2007). The competition between acceleration and loss 45 \nover an extended region near the plasmapause must be resolved in order to understand electron 46 \ndynamics in the heart of the radiation belts. The plasmapause often resides in the region near 5 47 \nRE. However, during disturbed times it typically moves to lower L. The plasmapause moves 48 \nwithin 3.5 RE approximately 5-40 times per year, depending on the specific solar cycle, with 49 \nmore than 20 occurrences in most years (based on model calculations). During the 2003 Hallow-50 \n 3\neen storm the plasmapause was displaced inside 2 RE and remained at this compressed location 51 \nfor several days (Baker et al., 2004). 52 \nAs will be described in this paper, the 2003 Halloween Storm was a remarkable \u201cactive\u201d ex-53 \nperiment performed by nature. It produced a \u201cnew\u201d radiation belt inside the magnetosphere 54 \n(Baker et al., 2004), caused by wave acceleration by whistler mode chorus (Horne et al., 2005; 55 \nShprits et al., 2006b) which could then be observed to decay over the subsequent days and 56 \nweeks. The powerful storm that occurred just three weeks after the Halloween Storm (on 20 No-57 \nvember 2003) produced a distinctive set of electron acceleration and loss processes that have 58 \nbeen studied previously in some detail (Bortnik et al., 2006). 59 \nIn the present paper we examine several specific acceleration, or enhancement, events that 60 \nwere observed after the 2003 Halloween Storm period during the years 2003-2005. We focus on 61 \nthe range 1.5 \u2264 L \u2264 2.5 in the inner magnetosphere and we determine empirical electron lifetimes 62 \nby observing flux decay timescales. These lifetimes are compared and contrasted with prior re-63 \nsults and theoretical expectations. 64 \n 65 \n1. Data Selection 66 \nThe primary data set used in this paper is the E=2-6 MeV electron channel of the Solar, 67 \nAnomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) Proton\/Electron Telescope (PET) 68 \nexperiment (see Baker et al., 1993). SAMPEX operates in a roughly circular 600-km altitude, 69 \n82\u00b0-inclination orbit. For the present study, we use daily averages of electron data sorted accord-70 \ning to magnetic L-shells. The L-values correspond roughly to the geocentric radial distance in 71 \nEarth radii (1 RE = 6372 km) that a magnetic field line crosses the equatorial plane. L-values are 72 \ndetermined using the IGRF magnetic field model. It is recognized that for higher L-values (e.g., 73 \n 4\nL \u2265 5.0), there can be significant distortion away from a dipole configuration. Here we focus on 74 \nrelatively low L-values where the IGRF approximation is quite good. 75 \nIn order to place SAMPEX particle measurements into context, we have also used upstream 76 \nsolar wind data from the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft and ground-based 77 \ngeomagnetic information (such as Kp and Dst). These data show that the events analyzed here 78 \nare associated with significant geomagnetic storms. However, the principal point is specifically 79 \nto examine inner zone and radiation belt slot region enhancements in their own right, irrespective 80 \nof ring current, solar wind, or other geomagnetic variations. 81 \nIt is recognized that low-altitude measurements of electron fluxes may be subject to some 82 \nambiguity in timing as compared to measurements near the magnetic equator. However, the \u201cre-83 \nmarkable coherence\u201d seen between near-equatorial platforms and the low-altitude SAMPEX 84 \nmeasurements (e.g., Kanekal et al., 2001) suggests that this is not generally a severe problem. 85 \nWe therefore start with the assumption that the lifetimes derived from SAMPEX data are indica-86 \ntive of the inner zone and slot-region relativistic electron populations as a whole. 87 \n 88 \n2. Observations 89 \nFigure 1 summarizes solar wind speed and relativistic electron (2-6 MeV) intensities for the 90 \nyears 2003 through 2005, inclusive. Fig. 1a shows daily averages of the solar wind speed meas-91 \nured by ACE sensors. The dashed horizontal line at Vsw=500 km\/s emphasizes the widely-92 \nrecognized fact that solar wind speeds above this level almost always \u201cdrive\u201d relativistic electron 93 \nproduction throughout the outer radiation zone (e.g., Baker et al., 1998). Vsw was, on average, 94 \nabove 500 km\/s for most of 2003 and for the early part of 2004, due to the presence of recurrent 95 \n 5\nhigh-speed solar wind streams. For the latter part of 2004, the solar wind speed was quite low 96 \nand throughout 2005, the value of Vsw was mixed. 97 \nFigure 1b shows a color-coded representation of the 2-6 MeV electron flux measured by the 98 \nSAMPEX PET sensors. The vertical scale shows L-values and the horizontal scale is time (in 99 \nDay of Year [DOY], measured from the beginning of 2003). The logarithm of the directional 100 \nflux of 2-6 MeV electrons is shown by color as indicated by the color bar to the right of the fig-101 \nure. 102 \nAs would be expected based on the high solar wind speeds in 2003, the overall radiation belt 103 \npopulation was persistently elevated from DOY 1 through DOY~500, or so. Through the latter 104 \npart of 2004 and for much of 2005 (DOY~500 to DOY~850) the electron intensities were often 105 \nquite low for 3 \u2264 L \u2264 8. Notable exceptions were seen at DOY~580 (July 2004) and DOY~680 106 \n(November 2004) when powerful storms occurred, Vsw increased dramatically, and major relativ-107 \nistic electron events were initiated. 108 \nOne of the most striking features seen in Fig. 1b was the slot-filling event and the creation of 109 \na \u201cnew\u201d population of relativistic electrons in the inner zone (1.0 \u2264 L \u2264 2.0) in association with 110 \nthe 2003 Halloween Storm period (Baker et al., 2004). This belt of electrons appeared rather 111 \nsuddenly on DOY~305 and persisted through the end of 2005 (i.e., DOY~1100). The inner zone 112 \nbelt of electrons was seen to be enhanced by several of the storms (DOY=580, DOY=680, etc. 113 \nthat were noted in the previous paragraph. 114 \nIn order to better time and quantify the electron flux increases at various L-values, we have 115 \ntaken \u201ccuts\u201d in L from L=1.5 to L=2.2. These flux values for each L are shown by the different 116 \ncolored lines in Fig. 2. This representation shows that the Halloween Storms enhanced the elec-117 \ntron flux at L=1.5 by a factor of ~50 or more. This inner zone flux then remained very elevated 118 \n 6\nto the end of 2005 (decaying gradually over time). On the other hand, the flux values at L=2.0 \u00b1 119 \n0.2 increased by as much as five orders-of-magnitude and then decayed quite rapidly in each 120 \ncase back to pre-Halloween values. At least 5 electron enhancement events can be easily identi-121 \nfied following the large October-November 2003 event. 122 \n 123 \n3. Analysis and Interpretation 124 \nThe abrupt rises and more gradual decays of electron fluxes seen in several events in Fig. 2 125 \nsuggest that we can make empirical determinations of electron lifetimes assuming the fluxes to 126 \ndecay exponentially. We have performed such analyses for the six distinct enhancement-decay 127 \nepisodes seen from November 2003 through the end of 2005 by performing least-squares fits for 128 \neach decay interval to obtain life times. 129 \nFigure 3 shows detailed examples for three of the intervals. Figure 3a is for the Halloween 130 \nStorm (and, in addition, the 20 November 2003 storm, since their effects were commingled). The 131 \nred curve shows the flux profile for L=1.5, while the blue curve shows the L=2.0 profile. The 132 \nblack dashed lines show exponential decay (least-squares) fits to the data trends. At L=1.5, we 133 \nfind that J=Ke-t\/\u03c4 with \u03c4~180 days. (This same decay rate applies for essentially all of the L=1.5 134 \ndata through the end of 2005). For the L=2.0 data we have specifically fit the data points for 305 135 \n\u2264 DOY \u2264 410. This fit gives \u03c4=18.6 days. Note that from DOY~410 to DOY~560, the decay rate 136 \nwas slower with a decay lifetime in excess of 30 days. Thus, the apparent electron lifetimes de-137 \npend on the length of interval chosen for analysis. We have typically examined periods of ~100 138 \nday duration. 139 \nFig. 3b shows the next major storm enhancement event that commenced on DOY~570 (~23 140 \nJuly 2004). This corresponded to a complex, multi-step geomagnetic storm that reached Dst~ -141 \n 7\n200 nT. We have fit the decay of this event at L=2.0 for the period 575 \u2264 DOY \u2264 675 and find 142 \n\u03c4=13.4 days. As a final illustrative example, a much weaker event that commenced about 143 \nDOY=970 (late August 2005) is shown in Fig. 3c. For this event we find a much more gradual 144 \ndecay. For the interval 970 \u2264 DOY \u2264 1090, we find \u03c4 =26.5 days. 145 \nTable 1 shows the six intervals analyzed and the e-folding times for each interval at L=2.0. 146 \nAs noted previously, for L=1.5 a steady value of \u03c4~180d describes the decay throughout the en-147 \ntire period of time, aside from small bump-ups of flux associated with the major storms. On av-148 \nerage for L=2.0, we find a decay rate for all events to be < \u03c4 >=20.2d \u00b1 8.7. This is short com-149 \npared to previous theoretical estimates (e.g., Abel and Thorne, 1998). 150 \n 151 \n4. Summary and Discussion 152 \nTo summarize our key findings we note that: 153 \n1. The Halloween 2003 storms produced a \u2018new\u2019 inner zone relativistic (2-6 MeV) electron 154 \nbelt that persisted for years at L~1.5. 155 \n2. The gradual decay of the new belt was highly L-dependent: 156 \n\u2022 At L=1.5, the decay was seen to be J=K exp(-t\/\u03c4) with \u03c4~180d. 157 \n\u2022 At L=2.0, the decay exhibited \u03c4~18d. 158 \n3. Several subsequent storms in 2004-2005 produced clear flux enhancements 159 \nin the inner zone (6 events were readily identified). 160 \n4. The decay of the L=1.5 population continued throughout; the L=2.0 popu-161 \nlations decayed with 7.9 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 34.8d. 162 \n 8\n5. Theoretical estimates suggest that \u03c4-values at L=2.0 and E=2 MeV should 163 \nbe \u03c4~100d due to plasmaspheric hiss. 164 \nThe specifications of electron decay lifetimes are complicated due to the fact that there are 165 \nseveral competing wave-particle interaction mechanisms that can be operative. Inside the plas-166 \nmasphere, losses are mostly due to scattering caused by plasmaspheric hiss waves, by magneto-167 \nspherically-reflecting (MR) whistler waves, and by coulomb collisions (Abel and Thorne, 1998). 168 \nSuch loss had previously been estimated to lead to characteristic lifetimes of ~100 days at E~1.5 169 \nMeV energies. There were expected to be strong L- and energy-dependences. The Abel and 170 \nThorne (1998) calculations included the effects of losses due to VLF transmitters as well as hiss, 171 \nMR whistlers, and Coulomb collisions The assumptions made concerning VLF transmitters 172 \ncould be a source of discrepancy between observations and models.  173 \nOutside the plasmasphere, chorus emissions would produce very fast pitch angle scattering 174 \nleading to lifetimes of order one day or less (Horne et al., 2005; Albert, 2005). Electromagnetic 175 \nion cyclotron (EMIC) waves can possibly provide even faster losses of electrons with E>500 176 \nkeV (Summers and Thorne, 2003). Some estimates for EMIC losses \u2013 although quite localized 177 \nspatially \u2013 would give lifetimes of just hours. However, these waves need frequencies with high 178 \nvalues of fpe\/fce to resonate with ~2 MeV electrons. The ratio of fpe\/fce tends to become smaller as 179 \none goes to lower L inside the plasmapause (e.g., from 4 to 2). Thus, the EMIC waves will tend 180 \nto resonate with higher energy electrons, which probably become too high for the energies we 181 \nobserve here. Since these waves are generated by anisotropic proton distributions associated with 182 \nthe ring current, and the ring current does not usually penetrate to L=2, it is unclear how they can 183 \nbe generated near L=2.  184 \n 9\nFor the results reported here, we have focused on the spatial region inside L~3.0 and have 185 \nquantitatively assessed loss lifetimes for L~1.5-2.0. Under most circumstances (other than, say, 186 \nthe period right after the Halloween Storm), the L-values examined here would be well within 187 \nthe plasmasphere. Thus, we would expect the hiss lifetimes to be the applicable ones. 188 \nAs noted in Section 2 above, we believe that our determination of L-value for SAMPEX data 189 \nsorting is relatively accurate. Thus, this should provide a solid basis for theoretical comparison. 190 \nWe know that the chosen energy channel responds to a broad range of electrons and there could 191 \nbe some ambiguity in this matter. However, from our analyses (not shown here) we find the en-192 \nergy spectra around L=2.0 to be strongly falling (J=KE-\u03b3, with \u03b3~ 2.5). Thus, the data we have 193 \nshown would be dominated by electrons with E~2.0 MeV. 194 \nIn very recent work (Meredith et al., 2007), estimates have been made of electron lifetimes as 195 \na function of energy, L-value and geomagnetic activity levels. The analyses examine lifetimes 196 \ndue to hiss, ducted whistlers, and magnetospherically reflecting whistlers. It is found that at 197 \nL=2.0 and E~2 MeV, the lifetime for electrons would be at least \u03c4~100-200 days. The L-198 \ndependence, however, is very strong such that \u03c4 drops precipitously to 1-10 days at L=2.5. From 199 \nthe Meredith et al. (2007) modeling, the lifetime also drops rapidly with increasing energy. Thus, 200 \nthe experimental results we have presented here (with \u03c4 ~20d) have to be considered in the con-201 \ntext of great sensitivity to L position and the broad range (2-6 MeV) of our analyzed energy 202 \nrange. We note that the lifetimes of about 100 days in the Meredith et al. (2007) paper assume 203 \nAE* > 500nT during the decay. They are longer for AE* < 100 nT, particularly for 5 MeV elec-204 \ntrons.  205 \nOne possible explanation for the very short apparent electron lifetimes reported here lies in 206 \nthe fact that plasmaspheric hiss is mainly responsible for the loss of 2-6 MeV electrons at equato-207 \n 10\nrial pitch angles <65\u00b0 at L=2. Detailed model results show that it takes much longer to scatter 208 \nelectrons at larger equatorial pitch angles into the loss come. At L=2 and at 600 km, a 90\u00b0 pitch 209 \nangle particle at SAMPEX corresponds to approximately an 18\u00b0 particle at the equator in a di-210 \npole field. In a careful analysis motivated by the present observations, we find that the pitch an-211 \ngle diffusion rates for 2 MeV electrons at L=2 due to plasmaspheric hiss show a deep minimum 212 \nfor pitch angles greater than 65\u00b0. This means that electrons at larger equatorial pitch angles take 213 \nmuch longer to diffuse into the loss cone. This analysis also provides the decay rate of the elec-214 \ntron distribution function at the same energy. The initial condition assumed for the modeling is a 215 \nflat pitch angle distribution. The distribution function decays more quickly at small pitch angles 216 \nthan at 90\u00b0, as expected. The timescales for loss at 18\u00b0 equatorial pitch angle, corresponding to 217 \nthat which would be observed by SAMPEX, is 23 days, whereas the timescale for the whole dis-218 \ntribution to decay is 284 days (Meredith et al., 2007), assuming quiet magnetic activity (as repre-219 \nsented by AE* <100 nT). Thus there is good agreement with the observations presented here for 220 \nthe particles at pitch angles measured by SAMPEX. At higher L shells (L=2.5 and larger) there is 221 \nno deep minimum in the diffusion rates in the model. This would explain why we tend to get 222 \nsuch a high degree of global coherence at higher L values (Kanekal et al., 2001). 223 \nIn a paper in preparation, we pursue the issues raised here and we make more detailed com-224 \nparisons between observations and theoretical models. This continuing work should help further 225 \nclarify electron lifetime expectations in this key region of the inner magnetosphere. 226 \n 227 \nAcknowledgments.
