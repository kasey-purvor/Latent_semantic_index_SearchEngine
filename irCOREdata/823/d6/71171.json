Introduction\n[2] Electron temperature enhancements caused by\npowerful HF wave injection experiments have been meas-\nured by incoherent scatter radars many times since the first\nobservations by Gordon et al. [1971] and Gordon and\nCarlson [1974]. Nighttime observations of electron heating\nat Arecibo [Mantas et al., 1981] showed enhancements of\nsome 40% (about 350 K) which could be explained by a\ncomprehensive numerical model. It was found that about\nhalf the heating was caused by anomalous absorption and\nhalf by deviative absorption. Experiments done at night in\nwinter at solar minimum using an HF frequency of 3.175\nMHz showed much larger enhancements of about 1000 to\n2000 K [Djuth et al., 1987, Duncan et al., 1988] which\nwere explained by the much lower cooling rates caused by\npoor thermal coupling between the lower density plasma\nand the neutral atmosphere [Newman et al., 1988]. The\nonly other facility where HF-induced electron heating has\nbeen directly measured using incoherent scatter is EISCAT,\nin the high-latitude region. Most measurements were made\nduring the daytime [Jones et al., 1986; Stocker et al.,\n1992; Honary et al., 1993, 1995; Robinson et al., 1996]\nwhen the ionosphere is most stable and similar to that at\nmidlatitudes. Temperature increases up to about 55%\n(about 700 K) and electron density increases of up to\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

They examined several different days\nwhere the HF beam was vertical and other days when\nthe beam was near field-aligned, but no comparison\nbetween the results for different HF beam directions was\nmade. Honary et al. [1993] examined temporal fluctua-\ntions in the electron temperature and electron density and\nconcluded that they were driven by chemical perturbations\nrather than the self-focusing instability found in transport\ndominated regions at higher altitudes.\n[3] There is a close association between HF-induced\nelectron heating, the generation of artificial small-scale\nfield-aligned irregularities (AFAI) [Fialer, 1974; Minkoff\net al., 1974] and the phenomenon known as anomalous\nabsorption [Robinson, 1989; Robinson et al., 1996]. An O-\nmode HF wave couples through either pre-existing or\nartificially induced field-aligned electron density striations\ninto electrostatic (upper hybrid) waves at the upper-hybrid\nresonance (UHR) height. These waves propagate near\nperpendicular to the magnetic field and dissipate energy\nthereby heating the electron gas. The upper hybrid waves\ncan, due to thermal nonlinearities, excite filamentary density\nperturbations or striations which can trap the exciting upper\nhybrid field. Early theories concerned the initial thermal\nparametric instability [Grach and Trakhtengerts, 1976] and\nthe resonance instability [Vas\u2019kov and Gurevich, 1976].\nMore recently the nonlinear stabilization of the striations\nwas studied [Gurevich et al., 1995], including both the\nthermal parametric and the resonance instability [Istomin\nand Leyser, 1997]. These models are consistent with in situ\nrocket measurements at mid latitudes of the depletion depth\n(6%) and width (7 m) of small-scale striations [Kelley et al.,\n1995; Franz et al., 1999]. The result is efficient transfer of\nenergy from the HF wave into heat and the accompanying\nabsorption of diagnostic HF waves is known as anomalous\nabsorption [Gurevich et al., 1996].\n[4] The rocket data showed that the striations exist in\nbunches of about 1\u20132 km with similarly sized regions of no\nstriations in between. This bunching of striations has been\ninterpreted in terms of nonlinear self-focusing of the HF\nwave including the effect of trapping of the HF wave in\nlarge-scale density irregularities [Gurevich et al., 1999]. The\nbunching of striations can also occur simply by diffraction\nof the HF wave on the small-scale striations [Istomin and\nLeyser, 2001]. Further, experimental results on HF-induced\noptical emissions at high latitudes with its southward dis-\nplacement of the glow cloud [Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al., 1999;\nKosch et al., 2000; Pedersen and Carlson, 2001] and the\nassociated large electron temperature enhancements [Leyser\net al., 2000; Gustavsson et al., 2001] has also been\ninterpreted in terms of the nonlinear self-focusing of the\nHF wave in which the bunches of small scale striations are\nsoliton-like nonlinear structures [Gurevich et al., 2001].\n[5] It has been found that the temperature enhancements,\nlike anomalous absorption and other phenomena related to\nUH waves, also exhibit a dependence on the difference\nbetween pump frequency and gyrofrequency harmonic\n[Honary et al., 1995; Robinson et al., 1996]. In particular,\nthe heating was closely related to anomalous absorption and\nboth showed a strong minimum when the pump frequency\nwas near the third and fourth harmonic of the electron\ngyrofrequency. This last result in particular is very signifi-\ncant because it directly relates the electron heating mecha-\nnism, like several other phenomena, to electrostatic\ninstabilities. The anomalous absorption results near the third\ngyroharmonic could be explained by the nonlinear theory of\nGurevich et al. [1996]. In addition, the intensity of small-\nscale striations has a minimum at the gyroharmonics [Hon-\nary et al., 1999; Ponomarenko et al., 1999]. More recently it\nwas discovered that radio-induced red (630 nm) aurora also\nshows a minimum when pumping near a gyroharmonic\n[Bernhardt et al., 2000; Kosch et al., 2002a] as was\npredicted by Gurevich and Milikh [1997]. This clearly links\nradio-induced heating and optical emission to the same\nmechanism involving upper-hybrid waves and striations.\n[6] Until recently, very few EISCAT measurements of\nHF-modification effects in the F region were made at night.\nThe reason for this is that at night in the auroral region the F\nregion plasma density is often too low (under-dense) for the\nHF wave to interact effectively with the plasma. Further-\nmore, under disturbed auroral conditions, particle precip-\nitation may cause the E- and D-region plasma densities to be\ntoo high, either reflecting or absorbing the HF wave. Under\nsolar maximum and quiet magnetic conditions, however,\nthese obstacles are less common, as the data here show.\n[7] Since about October 1998, near the start of a max-\nimum in the sunspot cycle, it was noticed that electron\ndensities were often high enough (>2 \u0002 1011 m\u00013 such that\nthe plasma frequency exceeded the lowest useable HF\nfrequency of 4 MHz) in the F region at night such that\nHF-interaction experiments were possible, under relatively\nquiet geomagnetic conditions. A concerted effort was made\nto perform experiments at night with the result that from\nFebruary 1999 radio-induced aurora, also referred to as\nartificial airglow, was produced and imaged at Troms\u00f8\n[Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m et al., 1999]. The light emissions were asso-\nciated with large (factor up to 3.5) electron temperature\nenhancements measured using the EISCAT UHF radar\npointed along the magnetic field aligned direction [Leyser\net al., 2000; Gustavsson et al., 2001]. Other radio-induced\naurora results measured from Skibotn, 50 km to the east of\nthe HF facility, showed a pronounced southward displace-\nment of the glowing patch [Kosch et al., 2000, 2002b,\n2003]. Also radio-induced optical emissions measured at\nanother high-latitude heating facility, HAARP, have shown\na southward displacement [Pedersen and Carlson, 2001].\n[8] This southward displacement of the emissions shows\nsome similarity to other HF-interaction experiments [Isham\net al., 1999a, 1999b; Mishin et al., 2001] where the aspect\nangle dependence of various Langmuir turbulence effects\nwas measured. The experiments of Isham et al. used low\nduty cycle HF pulses to investigate the spatial occurrence of\nLangmuir and ion-acoustic waves measured by the EISCAT\nUHF (931 MHz) and to a lesser extent, VHF (224 MHz)\nincoherent scatter radars. When the center of the relatively\nwide HF beam was pointed 6\u0001 south, it was found that\nseveral phenomena were most pronounced when the narrow\nUHF radar beam was pointed between about 6\u0001 and 12\u0001\nsouth of zenith, corresponding to angles between the Spitze\nand the field-aligned position.\n[9] In view of all the above results which suggest that the\nF region approximately 50 km south of the HF facility is a\npreferred position for AFAI, radio-induced aurora, and some\nsignatures of Langmuir turbulence, we decided to perform\nSIA 2 - 2 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\nfurther experiments to see if the HF-induced electron tem-\nperature also shows a similar spatial dependence. This\nquestion arose because one of the postulated mechanisms\nfor the enhanced light emission is that the excitation of the\noxygen atoms is due to the Maxwellian tail of the heated\nelectron distribution [e.g., Mantas, 1994; Mantas and Carl-\nson, 1996], modified by the excitation of vibrational states in\nN2 [Mishin et al., 2000]. To this end, the UHF radar antenna\nwould scan several positions covering most of the HF beam\nwhile measuring electron temperatures, and the HF beam\nFigure 1. Data from the EISCAT UHF radar at Troms\u00f8 on 7 October 1999, obtained using the long-\npulse and analyzed with 20 s integration time, showing the effects of HF pumping. The HF was cycled 8\nmin on, 4 min off, with the beam directed at southward zenith angles shown below the upper and above\nthe lowest panels. The UHF antenna was continually scanned in a 4-min cycle between almost the same\npositions, 6\u0001, 0\u0001, 12.8\u0001 zenith angles, which are distinguishable by the varying upper altitude as labeled at\nthe upper right of the first panel. The solid line in the upper two panels connects points indicating the HF-\nenhanced ion line (HFIL) height obtained from the two power profiles. The HFIL height should be close\nto but below the HF reflection height.\nRIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING SIA 2 - 3\nwas also scanned through the same positions with a much\nslower cycle. The results of this experiment are presented\nbelow. At the same time observations of radio-induced\naurora were made as well as striations by using coherent\nbackscatter experiments with a unique bistatic HF Doppler\nscatter technique [Blagoveshchenskaya et al., 1998] and the\nCUTLASS coherent backscatter radar [Milan et al., 1997].\n[10] We present data from an experiment on 7 October\n1999 where both the HF-pump beam and the diagnostic\nradar beams were scanned in elevation between magnetic\nfield-aligned and vertical directions. Some of the character-\nistics of the topside electron temperature effects such as\npropagation and ion temperature increases and outflow are\ndiscussed. Electron temperature data from the remote site\nstations of Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8 are used to show that for a\ngiven plasma volume there is no dependence of the meas-\nured electron temperature on direction of the radar beam to\nthe magnetic field. Finally, we discuss the interpretation of\nthe strong dependence of the heating on the HF incidence\nangle.\n2. Experimental Details\n2.1. HF Facility\n[11] The EISCAT HF facility (69.59\u0001N, 19.23\u0001E) near\nTroms\u00f8, in northern Norway [Rietveld et al., 1993] was\nused to create large electron temperatures in the high-\nlatitude F region during quiet geomagnetic conditions in\nthe hours after sunset on 7 October 1999. The HF facility\nwas operated at 4.544 MHz, O-mode with a modulation\ncycle of 8 min on followed by 4 min off. All 12 transmitters\nwere used at 80 kWeach, using array 2 resulting in a gain of\n23.3 dBi and an effective radiated power (ERP) of 205 MW.\nThe width of the beam was 12\u0001 at the \u00013 dB point and was\n16.6\u0001 at the \u00016 dB point. The HF modulation started at\n1812 UT for a fixed direction of the HF beam at 6\u0001 south,\nbut from 1824 until 2000 UT the HF beam zenith angle was\nscanned electronically with the following 36 min cycle: 8\nmin 6\u0001 (Spitze), 4 min off, 8 min 0\u0001 (vertical), 4 min off, 8\nmin 12\u0001 (field-aligned), 4 min off. Note that the HF\nfrequency was well away from any gyrofrequency harmonic\nwhere a minimum in electron temperature enhancement has\nbeen found [Robinson et al., 1996].\n2.2. Radar Modulation\n[12] The EISCAT UHF radar was used with CP-1-K\nmodulation which involves a basic time resolution of 5 s\nand best altitude resolution of 3.1 km in power profile and\nalternating code data. A long pulse modulation also gives 21\nrange gates in the F region from 145 to 596 km with 22.5\nkm spacing and provides signal for tri-static observations at\n250 km using the Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8 receiving stations.\n3. Observations\n3.1. Troms\u00f8 Observations of 7 October 1999\n[13] Magnetic conditions were quiet. Ionograms from the\nTroms\u00f8 dynasonde showed that foF2 from 1910 to 1950 UT\nwas of the order of 4.9 MHz. The tristatic ion velocity\nmeasurements from the EISCAT UHF radar showed west-\nward ion drifts up to 200 m s\u00011 before about 1840 UT\nchanging to eastward drifts of up to about 300 m s\u00011\nafterwards. The north-south velocities are less than 100 m\ns\u00011 before 1840 UT after which they vary up to 200 m s\u00011.\nVector velocities derived from the HF sounder Doppler\nshifts show the magnetic east-west F region irregularity\ndrifts to be westwards and less than 100 m s\u00011 between\n1800 and 1845 UT, turning to eastwards and varying\nbetween 0 and 100 m s\u00011 up to 2000 UT. The north-south\ncomponent has an average near zero with excursions\nbetween \u00b160 m s\u00011. Why the HF sounder derived velocities\nappear to be smaller than the EISCAT velocities requires a\nmore detailed analysis which is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\n[14] Figure 1 shows the EISCAT data from Troms\u00f8 for\nbetween 1800 and 2000 UT on 7 October 1999 as the UHF\nradar beam was tilted from 0\u0001 zenith angle to 12.8\u0001 south to\n6\u0001 south and back to 0\u0001 in a 4-min cycle, spending a\nmaximum of 80 s per position. Figure 2 shows in more\ndetail the same data as in Figure 1 for three positions of the\nHF beam from 1846 to 1922 UT. At the top of each panel\nare shown the UHF antenna zenith angles. Data taken\nduring antenna movements are included in the 20 s inte-\ngrated data in both figures.\n[15] There are several features to note in the figures.\nIncreases in electron temperature (second panel) are obvious\nthroughout the 2-hour interval, and they get larger with time\nas the altitude of the F layer increases after sunset. There is a\nclear increase in the height of the F layer around 1825 UT.\nThe HF-enhanced ion line (HFIL), which is excited at or\nclose to but below the HF reflection height [e.g., Rietveld et\nal., 2000], and which was often observed immediately after\nHF turn-on, is shown in the top panel by the solid line\njoining the measured points on the bottomside F layer.\nThese measurements were made with the two power pro-\nfiles giving a resolution of up to 3.1 km in range. The upper\nhybrid resonance (UHR) height, which is where the stron-\ngest heating is thought to take place, was estimated from the\npower profile data to be between 3 and 9 km below the\nreflection height.\n[16] A striking feature is that for all three pointing\ndirections of the UHF antenna, the electron temperature\nincreases are larger when the HF beam is directed to 12\u0001\nzenith angle (field-aligned) and become successively\nweaker for the 6\u0001 and 0\u0001 positions. Furthermore, the\ntemperature increase is nearly always strongest at any given\nheight when the UHF antenna is pointed at 12.8\u0001, for all\nthree positions of the HF beam.\n[17] Although there are no obvious changes in electron\ndensity associated with the heating in the color plots, there\nare density depletions up to about 20% (about 4 \u0002 10\u000110\nm\u00013) above about 200 km. The change in density with\nantenna position, evident in Figures 1 and 2, is caused by\nhorizontal gradients in electron density. After about 1850\nUT the density increases towards the south.\nFigure 2. (opposite) A subset of the EISCAT UHF data from the 7 October 1999 data in Figure 1, showing more detail.\nThe numbers near the top of each panel show the UHF antenna zenith angles, whereas those between the upper two and\nlower two panels show the HF beam zenith angles. The height of the HFIL is shown by the dots joined by solid lines in the\nupper two panels.\nSIA 2 - 4 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\nRIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING SIA 2 - 5\n[18] The ion temperature increase (third panel) is modest,\nreaching about 100 degrees. Finally, there are ion outflows\n(bottom panel) reaching about 200\u2013300 ms\u00011 above 400\nkm in the field-aligned position associated with the electron\ntemperature increases.\n[19] Figure 3 shows an example from the field-aligned\nposition of profiles of the four main ionospheric parameters\nfor the HF turned on in the field-aligned position, compared\nwith when it was off. The clearest effects are seen in the\nelectron temperature and in the ion velocity. Such ion out-\nflows are often observed naturally in the auroral ionosphere,\nbut have never been reported as a result of HF-pumping\nexperiments. Ion outflows have long been predicted to be a\nresult of HF-heating experiments as in papers by Meltz and\nLelevier [1970], Vas\u2019kov et al. [1993], and Mingaleva and\nMingalev [1997].\n3.2. Electron Temperature Enhancements\n[20] From the three-position data in Figures 1 and 2, one\ncan draw contour plots in the meridian plane of the electron\ntemperature enhancements. Figure 4 shows typical contour\nplots of the electron heating for the three HF beam posi-\ntions. In each plot the temperature data from three radar\nprofiles in a 4-min interval associated with a given HF beam\nangle are combined into one contour plot. Although the\ncontours are the result of interpolation between only three\npositions, the strong field-aligned nature of the heating is\napparent. Extrapolation of the contours beyond the field-\naligned position is not valid for the present 3-position data.\nSubsequent measurements in February 2001, which will be\npublished separately, show that the temperature enhance-\nment decreases for radar antenna positions beyond field-\naligned.\n[21] To show more quantitatively the dependence of\nelectron temperature enhancement on the angle of the HF\nbeam to the magnetic field, we plot in Figure 5 the\nmaximum electron temperature enhancement, from near\nthe reflection height, as a function of radar beam angle to\nthe magnetic field for all the UHF antenna positions in\nFigure 1 between 1810 and 1946 UT which were pointed in\nthe same direction as the HF beam. The electron temper-\nature increase drops to half the field-aligned value when the\nHF beam is 5\u0001 further to the north, after which the decrease\nis much more gradual.\n[22] Figure 6 shows the HF-induced electron temperature\nenhancements as a function of zenith angle for three\nseparate directions of the HF beam from 1810 to 1946\nUT, with the radar pointing in the same direction as the HF.\n3.3. Remote Site Electron Temperatures\n[23] One possible interpretation of the high electron\ntemperatures measured along the field-aligned direction\ncompared with other directions is that the electron temper-\nature measurement is somehow invalid due to the effect of\nHF heating or that the temperature is anisotropic with a\nhigher component along the magnetic field than perpendic-\nular to it. Such anisotropies have been found for ion\ntemperatures under strong natural ion-heating events [e.g.,\nPerraut et al., 1984; L\u00f8vhaug and Fla\u02da, 1986]. This would\nbe surprising since the electron-neutral collision frequency\nis sufficiently high to isotropize the temperature. We can test\nthis hypothesis by looking at the temperatures obtained\nfrom the remote site receivers at Kiruna, Sweden, and\nSodankyla\u00a8, Finland, whose antennas were pointing at the\nTroms\u00f8 beam at 250 km altitude. Figure 7 shows a\nscatterplot of the ratio of electron to ion temperatures\nmeasured at the height of 250 km by the remote sites\nKiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8 for all antenna positions, versus the\nratio measured at Troms\u00f8. Clearly there is no significant\ndifference in the ratio measured between the various sites.\nWhen Troms\u00f8 is measuring along the magnetic field,\nKiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8 measure at 18\u0001 and 28\u0001 away from\nit, respectively. We also investigated the data from 16\nFebruary 1999, the event described by Gustavsson et al.\n[2001], and again found no difference between the temper-\nature data from the three sites. Remote site electron temper-\natures during HF pumping measured by Stocker et al.\n[1992] were also consistent with the Troms\u00f8 data.\n3.4. Electron Density Changes\n[24] HF-induced electron density changes were more\ndifficult to measure than the electron temperature changes\nfor the following reasons. The density is much more\nvariable both in time and space, and the artificial density\nchanges are relatively small, usually less than 20%. This,\ntogether with the long heating cycle and the antenna move-\nments, made the unheated background density profile meas-\nurement often displaced in time by 5\u201310 min from the\nheated profile so that the measurement of the artificial\nperturbation was often unreliable. Nevertheless, after exam-\nining the density perturbations from several profiles it is\npossible to conclude that above about 250 km the density\ndecreases up to 20%, and below this height there may be a\nslight increase of a few percent. These results are slightly\nlarger than but consistent with previous results from Troms\u00f8\n[e.g., Stocker et al., 1992; Honary et al., 1993].\n3.5. Radio-Induced Aurora\n[25] Observations were made by the Digital All-Sky\nImager (DASI) located near Skibotn, 50 km east and south\nof the HF facility [see Kosch et al., 1998, 2000]. The 630\nnm red O(1D) line was imaged with a 50\u0001 lens viewing in\nthe vertical using an interference filter and a 10 s integration\ntime. Optical conditions on 7 October 1999 were mostly\ncloudy at Skibotn, but the cloud thinned sufficiently\nbetween about 1846 and 1856 UT such that radio-induced\naurora could be clearly observed when the HF beam was in\nthe field-aligned position from 1848 to 1856 UT. There is\nalso some weak radio-induced aurora at the start of the 6\u0001\nposition of the HF beam in the 1900 to 1908 UT cycle. The\ndata quality is not good enough to give accurate emission\nintensities, but the position of the radio-induced aurora\nFigure 3. (opposite) Two selected time intervals from 7 October 1999, showing electron density (Ne), ion and electron\ntemperatures (Ti, Te), and ion velocity (Vi) from analyzed Troms\u00f8 long-pulse data for two field-aligned positions.

(b) An interval starting about 3 minutes after HF pump off, showing the background values.\nThe O+ and M+ (molecular ion) densities are from a model.\nSIA 2 - 6 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\nRIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING SIA 2 - 7\nFigure 4. Contour plots of HF-induced electron temperature enhancements on 7 October 1999 for three\npositions of the HF-beam zenith angle, indicated at the top of each plot. Each plot is obtained from the\nanalysis of long-pulse gates for three antenna positions. The centers of the gates are shown by the three\nlines of crosses. The background values which were subtracted from the data were obtained from the\nnearest time without heating but excluding the 6\u0001 position immediately after HF-off since that position\nstill contains a heated plasma. The upper panels show the first four minutes while the lower panels show\nthe second four minutes of each eight-minute HF pulse. The filled circles show the height of the HFIL.\nSIA 2 - 8 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\ncould be determined, as shown by the two images in\nFigure 8. The upper crosses mark the positions of the\nmagnetic field line passing through the HF transmitter and\nintersecting the HF reflection altitude where the light is\nassumed to originate to a first approximation. The lower\ncrosses show the vertical position from Ramfjordmoen. The\nellipses show the \u00013 dB and \u00016 dB contours of the HF\nbeam (for free space) for the two positions. That the free\nspace approximation is reasonable, at least up to the upper\nhybrid resonance height, is shown later. Clearly, the radio-\ninduced aurora patch does not move significantly between\nthe two images even though the HF beam does. These\nobservations support the conclusions given by Kosch et al.\n[2000, 2002b, 2003] that the auroral patch was seen\ndisplaced south of the main region illuminated by the HF\nbeam when it was directed vertically. The fact that the\nelectron temperatures also maximize in the same position as\nthe observed light emission, irrespective of HF beam\ndirection, suggest that the same mechanism, namely upper\nhybrid wave turbulence, is the cause of both phenomena\nand may also be taken as support for the hypothesis that the\nelectron temperature enhancement is the main source of the\nred aurora. On the other hand, other observations [Isham et\nal., 1999a] show that some aspects of Langmuir turbulence,\nwhich is not thought to be the main source of electron\nheating but which may excite energetic electrons, also show\na preference for the field-aligned position. Many aspects of\nthese observations are also not understood [Isham et al.,\n1999a, 1999b].\n3.6. HF Backscatter From Artificial Field-Aligned\nIrregularities\n[26] Heating of the F region plasma causes artificial\nsmall-scale field-aligned irregularities (AFAI) or striations\nto be formed [Fialer, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974]. They have\nscale sizes between about one and several tens of meters.\nDiagnostics of the AFAI were made by two HF coherent\nradar systems.\n3.6.1. HF Bistatic Backscatter\n[27] A bistatic HF Doppler radio scatter experiment, the\ngeometry of which is shown in Figure 1 of Blagoveshchen-\nskaya et al. [1998], was carried out on the London-Troms\u00f8-\nSt. Petersburg path. The analysis of the received diagnostic\nwaves, scattered from AFAI above Troms\u00f8, was made by\nFigure 5. Electron temperature increase as a function of\nradar and HF angle to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\nFigure 6. Electron temperature increase as a function of\nradar angle to the magnetic field, for three different HF-\nbeam directions shown by the arrows. The HF beam is\nabout 12\u0001 wide. The field-aligned radar position usually\nshows the largest enhancements.\nRIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING SIA 2 - 9\nthe Doppler spectral method in St. Petersburg at a distance\nof about 1200 km south of the Troms\u00f8 heating facility.\nSpectral processing of the diagnostic signals was made with\na fast Fourier transform method. The frequency bandwidth\nused was 27 Hz with 256 spectral coefficients allowing a\nfrequency resolution of about 0.1 Hz and temporal reso-\nlution of about 10 s. During the present experiment the bi-\nstatic HF Doppler radio scatter used the 12.095 MHz carrier\nsignal from the BBC transmitter and therefore was sensitive\nto AFAI with spatial scales of 12.4 m perpendicular to the\ngeomagnetic field.\n[28] Figure 9a displays the dynamic Doppler spectra of\nHF diagnostic signals recorded in St. Petersburg in the\ncourse of three heating cycles from 1909 to 1945 UT. There\nwere no backscatter signals observed from 1800 to 1848\nUT. Observations were not made during the last 12 min of\neach hour because of interference from another sounder.\nFrom 1900 UT well-defined scattered signals were\nobserved. Their spectral structure was quite similar to the\nheater-on period 1936\u20131944 UT, but the power was less.\nThis HF-on period was not included in the HF Doppler plot\nbecause there was very strong interference between 1906\nand 1907 UT. The behavior of power was similar to that\nobserved by the CUTLASS Hankasalmi radar (see next\nsection). The HF heater antenna beam was centered along\nvertical pointing (0\u0001), field-aligned (12\u0001) and Spitze angle\n(6\u0001) during the first (1912\u20131920 UT), second (1924\u20131932\nUT), and third (1936\u20131944 UT) heating cycle respectively.\nThe field-aligned scattered signals appear after the heater is\nturned on and disappear after it is turned off. They are\nrecorded as additional tracks on the negative part of Doppler\nsonogram shifted from that of the direct signal propagating\nfrom transmitter to the receiver along a great-cycle path and\ncorresponding to the 0 Hz Doppler frequency. From Figure\n9 it can be seen that signals scattered from AFAI are\nobserved during all pumping cycles from 1909 to 1945\nUT while the spectral structure of these signals depends on\nthe zenith angle of the HF heater antenna beam. A broad-\nening of the Doppler spectra as well as the Doppler\nfrequency shifts of the scattered signals from direct HF\nsignals peaked when the HF beam was centered along the\nfield aligned pointing (12\u0001).\n[29] Figure 9b presents the temporal variations of the\nspectral power and the median values of the Doppler shift of\nthe scattered HF signals calculated from the spectra shown\nin Figure 9a. One can recognize that the power of signals\nscattered from AFAI were also maximal under the heater\nFigure 7. Scatter plot of the electron-to-ion-temperature\nratios measured at the remote sites Kiruna (diamonds) and\nSodankyla\u00a8 (squares) versus the ratio measured at Troms\u00f8.\nThe solid line is the best linear fit to the Kiruna data, the\ndashed line to the Sodankyla\u00a8 data. There is no significant\nbias from equal temperature ratios measured at all sites.\nFigure 8.

The upper white cross marks the intersection\nof the magnetic field line from the HF transmitter with the\n280 km level, while the lower cross is the position overhead\nthe HF facility.

(b) 1900 to 1908 UT, with the\nHF beam tilted 6\u0001 south (Spitze) and an assumed emission\nheight of 300 km.\nSIA 2 - 10 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\nFigure 9. (a) Dynamic Doppler spectra of HF diagnostic signals on the London-Troms\u00f8-St. Petersburg\npath at 12.095 MHz on 7 October 1999 from 1909 to 1945 UT. The direct signals propagating from the\ntransmitter to the receiver along a great circle path correspond to zero Doppler shifts. The intervals\nwhen the Troms\u00f8 HF heater was turned on are marked on the time axis. During the first (1912\u20131920\nUT), second (1924\u20131932 UT) and third (1936\u20131944 UT) heater-on periods the HF heater antenna\nbeam was centered along vertical pointing (0\u0001 zenith angle), field-aligned (12\u0001) and Spitze angle (6\u0001),\nrespectively. (b) Temporal variations of the spectral power (top panel) and median values of Doppler\nfrequency shift (bottom panel) of the scattered HF signals calculated from the dynamic Doppler spectra\nshown in Figure 9a.\nRIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING SIA 2 - 11\nzenith angle of 12\u0001. Therefore the spectral features of the\nscattered signals are strongly dependent on the elevation\nangles of the HF heater antenna beam. The spectral power,\nbroadening of the Doppler spectra, and median values of\nDoppler Shift were maximal during the field aligned direc-\ntion (12\u0001) of the HF beam, whereas they were minimal\nduring the vertical pointing (0\u0001) of the HF beam.\n3.6.2. HF Backscatter From CUTLASS\n[30] The CUTLASS (Cooperative UK Twin Located\nAuroral Sounding System) radar is a pair of HF coherent\nbackscatter radar systems located at Hankasalmi, Finland\nand Pykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland and forms part of the SuperDARN\narray. Details of SuperDARN are given by Greenwald et al.\n[1995] and the CUTLASS systems at Hankasalmi and\nPykkvib\u00e6r by Milan et al. [1997]. CUTLASS is ideally\nsituated for making observations of the power, spectral\nwidth, and Doppler shift of HF-induced AFAI over Troms\u00f8\n[e.g., Bond et al., 1997; Eglitis et al., 1998]. Both Pykkvi-\nb\u00e6r and Hankasalmi were in standard \u2018\u2018common time\u2019\u2019\noperations, with 45 km range gates, with the first range\ngate starting at a range of 180 km. Each beam was sampled\nfor 7 s, with a full 16 beam scan being collected every 2\nmin. The radar frequencies were set for natural scatter, i.e.,\nnot optimized for the observation of heating effects over\nTroms\u00f8, with both Hankasalmi and Pykkvib\u00e6r set at 10.0\nMHz after 1800 UT. Nevertheless the HF-induced back-\nscatter was strong enough to be clearly distinguished on\nboth radars. Figure 10 shows the backscattered power for\nthe particular range and beam from each radar which\ncovered the heated region.\n[31] The Hankasalmi observations of artificial irregular-\nities were colocated with ground scatter, but in spite of this\nenhanced power is visible up to 10 dB above that seen in the\nground scatter for at least six heater on cycles. Pykkvib\u00e6r\nobservations are clearer, as no natural ionospheric or ground\nscatter was observed at the range of Troms\u00f8, and the heater\non periods raise the returned backscatter power up to 20 dB\nabove the power observed during heater off periods. Exami-\nnation of the angle of arrival of the Pykkvib\u00e6r backscatter\nreveals it to have elevation angles of \u000330\u0001. This, and the\nrange gate in which it is received, indicate that it is detected\nvia a 2.5 hop HF propagation path as has been reported\nbefore [Yeoman et al., 2001].\n[32] There does not seem to be any clear dependence of\nthe Iceland backscatter on the HF beam direction, apart\nfrom the strongest backscatter being seen at 1850 UT when\nthe HF was pointed field-aligned. In the Finland data there\nseems to be a clearer pattern. The backscatter at 1930 UT\n(HF field-aligned) is stronger than at any other time, and\ncorrelates with the strong backscatter seen by the St.\nPetersburg diagnostic for that HF position. The backscatter\nat 1905 UT and 1940 UT (6\u0001 positions) is stronger than for\nthe two positions where the HF is at 0\u0001 (1915 and 1950\nUT). This also agrees with the St. Petersburg data in Figure\n9 where the backscatter from 1937 to 1945 UT is stronger\nthan 1912 to 1921 UT, the 0\u0001 position.\n[33] Comparing the CUTLASS backscatter power with\nthe data from EISCAT in Figure 1, we see that the onset\nof backscatter is correlated with both a general increase in\nthe height of the HF-pump reflection height, as well as\nwith a simultaneous increase in the electron temperature\nenhancement.\n[34] In an independent study, Dhillon [2001] also found\nthat the highest CUTLASS backscatter powers occurred to\nthe south of the center of the heated patch, corresponding to\nthe heater beam pointing in the field-aligned direction,\nindicating that field-aligned irregularities are generated most\neffectively in this direction.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Field-Aligned Electron Temperatures and\nIon Flows\n[35] Modeling of the electron temperature enhancements\ncaused by Ohmic heating was done by Meltz and LeLevier\n[1970] for the midlatitude case and by Shoucri et al. [1984]\nand Hansen et al. [1992] for the high-latitude ionosphere.\nComparisons of models with experimental data were made\nby Mantas et al. [1981], Newman et al. [1988], and Hansen\net al. [1992] for the midlatitude case and by Robinson\n[1989], Stocker et al. [1992], Sergienko et al. [2000], and\nGustavsson et al. [2001] for the high-latitude cases, respec-\ntively. Modeling of the development and propagation of\nelectron temperature and density perturbations along the\nmagnetic field line has been done by Vas\u2019kov et al. [1993]\nfor the midlatitude ionosphere and by Mingaleva and\nMingalev [1997] for the high-latitude situation. They predict\nion outflows along the magnetic field caused by the electron\nheating, but to our knowledge they have not been reported\nbefore now. The physical mechanism is an increase of\nplasma pressure gradient caused by the electron heating\nwhich accelerates the plasma upwards. Detailed compari-\nsons with the models are not attempted here but should be\nperformed in the future.\n4.2. Comparison With Other Observations at Troms\u00f8\n[36] One other case of large temperature enhancement\nassociated with radio-induced aurora has been studied,\nFigure 10. Backscattered power from the Pykkvib\u00e6r\n(Iceland) and Hankasalmi (Finland) CUTLASS HF back-\nscatter radars at 10 MHz on 7 October 1999. The beam and\nrange correspond to the heated region above Troms\u00f8. Both\nground scatter and ionospheric scatter were observed at\nHankasalmi. The numbers on the plot indicate the zenith\nangles of the HF-pump beam at Troms\u00f8.\nSIA 2 - 12 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\nnamely that of 16 February 1999 [Leyser et al., 2000;\nSergienko et al., 2000; Gustavsson et al., 2001]. In their\ncase the radar measured constantly along the geomagnetic\nfield while the HF beam was directed 6\u0001 south. The\ntemporal development of the temperature changes are\nclearer in their case since the antenna beams remained\nstationary. Figure 3 of Sergienko et al. [2000] shows how\nthe time constant of heating varies with height. Figure 1 of\nSergienko et al. [2000] and Plate 8 of Gustavsson et al.\n[2001] show clearly how the temperature enhancement\npropagates upward along the field line. This would appear\nto be a solitary ion-acoustic compression wave that prop-\nagates along the magnetic flux tube from the heated region,\nas modeled for the Arecibo case by Vas\u2019kov et al. [1993].\n[37] We think that the large temperature increase observed\nin the nighttime experiments compared to the daytime results\n[e.g., Stocker et al., 1992; Honary et al., 1993] should be\nprimarily attributed to the higher altitudes at night where the\nelectron-neutral collision frequencies and therefore the heat\nlosses are significantly lower. In all these results there\nremains the question as to how realistic are the measured\ntemperatures. The incoherent scatter analysis assumes a\nuniform, Maxwellian plasma within the scattering volume.\nIn some of the theories [e.g., Gurevich et al., 1995] the\nstriations contain plasma with very high electron temper-\natures with larger volumes between the striations with almost\nbackground temperatures. What does the incoherent scatter\ntechnique measure in this case? Gurevich et al. [1998]\nconsidered this question and suggested that when fitting\nonly electron temperature, the mean square error of the fit\nshould increase if strong heating in striations occurred. All\nwe can say at present is that the residuals of the fits used to\nobtain the parameters in Figures 1 to 4 did not differ between\nthe HF-heated and unheated times, but in our analysis all\nfour standard parameters (electron density and temperature;\nion temperature and velocity) were allowed to be fitted.\nClearly, we need further studies to test the method of\nGurevich et al. [1998] and perhaps new measurement\ntechniques to resolve these issues.\n4.3. HF-Ray Geometry\n[38] The angle that the HF pump wave vector makes with\nthe geomagnetic field is critical in determining the amount\nof HF energy available to excite AFAI. Only the component\nof the HF electric field that is perpendicular to the geo-\nmagnetic field (E?) near the upper hybrid resonance level\ncontributes to the excitation of the artificial field-aligned\nirregularities. For this reason it has been argued that\nanomalous heating effects and the associated AFAI are\ndominant at high latitudes where a vertically incident high\npower electromagnetic wave propagates at small angles to\nthe magnetic field [Robinson, 1989]. To try to understand\nour results in detail we performed some ray tracing of the\nradio waves.\n[39] The F region electron density profile was approxi-\nmated by a parabolic function centered on 310 km with a\nwidth of 65 km. Ray tracing was done by calculating the\nBooker quartic [Budden, 1985] in 500 steps for each\nincident wave. The critical frequency was 4.9 MHz.\nFigure 11 shows a selection of ray paths with varying\nangles of incidence from the HF facility. The long-dash\nline shows the upper hybrid layer which is the height at\nwhich the HF pump frequency equals ( fp\n2 + fc\n2)1\/2 where\nfp is the plasma frequency and fc is the gyro frequency. As\ncan be seen from the figure, the dependence of E? on HF\nincident angle is very weak (a cosine dependence on\nangle of incidence) and cannot explain the strong depend-\nence of temperature on HF angle.\n[40] Figure 11 also shows that the ionosphere does not\ncause the HF wave to deviate very much from the free space\npath for rays incident with southward angles. The deviation\nfrom free space propagation is also minimal up to the UHR\nheight for northward angles. This provides support for the\nmapping of the HF beam to near the reflection height in\nFigure 8 assuming free space propagation and a smooth,\nhorizontally stratified ionosphere.\n[41] A simple explanation for the southward bias may be\nthe existence of a horizontal gradient in the electron density\n(as is natural near sunset) causing a tilt of our horizontally\nuniform ionosphere. For example, if the density gradient\nwould be tilted 12\u0001 south instead of vertical, a wave trans-\nmitted field-aligned (and along the density gradient) would\npropagate up and down along the same path, thereby\nforming a standing wave pattern and have maximum\nelectric field perpendicular to the magnetic field (to excite\nupper hybrid phenomena). Whatever the angle to the\ndensity gradient is, the standing wave pattern would be less\nsmeared out the smaller the angle is between the transmitted\nHF wave vector and the density gradient.\n[42] There were indeed horizontal gradients during this\nexperiment, as can be seen by examining the electron\ndensity panels of Figures 1 and 2, but they were of different\nsigns at different times. Before about 1850 UT the peak\ndensities for the 13\u0001 south UHF antenna positions were\nlower than for overhead giving a northward tilt, whereas\nafterwards they were higher, resulting in a southward tilt.\nCalculations of the tilt at the upper-hybrid resonance height\nusing the density profiles for the three positions gave\nabsolute values typically between about 12\u0001 to 16\u0001 for both\nsigns. Support for the ionospheric tilt explanation is given\nby the fact that the electron temperature enhancements\nalong the field-aligned position seem to be much stronger\nthan for the other positions after 1850 UT than before. The\nradio-induced aurora images in Figure 8 were also taken\nafter 1850 UT. Nevertheless, the fact that the tilts were of\ndifferent signs at different times argues against this explan-\nation to explain the general trend. It is necessary to examine\nthe relationship between ionospheric tilts and southward\nbiases in HF pump-induced effects in much greater detail in\nthe future.\n[43] Another phenomenon which may be closely related\nis the observation by one of the authors (MTR, unpublished\ndata) that natural ionospheric echoes from an HF sounder\n(NOAA dynasonde) located at the EISCAT facilities often\nshow a southward bias close to the local magnetic field-line.\nTo the authors\u2019 knowledge this effect is unexplained, and\nwhether it is related to ionospheric tilts or multiple scatter-\ning off irregularities or both is under investigation.\n4.4. Other Possible Explanations\n[44] Another possible explanation for the directional\ndependence of the heating effects discussed here may be\nfound by investigating the redistribution of electromagnetic\nenergy density caused by multiple scattering of the HF\nRIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING SIA 2 - 13\nwaves by intermediate scale (0.1\u20131 km) irregularities. Such\nscattering has been used to explain anomalous attenuation\nof HF waves and its directional dependence [Zabotin et al.,\n1998, 2002; Zabotin and Kovalenko, 1999].\n[45] The minutes-long heating cycles used in this experi-\nment will also cause large scale changes in the electron\ndensity distribution which could cause nonlinear refraction\neffects as discussed by Hansen et al. [1992]. Self-focusing\neffects [e.g., Bernhardt and Duncan, 1982] may also be\nimportant. Whether these can explain a southward bias of\nthe observed effects is open to further research, but we note\nthat Hansen et al. [1992] found that nonlinear refraction\nresulted in a northward shift of the most heated region for\nthe Arecibo case, which is opposite to what we find.\nNevertheless, the effects of HF-induced electron density\nchanges on the refractive index surfaces for the high-latitude\ncase should be examined.\n[46] A promising explanation seems to be self-focusing of\nthe HF wave caused by the density depletions within the\nstriations, as examined by Gurevich et al. [2001] to explain\nthe southward bias in HF-induced airglow. In this model\nstriations are formed which trap upper-hybrid waves in the\ndirection perpendicular to the magnetic field leading to\nelectron energization and an overall density depletion within\nthe striations.\n[47] In the model of Istomin and Leyser [2001] there is a\ndiffraction of the HF wave on the small-scale striations.\nWhether development of this theory can explain the pref-\nerence for rays propagating along the magnetic field to be\nmore unstable to upper-hybrid turbulence remains to be\nseen.\n[48] If these models with enhanced temperatures inside\nstriations apply, then one has to ask how the electron\ntemperature and density measured by the incoherent scatter\ntechnique, which assumes a uniform plasma in thermal\nequilibrium within the scattering volume (several kilometers\nin both diameter and in height), relate to the actual values\nwhich vary by a large factor between the volume within the\nstriations and that outside. In a simplistic approach one\nmight think that our incoherent scatter results are an average\nfor the volume measured which would imply that the actual\nelectron temperatures within the striations were 10000 K or\nmore.\n5. Conclusions\n[49] Electron temperature enhancements of up to 3000 K\ninduced by powerful HF pumping at night in the quiet high-\nlatitude ionosphere have been measured. They spread along\nthe field line up to the highest measured altitude of nearly\n600 km. Associated with them are field-aligned ion out-\nflows of up to several hundred meters per second. The ion\ntemperature changes by only a few hundred Kelvin and\nsmall electron density depletions of up to 20% occur near\nthe interaction height. The electron temperature enhance-\nments induced by powerful HF pumping show a strong\ndependence on the angle of the HF pumping waves to the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. The strongest effects are for rays\npropagating near parallel to the magnetic field. This is\nconsistent with observations of HF-induced aurora seen in\nthe 630 nm (O1D) line which is also preferentially excited\nby HF rays in the same direction. There are indications from\nindependent HF backscatter radars that meter-scale field-\naligned irregularities also produce stronger backscatter\nwhen pumping in the magnetic field-aligned direction.\nElectron heating, probably 630 nm radio-induced aurora,\nanomalous absorption, and striation formation are all\nthought to be produced through upper-hybrid wave turbu-\nlence which is excited by pump electric fields perpendicular\nto the geomagnetic field. Such a strong dependence of\nupper-hybrid related phenomena on HF aspect angle is\nunexpected and not understood.\n[50] Possible explanations for this angular dependence\nare ionospheric tilts, multiple scattering off small-scale\nirregularities, or self-focusing or diffraction of the HF waves\non field-aligned striations causing the energy to be distrib-\nFigure 11. Schematic diagram of ray tracing HF waves of varying angles of incidence into a\nhorizontally uniform ionosphere. The ionospheric electron density profile is shown by the curved dotted\nline and relates to the upper X-axis, which is normalised to the pump frequency of 4.544 MHz. The\nreflection height and upper-hybrid resonance (UHR) heights are shown labeled and the wave electric field\ndirection of the upward and downward going waves at the UHR height are shown by arrows. The\nmagnetic field direction is shown as a dash-dotted line. Efficient HF-induced heating is expected where\nthe wave electric field is perpendicular to the magnetic field such that coupling to upper-hybrid waves is\nmost efficient.\nSIA 2 - 14 RIETVELD ET AL.: ANGULAR DEPENDENCE OF HF IONOSPHERIC HEATING\nuted asymmetrically. There is evidence that ionospheric tilts\nexisted during these observations but how important they\nare is unclear.\n[51] To better measure the range of optimum coupling\nangles it is desirable to repeat such scanning experiments\nusing a narrower HF beam, for example using array 1\n(sometimes termed \u2018\u2018superheater\u2019\u2019) of the Troms\u00f8 facility,\nand scanning the UHF antenna in smaller steps and beyond\nthe field-aligned position. Further measurements of iono-\nspheric tilts and studies of their effect on ionospheric\nheating are necessary. It would be interesting to see whether\nother spectral lines of artificially excited optical emissions\nand the stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE) phe-\nnomenon also exhibit a directional dependence like many of\nthe effects discussed here. This, together with experiments\nwhich determine the gyrofrequency dependence of the\nvarious auroral emissions, should help determine which\nmechanism is responsible for the various phenomena.\n[52] Acknowledgments.
