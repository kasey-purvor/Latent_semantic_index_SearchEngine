INTRODUCTION\nFUZZY logic, or the use of fuzzy sets, allows uncertain orinexact concepts to be represented. They derive from a\ngrouping of elements into classes that do not possess sharply\ndefined boundaries [1], [2]. Fuzzy set theory [3], on which\nfuzzy controllers are based, allows imprecise and qualitative\ninformation to be expressed in a quantitative manner. Over\nthe years, fuzzy logic techniques have been applied to a wide\nrange of systems, with many electronic control systems in the\nautomotive industry, such as automatic transmission, engine\ncontrol and antilock braking systems (ABSs) currently being\npursued, particularly in the United States. These electronically\ncontrolled automotive systems realize superior characteristics\nthrough the use of fuzzy-logic-based control, rather than\ntraditional control algorithms [4]. Moreover, since fuzzy logic\nManuscript received July 2, 2002; revised May 2, 2003.\nP. Khatun, deceased, was with TH!NK Technologies, Ford Motor Company.\nC. M. Bingham and N. Schofield are with the Department. of Electronic and\nElectrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, S1 3JD Sheffield, U.K. (e-mail:\nc.bingham@sheffield.ac.uk).\nP. H. Mellor is with the Industrial Electronics Group, University of Bristol,\nBristol, U.K.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TVT.2003.815922\ncontrollers deal with inexactness in a rigorous manner, they\nare effective at handling the uncertainties and nonlinearities\nassociated with complex control systems such as traction\ncontrol and antilock braking.\nABSs aim to control the wheel slip at an optimum value\nthat can provide maximum tractive force during heavy braking.\nHowever, there are many complicating factors, especially for\ncurrent IC-engined vehicles, where the brake torque at the wheel\nis nonlinearly related to the temperature of the brake linings,\nand the viscosity of the brake fluid changes with temperature\nand influences the rate at which brake pressure can be increased\nor decreased. An ABS or traction system must also be capable\nof coping with factors such as changes in road surfaces, ve-\nhicle loading, and steering. Moreover, wear patterns of braking\ncomponents may disturb wheel speed sensors, and the variation\nin the adhesion of brake linings, brake hysteresis, tire inflation\npressure, tire wear, and other external factors must be accom-\nmodated.\nThe design of model-based ABS or traction control (TC)\nschemes (along with those designed empirically) therefore tend\nto be nonlinear and time varying, and are complicated by the\ninclusion of high-order terms in the transfer functions. Also,\nto-date, a feature of many TC\/ABSs for commercial IC-engine\nvehicles is that the realizable performance is often limited\nby the mechanical bandwidth of the active actuation systems\n(typically 20 Hz for ABS).\nHowever, with the advent of electrically powered vehicles\ninto the marketplace, the means for controlling drive-torque at\nmuch greater bandwidths is possible, with the torque produced\nby the electric motor being directly proportional to phase cur-\nrent [5]. Hence, some of the difficulties attributed to mechanical\nsystems can be inherently addressed.\nA further key obstacle to the development of robust ABS\/TC\nhas traditionally been the real-time estimation of the wheel-slip\nversus adhesion-coefficient characteristics for different tire\ntypes and road surface conditions [6]. Recent studies have\ninvestigated the application of observer\/estimation schemes to\nobtain real-time data indirectly, with the extended Kalman filter\n(EKF) receiving particular attention [7]. However, published\nmaterial to date is primarily derived from simulation studies,\nwith practical implementation and validation of the techniques\nrare. Current commercial\/passenger vehicles incorporating\nABS\/TC systems often employ lookup tables that are based\non the results of experimental trials, and have been shown to\nprovide adequate performance under many driving situations.\nThis technique, however, is limited by the fixed structure of the\ncontrol strategy, and is often \u201cdetuned\u201d to accommodate worst\n0018-9545\/03$17.00 \u00a9 2003 IEEE\nKHATUN et al.: FUZZY CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ANTILOCK SYSTEMS 1357\nFig. 1. Wheel model [8].\ncase scenarios, for example, traction control in icy conditions\nwith old tires. Consequently, suboptimal wheel-slip charac-\nteristics are imposed for most driving conditions. Although\nthis constitutes the safest criteria to adopt for design purposes,\nit can impose conservative limits on the traction available\nunder higher surface conditions. Hence, maximum benefits\nof the traction controller are often not realized due to the\nclassical control strategies used for design. The application of\nfuzzy-logic-based control algorithms is therefore investigated\nand discussed in this paper, along with a review of how to em-\nploy such methodologies to develop more robust and efficient\nABS\/traction control systems.\nII. TRACTION CONTROL\/ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEMS\nThe tractive force between a tire and the road surface (Fig. 1)\nis proportional to the normal load , the constant of propor-\ntionality being termed the adhesion coefficient . The adhesion\ncoefficient is the ratio of tire brake force at the tire road inter-\nface and the normal load acting on the tire\n(1)\nThe value of is highly dependent on tire characteristics\n(compound, wear, aging, etc.) and road surface conditions (dry,\nicy, gravel, tarmac, etc.), although it can be primarily regarded as\na function of the relative slip between the two contacting sur-\nfaces. By definition, slip is the normalized difference between\nthe wheel speed and vehicle speed at the contact point\n(2)\nwhere is the vehicle velocity, is the effective radius of the\ndriven wheel, and is the angular velocity of the wheel. Typical\n- characteristics are shown in Fig. 2.\nIt is clear from Fig. 2 that increasing slip can increase the\ntractive force between the tire and road surface by virtue of an\nincrease in . However, once the peak of the characteristic\nis encountered, any further increase in slip will reduce traction\nand consequently induce an unstable acceleration of the wheel\nuntil the drive torque is reduced.\nThe objective of an ABS is to manipulate the torque applied\nto the driven wheels in order to limit the slip between the road\nsurface and the tire, and consequently, only operate within the\nstable region of the - characteristic. A major obstacle in the\npractical design of ABS control schemes is the determination, in\nreal time, of - characteristics, i.e., and . For example,\nTable I shows typical values of slip required to obtain the max-\nimum adhesion coefficient for various road conditions.\nFig. 2. Example \u0016-slip characteristics for various road conditions [9].\nTABLE I\nMAX VALUES OF \u0016 FOR VARIOUS ROAD SURFACES [9]\nFig. 3. DSP-based experimental test facilities.\nTo overcome this problem, many manufacturers employ a\nslip-limiting control scheme to account for \u201cworst case\u201d con-\nditions, typically icy roads. Although this constitutes the safest\ncriteria to adopt for design purposes, it can impose conservative\nlimits on the traction available under less severe conditions [10].\nA second obstacle often encountered by designers of TC\/ABS\nschemes is the availability of appropriate test-tracks\/skid-pans\nor other experimental rolling road facilities to evaluate proposed\nalgorithms and provide repeatable conditions for comparative\nstudies.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL TEST FACILITY\nTo develop the fuzzy control algorithms, a low-cost experi-\nmental test bench is employed. The test facility, illustrated in\nFig. 3, is composed of an electric traction drive connected to a\nstandard three-phase induction machine, which is used to mimic\nthe road load.\nThe experimental electric traction drive is a 6-kW continuous,\n12-kW peak rated brushless permanent magnet motor supplied\nvia a power controller from a 72-V high-performance nickel\ncadmium traction battery. The power electronic controller is\nconstructed using three independent MOSFET\/IGBT H-bridges\n1358 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 52, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2003\nFig. 4. Induction machine torque-slip characteristics.\n[11] and is capable of full four-quadrant operation. The elec-\ntrical machine and power converter has a combined efficiency\nof 92% at rated power. In the prototype electric vehicle, the trac-\ntion motor is connected to the wheels via a step-down gearstage.\nHowever, for the proposed test-bench, the brushless permanent\nmagnet motor is directly coupled to a 2.2-kW 50-Hz three-phase\nsix-pole induction machine, with the angular velocity of the con-\nnecting shaft being monitored via an optical shaft encoder inter-\nface. The induction motor is connected to the utility supply via\na variac, allowing the supply voltage to be adjusted. To facilitate\nthe implementation of the developed control schemes, a custom\nstate-of-the-art digital signal-processing (DSP) hardware plat-\nform has been designed, based on the TMS320C31 floating-\npoint processor, to integrate the system control algorithms with\nsensor interfaces, man\u2013machine interfaces, monitoring, and su-\npervisory tasks. A foreground\/background distribution of \u201cnon-\ntime-critical\u201d and \u201ctime-critical\u201d functions is employed to en-\nsure the controller remains a high-integrity process.\nThe key operating principle of the proposed test facility for\nTC\/ABS investigations is based on the correspondence between\n- characteristics of tire\/road interactions (Fig. 2) and the\ntorque-slip characteristics of the induction machine when oper-\nated as a generator (Fig. 4). In line with convention, induction\nmachine slip is shown in terms of per-unit (p.u.) values, with\nreference to the synchronous frequency , and provides a\nnatural analogy with the definition of tire-road slip; see Fig. 5.\nThe brushless permanent magnet (PM) motor acts as the\nprime mover and drives the induction machine into the gen-\nerator region of operation, thereby inducing a negative slip\nwith respect to synchronous speed (1000 rpm in this case). As\nthe torque demand to the PM machine is raised further, the\nslip becomes increasingly negative, and the induction machine\ndevelops an opposing torque, eventually resulting in a stable\nsteady-state condition.\nThis procedure can continue up to the pushover torque limit of\nthe induction machine. A subsequent increase in applied torque\nwill then further decrease the slip and force the system into an\nunstable operating regime where the induction machine is not\nable to oppose the applied torque, and a runaway condition is\nencountered with the brushless motor accelerating uncontrol-\nFig. 5. Fuzzy-logic-based traction control scheme.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 6. Membership functions for (a) observed load torque and (b) slip.\nlably. This is analogous to the classical - characteristics en-\ncountered in traction control systems when the slip at is\nexceeded. An algorithm that automatically controls the torque\ndeveloped by the brushless PM motor to maintain the induction\nmachine in the \u201cstable-slip\u201d region of operation is therefore also\nlikely to be a good candidate to control the torque applied to the\nwheels of an electric vehicle to maintain tractive force in the\nstable region of the - characteristic. The torque-slip charac-\nteristic can be obtained from the standard equivalent circuit of\nan induction machine\n(3)\nKHATUN et al.: FUZZY CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ANTILOCK SYSTEMS 1359\nFig. 7.

FUZZY LOGIC ABS\/TRACTION CONTROL\nTo address the aforementioned issues, a fuzzy-based method-\nology is employed to develop control algorithms. One of the\nstrengths of fuzzy systems is their ability to express a confidence\nin reasoning results. Recent studies have shown that fuzzy sys-\ntems are part of a universal class of approximators of continuous\nfunctions.\nThe key advantage of fuzzy control is that there are many\ninstances where TRUE and FALSE or ON and OFF fail to describe\na given situation. These cases require a sliding scale where\nvariables can be measured as PARTLY ON or MOSTLY TRUE and\nPARTLY FALSE [4].\nTraditional set theory is based on bivalent logic where an ob-\nject either is a member of a set or is not. However, with fuzzy\nlogic, an object can be a member of multiple sets with a dif-\nferent degree of membership in each set. A degree of member-\nship in a set is based on a scale from 0 to 1, with \u201c1\u201d being\ncomplete membership and \u201c0\u201d being no membership. Hence, by\napplying fuzzy logic control to this discrete-time traction con-\nKHATUN et al.: FUZZY CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE ANTILOCK SYSTEMS 1361\n(e) (f)\nFig. 14. (Continued.)

Again, with reference to Fig. 5, the depicted observer\nis essentially a discrete-time filter that compares measured in-\nformation at its inputs with model-based calculated data of the\nobserved process, to provide convergent estimates of otherwise\nunmeasurable system states. In this case, observing the load\ntorque presented to the induction machine is analogous to\nestimating the tractive force between the tire and the road sur-\nface on a vehicle, and hence, is directly related to . A detailed\naccount of the design of the observer for this type of system,\nin the digital domain, is given in [14]. Given that slip is readily\nmeasurable, the role of the observer is to facilitate the determi-\nnation of when the pushover torque (or, equivalently, on\na vehicle) is exceeded, based only on measurements of slip and\ndemanded torque. This condition depicts the transition between\nthe stable and unstable regions of the - characteristic and is\nobtained by noting the occurrence of a sign change of .\nUpon a transition into the unstable region, the torque demand\nis reduced until operation in the stable region is again detected,\nat which time the demanded torque is once again allowed to be\ndeveloped. In this manner, the characteristically high bandwidth\nafforded by the electric traction system allows the ABS\/traction\ncontroller to operate about the peak of the - characteristic,\nirrespective of driving conditions. Detecting the transition be-\ntween the stable and unstable regions, however, is hindered by\nmeasurement noise and modeling error when designing the ob-\nserver and presents a key driver for employing fuzzy-based con-\ntrol techniques for this application.\nThe system inputs are therefore exposed to three key trans-\nformations before becoming a system output, as shown in\nFig. 5, which includes the transformation process of fuzzifica-\ntion, fuzzy rule association, and defuzzification.\nTo establish the two appropriate input fuzzy membership\nfunctions and the rule base, a thorough investigation of the\nABS braking process has been undertaken. In this case, the rate\nof change of observed load torque and the rate of change of\nslip are chosen and are fuzzified into membership functions, as\nshown in Fig. 6(a) and (b).\nInitially, Gaussian functions have been employed to investi-\ngate the ABS braking process; however, experimental trials have\nultimately shown that functions based on polysigmoid curves\ncan provide enhanced performance characteristics.\nFor the slip, the universe of discourse was chosen between 0\nand 100%, since during the operation of an induction machine at\nzero slip the system is stable and at 100% the system is unstable.\nThis is analogous to the braking process of a vehicle, where a\nwheel can rotate freely with slip at zero or be locked at slip equal\nto one.\nBoth inputs, slip and observed load torque, are fuzzified into\ntwo membership functions. A smaller number of membership\nfunctions causes less sensitive control, but better computation\nspeed, and vice versa. Therefore, it is very important to under-\nstand and test the influence of the number of membership func-\ntions, as a compromise always exists between execution speed\nand sensitivity of the fuzzy controller.\nFor testing purposes, the fuzzy-logic-based traction control\nscheme simply has two inputs (slip and load torque) to the con-\ntroller and one output (torque demand), with four possible rules.\n1362 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 52, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2003\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 15. Simulation and measured results between 33- and 70-V phase voltage, which models a vehicle travelling from an icy to a dry road surface.\nAll four rules are used for the controller and are determined\nfrom the fuzzy rule map shown in Fig. 7. The four rules cover\neach state of input combinations (p: positive, n: negative, ps:\npositive small, and ns: negative small) during the braking\nprocess. The output (z: zero or pb: positive big) of the fuzzy\ncontroller is the torque demand (or, in the case of a vehicle, the\ntractive force).

A fuzzy controller consists of fuzzifi-\ncation, rulebase, and defuzzification procedures. Fuzzification,\nthat is, creating fuzzy inputs from crisp inputs, is accomplished\nusing the membership functions in Fig. 6(a) and (b).

RESULTS\nThe fuzzy control scheme has been implemented with an ex-\nperimental setup (at 60-V phase voltage) analogous to a ve-\nhicle travelling on a dry road surface. Fig. 9 shows the simu-\nlated performance of the system. By comparison with classical\n\u201cbang-bang\u201d slip control schemes, where the slip is generally\nlimited to 0.1 p.u. for dry surfaces [12], it can be seen that the\nfuzzy scheme automatically adapts the slip control algorithm,\nidentifies the unstable region of the torque-slip curve and re-\nduces the slip. Eventually the slip stabilizes at 0.25 p.u., which\nis similar to the - characteristic of a dry road surface (where\nthe peak slip is between 0.25 and 0.35 p.u.).\nHowever, without fine \u201ctuning\u201d of the fuzzy controller, the\nsystem can be shown to be unstable at lower phase voltages (35\nV), analogous to a very icy road surface conditions at 0.1 p.u.\nslip (Fig. 10).\nHence, some \u201ctuning\u201d of the input and output membership\nfunctions (Figs. 11 and 12), e.g., by perturbing the membership\nfunctions, is required; the controller hence being optimized for\nlower values of adhesion. This is shown graphically on the three-\ndimensional surface mesh plot of Fig. 13, where an increase in\nthe distribution of Section A provides a more robust controller.\nAs a result, the fuzzy controller is further tuned to ensure op-\ntimum control for a vehicle travelling on low surfaces (or 33-V\ninduction machine phase voltage), which is demonstrated by the\nresults in Fig. 14, that depict both simulated and measured data,\nrespectively (in each case, the upper subfigure relates to sim-\nulated results while the lower corresponds to measured data).\nFrom Fig. 14(b), it can be seen the demanded drive train shaft\ntorque of 12 Nm (maximum) was developed by the PM brush-\nless machine by connection to the induction machine load. Fur-\nthermore, results shown in Fig. 14(c) demonstrate that the fuzzy\ncontroller\u2019s robustness is sufficient to keep the induction ma-\nchine from operating in the unstable torque-slip region, espe-\ncially at low values of adhesion. It is notable that the measured\nload torque [Fig. 14(d)] was derived from the measured phase\ncurrent, using the relationship , where the constant is\ngiven by 0.23 Nm\/A. Finally, Fig. 14(e) illustrates the observed\ntorque that is derived by the discrete time-based observer [13],\nwhose characteristics show a similar dynamic response as that\nof the measured load torque.\nTo provide dynamic - characteristics to simulate a wide\nrange of road conditions, real-time variation of phase voltage ap-\nplied to the induction machine can be employed. Consequently,\nit is possible to observe the fuzzy load torque (or ) over a time\nperiod of 5 s, while the phase voltage is varied between 33 and\n70 V (Fig. 15). This transient is analogous to the vehicle travel-\nling from an icy road surface to a dry road surface. It can be seen\nthat operation transfers from an observed torque ( 2.2 Nm) re-\nlating to an equivalent for icy conditions to a torque (\nNm) relating to an equivalent for a dry road surface. The\noscillations shown in Fig. 15(d) are indicative of the repetitive\ntransfer between the stable and unstable regions of the - char-\nacteristic, about , driven purely from information provided\nby the observer, and the high-frequency modulation of the phase\nvoltage used as a means of controlling torque demand (analo-\ngous to controlling the torque developed at the driven wheels of\na vehicle) [Fig. 15(a)] derived from fuzzy scheme.\nThus, from the measured data, it can be seen that the incor-\nporation of the fuzzy-based discrete-time observation technique\nallows the dynamic - characteristics to be obtained without\na-priori knowledge of .\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA key aim of the research has been to establish a practical\nunderstanding of the ability of fuzzy logic schemes to control\nABSs with significant, time-varying nonlinear dynamics. From\nthe results, it can be clearly seen that the fuzzy controller is ca-\npable of compensating for the complex nonlinear behavior. The\nrobustness of the fuzzy controller has ultimately been shown\nto be impressive, with the ability to adjust to varying road sur-\nfaces being demonstrated. Additionally, the results suggest that\nfuzzy-logic-based ABS\/traction control could substantially im-\nprove longitudinal performance and offer significant potential\nfor optimal control of driven wheels, particularly in icy road\nconditions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the U.K. Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council for providing a re-\nsearch studentship for P.
