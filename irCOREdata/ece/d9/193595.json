Williams2*\nRobert Koch Institut, Wernigerode, Germany,1 and Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom2\nReceived 21 February 2005\/Returned for modification 4 April 2005\/Accepted 25 March 2006\nThe addition of the enterobacterial autoinducer of growth to nutrient-poor minimal medium markedly\naccelerated the exponential growth rates of strains of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli but had little or no\neffect on maximal cell densities in stationary phase. Growth in the presence of the autoinducer resulted in an\napproximately twofold enhancement in Shiga toxin production.\nMammalian signaling molecules such as the catecholamine\nneuroendocrine hormone L-norepinephrine (NE) can stimu-\nlate the growth of a number of pathogenic bacteria and, in\nsome cases, the expression of virulence properties (1, 2, 6, 7, 9,\n10, 12, 17). In addition, transient exposure of Escherichia coli\nto NE in a serum-containing minimal medium induced the\nproduction of a heat-stable autoinducer of growth (AI), which\nelicited responses similar to those with NE, including induction\nof more AI (11). Similar effects were later observed for a range\nof enterobacterial species (4). In the case of E. coli, the mech-\nanism of growth stimulation by NE includes facilitation of iron\nacquisition from the mammalian iron-binding proteins trans-\nferrin and lactoferrin (5). However, the activity of AI is not\nconfined to bacterial growth under the iron-limited conditions\nof a serum-containing medium. We recently demonstrated re-\nsuscitation by enterobacterial AI of highly stressed populations\nof pathogenic isolates of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC)\nand Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in iron-contain-\ning nutrient-rich media (16). AI also enhanced the sensitivity\nand speed of enrichment of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthra-\ncis spores in both serum-supplemented medium and buffered\npeptone water (15). The present paper provides another ex-\nample of iron-independent AI activity, with important practical\nimplications for the detection of Shiga toxin-producing EHEC\nstrains.\nA new nutrient-poor minimal medium (NPMM) formula-\ntion that avoids the use of antibiotics and bile salts as selective\nsupplements has been developed for enrichment of EHEC\nfrom clinical, food, and environmental samples (W. Voigt, A.\nFruth, H.-H. Sonneborn, H. Tscha\u00a8pe, and R. Reissbrodt, Ab-\nstr. VTEC 2003 Meet., p. 149, 2003). This medium comprises\n100 mM K2HPO4 (pH 7.2\u0002 0.1) containing trace elements (40\nmg\/liter of MgSO4 \u00b7 7H2O, 4 mg\/liter of ferric ammonium\ncitrate, 6 mg\/liter of MnSO4 \u00b7 4H2O), vitamins (0.2 mg\/liter\n[each] of pyridoxal-HCl, thiamine, and nicotinic acid amide),\nand pancreatic casein peptone (0.2% [wt\/vol]) as a source of\namino acids (14). During developmental work, it was observed\nthat aspartate, glutamate, and serine were significantly de-\npleted during the growth of EHEC strains, as measured by\ncapillary electrophoresis of samples taken before and after\ngrowth. Therefore, the medium was additionally supplemented\nwith L-aspartic acid (0.08% [wt\/vol]), L-glutamic acid (0.12%\n[wt\/vol]), and L-serine at various concentrations, as described\nbelow. The medium was supplemented as required with 50 \u0003M\nNE (Sigma Chemical Co.) or with 2% (vol\/vol) AI prepared as\npreviously described (4, 8, 16). Briefly, serum-SAPI medium\n(2.77 mM glucose, 6.25 mM NH4NO3, 1.84 mM KH2PO4, 3.35\nmM KCl, 1.01 mM MgSO4, and 30% [vol\/vol] adult bovine\nserum, pH 7.5) containing 50 \u0003M NE was inoculated at ap-\nproximately 100 to 1,000 CFU\/ml with the producing strain and\nincubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmo-\nsphere. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (6,000 \u0004 g for\n15 min), and the culture supernatants were filter sterilized and\nstored at \u000520\u00b0C until required. Sterile preparations were se-\nrially diluted in fresh sterile SAPI medium, and samples of\neach dilution were added at 2% (vol\/vol) to serum-SAPI me-\ndium inoculated with 100 to 1,000 CFU\/ml of an indicator\nstrain. The dilution that promoted bacterial growth after over-\nnight incubation at 37\u00b0C to an optical density at 620 nm\n(OD620) of 0.4, which represents 10\n8 CFU\/ml, was used as a\nsupplement to NPMM, as described below. For the experi-\nments reported here, we prepared AI from cultures of a strain\nthat we had previously reported to be Yersinia ruckeri (16) but\nsubsequently confirmed (on the basis of the Bactid-System\n[CDC, Atlanta, Ga.]) to be E. coli. It should be noted, however,\nthat virtually any strain of E. coli or any other enterobacterial\nspecies that produces enterobactin can be used both for pro-\nduction of AI and as an indicator strain for AI activity.\nThe EHEC strains analyzed in this study were from the\nculture collection of the Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode,\nGermany. Bacteria from overnight nutrient agar cultures were\ninoculated into NPMM at approximately 2 \u0004 102 CFU\/ml and\nincubated at 37\u00b0C with horizontal shaking at 150 rpm. Culture\ngrowth (OD620) was monitored in a Bioscreen C apparatus\n(Thermolabsystems, Helsinki, Finland) (16), and Shiga toxin\nproduction was determined with a commercially available en-\nzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (r-Biopharm,\nDarmstadt, Germany) and reported as the OD450. Two-tailed\nStudent\u2019s t test was used to determine the differences in toxin\nproduction between culture conditions; differences were con-\nsidered statistically significant when P values were \u00060.05.\n* Corresponding author.

Supple-\nmentation with AI significantly accelerated exponential\ngrowth, such that between 7 and 10 h, the doubling time of the\nculture in the presence of AI was consistently approximately\nhalf that in the absence of AI. After prolonged incubation,\nhowever, OD620 levels in AI-free medium and AI-supple-\nmented medium were similar. This is in contrast with the\nsituation in serum-SAPI medium (11), in which growth in the\nabsence of AI is limited to between 100- and 1,000-fold, pri-\nmarily (but perhaps not exclusively) because iron availability is\nrestricted by the presence of serum transferrin. Indeed, AI was\nso designated because of its ability to induce bacterial growth\nunder the specific conditions of serum-SAPI medium (11).\nUnder the relatively iron-rich conditions used in this study, however, the activity of AI is seen as an enhancement of the\ngrowth rate rather than the final cell density.\nTable 1 shows the effects of supplementation of NPMM with\nNE or AI on toxin production by EHEC strains of various\nserogroups in NPMM containing 0.2% L-serine. There was\nconsiderable variation in toxin levels among the strains tested;\nOD450 levels ranging from \u00060.4 to \u00074 were observed consis-\ntently over at least three independent experiments with each\nstrain. Supplementation with NE enhanced Shiga toxin levels\nsignificantly in 5 of the 10 strains, while supplementation with\nAI enhanced toxin levels significantly in all 10 strains. This was\nperhaps due to strain variability in the production of AI in\nresponse to NE. Maximal growth levels (OD620) of cultures\nwith or without AI supplementation were not significantly dif-\nferent (data not shown).\nTo determine if the effect of AI was enhanced by incipient\nnutrient starvation, strain 97-10085 was inoculated into\nNPMM supplemented with lower concentrations of L-serine\nand assayed for growth and Shiga toxin production (Fig. 2).\nThe OD620 levels reached after 24 h of incubation in medium\nsupplemented with 0.05 or 0.1% (wt\/vol) L-serine were signif-\nicantly lower (P \b 0.05) than those reached in medium sup-\nplemented with 0.2% (wt\/vol) L-serine (Fig. 2a).

MICROBIOL.\nof AI resulted in a slight but not statistically significant reduc-\ntion (P \u0007 0.05) in the maximum OD620 level achieved after\n24 h of incubation at each concentration of L-serine (Fig. 2a).\nAnalysis of toxin production in the same cultures indicated that\nadding increasing concentrations of L-serine resulted in only\nsmall increases in Shiga toxin production but that supplemen-\ntation with 2% (vol\/vol) AI markedly enhanced Shiga toxin\nproduction at all L-serine concentrations tested (Fig. 2b). Sim-\nilar data were obtained with the nine other strains listed in\nTable 1 (data not shown).\nIt has been proposed that AI preparations contain entero-\nbactin and its breakdown products, the so-called enterobactin\ncomplex formed by enterobactin-producing strains under con-\nditions of iron limitation (3, 13, 15). In the iron-restricted\nenvironment of serum-SAPI medium, the presence of sid-\nerophores would clearly explain enhanced growth and concom-\nitant toxin expression, as reported by Lyte and coworkers (8,\n11). It is unlikely, however, that the iron supply alone is re-\nsponsible for the properties of AI reported here, first because\nthe medium used is sufficiently iron-rich that an additional iron\nsource is not required for growth, and second because the toxin\nStx2, which is produced by many of the EHEC strains tested\nhere, is not iron regulated (18). High-performance liquid chro-\nmatography analysis of the AI preparations used in this study\nindicated that they do indeed contain components of the en-\nterobactin complex (data not shown), but additional com-\npounds are also present, and further detailed analysis is ongo-\ning to determine their nature and activity.\nIn terms of the application of our work, Table 1 illustrates\nthe effectiveness of NPMM supplemented with AI compared\nwith a commercially available culture medium for EHEC di-\nagnosis. Partially purified AI is very simple and cheap to pre-\npare. We therefore propose that AI-supplemented NPMM be\nused routinely to enhance the sensitivity of Shiga toxin detec-\ntion in food and environmental samples. This is especially\nrelevant when speed of detection is an important consider-\nation. Any enhancement in toxin production will shorten the\ntime required for unequivocal detection, which may be partic-\nularly valuable if a diagnostic result can be obtained in a single\nworking day rather than after an overnight enrichment step.\nWe appreciate the skillful assistance of Christel Rackwitz, Ilse\nRiena\u00a8cker, and Annette Weller. We are very grateful to Mark Lyte for\nuseful comments on an early version of the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\n1. Alverdy, J., C. Holbrook, F. Rocha, L. Seiden, R. L. Wu, M. Musch, E.\nChang, D.
