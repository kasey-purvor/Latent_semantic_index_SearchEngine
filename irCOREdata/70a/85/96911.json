Continuous models to describe the spread of biological popu- \nlations in their habitat can be derived in two ways: 1. Random walks followed \nby the so-called diffusion approximation and 2. Continuous media dynamics, \nbased on conservation laws. \nThe first systematic model to describe the space distribution of individuals \nof a single populat ion was derived by Skellam [30]. He used a random walk \napproach to deduce the equation ut = DV2u + g(u) where u = u(r, t) is the \npopulat ion density at position r and time t, D is a positive constant and g is the \ngrowth rate. In his approach the basic assumption was that the habitat is \nhomogeneous. F rom the modell ing viewpoint this means that the probabil ity \np that an individual of the populat ion moves from one point rl to another \n164 F. S~mchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \npoint r 2 in a small time interval z is the same as that of moving from i\" 2 to rl in \nthe same time interval ~, i.e., the probability is a space-symmetric function. In \nmathematical terms we have p(rl,r2)= p(rE,rl) for all pairs of points rx \nand r E . \nHowever, as pointed out by Skeltam [31] himself, there are biological \n(mating, attracting and repelling substances, overcrowding, spatial distribu- \ntion of food, social behaviour, etc.) and physical ( ight, temperature, humidity, \netc.) factors which influence population dispersal. The introduction of \nsome of these factors into the derivation of the corresponding models \nimplies that the probability p is no longer a space-symmetric function. It \ncould depend on local biological nd physical conditions uch as popula- \ntion density or concentration of a chemoattractant or chemorepellant, for\ninstance. \nIn this paper we restrict ourselves to the case in which the probability is\na density-dependent fu ction. In Sect. 2 we review several density-dependent \ndispersal models and show that their flux terms are all special cases ofa more \ngeneral case. We then consider a special type of solution to this general \nproblem, namely, travelling wave solutions (t.w.s.). In Sect. 3 we briefly review \nexistence results for t.w.s, for the linear and non-linear density-dependent \ndiffusion Fisher-KPP models. We extend these results to the general non- \nlinear degenerate diffusion equation. Section 4 contains a review of the local \nnon-linear analysis of the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) \nassociated with the dynamics of the t.w.s, for the partial differential equation \n(PDE). In Sect. 5, by analysing the global phase portrait of the ODE system \nfor sufficiently small and then for sufficiently arge values of c, we obtain the \nnon-existence of t.w.s, and a result which assures the existence of a continuum \nof t.w.s, of front type, respectively. Section 6 contains the result which ensures \nthe existence of a saddle-saddle h teroclinic trajectory i.e., the existence of \na travelling wave solution of sharp type. In Sect. 7 we prove the uniqueness of\nthe sharp front. The analytical results are illustrated by considering a few \nexamples in Sect. 8. \n2 Density-dependent models \nDensity-dependent dispersal has been observed in many biological popula- \ntions. By way of example we briefly mention a few of them. Myers and Krebs \n[23] studied the population density cycles in small rodents, in particular the \nhighest incidence of dispersal during periods of population growth and the \neffect of the stress produced by high densities in the population. Carl [7] \nobserved that Arctic ground squirrels migrate from crowded areas into \nsparsely populated areas. Morisita (in [29]) studied the spatial segregation f\nthe ant-lion Glenuroides japonicus. \nSeveral models have been proposed to describe the density-dependent \ndispersal phenomenon. The first density-dependent diffusion models in an \necological context were constructed by Gurney and Nisbet [14, 15]. By using \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fisher-KPP equations 165 \na random walk approach they deduced the equation \nau \n& = G(r)u - V .J(r, t) (1) \nfor a single species of density u where G is the intrinsic rate of growth of the \npopulation and the flux J takes different forms depending on the type of \nmovement involved. For biased motion J = - DVu - 2uVu and for directed \nmotion J = - kuVu. \nIn the remainder of this section we consider only purely diffusive phe- \nnomena, that is, we concentrate on the flux term in (1). \nGurtin and MacCamy [16], by using a continuum mechanics approach \nand assuming that the average velocity v of the population is an isotropic \nfunction of u and 7u i.e., that for any orthogonal transformation \nQ, Qv(u, Vu) = v(u, QVu), derived the equation \n0u \n& = q~'(u)VZu + ~b\"(u)II Vu l] 2 (2) \nwhere q~(0) = ~b'(0) and q~'(u) > 0 Vu >0. \nMontroll and West [21] derived a one-dimensional model for a single \nspecies by using a random walk approach. Their basic assumption was that \neach step of length a of an individual is determined by the population density \nat the nearest (left and right) points from the departure point. Their model is \na2U [-aU32 d \nau [D - 2~w(u)u] ff~x2 2~L~xJ  [w(u)u] (3) &= - , \nwhere D = aZ\/2\"r, ~ = kta2g and w is a weighting function whose value tells us \nthe direction of motion. For example, if w is constant, hen the bias depends \non the gradient of the population. \nBased on the results of Morisita's experiments on the ant-lion Glenuroides \njaponicus, Shiguesada et al. [29] developed a mathematical model to analyse \nthe spatial distribution pattern and the effect of non-linear diffusion on the \nspatial segregation of a species. By analysing the flux of ants throughout \na compartmentally divided habitat, they obtained the equation \n- =  + 2 u) x 2\/ l-aug aU ~2~ -~- + [IgU'(x)] (4) at \nwhere U(x) is a space-dependent function which measures the favourableness \npotential of the habitat at the point x. \nAronson [4] denoted by u~ and pj(ul), respectively, the population density \nat locus al at time nz and the probability of a jump of aj units starting from \nlocus al given that the population density at al is ul. By assuming that \np j(- ) = 0 for sufficiently large IJl and that the conservation law ~j~ z pj(u) = 1 \nholds, he proved the following recursion relationship \n\u00f71 y u\" ,u .  , = I-jPA l-j), j eZ ,  neZ +. \njsZ \nt66 F. Sfinchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \nFurthermore, he then showed that u satisfies \n~u 2 0 2 \n8t - 2 Bx 2 [u~b(u)] - 2 ~xx LUq;tu)J, \nwhere \n(5) \nL \"2 n 1 J pj(uz) ~ (o(u) and - ~ jpj(u']) ~ O(u), \njEZ a j~z  \nnz ~ t, al ~ x and a2\/z - -~ 2 as z, a ~ 0 and 1, m ~ ~.  The second term in the \nright hand side of (5) can be interpreted as a drift term which vanishes if \np~( ' )  = p - t ( ' ) .  \nIf, instead of supposing that the probabilities depend on the local popula- \ntion densities, it is assumed that they depend on the average between the \nbeginning and the end of the step, it can be shown [-4] that \nOt - Ox p(U)~x \" (6) \nNote that if we define D such that q~(u) = ~o D(s)ds then model (2) takes the \nform \nOu \nOt D(U)V2u + O'(u)llVull2 (7) \nwith D(0) = 0 and D(u) > 0 Vu. Observe also that if we set \n~(u) = [D - 2Ow(u)u] then (3) can be written as \npul  - ~ + ~'(U)Laxj  . (8) \nAlso, if we set ~(u) = ~b(u) + u(9'(u) with zero drift term in (5), then this \nequation takes the form (8). Furthermore, setting D(u) - (~ + 2flu) and impos- \ning a constant potential environment U in model (4), leads to the equation \n0--[ = ~ + D'(u) . (9) \nHence, models (2), (3) and (4) are all special cases of the one-dimensional \nversion of (7). Therefore, we propose to analyse travelling wave solutions for \na reaction-diffusion model in which the diffusive term takes this general form. \n3 Brief review of existence of t.w.s, for Fisher-KPP equations \nIn this paper we study the problem of existence \nc~(x - ct) = ~b(~) for the parabolic equation \nt3u O [D(u) ~xx ] \nat - ~ + g(u) , \nof t.w.s., u(x,t) = \n(10) \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fi her-KPP equations 167 \nwhere the functions D and g are defined on the interval [0, 1] and satisfy the \nfollowing conditions: \n1. g(0) = g(1) = 0, g(u) > 0 Vu~ (0, 1), \n2 2. g ~ Cto.l~ with g'(0) > 0 and 9'(1) < 0, \n3. D(0) = 0 with D(u) > 0 Vu~ (0, 1], \n4. D E Cr2o.ll with O'(u) > 0 and D\"(u) # 0 VuE [0, 1] , \nwith initial condition u(x, O) = Uo(X), where Uo is any piecewise differentiable \nfunction with 0 < Uo(X) < 1 and boundary conditions \nlim q~(\u00a2)= 1 and lim q5(\u00a2)= 0. \nWe also require that 0 < q5(\u00a2) < 1 for all \u00a2 ~ R. \nThe ecological meaning of t.w.s, for (10) is that the individuals of the \npopulation disperse throughout he habitat in a constant density profile \nmoving with a constant speed. \nBecause of condition 3, (10) degenerates into an ODE at u = 0, while for \nu > 0 (10) is of parabolic type. This property leads to existence of a particular \nkind of travelling wave solution which can be defined as follows. \nDefinition 1. I f  there exists a value c* > 0 of the speed c, and a value \n~* ~ ( - oe , + oe ) of ~ such that u(x,t) = ~)(x - c ' t )  = (o(~) satisfies: \n1. O(~b)q~\" + c*qS' + D'(~b)[~b'] 2 + g(~b) = 0, V~e(  - oo,~*) ,  \n2. ~b(-  oe) = 1, q~(~*-) = qS(~ *+) = 0 and ~b(~) = 0 V~e(~*, + ~] ,  \n\u00a2* \n3. q~'(~*-) = - ~ ,  q~'(~*+) = 0, and (a'(~) < 0 V~e ( - oe, ~*) , \nthen the function u (x , t )= (a (x -  c ' t )  is called a travelling wave solution of \nsharp type for (10). \nBefore embarking on the analysis of this degenerate problem we briefly \nreview the results on existence of t.w.s, for the standard Fisher-KPP equation. \nThe first systematic analysis on the existence of t.w.s, for the constant-diffu- \nsion equation ut = Duxx + g(u) where D is a positive constant, g(0) = g(1) = 0, \ng(u) > 0 Vu e (0, 1), g'(0) > 0 and g'(1) < 0 appeared in two separate works \ndue to Fisher [12] and Kolmogorov et al. [19]. In both cases the biological \nmotivation was the analysis of the spread of an advantageous gene in a popu- \nlation living in a one-dimensional habitat. In fact the main ideas of the \nmethodology introduced by Kolmogorov et al. are still used today. A modern \nversion of their esult on existence of t.w.s, can be seen in Fife [11] and Britton \n[6], and may be stated as follows: For each c > c* the above equation \npossesses a monotonic decreasing front u(x, t) = (a(x - ct) satisfying the boun- \ndary conditions q~( - go ) = 1 and q~( + go ) = 0, if and only if c* is such that \n2 ~  < e* < 2x \/~ where v = supg(u)\/u and the sup is taken on (0, 1). \nFor the non-linear diffusion u~ = [D(u)ux]~ + g(u) where D is a strictly \npositive function on [0, 1] and the kinetic part g is as in the classic Fisher- \nKPP  equation, Hadeler [17] gave the lower bound on c for the existence of \nt.w.s, of front type. He also found ([18]) an important relationship between \n168 F. S~inchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \nthe ODE system associated with the t.w.s, of the Fisher-KPP equation and the \ncorresponding ODE system for the t.w.s, of the more general equation \nui = 1\/m(u)[,D(u)ux]x + g(u). Engler [10] proved that the above equation \npossesses t.w.s, if and only if the equation u, = ux~ + D(u)g(u) also has t.w.s. \nExcept for particular cases of the degenerate equation (10), the problem of \nexistence of t.w.s, for this equation is still not completely solved. For the \nequation ut = [uu~]~ + u(1 - u) a complete analysis has been carried out by \nAronson [4], Newman [24] and Murray [22]. The result may be stated as \nfollows. There\u00b0exists a value c* = 1\/x\/~ ofc such that: 1. For 0 < c < c* there \nare no t.w.s., 2. For c = c* there is a travelling wave solution of sharp type \n(the explicit form is given in [22,24]); 3. For each c > c* there is a t.w.s, of \nfront type satisfying the boundary conditions \u00a2( - Do ) = 1 and ~b( + Do ) -- 0. \nNewman [25] studied the more general system ut = [u\"u~]x + u(1 - u) using \nLyapunov functionals. De Pablo and Vfizquez [9] studied the equation \nu~ = [u\"]x~ + 2u\"(1 - u) with m > 1 and 2 > 0 They proved the existence of \na unique Iravelling wave of sharp type for 2 = l\/m and (m + n) > 0. \n4 Review: the positivity of c and the non-linear local analysis \nLet us rewrite (10) as \n[o. T a-i = D(u) ~ + V'(u) LaxJ + o(u) . (11) \nNote we note that if a travelling wave solution u(x,t)= \u00a2(x -  ct) of (11) \nexists, then it must satisfy the following second order ODE \nD(q~(~))\u00a2\" + c\u00a2'(\u00a2) + D'(\u00a2(\u00a2)) [\u00a2'(~)] 2 + 0(\u00a2(~)) = 0.  (12) \nHere dash means the derivative with respect to \u00a2 on D and with \nrespect o ~ on \u00a2. Let ~*e( -  oo, + oo] be such that 4 ) ( -  oo) = 1 and \n\u00a2(\u00a2) = 0 Dee [~*, + oo). \nThe following proposition holds: \nProposition 1. For suitable smoothness conditions on the functions D and g on \nthe interval [,0, 1],for ~* as in Definition 1, and for the two types ofbehaviour of \n\u00a2(4) in Fig 1, we have \n~loD(w)g(w)dw \nc ~-*o~ D(\u00a2(s)) [\u00a2'(s)]2ds >= O. (13) \nProof See S\/mchez-Gardufio and Maini [-27]. [] \nOur approach uses the result hat for well-posed problems, to look for t.w.s. \nfor a non-linear diffusion equation is equivalent to looking for the set of \nparameters (in which the speed c is included) for which there exist heteroclinic \ntrajectories of the system of ODEs which arises from transforming the original \nproblem into travelling wave coordinates. (See Sfinchez-Gardufio [-26]). \nTherefore the first part of the study of existence of t.w.s, for (10) consists of \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fisher-KPP equations 169 \n\u00a2 \nb \nFig. la, b.

Setting v = 4 \/ in  (12) we \nhave the following system of ODEs  \n(~ '  = \/) \n(14) \nD((~)v '  = - -  cv  - -  O'(\u00a2)v 2 -- g (\u00a2 ) .  \nSince D(0) = 0 this system possesses a singularity at \u00a2 = 0. We can remove it \nby introducing the parameter z such that \ndz  1 ~\u00a2 ds  \n- D(q~(~)) ~ ~(~) = Jo D(\u00a2(s ) ) \"  \n(15) \ndz d~ Except at \u00a2 = 0, where ~ is not defined, ~ > 0. Thus z has an inverse z-1 \nwhich in principle can be obtained from (15). Thus we have \n~b(~) = q~(z(~)) and v(~) = v(z (~) ) ,  (16) \nand we obtain \nde 1 ~ 1 \n\u00a2'(~) = ~ (z) ~-(q~(~)) and v'(~) = ... (r) D(~b(~)) \" (17) \nSubstituting qS'(~) and v'(~) into (14) we have the new system without the \nsingularity \n= D(c~)v  = f (\u00a2 ,  v) \n(18) \n(~ = - -  cv  - -  D'(\u00a2)v 2 -- g(~b) - G(\u00a2, v) \nwhere the dot denotes differentation with respect o z. \nNote that systems (14) and (18) are topologically equivalent in the positive \nhalf plane {(\u00a2,v)1\u00a2 > 0, - c~ < v < + oo }. This is true because (16) defines \na re-parametrization of thetrajectories which, according to (17), preserves the \norientation. In the remaining part of this section we only sketch the non-linear \nlocal analysis of the phase portrait of (18). Full details can be seen in [27]. \n170 F. Sfinchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \nSince D'(0) > 0, the system (18) has three equilibrium points: Po = (0, 0), \nPI = (1, 0) and Pc = (0, - e\/D'(O)). The local behaviour of the trajectories of \n(18) can be obtained as usual by analysing the linear approximation of (18) \naround each stationary point. The Jacobian matrix for all points (\u00a2, v) is \nD'(O) v \nJ[F, G](o, o = _ D,,(0)v2 _ g,(\u00a2) \nEvaluating (19) at Po we have \nJ[F, G](o,o) = F \n0 \n- g ' (O)  L \nD(\u00a2) ~ (19) \n-- c -- 2D'(\u00a2)vJ \" \n0 J, (20) \n- -C  \nfrom which t r J  [F, G](o.o) = - c < 0 and detJ [F, G](o,o) = 0. Hence the lin- \near system is inadequate to give us the local behaviour around Po. Since the \neigenvalues of (20) are 2x = 0 and 22 = - c, Po is a non-hyperbolic point of \ncodimension one (Arrowsmith and Place [5]). The corresponding eigenvectors \nare vx = (c, - g'(0)) r and v2 = (0, 1) r, respectively. \nOur non-linear local analysis uses the method of Andronov et al. [1] and \nthe Centre Manifold Theorem. According with [1], in order to determine the \nphase portrait (18) around Po we are required to use higher order terms (h.o.t.) \nin the Taylor series. For (18) the second order terms are sufficient. The \nquadratic approximation to (18) around Po is \n~p = D'(O)~bv - F2(q~,v) \n(21)  \n= - g ' (o )\u00a2  - cv + G~(\u00a2,v )  - G~(\u00a2 ,v ) ,  \nwhere Gl(\u00a2,v) = --\u00bdg\"(0)\u00a2 2 -D'(0)v 2. Therefore by the result in [1], the \npoint Po is a saddle-node for the system (21) and hence for (18). \nTo complete the analysis around Po we have, by an application of the \nCentre Manifold Theorem (Carr [-8]; Arrowsmith and Place [5]), that (21) has \na unique one-dimensional invariant stable manifold locally tangent o the \neigenvector v2 = (0, 1) r and a one-dimensional invariant centre manifold \nlocally tangent to the eigenvector vl = (1, - g'(O)\/c)T. Both of these manifolds \ncontain Po. Moreover, Carr's theorems also guarantee that any trajectory of \n(21) in the vicinity of Po, except hose on the stable manifold, tend rapidly to \nthe centre manifold. In other words, the dynamics around Po is given by the \ndynamics on the centre manifold. \nFor the application of the Centre Manifold Theorem we re-write the \nsystem (21) in its normal form, i.e., in the system of coordinates q~- \ngenerated by the eigenvector basis {vl, vz}. To do this let us introduce the \nfollowing notation \nx = , y = , Q = and \nF D'(0)\u00a2v ] \nI ( x )  = - \u2022 \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fisher-KPP equations 171 \nIn the above terms the system (21) can be written as \nYc = J[F, G](0,o)X + f (x )  . \nWe define y such that x = Qy. Substituting into (22) we have \n.~ : Q- 1j[V, G](o,o) Qy + f (Qy)  . \nBy noting that \nQ-1 J [F ,G] (o ,o )Q=[~ \nwe write the normal form of (21) as follows \nwhere \n\u00b0c I\nq~ = _ 1 [D'(0)g'(0)] (~2 + D'(0) q~25 \n\u00a2 \n1 \n= -- c5 - ~c  2[g\"(0)c 2 + 4D'(0)g'2(0)] q~2 + G3((~, v') \n(22) \n(23) \nTherefore, in the original coordinates, denoting by h (to avoid additional \nnotation) the centre manifold for (21) (hence for (18)) we have \n- - - -  I + 4D'(0)g'2(0)] 2 h(~b) = g'(0) \u00a2 _ g\"(0)c 2 \nc -2-J + 0(\u00a23)\"  \nThe flow on the centre manifold of (21) is given by the equation \n~ = F2(w,h(w)) - D'(O) {g'(O)w2 + [ -g'(O)c2 + -2~ \u00a3 .Jw3]~ -t- O(~b4). \nWith functions D and g as in Sect. 3, Fig. 2 shows the dynamics given for the \nabove equation for different values of c. There we have denoted by s the ratio \n[ -- 4D'(O)g'z(O)]g\"(O). \nThe above analysis hows that all trajectories of (21) with initial conditions \n(\u00a2o, Vo) such that x\/\u00a2 z + Vo 2 is very small: \n1. tend to Po along the centre manifold for \u00a2o > 0, \n2. move away from Po tending to the centre manifold for \u00a2o < 0. \nh( (~)  --- - I -~'t(0)C2 +2-~-4D'(0)g'2(0)~j ~2 + 0((~3). \nD' 0 ' G3($, - 3 ( )g (0) _ \nc \nThis is the standard form on which the centre manifold theory can be applied \nin a straightforward way.

For  c = 0 the sys tem (18) is hami l tonian- l ike.  Moreover  W~(Pa)  \ntends to (0, - ~ ) as z ~ + ~ . The  phase por t ra i t  is as i l lustrated in F ig.  5a. \nProof. For c = 0 the system (18) becomes \n~p = D((9)v \n= _ D ' (\u00a2 )v  z -- g(\u00a2). \n(26) \nNow we construct the system \n= [D(\u00a2)]2v \n(27) \n= -- D(\u00a2)D ' (~)v  z -- D(\u00a2)g(\u00a2) .  \n174 F.

Phase portrait of the system (18) for small values ofc: a c = 0 and b sufficiently \nsmall positive values of c \nSince D(~b) > 0 Vq~ E (0, 1] and is a well behaved function there, the paths of \nthe trajectories of (26) and (27) coincide on the region ~ defined as follows \n~= {(\u00a2,v)[0<q5 < 1, -oc  <v< +oe}.  \nNote that (27) can be written in the hamiltonian form \nq~ _ OH \n~v \n(28) \nOH ~= \nwhere \n~(4~,v) = g [D(4~)v] 2 + O(s)g(s)as, (29) \no \nwith ~bo e (0, 1). The trajectories of (27) (and thus those of (26)) coincide with \nthe level curves of H(~b, v) - C1 e R. In particular, the trace (path) of the \ntrajectory of (26) passing through (1, 0) is given by the level curve \nfj [D(~b)v] 2 + D(s)g(s)ds = H(1,0), (30) \no \nwhere \nH(1, 0) = D(s)g(s)ds. \no \nHence the negative branch is given by \nv(4)) - O(~) X\/2[H(1,o) -- f~,i D(s)a(s)ds I \u2022 \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fi her-KPP equations 175 \nThat the function v is well defined on (0, 1] can be seen by setting \n@((o) = S~o D(s)g(s)ds and verifying that: i) ~(~b) > 0 V~b~ (0, 1], ii) ~ is strict- \nly increasing on (q~o, 1) iii) ~ attains its maximum at q~ = 1, which is \n9(1) = H(1, 0). \nFrom the explicit form of the path of W~(P1) given in the above formula it \ncan be seen that lim~_~o+V(~b) = - ~ .  This completes the proof. [] \nTo continue our analysis we must use the continuity property of the \nsolutions of (18) with respect o the parameter c. Therefore we state the \nfollowing result: \nProposition 3. The solution ((a(~), v(~)) of the initial value problem \n= D(\u00a2)v  \n= -- cv -- D'(c~)v 2 -- 9((~) \nwith (9(%) = C~o, v(%) = Vo depends continuously on To, (9o, Vo and c. \nProof Given that the vector field defined by (18) depends differentiably on ~b, \nv and c, the proof follows by applying the corresponding general theorem on \ncontinuity of solutions with respect o the parameters and initial conditions. \nFull details can be found in Arnold [2]. [] \nThe following proposition can be proved: \nProposition 4. For sufficiently small positive values of the speed (c ~ 0), the path \nv(4) of W~'(P1) tends to - oo as 0 --* 0 + , while W~(Pc) leaves (in inverse time) \nthe region \n~={@,v)lO<~b_-< 1, -oo  <v<0} \nat some point C~o situated to the right of Po but sufficiently close to Po. The phase \nportrait is illustrated in Fig 5b. \nProof The first part follows by using Propositions 2 and 3. For the second \npart we have that for a given c, the uniqueness property implies that the \nmanifolds W\"~(P1) and W~(Pc) cannot cross each other. Now \nW~(P1) --+ (0, -- oo ) as \u2022 ~ oo and for small values of c the vector field (18) \nbehaves as in Fig. 5, hence W~(P~) must leave (in inverse time) the region ~ on \nthe interval (0, 1). Because of the position of Pc for small c and the vertical \nnull-clines of (18) (see Fig. 9), the exit point must be close to Po. [] \nRemark 1. Note that for c :4= 0 the equilibria Pc and Po are always connected \nby a trajectory (a trivial heteroclinic trajectory), but associated with this \ntrajectory we have q~ -- 0 which, from the physical interpretation of gb, is not \nimportant. However, the non-existence of any heteroclinic trajectory of the \nsystem (18) for sufficiently small values of c implies the non-existence of t.w.s. \nfor equation (10). \nIn the next part of our analysis, the role of the vertical null-clines (18) \nwill be important.

Since D and g are well behaved \nfunctions on [0, 1], ~ attains its max imum there. Let us denote it by M. \nFigure 6 illustrates typical shapes of ~-. \nThe shapes of V1 and 1\/2 also depend on the values of c compared with M. \nWe consider the following two cases: \nCase 1. c 2 >= M.

Let (q~o, Vl(qSo)) be the first intersection of W~(P1) \nwith the graph of V1. If ~bo > q~*, then W~'(P1) re-enters the region ~2 and \neventually re-attains V~. If this occurs for 4, < ~b*, then the vector field pushes \nW~'(P1) towards Po, while if q~0 < ~b* then there are no more intersecting \npoints and W~'(P1) reaches Po as time tends to + az. \n182 F. S~inchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \nHowever, WZ(Pc) reaches Pc as can be seen in Fig. 12a. This occurs because \nwith this behaviour of the vertical null-clines the unique possibility for W~(P~) \nto intersect the graph of V2 is at the point (q~l, V2((~l)) with ~bl > q~*. In this \nsituation, for inverse time, W~(Pc) must leave the region ~2 at the point \nQ = (1, v) where 1\/2(1) < v < 0. \nFor the case in Fig. 12b (which corresponds to Fig. 8b) we conclude that \nW2(P1) ends at Po by showing that the shaded region is a positive invariant \nset of (18) and by using the Poincar6-Bendixon Theorem. We can follow \nsimilar arguments as those given in the case of Fig. 12a to prove that W~(Pc) \nhas the same qualitative behaviour. This completes the proof. [] \nTo summarise the analysis carried out thus far, we have proved the following \ntheorem: \nTheorem 1. I f  the functions D and 9 satisfy the conditions 1-4 in Sect. 1 and for \nM as defined above, then (10): \n1. Has no t.w.s, for sufficiently small c, \n2. Possesses a monotone decreasing travelling wave solution of front type \nu(x,t) = ~(x - ct) satisfying the boundary conditions (a( - oo ) = 1 and \n(a( + oo) = O, for each c such that c 2 > m = max[4D'(qS)9(q~)]. \n6 Global analysis II: monotonicity properties and the existence \nof a sharp type solution \nIn the previous section, we proved the non-existence of t.w.s, for (1) for \nsufficiently small c. We also stated there the existence of a front type solution \nfor each c such that c 2 > M -- max[-4D'(~b)o(q~)]. In this section we investi- \ngate the phase portrait of(18) (thus the possibility of existence of t.w.s, for (10)) \nfor c e IM ---- [-Co, x\/\/-M], where Co is a positive and sufficiently small value \nof c. \nLet el and c2 be two arbitrary values of the speed on IM with cl < c2. \nDefine vcl(q~) and vc2(~b) as the trace (path) of W~I(P J and W~(Pc2), respec- \ntively, whose graphs belong to the region ~ = {(qS, v)[0 < q5 < 1, v < 0}. In \na similar way define Vco((O) and v\/-~(~b). We can prove our first monotonicity \nresult: \nProposition 5. For all (o ~ ~0, 1] the following inequality holds \nv\/~(~b) < vc2(~b) < vcl(~b) < Vco(~b). (37) \nProof Note that the equilibrium Pc = (0 , -  c\/D'(O)) moves monotonically \naway from Po on the negative vertical axis as c increases. Since \n~(b) = -v  > 0, we have that the vertical component of the vector field \ndefined by (18) is an increasing function c on the region ~ defined above, while \nthe horizontal component does not change with c. \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fi her-KPP equations 183 \nGiven that the argument is the same for any pair of functions v in (37) we \nprove the inequality only for Vco and vc,. Let us define the region No as (see \nFig. 13): \nNo = {(\u00a2,v)10 _-< q$ = q$o, V<o(\u00a2)) <= v <= 0}. \nLet (~, Vco((O)) be any point on that part of the boundary of No on the graph of \nV<o(~b ). We now consider the vector field (18) for c = cl. For the above \nproperty of (~, l?) with respect o c, each trajectory through (q$, Vco(q~)) enters \nNo and ends at Po when z --, + oe. For c = c l ,  ~)Cl(0) = - ci\/D'(O) < - co\/D'(O), \nthus the point (0, - Cl\/D'(O)) is outside of No and W~I(P1 ) cannot enter No in \nreverse time. Hence the result follows. [] \nRemark 2. By Proposition 5 we have that if W~,(Pc,) and Wc~(Pc2) leave N on \n(0, 1), then Wc~(Pc2) does so to the right of W~,(P~,), while if both leave N on \n{(q$,v)lq$ = 1, v < 0}, then Ws,(pc,) does so below W~,(PcJ. \nTo state our second result on monotonicity we start by writing the first \norder ODE for the trajectories of (18): \ndv - cv - D'(~b)v z - g((o) \n(38) \nd~ D(~)v \nand note that v = v(qS) also satisfies the boundary condition v(1) = 0. \nNow we define the function ~(qS) as \n~q(\u00a2)=(Vz -v l )exp{-F (VZVz-V~v l )D ' (s )+9(s ) (vz -V l )ds} j~  ~)~-~ (39) \nwhere ~ e (0, 1) with ~ < ~b. \nFig. 13. Proof of Proposition 5. See \ntext for details \n184 F. S\/mchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \nGiven that the trajectories of (18) leaving Pi enter the region ~, and in the \nextremum case (for large c) end at Po, it makes sense to consider that both vl \nand vz are negative on (0, 1). The following proposition holds: \nProposition 6. Let vi and v2 be two solutions of (38) correspondin9 to the speeds \ncl and cz, respectively, satisfying: i) vi(1)= vz(1)= 0 and ii) vl((o) < 0 and \nv2(~) < 0 V q5 ~ (0, 1). Then f#((o) ~ 0 when c~ ~ 1. \nProof This can be seen in [-27, 28] [] \nThe following proposition gives us a monotonicity property of the solutions of \nequation (38) with respect o the speed c. \nProposition 7. Let vl(~b) and v2(q~) be two solutions of(38) correspondin 9 to c l \nand c2, respectively. Suppose that vl and v2 satisfy; a) vi(1) = v\/(1) = 0 and \nb) [Vl(~b)v2(~b)] > 0 V~b~ (0, 1). Then for all dp in the interval (0, 1): \n1. v1(\u00a2) = v2(\u00a2) \/ f c l  = c2,  \n2. v1(\u00a2) > v2(\u00a2) \/ fc~ > c2 \n3. v~(~) < v~(6) \/ f c l  < c~. \nProof This follows by using Proposition 6. Full details can be seen \nin 1-27]. [] \nRemark 3. In geometrical terms, Proposition 7gives us the relative position of \nthe graphs of vl and v2 for q5 ~ (0, 1). For example, if ei > c2 (both positive) \nthen the corresponding graphs are as illustrated in Fig. 14. \nNow let us denote by (~bc, vc(~bc)) the exit point (in reverse time) of WZ(Pc) \nfrom the region {(~b, v)10 < q5 < 1, v > 0} and define a critical value c*, of c, as \nfollows: \nc* = inf{c > 0lqS~ = 1, vc(1) < 0} . \nGiven that for suitable values of c, W2(Pc) leaves the region { (~b, v)l0 < 0 < 1, \nv < 0} on (0, 1) this implies that the set in the definition of c* has a lower \nbound, hence c* is well defined. \n\"t] \nPo Pl \n'l) 2 \n~b \nFig. 14. Geometrical interpretation of the \nresult given in Proposition 7 \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fi her-KPP equations 185 \nWe can prove the following lemma: \nLemma 2 (Existence). For c* defined above the trajectory WZ,(Pc,) of (18) \nconnects the saddles PI and P<,. \nProof We use the continuity of the solutions of (18) with respect to c and the \nmonotonicity property given in Proposition 5. The aim is to prove that \n~bc, = 1 and Vc,(qS~,) = 0. We will prove it by contradiction. If the above does \nnot occur then we have two possibilities: \n1. ~b~, = 1 and v\u00a2,(~b~,) < 0, \n2. 0 < q$c* < 1 and vc,(q$c,) = 0. \nConsider first possibility 1. We take values ofc less than but close to c*. Let us \ndenote by v~(q$) and vc,(q$) the solutions of (38) corresponding to the speeds \nc and c*, respectively. Their graphs are the paths of the trajectories W~(P\u00a2) \nand W~,(Pc,). Because of Proposition 5 and continuity, v~(q$)> v~,(~b). In \nparticular this holds for q$c, = 1. Therefore 0 > v~(1)> vc,(q$~,). But c* is \ndefined as the infimum of the c's for which ~bc = 1 and vc(1) < 0, yet we have \nexhibited values of c for which 0 > vc(1) > v~,(q$c,). Hence we have obtained \na contradiction to the definition of c*. Therefore possibility 1. cannot occur. \nWe now consider possibility 2. Here we take values of c larger than but \nclose to c*. By using the above notation we have, by Proposition 5 and \ncontinuity arguments, that vc(~b) < v~,(~b) < 0. Moreover, 0 < ~bc, < q$\u00a2 < 0 \nwith vc,(q$c) = vc(q$c) = 0. Again we have found values of c which violate the \ndefinition of c*. Therefore our assumption is false. [] \n7 Global analysis III: the uniqueness of a sharp type solution \nand a summary \nIn this section we present an alternative uniqueness result of the saddle-saddle \nheteroclinic trajectory for (18) to that given in [27]. \nLet 0 be the angle between the positive @axis and the vector defined by \n(18) at (~b,v)e ~ i  = {(~b,v)10 < 4b _-< 1, - oo < v < 0}. For each (q$,v)~ ~1 \nand for each c, we have \nO( dp, v; c) = tan - i [  - -  cv - D' ( 4))v2 - 9( (\u00b0! c~v . (40) \nNow we can prove the following proposition: \nProposition 8. For f ixed (Q), v) ~ N i ,  0(0, v; c) is a decreasing function oft .  \nProof Let (~b, v) be an arbitrary fixed point on ~ l .  By using an elementary \nformula we have \n- O(~)v  z \nO'(C) = [.D(q~)v]2 + [. __ cv -- D'(q~)v 2 -- g(q~)]2 < 0. [] \nThe geometrical interpretation of Proposition 8 is shown in Fig. 15. \n186 F.

The angle 0 is a decreasing function of c.\nThe vectors represented by the broken lines correspond toa larger value of c than for those \ndrawn with continuous lines \nWith Propositions 7 and 8, we can demonstrate the following result on \nuniqueness of the heteroclinic trajectory for the system (18) connecting P~ \nwith Pc. \nLemma 3 (Uniqueness). For c* defined in the previous ection, the trajectory \nWc. of(18) is the unique one connecting the saddles P1 and Pc*. Moreover, (18) \nhas: \n1. No heteroclinic trajectories for 0 < c < c* ,  \n2. A saddle (PO-saddle-node (Po) heteroclinic trajectory for c > c* . \nProof Suppose that there are two critical values c* and c* of the speed for \nwhich the connections P1 - Pc* and P1 - Pc* exist. Without loss of generality \nsuppose that c* < c~. Let vl(qS) and Vz(~b) be the solutions of(38) correspond- \ning to the speeds c] ~ and c* respectively, and satisfying the boundary \nconditions: \nc~ c~ \nvl(1) = vz(1) = 0, vl(0) - and v2(0) - \nD'(0) D'(0) \" \nBy Proposition 7, in a lcft-neighbourhood f ~ = 1 the relative positions of vl \nand vz are as in Fig. 16. This holds for all values of the speed c > 0, in \nparticular for c~' and c~. The relative positions of Pc~ and Pc* on the negative \nvertical axis is also shown in Fig. 16. This implies the xistence of at least one \npoint (~bo, Vo) e N1 for which the graphs of vl and v2 intersect ransversally. \nThis means that the vectors defined by (18) at (qSo, Vo) for c~ and c~' are as in \nFig. 16. This contradicts Proposition 8. Note that both items 1. and 2. are \nconsequences of the continuity of the solutions of (18) with respect o c (see \nProposition 3) and of the behaviour for small and large values of c. Hence the \nresult. [] \nDegenerate non-linear diffusion Fi her-KPP equations 187 \nP0 \nFig. 16. Proof of Lemma 3. See text \nfor details \nFor c* as defined in Sect. 6, and using the continuity of the solutions of(18) \nwith respect o c, we can summarize all the results in the previous ections in \nthe following theorem which is the main result of this paper: \nTheorem 2. I f  the functions D and 9 in (10) satisfy the conditions 1 to 4 9iven \nabove, then the reaction-diffusion equation (10) has: \n1. No. t.w.s, for 0 < c < c* ,  \n2.

A monotone decreasin 9 travellin9 wave solution of front type satisfyin9 \nc~( - oo) = 1 and (o( + oo ) = O for each c > e* . \n8 Illustrative examples \nHere we apply the results of the above sections to different non-linear \ndegenerate parabolic equations corresponding to several forms of the diffu- \nsion term D and of the kinetic part 9 in (10). The numerical simulations that we \nwill carry out are on the phase portrait and on the solutions of the full PDE. \nIn this section we use a program written by Malajovich [20] which draws the \nphase portrait of two-dimensional utonomous systems of ODEs. This pro- \ngram uses a Runge-Kutta method to solve the ODE system. We obtain the \nsolution of the full PDE by using the NAG library routine DO3PGF, which \nreplaces the space derivative by finite differences to approximate he PDE by \na system of ODEs. This system is integrated forward in time using Gear's \nmethod. We also plot the speed of the t.w.s, as time increases. \nExample 1. Consider the degenerate parabolic equation \n~t - ~x (flu + u 2) ~xx + u(1 - u) , (41) \nwhere fl > O. \n188 F. Sfinchez-Gardufio, P. K. Maini \nClearly the functions D(u) = (flu + u 2) and g(u) = u(1 - u) satisfy the condi- \ntions imposed in the previous ections and therefore all the above results hold. \nSuppose that (41) has a travelling wave solution u(x, t) = c~(x - ct) =- dp(~). \nSetting v = \u00a2'(~) we have that the second order ODE for \u00a2 can be written as \nthe following singular system \n~b'=v \n(42)  \n1 \nv ' -  cv - ( f l  + 2\u00a2)v  z \u00a2(1 \u00a2)] +  b2)E - - - \u2022 \nIntroducing the parameter ~as in (15) with D(~b) = fie + ~b z, we get a new \nsystem without the singularity \n= + \u00a22> \n(43)  \nf: = - cv - ( f l  + 2\u00a2)v  2 - qS(1 - q~) \nwhose equilibrium points are Po = (0,0), P1 = (1,0) and Pc = (0,v*), where \nIn Fig. 17 we show the numerically calculated phase portraits of the \nsystem (43) for\/~ = 2 and for different values of c. These agree with the analysis \nof the previous ections. In particular, this figure shows that system (43) has \na saddle-saddle h teroclinic trajectory for values of c close to 1.0979 which, by \nLemma 3, must be unique (see Fig. 17b). Corresponding to this connecting \ntrajectory we have a travelling wave solution of sharp type for equation (41). \nThis is because ~b( - oo ) = 1 and as z increases \u00a2 tends to 0 but q~ tends to \n- 1.0979\/2. \nFigure 17a shows the non-existence of heteroclinic trajectories, which \nmeans non-existence of t.w.s, for (41). Figure 17c shows a saddle to saddle- \nnode connection which was also predicted by the analysis of the previous \nsections. In this case, since \u00a2( - oo ) = 1 and \u00a2( + oo ) = \u00a2( + oo ) = 0 with \nq~(z) < 0 Vz ~ ( - oo, + ov ), corresponding to the above connection we have \na monotonic decreasing front type solution for (41). \nIn Fig. 18a we show the numerical solution f the PDE (41) for the step \nfunction initial condition \n1, Vxe( -x  . . . .  0) \nU(x,O) = \/go(X) = 0, VXe  (0, Xmax) \nwhere Xmax > 0 and such that 2Xma x is the size of the space interval on which \nthe equation is solved.
