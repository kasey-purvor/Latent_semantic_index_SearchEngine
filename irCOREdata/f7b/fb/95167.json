Enthusiastic forecasts suggest an explosion in demand \nwith more than half a billion customers subscribing to video services on their mobile \nphones by 2011 (ABI Research, 2006). However, in light of delays in the planned \nlaunch of services around the world and slower uptake by smaller numbers of users \nthan many predicted, there is increasing scepticism about the hype surrounding \nmobile TV, as indicated by the theme of the opening panel of the Mobile TV World \nSummit (2008): \u201cThe death of mobile TV?\u201d  \n \nThe technology is mainly at the trial and commercial launch stages. Its development \nwill depend on technological, commercial, social, political, regulatory and other \nfactors that are unclear; for example, the implications of the spectrum that will be \nreleased for mobile TV following the switchover from analogue to digital \nbroadcasting in the UK, content protection technologies, licensing frameworks, and \ndevelopment of profitable business models. It seems pointless, therefore, to engage in \nspeculation about how the new medium will evolve, how mobile TV might be used \nand how the industry might develop, but it may be useful to understand how this \nemergent technology is currently constructed and understood; what claims and \nassumptions are being made about its anticipated impact on viewers\u2019 experience and \nits implications for the industry. \n \nTo this end, this paper explores current thinking about mobile TV, particularly how \nexperts involved in the production, marketing, delivery and analysis of these services \nregard this emergent technology. The discussion is based on a review of published \nmaterial on mobile TV (in English and Chinese), including industry and press reports, \n 2 \nconference proceedings, websites and online bulletins, academic studies, \nadvertisements, results of mobile TV trials in Europe, the US and Asia, interviews \nwith six industry and academic experts (Appendix 1), and attendance at two events \ninvolving industry experts (Mobile Meets Media, July 2006; The Impact of Mobile \nTV, November 2006 - Appendix 2). The aim of this review was to tap into \ncontemporary debate on mobile TV and examine the construction of the technology.  \n \nThe paper starts by defining mobile TV, before examining four concepts often \nexploited in public debate on this technology, namely \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019, \u2018TV \nanytime, anywhere\u2019, \u2018TV on the go\u2019 and \u2018Enhanced TV\u2019. We suggest that these terms \nprovide a useful entry point to contemporary thinking about mobile TV. They provide \nconceptual frameworks for the way mobile TV is understood; the promises and \nopportunities it offers, and the challenges it is seen as presenting to viewers and \nplayers involved in producing and delivering its services.  \n \nDebate on new media is often characterised by rhetoric about the novelty and \npotential of technology. The discussions on mobile TV demonstrate similar rhetoric: \nthey are replete with both utopian and dystopian assertions about the technology\u2019s \npotential and novel characteristics. However, the accounts of experts involved in the \nproduction, marketing, delivery and analysis of mobile TV, reveal that their thinking \nabout the technology extends beyond this rhetoric. It seems that at the heart of \ncontemporary discussions on mobile TV is a tension between new and old. On the one \nhand, there is an emphasis on its newness as a cultural experience and a technological \nform, perpetuating claims about the distinctiveness and novelty of mobile TV and the \nbreak from familiar technological experiences. At the same time the novelty of \nmobile TV is continuously articulated in tandem with, and in relation to the \u2018old\u2019. \nIndustry experts, journalists and analysts frequently claim that mobile TV evolves \nfrom, builds upon and enhances existing and previous technologies and familiar social \ncontexts.  \n \nThe analysis in this paper examines this dual articulation of mobile TV, using \nMarvin\u2019s (1988) account of the tension between articulations of old and new in the \nsocial construction of the telephone and the electric light as a framework. One \n 3 \nobservation particularly informs our analysis of contemporary discourse about mobile \nTV:  \n \nNew media, broadly understood to include the use of new communications \ntechnology for old or new purposes, new ways of using old technologies, and, \nin principle, all other possibilities for the exchange of social meaning, are \nalways introduced into a pattern of tension created by the coexistence of old \nand new, which is far richer than any single medium that becomes a focus of \ninterest because it is novel (Marvin, 1988, p. 8, my italics).  \n \nWe point to the competing claims made by experts charged with the production and \nconstruction of mobile TV and show how they construct the technology as evolving \nfrom and being introduced into this \u201ccoexistence of old and new\u201d. The discussion \nseeks to enhance understanding of this new medium and how it is being shaped and \nunderstood in contemporary debate, an issue which has received little attention to \ndate. In so doing, the paper aims to contribute to the broader field of research on the \nsocial construction of new communications technology.                 \n \nWHAT IS MOBILE TV? \nDifferent standards for mobile TV have evolved around the world, and the term refers \nto various technologies and forms. There are two main technological forms: streaming \nand broadcast. The former uses 3G networks to stream content to mobile handsets. \n\u2018On-net\u2019 streaming or unicast is how most mobile operators currently deliver mobile \nTV. However, there are capacity issues related to streaming, and it is unlikely to be \nsuitable for mass-market uptake, especially in situations where large numbers of \nviewers want to watch the same programme simultaneously. Broadcast mobile TV, \nwhich includes various competing technologies such as DVB-H, DMB, BT Movio, \nDAB-IP, MediaFlo and ISDB-T, is expected to eventually dominate the market, \nprimarily because it does not have the capacity constraints of streamed TV (Kaul, \n2006).  \n \nIn this paper, we define mobile TV as encompassing live simulcast TV on mobile \ndevices, providing content similar to that broadcast on regular satellite, digital or \ncable channels as well as original content. This definition includes on-demand video, \n 4 \ni.e. clips that can be downloaded and broadcast to large numbers of users (Kaul, \n2006). According to a report published in September 2007 \u201cmobile subscribers exhibit \na preference for on-demand videos to live TV delivered over cellular networks\u201d \n(Mobile TV News, 2008).  \n \nThis deliberately broad definition seems to represent the views of key players in the \nindustry, for example, operators such as O2, and manufacturers such as Nokia. It \nemphasises that mobile TV builds on existing platforms, primarily TV, mobile \ntelephony and the Internet.[1] This view is encapsulated by Nokia\u2019s advertisement for \nits N-series mobile TV devices \u201cTelevision in your hand\u201d,[2] which shows a young \nman in a city, gathering up different media items. As he gathers up each item, it \n\u2018shrinks\u2019 in size:  \nA phone box \u2013voiceover: \u201cfirst it was the telephone\u201d; \nBillboard \u2013voiceover: \u201cthen photography\u201d;  \nMusic note \u2013voiceover: \u201cmusic\u201d;  \nComputer and TV screens \u2013 voiceover: \u201ccomputing and e-mail\u201d. \nFinally, a public television screen showing a live football match shrinks in his hand to \nthe voiceover: \u201cnow Nokia puts TV in your hand\u201d. This notion of convergence and \ncontinuity with previous and existing platforms, technologies and user experiences, is \ncentral to how mobile TV is constructed and understood in contemporary debate \u2013 as \nwill be argued below. \n \nFOUR CONSTRUCTIONS OF MOBILE TV \n\u2018TV in your pocket\u2019, \u2018in your hands\u2019, \u2018on the go\u2019, \u2018anytime, anywhere\u2019 and \u2018enhanced \nTV\u2019, \u2018beyond broadcasting\u2019 (Meikle and Young, forthcoming), \u2018delivering the future \nof broadcasting\u2019 \u2013are some of the terms and concepts being used to describe and \nmarket mobile TV services. They provide useful entry points into current ways of \nthinking about this emergent medium, particularly in relation to users\u2019 experience and \nimplications for the industry. We seek to unpack these terms to explore how mobile \nTV is shaped and understood in contemporary debate. We treat these discourses as \nconstructions that make certain claims about the promise, opportunities and \nchallenges of mobile TV \u2013 as content, form, experience and institution. The analysis \nexamines how these concepts frame mobile TV as a novel medium, emphasising the \nsense of change and promoting claims about the new possibilities that the technology \n 5 \nenables, while at the same time, positioning the \u2018novel\u2019 dimensions of the technology \nin relation to features and experiences regarded as \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018familiar\u2019, thus \nemphasising a sense of continuity with the present and the past.  \n \nTV in your pocket  \n\u201cVerizon puts your TV in your pocket\u201d (Gwinn, 2007) was the title of an article in the \nChicago Tribune on the latest mobile TV services. \u201cA small, miniaturised version of \nthe BBC Television Centre can be packed into the pockets of billions across the \nglobe\u201d wrote Philip Gould, a prominent British political adviser and Chairman and \nowner of the market research company Philip Gould Associates (Carphone \nWarehouse\/LSE, 2006, p. 41). \u201cLive TV in your pocket\u201d is the title of T-Mobile\u2019s \nproject of digital TV broadcasting for mobile phone handsets, and is also used by \nNokia to describe its mobile TV services (Nokia Press Backgrounder, 2007).  \n \nThe concept of \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 carries the promise of private and personalised \nviewing \u2013 the idea that users will be able to access TV content and consume it on their \nprivate personal screens, in an environment that for them is most convenient, \ncomfortable and relevant.  New media\u2019s potential for personalisation, is, as Kennedy \n(2008) observes, a central trope in the contemporary thinking of academics, \njournalists, politicians and IT and creative industry workers. Discussions on mobile \nTV often include users\u2019 direct experiences in order to emphasise the centrality of \npersonalisation and demonstrate its appeal. For example, one of the very few \nacademic studies of mobile TV (Sodergard, 2003) looks at users\u2019 experience in \nFinland and highlights that the ability to view television in private was regarded by \nusers as one of its best features. Findings from commercial trials with users (in South \nKorea, see Chipchase et al., 2006; Finland, see Finnpanel, 2005; Spain, see Mobile \nTV Forum, 20 February 2006; 11 May 2006; UK, see Lloyd et al., 2006; Mason, \n2006) reinforce the significance of mobile TV as a private viewing environment in \nrevealing that about a third of users watched mobile TV in their homes. Experts cite \nthis finding (e.g. Mobile Meets Media, July 2006) to argue that mobile TV is used as \na private personal screen, enabling users to avoid other members of the household, or \nto watch different programmes from what is showing on the home TV set. \n \n 6 \nA similar construction of mobile TV as enabling a personal private viewing \nenvironment is evident in the series of four video clips created by students in \nGermany, published on You Tube. The clips, by Hosentaschenwelt Mobilerleben, \ninvite the viewer to \u2018enter\u2019 the private viewing of four family members on their \nmobile screens; in each clip the camera allows us to see through the individual\u2019s eyes \n- father, mother, son, daughter. These ads project the idea of mobile TV consumption \nas a highly individualistic, personalised and private experience, customised to the \nindividual\u2019s preferences (the content) and context (time, place and situation). \nCommercial players in the mobile TV industry project similar views, exemplified in \none of Nokia\u2019s press releases on mobile TV entitled \u2018The Future of Television will be \nPersonal\u2019 (10 November 2006). Similarly, Philip Gould (referred to above), in a \nreport commissioned by Carphone Warehouse\/LSE (2006, p. 41) describes how \nmobile communication will enable people to become \u201ctheir own personalised \ncommunications centre - with the power to receive news and to create news, to \nreceive opinion and to transmit opinion.\u201d  \n \nThis image is reinforced by the idea of customisation, which is often coupled with the \n\u2018pocketing\u2019 of television. Dr Anxo Cereijo Roib\u00e1s (interview 2; Cereijo Roib\u00e1s and \nJohnson, 2006), User Experience Research Manager at Vodafone, envisages that \nmobile TV will enable users to customise content to suit their contexts, interests and \npreferences:  \nI think the system should understand the context of the user, and the context in \nmy opinion is obviously where he is, the time of the day, who he is, the \nidentity and profile of the user. For example, I don\u2019t like sports so why should \nI get sports on my mobile? Or if I am in Brighton, I don\u2019t care about the \nweather in London \u2013 I don\u2019t need to see the weather in London [on my mobile \nTV screen] (interview 2).   \nThese constructions of mobile TV as a \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 that enables a highly \npersonalised, individualised, and private experience, depict mobile TV as a medium \nthat offers a very different kind of experience from current TV viewing. The notion of \npeople becoming \u201cpersonalised communications centres\u201d, whose mobile devices \nidentify their location and broadcast appropriately customised content, seems to be \n 7 \npart of a futuristic rhetoric and imagery - what Kennedy (2008) describes as the \nrhetoric of the potential, the sublime or the mythical, referring to what the new \nmedium might be. Underlying the current discussions of \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019, \nhowever, there is also a consistent attempt to emphasise mobile TV as a technology, \nexperience and cultural form that is fundamentally connected to, builds upon, and \ncontinues existing structures, patterns of use and experiences.  \nWhile discussions of \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 construct mobile TV in terms of its \npotential to radicalise our lives by making us \u201cpersonalised communication centres\u201d, \nin perpetuating this rhetoric they are connecting mobile TV to other technologies that \nhave been discussed in similar terms. Personalisation as the capacity to adapt mobile \nTV to meet the needs and desires of its individual users (based on Kennedy, 2008, p. \n308), is described as an extension of the broader trend towards personalisation that \ncharacterises users\u2019 contemporary technological experiences, such as mobile \ntelephony and the Internet. In response to the question \u2018What is mobile TV?\u2019, Harri \nM\u00e4nnist\u00f6, Director and Head of Watch New part of Nokia\u2019s Multimedia Business \nGroup said:  \nThe key word for us is personal \u2026 the first marathon in this industry was \nbasically about personal telephony, and in my mind what we are now \nbasically starting is the second marathon, which is the personal TV and video \nconsumption (interview 3). \nM\u00e4nnist\u00f6 sees personalisation as the distinctive feature of mobile TV. The notion of \nthe \u2018personalisation marathon\u2019 is clearly associated with rhetoric of novelty, progress \nand change. However, fundamentally, M\u00e4nnist\u00f6 (and more generally Nokia, which he \nrepresents and which constitutes a significant voice in current debate) locates this \npersonalisation historically, in relation to what he calls \u2018the first marathon\u2019 of \npersonalisation, that of telephony. Luca Pagano, Vice President and Director of the \nUK branch of mobile media and technology company, Buongiorno, has a similar \nunderstanding of the emergent technology. He claims that the mobile TV market and \nits potential success \u201chave been driven fundamentally by the drive for \npersonalisation\u201d, a drive, he argues, that characterises the mobile market more \nbroadly (interview 5). M\u00e4nnist\u00f6\u2019s historical span is longer (he has worked in Nokia \nfor over three decades, an experience which shaped his view of the personalisation \n 8 \noffered by mobile TV as an evolution of telephony); Pagano\u2019s point of reference is \nthe mobile phone. Notwithstanding this, both accounts reflect an important \nacknowledgement that seems central to contemporary understanding of mobile TV: \nthat the technology, with the significantly novel personalised and new experiences it \nenables, is fundamentally shaped by preceding technologies and user experiences.  \nAt the same time, a trope in contemporary discussions of mobile TV, which \nchallenges the emphasis on personalisation and the centrality of the individualistic \nexperience of mobile TV consumption, is sociability. Mobile TV is constructed as a \nsocial tool that facilitates and enhances social experience. The Nokia 77 \nadvertisement [3] is a good example. A man is depicted \u2018on the go\u2019, watching a \nfootball match on his mobile screen while leaving the house, walking along the street \nand travelling by train. He watches on his own, but shares the crucial moments in the \ngame with people in the street and on the train. We also see two men watching \ntogether; the initial assumption is that they are watching a regular TV, but then it \nbecomes clear that they are sharing the experience of watching on a mobile screen. \nThe message is that rather than isolating people, watching mobile TV will maintain, \nand perhaps even enhance and enrich the social experience and the sharing of \ndramatic media moments.  \nCommentators in current debates on mobile TV sometimes cite the example of users \ncollectively watching mobile programmes (or listening to music tracks), for instance, \nin the pub. Matthew Postgate of BBC Future Media and Technology Commissioning \nTeam, describes this as an instance of users \u201cturning mobile TV back into a social \nexperience\u201d (The Impact of Mobile TV panel, 10 November 2006). Although \nevidence of this pattern of use is mostly anecdotal, the examples are used to suggest \nthat TV viewing on a mobile screen could actually have a strong social dimension.   \n \nSimilarly, there are ongoing discussions about the development of \u2018mobile \ncommunities\u2019 (e.g. Mobile TV World Forum, 2005). In a recent forum in which users\u2019 \nexperience of mobile TV was discussed (Mobile TV World Summit, 2008), the \nDirector of Mobile TV Business Development EMEA at Motorola described the \ndevelopment of mobile user communities as one of \u201cthe \u2018convergent\u2019 building blocks \nof the ultimate mobile TV experience\u201d. The South Korean experience of fan \n 9 \ncommunities is sometimes mentioned in this context; these communities evolved \naround mobile TV programmes, involving interactions among users and with \ncelebrities using mobile devices (interview 1).  \n \nThese examples of the discussion on mobile TV show how, in parallel to ongoing \nemphasis on individual-based and privatised use, \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 is also \nconstructed as a social tool that will enhance social interaction and facilitate \nnetworking. The emphasis on the social dimension of mobile TV frames the new \nmedium as an enhancement of, rather than a break from, one of the key functions of \nmedia and communications technologies, that of creating, maintaining and \nstrengthening social relations.  \n \nTV anytime, anywhere    \nThe concept of \u2018TV anytime, anywhere\u2019 highlights the release of viewers from one of \ntraditional television\u2019s most significant constraints: the need to be in a \u2018place\u2019 with a \ntelevision set, usually the home. TV anytime emphasises users\u2019 novel capacity to \nextend reach and range and to control, through their own volition, what content to \nconsume, when, how and, where. Sodergard\u2019s (2003, p. 63) study, for example, shows \nthat independence from the traditional TV set was one of the key benefits cited by \nusers of mobile TV.   \n \nSport, particularly live matches, is frequently cited as the ultimate content category \nwhere the ability to control when and where to watch television is crucial: \u201cFor \nanyone addicted to sport, this [mobile TV] could be a real drug\u201d wrote a Canadian \ncommentator celebrating this promise (Blau, 2006). Analysts reinforce the mobile TV \npromise of \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 viewing by discussing events such as the 2006 \nFootball World Cup, the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and the 2012 games in \nLondon. Fans are being promised that they can watch sport events on their mobile \nscreens without the need to be physically close to a TV set (e.g., Economist \nTechnology Unit, 2007; Luo, 2006; Pradhan, 2006; Qin, 2006).   \n \nThe other element of \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 is release from the temporal structure of the \ntelevisual experience, to an environment where viewing times and schedules are not \nnecessarily relevant. This aspect, too, speaks to users\u2019 ability to control their viewing \n 10 \nexperience, a promise encapsulated in one of the current buzz-words: \u2018on demand\u2019. \nThe description of Sky\u2019s mobile TV on-demand services exemplifies the message of \nfreedom from broadcast schedules:   \nSky Anytime on Mobile  \nThe world of Sky in the palm of your hand    \nWith Sky Anytime on Mobile, you can take Sky wherever you go. With news \nand entertainment straight to your phone, you'll never have a dull moment on \nthe move. And if work or friends keep you out late, there's no need to miss \nyour favourite shows \u2013 Remote Record lets you set Sky+ direct from your \nmobile! (http:\/\/anytime.sky.com\/mobile.aspx) \nThis is typical of a discourse that champions novelty, progress and change associated \nwith new media. At the same time, discussion of mobile TV\u2019s \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 \ndimension seems to recognise, and sometimes explicitly stress, that this feature \nconstitutes continuity with previous technologies and user experiences. In particular, \nthe \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 promise delivered by mobile TV is depicted as a continuation \nof what TV has been associated with historically: release from physical places and \ntimes and the ability to \u2018travel\u2019 to far off places without having to physically journey. \nA comment made by T-Mobile\u2019s Senior Product Manager, Phil Lehmann, neatly \ncaptures this sense of continuity: \u201cThe [2012] Olympics will be to mobile TV what \nthe Coronation was to television\u201d (cited in Peel, 2008). In comparing the terrestrial \nTV broadcast of Elizabeth II\u2019s coronation with broadcast of the Olympic games on \nmobile TV, Lehmann highlights how mobile TV will \u2018stretch\u2019 time and space, not just \nat the level of representation (the content shown), which TV has historically enabled, \nbut also at the level of the viewer, who will be able to view anywhere, anytime. \nMobile TV promises to extend what TV can claim to have started: the ability to see \nthings that are happening far way without having to be there physically.  \n \nAnother sense in which mobile TV is constructed as extending (rather than breaking \nfrom) the experience assosciated with traditional TV, relates to the reassurance and \nsense of security to be gained from \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 viewing. Much academic \nresearch has focused on the role of TV in how we manage our time: for example, the \n 11 \nability to watch the news at the same time every day, gives a sense of control and \nconfidence (Scannell, 1988; Silverstone, 1994, 1999). Discussions of mobile TV \nhighlight this aspect, arguing the potential role of an \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 portable TV \nin providing users with a sense of control and safety. Dr Leslie Haddon, who has been \nresearching the consumption of TV and mobile communication technologies since the \nmid 1980s, reflects on this issue saying that:     \n \n[Mobile TV] will play a role when they [people] realise they forgot to set the \nvideo up. .. as a fallback.  [\u2026] Again and again people forget to set the video \nand although they phone someone at home, you know, my mother or \nsomebody like that, and ask if  you can do it for them, if they have their own \nportable television then that would be\u2026 it would give them a feeling of safety \nAnd also there\u2019s a specific type of, if you like, soap [opera] where it\u2019s \nperishable because you\u2019re going to meet someone who\u2019s going to tell you the \nending and you don\u2019t want to know it.  You know, some of these things you \nhave to actually make sure you see it because it\u2019s going to come out and \neveryone will be watching it in my circle! (interview 1, my emphasis). \n \nSimilarly, commercial players involved in the production and delivery of mobile TV \nservices refer to the sense of security and reassurance that viewers will gain from \nwatching mobile TV. Melissa Goodwin, Vice President of Interactive and Telephony \nFremantleMedia Licensing Worldwide, and a regular speaker in mobile TV industry \nforums, recently discussed the important role of mobile TV in reassuring people that \nthey are \u201cpart of\u201d: for example, learning who has been selected to take part in a \nparticular show, who has received accolades for best-performance, and catching \nbreaking world news (Mobile Meets Media, July 2006). Goodwin did not explicitly \ncompare the experiences of traditional TV and mobile TV viewing, but her emphasis \non the potential significance of mobile TV in reassuring people that they remain \nconnected and do not miss their favourite programmes is grounded in an \nunderstanding of the role of traditional TV viewing in this respect.   \n \nA Vodafone billboard advertisement for mobile TV services represents a more \nexplicit attempt to emphasise a sense of continuity between the experience of \nwatching mobile TV and the comfort and security associated with watching \n 12 \ntraditional TV. A man is depicted sitting relaxed on a sofa, watching TV, but both \nsofa and TV set are on wheels, rolling along a train track. \u2018Be a potato train\u2019 is the \ncaption, alluding, of course, to the ease and comfort of the \u2018couch potato\u2019 experience. \nThe advert reflects an attempt to connote the comfort and ease of home viewing with \nthe experience of viewing mobile TV. While the \u2018anytime anywhere\u2019 feature of \nmobile TV is constructed predominantly, if not exclusively, within a utopian narrative \nof users\u2019 freedom, control and empowerment, this Vodafone advert seems to address \n(quite sophisticatedly) an aspect that is rarely discussed: the potentially disruptive \nnature of this type of experience, and in particular, the idea that viewing is no longer \nanchored to the home, which is associated with comfort, security and control \n(Scannell, 1988; Silverstone, 1994). The message is that, with mobile TV, you can \nfeel at home without having to physically be at home.  \n \nIn this context, one of the most-discussed findings from commercial trials and pilot \nstudies, is that about a third of the participants watched mobile TV in their homes, \nwhich runs counter to expectations that this technology will be used almost \nexclusively on the move. Although this finding has been a surprise to many \ntelecommunication companies, broadcasters and manufacturers, they have used it as \nevidence of users\u2019 ease with the new medium, to argue that its usage fits seamlessly \ninto their domestic and private, intimate environments. Press releases cite the example \nof participants that do not have a TV set in the bedroom, using mobile TV in their \nbedroom in order to relax (e.g. Finnpanel, 2005; Mobile TV Forum, 20 February \n2006; Lloyd et al., 2006). Such messages are reinforced by visual advertising \nmaterial, which shows images of mobile TV users watching in bed (e.g. see Nokia\u2019s \nwebsite http:\/\/www.mobiletv.nokia.com\/resources\/videos\/), in their living rooms (e.g. \nsee Nokia\u2019s website http:\/\/www.mobiletv.nokia.com\/solutions\/devices\/) and over \nbreakfast in their kitchens.     \n \nTV on the go \nNotwithstanding the attention given to the home as an important viewing \nenvironment, in current discussions on mobile TV, the predominant image is of \noutdoor environments, and situations where people are \u2018on the go\u2019. This again \npositions mobile TV as a radically new experience compared with home and indoor \nviewing. Pilot studies and evidence from early adopters indicate three situations \n 13 \nwhere mobile TV use predominates: on trains, buses and other forms of public \ntransport [in a UK study 39% of participants watched mobile TV while commuting \n(Lloyd et al., 2006)], in waiting situations, and in breaks - studies revealed that mobile \nTV was viewed during school breaks, breaks from housework, and in coffee and \nlunch breaks at work - usually in short bursts of 10-20 minutes of news or \nentertainment (HC360.com; Lloyd et al., 2006; Mobile TV Forum, 9 March 2006).       \n \n\u2018On the go\u2019 promotes an idea of \u2018lightness\u2019 and easiness of use, as well as rapid \nconsumption, like \u2018coffee on the go\u2019. This metaphor is extended by the concept of \n\u2018snacking\u2019, which frames users\u2019 experience of mobile TV. Commercial trials and \nevidence from early adopters consistently show that the majority of users \u2018snacked \non\u2019 between 5 and 40 minutes of mobile TV per day, with individual programmes \nbeing watched for periods of less than 5 minutes on average. A recent consumer study \nby the mobile TV and video solutions provider QuickPlay Media reported that: \u201cClose \nto three quarters of U.S. wireless subscribers favor a mobile content \u2018snacking\u2019 \nparadigm over setting aside time for dedicated viewing\u201d (Fierce Mobile Content, 1 \nApril 2008). Analysts commonly draw on these findings to argue that people will \n\u2018snack on\u2019 programmes rather than watch full-length features on mobile TVs (e.g. \nFreid, 2006; Informa, October 2006; Mobile TV News, 10 March 2006).   \n \nThe \u2018snacking\u2019 metaphor emphasises the difference between mobile and traditional \nTV viewing. The latter, despite its increasingly fragmented character induced by \nusers\u2019 tendency to \u2018hop\u2019 between channels and programmes, is still considerably \nassociated with the \u2018couch potato\u2019 viewer who engages in a relaxed, prolonged \nexperience of viewing a programme from beginning to end. By contrast, the central \nimage of the mobile TV user who \u2018snacks on\u2019 content, is one of someone on the go, \nsomeone in a hurry whose viewing might be interrupted, and usually in an urban \nenvironment (see, e.g., Ok, 2005, p. 226; see also Nokia advert, fn 3). \n \nThis construction informs discussions about the content, format and genres that are \nbeing predicted to be suitable for, and popular on mobile TV. The central claim is that \nthe content will need to be suited to \u2018snacking\u2019, that is, not designed to be watched \nfrom beginning to end, to accommodate limited attention spans and battery life. For \nexample, a commentator at the New York Daily News writes: \u201cyou get to grab a quick \n 14 \nbite, and if you\u2019re interrupted it\u2019s no big deal (Osterhout, 2006). QuickPlay Media's \nVP of marketing, Mark Hyland, develops this idea, saying that  \n \nWe're seeing the on-demand content model is a lot stronger than the broadcast \nmodel--consumers want bite-sized chunks, and the average user will even \nbreak up longer content into smaller chunks. Music-related content like music \nvideos do well, as do local weather, news and traffic (Fierce Mobile Content, 1 \nApril 2008).    \n \nIn this context, there was some initial fascination with the concept of \u2018mobisodes\u2019, \nwhich are \u2018snackable\u2019 fragmented and small made-for-mobile episodes, originally \ndeveloped by Fox. Fox promoted mobisodes as an innovative short-duration format \nsuitable for bite-sized portions of content to be consumed on the go, mitigating the \nproblems of staring at a small screen for too long. It first introduced mobisodes of its \npopular television TV drama 24, and ABC followed with mobisodes of its hit drama \nLost. These episodes followed the plot lines of their broadcast counterparts, but had \ntheir own scripts and casts. Alongside these spin-off programmes, some entirely new \nshows, for example, Free Stylin\u2019, a programme created by Comedy Time, based on \nunder-three minute mobisodes, were produced (Fitchard, 2006).  \n \nRecent reports show that the popularity of the mobisode format has been limited (e.g. \nArthur, 2007), but interest in the notion of \u2018snackable\u2019 content persists, evidenced in \nongoing discussions on the question of what genres will suit the mobile screen. Many \nsee news as a relevant genre for mobile TV, because of the ability to watch events as \nthey occur, but also because of its inherently fragmented format, that is, the fact that \nnews programmes are collections of short items, and do not have to be watched from \nbeginning to end. The expectation that news will become a leading viewing category \non mobile TV drives, and is driven by, global news players such as CNN, who \nrecently launched a mobile TV service as part of its broader CNN Mobile activities. It \noffers \u201ca searchable archive of 14 days and over 2000 stories\u2026with breaking news \nalerts and video news updates through the hourly updated \u2018World News Now\u2019\u201d(Fierce \nWireless, 2007). Some broadcasters, such as China Unicom, have experimented with \nshorter and more concise news programmes than those shown on traditional TV, e.g. \nmade-for-mobile news that lasts only one minute (Bai, 2005). Other genres being \n 15 \ndiscussed as popular viewing categories based on current use data and commercial \ntrials, include reality TV, music and animations. Reality TV is seen as potentially \nsuited to mobile viewing because its fragmented format does not require total \nconcentration. Music is thought to be especially suited to the small screen and \n\u2018snacking\u2019 by mobile users. Broadcasters such as MTV are already offering various \nmobile TV music products, and are planning the introduction of new services, such as \nsubscription video-on-demand, which would allow consumers to request a certain \nnumber of videos to be streamed every month (Tom Erskine, Mobile Meets Media, \nJuly 2006). Animations are also seen as suitable for \u2018snacking\u2019 and would give \naudiences what MTV producers, Mikael Wullf and Anders Moregnthaler, describe as \na \u201cquick shot of adrenaline \u2013 something creative and fun which can be enjoyed and \nused while on the move\u201d (Fitchard, 2006).    \n \nWhile these discussions focus on developments in terms of new content and formats \nfor the mobile screen, and although there may be some initial enthusiasm for made-\nfor-mobile innovative content, evidence from early adopters and commercial trials \nindicates that the most watched genres on mobile TV and traditional TV are much the \nsame - news, light entertainment, sport, drama and music. Furthermore, as examples \nsuch as Fox\u2019s mobile version of 24, ABC\u2019s Lost spin-off mobile version, and ITV\u2019s \nBig Brother mobile TV version indicate, broadcasters (like other content providers, \ne.g. operators producing mobile programmes) are seeking to ride on the popularity of \nexisting programmes and genres, rather than necessarily to create entirely new and \ndifferent content. Thus, discussion of mobile TV within the frame of \u2018on the go\u2019 \npresents an important sense of continuity with, and enhancement of, previous media \ncharacteristics and user experiences. The slogan of the US mobile TV company \nmobiTV acknowledges people\u2019s fundamental attachment to traditional TV content, \nand encompasses the vision that mobile TV should provide familiar content and \nformats, but on the move: \u201cThat which moves you, should move with you\u201d.  \nFurthermore, the framing of mobile TV as \u2018TV on the go\u2019, implies experience of \nother \u2018on the go\u2019 technologies, such as mobile phones or MP3 players, which are used \non the move. Users\u2019 consumption of mobile TV is depicted as a \u2018natural\u2019 extension \nand an integral part of, existing patterns of consumption of mobile media, especially \nin urban environments. For example, the Carphone Warehouse\/LSE reports (e.g. \n 16 \nMobile Life European Report 2007; Mobile Life Report 2006) refer to people\u2019s \nconsumption of features of mobile TV as an integral part of users\u2019 experiences with \ntheir mobile phones[4]. Equally, viewing music clips on mobile TV on the move is \ncommonly referred to as an extension of, or complementary to, users\u2019 consumption of \nmusic via mobile devices such as MP players and mobile phones (e.g. IFPI, 2006; \nMobile TV News, 11 July 2006; interview 1, interview 2). \nThus, on the one hand the concept of \u2018TV on the go\u2019 emphasises the distinction \nbetween mobile TV and previous experiences of media technologies: outdoors vs \nindoors, viewing on the move vs static viewing, fragmented, often-disrupted \n\u2018snacking\u2019 of short-duration content vs relaxed viewing of full-length programmes. \nBut, on the other hand, the \u2018on the go\u2019 construction alludes to other \u2018on the go\u2019 media \nexperiences that users engage in and to existing genres and programmes that viewers \nwatch on television, implying that mobile TV will extend and enrich, rather than \ndisrupt them.  \nEnhanced TV \n\u2018Enhanced TV\u2019 refers to the ability of viewers to \u201cinteract with a TV show or extend \ntheir experience of a show by viewing more than just the linear broadcast\u201d (Sky \nInteractive, 2007). Unlike the concepts discussed above, which are exclusive to \nmobile TV, \u2018enhanced TV\u2019 is a broader concept that encompasses other applications \nand TV-related features, with mobile TV regarded as one of its focal platforms.  \nA central trope in the construction of mobile TV as \u2018enhanced TV\u2019 is interactivity. \nThis forms part of the broader (largely speculative) rhetoric about the potential \noffered by new media for interactivity as a way of engaging users, and tailoring of \nmedia objects and content to individual needs (Kennedy, 2008). In the press and at \nindustry conferences the Big Brother reality TV show, produced by Endemol and \nsponsored by O2, is often quoted as pioneering the use of interactive voting in mobile \nTV content. Other examples that analysts use to demonstrate the provision of \ninteractivity and support the assertion that users have an appetite for interactive \nfeatures on mobile TV, is the mobile TV quiz show, Millionaire, which allows \nviewers to participate if studio contestants walk away from a question, and gives them \nthe chance to win \u00a31,000 (e.g. Grenville, 2005) [5], and a platform developed by \nAccenture that allows viewers to vote for football players, bet on final scores and \n 17 \npredict from where goals will be scored (Reid, 2006). MTV is a significant player that \npromotes interactivity as key to making content on mobile TV compelling. For \nexample, MTV International\u2019s Commercial Vice President of Digital Media discussed \nin a recent Mobile TV World Summit (2008) how to engage viewers through \ninteractive features, user-generated and viral campaigns.  \n \nThat said, while there has been considerable fascination with innovative modes of \ninteractivity that mobile TV could offer (Joint Mobile TV Group, 2006, p. 29) e.g. \nprogrammes that allow viewers to choose the actors and determine how the plot will \ndevelop, using SMS voting (China Economic Net, 2006), current developments focus \non familiar interactive \u2018enhancements\u2019, such as voting (pioneered in Big Brother), \ncompetitions and quiz shows that involve viewers, and the provision of additional \ninformation related to the programme such as exclusive video footage. \n \nWithin discussions of interactivity, particular attention has been given to mobile TV \nas a potential platform for generation of users\u2019 own content. Mike Short, Vice \nPresident of O2\u2019s Research and Development and a regular speaker at mobile industry \nevents, recently commented that: \u201cCustomers want to Show, Share and Shout. We\u2019ve \nseen incredible interest from [O2] customers to share their content and show their \ninterest in choosing the content they want to watch\u201d (The Impact of Mobile TV, \nNovember 2006, see Appendix 2). Along similar lines, Dr Anxo Cereijo Roib\u00e1s, User \nExperience Research Manager at Vodafone, entertains visions of \u201ccommunities of \nnomadic users\u201d that employ mobile phones to create and share multimedia content. \nHe sees mobile TV becoming the ultimate tool for self-expression and providing users \nwith sites for networking (interview 2; Cereijo Roib\u00e1s and Johnson, 2006; Loi and \nCereijo Roib\u00e1s, 2007). \n \nOperators such as O2 and Vodafone have developed platforms to allow users to \n\u2018Show, Share and Shout\u2019. O2 launched the Look At Me service, which allows users to \nupload and broadcast their own generated videos from their mobiles to the Internet. \nThese videos can be viewed by other users on their mobile phones, and each time a \nclip is downloaded the original content provider receives a payment of 3p \n(Mad.co.uk., 2006). Another example is Soccer Addicts, also available via O2, which \nfeatures video content made by fans. Citizen journalism is seen as a particularly \n 18 \ninteresting aspect of User Generated Content (UGC), which could be facilitated and \nenhanced by mobile TV, as exemplified in Philip Gould\u2019s statement in the Carphone \nWarehouse\/LSE Mobile Life Report 2006 (p. 42) that \u201cthere is now virtually no event \nthat can happen on the planet that cannot and will not be recorded by mobile phones \nand then transmitted to the world. The mobile phone makes reporters of us all\u201d.  \n \nHowever, currently UGC platforms are provided by operators, who are the key drivers \nof talk about the potential of mobile TV for the generation of user content, while \ntraditional broadcasters seem to adopt a more reserved view about the suitability of \nmobile TV as a platform for generation of personal content. While broadcasters, \nacross the board, seem to acknowledge that mobile TV should not just offer \nretransmitted regular broadcast content and that they will be required to develop new \nways of engaging their audiences via the mobile platform - with interactive features a \ncentral element (e.g. Henry, 2005) - there seems less conviction that UGC is a feature \nthat they would want or would need to offer users. A comment from Matthew \nPostgate, Commissioning Team at BBC Future Media and Technology, illustrates this \nview:  \n \nCulturally broadcasters are getting used to the idea that we\u2019re moving from a \nworld of one-way relationship with our audiences to a two-way relationship\u2026 \nIt is important that they [audiences] are given increasing control over the \nconsumption of content. But I am not sure that this should be confused with \nsomething like You Tube\u2026It\u2019s [about] letting audiences greater control in \nwhat, when and where they consume content, not the creation of their media \n(The Impact of Mobile TV panel, 10 November 2006).    \n \nSo, while there is a lively discussion on mobile TV as a platform vital for the delivery \nof \u2018enhanced TV\u2019, views differ, sometimes quite substantially, about what \nenhancement and strengthening of relations with audiences via the mobile screen \nmight involve. Generally speaking, operators seem to be promoting interactivity, \nusers\u2019 content creation and content sharing as vital elements for mobile TV, while \nbroadcasters, although endorsing interactivity as important, are focusing on content \nproduced by them, and do not consider users\u2019 content to be a substantial aspect of \ntheir mobile TV programme developments.    \nFormatted\n 19 \n \n 20 \nCONCLUSIONS: THE PROBLEM OF NOVELTY  \nDebate on new media, led by academics, journalists, politicians, policymakers and IT \nand creative industry workers, is often characterised by a focus on, and celebration of, \nthe novel and the future. Kennedy (2008, p. 307) argues that \u201cdespite the growing \nmaturity of new, interactive media, rhetoric about its possibilities and potentialities \nthat abounded in its earliest days still endures\u201d. The debate on new media continues to \nbe shaped considerably by the \u201clanguage of the potential\u201d, that is, what the \ntechnology might be and how it might affect users (Kennedy, 2008).  \n \nCurrent debate on mobile TV is no different. As this analysis has shown, much of the \ncontemporary discussions on this emergent technology centre on its novel features: \nhow it could change and revolutionise users\u2019 experience, and how it could change \u2013 \nand quite radically - the practices of producers, such as traditional broadcasters. In \nparticular, the rhetoric on the novelty of mobile TV and its potentialities focuses on \nfour aspects. Personalisation, articulated primarily through the \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 \nconcept; release from the spatial and temporal constraints of the regular experience \nof TV viewing, encapsulated in the concept of \u2018TV anytime, anywhere\u2019; fragmented, \non the move \u2018snacking\u2019 of short-duration content in new formats such as \u2018mobisodes\u2019, \nhighlighted by the framing of mobile TV as \u2018TV on the go\u2019; and interactivity, seen as \nthe main feature of a mobile \u2018enhanced TV\u2019. \n \nAt the same time, the analysis reveals that the rhetoric on mobile TV\u2019s novelty and \npotentialities is paralleled with a continuous emphasis on the technology\u2019s relation to \nfamiliar technological worlds. A central claim made by industry experts, journalists \nand analysts, is that mobile TV has evolved from, builds upon, and enhances the \u2018old\u2019. \nThis claim is sometimes articulated in \u2018the language of the potential\u2019, that is, in an \nattempt to assert what kinds of technological experiences and features mobile TV \nmight enhance. However, it also introduces a significantly different understanding of \nthis new medium, that insists on a fundamental relation to previous experiences and \ntechnologies.  \n \n\u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 alongside the emphasis on personalisation as mobile TV\u2019s novel \npotentiality, suggests that these features constitute a continuation of previous \ncommunication technology, such as the telephone. Furthermore, a central construction \n 21 \nin the discussion of \u2018TV in your pocket\u2019 is of mobile TV as a social, rather than \nmerely a personalised, tool \u2013 an enhancement of the historical role of communication \ntechnologies of creating, maintaining and strengthening social relations. Framing \nmobile TV as \u2018TV anytime anywhere\u2019 not only highlights what a radically new \nviewing experience the technology offers, but also how it extends the characteristics \nof the familiar TV viewing experience, specifically the ability to \u2018travel\u2019 to far away \nplaces through the screen and to gain a sense of connectedness, security, comfort and \nreassurance. The \u2018TV on the go\u2019 frame, alongside the ideas it promotes about the \nfundamentally new character of viewing television, stresses two significant elements \nof continuity with previous technologies. The first concerns the genres and content \ncategories that are predicted to be most popular on mobile TV, which mirror those \npopular on regular television. The second refers to the character of the experience of \nconsuming mobile TV, which is likened to, and associated with, how other mobile \ncommunication technologies are consumed.  \n \nLastly, while mobile TV is celebrated by some as a focal platform for the realisation \nof \u2018enhanced TV\u2019, with a focus on the potential for interactivity and UGC, this \nrhetoric is continuously being balanced and challenged by different interpretations of \n\u2018enhancement\u2019. Some see the enhanced features that mobile TV can offer as the \nextension of developments already occurring in contemporary television, in particular, \nthe increasing control that viewers have over the content they want to watch and \nwhere and when they will consume it.               \n \nThus, the discourse on mobile TV is characterised by competing claims from experts \ncharged with the construction of the technology. Harri M\u00e4nnist\u00f6, Director and Head \nof Watch New in Nokia\u2019s Multimedia Business Group, has joked about how with so \nmany new technologies being denoted by acronyms, \u2018mobile TV\u2019 is a friendly term, \nencompassing an acronym with which everyone is familiar. This neatly captures the \ncentrality of the \u2018old\u2019 \u2013 a recognition of the significance of the familiar technological \nworld of TV in contemporary understanding of mobile TV. At the same time, as \ndiscussed above, M\u00e4nnist\u00f6 and other technologists involved in the production of \nmobile TV, are championing the novelty of the technology and the progress and \nchange it represents.  \n \n 22 \nThis confirms Marvin\u2019s (1988, p. 232) observation that the opposition between the \ntechnologists, who are commonly regarded as \u201cchampions of novelty, change and \nprogress\u201d, and the non-technologists, who critique the wisdom of a world that \ntechnologists have put in place, is false. Similar to Marvin\u2019s (1988) analysis of the \ndiscourse about communication technologies in the late nineteenth century, \nexamination of the current thinking about mobile TV reveals that the experts involved \nin the production and delivery of this technology are highly attentive to the inherent \ntensions created by the coexistence of old and new into which it is introduced.  \n \nOne explanation of the centrality of new\/old in the characterisation of mobile TV \nrelates to the particular trajectory of this technology to date. Since 2003, and \nespecially from 2005, the hype surrounding mobile TV has increased, with various \nenthusiastic forecasts predicting an explosion in its use and mass adoption. However, \nin 2008, the technology has yet to live up to some of these expectations. For a variety \nof reasons the launch of different services around the world has been delayed, \nsometimes more than once. There is much uncertainty surrounding several issues that \nwill affect the technology\u2019s development, including the establishment of sustainable \nbusiness models, development and implementation of appropriate regulatory \nframeworks, and certain technological problems.  \n \nThe various commercial players, including manufacturers, operators, broadcasters and \nmarket companies, that have invested heavily in the production, delivery and \nmarketing of this new technology, are confronted by this uncertainty and must \nmanage it. One way to do this is to seek to connect the new and unknown with the \nfamiliar; to promote an understanding of the emergent technology as evolving from \nfamiliar, safe, and comfortable technological and social worlds, to accommodate the \nnew technological world by \u2018lodging\u2019 it in an old one. Novelty, Silverstone (1999, p. \n12) wrote, \u201cis never simple and rarely uncontradictory\u2026Novelty is, therefore, the \nproblem\u201d. This paper has shown that novelty is a problem not just for us as analysts \nengaged in critiquing the social construction of technology, but also for the producers \nand the experts that actively participate in its construction.   \n \n 23 \nFOOTNOTES \n[1] Some experts regard this definition of mobile TV as too broad. E.g., Spectrum \nStrategy expert, Alfonso Marone, argues that mobile video services, which are already \navailable and popular at present, should not be collapsed into the term mobile TV \n(The Impact of Mobile TV panel, 10 November 2006) which, for him, refers to live \nbroadcast services available on mobile devices.  \n[2] www.mobiletvforum.com\/resources\/videos\/ (accessed 28 April 2008) \n[3] www.mobiletvforum.com (accessed 28 April 2008) \n[4] See, specifically, the reference to British people watching TV on their mobile \ndevices on p. 17 in The Mobile Life European Report 2007, and Philip Gould\u2019s \ncomment in the Mobile Life Report 2006 (p. 41), on how \u201ca small, miniaturised \nversion of the BBC Television Centre can be packed into the pockets of billions \nacross the globe\u201d.  \n[5] In the Millionaire programme each message costs \u00a31, and reported figures showed \naverages of nearly 250,000 responses, suggesting the potential for serious revenues \n(Grenville, 2005). \n \nREFERENCES \n \nABI Research (21 June 2006). \u2018Broadcast and Unicast Mobile TV Services\u2019.
