The sample\nsizes ranged from 7124 (Germany) to 118 245 (Italy) and\nconcerned the adult population (aged >16 years).\nResults: Logistic regression analysis (adjusting for age)\nidentified significant gender differences in SAH in nine\nEuropean welfare states. In the UK (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78\nto 0.99) and Finland (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95), men\nwere significantly more likely to report \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018very\nbad\u2019\u2019 health.

The increased risk of poor SAH experienced\nby women from these countries ranged from a 23%\nincrease in Denmark (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.39) to\nmore than a twofold increase in Portugal (OR 2.01; 95%\nCI 1.87 to 2.15). For some countries (Italy, Portugal,\nSweden), women\u2019s relatively worse SAH tended to be\nmost prominent in the group with the highest level of\neducation.\nDiscussion: Women in the Social Democratic and\nSouthern welfare states were more likely to report worse\nSAH than men. In the Corporatist countries, there were no\ngender differences in SAH. There was no consistent\nwelfare state regime patterning for gender differences in\nSAH by socioeconomic position. These findings constitute\na challenge to regime theory and comparative social\nepidemiology to engage more with issues of gender.\nGender differences in health are well documented\nin terms of both mortality and morbidity.1\nHowever, the extent to which gender differences\nin health vary by socioeconomic position is less\nwell documented.2 Furthermore, although welfare\nstate arrangements and social policies are increas-\ningly being acknowledged as important determi-\nnants of health and of inequalities in health,3\u20138\nthere is little research into how gender differences\nin health vary by welfare state; specifically, there\nhas been little gendered analysis with a focus on\nthe implications for women.9\u201311\nAs part of the EUROTHINE project, this study\nfocused on gender and health inequality in 13\nEuropean welfare states, representing four welfare\nstate regimes: Finland, Sweden, Norway,\nDenmark, Holland, Ireland, England, Belgium,\nGermany, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain.\nGENDER INEQUALITIES IN HEALTH\nOver several decades, research on gender differ-\nences in mortality and morbidity has highlighted\nan important paradox. On the one hand, a wealth\nof evidence suggests that, in socioeconomically\ndeveloped nations, men have shorter life expectan-\ncies than women.1 12 This gender difference is\nlargest for violent causes of death13\u201316 and from\nearly adulthood until middle age,16\u201319 but remains\nfairly stable throughout the life course.20 21 On the\nother hand, women\u2014in contrast to their lower\nmortality\u2014actually report higher morbidity\naccording to self-assessed indicators, including\nlimiting long-term illness and self-assessed health\n(SAH).22 23 Although some researchers have ques-\ntioned the existence of this gender difference,24\nmost contemporary work suggests that the para-\ndox is real, albeit smaller than previously\nthought.25\u201327\nTraditionally, this paradox has been explained as\nthe result of gender differences in the distribution\nof biological, behavioural or psychological traits.28\nHowever, there remains some debate as to the best\nexplanation for the paradox in actual mortality\nand SAH,22 29 and it has been suggested that gender\ndifferences in mortality may differ between differ-\nent socioeconomic groups or across countries.30 It is\ntherefore possible that gender differences in SAH\nmay also vary by country or, indeed, welfare state\ntype. In fact, evidence suggests that gender-\nequitable social organisation reduces gender\ninequalities in both SAH31 and life expectancy.32\nWELFARE STATES, HEALTH AND HEALTH\nINEQUALITIES\nWelfare states are important determinants of\nhealth and health inequalities as they mediate the\nextent, and impact, of socioeconomic position on\nhealth.3\u20138 Welfare state provision varies extensively\nacross the Western world but typologies have been\nput forward to categorise it into three, four or even\nfive distinctive types or welfare state regimes.9 In\nterms of Europe, although a particular country\u2019s\nclassification is often contested (eg, UK, Holland,\nItaly) and the quality of typologies questioned,9 a\nconsensus is gradually emerging that there are four\ncore welfare state regime types (see Ferrera33 and\nBambra34): Social Democratic (Denmark, Norway,\nSweden and, to a lesser extent, Finland and\nResearch report\n38 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:38\u201344. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.070292\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nHolland); Corporatist (Belgium, France, Germany); Liberal\n(England, Ireland); and Southern (Italy, Spain, Portugal).\nStudies that have examined how health varies by welfare state\nregime have invariably all concluded that population health is\nenhanced, and (absolute though not relative)35 inequalities in\nhealth reduced, by the comparatively generous and universal\nwelfare provision of the Social Democratic countries.3 4 6 7\nThe mainstream comparative welfare state regime literature\nhas only recently begun to seriously consider that the income\nredistribution, decommodification and other social effects of\nwelfare state arrangements may vary by gender and that\nseparate \u2018\u2018gendered\u2019\u2019 typologies of welfare states may therefore\nbe required.36 However, this debate has not yet filtered through\nto public health researchers and, to date, no studies have\nexamined how gender differences in health vary by welfare state\nregime.9 Similarly, cross-national studies of inequalities in\nhealth have only recently begun to examine gender differences\nby welfare state type.10 11\nIt is worth noting that some studies have considered\nsocioeconomic status as the basis of health inequalities between\nwomen and men,37\u201340 but this literature has tended to neglect\nthe role of welfare state typologies. This body of work suggests\nthat socioeconomic differences in SAH are found for both\nwomen and men,41 42 although some authors have suggested\nthat individual socioeconomic differences are less marked for\nwomen\u2019s health.43 44 Other studies have reported significant\ninteractions between women\u2019s health status and proxies of\nsocioeconomic status, such as employment, marital status and\nhousing tenure.45\u201350 However, with few exceptions,51 these\nstudies have not tended to consider how socioeconomic position\nmay be differentially related to the reported health of women\nand men in different countries or welfare state regimes.\nIn this context, this study is the first to examine the\nrelationship between gender and SAH and the extent to which\nthis varies by socioeconomic position in different European\nwelfare states and to what extent this can be explained by\nwelfare state regime theory.\nMETHODS\nThis study was conducted as part of the European Union-\nfunded \u2018\u2018Tackling Health Inequalities in Europe\n(EUROTHINE)\u2019\u2019 project. The EUROTHINE project collated\nand harmonised data from various representative national\nhealth surveys of adults (aged >16), carried out between 1998\nand 2004. Sample sizes ranged from 7124 (Germany) to 118 245\n(Italy). Information on the individual country data sources are\npresented in table 1. Further information is available from the\nEUROTHINE website (www.eurothine.org).\nSAH was measured using a five-point Likert-type scale\nranging from \u2018\u2018very good\u2019\u2019 health to \u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019 health. To\nmaximise the efficiency of the analysis SAH was dichotomised\nto compare \u2018\u2018bad and very bad health\u2019\u2019 with \u2018\u2018average to very\ngood health\u2019\u2019. Educational status was standardised across\ncountries using the International Standard Classification of\nEducation (ISCED), a four-point ranked scale with the lowest\nrank indicating the most educated (university\/higher education)\nand highest rank the least educated (primary education and\nbelow). For the purpose of the current analysis, educational\nrank was used as a proxy for socioeconomic position.\nTwo descriptive analyses were conducted. The first explored\nthe relationship between SAH and gender in each country,\nadjusting for age in years. The second stratified the analysis\naccording to the four educational ranks. Logistic regression\nanalysis was used for both analyses to obtain odds ratios\nsummarising the relationship between SAH and gender (age\nadjusted). Men were the reference group for gender and for the\noutcome of SAH \u2018\u2018average to very good health\u2019\u2019 was the\nreference.\nRESULTS\nThe proportion of individuals indicating \u2018\u2018bad and very bad\u2019\u2019\nhealth varied between participating countries (see on line\ntables). For the majority the occurrence of poor health was less\nthan 10%; however, clear exceptions were Germany (17.5%)\nand Portugal (25.9%).\nFor all the countries, except Ireland, there was a significant\nrelationship between gender and self-reported poor health\n(p,0.05). England and Finland were the only countries to have\na higher proportion of men reporting \u2018\u2018bad and very bad\u2019\u2019 health\nrelative to women. The remaining countries had a higher\nprevalence of self-reported poor health in women (see online\ntables). For all countries educational level was strongly related\nto self-reported poor health, with the least educated group\nreporting the highest levels of \u2018\u2018bad and very bad\u2019\u2019 health.\nStatistically significant differences in SAH by gender were\nobserved for nine of the 13 European countries (table 2). In\nDenmark, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Italy, Spain and Portugal, a\nsignificantly higher proportion of women reported that their\nhealth was \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019 compared with men. The\nincreased risk of poor SAH experienced by women from these\ncountries ranged from a 23% increase in Denmark (odds ratio\n(OR) 1.23; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.39) to more than\na twofold increase in Portugal (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.87 to 2.15). In\nthe UK (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99) and Finland (OR 0.85; 0.77\nto 0.95) men were significantly more likely to report \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019 health. There were no significant gender differences in\nSAH for Belgium, France, Germany and Ireland.\nThe relationship between gender and SAH, stratified by\neducational rank, appeared to vary between the countries\n(figure 1). For Italy, Portugal and Sweden, the increased risk of\npoor SAH in women appeared to be greatest in the most\neducated group. For Denmark, Spain, Holland and Norway\nthere was no clear relationship between the increased risk of\npoor SAH in women and educational level. The reduced risk of\npoor SAH in women from England was only statistically\nsignificant (borderline) for the least educated (table 2: OR 0.84;\n95% CI 0.71 to 0.99), whereas for women from Finland the only\nsignificant association between gender and SAH was among the\nmost educated (see online tables: OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.95).\nDISCUSSION\nThe results suggest that the relationship between gender and\nSAH, and the extent to which it varies by socioeconomic position,\ndoes in fact differ across European welfare states. In the majority\nof cases, women reported worse health than men, and in some\ncountries (Italy, Sweden, Portugal), these differences were most\npronounced among the most highly educated. Some of the results\n(eg, for Portugal and Italy) can be explained by drawing on welfare\nstate regime theory.33 34 52\u201357 Other countries\u2019 findings (eg, UK or\nFinland) are more challenging to welfare state regime theory.\nFurthermore, the finding that gender differences in SAH are most\nprominent in the most educated groups in some countries requires\nfurther discussion.\nConfirming welfare state regime theory\nThe fourfold typology of welfare states is very evident in our\nresults: women who are moderately more likely to report \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019\nResearch report\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:38\u201344. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.070292 39\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nor \u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019 SAH are those in the Social Democratic countries\nof Denmark, Holland, Norway and Sweden; women in the\nSouthern regime countries of Portugal and Italy (and to a lesser\nextent Spain) are highly likely to report worse SAH; whereas\nthose countries in which there appear to be no gender\ndifferences in SAH are the Corporatist countries of Belgium,\nFrance and Germany.\nThe only exceptions to this are Finland, England and Ireland. In\nwelfare state regime theory, Finland is something of a hybrid case,\nwith some typologies placing it in the Social Democratic regime33\nwhile others place it in the Corporatist53 welfare state regime. This\nis perhaps a reflection of the shorter history of the welfare state in\nFinland (which was not developed until the 1970s) compared\nwith the other Nordic welfare states. England and Ireland are\nalmost always placed together in the Liberal regime type.\nWelfare state regime theory is therefore able to provide some\ninsight into how the countries analysed have grouped in terms\nof gender differences in SAH. However, although the high levels\nof \u2018\u2018bad\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018very bad\u2019\u2019 SAH among women in the Southern\nregime countries reinforces research into gender and welfare\nstates regimes, which has long highlighted the lack of support\nfor women and their low economic and political participation in\nthese countries,58 the results for the other regime types is less\neasy to explain through reference to this literature.\nChallenging welfare state regime theory\nResearch into population health differences across welfare states\nhas tended to find that health is better in the Social Democratic\ncountries.3\u20138 57 58 Furthermore, these welfare states are widely\nseen as the most progressive in terms of gender equality.36 54 55 58\u201361\nSo the expectation would therefore be that gender differences\nin SAH would be comparatively smaller in the Social\nDemocratic countries. However, this was not the case in our\nstudy. One possible explanation is that the mechanisms at play\nin terms of gender and health cannot be overcome by the\ntraditional Social Democratic welfare interventions of income\nredistribution and extensive public service provision alone.8\nIndeed, some feminist critiques have suggested that such\npolicies have actually transferred women\u2019s economic dependency\nfrom the family to the state\u2014from private to public patri-\narchy.62 63 Interlinked with this is the burden of the dual roles\nexperienced by women in Social Democratic states. A high\nproportion of women work and, although public policy is\nprogressive in terms of childcare and paternity leave, women are\nstill responsible for the majority of domestic work and family\ncare.62 63 Similarly, the suggestion has been made that the dual-\nearner model leads to indirect discrimination against women as all\nwomen, even those very vocationally focused, are treated as\npotential mothers leading to women being put onto parallel\n\u2018\u2018mommy career tracks\u2019\u2019.64 This may partly explain the high sexual\nsegregation at work, and the gender pay gap in the Scandinavian\ncountries that exists between men and women as opposed to\nbetween mothers and others as is the case in other Western\ncountries.64 Perhaps another factor behind the results is the higher\nproportion of lone mothers in Social Democratic states65 who\nexperience worse health than couple mothers.65 Of course, the\nEnglish and Finnish results suggest that these relationships may\nnot be consistent across all countries with high labour market\nparticipation by women. Further analysis using other measures of\nhealth (such as mortality data) would help to explore the\nconsistency of this finding.\nNo significant gender differences in SAH were found in the\nCorporatist countries (Belgium, France and Germany), or in\nIreland. The Corporatist welfare states are often considered to\noffer a contradictory set of policies and provisions in relation to\nwomen and the family.36 54 55 58\u201361 On the one hand, they provide\nsome of the best provisions for women (eg, well-compensated\nand extensive maternity leave) whereas, on the other hand, they\nhave much lower levels of labour market participation by\nwomen.36 58\u201361 The lack of gender difference in SAH could\ntherefore reflect the fact that fewer women in the Corporatist\ncountries experience dual roles. Similarly, there are lower levels\nof lone motherhood in the Corporatist countries (and Ireland).\nConversely, the cases of Italy, Portugal and, albeit to a lesser\nextent, Spain caution that restrictive traditional gender roles for\nwomen can have an extremely adverse effect on gender\ndifferences in health.\nTable 1 Information on data sources for each country (presented by\nwelfare state regime)*\nCountry Data source Year(s) of survey\nSocial Democratic\nDenmark Danish Health and Morbidity Survey 2000\nFinland Finbalt Health Monitor 1994, 1998, 2000, 2002,\n2004\nHolland General social survey 2003\u20132004\nNorway Norwegian Survey of Living Conditions 2002\nSweden Swedish Survey of Living Conditions 2000\u20132001\nCorporatist\nBelgium Health Interview Survey 1997\u20132001\nFrance French Health, Health Care and Insurance\nSurvey\n2004\nGermany German National Health Examination and\nInterview Survey\n1998\nLiberal\nEngland Health Survey for England 2001\nIreland Living in Ireland Panel Survey 1995\u20132002\nSouthern\nItaly Health conditions and use of health services 1999\u20132000\nPortugal National Health Survey 2001\nSpain National Health Survey 2001\n*Source: www.eurothine.org.\nTable 2 ORs and 95% CIs for the association of gender\nwith the risk of reporting bad or very bad self-assessed\nhealth compared with regular, good or very good self-\nassessed health*\nTotal\nOR (95% CI)\nSocial Democratic\nDenmark 1.23 (1.08 to 1.39)\nFinland 0.85 (0.77 to 0.95)\nHolland 1.44 (1.29 to 1.60)\nNorway 1.51 (1.23 to 1.87)\nSweden 1.23 (1.06 to 1.44)\nCorporatist\nBelgium 1.09 (0.94 to 1.27)\nFrance 1.15 (0.95 to 1.38)\nGermany 1.13 (1.00 to 1.29)\nLiberal\nEngland 0.88 (0.78 to 0.99)\nIreland 0.93 (0.77 to 1.12)\nSouthern\nItaly 1.33 (1.27 to 1.39)\nPortugal 2.01 (1.87 to 2.15)\nSpain 1.37 (1.23 to 1.53)\n*ORs are age adjusted; men are the reference category for all\ncomparisons.\nResearch report\n40 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:38\u201344. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.070292\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nWelfare state regimes and gender inequality in health\nIn terms of gender differences in SAH stratified by educational\nrank, it is of note that there appears to be a stronger relationship\nin the most educated group for a number of European countries.\nFor example, in the Southern regime countries of Italy and\nPortugal (but not Spain), the increased risk of poor SAH in\nwomen appeared to be greatest among the most highly educated.\nThis may be a result of tensions between the traditional roles of\nwomen as wife and mother and the new pressures for women,\nparticularly the most educated, to work. Indeed, there are large\neducation-related differences in labour force participation among\nSouthern European women; participation is generally higher\namong women of higher education,66 67 whereas lower educated\nwomen generally assume more traditional role patterns66 and\nconform to the Mediterranean \u2018\u2018male breadwinner model\u2019\u2019.68\nTraditional cultural norms and corresponding state provision\n(minimal or no childcare support, etc, in part due to the later\ndevelopment of the welfare state) in the Southern regime\ncountries therefore do not support these dual roles.68 The higher\nprevalence of smoking among more educated women in the\nSouthern regime countries may also be a contributory factor.69\nThis was also the case in Social Democratic Sweden.\nHowever, in Finland, women in the highest group reported better\nSAH than men. In the other Social Democratic countries\n(Denmark, Holland and Norway), there was no clear relationship\nbetween the increased risk of poor SAH in women and\neducational rank. In England, the reduced risk of poor SAH\nreported by women was only among the least educated. Although\nit is possible to explain the higher rates of poor SAH among more\neducated women in terms of the pressures of these women\u2019s dual\nroles, the results are inconsistent and are therefore difficult to\nexplain in a coherent way without further research.\nPolicy implications\nOur results suggest that the nature of gender differences in\nhealth vary by country and to some extent by welfare state\ntype. Therefore, achieving gender equity in health will require\ndifferent policy responses in each European welfare state.\nThe results for the Social Democratic welfare states suggest\nthat welfarist policies cannot adequately overcome gender-\nbased inequities in health without accompanying changes at the\ncultural and societal levels. To start, we suggest implementing\npolicies which target gender socialisation and traditional gender\nroles. A good example of such policies would be the\nrecommendations of the Swedish Education Ministry\u2019s\nDelegation for Gender Equality in Preschool.69 70 The results\nfor Italy and Portugal reinforce this suggestion, as the tension\nbetween traditional and modern roles experienced by women in\nthese countries is detrimental to SAH.\nThe lack of gender differences in SAH in the Corporatist\ncountries and our suggestion that this may be due to the\nexistence of more dual couples and fewer dual roles for women\nimplies that public policy interventions need to compensate more\nadequately for the lack of support experienced by lone mothers\nand by working women in general. Current state provision, even\nin the Social Democratic countries, has not yet adequately\nFigure 1 ORs and 95% CIs for the\nassociation of gender (stratified by\neducational rank) with the risk of\nreporting bad or very bad self-assessed\nhealth compared with regular, good or\nvery good self-assessed health.

There are some\nindications in our analysis that, in a variety of countries, the\nincreased risk of poor SAH in women appeared to be greatest in\nthe highest educational rank. This may also necessitate policy\ninterventions to support women with dual roles.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe EUROTHINE project provides the unique opportunity to\ncompare gender differences in health across Europe using large,\nrepresentative cross-sections of the adult population.\nComparisons are made easier by the use of standardised\nclassifications of important variables (eg, educational rank).\nHowever, national-level data cannot be used to make predic-\ntions at the level of the individual.\nOne limitation is the use of educational rank as a proxy for\nsocioeconomic position. This relationship is unlikely to be\nuniform across all European countries. Furthermore, and of\nparticular importance for this study, women\u2019s educational\nbackground may not be a very accurate indicator of their\nsocioeconomic position. Indeed, research into socioeconomic\ninequalities in health among men and women have highlighted\nthe sensitivity of the choice of indicator of socioeconomic\nposition.2 A further issue concerns the possibility that within\nwelfare regimes there could be direct, differential effects of\ndifferent educational systems on gender inequalities in health.\nAlthough SAH correlates well with other indicators of\nmorbidity71 and is considered to be a good indicator to compare\nhealth across countries,72 it should be acknowledged that there\nmay well be differences in reporting across countries, cultures,\nethnicity, socioeconomic groups and, of course, by gender.73 It is\nalso likely that there are variations in SAH between age groups,\nand different welfare state regimes will have policies that act\ndifferentially at various stages in the life cycle as well as by\ngender. For example, gender differences in health also differ by\noccupational characteristics74 and younger women may be more\nlikely to live with their parents; occupation could therefore be\nan important confounding factor.75 Similarly, the institutiona-\nlisation of older people may vary by gender in different\ncountries. Future research would benefit from examining SAH\nbetween different age groups (as well as the interaction between\ngender and other forms of social stratification such as ethnicity)\nto ascertain whether the patterns reported here vary by age as\nwell as by welfare state regime and level of education.\nAnother possible limitation is our choice of welfare state\nregime typology. There are a multitude of competing welfare\nstate regime typologies9 and, although there is no categorisation\nwhich has been generally accepted as the standard typology, the\nfourfold typology of Ferrera33 used in this paper has been\nhighlighted as one of the most empirically accurate,34 at least in\nterms of how social benefits are granted and organised.\nHowever, if the typologies of other authors were used the\nresults may have been different. For example, if the political\ntraditions typology suggested by Navarro et al7 were utilised, the\nChristian Democratic group of countries (similar to Bismarckian\nregime) would include those with smaller gender inequalities\n(Germany, France) as well as those with higher gender inequal-\nities (Italy). This needs to be taken into borne in mind when\nconsidering our results.\nCONCLUSION\nCurrent welfare regime theory clearly offers some explanatory\ninsight into gender differences in health. However, until more\nwork on the gendered nature of welfare states has been\nundertaken and is available for use by public health researchers,\nregime theory may not be as useful in examining gender and\nhealth as it has been in terms of overall population health.3\u20137\nOne obvious route to pursue relates to relationships between\ngender inequalities in health and gendered public policy\nindicators and typologies, such as the Gender Equity Index.76\nWhat is already known on this subject\nc International research has shown that different types of\nwelfare states (welfare state regimes) are important\ndeterminants of health and health inequalities as they mediate\nthe extent, and impact, of socioeconomic position on health.\nc To date, however, no studies have examined how gender\ndifferences in health vary by welfare state regime. Similarly,\nthere are few cross-national studies of inequalities in health\nwhich examine gender differences by welfare state type.\nWhat this study adds\nc The relationship between gender and self-assessed health\nvaries by welfare state\u2014in the majority of cases, women\nreported worse health than men.\nc Women in the Social Democratic and Southern welfare states\nwere more likely to report worse self-assessed health than\nmen. In the Corporatist countries, there were no gender\ndifferences in self-assessed health. Findings were mixed for\nthe Liberal regime countries.\nc There was no consistent welfare state regime patterning for\ngender differences in self-assessed health by socioeconomic\nposition. Although, in some countries (Italy, Portugal,\nSweden), women\u2019s relatively worse self-assessed health\ntended to be most prominent in the group with the highest\nlevel of education.\nPolicy implications\nc The policy implications of the study are that policies which\ntarget gender socialisation and traditional gender roles need to\nbe implemented more extensively in all welfare state regimes.\nc Traditional welfarist policies (eg, income redistribution) cannot\nadequately overcome gender-based inequities in health\nwithout accompanying changes at the cultural and societal\nlevels. Policies which target gender socialisation and\ntraditional gender roles, such as the recommendations of the\nSwedish Education Ministry\u2019s Delegation for Gender Equality\nin Preschool, may be beneficial in this regard.\nc Public policy interventions need to compensate more\nadequately for the lack of support experienced by working\nwomen. This may require more extensive socialised childcare,\nas well as enhanced flexibility around working hours.\nResearch report\n42 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:38\u201344. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.070292\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank all those involved in the EUROTHINE\nresearch collaboration (www.eurothine.org), particularly those involved in assembling\nthe data set upon which this paper is based.\nCompeting interests: None.\nREFERENCES\n1.
