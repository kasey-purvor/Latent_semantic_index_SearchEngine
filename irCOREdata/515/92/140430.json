Such component interaction effects, \nshould be assessed and thus be taken into account, during the \npreliminary design phase of the compressor. Alternatively, \ndesign modifications may need to be introduced to an existing \ncompressor design that is installed behind a new duct design. \nThe aim in this former case is to prevent compressor \nperformance degradation due to installation effects. \nCompressor upstream components affect the compressor \nperformance in two distinct ways: i) Flow-field thermodynamic \nand momentum distortion, ii) Boundary layer ingestion. There \nhas been a vast amount of research effort being invested in the \npast, in order to predict the impact of the flow field distortion \non compressor performance. References [1,2,3] are just a few \ncitations in the field. On the other hand compressor key design \nvariables like the blade lean angle [4,5], have also been \nassessed on the basis of their impact on compressor \nperformance.  \nThe current paper addresses the effect of the blade lean \nangle on an axial compressor\u2019s performance as well as the \ncompressor\u2019s response to the blockage introduced by the \ningested boundary layer. These effects are firstly examined \nseparately against a reference datum. Subsequently their \nsuperimposed impact is compared against their cumulative \nimpact on compressor performance. \nThe work was carried out using SOCRATES a 2D SLC \nbased, compressor performance prediction and design tool. \nGiven the character of the tool, a fast in-viscid flow solver \nincorporating phenomenological models, only the qualitative \nvalue of the results can be appreciated. Nonetheless, it remains \na valuable tool indicating compressor performance trends \nduring the preliminary design phase, providing thus the designer \nwith important information for compressor candidate design \nrefinement. \n \n2    STREAMLINE CURVATURE METHOD. \n \nSLC is a well established through-flow calculation method, \nhaving its origins back to the early fifties [6]. It combines the \nlow computational time for convergence due to the nature of the \nflow being considered (compressible, in-viscid, 2-D flow), with \nresults of adequate engineering accuracy, depending on the set \nof phenomenological models being used. Flow solvers based on \nthis method, and similar through-flow calculation methods gain \nnowadays increasing attention as they tend to substitute \ntraditional 0-D tools for compressor preliminary design. \nA through-flow solver belongs to the category of SLC \nsolvers when it solves the REE stemming from the application \nof Newton\u2019s second law of motion along a particular direction \non a differential flow volume of an in-viscid flow. SLC solvers \nended up to consist a category of such methods on their own, \nbecause there were several deviations concerning the solution \ngrid definitions, the parallel use of other fundamental laws, the \nform of the REE and even the mathematical solution scheme. A \nmore profound insight in SLC method and its derivatives, is \ngiven in [7]. \n \n3   SIMULATION TOOL. \n \nThe 2D SLC Compressor Software [7,8,9,10], precursor of \nSOCRATES was used as the flow field simulation tool. It solves \nthe following general form of the REE:  \n \ncossintan\ncossin\ncos2\ntansin2\n1\ntan\ncos\nsin\n1\nsinsin\ncos\nsin\ntansin\n2\n2\ndm\ndS\nT\nds\ndS\nT\nds\ndI\nW\nds\nrWd\nr\nW\nrdm\nrWd\nV\nr\ndm\nd\nr\nds\nd\ndm\nd\nV\nds\ndV\nV\nw\nww\nw\nm\nc\nm\nm\nm\n  (1) \n \nwhich is basically a second order linear differential equation \nwith respect to the meridional velocity of the following form: \n \nCBVAV\nds\ndV\nV mm\nm\nm\n2     (2) \n \nwhere A, B and C constants are as follows: \n \ncrdm\nd\nrds\nd\ndm\nd\nA\ncos\nsin\n1\nsinsin\ncos\nsin\ntansin\n   (3) \n \ntansin2\n1\ntan\nrdm\nrWd\nB w    (4) \n \n   \n3 \ncossintan\ncossin\ncos2\n2\ndm\ndS\nT\nds\ndS\nT\nds\ndI\nW\nds\nrWd\nr\nW\nC\nw\nww\n  (5) \n \n \n \nFig. 1:  Meridional plane vector \u2013 angle definition. \n \ni\n\u03b21\n\u03b22\n\u03b4\n \nFig 2: Blade angle definition. \n \nConcerning the current version of the code the following \nfeatures have been incorporated: \n Dynamic adaptation of the computational grid, taking place \nin-between iterations, to support fast and stable \nconvergence. \n Extension of the solution scheme to cover duct flow \ncalculations upstream or downstream of the compressor. \nMore details are given in section 4.2. \n Inclusion of a sophisticated dynamic convergence control \nsubroutine.  \n Development of a graphical user interface in order to \nenhance the friendliness of the code against the user. \nAngle and vector definitions are demonstrated on figures 1 \nand 2. \n4   CASE STUDY \n \n4.1 Geometry Definition \nThe current case study is based on the compressor \ngeometry given in NASA TP 1493 report [11]. It concerns a two \nstage axial fan (Figure 3, Table 1). \n \n  \nFig. 3: Two stage fan geometry. \n \nThe fan is fitted with a generic divergent intake duct, with an \narea ratio of 0,7 and a total length of 26 cm (Figure 4).  \n \n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40\nDistance from 1st rotor inlet at the hub [cm]\nD\nis\nta\nn\nc\ne\n f\nro\nm\n c\no\nm\np\nre\ns\ns\no\nr \na\nx\nis\n [\nc\nm\n]\n \nFig. 4: Intake Compressor geometry. \n \n \nPressure  Ratio 2.399 \nIsentropic Efficiency 0.849 \nMass Flow [kg\/sec] 33.248 \nRPM 16042.80 \nInlet Hub-Tip Ratio 0.375 \n \nTable 1: Two-stage fan design overall parameters [11] \n \n4.2 Solution Scheme \nThe REE is solved over the boundaries of each blade row \n(blade leading and trailing edge), as well as along quasi-\northogonal paths within the duct, in order to determine a \nmeridional radial velocity distribution. \nDuring the first iteration and before the flow-field \ncalculation starts, there exists an assumed velocity distribution \nthroughout the compressor as well as a distribution of \nthermodynamic properties. Consequently, subroutines \ncontaining phenomenological models can run individually on a \n   \n4 \nseparate module to produce a set of empirical factors which are \nthen fed to the next iteration. In figure 5 the initial \ncomputational grid is demonstrated.  \nComputational Grid\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n-30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40\nDistance from 1st rotor inlet at the hub [cm]\nD\nis\nta\nn\nc\ne\n f\nro\nm\n c\no\nm\np\nre\ns\ns\no\nr \na\nx\nis\n \n[c\nm\n]\n \nFig. 5: Intake - Compressor geometry grid. \n \nA set of boundary conditions (total temperature, total \npressure, absolute Mach number and absolute flow angle) are \nspecified at the intake throat. There are no specific boundary \nconditions specified at the compressor outlet plane. The \nposition of streamlines is fixed across the inlet plane. Varying \nthe inlet Mach number distribution, a range of mass flow values \nalong a constant speed line may be obtained. Finally an extra \nboundary condition is specified: the blockage factor value that \naccounts for the boundary layer ingested into the intake.  \n \n4.3 Case Study Phenomenological Models \nAs mentioned in section 3, all necessary input data for the \nempirical models are readily available in between iterations. \nThe development of the code from now on is split in two \nparallel modules. The first one deals with the in-viscid flow \ncalculation and the second, consisting a stand-alone separate \nmodule, provides the in-viscid solver with the empirical factors \nin order for the viscous nature of the flow to be introduced. In \nsolution it should be mentioned that each empirical models \npackage, should be complete in terms of viscous effects \ndescription, as the in-viscid part of the code will only use one \nsuch package during execution. The code had to be structured \nin such a way, because there is not a universally acceptable \nbook keeping system of the losses. In other words, \nphenomenological models modules, cannot exchange specific \nmodels (the profile loss model for instance between two \ndifferent modules) in order to avoid confusions.  \nConcerning the current case study the phenomenological \nmodel module contains the following set of empirical models: \n For the blade incidence minimum loss calculation, \nLieblein\u2019s (1965) approach is adopted. [12]. \n For the blade minimum loss deviation calculation, Carter\u2019s \nrule was used [13]. \n The calculation of the off-design deviation angle was done \naccording to Creveling [14]. \n For the determination of losses the approach given by \nMiller [15] was adopted. According to Miller et al., it is \nassumed that the total pressure loss of the blade row is the \nresult of the interaction of different loss components, i.e. \nprofile losses, secondary losses and shock losses, which are \nconsidered to act through independent mechanisms. Each \nmechanism is reflected by a corresponding loss factor and \nthe total loss factor is given by their sum. Blade profile loss \nis determined according to Swan\u2019s model, [16] the shock \nlosses are calculated as described by Schwenk [17] and \nsecondary losses are determined according to Griepentrog\u2019s \napproach. [18]. \n The end wall boundary layer calculations for both the \nbladed and bladeless space are being performed according \nto the model described in reference [19]  \n \n4.4 Case Study Set Up \nTable 2 summarizes the boundary conditions of the case \nstudy under context. Radial distribution for all the parameters is \nassumed constant since the impact of radially distorted \nconditions at the intake throat plane does not interest the current \nstudy. Mach number range is determined on the basis of \nestablishing a safe mass flow window well contained between \nchocking and surge boundaries. Compressor speed was held \nconstant in all cases and equal to approximately 8000 rpm. A \npart load condition has been selected given the fact that this is a \nvery demanding case scenario from the simulation point of \nview. Blockage factor range was taken quite wide in order to \ncover any extreme case of boundary layer separation due to \nshock presence, steep climb conditions, etc. Additionally the \nstudy aimed to address to qualitative response of the \ncompressor and it did not necessarily referred to an actual case. \nFinally the compressor blade lean angle was varied between 5 \ndegrees of backward (suction blade surface facing the upper \ncasing wall) to 5 degrees of forward (pressure blade surface \nfacing the upper casing wall) leaned blades, for both \ncompressor stages (see figure 6 for lean angle definition). In all \ncases the theoretical reference datum is considered to be the \ncase of 0 lean angle and a blockage factor of 1 (no blockage). \n \nTotal Temperature 288 K \nTotal Pressure 1,013 bar \nMach Number 0,5 \u2013 0,7 \nAir Absolute Angle 0 deg \nBlockage Factor 1 \u2013 0,96 \nInlet Hub-Tip Ratio 0.375 \n \nTable 2: Intake Throat Boundary Conditions \n \n   \n5 \n\u03bb\nw\nz\nr\n \n \nFig. 6: Lean angle definition. \n \n \n4.5 Case Study\u2019s Solver Validation. \nThe solver has been validated against radial meridional \nvelocity profiles, for both viscid and in-viscid operating modes. \nThe experimental reference results were taken from NASA TP \n1493 report [11] for the setting of around 8000 rpm. In order to \nvalidate the in-viscid operating mode the loss factors appearing \nin the experimental set of data were used excluding thus from \nthe simulation the phenomenological models\u2019 effects (Figures \n7,8). \nMeridional Velocity Profile Blade Leading Edge\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0 50 100 150\nMeridional Velocity [m\/s]\nR\na\nd\nia\nl \nL\no\nc\na\nti\no\nn\n [\nm\n]\nEXP R1 EXP S1 EXP R2 EXP S2\nSLC R1 SLC S1 SLC R2 SLC S2\n \nFig. 7: Leading edge meridional velocity profiles comparison \nbetween experimental data and in-viscid solver \nMeridional Velocity Profile Blade Trailing Edge\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0 50 100 150 200\nMeridional Velocity [m\/s]\nR\na\nd\nia\nl \nL\no\nc\na\nti\no\nn\n [\nm\n]\nEXP R1 EXP S1 EXP R2 EXP S2\nSLC R1 SLC S1 SLC R2 SLC S2\n \nFig. 8: Trailing edge meridional velocity profiles comparison \nbetween experimental data and in-viscid solver \n \n \nMeridional Velocity Profile Blade Leading Edge\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0 50 100 150 200\nMeridional Velocity [m\/s]\nR\na\nd\nia\nl \nL\no\nc\na\nti\no\nn\n [\nm\n]\nEXP R1 EXP S1 EXP R2 EXP S2\nSLC S1 SLC S1 SLC R2 SLC S2\n \nFig. 9: Leading edge meridional velocity profiles comparison \nbetween experimental data and phenomenological module. \n \n \n   \n6 \nMeridional Velocity Profile Blade Trailing Edge\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\n0 50 100 150 200\nMeridional Velocity [m\/s]\nR\na\nd\nia\nl \nL\no\nc\na\nti\no\nn\n [\nm\n]\nEXP R1 EXP S1 EXP R2 EXP S2\nSLC R1 SLC S1 SLC R2 SLC S2\n \nFig. 10: The trailing edge meridional velocity profiles \ncomparison between experimental data and phenomenological \nmodule \n \n \n \nFig. 11: Loss factor comparison \u2013 1st stage stator \n \nAs a second step, the loss factors were calculated according \nto the models presented earlier and the corresponding results \nregarding the meridional velocity profiles are presented in \nfigures 9 and 10. The 1st\u2019s row stator loss factors (figure 11) are \nshown, as an indicative case as to how calculated and \nexperimental values compare to each other. Comparison shows \nan adequate agreement especially in the mid-span blade region. \nThe great deviations spotted at the far extreme points at the \nblade root and tip regions, are due to the fact that measured \nvalues come from within the boundary layer where profile loss \nmodels usually perform the worse. \nAs far as the in-viscid mode is concerned, it can be seen \nthat agreement between calculated and experimental meridional \nvelocity profiles is very satisfactory. The quantitative trends are \ncaptured at all positions, including the sharp turns on the \nvelocity curves which usually cause convergence instabilities. \nConcerning the performance of the set of phenomenological \nmodels, despite the fact that the compressor is simulated away \nfrom the design point, results were also satisfactory. The biggest \ndeviations between the two profiles were recognized to be at the \nleading and trailing edge of the last stator. This does not \nnecessarily means that the models perform the worst over this \nlast compressor blade row. Certain percentage of this mismatch \ncomes as a cumulative error of the upstream rows. \nConvergence time for both cases did not exceed 30 seconds \nfor a 21 streamline setting and an error tolerance for stream-\ntube mass flow at the level of 10\n-4\n. The total number of \niterations (an iteration here is defined as a complete calculation \nthroughout the compressor) in the first case was 8, where as for \nthe later case where the loss factors were calculated by the \nphenomenological models module, the code needed 13 \niterations before convergence was achieved. The code run in a \ncore duo Pentium, 1,8 MHz processor. \n \n5   DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS \n \n5.1 Lean Angle Variation \nLean angle was varied in the circumferential direction as \nshown in figure 6. Backward leaning is defined when the \nsuction surface is facing on the end-wall. Lean angle was set to \n5 degrees for both cases, a constant value for all blade rows. \nThe reference line for this case was the compressor \nperformance for zero lean angle (unleaned blades). Mass flow \nwas again varied through the intake throat Mach number \nvariation over the same range as it was done for the case of \nblockage factor variation.  A thorough study concerning the \neffect of blade lean angle on a transonic fan is given in \nreference [5]. Compressor setting, number of streamlines and \nstream-tube mass flow tolerances were the same as in the case \nof blockage factor variation. Total number of iterations and \nconvergence times were also at the same level. The results are \ndemonstrated on figures 12 and 13.  \nQualitative trends of the pressure ratio curves were in \naccordance to these given in [5] by Denton and Xu, produced \nfor an axial fan by a 3D multistage viscous solver. Forward \nleaning caused a reduction in pressure ratio, being much more \npronounced than the corresponding increase caused in pressure \nratio, by the opposite lean angle setting. Deviations of \nefficiency curves are expected to arise from blade loading \nalternations, based on flow turning. In this specific case \nbackward lean did not push the compressor to operate into the \narea of increased profile losses. On the other hand forward \nleaning demonstrated, over the entire mass flow range, a \nreduction in efficiency which is magnified in higher pressure \nratios where velocities are also higher.  \n \n   \n7 \nLean Angle Variation\n1\n1.02\n1.04\n1.06\n1.08\n1.1\n1.12\n1.14\n1.16\n1.18\n1.2\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nMass Flow [kg\/s]\nP\nre\ns\ns\nu\nre\n R\na\nti\no\nForward Lean 5 deg\n0\nBackward Lean 5 deg\n \nFig. 12: Compressor characteristic \u2013 Pressure ratio for lean \nangle variation. \nLean Angle Variation\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n16.5 17 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5\nMass Flow [kg\/s]\nP\no\nly\ntr\no\np\nic\n E\nff\nic\nie\nn\nc\ny\nForward Lean 5 deg\n0\nBackward lean 5 deg\n \nFig. 13: The Compressor characteristic \u2013 Polytropic Efficiency \nfor lean angle variation. \n \n5.2 Blockage Factor Variation \nBlockage factor at the intake throat was varied from 1 to \n0,96. The Mach number over the same plane was varied from \n0,5 to 0,7 to get the range of mass flow appearing on the graphs \n(Figure 14 and 15). Calculation without flow blockage \n(blockage factor equals to 1), is used as the reference line. \nPressure ratio at a certain mass flow setting, is eventually \nreduced due to the higher axial velocities caused by the reduced \nflow area. The simulation was not pushed towards the surge \nregion of the map, as it was not a subject of interest for the \ncurrent study. \nAnother qualitative remark worth mentioning is that the \nrange of pressure ratios at the left end of the curves is narrower \nthan the corresponding range at the right end. This can be \njustified by the great variation of polytropic efficiency at higher \nmass flows. It should be barred in mind that losses at these \ncompressor settings, where Mach numbers are well below \ncritical value, are principally due to profile losses. A higher \nvelocity variation caused at higher mass flows, is mainly \nresponsible for the deviation of the efficiency curves. In all \ncases variations in pressure ratio did not exceed 5% reduction. \nConvergence was achieved after 13 to max 33 iterations \ndepending on the case, demonstrating a maximum convergence \ntime of no more than 1 minute in a core duo Pentium, 1,8 MHz \nprocessor. Twenty one streamlines were used to cover the \ncompressor annulus and the convergence tolerance for the \nstream-tube mass flows was set to 10\n-4\n. \n \n \nBlockage Factor Variation\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\n1.2\n1.25\n15 15.5 16 16.5 17 17.5 18 18.5 19\nMass Flow [kg\/s]\nP\nre\ns\ns\nu\nre\n R\na\nti\no\nBF 0.98 BF 0.96\nBF 0.97 BF 0.99\nBF 1.00\n \nFig. 14: Compressor characteristic \u2013 Pressure ratio for \nblockage factor variation. \n \n \nBlockage Factor Variation\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n15 15.5 16 16.5 17 17.5 18 18.5 19\nMass Flow [kg\/s]\nP\no\nly\ntr\no\np\nic\n E\nff\nic\nie\nn\nc\ny\nBF 0.98 BF 0.96 BF 0.97\nBF 0.99 BF 1.00\n \nFig. 15: The Compressor characteristic \u2013 Polytropic Efficiency \nfor blockage factor variation. \n \n5.3 Combined Lean Angle Blockage Effect. \nThe last section of this blockage factor \u2013 lean angle \nparametric study, regards the additive and the cumulative effect \nof the above mentioned parameters. Figure 16 demonstrates the \npressure ratio vs. mass flow trends of the two following cases: i) \nBased on the results of two independently examined cases, 0,98 \nblockage factor and 5 degrees of forward leaning, the \u201cadditive\u201d \n   \n8 \ncurve was drawn by simply adding algebraically the differences \nthat each case demonstrated from the datum case, (blockage \nfactor equal to 1 and lean angle equal to 0) and ii) the \n\u201ccumulative\u201d curve coming as a direct output of SOCRATES \nfor 0,98 blockage factor and 5 degrees backward leaned blades. \nThe values of blockage factor and lean angle were chosen under \nthe criterion of anticipating the flow blockage effect by the \nleaning of the blades. The important conclusion that can be \ndrawn from this study, is that for the \u201ccumulative\u201d case the \npressure ratio gain by the leaned blades was slightly lower as \nopposed to what would someone expect by simply adding the \ndifferences. However differences were generally marginal \nmeaning that as far as these two effects is concerned, they can \nbe investigated individually and then simply add algebraically \nthe corresponding effects.  \n \nCumulative Lean Angle Blockage Effect\n1.02\n1.04\n1.06\n1.08\n1.1\n1.12\n1.14\n1.16\n1.18\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20\nMass Flow [kg\/s]\nP\nre\ns\ns\nu\nre\n R\na\nti\no\n0.98 BF - 0 Deg\n1 BF - 5 Deg Backward\nLean Additive\nDatum\n0.98 BF - 5 Deg Backward\nLean Cumulative\n \nFig. 16: Cumulative lean angle blockage effect on compressor \nperformance. \n \n6   CONCLUSIONS \nThe current study was based on an experimental two stage \nfan running at approximately 8000 rpm, fitted downstream of an \naxi-symmetric divergent duct. The study aimed to investigate \nboth the independent and the cumulative effect of an axial \ncompressor blade lean angle variation against the flow blockage \ngenerated by an upstream duct. Simulations were conducted \nusing SOCRATES a 2D-SLC compressor software, an in-viscid \n2D flow solver incorporating phenomenological models. Both \nmodules, the solver and the models were validated against \nexperimental data on a radial meridional velocity profile basis. \nBoundary conditions were for all simulation cases applied at the \nupstream duct inlet section. The Mach number covered a range \nof 0,5 to 0,7 and the blade span was described by twenty one \nstreamlines in total. The main conclusions drawn out of this \nstudy were the following: \n Validation of the \u201cin-viscid\u201d part of the code, demonstrated \na very satisfying qualitative and quantitative agreement. \n Validation of the specific phenomenological models \nmodule proved that it is adequate for capturing qualitative \ntrends, but actual velocity values, especially close to the \nblade outer regions (hub and tip) deviated quite \nsubstantially.  \n Blockage factor caused a reduction in both pressure ratio \nand efficiency. Those trends were more pronounced at the \nhigh mass flow end of the curves. \n Backward leaning proved to be slightly favorable in terms \nof pressure ratio, whereas forward leaning had the opposite \nand much more pronounced effect. \n The detrimental effect on compressor pressure ratio due to \nintake boundary layer ingestion can be counteracted by \nbackward blade lean. \n Blade lean angle variations and upstream boundary layer \ningestion, as far as the compressor performance is \nconcerned, can be addressed separately and then add the \ncorresponding effects algebraically.  \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1 Longley, J.
