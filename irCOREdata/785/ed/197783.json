Given the realities of organizational life for many of the subjects of leadership discourse, \nhowever, the extent to which leadership retains its current positive associations and ubiquity \nremains to be seen. \nPublished in: Social Science & Medicine 74(3): 281-288 \nhttp:\/\/www.elsevier.com\/locate\/socscimed  \ndoi:10.1007\/s10689-007-9130-3 \nIntroduction \n\u201eLeadership\u201f has been the focus of increasing attention for both policymakers and academics. \nSeen as a key component of organizational success, the popular, policy and academic literatures \non leadership have grown greatly over the last three decades. In the private and public sectors, \nleadership has become more than merely a function within management: it is constructed as \nsomething to be enacted by employees across an organization, not just those at the apex \n(Bryman, 1999). In the public sector in particular, where power is more diffuse and organizational \nobjectives more plural, there has been an increasing emphasis in recent years on the importance \nof spreading leadership qualities across organizations (Hartley & Allison, 2000). Recent British \ngovernments have been particularly strong exponents of this \u201ecall to leadership\u201f (e.g. Cabinet \nOffice, 1999), and the National Health Service (NHS) has been seen much policy rhetoric, and \nfinancial investment, around developing \u201eleadership capacity\u201f (e.g. NHS Institute, 2005). \nMuch contemporary leadership research is concerned with themes such as how leadership \ncan be understood and conceptualized, and how its benefits can best be harnessed by individuals \nand organizations. Thus leadership researchers often draw on debates in the wider social sciences \nto ask whether leadership is best enacted through, for example, \u201etransformational\u201f (Bass, 1985), \n\u201edistributed\u201f (Spillane, 2005; Gronn, 2002), or \u201ecollective\u201f (Denis et al., 2001) approaches. But \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n2 \nwhile there are significant disagreements about its precise nature, it is largely accepted that \nleadership should be treated as a real, empirically distinctive entity. Furthermore, it seems more-\nor-less axiomatic within these debates that leadership (at least when properly practised) is \nbeneficial for individuals and organizations. \nThe idea that leadership is universally beneficial seems holds for most studies of leadership \nin health. Reviewing this field, Gilmartin and D\u201fAunno (2007) draw attention to several \ndistinctive aspects of healthcare delivery (e.g. the existence of \u201cpowerful professionals, especially \nphysicians, who dominate many aspects of day-to-day work in healthcare,\u201d p.390)\u2014distinctive \nfeatures of healthcare which, they contend, add complexities to attempts to transfer leadership \ntheories from elsewhere. Nevertheless, they offer conclusions that resonate with the assumptions \nof mainstream leadership research outlined above. In healthcare, Gilmartin and D\u201fAunno (2007, \np.408) suggest, \u201cleadership is positively and significantly associated with individual and group \nsatisfaction, retention and performance\u201d. Such ideas are echoed in the ways in which healthcare \nprofessionals are asked or aspire to \u201edo\u201f leadership. In the US, for example, the influential \nNational Center for Healthcare Leadership (NCHL) declares that it  \nworks to assure that high quality, relevant and accountable leadership is available to meet \nthe challenges of delivering quality patient healthcare in the 21st century. NCHL\u201fs goal is to \nimprove health system performance and the health status of the entire country through \neffective healthcare management leadership.1  \nIn contrast to these dominant ideas, however, a small but increasingly influential body of work is \nemerging within organization studies, which we label \u201ecritical leadership studies\u201f (see, e.g., \nAlvesson & Sveningsson, 2003; Barker, 2001; Ford 2006; Ford et al., 2008; Grint, 2010). Such \nwork, though adopting diverse theoretical orientations, is united by scepticism towards \nleadership\u201fs supposed benefits. Indeed, leadership, as the \u201cprocess whereby one or more \nindividuals succeeds in attempting to frame and define the reality of others\u201d (Smircich & Morgan, \n1982, p.257), is generally seen as a nefarious political project, one concerned with facilitating \nsubtle forms of control: leaders seducing their followers into accepting what may not be in their \ninterests. One response of some critical leadership scholars in resisting its seductive appeal is to \nfocus less on what leadership is and more on what it does. \nHere, in this vein, we critically consider the rise of \u201eleadership\u201f in NHS discourse, over the \nlast 10-15 years in particular, drawing on ideas from the critical leadership literature. We ask: what \nare the consequences\u2014for individual healthcare staff, and for healthcare policy and practice as a \nwhole\u2014of labelling things \u201eleadership\u201f? In doing so, we draw on empirical fieldwork conducted \nwith NHS managers in the 1990s, and then key policy documents produced from the late 1990s \nto the present. We highlight a shift in the terminology used to refer to \u201eadministration\u201f, then \n\u201emanagement\u201f, then \u201eleadership\u201f in the NHS.  We note an expansion in the ways in which the \nterm \u201eleadership\u201f is applied in the policy literature, as an attribute not just of formal \nleaders\/managers, but to an increasingly plural set of stakeholders, including clinicians and even \npatients and the public. We illustrate how this policy focus on leadership might be understood as \nseeking to affect the work and even the subjectivities of health-service professionals and other \nactors (such as patients and the public). By \u201esubjectivities\u201f, we mean individuals\u201f senses of \nthemselves, their biographies and their personal trajectories. These we understand, following \nKnights and Willmott (1989, p.537), as neither essential and innate to the individual, nor \nexternally imposed by social structure, but rather produced through \u201cinvolvement in relations of \npower through which conceptions of identity are generated.\u201d As such, subjectivity is not \u201cthat \ncreative autonomy or personal space not yet captured by political economy\u201d (p.549), but is rather \n\u201cintimately bound to power\/knowledge relations which traverse both the subjects and (what are \nconventionally seen as) social structures\u201d (Newton, 1998, p.418). Our concern here, then, is with \n                                                 \n1 http:\/\/www.nchl.org\/static.asp?path=2887, accessed 23 August 2010. \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n3 \nwhat leadership does\u2014or might do\u2014to the subjectivities of NHS staff. \nIn particular, we highlight how health-service staff are increasingly represented not just as \nthe objects of policy interventions, but as subjects implicated in policy design. We suggest that claims \nmade by health policy about the engagement of professionals as leaders in the design and delivery \nof reform are best understood as efforts to reconstitute these actors\u201f subjectivities: a co-optive \nmeans of \u201egoverning at a distance\u201f that complements more coercive modes of rule such as \nperformance management and associated surveillance regimes. \nMethods \nOur paper draws, in sequence, on two sources. First, we offer an analysis of empirical material: \ninterviews with 16 NHS hospital chief executives, conducted by ML in 1998-1999. Each \ninterview lasted 45-60 minutes and was audio-taped and transcribed. Participants had agreed to \nbe interviewed in the context of research investigating how NHS chief executives make sense of \ntheir professional world. Interviews were framed by an opening question\u2014\u201cWhat do you see as \nthe heart of your job?\u201d\u2014and proceeded to roam across a wide set of topics in a fluid, informal \nmanner. This process produced a dataset of about 110,000 words. Our analytical focus on \n\u201eadministration\u201f, \u201emanagement\u201f and \u201eleadership\u201f was prompted by a striking feature of many \ninterviews. As a preliminary to the interviews, primarily to contextualize their answers, each \nrespondent was invited to describe her\/his professional background. An exchange such as this \nwas typical: \nI came into the health service as, at that stage, a career administrator, straight from \nuniversity; onto the administrators\u201f training scheme and moved into management, as \nmanagement developed in the NHS. \nTheir initial emphasis on administration having been succeeded by management led to a search \nfor other references to \u201eadministration\u201f, \u201emanagement\u201f and \u201eleadership\u201f within the transcripts (for \nfull methodological details, see Learmonth, 2005). Thus we consider how participants \nconstructed their roles in terms of administration, management and leadership. Our analysis is \nframed by an understanding of language, and of particular signifiers, as (at least partially) \nperformative: where performative language, following Royle (2000, p.9) is language that \u201cdoes \nsomething, in actuality, in reality, with reality.\u201d This analysis highlights in particular how \nparticipants spoke about \u201emanagement\u201f and \u201eleadership\u201f in largely coterminous ways\u2014leadership \nand management are more-or-less synonymous, in a way which seems curiously outdated only \njust over a decade later. \nThese findings prompted us to investigate the development of leadership discourse in \nofficial policy in the intervening period. Our second set of sources is therefore major NHS policy \ndocuments produced by the Department of Health (DoH) from around the time of the interview \ndata through to the present day. We considered all DoH command papers published since 1997 \n(including white papers\u2014statements of policy\u2014and green papers\u2014more formative \nconsultation\/discussion documents) relating to the NHS as a whole, and excluded those which \nrelated to social care, particular clinical areas, and particular professions. Together, these \ncommand papers represent the most important statements of NHS direction over the period in \nquestion. This period saw a number of wider changes in NHS policy that might influence the \nconstruction of leadership: an initial focus on top-down reform in the period 1997-2000 was \ndisplaced by a return to market mechanisms in from 2001 onward (Klein, 2006). From 2008, the \nemphasis shifted further, towards quality as an organising and defining principle in the NHS, to \nbe achieved through professionally led change. We chose our cut-off date of 1997 for three \nreasons, pragmatic and substantive: first, it coincided roughly with the date of the interviews, and \nso documents published at this time would have informed the views of the chief executives \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n4 \ninterviewed in the late 1990s; second, a new Labour government was elected in 1997 which \npromised to modernize public services including the NHS, and which saw \u201ebetter leadership\u201f as a \nkey means of achieving this (Parker, 2004); third, from around this time web-based HTML \nand\/or PDF versions of all white and green papers became available, assisting our sampling and \nanalysis. In addition to command papers, we also included High Quality Care for All, the final \nreport of the NHS Next Stage Review, which is not a white or green paper, but which forms a \ncentral part of current NHS policy and future plans, especially in relation to improving quality \nthrough professionally led change. \nFor each of the policy documents included in this set of sources (Secretary of State for \nHealth [hereafter SoSH] 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004a&b, 2006, 2008) (see Table 1), \nwe undertook an analysis process which consisted of a careful reading and rereading of the \ndocuments as a whole, followed by keyword searches for three key terms: admin*, manag* and \nlead*. We then read the text around these terms with three key questions in mind: what is meant \nby this term; what it asks NHS stakeholders (managers, clinicians, patients) to do; and what role it \nascribes to these stakeholders. Our analysis was framed by these questions with a view to \nuncovering the discursive function of leadership and associated terms, and also paid attention to \nthe chronology of the documents, seeking to highlight shifts in terminology and evolutions in the \nway these terms have been deployed. \nThis approach was taken with a view to ensuring systematicity and transparency in our \ntreatment of the documents and analysis of data, but as with any such discursively oriented \napproach, it is one which also rests on interpretation, and thus on our subject positions as \nauthors. Two consequences of this in particular should be broached. Firstly, our interpretations \nare not intended to be received as categorical or definitive, and we acknowledge that the texts we \npresent can be understood in various ways. We offer our interpretations in the belief that the \nsocial world is inherently ambiguous; although we seek to justify our assertions by reference to \nthe texts themselves and the (textual and social) contexts in which these are located, the social \nworld can ultimately only be apprehended subjectively. Secondly, in this paper we juxtapose two \nrather different sources of data: the self-described actions of hospital chief executives of 12 years \nago, and the carefully crafted policy rhetoric of the last 10 years. The former represent \nindividuals\u201f (post hoc accounts of their) views, beliefs and actions. The latter constitute powerful \ndocuments which seek to influence views, beliefs and actions: we cannot infer from them that these \ndocuments have been successful in this attempt to influence. However, we do argue that the \npowerful potential of the discourses contained in these documents is illustrated by the talk of \nchief executives and by other empirical studies, and we suggest some of the consequences this \nYear Title Publication details \n1997 The New NHS: Modern, Dependable.

In particular, we \nhighlight the potential and limits of the discursive potential of \u201emanagement\u201f, suggesting reasons \nwhy it may have been displaced by \u201eleadership\u201f in the intervening period. We then turn to the \npolicy literature from 1997 to the present, and the developing notion of leadership advanced in \nthese documents not just for managers, but for other healthcare actors as well. In the discussion \nand conclusion sections, we consider the interests promoted by these ideas of leadership in NHS \npolicy, and what this might mean for the future of the discourse. \nAdministration, leadership, management \nThere have been striking changes in the way that organizational roles in the NHS have been \nrepresented over the last thirty years or so. From the origins of the NHS until the mid-1980s, \n\u201eadministration\u201f was the term overwhelmingly preferred for formal organizational functions, \nwithin official documents and mundane discourse (Gorsky, 2008). Administration was finally \ndisplaced from its dominance by \u201emanagement\u201f in the mid-1980s, following the publication of the \nNHS Management Inquiry, the Griffiths Report (Klein, 2006), and for the next 10-15 years those \nwith formal organizational authority (including clinicians) were almost invariably referred to as \nmanagers (Hunter, 1996). Today, administration (insofar as it features at all in contemporary \naccounts) is presented as low-status and peripheral (Parker & Dent, 1996). \nThe significance of such discursive changes was particularly evident when reviewing the \ninterviews with NHS trust chief executives conducted in the late 1990s. Reread today, the way \nthat management and leadership were deployed in these interviews seems strikingly different \nfrom contemporary practice. Administration was denigrated as it is today; however, in the late \n1990s, management (rather than leadership) was the standard term for any kind of organizing \nactivity. Although \u201eleadership\u201f was used by participants, no strong distinctions between \nmanagement and leadership were drawn. \nHowever, as far as administration was concerned, although most chief executives \ninterviewed had been administrators, being an administrator was (emphatically) not a desirable \nrole anymore. For example, when talking of the trust\u201fs top management team in place \nimmediately before her appointment, one respondent described how they had been unable to \ncope with the new demands of partnership working: \nThere [had been] no radical or strategic thinking enough to do that sort of work; [trust] \nused to be peopled by a bunch of administrators, basically. \nHere, the use of administration was performative in the sense that it amounted to more than \nsetting out a state of affairs. It was clearly derogatory. But the denigration of administrators also \nallowed the speaker to do something else with her words\u2014to construct a sense of her own role. \nShe was (emphatically) not an administrator, she was radical and strategic. \nBy the late 1990s, words associated with management and leadership seemed to have \nconstructed and legitimated an organizational world in which chief executives felt they had \nsupremacy; \u201eadministrator\u201f, on the other hand, did things that undermined the prestige and \nauthority they sought. What contrasts strikingly with today\u201fs discourses, however, is how \nmanagement tended to be the term of preference\u2014in places where leadership would likely be \nused today. This phenomenon is especially apparent in respondents\u201f talk of management in the \ncontext of clinical work. For example: \nI felt that [\u2026] the emergence of clinical governance was an opportunity to refocus the \ndoctors\u201f role on clinical management, leadership and the management increasingly of \nclinical practice informed by evidence, rather than on the management of service delivery \nand staffing budgets and so on. \nHere, the speaker deploys the term management to represent functions he considers to be \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n6 \nlegitimate medical duties: \u201cclinical management, leadership and the management increasingly of \nclinical practice informed by evidence.\u201d Leadership is mentioned, but it is not privileged, and \nseems to be a casual synonym for management rather than a distinctive entity in its own right. In \nperformative terms, one way to interpret what was being attempted by such talk at this time is to \nunderstand it as an effort to re-present conventional medical work as managerial work: the hope \nbeing, perhaps, that if managerial language became taken-for-granted in doctors\u201f routine talk and \nthinking, those doctors might come to understand their own roles as managerial, at least in part. \nIndeed, another chief executive described her frustration at many doctors\u201f refusal to recognize \nthe managerial nature of their roles: \nAll consultants are managers\u2014not all consultants would recognize that or recognize the \nimplications of that as readily as others do, but they all manage resources, they all manage \ntheir time, manage junior medical staff. \nIf medical work should come to be seen as managerial in nature, it would perhaps imply that \ndoctors should be accountable to the top manager\u2014the chief executive\u2014and furthermore that \nmore traditional considerations for the NHS\u2014especially ones based on welfarism and \ncompassion\u2014could be played down and rendered subservient to the tough job of ensuring good \nmanagement (Parker, 2000).  \nThe limits to management discourse and managerialism \nAs Grey (1999, p.572) has argued, \u201cthe insinuation of management into a huge range of human \nactivities and actors previously thought of as lying outside the specialist domain of management \n[\u2026] constitutes one of the key \u201eachievements\u201f of managerialism.\u201d However, for chief executives, \nwe see above how the term manager evidently remained vulnerable to being reconstructed by \nothers as \u201emere\u201f administration. As a performative project, then, the \u201emanagerialization\u201f of \nlanguage remained incomplete. In the wider policy context of NHS modernization from 1997, \nfurthermore, a reliance on the word \u201emanagement\u201f in government documents and ministerial \nspeeches might signal an uncomfortably close continuity with the legacy of the new Right. Both \nthese associations might discomfort many healthcare professionals, who might thus be expected \nto resist \u201emanagement\u201f becoming the unnoticed, commonsense term for significant aspects of \ntheir work (Hewison, 1997). Thus the negative associations accumulated by management and \nadministration may have assisted the popular and officially sanctioned turn to leadership that has, \nas we shall see, increasingly occurred. As Parker (2004, p.175) puts it, \u201cmanagement itself [\u2026 is] \nbeginning to go out of fashion (now being discursively articulated as something rather like \nadministration) and leadership [\u2026 is] the new panacea.\u201d \nFor those in charge of the NHS today, then, part of the attractiveness of the discourse of \nleadership may be that it does not (at least yet) have the negative connotations that management \nhas gained. \u201eManagement\u201f can be (re)constructed as being something like administration\u2014\nconcerned with money, day-to-day bureaucratic functions etc.\u2014whereas leadership can be \nconstructed in attractively heroic terms. An early populariser of this idea in health was Rosemary \nStewart, who sets up a hierarchy of terms with administration at its base and leadership at the \napex: \nGood managers are not necessarily good administrators, and a leader has a more important role to play away \nfrom the desk. \n1. Administrators confirm in writing. \n2. Managers direct. \n3. Leaders point the way: they identify and symbolise what is important. (Stewart, 1989, p.5) \nThe pluralization of leadership \nIn the previous section, we focused on the discourses of administration, management and \nleadership in the self-descriptions of NHS chief executives in the late 1990s. We highlighted both \nthe potentials of this discourse\u2014in promoting particular constructions of the place of \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n7 \nmanagement in the NHS\u2014and its limitations\u2014as a discourse that also prompts resistance. \nHowever, we are not (merely) arguing for an understanding of leadership as a form of semantic \ninflation, aggrandizing and legitimizing the role of the administrator\/manager. Rather, we \nsuggest, there has been a discursive break between management and leadership (Parker, 2004), in \nwhich leadership is no longer merely a particular style or skill of good management, but an \nincreasingly separate ontological category\u2014a category that appeals to many who would not have \ntraditionally been regarded as managers. In illustrating this, we now turn to our analysis of high-\nprofile NHS policy documents since 1997, and the developing place, meaning and function of \n\u201eleadership\u201f within these texts. \nThis notion of leadership as a quality to be distributed and dispersed among staff \nthroughout the hierarchy, \u201cfrom apex to frontline\u201d (Hartley & Allison, 2000, p.39), has informed \nhealth policy under Labour governments since 1997, with their ambition to transform public-\nservice provision through \u201emodernization\u201f (Martin et al., 2009). The NHS Plan (SoSH, 2000) \nincluded an entire section on leadership, calling for \u201cfirst class leaders at all levels of the NHS\u201d \n(p.86). Its main focus, though, was on increasing the number of formal leadership positions \noutside NHS management and the medical profession, with the introduction of modern matrons, \nnurse consultants and new senior roles in the allied health professions. Additionally, the Plan \nannounced policies designed to increase \u201eleadership capacity\u201f among senior NHS managers: \nNHS organizations should be led by the brightest and the best of public sector \nmanagement. Leadership development in the NHS has always been ad hoc and incoherent \nwith too few clinicians in leadership roles and too little opportunity for board members to \ndevelop leadership skills. That will now change. (p.87) \nOther key policy documents from the late 1990s and the early 2000s emphasised the importance \nof high-level leadership in transforming NHS provision. An entire chapter of The New NHS \n(SoSH, 1997, chapter 4) was devoted to the role of Health Authorities \u201cleading and shaping\u201d the \nnew NHS, \u201cfreed from unnecessary administrative activities so that they are properly able to lead \nthe local NHS and ensure it delivers.\u201d Similarly, it is national government and regional Health \nAuthorities which were identified as the main sources of leadership in the public health green and \nwhite papers of the late 1990s (SoSH, 1998, 1999). \nLater policy documents, however, pluralized the notion of leadership. In line with wider \nreforms of the NHS which increasingly sought to \u201cgive frontline staff greater control over how \nlocal health services are delivered\u201d in place of \u201cthe traditional top-down management approach\u201d \n(SoSH, 2002, p.34), leadership was no longer solely the province of managers and Health \nAuthorities, but something to be distributed wider. The NHS Improvement Plan (SoSH, 2004a) \nheralded more flexible roles for healthcare staff, including, for example, giving nurses \u201ca lead role \nin improving the experience of patients in both the hospital and the community.\u201d (p.60). The \nImprovement Plan also announced the \u201cnew lead roles for commissioners\u201d in the newly reinstituted \nNHS internal market, while the health and social care white paper, Our Health, Our Care, Our Say \n(SoSH, 2006) included various measures to promote \u201clocal leadership of wellbeing\u201d (p.24). \nFurthermore, this devolution of leadership from the centre towards frontline practitioners \nrelated not just to responsibility for instigating change, but for designing policy, too. Back in \n2000, preparation of The NHS Plan had included \u201cspecialist teams involving front-line staff, \nprofessional groups, patient representatives\u2014alongside senior doctors, nurses and managers\u201d \n(SoSH, 2000, p.14). By the time of the Next Stage Review (SoSH, 2008), though, this earlier \napproach to consulting staff in policy development could be dismissed as marginalization, as staff \nthemselves led the new vision:  \nIn previous reviews of the NHS, frontline staff have been on the fringes or bystanders. \nThis Review has been different. We and our colleagues in the NHS have been at its core. \nThere has been an unprecedented opportunity for health and social care professionals to \nreview the best available evidence, to discuss priorities with patients and the public, and \ndevelop compelling shared visions for our local NHS. \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n8 \nThe Review thus described itself as \u201cthe product of the work more [sic] than 2,000 clinicians and \nother staff in health and social care, who have shown tremendous leadership in creating, shaping \nand forming the conclusions\u201d (p.17). \nFrontline staff are not the only ones to be engaged in leading the policy agenda. In the \nprocess of local leadership described as giving rise to the Next Stage Review, patients too were \nclaimed to have been central. In coming to its conclusions, the 2000 clinicians mentioned above \n\u201cworked in partnership with thousands of patients, listened to the needs and aspirations of the \npublic and set out comprehensive and coherent visions for the future\u201d (p.17), to arrive at \u201clocal \nvisions [that] made the case for national action to enable local change\u201d (p.21). On an \nunprecedented scale (again, if policy discourse is to be believed), patients and the public are, like \nfrontline staff, moving from the periphery into a central, leading role in health-policy \ndevelopment. Our Health, Our Care, Our Say (SoSH, 2006) purported to include the most \nwideranging public consultation ever, placing the public \u201cmore in control of the policy setting \nprocess itself first at national and then local level\u201d (p.14). Two extensive phases of consultation \nahead of publication of the white paper, which turned out to be \u201cwholly consistent\u201d (p.15) with \none another, offered clear messages about how statutory provision on which they could rely \nneeded to be supplemented by more choices when provision failed. With professionals, patients \nand the public leading the policymaking agenda in this way, the role of policymakers themselves \nshifts to a more modest one, of converting these views into a clear plan: the white paper itself \nsought only to \u201ctranslate what people have said into a new strategic vision,\u201d \u201csupporting choice \nand giving people more say over decisions that affect their daily lives\u201d (p.17). \nIn the delivery of care, too, leadership is increasingly to reside with patients and the public \nas well as frontline staff, with improvements in services and health outcomes resting on \u201clocal \ncommunities leading for health\u201d (SoSH, 2004b, pp.76-101), and on the choices increasingly \ndelegated to individual patients (SoSH, 2006). This includes \u201cnew forms of community \nleadership\u201d that involve \u201ca new approach to unlocking the energy that lies within communities \nthemselves\u201d (SoSH, 2004b, p.82). Given this need to rely not only on the leadership of clinicians \nbut of patients too in improving the health service, \u201cwe must [\u2026] continue to empower patients \nwith greater choice, better information, and more control\u201d (SoSH, 2008, p.38). Leadership, then, \nis vested in an increasingly heterogeneous group of actors in these policy documents, with \nfrontline staff, patients and even the public themselves empowered to lead change through their \nlocalized knowledge, their skills, their decisions: their agency.  \nLeadership discourse, decentralization and central power \nThis discourse of leadership (and empowerment) aligns well with other changes in policy in the \nNHS: the adoption of \u201edecentralization\u201f as a mantra for reform (Greener et al. 2009); the efforts \nto shift the balance of power from acute hospitals to primary care-based commissioners (DoH, \n2001); the creation of foundation hospital trusts as a means of promoting community ownership \nof secondary-care provision, with representation of frontline staff and patients as members and \ngovernors (Walshe, 2003); and the increased involvement of patients and the public in \ncommissioning decision-making through Local Involvement Networks (Martin, 2009). Yet the \npluralization of leadership sits rather less comfortably with what many commentators agree has \nbeen an increasing centralization of power in the NHS since 1997 (Greener et al. 2009). Centrally \ndriven performance management; regulatory, audit and inspection agencies ranging from NICE \nto the Care Quality Commission; \u201ecomptrol\u201f through a heavily regulated and directed market for \nhealthcare provision: all these are seen by academic commentators as drawing power in to the \ncentre, and reducing the \u201edecision space\u201f\u2014and, one would presume, the ability to lead\u2014of other \nagents. \nPolicy discourse itself presents no inherent contradictions in these divergent pressures, \nconstructing instead a situation in which central authority supports, rather than directs, the \nleaders on the front line. Take, for example, this excerpt from the 2003 white paper Building on the \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n9 \nBest (the emphases are ours): \nReal change will happen at the front line, with support from the centre, fuelled by \nencouragement and expectation from patients and drawing on the experience of partner \norganisations and other experts. Change will need: \n a clear shared vision and values, owned by national and local leaders; \n supported by continued investment and capacity growth; \n delivered by empowered staff, with support from peers and experts; \n backed up by high quality information systems; \n informed by a stronger patient voice; and \n underpinned by a coherent system of incentives, regulation and inspection. \n(SoSH, 2003, p.55) \nIn the policy construction of leadership, visions and values are owned by leaders, informed by \npatients and delivered by staff. Incentives, regulation and inspection, and the information systems \nthat enable these managerial technologies to function, merely underpin and back up these \nempowered agents. Yet empirical research in the new NHS consistently shows that this is not the \nexperience of managers, clinicians and staff, who find that while accountability may have been \nmoved towards local health organizations and individual clinicians, power remains with the \ncentre\u2014a system of \u201enational paternalism with local accountability\u201f, as Greener and Powell (2008) \ncall it. \nDiscussion: the discursive appeal of leadership \nThe previous sections attempt to illustrate two related shifts in discourse around policy and \nmanagement in the NHS. Firstly, there has been a notable shift in the terminology used to \ndescribe one area of activity in the running of the health service, from \u201eadministration\u201f, through \n\u201emanagement\u201f, to \u201eleadership\u201f. Secondly, this label of \u201eleadership\u201f has been applied to the activities \n(actual or aspirational) of increasingly heterogeneous actors, including not just those in senior \nmanagement positions, but also clinicians (including \u201efrontline clinicians\u201f) in a wide variety of \nprofessions, and patients and the public themselves. Leadership is no longer something to be \nexercised by those in formal positions of authority alone, a particular style or commendable \ncharacteristic of management: it is something to be brought out in actors across and beyond the \nhealth service, and which is fundamental to the success of ambitions to raise NHS quality. \nWhat this means in practice, though, is not so clear. For a start, we should reiterate, our \nsecond dataset relates to policy, rather than evidencing changes in the practice of NHS staff. If, \nhowever, we posit that these policies are intended to achieve some substantive change in the way \nin which managers, clinicians and patients go about their business, this gives rise to the question \nof whether it is possible for leadership to be pluralized to such an extent. If everyone is, or \nshould be, a leader, then who is following? As is to be expected from high-level policy documents \nof the kinds considered above, there is little detail here about the substance of leadership, how it \nis to be exercised in practice. However, as critical leadership studies have shown, \u201eleadership\u201f is at \nbest a very broad signifier, and when subjected to closer scrutiny, often seems to connote \nnothing at all that can be empirically delimited (Alvesson & Sveningsson, 2003; Kelly, 2008). In \nthis light, the function of \u201eleadership\u201f is better understood less as a meaningful label for a \ndiscernible set of empirical practices, and more in terms of its discursive properties. As Ford \n(2006, p.83) argues, the discourse of leadership can serve to constitute individuals\u201f subjectivities, \noffering a particular way of being a professional manager: \nThis interest in effective leadership [offers] one of the prevailing discourses through which \nmanagers\u201f self-identity is constructed and maintained. These discourses of leadership in the \npublic sector, depicted within the broader modernization discourse, provide managers with \na means of self-monitoring, in which managers are \u201ecultivated\u201f to become \u201eautonomous, \nself-regulating, productive individuals\u201f. \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n10 \nThough it must compete with other discourses around what it means to be a manager, Ford finds \nthat leadership can provide a powerful \u201cvocabulary and way of behaving that constrains, \ninfluences and manipulates managers into how their very identities are constructed\u201d (p.83). \nIf, regardless of the possibility or otherwise of enacting leadership, one function of \nleadership discourse is then to attempt to engender these particular subjectivities among \nmanagers, how might it work upon the other groups of health-service actors of whom it is \ndemanded, such as frontline professionals, patients and the public? Learmonth (2005, p.631) \nargues that \nthroughout the public sector, the official endorsement of leadership to represent \norganizational practices can be interpreted, in part, as a growing recognition that calling \nactivities \u201eleadership\u201f does more than calling them \u201emanagement\u201f (and, it goes without \nsaying, more than \u201eadministration\u201f) in terms of encouraging individuals to identify with \npolicy aims. \nIn these terms, talk of leadership distributed across the NHS workforce and beyond might \nrepresent a rhetorical device that seeks to engage these groups in the reforms required, according \nto policy, to achieve certain desirable ends: modernization, increased performance, quality. \nLeadership discourse seeks, then, to create new \u201cgrids for the perception and evaluation of \nthings\u201d (Foucault, 1991; quoted in Motion & Leitch, 2009, pp.1056-1057). \nIn particular, one aim of this discourse seems to be to mitigate the tensions between the \npolicy vision of a decentralized NHS in which frontline practitioners are empowered, and the \nempirical reality of a health service in which the performance-management regime of the centre is \nas powerful as ever (perhaps more so) (Greener et al., 2009). This contradiction, between claimed \ndecentralization and actual retention of power by the centre, is not unique to governments since \n1997: for Klein (2008), all health ministers since the inception of the NHS, save for Enoch \nPowell, have done the same. The purpose served by leadership, and associated discourses around \nempowerment of patients and frontline staff, is to attempt to align the subjectivities of these \nperipheral agents with policy intentions\u2014since even if the NHS is still centrally controlled, it \nnevertheless relies on the acquiescence of those beyond the centre for the achievement of policy \naims, especially in the increasingly complex organizational context of the present-day NHS. The \ncentralization-decentralization paradox is not new, then, but in a late-modern society composed \nof fragmented, autonomous individuals and a panoply of quasi-autonomous organizations, the \nneed to draw on seductive as well as dictatorial logics of rule is all the more important for achieving \npolicy aims. \nThrough devices such as the call to leadership, then, policy and its implementation are \nmade not just everyone\u201fs responsibility, but also everyone\u201fs common aim\u2014even their sense of self. This \nprocess of co-optation is pursued with varying degrees of subtlety in government policy \ndocuments. At one extreme, the claim made in Our Health, Our Care, Our Say (SoSH, 2006), that \nthe policy of increased competition introduced in this white paper was based on a comprehensive \nprocess of consultation with the public, seems highly questionable when set against other, \ncredible sources of information about the public\u201fs views on choice and competition (e.g. Clarke \net al., 2007). Clarke et al. (2007) find a public that conceptualizes choice in much less market-\noriented terms, and one that is actually resistant to the consumerist notion of its relationship to \npublic-service provision proffered by policy. Other aspects of this co-optation into leadership are \nmore subtle. The Next Stage Review (SoSH, 2008, p.17), a product of the leadership of \u201cmore than \n2,000 clinicians and other staff in health and social care,\u201d and authored by a clinician (albeit an \nelite surgeon, life peer and then under-secretary of state for health), is perhaps more astute in the \nway it attempts to pluralize leadership. \nThis is not to say that doctors, nurses, patients and others credulously take up these policy \ndiscourses, simply because of the involvement or endorsement of high-profile clinicians, and \nunquestioningly become the subjects desired. There has long been an evident scepticism among \nmedical practitioners, for example, towards the claims of civil servants to involve any more than \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n11 \nan \u201ein-group\u201f of clinicians in policy development (e.g. Grimley Evans & Tallis, 2001). However, \nthis may not matter if policy discourse succeeds in instilling these values of leadership into a \nsufficient number of clinicians, managers and patients across the health service. Certainly, policy \ndiscourses can achieve such outcomes: our first dataset illustrated the power of discourse in the \ntalk of NHS chief executives; others have noted the power of managerial discourses to permeate \nthe subjectivities of, for example, NHS doctors (Halford & Leonard, 1999; Harrison, 2010); \nleadership discourse is widespread in the UK and elsewhere, its influence and power evident, for \nexample, in the language of the NCHL in the United States. Thus a critical mass of actors \nidentifying with leadership, and with the aims of policy, may be enough to minimize dissent. This \ncould give rise to a process of stratification, similar to that noted by Harrison (2002) in relation to \nscientific-bureaucratic medicine, whereby those clinicians comfortable with the implications of \nthe discourse of leadership are elevated to privileged positions at the expense of the bulk of their \npeers. A similar process might be identified in the way in which NHS public-participation policy \nseeks to identify, recruit and co-opt a particular stratum of the public for involvement, chosen for \n\u201cthe combination of their ordinariness\u2014their very laity\u2014and their extraordinary enthusiasm and \narmoury of reflexive skills\u201d (Martin, 2008, p.49). If a sufficient number of patients and members \nof the public come to constitute themselves in terms of a notion of \u201ecommunity leadership\u201f that \naligns their agency with policy aims (and thus contributes to the realization of these aims), the \ndiscourse will have succeeded. As Harrison (2010) argues, we should not underestimate the \ncapacity of policy to reframe the subjectivities of health professionals and others, and the \npotential advantages conferred by the role of \u201eleader\u201f, both material and symbolic, may make it a \ndifficult discourse to resist, despite its definitional imprecision and managerialist function. \nConclusion: limits to leadership discourse? \nWe have argued that within the UK NHS in the last 10-15 years, leadership has become the \ntaken-for-granted discourse through which many organizational roles are represented, at least at \npolicy level, and potentially by role-holders themselves. Today, it is not just \nadministrators\/managers who are to think of themselves as leaders, \u201eleader\u201f is be enacted by all \nhealthcare professionals. Even patients and the public, recent policy claims, can be(come) leaders. \nIn drawing attention to these changes, we have sought to use ideas drawn from critical \nleadership studies to disrupt assumptions about the nature of leadership. The health-related \nsocial-science literature has devoted little attention, critical or otherwise, to the prominence of \nleadership in healthcare policy, practice and discourse. We argue that drawing on what critical \nleadership studies have to say on the matter can enrich our understanding of the contemporary \nlandscape of healthcare provision (cf. Davies, 2003). In particular, we have argued that the \nnaturalization of leadership discourse does things that have the potential to permeate the \nsubjectivities of those involved, to the extent that it might even make those \u201eleaders\u201f construct \nthemselves as driving such change. In other words, while \u201cI am a leader\u201d may be an attractive \nself-narrative, it also represents a powerful way in which policy imperatives might \u201egovern the \nsoul\u201f (Rose, 1990). Thus, the recent popularization of leadership represents a particularly \nimportant change for clinicians. In marked contrast to their tradition of strong resistance to \nadministrative or managerial responsibilities (Kitchener, 2000), \u201eleadership\u201f may make it more \nattractive for doctors to take on particular roles in organizations, and make them more \nsympathetic to policy changes of the kind traditionally opposed by the medical profession. \nBut what of the future? Our reading of the history of changes in organizational discourses \nwithin the NHS suggests that the positive cultural valences currently ascribed to leadership may \nnot be enduring. Ford et al. (2008) argue that earlier changes in organizational language\u2014from \nadministration to management\u2014were symptomatic of the need of policymakers to rebrand what \nwere basically similar activities. It is not implausible, therefore, that the current turn to leadership \nmay have been motivated, at least in part, by a similar desire to make the old appear new. Thus \none risk for the status of leadership is the very popularity it enjoys. A major part of its rhetorical \nThis is an electronic version of an article published in Social Science & Medicine.  \u00a9 2012 Elsevier \nLimited \n12 \nappeal would seem to lie in the contrasts that appear to exist between leadership and management. \nThese contrasts would become increasingly hard to maintain if leadership discourses approached \nubiquity, and management went out of use. \nFurthermore, as Robinson and Kerr (2009, p.878) argue, there is often \u201can \u201eunrealistic \noptimism\u201f regarding the virtue of [\u2026] the leader\u201d among leadership\u201fs proponents. In contrast, \nthey argue that leadership represents \u201csymbolic violence [particularly where] there are no \ndemocratic controls or forms of participation\u201d (p.899). This remark seems especially pertinent in \nthe context of contemporary healthcare settings, where the contradictions and compromises \ninherent in providing efficient services have made exploitation, surveillance and unfair treatment \nsome of the defining features of life for many staff, particularly those near the bottom of the \nhierarchy (Carter, 2000; Finn et al., 2010; Learmonth, 2009). Although we have argued that the \ndiscourse of leadership is powerful, we would not suggest that merely rebranding certain \npractices as leadership would, in itself, transform experiences of those jobs for the better (cf. \nNewton, 1998). Rather, should there be little substantive change in the day-to-day experiences of \nthese staff, then simply re-labelling activities under the (ostensibly positive) banner of leadership \nmight be interpreted as a fig leaf to hide the more oppressive aspects of life in healthcare \nprovision. Ultimately, if the gap between everyday organizational realities and the \npronouncements of policymakers does not narrow, then for all its current popularity, leadership \nitself may become a focus for dissent and resistance. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments. \nReferences \nAlvesson, M., & Sveningsson, S.
