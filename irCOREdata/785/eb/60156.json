The   regional   differences   reflect   the\ndistribution of aquifers and  the  more  favourable  geological  and  meteorological  conditions  for\nsurface water resource development in  Northern  Ireland  and  Scotland.  Over  70%  of  the  total\npublic  supply  in  south-east  England  is  derived   from   groundwater.   Extensive   blending   of\ngroundwater and surface water further increases the extent of groundwater  use.  Industry  and  the\nagricultural community rely on groundwater in many areas and it  is  the  predominant  source  for\nprivate water supplies. The total abstraction of  groundwater  in  the  UK,  including  that  used  by\nindustry and agriculture, is some 2400 million m3\/year. About  60%  is  pumped  from  the  largest\naquifer, the Chalk. This is a soft, microporous fractured limestone with  a  well  documented  flow\nregime (Foster and Milton, 1974; Price, 1993).\nStorage of farm wastes presents a serious potential  risk  of  surface  water  pollution.  In  the  past,\nserious pollution incidents to surface waters  have  led  to  prosecutions  by  the  UK  Environment\nAgency (EA). There has not  been  the  same  concern  about  potential  pollution  to  groundwater\nperhaps in part because \u2019out of sight is out of mind\u2019 and because of  the  greater  dilution  and  less\nimmediate impact expected in chalk groundwater  systems.  Groundwater  source  catchments  are\nmore difficult to define than the surface water equivalents as they cannot  be  as  easily  delineated\nby topography. Information from the EA\u2019s groundwater protection zone database shows  that  875\nof the 2,200 sources so far defined have a total catchment area exceeding 11,000 km2. It  therefore\nseems likely that as much as 15% of the land area of England and Wales may comprise catchment\nof an important potable groundwater supply source.\nThe main types of store in use in the UK can be classified as in Table 1. The majority of structures\ngenerally only pose a risk of water pollution because of structural or operator failure.  In  the  case\nof unlined earth-banked slurry lagoons and field heaps of solid  manure,  there  is  a  potential  risk\nthat they have been built on relatively permeable sites and  that  leakage  of  pollutants  will  occur\nand cause pollution of groundwater (Gooddy et  al.,  1998).  Several  studies  have  dealt  with  the\nissue of slurry lagoons (Culley and  Phillips,  1989;  Withers  et  al.,  1998;  Gooddy  et  al.,  1998;\nKanazawa et al., 1999; Gooddy et al., 2001) but relatively few have examined solid manure stores\n(Zhu et al., 2000), this study has therefore concentrated on a field heap of turkey litter.\nThe large nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) load carried in  solid  turkey  litter  presents  a  serious\npotential  impact  to  the  groundwater  beneath.  In  addition,  faecal  matter  contains  very   large\nnumbers of non-pathogenic bacteria but may also contain  helminth  eggs,  protozoa,  bacteria  and\nviruses which are capable of causing infectious diseases. Most microbial contaminants  die  off  in\npassage  through  the  soil  however,  where  by-passing  of  the  sub-soil  occurs,  the  role  of  the\nunsaturated zone is especially important.\nThe unsaturated chalk may provide an effective zone for pathogen  removal.   Like  the  soil  zone,\nthe chalk  unsaturated  zone  exhibits  aerobic  conditions  and  provides  a  good  medium  for  the\ndegradation  of  many  organic  compounds.   However,   soil   and   vadose   zones   can   become\noverloaded.  Furthermore,  microorganisms  may  percolate  through  most  soils  and  rock  pores,\nexcept in fine-grained strata where pore diameters are small (Harvey et al, 1995).\nNevertheless the effects of fractures may be very import in allowing the transmission of  chemical\nand particulate pollution to groundwater by largely bypassing the unsaturated zone.   Bypass  flow\nvelocities in the Chalk are large compared to typical intergranular  velocities  and  can  be  seen  in\nfractures after major recharge events.  Recent discussions of this topic are provided in Price  et  al.\n(1993) and Price et al. (2000).  It  is  unclear  how  important  these  processes  are  for  long  term\ngroundwater quality beneath solid manure stores.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSite Details\nThe site is in southern England on the side of a steeply sloping valley on the Upper Chalk close  to\nthe boundary with the Middle Chalk. The water table here is estimated at a little over 20 m  below\nground level (bgl). Litter from a turkey farm, which by its nature is mainly solid and very dry,  has\nbeen stored directly on the ground  surface  in  an  area  roughly  15 m x 15 m  for  the  past  20-30\nyears. In the fall of each year the site is cleared and the litter applied to the surrounding farmland.\nSample Extraction and Analysis\nContinuous, undisturbed core samples  from  the  unsaturated  zone  of  the  Chalk  were  obtained\nduring the fall of 1999 (after the annual litter removal had just taken place) using a lightweight rig\nof the Pilcon Wayfarer type. The undisturbed samples were retrieved by driving a steel  tube,  100\nmm in diameter and 0.45 m  long,  into  the  Chalk.  This  method  has  the  advantage  over  other\ndrilling techniques in that no lubricating fluids are used. The core was retained in the  tube  within\nan inner PVC liner.  When  full,  the  steel  tube  was  brought  to  the  surface,  capped  and  taped\nsecurely  with  the  top  and  bottom  depths  recorded.  Two  fully  cored  boreholes  were   drilled\nvertically, directly on top of the area used for storage. One  was  drilled  towards  the  edge  of  the\nsource area and one towards the middle. They were drilled to depths of  15  m  bgl  and  20  m  bgl\nrespectively.\nPorewater was extracted from the Chalk core material as soon as possible after drilling.  This  was\ncarried out using the high speed centrifuge \u2019drainage\u2019 method (Edmunds and Bath, 1976). Briefly,\ncore is crushed in a polythene bag to produce fragments of roughly 5 mm diameter before  placing\ninto the buckets of a fixed angle rotor refrigerated centrifuge.  Specially  made  Delrin  liners  with\ncollection cups and pre-filters hold the rock fragments  in  the  centrifuge  rotor.  The  samples  are\ncentrifuged at 14000 rpm  (a  driving  force  of  roughly  2.0MPa)  for  35  minutes.  The  resulting\nporewater was then split into three fractions; one filtered and acidified for cations; one filtered and\nunacidified for anions; the other unfiltered and unacidified for dissolved organic carbon.\nFiltered acidified porewaters were analysed using an ARL 34000C  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma-\nOptical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) which is calibrated for the following 11 elements:  Na,\nK, Ca, Ptotal,, SO4, Mn, Fetotal, Zn, Cu, Co and Ni. All analyses are  blank  corrected  and  detection\nlimits defined as 6 times the standard deviation of the blank.\nNitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N), and  Cl  are  determined  using  standard\nAuto Analyser II colorimetric methods (Kinniburgh and Miles, 1983) on  the  filtered,  unacidified\nwater fraction. To overcome interference problems with the yellow\/brown colour of  some  of  the\nporewaters (Gooddy et al, 1995), samples  are  run  with  and  without  the  colour  reagent  for  Cl\nanalysis  and  the  difference  between  the  two  taken  as  the   actual   concentration.   NO3-N   is\ndetermined by the cadmium column reduction method since the  high  organic  carbon  content  of\nthe samples can cause suppression of the baseline when the hydrazine\/copper reduction method  is\nused. pH is measured with a glass micro electrode  and  bicarbonate  (HCO3)  determined  with  an\nautomated  Radiometer  titrator.  Specific  electrical  conductance  (SEC)   is   measured   using   a\nRadiometer  conductivity  probe  and  corrected  to  25\u00b0C.  Dissolved  organic  carbon   (DOC)   is\nmeasured on the unacidified, unfiltered sample with a Skalar CA 10 TOC analyser.\nMicrobiological Determinations\nCore material from the boreholes  was  selected  at  approximately  5  m  vertical  intervals.  These\nsamples were disaggregated (comminuted) and suspensions were prepared in  maximum  recovery\ndiluent  using  a  wrist  action  shaker  for  15 minutes.  The  suspensions  were  examined  for  the\nfollowing microorganisms:\n\u2022 Coliforms by plate count (based on BS5763 part 2 1991)\n\u2022 Faecal enterococci by plate count (based on BS5763 part 10 1993)\n\u2022 Salmonella presence\/absence by enrichment and plating (based on BS5763 part 6 1993)\n\u2022 Escherichia coli by plate count method (based on BS4285 3.8 1988)\n\u2022 Clostridia by anaerobic plate count (based on BS5763 part 1 1991)\n\u2022 Campylobacter presence\/absence by selective enrichment using Park Sanders broth and selective\nplating using Nutritive Blood Gelatine agar and Modified Charcoal  Cefoperazone  Deoxycholate\nagar.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA study by Gooddy et al. (2000) showed the dry matter content of 7 cattle slurries to vary between\n0.2-13.9% (median 2.5%), and the total N vary from 0.25-5.7 kg\/m3 (median 1.4 kg\/m3). Analysis\nof  the  turkey  litter  from  this  site  showed  a  dry  matter  content  of  62.3%   and   total   N   as\n27.1 kg\/m3 which  is  considerably  drier  than  cattle  slurries  and  also  displays  a  much  greater\nfraction of N by weight.\nBorehole 1\nPorewater concentrations for the borehole constructed through  the  centre  of  the  litter  store  are\npresented in Figure 1. It can clearly be seen that in the top part of the profile solute  concentrations\nare very high, up to 50 times a baseline Chalk groundwater  (Gooddy  et  al.,  1998)  concentration\nfor chloride (3000 mg\/L) and even higher for ammonia (500 mg\/L), potassium (10,000 mg\/L) and\ndissolved  organic  carbon  (3000 mg\/L).  However,  concentrations  decline  rapidly   and   are   at\nbaseline level by approximately 15 metres. The top 8 samples from this site were highly coloured,\nranging from a crude oil black in the top 50  cm,  through  whiskey  brown  and  ending  in  a  pale\nstraw yellow by about 5 m (Table 2). Solutes appear to decline in concentration and  then  peak  at\n3.5 metres before declining again. This may reflect  the  very  slow  movement  of  a  contaminant\nfront, a front which has moved less than 5 metres in 20 years, due  to  the  relatively  impermeable\nnature of the turkey litter to recharging  rainwater.  Recharging  rainwater  would  be  expected  to\nmigrate at a rate of roughly  1  m\/a  for  the  Chalk  unsaturated  zone  (Darling  and  Bath,  1988).\nBeneath the top 1 metre little ammonia is present in the porewater suggesting  that  conditions  are\nhighly oxidising. Nitrate concentrations also peak at around 3000 mg\/L at 3.5 metres  and  decline\nrapidly after this suggesting both limited  movement  of  a  contaminant  plume  and  maybe  rapid\nrates of denitrification.  Copper, nickel, zinc and cobalt are all found in the upper 5  metres  of  the\nprofile.  They are associated  with  the  turkey  litter  as  all  three  of  these  elements  form  strong\norgano-metallic complexes and would not be expected at these concentrations  in  uncontaminated\nporewaters.\nBorehole 2\nPorewater concentrations for the  borehole  constructed  through  the  edge  of  the  litter  store  are\npresented in Figure 2. Over the length of the profile, solute concentrations decrease by an order  of\nmagnitude to end in levels close to baseline (Table 3). The chloride profile again shows a  peak  in\nconcentration at around 3.5 metres (4000 mg\/L), although profiles for other solutes are more noisy\nsuggesting the loading of litter at this point has been considerably  more  variable  over  the  years.\nConsequently nitrate and ammonia concentrations are much lower  than  the  other  borehole  with\nmaxima of 70 mg\/L and 25 mg\/L respectively. Higher moisture contents (generally 5-10%  higher\nthan borehole 1) support the possibility that litter coverage was less dense  at  the  edges  and  may\nexplain  the  peak  in  nitrate  concentration  around  10  m.  It  is  considered  that   this   pulse   of\ncontamination could move through the unsaturated  zone  more  rapidly  in  the  areas  not  always\ncovered by a thick matting of litter.  Concentrations of copper, nickel, zinc  and  cobalt  are  lower\nthan in borehole 1 which reflects the generally lower organic loading at this part of the store.\nMicrobiology\nMicrobiological data have been tabulated in Table 4. With  the  exception  of  the  top  0.5  metres,\nwhere low levels of clostridia were isolated, none of the test microorganisms were detected. These\ndata support the chemical analysis by indicating very  slow  movement  of  the  contaminant  front\nand suggest the chalk  matrix  is  acting  as  an  efficient  filter,  greatly  restricting  the  downward\nmigration of microbial contaminants.\nGeochemical Processes\nFrom the porewaters extracted from borehole 1  an  inverse  relationship  exists  between  oxidised\nand reduced nitrogen species (nitrate and  ammonia)  corresponding  with  the  crossover  between\naerobic and anaerobic conditions (Figure 1).  The presence of iron and manganese in the top metre\nsupports this observation.  For borehole 2 this cross-over is  less  clear  with  the  two  species  co-\nexisting (Figure 2) which suggests considerably greater availability of oxygen consistent  with  the\nmuch thinner litter cover on the edge of the manure store.  Ammonia is usually oxidised to  nitrate\nin an aerobic environment by chemoautotrophic bacteria for an energy  yield  and  carbon  dioxide\nderived carbon source, as shown in reaction 2. This reaction also generates protons  which  require\nbuffering.\nNH4+  +  2O2  (  NO3-  +  2H+  +  H2O                                                                        (1)\nThese protons can lead to the dissolution of Ca2+ from the  calcite  chalk  matrix,  producing   high\nconcentrations of Ca2+ in solution (2).\nCaCO3 + 2H+ ( 2HCO3- +  Ca2+                                                                                  (2)\nThe top few metres of borehole 1 indicate that nitrate, in the absence of  oxygen,  is  acting  as  the\nterminal electron acceptor for organic carbon degradation (3) as all the available oxygen has  been\nconsumed in the initial formation of nitrate.\n5CH2O  +  4NO3-  (  2N2  +  4HCO3-  +  CO2  + 3H2O                                              (3)\nIn the case of borehole 1, the upper 2 to 3 metres is anaerobic,  while  for  borehole  2  the  aerobic\nzone extends throughout the profile. The  extent  of  the  aerobic  zone  is  significant  in  terms  of\norganic degradation, which occurs most efficiently by aerobic respiration (4).\nCH2O  +  O2   (  CO2   +  H2O                                                                         (4)\nIn a closed system this reaction forms bicarbonate  and  a  proton  and  so  also  requires  buffering\nleading to more dissolution of the calcite matrix.  However, it is apparent that in the  aerobic  zone\nbelow 5 metres, the system is open allowing for the exchange of  CO2  with  the  atmosphere,  and\ncalcium concentrations decline to values comparable with pristine chalk porewaters.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nCore from both boreholes drilled beneath the turkey litter store showed elevated concentrations  of\norganic carbon, nitrate and ammonia in just  the  top  few  metres  of  the  porewater  profile,  with\nammonia only present in the top 2 metres below which it is oxidised. Most of  the  organic  carbon\nhas  been  oxidised  below  the  top  5  metres.  There  appears  to  be  limited   movement   of   the\ncontaminants and this is most likely due to the substantially reduced recharge that  occurs  beneath\na  dry  matting  of  turkey  litter.  Movement  has  occurred  where  the  covering  of  litter  is   less\nconsistent or possibly during the few weeks in the year after the litter has been  cleared.  However,\nit is felt that the risk of solid heaps to groundwater is minimal due to  the  relative  impermeability\nand high dry matter content of the manure. No faecal microorganisms were observed  beneath  the\nturkey litter and no preferential routes for contaminant transport  were  observed.  Both  boreholes\nsuggest that the majority of contamination has moved no further  than  5  m  over  a  period  of  20\nyears and at this rate of transport it would  take  more  than  100  years  for  the  leachate  to  reach\ngroundwater.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work has been undertaken with funding from the UK Ministry of  Agriculture,  Fisheries  and\nFood (MAFF).
