A strong case has recently been made by academics and\npolicymakers to develop national programmes for the integrated control of\nAfrica\u2019s \u2018neglected tropical diseases\u2019. Uganda was the first country to develop\na programme for the integrated control of two of these diseases: schisto-\nsomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths. This paper discusses social responses\nto the programme in Panyimur, north-west Uganda. It shows that adults are\nincreasingly rejecting free treatment. Resistance is attributed to a subjective\nfear of side-effects; divergence between biomedical and local understandings\nof schistosomiasis\/bilharzia; as well as inappropriate and inadequate health\neducation. In addition, the current procedures for distributing drugs at a\ndistrict level are problematic. Additional research was carried out in\nneighbouring areas to explore the generalizability of findings. Comparable\nproblems have arisen. It is concluded that the national programme will not\nfulfil its stated objectives of establishing a local demand for mass treatment\nunless it can establish more effective delivery strategies and promote\nbehavioural change in socially appropriate ways. To do so will require new\napproaches to social, economic and political aspects of distribution. There are\nreasons why populations infected with the \u2018neglected tropical diseases\u2019 are\nthemselves neglected. Those reasons cannot just be wished away.\nIntroduction\n\u2018Controlling Africa\u2019s neglected diseases is one of the most convincing ways to make poverty\nhistory,\u2019 (Molyneux et al., 2005, p. 106).\nOver the last few years, a compelling case has been made to develop national\ncontrol programmes for the integrated control of Africa\u2019s neglected parasitic diseases,\nincluding schistosomiasis (otherwise known as bilharzia) and soil-transmitted\nhelminths (World Health Organization, 2002; Editorial of the Lancet, 2004; Hotez,\n161\n2005; Molyneux et al., 2005, Fenwick, 2006). The strength of the case rests upon the\nfollowing points: first, there are a number of drugs with a proven track record of\nsuccess which can be cheaply manufactured and easily administered to affected\npopulations; second, it is more economical to administer these drugs as one\nintegrated, top-down, biomedical intervention rather than through multiple vertical\nstructures running side-by-side; and third, it is likely that significant reductions in\noverall child and adult mortality and morbidity can be achieved if relatively small\nproportions of public health finance directed towards the control of HIV\/AIDS, TB\nand malaria are re-directed towards the integrated control of some of the neglected,\nparasitic diseases. These arguments are particularly potent in the light of data\nrevealing that sub-Saharan Africa has fallen behind other regions in public health and\npoverty indicators; and a new political will (manifested by the Millennium Develop-\nment Goals and the Marshall Plan for Africa) to \u2018make poverty history\u2019. The Bill and\nMelinda Gates Foundation, persuaded by the merits of the above arguments, recently\ndonated US$30 million to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), Imperial\nCollege, to oversee the integrated control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted\nhelminths in six African countries: Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Niger, Burkina Faso\nand Mali.\nUganda was the first of these countries to design a five-year national control\nprogramme to control schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths. The programme\nbegan in 2003. In accordance with the World Health Assembly\u2019s Global Target, it is\nattempting to treat 75% of school-aged children and adults in regular contact with\ncontaminated water with praziquantel and albendazole. These are the drugs of choice\nfor schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths respectively and they are being\ndistributed, free of charge, on an annual basis over five years. In so doing, it is\nanticipated that adults and children will become so aware of the benefits of treatment\nto their overall health and well-being, that families will be willing to pay for treatment\nin clinics when the programme comes to an end.\nRecent publications suggest that the programme has successfully treated children\nattending school in the majority of districts within Uganda (Kabatereine et al., 2006,\n2007). However, these publications also report that adult uptake of the drugs is more\nmixed, and that it varies between districts. For instance, 91% and 84\u00b75% of adults are\nreported to have taken praziquantel and albendazole in 2003\/4 (the first year of the\nproject) in Wakiso and Bugiri districts whereas 66\u00b78% and 48\u00b78% of adults took\npraziquantel and albendazole in Nebbi and Arua districts respectively. This variation\nis crucial to understand because adults are much more able to exercise choice (and\nreject treatment if they so choose) than children treated by their teachers on school\npremises. Even if children come to appreciate benefits from treatment, the success of\nthe national control programme depends upon generating a demand for the drugs\namong adults.\nThe research presented in this paper documents social responses to the national\ncontrol programme in Panyimur, Nebbi district, north-west Uganda. Schistosoma\nmansoni (one of the three main types of schistosomiasis) has been endemic in this part\nof Uganda for a long time (Nelson, 1958; Ongom & Bradley, 1972; Ongom et al.,\n1972; Kabatereine et al., 1992), and the reported uptake of drugs among adults in the\nfirst year of the project was promising (66\u00b78%). However, the uptake of drugs declined\n162 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nin 2005. The paper, therefore, addresses the following questions: Why are adults who,\nby any criteria, are poor and eking out a living in a hot, under-resourced and remote\npart of Uganda, choosing not to swallow drugs that will rid them of infections that\ncause significant morbidity and mortality? How can these problems be rectified in the\ncontext of promoting integrated control?\nThe paper is divided into three parts to address these questions. Part one describes\nthe research site, and emphasizes the economic and political context in which the\nnational control programme is being delivered. The second part of the paper presents\nthe results, including data showing a decline in the uptake of praziquantel and\nalbendazole in 2005, compared with 2004. It also discuss waning enthusiasm for the\nprogramme and highlights three key issues: fear of treatment; a divergence between\nbiomedical and local understandings of schistosomiasis\/bilharzia; and attitudes to\nconveying health advice and the provision of treatment. The third part of the paper\ndiscusses the wider implications of the research in Panyimur in the light of research\nundertaken in Pandara village, Nebbi district and Wanseko, Masindi district. It is\nargued that integrated control in north-west Uganda will not be successful without\nsignificant policy adjustments. These include the vigorous promotion of \u2018biomedical\nevangelism\u2019 (whereby biomedical facts about schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted\nhelminths and the rationale for repeated treatment are disseminated in ways that\nconvince affected populations); and an endeavour to distribute drugs and promote\nbehavioural change in socially appropriate ways.\nPanyimur, north-west Uganda: the research site\nPanyimur sub-county, Nebbi district, is located in north-west Uganda. For admin-\nistrative purposes, Panyimur sub-county is divided into three parishes: Ganda, Boro\nand Nyagakei. A census undertaken by the local council in 2004 indicated that the\npopulation for these parishes was 5448, 5834 and 9427 respectively. The majority of\nthe population residing in Panyimur sub-county are Alur; and most of them live on\nthe north-west shores of Lake Albert. They speak a Lwo language that is very similar\nto that of the Acholi and Langi to the east, but have longstanding social connections\nwith other groups, notably Lendu, Lugbara and Madi, who have migrated into the\narea and were in the past integrated into small chiefdoms, recognizing the authority\nof ritually important chiefs known as rwodi. There is also a long history of migration\nto and from the region to the south of the lake, and in pre-colonial times, the Alur\nrwodi had important links with the Bantu-speaking Kingdom of Bunyoro.\nToday, political and economic insecurity characterize daily life. The killing of Alur\nby Lendu just across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and attacks\nby the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army close to the town of Pakwach (located a few miles to\nthe north-east), are the stuff of daily conversation. So is the precarious nature of\nlivelihoods. Dwindling fish reserves in Lake Albert and severe de-forestation are\nparticular concerns. Moreover, the dearth of rain in recent years, as well as the\ndecline in the world price of cotton, has severely restricted the cultivation and\npotential financial returns from farming. As in the past, labour migration to more\naffluent regions is an important strategy for young men and some educated women,\nbut such opportunities have become increasingly limited, especially for the unskilled.\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 163\nThus, responses to the question \u2018how is life?\u2019 typically include \u2018life is hard\u2019 (qwotek);\n\u2018there is poverty\u2019 (can otie); \u2018there is no rain\u2019 (kothope); \u2018there is no food\u2019 (cam ope);\n\u2018there is no money\u2019 (cent ope); and \u2018there is sickness\u2019 (remo otie). In many ways, they\nhelp to capture the difficulties of eking out a living in Panyimur.\nSickness, and the fear of sickness, are constant concerns. People live with an acute\nawareness of their vulnerability to dangerous ailments, including both biomedically\nrecognized diseases and numerous locally understood afflictions. They can strike at\nany time; and the difficulties of finding and securing appropriate treatments are ever\npresent. The cost of purchasing medicines from clinics and\/or travelling medicine men\ncan be prohibitive; so can visits to an ajoga or other local therapists. The government\nhealth facilities are supposed to provide free services, but the static clinics have very\nerratic supplies of drugs, and the difficulties of reaching either of the local hospitals\nin Angal and Pakwach are considerable, because public transport is minimal and\nexpensive.\nInadequate facilities are widely viewed by people in Panyimur as symptoms of\ntheir marginality. Informants are quick to convey a sense of having been left out of\ndevelopment processes; and they often comment on the fact that they feel excluded,\nboth in national terms and within their own district. With respect to the former, the\nsub-county is part of the region of Uganda referred to as \u2018West Nile\u2019, and associated\nwith the discredited regime of Idi Amin. Since Presendent Museveni came to power\nin 1986, the southern part of Uganda has benefited from relatively robust economic\ngrowth and some improvements in living standards. The people of Panyimur are\nconscious of not sharing in these changes. They often complain that this has been a\ndeliberate strategy, a kind of punishment for Amin\u2019s regime (from which they say\nthey have not even benefited), and for the regimes of Milton Obote and Tito Okello,\nwhich were associated with linguistically related Langi and Acholi to the east (for\nrecent detailed discussion of these issues, see Leopold, 2005, and Allen, 2006a). Like\nother northerners, it has made them distrustful of southerners who visit the\nsub-county and tell them how to behave.\nWith respect to the district, Panyimur is different to other areas. A way of life\nlinked to fishing, fish processing and fish marketing sets the population apart. District\nofficials in Nebbi town often talk about lake dwellers and those living near the Nile\nas \u2018difficult\u2019, \u2018stubborn\u2019 and \u2018un-cooperative\u2019. Among people in Panyimur, aid\nagencies are commonly mentioned as the only means of securing resources for social\nprojects, but most of those that have worked in the sub-county have left. Some\ninformants are even envious of populations inhabiting the war zone to the east, where\nthey imagine hundreds of non-governmental organizations are running basic services\nand giving away material items such as food, soap and grain.\nMethods\nFieldwork took place in February 2005, and for a period of three and a half\nmonths between May 2005 and August 2005. The research team was made up of three\nanthropologists, one with a long-standing interest in social and behavioural aspects of\nschistosomiasis (Parker, 1992, 1993, 1995), one with regional expertise dating back to\nthe 1980s (Allen, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1997, 2006a, 2006b), and one with medical\n164 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\ntraining (Hastings, 2005). The team worked closely with staff from SCI, Imperial\nCollege; the Ministry of Health, Kampala, and the vector control officer for Nebbi\ndistrict. Four locally trained researchers assisted with both the translation of\ninterviews and data collection.\nFieldwork involved participant observation in a wide range of settings in\nPanyimur sub-county. This included a total of 300 open-ended, unstructured\ninterviews. The research involved visits to homesteads, talking to fishermen at landing\nsites on the shores of Lake Albert, \u2018hanging out\u2019 in one of the lodges in Panyimur\ntown, and talking to people as they passed through the markets etc. Those\ninterviewed also included twenty local healing specialists (known as ajogas), nine\nvillage elders, fifteen health care providers (such as the vector control officer for Nebbi\ndistrict, clinical officers and health workers at health centres throughout Panyimur\nsub-county), ten school teachers and twelve political figureheads (such as local council\nchairmen that had been elected at the village (LC1), parish (LC2) and sub-county\nlevel (LC3)).\nIn the last five weeks of fieldwork, the team explored the generalizabilty of\nfindings, both within Panymur and in neighbouring areas. With respect to the former,\ninterviews were undertaken with adult men and women in Ganda parish at their\nhomes. The choice of homes visited was based on the Ministry of Health registers\ndocumenting the uptake of praziquantel and albendazole in 2004 and\/or 2005. Every\ntenth \u2018household\u2019 listed in the registers was selected (although in many cases the\n\u2018household\u2019 in the registers turned out to represent adults living in more than one\nhome). With respect to comparison with neighbouring areas, additional fieldwork was\nundertaken in Pandara village, Panyango sub-county, Nebbi district, where the\npopulation is also mostly Alur, and Wanseko, a town located directly across Lake\nAlbert from Panyimur in Buliisa sub-county, Masindi district, where there is a mixed\npopulation of migrants and longer-term residents (and the local languages spoken\ninclude Lunyoro and Lougungu as well as Lwo).\nIn Pandara, the availability of Ministry of Health registers enabled the team to\nrepeat the selection exercise in Ganda Parish. One in ten registered \u2018households\u2019 were\nvisited, and 20 semi-structured interviews were carried out. In Wansenko, Ministry of\nHeath registers were mostly missing, so similar random selection of \u2018households\u2019 was\nnot possible. Fifty semi-structured interviews were carried out with adult men and\nwomen, based on visits to every third home; and two group meetings were arranged\nby two of the three LC1 chairmen. These were attended by 27 and 31 adults\nrespectively. In addition, four of the six drug distributors resident in the area were\ninterviewed, as well as four biomedical practitioners based at Buliisa, the nearest\nhealth centre.\nInterviews in Panyimur and Pandara were usually conducted in the Alur language,\nbut a few took place in English or Swahili. In Wanseko, interviews were undertaken\nin the local languages (which included languages spoken by the Alur, the Bunyoro\nand the Bungungu). Most open-ended interviews were tape-recorded and subsequently\ntranscribed into English. Wherever possible, interviews were undertaken in a relaxed\nand open manner; and a great deal of emphasis was given to establishing trust and\nrapport with informants. While an endeavour was made to discuss similar themes\nwith each interviewee (such as their experiences of treatment in 2004 and 2005), it was\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 165\nalso the case that efforts were made to elicit information about other aspects of\nmisfortune and healing, and daily life more generally. Typically, adults were visited\nin their homesteads, and once the rationale for the research had been explained, the\ninterview began. More often than not, a small crowd gathered round each informant\nand many of these people contributed to the interview too. Indeed, their views were\nactively solicited. So, in many ways, the majority of interviews were akin to\nimpromptu focus group discussions rather than one-to-one interviews. They capture\nthe dominant subjective concerns that are widely expressed and debated by people\nliving in this part of Uganda.\nAdult uptake of drugs in Panyimur\nThere are 49 villages in the three parishes that make up Panyimur sub-county.\nPraziquantel and albendazole were distributed, free of charge, to adults and children\nliving in all 49 villages in 2004 and 2005. To facilitate distribution, every village was\nprovided with one or more registers with a view to documenting the name, age and\nheight of adults and children on a household-by-household basis. The number of\npraziquantel and albendazole tablets taken by each individual in 2004 and 2005 was\nalso recorded. Analysis of the available data from the local Ministry of Health\nregisters showed that a total of 6511 adults were given praziquantel and albendazole\nin 2004, and 2037 of these were re-treated in 2005. To put it another way, 4474 adults\n(68\u00b77%) were not re-treated in 2005.\nIt is important to note the limitations of these data. First, these figures are based\non incomplete data as there were registers available for all twelve villages in Ganda\nparish and fourteen of the eighteen villages in Boro parish, but only five of the\nnineteen villages in Nyakagei parish. The others had \u2018gone missing\u2019. Second, the\nsystem of distribution throughout the sub-county differed between 2004 and 2005, and\nin neither year followed the guidelines provided by SCI, which intended the drugs to\nbe swallowed in front of locally elected drug distributors. In 2004, local politicians\nwere asked to oversee the distribution of drugs and this involved LC1 chairmen\ndistributing drugs on a household-by-household basis. There is no way of knowing,\nhowever, whether everyone allocated drugs in 2004 swallowed them, and it is likely\nthat the figures for 2004 convey a misleadingly high response rate (as several\ninformants told us that some people stored their drugs for a day when they felt really\nsick, and others sold them or gave them to relatives when they fell sick). By contrast,\nthe therapy was directly observed in 2005. Adults were asked to take praziquantel\nunder the gaze of health workers and their helpers at health centres throughout the\nsub-county. However, observations at one of the distribution sites revealed that some\npeople were being allowed to take the drug away and take it in their own time\n(namely, teachers, religious leaders, business people, government officials, relatives\nand some of the friends of the health workers). There is, of course, no way of\nknowing how many people were allowed to do this and whether or not the people\nconcerned saved the tablets, sold them or swallowed them as intended. In spite of\nthese limitations, the available data suggest that the majority of people in Panyimur\nwere not re-treated in 2005. The next section sheds light on waning enthusiasm for\nthe national control programme in 2005.\n166 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nFear of treatment\nFirst, there was widespread concern about the side-effects associated with swallowing\nthe tablets. Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the issue was raised\nat virtually every interview undertaken. Not everyone experienced side-effects, but\nalmost all informants had experiences within their immediate or extended families of\nindividuals who had taken the drugs and subsequently experienced illness for several\ndays, and in some cases, several weeks. Concerns about the severity of the side-effects\nexperienced in 2004 undoubtedly generated fear and antipathy towards swallowing the\ndrugs in 2005. The following quotes illustrate their fears:\nWe fear the drug . it is strong and powerful . and it is not wise to take it unless you have\nfood stored in the house. This drug can knock you out for more than a week at a time.\nWhen I took the tablet, \u2018praziquantel\u2019, [in 2004] it disturbed me for 2 to 3 weeks . I am a\nfisherman [and] I cannot afford not to fish. That is why I did not take it [in 2005].\nIt should be noted that informants such as those quoted above rarely mentioned\nalbendazole by name, but in rejecting praziquantel they were effectively rejecting\nalbendazole, as this was given out at the same time. For this reason, references made\nto praziquantel are placed in inverted commas. In addition, it should be observed that\ninformants were familiar with the term \u2018bilharzia\u2019, but their understandings rarely\ncoincided with biomedical conceptions of schistosomiasis. Local references to\n\u2018bilharzia\u2019 are therefore placed in italics.\nSeveral people expressed their concern about the strength and power of \u2018prazi-\nquantel\u2019 by refusing to take it if they felt unwell on the day of distribution. Thus, a\nfisherman spoke about his wife in the following way: \u2018she was sick and weak, and\ndidn\u2019t have the strength to take it\u2019. Others felt that if they were harbouring other\ninfections then it was inadvisable to take \u2018praziquantel\u2019. For instance, a woman,\nchatting on her way back from collecting water at the pump, said: \u2018people say \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t\ntake that drug, if you are HIV positive.\u2019\u2019 Is that true?\u2019 She decided not to take the\ndrug in June 2005 as she thought she might be infected with HIV and her body was\ntoo weak to cope with \u2018praziquantel\u2019.\nFear of the side-effects associated with \u2018praziquantel\u2019 was also acute among those\nliving far from the distribution point and those unable to take the drug on a full\nstomach. Ironically enough, some informants felt that they were too poor to risk\ntaking the drug. To quote:\nI live far from the distribution site and they were telling people to take there. I feared the\nside-effects so I didn\u2019t take it.\nYou suffer from severe diarrhoea for so many days . you are out of work and don\u2019t have\nenough to eat so you can\u2019t survive.\nInformants also expressed concern and fear that treatment with \u2018praziquantel\u2019\nleads to infertility and miscarriage. For instance, married men in Ganda parish\nexpressed concern that their wives had not conceived since the 2004 mass treatment\ncampaign; and a group of fisherman from a different part of the parish said:\nWe heard it can make us barren . impotent . these drugs can make our wives abort the fetus\n. many believe this.\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 167\nIn a similar vein, a political representative for another sub-county within Nebbi\ndistrict said: \u2018pregnant women are fearing if they take the drug, it will lead to\nmiscarriage\u2019; and a secretary to a local politician gave voice to a more invidious\nconcern when he stated that:\nThe treatment for bilharzia can cause a woman to abort so women, particularly, are afraid to take\n\u2018praziquantel\u2019 . women want to give birth frequently, and they think the Ministry [of Health]\nwants to reduce the birth rate [in this part of the country].\nThe idea that the Ugandan government is using public health interventions to\nweaken populations in the north is much discussed in Panyimur, and concern is not\nrestricted to the national control programme for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted\nhelminths. At the time of this fieldwork, for example, there was some discussion as\nto whether the USA government was colluding with the Ugandan government to\nreduce the birth rate in this part of Africa.\nA further theme emerging from fieldwork undertaken in Panyimur concerns a fear\nof over-dosing. Local politicians and other villagers, in particular, expressed a concern\nthat incorrect quantities of drugs were being administered as a consequence of\nallocating drugs according to height, rather than weight. As one person put it: \u2018You\ncan be thin and tall and given too much; or short and fat and given too little.\u2019\nSimilarly, an elderly man said: \u2018Why do they measure height? [After all] you can be\nyoung and tall (and take too many tablets) or old and short and take too few tablets.\u2019\nHe went on to describe how he knew a woman who lived close to the lake whose son\nwas taller than her and took more tablets than her. This was \u2018very discouraging\u2019 for\nthe woman concerned.\nConcerns over the dosage links to a widespread fear of side-effects associated with\ntreatment for bilharzia, as well as fears that the drug, \u2018praziquantel\u2019, can actually kill.\nA fisherman, in the presence of a group of eight others, said:\nThere was confusion in the measurement of height. A young child of seven years was measured\nand given 6 tablets, so there were complications. The child who took 6 tablets died.\nThis reference to death was one of 25 accounts of adults and children that\nallegedly died soon after swallowing \u2018praziquantel\u2019 in 2004. Other accounts that\nemerged spontaneously in the course of interviews with adults in Ganda parish\ninclude the following:\nPeople died from taking the drug [in 2004] . they were not sick before . we know of three\npeople that died.\nIt is a very powerful drug . if you take it on an empty stomach, it can make you very sick .\nit can even kill you.\nA fisherman, in the presence of about 30 fishermen, also said:\nWe know of six people who died [from \u2018praziquantel\u2019 in 2004] . they were overdosed because\nof lack of measurements and they were anaemic.\nThere was much nodding in agreement as he spoke. And a clinical officer at a\nhealth centre gave voice to local peoples\u2019 concerns that there may be ulterior motives\nbehind the programme when he said:\n168 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nPeople fear the drug . there are rumours that the government is killing people with this drug\nprogramme. Someone died after treatment [2004] ... they were sick before treatment but [he] died\nso people think the drug can kill. They are suspicious.\nComments on reported fears\nNone of the side-effects reported above (including fears of infertility, miscarriage\nand death) has been verified by clinicians, as the necessary resources are not currently\navailable. However, Kabatereine (2000) and Kabatereine et al. (2006) have drawn\nattention to side-effects arising from treatment for S. mansoni in neighbouring\nMasindi district, including diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Kabatereine et al. also refer\nto an \u2018independent evaluation\u2019 of the national control programme, which noted local\nconcerns about mortality arising from treatment (Kabatereine et al., 2006, p. 213).\nHowever, Kabatereine et al. (2006) go on to say that mortality arising from treatment\nis not \u2018credible\u2019, given the research that shows that praziquantel and albendazole are\nsafe and efficacious.\nThere is indeed strong clinical evidence indicating that this is the case (see, for\nexample, Bergquist, 2002), and much higher doses of praziquantel than are used in\nschistosomiasis treatment are routinely recommended for treatment of cysticercosis.\nEven if it was the case that a seven-year-old child was given six tablets (as alleged in\nthe quote above), significant adverse reactions would not be expected (personal\ncommunication with Narcis Kabatereine, October 2006).\nNevertheless, the persistent reporting of severe side-effects in Panymur, including\ninstances of mortality, need to be taken seriously. It is possible that relatively intense,\nshort-term side-effects have been underestimated, particularly among people that are\nimmuno-compromised, under-nourished and\/or suffering from other parasitic infec-\ntions. Moreover, in this particular context, it is just as important to understand\nand overcome local misconceptions about treatment, as there is no doubt that\n\u2018praziquantel\u2019 is perceived to be an aggressive and powerful drug. Indeed, the political\nrepresentative for the sub-county revealed that he, too, had been \u2018scared\u2019 to take the\ndrugs as he feared their strength. The next section discusses local understandings of\nbilharzia and shows that it is not going to be possible to overcome these fears without\nengaging with local perspectives.\nLocal understandings of bilharzia\nLocal understandings of the biomedical symptoms associated with S. mansoni may be\ndivided into two broad areas. First, the symptoms may be interpreted as a sign of\nwitchcraft or a locally understood ailment rather than manifestations of a parasitic\ninfection. These explanations may exclude other explanations or exist alongside them.\nSecond, symptoms may be associated with okudi, a general word for worms or, more\nspecifically, okudi bilharzia. However, local understandings of the aetiology of okudi\nbilharzia do not necessarily match biomedical understandings of the aetiology of\nS. mansoni. In fact, local informants, including those associated with formal health\ncare services, were rarely able to explain or describe the life-cycle and symptoms\nassociated with infection by S. mansoni. The two areas are discussed in turn:\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 169\nSymptoms of S. mansoni and locally understood ailments\nThe most commonly cited local ailment believed to cause symptoms similar to\nthose associated with patients heavily infected with S. mansoni is awola. Symptoms\nof awola include a swollen stomach, diarrhoea and overall body ache. Awola may\nalso result in the afflicted person vomiting blood, a symptom that a biomedical\npractitioner associates with ascites \u2013 a serious and sometimes fatal complication\narising from infection with S. mansoni. However, awola is not caused by an invading\npathogen. It is an illness that is inflicted on an individual by a witch due to envy. The\nintention is to make someone so ill that they might die. It is sometimes referred to\nas a jok illness (as jok is a term used to describe certain kinds of spirits or spiritual\nforce). If awola is suspected, it is often said that the only curative practice that is\neffective is treatment by a kind of witch doctor known as an ajoga. There is, however,\nsome debate locally about this, in part because an ajoga is likely to be possessed by\nspirits. Some Christians view such possession as \u2018satanic\u2019. There are, therefore, certain\nawola treatment specialists who deny being witchdoctors and, in certain respects,\nmimic biomedical practitioners (although their remedies are derived from local herbs\nand roots, the efficacy of which is sometimes said to be revealed in dreams). Whatever\nthe case, treatment of awola involves several visits to an awola specialist who \u2018sucks\u2019\nout a sticky substance from the person\u2019s \u2018stomach\u2019 (i.e. magically removes it from the\nabdomen). The presence of this substance confirms the illness as awola. If an ajoga\nis consulted, therapy will also involve s\u00e9ances to placate certain spirits.\nTreatment of people affected by awola is widespread in Panyimur sub-county. It\nis also commonly believed that treatment of awola with biomedical drugs from the\nhealth centre is dangerous. The health of the afflicted person will deteriorate and they\nmay even die. It is, however, acceptable to go to the health centre after awola has\nbeen diagnosed and treated, because drugs such as paracetemol and septrin are\nthought to assist with the side-effects. The following extract from an interview with\na young mother illustrates the above points:\nMother: If you have awola and you go for injection it can kill you. It is a witch disease (jajok).\nIt can come on any living person, children and adults. You have stomach ache, vomit, diarrhoea\n. If you are given any medication you just die.\nQuestion: How do you know it\u2019s awola?\nMother: You will get to know when you take the medicine and the condition worsens, then you\nwill know. Adults may not die, but children do.\nQuestion: How do you treat awola?\nMother: You don\u2019t get medicine . The one who heals, sucks it out.\nSuch beliefs have clear implications for the national control programme. They are\nunderlined in the following quote:\nAwola is a problem . people think when they are troubled by \u2018worms\u2019 that it\u2019s awola so they\ndon\u2019t go for mass treatment drugs.\nBilharzia\nWhile concerns about awola are prevalent in Panyimur, so is awareness of\nbilharzia. Bilharzia is likely to be an alternative interpretation of symptoms of awola,\n170 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nrather than an interpretation that is held simultaneously. It is understood as a type\nof okudi. Other types of okudi include okudi ascaris, okudi hookworm, okudi amoeba\nas well as okudi bilharzia. Okudi bilharzia is often said to be the kind of worm most\nlikely to cause ill health. Indeed, one informant referred to it as \u2018the chairman of\nworms\u2019. This probably reflects earlier efforts at schistosomiasis control in the area,\nsuch as those of an Italian NGO that provided de-worming treatment for three\nyears, immediately before the instigation of the national control programme.\nHowever, local use of the term \u2018bilharzia\u2019 does not mean that biomedical\nunderstandings of the aetiology of S. mansoni are widespread. On the contrary, there\nare diverse views about how bilharzia is transmitted. There is also ambiguity about\nthe distinctions between different types of worms. In short, beliefs about bilharzia\noverlap with biomedical understandings of S. mansoni, but they do not replicate\nthem.\nBy way of illustration, a clinical officer in Nebbi district said \u2018[bilharzia] is caused\nby drinking and bathing in contaminated water\u2019; a senior politician that \u2018our people\nhere do not understand that you can get it by treading on faeces\u2019; a local politician\n(LC1 chairman) that \u2018bilharzia is a big concern here as people are drinking dirty water\nfrom a contaminated source\u2019; and a Catholic priest advised a man that was vomiting\nblood and passing blood in his stool (two clinical signs of infection with S. mansoni)\nto see an ajoga as he had been \u2018poisoned\u2019 (i.e. affected by witchcraft). When one old\nman was shown a picture depicting the life cycle of S. mansoni, he asked how it was\npossible for tiny worms to enter the pores in his feet and then become so big in his\nbody that they would make noises when he ate. Along similar lines, children in\nprimary schools described okudi bilharzia as being \u2018like earthworms\u2019; and people living\nnear a borehole located too close to a swampy area at the edge of the Nile would not\ndrink from it, because they sometimes found big black okudi bilharzia in the pumped\nwater, and were concerned about infection.\nWith respect to the symptoms associated with bilharzia or okudi bilharzia, the\nfollowing symptoms are widely associated with this infection: diarrhoea, bloody\ndiarrhoea, swollen stomach, and vomiting blood (ngok rimo). The situation is further\ncomplicated by the fact that these signs and symptoms are simultaneously understood\nwithin a discourse about eating and the shortage of food. Worms have to be fed. They\nlive in the stomach and eat food. They cause hunger, stomach ache, anaemia and\nfatigue. When they become hungry, they are said to growl in the stomach. An elderly\nfisherman said:\n. the worms in the body make a sound in the tummy . drrrr\u2019; and a 52-year-old woman, too\nsick to work in her garden, stated: \u2018I am disturbed by worms . they are always there, they give\nme stomach pain and bring hunger. I can hear them in the morning . at times there is weakness\nand also general body pain.\nThe widespread comment \u2018we are disturbed by worms\u2019 may sometimes refer to\ninfection with okudi bilharzia; but there are other times when it refers to hunger. Food\ninsecurity is a major aspect of life in Panyimur and disturbance with worms gives\nvoice to the struggle to survive.\nWith reference to this last point, it should be recognized that the vast majority of\npeople living in Panyimur view okudi and okudi bilharzia, in particular, as an\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 171\nundesirable yet inevitable part of life. They are acutely aware that their livelihoods\ndepend on the lake and\/or river and there is nothing they can do to alter this. As one\nelderly fisherman said:\nHow can we avoid the lake? We are fisherman, if we do not fish we do not survive, we will die.\nThis disease is always a problem for us.\nThe next section discusses the implications of research detailing local understand-\nings of bilharzia for strategies seeking to promote health education and the integrated\ncontrol of parasitic diseases.\nAttitudes to conveying health advice and the provision of treatment\nTo date, health education has not been prioritized in north-west Uganda. An attempt\nwas made to provide advice about the treatment and prevention of schistosomiasis\/\nbilharzia in 2004, but this was not repeated prior to treatment in 2005. Apart from\nthe dearth of information, it is also the case that the quality of information available\nand the style of delivery are problematic. To elaborate: health education materials\nsuch as pamphlets and posters about schistosomiasis, as well as ideas expressed at\nmeetings with \u2018the community\u2019, embrace biomedical approaches; and dialogue\ntypically takes the form of telling others how to think and behave. The complex\nrelationship between biomedical understandings of sickness and local understandings\nof misfortune (including, but not restricted to, biomedical misfortune) is, therefore,\noverlooked; as well as the day-to-day realities of eking out a living in a context where\nit is virtually impossible to avoid contact with contaminated water.\nThis is unfortunate. There is a rich and detailed ethnographic literature docu-\nmenting local understandings of health, sickness and misfortune in Uganda (see, for\nexample, Allen, 1991, 1992, 1997, 2006a; Middleton, 1960; Reynolds Whyte, 1997;\nMwanga et al., 2004; Southall, 1953 [2004]); and many other parts of East Africa\n(see, for example, Evans-Pritchard, 1937; Janzen, 1978; Geissler, 1998). Much of\nthis literature highlights the pluralistic nature of indigenous medical systems\nand demonstrates the way in which biomedical understandings of aetiology are\nincorporated into local understandings of sickness.\nWith respect to the people of Panyimur, it is not uncommon for adults to discuss\nresponses to sickness that involve seeking out biomedical treatment whilst simul-\ntaneously consulting a range of local healers, including herbalists, priests and ajogas.\nStaff from the Ministry of Health express little interest in understanding the nature\nof medical pluralism. This reflects a dearth of qualified personnel willing and able to\nspend time with people understanding their concerns and anxieties; as well as a belief\nthat local responses to sickness and misfortune are largely irrelevant to those\nconcerned with the delivery of the national control programme. The implications of\nthis for public policy are wide ranging. It is clearly not going to be possible to create\na demand for treatment with praziquantel and albendazole unless there is an\nengagement with local understandings and responses to the signs and symptoms of\nparasitic infections. This does not mean that local understandings should be taken at\nface value or that local healers should necessarily be professionalized or incorporated\ninto the official public health system. The point is simply that the Ministry of Health\n172 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\ndoes not have the capacity or desire to impose a treatment regime, so a case for\nrepeated doses of drugs being a necessity has to be made in a way that is convincing\nin a local context. At present, this is not the case. Rather, the activities of the national\ncontrol programme are viewed as tangential to the realities of daily life, and to both\ndisparage local knowledge and ignore the locally understood capacities of respected\nhealers living in the community. The next two sub-sections on \u2018health education\u2019 and\n\u2018delivery strategies\u2019 elaborate these points in more detail.\nHealth education\nWith respect to health education, interviews revealed that few adults had an\nadequate understanding of the rationale for repeated treatment for schistosomiasis\nand soil-transmitted helminths, including those distributing drugs. For instance, the\nidea that it might be possible to be infected and feel healthy was novel to virtually\nevery villager interviewed \u2013 as well as most local biomedical practitioners. It is hardly\nsurprising, then, that no one was conversant with the idea that taking drugs on a\nregular basis can reduce the possibility of developing serious complications from\ninfection. Indeed, many people stated that they had rejected treatment in 2005 on the\ngrounds that they thought it was inappropriate to take drugs if you felt \u2018well\u2019. To\nquote a local politician:\nIt is not in our culture to take drugs unless we are sick . the idea of taking a drug when you\nare well is strange to people here . people do not wish to take it, especially as it can make you\nsick.\nAnd a male informant resident in Ganda parish said:\n. people really think about it, before buying medicine as it costs so much money. If you don\u2019t\nfeel sick then you don\u2019t take medicine. Medicine is for sick people. The health workers turn you\naway if you don\u2019t feel sick, so why take \u2018praziquantel\u2019 now if you feel well?\nThe provision of detailed information about the aetiology and signs and\nsymptoms of infection with S. mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths, as well as the\nrationale for the programme and its relationship to prevention more generally, is\ncrucial, but this needs to be conveyed in ways that can be understood. During\nfieldwork in Panyimur, we did not come across any printed health education materials\nin the local language. There was a small amount of material in English, and this was\nused in primary schools, including a cartoon booklet about a small boy infected with\n\u2018bilharzia\u2019. In addition, there is a diagram of the life-cycle of schistosomiasis\/bilharzia\nin the registers used to document the uptake of drugs within the community.\nHowever, these sources of information are not widely available and, in some respects,\nthey are unhelpful. The cartoon booklet does not explain why it is so bad to become\ninfected with schistosomiasis\/bilharzia or why repeated treatment is an appropriate\nresponse. Instead, it suggests that children should avoid going into rivers and lakes.\nThis advice is untenable in Panyimur sub-county. In addition, both the cartoon\nbooklet and the illustration that appears in the registration books depict the\nschistosome worms as if they are under a microscope. This seems to be one reason\nwhy primary school children and also many adults believe that okudi bilharzia\nlooks similar to earthworms. As part of our research in primary schools, we asked\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 173\nchildren if they could describe the \u2018bilharzia worm\u2019. Overwhelmingly, the answer was\nthat it was long and black. Similarly, on being shown the illustration in the\nregistration books, people asked how it was possible for such big worms to enter their\nbodies.\nDelivery strategies\nImproving health education materials alone, however, will not be sufficient to\nreverse the fortunes of the national control programme in Panyimur. There are, in\naddition, major problems with the delivery of public health information and the\ndrugs. The current methods tend to be resented and resisted because they make\nmanifest social, political and economic hierarchies. They primarily rely upon on a\nsmall group of staff, either linked to the district headquarters in Nebbi or the Ministry\nof Health in Kampala. These staff hold impromptu meetings with local politicians,\nhealth care workers and whoever else happens to be around. Those who are sent from\nNebbi have a good understanding of aspects of local life, but tend to be disparaging\nof people living near the lake, accusing them of \u2018drunkenness\u2019, \u2018stubbornness\u2019 and\n\u2018promiscuity\u2019. They also feel disempowered by their lack of resources and by the\nscrutiny of the Ministry of Health in Kampala. Meanwhile, those who are\noccasionally sent to Panyimur from Kampala rarely speak the languages used in\nnorthern Uganda. On the one hand, their advice is commonly thought by local people\nto have a hidden agenda; on the other, some of the Kampala staff seemed to find it\nhard to escape from stereotypes prevalent in the south about \u2018primitive\u2019 northerners.\nConsequently, members of staff from Kampala were generally rather reluctant to\nintegrate or socialize in Panyimur and their attitudes were made manifest by, for\nexample, a refusal to eat local food and a reluctance to leave their four-wheel-drive\nvehicle \u2013 giving as reasons that people were filthy and would insist upon shaking\nhands, that local healers who were present were \u2018Satan\u2019 worshippers, or that the sun\nwas just too hot. Their attitude is encapsulated by one who said, as a casual aside,\nwhilst driving through the town of Masindi (the last major town one reaches before\ncrossing the river Nile to north-west Uganda): \u2018This is where civilization ends\u2019 (see\nLeopold, 2005, pp. 1\u201348; and Allen, 2006b, for further examples).\nAgainst this background, it is perhaps hardly surprising that existing strategies are\ngreeted with a certain amount of antipathy. People in Panyimur are acutely aware of\nthe disdain that some health educators and biomedical practitioners feel towards\nthem. The problem, moreover, is compounded by the fact that engagement with the\nintegrated programme of disease control by those who are meant to benefit by it\nrequires a large amount of voluntary labour. At international, national and district\nlevel, those implementing the programme are paid, but further down the system they\nare not. \u2018Communities\u2019 are expected to provide volunteers. Local politicians, school\nteachers, clinic staff and others have been willing to do so, in part, because it lends\nthem status. They also see themselves as assisting their neighbours and relatives; but\ntheir enthusiasm is inevitably limited and in the second year of the programme (when\nfieldwork was undertaken) they persistently expressed irritation at how much they\nwere being asked to do without remuneration, emphasizing that diligently spending\nseveral days at a time involved significant opportunity costs. Not only were they not\n174 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nbeing paid, but also they were unable to earn income or obtain food for their families\nby other means. In meetings with the vector control officer, some of the more\noutspoken local volunteers vociferously expressed their frustration. In some cases, the\nproblem with \u2018missing registers\u2019 turned out to be a manifestation of this tension: they\nwere being held back by drug distributors until they received some kind of\nrecompense for their work. A few informants made the point that there were\ntemptations to find ways of making money out of selling the drugs across the border\nin Congo.\nExerting greater control over the distribution and consumption of drugs was the\nreason given by staff from the Ministry of Health for changing the approach in 2005,\nwhereby drugs were given at clinics under the gaze of a health worker. This certainly\neased the burden on drug distributors, although they still felt it was onerous and that\nthey should have been remunerated. However, the change in distribution methods\nmay also have contributed to the decline in reported uptake of drugs in 2005,\ncompared to 2004, particularly among adults living in the remote and hilly parts of\nthe sub-county. The fact that so many adults living next to distribution sites rejected\nfree treatment (for example, 82\u00b72% of adults in Matusa village, Ganda parish,\ndeclined to take drugs for a second time in 2005) suggests, however, that it would be\ninappropriate to attribute a change in delivery strategy as the primary reason for\nrejecting drugs.\nWider implications of the research in Panyimur\nSo far, the findings presented in this paper relate to fieldwork undertaken in\nPanyimur, Nebbi district. Additional fieldwork was undertaken in Pandara, Pacego\nparish, Nebbi district and Wanseko, Masindi district, with a view to exploring the\ngeneralizability of key findings. Results emerging from these two field sites are\ndiscussed in turn.\nPandara is one of 26 villages in Pacego parish, Panyango sub-county. These\nvillages are located along the western bank of the river Nile and the majority of the\npopulation are Alur. Twenty villages had registers documenting the uptake of drugs\nin 2004 and 2005, one village had a register for 2004 only, and five villages had\nregisters for 2005 only. Drawing upon the available data documenting the number of\nadults that received treatment in 2004 and 2005, it emerged that 6257 adults came\nforward for treatment in 2004, but only 1162 returned for treatment in 2005. That is,\n81\u00b74% of adults were not re-treated in 2005.\nWith respect to Pandara village, a total of 754 adults were treated in 2004, but\nonly ten (1\u00b73%) returned for treatment in 2005. Twenty semi-structured interviews\nwere undertaken with adults residing in the village about the mass treatment\nprogramme and the key issues emerging were the following: a fear of side-effects\nassociated with taking \u2018praziquantel\u2019 (including a fear of over-dosing and a fear of\ndeath arising from treatment); a widespread belief in awola and the need for this to\nbe treated by ajogas rather than biomedical practitioners; and concerns about\nswallowing drugs under the direct gaze of health care workers (rather than being\ngiven them to take in one\u2019s own time). In addition, the rationale for mass treatment\non an annual basis was poorly understood.\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 175\nThe challenges facing the national control programme in Wanseko are again\nsimilar to those described for Panyimur, but in certain respects they are even more\nacute. Wanseko is located on the shores of Lake Albert, and it can be seen from\nPanyimur on a clear day. In theory, a ferry operates between the two centres, but it\nwas taken away for repairs in 2004, and to our knowledge, it has yet to return\n(informants stated that this is because a number of locally powerful people are\nmaking money by transporting people in canoes). It is located within one of the\nsouthern Ugandan kingdoms, Bunyoro, and the population is relatively hetero-\ngeneous. In addition to Lunyoro (the language of the Bunyoro kingdom), many\npeople speak Lougungu, and there are also many Alur migrants.\nThe central issue emerging during fieldwork was that drugs for the treatment of\nschistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths among adults were widely distributed\nin 2003, but were poorly distributed in 2004. Unfortunately, it was not possible to\nenumerate the number of adults that received treatment in 2003 and 2004 respectively\nas it proved enormously difficult to locate some of the registers. Only two of the three\nregisters for 2003 could be found and none of the registers for 2004 could be located,\nin spite of making considerable efforts to find them at the district headquarters in\nMasindi, the nearby health centre at Buliisa and the homes of various drug\ndistributors in Wanseko. However, on the basis of the 108 adults that we asked, 15%\nstated that they were given the opportunity to take the drug twice. (Research\nundertaken by SCI in 2004 confirms a low coverage rate, and it has been estimated\nat \u2018no more than 30%\u2019, personal communication with Russell Stothard.)\nThis failure to distribute drugs in Wanseko was surprising. While migrants, in\nparticular, were very poor, it is a place more fully integrated into the Ugandan\nnational economy than Panyimur; and a long-standing research programme on\nschistosomiasis has been running in Bugoigo, a little further south in Masindi district.\nThe reason for the failure was found to be linked to local politics and social relations.\nTwo related factors came to light. First, Wanseko has a much more heterogeneous\npopulation than that of Panyimur. There has been a history of conflict between\nlong-term residents of the Bunyoro kingdom and the more recent migrants (including\nthose from Nebbi district as well as those from the Congo). There is a great deal of\ndistrust and antipathy between some neighbours. Consequently, \u2018community mobili-\nzation\u2019 presents additional challenges. Second, the spirit of volunteerism that was\nfound to be problematic in Panyimur was almost completely absent, and this was\ncompounded by the way on which volunteers were appointed. Whereas in Panyimur\nand Pandara, local council politicians distributed the tablets themselves (partly to\nenhance their local standing), in Wasenko, staff from Masindi district headquarters\narranged with local counsellors the election of three male and three female drug\ndistributors. It would seem that the local counsellors in Wasenko had other sources\nof income and status. As a consequence, those elected as volunteers had markedly less\nincentive than the local counsellors in Panyimur and Pandara to be seen as working\nfor nothing. Indeed, most adults interviewed in Wasenko were incredulous about the\nexpectation that they should invest valuable time and energy in distributing drugs to\npeople who were not friends or relatives. Several informants, including staff at Buliisa\nhealth centre, were open about the fact that taking on responsibility for distributing\ndrugs was a calculation based on how much might be given in the form of food and\n176 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nother commodities (such as bicycles), how much might be earned by selling drugs in\nthe open market, and\/or whether or not it was worth accumulating a personal store\nof the drugs in case a member of their own family should fall ill in the future. One\nof those selected as a volunteer pointed out that he has eight children between the\nages of two and thirteen. He owns one cow and fishes for other people as he does not\nown a canoe. His wife makes rush mats that are sold in the market and the income\ngenerated from these activities is minimal. With so many dependants, it is simply not\nfeasible to spend a week handing out drugs free of charge. As an official from\nMasindi district said: \u2018volunteerism is actually not realistic\u2019.\nConclusions\nTop-down, vertical, biomedical interventions are notoriously difficult to successfully\nadminister. If they are not linked to an effective system to ensure compliance (such\nas enforceable legal measures), then they are dependent on the voluntary cooperation\nand support of local populations. Recent endeavours to ensure that condoms are\nwidely distributed and used to prevent the transmission of HIV; as well as endeavours\nto reduce the transmission of diarrhoeal diseases by hand-washing; and acute\nrespiratory infections by the administration of vitamin A tablets demonstrate how\ndifficult it can be to bring about behavioural change. The challenges presented to the\nUgandan national control programme for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted\nhelminths are no different. Indeed, in some ways, they are more acute. Schistosomiasis\nand soil-transmitted helminths are chronic infections that many people live with for\nyears, even decades, before developing clinical indicators of morbidity. The treatment\nis widely perceived by local people to be strong and potent, allegedly causing\nshort-term sickness and occasional fatalities. In a social, political and economic\ncontext where people struggle for survival, feel excluded from the political process and\nfrustrated by the fact that \u2018development\u2019 appears to be moving at a much faster pace\nin more favoured parts of the country, it is, perhaps, inevitable that resistance to\nwell-intentioned interventions has emerged. Refusing treatment is a form of what\nScott (1985) has called \u2018weapons of the weak\u2019.\nThat said, the national control programme for the integrated control of\nschistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths must be the right way forward. It\nprovides an opportunity to contain infection and reduce the chances of developing\nclinical signs of morbidity. Schemes to improve sanitation and water supply could\npotentially break cycles of transmission, but it is unrealistic to suppose that they will\nbe large enough and swift enough to bring about significant changes in the foreseeable\nfuture. Regular treatment is the only viable option. So, contrary to the arguments\npresented by critics such as Utzinger et al. (2003), the issue is not the underlying\napproach. It is the specific strategies for implementing it.\nHow, then, can the programme achieve one of its objectives of generating a\ndemand for drugs whereby adults seek treatment on a regular basis? This paper has\nshown that increasing the availability of education materials and revising some of the\nexisting procedures for disseminating information must be prioritized. In addition,\nserious endeavours should be made to communicate with local people in local\nlanguages. While it is probably untenable and, possibly, counterproductive to try to\nResisting treatment of neglected diseases in Uganda 177\nincorporate local healers into public health services, it would be useful to persuade\nsome of these healers to assist in alleviating anxieties about biomedical treatment for\nbilharzia. There is a need, too, for direct challenges to be made to local beliefs and\npractices that adversely affect health. People cannot be expected to make appropriate\nchoices if they do not know why they are being asked to do certain things. In short,\nvigorous efforts are required to promote biomedical evangelism.\nHere, there are grounds for optimism as there were innumerable indications\nduring fieldwork that local beliefs about sickness and misfortune, including beliefs\nabout bilharzia and awola, were much discussed and far from static. For example, a\n76-year-old married man, concerned about the implications of local beliefs in awola\nfor the national control programme, made the following observation:\nAwola is a poisonous term ... it has made so many people die . if a child is suffering from, say,\nmalaria, people say \u2018it\u2019s awola\u2019, but how can someone suck diseases which are in the blood by\nthe mouth? It\u2019s impossible! In my household we do not believe in awola. If a child is suffering\nfrom fever . then the child must be taken to the dispensary for medication. We totally refuse\nthe idea of awola.\nIn a slightly different vein, it was striking how quickly fears and anxieties about\n\u2018praziquantel\u2019 could be alleviated, if time was spent discussing the rationale for mass\ntreatment, and in 2006, there were reports that some people in Panyimur complained\nwhen treatment was only made available in schools, due to lack of funds (personal\ncommunication with Narcis Kabatereine, October 2006).\nHowever, to make the programme work, organizational changes will be necessary.\nDistribution of drugs is never politically neutral. In this case, it will only work if the\npower dynamics of distribution are socially acceptable. In other words, the right\npeople have to be chosen to distribute and monitor drugs. This should primarily\ninclude influential local people who are adequately supported by the national and\ndistrict authorities. It may also involve empathetic non-locals. This may sound\nobvious and, indeed, it is recommended in the SCI guidelines, but at present it is not\nwhat happens in those parts of Uganda in which this research was undertaken. Those\nselected at all levels will also have to receive some form of remuneration. It cannot\nbe assumed that voluntary labour is a viable option for most people living in\nimpoverished conditions.\nIn addition, it may be necessary to consider socially appropriate compliance\nprocedures. Usually, discussions with people in Panyimur, Pandara and Wanseko\nended with a long and detailed explanation about parasitic infections, the life-cycle of\nS. mansoni, the rationale for mass treatment etc. We would then ask for questions.\nA very common response was the following: \u2018Why are there no by-laws to stop people\ninfecting others? People can be seen defecating and urinating in the lake, but no one\nstops them. Many people do not have pit latrines. Why can\u2019t rules be made to make\nthem have one?\u2019 Older people still remember public health programmes for malaria,\nsleeping sickness and other diseases that were linked to compliance procedures. This\nused to be a major preoccupation of chiefs and headmen. If bilharzia is really so\nserious, why, people asked us, is it not dealt with in the same way? It seems a\nreasonable question.\nAll the foregoing discussion leads to a final observation about the Ugandan\nprogramme. People we interviewed, including the District Medical Officer, were\n178 M. Parker, T. Allen and J. Hastings\nbemused by the idea that a demand for treatment will arise from those benefiting, and\nthat praziquantel and albendozole will then be purchased indefinitely at the end of the\ncurrent period of free distribution. Even if people become aware of significant changes\nto their overall well-being, which is currently not the case, how will effective demands\nbe made for continued mass treatment? The people living near Lake Albert have a\nlimited voice, and they have insufficient income for marketing to become an economic\nproposition for private pharmacists. Some may complain to the staff of SCI and local\nvector control personnel. But it will not have much effect unless the initiative itself\ncontinues to receive funds and donated drugs, or a highly subsidized supply becomes\navailable from another source. At present, it is hard to see a viable alternative to\nsustained international aid and persistent international lobbying. In this respect, the\nsituation described here is unlikely to be exceptional. There are reasons why the\n\u2018neglected tropical diseases\u2019 have been so widely ignored, and those reasons cannot\njust be wished away.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is based on fieldwork funded by SCI, Imperial College, under the auspices\nof the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and the authors are grateful to Professor\nAlan Fenwick and Fiona Fleming from SCI for their assistance.
