Introduction \nIn this paper I consider the role and value of visual cultures in figuring British \nAsian identifications with landscape. Landscape is positioned here as a material \nsignifier of identification with land, territory and environments which contribute \ntowards with formal and informal connectedness with national cultures and \ncitizenship. British Asian citizenship is figured through the experience of their \nresidence in colonial territories within South Asia (including India, Pakistan, \nBangladesh, and Sri Lanka) and East Africa (including Kenya, Uganda, and Malawi). \nThe South Asian experience of these lived landscapes and their particular political \nstatus within colonial territories influences their connection with landscapes in Britain \nand \u201eBritishness\u201f. This research explores the presence of landscapes, which are \nrepresented, refracted and memorialised in the form of visual cultures within the \nBritish Asian home. Visual cultures of landscape which are situated within the South \nAsian home are examined in this paper as critical modes of securing a sense of being \nand belonging within Britain, for this group of post-colonial migrants. I also argue \nthat visual cultures, in the British Asian home, such as photographs, fabrics, pictures, \nand paintings, have meaning and value beyond their textual content. This research is \nan exercise in reading visual cultures through a materialist lens, which allows for an \nexamination of their place in the embodied practices of making \u201ehome\u201f in Britain. The \nobjects of visual culture considered here, presence the landscapes of South Asian \nmigration, thus importing \u201eother\u201f landscapes, previously shaped by colonial \ngovernance (Drayton 2000) into a British context. There is a movement and \n 4 \ncirculation of landscape imagery, which reflects post-colonial experiences of living in \ncolonial landscapes in East Africa and South Asia. The presence of these landscapes \nin visual and material cultures shape South Asian domestic spaces and illustrate the \nvalue of landscape to post-colonial residents within Britain.  \n \nThere is a need within cultural geography to attend to the materiality of the \nvisual cultures that we engage with. This research demonstrates the value of \ninvestigating this material dimension, through the process of researching domestic \nlandscapes of the post-colonial migrant. These visual cultures refract, represent, and \nare metonymical signifiers of other environments and landscapes. They also refract \nsensory engagements with other places, landscapes and natures. Shards of other \nenvironments are enclosed in these visual cultures. In the domestic space a collage of \nother environments is produced through the display and collection of visual cultures \nin the home. They are significant in their material presence in that they ground \nidentification in tangible and textural engagements. Their materiality of the visual is \nan extension of anthropological interests in the biography of material cultures, and the \nnature of domestic cultures in connecting across temporal and spatial axes of lived \nexperience(Appadurai, 1986). If the materiality of the visual is an additional register \nof the text, then we need to extend research on the way that material cultures operate \non the scale of the visual; the sighting of material textures are as valuable as their \nbeing situated within a spatial matrix (Holt and Barlow, 2000; Tolia-Kelly, 2001). \nThe aesthetics of the material cultures in the home form part of their sensory \nvocabulary, which in turn needs some attention. \n \nMaterial and visual cultures are positioned here as active shapers of post-\ncolonial identification with landscape. Their active place in the imagination of \n 5 \ngeographical relationships is examined through the following examples. However, \ntheir power is not limited to the domestic sphere. For almost all of the women in the \nstudy, the landscapes they had engaged with prior to migration have sustained \nrelevance in their current lives. The presence of these visual landscapes translates the \nexperience of African, Indian and other Asian experiences of landscapes into creating \na set of familiar textures in this new domestic scene. Britishness and British homes \nare changing as a result of the migration of peoples and their landscape imaginaries.  \n \nVisual Cultures allow for an empowered citizenship to evolve in the process of \nmaking home. As Parkin (1999) has argued, once migrants have experienced loss or \nforced expulsion, they continue to bear the fear of displacement. This fear in an era \nwhere racism continues and exclusionary politics are evident in national media and \npublic cultures, migrant communities use their connections with multiple provenances \nto strengthen their foundations of residency here in Britain. Their domestic sphere \nbecomes an archive of these multiple sites, sounds, and sensory textures of \nenfranchisement and belonging. The visual cultures which shape these new textures of \nhome are shot through with memory of \u201eother\u201f spaces of being. These ensure that \nmaterial landscapes in Britain are continually remade through the aesthetics and \ntextures of post-colonial landscapes in East Africa and Asia.  \n \nInterpreting these visual cultures requires a grounded understanding of post-\ncolonial identity and citizenship. Their interpretation and de-coding are problematic, \nas they are locked into the biographical imaginary of the women. Some of these \nvalues and interpretations have been shared through the interview process, but there is \na need to extend the interpretive tools necessary for effective visual analysis when \n 6 \nworking with post-colonial migrants. This is because, as writers like Appadurai \n(1996) have argued, hegemonic conventions of interpreting texts exist which are \nconstrained to culturally specific interpretation. Readings of specific texts in socio-\ncultural contexts allows researchers to incorporate an inclusive strategy necessary for \nunderstanding mobile, and dynamic, post-colonial visual vocabularies and cultures. \nThis research evidences a move towards developing an inclusive, culturally situated \nvisual methodology that allows for the examination of post-colonial geographies \nrefracted through visual and material cultures.  \n \nJackson\u201fs (2000) call for a renewed engagement with materiality is in some \nways arguing for a varied figure of matter within geography. Here, I have privileged \nthe (cultural) materialist approach to understanding post-colonial geographies. This \nbuilds on the extensive body of work within geography that has been based on \nWilliams\u201f (1958; 1973) approach towards cultural texts, and other\u201fs treatment of \nlandscape as material (Jackson, 1959; Lowenthal, 1979; 1985;1988; Meinig, 1979; \nSauer, 1925). I will suggest that material cultures signify the positioning of post-\ncolonial identity within the context of Britishness and the British landscape. The \ncomplicatedness of geographies of post-colonial identity has been considered in \nrecent geographical writing (Blunt, 2000; Blunt and McEwan, 2002). Here, post-\ncolonial enfranchisement to a sense of belonging and citizenship is unravelled through \nan interrogation of visual and material cultures in the domestic sphere and migrant \ncultures. These cultures refract connections to landscapes of value and meaning, \nforming a body of material cultures in the home that are important to senses of \ncultural and individual identity. \n \n 7 \nThe cultural value of landscape to an individual\u201fs sense of being and \nbelonging is an essential component of my argument (see also Anderson, Carvalho \nand Tolia-Kelly, 2001). The role of landscape in supporting a sense of citizenship or a \nsense of identity has been discussed by geographers over many decades (Cosgrove, \n1990; Jackson, 1979; Relph, 1976; Tuan, 1979;). Additionally social and cultural \ngeography has considered migratory groups\u201f experience of exclusion in British \nlandscapes (Agyeman, 1990; Agyeman, 1991; Kinsman, 1995; Malik, 1992; Sibley, \n1995; 1998). Many of these academic studies incorporate arguments for inclusive \nlandscapes and support an ethical, inclusive politics of appropriation, representation \nand belonging. This is because the experience of exclusion faced by migrants within \nBritish landscapes, are imbedded in regimes of racism, both institutional and social. \nBy exploring the way in which migrant communities create a sense of \u201ehome\u201f we can \nsee how this process incorporates a series of visual and material cultures, which \nrefract connections with landscapes of enfranchisement and belonging. The presence \nof visual and material cultures in the homes of South Asians post-migration operate as \ncounter weights to the experience of disenfranchisement in the British landscape and \nthe experience of marginalisation. \n \nShazia  \u201cIder mere swas bund hojata he, Pakistan me mere ghar koola tha\u201d \n\u201cHere (in England) I feel suffocated, my breathing is constrained, in Pakistan \nmy home was open\u201d \n \nShazia makes his statement in the midst of talking about her life in England \ncompared to her family life in Pakistan. Her suffocation is an expression of her \nfeelings of being physically constrained, as a result of being an Asian woman isolated \n 8 \nin Britain without social networks, and without the mobility and freedom that she \nonce had in Pakistan. Shazia\u201fs home is a store of connections to the social and cultural \ngeography of Pakistan, it is a material site of respite from the hardness of living in a \nforeign country. For the women in the study such as Shazia, these home cultures \nensure an inclusive engagement with a cultural nationalism, signified through \ndomestic cultures. This is of a relational value to communities who are un-fixed from \na seemingly coherent and exclusionary national culture. Stuart Hall (1990;1997; 2000; \nHall and du Gay, 1996) has theorised cultural mechanisms through which post-\ncolonial communities living in Britain are able to position themselves in a complex \nmatrix of Britishness; visual and material cultures refract, signify and record these \ncomplex negotiations, uprootings, and resettlements.  \n \nThe resourcefulness of migrant communities faced with uprooting and \nresettling has been the focus of many studies within sociology (Ahmed et al 2003) \nand social anthropology (Lovell, 1998). Some authors have attended to visual and \nmaterial cultures as artefacts when communities such as Palestinians (Slymovics, \n1998), or the black African community during apartheid (Lovell, 1998), were \npolitically displaced. Most notable are those who have examined the mechanisms \nthrough which refugees and migrants affirm their citizenship in the domestic sphere \n[Mehta and Belk, 1991; Parkin, 1999) in relation to the experience of exclusion or \nmarginality from their new social landscape. These cultural materials become \noperational as artefacts because they are remnants of a past social life and provide \nevidence of a social history that is now intangible. Within Britain the networks of \nmigrant communities - significantly those migrating as a result of British Imperial \nlabour requirements - have been conceptually framed as \u201eethnic minorities\u201f, \n 9 \n\u201eimmigrants\u201f and other such problematic terms (Samers, 1998). Here, British Asians \nare considered as a diasporic community situated within a variety of connections with \nlandscapes and citizenships of settlement and migration. Such communities cannot be \nfigured as a discrete racial, national or religious group.Instead they are defined \nthrough their dynamic history shaped by colonial economic, cultural and \u201eorientalist\u201f \nregimes of definition and rule (see Brah, 1996;1999; Gilroy, 1993a; 1993b; Said, \n1978; 1993 ) \n \nThere is a growing need to investigate the material cultures of racialised \ncommunities within Britain, and their role in everyday cultural practices of these \ngroups, within domestic landscapes. Although there has been much work that has \naddressed the problematic position of migrant communities within Britain and British \ncitizenship [Brah, 1996; Cohen, 1997; Gilroy, 1987; 1991; Safran, 1991; Vertovec, \n1997; 1999 ] there is a need to examine the effect of an exclusionary British national \nidentity on their environmental relationships with landscapes which are therefore \ncritical in constituting post-colonial geographies of belonging and citizenship. \nLocating these geographies of post-colonial migrants can be achieved through the \nmechanism promoted in this paper; by interrogating value of visual and material \ncultures in the processes of identification (Tolia-Kelly, 2004). Miller\u201fs (1995; 1998) \nwork has been exemplary in the attention paid to intimate, grounded and located \npersonal engagements with the materials in the everyday which matter carving an \nintellectual space through the development of an anthropological institution of \nresearch attending to \u201ematerial cultures\u201f. However this body of work, which \nrepresents a shift from Williams\u201f cultural materialism tends to map intimate cultural \npractices. However, social relationships with material cultures can uncover the \n 10 \nsometimes occluded, power of political identifications shaped through race, gender \nand sexuality. Visual and material cultures matter in these regimes of identification. In \nthe process of collecting and displaying visual and material cultures, South Asians \nbuild a sense of a home place. The display of materials such as photographs and \nmementos connect individuals to people, places and landscapes in ways which inform \nthe sense of self. For the South Asian population in Britain their connections include \npeople, places and environments encountered before and during their migration \nroutes. Domestic materials activate cultural flows for an imagined community formed \nthrough global networks, these are termed by Appadurai as ethnoscapes (Appadurai, \n1996: 33). The experience of resettlement involves creating a space where history, \nheritage and identity are inscribed in those few home possessions either carried with \nthem on the journey, or acquired since their arrival. Importantly visual and material \ncultures are prismatic devices which import \u201eother\u201f landscapes into the British one, \nand thereby shift notions of Britishness, and British domestic landscapes.  \n \nMany geographers have argued for the reinscription of marginalised \ngeographies (Philo, 1998; Rose, 1993; Sibley, 1995) including racialised \ncommunities, into academic literature. Their biographies and their voices have been \nmarginal to academic research, their identity often being the object of research \n(Sharma et al. 1996). This is a project in the inscription of the knowledges and \nexperiences of the marginalised to be included (McDowell, 1992; England, 1994). \nSouth Asian identity is figured here as dialectically linked to experiences of colonial \nlandscapes, as memorialised in material cultures.  British Asianess is figured as \ndynamically constituted through the co-ordinates of various environmental \nrelationships. Visual and material cultures in the home signify identifications with \n 11 \nlandscapes outside of Britain, but are valued relationally to their sighting and situation \nin Britain. South Asian identity is figured through being and living in the British \nlandscapes of exclusionary and marginalising national culture (Brah, 1996; Gilroy, \n1987). \n \n2. Methods \nThe findings presented in this paper are based on group and individual \ninterviews with British South Asian women recruited in the suburban London \nBorough of Harrow and the more socially deprived London borough of Brent (both in \nNorth-West London). I recruited women from two ready-made groups based at \ncouncil funded Asian advice centres; both groups were women-only groups co-\nordinated by the centres. My decision to limit the research group to women-only \ngroups is not rooted in an explicit feminist politics, but one based on a political \ndecision to privilege women\u201fs voices normally marginalised within and without the \nBritish Asian community. The research method and design is therefore grounded in \nthe women\u201fs connections with other landscapes and environments as signified \nthrough visual cultures at home. I firstly recruited in-depth groups from an initial \nfocus group on \u201elandscape and belonging\u201f in which the women discussed their \nexperiences of migration to Britain and their experiences of living here. I combined \nthe use of the in-depth group method with a home tour where the women showed me \nvalued visual cultures in their homes. This process effectively positioned the women \nas active in representing their own identification within a set of social and cultural \nspaces including their homes. The in-depth groups were successful in giving a social \ncontextualisation to the statements made by the women. These contextualisations \nwere aided in the group discussions and interviews through their reference to visual \n 12 \nand material cultures such as maps, pictures, objects and fabrics chosen by them to \nsupport their narrative. These moments gave substantive depth to their recorded and \ntranscribed testimonies.  Recording group and individual discussions within this \ncontext ensured that the transcripts represented a socially contextualised and situated \nset of understandings and values of British Asian women. \n  \nFeminist geographers have paved the way in conducting research with \nexcluded members of society, by using reflexive and empowering research methods \n(Burgess, Limb et al. 1988a; Burgess, Limb et al. 1988b; Patai, 1991; Dwyer, 1993; \nEngland, 1994; Rose, 1997; Valentine, 1997; Barbour and Kitzinger, 1999; \nWilkinson, 1999). Mohammed (2001) extends the debate further by considering the \nrole of Asian researcher, working with Asian women. As an Asian woman working \nwith other Asian women, I do not set out to claim any primary authority in the \nresearch process, but acknowledge that this positioning has allowed me access, and a \nvisualisation of research questions which were drawn from my own sense of South \nAsian  identification. There were substantial differences within the group, based on \nlanguage, religion, class and social networks. My ability to communicate in Hindi, \nGujarati and English allowed me to gain a rapport; trust through communication was \nbuilt up. Overall it is difficult to attribute my access and successful facilitation of \nAsian women\u201fs groups to any single factor mentioned, but my gender and language \nskills were equally valuable in achieving the group meetings as was my skin colour \nand biography. These countered difficulties that other researchers have faced when \nfacilitating with Asian groups (Burgess, 1996). \n \n 13 \nThere are political dimensions to my focus exclusively on South Asian \nwomen. Within society it is recognised that this group faces \u201etriple oppression\u201f on the \nbasis of their racialised identity, gender and marginalised positioning within \ncommunity politics. This positioning has limited the recognition of their contribution \nto social heritage, history and community dynamics. Thus, situating geographical \nknowledge and values within their sites of active participation and living allowed me \nto record their thoughts, and intimate geographies not normally engaged with. \nHowever, there is a danger that situatedness can create separate and essential \nunderstandings of lives that are not linked dialectically to social systems of \nknowledge, power and lived experience (Harvey, 1992). In recognition of this fact, I \nwas able to ground my discussions in a variety of social contexts thus offering a \ntriangulation of methods. The one-to-one interview and tour of the women\u201fs home \nwas precisely designed to interview women within a socio-cultural space of their \nprimary control and making. The grounding of this research at home offered the \nwomen opportunities to talk in a material context rather than in an abstract one. Prior \nto this \u201etour\u201f the ground had been prepared for the women to discuss their \nrelationships with other places and environments outside Britain, that were signified \nin their homes in the material cultures situated there. The tour of the home led by the \nwoman herself, was of the three or four of the most important visual cultures in her \nhome that were important to her sense of belonging and \u201ehome\u201f. The interview \nallowed women to extend their testimonies made in groups, to areas where they could \nreflect on material objects rather than abstract ideas. It was during these tours that it \nbecame clear that the women engaged with visual cultures in a similar way to \nmaterials that weren\u201ft explicitly visual texts. \n  \n 14 \n3. Heterogeneity and South Asian women\u2019s identity \nAll the women in the groups defined themselves as \u201eAsian\u201f however, through \nthe process of mapping their biographies it became clear that the groups migratory \nroutes included traversing twenty-two different countries; many had traversed more \nthan two continents including Africa, Europe, North America, and Asia. At the same \ntime as having varied biographies, the women considered themselves as being \nconnected through cultural networks, which produced and revealed a community with \na common identity. These are \u201eglobal ethnoscapes\u201f created through technological \nnetworks of satellite TV programming, Bollywood films (Gillespie, 1995)and music \n(Dudrah and Tyrell, 2001; Sharma, Hutnyk et al. 1996). Within this networked \ncommunity, there are subsections of groupings marked through religion, language, \nregional identity (Modood, 1990; Dwyer, 1994; Modood, 1994; Dwyer, 2000). Within \nBritish India (prior to Independence in 1947) the group that I have worked with would \nhave defined themselves as Indian, in relation to being British, however post-\nmigration some of these women have considered themselves to be Bangladeshi, \nPakistani or Indian. This is as a result of their identifying with other nations that they \nhave lived in post-migration from India; in the case of East African Indians they have \nexperienced double-migration (Bhachu, 1985)and have also identified themselves as \nUgandan, Kenyan, and Tanzanian. Many of these definitions are activated as women \ndefine themselves in relation to experiencing exclusion from a sense of Britishness. \nThe basis of these varied definitions can be spatially routed, and can be connected to \ncultural and familial alliances to various identities. These are complex identifications, \nyet are pertinent to the definition of Britishness and unravelling the genealogy of \nBritish heritage (Gregory, 1994; Clarke, 1990). \n \n 15 \n4. Placing the Visual \n \nThe value of researching the domestic visual cultures with this community is \nto examine the link between migration on the use of visual cultures in examining their \nrole in identity formations; in making home; and creating a territory of belonging in \nBritain. I have outlined the significance of these cultures in the home post-migration; \nin this section I consider specific examples to examine their effect and use.  \nWhilst walking around their homes, women pointed out things that were explicitly \nvisual cultures such as photographs, but also objects that were visually important to \nthem (including fabrics, textiles, curios). During the process of examining their role in \nthe home, it became clear to me that visual cultures were simultaneously effective in \ntheir visual and textural properties. The texture of a visual object such as a \nphotograph, print, or fabric dynamically informs the viewers\u201f interpretation of the \nimage. The scent, touch, and the prismatic quality of the materials of culture were the \nprimary texture of engagement with it, or certainly equal in value to that of the text. \nEssentially the material texture of the visual artefact had a critical significance.  \n \nFor migrant populations that have traversed several landscapes to take up \nresidency in Britain, the experience of migration from a previous home has meant the \nforced discarding of objects, photographs, clothes, documents and furniture, in the \ntask of uprooting and re-rooting. For many of the women, the biography of the \nmaterial cultures were themselves as significant as they had traversed these \nlandscapes with them.  On attaining secure accomodation post-migration, the value of \nthose few objects preserved is enhanced in the process of their appropriation and \ndisplay. Some of these items are purchased on trips back to Kenya, India or Pakistan, \n 16 \nas souvenirs which in turn are reconstructed through a lens of distance and loss. \nSocial anthropologists (Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton, 1981; Appadurai, \n1986) and cultural geographers (Rose, 2000; 2003) have written on the value of \nmaterial and visual cultures (including photographs) within the domestic sphere. All \nhave contributed to the understanding of the way that these cultures are products of \nrelations that extend beyond the home (Rose 2003:5). By attending to the textural \nvalue of visual cultures, my analysis aims to uncover how they operate as prismatic \ndevices which refract migratory landscapes and biographical experiences into the \ncontemporary scene of \u201ehome\u201f. The prismatic qualities of these visual cultures refract \nembodied memories and sensory relationships with lived landscapes. The values and \nmeanings assigned to these visual cultures indicate the women\u201fs connection with \nthese refracted landscapes of belonging, which are critical in securing an enfranchised \nspace of \u201ehome\u201f. The material nature and biography of these visual cultures are \nconsidered here alongside the shift in their meaning in their new sites of display, post-\nmigration. In the \u201etour\u201f, the women are asked to choose visual materials which are \nimportant in securing their sense of belonging and home; these are dynamically \nfigured through their current siting in domestic landscapes of South Asians in Britain. \n \n5. The Photo-object \nAs a visual culture, photography operates in different ways in the social and \ncultural contexts of the home. As a media it engages with a different \u201eway of seeing\u201f \nto other forms of visual media; gazing onto photographs is very different to viewing a \nfilm or a painting. My central concern here is the value of the photograph beyond the \ntextual imprint imbedded in the photographic paper (Pinney, 1995; Ryan, 1997). In \nthe context of South Asian post-colonial migration, the preservation of family \n 17 \nphotographs is limited; often these types of materials are left behind or shipped. Often \nthey are peripheral to other essential items needed in the process of resettlement. The \neffect of having a photograph in these circumstances enhances their social meaning \nand value. They record real moments and events, resonating with a memory of \nrelationships in particular geographies. The photographs are fragments of real \nbiographies. However, the photographs symbolise broader oral histories and personal \nrelationships with people and place. They become symbolic of these places and the \nsocial histories in these places. The images discussed here are chosen by the women \nas being important texts in their homes. When expressing the values and meanings of \nphotographs these can also be read as artefacts which trigger social histories of the life \nof South Asians prior to migration to Britain. Knappett (2002) describes photographs \nas simultaneously iconical and indexical: metaphor and image. Imagination and the \ntext become conflated, imbuing the photograph with narratives beyond the image. \nMulti-sensory experiences are recalled through the text of a photo \u2013 the heat of the \nsun, the scent of the jasmine flower, the feel of the humid air, and other stories. The \nphotograph also triggers memory from the imagination of other \u201ctexts\u201d or textures; \nthrough it family narratives and recollections of a past life are evoked. In the home \ntheir effect is to re-connect with other landscapes and places of enfranchisement. \nFragments of remembered landscapes are lodged in the image through symbols, \naesthetics and textures. These photographs operate as metonymical devices which \ntrigger memories of a nation, an intimate garden or a sense of self connected to oral \nnarratives of the past. Over time these photographs themselves attain \u201crelic\u201d status; \nrevered and treasured, this is exemplified in Sheetal\u201fs relationship with a photograph \nof Tanzanian landscape below.  \n \n 18 \n5.1 A piece of my heart. \nFigure 1 \u2013 Bismarck Rocks, Tanzania \nSheetal brings with her a photograph that she describes as Dil no Tuklo, \u201ea \npiece of my heart\u201f. The photograph is not a representation of this landscape, but a part \nof her core identity. Sheetal was brought up in Tanzania throughout the 60s and 70s. \nHer grandfathers\u201f family had travelled there as a response to the incentives offered to \nIndians by the British colonial government in India to develop the economic \nlandscape of the East African protectorate. Sheetal, like many Asians in East Africa, \nmoved to Britain in 1972 and now lives in an extensive family home in Harrow. \nSheetal\u201fs reverence of this photograph was so intense that I did not, as I had wanted, \ntake the photograph away to get copied. It would have been unethical to risk losing \nthe photograph in transit, it would have had the effect of mutilation. Her relationship \nwith the photo demonstrates some of the real, imaginary and symbolic values that are \nimbued in the material of the photograph. The text itself is an image of the Bismark \nRocks (later named Mwanza Rocks) found alongside the lakefront on Lake Victoria. \nThis image is intimately connected to her sense of self, which is dependent on this \npiece being in place, in her place of home. \n \n\u201cThis is from my home town in Mwanza. This has been our focal point. .all my family \nand almost everybody from Mwanza has this place as their memoir. . . Yeah loads of \nmemories. And everybody had their special thing with Mwanza rocks. . .you know \nsomething connects. Yeah central to almost anybody if you ask from Mwanza, they \nwill have something to talk about. Where the rocks were, it was intriguing every time \nwe went there. . The rocks are perched so delicately on each other . . .This was a place \nof leisure where the whole family would travel there to have a picnic and watch the \n 19 \nsunset.  . This has been our focal point.. . .all my family and almost everybody from \nMwanza has this place as a memoir.\u201d (Sheetal) \n \nThe photograph is preserved in a plastic covering. In her home it is displayed \nin the intimate space of her bedroom. The plastic covering indicates that it is not fixed \nin situ. There is an incongruity between the reverence Sheetal has for it and the flimsy \ncovering of shiny plastic which obscures the scene. At the sight of the photograph \nSheetal recalls the social life of her family having picnics at Lake Victoria. Along \nwith visualising this scene she remembers the heat of the summer, the scents and \nsounds of food cooking, children playing and the rush of the water. Inscribed within \nher recollection are sensory textures which add dimension to her minds eye image of \nthis past landscape, but which also operate as an embodied memory; experienced as a \nsensory recollection. This memory is fixed in a sensory experience in a particular \nspace-time(Edgerton 1995; Sutton 2000). The recall of a physical memory is that of \nan experience beyond the formal documentation of the past. The textures recalled are \nbeyond the parameters of the photograph; they are operative as independent triggers \nof the memory of this scene. The refracted memories are given co-ordinates through \nthese biographical landmarks, which assist the interpretation of events, thoughts, and \nsensations from the past, in the contemporary sphere. These are a material store of \nsensory experiences not part of a linear geographical route, but a collage of sensory of \nidentifications (Tolia-Kelly, 2001).  \n \nThe photograph transports Sheetal to being at the rocks, the text takes her to \nthe memory of Bismark rocks, to a place where she is able to \u201cconnect\u201d and explore \nher own mental and emotional imaginary. This was a place that allowed her to \n 20 \ncontemplate and wonder; there is a sense of freedom imbued in her narrative linked \nboth to her adolescence and to her distance from Tanzania. This was the place where \nshe had her first dates, her first kiss, and also the place where family relationships \nwere strengthened through doing group activities. The activity, through memory, gets \npolished and embellished with positive events; the memory is airbrushed, smooth and \nshiny. Symbolic of a rose-tinted adolescence, family life and a place of connection \nand belonging, East Africa is symbolised through the image of Bismark rock. \n \n\u201cThis is like families would go down there. Couples would sit down there. There\u201fs my \ndad and mum with their friends, and there was numerous hours of fun and talk. Shanti \n(peace). Five o\u201fclock you would go there and not finish until it went dark. There are \nthree or four good hours. Akho time nikali jai. (All time would pass away).\u201d (Sheetal) \n \nThe photograph becomes a means of \u201ebeing\u201f within this powerful place in \nSheetal\u201fs memory. The experience of migration changes this from a vital memory of \nthis experience to a memoir, a place that is active only as a memory of these feelings \nof connection and an embodied wholeness. The photograph becomes a store of social \nhistory rather than a place which is vital and present which can be reconnected with. \nThese, in the context of Sheetal\u201fs description, resonate with her belief that there is no \nchance of returning to Tanzania to live there again as a permanent citizen. The \nmemories of this social life are also engaged with in the practices of making home \nhere and her social life. This image is displayed in Sheetal\u201fs home-space, here the \ndomestic landscape in Britain is contextualised through Tanzania; real moments of \nlived experience in Britain are figured through her nostalgia and this symbol of a past \nlandscape. \n 21 \n5.2 Family frames. \nFigure. 2 Kajal\u201fs Family \n \n \nFigure 2, shows a photo of Kajal as a young girl with her brother and his new \nwife. At the sight of the photograph, Kajal was in tears. She hasn\u201ft seen her brother or \nher nieces and nephews in years, as she has not been back to Bangladesh in years. The \nphotograph refracts the memories of the landscape in Kajal\u201fs village Balishastra (its \nnearest town is Molobibazaar) as it was pre-migration. Kajal is a British citizen who \nis intimately connected with the landscape of Bangladesh, her migration to Britain \nsituates her in-between a belonging to a now imagined landscape of Bangladesh and a \nlived experience of living in Harlesden in Brent. Through distance the photograph \nbecome symbolic of a pre-migratory landscape of home, which reminds her of her \nloneliness and marginality in Britain. Through time this image has become a symbol \nof Kajal\u201fs intimate emotional relationship with this place. The picture itself is very \nformal; the backdrop is a classic iconographical landscape in a photographer\u201fs studio. \nThere is a river or lake in the foreground and palms to the right. There are flowers and \nclouds annotating the classic scene. This type of luscious scenery as backdrop is not \nuncommon in Indian studio photography as it conforms to a very particular set of \nrules (Pinney 1997); the formality of the sitters is in tune with the formality of the \nbackdrop.  The colours in the photograph are intensified and the forms are defined \nheavily by the brightness and solidity of the colours worn. There is a hyper-intensity \nthat is imbued in the image through aesthetics. The photograph has been sent to her by \nher brother and sits in her living room, next to images of the Islamic site of haaj \n(pilgrimage), Medina. The proximity of the two indicates the value reverence she has \n 22 \nfor this photograph. The image of Medina also indicates her alternative cultural \nidentification with the landscapes of Islam. \n \nKajal describes Balishastra, and her family which are framed within the \nphotograph, with emotion. The picture is a memorialisation of her family, not just \nthose within the frame, but also those excluded. Through it Kajal talks through her \nfamily history and their current residences. The term for taking a photo in Gujarati \nand Hindi is to \u201eketch\u2019- this means to take or to draw. When translated it seems that \nthere is a sense of taking something away from the scene and set in the material of the \nphotograph. The image has drawn from the sitters, but also from the landscape of \nBangladesh. Pinney (1995) describes how, within this belief system, the photograph is \nrevered actively as an icon of the life of the person. As individual portraits are made \n(funerals, weddings, birth) these portraits become the story of that person, and \nencompass the being of that person. On prayer after death, there are rituals and rites \nperformed on the photograph of the person in the same way as rites and rituals are \nperformed on chromolithographs of religious icons. Pinney argues that amongst \nIndians \n \n\u201cmost have a number of old images which continue to accrue potency as they \nbecome accreted with marks of repeated devotion \u2013 vermillion tilaks placed \non the forehead of deities, the ash from incence sticks, smoke stains from \nburning camphor.\u201d (Pinney, 1995:111) \n \nFor Kajal this image is a direct tracing of a significant and material moment. \nThe physicality of photography is exactly that, it is a tracing of the light reflected on \n 23 \nthe solid materials in the frame. The family image is taken from that reflection in the \nlens. This photo is given a reverence because of the tracings of that moment, but also \nbecause it has been elevated from that moment, made potent through the reverence \nthat Kajal gives it. This reverence in the everyday imbues the photo with a value \nbeyond a sentimental record. Pinney describes this process as giving the photo \n\u201cbreath\u201d, the photo evolves its own life through the context of display, but is imbued \nwith a \u201csoul\u201d through the reverential way in which it is treated by Kajal. These photos \nare singular, they are not numerous and therefore made more precious. For Kajal, this \nis a piece of her family \u201ctaken\u201d from them, and watched over by her. Her relationship \nwith the image is about the recording of a past moment, but more crucially to keep \nthis moment alive through making it potent in the practices of living in the everyday \nin Britain. \n \nThe photograph is a social record of the fads of that time. The clothes, carpeted \nfloor, lush, green fertile surroundings also indicate wealth and prosperity. The \nbackdrop exists to ensure a statement about position and success is encompassed but \nalso to record a moment in a fixed way. The formality is deliberate. The family \nmembers do not show emotion: they are there to record their history and social \nconnections. This purpose has been played out in Kajal\u201fs relationship with the photo. \nHer own sadness is a reminder of her brother\u201fs distancing, but also of her own \nmarriage break-up. Her family has been broken and she has been failed by the \npromises of the perfect framing of families within this genre. The photograph is \nsymbolic of family networks and moral living, at the same time as being symbolic of \nBangladesh and the ecology of Bangladesh. Through gazing at the image she is \nreminded of her very real blood relations, which are superimposed with imaginary \nnarratives about nation, family and marriage. The image is symbolic and is a record of \n 24 \nan event; it captures a way of life in Bangladesh. In the group discussions, Kajal \ndescribes the summers of fear when tigers threatened villagers; she describes the \ndensity if the forests and the vulnerability of the village to heavy rainfall, leading to \nrisks in crop harvesting. She also describes the nature of the surrounding forest. The \npicture holds a relational importance to living in Britain. It links Kajal to Bangladesh \nand her past citizenship there. This relational identity is constantly affirmed in Britain \nin the processes of applying for state benefits and public housing, as a single parent, \nin all of these official documents she is asked to state her country of origin, and her \nfirst language, all of which link her to back to her Bangladeshi origins. \n \n5.3 African dioramas \n \nFig 3. Zebra by David Shepherd \n \nLike Sheetal, many of the women in the group had arrived in the U.K. from \nEast Africa. For some of them the visual cultures that they engage with resonate with \niconographical landscapes of the African Rift Valley and the animals classically \nrepresented within it. In the visual cultures of these women African animals such as \nthe Elephant, Lion, Cheetah and Zebra appear consistently. They are in living room \nclock faces, coasters, batiks, carvings and other curios. These images are engaged \nwith beyond the image represented. When talking through their value, many of the \ngroup describe the scents and smells and sounds of the jungle and the texture of the \nanimals skins. Here is a conversation inspired by the African image \n \n 25 \n\u201cWhere we used to go driving, we used to go through a kind of jungle. Where I am \nsaying was always a weird smell, before we entered the drive-in side.\u201d (Manjula) \n\u201cYou could hear the animals \u2026 because of the National Parks \u2026 and once a herd of \nelephants must have come out of the National Park and obviously you could hear ah \n\u2026 the noises.\u201d (Anju) \n\u201cThese people from Africa, as the fashion progresses, their stories will get wilder and \nwilder! \u201c(laughing) \u2026 (Shazia)   \n \nThis image is owned by Shanta. It is framed and placed centrally in the main \nfamily room. For Shanta, incorporated within this one image is a connection to her \nbiographical route to Britain, her first home in Kenya and her subsequent settlement \nin Malawi. Through gazing at the image Shanta describes the scents sounds and tastes \nof picnicking near Lake Naivasha in Kenya, seeing Zebra on the journey to Lake \nMalawi; for her the landscape of two nations conflate into a singular iconography of \nhypereal animals, jungle, flamingos, and the dry dusty savannah. Her family has \nseveral of these photographs by David Shepherd. David Shepherd is a wildlife artist \n(painting and portraiture) whose work started in Kenya. He is well known for his \nphotographs of the African savannah. Shepherd\u201fs images represent an iconography of \n\u201eAfrican\u201f landscapes and nature and he has contributed to a singular vision of African \nlandscape being about wild animals and native people, resonant of a colonial lens. \nDavid Shepherd has been an active environmentalist and holds an O.B.E. for his \nservices to wildlife conservation in Africa. He is also an honorary Fellow of the Royal \nGeographical Society. These images are hung up in the Shanta\u201fs living room, \nbedrooms and dinning room. They are placed there as fragments of East Africa \nreflecting into the home personal histories of East African living. The images  \n 26 \npresence an African aesthetic and incorporate the narratives of East African life into \nthe day-to-day living space through their aesthetics and imagery. There is a collaging \nof \u201eEnglish\u201f and \u201eAfrican\u201f aesthetics, lace, modern fittings, pastel walls, over laid with \nzebra, giraffe, and elephants from the savannah. These materials together reflect the \nvaried connections that Shanta and her family have with the landscape of East Africa \nas encountered in the London suburb of Harrow. The seeming incongruity reflects the \nmultiplicity of cultural connections that reflect Shantas\u201f migratory experiences, these \nresonate in her home reflecting her culture of being a post-colonial migrant settled \nwithin the leafy avenues of a suburban Pinner. \n \nMy positioning of these visual cultures as image-objects has been informed by \nan interest in the workings of visual texts beyond the frame. Writers within the field \nof visual culture, including Nicholas Mirzoeff (1998; 2000), argue for the \nacknowledgement of the material nature of visual texts. Photographic cultures \nresonate with aesthetics and textures of location. Temporal and spatial contexts of \ndisplay influence the location of the text. The multisensory nature of visual cultures is \ncrucial in their role in negotiating connections with landscapes within the frame in the \nsite of living in Britain. Understanding of these cultures in a post colonial context \ndraws on theorizations of hybridity (Bhabha, 1990), in-betweenness, and double-\nconsciousness (Du Bois, 1994). Each of these theorisations considers the post-colonial \nexperience as a cultural identity which is a non-located identity in flux. Shibani \ndescribes her identity positioning as \u201ebeing neither here nor there\u201f; neither Indian, \nKenyan, or English. Expressive cultures therefore are a means of interrogating this \npositioning of doubleness, or in-betweeness. Parkin (1999), describes this multiple \nsense of citizenry as multiple provenances where \u201c\u201ehome\u201f and \u201eorigin\u201f refer to many \n 27 \nplaces and not one fixed locus, perhaps similar to undeniably contestable and yet fluid \nboundaries of ethnicity and even nationality \u201d (p309) Gilroy\u201fs (1993a) term \n\u201eantiphony\u201f demonstrates how a social memory of sound resonates with a slave \nmemory of the African diaspora, an aural texture that triggers the historical past and a \nmeans of re-connecting to an oral history of oppression and subjugation. Here I would \nargue that visual cultures in the South Asian home reflect landscapes and they refract \na multisensory connection to the landscapes of East Africa and Asia which create a \ntextural landscape of belonging, home and are significant in their citizenship here. \n \n6. Textual, Textural and Material \nIn the examples so far, I have tried to show how the material elements of \nphotographs and images are as much part of their meaning as the texts within the \nframe. Often these are treasured because of the biographical journey that the image \nhas made, or the memories of landscapes which they refract. Sometimes the \nphotographs are locked in cupboards, sometimes secured within trunks within these \ncupboards - a sign of their irreplaceability. The images that they held did not always \nfit a classic iconography of \u201eother\u201f places. My next image exemplifies how the images \nincluded other genres and styles. This image shows how the women\u201fs engagements \nwith texts are triggered through a variety of textures and aesthetics. \n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Boy Fishing \n \n Here is an image entitled Boy Fishing. This was pointed out by Shilpa in a \ntour of her home. It is hung up in the entrance hall to her flat. It has pride of place \nwhere every visitor can see it. It\u201fs a surprising sugar sweet greeting-card image of a \n 28 \nrural idyll, a childhood idyll in fact, certainly aesthetically situated in a European or \nEnglish landscape. At the sight of this image Shipla is reminded of her uncle\u201fs home \nin Uganda, along the river. She describes the freshness of the scents, the rippling of \nthe river and the pleasure of being fee to roam in this landscape. She recalls the games \nthey used to play and how safe she felt in the area. For Shilpa this image is made \nmeaningful in her flat in Harlesden. It is positioned in Britain as a testament to the \nlandscape of dreamy childhood days in Uganda- of a luxurious home, a luscious \ncountryscape and the pleasure of free roaming. The aesthetics of the image are \nchocolate-box pastel, a saccharin ode to a fantasy of a sentimental picturesque scene, \nincongruously located in Uganda in Shilpa\u201fs narration. This image highlights the \nmeanings that material cultures have beyond their text as well as the nature of the \ncirculation of landscape meanings in colonial history. The image of an English \npastoral in this story is cross-cultural; it is translated as an aspiration toward a \npicturesque scene, which embodies pleasure, peace and a sense of innocent childhood \npastimes. However the image is a familiar one and in the tradition of landscape \nrepresentation, is not ideologically neutral (Bermingham, 1994). It embodies a vision \nof English landscape that is seemingly benign and nostalgic; the image re-iterates a \nculture of being based on a fantasy of nature and childhood. What it occludes is the \nsocial politics of the icon of a white playful child in England, a representation that is \nan impossibility for Shilpa\u201fs own child now living in England. Boy Fishing also \nevidences the power of the English pastoral in the South Asian imaginary, a legacy of \nliving within a British colonial state and culture prior to migration. \n  \nThe scene like many others displayed in homes accross Britain, is valued \npartially because it embodies a contrary scene to that of urban living, especially to the \n 29 \ninner London Borough of Brent where Shilpa is situated. It also becomes a respite \nfrom the struggles of resettling and bringing up a daughter single-handed after \nmigration. Shilpa compares her life at her uncle\u201fs in comparison with her difficulties \nof finding employment in the U.K. She has a BSc in Chemistry from Mumbai \nUniversity, but for the last two decades has been unemployed. In this context the \nimage holds more than a scene of Ugandan pastoral, it also harbours a landscape of \nhope beyond the struggle of isolation and alienation experienced in her day-to-day \nlife. Shilpa\u201fs visits to the women\u201fs centre are her sole source of access to a social \nnetwork. Her engagement with Boy Fishing also shows how refractions of \u201eother\u201f \nlandscapes are not always triggered through an exotic African palette. As viewers we \nimbue images with socially and culturally specific visual vocabulary; we make \nmeaning through our codes of reading, signifying and interpretation. The contexts of \ndisplay are also critical in activating these textual meanings. The Boy Fishing denotes \nan English pastoral that is folded into a series of narratives about the nature of \nEngland and a visual iconography of Englishness. The image initially seems \nincongruous and unexpected. After talking through its value and resonance with \nShilpa, it is clear that the text of the image is meaningful beyond the registers and \nvisual vocabulary of the genre. The material of the image can be read through \nShilpa\u201fs biography. The water in the image becomes equatorial: the grasses become \nsavannah. The scents and sounds shift from a European textural space to a Ugandan \none. In the context of Harlesden the matter of the image operates as a gateway into a \npast landscape of Uganda, but also into a social record of past landscape textures \nrelevant in their absence or non-attainability. Lived landscapes, utopian landscapes \nand England are juxtaposed on the surface of her flat wall. The entrance hall in the \nHarlesden flat is sometimes synchronised with the landscape in Uganda, but made \n 30 \nmeaningful in relation to being and living in Britain. Shilpa\u201fs narrative and embodied \nmemories are imbued in the matter of the poster; the poster becomes a third space \nwhere Uganda, and England merge through a process of refraction, and reflection. \n \nSheetal\u201fs Bismarck Rocks displayed in her home in Harrow also starkly \ncontrasts with the suburbanscape of public parks and semi-detached housing estates. \nThe intensity of attachment is triggered through the tension between being here in \nBritain and the intensity of attachment to a life in Tanzania, which cannot be \nreclaimed, as living in Mwanza is not a possibility. The texts ability to transmit those \ntextures into her home now, offers a form of suture. A piece of her very being is on \ndisplay, ensuring that Northwood is given meaning through the presence of Lake \nVictoria; not just the image but the scents, tastes, touch of African living. These \nrefractive textures from visual cultures on display combine to consolidate connections \nto other landscapes. Their new contexts of display give these cultures a new \u201ecultural \nvitality\u201f (Gell 1986: 86). They inject scents, sounds and textures of other landscapes \ninto the British home. Woven together these aesthetics represent a territory of culture, \na territory collated together which supports a sense of belonging and being which \nmakes sense of migratory journeying and telescopes these textures to create a place of \nsettlement and roots. To some degree these cultures contribute to the memorialisation \nof \u201eother\u201f people and places; they become artefacts of a biographical journey as well \nas a social history of the group. These visual markers are tokens, souvenir of another \ncountry, another landscape, which at the time of their lived experience was shaped by \nBritish colonial rule.  \n \n 31 \n7. Conclusions \nIn this research visual representations of landscape have been shown to be valuable \nmaterials in the South Asian home, beyond the framed text. These are experienced in \nthe everyday lived environments as essential nodes of connecting South Asian women \nto lived landscapes of the past, pre-migration. These visual representations of \nlandscape are considered in the everyday spaces of living rooms, bedrooms and \nhallways. This is a shift away from considering landscape representations in the more \nformal sites of display. I have demonstrated that the texts of these non-elite \nrepresentations, in the form of family photographs, prints and landscape photographs \nare meaningful beyond their textual representation. These visual cultures operate \nbeyond the mode of the visual, incorporating embodied memories of past landscapes \nand relationships with pre-migratory lives in colonial territories. The matter of their \nform shifts their value and meaning in their context of display, because of the social \nand cultural life that they refract. The refractive nature of visual cultures allows for \nembodied engagements with these materials \n \nFor the South Asian women represented here, an enfranchising culture of \ncitizenship is produced through collecting and displaying visual and material cultures. \nThey form part of a sense of heritage that is created through the procurement of \ndomestic objects, which are central to the sustenance of the self (Samuel 1994). These \ncollections of photographs and images constitute the new non-localised constructions \nof ethnic identity (Appadurai 1996). These cultures situated in the home-space offer a \nsense of inclusion, which has aesthetic, sensual, and psycho-sociological dimensions. \nThe landscapes refracted through these objects and texts of home embody the \ncomplex positioning of these women as being post-colonial migrants continually \n 32 \ntraversing \u201eBritish\u201f landscapes within and without Britain. They offer insights into \nwhat places are desired, safe and owned by this group which are points of \nenfranchisement, and through these cultures, ecological memories are woven into the \nwomen\u201fs residence in England. Through the incorporation of the materials of visual \ncultures in the South Asian home, the lived landscapes of the past assist the new \nconfigurations of identity in Britain.  Here I have argued for the need to read beyond \nthe visual representation of the text. A reading of visual cultures involves a \nconsideration of the way that these texts are lived-with, and act as prismatic devices, \nrefracting \u201eother\u201f landscapes into the British scene. They are active in their ability to \nlocate contemporary British Asian identity in context of post-colonial geographies of \nmigration. Their textural meanings and values add to their being operative in the \npolitics of making home and creating a new landscape of belonging, post-migration.  \n \nThis research has been an early step in evaluating and examining the \nmateriality of visual cultures as they are positioned in the South Asian home. There is \nhowever a need to take this further, to develop new conventions of textural \ninterpretation are is necessary in any materialist approach to visual cultures. The \nbiography, matter, and prismatic quialities of visual cultures open up occluded \ngeographies of identification, citizenship and cultures of living. I have positioned \nthese as post-colonial geographies, as these visual cultures refract landscape values \nconstituted within colonial regimes of rule in Asia and East Africa, and are valued by \nmigrants to the city which was at the heart of colonial rule \u2013 London. The identity \npositioning of post-colonial migrants such as South Asians is figured here within \ndomestic, everyday, vernacular structures of living. The form and textures that their \nvalued visual cultures refract offer additional dimensions to their mapping within \n 33 \nsocial and cultural geography. All of these cultures are valuable in locating post-\ncolonial geographies as they are figured through identification with environments and \nsocial lives not encountered within the formal or popular representations of South \nAsian life and culture in the public sphere. \n \nAcknowledgements \nI\u201fd like to thank Ben Anderson for his collaboration in running the Material \nGeographies conference in September 2002 and editing of this set of papers.
