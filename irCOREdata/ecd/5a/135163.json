BRITISH AIRWAYS: CULTURE AND STRUCTURE \n \nIrena Grugulis and Adrian Wilkinson \n \nToday,  nearly  twenty  years  after  the  publication  of  the  (in)famous  In  Search  of \nExcellence, the notion of \u201ecultural change\u201f within organisations continues to excite \nattention.  This continuing attraction is readily understood, since cultural interventions \noffer practitioners the hope of a universal panacea to organisational ills and academics \nan explanatory  framework that enjoys  the virtues  of being both  partially true and \ngloriously simple. Such a combination is apparent in the way that many attempts to \nshape organisational culture are presented to the public:  as simple stories with happy \nendings (see among others, Peters and Waterman, 1982; Peters and Austin, 1985; \nDeal and Kennedy, 1982; Pfeffer 1994, 1998). \n \nTo a certain extent, of course, any form of narration encourages a story, an ending, \nand, as a result, a simplification (Watson, 1999; Wray-Bliss, 2001) and stories may be \nused to shed light on attitudes and understandings not otherwise easily available to the \nresearcher (Gabriel, 1991; Watson, 2000). But there is a very significant difference \nbetween listening to the accounts that individuals tell in order to make sense of their \nlives and allowing the study of the workplace to become \u201efictionalised\u201f. The former \ninvolves engaging with the \u201esubjects\u201f of the research, attempting to understand their \nworld view and allowing them a voice in the process they are participating in. The \nlatter can mean a selective reading of the data with examples chosen because they \nillustrate pre-set conclusions. \n   2 \nIn  management  particularly  the  capacity  of  writers  to  turn  case  studies  into \ncelebratory fictions is worrying.  As Marchington (1995) argues, too many texts focus \non \u201cfairy tales and magic wands\u201d (see also Harvey-Jones, 1989: 1).  Such an emphasis \nencourages the belief that what is important in the workplace is not context, structure, \npower,  economics  or  industrial  relations  but  whatever  new  initiative  management \nhave chosen to introduce (the \"magic wands\"). The form that this magic takes varies \nfrom intervention to intervention but the impact claimed for each is curiously similar \nwith  unproductive workplaces  turned around and reluctant  employees  transformed \ninto enthusiasts. Any changes that take place are seen to be a direct result of the magic \nand most are exaggerated.  As a result, research into management becomes research \ninto a series of fads and fashions (Kieser, 1996) with Total Quality Management or \nBusiness  Process  Re-engineering  or  employee  involvement  or  culture  vying  for \nattention and every intervention presented as new. So academic understanding of the \nworkplace starts afresh each time a guru develops a new magic wand.  Lessons cannot \nbe carried forward since BPR is not employee involvement and company culture is \nnot TQM. Elements of the workplace that might have provided a crucial element of \ncontinuity are ignored or dismissed as unimportant since only change is magical.  As \na  result,  by  relying  on  these  accounts,  we  understand  less  and  less  about  why \norganisations function in the way that they do and practitioners are encouraged to \nbelieve that each initiative starts with a blank sheet, entirely unconstrained by what \nhas gone before. \n \nAccordingly, in this article we attempt to rescue a fairy-tale.  The story of British \nAirways is one of the most widely used inspirational accounts of changing culture \n(Heller,  1992).  Throughout  the  1980s  and  1990s  it  was  used  to  demonstrate  the   3 \nnecessary compatibility of pleasure and profits (see among many others, Georgiades \nand Macdonnell, 1998; Barsoux and Manzoni, 1997a, 1997b; Salama, 1994; Gabel, \n1994; Leahey and Kotter, 1990; Dana, 1998; Schneider and Bowen, 1995; Goldsmith \nand Clutterbuck, 1984).  In these, culture change is presented as the only explanation \nfor the transformation that occurred. This corrective makes no attempt to deny the \nvery substantial changes that took place in BA. Rather, it sets these in context noting \nthe  organisation\u201fs  environment  at  the  time  of  the  transformation,  the  structural \nchanges that took place and observing the impact that such changes had over the long \nterm (see also Blyton and Turnbull, 1998, Legge, 1994, 1995; Colling, 1995). \n \nManaging Culture: Promises and Problems \n \nIn many respects, managing culture is peculiarly susceptible to being presented as a \ncorporate  fiction.    While  other  management  initiatives  seek  to  promote  positive \nattitudes  by  increasing  employees\u201f  area  of  responsibility  through  empowerment \n(Wilkinson,  1998)  aligning  their  financial  interests  with  those  of  the  organisation \nthrough  adjustments  to  the  payment  system  (Kessler,  1995)  or  demonstrating  an \norganisational  commitment  to  its  \u201ehuman  assets\u201f  by  investing  in  training  (Keep, \n1989);  cultural  change  targets  employee  attitudes  directly  and  aims  to  secure \n\u201ecommitment\u201f rather than \u201eresigned behavioural compliance\u201f (Ogbonna, 1992\/1993) \nwith all employees sharing a \u201ecommon vision\u201f and working together for the good of \nthe organisation. \n \nAs a result, the managerial task becomes one that involves establishing control over \nthe  meaning  of  work,  rather  than  its  execution  (Mitchell,  1985),  of  \u201econverting\u201f   4 \nemployees to the corporate \u201efaith\u201f. In the words of Peters and Waterman (1982 p xxv) \nmanagers\u201f jobs become \u201cmore fun.  Instead of brain games in the sterile ivory tower, \nit's shaping values and reinforcing through coaching and evangelism in the field \u2013 \nwith the worker in support of the cherished product\u201d.  When the managerial task is to \ninspire  and  enthuse,  it  follows  that,  if  management  academics  are  management\u201fs \nadvocates  and  apologists  (cf.  Storey,  1985)  their  task  is  to  provide  prescriptions, \nexemplars and celebrations.  Such accounts exist to provoke an emotional response \nand provide a spur to action and, to fulfil these functions, must necessarily describe \nproductive interventions.  In this narrative tradition management fads and fashions \ncan only succeed. \n \nSo, not only is culture as a topic particularly likely to be represented as fiction, but \nalso management writers may see their role as essentially celebratory.  For those who \nread case studies to be inspired and enthused this combination is probably welcome.  \nOthers, who seek to understand the way organisations function; assess the impact of \ninterventions on employees; consider how structural and strategic factors combine; or \neven (through their writing) contribute towards a wider, emancipatory agenda; prefer \naccounts that do not automatically seek to report triumphs.  In these, the management \nof  culture  is  depicted  as  something  rather  more  complex  than  a  'magic  wand', \n\u201esuccesses\u201f  are  more  than  counter-balanced  by  initiatives  with  mixed  or  negative \nresults  and  interventions  are  not  assumed  to  be  permanent  'fixes'  (Kunda,  1992; \nGrugulis et al., 2000; Collinson, 1992; Storey, 1992; Hamper, 1992; Rosenthal et al, \n1997; Legge, 1994, 1995; Watson, 1994). \n   5 \nOccasionally the failures of culture management programmes are comic, Collinson \n(1992) argues that many of the initiatives designed by one British factory\u201fs (new, \nAmerican)  management  served  only  to  inspire  shop-floor  humour  including \nstigmatising the company newsletter as \u201eGoebel\u201fs Gazette\u201f.  Hamper\u201fs (1992) account \nof his time at General Motors included the story of the quality cat \u201ehowie makem\u201f \nwhose job was to patrol the factory exhorting workers to produce higher quality.  The \nGeneral Motors\u201f employees reacted to this by producing their own \u201equantity cat\u201f who \n(fittingly) chased \u201ehowie makem\u201f off the factory floor.  And British employees of the \nGap, a US-owned clothes chain, produced their own version of the organisation\u201fs \nmission statements (see Fig. 1):  \nThe Gap \nWords to live by \n \n \nEveryone counts \n \nEvery difference makes a difference \n \nOwn it, do it, done it \n \nLess is more . . . simplify \n \nTake the smart risk \n \nDo it better every day \n \nDo the right thing \nThe Gap \nWords to live by \nStaff Contributions in Italics \n \nEveryone counts the days until they leave \n \nEvery  difference  makes  a  difference \napart from indifference \n \nOwn it, do it, done it EH? \n \nOur wages Less is more . . . simplify \n \nTake the smart risk and quit \n \nDo it better every day and still feel shit \n \nDo the right thing and leave \nFig 1. The Gap, Words to Live By \nOther  accounts  of  cultural  interventions  are  less  amusing.    Keenoy  and  Anthony \n(1992) note that shortly after the TSB launched its culture change programme (which \naimed to construct an 'achievement orientated culture') it announced that some 5,000 \nstaff were to be made redundant; and Ogbonna and Wilkinson's (1988, 1990) research \ninto culture change in supermarkets describes practices that are very stressful for the   6 \ncheckout operators told to implement them.  In many organisations, it seems, cultural \ninterventions are simply a form of work intensification (Anthony, 1994; Wray, 2000).  \n \nSignificantly each of these references differs from the celebrations in their willingness \nto believe that culture\u201fs impact on employees is not automatically positive.  This is \nnot to argue that cultural interventions are never welcomed.  Kunda (1992), Casey \n(1995), Kidder (1981) and Grugulis et al. (2000) all describe environments in which \nenthusiastic  staff  welcomed  the  management  of  culture  (though  in  each  case  the \nimpact of this was problematic).  Watson\u201fs (1994) managers viewed ZCT\u201fs corporate \nculture changes with a mixture of hope and scepticism; and Storey (1992) notes that, \nwhile little sympathy was forthcoming from the shop floor, several line managers \nwere supportive. \n \nGoing  beyond  the  prescriptive  accounts  to  understand  organisations  also  raises \nquestions on the efficacy of culture in securing \u201ebottom line\u201f benefits.  This coaching, \nevangelism  and  conversion,  what  Reed  (1992,  p.  205)  describes  as  a  shift  from \n\u201ccontrol by repression to control by seduction\u201d is done because it is assumed that \nemployee commitment equates to higher profits.  In part because employees will now \ninvest their energy, enthusiasm and ideas without constraint (see, for example, Kunda, \n1992; Kidder, 1981; Grugulis et al, 2000); and in part because work is being re-\ndefined in emotional rather than productive terms (Hochschild, 1983; Fineman, 2000).  \nIn  practice,  of  course,  the  link  between  a  unitary  culture  and  corporate  profits  is \nelusive  (Legge,  1995).    Indeed,  not  only  is  the  failure  of  organisations  actively \nengaged in culture management and high commitment work practices notable, but \nalso anti-managerial cultures seem just as capable of fostering high levels of output as   7 \nmore  consensual  ones  (see,  for  example,  Burawoy,  1979;  Ackroyd  and  Crowdy, \n1990). \n \nThe British Airways Story \n \nEven  by  the  standards  of  modern  management  myths  the  British  Airways \ntransformation is impressive. At the end of the 1970s and the start of the 1980s BA \nwas performing disastrously against almost every indicator.  An old fleet made for \nuncomfortable  journeys  and  contributed  significantly  to  the  airline\u201fs  record  for \nunpunctuality (Corke, 1986); its productivity was considerably below that of its main \noverseas competitors (Warhurst, 1995); it was beset by industrial disputes; and it was \nrecording substantial financial losses (\u00a3140 million or some \u00a3200 a minute in 1981).  \nIt seemed that staff discontent was more than matched by customer disatisfaction and \nin 1980 a survey by the International Airline Passengers\u201f Association put BA at the \ntop of a list of airlines to be avoided at all costs (Blyton and Turnbull, 1998).  By \n1996 this picture was reversed.  Not only had BA become the world\u201fs most profitable \ncarrier, it was also voted the company that most graduates would like to work for \n(Financial Times 9\nth July 1997) and, by the year 2000, another survey declared it the \nsecond most admired company in Europe (Financial Times, 18th March 2000). \n \nMuch of the management literature attributes this turnaround to BA\u201fs own cultural \nchange which remodelled staff attitudes and set customer care as the primary focus of \nactivity  (see,  among  others,  Georgiades  and  Macdonnell,  1998;  Barsoux  and \nManzoni, 1997a; 1997b; Salama, 1994; Gabel, 1994; Leahey and Kotter, 1990).  As \nDoyle (1999 p. 20) noted:    8 \n \nIn the 80s  BA had been transformed from  a disastrous loss-making state \nenterprise - the British Rail of the sky - into the world's largest and most \nprofitable international airline.  It was a triumph for management, showing \nthat Britain could produce world-class companies that could beat the best of \nthe competition.  Its success was the result of the process and strategy that \nmanagement  introduced.    The  process  focused  on  creating  a  vision  that \nwould inspire the BA staff and gain their enthusiastic commitment. \n \nIt  is  certainly true that a great  deal  of effort  and energy went  into shaping  BA\u201fs \nculture.    At  the  heart  of  this  was  the  \u201ePutting  People  First\u201f  training  programme \nlaunched by Colin Marshall, the company\u201fs new chief executive, in December 1983.  \nOriginally intended for staff who had direct contact with customers it was, in fact, \nattended by all 40,000 employees by 1986 and it aimed to revolutionise their attitudes.  \nIn a direct challenge to the hierarchical and militaristic culture which existed in BA at \nthe time, staff were instructed not to attend in uniform and, once on the course, put \ninto  cross-functional  and  cross-grade  groups.    The  course  itself  was  consciously \ndesigned to modify behaviour.  Attendees were encouraged to take a more positive \nattitude to themselves, taught how to set personal goals and cope with stress and \ninstructed in confidence building and \u201egetting what they wanted out of life\u201f (Young, \n1989).  Lapel badges inscribed with the motto \"We're putting people first\" provided a \nvisible reminder of the course's message. \n \nThe approach was  self-conciously  \u201cindoctrinative\u201d (Bate, 1994 p  195).  As Colin \nMarshall said \"We . . . have to 'design' our people and their service attitude just as we   9 \ndesign an aircraft seat, an in-flight entertainment programme or an airport lounge to \nmeet the needs and preferences of our customers\" (cited in Barsoux and Manzoni, \n1997a p. 14 emphasis added). \n \nColin Marshall\u201fs own personal commitment is one of the most written-about features \nof the PPF programme.  He attended 95 per cent of all the PPF courses that ran, \nsetting out his vision for BA and participating in question and answer sessions with \nstaff (Georgiades and Macdonnell, 1998, though this figure is reported as 40 per cent \nin  Barsoux  and  Manzoni,  1997a).    This  involvement  extended  beyond  the  PPF \nprogramme. Each time he flew the chief executive would introduce himself to front \nline staff and passengers and discuss their experience of BA.  Once, when a queue \nformed at the launch of a new service he helped to deliver breakfasts to customers \n(H\u00f6pfl, 1993).  In his presence all of the symbols of the 'new culture' were expected to \nbe in place - even down to the PPF lapel badges.  Staff not wearing one of these had \nreplacements pinned in place and Colin Marshall wore his own PPF badge for two \nyears (Georgiades and Macdonnell, 1998 p 209). \n \nBut  the  most  impressive  aspect  of  BA\u201fs  cultural  change  is  not  so  much  the \nsophistication of the PPF programme itself, nor the commitment of executive time, \nbut the extent to which other employment policies and practices were changed to fit \nthe \u201enew\u201f culture and the continued emphasis on these practices  and programmes \nthroughout the 1980s and 1990s.  Three-quarters of the one hundred Customer First \nteams, formed to propagate the message of PPF, survived into the 1990s.  Not only \nwere  team  briefings  and  team  working  introduced  but  these  were  developed  and \nrefined with TQM, autonomous team working and multi-skilling introduced in many   10 \nareas.  Direct contact with all staff was considered so important that \u201edown route\u201f \nbriefings were developed to ensure that mobile and isolated staff were not neglected \nand in March 1996 BA became the first company to make daily TV broadcasts to its \nstaff (Colling, 1995). \n \nThe way cabin crew were rostered was also changed.  \u201eFamilies\u201f of staff were created \nto work the same shift patterns.  These were intended to provide mutual support, make \ncabin crew feel happier about their work environments and, as a result, facilitate the \nproduction  of  emotional  labour  (Barsoux  and  Manzoni,  1997a).    A  new  role  of \n\u201ePassenger Group Co-ordinator\u201f was introduced and staff appointed based entirely on \npersonal qualities.  The importance of emotional processes was also reflected in the \nnew appraisal and reward systems such that work was judged on the way in which it \nwas performed as well as against harder targets (Georgiades and Macdonnell, 1998; \nH\u00f6pfl, 1993).  Managerial bonuses could be as much as 20 per cent of salary and were \ncalculated  on  a  straight  50:50  split  between  exhibiting  desired  behaviours  and \nachieving quantitative goals.  Awards for Excellence and an Employee Brainwaves \nprogramme encouraged staff input.  The Personnel Department was renamed \u201eHuman \nResources\u201f with many decisions devolved to line managers and, in the first few years \nof the programme at least, a commitment was made to job security. \n \nClosely following these developments, a Managing People First programme targeted \nmanagerial  employees  and  aimed  to  bring  their  behaviours  into  line  with  a  list \ndeveloped by two consultancy firms (see fig. 2).  As on PPF, the emphasis on this \nfive-day  course  was  on  quasi-group  therapy  and  experiential  exercises.    Outward \nbound courses were also intended to support the re-shaping of personality and the   11 \nsmall groups formed on these residential programmes were expected to act as mutual \nsupport vehicles once back in the workplace. \n \nTHE MENU OF PRACTICES \nFACTOR I \nCLARITY AND HELPFULNESS \nFACTOR II \nPROMOTING ACHIEVEMENT \nEstablishing clear, specific objectives for \nsubordinates \nEmphasising  and  demonstrating \ncommitment to achieving goals \nHelping subordinates to understand how \ntheir  jobs  contribute  to  the  overall \nperformance of the organisation \nGiving  subordinates  feedback  on  how \nthey are doing \nClearly defining standards of excellence \nrequired for job performance \nCommunicating  your  views  to  others \nhonestly  and  directly  about  their \nperformance \nProviding help, training and guidance for \nsubordinates \nRecognising  people  more  often  than \ncriticising them \nGiving subordinates a clear-cut decision \nwhen they need one \nRecognising subordinates  for innovation \nand calculated risk taking \nFACTOR III \nINFLUENCING THROUGH \nPERSONAL EXCELLENCE AND \nTEAMWORKING \nFACTOR IV \nCARE AND TRUST \nKnowing  and  being  able  to  explain  to \nothers the mission of the organisation and \nhow it relates to their jobs \nBehaving  in  a  way  that  leads  others  to \ntrust you \nCommunicating  high  personal  standards \ninformally  through  appearance  and \ndedication \nBuilding warm, friendly relationships \nNoticing  and  showing  appreciation  for \nextra effort \nPaying close attention to what people are \nsaying \nSharing power in the interest of achieving \noverall organisation objectives \nResponding non-defensively when others \ndisagree with your views \nWilling  to  make  tough  decisions  in \nimplementing corporate strategy \nMaking  sure  that  there  is  a  frank  and \nopen exchange at work group meetings \nFig. 2  The four factor menu of practices used in British Airways in 1984 \u2013 1985 (Source:  Georgiades \nand Macdonnell, 1998 p 174). \n \nOther courses were developed to maintain the momentum created by Putting People \nFirst and Managing People First.  These included Winning for Customers, A Day in   12 \nthe Life, To Be the Best, Leading in a Service Business and Leadership 2000 and, \nwhile each was different, they all shared a focus on shaping staff emotions.  The most \ndramatic form of this was probably the \u201elove bath\u201f exercise in one of the early courses \nin which delegates took it in turns to sit in the centre of a circle while their colleagues \ncomplimented them (see H\u00f6pfl, 1993 for an account of participants\u201f reactions to this \nprocess).  Nearly twenty years after the launch of PPF, BA managers attending a \ntraining  course  were  still  being  told  about  understanding  themselves  and  taking \nresponsibility: \"understanding self is our starting point . . . .  That means that to make \na change within the airline we need to start with you - what can you do differently?\"  \n(BA  Training  Course,  Dangerous  Company,  BBC2  April  2000).    In  1995,  Bob \nAyling,  newly  taken  over  from  Colin  Marshall  as  chief  executive,  continued  this \nactive management of company culture and said of his staff: \"I want them to feel \ninspired, I want them to feel optimistic, I want them to feel that this is a good place to \nbe\" (Dangerous Company, BBC2 April 2000).  \n \nSuch substantive change certainly seems to justify the plaudits heaped on it.  But, as \nan account, it suffers from a number of flaws.  Most significantly, as Anthony (1994) \nnotes, together with other presentations of culture change it neglects structure.  Yet \nthe existence of cultural factors do not negate more material ones and there were \ncertainly structural reasons for BA\u201fs success. Colin Marshall\u201fs emphasis on putting \npeople first and caring for one another had been preceded by a rule of fear. BA\u201fs first \nresponse to its problems had been a massive series of redundancies, the largest in \nBritish history at the time, with staff numbers reduced by 40 per cent between 1981 \nand 1983 (albeit with generous severance).  Senior staff were not exempt from this   13 \nprocess, with 161 being \u201eremoved\u201f overnight on one memorable occasion in 1983 \n(Barsoux and Manzoni, 1997a).  \n \nMore  fundamentally,  the  company  was  well  provided  with  slots  in  Britain\u201fs \nprestigious Heathrow airport  and faced little competition on many of the routes that it \nserved.    European  markets  were  still  tightly  regulated  and  market  share  often \ndepended on negotiation skills rather than competitive success.  In 1987 just before \nprivatisation, BA controlled some 60 per cent of the UK domestic market and only \nexperienced competition on 9 per cent of routes into and out of the UK (Monopolies \nand  Mergers  Commission,  1987).    Post  privatisation  its  position  was  actually \nstrengthened when it gained a 75 per cent share of domestic routes (Colling, 1995). \nSuch was BA's dominance during this period that it could almost charge what it liked \n(The Economist, 18th March 2000).  Moreover, BA built up a series of alliances and \nmergers to consolidate this position (see Colling, 1995, for a full list). \n \nWhile staff numbers were being drastically cut the infrastructure was dramatically \nimproved.  The fact that new uniforms were provided is well covered in the human \nresource  and  marketing  literature.    Less  commonly  noted  is  that  BA  invested  in \ncontrol systems, terminal facilities and aircraft. Between 1980 and 1985 BA replaced \nover half their fleet (Colling, 1995).  Computer reservations were introduced; a series \nof hub and spoke routes through first Heathrow and then Gatwick networked flights; \nand selectively focused competitive pricing served to limit what little competition the \nairline faced (Blyton and Turnbull, 1996).  Nor was this the only strategy deployed \nagainst competitors.  In 1993 BA used shared booking information to persuade Virgin \ncustomers to transfer to BA, informing them (incorrectly) that Virgin flights were no   14 \nlonger available.  The subsequent court case fined BA \u00a3610,000 damages and \u00a33 \nmillion costs (Leake, 1998).  It raised questions about the extent of knowledge and \ninvovlement of Lord King, the chairman, Sir Colin Marshall, the chief executive and \nBob Ayling, the head of marketing (Lloyd, 1997; Kitson and Campbell, 1996) as well \nas criticising the impact of the BA culture itself (Financial Times, March 4\nth 1994). \n \nNot only can much of the BA turnaround be attributed to structural factors, but also \nthe extent of the company\u201fs cultural transformation itself is open to question.  There is \nlittle doubt that, in theory, cultural change interventions are both manipulative and \ntotalitarian  (Willmott,  1993)  seeking  as  they  do  influence  and  control  over  the \nthoughts,  values,  attitudes  and  norms  of  others.    Yet  such  hegemony  is  easier  to \ndescribe than it is to secure.  Employees are not cultural dupes (Hill, 1995; Keep, \n1989).    Co-operation  may  reflect  ambition  or  pride  in  work  (Storey,  1992; \nKorczynski, 2001) as much as (or instead of) a belief in the organisation itself.  And \nH\u00f6pfl\u201fs  (1993)  account  of  British  Airways  managers  in  the  \u201enew\u201f  culture  reveals \nhostility and uncertainty as well as enthusiasm.  Further, despite the claims of the \nprescriptive literature, the existence of 'culture management' does not ensure either \nthat employees trust management, or that management trusts employees. So, in BA, \n\u201enew\u201f  management  practices  varied  in  the  extent  that  they  were  introduced  in \ndepartments (Salama, 1994) and conflict between employees and management did not \ncease.  Even at the point at which the company's unified culture was being heralded as \na success at least one bargaining group a year ended up in dispute with it (Colling, \n1995). \n   15 \nNor  was  the  much  vaunted  job  security  quite  as  robust  as  it  seemed.    Alliances, \nmergers and franchising agreements with other airlines already supported what was, \nin effect a 'tiered' system of terms and conditions with employees based at Heathrow \nprivileged over those in the regional airports (Colling, 1995).  This emphasis on part-\ntime,  seasonal  and  sub-contracted  work  was  extended  to  most  aspects  of  BA's \noperations.  Its engine overhaul plant was sold off to GEC; data processing work was \nmoved to Bombay; and job security for existing staff questioned (Warhurst, 1995; \nBlyton and Turnbull, 1996; Colling, 1995).  And all this at a time when BA was \nmaking record profits. \n \nSo, to re-cast our fairy-tale in rather more prosaic terms, BA, while clearly putting a \ngreat deal of effort into encouraging certain behaviours from (or \u201edesigning\u201f) staff did \nnot base its employment policies and practices around the new culture in the way that \nmany accounts suggest.  Their array of 'soft' human resource management techniques \nwas certainly impressive but not everyone benefitted from them and those employed \nin  partner,  assoicate,  merged  or  taken-over  firms  often  experienced  very  different \nterms and condidtions to the 'core' BA staff. \n \nNor is it fair to conclude, as many accounts do, with optimism about staff reactions to \n'culture change'.  There was enthusiasm and acceptance certainly, but there was also \ndoubt,  concern,  opposition  and  open  cynicism  (H\u00f6pfl,  1993).    Such  indiviudal \nreactions  were  mirrored  by  the  collective    representations  and  the  persistence  of \ndisputes even at the height of the cultural success.  As Colling (1995 p 25) argues \n\u201cThe relatively high incidence of conflict throughout the period fuels doubts about a \ntransformation in the culture of the company towards the mutual commitment model\".     16 \n \nThe 1997 Dispute: Change or Continuity? \n \nBy the end of the 1990s many of the structural factors that had provided the basis for \nthe company\u201fs success were under threat. The emergence of low cost carriers such as \nEasyjet and Ryanair were undercutting BA\u201fs prices and, elsewhere, alliances between \nrivals Lufthansa and United Airlines ensured that cross national traffic would be less \nlikely to transfer to BA.  The company\u201fs hold on Heathrow was also loosening under \ndouble pressure from Europe and the USA.  In response, Ayling claimed BA needed a \nsecond revolution.  BA sought its own alliance with a different US carrier, American \nAirlines which came under the (unhurried) scrutiny of regulators in both Brussels and \nthe USA, as well as proposing \u00a31 billion of cost savings from within the organisation, \nwith the aim of doubling profits by the year 2000.  Much of this was to come from \nstaff  savings  including  5,000  voluntary  redundancies  with  staff  to  be  replaced  by \nnewly hired employees on lower pay (Blyton and Turnbull, 1998).  In addition, BA \nestablished links with a charter airline called Flying Colours intending to continue its \npolicy of outsourcing to other operators. \n \nThis policy of reducing labour costs was also extended to 'core' BA staff.  In early \n1997,  BA  attempted  to  change  the  structure  of  payments  to  cabin  crew.  It  was \nproposed  that  the  existing  employees  would  be  \u201ebought  out\u201f  of  their  series  of \nallowances (petrol, overnight stay etc) by receiving a higher basic wage.  BA offered \na three year guarantee that no crew member would earn less under the new system but \nnothing  beyond  that  and  it  was  clear  to  cabin  crew  staff  that  the  measure  was \nlaunched with the explicit aim of saving money.  When these negotiations failed, one   17 \nunion, the TGWU, threatened strike action (Cabin Crew 89, a small breakaway union, \nhad already accepted management\u201fs offer).  Despite fourteen years of \u201eindoctrination\u201f \ninto caring for one another and putting people first, the tactics deployed by BA\u201fs \nmanagement  were  described  by  two  such  different  sources  as  the  TUC  and  The \nEconomist as bullying (Taylor, 1998; The Economist 27\nth July 1997).  Members of the \ncabin  crew  were  warned  not  to  strike  and  BA  managers  were  instructed  to  tell \ndiscontented staff that anyone taking industrial action would be summarily sacked, \nthen sued for damages.  Any who simply stayed away would face disciplinary action, \nbe denied promotion, and lose both pension rights and staff discounts on flights for \nthree years.  BA were also reported to be filming pickets. \n \nThe subsequent strike ballot had an 80 per cent turnout with 73 per cent of employees \nvoting in favour of strike action. The TGWU called a series of 72-hour strikes with \nthe first action scheduled for 9th July 1997.  In response, temporary staff and an \nalternative workforce of \u201evolunteer managers\u201f were  given a (probably inadequate) \ntraining to perform the key tasks of the ground handling staff (The Herald 26\nth June \n1997) and BA threatened to take legal action over claimed discrepancies in the ballot.  \nOn the eve of the first day of action airline cabin crew were telephoned at home and \nwarned that 'they had a duty to co-operate with their employer' (The Times, 8\nth July \n1997). \n \nThese managerial actions certainly influenced the impact of the strike.  On the first \nscheduled  day  of  action  less  than  three  hundred  workers  declared  themselves \nofficially on strike but more than 2,000 called in sick.  The company\u201fs threats and \n\u201ereplacement  workers\u201f  notwithstanding  more  than  70  per  cent  of  flights  from   18 \nHeathrow  were  cancelled  (The  Economist  12\nth  July  1997).    It  seemed  that  BA\u201fs \nmacho approach had ensured only that collective action took the form of collective \nillness. \n \nIronically this 'mass sickie' served to make things worse for BA.  Not only did the pre-\nstrike  ballots  (conducted  to  comply  with  legislation  designed  to  discourage  union \nactivities) compound the effects of the strike by providing customers with advance \nnotice of it; but also those employees who had called in sick tended to stay away \nlonger than the official 72-hour strike.  BA insisted that sick employees provide a \ndoctor\u201fs note within 48 hours instead of the normal seven days but many employees \nstill stayed off for the full two weeks that their sick notes allowed and, throughout this \nperiod, services were cancelled and passengers turned away (Gribben, 1997).  The \nstrike was costly.  Airline seats are a particularly perishable form of consumer good \nand aircraft scheduling is easily disrupted.  When Bill Morris, the General Secretary \nof the TGWU announced that he had written to Bob Ayling, suggesting that they \nresume negotiations, Ayling agreed before even receiving the letter. \n \nThe TGWU promised to save \u00a342 million over three years.  Catering was sold off but \nexisting staff kept earnings and BA staff discounts, while sanctions against strikers \nwere withdrawn and the TGWU increased its membership by 50 per cent to over \n10,000.    BA's  management  fared  less  well,  despite  Bob  Ayling's  claim  that  this \nagreement marked a 'new beginning and spirit of a cooperation' (The Guardian 13\nth \nSeptember 1999).  The gulf between the managerial rhetoric on culture and official \nactions  during  the  strike  had  a  predictable  effect  on  employee  morale.    One \nundercover employee publication, aptly named Chaos advised on ways of maximising   19 \npayments  by  delaying  aircraft.    These  included  throwing  duvet  feathers  into  the \nengine,  superglueing  down  the  toilet  seat  and  poisoning  the  pilot:  \u201ca  particularly \nobnoxious captain can be made to suffer all the symptoms of violent food poisoning \nby emptying eye drops from the aircraft medical kit into his salad or drink\u201d (The \nGuardian, 8\nth November 1997). \n \nMoreover, the agreement itself fostered further dissent.  4,000 staff left by the end of \n1997 but 4,500 more were recruited including 2,000 in 1998.  By the terms of the \nagreement,  these  new  staff  were  employed  on  different  contracts  to  existing \nemployees.  As a result, cabin crew working the same shifts on the same aircraft were \n(increasingly) on different payscales.  The impact of this on both labour relations and \nBA\u201fs  much  prized  teamworking  was  problematic  and  problems  were  fuelled  by \nsuggestions that staff on new contracts were favoured by BA in promotion to purser \n(first line manager). \n \nBob Ayling attempted to salvage the situation by placing more emphasis on managing \nthe company\u201fs culture.  Following Colin Marshall he addressed staff training sessions \nand held question and answer forums with groups of employees.  This time there were \nfew  positive  reactions.    The  strike  cost  BA  \u00a3125  million;  morale  never  entirely \nrecovered (Dove, 2000); and profits suffered.  Between 1998 and 1999 they fell by 61 \nper cent and in 2000 British Airways announced losses of \u00a3244 million on its main \nbusiness.  While gains from disposals succeeded in keeping the company out of the \nred this was its worst performance (and first loss) since privatisation.  The new logo \nBob Ayling had launched (at great expense) during the 1997 dispute was unpopular \nand had to be withdrawn.  These failures so coloured the public perception of the   20 \nchief  executive  that  even  his  attempts  to  refocus  BA  onto  profitable  routes  and \nintroduce  a  new  seat  for  business  class  long  haul  passengers  were  not  entirely \nwelcomed.  On March 10\nth 2000, Bob Ayling resigned as chief executive. \n \nConclusions and Discussion \n \nRe-presenting our fairy story in case study format shows the company\u201fs turnaround in \na different light with international agreements, competition with other airlines, the \nstate of the fleet and the network of links between flights making a contribution to \nimproved  performance  that  was  as  least  as  siginficant  as  the  cultural  change \nprogramme itself.  It is difficult to believe that, without these structural interventions \nBA's profits would have risen in the way that they did (cf. Peters and Waterman, \n1982).  Equally, the structural improvements may have served to enhance the cultural \nmessages  just  as  Bob  Ayling's  \"Chicago-style  union  busting  macho  management\" \n(George Galloway, MP Newsnight 10\nth July 1997) made his seem hypocritical.  As \nGrugulis et al. (2000) argue in their study of a consultancy firm, it is na\u00efve to assume \nthat  practices  which  are  effective  when  companies  are  successful  will  be  equally \nwelcome at other times.  Employees do not 'react' to the management of culture in \nisolation, nor does a 'positive' cultural rhetoric negate problematic experiences of job \ndesign,  dis-empowerment,  payment  systems  or  control  mechanisms.    Rather, \nresponses  will  be  influenced  by  a  person's  experience  of  work  as  a  whole  and \nemployees  are  more  than  capable  of  noting  discrepancies  between  managerial \npromises and organisational practice. \n   21 \nThis is not to suggest that BA's cultural change was unimportant.  Indeed, the move to \n\u201edesign\u201f employees, to shape the way they think and feel about their work rather than \nsimply control what they produce is a new development (Edwards, 1995; Willmott, \n1993; Kunda, 1992 among others provide a consideration of its implications; but see \nalso  Dalton,  1966;  Barnard,  1962;  Kanter,  1977  for  an  account  of  the  loyalties \nexpected  of  managerial  employees).    A  growing  service  sector  and  an  increasing \nfocus on customer service in all industries has resulted in an emphasis on the service \nprocess (of which the employee is an integral part) rather than a manufactured product \n(see du Gay, 1996; Sturdy, 2001; Nickson et al., 2001).  Clearly such a development \nhas  and will lead to  fundamental  changes  in  the way  work is  shaped.  But  these \nchanges are not attempts to make work \"more fun\".  They represent a new means of \nmanagement control (Reed, 1992) targeted on staff emotions.  So personalities and \nindividuals are valued only within pre-determined limits (Bate, 1994). \n \nEmployers these days may take the line that they wish employees to express \nthemselves and explore their potential, but actually they are interested in this \nsort  of  capacity  only  in  so  far  as  it  is  conducive  to  the  benefit  of  the \norganisation.  They tend to have preconceived ideas about how much and \nwhat kind of individuality is needed.  They do not, in fact, wish to find too \nmuch  variation  from  their  ideas  in  this  area;  nor  do  they  want  dissent \nconcerning their favoured policies.  Despite an apparent openness, therefore, \nthere are things employers are definitely unwilling to countenance or indeed \nlisten to. (Ackroyd and Thompson, 1999 p102). \n   22 \nHere, BA's programme of culture change was not an expression of mutual trust and \nreciprocal  emotional  obligations  between  the  company's  employees  and  its \nmanagement.    Rather,  it  was  an  alternative  control  mechanism  and  should  be \nunderstood as such.  The way that this control mechanism is implemented and the \nconsequences that it has differ from other forms of personal, technical or bureaucratic \ncontrol; but management by culture is not automatically either better or worse than \nother forms of regulation and may inspire varied responses.  Employees may feel \ngenuine pride in a culture management programme (Kunda, 1992; Grugulis et al., \n2000) or may desire to use it towards their own ends (Storey, 1992).  Equally they \nmay feel embarrassment (H\u00f6pfl, 1993) or cynicism (Collinson, 1992); set up active \nopposition (Ackroyd and Crowdy, 1990) or use the culture change as a vehicle for \nmisbehaviour (Ackroyd and Thompson, 1999) and structural factors may influence \nand inform these responses.  The 'successes' and 'failures' of these interventions are \nnot magical, nor do they occur in environments that have no legacy of employee \nrelations.  But this point is clearest when case studies are extended beyond anecdote \nand prescription, a development which might encourage better practitioners as well as \nbetter academics. \n \nREFERENCES \nAckroyd, S. and Thompson, P.
