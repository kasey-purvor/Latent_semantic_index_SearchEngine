Having entered British public discourse perhaps as early as 2002, \n\u2018chav\u2019 has rapidly become the \u201cnew terminology in which socially marginal groups \nare characterized, classified and understood\u201d (Hayward and Yar, 2006: 10), replacing \n 2 \npredecessors like \u2018underclass\u2019. But whereas the underclass, during the 1990s \nespecially, were understood to be those members of the working class who \nconsistently failed to participate in paid employment (ie, in production), chavs are \nmore usually defined by virtue of their supposedly debased consumption activities. \nArguably the most salient characteristic of chavs, then, at least as they are constructed \nand produced through popular cultural accounts, is these distinctive consumption \nhabits. Chavs are imagined as young working-class men and women, usually white, \nwith a taste for particular kinds of sportswear, branded goods and ostentatious \ndiamond and gold jewellery, whose vernacular mixes R&B slang with text message \ncode.  \n \nBut despite the fact that \u2018chav\u2019 is usually a pejorative, Fraser (2005) identifies a \npreoccupation with the male chav on the British gay scene \u2013 a growing appetite \namongst gay men for seemingly downwardly mobile sexual experiences \u2013 which he \nlabels \u2018chavinism\u2019. Chavinism takes several commodity forms, including gay men \nbuying clothes in order to dress as chavs, listening to or watching recordings of chavs \nhaving sex (eg, by downloading onto a mobile phone) or even seeking \u2018real\u2019 sex with \ntracksuit-wearing, baseball-cap-sporting youths (eg, by going to \u2018chav nights\u2019 at gay \nclubs, in cities such as London, Manchester and Brighton). Thus chavs, themselves \ndepicted in popular discourse as avid, brand-aware consumers, have apparently \nbecome commodities for others\u2019 consumption; in this case, gay men who supposedly \nhail from the middle classes. It is this translation of a particular kind of sexual \nfascination into commodity form which constitutes our object of inquiry.  \n \n 3 \nOur analysis leads us to pose a number of interrelated questions. In the context of the \ngay male populationi, what can chavinism tell us about how commodity relations \nmediate the politics of sexuality? How might the class dynamics of chavinism \n(re)structure the possibilities of homosexual experience, as currently delimited by \n\u2018hegemonic homosexuality\u2019? How might it impact upon relations between the \ndifferent class fractions amongst British gay men? To what extent should chavinism \nbe considered a harmless postmodern game of dressing upii\n \n, just another new style for \ngay men? Or is this postmodernist take on consumer identity both na\u00efve and complicit \nin the continuing reproduction of material and symbolic inequalities within the gay \npopulation?  \nCrucially, we are preceded here by Paul Johnson\u2019s (2008) fascinating piece in this \njournal, where he argues very much in the latter vein. Johnson suggests gay \nchavinism\u2019s \n \n\u2018most pernicious aspect \u2026 is that while the male chav has value in one \ncontext, value created by his use as a sexual object, such value is based on a \ncontinual assertion of his worthlessness. The chav remains an object - before, \nduring and after his use \u2013 of disgust, filth and repudiation.\u2019 (p. 79)  \n \nThus, for Johnson, the representations on which chavinism turns generate a kind of \nsymbolic violence which reproduces the existing socio-economic hierarchy \u2013 the \nmiddle-class \u2018haves\u2019 over the working-class \u2018have nots\u2019. We are sympathetic to many \nof his conclusions. However, for us it is impossible to answer any of the questions we \npose above once and for all, given that any decision about the politics of anything \n 4 \ndepends on audience, context and timing, and no cultural complex is progressive or \nreactionary in its entirety. Culture is saturated with politics, and chavinism is an \nirremediably political set of practices. But its precise import in any given location is \nextremely difficult to define; and we see more, potentially, to chavinism than Johnson \nsets out. Here we try to raise some of the wider issues we think are pertinent to \nunderstanding this phenomenon as a form of consumption, in part through a \nconversation with Johnson, in order to lay the conceptual foundations for future \nempirical work.  \n \nIndeed the analysis Johnson provides, based on the representations used to sell chav \ncommodities to gay men, would we believe be usefully supplemented by discussion \nof what he describes as \u2018the subjective experiences of how or why people might \nidentify as chavs or use chav culture\u2019 (2008, p. 67). Relatedly, and as opposed to \nJohnson\u2019s unpicking of the relationships between representations of class identity and \nsocial control, our discussion belongs within the domain of consumption studies. As it \nstands, the literature on marketing to and consumption by the gay population \noverwhelmingly portrays the Western male homosexual consumer as \u2018hyper-mobile, \naffluent and privileged\u2019 (Binnie and Skeggs, 2004, p. 44). As such it perpetuates the \nmyth of an undifferentiated gay \u2018community\u2019 and positions an a priori gay consumer \nculture in supplementary relation to its heteronormative counterpart. For us this \ncommentary typically reduces gay consumer behaviour to a set of unproblematic \ncultural and aesthetic knowledges and practices. Analysis of the \u2018gay chav\u2019 as a \nconsumption object is interesting not least because it has the potential to undercut \nthese hegemonic constructions of gay men as consumers.  \n \n 5 \nWe also view gay chavinism as a contemporary example of the enduring activity of \ncross-class sex associated with the development of capitalism and the re-enactment of \ndiscursive \u2018bourgeois projections of proletarian excess and failures of bodily control\u2019 \n(Henderson, 2007, p. 201). So in some ways, as Johnson (2008, pp. 69-70) points out, \ngay chavinism is nothing new in its \u2018homoeroticization of working-class subjects\u2019: it \nis the 21st century equivalent of older constructs like \u2018rough trade\u2019iii\n \n. However what is \nnew, we argue, is chavinism\u2019s commodification of same-sex desire via a particular \narticulation of working-class identity and the mapping of that desire in public culture \nin highly visible and organized ways, including the aforementioned club nights and \nphone lines. Gay chavinism is therefore an instance of \u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1997) \nmulticulturalism; of contemporary capital\u2019s appropriation of ethnic difference (which \nhe defines as any form of \u2018otherness\u2019) in order to generate surplus value. \nThe above established, Part 1 of this paper  discusses the relationship between \nsexuality, consumption and class. We then present a bipartite analysis of the gay chav. \nPart 2 foregrounds social class as an analytic lens on gay chavinism, and Part 3 layers \nthis account with the interconnected categories of gender and sexuality around which \narticulations of gay male identity are likewise organized. Here we speculate on \nchavinism\u2019s equivocal potential in regard to relations within and beyond the gay male \npopulation. Our discussion presents a theoretical framing of a particular spatial and \ntemporal commodification of the class\/sexuality nexus for future empirical \nexploration.  \n \n 6 \nPART 1: SEXUALITY, CONSUMPTION AND CLASS \n \n\u2018Knowing\u2019 the gay male consumer \n \nDriven primarily by economic concerns with gay male consumers as a \u2018new\u2019 and \npotentially lucrative market segment, Western marketing professionals have invested \na great deal since the early 1990s in trying to capture the \u2018gay market\u2019 (DeLozier and \nRodrigue, 1996; Fugate, 1993; Oakenfull and Greenlee, 2005). The fabrication of this \nmarket niche has in turn attracted the attention of a diverse academic audience. \nQualitative consumer researchers, for instance, have sought to differentiate \u2018gay\u2019 \nconsumption from its \u2018straight\u2019 counterpart. Conceptualizing the former as \nsubcultural, this scholarship identifies the values, practices, self-images and feelings \nthat gay meniv\n \n apparently share, and the role of brands and other facets of consumer \nculture in their reproduction. Consumption is seen to play an integral role in the \ncoming-out experiences of many gay men, and in subsequent processes of \nsocialization into the gay scene, such that these consumption rituals are said in part to \ncreate their sexual identities (Freitas et al., 1996; Haslop et al., 1998; Kates, 2002, \n2003, 2004; Keating and McLoughlin, 2005; Klawitter, 2002).  \nThis literature frames the typical gay male consumer as affluent, savvy, quick to adopt \nnew commodities and brand-aware. It develops what has become known as the \u2018pink \npound thesis\u2019, which seems to be based on an essentializing view of an integrated gay \nconsuming self expressing its \u2018fundamental\u2019 needs through the marketplace. Such \nstudies also emphasize the importance of the visual domain of consumption - dress, \nspeech, fashion and style, bodily rituals and habits - in signifying in-group \n 7 \nmembership amongst gay men and a separation from mainstream culture (Freitas et \nal., 1996; Rudd, 1996). Given the long history of oppression and invisibility \nexperienced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) population, \nstylizing oneself as gay is read here as more than a concern for aesthetics. In other \nwords, activities aimed at celebrating publicly same-sex desire are interpreted as a \npolitical tactic to disrupt the heteronormativity of everyday societal institutions.  \n \nAlthough we agree that consumption plays a vital role in the production of gay \nidentities, care should be exercised in the interpretation of visibility as it relates to \nsexuality (Author B, 2007). As Foucault (1979) famously argues, visibility of any \nsexuality in modernity is made possible by the discourses which define and regulate \nits legitimate boundaries. The discursive incitement to sex represents a will to \nknowledge among social actors which, despite claiming to reveal the truth of sex in \nall its diversity, most often serves to marginalize a range of sexualities in sometimes \nvery subtle ways. Sexual \u2018experts\u2019, marketers and academics included, therefore have \nthe power to enable and constrain particular expressions and experiences of sexuality. \nWe will suggest that the \u2018pink pound thesis\u2019 is a key exemplar of this process because \nit fashions what we call \u2018hegemonic homosexuality\u2019. But first we elaborate on the \nrelationship between class and consumption, to demonstrate that gay male \nconsumption as understood within this thesis fundamentally relies on class \ndistinctions. \n \n 8 \nConnecting class and consumption \n \nFollowing Bourdieu (1984), we understand social class as structural and symbolic, as \nan objective material reality, affecting access to valued social resources, as well as a \nsubjective identity. As such these two aspects of class cannot be meaningfully \nseparated. Bourdieu identifies class as an arbitrarily imposed definition with real \nsocial effects, so that our socialization in a particular socio-economic location shapes \nnot only our values but also the composition and volume of capital we possess; \neconomic (income, wealth, inheritance), social (connections with others and group \nmemberships) and cultural (physical dispositions and skills, educational \nqualifications). The various instantiations of these capitals are more or less valuable \ndepending on the context\/s we inhabit and move between. Our social location also \ninfluences these movements, and hence our ability to capitalize on the \u2018assets\u2019 we \nalready have. Class is therefore a form of economic and cultural structuration, \nreproduced in the intellectual, physical and emotional dispositions of a consumer\u2019s \n\u2018habitus\u2019 (also see Johnson, 2008, p. 71).  \n \nFor Bourdieu (and many others), consumption has always been an important \nmanifestation of social stratification, and of actual and aspired movement up and \ndown the social ladder. Chavinism can be conceptually accommodated here in the \nfollowing ways. First, it arguably makes visible the socially stratified nature of the \ngay population: thus it is a class issue. Chavinism works with the structural and \nsymbolic inequalities shaping relations between different strata of the gay population. \nFurther, it potentially articulates middle-class concerns to expand (sexual) \ndispositions in the process of constructing and commodifying working-class male \n 9 \nsexuality. Second, chavinism exemplifies a desire for downward class mobility, \nhowever temporarily. Third, although class and consumption are well-trodden \nconceptual terrain, the intersection(s) of sexuality with class is much less well studied \n- although equally complex.  \n \nQueering class and classing queer \n \nThe \u2018pink pound thesis\u2019 as elucidated above typically constructs gay male consumers \nas well-off, discerning, fashion-conscious early adopters, a portrayal which is \nproduced and reproduced within heterosexual and homosexual populations alike. For \nexample, Sender (2001) demonstrates how Advocate magazine, targeted at gay \nconsumers, has systematically created its ideal-type reader based on the construction \nof a \u2018dominant gay habitus\u2019 for an \u2018openly gay, professional-managerial class\u2019 (p. 73). \nExtending Connell\u2019s concept of hegemonic masculinity, we suggest that this \nprototype has become hegemonic; that it is an \u2018admired\u2019 model of homosexual \n\u2018conduct\u2019, embodying \u2018the currently most honoured way of being\u2019 a homosexual man \n(Connell, 2002, p. 90; Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 832).   \n \nAs such, this hegemonic homosexuality relies upon \u2018[c]ultural consent, discursive \ncentrality, institutionalization, and the marginalization or delegitimation of \nalternatives\u2019 (Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 846). It (re)creates a particular \nsocial hierarchy amongst homosexual men. This hegemony is also \u2018historically \nconcrete\u2019 (Connell, 2002, p. 89), specific to the contemporary consumerist West, and \nsubject to contestation and change. Relatedly and importantly, it is only one amongst \nmany potential homosexualities currently in existence.  \n 10 \n \nGay male consumption from such a vantage point also appears to epitomize \u2018first \nworld\u2019 citizenship and productive \u2018middle classness\u2019. As Taylor adds, though, any \nsuch acceptance of homosexuality by the heteronormative mainstream is both uneasy \nand fragile \u2013 such that \u2018respectful, consuming citizens \u2026 can be \u201cjust like you\u201d; if not \nheterosexual then definitely middle-class\u2019 (2005a, p. 485). Hegemonic homosexuality \noccludes the fact that gay men are just that \u2013 homosexual. It \u2018cleanses\u2019 the gay male \nidentity of sexuality, pointing instead to their supposedly particular aesthetic, their \nprofessional occupations and their accomplished, urbane \u2018knowingness\u2019. Straight \nsociety is, we assume, able to \u2018handle\u2019 this version of homosexuality because it means \nthat there is no direct confrontation with sexuality. Its more positive characteristics \nnotwithstanding, then, such as the degree of affirmation and social freedom it \npotentially confers on gay men (see for example Pe\u0144aloza, 1996), hegemonic \nhomosexuality can simultaneously be understood as homophobic (Connell, 1992, p. \n748; Binnie and Skeggs, 2004, p. 44).  \n \nInevitably these hegemonic, abstract depictions also neglect socio-economic \nvariations amongst gay men (Skeggs, 1999, p. 215, following Warner and Whittle).  \nThey hinge on the assumption that a bourgeois aesthetic is shared by and equally \naccessible to all gay men, gliding over social stratification in the gay population. \nAlthough Taylor (2005a, p. 488, following Brickell and Evans) correctly points out \nthat gay men may be more \u2018assimilable\u2019 within contemporary capitalist society than \nlesbians because their gender provides easier recourse to the wherewithal to pursue an \n\u2018appropriate\u2019 lifestyle, Badgett (1997), for one, provides compelling evidence that \ntheir purported universally affluent status is a myth. US statistics portraying gay men \n 11 \nas wealthy are, she suggests, based on survey data collected from samples of high \nincome, highly educated gay people only - certainly not the whole population. So \nhegemonic homosexuality is \u2018not assumed to be normal in the statistical sense\u2019 \n(Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 832 \u2013 emphasis added): instead it establishes a \nseries of ideals or aspirations for gay men as a social group.  \n \nThis argument suggests that homosexuality is \u2018acceptable\u2019 in the wider cultural terrain \nonly under highly circumscribed conditions, which raises questions about any pursuit \nof equality for the LGBT population through the market. Indeed some commentators \ninsist the market necessarily appropriates and thus neutralizes any oppositional ethos \nin gay and lesbian social movements. As such Chasin (2000) describes the celebration \nof \u2018gay success\u2019 in marketing as a form of selling out. Ingebretsen (1999, p. 125) goes \nfurther to claim that gay people, like other historically oppressed groups such as Jews, \nare increasingly linked with money in ways which superficially signal social \nacceptance. But he warns these links also pacify gay political agency, reduce same-\nsex desire to a palatable form of commodified transgression and foster economic \nparanoia amongst socially dominant groups, thus perpetuating homophobia. Thus \n\u2018Accommodation, like membership, has its privileges, but it exacts its prices as well\u2019 \n(Ingebretsen, 1999, p. 135). Understood as a form of class transvestism, such \nambivalence might also be associated with chavinism.  \n \nClass transvestism  \n \nAs Butler\u2019s (1999) seminal analysis of drag implies, it is important not to exaggerate \nthe seditious properties of any form of transvestism. She concludes that drag (gender \n 12 \ntransvestism) is subversive only in specific locations \u2013 its political impact depends on \nboth the performance itself and its reception. Gagnier (2000, p. 42, following \nSchocket) extends Butler\u2019s reluctance to overstate the destabilizing possibilities of \ntransvestism \u2013 here in terms of class. Gagnier suggests that \n \n\u2018class transvestism occludes economic relations and reconstructs class as \nculture, but culture as voluntary rather more than, as in taste, a product of \none\u2019s particular history and environment \u2026 class culture can [thus] be read as \ndifference and absorbed into \u201cpluralism\u201d. This is, of course, the problem of \n\u201cmulticulturalism\u201d: it can be treated as a mere celebration of diverse \n\u201ccultures\u201d rather than also being embedded in political and economic \ninequalities.\u2019 \n \nTaylor (2005b, p. #4.1) critiques queer theory on a similar basis; its neglect of \ninequalities \u2013 as structured not least by class \u2013 in the resources available for the \nconstruction of alternative identities, so not everyone is able to successfully refashion \nthemselves on a whim. The key issues here are the political effects of class \ntransvestism of whatever sort, and the extent to which this form of passing \u2013 \nJohnson\u2019s (2008, p. 76) \u2018choosing [one\u2019s] clothing and leisure activities as if it \ninvolved living in a dressing up box\u2019 - is accessible to all. These questions, in \nparticular relating to the commodification of style, lie at the heart of our analysis of \nchavinism.  \n \n 13 \nPART 2: THE CHAV IN CLASS SOCIETY \n \nThe chav and commodification \n \n\u2018Chav\u2019 is now a commonplace socioeconomic signifier in the British cultural lexicon. \nWidespread coverage in newspaper articles, websites, television programmes and \nbooks demarcates the chav by its apparently distinctive demographic, attitudes, \nbehaviours, consumption patterns and language. Chavs are imagined to be mainly \nwhite and to live on council estates; to be poor, usually young and either unemployed \nor working in a manual, poorly remunerated occupation such as hairdressing, \ncleaning, security or checkout cashier. The \u2018typical\u2019 chav is also prone to violence, \ntakes drugs, smokes cigarettes, drinks excessive amounts of alcohol, eats junk food \nand is sexually promiscuous.  \n \nFurther, chavs are constructed as highly brand-conscious and having a particular \npenchant for Burberry, Nike, Louis Vuitton and Adidas, as well as sportswear like \nfootball shirts, tracksuits, trainers and baseball caps. To accessorize, they wear \u2018bling\u2019 \n\u2013 gaudy diamond and gold jewellery - and they are avid consumers of tanning \nproducts and mobile phones alike. The apocryphal chav also has their own vernacular; \na mixture of abbreviations from text message code (eg, \u2018u\u2019 for you or \u2018l8\u2019 for late) and \nimported US R&B slang (eg, \u2018check it\u2019 for \u2018look at it\u2019 or \u2018diss\u2019 for \u2018disrespect\u2019), plus \nliberal use of expletives.  \n \nChavs are depicted, then, as having a particular style, and the rise of the chav as a \ncultural category is directly connected to the commodification of this style. Thus  \n 14 \n\u2018\u201cchav culture\u201d has developed around an identity and fashion style which is both \npopular and commercially viable\u2019 (Johnson, 2008, p. 66 \u2013 emphasis added). One way \nin which we can make sense of this \u2013 Fraser\u2019s chavinism writ rather larger - in British \nconsumer culture is to connect it to Bourdieu\u2019s (1984) concept of cultural \nintermediaries, and their role in the circulation of ideals of style and cool. These \nintermediaries are always searching for the latest \u2018undiscovered\u2019 symbolic item \n(Klein, 2001), and the characteristics of certain socio-economic, sexual or ethnic \ngroups have as a consequence oftentimes been commodified \u2013 as also captured in \n\u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1997) discussion of multiculturalism. Similarly, MacCannell and \nMacCannell argue that late capitalist society appropriates not just labour, but also \nmarginal lifestyles, transforming them into commodities and selling them back to the \npeople who originally \u2018owned\u2019 them \u2013 such as gang members\u2019 apparel being \ntransformed by jeans and sportswear manufacturers into \u2018simulacra of a hip hop urban \nexistence\u2019 (1993, p. 138).  \n \nBy contrast, chav style is not sold back to those who \u2018created [it] in the first \nplace\u2019(ibid.) \u2013 ie, the marketing of chav-as-commodity is not intended for the chav \nmarket, insofar as this market exists at all. Instead, following Skeggs (2004), the \nvarious accounts of the chav can be seen simultaneously to create and mark the chav \nbody with characteristics which become a detachable resource only for non-chav \nconsumers. For this to work, the chav has to be \u2018kept in its place\u2019, such that the gaze \nof the cultural intermediaries creates an asymmetric symbolic economy. In other \nwords, the extent to which chav style represents cultural capital in Bourdieusian terms \nis highly socially stratified.  \n \n 15 \nMoreover, \u2018chav\u2019 as an identity marker \u2013 unlike \u2018black\u2019, \u2018working-class\u2019 or \u2018gay\u2019 - is a \n\u2018collective label stuck on from the outside\u2019 (Hume, 2004, p. 2). Although identity \npolitics often turn on authenticity in other arenas of difference, we suspect few people \nwould self-identify as chavsv\n \n, pathological and abhorrent as they are assumed to be. \nIndeed the point is repeatedly made that it is publicly acceptable to hate chavs, with \nHume suggesting such sentiments are especially virulent because it is \u2018impossible to \nexpress prejudice against traditionally vulnerable minorities\u2019 (2004, p. 2) in a \nputatively politically correct society like the UK (also see Johnson, 2008, pp. 77-78). \nKudos therefore attaches to the ironic consumption of chav artefacts.  \nSo, although \u2018they\u2019 have been commodified in all the ways described above, chavs are \nstill fair game for criticism. According to Binnie and Skeggs (2004, pp. 45-46, \nfollowing Haylett; also see Skeggs, 2005, p. 970), in fact, \u2018white working-class \nculture is the abject constitutive limit by which middle-class multicultural citizenship \nis known and valorised\u2019. Chavs-as-cultural-category, then - a particularly abject \nexemplar of \u2018working-classness\u2019 - are feckless, aimless and pointless. They are \n\u2018known\u2019 less by their (un)employment than by their supposedly pathological \nconsumption habits; drinking, drug taking, smoking and the purchase of certain \nbranded consumer items. Chav consumption is both \u2018excessive\u2019 and \u2018aesthetically \nimpoverished\u2019 (Hayward and Yar, 2006, p. 14), and chavs are thus imagined as the \nantithesis of what we described earlier as \u2018first world\u2019 citizenship and productive \n\u2018middle classness\u2019. \n \nBut chav discourse is not simply an example of the middle class constructing, \nproblematizing and oppressing a particular segment of the working class: it is not just \n 16 \nthe middle class who deploy the chav label, and aspirations to class mobility do not  \nonly work upwards. In terms of the former, chav culture can act as the \u2018abject \nconstitutive limit\u2019 for respectable working class identity, as demonstrated by the \u2018Real \nGeordies\u2019\u2019 quest to distinguish themselves \u2013 despite many apparent similarities - from \nthe \u2018Charvers\u2019 in Nayak\u2019s (2006) ethnography of \u2018the affective politics of class\u2019 (p. \n828) amongst these two groups of young men in Newcastle upon Tyne. And in terms \nof the latter, Skeggs (2005, p. 975) describes  the \u2018wannabe\u2019 quality of certain \ncontemporary middle class behaviours as follows:  \n \n\u2018working-class attacks on the restrained, boring middle class have produced \nthe desire for the unrestrained, hedonistic working class, institutionalized in \nthe term \u201cmockney\u201d (mock cockney), used to apply to people like Jamie \nOliver, Guy Ritchie, Nigel Kennedy and Mick Jagger, who speak a form of \nworking-class language, while clearly embodying every other aspect of the \nmiddle class \u2026 \u2019  \n \nThus far, though, our analysis has privileged a class lens to explore the phenomenon \nof gay chavinism. We now layer onto this discussion the categories of gender and \nsexuality, exploring their intersections with class in this particular instantiation of gay \nmale consumer culture, and the implications. First we provide a brief sketch of gay \nchavinism.  \n \n 17 \nPART 3: GAY CHAVINISM AND THE AMBIVALENT POLITICS OF \nGENDER STYLING \n \nChavinism on the British gay scene \n \n\u2018Chavinism \u2026 has become endemic on the gay scene \u2026 You only have to \nread the titles of the wank-line telephone numbers to get the picture: \u201cMe gang \nplay with our dicks outside the Late Shop\u201d, \u201cLet DSS bloke shag me for a \ncrisis loan\u201d and \u201cGot me ring stretched for an oh-zee of weed\u201d. Just an \naverage night in Bermondsey or Wythenshawe then. Poverty, it seems, has \nnever been so sexual, destitution so downright dirty. Away from the queeny \nfashion scenes and the muscle mary world of steroids and shrunken scrotums, \na huge, downwardly mobile subculture is developing.\u2019 (Fraser, 2005, p. 36) \n \nAs Fraser notes above, and Johnson establishes in a more scholarly sense, the chav \nhas apparently been welcomed with open arms by the British gay male population.  \nEven a cursory glance through the gay male media in the last few years, especially \nkey outlets like Attitude magazine (where the Fraser piece appeared), indicates the \nrise of the chav as a category for organizing and experiencing the commercialization \nof male same-sex desire. Best evidence is the proliferation of advertisements for chav-\ncentred telephone lines, containing titillating images and explicit copy.. Examples of \nsex lines we have found include \u2018S**k me scally dick\u2019 and \u2018Pull me trackies down, \nspank & shag me\u2019.  \n \n 18 \nThe Internet sites of the companies responsible offer additional services for sexual \nsatisfaction, including images and clips of chavs having sex, and Internet chatrooms. \nSimilarly, Triga Movies and Pinnacle Vision market celluloid fantasies of sex with \nworking-class lads, including the October 2007 release \u2018ASBO Twinks\u2019. There are \nalso chav club nights, for instance at London\u2019s Vauxhall Tavern and G-A-Y; although \nit may predominantly be middle-class professionals sporting tracksuit bottoms and \nbaseball caps who turn up at these events, hoping to get a bit of the other in seeking \nnew sexual thrills.  \n \nIn the piece cited above, Fraser narrates his experiences of going to two such club \nnights in London. The article provides the closest thing we can find to a primary \nempirical account of gay chavinism, and two facets of his account stand out. First, \nthere is his constant worry about passing as a chav, and the concerted attention he \ngives to dressing and acting the part. Fraser describes his shopping trip for Nike- and \nAdidas-branded goods before going out, and notes that his boyfriend, whilst thinking \nhe looked relatively authentic, feared he would give himself away when he walked. In \nfact he enjoyed plenty of attention, which he attributes to his apparently aphrodisiacal \ngarb. Second, at the \u2018Rude Boyz\u2019 club night, described as \u2018council house cruising at \nits most hardcore\u2019 (Fraser, 2005, p. 36), he recounts some of the comments made by \nthe middle-class professional types he met. These included David and Josh, a couple \nfrom upmarket Islington. They were keen on a threesome with \u2018Burberry capped\u2019 \nRob, saying they \u2018[w]ouldn\u2019t mind going back to his council flat\u2019 (Fraser, 2005, p. 37) \n\u2013 although Rob in fact worked in PR and hailed from equally affluent West Dulwich.   \n \n 19 \nGiven these examples of gay chav commodity forms, we, like Johnson, are struck by \nthe commonality of themes used in selling the \u2018chav experience\u2019. Key features \u2013 all of \nwhich we noted in our discussion of the merchandising of chav style \u2013 are \nhypersexuality (including incest); drug and alcohol abuse; aggression and violence; \nunemployment, poverty and living on benefits; the council estate; and dress and \nappearance. Next we expand our analysis based on two avenues indicated by this list. \nFirst, we develop the idea of gay chavinism as style (of dress, bodily disposition etc.) \nand analyse this using a gender\/sexuality lens. Second, we contemplate the broader \nquestion of the politics of chavinism as minority consumer culture.  \n \nGay masculinity and the politics of style \n \n\u2018Being a chav for the night is a novel, not un-sexy thing, but it\u2019s essentially fancy \ndress. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for leering at men in tabards on bin trucks but \nthey\u2019re sexy precisely because they are straight and they\u2019d smash your bleedin\u2019 \nface in if they knew what you were thinking. Internalised homophobia? Fancying \nour oppressors? Probably. Who cares \u2026 \u2019 (Fraser, 2005, p. 36)  \n \nFraser makes two important observations here \u2013 first, that chavinism in part is a form \nof class transvestism, a bodily style used to cross class boundaries and create new \nidentities, however temporarily. But it is not just class identities that are being \n\u2018switched\u2019 in this move: gender\/sexual identities are likewise at stake. As Fraser \nobserves, desire for the male chav turns around a particular kind of masculinity; \npugnacious, violent, but above all straight.  \n \n 20 \nHere class intersects not only with sexuality but also and importantly with gender, in \nthat the \u2018harder\u2019 forms of masculinity which chavinism invokes are strongly, even \ninextricably, aligned with the working class (also see Johnson, 2008, p. 76). We \nshould also recall Connell\u2019s (1992, p. 736, 2002, p. 95) insistence that, all \nsociohistorical diversity aside, hegemonic masculinity is \u2018explicitly and exclusively \nheterosexual\u2019 and, in some of its variants, produces \u2018contempt and fear of effeminate \nand homosexual men\u2019; not to say homophobic violence. Gay chavinism, then, could \nbe interpreted as an acting out between gay men of desire for a heterosexual male \naggressor, pivoting ambiguously on the promise of rough sex and the threat of \nviolence (even queer bashing and rape). Indeed, and to recall earlier discussion, its \npredecessor \u2018rough trade\u2019 is often thought of as involving sex with straight men, \nespecially those with the potential for brutality.  \n \nIn exploring the contradictions of gender and sexual identities further, Gough\u2019s (1989) \naccount of the development of gay male styles in North America and Western Europe \nis helpful. The emergence of gay chavinism, and the heterosexuality it mobilizes, \nbelongs within this trajectory. As Gough suggests, the identities of gay men have \ntraditionally been strongly gendered as feminine, and this tying together of gender-\nsex-sexuality persists as a mode for their self-expression. But Gough\u2019s central point is \nthat the \u2018predominant styles of gay men have become increasingly masculine\u2019 (1989, \np. 119) since the 1970s, such that sportsman, leatherman\/biker, cowboy, skinhead, \nconstruction worker and squaddy have all been added to the gay male repertoire. All \nthese styles mimic highly masculine pursuits and occupations, and several are also \nworking-class in their associations. Gough comments that this proliferation of more \n 21 \nmasculine styles likewise expanded gay male desire for the masculine as a gender as \nwell as for the male body as a sex.  \n \nBut these developments are not unproblematic. Although they challenge the reduction \nof gay male sexuality to effeminacy, Gough posits that these newer forms of \nhomosexual desire objectify masculinity as if it existed apart from the person. This \nabstracted desire substitutes itself for the person, becoming a kind of asexual fetish. In \ngay culture just as in its heteronormative counterpart, then, masculinity becomes an \nultimately unattainable commodity that is \u2018oppressive not simply for dictating a \ncertain norm but for demanding something which cannot be achieved\u2019 (Gough, 1989, \npp. 121-122 \u2013 also see Connell, 1992, 2002; Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005). \nThese styles also reassert traditional roles which subordinate women to men, and \nperhaps imply a certain admiration for militarism and fascism.  \n \nRelatedly, Kates\u2019 (2003) ethnography of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras \nnotes the ironically over-the-top character of the various male bodies on display, and \nremarks that these \u2018[s]ubversive consumer practices may uncover and problematize \ngendered norms by parodically accentuating them, humorously delegitimizing their \nclaims to authority\u2019 (p. 10). In part, then, Kates presents the festival as a progressive \nsocial event, indexing a sense of gender freedom. However, he also notes the paucity \nof imperfect bodies on show at Mardi Gras \u2013 most are a toned and buffed celebration \nof a specific type of masculinity. Following Butler, Kates suggests that this \narticulation of gay identity may exemplify the parodic reproduction of heterosexist \nmasculine norms of \u2018competition, violence [and] dominance\u2019 without in any way \nundermining them -  despite its \u2018progressive stylistic guise\u2019 (p. 8). Moreover, despite \n 22 \nMardi Gras\u2019s liminality, it is simultaneously a site where people can \u2018let off sexual \nsteam\u2019 whilst the mainstream remains untouched \u2013 just as Bakhtin originally observed \nwith regard to how the poor used the carnival as a way of coping with their \nwretchedness. In sum, the gender and sexual politics of the gay male styles discussed \nby Gough and Kates are deeply equivocal.  \n \nIf chavinism turns in part on the desire of gay men to pass as and\/or to act out sexual \nfantasies about (\u2018hard\u2019, \u2018tough\u2019) working-class, heterosexual men, an additional issue \nappears when we consider how these straight men relate to same-sex desire. Here \n\u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1997) discussion of the Yugoslav People\u2019s Army and the question of why \nthis army \u2013 or any other - resisted accepting gay men and women as members is \npertinent, albeit from a different institutional context. During his own service \u017di\u017eek \nwitnessed extreme forms of homophobia, where anyone discovered to be gay was \nsubject to various forms of abuse and summarily dismissed. Yet the culture of the \nPeople\u2019s Army was \u2018excessively permeated with an atmosphere of homosexual \ninnuendo\u2019 (1997, p. 32). \u017di\u017eek describes, for instance, standing in line for food, where \nit was commonplace for the men to stick an uninvited finger into someone else\u2019s \nbackside, withdraw it quickly and then laugh about it with everyone else.  \n \nTypical accounts of why gay people are discouraged from joining up are framed in \nterms of \u2018threat\u2019 \u2013 that they potentially undermine the \u2018phallic and patriarchal\u2019 sexual \neconomy of army relations (\u017di\u017eek, 1997, p. 32). But \u017di\u017eek dismisses this explanation, \nand argues that the army fundamentally depends on homosexuality for its existence. In \nother words, \n \n 23 \n\u2018the Army community itself relies on a thwarted\/disavowed homosexuality as \nthe key component of the soldiers\u2019 male-bonding \u2026 This fragile coexistence \nof extreme and violent homophobia with a thwarted, that is, publicly \nunacknowledged, \u201cunderground\u201d homosexual libidinal economy, bears \nwitness to the fact that the discourse of the military community can only \noperate by way of censoring its own libidinal foundation.\u2019 (1997, p. 33) \n \nExtending \u017di\u017eek\u2019s point, we might interpret gay chavinism as a gender style which \nrehearses the same libidinal repression of same-sex desire around which notoriously \nhomophobic and patriarchal institutions like the army are culturally organized, in that \nchavinism\u2019s almost literally unspeakable object of desire is the laddish, homosocial, \nworking-class but also and necessarily bellicose, straight, homophobic man. As \nFraser remarks, \u2018they\u2019re sexy precisely because they are straight and they\u2019d smash \nyour bleedin\u2019 face in if they knew what you were thinking\u2019. Taking \u017di\u017eek together \nwith Gough and Kates implies that, whilst gay chavinism may well expand \ntransgressively the repertoire of homosexual desire, it also potentially reinforces \nhighly problematic elements of hegemonic (\/ heterosexual\/ homophobic) masculinity. \n \nSYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSION \n \nWe now draw together our speculations on gay chavinism as minority consumer \nculture before sketching out a potential empirical agenda. First, chavinism perhaps \nsubverts hegemonic homosexuality in its invocation of the abject cultural category of \nchav as sexually desirable, indeed worth spending serious money on, whether as \ncommodity (eg, chav pornography) or as temporarily borrowed identity (dressing \n 24 \ndown as chav). The chav identity revolves around \u2018tasteless\u2019 consumer goods, \nunemployment, violence, heavy drinking and drug taking, and hypersexuality. \nChavinism is therefore potentially disruptive of both class and sexuality as categories \nof difference. Just as gender transvestism might unsettle assumptions about the \nrigidity of the male\/female divide, so chavinism perhaps undermines assumptions \nabout the gay man as desexualized, cultivated, bourgeois consumer par excellence. It \nmay valorize a currently \u2018non-admired\u2019 or \u2018dishonoured\u2019 form of same-sex desire, as \nwell as indexing the potentially homophobic nature of hegemonic homosexuality. As \nsuch, it represents one possibility for contesting this hegemony, and the exclusions, \nsilences and hierarchies it reproduces amongst gay men.  \n \nThis is even more likely if we assume that some of the men taking part in or buying \nchav porn or going to chav club nights self-identify as both gay and working-class - if \nnot necessarily chav. Given the absence of any systematic empirical work in the area, \nwe cannot yet say whether \u2013 or how - the discourse of chavinism is reproduced or \ncontested by working-class gay men themselves. However, some of Taylor\u2019s (2005c, \np. 378) working-class lesbian respondents certainly felt excluded from \u2018scene spaces\u2019 \nbecause these were predicated on the aforementioned high-octane consumption \npractices, as reflected in widespread deployment of \u2018designer dress codes and \nstringent door policies\u2019. Thus the opportunity to ask whether working-class gay men \nrecognize themselves in \u2018Chav plc\u2019, and whether they desire upward mobility and the \ntastes of their middle-class counterparts, we would argue, at least offers a similar  \navenue for discursively pluralizing gay male experience and challenging the \nprevailing \u2018reification\u2019 of \u2018gayness\u2019 (Connell, 1992). \n \n 25 \nOn the other hand, any such pluralization renders yet more precarious the assimilation \nof (certain kinds of) gay men into the heteronormative mainstream, in the same way \nas AIDS activism \u2018dislodged certain gay men from their tenuous position within the \ndominant classes by transforming unmarked individuals into members of a \nstigmatised group\u2019 (Cohen, cited in Binnie and Skeggs, 2004, p. 44). Equally, gay \nchavinism potentially rearticulates the familiar construction of the male libido as \nutterly unselective about its objects of attachment or the consequences of its practices \n(Hollway, 1989), reproducing a masculinity which turns on force and violence and a \nlibidinal economy based on the repression of homoerotic bonding. Chavinism can be \nread as an unexamined acceptance, even celebration, amongst gay men of the \nhegemonic understanding of male desire as irrepressibly aggressive, bringing together \ngay and straight men in an odd complicity. This is of especial concern given \nhomosexuality\u2019s discursive associations with indiscriminate and pathological forms of \ndesire such as paedophilia. Gender speaks more forcefully here than sexuality or \nclass, with chavinism becoming a cultural form uniting all men in relation to the \nothers of hegemonic masculinity.  \n \nRelatedly, chavinism can be seen as reasserting patriarchal gender structures, which \nbegs questions about gay men\u2019s complex relationship with feminism. Jacobs (1997) \nargues that, whilst gay men and women may share an interest in challenging Rich\u2019s \n(1983) \u2018compulsory heterosexuality\u2019, divergent economic interests also point to a \ngrowing chasm between them:  \n \n\u2018the growing significance of the nonfamilial structures of women\u2019s economic \nsubordination have brought gay men\u2019s economic interests more into line with \n 26 \nthose of other men, and into greater conflict with those of women in general. \nGay men\u2019s willingness to articulate these interests is increasing as sexuality is \nperceived as less of a determinant of gender identity.\u2019 (Jacobs, 1997, p. 178) \n \nChavinism might not belong within this economic line of reasoning, but perhaps there \nis a parallel cultural argument to be made; one where sexuality is masked by the gay \ndesire for masculine gender. After all, as Connell remarks, \u2018even effeminate gay men \nmay draw economic benefits from the overall subordination of women\u2019 (1992, p. \n737). \n \nWe could also agree with Johnson that gay chavinism conceals material class \ninequalities whilst seemingly making them more visible. Class is not simply a matter \nof choice: it is more than culture, more than values and demeanours. The middle-class \ngay man who seeks out chavs for sex, buys chav porn or goes to chav club nights is \narguably gambling with the benefits that his socio-economic position affords him in the \nnormal run of things. But chavinism could simultaneously be read as not much more \nthan a walk on the wild side; and Skeggs (2005, p. 971) and Johnson (2008, p. 75) \nboth comment that an important aspect of the commodification of class difference is \nthe marketing to the bourgeoisie of safe ways of temporarily venturing into dangerous \nterrain.  \n \nThus chavinism can be considered a licensed, short-lived transgression for the \nprofessional middle classes, who can re-stylize themselves for kicks but do not need \nto reside low down on the social ladder. After all, middle-class gay men are unlikely \nto ever watch their lives \u2018slide out of view\u2019, as the Sheffield band Pulp once put it, \n 27 \nlike those whose supposed trappings they have borrowed for a sweaty Saturday night \nout clubbing. Gay chavinism can therefore be interpreted as fixing and essentializing \nthe working class anew, for carnivalesque middle-class sex tourism.  \n \nIt is also true that, as Fraser (2005, p. 37) avers, the gay class tourist is unlikely to \nsucceed in passing as chav. Still, any such failure will probably not cause him many \ndifficulties \u2013 unless he strays beyond the commodified zone of chavinism into the \nmaterial realities of the council estate. Johnson (2008, p. 73) extends this to argue that \nthe inauthenticity of a chav performance by a middle-class man (re)constructs him as \n\u2018a successful consumer of the chav commodity rather than as the object itself\u2019. This is \nthe converse of our argument that chavinism cuts across the class dimension of \nhegemonic homosexuality: here the \u2018product\u2019 has to remain other to the consumer in \norder to be appealing, so chavinism actually relies upon hegemonic homosexuality.  \nWe might even see a kind of incorporation at work here, suggesting that hegemonic \nhomosexuality absorbs elements of other versions of homosexuality so as to \nreconfigure and bolster itself, as Brittan (1989, pp. 184-187) asserts with regard to \nhegemonic masculinity. In this reading, Johnson\u2019s hierarchy of \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have \nnots\u2019 remains entirely unscathed. \n \nOverall, whilst the political consequences of social actions (consumption included) \nare difficult to ascertain at any analytical stage, we would provisionally suggest that \nchavinism, as a sexual fantasy organized by the commodity economics of astute \ncultural producers, contains a number of contradictory elements. But to go any further \nat this stage risks putting the conceptual cart before the empirical horse. The questions \nof how self-identified professional and working-class gay men relate to chavinism; \n 28 \nwhat the experience of \u2018dressing down\u2019 is like; what the motivations are for it; how \nthe relevant class and gender dynamics structure the possibilities of homosexual \nexperience or overlap to produce constellations of entitlement and marginalization \narticulate complex issues associated with meanings, experiences, desires and \nsubjectivity at the intersections of class, gender and sexuality.  \n \nIn short, any construction of homosexuality, \u2018hegemonic\u2019 or \u2018subordinate\u2019, is always \nfashioned in relation to its others and, in lived empirical reality, is always cross-cut \nwith other identifications, like gender and class. Thus these constructions bear further \nscrutiny via the systematic collection of primary empirical data, so that we are able to \nexplore gay men\u2019s \u2018practical relationships to collective images or models\u2019 (Connell \nand Messerschmidt, 2005, p. 841) of homosexuality and to understand their gendered, \nsexual and class consequences. \n \n 29 \nREFERENCES \n \nBadgett, L.M.V.

One of our central arguments is that this is not an appropriate assumption about gay men in \nthe UK \u2013 or indeed anywhere else.  \nii Or perhaps more accurately \u2018dressing down\u2019, if it is indeed professional gay men who are engaged in \nthis activity. \niii \u2018Rough trade\u2019 is a term from \u2018Polari\u2019, the British gay slang. It originally referred to a casual sexual \npartner but evolved in later usage to suggest that the \u2018trade\u2019 in question is a man of lower \nsocioeconomic status \u2013 hence \u2018rough\u2019. \niv The almost exclusive focus in this literature is on gay men, rather than lesbians, as consumers.  \nv Notable exceptions to the self-identification rule include journalist Julie Burchill, who produced a \ndocumentary for Sky One, screened in February 2005. There she celebrated her chav roots and \ncomplained about the vilification of chavs.  \n"}
