INTRODUCTION \n \nThe structural mechanics of complex layered structures is governed by internal physical \nmechanisms that have non-linear force versus displacement relationships.  In most practical \ninstances, such behaviour has a small influence on the global behaviour of the structure and \nengineering analysis can be carried out using linearised constitutive equations.  However, as \nthe complexity of the layered structure increases and the loading application becomes more \ndemanding, this simplified approach breaks down and leads to significant and unacceptable \nerrors in design analysis. \n \nOnce such case is that of flexible pipes, umbilicals and marine cables used in the exploration \nof oil and gas deposits under the sea-bed in very deep water (1000 to 2000 m depth). \n \nThese are slender structures of between 0.1 and 0.75 m in diameter and up to 3000m in length \n\u2013 freely suspended in the water column or laying on the sea bed.  The internal composition of \nthese structures is a combination of cylindrical elastomer sheaths and fluid barriers combined \n 2 \nwith helically wound armour wire or bar layers and in some cases helically wound inter-\nlinked carcass strips.  The interface between the layers relies only on contact forces with \nradial pressure transmission and tangential or axial friction forces being the only mechanisms \nthat are in play. \n \nThe structural mechanics of these complex layered structures has been extensively studied.  It \nis characterised by four principal phenomena as follows: \n \n1. The structure exhibits a bi-linear hysteretic bending moment against curvature \nrelationship arising from the progressive activation of friction and consequential \nslipping between adjacent layers. \n2. Torsional and tensile forces and deflection are coupled due to the structural behaviour of \nthe helical armour wires. \n3. The torsional movement against twist relationship is bi-linear and arises from the \nlocking or un-locking of the helical armour wires due to the direction of twist. \n4. The axial stiffness is asymmetric for tensile and compressive loads as the armour wires \nencounter different resistance to inward and outward radial displacements. \n \nAs the oil industry has pushed the deployment of these structures towards increasing water \ndepth, the influence of the above effects on global behaviour and possible failure has become \nmore important. \n \nThese slender structures are used in deep water within catenaries at relatively low tension \nwhere dynamic effects can induce transient compression forces.  At the same time, the effect \nof very high external hydrostatic pressure in deep water is to induce a so called \u2018effective \ntension\u2019 term that is identical in its physical effects to a compressive loading on the structure.  \nSeyed and Patel (1992) describe the formulation and effect of this \u2018effective tension\u2019 term.  A \nfurther issue is the axial-torsional coupled behaviour of these structures that, at low cyclic \ntension, can lead to looping instabilities which are influenced by the ratio of tensile to \ntorsional stiffness.  Tan and Witz (1993 and 1995) give an analysis of this but only using a \nlinearised stiffness and ignoring bi-linear force-displacement relationships. \n \nThere is an extensive body of research literature characterising the structural behaviour of \nslender structures with helically wound armour layers.  This has been built upon the work of \nLove (1944) setting out a definitive derivation of equilibrium equations for curved and \nhelically wound rods.  Although Love's equations are complex and difficult to solve \nanalytically, an alternative approach was suggested by Lutchansky (1969), which directly \ncalculates the deformation states of the helical elements according to different geometrical \nconfigurations before and after loading.  Spillers et al (1983) followed a similar approach to \ninvestigate the mechanical behaviour of a helical tape on a bent cylinder.  This work was \ncontinued by Oliveira et al (1985) who used Timoshenko's (1956, 1964) formulae, describing \nthe bending stiffness of a spring with a large helical angle, to evaluate the bending stiffness of \nhelical armour layers.  Oliveira et al neglected the effects of friction and cylindrical restriction \n- these are important aspects of the behaviour of such unbonded layered structures.  The \ncorresponding results are questionable since the helical angle of the armour layers is not \nusually large enough for Timoshenko's formulae to be applicable.  Other contributions to the \nfield have been made by Costello and Phillips (1976), Costello (1977), Le Clair and Costello \n(1986), F\u00e9ret and Bournazel (1987), Out (1989), Harte and McNamara (1990), McNamara \nand Harte (1992), Saevik (1992), McIver (1992) and Cust\u00f3dio and Vaz (2002) for both axial - \ntorsional loads and bending of these flexible structures. \n 3 \n \nHowever, much of the early work neglected the combined effects of inter-layer friction and \ncylindrical restriction which are an essential ingredient to accurately model the structural \nbehaviour of helically armoured structures.  This problem has been addressed by Witz and \nTan (1992a, 1992b), Tan et al (1991) and Pearson et al (1993) to arrive at a mathematical \nformulation that includes friction and cylindrical restriction effects.  The non-linear difficulty \nof the problem is resolved by deriving complex equilibrium equations that describe the \nbehaviour of each helical and cylindrical layer.  These equations are in a form that can be \nsolved by a numerical scheme that takes account of friction and cylindrical restrictions and \ndeals with axial variations along the structure\u2019s length.  This approach has the advantage of \nnot requiring empirical coefficients, these being a feature of the models of Knapp (1975, \n1988, 1989) and Feld (1992).  Internal friction has a significant influence on the apparent \nbending stiffness of the pipe - see Raoof and Huang (1992), Feld (1992), and Witz and Tan \n(1992b). \n \nThe stability in buckling of a slender, homogenous rod was first addressed by Euler in 1744.  \nThis has been followed up by a substantial body of work that considers the post-buckling \nproblem.  Usually a perturbation expansion technique is used for insight into the initial post-\nbuckling response for the type of equilibrium achieved.  Asymptotic solutions also enable \nanalytical investigation on extreme conditions.  However, recent advances in numerical \nprocessing capability have allowed solution of complex post-buckling configurations, \ninvolving geometrical and physical non-linearities. \n \nThe elastica solutions via elliptical integrals are presented, for instance, in Timoshenko and \nGere (1961) and Shames and Dym (1991), respectively for encastr\u00e9 and double-hinged rods.  \nThe search for post-buckled equilibrium configurations in slender rods still attracts \nconsiderable attention, given the gamut of boundary conditions, load fields, cross-section \ngeometry, type of material etc, see recent works, for instance, from Theocaris and \nPanayotounakos (1982), Stemple (1990), Lee et al (1993), Koenig and Bolle (1993), Lu and \nPerkins (1995), Heinen and Fischer (1998), Gottlieb and Perkins (1999) and Lee and Oh \n(2000). \n \nBoundary conditions play an important role in the buckling and post-buckling response as \nthey indicate the degree of the system stiffness.  Wang (1997) presents a solution for \nasymmetric boundary conditions employing a shooting method for numerically integrating the \nset of governing equations for an initially perfectly straight rod.  In addition initial post-\nbuckling and extreme load analyses are respectively dealt with by perturbation and asymptotic \nexpansions.  Vaz and Silva (2003) extend Wang\u2019s work by considering a rotational spring so \na solution is obtained from double-hinged to hinged-built-in end conditions. \n \nInitial geometric imperfections are known to play an important role in the buckling and post-\nbuckling behaviour in many stability phenomena, see Tauchert and Lu (1987), but this effect \nis not investigated in this paper. \n \nThis paper is concerned with developing a methodology for the buckling and post-buckling \nbehaviour of a slender structure with a bi-linear bending moment versus curvature property.   \nA generalized solution is used to show the variation of displacement behaviour that can arise.  \nThis generalized methodology is an intermediate step towards more representative modeling \nof the global behaviour of slender structures that have bi-linear bending moment \ncharacteristics and are subjected to cyclic tensile and compressive loadings. \n 4 \n2. THE MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION \n \nConsider a homogeneous, inextensible and initially straight rod with length L  subjected to a \nperfectly centered axial load P , as shown in figure 1a.  As the load is progressively increased \nthe rod becomes unstable and buckles laterally at a critical load followed by large post-\nbuckled deflections as the load is increased further.  For linear elastic isotropic materials and \nassuming a pure bending cross-section behaviour, the critical buckling load is given by \n22\nLEIP\ncr\n!= , where E  is the Young\u2019s Modulus and I  is the principal minimum inertia of \nthe cross-section area.  Furthermore, a closed form analytical solution via elliptical integrals is \navailable for description of the post-buckled regime. This latter problem is referred to in this \npaper as simple elastica.  Now let\u2019s assume that the bending moment versus curvature of the \nrod exhibits bi-linear behaviour, that is, the rod cross-section bending stiffness is substantially \nreduced after a given critical curvature is reached.  This paper aims to consistently investigate \nthe effect of the loss of bending stiffness in the post-buckled configuration of such slender \nrods. \n \nFigure 1a indicates that the curvature distribution in the rod ranges from zero at 0=S  (point \nO) to a maximum value at 2LS =  (point B).  If this maximum curvature is smaller than the \ncritical curvature the post-buckled configuration is described by an analytical solution.  \nHowever, when the critical curvature reaches point B for a certain load (or end angle ! , or \nfree end displacement ! ) the rod starts \u201cyielding\u201d, and two regions with different constitutive \nrelations will take place.  The segment OA, herein referred by the index 1=i , remains stiff, \nwhereas segment AB ( 2=i ) will be subjected to a smaller bending stiffness and is then more \n\u201cflexible\u201d.  Continuity conditions must be assured at point A ( LS != ), where the parameter \n! , 210 !< \" , defines the transition point.  Furthermore note that the curvature is critical at \nthe transition point. \n \nClassically, a mathematical model that describes the rod equilibrium configuration may be \nconstructed from geometrical compatibility, equilibrium of forces and moments and \nconstitutive relations applied to an infinitesimal rod element, depicted in figure 1b.  Note that \nthere is no force component in the Y  - axis direction since no distributed load is considered \nand the boundary conditions are assumed hinged-hinged. \n \nGeometrical Compatibility \nThe trigonometrical relations in the rod infinitesimal element dS  (see figure 1b) yield: \n \n( )\ni\ni\ndS\ndX\n!cos=  (1a) \n( )\ni\ni\ndS\ndY\n!sin=  (1b) \n \nWhere S  is the rod arch-length ( LS !!0 ), ( )\nii\nYX ,  are the Cartesian coordinates of the \npost-buckled rod and \ni\n!  is the angle between the tangent of the deflected rod centroid and the \nX  - axis.  Note that due to the symmetrical nature of the problem the material domain may be \nlimited to 20 LS !! .  Consequently regions 1=i  and 2=i  are respectively defined for \nLS !\"\"0  and 2LSL !<\" .  From differential geometry the curvature \ni\n!  is defined as: \n 5 \n \ni\ni\ndS\nd\n!=\n\"\n \n(1c) \n \nEquilibrium of Forces and Moments \nA schematic of the internal forces and moments in the rod infinitesimal element is also shown \nin figure 1b.  The equilibrium of forces and bending moment respectively yields: \n \n0=\ndS\ndP\ni\n \n(2a) \n( )\nii\ni\nP\ndS\ndM\n!sin=\n \n(2b) \n \nWhere \ni\nP  is the force component in the X  - axis direction and \ni\nM  is the bending moment. \n \nConstitutive Relations \nThe rod cross-section presents a bi-linear bending moment versus curvature relation, see \nfigure 2.  This constitutive condition is typical in un-bonded layered structures such as \numbilical cables and flexible pipes, for instance, where the rod cross-section at a first moment \nexhibits a large bending stiffness before a critical curvature is reached, and from this point the \nbending stiffness is significantly reduced.  This mechanism originates when the bent helical \nlayers are initially impeded to displace laterally due to Coulomb friction, as described by Witz \nand Tan (1992b), F\u00e9ret et al (1995) and Leroy and Estrier (2001).  Note also that a Bernoulli-\nEuler pure bending condition is also considered herein.  Hence: \n \ncrifEIM !\"!!= 111  (3a) \n( ) crcr ifEIEIM !>!\"!+!= 222 1 ##  (3b) \n \nWhere EI  is the initial bending stiffness, \ncr\n!  is the critical curvature and !  is the reduction \nfactor for the secondary !\"M  curve. \nTherefore, substituting equations (3a) and (3b) into (2b) results: \n \n( ) crif\nEI\nP\ndS\nd\n!\"!=\n!\n11\n11\nsin #\n \n(4a) \n( ) crif\nEI\nP\ndS\nd\n!>!=\n!\n22\n22\nsin \"\n#  \n(4b) \n \nFull Unloading \nWhen the load is completely removed a residual and permanent deformation develops if any \npoint of the rod exceeds the critical curvature.  The unloading process may follow paths A or \nB (figure 2), depending on the value of the rod initial curvature.  This constitutive behaviour \nhas been observed experimentally in bending tests for flexible pipes and umbilical cables.   \nAssuming that the unloading follows the initial stiffness, then: \n \n 6 \ncrf if !\"!=! 11 0  \n(5a) \n( )( )\n( )\ncrcrcrif if !>!\"!\n+\n!#!#=!\n222\n1\n1\n$\n$\n$   \n(5b) \n( ) ( )\ncrcrf if !\n+\n>!!\n\"\n=!\n#\n#\n#\n# 11\n22\n  \n(5c) \n \nEquation (5a) indicates that the cross-section returns to its non-deformed state if the critical \ncurvature is not exceeded. Equations (5b) and (5c) respectively represent paths A and B, \nwhich are governed by a transition curvature defined by ( )\ncrT\n!+=! \"\"1 .  If the cross-\nsection curvature reaches a value within the critical and transition curvatures the unload path \nA is followed. For any value above the transition curvature path B is observed. \n \n \nPartial Unloading \nThe bending moment versus curvature relationship for partial unloading is given by: \n \ncruuu ifEIM !\"!!= 111  (5d) \n( )( )[ ]\n( )\ncricricruu ifEIM !>!\"!\n+\n!#!#+!=\n2222\n1\n1\n$\n$\n$  \n(5e) \n( )[ ]\n( )\ncricruu ifEIM !\n+\n>!!\"\"!=\n#\n#\n##\n1\n1\n222\n \n(5f) \n \nWhere the subscript u  merely indicates an unloading process. \n \nBoundary Conditions \nThe boundary conditions for the double-hinged rod and continuity conditions at point A  may \nbe specified as: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 000000\n11111\n=!=\"=!== PPYX #$  (6a) \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0\n212121\n=!=!=!=! \"#\"\"#\"#### LLLYLYLXLX  (6b) \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0\n2121\n=!\"=!\"=!=!\ncrcr\nKLKLPLPPLP ####  (6c) \n( ) ( ) 022\n22\n=!= PLPL\"  (6d) \n \nWhere !  and !  are respectively the angles at points O  and A .  From equation (2a) it is seen \nthat the force P  is constant.  The effect of any other boundary conditions on the rod buckling \nand post-buckling response is significant and it may be explored using a numerical \nmethodology. \n \nThe Governing Equations \nIt is obviously convenient to reduce the set of differential equations (1a), (1b), (1c), (2a), (4a) \nor (4b) to a non-dimensional form using the following change of variables: LSs = , \n 7 \nLXx = , LYy = , EIPLp 2=  and L!=\" , where 10 !! s .  Hence the governing \nequations may be rewritten as: \n \n( )\ni\ni\nds\ndx\n!cos=\n \n(7a) \n( )i\ni\nds\ndy\n!sin=\n \n(7b) \ni\ni\nds\nd\n!\n\"\n=\n \n(7c) \n0=\nds\ndpi\n \n(7d) \n( )\n11\n1\nsin !\n\"\np\nds\nd\n=\n \n(7e) \nor  \n( )\n2\n22\nsin !\n\"\n# p\nds\nd\n=\n \n(7f) \n \nWhere the non-dimensional variables ),( ii yx  constitute the deflected rod Cartesian \ncoordinates, s  the arc-length, \ni\n!  the curvature, \ni\n!  the angle formed by the curve tangent and \nthe longitudinal x-axis, \ni\np  the longitudinal load and !  the bending stiffness reduction factor. \n \nFurthermore the boundary conditions given by equations (6a-d) may be also made non-\ndimensional: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 000000\n11111\n=!==!== ppyx \"#$  (8a) \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0\n212121\n=!=!=!=! \"#\"\"#\"#### yyxx  (8b) \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0\n2121\n=!=!=!=!\ncrcr\npppp \"#\"\"#\"##  (8c) \n( ) ( ) 02121\n22\n=!= pp\"  (8d) \n \nHence the influence of the critical curvature \ncr\n!

POST-BUCKLING SOLUTIONS \n3.1 Analytical Solution for Monotonic Loading \n \nFor a given \ncr\n!  it is possible to calculate, employing elliptical integrals, the critical values for \nthe end angle, load, maximum deflection and support longitudinal displacement, respectively \ncr\n! , \ncr\np , \nmax\ny  and \ncr\n! .  From this point part of the rod will progressively \u201cyield\u201d. \n \n 8 \nSubstituting equation (7c) in (7e) and (7f) respectively gives: \n \n( ) !\"\n\"\n##= sifp\nds\nd\n0sin\n12\n1\n2\n \n(9a) \n( ) !\"\n#\n\"\n>$= sif\np\nds\nd\n2\n1\nsin\n22\n2\n2\n \n(9b) \n \nIntegrating equation (9a) and applying appropriate boundary conditions yields: \n \n( ) ( )[ ] !\"#\n#\n$$%\u00b1= sifp\nds\nd\n0coscos2\n1\n1\n \n(10) \n \nThe sign choice in equation (10) is arbitrary as it only changes the quadrant for the deflected \nrod.

For the unloading schemes presented in Figure 2 the rod final \ncurvature f1!  and f2!  are respectively: \n \ncrif kkif != 11 0\"  (17a) \n( )( )\n( )\ncricrcrif kkkif\n!\n!\n\"\"!\"\n+\n#<$$=\n1\n1\n222\n (17b) \n( ) ( )\ncricrf kkif\n!\n!\n\"\n!\n!\n\"\n+\n>\n#\n=\n11\n22\n (17c) \n \nWhere \ni2\n!  indicates the curvature distribution after a monotonic increasing load is applied.  \nThen the final angle distribution may be numerically calculated integrating equation (7c) and \nconsidering that ( ) 021\n2\n=f! : \n \n( ) ( )\n2\n1\n21\n22\n!<= \" sdsss\ns\nff #$%\n \n(18a) \n \nThe angle in the first rod segment is constant and given by:  \n \n( ) ( ) !!\"\" ##= ss ff 021  \n(18b) \n \nThe Cartesian coordinates may now be calculated from equations (7a) and (7b): \n \n( ) ( )[ ] !\" ##= ssssx ff 0cos 11  (19a) \n( ) ( )[ ] !\" ##= ssssy ff 0sin 11  (19b) \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ]\n2\n1\ncos\n21\n212\n!<+= \" sdssxsx\ns\nfff #$#\n \n(19c) \n 11 \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ]\n2\n1\nsin\n21\n212\n!<+= \" sdssysy\ns\nff #$#\n \n(19d) \n \nEquations (19c-d) may be numerically calculated. \n \nPartial Unloading Analysis \nMaking equations (5d-f) non-dimensional and differentiating them with respect to the arc-\nlength respectively yields: \n \n( ) cruuu\nu ifp\nds\ndk\n!!\" #=\n11\n1\nsin  (20a) \n( ) ( )\n( )\ncricruuii\nu ifpp\nds\nd\n!!!\n\"\n\"\n##\n\"\n\"!\n>$\n+\n+\n%\n=\n222\n2\n1\nsinsin\n1  (20b) \n( )\n( )\ncriu\nuu if\np\nds\nd\n!\n\"\n\"\n!#\n\"\n! +\n>=\n1\nsin\n22\n2  (20c) \n \nThe first term on the right-hand-side of equation (20b) indicates that equilibrium depends on \nthe rod configuration when unloading starts.  This initial condition was curve fitted with a \nfourth order polynomial as a function of the rod arc-length.  Equations (20a-c) together with \nthe geometrical and compatibility equations (7a-d), which are still applicable, constitute a \ncomplex boundary value problem (BVP).  The boundary conditions are: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 0210000 ===!==\nuuuuuu\nyx \"#$\"  (20c) \n \nAn angle controlled solution is developed using a shooting method available in the software \nMathcad (2001) through a technique to transform the BVP into an initial value problem.  The \ninitial missing value (\nu\np ) is guessed and the boundary value endpoints, set of differential \nequations and load function returning the initial condition are defined.  Next a score function \nis employed to measure the distance between terminal and desired ( ( ) 021 =\nu\n! ) conditions \nand the equivalent initial condition is obtained.  From this point, a Runge-Kutta high order \nalgorithm may be applied to directly integrate the set of non-linear ordinary differential \nequations. \n \n \n4. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS \n \nA numerical procedure was developed using the software Matlab (2002) for the loading \ncondition.  The analyses were carried out for two non-dimensional critical curvatures, \n6545.1;5487.0=\ncr\n! , which respectively correspond to end angles 00 30;10=! .  For both \ncases four reductions in bending stiffness were considered, 01.0;1.0;5.0;1=! .  For 1=!  or \nwhen 0=\ncr\n!  the solution reverts to a full simple elastica since the !\"M  relationship is \nlinear.  On the other hand when the value of !  is reduced higher deviations from the simple \nelastica solution are expected. \n \n 12 \nThe results for each case listed above are presented in four graphs for free end displacement \nversus load ( p!\" ), position of transition point A  versus load ( p!\" ), end angle versus load \n( p!\" ) and rod maximum deflection versus load ( py !\nmax\n), respectively depicted in Figures \n3a-d and 4a-d for 6545.1;5487.0=\ncr\n! .  In addition, the simple elastica for \n01.0;1.0;5.0;1=!  are also plotted in Figure 3a and 4a.  The angles !  in those figures refer \nto the post-buckled configurations plotted in Figures 5a-b.  The general behaviour for all \ngraphs and both critical curvatures are similar with an expected non-linear response delay \n(shift) for the higher value of \ncr\n! .  Consequently note that for the lower value of \ncr\n!  the \ndiscrepancies are rather more accentuated.  For both cases when the critical curvature is \nreached the rod becomes more flexible so an immediate initial reduction in load may be \nobserved.  This means that if the process is load controlled (see vertical line) a jump \nphenomenon occurs.  For 00 30;10=!  the rod becomes initially stable, i.e., no jump occurs, \nroughly for 733.0;976.0!\" , respectively.  The stable window for 6545.1=\ncr\n!  is somewhat \nwider since the rod is stiffer, i.e., the inclination of the displacement - load relationship is \nlower.  When unloading, a discontinuous jump may also occur if a bi-linear elastic model is \nbeing considered.  Note that that the jump is larger for lower values of !  in monotonic \nloading or in elastic reversible processes.  Observe that for each combination of \ncr\n!  and !  \nthere is a minimum value of !  which denotes that part of the rod is subjected to reduction in \ncurvature.  Roughly this situation occurred for an end angle approximately equal to 130o for \nthe range of parameters investigated here.  Solution beyond this point was not developed in \nthis paper. \n \nFigures 3a and 4a show that if process is displacement controlled the load reduces to a \nminimum value and then it grows again.  The lower the !  the larger is the reduction in load.  \nFor the same end angle !  the difference in load and end displacement are higher for lower \nvalues of ! .  Furthermore note the uniqueness of the p!\"  relation. \n \nComparisons between Figures 3b and 4b show that for small values of \ncr\n!  or !  a longer rod \nsegment is affected.  Now note the uniqueness of the p!\"  relation. \n \nIn figures 3c and 4c it is clear that the lower value of \ncr\n!  potentially enhances the influence of \n! .  It also indicates the extremity final angle when the rod is post-buckled with load or \ndisplacement control.  The p!\"  relation is unique. \n \nFigures 3d and 4d indicate that \nmax\ny  grows with decreasing !  for both values of \ncr\n! .  The \npoint of maximum displacement !  tends 090  when !  tends to zero, and interesting the load \nalso conveys to a minimum.  The function py !\nmax\n presents a non-uniqueness feature. \n \nFigures 5a and 5b display the rod configuration after being monotonically loaded, \nrespectively for 6545.1;5487.0=\ncr\n! .  Only the half space is plotted since the problem is \nsymmetric.  The geometric configurations are presented for 000000 120;90;60;30;20;10=! .  \nIf the critical curvature is not exceeded, a solution is obviously given by the linear elastica.  It \ncan be seen that the value of the bending stiffness reduction factor significantly influences the \nrod post-buckled configuration.  Observe from Figures 3a-d and 4a-d that these equilibrium \nconfigurations are reached with very different parameters \nmax\nyp !!! \"# .  Another \n 13 \ninteresting feature is that the lower the value of !  the longer is the \u201cnearly straight\u201d segment, \nhowever the rod experiences higher localized curvatures.  On the other hand the rod bows \n\u201cmore uniformly\u201d at high values of ! . \n \nFigures 6a-c and 7a-c show the geometrical configuration for 6545.1;5487.0=\ncr\n! , \nrespectively, and each value of ! , when the rod is monotonically loaded until \n000000\n120;90;60;30;20;10=!  and then the load is completely removed.  The final \nconfiguration of the first segment, as expected, is a straight line.  A reduction in curvature is \nnoticed, but a similar shape pattern is kept.  Significant hysteresis is observed for lower values \nof ! , with permanent deflection and little elastic restoration.  This characteristic is more \npronounced for 5487.0=\ncr\n! . \n \nFigure 8 presents the geometrical configurations for an unloading process when 5487.0=\ncr\n! ,  \n5.0=!  and initial end angles are 000 120;90;30=! .  It is seen that as the load is removed \nthe curvature reduces but a permanent deformation remains.  The parameters governing this \nunloading process are seen in Figures 9a and 9b, respectively for the curves p!\"  and p!\" .  \nDue to its uniqueness characteristic the unloading can be load or displacement controlled.  \nThe less the rod is deflected the higher is the elastic restoring force and the rod tends to return \nto its original straight configuration.  \n \nTable 1 shows the transition curvatures for \ncr\n!  and !  values employed in this paper. The \ncritical and transition curvatures establish the boundaries for the type of unloading path \nexperienced by a cross-section.  \n \nTable 1 -  Transition Curvatures \n!\"  0.01 0.1 0.5 1.0 \n!\ncr\n\"  !\nT\n\"  \n0.5487 55.4187 6.0357 1.6461 1.0974 \n1.6545 167.1045 18.1995 4.9635 3.3090 \n \nTables 2a and 2b give the type of unloading path for the cases simulated in this paper, \nrespectively for\ncr\n!  = 0.5487 and 1.6545. \n \n \n \nTable 2a - Unloading Mechanism for \ncr\n!  = 0.5487 \n!\"  0.01 0.1 0.5 \n( )!deg\"  cr!  = 0.5487 \n10 Elastic unloading Elastic unloading Elastic unloading \n20 Path A Path A Path A \n30 Path A Path A Path B \n60 Path A Path A Path B \n90 Path A Path B Path B \n120 Path A Path B Path B \n \n \n 14 \nTable 2b -  Unloading Mechanism for \ncr\n!  = 1.6545  \n!\"  0.01 0.1 0.5 \n( )!deg\"  cr!  = 1.6545 \n10 Elastic unloading Elastic unloading Elastic unloading \n20 Elastic unloading Elastic unloading Elastic unloading \n30 Elastic unloading Elastic unloading Elastic unloading \n60 Path A Path A Path A \n90 Path A Path A Path B \n120 Path A Path A Path B \n \n \n6. CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe mathematical formulation for the post-buckling analysis of double-hinged slender rods \nsubjected to compressive axial load and with cross-section bending moment \u2013 curvature \nrelationship bi-linear was presented in this paper.  This constitutive flexural model may arise \nfrom physical or geometrical non-linear characteristics, such as plastic or hyper elastic strains \nor internal friction mechanisms.  Analytical and numerical solutions are respectively \ndeveloped for monotonic loading and unloading, the former via elliptical integrals whereas \nthe latter one employing transformation of the one point boundary value to an initial value \nproblem through a shooting method.  Consequently the hysteresis originating from a complex \nloading history may be calculated.  The variables are made non-dimensional so it is seen that \ntwo parameters govern the solutions: the critical curvature \ncr\n!  which establishes the transition \nin the cross-section flexibility and the reduction factor for the bending stiffness ! .  As the \nrod post-buckling residual strength is already low, i.e., it can develop large deflections with \nsmall increase in load after buckling, it is seen that a reduction in bending stiffness is \ndetrimental to the system stability.  For a given critical curvature the range of bending \nstiffness reduction factor where solution is stable is very narrow.  Outside this region the rod \nis initially unstable so it may jump to another equilibrium configuration if load is \nprogressively applied.  When the critical curvature is exceeded and the rod is unloaded the \nprocess is not conservative and irreversible yielding permanent deformations.  Larger elastic \nrestorations are experienced for larger bending stiffness reduction factors and larger critical \ncurvatures. \n \nThe next phase of the work presented here will be to apply the post-buckling methodology to \nthe global in-place analysis of a submerged structure that exhibits bi-linear bending \ncharacteristics.    The work will follow two lines of enquiry \u2013 the first will examine how bi-\nlinear behaviour influences the occurrences of looping and twisting instabilities in structures \nthat have, hitherto, been analysed using linear bending moment relationships.  A second line \nof enquiry will examine the same problem for structures in very deep water where high \nhydrostatic pressure induces an \u2018effective compression\u2019 on such structures. \n7.
