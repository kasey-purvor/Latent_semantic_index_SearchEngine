(Latin America Otherwise. Languages, Empires, Nations.)\nPp. xii+234. Durham\u2013London: Duke University Press, 2007. \u00a353 (cloth),\n\u00a313.99 ( paper). 978 0 8223 3930 4; 978 0 8223 3939 7\nJEH (58) 2007 ; doi :10.1017\/S0022046907001704\nThe Dominican Friar Bartolome\u00b4 de Las Casas, appointed by the Crown of Castile\nas \u2018protector of the Indians \u2019, is one of the most emblematic figures of the\nSpanish empire in the New World, on account of his exceptional stance against\nthe illegitimate violence with which the native peoples were subjected to a colonial\nregime. Las Casas did not limit himself to denouncing abuses and cruelty, but\nalso fought a long and intense ideological battle to define liberally the rights to\nliberty and property of the American peoples according to the principles of Christian\ntheology and natural law. Although his rhetoric was repetitive, and some of his\nclaims exaggerated, he conducted a great deal of historical research into native\nhistory, developing a remarkable analysis of gentile barbarism and civilisation.\nFurthermore, he also sought to restructure the legal and institutional bases for the\ngovernance of the colonies, in order to erode the mechanisms, such as encomienda,\nthat made possible the continued abuse and exploitation of the Indians. Unlike many\nof his contemporaries, Las Casas had a very elevated concept of the capacities of the\nnatives, and a radical position concerning the fact that the evangelisation of idolaters\ncould never justify conquest or enslavement. His most developed position \u2013 one\nthat the crown and people of Castile were not ready to embrace \u2013 radicalised\nthe authoritative principles established by the neo-Thomist theologian Francisco de\nVitoria and his disciples in the \u2018School of Salamanca\u2019. It consisted of supporting the\nincorporation into the Catholic Monarchy of Amerindian polities as independent\nkingdoms ruled by the natives themselves (much like Naples or Sicily were ruled),\ngenerally according to their own customs and civilisation, which Las Casas always\nextolled, but peacefully inviting them to embrace Christianity and reject idolatrous\ncults. They were to become equal subjects of a paternalistic crown. Daniel Castro\u2019s\naim in his book consists of subjecting the status of Las Casas to critical scrutiny\nbeyond the contrasting images, positive and negative, that he has inevitably attracted\nsince the sixteenth century. He argues that the practical outcomes of the action of\nLas Casas and his legacy need to be reassessed beyond facile mythologies, in\nparticular from the native point of view. This exercise leads Castro to the conclusion\nthat Las Casas was in reality a supporter of empire, and that his ability to influence\nREV I EWS 767\ncrown policy in favour of the natives has been exaggerated. His belief in\nevangelisation was a form of \u2018ecclesiastical imperialism\u2019 and represented a\n\u2018colonisation of consciousness \u2019, however benevolent, whilst his notorious dispute\nwith the humanist Juan Gine\u00b4s de Sepu\u00b4lveda in Valladolid (1550\u20131) offered the crown\nthe possibility to pick and choose, rather than limit, its action. Hence the rulers of\nCastile could on the one hand embrace a paternalistic rhetoric, and on the other\ncontinue to support a harsh and exploitative colonial system. Las Casas offered a\nuseful counterpoint to settler demands, but the legal reforms he instigated, the New\nLaws of 1542 and Philip II\u2019s ordinances of 1573, were either rejected by the colonists,\nor gave the colonial authorities the discretional power to implement them against\nnative interests. Castro also points out that Las Casas felt more comfortable working\nclose to the centres of power \u2013 lobbying for reforms \u2013 than as a missionary amongst\nIndians, and accomplished very little as bishop of Chiapas (he was indeed fiercely\ncriticised by prominent Franciscan missionaries like Toribio de Motolin\u0131\u00b4a, no less\nthan by lay settlers and imperial ideologues). Unfortunately, Castro\u2019s account of the\nlife and thought of Las Casas, albeit competent, is largely derivative and the analysis\noften superficial. He fails to engage seriously with much of the most balanced\nhistoriography, for example the work of Marcel Bataillon, Anthony Pagden, David\nBrading, Sabine MacCormack or Vidal Abril Castello\u00b4 (who is not even mentioned in\nthe bibliography), relying instead on attacking the more extreme and outdated\nworks. His use of sources lacks sophistication and is poorly contextualised, and\nsometimes the best editions \u2013 let alone the manuscripts \u2013 are not even consulted (this\nis true of the writings by Las Casas as well as those by Sepu\u00b4lveda). Castro\u2019s\nassessment of the legal and intellectual impact of the Dominican is particularly\npatchy \u2013 his influence on the university professor Fray Juan de la Pen\u02dca, for example,\nor the way in which that Jose\u00b4 de Acosta\u2019s work was in some ways a reaction to his\nlegacy, are entirely ignored. The complexity of the positions defended within the\nmissionary movement is not conveyed to the reader either, which makes it difficult to\nevaluate Las Casas according to the criteria of his contemporaries. It also seems\nunfair to accuse Las Casas of assuming an imperial model whilst seeking to blunt its\nbrutal effects on the natives. He did not simply take for granted a metropolitan\ninterest, but in fact examined its legal justification and denounced its mechanisms of\nviolent exploitation quite thoroughly, developing ever more radical proposals in a\nspiral of imperial self-criticism that finds few historical parallels. As for the idea that\nLas Casas should have realised that it was contradictory to seek to impose an alien\nreligion \u2018on a people who already had well-defined theological beliefs \u2019, it is of course\ndeeply anachronistic, revealing a worrying lack of capacity for historical sympathy.\nCastro\u2019s valid points, one may conclude, are poorly served by an argument that\ntends to privilege the facile polemic around the myths of the Black and Golden\nLegends of the Spanish empire in the New World. This is particularly surprising\nwhen the author began by proclaiming his intentions to move beyond the\nmythological dimensions of the friar\u2019s legacy. In fact his book will be most useful to\nstudents new to the subject and interested in ideological debates. By contrast, serious\nscholars will find little that is new.\nJOAN-PAU RUBIE\u00b4SLONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE\n768 JOURNAL OF ECCLES IA ST ICAL H I STORY\n"}
