One aspect that has not been examined is academics\u201f perceptions of particular \nteaching methods. In this study, academics\u201f accounts of tutorials at the University of Oxford \nwere used as an \u201eideal type\u201f in order to examine whether there is variation in the ways that \nacademics experience a single teaching method. An analysis of interviews with 20 academics \nconstituted four qualitatively different ways in which academics described the purpose of \ntutorials. This paper examines whether there appeared to be systematic subject-based \ndifferences in the ways academics\u201f described tutorials, as well as examining relations \nbetween academics\u201f accounts of tutorials and their approaches to teaching. In doing so, the \nstudy offers insight into the different ways in which academics account for a particular \nteaching and learning task, which has important implications for the approach that is taken to \nsupporting university teaching more generally \n \nKey Words: Tutorials; Academics; Phenomenography; Approaches to Teaching; Teaching \nMethods \n \n  3 \nVariation in Academics\u2019 Accounts of Tutorials \n \nIntroduction  \nThere has been a growing literature over the past fifteen years or so that has examined \nuniversity academics\u201f approaches to, and conceptions, of teaching (for example Martin & \nBalla 1991, Samuelowicz & Bain 1992, Gow & Kember 1993, Trigwell & Prosser 1996). \n\u00c5kerlind (2003) summarises this research and argues that from a range of research \nperspectives these studies have consistently suggested that a key variation in the ways in \nwhich academics approach and conceptualise their teaching is whether they are focused on \ntheir teaching and how they transfer information to students (an information transfer\/ teacher \nfocused approach to teaching) or whether they are focused on their students\u201f learning and \nhow their students develop their conceptual understanding (a conceptual change\/ student \nfocused approach to teaching).  \n \nAcademics\u201f approaches to teaching have also been found to relate to students\u201f approaches to \nlearning. The students of academics who report adopting an information transfer\/teacher \nfocused approach to teaching are more likely to adopt an approach to learning focused on the \nreproduction of information (a surface approach to learning), whereas the students of \nacademics who report adopting a conceptual change\/student focused approach to teaching are \nmore likely to adopt an approach to learning focused on developing a personal understanding \nof the course material (a deep approach to learning) (Gow and Kember 1993, Trigwell et al \n1999, Prosser & Trigwell 1999). This is significant because students who adopt a deep \napproach tend to achieve higher quality learning outcomes than students who adopt a surface \n  4 \napproach to learning (Prosser & Trigwell 1999). Thus there appears to be a relation between \nthe ways in which academics\u201f approach their teaching and the quality of students\u201f learning \noutcomes. \n \nAn important aspect of much of this research is that academics\u201f approaches to teaching are \nrelational (Prosser & Trigwell 1999, \u00c5kerlind 2003), thus, rather than being a relatively \nstable characteristic of an academic, they change according to academics\u201f perceptions of \ntheir situation. Prosser & Trigwell\u201fs (1997) findings suggest that where academics perceive \nthat they have control over what is taught and how it is taught; they perceive that the class \nsize is not too large; and they perceive that their department values teaching; they are more \nlikely to adopt a conceptual change\/student focused approach to teaching.  \n \nOne related aspect of academics\u201f perceptions of their teaching situation that has not been \nexamined is their perception of particular teaching methods, such as lectures, seminars and \ntutorials. The research reported in this paper sought to address this issue through an \nexamination of academics\u201f accounts of tutorials and relating these to academics\u201f approaches \nto teaching more broadly. In this way, the study sought to examine whether there is anything \nintrinsic in a particular method of teaching that leads academics to think about it in a \nconceptual change\/student focused or a information transfer\/teacher focused way, or whether \nthe variation that has been constituted in relation to academics\u201f conceptions of teaching could \nalso be constituted in relation to a particular teaching method. This was investigated because \nwhether or not there is variation in the ways in which academics experience a particular \n  5 \nteaching method has important implications for the ways in which academics are supported \nin developing their teaching. \n \nTutorials at the University of Oxford \nThis study focused on academics\u201f experiences of tutorials at the University of Oxford and \nsought to use this as a way of examining academics\u201f accounts of a particular teaching \nmethod. Tutorials at the University of Oxford are part of a learning system that usually \ninvolves students in a period of intensive individual study, the preparation of some work, \nwhether an essay or completion of a problem sheet, followed by the tutorial itself. Students \nusually have about 3 tutorials a fortnight and report spending about 13 hours preparing for \neach tutorial (Commission of Inquiry 1997).   \n \nWhilst it might be argued that this is such an unusual teaching and learning environment as to \nbe of interest only to those within Oxford, this study sought to use it as an \u201eideal type\u201f in two \nsenses of the phrase. First, it sought to use it as an \u201eideal type\u201f in the sense of an atypical case \nthat could be used to illuminate aspects of academics\u201f experiences of teaching methods more \ngenerally. As Trowler and Turner (2002) argue, there is a long tradition in the social sciences \nof drawing on the heuristic power of the atypical in order to illuminate more common \nsituations. Second, it sought to use it as an \u201eideal type\u201f in the sense that tutorials at the \nUniversity of Oxford can be argued to provide an ideal teaching environment. This is \nbecause the tutorial system has the three features that, Prosser & Trigwell (1997) argued, \nprovide a teaching context that is supportive of a conceptual change\/student focused \n  6 \napproach to teaching i.e. class sizes that are not too large, academics having control over \ntheir teaching, and teaching that is valued by the institution.  \n \nFirst, tutorials at Oxford tend to be relatively small in size with one tutor working with \nbetween one and six students (Commission of Inquiry 1997). The Commission of Inquiry \n(1997) found that the most common size of tutorial was 2 students but that tutorials in social \nsciences, sciences and engineering tended to be bigger than those in the arts.  \n \nSecond, tutors have autonomy in deciding how to structure, and what content to focus on, in \ntutorials (Commission of Inquiry 1997), although a general structure appears to be that there \nwill be an interrogation, whether questioning or discussion, of the work that the students have \ncompleted in preparation for the tutorial (UGC 1964, Moore 1968, Commission of Inquiry \n1997, Tapper & Palfreyman 2000, Palfreyman 2001). This work may be handed in \nbeforehand, in the case of an essay it may be read out in the tutorial, or the tutor may take in \nthe work at the end of the tutorial or not at all. The discussion usually starts with the students \nbeing given the opportunity to ask any questions they have about the subject matter and, \nproceeds from there. \n \nFinally, tutorial teaching is highly valued within the institution. Tapper & Palfreyman (2000 \np.96), for example, refer to the tutorial system as the \u201ejewel in the crown\u201f, whilst \nPalfreyman\u201fs (2001) edited collection offers many accounts of the effectiveness of the \ntutorial system. For example, Shale (2001), in her contribution to this collection, argues that \n  7 \ntutorials at Oxford are student-focused, as they focus on the student developing their \nunderstanding of their both their discipline and of the demands of higher learning: \n  \n\u201cOne of the great strengths of the tutorial system [at Oxford] is that it enables tutors and students \nto engage in dialogue that demands more sophisticated levels of understanding, and suggests new \nconceptions of learning. Tutorial teaching encourages students to make the discovery that higher \nlearning is different from, and demands more of them, than learning as they may previously \nconceived of it\u201d (Shale 2001, p.98) \n \nThis study sought to examine whether these apparently highly supportive conditions \nfor teaching resulted in tutors approaching their teaching in a consistently conceptual \nchange\/student focused way or whether variation existed in tutors\u201f accounts of \ntutorials and, if so, what factors appeared to be related to variation in these accounts. \nAlthough a previous study had examined students\u201f conceptions of tutorials at Oxford \n(Ashwin 2005), and there are commentaries on the purposes of these tutorials (for \nexamples see UGC 1964, Moore 1968, Tapper & Palfreyman 2000, Palfreyman \n2001), there is no previous research which examines the qualitative variation in \nacademics\u201f accounts of tutorials at Oxford, or tutorials more generally. \n \nMethod \nA phenomenographic approach was taken in conducting this research. This is because this \nresearch sought to examine the variation in the ways that a group of academics experienced \ntutorials. As Marton & Booth (1997, p.111) argue, \u201cAt the root of phenomenography lies an \n  8 \ninterest in describing the phenomena in the world as others see them, and in revealing and \ndescribing the variation therein, especially in an educational context\u201d.    \n \nTwenty tutors (T1 to T20) of undergraduate students were interviewed about their experience \nof tutorials at Oxford. In line with other phenomenographic studies (see \u00c5kerlind 2005), the \ntutors were selected to maximise the potential variation in academics\u201f experiences of tutorials \nin terms of discipline, length of tutoring experience and gender rather than to provide a \nrepresentative sample of academics involved with tutoring at Oxford. Two disciplines were \nselected from each of the University\u201fs five divisions (Humanities, Life and Environmental \nSciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Medical Sciences, and Social Sciences) and \ntwo tutors were selected from each of the disciplines. Those interviewed were selected to \nmaximise the variation in experience of tutoring at Oxford. This ranged from 2 years to 40 \nyears experience. Seven of the academics had less than 10 years experience of tutoring at \nOxford, six had between 10 and 19 years experience, and seven had greater than 20 years \nexperience. The average length of experience of tutoring was 16.3 years. Eleven of the tutors \ninterviewed were men and nine were women. \n \nIn the interviews, academics were first asked about their experience of running tutorials \ngenerally, and then asked to describe a particular undergraduate tutorial they had given, from \nany preparation work they had set students through to the tutorial itself. The interviews were \nthen structured around this description, with particular attention paid to what the tutor saw as \nthe purpose of this particular tutorial and how they understood their role, as well as the role \nof student(s), within this tutorial. \n  9 \n \nThe interviews were analysed using a phenomenographic approach (Marton & Booth 1997). \nThe focus was on qualitative variation in the ways in which the tutors experienced tutorials at \nOxford. Categories of description of \u201eways of describing tutorials\u201f were formed by \nexamining the qualitative variation in meaning in tutors\u201f accounts of tutorials and the logical \nrelations between the categories of description. The categories were formed and reformed by \nmoving between these two forms of examination with the aim of constituting a hierarchy of \nempirically grounded and logically consistent categories of description of the different ways \nin which tutors described tutorials. The analysis was carried out by the author, with a \ncolleague who verified that the categories of description could be justified on the basis of \ntranscripts of the interviews.  \n \nA number of things should be noted about the approach to phenomenography adopted in this \nstudy. First, it should also be noted that the outcomes from phenomenographic studies are \nbased on the variation across all of the interview transcripts rather than a categorisation of \neach individual in the study. Thus any one interview may contain more than one of the \ncategories of description constituted in this study. \n \nSecond, it should also be noted that the claim being made about the outcome space is that it \nis constituted in the relation between the researcher and the data (Marton & Booth 1997). \nThus, it is accepted that it is not the only possible outcome that could be constituted from the \ndata. What is important is that the categories can be argued for convincingly on the basis of \nthe data (see \u00c5kerlind 2005 for an analysis of the different approaches taken in \n  10 \nphenomenographic studies). In line with other phenomenographic studies the outcomes in \nthis study were critically examined by an experienced researcher in the field who checked \nthat the construction of the categories was supported by the transcripts. Quotations are also \nprovided under the description of each category in the \u201eResults\u201f section, to allow readers to \nexamine, to a limited extent given the limitations of space, how the transcripts supported the \ncategories. However, it should also be noted that it is the variation between the categories, \nrather than the categories themselves, that are the focus in phenomenography and thus it is \nthe differences between the quotes in the different sections that should be examined and \nquestioned. \n \nThird, as this element of the study is based solely on interview data, it is probably more \naccurate to describe what is constituted as tutors\u201f accounts of tutorials rather than, as is more \ncommon in phenomenographic research, tutors\u201f conceptions (see Richardson 1997, S\u00e4lj\u00f6 \n1997 for a fuller discussion of this). However, as McCune (2004, p.261) argues in relation to \nstudent interviews, if there is evidence that interview analyses can be \u201crelated in meaningful \nways to the outcomes of students\u201f learning\u201d, this provides evidence that interviewees\u201f \naccounts are related to their practice. The Approaches to Teaching Inventory (ATI) (Prosser \n& Trigwell 1999)  was used in this study because academics\u201f accounts of their approaches to \nteaching have been found to relate to measures of the quality of students\u201f learning (Trigwell \net al 1999, Trigwell & Prosser 1999), and thus can provide a link between academics\u201f \naccounts of their teaching and their teaching practice.  \n \n  11 \nThe academics were asked to complete the ATI, at the end of the interview, in relation to the \nsame course that was the focus of the tutorial they had described in the interview. Eighteen of \nthe twenty tutors agreed to complete a copy of the ATI, which contains two scales. The \nInformation Transmission\/Teacher-focused approach (ITTF) scale measures the degree to \nwhich teachers self report adopting an approach to teaching that focuses on the information \nthat they seek to transfer as teachers. The Conceptual Change\/Student-focused approach \n(CCSF) scale measures the degree to which teachers self report focusing on student learning \nas the focus of their activities. Tutors\u201f scores on each of these scales were related to the \nhighest category of ways of describing tutorials that they expressed in their interview. In \ndoing so, this part of the study moves away from a purely phenomenographic approach \nbecause the focus on variation across all of the interview transcripts is replaced by a focus on \nhow the responses of individual tutors can be categorized. As indicated above, this \ncompromise was made in order to allow a link to be made between tutors\u201f accounts of \ntutorials and their teaching practice. Similar compromises were made in comparing tutors\u201f \naccounts of tutorials with their disciplines, their gender, their levels of experience and their \nperceptions of the teaching and learning environment. \n \nResults \nFour qualitatively different ways of describing tutorials were constituted in the analysis of \nthe interviews: \n \n1. Tutorials as a place where tutors help students to develop an understanding of \nconcepts; \n  12 \n2. Tutorials as a place where students see how to approach their discipline; \n3. Tutorials as a place where evidence is critically discussed; \n4. Tutorials as a place where new positions on the topic are developed and refined. \n \nThe qualitatively different descriptions of the tutorial were constituted by different tutor \ndescriptions of the purpose of the particular tutorial discussed, the role of work that was \ncompleted in preparation for the tutorial, and the role of the student and the tutor in this \nparticular tutorial. These dimensions are included in explanations of the categories below. \n1. Tutorials as a place where tutors help students to develop an understanding of concepts \nTutors\u201f accounts consistent with this category described the purpose of tutorials as being to \nhelp students to understand the concepts involved in the topic they were studying and to help \nthe students to see the topic in the way that the tutors did themselves. (It should be noted that \nthe words \u201etopic\u201f and \u201ematerial\u201f are used generically in this paper to denote the body of \nknowledge that is the focus of a particular tutorial). The role of students\u201f preparation work \nwas for the tutor to assess the students\u201f current level of understanding. Under this category, \ntutors\u201f described their role in the tutorial in terms of steering the student towards what they \nwere expected to know. They described the role of the students in terms of engaging with the \ntopic by asking and answering questions and admitting to the tutor what they did not \nunderstand. \n \nThe primary purpose [of the preparation work] is just trying to get a gauge on where we should \nfocus in respect of the tutorial. [My role is] getting them to think about those issues, obviously \ngauging what they are understanding and think about it in a different way to elevate their \nunderstanding\u2026 [I do this in] quite a straight forward way actually in terms of just asking a series \n  13 \nof questions\u2026 and from the answers they\u201fll give, I will then ask them another question which \nshould explore it in that way.  So in a crude sort of way, I guess actually you could say it is more \nlike a quiz, to kind of tease apart their understanding and encourage them by asking themselves \nquestions, and in particular, answer the questions that I\u201fm asking to clarify issues\u2026 But in terms \nof their role, to be quite honest, I am expecting them to come along with motivation, enthusiasm \nand for them to get to grips with the actual material and to engage with it.  \n(T13: Medical Sciences)   \n \nSometimes people would give me good information and I would say \u201eOK, yes, but do you \nunderstand why that\u201fs so?\u201f and we would go through it.  Hopefully they would go \u201eaah, I see it \nnow\u201f and I think that\u201fs what my role is in the tutorial, is to steer them towards what they are \nexpected to know and help them with what they are expected to understand\u2026 The purpose [of \ntutorials] isn\u201ft to make sure they can answer that question; it is to get them thinking about that area \nof the work.  Again, the concept is to straighten their minds so that if they\u201fre asked a different \nquestion, they can apply what they know.  \n(T14: Mathematical and Physical Sciences).   \n \n  14 \n2. Tutorials as a place where students see how to approach their discipline  \nTutors\u201f accounts consistent with this category described the purpose of tutorials as being for \nthe student to develop their thinking within the subject. They described the role of the \npreparation work as being for the student to think about a part of the discipline. They \ndescribed their role as tutors in terms of demonstrating how a member of the discipline \nwould approach the particular topic, whilst the role of the students was to identify problem \nareas and to participate in overcoming these in a way a member of the discipline would.  \nThe qualitative difference between categories 1 and 2 was the disciplinary focus in category \n2. Whereas in category 1, tutors described seeking to steer students towards what they are \nexpected to know, in category 2 what students were expected to know was clearly located \nwithin the discipline, and the tutor\u201fs role was more to demonstrate how those within the \ndiscipline would approach the particular topic rather than helping them to understand \nparticular concepts directly.  \n \n[I give students essays] partly because I think its fair to say that you cannot produce an essay \nwithout having read the material and its partly the need for them to learn how to write scientific \nessays\u2026 I think the most important [role of the tutor] is teaching the student how to think\u2026 I \nthink it\u201fs largely done by example and that\u201fs one of the advantages of getting them to ask \nquestions is that you can then, if you like, demonstrate how to approach answering that question. \nWhich is why I say it\u201fs useful to be able to turn the question back on them and see how well they \napproach it. I think it is quite effective because, remember, I have no knowledge of what questions \nthey will ask so they know I\u201fm answering it cold.  I do try to set out the logical progression of how \nI get to the answer rather than just saying \u201ethe answer is x\u201f. \n(T3: Life and Environmental Sciences).  \n  15 \n \n[Their preparation work has] led them to redevelop most of the main ideas and, if luck will have it, \nmany of those ideas have been covered in lectures beforehand anyway, so they cover the lectures \nand they\u201fre reading. The harder, more interesting things you do in the tutorials . . . Primarily you \ntry to show them strategies for solving a problem, strategies an experienced [member of the \ndiscipline] would bring to bear and you illustrate and I guess you also show humility in a way: \n\u201eDon\u201ft be frightened if you don\u201ft solve it the first time, the connections might be made later\u201f. \n(T10: Mathematical and Physical Sciences).  \n3. Tutorials as a place where evidence is critically discussed \nTutors\u201f accounts consistent with this category described the purpose of tutorials as being to \ndevelop students\u201f critical thinking about the discipline. They described the role of \npreparation work in terms of the student beginning to think critically about the issues that \nwould be discussed in the tutorial. They described their role in the tutorial as being to relate \nthe students\u201f ideas to a wider context, whereas the students\u201f role was to present and critically \ndiscuss the evidence. They indicated that they were not always successful in getting students \nto fully take on this role, as is suggested in the quote from tutor T12 below, but they clearly \nindicated that it was part of the role they expected students to take in the tutorial. \n \nThe qualitative difference between categories 2 and 3 was the focus on the students thinking \ncritically about the topic under discussion in the tutorial. In categories 1 and 2, the focus was \non how the tutor helps the student to understand the topic, whereas the focus in category 3 \nwas on the students developing a critical understanding of the topic. \n \nThe purpose of my firstly giving them essays is to ensure that they come up with not only having \nread things, but having thought about what they can do with the things they have read\u2026 I think \n  16 \nthat\u201fs really it, to make them think critically about what they\u201fve read and try and put it into some \nkind of framework, otherwise it\u201fs just a series of 5-10 things they\u201fve read\u2026 [My role was to act] \nas a sheep dog.  I kind of herded them in and I think a sheep dog is quite a good analogy, rather \nthan a shepherd, as I don\u201ft feel I had specific things that I wanted to get through \u2026 Their role is \nreally to be able to communicate what they\u201fve read, I ask them to summarise what are the three \nkey points they have made in their essay \u2026   Another role that I\u201fm keen to get students to fulfil in \ntutorials is to be critical of what they\u201fve read and I spend a long time in many tutorials trying to \nget people to criticise what they\u201fve read and that can be quite hard going. \n(T12: Life and Environmental Sciences) \n \n [My role is] number one to listen, obviously to correct inaccuracies, that\u201fs what we\u201fre there for.  \nMainly to provide a sounding board for their ideas and to put their ideas into a wider context \u2026 \n[Their role involves] presenting the evidence, discussing the evidence, using the tutor to answer \nthings they haven\u201ft understood or that they want to qualify, and having an occasion where they \ncan practice putting their own point of view \u2026 The essay has the function of trying to get out a \nlarge amount of different information to produce a synthesis, such that they can see what the major \nproblems are, how it should be approached, ones to which there are answers, ones to which there \nare not answers, ones which need looking at and how you can look at them.  \n(T5: Medical Sciences) \n4. Tutorials as a place where new positions on the topic are developed and refined \nTutors\u201f accounts consistent with this category described the purpose of tutorials as being to \ndevelop and refine new positions on the topic being discussed. The role of the preparation \nwork was for the students to develop an initial position on the topic. In this category, tutors \ndescribed their role in terms of providing a context in which students could develop this \ninitial position, and the role of the student was to develop a new, yet still provisional, \nposition.   \n  17 \n \nThe qualitative difference between categories 3 and 4 was that in category 4, the tutors \nfocused on students developing and refining their own positions on the topic being discussed \nas well as thinking critically about established positions on the topic, as was the case in \ncategory 3. Perhaps unsurprisingly, tutors describing tutorials in ways that were consistent \nwith category 4, also described students coming up with ideas that were new to them more \nfrequently than under the other categories. There was also an increased sense that what was \ndeveloped in the tutorial was provisional and would be reviewed and developed as the \nstudents continued their studies.   \n \nIn the tutorial I try to facilitate the discussion and fade into the background as much as I can, again \nit\u201fs one of those things that depends on the students but I normally try to fade into the background \nand facilitate something, to give it a purpose and this is what we are thinking about. I bring the \nconversation back on course if it strays too far away from the basic structure\u2026 [the students] have \nto speak out and assume some kind of responsibility for contributing to the discussion and they get \nto think out loud and they get to interact with another opinion, take that opinion, think about it and \ncome up with an original response . . . In this particular context, the main role of tutorials is for \nstudents to be able to express themselves in a particular way, to be able to introduce their own \nthoughts on the subject and be able to interact with other students. As a student, you get an \nopportunity to contribute something of your own to the subject.  \n(T7: Social Sciences). \n \nI think predominantly [my role is] to bring people out of themselves and allow them to experiment \nwith ideas\u2026 [Their role is] to come along, certainly, with an agenda with some kind of trajectory \nthrough what they\u201fd been reading and, ideally, to come along with some questions. Again to \nembrace the sense of provisionality, to say \u201eI\u201fm happy with this idea but I\u201fm still not happy how \n  18 \nthese two things connect. What do you think of them?\u201f Not even to look for the answer but to look \nat another view and, yes, to come along with that sense of something being consolidated.  \u201eI\u201fve \ndone some reading, I\u201fve looked at some areas and I have a sense of what\u201fs going on but also \nthings are still provisional\u201f. I always talk about the etymology of an \u201eessay\u201f being \u201eto essai\u201f, to try \nand not to prove or to accomplish, but simply to try to tie something together in one way and I \nwould like the students to leave with a sense that they would write a different essay, not just in the \nlight of what I might have said but also what the others might have said. \n(T 6: Humanities). \n  \nRelations between the categories \nThe qualitatively different descriptions can be logically related to each other in terms of a \nreferential (meaning) aspect and a structural aspect. The referential aspect characterizes the \ncategories in terms of what the tutorials described mean. In this case the referential aspect is \ndifferentiated in terms of whether tutorials are seen as being about engagement, critical \nengagement, or the development of new positions. The structural aspect characterizes the \ncategories in terms of what is in the foreground and background in each category. In this \ncase, the structural aspect is differentiated according to whether concepts or the discipline are \nfore-grounded in each category. Table 1 summarises the referential and structural aspects of \neach of categories of description.   \n \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe referential and structural aspects form an inclusive hierarchy with each new category \nsubsuming and building on the previous aspect and in this way the four categories form an \ninclusive and expanding hierarchy. Thus category 4 includes categories 1 to 3 but category 1 \n  19 \ndoes not include any of the other categories. However, it should be noted that the outcome \nspace does not represent a developmental hierarchy as claimed by Webb (1997), in that there \nis no suggestion that academics necessarily move through the different categories of tutorials \nas they learn more about tutoring. Rather it is argued that tutors\u201f experiences of tutorials \nchange according to their perception of the learning and teaching environment and their \nperceptions of the nature of the subject taught.  \n \nRelations between tutors\u2019 accounts of tutorials and their perceptions of the teaching and \nlearning environment \nThe four ways of describing tutorials outlined above show a shift from category 1, which \nfocuses on the tutor helping the students to understand concepts, to category 4, which focuses \non students developing new positions within the discipline being discussed.  The four \ncategories do not represent an unchanging style that tutors use to approach tutorials but \nrather, as with approaches to teaching (Prosser & Trigwell 1999), appeared to be related to \ntheir perceptions of the situation in which they were tutoring.  \n \nObviously, with only 20 tutors in the sample, caution is required when reporting these \nrelations. However, that said, a number of factors appeared to be related to the highest \ncategory of tutorials that was consistent with tutors\u201f accounts of tutorials. As is shown in \nTable 2, there appeared to be some relation between disciplines and the categories of tutorials \nthat tutors expressed in their interview. The tutors who appeared to express experiencing \ntutorials in a way that was congruent with category 1 were all from science-based disciplines, \nwhilst the tutors who experienced tutorials in a way that was congruent with category 4 were \n  20 \nfrom disciplines within the humanities and social sciences. However, there was also variation \nwithin disciplines with tutors from the same discipline describing tutorials in qualitatively \ndifferent ways (i.e. in ways consistent with different categories) in 6 out of 10 of the \ndisciplines. In three disciplines, there was a difference of two categories between the tutors\u201f \naccounts\u201f of tutorials.  \n \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThere appeared to be no relation between tutors\u201f levels of tutoring experience and the ways \nin which they described tutorials, and no relation between tutors\u201f sex and the higher category \nconsistent with their accounts of tutorials. \n \nThere was some limited qualitative evidence of a link between tutors\u201f perceptions of the \nteaching context and their account of tutorials. Where tutors felt a large amount of content \nneeded to be covered within the tutorial, where tutors perceived this material to be complex, \nand where the tutorial was in close proximity to an examination on the topic, tutors tended to \ndescribe tutorials in ways which were consistent with the lower categories of ways of \ndescribing tutorials. For example, T7 mentioned another course that T7 taught, in which \nsome of these factors affected the approach that was taken in the tutorials. By way of contrast \nsome of T7\u201fs quotes cited above (under category 4) are included: \n \nIn this particular context, the main role of tutorials is for students to be able to express themselves \nin a particular way to be able to introduce their own thoughts on the subject and be able to interact \nwith other students. As a student, you get an opportunity to contribute something of your own to \n  21 \nthe subject. \u2026 [With this other course] they have to do well in the examinations. This is one \nconstraint. The structure of the course, it\u201fs about coverage. You have to cover a hell of a lot. That \nis a constraint. I still try to do a similar thing but there are differences. There is more of an issue \nthat they understand detail\u2026 I have to be more goal orientated. I know that there are five \nsubstantial points that they have to emerge with: a), b), c) d) e). It has huge coverage and they are \nexamined on it.  \n(T7: Social Sciences)   \n \nRelations between tutors\u2019 accounts of tutorials and their approaches to teaching  \nThere appeared to be a relation between tutors\u201f accounts of tutorials and their approaches to \nteaching as measured by the ATI.  \n \nTABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 3 shows that as the highest category consistent with a tutor\u201fs account increased, so \ntheir ITTF approach score fell and their CCSF approach score increased. This suggests that, \nfor this small sample of tutors, the higher the category of ways of describing tutorials that \nwas consistent with their account, the more likely they were to focus on student learning and \nthe less likely they were to focus on their role in terms of information transfer in their \napproach to teaching that particular tutorial.  \n \nDiscussion \nThis study constituted variation in the ways that tutors describe tutorials. Tutors\u201f accounts of \ntutorials ranged from tutors describing tutorials as a place where they help students to \ndevelop an understanding of concepts to tutors describing tutorials as a place where new \n  22 \npositions on the topic are developed and refined. The highest category of ways of describing \ntutorials consistent with a tutor\u201fs account of tutorials appeared to be related to their \ndiscipline, and their approaches to teaching. There was also evidence that suggested a \nrelation between their accounts of tutorials and their perceptions of their teaching and \nlearning environment. Finally, there was evidence of a relation between the highest category \nof tutorials that tutors expressed and their approaches to teaching those tutorials.  The higher \nthe category of ways of describing tutorials that tutors accounts were consistent with, the \nhigher their conceptual change \/student-focused score and the lower their information \ntransfer\/ teacher-focused score on the ATI.  \n \nSo what does this tell us about academics\u201f approaches to particular teaching methods more \ngenerally? Despite the apparently favourable conditions (tutor autonomy in what and how to \nteach, small class sizes, in an environment where teaching is valued) offered by tutorials at \nOxford, there was still qualitative variation in the ways these academics talked about \ntutorials. Whilst these differences appeared to be related to academics\u201f disciplines, there were \nalso differences within disciplines. These differences seem to suggest that, in line with \nProsser & Trigwell (1999), and Prosser et al (2003) it is academics\u201f perceptions of their \nteaching environment, rather than the environment per se, that appeared to influence how \nthey approached their teaching.  \n \nThis finding has two important implications for the way in which university academics are \nsupported in improving their teaching. First, the finding that academics appear to have \nqualitatively different accounts of a single teaching method suggests that academic \n  23 \ndevelopment which focuses on helping academics to increase their repertoire of teaching \nmethods (which Gibbs & Coffey 2000 and Coffey & Gibbs 2002 report is a goal of many \ntraining programmes for university teachers throughout the world) without examining their \nways of accounting for their teaching are unlikely to be highly effective. This is because this \nstudy provides evidence that different academics approach similar teaching methods \ndifferently depending on the ways in which they think about those teaching methods. Thus, it \nseems plausible that academics re-interpret different teaching methods according to their \nways of thinking about teaching and learning.   \n \nSecond, this study constituted variation in academics\u201f accounts of one particular teaching \nmethod, tutorials at the University of Oxford. There were also relations between these \nacademics\u201f accounts of this teaching method and their approaches to teaching. Given there is \nevidence in other contexts of a link between academics\u201f approaches to teaching and the \nquality of their students\u201f learning (Trigwell et al 1999, Prosser et al 2003), this provides \nsome limited evidence that helping academics to develop more sophisticated ways of \nthinking about particular teaching tasks may be a way to support them in improving the \nlearning of their students.   \n \nHowever, as the first to examine academics\u201f accounts of a particular teaching method, this \nstudy had a number of potential limitations. First, although the sample was selected to be \nlarge enough to maximise the variation in academics\u201f accounts of tutorials, it was not \nselected in a way that makes the results generalisable. Nevertheless, the relation between \nacademics\u201f accounts of tutorials and their approaches to teaching, does offer some support \n  24 \nfor the validity of the categories constituted because the approaches to teaching inventory has \nbeen found to be reliable in a number of contexts and amongst large numbers of university \nacademics (Prosser and Trigwell 1999, p.156, Prosser et al 2003).   \n \nAnother potential limitation of this study was the cross-disciplinary focus on tutorials that \nwas taken. The finding that academics who experienced tutorials in a way that is congruent \nwith category 1 were all from science-based disciplines, whilst those who experienced \ntutorials in line with category 4 were from the social sciences and humanities, raises the \nquestion of whether it is possible to treat \u201etutorials\u201f as a single entity across different \ndisciplines. There are two responses to this. The first is that, as indicated in Table 2, there \nwas variation across broad discipline areas in a way that suggested there was an overlap \nbetween tutorials in different disciplines. The second response is that this is an area that is \nsuitable as subject for further research, which could offer a deeper insight into the meaning of \ntutorials in different disciplines.  \n \nTo return to the Oxford context, this study has suggested that there is qualitative variation in \nthe ways that academics account for tutorials at Oxford. The variation in academics\u201f accounts \nof tutorials appeared to be related to their approaches to teaching, which in other contexts \nhave been found to relate to the quality of students\u201f learning. This suggests that, even within \na teaching and learning environment that many would consider to be ideal, unless academics \nare focused on the learning of their students rather than their own performance, their teaching \nmay act as a barrier to high quality student learning. \n  \n  25 \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to thank Keith Trigwell for his contribution to this paper in terms of his \ninvolvement in verifying the analysis of the interviews and discussing the ideas contained in \nthe paper.
