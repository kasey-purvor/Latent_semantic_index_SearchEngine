While there is no direct link to any instrumentation\nproject at this stage, this development of new techniques will enable solutions\nfor future projects as KMOS, NIRSPEC IFU or MOMSI.\n1 Author contact: jurgen.schmoll@durham.ac.uk, Tel. 0044-(0)191-334-4810\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science 5 February 2008\n2 Image slicer optics\nOver the past few years image slicing IFUs have become increasingly popular,\nand in many applicatins they are a preferable choice to lenslet or fiber-lenslet\ndesigns. Advantages over the fiber-lenslet IFUs include higher efficiency, com-\npact size and a high degree of automatization in manufacture that enables\nmuch larger numbers of spatial elements than fiber-lenslet IFUs. Problems\nto tackle deal with the fact that slicer IFUs are difficult in the context of\nsmall reflective surfaces of complicated shape being next to each other. While\na sandwich of optically polished surfaces suffers from misalignment and er-\nror buildup, the monolithic approach means the elements cannot be produced\nby classical optical manufacture. After the successful commissioning of the\nGNIRS IFU in 2003 (2), carrying mirror arrays machined into a monolithic\naluminium block, the efforts are now focused in optimizing the manufacture\nto get smoother surfaces without losing the advantage of machine controlled\nsurface generation. Efforts are made on metal and glass pieces to explore the\ncapabilities of the different materials. As shown in table 1 (5; 7), the choice of\nthe best surface threatment depends not only on material and handling issues,\nbut on the required removal rate and the surface roughness needed.\nTable 1\nRemoval rates and final surface roughness of different surface generation methods.\nProcess Material removal Typical roughness\nrate [mm\n3\ns\n] [nm rms]\nFixed abrasive grinding 10 103\nSingle point diamond machining 10 .. 50 10..102\nMagneto-Rheological polishing 0.001 3..5\nIon Beam figuring 0.003 0.1..1\n2.1 Metal micro optics\nThe effort in metal optics generation focuses on two different techniques. At\nfirst, the precision of diamond machining using ultra-high precision (UHP) ma-\nchines depends on various parameters such as machine setup, tool type and\nmaterial being machined. The CfAI uses a Nanotech 350FG 5-axis UHP ma-\nchine to create free form surfaces to nanometer precision. Suitable metrology\nequipment allows the quick measurement of the workpieces roughness (ZYGO\nwhite light interferometer) and shape (non contacting profilometer, FISBA\nphase shifting interferometer). The second technique is the replication of metal\n2\nimage slicer optics, being studied within the EU FP6 OPTICON Smart Fo-\ncal Planes network (see Optical replication techniques for image slicers within\nthese proceedings).\n2.2 Glass micro optics\nDue to the different properties of glass when being ground or polished, tests\nhave also been started on glass optics. One goal is the construction of a full\nworking glass slicer IFU, using monolithic optic arrays for the pupil and slit\nmirrors. Apart from this, the roughness improvement of ground free-form sur-\nfaces is subject to tests of post-polishing techniques to remove the residuals\nof the grinding process.\n2.2.1 Partly monolithic architecture:\nThis glass slicer IFU prototype consists of monolithic Zerodur parts for the\npupil and slit mirror arrays (see fig. 1), produced by free-form grinding. The\nslicing mirror array is made from single blanks to maintain a fill factor near\nto 100 %. The stack of blanks is assembled to a jig (see fig. 2, left), allowing\nconventional grinding and polishing of a spherical surface before sliding the\ndifferent slices into final alignment. Critical issues are the precision of the\nground datum surfaces of the blanks, their thickness and the flatness of the\ncorresponding, diamond machined jig surfaces. In their final position the slices\nare held in place by clamp tension of the jig that becomes part of the IFU.\nFig. 1. Pupil (below) and slit (above) mirror arrays of the prototype glass IFU.\n3\nFig. 2. Schematic slicing mirror assembly (left) and complete prototype concept.\n2.2.2 Surface smoothening:\nThis approach focuses on post-polishing processes, reducing surface roughness\nwhile maintaining the optical figure. The goal is to treat complete arrays after\nthe optical surfaces have been ground to their nominal optical shape. For\nthe experiments, flat Schott Zerodur test parts have been diamond ground to\nroughness values of 10 to 20 nm rms. Three different smoothing techniques\nare under investigation:\nIon-beam etching: After spin-coating the surface using SiO2, it is treated\nin an ion beam that ablates the coating with the same rate as the substrate.\nHence, the smoother surface of the coating is transferred into the substrate\n(5). Initial tests by IOM 2 revealed that the roughness could be reduced\nfrom 20..25 nm rms to about 4 nm rms on small sampling areas, albeit the\ndiamond tool marks are still visible using an atomic force microscope.\nLiquid jet polishing: Developed and applied by TNO 3 , a controlled jet of\npolishing liquid removes surface irregularities. Currently TNO uses a con-\nverted polishing machine to test this technique on the Zerodur test pieces.\nMagneto-rheological jet polishing (MR-JET): Another type of liquid\njet polishing where the abrasive particles are oriented by means of a mag-\nnetic field that also allows a better beam control (3). Tests have been done\nby QED 4 , indicating a roughness improvement by about a factor of two.\nA side-by-side comparision of these techniques will allow a determination of\nthe most suitable one for smoothening out the residual roughness produced by\nthe diamond grinding. These techniques will possibly allow an expansion of the\nIFU application to visual wavelength using partly monolithic slicer hardware.\n2 IOM Institute for Surface Modification, Leipzig, Germany\n3 TNO Delft, The Netherlands\n4 QED Technologies, Rochester NY., USA\n4\n3 New microlens array developments\nThe CfAI has designed and built several fiber-lenslet IFUs, amongst them re-\ncently two for the GMOS spectrographs for both Gemini telescopes (1) and\nthe 2000 element IFU for the IMACS spectrograph of the Magellan-I telescope\n(6). In all cases during construction the performance of the epoxy-on-glass mi-\ncrolens arrays used was degraded by scatter, hence a selection had to be made\nby purchase of more arrays than actually needed. The roughness of the lens\nsurfaces was between 40 and 210 nm rms, hence easily visible in a micro-\nscope and causing significant light scatter. Using the CfAI UHP machine, the\ntooling for new microlens arrays can now be done in-house, reducing costs\ndramatically and allowing variations of the lenslet types and materials. To\nimprove the quality of microlens arrays, tool production is planned for epoxy\non glass arrays as well as for monolithic glass molding processes. This will\nallow a tradeoff between both types of microlens architecture. In addition the\nmonolithic glass approach allows a larger wavelength coverage, and a higher\ntemperature stability is expected, being important for cryogenic use.\nAnother problem of fiber-lenslet coupling is the possible cross-talk between\nadjacent elements, caused by borderline effects and diffraction. If one element\nis illuminated by a bright source, this will cause spikes in four (see (4)) or six\ndirections, depending on the lenslet shape whether square or hexagonal. In a\nregular fiber lenslet coupling pattern this light can enter adjacent fibers. Al-\ntough the effect is small, it becomes critical where dim sources next to bright\nsources are to be observed, as in spectroscopy of QSO host galaxies, circum-\nstellar disks or possibly extrasolar planets. To avoid this while maintaining\nthe fill factor and regular spatial sampling, so-called dithered lenslet arrays\nhave been designed to assure that a spike will miss the first and second neigh-\nbour on each side (fig. 3). A suitable fiber-lenslet coupling causes the fiber to\nact as a filter, rejecting spikes coming from the third neighbour and beyond\nbecause the angle of incidence is beyond the numerical aperture of the fiber.\nThis condition is met if equation (1) is fulfilled: The numerical aperture (NA)\nselection depends on the microlens focal ratio N and the refractive index n0\noutside the fiber. For example, using f\/10-lenslets in a monolithic block of\nn0 = 1.5 with the fibers index-matched to it, the maximum NA is 0.36. As the\nmost commonly used step-index fibers have NA values about 0.22, the filter\nwill work for a wide range of applications.\nNA \u2264 n0 sin\n(\narctan\n(\n2.5\nN\n))\n(1)\nAs shown in fig. 3, three different lenslet types are required. For square lenslets\nthere are one concentric and two similar off axis lenses turned by 180\u25e6 with\nrespect to each other. In the hexagon case, one off-axis type is needed for\nthree subsequent orientations, differing in rotation angle by 120\u25e6. Using this\n5\ntiling method, in every spike direction the next two neighbours do not see\nthe spikes. Manufacture of monolihic arrays of these types is possible using\nfreeform generators like the CfAI UHP machine mentioned above. The produc-\ntion of normal and dithered lenslet arrays by the slow tool servo technique has\nbeen simulated successfully. The next step will be the manufacture of lenslet\narray masters being used for epoxy-on-glass types as well as for monolithic\nglass arrays.\n(i) (ii)\n1 2 3 1\n2 3 1 2\n3 1 2 3\n1 2 3 1\n(iii)\n(v)\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1 1 1\n1 11\n3 3 3\n2 2 2\n2 2 2\n1 2 3\n(iv)\n(vi)\n(viii)\n(vii)\nFig. 3.
