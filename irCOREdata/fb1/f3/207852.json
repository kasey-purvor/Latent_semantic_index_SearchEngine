I want to think about Big Brother not as production or text, but as event \nstretched across multiple sites, an \u2018instant condensation\u2019 (Maffesoli, 1993: xv) of \nparticipation which was also an insistent representation of participation, in short, a \nmedia event. Since media events depend for their intensity in part on our sense of \ntheir uniqueness, they are subject to the law of diminishing returns; it is therefore the \nfirst of any Big Brother series that is the obvious place to focus the analysis. \n \nTo analyse media events, we need a broader theoretical framework. Once we accept, \nwith Raymond Williams (1975: 9), that part of television\u2019s power is to provide us \nwith \u2018images of what living is now like\u2019, then we must see television as the focus of \nconflicts over what images of the social world come to seem self-evident (cf \nBourdieu, 1990), as the site, in other words, of a massive concentration of symbolic \npower with all the ritual dimensions that flow from that. Now, more than two decades \nafter Williams wrote, when a significant sector of media production (not only \ntelevision, but also the Web) is devoted exclusively to the display of \u2018ordinary\u2019 \nreality, such a ritual-based analysis is all the more urgent. Here, in schematic form, I \nwant to explore the potential of that approach.  \n \n 2\nThe point is not to interpret BBUK1 as text and from there draw conclusions about \nBritish society (it is a fallacy to take texts for slices of social action). The aim is to \nexplore how BBUK1, as event, made sense from the perspective of certain theories of \nthe media\u2019s ritual dimensions, including my own (Couldry, 2000a and forthcoming, \n2002). BBUK1 is simply one test of whether, and how far, such theories are useful. \n \nBrief Theoretical Background \n \nIn their pioneering study of mediated public events, Daniel Dayan and Elihu Katz \n(1992) argued that only by drawing on the wider field of anthropological theory could \nmedia analysis deal adequately with processes as complex as the broadcasting of \nPresident Kennedy\u2019s funeral in 1963. In such cases, an event that was already of \nmajor public significance was transformed in certain analysable ways by being \nmediated. It was amplified, retextualised, transposed onto other dimensions where its \nsignificance could be debated or contested. In short, as Dayan and Katz memorably \nput it, television \u2018deepens the play\u2019 (1992: 186), where \u2018play\u2019, following Victor \nTurner, has the serious sense of a process, framed apart from the normal flow of \neveryday life, in which society can reflect upon itself.  \n \nSerious play is, in one respect, the successor to, not an example of, rituals based in \norganised religion (Turner 1992: 124), but in a broader sense such play \u2013 and the \nmedia events that focus it \u2013 still constitutes ritual, but in another register.1 It \ncontributes, as Roger Silverstone had already argued (1981, 1988), drawing on \nDouglas (1984: 63-64), to the ritual frame through which society\u2019s members address \nthe central meanings and values that they share. Television\u2019s role in our social and \n 3\nindividual lives is above all as the frame through which we gain access to what is \nmarked off as social, from the merely individual. Media events are simply the most \ncondensed and organised instances of a wider process whereby the media (television, \nbut also radio and the press) are instituted and reinstituted as the place where we look \nfor the reality we call \u2018social\u2019: this is the \u2018framing\u2019 dimension of media power \n(Couldry, 2000a: 42-44).  \n \nIn this way, through the link to a more pervasive framing process, we can apply the \nconcept of \u2018media event\u2019 beyond the liminal social dramas on which Dayan and \nKatz\u2019s discussion (following Victor Turner) was based. \u2018Media events\u2019 are processes \nthrough which society \u2018takes cognizance of itself\u2019 (Turner, 1974: 239), or rather \nappears to do so. Media events need not therefore comprise major social crises, but \nthat is not to collapse them into Boorstin\u2019s (1961) dismissive category of \u2018pseudo-\nevents\u2019. \n \nThis approach to media events in terms of their significance for society\u2019s central \nvalues, indeed our sense of ourselves as belonging to a social order at all, derives \ndirectly from Emile Durkheim\u2019s classic work on the social basis of religion \n(Durkheim, 1995). As I argue in more detail elsewhere (Couldry, 2000a and \nforthcoming 2002) we can draw on this Durkheimian line of argument without \nadopting its accompanying functionalism. The qualification I just added \u2013 \u2018or appears \nto do so\u2019 \u2013 is crucial. A key point, on which Durkheim is silent and on which in \nadapting Durkheim we need to place special emphasis, is that in contemporary \nsocieties, dominated by mass media, all, or almost all, our experiences of \u2018framing\u2019 \nare mediated, not face to face, and therefore pass through institutional mechanisms of \n 4\nrepresentation, that inevitably involve biases, some more serious than others. The \nmedia which any society happens to have tend to be naturalised as its ritual frame \nonto the social, so that the distortions built into that particular institutionalisation are \nnaturalised away, beneath the sight-line of political or social conflict. The media\u2019s \nauthority is a construction. This is not, however, to deny that sometimes conflicts can \narise about the media\u2019s authority to represent \u2018the world\u2019, only that it is rare for this to \nhappen explicitly. So, in applying the language of \u2018ritual\u2019 and \u2018framing\u2019 to BBUK1, I \nam not suggesting that this media event \u2018functioned\u2019 unproblematically to affirm the \nsocial, let alone that it is to be praised for bringing Britain together as a nation! The \npoint of drawing on Durkheim is rather to make clear how high the stakes are when \ntelevision claims to show \u2018reality\u2019. \n \nThose stakes have been complicated by recent reworkings of Durkheim that \nemphasise not so much \u2018society\u2019s\u2019 capacity to unite around a single experience of \u2018the \nsocial\u2019, but rather more local \u2018socialities\u2019 where people discover what they have in \ncommon. This is the seemingly fragmentary, but durably connected social space of \nMichel Maffesoli\u2019s Time of the Tribes, cemented by its shared \u2018aesthetic of the \u201cwe\u201d\u2019 \n(1996: 12). According to Maffesoli, the forms of social togetherness are no longer \nknown in advance, but are constantly sought after, and achieved, often in relatively \nsmall-scale settings. For all its faults,2 Maffesoli\u2019s vision of a social space dominated, \nfor good or ill, by an \u2018aesthetic of the \u201cwe\u201d\u2019 \u2013 that is, the search for contexts where we \ncan see ourselves in terms of what we share \u2013 is as useful a starting-point as any for \nanalysing BBUK1 the event.  \n 5\n \nThree Lines of Analysis \n \nThe \u2018Live\u2019 Event \n \n\u2018Big Brother will be watching, but then who won\u2019t?\u2019 \nDavina McColl, BBUK live presenter, broadcast 18 August 2000 \n \nAll media events need the quality of \u2018liveness\u2019. It is their liveness that enables distant \nmedia audiences to get the sense that they are following a event from within (Dayan \nand Katz, 1992: 115). The liveness of an event does not require that every element of \nit is broadcast live, but rather the belief that, taken together, the media consumption \nprovide shared, but privileged access to the event as it unfolds. (Other media\u2019s \ncommentary on what has \u2018just\u2019 happened, or anticipation of what is about to happen, \nalso contribute to the sense of a televised \u2018live\u2019 event.) Indeed liveness is not a simple \nfact, but a \u2018conventional expectation\u2019 (Saenz, 1994: 576), an assumption of \ntogetherness that the media work hard to construct.3 \n \nThe media\u2019s work in constructing BBUK1 as a large-scale \u2018live\u2019 event was apparent. \nMost obvious were the Friday night television broadcasts when viewers\u2019 votes on who \nwas to be evicted from the house that week were announced. These shows were full of \nclaims that everyone was watching, deciding and voting \u2018now\u2019: precisely the \n\u2018ideology of liveness\u2019 (Feuer, 1983). Important also was accompanying press \ncoverage of BBUK1\u2019s progress as news. Most striking, however - as confirmation of \nhow \u2018liveness\u2019 is a construction across a variety of media \u2013 was the role of the \n 6\nBBUK1 Website, where footage from the house was broadcast continuously. It was \nclaimed that live coverage of the series\u2019 most dramatic episode, the expulsion of \n\u2018Nasty Nick\u2019, had the largest ever audience for a Web broadcast in Britain (Guardian, \n18 August 2000, 1). The Website\u2019s \u2018live\u2019 coverage was itself \u2018remediated\u2019 (Bolter and \nGrusin, 1999) and broadcast every hour on the \u2018Global Media Interface\u2019 giant screen \nin London\u2019s Leicester Square; as the BBUK1 Website put it, \u2018this window on the Big \nBrother world will open for 15 minutes every hour of the day\u2019.4 The Website\u2019s \ncentrality to the media event of Nick\u2019s expulsion was striking (Lawson, 2000), but did \nnot stop the television broadcast later being subsequently billed as one of the \u2018top TV \nmoments\u2019 along with the funeral of Princess Diana (Metro, 18 October, 2000, 7).  \n\u2018Liveness\u2019 was here, as elsewhere, a cross-media construction, but BBUK1 was \nsignificant in extending the complexity of cross-media links and in particular the \ncentrality of the Web to those links. This process was intensified during BBUK2, \nwhen a live feed from the house to the digital channel E4 was maintained. \n \nNone of this, however, explains what was the content of BBUK1 as media event. \nHere, unlike in the cases studied by Dayan and Katz, there was no antecedent event of \npublic significance: ten people locked in a compound competing for money is not \nitself of public significance! The only starting-point for analysing the significance of \nwhat happened in the Big Brother house was that television cameras were present. \nHence the importance of television\u2019s presentation of those events underplaying that \nfact, and insisting that, in all their details, those events were not directed for media \npresentation. Ruth Wrigley, BBUK1\u2019s Executive Producer, expressed exactly that \nstrategy: \u2018I wanted it to look live and exciting . . . this was not meant to be a polished \ndrama. We were filming it for real, and it was a virtue of the programme that viewers \n 7\nunderstood that\u2019 (quoted in BBUK1\u2019s official book, Ritchie, 2000: 11, added \nemphasis). Filming it \u2018for real\u2019, paradoxically, meant ensuring that audiences did not \nbelieve that what they watched was just ten people performing for the camera. The \npsychological discourse of the programme (with its resident psychologists) had a role \nhere, since it affirmed the idea (hardly uncontestable!) that submitting ten people to \nnational surveillance for two months would reveal their human \u2018reality\u2019. As Wrigley \nput it, \u2018nobody can keep up an act all the time in front of the cameras \u2013 the world was \ngoing to see them [the participants] as they really were\u2019 (quoted, Ritchie, 2000: 26), a \n\u2018truth\u2019 curious enough to need underwriting by the psychologists\u2019 \u2018expert\u2019 opinion. As \nthe programme\u2019s official book put it without irony, the aim was that BBUK1 \u2018should \nnot just show what went on in the house, but should explore human relationships with \nthe help of top psychologists\u2019 (Ritchie, 2000: 9). \n \nSo both BBUK1\u2019s \u2018liveness\u2019, and the idea that its liveness mattered, were complex \nconstructions, and both constructions depended in different ways on mediation (the \npresence of cameras and the presence of a large national audience). It was not \nsurprising, therefore, that representations of BBUK1 as media event (\u2018tonight the \nwhole nation will be watching and deciding\u2019)5 were a significant part of its content.  \n \nMedia\/ordinary \n \n\u2018All that\u2019s left [after the end of the series] is the door through which the ten \ncontestants arrived as unknown faces and left again as Britain\u2019s latest celebrities.\u2019 \nHeat, 23-29 September 2000, 10 \n \n 8\nNone of this is to deny that BBUK1 had content beyond its self-confirmations as \nmedia event. It was entertaining and intriguing to watch the contradictions in \ncontestants\u2019 performances, as they passed from mediated front-stage (in front of the \nother contestants, that is) to mediated back-stage (in the diary room, nominating the \nnext evictee, but before a deferred audience of millions), and then returned to the \ngeneral house space once more. But, we might ask, so what? None of this would \njustify treating BBUK1 as a media event.  \n \nThere were two further factors, however, contributing to BBUK1\u2019s event-like status, \neach distinct from the details of the programme\u2019s footage: first, the media\u2019s \nunderlying authority to represent reality and, second, the hierarchy between media \npeople (including celebrities) and non-media (\u2018ordinary\u2019) people (on their \ninterrelationship, see further Couldry, 2000a, chapter 3).   \n \nThe first factor has been implicit already. The idea that BBUK1 revealed something \nimportant about the realities of human interaction without the camera was clearly a \ncentral claim of the programme, as of all reality television. As the producer of the \nUK\u2019s most recent success in this genre, Popstars, put it: \u2018it\u2019s not just an entertainment \nshow, it\u2019s a real life drama\u2019.6 Yet this idea  - that a highly artificial mediated setting \nsuch as BBUK1 could reveal something significant about human interaction off \ncamera \u2013 is not obviously plausible. What underwrote this belief \u2013 in so far as it was \nheld (on which see below) \u2013 was not only the \u2018expert\u2019 psychological opinion already \nmentioned, but something more fundamental: the naturalised belief that the media are \nthe frame through which we normally access social reality. Without that wider \nframework of belief, the narrative authority of the programme would, I suggest, have \n 9\ncollapsed under its own weight. Paradoxically it was the very \u2018ordinariness\u2019 of what \nthe Big Brother cameras showed us that confirmed the wider authority of television to \nrepresent \u2018our\u2019 reality: in so far as it was \u2018ordinary\u2019, this was the reality that would \nexist without the media being there. \n \n\u2018Ordinariness\u2019 is indeed what the media frequently claim to show us: indeed, \nBBUK1\u2019s was \u2018the first time in Britain that ordinary people had been observed right \nround the clock\u2019 (Ritchie, 2000: 8). That is why it was so important for BBUK1\u2019s \nproducers to claim that those entering the world of the show carried no prior traces of \nthe media world.  This is the best explanation for the otherwise draconian rule that \nanyone who even mentioned to the media their forthcoming appearance on the \nprogramme was automatically expelled from it (Ritchie, 2000: 28). How else could \nthe \u2018ordinariness\u2019 of the show\u2019s reality be guaranteed? (It was for the same reason, \nparadoxically, that the charity fundraising Celebrity Big Brother series, also broadcast \nin 2001, seemed less successful to many. With celebrities, not \u2018ordinary people\u2019 as \ninmates of the house, it was much less clear what was being \u2018revealed\u2019 during or at \nthe climax of the game: we know, of course. that celebrities are in fact \u2018ordinary\u2019, and \nthere was no excitement in seeing a celebrity confirm their existing celebrity status by \nwinning the game.  \n \nYet, and here we move to the second factor which underwrote BBUK\u2019s status as \nmedia event, it was precisely the transition from \u2018ordinary\u2019 (non-media) person to \ncelebrity (media) person that was the purpose of the game. This was the master-fame \nwithout which the game made no sense, even if during the game contestants tended \nnot to talk about it. Most contestants were explicit about wanting to enter the media \n 10\nworld (Ritchie, 2000: 34, 36, 40, 44, 77); and no one who watched the Friday night \nshows when the evictee emerged from the studio to a tunnel of cheering fans \u2013 let \nalone the final night of the series with its large stage, live video links, press \nphotographers, celebrity endorsements, and so on \u2013 was left in any doubt that the \ntransition to celebrity was the culmination of the programme\u2019s plot.  \n \nCelebrity \u2013 the hierarchy between media people and non-media people \u2013 is more \nobviously contestable than the media\u2019s status as the authoritative source of social \nrepresentations. Celebrity entrenches the boundary between those in the media and \nthose who aren\u2019t: that boundary was vividly acted out when on BBUK1\u2019s final night \nthe winners during a celebrity-style interview were linked live to friends and \nacquaintances at various locations. Darren (who came third) was shown the \u2018lollipop \nlady\u2019 who helped him across the road as a child. He couldn\u2019t remember her, which \nwas perhaps the point: to show the stereotype of social \u2018ordinariness\u2019, viewed from \nthe stage of celebrity, and thereby confirm the distance which Darren had crossed.  \n \nAt least two strategies, however, were adopted to \u2018soften\u2019 the media\/ordinary \nhierarchy: first, to insist that all participants had become celebrities (all appeared in \nthe final programme on stage); and, second, to highlight other narratives which \nmasked the transition to celebrity, in particular the touching story of the participants \nreturning to their family and close friends. Yet it would be strange to conclude from \nthis that the series simply affirmed \u2018ordinary life\u2019. Even a quick glance at the \ncontestants confirmed that they had been pre-selected for their conformity to the \nconventions of media people\u2019s appearance. Once again the BBUK1 official book is \ndisarmingly candid. Anyone aged 45 or over was excluded, or rather, as one \n 11\npsychologist employed by the programme put it euphemistically, \u2018they weren\u2019t ruled \nout, but we had to examine their motives with particular care\u2019, why this was ever \nnecessary remaining unexplained. Those with what were judged psychological \nweaknesses were also excluded. The crucial rule was the tautologous one of media-\nfriendliness: \u2018we simply went for people we liked, people who were charismatic, \ninteresting . . .\u2019. 7  The actual discriminations on which the media\u2019s picture of the \nworld is based (particularly, the hierarchy between \u2018media people\u2019 and \u2018ordinary \npeople\u2019) are here smuggled in by the word \u2018simply\u2019, one of the \u2018small words\u2019 which, \nas Michael Billig (1997) has argued, do so much ideological work. And, on a larger \nscale, it was precisely those discriminations that were affirmed by the series as a \nwhole. \n \nTrue Fictions or Fake Truths? \n \nI am not, however, assuming that BBUK1 did convince the majority of its audience \nthat it provided access to an aspect of our social \u2018reality\u2019. What people believe is \nparticularly difficult to research, and there may be a significant gap between the \nassumptions on the basis of which they generally act (without which, much discussion \nof the programme is difficult to explain) and the explicit beliefs which, if asked, they \nwould ascribe to themselves. Janet Jones\u2019 early research into the fans of the BBUK1 \nWebsite (Jones, 2001) suggests that a clear majority valued the truthfulness and \nhonesty of the games\u2019 contestants, which implies that the programme was read at least \npartly as a revelation of underlying character, not simply as a game to be won. This \ninsight is confirmed, and made more complex, in Annette Hill\u2019s more wide-ranging \nresearch on audiences for reality television (see her article in this edition). \n 12\n \nMore important may be precisely the ambiguity of the programme and the event. \nBBUK1, like all successful collective games, traded on an ambiguity: yes, it was only \na game, but wider \u2018truths\u2019 were revealed through the way it was played. Take for \nexample the treatment of the programme\u2019s anti-hero, universally known as \u2018Nasty \nNick\u2019. His \u2018offence\u2019 was not to play the game badly, but to play it too effectively in \nthe short term, by influencing other contestants\u2019 choice of evictees; he was also the \ncontestant who tried hardest to control how he was represented to the general media \naudience. The depiction of his machinations by the tabloid press was one factor in \ngenerating dramatic \u2018depth\u2019 to the programme\u2019s early weeks. Considerable moral \ncensure was heaped upon him, which was matched in his treatment in the house itself: \nreflecting this, he acknowledged \u2018I\u2019ve made a mistake, I have to live by that mistake\u2019 \njust before he was evicted. Yet, a few days after the eviction, one of the same tabloids \nthat had vilified him, affirmed his celebrity, staging a meeting between him and Brad \nPitt, who professed interest in meeting him (The Sun, 24 August 2000, 1 and 4).  \n \nThe strangest ambiguity perhaps was over what the experience of being incarcerated \nin the Big Brother house meant. Craig, the show\u2019s eventual winner, suggested in the \nDiary Room (reported in Ritchie, 2000: 108) that it meant confronting one\u2019s own life: \n\u2018the hardest thing for me in the house, maybe [sic] a lack of freedom to watch a bit of \ntelly and walk my dogs. TV stops you thinking about your own life, it\u2019s a distraction \nand it stops me going down\u2019.  The meaning of others watching the programme, then, \nwas ambiguous: both distraction (mere secondary reality) and learning experience \n(watching others discover themselves). The media were both fictional space and \nwindow onto reality. There is no need for the media to resolve such ambiguities, since \n 13\nit is precisely on such ambiguities that the media\u2019s symbolic authority relies (Couldry, \n2000a: 50-51, Meyrowitz, 1992).  \n \nConclusion \n \nIt is striking that so much effort should now be expended on television\u2019s \nrepresentation of the ordinary, the close-to-hand, rather than the spectacular; we have \nreached, it seems, the opposite of the society of the spectacle. But the contradiction is \nonly apparent. Even leaving aside the other factors involved (economic pressures, \nmore broadcast time to fill), the self-effacing presentation of everyday \u2018reality\u2019 \narguably constitutes the purest form of legitimation of the media frame (Couldry, \n2000a: 16-17). That this legitimation generally works is quite consistent with \nscepticism about the truthfulness of particular programmes, and equally important: for \nit is the general practice of making and watching \u2018reality television\u2019, and its \npersistence in spite of occasional scandals,8 that we need to explain.  \n \nA crucial part of this practice, at least from the evidence of BBUK1, is the constant \nplay on the ambiguity of its claim to present \u2018reality\u2019. At different times, the \nprogramme and the discourse associated with it portrayed it as mere distraction (as \nfiction) and as social learning (as \u2018reality\u2019). It is just such as ambiguity, and the \nunresolved switching between two incompatible positions that it involves (what \nRoland Barthes (1973) called the \u2018turnstile effect\u2019) that characterises myth more \ngenerally. \n \n 14\nThis is one reason for the abiding interest of reality television, which needs to be \npursued through international comparisons of the cultures which surround them. Big \nBrother, at least in its UK versions, adds a further twist by suggesting that sociality \ncan be affirmed through watching a game in which individuals competed on the basis \nof their desire to be liked by each other and by media onlookers. Suppose this format \nendures: it is unclear whether this would tell us more about today\u2019s \u2018saturated \nindividualism\u2019 (Maffesoli, 1996: 64) or the need to shore up a perceived crisis in the \nmedia\u2019s authority as our \u2018exemplary center\u2019 (Geertz, 1980: 13). Perhaps both. \nWhatever our wider speculations, it matters what theoretical framework we choose to \nguide us in this tangled territory; I hope to have shown one possible way forward.   \n \n 15\nAcknowledgements \nThanks to Janet Jones for discussing with me her as yet unpublished research, to the \neditors Annette Hill and Gareth Palmer for their helpful comments on an earlier draft \nof this article, and to colleagues for their comments on related material at a paper \ngiven at LSE in February 2001. \n \nReferences \n \nBarthes, Roland. 1973.
