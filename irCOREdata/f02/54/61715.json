Introduction\nIn order to understand and quantify energetic electron flux variations in the inner30\nmagnetosphere, it is necessary to assess both the electron energization and loss processes.31\nLoss mechanisms may be adiabatic, which are temporary, or non-adiabatic which result in32\nnet particle loss. Non-adiabatic loss processes include precipitation loss to the atmosphere33\ndue to pitch-angle scattering by plasma waves, and loss due to particle drift across the34\nmagnetospheric boundary. Radiation belt electrons can undergo gyroresonant pitch-angle35\nscattering by various wave-modes, including whistler-mode VLF chorus, plasmaspheric36\nELF hiss, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves, e.g., see Summers et al.37\n[2007a, 2007b] and references therein. In the present paper we analyze a particular form38\nof electron precipitation loss, namely that due to pitch-angle scattering by ELF hiss in39\nplasmaspheric \u2018plumes\u2019.40\nThe plasmasphere is a cold (a few eV), dense (10\u2212104 cm\u22123) plasma torus surrounding41\nthe Earth in the innermost magnetosphere [e.g., Carpenter, 1963; Chappell et al., 1970;42\nCarpenter and Park, 1973; Horwitz et al., 1990; Carpenter and Lemaire, 1997; Lemaire43\nand Gringauz, 1998; Ganguli et al., 2000; Goldstein, 2006; Dent et al., 2006]. The multi-44\nion (H+, He+, O+) plasma comprising the plasmasphere derives from the ionosphere and45\nco-rotates with the Earth. The region of cold plasma rotation and the overall shape of the46\nplasmasphere is controlled by the interaction of the co-rotational electric field and the solar47\nwind influenced dawn-to-dusk cross-tail electric field. During intense geomagnetic storms48\nthe plasmaspheric boundary layer, or plasmapause, can lie inside L = 2 for several days49\n[Baker et al., 2004], while during prolonged periods of quiet geomagnetic conditions the50\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 5\nplasmasphere can extend to beyond geosynchronous orbit (L \u223c 6.6) and possess no distinct51\nouter boundary [Goldstein et al., 2003]. Following geomagnetically disturbed periods,52\nand as a result of interplay between forces driving the plasma sunward and corotational53\nforces, plasma typically drains from the body of the plasmasphere in the afternoon local54\ntime sector. The resulting large-scale plasma structures which stretch toward the outer55\nmagnetosphere are usually attached to the plasmasphere and are called plasmaspheric56\nplumes or plasmaspheric drainage plumes. Historically, they have been called tails [Taylor57\net al., 1971] or detached plasma elements (or blobs) [Chappell, 1974]. Using plasma density58\ndata inferred from the Plasma Wave Experiment on the Combined Release and Radiation59\nEffects Satellite (CRRES), Moldwin et al. [2004] found that plumes can exist at all local60\ntimes under all levels of geomagnetic activity, but that most were observed in the noon-61\nto-dusk sector following enhanced geomagnetic activity. In many of the methods hitherto62\nused it should be noted that whether or not the observed plasma structures were attached63\nto the plasmasphere could not easily be determined. Excellent global images of evolving64\nplasmaspheric plumes have been provided by the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imager of the65\nImager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite [e.g., Sandel66\net al., 2003; Goldstein et al., 2003, 2004, 2005; Spasojevic et al., 2003, 2004; Burch, 2006;67\nGoldstein, 2006]. In situ measurements from the four CLUSTER satellites confirm that68\nplumes rotate around the Earth, with their feet attached to the main plasmasphere fully69\nco-rotating, but with their tips often rotating more slowly and moving outward away from70\nthe Earth [Darrouzet et al., 2006].71\nPlasmaspheric hiss is a broadband ELF electromagnetic whistler-mode emission which72\noccurs in the frequency range from \u223c 100 Hz to several kHz. Hiss is present over a73\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 6 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\nbroad region of the plasmasphere even during geomagnetically quiet periods and intensifies74\nduring storms or substorms [Smith et al., 1974; Thorne et al., 1974; Meredith et al., 2004].75\nBroadband amplitudes of hiss range from 10 pT or below during quiet periods to \u223c 100\u2019s76\npT during disturbed times [Smith et al., 1974; Tsurutani et al., 1975; Meredith et al.,77\n2004]. Hiss is generally field-aligned near the magnetic equator and tends to propagate78\nmore obliquely at higher latitudes [Parrot and Lefeuvre, 1986; Santolik et al., 2001]. There79\nare extensive observations of plasmaspheric hiss, e.g., see Hayakawa and Sazhin [1992],80\nMeredith et al. [2004], Masson et al. [2004] and references therein. Whistler-mode hiss81\nhas also been observed in plasmaspheric plumes [Chan and Holzer, 1976; Cornilleau-82\nWehrlin et al., 1978; Hayakawa et al., 1986; Parrot and Lefeuvre, 1986]. Analyzing83\nCRRES wave and particle data, Meredith et al. [2004] found that plasmaspheric hiss peaks84\nin particular equatorial (|MLAT| < 15\u25e6) and midlatitude (15\u25e6 < |MLAT| < 30\u25e6) regions,85\nmainly on the dayside, and that generally hiss amplitudes depend on L - shell, MLT and86\nmagnetic latitude, as well as substorm activity. Plasmaspheric hiss, together with other87\nwhistler-mode emissions [Abel and Thorne, 1998], plays an important role in controlling88\nthe structure of the Earth\u2019s radiation belts. Lyons and Thorne [1973] showed that the89\nformation of the quiet-time \u2018slot\u2019 region between the inner (1.3 < L < 2.5) and outer90\n(3 < L < 7) radiation belts can be explained as an equilibrium balance between inward91\nradial diffusion and pitch-angle scattering loss of energetic electrons to the atmosphere92\ninduced by plasmaspheric hiss [Lyons et al., 1972]. Plasmaspheric hiss can also cause93\nscattering loss of MeV electrons from the outer radiation belt over a timescale of days, or94\nless, under appropriate conditions [Tsurutani et al., 1975; Albert, 1994, 2003; Summers95\net al., 2007b]. Meredith et al. [2006a] used CRRES data to measure the gradual decay96\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 7\nof energetic (214 keV - 1.09 MeV) electron fluxes in the outer zone following enhanced97\ngeomagnetic activity. Meredith et al. [2006a] and Summers et al. [2007b] found that98\nscattering by plasmaspheric hiss propagating at zero or small wave normal angles could99\naccount for the measured electron decay rates over a wide range of energies and L - shells.100\nThe generation mechanism of plasmaspheric hiss has not been fully resolved and remains101\ncontroversial. There are two leading theories for the source of plasmaspheric hiss, namely,102\nin situ natural instability in the magnetosphere [e.g., Etcheto et al., 1973; Thorne et103\nal., 1979; Huang et al., 1983], and lightning-generated whistlers [e.g., Sonwalkar and104\nInan, 1989; Draganov et al., 1992; Green et al., 2005]. The analysis by Green et al.105\n[2005] supporting lightning as the dominant source for plasmaspheric hiss was disputed106\nby Thorne et al. [2006]; see also the reply by Green et al. [2006]. Meredith et al. [2006b]107\nsubsequently analyzed the entire CRRES database of plasmaspheric hiss together with108\nthe global distribution of lightning and concluded that while higher-frequency hiss (2 -109\n5 kHz) is generated by lightning, lower-frequency hiss (100 Hz - 2 kHz) is generated by110\nnatural instability in space. Evidence that lower-frequency hiss intensifies during enhanced111\ngeomagnetic activity [e.g., Meredith et al., 2004] points to natural instability as the origin112\nof lower-frequency hiss.113\nThere is increasing interest in wave-particle interactions occurring in plasmaspheric114\nplumes with respect to their role in influencing particle dynamics in the inner magneto-115\nsphere. Pitch-angle scattering by EMIC waves in plumes can cause significant precipita-116\ntion loss of energetic protons [Burch et al., 2002; Spasojevic et al., 2004; Burch, 2006].117\nSummers et al. [2007b] found that an assumed realistic spatial distribution of EMIC waves118\nand hiss in an empirically measured plume could induce rapid scattering loss of outer zone119\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 8 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\nelectrons. The relative contributions to electron scattering by hiss and EMIC waves in120\nplumes depend on the electron energy and L - shell, as well as the wave properties; see121\nFigures 21 and 22 of Summers et al. [2007b]. In the present paper we analyze hiss-electron122\ninteraction in plasmaspheric plumes selected from the CRRES mission. Specifically, we123\ndetermine intervals during which CRRES crossed a plume and select a subset of plume124\nintervals for which well-observed hiss data are available. We then use quasi-linear theory125\nto determine hiss-induced pitch-angle scattering rates at the loss cone for electrons of126\nspecified energy at given L - values. We can thereby estimate timescales for precipitation127\nloss of energetic electrons in the inner magnetosphere due to scattering by hiss in plumes.128\nThe present study is the first to determine electron precipitation loss timescales due to129\nscattering by measured hiss in observed plumes. We present our selection of plume in-130\ntervals and associated hiss data in section 2. In section 3 we summarize the necessary131\nquasi-linear theory required for our calculations. In section 4 we present our estimates for132\nelectron loss timescales due to scattering by hiss in the chosen plumes. Finally, in section133\n5 we discuss the significance of our results.134\n2. CRRES plume and wave observations\nCRRES was launched on 25 July, 1990 and functioned until 12 October, 1991. The135\nspacecraft had a geosynchronous transfer orbit, namely an elliptical orbit with a perigee136\nof 1.05 RE and an apogee of 6.26 RE with respect to the Earth\u2019s center, with an inclination137\nof 18.15\u25e6. The outermost L - shell reached by CRRES was L \u223c 8. The orbital period was138\napproximately 9 hours 55 minutes, and the apogee of CRRES precessed from 10.00 MLT139\nto 14.00 MLT through midnight before the mission terminated. The satellite was able to140\nprovide excellent coverage of the radiation belts for nearly 15 months since it traversed141\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 9\nthe inner magnetosphere on average about 5 times per day. The wave data and plasma142\ndensities used in this study were obtained from the Plasma Wave Experiment (PWE) on143\nboard CRRES. This experiment measured electric fields from 5.6 Hz to 400 kHz, using144\na 100 m tip-to-tip long wire antenna, with a dynamic range covering a factor of at least145\n105 in amplitude [Anderson et al., 1992]. The electric field detector was thus able to146\ndetect waves from below the lower hybrid resonance frequency (fLHR) to well above the147\nupper hybrid resonance frequency (fUHR) for a large fraction of each orbit. The maximum148\nplasma density that could be measured was \u223c 2000 cm\u22123 because of the upper frequency149\nlimit of the instrument. The CRRES PWE also included a boom-mounted search coil150\nmagnetometer that covered the frequency range from 5.6 Hz to 10 kHz and operated until151\nthe March 1991 storm. While the electric field data were sampled with high-frequency152\nresolution by the PWE sweep frequency receiver at eight seconds per spectra above 6.4153\nkHz, the search coil data were sampled by a 14-channel analyzer that sampled the magnetic154\nfield eight times per second every other 32 seconds.155\nWe determine the presence of a plume by monitoring the behavior of the plasma density156\nas inferred from observations of the upper hybrid resonance frequency. If, while CRRES157\nis clearly outside the plasmasphere, the density suddenly increases, remains high for some158\ntime, and then suddenly decreases, we identify the region as a potential plume. We refer159\nto such a region as a plume for simplicity, even though CRRES observations cannot deter-160\nmine if the identified high-density region is attached to the plasmasphere. We also use the161\nabsence of electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves as a criterion for identi-162\nfying high-density plasma regions, as described by Meredith et al. [2004]. Identification of163\na plume and its boundary can be problematic observationally, and is, to a degree, subjec-164\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 10 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\ntive. Determination of a boundary of a plume is straightforward if it is sharp, and difficult165\nif it is gradual. This situation likewise applies to the determination of the boundary of166\nthe plasmapause itself. To complement the techniques applied for identifying plumes in167\nour study, we also make use of the rigorous plume selection criteria of Moldwin et al.168\n[2004]. The comprehensive study of plumes during the CRRES mission by Moldwin et al.169\n[2004] employed the database of plasmapause locations identified by Moldwin et al. [2002]170\nand the empirical plasmaspheric and trough density models developed by Sheeley et al.171\n[2001]. These three studies used a common database of plasma density derived from the172\nCRRES Plasma Wave Experiment. Moldwin et al. [2002] identified the innermost steep173\ndensity gradient in the density profile as the plasmapause, a factor of 5 drop within half174\nan L - shell being required. In order to select \u2018plasmaspheric\u2019 intervals located outside the175\nplasmapause, Moldwin et al. [2004] used L = 3 as a dividing line for whether to use the176\nplasmaspheric or trough density model. If the plasmapause is located earthward of L = 3,177\nplasmaspheric plume intervals are defined as those whose density exceeds the trough plus178\none standard deviation density of the Sheeley et al. [2001] model. If the plasmapause is179\nlocated outside of L = 3, plasmaspheric plume intervals are defined as those whose density180\nexceeds the Sheeley et al. [2001] plasmaspheric model. These models are scaled to each181\norbit to account for the wide variability in the plasmaspheric density from day to day. The182\ncriterion used by Moldwin et al. [2004] to select a plume is that the density throughout183\nthe requisite interval must exceed the model value of the plasmaspheric density (or trough184\nplus one standard deviation) over a minimum of 8 consecutive observations (a duration185\nof \u223c 1 min).186\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 11\nIn our study we choose 14 plume intervals which we specify in Table 1, according to187\norbit number, by giving the start and end values of universal time (UT), magnetic local188\ntime (MLT), L - shell, and magnetic latitude (MLAT). We have chosen 10 plumes with a189\nduskside MLT location, namely crossed by outbound CRRES orbits 605, 672, 673, 674,190\n810, 869, 871, 939, 941, and 977. The remaining 4 plumes, crossed by outbound orbits191\n302 and 446, and inbound orbits 297 and 446, are non-duskside. The 14 chosen plume192\ncrossings are illustrated in Figure 1 in which we also show the approximate trajectory for193\nCRRES orbit 446. Our chosen plumes were likewise identified as plumes by Moldwin et194\nal. [2004], with the exception of the 3 plumes associated with orbits 297 and 446. These195\nlatter plumes were not selected in the Moldwin et al. [2004] study because the density196\ndid not satisfy their conservative plasmaspheric density criteria. We nevertheless regard197\nthese features as representative non-duskside \u201cplumes\u201d because of their distinctly elevated198\ndensities compared to the surrounding trough.199\nIn some of the selected plumes common to the present study and that of Moldwin et200\nal. [2004], the specified start and end of the plume interval, as for instance given by201\nL - shell, differ slightly because of the differing plume boundary criteria used in the two202\nstudies. This issue does not lead to serious difficulties in our investigation since we base203\nthe conclusions of our analysis on electron loss timescales that are calculated \u2018well inside\u2019204\neach plume. Thus, possibly spurious \u2018edge effects\u2019 are readily eliminated.205\nIn Figure 2 we show measured CRRES electron density profiles corresponding to the206\noutbound (blue) and inbound (red) portions of orbits 446, 869, 939, and 977 in the207\nrespective panels (a), (b), (c), and (d). For comparison purposes, in each panel we also208\nshow upper and lower black curves representing respectively the saturated plasmasphere209\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 12 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\ndensity and trough density given by the Carpenter and Anderson [1992] model. The210\nplume intervals for orbits 446, 869, 939, and 977 as specified by L - shell range in Table 1211\ncan be observed to match the corresponding intervals of elevated density in panels (a) -212\n(d) of Figure 2.213\nIn Figure 3 the measured wave electric field spectral intensities (in V2m\u22122Hz\u22121) are214\nplotted as a function of UT for the complete CRRES orbits 446, 869, 939, and 977 in the215\nrespective panels (a), (b), (c), and (d). The magnetic local time, magnetic latitude, and216\nL - shell are given at hourly intervals. The solid white line shows the value of the electron217\ngyrofrequency fce, determined from the measured ambient magnetic field, and the dashed218\nwhite lines below fce represent 0.5fce, 0.1fce, and the lower hybrid resonance frequency,219\nfLHR. The dotted white lines above fce correspond to the first four harmonics of fce. The220\nsolid red line denotes the upper hybrid resonance frequency fUHR = (f\n2\npe + f\n2\nce)\n1\/2 (where221\nfpe is the electron plasma frequency) calculated from the lower-frequency cut-off of the222\nelectromagnetic continuum, and the red dashed line represents fUHR calculated from wave223\nemissions at fUHR inside the plasmapause. The chosen plumes in the orbits 446, 869, 939,224\nand 977 are indicated in Figure 3, together with their associated hiss emissions. Profiles225\nof the AE index are provided at one-minute time resolution. The empirical position of226\nthe plasmapause as defined by Carpenter and Anderson [1992] is also marked.227\nWe base the calculations in our study on hiss in the frequency range 104 < f < 1040228\nHz. The general criterion used in this paper to identify hiss in plumes is that used by229\nMeredith et al. [2004] to identify plasmaspheric hiss, namely, ECH wave amplitudes for230\nfrequencies in the range fce < f < 2fce must be less than 0.0005 mVm\n\u22121 in order for231\nwave emissions below fce in the frequency band 104 < f < 1040 Hz to be identified232\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 13\nas hiss. Whistler-mode chorus has a frequency range 0.3 < f < 30 kHz in the region233\n3 < L < 7. Consequently, chorus can lie in our chosen hiss frequency band at higher234\nL - shells. However, whistler-mode chorus is usually observed outside the plasmasphere235\nand high-density regions so can be excluded from consideration in our chosen plumes.236\nAt lower L - shells, magnetosonic waves can also fall into our chosen hiss frequency band.237\nThese waves, which are closely confined to the equatorial region, are enhanced during238\nactive conditions below the lower hybrid resonance frequency fLHR, represented by the239\nlowest dashed line in the spectrograms in Figure 3. We find no evidence of enhanced240\nmagnetosonic waves within our chosen plumes, except possibly during orbit 871. For the241\nchosen plume in this orbit, hiss intensities may be slightly over-estimated in the region242\n4.25 < L < 5.25 as a result of contamination by magnetosonic waves.243\nIn order to convert observed hiss electric field spectral intensities to magnetic field244\nintensities, we use a cold-plasma dispersion relation for parallel-propagating whistler-245\nmode waves (equation (4) of section 3, with \u03b5 = 0), Maxwell\u2019s induction equation, and246\nexpression (1) given by Meredith et al. [2004]. Magnetic field wave intensities over the247\nfrequency range 104 < f < 1040 Hz are then defined as an integral of the averaged wave248\nspectral intensity (nT2Hz\u22121). The corresponding wave amplitudes are obtained by taking249\nthe square root of the wave intensities, as detailed in section 3. Conversion from electric250\nto magnetic fields is relatively insensitive to wave normal angle for wave normal angles251\nless than 500, if f < 0.5fce [Meredith et al., 2004]. We discuss our assumption of parallel252\nwave propagation further below.253\nIn Figure 4 we present hiss spectral intensities in nT2Hz\u22121 within four chosen plumes254\nduring orbits 446, 869, 939, and 977, in the respective panels (a), (b), (c), and (d). In255\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 14 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\neach panel the spectral intensity is shown at a range of specified L - shells within the256\nplume. In Figure 5 we show the measured values of the local hiss amplitudes at the given257\nL - shells within each of our 14 chosen plume intervals. Local wave amplitudes range from258\nmaximum values that exceed 300 pT, for the plumes in orbits 810 and 939, to minimum259\nvalues of less than 1 pT, in orbits 297, 446(In), and 810. This probably represents the260\nwidest range of hiss amplitudes to be expected in plasmaspheric plumes. Further, since261\nwe have mainly chosen more-commonly occurring duskside plumes while also including a262\nselection of non-duskside plumes, we can consider that the choice of plume intervals for263\nour study is reasonably general. For each of the 14 chosen plumes, we present in Table 2264\nan average value for the hiss amplitude \u2206B (pT) calculated by averaging the measured265\nspectral intensity along each plume crossing.266\n3.

Using the formalism given by Summers et al. [2007a], we write the bounce-300\naveraged diffusion coefficient \u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 as301\n302\n\u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 = 1\nS(\u03b1eq)\n\u222b \u03bbm\n0\nD\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03b1)\ncos\u03b1 cos7 \u03bb\ncos2 \u03b1eq\nd\u03bb , (9)303\nwhere304\nS (\u03b1eq) = 1.3 \u2212 0.56 sin\u03b1eq. (10)305\nIn (9), \u03b1eq is the equatorial pitch-angle of a particle, and \u03bb is the magnetic latitude of306\na particle with pitch-angle \u03b1 at any point along a field line; \u03b1eq, \u03bb, and \u03b1 satisfy the307\nrelation,308\nsin2 \u03b1 = f(\u03bb) sin2 \u03b1eq , (11)309\nwhere310\nf(\u03bb) = (1 + 3 sin2 \u03bb)1\/2\/ cos6 \u03bb . (12)311\n\u03bbm is the latitude of the mirror point of the particle and is given by the equation,312\nX6 + (3 sin4 \u03b1eq)X \u2212 4 sin4 \u03b1eq = 0 , (13)313\nwith X = cos2 \u03bbm.314\nWe substitute the local diffusion coefficient D\u03b1\u03b1(\u03b1) given by (7) into (9), and regard \u03b1 as315\na function of \u03b1eq and \u03bb, as given by (11). Thus, the bounce-averaged diffusion coefficient316\n\u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 is a function of \u03b1eq. The background magnetic field B0 occurring in D\u03b1\u03b1(\u03b1) in (9)317\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 17\nis replaced by the value,318\nB0 = Beq f(\u03bb) , (14)319\nwhere320\nBeq = Blocal\/f(\u03bblocal) . (15)321\nBeq is the equatorial magnetic field, and Blocal is the locally observed magnetic field at the322\nobserved magnetic latitude \u03bblocal, corresponding to the observed L-value. In the absence323\nof other data to show latitudinal variations in density, we assume that the background324\nelectron number density N0 is constant along a field line (N0 = Neq = Nlocal). We likewise325\nassume that the hiss spectral intensity is constant along a field line. From a statistical326\nsurvey of CRRES data Meredith et al. [2004] found that hiss peaks near the equatorial327\n(|MLAT| < 15\u25e6) and midlatitude (15\u25e6 < |MLAT| < 30\u25e6) regions. CRRES data are not328\navailable at high latitudes (|MLAT| > 30\u25e6). Our assumption that hiss is also present at329\nhigh latitudes is partially justified by other studies. For example, Thorne et al. [1973],330\nusing OGO5 search coil magnetometer data, found that hiss was present on almost every331\npass through the plasmasphere. Thorne et al. [1973] found little distinction between332\nlower latitude (|MLAT| < 30\u25e6) and high latitude (|MLAT| > 30\u25e6) plasmaspheric hiss333\nemissions, and concluded that properties of hiss remain largely constant throughout the334\nplasmasphere. We make the assumption that hiss has constant spectral intensity along a335\nfield line on the basis of the best information available. Nevertheless, we recognize that if336\nthe wave power is confined to a lower range of latitudes then our calculations may over-337\nestimate the higher-energy loss rates since the waves resonate with higher-energy electrons338\nat higher latitudes. Dependence of electron loss timescales on the latitudinal distribution339\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 18 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\nof hiss, for a given energy and L - value, is examined by Summers et al. [2007b] (section340\n3).341\nEvaluation of the integral in (9) can be carried out by standard numerical quadrature342\nwhich requires evaluation of the integrand at a set of \u03bb-values (quadrature points) in343\nthe range 0 < \u03bb < \u03bbm. This requires, in particular, determination of the local diffusion344\ncoefficient D\u03b1\u03b1(\u03b1) at the quadrature points. Therefore, at each quadrature point the345\nrelevant resonant roots x of the above-noted quartic equation must be found.346\nWe take as an estimate of the electron loss timescale,347\n\u03c4loss = (1\/\u03b4)(1\/\u3008DLC\u03b1\u03b1 \u3009) , (16)348\nwhere \u3008DLC\u03b1\u03b1 \u3009 is the bounce-averaged diffusion coefficient (9) evaluated at \u03b1eq = (\u03b1LC)eq349\nwhere (\u03b1LC)eq is the equatorial loss cone angle given by350\nsin(\u03b1LC)eq = [L\n5(4L\u2212 3)]\u22121\/4 . (17)351\nIn order to account for the limited angular (MLT) spread of the observed hiss in a given352\nplume, we have inserted into (16) a drift-averaging factor \u03b4 which we specify in the follow-353\ning section. The value of \u03c4loss depends on the kinetic energy E, L-shell, the measured hiss354\nspectral intensity I\u02c6, the drift-averaging factor \u03b4, and the equatorial value of the parameter355\n\u03b1\u2217, namely \u03b1\u2217eq = (\u2126\n2\ne\/\u03c9\n2\npe)eq. The local electron gyrofrequency |\u2126e| was determined from356\nthe CRRES fluxgate magnetometer instrument [Singer et al., 1992]. The local electron357\nplasma frequency \u03c9pe was estimated from CRRES data on electrostatic waves at the upper358\nhybrid frequency and the low-frequency cut-off of electromagnetic continuum radiation, as359\ndescribed by Meredith et al. [2002]. In the upper panel of Figure 6 we show the variation360\nof \u03b1\u2217eq with L-value, for the chosen plume intervals, deduced from local CRRES values361\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 19\nfor |\u2126e| and \u03c9pe. In the lower panel of Figure 6 we show minimum electron energies for362\ncyclotron resonance with hiss at the frequency 1040 Hz, as a function of L-value, corre-363\nsponding to the upper panel. The minimum resonant energy for electron resonance with364\nhiss is obtained by setting \u03c3 = e (for electrons) and s = 1 (for R-mode waves) in formula365\n(16) of Summers et al. [2007a].366\nAs described in this section, the determination of the electron loss timescale \u03c4loss in367\nour study assumes that the observed whistler-mode hiss is strictly field-aligned. CRRES368\ndata do not provide information on the wave-normal angle or angular spread of the waves.369\nWhile the assumption that the waves are field-aligned is likely to be an approximation,370\nwe consider that our method for calculating \u03c4loss yields reasonably reliable results based371\non the relatively limited available data. In support of our method, we cite the recent372\nanalysis by Summers et al. [2007b] who calculated electron loss timescales due to scat-373\ntering by plasmaspheric hiss during low geomagnetic activity in the region 3 < L < 5.374\nSummers et al. [2007b] assumed field-aligned hiss with zero wave-normal distribution and375\npredicted electron loss timescales in good agreement with the measured values obtained376\nfrom CRRES Medium Electrons A data by Meredith et al. [2006a]. It should never-377\ntheless be pointed out that inclusion of higher-order scattering could significantly alter378\nthe scattering rates near the edge of the loss cone if the hiss becomes strongly oblique.379\nSpecifically, we would expect increased loss timescales if the wave-normal angle is large,380\nas demonstrated by Meredith et al. [2006a].381\n4. Electron loss timescales\nElectron loss timescales calculated in this paper must of course be considered in the382\ncontext of plume lifetimes overall. Plumes have been observed over the duration of many383\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 20 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\nconsecutive CRRES orbits, e.g., see Figure 8 of Moldwin et al. [2004]. Since the CRRES384\norbital period is about 10 hours, this indicates that plumes can last from 10 hours to more385\nthan 1 day. Global imaging by the EUV imager of the IMAGE satellite has tracked the386\nevolution of various plumes over several hours to more than 1 day [e.g., Spasojevic et al.,387\n2003; Goldstein et al., 2004]. Very few studies have measured the full global evolution of a388\nplasmaspheric plume from its creation to its complete dissipation. It is possible that some389\nplumes persist for several days. For practical purposes, we take an upper limit for the390\nlifetime of a plume to be 5 days, in which case a value of \u03c4loss exceeding 5 days indicates391\nthat electron scattering by hiss is ineffective for that particular plume at the L - shell and392\nelectron energy under consideration. Plume formations exceeding 5 days in duration are393\nlikely to consist of multiple plumes formed in succession. However, at geosynchronous394\norbit (L \u223c 6.6) cold dense regions in narrow MLT channels are commonly observed over395\n10-day intervals or longer. In an investigation using multiple geosynchronous satellites,396\nMoldwin et al. [1994] found that plasmaspheric plasma was absent on only 13% of the397\ndays in the study interval.398\nFor electrons of a given energy E, we determine the loss timescale \u03c4loss due to scattering399\nby hiss at a given L - shell in a chosen plume as the inverse of the bounce-averaged diffusion400\ncoefficient \u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 evaluated at the equatorial loss cone angle (formulae (16) - (17)). An401\norbiting energetic electron traverses a plume only for a fraction of its orbit. To take402\naccount of the azimuthal (MLT) spread of a plume we have included a drift-averaging403\nfactor \u03b4 in (16). The azimuthal spread of a particular plume varies during its evolution404\nand is typically 0.1 RE to 1.5 RE or more [e.g., Spasojevic et al., 2003; Darrouzet et405\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 21\nal., 2006]. Hereinafter, we take the drift-averaging factor \u03b4 as 6% since this appears to406\ncorrespond approximately to the \u2018typical\u2019 observed azimuthal width of a plume.407\nShprits et al. [2006a] recently analyzed the controlling effect of the pitch-angle scattering408\nrates near the loss cone on energetic electron lifetimes, and found that the electron phase409\nspace density reaches an equilibrium shape within hours of the simulation when scattering410\nrates do not drop below 1\/10 of the value near the edge of the loss cone for up to a 30\u25e6-wide411\nrange of pitch angles. In this case, electron lifetimes were found to be primarily controlled412\nby scattering rates near the edge of the loss cone. Further, Shprits et al. [2006a] found413\nthat while a drop in the diffusion coefficients by a factor of 100 to 1000 near \u03b1eq = 90\n\u25e6\n414\nresults in weak scattering at high pitch angles, the lower pitch-angle particle distribution415\ndecays on a timescale comparable to that determined by the diffusion rate near the edge416\nof the loss cone. Herein, we utilize the findings of Shprits et al. [2006a] and estimate417\nelectron loss timescales by using the scattering rate at the edge of the loss cone only in418\nthose cases in which the diffusion rate is small over a high pitch-angle range narrower than419\n75\u25e6 < \u03b1eq < 90\u25e6. By using this criterion, we expect that our reported timescales afford420\nreasonable estimates of the decay times of at least the bulk of the electron distribution.421\nIn order to carry out accurate drift-averaging of the diffusion rates we require specifi-422\ncation of the complete MLT distribution of hiss spectral intensity. However, only point423\nmeasurements of the hiss intensity are made by CRRES at particular MLT-values and spe-424\ncific L - shells as the satellite traverses each particular plume. We assume that the average425\nwave power determined along the satellite track is a measure of the MLT wave distribution426\nat a given L - value. Specifically, for each plume we average over all the measured profiles427\nof the hiss spectral intensity, and we use this average intensity, together with the drift-428\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 22 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\naveraging factor \u03b4, to determine the MLT-averaged scattering rate at each L - shell. In429\nFigure 7 we show examples of profiles of the bounce-averaged and drift-averaged electron430\ndiffusion coefficient \u3008D\u03b1\u03b1\u3009 for the plume interval in orbit 977 for electrons of energies 100431\nkeV, 200 keV, 500 keV, and 1 MeV, at the given L - shells. In Figure 8 we plot the electron432\nloss timescale \u03c4loss at the specified energies as a function of L - shell for the chosen plumes433\nin orbits 446 (Out), 869, 939, and 977 in the respective panels (a), (b), (c), and (d). Hiss434\nintensity for orbit 446 (Out) is the strongest of the 4 non-duskside plume crossings, and435\nhiss intensities during orbits 869, 939, and 977 are among the strongest in the 10 duskside436\nplume crossings (see Figure 5 and Table 2). From Figure 8, and the corresponding figures437\nfor the other 10 plumes not shown, we deduce that at a fixed L - shell, \u03c4loss increases as the438\nelectron kinetic energy increases from 100 keV to 1 MeV. It is also evident from Figure 8439\nthat scattering by hiss in plumes can be especially effective for electrons of energy 100 -440\n200 keV. For instance, for the plume in orbit 977 (panel (d)), for which the average wave441\namplitude \u2206B = 102 pT, \u03c4loss ranges from 2.9 to 6.3 hr for 100 keV electrons, and from442\n6.6 to 13.8 hr for 200 keV electrons. For the plume in orbit 939 (panel (c)), for which the443\nwave intensity is strong (\u2206B = 203 pT), the minimum loss timescale (\u03c4loss)min is 0.7 hr444\nfor 100 keV electrons and 1.1 hr for 200 keV electrons. For orbit 869 (panel (b), \u2206B = 34445\npT), minimum timescales are (\u03c4loss)min = 15.2, 36.9 hr for 100 keV, 200 keV electrons,446\nand for orbit 446 (Out) (panel (a), \u2206B = 48 pT) we find (\u03c4loss)min = 1.6, 3.7 days for 100447\nkeV, 200 keV electrons.448\nWe can also see from Figure 8 that, in general, scattering by hiss in plumes is somewhat449\nless effective for 500 keV electrons, and still more ineffective for 1 MeV electrons. Minimum450\nloss timescales for the plumes in orbits 977, 869, and 446 are respectively (\u03c4loss)min = 1,451\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 23\n5.6, and 13 days, for 500 keV electrons. Corresponding respective values for 1 MeV452\nelectrons are (\u03c4loss)min = 3.1, 18, and 41 days. Particularly rapid scattering of 500 keV -453\n1 MeV electrons by hiss in plumes is possible, but only in the case of intense waves, e.g.,454\nfor the plume in orbit 939, (\u03c4loss)min = 4.6 hr for 500 keV electrons and (\u03c4loss)min = 15.4455\nhr for 1 MeV electrons.456\nIn Figure 9 we plot the loss timescales for electrons of energy 100 keV, 200 keV, 500457\nkeV, and 1 MeV, as a function of L - shell, in the respective panels (a) - (d), for all the 14458\nchosen plumes in our study. Complementary to Figure 9, we list in Table 3 the number459\nof the chosen plumes for which electrons at each of the energies 100 keV, 200 keV, 500460\nkeV, and 1 MeV, have a loss timescale less than the specified values (0.1, 0.5, 1, and461\n2 days) at some L - shells. Figure 9 and Table 3 essentially summarize the results of462\nour calculations of \u03c4loss for our total selection of plumes. The decrease in efficiency of463\nscattering by hiss as electron energies increase from 100 keV to 1 MeV is confirmed in464\nFigure 9 by the general upward shift of the timescale profiles from panel (a) through to465\npanel (d). Likewise, the number of profiles (or portions of profiles) located above \u03c4loss = 5466\ndays, the nominal timescale above which scattering is ineffective in plumes, progressively467\nincreases from panel (a) through to panel (d). The degree of effectiveness of electron468\nscattering by hiss at each of the energies 100 keV, 200 keV, 500 keV, and 1 MeV can469\nbe particularly appreciated by viewing each of the panels (a) - (d) of Figure 9 with each470\ncorresponding column of Table 3. For instance, for 100 keV electrons scattering is fairly471\nrapid (\u03c4loss < 0.5 day) at some L - shells in 6 of the 14 chosen plumes. Further, in 9472\nplumes scattering of 100 keV electrons can be regarded as at least moderately effective473\n(\u03c4loss < 2 days) at some L - shells. It is also useful to examine the entries in each particular474\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 24 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\nrow of Table 3 separately, e.g., the number of plumes for which \u03c4loss < 1 day, at some475\nL - shells, progressively decreases from 7 to 1 as the electron energy increases from 100476\nkeV to 1 MeV. The scattering of MeV electrons in less than 1 day appears to require hiss477\namplitudes well in excess of 100 pT. Such a statement is not straightforward to qualify478\naccurately, however, since \u03c4loss depends in a complicated way on the various parameters479\noccurring in the formula for the diffusion coefficient (7).480\nOf the 14 chosen plumes, 6 contain at least reasonably intense hiss, specifically with481\nan average wave amplitude satisfying \u2206B \u2265 42 pT (see Table 2). The plume in orbit482\n939, with \u2206B = 203 pT, contains the most intense hiss. We have also selected 3 plumes483\nwith relatively weak hiss, satisfying \u2206B \u2264 16 pT. Electron scattering in these plumes (in484\norbits 297, 302, and 673) is naturally likewise weak, in general, with minimum values of485\n\u03c4loss of at least several days.486\nOverall, it is clear from the numerical results reported in this section that, under ap-487\npropriate conditions, hiss in plumes can induce significant precipitation losses of energetic488\n(100 keV - 1 MeV) electrons in the outer zone, 3 < L < 7.489\n5. Discussion\nThis is the first study to quantify the contribution of pitch-angle scattering by whistler-490\nmode hiss in plumes to the total precipitation loss of outer-zone energetic electrons using491\nexperimental wave data in observed plumes. Understanding the acceleration and loss492\nmechanisms of radiation belt electrons is needed to develop models for nowcasting and493\nforecasting of relativistic (> 1 MeV) electrons that are a potential danger to satellites494\nand humans in space. A primary objective of the twin-spacecraft NASA Radiation Belt495\nStorm Probes (RBSP) mission [Kintner et al., 2002] and the proposed Canadian Outer496\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nSUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES X - 25\nRadiation Belt Injection, Transport, Acceleration and Loss Satellite (ORBITALS) mission497\n[Mann et al., 2006] is to understand the physical processes that control the dynamical498\nvariation of outer radiation belt electron fluxes. Wave-particle interactions undoubtedly499\nplay a crucial role in radiation belt electron dynamics. Electron gyroresonance with500\nVLF chorus can lead to stochastic acceleration of seed (\u223c 100 keV) electrons to MeV501\nenergies in the low density regions outside the plasmasphere and plasmaspheric plumes502\n[Summers et al., 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007b; Horne and Thorne, 1998; Roth et al., 1999;503\nSummers and Ma, 2000; Meredith et al., 2002, 2003a; Miyoshi et al., 2003; Horne et al.,504\n2005a, 2005b; Varotsou et al., 2005; Omura and Summers, 2006; Shprits et al., 2006b;505\nLi et al., 2007]. Relativistic (> 1 MeV) electrons just outside the plasmapause can be506\nscattered by VLF chorus into the loss cone, on timescales of a day, and observed at507\nlow altitudes as microburst precipitation [Lorentzen et al., 2001; Thorne et al., 2005].508\nScattering by EMIC waves along the duskside plasmasphere can induce precipitation loss509\nof MeV electrons on timescales of several hours to a day [Lorentzen et al., 2000; Summers510\nand Thorne, 2003; Meredith et al., 2003b; Summers et al., 2007b]. In the present study511\nwe have shown that whistler-mode hiss in plumes can likewise induce precipitation loss512\nof MeV electrons in a day or less, though only in the case of exceptionally strong waves513\n(typically with amplitude 100\u2019s pT). Of particular interest in our study is the finding that514\nelectrons of energy 100 - 200 keV, which are required to form a seed population from515\nwhich MeV electrons are generated, can suffer rapid precipitation loss (in a timescale516\nof hours) due to scattering by hiss in plumes. Thus, while scattering by hiss in plumes517\nmay not usually induce rapid precipitation loss of MeV electrons, hiss scattering may518\nreduce the generation of MeV electrons by depleting the seed electron population. To519\nD R A F T October 27, 2007, 1:33pm D R A F T\nX - 26 SUMMERS ET AL.: ELECTRON SCATTERING IN PLUMES\nverify the latter process, quantitative modeling of the transport of seed electrons from520\nthe plasmasheet would be required. The general conclusion to our study is that pitch-521\nangle scattering by hiss in plumes in the frequency range 104 < f < 1040 Hz can be522\nefficient for inducing precipitation loss of outer-zone electrons with energies throughout523\nthe range 100 keV - 1 MeV. However, the results in section 4 show that the magnitude524\nof the precipitation loss timescale can be highly dependent on wave power, L - value, and525\nelectron energy. Further, as we have pointed out above, pitch-angle scattering rates can526\nbe sensitive to wave-normal angle and the latitudinal distributions of density and wave527\npower. Accordingly, the precipitation loss timescales computed in this paper could be528\nconservatively regarded as lower bounds.529\nThe competition between acceleration and loss of energetic electrons is determined530\nby wave-particle interactions taking place outside and inside the dense thermal regions531\ncomprising the plasmasphere and plasmaspheric plumes. Acceleration and loss of energetic532\nelectrons due to gyroresonance with whistler-mode chorus take place outside these thermal533\nregions, while precipitation loss due to pitch-angle scattering by hiss and EMIC waves534\ntakes place inside the thermal regions. The generation and global distribution of energetic535\nelectrons in the outer zone is therefore greatly influenced by the distribution of thermal536\nplasma. Accurate modeling of the dynamical variation of the outer radiation belt electron537\nflux requires knowledge of the spectral intensity and temporal variation of the appropriate538\nwave modes both inside and outside the thermal plasma regions.539\nAcknowledgments.
