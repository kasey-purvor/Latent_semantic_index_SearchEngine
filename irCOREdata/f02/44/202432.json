Most of this increase has resulted from decreasing mortality at older ages. Patterns of oldest old mortality (ages 80+) differed significantly between men and women as well as between East and West Germany.

Introduction\nMortality patterns in Germany are an intriguing subject for social scientists. The recent\nGerman history offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of political, economic and social\nfactors on mortality changes.  Prior to 1945 East and West Germans shared a cultural and\nhistorical background that included the political system. Between 1949 and 1989, however, East\nand West Germans lived under different political and economic systems, a socialist planned\neconomy (East Germany) versus a free-market democracy (West Germany).  With German\nreunification in 1990 the two German populations were again integrated into one political and\neconomic system.\nThe purpose of this study is to examine recent trends in old age mortality in Germany.  We\nconsider the period from 1970 to 1996, and we present mortality indicators separately for the\nformer German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and the former Federal Republic of\nGermany (West Germany).  The paper addresses two issues.  First, we examine whether and to\nwhat degree increases in life expectancy were determined by increased survival at older ages.\nSecondly, we provide a detailed description of recent trends in mortality among the oldest old\n(ages 80+).  In this context it is of interest to determine whether the changes associated with\nGerman reunification in 1990 altered any of the long-term trajectories of oldest old mortality.\nPrevious research indicated that life expectancy was somewhat different in East and West\nGermany.  Immediately after the war, mortality was higher in East Germany than in West\nGermany [Scholz 1996].  However, this pattern changed quickly.  By the early 1950s, mortality\nin East Germany had reached the pre-war level and, subsequently, even fell somewhat below\nWest German figures. With regard to the male population, a slight East German lead lasted until\nthe mid 1970s.  Mortality for women was about the same in both German states from the early\n1950s until the early 1970s.\nAs of about 1970 mortality trends in East and West Germany diverged (see Figure 1).  Life\nexpectancy at birth in East Germany increased with a low gradient for both sexes, while life\nexpectancy in West Germany rose more rapidly.  With the collapse of the socialist regime in\n1989 and German reunification one year later, life expectancy in East Germany began to increase\nat an accelerated pace.  The increase in life expectancy was more pronounced for females than\nfor males. However, this general trend towards increased life expectancy was accompanied by a\ntemporary set-back for men.  Detailed analyses indicated that male life expectancy actually\ndeclined in East Germany immediately before and after reunification.  For males, the 1989 level\nwas not reached again until 1992.  This short peak in mortality was due to higher death rates in\nmen aged 15 to 65 [H\u00e4ussler, Hempel, and Reschke 1995, Dorbritz and G\u00e4rtner 1995].  Older\nage groups did not experience a similar increase in death rates.  Mortality for these older age\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\ngroups continued to decrease gradually [H\u00e4ussler, Hempel, and Reschke 1995, Schott,\nBergmann, and Wiesner 1995].\nDemographers have documented the remarkable increases in survival at older ages in\ndeveloped countries.  During the 20th century death rates at older ages have fallen dramatically in\nmany European countries [Kannisto et al. 1994, Vaupel 1997].  Mortality decreases have been\nmore pronounced for females than males, and the pace of decline has been more rapid in recent\ndecades than it was in earlier decades.  One goal of the present study was to explore whether\nsimilar trends can also be observed for the two German states.\nIn sum, the present study focuses on trends in old age mortality in Germany.  In a first step\nwe examine the contribution of different age groups to changes in life expectancy, separately for\nthe two German states and for different time periods (prior to, during, and after reunification).\nOur goal was to evaluate whether and to what degree increases in life expectancy were\ndetermined by increased survival at older ages.  In a second step we investigate changes in oldest\nold mortality (ages 80+) for the period between 1955 and 1996, again separately for the two\nGerman states.  Utilizing Lexis maps [Andreev 1999, Vaupel et al. 1998] we present death rates\nfor each age (80 to 99) and each year (1955 to 1996).  Our goal was to obtain a detailed\ndescription of trends in old age mortality in Germany in recent decades, and to assess whether\nthese trends were altered by German reunification.  In the final section we discuss potential\ndeterminants of old age mortality in Germany, with an emphasis on medical and nursing care,\nindividual economic resources, and life-style factors.\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n2. Data and methods\nThe empirical analyses in this paper are based on two different sets of data.  Data published\nby the German Statistical Office [Statistisches Bundesamt 1980\u20131998] are used to examine\nmortality patterns across all ages and to investigate the contribution of different age groups to\nchanges in life expectancy.  The second data set used in this study is the Kannisto-Thatcher\nOldest Old Database [Kannisto 1994], a database that was specifically designed to investigate\nmortality at the ages of  80 and above.\nA decomposition method [Pollard 1988, p266, equation 3] is used to analyze the\ncontribution of different age groups to changes in life expectancy at birth.  Results obtained with\nthis method are reasonably accurate as long as the increases in life expectancy are modest, as is\nthe case with East and West Germany.  The decomposition method is applied for the whole\nperiod under consideration, 1980\u20131996, as well as broken down into three parts: 1980\u20131987\n(prior to reunification), 1987\u20131992 (the period of reunification), and 1992\u20131996 (the period after\nreunification). The results obtained from the analyses of contribution of different ages to changes\nof life expectancy at birth are shown in Figures 2a (females, East Germany), 2b (females, West\nGermany), 3a (males, East Germany), and 3b (males, West Germany).\nThe decomposition of change in life expectancy at birth is based on absolute changes in\nage-specific death rates, and absolute changes tend to be greater at older ages, where death rates\nare high.  In addition to the decomposition analysis, we present average annual rates of mortality\ndecline [e.g. Wilmoth and Horiuchi 1999, p486] by age and sex in order to investigate relative\nmortality decline.  The rates of relative change in mortality are shown in Figures 4a (females,\nEast Germany), 4b (females, West Germany), 5a (males, East Germany), and 5b (males, West\nGermany).\nWhen it comes to mortality at the oldest ages, the Kannisto-Thatcher Oldest Old Database\nis presumably a better source of information than mortality estimates published by the German\nStatistical Office, because it relies on the method of extinct generations. This method [Vincent\n1951] builds up the history of a cohort (its size by age and sex) by summing up data on deaths\nbeginning with the oldest individual for a cohort which has died out. The cohort history was\nchosen because central death rates are most accurately calculated when a closed group of persons\nis followed up from one exact age to the next.  It is known that accuracy becomes increasingly\nimportant when the numbers are small, as is the case at the oldest ages.\nSpecifically, the Kannisto-Thatcher Oldest Old Database includes data on deaths by sex\nand by single year of age combined with the year of birth.  The data begin at age 80 and start with\nthe year 1950 for most of the 31 countries that are presently included in the database.  There is no\nupper limit for age for most of the countries.  For some countries, however, the age limit is 99\nyears. Kannisto [Kannisto 1994] studied the quality and reliability of German mortality data and\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\nconcluded that the data on deaths were accurate for both East and West Germany.  Information\non cause of death is not included in the database.  Cause-of-death data (particularly for old\ndecedents) have many problems. Comparative analyses involving cause-of-death data for the\nperiod prior to German unification are even more problematic because the two German states\nused rather different coding procedures [Br\u00fcckner 1993, Dinkel 1999].\nIn the present study we developed Lexis maps based on these data for ages 80 and over and\nfor the period 1950\u20131996 (see Figures 6 and 7). Lexis maps can be used to graphically display\nmortality changes over time and separately for different ages.  The maps presented here are based\non mortality indicators whose layers differ by color.  The colors indicate different death rates in\nFigure 6 and different death rate ratios in Figure 7.\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n3. Results\n3.1. Changes in mortality across all ages\nDuring the period 1980\u20131996 life expectancy increased by 5.3 years for females and 3.1\nyears for males in East Germany, compared to 3.4 years for West German females and 3.9 years\nfor males. Thus, the increase in life expectancy was most pronounced among East German\nfemales.  When the period 1980 to 1996 is broken down into the three periods 1980\u20131987, 1987\u2013\n1992, and 1992\u20131996, then it becomes obvious that the mortality changes were not synchronized\nfor both sexes in the two former states. Most of the mortality decline for East German females\noccurred during the period 1992\u20131996 (see Figures 2a and 4a), while for West German females\nthe period 1980\u20131987 was more important (see Figures 2b and 4b). The same is true for changes\nin male mortality. The period 1992\u20131996 was most important for the mortality decline among\nEast German males (see Figures 3a and 5a), while the period 1980\u20131987 was most important for\nthe mortality decline among their West German counterparts (see Figures 3b and 5b).\nThere are several interesting patterns with respect to mortality in early and middle\nadulthood.  For both sexes and in both German states, the period around unification (1987\u20131992)\nwas least efficient in reducing mortality in these adult ages. For example, for East German\nfemales aged 30\u201349 years, mortality actually increased during this period (see Figures 2a and 4a).\nThis upward trend in mortality in the period around unification was even more emphasized\namong East German males, where mortality increased for all ages from 15 to 64 (see Figures 3a\nand 5a). Another distinctive pattern is that the period prior to unification (1980\u20131987) was most\nefficient in reducing West German female (Figures 2b and 4b) and male (Figures 3b and 5b)\nadult mortality when compared to the other two periods.  This is in contrast to the pattern\nobserved in East Germany, where the period after unification (1992\u20131996) was most efficient in\nreducing adult mortality for both females (Figures 2a and 4a) and males (Figures 3a and 5a).\nAn interesting picture emerged for a cohort of East and West German men who were born\nin the late-1920s and who were aged about 65-69 years in 1992-1996.  Their mortality decline\nwas less pronounced when compared to the adjacent cohorts (see Figures 3 and 5).  These men\nwere adolescents during the Second World War, and they may have acquired additional risks\nthrough the hardships of the war.  Note that Horiuchi [Horiuchi 1983] documented elevated\nmortality at older ages among male cohorts in Germany who were adolescents during the First\nWorld War.\nInfant and child mortality continued to decline gradually from 1980 to 1996.  This was the\ncase for both German states and for males and females (see Figures 2\u20135).  It seems that German\nreunification did not alter trends in infant and child mortality.\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n3.2. The contribution of older age groups (60 and over)\nThe older age groups contributed most to the increase in life expectancy at birth for\nfemales in East (Figure 2a) and West (Figure 2b).  This is reflected in the period 1980\u20131996 as a\nwhole, as well as when it is broken down into the periods 1980\u201387, 1987\u201392, and 1992\u201396.  Life\nexpectancy at birth for females in East Germany increased by 5.3 years.  More than 71% of this\nincrease came from ages 60 and above, and about 31% from ages 80 and above (see Figure 2a).\nLife expectancy at birth for females in West Germany increased by 3.4 years.  Ages over 60\ncontributed 61% to this increase and ages over 80 contributed 22% (see Figure 2b).  Thus, the\ncontribution from the old ages to the increase in female life expectancy was quite substantial,\nparticularly in East Germany.\nThe period after reunification (1992\u20131996) was characterized by a substantial reduction in\nfemale old age mortality in East Germany (Figures 2a and 4a), while the period 1980\u20131987 was\nthe most important for the reduction among females in West Germany (Figures 2b and 4b).  This\nis similar to the patterns observed in early and middle adulthood.  In contrast to the patterns\nobserved among younger women, reunification did not coincide with an increase in old age\nmortality. Quite the reverse was true: old age mortality decreased. Note that Figures 2a and 4a\nalso suggest that female mortality in East Germany, in particular at old ages, started declining\nprior to reunification. However, it was during 1987\u20131992 and 1992\u20131996 that the pace of the\nmortality decline accelerated.\nThe pattern for males (Figures 3a and 3b) was somewhat different from that of females.\nThe contribution of old and oldest ages was less prominent for males than for females in both\nEast and West Germany.  During 1980\u20131996 male life expectancy at birth increased by 3.1 years\nin East Germany.  62% of this increase came from ages 60 and over, and 17% from ages 80 and\nover.  In West Germany male life expectancy increased by 3.9 years from 1980 to 1996.  Ages\nover 60 contributed 60% and ages over 80 contributed 9%.  Although the pace of mortality\ndecline at the oldest old ages was slower for males than for females, it is obvious that there was\nalso a considerable decline in old age mortality among men in both East and West Germany.\nTo summarize, Figures 2a, 2b, 3a, and 3b indicate that most of the increases in life\nexpectancy came as a result of decreasing mortality at older ages (ages over 60).  This pattern\nwas observed for males and for females, in East Germany as well as in West Germany. The\npattern was more pronounced for females than for males, and it was more obvious in East than in\nWest Germany.\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n3.3. Changes in oldest old mortality (80 and over)\nA fair amount of the mortality decline in both East and West Germany can be attributed to\nthe oldest old (ages 80+).  A detailed observation of mortality changes at these ages is shown in\nFigure 6, where central death rates are plotted, separately for East and West Germany as well as\nfor males and females. The period covered is 1955\u20131996.\nAn examination of these historical trends indicates that oldest old mortality decline in East\nGermany was present as of the late 1980s.  The decline accelerated in the 1990s, particularly\namong females.  A closer look at the female map for East Germany suggests that around\nreunification there was an acceleration of the mortality decline for almost all oldest old ages\n(80+). This explains the high contribution of ages over 80 to changes of life expectancy at birth\nduring 1987\u201392, as shown in Figure 2a.\nA different picture is portrayed in West Germany.  Female mortality at the oldest ages\nstarted to decrease in the early 1970s.  Here the mortality decline was gradual and it affected all\nages 80 and over.  For males the mortality decline started later, around 1980.  Similar to females,\nthe decline was gradual during the remaining period.  A distinctive feature for females in both\nEast and West Germany is that we see a mortality decline even at the very old ages over 95.\nFigure 7 shows the ratios of the central death rates in East and West Germany for both\nmales and females. The color red indicates lower death rates in East Germany; the color blue\nsignifies lower death rates in West Germany.  The scale on the right shows the ratio of East\/West\nGerman central death rates. For example, a ratio of 1.1 indicates that mortality in East Germany\nis 10% higher than in West Germany.\nThe Lexis maps for both sexes indicate that East and West Germany had similar levels of\noldest old mortality (ratios close to 1.0) until about 1970.  The female advantage of West\nGermany started in the 1970s, while the male advantage started in the 1980s.  For females the\ngap diverged further in the 1980s.  Female oldest old mortality in East Germany was sometimes\n30% higher than in West Germany.  The male map shows that the divergence in the 1980s was\nnot as pronounced as it was for females.  Male mortality among the oldest old in East Germany\nwas sometimes 20% higher than in West Germany.\nThere appears to be a time lag of about five to ten years between female and male changes,\nwith mortality changes for females preceding changes for males.  This lag was observed in West\nGermany when female mortality started declining in the 1970s while male mortality followed\nthis decline in the 1980s (see Figures 6 and 7).  Similarly, in East Germany the rapid decline of\nfemale mortality at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s is now being experienced by\nmales in the last years of 1990s (see Figure 6).\nFor both sexes the East-West German gap was wider in the late 1980s and it seems to be\nclosing in the 1990s.  Interestingly, the disappearance of the large West German advantage is\nmost salient for the very old ages (ages over 90). It is even more emphasized among\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\ncentenarians.  Table 1 lists the absolute number and the proportion of centenarians (ages 100 and\nover) in 1990 and 1996, separately for East and West Germany as well as for women and men.\nDuring this period there was a rapid increase in the number of centenarians in both parts of\nGermany.  However, the increase was more pronounced in East Germany.  During 1990\u20131996\nthe number of female centenarians in East Germany increased by a factor of 2.51 (184\ncentenarians in 1990 versus 461 centenarians in 1996).  The number of female centenarians in\nWest Germany in that same period increased only by a factor of 1.88.   Similarly, the increase in\nthe number of male centenarians was more pronounced in East Germany (factor 1.49) than it was\nin the West (factor 1.13).\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n4. Discussion\nIt is tempting to attribute the apparent closing of the oldest old mortality gap between East\nand West Germany to the historical drama of political reunification.  Putting an obvious cause to\nan obvious trend has a certain prima facie plausibility.  However, the old-age patterns we have\npresented suggest that some of the mortality decline in East Germany actually started prior to\nreunification.  We also observed considerable similarities between the two German states that\nwere only gradually affected by reunification.  For example, it appears that the increase in life\nexpectancy after 1980 was dominated by the prolongation of life at older ages in both German\nstates.  Another similarity between East and West Germany was that the decline in old age\nmortality was greater among women than men.\nThis is not to say that reunification did not have any impact, or that differences between\nEast and West Germany were negligible.  One profound difference between the two German\nstates was that decline in old age mortality prior to reunification was much more pronounced in\nWest than in East Germany.  Mortality at ages 80 and above started to decline in West Germany\nin the mid 1970s.  Not until ten years later did oldest old mortality begin to decrease in East\nGermany.  And it occurred at a slower pace.  German reunification in 1990 had little, if any effect\non the long-term trend of oldest old mortality in West Germany.  In contrast, East German death\nrates at the oldest ages decreased markedly after 1990.  It appears that this downward trend after\nreunification was not only a continuation of a trend started earlier, but that it reflects an\naccelerated pace of decline in old age mortality in East Germany.\nHow can we explain the late-life mortality patterns observed in the two German states?  A\ngrowing body of research documents that early-life and mid-life conditions are important\ndeterminants of late-life mortality.  Some researchers focused on the effects of mid-life events\nand exposure to health risk on late-life mortality [e.g. Manton, Stallard, and Corder 1997]. Others\ninvestigated the effects of malnutrition, infectious diseases and other types of biomedical and\nsocioeconomic stressors early in life on adult health and mortality [e.g. Barker 1992, Davey\nSmith et al. 1998, Elo and Preston 1992, Fogel and Costa 1997].  However, there is also\nconflicting evidence that suggests that current conditions may be much more important than\nconditions earlier in life [Christensen et al. 1995, Kannisto, Christensen, and Vaupel 1997].\nKannisto [Kannisto 1994] studied the development of oldest old mortality in several developed\ncountries, and Dinkel [Dinkel 1992] analyzed mortality trends in German cohorts.  Both\nconcluded that period factors with immediate effects were considerably more significant than\ncohort effects.  Consistent with this conclusion, results from our study provide little evidence for\nthe presence of cohort effects.  Our central findings were that old-age mortality declined earlier\nand gradually in West Germany, and that East Germany was characterized by later and more\nabrupt decline that coincided with German reunification.  These developments occurred\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\nsimultaneously in all age groups studied (see Figures 6), and there was no evidence for a time lag\nwhich could be indicative of a cohort effect.\nOf particular interest are the mortality trajectories of East German individuals who\nexperienced the transition from a socialist planned economy to a free-market democracy late in\ntheir lives.  Here we observed this rather sudden mortality decline that suggests a period effect.\nMoreover, it appears that this period factor operated without delay because the mortality decline\nbecame visible immediately after reunification.  This is somewhat surprising, because traditional\nepidemiological risk factors such as nutrition or changes in the health care system are thought to\noperate over rather long time periods [Manton, Stallard, and Corder 1997].  However, there are\nalso intervention studies suggesting that dietary changes can have immediate and profound\neffects on health [e.g. Stich et al. 1991].  It is also true that some of the changes that came with\nreunification came indeed rather quickly.  The social and economic union between the two\nGerman states was established in July 1990, and pensions were paid in Western currency and\nraised to West German levels after that date [Frerich and Frey 1990].  Similarly, laws\nimplementing the Western medical care system in East Germany were passed in the summer of\n1990, and East Germans were eligible to receive health care according to Western standards after\nthat date.  Thus, it was possible to transfer patients to Western facilities if a particular treatment\nwas not available in the East.\nFor these reasons, we restrict our discussion to migration as a selection factor and to three\nfactors with presumably causal effects: medical and nursing care expenditures, economic\nresources, and life-style factors.  The health care and pension systems were part of the\ninstitutional transfer of reunification and were altered overnight.  Life-style factors were only\nindirectly affected by the historical event of unification, and changes in behavioral and life-style\nfactors occurred probably less abrupt.\n4.1. Migration\nSome scholars [H\u00e4ussler, Hempel, and Reschke 1995, Dinkel 1999] highlight a so-called\n\u201cpositive migration effect.\u201d  They argue that between 1945 and 1961, when the Berlin Wall was\nbuilt, many young adults and their families left East Germany and moved to West Germany\nwhile the elderly and unfit stayed.  There is considerable empirical support for a healthy\nmigration hypothesis in general [Fox, Goldblatt, and Adelstein 1982].  However, to our\nknowledge there is no empirical evidence that migration of the young and healthy in fact\ncontributed to the difference in old-age mortality between East and West Germany.\nIn contrast, Schott et al. [Schott et al. 1994] focus on a so-called \u201cnegative migration\neffect.\u201d  They argue that after the war millions of refugees fled from the Soviet army and most of\nthem eventually settled down in West Germany.  The hardship they met on their way to West\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\nGermany may have weakened their physical constitution, which in the long run may have\ncontributed to higher mortality rates in West Germany.  We are not aware that this hypothesis has\nbeen tested empirically.  Both the positive and the negative migration hypothesis seem plausible,\nbut no firm conclusions can be drawn in the absence of empirical support for either hypothesis.\nIt is also possible that both hypotheses are true but that their effects cancel out.\n4.2. Medical and nursing care\nAn analysis of the differences in the welfare regimes of East and West Germany may help\nto explain the observed mortality patterns.  This is particularly true for the oldest age groups,\nwhich strongly depend on welfare transfers.  In general, the welfare regime of the former German\nDemocratic Republic can be characterized as \u201cmeans tested\u201d and \u201cservice heavy.\u201d  That is, the\nwelfare regime was targeted at fulfilling the basic needs of individuals and it operated primarily\nthrough the provision of services.  In addition, this welfare system focused on the young and\nmiddle-aged population.\nIn contrast, the West German welfare regime can be characterized as \u201cstatus preserving\u201d\nand \u201ctransfer heavy.\u201d  That is, the West German welfare system focused on preserving the status\nof individuals when they were confronted with hardships, and it operated primarily through\nmonetary payments.  It has been argued that the status preserving and transfer heavy West\nGerman system disproportionately favored the elderly [Hockerts 1998, Lampert 1996, Manow-\nBorgwardt 1994].\nTransfer payments to the elderly \u2013 i.e., pension payments and health care expenditures \u2013\nwere several times higher in West than in East Germany [Statistisches Bundesamt 1994, Verband\nDeutscher Rentenversicherungstr\u00e4ger 1999].  However, an exact comparison is difficult because\nboth countries defined their statistics differently.  Relative trends in social expenditures may give\na better picture of the extent of services rendered to the elderly population.  Between 1970 and\n1989 expenses for medical care quadrupled in West Germany.  But even in the former German\nDemocratic Republic, where the economy eventually went bankrupt [Ritschl 1995], health care\nexpenditures more than tripled during the same period.  It is noteworthy that increases in medical\nexpenditures rose steeper between 1986\u20131988 than before [Statistisches Bundesamt 1994].  As\nwomen make more use of medical services than men do, they might have benefited more from\nmedical care improvements in East Germany before reunification.\nStarting in 1970 the former German Democratic Republic tried to improve the supply of\nold age care [Ziesemer 1990, Bardehle and Vo\u00df 1990, Sch\u00f6nfeld 1990].  Although the number of\nplaces in nursing homes increased from 96,000 in 1970 to 140,000 in 1988, it was still the case\nthat more than 100,000 applicants could not be admitted to homes because of a lack of space.\nFurther, the quality of care in those institutions remained relatively low.  Regular medical check\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\nups and rehabilitation were not possible [Schmidt 1990], and there was a chronic shortage of\ntrained nurses.\nChildren who wanted to care for their frail parents were faced with several obstacles.\nWomen were the major caregivers, and in East Germany nearly all women participated in the\nlabor force.  Giving up employment in order to care for an old parent implied that these women\nhad to give up their social security benefits.  There was also no market for social services or\nmedical aid that could be relied upon, and appropriate apartments for frail elderly people were\nscarce.\nWith respect to old age mortality, it was probably crucial that the former German\nDemocratic Republic did not keep pace with the international medical progress that took place in\nthe field of chronic diseases.  The fight against chronic diseases, from which many older persons\nsuffer, is capital-intensive.  Many scholars argue that the lack of economic dynamism is one of\nthe main reasons why the health care regime of East Germany started to fall behind in the 1970s.\nThe lack of domestic innovations and the lack of foreign currency to buy new innovations from\nthe West led to a stratified, rationing health care system [Volpp 1991].  After reunification in\n1990, the shortage of adequate medical equipment and treatment became obvious [Bause and\nMatauschek 1990, Sachverst\u00e4ndigenrat f\u00fcr die Konzertierte Aktion im Gesundheitswesen 1991].\nAbout 17% of hospitals were rundown to a greater or lesser extent, 30% of the beds used in\nclinics were beyond repair, and medical technology was trailing behind Western standards by 15\nto 20 years [Mielck 1991].  It was estimated that 1.5 billion DM would be needed to update the\nmedical technology [Becker 1990].  Further, the available amount of nearly 2,000 different drugs\nwas not considered adequate, given the fact that 40,000 drugs were on the market in West\nGermany.  Experts also estimated that the need for dialysis was only met in 38% of all cases, and\nthe demand for kidney transplants and open-heart surgery was met in only 50% of all cases\n[Arnold and Schirmer 1990, Korbanka 1990, Thiele 1990].\nStudies on mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention confirm that\nmedical resource deficiencies are decisive [Velkova, Wolleswinkel-Van den Bosch, and\nMackenbach 1997].  It is well documented that a lack of appropriate medical care has immediate\neffects on mortality at older ages.  We can speculate that the financial weakness of the socialist\nhealth care system in East Germany was one of the main reasons why the decline in old age\nmortality was relatively slow prior to reunification.  After reunification the Western health care\nsystem was quickly installed in East Germany.  Consequently, the accelerated decline in old age\nmortality described above occurred.\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n4.3. Economic resources\nPension payments made up the largest share of social expenditures in both German states.\nDue to the different welfare regimes, however, both the absolute amount and the relative increase\nwere much smaller in East than in West Germany prior to 1989.  Comparing the average income\nof households, we see that in both German states pensioners have considerably less income than\npeople in the work force.  In 1985, a household with a retired head had 36% in East Germany and\n65% in West Germany of the income of a household with an employed head, respectively.\nAfter reunification the West German pension scheme was transmitted to East Germany,\nwhich made retired people one of groups that benefited most from the transformation.  In 1990\nthe monthly pension of an East German retired employee was 40% that of his or her West\nGerman counterpart.  This income gap diminished quickly in the following years. In 1999 an\nEast German pensioner received on average 87% of what a West German pensioner got [Presse-\nund Informationsamt der Bundesregierung 1999].  Particularly women from East Germany have\nbenefited because they had, on average, considerably longer working biographies than their West\nGerman counterparts.\nThe shift from a relatively deprived to a relatively privileged living situation probably\naffected the health and mortality of the oldest old. There is an extended literature on\nsocioeconomic differentials in mortality [Hummer, Rogers, and Eberstein 1998] that suggests\nthat individual resource availability increases health chances and, ultimately, survival.  It is quite\nlikely that the increased individual resources and opportunities that came with reunification have\nalso contributed to the accelerated decline in death rates in East Germany.\n4.4. Life-style factors\nThe interaction between material resources, health, and longevity is probably mediated\nthrough various behavioral choices. Demographers and epidemiologists focus on eating and\ndrinking habits, smoking behavior and exercise.  Pre-unification comparisons between East and\nWest German nutritional habits revealed a significantly lower consumption of milk, vegetable oil\nand fat, fresh vegetables and tropical fruits in East Germany, while the intake of sausages, baked\ngoods, butter and spirits was significantly higher. The calorie intake in East Germany was also\nconsiderably higher for fat and lower for carbohydrates [Winkler, Holtz, and D\u00f6ring 1992a,\n1992b, Thiel and Heinemann 1996].\nAfter 1989 consumption patterns changed.  Individuals in East Germany consumed more\ncarbohydrates, vitamins, calcium, and potassium.  Consumption of fresh fruits increased while\nthe intake of baked goods and meat decreased [Winkler, Brasche, and Heinrich 1997].  These\nconsumption patterns may help to explain both why old age mortality patterns in East and West\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\nGermany diverged before reunification and why they then converged after reunification.  One\ncannot, however, come to a conclusive interpretation here, since the nutritional studies cited\nabove all involved individuals at younger ages.\nThere is evidence to suggest that older people rarely change their eating habits [Brockmann\n1998].  Rather than improving their diet, they tend to avoid food that is difficult to chew, such as\nfresh fruit and vegetables.  On the other hand, many people above the age of 80 do not cook for\nthemselves.  Some live in institutions, others make use of food delivery services.  In this way,\nelderly people in East Germany might well have profited from a better food supply after\nreunification without actually changing their individual behavior.\n4.5. Conclusion\nDuring the past two decades there has been a substantial decline in old age mortality in\nboth German states.  The decline was more pronounced for women than for men.  The decline in\nWest Germany seems to follow a gradual, long-term trend.  The decline in East Germany was\naccelerated after reunification, and it appears that the East-West German gap in old age mortality\nis closing.  This effect of German reunification on old age mortality in East Germany attests to\nthe plasticity of human life expectancy at older ages and to the importance of late-life events.\nMany Germans are ambivalent about the balance of gains and losses that came with\nreunification [Schmitt, Maes, and Seiler 1999] and wonder what reunification will ultimately\nbring.  Old age mortality is just one of many aspects of human development that might be used to\nevaluate the effects of reunification, and this aspect seems to suggest that reunification did have a\nbeneficial effect: death rates of the oldest old in East Germany fell considerably after\nreunification.  The specific mediating factors for this effect remain unknown, but it is likely that\nimprovements in the health care system played a major role.  It is also likely that there was not\nonly one mediating factor.  Rather, we believe that reunification and the many changes that came\nwith it affected old age mortality through various pathways including individual economic\nresources and life-style factors.\nDemographic Research - Volume 3, Article 1\nhttp:\/\/www.demographic-research.org\/Volumes\/Vol3\/1\/ 12 July 2000\n5.
