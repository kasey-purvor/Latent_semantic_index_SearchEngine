They are now increasingly commonplace in the EU as it\nenlarges. Up until June 2005, Britons expected to be asked to consent or reject the proposed EU\nConstitutional Treaty in a national referendum but the French and Dutch no votes in their own\nreferendums in May and June 2005 scuppered this and Britain and other EU countries paused for a\nperiod of reflection. The \u2018non\u2019 and \u2018nee\u2019 votes constituted public defiance of their governments\u2019\nappeal to accept the EU Constitution, indicating how far removed the French and Dutch political\nelites were from the public (see Parker, 2005). But governments are often out of touch, and\nEuropean leaders are no exception (Watt, 2005). Prime Minister Blair challenged British public\nopinion with the prosecution of the Iraq War (Baines and Worcester, 2005), as did the Swedish\ngovernment when encouraging their citizens to accept the Euro (Widfeldt, 2004). In this research\nnote, we consider British public opinion on Europe and the Constitutional Treaty, providing a\nsummary of the referendum process along five key themes as follows:\n1. A sceptical view of the Constitution: all polls showed that a majority of British people\nintended to vote \u201cno\u201d rather than \u201cyes\u201d in the referendum;\n2. A persuadable electorate: more detailed analysis highlights the crucial importance of\nthose who had not made up their minds and how they might affect the outcome of the vote;\n3. A largely under-informed public: the lack of information about Europe that the British\npublic possessed characterises British opinion both towards the Constitution and Europe\nmore generally;\n4. A country that sees itself distinct from Europe: perceived distinctiveness is important\nto understanding British public opinion on Europe; and\n5. An unimportant event: the referendum campaigns failed to capture the imagination of\nthe public.\nMethod\nWe present an overview of British public opinion towards the proposed Constitution using a series\nof opinion polls in the run-up to the French and Dutch votes. Analysis includes several nationally\nrepresentative surveys conducted by MORI in 2004\/5 on attitudes towards Europe\/EU constitution\nfor Citigroup, the Foreign Policy Centre, The Institute for Citizenship, The Observer, The Sunday\nMirror and The Sun. In addition, survey research conducted by ICM, NOP, Populus and other\nBritish polling firms, as well as the regular Eurobarometer series, were all examined and related to the\nMORI data. We also synthesised the views of several key opinion leaders associated with the \u201cYes\u201d\nand \u201cNo\u201d campaigns, including a former senior executive of Britain in Europe (BIE); a\nspokesperson for The No Campaign; a director of a leading think tank, a member of the No 10\n2Policy Unit, and a leading newspaper political editor using interpretive depth interviews. All\ninterviews were conducted in situ, in London, lasting between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. We sought\nto improve the validity of the interview data by interviewing the respondents in situ (de Ruyter and\nScholl, 1998), and taping and transcribing key verbatim comments and themes from the interviews\n(Perakyla, 1997), which are presented in the following text. Some of the interpretations we outline\nare shared by more than one of the various anonymous experts.\nTheme 1: A sceptical view of the Constitution\nBritish public opinion toward the Constitution was sceptical. Between April 2004 and June 2005,\nfourteen British opinion polls were conducted to measure public acceptance of the European\nConstitution in Britain. Unfortunately, several different question wordings were used hindering\ndirect comparison of the survey results. When the UK government announced the wording that\nwould be used in the actual referendum ballot paper in January 2005, several subsequent polls used\nthis exact referendum wording, even though in normal circumstances such a question wording\nwould not be acceptable in opinion research surveys.1 Despite this important distinction, the results\nof the surveys show a very consistent pattern. Over the fourteen month period from April 2004 to\nJune 2005, not one opinion poll showed more people intending to vote to accept the Constitution\nthan to reject it, as illustrated in Figure 1.2\nNevertheless, public opinion on this issue was not static. For the second half of 2004, the\nmomentum moved towards acceptance rather than rejection. The narrowest gap between the \u201cyes\u201d\nand \u201cno\u201d shares was recorded by ICM in January 2005, showing 49% in favour compared to 51%\nagainst3. ICM also conducted a split sample methodology on 2-3 February 2005, on behalf of Vote\nNo, which showed the importance of the wording in referendums, although obviously artificially\nconducted as an opinion poll. Using the referendum question, 39% said the UK should approve\nthe treaty; compared with 26% who said they would vote \u201cyes\u201d, using ICM\u2019s standard \u201creferendum\ntomorrow\u201d question4. This was the high point for the \u201cYes\u201d campaign. All polls conducted after\nJanuary 2005 showed a steady polarisation of public opinion. The result of a survey in June 2005\nby Populus5 gave similar results to the first poll on this topic in April 2004 by YouGov.6\n1 The government question wording used for the referendum would have been \u201cShould the United Kingdom approve\nthe treaty establishing a Constitution for the European Union\u201d.\n2 To help comparability between these polls we have excluded from the calculations any \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d and rebased the\nanswers to give a simple \u201csupport\u201d and \u201coppose\u201d finding that equals 100%. All results are shown using the Government\nstyle referendum question wording, with the exception of those marked with an asterisk which followed more traditional\nopinion poll style wordings.\n3 ICM interviewed 532 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 26-27 January 2005 for The Sunday Telegraph, see the\nfollowing website for details: http:\/\/www.icmresearch.co.uk\/reviews\/2005\/Sunday%20Telegraph%20-\n%20Opinion%20Poll\/SundayTelegraph%20Opinon%20Poll.asp.\n4 See ICM poll for Vote No, 3-4 February 2005.

Nevertheless, as many as 67% of Britons said they still wanted a\nchance to vote on the Constitution, irrespective of the referendum results elsewhere7.\nTheme 2: A persuadable electorate\nMost polls presented the results of public opinion as percentages of those supporting or opposing\nthe Constitution, with some also showing \u201cundecided\u201ds or \u201cdo not care\u201d by presenting a don\u2019t know\noption. However, these simple \u201csupport\/oppose\u201d formats provide no opportunity to uncover how\nstrongly these attitudes were entrenched. Sir Robert Worcester (MORI\u2019s founder) devised a\nquestion, first developed for explaining the strength of attitudes towards membership of the EU and\nthe Single Currency, to distinguish between those whose views on the Constitution were set and\nthose who report themselves to be open to persuasion. It was adapted in July 2004 to determine\nattitudes towards the Constitution in a study conducted for Britain\u2019s Foreign Policy Centre (see Gill,\nAtkinson and Mortimore, 2004) and repeated on three separate occasions providing an indication of\nthe direction of change, as well as depth of feeling, for different attitudinal segments (Table 1).\nBy segmenting the public in this way, we define three groups. The first are those most strongly\nsupportive of the Constitution, not open to persuasion about changing their views. We call this\ngroup, Committed Europhiles, because their support for the Constitution appears to indicate their\ndeepening desire for European integration. Over the period of July 2004 to April 2005, this group\naccounted for 9% of the adult population (+\/- 1%), form the bedrock of the \u201cyes\u201d campaign, and is\nthe smallest of the three key segments, remaining consistent in size throughout the period of study.\nThe second group are most opposed to the Constitution, holding their views so strongly that they\nsaid they were not open to persuasion. We call this group, Committed Europhobes, for the opposite\n7 MORI poll for The Sun See http:\/\/www.mori.com\/polls\/2005\/s050601.shtml\n4reason as that cited above for the Europhiles. This group was both greater in size than the first, and\nincreased in size during the time period. In July 2004, 27% of the British public said they were\nstrongly opposed to Britain adopting the new European Constitution (three times the 8% who were\nstrongly in favour). By April 2005, over a third (36%) of Britons claimed to have made up their\nminds to oppose the Constitution (four times the proportion strongly in favour). The negative shift\nin public opinion during that time probably justifies the claim that the \u201cNo\u201d campaign was better\norganised and effective in the preceding months than the \u201cYes\u201d campaign.\nTable 1: British Attitudes and Persuadability on the EU Constitution\nQ1 Which of the following best describes your own view of whether Britain should adopt the\nnew European Constitution?

They are the most important block of citizens. When they are combined, they\nrepresent the largest segment and are most susceptible to attitude change. They admit they would be\nprepared to change their views on the Constitution if they thought it was good or bad for Britain. In\nall four of the opinion polls outlined above, roughly half the general public (47%) identified\nthemselves as \u201cwaverers\u201d. Excluding the first survey, more of this group tended towards opposing\n(Europhobe group) than supporting the Constitution (Europhile group). In April 2005, 27% were\ngenerally opposed and 20% were generally in favour of the Constitution.\nDespite the fact that the opinion polls showed the \u201cno\u201d campaign attracting more support than the\n\u201cyes\u201d campaign, the British public reported themselves to be open to persuasion on the EU\nconstitution, awaiting the arguments of both campaigns when a referendum date was announced,\nand a full referendum campaign contested. Profile analysis of the persuadable segment indicated\n5they are most likely to be female, young or middle-aged (less than 55 years old), and of middle class\nsocio-economic grouping (ABC1). Older citizens were significantly more likely to be Europhobic on\nthe Constitution.\nTheme 3: A largely under-informed public\nThe British public\u2019s sense of being ill-informed about the European Union, is replicated in its\nperceived knowledge of the Constitution. In July 2004, a MORI survey for The Institute for Citizenship\nfound that 82% of adults felt that they did not have enough information to make a considered\nchoice about the Constitution.8 Almost a year later, in another MORI survey for Britain in Europe9\njust one in five people said they know a fair amount (18%) or a great deal (1%) about it; and just one\nin nine people (11%) said they felt they had enough information to make their minds up on how to\nvote although in the latest MORI poll as many as 45% of the public say they held their views so\nstrongly on the Constitution that they were not open to persuasion to change their minds!\nSurvey research consistently finds that the more informed a person is, or feels (s)he is, about an\norganisation, institution or individual, the more favourably disposed they tend to be about it. Thus,\nperhaps few supported the Constitution in Britain because few members of the public understood\nwhat it meant. Nevertheless, when the campaign proper began, they may have been persuaded to\nsupport it. The \u201cNo\u201d campaign however claimed the exact opposite, that the more people know, the\nmore likely they are to be against. The media also recognised their role in informing the public about\nthe Constitution, although a senior journalist told the authors that the EU has more perceived\nweaknesses than strengths, which makes it harder to inform readers about the pro-Constitution side\nof the argument, although the public see the common EU passport and free trade positively. The\nFrench may be better informed than the British, since a copy of the Constitution was made available\nto them and they still voted no, although they may not have actually read it. A No Campaigner\ncommented \u201cyes\u201d campaigners faced difficulty because the British know what they don\u2019t want from\nEurope but they don\u2019t know what they do want.\nMany negative myths about the impact of the Constitution appear widespread. A MORI\/Britain in\nEurope survey, conducted just before the French referendum, found that over half the British public\nbelieved that adopting the Constitution meant that the UK would: have to join the Euro (56%), lose\ncontrol over setting its own taxation (55%); and lose control over its foreign policy (54%).\nIncredibly, one in four Britons agreed that if UK approved the Treaty, it would mean \u201cThe Queen\nwill no longer be Head of State\u201d10.\nTheme 4: A country that sees itself distinct from Europe\nLatest Eurobarometer surveys record 62 per cent of Britons as thinking of themselves as \u201cBritish\nnot European\u201d, the highest level among the EU15 average of 40 per cent (Eurobarometer, 2003). In\nthe same survey, 55 per cent of Britons declared themselves \u201cvery proud to be British\u201d, compared to\nthe French and Germans who recorded 38% and 19% respectively on this item. When questioned in\na MORI poll for The Institute for Citizenship, only 1 in 10 Britons (10%) felt that Britain needs the EU\nmore than the EU needs it. 1 in 3 Britons (32%) felt that the EU needed Briton more than vice\nversa and another 1 in 3 Britons (32%) felt that they needed each other equally. 1 in 7 Britons (14%)\nfelt that the two institutions could do without each other altogether. Britons feel \u2018superior\u2019 to the\nEU. This feeling of distinctiveness perhaps goes some way in explaining the greater support for the\nprinciple of a Constitution for the European Union, when measured by the Eurobarometer surveys.\n8 MORI research for The Institute for Citizenship, www.mori.com\/polls\/2004\/ifc.shtml\n9 MORI research for Britain in Europe (June 2005).\n10 See http:\/\/www.britainineurope.org.uk\/\n6These findings do not contradict the polling by the British pollsters (as illustrated in Figure 1),\ninstead they reinforce the argument that many Britons believe that what applies to a \u201cdistant\u201d Union\ndoes not necessarily have an impact in their own country.\nTheme 5: An unimportant event:\nGenerally, the British people do not want more integration with Europe and more political decisions\nbeing taken by Europe (Eurobarometer, 2005), at least partly because they feel that Europe has little\nrelevance in their lives, and does not make policy and law in the interests of the British people. The\nBritish public\u2019s acceptance that it has a low degree of knowledge of Europe\u2019s political institutions\nhas several implications. First, it may lead to an underestimation of the EU\u2019s real importance,\nthereby reducing the issue\u2019s salience (and feeding a vicious circle of further reluctance to find out\nmore about it). This is recorded in MORI\u2019s regular tracking of the public\u2019s perception of the most\nimportant issues facing the country. Europe is rarely seen as one of the top half a dozen key issues\nfor the nation, decreasing markedly since early 2003 in salience compared to other issues. MORI\ndata for July 2005 showed 7% of the public saying Europe was one of the most important issues,\nmaking it joint 9th highest along with the environment and poverty\/inequality. It was at its highest in\nJune 2005 after the budget row between Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac which saw 19%\nof the public citing Europe as a key national issue. Indeed, more people thought Europe was an\nimportant issue at this point than they did during the European Parliament elections in June 2004\n(16%).11 Second, low knowledge may imply a low level of engagement with European political\ninstitutions, and low turnout at European elections, and perhaps at referenda. The UK\u2019s record of\nparticipation in European elections is clear evidence of this happening (24% turnout in 1999, easily\nthe lowest of the EU 15 nations and substantially lower than the EU average of 49%; with an\nincrease to 39% in 2004 through a combination of all-postal ballots and combining with local\nelections in some regions).\n11 MORI Political Monitor http:\/\/www.mori.com\/polls\/trends\/issues.shtml\n7Figure 2: Europe\u2019s Perceived Impact on the British Public\nThe idea that Europe is not an important issue reflects a perception that the EU itself is not\nimportant. In MORI\u2019s Audit of Political Engagement survey at the end of 2003, the European Union is\nseen as having less impact on people\u2019s everyday lives than either national or local political\ninstitutions, and less than the media and business, as illustrated in Figure 2.12 It may be equally that\nBritons perceive the Euro to be equally irrelevant to their lives, since the British economy has done\nwell outside it, and this may have given the British more self-confidence in their Eurosceptic nature\nas a result, according to the No Campaign spokesperson.\nDiscussion: implications for understanding opinion on the referendum\nOpinion poll data and analysis goes only so far in understanding how the British public would have\nvoted in a referendum on the EU Constitution. The public take actual voting in elections or\nreferenda more seriously than they do when giving answers to opinion pollsters. Despite this, our\narticle aims to highlights three key implications for any future European-related referendum\ncampaign:\nImplication 1: The need to convince the public of the importance of the decision\nOne key argument of the \u201cyes\u201d campaign was that if the British public believed voting against the\nConstitution meant a renegotiation of Britain\u2019s membership, or withdrawal from the Union, that this\nwould lead to a upsurge in support for the Constitution. This theory was premised on the belief that\nmost other European countries would have ratified the Constitution before the UK voted and, thus,\nthe British \u201cyes\u201d campaign would benefit from a domino effect. If only Britain rejected the\nConstitution, the \u201cno\u201d campaign would then have had to explain the consequence of Britain being\nthe only country to reject the Constitution. In this scenario, many \u201cyes\u201d campaigners believed this\nwould have exposed a division within the \u201cno\u201d camp: 1) those who would argue that a UK \u201cno\u201d\nwould mean the failure of the Constitution and 2) those who wanted to use this as an opportunity\nfor Britain to withdraw from the Union. A No.10 spokesperson believed that the many Britons\n12 Source: Audit of Political Engagement (The Electoral Commission\/Hansard Society). Fieldwork December 2003;\npublished March 2004. See http:\/\/www.electoralcommission.org.uk\/templates\/search\/document.cfm\/9273\nSource: MORI\/The Electoral Commission\/Hansard Society\n8%\n17%\n22%\n25%\n30%\n41%\n47%\n52%\n% of population\nMedia\nLocal Councils\nBusiness\nWestminster Parliament\nPrime Minister\nCivil Service\nEuropean Union\nCabinet\nFrom this list which two or three of the following do you believe have the most impact on\npeople\u2019s everyday lives? You can select up to three options\nBase: 1,064 UK adults, 18+\n11-17 December 2003\n8would prefer to vote for an unloved constitution and the \u201cstatus quo\u201d rather than face the possibility\nof exclusion from the EU.\nMORI\u2019s July 200413 survey provides prima facie evidence that the hypothesis outlined above has some\nvalidity. More of the British public support membership of the EU (50%) than oppose it (41%), and\nsignificantly more favour membership than favour the Constitution. In contrast, the public were, on\nbalance, opposed to participation in the Single Currency (36% in favour vs. 56% against) and so\nthere would have been little mileage in linking the Constitution with the Single Currency for the\n\u201cyes\u201d campaign. The more valuable analysis, however, is to examine how views on all three of these\nissues interrelate.\nAmong those who were strongly against the Constitution, three quarters (74%) had also decided\nagainst the Single Currency and, somewhat fewer but still, 62% were strongly against British\nmembership of the EU. This finding has profound implications \u2013 the majority of those most\ncommitted against the Constitution were not opposed to it on some matter of detail nor was their\nopposition based on the principle of having a Constitution or not. They were opposed to it on the\nvery principle of British membership of the EU. This evidence suggests there is, in theory at least,\nthe possibility of breaking the \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d to the Constitution bloc by a campaign which\npersuaded them that a \u201cno\u201d vote would lead to Britain leaving the EU, but perhaps not in sufficient\nnumbers to guarantee a victory. If this same proportion of those strongly against the Constitution\nwere strongly against EU membership (62%) in the latter April 2005 MORI poll, this would equate\nto at least four in ten of the British public who could be counted on to turn out and vote against the\nConstitution no-matter what the consequences for Britain as they are in principle opposed to British\nmembership of the Union in the first place.\nImplication 2: Segmentation is key\nSegmentation of likely voters based on their self-reported persuadability is fundamental in\nreferendum campaigns. Through this we learn two important facts:\ni) That even when a large proportion of the public say they are open to persuasion, as the\nBritish did despite their Euro-scepticism, the importance of the referendum campaigns\nbecome paramount.\nii) Among those committed to a position on one of the three European questions, they are\nmore likely to be committed to a Euro-sceptical (Europhobe) than a Europhile position,\nespecially with regards to the Constitution or the Single Currency. This provides any No\nCampaign with a much more comfortable position from which to begin a campaign.\nIt becomes imperative to examine the waverers\u2019 views on the Constitution in terms of their attitudes\ntowards EU membership. The majority were also wavering on EU membership (82%). In contrast\nto their views on the Single Currency, Constitution waverers were much more likely to be strongly in\nfavour of membership of the EU (14%) than strongly opposed (3%). As such, very few waverers are\ncommitted opponents to the Union. Crucially, this means that there is a qualitative difference\nbetween the majority of strong opposers of the Constitution and those who are generally opposed\nbut might change their minds. They differ not just in the strength of their views on the Constitution,\nbut on their whole approach to Europe. Two-thirds of the committed opponents are anti-EU in\nprinciple, whilst the same is true of only a tiny proportion of waverers.\n13 This survey asked respondents about their attitudes towards the Constitution, the Single Currency and membership\nof the Union, thus allowing cross-analysis of responses.\n9The implication for referendum campaigners is clear: the majority of strong opponents cannot be\ntreated as a more severe version of those who are generally opposed. They must be recognised as a\ndifferent species, and any desire to turn the Constitution (or for that matter the Single Currency)\nreferendum into a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU would likely enthuse this group\nto go out and vote, rather than to stay at home or even change their minds.\nImplication 3: Timing and domestic considerations\nThe leaders of The Yes Campaign believed that had the government offered its support, \u201cearly in\nthe first Blair government\u201d, they might have won a referendum on the Single Currency but the\nabsence of clear leadership from government made it difficult to raise funds and develop\npromotional campaigns. Conversely, The No Campaign could equally have entrenched the\nEurophobic attitudes of those over 55 years old, who we know from British general elections,\noutnumber those under 34 years old by two to one, and are twice as likely to vote in British general\nelections (Worcester, Mortimore and Baines, 2005). The French and Dutch referendums were\nregarded by some commentators as more a test of their government\u2019s domestic popularity rather\nthan their policies on Europe (Bickerton, 2005; Thornhill and Peel, 2005). The referendum results in\nHolland and France were an indication of their governments\u2019 unpopularity, according to Yes\ncampaigners. A key question for government political strategists was whether this would equally be\nthe case in Britain. A No.10 spokesperson suggested that the antithesis would be that in Britain the\ncampaign would have been fought on the issues of Britain\u2019s role in Europe and the world, not a\nreferendum on Blair\u2019s premiership, especially if UK was one of the last to vote on the issue.\nHow the public regard the status quo or the \u201csafe\u201d option is important to the success of any\nreferendum campaign. The determination of this fixed point position is important to political\nstrategists, and represents a political \u2018line in the sand\u2019, from which to benchmark their campaigns.\nSome in The No Campaign were confident of success because they felt Britons would see the\nConstitution as a step-change to greater integration. Some in The Yes Campaign were equally\nconfident of success, as they imagined that Britain\u2019s position in Europe would be put in jeopardy\nshould it be the only, and last, country to reject the Constitution. Either way, how a government\napproaches the issue at least partly depends entirely on how popular it is at the time a referendum\ncampaign is rolled out. An important lesson for future referendum campaigners, according to Yes\nCampaigners, is the strategic importance of timing, or what marketers refer to as \u201cstrategic\nwindows\u201d (Abell, 1978).\nConcluding Remarks\nIt is important to understand the underlying reasons for attitudes and opinions of the general public\ntowards referendums because the public take referendums more seriously than opinion polls. They\nconsider their positions more carefully, and are likely to maintain the status quo if they perceive that\nthere are risks to changing the situation. The marketing task for any referendum campaign which\nseeks to alter the status quo is to assuage public fears over such risks. Conversely, a referendum\nmarketing campaign which seeks to maintain the status quo can equally play on public fears of what\n\u2018will\u2019 happen in the event of change. In both cases, this status quo position, and exactly how that is\nconstituted in the public mind, serves as a benchmark for the referendum campaigns. In relation to\nthe British EU Constitution, whilst those opposed were a larger group than those in support, a\nmajority of the public reported themselves to be open to persuasion. Careful targeting in\ncampaigning may have turned the campaign either way, especially if a popular government had\nwholeheartedly supported a Yes campaign, with arguments proposed about the importance of the\nfuture membership of Europe. Cynics would say that Prime Minister Blair carefully sidestepped the\nConstitution issue by refusing to set a date for the British referendum until after it had been ratified\n10\nor otherwise by other key member state governments. He clearly understood well the strategic\nimportance of timing in referendums and the public\u2019s reluctance to alter the status quo.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thanks Sir Robert Worcester and Dr. Roger Mortimore for their helpful\ncomments on a draft of this paper.\nReferences\nAbell, D.F.
