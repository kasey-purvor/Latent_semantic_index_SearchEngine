In general terms, we now have a\npicture of how the nuclear shape varies across the Segre`\nChart. Nuclei near the closed shells are spherical. In\ncontrast, nuclei with valence nucleons in between two\nshells have deformed shapes with axial symmetry, and\nthe extent of the quadrupole deformation is quite well\ndescribed as being proportional to the product NpNn of\nthe numbers of pairs of valence protons (Np) and neutrons\n(Nn) [1]. This picture is underpinned by both the shell and\nmean field models of nuclear structure. Experiment and\ntheory concur that, as the NpNn parametrization would\nsuggest, nuclei rapidly deform as we add only a small\nnumber of valence nucleons to the magic numbers. Thus,\nnuclei in the middle of the f7=2 shell turn out to be\ndeformed even though the numbers of valence nucleons\nare relatively small.\nExperimentally, this picture is supported by a mass of\nindependent observations: the strongly enhanced quadru-\npole transition rates between low-lying states, the\nstrongly developed rotational bands built on low-lying\nstates, and measurements of ground state quadrupole mo-\nments. Where we have evidence of the shapes of ground\nand excited states in the same nucleus they are, in general\nbut not always, the same. It turns out that in some cases0031-9007=04=92(23)=232501(4)$22.50 \uf6d9The nuclei with N \u0006 Z and A \u0006 70\u201380 are of particu-\nlar interest in this context. Such nuclei enjoy a particular\nsymmetry since the neutrons and protons are filling the\nsame orbits. This, and the low single-particle level den-\nsity, lead to rapid changes in deformation with the addi-\ntion or subtraction of only a few nucleons. In terms of\nmean field models, these rapid changes arise because of\nthe proximity in energy of large energy gaps for protons\nand neutrons at Z;N \u0003 34 and 36 on the oblate side and\nZ;N \u0003 38 on the prolate side of the Nilsson diagram. As a\nresult, mean field calculations predict the existence of\nseveral energy minima with quite different shapes in\nsome of these nuclei [3,4]. Evidence of this coexistence\nhas been found, for instance, in Se and Kr nuclei [5,6],\nand it is also predicted for the lightest Sr isotopes [7].\nThus, it is of considerable interest to map out the defor-\nmation of the ground and excited states of nuclei in this\nregion. This is easier said than done, however. There are a\nnumber of methods to measure the deformation of the\nground state in unstable nuclei based on the interaction of\nthe electric quadrupole moment of the nucleus with an\nexternal electric field gradient [8,9]. These techniques are\nnot applicable to nuclei with J \u0003 0 or 1=2; moreover, they\nvery seldom give the sign of the quadrupole moment and,\nhence, cannot distinguish between oblate and prolate\nshapes.\nHere we present an alternative method to deduce2004 The American Physical Society 232501-1\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending11 JUNE 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 2376Sr, the most deformed nucleus in the region according\nto mean field calculations [4] and previous in-beam ex-\nperiments [10]. The method is based on an accurate\nmeasurement of the Gamow-Teller strength distribution,\nB\u0004GT\u0005, as a function of excitation energy in the daughter\nnucleus, and relies on the technique of total absorption\ngamma spectroscopy (TAgS) which will be explained\nlater. The theoretical idea was suggested by Hamamoto\net al. [11] and pursued by Sarriguren et al. [12]. According\nto them, one can study the deformation of the ground\nstate of a particular nucleus by measuring the B\u0004GT\u0005\ndistribution of its \u0004 decay. In these references, the authors\ncalculate the B\u0004GT\u0005 distributions for various nuclei in the\nregion for the deformations minimizing the ground state\nenergy. In some cases, the results differ markedly with\nthe shape of the ground state of the parent, especially for\nthe light Kr and Sr isotopes.\nA precise determination of the B\u0004GT\u0005 distribution is\nrequired for such studies and this is far from trivial.\nTraditional high resolution techniques, based on the use\nof high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors to measure\nthe \f rays emitted after the \u0004 decay, often fail to detect\nsignificant but very fragmented strength at high excita-\ntion energy in the daughter nucleus. This is mainly due to\nthree factors: the low photopeak efficiency of HPGe\ndetectors for high energy \f rays, the high fragmentation\nof the B\u0004GT\u0005 at high excitation energy, and the fragmen-\ntation of the gamma deexcitation of the levels in the\ndaughter through many different gamma cascades.\nTogether they cause the so-called Pandemonium effect\n[13]: Many weak cascades deexciting levels at high en-\nergy can remain undetected leading to large systematic\nerrors in the determination of the B\u0004GT\u0005. This is the\nreason why, even although Refs. [14,15] give the first\nindication of the prolate character of the 76Sr ground\nstate, one must determine the B\u0004GT\u0005 distribution more\naccurately over the whole QEC window to provide con-\nclusive proof.\nThe alternative, the TAgS technique, avoids these sys-\ntematic uncertainties. The basis of this method is the\ndetection of the entire energy of the gamma cascades\nrather than individual \f rays. For this purpose, one needs\na high efficiency detector with acceptable resolution for\ngammas such as the inorganic scintillators NaI(Tl) or\nBaF2. Furthermore, this detector must have a geometry\nas close as possible to 4\u000e to absorb the complete cascade\nenergy. If this is achieved, one can measure directly the\u0004\nintensity I\u0004\u0004E\u0005 as a function of the excitation energy in\nthe daughter nucleus, and from this one can extract the\nB\u0004GT\u0005 distribution.\nIn this Letter, we present the results of TAgS measure-\nments on the decay of the N \u0003 Z nucleus 76Sr. A com-\nparison of the results of this measurement with the\ncalculations of Ref. [12] allows us to establish the prolate\ncharacter of the ground state of 76Sr without ambiguity.\nWith the aim of measuring the \u0004 decay of nuclei far\naway from the stability line with the total absorption\n232501-2technique, a spectrometer called \u2018\u2018Lucrecia\u2019\u2019 has been\ninstalled at the ISOLDE mass separator at CERN. It con-\nsists of a large NaI(Tl) crystal of cylindrical shape (L \u0003\n[ \u0003 38 cm) with a cylindrical hole ([ \u0003 7:5 cm) at\nright angles to the symmetry axis. The purpose of the\nhole is twofold: On the one hand, it allows the beam\npipe (coming from the separator) to enter up to the center\nof the crystal, thus allowing on-line activity of a very\nshort half-life (>5 ms) to be deposited here and mea-\nsured. On the other hand, it allows us to place ancillary\ndetectors inside for the detection of the positrons (\u0004\u0007\ndecay), electrons (\u0004\b decay), or x rays (EC process)\nproduced in the decay. Surrounding the whole setup, there\nis a shielding box 19 cm thick made of four layers:\npolyethylene-lead-copper aluminum (see Ref. [16] for\nfurther details).\nIn order to produce the nucleus of interest (76Sr), a\n52 g=cm2 Nb target was bombarded with a 1.4 GeV pro-\nton beam. The intensity was chosen to produce a counting\nrate of \u0006 3:5 kHz in the NaI crystal. In order to separate\nSr selectively, a fluorination technique was used [17]. The\nradioactive beam was steered to the detector setup and\nimplanted in an aluminized Mylar tape which was moved\nevery 15 s to transport the source to the middle of the\ncrystal and to avoid the buildup of the daughter activity\n[T1=2\u000476Sr\u0005 \u0003 8:9 s, T1=2\u000476Rb\u0005 \u0003 36:8 s]. During this 15 s\ncycle, the decay of the implanted radioactive source was\nmeasured. The \f rays following the decay (either by \u0004\u0007\nor by EC) were measured by the NaI(Tl) crystal and\nanalyzed without any condition on the ancillary detec-\ntors. However, these detectors were very useful for the on-\nline control of the measurement.\nIn ideal conditions, if the TAgS had 100% peak effi-\nciency over the whole energy range, the experimen-\ntal spectrum measured in the NaI(Tl) cylinder would\nbe the \u0004 intensity distribution I\u0004\u0004E\u0005 convoluted with\nthe energy resolution of the crystal and the response of\nthe detector to the positron when applicable. In re-\nality, the detector does not have 100% peak efficiency\nbecause of the dead material inside the spectrometer\n(the ancillary detectors) and the transverse hole. Conse-\nquently, the spectrum is modified by the response func-\ntion of the detector. In other words, the relationship\nbetween the quantity of interest, I\u0004\u0004E\u0005, and the experi-\nmental data d\u0004i\u0005 is\nd\u0004i\u0005 \u0003\nXjmax\nj\u00031\nR\u0004i; j\u0005I\u0004\u0004j\u0005\n\u0002\ni \t channel\nj \t energy bin\n\u0003\n: (1)\nIn order to obtain I\u0004\u0004E\u0005 from our data, we should solve\nEq.

This is not a trivial task because the response\nmatrix R\u0004i; j\u0005 cannot be inverted due to the fact that it is\nquasisingular in the sense that two neighboring columns\nare very similar. However, there is a set of algorithms that\nhas been developed to solve this kind of \u2018\u2018ill posed\u2019\u2019\nproblem. In Ref.

Here we have used the expectation maximi-\nzation algorithm [19] to obtain the I\u0004\u0004E\u0005 by unfolding the\nexperimental data. To calculate the response matrix\nR\u0004i; j\u0005, which is needed by the algorithm, we have used\nthe levels and branching ratios given in Ref. [15], and the\nGEANT4 simulation code. The analysis has been per-\nformed taking into account both the EC and \u0004\u0007 compo-\nnents of the decay. A more detailed explanation of the\nprocedure to calculate R\u0004i; j\u0005 and to analyze the data will\nbe given in a forthcoming article.\nThe best check one can perform to validate the result of\nthe analysis is to recalculate the experimental spectrum\nby multiplying the response function of the detector\n[R\u0004i; j\u0005 in Eq. (1)] by the resulting beta intensity I\u0004. If\nthe analysis is properly done, this recalculated spectrum\nshould be very similar to the real experimental spectrum.\nThe upper part of Fig. 1 shows the experimental spectrum\n(shade without line) overlaid with the recalculated one\n(dashed line). The agreement between the two spectra is\nvery good.\nThe I\u0004\u0004E\u0005 is the experimental result of this work;\nhowever, the physical information is carried by the re-\nduced transition probability B\u0004GT\u0005, which can be ex-\ntracted from the I\u0004\u0004E\u0005 using the expression\nB\u0004GT\u0005 \u0003 I\u0004\u0004E\u0005\nf\u0004QEC \b E\u0005T1=2 \n 6147\n\u0002\ngV\ngA\n\u0003\n2\n; (2)\nwhere the B\u0004GT\u0005 is averaged inside the 40 keV energy\nbin, and f\u0004QEC \b E\u0005 is the Fermi integral which carries\nthe information on both the phase space available in the\nfinal state and the Coulomb interaction.

The analysis gives a total B\u0004GT\u0005 of\n3:8\u00046\u0005g2A=4\u000e up to 5.6 MeVof which 57% is located in the\nresonance between 4 and 5 MeV. This resonance is weakly\nvisible in the almost structureless TAgS spectrum of the\nupper panel. Its large B\u0004GT\u0005 value is a consequence of the\nstrong dependence of the Fermi integral with the energy.\nAt lower energy, the marked B\u0004GT\u0005 to levels at 0.5, 1.0,\nand 2.1 MeV were already observed in [15], although\nthe B\u0004GT\u0005 values are in disagreement with our results\ndue to the already mentioned Pandemonium effect. It\nshould be noted that the \u0004-delayed proton emission (Sp \u0003\n3:5 MeV) in this decay has been observed at excitation\nenergies from 4.8 to 5.8 MeV [14,15]. However, the con-\ntribution of this component is very small, of the order of\n2% in B\u0004GT\u0005, compared to the decay through the\n\u0004-delayed \f rays studied here.\nOne way to compare the results with the theory is to\naccumulate in each energy bin the sum of the B\u0004GT\u0005\nmeasured up to that particular energy. Figure 2 shows\nthis plot in which the experimental result is compared\nwith the theoretical calculations of Ref. [12] for both pure\nprolate and oblate shapes for the ground state of 76Sr. The\ngenerally accepted quenching factor of 0.6 has been ap-\nplied to the calculations.\nIn Ref.

The\nminima in the total HF energy versus deformation pa-\nrameter plot give the possible deformations of the ground\nstate.

Finally, the quasi-random-phase approximation\n(QRPA) equations are solved with a separable residual\ninteraction derived from the same Skyrme force used in\nthe HF calculation. For the B\u0004GT\u0005 calculation, the same\ndeformation is assumed for the ground state of the parent\nand for the levels populated in the daughter nucleus.\nFigure 2 shows the results using the residual interaction\nSK3. The agreement of the experimental results of this\nwork (squares in Fig. 2) with the prolate shape calculation\nof [12] is very good over the energy range 0\u20135.6 MeV. In\ncontrast, there is no similarity between the results of the\noblate calculation and the experimental points.\nThis agrees with the strong deformation (\u00042 \u0006 0:4) of\n76Sr already extracted from the dynamical properties\nobserved in in-beam studies [10]. It also gives the first\ndefinitive experimental evidence of the prolate character\nof the ground state deformation, confirming the result\nindicated in [14,15].\nWe should point out here that these results prove the\nvalidity of the method of deducing the sign of the electric\nquadrupole moment of ground states or \u0004-decay isomers\nfrom the study of their decay. This opens new opportu-\nnities for the study of nuclei far from the stability line\nwhere very often the first information comes from \u0004\ndecay (half-life, J\u000e . . . ). On the other hand, the theoreti-\ncal approach used in the present study has been thus far\nrestricted to nuclei in this region. The present work should\nencourage further theoretical studies in other regions of\nwell-deformed nuclei. It is worth noting here that QRPA\ncalculations have been successfully applied to describe\nother properties in nuclei with open shells where the\nnucleon pairing correlations are important such as\nB(E2) values [23] or giant resonances [24].\nFinally, as a part of this series of experiments, we have\nrecently published the results on 74Kr decay [16]. In that\npaper, a clear indication of shape mixing was deduced, a\nconclusion which is further corroborated by the present\nstudy which is free of shape admixtures.\nIn summary, in this Letter we present the results of an\nexperiment devoted to measuring the B\u0004GT\u0005 distribution\nin the decay of the N \u0003 Z isotope 76Sr.When we compare\nour experimental results with the theoretical calculations\nof Ref. [12], we conclude that the ground state of 76Sr is\nstrongly prolate (\u00042 \u0006 0:4), in agreement with theoretical\npredictions [4,7] and with previous experimental indica-232501-4tions [10,14,15]. An important consequence of the present\nwork is the validation of the method of deducing the\ndeformation, including the sign of the quadrupole mo-\nment, from the comparison of the \u0004-decay TAgS results\nand the calculated B\u0004GT\u0005 since the 76Sr ground state is a\nvery clean case, free of shape admixtures.\nThe authors feel especially grateful to J. C. Caspar,\nJ. Devin, G. Heitz, and C. Weber for all their invaluable\nwork on the mechanical mounting of the spectrometer\nand the setup of the data acquisition system.
