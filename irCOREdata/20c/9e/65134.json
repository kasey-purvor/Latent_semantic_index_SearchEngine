Based on ethnographic research conducted between 2006 and 2008, \nthis article examines the context for SFNEO\u2019s emergence at this time and in this \nregion of England, and the main policy and practice challenges it has faced in its \nearly years.  SFNE formed in a favourable political and cultural climate, although \nregional champions were crucial in setting it up.  It has worked well in branding itself \nand in taking advantage of the opportunity to lobby in support of comprehensive \nsmoke free legislation, although the success of the legislation presents a risk that \npeople will regard SFNE\u2019s work as finished.  There is a need for independent \nsustainable funding, strong partnership working, and the \u2018bringing together\u2019 of \nexisting organisations under its leadership if an organisation such as SFNE is to \nsucceed.  SFNE offers a model that is transferable to other places as well as to other \npublic health concerns such as alcohol, and has been taken up by public health \nplanners and policy makers with alacrity.  This indicates a general perception that \nSFNE plays an effective role in public health delivery. \n \n    \n \nThe evolution of a UK regional tobacco control office in its early \nyears: social contexts and policy dynamics \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nWhen it was launched on 31 May 2005, the Smoke Free North East Office (SFNEO) was the \nfirst tobacco control office of its kind in the UK (Fresh SFNE, 2006).  It offers a public health \ndelivery model that has generated considerable interest, not only for tobacco control but also \nas a way of tackling other issues such as alcohol and obesity.  This article looks at the \nformation and early years development of the SFNEO and Fresh - Smoke Free North East \n(SFNE - the regional tobacco control network that it coordinates).  Wanless (2002; 2004) and \nother key UK policy documents such as the government\u201fs Choosing Health (DoH, 2004; \nDoH, 2005) call for micro-level, real time studies of how decisions are made and the \nprocesses that underpin them.  This is the subject matter of this paper.  While the efficacy of \ncomplex interventions such as SFNE can be tested using evaluations based on health \noutcomes, the institutional and cultural contexts in which these interventions are carried out \nare less amenable to experimental manipulation but can be crucial for the effective translation \nof research into practice (Nutbeam, 1998; Campbell et al., 2007; Oldenburg et al., 1999; \nEckersley et al., 2001:285; Glasgow et al., 2003).  We look at how SFNEO has developed in \nits first few years, the international, national and regional contexts for this development, and \nsuggest principles from its early years\u201f experience that can be generalised to other areas. \n \nMETHODS \n \n    \n \nData for this article was collected between April 2006 and March 2008.  Ethnographic \nmethods were used to build up a detailed and comprehensive picture of the organisational \nculture and policy contexts in which the SFNEO, its director, two regional coordinators and \nother commissioned and administrative staff, operates.  Participant-observation of events was \nsupplemented by the analysis of relevant documents, and semi-structured interviews with key \nstakeholders \u2013 SFNEO staff, 15 of the 20 members of the SFNE Strategic Advisory Panel \n(SAP), eight of the nine other Regional Tobacco Programme managers (RTPMs), and four \nmembers of staff on the national tobacco team at the Department of Health.  Interviews were \neither face-to-face or by telephone, and the results recorded (with permission of the \ninterviewee), transcribed and analysed by coding into key topics identified by the research \nteam (Miles and Huberman, 1994).  Examples of participant-observational research activities \nincluded \u201edeep hanging out\u201f (Wogan, 2004) in the SFNEO, shadowing the director and other \nmembers of staff to observe the roles and relationships of the SFNEO with other bodies, and \nattending meetings of the various SFNE committees and those of related organisations.  \nResearch progress and outcomes were overseen and reflected upon by a multidisciplinary \nsteering committee which met at six weekly intervals.  Ethical approval for the research was \nobtained from the Sunderland NHS research ethics committee on behalf of the Central \nResearch Ethics Committee of the NHS.   \n \n \nRESULTS \nInternational, national and regional contexts \nThe initial inspiration for the development of a tobacco control office in the NE of England \nwas the experience of California where, since 1989, smoking rates had reduced to 14% \nthrough the principle of changing social norms so that tobacco became less desirable, \nacceptable and accessible (California Department of Health Services, 1998; CDC, 1999).  \n    \n \nHowever, the situation in the NE of England is different to that of California, and SFNE has \nnot slavishly followed the California model.  Other countries (e.g. Ireland in March 2004 and \nScotland in March 2006) had introduced tobacco control measures in advance of England, \nwhere smoke free public places legislation came into force in July 2007.  Active tobacco \ncontrol lobbies also existed in Australia, where the director of the SFNEO had worked for \nseveral years, and New Zealand (Studlaw, 2005).   \nThe national context was also important.  In 1997, a new Labour government was \nswept to power which, through its \u201eThird Way\u201f (Hale et al., 2004), sought to define itself as \ndifferent from what had gone before, including launching a new public health agenda.  For \nexample, the White Paper \u201eSaving Lives: Our Healthier Nation\u201f rejected \u201cthe old arguments \nof the past\u201d through altering the discourse from \u201ehealth variation\u201f to \u201ehealth inequality\u201f, and \nshifting the emphasis towards social, economic and environmental factors as determinants of \nill-health (DoH, 1999).  This orientation was also reflected in the Report of the Scientific \nCommittee on Tobacco and Health which highlighted the dangers of passive as well as active \nsmoking (DoH, 1998a).  Meanwhile the White Paper \u201eSmoking Kills\u201f highlighted the key role \nof smoking in shortening lives, and listed all the areas of concern which were subsequently to \nbecome the focus of SFNE\u201fs work (DoH, 1998b).  The NHS Ten Year Plan (NHS, 2000) \nintroduced the notion of National Service Frameworks (NSFs).  The NSF for coronary heart \ndisease (CHD) came out in the same year and highlighted smoking cessation services and \ntobacco advertising as two important areas for the prevention of CHD (DoH, 2000).  With the \nincreasing focus on its dangers, the idea of \u201econtrolling tobacco\u201f was no longer regarded as \nmaverick.  The UK Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act of 2003 banned most forms of \ntobacco advertising in print media, billboards, direct mailing and other promotions.  Although \nsponsorship of Formula One motor racing was allowed until July 2005, it appeared that the \npower of the \u201etobacco lobby\u201f, which had been a strong influence on policy in the 1980s, was \nwaning. \n    \n \n The changing political and health policy climate in England was conducive to the \nformation of a tobacco control office but does not explain why the North East of England was \nhome to the country\u201fs first such organisation.  The role of regional champions was crucial in \nthis regard.  Data presented at an NHS health promotion conference in 2002 showed that, if \nefforts to reduce smoking prevalence in the North East were limited to smoking cessation, it \nwould take decades to achieve the set targets (Milne, 2005), and indicated the need for new, \nmore comprehensive models of tobacco control.  The concept of a tobacco control office was \nparticularly attractive to those working in a region with a smoking prevalence rate of 28%, the \nhighest in the country (Chappel et al., 2006).  A major bid to the European Union Public \nHealth programme in 2003, supported by partners such as the Regional Development Agency, \nGovernment Office for the North East, the Association of North East Councils and the North \nEast Regional Assembly, argued that smoking was more than just an NHS issue.  Although it \nwas unsuccessful, interviewees suggested that the collaborating on the bid had a galvanizing \ninfluence on the individuals and organisations involved. \n SFNE thus reflects a move in both political and public health discourse away from an \nexclusive focus on smoking cessation towards more comprehensive, community-based and \npolicy-oriented strategies.  Examples from other parts of the world provided models and \napproaches that could be applied to the regional context of the North East of England, where \nindividual champions were particularly energetic and the needs particularly great. \n \nThe SFNE model \nThe SFNE model has not been formally articulated but emerged from our analysis of the \nethnographic and interview data.  The SFNEO is distinctive for the following reasons: \n1.  It brings together a diverse range of tobacco control activities - including education and \nmarketing, regulatory and policy measures, and cessation services - under one umbrella \norganisation with a common \u201ebrand\u201f and public face. \n    \n \n2.  In addition to the money received from the Department of Health (DoH) as part of its \nnormal regional tobacco programme management functions, it receives additional funding \nfrom the sixteen Primary Care Organisations (PCOs) in the region, based on a formula of \n\u00a30.32p per head of population.  This has boosted its income nearly fivefold each year (2005-\n8). \n3.  It maintains an identity that is separate from the NHS, despite its funding.  This is \nunderscored by its location in government offices in the centre of the region and by its \ngovernance arrangements. \n4.  It promotes social norm change (the \u201edenormalization\u201f of tobacco) rather than smoking \ncessation as its core strategy. \n5.  Its quasi-independence gives it scope to act as a lobbying organisation.   \n \nThe SFNE model in practice \nThe SFNEO\u201fs work is overseen by the SAP, made up of 18 people who represent a range of \nstatutory and voluntary sector agencies and organisations, only a minority of which are NHS.  \nIt is chaired by the regional director of public health, a joint civil service\/DoH appointment.  \nThe management committee (which scrutinises the budget) is chaired by a member of the \nLocal Authority Chief Executives\u201f Group, while regional universities as well as NHS and \nDoH-funded research and evaluation bodies are represented on the Intelligence sub-\ncommittee.  Such a broad and diverse grouping of leaders is unusual for public health delivery \nand reflects the wider constituency from which its identity derives. \nSFNE works to a Regional Tobacco Strategy that broadly derives from a DoH \ntemplate and provides eight key areas for action (Table 1).  Its average total income of \n\u00a3810,483 (+\/- 5%) over the three years has made a big difference to the scope of SFNE\u201fs \nwork and what it has been able to achieve, particularly with regard to items \u201e1\u201f and \u201e4\u201f of the \nstrategy.  One eighth of the Office\u201fs first year budget was allocated to establishing a public \n    \n \nface and key messages for SFNE.  An external integrated media agency with extensive \nexperience in social marketing was commissioned to undertake brand development.  The \nrationale for using a media agency in this way, as articulated by a member of the SAP, was \nthat enthusiasm and interest in tobacco control alone does not necessarily generate or translate \ninto the specific marketing skills required for an organisation such as SFNE to flourish.  Key \ncommunication principles the media agency established were for SFNE to be seen as \u201eanti-\nsmoking, not anti-smoker\u201f, and for its logo to allow both regional and local identities to be \nrepresented.  Thus \u201eFRESH\u201f was chosen as the umbrella title, with \u201eSmoke Free North East\u201f \nor \u201eSmoke Free (place name\/agency\/activity)\u201f underneath it (Figure 1). \nMedia expertise of this sort is traditionally held at arms length by the NHS.  Its use \nwas particularly significant when the Health Improvement and Protection Bill was announced \nby the Government in May 2005, offering the chance for a comprehensive ban on smoking in \nenclosed public places and workplaces.  Such an outcome was not a foregone conclusion, \nhowever; the government initially proposed exempting private members\u201f clubs and licensed \npremises that did not prepare or serve food (\u201ewet pubs\u201f) from the legislation.  An even weaker \noption contained in the Bill was that of devolving the decision about whether or not to go \n\u201esmoke free\u201f to local authority level.  The consultation on the smoke free elements of the Bill \nran from June to September 2005, during which period the SFNEO was heavily involved in \nlobbying.  Interviews with the other RTPMs highlighted that their appointments were as civil \nservants which denied them the chance for such overt political engagement.  SFNE, in \nreceiving the bulk of its funding from local PCOs rather than central government, was in a \ndifferent position with regards to what it could or could not do. \n SFNE commissioned a region-wide survey in May 2005 which found that 52% of \npubs in the North East were \u201ewet\u201f and hence would be exempt if the Government\u201fs favoured \noption were accepted; in Easington, the sixth most deprived local authority in England, the \nfigure was 81%.  SFNE encouraged North East PCOs, local authorities and key regional \n    \n \nagencies to write declaring their support for a comprehensive ban.  Sources in the DoH report \nthat responses to the Health Bill triggered by SFNE were second only to those from \nsupporters of Cancer Research UK.  The majority of the region\u201fs 30 MPs originally favoured \nthe Bill\u201fs weaker options but, after SFNE\u201fs lobbying, two-thirds (20) voted for the \ncomprehensive ban.  SFNE also found increasing public support for this measure \u2013 70% of \nNorth East adults supported smoke-free legislation by the time the Bill was passed in its \ncomprehensive form, compared to 63% in 2003 (Heywood et al., 2003).  Documentary \nsources monitoring compliance with the smoke-free legislation indicate a 98.7% compliance \nrate, the highest in the country (DoH, 2008).   \n The successful lobbying by partners for a comprehensive ban was the first such \nexperience for many, and media training was provided.  Interviews with the SAP members \nsuggested this task-focussed activity helped establish a \u201ecampaigning mentality\u201f and strong \nsense of dynamism, energy and positive affect unique in their experience of partnership \nworking (Heckler and Russell, 2008).  However, the unexpected emergence and success of \nthe Health Bill presented both an opportunity and a threat for SFNE in the longer term.  It was \nhelpful insofar as it provided an instant, emotionally charged \u201eissue\u201f, which drew partners \ntogether in powerful ways that many found unexpected and exciting.  However, success of \nthis sort also proved challenging since, following the introduction of a comprehensive ban on \nsmoking in enclosed public places on July 1\nst\n 2007, there was a risk that SFNE\u201fs task would \nbe regarded as finished.  However interviews with SFNEO staff and SAP members reflected \ntheir view that their job had only just begun.  With a national Public Service Agreement \naimed at reducing overall smoking prevalence to 21% by 2010, and other targets to reduce \nmajor inequalities in smoking prevalence similarly far from being achieved, there was still \nmuch to do.  SFNEO staff have made progress in identifying new issues, such as the \nchallenge of cheap and illicit tobacco.  Participant-observation showed the galvanising effect \nof a North of England summit on tobacco smuggling held in Newcastle on December 7\nth\n 2007 \n    \n \non this work, with over 250 people in attendance.  However, others who lack the vantage \npoint of the SFNEO\u201fs staff need to be drawn into tackling issues such as this with similar \nzeal. \n Bringing all tobacco control activities under one umbrella organisation has sometimes \nbeen problematic.  One issue that the SFNEO faced initially was its somewhat difficult \nsituation vis-\u00e0-vis the Regional Tobacco Control Alliance, a collection of individuals with an \ninterest in tobacco control established voluntarily in 1996 with intermittent DoH funding.  \nThe SFNEO took over much of the coordination and strategic planning work of this alliance, \nwhich seriously limited the latter\u201fs role and caused some early years friction which needed \ncareful \u201echange management\u201f.   \nAnother problem for SFNE in its early years has been ensuring its financial \nsustainability during a period of major NHS reorganisation (Hunter and Marks, 2005).  Public \nhealth work like tobacco control needs long-term funding to ensure results, and SFNE was \nfortunate in being independent of the NHS during the considerable stress and uncertainty that \naccompanied this reorganisation.  During discussions in the planning phase of the SFNEO it \nhad been proposed that the organisation should be part of an NHS PCO.  In retrospect, given \nthe subsequent reorganisation of primary care, such a move would have been disastrous for \nSFNE\u201fs sustainability and effectiveness.  SFNE suffered from the NHS reorganisation and the \nconsequent interregnum that occurred in 2005\/6 when it was announced that the two Strategic \nHealth Authorities in the North East were to be merged into one, and a new regional director \nof public health was awaited.  Some PCOs challenged the continuation of annual per capita \nfunding beyond 2005\/6, even though the amount sought was less than a third of their annual \nsmoking cessation budgets.  In such circumstances, strong leadership and negotiating skills \nwere needed from the new regional director of public health (the person ultimately \nresponsible for \u201esigning off\u201f the public health activities of PCOs in the region) who took up \nhis post in July 2006.  A dip of seven percent in the total amount given by PCOs in 2006-7, \n    \n \nfor example, (\u00a3657,275 down to \u00a3608,668) was due to one choosing to make its contribution \n\u201ein kind\u201f.  There were discussions at some meetings about the more radical possibility (in \nhealth terms) of local authorities taking over or contributing to the funding stream currently \nprovided by the PCOs, but achieving agreements on \u201eequal buy-in\u201f from local authorities \nproved even more difficult than it was from PCOs.  The regional director of public health \nsubsequently gave a commitment that all PCOs were to continue their per capita support of \nSFNE for three years from April 2008. \nSFNE, then, demonstrates unique features in terms of its funding streams, unusual \npartnerships for public health delivery, its focus on broader issues than purely smoking \ncessation services, and how it delivers on these concerns.  It provides leadership and the \npotential for long-term, steady progress on the twin tasks of denormalizing tobacco and \nsignificantly reducing smoking prevalence without being derailed by the turmoils of \nreorganisation all too familiar in the NHS.  The alternative (and the norm in many other areas \nof public health work, as several interviewees described it) is a preoccupation with regularly \nchanging, immediate problems, targets and workforce planning (i.e.  \u201ewho does what and in \nwhat way?\u201f rather than \u201ewhat are we trying to achieve and for whom?\u201f), often to the detriment \nof longer term issues. \n \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n We have identified the significant political and policy contexts that led to the \nformation of SFNE in the North East of England, and the key successes and challenges of its \nearly years.  A number of high profile national organisations have explicit interests in tobacco \ncontrol, for example the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), and \nAction on Smoking and Health (ASH).  There have also been a number of alliances of \n    \n \nagencies that have been pro-active in co-ordinating tobacco control activities, particularly at \nregional levels (for example, Smoke Free London).  However, our research suggests the \nSFNEO is unique in terms of its multiple sources of statutory funding and its ability to act as a \nquasi-independent, campaigning organisation able to bring unusual partners together to lobby \nwhere other organisations and individuals might otherwise have been prevented or \ndiscouraged from doing so.  Its focus on social norm change, manifested through its extensive \nuse of media agencies and social marketing, has been another unique and pioneering feature \nof SFNEO in its early years.  As the delivery mechanism for a large-scale tobacco control \nprogramme that brings all aspects of tobacco control under one umbrella, SFNEO provides \nleadership, accountability, and an organisational structure for the evidence-based achievement \nof a range of measurable outcomes (Nutbeam, 1998) that commissioners\/funders can \u201ebuy \ninto\u201f with relative confidence.  The partnerships that have developed around SFNE extend \nwell beyond the normal boundaries of NHS working, are dynamic in how they operate, and \nare charged with positive affect (Heckler and Russell, 2008).  The office has been able to \nachieve some durability and direction during a time of upheaval and reorganisation within the \nNHS, and has developed strong and dynamic partnerships amongst an unusually broad range \nof groups and individuals.  It now has to channel the energies generated during its highly \nsuccessful lobbying for the smoke free legislation of July 1\nst\n 2007 into new challenges that \ncontinue to demonstrate the appropriateness of its unique modus operandi for these tasks.  \nThe established partnerships will need to grow and develop further as the focus and action \npriorities of SFNE alter to sustain this momentum.  There is evidence that this is happening \nalready, with the increasing involvement of revenue and border control agencies in the \nstrategies on cheap and illicit tobacco (HM Treasury, 2006) one of the issues that SFNE is \ndrawing into the tobacco control agenda. \n There has been much research interest in policy networks in different social arenas \n(Rhodes and Marsh, 1992; Ryan et al., 2001).  According to an earlier study of the UK \n    \n \ntobacco policy network, SFNE should be part of a peripheral \u201eissue network\u201f surrounding a \n\u201eproducer network\u201f that is an amalgam of government and tobacco industry interests \nsurrounded by a public environment ambivalent about the smoke-free debate (Read, 1992).  \nThis contrasts with the findings of our study where, as in the USA (Krauss, 2004), the policy \ndynamic has shifted from tobacco networks to tobacco control networks.  SFNE is at the \ncentre of a complex partnership of organisations that contribute positively to debate and \naction on tobacco control in a public environment that is, in general, increasingly favourably \ndisposed towards the tobacco control agenda.  The arrival of the SFNEO has caused some \nexisting organisations that were already working at local or regional levels to feel \ndisenfranchized or disempowered, although the increased resources it has been able to put at \ntheir disposal and the centralised lobbying SFNE has been able to coordinate has softened this \nantipathy somewhat.  SFNE has also established itself as a key umbrella organisation at the \nnational level, although it remains dependent on sustained funding from its regional base. \nIt is too early, and not the purpose of this article, to measure many of the outcomes on \nwhich SFNE must ultimately be judged, although some (such as changes in public opinion \nand compliance rates with the new legislation) have been alluded to above.  Some measures, \nsuch as smoking prevalence data, will only assume significance over a period beyond the \nlifetime of our project and will not necessarily be directly attributable to SFNE anyway.  A \nmonitoring framework is in place which will start to yield results by 2010.  The ability to be \njudged against the delivery of such tangible outcomes is an achievement that is unusual in the \nfield of public health where delivery tends to be haphazard and piecemeal.  As such, the \nSFNEO may offer a model of organisation and leadership in public health that has \nconsiderable potential for application elsewhere.  Examples include use of the SFNEO model \nin establishing a NE office for Alcohol Control arising out of a Regional Alcohol Advisory \nGroup (NEPHO, 2006).  This new office has both similar funding arrangements and an \nemphasis on social marketing, lobbying and collective action by different public sector \n    \n \nagencies working in partnership.  Meanwhile two other English regions (North West and \nSouth West) have copied the SFNE funding, marketing and partnership model for their own \ntobacco control activities.  The interest in extending this organisational form into other areas \nand types of public health delivery is a tangible demonstration of the perception, across the \nregion and beyond, that the SFNE model is effective. \n \n \nFUNDING \n \nThis work was supported by the National Prevention Research Initiative (grant number \nG0501277).
