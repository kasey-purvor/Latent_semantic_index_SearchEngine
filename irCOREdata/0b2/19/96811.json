This is achieved by\nmutation of the genes encoding for the antibody\nand subsequent selection of those B cells which\nexpress B cell receptors with the highest affinity\nfor antigen (MacLennan et al., 2000).

Both processes are believed to take\nplace in the germinal centres of secondary\nlymphoid organs (Berek et al., 1991; Jacob\net al., 1991).\nUpon immunization (infection) the antigen is\nconcentrated in the secondary lymphoid organs\nwhere a small subset of all B cells recognize it\n(Goodnow, 1997). After successful presentations\nof antigen fragments to T cells, B cells enter the\nblast state (MacLennan et al., 2000). A subset\nof the antigen-specific B and T cells enter the\nfollicle and continue dividing about 4 times a\nday (Liu et al., 1991). After about 3 days B blasts\ndifferentiate into centroblasts which still divide\nevery 6\u20137 hr and after 4 days a spatial reorga-\nnization can be observed. It has been shown thatr 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.\nD. IBER AND P. K. MAINI154centrocytes are the progenitors of centroblasts\n(Liu et al., 1991). Centrocytes express B cell\nreceptors on their surface and are believed to be\nsubject to selection by antigen in the form that\nthey need to bind, internalize and present\nantigen to T cells (Lanzavecchia, 1985) in order\nnot to undergo apoptosis (MacLennan, 1994).\nThose centrocytes that successfully interact with\nT cells can either differentiate into memory or\nplasma cells (MacLennan, 1994). There is sub-\nstantial experimental evidence for a third differ-\nentiation pathway back into the centroblast state\n(de Vinuesa et al., 2000; Han et al., 1995; Liu\net al., 1991).\nSoon after the first differentiation of centro-\nblasts into centrocytes, somatic hypermutation\nstarts to act on centroblasts and leads to a\nchange in the affinity of the B cell receptors for\nantigen. About half of the mutations \u00f053%\u00de have\nbeen estimated to be of a silent nature not\nleading to any change in affinity (Shannon &\nMehr, 1999). About 28% have been estimated to\nlead to B cell death which is in good agreement\nwith the apoptotic cells observed in the dark\nzone where centroblasts proliferate (Hardie et al.,\n1993; Liu et al., 1991). Nineteen percent of all\nmutations have been estimated to have an effect\non affinity. This effect can either be of an\nimproving nature and drive affinity maturation,\nor of worsening or specificity changing character\nwhich may even lead to the formation of\nautoreactive clones. Selection is therefore clearly\nneeded.

Several studies support the\nconcept that antigen is presented on the surface\nof follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (Liu et al.,\n1989) and that this membrane presentation may\nlower the affinity threshold (Batista & Neuber-\nger, 2000) and the required amount of deposited\nantigen (Batista et al., 2001) such that early\nclones of low affinity can also successfully\nextract and present antigen. The threshold needs\nto be dynamic with respect to time in order to\ndrive affinity maturation. This dynamic nature\nmay derive from increasing competition between\ncentrocytes for free antigen which is probably\nreduced by antigen extraction (Batista et al.,\n2001) and masking through antibodies produced\nby early plasma cells (Ridderstad & Tarlinton,\n1998; Tarlinton & Smith, 2000). In Table 1, we\nsummarize the key stages of the primed primary\nimmune response.\nHow activation of B cells by antigen and T\ncells determines their fate, for example, whether\nthey differentiate into either centroblasts, mem-\nory or plasma cells, is currently unknown and\nthere is no experimental system available to\ninvestigate this. A mathematical model is there-\nfore helpful for investigating hypotheses and\nchecking their compatibility with available data.\nBefore investigating affinity maturation we\nfirst need to construct a model of the germinal\ncentre (GC) kinetics which reproduces all avail-\nable data on the relevant population dynamics\nthat are related to the GC reaction. Into this\nmodel the model of affinity maturation can thene 1\nprimary immune response\nReferences\nLiu et al., (1991)\nMacLennan (pers. comm., 2001)\nLiu et al.

Previous mathematical models\nof the process were very complex and unable\nto reproduce all data on the germinal centre\nreaction. An important condition for being able\nto construct a good model is the availability of\na large body of reliable experimental data. The\nmodel presented below is therefore constructed\nfor the primed, instead of for the true, primary\nimmune response, since more (and also more\naccurate) data are available for the former. In\nthe primed primary immune response an animal\nis first immunized with a precipitated carrier\nprotein that activates T cells. A month later the\nanimal is again immunized with the carrier\nprotein but this time it is conjugated to a hapten.\nA hapten is an agent that is too small to raise an\nimmune response but, when conjugated to a\ncarrier protein, it is recognized by the immune\nsystem and raises an immune response. It is\nimportant to note that the hapten\u2013carrier\nprotein complex can be injected in soluble form.\nThis leads to a faster clearance of the antigen\nfrom the body and a sharper response which\nallows a more accurate description of the process\nand therefore yields better data. The problem of\nmodelling the true primary immune response\nalready begins with deciding on the exact time\nof onset of the immune response, since this is\nsmeared over a time span of several days because\nthe antigen needs to be injected in precipitated\nform and dissolves slowly. A drawback of\nmodelling the primed instead of the true primary\nimmune response is that due to the priming,\nT cell help is non-limiting and the immune\nresponse against the hapten is faster and\nstronger than in the unprimed case. This is an\nunfortunate side effect since the mechanisms of\nthe two responses may therefore be different and\nan understanding of the artificial primed primary\nimmune response does not directly imply an\nunderstanding of the true primary immune\nresponse. Many features will however be similar\nalthough the kinetics differ (Liu et al., 1991) and\nan understanding of the primed primary immune\nresponse may therefore facilitate an understand-\ning of the true primary immune response. In the\nfollowing, a simplistic mathematical model is\ndevised with which all available data can be\nreproduced and predictions can be made con-\ncerning selection strategies and the regulation ofthe differentiation of selected centrocytes into\neither memory, plasma cells or centroblasts.\nThe Basic Model\nCalculations based on the emergence of\nantigen-specific B cells led to the suggestion that\nfollicles are seeded during the first hours of\ninfection (immunization in experiments) and\nthat each follicle soon becomes dominated by\nfive (or fewer) clones (Jacob et al., 1991; Kroese\net al., 1987; Liu et al., 1991). In the model it is\ntherefore assumed that the GCs are seeded\nby three clones which give rise to 12288 B blasts\nwithin 3 days if we use the proliferation rate r \u00bc\n24\n6:5 ln 2 day\n\u00041 for centroblasts determined by Liu\nand co-workers (Liu et al., 1991). At day 3, B\nblasts differentiate into centroblasts and the\nmain GC reaction starts. The model, presented\nschematically in Fig. 1, takes the form\ndB\ndt\n\u00bc prrCs \u0004 rB; \u00f01\u00de\ndC\ndt\n\u00bc 2rmB \u0004 mC with m \u00bc ds \u00fe dc\u00f01\u0004 s\u00de; \u00f02\u00de\ndCs\ndt\n\u00bc dsC \u0004 rCs; \u00f03\u00de\ndM\ndt\n\u00bc \u00f01\u0004 pr\u00derCs \u00f04\u00de\nand is derived in the following way. There is no\nexperimental work on the regulative mechanism\nfor differentiation of centroblasts into centro-\ncytes. In a previous model, Kesmir and de Boer\n(1999) assumed that centroblasts differentiate\ninto centrocytes after a set number of genera-\ntions n; which is larger than 4. One can show that\nother mechanisms, such as time-dependent or\ncell-density-dependent centroblast\u2013centrocyte\nconversion, cannot satisfy all experimental data\non population dynamics of certain B cell\nsubpopulations. In the case of a cell-density-\ndependent conversion mechanism, we find a\nnon-trivial stable steady state which is rapidly\nattained and prohibits termination of the re-\nsponse. This problem was encountered before\nby Oprea and Perelson who got around it by\nB blast\nBb\nCentro-\nblast\nB\nmemory\ncells &\nAFC\nAPOPTOSIS\nAPOPTOSIS\nselected\nCentro-\ncyte\nC\nCentro-\ncyte\nC\nday 3\npr\u03c1\n\u03c1\n(1-pr)\nd s\n\u03b4c(1-s)\n2\u03c1 (1-m)\n2\u03c1 m\nFig. 1. Scheme of the model for the primed primary immune response. Abbreviations are explained in Table 2.\nD. IBER AND P. K. MAINI156introducing a sudden emigration of GC cells at\nthe time when biologists measured the dissolu-\ntion of germinal centres (Oprea & Perelson,\n1997). This is, however, a phenomenological\napproach that cannot explain the underlying\nmechanism. The steady state can be circum-\nvented in the time-dependent conversion model\nbut only at the expense of losing another GC\nfeature: the model then does not reproduce the\nsudden loss of GCs when recycling is impaired\n(de Vinuesa et al., 2000). In this model we\ntherefore assume generation-dependent centro-\nblast differentiation and it will be shown later\nthat agreement with the experimental observa-\ntions of MacLennan and co-workers (MacLen-\nnan et al., 1990) only occurs if we assume that\ncentroblasts already differentiate into centro-\ncytes after one cell division.\nThe conversion of centroblasts into centro-\ncytes could involve only one or both daughter\ncells. However, in the former case we would\nnot obtain the observed GC kinetics since the\ncentroblast pool could only increase but not\ndecrease since no net outflux term would beincluded and the GC reaction would never\nterminate. Hence, in the model it is assumed\nthat centroblast division directly leads to differ-\nentiation of both daughter cells into centrocytes\nand we therefore have the term \u0004rB in eqn (1).\nDue to somatic hypermutation only the propor-\ntion m survives the cell division and differenti-\nates into centrocytes while the remaining\nproportion \u00f01\u0004 m\u00de of dividing centroblasts is\nassumed to die at the same rate as the surviving\npart differentiates. The death rate of centroblasts\nmay well be smaller than the conversion rate.\nSuch a possible difference cannot, however, be\nexpected to change the modelled kinetics sub-\nstantially if we assume that centroblasts, once\ncommitted to apoptosis, cannot take part in the\nnormal cell division process. A smaller death\nrate would therefore only lead to a slower decay\nof the total cell number. The surviving centro-\nblast proportion gives rise to the term 2rmB\nin eqn (2). The factor 2 comes in since one\ncentroblast gives rise to two centrocytes and\ndivision of centroblasts is assumed to lead\ndirectly to differentiation into centrocytes.\nTable 2\nParameters for the minimal model\nB Centroblasts\nC Centrocytes\nCs Centrocytes that have been selected\nM Memory cells\nAFC Antibody forming cells\nr \u00bc 24\n6:5 ln 2 Maximum proliferation rate of centroblast \u00f0day\n\u00041\u00de Liu et al.

This generates the term dsC\nin eqn (3). The other part \u00f0\u00f01\u0004 s\u00deC\u00de undergoes\napoptosis with rate dc (MacLennan et al., 1990)\nand the outflux from the centrocyte pool is\ntherefore in total \u00f0ds \u00fe dc\u00f01\u0004 s\u00de\u00deC; which is\nwritten as mC in eqn (2). The selected centrocytes\n\u00f0Cs\u00de can then take either of two routes: they may,\nwith probability \u00f01\u0004 pr\u00de; differentiate into mem-\nory \u00f0M\u00de or antibody-forming plasma cells \u00f0AFC\u00de\n(at this stage we do not differentiate between\nthese two cell types and denote both populations\nby M); or they may, with probability pr; recycle\nand replenish the centroblast pool. The time\nneeded to recycle is assumed to be, on average,\nabout 6 hr and therefore we again use r as a rate\nconstant, leading to the term prrCs in eqn (1).\nWe further assume that selected centrocytes\ndifferentiate at the same rate into memory or\nplasma cells as they recycle so that the net\noutflux term from the pool of selected centro-\ncytes is given by \u0004rCs in eqn (3). By the same\nargument, the influx into the memory pool (4) is\ngiven by \u00f01\u0004 pr\u00derCs: A different efflux rate from\nthe GC would only change the total number of\ncells fluxing into the memory and plasma cell\npool. Both numbers are currently unknown and\ndifficult to measure since both memory and\nplasma cells emigrate from the follicles and are\nthen difficult to track.Non-dimensionalization of the model does not\nlead to any new insight since the form of the\nequations remains unchanged (that is, there are\nno small parameters that we can exploit see Table\n2). We note that the M equation is decoupled\nfrom the rest of the system, so we analyze the first\nthree equations of the model system. This system\nalways has a trivial equilibrium point. A non-\ntrivial equilibrium point, exists if\nm \u00bc mc \u00bc 2prmsd: \u00f05\u00de\nAt the equilibrium point, s therefore takes the\nvalue\nsc \u00bc\ndc\nd\u00f02prm \u0004 1\u00de \u00fe dc\n: \u00f06\u00de\nGiven that the selection factor s can only take\nvalues between 0 and 1 in the model, we obtain\nas a further condition on the denominator\nprmX0:5 \u00f07\u00de\nin order to attain the equilibrium state within the\npossible parameter range. Due to somatic\nhypermutation the survival rate m has been\ncalculated to be about 0.72 (Shannon & Mehr,\n1999) or 0:75 (Allen et al., 1987). Other sources\nare more pessimistic and consider m \u00bc 0:5\n(Kepler & Perelson, 1993). For the latter\nparameter value of m we would need pr \u00bc 1 in\norder to meet condition (7). pr; however, cannot\nattain value 1 since then no memory cell\nD. IBER AND P. K. MAINI158formation would be possible, [eqn (4)]. We\ntherefore have m40:5 as a necessary condition\nfor a non-trivial equilibrium state. For mp0:5\nwe have m4mc for all parameters in the para-\nmeter range. Simple analysis shows that the\nsolution blows up for momc while for m4mc it\ntends to the trivial equilibrium point. If we use\nm \u00bc 0:72 on the other hand, we only need\nprX0:69 in order to attain a non-trivial equili-\nbrium state.\nResults and Predictions\nTERMINATION OF SOMATIC HYPERMUTATION\nAT DAY 16 REQUIRES ENHANCEMENT IN THE\nSTRINGENCYOF SELECTION\nExperimental observations show that the\noverall shape of the GC kinetics during the\nprimed primary immune response (Liu et al.,\n1991) is characterized by an exponential increase\nin cell numbers until day 3 or day 4, when the\nnumber of cells reaches about 1\u20131:5\b 104\n(Kuppers et al., 1993; Liu et al., 1991) followed\nby a halving of cell numbers until day 7. After\nday 7 cell numbers decline more slowly until the\nGC reaction finishes at about day 21 (Liu et al.,\n1991).\nIn order to model the decrease in cell numbers\nwe have to determine the set of parameters for\nwhich the model attains the trivial equilibrium\nstate. It is generally believed that the decrease in\ncell population during the GC reaction is mainly\ndue to non-selected centrocytes which are dying\n(MacLennan et al., 2000). It is further believed\nthat selection is critically dependent on the\namount of available antigen, which can be\nreduced during the reaction by antigen extrac-\ntion (Batista et al., 2001) and antigen masking\nthrough soluble antibody produced by early\nplasma cells (Ridderstad & Tarlinton, 1998;\nTarlinton & Smith, 2000). From the latter it\nfollows that the value of the selection factor will\nonly decrease during the GC reaction. The\nweaker decrease in cell numbers after day 7\nmust therefore be due to the increase of the other\nundetermined parameter, the recycling probabil-\nity pr: This assumption can be justified by the\nexperimental result that early clones of high\naffinity have been observed to preferentially\nleave the GC reaction. We will come back tothis point later. At this stage it is sufficient to\nassume that those centrocytes which receive a\nvery strong activation signal compared to the\naverage centrocyte population preferentially\nleave the GC reaction. Given that B cell and\nsubsequent T cell activation (interleukin-2\nproduction) is dependent on the availability of\nantigen (Batista et al., 2001), and given further\nthat the curve of T cell activation as a function\nof antigen density is of sigmoidal shape (Batista\net al., 2001), the behaviour can best be modelled\nby the use of a Hill function. We use\npr \u00bc 0:6\u00fe 0:2\nAgnmin\nAgn \u00fe Agnmin\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere Ag is antigen density, Agmin \u00bc 7500 and\nn \u00bc 50: The parameters Agmin and n are chosen\nsuch that the experimental kinetics can be\nreproduced.\nThe amount of unbound antigen decreases\nduring the GC reaction due to antigen consump-\ntion and masking by high-affinity soluble anti-\ngen. The latter will be included once we have\nmodelled affinity maturation. At this stage we\nonly consider antigen reduction by extraction\nthrough centrocytes. The initial number of\nantigen complexes in the lymph node has been\nestimated to be 5\b 108 (Tew & Mandel, 1979)\nalthough this number will vary between immune\nresponses (MacLennan, Pers. comm., 2001).\nGiven that every GC consists of about 1:5\b\n105 lymphoid cells and every spleen about\n5\u20137\b 107 lymphoid cells, the number of GCs\ncan be estimated to be about 300\u2013500. So there\nare at least 106 antigen molecules per GC. If we\nfollow the estimate in Kesmir & de Boer (1999)\nthere are 100 FDCs per GC and therefore on\naverage 104 antigen molecules per FDC.\nThe natural decay of antigen is more or less\nirrelevant since this natural decay is much slower\nthan all active processes. The antigen decay is\ntherefore probably mainly due to antigen ex-\ntraction by centrocytes. It is reasonable to\nassume that the more the extraction, the more\nthe centrocytes interact with antigen and the\nhigher is the antigen density on FDCs, since this\nmay facilitate extraction. Assuming further, for\nsimplicity, a linear influence, we are left with\n\u0004uCsAg as the term modelling the extraction by\nA MODEL FOR GC KINETICS 159selected centrocytes, where Ag is the antigen\ndensity. Given that centrocytes which do not\nmanage to become selected may extract antigen\nas well, we also need to take this proportion of\nnon-selected centrocytes into account. This cell\nproportion is taken to be k\u00f0C \u0004 Cs\u00de and we\ntherefore obtain the second term modelling the\nantigen dynamics to be \u0004uk\u00f0C \u0004 Cs\u00deAg yielding\nin total for the antigen dynamics\ndAg\ndt\n\u00bc \u0004\u00f0ukC \u00fe uCs\u00f01\u0004 k\u00de\u00deAg: \u00f09\u00de\nSince k is not known from experiments we\nassume, for simplicity, that k \u00bc 0: We can easily\nchange this once experimental data are available\nbut given that u and the initial and final antigen\ndensity are unknown it does not seem appro-\npriate to explore k at this stage. There is no\nevidence in the literature that the antigen\nconsumption rate depends on the quality of\nBCR:antigen interaction and u is therefore taken\nto be constant. The exact value of u \u00bc 2:5\b\n10\u00045particle\b cell\u00041day\u00041 was chosen with the\nresult in mind that within 30 days about half of\nthe antigen has disappeared from the lymph\nnodes (Tew & Mandel, 1979). Hence there is still\na lot of antigen available in the lymphoid organs\nwhen the GC reaction terminates and lack of\nantigen is therefore unlikely to be the primary\nreason for GC termination (as proposed pre-\nviously, Kesmir & de Boer, 1999). An alternative\nmodel (Meyer-Hermann et al., 2001) proposes\nthat GC termination is due to emigration of GC\nB cells as memory or plasma cells and this is the\nview that we will take. In the model of affinity\nmaturation we will see how antigen masking can\naffect selection and emigration which finally\nleads to GC termination. The results for this\nmodel can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 2. The\ntotal number of B cells peaks at day 4 with about\n1:2\b 104 B cells. This is in good agreement with\nthe experimental results of Liu and co-workers\n(Liu et al., 1991). MacLennan and co-workers\nfind that centrocytes greatly outnumber centro-\nblasts during the main part of the GC reaction\nand this is also found in the model results. We\nconclude from the results shown in Fig. 2 that it\nis sufficient to assume that the recycling rate can\nchange with respect to timeFwhile the selectionfactor can be kept constant \u00f0s \u00bc 0:28\u00deFin order\nto reproduce the experimental kinetics of the GC\nreaction.\nJacob and co-workers (Jacob et al., 1993)\ndeduced from their experimental results that\neither the selection stringency has to increase or\nsomatic hypermutation has to terminate at\nabout day 16. It is possible to enhance selection\nstringency (reduce s) in this model and still to\nreproduce the experimental kinetics (data not\nshown) but there is nothing that would justify\nthis. If, however, somatic hypermutation termi-\nnated at day 16 (as was proposed in Berek et al.,\n1991) then the somatic hypermutation survival\nrate would increase from m \u00bc 0:72 to 1. From\neqn (6) we see that sc decreases when m increases.\nUpon termination of somatic hypermutation the\nselection rate s therefore has to decrease in order\nto prevent the GC reaction from growing. As\ndiscussed above, the selection rate is believed to\ndepend on the amount of available antigen and\nthe behaviour can therefore best be modelled by\nagain using a Hill function.

MAINI160The Hill coefficient n is a measure of the\ncooperativity of a process and a Hill coefficient\nof 3 is already considered high (Stryer, 1995).\nThe reason such large values of the Hill\ncoefficient had to be chosen in this model is that\nthe selection rate and the recycling probability\nneed to change rapidly and we see from Fig. 2\nthat there is no alternative if we want to satisfy\nthe kinetic data. We have therefore to assume\nthat the fall of the selection factor is almost an\non\/off response where signalling is changed\nrapidly when the antigen density and affinity\nreaches a certain threshold. If we understand the\nrapid decrease in the selection proportion as an\neffect of a signalling cascade with many ampli-\nfication steps, a high Hill coefficient, which\nwould not be justifiable for single molecule\u2013\nmolecule interactions, can still be realistic. Such\na rapid change, however, makes the model very\nunstable against small variations in the initialconditions. When we include affinity maturation\nwe will be able to model the selection factor and\nthe recycling probability more mechanistically\nwithout having to use Hill functions, thus this\nproblem will not arise.\nThe middle panel in Fig. 2 shows the results of\nthe model which compare even more closely with\nthe experimental data (Liu et al., 1991) than the\nresults in the top panel, which were obtained for\ncontinuous somatic hypermutation and constant\nselection rate. In the following we will further\nexamine the benefits of termination of somatic\nhypermutation well before the end of the GC\nreaction with respect to affinity maturation.\nCENTROBLASTS DIFFERENTIATE INTO CENTROCYTES\nAFTERONE GENERATION\nAfter having introduced the basic model for\none centroblast generation and having shown\nA MODEL FOR GC KINETICS 161that it reproduces, reasonably well, kinetic data\non the primed primary immune response, we\nnow introduce a multi-generation model and\nshow by comparison with experimental data that\na one-generation model agrees best with experi-\nmental data.

It is sufficient to numerically solve the\nproblem for the one- and two-generation case in\norder to see why only the one-generation model\nis consistent with experimental data. While in\nthis model centrocytes greatly outnumber cen-\ntroblasts during the main part of the reaction\n[Fig. 3(a)] as observed by MacLennan and co-\nworkers (MacLennan et al., 1990), this is not the\ncase in the two-generation model [Figure 3(b)].\nThe situation is even worse for more generations.\nThus, only the one-generation model is consis-\ntent with experimental observations.15 20 25 30\ndays]\nBblasts               \ncentrocytes           \nGC efflux cells       \ntotal B cells         \nAg\/FDC [particle\/cell]\n15 20 25 30\ndays]\nBblasts               \ncentrocytes           \nGC efflux cells       \ntotal B cells         \nAg\/FDC [particle\/cell]\nonse in the one-generation model where selection \u00f0s\u00de and\nermutation terminates at day 16.

MAINI162EXTENSION OF THE BASIC MODELTO INCLUDE\nAFFINITY MATURATION\nFrom the simple model for the GC reaction we\nnow know that centroblasts probably differenti-\nate into centrocytes after one cell division. With\nrespect to the timing of somatic hypermutation\nwe have seen from experiments that a termina-\ntion at about day 16 still allows the model to\nreproduce GC kinetics. We now turn to model-\nling affinity maturation and in this context we\nwill investigate possible benefits of terminating\nsomatic hypermutation well before the end of the\nGC reaction.\nGiven that in the experimental work on\naffinity maturation on which we base this model\nonly low-middle- and high-affinity clones are\ndistinguished (Smith et al., 1997), it is sensible at\nthis stage to restrict ourselves to two species,\nnamely high- and low-affinity clones. We keep\ntrack of the cell populations in these affinity\nclasses by using vectors of size two where the\nfirst argument refers to the number of cells with\nlow affinity of the given cell species and the\nsecond argument to the number of cells with\nhigh affinity. The two components are denoted\nby subscripts. Mutation is modelled by applying\na mutation matrixM and m is therefore replaced\nby mM in eqn (2). We study and compare two\nscenarios, one with somatic hypermutation\ntermination at about day 16 and one without\nsuch termination. During times when somatic\nhypermutation is active we have m \u00bc 0:72 andM\nas given in eqn (34). For all other times we have\nm \u00bc 1 and M is the unit matrix. The constants\ndiffer for high- and low-affinity clones and are\ntherefore written as pairs of numbers where the\nfirst argument refers to the constant for low-\naffinity clones and the second argument to the\nconstant for high-affinity clones.

While the\nRHS is identical to the case for the one-\ngeneration model, the LHS of inequality (33)\nnow includes the sum of all centroblast popula-\ntions.\nIt is not difficult to show that if inequality (29)\nis satisfied there is a net shift of the mutation\nmatrix M to high affinity (i.e. M224M11) if the\npopulation of low-affinity centroblasts is larger\nthan the population of high-affinity centroblasts\nA MODEL FOR GC KINETICS 165by more than M12=M21: Multiplication of the\nmutation matrix with itself, however, does not\nchange the ratio Mn12=M\nn\n21 as can be seen from\nthe explicit calculation of Mn with n \u00bc 2:\nM2 \u00bc\nM211 \u00feM12M21 M12\u00f0M11 \u00feM22\u00de\nM21\u00f0M11 \u00feM22\u00de M222 \u00feM12M21\n !\n:\nFrom this we see that the ratio between\nworsening and improving mutations is constant\nif the matrix is multiplied by itself. This implies\nthat if the population of low-affinity clones is\nlarger than the population of high-affinity clones\nby more than M12=M21; then we have a\nnet increase in the high-affinity population\nupon application of this matrix. If, however,\nthe proportion of high-affinity clones is higher,\nthen this matrix lowers this proportion. In\nthe limit we can therefore only attain the ratio\nM12=M21 by consecutive application of\nthis matrix.

MAINI166order to be able to further expand the high-\naffinity clones without the risk of losing them\nbecause of worsening mutations. It is also clear\nthat somatic hypermutation must not terminate\nbefore high-affinity clones have evolved. Given\nthat high-affinity clones have about nine muta-\ntions (Siekevitz et al., 1987; Wedemayer et al.,\n1997), and assuming that one way through the\ncycle takes about a day, we need about 9 days of\nsomatic hypermutation. Given that not every\nmutation is beneficial the 12 days allowed for\nsomatic hypermutation to take place seems to be\nreasonable.\nNUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE FULLMODEL\nAfter having gained insights concerning the\nnumber of centroblast generations, the optimal\ntime span of somatic hypermutation, the optimal\nchoice of the selection factor and the recycling\nprobability, the final step to take is to solve\nnumerically the full model of the GC reaction\nincluding affinity maturation. Modelling affinity\nmaturation allows us to finally include the\ncompetition between centrocytes and emerging\nhigh-affinity antibodies as a driving force of\naffinity maturation. The resulting model is\nrobust against variations in the initial antigen\namount over several orders of magnitude and\nagainst variations in the proportion of beneficial\nmutations.\nFirst, biologically reasonable values need to be\ndeduced for all parameters. For most rates the\nrange can be justified while the correct value\nremains elusive and would require further\nexperiments. However, the quality of the esti-\nmates should be sufficient for the predictions\nmade to be of biological interest. In order to find\nthe correct entries for M we use calculations by\nothers (Shannon & Mehr, 1999) that estimate\n53% of all mutations to be silent and 28% to be\nlethal. Therefore, from the surviving 72%, 74%\nhave not changed affinity while 26% have. We\ncannot expect that more than 10% of all\nmutations which change the affinity (or about\n2% of all mutations) are beneficial. Manser even\nassumes that only 0.1% of all mutations are\nbeneficial (Manser, 1990), a figure which may,\nhowever, be quite pessimistic. Assuming that\n10% of all changing mutations are beneficial weobtain as mutation matrix\nM \u00bc\n0:948 0:468\n0:052 0:532\n !\n\u00f034\u00de\nwhich is derived as follows. If 10% of\nall changing mutations were beneficial, 2:6%\nof all low-affinity clones would be promoted to\nhigh affinity in every round of mutation. We\ntherefore have M21 \u00bc 0:1\b 0:26\b 2 \u00bc 0:052\nwhere the factor 2 comes in since the sum over\nall entries of M is 2. The remaining part of the\nlow-affinity clones remains of low-affinity and\nwe therefore find M11 \u00bc 1\u0004 0:052 \u00bc 0:948: Gi-\nven that we assume that 26% of all mutations\nchange the affinity \u00f026\u0004 2:6\u00de% \u00bc 23:4% must\nreduce the affinity so that M12 \u00bc 0:234\b 2 \u00bc\n0:468: The remaining high-affinity clones remain\nof high-affinity and we find for the last matrix\nentry M22 \u00bc 1\u0004 0:468 \u00bc 0:532:\nGiven that the division rate is r \u00bc 24\n6:5 day\n\u00041\nand we apply the mutation matrix continuously\nin every time step, we need to take M to the\npower \u00bd24 day\u00041=6:5\u0007 \b dt with dt \u00bc 0:1 being\nour numerical finite time difference.

The GC reaction could attain\nA MODEL FOR GC KINETICS 167such stability by a feedback mechanism\nsuch that in case of a high availability of antigen\nthe total cell number would be reduced.\nA possible candidate for such a feedback\nmechanism is antigen masking by high-affinity\nantibodies \u00f0Ab\u00de: On the other hand, antibodies\nwith an affinity marginally above average may\nstill be out-competed by centrocytes. The emer-\ngence of high-affinity antibodies in the serum has\nbeen determined experimentally for a true\nprimary immune response (Smith et al., 1994;\n1997). The emergence of antibodies follows a\nsaturation law and the largest increase in anti-\nbody concentration was found between day 7\n(when high-affinity antibodies can first be found)\nand day 14. A simplistic way of modelling the\nkinetics of high-affinity antibody emergence is\ngiven by\ndAb\ndt\n\u00bc kAFC2 \u0004 konAgAb\nwith k \u00bc 108\nantibody\nday\b cell\n;\nkon \u00bc 5\b 10\u000413 day\n\u00041particle\u00041 \u00f036\u00de\nwhich is derived as follows. Given that\nhigh-affinity antibodies are produced by high-\naffinity plasma cells \u00f0AFC2\u00de it is sensible to\nassume that the increase in antibody concentra-\ntion is proportional to the size of this\ncell population (first summand in eqn (36))\nwhile the decrease is proportional to anti-\nbody:antigen complex formation (second sum-\nmand in eqn (36)).

A maximal\nvalue for k; the production rate of high-affinity\nantibodies that are retained within the GC,\ncannot be expected to be smaller than 1011\nantibodies per cell per day. However, it is\nreasonable to assume that the major part of\nall antibodies produced is either already\nproduced outside of GCs or is at least not\nretained within the GC. Given that we con-\nsider high-affinity interactions, antibody:antigen\nbinding is considered to be irreversible on thetime-scale considered and koff is set to be zero.\nNatural decay of antibody by catabolizing\nprocesses as well as by other parts of the\nimmune response such as the innate are\nneglected. The stoichiometry of the antigen:anti-\nbody complex depends on the antigen. Given\nthat there is no data available on the amount of\nantibody found in GCs it is, however, not\nsensible to worry about stoichiometries at this\nstage. With this model we can only investigate\nwhether antigen masking by antibody could\ndrive affinity maturation efficientlyFfurther\nexperiments are then needed to elucidate this\npoint.\nThe availability of free, unbound antigen will\ndecrease due to extraction as discussed before\nand due to antigen masking and we therefore\nhave\ndAg\ndt\n\u00bc \u0004\u00f0ukC \u00fe uCs\u00f01\u0004 k\u00de\u00deAg \u0004 konAgAb\nwith u \u00bc 10\u00044\nparticle\ncell\b day\n:\n\u00f037\u00de\nThe on-rate kon \u00bc 5\b 10\u000413 day\n\u00041particle\u00041\nC3:5\b 106 M\u00041 s\u00041 is used as before. u; the\nextraction rate of antigen by centrocytes, is again\nchosen such that only about half of the antigen\nvanishes from the germinal centre.

Z accounts for the negative feedback of\nantigen:antibody complexes on B cell signalling\nwhich is here assumed to cause more recycling\nand less B cell differentiation to plasma and\nmemory cells.\nIn the scenario where termination of somatic\nhypermutation is included, it occurs simulta-\nneously with increased selection stringency. Both\nprocesses may therefore be regulated by the same\nmechanism and we assume that somatic hyper-\nmutation terminates when zo1: A more realistic\ncase would be a continuous decrease of somatic\nhypermutation with decreasing z:\nThe centrocytes which do not recycle can\neither differentiate into memory or antibody-\nproducing plasma cells (also called antibody-\nforming cells (AFCs)). It has been observed that\nearly selected centrocytes preferentially leave the\nGC reaction and differentiate into antibody-\nforming cells, many of which migrate to the bone\nmarrow where they persist for several weeks\nand secrete antibodies (Smith et al., 1997). The\nproportion of high-affinity clones among AFCs\nlocated in the spleen during the measurements\nhas been determined explicitly in the experiments\nand we will use these data to validate the model.\nThere is inconclusive data concerning memory\ncells \u00f0M\u00de: While from histological investigations\nit was claimed that memory cells can first be\nfound between days 3 and 4 (MacLennan, pers.\ncomm., 2001), investigations of the antibody\nrepertoire support the concept that memory cells\ndevelop late during the response. Theoretical\nanalysis shows that the affinity of the memory\ncell pool is higher, the later memory cell\nformation starts (Meyer-Hermann et al., 2001)\nalthough at least in the model presented here thedifference caused by a late start is not very high.\nIn vitro experiments have shown that there may\nexist a feedback loop which inhibits plasma cell\nformation once there is a high titre of IgG\nantibodies (Tarlinton & Smith, 2001). In the true\nprimary immune response they can be detected\nin the serum at day 7 (Smith et al., 1994; 1997).\nTaken together the dynamics of plasma and\nmemory cells can be modelled by\ndAFC\ndt\n\u00bc yr\u00f01\u0004 pr\u00deCs; \u00f040\u00de\ndM\ndt\n\u00bc \u00f01\u0004 y\u00der\u00f01\u0004 pr\u00deCs; \u00f041\u00de\nwhere y \u00bc 0:3\u00f0Ag=\nP\ni Ci\u00de \u00f0Ag=\u00f0Ag \u00fe KAgAb\u00de\u00de is\nthe product of the ratio of free antigen to\ncentrocytes and the fraction of free antigen, and\nmodels the inhibition of AFC formation by less\navailability of free antigen and by the emergence\nof IgG:antigen complexes.\nFigures 6 and 7 show numerical simulation\nresults for the cases without termination of\nsomatic hypermutation or with termination,\nrespectively. In both cases, the overall kinetics\nbehave as before and as described in the\nliterature (Liu et al., 1991). Given that we are\nstill considering a one-generation model, cen-\ntrocytes still outnumber centroblasts as observed\nby MacLennan and co-workers (MacLennan\net al., 1990). As found in experiments (Tew &\nMandels, 1979), the total amount of antigen is\nonly halved during the immune response (curve\nfor Ag:Ab complexes in Figs 6 and 7), while\nthe amount of free antigen is reduced to zero due\nto masking by soluble high-affinity antibodies\nwhich are produced by plasma cells. This\nmasking drives the competition in the germinal\ncentres and leads to affinity maturation (Figs. 6\nand 7 middle panel) as observed in experiments\n(Smith et al., 1997). The total amount of free\nantibody in the GCs obtained in this simulation\ncorresponds to a concentration of about 1 M\nwhich is reasonable since we have not considered\nthe fact that most of the antibodies will be\nproduced outside the GC or diffuse out, and\nin experiments millimolar concentrations of\nantibody are already sufficient to block binding.\nThe GC reaction and the affinity maturation in\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n5000\n10000\n(a) t[days]\nce\nll \nnu\nm\nbe\nr\/G\nC B blasts                   \ncentrocytes                \nGCR efflux cells           \ntotal B cells              \nfree Ag\/FDC [particle\/cell]\n5*10\u22129 Antibody         \nAg:Ab complexes            \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n(b) t[days]\npr\nop\nor\ntio\nn \nof\n h\nig\nh \na\nffi\nni\nty\n c\nel\nls\nexperimental results       \nmodel results[Aff(C+Cs+M)]\nmodel results[Aff(C+Cs)]  \n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n0\n0.5\nt[days](c)\ns1    \ns2    \npr1   \npr2   \n1.0\n\u03b8\nFig. 6.

This is in good agreement with the\nobservation that the amount of deposited anti-\ngen varies (MacLennan, pers. comm., 2001) and\nexperiments in which the antigen amount was\nstrongly increased but the reaction was found to\nbe normal (Vora et al., 1997). Also the propor-\ntion of beneficial mutations can be varied over a\nwide range without affecting the GC reaction or\naffinity maturation substantially. This robust-\nness is very important since the proportion of\nbeneficial mutations will strongly depend on the\nantigen encountered. Also in favour of both\nmodels is the proportion of high-affinity AFCs\nat day 14. Although nothing was specificallyundertaken to influence this number, the pro-\nportion given in the literature (56%) (Smith\net al., 1997) is reproduced well by the model\n(65.5%). The antibody level increases exponen-\ntially in this model while a saturation curve was\nobtained in the experiments (Smith et al., 1997).\nThe reason for this is that in this model no\nfurther antibody decreasing processes such as\nnatural decay and the immune response against\nthe invader are considered.\nThe only major difference between the simula-\ntions with and without termination of somatic\nhypermutation is the extent of affinity matura-\ntion.

GC kinetics and affinity maturation of the primed primary immune response if somatic hypermutation\nterminates before the end of the GC reaction. (a) GC kinetics of the primed primary immune response in the one-generation\nmodel. The dynamics of all cell populations behave as described before. (b) Affinity maturation during the primed primary\nimmune response if somatic hypermutation terminates before the end of the GC reaction. The solid line represents\nexperimental results for a true primary immune response (Smith et al., 1997) which starts later than the primed primary\nimmune response. The model results for the affinity increase in centrocyte (c), selected centrocyte \u00f0Cs\u00de and memory cell \u00f0M\u00de\npopulation together (broken line) are close to those observed experimentally except for the final affinity increase after day\n16. Until about day 16 the affinity increase is largely due to an affinity increase in the memory population. After the\ntermination of somatic hypermutation the average affinity increases again substantially due to an affinity increase in\nthe centrocyte population \u00f0C \u00fe Cs\u00de which is represented by the dotted line. Termination of somatic hypermutation before\nthe end of the GC reaction is therefore beneficial for affinity maturation and would be necessary to reproduce experimental\ndata if a lower proportion of improving mutations had been chosen. The earlier onset of affinity maturation seen in the\nmodel results from the nature of the primed primary immune response.

This is a further\npoint in favour of termination of somatic\nhypermutation at about day 16 as has been\nsuggested before by several experimentalists\n(Berek & Milstein, 1988; Jacob et al., 1993).\nOne further way to check the model is to impair\nrecycling \u00f0pr \u00bc 0\u00de: As has been shown experi-\nmentally (de Vinuesa et al., 2000) this leads to a\nbreak-down of the GC reaction (see Fig. 8).\nThe last step is to build a multi-bin model.\nHowever, given that neither entries for the much\nmore complex mutation matrix nor values forthe different entries of s or pr are known, it is\nsensible to wait for more experimental data to be\navailable before undertaking a detailed model-\nling approach.\nDiscussion\nKINETICASPECTS\n(a) Regulation of centroblast to centrocyte\ndifferentiation: No experiments have been car-\nried out to address the regulation mechanism\nfor the differentiation of centroblasts into\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10000\nt[days]\nce\nll \nnu\nm\nbe\nr\/G\nC\nB blasts     \ncentrocytes  \ntotal B cells\nFig. 8.

From the kinetic data available we\ncan rule out both a cell-density-dependent and a\ntime-dependent mechanism. From the observa-\ntion of MacLennan and co-workers (MacLen-\nnan et al., 1990) that centrocytes greatly\noutnumber centroblasts during the main part\nof the GC reaction it also follows that centro-\nblasts differentiate into centrocytes after one cell\ndivision since otherwise both cell populations are\neither of the same size or centroblasts even\noutnumber centrocytes (see Fig. 7). This result\nimplies a much simpler mechanism for conver-\nsion than the model of Kesmir and de Boer\n(1999) where it was proposed that centroblasts\ndo not differentiate before having gone through\nat least four divisions, raising the question as to\nhow centroblasts sense through how many\ngenerations they have already gone and whether\nsomatic hypermutation acts on each generation.\n(b) Start of memory cell formation: Recently, a\nmodel has been proposed in which a non-output\nphase is shown to be beneficial for affinity\nmaturation (Meyer-Hermann et al., 2001). This\nleaves the question as to how the initiation ofmemory cell formation is regulated. If IgG at\nleast partially inhibits AFC formation as mea-\nsured in vitro (Ridderstad & Tarlinton, 1998;\nTarlinton & Smith, 2000), memory cell forma-\ntion may increase with time as was assumed in\nthis model. Such a regulation would allow the\nbody to produce antibodies as a first defence\nagainst rapidly dividing pathogens until the titre\nof high-affinity IgG antibodies is sufficiently\nhigh and a feedback inhibition of AFC forma-\ntion leads to a switch to more memory cell\nformation. AFCs and memory cells are also\nfound in the bone marrow and other places\nin the body. It is, however, unknown which\nproportion emigrates and whether and how\noften cells divide before leaving the GC. Because\nof this lack of data emigration was not\nincorporated in the model.\nThere is a long-running debate on whether or\nnot there is a further selection step for cells to\neither enter the memory or plasma cell pool\n(Smith et al., 1997). There are certainly signals\nwhich bias selected centrocytes to differentiate in\neither direction (Liu et al., 1997) but given that\nD. IBER AND P. K. MAINI172the model presented here reproduces the experi-\nmental proportions of high-affinity clones with-\nout considering such a further selection step,\nproperties other than affinity may be important\nfor differentiation in either direction.\nTHE EFFICIENCYOFAFFINITY MATURATION\n(a) The role of selection and recycling: The\nprocess of the immune response would be most\nefficient if somatic hypermutation worked on a\nsmall number of centroblast generations \u00f0no10\u00de\nand if the initial and recycling centroblast\npopulation had a very small proportion of\nhigh-affinity clones. This has indeed been shown\nfor the initial centroblast population which was\nfound to consist of 3% high-affinity clones\n(Smith et al., 1997). In order to keep the\nproportion of high-affinity centroblasts low, the\nrecycling probability for high-affinity centro-\nblasts needs to be much smaller than for low-\naffinity clones. Such a regime would also be\ncompatible with inequality (27) as discussed\nabove. This is a new insight into the importance\nof this parameter for affinity maturation and\nraises the question of how high-affinity clones\ncould be generated from low-affinity clones if\nclones of improved affinity hardly recycle and\nhigh-affinity clones cannot be generated from\nlow-affinity clones in one round. This conceptual\nproblem arises because of the simplicity of our\nmodel which only considers two different affi-\nnities so that a shift from low- to high-affinity is\npossible in this model.\nAt this stage it is therefore beneficial to\nconsider an advanced model with 10 bins.\nThe number 10 is sensible since experimentalists\nfind that high-affinity B cells differ in their\nantibody coding genes by about eight mutations\nfrom germline genes. Assuming that every one\nof these mutations changes the affinity of the\nantibody, it is sensible to use eight bins for\nimproved affinity, one for the starting affinity\nand one for reduced\/no affinity. While cells\nbelow the starting bin undergo apoptosis when\ntrying to interact with antigen, cells well above\nthe starting bin are selected into the plasma\ncell pool or into the memory cell pool. The cells\nin the bins in between mostly recycle, some of\nthem may also enter the memory pool. Thethreshold above which cells definitely leave\nthe GC as memory or plasma cells can be\nassumed to increase during the germinal centre\nreaction. This is in agreement with the analysis\nof the two-bin model: once most of the popula-\ntion has gone, say from bin 2 to bin 3, bin 2\nacts as the low-affinity bin in our model\nand is assigned the recycling probability for\nlow-affinity cells instead of that of high-affinity\ncells. Therefore, the recycling probability\nchanges with time for the different bins and\nfinally even clones of relatively high-affinity\nrecycle and are expanded. In this model,\nhigh-affinity clones preferentially leave the\nGC reaction at the beginning. This is\nalso intuitively understandable since at the\nbeginning a high-affinity clone, which was\ngenerated by chance, would be lost with high\nprobability once it goes through mutation again\nsince most of the mutations worsen the\nantibody. Additionally, the body needs early\nhigh-affinity clones in order to hold the invader\nin check. Early emigration is therefore beneficial\nfor the efficiency of affinity maturation and\nfor the early immune response. Once, however,\nmany clones have reached the next affinity bin\nand mutation acts on a wide platform, mutations\nare beneficial since they will not lead to a\ncomplete elimination of the already gained\nbeneficial mutations but there is a good chance\nthat affinity is even enhanced.\nThe early emigration of high-affinity clones\nhas been described previously (Radmacher et al.,\n1998; Smith et al., 1997) but was understood to\nbe due to a stochasticity in the selection and was\nviewed as a failure of the system (Radmacher\net al., 1998). The model presented here suggests\nthat the early emigration is a deterministic\nprocess and is beneficial for affinity maturation\nand for the defence of the organism against the\ninvader since the early emigrants produce anti-\nbodies which support the organism\u2019s first de-\nfence. This finding is also in good agreement\nwith another experimental result where a trans-\ngene which coded for a high-affinity antibody\nwas inserted into the genome of an animal (Vora\n& Manser, 1995). The animal nevertheless\nproduced a similar memory cell repertoire\nas the control animals without the transgene.\nThis favours the notion of deterministic early\nA MODEL FOR GC KINETICS 173emigration of high-affinity clones which there-\nfore do not dominate the response. In the later\nresponse animals without the transgene have\nobtained antibodies of comparable affinity by\nmutation while the antibody encoded by the\ntransgene can accumulate worsening mutations.\nThe model also explains the results of\nHannum and co-workers (Hannum et al., 2000)\nwhich show that the germinal centre reaction is\nmore or less normal even if the animals cannot\ndeposit antigen on FDCs due to the lack of\nsoluble antibodies. Their data show that the GC\ncell numbers are even higher than in the control\nanimals while the activation of centrocytes is\nreduced. Due to less activation, presumably\nmore cells recycle and the GC reaction is\ntherefore stable. The activation may be lower\nsince antigen cannot be displayed professionally\non FDCs but needs to be recognized in other\n(maybe even in soluble) form which elicits lower\nresponse (Batista et al., 2001).\nThe selection factor needs to be chosen in the\nopposite way to the recycling rate and is high for\nhigh-affinity clones and low for low-affinity\nclones. This is also intuitively understandable.\nWith time competition for antigen increases\nbecause extraction of antigen by centrocytes\nlowers the antigen density. Therefore, the selec-\ntion proportion of low affinity clones decreases\nwith time.\n(b) The role of termination of somatic hyper-\nmutation: The analysis of this model shows that\ntermination of somatic hypermutation before the\nend of the germinal centre reaction is beneficial\nfor affinity maturation since it allows the\nexpansion of high-affinity clones without the\nhazard of losing the clone due to worsening\nmutations. The signal for a switch-off of somatic\nhypermutation may be less activation due to less\navailability of free antigen since this would also\nprovide a mechanism for an increase in the\nselection stringency at the same time. The\ncorrelation may be due to a connection between\nactivating signals during centrocyte selection and\nsignals for continuation of somatic hypermuta-\ntion after centrocytes have recycled. The signal\nmay also be received directly by centroblasts\nwhich have been shown recently to express\nsurface immunoglobulin in the late stages of\nthe GC (Camacho et al., 1998). During thatstage the dark and light zones can no longer be\nseen and the FDC network extends through the\nwhole germinal centre such that centroblasts can\ndirectly interact with FDCs. With the beginning\nof the second week of the response, these FDCs\nhave further been shown to express CD23, also\nknown as FceRII (Camacho et al., 1998). CD23\nhas been shown to bind to CD21, which\nmodulates signalling through BCR. Time dy-\nnamic expression of various such surface mole-\ncules may regulate somatic hypermutation\ntermination.\nIn total, we conclude that antigen masking by\nevolving antibody is an effective way by which\naffinity maturation may be driven. The postu-\nlated feedback effect on AFC formation may\nfurther regulate the extent to which B cells either\nleave the GC or recycle. Understanding the\nmechanism and regulation of recycling may be\nkey to understanding affinity maturation as from\nthis model the extent to which B cells leave or\nrecycle has a very strong impact on affinity\nmaturation. This is also sensible from a biolo-\ngical point of view since selection is mainly\nmeant to have a protective function against\nthe emergence of self-reactive clones. It is not\nsensible to eliminate even weak binders which\ncan be used as plasma cells as a first defence\nagainst the invader. Furthermore, the model\nstrongly supports the concept of an early\ntermination of somatic hypermutation at about\nday 16 since without such a termination, affinity\nmaturation would be less efficient as termination\nof somatic hypermutation allows the expansion\nof the high-affinity B cell population without the\nhazard of worsening mutations.\nThis model made use of several black boxes in\nwhich less well characterized steps were included.\nBefore refining the model, predictions made by\nthe model must be tested experimentally, and\nmore data obtained on the dependence of B cell\nselection on BCR:antigen affinity and antigen\ndensity. Furthermore, it would be interesting to\nhave data on the impact of antigen masking by\nantibody on affinity maturation and on fate\ndetermination by the quality of BCR:antigen\nand B cell:T cell interaction. Finally, it would\nbe helpful if the sizes of the different B cell\npopulations (centroblasts, centrocytes, memory\ncells, plasma cells) were known in detail.\nD. IBER AND P. K.
