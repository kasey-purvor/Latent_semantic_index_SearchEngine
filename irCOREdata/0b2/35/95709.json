The first concerns the \nepistemological and ethical break that divides psychoanalysis\u2019 clinical praxis from its role as a means of \nqualitative or interview methodology. A second deals with the status of psychoanalytic discourse as a \ntouchstone of authority, as a \u2018master\u2019s discourse\u2019. Debating such problems opens up two possible  \nroutes of methodological enquiry: the potential of using psychoanalysis, following Parker (2008), as a \nmeans of subverting effects of mastery, individuality and truth, and the idea of focusing on libidinal \neconomy rather than on individual subjects when it comes to combining textual and psychoanalytic \nforms of analysis. The paper closes by discussing the notion of a trans-individual unconscious, \nproposing that psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies might find some common ground with \nreference to the Lacanian idea of the unconscious as the subjective locus of the Other. \n \nKeywords: libidinal economy; trans-individual unconscious; Other  \n \n 1\nArticulating psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies: Limitations and possibilities  \nDerek Hook \n \nIntroduction \n \nFrosh and Baraitser identify at least three prospective impasses in their astute observations regarding \nthe hope of articulating psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies. The first of these concerns the \nepistemological and ethical break that divides psychoanalysis\u2019 clinical praxis from its role as a means of \nqualitative or interview methodology. A second point of conflict concerns the status of psychoanalytic \ndiscourse as a touchstone of authority and knowledge, as - ironically enough for a theory of the \nsubversion of rationality - a mode of certainty, a \u2018master\u2019s discourse\u2019. The discussion of such problems \nopens up two possible routes of methodological enquiry: the potential of using psychoanalysis, \nfollowing Parker (2008), to subvert effects of mastery, individuality and truth, and the idea of focusing \non libidinal economy rather than on individual subjects when it comes to combining textual and \npsychoanalytic forms of analysis. A third impasse involves discussion over a workable notion of the \nunconscious that may viably link psychosocial and psychoanalytic studies. I will begin with the first of \nthese themes \u2013 the disjunction between the clinic and the realm of qualitative research - because it \nrepresents an issue where I am in complete agreement with Frosh and Baraitser.  \n \nOverstretching the clinic \n \nFrosh and Baraitser do well to point out the difficulties inherent in the attempt to replicate the clinical \ntechnology of psychoanalysis in non-clinical environments. There is no doubt that psychoanalysis \nbrings a distinctive conceptual frame and a powerful distancing procedure - indeed, a potentially \nsubversive reading and listening \u2018methodology\u2019 - to the work of critique. One need remain vigilant, \nhowever, toward the epistemological and ethical disjunction that accompanies attempts to apply \n 2\npsychoanalysis\u2019 clinical forms beyond the confines of the clinic. The case of ostensibly \u2018expert\u2019 \npsychoanalytic interpretations made of others (colleagues, research participants, etc.), from the position \nof implicit mastery (as in the case of published commentary), makes for a case in point. \nI would argue that not even the position of analyst within the clinical frame automatically \nwarrants a complete interpretative latitude. We know that for Freud, despite the dazzling interpretative \ndisplays in his written work, a dream interpretation can only be definitive, \u2018authorized\u2019, by the dreamers \nthemselves. The Lacanian procedure of enigmatic, oracular interpretative interventions \u2013 which often \ntake the form of question-posing performative gestures rather than actual comments \u2013 likewise flies in \nthe face of a clinician\u2019s prerogative to offer definitive interpretations. If one accepts that sense-making \nand understanding often function - much like the apparent illuminations of interpretation itself - as \nmeans of defence, as easy forms of closure or resolution, then we appreciate how such processes undo \nanalytical work which should precisely take us further and further into unknowing.  \nWe might admit that psychoanalytic interpretation remains always poised on the verge of wild \nanalysis. This, it would seem, is the inherent epistemic risk posed by a discipline that hopes to trace the \nunconscious in its most unlikely and absurd manifestations. If this is indeed the case, then the factors of \nsupervision, clinical technique, the provision of an appropriate ethical code, and the contextualization of \na detailed and ongoing (week-by-week, year-by-year) life-history \u2013 that is, precisely those factors \nwhich in part define the clinic \u2013 are all of absolute necessity. It is thus difficult to see how one can \njustifiably extend clinical psychoanalytic warrants (such as diagnosis and interpretation of individuals) \nbeyond the parameters of the clinic. \n \nLibidinal economy  \n \nThe non-generalizability of psychoanalytic clinical intervention beyond the clinic does not suggest that \nwe have reached a dead-end with regard to how psychoanalytic procedures might be linked to textual \nanalytic work. To the contrary, I believe there are at least two under-explored strategies deserving of \n 3\nfurther attention in this respect. The first concerns the move, evident in instances of postcolonial \ncriticism, to employ the vocabulary of psychoanalytic description to apprehend certain systematic \npatterns and operations occurring within a given discursive formation. Rather than settling on individual \nsubjects and their particular diagnostics or dynamics, such an analytic targets the libidinal economy of a \ngiven discourse. Such an approach, referring back to Freud\u2019s (1921) libidinal economy of the mass in \nGroup Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, remains irreducibly social in its focus. Libidinal \neconomy is a fundamental vector of group identification: the push-pull cohesion of its ego-ideal and \nideal-ego dynamics is precisely what for Freud proved constitutive of social bonds. It would seem in \nthis respect that the proposed articulation between psychoanalysis and discourse\/textual analysis (or \npsychosocial studies more generally) might profit more from the approach of Freud\u2019s group psychology \nthan from his clinical procedures.  \nThe analysis of the libidinal economy underlying specific discursive formations would move us \naway from the attempt to grasp the unconscious of any individual subject. It proposes a non-reductive \nanalytical strategy, asserting that discourses themselves maintain the coherence, the repetitiveness - \nindeed, the cycles of jouissance - that mark certain well-established patterns of libidinal functioning, a \nstrategy which does not attempt to fix such discursive patterns as merely the outcome of intra-psychic \nprocesses, of individual psychopathology. The colonial stereotype, for Bhabha (2004), for example, is \nseen to accord, in all its insistence, its defensiveness and precariousness, with the libidinal economy of \nfetishism. Similarly, in Fanon (1967) we find an argument according to which the ambivalent \nvacillations of racist discourse might be usefully analyzed along the lines of the libidinal economy of \nphobia. Coetzee (1991), furthermore, has examined how facets of apartheid ideology \u2013 ideology at the \nlevel of community and nation - might productively be understood as exemplifying the libidinal \npatterns of obsessionality, along with its associated strategies of fantasy and metonymic displacement, \nenabling thus an understanding of the longevity of apartheid\u2019s \u2018malaise of reason\u2019.  \nIt is not difficult to see how certain psychoanalytic concepts usefully inform such an approach. \nThe assumption here is, to give an example, that the effective functioning of any discursive formation \n 4\nnecessarily entails particular master-signifiers (or \u2018empty signifiers\u2019 to use Laclau\u2019s (1996) term), that \nis, nodal-points in the discourse which can never be definitely fixed or exhausted. These nodal points \nremain somehow open, but they anchor meaning (as in the case of appeals to \u2018Science\u2019, \n\u2018psychoanalysis\u2019, \u2018Truth\u2019 etc.) and organize the ideological field. In much the same vein, one might \nattempt to identify certain sublime or privileged objects, fantasmatic object-causes of desire, points \naround which a discourse pivots. I have in mind here the role of certain precious (objet petit a) objects, \nwhich contain a je ne sais quoi quality, something \u2018in them more than themselves\u2019, and hence take on a \ndisproportionate libidinal status by virtue of the degree of investment of a given community. Similarly, \none might identify the defensive procedures of a discourse, questioning how it operates a particular \nmodality of negation following on from the Freudian intuition that different forms of negation can be \nlinked to distinctive libidinal patterns: repression in the case of neurosis, disavowal in the case of \nperversion, foreclosure in the case of psychosis. Paul Gilroy\u2019s (2004) analysis of contemporary \nBritishness, for example, reveals a dynamics of selective aggrandizement and amnesia, an awkward \njuxtaposition of a repressed colonial past existing alongside imperatives to rejuvenate a vision of British \ngreatness. The resulting cultural conjunction, he concludes, is one that exhibits all the patterns of \nneurotic blockage, repetition and ambivalence, particularly in view of its attempted adjustment to the \nchallenges of multicultural society. \n Apprehending the libidinal economy of given discourses might enable us to answer questions \nalong the lines of why certain signifiers come to be locked into patterns of repetition; why some are \nparticularly historically-persistent, \u2018sticky\u2019, difficult to shake; why others are so volatile and anxious, \nshort-circuiting reason to attain more immediately affective responses. It may likewise assist us in \nunderstanding why still other signifiers are so quickly dissipated, failing to gain the investment, the \n\u2018volume\u2019, the affective hegemony of those more effectively enjoyed by a given community. \n \nPsychoanalytic procedure against psychoanalysis  \n \n 5\nA second possibility regarding the use of psychoanalytic methodology for qualitative research can be \nread out of Parker\u2019s (2008) Lacanian application of psychoanalysis against psychoanalysis, that is, his \nelaboration of Lacan\u2019s (2007) injunctions against the multiple lures of mastery, individuality and truth \nwhich stem from treating psychoanalysis as an idealized from of knowledge. There are moments in \nsuch an application of psychoanalysis, in the investigation of particular discursive structures (of the \nmaster, the university, the hysteric, the analytic), where an ostensibly Lacanian engagement feels \nFoucauldian, certainly so inasmuch as it pertains to particular historical situations, locates specific \nstructural speaking-positions of dominance and proves able to pin-point both what is effectively \nproduced and barred by such discursive structures or social ties (Lacan, 2007; \u017di\u017eek, 2004). \n Parker, like Frosh and Baraitser, is alive to the particular discursive capital that comes with \nspeaking from the position of psychoanalytic mastery. This is a longstanding issue: how psychoanalysis \nworks within culture as a \u2018trump discourse\u2019 able to authorize particular discursive warrants \n(interpretation, the prerogative to discern the unconscious dimension of everyday explanations), \nexclusions (merely rational forms of knowledge as superficial) and truth-effects (its constructions of the \ndeep truths of human subjectivity). Who in this respect can forget Foucault\u2019s (1977) analysis of the psy-\ndisciplines as possessed of an implicit moral force, and of psychoanalysis in particular (1978) as, in \nFrosh and Baraitser\u2019s words, \u201can expert system that has access to [an] inner world and knows what it is \nlike, and posits it as something that exists in and of itself\u201d? In response to this, one can only evoke \nParker\u2019s (2008) Lacanian insistence that psychoanalytic procedures should be applied precisely against \nthe discursive effects of truth, mastery, individuality, that such subversive reading strategies be opposed \nto the formation and\/or productions of any master\u2019s discourse, even if that discourse is psychoanalysis \nitself. \n Frosh and Baraitser make a parallel move to Parker\u2019s in calling upon reflexivity as a means of \ndestabilizing such hegemonic formations within the aspirant \u2018trans-disciplinarity\u2019 of psychosocial \nstudies. There is a faint equivocation here: reflexivity is first evoked as a means of subversion, as a \nsafeguard of criticality; as their argument progresses, however, the claim to reflexivity is itself \n 6\nscrutinized as an inadequate mark of critical distance. With the latter argument I can only agree: \ninasmuch as reflexivity involves a type of ego-judgement on its own productions, it cannot but be part \nof the problem, a means of insulating the m\u00e9connaissance of ego-misrecognition within a closed-\ncircuit. Neither the perspective I have on my own perspective, nor my co-researcher\u2019s input on my own \ninput, entails an adequate degree of otherness; for reflexivity to work, a far more radical break, a more \nforceful discontinuity needs to be introduced. I agree with Frosh and Baraitser that psychoanalysis \nprecisely as a procedure for not understanding, as means of pinpointing what is Other in my own \ncommonplace constructions, holds some promise here. Psychoanalysis however is not our only answer: \nfor Foucault such a generation of discontinuity typically takes the genealogical form of neglected \nhistories; for cultural and social theory this often takes the form of an unceasing exploration of different \ntheoretical languages, registers of engagement, modes of critique. \n \n \nThe trans-individual unconscious \n \nThis discussion of disjunction, discontinuity and Otherness leads us into the topic of the unconscious, \nand of what version thereof might suit both psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies. There is an \ninteresting footnote toward the end of one of Slavoj \u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1994) essays on ideology in which he \ninsists that \n \n\u2026the concept of the unconscious is to be conceived in the strictly Freudian sense, as \u2018trans-\nindividual\u2019 \u2013 that is, beyond the ideological opposition of \u2018individual\u2019 and \u2018collective\u2019 \nunconscious: the subject\u2019s unconscious is always grounded in the transferential relationship \ntowards the Other; it is always \u2018external\u2019 with regard to the subject\u2019s monadic existence. \n(1994, p 33) \n \n 7\nChiesa (2007) likewise draws attention to the idea of a trans-individual unconscious which can be \ncollapsed neither into intrasubjectivity (the unconscious as \u201cthe Other within me\u201d) nor into \nintersubjectivity (the unconscious as the Other subject): \n \nThe idea of an \u201cindividual\u201d unconscious \u2013 on which both intra- and intersubjective \naccounts of the unconscious are based makes sense only if the Symbolic [the realm of law, \nlanguage, socio-symbolic functioning] is associated with the Imaginary [the ego-domain of \nidealizing identifications and rivalry]. More importantly, we should emphasize . . . [the] \nunconscious understood as the universal, nonindividuated Other of language \n(which\u2026relies on the linguistic notion of the signifier and the structural laws that govern \nit)\u2026 [W]hat appears \u2013 from an imaginary standpoint \u2013 to be the \u201cindividual\u201d unconscious \nof one given subject cannot be dissociated from language as such. It is in this sense that the \nunconscious is at times said to lie \u201coutside\u201d the subject . . . Lacan\u2019s transindividual \nunconscious . . . [thus] corresponds to a symbolic signifying structure. (Chiesa, 2007, pp \n43-44).  \n \nGrasping such a trans-individual notion of the unconscious is an imperative for the further articulation \nof psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies. It would enable us better to comprehend the failure and \ndisruption, the very lack of self-transparency that proves constitutive of the subject\u2019s emergence as an \nenunciating subject of desire. Any instance of meaning-making, of discourse in operation, brings with it \nsuch impediments, such un-intentions and ambiguities simply by virtue of the fact that they are played \nout in a social field in which statement and enunciation, intended meaning and performative utterance, \nare never one and the same.  \nWithout some acknowledgement of this dimension of rupture and discontinuity, of the \u2018over-\nintention\u2019 of desire at work within language, we would seem necessarily to come up short in our \nattempts to apprehend the functioning of discourse and subjectivity alike. A properly trans-individual \n 8\nnotion of the unconscious is one which in many ways seems commensurate with discursive, or broadly \n\u2018post-structural\u2019 approaches that emphasize the role of social structure and the conditions under which \n\u2018the subject is spoken\u2019. This is unconscious as signifying structure, as operation (as in Freud\u2019s \ndreamwork) of condensation and displacement, an unconscious, put bluntly, evidenced only in the \noperation of the signifier.  \nWithin such a trans-individual conceptualization the unconscious cannot be understood as \nmerely an intra-psychic function; it needs to be apprehended as the outcome of the structural constraints \nwithin which the social act of speaking or making discourse must occur. Such a non-psychological \nperspective on the unconscious targets the functioning of the signifier and the structure of language, \njettisoning notions of depth, internality and hidden primal\/repressed contents in accordance with Frosh \nand Baraitser\u2019s characterization of \u201cnot down and deep\u2026but out and wide\u201d. The unconscious in this \nrespect is, to quote the well-known Lacanian dictum, \u2018the discourse of the Other\u2019, a designation \nemphasizing that the unconscious must always be approached in relation to the trans-subjective social \norder of the big Other. Seshadri-Crooks (2000) makes this argument to great effect: the unconscious \nmust not be grasped as a subterranean space opposed to consciousness, as an inchoate, swirling mass of \nrepressed contents, but rather as the subjective locus of the Other or the symbolic order.  \nSeshandri-Crooks surveys a series of Lacan\u2019s postulates on the unconscious to draw the \nfollowing conclusions: the unconscious is not a primal, archaic function; it is not a set of unorganized \ndrives or repressed contents; it should not be viewed as a collection of an individual\u2019s prohibited \nmemories and desires. She (2000) points to Lacan\u2019s crucial qualification of Freudian doctrine, namely \nthe idea that it is not affects that are repressed, but the ideational representatives of affects, which \nLacan understands within the rubric of the signifier. Hence Lacan\u2019s procedural focus on the \nunconscious as occurring within the actions of speech, the idea that the Lacanian unconscious precisely \nis the processes of signification beyond the control of the speaking subject. This is an external rather \nthan internal unconsciousness, activated in the operations and performances of language, in the \nsubject\u2019s grappling with their place - relative to the Other\u2019s desire - in the symbolic order.  \n 9\nI have tried elsewhere (2008) to develop the transferential dimension emphasized by the above \n\u017di\u017eek quote, to expand upon the fact of an ongoing \u2018fantasmatic transaction\u2019 whereby subjects are \nconstantly preoccupied with the task of fathoming their place in the social order via the \u2018Che vuoi?\u2019 \nformula repetitively posed to the big Other (\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d, \u201cWhat am I to you?\u201d, \u201cWhat must I \nbe?\u201d). \u017di\u017eek has done much to drive home the point that this alienating pattern of questioning - in \nwhich the subject is continually overridden, \u2018determined\u2019 by the operation of the signifier - occurs \neverywhere in the political domain. This is where I will end, by posing an agenda that I take to be of \nprimary importance in thinking psychoanalysis and psychosocial studies together: the need to connect \nquestions of a trans-individual unconscious - and indeed, of libidinal economy - to theoretical, \ndiscursive and empirical analyses of how power and ideology function in the public realm today. \nAbout the author \nDerek Hook is a lecturer in Social Psychology at the London School of Economics and a research \nfellow at the University of the Witwatersrand. The over-arching focus of his research concerns the \nattempt to develop an 'analytics of power' sufficiently able to grapple with the unconscious and \npsychological dimensions of racism and ideological subjectivity. He is the author of Foucault, \nPsychology & the Analytics of Power (Palgrave, 2007), and the editor of Critical Psychology \n(University of Cape Town Press, 2004). He is one of the founding editors of the journal Subjectivity, \nand the coordinator of Psychoanalysis@LSE, a multi-disciplinary research group aiming to further the \nuse of psychoanalysis as a means of social and political analysis. \n \nReferences \nBhabha, H.
