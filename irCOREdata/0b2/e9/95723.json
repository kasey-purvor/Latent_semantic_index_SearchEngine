Invitations to such \ntypes of \u2018ethical\u2019 or \u2018political\u2019 consumption, phrased in more or less explicit ways, \nabound on alternative civic sites on the internet. Such invitations can be seen to \nreflect the contemporary notion of the \u2018citizen-consumer\u2019 (Scammell, 2000), and are \nbelieved by some to have a particular application to young people. They do, perhaps, \nsound much more fun and \u2018cooler\u2019 than the repeated injunction to read the \nnewspapers, to go along and vote, or even to participate in official institutions such \nas \u2018youth parliaments\u2019. Indeed, for those who espouse it, \u2018ethical consumption\u2019 may \nbe thought to have the added benefit of getting results more quickly than the four-\nyearly elections which are perceived by some young people to make very little real \ndifference to their lives (White, Bruce and Ritchie, 2000). On the face of it, anyone \ncan accept such invitations and make an active contribution to democracy. But are \nsuch assumptions justified?  \n \nThis paper is based on research being carried out in the UK for the pan-European \nproject \u2018Civicweb: Young People, the Internet and Civic Participation\u20191. The broader \nproject, which is being conducted in seven European countries, is concerned with the \nrole of the internet as a means of promoting civic engagement and participation \namong young people aged 15-25. We are examining the types of civic and political \ncontent available for young people on the internet as well as the stated reasons why \nsuch websites are being produced. We are particularly interested in the values and \n                                                 \n1 This research is funded by the European Commission under Framework 6 on Targeted Socio-\nEconomic Research: see www.civicweb.eu.  \n \n1\nbeliefs of those who create and manage the websites, and the interpretations, beliefs \nand on- and off-line actions of the youth who visit them. The question of why certain \npolitical and civic sites are more successful at engaging youth than others is a prime \nconsideration, and is explored via an analysis of their rhetorics, appeals and \npedagogic strategies.  \n \nOur focus in this paper is on one specific aspect of this phenomenon, namely the use \nof websites to promote \u2018ethical consumption\u2019 among young people. It is worth \ndistinguishing at this point between ethical consumption and politically-motivated \nconsumption more broadly. There is a very long history of \u2018consumer power\u2019 \u2013 for \nexample in the form of boycotts or \u2018buycotts\u2019 - being used in the service of particular \npolitical causes or social movements (Cohen, 2004). However, it is clear that \nconsumption for overtly political reasons is not an intrinsically benign or even \nnecessarily pro-democratic phenomenon, and can be used for very different \npurposes. For example, Matthew Paterson (2005) describes how in response to the \neconomic panic engendered by the September 11th attacks in America, everyone \n\u2018from George W Bush down, politicians and corporate elites\u2019, urged Americans to \n\u2018buy more stuff\u2019, first and foremost airline tickets, as a means of fulfilling their patriotic \nduty. By contrast, ethical consumption, as we understand it, is a term that is generally \nemployed by those on the political left: it typically refers to consumption decisions \nthat are made on the basis of concerns to do with human rights, environmental \nsustainability, animal welfare, fair trade or humane working practices. \n \nThis paper begins by briefly examining several intersecting literatures discussing not-\nfor-profit marketing, commercial marketing, youth cultures and subcultures, politics \nand ethical consumerism. We then move on to examine the rhetorical constructions \nof youth identity and ethical consumerism on a range of civic websites, exploring the \nidentifications and disavowals implicit in the language, layout and imagery, and the \nconceptualisations civic-orientated web producers have of their audiences and of \nconsumption per se. This will be done by taking a case-study approach, involving a \nqualitative textual analysis of web-pages taken from sites such as Adbusters, \nOxfam\u2019s Generation Why, Ethics Girls, Adili and Amnesty International which \nadvertise or promote the buying of ethical goods by young people. It will also involve \nan analysis of the aims of the site producers, as exemplified on the sites\u2019 mission \n \n2\nstatements or in in-depth interviews. By means of this analysis, we seek to identify \nand assess the actually or potentially \u2018civic\u2019 aspects of these sites and to question the \nnotion of ethical consumption in particular. \n \n \nEthical consumption: dilemmas and debates \n \nIn many respects, the issue of ethical consumption brings into focus broader \narguments both about the changing nature of civic and political participation, and \nabout the role of consumerism, in contemporary democracies. The literature on \nsocial capital typically suggests that mass consumption is inimical to civic \nparticipation, and that the rise of mass media and consumerism has been a key \nfactor in the demise of a healthy civic culture (Putnam, 2000). By contrast, social \ntheorists such as Giddens (1991: 209-231) establish a contrast between \u2019old\u2019 and \n\u2018new\u2019 politics, where \u2018emancipatory politics\u2019 corresponds roughly to conventional \npolitics and \u2018life politics\u2019 encompasses the politics of (new) social movements. Ethical \nconsumerism (and associated notions such as \u2018sustainable consumerism\u2019 and \u2018fair \ntrade\u2019) represents a clear instance of Giddens\u2019 second conceptualization. It is the \nactive conjunction of this \u2018new\u2019 politics with \u2018new\u2019 technology by civic organizations \nseeking to engage apparently new groups of young citizens which particularly \ninterests us here.  \n \nThe research we have carried out so far has discovered that many civic websites \ntargeted at young people tend to highlight \u2018life politics\u2019 or ethical consumerism rather \nthan an appeal to conventional forms of political activity (CivicWeb, 2007). But as \nTallontire, Rentsendodj and Blowfield ask in their literature review on this subject, \n\u2018Who is the ethical consumer, and what do they mean by ethical consumption?\u2019 \n(2001: 1). What is considered \u2018ethical\u2019 is by no means absolute: many criteria may \ncome into play in determining degrees of \u2018ethicality\u2019, and such criteria may quite \nfrequently conflict with each other. For example, is any buying ethical if the product is \n\u2018organic\u2019? Does such buying constitute political action only if those who made it \nreceive the entire profit, or is it acceptable for some of the profits of third-world labour \nto go to \u2018ethical\u2019 civic organisations? How strongly should environmental and \u2018green\u2019 \nconsiderations weigh in the balance if a product is branded \u2018fair trade\u2019?  \n \n3\n Research on the practices of self-professed ethical consumers has revealed \ninteresting hierarchies in terms of how products are graded according to an unwritten \nethical scale of virtue. By means of a survey distributed via the UK\u2019s Ethical \nConsumer magazine, Wheale and Hinton (2007) attempt to identify what they call \n\u2018ethical drivers\u2019 attached to specific groups of products, from clothing to electronic \ngoods. Their findings indicate that environmental issues are ranked above human \nrights and animal rights\/welfare issues, and that the ethical consumer considers the \nproduct groups themselves to have differential importance, ranging from food \nproducts, which are most strongly associated with ethical issues, to the brown goods \ngroup (electrical goods such as stereos and TVs), which proved to be least \nassociated with these issues. Their examination of the motivating factors within each \ngroup suggests that ethical consumers consider each product group on the basis of \nits bundle of ethical attributes, with varying levels of importance attributed to each \nissue within the decision to consume or buy. Similar findings are apparent in the \nstudy by Young, McDonald and Oates (2006), which suggests that consumers face a \ncomplex task in balancing out such diverse criteria in making purchasing decisions: \nbeing a \u2018green consumer\u2019 is not a simple, either\/or matter, but something that \ninvolves compromises and trade-offs \u2013 and often contradictions. \n \nInternational studies of young people\u2019s conceptions of ethical consumption (e.g. Autio \nand Heinonen 2004; Stolle, Hooghe and Micheletti 2005) suggest that there are often \ngaps between rhetoric and reality in this area \u2013 that is, between the attitudes young \npeople profess (not least in response to researchers\u2019 enquiries) and their actual \nbehaviour. Those for whom ethical considerations are paramount are in a small \nminority; and in practice, consumers tend to make contingent, and often quite \ninconsistent, purchasing decisions. This is partly to do with questions of availability \nand price (since \u2018ethical\u2019 goods are invariably more expensive than their \u2018unethical\u2019 \nequivalents); and partly to do with the availability and reliability of the information that \nwould help consumers reach such decisions. However, it also reflects the extent to \nwhich consumers have the time or inclination to prioritise the issue; and the \n \n4\ncontinuing influence of essentially \u2018non-rational\u2019 (for example, emotional, symbolic or \naesthetic) dimensions of consumer behaviour.2  \n \nWhile we should beware of equating consumption with purchasing power, these and \nother studies also suggest that ethical consumption tends to be concentrated among \nsocial groups that are already economically privileged. Micheletti et al. (2004) note \nthat historically people\u2019s religious, ethnic or gender identities have often been \nassociated with purchasing or with the boycotting of products to political effect, but \nthat it is the \u2018empowered and embedded\u2019 people who nowadays use their purchasing \npower as a political tool.  For example, Tallontire, Rentsendodj and Blowfield are not \nalone in finding that, \u2018[r]egular fair-trade buyers are untypical of the population as a \nwhole: they are better educated, wealthier, mostly female, over 30 years of age and \ntend to work in the public sector or \u201ccaring professions\u201d\u2019 (2001:17). In this typology, \nclass and spending power play a clear role either as a motivator or as an enabler of \ncivic participation. Given that young people as a whole tend to have less spending \npower than adults, there may be good grounds for questioning the idea that \npromoting ethical consumption is in fact a means of extending the democratic \nparticipation of youth.  \n \nSuch findings also feed into more general debates about the political implications of \nethical consumption. Advocates such as Norris (2002) see ethical shopping as a form \nof politics that is all about \u2018purposive collective action\u2019 aiming to redress social \ninequalities. In their collection on political consumerism, Michele Micheletti, Andreas \nFollesdal and Dietlind Stolle likewise argue that \u2018[p]olitical consumerism \nacknowledges the new power of corporations and uses the market as a powerful site \nfor politics\u2019 (2004: ix). However, others suggest that, far from representing a \nchallenge to the power of global capitalism, ethical consumption is a merely \nindividualistic strategy that is complicit with neoliberalism. George Hoare, for \nexample, argues on this basis that it can reinforce political quietism and apathy: \n \nEthical shopping is often argued to represent a \u2018new\u2019 form of political \nengagement (see Norris 2002), one which particularly appeals to those who \n                                                 \n2 The findings of such research are also borne out in some online youth forums, such as a recent \n\u2018Generation Europe\u2019 discussion: http:\/\/www.generation-europe.eu.com\/content\/view\/78\/15\/  \n \n5\nregard themselves as having disengaged entirely from formal, parliamentary \npolitics. However, we cannot forget that there is a sense in which ethical \nshopping is non-collective and focuses on the individual, and is confined to the \nrole of a choice which, while important, we might plausibly argue is a matter of \nprivate morals. There is a danger that ethical shopping represents (or, less \nlikely, but more worryingly, feeds into) a state of disengagement from politics \nas purposive, collective action concerned with altering the distributional values \nof social institutions. (Hoare, 2007: n.p.) \n \nMicheletti et al. (2004: xv) identify a range of opinions on these issues, including \nthose who argue that political or ethical consumption is a creative response by \ncitizens to bad governance (Beck 2000); those who see consumer action as a \u2018partial \nanswer to the negative side-effects of globalisation (Moberg, 2001)\u2019; and those who \nremain sceptical about a form of action that they feel can attract only the \u2018wealthiest \nand most established people and therefore reproduces patterns of marginalisation, \npowerlessness and disembeddedness nationally and globally (Basu, 2001)\u2019. As \nPaterson (2005) notes, it is undoubtedly true that failures in older forms of social \ndemocratic political action have fuelled \u2018new consumer movements\u2019 such as the anti-\nsweatshops campaigns; yet we have also seen a consumerisation of politics, for \nexample in the increasing use of focus groups to establish typologies linking voting \nintentions to particular patterns of consumer behaviour.  \n \nSo are even anti-corporate and \u2018ethical\u2019 businesses \u2013 and the people who choose to \nbuy from them \u2013 in fact operating to sustain the system some of them would wish to \nundermine? Paul Kennedy\u2019s analysis of \u2018ethical\u2019 and \u2018green\u2019 businesses in the UK \nhighlights some of the contradictions between business practices and the marketing \nof lifestyle or ethical products. Drawing on postmodernist accounts of consumption as \na set of symbolic practices, he introduces the idea of virtuous buying (2004: 26): \n\u2018Given that the moralisation of consumer practices involves the deliberate attempt to \ncombine lifestyle preferences with \u2018goodness\u2019, and\/or political correctness \u2013 both \nessentially symbolic qualities \u2013 some forms of commercialised signifying culture can \nbe made to work for the environment and social justice rather than against them\u2019. \nNevertheless, Kennedy\u2019s survey of stakeholders who run both \u2018mainstream\u2019 and \n\u2018radical\u2019 ethical\/green businesses reveals interesting fault lines between ethical \n \n6\npolitical ideals and business realities. While all the enterprises he examined were \n\u2018commodifying ethicality or selling the proofs of moral virtue\u2019 (2004: 33), they were \nconscious of having to create and maintain the markets for their goods. This \nconsciousness affected mainstream and radical or alternative businesses in different \nways, but Kennedy concludes that in seeking to compete and maintain their share of \nthe market, the more principled, political and radical green\/ethical businesses may \nhave to follow some of the \u2018unashamedly commercial\u2019 strategies of mainstream \nbusinesses. As he concludes (2004: 41), \u2018[t]he marriage of profit with principle is an \nuneasy one\u2019.  \n \nEven so, there is a danger of oversimplifying the debate if we see ethical \nconsumption as an alternative to other forms of civic or political action. As Clarke et \nal. (2007) suggest, ethical consumption campaigns are typically seen by their \nadvocates as one among a broader array of political strategies, and not as a \nsubstitute for them. Such campaigns do typically target those who are already \ncommitted to the issues, but they serve as a complement to other forms of action. \nThey also help to build networks among activists, and to promote the visibility of such \ndebates within the wider public sphere. As such, these authors suggest, it may be \nfalse to see ethical consumption as merely an individualistic or privatised strategy \u2013 \nor indeed to regard consumerism as somehow essentially distinct from, much less \nopposed to, the domain of politics and civic life.       \n \n \nThe rhetorical appeals of marketing: \u2018cool\u2019, \u2018alternative\u2019 and \u2018countercultural\u2019 \nproducts \n \nWhile the question of social class and democratic access is threaded throughout our \nanalysis, we also need to consider the strategies that are used in marketing \nfashionable, \u2018cool\u2019 or \u2018hot\u2019 products \u2013 from clothing and jewellery to trees, holidays \nand sponsored gifts \u2013 by appealing to their \u2018ethical\u2019 credentials. As we shall see, the \nlanguage used in such campaigns aimed at young people appeals simultaneously to \nthe wish to consume or buy products (and hence reflects broader rhetorics within \nmainstream marketing and consumer culture), and to the desire to do so in ways that \nare \u2018ethical\u2019 (which relates to the realms of social responsibility, citizenship and\/or \n \n7\npolitics). Their sales pitch is one which takes activities or values that are often seen \nas undesirable, unfashionable or uninteresting \u2013 not least because of their apparent \nidentification with adults \u2013 and seeks to redefine them as, on the contrary, desirable \u2013 \nnot least through their association with characteristics that are implicitly perceived as \ninherently and exclusively youthful. As we shall see, there is an apparent tension \nhere, which the sites seek to resolve by appealing to the notion that such goods are \n\u2018alternative\u2019 or \u2018radical\u2019 \u2013 and hence, it would seem, necessarily \u2018cool\u2019.   \n \nYet this tension is difficult to overcome, not least because what counts as \u2018ethical\u2019 or \nas \u2018cool\u2019 is not necessarily stable or easy to define. Thus, as we have noted, the term \n\u2018ethical\u2019 itself is neither used nor understood in a straightforward manner. Potentially, \nit could refer to environmentally sustainable practices, fair payment to producers for \ngoods, production in sanitary and safe conditions, organic farming, the buying of \nproduce from specific countries and companies, or politically anti-authoritarian \nproduction techniques or regimes. Each of these dimensions has a provenance and \na history in the realms of business and marketing, neoliberal, liberal-democratic or \nleftwing activist politics and environmentalism, as well as in the domains of charity \nshops, non-governmental marketing and charity purchasing that long pre-date the \nadvent of the Internet.  \n \nLikewise, the notion of \u2018cool\u2019 has a long history in marketing to children and young \npeople (see Cross, 2004; MacAdams, 2002). Yet while the term is apparently \nunderstood by millions of consumers young and old, cultural products cannot be \nseen as intrinsically \u2018cool\u2019 or indeed \u2018uncool\u2019. Some argue that the whole notion of \ncool is nothing more than a tactic generated by corporations (such as Nickelodeon, \nNike, Reebok and Levis Jeans) to sell more products to bemused, easily influenced \nyoung consumers (Quart, 2004). However, marketers typically suggest that achieving \nand maintaining the status of \u2018cool\u2019 is particularly difficult given the volatility of the \nyouth market (del Vecchio, 1997). What qualifies as cool is ever-changing and \nfrequently contested, and varies significantly in different contexts and settings: even \nwithin the mass consumer market, appealing to some universal notion of cool is an \ninherently risky strategy.  \n \n \n8\nNotions of 'alternative' and \u2018countercultural\u2019 cool are of course a staple element of \nyouth culture. Yet here again, the forms of \u2018subcultural capital\u2019 that are at stake in \ndefining what is authentic, or in maintaining distinctions between the \u2018alternative\u2019 and \nthe commercial \u2018mainstream\u2019, are subject to constant change and negotiation \n(Thornton, 1995). The association between particular forms of youth cultural \u2018style\u2019 \n(as embodied in music, fashion and visual design) and particular political positions or \norientations are equally complex and contested: it is certainly hazardous in the \ncontemporary world to assume a necessary \u2018homology\u2019 between such forms of \ncultural expression and a given social location, even if youth cultural theorists may \nhave argued as such several decades ago (e.g. Hebdige, 1979).  This is not to \nsuggest that such aspects are merely \u2018empty signifiers\u2019 which can be assigned any \nmeaning whatsoever; but it is to imply that cultural forms and fashions play a \ncomplex and ambivalent role in processes of identity building and formation.  \n \nNaomi Klein, adbusters founder Kalle Lasn (Klein, 1999; Lasn, 2000) and other high-\nprofile opponents of \u2018brand culture\u2019 and corporate power would have us believe that \nconsumption in an \u2018ethical register\u2019 is not only possible and occurring but has \ncategorically different outcomes and motivations from those of the mass marketing \nand consumption that defines mainstream \u2018cool\u2019. One such believer in \u2018culture \njamming\u2019 as a political tool is Jonah Peretti, who engaged the Nike corporation in an \nemail exchange about making a customised trainer with \u2018Sweatshop\u2019 written on it, \nonly to find the entire exchange circulating around the world wide web and attracting \nan unprecedented amount of both positive and negative political comment. According \nto Peretti, \u2018culture jamming promotes change by making citizens aware of the \ncontradictions in corporate policy and practice\u2019 (2004: 136); it also \u2018provides a new \ntype of free speech tailored to a media-saturated environment\u2019 (2004: 137). This is \ncertainly an idea that websites such as Oxfam\u2019s Generation Why, Amnesty \nInternational, Adili and Ethics Girls attempt to use in more or less political \u2013 and \nsimultaneously more or less commercial \u2013 ways.  \n \nHowever, other cultural critics differ on the possible outcomes of such practices. \nAccording to Heath and Potter (2005), rather than being part of a cultural rebellion \nagainst mainstream capitalist culture, alternative goods and culture jam ideas are \nenmeshed just as firmly with the capitalist system as any Nike trainer or FCUK \n \n9\nsweatshirt. In describing the idea of cultural critique popularised by Kalle Lasn in his \nbook Culture Jam, Heath and Potter satirise the belief that any form of consumption \ncan be \u2018outside the system\u2019: \n \nTraditional political activism is useless. It's like trying to reform political \ninstitutions inside the Matrix. What's the point? What we really need to do is to \nwake people up, unplug them, free them from the grip of the spectacle. And \nthe way to do that is by producing cognitive dissonance, through symbolic acts \nof resistance to suggest that something is not right in the world... Since the \nentire culture is nothing but a system of ideology, the only way to liberate \noneself and others is to resist the culture in its entirety. This is where the idea \nof counterculture comes from. (2005: 9) \n \nHeath and Potter argue that this inflated belief in the rebellious power of the \ncounterculture \u2013 whether in the form of so-called \u2018ethical clothing\u2019, \u2018organic food\u2019 or a \nrefusal of social conventions such as drug laws \u2013 undermines traditional activism. \nInstead of helping disenfranchised groups, countercultural critique and the actions \nassociated with it remove attention from huge social differences in wealth and \npoverty, thus preventing engagement with trade unions or voting, and generally \nundermining moves towards much-needed social reform. According to Heath and \nPotter, those who buy into the \u2018myth\u2019 of counterculture come to regard issues of \nsocial justice or government irresponsibility as mere illusions, part of the grand \nideology which controls people\u2019s behaviour. Yet they propose that, on the contrary, \nthe counterculture itself is a grand illusion, one which is a logical extension of \u2013 and \nwhich inherently sustains and invigorates \u2013 the individualistic ideology of consumer \ncapitalism.  \n \nSome support for Heath and Potter\u2019s argument may be found in a brief examination \nof the Adbusters website. Adbusters, known for its satirical take on commercial \nadvertising, specialises in what it calls \u2018fearless anti-corporate criticism\u2019 but at the \nsame time wishes to become a major online hub for the marketing of a particular set \nof \u2018alternative\u2019 cultural products ranging from books and shoes to posters and \nelectronic gadgets. Thus, the featured item on the page shown in Figure 1 is a pair of \n\u2018Blackspot shoes\u2019 which are \u2018Organic Hemp, Cruelty Free, Anti-Sweatshop and Pro-\n \n10\ngrassroots\u2019. Each of these labels carries a notional lifestyle politics in its wake and at \nthe same time acts to market the product in a way that mirrors commercial marketing \ntechniques by appealing to key markers of identity \u2013 authenticity, individuality and \nsocial responsibility.  \n \n \n \nFIGURE 1: Adbusters, The Culture Shop \n \nUltimately, however, Heath and Potter seem to accuse representatives of the \ncounterculture \u2013 among them the ethical consumers we are concerned with here \u2013 of \nsuffering from a form of false consciousness, or at least of being victims of a kind of \nideological confidence trick just as damaging as the consumer culture they seek to \noppose.  Yet are such criticisms fair to most of those who wish to challenge brand \nsociety by buying unbranded or ethically labelled goods \u2013 and do they do justice to \n \n11\nthe ethical consumption and political buying options that exist on the websites we \nnow go on to consider? \n \n \nMethodology \n \nFor this section, we draw on our qualitative analysis of a range of youth civic \nwebsites, covering issues of content, design and interactivity. This analysis provides \nan in-depth understanding of the different ways in which issues are represented, and \nin which young people who visit the site are addressed, constructed and invited to \nparticipate. Within the broader sample of sites we have analysed in the project, we \ncompare sites that appear to be adopting relatively traditional approaches, both to \nyouth civic participation and to the Web as a medium, with those that are more \ninnovative (Civicweb, forthcoming). Here we focus specifically on those that have as \nan aspect or central part of their campaign ethos an invitation to young people to \nconsume in particular ways as ethical and political citizens. Our analysis employs \nbroadly social-semiotic approaches (Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996, 2001), and \nbuilds on emerging work focusing specifically on websites (Buckingham and Scanlon, \n2004; Burn and Parker, 2003).  \n \nAmong the questions and themes we have addressed in our broader analysis are the \nfollowing: \n \n\u2022 Multimodality. How does the site use different modes of communication, and for \nwhat purposes? For example, is it predominantly text-based? Do the images \nfunction merely as illustrations, or play a more prominent role? How are users \ninvited to \u2018read\u2019 these different modes? \n \n\u2022 Navigation. How does the site direct users through the material? How do links \nwithin the site and between sites help to support and legitimate the information \nprovided on any given site? \n \n\u2022 Address. How is the user addressed, both verbally and visually? For example, is \nthe tone formal and impersonal, or informal and personalised? What assumptions \n \n12\nare made about the characteristics (needs, interests, cultural orientations) of \nyoung people in particular? To what extent, and how, is the site teaching, selling, \nor engaging the user in a dialogue? \n \n\u2022 Representation. In what ways does the site frame and convey the ethical issues \nwith which it is concerned? How are these issues invoked in the specific act of \nmarketing goods? To what extent are young people themselves represented as \nagents or merely as \u2018consumers\u2019? How is the ethical status of the goods \nestablished and legitimated? \n \n \nGeneration Why: Constructing the Young Ethical Consumer \n \nWe begin by analysing one UK youth civic site, Oxfam\u2019s Generation Why, looking at \nthe site as a whole rather than simply the pages that focus on marketing. Other sites \nsuch as Ethics Girls, Adili, Amnesty International and Adbusters (above) are \nreferenced with a more specific focus on their marketing pages, the kinds of products \nsold and the language and ideological appeals used to sell them to young people. \n \nThe explicit aims of Oxfam\u2019s Generation Why website are embodied in its strap-line: \n\u2018Do what you love doing - just change the world while you are doing it\u2019.  The site \nseeks to get young people involved in campaigning on Oxfam projects through the \nactivities that they already \u2018love doing\u2019 such as popular music, shopping, sport, \ncinema, writing and a variety of other arenas. There are obvious assumptions being \nmade here about what it is that young people really like doing in their spare time, for \npleasure. These assumptions may in themselves suggest an in-built appeal to \nmiddle-class youth, which is an issue that will be pursued further in this analysis.  \n \nThe site\u2019s politics are left-leaning liberal on most issues and, in line with Oxfam\u2019s \ncampaigning status, more pronouncedly left-wing on issues to do with international \ndevelopment. According to the site producer whom we interviewed3, their broad \nmission in terms of young people\u2019s civic participation is getting \u2018a broad agreement to \n                                                 \n3 Interview between Ben Beaumont, Web Editor, Oxfam-Generation Why and \nShakuntala Banaji, February 2007. \n \n13\nwork with others to eradicate poverty around the world\u2019. Their conception of civic \nparticipation and action thus ranges from shopping for \u2018ethical\u2019 goods to campaigning \naround trade laws, fund raising, donating (although this is not considered a priority, in \nthat young people are acknowledged as having less money), lobbying government \nand international corporations, volunteering, demonstrating and writing letters and \nsigning petitions. They also encourage online polls on issues that broadly relate to \nthe politics of the website. Early in 2008, for instance, the question was: \u2018We know \nyou\u2019ve made an ethical new year\u2019s resolution (haven\u2019t you?) But what is it?\u2019 and the \noptions given were \u2018Buy more fair trade produce\u2019; \u2018Recycle more rubbish\u2019; \u2018Save \nenergy at home\u2019 and so on.   \n \nInvitations to young people to contribute feature on various pages of the Generation \nWhy site, and cover both volunteering for Generation Why\/Oxfam projects and \nwriting up stories on relevant topics or issues (Figure 2):  \n \n \nFIGURE 2: Generation Why, December 19th 2007 \n \nThe content here tends to focus heavily but not exclusively on \u2018life politics\u2019. Figure 2 \nabove gives an example of an article featuring a young woman discussing ways of \nshopping more ethically for Christmas presents. Below the article, there is a \ncomment from another young woman asserting that she will use only old newspaper \nto wrap presents and thus save on the wrapping paper this year, and suggesting that \n \n14\nshe has been inspired to do this by reading this article. The ethical appeal here is \ntwofold: by refusing to buy lots of extra toys, paper, tinsel and other unnecessary \nornaments, one can save a large amount of money which can then be donated to \ncharity and used for the improvement of people\u2019s lives in poorer countries; but at the \nsame time one is being environmentally friendly by recycling and making better use \nof existing resources. Both these options are explicitly labelled \u2018ethical\u2019. The appeal \nhere involves an element of push (or social challenge) and pull (or emotional \nencouragement). It implicitly proposes that young people will feel able to do \nsomething about the environment and that they will be acknowledged for doing so: \nthey will achieve political agency as well as admiration and social status. \n \nGeneration Why was set up to target a younger audience than that of the traditional \nOxfam website, which is seen to appeal to a more traditional, older audience. The \nweb producer whom we interviewed about Generation Why explained: \n \n\u2026obviously people have a lot of different opinions about what Oxfam is, like \n[they might think it is] a bit old, maybe a bit unfashionable, and we were kind \nof meant to challenge those perceptions via a website that would engage \nyoung people on their level in an uncomplicated way \u2013 so Generation Why \nwas started to put across everything that Oxfam does. (Producer Interview \nwith SB, February 2007) \n \nThe producer\u2019s evidence and the site itself appears to take seriously the suggestions \nof Charities Aid Foundation researchers Catherine Walker and Andrew Fisher (2002) \nthat young people are often disengaged from political or charitable causes for lack of \nopportunity or lack of attempt to engage them. These authors suggest that young \npeople are actually keen to be involved but that existing approaches to fundraising \nfrom them need to be adapted to take account of their concerns, activities and \nenjoyments. Rather than \u2018preaching to the converted\u2019, then, a key aim is to reach out \nto young people who may not already have a commitment to Oxfam\u2019s ethical or \npolitical perspective; and this is reflected both in the visual design of the site and in \nthe written content. Thus, the Generation Why team particularly strive to avoid a \ncensorious or patronising tone: they seek to take account of what young people like \n \n15\ndoing rather than implying that all fun is bad or negative. Hence, music and shopping \nare used \n \nto reach out to new audiences because \u2026there\u2019ll always be a body of young \npeople who are motivated by social justice and social justice issues in its own \nright and you won\u2019t need to engage them through music as they\u2019re passionate \nabout justice anyway. But \u2026 if you\u2019re into music or you\u2019re into fashion you can \nstill have a positive impact on the world. (Producer interview, ibid.) \n \nHowever, there are questions that could be raised about the kinds of young people \nwho might be attracted to this website and by this approach. According to the website \nproducers\u2019 information, the large majority of users are probably middle-class, and \nmany are at college or university. More than two thirds of them are young women. \nThis gender and class profile is particularly apparent in the user contributions, which \nare largely from university students, and cover issues such as \u2018how to get on the \ncharity career ladder\u2019. It is also apparent in the tone, mood and style of the writing. As \nwe have noted, the aim here is to engage visitors\u2019 attention to issues of injustice or \ninequality, locally or globally, via an enthusiastic focus on their supposed primary \ninterests \u2013 music, tourism, television, shopping, and so on. The mood tends to be \nupbeat but also at times annoyed and encouraging of activism. Rather than \nsuggesting that no-one is to blame for the injustices, there is a clear sense that \nbusiness as usual between governments and corporations is not acceptable.  \n \nThe style of the writing is more difficult to define. In the UK, it might be said to draw \non a very particular class register \u2013 Standard English. It has a deliberately informal, \n\u2018cool\u2019 or slangy twist at times, but is also highly erudite and relatively formal at other \npoints. There is an avoidance of jargon, and where it is used it is explained, in line \nwith a pedagogic approach that seeks not to alienate young people or to make them \nfeel that civic actions are hard work. Users are encouraged to think that all their \nactions are \u2018making a difference\u2019 and regaled with imperatives: \u2018DO It Now!\u2019 \n\u2018Challenge your mates\u2019. There are also lots of questions, both pointed and rhetorical, \nbuilt into the appeals to young people, a pedagogic strategy intended to reduce the \ndistance between the writers and readers, bringing them onto the same level and \nlending a personalised, intimate edge. The appeal to ethical consumption thus entails \n \n16\nan assumption that readers will possess a shared understanding of what is ethical, \nwhile at the same time seeking to engage them with a specific form of received slang \nwhich confers social \u2018cool\u2019 on some items.  \n \nThis combination of didactic and consumer-oriented perspectives is achieved on \nmany different levels. For example, users are encouraged to read one of the \u2018Small \nGuides to Big Issues\u2019 that detail the historical background and explain terminology \naround issues from \u2018Climate Change\u2019 to \u2018Women\u2019s Rights\u2019. However, these guides \nare not available online and free of charge, as one might have expected given the \nproliferation of free information and discussion on the internet: clicking on the link to \nthe guides leads to a page advertising them. They are in hard copy only and cost \naround ten pounds each. Although written by serious political writers such as Jeremy \nSeabrook, the way in which these guides are presented on the advertising page and \nthe graphics on the front covers are reminiscent of young shoe-string or budget \nholiday and travel guides such as The Lonely Planet series or The Rough Guide. \nHere again, the iconography of the marketing links things that users apparently \u2018love \ndoing\u2019 (such as travelling and backpacking) to serious political issues.  \n \n \nShopping for Social Justice \n \nAs our Christmas shopping example implies, \u2018ethical consumption\u2019 sometimes \nappears to imply an overall reduction in consumption per se, not merely of \u2018unethical\u2019 \ncommodities, but also of any that are considered in some way unnecessary. Yet \nshopping is also implicitly seen here as one of the things that young people \u2018love \ndoing\u2019 for its own sake. One key aspect of the site\u2019s attempt to \u2018engage young people \non their level\u2019 is therefore to encourage them to buy, either from the site itself or from \nother charitable online \u2018ethical shopping\u2019 catalogues: \n \nWhy not buy from a charity-shop website, so that while you\u2019re still giving \nsomething meaningful to those you love, you\u2019re also helping to fight poverty \nand climate change? The Oxfam Unwrapped programme gives you the \nchance to buy a goat or a loo in the name of a mate and the chance to raise \nsome smiles, have a laugh and make some conversation whilst giving \n \n17\nsomeone something they really need. \n(http:\/\/www.oxfam.org.uk\/generationwhy\/yoursay\/articles\/yoursay263.htm) \nDecember 19th 2007. \n \nHere the language of commercial marketing is apparent in the appeal of the \u2018two for \none\u2019 idea. Ethical purchasing is its own reward, yet it also creates a pedagogical \nopportunity, to \u2018make some conversation\u2019 with one\u2019s friends, and thereby perhaps to \nraise their awareness of social and political issues. \n \nShopping itself features quite prominently on the site, especially around the time of \nevents such as Christmas, Easter or Valentine\u2019s Day, with young people being \nencouraged to shop but to do so in an \u2018ethical\u2019 manner by considering issues such as \nthe impact of cash crop farming in certain regions, paying farmers fairly for their \ntrade, encouraging non-genetically modified crops or organic farming, and so on. The \nsite features extensive opportunities to buy goods both for the consumer him- or \nherself \u2013 ranging from chocolate and clothing to CDs, DVDs, books and greetings \ncards \u2013 and for use in developing countries \u2013 for example, seeds, fertilizer, a goat, a \nchemical toilet or condoms to help in the fight against HIV\/AIDS.  \n \nFigure 3 shows the home page of Generation Why in the week leading up to \nChristmas in 2007. The strategic placement of the ethical t-shirt sale image and the \n\u2018everything half-price\u2019 slogan in the top right hand corner of the screen suggests that \ncharities such as Oxfam have taken lessons from commercial retailers seriously. \nTheir visual iconography in this instance references commercial marketing \ntechniques. This is also apparent in the notion of a sale, getting a bargain, the \nencouragement to buy based on scarcity of the product \u2013 \u2018your last chance to buy\u2019 - \nand the faintly ironic claim about the t-shirts\u2019  \u2018legendary\u2019 status.  \n \n \n \n18\n \nFIGURE 3: Generation Why Homepage, December 19th 2007 \n \n\u2018Hot ethical t-shirts\u2019, typically bearing slogans that promote humane working \nconditions or fair trade, or express opposition to the global arms trade, appear to be \nparticularly popular. Figure 4 features one design, \u2018Shop Till You Drop\u2019, drawing \nattention to the forced overtime and poor wages of garment workers in developing \ncountries. Here again, the product would appear to combine an element of \u2018cool\u2019 or \nfashionable style with an opportunity for educating one\u2019s friends about the message \nthat it conveys: it is simultaneously \u2018ethical\u2019 and \u2018hot\u2019.  \n \n \n \n19\nFIGURE 4: Generation Why: March 2008 \n \nAmnesty International, by contrast, do not emphasise the ethical features of their \nshopping list on the main pages of their site. Rather, shopping is seen primarily as an \nalternative way of donating to Amnesty and keeping the organisation running. While \nproducts are \u2018ethically sourced\u2019, shopping is seen here as essentially a form of \nfundraising (with prices incorporating a substantial donation to the organisation). On \nthe Webpage shown in Figure 5, shopping is one of the \u2018actions\u2019 that people can take \nto support Amnesty: \n \n \nFIGURE 5: Amnesty International, December 2007 \n \nNevertheless, by the time one reaches the Amnesty International UK online \ncatalogue pages, the language of ethical consumerism is everywhere (Figure 6). As \na potential young \u2018ethical consumer\u2019 surfing the Amnesty website, you are apparently \naided by the fact that their products have an \u2018ethical\u2019 product key, reminiscent of \nWheale and Hinton\u2019s \u2018ethical drivers\u2019 (2007) mentioned above. If you do not want to \nbuy Amnesty branded goods, you can purchase ones which fall into the category \nethical because they are flagged as \u2018Educational\u2019 or \u2018Eco-friendly\u2019 or \u2018Fair Trade\u2019. \n \n \n20\n \nFIGURE 6: Amnesty International, February 2008 \n \nThe goods on offer with Amnesty International UK are not cheap, and do not appear \nto be targeted primarily at young people or at people who view themselves as ethical \nconsumers. Rather, they assume that since many of their audience already consume \ncertain goods at some point or other, ethical shopping will be an acceptable way for \nthem to raise money. While using the language of ethical marketing on the shopping \npages of the site, Amnesty International clearly suggest on their homepage that \ndonating to Amnesty\u2019s Human Rights cause would be the primary function of the \nshopping on their site. In this sense, the pleasure and politics of ethical shopping is \nnot part of the primary ethos and political appeal of the site in the way it is for \nGeneration Why.  \n \n \nEthical Shopping: Ethics Girls and Adili \n \nMeanwhile, the consumerist ethos is even more apparent in the case of sites such as \nEthics Girls and Adili (see Figures 7 and 8). These sites are both essentially \u2018ethical \nshopping\u2019 sites, rather than sites whose primary rationale is to raise awareness or \nspread information about specific causes. At the time of this research, for example, \n \n21\nEthics Girls was strongly promoting winter fashions, along with a vast range of \nproducts from fairtrade chocolate and beauty products to \u2018eco sex toys\u2019 and vegan \ncondoms. As on Amazon, and other online shopping sites, it is possible here for \nusers to recommend products to each other (albeit primarily on ethical grounds), \nalongside those heavily promoted by the site itself.  \n \n \n \n \nFIGURES 7 AND 8: Ethics Girls, Adili, February 2008 \n \n22\n In the case of Generation Why and Amnesty International, shopping is somewhat \nmarginal to the structure of the site, although it is certainly strongly (and visually) \nflagged up on the home pages. By contrast, in the case of Ethics Girls, the activity of \nshopping is the central focus, and the information about ethical issues is less \nprominently displayed. The material relating to shopping is strongly visual, while that \nrelating to ethical and political issues is heavily verbal. The design of the site is also \nmore obviously gendered: the pink contrasts with the more neutral yellow of \nGeneration Why, and products are recommended with a pink heart icon. The \nlanguage is equally gendered \u2013 products are repeatedly praised as \u2018lovely\u2019, \n\u2018gorgeous\u2019 and \u2018delicious\u2019. Nevertheless, the design is significantly more grid-like than \na typical teen girls magazine, and the visual style is much less outrageously girl-\noriented than that of mainstream commercial girls\u2019 sites such as gurl.com (although \nthe target audience also appears to be somewhat older). The green leaf pattern on \nthe background of one site and the tree and outline of hills on the other (Figures 7 \nand 8) suggest connections to nature and natural processes. The understated \ncolouring of the writing, pale backgrounds and lack of interactive or flashy multimedia \noptions concentrate attention both on the individual products (in the manner of an \nexclusive boutique) and on the intended \u2018messages\u2019 on the explanatory pages. \n \nBoth sites overtly stress the ethical angle of their marketing campaign both in the \nmain page text and in their slogans \u2013 one is \u2018Set the example: ethical fashion, \nshopping & ideas\u2019 and the other is \u2018Just Ethical Brands\u2019, which plays on the word \n\u2018just\u2019. In these respects, the sites appear to be seeking a kind of compromise \nbetween an overtly commercial approach and the more \u2018worthy\u2019, didactic style of \nsites such as Ethical Consumer, which are more centrally focused on the social and \npolitical issues at stake, and significantly more text-based.   \n \nNevertheless, Adili in particular takes pains to substantiate the claims it makes to be \nengaging only in \u2018ethical\u2019 fashion. It has a number of pages of explanation and \ndiscussion which attempt to marry the languages of fashion and consumer choice \nwith those of politics. The following (Figures 9) is taken from a page selling gold and \nwhite gold jewellery with expensive price tags and the description that follows (Figure \n10) opens when the Ethical Fashion tab is clicked on the Homepage: \n \n23\n Ethically Mined Gold & White Gold \nFiFi Bijoux is committed to making a positive contribution to the people & communities it \nworks with, promoting positive ethics, offering an alternative to exploitation, human rights \nabuses or irresponsible damage to the environment   \n \nEthical Fashion \nThere's no point being coy about it, fashion can be a dirty business. Cotton \naccounts for just 3% of the world's agriculture, yet uses 25% of all insecticides and \n10% of all pesticides. At the same time the 40 million (mainly female) workers in \nthe global textile trade are the ones that pay the price for cheap clothing: long \nhours, poor wages, unsafe working conditions, abuse, harassment, discrimination. \nNot good.  \n \nThankfully it doesn't have to be this way. In recent years a number of pioneering \nbrands have started making clothes the ethical way. Best of all these clothes are \nsuperb, stylish pieces that make you look good and feel great. Isn't that what \nfashion should be about?  \n \nConsequently everything we stock tackles at least one of the environmental and \/or \nsocial issues involved in making, transporting and selling clothes. We assess both \nthe brand and their products against a set of ethical criteria covering environmental \nimpact, working conditions and fair trade. We don't expect perfection - garment \nsupply chains are often complex and fragmented and many ethical brands are still \nsmall companies, but we do look for real commitment.  \n \nHere's where we stand on the main environmental and social issues associated \nwith fashion:  \n \nFair Trade \nAlternative Fibres \nRecycled \nOrganic \nTraditional Skills \nLocally Sourced \nEnvironmental Impact \nCharitable Projects \nWorking Conditions and Labour Standards \nProgress Brands\nFIGURES 9 and 10: Adili, March 2008 \n \nAccording to this description, in order to qualify as ethical for trade on the Adili site, \nclothes must \u2018make you look good and feel great\u2019 but also tackle \u2018at least one of \n \n24\nenvironmental and\/or social issues involved in making, transporting and selling \nclothes\u2019. In principle, it would be possible for goods to qualify solely on the grounds \nthat they were recycled or involved traditional skills, irrespective of the fact that other \ncriteria were not met \u2013 an approach that, to say the least, significantly simplifies the \ndilemmas faced by ethical shoppers.  \n \n \nThe civic consumer \u2013 a contradiction in terms? \n \nSeveral commentators have argued that in late modernity consumption is one of the \nmain arenas in which young people\u2019s identities are shaped. For some, this is \nessentially a process of ideological recuperation. Steven Miles, for instance, writes \nthat: \n \nConsumption operates at both an immediate and a very subtle level. By \nconsuming a pair of training shoes, for example, a young person not only buys \ncomfort and a communal sense of wellbeing, but also legitimizes a way of life. \nBy consuming a pair of training shoes, the individual asserts his or her rights \nas a citizen of consumer culture, and effectively accepts the status quo. (2000: \n150) \n \nOn the other hand, authors such as Paul Willis (1990) and Mica Nava (1992) suggest \nthat consumer culture allows a much greater opportunity for creativity, and even for \nexpressions of political dissent. From this perspective, consumer culture becomes a \ndomain of \u2018symbolic creativity\u2019, in which young people actively appropriate cultural \ngoods and symbolic resources in seeking to fashion their own identities. \n \nIn the context of this (rather tiresomely polarized) debate, the issue of ethical \nconsumption raises some interesting paradoxes. As Heath and Potter point out, the \nargument that every cultural object is ideologically coded in an effort to sell more \ngoods cannot just arbitrarily stop at Nike trainers \u2013 it also applies to t-shirts made of \norganic cotton. While one may argue about (supposedly ethical) ends justifying \n(supposedly pragmatic) means (as in Kennedy\u2019s (2004) account of the dilemmas of \nethical marketers, discussed above), it is clear that lifestyles and identities are also \n \n25\nbeing symbolically hitched to ethical products, just as they are to mainstream ones. \nThere is certainly a broader debate to be had here about the ultimate significance of \nconsumer culture as against other determinants of people\u2019s identities and life \nchances (see Lodziak, 2002); but if we accept that (as Miles puts it) \u2018identities are \nincreasingly constructed through symbolic resources\u2019 (2000: 154), then the symbolic \nvalue of fair-trade, political-slogan-bearing or organic cotton t-shirts is as significant \nfor those who buy them as the connotations of sportiness or casual cool are for those \nwho purchase Nike. \n \nSo, if goods to be purchased can offer young people symbolic resources for building \ntheir identities as citizens, what are the identities being bought into by putative \npurchasers of \u2018hot ethical T-shirts\u2019 and recycled Christmas gifts? Just what kind of \npolitical or ethical claim is being made by a T-shirt that bears the fair-trade label? And \nare all such claims set out in the same way and equally justified? As such ideas play \nan increasingly important role in mainstream marketing, some of their inherent \nambiguities become apparent. As Smeltzer (2007), notes, labels such as Fair Trade \nare now being busily taken up by corporate interests:  \n \nHow should one asses that at the G8 summit 2005 in Gleneagles leaders of \nthose economically dominant countries that are continually held responsible \nfor global trade injustices (often by actors and organizations in the Fair Trade \nmovement) formally acknowledged the growing success of global Fair Trade \nand said in their final statement that they \u201cwelcome the growing market for Fair \nTrade goods and their positive effect in supporting livelihoods and increasing \npublic awareness of the positive role of trade in development\u201d? (Fair Trade \nAdvocacy Newsletter, 2005: 4) (Smeltzer 2007: 3) \n \nYet rather than suggesting that the idea of Fair Trade is \u2018pure\u2019 and has been co-opted \nfor \u2018unethical\u2019 reasons by elites, Smeltzer suggests that there are some inherent \nambiguities and contradictions in its meaning: the notion itself is \u2018a site of \ncontestation, conflict and negotiation between different actors\u2019, and defining what \nconstitutes \u2018fairness\u2019 in this context is by no means straightforward. Yet ultimately, as \nJulia Bonstein (2005) notes, mainstream corporations may well be the ones to benefit \nmost from an increased popular demand for \u2018ethical\u2019 products: \u2018Save the rainforests \n \n26\nby having a beer, help African school-children by eating chocolate: companies have \ndiscovered that the way to a customer's pocket is through his heart.\u2019 \n \nClarke et al. (2007) usefully question the assumption that \u2018the politics of consumption \nnaturally implies a problematisation of consumer identities\u2019. Their case study of \nethical consumers in the UK suggests that discursive interventions used in ethical \nconsumption campaigns (which include websites marketing ethical goods) aim to \nprovide information to people already disposed to support or sympathise with certain \ncauses. Crucially, they suggest that ethical marketing campaigns also tend to provide \nsupporters with \u2018narrative story-lines\u2019 (2007: 231). Such storylines are clearly visible \nin the content of Ethics Girls and Adili, as well as in a more nuanced form on \nGeneration Why. Obviously, political commitments are by no means simply a matter \nof rational choice \u2013 any more than consumer behaviour can be detached from its \nemotional and symbolic dimensions. Enabling people to feel virtuous about their \nconsumer choices, and using them to publicly express and extend their commitment \nto particular ethical positions, is obviously a powerful political strategy. But can a \ncombination of sympathy for a narrative storyline, which might encourage the buying \nof ethical products and support for the cause of fair trade, add up to a new form of \npolitical action? And can this be detached from the connotations of class and capital \nthat characterise the types of consumption being advocated?  \n \nGeorge Hoare\u2019s suggestion that we might \u2018distinguish between two outcomes of \nethical shopping\u2019, one a political outcome and one an apolitical one, goes some way \ntowards providing an answer to this question: \n \nAn apolitical outcome of ethical shopping is anything which is achieved \ncollectively in the weak sense: its realisation did not require a co-ordinated \ncampaign... A political outcome, on the other hand, is one which could not \nhave happened without a politically mobilised group behind it... Armed with \nthis distinction, I want to argue that the greatest danger of ethical shopping is \nthe possible achievement of apolitical outcomes. (Hoare, 2007: n.p.) \n \nThis conclusion is different from one that sees all \u2018ethical\u2019 consumer campaigns as \ncynical ploys or all \u2018ethical\u2019 consumers (whether young or old) as merely dupes or too \n \n27\nlazy to engage in real politics. It merely problematises - as several other writers \nquoted in this paper do - the idea that consumption, and the language that goes with \nit, can be stripped entirely of its negative, corporate or inegalitarian connotations and \nharnessed wholesale to revitalising democratic and political interest amongst young \npeople.  \n \nHowever, the distinction between apolitical and political outcomes brings with it a \nnew set of problematic assumptions. If one assumes political outcomes to be those \nthat impinge on governance or that affect relationships between groups of people \n(rich and poor, for instance, or developing world farmers and Western European \nretail chains), then one must also acknowledge that not all political outcomes are \nnecessarily democratic or beneficial to those in socially excluded positions. For \nexample, the protectionist stances taken by even avowedly left-leaning anti-\nglobalisation consumer groups in rich countries towards goods or labour from Asia \nand Latin America might be said to undermine rather than to enhance global social \njustice. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe sites we have considered in this paper can be seen to provide new and informal \nways of addressing young people simultaneously as citizens and as consumers. \nThey overtly legitimate shopping as a valid leisure pursuit, but also seek to construct \nit as an ethical practice. They build on the role of fashion and \u2018cool\u2019 as highly \nsignificant dimensions of commercial youth culture, and yet seek to mobilize these \nforms of cultural expression as a political tool. This is an inherently ambivalent and \npolitically risky strategy. Furthermore, the implicit linkage of consumer behaviour with \npro-democratic political intentions in the rhetoric of these sites side-steps both the \nsmall-scale social and the wider political implications of encouraging identity-\nconstruction and political expression through consumption. As Janelle Ward has \nnoted, \u2018even if theoretically speaking the Socially Conscious Consumer is given credit \nfor using her spending power wisely and demanding better working conditions in the \nthird world, for example, the equality of each and every citizen is deeply shaken \nwhen one-person-one-vote becomes one-dollar-one-vote\u2019 (2007: 18). We suggest \n \n28\nthat while traditionally old-fashioned constructions of politics and citizen behaviour \nmight have failed to engage many young people, the adoption by some civic \nwebsites of \u2018life politics\u2019 encouraging particular kinds of consumption may prove \nequally problematic, most notably in relation to continuing questions of social \ninequality. Consumption may indeed be seen as a form of political action; but even \nwhen it is applied in pursuit of social justice or democratic goals, it is not one that is \nequally available to all.  \n \n \n \n29\nREFERENCES \n \nAutio, M. and Heinonen, V.
