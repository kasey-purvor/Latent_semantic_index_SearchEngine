STB marketing personnel occupy the first space of  mediation.  Market  research\nprovides specialist knowledge of consumer expectations and key icons of Scotland  that  form  the\ndominant  ideological  foundations  upon  which  positive  discourses  of  place   are   constructed.\nPhotography occupies the second space of mediation. Directly influenced by marketing discourse,\nphotography becomes a highly  selective  process  as  photographers  directly  mediate  landscapes\nusing photographic techniques,  knowledge and artistic expertise to  convey  atmospheres,  moods\nand feelings of place, capturing consumers\u2019 attention and encouraging  imaginative  interpretation.\nDesign and the final presentation of images  in  brochures  occupy  the  third  space  of  mediation.\nBound by design briefs outlining mediated discourse, design mediation occurs as  designers  apply\nknowledge, skills and artistic expertise of  design  practices  and  create  new  ways  of  presenting\nimages in brochures.\nKeywords: Mediation, landscape, brochures, images, marketing, photographers, designers,\nprocesses, practices.\nIntroduction\nThis  paper  investigates  the  processes  and  practices   influencing   the   construction   of   visual\nrepresentations of place in tourist brochures. Discussion focuses on the  discursive  transformation\nof material landscapes into brochure images and  outlines  the  consumption  of  tourist  spaces  as\nimages in brochures depends upon a crucial  series  of  mediating  processes  and  practices  which\nshape image construction. This  research  identifies  the  example  of  the  Scottish  Tourist  Board\n(STB) and concentrates solely on the main UK and Overseas brochures for  2000.  Since  research\nwas conducted, a re-branding  of  the  Scottish  Tourist  Board  as  VisitScotland  has  occurred  in\naddition to changes and developments in marketing strategy and supplier  relations.  Nevertheless,\nthis research offers an insight into the spaces of mediation involved  in  image  construction,  from\nmarket research of consumer expectations, through physical  construction  of  images  to  the  final\npresentation of images in brochures.\nThe paper begins by outlining existing theoretical literatures on tourist brochures  and  the  role  of\nimages in  such  brochures.  Following  this,  I  argue  the  importance  of  photographic  theory  in\nunderstanding  practices  and  processes  of  mediation.  Drawing  upon  a  variety   of   theoretical\nstandpoints including those of Barthes (1977), Berger (1972), Sontag (1979), Tagg  (1987),  Adler\n& James (1988), the objective, evidential role of photography as an insight into a  reality  of  place\nis contrasted with Crang\u2019s (1997) notion of \u201cenworlded\u201d landscapes  that  present  tourists  with  a\nroute through which worlds are created. Images act as entrance points through which tourists enter\nlandscapes of place imaginatively, experiencing through individual interpretation and  idealisation\na  destination  that  is  inherently  bound  in  the  physical  materiality   of   landscapes.   However,\nfundamental to this paper are the complex mediating powers embodied in image construction  and\nthe interplay and difference between producing agents and are  subsequently  discussed  using  the\nempirical case study of STB.\nDespite  the  ubiquitous  status  of  brochures  in  the  tourism  industry,  the   academic   study   of\nbrochures was not taken seriously until the study by Thurot &  Thurot  (1983)  which  argued  that\nthe analysis of  tourist  representations  and  their  consumption  is  key  to  understanding  tourism\nphenomena.  Brochures  continue  to  substantiate   theoretical   standpoints   (MacCannell,   1973,\nCohen, 1993) but, a  continued  lack  of  interest  exists  in  the  ways  destinations  are  portrayed,\npackaged and presented (Dann, 1996).  Interpretative studies  of  the  relevance  of  brochures  and\nbrochure imagery remain ad hoc (e.g. Buck, 1977, Dilley, 1986, Urbain, 1989)  with  the  majority\nfocusing on quantitative  research  methods.  By  focusing  on  descriptive  and  systematic  image\nanalysis,  such  research  fails  to  address   the   deeper   socio-semiological   elements   of   image\nconstruction. Therefore, utilising a qualitative approach to research, I seek to  build  upon  existing\nliterature by authors such as Selwyn (1996) and Dann (1996) who combine elements of qualitative\nsemiology  and  quantitative  content  analysis  to  address   how   images   are   produced,   whilst\nemphasising mediated discourse as underlying image construction processes and practices.\nThe Continuing Role of Tourist  Brochures  and  the  Importance  of  Brochure\nImages\nTourists have an abundance of travel  literature  at  their  fingertips.  However,  despite  alternative\nmedia, such as guidebooks, television  and  the  Internet,  brochures  remain  the  key  promotional\ntool. Whilst the Internet provides a direct source of information, websites  are  often  analogous  to\n\u2018online brochures\u2019. Additionally, one continually faces  the  opportunity  to  \u2018request  a  brochure\u2019,\nhighlighting the continued demand for hard-copy brochures. Whilst guidebooks provide  valuable,\ndetailed  information  to  tourists  once  a  decision  on  a  destination  has  been  made,   brochures\ncontinue to occupy a  ubiquitous  status  within  the  tourism  industry  and  offer  the  majority  of\ntourists  their  initial  direct  contact  with  a  destination.  As  Middleton  (1994,   cit.   Morgan   &\nPritchard, 1998: 189) states:  \u2018the  travel  world  is  awash  with  brochures\u2019.  Indeed,  \u2018the  design,\nproduction and distribution of (the) annual tourism brochure is the single most important\u2026item in\nthe marketing budget\u2026the  brochure  is  arguably,  the  key  image  tool  in  tourism\u2019  (Morgan  &\nPritchard: 79). Despite criticism as essentially fraudulent (Boorstin, 1964),  and  constructed  from\ndistorted images of  place  (Britton,  1979),  brochures  communicate  vital  messages  to  potential\nconsumers, influencing consumer destination choice and bringing positive place characteristics  to\nlife.\nMany  authors  (see  Dann,  1993,  Fakeye  &  Crompton,  1991,  MacKay  &  Fesenmaier,   1997,\nMorgan & Pritchard, 1998) highlight brochures as  tools  to  inform,  persuade,  remind  and  elicit\nfurther inquiries about destinations by conveying positive messages to consumers. Integral to  this\nprocess  is  photography.  Brochures  are  highly  visual  in  nature  and   rely   upon   images   and\nphotographs to sell destinations as tourist places  become  immersed  in  the  language  of  visuals.\nNon-verbal communication  is  vital  as  holiday  purchases  are  based  on  symbolic  elements  of\ndestinations  conveyed  and  therefore  on  the  production,  re-production  and  re-enforcement  of\nimages  (Hall,   1998).   Emphasis   has   shifted   from   production   to   image,   advertising   and\nconsumption (Crick, 1989). \u2018Promotion is the product as far as the  tourist-prospect  is  concerned.\nThe customer buys a trip or a holiday purely  on  the  basis  of  symbolic  expectations  established\npromotionally through words, pictures, sounds, images, etc\u2019 (Season,  1989:  336,  cit.  Morgan  &\nPritchard, 1998: 45). Tourists become semioticians (Urry, 2002), seeking pre-established signs  of\nplace that offer pre-determined ways of seeing destinations.\nThe Power of Photography in Brochures: Presenting Mediated Fantasies  from\nMaterial Landscapes\nFounded within positivist intention, images may appear to offer evidence and truth of what  awaits\ntourists at destinations free from interpretation (Sontag, 1979, Ryan,  1997,  Tagg,  1987).  Indeed,\nMellinger  (1994)  and  Morgan  &  Pritchard  (1998)  suggest   that   the   magic   and   power   of\nphotography lies in the ability to represent reality objectively. Research has established images  as\n\u2018quotes\u2019 (Markwick, 2001), \u2018mirrors\u2019, reflective of  reality  (Adler,  1989,  Hamilton,  1997)  or  as\ntranscriptive of reality  (Berger  &  Mohr,  1982,  Urry,  2002).  However,  whilst  such  assertions\nshould not be dismissed, it is the insights presented by Crang  (1997)  that  form  the  basis  of  my\ninterpretation of images in brochures.\nSeeking an alternative to notions of images as reflections of reality,  Crang  proposes  that  images\nprovide a means through which to grasp the world. Appearing as established  realities,  landscapes\nare \u2018enworlded\u2019 and tourists are presented with a route through which worlds are created. Tourists\nare able to enter landscapes through mental  transportation,  and  experience  for  themselves  what\nlies beneath the banal surface of the image.  Images, do not simply transcribe reality,  but  are  \u2018the\nmore active labour of making things mean\u2019 (Hall, 1982, cit. Albers & James, 1988).  Fundamental\nto such understanding is semiology, in particular the work of Roland Barthes on the \u2018photographic\nmessage\u2019. Moving from his 1977 assertion of images  as  purely  denotative  \u2018messages  without  a\ncode\u2019,  Barthes  progressively  emptied  the  sign  of  all  cognitive  meaning  and   concluded   the\n\u2018photographic  message\u2019  transmits  meaning  through  photographs  via   a   complex   current   of\nmessages  and  meanings,  as  signifiers   and   signified   merge   through   signification   and   are\nsubsequently understood using interpretative codes. Deeper meanings, or \u2018myths\u2019,  then  penetrate\nimages to create counter-narratives that complement basic knowledge and meanings.\nIdeology is therefore inherent in image interpretation and  is  interwoven  in  the  construction  and\ninterpretation of signs (Barthes, 1967) as images  metaphorically  \u2018speak\u2019,  drawing  on  individual\nand collective ideologies and mental representations of place. Importance shifts from producers to\nspectators as readers of the text (Walker & Chaplin,  1997),  as  images  look  tourists  in  the  eye,\nchallenging  them  to  explore  their  hidden  depths.  This  highly  spectator-orientated  nature   of\nbrochure imagery (Berger, 1972) encourages individual ideological  interpretation  of  destinations\nas images focus upon tourists as individuals and encourage them to  place  themselves  within  the\nimage and enact the roles presented on the  brochure  page.   Focusing  on  \u2018you\u2019  (Selwyn,  1996),\nimages become \u2018little secrets\u2019 (Cohen, 1995) intended solely for individuals to enact fantasies  and\ndesires. Subconscious invitations and messages of \u2018it could be you\u2019  encourage  immersion  of  the\nself within the frame of the image, as the camera lens becomes the  eye  of  the  reader  (Hamilton,\n1997). Tourists are wooed and invited to dream beyond the surface of  the  image  as  they  engage\nwith imagined extra-ordinary tourist worlds and day-dream over destinations as they  engage  with\nvisual stimuli (Urry, 2002, Hummon, 1998). Photography therefore  enhances  how  tourists  \u2018see\u2019\ntouristic spaces, creating a series of gazes as images weave a veil of  fantasy  through  imagination\nthat ignites tourists\u2019 senses and they feel, touch, taste, smell and see what is shown.\nNevertheless, emphasis on consumers masks  complex  power  relations  that  exist  during  image\nconstruction and it is easy  to  assume  that  the  image  creation  process  is  largely  seamless,  for\nresearch is prone to  forgetting  the  tensions  and  complex  power  relationships  that  are  present\nduring image construction (Morgan &  Pritchard,  1998).  Complexities,  interplay  and  difference\nemerge at all stages of image construction and between numerous influencing  agents  involved  in\nthe process (e.g. local governments, tourism industry, host populations, etc). Whilst  the  scope  of\nthis paper does not permit the inclusion of all these agents, it focuses on the power differences and\ninterplays  between  marketing  managers,  photographers  and  designers  that   exist   during   the\nphysical production of brochure images. Image construction  becomes  a  series  of  spaces  within\nwhich numerous knowledges, expertise, agencies, practices and processes clash, complement  and\nconverge in the creation of the final product. Tourism images never  merely  present  what  is  \u2018out\nthere\u2019 (Barnes & Duncan, 1992), but subliminally guide  tourists  via  mediated  discourse  and  an\nagglomeration of producer interpretations.\nPine and Gilmore\u2019s (1999) five phases of experience planning provides a framework  upon  which\nthese powers of production can be analysed. Firstly, experiences to be presented to consumers  are\nrecognised. Secondly, experiences are  staged  and  scenes  set.  Brochures  become  analogous  to\ntheatres; the images stage scenes through which  consumers  enter  imaginative  touristscapes  and\npersonally connect with place by creating performances  through  mindsets  where  consumer  and\nproduct unite. In recognising and staging experiences, producers  enter  a  process  of  repackaging\nplace and (re)presenting unique  combinations  of  product  characteristics  (Morgan  &  Pritchard,\n1998) and create value through emotion and memory in accordance with dominant discourse  in  a\ncontrolled environment. Thirdly, \u2018brand  imagery\u2019  (Gold  &  Gold,  1995,  Goddard,  1990)  fuels\nmass  customisation  by  highlighting  dominant  discourse  and  creating  \u2018visual   anthropologies\u2019\n(Krauss, 1982) of  place.  However,  once  affinities  are  established,  a  multiplicity  of  meanings\nemerges and encourages individualism  that  enriches  experience  through  engagement  with  and\nimmersion  in  the  image.  Fourthly,  places  are  re-packaged  and  consumers  are   offered   new\nexperiences  that  stimulate  new  thoughts  but  continue  to  reassure  and   support   the   original\nframework   within   which   consumers   are    comfortable.    Finally,    through    transformation,\nenworldment is achieved. Images of place become  more  than  memories  as  consumers  embrace\nand become the product. They are fully engaged, embodied and re-position themselves within  the\nideological structures of the image as they accommodate place into their being and holiday in their\nminds.\nThis productive nature of image construction generates debate about the extent to which brochures\nare infused with exaggerated mediated discourse that encourages fiction over  fact.  Some  believe\nbrochures are grounded in imagination and myth (Saarinen, 1998), or are  \u2018trite  illusion\u2019  (Sontag,\n1979). Others, like Dann  (1993)  accept  the  role  of  mythical  structures  and  acknowledge  that\nbrochure construction requires  the  \u2018bliss  formula  of  Eden  images\u2019  as  images  are  often  more\nimportant than reality itself. Brochures hold dreams and provide access to those  dreams  (Reimer,\n1998). They are fantasy  and  reality  as  images  offer  accurate,  yet  sanitised  representations  of\nmaterial landscapes. The  image  construction  process  therefore  focuses  as  much  on  dominant\ndiscourse and producer (re)interpretation as material landscapes  and  consumer  interpretation,  as\nconsumers enjoy freedom of interpretation infused with frameworks of  pre-determined  discourse\nthat guide their understandings.\nThe  Processes  and  Practices  of   Mediation   in   the   Discourse   of\nBrochure Images\nWhilst the spaces of marketing, photography  and  design  at  first  appear  to  seamlessly  produce\nScotland\u2019s image, whilst interplay between spaces exists, fundamental  differences  exist  between\nagents  that  generates  numerous  individual  knowledge  contributions.   This   section   therefore\nhighlights the  complex  multidimensional  nature  of  image  construction  through  interplay  and\ndifference both between and within these spaces. Image construction is  therefore  established  not\nas  a  linear  sequence  of  events,  but  a  complex   chain   of   power\/knowledge   spaces   in   the\ninterpretation and (re)interpretation of place.\nTo ensure a thorough account of the image construction process and  the  identification  of  all  the\nmain areas of interplay and difference, interviews  were  conducted  with  marketing  managers  in\ncharge of both UK and overseas brochure production. An interview was conducted  with  the  sole\nSTB staff photographer. However, several interviews with freelance photographers who have  had\ntheir work used by or have been contracted by STB were conducted. This allowed a deeper insight\nto the technical skills  and  knowledges  of  photographers  and  their  role  in  image  construction\npower relations. Finally, the designers from the two design companies contracted to  work  on  the\ncurrent UK and overseas brochures were interviewed, thus ensuring all personnel involved  in  the\nthree mediating spaces of image construction were accessed.\nMarketing: The Driving Force of Mediation in Tourism Discourse\nSTB plays a key role in defining Scottish heritage and culture and promoting  Scotland\u2019s  identity.\nHowever, as Morgan & Pritchard (1998)  realise,  image  construction  never  starts  with  a  blank\ncanvas, but builds upon the culmination of historical, social, economic and political processes. For\nScotland, a distinct history of tartantry has emerged through historical peaks of Robert  the  Bruce,\nWilliam Wallace, Bannockburn, Mary Queen of Scots, Bonnie Prince Charlie, the  clearances,  Sir\nWalter Scott and  Queen  Victoria,  and  films  such  as  Brigadoon  and  Braveheart  that  generate\nfragmented masculine narratives  of  romance  and  mysticism  through  remoteness,  mountainous\nmisty landscapes and working  the  land  (McCrone,  2001).  The  result  is  arguably  the  ultimate\nsuccess in branding as Scotland exists as an individual on the  world  tourist  stage  (Butler,  1998)\nand has emerged as a set of exceptionally distinct place representations that inevitably fuel and are\nfuelled  by  tourism.  Some  refer  to  the  \u201ctartan  monster\u201d  (Nairn,  1977),  or   \u201cshortbread   tin\nimage\u201d (Gold & Gold, 1995) as stereotypical signs of tartan, kilts, pipers, highland dancers, misty\nlandscapes, castles and lochs that dominate the single image of Scotland and materialise a  fantasy\nthat is ingrained in deep ideological interpretations (McCrone, 2001). Despite  criticism  as  garish\nsigns embodied through  tourist  knick-knack,  the  success  of  \u2018Scotland  The  Brand\u2019  (McCrone,\n2001) cannot be denied and continues to underpin  contemporary  promotional  activities.  Indeed,\nnow all you have to do is flash a bit of tartan, a sprig of heather, a piper, a loch, a castle or a bottle\nof whisky and it shouts out Scotland.\nDespite these experiences already being recognised,  it  is  not  enough  to  randomly  put  existing\nsigns together. Rather, image construction generates a complex process of packaging Scotland and\ncreating  a  stage  upon  which   Scotland   can   be   enacted   to   meet   ever-changing   consumer\nperceptions.  In  researching,  establishing,  and  addressing  these  demands,  the  first,  and   most\npowerful, space  of  discourse  mediation  is  marketing  managers  as  they  become  the  voice  of\nconsumers and construct a knowledge-base of consumer preconceptions of Scotland that  provides\na foundation upon which  existing  discourses  are  rejuvenated  and  new  discourses  are  created,\ncontested or confirmed. Discourses are also set according to the positionality of the general tourist\nas selected features of a destination are positioned to  correspond  with  the  characteristics  of  the\ntarget audience (Dann, 1993). This generally appears to  be  predominantly  white,  western,  male\nand heterosexual (Richter, 1995,  cit.  Morgan  &  Pritchard,  1998),  and  in  the  specific  case  of\nScotland, between 35-40 years old, thus creating ways of seeing that are  filtered  through  gender,\nage, social class and ethnicity to create a dominant perspective on place according to the model  of\nan average tourist. It is also important to realise that such views are subliminally reinforced by the\ncomplex positioning of those involved in marketing, for irrelevant  of  gender,  age  and  ethnicity,\ndiscourses continue to be built on foundations of historical  masculine  narratives  which  are  then\npresented via fundamentally masculine power relations in a  western  society.  However,  as  Rose\n(1993, cit. Morgan & Pritchard, 1998: 170) such masculine direction does  by  no  means  imply  a\n\u201cconscious  conspiracy,  but  rather  a  complex   series   of   discursive   positions,   relations   and\npractices\u201d. Whilst the intricacies of such debates are outside the scope of this paper, it is important\nto acknowledge their importance as discourse intersects identities  to  create  powerful  voices  and\ndominant interpretations of place (Morgan & Pritchard, 1998). The responsibility of disseminating\nresultant discourse to other agents involved  in  image  construction  lies  directly  with  marketing\nmanagers. It is therefore vital marketing mangers achieve a comprehensive understanding of  such\nperceptions.  However,  in  order  to   research   consumer   perception   and   establish   discourse,\nmarketing managers rely on the knowledge of several external agents.\nFirstly, consumers are not powerless, for they are fundamentally linked to (Williamson, 1978) and\ndirectly influence the  market  research  process  (Morgan  &  Pritchard,  1998).  In  order  to  gain\nunderstandings of their ever-changing perceptions  and  engage  in  tactical  promotion,  marketing\nmanagers develop consumer profiles using highly targeted and profiled databases constructed over\nyears of market  research;  this  establishes  a  clear  focus  on  market  likes  and  dislikes.  Whilst\nresearch is ad hoc,  direct  consumer  information  informs  marketing  personnel  of  the  direction\nrequired for current campaigns. Marketing mangers are continually \u2018drip fed\u2019  consumer  feedback\non brochures, and,  despite  being  dismissed  as  over-used,  research  indicates  Scotland\u2019s  tartan\nimage  remains  strong  in  overseas  consumer  perceptions.  Consequently,  collective  ideologies\ncontinually emphasise established clich\u00e9s of tartan, kilts, mountains, lochs and castles that  adhere\nto historical discourses, commodity values and traditions of  Scotland  as  hospitable  and  friendly\nwith dramatic landscapes and space to breath and relax.  Additionally,  marketing  managers  draw\ndirectly upon consumer knowledge through consumer perception and visitor  satisfaction  surveys.\nMarketing personnel therefore maximise  positive  elements  whilst  rectifying  and  re-positioning\nnegative perceptions.\nSecondly, marketing personnel outsource work to  independent  research  agencies  located  in  the\nprime  markets  of  France,  Germany  and  the  USA  to  establish  the  individual  perceptions   of\nScotland held by each of these countries. Accessing new knowledges highlights subtle differences\nin national perceptions. For example, the French market emphasises Scotland\u2019s  dramatic  scenery\nand distinctive heritage, culture, clan histories and tradition with \u2018romantic notions of mystery and\nlegend\u2019 (STB, 1999a), whilst  Germans  emphasis  relaxing  in  the  clean,  isolated  wilderness  of\nScotlands dramatic, awe-inspiring, \u2018otherworldly\u2019 landscapes, with people that exude warmth  and\nfriendliness (STB, 1999b), and the American market is fascinated by Scottish history and tradition\nand strikes an affinity with  Scotland  through  genealogical  links  (STB,  1999b)  and  dreams  of\nmystery  and  magical  enchantment  amidst  heather,  mountains  and  lochs  (CLK,  1998).   Such\ninsights generate nuanced knowledges that are incorporated into  the  general  overseas  discourse,\nenabling marketing managers to \u2018audience\u2019 (Rose, 2001) general images  according  to  individual\nmarket preconceptions. \nThirdly, knowledge from independent tourist boards of Scotland  enables  marketing  managers  to\nhighlight the main strengths of each area and present them together to  achieve  a  stronger  overall\nimpression of each region of Scotland. Each independent office  presents  their  top  five  strengths\nand attractions, thus ensuring marketing managers have their \u2018finger on the  pulse\u2019  and  present  a\nfresh but accurate image of Scotland  in  accordance  with  new  developments  in  each  region  of\nScotland.\nMarketing  mangers  face  continual  pressure  to  accommodate  new  perceptions  and   changing\nfashions in consumer taste into the existing place  image.  Accommodation  inevitably  leads  to  a\nrepackaging of Scotland that subtly alters existing discourses,  commodity  values  and  traditions.\nConsequently, image construction becomes a continual  battle  between  finding  \u2018new  takes\u2019  that\ncreate fresh, innovative views of Scotland that complement existing discourses,  whilst  accurately\nrepresenting Scotland. Therefore, whilst the key iconic attributes of lochs,  mountains  and  castles\nremain at the forefront of landscape mediation, they are never static, but are immersed in an  ever-\nchanging discourse that alters the ways in which they are read by consumers.\nWhilst the foundations of the Scottish experience have already been recognised through  historical\ncommodity values and traditions, the professional skills and knowledges  of  marketing  managers\nas creative advertisers with the ability to generate stimulating, new visions of  place  that  combine\nestablished icons  alongside  contemporary  discourse  are  fundamental  to  the  creation  of  \u2018new\nexperiences\u2019 (Pine & Gilmore, 1999). The discourse for UK consumers exemplifies this as market\nresearch identified the need to accommodate progressive views  of  Scotland  in  the  discourse  of\ndomestic market and loosen the historical trappings  of  \u2018haggis  imagery\u2019  in  previous  marketing\ncampaigns. Whilst traditional key iconic signs of Scotland are acknowledged, marketing managers\nengage in  re-packaging  Scotland  by  developing  new  discourses  that  deviate  from  Scotland\u2019s\ntraditional tartantry to focus on its alternative spiritual  discourse  of  scenery,  light,  mystery  and\nspace.  By  combining  research  knowledges   and   professional   creative   knowing   and   ideas,\nmarketing managers  mediate  discourse  to  build  upon  consumers\u2019  \u2018need  state\u2019  and  reposition\nScotland as a \u2018stress-buster\u2019 for overworked consumers who seek reconnection and perspective  in\ntheir lives.  Marketed  as  \u2018yours  to  discover\u2019,  the  vast,  unspoilt  landscapes  of  Scotland  invite\nconsumers to explore their own country, whilst notions of \u2018it  stays  with  you\u2019  imply  the  relaxed\nexperiences of Scotland will remain with you when you return home.\nDespite demands of re-packaging, brochures must present experiences available to  consumers  on\narrival in Scotland. Although  images  create  \u2018Scotland\u2019s  Storyboard\u2019,  \u2018stories\u2019  cannot  generate\nfalse  representations.  However,  image  construction  is  a  highly  selective  process  and,  whilst\nimagery builds upon dominant narratives, consumers  are  presented  with  selective,  but  realistic\nrepresentations of Scotland  in  accordance  with  what  STB  want  consumers  to  see.  Marketing\nmanagers directly influence what consumers do and do not see and focus on Scotland\u2019s  strengths,\nmediating landscapes in ways which eliminate  undesirable  elements  within  them.  In  sustaining\npreferred  readings  of  place  (Burgess,  1980),  image   construction   offers   consumers   already\nimagined spaces that subsequently \u2018become what they want to see\u2019, as  long  as  it  fits  within  the\nremit of mediated discourse.\nMarketing  managers  therefore  do  not  act  independently,  but  rely  upon  the   knowledge   and\nexpertise of several external agents: overseas research  agencies,  local  tourist  boards,  and  direct\nand indirect communication with consumers to establish the  foundations  upon  which  discourses\nare  constructed.  However,  a  strong  element  of  professional  intuition,   expert   knowledge   of\nScotland and experience of \u2018knowing\u2019 what elements of the country are attractive and appealing to\nconsumers,  is  also  highly  influential.  Utilising  this  combination   of   knowledges,   marketing\nmanagers compose detailed strategies which  outline  the  key  discursive  ideologies  upon  which\nbrochures and their images  are  constructed  and  become  the  foundation  stone  upon  which  all\ndecisions are made. The aim  is  to  fulfil  the  brief.  Nevertheless,  whilst  the  brief  becomes  the\npowerful drive behind image construction, there  are  vital  elements  of  this  process  outwith  the\nscope of marketing power.\nPhotography: Capturing Landscapes and Fulfilling Discourse Needs\nThe role of  photographers  in  image  construction  cannot  be  underestimated,  for  without  their\ntalents there would be no images to present to tourists, and brochures, by their very nature, rely on\nimages to  sell  destinations.  STB  employs  one  staff  photographer  and  utilises  the  images  of\nfreelance  photographers  who  supply  external  image  libraries  or  from  which  STB   outsource\nimagery directly. Freelance photographers regard themselves as \u2018free spirits\u2019; shooting  only  what\nthey want to avoid falling victim to consumer demands. Whilst the most  apparent  power  relation\nin freelance relationships is whether or not a photograph fulfils the requirements of the  marketing\nbrief, freelance photographers, unlike the staff  photographer,  are  not  bound  to  fulfil  marketing\ndemands. Nevertheless, a number of general professional photographic  skills  and  expertise  exist\nthat deepen the complexities of this relationship as all photographers engage in directly  mediating\nof landscapes  through  photographic  practice,  creating  a  second  space  of  mediation  in  image\nconstruction.\nNevertheless, marketing mangers, as clients, communicate discourse requirements directly to their\nstaff photographer. Fundamentally, the STB staff photographer has to seek out  images  that  fulfil\nthis  brief.  Therefore,  as  experiences   are   already   recognised   by   marketing,   photographers\ncontribute to staging the  experience  in  providing  photographic  backdrops  that  incorporate  the\nmediated discourse outlined by marketing personnel, in order  to  create  moods  and  atmospheres\nthat can transform consumers. Strong awareness of  mediated  discourse  is  reflected  in  the  staff\nphotographer\u2019s work, as he revealed: \u2018I like to show an element  of  real  life,  but  it\u2019s  a  sanitised\nversion\u2019. Nevertheless, honesty is essential and photographs must present something tourists  may\nactually see on their arrival in Scotland. It is vital that Scotland is  flattered  and  seen  in  its  \u2018best\nlight\u2019 with key iconic elements of landscape included to ensure  marketing  demands  are  fulfilled\nand images selected.\nKey elements of Scotland  are  reinforced  through  the  continual  re-use  of  Scotland\u2019s  enduring\n\u2018classic views\u2019 of Glencoe, Eilean Donan Castle, The Cuillins  and  Edinburgh  from  Calton  Hill.\nClassics offer consumers the unique brand attributes of Scotland\u2019s castles, mountains and  lochs  -\nscenery that  fulfils  consumer  demands  acknowledged  by  mediated  discourse.  The  STB  staff\nphotographer produces familiar, attractive landscapes because, by communicating with  marketing\nmanagers, he is aware \u2018people\u2026always relate to and request classic views\u2019.  Following  marketing\ndemands, photographers gild the look of Scotland  by  selecting  \u2018classic  locations  and  attractive\nlandscapes  to  convey  atmospheres  and  values  that  reinforce  brand  values  and   embody   the\natmospheres, moods and unique attributes of Scotland outlined in marketing discourse.\nWhilst photographers are bound  to  fulfil  the  requirements  of  a  brief,  difference  arises  in  the\nprofessional skills, knowledge and artistic interpretation of place. Indeed, once discourse has been\nestablished and communicated by marketing managers, the initial staging  of  landscapes  depends\nupon  photographers\u2019  understanding  and  interpretation  of  discursive  aims.   Whilst   marketing\nmanagers hold knowledge of the elements required to  fulfil  discursive  aims,  and  can  recognise\nsuccessful images during final selection, it is photographers who have the knowledge and skills  to\nseek out these landscapes and capture them photographically in ways  that  mesmerise  consumers\nand facilitate their transformation into the image. All photographers emphasised a subliminal sixth-\nsense \u2018knowing\u2019 of what makes a successful image. Skills,  knowledge  and  artistic  interpretation\ndevelop through experience and are applied intuitively and photographers  instinctively  recognise\nwhen elements of images fit together in the right place at the  right  time.  Photographic  technique\nbecomes \u2018second-nature\u2019 as photographers \u2018grab  rectangles\u2019  and  practise  \u2018eye-exercise\u2019,  in  the\nsearch for  the  \u2018leap\u2019  where  image  elements  combine  in  an  indescribable  energy  which  goes\n\u2018beyond words and  communicat(es)  to  consumers  in  another  sense  altogether\u2019.  Photographers\ncapture landscapes as landscapes capture their attention. Using their  skills,  photographers  secure\nlandscapes that fulfil marketing requirements and in turn, capture tourists\u2019 attention.\nPhotographers realise brochure images focus on more than Scotland\u2019s  sheer  beauty  and  need  to\naccommodate familiar, enticing elements of landscapes, something more than a view, but  a  point\nof interest, or magical ingredient,  to  capture,  hold  and  transport  consumers.  The  first  magical\ningredient is water. Many photographers were passionate about the inclusion of water in images of\nScotland, noting: \u2018all the best images include water\u2019. In  Figure  1,  the  water  becomes  a  sign  of\nScotland\u2019s romance, mystery and \u2018otherworldliness\u2019. Water, as  a  sign,  focuses  on  the  preferred\nreadings of Scotland as outlined by marketing personnel. By \u2018audiencing the image\u2019 (Rose,  2001)\nand focusing on the possible ways consumers  may  interpret  images,  photographers  capture  the\nsign in a way that shifts consumer needs onto the content of the image. The stillness  of  the  water\nconnotes a peaceful, tranquil  location,  promising  an  escape  from  the  bustle  of  everyday  life.\nNotions of calmness are intensified by the perfect reflections of the hills and the castle, suggesting\ngood  weather,  minimising  negative  representations  of  Scotland  as  rainy,  and  offering   pure,\nuncontaminated air where you can fill your lungs and breathe easily  as  your  troubles  drift  away\ninto the depths of the loch and relaxation washes over you. The reflection, as a sign, also  suggests\nsymmetry, balance and harmony, fulfilling notions of Scotland as a  place  to  reconnect  and  find\nyourself, whilst the slight haziness of the reflection stimulates notions of the past merging with the\npresent. Finally, the reflection of the castle generates mystery of Scotland\u2019s historic past, of battles\nand heroic triumphs and defeats, signifying a life that once was, a life apart from the present,  thus\nfuelling notions of Scotland as a haven to escape to. Signs therefore create difference and are  read\nboth in terms of what they are and what they  are  not  (Rose,  2001,  Markwick,  2001).  Signs  do\nmany things at once, and are constructed and consumed through the idea of creation (Rose, 2001),\nthus perfectly adhering to the idea of mass customisation and  individualism  that  fuels  consumer\ntransformation (Pine & Gilmore, 1999), as  photographers  seek  to  saturate  their  content  with  a\nmultitude of possible interpretations according  to  the  codes  outlined  by  marketing,  consumers\nseek to interpret and use image content to fulfil their individual needs and desires.\nFigure 1: Kichurn Castle, Loch Awe\nSecondly, the interplay of light on landscapes intensifies the magical qualities of images.  Light  is\ndramatic and  constantly  changing,  enabling  photographers  to  create  moods,  atmospheres  and\nsensations that hold surreal  qualities  and  suggests  otherworldliness  and  the  removal  from  the\neveryday. Such interplay essentialises an area and creates  a  magical  invitation  to  consumers  to\nbecome immersed in an image. Expert  knowledge  allows  photographers  to  optimise  dawn  and\ndusk when light is best, as it is warming up,  or  cooling  down,  playing  over  the  landscape  and\ncreating longer shadows and softness that adds to the power images hold. Aware that  the  position\nof the sun drastically alters mood and  atmosphere  and  that  light  in  different  seasons  produces\ndifferent visual effects, photographers  further  mediate  landscapes  by  learning  and  anticipating\nconditions of particular locations and travelling only when conditions provide the set  suitable  for\nstaging the experience desired.\nThirdly, photographers emphasise  movement  as  a  technique  for  holding  consumers  attention,\nembodying them and evoking notions of \u2018being  there\u2019.  Photographers  utilise  their  photographic\nknowledge and expertise to  lengthen  exposures  and  produce  images  exhibiting  partial  clarity.\nBlurring image content  creates  greater  fluidity  within  images  whilst  ensuring  consumers  can\nidentify image content. Whilst blurring is not always appropriate,  movement  in  images  of  pubs\nand outdoor activities conveys Scotland as lively, friendly, adventurous or exciting (see Figure 2).\nAlternatively, introducing movement into water  creates  misty,  fluid  atmospheres  that  hold  \u2018an\nethereal quality\u2019. Diagonals and angles are used to focus attention on the centre of images, pulling\nconsumers into, and moving them around images, whilst breaking  horizons  with  graphic  shapes\ncreates fluidity and movement to entice a deeper  intensity  of  consumer  involvement  in  reading\nimages. Such movement highlights selectivity and photographic conformity to discourse demands,\nas images present Scotland as a lively, active destination, whilst maintaining  an  air  of  relaxation\nand spirituality.\nFigure 2: Lively Pub\nColour, the final  magic  ingredient,  brings  images  to  life  and  stirs  emotion  in  consumers  by\ncreating warmth and depth. Using experience and  knowledge,  photographers  seek  a  balance  of\ncolours, because different colours convey  different  moods  as  readers  associate  colours  to  past\nexperiences by utilising interpretative codes. Generally,  cold  colours  (e.g.  blue,  purple)  signify\nunattractive, cold images that portray negative representations  of  place.  Photographers  therefore\nrecognise that brochure images  rely  on  combinations  of  warm  colours  (e.g.  yellows,  oranges,\nbrowns and lush greens) to convey attractive, relaxing and appealing landscapes. Whilst  Scotland\nis predominantly blue and green, photographers use their knowledge of placing colours in  images\nto combine cold colours with warmer colours to add warmth  to  images,  evoking  emotions  of  a\ncalm and serene atmosphere.\nAlthough not recognised as a \u2018magical ingredient\u2019, people are vital to  brochure  imagery  for  they\ncreate scale (see figure 3) and reassure consumers that locations are  accessible,  quelling  fears  of\nisolation and facilitating  consumer  transformation  as  \u2018imagined  actors\u2019  in  a  scene.  Following\ndiscourse demands, people should be perceived as natural, happy  and  ideally,  unrecognisable  to\ncreate ambiguity that allows consumers to place themselves in images uninfluenced by the  person\nphotographed.  Where  recognisable,  people  should  average  35-40  to  minimise   negative   age\nperceptions and satisfy discursive ideological underpinnings that welcome all ages, not just young\nor old. People become signs of place through which consumers identify themselves in  a  desirable\nsituation However, people can  appear  \u2018staged\u2019  and  unnatural,  pointing  towards  horizons  with\nmaps in their hands, reducing \u2018timeless\u2019 qualities and fuelling kitsch interpretation. Photographers\nare therefore under pressure to meet ideological demands of gender, ethnicity and family status  in\norder for an image  to  be  well  received  by  marketing  managers  and  appealing  to  consumers.\nHowever, such positioning is generally mirrored by photographers themselves  who  largely  equal\ntourist as white, male and western, thus by their very being reinforcing this viewpoint from  which\nScotland  is  portrayed.  As  Morgan   &   Pritchard   (2000)   realise:   \u201cthe   cultural   significance\nof...imagery is far wider than merely the impact of seeing a photograph in a brochure\u201d.\nFigure 3: People overlooking the Old Man of Hoy\nCharacters of Scotland dressed in appropriate clothing and placed in an appropriate  setting  act  as\nsigns that encourage consumers to imaginatively enact the lives of  those  pictured.  Using  Dyer\u2019s\n(1987, cit. Rose, 2001) checklist  for  exploring  signs,  figure  four  serves  to  fulfil  the  idealised\nmasculine ideological interpretations of Scotland as outlined  in  marketing  discourse.  He  stands\nfacing the camera in a relaxed stance, with a large smile and his hands clearly  visible,  suggesting\nopenness, friendliness, honesty and a cheery, hospitable nature,  thereby  reinforcing  ideas  that  a\nwarm, friendly welcome awaits  consumers  in  Scotland.  His  grey  hair  and  mature  appearance\nconvey  wisdom,  dependability  and  kindness,   coupled   with   strength   and   independence;   a\ngrandfather  figure.  The  staff  and  the  wall  upon  which  he  leans   convey   support   and   feed\nideological ideals of Scots as welcoming, giving and supportive to others.  Furthermore,  the  staff\nsignifies life on the land, fuelling romantic,  masculine  ideological  interpretations  of  life  in  the\nremote mountains, a primitive existence distinct from urban dwelling and the stresses of urban life\nof the consumer. Such interpretations are further enhanced by the settings. He stands beside  a  dry\nstone wall, a sign of  past  traditions  and  harmony  with  nature.  The  mountains  emphasise  this\nremoteness  and  add  drama  and  mystery  to  the  experience  being  staged.  His  house  conveys\ndifference between \u2018Scottish\u2019 lifestyles and  those  of  the  consumer,  its  small  size  emphasising\nquaintness,  whilst  accentuating  the  vastness  of   the   mystical   landscape,   the   isolation   and\nremoteness both from civilisation and the present life  experiences  of  the  consumer.  Its  position\nwithin the landscape signifies harmony and balance with nature both in general and within the life\nof  the  crofter.  Finally,  the  river  emphasises  notions  of  tranquillity  and  peacefulness  in  life.\nCharacter images therefore accentuate difference as photographers  stage  and  (re)present  images\nthat present preferred readings of place, conform to consumer expectation, and stimulate more  in-\ndepth ideological interpretations of place  that  facilitate  consumers\u2019  imaginative  discovery  of  a\ndestination.\nPhotographic knowledge of composition is  vital  in  photography  and  consumer  transformation.\nPhotographic interpretation adopts an instinctive layering process through foreground,  midground\nto background and logical pathways  of  working  left  to  right  to  provide  balanced,  stimulating\ncontent. Foregrounds are darker than  backgrounds  to  create  depth  and  distance  of  perception,\nwhilst tones are buffers with light tones leading  readers\u2019  eyes  into  the  image  and  darker  tones\nstopping them from leaving. Foregrounds offer immediate access to place as consumers  feel  they\ncan touch the grass in front of them and soak up the atmosphere through visual stimulation, whilst\nhorizons  convey  endless  landscapes  into  which  consumers  can  sink.  Images  become  deeply\nspectator-orientated as photographers encourage consumers to spend  time  in  an  image,  creating\nspace for the animation of emotion and ideology.\nFigure 4: Crofter on Skye\nUsing  these  skills  and  knowledges,  the  staff  photographer  produces  a  collection  of  images,\nincluding some more innovative pieces, that, upon his return, he  presents  in  a  meeting  between\nhimself and the marketing manager. The staff photographer initially selects  images  to  present  to\nmarketing managers based on photographic knowledge of content and quality, but  also  according\nto his interpretation of marketing discourse. Back in the office,  once  selections  have  been  made\nfrom location shots, a meeting is held between  the  staff  photographer  and  marketing  personnel\nwhere the final images are debated over by both sides. Such meetings generate  interplay  between\nboth parties as they present their ideas  and  opinions  in  accordance  with  their  knowledges  and\nareas of expertise. Successful images are catalogued into the  STB  image  library.  In  addition  to\nbuilding an image library, such situations offer space for the photographer to actively facilitate the\ndevelopment of Scotland\u2019s image by presenting new photographic  interpretations  and  proposing\nfresh ideas  for  photographic  content,  thus  facilitating  marketing  personnel  in  their  continual\nsearch for fresh \u2018takes\u2019 on the landscapes of Scotland, in addition to the  classic  shots  they  know\nwill satisfy discourse demands. Nevertheless, marketing managers must ensure images fulfil  their\ndemands and subsequently make suggestions for new, more specific images in order that the  brief\nbe fulfilled!\nDifferences therefore exist between spaces of marketing and photography in  terms  of  knowledge\nand expertise, and between freelance photographers and  the  STB  staff  photographer.  Spaces  of\ninfluence and power in photographic mediation result through expert knowledges of and  skills  in\nphotographic practice, shown through such practices as the incorporation  of  magical  ingredients,\nframing, lighting, and other  compositional  techniques.  It  is  photographers  who  fundamentally\ncapture  the  landscapes  that  serve  to  fulfil  discourse   demands,   and,   whilst   the   STB   staff\nphotographer is duty bound to fulfil marketing manager demands, space  exists  to  innovate  takes\non Scotland\u2019s landscape. Such innovation and generation  of  new  photographic  ways  of  seeing,\nprovides the opportunity for photographers to contribute to the (re)packaging of Scotland  and  the\ndevelopment of discursive interpretations of place that  build  upon  existing  historical  discourse.\nDespite interplay between the staff photographer and marketing managers in selecting  images  for\nthe STB image library, the ultimate authority lies  with  marketing  to  determine  whether  images\ncommunicate discourse and it is to these decisions that the staff photographer is ultimately bound.\nDesign: Presenting a Mediated Way of Seeing on Brochure Pages\nDesigners  contracted   into   brochure   construction   engage   in   an   extremely   close   working\nrelationship with STB, and it is in this final  space  of  mediation  where  deadlines  are  tight,  and\npressure is high, that interplay and difference between creative   powers  is  most  pronounced  [1].\nDuring the design phase, the importance of adhering strictly to the brief intensifies  as  the  people\nwho ultimately commission an advert or image design cannot  be  ignored  (Morgan  &  Pritchard,\n1998)! Initially, designers are presented with a detailed  design  brief  that  provides  \u2018pretty  tight\u2019\nguidelines within which to work. Marketing managers distribute the  brief  to  a  small  number  of\nselected designers and invite ideas for tender. Designers present  one  to  two  concepts,  a  sample\nlayout and costs. Marketing managers then  discuss  the  options  and,  based  upon  \u2018gut  instinct\u2019,\npricing and  knowing  what  fulfils  consumer  expectations,  a  design  company  is  contracted  to\nconstruct  the  final  brochure.  Whilst  decisions  are  usually   unanimous,   in   situations   where\nagreement cannot be met, the power of final decision lies with the marketing manager.\nChosen designs provide only the starting point from which the final designs evolve. Once a design\nis  selected,  both  designer  and  marketing  manager  enter  into  an  intense  relationship  that   is\ninfluenced not only by the expertise and knowledge of the designer, but is  highly  tailored  by  the\ndemands  and  knowledges  of  the  marketing  manager  and   the   design   brief.   Designers   and\nmarketing managers  enter  into  a  highly  engaging  two-way  communicative  relationship,  each\ncontributing their expertise, knowledge and  professional  skills  to  the  design,  creating  a  strong\ninterplay  between  creative  agents.  Throughout  the  design  process,  designers   and   marketing\nmanagers meet to ensure requirements of the brief are being met effectively. Marketing  managers\nbring  knowledge  of  past  brochure  successes  and  failures  and  their   in-depth   knowledge   of\nconsumer perception and demand to reason and justify why design elements may  or  may  not  be\nsuccessful. In this sense, through their knowledge and expertise, always with the  ultimate  aim  of\nfulfilling the design brief to its full, marketing managers facilitate designers in developing a  \u2018feel\u2019\nfor and understanding discourse requirements.\nDuring the construction of the initial brochure design, designers are free to select the  images  they\ndeem  appropriate.  Such  selection  provides  opportunity  for  mediation   and   (re)packaging   of\nScotland as designers selectively present Scotland\u2019s landscapes to fulfil  discourse  demands,  thus\napplying  individual  expertise,  knowledge  and  interpretation,  whilst  simultaneously  satisfying\nclient demands. However, when no suitable images are available, designers engage in consultation\nwith and guidance from marketing  managers  and  the  staff  photographer  and  in  order  to  their\nknowledge  of  the  STB  image  bank  and  to  locate  images.  Where  no  images  can  be  found,\ndesigners  outsource  images  from  external  image  libraries,  providing  further  opportunity   for\nmediation as a secondary brief is imposed by designers upon image libraries. Allocation of images\nbegins early in brochures  design,  with  thought  to  current  brochure  images  occurring  early  in\ndesign stages to ensure that where no suitable images are found, designers have the time to request\nshots in the forthcoming year. In doing so, spaces  arise  for  designers  to  request  specific  image\ncontent,  generating  secondary  briefs  that,  with  authorisation  from  marketing   managers,   are\nfulfilled.\nNevertheless, the front cover is the main visual that draws  consumers  attention  and  as  such,  its\nconstruction and  selection  involves  interplay  between  the  knowledges  and  experiences  of  all\ncontributors. As ever, the brief provides the foundations,  outlining  statutory  inclusions  and  key\nideas to be conveyed. Where a suitable image cannot be located for use on the  front  cover,  briefs\nare compiled upon which extremely focused  photo-shoots  result.  These  exhibit  direct  interplay\nbetween photographer and marketing manager as both go on location. Opportunity  arises  for  the\nphotographer and designer to instil expertise and interpretation into the  final  outcome.  However,\nsuch situations also  allow  the  marketing  manager  to  directly  choreograph  the  end  result  and\nensure a perfect result. When selecting the right image, each person brings justifications according\nto marketing, photographic or design interpretation and expertise. However, whilst an  image  may\nexhibit perfect photographic or design elements, it is vital marketing  managers  are  satisfied  that\ndiscourses are conveyed.\nOnce initial drafts of the brochure are complete, meetings are held whereby the  whole  production\nteam collaborate and discuss the final  selection  of  images.  Drawing  upon  individual  expertise,\nskills and knowledge of designers, marketing personnel and the STB  photographer,  draft  images\nare discussed, and, if an image is deemed inappropriate by a  team  member,  professional  reasons\nare given  and,  if  justified,  another  image  is  found.  The  final  choice  of  images  represents  a\nconsensus of production team opinion,  presenting  images  that  fulfil  marketing  discourse  most\neffectively. However, where consensus cannot be  established,  the  marketing  manager  has  final\nauthority over what is included, and excluded from the final brochure.\nWhilst such interplays of creative power are vital in the design space,  the  influence  of  designers\ncomes  through  the  design  of  brochure  layouts.  Designers  utilise  their  expertise,   skills   and\nknowledge to convey discourse through  suggestive  imagery  and  produce  a  stunning,  inspiring\nbrochure design that directly addresses the consumers \u2018need state\u2019 as outlined in the  design  brief.\nDesigners are highly skilled in creating memorable experiences, and it is through the repository of\nknowledge  and  experience  that  power   is   achieved   (Morgan   &   Pritchard,   1998).   Despite\nrestrictions of the brief in terms of discourse and statutory elements to be included (e.g. maps,  A4\nsize), the  influence  of  designers  arises  as  they  \u2018switch  themselves  on\u2019  and  draw  upon  their\nknowledge and expertise of design practices to transform consumers. It is through this  process  of\n\u2018switching on\u2019 that the positionality of the designer comes into play. Akin to marketing  managers\nand photographers, designers, through their very being as predominantly white, male and western,\nsubliminally reinforce the ideological positioning of tourists  according  to  gender,  age,  ethnicity\nand social class. However, irrelevant of positioning, designers contribute to  the  (re)packaging  of\nScotland as they bring a wealth of specialist knowledge inaccessible  to  marketing  managers  and\nphotographers that empower them in the image construction process.\nFirstly, designers adopt grid-like approaches and systematically establish space on  each  page  for\nimages, texts and borders  that  form  the  foundations  of  an  accessible,  comfortable  and  easily\nreadable brochure that fits consumer habits of flicking through brochures rather than reading from\ncover to cover. Designers mediate the reading of Scotland\u2019s landscapes as they position images  to\ngrab attention and lure consumers into the brochure  content  through  \u2018snippets  of\u2026information\u2019.\nAs  one  designer  realised:  \u2018it\u2019s\u2026about  putting  something   on   the   right   page   at   the   right\ntime...something   that\u2026catch(es)   (consumers\u2019)   attention\u2026makes    them    think    \u2018oh,    that\u2019s\ninteresting\u2019\u2019. Designers\u2019 subliminal awareness of aesthetics  creates  \u2018dippability\u2019,  movement  and\nfluidity within brochure pages, ensuring consumers attention is held within pages that are  easy  to\nnavigate and understand. Dippability also arises through balance and avoiding repetition in  image\npresentation.  Designers  directly  influence  the  ways  consumers   see   Scotland   by   producing\nbrochure layouts that allow an effortless reading of Scotland\u2019s landscapes in  a  positive,  desirable\nlight. Whether consumers read the brochure from cover to cover, or just dip in and out, the  design\nof the brochure ensures the mediated discourse presented by marketing  personnel  will  be  at  the\nforefront of consumer interpretation.\nSecondly, utilising artistic interpretation, expertise and knowledge of what works,  designers  vary\nimage sizes to increase the readability and accessibility  of  brochures.  Large,  panoramic  images\nplaced at the start of regional sections provide sweeping statements  of  geographical  regions  that\nare then enhanced throughout a regional spread. Panoramics hold iconic status and  are  positioned\nas high impact images to influence the first-impressions established in  consumers\u2019  minds.  These\nimages yield immense power and breathe  life  into  brochures.  Designers  present  intense  visual\nimpacts,  mediating  the  way  Scotland  is  viewed  by  stunning  consumers   with   awe-inspiring\nlandscapes. However, artistic and aesthetic  intuition  warns  that  a  brochure  full  of  panoramics\nwould become stale, rather than  fluid  and  appealing.  Accessibility  is  increased  by  iconisising\nsmaller images to make icons from existing icons of Scotland, breaking solid  rectangular  barriers\nof standard photography and  using  icons  to  bring  life,  vibrancy  and  vitality  to  brochures.  In\naddition to acting as buffers at page corners and thereby  holding  consumers  attention  inside  the\nbrochure pages, icons offer quirky insights into place, instilling warmth, feeling and  humour  into\nbrochures that represents Scotland as a whole.\nExpertise  and  knowing  what  works  in  design  therefore  enables   designers   to   benefit   from\npresenting a  selection  of  image  sizes  within  brochure  spreads.  Bigger  images  are  positioned\nalongside smaller images, enhancing movement around the spread as  consumers  are  encouraged\nto move onto adjoining images. Designers use images  as  bridges  to  ease  consumers  journeying\nthrough brochure pages, leading them by hand and eye  by  offering  something  new  to  see  each\npage turn.  However,  designers  warned  smaller  images  may  become  busy  and  unidentifiable,\nconfusing  consumers  rather  than  offering  additional   information,   thus   generating   negative\nreactions to Scotland.\nThirdly, as discussed in photographic practices, colour enables designers  to  convey  the  different\nmoods and atmospheres outlined in the brief.  In addition to the use of  colour  within  the  images\noutlined in the  previous  section  on  photography,  designers  also  highlighted  the  technique  of\ncolour  in  holding  images  and  spreads  together.  Providing  continuity,  designers  allocate  key\ncolours to be used in elements such as borders and maps. Colours provide a  means  of  cementing\nsections of information into an identifiable and logical order. Colours are  used  to  enhance  rather\nthan detract from the main image presented on the brochure page.  Free  to  use  any  colours  they\nchoose, designers expressed how selection was common sense; although common sense in  design\nis inevitably underpinned by artistic expertise and knowledge of design practice. Consequently,  it\nwould not be common sense to use luminous or intrusive,  unappealing  colours  that  deter  rather\nthan attract consumers.\nFinally, as with marketing managers and  photographers,  designers  continually  seek  to  produce\ninnovative   and   fresh   brochure   layouts   that   reflect   both    contemporary    and    traditional\ncharacteristics of Scotland. It is through  the  application  of  innovative  thinking  to  designs  that\ndesigners  are  able  to  contribute  to,  both  the  fulfilment  of  marketing  discourse  and   the   re-\npackaging and development of new discourses of Scotland. They seek to present  images  in  new,\nimaginative  ways  and  generate  innovative  material  from  that  which  is  \u2018old  hat\u2019.   Designers\nfacilitate development of discourse by  drawing  upon  their  knowledge  and  expertise  of  design\ntechniques to achieve new looks, refreshing and redirecting discursive  interpretations  of  existing\nimages of Scotland. They keep  images  fresh  by  altering  image  sizes:  reducing,  enlarging  and\ncropping images  to  disguise  those  published  in  previous  brochures.  Additionally  images  are\npresented  in  different  sequences  and  contexts  to  those  utilised  in  past  promotions.  Building\nknowledge of images that fit, designers allocate images and  present  them  in  ways  that,  ideally,\nhave never been seen before. Therefore, whilst bound by the brief and the  demands  of  marketing\nmanagers in  their  position  as  clients,  designers  contribute  to  (re)packaging  Scotland  through\nprofessional knowledge gained not only through interplay with marketing and  photographers,  but\nalso working between themselves and with previous clients.\nWhilst appearing to work as a collaborative production team, marketing personnel,  photographers\nand designers enter into a complex relationship that utilises the expertise, skills and knowledge  of\neach profession to ensure the brochure fulfils marketing discourse in  the  most  effective  manner.\nThrough the brief,  designers  are  continually  aware  of  the  needs,  expectations  and  desires  of\nconsumers,  and  seek  to  utilise  their  design  expertise  and  practices  to  absorb  and  transform\nconsumers into the final brochure. Indeed, the brief must be fulfilled and ultimate power lies  with\nmarketing as the  client,  and  marketing  managers  hold  the  final  word  on  image  presentation.\nHowever,  power  through  design  mediation  focuses  on  technical  expertise,  interpretation  and\nknowing what is aesthetically appealing in brochure layout. Designers not only present images  on\nbrochure pages, but stage the experience through which consumers see and absorb  image  content\nand  thus  understand  Scotland.  Like  photographers,  designers  do   not   control   or   determine\ndiscourse, but opportunities arise to influence ways of seeing and thinking about Scotland through\nthe application of design technique and expertise via manipulating the use of  colour,  image  size,\nbalance and ensuring readability, accessibility and familiarity  within  brochure  pages.  These  are\ninnovative ways of presenting place that convey  the  moods  and  emotions  that  fulfil  marketing\ndemands.\nConclusion\nImages are integral to the success of any tourist brochure as they offer not only a \u2018reality\u2019 of  what\nis available to tourists on arrival at a destination, but they  act  as  \u2018entrance  points\u2019  to  enworlded\nlandscapes through which ideological worlds  are  created.  By  focusing  on  \u2018you\u2019,  images  instil\nnotions of \u2018being there\u2019, encouraging  consumers  to  think  and  feel  beyond  the  visual  into  the\nenworlded depth of the image. However, despite such focus  on  the  \u2018tourist  as  end  user\u2019  of  the\nbrochure image, through the example of  STB,  this  paper  has  highlighted  the  key  elements  of\nimage  construction  that  result  in  this  final  space  of  touristic  consumption  and  rethinks   the\nprocesses  and  practices  involved  in  the  process  of  constructing  images  in  tourist  brochures.\nDismissing  ideas  of  a  largely  seamless  process,  a  set  of  complex  interactions  between   and\ndifferences  amongst  several  agents  involved  in  image   construction,   and   their   knowledges,\nexpertise and skills has been identified. Whilst paper limitations have  focused  discussion  on  the\ninterplays and differences between  three  spaces  of  constructing  discourse,  capturing  discourse\nphotographically and presenting discourse within brochure design, the aim  has  been  to  open  up\nthe  complexity  of  image  construction  and  identify  a  chain  of  creative  spaces  of   mediation\ninvolved in recognising, staging, mass customisation, re-packaging and transformation of touristic\nexperiences in image construction and the interplay and  difference  between  these  spaces,  rather\nthan creating a linear model of power relations.\nThe  first  main  space  has  been  outlined  as  marketing  and  the  role  of   marketing   managers.\nScotland\u2019s image has, over the centuries, developed  into  an  exceptionally  strong  brand  identity\nthat draws upon key historical commodity values and traditions. In order to  ensure  the  continued\nappreciation of such brand imagery, marketing managers  engage  in  the  process  of  constructing\ndetailed knowledge databases  of  consumer  perceptions  of  place.  Guided  by  Scotland\u2019s  brand\nimage that continues to attract attention  and  form  the  basis  of  marketing  discourse,  marketing\nmanagers research consumer perception directly from  consumers  themselves,  indirectly  through\noverseas research agencies, and they accumulate knowledge  of  emerging  attractions  from  local\ntourist boards. Subsequently, they are positioned to  engage  in  the  tactile  re-packaging  of  place\nthrough the construction of subtle change in place discourse. Marketing managers build upon  this\nagglomeration of knowledge by applying professional knowledge and  experience  of  Scotland  as\nplace with marketing practices to  creatively  mould  and  repackage  place  discourse  in  order  to\nappeal to continuing and changing tourist perceptions and to create new experiences. This creative\ndrive  in  discourse  development  creates  focused  communicative  discourses   that   outline   key\nideological messages to  be  conveyed  to  consumers  and  becomes  the  foundation  upon  which\nimages are taken and selected in subsequent spaces of mediation. It  is  vital  marketing  managers\ndisseminate their knowledge effectively because the brief becomes the drive behind the remainder\nof the image construction process.\nThe second main space  of  mediation  arises  through  the  act  of  photography  of  the  STB  staff\nphotographer and external freelance photographers. As freelance photographers are not  bound  by\ndiscourse demands, working instead for image libraries, STB are only able to select from  existing\nimages to fulfil their needs rather than influencing the act of  photography  directly.  Nevertheless,\nthe staff photographer is continually engaged with discourse developments  as  they  are  regularly\ncommunicated  to  him  by  marketing  managers  directly.  He  is  therefore  continually   drip-fed\ndiscursive developments enabling him to construct an intuitive  feel  for  what  will  be  successful\nimages of Scotland that fulfil  discourse  demands.  Whilst  such  demands  must  be  fulfilled,  the\npower  of  the  photographer  in  image  construction  arises  through  the  professional  skills   and\nknowledge of photographic practice. Once on location, the STB staff photographer is able to stage\nScotland and facilitate  the  transformation  of  consumers  through  professional  interpretation  of\ndiscourse.  Despite  reproducing  classic  views,  space  arises  through  professional  expertise  for\nphotographers  to  contribute  to  the  (re)packaging   of   Scotland;   they   experiment   with   new\ncompositions and content to create  new  photographic  ways  of  seeing  that  may  stimulate  new\ndiscursive developments by marketing managers.  By  selectively  seeing  landscapes  and  further\nselection of appropriate images from a days shoot,  the  staff  photographer  is  able  to  bring  new\nideas to marketing managers. Such actions bring interplay between  marketing  managers  and  the\nstaff photographer as each comment on images and their suitability, suggest further  developments\nand provide guidance  for  future  focus  in  image  style  and  content.  However,  ultimate  power\ncontinues to lie with marketing managers as they must  be  satisfied  discourse  is  being  correctly\nconveyed.\nThe final mediating space is that of the final design and presentation of images in brochures.  It  is\nthis final space that generates the most complex series of interplays  and  differences  between  the\nthree  main  agents  involved  in  image  construction.  The  most   intense   interplay   is   between\nmarketing managers and designers themselves as they enter an intense relationship which  focuses\non  achieving  a  design  that  fulfils  the  discursive  aims  clearly  outlined  in  the   design   brief.\nMarketing managers, as  clients,  therefore  continue  to  hold  ultimate  control  over  the  process;\nhowever,  designers,  like  photographers,  contribute  to  image  construction  through   spaces   of\nprofessional knowledge and expertise of  artistic  interpretation  and  aesthetic  awareness  as  they\ninitially select images for presentation, create secondary photographic briefs,  and  employ  design\ntechniques, such as varying  image  content  and  size,  colour  and  balance  to  create  a  readable,\naccessible  brochure  that  successfully  conveys  discourse   demands   and   facilitates   consumer\ntransformation into place. Additionally, through design know-how, space  exists  for  designers  to\nfacilitate the re-packaging  of  Scotland  by  creating  new  looks  and  keeping  designs  fresh  and\ninnovative, thus refreshing and redirecting Scotland\u2019s  existing  look  by  presenting  the  brand  in\nways that have never been seen before. Nevertheless, the brief has to be fulfilled!\nFocusing on the specifics of taking and presenting images in accordance with discourse  demands,\nthis paper points to the emergence of an extremely complex set of processes, which, whilst at  first\nglance appearing rather simplistic, offer a wide range of  interplays  and  difference  within  image\nconstruction in  tourist  brochures.  Founded  in  client\/contractor  power  relations,  interplay  and\ndifference between and amongst  all  agents  in  all  spaces  of  mediation  ensures  the  conceptual\nelements of imagery are encompassed in the finished product.  Consequently,  all  that  remains  is\nfor consumers to open their imagination and feel their way into Scotlands mediated landscapes.\nReferences\nAdler, J.
