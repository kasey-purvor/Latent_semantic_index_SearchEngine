Information technology played an important role in supporting QI \nactivity, but participants identified it as facilitative rather than delivering QI by itself. More \nimportant was achieving widespread clinical engagement through persuasion and appeal to \nshared professional values by clinical leaders.  \nEffects of change: Simple process measures such as glycated haemoglobin measurement \nrapidly improved. More complex process measures such as eye screening improved more \nslowly, and were more dependent on redesign of the care pathway. Improvement was greater \nfor type-2 than type-1 diabetes. Significant shifts of care for type-2 diabetes into primary care \nwere achieved, but were harder to achieve without additional resources. \nLessons learnt: Delivering better care to whole populations across organisational and \nprofessional boundaries required sustained work over long periods, and at all levels of the \nsystem of care. Past network focus on clinical collaboration has been effective at improving \n 4 \nclinical process and outcome, and the network is now prioritising work with managers and \npatients to support future redesign. \n 5 \nKey learning points \nQuality improvement (QI) activity within the Tayside Diabetes Managed Clinical Network \n(TDMCN) initially focused on changing individual and small team professional practice, and \ntask redesign within the existing care pathway. This delivered large improvements in \nprocesses of care, and to a lesser extent, intermediate outcomes.  \n \nInformation technology played an important role in QI activity by supporting clinical care \nand communication (via a web-based shared record), by automating audit and feedback (via \nthe regional registry) and by facilitating knowledge dissemination and management (via the \nnetwork website).  \n \nKey to network success was engagement of primary care and specialist clinicians in quality \nimprovement. This was achieved through negotiation to achieve consensus across the \nmultidisciplinary team on network vision and short to medium term goals, facilitated by \nleadership being enthusiastic and committed, and shared between specialists and general \npractitioners. \n \nParticipants in the evaluation identified lack of patient and managerial involvement during \nthe network\u2019s formative years as problematic. In the last 2-3 years, the network has actively \nsought to increase patients\u2019 involvement in network planning and self-care, and to make \ngeneral NHS management more engaged partners in network quality improvement.   \n \n 6 \nBACKGROUND \nOutline of problem \nThe rising incidence and prevalence of diabetes presents a growing challenge to health \nservices internationally.1 Systematically implementing national diabetes guidelines2 is \ndifficult though, because it requires clinical care and quality improvement to be co-ordinated \nacross existing health service and disciplinary boundaries. In the UK, National Service \nFrameworks provide additional guidance on how clinical guidelines can be delivered, and \nrecommend the creation of clinical networks with responsibility for all diabetes care in an \narea.3-7  However, there is little reported evidence as to how networks should be organised or \ntheir effectiveness.8 9 This paper describes the form and impact of quality improvement work \nin the Tayside Diabetes Managed Clinical Network (TDMCN), which has previously been \nidentified as a model for UK diabetes services.10  \n \nOutline of the context \nThe Tayside Region of Scotland has a population of ~385,000, and includes deprived urban \nareas, small towns, and remote, rural areas. Primary healthcare is provided by 72 general \npractices, with specialist diabetes services delivered from three sites (a teaching hospital \ndiabetes centre, and two district general hospitals), plus outreach clinics in small towns \ndistant from these. The number of people with diabetes in the region increased by ~50% \nbetween January 1998 and January 2005, from 8,846 (2.3% prevalence) to 13,527 (3.5%).  \n \nThis report is based on an independent evaluation of TDMCN conducted in 2004\/5. The \nevaluation examined the quality improvement (QI) strategies used by the network between \n1998 and 2005 through analysis of network documents (annual reports, planning documents, \n 7 \nminutes of network meetings), observation of meetings, and qualitative interview with \nmultidisciplinary team members and patients. The impact of these activities was \nquantitatively examined by analysis of data extracted from the regional diabetes register. The \nevaluation was approved by Tayside Local Research Ethics Committee. \nThis report is based on an independent evaluation of TDMCN conducted in 2004\/5. The \nevaluation examined the quality improvement (QI) strategies used by the network between \n1998 and 2005 through analysis of network documents (annual reports, planning documents, \nminutes of network meetings), observation of meetings, and qualitative interview with \nmultidisciplinary team members and patients. The impact of these activities was \nquantitatively examined by analysis of data extracted from the regional diabetes register. The \nevaluation was approved by Tayside Local Research Ethics Committee. \n \n \n \nProfessionals were purposively sampled from MCN committees, and from general practices \nthat were high and low users of the MCN website. We were unable to identify high and low \nwebsite users reliably in hospital settings and so used snowballing techniques to recruit \nhospital professionals with variable levels of commitment to the MCN. People with diabetes \nwere sampled from high and low web-using general practices, but initial analysis indicated \nthat they had little knowledge of the MCN as an organisation. We therefore instead recruited \nlay representatives on MCN committees to explore the perspectives of informed patients \n(Table 2). Semi-structured interview schedules were used and lasted 30-70 minutes, and were \ntaped and transcribed.  \n \n 8 \nTable 1: In-depth interviews \nInterviews with: Initial sampling frame Completed \nMCN core management group and Tayside \nDiabetes Advisory Group (TDAG) \n6 9 \nGeneral practitioners 4 3 \nPractice nurses 4 4 \nPractice managers 4 A \nHospital professionals 6 8 \nPatients sampled via practices 8 4 \nSupplementary interviews (patient \nrepresentatives and Trust managers) \nAs indicated by initial \nanalysis \n5 \nTotal 32 36 \n \n \nASSESSMENT OF PROBLEMS \nSince the late 1990s, clinical data for all people with diabetes in Tayside has been entered \ninto a regional register. Accuracy and completeness is maintained by the use of a unique \nidentifier throughout NHS Tayside (the Community Health Index number), and routine data \nchecking and correction by MCN data facilitators. In 1998, a complete audit of all people \nwith diabetes in Tayside identified widespread deficiencies in care, with inappropriately low \nlevels of clinical process and outcome (table 1). This prompted widespread recognition that \nchange was essential in both primary and secondary care.11 12  \n 9 \nTable 1: Quality of diabetes care in Tayside 1\/1\/98 \nIndicator* Type-1 diabetes  \n% achieving indicator \n(numerator\/denominator) \nType-2 diabetes \n% achieving indicator \n(numerator\/denominator) \nGlycated haemoglobin measured  58.2 (686\/1178)  58.8 (4511\/7668) \nBlood pressure measured  50.8 (598\/1178)  61.1 (4685\/7668) \nTotal cholesterol measured   20.0 (236\/1178)  26.5 (2031\/7668) \nCreatinine measured  31.4 (370\/1178)  41.7 (3199\/7668) \nFoot vascular status assessed  35.5 (418\/1178)  47.2 (3621\/7668) \nFoot neurological status assessed  28.5 (336\/1178)  38.2 (2929\/7668) \nRetinal screening  57.3 (675\/1178)  66.6 (5111\/7668) \nSmoking status recorded  77.6 (914\/1178)  82.9 (6357\/7668) \nGlycated haemoglobin \u226410%   77.7 (533\/686)  90.4 (4077\/4511) \nGlycated haemoglobin \u22647%  13.6 (93\/686)  42.8 (1933\/4511) \nSystolic blood pressure  \u2264 140mmHg  78.4 (469\/598)  50.7 (2374\/4685) \nDiastolic blood pressure \u2264 80mmHg  75.4 (451\/598)  57.8 (2710\/4685) \nTotal cholesterol \u2264 5mmol\/l  43.2 (103\/236)  30.7 (624\/2031) \n \n*Process measures = percentage of patients with record of process in previous 12 months; intermediate outcome \nmeasures = percentage of patients with measurement in last 12 months achieving target \n \n \nSTRATEGIES FOR CHANGE \nQuality improvement activities implemented \nThe working assumption from the outset was that there are no single interventions, or \u2018magic \nbullets\u2019, that are guaranteed to improve quality.13 TDMCN therefore progressively \nimplemented a range of complementary QI strategies, within a supportive national context \nthat included national guidelines14 and guidance,4 and quality improvement orientated \nregulation15 by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland16. Table 2 shows the scope of the QI \nactivities undertaken by TCMCN, and when each was first implemented. Analysis drew on \nFerlie and Shortell\u2019s multilevel framework for healthcare quality improvement17 to which \nnetwork activities to reinforce shared goals and systematic care broadly map, although \nTDMCN predates and did not explicitly follow this, or any other QI model.  \n \n 10 \nTable 2: Quality improvement strategies used in Tayside Diabetes Managed Clinical Network, and in Scotland \n \nLevels17 \nStrategies used by TDMCN \n(Strategies not used by TDMCN in brackets) \nExamples (identified from documentary and interview data) Used from \nwhen? \nIndividual professional \nEducation \nData feedback \nBenchmarking \nGuidelines, protocol, pathway implementation \nLeadership development \n \n(Academic detailing) \n \nSingle and multi-professional, varying levels, locally organised and\/or using wider resources eg Warwick Diabetes Course18 \nRoutine via stand-alone regional register initially, then via DARTS\/SCI-DC19 \nRoutine individual practice comparison with regional and locality averages via DARTS\/SCI-DC19 \nTayside Diabetes Handbook available via MCN website is a locally modified set of national guidelines (SIGN)14 19  \nStrong central leadership with considerable delegation to task focused TDAG subgroups19 \n \n(Not explicitly used) \n \n1998 \n1996 \n1998 \n2000 \n1999 \n \nGroups\/teams of professionals \nTeam development  \nTask redesign  \nClinical audits \nGuidelines, protocol, pathway implementation \n \n \n(Breakthrough collaborative) \n \nMulti-disciplinary collaborative working central to MCN ethos18 \nFor example, of eye screening, education for people with newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes, care for patients starting insulin18 \nStand-alone regional register was designed for audit; DARTS\/SCI-DC includes practice audit tools19 \nSingle shared guidelines and protocols for all professional groups disseminated via MCN website.19 \nCare pathway redesign in 2002, but implementation has been slow \n \n(Some Tayside practices are part of the Scottish Care Collaborative which has a diabetes arm, but not an MCN initiative) \n \n1998 \n2000 \n1996 \n2000 \n2002 \n \n(2003) \nOrganisation \nQuality assurance \nOrganisation development \nKnowledge management \/transfer \n \nPublic disclosure \n \n(Continuous quality improvement) \n \nRoutine data collection and audit via DARTS\/SCI-DC, locally agreed but consistent with national standards14 \nRegional service redesign with creation of new care pathway, although never fully implemented20 \nRegionally co-ordinated multidisciplinary education and training, knowledge dissemination via MCN website and \nnewsletters19 \nAnnual reports, regional quality data and key network documents published via MCN website19 \n \n(Not explicitly used) \n \n1996 \n2002 \n2000 \n \n2000 \n \nLarger system \/ environment \nNational bodies \n \nAccrediting licensing agencies \nPayment policies \n \n(Evidence-based practice centres) \n(Legal system) \n \nScottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guidelines for diabetes14;  \nScottish Diabetes Group and Framework4 21 \nQuality Improvement Scotland review of diabetes services against national standards, and MCN accreditation16 \n2004 General Medical Services (General Practitioner) contract22 \n \n \n1996 \n2002 \n2002 \n2004 \n \n 11 \nBetween 1998 and 2005, TDMCN primarily encouraged systematic, guideline-driven care by \nfocusing on changing the clinical practice of individual professionals and small, \nmultidisciplinary teams. Areas of activity identified by participants as key are briefly \ndescribed below (more detailed information can be found on the network website19). \n \na) Guidelines, protocol, pathway implementation \nNational guidelines were locally modified to create the Tayside Diabetes Handbook, \navailable in both paper and electronic form. Matching patient information leaflets were \ncreated and made available electronically, combining information about both diabetes and \nservices available. Guideline implementation was achieved primarily through audit, feedback, \nand professional education, focusing on changing routine clinical practice, supplemented \nwhere necessary with task redesign. Between 1998 and 2002, the emphasis was on ensuring \nthat key care processes and outcomes were delivered, with less attention paid to ensuring that \nonly patients needing specialist care attended hospital. In 2002, a new care pathway was \ndefined by a multi-disciplinary working group, which clearly identified when primary or \nspecialist care was appropriate for people with type-2 diabetes.20 Implementation was \nmonitored through changes in the proportion of people with type-2 diabetes attending \nhospital.  \n \nb) Education \nProfessional education has been tailored to varying levels of clinician interest, from locality-\nbased multi-disciplinary diabetes forums where educational form and content were \ndetermined by participants, through development of a local MSc level module, to sponsorship \nfor professionals to undertake an intensive course in diabetes management.23 \n 12 \n \nc) Audit, feedback and benchmarking \nRoutine feedback to practices of performance on clinical process and outcome measures has \noccurred since 1996 using the regional register to provide comparison with other practices in \nthe locality. Since 2000, network performance has been publicly reported annually.  \n  \nd) Task redesign within the existing care pathway \nExamples include rapid delivery of national policy requirements for universal digital \nretinopathy screening in 2003\/4 including extending the use of mobile screening units to \nensure equity of access in rural areas; design and implementation of group education for \npeople with newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes; and group rather than individual conversion to \ninsulin therapy. \n \ne) Care pathway redesign \nFrom the outset, the majority of patients with type-2 diabetes received the bulk of their care \nin the community, either exclusively or as part of a \u2018shared-care\u2019 scheme. However, large \nnumbers of uncomplicated patients attending hospital clinics with limited capacity led to \nsignificant waits for routine appointments.  In 2002, the network therefore created a new care \npathway20 to focus specialist resources on those most likely to benefit from them, with full \nimplementation dependent on significantly increasing the proportion of people with type-2 \ndiabetes cared for exclusively in primary care. In the absence of new resources, guidelines \nand persuasion were the only strategies available to achieve this.  \n 13 \nNetwork resources and organisation facilitating change \na) Resources \nSince 1998, there has been no change in specialist medical, dietetics or podiatry resource, \napart from the addition of one whole time equivalent diabetes specialist nurse, and investment \nin staff and equipment for retinal screening from 2003. Formalisation as an MCN led to \nstable funding for a whole-time network manager, secretary and data facilitator, and part-time \nclinical lead and IT support posts. However, considerable time was voluntarily given to MCN \ndevelopment by its clinical members, and diabetes-focused work in primary care was not \nformally reimbursed until the introduction of a new contract in 2004. Changes in care \ntherefore primarily reflect a widespread clinical commitment to implement systematic care, \nrather than direct investment in service delivery.  \n \nb) Network organisation and leadership  \nFrom the outset, leadership in TDMCN has been shared, with key posts held jointly by a \nspecialist and a primary care doctor. Overall responsibility for quality improvement and \nsetting MCN strategy lies with the Tayside Diabetes Advisory Group, which has \nrepresentation from patients, all professional groups involved in diabetes services, and NHS \nTayside Health Board. Responsibility for specific developments has been delegated to \nclinically-led sub-groups focused on particular tasks (including guidelines development; eye, \nfoot  and pregnancy care; data governance; and professional and patient education).19 \nClinicians interviewed for the evaluation identified this combination of shared leadership and \ninvolvement of all professional groups in network planning as key to ensuring widespread \nclinical commitment to change, with trust engendered by shared professional values and \nexplicit negotiation of priorities and activities.  \n 14 \n \nc) Information technology \nIT has been at the heart of QI activity since network inception. The original standalone, \nmanually updated regional register of the late 1990s evolved into a web-based diabetes record \nfrom 2000 that is automatically populated from primary care and hospital IT systems, and has \nsince been implemented across Scotland. The record supports individual clinical care, audit \nand feedback to practices, and monitoring of process and outcome across the network. It \nadditionally underpins network-organised care including recall for eye-screening and booking \nof group education for people with newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes. Access to the clinical \nrecord along with audit and data feedback tools is via the MCN website, which also provides \naccess to the Tayside Diabetes Handbook, patient information leaflets, and information about \nthe network including personnel, services provided, and network reports and strategy \ndocuments.19  \n \nEffects of change \na) Clinical process and outcome \nTables 3 and 4 compare clinical processes and outcomes in January 1998 and January 2005 \nfor type-1 and type-2 diabetes. Figures 1-8 in the web-supplement show patterns of change \nover the whole period. Reflecting implementation of routine registration and recall, simple \nclinical processes performed by individual clinicians (taking blood, measuring blood \npressure, recording smoking status) rapidly improved early in network development, reaching \nhigh levels by 2000 with slow improvement towards maximum since. More complex \nprocesses like foot examination have shown continued slow improvement over the whole \nperiod, and retinal screening has only shown significant improvement since the redesign of \n 15 \nthe regional eye screening service (although the quality of both foot and eye screening has \nimproved over the whole period with shifts to routine use of monofilaments for foot \nexamination, and to all retinal screening now being by quality-assured digital photography). \nProcess measures for people with type-2 diabetes have improved more than for those with \ntype-1.  \n \nInterpretation of intermediate outcome data should be cautious, since significant numbers of \npatients were not regularly screened in the early years. Since unscreened patients are likely to \nhave worse control, engaging more patients in care may initially lead to worse measured \noutcomes.24 For people with type-2 diabetes, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and \ncholesterol are significantly lower. Glycaemic control worsened in the first three years but \nhas shown improvement since. For people with type-1 diabetes, intermediate outcomes are \nonly improved for cholesterol control (although again, glycaemic control worsened in the \nearly years of the network, and has been improving since).  \n \n \n 16 \nTable 3: Change in quality 1st January 1998 to 1st January 2005 for people with type-1 diabetes \nIndicator* % (n) achieving \nmeasure 1\/1\/98  \n% (n) achieving \nmeasure 1\/1\/05  \nDifference 1998-2005 \n(95% confidence interval) \np-value# Pattern of change (see web-only \nfigures 1-8) \nGlycated haemoglobin measured 58.2  (1178) 91.2  (1471)  33.0  (29.8 to 36.2) <0.001 Rapid rise before 2000 \nBlood pressure measured 50.8  (1178) 77.3  (1471)  26.5  23.0 to 30.1) <0.001 Rapid rise before 2000 \nCholesterol measured 20.0  (1178) 71.0  (1471)  51.0  (47.8 to 54.3) <0.001 Rapid rise before 2000 \nCreatinine measured 31.4  (1178) 79.1  (1471)  47.7  (44.3 to 51.0) <0.001 Rapid rise before 2000 \nSmoking recorded 77.6  (1178) 93.5  (1471)  15.9  (13.2 to 18.6) <0.001 Rapid rise before 2000 \nFoot vascular status assessed 35.5  (1178)  61.7  (1471)  26.2  (22.5 to 29.9) <0.001 Slow continuous improvement \nFoot neurological status assessed 28.5  (1178) 60.8  (1471)  32.3  (28.7 to 35.9) <0.001 Slow continuous improvement \nRetinal screening 57.3  (1178) 74.2  (1471)  16.9  (13.1 to 20.5) <0.001 Improvement after redesign in 2003 \nGlycated haemoglobin<=10% 77.7  (686) 78.4  (1345)  0.7  (-3.1 to 4.5) 0.72 Worse till 2001, improving since \nGlycated haemoglobin<=7% 13.6  (686) 12.2  (1345)  -1.3  (-4.4 to 1.8) 0.39 Worse till 2001, improving since \nSystolic blood pressure <=140mmHg 78.4  (598) 72.2  (1144)  -6.2  (-10.4 to -2.0) 0.005 Recent deterioration \nDiastolic blood pressure <=80mmHg 75.4  (598) 74.0  (1144)  -1.5  (-5.7 to 2.8) 0.51 No significant change \nCholesterol <=5mmol\/l 43.2  (236) 60.3  (1078)  17.1  (10.1 to 24.0) <0.001 Slow continuous improvement \n \nMean glycated haemoglobin (%) \n \n8.75 \n \n8.88 \n  \n 0.13  (0.02 to 0.24) \n \n0.008 \n \nWorse till 2001, improving since \nMean systolic blood pressure (mmHg) 129.4 132.4  3.0  (1.7 to 4.3)  <0.001 Recent deterioration \nMean diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 76.2 75.1  -1.1  (-1.8 to -0.4) 0.001 Slow continuous improvement \nMean cholesterol (mmol\/l) 5.28 4.85  -0.43  (-0.51 to -0.35) <0.001 Slow continuous improvement \n \n*Process measures = percentage of patients with record of process in previous 12 months;

Comparisons of intermediate outcomes are \nparticularly problematic because of sensitivity to case-mix variation. Additionally, the 2004 \ngeneral practice contract incentivises many of the measures presented here, although it is \nnotable that quality improvement in Tayside long predates financial incentives.22 Table 5 \ncompares process quality in Tayside against the English National Diabetes Audit and the \nScottish Diabetes Survey in 2004, and is consistent with TDMCN having above average \nquality in this period.  \n \nTable 5: Comparison of Tayside, English National Diabetes Audit (NDA), and Scottish \nDiabetes Survey process data for adult type-1 and type-2 diabetes combined \nProcess done* Tayside June 2004 \n \nN=12,871 \nEnglish NDA 2004 \n \nN=253,000 \nScottish Diabetes \nSurvey 2004 \n(Scottish mean) \nN=161,946 \nGlycated haemoglobin measured \nCholesterol measured \nBlood pressure measured \nCreatinine measured \nRetinopathy screening \n96% \n91% \n93% \n96% \n83% \n76% \n75% \n86% \n75% \n47% \n74% \n69% \n78% \n69% \n60% \n*Previous 12 months for Tayside and English NDA, previous 15 months for Scottish Diabetes Survey \n \nb) Shifting care for uncomplicated type-2 diabetes into primary care \nRates of hospital referral for people newly diagnosed with type-2 diabetes fell dramatically \nbetween 2002 and 2006, with a smaller 13% fall in the proportion of patients attending the \nhospital in the previous 15 months (table 6). However, because of rising prevalence the total \nnumbers of patients with type-2 diabetes being treated in hospital remained unchanged, \n 19 \ndespite an additional 3191 patients being exclusively treated in primary care (a 66.2% \nincrease).  \n \nTable 6: Hospital attendance for people with type-2 diabetes 2002-2006 \n  \n2002 \n \n2006 \nChange in % attending \nhospital \nHospital referral at diagnosis \n(patients newly diagnosed in \ncalendar year) \nReferred \nNot referred \n \nHospital review in 15 months \nprior to 31st Dec (all patients) \nHospital review* \nExclusive primary care \n \n \n \n \n 597 (47.0) \n 672 (53.0) \n \n \n \n 5665 (54.0) \n 4819 (46.0) \n \n \n \n126 (9.8) \n1162 (90.2) \n \n \n \n5615 (41.2) \n8010 (58.8) \n \n \n \n \n-37.3 (95% CI -33.8 to -40.8) \np<0.001 \n \n \n \n-12.8 (95% CI -11.6 to -14.1) \np<0.001 \n* Includes shared care with general practice \n \nOverall, there was rapid improvement in simpler processes of care, with slower and \ncontinuing improvements for complex processes where achievement requires more intensive \nprofessional education or redesign of relevant parts of the care pathway. The impact on \nintermediate outcomes is significant but smaller, particularly for people with type-1 diabetes. \nThere has been a major shift to primary care for people with type-2 diabetes. However, \nbecause of static resources in the face of rising prevalence, hospital clinics continue to work \nat capacity which has prevented full implementation of the redesigned care pathway.  \n \nNext steps  \nParticipants in the evaluation identified three weaknesses of the initial TDMCN model, which \nare currently being addressed by the network. First, the initial emphasis was overwhelmingly \n 20 \non professional engagement, reflecting QI frameworks and service organisation at the time.17 \nSince 2003\/4, the network has actively increased patients\u2019 involvement in network planning \nand in their own care, notably through redesign of patient education, implementing automatic \nproduction of individualised patient information from the web-based clinical record, and \ncreating a patient portal. This reflects growing appreciation of the potential for patient and \npublic involvement to improve quality of care.25 26 Second, the professionals initially engaged \nby the network were predominately clinicians, with less attention paid to NHS management. \nThis proved limiting when additional resources were required to fully implement care \npathway redesign in the face of rapidly rising prevalence. Recent more active network \ncollaboration with NHS management has led to Health Board investment to facilitate fuller \nimplementation of the new care pathway. Finally, type-2 diabetes care was initially \nprioritised, which is reflected in slower improvement in quality of care for people with type-1 \ndiabetes. Type-1 diabetes is now a network and national21 priority, although quality \nimprovement will at least partly depend on the ability of the network to free specialist \nresource by shifting an even greater proportion of routine type-2 diabetes care into primary \ncare. The impact of these next steps will be the subject of future evaluation.  \n \n \nWider implications \nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic, independent evaluation of a \nmanaged clinical network anywhere in the UK where patient outcomes have been studied.17 \nTDMCN implemented and sustained QI activity at all levels of the system of care. Although \nparticipants said that they could not easily identify which QI intervention had had the most \nimpact, they did highlight the central role of information technology in supporting QI. \n 21 \nHowever, participants were clear that IT alone did not change practice. More important was \nthe way in which TDMCN successfully engaged clinicians across the region and across \nprofessional boundaries, persuading them to commit to improving quality of care for \nincreasing numbers of people with diabetes without significant additional resources. One \nsignificant driver for this was the provision of a range of educational interventions, but the \nkey facilitator was network leadership by enthusiastic clinicians, with a clear vision for an \neffective and equitable system of diabetes care, and a commitment to collaboration \ndemonstrated by leadership being shared between specialists and general practitioners. \nAlthough the generalisability of networks remains uncertain, TDMCN\u2019s experience therefore \nshows the potential of diabetes clinical networks to engage with clinicians across whole \nsystems and deliver changes in professional practice and better patient care by deploying an \nappropriate range of IT-facilitated QI activities.  \n \n 22 \nReferences \n1.
