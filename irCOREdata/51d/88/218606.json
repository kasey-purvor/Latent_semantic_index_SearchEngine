Over the last two\nyears this journal has devoted particular attention to the problem of\nmeasuring the policy preferences of legislators (e.g., Alem\u00e1n et al.\n2009; Carroll et al. 2009; Carrubba, Gabel, and Hug 2008; Clinton\nand Jackman 2009; Hix and Noury 2009; Saiegh 2009; Schickler and\nPearson 2009). Here we contribute to this discussion by focusing on\nthe estimates of policy positions of parties in legislatures on different\ndimensions over time.\nIn comparative legislative research, there are many sources of\ndata from which estimates of the policy positions of key political\nactors\u2014be these legislators or legislative parties\u2014can be derived.\nThese include, among others: mass surveys; expert surveys; political\ntext; roll-call votes; and bill sponsorship (see Benoit and Laver 2006,\nfor a review). By far the most abundant source of data on policy\npositions, both cross-sectionally and over time, is political text. Text is\na direct by-product of political activity by the political actors whose\npositions we wish to estimate, whether this text takes the form of\nspeeches, debates, written submissions, written rulings, or\u2014by far the\nmost commonly used in the profession for estimating party policy\npositions\u2014election manifestos issued by political parties. These mani-\nfestos outline policies that parties will enact once elected to legislative\nor executive office and serve as the empirical basis for many models of\nparty competition in legislative and other policymaking settings.\nThe wide availability of these materials in electronic form has led\nto a large number of automated and semiautomated methods for scaling\npositions from political texts based on the statistical analysis of word\npatterns (e.g., Bara, Weale, and Biquelet 2007; Benoit and Laver 2003;\nHilliard, Purpura, and Wilkerson 2007; Hopkins and King 2010; Klem-\nmensen, Hobolt, and Hansen 2007; Laver and Garry 2000; Lowe 2008;\nMartin and Vanberg 2007; Monroe and Maeda 2004; Pennings and\nKeman 2002; Quinn et al. 2010; Slapin and Proksch 2008; Yu, Kauf-\nmann, and Diermeier 2008). Despite this growth in automated methods,\nhowever, the most common means of analyzing political text remains\nmanual content analysis (Krippendorff 2004; Neuendorf 2002). In a\ntraditional manual content analysis, a predefined categorical coding\nscheme is applied to segments of text by trained human coders (e.g.,\nBaumgartner, Green-Pedersen, and Jones 2008). The most comprehen-\nsive and most frequently used such dataset comes from the Comparative\nManifesto Project (Budge et al. 2001; Klingemann et al. 2006, hereaf-\nter CMP) which contains the results of coding more than 3,000 election\nmanifestos for more than 650 parties in over 50 countries. CMP data\n124 Will Lowe et al.\nform the basis for hundreds of published studies by third-party authors\nand are almost always used to estimate policy positions for political\nparties on left-right scales.Almost everyone using CMP data does so for\nthe same reason: they want to estimate positions of parties on different\ncommon policy dimensions. Doing this typically implies assuming that\na set of party positions, whether a cross-section or a time series, can be\nlocated on some (continuously defined) metric scale. Such a scale\nallows analysts to make statements to the effect that, for example: party\nA is \u201cmoving\u201d towards the left; partiesA andB are \u201ccloser\u201d to each other\nthan either is to party C; given parties A, B, and C, the \u201cmedian\nlegislator\u201d in the set of three parties is at X; and so on. Spatial theories\nof policy preferences typically assume that party positions exist on a\ncontinuous scale, usually an interval scale, although content coding\nschemes such as the CMP record only absolute and relative category\ncounts of discrete text units. To convert these observed category counts\ninto points on a continuous policy dimension, therefore, some scaling\nprocedure is required. The CMP data offer several general political\nscales based on aggregating counts of text categories. The most widely\nused of these is the CMP\u2019s left-right \u201cRile\u201d scale, constructed by\nsubtracting the sum of 13 \u201cleft\u201d-associated categories from the sum of\n13 \u201cright\u201d-oriented categories.1 There are many different ways to con-\nstruct such scales, however, and the choice of scaling procedure\ninvolves decisions that must be defended on methodological and sub-\nstantive grounds.\nIn this article we present a new method for scaling continuous\nleft-right policy positions from political text coded into discrete\ncategories and demonstrate its superiority to current approaches.\nComparing our measure to previous scales, we demonstrate that our\nproposed scale not only better satisfies general political, linguistic,\nand psychological criteria, but also that it exhibits superior empirical\nproperties when applied to the CMP data. We validate our new scale\nexternally through comparison to independent expert surveys. Not\nonly can our new approach be applied to improve existing policy\nestimates for the most commonly used CMP scales, it can also be\nused with existing CMP data to unlock reliable positional estimates on\nnew policy dimensions. These new and improved scales will provide\nresearchers in legislative studies with not only more valid measures\nof the policy positions than ever before, but also unlock measures\nfor previously unused dimensions of policy that can be used to test\nempirical models of party competition, legislative coalitions, govern-\nment formation, and executive-legislative relations. To make the scale\nimmediately useful to applied researchers, we provide a full dataset,\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 125\ndescribed in an appendix and in Tables 1 and 3, of these newly scaled\npolicy positions with 21 new left-right scales, at least half of which\nhave never before been used in applied, published research. Following\nthe method for estimating uncertainty from political text of Benoit,\nLaver, and Mikhaylov (2009), we also provide confidence intervals\nfor every new estimate. Finally, by justifying and demonstrating what\ntypes of coding categories are best compared to create continuous\nscales, our findings provide direct lessons for the future design of\nimproved political text coding schemes.\nHow Should Policy Mentions Be Counted?\nThe CMP\u2019s manual coding process involves several stages. In\nthe first step, a human coder is given a political party manifesto, which\nhe or she then divides into discrete, nonoverlapping text units known\nas \u201cquasi-sentences.\u201d Quasi-sentences are textual units that express a\npolicy proposition and may be either a complete natural sentence or\npart of one. Once identified, the quasi-sentence is then assigned to one\nof 56 mutually exclusive policy categories, distributed across seven\nbroad policy domains such as \u201cPolitical System\u201d or \u201cEconomy.\u201d CMP\ndata thus take the form of counts of sentences in categories, a unit of\nanalysis that is intermediate between the more holistic analysis offered\nby an interpretative approach and more detailed syntactic analyses\n(Popping 2007; van Atteveldt, Kleinnijenhuis, and Ruigrok 2008) and\npurely lexical approaches (Laver, Benoit, and Garry 2003; Slapin and\nProksch 2008). Category counts are then converted to percentages by\ndividing by the total number of sentences in the manifesto. These\ncategory percentages are then either interpreted directly as conveying\ninformation about the policy preferences of their authors or may be\nadditively scaled to construct more general indices.\nNormalizing counts this way makes sense under three conditions\nthat we will not, for the purposes of this article, dispute: first, the\nsentence is the fundamental unit of policy assertion; second, different\nsentences assigned to the same category are exchangeable or indepen-\ndently distributed conditional on their policy category; third, the total\nnumber of sentences assigned to any policy category contains no\ninformation about the policy preferences that a platform expresses.\nThe precise choice of how to construct a left-right scale from the\nnormalized sentence counts, however, requires decisions to be made in\nthe construction of scales. Scaling category counts, that is, choosing a\nprocedure to transform observed category counts into estimates of\nunobserved policy positions, means addressing two independent\n126 Will Lowe et al.\nquestions about the content and the form of a scale. These are two\nfundamental questions to which we will return as we evaluate different\nmethods of scaling left and right policy.\nFirst, how should sentences be counted when constructing a scale\nfor a particular policy domain? Should one category be considered\nagainst an absolute standard, or relative to the counts in a different\ncategory, or perhaps relative to the entire document? Second, what is\nthe functional form of the relationship between position and counts?\nIn particular, what is the nature of the marginal effect on sentence\ncounts of changes in a party\u2019s position in the policy domain linked to\nthe sentence counts? While these two key issues frame a debate that\nhas previously occupied methodologists concerned specifically with\nscaling policy positions from the CMP data (e.g., Kim and Fording\n2002; McDonald and Mendes 2001a), the debate applies much more\ngenerally to any effort to construct continuous scales from text coded\ninto discrete categories. In what follows, we reexamine both issues\nfrom both a substantive political standpoint and also from linguistic\nand psychological perspectives.\nPrevious Approaches to Scaling Policy Measures\nIn the discussion of scaling measures we assume that for each\npolicy dimension there exists a \u201cleft\u201d and a \u201cright\u201d direction repre-\nsented by at least one CMP category.2 We will denote the number of\nsentences in a manifesto assigned to the \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d categories\nconstituting a policy issue as L and R, respectively, and the total\nnumber of sentences in all categories as N. (There is also an \u201cother\u201d\ncategory count O to completely partition the sentences, such that\nL + R + O = N.) For instance, for a policy dimension of more to less\nprotectionism, L would be the number of sentences coded to \u201c406\nProtectionism: Positive,\u201d while R would be the number of sentences\ncoded to \u201c407 Protectionism: Negative,\u201d and the corresponding \u201cPER\u201d\nvariables defined as\nL\nN\n100% and\nR\nN\n100%, respectively. The output\nof any scaling procedure is an estimate of the position which we will\nrefer to as q, superscripting to indicate the scaling procedure and\nsubscripting as necessary to indicate the policy dimension.\nPrevious Scaling Procedures\nThe CMP was designed to reflect \u201csaliency theory,\u201d a particular\nview of how parties compete and therefore how they express their\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 127\npolicy preferences, asserting that \u201call party programmes endorse the\nsame position, with only minor exceptions\u201d (Budge et al. 2001, 82).\nParties are assumed to differentiate themselves by emphasising issues\non which they have the best reputation with voters (Budge 1994).\nBecause positioning is a matter of emphasis, the answer to the first\ngeneral methodological question posed above must be that the fre-\nquency of quasi-sentences in one policy category should be compared\nto all other sentences in the manifesto. Budge (1999) suggests that\na party\u2019s position according to saliency theory, q(S ), should be defined as\n\u03b8 S R L\nN\n( )\n=\n\u2212\n.\nThis saliency measure is based on the difference in counts between left\nand right sentences counts normalized by the total number of sen-\ntences in the manifesto on any issue or on none.3 From this definition\nit is clear that the answer to the second general question posed above\nis that each count in L or R has the same marginal effect: 1\/N. The\nquantity q (S ) is equal to zero when there are exactly the same number\nof left- as right-coded sentences, -1 when there is only one issue on\nwhich the party is perfectly \u201cleft,\u201d and 1 when there is one issue and\nthe party is perfectly \u201cright.\u201d In practice, however, the extreme values\nare never reached because party competition almost never occurs on\none dimension only. For instance, the distribution of the CMP\u2019s \u201cRile\u201d\nleft-right index, a measure that encompasses 26 different coding cat-\negories, has an empirical range of about [-.5, .5].\nThere is a more subtle constraint on q (S ) hidden in this formula-\ntion. All theories accept that if an issue becomes less important then\na party will devote fewer sentences to it. That is, the relative counts\nR + L assigned to the contrasting policy pairs R and L, for a specific\npolicy subset of all policy dimensions in a manifesto, will shrink.\nBut because R + L is also by definition the maximum range of R - L,\nthen deemphasizing an issue will push q (S ) to a more centrist position\nby moving it closer to 0, even though the proportion of left and right\nsentences, the raw material for expressing a position, have not\nchanged. For the composite \u201cRile\u201d scale, this means that counts of the\n30 categories not in the scale still affect estimated party positions. For\ninstance, a 200-sentence manifesto with 100 right sentences and no\nleft sentences would have a Rile score of (50 - 0) = 50, but the same\nmanifesto with 50 sentences added that are neither left nor right would\nchange its Rile score to 40 (Benoit and Laver 2007; McDonald and\nMendes 2001b; Ray 2007)\u2014suggesting that the party shifted 20%\n128 Will Lowe et al.\ntoward the left. In the CMP, this approach is carried to an extreme by\nincluding even uncodeable content in the definition of a manifesto.4\nPrimarily in order to address this problem, Kim and Fording\n(2002) propose an alternative measure that restricts the difference to\nsentences from the constituent left and right categories (see also Laver\nand Garry 2000). This relative proportional difference estimate of\nposition is\n\u03b8 R R L\nR L\n( )\n=\n\u2212\n+\n.\nThe measure also ranges from -1 to 1, but makes explicit the range\nconstraint hidden in q (S ). Dividing by R + L decouples the measure\nfrom variation in the importance a party assigns to any issue area.\nThe only remaining influence of variable issue importance is\nthat the overall number of sentences available to express a position is\nincreased or reduced. To take an extreme case, only three positions are\nexpressible within a budget of two sentences: either both are left, both\nright, or one is assigned to each category, leading to estimated posi-\ntions of -1\/2, 0, or 1\/2. Coarse sampling does not necessarily imply\nanything about the party\u2019s actual position on the issue but rather limits\nthe level of nuance and specificity that it can be expressed in a mani-\nfesto and the precision that may be inferred from it by readers and\nresearchers. According to spatial theory assumptions the party has a\nposition on the issue dimensions, but has chosen to use its supply of\nsentences on other dimensions. Finally, unlike q (S ) this measure will\nnot necessarily create an apparent move to a more centrist position if\nthe party decides to focus on other policy areas.\nIn terms of the two methodological questions above, q (R)\ncompares category counts only to counts in the opposing category\nrather than to counts of all quasi-sentences. The marginal effect of\nanother sentence on the left or right side of the issue is therefore\n1\/(R + L).\nAlthough q (R) appears to fix the problem of sentences in unre-\nlated or uncoded categories affecting position estimates, it shares the\nassumptions embodied in q (S ) about the fixed marginal effect of\nanother coded sentence and the existence of fixed endpoints. This has\nthe unfortunate effect of forcing the q (R) to -1 when R = 0 irrespective\nof the value of L, or to 1 when L = 0 irrespective of the value of R,\nleading to spikes at the boundaries of the scale. That the scale has\nboundaries at all is a basic problem with both procedures that attempt\nto measure policy positions that are more naturally conceptualized in\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 129\nan underlying continuum. The essential insight behind q (R) is surely\ncorrect\u2014the position of a party on a policy dimension should depend\nonly on L and R. The problem is that the nature of the quantity being\nestimated is not respected in the measure. A different answer to the\nsecond general question is needed.\nA Scaling Method Based on Log Odds-Ratios\nTo motivate a new scaling method, consider the process of\nreading a party manifesto for changes in policy content, as a voter\nmight do, for example, if trying to identify any change in some party\u2019s\npolicy position on the European Union. If the party\u2019s previous plat-\nform contained 50 sentences in favour of increased European integra-\ntion, and 20 emphasizing its disadvantages, then a new manifesto\ncontaining 50 sentences in favor and 21 against would barely register\nas an indicator of policy change. But if the previous platform had\ncontained 10 and 4 sentences for and against the EU, and the new\nplatform 10 and 5, then a policy change is more plausible. This\nsuggests that the balance between assertions in favour of the EU and\nagainst it between platforms is usefully summarized not by the differ-\nence between sentence counts, but rather by their ratio. The effect of\nadding one more sentence in the first case decreases the ratio of pro-\nto anti-EU sentences by about 5%, and in the second by 20%. By this\nreasoning, the marginal effect of one more sentence is decreasing in\nthe amount that has already been said on the topic. Proportional or\nrelative emphasis on different topics does indeed determine a reader\u2019s\nestimate of position, but such changes must be perceivable against the\nbackground of existing policy emphasis.\nThis simple linguistic intuition about reading and writing mani-\nfestos can be supported by evidence from psychology. The decreasing\nmarginal effect of an extra unit is a general property of many percep-\ntual quantities such as temperature, heat, or loudness studied by psy-\nchophysicists.5 The Weber-Fechner law (Fechner 1965; Stevens 1957)\nformalises this observation: the size of the \u201cjust perceivable differ-\nence\u201d of a subjective quantity is a constant proportion of the quantity\nalready present.6 Consequently we should operate in proportions, not\nlevels, and work with a logarithmic scale relationship between the\nunderlying quantity and subjective estimations of it. For loudness, this\nrelationship is the familiar decibel scale, which relates perceived loud-\nness as the log of the physical power of the sound.7 Following this\nlogic it should also be possible to consider the \u201cjust perceivable policy\n130 Will Lowe et al.\ndifference,\u201d the proportional change necessary to infer a difference in\nposition on an issue between two party platforms.\nThe Logit Scale of Position\nOur logic suggests that from the point of view of a party mani-\nfesto writer wanting to communicate a position effectively, it is impor-\ntant to manipulate not so much the absolute quantity of sentences\nallocated (R + L), but rather their relative balance, or R\/L. Increasing\nR + L allows a wider range of expressible policy positions, but\nmanipulating R\/L expresses the position itself. Furthermore, because\nwe are primarily interested in inferring positions, we view it as most\nnatural to consider proportional changes on a symmetrical left-right\nscale. One natural measure for this purpose is the empirical logit:\n\u03b8 L R\nL\n( )\n=\n+\n+\nlog\n.\n.\n5\n5\n(1)\n= +( ) \u2212 +( ) 5 5log . log . .R L (2)\nLike q (R), q (L) is conditional because it only considers sentences that are\nassigned to left or right. Unlike q (S ) and q (R), however, the logit scale q (L)\nhas no predefined end points: given enough sentences, it is possible\nto generate positions of any level of extremity.8 In this respect, q (L)\nbetter reflects spatial politics assumptions about the possible range of\nideal points. However, although any real valued policy position can be\nrepresented, expressing extreme positions requires exponentially more\nsentences in L or R to move the policy position the same distance left or\nright as can be seen by considering its alternative formulation (2) as a\ndifference measure.9\nWe should note that although q (L) is defined as a (logged) ratio, it\noffers interval not ratio level measurement. In particular, q (L) = 0\nshould not automatically be identified as a substantively centrist policy\nposition. In the absence of an external anchor, e.g., to policy outcomes,\na centrist position would be some function of the mean or median\nposition on an issue of the parties contesting the election. How this\nposition will be expressed in R, L terms will depend on historically\ncontingent country-level factors.10\nUsing the logit function to transform count data represents a\nnovel approach to scaling left-right policy positions, but logit trans-\nformations are found in many inferential models used to estimate\nlatent party positions. Log odds-ratios form the basis of the most\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 131\ncommonly used statistical models of bounded count data (Agresti\n1996; Fleiss, Levin, and Paik 2003), item response and unfolding (Elff\n2008), and have been studied directly by Monroe, Quinn, and Colaresi\n(2008).11 Nevertheless, q (L) is explicitly not itself a model of the\nstructure of policy positions but rather a way to measure them that is\ncompatible with several theories of spatial politics. We do not pursue\nsuch models here because we are unwilling either to introduce the\nindependence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) constraint on policy\ndimensions that would be imposed by logit models or to estimate\nexplicitly the distribution of party positions on multiple dimensions as\nrequired by probit models. Consequently we also take no position on\nimportant substantive issues such as the underlying dimensionality\nof the policy space and the correlational structure connecting issue\ndimensions (Elff 2008; Gabel and Huber 2000) or the dynamics of\nparty positions over time. Our more modest goal here is to improve the\nfuture use of the hugely popular CMP dataset, after demonstrating a\nbetter way to scale policy positions than the CMP\u2019s existing, flawed\napproach. Furthermore, our confrontational pairing method provides\nscales for more policy dimensions than ever before used from the\nCMP dataset. Whether these new positions are comparable over time,\nor accurately reflect the underlying dimensions of politics, are separate\nquestions that are broader than we can feasibly address here.\nInstead, we focus on the scaling procedure that connects basic\ndata of the CMP\u2014counts of sentences in categories\u2014to the policy\npositions that form the substantive quantities of interest. Even without\nmaking model assumptions, we can show that q (L) is a far better\npredictor of party policy positions than previous measures.We do\nmake one concession towards model structure by adding 0.5 to all\ncounts, a standard statistical practice for the analysis of contingency\ntables (Agresti 1996) that can also be motivated as a measure to reduce\nbias when estimating category proportions (Brown, Cai, and Das-\nGupta 2001; Firth 1993). This smooths q (L) slightly towards 0 and\nmakes position estimates created from very small counts more stable,\nwhile barely affecting those derived from more reasonable numbers of\nsentences.\nA Log Scale of Policy Importance\nIn addition to having different positions on each of a given set\nof policy dimensions, political actors may also differ in terms of the\nrelative importance they attach to these dimensions. As Laver and\nHunt (1992) demonstrated, some issues are simply more important to\n132 Will Lowe et al.\nsome parties than to others, quite independent of their party positions\non these dimensions, a distinction long-recognized by other scholars\n(e.g., Grofman 2004; Riker 1996). We thus expect \u201cgreen\u201d parties to\ntreat the environmental dimension as the most important policy\ndomain, and indeed this is part of our implicit definition of the set of\ngreen parties. Likewise, we expect far-right parties to treat immigra-\ntion and social values as the most important dimensions. Both liberal\nand far-right parties might consider social values to be very important,\nyet take very different positions on this dimension. Scholars con-\ncerned with the policies of political actors are typically concerned\nwith both position and importance. Empirical methods often draw\nthis distinction very explicitly, as with the expert surveys of Laver and\nHunt (1992), Benoit and Laver (2006), and Hooghe et al. (2008).\nNotwithstanding this very clear analytical distinction between\nthe importance, or salience, of a policy dimension and party positions\non that dimension, the widely used policy scales (as opposed to raw\ndata) generated by the CMP are fundamentally grounded in the\nCMP\u2019s \u201csaliency theory\u201d of party competition (MPP, 76). This explic-\nitly conflates party positions on policy dimensions and the relative\nsalience of these dimensions. The core idea of saliency theory is that,\nin a given setting, parties will endorse only single sides of each issue,\nsuch as reducing crime, providing for the national defense, or protect-\ning the environment. Parties differentiate themselves by emphasizing\nthe issues on which their stances are most credible (MPP, 7). Conse-\nquently, the \u201ctaking up of positions is done through emphasizing the\nimportance of certain policy areas compared to others\u201d (Budge 1994,\n455).12 Operationally, \u201csaliency\u201d theory suggests that the relative\nmention of different policy areas in manifestos provides a direct\nmeasure of their importance to the party. Despite this prediction that\nissues are overwhelmingly one-sided, however, the CMP\u2019s coding\nscheme makes numerous practical concessions to the fact that many\nissues are clearly two-sided, such as positions on free trade, on the\nlevel of government regulation, or on attitudes toward European inte-\ngration. The existence of paired categories in the CMP scheme cov-\nering opposite sides of the same issue complicates the straightforward\nassessment of policy salience based on counting relative mentions of\na single policy category. Our solution is simple: to group mentions of\nan issue, whether positive or negative, and to consider their sum as\na direct indicator of policy importance. Our scale also follows the\npsychological and linguistic rationale for logarithmic emphasis as\nexplained previously, however.\nOur suggested measure of policy importance is\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 133\n\u03b8 I R L\nN\n( )\n=\n+ +\nlog ,\n1\nwith a value of 1.0 added to the numerator for consistency with the 0.5\nfor R and L in the position formulation. This measure follows directly\nfrom the relative emphasis logic of saliency theory and also conforms\nto the linguistic model we have already outlined by increasing\nlogarithmically in extremity with additional mentions.\nEstimating Scale Uncertainty\nIt has become widely accepted that text-based measures of policy\nquantities should come with associated estimates of uncertainty, rather\nthan simply being presented as if they contained no stochastic element\nor measurement error (see Benoit, Laver, and Mikhaylov 2009). For\nthis reason we also provide a means of computing standard errors and\nconfidence intervals associated with our new scales of position and\nimportance.\nIf a parametric measure of uncertainty is required, we suggest a\nsimple Bayesian approach: a standard Beta prior over the proportions\nof L and R sentences with parameters aR = aL = a implies a posterior\ndistribution over position that is well approximated as\n\u03b8 \u03bc \u03c3L R L( ) ( ), ,\u223c Normal 2\n\u03bc  = +( )\n+( )log\nR a\nL a\n\u03c3 2 1 1  = +( ) + +( )\u2212 \u2212R a L a\nwhen R + L \u0002 10. Setting a = 0.5 corresponds to a symmetrical invari-\nant Jeffreys prior over party position (Jeffreys 1946). This distribution\nabove suggests the 95% credible interval\n\u03b8 \u03c3 \u03b8 \u03c3L L( ) ( )\u2212 +[ ]1 96 1 96. , .\nwhich corresponds closely to the classical confidence intervals (when\nthey are defined) while being numerically more stable (Newcombe\n2001).\nMany counts of quasi-sentences representing R or L, however,\nmay be zero or close to zero in observed data, implying nonsymmetric\nbounds that will affect the parametric computation of confidence inter-\n134 Will Lowe et al.\nvals. An alternative to the parametric estimation that we propose is to\nuse bootstrapping methods (Efron and Tibshirani 1994) to provide\nnonparametric intervals by resampling R and L categories in each\npolicy dimension. In the dataset provided with this article and in the\nanalyses presented here, we compute nonparametric confidence inter-\nvals and standard errors for all position and importance scales repre-\nsented in the article, using the approach outlined by Benoit, Laver, and\nMikhaylov (2009).\nNew Policy Scales\nWe have constructed a set of 13 policy scales from the CMP\ndataset, each representing a distinct dimension of policy on which\nparties may take positions. These are detailed in Table 1. For each\nscale, we have identified a pair of CMP categories expressing policy\nopposites and classified the elements of each pair as either Right or\nLeft. The pairings in Table 1 are natural and probably closer to what\nwas originally intended by the designers of the CMP\u2019s coding\nscheme, although most are seldom or never used in this way. This\nalternative to the saliency approach has often been termed the \u201ccon-\nfrontational\u201d approach to policy (Budge et al. 2001; Gemenis and\nDinas 2010) and involves parties declaring competing positions on\nthe same issue. In this view of policy, what matters is not whether\neach party purports to emphasize the issue or downplay it, but rather\nwhat the party\u2019s specific policy stances are relative to the extreme\npositions on any given issue, for instance what degree of permissive-\nness or restrictiveness regulation it favors regarding the issues of\neuthanasia, homosexual marriage, and abortion (Laver 2001, 66) or\nwhether a party favours expanding the power of European-level insti-\ntutions or instead reinforcing national sovereignty. Our logit scale\nextends and generalizes this logic while applying the notion of rela-\ntive difference that also scales policy extremity in a way that relates\nto repetition in a nonlinear fashion.\nIn addition to these natural opposites, there are many categories\nfor which natural policy alternatives could have been identified when\nthe CMP coding scheme was being designed, but which do not in fact\nexist in the coding scheme. We identify these categories in Table 2.\nWith the sole exception of 408 Economic Goals, these categories all\nrelate to matters of public policy that are inherently positional.\nThe rationale for the CMP\u2019s unwillingness to define polar oppo-\nsites for these coding categories appears to be that one position seems\nlikely to be almost universally unpopular.

A closer look, however, reveals a more nuanced\npicture. On environmental policy, for instance, parties do not always\nproduce purely one-sided statements. Many parties do in fact take\nprogrowth stances that contain thinly veiled antienvironmental mes-\nsages. For instance, the 1988 Danish Liberal Party manifesto contains\nthis statement: \u201cEnvironmental policy should not result in Danish\ncompanies being worse off than the companies in the countries\nwith which we compete.\u201d13 The Danish Liberal Party is clearly not\nproenvironment, preferring instead to let the natural environment\nsuffer in exchange for the economic benefits that presumably come\nfrom easing environmental regulations on firms. This direct preference\nfor industry over the environment is in fact how other schemes for\nmeasuring environmental policy have expressed the environmental\npolicy dimension: as contrasting priorities for environmental protec-\ntion (at the cost of economic growth) versus economic growth (at the\ncost of environmental damage; Benoit and Laver 2006; Laver and\nHunt 1992). We believe that this logic of contrasting extremes applies\nquite generally.\nNot every quantity of end-user interest from the CMP may exist\nin the form of text units assigned to one of two bipolar categories.\nTABLE 2\nCMP Scales with No Natural Policy Opposites\nPolicy Issue CMP Category\nImperialism 103 Anti-Imperialism: Anti-Colonialism\nPeace 106 Peace: Positive\nFreedom\/Human Rights 201 Freedom and Human Rights: Positive\nDemocracy 202 Democracy: Positive\nEfficiency 303 Governmental and Administrative Efficiency: Positive\nCorruption 304 Political Corruption: Negative\nPolitical Authority 305 Political Authority: Positive\n(General) Economic Goals 408 Economic Goals\nCorporatism 405 Corporatism: Positive\nTechnology and Infrastructure 411 Technology and Infrastructure: Positive\nCultural Policy 502 Culture: Positive\nSocial Justice 503 Social Justice: Positive\nLaw and Order 605 Law and Order: Positive\nSocial Harmony 606 Social Harmony: Positive\nAgricultural Policy 703 Farmers: Positive\nMiddle Class Policy 704 Middle Class and Professional Groups: Positive\nAffirmative Action 705 Underprivileged Minority Groups: Positive\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 137\nIndeed, most users are only interested in the CMP dataset for its\naggregate left-right scale. Fortunately, our measure works equally well\nfor aggregated categories of R and L when each R and L consists of\nmore than one component category count. Furthermore, as with the\n\u201cRile\u201d index that includes quantities such as \u201c305 Political Authority:\nPositive\u201d that have no opposite category in the CMP coding scheme,\nmany of these measures may denote right-measured positions yet not\nbe usable in any simple, bipolar scale.

Will Lowe et al.\nillustrate by comparing them for a range of values across almost any\nscale. Notably, q (R) has a problem of reaching its limits for the\nextremes when L > 0, R = 0 or R > 0, L = 0. While the problem with\nq (S ) is that it registers linear changes with each additional extreme-\ncoded text unit in such situations, q (R) registers no changes at all.\nHence, a manifesto registering five exclusively left text units would be\nthe same as one registering 500. To demonstrate this using the CMP\ndata, Figure 1 plots the relative proportional difference versus the\n\u201csaliency\u201d scalings of the confrontational pair for \u201cNational Way of\nLife: Positive\/Negative\u201d (categories 601 and 602). The vertically\nstacked points at the limits of the scale (at -1.0 and 1.0) show that\nadditional mentions cause linear increases for the saliency scale, but\nno change for the relative proportional difference measure.\nSeveral other problems with the existing scales also emerge\nfrom an inspection of Figure 1. First, because mentions of \u201cnational\nway of life\u201d are relatively low in absolute frequency across manifes-\ntos, and because (R - L)\/N \u0003 (R + L)\/N, the low frequency of these\nstatements relative to all other statements severely shrinks q (S )\ntoward zero. The saliency measure is insensitive to changes for\npolicy dimensions with low absolute frequency and misleadingly\nassigns a difference score close to the zero point. While we have\nshown this here for only the national way of life categories 601 and\n602, it also applies to the CMP\u2019s biggest scale, Rile, encompassing\nFIGURE 1\nComparing the Relative Proportional Difference to the Saliency\nScale for \u201cNational Way of Life\u201d (categories 601 and 602)\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n-0\n.2\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\nRelative Proportional Difference\nS\nal\nie\nnc\ny\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 141\n26 categories in all. While in theory this scale runs from -1.0 to 1.0\n(as a proportion), in practice the range spans only from -.5 to .5 for\nalmost every manifesto measured.\nA second problem, again with q (S ) can be seen at the extremes\ndefined as L > 0, R = 0 for a left extreme, or R > 0, L = 0 for a\nright extreme. Extremity on the saliency measure q (S ) increases at a\nlinear rate with each additional text unit in the extreme category.\nSubstantively, the suggestion is that the same change occurs when the\nextreme-only category text units increase from 5 to 10 units, as when\nit increases from 105 to 100 units. This assumption of linear change\nin position given observed text unit counts is neither sensible nor\nsupported by perceptual theory (see our discussion of the Weber-\nFechner law above).\nFor each of these problems we have identified in q (S ), a corre-\nsponding problem can also be found in q (R). The middle-range problem\nof lack of sensitivity for q (S ) is exactly reversed in q (R): small differ-\nences between R and L become highly influential on q (R) when these\nare scaled as ratios of relative content R + L. An extreme example\nmakes the point: imagine a series of manifestos from a party that\nhad no real interest whatsoever in, and effectively no position on,\nprotectionism. Irrelevant stochastic factors in text generation, or in the\ncoding of the text, could plausibly result in a few essentially random\ncounts of text units into each of the protectionism categories. The\neffect on q (R) will be drastic in this situation, massively leveraging\nthe error because it is only concerned with relatively proportional\ncontent.\nIf we compare the overall distribution of data for one of our\ncomposite scales\u2014the environmental policy scale described above\u2014\nwe can see a fairly stark contrast between the spread of values\nfor different scales that reinforces the patterns we observed in exam-\nining the National Way of Life scale. In Figure 2, we compare the\ndistribution of scores for \u201cPER501 Environmental Protection: Posi-\ntive\u201d to a \u201cconfrontational\u201d scale constructed from opposing catego-\nries. Our new scale of environmental protection is based on adding\nthe two proenvironmental categories \u201cAntigrowth Economy: Posi-\ntive\u201d (PER416) and \u201cEnvironmental Protection: Positive\u201d (PER501)\nas capturing antigrowth politics and \u201cecologism\u201d and contrasting this\nwith the environmentally opposed paradigm of economic growth,\nrepresented in the CMP by the category \u201cProductivity: Positive\u201d\n(PER410). Figure 2 not only shows the better dispersion of the logit\nscale, but also demonstrates anew the problems we have already\nseen: bunching around zero of the saliency scale, as well as the\n142 Will Lowe et al.\nFIGURE 2\nDistributions of Scales for Proposed Environmental Scales\nPER501 Scores\nD\nen\nsi\nty\n0 20 40 60\n0.\n0\n0.\n2\n0.\n4\nSaliency \"Confrontational\" Environmental Scores\nD\nen\nsi\nty\n-0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nRelative Proportional Difference \"Confrontational\" Environmental Scores\nD\nen\nsi\nty\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n0\n4\n8\n12\nLogit \"Confrontational\" Environmental Score\nD\nen\nsi\nty\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6\n0.\n00\n0.\n15\n0.\n30\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 143\nbunching around the extremes of the relative proportional difference\nscale.\nComparisons to Expert Surveys of Policy\nUp to this point we have only compared one scale with another.\nTo judge more conclusively whether a particular scale measures what\nwe hope it measures, we can compare the CMP-based scales to inde-\npendent, external measures of party positions based on expert surveys.\nExpert surveys such as Benoit and Laver (2006) have been shown to\nprovide valid and reliable measures of party policy positions, but\nexisting measures are limited in their time frame to the two decades\nsince 1990. Only text-based measures such as the CMP have the\npotential to provide valid estimates of policy positions going further\nback in time. Limited comparisons of expert survey estimates to CMP\nmeasures were conducted by Benoit and Laver (2007), who tested\nthe saliency-based Rile measures against expert survey ratings of\nleft-right from Benoit and Laver (2006) and found a high correlation\nand lack of bias between the two measures. Because the large number\nof categories tends to wash out differences in large additive indexes\nsuch as Rile, here we perform the same comparison using smaller,\nmore policy-specific scales.\nWe have compared the CMP-based indexes to the Benoit and\nLaver (2006) expert survey estimates of party position on the issue of\nsocial liberalism, one of two fundamental axes of political competition\n(the other being economic left-right) on which they place parties in\nevery country. Some variant of this noneconomic dimension has been\nidentified as a distinct, basic axis of political competition in numerous\nstudies (e.g., Inglehart 1984; Marks, Wilson, and Ray 2002). Figure 3\nplots the Benoit and Laver social liberalism dimension scores against\neach of the three scales based on counts of \u201c604\/603 Traditional\nMorality: Negative\/Positive.\u201d\nThe patterns from the plots are consistent with the interscale\ncomparisons examined earlier. The saliency scale is highly bunched\naround zero, suppressing variation even when huge differences are\nidentified by the Benoit and Laver scores. The relative proportional\nscale in the middle panel shows spotty variation in the middle\nranges, with a very high proportion of values at the right side where\nBenoit and Laver indicate a complete range of differences but the\nrelative proportional scale has reached its maximum value. Finally,\nthe logit scale looks approximately linear, has no bunching at the\nextremes, or dispersed points in the middle. Its scale is centred to\n144 Will Lowe et al.\nFIGURE 3\nComparison of CMP Scales of Traditional Morality with Benoit and\nLaver (2006) Social Liberalism Dimension\n-0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n5\n10\n15\n20\nSaliency Scale\nB\nen\noi\nt-\nLa\nve\nr \nS\noc\nia\nl D\nim\nen\nsi\non\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nRelative Proportional Scale\nB\nen\noi\nt-\nLa\nve\nr \nS\noc\nia\nl D\nim\nen\nsi\non\n-4 -2 0 2 4 6\n5\n10\n15\n20\nLogit Scale\nB\nen\noi\nt-\nLa\nve\nr \nS\noc\nia\nl D\nim\nen\nsi\non\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 145\nthe right of zero, reflecting the higher proportion of text units of\n\u201cTraditional Morality: Positive\u201d (and many exclusively so), but\nthis does not perturb the scale\u2019s linear relationship with the expert\nsurvey scores. Residual analysis suggests that the relationship\nbetween expert survey scores and q (L) are both linear and\nhomoskedastic.15\nFinally, we perform the comparison with one of our simple\nadditive scales that is not strictly constructed from a bipolar pair.\nThis is the dimension of environmental protection, where the \u201cleft\u201d\nside has two components. This is also an interesting category for\ncomparison since, as previously discussed, the CMP\u2019s saliency\napproach identifies only one possible side to this issue. In Figure 4\nwe compare the CMP\u2019s default single-category scale of 501, to the\nrelative absolute proportional difference scale constructed as per\nTable 3, and to the corresponding logit scale. The two versions of the\nsaliency scale (per501 and the difference scale we have proposed)\nare not particularly poor, although 501 is clearly bounded to be posi-\ntive, with several values where the zero boundary suggests antienvi-\nronmental policies when in fact the party said nothing at all about\nthe environment. The saliency difference scale (middle plot) is left-\nskewed with some extreme proenvironmental values skewing the\npattern. The new scale (bottom plot), however, shows a much better\nbehaved linear relationship with the Benoit and Laver scores,\nwithout the skew from the saliency or relative proportional differ-\nence plots. The logit scale suggests the more sensible conclusion that\na manifesto containing 40% proenvironmental sentences is not 10\ntimes more proenvironment than a manifesto with just 5%, but rather\nonly about 2.3 times more. And by comparison to the one-sided\npolicy issue approach suggested by pure saliency theory, the com-\nparison in Figure 4 also reinforces our earlier argument that even\nseemingly one-sided issues perform better when recast in terms of\nconfrontationally opposite categories.\nAs a final form of external validation, we also compare our\nsuggested importance scale to the separately measured policy impor-\ntance estimates from Benoit and Laver (2006). These are plotted, for\nfour directly comparable measures, in Figure 5. The positive linear\nrelationship for these scales suggests that the proposed measure of\nimportance based on total mentions on either side of an issue do\nindeed form a valid indicator of the political importance of this issue\nto a party. Our proposed importance measure provides a scale for\nimportance that is more valid linguistically, based on logarithmically\nincreasing extremity. It also unlocks a general measure of importance\n146 Will Lowe et al.\nFIGURE 4\nComparison of CMP Scale of Environment with Benoit and Laver\n(2006) Environmental Dimension\n0 10 20 30\n5\n10\n15\nSimple PER501\n21\n -\n d\n2$\nM\nea\nnP\nos\nB\nLe\nnv\nir\n-1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n5\n10\n15\nRelative Proportional (R=per501+per416, L=per410)\nB\nen\noi\nt-\nLa\nve\nr \nE\nnv\niro\nnm\nen\nta\nl D\nim\nen\nsi\non\n-6 -4 -2 0 2\n5\n10\n15\nLogit (R=per501+per416, L=per410)\nB\nen\noi\nt-\nLa\nve\nr \nE\nnv\niro\nnm\nen\nta\nl D\nim\nen\nsi\non\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 147\nfrom the CMP data that has never before been made systematically\navailable.\nRecommendations\nBy focusing attention on producing better measures of party\npolicy positions over time, as well as introducing new measures of\nparty policy, our study should contribute to new developments in the\nfield of legislative studies, especially the study of legislatures in mul-\ntiparty settings.

This need for data becomes all the more\ninteresting at the party level in contexts with multiparty governments,\ncoalitions, and high party discipline.\nOur conclusions can be summarized as follows. First, our\nanalysis of the use of the logit scale to estimate left-right positions\nfrom counts of textual categories, as well as our demonstration\nthrough direct comparison to other scales as well as to independent\nexternal data, suggests that the logit scale is superior and should\nbe used in place of the \u201csaliency\u201d and \u201crelative proportional\ndifference\u201d approaches used previously. We recommend using the\nlogit scale for all policy categories and have provided a set of\n21 such scales (in Tables 1 and 3) that can be constructed directly\nfrom the existing CMP dataset. In addition, we have calculated\nuncertainty estimates for all quantities using the simulation method\nproposed by Benoit, Laver, and Mikhaylov (2009). This dataset is\navailable immediately and offers a superior alternative to the esti-\nmates supplied by the CMP, estimates that we have shown are based\non the inferior saliency-based scales, and with few exceptions not\nconstructed in the confrontational pairing approach we recommend\nhere.\nSecond, we have proposed a new and separate measure of policy\nimportance that is consistent with our logit scale of position and\ndemonstrated that this proposed scale correlates well with indepen-\ndent, external measures of policy importance from expert surveys.\nThese importance estimates are also provided with accompanying\nuncertainty measures.\nFinally, we have shown that the assumption that individual\nparties take only one side, and indeed that all parties take the same\nside, of an issue, is demonstrably false, even given the CMP\u2019s own\ndataset. For our purposes, this implies a critique of the basic CMP\ncoding scheme, since the existing scheme consists of a mixture of\nconfrontational and saliency-based categories. Our analysis suggests\nthat any revision of the coding scheme would complete the step toward\na fully confrontational coding scheme, consisting only of opposing,\npro and contra categories. It would also be possible to go one step\nfurther and include a neutral category for each confrontational policy\nscale, which could be ignored when computing q (L) but counted when\nconsidering q (I ). This would address the concerns of McDonald and\nMendes (2001b) about the nonreflection of neutral stances in the\npositional scales, as well as better reflecting overall policy importance\nbased on counting text units.\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 149\nWill Lowe <w.lowe@maastrichtuniversity.nl> is Assistant Profes-\nsor in Research Methods, Department of Political Science, Maastrich\nUniversity, P.O.

The dataset contains all of the\nvariables described in Tables 1 and 3, with suffixes indicating whether\nthe variable refers to position, the 95% confidence interval on position,\nthe estimate of importance, and the standard errors of position and\nimportance. For the variable protectionism (for example), the five\nassociated variables are:\nprotectionism position estimate\nprotectionism_lo95 95% lower bound for position estimate\nprotectionism_hi95 95% upper bound for position estimate\nprotectionism_SE standard error for position estimate\nprotectionism_imp importance estimate\nprotectionism_impSE standard error for importance estimate\nNOTES\nThis paper was originally prepared for presentation at the 2008 ECPR General\nConference, Potsdam. We thank Thomas D\u00e4ubler and Jonathan Slapin for comments\non multiple drafts of this manuscript. This research was supported in part by the Irish\nResearch Council for Humanities and the Social Sciences.\n1. Details may be found in Table 3. We return to this scale later in the\ntext.\n2. For the initial development we treat each policy area as defined by one \u201cleft\u201d\nand one \u201cright\u201d CMP category. In fact neutral categories are also possible, and in some\ncases it is helpful to aggregate more than one CMP category to generate a substan-\ntively appropriate left of right count.\n150 Will Lowe et al.\n3. More precisely, the CMP\u2019s saliency-based scale multiplies q by 100 to\nallow interpretation as a percentage.\n4. The percentage of uncodeable content in the average manifesto in the CMP\ncombined dataset is 6.8%, making the inclusion of uncoded content a real worry for\nmany texts.\n5. More complex nonlinear marginal effects that decrease the effect of early as\nwell as later mentions have long been suggested (e.g., Jakobovits and Lambert 1963;\nJakobovits and Hogenraad 1967) and are intuitively reasonable for manifesto data,\nperhaps as part of an interaction with issue salience. Investigating this relationship is\nfurther work.\n6. Later research (Stevens 1957) has established a range of power law rela-\ntionships between physical and subjective magnitudes in different modalities, not all\nof which exhibit decreasing marginal effects. Nevertheless we work here with the\nlogarithmic relationship because of its simplicity, its linguistic motivation as sketched\nabove, and most importantly, its excellent fit to policy positions generated indepen-\ndently by experts, considered below.\n7. The scale is given units by reference to a barely perceptible reference\nsound.\n8. In practice, however, the logit scales applied to the CMP data ranges from\napproximately -7 to +7, since few R or L categories (or indeed, N) tend to exceed\nlog(1000) = 6.9.\n9. In applications we follow standard statistical practice in the analysis of\ncontingency tables and add 0.5 to L and R, (Agresti 1996). This can be motivated as\na means to reduce estimation bias (Firth 1993) or to provide better behaved interval\nmeasures of uncertainty (Brown, Cai, and DasGupta 2001).\n10. Statistical latent variable modelers (e.g., Clinton, Jackman, and Rivers\n2004; Slapin and Proksch 2008) make the same observation by noting that the zero\npoint, direction, and units of the measurements are model identification constraints not\nsubstantive assertions about position.\n11. In the framework of parametric models, q (L) could be seen as subpart of\na multinomial logistic regression model of the category counts [R, L, N - (R + L)]\nin party platform, where N - (R + L) is the number of sentences assigned to other\ncategories or left uncoded. Using L as a base category, q (L) will, as N increases,\napproximate the first linear predictor in such a model.\n12. In the saliency theory approach, policy dimensions are assumed to consist\nof issue areas or clusters of issues (Robertson 1976, 61).\n13. In Danish: \u201cMilj\u00f8politikken [environmental policy] m\u00e5ikke stille danske\nvirksomheder d\u00e5rligere, end virksomhederne i de lande vi konkurrerer med\u201d (Venstre\nManifesto 1988). We thank Jacob Rathlev for this suggestion and Martin Hansen for\ndrawing attention to this example and for help with the translation.\n14. This reflects the definition of one of the core four dimensions in the expert\nsurvey in Benoit and Laver (2006, 129).\n15. Similar patterns are easily observed for numerous other scales, such as\nMulticulturalism: Positive\/Negative against the Benoit and Laver scores for national-\nism and immigration.\nScaling Policy Preferences from Coded Political Texts 151\nREFERENCES\nAgresti, A. 1996.
