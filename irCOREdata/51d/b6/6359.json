However, much of what has been written has concentrated on the features of\nthe medium that make it suitable for distance learning; there has been less written about\nthe influence of these features on campus-based courses. This paper presents a case study\nwhich explores this particular problem, and which questions received wisdom about some\nof the claims that the pedagogic features of Web-based learning are desirable for learners.\nFirstly, however, the literature on campus-based open learning, and on the use of the Web\nto support dental education (which forms the focus for this study) will be reviewed.\n51\nRuth Holt Martin Oliver and Oaire McAvinia Using Web-based support for campus-based open learning\nBackground\nWeb-based support for campus-based open learning\nThe use of Web-based resources to support learners at a distance has been widely\ninvestigated in recent years, with many authors describing the benefits that it can bring.\nSuch benefits include increased flexibility for learners (Nikolova and Collis, 1998), its\nability to support discussion (Nixon and Salmon, 1996) and its wider benefit for the\ninstitutions involved in terms of student recruitment (Hanna, 1998).\nWhilst some of the benefits that apply to distance learning will also accrue for students\nbased at traditional institutions, it would be naive to assume that all will apply, or that they\nwill all result in the same patterns of student engagement. However, the particular features\nof this niche form of Web-based support remain ignored; even substantial investigations\nhave grouped campus-based open learners alongside their distance counterparts as a\ncontrast to students in traditional classes (for example, Hiltz, Coppola, Rotter, Turoff and\nBenunan-Fich, 2000).\nTo date, much of the research on the use of Web-based support for campus-based courses\nhas concentrated on the implementation of systems (for example, Shaikh and Macaulay,\n2001), or has focused on the results of a particular case study. Few have attempted to draw\nout the wider implications of these for the design of Web-based support for open learning\non campus, although there are some notable exceptions (such as Boyle and Cook, 2001). In\npart, such caution is entirely appropriate, given the problems of generalizing from case\nstudies of educational impact (Oliver, 2000). However, one valuable way in which case\nstudies can contribute to our general understanding of an area is by challenging received\nwisdom through the provision of counter-examples. There is thus a need to reconsider\nsome of the benefits traditionally associated with online learning in the context of campus-\nbased open learning.\nUse of the Web in dental education\nComputer-assisted learning has been used as a part of undergraduate teaching in dentistry,\nbut is perhaps more often seen as a resource suitable for postgraduate training.\nImportantly, software packages (such as CD-Roms) still seem to be the dominant form of\ncomputer-assisted learning in this area, with current research in dental education still\ncoming to terms with now-familiar issues in learning technology research such as the\nreluctance of students to lose contact with their tutors and the difficulties of moving\nbeyond affective responses to consider actual changes to learning (see, for example,\nLechner, Thomas, Bradshaw and Lechner, 2001; Welbury, Hobson, Stephenson and\nJepson, 2001). However, Web-based courses are now being introduced for Continuing\nProfessional Development (CPD) purposes - an area that is growing in importance for\ndental professionals (Grigg and Stephens, 1998). This is, perhaps, unsurprising given the\npedagogic relevance of Web-based courses for learners in work (Bradley and Oliver, 2002).\nOne reason for the relatively low level of uptake is that the value of such approaches has\nbeen called into question for certain key topics such as clinical decision-making skills (for\nexample, Kay, Silkstone and Worthington, 2001). Consequently, many educators in this\nfield remain in doubt about the viability of Web-based approaches to teaching.\n52\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nThe context for this study\nAgainst this backdrop, a decision was made to redevelop a programme in Dental Public\nHealth for the M.Sc. of the University of London and the Diploma of the Royal College\nof Surgeons. Traditionally, this had been delivered through a one-year, full-time\nprogramme involving traditional face-to-face teaching methods. Cohorts included UK and\noverseas graduates; there are usually around equal numbers of each on the course. In\nrecent years cohorts have been small, rarely growing larger than ten students.\nThe prospect of a partnership with an overseas institution led to questions about how the\ncourse could be redeveloped to support distance students. A distance-learning version of\nthe course was available, but was not Web-based; rather than relying on this, it was decided\nthat the potential partnership presented an opportunity to explore whether a Web-based\nformat would be appropriate for this course.\nThis exploration was carried out by piloting a Web-based approach to teaching and\nlearning on two modules of the course. The modules were delivered using WebCT, which is\nthe institution's supported Virtual Learning Environment software. In order to ensure that\nthe inferences drawn from this pilot were appropriate for the target group of students, the\npilot was carried out by offering the course to students currently studying on the\ntraditionally taught master's degree. As a result, the students who participated in the pilot\nused a Web-based course to support what was, for them, a campus-based education.\nThe course that was developed drew on many of the standard features of WebCT, and the\ninitial module made use of Web pages, bulletin boards, assessment facilities (multiple\nchoice, answer matching, etc.), essay submission and administration facilities, reference\nmanagement resources, and so on.\nThe students on the course were unfamiliar with WebCT, and so an introductory page was\ndeveloped (Figure 1) that introduced students to all of the features of the environment that\nthey would need to use during the course. Students worked through this, with tutor\nsupport, as part of an initial face-to-face workshop, and the materials remained available\nfrom the course home page as a point of reference.\nGetting started with the Dental Public Health course\nWhat this document is fir\nThis documentwelcomesyoutothe course, tells you about WebCT and contains some exercises to\nhelp you gain confidence with working in WebCT. It will probably take you 30-60 tninutes to work\nthrough it. Start by reading from the top, attempting the exercises as you go.\nRemember that this document has been opened in a new window. This means that you can swap\nbetween this document and WebCT easily, without having to close either of them. This should help you\nwhen you're trying to follow the instructions for the exercises. .__\nYou have now arrived at the very first module of our course in Dental Public Health! Our course\nhas been developed jointly by the Eastman Dental Institute and Education and Professional\nDevelopment of University College, London and represents a new venture in the subject. For the\nFigure I: An excerpt from the introductory materials for the course\n\" S3\nRuth Holt Martin Oliver and Claire McAvinio Using Web-based support for campus-based open learning\nIn addition to the materials and resources provided for the students, collaboration and\ndiscussion was encouraged. Structured discussion areas were set up, where students were\nasked to post answers to questions, to discuss other students' responses, and were\nencouraged to ask questions of the tutor and each other. Several assessment features were\nused, including formative self-assessment and assignment management. From an early\nstage in the design process, it became apparent that the use of WebCT could support\npedagogic approaches that were novel for this particular course, such as the introduction of\ninteractive assignments, which involved making judgements about images (for example,\nFigure 2) and analysing the resulting data using spreadsheets. These assignments closely\nresemble authentic problems facing practitioners.\nLook at the first two sets of bitewing films and the completed example spreadsheet to make\nsure that you understand exactly what to do and how to enter your scores on the worksheet.\n(To look at the example spreadsheet, go to Excel, and click on the tab at the bottom of the\npage that says, \"example\". This contains a worked example for the two set of bitewing films\nshown in the table below.) You may find it helpful to print this page off so that it is easier to\ncompare the images with the numbers in the spreadsheet.\nFigure 2: An image and excerpt from the assessment on judging bitewing radiographs\nAnother important development was the introduction of self-assessment activities in the\nsecond module. This reflects wider concerns within the field about practitioners' ability to\nassess their own ability, and the relevance of training students in self-assessment skills as a\nvital component of CPD (see, for example, Evans, 2001). The students developed criteria\nfor self-assessment at a second face-to-face session, based on their analysis of the strengths\nand weaknesses of a pre-prepared 'bad practice' document. Students were then asked to\napply these criteria to their own work, in order to assess their own strengths and\nweaknesses and to grade their performance.\nCase study methodology\nTo evaluate the pilot, several sources of data were considered. These included direct\nobservation of students, monitoring their use of resources and participation in discussions\nusing WebCTs student tracking facilities, and, most importantly, a focus group and\ninterview. This range reflected both the small number of students on the course (three,\ntogether with additional participants who volunteered to be involved but were not formally\nassessed) and the emphasis on understanding students' experiences through considering\nboth their accounts and our perceptions of the course. These data were analysed following\nthe procedures described by Kvale (1996) for ad hoc meaning generation.\n\u2014\nAn-] Volume 10 Number 2\nResults and discussion\nFour main issues arose from this study: assessment, experiences of self-assessment, the role\nof flexibility and online discussion. Each of these will be considered in turn, and will be\nillustrated by quotes from the focus group and interview with the students.\nAssessment issues\nIt was clear from tracking usage of WebCT, and from comments in the focus group, that\nthe students were assessment-driven. This is hardly a surprising finding, echoing as it does\nother work on assessment (see, for example, the discussion of 'backwash' from assessment\nin Biggs, 1999). However, the small cohort permitted a detailed level of observation and\ndiscussion that allowed the implications of this to become clear, revealing some important\nfeatures of the students' engagement with the course.\nThe direct implication of the influence of assessment was that non-assessed activities were\nneglected, and time was allocated to work in proportion to its perceived status as\ncontributing towards a final score.\nWith [this activity] having formal assessment assignments, deadlines and marking, you\nwill almost instinctively give it a higher priority than you will other areas, because that is\nthe way we have been brought up and educated.\nAlthough they were assessment-driven, they did not particularly like being assessed.\nHowever, they saw it as being vital to their learning process - not because of the feedback\nthat they received (although they did recognize the value of this) but simply because it\nforced them to engage with the material they otherwise used superficially.\nI think, to be frank, who likes to do the assignment? Who likes to do the deadline? You\nhave to submit this assignment by the end of December, January. In the learning\nprocess, you have to do . . . you have to do the assignment, and by then only you learn,\nyou learn something. So I think the assignment is very beneficial, because it makes you\nt o . . . it pushes you to do something, rather than [the alternative where] you are just left\nto do your own reading. Because I think you won't do [the reading] until the end of\ncourse when the exam comes.\nThis lack of engagement was systematic; it was not merely a symptom of this particular\ncourse. For the students, their various lecturers' use of assessment represented an important\nuse of power that coerced them into committing time and effort to particular topics.\nI can get away with not doing the background reading for lecture X because I'm not\nlikely to be found out. I can cover it. But if the assignment's not in by the computer\ntime, then it's just black and white, isn't it. It's either there or it's not there. I think if\nyou're going to put in something that's not covered anywhere else, then just by the\nstructure of this, or the weighting of the grading of the other areas, you will ensure that\nwe do that.\nAlthough students discussed the competing demands of different parallel modules on their\ntime, they made it clear that such coercion led primarily to the sacrifice of leisure time.\nI think the answer for us is, we like assignments because it keeps us thinking, or it makes\nus think about this course rather than going down the pub tonight.\n\u2014\nRuth Hoh. Martin Oliver and Claire McAvinia Using Web-based support for campus-based open learning\nThese responses seem to paint a cynical, calculating picture of the student experience.\nHowever, drawing on Bourdieu's notion of different forms of capital (1986), they can be\ninterpreted instead as representing a rational expenditure of precious personal capital -\ntheir time - in order to gain the maximum symbolic capital (qualifications and grades) in\nreturn for their investment.\nStudents' experience of self-assessment\nFurther assessment-related issues arose from the self-assessment exercise described above,\nwhich the students found to be extremely difficult. The creation of criteria for assessment\nwas the first indication of the students' difficulties. As a group, the students were able to\ngenerate and agree criteria against which their work should be judged. However, they were\nnot able to agree on the relative weightings each of these should be given. The weightings\nthey chose for each group of criteria (layout, quality of analysis and use of evidence)\nappeared to reflect their understanding of the purpose of assessment, and so will be\noutlined briefly, under the headings suggested by the students as a rationale for their\nallocations.\nRationale for allocation of marks Layout Quality Use of evidence\n'Substance not spin' 24 38 38\nVolume\/length - rewarding effort' 35 35 30\n'Masochism as motivation' 40 30 30\nTable I: Students' percentage mark weightings for the three categories of criteria\nThe first student weighted the marking scheme heavily towards the thoroughness and\nvalidity of the analysis, attributing relatively low importance to the structure and\npresentation of the documentation. (The weight he was willing to attach to this category\narose almost exclusively from the need for a well-structured document.) This student\ndefended his allocation on the basis that, if this were a real report for use in dental public\nhealth, the reliability of decisions based upon it would depend solely on the quality of the\nanalysis.\nThe second student spread the marks evenly across the three areas. She argued that this\nwas fairer than over-emphasizing any one area, since a clever student who made no effort\nwould score highly if analysis was allocated most of the marks. She explained that a\nrecognition of effort, rather than an arbitrary measure of quality, was the most\nappropriate way to reward students. Implicit in this is a positive motivational model of the\nrole of assessment, encouraging those who try hard to greater lengths.\nThe third student adopted a different scheme again, placing the greatest emphasis on\nlayout and then evenly dividing the remaining marks. This would force him to take this\naspect of his work - which he knew that he was weak at - more seriously, he explained. He\ndescribed this as a 'punishment' and even a 'masochistic' model of assessment, intended as\na deterrent to laziness.\nAfter discussing these different models, the third student agreed that his mark scheme was\ntoo personal to be appropriate for everyone in the group. (This illustrates another\nimportant distinction between the three; he viewed an ideal assessment scheme as being\n56\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\ntailored to the individual being assessed, whilst the second believed that the allocation of\nmarks should be tailored to the students' ability and the first felt that marks represented an\nobjective set of criteria.) He was willing to adopt the mark scheme of the second student,\nbut not the essentially positivist scheme of the first student. Similarly, the first student\nrefused to accept the appropriateness of the other two mark schemes on grounds of\nvalidity. Consequently, it was agreed that each student should use all three mark schemes\nto grade their work, as would the course tutor, and that marks would be compared both\nacross schemes and across markers in order to enquire into the ways in which these\ndifferent value systems rewarded the same piece of work.\nEventually, however, only one of the students completed this process. The first student,\nrefusing to accept that he (or any other non-expert) could validly mark the assignment, opted\nout of the exercise completely. The second student prepared a qualitative assessment of her\nwork (which the tutor agreed was insightful and appropriate) but said that she felt it was\ninappropriate to award herself marks using any of the schemes. Although the third student\ncompleted the exercise, he said that he did not take the marks he had given himself par-\nticularly seriously. Interestingly, in spite of difficulties of grading, both the second and third\nstudents felt that the qualitative element of the self-assessment had been extremely valuable.\nClearly, the problem that arose in this case was not one of understanding or ability, but was\ninstead a cultural issue. Because this form of assessment places the responsibility for\ndevising marking criteria and judging work with the student, it represents a radical\nchallenge to traditional forms of power and hierarchy in education (Rowland, 1993:\n136-40). Such a challenge left the students feeling uneasy. Although they were all capable\nof completing the process, they could not accept it as an appropriate part of their course\ngiven their previous experiences of education. In effect, engagement in such self-evaluative\nactivity simply was not part of the students' habitus (Bourdieu, 1977). This suggests that\nattempts to introduce techniques such as self-assessment will need to take careful account\nof students' educational histories. It may be necessary to build up to the introduction of\nsuch an unfamiliar technique using less radical methods first in order to bridge the cultural\ngap between past experience and the desired form of learning.\nFlexibility\nAs outlined above, the importance of flexibility in the literature suggests that it would have\na beneficial effect for learners. The course described here did make studying more flexible;\nfor example, students used WebCT to access course materials from home, and from other\nsites, and at a range of times outside scheduled teaching hours. This helped balance the\nworkload for the module against other course commitments.\nHowever, flexibility was not a straightforward virtue. Firstly, although students valued the\npotential of WebCT'to support flexible study, they did not necessarily use it in this way.\nFrom my point of view, it's got to be [flexible] - that's a big bonus. Particularly if you're\ntravelling. But on a practical level I've only accessed it when I'm in here. I mean, it still\nallows me some flexibility, I can do it when I've got a moment. I really should be doing\nit, for the sake of coming in.\nIn fact, being able to do work 'when I've got a moment' was a problem for two of the three\nstudents, who would have preferred scheduled sessions:\n57\nRuth Holt, Martin Oliver and Claire McAvinia Using Web-based support for campus-based open learning\n1: I think if we have a proper session for the WebCT, if we have [this], then we have, we\ncan . . . [pauses] If we can do it whenever we are free, then some . . . we keep on doing\nsomething else rather than doing WebCT. So if we have a proper class for WebCT I\nthink it's a bit better.\n2: Yes, it's better at pushing you, you know. Do it, do it!\n1: Yeah. You have to do it. [laughs]\nWith all three students, increasingly flexibility led to work being put off, which they\nacknowledged would cause problems in the longer term. Assessment was seen as being\nparticularly important as a way of counteracting this tendency.\nI personally prefer to be kicked up the backside to do something continually because\nthen I know by the end I'll have done it. Whereas most of us, out of human nature,\nwould say, I don't have to do that now. And then you get into a mad panic come June or\nwhatever.\nEven with assignments, however, observation and discussion with the students showed that no\nmatter how long the lead-time the work was completed as close to the deadline as possible.\nWhat these experiences illustrate is that there is a need for a balance between flexibility and\nstructure in courses, that this may be difficult to achieve, and that it will vary according to\nthe needs of individual students.\nOnline discussions\nIn spite of drawing on a range of guidelines for practice (such as Salmon, 2000), online\ndiscussions did not work well. The students felt that the structured format reduced the\nexchanges to a transmission of information.\nYou know, there isn't enough discussion that goes on. There's too much . . . sometimes,\nyou know, we might as well just have a handout.\nThe students did acknowledge that this was, at least in part, a consequence of their own\nchoices.\nI mean, the opportunity to discuss is there, but we as students don't always take up that\nchallenge perhaps.\nIn part, they viewed this as a consequence of the fact that their contributions to the\ndiscussion board were unassessed, and thus were viewed as being optional.\nThat's why you see our postings up for these things is much poorer than the\nassignments. If they are not graded. Yes, they are important, it's just that a lot of\nimportant points there, and you have to follow it up, but it's not graded, so . . . [pause;\nlaughs]. That's the point of view, you know. You just put it as something for when you\nhave time, and you want to have some fun, you have the mood to do it.\nAnother reason for this choice was that they felt that online discussion was inferior to face-\nto-face exchanges:\nI don't think it's the best way to discuss matters, I prefer to do it around a table. You see\nthe answer that much quicker coming back, you get more from it, and if you don't\n58\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 2\nunderstand something you can ask directly. That's my point. I don't see that as a\nstrength of WebCT.\nI don't use it for discussion. I just don't. I use it for the learning tools, like the\nassignments. If I want to discuss, then I'll do it in here, because you get so much more\nout of it. It's a barrier for me to discuss something like that.\nGiven that this was a hybrid course it was simply easier and better to discuss issues when\nthey met. However, they agreed that such discussion was better than nothing.\nI think that if it's the only option you've got for discussion then it is better than none at\nall, but as a replacement for sitting around a table, I think it's got a long way to go.\nI described it as a barrier because it's a barrier as opposed to just doing this sort of\nconversation. But it's a facilitator if there's no other way of conversing, isn't it. It just\ndepends on what standpoint you're looking at it, and I'm absolutely, you know, sure that\ngiven the alternative between only having a once a month visit to your tutor and having\nthe opportunity to communicate through a fairly instantaneous medium then that is a\nstep in the right direction. But I don't think it replaces sitting round and discussing it in\na group.\nImportantly, this reaction against the online discussions seemed to represent an exercise of\npower by one of the students. Of the three, the second and third (as described in the section\non self-assessment) had contributed sporadically to the online discussions. In particular,\nthe second student had posted several long, thoughtful messages. This contrasted sharply\nwith her more hesitant, infrequent contributions in the face-to-face discussion. She\nexplained that this was because she was able to reflect before writing, and was able\ncarefully to compose and revise messages before sending them. This was something that\nshe felt to be of great value given that English was not her first language.\nBy way of contrast, the first student had avoided the online discussions wherever possible.\nHe dominated traditional group discussions, partly because of his quick wit, but also\nbecause he was more fluent and articulate than the other two students. (He was the only\none of the three for whom English was the first language.) He identified his dyslexia (which\nhe had previously kept hidden from the group and the tutor) as one particular reason for\npreferring to speak than to write. Thus the face-to-face discussions reinforced his position\nof control in the group, whereas the online discussions allowed the other two students -\nand particularly student two - to overshadow him.\nIt would be naive to argue, on the basis of this case, that moving discussions online will\nthus eradicate or even diminish power structures within groups. However, what this study\nvividly illustrates is that such a move will change these structures in ways that are\ninfluenced by personality, background and fluency in writing and speech. As a result, these\ncharacteristics are also likely to inform students' preferences for (and the potential success\nof) a particular medium for discussion.\nOther issues\nIn addition to these main themes, several other points were noted. Firstly, although\nstudents found some elements of WebCT frustrating, overall they were satisfied with their\nuse of it.\n59\nRuth Holt Martin Oliver and Gaire McAvinia Using Web-based support for campus-based open learning\nIt's not a problem - it's just that when you don't know something, it's so annoying that it\ntakes so long to work it o u t . . . You end up swearing at the screen, don't you, for some\nlittle thing like that.\nI think it's a pretty good sign for the system if between the three of us the only major\nconcern is a little glitch like the type of file that has to be submitted. I mean, it does\nsuggest that it's simple to use.\nMoreover, they valued the novelty of this approach.\nI think that WebCTis another way to add to the variety of the learning process.\nMethodologically, the focus group also highlighted the fact that logs of students' use of the\nsystem gives a flawed and partial account of their experience of the course, echoing the\nwarnings of Jones (1998).\nI tend to spend most of the time on the assignments. I tend to print the content anyway,\nso I've got a record of it.\nConclusions\nAt a superficial level, the study demonstrated the success of using WebCT to deliver\ncourses of this type. The students all completed the course, and were generally well\ndisposed towards the use of the Web to support their learning. However, closer\nexamination shows that the course design, which had been carefully based on\nrecommendations from the literature, caused a number of problems.\nWhat this study illustrates is that not all students are equally well suited to learning from\nWeb-based materials. Thus the success of any such approach will be influenced by\nstudents' personalities and educational history as much as by the design of the course. The\nwider implication of this is that courses should, ideally, reflect the characteristics of the\nindividual students on the course. The students described here (two non-native English\nspeakers, and one dyslexic student) were not 'typical' - but this is the point. No student is\n'typical', even if their distinctiveness is not initially obvious (as was the case here with the\ndyslexic student); each will bring with them personal histories and dispositions that shape\ntheir interaction with the course, and will thus determine its effectiveness.\nIn effect, then, the idea of 'student-centred learning' should be moved from being simply a\nset of pedagogic strategies applied to all students, to being an integral part of course design\nduring which the suitability of all teaching methods, including those not traditionally\nconsidered to be student-centred, should be considered. Perhaps more insidiously, this\nconclusion also implies that, given the increasing diversity of students (even within the\ncontext of specific courses), it may be impossible to create any single course that is well\ndesigned for each and every student in a cohort.\nAlso linked to the issue of individual educational history were the problems associated\nwith the introduction of self-assessment. This was entirely new for the students on this\ncourse, and thus whilst it had the potential to provide considerable benefits, its success was\nlimited because it was unfamiliar and challenged deeply held assumptions about the way\neducation 'ought' to operate.\n60\nALT-] Volume 10 Number 2\nFlexibility, which is almost ubiquitously claimed as an advantage for courses involving the\nWeb, proved to be a mixed blessing. Although students spoke of the value of studying\nwhen they liked, they also admitted that the reality was that they typically accessed\nmaterials on campus, and organized their work around deadlines. Moreover, they indicated\nthat more, not less, structure to the course would have helped them use their time more\neffectively. Thus the potential of the Web to support 'any time, any place' learning became\nnot simply irrelevant but also detrimental to the students' management of their learning.\nThis would imply that the current advocacy for flexible courses may have gone too far in its\nattempts to address the dilemma of structure identified by Rowland (1993:45-6).\nThe study also echoed other research which has emphasized the centrality of assessment in\nstudents' perceptions of courses. Given that students organized their time around dead-\nlines, the number and pacing of assignments will create the structure of the course, at least\nin terms of student work.\nInherent in all of these issues is one common problem: students' commitment of time to a\ncourse comes at the expense of time which might otherwise be spent elsewhere. This\nobservation allows the often-criticized phenomenon of student instrumentalism to be\nreframed not as laziness or superficiality, but as a shrewd way of investing their personal\nresources (Bourdieu, 1986). It is only rational to avoid making any more effort than\nnecessary, by opting for the most familiar, convenient ways of completing the course. The\nshort-term planning witnessed here illustrates that a lack of clear course structure can add\nto, rather than diminish, this tendency to avoid committing time to the course, at least for\nthose students who do not find study intrinsically motivating.\nThis has significant implications for the kind of hybrid course described here. Where a\nWeb-based course is used to support campus-based education, students may well drop\nelements that they find difficult in favour of easier, more familiar options. Unless they feel\nan inherent motivation to explore and experience these new teaching methods, it will be\nnecessary to ensure that the innovative elements are either mandatory or easier for all the\nstudents involved.\nReferences\nBiggs, J.
