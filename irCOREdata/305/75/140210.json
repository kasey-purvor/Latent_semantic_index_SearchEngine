INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that materials behave in a significantly\ndifferent manner under high strain-rates\/pressures\u2014e.g.,\nshock loading\u2014compared to quasistatic\/low strain-rate con-\nditions. Material properties at elevated strain-rates may be\nexperimentally investigated using a variety of techniques.\nHowever, for strain-rates in the regime 106\u2013108 \/s the most\ncommon laboratory-scale approach is the plate-impact tech-\nnique. A useful summary of this approach together with com-\nparison to other high strain-rate deformation techniques is\nprovided by Field et al.;1 essentially, a launch system \u0002typi-\ncally a compressed-gas or explosively-driven gun\u0003 is used to\nimpact a target material with a projectile\/flyer plate at el-\nevated velocities\/pressures, imparting a shock wave into the\ntarget. During such experiments all surfaces perpendicular to\nthe impact axis are carefully kept flat\/parallel to a tolerance\nof \u00025 \u0003m. Under such conditions inertial confinement en-\nsures a one-dimensional \u00021D\u0003 shock in the center of the tar-\nget up until the point where release waves from either the\nflyer rear-surface or target edge catch up with the main\nshock.2,3 Consequently, careful design allows experiments to\nbe conducted entirely in a 1D state of strain. Shock propa-\ngation may be monitored via a variety of techniques includ-\ning interferometeric monitoring of the target rear surface and\ninsertion of embedded pressure gauges into the material flow.\nFive discrete parameters describe such a shock: shock veloc-\nity \u0002US\u0003; particle or mass velocity \u0002uP; the continuum veloc-\nity of the material behind the shock front\u0003; pressure \u0002equiva-\nlent to the longitudinal stress, \u0004X, established within the\nmaterial over the shock duration where material strength is\nnegligible\u0003; density, and; internal energy. However, these pa-\nrameters are linked by a series of conservation relations\nknown as the Rankine\u2013Hugoniot conservation equations.\nThese equations mean that a relationship between any two of\nthese parameters, known as a Hugoniot equation-of-state, is\nsufficient to uniquely define a shock.4\nIn plate-impact experiments longitudinal\n\u0002in-plane\/Hugoniot\u2014\u0004X\u0003 stress behavior behind a shock is\nnormally a function of the input pulse. For example, if a\nsquare-wave is introduced then a shock with a rectangular\nform will result. However, while plate-impacts are 1D, iner-\ntial confinement will lead to establishment of a lateral stress\n\u0002\u0004Y\u0003. Unlike the longitudinal stress case, measurements of\nlateral stress via encapsulated lateral manganin gauges often\nshow a change in gradient behind the shock.2,3,5\u201311 The es-\ntablished explanation for this phenomena is based on Eq. \u00021\u0003;\ni.e., that the change in gradient represents a change in shear\nstrength \u0002\u0005\u0003 behind the shock.2,3,5\u20139 Assuming constant \u0004X,\nany change in \u0004Y would, therefore, represent a change in \u0005;\ne.g., a decrease in \u0004Y would correspond to strengthening\nwithin the target. In most cases appropriate microstructural\nmechanisms are identified to explain any observed changes\nin strength. An increase in strength is often observed in poly-\nmeric materials and is typically linked to compression of\nlong-chain molecules.3 The converse effect, namely, an in-\ncrease in lateral stress\/a reduction in \u0005 \u0002weakening\u0003 behind\nthe shock has been observed in bcc materials. An example of\nweakening behavior behind the shock occurs in tungsten,\nwhere it was attributed to a combination of the impedance of\ndislocation formation, motion, and storage by a high Peierls\u2013\nNabarro stress in addition to initiation of cracks along grain\nboundaries.12\n\u0005 =\n\u0004X \u2212 \u0004Y\n2\n. \u00021\u0003\nAs an alternative, Winter and Harris10 and Winter et al.11\nsuggested that perceived changes in strength behind the\nshock might be linked to differential target and encapsulation\na\u0003Electronic mail: g.applebythomas@cranfield.ac.uk.\nb\u0003Also at Institute of Shock Physics, Royal School of Mines, Prince Consort\nRoad, Imperial College London, London, SW7 2BP, UK.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 108, 033524 \u00022010\u0003\n0021-8979\/2010\/108\u00033\u0002\/033524\/9\/$30.00 \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics108, 033524-1\nDownloaded 01 Sep 2010 to 193.63.247.68.

Shock propagation was simulated through\n\u0002a\u0003 a so-called matrix material \u0002the target\u0003 and \u0002b\u0003 a matrix\nmaterial with a central fluid layer representing an encapsu-\nlated gauge. This work showed significant modification of\nthe shock front due to different fluid layer\/matrix velocities.\nA faster shock velocity in the fluid layer led to a continual\nrise in lateral gauge stress following shock arrival. Con-\nversely, a faster matrix shock speed resulted in an initial\nramp to a peak \u0002possibly linked to the formation of a Mach\nstem behind the slower moving shock in the encapsulation\u0003\nfollowed by a steady decrease in magnitude behind the front.\nExperiments were conducted by Winter et al.11 on tantalum\nand steel targets with the aim of confirming this effect by\nmonitoring recession velocities during plate-impact tests\nboth on, and a finite distance from, the impact axis. The\ntargets employed sandwiched a lateral gauge encapsulation\nproxy \u0002a 100 \u0003m thick Mylar central layer\u0003. Observed sig-\nnificant differences in the recession velocities, predicted\nnumerically,10 were attributed to modification of the shock\nby the central encapsulation.\nBoth explanations for the observed behavior of lateral\ngauge traces seemed plausible. Consequently, a series of ex-\nperiments designed to investigate the effect of modification\nof the encapsulation layer on lateral stress were undertaken.\nRecent work involving lateral gauge encapsulation within the\ncommercially important resin transfer moulding \u0002RTM\u0003 6 ep-\noxy resin showed a gradient despite similar resin\/interlayer\nwave speeds.13 This suggested that lateral gauges appear to\ndetect genuine changes in material properties behind the\nshock.3 However, this work did not consider potential effects\nof a significant missmatch in target\/encapsulation imped-\nance. Here, a series of lateral gauge shots on readily avail-\nable materials employing a variety of different forms of cen-\ntral gauge region were undertaken in an attempt to address\nthis issue. These approaches were: \u00021\u0003 standard epoxy-resin\nencapsulation; \u00022\u0003 a dry-joint, with the gauge physically\nclamped between the two target material halves, and; \u00023\u0003\ndirect suspension of a lateral gauge in a castable biological\nadipose material. The dry-joint case was designed to create\nan air gap ahead of the gauge element which would rapidly\ndamp-out the incident shock in the encapsulation region. It\nwas reasoned that this would provide a significant target\/\ngauge encapsulation impedance missmatch. Further, preven-\ntion of shock propagation in the interlayer implied that a\ndry-mounted lateral gauge should only detect changes in lat-\neral stress resulting from the inertial confinement of the tar-\nget, with no contribution from the absent interlayer. The use\nof a castable material in the third case was designed to re-\nmove the interlayer entirely. A similar approach was adopted\nin recent work with the polymeric material Sylguard by Mil-\nlett et al.14 An observed decrease in lateral stress behind\nincident shocks in Sylguard was attributed to a strengthening\nphenomenon \u0002steric interference\u0003. In this work material was\ncast directly around the gauge, itself encased between sup-\nporting sheets of 50 \u0003m thick Mylar with, in two of three\ntests undertaken, no encapsulation ahead of the gauge ele-\nment. Given this approach it was reasoned that any response\nwould be primarily attributable to the material instead of\nbeing a function of the nature of gauge encapsulation.\nThe materials chosen for the first two tests were the\nsimple \u0002structure\u0003 thermoplastic Polystyrene15,16 and more\ncomplex thermosetting resin RTM 6.3,13 Primarily due to\ntheir low densities and ability to be cast into near net-shape\nfinal structures, polymers represent an important class of ma-\nterials. They have been widely adopted in applications as\ndiverse as aerospace composites and the matrix materials\nused to bind energetic crystals together in explosive compo-\nsitions. In such applications components can potentially be\nexposed to shock loading; i.e., loading at a sufficiently high\nstrain-rate\/pressure to overcome material shear strength \u0002re-\nsistance to shear\u0003 allowing hydrodynamic \u0002fluid-like\u0003 flow to\noccur. Consequently, knowledge of polymeric material be-\nhavior in such high strain-rate regimes is desirable. Further,\ngiven previous experimental evidence of changes in lateral\nstress behind the shock, these two materials seemed an ap-\npropriate initial point for further investigation of the behav-\nior of lateral gauges. For the third test a commercially avail-\nable fat \u0002manufactured by Matthews Foods plc and retailed\nby the Co-operative\u00ae Food Group under the brand name\n\u201cFresh Fields Lard\u201d\u0003 was employed. In addition to its ready\navailability, this material was chosen for two key reasons: \u0002i\u0003\nas it was castable at a relatively low temperature \u000250\u201360 \u00b0C;\nwith melting occurring at 35\u201340 \u00b0C\u0003, and \u0002ii\u0003 due to the\ncomplex long-chain structural nature of the glycerol units\/\nattached fatty acids17 \u0002which were expected to lead to behav-\nior analogous to a complex polymer like RTM 6 under\nshock-loading\u0003.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nLateral stress behavior was investigated via a series of\nplate-impact experiments2,3 conducted on a 50 mm bore, 5 m\nbarrel, single-stage gas-gun.18 The temporal evolution of lat-\neral stress both at, and following, shock arrival was moni-\ntored using embedded Manganin lateral stress gauges of type\nJ2M-SS-580SF-025, manufactured by Vishay Micro-\nMeasurements, USA. Two different approaches were em-\nployed for target preparation dependant on whether glued\/\ndry-jointed targets or a cast target were employed. However,\nall tests were based on a standard experimental procedure\nwith regards to the use of lateral gauges previously discussed\nin the literature.2,3 A generic lateral gauge target arrangement\nis shown in Fig. 1. Lateral gauges were introduced 2\u20134 mm\nfrom the impact face for the polystyrene and RTM 6 targets\nand at 4\u20136 mm for the cast adipose material. Gauge calibra-\ntion was based on the assumption that the thin-foil lateral\nembedded gauges reached a state of strain-equilibrium with\nthe surrounding target material.19 In addition, the calibration\ntechnique employed incorporated both the elastic-plastic be-\nhavior of manganin20 and its pressure-dependent behavior at\nstresses below its elastic limit.21 Finally, key material data\nrequired for lateral gauge calibration \u0002densities and\nlongitudinal\/shear wave sound speeds\u0003 were taken from the\nliterature for polystyrene15,16,22 and measured using a Micro-\nmetrics AccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer \u0002density\u0003 and a Pana-\nmetrics 5077PR pulse receiver in the pulse-echo configura-\ntion \u0002sound speeds\u0003 for RTM 6.3,13 In the case of the adipose\nmaterial employed to directly encapsulate gauges a density\n033524-2 Appleby-Thomas et al.

However, as only the general form of the resultant\ntraces was of interest the decision was taken to present lateral\ngauge traces as raw voltages, rather than calibrated stress\ndata. Consequently no attempts are made to draw more than\nqualitative conclusions from these results.\nWhere glued-joints were required the gauge was encap-\nsulated between two target halves whose faces were finished\nto a roughness of \u00025 \u0003m \u0002Fig. 1\u0003. Care was taken to ensure\nthat the gauge element was positioned both at a measured\nposition from \u00022\u20134 mm\u0003, and parallel to, the target impact\nface. At this point the insulated legs of the gauge were tem-\nporarily tagged to the rear-surface of one target half using\nsuperglue. A slow cure epoxy \u0002Loctite 0151 HYSOL\u00ae\nEpoxi-Patch\u00ae\u0003 allowed to set for \u000724 h was subsequently\nemployed to adhere target halves using a clamping arrange-\nment which ensured a flat\/parallel bond. For the \u201cdry\u201d joints\nthe two target halves were clamped using an identical ar-\nrangemen but were instead secured together without an ep-\noxy interlayer via the \u0002visible\u0003 rear-surface. In the case of\ncast targets the encapsulating arrangement shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 2 was employed. This arrangement comprised a\n1 mm thick Cu plate adhered to a 10 mm thick ring along its\nedge with two holes \u0002one to allow lard to be cast in situ; the\nsecond to provide a path for degassed air to escape during\ncasting\u0003. The stiffness of the lateral gauge was enhanced by\nencapsulation in 50 mm thick Mylar. Two different configu-\nrations were considered. In the first, as shown in Fig. 2, care\nwas taken to ensure that the Mylar did not protrude further\nthan the front edge of as-manufactured lateral gauge. This\nmeant that only cast material lay between the front of the\ngauge and the cover plate. With the second geometry the\nencapsulating Mylar was allowed to run ahead of the gauge\nsuch that it eventually lay flush with the Cu cover plate. In\nboth cases the resultant arrangement was clamped between,\nand protruded through \u0002to a desired\/measured distance\u0003, two\nmachined sections of polymethylmethacrylate \u0002PMMA\u0003 sub-\nsequently employed as the rear surface of the capsule. By\nensuring that the gauge was perpendicular to the machined\nPMMA surface and that the gauge element was parallel to\nthe impact face good alignment was maintained.\nAssembled targets were attached to a target ring, itself\nretained within a sacrificial barrel extension incorporating a\nseries of conducting pins. These pins, when shorted by an\nincident projectile, provided a measure of the impact veloc-\nity. Just before impact, a pair of conducting pins was used to\ntrigger a 1 GHz oscilloscope employed to record stress in-\nformation. This arrangement with a generic target is shown\nschematically in Fig. 3.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA.

Copper \u0002a well\ncharacterized material22\u0003 was chosen for the flyer material.\nFlyer thicknesses were kept at 5 mm for all of the polysty-\nrene shots and three of the five RTM 6 shots, with the re-\nmainder using 10 mm thick flyers. Pressures in the gas-gun\nbreech were approximately constant for all shots. Conse-\nquently, while with 5 mm Cu flyers impact velocities of\nc.430 m\/s were achieved, with the heavier 10 mm thick fly-\ners lower impact velocities of c.410 m\/s were recorded. Ex-\nperimental configurations employed along with measured\ngradients in the subsequently recorded gauge traces \u0002Figs. 4\nand 5 for polystyrene and RTM 6, respectively\u0003 are presented\nin Table I.\nResultant lateral gauge traces based on the experiments\ndetailed in Table I are presented in Figs. 4 and 5 for polysty-\nrene and RTM 6, respectively. With both materials, a rapid\nrise on shock arrival is followed by a slowly decreasing\nstress plateau behind a peak. This is ended by a drastic re-\nduction in stress due to the arrival of release waves from the\nrear of the flyer. A small plateau following initial shock ar-\nrival, not present with gauges at 4 mm, was apparent where\ngauges were positioned 2 mm from the impact face. How-\never, the key features in traces with a 2 mm gauge \u0002i.e.,\nmagnitude and stress gradient behind the shock\u0003 rapidly met\nequivalent traces with the gauge mounted at 4 mm. Conse-\nquently, this initial disturbance had no long term effect on\ngauge response. Following this initial plateau \u0002where\npresent\u0003, gradients were measured behind the shock for both\nmaterials. The magnitude of these stress gradients was found\nto be different for polystyrene and RTM 6. However, when\neach material was considered in isolation, the nature of lat-\neral gauge encapsulation employed was found to have no\ndiscernable effect on the measured gradient.\nAs discussed, two competing theories have been put for-\nward to explain the observed behavior behind the shock.\nThese are: \u0002i\u0003 strengthening\/an increase in \u0005 following Eq.\n\u00021\u0003 and \u0002ii\u0003 shock front dispersion due to a slower shock\nvelocity in the central encapsulating layer than in the target\nmaterial. This latter effect would lead to formation of a Mach\nstem behind the gauge resulting in an overshoot in lateral\nstress and a subsequent decay in stress behind the shock.10,11\nYellow markers setting out the extent of gradients behind the\nshock front are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, with gradients mea-\nsured between these points detailed in Table I. These markers\nwere deliberately positioned away from any initial post-rise\ngauge effects. All the polystyrene gradients exhibited similar\nmagnitudes of c.0.06 GPa \/\u0003s. As discussed, the air gap be-\ntween the target impact face and the embedded gauge in\ndry-joint tests was expected to rapidly damp-out the shock in\nthe gauge encapsulation region. Therefore, if the observed\nFIG. 3. \u0002Color online\u0003 Schematic illustration of a typical plate-impact target\nexperimental setup.\nFIG. 4. \u0002Color online\u0003 Polystyrene lateral gauge traces \u00025 mm thick Cu\nflyer\u0003.\nFIG. 5. \u0002Color online\u0003 RTM 6 lateral gauge traces.\nTABLE I.

Con-\nsequently, the observed similar gradients behind the shock\nfor polystyrene, independent of encapsulation technique,\nshown in Table I seem to imply that lateral gauge behavior is\nlinked to a material rather than geometrical\/target-assembly\nbased response.\nSimilar trends to those observed in the polystyrene lat-\neral response are apparent with the RTM 6 data, although\nwith two notable differences. First, despite very similar im-\npact conditions, the magnitude of the gradient, where a 5 mm\nflyer was employed, was c.17% less than in polystyrene. This\nchange in magnitude appears to counter the suggestion made\nby Winter and Harris10 that, because Rosenberg and Partom19\nbased their initial gauge calibration on systems where the\ngauge encapsulation and target impedances closely matched,\nthe interpretation of gauge response will primarily pick up\neffects due to the encapsulation. Instead, simply moving be-\ntween two materials with relatively similar densities\n\u00021.03\u00060.02 and 1.141\u00060.001 g \/cm3 for polystyrene and\nRTM 6, respectively\u0003 and shock Hugoniots leads to a consis-\ntent and measurable difference in gradient. Winter and\nHarris10 and Winter et al.11 suggest such a steeper gradient\nmight be attributed to a faster shock speed in polystyrene\nthan RTM 6. However, very similar shock velocity-particle\nvelocity \u0002US\u2013uP\u0003 Hugoniot relationships of US=2.65\n+1.55uP and 2.21+1.84uP have been measured for RTM 613\nand polystyrene15 respectively. Consequently, not only are\nshock speeds under near-identical loading conditions very\nsimilar but for uP\u00021.5 mm \/\u0003s, shock velocities will be\nnominally greater in RTM 6 than polystyrene. Further, the\nsuggestion that a lagging shock leading to a Mach stem in\nthe encapsulation region governs the formation of a negative\ngradient10,11 does not appear reasonable in this case as RTM\n6 is an epoxy resin system. Consequently, because there is\nknown to be a high degree of similarity in US\u2013uP Hugoniot\nrelationships for different epoxies,13 shock velocities will be\ncomparable in both RTM 6 and an epoxy-filled interlayer for\ngiven impact conditions. This means that Mach stem forma-\ntion due to shock dispersion is unlikely to occur in the\nepoxy-centered RTM 6 \u0002glued-joint\u0003 targets considered here.\nThis result appears to be further evidence that lateral\ngauges are detecting a true material rather than gauge-based\nresponse. Other results that confirm this interpretation are: \u0002i\u0003\nthe presence of observed negative gradients in RTM 6 behind\nthe shock despite the similar shock impedance of the mate-\nrial and the gauge-encapsulating epoxy; \u0002ii\u0003 the lack of a link\nbetween the observed gradients and the nature of encapsula-\ntion, and; \u0002iii\u0003 the difference in the magnitude of the ob-\nserved gradients compared to those seen with polystyrene.\nA second difference between the polystyrene and RTM 6\ndata from Table I is the reduction in the magnitude of the\nmeasured gradient from c.0.02 to c.0.04 GPa \/\u0003s when a 10\nrather than 5 mm thick flyer was employed. This is caused by\nthe observed flattening of the stress behind the shock in Fig.\n5. The models employed by Winter et al.11 do suggest estab-\nlishment of such a far-field constant stress. However, the\nnear-identical gradients apparent in the glued and dry-joint\n10 mm flyer RTM 6 shots considered here make it reasonable\nto suggest that this flattening of the curve behind the shock\nrepresents the end of the original strengthening mechanism\ngoverning the gradient. The recent work by Appleby-Thomas\net al.3 involving longitudinal gauges mounted either side of\nan RTM 6 target containing an encapsulated lateral gauge\nsuggested a similar conclusion; e.g., no significant evidence\nof shock dispersion was found despite the presence of a\nnegative gradient behind the shock in the lateral gauge trace.\nCombined with the lack of a change in gradient observed in\nFigs. 4 and 5 when the interlayer is substantially modified\n\u0002e.g., the encapsulation is replaced with a dry-joint\/air gap\u0003,\nsuch results give further credence to the suggestion that, at\nleast in the polymeric materials considered here, the nature\nof the interlayer has no significant effect on any changes in\nlateral stress observed behind the shock. This strongly sug-\ngests that such changes represent a true material response to\nthe applied shock\u2014favoring the interpretation that the gradi-\nent represents a change in material strength.\nTentative evidence was apparent of a link between the\nform of the gauge response \u0002e.g., the nature of the overshoot\nfollowing shock arrival and the final stress obtained\u0003 and the\nnature of the encapsulating layer. A lower overall stress be-\nhind the shock, combined with a gentler initial ramp-up, is\nobserved in both Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 where an encapsulating\ninterlayer was employed. The decrease in stress where a\nglued rather than dry-interlayer was employed in otherwise\nidentical experiments was typically 10%\u201313% \u0002except in the\n4 mm gauge position 5 mm Cu flyer RTM 6 case, where a\nlower difference of 2.1% was initially attributed to slightly\ndifferent impact velocities\u0003. At first glance, this relatively\nconsistent increase across two different materials appeared to\nsuggest a mechanical or geometrical\u2014rather than material\u2014\nresponse. However, when the data presented in Figs. 4 and 5\nwas converted from measured voltages accorded to estab-\nlished procedures2,3,19\u201321 it was also recentered to start at\nzero volts. The vertical offset introduced into the original\ndata was at most 0.01 V. However, in the polymeric materials\nconsidered here this small error was a significant fraction of\nrecorded voltages for the impact conditions set out in Table I.\nThe error of \u00060.01 V compared to typically measured volt-\nages of just 0.11\u20130.12 V for both polystyrene and RTM 6;\ne.g., equivalent to up to 9% of the measured voltage. This\nwas a similar ratio to the observed difference in stress dis-\ncussed above; in-line with this result, when the effects of\nthese initial offsets are included the stress magnitudes in the\npolystyrene \u0002but interestingly not the RTM 6\u0003 traces are\nfound to be essentially coincident. Consequently, more work\nwill be required before the differences in stress magnitude\ncan be categorically confirmed as a true gauge \u0002rather than\ndata reduction\u0003 response. Nevertheless, the overall form of\nthe recorded lateral gauge traces, and in particular the ob-\nserved changes in initial overshoot behavior, are unaffected\nby initial recentring of the recorded gauge data.\nThe larger overshoots in stress following shock arrival\nobserved in the dry-joint cases for both polystyrene and\nRTM 6 appear to be consistent with the stress perturbations\npredicted for the slower encapsulation shock velocity case by\n033524-5 Appleby-Thomas et al.

How-\never, this explanation is inconsistent with the RTM 6 results\nwhere a glued-joint was employed. In these cases, despite\nsimilar RTM 6\/epoxy encapsulation shock velocities,3,13 a\ngentle ramp-up to a peak stress occurs. The divergent-shock\nexplanation implies that this is caused by a shock running\nahead in the encapsulation and a consequent increase in lat-\neral stress following shock arrival. Given the observed nega-\ntive gradient behind the shock and the similar shock imped-\nances of the target and encapsulation another explanation\nwas considered. It is postulated that the larger gauge-\nelement-to-target-material surface contact area when an en-\ncapsulating interlayer is present acts to redistribute the forces\nacting on the gauge. This would then lead to a slower\nramp-up to a \u0002possibly\u0003 lower peak stress. This cushioning\nconcept is illustrated schematically in Fig. 6; arbitrary dry\nand glued-joint lateral gauge arrangements \u0002neglecting the\nbacking material\u0003 are shown in parts \u0002a\u0003 and \u0002b\u0003, respectively.\nThe different gauge\/shock front interaction scenarios illus-\ntrated are labeled \u00021\u0003 to \u00024\u0003.

Shock ar-\nrival occurs at point \u00023\u0003; with zero stress at points \u00021\u0003 and \u00022\u0003\nbeforehand. In the dry-joint case an overshoot occurs as the\ngauge rings up before equilibrium is subsequently\nestablished\u2014e.g., by point \u00024\u0003. When an interlayer is present,\nhowever, the overshoot is less severe or even nonexistent\n\u0002e.g., Fig. 5\u0003; with both phenomena illustrated in Fig. 6\u0002b\u0003.\nEffectively, a more gradual gauge loading as the shock front\narrives results compared to a virtually instantaneous response\nin the dry-joint case. In both cases, continued shock propa-\ngation, assuming a square input-pulse, will result in a con-\nstant rate of compression. Neglecting strengthening effects, a\nconstant stress behind the shock will result \u00024\u0003. It is worth\nnoting that in addition to their link to the nature of gauge\nencapsulation the initial behavior where an encapsulating\nlayer is employed does appear to have a material-specific\ncomponent. In particular, the small overshoot in stress in the\ncase of polystyrene \u0002Fig. 4\u0003 contrasts with the gentler\nramp-up with RTM 6 \u0002Fig. 5\u0003, despite both materials exhib-\niting similar behavior behind the shock. This behavior ap-\npears to be indicative of a material-dependant ring-up on\nshock arrival. Despite this material-specific component,\noverall these results appear to suggest a link between initial\ngauge response and the nature of the gauge environment.\nConsequently, in an attempt to provide further evidence of\nthe true nature of these overshoots in stress and to eliminate\nany remaining questions arising due to the continued pres-\nence of an interlayer region \u0002albeit it without any encapsu-\nlating material apart from air\u0003 in the dry-joint tests, a further\nset of experiments involving gauges cast in situ in a target\nmaterial were carried out.\nB. Cast targets\nAs discussed above the overshot in stress observed on\nshock arrival in the dry-joint case for both polystyrene and\nRTM 6 \u0002Figs. 4 and 5, respectively\u0003 had two possible expla-\nnations. These were \u00021\u0003 evidence of a Mach stem formed due\nto the lack of a propagating shock in the empty interlayer10,11\nor \u00022\u0003 a function of the nature of encapsulation, with the lack\nof an interlayer in the dry-jointed targets leading to sudden\ncompression on shock arrival at the gauge and, consequently,\nan overshoot in stress \u0002e.g., Fig. 6\u0003. In an attempt to distin-\nguish between these phenomena a series of experiments were\nconducted involving manganin lateral gauges suspended\nwithin a castable target material. This approach, as illustrated\nschematically in Fig. 2, allowed gauges to be suspended be-\ntween 4 and 6 mm from the impact face. Two arrangements\nwere considered. In the first, as shown in Fig. 2, care was\ntaken to ensure that there was \t1 mm of encapsulating My-\nlar \u0002designed to enhance gauge stiffness\/ensure alignment\u0003\nahead of the gauge element. While some Mylar was present\nahead of the gauge element the position of this material\nnever moved beyond the end of the gauges employed. In\nother words, the material ahead of the gauge comprised the\nas-cast material. It therefore seemed reasonable to suggest\nthat any observed overshoot\/changes in lateral stress behind\nthe shock in this test would be attributable to a material\nresponse rather than shock dispersion in the virtually non-\nexistent encapsulating layer. With the second arrangement\nMylar was allowed to pass beyond the end of the encapsu-\nlated gauge all the way up to the Cu cover plate shown in\nFig. 2, providing a direct comparison to the glue\/dry-jointed\nconfigurations considered previously. As mentioned earlier in\nthis paper, a commercially available fat \u0002manufactured by\nMatthews Foods plc and retailed by the Co-operative\u00ae Food\nGroup\u0003 was employed as the castable target material. This\nmaterial, due to the complex long-chain structural nature of\nthe constituent glycerol units\/attached fatty acids17 \u0002analo-\ngous to a long-chain polymeric material\u0003, was expected to\nexhibit similar behavior to the polymers studied elsewhere in\nthis paper. As these experiments were only designed to pro-\nvide a comparison to the response of polystyrene\/RTM 6,\npresentation of results from a small number of tests was\njudged sufficient to identify any qualitative behavior behind\nthe shock in this castable material. Consequently, results\nfrom three tests are included here, with experimental condi-\ntions outlined in Table II.\nLateral gauge traces showing the variation in measured\nvoltage with time for the three tests detailed in Table II are\npresented in Fig. 7. As discussed, this data is uncalibrated\ndue to the previously highlighted issues in measurement of\nshear wave velocities in the adipose material under consid-\neration. However, the general features of the traces\u2014e.g.\ngradients and relative magnitudes \u0002allowing for small errors\ndue to the elastic-plastic response of manganin\u0003\u2014would be\nmirrored if calibrated to show lateral stresses directly. As\nshown in Fig. 7, in all cases the voltage on shock arrival had\nnot quite reached the calibrated zero-value. This simply\nmeans, however, that while data following shock arrival will\nbe essentially proportional to the actual lateral stress, this\nwill not be the case for any preceding data.\nThere are a number of key features to note in the three\ntraces presented in Fig. 7. At point \u0002a\u0003 a ramp-up and subse-\nquent overshoot in stress following shock arrival is apparent\nTABLE II.

Significantly the gradient of the initial ramp\nand the magnitude of the subsequent overshoot increases\nwith impact velocity\/pressure. The slower ring-up time in the\n194 m\/s case may be partially attributable to the presence of\nMylar ahead of the gauge. However, as the ring-up time will\ndepend on shock velocity in the gauge package\u2014itself a\nfunction of pressure\u2014as observed elsewhere,2,3,16,23 it fol-\nlows that a higher velocity shot will lead to a faster ring-up\nto maximum stress. The continued presence of an overshoot\neven where no encapsulation is present ahead of the in situ\ngauge, meaning that minimal\/no shock dispersion will result,\nmight appear to favor the geometric argument put forward in\nFig. 6. Essentially, this would imply that the overshoot arises\ndue to the temporal nature of shock arrival at the gauge. For\nexample, this would suggest that for the 194 m\/s shot in Fig.\n7 the shock arrives relatively slowly leading to a minimal\novershoot, whereas for the 405 m\/s shot the faster associated\nwave speed leads to a faster shock arrival and a more-\npronounced gauge response \u0002analogous to the dry-joint case\nin Fig. 6\u0003. However, following this argument cushioning is\nlikely to have occurred minimising the magnitude of the\novershoot as shown for polystyrene in Fig. 4 and in line with\nthis concept if it were possible to include a dry-joint into the\nlard overshoots of greater magnitude might therefore be ex-\npected. However the inclusion of such an air-gap ahead of\nthe gauge is not immediately practical in such an as-cast\nmaterial. Therefore, it appears that there is insufficient infor-\nmation present within the three traces shown in Fig. 7 to\nquantatively judge the effect of the presence, or lack thereof,\nof Mylar ahead of the gauge on this overshoot. Following the\ninitial overshoot negative gradients in recorded voltage are\napparent\u2014point \u0002b\u0003\u2014in all three traces. Measured gradients\nbetween the yellow circles indicated in Fig. 7 \u0002recorded in\nTable II\u0003 were \u22120.00418 V \/\u0003s, \u22120.00345 V \/\u0003s and\n\u22120.00151 V \/\u0003s for the 682 m\/s, 405 m\/s and 194 m\/s shots\nrespectively. While uncalibrated, stress is proportional to\nmeasured voltage \u0002albeit with a required allowance for the\nelastic-plastic response of manganin\u0003. Therefore, this in-\ncrease in the magnitude of the negative gradient with impact\nstress is, in line with Eq. \u00021\u0003, strongly suggestive of a\nstrengthening phenomena. Similar phenomena were ob-\nserved previously in this paper for polystyrene and RTM 6 as\nwell as elsewhere for other materials2,7,14\u201316 \u0002although, it\nshould be noted that, while widely accepted and extensive,\nthis work is largely attributable to a limited number of au-\nthors\u0003. Such a response might be expected given the similar-\nity between the structure \u0002e.g., long polymeric-type chains\u0003\nof the glycerol units\/attached fatty acids which form the adi-\npose material \u0002lard\u000317 in question and the polymeric materials\nconsidered previously. Consequently, as with other poly-\nmeric materials, the negative gradient observed in Fig. 7\n\u0002e.g., strengthening behind the shock\u0003 is likely attributable to\na steric interference effect.14 Finally, at point \u0002c\u0003 on all three\ntraces presented in Fig. 7, release waves from the rear of the\nflyer lead to the end of 1D conditions at the manganin gauge,\nending the shock. In addition on the 682 and 405 m\/s traces\nat point \u0002d\u0003 a reloading event occurs due to arrival of a re-\nflected shock from the rear-surface of the lard target. This\noccurs because the gauge is located 6 mm from the Cu front\ncover in these two experiments\u2014e.g., just 4 mm from the\nrear PMMA \u0002which has a higher density at 1.186 g \/cm3 than\nthe lard22\u0003. Conversely, with the 194 m\/s shot the gauge is\npositioned a further 2 mm from the PMMA, providing suffi-\ncient time for releases from the rear of the flyer to catch up\nbefore a reflected shock from the PMMA can arrive.\nOverall there appears to be a good correlation between\nthe three traces presented in Fig. 7, independent of whether\nMylar is present ahead of the gauge or not, with differences\ndirectly attributable to the differing impact conditions. A key\npoint appears to be the presence of both an initial overshoot\nand gradient behind the shock \u0002in this case in recorded volt-\nage\u0003 in the 682 and 405 m\/s cases. Both the overshoot and\ngradient are of a greater magnitude than the corresponding\nfeatures in the 194 m\/s case, despite the lack of Mylar ahead\nof the gauge which would negate shock dispersion and the\nassociated stress perturbations\/potential Mach stem forma-\ntion. Given that gauges are cast in situ this result seems to\nsuggest that lateral gauge response is consistent independent\nof the presence or otherwise of an encapsulating Mylar layer;\ne.g., that the embedded gauge is, at least to some extent,\ndetecting a true material response. This conclusion backs the\nevidence of a lack of an interlayer effect on gradient behind\nthe shock inferred from the similarity of glued and dry-\njointed lateral gauge traces in a particular material presented\nearlier. Further, it is also supported in the literature; e.g., the\npresence of similar gradients on in situ cast gauges observed\nby Millett et al. in the elastomeric material Sylgard.14\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nPlate-impact experiments have been employed on\npolymeric-like materials in three different arrangements to\ninvestigate the nature of lateral manganin stress gauge re-\nsponse. In the first set of tests the response of lateral gauges\nin simple and complex polymeric materials \u0002polystyrene and\nRTM 6, respectively\u0003 was studied employing both an encap-\nsulating Mylar\/epoxy interlayer and a dry-joint with no in-\nterlayer present. The nature of the encapsulating layer has\nbeen shown to influence initial response and the ramp-up to\nFIG. 7. \u0002Color online\u0003 Lateral gauge traces showing the variation in re-\ncorded voltage with time for 10 mm thick Cu projectiles impacting the\narrangement shown schematically in Fig. 2 at three different impact\nvelocities.\n033524-8 Appleby-Thomas et al.

Significant over-\nshoots in stress following shock arrival were recorded where\na dry-joint was employed, not present in the encapsulated-\ngauge case. This was attributed to a cushioning effect, where\nthe presence of an interlayer led to redistribution of force\naway from the embedded gauge element. Given that a dry-\njoint arrangement arguably detects a material response-only,\nthis result does suggest that, at least during the early part of\nthe shock, allowance for the presence of an interlayer in\ntypical embedded lateral gauge target geometries may be re-\nquired. However, further work is clearly required before any\nfirm conclusions can be reached. Finally, in otherwise essen-\ntially identical experiments, constant gradients behind the\nshock independent of the nature of gauge encapsulation, but\ndependant on the target material have been observed. Taken\ntogether these modified-interlayer results appear suggestive\nof detection of a material-based response by embedded lat-\neral gauges behind the shock.\nSimilar conclusions were reached where a lateral gauge\nwas directly embedded in an adipose material \u0002Matthews\nFoods plc\/Co-operative\u00ae Food Group \u201cFresh Fields Lard\u201d\u0003.\nInsufficient information was available to definitively identify\nthe cause of observed overshoots following shock arrival,\nalthough there was tentative evidence that the geometric ef-\nfect postulated to explain similar behavior observed in the\ndry-glued-joint polystyrene lateral responses was involved.\nSignificantly, even when the gauge was almost entirely iso-\nlated within the as-cast material \u0002e.g., \t1 mm of Mylar pro-\ntruded ahead of the gauge element\u0003 a substantial gradient\nwas apparent behind the shock. Given that the lack of an\ninterlayer would prevent shock dispersion this appeared to be\nindicative of a hardening phenomena.\nOverall, these results\u2014particularly the consistent nature\nof gradients behind the shock for a given material when the\nencapsulating interlayer was substantially modified\u2014appear\nto suggest that, at least in polymeric systems, changes in\nlateral gauge trace gradient behind the shock are related to a\nmaterial response rather than a geometric target-construction\neffect.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe Institute of Shock Physics \u0002Imperial College Lon-\ndon\u0003 is gratefully acknowledged for their sponsorship of this\nresearch program.
