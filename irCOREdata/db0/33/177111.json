Currently, invasive \ncoronary angiography (CA) is regarded as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for the assessment of coronary \nanatomy.  However, conventional CA has limitations.  It is an invasive procedure with a small \n(0.1 to 0.2%) risk of major complications[3] and affords information only on the site and \ndegree of luminal narrowing \u2013 providing no data on the extent of atherosclerotic change \nwithin the vessel wall.  Images are obtained in only two dimensions \u2013 though the use of \nmultiple projections enables a more comprehensive assessment of any individual lesion.  \nFinally, there are constraints on the amount of CA that can be undertaken, both in terms of \ninfrastructure and cardiologist time.  An accurate non-invasive test for diagnosing CAD that \ncould potentially avoid the need for some CA is, therefore, highly desirable. \nMultislice computed tomography (MSCT) has been developing rapidly in recent \nyears.  Four-slice machines appeared in 1998, 16-slice in 2001 and 64-slice in 2004.  This has \nresulted in greatly increased temporal and spatial resolution[4] \u2013 facilitating the rapid \nidentification and assessment of atherosclerosis within the moving coronary arteries[5,6] and \ngenerating considerable interest in the concept that MSCT might potentially reduce the need \nfor invasive CA. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the accuracy of 64-slice CT \nangiography compared with conventional CA in the diagnosis and assessment of CAD.   \n \nMETHODS \n \nSearch strategy  \nHighly sensitive search strategies were developed using both appropriate subject headings and \ntext word terms.  Full details of the search strategies used are available from the authors.  We \nsearched the following electronic databases: Medline (2002 \u2013 November Week 3 2006), \nEmbase (2002 to December 2006), Biosis (2002 to December 2006), Science Citation Index \n(2002 \u2013 December 2006), Medline In-Process (14th December 2005), Cochrane Controlled \nTrials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2006), Cochrane Database of Systematic \nReviews (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of \nEffectiveness (December 2006), HTA Database (December 2006) and Health Management \nInformation Consortium (2002 \u2013 May 2006). In addition, recent conference proceedings and \nreference lists of all included studies were scanned to identify additional potentially relevant \nstudies.  Searches were from 2002 onwards and restricted to English language reports.  \n \nInclusion criteria \nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised comparative studies or \ncase series involving adults with suspected or known CAD.  The index test was 64-slice CT \nangiography compared with conventional CA as the reference standard.  Studies had to report \nsensitivity and specificity or true and false positives and negatives. \n \nData extraction \nOne reviewer screened the titles (and abstracts if available) of all reports identified by the \nsearch strategy.  Full copies of potentially relevant reports were obtained and two reviewers \nindependently assessed them for inclusion.  Data were extracted independently by two \nreviewers.  Disagreements were resolved by consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer.   \n \nQuality assessment \nTwo reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of full text studies using \nQUADAS[7] which was modified to make it more applicable to studies for diagnosing and \nassessing CAD.  Three questions in the original QUADAS tool that related to the quality of \nreporting rather than methodological quality were excluded (questions 2, 8 and 9).  Three \nquestions were added on (a) whether an established cutoff point was used (question 12), (b) \n 3\nwhether data on observer variation were reported and within an acceptable range (question \n13) and (c) whether data were presented for appropriate subgroups of patients (question 14).  \nDisagreements were resolved by consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer.     \n \nStatistical analysis \nWhere three or more studies reported data, summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) \ncurves were derived for the following levels of analysis: patient, segment, artery (left main, \nproximal left anterior descending (LAD), any LAD, left circumflex (LCX), right coronary \nartery (RCA)), stent and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).  The meta-analysis method \nused was the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model,[8] \nfitted using WinBUGS 1.4.[9]  A symmetric SROC model was used to address the lack of \nnumerical convergence of the full SROC model.  Pooled estimates for sensitivity and \nspecificity were reported as medians and 95% credible intervals (CrIs), the Bayesian \nequivalent of confidence intervals (CIs).      \nIf numerical difficulties were encountered with the symmetric HSROC model and \nthere was also no evidence of heterogeneity, sensitivity and specificity were pooled using the \nweighted average method.[10]  These analyses were carried out using Metadisc software[11] \nand corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (rather than CrIs) were reported.  This \napproach was required for the left main artery analysis.  Heterogeneity was assessed using the \nI2 statistic in Metadisc software,[11] with a value greater than 50% considered to represent \nsubstantial heterogeneity.[12] \n \nRESULTS \n \nFigure 1 shows the flow of studies through the review.  Out of a total of 1211 titles\/abstracts \nscreened, 275 were selected as potentially relevant and full papers obtained where possible.  \nForty studies (21 full text, [13-33] 19 abstracts [34-52]), published in 67 reports, met the \ninclusion criteria.  All were non-randomised studies comparing 64-slice CT with a reference \nstandard of invasive CA.   \n \n[Figure 1 Flow of studies through review process] \n \nThe characteristics of the included studies are available as online content, linked to \nthe online manuscript.  The 40 studies involved more than 2400 people.  In 25 studies \nreporting gender 67% (n=1184) of participants were men.  Across 27 studies reporting mean \nage this ranged from 54 to 69 years (median 61 years).  Most studies reported elective \nassessment for CAD, with study populations including those with suspected CAD, known \nCAD, or both.  In addition the following specific groups were studied: patients with previous \nPCI or CABG and those with a suspected acute coronary syndrome.   \nAll studies used 64-slice CT angiography.  Most studies (n=28) used Siemens \nSensation 64 machines; other types of equipment used included GE Healthcare Light-Speed \nVCT (n=2), Philips Brilliance 64 (n=2) and Toshiba Multi-Slice Aquilion 64 (n=1).   \nThe quality assessment for the 21 full text studies is summarised in Figure 2.  In all \nstudies conventional CA was the reference standard, results were abstracted only if patients \nreceived both 64-slice CT angiography and the reference standard (partial verification bias \navoided), patients received the same reference standard (differential verification bias avoided) \nand the index test did not form part of the reference standard (incorporation bias avoided).  In \n85% of studies those interpreting 64-slice CT data were blinded to the results of the reference \nstandard test (test review bias avoided) and in 71% of studies vice versa (diagnostic review \nbias avoided).  In 48% of studies the participants belonged to specific groups (spectrum bias), \nfor example those with previous revascularisation. \n \n[Figure 2 Results of the quality assessment of the 21 full text studies] \n \n 4\n 5\nTwenty-eight studies provided sufficient data (true positives, false positives, false \nnegatives, true negatives) to allow their inclusion in the meta-analyses, although the number \nof studies included for each level of analysis varied (see Table 1).  The pooled estimates for \nthe sensitivity and specificity of 64-slice CT angiography for detecting significant CAD for \neach level of analysis are shown in Figure 3 (also available in a table as online content linked \nto the online manuscript).  Across studies the median PPV and NPV along with their ranges \nfor each level of analysis are shown in Figure 4 (also available in a table as online content \nlinked to the online manuscript).  All studies used a cut-off of > 50% or \u2265 50% stenosis to \ndefine significant CAD.  \nTable 1 Studies included in the pooled estimates for different levels of analysis \n \nLevel of analysis  \nStudy id Patient Segment Left main \nartery \nLAD artery Proximal \nLAD artery \nLCX artery RCA Stent CABG \n Full text studies \nEhara 2006a[13] \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nGhostine 2006[15] \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nHoffmann 2006[16] \uf0fc          \nLeber 2005[18]  \uf0fc       \uf0fc   \nLeschka 2005[19]  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nMeijboom 2006[20] \uf0fc  \uf0fc   \uf0fc   \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nMollet 2005[21] \uf0fc  \uf0fc         \nNikolaou 2006[22] \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc   \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nOng 2006[23]  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nPache 2006[24] \uf0fc         \uf0fc  \nPlass 2006[25] \uf0fc  \uf0fc         \nPugliese 2006a[26] \uf0fc  \uf0fc   \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc  \uf0fc    \nRaff 2005[27] \uf0fc  \uf0fc         \nRist 2006[28]        \uf0fc   \nRixe 2006[29]        \uf0fc   \nRopers 2006a[30] \uf0fc  \uf0fc         \n 6\n 7\nLevel of analysis  \nStudy id Patient Segment Left main \nartery \nLAD artery Proximal \nLAD artery \nLCX artery RCA Stent CABG \nRopers 2006b[31] \uf0fc  \uf0fc        \uf0fc  \nSchuijf 2006[32] \uf0fc  \uf0fc       \uf0fc   \n Abstracts \nBecker 2006[35] \uf0fc          \nEhara 2006b[36]        \uf0fc   \nHausleiter 2005[38]         \uf0fc  \nMalagutti 2006[41] \uf0fc         \uf0fc  \nOncel 2006[42]        \uf0fc   \nOnuma 2006[43]  \uf0fc         \nRubinshtein \n2006a[47] \n\uf0fc          \nRubinshtein \n2006b[48] \n\uf0fc          \nSavino 2006[49] \uf0fc  \uf0fc         \nSchlosser 2006[50]  \uf0fc         \n \nNotes: \n1.

Specificity was lower at 89% \n(95% CrI 83 to 94%).  The median NPV across studies was very high at 100% (range 86 to \n100%), while PPV was 93% (range 64 to 100%).  The wide range of PPVs is probably due to \nthe studies being heterogeneous in terms of their populations and the prevalence of significant \nCAD (median across studies 58%, range 23 to 96%).  The median false positive rate across \nstudies was 10% (range 0 to 50%), representing an overestimation of the presence of non-\nsignificant stenosis as significant, as opposed to finding CAD where none existed.  There was \nvery low statistical heterogeneity in terms of sensitivity (I2=0.1%) and moderate statistical \nheterogeneity in terms of specificity (I2=31.7%).  In 17 studies reporting coronary artery \nsegment-based detection (n=14,199), compared with patient-based detection, pooled \nsensitivity was lower (90%, 95% CrI 85 to 94%), specificity higher (97%, 95% CrI 95 to \n98%), median PPV lower (76%, range 44 to 93%) and NPV similar (99%, range 95 to 100%). \n Five of 18 studies in the pooled estimates for patient-based detection of CAD, and \nthree of 17 for segment-based detection, were abstracts. A sensitivity analysis undertaken to \nexamine the effect of removing abstracts from the pooled estimates found that this did not \naffect the results. For patient-based detection sensitivity (95% CrI) remained unchanged at \n99% (97 to 99%), while specificity increased slightly to 91% (84 to 95%). For segment-based \ndetection sensitivity also remained unchanged at 90% (84 to 94%), while specificity \ndecreased slightly to 96% (95% CrI 94 to 98%).     \n \nArtery level analyses \nAt artery level pooled sensitivity and specificity were both highest for the left main artery \n(95% (95% CI 84 to 99%); 100% (95% CI 99 to 100%) respectively).  Pooled sensitivity was \nlowest for the LCX at 85% (95% CrI 69 to 94%).  Pooled specificity estimates for all of the \narteries were very high at \u2265 96%.  Across studies the median PPV and NPV were also both \nhighest for the left main artery (100%, range 90 to 100%; 100% (all five studies) \nrespectively).  The median NPVs for all of the arteries were very high at \u2265 98% (ranges: LAD \n95 to 100%; LCX 93 to 100%; RCA 94 to 100%).  The median PPV was lowest for the LCX \n(81%, range 56 to 100%).   \n \nSpecific subgroups \nIn six studies reporting patency of stents (n=317), with a cutoff > or \u2265 50% in-stent restenosis \ndefining a positive test result, sensitivity was 89% (95% CrI 68 to 97%) and specificity 94% \n(95% CrI 83 to 98%), while across studies the median PPV was 77% (range 33 to 100%) and \nNPV was 96% (range 71 to 100%).  Stents caused some problems for 64-slice CT.  Leber and \ncolleagues[18] reported that, of nine stents without any restenosis on conventional CA, four \nwere false positives on 64-slice CT due to artifacts caused by the dense stent material.  \nImportantly, the utility of CT angiography appears to be greatly influenced by the diameter \nand strut-thickness of the stent.[29]  In three studies[28,29,36] 21% (59\/276) of stents were \nclassed as unevaluable and excluded from analysis, while the remaining three studies did not \nreport this information. \nFour studies reported patency of bypass grafts (n=543).  Both sensitivity and \nspecificity were very high (99%, 95% CrI 95 to 100%; 96%, 95% CrI 86 to 99% \nrespectively), while across studies the median PPV was 93% (range 90 to 95%) and NPV was \nvery high at 99% (range 98 to 100%). \nOnly three studies[16,35,46] assessed the diagnostic performance of 64-slice CT in \npatients admitted to hospital with suspected acute coronary syndromes (n=232).  Across these \nstudies the median (range) values were 100% (97 to 100%) for sensitivity, 100% (79 to \n100%) for specificity, 100% (87 to 100%) for PPV and 100% (94 to 100%) for NPV.    \n 9\n \nTechnical limitations \nScans could not be adequately evaluated in 2% (11\/718) of patients (n=13 studies), 8% \n(997\/12,476) of all arterial segments, 21% (59\/276) of stented segments (n=3 studies) and 0% \n(0\/231) of bypass grafts (n=2 studies).  Three percent (11\/404) of scans of the left main artery, \n5% (74\/1641) of the RCA and 6% of both the LAD (104\/1789) and the LCX (93\/1444) could \nnot be evaluated.  Studies reported that poor image quality was caused by factors including \nirregular heart rhythm, sinus tachycardia > 90\/min, calcification, vessel motion or small \nvessel calibre in distal segments. \nIt is unclear to what extent the exclusion or otherwise of small diameter vessels \naffected 64-slice CT performance as only seven studies provided this information, with \nfive[19,23,25,30,31] excluding segments < 1.5 mm in diameter from analysis and two[20,27] \nanalysing all vessels regardless of size.  Across the five studies excluding segments < 1.5 mm \nthe median sensitivity was 87% (range 85 \u2013 94%) and specificity 96% (range 76 \u2013 97%) \ncompared with median sensitivity of 90% (range 86 \u2013 94%) and specificity of 96.5% (range \n95 \u2013 98%) for the two studies analysing all segments. \nCoronary artery calcification may make scans more difficult to interpret.  Ghostine \nand colleagues[15] noted that heavily calcified segments accounted for 21 (81%) of 26 false \nnegative results.  In the study by Raff and colleagues[27] the false positive rate increased as \ncalcification became more severe, with a 2% (14\/709) false positive rate in segments rated as \n\u2018no calcification\u2019, 6% (5\/89) in those rated as \u2018mild\u2019, 13% (6\/48) in those rated as \u2018moderate\u2019 \nand 18% (16\/88) in those segments rated as \u2018severe\u2019.   \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe current study suggests that 64-slice CT angiography is highly sensitive for patient-based \ndetection of significant CAD (\u2265 50% stenosis), with a very high NPV.   This high NPV was \nalso apparent in analyses based on individual coronary arteries and segments.  At artery level \nthe best results for 64-slice CT were in those arteries such as left main and LAD where \nsignificant CAD carries the poorest prognosis.  Based on a few small studies, broadly similar \nresults were demonstrated in patients who had undergone prior coronary artery stenting, \nCABG and those with a suspected acute coronary syndrome. \n \nPrior studies \nWe did not identify any other published systematic reviews focusing on 64-slice CT.  Several \nsystematic reviews of MSCT[5,6,53-55] included 64-slice CT studies, all of which are \nincluded in our review.  A systematic review by Stein and colleagues[5] of multidetector (4-\nslice and higher) CT for the diagnosis of CAD identified one 64-slice CT study by Leschka \nand colleagues.[19] The authors concluded that the preliminary data with 64-slice CT \nsuggested that it was more sensitive and specific than 16-slice CT, and that multidetector CT \nhad the potential to be used as a screening test in appropriate patients.  The USA Technology \nEvaluation Center[6] (a subsidiary of the private providers Blue Cross and Blue Shield), in a \nreview of CT angiography (32-slice or higher) identified six 64-slice CT \nstudies.[18,19,21,26,27,30] The authors reported that in patient-based analysis the 64-slice CT \nstudies showed high sensitivities and specificities compared with the reference standard of \nconventional coronary angiography.[6]  A technology assessment by Patel and \ncolleagues,[54] undertaken for the USA Medicare Coverage Advisory Commission included \nCT angiography (16-slice or higher) and identified six 64-slice CT \nstudies.[18,19,21,26,27,30,37] The authors concluded that the sensitivity and specificity of \n64-slice CT in patient-based analysis looked promising.[54] Systematic reviews and meta-\nanalyses by Sun and colleagues[55] (4-slice or higher) and Hamon and colleagues[53] (16-\nslice or higher) identified seven[18,19,21,26,27,30,37] and nine[13,18,19,21,22,26,27,30,32] \n64-slice CT studies respectively. Both reviews undertook meta-analyses at patient, vessel and \nsegment level, although neither presented separate pooled estimates for the group of 64-slice \nCT studies. In patient-based analysis Sun and colleagues[55] reported pooled estimates (95% \n 10\nconfidence interval (CI)) of 91% (88 to 95%) sensitivity and 86% (81 to 92%) specificity. The \nauthors concluded that diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved with 64-slice scanners \ncompared with 4- and 16-slice scanners.[55] In patient-based analysis Hamon and \ncolleagues[53] reported pooled estimates (95% CI) of 96% (94 to 98%) sensitivity and 74% \n(65 to 84%) specificity. The authors concluded that MSCT had shortcomings difficult to \novercome in daily practice, with continuing moderate specificity in patient-based analysis in \npatients with high prevalence of CAD. They stated that studies evaluating the diagnostic \nperformance of the newest-generation MSCT, including patients with low to moderate CAD \nprevalence, would be critical in establishing the clinical role of this emerging technology as \nan alternative to CA.[53]   \n \nRadiation doses \nAlthough CT is regarded as non-invasive, it delivers a higher radiation dose than conventional \nCA and concerns have been raised about indiscriminate or repetitive use and, in particular, the \nrisks in younger individuals or women of childbearing age.[56]  Hausleiter and colleagues[57] \nreported an effective radiation dose of 11.0 (SD 4.1) mSv for 64-slice CT.  By comparison \nestimates of mean effective doses for conventional CA include < 5 mSv by a British \nCardiovascular Society Working Group,[58] and 4 to 8 mSv by the Technology Evaluation \nCenter.[59]  In this review six studies[15-18,22,28] reported 64-slice CT radiation dose for \nthe patient population as a whole and six[20,21,26,27,30,31] reported it separately for men \nand women.  The radiation dose for men ranged from 7.5 mSv[30] to 15.2 mSv[20,21] and for \nwomen from 10.2 mSv[31] to 21.4 mSv.[20,21]  Two[30,31] of these studies using ECG-\ncontrolled dose modulation to reduce the tube current during systole reported the lowest \nradiation doses: 7.5 mSv[30] and 8.6 mSv[31] for men and 10.2 mSv[30] and 12.2 mSv[31] \nfor women. One study[19] used an alternative technique, automatic exposure control,[60] to \nreduce radiation dose exposure but did not report the actual dosage values that the patients \nreceived. With the development of more modern technologies and methods, it may be \npossible to reduce the radiation dose further. Einstein and colleagues[61] have estimated that \na single 64-slice CT study would result in an increase in lung cancer and breast cancer risk, \nespecially if used in younger patients (for example a lifetime attributable cancer risk of 1 in \n114 after a combined heart and aortic scan in a 20-year old woman, compared to 1 in 715 for \na 60-year old woman, with risks reduced by ECG controlled modulation). \n \nStrengths and limitations \nThe current review included both full text studies and conference abstracts in an attempt to \nobtain the latest available data.  All studies used the same reference standard of conventional \nCA and only data for those who received both index test and reference standard were included \nin the meta-analyses.  A limitation was that non-English language studies were excluded.  No \nadjustment was made for studies which used multiple samples from each participant for some \nlevels of analysis.  \n \nImplications for practice \nGiven the high sensitivity and negative predictive value, the main role of MSCT may be to \nrule out significant CAD, and thereby reduce the need for invasive CA.  There are several \nclinical situations where this may be particularly useful. In patients with a very low \nprobability of CAD it is unlikely that MSCT would be recommended, particularly given the \nradiation doses involved. Likewise, when the probability of CAD is high conventional \nangiography is likely to remain the investigation of choice in the majority of patients. \nHowever, very many patients fall into an intermediate category where the diagnosis of CAD \nremains uncertain following clinical assessment and simple non-invasive testing. Currently, \nthis may necessitate either myocardial perfusion scanning or invasive CA. It seems likely that \nMSCT may have an increasing role in this setting.  \nThere are other specific settings where MSCT may be of particular value. For \nexample, in patients with acute chest pain a test with the capacity to rapidly and effectively \nrule out significant CAD \u2013 or provide a definitive diagnosis - has obvious potential. The \n 11\nlimited data currently available suggest that this may indeed be the case.[62] In patients with a \nhistory of CABG invasive angiography may be more technically difficult, time-consuming \nand associated with higher radiation doses. MSCT may, therefore, have some advantages in \nselected patients following surgical revascularisation. Likewise, many patients who are \nscheduled to undergo surgery for valvular heart disease and other non-coronary cardiac \nconditions currently undergo \u2018routine\u2019 invasive angiography \u2013 much of which might be \nreplaced by MSCT.[20,63]    \n \nConclusion \nAlthough further work is required to determine the prognostic utility of MSCT and to clarify \nits precise clinical role, the currently available data suggest that it will play an increasing role \nin the evaluation of patients with known or suspected CAD. The technology continues to \nevolve and data are awaited on the marginal costs and benefits of the next generation of \nMSCT, the 256 and higher-slice CT machines. \n \nCONTRIBUTORS \n \nNW designed the study.
