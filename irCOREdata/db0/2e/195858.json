The \npost 1990 era, however, has seen a universal, and unexplained, reduction in EUV quantum efficiency \n(QE). An analysis of microchannel plate glass composition has recorded variations in along channel \ncomposition for the first time. These observations may provide insight into the lost QE problem and \npresent a way forward for the development of future EUV missions. \n \nAlthough originally developed as photon detectors MCPs have more recently been applied as low mass \nX-ray optics for X-ray astronomy and planetary science, where fluorescent X-rays from planetary \nsurfaces yield information on surface composition. The Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), on \nthe BepiColombo mission to Mercury, will have two instrument channels, both of which use MCP optical \nelements. The optimisation of the high spatial resolution imaging X-ray optics of MIXS-T is described \nand the novel MCP collimator geometry for the high throughput MIXS-C channel is introduced for the \nfirst time. The performance of both channels at Mercury is predicted. \n \nAn in situ investigation into the effects of the International Space Station space environment on MCP \noptics has led to the serendipitous discovery of nanometre scale dust particles in near Earth space and the \nrealisation of filmed MCPs as extremely sensitive cosmic dust detectors. Analysis of the exposed samples \nand evaluation of the discovery are presented and possibilities for future dedicated experiments are \nexplored.  \n \nMicrochannel plates continue to be an important technology in astronomy and planetary science. This \nthesis describes developments in traditional MCP applications and the introduction of new ones, all of \nwhich will lead to unique measurement capabilities and significant scientific advancements. \n \n    \n iv\nACKNOWLEGEMENTS \n \n \nI must first thank Professor George Fraser for giving me the opportunity to undertake this PhD and for his \nhelp over the last few years, without which this could never have happened. Thanks must also to all \nmembers of the Space Research Centre who have helped and advised me over the last few years, \nparticularly to Jim Pearson who has the patience of a saint and whose steadying influence has kept me on \ntrack many a time. Special thanks must also go to Tim Stevenson for his advice and valuable experience \nand for recognising potential. \n \nThanks must also go to my fellow PhD students Steve Smith, Dean Talboys, Jimmy Nussey, Adrian \nMartindale and Dan Thompson for all the beer and banter and for sharing the experience. \n \nA special thanks to Bekki who\u2019s love, support and patience throughout has been a rock and for \nrecognising that I wanted to do this before I did. Her encouragement and belief in me has been invaluable. \n \nThanks also to Mum and Dad who have believed in me, encouraged me and been there when I needed \nthem. Thanks particularly to Dad for challenging me to do what I wanted to and helping me to see what \nthat was. \n \nFinally I gratefully acknowledge the financial support that I have received from the Engineering and \nPhysical Sciences Research Council, Photonis SAS and the Department of Physics and Astronomy. \n v\nLIST OF PUBLICATIONS \n \nSome of the results reported in this thesis and other results obtained by the author during the preparation \nof this thesis have been incorporated into the following publications.

Arrays of microscopic multipliers \ncould, it was realised, be used as position sensitive and photon counting detectors and microchannel \nplates (MCPs) were conceived. The early development of these detectors was for military use in \u201cnight \nvision\u201d applications (Schagen, 1971) and MCPs became a classified technology. \n \nSince declassification in the late 1960s (Ruggieri, 1972) microchannel plates have become invaluable as \nphoton and particle detectors for the scientific community. In X-ray astronomy, MCP detectors have been \nused extensively in instrumentation such as the High Resolution Imager on Einstein, the first dedicated X-\nray observatory (Giacconi, et al., 1979), and the High Resolution Camera on the Chandra X-ray \nobservatory launched in 1999. Other missions with MCP based instrumentation include Exosat, Rosat, \nEUVE, and HST. \n \nMore recently MCPs have become the basis for low mass, grazing incidence X-ray\/UV optics, ideal for \napplications in space based astronomy and planetary science (Martin, 1999). The Lobster-ISS X-ray \ntelescope (Fraser et al., 2002) and Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), on Europe\u2019s \nBepiColombo mission to Mercury, will be the first space instruments to use MCP optics, and both are \nintended for operation within the next decade. The development of these optics has led to the \nserendipitous realisation of MCPs as highly sensitive detectors of interplanetary dust and space debris, \nwith sensitivity to particle diameters almost two orders of magnitude smaller than previously flown \ndetectors. \n1.2 Microchannel Plate detectors \nSingle channel electron multipliers (CEMs), like that shown in Figure 1.1, are tubes made from a resistive \nmaterial whose secondary electron emission properties have been optimised to provide a large number of \nlow energy secondary electrons following interactions with a primary photoelectron. Ionisation at the \nchannel entrance excites secondary electrons, which are then accelerated parallel to the channel axis by an \nelectric field. These electrons eventually strike the channel walls where they excite further secondary \nemission. The number of electrons in the avalanche multiplies exponentially along the channel to produce \na detectable pulse at the channel\u2019s end. The channel must be evacuated sufficiently that the mean free \npath of the electrons is of the same order of magnitude as the flight paths required. Microchannel plate \ndetectors are composed of arrays of ~107 microscopic CEMs (Fraser, 1989).  \n \nThe signal gain of a CEM is dependent on the channel\u2019s aspect ratio (the ratio of channel\u2019s length L to its \ndiameter D) and not its absolute diameter (Adams and Manley, 1966) so it is possible to reduce the \nchannel dimensions, and stack channels together to form arrays with no loss of gain. Such arrays can be \ncoupled with a position sensitive readout to allow imaging. \n \nFigure 1.1. The electron avalanche along a typical channel electron multiplier. Gains of ~104 are typical \nfor a single incident event. The potential difference across the detector is typically 1.5-4 kV. \n \nThe first imaging readouts based on arrays of CEMs were produced by stacking together many individual \nchannels into arrays (Wiley and Hendee, 1962 and Somer and Graves, 1969). The requirement for \u201cnight \nvision\u201d (Schagen, 1971), in military applications, eventually led to a new process for manufacturing \narrays of microscopic CEMs, by the drawing and etching of lead glass, described in Chapter 2, and the \nproduction of the first MCPs. \n \nA typical MCP detector consists of two or three MCPs stacked one above the other in a \u201cdoublet\u201d or \n\u201ctriplet\u201d arrangement to provide an increase in gain. The channel axes of both MCPs will normally have a \nbias angle of between 6\u00b0 and 13\u00b0 relative to the normal to the front surface of the plate and microchannels \nof alternate plates will be orientated in a chevron configuration as shown in Figure 1.2. This chevron \narrangement minimises the noise contribution to images due to ion feedback, which occurs when ions, \nafter liberation from the microchannel surface, travel in a direction opposite to the electrons and initiate \nfurther avalanches in the MCP. The earliest accounts of two stage multipliers are given by Parkes and \nGott (1971) and Colson et al. (1973). \n 2\n \nFigure 1.2. A typical stacking configuration for a two stage \u201cdoublet\u201d MCP detector with the bias angles \narranged in a chevron to prevent ion feedback and reduce image noise. \n \nDespite having some advantages over solid state detectors (e.g. high photon count rates),  MCPs have \nlargely been superseded by detectors, such as charge coupled devices (CCDs), as the detectors of choice \nfor astronomy in the X-ray band from ~250 eV to a few tens of keV. This is due largely to the lack of \nintrinsic energy resolution exhibited by MCPs for which it is inappropriate to assign a representative \u2206E \nvalue, though two colour photometry is possible (Fraser, 1989). Solid state detectors have a high intrinsic \nenergy resolution, with a typical \u2206E of ~200 eV but tend to have low quantum efficiencies (QE) in the \nExtreme Ultraviolet (EUV) waveband, from ~30 eV \u2013 250 eV. In EUV astronomy therefore MCPs \nremain the detector of choice.  \n1.2.1 Applications of MCP detectors in the extreme ultra-violet waveband \nWhen used in conjunction with an energy dependent dispersion element such as a diffraction grating or \nmultilayer normal incidence grating (Bannister et. al., 1999) MCPs can be used as highly sensitive \nspectrometers due to their high spatial resolution. New developments in Vernier readouts for MCPs have \nenabled their measured spatial resolution to approach the theoretical limit at channel pitch of the MCPs \n(Lapington et al., 1998). The JPEX sounding rocket experiment (Bannister et al., 1999) used a \ncombination of high resolution progressive geometry Vernier readout, 6\u00b5m diameter pore MCPs and \nmultilayer normal incidence gratings to provide unprecedented spectral resolution in the Extreme \nUltraviolet (\u03bb\/\u2206\u03bb=4700 measured at 235 \u00c5 (52.8 eV)).  \n \nThe quantum efficiency (QE) of MCP detectors in the EUV waveband has typically been measured to be \n>8% (Kowalski et al., 1986; Hemphill et al., 1997; Jelinsky 1996; Bannister et al, 2000) but recent MCP \ndetectors have been found to have EUV QEs <5%. No notable change in QE is observed for photons with \nsoft X-ray energies >250 eV (Bannister, 2001). This loss of QE has serious consequences for EUV \nastronomy but the underlying mechanism for this loss of QE is unknown. Chapter 2 describes an \ninvestigation into the \u201calong channel\u201d composition of MCPs, using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence \nspectroscopy. The results of this investigation indicate a possible mechanism for the loss of QE and a way \nforwards in restoring their EUV performance.  \n 3\n1.3 Microchannel plate optics \nThe interaction of X-rays with matter is governed by the complex refractive index n, defined as  \n\u03b2\u03b4 in \u2212\u2212=1 ,                (1.1) \nwhere \u03b4 and \u03b2 are called the refractive index decrement and absorption index, whose origins are described \nin Chapter 5. The real part of the refractive index is typically very close to unity and so the refraction \nangles between media are very small. Conventional refractive lenses would therefore require very long \nfocal lengths in order to focus X-rays. X-rays are also heavily attenuated during transmission through a \nlens material and resultantly almost all flux is lost. For this reason refractive optics are impractical for \napplications to X-rays and so reflection is the preferred means of X-ray focussing. Normal incidence \nreflectivities however are very low for X-rays and thus grazing incidence reflection is used in most X-ray \noptical systems such as microscopes and telescopes (Underwood, 1978; Willingale, 1984).  \n \nConventionally, grazing incidence X-ray optics have been made from highly polished metallic mirrors, \nwhich are generally used in one of two optical geometries. The first of these was originally conceived by \nKirkpatrick and Baez (1948) but was first proposed as a suitable optical system for X-rays by Schmidt \n(1975). This optical system is illustrated in Figure 1.3. Angel (1979) later derived an optical geometry, \ninspired by the eye of the squat lobster, in which separate, flat, orthogonal planes, used to approximate the \nKirkpatrick-Baez lens geometry could be brought together in the form of a single, small, square channel. \nAn array of these square channels could then be used as a telescope, and if the axes of these channels \nwere normal to the surface of a sphere of radius R then a telescope with a maximum theoretical field of \nview of 4\u03c0 sr could be constructed. This optical arrangement has come to be known as the Lobster\u2019s eye \noptic and is illustrated in one plane in Figure 1.4. The focal plane of a lobster\u2019s eye optic is the surface of \na sphere with centre of curvature coincident with that of the optic, but with a radius of curvature of R\/2. \nMCPs with square microchannels and which have been slumped into sections of a sphere of radius R can \nbe used to provide this lobster\u2019s eye geometry. Images produced by an MCP lobster\u2019s eye lens were first \nreported by Fraser et al. (1993). \n \nUnlike a true Kirkpatrick-Baez system, the reflecting surfaces of the microchannels are not ellipsoidal but \nflat. The channels are short enough, however, that the resultant broadening of the focus is small. It has \nbeen by shown by Chapman et al., (1991) that a lens employing channels of length L will produce a depth \nof focus equal to 2L.  \n \n 4\n \nFigure 1.3. The Kirkpatrick-Baez optical system. Grazing incidence from two orthogonal ellipsoidal \nmirrors is used to produce a point focus for a ray from infinity (single reflections from only one mirror \nproduce a line focus). \n \nA slumped MCP optic in a lobster\u2019s eye configuration obeys the lens equation (Chapman et al., 1991), \nSI LLR\n112 +=  ,               (1.2) \nwhere LI is the distance from the optic to the focus and LS is the distance from the optic to the X-ray \nsource. \n \n \n \nFigure 1.4. Configuration (in one dimension) of a lobster\u2019s eye X-ray telescope. The paths of two rays \nfrom a point source at infinity, incident at different points on the optic, through the optical system are \nshown. \n \nTo date all X-ray telescopes have used a reflection geometry based on coaxial, confocal sections in \noptical arrangements first proposed by Wolter (1952a and 1952b). In the most frequently employed \ngeometry (type I of three proposed by Wolter) X-rays are focussed by successive reflections from the \ninside surfaces of first a paraboloid of rotation and then a hyperboloid of rotation illustrated in Figure 1.5. \nWolter type I optical systems for space applications were first demonstrated during sounding rocket \n 5\nflights in 1977 (Rappaport et al., 1979) and have since been employed by X-ray observatories including \nExosat, Einstein, Rosat, ASCA, XMM-Newton and Chandra. To obtain high effective areas the optics are \ncomprised of multiple macroscopic mirror shells, which in the majority of cases are highly polished, \nmetal coated, metal or ceramic structures nested concentrically. These mirror modules are expensive to \nfabricate and have large masses. Foil mirrors have been employed on observatories such as ASCA, in a \nconical approximation to the Wolter Geometry. \n \n \nFigure 1.5. Illustration of a Wolter type I optical setup. \n \nA single conic section at grazing incidence has a very small effective area and so concentric shells are \nused. Such a nested shell Wolter type I optic of the type used on the XMM Newton X-ray observatory is \nshown in Figure 1.6a. This optic has a diameter of 700 cm and consists of 58 nested mirror shells. Three \nsuch optics are employed by XMM-Newton, each with a mass of 425 kg (de Chambure et al., 1999). \n \nMCP optics can also be applied in a conic approximation to a Wolter type I grazing incidence optic by \nusing successive reflections in two square pore, circular packed MCP optics shown in Figure 1.6b \n(Willingale et al., 1998). The microchannel packing and lens geometry of such an optic is shown in \nFigure 1.7. The MCPs are slumped and stacked such that concentric rings of microchannels form conic \napproximations to the true Wolter geometry. Figure 1.6b shows a square pore, radially packed MCP optic. \nMCP Wolter optics have a narrow field of view and a resolution which is limited by the flat wall \napproximation to the Wolter geometry. This telescope geometry is examined in detail in Chapter 4. By \nreducing the separation of the concentric mirror shells to the micrometer scale the number of shells \nemployed can be very large resulting in large effective areas from small geometric areas and small \nmasses. This mass and area saving, coupled with the high available effective areas make MCP Wolter \noptics ideal for planetary missions. \n 6\n \nFigure 1.6 a). An XMM-Newton nested Wolter type I mirror module (image courtesy of ESA). b). A \nsquare pore radially packed MCP optic. \n \nThe development of MCP Wolter optics has been supported by the ESA Technology Research \nProgramme (TRP) since 1996 (ESA internal report, 1995). X-ray imaging in the laboratory with \nmicrochannel plate Wolter optics, produced as a result of the ESA TRP, has been reported by Willingale \net al. (1998) and the first instrument to use these new optics will be the Mercury Imaging X-ray \nSpectrometer (MIXS) on the European BepiColombo Mission to Mercury.   \n \n \nFigure 1.7. Packing geometry and two MCP optic Wolter type I configuration (after Price, 2001) \n \nA figure of merit F can be defined for an X-ray telescope as the ratio of effective area in cm2 to mass in \nkg (Fraser, 1997). For a conventional X-ray telescope F ~ 1-10, whilst for a lobster\u2019s eye MCP X-ray \ntelescope F ~ 1000. For an MCP Wolter optic F ~ 200. A typical MCP optic will have a channel diameter \nof 20\u00b5m, so a large number of channels can be packed within a given optic area providing a large \ncollecting\/reflecting area whilst maintaining a very low mass. MCP optics, in both optical configurations, \n 7\ntherefore offer a significant mass advantage over conventional X-ray telescopes. This makes such optics \nideal for space applications, where high performance is required but mass is at a premium, particularly to \nplanetary science, where conventional X-ray optics have been impractical and prohibitively expensive.  \n1.3.1 Applications of MCP X-ray optics \nThe development of MCP optics for X-ray imaging has generated new research possibilities in astronomy \nand planetary science. Some of these possibilities will be realised in the next decade on missions for \nwhich MCP optics are a key technology. \n1.3.1.1 All sky observing \nThe wide field of view and low mass of MCP optics in a lobster\u2019s eye configuration can be used to image \nthe entire sky in X-rays (Fraser et al., 2002). An instrument of this type is being developed to provide all \nsky X-ray imaging from a Local Vertical Local Horizontal (LVLH) orbital platform such as the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) where the same spacecraft faces are always nadir, ram and wake \npointing.  \n \nOriginally intended as an external payload for the European Columbus module of the ISS, Lobster uses \nsix separate modules of MCP optics in a lobster\u2019s eye configuration. Each of these modules has a field of \nview (FOV) of 27\u00b0 x 22.5\u00b0 providing a total instantaneous FOV of 162\u00b0 x 22.5\u00b0 (Fraser et al., 2002). As \nthe ISS orbits the Earth every 90 minutes the instrument FOV sweeps out the entire sky. Figure 1.8 shows \nLobster in place on the ESA Columbus Module of the ISS. Lobster may eventually form part of the \npayload for a free flying spacecraft owing to uncertainties in the construction timetable of the ISS, and the \navailability of other flight opportunities. \n \n \nFigure 1.8. The Lobster all sky X-ray monitor, in the centre of the image, as an attached payload on the \nColumbus module of the ISS. \n 8\n1.3.1.2 Planetary remote sensing \n \nFigure 1.9. Configuration of MIXS-T on BepiColombo Flat MCPs are shown as an approximation. \n \nThe low mass (~0.5kg) and large collecting area (~100cm2) provided by MCP Wolter optics make them \nideal for planetary missions where they can be used to image fluorescent X-ray emission from airless \nplanetary bodies and where mass minimisation is essential. In the inner solar system fluorescent emission \nfrom surfaces results from excitation by incident solar coronal X-rays and solar wind particles. \nSpectroscopy of surface fluorescence from orbiting instruments yields information on the elemental \ncomposition of a body\u2019s surface by the identification and quantification of elemental spectral lines. \nMercury, the Moon, Comets and Asteroids are all suitable targets for this technique, within the inner solar \nsystem (Clarke and Trombka, 1997a) although charge transfer from solar wind particles is the most likely \nsource of emission from comets (Krasnopolsky, 1997). X-ray detection from orbit and elemental \nmapping was demonstrated at the Moon by Apollo 15 and 16 (Adler et al., 1972a,b,c) and the asteroid \n433 Eros (Trombka et al., 2000). Instrumentation is currently in operation at the Moon (Grande et al., \n2001) on Smart-1, is in transit to Mercury (Starr et al., 2001) on MESSENGER and was applied to \nasteroid 1998 SF36 (Itokowa) on Hyabusa (Okada et al., 2000). None of these instruments has an \nimaging capability and all must instead rely on collimators to limit their field of view. The future \napplication of MCP optics will permit true X-ray imaging of planetary surfaces for the first time and \nunprecedented (>200m) surface resolution compared with that achieved by collimated instruments \n(>40km).  \n \nThe first mission to use MCP optics for planetary remote sensing will be the European Space Agency\u2019s \nBepiColombo mission to Mercury, whose launch is intended for 2013. BepiColombo\u2019s X-ray \nspectrometer has been baselined as a two channel instrument, the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer \n 9\n 10\n(MIXS), comprising an imaging telescope (MIXS-T); using MCP optics in a Wolter type I configuration, \nand a novel slumped MCP collimator (MIXS-C). The geometrical design of the MIXS-C collimating \ngeometry channel is described in Chapter 3, and the Wolter type I optical geometry is described in \nChapter 4, which goes on to describe the optimisation and performance of the combined MIXS \ninstrument and its predicted performance at Mercury. MIXS-T\u2019s configuration is illustrated in Figure 1.9. \n1.4 Dust and debris detection \nMCP optics in space will be covered by a thin Al film, to reduce their thermal absorptivity. To investigate \neffects on the optics of exposure to the external ISS environment, in preparation for Lobster, \nrepresentative samples of MCP optics, bearing thin Al films were attached to the ISS exterior for two \nyears, retrieved and returned to the University of Leicester for analysis. Analysis of the samples has given \ninsight into the contamination and deterioration of MCP optics in the ISS environment. A study into \ncontamination effects is reported in Carpenter et al. (2006) and is not included in this thesis. In addition, \nthe thin film is highly sensitive to impacts by interplanetary dust and space debris particles and therefore \nacts as a passive dust detector. Analysis of holes in the exposed films has revealed a new population of \nnanometre scale dust and debris particles in Low Earth Orbit, which is beyond the detection limit of \nprevious dust and debris experiments. The development of future, optimised, passive experiments and a \ncompact, low mass, active detector based on this nanofilm technology will allow the extension of current \nparticle size distributions by more than an order of magnitude.  The analysis of the returned MCP optic \nwitness samples in terms of dust and debris impacts is described in Chapter 5 with a description of an \nactive detector concept based on the thin films but with the addition of an active readout.  \n1.5 Overview of the thesis \nThe following chapters describe work carried out by the author towards the degree of PhD in the period \nSeptember 2002 \u2013 June 2005.  \n \nChapter 2 describes an investigation into the along channel surface composition of MCP detectors using \nenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This investigation reveals structure in the along channel \ncomposition of MCP detectors, which may be related to the reduction in MCP quantum efficiency in the \nextreme ultra violet, which has blighted EUV astronomy in the post 1990 era. In this chapter the \nexperimental design, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) operation, and data analysis was all carried \nout by the author. \n \nChapter 3 describes the process of X-ray fluorescence from planetary surfaces and the mechanisms for \nusing observations of X-ray fluorescence to determine surface composition. This chapter introduces an \nequation describing the X-ray flux from a surface as a function of the incident solar spectrum, surface \ncomposition and the angles of incidence for X-rays and observation. This is a development on an equation \npresented by Clark and Trombka (1997). The derivation of an equation to more accurately represent the \nfundamental parameters was carried out by the author with input from G.W. Fraser. \n \n 11\nChapter 4 describes the design of a novel collimator geometry for application to observations of extended \nX-ray sources like planetary surfaces. The collimator design has particular relevance to the BepiColombo \nmission to Mercury for which it has been adopted as a high throughput X-ray channel on the Mercury \nImaging X-ray Spectrometer. The collimator uses MCPs in a slumped configuration to provide a high X-\nray throughput, which is independent of X-ray energy, whilst having important advantages over the \ncollimator geometries which have been applied previously to planetary remote sensing. The concept, \ndesign, definition and modelling of this collimator is the original work of the author. \n \nChapter 5 describes the optimisation of the collimated MIXS-C and imaging MIXS-T channels for \nBepiColombo and predicts their performance at Mercury. The MIXS-T MCP optics are modelled using a \nMonte Carlo raytrace model, originally developed by G.Price and A.Brunton and modified by the author \nto account for the varying geometries of the instrument and optic coatings. Absorption and quantum \nefficiency calculations have been carried out by the author. A model of surface fluorescence due to \nincident solar coronal X-rays is then used to predict the X-ray flux from Mercury. The model has been \ndeveloped by A. King, P. Warren and A. Brunton and subsequently modified by the author to use the \nmodified fluorescence equation and the various compositional models of Chapter 3. The calculated X-ray \nfluxes are folded through the predicted effective areas for both instrument channels to quantify and \npredict the instrument\u2019s performance during the BepiColombo mission. A subsequent comparison of \nmodelled fluorescence from the Moon with real observations by the Chandra X-ray observatory is then \npresented to demonstrate the validity of the flux model used in the calculations. The modification of the \nraytrace model, application for MIXS optimisation, modification and application of the fluorescence \nmodel, modelling of Chandra observations and modelling of the slumped collimator in the context of \nMIXS has all been carried out by the author. The derivation of the grasp equations and the technique \napplied for the calculation of grasp from raytraced effective areas and vignetting curves are also the \nauthor\u2019s own work. \n \nChapter 6 describes an analysis of MCP optics exposed to the space environment on the ISS, initially to \nassess the effects of the environment on the optics. Impact features in the 60 nm thick films are described \nand flux values determined for the nanometre sized particles detected by the MCPs during the exposure. \nThis serendipitous method of dust detection has unprecedented sensitivity and offers a means of \nextending the range of dust measurements in the solar system by more than an order of magnitude. \nPreliminary work towards the development of an active dust detector, which is based on the thin film \ntechnology, is then described. All post-flight analysis of the samples including Field Electron Gun (FEG) \nSEM imaging (compositional and residue analyses have been carried out with support and facilities of \nAnton Kearsley and the Natural History Museum, London), data analysis, flux modelling, realisation of \nfilmed MCPs as dust detectors and development of the active detector concept in this chapter have been \ncarried out by the author.   \n \n 12\nIn the final chapter conclusions are drawn from the work described in the thesis and possibilities for MCP \ntechnology in astronomy and planetary science in the near and more distant future is discussed.  \nCHAPTER 2 \n \n2 Compositional Analysis of Microchannel Plates Using \nEnergy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy \n \n2.1 Introduction \nRecent MCP detectors have been found to have disappointing quantum efficiency (QE) (~1-5% \n(Bannister, 2001)) at Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) wavelengths between 100 and 1000 \u00c5 (120-12eV) \ncompared to plates from the pre 1990 Extreme Ultra-Violet Explorer (EUVE) and Rosat Wide Field \nCamera era (~8-20% (Kowalski et al., 1986; Hemphill et al., 1997; Jelinsky et al., 1996; Bannister et al, \n2000)). The cause of this, apparently global and manufacturer independent, (Jelinsky et al., 1996 \nSiegmund et al., 1996) change in efficiency is presently unknown, but is most likely to be due to changes \nin the surface chemistry of the processed MCPs.  \n \nPhotons entering a microchannel interact with the glass of the channel wall via the photoelectric effect. \nThe resulting photoelectron and\/or Auger electron (electrons stimulated by a fluorescent X-ray released \nfrom an inner shell following photoionisation) may escape into the microchannel accompanied by the \nejection of one or more secondary electrons. The mean energy required to excite one secondary \nphotoelectron in MCP glass is 10 eV and the escape length in MCP glass is just 33 \u00c5 (Fraser 1983). The \nmost probable number of electrons to escape into a microchannel is always one, regardless of photon \nenergy (Fraser and Pearson, 1984), and as a result MCPs have very little intrinsic energy resolution in \nthe soft X-ray band.  \n \nFigure 2.1. Photon at normal incidence to the front surface of an MCP with channel bias angle \u03b8. \n \nThe soft X-ray QE of MCPs is examined theoretically by Fraser (1982) and experimentally by Pearson \n(1984). For energies of less than ~8 keV interactions between photons and the MCP glass typically occur \nwithin a few \u00b5m of the channel surface, dependent on grazing angle. For EUV photons incident normally \n 13\non an MCP detector with a bias angle \u03b8, shown in Figure 2.1, the characteristic interaction depth beneath \nthe surface has an upper limit at \n( )\u03b8\u00b5 sin1\u2212=id ,                           (2.1) \nwhere \u00b5 is the linear absorption coefficient derived from the complex refractive index and described in \nChapter 5. For a typical MCP bias angle of 5\u00b0 the interaction depth ~70 \u00c5 for 100 eV photons. \n \nFigure 2.2. Secondary electron yield as a function of primary electron energy for normal incidence on to \nMCP glass, from Hill (1973). \n \nIn general, for soft X-rays and EUV photons, QE decreases with increasing energy because the photon \nabsorption depth increases and the probability of electrons escaping is reduced  (Fraser, 1989). Figure 2.2 \nshows the secondary electron yield from MCP glass as a function of primary electron energy for normal \nelectron incidence from Hill (1976). As photon energy is increased there is a decreased probability that an \nelectron avalanche will result from an initial photon strike. A first order approximation is to assume that \nthe outcome of the avalanche is wholly determined by the first collision of the photoelectron batch with \nthe channel walls (Smith and Pounds, 1968). An additional effect for EUV photons is an increased \nprobability of reflection from the microchannel surface at grazing incidence compared with X-rays. \nFigure 2.3 shows reflectivity as a function of grazing angle from silica (as an approximation to MCP \nglass) for 50 eV, 100 eV and 500 eV photons. The increased probability of reflection upon first strike \nwith the channel walls, for EUV photons, may result in electron liberation occurring further along the \nmicrochannel\u2019s length. \n \nSome possible explanations for the reduced QE at EUV energies and not for soft X-rays are as follows: \n\u2022 The quantum efficiency reduction has occurred following a change in bulk MCP glass composition. \nDifferent MCP manufacturers, however, use different MCP glass compositions but have experienced \nsimilar losses of QE and so this mechanism seems unlikely. \n\u2022 Some change in the MCP manufacturing process has resulted in a compositional change at very \nshallow depths into the glass surface, where EUV photons are likely to interact. This change has \n 14\nresulted in decreased secondary electron yield at these depths. X-rays by virtue of their increased \nenergy, relative to EUV photons, will interact at greater depths and are therefore largely unaffected.  \n\u2022 By virtue of the increased reflection probability at grazing incidence, compared with X-rays, EUV \nphotons interact further along the microchannel following an initial reflection. A change in the along \nchannel elemental composition may then result in a reduced QE at these energies. \n \n \nFigure 2.3. Reflectivity as a function of grazing angle from silica for50  eV, 100  eV and 500  eV photons \ncalculated for a semi infinite surface by the X-ray reflectivity calculator (http:\/\/www-\ncxro.lbl.gov\/optical_constants\/). \n  \nAn investigation has been carried out into the composition of microchannels in a number of \u201chigh \nefficiency\u201d and \u201clow efficiency\u201d MCPs. A Philips XL30 scanning electron microscope (SEM), in the \nEngineering Department at the University of Leicester, was used to provide X-ray fluorescence spectra \nand hence elemental compositions. These spectra were recorded with an Oxford ISIS 310 Si(Li) light- \nelement analysis detector. Variations in the X-ray spectra as a function of channel length from both sets \nof MCPs are described in this Chapter and may provide insight into the nature of the \u201clost efficiency\u201d \nproblem. \n2.2 MCP Manufacture and Electron Emission \nMCP manufacture is a complex process and the resultant glass chemistry is not perfectly understood. Any \nobserved differences in the composition of glass from MCPs with good and poor QE will have \nimplications for manufacturing processes. There follows a summary of the manufacturing process based \non a Mullard (now Photonis SAS, Brive) internal report by Smith (1994), and previous observations of \nMCP glass composition.  \n \nMicrochannel plates are made from a cladding glass type developed to provide a specific conductivity and \nsecondary electron emission coefficient. The main stages of manufacture of MCPs from this glass in a \n 15\n\u2018two draw\u2019 process are shown in Figure 2.4. Initially a cylinder of cladding glass and a core made from \nacid soluble core glass are manufactured, such that the soluble core fits closely into the cladding tube. \nThis core prevents collapse and distortion of the channels during the later fusion stages. The core and \ncladding glasses must have compatible thermal expansion and viscosity coefficients, and diffusion \n(mixing of the two glass types at their interface) must be minimised.  \n \nOnce assembled this billet, approximately 35 mm in diameter, is slowly drawn vertically through an oven. \nThe cladding collapses onto the core and the diameter of the composite fibre is reduced to around 0.8mm. \nThe oven temperature is closely controlled and air turbulence is avoided. \n \nThe emerging fibre is then cut into lengths, which are stacked into a hexagonal mould. The mould is \nheated, causing the fibres to fuse into a single hexagonal array, which is drawn for a second time. This \nproduces a hexagonal multifibre, approximately 0.85 mm in diameter, with channels containing the acid \nsoluble glass, between 3.2 and 25 \u00b5m in diameter, depending upon the MCP requirement.  \n \n \nFigure 2.4. Processes in microchannel plate manufacture (courtesy Photonis SAS, Brive) \n \nA number of multifibre lengths are then stacked into a hexagonal glass capsule and fused under vacuum \nso that the cladding glass flows to fill the small spaces between the fibres. This results in a single solid \n 16\n 17\nglass composite boule, which is sliced either perpendicular to the channels or at an angle to introduce a \nbias to the channels.  \n \nThe slices are then ground to the required size and shape, polished and acid etchant is used to remove the \nsoluble glass cores. In the case of MCP detectors (but not MCP optics) the remaining glass plates are then \nbaked in a hydrogen atmosphere at around 633 K to reduce the surface and produce a resistive layer with \nthe required secondary emission characteristics. For MCP detectors, metallic electrodes (usually \nnichrome, Ni7Cr2Fe3) are vacuum deposited on to the polished faces of the plates where they act as \nelectrodes, connecting all of the channels in parallel. \n \nFor large MCPs (>46 mm diameter) a ram-fusion technique is employed. Here, multifibres are stacked \nand a mould is placed on an anvil in an oven and a close fitting top plate is inserted. At the required \ntemperature the ram is used to put the multifibres under pressure and fuse them together.  \n \nThe surface chemistry of microchannel plates is highly dependent on the etching and hydrogen baking \nprocesses (Hill, 1973; Siddiqui, 1977; Then and Pantano, 1990). Since the surface chemistry governs the \nelectron emission characteristics of the microchannel it is possible that a subtle change in this process has \noccurred, changing the surface chemistry of MCPs and causing a reduction in QE at EUV energies. \n2.2.1 MCP glass and secondary electron yield \nThe bulk composition of microchannel plate glass can be described by the pseudo molecule \nSi30O82Na5K7BiPb5 (calculated using percentage by mass data for Phillips 3502 glass from Fraser, 1982) \nwith a low abundance of Ba. The addition of lead, bismuth, sodium and potassium to silicate glass \nprovides the required conduction and secondary electron emission (SEE) properties, of particular interest \nhere. QE is dependent on the secondary electron yield (SEY) (Smith and Pounds, 1968), which is \ndependent on the work function and inelastic mean free path of electrons in the glass (Then and Pantano, \n1990), which are in turn dependent on the glass\u2019s composition. Secondary electron emission (SEE) only \noccurs from a region extending to depths of 10s to 100s of Angstroms and is therefore highly dependent \non the surface composition and not that of the bulk glass.  \n \nPrevious workers have shown that, after etching and reduction in hydrogen, the composition of MCP \nglass at shallow depths can depart considerably from the bulk formula (Then and Pantano, 1990; Hill, \n1976; Siddiqui, 1977). At depths extending to a maximum of ~5 \u00b5m there is a semi-conducting medium \nin which reduction of PbO during hydrogen baking produces Pb metal within the glass. Above this region \nis a layer in which Pb is depleted. In glass containing K this only appears after both etching and then \nhydrogen baking. In glasses containing Cs, instead of K, hydrogen baking alone appears sufficient to \nproduce this layer (Then and Pantano, 1990). The Pb depleted region has been found to extend to depths \nof 100 \u00c5 \u2013 200 \u00c5 in MCP detector glass (Siddiqui, 1977). The reflectivity of MCP optics has been found \nto fit a model of X-ray reflectivity in which the MCP glass was modelled as a layer of silica 350 \u00c5 \u2013 400 \n\u00c5 thick on a substrate with a standard MCP composition. Finally a surface region, still depleted of Pb and \nextending to around 10 nm, is rich in alkali species, in particular potassium. These are drawn from 20 nm-\n50 nm below, where they are found to be depleted. Figure 2.5 shows the different compositional layers in \nMCP glass. \n \nAlkali metals are added to the glass in order to give it the required softening and annealing temperatures. \nTheir abundant presence at the surface, however, particularly for K, will have a strong influence on the \nelectron yield. K is an electropositive metal, which is readily ionised to form a dipole at the surface, \nreducing the potential barrier across the surface and resulting in an increased escape probability and \nhigher SEY (Hill, 1973).  \n \n \nFigure 2.5. Diagram of the different layers in etched and reduced MCP detector glass. \n \nAlso observed at the surface (to a depth of 0.2 \u2013 0.5 \u00b5m) is hydrogen, which enters the glass during the \nreduction process and whose presence at the surface has been shown to increase SEY (Then and Pantano, \n1990). Other contaminants detected at the surface include C, S, and Ca (Hill, 1973). Any Ca, Ba and Al \ndetected in the MCPs will have originated in the core glass and migrated into the MCP (Fairbend, 2005). \n \nThe composition and structure described here has been deduced by previous workers from analysis of \nbulk microchannel plate glass samples using ion-scattering spectroscopy (ISS), secondary ion mass \nspectroscopy (SIMS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The samples analysed, however, were not \nMCPs but bars cut from the bulk glass and subsequently processed chemically in the same way as an \nMCP. The structures in composition observed in these glass bars may differ from those of actual MCPs, \nas a consequence of processes, not directly related to the chemistry of chemical etching or hydrogen \nreduction, but to the geometry of the microchannels themselves. For example a fluid, such as an etchant \nor hydrogen gas, flowing through a microchannel will have values of velocity, temperature and density \nwhich vary along the channel length and are functions of the scale and geometry of the microchannel and \n 18\n 19\nthe initial properties of the flow as it enters (Agarwai et al. 2001; Roy et al., 2003). Rates of reaction can \ntherefore vary along a microchannel\u2019s length and produce a surface composition which varies along the \nchannel length. Subsequently the SEE characteristics will also vary along the channel length. \n \nThe distinct compositional layers described occur through a combination of etching and reduction in \nhydrogen. If any change in surface composition can be correlated with the QE change then this may \nindicate that modifications to either the etching or reduction processes are responsible for that change. A \nprogramme to regain EUV sensitivity in MCPs could then be undertaken. Comparison of new \ncompositional data from MCP microchannels, with that of previous workers, from MCP glass, may also \nreveal compositional changes resulting from the MCP geometry. \n2.3 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of cleaved MCP fragments \n2.3.1 Measurement of elemental abundance ratio profiles \nFragments of MCP detectors i-v in Table 2.1 were cleaved, by scoring and cracking, to expose their \nmicrochannels. Plates iii-v are considered \u201chigh efficiency\u201d (>~8 %), plates i and ii, \u201clow efficiency\u201d \n(<~8 %) at incident angles of less than 25\u00b0 to the channel axis at a wavelength of 584 \u00c5.  \n \nMCP year of \nmanufacture \nPore diameter \n(\u00b5m) \ni)AXAF FH003-5 1990 12.5 \nii)JPEX DH001-D-1 1998 6 \niii)WFC 344-3 ~1985 12.5 \niv)AB414-1 1981\/2 12.5 \nv)277D-2 ~1980 25 \nTable 2.1. Format, manufacturer and date of manufacture of the MCPs studied. All MCPs were \nmanufactured by Photonis, SAS  (formally Mullard)and have aspect ratio of 120:1. \n \nEnergy Dispersive fluorescent X-ray (EDX) spectra were obtained from ten points along the lengths of \nmicrochannels of each fragment using a 15 kV electron beam accelerating voltage. For some \nmicrochannels, debris from the cleaving process prevented data from being taken at the very ends of the \nmicrochannels and the number of data points along the channel was reduced. The electron spot size is \nmuch smaller than the channel diameter in each case but the precise diameter is not known. The SEM \nelectron beam spot is typically several nanometres in diameter.  \n \n \nFigure 2.6a. Arrangement of the microchannels and detector in Configuration 1. The passage of some \nfluorescent X-rays in the direction of the detector will be blocked by the microchannel wall. \n \nFigure 2.6b. Arrangement of the microchannels and detector in Configuration 2. The microchannel walls \nare orientated so as to minimise any occultation of the fluorescent X-rays in the direction of the detector. \n \nX-ray spectra were recorded in two configurations for each MCP. In the original Configuration 1 the long \naxes of the microchannels are orientated at approximately 45\u00b0 to the detector in the x-z plane shown in \nFigure 2.6a. This Configuration was better suited to the measurement of distances along the channel \nlengths with the SEM software as the microchannel long and perpendicular axes ran parallel to the SEM\u2019s \ndefault stage axes. In this configuration however it was noted that count rates were generally low and \ncould vary significantly at different locations. The low fluxes were believed to result from occultation by \nthe channel wall of the line of sight from the spot under analysis to the detector. Variability in the count \nrates was taken to be the result of variations in the height of the channel wall along a channel\u2019s length. \nFigure 2.7 shows a SEM image of a section of cleaved microchannel plate. No data were taken where \nexcessive occultation by the wall was likely. To account for any affect this geometry may have had on the \ndetected fluxes, data were later taken in Configuration 2, in which the microchannels were aligned with \nthe detector in the in the x-z plane, as shown in Figure 2.6b.  \n \n 20\n \nFigure 2.7. SEM image of microchannels in a cleaved MCP. The image shows the irregular nature of the \nwall height and shape, and hence the microscopic geometry of the cleaving process. \n \nX-ray emission lines were identified and the number of events under each elemental peak estimated. To a \ngood approximation the line intensity is proportional to the product of the fluorescent yield and the \nelemental concentration. Thus, dividing the counts under a peak by the fluorescence yield for the given \nelement gives a measure of the element\u2019s concentration. \n \nSiO2 forms the glass structure; it was assumed that the absolute Si abundance everywhere in the glass was \nconstant. For this reason, the number of counts for each elemental line is expressed as a fraction of the \nnumber of counts in the Si peak at the same location and then scaled to a peak value of one. This \nnormalisation process allows for comparison of different spectra, removing any variations in the number \nof counts resulting directly from changes to the measurement geometry. This has been the approach \ntraditionally used to remove geometrical effects from X-ray fluorescence (XRF) observations of planetary \nsurfaces (Clark and Trombka, 1997a), where, as with MCP glass here, elemental abundances are \nexpressed after normalisation to Si. \n \nThe elements expected in the MCP glass are: O, Na, Si, Al, K, Ca, Ba, Bi and Pb, with Ni, Fe and Cr \nexpected from the electrode material. Normalised relative abundances of the elements to silicon, taken \nalong the microchannels were then combined to produce along channel abundance profiles for MCPs with \nboth \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d QE at EUV energies. \n 21\n2.4 Relative abundance profiles \n \nFigure 2.8. A representative spectrum taken from inside the entrance of an MCP i (Table 2.1) \nmicrochannel, uncorrected for fluorescent yield. Electron beam accelerating voltage was 15 kV and \nintegration time was 100 s. See Chapter 3 for details on X-ray nomenclature. \n \nThe main lines observed were the K-shell emission lines of oxygen, sodium, aluminium, silicon, calcium \nand potassium as well as the L shell lines from barium and the M-shell emission from lead and bismuth. \nIn some spectra, traces of carbon were observed, which was assumed to be a contaminant (Hill, 1973). \nFigure 2.8 shows a representative spectrum from the entrance to MCP i. The integration time for each \nspectrum was 100 s. \n \nIn Configuration 1 each MCP displayed apparently periodic variations in the abundance of elements \nalong  microchannels. Figure 2.9 shows the Configuration 1 along channel profiles relative to Si-K for \nNa-K, O-K, K-K and Pb-M for MCP iii. In Configuration 2 count rates were observed to be generally \nhigher and far more consistent as functions of position along a microchannel. The structure and \nperiodicity in the along channel elemental profiles produced in Configuration 1 were found to be reduced \nor absent in the profiles produced in Configuration 2. Figure 2.10 shows the along channel profiles \nproduced in Configuration 2 for MCP iii.   \n \nWhere elemental profiles have been taken with Configuration 1 some elements can be separated into \ngroups, whose profiles show similar structure. Na and O form a pair, both of which have K-line X-ray \nlines with energies lower than Si-K and which share almost identical profile shapes. Another pair, K and \nPb, whose K-line (and M-line for Pb and Bi) energies are greater than Si-K and which also share profiles \nwith similar shapes but with opposing phase to those of Na and O. This pairing applies to all the MCPs \nexamined, although there is variation in the profile shape. The profile of Al also varies as a function of \nmicrochannel length but in a manner inconsistent with the other elements. The Al-K line is believed to be \ndominated by Al in the SEM structure and not by Al in the MCP glass and is therefore an artefact. Ba is \npresent only in small quantities; introducing large uncertainties in the relative abundances measured, and \n 22\nis not shown. In Configuration 2 variations in the along channel profiles of Pb and O remain small while \nfor the highly mobile Na and K surface species the along channel abundance is more variable, but \nreduced from that observed in Configuration 1. \n \n \nFigure 2.9. Along channel profiles for MCP (iii) in Configuration 1. \n \n \nFigure 2.10. Along channel elemental profiles for MCP(iii) in Configuration 2. \n  \n2.5 Occultation and relative abundance \nThe large scale structure observed in along channel elemental profiles was only observed where \nmicrochannel walls were orientated so as to provide some obstruction in the line of sight between the \ndetector and the spot under examination. This configuration also led to a general reduction in X-ray count \n 23\nrate. Normalising to silicon should remove any geometrical effects resulting from this occultation and \nresult in profiles whose shapes match those taken in Configuration 2, but this was not found to be the \ncase, suggesting that there is some energy dependency to the flux reduction following occultation. This is \nsupported by the groupings of the low energy O and Na profiles and the higher energy Pb and K profiles, \nwhich appear out of phase with each other in Configuration 1.  \n \n \nFigure 2.11. SEM Secondary Electron image of the spot on MCP iii at which spectra were taken with \nvarious angles of orientation towards the detector. Surface charging has resulted from the repeated \nexposure to the electron beam. This can be seen as a bright spot indicating surface charging around the \nlocation from which spectra were taken. \n \nTo quantify the effect of obstruction of line of sight on spectra from the same position, spectra were \naccumulated from a single location along an MCP iii microchannel as the fragment was rotated through \n180\u00b0 in 13 increments. By doing this, occultation by the microchannel wall was varied between its \nminimum (microchannels orientated towards the detector in x-z) and its maximum (microchannels \norientated perpendicular to the detector in x-z). The walls are expected to be ~ 12.5 \u00b5m in height (half the \nchannel diameter). The position of the examination spot was the same in each case at the very centre of \nthe microchannel as viewed from above with the SEM\u2019s secondary electron imager. Surface charging \naround the spot under observation became evident in secondary electron images after repeated exposure \nto the 15 keV electron beam and is visible after completion of the measurements in Figure 2.11 as a bright \narea. Charging may have affected the local composition of the MCP glass and particularly the abundances \n 24\nof the highly mobile Na and K atoms.     \n \nFigure 2.12. The geometry of the MCP channels in the SEM. \n \nThe geometry of a measurement in both x-z and y-z planes is shown in Fig 2.12 for the case where the \nmicrochannel\u2019s axis subtends an angle \u03b8 in the x-z plane and an angle \u03a6 in the y-z plane to the line \nconnecting the examination spot and X-ray detector. If a microchannel has a diameter 2r, the cleaved \nwalls of a microchannel have a height r and the centre of the examination spot is the origin (x=0, y=0, \nz=0) then a line defining the summit of the channel wall can be described by the equations \nry\nrx\n=\n=\n                 (2.2) \nand the line connecting the X-ray detector and examination spot is defined by the equations \n\u03b8tan\ntan\nzx\nzy\n=\n\u03a6=\n.                (2.3) \nThe point P at which the line of sight from the detector to the spot grazes the channel wall (i.e. line of \nsight becomes unobscured by the wall) occurs at \n\u03a6=\u03b8 .                (2.4) \nFor this experiment the region in which the line of sight is unobscurred, and for which X-ray fluxes will \nbe large compared with the fluxes at other angles, will have a full width half maximum equal to 2\u03a6. \n2.6 Line intensities with varying occultation \nFigure 2.13 shows the variation in counts for the principal elements observed, during 100 s integrations, \nas a function of angle as MCP (iii) was rotated through 180\u00b0. The number of counts has been scaled to a \npeak value of one for each element and not normalised to silicon. A low number of counts were observed \nfor the Na-K line which resulted in large uncertainties and so values for Na-K have not been shown here.  \n 25\n \nFigure 2.13. Counts scaled to a peak value of one for certain observed X-ray lines as a function of \norientation with respect to the X-ray  detector in the SEM. Also shown are the normalised abundance \nratios of O\/Si and Pb\/Si as a function of orientation. \n \nThe general effect of the occultation is to produce minima in the X-ray flux which rises sharply to a peak \nas the channel walls are orientated towards the detector as described in Section 2.5. The FWHM of the \npeaked region is 45\u00b0 corresponding to a line of sight grazing angle of 22.5\u00b0. The individual responses of \nthe elemental lines differ. With no occultation the normalised intensity of all the observed lines \napproaches 1. The K-K intensity can be seen to fall off more rapidly beyond this than other lines. This \nmay result from the retreat of K from the surface in reaction to the build up of charge following repeated \nelectron bombardment. A similar effect may explain the low count rates for Na.  \n \nIn the region of occultation the lines diverge. While the higher X-ray energy Si-K, Pb-M, and K-K X-ray \nlines are grouped closely together, the lower energy O-K line maintains a slightly higher relative \nintensity. Figure 2.13 also shows the normalised ratios of O\/Si and Pb\/Si. The O\/Si ratio shows a general \nincrease in value in the region of occultation with a decrease in value where occultation is completely \nremoved. In contrast occultation has no clear effect on the Pb\/Si ratio. \n2.7 Origins of the along channel profiles \nThe X-rays detected after emission from the surface spot under analysis provide information on the glass \ncomposition at the depth at which they were generated. The probability that a detected X-ray originated at \na given depth is a function of the energy lost by the electron beam and the escape probability of the X-\nrays from that depth.  \n  \n 26\nThe empirical continuous slowing down approximation (CSDA) (Burke et al., 1977) for electron ranges \nin materials can be used to calculate the range of electrons in MCP glass. The CSDA range (Rs) in g cm-2 \nis given by  \nn\ns bEkR )( += ,               (2.5) \nwhere E is electron energy in keV, \nZn 310698.1715.1 \u2212\u00d7\u2212= ,              (2.6) \nwhere Z is the atomic number of the surface into which electrons are penetrating,  \n)110659.2(7121.06868.0 2 +\u00d7\u2212= \u2212 Zb \u03c1 ,                        (2.7) \nwhere \u03c1 is the material density in g cm-3 and  \nn\ns\nbE\nR\nk\n)(\n10,\n+=                 (2.8) \nwhere E is the electron energy in keV and Rs,10 is the electron range for 10 keV electrons in the material in \nunits of g cm-2 (which are used here by convention) given by, \n46\n10, 10566.210824.6\n\u2212\u2212 \u00d7+\u00d7= ZRs              (2.9) \n \nAssuming a uniform composition described by the pseudo molecule in Section 2.2.1, which has a mean Z \nof 13.95, a CSDA range of 2.1 \u00b5m is calculated for 15 keV electrons. X-rays must therefore originate less \nthan 2.1\u00b5m from the surface. An integrated flux of X-rays generated at all depths between 0 and 2.1 \u00b5m \nwill be observed at the detector. The X-ray flux contribution from a given depth is a function of the X-ray \nescape probability at that depth. \n \nBeer\u2019s law gives the intensity of X-rays I at a given distance x in a material as \nxeII \u00b5\u2212= 0 ,                        (2.10) \nwhere I0 is the intensity of X-rays before attenuation by the material and \u00b5 is the linear absorption \ncoefficient calculated from the tabulated values of Cromer and Lieberman (1970), to be 2811 cm-1 for K-\nK X-rays in MCP glass and 25061 cm-1 for O-K X-rays. The probability P of an X-ray escaping from a \ndepth x in a material is given by  \nxeP \u00b5\u2212= .                                                (2.11) \n \nThe X-ray escape probability for K-K X-rays from a depth of 2.1 \u00b5m is calculated to be 0.55. \nConsequently a contribution to the observed K-K flux will be from the bulk glass. The majority of \nsecondary electron yield occurs <10 nm from the surface (Then and Pantano, 1990) but this region is too \nshallow to be isolated by this EDXS technique. An electron beam with energy <2.3 keV would have a \npenetration depth appropriate to this important region but would not provide fluorescence from most of \nthe elements of interest.  \n \n 27\nMeasurements of Pb-K and K-K X-rays are therefore dominated by fluorescence from the bulk glass but \nfor O-K and Na-K X-rays this is not the case. Figure 2.14 shows the X-ray escape probability curves of \nK-K and O-K X-rays from MCP glass. Measurements of the O-K and Na-K X-ray flux will be dominated \nby emission from close to the surface. Changes observed in the O-K and Na-K lines may indicate a wider \ncompositional change including elements for which the X-ray flux is dominated by emission from the \nbulk glass and for which small changes at the surface will not be observed. \n \n \nFigure 2.14. Escape probability with depth for O-K and K-K X-rays in MCP glass calculated with \nEquation 2.11 for an MCP glass composition given in Section 2.1.1. \n \nThe profiles may be a result of a change in composition of one of the layers in the MCP glass near to the \nsurface or may be the result of changes to the thickness of the individual layers as a function of along \nchannel position. To determine a probable mechanism for the generation of the observed profiles a \nprogramme of modelling is needed to investigate the different options. The energy loss of electrons \nthrough scattering and the subsequent generation of X-rays by fluorescence as a function of depth is a \ncomplex process, best modelled through a Monte Carlo approach. Such a study is beyond the scope of \nthis chapter but may provide a future mechanism for investigation.  \n \nThe change of line intensity, of fluorescent X-ray lines observed in Configuration 1, due to obscuration of \nthe fluorescent X-ray flux by the channel wall has been shown to have an energy dependency. Lower \nenergy X-rays from MCP glass show a decreased intensity loss when obscured by the cleaved \nmicrochannel wall. The O-K line shows an increase in relative intensity of approximately 30% compared \nwith that of higher energy Si-K, Pb-M, and K-K X-rays. This increase in relative intensity for O-K may \n 28\nresult from an increased probability of reflection from the microchannel wall or may result from \nsecondary fluorescence following interactions of higher energy X-rays with the channel walls. These \nvariations in relative intensities of elements of different energies and for different extents of occultation \nsuggests that the structures observed in the Configuration 1 relative abundance profiles, were in fact \nartefacts of the changing shape and height of the occulting microchannel wall and are not related to a \nchange in the along-channel composition of the MCP glass. Only profiles obtained in Configuration 2 can \ntherefore be considered. In these profiles periodic structure, all be it reduced from that in Configuration 1, \nis still observed, particularly for the highly mobile alkali metal Na. \n \nFigure 2.15. Along channel profiles of the Na\/Si counts ratio for all five MCPs. MCPs with good QE are \nred. MCPs with poor QE are blue. \n \nFigure 2.16. Along channel profiles of the K\/Si counts ratio for all five MCPs. MCPs with good QE are \nred. MCPs with poor QE are blue. \n \n 29\nFigures 2.15 and 2.16 show the along channel count ratios of Na\/Si and K\/Si measured in Configuration 2 \nfor all five MCPs. MCPs with high QE are red those with low QE are blue. No correlation can be made \nbetween the along channel profiles made in this Configuration and the MCP quantum efficiency. Periodic \nand helicoidal structures of pure Si crystals have also been observed in SEM images of MCP \nmicrochannels by the manufacturer Photonis, SAS (Brive) and an example image is shown in Figure 2.17. \nThey are a common side effect of subtleties in a sol-gel process during manufacturing but their formation \nis poorly understood. The structures observed independently here in the Configuration 2 measurements \nmay have a similar origin. It may be that even when the silicon crystalline structures are successfully \navoided a similar process affects the channel composition. The formation of the crystalline structures is \none of the biggest problems affecting deep pore etching processes. Recent work by Siegmund et al. \n(2005) has indicated that some QE can be recovered by a reduction in the etch time following a reduction \nin the lengths of the microchannels used.  \n \nAdditional support for an along channel composition related origin for the QE loss comes from Bannister \n(2001) who presents pulse height distributions (PHDs) for the J-PEX detector MCP (MCP ii) at a \nwavelength of 256 \u00c5. When the MCP QE was measured at normal and reversed orientations (ie. the MCP \nQE was measured, the MCP was turned around and the QE was measured again) the QE was not \nrecovered by turning the MCP around although subtle changes in the PHD shape were observed. This, it \nwas inferred, suggested inhomogeneity in the channel wall composition connected with the poor QE.  \n \nIf the observed structure is related to those generated during the sol-gel process and shown in Figure 2.17 \nthen the sampling in the experiment is unlikely to have had sufficient spatial density (measurements are \nseparated by too great a distance) to resolve any such structure, which in Figure 2.7 has a period of ~D\/4 \n(~3 \u00b5m). The sample period used in the experiment was ~12D. A future study may benefit from \nmeasurements made with an increased spatial density.   \n \n \nFigure 2.17. Periodic and helicodal silicon crystal structures in an MCP microchannel with period ~D\/4, \nwhere D is channel diameter  (image used courtesy of Photonis SAS, Brive). \n 30\n 31\n2.8 Conclusions and further work \nVariations in the along channel surface composition of MCPs have been observed for the first time using \nenergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and is most evident for the alkali metal Na. The structure observed \nin these profiles appears periodic and may be related to periodic crystalline structures which can \nsometimes form during deep pore etching of the MCPs. The loss of MCP QE at EUV energies may be \nrelated to this compositional structure. The profiles observed here cannot be correlated with the QE loss \nbut it is likely that there is insufficient spatial resolution to do so. Changes in surface composition will \naffect the secondary electron emission characteristics of the MCP glass, on which the QE is strongly \ndependent. The alkali metals Na and K are important in determining MCP QE as they form dipoles at the \nglass surface and reduce the potential barrier across the surface, increasing secondary electron yield. \nChanges in the concentration of elements, producing X-rays with higher energies than Na-K may be less \npronounced because their X-ray flux will be dominated by fluorescence from the bulk glass.  \n \nChanges in the along channel composition may affect the EUV QE by altering the composition at \nintermediate channel depths, where by virtue of an increased probability of reflection, secondary electron \nemission for EUV photons is likely to take place, beginning the electron avalanche and dictating the MCP \nQE.  \n \nA future study may use increased spatial resolution to investigate the structure of the compositional \ninhomogeneity and may use complementary analysis techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy \n(AES), which addresses surface and depth analysis, ion-scattering spectroscopy (ISS) for surface analysis, \nand secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) for depth profiling. ISS and SIMS have a key advantage \nover EDXS and AES in that an electron beam, which can potentially affect the surface being studied, is \nnot employed. In addition SIMS allows the detection of hydrogen, the presence of which has been shown \nto impact upon SEY (Hill, 1973).  \n \nAll of the MCPs used in this investigation, have been operated as photomultipliers. Electron \nbombardment, on the walls, during MCP operation and from the SEM electron beam may change the \nsurface glass composition and influence the results of this study. Much of the work described by previous \nauthors used Auger electron spectroscopy of microchannel plate glass (Hill, 1973 and Siddiqui, 1977) and \nthe uncertain influence of electron bombardment lends uncertainty to their results. Changes in surface \ncomposition, structural modification, generation and\/or annihilation of electronic effects, electrical \ncharging and heating are all potential problems (Then and Pantano, 1990). \n \nThe EDXS technique described here gives a new method for the analysis of MCP composition. Structure \nhas been observed in the along channel elemental composition of MCPs, which may offer insight into the \norigin of the lost QE. An understanding and subsequent application of this to MCP manufacture offers a \npotential way forward in solving a problem which has blighted EUV MCP detectors for the last decade. \nCHAPTER 3 \n \n3 X-ray fluorescence from Mercury \n3.1 Introduction \n \n 32\n \nFigure 3.1. Apollo 15 and 16 map of the Aluminium\/Silicon Abundance ratio for equatorial regions of the \nday side of the Moon obtained from X-ray fluorescence measurements made from orbit (image used \ncourtesy of NASA). \n \nAs the innermost planet in the solar system, Mercury represents an extreme case of planetary formation. \nA knowledge of the planet\u2019s history is essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the inner \nSolar System (Clark and Trombka, 1997b). Despite Mercury\u2019s importance it remains the least explored of \nthe planets (apart from Pluto, which is widely accepted to be a Kuiper belt object and not a planet), \nhaving been visited by just one mission, Mariner 10,  which made observations of during three flybys in \n1974 and 1975 (Murray, 1975). Two new missions to Mercury, the US MESSENGER spacecraft (Santo \net al., 2001); launched on 3rd August 2004 and due to enter Mercury orbit in March 2011, and the \nEuropean BepiColombo spacecraft (Anselmi and Scoon, 2001); intended for launch in 2013 and expected \nto arrive at Mercury in 2017, will provide a significant increase in data on the planet, which will allow \nmajor advances in our understanding of the innermost planet and the formation and history of the inner \nSolar System. Both of these missions use X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to generate maps of surface \nelemental composition from orbit around the planet. These data can be used to address key questions on \nMercury\u2019s evolution and the processes which have modified its surface (Clark and Trombka, 1997b). \n \nX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) has been used as a tool for the remote sensing of atmosphereless \nplanetary bodies since the 1970s, when X-rays from the lunar surface were observed from the orbiting \nApollo 15 and 16 service modules (Adler et al., 1972a,b,c and 1975). The resultant X-ray spectra were \nused to generate maps, like that shown in Figure 3.1, of elemental abundance ratios for Mg\/Si and Al\/Si, \nwhich were used as indicators of rock type. Maps were only produced for equatorial regions following the \nservice module\u2019s ground track and observations were necessarily limited to the solar illuminated \nhemisphere as solar coronal X-rays provided the excitation source (Adler et al., 1972b). The detectors \nused were gas proportional counters (GPCs) and the surface resolution was selected by a collimator, \nwhich limited the detector\u2019s field of view (FOV). The technique has since been used for measurements of \nthe surface of asteroid 433 Eros by the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission (Trombka et \nal., 2002), of asteroid Itokawa by the Japanese Hyabusa mission (Okada et al., 2006) and of the Moon by \nthe D-CIXS experiment on SMART-1 (Grande et al., 2001). These instruments and their energy \nresolutions are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5.  \n3.2 X-ray fluorescence from planetary bodies \n \n \nFigure 3.2. Fluorescent X-rays are emitted from elements as outer electrons decay to fill vacancies \ncreated in inner electron shells following photoionisation by X-rays. \n \nThe primary mechanism for producing X-ray fluorescence from planetary bodies in the inner solar system \nis excitation by solar coronal X-rays, though fluorescence can also be induced by bombardment by \ncharged particles. X-rays incident on atoms in the surface excite photoelectron emission from inner \nelectron shells. Electrons from outer shells decay to fill the vacancies as illustrated in Figure 3.2. The \npotential energy lost by the outer electrons as they decay to lower energy levels is emitted as fluorescent \nX-rays. The fluorescent X-rays can either escape from the atom or excite further \u201cAuger\u201d electron \nemission from outer shells. The efficiency of fluorescent X-ray emission is weak compared with Auger \nelectron emission. The energies of X-rays emitted from an element are defined by the changes in energy \nlevels. Fluorescent X-rays from any given element are labelled according to the inner shell from which \nthe primary photoelectron originated, denoted as K,L,M,N, and the number of shells above that, from \nwhich the decaying electron originated; denoted as \u03b1 for one, \u03b2 for two, \u03b3 for three etc. The X-ray \nfrequencies (\u03c5) for series vary with the atomic number Z of the element according to Moseley\u2019s law, \n 33\n)(2\n1\nkZK \u2212=\u03bd  ,                                       (3.1) \nwhere for each spectral series K and k are constants for all elements. \n \nOnly atmosphereless bodies within approximately 3AU of the Sun are subject to solar X-rays of sufficient \nintensity to allow practical observations of fluorescent X-ray emission (Adler and Trombka, 1970, Adler \net al., 1972a). X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy as an observation technique is therefore limited to \nobservations of the Moon, Mercury, asteroids and comets in the inner solar system, although cometary X-\nray emission is generally believed to result primarily from charge exchange between ions in the solar \nwind and cometary gas (Cravens, 1997). Note, however, that X-ray fluorescence has also been observed \nby the Chandra X-ray observatory from the surfaces of Io and Europa in the Jovian system (at ~5AU). In \nthese cases, fluorescence is believed to be induced by bombardment of the satellite surfaces by energetic \n(> 10 keV) H, O, and S ions (Elsner et al., 2002). To date, spectroscopy of these X-ray fluxes, to obtain \ncompositional information about Europa and Io, has not been possible, although it is believed that \nemission is dominated by the K shell emission from oxygen in both cases. \n \nThe intensity of solar induced X-ray fluorescence from a planetary surface at different energies is highly \ndependent on the solar X-ray spectrum and total intensity. Solar X-ray output can change by several \norders of magnitude in energy and overall intensity and is highly variable over time scales of minutes. \nSolar X-ray variability is illustrated by data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite \n(GOES) illustrated in Figure 3.3. The solar X-ray spectrum is also dominated by low energy X-rays with \na typical decrease in flux of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude over the range 1-10 keV for most solar states. \nFigure 3.4 shows the decrease in flux as a function of energy for three solar flare states, M1, C1 and B1. \nAs solar flare state increases there is a general increase in hard X-ray emission. The primary X-ray energy \nrequired to produce secondary fluorescence increases with the atomic number of the target element. The \nenergy of primary radiation must be greater than the energy at the absorption edge of an element in order \nto liberate a photoelectron prior to the generation of a fluorescent X-ray. An increase in solar state is \nassociated with an increase in total X-ray output and the mean energy of the solar spectrum and therefore \nresults in an increase in X-ray emission from planetary surfaces, particularly for high Z elements for \nwhich a higher energy incident flux is required. Consequently, a sun-pointing solar X-ray spectrometer is \nrequired in addition to any surface-pointing X-ray spectrometer to allow analysis of the detected surface \nspectrum with respect to the exciting solar spectrum.  \n 34\n 35\n \nFigure 3.3. Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) X-ray data from 2nd \u2013 5th \nNovember 2003 showing orders of magnitude increases in X-ray intensity over time scales less than \nhours (www.sec.noaa.gov). \n \nFigure 3.4. Power law data fits of Truscott et al. (2000) to the mean solar X-ray spectrum in M1, C1 and \nB1 flare states. Flare states are defined by the total X-ray power output.  See Chapter 5 Section 5.5.1 for \nflare state definitions. \n \nThe relationship between the fluorescent X-ray intensity from a surface, which is incident on a collecting \narea, Iline (in photons \/ cm2 s), and the illuminating source intensity I0(E) can be derived from fundamental \nphysical parameters.

Accounting for and removing \nthe effect of gravitational compression allows the determination of an \u201cuncompressed density\u201d, which \nserves as a much better indicator of a planet\u2019s composition. Mercury\u2019s uncompressed density of 5.3 g cm-\n3 is large when compared with the other terrestrial planets (Strom and Sprague, 2003). Earth\u2019s \nuncompressed density for example is 4.0 g cm-3. Various models describing the formation and evolution \nof Mercury have been proposed, with different resultant compositions (Morgan and Anders, 1980; LPSI, \n1980; Fegley and Cameron, 1987; Goettel, 1988). The predicted surface compositions for nine of these \nmodels are given in ESA\u2019s BepiColombo Science requirements document and are shown in Table 3.1. \nComparison of measured and theoretical surface compositions can be used as an indication of the planet\u2019s \ntrue origins.

This scattered contribution to the detected signal for a given line must be removed \nto determine the line fluxes. Incoherent Compton scattering, in which energy is lost to electrons in the \nsurface, is negligible compared with coherent flux for X-ray energies below approximately 10 keV for \nlow Z elements (e.g. carbon) and 100 keV for high Z elements (e.g. gold) and can therefore be neglected \nin these calculations (Michette 1993).

Fluxes calculated from the surface of Mercury under B1, C1 and M1 flare conditions and \nassuming composition of the refractory rich model of formation. \n \nThe actual surface composition of Mercury remains a mystery. The Mariner 10 spacecraft carried no \ninstruments capable of measuring elemental abundances, mineral or rock types. All measurements of \nMercury\u2019s composition to date have been made from Earth by observing the solar spectrum reflected \nfrom Mercury in the infrared \u2013 ultraviolet waveband and by recalibrating Mariner 10 images of the \nsurface in narrow wavebands. Comparisons between these reflected spectra and measurements made in \nthe laboratory and at the Moon can provide an indication of surface composition. All of these \nmeasurements have led to the surprising conclusion that Mercury\u2019s surface is depleted of iron, even \nthough Mercury\u2019s large density and magnetic field imply that iron is a major constituent of the planet\u2019s \ncomposition (Strom and Sprague, 2003). This is primarily inferred by Mercury\u2019s high albedo compared to \nthe Moon, low radio reflectivity, and most importantly the reduced size, compared with other terrestrial \nplanets and the Moon, of an absorption feature between 900 and 1000 nm, caused by electron transition in \nthe Fe+ ion when iron is bound to oxygen in a silicon lattice. Only measurements of iron X-ray emission \nlines can determine categorically whether or not iron is present and in what abundance. \n \nThe dominant landforms on Mercury are impact craters produced by impacts by asteroids, comets and \nmeteoroids. These craters are often associated with large amounts of ejecta, which can be observed as \nrays extending out from the crater and impact melts often observed as a sheet on the crater floor. Craters \nprovide access to materials from depths of many metres and therefore provide a sample of the underlying \nregolith (Melosh, 1989). In addition, impact melts and ejecta contain elements from the original impactor, \nwhich can be used to yield information on the impactor\u2019s composition and origins. X-ray spectroscopy of \nimpactor residues in small craters found on retrieved spacecraft surfaces is a commonly used technique \nand is discussed on the nanometre scale in Chapter 6. \n \n 39\n 40\nThe role of volcanism in the evolution of Mercury\u2019s surface is another key area for investigation. Large \nsmooth plains have been observed by Mariner 10 on the surface, with a reduced density of impact \nfeatures. These surfaces must have been formed recently by comparison with intercrater plains, where \nsignificant cratering is observed. It has been deemed most likely that these smooth plains came about as a \nresult of volcanism (Murray et al., 1974) although no volcanic constructs have been identified. This may \nhowever be a result of the poor spatial resolution of the Mariner 10 images. The variation in albedo \nbetween these regions and the surrounding highlands is markedly reduced from that observed on the \nMoon. Knowledge of surface composition is essential if a volcanic origin is to be confirmed. \n \nThroughout its formation and evolution Mercury will have experienced very high temperatures given its \nclose proximity to the Sun. It is likely that there will be an overall depletion of elements with low boiling \ntemperatures, such as Na (boiling point at 1156K) and K (boiling point at 1032K). Elements with higher \nboiling temperatures, such as Al (2792K) and Ca (1757K) are likely to be more abundant (Lewis 1988).   \n \nMeasurements of fluorescent X-rays from the uppermost few microns of the surface can be combined \nwith complementary measurements by other instruments operating at different wavelengths. Gamma ray \nspectra provide compositional information extending to depths of approximately one metre (Reedy, 1978) \nwhile infrared and ultra violet spectra provide mineralogical information. A combination of spectroscopic \nmeasurements at different wavelengths has been employed extensively on the Moon (Heiken et al., 1991) \nand can allow differentiation of basaltic rocks, formed by volcanism, and other types of rocks in the \nsurrounding terrain.  \n \n \nCHAPTER 4 \n \n4 A Slumped MCP Collimator for Planetary Remote \nSensing \n \n4.1 Introduction \nAll of the instruments to have made measurements of X-ray fluorescence from planetary surfaces to date \nhave used detectors whose fields of view (FOV), and the resultant size of a surface element, were selected \nby a collimator. A schematic diagram of a typical collimated instrument is shown in Figure 4.1. An X-ray \ncollimator is normally an array of parallel channels whose aspect ratio (length L divided by diameter d) \ndefines the angular limit for which incident photons can be transmitted onto the underlying detector. \nCollimators are conventionally of a planar geometry and are placed directly in front of the detector. The \ndetector and collimator are necessarily identical in area and the angular resolution of the instrument is \nequal to the FOV (i.e. there is no true imaging capability). \n \nFigure 4.1. Schematic diagram of a planar collimator. The FWZM  field of view (\u03b8col) of the collimator is \ndefined by its aspect ratio (L\/D). \n \nThe first application of the technique for planetary remote sensing was on the Apollo 15 and 16 service \nmodules and since Apollo several planetary missions have employed X-ray spectrometers to determine \nsurface compositions. The X-ray and Gamma Ray Spectrometer (XRGS) on the Near Earth Asteroid \nRendezvous (NEAR-Shoemaker) spacecraft (Goldsten et. al., 1997 and Trombka et al., 2002), which \nvisited asteroid 433 Eros in 2001, and the X-ray Spectrometer (XRS) on the MESSENGER spacecraft \n(Starr et. al., 2001), launched on August 2nd 2005, en route to Mercury, with an expected insertion into \nHermetian orbit in March 2011, are essentially identical. The technology in both cases is similar to that of \nthe Apollo spectrometers (Adler et al., 1972a, b, c) in that all use collimated gas proportional counters \n(GPCs) as their X-ray detectors. A review of GPC detector operation is given by Fraser (1989). Both the \nNEAR-XRGS and the MESSENGER-XRS instruments have an intrinsic GPC energy resolution of ~ \n850eV FWHM at 5.9 keV (Starr et al., 2001) and, as was the case for Apollo before them, proper \nseparation of the K shell emission from Mg, Al and Si is not possible. Instead three separate detectors are \n 41\nemployed with 25\u00b5m Be windows, two of which bear additional thin Mg or Al filters. The Mg filter \nattenuates the Al line and to some extent the Si line, while the Al filter attenuates the Si line. In the bare \ndetector the Si line is most prominent. The resultant signal at each detector is the contribution from each \nof the three lines modified by the absorption properties of the filters. Three simultaneous equations are \ntherefore obtained, which can be solved to give the line intensities. The K lines of S, Ca, Ti and Fe are \nseparated sufficiently in energy that the GPCs can resolve them without this step (Clark and Trombka, \n1997a). A major disadvantage of this technique is the major loss of flux necessitated by absorption in the \nfilters. \n \nThe D-CIXS instrument on Smart-1 (Grande et al. 2001) and the instruments on the Japanese spacecraft \nHyabusa (Okada et al., 2000) and Selene (Okada et al., 2002) have utilised semiconductor detectors for \nthe first time. Semiconductors provide an intrinsic spectral resolution which is improved from that of the \ntraditional GPC approach so there is no need for filtering to resolve spectral lines; giving these \ninstruments access to greater X-ray fluxes. The improved spectral resolution arises because Fano factors \n(Fano, 1947; Alkhazov et al., 1967) in semiconductors are several times less than for gases. The Fano \nfactor F a is defined by  \nNFa=2\u03c3                 (4.1) \nwhere \u03c32 is the variance in the number of electrons N=E\/w produced in the initial localised charge cloud \ngenerated by a photon of energy E incident in a material with an average energy, w, required to create a \nsecondary ion pair. For a typical GPC gas (e.g. argon or xenon) Fa~0.17 and w~25 eV. For a typical \nsemiconductor (e.g. silicon or germanium) Fa<0.1 and w~3 eV (Fraser, 1989). X-ray photons in \nsemiconductor detectors therefore produce more charge carriers than in gas detectors and there are \nsmaller statistical fluctuations in the number of charge carriers produced.  \n \nThe mass and expense of the grazing incidence X-ray optics, used in X-ray astronomy and described in \nChapter 5, have inhibited their use on planetary missions but the development of low mass MCP optics \nwill lead to the introduction of imaging X-ray instruments for planetary missions in the future (Bavdaz et \nal., 2002; Price et al., 2001; Martin et al, 1999). In Chapter 5 MCP optics and their application to \nplanetary remote sensing on the BepiColombo mission to Mercury are described. Despite offering angular \nresolutions of approximately 1 arcminute, compared with collimator resolutions of several degrees, \npractical limits to optic sizes can result in a low X-ray throughput when compared to collimated \ninstruments. In addition, the X-ray reflectivity of grazing incidence optics falls off with energy, leading to \nreduced effective areas at higher energies. X-ray fluxes from planetary surfaces are typically very low and \nthe response of MCP optics to the emission lines of some key elements of interest for planetary science \n(e.g. Fe-K at 6.4 keV) is poor. Observations over a large spectral range are also required to allow the \ndetermination of absolute elemental abundances. High instrument throughput across a wide range of \nenergies is therefore important for planetary remote sensing and to this end collimated instruments, for \n 42\nwhich the transmission of X-ray flux on to a detector is independent of energy, will continue to be \nimportant for planetary missions. \n \nA traditional planar collimator geometry is not optimal for observing planetary surfaces. A geometry in \nwhich collimator and detector are separated, and for which there is a reduction in detector area relative to \nthe collimator area, will have a reduced minimum detectable flux, a reduced background, will place a \nreduced thermal load on cooling systems and will require less radiation shielding. These benefits are \ndescribed in more detail in sections 4.1.1 to 4.1.4. \n4.1.1 Minimum detectable flux \nThe sensitivity of a photon detecting instrument can be defined by the minimum signal flux from a source \nwhich it can distinguish from the background. This is referred to as the minimum detectable flux Fmin and \ncan be calculated for a collimator observing an extended source such as a planetary surface in terms of \nvarious instrument parameters.  \n \nAn isotropic flux F (in units of photons cm-2 s-1 sr1) of fluorescent X-rays at a discrete energy (in keV) \nfrom an extended source is incident on a collimator with an area Acol which has an underlying detector \nwith geometric area for photon detection Adet, energy resolution \u03b4E and Quantum Efficiency \u03be. All \nphotons transmitted through the collomator are subsequently incident on the detector. The collimator has \na FOV of \u2126 steradians and the transmission of the collimator as a function of angle is defined by the \nfunction T(\u03b8). The collimator will have a mean transmission T (between 0 and 1) over its FOV. The \ncollimator will also have an open area fraction T0, which results from the finite thickness of the collimator \nchannel walls (i.e. photons incident at 0\u00b0 cannot pass through this part of the collimator), which further \nreduces the total transmission. The detected X-ray signal is accompanied by a background X-ray flux, due \nto scattering from the surface under examination, which is denoted as Fscat (in units of photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1 \nkeV-1). The detector also has an intrinsic background Bi (units of counts cm-2 s-1 keV-1). The geometric \narea for the intrinsic background is Ai. We assume here for simplicity that Ai = Adet. If the instrument is \nallowed to integrate flux for a time t then the detected signal A is given by   \ntTTAFA col \u2126= 0\u03be .             (4.2) \nThe detected background B is given by \n)( 0det EtTTAFEtABB colscati \u03b4\u03be\u03b4 \u2126+= .                        (4.3) \nThe ratio of the signal to the standard deviation of the background is denoted as S and can be expressed as \ntTTAFtAB\nEtTTAFS\ncolscati\ncoll\n0det\n2\n1\n0 )(\n\u2126+\n\u2126=\n\u2212\n\u03be\n\u03b4\u03be\n            (4.4) \nand the minimum detectable flux Fmin for a given value of S (typically taken to be a factor of 3-5) is given \nby \n 43\ntTTA\nTTAFABES\nF\ncoll\ncolscati\n\u2126\n\u2126+=\n0\n0det\nmin\n)(\n\u03be\n\u03be\u03b4\n.            (4.5) \nA geometry in which the detector\u2019s area is reduced from that of the collimator results in a reduced value \nof Fmin and it is therefore an advantage when measuring low fluxes. The introduction of detectors with an \nimproved energy resolution \u03b4E will also lead to a reduced minimum detectable flux. \n4.1.2 Contribution of X-ray emission from the collimator to the instrument background \nCosmic radiation, X-rays from the planetary surface and incident charged particles will all strike the \ncollimator material and induce secondary X-ray and charged particle emission which will contribute to \nthe instrument background (Grande et al., 2003). This secondary emission will occur into 2\u03c0 steradians \nfrom a radiating point on the collimator, The fraction of emitted X-rays which are intercepted by a \ndetector of area Adet, separated from the collimator by a distance d, is proportional to the solid angle \nsubtended by the detector to the radiating point on the collimator, which is approximately Adet\/d2. This \ncontribution to the background is therefore reduced significantly by increasing d and reducing Adet, further \nimproving signal to background and reducing Fmin. \n4.1.3 Thermal \nSolid state X-ray detectors must be maintained at low temperatures to reduce their intrinsic noise; thus \nsome system for cooling is required. A reduced detector area places a smaller thermal load on any cooling \nsystem as there is a reduced volume of material to cool. In addition an increase in d and reduction in Adet \nreduces the thermal flux incident on the detector, as a result of thermal radiation from the collimator or \nthermal barrier films on the collimator face. As in Section 4.1.2 the detector\u2019s radiative coupling with \nthese surfaces will be dependent on the solid angle subtended by the detector at a point on the radiating \nsurface and is therefore proportional to Adet\/d2. Although this radiative heat transfer dominates the heating \nof a detector there is an additional heating which is intrinsic to the device as a result of potentials applied \nfor charge transfer. This contribution to heating is small compared with radiative coupling but scales \napproximately linearly with detector area. \n4.1.4 Radiation Shielding \nA major problem for semiconductor detectors, which are usually silicon, is their susceptibility to damage \nby radiation. The D-CIXS Si swept charge device, was believed to have a reduced susceptibility to \nradiation damage compared with standard CCD devices, operates near room temperature (Grande et al., \n2003), and has an energy resolution given as ~200 eV between 0.5 keV and 10 keV (Grande et al., 2001). \nIt has since been shown by Holland et al. (2004) that the claims of radiation hardness are unfounded and \nprepublication spectra, measured by D-CIXS at the Moon, indicate a severe reduction in spectral \nresolution following radiation damage sustained during a prolonged passage through the Van Allen \nradiation belts en route to the Moon. A smaller detector located deeper within the spacecraft requires \nreduced radiation shielding with resultant reduction in instrument mass. \n \n 44\nSolid state detectors have introduced an improvement factor of approximately 4 in the spectral resolution \navailable to X-ray astronomers (Fraser, 1989); however, their introduction to orbital planetary X-ray \ninstrumentation has been slow, due in part to the limitations of standard collimator geometries as outlined \nabove. This chapter introduces a novel slumped collimator geometry which allows the separation of \ncollimator and detector and reduces the area requirement of the detector as a fraction of collimator area \nwith a minimal loss of throughput, allowing the practical application of semiconductor detectors to \ncollimated X-ray instruments on planetary science missions for the first time. \n4.2 Flat collimators \nFor a diffuse source, such as the fluorescent X-ray flux from a planetary surface, the key parameter in \ndetermining sensitivity is the grasp (G) (units of cm2 sr), which quantifies the instrument throughput and \nis given by the product of the collimators FOV, \u2126, in steradians and the mean effective area over the FOV \neffA , given by \n0TTAA coleff = ,                      (4.6) \nwhere Acol is the geometric area of the collimator, T is the mean transmission of the collimator over the \nfield of view and T0 is the collimator\u2019s open area fraction.  \n4.2.1 Collimator grasp \nThe one dimensional transmission function of a parallel channel collimator is  \n( )\ncol\nT \u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8 \u2212= 1 ,                                      (4.7) \nfor \u03b8 < \u03b8col otherwise T=0, where \u03b8col is the maximum angle relative to the channel axis at which a ray \ncan be transmitted (shown in Figure 4.1). \u03b8 is the angle of incidence of a given X-ray relative to the \nchannel axes. The triangular transmission function, for a collimator with a FOV of 12\u00b0 (\u03b8col = 6\u00b0) is \nshown in Figure 4.2. The collimator\u2019s grasp G is given by the integration of Equation 4.7 between the \nlimits of \u00b1\u03b8col and multiplied by the on axis effective area, \n\u222b\n\u2212\n\u2212=\ncol\ncol\ndATG\ncol\ncol\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\n10                                                (4.8) \ncolcolATG \u03b80= .

Transmission function of a 1D flat collimator with a 12\u00b0 FOV (\u03b8col = 6\u00b0). \n \nThis transmission function can be extended to describe a three dimensional collimator system by \nintroducing a component in \u03c6, orthogonal to \u03b8, to give a transmission function \n( ) \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\ncolcol\nT \u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8 11 ,                                              (4.10) \nThe effective area of the collimator as a function of angle is given by the transmission function multiplied \nby geometric area and open area fraction. Figure 4.3 shows the effective area as a function of angle for a \ncollimator with a format like that shared by two of the three D-CIXS collimator facets with \u03b8col = 6\u00b0 \n(0.105 rad), open area fraction T0 = 0.64 and geometric area Acol = 8 cm2 (McBride and Castiglione, \n2001). The remaining D-CIXS facet has \u03b8col = 4\u00b0 but is otherwise identical. The effective area peaks on \naxis with a value T0Acol=5.6 cm2. Integrating this transmission function between the angular limits \u00b1\u03b8col \nand \u00b1\u03c6col and multiplying by T0 and Acol produces the three dimensional grasp of a planar collimator: \ncolcolcolATG \u03c6\u03b80= .

Effective area of a 2D planar collimator in the format of a single D-CIXS collimator facet as \na function of angle of incident X-ray. \n4.2.2 Detector Plane \nIn a conventional planar collimated instrument the detector is located directly behind the collimator and \nhas the same area (Adet=Acol). As described in Section 4.1 there are advantages to be gained by separating \nthe collimator and detector elements by some distance d. If  the collimator\u2019s side length lcol remains \nconstant then to intercept all transmitted X-rays the instrument would require a detector with sides of \nlength (ldet) given by \ncolcol dll \u03b8tan2det += ,                                              (4.12) \nresulting in a detector area,  \ncolcolcolcol dldAA \u03b8\u03b8 tan4tan4 22det ++= .                                (4.13)\nThe imaging X-ray telescope for the Mercury imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) intended for the \nBepiColombo mission to Mercury, described in Chapter 5, will have an additional collimated channel to \nprovide a high throughput of X-rays. A geometry proposed for this channel used a collimating hole in the \ncentre of the X-ray optic as shown in Figure 4.4. X-rays are transmitted onto an extended detector in the \ntelescope focal plane. The distance d is equal to the telescope focal length which will can be assumed to \nbe equal to the side length of the spacecraft bus, which was originally given as 0.7 m (See Chapter 5 for a \ndetailed description of MIXS, instrument focal length and the BepiColombo mission to Mercury). For a \ndetector-collimator separation distance of 0.7 m a planar collimator geometry would require a detector \nwith an area of 516 cm2, to match the collimator footprint in the detector plane. Such a detector size \nwould have excessive data processing requirements, have a high value of Fmin, would prove challenging \nto cool and be expensive to fabricate. Any attempt to separate a collimator and detector, in a planar \n 47\ngeometry will result in large values of Adet with resultant disadvantages for the instrument. Such solutions \nare therefore impractical. An improved geometry will allow separation of the collimator and detector, \nwhile minimising the detector area. If the detector area can be reduced to less than the area of the \ncollimator then this would have an advantage over conventional collimated instruments for the reasons \noutlined in Section 4.1. \n \nFigure 4.4. A possible collimator geometry for the Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer in which an \nMCP optic is complimented by a collimator at its centre. \n4.3 A Slumped Collimator \nFigure 4.5 illustrates the geometry of a collimator which has now been shaped such that it forms a section \nof a sphere with radius R. All of the channel axes are orientated toward the centre of curvature. From this \npoint on this is referred to as a \u201cslumped\u201d collimator geometry. The slumped collimator has a side length \n2lmax and the angle lmax\/R is denoted as \u03b8max. The position of an individual channel on the collimator can be \ndenoted by either a length \u00b1lchan from the collimator\u2019s centre or an angle \u00b1\u03b8chan from the collimator axis. \nThe aspect ratio of the collimator defines the acceptance angle of a single channel \u03b8col = arctan(D\/L) \n(Figure 4.2). The angle of incidence of an X-ray is denoted as \u00b1\u03b8. A detector at an axial distance R\/2 from \nthe collimator has a side length lmax. In this configuration every channel axis, when extended to the \ndetector plane, is intercepted by the detector and the fraction of the transmitted flux from a single channel \narriving at the collimator is always > 0.5. The fraction from a channel on the collimator axis equals 1. \n 48\n \nFigure 4.5. Geometry of a slumped collimator with slump radius R, and collimator angle \u03b8col. \n4.3.1 1D collimator grasp \nThe transmission function of a single channel at angular position \u03b8chan on a slumped collimator in 1D \nshown in Figure 4.5 is given by  \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212=\ncol\nchanT \u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 1)( \u2019                                  (4.14) \nfor \u03b8 < \u03b8col, otherwise T=0. The transmission function for a collimator with \u03b8col = \u03b8max = 6\u00b0 is shown in \nFigure 4.6. The collimator\u2019s grasp can be expressed in terms of the mean transmission T  over the \ncollimator\u2019s FOV as \n )(2 max0 colcolATTG \u03b8\u03b8 += .                                              (4.15) \nwhere \u00b1\u03b8max denotes the positions of the microchannels at the collimator\u2019s extremities and 2(\u03b8max+\u03b8col) is \nthe Full Width Zero Maximum (FWZM) FOV of the collimator. The transmission function Tchan(\u03b8) of a \nsingle channel is equivalent to that of a flat collimator (Equation 4.9) and the mean transmission \nchanT relative to an individual channel\u2019s axis between -\u03b8col and \u03b8col is therefore 0.5. The FOV of a single \nchannel as a fraction Fchan of the total FOV of the collimator is \nmax\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\n+= col\ncol\nchanF ,                                    (4.16) \nA geometry is adopted here in which \u03b8max = \u03b8col resulting in a value of 0.5 for Fchan. The mean \ntransmission T of the entire collimator is the product of the mean transmission of a single channel and \nthe FOV of that channel as a fraction Fchan of the total collimator FOV, which here gives a value of \nT equal to 0.25. \n 49\n \nFigure 4.6. 1D Transmission of a slumped collimator where \u03b8col = \u03b8max = 6\u00b0. \n \nFigure 4.6 shows a slumped collimator transmission curve with a FWZM at \u00b112\u00b0 and Full Width Half \nMaximum (FWHM) at \u00b16\u00b0. The effective area (Aeff) at a given angle is the product of the geometrical \narea, the open area fraction and the transmission. The mean effective area multiplied by the FOV gives \nthe grasp. If the FOV is taken over the FWHM shown in Figure 4.6 between -6\u00b0< \u03b8ray<6\u00b0 (the FOV of a \nflat collimator with an identical L\/D) then the 1D grasp G is found to be 0.554 cm rads. Over the FWZM \nFOV (-12\u00b0 < \u03b8ray< 12\u00b0) the total grasp G equals 0.664 cm rad. The FWZM FOV can be restricted and \nmore closely approximate that of a flat collimator by increasing the aspect ratio L\/D. The transmission \nfunction of a slumped collimator as above, but with L\/D=20 is shown in Figure 4.7. \n \nWith L\/D=20 the FWZM viewing angle is restricted to \u00b18.6\u00b0 but with the adverse result that there is an \noverall reduction in effective area at all angles and a subsequent loss of grasp. This reduction in \ntransmission can be minimised by limiting the FOV with a profiled collimator geometry which is \ndiscussed in Section 4.5. \n \n 50\n \nFigure 4.7. 1D grasp for a slumped collimator where lmax=8 cm, R=40 cm and L\/D=20 \n \n4.3.2 2D Grasp \nExtending the transmission function into two dimensions the transmission in \u03c6, the angular direction \northogonal to \u03b8, is introduced,  \n \u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212=\ncol\nchan\ncol\nchanT \u03c6\n\u03c6\u03c6\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03c6\u03b8 11),( ,                                     (4.17) \nand the grasp is given by \n))((),(4 maxmax0 colcolcolATTG \u03c6\u03c6\u03b8\u03b8\u03c6\u03b8 ++= .

(4.19) \nThe calculated mean transmission for the given geometry is 0.0625. The effective area (Aeff) as a function \nof \u03b8ray and \u03c6 ray is shown in Figure 4.8, where the collimator\u2019s geometric area A = 64 cm2, lmax = \u00b14 cm,  R \n= 40 cm, open area fraction T0 = 0.7 and L\/D = 10. These values are chosen to coincide with a previously \nsuggested geometry for a Mercury orbiting instrument based on the D-CIXS concept. Again the mean off-\naxis effective area across a selected FOV, multiplied by that solid angular FOV gives the collimator grasp \nfor a given angular range.  \n \nThe grasp values over angular ranges for which formulae are not presented here have been calculated by a \ncomputational method in which T(\u03b8,\u03c6) is calculated at points across the collimator face for values of \u03b8 \nand \u03c6 within a defined angular range. These values are then averaged to provide a value of T which is \nthen applied to the given expressions for G to provide grasp values within these ranges. This \n 51\ncomputational method also allows the introduction of variations in aspect ratio across the collimator face \nor \u201cprofiling\u201d, which is described in Section 4.4. Grasp values calculated by raytracing X-rays through \nthis collimator geometry using a modified version of the Monte Carlo code described in Chapter 5 are \nshown in Table 4.2 and compared to the values obtained from this geometrical model.  \n \nOver the FWHM FOV (-0.1< \u03b8ray <0.1 rad and -0.1< \u03c6ray <0.1 rad) the grasp G calculated from the \ngeometrical model equals 0.309 cm2 sr, and over the FWZM FOV (-0.2< \u03b8ray<0.2 and -0.2< \u03c6ray <0.2) G \nequals 0.444 cm2 sr. The grasp of a planar collimator with equivalent collimator area, open area fraction \nand aspect ratio is 0.448 cm2 sr. A slumped geometry therefore results in a minimal reduction in \ncollimator throughput compared with a planar collimator of equivalent dimensions.  \n \nFigure 4.8. 2D effective area vs angle for a slumped collimator where lmax= 8cm, R=40 cm and L\/D=10. \n4.3.3 Detector Plane \nSection 4.1 demonstrates that it is advantageous for a collimator to use as small a detector as possible. A \ndetector at axial position R\/2 in the geometry outlined above will require a side length equal to that of the \ncollimator to acquire all transmitted rays despite the collimator-detector separation. This in itself is an \nadvantage over conventional collimated instruments. The slumped geometry has the added advantage of \nallowing a significant reduction in detector size with little loss of signal.  \n \nIf a detector is placed at axial coordinate R\/2 and has a side length equal to half that of the collimator, \nthen every collimator channel axis will be intersected by the detector, providing \u03b8max = \u03b8col as indicated in \nthe previous sections. Some rays will however miss the detector, reducing the instrument\u2019s grasp and \nresulting in a loss of signal. If \u03b8chan is a channel\u2019s angular position and \u03b8 is now measured from the \nchannel axis, and not the collimator axis, then for a channel with angular position \u03b8chan>0 X-rays with an \n 52\nincident angle \u03b8 > 0 will miss the detector, after passing through the collimator, if \u03b8 < \u03b8chan - \u03b8col and \u03b8col > \n0. If \u03b8chan< 0 then transmitted X-rays will miss the detector after passing through the collimator if \u03b8 > \u03b8chan \n+ \u03b8col;. The transmission function of a single channel is equivalent to that of a flat collimator. The shaded \nregion in Figure 4.9 represents X-rays transmitted by a single 1D channel at \u03b8chan, which do not hit the \ndetector for the \u03b8chan < 0 case. The fraction of rays incident on a given channel, which are transmitted but \nare not incident on the detector can be determined by calculating the ratio of the shaded region of the \ntransmission function, and the integrated transmission function over all angles.  \n \n \nFigure 4.9. Transmission function of a single channel with angular position \u03b8chan, relative to the central \naxis of the collimator for the case where\u03b8chan<0 . The incident X-ray angle\u03b8 is measured relative to a line \nparallel to the axis of the given channel. The shaded area indicates transmitted rays, which are not \nincident on the detector following transmission. \n \nFor a single channel at position \u03b8 the triangular shaded area An in Figure 4.9 is the product \u03b8chanT(\u03b8)\/2. \nSubstituting Equation 4.7 we obtain the expression for An \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212=\ncol\nchan\nnA \u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8 1\n2\n,                                         (4.20) \nwhere \u03b8=(\u03b8col-\u03b8chan) giving \ncol\nchan\nnA \u03b8\n\u03b8\n2\n2\n= .

(4.23) \nBecause of the symmetry of the collimator the fraction Fhit of photons hitting the detector after \ntransmission through all of the collimator channels can be determined by integrating F1\/\u03b8col over half of \nthe collimator, \n2\n2\nmax\n0\n0\n2\n2 6\n1\n2\n1\nmax\nmax\ncol\nchancol\nchan\ncol\nchan\nd\nd\nF \u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u2212=\u2212=\n\u222b\n\u222b\n,                                             (4.24)\nwhere \u03b8max = \u03b8col and Fhit is therefore equal to 5\/6. The fraction F2 for both hemispheres must be identical \ndue to the collimator symmetry and so this value represents F2 for the entire 1D collimator. This can be \nextended into 2D to include a \u03c6 component, and so represent a real collimator, by squaring the solution, \nagain due to the collimator\u2019s symmetry. The resultant value for the total fraction of rays passing through \nthe collimator which are then subsequently incident on the detector Fhit is 25\/36 or ~0.7. Raytracing of \nthis geometry with a modified version of the model described in Chapter 5 also produces a fraction Fhit of \n0.7.

A linearly profiled collimator for which the channel aspect ratio changes with constant \ngradient from the collimator centre towards its extremities. \n \nTo profile a collimator is to vary the aspect ratio L:D and therefore the angle \u03b8col, as a function of a \nchannel position (\u03b8chan,\u03c6chan). By doing this it is possible to increase Fhit and restrict the viewing angle \nwhilst minimising the loss of grasp which results from a universal increase in L:D. Optimisation of the \nprofiling function is essential to ensure a minimal loss of detectable flux. A linearly profiled collimator, \n 54\n 55\nfor which channel diameter varies with a constant gradient from the collimator\u2019s centre to its extremity, is \nshown in Figure 4.10. G for a collimator with this geometry is calculated to be a factor of 0.37 that of a \nnon-profiled collimator by the computational method indicated in Section 4.3.2 with the addition that the \nangle \u03b8col is recalculated for each position on the collimator to provide the profile.  \n \nTable 4.2 compares the grasps of a flat collimator of the D-CIXS format, a non-profiled slumped \ncollimator and slumped collimators with different profiling functions. In each case it is assumed that the \nchannel diameter remains constant while the channel length is altered in the manner specified by the \nfunction shown in the table. L\/D is varied from 10 at the centre of the collimator to 20 at its edge. For \nslumped collimators \u03b8max = \u03b8col on the collimator axis. A slumped collimator has a grasp comparable with \nthat of a flat collimator with the same dimensions but allows the use of a detector with half the side \nlength. Profiling results in a significant reduction in grasp but restricts the FOV. \nProfiling \nfunction \ntype \nFWZM \n(radians) \nGrasp \nover full \nview \n(cm2 sr) \nRay \ntraced \ngrasp \nover full \nview \n(cm2 sr) \nGrasp \nover \u00b10.1 \nradians \n(cm2 sr) \nRay \ntraced \ngrasp \nover \u00b10.1 \n(cm2 sr) \nFWHM \n(radians) \nFlat \ncollimator \n(D-CIXS \nformat, all \nfacets) \n0.1 0.101 0.097 0.101 0.097 0.05 \nFlat \ncollimator  \n2lmax =  8 cm\n0.1 0.448 0.411 0.448 0.411 0.05 \nSlumped \nnon \nprofiled \n2lmax = 8 cm \n0.2 0.444 0.425 0.309 0.297 0.1 \nSlumped \nLinear \nprofiled \n2lmax =  8 cm\n0.15 0.164  \n- \n0.140  \n- \n0.09 \nSlumped \nSquare \nprofiled  \n2lmax =  8 cm\n0.15 0.277  \n- \n0.226  \n- \n0.1 \nSlumped \nSin profiled \n2lmax =  8 cm\n0.15 0.182 - 0.158 - 0.1 \nSlumped \nTan \nprofiled \nlmax =  4 cm \n0.15 0.234  \n- \n0.194  \n- \n0.1 \nTable 4.2.

In Table 4.2 various profile types are compared and shown to introduce different reductions in \ninstrument grasp. It is important therefore to identify an optimum profile type that minimises this loss of \ngrasp.  \n \nFor the same L\/D a slumped collimator has a larger FOV than a flat collimator, although the contribution \nfrom rays at angles greater than \u03b8col to the overall signal is small. The maximum obtainable grasp of a \nslumped collimator will occur in the non-profiled case. The ideal profile will be one for which the aspect \nratio approximates that of the non-profiled case towards the centre of the collimator, before rapidly \nincreasing towards the extremities to limit the acceptance angle of these channels. Such a profile can be \ndescribed by a power law of the form  \n1\nmax\n12 )(' LLLL\nn\nchan +\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212= \u03b8\n\u03b8\n                                  (4.25) \nWhere L1 is the channel length on the collimator axis, L2 is the channel length at the collimator\u2019s edge, \n\u03b8max is the position of the collimator\u2019s edge, \u03b8chan is the position of given channel and n is the power \nlaw index. \n \nThe advantage of a power law over some other types of function is demonstrated initially by the success \nof the square profiling function (n=2) when compared to the other profiling forms in Table 4.2. With each \nincreasing power the area approximating a non-profiled collimator will become larger; the increase in \naspect ratio towards the extremities will become more rapid and will occur closer to the collimator\u2019s edge. \nWith each increase in power there will also be an increase in grasp whilst the collimator acceptance angle \nwill remain unchanged (providing the maximum aspect ratio remains the same in all cases). Beyond some \npower the acceptance angle will begin to rise as the aspect ratio rise occurs close enough to the \ncollimator\u2019s edge that the acceptance angles of channels close to the edge can exceed that required. \n \nSimulating profiles for n=1-5 it was found that grasp did indeed increase with power law index. The \nrange of aspect ratios used in this case was 10:1 to 20:1. For n = 2, 3 and 4 profiles the detector side \nlength ldet required for Fhit = 1 is 6 cm; for n=5 ldet = 6.2 cm. For n>4 it was found that the FWZM FOV of \nthe collimator began to increase. The transmission of the n=4 and n=5 cases was simulated using the \ngeometrical model and the resultant plots in 1D are shown in Figures 4.11 and 4.12.

Acceptance angles can be limited further \nby increasing the maximum aspect ratio to 50:1. This has little effect on grasp as the large aspect ratio \nonly affects a small region on the collimator. 1D transmission functions for an n=4 profiled collimator \nwith maximum aspect ratio of 50:1 can be seen in Figure 4.13. The effective area in the 2D case is shown \nin Figure 4.14. In this case acceptance angle is reduced to 7.4\u00b0 whist the FWHM becomes 5.67\u00b0 and grasp \nis reduced to 0.20 cm2 sr over 6\u00b0 and 0.225 cm2 sr over the full view.

Transmission of a 1D n=5  profiled slumped collimator with L\/D from 10:1to 20:1. \n The viewing angle of the collimator can be limited further by reducing D for the square channel\u2019s \ndiameter, thus increasing the aspect ratio of every channel; this, however, results in an appreciable loss in \ngrasp. A universal reduction in aspect ratio will result in an increase in grasp but also increases the \nacceptance angle. \n \nFigure 4.13.

Collimators on the European EXOSAT X-ray observatory, however, were \nproduced from lead glass by the same drawing and fusion manufacturing process as MCPs (Fraser, \n1989). EXOSAT was operated in a highly eccentric, near polar orbit between May 1983 and May 1986. \nIn a laboratory setting MCPs have been demonstrated as collimators for X-rays of energies less than 8 \nkeV (Yamaguchi et al., 1987) and terrestrial instrumentation utilising the collimating properties of MCPs \nhave been proposed (Skala, 2000). Kent et al. (2000) have suggested that on planetary missions low Z \nelements such as oxygen and silicon, which are the prime constituents of MCP glass (see Chapter 2), will \ninteract with high energy cosmic rays resulting in X-ray fluorescence, indistinguishable from the source \nunder observation, which will essentially blind the detector. For this reason the collimator on D-CIXS \n(Grande et al., 2003; Kent et al., 2000), whose dimensions and geometry are comparable with those of an \nMCP (D=168 \u00b5m, L=1.8 and 2.4 mm) and which has FWZM half angles of 6\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, was manufactured \nfrom gold plated copper in a square channel microarray structure (McBride and Castiglione, 2001). This \nhigh Z coating material was used in order to avoid any contamination of the detected signal. It may be, \nhowever, that interactions of cosmic rays with the Gold coating may cause Au-M line fluorescence at \n2.12 keV, which will contaminate the detected signal. Experience on EXOSAT, where MCP type \ncollimators (Hoffman, 1975) operated successfully in deep space, would suggest that concerns over signal \ncontamination by fluorescence from the MCPs may be unfounded. \n \nFor the slumped collimator geometry, MCPs have a distinct advantage over other collimator materials \nbecause they already have a heritage as slumped optics (Price, 2001) and in particular as \u201cLobster\u2019s eye\u201d \nX-ray optics introduced in Chapter 1 (Angel, 1979), whose geometry is similar to that of the slumped \n 59\n 60\ncollimator geometry introduced here. The output from an MCP collimated instrument will therefore \ncontain two components. The first will be an energy independent diffuse background consisting entirely \nof collimated X-rays. The second component will be focussed after grazing incidence reflection from \northogonal channel walls. The geometry described here is optimised for collimation, though the focussed \ncomponent may be used to increase the grasp of the collimator for low energy rays and low grazing \nincidence angles. Complications are introduced however as this component will have its own energy and \nangle dependent response. Contributions from both collimated and focussed components must be \nidentified and separated in order to determine abundance ratios and ultimately absolute abundances. If \nrequired the focussed component can be removed by increasing the surface roughness of the \nmicrochannel walls by an etching process as was the case for EXOSAT, where the MCP collimators were \nbathed in hydrogen fluoride to reduce the inherent reflectivity of the MCP channel walls (Abbey, 2005). \n4.6 Conclusions \nX-ray measurements of planetary surfaces have conventionally been made by instruments with an X-ray \ndetector whose field of view is limited by a collimator with a planar geometry and triangular transmission \nfunction. Although the majority of these instruments, from Apollo to the present day, have used gas \nproportional counter detectors a new generation of instruments from Europe and Japan are employing \nsolid state detectors for the first time. The planar collimator geometry however has remained the same in \nall cases but is not optimal for measurements of extended sources.  \n \nA slumped collimator geometry provides a grasp which is comparable with that of a planar geometry but \nallows the separation of collimator and detector and a reduction in the detector area\/collimator area \nrequired by a factor of 4. This separation and size reduction reduces an instrument\u2019s minimum detectable \nflux and has specific advantages for solid state detectors in terms of detector heating, radiation exposure \nand the cost of detector fabrication.  \n \nThe slumped geometry has an increased full width zero maximum field of view compared with a planar \ncollimator and will therefore have a reduced surface resolution if the field of view is defined by the full \nwidth zero maximum. The full width half maximum field of view of the slumped collimator is equal to \nthe full width zero maximum of a planar collimator and can be used to define the field of view as the \ncontribution at larger angles is small. If required the field of view of a slumped collimator can be limited \nby profiling to alter the aspect ratio as a function of position on the collimator face.  \n \nOwing to their heritage as X-ray collimators on EXOSAT and their development as slumped X-ray optics \nwith similar geometries to that described here, square channel MCPs are ideal as collimators for an \ninstrument with a slumped collimator geometry. The intrinsic X-ray reflectivity of the channel surfaces, \nunless reduced through etching, leads to a focussed component, with advantages in terms of soft X-ray \nflux but which will cause difficulties for elemental abundance determination. A future study to quantify \nthe relative magnitudes of these two components, as a function of angle and energy, and the ease of \n 61\nseparation of these two components for composition calculations may be required for future instrument \noptimisation. Here it has been assumed that detected fluxes contain no reflected component (i.e. the \nmicrochannels have a high surface roughness).   \n \nThe slumped collimator geometry is a new instrument design for the remote sensing of X-rays from \nplanetary surfaces from orbit. It has a particular application to extreme radiation and thermal \nenvironments and has been adopted as a high throughput channel for the Mercury Imaging X-ray \nSpectrometer (MIXS) on the BepiColombo mission to Mercury, which is described in detail in Chapter 5. \n CHAPTER 5 \n \n5 The Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer \n \n5.1 Introduction \nThe Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) is a key instrument in the science payload of \nBepiColombo\u2019s Mercury Polar Orbiter (MPO), one of two space craft which make up the BepiColombo \nmission; the other being the Japanese Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO). The MIXS instrument \nhas two channels: MIXS-C is a high throughput collimated channel based on the geometry described in \nChapter 4, and MIXS-T is an imaging X-ray telescope providing 2 arcminute angular resolution using \nMCP Wolter optics. The two MIXS channels are shown together in Figure 5.1. MIXS-T is derived from \nthe earlier HERMES imaging spectrometer proposal to ESA (Owens et al., 2001). In this Chapter the \noptimisation of both MIXS channels is described and the overall performance of the MIXS instrument at \nMercury is predicted. The global composition maps produced by MIXS will have a spatial and spectral \nresolution superior to that achieved by any orbital X-ray spectrometer on any previous planetary mission.  \n \n \nFigure 5.1. Schematic overview of MIXS showing both the imaging and collimating channels (from the \nMIXS Science and Technology Plan., 2004). \nAll previously flown instruments for X-ray fluorescence observations from orbit rely on collimators to \nrestrict their FOVs and have no imaging capability as the collimator\u2019s acceptance angle defines the \nangular resolution. Maps of a surface are produced by the combination of separate spectral measurements, \nwhich are later combined. The D-CIXS instrument on SMART-1 has three collimator facets, one with an \n8\u00b0 FOV and two with 12\u00b0 FOVs (Grande et al., 2001). Such fields are typical for collimated X-ray \nspectrometers of this type and result in large surface footprints, placing severe limits on the spatial \nresolution of elemental composition maps. The XRS on NASA\u2019s MESSENGER mission to Mercury uses \n 62\n 63\na 12\u00ba Be-Cu honeycomb collimator which, when coupled with the highly elliptical MESSENGER orbit, \nresults in a surface footprint of approximately 3000km at apoherm (15193 km) (Starr et al., 2001). At this \nspatial resolution the entire planet essentially subtends one image pixel. At periherm (200km) the \nfootprint is reduced to 40km but this resolution is only available for 15 minutes in each 12 hour orbit. A \ncharacteristic crater size in the Hermetian highlands is 120 km (Strom and Sprague, 2003), so the \nMESSENGER XRS will therefore only resolve inter-crater features on this scale for a small fraction of its \norbit. To resolve structure and inter-crater compositional variations X-ray spectra with a surface \nresolution of less than 120km are required throughout the orbit. A resolution of less than 1km will \napproach that of instrumentation imaging at complementary wavelengths such as the optical and the \ninfrared for which surface resolutions of between 50 and 500 m are required (ESA Science requirements \ndocument for BepiColombo, 2004). MIXS-T will have an unprecedented surface resolution of 200 m at \nperiherm.  \nThe collimated gas proportional counters (GPCs) of the Apollo 15 and 16 era produced Al\/Si and Mg\/Si \nabundance ratios for equatorial regions of the Moon (Adler et al., 1972), which were used to identify \nhighland and maria rock types. One benefit of the ratioing process was believed to be the removal of any \nsignal changes resulting from physical variations in the regolith such as surface roughness (Clark and \nTrombka, 1997a) but it was also a necessity as an insufficient range of elemental line energies were \nobservable with these instruments to allow the determination of absolute abundances. The dependence of \nthe intensity variation of emission lines of different energies owing to irregularities in the surface \ngeometry was deemed to be weak by the team developing the instrument and ratioing was expected to \nremove geometric influences on the signal (Adler et al., 1972a,b,c, Starr et al., 2000). Okada et al. (2002 \nand 2004) present results which suggest that for observation angles other than normal incidence the \ndetected intensity of fluorescent X-rays from a surface with micron scale surface roughness, comparable \nwith a planetary or asteroidal surface, will vary with energy. The energy dependence makes this ratioing \nprocess alone unreliable as a means of determining rock types at large observation and illumination \nangles. Okada et al. (2004) concludes that this effect is sufficient to change the meteoritic analogue of \nasteroid 433 Eros (meteorite type to which 433 Eros can be likened) as determined from Mg\/Si and Ca\/Si \nratios measured by the collimated GPC X-ray spectrometers on NEAR-Shoemaker (Trombka et al., \n2002). For nadir observations of large objects such as Mercury, the observation angle across the FOV ~ 0 \nand so roughness is unlikely to significantly affect the energy distribution of the outgoing flux. The \nincident angle of incoming solar X-rays will vary across a hemisphere, however, with a resultant variation \nin the fluorescent flux observed from orbit.  \n \n5.2 MCP Wolter optics for MIXS-T \n5.2.1 Wolter optical geometries \n \nFigure 5.2. Focussing geometry of a Wolter type I grazing incidence optical system. \n \nFor any optical system to form an image it must satisfy the Abbe sine condition, that for each ray of a \nparallel beam from a source at infinity  \nFh =\u03b8sin\/ ,                (5.1) \nwhere h is radial distance from the optical axis, \u03b8 is the angle subtended by the ray\u2019s final path relative to \nits incident path and the focal length F is a constant for all rays. Wolter (1952a,b) showed that successive \ngrazing incidence reflections from a paraboloid and then a confocal and coaxial hyperboloid, shown in \nFigure 5.2, will approximately satisfy the Abbe sine condition. \n \nWolter proposed three possible reflection modes for grazing incidence focussing using this optical \ngeometry. In Type I images are formed after single consecutive internal face reflections at the paraboloid \nand then the hyperboloid. Type II focuses by means of an internal face reflection at the paraboloid \nfollowed by an external face reflection at the hyperboloid. Type III uses an external face reflection \nfollowed by an internal face reflection. \n \nMathematical treatments of the Wolter type I geometry are given by Mangus and Underwood (1969) and \nVanSpeybroek and Chase (1972) and Michette (1993). If an incoming X-ray strikes the paraboloid at \nP1(x1, y1, z1) and the hyperboloid at P2(x2, y2, z2) then, in the x=0 (y,z) plane shown in Figure 5.2, the \nmirror surfaces are generated by the equations,  \n( ) )2( pzpzy p += ,                           (5.2) \n 64\nfor the paraboloid where the factor p is defined as \n111 zPFp \u2212=                (5.3) \nand  \n( ) ( ) 22\n22\nb\na\nezbzyh \u2212\u2212=                    (5.4) \nfor the hyperboloid where \n)(\n2\n1\n2221 PFPFa \u2212=                            (5.5) \nand the eccentricity e is given by \n222 bae += .                           (5.6) \n \nThe path of a ray through a Wolter type I imaging system is illustrated in Figure 5.2. By considering the \nincident and reflected angles of rays at each of the two mirrors an expression for the focal length of the \ntelescope F=F2 in terms of the lens radius R0, measured from the intersection of the two mirrors to the \noptical axis, and the total angular change in ray direction, \u03b12, or the incidence angle of the ray, \u03b11, can be \nderived; provided that at the mirror boundary the incident angles on both the hyperbola and the parabola \nare equal (VanSpeybroek and Chase, 1972). The Focal length F is given by the expression \n*\n1\n0\n*\n2\n0\n4tantan \u03b1\u03b1\nRRF == ,                           (5.7) \nwhere * denotes reflections at the paraboloid-hyperboloid boundary. If this mirror boundary condition is \nmet then the collecting area and short wavelength X-ray reflectivity are maximised for a given diameter \nto focal length ratio, with little loss of angular resolution. In addition it can also be shown that at the \ninterface between the two mirrors the angle subtended by the tangent to the parabola and the optical axis \n(\u03b8*p) and the tangent to the hyperbola and the optical axis (\u03b8*h) are related by, \n** 3 ph \u03b8\u03b8 = (VanSpeybroek and Chase, 1972).                        (5.8) \n5.2.2 MCP conic approximations to Wolter geometry \nA conic approximation to the Wolter geometry employs two cones, whose angles satisfy the conditions \nrequired for Equation 5.7 to be valid and for which Equation 5.8 must therefore apply at the interface \nbetween the two cones. If the conic section is provided by an MCP microchannel then the lengths Lparab \nand Lhyperb are small and deviation from an ideal conic section will also be small. Price (2001) gives a \ndetailed description of the microchannel conic approximation to Wolter imaging systems, which is \nsummarised here.  \n \nIn an MCP Wolter optic the two consecutive MCPs are slumped such that their faces form sections of \nspheres with radii R1 and R2 to provide the necessary conic sections. From Equation 5.18 the relationship \nbetween the two slump radii is  \n21 3RR =                             (5.9) \n 65\n By analysing the path of rays through such an optical arrangement a lens equation for the system can be \nderived as \nSI LRRL\n1221\n12\n\u2212\u2212=  ,                                    (5.10) \nwhere LI and LS are the image and source distances respectively, for a Wolter Type I optical arrangement. \nThe MCP will only approximate a Wolter type I optic if the ray reflected from the internal surface of the \nfirst optic (i.e. that facing the optical axis) is then incident on the internal surface of the second.  \n5.2.3 Profiling \n \nFigure 5.3. Profile shape of an MCP Wolter optic defined by Equation 5.11 (after Price, 2001). \n \nThe effective area of an MCP optic to on axis sources can be increased substantially if the aspect ratio of \nmicrochannels is varied as a function of position on the optic. For the ideal Wolter system every ray will \nundergo only one reflection in each optic. For an MCP Wolter optic Willingale (1994) derives the profile \nfor both front and rear optics to be \n22\n2\n22\n1 3\nyx\nR\nyx\nR\nD\nL\n+\n=\n+\n= ,                                   (5.11) \nwhere x and y are the distance of a given microchannel from the optical axis.  The profile of an MCP \nWolter optic is shown in Figure 5.3. \n5.3 Monte Carlo raytracing of MCP optics \nThe performance of MCP optics can be modelled using Monte Carlo raytracing. A Monte Carlo approach \nallows the observation of artefacts resulting from various reflection modes which are not focussing (e.g. \nsingle reflections in only one MCP optic), effective area determination and the generation of synthetic \nimages. The effective area of an MCP optic is governed by its open area fraction, the geometrical area for \nX-ray interaction at grazing incidence and by physical equations governing X-ray interactions with the \nreflecting surfaces.  \n \nIn a Monte Carlo raytrace model, a single ray is followed through the optical system. Each time the ray \ninteracts with the MCP the physical equations governing the processes of reflection and absorption are \nused to calculate the probability of an event occurring (e.g. reflection at a given surface). A random \nnumber generator is used together with these event probabilities to determine the onward path of the X-\nray. Repeating this process for a statistically significant number of rays allows the prediction of the bulk \n 66\nperformance of the X-ray optic. By changing the physical properties of the materials used and the \ngeometrical parameters of the MCPs, the optics can be optimised for a given application.   \n5.3.1 Raytrace model structure \nThe raytrace model described here was originally designed to model the performance of the first \ngeneration of square packed, square pore MCP optics, which could only achieve point to point focussing \n(Brunton, 1994), and later the slumped Lobster\u2019s eye optics (Brunton et al., 1997) described in Chapter 1. \nIt was later modified by Price (2001) to model MCP Wolter optics and to operate into the hard X-ray (> \n10 keV) region. The model is based on a system using vector coordinates to describe the passage of rays \nthrough the optical system. This coordinate system has a Cartesian origin x = y = z = 0 defined at the \ncentre of curvature of the first slumped MCP optic, shown in Figure 5.4. The optical axis of the system is \nthe z axis. A ray\u2019s starting point is defined by a Cartesian coordinate a, and its direction is given by a unit \nvector direction b. A magnitude scalar t extends the path of the ray. The uninhibited path r of a ray is \ntherefore given by \nta br += .                                     (5.12) \n \n \nFigure 5.4. The coordinate system of the raytrace model, the x axis is in the plane of the paper. \n \nRays are generated at a source and are incident on the optic within specified area and angular constraints, \nwhich are source specific. Rays from infinity are modelled by setting their angular divergence equal to \nzero and setting the source emission area equal to the geometrical area of the MCP optic. The interception \nof the ray with the optic\u2019s front is defined where \n2. slumpR=rr .                          (5.13) \n \nHaving defined the optic\u2019s geometrical parameters, open area fraction, multifibre size and packing \ngeometry, it can be determined whether or not an incident ray enters a channel or strikes the interchannel \nweb. At interception with the front face of the MCP optic the probability that the ray enters a channel is \ncalculated and the Monte Carlo process determines whether or not it enters. If a ray enters a channel then \nthe channel co-ordinates are recorded before the channel is transformed onto the optical axis by rotation \nabout the origin. This transformation allows the reflectivity subroutine which follows to remain \n 67\nuniversally applicable to all rays. For X-rays incident on the interchannel web the probability of \ntransmission of the ray through the MCP glass into an adjacent channel is calculated. For X-ray energies \nof less than ~5 keV this calculation is superfluous as there is a very high probability of absorption. For \nhard X-rays with energies up to 100 keV transmission becomes important as X-rays can pass through the \nglass and enter adjacent microchannels. The transmission calculation is described in Section 5.3.2.  \n \nFigure 5.5. Specular reflection from a plane surface, \u03b8ref = \u03b8inc. \n \nUpon entering a channel the point of interception and angle of incidence of the ray with the channel wall \nis determined and the probability of reflection from the channel wall is then calculated. If the Monte \nCarlo process deems that the ray is reflected then any deviations from the specular direction are \ndetermined according to the surface roughness of the microchannel wall. The ray vector is then changed \nto  \ndr sc += ,                                    (5.14) \nwhere c is the point of reflection and for specular reflection (Figure 5.5) the unit vector d is given by \nbnd += inc\u03b8cos\u02c62                                    (5.15) \nWhere is the unit normal to the microchannel wall and \u03b8n\u02c6 inc is the incident angle of the X-ray measured \nfrom the surface normal given by \ninc\u03b8cos.\u02c6 =\u2212 bn .                                   (5.16) \nThe path of the ray is followed until it is incident on another surface where the process is repeated or \nleaves the first MCP. Upon incidence at the second MCP the process is repeated.  Eventually the X-ray \nbecomes extinct or is incident on the detector plane, where it is registered. This process is repeated for a \nstatistically significant number of rays \n5.3.2 X-ray transmission \nWhen an X-ray is incident on the MCP interchannel web there is a probability that it will be absorbed by \nthe MCP glass. The probability of X-ray absorption is dependent on the complex refractive index of the \nmaterial, given by Equation 1.1 as n =1- \u03b4 - i\u03b2. The coefficients  \u03b4 and \u03b2 are the refractive index \ndecrement and the absorption index, which are given by \n 68\n1Kf=\u03b4                                     (5.17) \n2Kf=\u03b2                                     (5.18) \nwhere \n\u03c1\u03c0\n\u03bb\nA\nNrK A\n2\n2\n0= ,                       (5.19)  \nr0 is the classical electron radius (given by e2\/4\u03c0\u03b50mec2 = 2.8179\u00d710-15m), NA is Avogadro\u2019s number, A is \nthe atomic number of the material and \u03c1 is the material density. The factors f1 and f2 are the atomic \nscattering factors which have been calculated from quantum mechanical models for electrons around an \natom of given Z (Cromer and Liberman, 1970, Henke, 1981).  \n \nFrom the complex refractive index the linear absorption coefficient, \u00b5ab, can be calculated, \n\u03bb\n\u03c0\u03b2\u00b5 4=ab ,                        (5.20) \n where \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength. Beer\u2019s law gives the change in intensity, I, for an X-ray beam with \ndistance into a material, t, \ntabeII \u00b5\u2212= 0 .                        (5.21) \nThe probability, Ptrans, of transmission for a single X-ray through a thickness of MCP glass t is therefore \nt\ntrans\nabeP \u00b5\u2212= .                        (5.22) \nThe values for \u00b5ab used in this thesis are calculated from the tabulated scattering factor values of Cromer \nand Liberman (1970) using the routine Xopt (Willingale, 1994). \n5.3.3 X-ray reflectivity \nIn Chapter 2 the composition of MCP detector glass is examined and is shown to have a multi layer \nstructure close to the microchannel surface. MCP optic glass is identical in bulk composition to detector \nglass but does not undergo reduction in hydrogen and as a result differs in composition close to the \nmicrochannel surface. Experimental investigations into the reflectivity of MCP glass have shown that \nbare glass MCP reflectivity is in good agreement with the modelled reflectivity of a lead\/bismuth depleted \nglass MCP layer, ~150 \u00c5 thick, upon a substrate with the MCP glass bulk composition of Chapter 2.  \nReflective metal coatings, deposited onto the microchannels to increase reflectivity, are modelled as 150 \n\u00c5 layers on a substrate of bulk MCP glass.  \n \nThe X-ray reflectivity is determined in the raytrace model by an evaluation of the Fresnel equations at the \nboundary between two media (Henke, 1981) by the Rex algorithm (Crabb et al., 1993). The multi layer \nreflectivity is also calculated by Rex using the formulae of Parratt (1954) which gives the reflectivity \ncoefficient at the plane, parallel interface between two homogenous layers n and n-1 as \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n+\n+=\n\u2212+\n\u2212+\n\u2212\u2212 1,11,\n,11,4\n1,1\nnnnn\nnnnn\nnnn FR\nFR\naR ,                                  (5.23) \nWhere the layer n+1 is a vacuum in this case and \n 69\nnn\nnn\nnn ff\nff\nF +\n\u2212=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1\n1\n,1                        (5.24) \nand  \n( )212 22 nnn if \u03b3\u03b1\u03c6 \u2212\u2212=                       (5.25) \nwhere \u03c6  is the X-ray grazing angle. The coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b3 are given by \u03b4\/2 and \u03b2\/2 respectively and \ndefine the complex dielectric constant \n\u03b3\u03b1 ik += .                        (5.26) \nThe factor an is the amplitude reduction factor defined as \n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212= \u03bb\n\u03c0 nn\nn\ndfia exp                        (5.27) \nwhere dn is the thickness of the nth layer. \n5.3.4 Surface roughness \nThe surface of a microchannel is not perfectly smooth and will not therefore produce perfect specular \nreflection. The roughness of the microchannel surface is accounted for in the raytrace model by the \nmodification of the coefficient Fn-1,n, by a Debye-Waller factor (Beckmann and Spizzichio, 1963) to \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\u2212= \u2212\u2212 \u03bb\n\u03b8\u03c0\u03c3 A\nnnnn FF\nsin4\n2\n1exp,1\n'\n,1 ,                                             (5.28) \nwhere \u03c3 is the rms roughness of the surface. The deviation of the angle of reflection from the specular \ndirection is determined according to a Gaussian distribution whose root mean square magnitude in radians \nis given by  \n\u03c6\u03c4\n\u03bb\u03c8\nsin\n=scatter ,                                   (5.29) \nwhere \u03c4 is the correlation length of the surface roughness, which is assumed to have a sinusoidal height \ndistribution (Willingale, 1994). \n5.4 The Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) \nMIXS combines the high X-ray collection efficiency of MIXS-C across a wide range of energies, \nallowing statistically significant flux detection for a wide range of line energies and for all solar states, \nwith sub-km spatial resolution provided by MIXS-T for soft X-rays during medium to high solar states. \nBoth channels require shielded, radiation hard, solid state detectors as Mercury is expected to be a high \nradiation environment and fluxes of energetic protons is expected to be high. An energy resolution of \napproximately 200 eV is required to allow proper separation of spectral lines from elements key to an \nunderstanding of the planet, given in Table 3.1, between 0.5 and 2 keV. X-ray imaging with MCP Wolter \ntype I optics has been reported by Willingale et al. (1998) and Price (2001). The application of these \noptics for remote sensing at planetary bodies has been described by Bavdaz et al. (2002).  \n \n 70\n \nFigure 5.6. Comparison of flat and slumped collimators. R is the slump radius of the slumped collimator. \n \nMIXS-C employs a spherically slumped MCP collimator instead of a conventional planar collimator \n(Figure 5.6). This collimator configuration provides a collecting power comparable with that of a flat \ncollimator whilst allowing the use of a smaller detector which is physically separated from the collimator. \nThis collimator geometry and its advantages over conventional collimator designs for planetary remote \nsensing are described in detail in Chapter 4. The extended collimator length also allows the detectors for \nboth MIXS channels to share similar detector planes and a common design. For MIXS these detectors are \nnominally mosaics of four radiation hard, GaAs active pixel arrays (Owens et al., 2002; Bavdaz et al., \n2002) with 32 x 32 ~300 \u00b5m square pixels, which are cooled to a temperature of approximately -10 \u00baC. A \ncarbon fibre telescope tube acts as additional shielding from background X-ray fluorescence and from the \nspacecraft structure (MIXS Science and Technical plan., 2004).  \n5.4.1 Imaging channel \nVariable Value \nFocal length 1m \nFront MCP slump radius 4m \nRear MCP slump radius 4\/3m \nChannel diameter 50\u00b5m \nChannel Pitch 55\u00b5m \nChannel Length 5000\u00b5m  \nMicrochannel coating Ni or Au (150\u00c5 thickness) \nCore diameter at centre of radially packed optic 6mm \nFOV 1\u00b0 half angle \nAngular resolution 2 arc minutes (optic) \nDetector GaAs active pixel array (4cm) \n \nTable 5.1.

The MCP optics proposed for HERMES were not optimised and in this section the telescope is \noptimised to enhance the science return of the instrument and practicalities of the design. Table 5.1 gives \n 71\n 72\nvalues for key parameters of the optics in the original HERMES proposal. The optic is an MCP Wolter \noptic made from radially packed square pore MCPs. The optic diameter is 21 cm. \n \n5.4.1.1 Microchannel surface coating \nMCP optics are manufactured from unreduced silicon lead glass (Chapter 2), from which X-ray \nreflectivity rapidly falls off as energy is increased above ~2 keV. For most practical applications and in \nparticular for planetary measurements, where detection of the Fe-K X-ray emission line, at 6.4 keV, may \nbe required, it is important to extend this energy range. Coating the microchannel walls with high \nreflectivity and low surface roughness metal films, can significantly increase the effective area and the \nenergy range of these optics (Peele et al., 1998; Willingale et al., 1998; Martin et. al., 1999). The coating \nmaterial must be selected on the basis of its own reflectivity versus energy profile and the position of its \nabsorption edge. For MIXS-T the requirement is to maximise the effective area (Ae) of the optic at \nenergies corresponding with X-ray emission from the key elements given in Table 3.1. \n \nThe Raytracing model described in Section 5.3 has been used to investigate the performance of the \nMIXS-T MCP optic for different coating materials. The optic parameters used were those given in Table \n5.1, but with different coating materials. A root mean square surface roughness of 10 \u00c5 is assumed and \nthe MCP microchannels are modelled as being perfectly aligned. The calculated effective area, Ae, as a \nfunction of energy for bare glass, nickel, gold and iridium channel coatings is shown in Figure 5.7. The \ncoating is assumed to be 150 \u00c5 thick in each case. Uncoated glass is modelled as a bilayer with a 150 \u00c5 \nsurface layer of lead\/bismuth depleted MCP glass on a substrate of bulk MCP glass (Brunton et al., \n1999). Figure 5.7 also shows the emission energies of the K series X-ray emission lines of some key \nelements of interest in the context of observations of Mercury. By selecting Ir as the coating of choice the \nenergy range of the instrument is extended significantly and Ae is increased at all energies above 1 keV. \nThere is a small loss of effective area below 1 keV compared to bare glass. Although effective areas for \nNi are in general greater for most elements of interest shown in Figure 5.7, the improvement in effective \narea at Fe-K is significant enough that Ir has been deemed to be a preferential coating. A programme to \ntest the reflectivities of coated MCP optics using the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) is \nongoing and some preliminary results have been obtained (Nussey, 2005). Note that the coated MCPs \ninvestigated by Nussey are early production samples, and a programme to optimise the coatings is \ncurrently underway (Fairbend, 2005; Aaltonen et al., 2004). The primary driver for the choice of coating \nfor MIXS-T will in fact be the maturity of the coating technology and the quality of the coatings \nproduced, though the energy of secondary fluorescence emission from the coating is also a factor in their \nselection. The results of the reflectivity studies made to date indicate that iridium is the coating with the \nhighest quality.  \n \nFigure 5.7. Variation of effective area with energy for the HERMES format optic with different coatings. \nOther MCP format variables remain the same as in Table 5.1. \n \n5.4.1.2 Focal length and profiling \n \nFigure 5.8. Variation of effective area with energy curves for profiled and non-profiled, iridium coated, \nMCP Wolter optics for the telescope with different focal lengths. a-e indicate Ir absorption edges MI-MV: \na=2.040 keV; b=2.116 keV; c=2.551 keV; d=2.909 keV;  e=3.174 keV. Energies of the K-shell \nfluorescence emission for key elements are also shown. \n 73\n 74\n \nThe proposed BepiColombo spacecraft bus has a depth of 70 cm (ESA-SCI(2000)1) compared with a \nnominal baseline focal length for the optic of 1m (Owens et al., 2001). This adds difficulty to \naccommodation of the optic in the spacecraft and requires that the telescope be extended beyond the edge \nof the spacecraft. The focal length of the optic can be altered to match the bus depth by altering the slump \nradii of the front and rear MCPs in accordance with Equations 5.9 and 5.10 but as focal length is reduced \ngrazing incidence angles are increased. This reduces the probability of reflection and effective area is \nreduced.  The modelled effective area curves for Ir coated optics with focal lengths of both 70 cm and 1 m \nare shown in Figure 5.8. Reducing the focal length from 1 m to 0.7 m results in ~30% decrease in on axis \neffective area arising from the increased grazing angles required. This reduction in effective area is \nsignificant and will result in a significant loss of flux. This unacceptable especially at higher energies (e.g. \nFe-K at 6.4 keV) where X-ray fluxes and effective area are both low. Thus a system to maintain a 1 m \nfocal length is preferred. A reduction in focal length should be avoided and a 1 m focal length is assumed \nin all further calculations. \n \nAltering the aspect ratio of the MCP as a function of distance from the optic centre, or \u201cprofiling\u201d, \naccording to Equation 5.11, increases the effective area by maximising the probability of a reflection \noccurring in a channel for an on axis X-ray. The curves in Figure 5.8 compare the on-axis effective area \nwith energy for a profiled optic and a non-profiled optic with a 100:1 channel aspect ratio. Profiling \nresults in a peak increase in effective area of approximately 450%. Figure 5.8 also shows the influence of \nthe Ir M-edges (Thompson et al., 2001) between 2.04 and 3.174 keV on Ae at the energies of fluorescent \nlines from Ca, Ti and Fe.  \n \n5.4.1.3 Core diameter \nThe MCP optic will have a non-focussing, opaque central core. This core has a nominal diameter of 6 mm \nfollowing Bavdaz et al. (2002), Owen et al. (2001) and Price (2001). The final diameter of this central \ncore is not yet defined but will be dependent on the support requirements for the optic. It has been \nsuggested that the diameter should be extended by up to ~15 mm to allow for the structure to support the \nmosaic of MCPs which will make up the optic (Pearson, 2004). The resultant change in effective area is \nshown in Figure 5.9. The larger core size has a negative effect on effective area, reducing the effective \narea by approximately 10% below 1 keV and by approximately 5% for energies beyond the Ir absorption \nedge. Minimisation of the core diameter is required but this will be constrained primarily by practical \nsupport requirements the details of which are yet to be determined.  \n  \n \nFigure 5.9. Variation of effective area  with energy for a profiled, Ir coated, MIXS-T optic with  core \ndiameters of 6 mm and 15 mm. Other variables describing the optic format are as in Table 5.1. \n \n5.4.1.4 Microchannel diameter \n 75\n \nFigure 5.10. Variation of effective area with energy of the baseline optic (50 \u00b5m pore side length, 55 \u00b5m \npitch and 21 cm diameter) and an \u201coptimised optic\u201d (20 \u00b5m pore diameter, 22 \u00b5m pitch and 21 cm optic \ndiameter). \n 76\n \nThe nominal square pore diameter for both front and rear MCPs is 50 \u00b5m with a pitch of 55 \u00b5m, and the \nnominal diameter of the optic is 21 cm following Price (2001) and Bavdaz et al. (2002). To achieve a 2 \narcminute angular resolution at 1m the instrument must have a full width half maximum focus in the focal \nplane of less than Ftan(2arcminutes) = 582 \u00b5m. This is also the minimum pixel size required for a \npixelated focal plane detector. Raytracing shows that the nominal 50 \u00b5m microchannel side length MCP \nformat has a FWHM focus of approximately 800 \u00b5m corresponding to a 2.75 arcminute resolution, and \nnot the sub 2 arcminute resolution required. A reduction in pore diameter to 20 \u00b5m, whilst holding the \nopen area fraction constant, is found to increase the resolution of the telescope to ~400 \u00b5m in the detector \nplane, corresponding to an angular resolution of 1.38 arcminutes. Comparable resolutions have already \nbeen achieved in prototype MCP Wolter optics with 10\u00b5m channel diameters (Price et al., 2002). In true \noptics the resolution will be limited by microchannel misalignments. A recent ESA Technology Research \nProgramme at Photonis SAS (Brive) has sought to minimise the problems of channel misalignment and \nso perfectly aligned channels have been assumed in these simulations.  \n \nFigure 5.10 compares a 1m focal length, profiled, Ir coated optic with a 15 mm diameter core size and \n50\u00b5m diameter microchannels, with a similar telescope using an optic with 20 \u00b5m diameter pores. A \nsignificant increase in effective area is observed across all energies for the latter design. A reduction in \npore size reduces the lengths of microchannels and increases their number. In doing so the conic \napproximation of the MCP to the Wolter geometry is improved leading to an increase in effective area.  \n \n5.4.1.5 Off axis vignetting and detector size \nThe off axis vignetting function is given by the effective area at an off axis angle \u03b8 as a fraction of the on \naxis effective area. The vignetting function calculated by raytracing for the profiled optic with a 1m focal \nlength is shown in Figure 5.11 including a 6th order polynomial approximation to the vignetting function \nat 2500 eV. The HERMES telescope\u2019s FOV was stated to be 2\u00b0, for which there must be an appreciable \neffective area at 1\u00b0 off axis. Figure 5.11 shows the off axis vignetting function of the MIXS-T optic \nsimulated by raytracing 100000 rays through a profiled 210 mm diameter optic with a 15 mm diameter \ncore and 20 \u00b5m side length pores on a 22 \u00b5m pitch. The surface coating is 150 \u00c5 of iridium with a 10 \u00c5 \nrms surface roughness. The effective area is dominated by flux within 0.5\u00b0 of the optical axis. The FOV \nmay therefore be reduced to 1\u00b0 to achieve a reduced focal plane size with a minimal loss of detected flux. \nThe area under the curve in Figure 5.11 within 0.5\u00b0 of the optical axis is 79 % of the total within 1\u00b0 at 0.5 \nkeV increasing to 96 % at 5 keV. Reducing the focal plane to 1\u00b0 may prove optimal for MIXS but the \nremaining calculations here assume a 2\u00b0 FOV in order to maximise the observed flux. \n \nFigure 5.11. Off axis vignetting function for MIXS-T at different energies. The dashed lines are 6th order \npolynomial approximations to the vignetting functions. \n \nAlso shown in Figure 5.11 are 6th order polynomial approximations to the vignetting function V(\u03b8) at \neach energy. The fluctuations in the vignetting functions shown in Figure 5.11 result from statistical \nvariations in the Monte Carlo raytrace model and are not real. It is therefore justified to apply polynomial \nsmoothing functions for the following analyses. The polynomials are, for 500 eV; \n0898.15098.5849.13753.17309.110613.31.696)V( 23456 +\u2212+\u2212+\u2212= \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 ,          (5.30) \nfor 1 keV; \n0815.19385.5478.16149.24822.183117.71.0979)V( 23456 +\u2212+\u2212+\u2212= \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 ,       (5.31) \nfor 2.5 keV; \n0865.13488.7761.22751.36664.31788.13384.2)V( 23456 +\u2212+\u2212+\u2212= \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 ,         (5.32) \nfor 5 keV; \n1102.17888.8818.29806.51875.4737.22157.4)V( 23456 +++\u2212+\u2212= \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8 ,          (5.33) \n \nFor a 2\u00b0 FOV the detector plane must be large enough to view the focus generated by sources at infinity, \nboth on axis and at 1\u00b0 off axis. The off axis distance in the detector plane of a ray incident with an off axis \nangle of 1\u00b0 is equal to Ftan2\u00b0 = 3.5 cm. Figure 5.12 shows the raytraced positions of foci in the detector \nplane resulting from three sources at 0 \u00ba, 0.5 \u00ba and 1 \u00ba off axis. A detector with a 4 cm side length and \n16cm2 area is sufficient to provide a 2\u00b0 FOV. If a 1\u00b0 FOV is adopted in the detector plane then a detector \nof side length 2 cm and area 4 cm2 is sufficient. Accepting a MIXS-T FOV of 1\u00b0 rather than 2\u00b0 will \ntherefore allow a reduction in the required focal plane detector area by a factor 4, with little loss of flux. \nThis will allow the use of a single 32x32 pixel GaAs active pixel sensor in the detector plane instead of \nthe mosaic of four originally proposed. \n \n 77\nThe coma in Figure 5.12 is the result of rays undergoing a single reflection in the second MCP (even-odd \nreflections) only. The fraction of rays in the coma for the 0.5\u00b0 off-axis case is approximately 14 % of \nthose in the focus, rising to approximately 33 % in the 1\u00b0 off-axis case. \n \nFigure 5.12. Raytraced image of the telescope (focal length 1m) detector plane for point sources at \ninfinity, 0\u00ba, 0.5\u00ba and 1\u00ba off axis. \n \n5.4.1.6 MIXS-T performance  \n \nFigure 5.13. Variation of on axis effective area for  MIXS-T as a function of energy including a 21 cm \ndiameter, profiled MCP optic with perfectly aligned 20 \u00b5m wide pores, a 150 \u00c5 thick Ir coating with 10 \u00c5 \nrms surface roughness, an 80 nm Al optical filter, a GaAs detector with a 100 \u00b5m depletion depth and \nvarying GaAs substrate dead layer thickness. \n \n 78\n 79\nThe effective area curves presented thus far assume a 100 % efficient filter and detector. Figure 5.13 \nintroduces the response of an 80 nm thick Al optical filter and a GaAs detector with a 100 \u00b5m depletion \nlayer. The thickness of the detector dead layer, in which incomplete charge collection occurs, is varied \nbetween 0.01 \u00b5m and 0.1 \u00b5m. The design goal for these detectors is 0.05 \u00b5m. \n5.4.2 Collimating channel  \nThe high spatial resolution and narrow FOV of MIXS-T is complemented by MIXS-C\u2019s lower angular \nresolution but larger collecting power. The aspect ratio of the MIXS-C microchannels is chosen to \nprovide the required acceptance angle for the energy independent \u201cstraight through\u201d, collimated \ncomponent of the flux. The collimated channel\u2019s large collecting power, quantified by the grasp which is \ndefined in Chapter 4, compared with that of the imaging channel, ensures global coverage at low spatial \nresolution for all levels of solar activity. The collimator\u2019s grasp is also independent of energy, providing a \ngreater number of counts at all energies and hence improved statistics in measurements of X-ray emission \nlines and the resultant calculated surface elemental abundances. This is of particular use for surface \nelements emitting X-rays at energies greater than 2 keV for which MIXS-T\u2019s effective area is low. \n \n5.4.2.1 Collimator geometrical parameters \nThe BepiColumbo Spacecraft bus is nominally a cube with a 70 cm side length and it is assumed that \ncooling of the detectors for both channels will be provided by a single cold finger in the focal plane of the \ntelescope. Both channels must have the same pointing direction and should use GaAs detectors of \nidentical format. The width of the square MCP collimator is 8cm and the \u201cfocal\u201d length of the collimator \nis selected to be 50 cm, 20 cm shorter than the bus length and requiring an MCP slump radius of 1 m. The \n20 cm shortfall in length can be made up by the introduction of a cold shelf shown in Figure 5.1 (MIXS \nScience and Technical plan, 2004). Lengthening the collimator reduces both the FOV and the collimator \ngrasp. A 50 cm collimator length is a trade off between maintaining the high grasp of an R = 40 cm \ncollimator calculated in Chapter 4 and accommodation within the spacecraft. The detector is nominally a \n4cm mosaic (half the collimator side length) of four 32x32 pixel GaAs active pixel arrays, identical to \nthat used for the telescope. Matching the aspect ratio of the collimator to the subtended angle of the 8cm \ndiameter slumped MCP at its centre of curvature gives an L\/D of 25:1. The effective area of the MIXS-C \ncollimator, as a function of off-axis angle, is shown in Figure 5.14. The FWHM of the curve is 4.6\u00b0 and \nthe FWZM is 9.2\u00b0. Both FWHM and FWZM can potentially be used to define the collimator\u2019s FOV. \n \nFigure 5.14. Effective area with off axis angle for the collimated channel accounting for the 4 cm \ndetector size. The energy response of the detector is not accounted for. \n \nThe 4cm detector utilised by MIXS-C is too small to cover the complete \u201cfocal plane\u201d. The fraction of \ntransmitted rays hitting the detector for this collimator geometry is shown in Chapter 4 to be 0.7. Figure \n5.14 shows the raytraced off axis effective area of the collimated channel, accounting for the detector\u2019s \nsize, but neglecting the detector\u2019s energy response. The MIXS-C FWHM FOV is now 5.2\u00b0. The FWZM \nFOV is now 9.2\u00b0 \n \nIn its final configuration MIXS-C has an 8 cm side length square MCP collimator with square \nmicrochannels, which have an aspect ratio of 25:1. The MCP slump radius is 1m and the instrument has a \n4cm side length mosaic of GaAs active pixel array detectors centred on the collimator axis at a distance of \n50 cm from the collimator.  \n \n5.4.2.2 MIXS-C Effective Area \nThe flux of X-rays transmitted by a collimator is not energy dependent and so variations in the effective \narea with energy are due entirely to the instrument\u2019s filter and detector. The filter and detector are \nassumed to be GaAs arrays identical to those on MIXS-T. Figure 5.15 shows the on axis effective area as \na function of energy for MIXS-C incorporating these elements. The absorption of each layer is calculated \nfrom Beer\u2019s law with the linear absorption coefficient calculated as described in Chapter 4. \n 80\n \nFigure 5.15. On axis effective area as a function of  energy for MIXS-C with 8 cm diameter collimator, \n25:1 aspect ratio channel , 1 m slump radius, 80 nm Al filter and a 4 cm GaAs detector with 100 \u00b5m thick \nactive region and 500 \u00c5 dead-layer thickness. The detector is located 50 cm from the collimator. The Ga, \nAs, Ir and Al absorption edges combine to produce the sharp drop in effective area above 1 keV.  \n5.4.3 MIXS-T and MIXS-C Grasps \nFor an instrument with a circular FOV the solid angular element d\u2126 subtended by an element d\u03b8 at an off-\naxis angle \u03b8 is given by \n\u03b8\u03c0\u03b8dd 2=\u2126                         (5.34) \nand the off axis effective area A(\u03b8) is \n)()0()( \u03b8\u03b8 VAA = ,                       (5.35) \nwhere A(0) is the on axis effective area and V(\u03b8) is the vignetting function.

Table 5.2 gives the percentage of the nominal one year mission time that X, M, \nC and B flare solar states can be expected based on the assumption that solar activity at this time will be \nsimilar to that recorded between 1996 and 1998. High activity (C, M and X states), will result in high \nlevels of fluorescence and will allow high resolution imaging of the surface by MIXS-T. These solar flare \nstates are expected for approximately 1 % of the mission (MIXS Science and Technology plan, 2004). \nSuch a statistical approach does not however allow for single large events such as the X-class flare of \nNovember 2003 (Liu et al., 2004). \n 84\n5.5.2 Surface coverage \n \nFigure 5.19. Change in the argument of periherm (\u03c9). Yellow line is the plane of the ecliptic. The orbit \nmarked in green has an argument of periherm \u03c91, the orbit marked in blue occurs at a later stage in the \nmission and has an argument of periherm \u03c92. The sub-satellite latitude at the two periherm points is \ndifferent as the argument of the periherm has precessed. In this case, exposure times will be different for \nnorthern and southern hemispheres (image used courtesy of  N. Bannister). \n \nThe surface coverage achieved by MIXS, assuming a 1\u00b0 FOV over a nominal one year mission has been \nestimated by Bannister (2006) by solving Kepler\u2019s equation for the published orbital parameters for the \nBepiColumbo Mercury Polar Orbiter (MPO) (ESA-SCI(2000)1), folding in a triangular approximation to \nthe calculated off axis vignetting function of MIXS-T and the cosine of the angle of incidence for solar X-\nrays. This solution accounts for the precession of the argument of periherm, defined as the angle, in the \nplane of the satellite\u2019s orbit, between the ascending node of the orbit and the periherm point, measured in \nthe direction of the satellite\u2019s orbit and shown in Figure 5.19. The resultant coverage map for MIXS-T \nduring a one year nominal mission is shown in Figure 5.20 including only dayside observations, \nneglecting any measurements possible through particle interactions with the surface and accounting for \nthe changing incident angle of solar X-rays.  \n \nBoth MIXS instrument channels will achieve global coverage but the increased throughput of MIXS-C \nensures that elemental maps of limited resolution but improved counting statistics are obtained for the \nentire surface.  The average pixel exposure time for MIXS-T between \u00b170\u00ba of Mercury\u2019s equator is ~200 \ns. Assuming a worst case scenario in which adjacent observations to not overlap the observation time for \na 2\u00b0 FOV is 400 s. Removing the triangular vignetting function assumed by Bannister (2006) in this \nmodel using Equation 5.36 results in an increase to 1200 s of observation time. \n \n 85\n \nFigure 5.20. Hammer-Aitoff projection showing the coverage time accumulated over Mercury\u2019s surface \nby MIXS-T  for the one-year nominal mission calculated by Bannister (2006). The coverage  map \naccounts for a triangular approximation to the vignetting function and the cosine of the solar incidence \nangle. Variations in colour scale represent various accumulated observation times for each surface pixel. \n5.5.3 Predicted fluxes and composition \nThe predicted solar state and resultant spectra calculated by the method introduced in Chapter 3 have \nbeen used to calculate the Fluorescent X-ray fluxes from the surface into 2\u03c0 steradians. Solar X-rays are \nassumed to be at normal incidence to the planet\u2019s surface and a sub-solar nadir view is assumed for the \nobservations (equivalent to equatorial observations). The number of X-rays detected for each elemental \nline of interest and for each solar state, within a single geometrical footprint, are calculated from synthetic \nspectra of the type shown in Figure 3.5. The detected X-ray flux Fline, at an emission line at an energy \nEline, for which fluorescent X-rays have an intensity Iline (photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1) for an instrument with a \ngrasp at the energy of the line G(Eline) and footprint dwell time t is given by  \ntEGIF linelineline )(= ,                            (5.43) \nThe total flux detected by an instrument with a finite energy resolution \u2206E, including both line and \ncontinuum X-rays is given by \n\u222b += 2\n1\n)())((det\nE\nE\ncontline tdEEGEIIF ,                                             (5.44) \nwhere Icont(E) is the continuum flux in photons\/(cm2 s keV), E1=Eline-\u2206E\/2 and E2=Eline+\u2206E\/2; \u2206E for a \nGaAs active pixel array is assumed to be 200 eV at all energies as this is the resolution required for \nseparation of the spectral lines of interest at Mercury. The pixel dwell time for MIXS-T at apoherm is 39 \ns and at periherm is 5.4 s. The dwell time for MIXS-C is 165.29s at apoherm and 22.98 s at periherm \n(Bannister 2006). The surface area under observation will increase with the square of altitude, whilst the \nflux from a given area will decrease with the square of altitude. The total detected flux from the surface is \ntherefore independent of altitude. \n \n 86\nIf a residual charged particle background is assumed to be in line with that experienced by the XMM-\nNewton X-ray telescope at 0.026 cm-2 s-1 (Lumb, 2002) and the focal plane arrays for both channels have \nan area of 16 cm2 then for 5\u03c3 detection of planetary emission more than 20 detected events are required at \napoherm and more than 7.4 events are required at periherm, from a given footprint for MIXS-T. For \nMIXS-C more than 41.5 counts are required at apoherm and more than 15 are required at periherm.  \n \nSimulated spectra in counts s-1 as a function of energy for MIXS-T and MIXS-C for B1, C1 and M1 solar \nflare states and assuming surface compositions in line with the refractory rich and volatile rich models of \nformation are shown in Figures 5.21 \u2013 5.24. The lines are shown as Gaussian peaks with a FWHM energy \nresolution of 125 eV to approximate the energy resolution of the detectors, though a poorer energy \nresolution is likely. The predicted line and continuum fluxes detected for a single footprint measurement \nat apoherm and periherm, for M1, B1, C1 and solar quiet flare states are given in Tables 5.3 and 5.4 for \nMIXS-T and in Tables 5.5 and 5.6 for MIXS-C. \n \n \nFigure 5.21.

The observations were made in July 2001 using the I2 and I3 \nfront illuminated chips of the Advanced CCD for Imaging Spectroscopy (ACIS) instrument (Garmire et \nal, 2003). \n \nThe fluorescence model has been used to estimate the line fluxes (photons per unit lunar surface area per \nunit time into 2\u03c0 sr) for solar flare state, which is based on solar activity measured during the \nobservations by GOES. The lunar composition is assumed to be uniformly that of lunar mare basalt \n(Truscott et al., 2000). The calculations assume that the illuminated lunar surface is perfectly smooth, \nneglecting the factor of ~2 that may be introduced by surface roughness (Okada et al., 2002 and 2004). \nThe geometry of the observations is summarised in Table 1, which gives the inputs for the modelled data. \nThe geometry is an approximation to the true geometry from that illustrated by Wargelin et al. (2004) \n(accurate values for observation angles are not given). The QE(E) assumed is the pre launch QE of the I1 \nCCD from the Chandra Science data centre1. The mean effective area for a single Chandra I CCD, over \nits FOV is assumed to be approximately 0.8 times the on axis value1 stated in Table 1. The solar flare \nstate measured by GOES during July 2001 was variable between B1 and C1 background states. The \nmodel is in good agreement with the Wargelin et al. data if the flare state is approximated as having \nTruscott et al. C1 flare like properties below 0.6 keV and B1 flare like properties above 0.6 keV. \n \nInput Value \nCombined I2 and I3 observation time (s)1 8063 \nPeak ACIS-I Effective area (cm2)2 600 \nSolid angle subtended by a single chip (sr)1 5.9x10-6\nSolar state3 B-C flare variable \nLunar surface composition4 Mare Basalt  \nMean angle of observations (\u00b0)1 45 \nMean angle of incident solar X-rays (\u00ba)1 45 \nTable 5.7.

The technique allows the determination of surface elemental \ncomposition from orbit and the generation of global elemental composition maps. Such maps of Mercury \nwill place constraints on possible formation mechanisms and the evolution of the planet. An \nunderstanding of processes which define Mercury\u2019s history will enhance our understanding of the \nformation and evolution of the solar system as a whole.  \n \n 93\n 94\nPrevious orbital measurements of fluorescent X-rays have been made using collimated proportional \ncounters whose spatial and spectral resolution is severely limited. The Mercury Imaging X-ray \nSpectrometer uses MCP Wolter optics to provide fine spatial resolution through true imaging, during \nperiods of high solar activity, and an MCP collimator, with a slumped geometry and guaranteed global \ncoverage, at lower spatial resolution but at all energies of interest and regardless of solar state. The \nsurface resolution achieved will always be less than a few tens of km and under appropriate conditions \ncan be less than 200 m. This is a three order of magnitude increase in achievable resolution when \ncompared with the resolving capability of the X-ray spectrometer on MESSENGER, whose surface \nresolution is just less than the planet\u2019s diameter for most of its orbit.  \n \nThe detectors for both MIXS-C and MIXS-T are identical radiation hard GaAs active pixel arrays (Owens \net al., 2002), providing much improved spectral and spatial resolution when compared to GPC detectors. \nThe slumped collimator geometry separates the collimator and detector planes and reduces the required \ndetector size allowing the practical introduction of these detectors. Factors affecting the performance of \nboth instrument channels have been optimised to produce the maximum Effective area possible and \nmaximise the science return of the instrument.

The signal from the surface will be \ndominated by O-K X-rays but will also contain significant number of X-rays from key elements of \ninterest for studies of Mercury. MIXS-C will provide statistically significant measurements of these \nspectral lines for all solar states at low resolution, while MIXS-T provides higher spatial resolution for \nsome solar states. For M and X flare states MIXS-T may provide true imaging of the surface. For low \nsolar states integration times for MIXS-T can be increased with a loss of spatial resolution.  \nCHAPTER 6 \n \n6 Detecting Interplanetary Dust and Space Debris with \nFilmed MCPs \n \n6.1 Introduction \nThe basic optical unit of the proposed Lobster-ISS X-ray telescope (Fraser et al., 2002) is a square pore \nMCP optic which, in order to reduce its absorptivity \u03b1, bears a thin (~10 nm) aluminium barrier film over \nthe channel entrances. Filmed MCPs were originally developed as ion barriers for night vision intensifiers \n(Williams et al., 1991). \n \nFigure 6.1. Mounting location of the samples on the outer surface of the Docking Compartment No. 1 \n\u201cPirs\u201d (image courtesy of Kayser-Threde GmbH and RKK Energia, Moscow) \n \nBetween 2002 and 2004 two aluminium-filmed circular-pore MCP witness samples, manufactured by \nPhotonis SAS (Brive, France), were flown on the International Space Station (ISS). They were exposed to \nthe space environment on the Russian docking module (Pirs) for 756 days as part of the X-ray Mirror \nExpose Experiment (Hofer, 2004). The location of this experiment on the ISS is shown in Figure 6.1. The \nram, wake, zenith and nadir directions are true for a standard ISS local vertical local horizontal (LVLH) \nattitude. This deployment, an opportunity made possible by collaboration with Keyser-Threde GmbH \n(Berlin) and the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik (Garching), was intended to evaluate \nthe long-term effects of the ISS environment on the thermal properties of MCP optics. The experiment is \nshown in situ on the ISS in Figure 6.2. \n 96\n \nFigure 6.2. The two Al filmed MCPs in situ on the International Space Station. \n \nAfter return to the University of Leicester, the samples were examined to determine (i) the effects of \ncontamination and erosion on the film absorptivity and emissivity which are described in Carpenter et al. \n(2006) and are not included in this thesis and (ii) the effects of particle collisions, reported in this chapter.  \n \nMost in-situ measurements of the near-Earth dust environment have been made using retrieved surfaces \nand foils. Active sensors, detecting impact ionisation plasmas or the flashes of light associated with \nhypervelocity impacts (Auer, 2001) have also been flown. In the case of retrieved foils and surfaces the \nmeasured parameter is a hole or crater diameter, Dh. Previously flown foils, with thicknesses in excess of \n1 \u00b5m, have been sensitive to particles with diameters dp > 0.1 \u00b5m. In Sections 6.2 and 6.3 below it is \nshown that MCPs such as those exposed on the ISS, with film thicknesses more than one order of \nmagnitude less than a typical free-standing foil, provide access to previously inaccessible dust \ndistributions. \n \nThe results of the analysis presented here may have significant implications for the understanding of \ninterplanetary dust and space debris and lead to future dedicated cosmic dust experiments based on the \nfilmed MCP technology. The development of an active detector based on the thin film technology could \noffer a simple, inexpensive means of detecting nanometre scale particles in the near Earth environment \nand throughout the solar system.  \n6.2 Filmed MCPs \nThe retrieved MCP samples bear a very thin (60 nm, monitored with a crystal balance during the \ndeposition process) aluminium film coating on one face, which is supported by the lead silicate glass \ninter-channel web between hexagonally packed 12.5 \u00b5m diameter microchannels. This film is applied by \nevaporation on to a lacquer, which is then floated on to the MCP before being baked away, leaving the Al \nfilm (Fairbend, 2005). The rectangular MCP samples and their Macor support are shown after their return \nto Leicester in Figure 6.3. The exposed area analysed was circular, 12 mm in diameter and over the \nexamination hole of sample 1. The exposure time was calculated to be 6.5x107 s.  \n 97\n  \nFigure 6.3. Retrieved, filmed MCP samples and their Macor support. Sample 1, with the aluminium film \non its external face, is the exposed sample analysed here. Sample 2 has the aluminium film on its internal \nface so the solid angle exposed to space is reduced by the 40:1 aspect ratio of the microchannels. \n \nAlthough the main pre-flight interest in these films was on their properties as thermal control layers for \nMCP X-ray telescopes, they are also highly sensitive micrometeoroid detectors. McDonnell and Sullivan \n(1992) present an empirical formula describing the maximum foil thickness Fmax that an impacting \nparticle with known properties can perforate, also called the ballistic limit,  \n806.0\n134.0476.0\n056.0max 272.1 vd\nd\nF\nt\nAl\nt\nAl\nFe\np\np\np\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b= \u03c3\n\u03c3\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n.             (6.1) \nIn the equation dp is the diameter of the impacting particle, \u03c1p is its densitye, \u03c1t is the density of the foil \nand \u03c1Fe and \u03c1Al are the densities of iron and aluminium; \u03c3Al and \u03c3t are the tensile strengths of aluminium \nand the target material respectively and v is the velocity of the impactor. McDonnell and Sullivan define \nFmax when the hole diameter Dh is equal to the foil thickness. It should be noted however that this \ndefinition is not universal; other equations such as that of Gardner et al. (1997) define Fmax where Dh = 0.  \n \nAlmost all ballistic limit equations have been determined through microparticle accelerator experiments. \nEquation 6.1 has been determined using micron scale iron spherules impacting at velocities of 1-16 km s-1 \nonto foils with thicknesses of the order of microns. It may not be justified to apply this equation to \nnanometre scale evaporated films, where impact mechanics may be quite different, but no data exists for \nimpacts on such foils. Currently available empirical relationships can therefore give only a first order \nindication of the potential impact properties of these films. \n \nUsing Equation 6.1, the minimum particle size required to perforate a 60 nm thick Al film is ~23 nm at a \nvelocity of 20 km s-1, and ~9 nm at 70 km s-1. These velocities are chosen because they represent peaks in \n 98\n 99\n                                                \nthe velocity distribution of interplanetary dust particles impacting on the Long Duration Exposure Facility \n(LDEF) (McDonnell et al., 2001). Such particles are almost two orders of magnitude smaller that those \ndetected by previously flown foils.  \n \nNanometer scale particles have been detected in streams from the Jovian and Saturnian systems (Gr\u00fcn et \nal., 2001) where acceleration by the large magnetic fields to velocities of around 100-300 km s-1 provide \neven very small dust particles with sufficient energy to be detected by the Cassini spacecraft\u2019s cosmic \ndust analyser (Srama et al.,  2004). In the near Earth environment such particles will have greatly reduced \ncollision energies and will have been undetectable by foils with thicknesses on the micrometer scale or \nany other previously flown instrumentation. \n \nParticles in near Earth Space can also originate from man\u2019s activities in space. These debris particles can \nbe ejecta from larger impacts on other space craft surfaces, flakes of paint from surfaces, which have \nbecome brittle following exposure to atomic oxygen, fragments from spacecraft explosions and collisions, \nslag from solid rocket motors, Al2O3 dust particles, also ejected by solid rocket motors and droplets of \nNaK coolant ejected from the retired soviet RORSAT spacecraft nuclear reactors (Kessler et al., 1997). \nThe velocities of these populations are in general less than those for the natural micrometeoroid \nbackground making small particles more difficult to detect.  \n6.3 Characterisation of the exposed nanofilm \nScanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a Phillips XL30 SEM in the engineering department at the \nUniversity of Leicester, was used to determine the size distribution of holes in the retrieved samples. \nFigure 6.4 shows an SEM image of holes in the film; one hundred and thirty three such images were \nacquired and analysed, covering a total area of 2.75 mm2, or approximately 3 % of the total sensitive area \nafter accounting for the 63 % open area fraction of the microchannel array. All images were obtained with \nan electron accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV. At higher accelerating voltages the electron range in \naluminium is much greater than the film thickness and the film becomes less visible.  \n \nSEM images like Figure 6.4 were analysed using the ImageJ analysis package2, which was used to \nidentify holes, calculate their area and determine their circularity,  c, given by 4\u03c0(hole area\/perimeter2). \nA c value of 1.0 indicates a perfect circle while a value approaching zero indicates an increasingly \nelongated or freeform shape. A circularity filter was applied in order to discriminate against irregularly \nshaped holes, which are less likely to have resulted from hypervelocity impacts, and holes close to the \ninterchannel web.  \n \n \n2 (http:\/\/rsb.info.nih.gov\/ij\/) \n \nFigure 6.4. Representative SEM image of holes in the aluminium film \n \nHypervelocity impacts tend to produce approximately circular holes in foils for particles with diameters \nsimilar ton or smaller than the film thickness, although holes can become increasingly elongated with \nincreased angle of incidence (McDonnell and Gardner, 1998). Experience with impacts on thicker foils \nexposed to dust and debris populations in orbit has indicated that holes with Dh < 10f, where f is foil \nthickness, tend to be highly circular while irregularly shaped holes can result from particles with dp >> f, \nwhich punch through the film leaving an impression of the particle\u2019s cross section (McDonnell and \nGardner, 1998). Large holes with sizes approaching the channel diameter, and holes occurring close to \nthe channel walls, are likely to be distorted by the interchannel web and will be non-circular. For the very \nsmallest holes (Dh < 500 nm), approaching the image resolution, the calculated circularity is unreliable \nbecause the hole size approaches the area of a single image pixel. Of the SEM sample, of 2323 holes, \n2222 had circularity c > 0.5, 1216 had c > 0.8. The variation of mean circularity with hole diameter is \nshown in Figure 6.5. \n \nCircularity tends to decrease as particle diameters become significantly larger than the film thickness and \nthe diameters of the resulting holes increase. The circularity tends to 1 as diameter goes to zero except for \nthe smallest holes for which the circularity filter is likely to be incorrect as hole diameters approach the \nimage resolution, introducing errors in the circularity value for very small holes. As hole diameters \napproach that of the circular microchannel diameters the circularity increases following a minima at \nDh=microchannel diameter\/2. This results from the microchannel walls limiting the size of the holes in \nthe film.  \n \n 100\n \nFigure 6.5. Mean circularity c of holes in the film as a function of diameter. \n \nConventional SEM imaging had insufficient resolution to image holes smaller than ~500 nm and was \ntherefore only suitable for resolving impact damage by particles with ballistic limits, Fmax, much greater \nthan that of the film thickness. Subsequent images obtained with a newly commissioned Field Electron \nGun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEGSEM), in the Department of Engineering at the University of \nLeicester, allowed the resolution of holes with diameters close to the film thickness and therefore close to \nthe particle detection limit of the films. Figure 6.6 shows a FEGSEM image obtained with an accelerating \nvoltage of 2 kV of a hole in the film with a diameter of ~100 nm. This feature has a morphology typical \nof the larger impact holes observed in thicker foils, a raised rim and regular shape. The particles which \ngenerated these holes must be smaller than the hole diameter. These impact holes are the smallest \nhypervelocity impact features ever imaged, generated by the smallest particles of dust\/debris ever \ndetected in near Earth space. \n \nFigure 6.6. FEGSEM image of one of the smallest holes observed in the Al film. \n \n 101\nThe improved resolution of FEGSEM imaging has also allowed the observation of craters in the \ninterchannel web, which were previously unobservable in SEM images. An example crater is shown in \nFigure 6.7. These craters would be more challenging to observe on bare glass but the contrast between the \nglass and the overlying film allows the craters to be observed. Observation of the craters lends confidence \nto an impact origin for the holes. Insufficient craters have been observed however to provide a crater size \ndistribution and a measurement of impactor flux independent of that obtained from the hole size \ndistribution. \n \nImpact holes which are much larger than the film thickness have variable morphologies. Some, like that \nshown in Figure 6.8, are elliptical. For these features the ratio of the major and minor axes of the ellipse \nmay be used as a measure of the particle\u2019s incident direction. Irregularly shaped dark features around the \nimpact hole may indicate subsurface damage caused during the impact. Other impact features are more \nirregular in shape, like that in Figure 6.9. These holes may be generated by particles with diameters much \ngreater than the film thickness and serve as a record of the particle\u2019s shape. Alternatively they may be the \nresult of the ultimate spallation of film material following the subsurface damage observed in Figure 6.8. \nThe lack of a clearly raised rim for these holes may indicate that they have been generated by slow \nparticles and irregularity may result from stress relief in the film. Figure 6.9 shows aspects of all of these \nmorphologies and may represent an impact at the boundary between different hole types. Figure 6.10 is a \nstereo image of an elliptical hole at the interface between the open area of a channel and the interchannel \nweb. No experimental data exists on the impact effects on thin films or on the nanometre scale. It is \npossible that impact effects on the nanometer scale are significantly different from those on larger scales \nand so accurate determination of particle properties and discrimination between hypervelocity and slow \nimpacts is not possible.  \n \n \nFigure 6.7.

A stereo image of a hole at the interface between the microchannel open area and the \ninterchannel web. \n6.3.1 Particle flux \nPrevious workers have determined the size distribution of interplanetary dust particles by comparison of \nobserved hole and crater sizes in space exposed surfaces with empirical hole and crater growth \nrelationships based on experimental microparticle accelerator test data (McDonnell et al., 2001). Most of \nthe resultant data available to date indicate a minimum interplanetary dust particle diameter dp ~ 0.1 \u00b5m. \nThe new data presented in this chapter indicate that this roll-off may be an artefact of previously used \ndetection techniques.  \n \nFigure 6.11 shows the size distribution of holes in the MCP nanofilm with c > 0.5, obtained through \nanalysis of both SEM from FEGSEM images. The c values was selected because it was found through \ninspection that this circularity could be used to select morphologies of interest. A roll off in the \npopulation is observed towards the resolution limit of each imaging technique. The fluxes are calculated \nfrom the hole number density by assuming an isotropic distribution of particles throughout the exposure. \nIf the observed holes are the result of a single event, such as secondaries resulting from a larger impact \nelsewhere on the ISS or particles ejected during progress docking procedures, then the calculated flux \nvalues are no longer valid but the hole size distribution remains so. \n 104\n \nFigure 6.11. Impactor flux density as a function of hole diameter Dh measured with the SEM and with the \nFEGSEM (circularity > 0.5).Also shown are statistical errors in the data.  \n \nThe Carey-McDonnell- Dixon (CMD) formula (Carey et al., 1985) can be used to relate the diameter of \nan impacting particle to the diameter of the resulting hole for foils with microscopic thicknesses but can \nbe extrapolated to the nanometre size regime to give an indication of the size of impacting particles. \nWhere Dh is hole diameter, dp is particle diameter v is the velocity in km s-1, f is the foil thickness, \u03c1t is the \ndensity of the foil material and \u03c1p is the density of the particle the CMD equation is expressed as \n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a5\u23a5\n\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a2\u23a2\n\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b+\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b+=\n\u2212n\nV\npp\nt\nV\npp\nt\np\nh\nd\nfd\nf\nd\nD\n2\n3.0\n6.0\n9.21\n19.21\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03c1\n\u03c1\n,           (6.2) \nwhere  n is given by \n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2265\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212<<= \u2212\n\u2212\n02.1:20\n)20(003.0)9.0exp(402.1:202\n1\n9.01\nskm\nskm\nn\nV\nVVV\n.                    (6.3) \nThe particle size as a function of hole diameter in a 60 nm Al film for different particle velocities and \nassuming a particle density of 1 g cm-3 is shown in Figure 6.12 determined from the CMD equation. \nTypical space debris velocities are < 10 km s-1, while dust particles can have velocities of 10s of km s-1. \n 105\n \nFigure 6.12. Particle diameter dp as a function of hole diameter Dh in a 60 nm Al film calculated from the \nCMD equation, for different impact velocities and assuming a particle density of 1 g cm-3. Values in the \nlegend are velocities in km s-1. \n \nFor Dh = 0.4 \u00b5m (the smallest hole size observed with the SEM) in a 60 nm thick aluminium film, and \nadopting an impacting particle density of 1g cm-3, the CMD formula indicates a particle diameter dp = 100 \nnm at 5 km s-1 or dp = 35 nm at 20 km s-1 impact velocity. At 100 nm the CMD equation predicts particle \ndiameters of 33 nm and 13 nm for these velocities.  These values represent typical velocities for space \ndebris and IDP populations. The CMD equation has severe limitations near to the ballistic limit and it \nmay again be unjustified to extrapolate this empirical formula to the nanometer scale but it is used here to \ngive a first order approximation to dp. \n \nOther hole growth equations exist (Gardner et al., 1997; Maiden et al., 1963; Sawle, 1969; Nysmith and \nDenardo, 1969) of which only that of Gardner et al. (often referred to as the GMC equation) and the \nCMD equation attempt to characterise hole growth near marginal impacts. Of these two equations the \nGMC equation is more reliable close to the ballistic limit but its particle density dependence is scaled to \ndata from Horz et al. (1994) for hole growth in 3000 \u2013 10000 \u00b5m foils. The GMC equation is therefore \nextrapolated here to the nanometer scale. \n \nThe cumulative flux of holes in the nanofilm was calculated to be 35 m-2 s-1. From McDonnell et al. \n(2001) the spatial density n of particles, assuming an isotropic and homogeneous incident flux is given by \nn=4F\/v, which, assuming a mean velocity of 20 km s-1, gives a spatial density of 7x10-3  m-3 for particles \nwith diameters greater than ~25 nm in the ISS environment. This compares with a previously determined \nspatial density of particles with diameters >10 \u00b5m in the ISS orbit of ~1x10-8  m-3 (Liou et al., 2002). This \ncalculation provides an order of magnitude estimate for the number density of an impactor population and \ndoes not account for the geometry of the surrounding space station structure or any directional bias \nassociated with a dust or debris population. Figure 6.13 shows the measured cumulative flux of holes in \nthe exposed nanofilm along with the hole fluxes in foils of different thicknesses on the MicroAbrasion \nPackage (MAP) experiment carried on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) (McDonnell and \n 106\nStevenson., 1991). The LDEF spacecraft carried 57 separate experiments to investigate the near Earth \nspace environment. It had a near cylindrical structure and was deployed by the Space Shuttle Challenger \nin 1984. LDEF\u2019s equatorial orbit and attitude were such that the same spacecraft faces maintained the \nsame pointing vectors relative to the orbital plane (i.e. space\/zenith, nadir, North, South, East and West). \nAfter 5.7 years in orbit LDEF was retrieved and the various surfaces and experiments were examined and \nform the basis of much of our current understanding of the near Earth interplanetary dust environment \n(McDonnell et al., 1993). There is an almost two order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over the \nLDEF foils.  The trend line is a power law continuation of the North, South and Space MAP data, which \nare likely to be the best approximation to the exposed film\u2019s pointing history.  \n \nFigure 6.13. Comparison of cumulative hole flux data from MAP (McDonnell and Stevenson, 1991) and \nthe filmed MCP exposed on the ISS. The trend line is a power law determined from the North, South and \nSpace surfaces of LDEF and the nanofilm. \n \nMeasurements of impacts on returned spacecraft surfaces and theoretical models of the natural meteoroid \nbackground and debris populations have been combined to produce ESA\u2019s Micrometeoroid And Space \ndebris Terrestrial Reference model MASTER. MASTER provides predictions of fluxes of impactors on \nspacecraft in different orbits as a function of particle properties and populations. The smallest particles \nwhich can be modelled by MASTER are 1\u00b5m in diameter. The most recent version of this model, \nMASTER 2005 (Oswald et al., 2005), has been used here to model the micrometeoroid and debris fluxes \non a flat plate on the ISS with a pointing direction identical to that of the returned MCP samples. The ISS \norbit is modelled with a semi major axis of 6725.65 km, an eccentricity of 9x10-4, an inclination of 51.6\u00b0, \na right ascension of ascending node of 199.76\u00b0 and an argument of perigee of 274.3\u00b0. The pointing \ndirection of the samples is 40.5 degrees to the right of wake for an LVLH attitude (the negative x-axis in \nthe ISS coordinate system). Although the intended attitude for the ISS is LVLH during construction and \nfor the majority of the exposure period the ISS has flown in an attitude in which the x-axis is \nperpendicular to the orbital plane (X-POP). In X-POP attitude the negative ISS x-axis always has a \n 107\n 108\ndirection which has a positive solar component so that power generation by the solar panels is optimised \nthroughout orbit without them being moved. MASTER 2005 is not able to recreate an X-POP pointing \nhistory and so the pointing history of the samples is approximated by assuming a solar orientated attitude \nwhere the negative x-axis is always Sun pointing and the samples have a pointing direction of 40.5\u00b0 right \nascension (RA) and 0\u00b0 declination (Dec) in a coordinate system where the Sun has coordinates RA = 0\u00b0, \nDec = 0\u00b0. \n \nThe diameters, masses and velocities of the particles incident on the thin films cannot be accurately \ninferred from the observed impact damage at present and so a direct comparison with existing particle \ndiameter and mass distributions may not be justified. A new feature in MASTER 2005 however is the \napplication of Equation 6.1 to determine the ballistic limit Fmax for each impacting particle as a function of \nits mass diameter and velocity. This allows the cumulative flux of holes as a function of foil thickness to \nbe predicted for the MCP sample\u2019s exposure history using a MASTER 2005 simulation. This prediction \ncan be compared with the cumulative flux of particles observed in the 60 nm film. This comparison is \nshown in Figure 6.14. \n \n \nFigure 6.14. Cumulative flux of holes in aluminium foils of varying thicknesses for surfaces in an ISS \norbit and with equivalent pointing direction to that of the MCP films during the exposure as predicted by \nthe MASTER 2005 model of space debris and natural meteoroid fluxes. Also plotted is the cumulative flux \nof particles measured on the MCP nanofilm. \n \nFmax values are shown for Fmax > 10 \u00b5m. Because the MASTER 2005 population is for particles larger \nthan 1 \u00b5m Fmax values close to this value will be unreliable. The MASTER 2005 population rolls off at \nFmax values below 0.1 mm. The roll off may be an artefact in the data from which MASTER 2005 is \nderived. For the hole size distribution shown in Figure 6.11 there is a role off towards the limit of each \nanalysis technique.  A role off is observed to occur for particles smaller than ~1 \u00b5m because the force \ndominating particles in this size regime is radiation pressure and particles can be removed from orbit. For \nparticles approaching the nanometre scale however the Lorenz force dominates and so the dynamics will \nbe significantly different. It may therefore be the case that a dense population of particles in this size \nregime exisits in near Earth space despite the observed roll off in density of the sub micron population. If \nthe general trend in the data before the roll off is continued to an Fmax value of 60 nm then the seemingly \nvery large cumulative flux of 1.1x109 m-2 yr in the nanofilm is compatible with the increased sensitivity of \nthe thin films to small particle impacts.   \n \nThe separate populations of particles with Fmax > 10 \u00b5m can be separated to reveal their relative \ncontributions. Figure 6.15 shows the relative contributions by natural micrometeoroids and space debris \ncalculated using MASTER 2005. The population is dominated by the natural population. If the data point \nprovided by the nanofilms is a true extrapolation of the general trend to the nanometre scale then this flux \nmeasurement may be dominated by a new population of nanometre scale natural dust particles. \n \n \nFigure 6.15. Contributions by the natural micrometeoroid and orbital debris populations, to the  \nMASTER 2005  cumulative  flux, as a function of Fmax predicted for the MCP samples. \n6.4 Particle incident directions \n 109\nThe flux of particles on the ISS will in general be homogeneous across the sky with an enhancement \ntowards the ram direction and a reduced flux in the wake direction. Shadowing by the Earth will produce \nzero flux from directions intercepted by the Earth. The particle flux as a function of elevation and \nazimuth, with respect to the ISS velocity vector and local horizontal plane, for particles with diameters \ngreater than 1\u00b5m impacting on a random tumbling plate in the ISS orbit, calculated using MASTER 2005 \nis shown in Figure 6.16. The figure shows zero flux in Earth pointing directions and a general flux \nenhancement towards the ram direction. Directions with very high flux densities correspond with debris \nfluxes related to specific orbits. If the nanoparticle flux observed by the thin films retrieved from the ISS \nis an extension of the >1 \u00b5m population then the distribution of incident directions is likely to be aligned \nwith this population. \n \nFigure 6.16. Particle flux as a function of impact azimuth and elevation with respect to the local velocity \nvector and horizontal planes. \n \nThe morphologies of impact holes in thin foils can be used to infer the incident directions of particles. For \na perfectly spherical particle with a diameter dp > 10f at grazing incidence on a thin foil the aspect ratio of \nthe major axis L and minor axis D of the elliptical hole produced following an impact will be related to \nthe incident angle \u03c6, measured from the normal to the surface, by the relation \u03c6cos\/ =LD  (McDonnell \nand Gardner, 1998). This relationship cannot account for irregular morphologies which are believed to be \nproduced by irregularly shaped particles which punch out their cross sections from the foils.  \n \nAn arbitrary number of 174 images of randomly selected holes were analysed using imagej. For each hole \nthe circularity and area were calculated. For holes with c > 0.5 a best fit ellipse was generated to match \nthe hole morphology. The ratio of major and minor axes of each ellipse was then used to infer an incident \nangle for the particles. Figure 6.17 shows the incident particle flux, scaled to a peak value of 1, as a \nfunction of inferred incident angle. Also shown is the scaled particle flux as a function of incident angle \nfor natural, debris and total populations calculated by MASTER 2005 for the population with dp > 1 \u00b5m. \nThe peak in the observed nanoscale population corresponds with the peak in the modelled natural \npopulation but has a much narrower angular distribution. The general angular distribution more generally \napproximates that of the debris flux neglecting the most significant debris peak between ~22-38\u00b0. The \nmajor contributions to the debris population are Solid Rocket Motor dust and ejecta. \n 110\n \nFigure 6.17. Flux scaled to a peak value of 1 as a function of off-axis angle inferred for the ISS exposed \nfilm and calculated for a surface, with a pointing history approximating that of the films, for natural and \ndebris particle populations. \n \nFrom the major axis of a hole\u2019s best fit ellipse two possible azimuthal angles of incidence in the plane of \nthe surface and parallel to the ellipse major axis, can be inferred. The angle of incidence \u03c6 and the \nazimuthal angle \u03b8 can then be combined to infer an incident direction. Figure 6.18 shows the incident \ndirection inferred for particles, which generated those holes in the sample of 174 whose circularities were \ngreater than 0.5, plotted over a hemispherical view of the ISS as seen from the samples. The data is \nshown in Figure 6.18a and b for a hole threshold of Dh > 0.4 \u00b5m and in c and d for all particles. Figure \n6.18a and c show all of the incident directions that can be inferred from the ellipses taking both possible \nazimuthal values. Figure 6.18b and d show the directions selected such that they can be attributed either \nto the ISS structure or to the negative x-axis of the ISS. \n 111\n \nFigure 6.18. Inferred incident direction of the impacting particles on the nanofilms shown over a \nhemispherical view of the ISS as seen from the samples (hemispherical view used courtesy of Boeing). In \na and b a hole diameter threshold of 0.4 \u00b5m is applied and c and d all hole diameters are used. In a and c \nallpossible directions are shown (i.e. all particles are shown twice). In b and d directions are selected to \ncoincide with significant directions with respect to the space station structure. The space station modules \nin the figure point along the negative x-axis of the space station. \n \nThe close alignment of the population with both the ISS structure and the negative x axis of the ISS \nstrongly indicate that the particle population which produced the impacts in the film is local to the ISS. \nThose particles associated with the structure are most likely to be secondary ejecta particles following \nlarger impacts on the ISS. The rear of the Zvezda module on the ISS at the extreme of the ISS  negative x \naxis is the docking location for the Progress capsule. Particles released during thruster firings by Progress \nduring docking manoeuvres are therefore the most likely source of these holes. Aluminium surfaces from \nthe Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX) show impact craters produced by high-\nspeed propellant droplet impacts with dp values ranging from 1-20 \u00b5m (Soares et al., 2002). Such a \nmechanism may be the source of some of the holes observed in the filmed MCPs.  \n \nThis incident direction indicated will also be close to the mean solar direction observed by the particles \nover the two year exposure in an X-POP attitude. It is possible that beta meteoroids, meteoroids \naccelerated on hyperbolic orbits out of the solar system by radiation pressure (Whipple, 1976; Wehry and \nMann, 1999) are the cause of this directionality given the direction relation to the solar direction, although \nbeta meteoroids have a minimum possible diameter of ~100 \u00b5m. Natural particles with diameters smaller \nthan ~100 nm will be charged in the space environment, will have trajectories dominated by the Lorenz \n 112\n 113\nforce and will interact with the Earth\u2019s electromagnetic field. A review of the dynamics of charged dust \nparticles in the solar system is given by Horyani (1996). The observed directionality may also be an \nartefact of the technique used to infer direction, which has not been calibrated.  \n6.5 Impactor residues \nThe analysis of residues left on foils by impactors is another useful tool for the separation and \nidentification of debris and dust populations. Studies of impactor residues have been carried out \nextensively on returned space-exposed surfaces using EDXS and SIMS.  \n \nDifficulties arise in residue identification around impact features in filmed MCPs owing to the complex \ncomposition of the underlying MCP glass (Chapter 2), which includes most elements of interest for \nimpact studies. X-ray spectra from the impacted aluminium film also contain a contribution from the \nglass within the walls of the underlying microchannel as the high electron-accelerating voltages required \nto excite elements of interest cause electrons to penetrate the film and excite fluorescence from the glass \nbelow. Analyses carried out on retrieved solar cells from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have \ndemonstrated that impactor residues can be identified on complex substrates (Kearsley et al., 2005). By \ncomparing spectra from locations on a sample, with and without impact features, and with an equivalent \ngeometry with respect to the X-ray detector, changes in the peak heights of key elements can be \ninterpreted as evidence for the presence of residues. Such an approach removes the geometrical effects, \nshown in Chapter 2 to be important for EDXS analysis on the microchannel scale. High resolution \nelemental mapping is also available as a standard EDXS technique and can be a valuable tool in the \nobservation and identification of impact residues. \n \nA study has been carried out using the SEM at the Natural History Museum in London to identify \npossible residues in the Al film using EDXS and elemental mapping. If the observed impact features are \nlargely generated by particles with diameters of 10s of nanometers then residues will be small. Despite \nthis some potential impact residues have been observed.  \n \n \nFigure 6.19. Backscattered electron image of an impact hole and potential Al residue. Spectra were taken \nfrom the sites shown. The residue and background spectra are compared in Figure 6.20. \n \nAt accelerating voltages >20 kV and using backscattered electron (BSE) imaging, faint outlines of some \nholes in the film have been resolved and around three of these holes apparent residues have been \nobserved. Backscattered electrons are detected after ~180\u00b0 deflections following impacts with atoms in \nthe sample under analysis and BSE imaging is well suited to finding residues and localised contaminants \nas it is highly sensitive to variations in atomic number. A backscattered electron image of one of these \nimpact sites is shown in Figure 6.19. Two spectra were taken from the region around the hole from a \nsimilar area within the same microchannel using an electron beam energy of 20 keV. The spectra from \nboth sites are compared in Figure 6.20 after normalisation to the Si-K peak. \n \nOver the apparent residue there was an excess of aluminium when compared with the background region \nof film. Other elements observed are consistent with the background spectrum. Elemental mapping also \nshows an excess of aluminium in the residue. Figure 6.21 shows a map of Al-K X-rays from the area \nsurrounding the impact feature shown in the BSE image of Figure 6.19. The background contribution \nfrom the microchannel walls and Al-K X-rays from the overlying film are observed with a high density of \nAl-K X-rays from the residue. Similar maps for other elemental lines show no significant structure related \nto the residue. \n \n 114\n \nFigure 6.20. Comparison of the residue and background spectra of Figure 6.16 showing an aluminium \nexcess in the region around the impact site. \n \nAluminium residues are generally associated with impacts by oxidised aluminium spherules with \ndiameters of ~1 \u00b5m, which are used in solid rocket motors (Cofer at al., 1989). It can therefore be \nspeculated that aluminium spherules may be responsible for the few impact sites observed to have \nresidues like the one described. It is perhaps more likely that the observation of Al excess has resulted \nfrom material vaporised from the film during impact and then re-deposited or which has remained around \nthe impact site on the underside of the film. Al residues in other space exposed surfaces such as HST \nretrieved arrays (Kearsley et al., 2005) have been found to contain variable and often very minor \nquantities of oxygen. It is believed that this variation arises from the variable combustion of the Al \nparticles in solid rocket motor exhaust (H\u00f6rz et al., 2002).  \n \nGiven the rarity of these residues in comparison with the overall number of holes (estimated to be <0.1% \nof the total sample) they cannot be considered representative of the wider population of impact features. \nThese results do, however, indicate that residues of impacting particles may be detectable. Attempts to \ndetect smaller residues by using longer integration times of hours to days have not been successful. SIMS \nis a more sensitive, but destructive, technique for residue analysis. A programme of sample analysis using \na SIMS Attachment to a Focussed Ion Beam (FIB) at Imperial college, London is underway and is likely \nto allow a more detailed compositional analysis and detection of any residues present to provide insight \ninto the impactors\u2019 origins.  \n 115\n \nFigure 6.21. Al-K X-ray line elemental map of the region around the impact site imaged in Figure 6.19 \nshowing a large excess of aluminium in the residue. \n \n6.6 Future nanofilm exposure experiments \nThis experiment has demonstrated filmed MCPs as passive detectors of interplanetary dust and space \ndebris with unprecedented sensitivity. Analysis of impact holes in the films has revealed a previously \nunobservable nanometre scale particle population in the ISS environment, though the precise origins of \nthis population have not yet been established. A future exposure, optimised for particle detection, would \nbest allow the identification of the particulate populations as either micrometeoroids from interplanetary \nspace or sub-micron space debris. Such an experiment may use films of differing thicknesses and pointing \ndirections in a manner similar to the MAP experiment on LDEF. MCP films can be manufactured with \nthicknesses as small as 40 nm (Fairbend, 2005). An experiment consisting of a number of detectors with \ndifferent film thickness and the same pointing characteristics would provide valuable insight into the \nballistic limits of the impactors and place limits on the properties of observed particles. It may be that the \nexposed film surfaces need not be large; analysis of the ISS exposed films indicates approximately 3 \nimpacts per minute for each 1 cm2 surface area. It may be however that the high spatial density of holes is \nin fact the result of single events such as docking procedures or secondary ejecta from large impacts \nelsewhere on the ISS. If this is the case then much larger areas may be required to ensure detection of \nnanometre scale natural dust particles.  \n \nThis technique relies on the return of samples from orbit and is therefore limited to exposure on manned \nspacecraft in LEO and sample return missions. No time resolution or directional information is available \nand the analysis of impact sites requires detailed post-flight investigation. The addition of an active \nelement to provide information on time and position of impacts would be a major advantage for any \nfuture exposure. Clusters of events with small or zero time separations, likely to result from secondary \nimpacts, can then be identified and holes can be correlated with the pointing direction of the surface at \ntime of impact. Temporal and directional information allows the separation of debris impacts (which are \n 116\noften clustered and dominated can be highly directional) and interplanetary dust populations. An ideal \nexperiment would use multiple detectors with multiple pointing directions, whose fields of view were \nunobscurred by structures that may provide a source of secondary particles. An active detector would also \nbe suitable for use on missions where the experiment is not returned allowing the large cost of retrieval to \nbe removed and extending the measurement technique to unmanned missions in both near Earth and deep \nspace orbits. Nanometer-scale dust populations could then be detected throughout the solar system.  \n \nOne possible active readout solution uses the transmission of light by impact holes in the film. The high \nreflectivity of the undamaged Al film significantly reduces the transmission of radiation from an external \nlight source, such as an LED, onto a position sensitive detector on the non-filmed side of the MCP. \nPhotons passing through holes will produce a localised increase in illumination on the detector. The \nchange in intensity is a function of the hole size, which is in turn a function of impactor cross-section, \ndensity and velocity. A possible arrangement for such a detector is shown in Figure 6.22. The high flux \nobtainable in the small particle size regime allows for a very small detector area. If larger areas are \nrequired then multiple detectors can be employed. \n \n \nFigure 6.22. Possible format of an active MCP nanofilm detector. The total light flux incident on the \nfront face of the film Io is equal to the sum of the reflected and transmitted fluxes Ir and It. \nThe photon intensity under a single microchannel after the generation of a hole (It2) as a fraction of the \npre-impact intensity (It1) is given by \nchannel\nholechannelhole\nt\nt\nAR\nAARA\nI\nI\n)1(\n))(1(\n1\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212+= ,                        (6.4) \nWhere Ahole is the area of the generated hole, Achannel of the microchannel, and R is the reflectivity of the \nmicrochannel at the selected wavelength. This equation assumes that the wavelength selected is \nsufficiently small that it can be transmitted unimpeded through the hole generated. A disadvantage of the \ntechnique is that the smallest hole resolvable is defined by the wavelength of light selected as photons \nwith wavelengths greater than the hole diameter will not be transmitted. \n \n 117\n 118\nAnother disadvantage of this technique is that detecting the generation of a hole does not directly yield \ninformation on the velocity or mass of a particle. If hole sizes can be determined from the signal increase \nthen impactor properties can only be determined by comparison with simulations of impacts and \nmicroparticle accelerator experiments yet to be carried out. \n \nAn alternative solution may be to observe the impact flash generated as a hypervelocity impact occurs. \nThe light flash from impacts on solid targets has been utilised for dust detection on sounding rocket \nexperiments (Berg and Meridith, 1956) and on the VeGa 1 and 2 and Giotto Spacecraft (Kissel, 1986). \nThe advantage of light flash detection is that the maximum light intensity and total light energy are both \nunique functions of the impactor mass and velocity (Friichtenicht, 1965, Gehring et al., 1966, Rollins and \nJean, 1968, Eichhorn, 1976, Burchell et al., 1996) and the rise time of the impact flash is a function of \nvelocity (Eichhorn, 1975). Light flash observations therefore have the potential to provide detailed \ninformation on particle properties and the lower detection limit is defined by the photon counting ability \nof the detector and not by the wavelength. In addition the flash, which lasts for approximately 100 \u00b5s, can \nbe time resolved into two parts; the first of which results from the primary impact and the second results \nfrom impacts by secondary particles. The determined relationships have been for particles incident on \nsemi infinite surfaces where complete annihilation has occurred and not for thin film or foil impacts \nwhere the output may be significantly reduced as complete annihilation of the impactor may not occur. In \naddition it is the flash component on the rear side of the film which is observed in this case; a component \nwhich has not been measured before.  \n6.6.1 Selection of operating waveband  \nThe reflectivity of the film, the size of the impact holes and the detector quantum efficiency will define \nsuitable wavebands for operation of the detector system. Aluminium has high reflectivity across the \ninfrared-visible-ultraviolet range (Bennett et al., 1962) but reflectivity measurements of Al films on \nMCPs have not been made before. The reflectivity of a non exposed Al film on an MCP, identical to \nthose flown, was measured with a Perkin Elmer Lambda series UV-VIS spectrometer using an RSA-PE-\n20 accessory to provide the optical geometry illustrated in Figure 6.23. The Integrating sphere allows the \nsimultaneous measurement of both specular and diffuse reflection.  \n \nThe measured reflectivity, from infrared to ultra-violet wavelengths, of a 60 nm Al film on an MCP \nsimilar to that exposed on the ISS is shown in Figure 6.24. The reflectivity of the Al film is determined by \ncomparison with a standard sample of known reflectivity. \n \n \nFigure 6.23. Optical setup of the reflectivity measurements provided by a RSA-PE-20 accessory. M1, M2 \nand M3 are flat mirrors and the beam is transmitted onto the sample through apertures in the \ntransmittance port and integrating sphere. The sample beam is incident on the sample at an angle of 8\u00b0 to \nthe normal and is provided by a Perkin Elmer Lambda series UV-VIS spectrometer, which also measures \nthe integrated reflected signal. \n \nFigure 6.24 shows a high reflectivity across all wavelengths, but the narrow peak at 694 nm has not been \nobserved in data from standard Al films published by previous workers (Bennett et al., 1962). Although \nthe sample intervals used in previous studies were sufficiently large that such a narrow peak may not have \nbeen observed, it is possible that the peak is an artefact of the measurement technique employed here. The \npeak has also been observed by this technique for measurements made of Al films evaporated onto glass \nslides but not for other metal films or a highly polished thick Al mirror, although structure in the \nreflectivity profile is seen in this last case. Similar peak shapes are observed as a result of surface plasmon \nresonance (SPR) (e.g. Bussjager and Macleod, 1995) but using different measurement techniques and \nillumination geometries. SPR is a phenomenon associated with thin films and at very specific \nwavelengths and incident angles, and via media with a refractive index of less than 1 (e.g. glass). \nAlthough SPR usually manifests as a minimum in reflectivity it can manifest as a peak under very \nspecific conditions.  SPR may be the origin of the observed peak in Al reflectivity although the \nprobability that the described measurements were made under conditions appropriate to the production of \nan SPR peak is small. Further investigation is required to identify the origin of the peak and the \npossibility of SPR. \n \n 119\n \nFigure 6.24. Measured IR-UV reflectivity for a 60 nm Al film on an MCP identical to the ISS exposed \nsamples. \n \nThe minimum hole diameter resolvable by the detector is defined by the wavelength of the light, which is \nselected to provide a high ratio It2\/It1. The peak at 694 nm must be regarded as anomalous until further \ninvestigations can establish its true nature. The illuminating wavelength must also be less than the size of \nthe holes under observation. Photons with wavelengths longer than the hole diameter will not be \ntransmitted. Transmission of light with wavelength \u03bb through apertures with diameter D < \u03bb has been \nobserved and even amplified through arrays of apertures using SPR to enhance the transmission (Ghaemi \net al., 1998) but is a technique unlikely to be of use here given the specific wavelength and angle \nrequirements.  \n \nA trade off must be made between reflectivity, the minimum resolvable hole size and the quantum \nefficiency of the readout detector. Assuming an operating wavelength of 300 nm and adopting the \nreflectivity of Figure 6.24 the value It1\/It2 as a function of hole diameter (Dh) from Equation 6.14, \nassuming circular holes and neglecting diffraction limitations is shown in Figure 6.25.  \n \n 120\n \nFigure 6.25. The fractional change (It1\/It2) photon intensity under a single 12.5 \u00b5m diameter filmed \nmicrochannel after the generation of a hole as a function of hole diameter Dh calculated from Equation \n6.4 and assuming circular holes. \n \nIf impact flashes are to be detected then the detection waveband should coincide with the peak in \nemission of the incident particles. Temperatures associated with hypervelocity impacts are generally in \nthe region of 2500 K to 5000 K, determined from experimental studies with particle accelerators \n(Eichhorn, 1976) by assuming that the light emissions was that of a black body radiation curve, which \nwas found to peak between 150 and 300 nm. Eichhorn (1975) was able to establish cratering \ncharacteristics by observation of the light emission between 300 and 700 nm. A light detector will require \nhigh quantum efficiency at these wavelengths. The precise relationships between velocity, mass and light \nemission will need to be investigated for the specific size regime and detector properties of the instrument \ndescribed here to allow detailed information on impact properties to be determined. The rise times for \nthese peaks are velocity dependent and are typically between 10 \u00b5s and 100 \u00b5s (Eichhorn, 1976). The \nprecise origin of the light flash is believed to result from emissions by a jet of shocked material initiated \nfrom either the target or the particle depending on the shock properties of these materials and the particle \nvelocity (Ang, 1990).  \n6.6.2 Optical arrangement \nDirect contact of the detector with the back of the MCP is one possible arrangement (Figure 6.22). The \nparticles under observation have previously been undetectable and are therefore unlikely to pose a \nsignificant damage risk to pixels. The collimating MCP limits the maximum angle of incidence for \nparticles impacting directly on the detector to 0.6\u00b0 following perforation of the film (for a standard \nL\/D=120 MCP), although secondary particles from the film and microchannel walls will be incident on \nthe detector. Particles at grazing incidence to the channel walls may also be deflected in a direction \nparallel to the walls as has been found to occur for grazing incidence X-ray optics (Meidinger et al., \n 121\n 122\n2003). Variability in secondary impacts following the initial impact with the film may lead to \nmeasurement uncertainties.  \n \nThe MCP walls also provide an optical advantage; radiation incident on the walls will, in general, be \nreflected back into the MCP, ensuring a concentration of flux over the area directly under a given \nmicrochannel. Losses at the channel wall are likely to be small. Internal reflection within the channels can \nbe increased by coating the inside surface of a microchannel with a reflective metal coating similar to \nthose used for X-ray optics and described in Chapters 4 and 5 to create an integrating cylinder.  \n6.6.3 Selection of detector \nOne readout option for the active nanodust detector may be a CMOS active pixel detector, which is \navailable off the shelf at low cost. CMOS detectors also have good radiation hardness compared with \nCCDs (Hopkinson, 2000) and are therefore well suited to applications in space. Permanent effects on \nsingle pixels are introduced by atom displacement by incident radiation but the readout mechanism does \nnot require pixel transfer, as is the case for CCDs, and so single damaged pixels can be isolated. Pixels \nwith diameters similar to those of the MCP microchannels will allow detection of localised light intensity \nchanges. In addition such pixellated detectors can provide good time resolution allowing the identification \nof pointing direction and multiple events resulting from dust or debris clouds. A disadvantage with \nCMOS sensors is the high noise typical in signals which may prevent accurate identification of small \nsignal changes. \n \nA candidate device is the Fill Factory STAR1000, which is designed for use in the space environment. \nThe STAR1000 has 15 \u00b5m\u00d715 \u00b5m pixels, which approximate the diameter of a conventional MCP, and a \npeak quantum efficiency of 30 % at 600 nm falling to ~10% at 400 nm (Star1000 data sheet, Fill Factory, \nMechelen, Belgium).   \n \nAlternatively a CCD detector may be used although such detectors will require cooling and are highly \nsusceptible to radiation damage. Displacement of atoms in the Si lattice by incident radiation can create \npotential wells within pixels in which charge, transferred through that pixel can be trapped (Janesick et \nal., 1989). Although CCD\u2019s in general have a poor UV quantum efficiency (<10 % below 300 nm) they \ncan be coated with high refractive index dielectrics to reduce the UV reflectivity of the pixel surfaces and \nthus optimise their UV performance. QE as high as 75 % can be achieved at 250 nm (CCD47 data sheet, \nE2V Technologies, Chelmsford, UK). Low QE is not an important factor here however as the intensity of \nthe illuminating LED can be increased to compensate for a poor detector response. By running a CCD in \nframe transfer mode, where each frame is integrated and read out as an image, and subtracting the \nprevious frame from each preceding frame, changes in signal will be detected.  \n \nIf a UV light flash is to be detected then in a frame transfer mode the integrated energy of the flash will \nbe recorded and read out from the area underneath the impacted microchannel. If run in \u201cphotodiode\u201d or \n 123\n\u201ctime resolving\u201d mode (Abbey, 2005), where pixels are continuously transferred and all spatial resolution \nis lost, then a time resolution for an isolated event on the detector area of 10-20 \u00b5s can be achieved \nproviding ~15 flash measurements during an impact event. This mode has a power requirement of ~10-\n100 mW compared with a power requirement for frame transfer mode of <1 mW.  \n \n6.7 Discussion and conclusions \nThe detection of dust and debris particles in space by a filmed MCP has been demonstrated by in-situ \nmeasurements of the ISS environment. The particle diameter detection limit of the 60 nm Al films, \ncalculated by extrapolation of empirical formulae for the perforation limit of aluminium foils, is \napproximately 15-20 nm for particles with velocities typical for interplanetary dust particles, more than an \norder of magnitude smaller than for previous experiments. The particle fluxes, inferred from \nmeasurements of the spatial density of holes, are consistent with the extrapolation of existing data and \nmodels to this new size regime. \n \nAs with most evaporated films, it is likely that our MCP films are highly stressed (Fairbend, 2005) and \nwill have a crystalline structure with a scale comparable with the diameters of particles at the ballistic \nlimit. In addition, any oxidised surface layer will have a significant effect on the mechanical properties of \nthe film, which are poorly understood. Hence the response of our films to impacts may differ substantially \nfrom the response measured in studies of thicker aluminium foils. It cannot be assumed, therefore, that the \nexisting equations connecting Dh and dp apply in the case of the current thin film samples, though the \nformulae so developed were from hypervelocity impacts in a wide range of foils with thicknesses from 10 \n\u00b5m to 100 nm and dimensional scaling, albeit weak, was incorporated into the expressions (McDonnell, \n2005). A programme of research will be required to verify the relationships and perhaps develop new \nrelationships connecting particle diameter dp, particle density \u03c1p, target density \u03c1t, velocity v and hole \ndiameter Dh for these much thinner films. \n \nThere is a strong possibility that impactor species other than naturally occurring interplanetary dust may \nhave contributed to the observed hole distributions. The observed impacts may result from secondary \nejecta from larger impacts elsewhere on the ISS; such enhancements have been previously reported \n(Mandeville et al., 1999; Rival et al., 1999), though there is little evidence of damage from the much \nlarger particles that would also be the product of such events. Ejecta need not come from surfaces in the \nline of sight; particles with dp < 1\u00b5m can have orbital lifetimes of the order of a day, whilst particles with \ndp < 10 \u00b5m can have lifetimes of around one year, and so secondary particles can impact with non line-of-\nsite surfaces after several ISS orbits (Mandeville et al., 1999). The spatial density of ejecta in the ISS orbit \nis expected to be ~10-13 m-3 for dp = 10 \u00b5m particulates and ~10-12 m-3 for those with dp = 1 \u00b5m (Bariteuax \nand Mandeville, 2002). The domination of space debris over the interplanetary dust population at size \nregimes dp < 10 \u00b5m (McDonnell et al., 2001) suggests that our observed holes may be generated by \ndebris. The fluxes of these particles have been measured in LEO by experiments incorporating a range of \n 124\nfoil thicknesses on a variety of spacecraft (McDonnell et al. 1996). The measured fluxes are orders of \nmagnitude less than that described here and are for particles with dp > 1 \u00b5m. More recent measurements \nof impactor fluxes by the active detector DEBIE on the Belgian led PROBA mission (Schwanethal and \nMcBride, 2004) have recorded fluxes of between 5.6x10-4 m-2 s-1 and 6.5x10-4 m-2 s-1 for particles with dp > \n1.9 \u00b5m; a factor of 104 less than that experienced by the MCP nanofilm.  \n \nIf the impact holes in the thin aluminium film result from man-made debris, then this debris must be from \neither a high density population of particles with diameters sufficiently small that they have been \nundetectable by previous experiments, or the flux of particles impacting on the sample was orders of \nmagnitude higher than that detected for previous experiments in similar orbits and on the ISS.  \n \nGeneration of the observed, high circularity, holes by processes other than impact is unlikely. Vibrations \nand acoustic stress on the films during launch of the manned Soyuz carrier will have been small. Atomic \noxygen will oxidise the film uniformly and across the entire film area, which in any event will be almost \nentirely oxidised soon after deposition on the MCP. Other sources of damage are likely to affect the wider \nsurface area, including the interchannel web, unlike the localised effects of impacts; such extended \nregions of damage are not observed, and while thermal-cycling over the ISS orbit could potentially induce \ndamage to the film, this would be expected to produce tears in the film rather than the observed holes. \nSimilar films made from carbon and supported by micromeshes have been tested extensively for space \napplications and found to survive thermal, acoustic and vibrational testing (McComas et al., 2004).  \n \nA thermal cycling test on MCP film samples has been carried out to provide further insight into film \nbehaviour. After 24 hours of cycling in nitrogen in an Environmental Design thermal cycling unit in the \nSpace Research Centre at the University of Leicester, between \u201370 \u00baC and 100 \u00baC, no damage was \nobserved on the film samples when observed with an SEM. This temperature range is not fully \nrepresentative of the in orbit temperature variations but represents the full range achievable with this \nequipment so some uncertainty remains. \n \nFuture experimental work will investigate impacts on these thin films, particularly by nanometre to \nmicrometer scale impactors. This programme may use aluminium particles with diameters of between 80 \nnm and 100 nm (provided by Qinetiq Nanomaterials Ltd, Farnborough, UK)  accelerated by the Van de \nGraaff microparticle accelerator at the Open University, Milton Keynes, UK to determine the \ncharacteristics of hypervelocity impacts on filmed MCPs. Particle size and velocity selection is not \navailable with this facility. Alternatively these particles may be fired from a light gas gun facility at the \nOpen University or the University of Kent at Canterbury, at velocities ~6 km s-1. The Van de Graaff \naccelerator at the Max Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics, Heidelberg may accelerate particles as small as \n10 nm at speeds greater than 10 km s-1, although the particles with diameters smaller than ~50 nm cannot \nbe controlled at the moment.   \n \n 125\nFurther realisation of this new technique and the discovery of this new small particle population could be \nachieved by future passive exposures and by an \u2018active\u2019 version of the detector through the addition of a \nreadout solution, able to measure and record impacts in real time. The MCP detector would then become \nsuitable for use on any platform, allowing mapping of dust distributions from spacecraft throughout the \nsolar system. It is vital to obtain measurements from outside of Low Earth Orbit. At low altitudes debris \npopulations are high and it may be that very small natural particles, which are dominated by the Lorenz \nforce will be unable to travel through the magnetosphere. \n \nReadout solutions may use optical transmission by holes in the nanofilm, resulting from particle impacts \nor the detection of the UV flash associated with the impacts. Such a detector will provide pixellated \nimpact position and time resolution, and may yield mass and velocity information. Further work needs to \nbe carried out to determine the optimal readout mechanism for an active nanoscale dust detector. \n \nWhether the high impact fluxes described here are due to natural dust or man made debris, the detection \nof nanometre scale impacts by the 60 nm aluminium film represents an order of magnitude improvement \nin the sensitivity of instrumentation designed for the detection of dust in space. \n 126\nCHAPTER 7 \n \n7 Conclusions and Further Work \n \nMicrochannel plates have been an invaluable technology for the detection of X-rays, EUV photons and \ncharged particles during four decades of space missions. More recently MCPs have been developed as X-\nray optics and may form the basis of future detectors for interplanetary dust and space debris research. \nThe preceding chapters have described developments in MCP technology as detectors, collimators, optics \nand finally cosmic dust detectors. These developments have contributed significantly to the state of the \nart, led to new applications of MCPs and opened new areas of research for scientific discovery.  \n7.1 MCP detectors for EUV  \nThe reduction in EUV quantum efficiency in modern MCPs, which has inhibited EUV astronomy since \nthe early 1990s, may be due to changes in the along-microchannel surface composition of these MCPs, \nobserved here for the first time. Along channel composition profiles have been observed through the \nnovel application of energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provided by a scanning electron microscope. \nSurface composition affects the secondary electron emission characteristics of MCP glass, which in turn \ndefines MCP QE. Compositional changes at intermediate channel depths may result in a loss of QE for \nEUV photons but not for X-rays, as the former has an increased probability of reflection at the channel \nentrance and is likely to interact with the glass at these channel depths.  \n \nVariations in glass composition are likely to result from some subtle changes in the manufacturing \nprocess. The stages in manufacture most likely to be associated with these changes are associated with \nflow of fluids in the microchannels and sol-gel processes. The mechanics of fluids along channels with \nmicroscopic dimensions are complex and can vary considerably from flows in macroscopic pipes. The \ntemperature, velocity and pressure of a fluid can vary considerably with position along the channel, and \nthe position dependencies can be affected by the properties of the fluid at the channel entrance.  A change \nin fluid properties at a given point along a channel resulting from small changes in the properties of the \nfluid entering the channel may alter the reaction rate with the channel walls and vary the surface \ncomposition producing the observed compositional variations and reducing the QE. \n \nAn experimental programme is underway to investigate MCP QE further by testing the QE of a number \nof MCPs with good electron detection efficiencies. It is reported by the manufacturer Photonis, SAS that \nsuch plates should have improved EUV QE if the reduction is due to variations in composition at depths \nof ~three channel diameters. Modelling of fluid flows along microchannels may allow the investigation of \nfluid flows as possible origins of the observed structure in along-channel composition.  \n \n 127\nThe study described in Chapter 2 has provided a way forwards towards solving the mystery of the lost QE \nand regaining historical detector performance for future applications. Such a programme of QE recovery \nis essential for EUV astronomy, a subject whose future may depend on the results of this work. \n7.2 MCP optics and collimators for planetary remote sensing \nThe Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS) on the European BepiColombo mission to Mercury \nwill detect and image solar X-ray induced fluorescent X-rays from the surface of the planet. Analysis of \nthese X-rays will provide detailed information on Mercury\u2019s surface elemental composition allowing its \nhistory and evolution to be inferred and leading to an increased understanding of the formation of the \nsolar system as a whole. MIXS will have two instrument channels, an X-ray telescope (MIXS-T), using \nan MCP Wolter optic, whose optimisation has been described in this thesis to provide sub km surface \nresolution during high solar activity, and a non-imaging slumped MCP collimator (MIXS-C), introduced \nfor the first time in Chapter 3, to provide high X-ray throughput regardless of solar state and access to X-\nray lines with energies greater than 5 keV. This two channel approach guarantees the production of global \nelemental abundance maps at ~40 km resolution regardless of solar state whilst providing an \nunprecedented surface pixel size of 200 m if solar conditions are favourable, maximising the science \nreturn. The resultant elemental maps will only reveal the composition of the surface few microns of the \nplanet but can also indicate the composition of the underlying regolith as a result of \u201cimpact gardening\u201d.  \n \nThe next few years will see the development of a laboratory programme to test and construct the \ntechnologies required for MIXS, the construction of test models of the instrument and the eventual flight \nto Mercury, beginning in 2013 with arrival at Mercury in 2017. \n \nMIXS may be followed by other similar instruments applying the same technology to investigate the \ncompositions of other bodies in the Solar System. In the outer solar system fluorescent X-ray emission \nfrom atmosphereless bodies in the Jovian and Saturnian systems is believed to result from bombardment \nby highly energetic magnetospheric ions. The power emitted in soft X-rays from Io and Europa is \nobserved to be 1.5-2 MW (Elsner et al., 2002), approximately 20 times greater than from the Moon \nwhose soft X-ray emission is 0.07 MW (Schmitt et al., 1991; Kamata et al., 1999) and so imagers similar \nto MIXS are ideal instruments for future missions to the two gas giant systems. Jupiter and Saturn \nthemselves are emitters of X-rays as a result of interactions between their ionospheres and the solar wind \n(Metzger et al., 1983), bremsstrahlung radiation (Gladstone et al., 2002), resonant scattering of solar X-\nrays and ion precipitation from the ring current (Waite et al., 1994; Maurellis et al., 2000; Gladstone et \nal., 2002; Ness et al., 2000). In addition the plasma torus around Io is also a major emitter of \nbremsstrahlung X-ray emission. The work described in this thesis will result in the realisation of an \ninstrument which will revolutionise our view of the innermost planet, advance our understanding of solar \nsystem formation and may eventually be applied to exploration of the Saturnian and Jovian systems. \n 128\n7.3 MCPs as interplanetary dust detectors \nNanometer scale aluminium films, applied to the faces of MCP optics as thermal barriers, have been \ndemonstrated as highly sensitive detectors of impacting interplanetary dust and space debris with \nsensitivities two orders of magnitude greater than previously flown detectors. An analysis of a filmed \nMCP, which was exposed to the external environment of the International Space Station has revealed a \nhigh density, and previously unobservable, nanometer scale dust population. The origins of this \npopulation are currently unclear. It may contain contributions from both natural dust and man made \ndebris. Further analysis of the samples with advanced microanalysis techniques may allow the \nidentification and isolation of natural and artificial contributions to this population through the detection \nof trace elements in impactor residues.  \n \nA programme of detector calibration using controlled impacts from particle accelerators is essential in \norder to properly quantify the impacts that have been observed. Although no accelerators available can \naccelerate or control particles close to the ballistic limit of this detector the Van De Graaff accelerator at \nthe Max Plank Institute in Heidelberg can accelerate 50 nm iron particles to high speeds and other \naccelerator facilities are working towards developing ten nanometer scale particle capabilities.  \n \nThe ISS sample exposure experiment was not optimised as a dust or debris experiment. A future \noptimised experiment would allow improved confidence in the results presented here and provide \nadditional information on nanometer dust fluxes for different environments and exposure characteristics \nsuch as pointing direction and film thickness. Passive exposure experiments are limited to manned \nvehicles in LEO, and this environment cannot be assumed to be representative of the conditions in higher \norbits and in deep space. To observe the wider dust environment it will be necessary to produce an active \nsensor with equivalent sensitivity to that demonstrated by the filmed MCPs.  \n \nA detector concept based on the transmission of light by holes in the film and the detection of the UV \nflash associated with high velocity impacts has been presented. Such a sensor could be used to map the \nnanometer scale dust populations encountered by any platform. The development of this detector requires \nlaboratory calibration of particle impacts on thin films and the associated UV flash and verification of the \nproposed readout technique using a Van de Graaff dust accelerator. Modelling of impacts on nanometer \nscales using molecular models and hydrocodes may provide additional insight into the physics of \nsubmicron impacts and thin films and a subsequent decoding of impact morphologies to determine \nproperties of the impacting particles. \n7.4 Final comments \nAfter four decades of service as detectors for space science MCPs continue to be an important \ntechnology. From their beginnings as X-ray and EUV detectors MCPs are still the detectors of choice for \nEUV astronomy and have been adapted as optics for X-ray astronomy and planetary remote sensing, \nproviding unprecedented elemental mapping resolution. MCPs have been demonstrated in this thesis as \n 129\nhighly sensitive detectors of interplanetary dust and space debris particles, for the first time, and have led \nto the discovery of a hitherto undetectable dust population in near Earth Space. Over the next forty years \nMCPs will find use as scientific detectors throughout the solar system and will continue to be a vital \ntechnology for astronomy and planetary science. \n 130\nREFERENCES \n \nAaltonen, T.
