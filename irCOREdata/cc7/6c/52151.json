Peter \nKemp and Dr John McManus MBCS were disappointed at the \ndisorganised, unstandardised and disintegrated IT landscape \nthat emerged from the move away from mainframe to \nclient\/server and web-based systems. Has anything changed?   \nWhen we first learned about the concept of enterprise architecture, it appeared \nto be just what the IT world had been waiting for but, we were \ndisappointed. Tackling a business's IT portfolio from a strategic, centralised \nperspective appeared to be the only way forward. A decade later, however, is it \ntime to reappraise the direction enterprise architecture is leading and to re-\nevaluate the benefits that it has realised?   \nOur disquiet over where enterprise architecture (EA) was taking us began in \n2004 when we were attending a presentation on enterprise security by the EA \nteam for a major government department. When it dawned on us what was \nbeing proposed we asked 'does this mean that we can make no progress on \nsecurity until everything has been rewritten in Java?' To which the stunning \nanswer came: 'we can't make progress on anything until we've rewritten \neverything in Java!' \nOn the same project, in another presentation, the legacy application estate was \ndescribed as 'the slime'. We felt very uneasy about this for a number of reasons, \nnot least that we don't share the common EA disdain for legacy systems. \nThe same year we saw the EA for another major public sector body that showed \neverything across the enterprise composed of sea of Java components. The thing \nthat struck us was that it would have been impossible to tell to which sort of \norganisation the proposed EA applied. There was simply no business-focused \nelement to it at all.  \nAs we had been working for that body for over a year, we had formed some \nideas of what an EA ought to look like and that it ought to reflect at least five \nsignificant business areas, with very different business, technical and operational \ncharacteristics: from real-time, mission-critical, safety-critical systems to \nstandard HR, Payroll and Finance systems, to public-facing informational \nwebsites. If EA was proposing that these things were all homogeneous, then \nsurely something was badly wrong. \nIn the main, we put these early observations down to the EA practitioners in \nquestion: they had not understood EA properly, at the very least from the point \nof view of proposing an EA that was practically achievable. But, we have to say, \nthat were not sure we've yet seen an EA strategy that is anything other than \nimpractical, unachievable and, even if it could be achieved, unsustainable. Yet, \nEA seemed to have gained ground as a hugely beneficial concept and has \nperhaps reached an apotheosis in the much debated NPfIT (National Programme \nPage 1 of 4Opinion: Enterprise architecture - dogmatic and over-ambitious? : Articles : Business ...\n27\/01\/2009http:\/\/www.bcs.org\/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.23812\nfor IT) in the NHS. \nSo, perhaps unfairly, how would we characterise EA (given that EA strategists \nusually have nothing but contempt for legacy systems and anything that falls \noutside their view of what applications are acceptable): \nz Technology-led, with standardisation of applications, systems and \ntechnologies used as driver for enforced business change;  \nz Dogmatic, in the sense that nominal standardisation at an enterprise level is \nseen as a more important goal than meeting end users' real requirements;  \nz Over-ambitious, in the sense that few EA strategies seem to be able to stop \nshort of a idealised, perfect scenario;  \nz Unverified, in that no one has properly analysed the achievability or \nsustainability of the proposed EA;  \nz Divorced from the current state, in the sense that although the current state \nis usually shown, there is no analysis of how the first steps can be taken \nfrom the current to the idealised future state;  \nz Futuristic, in the sense that the EA strategy plans so far in advance that it \ndoesn't sensibly guide the immediate next IT strategy steps;  \nz Politicised, in the sense that things are reduced to sound-bites and \nperceptions and not judged on hard analysis of benefits and weaknesses. \nIn summary, we would characterise the EA strategist as a chess player who has \na long-term strategic view of the prefect position, but who disregards his current \nposition and dismisses with contempt (as a short-term tactical necessity) each \nand every move that can practically be made.  \nIn other words, there is simply no way to reach the desired position given the \nstarting point and the possible next moves at one\u2019s disposal. And, perhaps to go \nfurther, the EA strategist blames the current position and the moves available \nwithout considering that their strategy itself might be wrong. With the same \ngiven starting position and using the available moves as a guide, one could \nconstruct a viable and beneficial EA strategy. \nIn a sense, however, the problems engendered by EA go much deeper than \nthis. The question must be asked of how practical it is for one EA team to think, \nwork and operate at an enterprise level and to make decisions that are beneficial \nto the business without working on specific business problems.  \nNot only do analogies with the centrally planned economy come to mind, but also \nquestions about whether the scope of the problem is just too broad. How is it \npossible to judge the viability and suitability of an EA when it is by its nature \nabstracted to a very high level? It's tempting to say that the devil is in the detail \nand EA strategies are prone to proposing an architecture that proves impractical. \nOne example of this can be seen in the NHS, where the strategy for sharing \ndigital medical images (X-rays, MRI scans and so on) across the NHS assumed \nthat if all the images could be stored in a central image database, then the \nproblem would be solved. The EA strategists did not think any deeper than this \nbecause they didn't have to.  \nPage 2 of 4Opinion: Enterprise architecture - dogmatic and over-ambitious? : Articles : Business ...\n27\/01\/2009http:\/\/www.bcs.org\/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.23812\nBut, once the problem is tackled from a practical 'how can digital medical images \nactually be shared effectively', it does not take long for the architect to realise \nthat more than just the raw images are needed and that, in fact, a range of \nrelated patient information must be coordinated along with the images. \nOne could argue that the above is simply an example of a mistake and that it \napplies equally to all technical design: a high-level design can always be \nscuppered by lower level detail. But, it seems to us that EA has deliberately \navoided any contact with the real world, partly though the extreme high level at \nwhich EA work and partly though the de facto principles that govern EA.  \nTechnical architects at the project level do, in my experience, concern \nthemselves with the next level of detail and, as far as possible, propose an \narchitecture that will survive the detailed design process. On the other hand, \nenterprise architects do not do this, in our experience. Instead, the onus is \nplaced 100 per cent on the project architects to deliver within an EA that may be \nflawed, impractical, constantly changing or even internally inconsistent. \nMoreover, an EA can be generated relatively quickly. A five-year IT strategy can \nbe generated by an EA team in 3-6 months, perhaps. What happens then? Do \nthe EA's start to test their EA by monitoring its adoption by various projects? In \nour experience, they do not. Instead, they begin to think further ahead or in \nincreasingly blue-sky terms. The five-year strategy becomes a ten-year strategy \nand the dogma tightens even further. \nAnother problem \nAnother issue we see with EA as it is practised today is the sustainability of the \ntarget architecture, which often involves a massive and unrealistic amount of \nconsolidation and homogenisation. We have started to ask of EA strategies: if \nthat were achieved, how could it be developed or upgraded? And often the \nanswer is that it would be problematic, to say the least. Often business functions \nand applications are consolidated into multi-faceted integrated systems, directly \nused by many thousands of disparate end users.  \nEven to consider how an upgrade might be approached is not an easy question.  \nIncreasingly, we can see these integrated, enterprise-wide components becoming \ninert, stuck at their initial implementation and just too big and too all-\nencompassing to be upgraded. \nFinally, there may be a case that diversity in IT systems (even within an \nenterprise) is a good thing. Standardisation assumes, to some extent, that \nfunctional richness and specificity can be achieved within a pre-defined standard \nframework. But is this true?  \nIn the same way that a large organisation is staffed by diverse human beings, all \nwith their own skills, strengths and weaknesses, why shouldn't the IT systems \ndisplay a degree of diversity? In terms of IT systems, we are not talking here \nabout commodity products (such as PC's, word processor or email clients), we \nare talking about applications that work hand-in-glove with the business users \nwho carry out diverse business processes  This would imply  in our view  the EA \nPage 3 of 4Opinion: Enterprise architecture - dogmatic and over-ambitious? : Articles : Business ...\n27\/01\/2009http:\/\/www.bcs.org\/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.23812\nrecognising diversity across business or departmental boundaries much more \nthan any EA we have seen to date.   \nIf one business process involves a real-time, safety-critical activity where lives \nare at stake and another involves the backroom processing of overtime \npayments, then why should these applications be constrained by the arbitrary \nplatform, technology and user interface standards invented by an EA without any \nreal knowledge of the business requirements and any specific analysis of the \nbusiness benefits that could be gained from deployment of this or that IT \nsystem? \nOn this point, it seems to us, that EA has extended far beyond interoperability \nstandards and specific standards towards a detrimentally generic standardisation \nof everything that can be standardised. Perhaps, in fact, an enterprise architect \nshould be more concerned with understanding the genuine differences in \nbusiness and IT requirements across an enterprise, rather than shoe-horning \nevery corner of the business into a one-size-fits-all EA. \nIn conclusion, we don't have answer to how beneficial an EA approach can be to \na business or government department. In many ways, having an enterprise-wide \nview of things can only be an advantage. We are, however, increasingly \nconcerned that EA concepts are being pushed beyond what can be justified by a \nbusiness-wide cost-benefit analysis and that EA taken too far can adversely \naffect the ability to deliver useful business functionality to end users.   \nIn particular, we believe that enterprise architects should be asked to justify their \nstrategies in terms of overall concrete business benefit much more and to \nprovide far more assurance that the proposed EA is viable and does not \nunnecessarily constrain the ability of the business to benefit from IT systems and \ntechnology innovation. \nJanuary 2009 \n  \nLegal and Privacy Notices \u00a9 Copyright BCS 2009 Systems Status  \nThe BCS is a registered charity: No 292786 Patron: HRH The Duke of Kent KG  \nPage 4 of 4Opinion: Enterprise architecture - dogmatic and over-ambitious? : Articles : Business ...\n27\/01\/2009http:\/\/www.bcs.org\/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.23812\n"}
