The results therefore show that varying the size of the alkaline earth \ncation has a pronounced effect on the ordering of In and Sb within the structure. \n \n \nKeywords: K2NiF4 structure, neutron diffraction, Indium, Antimony \n 3 \nIntroduction \n \nMaterials with the perovskite structure have attracted considerable interest due to such \nsystems displaying a range of properties of technological importance, e.g. \nsuperconductivity, ionic and electronic conductivity, magnetoresistance, dielectric \nproperties, catalysis. Although the general formula for a stoichiometric perovskite oxide \ncan be written AMO3, this simple formula does not indicate the diverse range of \ncompositions that can be prepared. For example it is possible to have more than one \ncation on both the A and M sites, provided the total charge is 6+, with considerable \nattention having been focused on mixed M site cation systems, such as LaM0.5M'0.5O3 (M \nis a 2+ cation, e.g. Mg, Ni, Cu; M' is a 4+ cation, e.g. Ti, Zr) , (Ba\/Sr)M0.5M\u20190.5O3 (M is a \n2+ cation, e.g. Ni, Zn; M\u2019 is a 6+ cation, e.g. W), or  (Ba\/Sr)M0.33M'0.67O3 (M is a 2+ \ncation, e.g. Mg, Ca, Ni, Cu; M' is a 5+ cation, e.g. Nb, Ta).[ see for example 1-14] \nA related structure to that of perovskite is the K2NiF4 structure in which perovskite-type \nlayers are separated by rock salt layers (figure 1). A wide range of materials with this \nstructure-type have been prepared and studied including the well-known La2CuO4 based \nsuperconductor La2-xBaxCuO4 [15-17]. The general formula of these compounds can be \nwritten A2MO4, although in contrast to the wide range of materials reported with two \ncations of different charge on the octahedral M site in perovskites (as outlined above), \nthere have been few reports of such compounds with the K2NiF4 structure. In order to \nrectify this, we have tried to prepare some examples of such samples, and in this paper \nwe report the synthesis and structures of the novel compounds A2In0.5Sb0.5O4 (A= Sr, \nBa). To our knowledge these are the first examples of K2NiF4 compounds of general \n 4 \nformula A2MIII0.5M'V0.5O4 with both 3+ and 5+ cations in the octahedral sites. We show \nthat the alkaline earth cation size can have a key effect on the ordering of In and Sb on \nthe octahedral (M) site. \n \nExperimental \n \nHigh purity, SrCO3, BaCO3, In2O3 and Sb2O3 were used to prepare the compounds \nA2In0.5Sb0.5O4 (A=Sr, Ba). The powders were ground in the required stoichiometric \nproportions and heated at 1100\u00b0C for Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4, and 1000\u00b0C for Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 for \n12 hours, before regrinding and reheating at 1200\u00b0C and 1100\u00b0C respectively for a \nfurther 12 hours. Phase purity was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction (Seifert \nXRD 3003TT diffractometer). Attempts to prepare a similar compound containing Ca, \ni.e. Ca2In0.5Sb0.5O4, were unsuccessful, showing that there is a minimal alkaline earth size \nfor the stabilisation of these phases. \nNeutron diffraction data were collected for Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 and Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4 on \ndiffractometers HRPD and POLARIS, ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. \nRefinement of the neutron diffraction data employed the GSAS suite of programs [18]. \n \n \nResults \n \nX-ray diffraction showed the successful synthesis of the compounds Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4 and \nSr2In0.5Sb0.5O4, and so the structures of these materials were determined by neutron \n 5 \ndiffraction. Both materials were initially run on diffractometer Polaris. However, for \nBa2In0.5Sb0.5O4 it was shown that significant changes to the sample had occurred. These \nchanges were attributed to water incorporation into the sample, supported by TGA \nstudies, leading to an expansion along the c axis (as evidenced by a shift in the (002) peak \nto lower angle) and a loss of crystallinity. A similar ability to readily incorporate water \nhas been previously reported in the related K2NiF4 system, Ba2ZrO4 [19,20]. As a result \nof these problems with the original Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4 sample, the sample was re-examined \non diffractometer HRPD after heating at 1000\u00b0C for 2 hours to remove this water, before \ncollecting the neutron diffraction data.  \nFurther studies on the effect of water incorporation in these materials, as well as \nfluorination studies, are in progress, and will be reported later. Here we report the \nstructures of these novel phases. \n \nStructure refinement: Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 and Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4 \n \nRefinement of the data for Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4 was attempted using the tetragonal space \ngroup I4\/mmm commonly observed for K2NiF4-type compounds. Using this space group \na good fit to the data was obtained and the refined structural parameters are given in table \n1 with selected bond distances in table 2 and the neutron profiles in figure 2. This model \ndoes not allow for any ordering of In and Sb, and so assumes a random distribution of \nboth cations on the octahedral sites within the structure. \nAttempts to refine the data for Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 with space group I4\/mmm gave a poor fit \nto the data with evidence for a number of unfitted peaks. The unfitted peaks could be \n 6 \nindexed on a \u221a2 a x \u221a2 b  x c cell, with a small orthorhombic splitting. It was thought that \nthis expanded cell may be due to In\/Sb ordering. Therefore, a number of space groups \nwere attempted, allowing for possible ordering of In and Sb in the octahedral sites, to \ninclude ordering of In and Sb within a layer, and ordering based on alternate layers of In \nand Sb. The best fit was obtained for the orthorhombic space group Pmcb, with ordering \nof In and Sb within each layer (figure 3). The refined data indicated that there was \ncomplete ordering of In and Sb in the structure, with attempts at placing some In on the \nSb site and vice-versa giving rise to zero occupancy after refinement. For the oxygen \nsites (O2, O3), the thermal displacement parameters were initially quite high, and so \nthese oxygens were allowed to move off-site creating split sites for these positions. This \nresulted in improved R factors and significantly reduced thermal parameters for these \noxygen atoms. The final refined structural data are given in table 3 with selected bond \ndistances in table 4. The neutron profile fits are shown in figure 4.   \nIn order to confirm that there was no ordering in Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4, the ordered \u221a2 a x \u221a2 b  \nx c structural model for Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 was also examined for this sample., although this \nrefinement proved unstable. Therefore, since a good fit to the data had been achieved for \nspace group I4\/mmm (table 1), and there were no extra peaks observed for this sample, it \nwas concluded that the initial model, with a random distribution of In and Sb, was valid.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe synthesis and structural characterisation of the new K2NiF4 type compounds \nBa2In0.5Sb0.5O4 and Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 have been shown. The structural studies have \n 7 \ndemonstrated that the size of the alkaline earth cation has a key influence on the ordering \nof In and Sb within the structure. In Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4, the neutron diffraction data shows no \nevidence for any long range ordering of In and Sb in the octahedral sites, although it is \npossible that some short range ordering may exist. In addition, the bond distances (table \n2) show that the In\/Sb-O6 octahedra are regular.  In the case of Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4, however, \nlong range ordering of In and Sb does occur, leading to alternating In and Sb within the \nlayers. This ordering results in an expanded \u221a2 a x \u221a2 b  x c cell, and a small \northorhombic distortion. In this structure there is also some significant tilting of the \noctahedra (figure 3). This can be explained from calculations of the tolerance factors for \nboth Ba2In0.5Sb0.5O4 and Sr2In0.5Sb00.5O4. For the former, a tolerance factor of 0.97 is \nobtained, consistent with the near ideal K2NiF4 structure observed. In contrast, the \ntolerance factor for Sr2In0.5Sb0.5O4 is significantly lower (0.91), which is consistent with a \nneed for tilting of the octahedra to alleviate structural strain. In addition to such tilting, \nthe octahedra are non-regular with significant differences between apical and equatorial \nbond lengths (table 4).  The smaller size of Sb versus In causes the equatorial oxygens \n(O1) to move closer to the Sb, leading to the four equatorial bonds for the SbO6 octahedra \nbeing significantly shorter than those for the InO6 octahedra (1.965 vs 2.126\u00c5).  In \ncontrast, the apical bond lengths are shorter for the InO6 octahedra (2.008 vs 2.114\u00c5). \nOverall therefore, the SbO6 octahedra have four short equatorial bond lengths and two \nlong axial bond lengths, while for the InO6 octahedra the situation is reversed. In terms of \nthe average bond distances, the value for the SbO6 octahedra is smaller than that for the \nInO6 octahedra, as expected from ionic radii considerations. \n 8 \nIn conclusion, these phases are, to our knowledge, the first examples of K2NiF4 \ncompounds of general formula A2MIII0.5M'V0.5O4 with both 3+ and 5+ cations in the \noctahedral sites, and suggest that further studies in this area are worthwhile. The neutron \ndiffraction data shows that varying the size of the alkaline earth cation has a pronounced \neffect on the ordering of In and Sb within the structure. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe would like to thank EPSRC for funding (studentship to RH).
