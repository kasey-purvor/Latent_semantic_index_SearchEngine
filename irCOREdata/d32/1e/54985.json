Its main aim is to \nunderstand how policing needs to be developed in communities today. \u2018Communities\u2019 \nhere are understood loosely as those living, working or otherwise interacting in \nidentifiable contexts such as neighbourhoods. Essentially, the argument is that self-\npolicing, structurally coupled with self-regulating policing organisations, is the best \n(or least worst) way of keeping order in contemporary society. The paper considers \nempirical evidence on community policing to support its arguments. \n \nSocial order can be thought of as a state of affairs where a group of people (however \nconstituted) follow a common set of rules of conduct. Social order is, in its simplest \nterms, a product of social capital (see Halpern, 2005). It includes Hunter\u2019s (1995) \n 2\nparochial and private orders,TPF1FPT as well as the public orders of state and market. The \nmaintenance of social order then refers to the processes by which the shared rules of \nconduct are established, upheld and enforced (see Crawford and Newburn, 2002, p \n480). This maintenance is called \u2018policing\u2019, whatever the context \u2013 family, \ncommunity, market or state (see Loader, 2000, p 334). Policing is therefore carried \nout by a wide variety of individuals and organisations, not just the public police. \nPolicing can then be interpreted, pace Crawford et al. (2005, p. 4) as \u2018intentional \naction involving the conscious exercise of power or authority (by an individual or \norganisation) that is directed towards rule enforcement, the promotion of order or \nassurances of safety.\u2019 \n \nThe argument of this paper has three main components: \n \n1) The development of a concept of public self-policing, whereby order is \nmaintained by the people themselves. This can occur in two main ways: the \nrules of conduct can be unstated, implicit or presupposed, as in the case of the \nactivities of people going about their everyday business, observing the \nbehaviour of themselves and others, and occasionally taking corrective action. \nOr, exceptionally, the rules can be made explicit, agreed among the people and \ncollectively accepted as binding upon them. \n2) Self-policing is limited, in a number of respects. It may fail to protect \nindividuals and minorities within a community, its rules of conduct may fall \nshort of more widely accepted ethical standards, or it may lack the capacity to \ndeal with more serious breaches of its rules. Independent policing \norganisations are therefore required to maintain order in certain cases. \n3) These policing organisations need to interact cooperatively with the public, \nmaintaining a balance between their role as impartial enforcers of law and \norder and their role as supporters of the community\u2019s self-policing. As street-\nlevel bureaucrats, they have multiple accountabilities, which have to be \nmanaged democratically. \n \nIt is not the intention of this paper to assess all the various theories of policing. \nRather, the purpose is to develop a concept of public self-policing and then to revisit \napproaches to policing in the light of this development.  \n \nPublic self-policing \n \nThe term \u2018informal social control\u2019 is commonly used to refer to the maintenance of \norder by members of the public or of a particular community. Silver and Miller (2004, \np.553), for example, define it as the \u2018willingness of neighborhood residents to actively \nengage in behaviors aimed at preventing criminal and deviant behavior in the local \narea\u2019. Such activity, however, is not necessarily informal, nor is it appropriately \ncharacterised as \u2018social control\u2019. \n \nIt was Jane Jacobs (1961) who first pointed out that routine surveillance by people \ngoing about their daily business tended to reduce the incidence of transgressive, anti-\nsocial or criminal behaviour (see also Shotland and Goodstein, 1984). For this reason, \n                                                 \nTP\n1\nPT The private order is based on the family and informal primary groups; the parochial order refers to the \nnetworks of local institutions such as local shops, schools, churches and community associations. \n 3\nshe advocated the mixed use of public space, in order to maximise the number of eyes \nand ears of the public engaged in this practice. The explanation for her findings could \nbe that potential transgressors are deterred by the risk, however slight,TPF2FPT that others \nmight intervene or might bear witness against them later on, or perhaps by the shame \nthat might be attached to being seen as a transgressor. This would mean that the \neffectiveness of such action by others depends upon the response to it in terms of \nindividual self-policing, whether \u2018self\u2019 here is understood in terms of a rational self \n(calculating the balance of risk and reward) or in terms of an ethical self (concerned \nwith protecting and enhancing one\u2019s sense of self-value or self-esteem, as well as the \nesteem with which one is held by others). \n \nLater, Jacobs\u2019 insight was \u2018explained\u2019 in a different way, in terms of what is called \n\u2018routine activities theory\u2019 (Cohen and Felson, 1979; Felson, 1998). According to this \ntheory, crime (and, by extension, other forms of transgression) is largely the result of \nthree factors coming together: a likely transgressor, a suitable target (or victim) and \nthe absence of effective intermediaries either to \u2018handle\u2019 the transgressor or to \u2018guard\u2019 \nthe target or victim. In Jacobs\u2019 scenarios, members of the public act mainly as \nguardians of the public space (which includes all kinds of potential targets and \nvictims), though they may also at times intervene in order to \u2018handle\u2019 potential or \nactual transgressors (e.g. challenging strangers, and \u2018have-a-go\u2019 heroes). This \napproach therefore highlights the importance to social order of having effective \nintermediaries. \n \nBut what makes for effective intermediaries? Understandably, people are prepared to \nchallenge strangers, step forward as witnesses, and so on, only where they feel \nconfident of their own safety and a reasonable level of trust in criminal justice \ninstitutions. Effective intermediation requires: \u2018trusting others in the sure knowledge \nthat they won\u2019t be let down or disillusioned\u2019 (Shaftoe, 2004, p 201). \u2018Informal social \ncontrol\u2019 therefore depends crucially on trust, which can be understood in Luhmann\u2019s \n(1986) terms as the willingness to assume risk. \n \nMutual monitoring and a willingness to intervene founded on confidence and trust are \ntherefore key ingredients of \u2018informal social control\u2019. Strictly speaking, however, as \nMisztal (2000) has shown, such processes are not purely informal because they \ninvolve a balance between formality and informality, specifically between the \ninformality of mutual monitoring and surveillance and the formality of codes of \nbehaviour embedded in public and institutional cultures. Nor does it seem appropriate \nto describe such processes as involving \u2018social control\u2019, insofar as the latter appears to \nimply that certain individuals or a group of them (namely, the so-called \u2018law-abiding\u2019) \nare controlling other individuals or groups (namely, \u2018deviants\u2019 of some kind), whereas \nhere it is a case of everyone controlling everyone else. For these reasons, it may be \nbetter to call this \u2018self-governance\u2019 (Kooiman, 2003, p 83) or self-regulation. Self-\n                                                 \nTP\n2\nPT Field studies involving staged crimes (e.g. Latane and Darley, 1970) have shown that bystanders do \nnot generally intervene where transgressions (assaults, damage to property, dropping litter, etc) are \ntaking place, because they have difficulty in, firstly, noticing the incident, then interpreting it as a \ncrime, and finally, in intervening to provide help (e.g. because of the risk of harm to themselves). \nEvidence also indicates that crime is reduced by people willing to act to challenge strangers, supervise \nyouths, and step forward as witnesses (Shotland and Goodstein, 1984). Understandably, this is less \nlikely to happen in less stable areas (Skogan, 1990). \n 4\npolicing can then be understood as a type or aspect of self-governance or self-\nregulation. \n \nBut what is the \u2018self\u2019 here? What is the public that is policing itself? Harris (2006, p \n63) shows that readiness to intervene when a rule is breached is related to many \ndifferent factors, including whether the perpetrators of the breach are known to the \nwitness or whether the witness is known to them; whether it occurs in the witness\u2019s \nown immediate neighbourhood (Harris, 2006, p 64); whether fellow bystanders are \nseen as people like them (Levine et al., 2002, p 3); whether the authorities are \nperceived as responsive, effective, supportive or trustworthy (Silver and Miller, 2004, \np 558); the perceived risk of harm to themselves; and the perception of one\u2019s own \nresponsibility\/duty or of the value of intervening (Hawdon et al., 2003; Barnes and \nBaylis, 2004, p 101).  \n \nThis body of evidence suggests that key conditions for intervening include not only \nhaving trust in one\u2019s fellows and in the authorities (balanced against a judgment of the \nlikely costs and benefits of intervening) but also having a certain social status or \nreputation in a community and responsibilities associated with that status. The public \nthat is being policed is not something spatially or socially fixed but varies according \nto the nature of the relations among its members, as well as according to the relations \nits members have with external authorities. This finding suggests that self-policing \nmay have certain limitations as a way of maintaining social order. These are \nconsidered in the next section of the paper. \n \nThe need for policing organisations \n \nSelf-policing, therefore, defined as a process in which a public polices itself through \nroutine and largely unorganised mutual monitoring and surveillance, with a general \nreadiness to intervene to counter transgressions (and to support victims), is necessary \nfor maintaining order.TPF3FPT There are, however, a number of important drawbacks to self-\npolicing, which limit its effectiveness for a just and peaceful society. These \ndrawbacks occur where publics or communities are dominated by criminal gangs, \nwhose rule is typically reinforced by an \u2018anti-grassing\u2019 culture (so that criminal \nactivities such as drug-dealing go unchecked or even condoned \u2013 see, for example, \nFlint, 2002, or Shiner et al, 2004 TPF4FPT), where members of the public take the law into \ntheir own hands (that is, vigilantism), where social relations are highly unstable (so \nmutual trust is lacking and social statuses are not mutually recognised), and where \ncommunities are deeply illiberal, unequal, hierarchical or divided, for example along \nracial lines.TPF5FPT Self-policing is also inherently limited to the extent that it is dependent \nupon policing by others to deal with problems that cannot be ordinarily solved by \nmembers of the public going about their everyday business (e.g. serious and violent \ncrime). Finally, a reliance on self-policing alone for the maintenance of social order \n                                                 \nTP\n3\nPT Even if the intervention is only to report the transgression to a public policing agency \u2013 because \notherwise the latter are unlikely to be aware of the transgression. \nTP\n4\nPT See also Reynolds (1986), Hagan and McCarthy (1997), Walklate and Evans (1999), Page (2000), \nHancock (2001), Bottoms and Wiles (2002), Chappell and Lanza-Kaduce (2004, pp 9-10) and Karn \n(2005). \nTP\n5\nPT One might imagine that factors such as authoritative parenting, job stability, strong social ties and \npeer influences would serve the cause of self-policing but this has not been established, either \ntheoretically or empirically.  \n 5\nwould be unfair because some communities are less able to police themselves than \nothers, and these tend to be ones that are poorer and suffer more from problems of \ncrime and disorder (Scott, 2002).TPF6FPT \n \nFor all these reasons, there is a need for independent, impartial policing organisations, \ndedicated to the maintenance of social order, and structurally coupled with different \nforms of self-policing. This means that such policing by \u2018others\u2019 has to vary according \nto the conditions that obtain in different communities.TPF7FPT Arguably, this can happen \nonly if those who are doing the policing have the knowledge and understanding of \nthose conditions and the skills to work with those communities in the co-production \nof social order \u2013 in other words, some form of community policing. The next section \nconsiders what form this might take.  \n \nCommunity policing \n \nThere are numerous definitions of community policing but they appear to have three \ncommon features: police-community partnerships, a problem-solving approach, and \norganisational decentralisation (see Oliver, 1998, pp 32-43; see also Community \nPolicing Consortium, 1994). Oliver\u2019s (1998, p 51) definition seems most \ncomprehensive: \n \nA systematic approach to policing with the paradigm of instilling and fostering \na sense of community, within a geographical neighborhood, to improve the \nquality of life. It achieves this through the decentralization of the police and \nthe implementation of a synthesis of three key components: (1) \u2026 the \nredistribution of traditional police resources; (2) \u2026 the interaction of police \nand all community members to reduce crime and the fear of crime through \nindigenous proactive programs; and (3) \u2026 a concerted effort to tackle the \ncauses of crime problems rather than to put band-aids on the symptoms. \n \nTo this should be added the argument that policing is a concern not just for the police \nin interaction with communities but also for other agencies with responsibilities for \npreventing and reducing crime \u2013 what Jones and Newburn (2002) have called \nsecondary agencies of crime control.TPF8FPT \n \nConsidering Oliver\u2019s definition, it seems clear that the key feature of community \npolicing is interaction between policing organisations and communities. The other \n                                                 \nTP\n6\nPT In an increasing number of countries, public self-policing has become more difficult in recent years, \ndue to factors such as increased economic and population instability, poor urban design, and the rise of \ngated communities. \nTP\n7\nPT Numerous commentators have observed how the efforts of the public police can weaken self-policing \n\u2013 see in particular Bursik and Grasmick (1993) and Renauer (2007, p 62). Where such self-policing is \ncausing harm, however, it may be necessary to weaken it as a preliminary to achieving more ethical \nforms of self-policing. \nTP\n8\nPT Much of the rise in crime in late twentieth century Britain has been attributed to a reduction in \nsecondary control activities: \u2018There has been a marked decrease in employment in a range of \noccupations providing \u201cnatural surveillance\u201d and other low level controls as a corollary to their primary \nfunctions\u2019 (Jones and Newburn (2002, p 140), and this decline is \u2018implicated in the rise in levels of \ncrime\u2019 (Jones and Newburn, 2002, p 142). This finding has clear policy implications in terms of \nrevitalising \u2018natural surveillance\u2019 occupations, such as park keepers, rent collectors, neighbourhood \nwardens, etc. \n 6\ntwo features are secondary, in that the purpose of the decentralisation is to achieve \nmore effective interaction, and the interaction itself includes forms of joint problem-\nsolving. What is less clear, however, is the nature of the interaction that is envisaged, \nand how policing organisations are supposed to instil and foster a sense of community \nis not made clear at all.TPF9FPT \n \nLet us first analyse what co-production might mean.TPF10FPT It suggests something more \nthan consultation, where policing organisations may canvass the public\u2019s views but \nthen decide for themselves the best course of action to take. Rather, it implies that \npolicing decisions will be taken jointly, in an arena or forum of some kind where \npolicing organisations and publics are represented. This raises questions, however, \nabout the nature of such forums, how they are set up, how the different parties are \nrepresented in them, what authority the participants have to ensure that forum \ndecisions are implemented, how the decision-makers are held to account for their \ndecisions, and what happens in the event of failure to reach agreement on policing \npriorities, strategy or tactics. Where a public lacks representation, its capacity needs to \nbe built if it is to become an effective partner. Such capacity-building, however, \nwould take the police in particular well beyond their traditional role of law \nenforcement (Mastrowski et al., 1995, p 540). It should also be noted that co-\nproduction relates not only to decision-making processes but also to the \nimplementation and evaluation of decisions made, e.g. regular communications from \nthe police to the public and regular feedback from the public to the police about \ncommunity conditions and the effectiveness of policing interventions. \n \nReviews of the literature on community policing suggest that the evidence for its \nimpact on communities is mixed and the interpretation of that evidence is fraught with \ndifficulties (Greene and Taylor, 1988; Cordner, 1998; Rosenbaum et al., 1998). In an \nassessment of six community policing programmes across the US, for example, \nSkogan (1994) found that fear of crime was reduced in all of them, and communities\u2019 \nfavourable assessments of police services either remained the same or increased \ncompared with similar communities not receiving these services. In particular, Skogan \n(1994, p 180) noted that: \u2018Where officers have developed sustained cooperation with \ncommunity groups and fostered self-help, the public has witnessed declining levels of \nsocial disorder and physical decay.\u2019 Later, Skogan and Hartnett\u2019s (1997) assessment \nof community policing in Chicago suggested that it had a significant impact on \ncommunity problems and the quality of community life.  \n \nMany, perhaps most, community policing initiatives, however, not only in the US but \nacross the world, do not appear to be systematically linked to community \ndevelopment or crime prevention, so positive community impacts are hard to find. \nIndeed, some commentators, such as Brogden and Nijhar (2005), have argued that in \nmost areas in most countries the impacts of introducing community policing have \nbeen harmful, mainly because they take no account either of local community \n                                                 \nTP\n9\nPT Some commentators consider this ideal of community policing to be unrealistic and undesirable. For \nexample: \u2018COPS [Community-Oriented Policing Service] officers can hardly be expected to grow \ncommunity where none exists even if they can overcome the suspicion or overt hostility of many of the \npeople who live there. Moreover, even if community could be imposed top-down, to try to do so would \nviolate the COPS philosophy\u2019 (Chappell and Lanza-Kaduce, 2004, p 9). \nTP\n10\nPT In relation to policing, the term \u2018coproduction\u2019 seems to have been first used by Skolnick and Bayley \n(1988). \n 7\nconditions (in particular how communities police themselves) or the state of local \npolice forces (who are frequently corrupt, violent, feared, hated and\/or despised).TPF11FPT \nOn the positive side, however, where community policing has the effect of increasing \nthe perceived legitimacy of the police, the maintenance of social order is likely to \nimprove (see list of references in Renauer, 2007, p 64). TPF12FPT There is also evidence that \nself-policing \u2018can be enhanced by bringing police and residents closer together, \nparticularly through police-resident collaborations or partnerships\u2019 (Renauer, 2007, p \n63 \u2013 see list of references). \n \nConsidering forums and beat meetings in particular, Bayley (1994) found that they \nvaried greatly in their composition. Some represented geographical communities and \nothers interest groups (shopkeepers, ethnic minorities, gays, business users, etc). They \nhad four main functions: advising the police about local needs and priorities; helping \npolice educate other citizens about crime and disorder and enlist the cooperation of \nthe public in this; allowing residents to ventilate grievances against the police and \npermitting the police to respond directly; and providing information to the police \nabout the relative success of the latter\u2019s efforts. It is important to note that none of \nthese involved joint decision-making between police and public. Similarly, Skogan \n(2005, p 17, cited in Renauer, 2007, p 66) characterised some of Chicago\u2019s police beat \nmeetings as \u2018laundry meetings\u2019, in which residents air their problems (\u2018drop off their \nshirts\u2019), the police state they will look into them, and at later meetings residents listen \nto police reports of what they have done. Again, this means that residents are not \ninvolved in the development of solutions to their problems or in how those solutions \nmight be implemented. This can undermine self-policing by making residents too \ndependent on policing organisations for solving their problems.  \n \nA further criticism is that only a small minority of residents are actively involved in \ncommunity forums, and they may not be representative of the community as a \n                                                 \nTP\n11\nPT Evidence from around the world, including countries in Europe, Africa, the Indian sub-continent and \nLatin America, suggests that \u2018community policing is, at best, unproven practice. At worst, it is simply a \npractice that reinforces existing schisms and inequalities\u2019 (Brogden and Nijhar, 2005, p 161). In the \nUK, for example, community policing does not really exist. The initiatives that come closest to it are \nthe National Reassurance Policing Programme (NRPP) and, from 2008, the creation of neighbourhood \npolicing teams in all police authority areas. The former aims to deliver dedicated high-visibility police, \nmaking officers more accessible, familiar and responsive to local residents, and increasing the quality \nand quantity of community intelligence (Crawford et al, 2005, p 10). Evaluation to date suggests that it \nis generally supported by members of the public and can produce a modest increase in linking social \ncapital (Singer, 2004). Crawford and Lister (2004, pp viii-ix) report \u2018a reasonably well established \nmixed economy of residential patrols\u2019, with different foci (engaging local residents, improving the \nenvironment, or concentrating directly on incidents or \u2018hotspots\u2019) and different styles of policing \n(emphasising enforcement, patrol or problem solving through partnerships). However, Crawford and \nLister (2004, p viii) also state that there is a lack of coordination among the different providers of \nreassurance policing and unclarity about their different boundaries, roles, responsibilities, and \nlimitations, which can leave the public uncertain about the identity, functions and powers of different \npolicing providers and unsure what can legitimately be expected of them. There appears to be no clear \nstrategic approach to community engagement, and little understanding of the \u2018levels\u2019 and potential \ncomplexity of such engagement. For example, none of the four \u2018models\u2019 of plural policing identified by \nCrawford et al (2005, pp 89-90) defines a clear role for the community in defining the type of policing \nprovision, in planning how this type of policing will be provided, or even in its day-to-day operations. \nTP\n12\nPT Legitimacy is of course important for effective policing of any kind \u2013 see, for example, Ballintyne \nand Fraser (2000, p 173), Hancock (2001, p 150). \n 8\nwhole.TPF13FPT As Brogden and Nijhar (2005, p 54) note: \u2018All the evidence on community \npolicing forums is that they tend to reflect only a minority view of the locale, that \nmembers increasingly see themselves as acting on behalf of policing interests, and \nthat other minorities as well as some majorities are rarely involved in the forum \ndeliberations.\u2019 Van den Broek (2002) points out that new multi-agency networks \n(such as crime and disorder reduction partnerships in England) may actually reduce \ncommunity participation, so that:  \n \nPolice end up relying on self-appointed representatives to identify problems \nand concerns for the rest of the community. Even when police encourage \nwider participation, such invitations are rarely accepted partly because of \ntraditional police-minority hostile relations and partly because of the historical \ndisenfranchisement and marginalisation of groups such as lower class young \npeople. \n(Brogden and Nijhar, 2005, p 55). \n \nAlthough community policing initiatives have achieved some improvements in \npolicing in certain areas, therefore, it does not seem to be the case that any community \nhas gained \u2018ownership\u2019 over policing by this means \u2013 or, if they have, the \u2018owners\u2019 \nrepresent only a minority of the community. Where police-community partnerships \nexist, they cannot be said to be of equals because it is the police who make all the real \ndecisions. This is perhaps most clear in the studies of \u2018Weed and Seed\u2019 in Seattle (see \nLyons, 1999). Here community development was subordinated to a crime control \nagenda that stemmed from the federal government not from the public: \u2018If community \nmembers want the police to engage in an activity that is not on the police agenda \n(because it is not cost effective, because it does not strengthen police organisation, \nbecause it limits police discretion, under-utilizes police manpower, and so on) they \nmay have little potential to challenge the practical decision-makers\u2019 (Brogden and \nNijhar, 2005, p 74). \n \nConsequently, Brogden and Nijhar (2005) argue that community policing is an \nideology or set of powerful myths (see also Robin, 2000, and Manning, 2004),TPF14FPT \nwhich resonates well with the \u2018new public management\u2019 of public services \u2013 \nessentially, it is a way of delivering policing products to an increasingly diverse \ncommunity of consumers.TPF15FPT Rather than being a systematic adaptation to this \n                                                 \nTP\n13\nPT See, for example, Rowe (2004) on how so-called \u2018community leaders\u2019 can be out of touch with their \ncommunities. \nTP\n14\nPT Manning (2004) argues that the police engage in a form of magic, in that they mimic or simulate \nreligion (specialised costumes, roles, equipments, rituals and beliefs) but stand apart from their fellow \nhuman beings. Collectively, they are both sacrificers (as enforcers of the law) and sacrificial victims \n(e.g. the \u2018thin blue line\u2019). It is only through sacrificing themselves that they maintain connection to \nordinary society. \nTP\n15\nPT In the UK, for example, the general emphasis of recent governmental approaches to policing has \nbeen on developing active citizens, active consumers (of private security) and active communities, with \nindividuals, organisations and communities being increasingly expected to assume responsibility for \nmanaging their own crime risks, while policing organisations are increasingly expected to support that \nmanagement by being responsive and contractually accountable to individuals, organisations and \ncommunities (Crawford, 1997; Loader, 2000, p 331; Spalek, 2008, p 94). There has been a double shift \nin focus, from the public police to plural policing and from political to contractual governance \n(Crawford, 2003; Lister, 2006). At the same time, there has been a widening of the state\u2019s net of social \ncontrol, with the enlisting of individuals, organisations and communities in the service of policing \nobjectives (with, for example, increasing powers of policing being made available to local \n 9\nchanging environment, however, it seems to be in most cases a method of strategic \nbuffering of the traditional core police mandate of crime control (Zhao, 1996). \n\u2018Community-oriented policing is an excellent PR tool for an organisation that cannot \n\u201csolve crime\u201d but which seeks to assure the community that it is \u201cdoing something\u201d.\u2019 \n(Brogden and Nijhar, 2005, p 78). In practice, what happens is that:  \n \n\u2026 the police determine the nature of the community, its problems, and how \nsuch problems should be responded to. Other community problems \u2013 \nunemployment, bad housing, poor health facilities, and so on \u2013 are now \nconstructed as second order problems. Recognising the latter as a greater \npriority than crime, or as the real cause of crime, would diminish the police \nautonomy and authority in determining communal social order and communal \nvalues. It precludes intervention by non-police agencies. Community policing \nallows the police to coordinate those other agencies under its own banner and \nleadership to solve its definition of the priority of community problems. \n(Brogden and Nijhar, 2005, p 65)  \n \nThe result of such strategic buffering is that traditional law enforcement goes on much \nas before: \u2018The same \u201cmiscreants\u201d are \u201cmoved on\u201d on the streets, the same groups of \nyouths end up in custody, and the same middle class citizens have their views of law \nand order reaffirmed\u2019 (Brogden and Nijhar, 2005, p 79). \n \nIn general, community policing initiatives take little care to ensure that police beats \ncorrespond to \u2018natural\u2019 communities (Skogan and Hartnett, 1997); they ignore and \neven exacerbate issues of conflict, diversity and difference (Boostrom, 2000), and \nignore issues of institutional representation, participation and democracy \n(Mastrowski, 1988); they tend \u2018to empower those who want more policing at the \nexpense of others who may justifiably expect more control over the police\u2019 (Brogden \nand Nijhar, 2005, p 55); they legitimise the penetration of communities by powerful \ngovernment agencies, increasing the relative power of the police among these \nagencies, and thereby weakening the democratic rule of law (Bayley, 1994); and they \nwork best where they are least needed, that is in homogeneous communities with little \ncrime where support for the police is almost universal, and worst where they are most \nneeded, that is in heterogeneous or divided communities and the poorest communities, \nwhere crime is high and support for the police is lowest (Brogden and Nijhar, 2005, \npp 61-2). \n \nIn all, therefore, the evidence on community policing in practice, with the possible \nexception of a small number of cities in the US, is far from encouraging. The main \nproblems seem to be that police forces remain unchanged as command and control \nstructures dedicated to law enforcement and crime fighting, that their accountability to \ncommunities remains vague and very much at the discretion of the police themselves, \nthat the role and potential of community self-policing are not understood or taken \n                                                                                                                                            \ncommunities), but also a narrowing of the net\u2019s mesh, with increasing managerialisation and new \ndisciplinary mechanisms, such as Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), which increase the state\u2019s \nregulation of public space (Brown, 2004). In general, \u2018new public management\u2019 seeks to replace \naccountability to the users of relevant services (the \u2018public\u2019 in the sense of a living, breathing \npopulation) with accountability to whoever is paying for the relevant services (ultimately, this is the \ntaxpayer \u2013 an abstract general \u2018public\u2019).  \n \n 10\nseriously by policing agencies, and that communities are not being developed so that \nthey can work effectively with policing agencies.TPF16FPT These problems are addressed in \nthe next section of this paper. \n \nCommunity policing as street-level bureaucracy \n \nFor community policing to work, there needs to be a better balance of the multiple \naccountabilities of community policing agents. The current situation is described by \nBrogden and Nijhar (2005, p 57) as follows: \n \nPolice agencies define the parameters of what matters are relevant to \ncommunity accountability and have the means to enforce their determination \nof the limits of that community influence. In doing so, community policing \nprovides a chimera of accountability. It may legitimate police determination of \ncommunity goals and priorities, bypassing conventional democratic channels \nwith a more direct interactional relationship rather than opening up new \navenues and opportunities for democratic accountability (Klockars, 1988). \n \nThis section argues that community police agents are an example of street-level \nbureaucrats and considers how the literature on street-level bureaucracy can be used \nto clarify how community policing should be organised. \n \nStreet-level bureaucrats were originally characterised by Lipsky (1980) as workers \nwho have high degrees of discretion (or freedom of action) in the organisation of their \nwork, which involves the discharge of public duties and powers including the delivery \nof services, the dispensation of benefits and the allocation of public sanctions. Street-\nlevel bureaucrats see themselves as professionals, who can be trusted to have the \nnecessary expertise to do their jobs, which they define more in terms of relationships \nthan rules. Their relationships with the public, however, are typically asymmetrical \nbecause they have specific resources available that the public does not. \n \nStreet-level bureaucrats can be held to account in three different directions: vertically \nupwards, through political or administrative hierarchies, based on legal authority and \nimplemented through task-oriented enforcement or indicator-oriented performance; \nhorizontally, through forms of peer review and collective self-regulation, based on \nexpertise and implemented through professionalised networks; and vertically \n\u2018downwards\u2019, through forms of participatory citizenship, based on democratic values \nand implemented through impact-oriented co-production. Hupe and Hill (2007) argue \nthat street-level bureaucrats practise multiple accountability and the form that \naccountability takes varies according to four factors: the core issue; the character of \nthe relationships between accountors and accountees; the role of the citizen; and the \ntype of \u2018accountability regime\u2019 (based on the modes of implementation mentioned \nabove) (Hupe and Hill, 2007, p 292). \n \nApplying these ideas to policing practice, core issues can be identified such as the \ndetection or prevention of crime, the enforcement of public order, responsiveness to \npublic demands or the assurance of community safety. Each issue involves different \n                                                 \nTP\n16\nPT These problems are indicative of problems with public sector services generally \u2013 see, for example, \nSeddon (2008). \n 11\nbalances of accountabilities, with emphases on different kinds of enforcement, \nperformance and co-production. Each approach to policing gives priority to a \nparticular direction of accountability: traditional law enforcement stresses \naccountability upwards, problem-oriented policing favours the expertise and judgment \nof one\u2019s fellow officers, while community policing emphasises co-production \nbetween police and community.  \n \nFor Hupe and Hill (2007, p 294), co-production involves individual compliance with \ninternalised professional standards, organisational conformity to shared goals, \nrelationships of trust between accountors and accountees, and citizen voice in holding \nto account. In the case of community policing, this means that individual policing \nagentsTPF17FPT have to be allowed to develop their own ways of working in partnership with \ncommunity members, that their organisations have to work with communities to agree \non common aims and objectives for community policing, that communities and police \nhave to learn to trust each other, and that all citizens need to be included in police-\ncommunity forums. \n \nThe implications of this analysis are profound. It appears that, for co-production of \nsocial order to work, at least three conditions must be satisfied. First, each public or \nset of publics has to operate as a self-organised system, in which order is maintained \nthrough the spontaneous interaction between members of the public; second, each \npolicing organisation or set of policing organisations has to function as a separate \nself-regulating system, in which the rules are defined by the police as street-level \nbureaucrats acting individually and collectively; and third, self-organised or self-\nregulating systems of publics on the one hand and policing organisations on the other \nhave to be structurally coupled so that each couple (for example, a public and a \npolicing organisation) itself forms a co-ordination system. \n \nTo illustrate this, consider what must happen in a neighbourhood where crime is high \nbut trust in the police is low. The community is likely to be divided so that self-\npolicing is relatively ineffective. Policing organisations are also likely to be \nineffective, not least because the community\u2019s distrust of them renders them unable to \ngather the intelligence needed to maintain order in the area. In this situation, police \nreform on its own cannot be adequate to solve the problem. What must happen \nsimultaneously are processes that raise the quality of the community\u2019s self-policing \nand processes that transform policing organisations into networks of self-regulating \nteams. The prospects for such a development depend crucially on strategic political \ndecisions about the development and resourcing of such communities. \n \nProcesses that improve self-policing can be broadly characterised as involving \nactivities of community development in a wide sense. This includes building forms of \nhuman and social capital, collective efficacy, resilience, capacity, self-help, etc. These \nprocesses all involve the building and strengthening of co-operative interaction. For \nthe maintenance of social order, key styles of such interaction are civility and \nsociability (Misztal, 2000). The relationship between such styles and high-crime, low-\ntrust communities, however, is complex and little understood. It is possible, for \n                                                 \nTP\n17\nPT Note that the term \u2018policing agencies\u2019 does not just mean police forces but includes a range of other \nbodies with a policing function, particularly local authorities (e.g. social services, education, \ndevelopment control, trading standards, environmental health, etc), housing organisations and, \nincreasingly, private security firms. \n 12\nexample, that levels of civility and sociability might actually be quite high in such \ncommunities \u2013 notorious gangsters might act quite civilly to one another and \nsociability can be very strong not only within a criminal gang but also between gang \nmembers and their local community \u2013 while at the same time members of different \ngangs are shooting and murdering one another. In this case, \u2018low trust\u2019 characterises \nthe relationship between community members and policing organisations, and \nbetween gangs, but not relationships within certain sections of the community (gangs, \ntribes, elites, in-groups, cliques, etc).TPF18FPT At the other extreme, it is possible that levels \nof civility and sociability might be very low in a low-crime, high-trust community, \nwhere people \u2018keep themselves to themselves\u2019 but are very trusting of policing \norganisations.TPF19FPT  \n \nConsequently, each community has to be assessed individually in order for it to be \npossible to select appropriate plans of community development action \u2013 that is, to \ndecide whether to focus more on improving civility and sociability (e.g. with an \nemphasis on things like garbage, faeces, noise, public drinking and forming \ncommunity groups) or on correcting forms of \u2018false\u2019 civility and sociability such as \nthose associated with organised criminal activity and structural inequality (see \nSomerville, 2009). A significant complicating factor here is that undertaking such \nassessments and planning requires participation by appropriate individuals and \norganisations (not only policing organisations) from outside the community. A variety \nof expertise, for example, is required for such an undertaking \u2013 in such fields as \neconomic development, housing, healthcare, family support, social regeneration, \nneighbourhood management and planning, open space and recreational management, \ntransport planning and management, etc. \n \nProcesses affecting policing organisations are concerned centrally with how such \norganisations can be transformed from quasi-military or paramilitary hierarchies into \ndecentred non-hegemonic networks. In terms of the three lines of accountability, this \nmeans a downgrading of upwards accountability and a correspondingly increased \nemphasis on horizontal and downwards accountability. As with public self-policing, \nhowever, it is not sufficient to rely on the self-regulation of policing organisations. \nHorizontal self-regulation, for example, through professional codes of ethics and \nquasi-judicial procedures, has never been proved to provide adequate protection for \nservice users from discrimination and abuse or to protect the public from \nmalpractices.TPF20FPT All three lines of accountability therefore need to be retained, but \nupwards accountability needs to be not so much to senior policing officials as to \nproperly constituted democratic bodies who are responsible for making the laws that \npolicing organisations enforce and for monitoring and scrutinising their \n                                                 \nTP\n18\nPT Contrast this with the so-called \u2018broken windows\u2019 scenario, which assumes a positive relationship \nbetween, on the one hand, incivilities and social disorganisation and, on the other, high crime and low \ntrust. \nTP\n19\nPT It follows that, for the purposes of policing, the degree of social and cultural homogeneity or \nheterogeneity of a community is less important than the forms of interaction that occur within the \ncommunity and between its members and representatives of organisations from outside it.   \nTP\n20\nPT This is particularly true in the case of the police where officers have long been recruited, trained, \npromoted and socialised in terms of what has been seen as their primary function of public ordering \nand security on behalf of the state, requiring specific law enforcement skills (Brogden and Nijhar, \n2005, p 77). \n 13\nimplementation.TPF21FPT Such bodies exist on a number of geographical scales \u2013 not only \nnational but also local and regional (and, in the case of Europe, continental). Each \ndecentralised policing team could then be answerable to a local democratic authority, \nand networks of policing teams could be accountable to higher democratic authorities.  \n \nIn a high-crime, low-trust scenario, because of the greater priority attached to crime \nfighting and traditional law enforcement and the greater difficulty of accounting for \ntheir actions to the public, policing organisations will tend to rely more on \naccountability upwards. Police officers on the ground will be given little discretion to \nact as they see fit, and bureaucracy will exist only above and not at the street level. In \nthis scenario, policing is likely to fail unless and until trust is developed between \npolice and public, and developing such trust requires policing organisations to work in \nnew ways, e.g. building contacts and networks with key figures in the community, \nshowing public commitment to a broad spectrum of community development activity, \nand learning to understand the community\u2019s own policing priorities.TPF22FPT \n \nDownwards accountability of police organisations to the public is to be achieved \nprimarily through processes of a third kind, which couple policing organisations with \npublic self-policing. This coupling is structured through relatively stable cooperative \ninteraction at a number of different levels \u2013 strategic, tactical and individual. At each \nlevel, there are processes of joint decision-making and coordinated action. For \nexample, at an individual level, members of policing organisations will interact with \nmembers of the public in a variety of ways such as receiving telephone calls, \nencounters while patrolling, conducting inquiries, participating in meetings, etc. At \nthis level, decisions are mostly made by the individual members of policing \norganisations (the street-level bureaucrats) but coordination is achieved, for example, \nwhere police respond to crime reports, where problems are jointly identified and \nfollowed up, or where members of the public actively cooperate with police \ninvestigations. At a tactical level, neighbourhood or beat policing teams might work \nwith local community groups on a variety of community building and community \nsafety issues. At this level, there is more scope for joint decision-making though it is \nlikely that most activities will be more accurately characterised as consultation and \njoint learning. At a strategic level, policing organisations might work within multi-\nagency partnerships involving a variety of public, private and voluntary sector \norganisations. At this level, joint decision-making processes are more predominant \nbut at the same time communities are likely to be a more junior partner in such \nprocesses. Overall, even this relatively sketchy analysis suggests that the structural \ncoupling of public self-policing with self-organised but democratically accountable \npolicing organisations is likely to be a complicated, uncertain, unpredictable affair. A \nnew breed of professional worker is required, capable of responding flexibly to \ndifferent sets of circumstances, upholding the law yet also serving the community. \n \nIt is important to note that street-level bureaucracy or co-policing is distinct not only \nfrom traditional law enforcement but also from the Chinese \u2018mass line\u2019 principle \n                                                 \nTP\n21\nPT The key guiding principle here, both for self-policing and for policing organisations, is compliance \nwith the letter and spirit of the law, particularly as it relates to fundamental democratic citizenship \nrights. \nTP\n22\nPT In such communities, the police are forced to operate in a different way, e.g. through the use of \nprofessional witnesses, the provision of witness support and protection programmes, etc. (Flint, 2006), \nall of which is time-consuming and expensive, and does not produce results in every case. \n 14\n(Wong, 2000, p 13). According to this principle, \u2018mass struggle and self-criticism, not \nlegal norms and judicial process, is used in ordering society\u2019 (Wong, 2000, p 17, \nreferring to Brady, 1982), \u2018all correct leadership is necessarily \u201cfrom the masses, to \nthe masses\u201d.\u2019 (Wong, 2000, p 17), and: \u2018The police and the people are not separable\u2019 \n(Wong, 2000, p20). The problem with this principle is that it blurs the boundary \nbetween public self-policing and policing by policing organisations, resulting in a loss \nof due process (e.g. the practice of show trials) and the violation of human rights. \nWhat needs to be remembered is that, although the police are also members of the \npublic, their role as police officers is different from their role as citizens. Not only are \nthe systems of public self-policing and policing organisations distinct, but their \ndistinctness is necessary if the public is to be protected from itself. \n \nJust because the police as law enforcers need to be set apart from the public, this does \nnot mean that they should be above the public. Unfortunately, the realities of social \ninequality are such that the police generally provide a better service to more powerful \nsections of the public \u2013 i.e. while not being above the public as a whole, they do \nappear to be positioned above certain groups, who tend to be poorer, non-white, etc. \nSuch injustice cannot be corrected through police reform alone, but only through a \nwider redistribution of power and resources. Fair community policing cannot be fully \nachieved until such redistribution occurs. This is a major point concerning the \npolitical feasibility of achieving ethical community policing, which needs to be \ndeveloped in a separate article. \n \nConclusion \n \nThis paper has attempted to clarify a number of ideas that are relevant for community \npolicing. First, it explored the nature of public self-policing, an idea that was \noriginally outlined by Jane Jacobs. The idea needs further work but at the heart of the \nargument is the principle that the public can, should and does police itself in a variety \nof ways that are still not well understood. Nevertheless, we understand enough to say \nthat public self-policing has inherent limitations, in that it assumes the existence of \nhigh levels of trust, stable social relations, mutual acceptance of social statuses, and a \ngeneral expectation of law-abiding behaviour. Where such features are absent, there \narises a need for policing organisations of different kinds suited to the relevant \ncommunities. \n \nThis finding leads naturally to a discussion of community policing, understood as \npolicing by an organisation that is distinct from the community yet gives high priority \nto interaction with the community. The paper therefore went on to evaluate the \nevidence on community policing, mainly from the perspective of the effect of such \npolicing on the community. This also seems to be unfinished business, as it turns out \nthat community policing remains largely untried, in that high priority is almost never \ngiven to the community. In most areas in most countries, whether they be \u2018close to the \ncommunity\u2019 or not, the police remain a law unto themselves. \n \nThe paper then attempted to make sense of this by conceptualising community \npolicing as a form of street-level bureaucracy. By juggling multiple accountabilities \n(to their bosses, to the law, to their colleagues and to the public), police officers, like \nother street-level bureaucrats, are able to turn many potentially unfavourable \nsituations to their advantage. This is not necessarily a bad thing, for example, in a \n 15\ncontext where there are high levels of trust between the officers and members of a \npublic that is policing itself well. In other contexts, however, it is problematic, being \nlikely to result in neglect and abuse, by both police and public. The last part of the \npaper, therefore, considered how such problems might be tackled or prevented. The \nnature of the problems needs to be specified as clearly as possible (again, further work \nis required here), but it is expected that there will be particular emphasis on forms of \ncommunity development, encouraging communities to become more effectively self-\npolicing, together with radical reform of policing organisations to make them capable \nof structurally coupling with the emergent forms of public self-policing. Needless to \nsay, perhaps, this is not what happens at the moment. \n \n 16\nBibliography \n \nBallintyne, S. and Fraser, P.
