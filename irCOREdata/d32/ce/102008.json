INTRODUCTION\nHexagons are a very common planform arising in pattern-\nforming systems. The asymmetry between the centres and\nthe edges of the hexagons leads to a favoring of hexagonal\npatterns in situations where there is intrinsic asymmetry,\nsuch as in Be\u00b4nard-Marangoni convection @1\u20133# where the\ntop surface of the convecting layer is free and the bottom\nsurface is in contact with a rigid boundary. Most natural\nsystems will have some degree of asymmetry, and hence\nhexagons are widely observed, not only in convection ex-\nperiments, but also for example in vibrated granular layers\n@4,5# and during directional solidification @6#. Triangular pat-\nterns are more unusual, but are seen in some systems, such as\nvibrated granular layers @5#.\nCross and Newell @7# pioneered a method of describing\nthe behavior of a fully nonlinear roll pattern in an extended\nsystem by following the evolution of the local phase, and\nhence the wave vector, associated with the roll pattern as it\nvaries in space and time. This method was further developed\nby Passot and Newell @8# who regularized the Cross-Newell\nequations outside the region of roll stability, introducing an\norder parameter equation to account correctly for the behav-\nior of the pattern in regions where the amplitude is small.\nThe purpose of this paper is to apply ideas similar to those\nof Cross and Newell @7# and Passot and Newell @8# to the\nevolution of fully nonlinear hexagonal and triangular pat-\nterns in large aspect ratio systems, such as those seen in\nexperiments on Rayleigh-Be\u00b4nard convection in SF6 near the\nthermodynamical critical point @9#.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II presents a\nmethod of deriving the Cross-Newell equations for triangles\nand hexagons in a general real gradient system. The Cross-\nNewell equations for particular complex gradient systems are\nderived in Sec. III for hexagons and Sec. IV for triangles.\nThe case of free hexagons and triangles is discussed in Sec.\nV, and the general nongradient case in Sec. VI. Section VII\nconcludes and indicates some directions for future investiga-\ntion.\nII. DERIVATION OF THE CROSS-NEWELL EQUATIONS\nIt is assumed that fully developed hexagons or triangles\ncan be described by a stationary solution w5w0(x) of anPRE 611063-651X\/2000\/61~3!\/2506~7!\/$15.00equation wt5Lw1Nw , where L and N are linear and non-\nlinear operators respectively, at least one of which is differ-\nential, with variational structure such that\nE dx dy wt52E dx dy dGdw , ~1!\nwhere w and G(w) are real.\nHexagons and triangles are described by three wave vec-\ntors k1 , k2, and k3 forming a resonant triad such that k1\n1k21k350. In the case where the governing equations\nforce this resonance to be maintained, the pattern can be\ndescribed using two phases u1 and u2 associated with two of\nthese wave vectors k15\u0093u1 and k25\u0093u2. For fully nonlin-\near triangles and hexagons, the hexagon amplitude and the\ntotal hexagon phase a5u11u21u3 ~where k352k12k2\n5\u0093u3) are determined adiabatically from the two phases u1\nand u2 except in the vicinity of defects where the amplitude\nis small or when the driving stress parameter of the system is\nclose to the critical value for pattern formation so that the\namplitude is small everywhere. In the \u2018\u2018free\u2019\u2019 case discussed\nin Sec. V, where the resonant triad may be broken, the hexa-\ngon amplitude is slaved to the three independent phases u1 ,\nu2, and u3, except when the amplitude is small.\nIn a large aspect ratio system, the size and orientation of\nthe hexagons will typically change slowly in space and time.\nTo describe these changes, it is convenient to introduce large\nscale phases Q15eu1 , Q25eu2, where e!1 is the inverse\naspect ratio of the box, and slow space and time scales X\n5ex, T5e2t . The local wave vectors are then given by ki\n5\u0093xu i5\u0093XQ i , i51,2.\nThe hexagon solution is now considered to be a function\nof the two phases u1 and u2 and the slow space and time\nscales, such that w[w(u1 ,u2 ;X,T). Hence the space and\ntime derivatives of w are given by\n\u0093xw~u1 ,u2 ;X,T !5~k1]u11k2]u21e\u0093X!w~u1 ,u2 ;X,T !,\n~2!\n] tw~u1,u2;X,T !5~eQ1T]u11eQ2T]u21e2]T!\n3w~u1,u2;X,T !. ~3!\nTo leading order then the following equations hold2506 \u00a92000 The American Physical Society\nPRE 61 2507CROSS-NEWELL EQUATIONS FOR HEXAGONS AND TRIANGLESwt5e$Q1T~]u1w0!1Q2T~]u2w0!%, ~4!\ndw5~]u1w0!du11~]u2w0!du2 . ~5!Substituting all this information into the governing equation\n~1! and averaging over u1 and u2 gives, to leading order in e ,eE dx dy$Q1T~]u1w0!1Q2T~]u2w0!%$~]u1w0!du11~]u2w0!du2%52E dx dy ]G\u00af\n]k1\n2 dk1\n21\n]G\u00af\n]k2\n2 dk2\n21\n]G\u00af\n]~k1\u0095k2! d~k1\u0095k2!,\n~6!\nwhere an overbar denotes the average.

Hence the stability boundaries and modes of\ninstability can be found as in Refs. @10# and @11#. Direct\nnumerical integration of the Cross-Newell equations could\nalso be used to determine the region of stable hexagons and\ntriangles, and comparison could be made with the stability\nregion for regular hexagons found by other numerical meth-\nods as in @12#.Ideally the governing equations should be real, as as-\nsumed here, in order to allow the formation of disclinations\non an individual set of rolls @8#. However, there do not ap-\npear to be simple examples of real governing equations\nwhich give fully nonlinear hexagons or triangles as an exact\nstationary solution, and so in order to make further explicit\nanalytical progress we shift our attention in the following\nsection to complex governing equations which do indeed\ngive hexagons. This is perhaps less of a handicap than it\nwould be in the case of rolls, since the canonical hepta-penta\ndefect of hexagons is made up of dislocations, which can be\ndescribed by a complex order parameter.\n2508 PRE 61REBECCA B. HOYLEIII. CROSS-NEWELL EQUATIONS FOR HEXAGONS\nWith slight modifications to the spatial derivative terms,\nthe standard complex amplitude equations for hexagons\n@13,14# can be used as the basic governing equations, giving\n]zi\n]t\n5lzi1azi11* zi12* 2buziu\n2zi\n2g~ uzi11u21uzi12u2!zi1\u201e2zi , ~12!\nwhere l , a , b , and g are real constants, and where * de-\nnotes complex conjugation. The hexagon solutions are rep-\nresented by w5Re(z11z21z3), zi5Rieiu i, with i51,2,3\nand cyclic. Here the usual spatial derivatives have been re-\nplaced by \u201e2 in order to preserve the isotropy of the system.\nThere is a Lyapunov functional associated with the am-\nplitude equations, given by\nL52l~ uz1u21uz2u21uz3u2!2a~z1z2z31z1*z2*z3*!\n1 12 b~ uz1u41uz2u41uz3u4!1g~ uz1u2uz2u21uz2u2uz3u2\n1uz3u2uz1u2!1u\u201ez1u21u\u201ez2u21u\u201ez3u2, ~13!\nsuch that\n]zi\n]t\n52\ndL\ndzi*\n. ~14!\nThere are wave vectors associated with the phases according\nto ki5\u201eu i as before. A hexagonal or triangular pattern arises\nwhen the sum of the three wave vectors is zero, i.e. k11k2\n1k350. Hence the total phase ( iu i[a(t) is a function of\ntime only.\nThe fully nonlinear hexagonal solution takes the form w\n5R1 cos u11R2 cos u21R3 cos u3 where\n05R1~l2k1\n2!1aR2R3 cos a2bR1\n32g~R2\n21R3\n2!R1 ,\n~15!\n05R2~l2k2\n2!1aR3R1 cos a2bR2\n32g~R3\n21R1\n2!R2 ,\n~16!\n05R3~l2k3\n2!1aR1R2 cos a2bR3\n32g~R1\n21R2\n2!R3 ,\n~17!\n05a sin a , ~18!\nhold, and where the Ri are nonzero constants. Clearly if a is\nnonzero, as assumed in this section, the total phase a must\ntake the value 0 or p . If a is zero, a can take any value.\nIn the case of nonzero a , there are only two independent\nphases, which without loss of generality are taken to be u1\nand u2. The third phase u35a2u12u2 is then dependent,\nsince a is fixed.\nAs in the previous section, it is assumed that the wave\nvectors vary slowly in space and time, so that it is possible to\ndefine large scale phases Q i5eu i and long space and time\nscales such that \u0093x5k1]u11k2]u21e\u0093X and ] t\n5e(Q1T]u11Q2T]u2). The solution is expanded in the form\nz[(z1 ,z2 ,z3)5z01ez\u02dc11e2z\u02dc21\u0095\u0095\u0095 , where z0 is the fully\nnonlinear hexagon solution above.To leading order, the Lyapunov functional for the fully\nnonlinear hexagons takes the form\nL52l~R1\n21R2\n21R3\n2!22aR1R2R3 cos a1 12 b~R1\n41R2\n41R3\n4!\n1g~R1\n2R2\n21R2\n2R3\n21R3\n2R1\n2!1k1\n2R1\n21k2\n2R2\n21k3\n2R3\n2\n. ~19!\nSince k11k21k350 holds, k32 can be rewritten k121k22\n12k1\u0095k2, and it is clear that the Ri , a and L all depend only\non k1\n2\n, k2\n2\n, and k1\u0095k2. Hence the variation dL in the\nLyapunov functional is given by\ndL5\n]L\n]k1\n2 dk1\n21\n]L\n]k2\n2 dk2\n21\n]L\n]~k1\u0095k2! d~k1\u0095k2!. ~20!\nIt is also clear that\ndL5\n]L\n]zi*\ndzi*1\n]L\n]zi\ndzi52\n]zi\n]t\ndzi*2\n]zi*\n]t\ndzi ~21!\nholds.

In\nparticular, it is not to be expected that the condition k11k2\n1k350 will be maintained over long times.\nFor hexagons which remain everywhere exactly hexago-\nnal, such that uk1u5uk2u5uk3u5k and R15R25R3[R , the\nphase equations also take the form ~69!\u2013~71!, since the size\nand orientation of a hexagon can then be determined from a\nsingle wave vector, as in the roll case. However, this con-\nstrains the hexagons to behave as a rotating, shrinking, or\nexpanding lattice, which is clearly not a realistic model for\nmost experiments.\nVI. FLUX-DIVERGENCE FORM AND THE GENERAL\nNONVARIATIONAL CASE\nThe Cross-Newell equations ~8! and ~9! for hexagons and\ntriangles in gradient systems are in flux-divergence form,\nwhich has consequences for defect formation, as in the case\nof rolls @8#.

Since the wave\nvectors are gradients of the phases, it is clear that \u00933k1\n5\u201e3k250 also hold, and that \u201e2Q15\u201e2Q250. The so-\nlutions of these equations are the harmonic defects cata-\nlogued in @8#. Despite being energetically unreasonable, and\nhence looking somewhat unphysical, because they contain\nfeatures at wavelengths which lie outside the stable region,\nthey provide a good illustration of the topology of real de-\nfects.

CONCLUSION\nThis paper has derived the Cross-Newell equations for\ntriangles and hexagons in a general real gradient system. The\nresulting equations can be put into flux-divergence form, in-\n2512 PRE 61REBECCA B. HOYLEdicating that the topology of defects of such a hexagonal\npattern can be described by that of harmonic defects @8#. The\ngeneral nonvariational case, however, is not flux divergent.\nIn both cases, the phase stability boundaries and modes of\ninstability for general distorted hexagons and triangles can\nbe recovered from the Cross-Newell equations.\nAn explicit analytical form for the Cross-Newell equa-\ntions is found for both hexagons and triangles in the case\nwhere the governing equations are generalizations of the cor-\nresponding complex amplitude equations.\nThis work suggests avenues for further investigation. In\nparticular, it would be interesting to analyze the Cross-\nNewell equations in a general nonvariational system, andalso to integrate the phase equations numerically in order to\nmake a comparison with an integration of the full governing\nequations, for example in order to compare the regions of\nstability of hexagons. A further interesting possibility is to\nuse the Cross-Newell equations to investigate the simulta-\nneous occurrence of up- and down-hexagons @15#. These av-\nenues will form the basis of future work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Alan Newell and Thierry\nPassot for interesting and helpful discussions.
