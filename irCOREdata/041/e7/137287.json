Driver group differences in simulated driving performance are discussed with reference to the implications \nfor driver training assessment and skill development.  \n \nKeywords: Driving behaviour, driving simulator, hazard perception, driver training \n \n \nIntroduction \nThe effectiveness of driver training on road safety is a controversial issue. Early research has demonstrated \nimprovements in accident risk (Anderson, Ford and Peck, 1980) but many more studies report no significant \ndifference in crash risk post-training (Kaestner, 1968; Nichols, 1970; and Struckman-Johnson, 1989; Manders \nand Rennie, 1984; Lund and Williams, 1985). Whilst there may be some evidence for an initial improvement, \nroad safety effects are not always long-lived (Stock, Weaver, Ray, Brink and Sadoff, 1983). Even specific skills \ntraining such as skid control and braking techniques have failed to find measurable improvements in slippery \nroad accident rates (Lynam and Twisk, 1995; Gregersen, 1991; Katila, Keskinen, Hatakka and Laapotti, 2003).  \nWhen considering the road safety benefits for accident-involved drivers, still no significant reduction on crash \ninvolvement post training has been found for at risk groups (Brown, Groeger and Biehl, 1987; Stuckman-\nJohnson, Lund, Williams and Osborne, 1989). Several studies have suggested that higher order skills such as \nhazard perception contribute more to reducing crash risk than advanced driving skills and knowledge per se \n(Lyman, 1995; McKenna and Crick, 1992) and greater emphasis on hazard awareness may improve the effect of \n 3\ntraining on road safety (Gregersen, 1995). Other studies suggest that accident reductions are possible provided a \npackage of safety measures is in place (Gray 1990; Gregersen, Brehmer and Moren, 1996).  \n \nWhilst one of the goals of driver training is to improve road safety, reduction in accident rates may not be a \nreliable indicator of driver training effectiveness.  Firstly, there are well-established problems in the reliability of \naccident records that lead to difficulties in using accident rates as a criterion measure (Wahlberg, 2003). \nSecondly, an accident may be the result of several events that might be due to factors not considered during the \ndriver-training course under study.  Thirdly, accident frequency is an unreliable criterion given the fact that \naccidents are comparatively rare events when considering the prevalence of everyday risk taking.  Perhaps a \nmore fruitful avenue would be to consider whether post-test professional driver training leads to reduced risk \ntaking behaviour which may ultimately improve road safety whilst not necessarily influencing individual \naccident risk.  \n \nPolice driver training provides a good model for studying the effects of professional driver training especially \ngiven that it often forms the basis of many post-test driver training courses in the UK. Police driver training \nfollows core course texts including \u2018Roadcraft: The Police Drivers Handbook\u2019 involving 3-5 weeks of \nclassroom-based and in-vehicle instruction and leads to a written theory test and driving test. Police drivers are \ntrained either to a standard or advanced level with both courses based on The System of Car Control outlined in \nRoadcraft.  'The System' emphasises observation and focuses on road cues to potential hazards.  Observation is \nseen as particularly critical for the development of high speed driving skills. There is also an element of off-road \ntraining dealing with skid recovery, understeer, oversteer and general manoeuvring. The advanced course is \nlonger and designed to equip police drivers with the skills required to drive in pursuit situations in far higher \npowered cars, or to drive in firearms based situations. Overtaking is also a primary focus, using the increased \nobservational skills already established.  Trainees are trained to overtake by observing the road ahead for layout, \nroad signs, hazards and any obstruction to their view and then identify a safe gap before initiating an overtake.  \nTrainees then observe speed and the position of vehicles behind them, and move up close to the vehicle ahead, \npull out to facilitate good observation and accelerate past the vehicle if there are no hazards. During training \ngeneral driving skills such as positional techniques are also introduced, in particular straddling the centre white \nline when there is no opposing traffic in order to minimise effects of kerbside pot-holes at speed and to allow \nbetter positioning and observation on entry to a bend.  \n \n 4\nGiven these specific driver training instructions, it is expected that police drivers in comparison to non police \ntrained drivers will exhibit different simulated driving performance during overtaking, in lane positioning choice \nand at particular hazards. \n  \nMethod \nParticipants \nFifty-four male police drivers were recruited as volunteers from two large UK urban Police Services via \nnewsletter, website and direct contact.  The average age was 36.7 (SD = 5.7).  They had held a full driving \nlicence on average for 18.4 years (SD = 6.1). A group of 56 non-police trained drivers were recruited via \nopportunity sampling.  The average age was 34. 3 (SD 8.4).  The non-police trained driver group had held a full \ndriving licence on average for 15.6 years (SD = 8.4) and were paid for their participation.  \n \nTable 1 here \n \nDesign \nAll participants were asked to take part in a driving simulator-based experimental trial in which they were \nrequired to drive at their preferred speed along a scenario partitioned into three sections (but running smoothly \ninto each section without a break in the appearance of the roads presented).  Firstly participants were presented \nwith a \u2018rural\u2019 section, representing single lane country roads with hills and bends with occasional traffic.  \nSecondly a \u2018link\u2019 section, representing a stretch of single-lane, fairly straight, open road, relatively free of traffic.  \nFinally an \u2018urban\u2019 section representing driving through a built-up area, with traffic lights, pedestrians and a \nsingle and dual carriageway with heavy traffic.  A between-subjects design was used with driver group (non-\npolice and police trained drivers) as between-subjects factors. To test for risk taking propensity the participants \nwere required to perform two tasks. Firstly, overtaking a slow-moving bus and secondly following a lead vehicle \nat speed in the urban section. During the following task, participants encountered a parked bus from which \npassengers were alighting, and this hazardous event was selected for detailed analysis.  The main dependent \nvariables selected were scenario completion time (measured as the total number of seconds taken to complete the \nentire simulation from start to finish), speed (measured in mph), lane positioning (measured in metres from the \ncentre line), lane positioning variability (measured in standard deviations from the mean position). For the \novertaking task, overtaking risk is measured as the number of occasions that the driver crossed the roadway \ndivision when there were double white lines indicating \u2018no overtaking\u2019.  For the following task, a measure of \n 5\nlateral separation was recorded (measured as the distance from a parked bus and the driver\u2019s vehicle measured in \nfeet).  \n \nFurther dependent variables were selected for performance on approach to the traffic lights.  At distances of 450 \nfeet, 300 feet and 150 feet from the first set of traffic lights, speed, positioning and positioning variability was \nrecorded and averaged at each of these distances.  The same measures were also recorded and averaged over the \n1500 feet before the traffic lights (the earliest point at which the traffic lights were visible to the participant until \npassed).  Finally, the vehicle\u2019s speed and positioning at the point of passing the traffic light itself were recorded. \nThe scenario was 9.12 miles in length and took about 15 minutes to complete, depending on preferred speed. \n \nProcedure \nThe participants were seated in the driving simulator at a distance of one metre (35 inches) from the screen, \nresulting in an approximate eye-to-screen distance of seventy-five cm (25 inches). The participant viewed the \nroad ahead on a 22-inch visual display unit.  Participants were given a 10-minute practise trial on the driving \nsimulator.  During the practise session they were asked to drive along the road in order to get used to the feel of \nthe simulator and the steering wheel and pedal controls.  Next, participants took part in the experimental trial and \nwere instructed to drive the way they would normally drive and deal with the conditions presented as if they are \nreally happening. Vehicles behind the driver never overtook the driver, although they could be viewed in a rear-\nview mirror. Participants were asked to overtake a slow-moving bus during the link section and to maintain \nvisual contact with a lead vehicle in the urban section without seriously compromising safety.  \n \nThe Driving Simulator \nThe driving simulator was built using the STIsim PC-based interactive driving simulator model 100.  The \nsimulation included vehicle dynamics, visual and auditory feedback and performance measurement system, full \nsized driving controls such as a modular accelerator and brake pedal unit, and speed sensitive steering feel \nprovided by computer controlled torque motor (360\u00b0 steering capability).  The simulator incorporated a high-\nresolution digital-optical control input sensors, an audio amplified stereo speaker set and sound card (sound \nblaster Live PCI) and graphics card (3D voodoo2, 24 MB RAM; resolution: 1024 X 768).  The scenario was \npresented on a 22\u201d VGA colour monitor.  The hardware and software were housed in a frame with a car seat \nbuilt from the dimensions of a Ford Escort car.  The screen update was set to produce between 10-30 frames per \nsecond depending on the complexity of the view, leading to a moderately smooth apparent motion. The road was \n 6\nrepresented within a rectangle that was 1024 pixels wide and 768 pixels high with the screen representing the \nsky above, a speedometer below, and a rear-view mirror in the top left-hand corner.  The simulator displayed \nrealistic three-dimensional scenes at 135\u00b0 field view including pedestrians, buildings, road signs and oncoming \ntraffic.  The participant viewed objects up to 1500 feet away appropriately scaled in size and perspective. \nRelevant road signs and markings were included in the scenario such as speed limit signs, signs warning of \nimpending bends in the road approaching, and double\/dashed white lines in the centre of the road, in accordance \nwith the British Highway code. \n \nResults \nAge, Driving Experience and Driving Exposure \nResults showed that age and driving experience did not significantly differ between the two driver groups (Age: \nt=1.73, D.F. = 97.14, p>0.05; Experience: t=1.95, D.F.=99.86, p>0.05). Drivers\u2019 age was significantly correlated \nwith driving experience (r=0.94, n=110, P<0.001), with increasing age being associated with greater driving \nexperience.   \n \nAnnual mileage (using five tick-box categories ranging from less than 5,000 to over 20,000 miles per annum) \nand driving frequency (using four tick-box categories ranging from everyday to never) were found to differ \naccording to driver group (Mileage: \u03c72 = 12.56, DF=1, p<0.001; Driving Frequency: (\u03c72 = 5.2, DF=1, p<0.05).  \nPolice drivers were more than twice as likely as non-police trained drivers to have driven in excess of 15,000 \nmiles in the last year and were more likely to have reported driving every day when compared with non-police \ntrained drivers (see Table 2 and 3 below). \n \nTable 2 and 3 here \n \nIn the result presented in the following sections, all analysis controls for driving experience via age, given the \nhighly significant relationship between age and driving experience. \n \nDriver Group Differences in Speed  \nOverall scenario completion time (dependent upon preferred speed) was significantly correlated with age \n(r=0.18, n=110, p<0.05) but not with driving experience (r=0.15, n =110, p>0.05) suggesting that age and not \nexperience is associated with speed.  Furthermore, the partial correlation between driving experience and \n 7\nscenario completion time, with the effects of age partialled out, was very small (rtime(experience.age) = -0.05, DF=107, \np>0.05).   Analysis of variance showed that there was no significant difference in scenario completion time \nbetween the two driver groups (F1,107 = 0.3, p>0.05) controlling for age (see table 4 below) with both driver \ngroups adopting similar overall speeds. \n \nTable 4 here \n \nIn an analysis of variance considering driver group and scenario section differences in speed, controlling for age, \nresults showed that there was a significant main effect of scenario section on speed (F2,214 = 6.9, p<0.005).  Post \nhoc test revealed that drivers were significantly slower in the rural section compared with both the link and urban \nsections, and that they were significantly faster in the link section compared with the urban section.  Given that \nthe link section is an open road, in contrast to the speed limit imposed on rural driving and the speed required to \ncomplete the following task in the urban section, these findings were expected.  There was no significant main \neffect of driver group (F1,107 =1.2, p>0.05) or a significant interactive effect of driver group by scenario section \n(F2,214 =0.43, p>0.05) on speed (see Figure 1 below) indicating that both non-police trained drivers and police \ndrivers adopt similar speeds across each section of the scenario. \n \nFigure 1 here \n \nDriver Group Differences in Overtaking  \nFor the link section, drivers were required to drive along an open country road relatively free of traffic and \nhazards and overtake a slow-moving bus.  Chi Square analysis of driving performance for this task shows that \nnon-police trained drivers were significantly more likely to cross the roadway division at potentially unsafe \nlocations when compared with police drivers (\u03c72 = 9.2, DF = 1, p<0.005).  Non-police trained drivers were over \nthree times more likely than police drivers to \u2018pull\u2019 on to the oncoming carriageway when it was potentially \ndangerous to do so. \n \nDriver Group Differences in Lane Positioning and Positioning Variability \n(a) Lane Positioning  \nAnalysis of variance revealed driver group and scenario section differences in lane positioning, controlling for \nexperience (F2,214 = 110.4, p<0.001).  Bonferonni post hoc test revealed that drivers were significantly closer to \n 8\nthe central roadway division in both the rural and link sections compared with the urban section lane positioning, \nand that they were significantly closer to the central roadway division in the rural section compared with the link \nsection.  There was no significant main effect of driver group (F1,107 =3.1, p>0.05) but there was significant \ninteractive effect of driver group by scenario section on lane positioning  (F2,214 =8.3, p>0.001), controlling for \ndriving experience.  Police drivers, when compared with non-police trained drivers, were positioned closer to the \ncentral roadway division to a greater extent in the urban section, compared with the rural and link sections (see \nFigure 2 below). In response to the task to follow the lead vehicle, police drivers are inclined to maintain a more \ncentral position in the road compared with non-police trained drivers. \n \nFigure 2 here \n \n(b) Variability in Lane Positioning \nAnalysis of variance was conducted to consider driver group and scenario section differences in lane positioning \nvariability.  The results showed that there was a significant main effect of scenario section on lane positioning \n(F2,216 = 118.2, p<0.001).  Bonferonni post hoc test revealed that drivers were significantly more varied in lane \npositioning in both the link and urban scenarios when compared with the rural section but there was not a \nsignificant difference in variability between the link and urban sections.  There was no significant main effect of \ndriver group (F1,108 =0.16, p>0.05) but there was a significant interactive effect of driver group by scenario \nsection  on variability in lane positioning (F2,216 =7.1, p<0.005). Non-police trained drivers, when compared with \npolice drivers, demonstrated more variability in lane positioning within the urban section, but police drivers \ndemonstrated more variability in lane positioning, when compared with non-police trained drivers within the link \nsection (see Figure 3 below). \n \nFigure 3 here \n \nDriver Group Differences in Performance at Traffic Lights \nAt the time the first set of lights came into view in the urban section, the participants were taking part in their \nsecond task of following a speeding lead vehicle. The first set of traffic lights was the only one used for analysis \nas subsequent signals were always set to \u2018go\u2019.  The first set of traffic lights appears at the beginning of the urban \nsection located on a single carriageway with heavy oncoming traffic.  Cars to the left and right of the junction \ncan be seen waiting for the lights to change.   \n 9\n \nThere was a significant main effect of distance to the traffic lights on speed (F2,216 = 26.1, p<0.001).  Bonferonni \npost hoc test showed that drivers were significantly faster in the last 150 feet approaching the signal compared to \ntheir speeds at a distance of 300-450 and 150-300 feet from the traffic lights.  There was no significant \ndifference in mean speed for the distance of 450-300 feet compared with 300-150 feet.  This finding can be \ninterpreted as a function of drivers speeding up just before passing the traffic lights.  There was no significant \ninteractive effect of driver group by distance from the traffic lights (F2,216 = 0.3, p>0.05) or a significant main \neffect of driver group (F1,108 = 0.4, p>0.05) on approach speed.  Age and experience were not significantly \nrelated to approach speed (see Table 5 and Figure 4 below). \n \nTable 5 and Figure 4 here \n \nHowever, analysis of variance shows that police drivers were positioned significantly closer to the central \nroadway division at traffic lights compared with non-police trained drivers (t=2.82, DF = 108, p<0.01).  Non-\npolice trained drivers had a mean positioning from the central roadway division of 6.2 feet, compared to 5.7 feet \nfor police drivers, on their approach to the signal (see table 6 below). Age and driving experience were not \nrelated to lane positioning and there were no significant driver group differences in; speed variability, variability \nin lane positioning, or speed when passing the signals. \n \nTable 6 here \n \nDriver Group Differences in Passing the Parked Bus \nDuring the urban section, drivers were confronted with a parked bus from which passengers were alighting and \nstanding at the roadside waiting to cross.  Performance data in response to this hazard showed that mean speed \nwhen passing the bus was not significantly correlated with age (r=-0.05, n= 110, p>0.05) or with driving \nexperience (r=-0.06, n=110, p>0.05).  Despite police drivers passing the bus more slowly (mean = 41.3 mph, SD \n= 11.1) when compared with non-police trained drivers (mean = 45.0 mph, SD = 12.7) this difference was not \nsignificant (t=1.6, DF=108, p>0.05). Lateral separation (the distance between the driver\u2019s vehicle and the parked \nbus) was significantly correlated with both age (r=0.18, n=110, p<0.05) and driving experience (r=0.20, n=110, \np<0.05) showing that increasing age and experience is associated with greater distance from the parked bus.  \nHowever, the correlation between age and proximity to the bus, controlling for driving experience, was not \n 10\nsignificant (r Var. Position(age.experience) =-0.02, DF=107, p>0.05).  There was not a significant difference in proximity \nto the parked bus, controlling for driving experience, between police and non-police trained drivers (F1,107 = 2.3, \np>0.05).  \n \nReduction in speed as drivers approached the parked bus was not significantly correlated with age (r=0.05, \nn=110, p>0.05) or driving experience (r=-0.03, n=110, p>0.05).  However, police drivers significantly reduced \ntheir speed, to a greater extent, when compared with non-police trained drivers, on approaching the parked bus \n(t=3.3, DF=108, p<0.005) (see table 7).   There were no significant driver group differences in speed on \napproach to the parked bus.  \n \nTable 7 here \n \nDiscussion \nIt would appear that professional driver training and experiences affects simulated driving performance with \ntrained drivers demonstrating a potentially safer driving style than untrained drivers. The results showed that in \ncomparison to non-police trained drivers, police drivers exhibited greater caution during overtaking and at a \nparticular hazard. Police drivers also tended to position their vehicle more towards the centre of the lane during \nthe following task and at traffic lights, with the magnitude of the driver group differences in simulated driving \nperformance being quite pronounced for some performance variables. The strategy adopted by the police drivers \nfor the overtaking task mirrors the instruction given on safe overtaking during police driver training. For lane \npositioning variability whilst overtaking, police drivers were repeatedly pulling out behind the slow-moving bus \nto facilitate observation of the road ahead, as they are instructed to do during training. It is therefore not \nsurprising that police drivers also exhibited less overtaking risk than non-police trained drivers. In contrast, non-\npolice trained drivers were observed to be \u2018weaving\u2019 in and out of the lanes of the dual carriageway during the \nfollowing task whilst police drivers maintained a steadier position in the far lane, presumably to facilitate good \nobservation and maintain a clear view of the speeding lead vehicle ahead during the following task.  \n \nHowever, the effects of driver training and experience on positioning in a simulated driving task should be \ninterpreted with caution given that recent research indicates differences in lateral positioning between real and \nsimulated driving.  Blana and Golias (2002) found that in a real driving task, drivers' position their vehicle \nconsiderably closer to the centre of the road and kept a relatively constant distance from the road edge in \n 11\ncomparison to a similar simulated driving context.  They interpreted these findings as an underestimation of risk \nof hitting the road edge, perhaps due to the reduced environmental cues available in a simulator.  However, it is \nthe driver group differences that are of interest here rather than the absolute values discussed by Blana and \nGolias (2002). \n \nThe findings with respect to speed suggest that whilst there is no significant differences in speed choice between \nthe driver groups, significantly more police drivers reduced in response to a pedestrian hazard compared with \nnon-police trained drivers.  This may be due to the specialised observation training when driving at speed to help \nidentify potential hazards. Without this training, non-police trained drivers may have been more focused on the \nstudy\u2019s primary task to maintain visual contact with the lead vehicle during the following task and failed to \nadjust speed at particular hazards.  It is also the case that police drivers compile more mileage and therefore have \nmore experience responding to hazards compared with non-police drivers. Brown (1982) discussed exposure as \ncontributing to driving experience by allowing drivers more opportunity to be confronted with different \nhazardous events. In the present study, police drivers were more than twice as likely to have driven in excess of \n15,000 miles per annum and more likely to report driving everyday compared with non-police trained drivers \neven though there were no significant driver group differences in driving experience (number of years since \nbeing granted a driving licence). Police driving experience will undoubtedly influence driving behaviour and \nmay be responsible for driver group differences in simulated driving performance reported here.  Some police \ndrivers in our sample may have had experience of following a vehicle at speed in a built-up area, whereas non-\npolice trained drivers are unlikely to have had experience of this kind of task.  Further research would need to \nexamine more closely the differential effects of police driving experience and police driver training. \n \nAnderson  (1987) suggests that what is learned with training and practice is not knowledge so much as the use of \nthat knowledge. The findings suggest that skills developed during training may have been retained and practised \nover time culminating in a somewhat different and potentially safer driving style to that of untrained drivers.  \nThe value of a driving simulator to assess the beneficial effects of driver training and experience has been \ndemonstrated. Further research using driving simulators could be particularly useful in facilitating better \ndecisions about the content of driver training and its effect on driving behaviour, rather than attempting to \nobserve the effects of driver training on accident involvement. \n \n \n 12\n \nAcknowledgement \nWe would like to thank the Police Scientific and Development Branch of the Home Office for their support for \nthis research and all the participants for their assistance.
