On two different study visits that were \u2021 1 week apart twenty\nhealthy young adult males consumed either 48 g RS or an energy- and carbohydrate-matched placebo. The supplements were consumed as\npart of standardised breakfast and lunch meals that were of identical portion size on each visit. Blood samples were taken every 30 min for\nthe 7 h intervention period to assess postprandial glucose, insulin and C-peptide levels. Subjective measures of appetite were also taken\nusing 100 mm visual analogue scales. Following the 7 h intervention food intake was quantified by an ad libitum test meal. Participants\nwere then able to consume food and drink freely for the remainder of the day, which was recorded in diet diaries to obtain overall 24 h\nintake. Bowel diaries were also completed on the day of the study and the following day to monitor gastrointestinal effects and tolerance\nof the supplements.\nPostprandial plasma glucose levels were not significantly different between the two supplements; however, following the RS supple-\nment there was a significantly lower insulin response compared with the placebo supplement (P= 0.029). The lower insulin response was\nnot accompanied by a significantly different C-peptide response, although C-peptide: insulin was significantly higher following the RS\nsupplement compared with the placebo (6.69 v. 6.13; P = 0.059).\nPostprandial Insulin Response\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\nAverage\nBaseline\n30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 390 420\nTime (min)\nIn\nsu\nlin\n C\no\nn\nc \n(p\nm\no\nl\/l\n) RS\nPlacebo\n  p=0.029\nC-peptide to Insulin AUC ratio\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\n7.0\n7.5\nRS Placebo\n  p=0.059\nFollowing the RS supplement there was also a significantly lower intake at both the ad libitum test meal (5200 kJ v. 5560 kJ; P= 0.033)\nand over the 24 h period (12 464 kJ v. 13 783 kJ; P = 0.051) compared with the placebo supplement. However, these lower intakes were not\naccompanied by significant differences between the supplements for any of the subjective ratings of appetite. The supplements were\nreported to be well tolerated.\nThe lower insulin response seen in the present study, which was accompanied by a relatively similar glucose response, would suggest a\nbeneficial role of RS in the postprandial insulin response, especially in insulin clearance, as suggested by the higher C-peptide: insulin.\nFollowing the RS there was also a significantly lower energy intake, which if maintained long term could have beneficial implications in\nthe management of obesity. Further studies are required to: determine the mechanisms for the effect on the insulin response and appetite;\nestablish whether the effect on energy intake can be maintained long term; identify whether a similar response is seen in other population\ngroups.\nProceedings of the Nutrition Society (2008), 67 (OCE8), E341 doi:10.1017\/S0029665108000153\n"}
