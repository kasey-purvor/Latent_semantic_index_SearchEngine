At the same time, an ELE innovation management literature has also developed, based on insights from innovation theory and their application, both from outside and within ELE, and concerned with attempting to critically evaluate and inform ELE innovation practice. Thus, using a well-established three-part framework for distinguishing the main stages involved in innovation project management, this review describes and discusses the main features of this body of work. After defining terms and clarifying its scope, it considers what is said about the innovation \u2018initiation\u2019 phase, in terms of innovation causes, characteristics and contexts. It then examines conceptualisations of the innovation \u2018implementation\u2019 stage, by distinguishing main overall approaches, frameworks for identifying and configuring roles, underlying psychological processes, and the use of evaluation techniques. Lastly, the literature relating to innovation \u2018institutionalisation\u2019 stage is analysed. The article concludes by identifying overall trends and areas for further development.

Introduction\n1.1 Rationale\n\u2018Innovation\u2019 \u2013 the attempt to bring about beneficial change (West & Farr 1990: 9) \u2013 has\nbecome a defining characteristic of English language education (ELE) over the last twenty\nyears or so, as a glance at compendiums of activity such as Carter & Nunan (2001) testifies. At\nthe same time, from the second half of the 1980s, a literature has emerged within ELE which\nhas attempted to ally this multiplying rate of change to an understanding of innovation theory\nand practice. As will be seen, much of it has been motivated (i) by evidence that innovation\nin ELE, despite its recent exponential increase, has often been less successful than intended,\nand (ii) as a corollary, by the development of the view that greater effectiveness might be\nachieved by a more informed understanding of the large body of work on innovation which\nexists outside ELE, and how it might be brought to bear on the design and implementation\nof innovations within ELE. It is the purpose of this review to attempt to describe and\ncritically evaluate this literature. This will be done by first of all clarifying the nature\n4 2 2 A L A N W A T E R S\nof the main concepts under focus, indicating the scope of the review, and outlining its\nstructure.\n1.2 Definitions, scope and structure\nThe terms \u2018innovation\u2019 and \u2018change\u2019 can be used as equivalents, both referring, somewhat\nindeterminately, to ideas such as \u2018difference\u2019 or \u2018novelty\u2019. The ELE innovation literature,\nhowever, sometimes reflecting some of the competing definitions and conceptual distinctions\nmade in the wider literature, contains a number of different views on the extent to which each\nof the two terms can and should be distinguished (see e.g. White 1988: 114; De Lano, Riley &\nCrookes 1994: 488\u2013489; Markee 1997: 47; Kennedy 1999a: iv).1 More recently, though,\nLamie (2005: 7), while principally concerned with \u2018innovation\u2019, uses the term \u2018change\u2019 in\nthe book\u2019s title; in Murray (2008a) the terms are used synonymously; and in Wedell (2009:\n1) they are seen as equivalents. In what follows, therefore, the two terms will also be used\ninterchangeably, unless specified otherwise.\nIn terms of scope, it has not been possible, because of the practicalities involved, to include\nliterature written in languages other than English. Space limitations have also meant that,\ndespite the obvious desirability of doing so, it has not been possible to include literature on\ninnovation management concerned with the teaching of languages other than English. The\nitems which have been focused on are therefore those written in English and concerned\nwith the application and development of an innovation theory perspective in relation to\nELE. Of its nature, this literature is related predominantly to English as a foreign language\n(EFL) contexts outside Europe2 and the English as a second language (ESL) context in North\nAmerica. In addition, for the same reason, many of the items with UK authorship, especially\nthose from the 1980s and 1990s, are development aid project-based, and there is relatively\nlittle coverage of \u2018local\u2019 educational change initiatives. Space constraints have also meant that\nreference to the wider literature on educational innovation has had to be confined to the\nparts of it which are shared with the ELE literature.\nThe structure of the review reflects the well-established overall conceptualisation of the\neducational innovation management process found in Fullan (2001b: 50\u201353). In this model\n(see Figure 1), \u2018three broad phases of the change process\u2019 are identified, as follows:\nPhase I \u2013 variously labelled initiation, mobilization, or adoption \u2013 consists of the process that leads up\nto and includes a decision to adopt or proceed with a change. Phase II \u2013 implementation or initial use\n(usually the first two or three years of use) \u2013 involves the first experiences of attempting to put an idea\nor reform into practice. Phase III \u2013 called continuation, incorporation, routinization or institutionali-\nzation \u2013 refers to whether the change gets built in as an ongoing part of the system or disappears. (Fullan\n2001b: 50)\n1 For the sake of clarity, references in this article to work by C. Kennedy are cited as \u2018Kennedy\u2019. References to work by\nD. Kennedy and J. Kennedy are cited with the respective authors\u2019 initials.\n2 However, see Medgyes & Malderez (1996) and Wedell (2009) for studies relating to Central and Eastern European\nsettings; Morrow (2005) for the work of the Council of Europe, especially in connection with the Common European\nFramework; and regarding recent European developments in Content and Language Integrated Learning, see Klippel\n(2008).\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 423\nFigure 1 A simplified overview of the change process (Fullan 2001b: 51).\nThus, the review begins by focusing on the ELE literature relating to innovation INITIATION,\nidentified as consisting principally of parts concerned with conceptualising (i) rationales for\ninnovation, (ii) innovation characteristics, and (iii) innovation contexts. This is followed by a\nsection on the main features of the ELE literature regarding innovation IMPLEMENTATION.\nIt starts by considering the ways in which innovation implementation approaches have been\nconceptualised, i.e., models for attempting to bring about change; it then focuses on how\nvarious types of innovation participants have been distinguished; next, it moves to the parts\nof the literature concerned with conceptualisations of psychological processes in innovation\nimplementation, i.e., the ways in which innovations are typically experienced and perceived\nby those responsible for implementing them, particularly teachers; this is followed by a\nfocus on what has been said regarding evaluation in innovation projects, consisting, first\nof all, of a review of approaches to determining overall innovation impact, and, secondly, a\nconsideration of ways in which the monitoring of innovation development has been attempted.\nThis is followed by the third main section, in which the literature relating to Phase III in\nFullan\u2019s model \u2013 INSTITUTIONALIZATION, a concept often referred to in ELE innovation work\nas concerned with innovation \u2018sustainability\u2019 \u2013 is reviewed. Finally, the review closes with\na further section, in which the overall picture evinced by the earlier parts is delineated,\n4 2 4 A L A N W A T E R S\nand the implications for further research and theorising in ELE innovation management\nconsidered.\nBefore proceeding, however, it is important to also take heed of Fullan\u2019s warning that\nFigure 1\npresents only the general image of a much more detailed and snarled process. First, there are numerous\nfactors operating at each phase. Second, as the two-way arrows imply, it is not a linear process but rather\none in which events at one phase can feed back to alter decisions made at previous stages, which then\nproceed to work their way through in a continuous interactive way. (Fullan 2001b: 50)\nIn what follows, therefore, it needs to be borne in mind that dividing the review into main\nsections corresponding to those in the outer circle in Figure 1 oversimplifies a much more\ncomplex and interactive reality. In other words, as with so many of the concepts and\ntheir application this review is concerned with, the whole needs to be seen as very much\nmore than the sum of the parts. Nevertheless, such an arrangement has the advantage\nof providing a framework which can be seen as mirroring the overall sequence of events\nunderlying the (ELE) innovation management process itself, thus providing a means of\nconnecting the strands of the ELE literature on the topic into a reasonably coherent\n\u2018story-line\u2019, and so, despite its limitations, has been regarded as an appropriate organising\nprinciple.\n2. Innovation initiation\nWall (1996), drawing on Fullan & Stiegelbauer (1991: 50), summarises the concerns which\nthe ELE innovation initiation stage can involve as follows:\nA number of questions need to be asked during this phase, relating to the origin and quality of the\ninnovation, who has access to information, whether there is advocacy from central administration,\nwhether there is teacher advocacy, the role of external change agents, the existence and nature of funding,\nand whether the orientation of the intended users of the innovation is \u2018problem-solving\u2019 or \u2018bureaucratic\u2019.\n(Wall 1996: 339)\nThe ELE literature on the topic can be seen as focusing on two of these areas\nof concern, i.e., (i) the reasons why ELE innovations tend to be advocated, and (ii)\ncharacteristics affecting the quality of ELE innovations. It also encompasses a third\naspect, namely the ways in which contextual variables in ELE innovation activity can be\nconceptualised.\n2.1 Innovation rationales\nKennedy (1988: 336), drawing on the work of Kelly (1980), points out that a primary\nmotivation for successful innovation is dissatisfaction with the status quo. Kennedy (ibid)\nalso observes, however, that the degree of dissatisfaction is rarely spread evenly among the\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 425\nvarious parties involved, and its causes may likewise vary, a situation calling for negotiation\nand compromise in terms of any ensuing innovation. In addition, as Cooper (1989: 34\u201335)\nargues, it is important to distinguish between what may appear to be an immediate and\nobvious source of dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the presence of less overt and tangible\nbut potentially more important overall drivers of change \u2013 ones, for example, of a political,\neconomic or scientific nature.\nA second major dimension in conceptualising rationales for innovation in ELE is to do\nwith impetus for change. Thus, Henrichsen (1989: 3) draws on the typology of social change\npresented in Rogers & Shoemaker (1971: 8) in order to analyse innovation in ELE in terms\nof whether (i) the potential source, and (ii) the recognition of the need for change are internal\nor external to the \u2018social system\u2019. The resulting matrix gives rise to four main types of social\nchange: IMMANENT CHANGE (internal source and recognition of need), SELECTIVE CONTACT\nCHANGE (external source, internal recognition of need), INDUCED IMMANENT CHANGE (internal\nsource, external recognition of need) and DIRECTED CONTACT CHANGE (external source and\nrecognition of need).\nMarkee (1997: 48\u201349) argues that these four types of change form a cline in terms of the\npotential level of innovation adoption they are likely to result in, with the first being deepest,\nthe next two forming an intermediary level, and the fourth typically being the shallowest.\nHe also points out that, although \u2018immanent change\u2019 is the kind most often discussed in\nthe wider literature, it rarely occurs in practice. \u2018Selective contact change\u2019 occurs when, for\nexample, a textbook originally intended for use in one situation is adopted in another, different\none. An example of \u2018induced immanent change\u2019 is documented in Kennedy (1987), where\nthe author, in his role as an external consultant, facilitated insiders\u2019 efforts to innovate in\ntheir own, preferred directions. Henrichsen (1989) sees the US-sponsored English Language\nExploratory Committee (ELEC) project \u2013 which attempted to introduce audio-lingualism into\nthe Japanese educational system during the 1950s and the1960s \u2013 as an example of directed\ncontact change, and argues that, because of its global nature, much other innovation work in\nELE can be similarly characterised, while Markee (1997: 49) sees many ELE development\naid projects as also falling into this category.\nA further conceptualisation of factors affecting large-scale change in ELE in particular,\nones derived mainly from wider changes in educational thinking and practice, is found in\nWedell (2009: 14\u201316):\n1. to enable the national educational system to better prepare its learners for a changing national and\ninternational reality\n2. to make the education system more clearly accountable for the funding it receives\n3. to increase equality of opportunity within society as a whole\n4. to use the announcement of educational changes for some kind of short-term political\nadvantage\nThe last of the items in this list relates specifically to the role of \u2018extraneous\u2019 factors in\nmotivating change in ELE. As Richards (1984: 13) points out, \u2018[t]he rise and fall of methods\ndepends upon a variety of factors extrinsic to a method itself and often reflects the influence\nof fads and fashions, of profit-seekers and promoters, as well as the forces of the intellectual\n4 2 6 A L A N W A T E R S\nmarketplace\u2019 (see also Fullan 2001b: 53). As instances of such factors, Richards mentions\n(inter alia) the effect of an innovation appearing in textbook form, the marketing efforts of\npublishers, and promotion by organisations such as the British Council. Similarly, as argued\nby, for example, Pennycook (1994), Canagarajah (1999) and Holliday (2005), many ELE\ninnovations can be seen as being advocated because of the global hegemonic influence\nof \u2018Anglophone cultural discourse\u2019, i.e., in order to advance the socio-political interests\nemanating from this quarter, rather than because of the benefits that they are claimed\nto provide. Waters (2007, 2009b), on the other hand, see the advocacy of a number of\nother recent innovations, such as the use of non-metropolitan models of English as a basis\nfor syllabus design (Matsuda 2006), as resulting from a \u2018critical theory\u2019-based counter-\nhegemony originating within the ELE professional discourse itself. In all cases, in other\nwords, it seems clear that factors other than purely educational ones also affect the genesis\nof many ELE innovations. It also appears likely that a number of additional factors are\nalso involved, even though the ELE innovation literature tends to have less to say about\nthem, such as the effects of significant changes in organisational structures and personnel\n(Parsons & Fidler 2005; Alderson 2009) and the role of commercial pressures (see section 3.1\nbelow).\nGiven the competing nature of rationales for innovation in ELE, it is appropriate to\nconclude this section with a further extract from the summary in Wall (1996) of what Fullan &\nStiegelbauer (1991: 50\u201356) regard as major issues to do with motivations for innovation\ninitiation:\nFullan states that when an innovation fails, there is a tendency to blame the way it was implemented rather\nthan criticize the idea itself. He insists that the source . . . of innovations should always be investigated\nbefore they are put forward for adoption. Would-be innovators should ask themselves questions like the\nfollowing:\n\u0002 Where did the idea for change come from? From a teacher, or a group of teachers? From an academic?\nFrom a politician?\n\u0002 What was the motivation behind the idea? Was it to solve a problem which practitioners agreed needed\nsolving? To test out a theory? Or to take advantage of opportune funding?\n(Wall 1996: 339)\n2.2 Innovation characteristics\nA second main factor affecting the initiation of innovations in ELE evinced by the literature\nrelates to the design features that innovations can have, and their effects (positive and negative)\non potential for adoption. Several authors (e.g. White 1988: 140\u2013141; Henrichsen 1989: 82\u2013\n86; Markee 1997: 59\u201361) mention the set of innovation characteristics described in Rogers\n(1983), which, on the basis of a study of a large number of different types of innovations,\nwere identified as likely to enhance or reduce the possibility of adoption. In their most recent\nformulation, these characteristics are as follows:\nRELATIVE ADVANTAGE: the degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it\nsupersedes . . .\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 427\nCOMPATIBILITY: the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being consistent with the existing\nvalues, past experiences and needs of potential adopters . . .\nCOMPLEXITY: the degree to which an innovation is perceived as difficult to understand and use . . .\nTRIALABILITY: the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis . . .\nOBSERVABILITY: the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others.\n(Rogers 2003: 15\u201316)\nAll of these features are seen by Rogers to correlate positively with the potential for an\ninnovation to be adopted, except for the \u2018complexity\u2019 factor. A further criterion identified\nby Rogers \u2013 one that is also regarded as correlating positively with potential for adoption\n\u2013 is that of \u2018re-invention\u2019, i.e., \u2018the degree to which an innovation is changed or modified\nby a user in the process of adoption or implementation\u2019 (Rogers 2003: 16; also 180\u2013188).\nHowever, despite its obvious potential relevance to the innovation \u2018institutionalization\u2019 phase\nin particular (see Watson Todd 2006, and section 4 below), this characteristic has not been\ndiscussed in the ELE literature to the same extent as the others.\nHenrichsen (1989: 82\u201386) mentions a number of additional characteristics that ELE\ninnovations may possess, such as Originality (the greater the originality, the lower the potential\nfor compatibility), Explicitness (the more concrete the innovation, in terms of its underlying\nprinciples as well as its practical procedures, the higher the likelihood of adoption), and\nStatus (\u2018association with a higher social level\u2019 (p. 85) and the consequent potential for making\nthe innovation appear more attractive). Kennedy (1988: 336\u2013337) describes the three main\ncriteria that Kelly (1980), on the basis of his research into the implementation of a major\nUK social sciences curriculum reform initiative, found teachers used in order to determine\nwhether a proposed innovation was seen to match their working contexts sufficiently closely.\nThe first such factor was \u2018feasibility\u2019 \u2013 the extent to which the innovation was seen as capable\nof being put into practice. The second was \u2018acceptability\u2019 \u2013 the degree to which the innovation\nwas regarded as compatible with teachers\u2019 educational beliefs and teaching approaches. The\nthird was the amount of \u2018relevance\u2019 the innovation was perceived to have \u2013 i.e., whether it\nwas felt by the teachers to meet the needs of their learners. The greater the perceived match\nbetween all three criteria, the greater the likelihood of the innovation being adopted (and vice\nversa).\nFinally, via a meta-analysis of variables such as those above, Stoller (1994) provides a\nfurther conceptualisation of ELE innovation features affecting potential for success or failure.\nHer survey of innovations in US higher education Intensive English Programs (IEPs) showed\nthat three main Factors pertaining to innovations had the greatest potential to affect their\nadoption. The more prominent the presence of two of these \u2013 the Dissatisfaction Factor and\nthe Viability Factor \u2013 the stronger the likelihood of innovation adoption. The third \u2013 the\nBalanced Divergence Factor (consisting of e.g. Explicitness, Complexity and Originality) \u2013\nwas also found to positively affect potential for adoption IF the overall ZONE OF INNOVATION\nrepresented by the constituent attributes conformed to the Goldilocks Principle, i.e., so long\nas its size was neither too small nor too large, but \u2018just right\u2019. It needs to be borne in mind,\nhowever, that IEPs, of their nature, may have a greater propensity towards innovation than\nother kinds of ELE programmes.\n4 2 8 A L A N W A T E R S\nFigure 2 The hierarchy of interrelating subsystems in which an innovation has to operate (Kennedy,\n1988: 332).\nIn Henrichsen (1989), the ELEC project (see section 2.1 above) is analysed in terms of (inter\nalia) a combination of Rogers\u2019 and his own set of innovation characteristics. Similarly, using\na number of the above criteria, Markee (1997) analyses a range of major ELE innovations,\nsuch as \u2018the notional-functional syllabus\u2019, \u2018the natural approach\u2019 and \u2018task-based language\nteaching\u2019 (TBLT), in order to identify the charcateristics of each of them which can be seen to\neither help or hinder their adoption. Thus, for example, TBLT is regarded as having features,\nin terms of the \u2018feasibility\u2019 and \u2018compatibility\u2019 criteria, which are in some respects potentially\npositive and in others potentially negative, and, as far as its \u2018relative advantage\u2019 in foreign\nlanguage contexts is concerned, largely negative (Markee 1997: 35\u201339). A similar analysis is\nmade with respect to the attributes of the \u2018curricular and teacher innovation\u2019 (CATI) project,\nthe detailed ELE innovation case study which makes up Part II of Markee\u2019s book (see pages\n89\u201393 in particular).\nHowever, despite these and a few other contributions to the ELE literature on the topic\n(such as Bax 2003), there is very little direct or indirect reference to innovation characteristics\nelsewhere in the literature on ELE innovation. Rather, it is all too easy to identify instances\nof ELE innovation projects where lack of success, at least in part, can be associated with\na failure to take this dimension adequately into account, such as those described in, for\nexample, Kouraogo (1987), Henrichsen (1989), Tomlinson (1990), Lamb (1995), Shamim\n(1996), Karavas-Doukas (1998), Li (1998), D. Kennedy (1999), Carless (2002), Nunan (2003)\nand O\u2019Sullivan (2004). Such a state of affairs indicates the need for a greater understanding\nof this aspect of innovation theory in ELE innovation activity.\n2.3 Innovation contexts\nProbably the best-known and most influential overall theoretical framework concerned with\nconceptualising ELE innovation contexts is to be found in Kennedy (1988: 331\u2013334), and\nis shown in diagrammatic form in Figure 2. Each of the arcs in the figure represents a\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 429\n\u2018sub-system\u2019 of the innovation context as a whole. The arcs are seen as being in a hierarchical\nrelationship, \u2018with the outer rings being the more powerful and influencing the inner rings\u2019\n(p. 332). Thus, the \u2018cultural\u2019 sub-system is seen as exerting a strong influence on the nature\nof the \u2018political\u2019 and \u2018administrative\u2019 sub-systems, which in turn shape the nature of the\n\u2018educational\u2019 sub-system, and thus the characteristics of teaching institutions and what\nhappens in the classrooms which they contain (cf. \u2018STEP\u2019 and other similar systems (Bowers\n1994), which attempt to analyse operational environments in terms of scientific, technological,\neconomic, political and other trends).\nThe possibilities for innovation at the classroom level are therefore seen to be determined\nto a great extent by the remainder of the contextual system. Kennedy also argues that if\nan innovation manager is ignorant of the relevant contextual factors, or is aware of them\nbut tries to ignore or change them, then problems are likely to arise, since the innovation\nmay be viewed as not fitting in well enough with existing norms (p. 333) (cf. Rogers\u2019 (2003)\n\u2018compatibility\u2019 characteristic in section 2.2 above). Markee (1997: 9\u201315) provides a particularly\ngraphic illustration of such an eventuality, in relation to a UK ELE development project in\nthe Sudan. Also, the \u2018directed contact\u2019 type of change that tends to predominate in ELE,\nas discussed in section 2.1 above, has probably made it particularly prone to this problem,\nand numerous other examples of lack of fit between the design features of ELE innovations\nand their contexts of implementation can be found in the literature (see e.g. Tomlinson 1990;\nHolliday 1994a; Shamim 1996; Carless 1997; Karavas-Doukas 1998; Li 1998; Hu 2002).\nHowever, Kennedy\u2019s framework is criticised in Markee (1997: 56) for not being value-free,\nfor lending support to cultural stereotypes of learners, and for giving the impression that\nonly the outermost sub-system is \u2018cultural\u2019 in nature. Also, a number of refinements to and\nextensions of the model are discussed in C. Kennedy & J. Kennedy (1996) and J. Kennedy &\nC. Kennedy (1998). In the first (cf. D. Kennedy 1999), drawing on Ajzen\u2019s (1988) THEORY OF\nPLANNED BEHAVIOUR, it is shown that the potential for an innovation to be adopted in a given\ncontext is not simply a function of its prevailing ethos but also of subjective factors relating\nto individual perceptions of self-agency, a perspective illustrated with reference to attempts\nto bring about changes in teachers\u2019 error correction practices and general methodological\napproach (see also section 3.3 below).\nIn J. Kennedy & C. Kennedy (1998), it is seen as important, when analyzing contextual\nfactors, to adopt an \u2018interpretative\u2019 perspective (one based on individuals\u2019 \u2018accounts and\nperceptions of the change processes in which they are involved and the discourse events which\noccur during the period of change\u2019 (p. 457)) and not just a \u2018structuralist\u2019 one (i.e., based on an\nanalysis of roles, relationships, and change processes, resulting in a set of cultural \u2018categories\u2019,\nas in e.g. Hofstede 1991). In other words, the use of both \u2018emic\u2019 as well as \u2018etic\u2019 understandings\nof cultural behaviour is advocated. It is argued that the addition of an interpretative angle can\nreveal important exceptions to the overall picture provided by an exclusively structuralist view.\nThus, for example, as the authors show, the concept of \u2018collaboration\u2019 can be seen from certain\ncultural perspectives to be compatible with a relatively top\u2013down discourse, and classrooms\nin a generally group cooperation-oriented culture can operate an individually-competitive\nmicro-culture. Such an approach would therefore seem to go some way towards answering\nMarkee\u2019s criticisms, i.e., conceptualisation in this area needs to consider what contextual\nfeatures are actually oriented to by \u2018stakeholders\u2019 themselves, and how they interpret them.\n4 3 0 A L A N W A T E R S\nThe importance of attempting to understand innovation contexts from an emic or\n\u2018ethnographic\u2019 perspective is given particular prominence in Holliday (1992, 1994a, b,1996a,\n1999). Thus, for example, Holliday (1994a) argues that (innovation) management \u2018cannot\nprovide answers for WHAT to manage . . . the key area is still lacking: we still do not\nhave enough data about what really happens in the classroom between people\u2019 (p. 10).\nRemedying this lacuna is seen to involve looking not only for the right information within\nclassrooms, but \u2018around\u2019 them as well, particularly in order to identify the values and\npatterns of behaviour of the various types of social groupings which can influence \u2018classroom\nculture\u2019. Such INFORMAL ORDERS (Holliday 1992), i.e., unofficial but actual patterns of\nbehaviour, perceptions and so on, and SMALL CULTURES (Holliday 1996b) (as distinct from\nstructuralist conceptualisations of \u2018large\u2019, national-level cultural tendencies) are seen to\ninclude student, host institution, professional-academic and international education-related\nvalues and norms.\nThus, in Holliday (1994b: 12), a distinction is made between the ethos of two main types of\nELE teaching institutions, those of the \u2018BANA\u2019 variety (located mainly in Britain, Australasia\nand North America) and of the \u2018TESEP\u2019 kind (tertiary, secondary and primary, and state\neducation bodies located throughout the ELE \u2018world\u2019). It is argued that, the former, the\npurpose of ELE is primarily \u2018instrumental\u2019, whereas in the latter it is mainly \u2018institutional\u2019.\nAs a result of these and a number of other mutually differentiating features, the two types\nof institutions are seen to represent alternative \u2018cultural\u2019 tendencies, which influence the\npotential for different kinds of teaching methodologies to be operated in them. Thus, a\nteaching approach which might be regarded as appropriate to a BANA setting is seen as\npotentially problematic in a TESEP one, and vice versa.\nSimilarly, and like their counterparts in other subject areas, ELE teachers are also\nseen to be influenced by their adherence to the values of either the COLLECTIONIST or\nthe INTEGRATIONIST \u2018professional-academic\u2019 paradigms (Holliday 1994a). These \u2018teaching\ncultures\u2019 are regarded as differing from each other in terms of a number of major dimensions.\nFor example, the former is characterised as favouring a pedagogy which is \u2018didactic,\ncontent-based\u2019 and the latter is \u2018skills-based, discovery-oriented, collaborative\u2019 (p. 72). The\nprofessional-academic culture of TESEP teachers is seen as primarily \u2018collectionist\u2019, and that\nof BANA teachers as predominantly integrationist (pp. 73\u201374). However, as acknowledged\nin Holliday (2005: 2\u20134), such distinctions suffer from conceptual and other forms of overlap,\nespecially as a consequence of increasing globalisation, and therefore need to be interpreted\ncautiously, as a means of aiding identification of the specific characteristics of individual\ninstitutions, rather than a ready-made \u2018template\u2019 (Holliday 1994b: 5).\nA further conceptualisation of innovation contexts, this time at the educational \u2018sub-\nsystem\u2019 level, is found in Clark (1987). Drawing on Skilbeck (1982), Clark identifies three\nmain educational \u2018value systems\u2019, namely, CLASSICAL HUMANISM, RECONSTRUCTIONISM and\nPROGRESSIVISM, corresponding to a pedagogical focus on what might be seen as, respectively,\n\u2018input\u2019, \u2018skills\u2019 and \u2018process\u2019. In ELE terms, representative examples of methods associated\nwith each of the systems are, respectively, the grammar-translation approach, the \u2018weak\u2019\nversion of the communicative approach (Howatt 1984: 279), and the natural approach\n(Krashen & Terrell 1988). Successful curriculum renewal is seen by Clark (1987) as dependent\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 431\non (inter alia) achieving an integrated and balanced amalgam of the attributes associated with\nall three tendencies (cf. Finney 2002).\nAnother main contextual variable discussed in the literature \u2013 and, once again, one which\ncontains the seeds for potential innovation conflict \u2013 is that of \u2018organisational cultures\u2019. White\n(1988: 136\u2013139) points out that \u2018[s]chools, as organizations, constitute the major context\nin which innovations will be installed, so it is worth giving some attention to the culture\nof organizations, especially as organizational culture, innovation strategy and models of\ninnovation will probably be interrelated\u2019. Following Handy (1984), White 1988 discusses four\nmain types of organizational \u2018culture\u2019: CLUB or POWER, ROLE, TASK and PERSON. Briefly,\nthe structure of the first resembles a spider\u2019s web, with power concentrated in the hands\nof a central authority figure, and is found in, for example, owner-run language schools.\nThe second is hierarchical in nature, with well-defined sets of roles and responsibilities\ngoverning working procedures. Secondary schools, in particular, are likely to have a structure\nof this kind. The third involves a team-oriented, collaborative, problem-solving structure,\ncentring round a particular job or project. An innovation project team will often be\norganised along such lines. Finally, the fourth type of culture consists of a relatively loosely-\norganised collection of individuals, and involves minimal formality in terms of agreed working\nprocedures. Academic departments in UK and US universities usually have this kind of\nstructure.\nWhite (1988: 137) also points out that \u2018[f]ew organizations are restricted to only one\nculture\u2019, although, it might also be added, one of them usually predominates. In addition,\nvariants may also exist. Thus, for example, an owner-run language school CHAIN may take\non characteristics associated with a role culture. There may also be covert centralising modus\noperandi at work in person-oriented organisational cultures. The categories are therefore best\nseen as heuristics, like others already discussed, out of which more refined, individualised\nconceptualisations can be developed. From an innovation management perspective, White\nexplains that among the corollaries arising from the existence of different organisational\ncultures of these kinds are (i) that innovation is more likely to take place in \u2018task-\u2019 and\n\u2018person\u2019-oriented cultures than \u2018role\u2019-oriented ones, and (ii), that each can be associated with\na preferred innovation \u2018strategy\u2019 (p. 138) (see section 3.1 below). Thus, the potential for conflict\nbetween, for example, the role-based organisational culture typical of educational institutions\nand the task-based culture associated with innovation \u2018units\u2019 is obvious (cf. J. Kennedy & C.\nKennedy 1998: 462\u2013464). The Sudan ELE development aid project described in Markee\n(1997: 9\u201315) also serves as a clear illustration of this problem.\nFinally, Henrichsen (1989: 79\u201394), as part of his HYBRID MODEL of innovation diffusion\n(for a convenient overview, see White et al. 1991: 180\u2013188), identifies a number of additional\ncontextual factors affecting innovation management. First of all, because of the way they\nare seen as likely to affect any further potential innovation efforts, the model includes a\ncomponent concerned with analysing the main contextual ANTECEDENTS of the innovation\nsituation. This \u2018focuses attention on the historical nature and development of these factors\nand reminds reformers of the necessity of investigating them as part of the planning process\u2019\n(p. 79). Then, in the PROCESS section of the model, provision is made for the analysis of\nFactors which Facilitate\/Hinder Change in the innovation context, as they occur Within\n4 3 2 A L A N W A T E R S\nthe Innovation Itself (cf. section 2.2 above), Within the Resource System, Within the User\nSystem, and so on.\nHenrichsen demonstrates how such a system of analysis throws extensive light on the causes\nof failure of the ELEC initiative. The model is also used in Wall (2000: 504\u2013506) (see also\nWall 1999, 2005) to investigate causes of problems in a Sri Lankan ELE innovation testing\nproject, and in Kinzley (in progress), in order to study Chinese undergraduates\u2019 experiences\nin attempting to master new EAP\/study skills in the UK university context. However, despite\nthe Hybrid Model\u2019s sophisticated analytical \u2018machinery\u2019, both the model itself and many of\nits categories do not seem to have diffused throughout the ELE literature in the way they\nmight have (due at least partly, perhaps, to the scarcity and cost of the book in which they\nare described). Also, in overall terms, much the same point can be made with respect to\nmany of the other concepts reviewed in this section. In other words, despite the relatively\nlong-standing and well-developed literature concerning contextual factors in ELE innovation\nmanagement, it can be argued that it is still the case that too much ELE innovation activity\nfails to adequately take its implications into account, as many of the reports in even such\nrecent volumes as Murray (2008b) testify, such as Adamson & Davison (2008), Godfrey\net al. (2008) and Katz, Byrkun & Sullivan (2008), as well as the case studies in Wedell (2009:\nsection 2).\nIn concluding this section it therefore seems worthwhile drawing attention to the overall\nframework provided in Wedell (2003) for attempting to avoid this problem (cf. Wedell 2009:\nsection 3), one which puts accounting for contextual variables at the heart of the ELE\ninnovation initiation process, and links their identification closely to the practical implications\nfor ELE innovation management as a whole. Viewing \u2018ESOL curriculum change as cultural\nchallenge\u2019 (Wedell 2003: 441), it is argued that\nto support teachers through the TESOL curriculum change process planners need to explicitly consider\nthe implications of their plans from two interdependent points of view. Firstly they need to try and\nidentify the degree of cultural shift that the practices implied by the proposed changes will represent for\nmost teachers, and so what sort of support will be needed by whom for how long, to help teachers make\nthe transition. Secondly, they need to consider what imbalances the proposed curriculum changes may\nintroduce among other influential components of the language education system, and so what adjustments\nwill be required, when [sic], to restore balance and so support the introduction of new practices. (Wedell\n2003: 447\u2013448)\nAs a consequence, it is seen as important for \u2018curriculum change planners\u2019 to ask and\nattempt to answer two sets of main questions; firstly,\n\u2022 [W]hat degree of cultural shift do the project objectives as initially articulated imply, and\/or what\nfundamental cultural values might the objectives threaten?\n\u2022 [W]hat specific support might teachers need, to be able\/willing to accommodate such a shift?\nand secondly (and consequently),\n\u2022 [H]ow can teachers\u2019 work in the changed TESOL classroom be supported by other factors which\ninfluence teachers\u2019 working environments?\n\u2022 [W]hat will providing such support imply for the funding, timing and sequencing of the curriculum\nchange process?\n(Wedell 2003: 448)\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 433\nBoth these sets of main questions are subsequently broken down into further, more specific\nones (pp. 449, 451), in order to indicate the level of practical support seen as necessary for\neffective ELE innovation management. Finally, the process as a whole is summed up in an\noverall algorithm entitled \u2018Planning language development projects to support Key Players\u2019\n(pp. 452\u2013453).\n3. Innovation implementation\nThis section of the review encompasses the parts of the literature concerned with attempting\nto put the outcomes of the innovation initiation phase into practice \u2013 the process of innovation\nimplementation.\nFor the sake of clarity, it is divided into several sections, beginning with a review\nof implementation approaches, i.e., overall conceptualisations of implementation process\nmanagement; it then considers the ways in which the \u2018figures in the landscape\u2019 of innovation\nimplementation \u2013 innovation participants \u2013 have been identified; next, the spotlight is on\nhow various psychological processes in innovation implementation have been conceptualised,\nespecially as these can be seen to impact on the teacher, usually the main front-line\nimplementer; the focus then moves on from, so far, an overall concern with trying to answer\nthe question \u2018How might innovation implementation be attempted?\u2019 to the related issue of\ntrying to determine how effective the implementation process has been and how it can be\nadjusted, as necessary, on an ongoing basis, \u2013 in other words, to a consideration of what has\nbeen said regarding methods for the evaluation of innovation impact and about the ways in\nwhich monitoring of innovation development can occur.\n3.1 Implementation approaches\nOn the basis of information in, for example, White (1988), Henrichsen (1989), Markee (1997),\nLamie (2005) and Wedell (2009), Table 1 below attempts to provide an overview of, first of all,\nthe main innovation implementation models that can be discerned, secondly, of the change\nstrategies (Chin & Benne 1970) that can be associated with each of them, and finally, of some\nof the types of ELE innovations that illustrate their application in practice. It should be noted,\nhowever, that, in the interests of clarity, the picture presented is an oversimplification, and in\nreality there will usually be overlap and interaction between its various \u2018cells\u2019.\nWithin ELE, as Markee (1997: 63\u201364) indicates, there has been a tendency for the first\ntwo approaches (A and B) to predominate, with the former being preferred by political\nsystems, and the latter being the \u2018weapon of choice\u2019 of applied linguistics. Both involve an\nunderlying centripetal, dissemination dynamic, the main difference being the more staged,\nsystematic overall structure typically employed by the latter. With reference to approach A in\nparticular, Kennedy (1999b: 1) says: \u2018[t]here seems little alternative to a top\u2013down approach\nwhen changing national systems of education if there is to be an attempt at some form of\nuniformity and standardization in teaching and assessment across schools\u2019, although he also\n4\n3\n4\nA\nL\nA\nN\nW\nA\nT\nE\nR\nS\nTable 1 Models of change, change strategies and ELE innovations.\nApproach Model Associated strategies ELE examples\nA CENTRE\u2013PERIPHERY: The prestige and\/or power\nof the innovation centre influences\/forces the\nadoption of the innovation \u2013 a variation on the R,\nD & D model (see below).\nPOWER-COERCIVE (P-C): The use of\nlegislation and other sanctions to\nforce change to occur.\nRATIONAL-EMPIRICAL (R-E): The use\nof reason and other forms of evidence\nto show the need for change.\nMost reforms initiated by governments, aid\nagencies in developing countries (see e.g.\nMarkee 1997: 9\u201315) and other large,\ncentralised organisations. For illustrations,\nsee e.g. Karavas-Doukas (1998), Carless\n(1999), Goh (1999), Waters & Vilches (2008).\nB RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION (R, D\n& D) (Havelock 1969: 11, 5\u20137): Similar to the\nCentre-periphery model above, but based more\non a process of scientific, systematic working-out.\nP-C\nR-E\nApplied linguistics-promoted approaches,\nfor example, Audio-lingualism, the\nCommunicative Approach, and Task-based\nLearning. See e.g. Henrichsen (1989).\nC PROBLEM-SOLVING (Havelock 1969: 11, 11\u201315):\nMain difference from the other models is that the\ninnovation process centres on the\n\u2018problem-owner\u2019 rather than being controlled\nprimarily by outside agencies\/individuals.\nNORMATIVE\u2013RE-EDUCATIVE (N\u2013R):\nBringing about change through\ncollaborative problem-solving.\nAction research, \u2018appropriate methodology\u2019\n(Holliday 1994a), \u2018exploratory practice\u2019\n(Allwright & Lenzuen 1997), the \u2018reflective\npractitioner\u2019 approach to teacher\ndevelopment (Wallace 1991).\nD SOCIAL INTERACTION (see e.g. Havelock 1969: 11,\n7\u201311): Emphasises the role that social relations\nplay in the spread of an innovation. It thus adds\nthe dimension of social context to the picture\nrather than constituting a further model (Markee\n1997: 62).\nOvertly R-E, covertly P-C, and\nsometimes N\u2013R?\nAny innovation spread by e.g. conferencing,\nassociationism, informal networking,\njournals, books, web-sites, courses, and other\nworkings of the \u2018professional discourse\u2019.\nE LINKAGE: Markee (1997: 68) describes this as a\n\u2018contingency\u2019 view of innovation, i.e., the idea\nthat the best model(s) to use will depend on the\ninnovation situation in question. However,\nHavelock (1969: 11, 17) characterises its essence\nas involving the formation of important reciprocal\nlinkages (channels) between (i) the \u2018user system\u2019\nand the immediate \u2018resource system\u2019, and (ii) the\nimmediate \u2018resource system\u2019 and more remote\nresources (see Figure 3).\nPotentially, an integrated and\nbalanced blend of P-C, R-E and\nN\u2013R.\nSee e.g. Breen et al. (1989), Waters (1997);\nthe CATI project (Markee 1997: Part II),\nGoh (1999); the PELT Project (Waters &\nVilches 2001).\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 435\ngoes on to stress the importance, in such an approach, of the presence at an intermediate level\nof a \u2018change agent\u2019 (see section 3.2 below), i.e., someone \u2018responsible for the implementation\nof the change\u2019 (p. 2); (see also Goh 1999).\nHowever, a good deal of the literature has also highlighted the problems associated with\nboth approaches, especially those of lack of ownership and contextual fit (see e.g. Breen\net al. 1989; Lamb 1995; Shamim 1996; Markee 1997; Karavas-Doukas 1998; Goh 1999;\nO\u2019Sullivan 2004; Godfrey et al. 2008). Both are seen to be based on an \u2018objective\u2019, \u2018one size fits\nall\u2019 view of change, and therefore tending to downplay or ignore the importance of the way it is\nultimately experienced and made meaningful on a subjective basis at the individual and group\nlevels (see Hutchinson 1991; see also Fullan 2001b; Trowler 2003; and section 3.3 below).\nOf the other three, approach C has increasingly formed the basis of numerous relatively\nsmall-scale, local initiatives, particularly well-documented examples being Kennedy (1987),\nBreen et al. (1989), Holliday (1994a), Williams & Burden (1994) and Allwright & Lenzuen\n(1997). It is seen as providing a solution to the main problem inherent in the first two\napproaches, because of its emphasis on the involvement and engagement of the \u2018end-user\u2019 in\nthe development and implementation of the innovation (Lamie 2005: 19\u201320). However, it has\nyet to find favour with larger-scale, regional or national-level educational reforms in the same\nway as approach A, perhaps because of a perceived tendency for it to focus too exclusively on\nonly the \u2018problem-owner\u2019 perspective (Havelock 1969: 11, 13\u201314), in contradistinction to the\nmore top\u2013down style of innovation management typically associated with the organisational\nand national cultures of the former (cf. Markee 1997: 176; Waters & Vilches 2008, and\nsection 2.3 above; but for an alternative approach, which attempts to integrate top\u2013down\nwith bottom\u2013up perspectives, see Wedell 2009: 47\u201353).\nApproach D comprises a multiplicity of communication channels revolving around\nindividuals and groups in loosely-structured social systems. On the face of it, therefore, it is\na relatively \u2018end-user\u2019-based approach to innovation implementation. Nevertheless, it can be\nseen to be subject to pressures and influences from dominant social groups, thus making its\nunderlying dynamic, in reality, a less formal and systematic version of that associated with\napproaches A and B. This process occurs in the ELE field via the workings of the \u2018professional\ndiscourse\u2019 (see section 2.1 above). The tendency, in other words, is for the ELE profession,\nlike any other social grouping, to be configured differentially in terms of power relations, with\nideas flowing in a relatively unidirectional manner from the dominant to the less dominant\ngroups. Therefore, albeit in different ways, ALL of the above approaches can be viewed as\nprimarily one-way in orientation.\nApproach E, on the other hand, can perhaps be seen as the one with the greatest\npotential for bringing about the necessary impetus for large-scale change while simultaneously\nminimising at least some of the problems associated with approaches A and B. Thus, as\nFigure 3 shows, the LINKAGE PROCESS model (Havelock 1969: 11, 16) consists of a focus, in\nthe right-hand circle, via the Internal Problem Solving Cycle in The User System component,\non the identification of problems from the end-user perspective. At the same time, in the left-\nhand circle, via the parallel Simulation of User\u2019s Situation cycle in The Resource System\ncomponent, centralised and \u2018expert\u2019 resources are brought to bear on the attempt to solve the\nusers\u2019 problems. Provision is also made for a similar connection to More Remote Resources\n(e.g. the advice of consultants), in order to further extend the range of possible solutions that\n4 3 6 A L A N W A T E R S\nare attempted. The provisional solutions are then sent to the user system to be tried out and\nevaluated. As a result of the back and forth cycles involving experimentation on the basis of\ndifferent \u2018problem\u2019 and \u2018solution\u2019 messages, suitable innovations are gradually developed and\nrefined.\nFigure 3 The Linkage Process (Havelock 1969: 11\u201316).\nSuch an approach to innovation implementation can therefore be seen as an attempt to\ncombine the use of features associated with approach C with those of A, B and D. Although\nsome indicative examples of its use in ELE innovation projects have been provided in Table 1\nabove, perhaps the best example of its application in ELE is to be found in the coursebook\ndevelopment cycle of major international publishers. As Donovan (1998) explains, such\npublishers are constantly engaged in gathering \u2018market\u2019 information from users of their own\nand others\u2019 products about aspects such as their effectiveness, potential for improvement, and\nso on, as well as keeping a \u2018weather eye\u2019 on trends in applied linguistics. This information is\ncollated and fed back to editors, who then, in collaboration with authors, attempt to revise\nexisting or create new teaching materials which take the users\u2019 feedback into account. The\nresulting drafts are then piloted and the feedback emerging from this process is relayed back\nto the publisher, and, as necessary, a further cycle of adjustment and additional trialling\nis undertaken. The overall success of this approach to innovation implementation can be\ngauged by the high level of market demand for coursebooks which have been developed in\nthis manner. On the other hand, because of the anti-coursebook stance which prevails in\nmuch of the professional discourse (see e.g. Kumaravadivelu 2006), this important feature\nof the ELE innovation management landscape does not receive the attention it deserves, as\nindeed appears to be the case with respect to commercial innovation processes in ELE in\ngeneral.\n3.2 Innovation roles\nIn addition to the type of approach chosen, a further important innovation implementation\nvariable concerns the nature and configuration of the various roles played by those involved\nin the process.\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 437\nThe earliest conceptualisation of this kind in the ELE literature occurs in Kennedy (1988:\n334\u2013336) (though cf. White 1988: 118\u2013119), where the system in Lambright & Flynn (1980)\nfor distinguishing innovation situation roles (one originating from the area of town-planning)\nis described and discussed. As Kennedy explains (p. 334), Lambright & Flynn\u2019s classification\ncomprises the following categories:\nADOPTERS: those who sanction the innovation (e.g. government officials);\nIMPLEMENTERS: those directly responsible for putting the innovation into practice (e.g.\nteachers);\nCLIENTS: those who are intended to be the primary beneficiaries of the innovation (e.g.\nstudents);\nSUPPLIERS: those responsible for providing the resources needed for the innovation (e.g.\nmaterials writers);\nENTREPRENEURS: those with overall responsibility for managing the implementation of\nthe innovation (e.g. \u2018change agents\u2019);\nRESISTERS: those in opposition to the innovation.\nKennedy points out that this framework can be criticised for obscuring the way that roles\ncan overlap (e.g. Implementers and others can also be seen as playing an Adopter role), as\nwell as on the grounds that the Resisters category assumes a win\u2013lose rather than win\u2013win\ninnovation model (pp. 334\u2013335). The second of these criticisms can be seen as particularly\npertinent with regard to the manner in which innovation in much of applied linguistics\noperates, in the sense that the overall strategy frequently appears to be based on a one-sided\npolarisation of academic vs. practitioner views, resulting in outcomes in which the perspective\nof the former dominates \u2013 in theoretical terms, at any rate \u2013 at the expense of the latter (see\ne.g. Waters 2009a, b; cf. Widdowson 1992). This is in contrast to the strategy put forward\nin Fullan 1998, one of attempting to accommodate resistance as a first principle of effective\ninnovation management (see also section 3.3 below).\nHowever, as Kennedy goes on to say, a categorisation of innovation project roles such\nas that of Lambright & Flynn is potentially also very helpful in terms of aiding analysis of\nhow relations and communication between the various parties involved in the innovation\nimplementation process might be optimally configured (pp. 335\u2013336). Thus, he argues that:\nIf, for example, adopters exercise a high degree of control over suppliers and implementers (often the case\nin centralized educational systems), the latter\u2019s freedom to adapt plans and to devise materials appropriate\nto their circumstances may be severely curtailed. This top\u2013down planning approach means that feedback\nfrom clients, if collected at all, is rarely incorporated into revision of materials, and that feedback from\nimplementers is seldom asked for and is not likely to reach upwards to the adopters. (Kennedy 1988: 335)\nLambright & Flynn\u2019s categories can also be used to identify examples in the ELE literature\nof the opposite problem, where role relationships do not appear to have been configured\nclosely enough, and where an excessive degree of responsibility was devolved by adopters\nto implementers, as in cases such as those described in Richards & Pennington (1998),\nCarless (1999) and Waters & Vilches (2008). Also, Wedell (2003: 452\u2013453) (cf. Wedell\n2009: 47\u201353 and section 3), on the basis of an extensive review of the problems caused\nby inappropriate configuration and realisation of roles in ELE innovation projects, provides\n4 3 8 A L A N W A T E R S\nan overall framework for properly linking together and accounting adequately for each of\nthem at all of the main stages in the innovation implementation process (cf. section 2.3 above).\nA further well-established conceptualisation of innovation roles, Rogers\u2019 (1983, 2003)\nADOPTER CATEGORIES (see Figure 4), occurs in several parts of the ELE literature (see e.g.\nWhite 1988: 139\u2013140; Markee 1997: 57\u201358). Briefly, Rogers argues that innovation \u2018adopters\u2019\n(this time in the more generic, everyday sense of the term, rather than in Lambright & Flynn\u2019s\nusage) can be seen as comprising five major categories, each of which is characterised by an\noverall psychological disposition towards innovation, as follows:\n\u2022 INNOVATORS: \u2018Venturesome\u2019 (i.e., those who are characteristically pro-innovation in their\norientation)\n\u2022 EARLY ADOPTERS: \u2018Respect\u2019 (i.e., those whose are regarded by others as being sound\njudges of the value of potential innovations)\n\u2022 EARLY MAJORITY: \u2018Deliberateness\u2019 (i.e., those who have a tendency to adopt a \u2018wait and\nsee\u2019 approach to innovation adoption)\n\u2022 LATE MAJORITY: \u2018Scepticism\u2019 (i.e., those who tend to adopt a critical attitude to the\nvalue of potential innovations)\n\u2022 LAGGARDS: \u2018Tradition\u2019 (i.e., those who have a preference for the status (ante) quo)\n(Rogers 2003: 282\u2013285)\nFigure 4 The Innovation Adoption Curve (from White 1988: 139, based on Huberman 1973).\nDuring the adoption process, those at the beginning of this list typically adopt sooner\nthan those at the end, and, because of the way attitudes vary from one part of the adopter\npopulation to another, the adoption curve therefore takes a \u2018lazy S\u2019 form (Rogers 2003:\n23), as shown. The most significant group in this process are the \u2018early adopters\u2019, since\n\u2018innovators\u2019 tended to be viewed with suspicion by the other categories, whereas a favourable\nattitude towards an innovation by the early adopters tends to be viewed positively by the\n\u2018early majority\u2019, their take-up having a consequent, similar, knock-on effect on the \u2018late\nmajority\u2019 category, and so on. Rogers also indicates that, for innovation adoption \u2018take-off\u2019, it\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 439\nis necessary for a minimum CRITICAL MASS of adopters to exist, i.e., between 10% and 20%\nof the overall population (p. 12).\nIn terms of ELE innovation implementation management, the main implications of this\ncategorisation have been seen to include the following. First, because of the S-shaped pattern\nit tends to follow, adoption of an innovation is unlikely to be rapid in the early stages,\nand therefore innovation management time-scales and expectations need to be adjusted\naccordingly (Markee 1997: 58). Second, especially in the early stages, the most crucial social\ngroup for the innovation manager to attempt to \u2018recruit\u2019 are the potential \u2018early adopters\u2019\n(officials, teachers and others who act as opinion-shapers), because of their influence on other\nadopters (see e.g. Kennedy 1987; Markee 1997; Wedell 2003; Waters 2006; and section 4\nbelow). Third, since it is essential that a \u2018critical mass\u2019 of potential adopters is recruited\nas soon as possible, this argues (inter alia) for the use of \u2018whole-school\u2019 and group-oriented\nteacher development strategies (see e.g. Hutchinson 1991, Goh 1999), rather than the more\n\u2018individualistic\u2019 approach typical of much ELT innovation work (such as \u2018counterpart training\u2019\nvia attending an overseas MA programme \u2013 cf. Richards & Pennington 1998; see also section\n3.3 below).\nA further important body of work on the topic of roles in innovation implementation\nis contained in collections of papers concerned with ELE development aid projects, such\nas Crooks & Crewes (1995) and Kenny & Savage (1997). In the former, McGovern (1995)\nargues that it is important to empower \u2018insiders\u2019 as early as possible in the innovation\ndevelopment process, and that a primary means of doing so is to involve them in carrying\nout the project BASELINE STUDY (see section 3.4 below; cf. Wedell 2009). In a related vein,\nMartin & Balabanis (1995) discuss the innovation project \u2018working party\u2019 concept (illustrated\nwith reference to development of an Egyptian residential teacher training centre), i.e., a small\nmanagement\/development committee of insiders and \u2018outsiders\u2019 who engage in detailed\njoint decision-making, a system which, the authors argue, provides an effective way of getting\nround the lack of consultation and involvement of team members that so often typifies initial\ninnovation implementation. Weir (1995), in the context of innovation project evaluation, sees\noutsider-based project \u2018accountability\u2019 evaluation and insider \u2018developmental\u2019 evaluation as\nnot incompatible: experience gained in carrying out a baseline study in Nepal indicates that\noutsider objectivity and insider understanding can be complementary, and that it is more\nefficient to have insiders do data-gathering (see also Bray & Luxon 1999). Smith (1995) argues\nthat innovation project local COUNTERPARTS usually need more than expertise in subject and\nproject management to be empowered in anything like the same way that foreign change\nagents usually are; typical obstacles to this are cultural, political, linguistic and economic;\nvarious possible solutions to the problem are also discussed, mainly based on adopting a\nproactive stance towards it (pp. 72\u201373). Similarly, Hlew (1995) stresses the importance of\nseeing counterparting as a form of cooperation and collaboration, and that counterpart\ntrainers should have the right interpersonal skills for developing such relationships.\nIn the Kenny & Savage (1997) volume, Smith (1997) discusses the way in which DONORS\nand RECIPIENTS in innovation projects typically have different priorities (cf. Medgyes 1994).\nThus, for donors, these are likely to be, for example, achievement of project objectives,\nvalue for money and overall impact, whereas for recipients, they will usually centre around\nmatters such as day-to-day problem-solving, minimising disruption and expense, and impact\n4 4 0 A L A N W A T E R S\nat the personal level. How these features played out and were dealt with in the context of\na Cambodian\u2013British Centre project is also described. In Murni & Spencer (1997), a useful\ntable for analysing the typical differences between counterpart and CONSULTANT (\u2018change\nagent\u2019) role expectations is provided (see also Hollingworth & Spencer 1997 below). Another\nuseful table is provided in Hall (1997), concerning project roles in relation to project stages.\nA genuinely collaborative approach among stakeholders in terms of flexibility of goals,\nprofessional support and evaluation is seen as crucial for innovation project success.\nThe primary overall contribution made by this part of the literature, then, is the way that\nit highlights the need for the foreign aid project as a vehicle for innovation to be managed\nin such a way that its inevitable \u2018outsiderness\u2019 is taken into account and compensated for as\nfar as possible, particularly by the establishment of close and genuinely collaborative working\nrelations between insiders and change agents. However, despite the examples of good practice\njust described, it seems clear that, unfortunately, the norm in much ELE innovation work is for\nthe differing perspectives of innovators and end users in general to be insufficiently reconciled,\nas many of the case studies investigating lack of success in ELE innovation mentioned above\n(see also Hayes 2000: 135\u2013136).\nFinally, we consider the literature on the ELE change agent \u2013 the person responsible for\nthe overall planning and day-to-day execution of the innovation implementation process\n(cf. Lamie 2005: 19\u201320). McGovern (1995: 14), on the basis of an analysis of an innovation\nproject diary kept by two ELE change agents in the context of a major national basic education\nproject in Nicaragua, concludes that, in addition to expertise in ELE and teacher training,\n\u2018certain types of knowledge and skills which are not typically taught on Masters degrees in\nApplied Linguistics\u2019 were also needed for the change agent role. He sees these as including\ninter-personal skills, an ability to handle project politics, negotiations skills, team-building\nskills, and an understanding of budgeting and marketing.\nHollingworth & Spencer (1997: 7) argue that \u2018training consultants [i.e., inter alia, change\nagents] on educational development projects usually seem to be appointed for their academic\nqualifications and teaching experience without regard to demonstrable training or skill in\nmanaging change\u2019 [my interpolation]. Furthermore, they take the view that \u2018the contribution\nconsultants make will be determined by their skills as change-agents\u2019 (ibid) and that they will\nusually need to attempt to effect change at the systemic rather than just individual level, in\nthe larger rather than solely institutional environment, and in a context where the capacity\nto cope with the change may be lacking. On the basis of their analysis of a number of change\nsituations, particularly in terms of power relations (including some telling examples culled\nfrom the film Sister Act!), the authors go on to conclude that\n[change agents] must be able to devise strategies. For this they need to understand persistence and change\nin human systems. They need to know how to test for commitment and change potential, how to build a\npower base, how to enlist cooperation, and how to overcome resistance. They need an overall conceptual\nscheme of things in which all of the relevant knowledge can cohere, a framework which guides strategic\nplanning. (Hollingworth & Spencer 1997: 79)\nThey then discuss one such strategic planning framework, based on Mason & Mitroff (1984)\nand Capelle (1979), concerned with \u2018how strategic power is obtained in human systems\u2019 (ibid),\nand end by illustrating their ideas by reference to two innovation case studies (pp. 82ff.).\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 441\nKennedy (1997), in the context of discussing the need for teacher trainers to become change\nagents, describes some of the elements of the model of change agent expertise in Buchanan\n& Boddy (1992) (developed originally out of the authors\u2019 research into the management of\nindustrial and commercial information technology innovation projects), and which he argues\ncan be seen as also forming parts of the expertise of the ELE change agent (see also Bray &\nLuxon 1999). The elements in question comprise skill in the handling of three main \u2018\u201cmacro\u201d\nareas\u2019. The first of these is Content, i.e., \u2018expertise in the \u201csubject\u201d or area of the change\u2019 (p.\n129); the second is Control, which \u2018centres round the techniques of management that a change\nagent requires . . . such as budgeting, reporting, planning\u2019 (p. 130); the third area is Process, i.e.,\n\u2018the sorts of interpersonal and political skills required to manage change\u2019 (ibid). To these three\nhe adds a fourth area of his own, which is seen to cut across the first two, namely Technology,\ni.e., expertise \u2018related to technology management, particularly information technology\u2019\n(p. 131). Also mentioned are some of the \u2018subskills or competencies\u2019 (p. 132) which Buchanan\n& Boddy (1992) see as underlying the \u2018macro skills\u2019, such as \u2018skills in problem solving; ability\nto question and be critical; ability to see patterns; high cognitive orientation; analytical\nskills . . . creativity\u2019 (pp. 132\u2013133). The remainder of Kennedy\u2019s paper goes on to illustrate a\nmethod of developing such subskills in relation to the Content area, via an awareness-raising\napproach to developing language knowledge.\nTo sum up. The ELE literature concerned with this area highlights the multiplicity of roles\ninvolved, as well as the complexity of configuring and executing them as effectively as possible\n(cf. White 1988: 118\u2013119). In particular, it is clear that the knowledge and skills required for\nthe crucial role of the change agent extend well beyond a knowledge of the ELE innovation,\nthe area of expertise which, however, appears to predominate among those involved in ELE\ninnovation activity in this capacity. In overall terms, thus, the items in this section help to\nthrow light on the problematic nature of roles in ELE innovation implementation, as well as\nhow some of the potential pitfalls involved might be avoided.\n3.3 Psychological processes in innovation implementation\nAnother important section of this part of the literature is concerned with the psychological\nprocesses experienced by innovation implementers, i.e., those directly involved in attempting\nto put innovations into practice, chiefly teachers.\nAn overall reference point for conceptualisation in this area is provided in Malderez &\nBodo\u00b4czky (1999: 15), where the psychology of the teacher is pictured as akin to the structure\nof an iceberg and the way it interacts with its environment (an outline version of their diagram\nis provided in Figure 5). Professional behaviours make up its visible tip, but these are seen to\ninteract with portions of the psyche which lie below the \u2018surface\u2019 (indicated by the dotted line),\nand which are viewed as comprising conceptualisations of (i) at the \u2018ideas\u2019 level, the teacher\u2019s\nimmediate teaching\u2013learning situation and, more broadly, of the nature of language learning\nand education in general, as well as of (ii) at the \u2018attitudes\u2019 level, everyday perceptions and\nbeliefs about the world at large (the \u2018attitudes\u2019 level). Interaction is also seen to take place\nbetween all these elements and the surrounding educational and socio-cultural contexts.\n4 4 2 A L A N W A T E R S\nFigure 5 The Teacher Iceberg (Waters 2005: 217, based on Malderez & Bodo\u00b4czky 1999: 15).\nSuch a conceptualisation of teacher psychology resonates with the characterisation in\nFullan & Stiegelbauer (1991), as discussed in Karavas-Doukas (1998: 28ff.), of significant\neducational innovation being SECOND-ORDER in nature. Change of this kind involves\nalteration of \u2018the fundamental ways in which organizations are put together, including new\ngoals, structures, and roles\u2019 (Fullan & Stiegelbauer 1991: 29), and is \u2018multidimensional\u2019,\ni.e., encompassing \u2018(1) the possible use of new or revised materials . . . , (2) the possible\nuse of new teaching approaches . . . , and (3) the possible alteration of beliefs (for example,\npedagogical assumptions and theories underlying particular new policies or programs)\u2019\n(Fullan & Stiegelbauer 1991: 39). In other words, the accommodation of change by teachers\nneeds to be seen as involving all the levels of the \u2018iceberg\u2019, as well as their dynamic interplay\n(cf. Kelly 1980 in section 2.2 above, whose three criteria for innovation adoption by teachers \u2013\nfeasibility, relevance and acceptability \u2013 can also be seen as congruent with the three main\nlevels of the iceberg (Waters 2005: 218), and see also Hutchinson 1991 below, regarding the\nrole of \u2018key meanings\u2019 in this conceptualisation).\nThe implications for innovation implementation of such a model of the teacher are further\nreflected in various ways in the following parts of the literature. First, drawing on Ajzen\u2019s (1988)\nTHEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR (TPB), C. Kennedy & J. Kennedy (1996) (cf. D. Kennedy\n1999; Keranen 2008) show how, although teachers\u2019 attitudes towards a teaching innovation\nmay be positive, their willingness to actually implement it may be another matter. This can\noccur because, as the TPB indicates, intentions are a product not only of the relative strength\nof the beliefs which shape attitudes, but also of those which formulate conceptualisations of\n\u2018subjective norms\u2019 and \u2018behavioural control\u2019. The former refers to the extent to which the\nbehaviour in question is seen as likely to meet with the approval of \u2018gate-keepers\u2019 and others in\na teacher\u2019s milieu; the latter comprises perceptions of one\u2019s ability to carry out the behaviour\nin terms of personal ability and the constraints of the environment in which it will occur. As C.\nKennedy & J. Kennedy (1996: 352\u2013353) explain, because of such factors, a teacher may, for\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 443\nexample, espouse favourable attitudes towards exercising greater tolerance of learner error,\nbut fail to translate such views into practice because of a self-perceived lack of alternative\nerror treatment strategies, and\/or out of a concern that institutional authorities, parents and\nothers may disapprove. The understanding of the complexities of implementation psychology\nwhich the TPB perspective provides thus helps to throw light on why innovations which do\nnot appear to show awareness of it typically experience difficulties (see e.g. Young & Lee\n1984; Henrichsen 1989; Lamb 1995; Karavas-Doukas 1998; Carless 2002; Waters & Vilches\n2008).\nBeretta (1992) (see also Markee 1992: 231) discusses the use of two more conceptual\nframeworks which throw further light on the psychological nuances of innovation\nimplementation by teachers. The two systems in question \u2013 LEVELS OF USE and STAGES OF\nCONCERN (Hall & Hord 2001) \u2013 were used by Beretta to analyse aspects of the implementation\nof the well-known Bangalore Project (Prabhu 1987). Briefly, the former distinguishes between\nseveral different levels of innovation implementation behaviour that a teacher may exhibit at\nany given point in the implementation process, varying from, for example, Mechanical Use (a\nrelatively unreflective, \u2018attempting to cope\u2019 use of the innovation), to Renewal (autonomous\nredevelopment of the innovation) (Hall & Hord 2001: 82). In the Bangalore situation, this\nframework indicated more developed levels of use among \u2018non-regular\u2019 teachers (i.e., British\nCouncil staff, teacher trainers and others teaching in the project schools on an occasional\nbasis) than among \u2018regular\u2019 ones (those teaching in the project schools on a full-time basis)\n(Beretta 1992: 253\u2013254).\nThe companion Stages of Concern (SoC) model provides a method for determining the\nkind of affective reaction that teachers may have towards an innovation at any given stage in\nthe implementation process, ranging from, for example, early Management concerns (where\nthe preoccupation is with administrative and logistical aspects of using the innovation) to later\nRefocusing ones (in which attention is concentrated on the potential of the innovation as a\nspringboard for further development) (Hall & Hord 2001: 63). In the context of the Bangalore\nstudy, non-regular teachers consistently had greater early concerns than those of the regular\nones (pp. 254\u2013255) (cf. Lee 2007, in connection with an analysis of the implementation of\nthe Malaysian SMART School Project).\nUse of these two frameworks to analyse behavioural and affective aspects of innovation\nimplementation by teachers therefore helps to show that, in these ways as well, the\nimplementation process as experienced by front-line implementers is typically not a\nmonolithic event, but, rather, can be variable in nature and hedged about with complex\npsychological effects. Clearly, such a perspective once again helps to throw further light on\nthe causes of lack of success in ELE innovations, by highlighting the need for, for example,\ngreater and more differentiated levels of support for teachers in their implementation efforts\n(cf. Wedell 2003, 2009).\nThe discussion of ideas in Blackler & Shimmin (1984) and Marris (1974) (cf. Fullan 2001b:\n30\u201332) in Hutchinson (1991), about how individuals and groups cope with change, provides\nfurther insight into the psychology of teacher responses to the innovation implementation\nprocess. Thus, as Hutchinson explains, significant change tends to be experienced as a\npotential threat to what Blackler & Shimmin call an individual\u2019s KEY MEANINGS, i.e.,\n\u2018schemata\u2019 developed on the basis of various everyday life experiences, and which provide the\n4 4 4 A L A N W A T E R S\npredictability, security and self-worth necessary for coping successfully with daily existence\n(Hutchinson 1991: 20). Individuals\u2019 membership of social groupings are also important in the\ndevelopment of key meanings, as is the way that, in return for the rewards groups provide,\nindividuals will tend to conform to their norms.\nBecause change disturbs the way key meanings are configured, the characteristic response\nis one of resistance, what Marris (1974: 22) calls the CONSERVATIVE IMPULSE, i.e., a desire to\npreserve key meanings in their existing form. Hutchinson (1991: 21) therefore argues that, in\nthe management of innovation, \u2018[p]eople should be encouraged to express their resistance. So\nlong as resistance remains hidden, it remains a problem and a potential threat to the success\nof the change\u2019 (cf. Fullan 1998: 256). This is in contradistinction to much ELE innovation\nimplementation practice, where resistance is often seen in only a negative light, or rationalised\nas due to the failings of teachers (see e.g. Kouraogo 1987; Waters 2009b; Wedell 2009:\nsection 2, passim), rather than its causes and potential remedies taken properly into account.\nHutchinson also argues that \u2018[t]he power of groups to affect individual behaviour is generally\nignored in ELT teacher training, where teachers are by and large trained or retrained as\nindividuals\u2019, and therefore that \u2018[t]he logic of the ideas on group norms argues in favour\nof educating teachers in their normal work groups, i.e. their school, faculty or department\u2019\n(p. 20) (cf. Fullan 1998: 257\u2013258).\nAn additional and closely-related innovation implementation concept is that of the\nTRANSITION CURVE, a representation of which is provided in Figure 6 (Waters 2005: 221;\nsee also e.g. Scott & Jaffe 1990; Bridges & Mitchell 2000).\nFrom this perspective, because of the restructuring of key meanings involved, the\ncompetence of individuals faced with significant change, after some initial fluctuation,\ntypically suffers a steep decline, an experience akin to what Fullan (2001a: 40\u201341) calls\nthe IMPLEMENTATION DIP. The key to moving beyond this stage is the \u2018acceptance\u2019 phase, in\nwhich the individual begins to be reconciled to the inevitability of the change. This is followed\nby a series of steps resulting in rising levels of ability to cope with the change. Typically, these\nbegin with a \u2018testing\u2019 (or \u2018recipe book\u2019) phase \u2013 one associated with a desire for structured\nguidance and other certainties which can help to define as clearly as possible what the new\nknowledge and skills are that are needed for successfully handling the change \u2013 and ends with\nthe \u2018integration\u2019 part of the cycle, when the change has been successfully incorporated into a\nnew, restructured set of key meanings.\nWaters (2005: 222\u2013223) discusses a number of the implications for the management of the\ninnovation implementation process that arise from the nature of the Transition Curve, such as\nthe need to emphasise the continuity between the innovation and existing key meanings. Also,\nmany of the points made in Hutchinson & Hutchinson (1996), about the value of the textbook\nas an \u2018agent of change\u2019 in ELE innovation projects, are of particular relevance to the crucial\ntesting\/recipe book stage of the process, since, by the provision of fully-developed teaching\nmaterials, teachers are more likely to be equipped with the necessary level of detailed and\nexplicit guidance needed to support their efforts to implement new teaching ideas. However,\nthe potential for textbooks to re-skill teachers in this way is in contradistinction to the anti-\ntextbook, \u2018de-skilling\u2019 stance which prevails in much of applied linguistics (see e.g. Allwright\n1981; Kumaravadivelu 2006), notwithstanding reports on the negative consequences of the\nlack of provision of this resource in ELE innovation projects, such as Karavas-Doukas (1998),\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 445\nFigure 6 The Transition Curve (from Waters 2005: 221).\nCarless (1999), Waters & Vilches (2008); cf. Fullan (2001b: 79). White (1988: 114), on the\nother hand, warns against the possibility of \u2018teacher-proof\u2019 materials precluding the level of\n\u2018re-invention\u2019 innovations usually require; however, data in Hutchinson & Hutchinson (1996:\n319) indicate that, in practice, \u2018teachers and learners do not follow the textbook script\u2019.\n3.4 Evaluation\nA further important part of the ELE innovation implementation literature is concerned\nwith evaluation, defined in Rea-Dickins & Germaine (1998b: 12) as \u2018the \u201cPOTENTIAL\u201d\nto make judgements and recommend, to evaluate effectiveness and efficiency and to\ncontribute to curriculum improvement and development\u2019 [original emphasis]. In keeping\nwith this dual characterisation of the concept, we shall look first at literature concerned\nwith the \u2018judgemental\u2019 role of evaluation in ELE innovation projects, and then, secondly, its\n\u2018developmental\u2019 role (p. 13).\nIn terms of the former, Kennedy (1988: 341\u2013342) includes a set of \u2018questions for the\nevaluation of change management in ELT projects\u2019, which can be seen as concerned with\nbroad themes of (i) suitability to context, (ii) communication and commitment, and (iii) the\nweighing up of likely benefits against existing dissatisfactions. Alderson (1992: 281\u2013282)\nprovides a list of areas that can be used as the basis of a retrospective (summative) innovation\nproject evaluation, and Weir & Roberts (1994: 17\u201320), drawing on Sanders (1992: 5\u20136),\npresent a comprehensive listing of possible areas for innovation project evaluation, as well\nas a useful discussion of the attendant issues and problems associated with selecting and\n4 4 6 A L A N W A T E R S\nexamining them.3 Celani (1994: 43\u201347) includes a set of criteria for assessing wider and\nlonger-term impact of innovation projects of a kind that might not have been anticipated at\nthe outset (e.g. effects on the teaching of other subjects, not just English).\nA further major trend in the evolution of criteria for ELE innovation evaluation occurred\nas a result of the introduction of \u2018projectisation\u2019 in development aid projects of the 1980s,\nespecially in the context of those sponsored by the UK Overseas Development Agency\n(ODA).4 This was because of the use of LOGFRAMES in such projects (see e.g. Alderson 1992:\n291\u2013292, 300\u2013302; Weir & Roberts 1994: 13; Markee 1997: 80\u201386), requiring the use of\nclearer and more precise evaluation criteria for guiding project implementation and assessing\noverall impact, through, in particular, the need to include concrete \u2018Indicators of achievement\u2019\nand measurable \u2018Means of verification\u2019 for objectives and outputs.\nHowever, McGovern (1995: 3\u201315), echoing concerns expressed in a number of other\nsources (e.g. Alderson & Beretta 1992; Weir & Roberts 1994; cf. Woodhall 1994), points out\nthat \u2018the project approach\u2019 originated as a device for control of expenditure in infrastructure\nprojects, rather than as a means of diffusing educational innovations. He argues that the kind\nof evaluation criteria it fosters can therefore be criticised for being too short-term and product-\noriented, and that project goals should be less concerned with products and structures and\nmore with impact on people, with the full range of potential stakeholders being taken into\naccount.\nMore recently, a further set of innovation evaluation criteria has been developed in the\nform of the INTERPERSONAL MODEL included in Lamie (2004) and (2005), one developed\nas a result of the research described in the former and by building on ideas in, inter alia,\nAjzen (1988), Kennedy (1988), Fullan & Stiegelbauer (1991) and D. Kennedy (1999). Her\nframework comprises a number of main potential \u2018impact areas\u2019 (i.e., \u2018various internal and\nexternal issues\u2019 (Lamie 2004: 124)) which can affect the likelihood of meaningful innovation\nadoption on the part of the intended end user. The \u2018impact areas\u2019 include \u2018personal attributes\u2019\n(attitudes and confidence), \u2018practical constraints\u2019 (textbooks, class size, etc.), \u2018awareness\u2019\n(knowledge\/understanding related to the innovation), and \u2018training\u2019 (Lamie 2005: 66\u201380).\nThe main value of this evaluation system would seem to be the way that, in a relatively\nconcise manner, it centres on three interlocking concerns, namely (i) the personal qualities of\nthe potential adopters, (ii) the nature of the innovation context, and (iii) the innovation content\nand implementation strategies (cf. Lamie 2005: 56), thus creating a convenient synthesis of\nearlier work.\nThe second main aspect of evaluation in ELE innovation implementation evinced by\nthe literature and referred to earlier is its \u2018development\u2019 function. This, the importance\nof integrating evaluation activity as fully as possible into all aspects of innovation project\nmanagement, is, like the \u2018judgemental\u2019 aspect, also mentioned in Kennedy (1988). Thus, as\nhe points out, evaluation questions of the kind included in his paper and reproduced above\nmight be asked \u2018in order to evaluate a project plan prospectively before implementation\u2019\nand, \u2018since evaluation should be built in throughout the planning process, such questions\n3 Information about, and discussion of, techniques and tools for carrying out innovation project evaluations can be found\nin, for example, White (1988: 148\u2013155), Alderson (1992: 274\u2013304) and Weir & Roberts (1994: part III and appendices).\n4 Now the Department for International Development (DfID).\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 447\ncan also be asked during the project to monitor progress, adjust plans, and provide warning\nsignals of problems ahead (formative evaluation)\u2019 (p. 341). In other words, it is seen as\ndesirable for evaluation to be used to guide innovation project management during the\ninitiation and implementation stages as well, that is, to also have a \u2018formative\u2019, not just a\nsummative role.\nA similar concept is also outlined in White (1988: 148), and subsequently reinforced in\nRea-Dickins & Germaine (1998b). In the latter, on the basis of a review of a number of recent\nevaluation studies, it is concluded that \u2018we have identified a change in evaluation practice in\nlanguage education . . . in the way in which evaluation is currently defined, with a paradigm\nshift evidenced\u2019 (p. 11). Part of this process has involved a greater focus on the \u2018UTILISATION\nfunction of evaluation in professional practice . . . Evaluation is intended to have immediate\nutility for policy shaping and is expected to be influential in short-term decision making\u2019\n(ibid; original emphasis). Detailed illustrations of the use and value of evaluation of this kind\nin ELE innovation projects can be found in a number of the papers included in Rea-Dickins\n& Germaine (1998a), such as Mackay et al. (1998), in papers in Alderson & Beretta (1992)\nsuch as Coleman (1992), and in, for example, Weir & Roberts (1994), Williams & Burden\n(1994) and Markee (1997: 130\u2013134).\nAnother main theme running through this part of the literature is a focus on the potential\nbenefits for innovation project development of maximising \u2018stakeholder involvement\u2019 in\nevaluation activity. Thus, it is argued in, for example, Weir & Roberts (1994), McGovern\n(1995), Weir (1995), Bray & Luxon (1999) (cf. Wedell 2009), that a number of potential\nbenefits in terms of innovation project management can accrue from the involvement of\ninsiders in the form of project evaluation activity known as the BASELINE STUDY. The purpose\nof such a study is to gather information at the \u2018appraisal\u2019 and\/or implementation stages of\nan innovation project in order, for example, to determine its feasibility, to provide a basis for\nlater evaluation of project impact, and to identify appropriate \u2018zones of innovation\u2019 (Stoller\n1994 \u2013 see section 2.2 above) and the means of achieving their realisation. With reference\nto a variety of innovation projects in different parts of the world (Ukraine, Cambodia and\nNicaragua) and using the framework of change agent skills in Buchanan & Boddy (1992: 28)\n(see section 3.2 above), Bray & Luxon (1999: 35\u201338) show how the execution of a baseline\nstudy can lend itself particularly well, through the involvement of project insiders, to their\nacquisition of a wide range of transferable innovation project management skills, as well as\nproviding the basis for subsequent project accountability and development (though see Weir\n(1995: 42) regarding the importance for success in this respect of a number of preconditions).\nIn overall terms, thus, the literature on evaluation in ELE innovation projects evinces,\non the one hand, a gradual development and refinement in frameworks for attempting to\nestablish the overall degree of success of innovations, and also an increasing interest in the use\nof formative evaluation information to monitor and fine-tune (inter alia) the implementation\nprocess, as well as achieve greater involvement and empowerment of project implementers.\nHowever, at the same time, it is clear that a number of recent large-scale ELE innovation\nprojects have lacked well-developed implementation monitoring, feedback and adjustment\nsystems of the kind needed, such as those described in Karavas-Doukas (1998), Goh (1999),\nSakui (2004), Lee (2007), Waters & Vilches (2008) and Prapaisit de Segovia & Hardison\n(2009). It can also be argued that, at a superordinate level, much of applied linguistics \u2013 the\n4 4 8 A L A N W A T E R S\nmajor engine of innovation in ELE \u2013 by virtue of the frequent adoption of a \u2018top\u2013down\u2019,\n\u2018linguistics applied\u2019 stance (Widdowson 1992, 2000) and because of the absence of any major\nmeaningful feedback loop from the practitioner level, lacks the necessary means for properly\nevaluating both the overall and ongoing impact of many of the ELE innovations it proposes.\nIt is thereby locked into a cycle that prevents the development of sufficient professional\nself-reflection (cf. Waters 2009b).\n4. Innovation institutionalization\nWe come finally to the third of the main stages in the model in Figure 1 above, what\nFullan (2001b: 51) terms INSTITUTIONALIZATION (often referred to in ELE circles, as already\nexplained, as a concern for creating innovation \u2018sustainability\u2019), i.e., attempting to ensure that\ninnovations remain in long-term use.\nUnfortunately, it has to be said at the outset that even a brief glance at the literature makes\nit clear that ELE innovation projects have often lacked a number of the elements needed to\nfacilitate institutionalization. Typical examples of the problem include the cases described\nin, for example, Henrichsen (1989), Tomlinson (1990), Markee (1997: 9\u201315) and Richards &\nPennington (1998). For example, a major motivation behind the construction of the Hybrid\nModel (Henrichsen 1989; see section 2.3 above) was to attempt to account, as thoroughly as\npossible, for the distinguishing features of an innovation proposal, on the one hand, and, on\nthe other, for the primary features of the host environment likely to affect its potential for long-\nterm adoption. As Henrichsen (ibid) graphically shows, it was the almost complete failure to\nidentify and take into account such variables which led to the comprehensive lack of success\nof the ELEC effort. Thus, by implication, one of the conditions necessary for sustainability\nof ELE innovations is that they are designed and implemented in such a way that there is as\nthorough an understanding as possible of the factors likely to affect long-term take-up.\nOne element of this kind appears to be the building-in of an overall strategy for fostering\ninnovation sustainability right from the start, instead of attempting to address the issue only\nwhen the initial project implementation phase is complete. Some of the means of adopting\nthe former approach have already been mentioned in the previous section, in connection\nwith the involvement of project insiders, from the earliest point, in project evaluation and\ndevelopment (McGovern 1995; Bray & Luxon 1999; for an equivalent approach, involving\nlater stages of project implementation, see Hall 1997 and Jackson, Piper & Yildiz 1997).\nIn addition, in discussing the Indonesian LAN English Language Training Project,\nMarpaung & Kirk (1997: 247) present a project planning and development framework, based\non Crocker (1987), for taking sustainability into account from the outset. In this approach, a\ndistinction is made between innovation project \u2018order of importance\u2019, on the one hand, i.e.\n\u2022 institutional development\n\u2022 staff development\n\u2022 resource development\n\u2022 program development\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 449\nand a reverse \u2018order of implementation\u2019, on the other, i.e.\n\u2022 program development\n\u2022 resource development\n\u2022 staff development\n\u2022 institutional development\nAs the authors explain (p. 2), quoting Crocker (1987),\nThe importance of each component runs top\u2013down from the list, since those above are, in project terms,\ninvariably necessary (but not sufficient) pre-requisites to achieving objectives in the area immediately\nbeneath. This is easy to forget, given that the order of implementation created by the operational\npriorities of the project invariable runs from the bottom upwards.\nAnd they later say (p. 248):\nIn other words, ultimately a project will be sustainable only if it becomes a formal part of the institution\nin which it is based, and institutional development efforts must be made to ensure that this takes\nplace . . . Program development is probably the category on which the adviser will spend most time.\nBut he or she must always bear in mind that the most important aspect is institutional development which\nenables the long-term sustainability of the project\u2019s activities.\nThis approach, thus, depends on distinguishing between what is \u2018urgent\u2019 and what is\n\u2018important\u2019 in innovation development. Keeping such an overall perspective in mind from\nthe start can be regarded as crucial to achieving the level of institutionalization needed for\nsustainability.\nA further, related aspect of the sustainability issue in ELE innovation concerns the\ndistinction made in Markee (1997: 172ff.) between PRIMARY and SECONDARY innovations, the\nlatter being the additional resources, such as teacher development programmes, which are\nessential for ensuring the institutionalization of primary innovations (such as a new teaching\napproach). An evaluation of Markee\u2019s CATI project indicated that its teaching assistants did\nnot understand the relationship between their involvement in materials development and\ntheir own professional development, and their levels of project \u2018ownership\u2019 were therefore\nlower than desirable (Markee 1997: 164). As a consequence, a number of preliminary steps\nwere taken, involving sharing and detailed discussion of the evaluation information between\nMarkee as project leader and the teaching assistants, resulting ultimately in the creation of\na number of secondary innovations aimed at remedying the problems. For example, the\nposition in the accompanying programme of academic studies of the course concerned\nwith materials development meant that although the teaching assistants \u2018could DEVELOP\nmaterials, they had few opportunities to USE them\u2019 (p. 165; original emphasis). In order to solve\nthis problem, a considerably expanded and re-sequenced materials design component was\nintroduced.\nIt is therefore possible to see that a significant factor in the achievement of innovation project\ninstitutionalization is the adequate provision of \u2018secondary\u2019 innovations. As a corollary, it can\nbe seen as particularly important, when introducing new teaching approaches or materials,\nfor teachers to be provided with opportunities, to paraphrase Markee (1997: 165) above,\n4 5 0 A L A N W A T E R S\nto not only learn about them but to also be supported in actually USING them within the\ntarget teaching context (cf. Wedell 2009: 36\u201337). Although some exceptions can be found\n(e.g. Roberts 1998: 258\u2013275; Tomlinson 1988; Goh 1999; Waters 2006), in general, the\nfocus of teacher learning in ELE innovation projects, especially at the in-service level, has\ntended to be much more course- than school-based (Waters 2002). It is arguable that, as a\nresult, the level of institutionalization of new teaching ideas in such projects, and thus their\npotential for sustainability, has frequently been less than needed. This is in contradistinction\nto the picture evinced by the non-ELE literature (see, for example, Fullan & Stiegelbauer\n1991; Adey 2004; cf. Waters 2002), which records a long-standing recognition of the need for\neducational innovation projects to complement course-based teacher learning with extensive\nschool-based follow-up support, in order to create the levels of institutionalization needed for\nlong-term \u2018ownership\u2019 (cf. Wedell 2003: 453).\nFinally, there is also relatively little said in the ELE innovation literature (but see, in\nparticular, Wedell 2003; Wedell 2009) about the importance for enhancing sustainability\nof recruiting the support of and nurturing close relations with \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 figures, such as\nleading local academics, teacher trainers, educational administrators, senior teachers, heads\nof department, principals, advisers and the like (cf. \u2018early adopters\u2019 in section 3.2 above). Such\npersonnel, because they are involved in influencing the teaching ideas and\/or management of\nthe education and school systems, have the power to make or break the institutionalization of\nan innovation. In general, however, the tendency in a good deal of ELE \u2018stakeholder analysis\u2019\nappears to have been to either ignore or attempt to by-pass such figures (see e.g. Henrichsen\n1989; Tomlinson 1990; Markee 1997: 9\u201315; Richards & Pennington 1998; Godfrey et al.\n2008).\nMore positively, however, Kennedy (1987), in the context of describing the use of a\nmainly \u2018normative\u2013re-educative\u2019 approach to bringing about change (Chin & Benne 1970;\nsee section 3.1 above) in a Tunisian university ESP unit, also discusses the importance of\nensuring the support of the institutional \u2018powers that be\u2019 to the success of such projects, and\ndistinguishes between the involvement of system or institutional managers and others in a\n\u2018power-coercive\u2019 vs. a \u2018supporting\u2019 role. The latter is seen as an essential part of establishing\nthe legitimacy of the change agent to effect change (cf. Buchanan & Boddy 1992: 88).\nSimilarly, Waters & Vilches (2001: 139\u2013140) argue that provision needs to be made in any\nELE innovation project for an \u2018ELT manager\u2019 orientation programme, aimed at encouraging\nintegral involvement of such personnel in the project (though see Waters (2006: 47) concerning\nsome of the problems and practicalities of designing an effective system of this kind).\nThus, in general, the ELE innovation literature shows that institutionalization is more\nlikely to be achieved if (i) the innovation is designed and implemented in such a way that it is\nembedded in the interstices of the host habitus to the greatest possible extent; (ii) strategies\nfor increasing the potential for sustainability are built in right from the outset, rather than\nonly taking the form of post hoc bolt-on extras; (iii) a sufficiency of secondary innovations\nare provided, so that the kind of support needed to achieve the necessary level of in-depth\nunderstanding and ownership by implementers is created; and (iv) system managers are\nrecruited to the cause of the innovation, so that the necessary support for sustainability at\nthis level is also ensured. On the other hand, it is equally clear that, unfortunately, a number\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 451\nof these features have frequently been lacking in ELE innovation projects, resulting all too\noften in lack of long-term success.\n5. Conclusion\nWhat, then, can be concluded in overall terms about the current state of the art of managing\ninnovation in ELE, and what priorities for further development can be discerned?\nFirst of all, it is obvious that there is now a substantial body of literature on the subject, and,\nwith several important book-length publications having appeared in recent years (Lamie 2005;\nMurray 2008b; Wedell 2009), it shows signs, if anything, of gathering further momentum.\nThis has resulted in a reasonably comprehensive coverage of the field. However, at the same\ntime, important lacunae also exist.\nThus, the literature embraces a very wide range of GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATIONS, but there\nare significant gaps in terms of areas such as Latin America, non-Anglophone parts of Europe,\nand, in recent years, the Middle East. Many types of INNOVATION CONTEXTS are covered, at\nall three main educational levels, both in terms of private- and public-sector settings, though\nthe former is represented to a significantly lesser extent than the latter. In terms of TYPES OF\nINNOVATIONS, there are a large number of accounts of attempts to change aspects of teaching\nmethodology and teaching materials, as well as of initiatives concerned with teacher training,\nbut, on the other hand, innovations involving the use of information technology, institutional\nrestructuring and changes in senior personnel in organisations are all under-represented.\nAnd, while coverage of INNOVATION DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT PROCESSES is reasonably wide\nand varied, some areas (such as \u2018levels of implementation\u2019 \u2013 see section 3.3 above) do not\nappear to have diffused as they might.\nAlso, despite some important exceptions, the vast majority of items in the ELE innovation\nliterature are written by native speakers of English, draw on literature from the English-\nspeaking world for much of their academic background, and tend to be associated with native\nspeaker-led innovation experiences. It therefore seems inevitable that the overall picture in\nthis respect is a culturally-biased one. Thus, after outlining the problem-solving, participative,\ninteractive and \u2018learning by doing\u2019 innovation management approach used in the CATI\nproject, one typical of what is advocated in much of the rest of the literature, Markee (1997:\n175\u2013176) points out that\nsuch a model of curricular innovation is very much an artefact of the sociocultural context that gave birth\nto this view of how to manage change. It is therefore quite likely that other models and strategies of change\nmay be culturally more appropriate in contexts of implementation that have more centralized traditions\nof how to manage change. This aspect of the educational change literature is very much underdeveloped,\nand further research is needed.\nAs this review has demonstrated, the situation described by Markee more than 10 years ago\ndoes not seem to have changed a great deal, though a number of important ELE innovation\nstudies by writers with different sociocultural backgrounds from the one that Markee mentions\nhave subsequently been published, such as Karavas-Doukas (1998), Li (1998), Goh (1999),\n4 5 2 A L A N W A T E R S\nHu (2002), Sakui (2004), Lee (2007), Goh & Tay (2008), and, slightly earlier, Shamim (1996).\nClearly, it is important that this trend continues and expands, so that a less potentially\nethnocentrically-biased picture of what is involved in effective ELE innovation management\nis built up.\nThis said, in the situations which they describe, many of the studies just mentioned both\nlament the absence and indicate the potential value of a model of change of the kind referred\nto by Markee. Also, it is clear that, despite the identification of the model with the Anglophone\nwest, actual innovation practice in that part of the world is frequently a different matter, as\nindicated in much of Fullan (2001b). Indeed, in a survey of a large number of Australian\ninnovation project teacher development programmes, Ingvarson, Meiers & Beavis (2005: 17)\nconclude that\n[t]he findings from this cross-program analysis reflect findings from other research on professional\ndevelopment and challenges that policy makers have faced for many years. These studies often find\na considerable gap between the conditions that research indicates are optimal for professional learning\nand those that are provided.\nFurthermore, in Lee (2007: 277\u2013282), it is argued that the drawbacks identified in the\noperation of the Malaysian SMART School Project professional development system came\nnot so much from the operation of an overall top\u2013down innovation strategy, but, rather,\nfrom a failure to ensure that the more \u2018normative\u2013re-educative\u2019 elements (see section 3.1\nabove) which it also included were made to work in the intended manner. Therefore, however\nparadoxically, here the solution to the problem is seen to lie in the direction of a more effective\napplication of centralised leadership (cf. Goh 1999). The overall challenge, therefore, would\nseem to be one of how to create the potential for more effective innovation within systems\nwhich, in all parts of the world, tend currently to operate in ways which make this difficult to\nachieve.\nA further important gap is the one that exists between the body of literature on innovation\nmanagement concepts and practices that we do have, both within and outside ELE, on the\none hand, and the continuing tendency in the literature on ELE innovation activity for much\nor all of this information to be ignored. Out of the 13 chapters in as recent a volume as\nMurray (2008b), and despite their other considerable merits, very few make any kind of\nreference to innovation management concepts of the kind which this review has focused\non. This is of all the more concern, when, as Murray makes clear in her \u2018Introduction\u2019\n(Murray 2008a), the intention has been to show how, on the one hand, certain approaches\nto the management of change result in \u2018predicted outcomes\u2019 being \u2018challenged, reshaped, or\nrejected\u2019, and, on the other hand, how others enable change to be \u2018co-constructed by teachers\nand change agents\u2019 (p. 1). Thus, although gaps exist in the ELE innovation management\nliterature, as has been indicated, and which it is important to remedy, probably the most\nurgent need is for the overall approach to innovation of the ELE professional discourse\nto become much better acquainted with and responsive to the important guidance which,\neven its present form, it is capable of providing. One way this might occur would be if\ntraining programmes and textbooks about ELE were to more frequently include sections on\nM A N A G I N G I N N O V A T I O N I N E N G L I S H L A N G U A G E E D U C A T I O N 453\ninnovation management theory, and its application, in the manner of, for example, White\n(1988).\nThis said, it is also important to be realistic about what can be achieved, and avoid\nsuccumbing to what, to paraphrase Rogers (1983), might be referred to as \u2018pro-innovation\nTHEORY bias\u2019. As Wedell (2009: 5) points out,\n[t]he literature suggests that a virtually infinite set of interdependent variables may affect the extent\nto which, and speed with which a recognizable version of an educational change becomes visibly\nimplemented in (the majority) of classrooms, or indeed whether there is any change at all.\nThere is therefore probably far more that is NOT known about effective innovation in ELE\nthan is currently understood. However, as Wedell (2009) also says, \u2018I believe that a limited\nnumber of more universal human and material variables lie at the core of this infinite set\u2019\n(5). In other words, it seems likely that what we do already understand about the more\ngeneralisable aspects of the ELE innovation management process, if taken into account, can\nmake innovation in ELE more successful than it would otherwise be. This can perhaps be\nregarded as the chief value of the literature which has been reviewed here, and the primary\nrationale for its continuing development.\nAcknowledgements\nI am very grateful to Chris Kennedy, Numa Markee and Ron White, as well as several\nanonymous reviewers, for their very helpful feedback on earlier drafts of this article.
