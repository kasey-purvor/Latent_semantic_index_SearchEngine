Ekin,\nOxford University Press, Oxford, 2006, pp. xxvii + 673. Scope: monograph. Level:\npostgraduate, scientists and engineers.\nWe are fast approaching the centenary of the historic first liquefaction of helium by\nKamerlingh Onnes and his team in Leiden, on 10 July 1908. Helium was the last of what\nhad been called the \u201cpermanent gases\u201d to succumb to the sustained international efforts of\nmany scientists. Their difficulty had been mainly that its liquefaction temperature would\nturn out to be so low. But at about 4K it duly collapsed into a colourless liquid whose\nextraordinary properties would not be properly appreciated or understood for another\nthree decades. One of its oddest features, whose explanation had to await the advent of\nquantum mechanics, is that helium at low pressure does not solidify at all but remains\nliquid right down to the absolute zero of temperature \u2013 unlike every other material.\nIt was the liquefaction of helium that launched low temperature physics as a distinct\nsubdiscipline, and provided a basis for many of the technologies that followed. It enabled\nexperiments to be carried out over a huge range of lower temperatures, in some cases far\nbelow 4K: by pumping on a bath of the common isotope 4He one can reach 1K; pumping\na bath of the rare isotope 3He takes one to 0.3K; appropriate mixing of the two isotopes\n(dilution refrigeration) enables the attainment of temperatures down to 2mK, providing\nthe launching pad for nuclear demagnetization techniques to temperatures a thousand\ntimes colder again.\nIt was quickly discovered that the properties of all materials undergo enormous changes\nas their temperatures are reduced below ambient. For example, thermal contraction occurs\nand continues down to about 50K or lower for some materials. Thermal conductivity can\nrise, or fall, by many orders of magnitude, and often changes nonmonotonically. The\nsame is true of electrical resistance, which can even fall to zero if the conductor enters the\nsuperconducting state. Specific heats must all approach zero at low enough temperatures\naccording to the Third Law of Thermodynamics, but they can exhibit complex behaviour\nbefore they reach the ultra-low temperature range. Phase transformations also occur\nand, around 4K not only water but also air, hydrogen \u2013 and indeed everything except\nhelium itself \u2013 are frozen solids. It is a very different world to the one we inhabit at room\ntemperature. Not surprisingly, enormous care is needed to design cryostats and other\nmachinery and instrumentation to operate at low temperatures.\nJack Ekin\u2019s book has been written to help a wide range of experimentalists, including\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 49, 3 (2008).\ngraduate students, physicists, engineers, material scientists and experienced researchers\nwho need to make measurements or design equipment to function at low temperatures.\nIt tells them how to do it. In his Preface, he says that \u201cThe mantra for this book is that\nit be useful \u201d. Acting on this he describes in some cases how not to do things \u2013 his own\nerrors from the past \u2013 as well as approaches that do work. It is a big book. Its 673 pages\nare divided between 10 chapters, with enumerable figures and tables, covering everything\nthat the practicioner needs to know.\nPart I of the book, consisting of chapters 1\u20136, is devoted to cryostat design. It covers\nthe different types of cryostat used for measurements down to about 1K, how to choose\nthem, how to design and run them, and how to make measurements in them. There is\nextensive discussion of the selection of constructional materials, how heat transfer takes\nplace at low temperatures, soldering, welding, thermal anchoring of measurement leads,\nhigh vacuum techniques, electrical lead-throughs, temperature measurement and control,\nand much else. A lot of physics is included too, but it is brought in as needed to illustrate\nthe practicalities of design. The rest of the book is more specialised. Part II consists\nof just two chapters, and is devoted to the practicalities of making electrical transport\nmeasurements. Again, there is detailed explanation of how to do them including the\ndesign\/selection of sample holders for different purposes and how to make good contacts.\nThe final two chapters comprising Part III cover how to measure and analyse critical\ncurrents in superconductors. There are extensive references and a select bibliography for\neach chapter, and 135 pages of appendices providing essential data about the materials\nneeded for cryostat design.\nAll those involved in low temperature physics or cryogenics can with advantage dip\ninto Jack Ekin\u2019s book. It is the distillation of a lifetime\u2019s experience in cryogenics, and\neven very experienced practicioners will find useful tips and ideas about how to do things\nbetter. Part I especially is quite generally applicable and likely to be useful to a wide\nrange of physicists and engineers interested in measurements down to 1K. It will also\nbe of use to those working at the far lower tempertatures where most of the cutting\nedge work in the discipline is now to be found, given that even state-of-the-art nuclear\ndemagnetization cryostats have much of their structure operating above 1K. Every low\ntemperature laboratory, as well as libraries, will need a copy.\nPeter V. E. McClintock\nLancaster University.\n2\n"}
