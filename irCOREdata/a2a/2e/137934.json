In the pursuit of continual \nimprovement (i.e. reducing energy consumption, better service performance, greater \navailability and improved reliability), implementing wise maintenance schedules is essential \nfor contemporary organisations. Several studies of a wide range of Nigerian industries \nindicate that indigenous low availability and low productivity are endemic. The resulting \nclosure of some of these industries has triggered off a realisation of the strategic challenges in \nmaintenance management. In addition, the contemporary increasingly-competitive business \nenvironment in Nigeria has raised the strategic importance of maintenance functions, \nespecially in organisations with significant investments in physical assets. Five strategic \naspects of maintenance management have been identified, namely: - maintenance \nmethodology; support processes; organisation and work structuring; comparable culture; and \ngeneral management.

It has become \n 2\nevident that any organisation that wishes to achieve rapid, substantial and sustainable \nimprovements in maintenance effectiveness, in other words in physical-asset performance, \nmust act strategically.   \n \nMaintenance actions are dependent on such factors as the plant\u2019s previous downtime history, \nand its expected life. Maintenance should preserve the functions of the assets. With rising \nexpectations, increasingly onerous   regulatory constraints, shifting technological paradigms \nand frequent reorganisations, major corporations have developed formal mission-statements \nto help them maintain a successful course through these many demands. Thus, it is worth \ndeveloping a corresponding commitment to facilitate the maintenance team doing likewise. \nThe mission statement must the recognize needs of all the stakeholders of the maintenance \nservice. Maintenance serves three distinct groups \u2013 the owners of the asset, the users (usually \nthe operators), and society as a whole. Maintenance depends on a range of people \u2013 from \ndesigners of the equipment to its operators.   Thus it is desirable to acknowledge the need for \neveryone involved  with the asset to share a correct common understanding of what needs to \nbe done, and to be able and willing to do whatever is needed  right first time, every time. \n \nIf systems do not fail, maintenance would be superfluous. The technology of maintenance \nincludes finding and applying suitable ways of managing techniques that include predictive \nand preventive maintenance, failure-finding and run-to-failure [1]. Each category includes a \nhost of options: maintainers need to learn what these options are, but they also need to decide \nwhich are worth implementing in their own organisations. If they make the right choices, it is \npossible to improve asset performance, and simultaneously even reduce the cost of \nmaintenance. If they make wrong choices, new problems may arise while existing problems \nget worse, so the mission statement should stress the need to make the most cost \u2013 effective \nchoices from the full array of options. The severity and frequency with which a failure incurs \nadverse consequences dictate whether a particular failure-management technique is worth \napplying. So, the mission statement should acknowledge the key role of consequence \navoidance in maintenance.  The development and execution of a maintenance strategy for an \nindustrial plant consists of three steps [1]: -  \n\u2022 Formulate a maintenance strategy for each asset (i.e. work identification) \n\u2022 Acquire the resources (namely skilled people, spares and tools) needed to execute the \nstrategy effectively \n\u2022 Execute the well thought-out strategy (i.e. deploy and operate the systems needed to \nmanage the resources efficiently).   \nMost of what has been written on maintenance strategy refers to the three basic types namely, \npredictive, preventive and corrective maintenance. However, Moubray [2] adds a fourth, that \nis, detective maintenance. Predictive (or condition-based) tasks entail checking to see if the \nprocess is failing. Preventive maintenance usually means overhauling a system before its \nfailure occurs. Preventive maintenance is divided into time-based and condition-based \nmaintenance. Time-based (according to a fixed time schedule) maintenance is wasteful if no \nfaults exist. Corrective maintenance means fixing or replacing components either when they \nare found to be failing or when they have failed. Detective (i.e. failure-finding) maintenance \napplies only to hidden or unrevealed failures and hidden failures usually only affect protective \ndevices.  \n \nIn spite of the availability of all of the afore mentioned maintenance policies and their \nabilities to prevent failures or restore the system to its operating condition in most situations, \ndeteriorations and breakdowns still occur and associated environmental disasters happen. \nEach maintenance policy has its own limitations and disadvantages. For example, in the case \n 3\nof failure-based maintenance, it is difficult to plan the maintenance activities appropriately: \nthus, the failure of the considered component can cause a large amount of consequential \ndamage to other parts of the system or plant. Time-based maintenance incurs a large financial \ncost for the user in trying to maintain the required level of system reliability, because the \nmajority of items are replaced prematurely, i.e. while they still have a considerable useful-life \nremaining [3]. \n \nIn condition-based maintenance, it may not be cost effective to monitor the condition of every \ncomponent of the system: some will be inaccessible for monitoring. So, it is beneficial not to \ntreat condition-based maintenance as a stand-alone policy, but instead as a part of an \nintegrated maintenance strategy. Consequently, the industry has become aware that a single \nmaintenance policy cannot eliminate all breakdowns or restore the plant to its full operating \ncapability. This awareness gave birth to maintenance strategies like reliability-centred \nmaintenance (RCM) and total productive maintenance (TPM). \n \n(i) RCM determines what must be done to ensure that a physical asset continues to do \nwhatever it was designed to do. A failure of one component may stop a whole plant \nperforming to the standard required by its users. Before any blend of failure-management \ntools can be applied successfully, it is necessary to identify what failures are likely to occur. \nThe RCM process: -  \n\u2022 Identifies what circumstances amount to a failed state.  \n\u2022 Asks what event can cause the asset to fail. \n\u2022 Provides a maintenance-oriented framework to meet the challenges. \n\u2022 Deals effectively with each type of failure process with appropriate maintenance \ntactics. \n\u2022 Improves maintenance productivity by adopting a more proactive, planned approach.  \n\u2022 Extends the run duration between scheduled shutdowns. \n\u2022 Ensures the active support and cooperation of all personnel, e.g. between the \nmaintenance, materials, operations and technical functions. \n \nThe RCM process develops and optimises the effective maintenance programme. \n \n(ii) TPM: RCM is an asset-centred methodology with the primary focus on making decisions \nconcerning the type of maintenance tasks to be used, whereas TPM is a methodology with a \ndifferent orientation - it focuses on people and is an integral part of TQM [4]. TPM \nmethodology was developed initially in Japan\u2019s manufacturing industries, with the aim of \nreducing production losses due to machine breakdowns in JIT production systems. \n \n TPM organises maintenance procedures by applying the following [4]: \n\u2022 Cultivate a sense of ownership in the operator by introducing autonomous operator \nmaintenance i.e. the operator takes responsibility for the primary care of his\/her plant. \nThe tasks involved include routine inspection, lubrication, adjustment, major repairs, \nas well as cleanliness and tidiness of the operator\u2019s workspace. \n\u2022 Optimise the operator\u2019s skills and knowledge of his\/her plant to maximise the \noperating effectiveness. The operator is thus mobilised to detect any early signs of \nwear, maladjustment, oil leak, or loose parts. He\/she is also involved in making \nimprovement suggestions to reduce the losses due to a break-down or sub-optimal \nperformance of the plant. \n 4\n\u2022 Uses cross-functional teams, consisting of operators, maintenance technicians, \nengineers and managers to improve performances of those members and equipment.  \n\u2022 Establish a schedule of clean \u2013up and preventive maintenance to extend the plant\u2019s \nlife-span and maximizes its up-time.  \n  \nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS \n \nIn many industries worldwide, the effects of downtime are becoming aggravated by the \nincreasing adoption of just-in-time (JIT) processes and total quality-management (TQM). \nReduced stocks associated with JIT mean that minor breakdowns   are now much more likely \nto stop or inhibit production. The growth of mechanisation and automation means that \nreliability and availability have become key issues in sectors as diverse as healthcare, electric-\npower generation stations and chemical processing. Thus, during recent decades, the cost of \nmaintenance has risen in absolute terms and as a proportion of total expenditure. In some \nindustries, it is now the largest contributor to the total cost. Maintenance reactions are \ndependent on many factors, such as failure rates of the plant\u2019s components, the associated \ncosts of downtime and the expected lives of critical items of equipment. Maintenance \nstrategies have evolved (in highly industrialised countries) taking into account quality, cost, \nflexible delivery and customer satisfaction. Maintenance is regarded as a proactive profit-\nfocused activity; the aim being to narrow the difference between actual and ideal maintenance \ncosts, i.e. reduce the cost of unreliability. Recent developments [4] are: -  \n \n\u2666 Emerging operational strategies.  The economy-of-scale concept is losing some of its \nadvocates. Increasingly, organisations have switched to lean manufacturing, \u201cJIT \nproduction\u201d and \u201csix \u2013 sigma programmes\u201d. These trends indicate a shift of emphasis \nfrom:- maximum volume output to quick response;  elimination of waste, defect \nprevention; and achievement of higher quality. In increasingly demanding \nenvironments, breakdowns, speed loss and erratic process yields create immediate \nproblems for the timely supply of goods or services to customers.  Thus, installing the \nappropriate equipment and facilities, optimising the maintenance schedules of these \nassets and the effective deployment of appropriately skilled manpower to perform the \nmaintenance activities are crucial factors in fostering these operational strategies. \n \n\u2666 Raised societal expectations. There is a growing acceptance in theory (but too often \nnot in practice) of the need to protect the ambient environment as well as ensure \npeople\u2019s safety and health. In the developed countries, wide ranges of regulations have \nbeen enacted to control industrial-pollution and prevent accidents occurring in the \nwork place. Scrap, defects and the ineffective uses of materials and energy are \nrecognised as sources of pollution. Nevertheless, catastrophic failures of operating \nplant, industrial accidents and health hazards are still far too prevalent. Keeping \nfacilities operating optimally and preventing failures are means of meeting, partially, \nthe ever more demanding societal challenges with respect to reducing pollution, \nemission and accident prevention. These should now be core functions in any \nmaintenance programme, but too rarely are. \n \n\u2666 Technological changes. Technology is a major driver of change. In the electricity-\ngenerating industry, automation systems are being installed to identify and deal with \nfaults in the transmission and distribution network. New technologies are being \ndeployed to enhance the system\u2019s availability, raise the cost effectiveness of all \n 5\noperations and deliver better or innovative services to customers. These present new \nchallenges to maintenance function.  \n\u2666 Changes in personnel attitudes and organisational systems. Most personnel wish to \nimprove their quality-of-life at work. Furthermore, the social and demographic \nchanges that have taken place recently affect how we regard and define work. Two \nexamples of these changes are (i) improvements in pertinent education and (ii) \nincreased faith in the ability of individuals to manage them well in the face of \nadversity. Thus, progressive organisations have introduced less hierarchical \nmanagement structures, self-managing work-teams, virtual organisations and strategic \nalliances. Some of these could be appropriate for meeting today\u2019s challenges of \nproviding improved maintenance services to organisations.  \n \nORGANISATION AND WORK STRUCTURING \n \nTsang [4] concluded that the strategic decisions to be taken with respect to the organisational \ndesign and structuring of maintenance activities include: (i) plant purpose, (ii) workforce \nlocation, and (iii) composition and flexibility of their workforce. The associated decisions \nrequire considering workload characteristics; plant location; cost of non-availability; skills \nand knowledge required; production policy; and human-resources policy. In traditional \nNigerian organisations, the hierarchical management structure is often parochial and highly \nfunctionalised: e.g., engineering is responsible for the design and procurement of new plant as \nwell as the modification of existing systems; production is responsible for operating the plant; \nand maintenance for servicing and repairing it. Furthermore, the maintenance workforce is \norganised into specialised   trades, so resulting in demarcation disputes, lack of cooperation \nand poor operational efficiencies. Although multi-skilling has often been successful in \ncreating a more flexible work-force, experience now highlights that such employees often \nlose the motivation to seek out solutions to basic equipment problems or defects (which, if left \nunchecked, will subsequently cause failures) because they know they will soon be moved to \nanother task or to attend to a different piece of equipment.  A zone-based team approach, \nwhich promotes the development of both base-skills and interdisciplinary-skills, provides a \nmeans to achieve both flexibility of being capable of responding effectively and ownership \n(of the problem) within the workplace. Wisely formed zone-based teams create a learning \nenvironment, where employees recognise the self-benefits of being able to operate, and care \nfor, their equipment [5]. \n \nThe workforce may range from a plant-flexible tradesman, who is responsible for maintaining \nall the plant to a plant-specialized one, who only works on a particular type of equipment. The \nadvantages of plant specialization include improved work-quality and faster responses due to \nthe greater plant knowledge and sense of ownership.   A stronger spirit of teamwork can also \ndevelop. However, this mode of organization will face a major problem when the workload \nvaries considerably from one plant-specialised group to another. In such cases, labour \nutilization will be lower because the workload cannot be balanced by exploiting labour \nmobility. \n \nFlexible trade-groups are usually located centrally or close to their designated zone. The main \nproblem with decentralized plant-specialized groups is that it is difficult to achieve flexible \nlabour movements between trade groups. The knowledge and skills involved determine how \nthe maintenance function is organised. The degree of centralization of the maintenance \nfunction can also be an indication of an assets\u2019 life-cycle.  \n \n 6\nMaintenance work usually requires a range of skills in any operation, although a single skill is \nnevertheless predominant for that operation. If the operation requires (i) special skills and (ii) \nthe workload is relatively constant with respect to time, it is appropriate to adopt trade \nspecialization [4]. \n \nAs a result of the adoption of work structuring, organisations tend to evolve from rigid \nfunctionalism towards task \u2013 based structures. Taylor and Felton [6] provided a theoretical \nbasis for socio-technical system (STS) concepts, e.g. self-managing teams (SMTs). Holodny \nand Stjeinberg [7] proposed the following design principles for establishing SMTs: \n \n\u2022 Team activities are task oriented and designed with a performance focus. \n\u2022 The team is organised to perform whole, integrated tasks. \n\u2022 The team should have some autonomy (that is, control over many of its own \nadministrative functions, such as self-planning, self-evaluation and self-regulation). \nFurthermore, members should participate in the selection of new team-members. \n\u2022 Detailed specifications of tasks, procedures and methods are kept to a minimum. Only \nthose essential for information sharing with outside parties, for scheduling or for \ncoordination are prescribed. Within the team, standards are arrived at through \nagreement about what represent group norms. This flexibility allows the team to \nevolve as members develop and increase their multi-skilling competencies.  \n\u2022 Being multi-skilled is highly valued. This approach fosters the development of \nconfidence amongst team members: they become more able to cope with \nunanticipated events. \n \n \nMAINTENANCE CULTURE AND LEARNING \n \nA dictionary definition of culture is that it encompasses the inherited ideas, beliefs, values and \nknowledge, which constitute the shared basis for social action. Culture is an integrated pattern \nof human behaviour and interactions. This behaviour includes thought, speech, actions, and \nthose objects created as a result of our actions [8]. Culture endures and evolves through our \ncapacity for learning and consequently, through sharing current knowledge with succeeding \ngenerations. Hence, culture is the total of the inherited ideas, beliefs, values and knowledge \nthat contribute the shared bases of social actions. The required behaviour only becomes part \nof the culture through learning and through validation as being acceptable and desirable by \nthe majority of the organisation. \n \n \nBusiness environments need to reflect the ways that the involved personnel wish to live. Most \nenlightened companies have at least heard of a work\/life balance, even if they do not actively \npromote it among their staff. It makes sense to provide an environment and a culture, which \ncontributes to, rather than drains the satisfaction from their staff\u2019s personal lives. Each \norganisation should be committed to creating a culture of support, growth, responsibility and \nvision. Considering staff as individuals, rather than as a generic workforce, is now seen by \nmost companies as a pre-requisite to achieving a positive company culture and hence a higher \nproductivity.  \n \nToday\u2019s gurus of strategy urge companies to democratise the management process, which was \nonce the sole province of a company\u2019s senior officers,  by handing strategic planning over to \nteams of line and staff managers from different disciplines.  To keep the planning process \n 7\nclose to the reality of the market, today\u2019s strategists say it should also include interaction with \nkey customers and suppliers.  \nIt is important that organisations, and particularly top management of those organisations, \nplan effectively and define their ideals, and in particular, state what are the norms and \nminimum values, which support the defined strategy. Top management expresses its ideals \nthrough vision, mission, value and policy statements: it is common for these to include \nreferences to people as being valuable assets. Notwithstanding, only very few organisations \nhave proactive programmes to manage cultural aspects.  \n \nFrom a maintenance perspective, top management is probably the most significant influence \non the maintenance culture. This echelon should create and maintain an internal environment \nin which the personnel can become fully involved in achieving the organisation\u2019s objectives. \nOrganisations that take management systems seriously develop feedback, monitor prevailing \nachievements culture and compare them with the ideal. \n \nMost organisations that do not devote sufficient attention to their human capital, particularly \nin the measurement of quality and effectiveness, usually under-utilise the talent of their \nworkforces. So it is wise for senior managers to invest in assessing the effect of human-capital \nmanagement on profitability to enable the development and establishment of best-practice \nguidance that will help the organisation put the necessary tools in place. The aim is to develop \na culture that supports the organisation\u2019s values while achieving the targeted business results. \nEach organisation should be able to compare its devised culture and by using focus groups, \npropose relevant action plans. There must be an assessment of the attitudes, mind-sets, and \nbeliefs that determine if the maintenance process is accomplished well. Without an \nappropriate culture, it will be difficult to identify what is acceptable day\u2013by\u2013day behaviour. A \nlearning culture fosters personnel, so that they become more innovative and creative by \nharnessing their diverse and individual abilities.  Developing the required culture should be \nconsidered to be an integral part of the whole management process. To remain internationally \ncompetitive, firms must sustain a high rate of internal learning that both refines current \npractices and adopts better ones. Government agencies are continually being required to \nprovide a broader range of services faster, yet without using any extra resources [9]. External \nbenchmarking programmes are popular ways of identifying good practices and show the \nbenefits of demonstrating what is realistically achievable. The learning processes involved in \nestablishing and implementing such programmes also provide benefits for those involved in \nimplementing them. Drew [10] identified several successes achieved by various forms of \nbenchmarking, but also pointed out some potential barriers. According to Harvey and Denton \n[11], six factors are leading to the growing popularity of organisational learning:-  \n \n\u2022 The increasing importance of achieving higher productivities. \n\u2022 The accelerating pace of change in the business environment . \n\u2022 Pertinent knowledge viewed as a means of gaining a competitive advantage.  \n\u2022 Customers becoming more demanding. \n\u2022 Dissatisfaction with the existing management paradigm. \n\u2022 The increasing intensity of competition in the global market \n \nSuccessful learning needs time and patience. According to Senge [12], a discipline is a body \nof practices, based on an underlying theory: it suggests the appropriate path of development. \nThe five disciplines are (i) building a shared mission, (ii) personal mastery, (iii) working with \nmental models, (iv) team learning and (v) system thinking. The first step in creating a learning \n 8\nenvironment should be leadership that is based on teaching abilities, and which assists others \nin understanding complex situations [13].  \n \nMANAGEMENT \n \nIn today\u2019s businesses, the achievement of success usually requires the ability to change and \nadapt quickly. Organisational change is seen as a way of addressing outdated styles of \nmanagement and practices. The key to implementing effective organisational change is the \nwise management of the process (whether it be for cultural change, strategic and business \nplanning, process design, management development or performance improvement). \nGlobalisation of the market and the rapid rise in information-flow capabilities have increased \ncompetition worldwide. In order to compete successfully in todays turbulent, highly \ncompetitive business-environment, organisations are focusing on the satisfaction of \ncustomers\u2019 needs as a means of securing a competitive advantage, or even survival. A major \nstrategic change is that many organisations are striving to achieve customer satisfaction \nthrough an increased emphasis on quality in their products and services. \n  \nTQM has become an umbrella philosophy that encompasses all aspects of management \nranging from strategy, tactics and cost reduction to customer satisfaction and employee \nempowerment. The rigorous implementation of TQM has resulted in a new workplace culture \nand led to changes in management and processes. TQM\u2019s philosophy requires the reduction of \ncosts yet an improvement in the quality of goods produced and\/or services provided as well as \nincreased flexibility and responsiveness. Operations strategies are often focused on \ndeveloping strategic alliances based on core competencies.  In the information age, companies \ntend to operate in a physically-distributed manufacturing or service environment. To integrate \nthe activities along the value chain, various information technologies have been used, \nincluding appropriate education and training to deal with diversities in language and culture -  \nsee for instance the Japanese 5s principles, the 1S0 9001: 2000 standards and the six-sigma \ncriteria, whose implementation will help achieve TQM. The \u20185s\u2019 stands for sort (organise), set \nin order (orderliness), shine (cleanliness), standardise and sustain (through applying \ndiscipline):  this set of principles enables one to realise what is possible and what can be done \nrealistically to improve quality. TQM on the other hand delivers a behavioural mindset and a \nbelief in the achievement of continual improvement that are essential for making concepts \nsuch as six-sigma work well.  \n \nSkills in \u2018change\u2019 management enable personnel to build trust and constructive relationships \nwith their colleagues: in particular, persuasive communications, inspiring motivations and \nleadership skills are desirable. Excellent leadership can be achieved through having a clear \nvision of what is needed, a well-understood, comprehensive mission statement agreed by all \npersonnel, and role-model behaviours of excellent managers rewarded. Thus rigorous \nrecruitment and selection procedures, on-going education and training facilities, and clear \nguidelines about what is expected of each employee are needed. World-class manufacturing \nprocesses such as JIT, TQM and TPM are closely related and, in combination, can help foster \nthe achievement of better performances.  \n \nSUPPORT SYSTEMS \n \nStrategic initiatives, such as the introduction of multi-skilling, inter-trade flexibility, RCM, \nTPM, as well as optimising the redesign of work processes and structures, often fail to deliver \nthe expected benefits. This arises because appropriate management behaviour and support \n 9\nsystems (including pertinent available information and training, performance management \nand reward systems) that should be aligned with using these initiatives were not in place when \nthe change programmes were implemented. Effective deployment of information technology \nin support of maintenance operations is increasingly a vital issue [14]. \n \nPARTICIPATION AND AUTONOMY \n \nParticipation by all personnel is part of the Japanese kaizen concept. Employee empowerment \nis crucial in order to create commitment in the employees\u2019 minds to this end; the management \nshould involve all employees in defining work objectives, specifying how to achieve them \nand setting ambitious but realistic targets. Senge [12] maintains that workers participation \nmust be highly valued and intrinsic motivation sought. Argyris [15] emphasised that while \nautonomy should be a core concept of empowerment, the management should nevertheless \nretain control through information systems, processes and tools. Workers must be empowered \nto make decisions relative to achieving high quality in the production process.  \n \nTEAMS \n \nThe use of teams is based on the old adage that\u201d two heads are better than one\u201d. The teams \nmeet regularly to correct problems and discuss potential improvements by using techniques \nsuch as brainstorming, discussion and quality control. \n \nEDUCATION AND TRAINING \n \nA greater level of skill can be achieved relatively quickly through formal training. This  \nshould not be limited to the transfer of technical skills and knowledge that are needed for \noptimal task performance: it should also cover generic  matters like the  business imperatives \npeculiar to the organisation  (e.g. what determines the value of the product  or service to the \ncustomer), problem-solving techniques, team dynamics and facilitation skills [4]. The \ncompany\u2019s ideals should be communicated to all personnel through education; everyone \nshould be able to understand what these ideals are and why they are important for the \norganisation. \n \nREWARDS AND RECOGNITION \n \nFrom a study of two \u201cbest-practice\u201d organisations (namely Fel-Pro and Steelcase), Meinoun \n[16] identified the following critical success factors for a reward-and-recognition process that \nencourages \u201clean\u201d work:- \n\u2022 Top management\u2019s commitment to lean work and team-based rewards and recognition   \n\u2022 Management being readily available and visible \n\u2022 Employees are regarded as the organisation\u2019s most valuable asset. \n\u2022 Employees value empowerment and involvement as a form of reward and recognition. \n\u2022 The organisation relies on structured processes, policies and comprehensive, but \nsuccinct, documentation as components of (i) a continual process of learning from \nothers, (ii) a pragmatic search for ideas, (iii) reducing time-consuming and labour-\nintensive processes requiring external discipline, and (iv) viable tools providing useful \ninformation for improving virtually any business activity.  \n \nIf an organisation stresses teamwork, the remuneration structure should promote cooperation \nrather than undermine it. A wide variety of remuneration programmes exist that take into \n 10\naccount factors other than rank, experience and length-of-service and are used in progressive \norganisations, while some others use pay \u2013for skill programmes to develop multi-skilled \nemployees. Pay \u2013 for \u2013 performance and goal \u2013 sharing programmes award bonuses that are \nlinked to group performances. Argyris [15] cautions that offering the \u201cright\u201d rewards alone is \nunlikely to produce sustained empowerment. The power of such methods to maintain \ncommitment declines with use: today\u2019s privileges become tomorrow\u2019s rights. Just \ninvolvement and autonomy are the main lasting motivations that activate the human mind and \ndrive human effort. \n \nPERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT \n \nIn a globally - competitive economy, enterprises must pay continuous attention to increasing \nresponsiveness to changes in customers\u2019 demands and to the achievement of a competitive \nadvantage over their rivals. This means that the organisation should be addressing the \nquestions of:- \n\u2022 How well does it facilitate the achievement of its mission? \n\u2022 How does it compare with respect to effectiveness and efficiency with other \norganisations?  \n\u2022 How does it report its achievements to its stakeholders?  \n\u2022 How does it get feed-back from those stakeholders?  \n \nPerformance is measured with reference to clearly-defined objectives. Campbell [17] gave the \ncommonly-classified maintenance performance indicators as measures of: \n \n\u2022 Equipment performance, such as its availability, reliability and overall equipment \neffectiveness (OEE) \n\u2022 Process performance, such as the ratio of planned to unplanned work, or scheduled \ncompliance  \n\u2022 Cost performance, such as the costs for labour, material and maintenance \n \nThese performance indicators may be tracked because:- \n\u2022 The indicators have been used by the organisation previously. \n\u2022 Some of them are used for benchmarking in other organisations. \n\u2022 The required data are easy to collect. \n\u2022 Regulators or the corporate office mandates that some of them should be measured. \n \nSimson [18] is of the opinion that these diagnostic measures determine whether the various \naspects of the maintenance operations remain properly in control or compare favourably with \nthose of counterparts elsewhere. Thus, they are used largely to support operational control and \nbenchmarking purposes. Tsang [19] has described a process for managing maintenance \nperformance from a strategic perspective (see figure 1). \n \n \n 11\n \n \nFigure 1. SMPM (after 19) \n \nA core feature of the SMPM process is the balanced scorecard (BSC), which provides a \npresentation of strategic-performance measures from four perspectives (i) financial, (ii) \ncustomers, (iii) internal processes, and (iv) learning and growth [20]. By using the BSC, the \nstrategy becomes more tangible and actionable with respect to strategic objectives, the related \nperformance measures and their targets, and action plans. Tsang and Brown [21] reported on \nan electricity-generating facility\u2019s experience of introducing a BSC to measure the total \nperformance of its maintenance functions. The BSC enables a holistic assessment of unit \nperformance to be achieved and guards against sub-optimisation, because all the key \nmeasures that collectively determine the total performance of maintenance are monitored. \n \n \nBENCHMARKING \n \nThis has become one of the most popular business-management tools of the last decade. It has \nbeen promoted as a technique that when implemented brings improvements in quality, \nproductivity and efficiency to an organisation\u2019s business processes by learning from the \nreasons for other organisations\u2019 successes and the application of these better practices in one\u2019s \nown firm. Spendolini [22] identified activities which need benchmarking within several firms, \nstudied best practices by others in these categories, and introduced new processes and systems \nto enhance productivity and quality. \n \nGoals for a benchmarking process are to: \n\u2022 Identify key performance measures for each function of a company\u2019s operations. \n\u2022 Measure the internal performance levels of the company as well as those of its \ncompetitors. \n\u2022 Compare performance levels in order to identify areas of competitive advantage and \nweakness. \n\u2022 Implement programmes for closing the gaps between the internal operations success \nrates and those of other companies. \n \nCorporate \nStrategy \nMaintenance \nObjectives \nMaintenance \nStrategy \nDevice \nAction Plans: \n \ninfrastructural \nchanges \nImplement \nPlans \nPeriodic \nReview \nPerformance \nMeasurement \nImproved \nPerformance \nAims of the \nOrganisation \n 12\nBenchmarking is a process in which companies assets their achievements against those \nimplementing best practice e.g. with respect to having:- \n\u2022 A strong network for the vertical, horizontal, diagonal, intra-team and inter-team \ncommunications \n\u2022 Performance-measurement criteria in place \n\u2022 Employees participating enthusiastically in training \n \nCOMMUNICATIONS \n \nIn the organisation, the ability to communicate effectively is an essential skill at all levels \nfrom the front-line supervisor to the CEO.  In a culture that stresses participation and \nautonomy, the function of the top management is not to control but to support [4], encourage \nand make available hands-on coaching and consultation to help employees avoid unnecessary \nfrustration and waste of effort, to increase task- relevant knowledge and skills, and to \nformulate uniquely appropriate performance strategies that result in process improvements. \nThe management should be responsive to requests from employees and ensure that the \nresources required for enhanced performance are available when needed. MacCoby [23] \nmaintained that every enquiry or complaint should be considered to be an opportunity for \nimprovement, and all the employees are encouraged to turn their complaints into \nimprovements which, if adopted, lead to the person making the suggestion being duly \nrewarded. \n \nManagers formulate strategies, make decisions and monitor progress against plans by \ncollecting, retrieving and analysing data. Management information systems should allow a \ncontinuous rapid flow of information through the organisation to support satisfying these \nmanagerial responsibilities [4]. Many industries, during the recent period of rapid changes \nbrought about by technological break-throughs, have improved their networking technologies \nin order to expand their operations globally. Advances in computer technologies are changing \nmanagement philosophies: the growth of the internet and the World Wide Web are creating \nvirtual organisations and influencing the management concepts.  \n \n The emergence of enterprise systems (ESs) \u2013 soft packages, with fully-integrated modules for \ncontrolling the major processes in the entire organisation \u2013 offers the promise of integrating \nall the information streams in the organisation flowchart. However, Davenport [24] maintains \nthat the decision to introduce a generic, off-the-shelf ES has its pitfalls. Managers should \ncheck whether the logic of the process is in conflict with the logic of the organisation\u2019s \npractices. The suitability of an ES should be determined from a strategic perspective. In other \nwords, the whole enterprise should be more uniformly stressed, not just one part of the \nprocess. \n \nAccording to Tsang [4], if maintenance is a significant function in an organisation, the ES \nshould include modules that have facilities for maintaining records of the history of each item \nof equipment used, support for preventive maintenance, work-order control, inventory control \nand purchasing. Through integration with other software modules, that handle payroll, \naccounts payable, cost accounting, shop-floor data collection and knowledge-base \ndiagnostics, real-time decision-support information can be retrieved by managers using user-\nfriendly interfaces. \n \nOther requirements, imposed by the maintenance managers,  include the modelling of life-\ntime distributions, regular inspections as part of preventive maintenance schedules, and \n 13\nequipment-replacement decisions to provide the data for the documentation of failure modes, \neffect and criticality analysis (FMECA). The process should support the BSC. The design \nshould follow the logic of the process- strategic objectives that are the linked to their \nperformance measures, which, in turn, have their respective targets: the top-level BSC is \ncascaded down to lower level ones. \n  \nE-MAINTENANCE \n \nA major aspect of maintenance management is the optimisation of the inspection, \nmaintenance and replacement decisions [14]. These depends on the availability of good \nquality and timely data, captured by the various computerised systems in the supplier, user \nand service- provider organisations.   The volume of data available to maintenance managers \nis expanding rapidly. The problem is exacerbated in the case of organisations with operations \ncovering large geographical areas, such as public utilities, mining and transportation. Thus the \npotential of digital technologies offers new options to deal with the resulting vat amount of \ndata. Two types of e-maintenance initiatives [4] have evolved:- \n\u2022 e-CBM. Remote sensing devices are deployed to monitor the condition and \nperformance of each physical asset. The captured data are transmitted to a secure site \nfor analysis and decision-making. \n\u2022 e-CMMS. The web enables computerised maintenance management systems \n(CMMSs) to be used. The entire application is available over the web, through the \napplication service provider (ASP). The expert ASP knows the user\u2019s software \nrequirements and provides the user with a total solution and hence the driving forces \nthat makes this option increasingly appealing [13]. In the e-maintenance model, \ninternal processes are expanded to cover other applications on the web. \n \n \nCONCLUSION  \n \nOrganisations that are successful at implementing employee-involvement practices use a \nstrategy to achieve a match between the practices and the organisation\u2019s culture (i.e., its \nunique values, beliefs and mission). Today\u2019s competitive environment requires that industries \nsucceed in sustaining full production capabilities, while minimizing capital investment. From \na maintenance perspective, this means maximizing equipment reliability (i.e. achieving \nmaximum uptime), while extending the plant\u2019s life. This proactive approach needs a total \nplanned quality maintenance (TPQM) programme, the systemising of all (i.e. preventive, \npredictive, and planned) maintenance, plus the control of maintenance quality. As the global \nmarketplace becomes more competitive, such advantages are necessary in order to maintain \nthe long-term corporate economic health. The strategic dimensions of maintenance \nmanagement form the basis for wise decision-making which can be performed during any \nphase of the system\u2019s life, but probably sooner than later. Organisational design, maintenance \nmethodology, adequate support systems, corporate culture and general management have \nbeen identified as necessary factors for the effective maintenance in Nigerian electric-power \nstations. The relevant factors are human-data information flow and having an excellent \nlearning organisation. Tsang [4] maintains that understanding the behaviour of personnel at \nwork as well as the conditions for enhancing group effectiveness will produce superior \norganisational designs that stimulate people\u2019s minds and create an internal commitment to the \nenterprise. Due consideration of these factors will also increase the chances of success when \nfaced with rapid change. The maintenance strategy should contain considerations of the \nfollowing elements:  \n 14\n\u2022 Maintenance organisation and management \n\u2022 Measures of effectiveness \n\u2022 Work control \n\u2022 Maintenance-management information system \n\u2022 Personnel records regarding competences \n\u2022 Technical documentation \n\u2022 Logistic support \n\u2022 Maintenance tasks \n\u2022 Maintenance engineering. \n \nThe seamless flow of information is another enabler for achieving exemplary performance. \nThe availability of pertinent information can influence a person\u2019s behaviour when a \nperformance-management process (communicating the espoused strategy and emphasizing a \nbalanced assessment) is employed [4]. E-maintenance has tremendous potential for \nimplementing a maintenance strategy. However, the characteristics of a world-class plant-\npreventive maintenance, with no machine breakdowns during scheduled runs, are as yet \nvirtually non-existent in Nigeria. \n  \nREFERENCE \n \n1.
