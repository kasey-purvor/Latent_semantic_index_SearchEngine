On Justifying Liberal Egalitarianism \n \nPaul Kelly \n \nLondon School of Economics \n \nAbstract: The debate over the nature of egalitarianism has come to \ndominate political philosophy. As ever more sophisticated attempts are made \nto describe the principles of an egalitarian distribution or to specify the good \nor goods that should be distributed equally, little is said about the \nfundamental basis of equality. In virtue of what should people be regarded as \nequal? Egalitarians have tended to dismiss this question of fundamental \nequality. In the first part of the paper I will examine some of these strategies \nof marginalisation and assess whether the issue of fundamental equality \nmatters. Jeremy Waldron has criticised this strategy of avoidance in his \nrecent book God, Locke and Equality. He argues that Locke\u2019s turn to a \ntheistic grounding for fundamental equality provides a better approach to the \nproblem than the approach taken by contemporary liberals such as John \nRawls.  I will examine Waldron\u2019s critique of Rawls and show that it is \nwanting. I will conclude by suggesting that Rawls\u2019 approach to the issue has \na bearing on the way in which equality should be understood as a political \nvalue. This argument for the primacy of a political conception of \negalitarianism has a bearing on the interconnection between core liberal \nvalues and the idea of the state that has been emphasised by Rawls, Dworkin \nand Nagel.  \n \n1. Defending egalitarianism \n \nIt is customary to credit Rawls with resurrecting normative political theory \nwith the publication of A Theory of Justice in 1971. Others might make a \ncase for Brian Barry\u2019s Political Argument of 1965. However one wants to \nexplain it, it is clear that something happens in the late sixties or early \nseventies that marks a move away from the modest application of linguistic \n 2 \nphilosophy to the analysis political concepts, and towards the form of \nnormative theorising we find dominant today. Political philosophy has come \nto be associated with the development of liberal egalitarian theories \nassociated with the names of John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Brian Barry and \ntheir criticism by the likes of G.A. Cohen. Egalitarianism provides the \nbackdrop to increasingly technical questions about responsibility and choice \nversus circumstances, on the one hand and resources, access to advantage or \nprimary goods on the other. Egalitarianism of the form we find in Rawls \nprovides the paradigm within which normal political philosophy is carried \non.  Various summaries of these debates are provided under such headings \nas \u2018Equality of What?\u20191 or \u2018On The Currency of Egalitarian Justice\u20192. Each \nsuggests that the real issue is the question of what should be equalised \u2013 \nincome, resources, primary good, rights, welfare or opportunities for \nadvantage. There is no doubt that these are serious questions deserving of \nattention from political philosophers and theorists. For example, does it \nmake sense to describe oneself as an egalitarian without some clear idea of \nwhat one thinks should be equalised and what should not? But some \nphilosophers such as Ronald Dworkin have suggested that these are not only \n                                                 \n1 Taken from the title of A. Sen\u2019s Tanner Lecture on Human Values in 1980. \n2 The title of an equally famous article by G.A. Cohen, \u2018On The Currency of Egalitarian \nJustice\u2019, Ethics, vol. 99, (1989) pp. 906-44. \n 3 \nimportant questions, but in some sense these are the fundamental questions \nfor egalitarians. The reason for this is that a more fundamental sense of \nequality is assumed by all the rival candidate theories that one finds in \nmodern politics. The differences between such theories are not differences \nbetween those who regard mankind as equals and those who believe in racial \nor hierarchical political theories, rather they are differences over how \nequality of the relevant kind may be achieved. In this general sense every \nserious candidate theory is concerned with equality, the interesting \ndifferences between theories concern answers to questions such as \u2018Equality \nof What?\u2019 or \u2018The Currency of Egalitarian Justice\u2019.3 Some will argue that \nthe only goods to be distributed equally are basic rights to life, liberty and \nproperty, others will focus on social primary goods without which no decent \nlife is possible, others still will try and cash-out the conditions of a valuable \nlife in terms of a bundle of resources which individuals can use differently in \npursuing their preferred conceptions of the good life. On this Dworkinian \nview the broad commitment to equality of concern and respect is the only \ngame in town, what matters for politics and for political theorists is which \ncandidate theory of egalitarianism can see off its opponents. This insight \n                                                 \n3 The exploration of this Dworkinian idea forms the principle narrative of W. Kymlicka, \nContemporary Political Philosophy: An Introduction, 2nd edn., Oxford, Oxford University \nPress, 2002, pp. 2-5. \n 4 \nseems to capture an important aspect of the practice of political philosophy \nwhere theory construction and criticism is what political theorists do.4  But \nmore importantly Dworkin\u2019s argument shifts the meaning of egalitarian from \nthose who believe in basic equality (as he claims that pretty much everyone \nbelieves in equality now) to a more specific answer to the \u2018currency\u2019 and \n\u2018equality of what\u2019 questions. For Dworkin liberal egalitarians are those who \nendorse the idea of equality of resources, for non-liberal egalitarians such as \nG.A. Cohen, egalitarians endorse the idea of equality of access to advantage.  \n \nThe main consequence of the trend that Dworkin identifies and advocates is \nthat it pays scant attention to more traditional questions about the basis of \nfundamental equality, or why we should be interested in equality in the first \nplace. Some philosophers have cast a sceptical eye at Dworkin\u2019s account of \nthe terms of political debate amongst liberals, in particular Joseph Raz has \nmade much of the supposed emptiness of the Dworkinian account of \nequality of concern and respect, yet Raz\u2019s warning seems to have been \nlargely sidestepped.5 This is no doubt in part because Raz does not think \nmuch can be made of the idea of basic of fundamental equality as anything \n                                                 \n4 A fact that is lamented in Brian Barry\u2019s Why Social Justice Matters? Cambridge, Polity \nPress, 2005. Barry suggests in this book that too much political theory is narrowly inward \nlooking and that egalitarians would be more profitably employed looking at how real \nequality can be achieved in modern democratic societies such as the UK and the US. \n5 See J. Raz, The Morality of Freedom, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1986, chapter 9.  \n 5 \nother than a principle of closure around a group of \u2018equals\u2019. As such equality \nis secondary to the substantive characteristic shared by the group of \u2018equals\u2019 \nsuch that again the real issue is one of significance (what matters) and only \nthen, of how it is distributed. And what matter is usually personhood cashed \nout in terms of autonomy. \n \nMost contemporary political philosophers seem to accept either Dworkin\u2019s \nposition or a variation of Raz\u2019s. Barry for example, assumes fundamental \nequality, as the starting point of his \u2018Scanlonian contractualism\u2019 but says \nnothing about why we should accept it.6 For Barry, basic equality is an \naxiom from which other things can be deduced or inferred and the success or \nattractiveness of these inferences is what will confirm and support the initial \naxiom. Such an approach has some common-sense plausibility in that \nanyone who seriously objects to the equal claims of other human beings is \nunlikely to be worried about the nature of social justice and therefore with \nreading Barry\u2019s books. \n \n                                                 \n6 B. Barry, Justice as Impartiality, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1995, p. 70, and B. Barry, \n\u2018Something in the Disputation Not Unpleasant\u2019, in Paul Kelly ed. Impartiality, Neutrality \nand Justice, Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 1998, p. ? \n 6 \nThe other common approach to the problem of basic equality in the \nliterature, which can be illustrated by the example of T.M. Scanlon, is the \nabandonment of the search for a single unified conception of equality as a \nvalue characteristic shared by all individuals and instead its replacement \nwith a re-description of what egalitarians want in terms of a cluster of \ndistinct but related moral commitments. These moral commitments can be \nillustrated by the diversity of reasons for rejecting inequalities.7 Scanlon \nprovides subtle and insightful discussions of what is wrong with suffering \nand severe deprivation, stigmatizing differences in status, unacceptable \ndomination, procedural unfairness and unfair outcomes. These diverse faces \nof objectionable inequality depend on values other than basic equality of \nconcern and respect and suggest that it is particular types of inequality that \nare wrong and not necessarily inequality per se.  This approach is shared by \nmany philosophers, who agree with Scanlon that it is both more sensitive to \nour moral experience whilst allowing us to challenge objectionable social \nand political practices.  \n \nWhat both approaches suggest is that not much turns on the idea of basic \nequality \u2013 or that in virtue of which we are worthy of equality of concern \n                                                 \n7 T.M. Scanlon, \u2018The Diversity of Objections to Inequality\u2019, reprinted in M. Clayton and \nA. Williams, The Ideal of Equality, Basingstoke, Palgrave, 2002, pp. 41-59. \n 7 \nand respect \u2013 and therefore that political theory can proceed without paying \nthe idea much attention. What really matters is the internal analysis and \ncritique of particular theories in the attempt to converge upon a position that \nmerits support because it has seen off all of the available contenders. This \nstrategy has some attractions in terms of how we do political theory. If every \ntime we wished to address what is wrong with unjust social arrangements or \npolicies we had to build a theory from the ground up, we would never make \nany contribution to wider political and moral debate. To demand this fully \nfoundationalist approach of political philosophers seems to make no more \nsense then requiring biologists or chemists to do fundamental work in basic \nphysics before advancing any hypotheses in their own fields of enquiry.  So \npolitical philosophers can seek to make some progress in debates between \nluck-egalitarians, sufficientarians, prioritarians and humanitarians by the \ninternal analysis and criticism of their arguments, presuppositions and \nimplications. This is one strategy employed by many political philosophers.8 \nYet the question remains whether it is ultimately insufficient as a complete \ndefence of a political principle that may be used to justify coercion in the \nreal world of politics, or at least will claim to justify such coercion. The \n                                                 \n8 Indeed it is a strategy I have used myself in Liberalism, Cambridge, Polity Press, 2004. \nIt can also be found in Jeremy Bentham\u2019s attempt to provide an informal justification of \nthe primacy of the principle of utility in An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and \nLegislation. [(1789)]. See the discussion in R. Harrison, Bentham, London, Routledge, \n1983, pp. 187-8. \n 8 \nreason for this is that showing that a particular perspective can withstand a \ncritical engagement with other theories cannot show its uniqueness as the \nright basis for social cooperation and political coercion. This is because a \ntheory\u2019s unique ability to withstand critical challenge depends upon being \nable to set limits to the range of possible rival candidate theories. In the case \nof arguments for egalitarianism these rival theories will not only be \nalternative egalitarian theories up to and including utilitarianism but also the \nwhole range of non-egalitarian arguments and theories. Just as the strategy \nof internal analysis and criticism will not single out the uniqueness of \negalitarianism amongst its rivals so similarly it will not provide support to \nthe idea of fundamental equality, as there is no non-question begging sense \nin which egalitarianism must win out over non-egalitarian theories.  \n \n2. Do we need an account of Basic Equality? \n \nA question we might ask ourselves at this point is whether it really matters \nthat we do not provide a justification or defence of fundamental equality? I \nam interested in the question of why we should regard other (all?) human \nbeings as equals. My interest and the point of this question is not the search \nfor a universal motivation to act morally although clearly if we can find a \n 9 \nground for regarding other human beings as moral equals this will have a \nbearing on questions of the scope and demands of our obligations. Rather I \nam concerned with why we should be concerned with basic equality in the \nfirst place and what an appropriate concern for basic equality would look \nlike. This question is certainly concerned with the scope of our obligations \nand this does seem to be central to the concerns of contemporary political \nphilosophy.  So at least in this sense the issue of basic equality does seem to \nmatter the question to be answered is what is basic equality and how does it \nhave a bearing on scope?  \n \nThere are three main reasons why the question of basic equality might well \nmatter and therefore why it should merit some equal attention amongst those \npolitical philosophers who regard themselves as egalitarian.9  \n \nThe first reason is the most obvious and concerns the ability of egalitarians \nto say something to anti-egalitarians, Nietzscheans and the defenders of \nnatural aristocracy. Although most contemporary political philosophy is \nconducted against the background of a weak commitment to equality of \n                                                 \n9 I am not suggesting that there should be a complete redirection of attention from \nquestions about the currency of egalitarian justice or the nature of what should be \ndistributed. All I am suggesting is that some attention should be given to this fundamental \nquestion as well, and that certainly seems to be lacking in the contemporary literature. \n 10 \nconcern and respect it is certainly not the case that everyone accepts this \npremise. It is certainly not the case that in the wider world egalitarianism is \nthe norm, whatever Dworkin might claim. As well as the unattractive claims \nof racists, misogynists and homophobes, many people do think that there are \nethically relevant differences between people that undermine the idea of \nbasic equality. These anti-egalitarian claims can be based on prejudice but it \nis not a sign of prejudice as such that one rejects basic equality, as many \negalitarians deny that all departures from equality are morally significant. \nSome inequalities can be egalitarian.  \n \nThe rejection of egalitarianism can take many forms. Some might argue that \nthere are no grounds for attributing equal worth to persons in any respect, \nbecause there are no grounds for attributing moral worth to persons as such. \nFollowers of Nietzsche fall into this group. They see the claims of equality \nas part of the \u2018slave morality\u2019 legacy of Christianity, which in its attempt to \novercome natural hierarchy undermines the status of any ethical values and \nleaves us with nihilism.10 For the nihilist anything goes because every claim \nto value is the assertion of the will to power. The Nietzschean challenge is \nsimilar to the challenge of the amoralist, to whom perhaps no general answer \n                                                 \n10 F. Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil, Harmondworth, Penguin books, 2003. \n 11 \nto the question why be moral can be given. But the challenge for the \negalitarian is also different, because even if we can give some kind of ethical \nresponse to the Nietzschean, of the sort that he too is involved in a kind of \nethical practice, it does not follow that this response will result in equal \nconcern and respect. \n \nNot all anti-egalitarians are nihilists or Nietzsche inspired relativists. Some \nphilosophers take a realist but anti-egalitarian view, a good example is John \nKekes. Kekes rubbishes basic equality on its own grounds by claiming that \nbecause egalitarians do not take seriously the issue of evil they are unable to \nsee why some people are less worthy of moral consideration than others and \nhence are not in the relevant sense equals. He gives the examples of \ntorturers, murderers and concentration camp guards as the sort of people \nwho show through their actions that they are less worthy of consideration \nthan others.11 Kekes\u2019s argument is important, in at least this respect, in that \nhe argues against prescriptive or moral equality, whilst potentially conceding \nthe case in favour of descriptive equality.  Thus all people may satisfy some \nnatural criterion of equality as human beings (all having interests) yet fail to \nsatisfy the relevant criteria of moral equality because of the repugnance of \n                                                 \n11 J. Kekes, The Illusions of Egalitarianism, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003. \n 12 \ntheir acts and motives. It is at least arguable that certain kinds of person are \nnot worthy of equal consideration even if we decline to deny them any \nprotection of the law. We might for example find some people so repugnant \nin their acts, (torturers are a good example) that we deny them equal concern \nand respect in any meaningful sense, and the only reason we do not allow \nthem to become total moral outlaws is the concern not to demean ourselves \nrather than any concern for their status. \n \nWithout some criterion of basic equality we have no way of responding to \nthe challenge of anti-egalitarians and this fact is perhaps more pressing today \nthan for many years because of the unfortunate consequences of the so-\ncalled war on terror and the clash of civilisations thesis. It is too easy to \ndismiss such people as beyond the pale and therefore not deserving of \nserious consideration. If egalitarianism is only of interest to other \negalitarians then it is unlikely to have much impact beyond the confines of \nthe seminar room. \n \nYet the problem is not simply that egalitarians will have little to say to the \nwider world of anti-egalitarianism. The problem is also one of consistency. \nEgalitarians cannot accuse anti-egalitarians of missing a crucial point of \n 13 \nmoral significance if they are themselves going to avoid any justification and \nexplanation of the grounds of equal treatment. The Dworkinian view is to \nreject as candidates for serious consideration, principles and policies that are \nsystematically anti-egalitarian such as racial discrimination on the grounds \nthat it fails to acknowledge a basic parameter of ethics. Yet this argument is \nseriously weakened if there is no attempt to explain and defend the basis of \nthat ethical parameter. If, one steps-back from righteous indignation and \nasks dispassionately what is the anti-egalitarian missing, we find the \nimportance of making some case for basic equality. The anti-egalitarian can \nwant many of the things that egalitarians want, but differ only in that he \nwants them for the morally worthy. This is not quite the position taken by \nKekes who wants to reject substantive egalitarianism as well, but it is one \nthat could be based on his anti-egalitarian argument from evil. There is no \ngood reason for the anti-egalitarian to reject the idea that once one has \nweeded out all the torturers and other evildoers, amongst the remainder \nequality might be the appropriate grounds of moral and political recognition. \nThis is not unlike the idea of equality between equals that we find in \nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics. Here the idea is that amongst those sharing \nthe appropriate quality or excellence there should be equality of treatment, \nso that, for example, amongst able violinists, violins should be equally \n 14 \ndistributed. This form of egalitarianism is consistent with most forms of \nelitism and political systems such as aristocracy.  \n \nThis brings us to the third reason for providing an account of basic or \nfundamental equality namely the problem of scope. As we have just seen \nsome of those who claim to reject egalitarianism could with consistency \naccept a form of egalitarianism as equality amongst equals. The question of \nthe scope of egalitarian principles is therefore very important as how we \ndefine the scope of basic equality seems to have a direct bearing on the \nnature of egalitarian principles. Just as we could reconstruct the anti-\negalitarian argument of Kekes so that it is consistent with allowing \negalitarianism amongst a suitably circumscribed group of worthy \nindividuals, so in the case of most other egalitarian principles we could \ncircumscribe the group to whom they are supposed to apply. This is not \nmerely an unintentional consequence of egalitarian arguments for one of the \ncentral debates in liberal political theory concerns the question of the scope \nof liberal egalitarian political principles. If we take Rawls\u2019 theory as an \nexample we can see how the argument of A Theory of Justice,12 was \nassumed to have a broadly cosmopolitan scope, yet that in Political \n                                                 \n12 See especially the interpretation of Rawls theory in C. Beitz, Political Theory and \nInternational Relations,  rev. edn., Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1999. \n 15 \nLiberalism and A Law of Peoples,13 the egalitarian principles of \u2018justice as \nfairness\u2019 are clearly supposed to apply to the members of \u2018a people\u2019 rather \nthan to all people as such. Some have accused Rawls of apostasy in moving \nfrom his cosmopolitan to communitarian conception of liberalism, but \narguably Rawls always claimed that equality in the relevant sense is \nsomething appropriate to those who share in the same scheme social \ncooperation and he is not alone amongst egalitarian liberals in holding such \na view.14 So at the heart of modern liberalism we already have ethical \ndistinctions between individuals. Some of these distinctions can no doubt be \nexplained via the institutional division of labour between political equality, \nwhich clearly presupposes membership of a polity, economic equality, \nwhich assumes some form of social and economic cooperation and more \nbasic forms of equality, which simply depend on common humanity. But \nthat is not sufficient if we are to prioritize the respective claims of these \nvarious forms of equal treatment. Do the claims of individuals as such, to be \nequals, trump the claims of co-operators or members of the same ethical \ncommunity?

Although I have not be able to find a clear statement in \nhis writings Ronald Dworkin claimed in a conversation with the author that there was no \nsuch thing as international justice. Presumably the point is that whatever equality exists \nbeyond border is different from what exists amongst those within a political community. \n 16 \nother kinds of egalitarian, I do not see how we can make much in the way of \nprogress without addressing the basis and character of fundamental \nequality.15  The issue of the scope of equality versus ideas that may be more \nfundamental such as humanity is precisely what is being debated amongst \ndefenders and critics of cosmopolitan egalitarianism.  \n \nFor all of the reasons given above it is clear that the issue of basic equality is \nsomething that egalitarians should not ignore as it affects the scope and \ntherefore the plausibility of the arguments they make about \u2018currency\u2019 and \n\u2018distributive principles\u2019. One of the few political philosophers who have \nsought to address head on the issue of basic equality is Jeremy Waldron. He \nwrites; \n Basic equality is so fundamental to innumerable aspects of our \nethical outlook that it requires a special sort of defense \u2013 at once \ntranscendent and powerful \u2013 so that it can both underpin what are \nusually taken to be the starting points of public justification and also \n                                                 \n15 I am aware that most cosmopolitans will answer that they do have a conception of \nbasic equality which gives priority to humanity over other forms of ethical relationship, \non the grounds that they are concerned with humanities equal status as the bearer of \ninterests. This is however too quick as the idea of human interests is still controversial, \nindeed it is partly what theories of egalitarian justice try to explain. Some accounts of \nbasic interests might actually presuppose membership of certain kinds of communities, \nsuch as juridical states, in order for people to enjoy freedom.  \n 17 \nprevail in the face of the various temptations that invite us to start \ndrawing distinctions between types and grades of human being.16 \nIn the next section of the paper I propose to examine Waldron\u2019s argument \nbased on his reading of Locke and his use of this to mount a critique of the \ntreatment of basic equality in contemporary liberalism such as that of John \nRawls. Before turning to Waldron\u2019s argument it is worthwhile just \nreminding our selves of the point of turning to basic or fundamental equality. \nThe issue is in virtue of what are human beings deserving of equal \nconsideration and respect? My point will not be to provide an \nunchallengeable defence of equality, rather the point will be to identify the \nnature of the claim to basic equality as only then will we be in a position to \ndetermine the requirements of any defence or justification of that claim. \n  \n3. Basic Equality \u2013 Christian or Liberal? \n \nWaldron\u2019s discussion of basic equality is developed in the context of his \nreinterpretation of Locke\u2019s moral and political philosophy. One of the \ndistinctive features of his argument is that Locke should be read as a \nphilosopher who has potentially interesting things to say about fundamental \n                                                 \n16 J. Waldron, God, Locke and Equality, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, \np. 14. \n 18 \nphilosophical problems and not merely as an historical curiosity. As such he \nchallenges the interpretation of Cambridge historians such as Peter Laslett \nand John Dunn who both argue that because of Locke\u2019s seventeenth century \ntheological views there are no issues of contemporary political relevance \nabout which we can learn anything from Locke.17 This means that we can \nboth learn something about basic equality from Locke\u2019s arguments but more \ncontroversially we do not have to discard Locke\u2019s theological beliefs in \norder to learn from him. For Waldron, the discussion of basic equality is not \nmerely a side issue in an historical discussion of a past political thinker: we \ncan learn something about the \u2018shape\u2019 of basic equality from Locke that has \na bearing on how we judge secular contemporary discussions of basic \nequality such as that notably offered by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice. I \ndo not intend to say anything here about Waldron\u2019s methodology of \nhistorical enquiry or his critique of Cambridge historicism, other than to note \nthat I am in broad agreement with him. Our primary concern is what we can \nlearn about the \u2018shape\u2019 or nature of the criteria of fundamental equality. \n \n                                                 \n17 See P.Laslett, \u2018Introduction\u2019 to John Locke, Two Treatises of Government ed. P. \nLaslett, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1988, and J. Dunn, The Political \nThought of John Locke: An Historical Account of the Argument of \u2018Two Treatises of \nGovernment\u2019, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1969. \n 19 \nLocke is interesting for Waldron because he has a conception of the \nfundamental equality of all mankind in the Second Treatise as the bearers of \nrights and therefore of ethical significance. In this sense Locke too seems to \nfall into Dworkin\u2019s claim that equality is the only game in town. What \nmakes Locke interesting is how he seeks to cash out that claim.  Locke \nseems to both reject a straightforward species-based naturalism and appeal \nto the idea of the species as the principle of closure of his conception of \nmoral significance.  \n \nHuman beings are not equal because they belong to the same species Man. \nAnd the reason for this argument is to be found in Locke\u2019s account the \nconcept or term species in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding18. In \nthe Essay\u2019 Locke rejects species terms as what he calls nominal essences. \nNominal essences are collections of ideas derived from sensation and \nexperience derived from nature. However, they are not based on real \ndistinctions between objects of experience and therefore cannot provide the \nbasis for real distinctions between species, and more importantly between \nmankind as a species and other kinds of species. The point about this is that \nour use of species terms cannot draw a real distinction between one species \n                                                 \n18 J. Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, ed. P.H. Nidditch, Oxford, \nClarendon Press, 1971, III. vi.  \n 20 \nand another, although it can identify some nature features of creatures which \nare not shared by all. How we distinguish these criteria is largely based on \nconvention and practice and it is for that reason that species terms will not \nprovide the right kind of distinctions and discriminations. We can see an \nintimation here of the kind of arguments used by defenders of animal rights \nor animal welfare such as Peter Singer. He would certainly not deny any \ndifferences between what we call species, but rather like Locke, would deny \nthe significance of these basically conventional distinctions for real and \nmorally relevant distinctions between classes of being.19 What we focus on \nin making such distinctions will draw the boundaries of moral significance \nand therefore who or what counts as an equal. Appealing the idea of a \ncommon species will not do the relevant work because the classification is \nconventional though based in nature but it is not given directly by nature. \nNames will not help us here.  \n \nSo much for the argument of the Essay, yet in the Two Treatises Locke does \nuse the idea of the human species as the principle of closure of his account \nof ethical significance. This sets up and interesting historical question about \n                                                 \n19 P. Singer, Practical Ethics, 2nd edn., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1993. \n 21 \nthe consistency of Locke\u2019s works which I do not intend to pursue.20 Waldron \nsuggests that Locke overcomes this apparent contradiction by weakening the \nstatus of the species based claim in the Two Treatises. \n \nAccording to Waldron, Locke does not assert the strong claim about species \nidentity as the boundary marker of significance for the reasons he sets out in \nthe Essay. Instead, he falls back on the less ambitious claim that the \nperceptible qualities that make up the nominal essence of the species \nMankind do actually contain some real resemblances that allow us to draw a \nboundary around the group of equals as the group of human beings. The key \nfeatures that he picks out are that human beings are corporeal beings and that \nthey have the capacity to think rationally or (what he takes to be the same \nthing) abstractly. The emphasis on corporeal beings is important because it \nsuggests that Locke is concerned with human selves or persons and not souls \ndespite his obvious religious commitments. This criteria distinguishes \nhuman persons from any other kind of non-corporeal entity should they exist \nand whatever they might happen to be. This choice has the important \n                                                 \n20 P. Laslett argues that Locke made no attempt to make the arguments of the Essay and \nthe Two Treatises consistent, and to seek such consistency is to force interpretations upon \nLockes\u2019 works that they ultimately will not sustain.  \n 22 \nimplication for Locke that despite his theological presuppositions the scope \nof his conception of morality is definitely humanist.  \n \nThe second characteristic that Locke identifies is the capacity for abstract \nthought or rationality. This immediately suggests one standard objection to \nall naturalistic attempts to ground ethical equality namely that not all of \nthose we might include amongst \u2018humankind\u2019 express the capacity to think \nabstractly. One simple response would be to robustly deny that those who do \nnot manifest that characteristic are moral equals. Thus infants, most children \nup to a certain age, many elderly people as well as those with mental \ndisabilities, those in comas etc., would seem to fall outside the scope of \nmoral equality. Yet many of these people are precisely the kind of people we \nwould want to protect by according them moral equality. Locke does not \ntake this view, instead according to Waldron, he uses the capacity to exhibit \nabstract rational thought as a range-property, an idea derived from Rawls \nwhich seems to fits Locke\u2019s arguments about the scope of the capacity for \nabstract thought.21 The point about a range-property is that it allows for \ndifferences of degree within a range. Waldron illustrates Rawls\u2019 point with \n                                                 \n21 J. Rawls, A Theory of Justice, rev edn.,Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 444. \n 23 \nthe example of being in New Jersey.22 Both Hoboken and Princeton fall \nwithin the range concept though they differ in the degree to which they fall \nwithin the State of New Jersey. Hoboken is on the border with New York. It \nis falling within the range that matters for Waldron and Locke and not the \ndegree. So although people differ in the degree to which they exhibit the \ncapacity for abstract thought this does not matter from the point of view of \nidentifying the relevant criterion of equality.  \n \nBut even if we can use the idea of the capacity for abstract thought amongst \ncorporeal beings, Waldron\u2019s account of Locke\u2019s theory of basic equality \nseems to fall foul of the other standard criticism of naturalistic theories of \nethics, namely how ethical significance is derived from what Locke \nconcedes is a natural capacity, or how we move from descriptive to \nprescriptive equality? It is here that Locke\u2019s argument takes a theological \nturn and it is at this point that Waldron also argues that the significance of \nthe appeal to God becomes important for making sense of equal status and \nvalue.  \n \n                                                 \n22 J. Waldron, God, Locke and Equality, p. 77. \n 24 \nThe argument works in the following way, the capacity of abstract reasoning \nis identified as significant, not simply because it is widely universally shared \n(though to differing degrees) by all human beings. Instead the significance \nof abstract reasoning is that it enables each person to understand themselves \nas a part of the created order and from this they can reason to their obligation \nto preserve that order including other moral equals as part of the basic moral \nobligation we have to God. The idea seems to be as there is something rather \nthan nothing there must have been a creator and therefore, a purpose to that \ncreation of which human agents are a part. As soon as they ask themselves \nwhy have they been endowed uniquely with this capacity for abstract \nthought they will begin on an easy process of reasoning to the idea of a \ncreated order that gives a purpose and therefore a meaning to the possession \nand exercise of these capacities. \n \nThere are a number of important points to note from Waldron\u2019s account of \nLocke\u2019s theory. Firstly, a straightforward appeal to a natural property will \nnot be sufficient to ground basic equality. Secondly, that natural capacity is a \nrange property that admits of significant differences in degree. Thirdly, the \nappeal to God provides the important account of the significance of this \ncapacity \u2013 what Waldron calls the \u2018shape\u2019 of basic equality.  It is important, \n 25 \naccording to Waldron that Locke\u2019s appeal to God is not for the traditional \nnatural law idea of an authoritative sanction of our basic moral obligation. \nClearly, for Locke, God does sanction the basic moral law of equal respect, \nbut that is not the key point. The appeal to God and therefore a transcendent \nauthority, provides the meaning and significance of the real resemblances \n(corporeality and capacity for rationality) on which moral equality is based. \nThus the appeal to God in the defence of basic equality is not merely a \ncontingent fact of Locke\u2019s historical circumstances that can be bracketed off \nfrom his \u2018proper\u2019 philosophical doctrines, it is central to his defence of \nequality. Yet Waldron also rejects the obvious contemporary response, \nwhich is that, if the defence of equality depends upon an appeal to God so \nmuch the worse for equality. It is hard enough trying to defend \negalitarianism without having to defend the existence of God as Locke \nconceives him. It is precisely this source of transcendence that is \nsignificantly missing, according to Waldron in contemporary liberal theories \nof basic equality, and it is perhaps the embarrassment at having no such \ntranscendent significance that causes liberals to fall back on either silence or \na muted appeal to individuals as bearers of interests.  \n \n 26 \nPrecisely what we are supposed to make of Waldron\u2019s argument is carefully \nambiguous. One could take the view that he is merely repeating the standard \ncriticism of liberal theories to the effect that the bracketing strategy and the \navoidance of substantive philosophical or metaphysical commitments is \nunsustainable.23 This is certainly part of Waldron\u2019s critique of Rawls in this \naccount of the Lockean alternative. But this familiar, though perhaps \nimportant, point is not all that Waldron is offering us. Although he provides \na defence of Locke\u2019s view that civil society cannot accommodate atheists, he \ndoes not expressly say that a belief in God is essential for those who count as \nmoral equals \u2013 a view that is actually not so alien in modern democracies. \nYet because Waldron wants to take Locke\u2019s argument seriously it does look \nas though he does endorse the need for God and the transcendent to make \nsense of our commitment to basic equality. Without it we are no better than \nthe Nietzscheans who have no interest in equality or morality.  \n \nWhere Waldron\u2019s challenge to contemporary liberalism is most clear is his \nsuggestion that Rawls\u2019 defence of basic equality fails because it lacks the \n                                                 \n23 A version of this argument can also be found in Charles Taylor\u2019s Sources of the Self, \nCambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1989. Taylor is concerned with the way in \nwhich the resources from which our modern conceptions of self-hood such as the free and \nequal subject of democratic citizenship are under threat in late modernity. His concern is \nthat what he calls horizontal secularism is in danger of undercutting the support of values \nwe cherish. This is precisely what Nietzsche predicted in his Beyond God and Evil and \nthe Genealogy of Morality. \n 27 \n\u2018shape\u2019 or transcendent account of meaning and significance that basic \nequality needs. There is no alternative to substantive philosophical, \nmetaphysical and even theological arguments in providing a defence of basic \nequality.   Is Waldron right about Rawls and what does this tell us about the \nnature of fundamental equality? \n \nLet us remind ourselves what according to Waldron, Locke\u2019s appeal to God \ndoes in respect of justifying basic equality. His key point is that the appeal to \nthe idea of God and a divine purpose provides the sources of an \ninterpretation of the natural capacities of corporeal rationality, which gives \nthem their special status amongst the range of other possible real \nresemblances amongst mankind. It is the meaning of the natural capacities \nthat matters. \n \nRawls offers us an account of basic equality in terms of two features of \nmoral personality, the capacity to form and pursue a conception of the good \nand the capacity for a sense of justice.24 These capacities are natural \ncapacities but for Rawls they are also range properties, indeed as we have \nseen it was Rawls who introduces the notion. Consequently, people can \n                                                 \n24 J. Rawls, A Theory of Justice, rev. edn., p. 442. \n 28 \nmanifest these capacities to a greater or lesser degree, thus covering the \nquestion of natural differences in intelligence and ability. It is also \ninteresting that Rawls\u2019 characterisation of the two basic characteristics of \nmoral personality as range properties answers Kekes\u2019s challenge about the \negalitarians ability to take account of evil. For even Kekes\u2019s examples of \ntorturers and murderers still have these capacities despite attempting to \novercome or ignore their importance. It is for this reason that Rawls and \nliberal egalitarians see no one as beyond the protection of the law, however \nheinous their crimes may be. In this Rawls\u2019 position is also superior to that \nof Locke who as we have seen leaves atheists outside the law.  \n \nSo far Rawls\u2019 position seems to mirror that attributed to Locke. Where they \ndiffer is on the issue of significance and meaning. Waldron claims that \nRawls\u2019s account of moral personality has no shape as Rawls rejects the idea \nof appealing to some transcendent significance of these characteristics of \nmoral personality. But this argument seems a bit hasty. Rawls does provide \nan interpretation of the significance of moral personality but in so doing he \ndoes not appeal to some external source of authority or significance. Instead \nRawls interpretation of the significance of moral personality is spelt out \nthrough the articulation of a full theory of equal treatment appropriate to the \n 29 \nkind of persons who find themselves in the initial choice situation of his \ntheory of justice as fairness. This is similar to the strategy of analysis and \ncriticism of candidate theories of egalitarianism that I identified in the first \npart of the paper. But the strategy of Rawls employs here is rather different \nin that Rawls sees part of the task of theory construction as specifying the \nnature of basic equality whilst the appeal to basic equality places constraints \non the character of that theory construction. Theory construction and the \nstrategy of reflective equilibrium are obviously important parts of Rawls\u2019 \naccount of the characteristic features of moral personality. The meaning and \nsignificance of the two basic features of moral personality is provided by the \nrole they play in making sense of a just social order. Waldron\u2019s challenge is \nwhether the process of explaining basic equality in this way is sufficient? \nBut in order to answer his challenge we need an account of sufficient for \nwhat? \n \nWaldron\u2019s demand cannot be that Rawls sees off all challengers to his \naccount of basic equality, as Waldron\u2019s own Lockean theory is hardly likely \nto fair even as well as Rawls\u2019s. For if Waldron argument is not merely for \nthe development of a  philosophical anthropology before we can do political \ntheory, but the more demanding claim that we need to take theology \n 30 \nseriously, then his position would seem far more precarious than Rawls\u2019s. \nHis argument does seem to play into the hands of the Nietzscheans by saying \nthat equality depends upon a conception of God, but as we have no good \narguments for belief in God we cannot sustain a conception of equality. \nLocke may well be providing us with an argument for basic equality but it is \nhardly one we should take very seriously. Rawls does not set the barrier of \njustification quite so high, so the idea of self-sufficiency in his account of \nbasic equality must count as an advantage over Waldron and Locke. If the \nquestion is the role and purpose of basic equality it is not obvious that \nWaldron\u2019s turn to the transcendent is necessary, although clearly some \nargument beyond the identification of a natural property is important. Where \nWaldron\u2019s argument ultimately differs is on the issue of the sanction of basic \nequality, or why we should respect it. But this is a different question to how \nwe identify the meaning and significance of basic equality, and it is one that \ndepends on the existence of God for its answer. And this is something that \nWaldron does not prove.  \n \nThe question is whether Rawls\u2019 approach is sufficient to address the claims \nof why basic equality matters. His approach certainly offers something to \nsay to the anti-egalitarian about the nature of basic equality. Using the idea \n 31 \nof a range property he is able to address anti-egalitarians such as Kekes or \nothers who deny the idea that there can be natural properties that include \nsufficient numbers to meet the aspirations of egalitarian theories. By \nproviding an interpretation of the basic capacities of moral personality \nRawls theory meets the demands of consistency in addressing alternative \nnon-egalitarian theories. Finally there is the issue of scope. Here Rawls \naccount of basic equality takes an interesting turn. He develops the idea of \nmoral personality in the initial situation of establishing fair terms of social \ncooperation.25 The point seems to be that basic equality exists first and \nforemost amongst those engaged in constructing a fair scheme of social \ncooperation. What is not developed in this argument but what is increasingly \nclear in Rawls\u2019 work is that basic equality is primarily a political notion that \nis articulated against the backdrop of a certain kind of political society \u2013 a \njust state.  This certainly goes some way to explaining why liberal \negalitarian theories see equality as primarily a \u2018sovereign virtue\u2019 that \nexpresses the relationships that exist between members of a just political \ncommunity and its structures of power and authority. In the absence of \npolitical society the issue of basic equality would not have the same \nsignificance. But one should not conclude from this that Rawls\u2019 confines the \n                                                 \n25 J. Rawls, A Theory of Justice, rev.edn., p. 442. \n 32 \nscope of equal recognition to fellow citizens. There are after all two basic \nfeatures of moral personality, the capacity for a sense of justice is only one \nof them. All individuals share in the capacity for a conception of the good, \nand it is no doubt in virtue of this that some form of cosmopolitan harm \nprinciple can be constructed.  What is clear is that Rawls does not provide a \nsimple answer to the issue of the scope of basic equality. At one level the \ncapacity for a conception of the good is broad enough in range to encompass \nmost of humanity. Yet at the level of a capacity for justice, it is not obvious \nthat this entails relationships that are, at the political level, cosmopolitan in \nscope. The point here is not just one of a division of labour, but rather the \nmore substantial claim that some of the relationships that count as part of \nbeing political equals are constituted by membership of the appropriate kind \nof political community, namely a state regulated by the two principle of \njustice.  This approach to basic equality is developed in Rawls\u2019 later works \nsuch as A Law of Peoples, but even if one does not follow Rawls\u2019 argument \nfully in this direction it is clear that he offers at best a \u2018statist\u2019 version of \ncosmopolitanism.  \n \nWhat can we conclude from the above? Rawls does not provide the only \npossible route to the justification of a liberal egalitarian perspective, but his \n 33 \napproach to the issue of basic equality is insightful because it does not \nwholly marginalize the issue in the way that Dworkin\u2019s rival theory of \nliberal egalitarianism appears to. Furthermore, Rawls\u2019 theory connects the \nspecification of basic equality to the context of a special form of political \nassociation but does not wholly subordinate equality to the issue of the \ninternal structure of a just state.  In more general terms we can also see that \nwhilst the defence of basic equality forms an important part of the defence of \nsubstantive egalitarian theories of distributive justice, one can overstate the \nimportance of defending basic equality along the lines suggested by \nWaldron. Where this leaves us, is with a defence of the status quo in terms \nof how political philosophers should proceed. The analysis and critique of \nrival theories of egalitarianism has an important role in the wider defence of \nbasic equality. What we should not expect is some theory independent \naccount of a basic natural property in virtue of which people become moral \nequals, but neither should we lament the fact of the absence of such a \nproperty. The appeal to basic equality is important in making sense of the \negalitarian project but the account of basic equality is not a straightforward \nfirst premise from which all else must be derived. It is a central part of the \nprocess of egalitarian argument in so far as it forces us to concentrate on the \nissue of the scope of our principles, and this is something that can be lost in \n 34 \na preoccupation with issues such as the currency of egalitarian justice. But in \nmaking the defence of basic equality depend on the articulation of an \negalitarian theory of the just political community we open up scope not only \nfor philosophical arguments but also establish opportunities for other forms \nof political theorising to assist in providing representations of the core idea \nof basic equality and the forms of social relationships on which it depends.  \nAlthough Waldron\u2019s account of Locke proved to be unhelpful in providing \nthe foundation of basic equality, perhaps there is scope for marshalling past \nhistorical thinkers and modes of thought in defending basic equality. Perhaps \nI could suggest Tom Paine. \n \n"}
