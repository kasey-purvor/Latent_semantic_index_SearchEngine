The \ndetachments acted as a focus for fluid flow which lubricated these d\u00e9collement \nsurfaces, aiding in the subglacial transport of the rafts. \n \n \n \n 1\n1. Introduction \nGlacial rafts, \u2018floes\u2019 or \u2018megablocks\u2019 are defined as dislocated slabs of bedrock and\/or \nunconsolidated sedimentary strata that have been transported from their original \nposition by glacial action (Stalker, 1976; Christiansen and Whitaker, 1976; \nRuszczynska-Szenajch, 1987; Aber, 1985, 1988; Broster and Seaman, 1991; Benn and \nEvans, 1998). Such rafts are typically very thin (up to a few tens of metres) in \ncomparison to their aerial extent (up to several 100 km2), and may have been \ntransported for just a few tens of metres up to several hundred kilometres. They \ngenerally occur as single, horizontal slab-like features, but may be stacked within \nconspicuous ice-pushed hills of various types (Aber, 1988; Benn and Evans, 1998). \nAlthough internally the rafts largely appear undeformed, they may be cut by shear \nzones, faults and breccia\/cataclastic zones, or even folded. It was generally thought \nthat rafts were detached and transported whilst frozen to the base of cold-based ice \nsheets, melting out slowly following stagnation and decay of the enclosing ice \n(Banham, 1975; Aber, 1988).  \nMore recent studies of ice-rafted sediments and bedrock, have suggested that \nfailure, leading to detachment, is associated with elevated pore-water pressures that \nmay occur along water-rich d\u00e9collement surfaces within the subglacially deforming \nlayer (Moran et al., 1980; Aber, 1985; Broster and Seaman, 1991; Benn and Evans, \n1998), at the base of the deforming layer (Kj\u00e6r et al., 2006), or as a consequence of \nsubglacial hydrofracturing by forceful upward dewatering (Boulton and Caban, 1995; \nRijsdijk et al., 1999). The role played by pressurised pore-water during both \nsubglacial and, to a lesser extent, proglacial deformation is increasingly being \nrecognised within tectonised glacigenic sequences (Boulton et al., 1974; Boulton and \nCaban 1995; Hiemstra and van der Meer, 1997; Rijsdijk et al., 19999; van der Meer et \nal., 1999; Phillips and Auton, 2000; Boulton et al., 2001; Khatwa and Tulaczyk, 2001; \nPhillips, 2006, Baroni and Fasano, 2006; Phillips et al., 2007). Alternative rafting \nmodels, however, suggest that rafts generated as a result of thrusting associated with \nproglacial deformation, occurring within an imbricate thrust stack (thrust moraine) \nformed in front of the advancing glacier (Banham, 1975; Christiansen and Whitaker, \n1976; Moran et al., 1980; Bluemle and Clayton, 1984; Ruszczynska-Szenajch, 1987). \nMicromorphological analysis is increasingly being used as a principal tool in \nunderstanding the kinematics and geometry of subglacial and proglacial deformation \n(e.g. van der Wateren, 1995; Phillips and Auton, 2000; van der Wateren et al., 2000; \n 2\nvan der Meer et al., 2003; Menzies et al., 2006, Phillips et al., 2007) and \ndistinguishing between diamictons deposited in these environments (e.g. van der Meer \nand Laban, 1990; van der Meer et al., 1992, 1994; van der Meer 1993; Hart and \nRoberts 1994; van der Meer and Warren, 1997; Menzies, 2000; Carr, 2001; Hart and \nRose 2001; Khatwa and Tulaczyk, 2001; Hiemstra and Rijsdijk, 2003; Carr et al., \n2006). Consequently, the application of macrostructural field techniques, combined \nwith detailed micromorphological and microstructural analysis could provide valuable \ninsights into the mechanisms involved during the detachment, transport and \nemplacement of ice-rafted sediment and bedrock slabs.  \nIn this paper we present the results of a detailed macro- and microscopic \nstructural study of the glacitectonic features associated with the ice-rafted glacigenic \nand marine sediments exposed at Clava [NH 760 440], on the SE side of the valley of \nthe River Nairn, NE Scotland (Fig. 1). These allochthonous rafts were transported \nnortheastwards by ice emerging from the Great Glen during the build-up of the last \nice sheet in Scotland (Merritt, 1992; Peacock, 1975; Gordon, 1993). Combined field \nand micromorphological evidence has allowed the development of a glacitectonic \nmodel for the detachment, transport and accretion of these soft-sediment rafts. This \nmodel involves initial thrusting and folding, followed by several phases of \nliquefaction and water-escape. Micromorphological evidence indicates that \npressurised pore-water played a key rock in the transport of the ice-rafted sediments \nexposed at Clava. \n \n2. Regional significance of the Clava shelly marine sediments  \nThe Pleistocene sediments exposed at Clava, 9 km E of Inverness (NE Scotland), \nhave been the focus of significant interest ever since the mid-Nineteenth Century \nwhen clay, underlying till, was found to contain a rich assemblage of undeformed, \nunstriated, cold-water marine shells. The marine clay, known as the Clava Shelly \nClay, occurs at an altitude of 150 m OD and was found to contain delicate paired \nvalves and pebbles with attached epifauna, as well as shells with preserved periostraca \n(Fraser, 1883; Horne et al., 1894). Debate has focused on whether the Clava Shelly \nClay was in situ, having formed in a glaciomarine environment that resulted from \nglacio-isostatically induced submergence (up to 160 m OD) at the margin of an \nexpanding Early Devensian ice sheet, before global sea level had fallen substantially \n(Sutherland, 1981); or whether it had been transported eastwards by ice from the Loch \n 3\nNess basin, where it had been deposited when local sea level had been no higher than \nabout 18 m OD (Horne et al., 1894; Peacock, 1975) (see Gordon, 1993 for a \nsummary).  \nFollowing a detailed re-examination of all known localities at Clava (see Fig. \n1), Merritt (1992) concluded that the shelly sediments did indeed represent an \nassemblage of allochthonous rafts, transported eastwards by ice emerging from the \nGreat Glen during the build-up of the last ice sheet in Scotland. The faunal \nassemblage (Graham et al., 1992), together with infinite conventional radiocarbon \nages and mid-Devensian amino acid dates obtained on the shells, support the \nconclusion that the Clava Shelly Clay was deposited in a high-boreal to low-Arctic \nmarine fjord setting during an early to mid-Devensian interstadial. Amino acid dates \non shells from other raft sites in NE Scotland cluster between 40 and 60 ka BP, \nequivalent to the B\u00f8 Interstadial of SW Scandinavia (Merritt et al., 2003, fig. 43). \nHowever, a small raft of shelly till present at Clava, contained unabraded paired \nvalves of the Arctic bivalve Portlandia arctica and a broken, unabraded fragment of \nMya truncate. This particular deposit may have originally formed in a glaciomarine \nenvironment during an early Devensian stadial as proposed by Sutherland (1981), but \nnot necessarily during a period of locally elevated sea level. \n \n3. Geological setting and stratigraphy of the Clava sediments \nThe geology and geomorphology of the Clava area has been described in detail by \nMerritt (1992) (also see Fletcher et al., 1996; British Geological Survey, 1997), and is, \ntherefore, only summarised here (Fig. 1). The variably deformed glacigenic sequence \nat Clava underlies a series of NE\u2013SW-trending benches (up to c. 265 m OD). These \nbenches slope gently both downstream and towards the centre of the Nairn valley, \nwith the lower ones having been modified by glacial drainage in an ice marginal \nsetting. The glacial sequence (up to 40 m thick) at Clava is complex, including tills, \nsands and gravels and thrust-bound rafts of shelly clay, shelly diamicton and \nglaciofluvial sand and gravel, with two important interglacial and interstadial sites \noccurring nearby (see Fig. 1). The sediments rest upon bedrock of Middle Devonian \nsandstones and conglomerates (Inverness Sandstone Group), unconformably \noverlying a basement of Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks intruded by younger \ngranites (Fletcher et al., 1996).  \n 4\nThe glacial sediments are exposed in a series of sections in the valleys of the \nCassie and Finglack burns (Fig. 1), but the full sequence can not be seen at any one \nsite as it has been dissected by a number of gently dipping thrusts and \u2018high strain \nzones\u2019. Consequently, establishing the original stratigraphical relationships between \nthe rafted units is problematic. The stratigraphy summarised in Table 1 follows that \nproposed by Merritt (1992) and Fletcher et al. (1996), rather than the more formal, \nless widely used nomenclature of Bowen (1999). Although the validity of applying \nformal lithostratigraphical rules to units that are only known from tectonically bound \nrafts may be questioned, the main three components of the rafts, namely Clava Shelly \nTill, Clava Shelly Clay and Clava Sand, have been defined as members within the \nClava Shelly Formation (Table 1). A newly defined fourth unit, the Clava Gravel, has \nbeen added here. \n \n4. Analytical techniques \nPrior to sampling the sedimentary sequences exposed in the Clava area were logged \nand the macro-scale characteristics of the sequence (e.g. geometry of the units, \nlithology, macroscopic deformation structures\u2026etc) were described in detail. A total \nof six orientated samples were collected from the glacigenic sediments exposed in \nCassie Burn and the top if the rafted sequence at the Clava Main Pit. Individual \nsamples were collected using 10 cm square, aluminium Kubiena tins, which were \neither cut or pushed into the face of each exposure in order to limit sample \ndisturbance. The geographical position, orientation relative to magnetic north, depth \nand way-up of the sample were marked on the outside of the tin during collection. \nEach sample was then removed from the face, sealed in two plastic bags, and then \nstored in a cold store to prevent the material from drying out prior to sample \npreparation. \n Sample preparation (total time c. 10 months involved the initial replacement of \npore-water by acetone, which was then progressively replaced by a resin and allowed \nto cure. The thin sections were cut orthogonal to bedding and to any deformation \nstructures evident from field investigation. The thin sections were examined using a \nstandard Zeiss petrological microscope and Zeiss projector, the latter allowing \ndetailed study of the range of microstructures at very low magnification. The \nterminology used to describe the various microstructures developed within these \n 5\nsediments in general follows that proposed by van der Meer (1987, 1993) and \nMenzies (2000). \n \n5. Stratigraphical relationships and macroscopic deformation structures \nThe oldest unit at Clava, the Cassie Till Formation (CTF) (Table 1), has only been \nproven in boreholes and is thought to be a pre-Late Devensian basal till (Merritt, \n1992). This till is overlain by the Drummore Gravel Formation (DGF), a sequence of \ncrudely stratified, very poorly sorted and clayey gravels containing pebbles and large \nblocks of Devonian sandstone. This gravel-rich unit (\u2264 3 m thick) crops out at the \nbase of the Finglack section [NH 7688 7422] (Fig. 2), where water-winnowed, silt-\nrich diamicton, interpreted as an ice-marginal or supraglacial debris flow deposit \n(Merritt, 1992), is overlain by folded and thrusted sediments of the Clava Shelly \nFormation (CSF). The sharp, planar contact between the two units represents a \nglacitectonic d\u00e9collement that developed at the base of the rafted CSF. The clay, silt \nand sands immediately above this thrust are similar in appearance to the upper part of \nthe Clava Shelly Clay Member (CSCM) at the Main Pit, but are highly deformed (a \nglacitectonite of Benn and Evans, 1998), showing evidence of several phases of \nfolding and faulting, as well as soft-sediment deformation (Fig. 2b). This \nglacitectonite is overlain by a dark grey pebbly diamicton, assigned to the Clava \nShelly Till Member (CSTM), which is separated from the overlying Finglack Till \nFormation (FTF) by a prominent, gently SE-dipping thrust zone (Fig. 2). Individual \nthrust planes within this zone are marked by thin layers of hard, sheared silty clay, \nwith the upper and lower bounding thrusts being separated by a \u2018high strain zone\u2019 \ncomposed of highly sheared clayey sand. \nIn Cassie Burn section III [NH 7637 4369] (Fig. 1), the rafted sequence is \ndeformed by a number of thrusts that truncate bedding and earlier developed folds \n(Fig. 3). The Clava Shelly Till and Clava Sand (CSM) members in the lower part of \nthe section are overlain by several metres of deformed (thrusted) sand and gravel \nidentified as glaciofluvial ice-contact deposits by Merritt (1992), referred to here as \nthe Clava Gravel Member (CGM) (Fig. 3; Table 1). The CGM comprises \npredominantly waterlain, poorly sorted, clast-supported gravel interbedded with \npebbly, medium to coarse sand. The gravel clasts are mostly composed of micaceous \nmetasandstone with subordinate semipelitic gneiss, brown sandstone and granitic \n 6\ngneiss, an apparently \u2018exotic\u2019 (not locally derived) suite of lithologies. The basal \ncontact of the CGM is a gently to moderately (c. 40\u00b0) NE-dipping thrust (Fig. 3). A \nsmall splay from this thrust deforms the upper part of the structurally underlying \nCSM. The tip of this thrust is marked by a tight, isoclinal fold, which is itself \ntruncated by a later reverse fault (Fig. 3c). A gently to steeply, NE-dipping \u2018\u2018\u2018high \nstrain zone\u2019\u2019\u2019 (\u2264 50 cm thick) near to the base of the CGM (Figs. 3 and 4) is \ncomposed of highly deformed, laminated clay and silt containing lenses or boudins of \nsand and diamicton (CSTM). \nThe CSTM (Table 1) is an olive grey, stiff, fissile, matrix-supported, silty \nclay-rich diamicton containing clasts of micaceous metasandstone, quartzite and \ngneiss, with lesser amounts of granite and Devonian sandstone. Apart from the clasts \nof sandstone, which are generally angular, others are rounded to well-rounded, \nmoderate to high sphericity, and polished, similar to the distinctive, exotic clast \nassemblage described in the CSCM at the Main Pit by Horne et al. (1894). The \ndifference in faunal assemblages between the CSCM and CSTM, however, show that \nthe till is not simply derived from disintegration of the glaciomarine clay during \nglaciation and rafting. In Cassie Burn section III, the CSTM includes a number of \ndiscrete masses of fissile, dark bluish grey clay, containing comminuted shells and \nsparse stones, which were \u2018cannibalised\u2019 from a pre-existing marine deposit. A \ncrudely developed layering in the diamicton is deformed by a SSW-verging, NE-\nplunging, asymmetrical fold (Fig. 3). At this location, the CSTM and structurally \noverlying CSM are separated by a gently dipping to subhorizontal thrust. This thrust \ntruncates a large monoclinal fold that deforms, and locally overturns bedding within \nthe sand (Figs. 3a and b). This relationship indicates that folding pre-dated thrusting. \nHowever, this does not necessarily imply that folding and thrusting represent \ncompletely separate deformation events. The CSM forms a thrust-bound wedge that \nthins rapidly to the NE where it is cut out against a thrust forming the base of the \noverlying CGM (Fig. 3). Soft-sediment deformation structures (flame structures, \ndisharmonic folds, convolute bedding) are common in the finer grained, lower part of \nthe CSM, indicative of locally high pore-water pressures\/contents during deformation. \nBedding in the sand unit is also locally offset by locally pervasively developed, small-\nscale, steeply dipping (50\u00b0-60\u00b0), conjugate normal faults. The CSCM is apparently \nmissing in section III, possibly having been excised during thrusting. \n 7\nIn the type section of the Clava Shelly Formation at the Main Pit (Fig. 1), the \nrafted sequence is much thicker and, in general, less deformed. It records a relatively \ncoherent, gently dipping, coarsening upwards sequence that extends at least 174 m in \nthe NE\u2013SW-direction (Horne et al., 1894). Borehole evidence indicates that the \nCSCM (4.9 m thick) rests directly upon the DGF, and comprises a sequence of \nweakly stratified, pebbly silt and clay (Horne et al., 1894). This clay dominated \nsequence also contains laminae of sand and streaks of black carbonaceous, as well as \nthin gravel beds with scoured bases and containing broken shells. The lamination is \nlocally offset by small-scale normal and reverse faults, and closely spaced shears \nbearing slickensides. \nAt the Main Pit, the CSCM is conformably overlain by the CSM, the basal 3 \nm thick unit of which comprises thinly bedded, yellowish brown, micaceous, silty \nfine-grained sand with sparse dropstones. The beds are normally graded and stacked \ninto packages about 40 cm thick, similar to those described in the younger Ardersier \nSilt Formation found towards the coast of the Moray Firth and interpreted as having \nbeen deposited in a glaciomarine fjord setting (Merritt et al., 1995). The uppermost \nunit (c. 3 m thick), comprises yellowish brown, massive to indistinctly laminated silty \nfine- to medium-grained sand with thin lenses of coarse-grained sand with scoured \nbases, and sparse dropstones. This sandy unit is cut by a number of bedding-parallel \nto steeply (60-80\u00b0) NE-dipping hydrofractures composed of finely laminated to \nbrecciated sand, silt and clay (Fig. 5). Individual sand and silt laminae (\u2264 1.5 cm \nthick) within the veins are graded, some containing intraformational rip-up clasts of \nsilt and clay. The veins (\u2264 15 cm thick) can be traced laterally for several metres and \nmost taper upwards (see Fig. 5). \nClose to the top of the sequence, the bedding within the CSM is deformed by \nseveral moderately to gently inclined folds and thrusts. These deformation structures \nare locally truncated by the hydrofractures (Fig. 5c), indicating that folding and \nthrusting pre-dated the formation of these water-escape features. At the base of the \noverlying FTF, the CSM is very highly deformed with bedding having been variably \ntransposed by a glacitectonic foliation. Parallel to the planar, subhorizontal base of the \ntill is a 40 cm thick zone of highly deformed, overconsolidated, silty fine-grained sand \ncontaining boudinaged lenses of diamicton, stringers of coarse sand and deformed \nfragments of clay. The hydrofractures present in the lower parts of the CSM are \n 8\nclearly truncated by this \u2018high strain zone\u2019 (Figs. 5a and c). This relationship indicates \nthat hydrofracturing occurred prior to ductile shearing. \n In the Finglack Burn section (Fig. 1), the conformable relationship between \nthe CSCM and CSM members has been strongly modified by thrusting, leading to the \nemplacement of CSTM onto the CSCM (Fig. 2). The thrust contact between these two \nunits was later deformed by open, upright to weakly asymmetrical folds (Fig. 2a). The \nrafted sediments are cut out towards the SE, where the FTF rests directly upon the \nDGF (Fig. 2). This locality is the type section of the FTF, which comprises a thick (at \nleast 8 m), massive unit of yellowish brown, stiff, matrix-supported, stony diamicton \nwith a matrix of clayey fine-grained sand. Like many tills overlying Devonian rocks \nin the vicinity, it contains mainly faceted and striated clasts of sandstone and \nmicaceous siltstone, many of which can be matched with strata cropping out \nimmediately to the W or SW of the site. The basal few metres of the till contains \nrelatively abundant, well-rounded, high-sphericity and commonly polished pebbles of \nmicaceous metasandstone. The basal contact of the till is formed by a \u2018\u2018high strain \nzone\u2019\u2019 (Fig. 2) similar to the one present within the Main Pit section. \n In Cassie Burn section VI (Fig 1), only the FTF is exposed. At this locality \nthe basal part of the till is locally cut by a ramifying network of interconnecting to \ncross-cutting hydrofractures filled by finely laminated sand, silt and clay (Fig. 6). In \nCassie Burn section III, the exposed FTF is relatively inaccessible and rests upon a \ntectonically thickened sequence of CGM (Fig. 3). \n \n6. Micromorphology and microscopic deformation structures \nOrientated samples (N4691; N4692; N4693; N4694; N4695; N4696) were collected \nto examine the range of microscopic deformation structures developed within the \nglacigenic sediments of Cassie Burn section III (Figs. 3 and 4) and those exposed at \nthe top of the rafted sequence at the Main Pit (Fig. 5).  \n \n6.1. High strain zones \nSample N4691 was taken from the prominent \u2018high strain zone\u2019 near the base of the \nCGM in Cassie Burn section III (see Figs. 3a and 4). In thin section the zone is \ncomposed of alternating layers of variably deformed and disrupted, fine to medium \nsand and silt, with minor clay intercalations (Fig. 7a). Although, in outcrop, the \nlayering within the \u2018high strain zone\u2019 is apparently glacitectonic, many of the sand \n 9\nand silt layers are graded (fining or coarsening upwards), indicative of deposition by \nwater. The relationships between individual sand and silt layers are complex, \nsuggesting that the layering is not simply sedimentary in origin. For example, in the \nupper part of thin section, a thick layer of laminated and graded sand and silt is cross-\ncut by an inclined band (5-6 mm thick) of pale, matrix-poor sand, which is itself cut \nby a bifurcating clay-filled water-escape conduit (Fig. 7a). Elsewhere in sample \nN4691, the lamination within the sands is either diffuse or patchily \ndeveloped\/preserved, with the sediment possessing a mottled appearance, compatible \nwith liquefaction and remobilisation (Phillips et al., 2007).  \nThe clay-rich layers are composed of finely laminated silt and clay, with thin \nlenticles of cement\/matrix-supported fine to coarse sand. The clay is highly \nbirefringent (clay cutan) and possesses a well-developed layer-parallel plasmic fabric. \nThis fabric is deformed by kink-like folds and shears, the latter defining an \nanastomosing network of small-scale, SE-directed thrusts. Thrusting preferentially \noccurred within the clay layers with the adjacent sands being little affected by this \ndeformation. Individual sand laminae were observed locally cross-cutting the thrusts \n(Fig. 7). Both the thrusts and sand layers are off-set by a number of gently to \nmoderately dipping normal and reverse faults (Fig. 7a). The sense of movement on \nthe reverse faults, like the thrusts, is towards the SE. The faults also deform the clay-\nfilled water-escape conduits and, therefore, post-date both thrusting and \nhydrofracturing. \n \n6.2. Clava Shelly Till Member \nIn thin section (N4692) the Clava Shelly Till Member is a massive, fine-grained, \nmatrix-supported, diamicton with a fine silty clay matrix containing well-dispersed \ngranule to pebble-sized metamorphic and granitic rock fragments Rare shell \nfragments (gastropod) and sparse till pebbles are also present. The larger clasts are \nenclosed within an envelope or coating of clay which locally possesses a well-\ndeveloped skelsepic plasmic fabric. Two generations of planar plasmic fabrics have \nbeen recognised within the matrix of the till: (i) a weakly to moderately developed, \nlayer-parallel foliation defined by optically aligned clay plasma and detrital micas; \nand (ii) a second, steeply inclined (unistrial) fabric defining a number of narrow \nshears. The shears have poorly defined margins and post-date the main, layer-parallel \nfoliation. Rare circular to arcuate grain arrangements (rotational structures) are \n 10\npresent enclosing larger granules and pebbles. No other microscopic deformation \nstructures (folds, faults) have been noted. \n \n6.3. Hydrofractures \nHydrofractures are a relatively common feature within the sequence exposed at Clava, \noccurring within both the CSM and FTF. No samples were obtained from the FTF due \nto the highly overconsolidated nature of this subglacial diamicton. Four orientated \nsamples (N4693; N4694; N4695; N4696) were, however, taken from a laterally \nextensive hydrofracture system cutting the CSM exposed in the Main Pit. Field \nevidence shows that this hydrofracture system truncates the earlier developed folds \nand thrusts, but is itself truncated by the \u2018high strain zone\u2019 at the base of the overlying \nFTF. Samples N4693, N4694 and N4695 represent the layer-parallel section of this \nsystem (Fig. 5b), whereas sample N4696 occurs at a structurally higher position \nwithin the steeply inclined portion of the hydrofracture system (Fig 5c; also see Fig. \n10).  \nThe thin sections are all composed of variably deformed, laminated sand, silt \nand clay (Figs. 7b, 8a and 8b), which represent a combination of the host CSM and \nfluidised sediment injected into the hydrofracture system. The clay-rich layers are \ncomposed of finely laminated silt and clay, with thin lenticles and irregular patches of \ncoarse to medium, matrix-supported sand (CS1 on Figs. 7b, 8b and 9). The thicker \nclay-silt laminae are graded (fining upwards) and possess a well-developed bedding-\nparallel plasmic fabric. Both the lamination and plasmic fabric are deformed by an \nanastomosing network of bedding-parallel to gently dipping thrusts, and at least one \nset of normal and reverse microfaults (Figs. 7b and 8a). Thrusting preferentially \noccurred within the clay layers. However, the adjacent sands showing little evidence \nof this deformation and locally cross-cut and, therefore, post-date the thrusts. In \nsamples N4695 and N4696, thrusting was accompanied by localised disharmonic \nfolding and brecciation of the clay layers (Figs. 8b and 9). The brecciated layers \ncomprise angular, randomly orientated fragments of silt and clay within a matrix of \ncement-supported sand and silt. The brecciated layers are cut by more massive sands \n(e.g. SS1 and SS3 on Fig. 8b) that are unaffected by this brittle deformation. \nHowever, in samples N4693 and N4694, the equivalent sands are cut by a layer-\nparallel to locally transgressive water-escape feature filled by a lithologically similar \nclay-rich microbreccia (MB on Figs. 7b, 8a and 10). \n 11\nThe layers of fine to coarse sand are massive to weakly laminated with a \nvariably developed normal (fining upwards) or reverse (coarsening upwards) grading. \nThe margins of the sand layers are sharp, ranging from planar, to locally irregular, \n\u2018sutured\u2019, or even flame-like. A number of the thicker sands clearly truncate the \nlamination and thrusts developed within the adjacent silts and clays (see Figs. 7b, 8a \nand 8b); consistent with the liquefaction, remobilisation and injection of the coarser \ngrained sediments. In general, the sands are undeformed. However, in sample N4694 \nthe margins of some sand layers are modified by thrusting and are locally offset by a \nset of later normal and reverse faults (Fig. 8a). \nThe lower right-hand of sample N4693 is cut by a 20 to 30 mm wide, NE-\ndipping (40-50\u00b0) water-escape conduit filled by cross-cutting fills of massive to \nweakly laminated sand (F2 on Figs. 7b and 10). This feature is correlated with a more \nshallowly (5-10\u00b0) dipping conduit present in the upper part of sample N4694 (F2 on \nFigs. 8a and 10). Later, vein-like hydrofractures composed of laminated fine sand, silt \nand clay (LV1 and LV2 on Figs. 7b, 8a and 10) truncate the earlier sand-dominated \nfill. These relationships are consistent with the water-escape conduit having \naccommodated several phases of fluid flow. \nSamples N4693 and N4695 are both cut by steeply (70-80\u00b0) inclined \nhydrofractures that clearly truncate the layering within the host sediments, as well as \nan earlier sand-filled water-escape conduit (see Fig. 10). In both samples, the later \nhydrofractures possess multiple generations of sediment fill (Table 2). The earliest fill \nis a microbreccia composed of angular, variably deformed fragments of clay and silt \nin a silty sand matrix (HF1 on Figs. 7b and 8b). This microbreccia is cut by a complex \nvein-like network of sand and highly birefringent clay (HF2 on Figs. 7b and 8a, Table \n2). In sample N9463, the earlier fills are cut by a vein of highly birefringent, red-\nbrown clay (HF3 on Fig. 7b, Table 2). In marked contrast to this clay-rich fill, in \nsample N4695, the final flow event resulted in the deposition of weakly laminated to \nmassive sand (SS7 on Fig. 8b, Table 2). This sand-fill is connected to a lithologically \nsimilar sand layer present at the bottom of the thin section (Fig. 8b). \nIn the subvertical part of the hydrofracture system, represented by sample \nN4696, the hydrofracture is funnel-shaped (widening upwards) and comprises a \nmultiphase fill of clay, silt and sand (Figs. 9 and 10, Table 2). Unlike the layer-\nparallel part of the hydrofracture system (represented by samples N4693, N4694 and \n 12\nN4695), this near vertical section is associated with locally intense brecciation of the \nadjacent sediments. Fragmentation was accompanied the injection of irregular patches \nand veinlets of coarse sand (CS1, CS2 and CS3 on Fig. 9). The distribution pattern of \nthe coarse sand fills suggests that the pressurised fluidised sand \u2018radiate outward\u2019 \n(upwards) from a central conduit (see Fig. 10). The normal microfaults in the \nsediment wall of the hydrofracture downthrow towards the centre of the conduit (Fig \n9). It is likely that faulting occurred in response to the collapse within this funnel-\nshaped hydrofracture system after fluid flow had ceased. The main part of the conduit \nis filled by a complex network of sand, silt and clay veins (HF1, HF2 and HF3 on Fig. \n9). A diffuse, poorly preserved lamination within the sand (HF1) is deformed by a \nnumber of rootless disharmonic folds. The later silt- and clay-rich fills (HF2 and HF3) \nform a cross-cutting, vein-like network. A well-developed plasmic fabric within the \nclay-rich fill occurs parallel to the margins of the hydrofracture and probably formed \nin response to the adhering of the clay plasma to the margins of the fracture. The \nearlier fills are cut by small, patches or veins of sand (SS7 on Fig. 9). \n \n7. Macroscopic structural interpretation \nThe relative positions and major structures developed within the glacigenic sequences \nexposed within the Finglack Burn, Clava Main Pit and Cassie Burn sections are \nshown in Fig. 11 (also see Fig. 12a). the overall geometry of the main thrusts and \n\u2018high strain zones\u2019 developed within these polydeformed sediments is consistent with \nthe rafts of Clava Shelly Formation forming a lenticular duplex-like structure which \nformed adjacent to a bedrock high located on the SE side of the Nairn river valley. \nThis assemblage of rafts occurs within an envelope that is in the order of 900 m long \nby 300 m wide (Fig. 12), and a few tens of metres thick.  \n The major bounding structures of the duplex are formed by the \u2018high strain \nzones\u2019 which dissect the Clava succession. On Fig. 11 these shear zones divide the \nClava Shelly Formation into two discrete rafts; a structurally lower raft composed of \nthe polydeformed CSCM, CSTM and CSM, with the higher raft being solely \ncomposed of the variably deformed (thrusted) sands and gravels of the CGM. The \nupper bounding surface of the duplex is formed by the prominent \u2018high strain zone\u2019 at \nthe base of the Finglack Till Formation (Fig. 11). The basal d\u00e9collement surface \nseparating the Clava Shelly Formation from the underlying Drummore Gravel \nFormation can be seen in the Finglack Burn section. This section occurs close to the \n 13\n\u2018tip\u2019 of the duplex (see Fig. 11) with the sediments recording the most intense \ndeformation, leading to the formation of a polydeformed glacitectonite from the \nCSCM.  \nThe upper raft at Clava is exposed within Cassie Burn section III and thins towards \nthe SE, where it maybe pinched out by the merging of two highs train zones (Fig. 11). \nThe basal detachment to this raft is formed by the gently to steeply, NE-dipping \n\u2018\u2018high strain zone\u2019\u2019 which occurs near to the base of the CGM (Figs. 3, 4 and 11). The \nsequences exposed within the Clava main Pit and lower part of Cassie Burn section III \noccur towards the centre of the structurally lower raft (Figs 11 and 12a). although less \ndeformed, leading to the local preservation of original stratigraphical relationships, \nthese sediments have clearly undergone several phases of folding and thrusting. This \ndoes not necessarily imply that folding and thrusting represent completely separate \ndeformation events. The southerly verging folds which deform the \nstratification\/bedding within the CSTM and CSM are truncated by a number of later, \nsubhorizontal to moderately northerly-dipping thrusts (Figs 3 and 11). These SE-\ndirected brittle structures form the boundaries between slices of CSTM, CSM and \nCGF, overprinting the original stratigraphical relationships between these units and \nleading to the imbrication\/stacking of the sediments within the lower raft. The thrusts \nare sharp, planar features, lacking the apparently intense zone of ductile shearing \nwhich characterise the main bounding surfaces of the duplex. The thrusts are locally \nfolded (e.g. Finglack Burn Cassie Burn section III, Fig. 11) recording further \ncompression\/shortening, possibly associated with the transport of the rafts. In \nFinglack Burn and upper part of the Main Pit section, the folds and thrusts which \ndeform the Clava Shelly Formation are truncated by the \u2018high strain zones\u2019 which \nform the bounding surfaces of the raft (Figs. 2 and 11). These relationships indicate \nthat folding and thrusting predated the main phase of ductile movement along the \n\u2018high strain zones\u2019. It is possible that this early folding and thrusting event occurred \nduring either the initial detachment of the rafts or during the earlier part of their \ntransport history. \n Hydrofracturing is locally a common feature both within the ice-rafted Clava \nShelly Formation and structurally overlying Finglack Till Formation. In the Main Pit, \nthe bedding-parallel to steeply NE-dipping Hydrofractures clearly cross-cut the early \ndeveloped folds and thrusts present within the CSM, demonstrating that water-escape \npost-dated folding and thrusting (Fig. 5). The Hydrofractures are, however, truncated \n 14\nby the \u2018high strain zone\u2019 at the base of the FTF (Figs. 5a and c), showing that is phase \nof water-escape occurred prior to ductile shearing at the base of the till. In the Cassie \nBurn section VI, the lower part of the FTF is cut by a network of sand-filled \nHydrofractures (Fig. 6), possibly recording a separate phase of water-escape which \npost-dated the deposition of the till. These complex relationships are interpreted as \nrecording several phases of Hydrofracturing and water-escape during rafting. The \nearliest phase occurred after initial folding of the Clava succession, but prior to al \nleast the later phases of ductile shearing along the upper boundary of the duplex. The \nlater phase of water-escape apparently post-dated this shear event and affected the \nlower parts of the Finglack Till Formation. This latter phase of water-escape possibly \noccurred during the later stages of accretion of the rafts as the glacier overrode the \ntopographic high formed by the SE side of the Nairn river valley. \n \n8. Micromorphological evidence of multiphase liquefaction and water-escape \nduring deformation \nIt is clear from the above description that liquefaction, remobilisation and injection of \nthe sand, silt and, to a lesser extent, clay played an important role during the \ndeformation of the glacigenic sedimentary sequence exposed at Clava.  \n \n8.1. High strain zones \nThe influence of relatively high pore-water contents and\/or pressures was not \nconfined to the formation of hydrofractures, but has also been recognised within the \n\u2018high strain zones\u2019 that dissect the Clava succession. These zones represent major \nd\u00e9collement surfaces, cutting out and repeating parts of the succession (see Figs. 2, 3 \nand 11). Although field observations suggest that these structures possess a well-\ndeveloped glacitectonic foliation, micromorphological analysis (N4691) has revealed \nthat the intensity of deformation recorded by these zones is much lower than \nexpected. Importantly, the range of microtextures present within one of the \u2018high \nstrain zones\u2019 is similar to those developed within the hydrofracture system sampled \nfrom the Main Pit (compare Fig. 7a with Figs. 7b to 10). The absence of deformation \nand presence of normal and reverse grading within the locally cross-cutting sand \nlayers indicates that, rather than being tectonic, the fine-scale layering within the \n\u2018high strain zones\u2019 was (at least in part) formed by the injection of fluidised sediment \nparallel to the margins of these structures. Deformation, where present, was relatively \n 15\nearly and dominated by thrusting, within the clay-rich layers (Fig. 7a). The presence \nof clay-filled water-escape features (hydrofractures) provides further evidence that the \n\u2018high strain zones\u2019 periodically acted as a focus for subsequent fluid flow. Repeated \nphases of liquefaction and remobilisation in response to fluctuating pore-water \ncontent and\/or pressure would have resulted in the overprinting of any earlier formed \nthrusts or folds.  \nThe periodic introduction of pressurised fluidised sediment into the \u2018high \nstrain zones\u2019 would have resulted in a reduction in the shear strength of the sediments, \ntherefore, aiding displacement. The increase in pore-water pressure during injection of \nthe fluidised material into the shear zone could have acted as a \u2018hydrogeological jack\u2019, \nresulting in the effective decoupling of the margins of the rafts from the surrounding \nsediments. One significant effect of this decoupling would have been to increase the \npreservation potential of the soft-sediment rafts during an extended period of \ntransport. The fluctuation in fluid flow, possibly reflecting a seasonal variation in melt \nwater production, would have led to a \u2018stick-slip\u2019 pattern of movement. The presence \nof water lubricated detachments within the deforming bed of the glacier would have \nassisted in the transportation of the raft from its source (see discussion). Shear \nimposed by the overriding glacier would have been preferentially partitioned into \nthese water lubricated d\u00e9collement surfaces, effectively \u2018switching off\u2019 deformation in \nthe adjacent hanging wall and footwall. This would have contributed to the \npreservation of primary stratigraphical relationships within the thicker parts of the ice \nrafted sequence (Main Pit), concentrating deformation along the margins of the raft.  \n \n8.2. Hydrofractures \nHydrofractures are a relatively common feature at Clava. Field relationships indicate \nthat hydrofracturing of the CSM post-dated folding and thrusting, but predated \nshearing at the base of the overlying FTM. The locally ramifying network of \nhydrofractures developed within the till, however, shows that hydrofracturing and \nwater-escape continued after ductile shearing and till deposition had ceased. \nMicromorphological evidence from one hydrofracture system within the CSM \nshows that these structures do not represent a single \u2018flow event\u2019, but have \naccommodated several phases\/pulses of water-escape. The cross-cutting relationships \ndisplayed between the various generations of sand, silt and clay-fills, and their \nrelationship to the folds and thrusts developed within the host sediments has enabled a \n 16\ndetailed chronology of events to be erected for each sample (Table 2). The key \nrelationships between the various generations of sediment fill are shown in Fig. 10. \nThe complex history of liquefaction and deformation recorded within the \nhydrofracture system can be simplified into four main events:  \nEvent I - An early phase of layer-parallel thrusting with associated folding and \nductile shearing which was preferentially partitioned into the laminated clay-rich host \nsediments (see Fig. 10);  \nEvent II - Repeated injection of fluidised sediment parallel to bedding\/layering \nin the host sands, resulting in the formation of a relatively wide zone of fluid flow. \nThis injection was accompanied by minor thrusting and\/or faulting;  \nEvent III - Development of broad water-escape conduits (e.g. F2 on Fig. 10) \ncross-cutting the earlier developed layering and possibly recording the concentration \nof fluid flow into narrow zones within the overall hydrofracture system;  \nEvent IV - Late stage hydrofracturing with sand, silt and clay-filled \nhydrofractures cross-cutting the earlier formed features (e.g. HF2\/3, LV1 and LV2 on \nFig. 10). \nMicrostructural analysis supports the macroscopic field evidence that the main \nphase of thrusting and folding within the CSM predated hydrofracturing and water-\nescape. However, in thin section (N4695), the thrusting was accompanied locally by \ndisharmonic folding and brecciation. The brecciated areas are cut by small-scale, silt-\nfilled water-escape conduits and patches of coarse matrix-supported sand. These \nrelationships suggest that even at an early stage of the deformation history, the \nsediments at Clava where undergoing localised liquefaction and remobilisation. \nThrusting was followed by the repeated injection of thin layers or laminae of \nfluidised sand parallel to bedding in the host sediments (Event II, Table 2). Earlier \nformed thrusts may, in some cases, have formed the focus for fluid flow during this \nphase of water-escape. The margins of the subhorizontal part of the hydrofracture \nsystem are difficult to define, suggesting that this zone of fluid flow may have \ninitially been rather diffuse. The laminated and graded nature of individual sand \nlayers indicates that the flow regime changed during deposition, reflecting \nfluctuations in pore-water pressure. Individual \u2018flow events\u2019 may have commenced \nwith the injection of highly pressurised water\/fluidised sediment leading to the initial \n\u2018opening\u2019 of a conduit within the hydrofracture system. As pore-water pressure \ndecreased the velocity of the water flow would have waned leading to the deposition \n 17\nof the graded sediment fill, therefore, sealing the conduit. The observed cross-cutting \nrelationships between individual sand layers indicate that the injection of each pulse \nof fluidised sand was followed by a fall in relative pore-water pressure. This suggests \nthat water was able to drain out of the sediments and, consequently, it is unlikely that \nhigh pore-water pressures were continually maintained during deformation. The \nfrequency of the individual \u2018flow events\u2019 may have shown larger-scale variation in \nresponse to seasonal fluctuations in melt water production (i.e. the hydrofracture \nsystem would have been more \u2018active\u2019 during the summer). \nAs deformation continued, fluid flow appears to have been concentrated into \nnarrower zones within the overall hydrofracture system, leading to the injection of \ndiscrete, layer-parallel to transgressive sand-filled water-escape conduits (Event III, \nTable 2). These internally complex features accommodated several phases of fluid \nflow and sediment fills (see Figs. 7b, 8a and 10, Table 2). The margins of these vein-\nlike structures are sharp suggesting that pore-water pressure\/content in the sand had \nfallen prior to veining, hence, allowing the propagation of an \u2018open\u2019 fracture through \noriginally liquefied sand.  \nThe final event (Event IV, Table 2) resulted in the development of steeply \ninclined hydrofractures (Figs. 7b, 8b, 9) which truncate all the deformation and water-\nescape features. Once again, hydrofracture developed during Event IV records a \nmultiphase history of fluid flow and comprise a complex sequence of cross-cutting \nsand, silt and clay fills (Figs. 8b, 9 and 10, Table 2). Although the samples were \ncollected from different structural positions along the main hydrofracture system, the \nsimilarity in morphology and composition of the fills suggests that they developed \nduring the same event. The earliest phases of fill are only locally preserved. In sample \nN4696, the early coarse sand fills (CS1, CS2, CS3 on Fig. 9) are absent in the lower \npart of the hydrofracture (see Fig. 10). This may be due to a lack of sediment \ndeposition in this part of the fracture or, alternatively, the \u2018flushing out\u2019 of the early \nsandy fills during a subsequent phase of fluid flow. The over pressurised nature of the \nescaping water-sediment-mix resulted in the localised brecciation of the host \nsediments (Figs. 7b and 9), as well as disharmonic folding and minor drag folding of \nearlier fills and adjacent sediment wall (Figs. 8b and 9) due to the force\/shear exerted \nby the escaping water\/liquefied sediment. Normal faulting within the wall of the \nhydrofracture (e.g. N4696) probably occurred in response to the collapse of this \nfunnel-shaped conduit after flow had ceased. The combination of brecciated walls and \n 18\nevacuation of sediment filling the conduit during a subsequent flow event would have \nled to this instability and collapse. The introduction of clay-rich sediment fills (Figs. \n7b and 9) would have helped stabilise the walls of the hydrofracture system. The \nadhering of clay plasma to the margins of the fracture, leading to the development of a \nwell-developed plasmic fabric, would have armoured the adjacent sediments \nprotecting them from erosion and effectively \u2018cementing\u2019 the fracture walls.  \n \n9. Original depositional setting of the rafted sediments at Clava \nMerritt (1992) concluded that the composition and upwards-increasing grain size of \nthe sediments exposed within the Main Pit at Clava, together with decreasing salinity \ninferred from the dinoflagellate cysts within the CSCM (Graham et al., 1992), \nsuggests that the original sequence records the encroachment of a delta or subaqueous \nfan into the Loch Ness basin, then a marine fjord. The faunal assemblage within the \nCSCM and available dating evidence suggests that deposition followed a period of \nglacial retreat and lowering of local sea level within a mid-Devensian interstadial.  \nThe composition of the CGM (Cassie Burn section III), which forms the upper \nraft recognised at Clava (see Fig. 11) closely matches stones found within the \nstructurally underlying CSTM and CSCM (Merritt, 19992). A significant proportion \nof the gravel (c. 9 modal %) comprises a granitic gneiss that is lithologically similar to \nrocks exposed in the Glen Moriston\/Fort Augustus area at the SW end of Loch Ness, \nsome 50 km to the SW of Clava. The CGM is, therefore, thought to have formed the \nuppermost unit of the coarsening-upward sequence as it prograded into the Loch Ness \nbasin. The distance between the site of deposition of the CGM and remainder of the \nClava Shelly Formation within the Great Glen, to the site of accretion of these \nallochthonous rafts at Clava indicates a minimum distance of tectonic transport of c. \n50 km. The possible path taken by these rafts, based upon the regional pattern of ice \nmovement, is shown in Fig. 12. \nSissons (1967) claimed that an erratic of supposed Jurassic rock in the CSCM \nindicated that the material had been transported southwards from the Moray Firth (by \na glacier flowing out of the Beauly Firth). However, there is no corroborating \nevidence in support of this model. The Beauly Glacier was involved in a late-stage \nreadvance in the Inverness district (Ardersier Readvance), depositing indicator \nerratics of the distinctive \u2018Inchbae\u2019 granitic gneiss (Merritt et al., 1995). However, \n 19\nnone of these erratics have been reported from the succession at Clava, or surrounding \narea. \n \n10. Discussion: glacitectonic model for rafting at Clava \nThe dimensions and general subhorizontal aspect of the assemblage of rafts exposed \nat Clava, coupled with the associated thrusting and large-scale folding of these bodies, \nare typical of many glacially-transported rafts described in the literature (see Stalker, \n1976; Moran et al., 1980; Bluemle and Clayton, 1984; Aber, 1985, 1988; \nRuszczynska-Szenajch, 1987; Broster and Seaman, 1991; Benn and Evans, 1998). In \nNorth America, large-scale rafts, \u2018megablocks\u2019 or \u2018pancake rocks\u2019 occur within areas \nof glacial-thrust terrain (Moran et al., 1980), with the thrusted rafts of bedrock having \nbeen transported near to the base, or in front of the advancing glacier (referred to as \nglacitectonic rafts by Ruszczynska-Szenajch, 1987). The degree of internal \ndeformation within these rafts is thought to be dependant upon their competence \nrelative to that of the enclosing material (e.g. ice) and to the distance travelled. Aber \n(1985) concluded that unless soft sedimentary rafts remain deeply frozen they will be \ndistorted and ultimately loose their identity due to subglacial shearing and\/or \nproglacial deformation. These frozen rafts, therefore, should only survive transport for \na limited duration as they are liable to thaw, break apart and homogenise during \ntransportation.  \nAt Clava, however, there is no clear evidence that the rafts of shelly \nglaciomarine sediments were frozen at any time during their history of entrainment, \ntransport and final accretion\/deposition. Rather, both macro- and microscopic \nevidence indicates that liquefaction, hydrofracturing and water-escape occurred \nrepeatedly during deformation of the sequence, recording the fluctuation pore-water \npressure\/content during rafting. This evidence, coupled with the presence of large-\nscale detachments within the sequence, has resulted the development of a purely \nglacitectonic model for the rafting and emplacement of the marine sediments at Clava \n(Fig. 13). \n \n10.1. Initial detachment of the rafts \nThe ice rafted sequence at Clava is thought to have originally been deposited \nby a delta or subaqueous fan as it prograded into the Loch Ness basin, which was a \nmarine fjord at the time.  Macroscopic field evidence and microstructural analysis \n 20\nreveal that the earliest phase of deformation (Event I, Table 20 recorded by these \nsediments resulted in folding, followed by thrusting. This sequence is thought to \nrecord a progression from the onset of ice-push (folding) as the outlet glacier \ncommenced its advance NE-ward along the Great Glen, through to further shortening \nof the sedimentary pile (thrusting) as the ice continued to impinge and override this \ndeltaic sequence (Figs 12 and 13). Initial detachment of the rafts of Clava Shelly \nFormation is thought to have occurred during this thrusting event, probably in a sub-\nmarginal to immediately proglacial setting (Fig. 13). Thrusting appears to effected the \nwhole of the sediment pile within the fjord resulting in the incorporation of the \nunderlying glaciomarine sediments into the thrust stack, these later becoming \ndeformed into the CSTM. The detached sediment slabs were subsequently completely \nover-ridden as the glacier continued to advance NE along the Great Glen. \nMoran (1971), Banham (1975) and Moran et al. (1980) have argued that the \ncombination of high pore-water pressures and interlayered permeable and \nimpermeable strata provide optimal conditions for the detachment of rafts. Merritt \n(1992) suggested that drainage in front of the advancing Great Glen Glacier may have \nbeen impeded by the presence of the outlet glacier flowing out of the Beauly Firth \n(Merritt, 1992, fig. 7). This restricted drainage would have assisted in the \ndevelopment of high pore-water contents within the deforming sediments. \nFurthermore, the subaqueous depositional setting of the Clava Shelly Formation may \nhave attributed to the water-saturated nature of the sediments at the time of \ndeformation. The migration of pore-water through the formation would have been \nretarded by the presence of impermeable layers, such as the CSCM and CSTM, \nallowing the build up of pore-water pressures. However, macroscopic field and \nmicromorphological evidence clearly demonstrated that Hydrofracturing, liquefaction \nand water-escape did not occur until a much later stage in the deformation history \n(Events 2 to 4, Table 2) recorded at Clava. Consequently, thrusting of the sediment \npile, which occurred early in the deformation sequence, is more likely to have resulted \nin the initial detachment of the rafts. A proglacial to ice marginal setting for this \nthrusting event would have allowed the sediments to dewater, maintaining a relatively \nlow pore-water pressure during the early states of deformation and initial detachment. \n \n10.2. Transport of the ice-rafted sediments \n 21\nThe rafts at Clava have been transported some 50 km from their site of deposition \nwithin the Great Glen prior to their eventual accretion on the SE side of the Nairn \nriver Valley (Fig. 12). This arcuate transport trajectory developed in response to the \nGreat Glen glacier being deflected eastwards by a more powerful outlet glacier \nflowing out of the Beauly Firth (Merritt, 1992). The overall effect was to force the \nGreat Glen ice to climb out of the glen, transporting the soft-sediment rafts over the \nhigher ground of Drumnossie Muir to the south and east (Fig. 12). \n One a raft has become detached many of the published models suggest that it \nis transported by incorporation into the base of a glacier (Clayton and Moran, 1974; \nBluemle and Clayton, 1984). This requires a compressive flow regime within the \nglacier, leading to an upward component of motion allowing the rafts to be sheared \ninto the base of the ice as a result of the decreased effective stress caused by elevated \npore-water pressure (Bluemle and Clayton, 1984). At Clava, however, there is no \ndirect evidence for the rafts having been included into the base of the advancing Great \nGlen glacier. In fact the rafted sediments all occur structurally below the subglacial \nFTF with was deposited below the Great Glen glacier as it expanded SE across the \nClava area (see Fig. 12c). Consequently, an alternative glacitectonic transport model \nis offered in which the thrusts and related \u2018high strain zones\u2019 that form the margins to \nthe envelope of rafts continued to accommodate displacement during transport. The \noccurrence of thrust-bound slivers of CSTM within the structurally lower rafts at \nClava (Fig. 11), further suggests that the transport phase of rafting occurred in a \nsubglacial to sub-marginal setting (Fig. 13). \n Although soft-sediment deformation, hydrofracturing and liquefaction can \noccur in both subglacially and proglacially deformed sequences (Rijsdijk et al., 1999; \nBaroni and Fasano, 2006), work by Phillips et al. (2007) suggests that structures \nequated with high pore-water pressures and contents may be more widely\/pervasively \ndeveloped in subglacially deformed sediments. At Clava folding and thrusting, which \nled to initial detachment of the rafts, were followed by several phases of liquefaction \nand water-escape, and the formation of a locally complex network of sediment-filled \nhydrofractures (Events 2 to 4, Table 2). These fluidisation events accompanied \ncontinued movement along the \u2018high strain zones\u2019 which form the major bounding \nstructures to the rafts (see Fig. 11). Micromorphological evidence indicates that these \nstructures acted as a focus for water-escape (inset Fig. 13) which led to the repeated \ninjection of fluidised sand and silt into these actively deforming structures. This \n 22\nconcentration of fluid flow along the margins of the rafts may have been assisted by \nthe relatively clayey to silty nature of some of the sediments within the Clava Shelly \nFormation (such as the CSCM and CSTM). However, the occurrence of complex \nhydrofracture systems within the CSM, with their multiple sediment fills (Fig. 10), \nindicates that pore-water pressure within the rafts repeatedly exceeded the cohesive \nstrength of these sediments. It is possible that these complex, apparently \u2018long lived\u2019 \nsystems were partially fed by pore-water introduced from outside the raft (inset Fig. \n13). Elevated pore-water pressures within the CSM may have been generated either in \nresponse to the tectonic thickening of the sedimentary pile and\/or the increased \nconfining pressure exerted by the overriding Great Glen glacier. \n The periodic introduction of pressurised fluidised sediment along the \u2018high \nstrain zones\u2019 would have led to a reduction in the shear strength of the sediment pile, \naiding displacement of the rafts, and effectively decoupling these soft-sediment slabs \nfrom the surrounding host sediments. Any shear induced by the overriding glacier \nwould have been partitioned into the \u2018high strain zones\u2019, concentrating deformation \nalong the margins of the rafts and essentially \u2018switching off\u2019 deformation within these \nbodies. This would lead to an increase in the preservation potential of the soft-\nsediments rafts during transport. The decoupling of the rafts from the remainder of the \nglacier bed would have allowed these soft-sediment slabs to be propelled forwards \nencased within a thin, periodically highly mobile (dilated), water lubricated envelope; \nanalogous to the effect achieved by trying to squeeze an orange or lemon pip between \nyour thumb and forefinger. Fluctuations in fluid flow, possibly in response to seasonal \nvariations in melt water production, would have led to a \u2018stick-slip\u2019 pattern of \nmovement along these detachment surfaces during transport. A fall in pore-water \npressure probably accompanied renewed deformation of the sediments within then \nraft, possibly accounting for the locally developed conjugate normal and reverse \nfaults, and localised folding of earlier developed thrusts within the lower of the two \nrafts exposed at Clava (see Fig. 11). \n \n10.3. Emplacement or accretion of the rafts \nEmplacement or accretion of the rafts at Clava occurred on the up-glacier side of a \nrise in bedrock topography on the SE side of the Nairn valley. This feature \ncorresponds with a major change in bedrock geology from Devonian Inverness \nSandstone Group , in the NW, to much less permeable Neoproterozoic metamorphic \n 23\nrocks intruded by granites to the SE (Fletcher et al., 1996; British Geological Survey, \n1997). This variation in bedrock geology would have probably resulted in a marked \nchange in subglacial hydrogeology. In contrast to the impermeable upland areas to the \nSE of the Nairn valley, the low-lying Loch Ness and Inner Moray Firth basins were \npotentially situated close to sea-level and developed upon permeable sandstone \nbedrock, allowing long-lived wet conditions to prevail. The rafts were accreted \nagainst the bedrock high as a result of the Great Glen glacier being forced SE-ward by \nice issuing from the Beauly Firth (Fig. 12c) (cf. Horne et al., 1894; Merritt, 1992). \nThis emplacement direction is consistent with the sense of displacement (to the SE) \nrecorded by the thrusts and related \u2018high strain zones\u2019 which deform the Clava \nsequence. Accretion of the duplex-like, thrust-bound assemblage of rafts (Figs. 11 and \n13) would have aided in the Great Glen glacier overcoming the bedrock high. The \naccretion process was, therefore, predominantly glacitectonic and probably \naccompanied deposition and penecontemporaneous shearing of the basal part of the \nFTF (Fig. 11). \nMerritt (1992) concluded that emplacement occurred whilst the Clava site was \ntemporarily situated within the marginal, cold-based zone of the expanding Late-\nDevensian Scottish ice sheet. Shortly afterwards, as the ice advanced NE-wards, \nwarm-based conditions prevailed, allowing subglacial shearing and subsequent basal \nsliding (cf. Moran et al., 1980). However, there is no evidence that the rafted \nsediments at Clava were frozen during their emplacement, most of the evidence \nindicating conversely that the sediments were wet with hydrofracturing and water-\nescape also occurring within the FTF. \n \n11. Conclusions \nThe shelly glaciomarine and related sediments exposed at Clava, NE Scotland occur \nin a series of thrust-bound rafts which were accreted next to a bedrock high on the SE \nside of the valley of the River Nairn. These sediments are thought to have originally \nformed a coarsening upwards sequence deposited by a delta or subaqueous fan which \nprograded into the Loch Ness marine basin. The distance between the site of \ndeposition of the Clava Shelly Formation within the Great Glen, to the site of \naccretion of the allochthonous rafts at Clava yields a minimum estimate of tectonic \ntransport of c. 50 km. The geometry of the rafted sediments at Clava, coupled with the \nassociated thrusting and large-scale folding of these bodies, are typical of many \n 24\nglacially-transported rafts described in the literature. At Clava, however, there is no \nevidence that the ice-rafted sediments were frozen at any time during their history of \nentrainment, transport and final accretion\/deposition. Rather, both macro- and \nmicroscopic evidence indicates that liquefaction, hydrofracturing and water-escape \noccurred repeatedly during deformation. This evidence, coupled with the presence of \nwater-lubricated, large-scale detachments within the sequence, has led to the \ndevelopment of a purely glacitectonic model for rafting at Clava. This model consists \nof an early phase of folding and thrusting in response initial shortening and overriding \nof the sediment pile by ice issuing from the Great Glen. This was followed by several \nphases of liquefaction and water-escape. Liquefaction appears to have been \naccompanied by continued movement along the thrusts. These thrusts and \u2018high strain \nzone\u2019s acted as a focus for water-escape with the repeated injection of fluidised \nsediment along these structures lubricating these d\u00e9collement surfaces and aiding \ntransport of the rafts.  \n \n12.
