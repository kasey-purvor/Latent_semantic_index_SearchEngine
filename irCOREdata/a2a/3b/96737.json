Here we outline the essential ideas that lead us to the subject of this\npaper.\nWhen burns are extensive, conventional skin grafts are not adequate to provide\nwound coverage and other procedures must be used. A current method to\nassist with skin repair in burn patients is to use cultured epithelial autografts\nEmail addresses: p.voges@qut.edu.au (Paula K. Denman),\ns.mcelwain@qut.edu.au (D. L. Sean McElwain),\njohn.norbury@lincoln.oxford.ac.uk (John Norbury).\nPreprint submitted to Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 2 November 2006\n(CEA) (Green et al. (1979), O\u2019Connor et al. (1981), Gallico et al. (1984) and\nDeLuca et al. (1989)). This technique involves taking epidermal cells from an\nunburnt area of the patient\u2019s body and then expanding the skin cells in culture\nby plating the cells onto a feeder layer of growth-arrested 3T3 cells (a mouse\nfibroblast cell line). This allows for optimal epidermal cell growth. An epithelial\nsheet is formed and then grafted onto the patient\u2019s burn to provide permanent\ncoverage (O\u2019Connor et al., 1981). This procedure has several disadvantages. It\nmay take 3-4 weeks for the graft to be available (Green, 1991). In addition, the\ncell sheets are hard to handle as they are very fragile (Harris et al. (1998) and\nWilliamson et al. (1995)). Thirdly, the production of CEA is labor intensive\nand the process of growing the sheets of cells is expensive (Fraulin et al.,\n1998). Chalumeau et al. (1999) estimated that the cost of this treatment was\napproximately US$80 000 for children and US$110 000 for adults.\nA novel way of delivering epidermal cells is to use a spray apparatus. The\npaper by Wood (2003) discusses the cultured epithelial autograft suspension\nthat is sprayed onto a wound, CellSprayr, that is manufactured by Clinical\nCell Culture Ltd in Bentley, Western Australia. Wood has found that cells in\nsuspension are ready for clinical use in as short as five days and, as mentioned\nabove, are a lot easier to handle and administer than CEA in sheet form.\nFigure 1 shows the results of experiments carried out at Queensland University\nof Technology (QUT) where cells have been sprayed onto a prepared surface.\nThe cells have been cultured for 2 hours.\nFig. 1. The distribution of sprayed cells that have been cultured for two hours, from\nexperiments carried out at QUT. This picture is kindly provided by Damien Harkin,\nun-published data. The bar shown has a distance of 100\u00b5m.\nThe model developed previously to simulate the growth of colonies sprayed\n2\nonto the skin consists of a system of partial differential equations (PDE\u2019s) that\nassume the evolution of the cell density can be represented by an extension of\nthe Fisher equation to allow for (a) the keratinocyte cells undergoing a phe-\nnotype change to become quiescent and (b) contact inhibition of proliferation.\nThe governing equations are\n\u2202u1\n\u2202t\n= D1\u22072u1 + k1u1(u0 \u2212 u1 \u2212 u2 \u2212 u3 \u2212 q)\u2212 \u03bb1u1,\n\u2202u2\n\u2202t\n= D2\u22072u2 + k2u2(u0 \u2212 u1 \u2212 u2 \u2212 u3 \u2212 q)\u2212 \u03bb2u2 + \u03bb1u1,\n\u2202u3\n\u2202t\n= D3\u22072u3 + k3u3(u0 \u2212 u1 \u2212 u2 \u2212 u3 \u2212 q)\u2212 \u03bb3u3 + \u03bb2u2,\n\u2202q\n\u2202t\n= \u03bb3u3,\nwhere Di is the random motility (diffusion) coefficient, ki relates to the rate\nof proliferation and \u03bbi is the rate of conversion (i = 1, 2, 3). The maximum\ndensity is u0 and space can be occupied by u1, u2, u3 or q cells. When cells are\nsprayed on, it is possible that the cell density is not at its maximum. However,\nfor the purpose of this paper, we assume that the initial clumps are at their\nmaximum density. Here Di, ki and \u03bbi are taken to be constants.\nThere are four different clonal types: highly active, moderately active, least\nactive and quiescent cells. We denote the density of the highly active cells by\nu1 (cells per unit area), the density of the moderately active cells by u2, the\ndensity of the least active cells by u3 and quiescent cell density by q.\nThe equation for the quiescent cell density has a simple form. We are assuming\nthat the quiescent cells do not undergo random motility (migration) and do\nnot proliferate. It can be seen that cell proliferation is assumed to cease when\neither the space is fully occupied or the cells have become quiescent. There is\na transition from a highly active cell to a moderately active cell and then a\nmoderately active cell to a least active cell. The least active cell then becomes\nquiescent. The reverse transitions are not possible (Barrandon, 1993).\nFull details are available in Voges et al. (2006).\nWhile the original modelling is in two dimensions (the burn space) and involves\ndifferent clonal types, here we investigate a novel model in one dimension and\ninvolving only one active species. The governing equations are\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= D\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+ ku(u0 \u2212 u\u2212 q)\u2212 \u03bbu, (1)\n\u2202q\n\u2202t\n= \u03bbu, (2)\nwhere u(x, t) represents the active cell density and q(x, t) represents the quies-\n3\ncent cell density with x representing distance and t representing time. Here D\nis the random motility of the cells, k is a measure of the proliferative capacity\nof the cells, u0 is the maximum cell density and \u03bb characterises the rate at\nwhich active cells become quiescent. The initial and boundary conditions are\ndiscussed later.\nSherratt (2000) has argued that models of competing close-packed cell popula-\ntions should include contact inhibition of migration. Here we have followed the\napproach adopted by Pettet et al. (1996b) and Gaffney et al. (1999) in that we\nhave not included contact inhibition in the random motility terms. Numerical\nresults obtained when Equation (4) below is solved with the term \u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2\nreplaced\nby \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\n(1\u2212 u\u2212 q)\u2202u\n\u2202x\n)\nare very similar and here we adopt the simpler form for\nthe random motility. This paper is concerned with cell invasion into an empty\nwound space. If the wound space is occupied by cells of either type then the\nmodel could be revised to include contact inhibition explicitly.\nIn this system, the active cells stop proliferating locally if u+ q = u0, that is,\nif the region is fully occupied by active and\/or quiescent cells.\nIn the first part of this paper, we nondimensionalise the equations and present\nthe numerical results for different parameter values showing normal and im-\npaired healing. The numerical solution of the PDE\u2019s exhibits travelling wave\nbehaviour. In Section 4 we apply travelling wave analysis to obtain a con-\nstraint on the wave speed and numerically solve the travelling wave equations.\nSection 5 examines four overlapping regions of the solution depending on the\ndominate terms in the equations to obtain a better understanding of the so-\nlution. Section 6 uses an approximation to the travelling wave equations to\nobtain an approximate solution for q(x, t). This approximate solution is used\nto obtain a closed form approximate solution. An estimate for the maximum\nactive cell density and the final skin cell density are also obtained. These ap-\nproximations predict the cell densities to about 1% accuracy for all values of\nthe model parameter \u03b1 > 1. All the tables are located in the Appendix.\n2 Nondimensionalisation\nBefore displaying numerical solutions and carrying out the mathematical anal-\nysis we nondimensionalise the system. It should be noted that it is possible to\nwrite the first equation in the form\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= D\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+ ku(u0 \u2212 \u03bb\nk\n\u2212 u\u2212 q), (3)\nalthough we retain the form (1) for our analysis.\n4\nThere are various ways to carry out the nondimensionalisation. Here we scale\nthe cell densities by the maximum density, u0, and adopt a timescale that\nis associated with the rate at which active cells become quiescent. We then\nobtain\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n=\n\u22022u\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03b1u(1\u2212 u\u2212 q)\u2212 u, (4)\n\u2202q\n\u2202t\n= u, (5)\nwhere u\u2217 = u\nu0\n, q\u2217 = q\nu0\n, t\u2217 = \u03bbt , x\u2217 = x\nL\nwith L2 = D\n\u03bb\nand \u03b1 = ku0\n\u03bb\n. The\nasterisks have been dropped for notational convenience. The distance scale,\nL, represents the distance that the active cells can migrate, assuming random\nmotility in the characteristic time t\u2217. Note that we require \u03b1 > 1 for net\ngrowth.\nWe model the ingrowth between two colonies that have been sprayed onto the\nwound, as shown in Figure 2. We assume that there are no cells in the wound\ninitially so that u(x, 0) = q(x, 0) = 0 inside the burn where \u2212l2 < x < 0,\nl2 positive, and u(x, 0) = 1 and q(x, 0) = 0 for a sprayed cell colony where\n0 < x < l1. We assume that the left end of the domain is the burn centre\nso that we impose a no flux condition there, namely \u2202u\n\u2202x\n= 0 at x = \u2212l2. We\nassume that the centre of the colony is at x = l1 where we also have a no flux\ncondition so that \u2202u\n\u2202x\n= 0 at x = l1.\n-l\n2 l10\nt = 0 u\nx\nFig. 2. A schematic diagram of the wound area at t = 0. Here \u2212l2 is the centre of\nthe burn and l1 is the centre of the active cell colony.\n3 Numerical Solutions\nEquations (4) and (5) are solved using the method of lines and a finite dif-\nferences spatial discretisation, as implemented by the NAG Fortran Library\nroutine D03PCF.\n5\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of the active cell density represented by u(x, t)\n(blue dot-dash line), the quiescent cell density represented by q(x, t) (red dot-\nted line) and the total cell density (u + q, solid black line) as a function of\nx at equally spaced time for the scaled maximum proliferation rates \u03b1 = 2\nand \u03b1 = 10. Active cells migrate into the wound space and proliferate to start\nto close the wound. These active cells become quiescent and the wound space\nbehind the pulse of active cells is filled with quiescent cells. The region of\ncells is then occupied by proliferating and\/or quiescent cells (solid black line).\nFor certain \u03b1 values, the cells never completely close the wound, for example\n\u03b1 = 2 as shown in Figure 3(a). Proliferation has stopped and the cells become\nquiescent, so the wound does not completely fill.\nIt is interesting to note the similarity of these solutions with those discussed in\nPettet et al. (1996a) which models the wound-healing process in soft tissue. In\nthat model, the capillary tips display a chemotactic response to the presence\nof a chemoattractant. The tip profile is very like the active cell distribution in\nthe model being discussed here.\n(a) (b)\n\u2212100 \u221280 \u221260 \u221240 \u221220 0\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nx\nu\n, \nq,\n u\n+q\n\u2212100 \u221280 \u221260 \u221240 \u221220 0\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nx\nu\n, \nq,\n u\n+q\nFig. 3. Typical numerical solutions for u(x, t), q(x, t) and u(x, t)+ q(x, t) plotted as\na function of x at equally spaced times t. The solution for the active species (blue\ndot-dash line) appears to evolve to a pulse while the solutions for the quiescent cells\n(red dotted line) and u+ q (solid black line) resemble a travelling wave, all moving\nwith constant shape and speed from right to left. (a) Here \u03b1 = 2. Every tenth\ndimensionless time step up to 50 is shown. From the numerical solutions where the\nwave forms, the maximum of u is about 0.1489 and q tends to approximately 0.8003.\n(b) Here \u03b1 = 10. Every fourth dimensionless time step up to 16 is shown. From the\nnumerical solutions where the wave forms, the maximum of u is about 0.6547 and\nq tends to 1.0027, approximately.\nIn our model we observe that as \u03b1 increases, the maximum density of the\nactive cells (maximum u) increases. Another observation is that, as expected,\nthe time to healing is shorter (i.e. healing occurs faster) as \u03b1 increases.\n6\n3.1 Impaired Healing\nFigure 4 shows an example with \u03b1 = 0.9 which leads to impaired healing.\nSince \u03b1 < 1, the net growth of active cells is negative (the transformation to\nquiescence exceeds the proliferative growth).\n(a) (b)\n\u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0 5 10\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nx\nce\nll \nde\nns\nity\n\u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0 5 10\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nx\nce\nll \nde\nns\nity\nFig. 4.

(b) The distribution of quiescent cells as a function of time.\n3.2 Time for the Wound to Heal\nChoosing different values of the maximum scaled proliferation rate, \u03b1, we\ncan estimate the time it takes for the wound to heal. We assume that the\nwound is \u201chealed\u201d when the centre of the wound has a cell density of 80%\nof the maximum possible cell density. We choose the centre of the wound to\nbe \u2212l2 = \u2212100. Figure 5 shows a plot of the time to healing against the\nmaximum scaled proliferation rate, \u03b1 (black solid line). As expected, when\nthe maximum scaled proliferation rate is small, the wound takes a long time\nto heal and when the maximum scaled proliferation rate is large, the wound\nheals more quickly.\nThe time to healing can be determined approximately by the distance the wave\nhas travelled divided by the speed of the travelling wave. The scaled distance\nof the wound considered is 100 dimensionless units and the dimensionless\nspeed is shown in Section 4 to be approximately 2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2212 1. Therefore, a good\napproximation to the healing time is T|l2| =\n|l2|\n2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u22121 + tc where tc is the time it\ntakes to set up the travelling wave. The equation T100 =\n50\u221a\n\u03b1\u22121 +1 is shown to\nbe a good approximation (red dotted line) in Figure 5.\n7\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\u03b1\nH\nea\nle\nd \nTi\nm\ne\nFig. 5.

The\napproximation T100 =\n50\u221a\n\u03b1\u22121 + 1 is shown as a red dotted line.\n3.3 Limiting Value of the Scaled Quiescent Cell Density\nThe limiting value of the scaled quiescent cell density (q), which we denote by\nN , is determined by the time evolution of the quiescent cells. Column one of\nTable A.2 shows the numerical values of N for different \u03b1 values. The value\nof q is the most useful quantity for cell biologists since it corresponds to the\nhealed cell densities.\n4 Travelling Wave Analysis\nThe numerical results suggest that the system may, under certain conditions,\nhave travelling wave solutions. We seek a wave of cells moving into the wound\nwith constant shape and speed.\nLetting z = x+ at, we write u(x, t) = U(z) and q(x, t) = Q(z) where a is the\nwave speed. Here a is positive since we are considering waves moving to the\nleft. Substituting the solution forms into the system of equations (4) and (5)\ngives\naU \u2032 = U \u2032\u2032 + \u03b1U(1\u2212 U \u2212Q)\u2212 U, (6)\naQ\u2032 = U, (7)\nwith U(\u2212\u221e) = U(\u221e) = Q(\u2212\u221e) = 0. Here a prime denotes differentiation\nwith respect to z. Recall that \u03b1 = ku0\/\u03bb and that we assume \u03b1 > 1 to obtain\ntravelling waves.\n8\nWe let S = U \u2032 to obtain the system\nS \u2032 = aS \u2212 \u03b1U(1\u2212 U \u2212Q) + U, (8)\nU \u2032 = S, (9)\nQ\u2032 =\n1\na\nU. (10)\nThere are two steady states, the wounded state (S,U,Q) = (0, 0, 0) and the\nhealed state (0, 0, N), where N is arbitrary, and these satisfy the given initial\nconditions.\nWe examine the behaviour of the system near the steady states by linearising\nabout the steady states and finding their stability. Set s1 = S, u1 = U and\nq1 = Q\u2212 Q\u00af, where Q\u00af = 0 far in front of the wave and Q\u00af = N far behind the\nwave.\nThe linearised equations are\ns\u20321 = as1 \u2212 \u03b1u1(1\u2212 Q\u00af) + u1, (11)\nu\u20321 = s1, (12)\nq\u20321 =\n1\na\nu1. (13)\nThese equations can be integrated by substituting s1 = u\n\u2032\n1 and u1 = aq\n\u2032\n1 from\nequations (12) and (13) into equation (11) respectively, for instance, to obtain\ns\u20321 = au\n\u2032\n1 \u2212 \u03b1aq\u20321(1\u2212 Q\u00af) + aq\u20321.\nThis can be integrated with respect to z to obtain the equation\ns1 = au1 \u2212 \u03b1aq1(1\u2212 Q\u00af) + aq1 + c, (14)\nwhere c is a constant of integration. Far in front and far behind the wave,\nu1 = q1 = s1 = 0, and therefore c = 0.\nSubstituting expression (14) into equation (12) gives the two linear equations\nu\u20321 = au1 \u2212 \u03b1aq1(1\u2212 Q\u00af) + aq1, (15)\nq\u20321 =\n1\na\nu1. (16)\nThe eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the linearised system (15) and (16) are\ngiven by\n\u00b5 =\na\n2\n\u00b1 1\n2\n\u221a\na2 \u2212 4(\u03b1(1\u2212 Q\u00af)\u2212 1).\n9\nFor the wounded steady state (U\u00af , Q\u00af) = (0, 0) the eigenvalues are\n\u00b5 =\na\n2\n\u00b1 1\n2\n\u221a\na2 \u2212 4(\u03b1\u2212 1).\nWe are assuming that \u03b1 > 1, therefore, the critical point (0, 0) can be classified\nas:\n\u2022 an unstable node when a > 2\u221a\u03b1\u2212 1 (two positive unequal eigenvalues),\n\u2022 an unstable node when a = 2\u221a\u03b1\u2212 1 (one positive repeated eigenvalue), or\n\u2022 an unstable spiral when a < 2\u221a\u03b1\u2212 1 (a complex conjugate pair of eigen-\nvalues with positive real parts).\nWe require u and q to be non-negative to be biologically realistic and therefore\na spiral solution is not relevant. This gives us a constraint on the speed in front\nof the wave, namely,\na \u2265 amin = 2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2212 1. (17)\nThe dimensional form of the wave speed is amin = 2\n\u221a\nD(ku0 \u2212 \u03bb). For the\ndimensioned Fisher equation (equations (1) and (2) with \u03bb = 0, so that q = 0),\nthe minimum wave speed is 2\n\u221a\nDku0 which is an equivalent result. Thus, the\npresence of a term that models the transition to quiescence, \u03bb, slows down the\nspeed of the wave.\nTo find the approximate scaled wave speed numerically, we follow the tech-\nnique used in Maini et al. (2004), and the results are shown in Figures 6 and 7.\nWe find the wave speed at the positions u = 0.5, u = 0.1 and u = 0.01. At each\ntime ti, the position of xi where u takes a particular value (u = 0.5, u = 0.1\nand u = 0.01) is obtained using linear interpolation between the computed u\nvalues. The wave speed is estimated using xi+1\u2212xi\nti+1\u2212ti .\nAs time increases, the wave speed is eventually faster than the minimum wave\nspeed, amin = 2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2212 1. Over time the estimates of the wave speed at each of\nthe u positions (u = 0.5, u = 0.1 and u = 0.01) converge to the same value, if\nwe have a true travelling wave (unaffected by boundary conditions, etcetera).\nThis behaviour is seen for all \u03b1 values under the condition that the active cell\ndensity, u, does in fact reach 0.5.\nFor the unwounded steady state (U\u00af , Q\u00af) = (0, N), the eigenvalues are\n\u00b5 =\na\n2\n\u00b1 1\n2\n\u221a\na2 \u2212 4(\u03b1(1\u2212N)\u2212 1)).\nThe critical point (0, N) can be classified as:\n\u2022 an unstable node when a2 > 4(\u03b1(1\u2212N)\u2212 1) with N < 1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n(two positive\n10\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n5.5\n5.55\n5.6\n5.65\n5.7\n5.75\n5.8\n5.85\n5.9\n5.95\n6\ntime\nw\na\nve\n s\npe\ned\nu = 0.5\nu = 0.1\nu = 0.01\n2\u221a(\u03b1\u22121)\nFig. 6.

When N > 1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\nthen a2 > 4(\u03b1(1\u2212 N)\u2212 1) is always satisfied. Therefore, a constraint is that\nN > 1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n.\n11\n4.1 Numerical Solutions of the Travelling Wave Equations\nWe want to solve\nS \u2032 = aS \u2212 \u03b1U(1\u2212 U \u2212Q) + U, (18)\nU \u2032 = S, (19)\nQ\u2032 =\n1\na\nU, (20)\nnumerically using a shooting method to compare these travelling wave forms\nwith the solutions of the original equations.\nIn order to determine the behaviour of this system near the steady state\n(S,U,Q) = (0, 0, N) we assume a power series for Q near the steady state,\nbut retain only terms of second degree, in the form Q(Z) = N \u2212CaZ +CbZ2\nwhere Z = e\u00b5z, Ca and Cb are constants and Re(\u00b5) < 0 because z \u2192\u221e.\nRecalling that U = aQ\u2032, our expression for U is\nU = a(\u2212\u00b5CaZ + 2\u00b5CbZ2).\nSubstituting our expressions for U and Q into equation (6) and taking the first\npower in Z, we obtain, as expected, \u00b5 = 0 or \u00b5 = a\n2\n\u00b1 1\n2\n\u221a\na2 \u2212 4(\u03b1(1\u2212N)\u2212 1).\nThe second power in Z results in the relationship\n4a\u00b52Cb = 8Cb\u00b5\n3 \u2212 \u03b1a\u00b52C2a \u2212 \u03b1\u00b5C2a + 2\u03b1\u00b5Cb(1\u2212\n1\n\u03b1\n\u2212N),\nwhich can be rearranged to obtain\nCb =\n\u2212C2a\u03b1(a\u00b5+ 1)\n2(2\u00b5(a\u2212 2\u00b5)\u2212 \u03b1(1\u2212N) + 1) .\nHaving found an expression for Cb in terms of Ca, we can use\nQ = N \u2212 Cae\u00b5z \u2212 C\n2\na\u03b1(a\u00b5 + 1)\n2(2\u00b5(a\u2212 2\u00b5)\u2212 \u03b1(1\u2212N) + 1)e\n2\u00b5z, (21)\nU = a\n(\n\u2212Ca\u00b5e\u00b5z \u2212 C\n2\na\u03b1(a\u00b5+ 1)\n(2\u00b5(a\u2212 2\u00b5)\u2212 \u03b1(1\u2212N) + 1)\u00b5e\n2\u00b5z\n)\n, (22)\nand\nS = a\n(\n\u2212Ca\u00b52e\u00b5z \u2212 2 C\n2\na\u03b1(a\u00b5+ 1)\n(2\u00b5(a\u2212 2\u00b5)\u2212 \u03b1(1\u2212N) + 1)\u00b5\n2e2\u00b5z\n)\n, (23)\nas initial values when shooting from right to left.\n12\nWe numerically solve the system of equations (18), (19) and (20) from z = 20\nto z = \u221220 where the initial conditions are given by equations (21), (22) and\n(23). We choose \u00b5 = a\n2\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u221a\na2 \u2212 4(\u03b1(1\u2212N)\u2212 1) and Ca = 0.5. Since this\napproximation is only used for z \u2192\u221e, we choose the negative \u00b5 as we require\nZ = e\u00b5z to decay as z \u2192\u221e. Here Ca is an arbitrarily chosen positive constant.\nThe value of Ca varies the position of the wave, but has no effect on the shape\nof U and Q. Our initial starting position, z = 20 is arbitrarily chosen with the\nconstraints that z is positive (since we chose negative \u00b5) and Z = e\u00b5z is small.\nChanging the value of z, keeping it positive, not too large and not too small,\ndoes not change the value of N nor the shape of U and Q, just the position\nof the wave.\nChoosing the minimum wave speed (17) and the value of N that allows U and\nQ to approach zero as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e, we solve the system of equations (18), (19)\nand (20) for different \u03b1 values. Figure 8 shows the numerical solutions of these\nequations for \u03b1 = 2, 6 and 10. In each of the figures, the blue dotted line is\nthe solution for S, the green dot-dash line is the solution for U and the solid\nred line is the solution for Q.\nTable A.1, shown in the Appendix, compares the maximum of U from the\ntravelling wave solutions with the maximum of U from the PDE numerics\nfor different \u03b1. For \u03b1 \u2265 10 we need to specify N to over 10 decimal place\naccuracy to shoot successfully. The decimal place accuracy required increases\nas \u03b1 increases due to the exponentially small terms as \u03b1 gets larger. We give\nthe value of N to five decimal places since the numerical solutions are very\nsensitive to the solution values chosen for large z. When integrating, N has to\nbe precise otherwise the values of U and Q do not tend to zero as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nFor \u03b1 = 4 and \u03b1 = 8, the travelling wave solutions are compared to the\nsolutions to equations (4) and (5) in Figure 9.\nSince Q\u2032 = 1\na\nU , we observe that the integral of U from z = \u2212\u221e to z = \u221e is\nequal to aN , where N = Q(\u221e). This shows that, for each \u03b1, the values of a\nand N both affect the area under U and hence the shape and height of U .\nWe now want to look at the relationship between the parameter values a and\nN for a fixed \u03b1 in equations (18), (19) and (20). For \u03b1 = 2 and 10, we vary a\nand choose N such that U and Q approach zero as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. We use the same\ninitial z, Ca and \u00b5 values as above and the initial values given by equations\n(21), (22) and (23). The length of the domain is determined by the requirement\nthat both U and Q go to approximately zero within the domain. Figure 10(a)\nshows N versus a for \u03b1 = 2 and Figure 10(b) shows N versus a for \u03b1 = 10.\nIt can be seen that for a fixed \u03b1 value there exist solutions for different a and\nhence N .\n13\n(a) (b)\n\u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0 5 10 15 20\n\u22120.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nz\nS,\n U\n a\nnd\n Q\n\u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0 5 10 15 20\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nz\nS,\n U\n a\nnd\n Q\n(c)\n\u221220 \u221215 \u221210 \u22125 0 5 10 15 20\n\u22120.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nz\nS,\n U\n a\nnd\n Q\nFig. 8. The numerical solutions of the travelling wave equations. The travelling wave\nequations are solved on the interval \u221220 \u2264 z \u2264 20. The solution for S is shown in\nthe blue dotted line, U in the green dot-dash line and Q in the red solid line. (a)\nHere \u03b1 = 2, a = 2 and N = 0.80023894. The maximum of U is 0.1487. (b) Here\n\u03b1 = 6, a \u2248 4.472 and N = 1.00335. The maximum of U is 0.5209. (c) Here \u03b1 = 10,\na = 6 and N = 1.00264556. The maximum of U is 0.6551.\nFigures 11(a) and (b) show the solutions S, U and Q for \u03b1 = 2 and 10,\nrespectively, for different a values. The value of N is then determined such\nthat S, U and Q approach zero as z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Figure 11(a) shows the solutions\nwhen \u03b1 = 2 for a = 1 (black), 2 (red) and 4 (blue). Figure 11(b) shows the\nsolutions for \u03b1 = 10 and a = 2 (black), 6 (red) and 10 (blue). For a < amin,\nU becomes negative before going back to zero. This reinforces the argument\nabove that it is biologically unrealistic to have a < 2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2212 1. It can be seen\nfrom the figures that changing the value of a significantly changes the shape\nof both U and Q. The travelling wave solutions for U and Q have the same\nshape as the solutions to the PDE\u2019s when a = 2 for \u03b1 = 2 in Figure 11(a)\nand a = 6 for \u03b1 = 10 in Figure 11(b).

The boundary conditions are Q\u02d9, Q\u00a8 \u2192 0 as \u03b6 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and\nQ\u2192 0 as \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. We seek solutions of the form Q, Q\u02d9 > 0 for all \u03b6 since Q\nand U = Q\u02d9 are cell densities, and define N := Q(\u221e) = \u222b\u221e\u2212\u221e Q\u02d9(\u03b6)d\u03b6.\n16\nWe expect Q(\u03b6) to be as shown in Figures 12 and 13 where we have normalised\n\u03b6 = 0 to be at the maximum of Q\u02d9, that is, of U .

The solutions for Q (red solid line), Q\u02d9 (green dash-dot line), Q\u00a8 (blue dotted\nline) and 1\na2\n...\nQ = 1\na2\nU\u00a8 (blue solid line) for \u03b1 = 35 are shown. The solution Q is\ndivided into four regions, depending on the dominant terms in equation (26). Note\nthat Q\u00a8 goes up to nearly 8 (not shown).\nroot of equation (28) for a2 = 4(\u03b1\u2212 1) is\n\u00b5\u02c6 =\n1\n2\n(\na2 \u00b1\n\u221a\na4 \u2212 4a2(\u03b1\u2212 1)\n)\n=\na2\n2\n.\nFor a2 large, Aea\n2\u03b6\/2 changes significantly over a small length scale a\u22122 in \u03b6.\nThus the non-zero influence in Region (1) will get smaller as \u03b1 gets larger. In\nRegion (1) the solution of equation (27) is given by\nQ = Aea\n2\u03b6\/2 with Q\u02d9 = U =\na2\n2\nAea\n2\u03b6\/2 and Q\u00a8 =\na4\n4\nAea\n2\u03b6\/2. (29)\nNote that 2\na2\n...\nQ = Q\u00a8 = a\n2\n2\nQ\u02d9 = a\n4\n4\nAea\n2\u03b6\/2 which shows that all the terms in\nequation (27) are necessary. Also note that Q\u02d9\nQ\n\u2192 a2\n2\nas \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e which will be\nused later.\n5.2 Approximate Solution in Region (2)\nSince the behaviour shown in (29) forces Q\u02d9 to become O(1) before Q does, we\ncan no longer neglect the Q\u02d9 term and we hence require Region (2). We drop\n18\nthe term involving Q in equation (26) to obtain\n1\na2\n...\nQ \u2212 Q\u00a8+ \u03b1Q\u02d9(1\u2212 Q\u02d9)\u2212 Q\u02d9 = 0.\nWriting X = Q\u02d9, Y = Q\u00a8 we obtain\nX\u02d9 = Y, (30)\n1\na2\nY\u02d9 = Y \u2212 \u03b1X(1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n\u2212X). (31)\nX \u2019 = Y                                  \nY \u2019 = a2 (Y \u2212 alpha X (1 \u2212 X \u2212 1\/alpha))\nalpha = 10\na = 6\n \n \n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\nX\nY\nFig. 14. The (X,Y ) phase plane for \u03b1 = 10 and a = 6.\nThe (X,Y ) phase plane system, shown in Figure 14 for \u03b1 = 10, has the critical\npoints (X,Y ) = (0, 0) and (X,Y ) = (1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n, 0). We seek an orbit (X(\u03b6), Y (\u03b6))\nleaving the node at (0, 0) and travelling to the saddle at (1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n, 0). Note that\nwhen equations (30) and (31) are solved in linearised form near X = Y = 0 as\n\u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, i.e. as (X,Y ) = (Q\u02d9, Q\u00a8)\u2192 (0, 0), we obtain (a2\n2\n, a\n4\n4\n)Aea\n2\u03b6\/2 \u2192 (0, 0).\nBy integrating X we see that X\nQ\n\u2261 Q\u02d9\nQ\n= a\n2\n2\nas \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e, which agrees with\nRegion (1) smoothly.\nBy looking at the signs of each term in equation (24), we see that at the\nmaximum of U , we have U positive, U\u02d9 = 0 and U\u00a8 negative, which forces\nU + Q < 1. This also holds in the neighbourhood and to the left of this\npoint. Using U + Q < 1, in Region (2) we require Qmax to remain less than\n1 \u2212 Xmax = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 1\u03b1) = 1\u03b1 as U = X \u2192 Xmax = 1 \u2212 1\u03b1 . Note that in\nRegion (2), Q(\u03b6) =\n\u222b \u03b6\n\u2212\u221eX(\u03b6)d\u03b6 increases without bound as we move towards\n(X,Y ) = (1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n, 0) in the (X,Y ) phase plane. Since Q should remain less than\n19\n1\n\u03b1\nin Region (2), the region must finish before U \u2192 1 \u2212 1\n\u03b1\nand we move into\nRegion (3).\nRegion (2), as shown in Figures 12, 13 and 14, has both Q\u00a8 and\n...\nQ no longer\ngrowing unboundedly as \u03b6 increases, and then Q\u02d9 is drawn towards 1 \u2212 1\n\u03b1\nas...\nQ\u2192 0.\n5.3 Approximate Solution in Region (3)\nIn Region (3) we have Q, Q\u02d9 bounded and order 1, and 1\na2\n...\nQ small for a2 large,\nsince\n...\nQ is bounded, so the model equation is\nQ\u00a8 = \u03b1Q\u02d9(1\u2212Q\u2212 Q\u02d9)\u2212 Q\u02d9. (32)\nWe write Q\u00a8 = Q\u02d9dQ\u02d9\ndQ\n, so for Q\u02d9 6= 0 we have\ndQ\u02d9\ndQ\n= \u03b1(1\u2212Q\u2212 Q\u02d9)\u2212 1.\nThen\nQ\u02d9 = 1\u2212Q\u2212 Ce\u2212\u03b1Q, (33)\nfor constant C.\nFor \u03b6 increasing we want a solution with Q\u02d9\u2192 0, so that Q\u2192 1 to this order of\napproximation (since \u03b1 large means e\u2212\u03b1Q is extremely small, for all constant\nC). Further, for a constant B,\nQ = 1 +Be\u2212\u03b6 + . . . ,\nas \u03b6 \u2192\u221e. We need to use Region (4) to find N = Q(\u221e) more accurately.\nOn the other hand, when we consider \u03b6 decreasing, Q becomes small (note\nQ(\u03b6) is monotonic since Q\u02d9 = U > 0). Initially it appears that we could\naccurately, to leading order, let Q \u2192 0 and Q\u02d9 \u2192 0 as \u03b6 decreases to \u2212\u221e, so\nthat C = 1. However, this is not asymptotically correct. For \u03b1\u001d 1, if we take\nC = 1 in the Region (3) solution, we have (Q, Q\u02d9)\u2192 (0, 0) as \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e in our\nsolution, so apparently we do not need Region (2), but if we check 1\na2\n...\nQ we find\nit is the same size asymptotically (but not numerically) as the biggest terms\nin equation (32). Further as Q\u2192 0 we have Q\u02d9 = \u2212Q+ \u03b1Q+ O(Q2), so that\nQ = Ae(\u03b1\u22121)\u03b6 = Aea\n2\u03b6\/4, which contradicts the actual Region (1) behaviour,\nwhich is Aea\n2\u03b6\/2, as \u03b6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Hence, Region (2) is necessary. But the choice\nC = 1 turns out to be useful, as we see in Section 6.\n20\nWe now wish to find the maximum of Q\u02d9, which occurs at Q = Q\u2217, by consid-\nering d\ndQ\n(1\u2212Q\u2212Ce\u2212\u03b1Q) = \u22121+\u03b1Ce\u03b1Q\u2217 = 0. Then Q\u02d9max = Umax = 1\u2212Q\u2217\u2212 1\u03b1\nfor Q\u2217 = C ln\u03b1\u03b1 . By examining the computed values of the maximum of u from\nthe PDE\u2019s (4) and (5), we find that when C = 1.1, the approximation Umax is\naccurate to about 1% for 6 . \u03b1 \u2264 100. This is illustrated in Table A.1 in the\nAppendix.\nHence we obtain\nUmax \u2261 Q\u02d9max = 1\u2212 1.1 ln\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n, (34)\nwhere we have taken C = 1.1. This is a good approximation for the maximum\nof U for large \u03b1.\nThus, for \u03b6 decreasing, Region (3) ends when Q = O( ln\u03b1\n\u03b1\n) (and U = Umax),\nand we then move into Region (2). To this order we have Q\u2217 = C ln\u03b1\u03b1 small,\nso that Q\u02d9max = 1 \u2212 C ln\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 1\u03b1 is near 1 \u2212 1\u03b1 which gets us \u201cnear\u201d the saddle\npoint shown in Figure 14, where (X,Y ) = (Q\u02d9, Q\u00a8) = (1 \u2212 1\n\u03b1\n, 0), for \u03b1 large.\nThis gives us the correct overlap to match Regions (2) and (3).\n5.4 Approximate Solution in Region (4)\nWe finally consider the limit \u03b6 \u2192\u221e in equation (26), where not only Q\u02d9\u2192 0\nbut Q\u2192 N . In Region (4) our model equation is\n1\na2\n...\nQ \u2212 Q\u00a8+ \u03b1Q\u02d9(1\u2212N)\u2212 Q\u02d9 = 0. (35)\nWe want a solution Q\u02d9 = \u2212Be\u2212\u00b5\u00af\u03b6 , where B is a constant, with Re(\u00b5\u00af) > 0, so\nthat\n1\na2\n\u00b5\u00af2 + \u00b5\u00af+ \u03b1(1\u2212N)\u2212 1 = 0. (36)\nChoosing the positive root of (36) since \u03b6 is positive, we obtain\n\u00b5\u00af =\n1\n2\n(\n\u2212a2 +\n\u221a\na4 \u2212 4a2\u03b1(1\u2212N) + 4a2\n)\n.\nFrom Region (3) we have Q = 1 + Be\u2212\u03b6 + . . . as \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e, so that to leading\norder for large \u03b1 we have \u00b5\u00af = 1 (by matching Be\u2212\u03b6). We define lim\u03b6\u2192\u221eQ(\u03b6) =\nN = N0 + N\u00af where N0 = 1 from matching with Region (3), and N\u00af \u2192 0 as\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e. Then \u03b1(1 \u2212 N) must be asymptotically smaller than 1 so that to\nleading order \u00b5\u00af = 1\n2\n(\u2212a2 +\u221aa4 + 4a2) (using a2 \u001d a2\u03b1(1\u2212N)). Next we use\nthe Binomial Theorem to expand the term\n\u221a\na4 + 4a2 = a2+2+ . . . for a\u001d 1.\nThus \u00b5\u00af = 1\n2\n(\u2212a2+a2+2+ . . .) = 1+ . . . holds, and we can match onto Region\n(3) only provided 1\u2212N \u001c 1\n\u03b1\n, i.e. N = 1 + o( 1\n\u03b1\n).\n21\nWe can find the limiting value N more accurately by substituting Q = 1 +\nN\u00af +Be\u2212\u03b6 into equation (26) to obtain\n\u2212B\na2\ne\u2212\u03b6 \u2212Be\u2212\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b1Be\u2212\u03b6(Be\u2212\u03b6 \u2212 N\u00af \u2212 Be\u2212\u03b6) +Be\u2212\u03b6 = 0,\nresulting in N\u00af \u2248 1\n\u03b1a2\n. Hence,\nN = 1 + N\u00af \u2248 1 + 1\n\u03b1a2\n.\n5.5 The Results from Matching These Regions\nSo far we have Region (2) lifting the orbit from Region (1) towards the point\nQ\u02d9max = 1 \u2212 C ln\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 1\u03b1 at Q\u2217 = C ln\u03b1\u03b1 so that we can match onto Region (3).\nIn Region (3) we can smoothly match onto Region (4) when N = 1 + 1\n\u03b1a2\nfor\n\u03b1\u001d 1.\nNote that Region (2) is very narrow for large a, as we can see from Figures\n12 and 13, which implies that the active cells reach their maximum density\nvery quickly, almost before there is any change in the quiescent cell density.\nThen in Region (3), Q\u02d9 decays more slowly while Q increases as the active cells\nchange into healed tissue.\n6 An Approximation to the Travelling Wave Equations\nThe rescaling \u03b6 = z\na\nof the travelling wave equations, resulting in equations\n(24) and (25), allows us to neglect the term 1\na2\nU\u00a8 if a is large, to obtain an\napproximation to the travelling wave equations, namely,\nU\u02d9 = \u03b1U(1\u2212 U \u2212Q)\u2212 U, (37)\nQ\u02d9 = U, (38)\nwhere U = U(\u03b6) and Q = Q(\u03b6). We now examine this model for \u03b1 > 1 and\na2 = 4(\u03b1\u2212 1), even though a2 is no longer necessarily large.\nThis system is the same as previously discussed in 5.3 which has the solution\nU = 1\u2212Q+ C2e\u2212\u03b1Q,\nwhere C2 is a constant.\nWe now have an approximation for U in terms of Q over the whole domain\nfor a large, which is U +Q = 1 for Q\u001d 1\n\u03b1\n. See Figure 15 for the importance\n22\nof this limit curve U + Q = 1 which is an envelope for the family of solution\ncurves as \u03b1\u2192\u221e.\nWe know that far in front of the wave, U = Q = 0 which will give us the\ncondition on C2, namely, C2 = \u22121. This ensures that the trajectory starts at\nthe origin in this phase plane. Then\nU(\u03b6) =\ndQ\nd\u03b6\n= 1\u2212Q\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q, (39)\nand\nU(z) = a\ndQ\ndz\n= 1\u2212Q\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q, (40)\nhold in the (U,Q) phase plane with either \u03b6 or z as the parameter.\nFigure 15 shows this phase plane and several trajectories using (39) where\n\u03b1 = 50, 10, 6 and 2. For \u03b1 \u2264 1, the phase portrait has no trajectory for\npositive U .\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nU\nQ\nU+Q =1\nFig. 15.

For \u03b1Q close to zero, a Maclaurin expansion for e\u2212\u03b1Q for \u03b1Q\nsmall can be used to get an approximation.\nThe solution to Q\u02d9 = 1\u2212Q is Q = 1\u2212 C3e\u2212\u03b6 where C3 is a constant. Setting\nan arbitrary value for Q(\u03b6 = 0), Q0, our solution then becomes Q = 1\u2212 (1\u2212\nQ0)e\n\u2212\u03b6 .\nWe obtain an approximate equation using a Maclaurin expansion for \u03b1Q small,\nonly retaining quadratic terms, namely\nQ\u02d9 = (\u03b1\u2212 1)Q\u2212 1\n2\nQ2\u03b12.\n24\nSolving this first order differential equation results in\nQ =\n2(\u03b1\u2212 1)\n\u03b12 + 2C4(\u03b1\u2212 1)e\u2212(\u03b1\u22121)\u03b6\n, (41)\nwhere C4 is the constant of integration.\nAgain, taking Q(0) = Q0, we obtain C4 =\n2\nQ0\n(\u03b1\u22121)\u2212\u03b12\n2(\u03b1\u22121) . We require C4 to be\npositive since if C4 < 0, the solution is unbounded for finite \u03b6. For C4 to be\npositive, we require Q0 <\n2(\u03b1\u22121)\n\u03b12\n.\nSubstituting the expression for C4 into the expression for Q, we obtain\nQ =\n2(\u03b1\u2212 1)\n\u03b12 + ( 2\nQ0\n(\u03b1\u2212 1)\u2212 \u03b12)e\u2212(\u03b1\u22121)\u03b6 .

As can be seen from\nthese figures, this approximation to the maximum value of u is very close to\nthat obtained numerically.\nTable A.1 shows that for \u03b1 & 6 the approximation equation (34) with C = 1.1\nactually is better for larger \u03b1 than that of equation (45) where C = 1.

It can be seen that the\napproximation Umax = 1\u2212 ln\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 1\u03b1 is better for \u03b1 . 6 while the other approximation\nis better for \u03b1 & 6.

(b)\nThis figure shows the approximation for 1.1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 100.\n6.3 Maximum Slope of Q\nWe can find an approximation for the slope of Q with the knowledge that the\nslope = dQ\ndz\n= 1\na\nU . The maximum slope of Q is therefore the maximum of U\ndivided by a. Using the approximations (45) and (17), the maximum slope of\nQ is\nQMaxSlope \u2248 \u03b1\u2212 ln\u03b1\u2212 1\n2\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2212 1 .\nA plot of the maximum slope versus \u03b1 is shown in Figure 19 and this is com-\npared with the numerical maximum slope obtained from the PDE\u2019s. It can be\nseen that the slope increases until \u03b1 is approximately 5.5 and then decreases.\nThis is in contrast to Murray (2002) who investigated the corresponding slope\nfor the Fisher equation and determined that the wave front becomes less steep\nas the wave moves faster. In our model this is only true for \u03b1 greater than\napproximately 5.5 (\ndQMaxSlope\nd\u03b1\n= 5.4861). The switch in choice of optimal C,\nfrom C = 1 to C = 1.1 occurs at about the same value \u03b1 \u2248 6.\n6.4 Approximate Upper Bound for Q\nFrom the approximation (39) we can derive approximate values forQ(\u221e) = N .\nAs z \u2192 \u221e far behind the wave, U \u2192 0 and from (39), N \u2192 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1N . Note\nthat for \u03b1 very large, e\u2212\u03b1N \u2248 0 and therefore N \u2192 1.\n27\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n\u03b1\nM\nax\nim\num\n S\nlo\npe\nFig. 19. A graph of the maximum slope of Q versus \u03b1. The maximum slope deter-\nmined from the PDE\u2019s at x = \u2212100 (red dotted line) is compared to the approxi-\nmate maximum slope \u03b1\u2212ln\u03b1\u22121\n2\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u22121 (black solid line). The approximation is reasonably\naccurate.\nTable A.2 in the Appendix shows, for different \u03b1 values, a comparison between\nthe numerical value of N far behind the wave and the approximations of N\nobtained from solving 1\u2212N \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1N = 0. These values are consistent with the\nconstraint N > 1\u2212 1\n\u03b1\n. Figure 20 shows these results graphically. It can be seen\nfrom the numerical results that N values are above unity for \u03b1 large.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n\u03b1\nM\nax\nim\num\n o\nf Q\nFig. 20.

In Section 5 we\nused the transformation \u03b6 = z\na\non the travelling wave equations (6) and (7) to\n28\nobtain equations (24) and (25). Substituting equation (7) into (6) we obtain\nQ\u00a8(\u03b6) = \u000f\n...\nQ(\u03b6) + \u03b1Q\u02d9(\u03b6)(1\u2212 Q\u02d9(\u03b6)\u2212Q(\u03b6))\u2212 Q\u02d9(\u03b6), (46)\nwhere \u000f = 1\na2\n\u001c 1. For \u03b1 < 2, \u000f > 1\n4\nwhich means the approximation is less\naccurate due to \u000f being quite large.\nApplying perturbation techniques, we substitute\nQ = Q0 + \u000fQ1 + \u000f\n2Q2 +O(\u000f\n3),\ninto equation (46).\nAt zeroth order we obtain\nQ\u00a80 = \u03b1Q\u02d90(1\u2212 Q\u02d90 \u2212Q0)\u2212 Q\u02d90.\nThis is equivalent to solving the system of equations (37) and (38) which\nresults in the first order differential equation Q\u02d90 = 1\u2212Q0 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q0 which can\nnot be solved analytically for \u03b6.\nAt first order we obtain\nQ\u00a81 =\n...\nQ0 + \u03b1Q\u02d90(\u2212Q\u02d91 \u2212Q1) + \u03b1Q\u02d91(1\u2212 Q\u02d90 \u2212Q0)\u2212 Q\u02d91.\nSince we are interested in the solution as z \u2192 \u221e, we allow Q\u02d91, Q\u00a81 \u2192 0.\nWe hence obtain Q1 in terms of Q0, namely Q1 =\n...\nQ0\n\u03b1Q\u02d90\nas z \u2192 \u221e. Using\nQ\u02d90 = 1\u2212Q0\u2212e\u2212\u03b1Q0 we obtain\n...\nQ0 = Q\u02d90(1\u22122\u03b1e\u2212\u03b1Q0\u2212\u03b12Q\u02d90e\u2212\u03b1Q0+\u03b12e\u22122\u03b1Q0).\nAs z \u2192\u221e we allow Q\u02d90 \u2192 0 and hence e\u2212\u03b1Q0 = 1\u2212Q0. Therefore, Q1 =\n...\nQ0\n\u03b1Q\u02d90\n=\n1\n\u03b1\n(1\u2212 \u03b1(1\u2212Q0))2 where Q0 is the solution to Q0 = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q0.\nRecall that Q = Q0 + \u000fQ1 +O(\u000f\n2). Replacing a2 = 4(\u03b1\u2212 1), we can conclude\nthat\nN = Q(\u221e) \u2248 Q0 + (1\u2212 \u03b1(1\u2212Q0))\n2\n4(\u03b1\u2212 1)\u03b1 , (47)\nwhere Q0 is the solution to Q0 = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q0.\nThe solution to equation (47) for different \u03b1 values is shown in Table A.2 in\nthe Appendix. It can be seen that the approximation is very accurate for \u03b1\nlarge but not as accurate for small \u03b1. The approximationN = 1\u2212e\u2212\u03b1N is more\naccurate for \u03b1 . 6 and then the approximation N = Q(\u221e) \u2248 Q0+ (1\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212Q0))\n2\n4(\u03b1\u22121)\u03b1\nwhere Q0 is the solution to Q0 = 1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q0, is more accurate for \u03b1 & 6.\n29\n7 Conclusion\nWe have investigated the dynamics of a simplified model of the growth pat-\ntern of cells that are sprayed onto a burn to facilitate the healing process. In\nthis model there are two species, one of which migrates into the burn space,\nproliferates and undergoes a transition to a quiescent cell type that neither\nmigrates nor proliferates. The proliferation of the active cells is modulated by\ncontact inhibition.\nThe numerical solution of the governing partial differential equations reveals\nthat the invading pulse of active cells and the resulting wave of quiescent\ncells appears to show a travelling wave structure. The stable invading wave\nof healing cells travels at the slowest possible speed a = 2\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2212 1 in terms of\nthe parameter \u03b1 = ku0\/\u03bb. A linear stability analysis about the steady states\ngives a lower bound on the wave speed in terms of the dimensionless maximum\nproliferation rate of the active cells, \u03b1. A further investigation of the travelling\nwave equations leads to an approximate solution, Q\u02d9 = 1\u2212Q\u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q, which in\nturn leads to estimates of the maximum nondimensional active cell density as\nwell as the final nondimensional cell density within the burn. The maximum\nactive cell density approximation, Umax = 1\u2212 1.1 ln\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 1\u03b1 , is best for \u03b1 & 6 and\nthe approximation, Umax = 1\u2212 ln\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 1\u03b1 , is best for 1 < \u03b1 . 6.\nSeveral approaches are used to obtain improvements to the estimate of the\nfinal cell density using perturbation techniques. These are compared with the\nresults obtained from the numerical solution of the original partial differential\nequations and the approximations are good for large \u03b1; for \u03b1 & 6 we have\naccuracy to better than the third decimal place using N = Q(\u221e) \u2248 Q0 +\n(1\u2212\u03b1(1\u2212Q0))2\n4(\u03b1\u22121)\u03b1 where Q0 is the solution to Q0 = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1Q0. For \u03b1 . 6 we find\nN to 1% accuracy by using N = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b1N . The dimensional quantities are\nobtained by multiplying Umax and N by u0.\nThe switch value of approximately \u03b1 = 6 arises from the maximum of the\ngraph of the active cell density U divided by the wave speed a (which amounts\nto the maximum of the quiescent cell density) plotted against \u03b1, as given in\nFigure 19.\nIn this paper we investigated a problem related to the healing of wounds from\nburns. From our model analysis we derived a set of travelling wave equations\nwhich yielded an interesting mathematical analysis.\n30\n8 Acknowledgements\nThe authors thank Dr Graeme Pettet for helpful conversations and Beth\nAddison-Smith for assistance in computing programming.
