We\nalso utilize this expression to compare the theoretical through-\nput performance of MIMO and DMIMO systems and show\nthat DMIMO systems can achieve a throughput gain over their\nMIMO counterparts by taking advantage of spatial diversity.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCalculation of the channel capacity for multiple-input multiple-\noutput (MIMO) systems over Rayleigh fading channel has\nattracted considerable research interests in the past decades\n[1\u20133]. Recently, it has been shown by various authors using\ndifferent methods that the mutual information, also known as\ninstantaneous capacity, of the MIMO Rayleigh fading chan-\nnel is equivalent to a Gaussian random variable (RV) [4\u20137].\nThis result has been theoretically obtained for a large number\nof inputs and outputs of the MIMO channel and has been con-\nfirmed by simulations for even a small number of them [5,6].\nMoreover, this result has been used in [7] to approximate the\noutage probability of MIMO systems.\nIn distributed MIMO (DMIMO) systems, several static\nnodes equipped with several antennas cooperate to commu-\nnicate with a mobile node. This can be performed in a multi-\nhop fashion where one of the static node communicates with\nthe mobile node using other static nodes to relay the informa-\ntion [8]. Alternatively, it can be achieved in a distributed man-\nner where each static node shares the same data via a back-\nhaul link and all the static nodes communicate together with\nthe mobile node [9]. The latter scenario is considered here.\nThis work has been performed in the framework of the FP7 project\nROCKET IST-215282 STP, which is funded by the European Community.\nIn this paper, we propose a closed-form approximation of\nthe outage probability for the downlink and uplink of DMIMO\nsystems, relying on the system model introduced in Section 2.\nApplying a similar approach as in [4, 7] based on the replica\nmethod [10] and the multiple saddle point integration tech-\nnique [11], it can be shown that the instantaneous capacity\nof DMIMO systems over Rayleigh fading channel is asymp-\ntotically equivalent to a Gaussian RV [12]. In the MIMO\ncase [4, 7], the mean and variance of the equivalent Gaussian\nRV are given in terms of the roots of a degree-2 polynomial,\nand the uniqueness of the outage probability approximation\ndepends on the uniqueness of these moments, which itself is\nrelated to the selection of one root amongst the two possible\nroots of the degree-2 polynomial. This selection is straight-\nforward in the MIMO case. Similarly, the uniqueness of our\nclosed-form approximation, which is proposed in Section 2,\ndepends on the selection of one root amongst m + 1 possible\nroots. However, in the DMIMO case, the choice of the root is\na complex problem by itself which is first solved in Section 3\nfor the case of m = 2, and it is then generalized for any other\nm values. In Section 4, we indicate that the accuracy of our\napproximation increases as the rate or the number of nodes\nand antennas of the system increases. Next, we utilize our\nexpression to show the throughput gain that DMIMO systems\ncan achieve over MIMO systems when an unlimited number\nof automatic retransmission requests (ARQs) is assumed. Fi-\nnally, conclusions are drawn in Section 5.\n2. DISTRIBUTED MIMO SYSTEM MODEL\nWe consider a DMIMO communication system composed of\nm + 1 nodes which are in different locations, where m base\nstations (BSs) equipped of p antennas cooperate to transmit\/\nreceive data to\/from a mobile station (MS) equipped with q\nantennas, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The matrices \u03a3i and Hi\ncharacterize the average path loss\/shadowing and the MIMO\nRayleigh fading channel, respectively, between the i-th BS\nand the MS, i \u2208 {1,m}. The equivalent channel model of\nthe system depicted in Fig. 1 is then defined as H\u02dc = \u03a3\u0003H,\nwhere \u03a3 = [\u03a3\u20201,\u03a3\n\u2020\n2, . . . ,\u03a3\n\u2020\nm]\n\u2020\n, H = [H\u20201,H\n\u2020\n2, . . . ,H\n\u2020\nm]\n\u2020\n,\n(.)\u2020 is the Hermitian transpose operator and \u0003 is the entry-\nwise product between any two matrices.

Distributed MIMO system model\nCNr\u00d7Nt , H \u2208 CNr\u00d7Nt and \u03a3 \u2208 RNr\u00d7Nt+ , with R+ =\n{x \u2208 R|x \u2265 0}. The total number of transmit and receive\nantennas of the DMIMO system is defined as Nt and Nr,\nrespectively. In the downlink case Nt = mp, Nr = q and\nn = p, whereas in the uplink case Nt = n = q and Nr = mp,\nwhere n is the number of transmit antenna per node. Accord-\ningly, the receive signal r \u2208 CNr\u00d71 can be expressed as\nr =\n\u221a\n\u0002\/nH\u02dcs + n, (1)\nwhere \u0002 is the average transmitted signal energy, s \u2208 CNt\u00d71 is\na normalized to unit-power transmitted signal and n \u2208 CNr\u00d71\nis a vector of independent zero-mean complex Gaussian noise\nentries with a double-sided variance of N0\/2.\nWe consider that H is a random matrix having zero-mean\nand variance of 0.5 independently and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) Gaussian entries. We also assume that once H has\nbeen chosen, it then remains fixed for the whole transmission.\nIn this case, the channel is non-ergodic and the outage proba-\nbility, i.e, the probability that the transmission rate R exceeds\nthe instantaneous capacity of the channel C(H\u02dc), is defined as\nPout \u0002 P\n(\nC(H\u02dc) < R\n)\n, (2)\nwhere\nC(H\u02dc) \u0002 \u03bb ln\n\u2223\u2223\u2223INr + \u03b3nH\u02dcH\u02dc\u2020\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (3)\n\u03b3\u0002\u0002\/N0, \u03b3 \u2208 R+, is the average signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR),\nINr is a Nr \u00d7Nr identity matrix, H\u02dc\u2020 indicates the Hermitian\ntranspose of H\u02dc, and \u03bb = 1 if the capacity is expressed in\nnats\/s\/Hz or \u03bb = 1ln(2) if the capacity is expressed in bits\/s\/Hz.\nRecently, it has been shown in [4\u20137] that the instantaneous\ncapacity C(H) of MIMO systems over Rayleigh fading chan-\nnel, i.e., for m = 1, tends to be a Gaussian RV as p and q\ngrows to infinity. Following a similar approach as the one de-\nscribed in [4,7] , we have shown in [12] that C(H\u02dc) is asymp-\ntotically equivalent to a Gaussian RV for large values of p, q\nand m > 1, with its mean and variance are given by\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03bcC(H\u02dc) = \u2212\u03bbn\n[\n(m\u03b1 + \u03b2) ln(\u03c9) + \u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\nln\n(\n\u03c5i\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)\n+\u03b2 ln\n(\nd0\n\u03b2\n)\n+ \u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n]\n,\n\u03c32\nC(H\u02dc)\n= \u2212\u03bb2 ln\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b1\n\u03b2\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)2)\n,\n(4)\nwhere \u03b1 \u0002 p\/n, \u03b2 \u0002 q\/n, \u03c9 \u0002 1\/\u221a\u03b3, \u03c5i \u0002 1\/\u03b3i, \u03b3i is the\npath loss of the i-th BS-MS link and d0 is one of the m + 1\nroots of the following polynomial\nPm(d) = (d\u03c9\u2212\u03b2)\nm\u220f\ni=1\n(d+\u03c9\u03c5i)+d\u03b1\nm\u2211\ni=1\nm\u220f\nk=1\nk \u0002=i\n(d+\u03c9\u03c5k) = 0.\n(5)\nConsequently, knowing that C(H\u02dc) is equivalent to a Gaussian\nRV and applying (4) in (2), the outage probability of DMIMO\nsystems can be well approximated by\nPout \u2248 Q\n(\n\u03bcC(H\u02dc) \u2212R\n\u03c3C(H\u02dc)\n)\n(6)\nfor large values of p, q and m > 1.\nIt can be noticed in (4) that both \u03bcC(H\u02dc) and \u03c32C(H\u02dc) depend\non the value of d0. The root d0 can be chosen amongst m+1\nroots of Pm(d), and hence the formula in (6) would provide\nan unique outage probability result only if the selection of d0\nis unique for any given m > 1. In the next section, we first\nprove the uniqueness of the selection of d0 and express d0 in\nfunction of the parameters \u03c9, \u03c5i, \u03b1, \u03b2 for m = 2 in Section\n3.1. We then extend this proof for the case of m \u2265 2 in\nSection 3.2.\n3. APPROPRIATE SELECTION OF THE ROOT d0\nThe selection of d0 is constrained by the fact that \u03bcC(H\u02dc) \u2208 R\nand \u03c32\nC(H\u02dc)\n> 0 in (4). These two constraints imply that\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03bcC(H\u02dc) \u2208 R \u21d4 ln\n(\nd0\n\u03b2\n)\n\u2208 R\u21d4 d0 \u2265 0,\n\u03c32\nC(H\u02dc)\n> 0 \u21d4 0 <\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\nd0\n\u03c5i\u03c9 + d0\n)2\n\u2264 q\np\n.\n(7)\nUsing d0 \u2265 0 in the second constraint of (7), we obtain after\nsome simplifications that [13]\nmin\ni\n{\n\u03c9\u03c5i\n\u221a\nq\/(mp)\n1\u2212\u221aq\/(mp)\n}\n\u2265d0\u2265 0\u21d2\nm\u2211\ni=1\n(\nd0\nd0 + \u03c9\u03c5i\n)2\n\u2264 q\np\n.\n(8)\n530\nThus, the roots d0 must be appropriately chosen amongst the\nm + 1 root of Pm(d) to fulfill the constraints set in (7) and\n(8).\n3.1. DMIMO systems with two BSs\nIn the case of m = 2, the polynomial Pm(d) in (5) can be\nsimplified as P2(d) = c3d3 + c2d2 + c1d + c0, where the\ncoefficients c0, c1, c2, c3 are given by{\nc1= \u03c9[\u03c92\u03c51\u03c52 + (\u03c51+\u03c52)(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)], c0= \u2212\u03b2\u03c92\u03c51\u03c52,\nc2= \u03c92(\u03c51 + \u03c52) + 2\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2, c3= \u03c9.\n(9)\nNote that \u03c9 \u2208 R+, since \u03b3 \u2208 R+ and that \u03c5i \u2208 R+, since\nfor any i \u2208 {1,m} \u03b3i \u2208 R+. Furthermore, we consider that\np, q, n \u2265 1 and hence \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Q\u2217+, with Q\u2217+ =\n{\na\nb | a \u2208 N,\nb \u2208 N, a, b \n= 0}, since \u03b1 \u0002 p\/n and \u03b2 \u0002 q\/n. In other\nwords, we have \u03c9, \u03c5i \u2265 0, and \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0. The roots of P2(d)\nare then obtained by solving the cubic equation P2(d) = 0\nand its discriminant is usually expressed in terms of the coef-\nficients c0, c1, c2, c3 as follows [14]\n\u0394 =\n(\n3c1c3 \u2212 c22\n9c23\n)3\n+\n(\n9c1c2c3 \u2212 27c0c23 \u2212 2c32\n54c33\n)2\n.\n(10)\nInserting the values of c0, c1, c2, c3 in (10) and after intricate\ncomputations, it can be shown that \u0394 \u2264 0 in (10) for any\n\u03c9, \u03c51, \u03c52 \u2265 0, and \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 [13]. In this case, all the roots of\nP2(d) are real and can be expressed after some simplifications\nas follows [14]\ndk = \u2212 13c3\n[\n\u03b6k\n\u221a\nc22 \u2212 3c1c3 + c2\n]\n, (11)\nwhere \u03b60 = \u22122 cos( \u03b83 ), \u03b61 = 2 cos(\u03c0+\u03b83 ), \u03b62 = 2 cos(\u03c0\u2212\u03b83 ),\nk \u2208 {0, 2}, \u03b8 \u0002 acos\n(\n9c1c2c3\u221227c0c23\u22122c32\n2(c22\u22123c1c3)\n3\n2\n)\n, \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], and\nacos : [\u22121, 1] \u000b\u2192 [0, \u03c0] is the inverse cosine function. Using\na proof by contradiction, we first show that the root d0 in (11)\nis a real nonnegative root for any \u03c9, \u03c51, \u03c52 \u2265 0, and \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0.\nLet us assume that d0 < 0, it then implies with the definition\nof d0 in (11) that\n2 cos\n(\n\u03b8\n3\n)\u221a\nc22 \u2212 3c1c3 \u2212 c2\n3c3\n< 0.

(13)\nKnowing that c2\n2\n\u221a\nc22\u22123c1c3\n\u2208 [\u22121, 1], we apply the function\nacos to both sides of the inequality in (13), and this inequality\nsimplifies as\nacos\n(\n9c1c2c3 \u2212 27c0c23 \u2212 2c32\n2(c22 \u2212 3c1c3)\n3\n2\n)\n>3 acos\n(\nc2\n2\n\u221a\nc22 \u2212 3c1c3\n)\n.\n(14)\nNotice that the relation in (13) is reversed in (14) because the\nfunction acos is a monotonically decreasing function. Next,\nwe apply the function cosine, which is a monotonically de-\ncreasing function over [0, \u03c0], to both sides of the inequality in\n(14) and re-expressed (14) as\n9c1c2c3 \u2212 27c0c23 \u2212 2c32\n2(c22 \u2212 3c1c3)\n3\n2\n<\nc2\n2\n\u221a\nc22 \u2212 3c1c3\n(\nc22\nc22 \u2212 3c1c3\n\u22123\n)\n,\n(15)\nknowing that cos(3 acos(x)) = x(4x2 \u2212 3). Further deriva-\ntion steps lead to\n9c1c2c3 \u2212 27c0c23 \u2212 2c32 < c32 \u2212 3(c32 \u2212 3c1c2c3),\n\u221227c0c23 < 0.\n(16)\nUsing the definition of c0, c3 in (9), the proof can be summa-\nrized as d0 < 0 \u21d4 27\u03b2\u03c94\u03c51\u03c52 < 0. However, we know that\n\u03c9, \u03c51, \u03c52 \u2265 0 and \u03b2 > 0, hence 27\u03b2\u03c94\u03c51\u03c52 \u2265 0, which con-\ntradicts the result of the proof, and consequently d0 is a real\nnonnegative root, i.e., d0 \u2208 R+. Moreover, using a similar\napproach for d1 by assuming that d1 > 0 with(\n\u22122 cos\n(\n\u03b8 + \u03c0\n3\n)\u221a\nc22 \u2212 3c1c3 \u2212 c2\n)\n\/(3c3) > 0. (17)\nas a starting point, we obtain after some simplifications that\n(17) is equivalent to \u221227c0c23 < 0, i.e., 27\u03b2\u03c94\u03c51\u03c52 < 0 [13].\nThus, the result of the proof contradicts the aforementioned\nassumption and, hence, d1 \u2264 0. Finally, the parameters \u03b6k in\n(11) can clearly be ordered as follows \u03b60 \u2264 \u03b61 \u2264 \u03b62, since\n\u03b60 \u2208 [\u22122,\u22121], \u03b61 \u2208 [\u22121, 1] and \u03b62 \u2208 [1, 2]. This ordering\nstraightforwardly indicates that d2 \u2264 d1 \u2264 0 \u2264 d0.\nTherefore, P2(d) = 0 has only one real nonnegative solu-\ntion, which is denoted d0 and is expressed in terms of \u03c9, \u03c51,\n\u03c52, \u03b1 and \u03b2 as follows\nd0 =\n1\n3\u03c9\n[\n2 cos\n(\n\u03b8\n3\n)[\n\u03c94(\u03c521 \u2212 \u03c51\u03c52 + \u03c522) + \u03c92(\u03c51 + \u03c52)\n\u00d7(\u03b1 + \u03b2) + (2\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)2] 12 \u2212 \u03c92(\u03c51 + \u03c52)\u2212 (2\u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)],\n(18)\nwhere \u03b8 is given at the bottom of the page. Note that d0 in\n(18) is the only root of P2(d) that fulfils the constraints set in\n(7) and (8).

On the other\nhand, the coefficients c2 and c1 in (9) are modified as c\u20322 =\nc2 + (m \u2212 2)\u03b1 and c\u20321 = c1 + w(m \u2212 2)\u03b1.

Theoretical throughput comparison of a MIMO sys-\ntem against a two-BSs DMIMO system.\n4. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND APPLICATIONS\nFOR POUT\nOur closed-form approximation in (6) can be used to evaluate\nand compare the outage probability of DMIMO systems faster\nthan time consuming Monte-Carlo simulations. However, the\naccuracy of this approximation depends on the values of m, p\nand q. In Fig. 2, we establish numerically for a DMIMO sys-\ntem with two BSs, i.e., m = 2, the values of p and q for which\nour closed-form approximation in (6) has a sufficient accu-\nracy. We define \u03b3TH and \u03b3MC as the theoretical SNR and\nthe SNR obtained via Monte-Carlo simulation, respectively,\nwhich are required to achieve a certain rate R for a given out-\nage probability Pout. The absolute difference in dB between\nthese two SNRs, i.e., \u03b5\u03b3(dB) \u0002 |\u03b3TH (dB)\u2212\u03b3MC (dB)|, pro-\nvides a reliable measure of the accuracy of (6). The results\nin Fig. 2 has been obtained using 1 \u00d7 106 channel realiza-\ntions for the Monte-Carlo simulation. Concerning the two-\nBSs DMIMO system, we introduce \u0394\u03b3(dB) \u0002 \u03b32(dB) \u2212\n\u03b31(dB) as the SNR offset between the two BSs resulting from\nunequal path losses and shadowing between each BS and the\nMS. In order to evaluate (6) for m = 2, we use d0 in (18).\nIn Fig. 2, \u03b5\u03b3(dB) is plotted against the number of trans-\nmit antennas p, using a two-BSs DMIMO system, for Pout =\n1\u00d710\u22122, \u03b2 = 1, i.e., q = p, various rates R, several values of\n\u0394\u03b3(dB), and the downlink case. The results confirm that the\ninstantaneous capacity C(H) becomes more equivalent to a\nGaussian RV as the values of p grows larger, since \u03b5\u03b3(dB) de-\ncreases with p. Thus, the accuracy of our closed-form approx-\nimation in (6) increases in this case. The result also indicates\nthat the accuracy of (6) decreases when |\u0394\u03b3 |(dB) increases.\nMoreover, we observe that for \u03b2 = 1 and p \u2265 4, (6) provides\na sufficient accuracy for any rate, i.e., \u03b5\u03b3(dB)< 0.2 dB. No-\n532\ntice that similar results have been obtained for the uplink case.\nFinally, (6) being an approximation and not a bound, the theo-\nretical and Monte-carlo curves can criss-cross and this explain\nthe fluctuations of \u03b5\u03b3(dB) for low p values.\nAssuming an unlimited number of ARQs, the theoretical\nthroughput of communication systems can be expressed as\nT = (1 \u2212 Pout)R. Using (6) to evaluate Pout, we plot in Fig.\n3 the difference \u0394T between the theoretical throughput of a\nMIMO system and a two-BSs DMIMO system in function of\nthe rate R and of the SNR \u03b31(dB), for p = q = 4, \u03b3 = 1,\nand the downlink case. Moreover as indicated in the top right\ncorner of Fig. 3, we fixed \u03b32 = 1 for the DMIMO system\nand we considered an aggregate SNR \u03b31 + 1 for the MIMO\nsystem, in order to fairly compare the two systems for the\nsame total power. Results in Fig. 3 show that a throughput\ngain resulting from spatial diversity can be achieved by using\na DMIMO system instead of a MIMO system. In Fig. 3, a\nmaximum gain of 1.8 bits\/s\/Hz is reached for \u03b31 = 0 dB and\na rate of R \r 4.3 bits\/s\/Hz.\n5. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a closed-form approximation of the outage prob-\nability for DMIMO systems has been derived for both down-\nlink and uplink cases. It is shown that the instantaneous ca-\npacity of DMIMO systems over Rayleigh fading channel is\nasymptotically equivalent to a Gaussian RV and the mean and\nvariance of the equivalent Gaussian RV are given in terms of\nthe roots of a degree-(m+1) polynomial. The uniqueness of\nour closed-form approximation is then related to the selection\nof one root amongst m + 1 possible roots. The uniqueness of\nthe root selection has been firstly proved for m = 2 and the\nexpression of the root itself has been provided for this case.\nThen, the proof has been extended for the case of m \u2265 2. Fur-\nthermore, the accuracy of our closed-form approximation has\nbeen assessed for different SNR settings, rates, and number of\nantennas. Results have indicated that the accuracy of our ap-\nproximation is sufficient for p = 4 when m = 2. Finally, our\nexpression has been utilized to show that DMIMO systems\ncan achieve higher throughput than MIMO systems by using\nspatial diversity. In the future, we will consider a less ide-\nalized base-station cooperative model by taking into account\nthe erroneous communications between the base stations as\nwell as the bandwidth loss due to such communications.\n6.
