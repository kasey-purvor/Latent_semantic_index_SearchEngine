G Wellman and J. R.

However, TBCs are susceptible\nto various life limiting issues associated with their operating environment including, erosion, corrosion,\noxidation, sintering and foreign object damage.\nThis is a review paper that examines various degradation and erosion mechanisms of thermal barrier\ncoatings, especially those produced by electron beam physical vapour deposition (EB PVD) . The results\nfrom a number of laboratory tests under various impact conditions are discussed before the different\nerosion and foreign object damage mechanisms are reviewed. The transitions between the various erosion\nmechanisms are discussed in terms of the D\/d ratio (contact area diameter \/ column diameter), a relatively\nnew concept that relates the impact size to the erosion mechanism. The effects of aging, dopent additions\nand CMAS on the life of TBCs is examined. It is shown that while aging increases the erosion rate of EB\nPVD TBCs, aging of plasma sprayed TBCs in fact lowers the erosion rate.

INTRODUCTION\nSince the concept of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), which can reduce the metal surface temperature of\ncooled turbine blades by up to 150\u00b0C, was introduced in gas turbines 40yrs ago there has been a\nsignificant and steady increase in turbine entry temperature (TET). This drive towards a higher TET is a\ndirect result of the drive towards more fuel efficient engines. The efficiency (\u03b5) of a heat engine is given\nby the following equation [1]:\n2\n12\nT\nTT \uf02d\uf03d\uf065 (Equation 1)\nwhere, T2 is the operating temperature and T1 is the sink temperature.\nThus an increase in T2 (TET) results in an increase in efficiency of the engine. TBCs are essentially\nmultilayered coating structures that consist of a bondcoat that is applied to the substrate, a thermally\ngrown oxide (TGO) and a ceramic topcoat, typically an yttria stabilized zirconia. The bond coat can be\napplied by either thermal spraying or by diffusion methods. The TGO is formed between the bond coat\nand the ceramic top coat, during the production of the coatings as a result of the oxidation of the bondcoat\nand continues to grow throughout the life of the coating. Currently there are two basic production routes\nthat are used for modern TBC systems; plasma spraying (PS) \u2013 in vacuum for the bond coat and air for the\ntop coat or electron beam (EB) physical vapour deposition (PVD). These two systems result in very\ndifferent microstructures and properties as illustrated in Figure 1.\nPlasma sprayed TBCs in the form of MgO stabilized zirconia were first used in burner cans in 1963 [2] by\nPratt and Whitney, however in the 1980\u2019s 7wt% yttria stabilized zirconia emerged as the industry standard\ntop coat [2]. By the late 1980s EB PVD techniques were being used to deposit the top coat onto rotating\nblades, which due to their columnar microstructure were more strain tolerant making them ideal for\noperating under high thermal cyclic conditions [2,3]. Currently both plasma sprayed and EB PVD TBCs\nare widely used on different components in modern gas turbine engines. Typically EB PVD TBCs are\nused on aerofoils in aero-engines, due to their higher strain tolerance in high temperature high cycle\napplications, while PS TBC are typically used for combustor cans in aero-engines and on turbine blades\nand combustor cans for land based gas turbines. The different components within a TBC system are:\nA bondcoat system: Bondcoats for TBCs include the established MCrAlY series of environmental\nprotection coatings, diffusion aluminides and most recently the gamma + gamma prime (\uf067+\uf067\u2019) platinum\ndiffused single crystal materials [22-25].\nThe thermally grown oxide (TGO): The mode and rate of growth of the thermally grown oxide is critical\nto the durability of the TBC system. Since the conception of TBC systems much work has been\nundertaken to understand how the alumina oxide grows, interacts, degrades and finally fails during high\ntemperature service, specifically as measured by the thermal cyclic life [26-31]. The multi-material\naspects of the TBC system complicate this understanding through diffusion, stress relaxation and chemical\ninteractions between the component parts\nAn outer ceramic top coat \u2013 The most prevalent material is ZrO2-(7-8)wt%Y2O3 (YSZ), although a\nnumber of alternative ceramics have also been considered. Newer materials having lower thermal\nconductivities include zirconia with multiple rare earth stabilizers [4-7] and pyrochlore phases, such as\ngadolinium zirconate [7]. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these alternative materials exhibit inferior\nerosion resistance and a greater susceptibility to delamination than the commercial standard 7YSZ [8,9].\nThus, the challenge in developing new oxide systems with enhanced overall performance is to understand\nthe dichotomy between improved thermal resistance and the ceramics reduced durability [8]. The issues\nof erosion and foreign object damage performance will be addressed in this paper.\n3(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 1: Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of various TBC microstructures, a) an EB PVD\nTBC, b) a PS TBC, c) a segmented (vertically cracked) TBC.\nThe SEM micrographs in Figure 1a-c show the various microstructural features of the different types of\nthermal barrier coatings. In Figure 1a one can see the typical columnar microstructure of the EB PVD\nceramic top coat, it is this columnar structure that gives this type of TBC its strain tolerance. In Figure 1b\none can see the typical \u2018splat\u2019 morphology of a PS TBC with the associated porosity, while in Figure 1c\nthe vertical cracks are clearly visible.\nDuring the early years of TBC use in gas turbine engines oxidation of the bond coat was typically\naccepted as the primary cause of failure, and has thus been extensively researched, specifically issues\nassociated with thermal cycling of the TBC [10-13]. Erosion of TBCs while acknowledged as a problem\n[14,15] has until recently been considered a secondary problem, however with the use of EB PVD TBCs\non turbine blades erosion has become more of an issue and has received more attention with numerous\npapers covering the topic of TBC erosion. Early work concentrated on the effect of variables like\nvelocity, impact angle and erodent properties [16-19], while more recent work has examined erosion\nmechanisms [20-22] and the effects of aging and dopent additions [23].\nHowever, as the ceramic top coat and the processing have developed the temperatures at which TBCs\nhave operated has increased significantly resulting in oxidation issues with the bond coat and more\nrecently, with the surface of the TBC reaching temperatures greater than 1240\u00b0C, CMAS attack. CMAS,\nor calcium magnesium alumina silicates, is a low melting point flux which can form deposits on the\nsurface of the TBC. When the surface temperature is greater than 1240\u00b0C, the CMAS melting\ntemperature [24], the CMAS will infiltrate the TBC resulting in extensive degradation of the columnar\nmicrostructure and \u2018locking\u2019 the tops of the columns together on cooling resulting in a loss of strain\ntolerance.\nThe schematic in Figure 2 illustrates the various degradation mechanisms that can occur to thermal barrier\ncoatings during service in gas turbine engines. During laboratory testing most of these issues are\ninvestigated independently, whereas in reality a number of these mechanisms are normally occurring\nsimultaneously. This paper briefly discusses various degradation mechanisms before briefly examining\nthe interactions between sintering, aging, dopent addition and CMAS on the erosion rates of TBCs.\nInitially perceived as being of secondary importance \u2013 when compared to bondcoat oxidation \u2013 for static\nparts, erosion and foreign object damage (FOD) become more significant for rotating hardware in\nadvanced gas turbine engines. Particularly, the recent observations that the erosion resistance of many of\nthe new lower thermal conductivity TBCs is worse than the commercial 7YSZ materials [9] and that\nduring service the erosion resistance of EB-PVD TBC coated parts can degrade by up to a factor of x4 due\nto ceramic sintering [20,23].\nTBC Columns\nTGO\nBC\nsubstrate\nTGO\nBC\nsubstrate\nVertical cracksPS splats\nTGO\nBC\nsubstrate\nPorosity\n4Figure 2: Schematic illustrating the types of damage that can occur to EB PVD TBCs in an engine\nenvironment.\nFor life-critical applications, erosion of the ceramic top coat is perceived as a potential problem, whether\nfor aero- [16,25-29] or industrial applications [25,30]. Thermal barrier coatings are more susceptible to\nerosion than fully dense ceramics [31] because the coating microstructures contain many crack-like\nfeatures.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON THE EROSION OF THERMAL BARRIER COATINGS\nStudies into the erosion performance of thermal barrier coatings are somewhat limited in the published\nliterature, with the majority of studies using either the Cincinatti wind tunnel rig, the Cranfield gas gun\nfacility, or industrial burner rig facilities. The capabilities of the two laboratory test facilities were\ncompared in a previous EPRI research workshop into corrosion in advanced power plants [32].\nExperimental studies are roughly evenly split between studies of plasma sprayed systems\n[14,16,17,19,20,31,33-37] and EB-PVD systems [16,18,19,26,30,33,38], although data on the latter, to a\nsignificant degree, have only recently become available. Both laboratories (Cincinnati and Cranfield)\nhave the ability to test at room temperature and elevated temperatures. Tests up to 815\uf0b0C and 910\uf0b0C have\nbeen undertaken in these test facilities respectively and the experiments undertaken in both facilities when\ntesting coatings to the same manufacturing specification, give similar results [17,31,35]. The difference\nbetween the two approaches is that Cincinatti use a combustion based system, burning fossil fuels, to\nproduce the hot gas stream; while Cranfield uses an electrically heated, high velocity gas gun [32].\nErosion\nForeign Object Damage\nTBC in Engine\nEnvironment\nCMAS\nOxidation\nCompaction\nDamage\nSintering\n60 \u00b5m\n20 \u00b5m\n10 \u00b5m\n20 \u00b5m\n40 \u00b5m\n15 \u00b5m\n5Comparing results from both of these laboratories, and incorporating the limited experimental data from\nother laboratories, permits a data set for the erosion of APS (air plasma sprayed) TBCs over the\ntemperature range room temperature - 1600\uf0b0C and EB-PVD coatings over the temperature range RT-\n910\uf0b0C to be established for particle velocities up to circa 300ms-1. Recently limited data on the erosion of\nsegmented, plasma sprayed TBCs is also available from recent tests [45].\nTrends from this dataset, together with current understanding of the mechanisms of failure under erosion\nand FOD are discussed in this paper.\nFirstly, Figure 3 presents a comparison of the erosion performance of an air plasma sprayed (APS) TBC,\nwith a lamellar microstructure resulting from the deposition of pancake like splat particles, to an EB-PVD\nTBC with the classic columnar microstructure. Tests on bulk zirconia are included as a reference. Bulk\nZrO2-8wt%Y2O3 when eroded with 100\u00b5m alumina particles gave erosion rates of 3.6 \uf0b1 0.1g\/kg at room\ntemperature (particle velocity was 140m\/s) and 12.5 \uf0b1 2.9 g\/kg at 910\u00baC (particle velocity was 230m\/s)\n[17,39]. Also included in Figure 3 are the more recent erosion studies undertaken on a segmented plasma\nsprayed microstructure (see Figure 1c).\nIt can be seen from Figure 3 that at room temperature (20\u00baC) and 910\u00baC, the columnar EB-PVD\nmicrostructure is more erosion resistant than the splat-like APS microstructure by a factor of\napproximately x10, under normal (90\u00ba) impact conditions. Erosion rates were respectively 20 g\/kg (20\u00baC,\n140m\/s) and 28.5 g\/kg (910\u00baC, 230m\/s) for the EB-PVD columnar microstructure compared to 210 g\/kg\n(20\u00baC, 140m\/s) and 322 g\/kg (910\u00baC, 230m\/s), for the splat-like APS microstructure. The vertically\nmicrocracked plasma sprayed TBC by comparison \u2013 although only tested at room temperature \u2013 exhibited\nerosion rates much closer to that expected for EB-PVD ceramic than APS ceramic, namely 24.4 g\/kg\n(20\u00baC, 140m\/s).\n3.6\n12.5\n210\n322\n24.4\n20\n28.5\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n20 C 910 C 20 C 910 C 20 C 910 C 20 C 910 C\nE\nro\nsi\no\nn\nra\nte\n[\ng\n\/k\ng\n]\nBulk Zirconia APS TBC Segmented EB-PVD TBC\nAPS TBC\nFigure 3: Comparison of the erosion performance of air plasma sprayed, EB-PVD and segmented plasma\nsprayed coatings at RT and 910\u00baC. Data for bulk ZrO2-7wt%Y2O3 ceramic is included as a reference\nAll coating morphologies are significantly less erosion resistant than the bulk ceramic (the EB-PVD\nceramic erodes at x 2 to x 5 the rate of bulk zirconia, depending on test temperature), confirming the\npremise that the crack-like features inherent in the design of successful thermal barriers must compromise\n6the erosion performance. The ability of the columnar boundaries in the EB-PVD ceramic microstructure\n(and the vertical microcracks in the segmented APS TBC) to limit crack propagation is thought to account\nfor its improved erosion resistance over the conventional air plasma sprayed microstructure.\nRecent room temperature erosion studies undertaken at Cranfield under the HIPERCOAT programme on\ngadolinia doped (2mole%), zirconia-4mole% (7wt%) yttria confirmed the anecdotal evidence that rare\nearth doped EB-PVD TBCs erode at a higher rate (less erosion resistant) than the industrial standard ZrO2-\n7wt% (4 mole%) Y2O3 material. The measured erosion rate using 90-125\u00b5m alumina, at 90\u00ba impact with\na particle velocity calculated to be 100-110m\/s was 29-34g\/kg, 2-3x that of the ZrO2-7wt%Y2O3 material,\nat 11-13g\/kg [40]. Clearly this dichotomy between improved thermal resistance and reduced damage\ntolerance must be addressed so that advanced ceramic systems with balanced properties and improved\noverall performance can be developed.\n2.1 Erosion Performance of Commercial EB-PVD Thermal Barrier Coatings Deposited onto\nAerofoil Components\nAt Cranfield repeat EB-PVD TBCs, of commercial manufacture, have been tested using 100\uf06dm alumina\nat 230ms-1 and 910\uf0b0C [31] or 140ms-1 at room temperature [17,39]. The aim of this series of tests was to\nevaluate the repeatability of erosion behaviour from sample to sample (using 25mm x 25mm test pieces)\nand by location around a coated blade (samples were cut from the suction surfaces, pressure surface and\nfrom the leading edge). The repeatability of the test pieces reflects the reproducibility of the coating\nprocess from one run to another, while the repeatability of samples taken from a blade reflects the\nreproducibility of manufacture around a blade profile.\nMeasured erosion rates on test pieces (TBC thickness 360\u00b5m), when tested at 90\u00ba impact and 910\u00baC using\n100\u00b5m alumina at a velocity of 230m\/s, varied between 14.0 and 28.5g\/kg with a mean of 19.8g\/kg. The\ndata, shown as solid diamond symbols in Figure 4, was found to fit a classical Weibull model (depicted in\nthe following equation), when plotted as erosion resistance (1\/erosion rate) where Fw is the Weibull\nprobability, E is the erosion rate, Eo is a minimum erosion rate under these test conditions and \uf062, \uf068 are\nconstants.\nThis is to be expected for fracture behaviour controlled by the size of inherent defects. The Weibull\nmodel was of the form:\n\uf0ef\n\uf0fe\n\uf0ef\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf062\n\uf068\no\nw\nEE\nF\n11\nexp1 (Equation 2)\nTransforming Equation 2 by taking double logarithms one obtains:\n\uf068\uf062\uf062 ln11ln))1ln(ln( \uf02d\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf02d\no\nw EE\nF (Equation 3)\n7Thus a plot of ))1ln(ln( wF\uf02d\uf02d vs ln (1\/E) allows the Weibull slope \u03b2 and the characteristic erosion rate \u03b7 \nto be evaluated.

Each segment tested was 25mm\nx 25mm area approximately with 10 segments taken around the blade profile (label SS1 to SS5 along the\nsuction surface, LE leading edge and PS1 to PS4 along the pressure surface). Six of these samples have\nbeen erosion tested at 90\u00ba impact at room temperature, using 100\u00b5m alumina at a velocity of 140m\/s.\nFigure 5 plots the result of this study, effectively mapping the erosion rate of the EB-PVD TBC around the\nblade profile. Erosion rates varied around the blade profile, from 13.9 g\/kg on the pressure surface (PS4)\nto 14.8 g\/kg on the leading edge (LE) and a maximum of 15.2g\/kg on the suction surface (SS1). This\ntrend maps out the degree of constraint around the blade, for on the suction surface the coating grows into\na more open space (convex surface), while on the pressure surface the space is constrained (a concave\nsurface). These growth constraints will modify the EB-PVD column size and the extent of intra-column\nporosity, thus influencing the erosion rate.\nWhilst discussing constraints introduced by blade geometries another factor that must be taken into\naccount is the likelihood of producing inclined column microstructures during the manufacture of EB-\nPVD TBC coated turbine parts. Areas prone to these non-ideal microstructures are the shrouds and\nplatforms of the high pressure turbine blades and the deposition into the intra-vane spacing for nozzle-\nguide vane pairs. Inclined columns on platforms and shrouds can be partially alleviated by applying a\nbutterfly action to the blade manipulators during TBC deposition. However, such remedial actions are not\npossible when considering the constraints offered by nozzle guide vane pairs. Here the column inclination\n815.2\n14.7\n15.1\n14.8\n14.0\n13.9\n13.0\n13.5\n14.0\n14.5\n15.0\n15.5\nSS1 SS3 SS5 LE PS2 PS4\nRepeat erosion tests\nE\nro\nsi\no\nn\nra\nte\n[g\n\/k\ng\n]\nis defined by the incident angle of the vapour flux and the available aperture between the pair of nozzle\nguide vanes.\nGood erosion resistance of EB-PVD thermal barrier coatings requires that the columnar microstructure is\nvertically aligned. Any off axis symmetry modifies the mode of column fracture and this has a significant\neffect on the erosion rate. Figure 6 illustrates the increase in erosion damage that can occur when the\nTBC growth direction is inclined. On impact, fracture may occur throughout the coating (rather than in the\nnear surface region as discussed in the next section for a vertically aligned EB-PVD TBC microstructure)\nwith some fracture at mid-column length and others near to the bond coat surface. This behaviour is\nbelieved to result from bending of the columns during impact, such that the largest defect in the column\nsurface causes fracture.\nFigure 5: Variation in erosion rate of a commercial EB-PVD TBC around a blade profile.\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nInclination of Columns (Degrees)\nE\nro\nsi\non\nR\nat\ne\n(g\n\/k\ng\n)\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n30 50 70 90 110\nInclination of Columns (Degrees)\nE\nro\nsi\no\nn\nR\nat\ne\n(g\n\/k\ng\n)\na) Column inclination 7\u00ba to 90\u00ba b) Enlargement of region 30\u00ba to 90\u00ba\nFigure 6: Influence of column inclination on the erosion rate of EB-PVD TBCs [21].\nClearly, the TBC microstructure, developed as part of the manufacturing process can have a major effect\non erosion behaviour. This effect of column inclination would be significant when coating such\ncomponents as nozzle guide vanes, which are often designed with multiple aerofoil parts. At shallow\n9angles of inclination <7.5\uf0b0, erosion rates in excess of 6,000 g\/kg are observed (see Figure 6). In fact, the\nEB-PVD TBC performs worse than an APS TBC when the columns are inclined at angles below 50\uf0b0. For\nacceptable performance it is recommended that off axis inclination be kept less than 15\u00ba (i.e. inclinations\nbetween 75-90\u00ba). This would give a doubling of the erosion rate.\n3.0 OBSERVED DAMAGE MECHANISMS IN THE EROSION AND FOREIGN OBJECT\nDAMAGE OF EB-PVD TBCS\nIt has been demonstrated in the previous section that EB-PVD TBCs are inherently more erosion resistant\nthan their air plasma sprayed counterpart. Factors between x7 and x10 have been reported depending on\nthe exact test conditions and ceramic microstructure developed in coating manufacture. This section\ndiscusses the material removal mechanisms and the role of microstructure.\nThe difference in erosion behaviour is associated with the differing modes of failure for an air plasma\nsprayed (APS) and EB-PVD coatings. The APS coating fails by the propagation of cracks along splat\nboundaries and through the microcrack network that are an inherent part of the microstructure and which\nprovide some degree of strain tolerance [31]. In contrast, the EB-PVD coating when impacted by\nparticles of 100\uf06dm or less forms parallel, near surface cracks within the columns [17,35,36]. Cracks stop\nat column boundaries, see Figure 7, and a number of neighbouring columns need to fracture before\nmaterial is lost.\n(a) Room Temperature (b) 800\u00baC\nFigure 7: SEM cross sections of eroded samples of EB PVD TBCs showing near surface cracking, a) at room\ntemperature and b) at 800\u00baC\nThe mechanism of foreign object damage (FOD) is more complicated and involves gross plastic damage\nand shear bands within the TBC [9,26,35,39] often leading to cracks down to the metal oxide interface and\nthus large scale ceramic removal (see Figure 10a)-c) later in this paper).\nIn the following sections, the different erosion and FOD mechanisms will be discussed and defined\naccording to the observed damage for the different impact conditions starting with low energy impacts.\nThe authors define erosion (Mode I) as the loss of material from the top 5-20\u00b5m of the coating through\nrepeated impact by small particles causing near surface cracking in individual columns. FOD (Mode III)\ninvolves gross plastic damage, the bending of columns and ultimately the propagation of shear bands\ndown to the ceramic bond coat interface. Between these two modes exists a transition mode which has\nbeen termed compaction damage (Mode II).\n10\nOne thing that has become clear during the study of the erosion of EB PVD TBC is that the particle size\nand velocity appear to be intrinsically linked when trying to ascertain the erosion regime of the TBC.\nPrevious work by Wellman and Nicholls [37] on erosion of EB PVD TBCs resulted in the development of\nan erosion map, shown in Figure 8, depicting the different erosion regimes that will be discussed in the\nfollowing sections. However, subsequent work has shown that the ratio between the contact footprint and\nthe column diameter is perhaps a better way to ascertain the erosion mechanism and this will be discussed\nin Section 3.4.\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10 100 1000\nParticle Diameter (\u00b5m)\nV\nel\no\nci\nty\n(m\n\/s\n)\nMode I zone r\/R = 1 r\/R = 0.6\nr\/R = 0.4 Mode III zone Mode III\nMode II zone Mode II Mode I\nElastic regime\nMode I Mode II Mode III\nFigure 8: Erosion map for EB PVD TBCs showing relationship between particle velocity, size and erosion\nregime [37].\n3.1 Mode I - Erosion (Near surface cracking\/lateral cracking)\nErosion is the standard term used by most authors in the literature to describe the progressive loss of\nmaterial from the surface of an EB PVD TBC while still maintaining the integrity of the columnar\nmicrostructure. This occurs under small particle impact conditions where the near surface region, the top\n20\u00b5m, of the individual columns are cracked due to impact. Material is lost when a number of\nneighbouring columns have been impacted and cracked. The cracks are observed to initiate at the\nelastic\/plastic interface that occurs under the impacting particles [20], this type of damage is illustrated in\nFigure 7.\nThe relevance of room temperature erosion testing has been questioned as to whether it is representative\nof high temperature erosion. As far as can be seen from Figure 7a and 7b the same mechanism of near\nsurface cracking occurs at both room and high temperatures. Although, it can be argued that the degree of\nplastic deformation that can be accommodated by the ceramic at elevated temperatures is greater than at\nroom temperature. However, analysis of samples eroded at both room temperature and high temperature\nshowed that there was no difference in the observed depth at which the near surface cracking occurred\nduring Mode I erosion of the samples.\nErosion rates are highly dependent on a number of material properties which include Young\u2019s Modulus,\nHardness and Fracture Toughness, all of which are affected by temperature. Thus, it can be argued that\n11\nalthough the erosion mechanism at room temperature and high temperature is nominally similar the\nerosion rates could well be different.\n3.2 Mode II - Compaction Damage\nThis is a relatively new observation and is essentially a transition mechanism that occurs between erosion\nand FOD. It involves the compaction of the columns without the cracking that occurs during erosion or\nthe gross deformation of the columns that occurs during FOD. This type of damage has been observed\nunder both room temperature and high temperature impact conditions, and is illustrated in Figure 9.\nFigure 9, a room temperature impact, illustrates the ability of EB PVD TBCs to deform plastically, even at\nroom temperature. Note however, that this type of plastic deformation, as in Mode I erosion, is most\nlikely in the form of the densification of the near surface individual columns. Penetration depths are\nexpected to be greater than under Mode I erosion with the higher impact energies involved in Mode II\ncompaction.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 9: SEM micrographs of single impact Mode II compaction damage showing compaction of the coating,\nnote the absence of cracking, a) top view, b) cross section. [200\u00b5m particle impact, at 170m\/s at room\ntemperature].\nThus, in this intermediate\/transition damage mechanism there is compaction of the EB PVD TBC\ncolumns, but neither the near surface cracking of Mode I nor the gross plastic deformation, kinking and\ncracking of Mode III is observed. This compaction damage is attributed to the high porosity levels in the\ncolumns, which are never 100% dense, often containing up to 15% of nano-sized porosity together with\nintra-column pores. A similar type of compaction occurs during Mode I, here the damage is limited to one\nor two neighbouring columns, with any lateral cracks believed also to initiate from the elastic\/plastic\ninterface. However, when the impact is spread over a significant number of columns, as is Mode II\ncompaction damage, cracks do not initiate at this interface thus the transient loads on each column must be\nlower, below the fracture stress of the individual columns. This type of damage is observed for larger\nparticles traveling at intermediate velocities and is thought to be due to a lower rate of energy input by the\ndecelerating particle. This mechanism is still under investigation but it is evident from the initial single\nimpact studies that the Mode II damage mechanism is different from the other two and that cracking does\nnot occur under single impacts. Multiple impacts studies are underway to determine the exact mechanism\nthat is operating under Mode II conditions, which may well be a form of impact fatigue damage.\n3.3 Mode III - Foreign Object Damage (FOD)\nFOD is caused by large particles travelling at low velocities or smaller particles at higher velocities and is\n12\ncharacterised by significant deformation of the coating which can penetrate to the substrate and is\naccompanied by gross plasticity, deformation of the columns, shear bands and extensive cracking of the\nTBC ceramic [26],[9,17,35,41,42] as illustrated in Figure 10. Clearly, the extent of gross plasticity\nobserved varies with the component temperature when impacted, being greatest at 1200\u00baC and less\nprevalent at room temperature.\nFurther, recent studies have shown that, in fact, there are a number of distinct types of FOD. The SEM\nmicrograph in Figure 11 illustrates an additional form of FOD damage \u2013 termed type 2 FOD \u2013 where\nsignificant column buckling is observed. This mode was observed in high velocity, gas gun FOD tests at\nCranfield and demonstrates that EB PVD TBCs can deform plastically at elevated temperatures, in this\ncase 800\u00b0C [21].\n(a) 1200\u00baC (b) 900\u00baC\n(c) 800\u00baC (d) Room temperature.\nFigure 10: SEM micrographs illustrating the effect of FOD in an EB PVD TBC, a) damage at 1200\u00baC [21,55],\nb) damage at 900\u00baC [1mm spherical alumina particle at an estimate 100m\/s] [26] c) 800\u00baC [21] d) damage at\nroom temperature [0.5mm angular alumina particle at an estimated 100m\/s] [21].\nFrom these studies it appears that an additional type of foreign object damage can occur that involves\nsignificant buckling of the columns and plastic deformation without noticeable cracking. It is expected\nthat subsequent impacts would increase the degree of buckling in the columns until cracking initiated and\nmaterial was lost. FOD Type 1 is the standard accepted mechanism of gross plastic deformation of the\ncoating with the associated densification bending and cracking of the columns as shown in Figure 10 a-c.\nWhile Type 2 FOD is a relatively new observed damage mechanism and as illustrated in Figure 11\ninvolves gross plastic deformation of the TBC columns. These two mechanisms are not mutually\nexclusive and are discussed in the following sections.\n13\n3.3.1) Type 1 FOD\nType 1 FOD may give rise to either of two damage morphologies. These morphologies result from\nessentially the same mechanism, differing only in the relative degree of cracking and plastic deformation\nthat occurs, which is a direct result of the temperature of impact. As can be seen in Figure 10a-c (1200\u00b0C,\n900\u00baC and 800\u00baC) Type 1a FOD exhibits a significantly greater degree of plastic deformation under the\nimpact. Gross plastic deformation of the coating is in the form of compaction damage immediately below\nthe impact with associated bending and cracking of the columns to form lateral shear bands propagating\ndown to the ceramic\/substrate interface. Type 1b FOD (room temperature) exhibits noticeably less gross\nplasticity (Figure 10d) instead there is a significant amount of cracking observed in the columns of the\nsample due to the more brittle nature of the ceramic columns at room temperature.\nIt is under conditions of FOD that the effect of temperature becomes most noticeable in that the mode of\ndamage is directly affected by the temperature at which the impact occurs. After room temperature impact\nthe columns are still visible as discreet features, whereas as the temperature increases, impact conditions\nresult in the coating densifing as a whole. In other words the impact has caused adjacent columns to\ncompact together so that they are no longer discreet columns.\n3.3.2 Type 2 FOD\nThis mode of damage has only recently been observed in high temperature laboratory tests [21] and\ndemonstrates the ability of EB PVD TBCs to deform plastically without densification occurring. As can\nbe seen from Figure 11 the impacting particle has caused a number of columns in the coating to buckle\nwith virtually no cracking occurring. From these experiments [21] this mode of deformation can be\nexpected to occur at temperatures in excess of 800\u00b0C (being the temperature at which these tests were\nconducted) and possibly lower temperatures as well, provided the ceramic material exhibits sufficient\nplasticity. It is not expected that this damage mechanism will operate at room temperature.\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 FOD were found to occur in the same sample and are thus not mutually exclusive\nmechanisms. Which mode of damage occurs can be assumed to depend on the local impact conditions,\nand the constraint between neighbouring TBC columns.\nFigure 11: SEM micrograph illustrating type 2 FOD in EB PVD TBCs impacted at 800\u00b0C [21].\n14\n3.4 The Dimensionless Erosion Ratio D\/d\nThese different erosion mechanisms can also be described in terms of the ratio between the contact\ndiameter of the impacting particle and the column diameter. This is a similar principle to the measured\ndecrease in TBC hardness with increasing load [43], which relates to the number of columns with which\nthe indenter interacts as illustrated in Figure 12. This effect is due to the fact that at low loads the\nindenter is interacting with only one column and hence is measuring the hardness of a single column,\nhowever as the load increases the number of columns with which the indenter interacts increases resulting\nin greater system compliance and hence a lower measured hardness. As the load is increased the point is\nreached where the system compliance is no longer increasing and the hardness of the coating is being\nmeasured.\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n0 1 2 3 4\nLoad (N)\nH\nar\ndn\nes\ns\n(G\nPa\n)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\no\nfC\no\nu\nlm\nn\ns\nFigure 12: Effect of increasing load on the measured hardness of EBPVD TBCs.\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\nC\no\nn\nta\nct\nD\nia\nm\net\ner\n\/C\no\nlu\nm\nn\nD\nia\nm\net\ner\n(D\n\/d\n) RT Erosion\nHT Erosion\nRT Compaction\nHT Compaction\nRT FOD\nHT FOD\nFigure 13: Graph of measured D\/d ratios for different impact conditions.\n15\nThis observation initially led to the concept of the D\/d ratio, where D is the contact footprint diameter and\nd is the column diameter. This dimensionless ratio takes into account a number of otherwise difficult to\nresolve variables, including coating and particle mechanical properties, particle size and particle velocity.\nThe graph in Figure 13 shows that the D\/d ratio allows one to clearly determine the damage mechanism\nthat is operating under particle impact conditions. Further work needs to be conducted to couple the D\/d\nratio with the strain rate in order to generate a new type of erosion map. As can be seen from the graph in\nFigure 13 a D\/d ratio of less than 2 indicates an erosion mechanism, while a ratio of 2-12 indicates a\ncompaction mechanism and greater than 12 a foreign object damage mechanism. For the measured results\nso far it appears as though this ratio is independent of temperature. At this stage it is not possible to relate\nerosion rate directly to the D\/d ratio, since during FOD if the damage does not reach the ceramic bond\ncoat interface the erosion rate will be significantly lower than for cases where it does. This relationship\nhas not yet been studied for other systems although it could prove a useful tool for examining the erosion\nperformance of dual phase materials, for example WC-Co cermets and metal matrix composites.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 14: SEM micrograph showing erosion of a doped EBPVD TBC, a) at room temperature and b) at high\ntemperature.\nRecently Steenbakker et al [44] identified a new erosion mechanism while examining the effects of\ngadolinia additions on the erosion of EB PVD TBCs, where, due to the effect of the extremely narrow\ncolumns, 3-5\u00b5m diameter, the coating behaved more as a continuum than as discreet columns. As can be\nseen in Figure 14a lateral cracks appear to propagate across the column boundaries without any difficulty.\nHowever, under the high temperature (825\u00b0C) test conditions the erosion mechanism changed to a FOD\nmechanism, as illustrated in Figure 14b, with the associated cracking and kink bands. This change in\nmechanism was partly attributed to the increase in velocity of the 825\u00b0C tests over the room temperature\ntests and the associated increase in contact area, further illustrating the effect of the D\/d ratio on the\nerosion of EB PVD TBCs. During these tests the inlet gas pressure was maintained hence for the tests at\nhigh temperature, due to expansion, the gas outlet velocity was slightly higher than for the room\ntemperature tests thus resulting in a higher particle impact velocity. Since a number of factors contribute\nto the contact footprint diameter including velocity, an increase in velocity results in an increase in contact\ndiameter.\nThe dimensionless ratio D\/d has a number of advantages in determining the erosion regime for EB PVD\nTBCs and if coupled with strain rates during impact could be used to generate useful erosion maps. The\ncolumn diameter of EB PVD TBCs is fairly standard for a given deposition process and can also be easily\nmeasured. While the contact footprint diameter includes a large number of important variables into one\n16\nparameter, these variables include particle velocity, density, size and mechanical properties as well as the\nmechanical properties of the EB PVD TBC. The column diameters are easy to measure in cross section\nhowever, determining an accurate measure of the contact footprint diameter is slightly more difficult. In\nthe case of compaction damage it is possible to measure the contact footprint by measuring impact sites in\nthe SEM, in either the top view or cross section see Figure 9. This can also be done for FOD damage,\nhowever under erosion conditions this is very difficult to do. It is also possible to calculate the contact\nfootprint for impact conditions this has been covered in a previous paper [20].\n4.0 OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE EROSION OF TBCS\nThe first sections of this paper have covered the main erosion mechanisms of EB PVD TBCs and the\nrelationship between the impact conditions and the erosion rates of EB PVD TBCs particularly the\nrelationship between contact area and column diameter. This section will briefly consider other factors\nthat have a significant effect on the erosion response of TBCs including aging, dopent addition and\ncorrosion (CMAS attack).\n4.1 The Effect of Aging on the Erosion of PS and EB PVD TBCs\nFor many years now the erosion rate of plasma sprayed TBCs has been quoted as being in the order of 10\ntimes higher than their EB PVD equivalents as illustrated in Figure 3 of this paper. However, until\nrecently nearly all erosion testing has been conducted on samples in the as sprayed\/deposited condition,\nthus it was decided to determine the effects of aging on the erosion rates of both EB PVD and PS TBCs.\nIn order to do this a number of samples were aged before erosion testing, initial testing showed that as the\naging condition increases the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs increases as illustrated in Figure 15[23].\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nTBC AR 30hrs @\n1100\u00b0C\n100hrs @\n1100\u00b0C\n24hrs @\n1500\u00b0C\nCMAS\n24hrs @\n1500\u00b0C\nE\nro\nsi\no\nn\nR\nat\ne\n(g\n\/k\ng\n)\nFigure 15: Effect of aging condition on the erosion of EB PVD TBCs at 90\u00b0 impact and room temperature,\nwith data added showing the effect of CMAS on the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs [23]. TBC AR \u2013 as\nreceived EB PVD TBC, CMAS \u2013 sample with CMAS infiltration.\nThis increase in the erosion rates has been attributed to the sintering of columns together, giving rise to\nlarger \u2018columns\u2019, resulting in greater material removal per impact, when cracks are initiated in the coating.\nThis is due to the fact that when the columns sinter together the sintered column boundaries no longer\ninhibit crack growth and cracks initiated during impact propagate further across the near surface region of\nthe TBC resulting in greater material loss per impact[23]. In the as received condition the column\nboundaries all act as free surfaces and hence cracks initiated in one column do not propagate into the\nneighbouring columns. However, during sintering some of the columns will sinter together resulting in\nfewer larger columns within the coating; this sintering effect is illustrated in Figure 16. Note that not all\nthe columns sinter, thus there are still free surfaces to stop crack propagation. The effect of the CMAS on\nthe erosion rate is covered in section 4.3.\n17\nFigure 16: SEM micrograph of an EB PVD TBC showing sintering of the columns.\nMore recently the effects of aging on the erosion of PS TBCs (two different PS (from different suppliers)\nand one vertically cracked PS TBC) have been investigated with surprising results. As can be seen from\nthe graph in Figure 17, aging the samples for 100hrs at 1100\u00b0C results in a decrease in erosion rate for PS\nTBCs. The sample labelled VC PS (vertically cracked plasma sprayed) has an erosion rate approaching\nthat of an EB PVD TBC in the as received condition but after aging the erosion rates of the VC PS and the\nstd EB PVD TBC are almost identical (within experimental error). The erosion tests reported in Figure 15\nand 17 were all conducted under the same test conditions of room temperature and 90\u00b0 impact.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\nStd PS 1 Std PS 2 VC PS\nE\nro\nsi\no\nn\nR\nat\ne\n(g\n\/k\ng\n)\nAR\nAged\nFigure 17: Effect of aging on the erosion of PS TBCs, at 90\u00b0 impact and room temperature [45] (std PS \u2013\nstandard plasma sprayed sample as illustrated in Figure 1b, i.e. not vertical cracks).\nThis improvement in the erosion resistance of PS TBCs has been attributed to an increase in the intersplat\nbonding in the coating increasing the energy needed to initiate and propagate a crack along a splat\nboundary [45]. The erosion of PS TBCs has not been examined to the same degree as EB PVD TBCs,\nhowever, it is generally accepted that in PS TBCs erosion occurs via the initiation and propagation of\ncracks along the splat boundaries. This generally results in the loss of whole splats or groups of splats,\nthus any improvement in the adhesion between neighbouring splats will result in an increase in erosion\nresistance. This reduction in the erosion rate of the PS TBCs after aging is the opposite of what is\nobserved for EB PVD TBCs. This increase in the erosion rate of EB PVD TBCs with aging (time in\n18\nservice) and decrease in the erosion rate of PS TBCs with aging greatly reduces the difference in the\nerosion rates between these two classes of TBCs.\n4.2 The Effect of Dopent Additions on the Erosion of EB PVD TBCs\nAdditions of small quantities of rare earth oxides, for example gadolinia and dysprosia, have been shown\nto significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of EB PVD TBCs, thermal conductivities close to that of\nPS TBCs can be achieved with the addition of 2% gadolinia to a standard 7wt% yttria partially stabilized\nzirconia EB PVD TBC [46].\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nStd TBC 2%Dy 2% Gd 4% Gd\nE\nro\nsi\no\nn\nra\nte\n(g\n\/k\ng\n)\nAs Received\n24hr @ 1500\u00b0C\nFigure 18: Effect of gadolinia and dysprosia additions on the erosion of EB PVD TBCs at room temperature.\nHowever, as can be seen from the graph in Figure 18, the addition of dopents increases the erosion rate of\nEB PVD TBCs significantly; this increase is then further magnified when the samples are aged before\nerosion testing. In this graph: Std TBC \u2013 is an 7wt% ytttria partially stabilized EB PVD TBC, 2%Dy \u2013 is\na std EB PVD TBC doped with 2mol% dysprosia, 2%Gd \u2013 is a std EB PVD TBC doped with 2mol%\ngadoliniaia, 4%Gd \u2013 is a std EB PVD TBC doped with 4mol% gadoliniaia. This finding is similar to\nobservations made by Steenbakker et al investigating the effects of gadolinia on the erosion of EB PVD\nTBCs at both room and high (825\u00b0C) temperature [44].\n4.3 Corrosion of EB PVD TBCs (CMAS attack)\nUntil recently the maximum surface temperatures of TBCs during peak operation conditions was lower\nthan 1240\u00b0C and hence attack of the TBC by molten CMAS (calcium-magnesium-alumina-silicates) was\nnot an issue. However, as the drive to more efficient engines continues and the reliability and\nperformance of EB PVD TBCs improves, TBC surface temperatures of 1240\u00b0C and greater can occur\nduring normal operating conditions. This is the temperature at which CMAS melts and, as it has excellent\nwetting properties, it can easily penetrate into the structure of the TBC. Since the TBC is in a thermal\ngradient the depth of penetration of the CMAS is limited to the point at which the TBC temperature is\nequal to the melting temperature of the CMAS. The SEM micrograph in Figure 19 shows how CMAS\nattack causes degradation of the TBC columnar microstructure, note that the dark regions in the\nmicrograph are not porosity but in fact CMAS. This is accompanied by a metastable tetragonal (t\u2019) to\nmonoclinic (m) phase transformation with a significant degree of diffusion of Y and Zr into the infiltrating\nCMAS which fills the gaps between the TBC columns [47].\nHowever, this chemical attack is not the only problem associated with CMAS damage of EB PVD TBCs,\ndelamination of the regions infiltrated by the CMAS via a cold shock mechanism can cause significant\n19\nand rapid loss of the TBC [24]. Upon cooling of the TBC to below 1240\u00b0C the CMAS will solidify and\n\u2018lock\u2019 the infiltrated columns together thus affecting the strain tolerance of the TBC. During shut down of\nthe engine with its associated rapid cooling of the TBC high compressive stresses will develop in the\nsurface region which can initiate cracking parallel to the surface of the TBC. Future engine cycles will\nresult in the spallation of the TBC exposing \u2018fresh\u2019 TBC to CMAS attack.\nFigure 19: SEM micrographs of EB PVD TBCs that have been chemically attacked by CMAS prior to\nerosion testing, showing impact damage in the form of cracking.\nDuring erosion of EB PVD TBCs, cracks, initiated by particle impact in the erosion regime, do not\npropagate across the column boundaries, resulting in a relatively low erosion rate, when compared to the\nerosion rate of aged samples or FOD. These cracked sections of the columns are then easily removed\nfrom the coating on subsequent impacts. The graph in Figure 15 shows that CMAS attack reduces the\nerosion rate compared to as received EB PVD TBCs. This reduction in the erosion rate is attributed to the\nfact that the coating is now acting as a continuum, i.e. like a bulk solid see results of bulk zirconia in\nFigure 3, with cracks propagating parallel to the surface and material only being removed when the\npropagating cracks intersect with the surface or each other. Due to the fact that there are no free surfaces,\ncolumns boundaries, the cracked regions of the CMAS infiltrated TBC are not easily removed.\nThe case illustrated above is for total CMAS penetration into the coating. However due to the fact that\nTBCs operate in a temperature gradient CMAS is not expected to penetrate significantly into a coating\nduring normal operating conditions. If the penetration of the CMAS is only of the order of 20-30\u00b5m into\nthe coating it is quite possible that \u201cerosion-corrosion\u201d type mechanisms will start to operate and that\nerosion rates will be highly dependent on depth of CMAS penetration relative to the contact area \/ depth\nof impact of the erodent particle. It is also possible that thin layers of CMAS could result in an increase in\nerosion rate, however more work needs to be done to ascertain the effects of partial penetration of CMAS\non erosion rates.\n5. EROSION MODELS FOR EB PVD TBCS\nRecent work on TBC erosion has focused on understanding the material removal mechanisms for an EB-\nPVD thermal barrier coating system under the wide range of impact conditions that may be envisaged in a\ngas turbine, as depicted in the micrographs in section 3 of this paper. These modeling studies have\ninvolved a collaboration between researchers at Cambridge [22,48], Santa Barbara [9,41,49] and Cranfield\n[17,36,39,40,50], where Cranfield have provided much of the experimental evidence of the damage\nincurred. Cambridge has modeled the dynamics of particle impaction, examining in particular the\n20\nevolution, propagation and dissipation of energy from the elastic stress wave during impaction. Work at\nSanta Barbara has focused on elasto-plastic interactions during large particle impact (FOD), by utilizing a\nhigh temperature indentation system to examine the flow characteristics of the TBC under indentation\nload. They have developed finite element (F.E.) models of the TBC system and compared the models to\ndamage produced using depth sensing, spherical indentation, at temperature [9,22,41,42]. Figure 20\nillustrates schematically these two modes of damage. Figure 20a is representative of coating failure\nduring small particle erosion due to the propagation of elastic stress waves down the columns of an EB-\nPVD TBC. Figure 20b illustrates the gross plastic damage and shear banding that results from foreign\nobject damage (FOD).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 20: Schematic diagrams of particle impact dynamics on an EB-PVD TBC [22,48] a) elastic and b)\nplastic.\nModelling work at Cranfield [20,36,50] has focused on understanding the material removal mechanisms,\nand thus the development of a Mont\u00e9 Carlo model to predict EB PVD TBC erosion rates, whilst operating\nin the Mode I (small particle impact) damage regime. In support of this modeling work, and to provide\nindentation data (and mechanical properties) for individual columns and small clusters of columns, nano-\nand micro-indentation studies of the EB PVD columnar structure have been undertaken [43]\ncomplimenting the macro-indentation studies of Santa Barbara.\nFor completeness sake it is worth mentioning at this point that during the late 1980s and early 1990s\nTabakoff [16] did a significant amount of work modeling particle trajectories through first stage turbines.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has reviewed on-going research into the erosion and foreign object damage (FOD) to TBC\nsystems looking at various factors that influence wastage rates.\n21\nExperimental studies have shown that three primary damage regimes exist:-\nMode I : Small particle erosion, whereby damage is limited to the near surface region of the\nTBC and material removal results from cracking of neighbouring columns during impact, usually\nat a depth of 10-20\u00b5m, and the conjoint loss of material from a cluster of adjacent columns. At\nhigh temperatures plastic deformation of the near surface region is observed and this defines the\ndepth at which cracks propagate.\nMode II : Compaction damage occurs when gross plasticity\/densification is observed as a result\nof the impact event, but the induced stresses\/strains are insufficient to induce fracture within the\nTBC. In effect the impact energy density falls below some critical threshold. This mode has the\neffect of densifying the near surface of the coating, conditioning the TBC for later material\nremoval due to small particle erosion or FOD.\nMode III : Foreign Object Damage (FOD). This is in effect a ballistic impact event. At its\nlower bound it may result in compaction damage, with possible lateral\/shear crack development\ndue to the large strains introduced during impaction. At its upper bound, extensive plasticity\nand densification occurs. Strain fields interact through the TBC and with the bondcoat and TGO.\nUnder these conditions shear bands develop, propagating outward and down through the TBC,\nuntil they turn near the TGO interface to produce delamination cracks within the TBC ceramic,\nbut parallel to the bondcoat\/TGO\/TBC interface. This is potentially the most damaging of the\nthree mechanisms observed.\n\u2022 The transition between damage modes depends on:- impact velocity, particle size, temperature and\nthe relative size of the contact area to column diameter.\n\u2022 D\/d \u2013 Diameter Contact Area \/ Column Diameter is a critical experimental parameter that\ndetermines whether erosion\/compaction\/FOD occurs.\nThe effects of aging on the erosion rates are very different for EB PVD TBCs compared to PS TBCs:-\nAging of EB PVD TBCs results in a significant increase in the erosion rate due to the sintering of\nthe columns. This becomes more pronounced as the time and or temperature of aging increases.\nAging of plasma sprayed TBCs results in a decrease in the erosion rate due to the sintering of the\nintersplat boundaries.\nDopent additions of gadolinia (2-4%) and dysprosia (2%) have been shown to significantly increase the\nerosion rate of EB PVD TBCs.\nCMAS attack has been shown to degrade EB PVD TBC via a number of different mechanisms:\n\uf0b7 Degrades the columnar microstructure.\n\uf0b7 Facilitates the t\u2019 to monoclinic phase transformation.\n\uf0b7 On cooling the system to below the CMAS melting point the TBC loses its strain\ntolerance and becomes susceptible to a cold shock delamination degradation mechanism.\nHowever, when the CMAS penetrates a significant degree into the coating, the erosion rate is similar to\nthat for an as received EB PVD TBC. This is because the CMAS degraded coating will act as a\ncontinuum rather than as discreet columns.\n22\n7.
