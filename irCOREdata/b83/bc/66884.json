Academics from a variety of disciplines were brought together to ex-\nplore the social and cultural implications of deindustrialization on people and\ncommunities whose identities were once founded on industrialism and manu-\nfacturing. From the detailed accounts about individual lives, communities and\nregions, and the exact changes they have all been forced to undergo, a general\nstory was told. That is, many areas have recently witnessed the rapid and com-\nplete elimination of their industrial bases with seemingly nothing left in their\nplace. Today, the problems these areas face go beyond the matters of massive\nunemployment. There is also a sense of \u201cfolding in on oneself\u201d as the commu-\nnity attempts to find new structures upon which to reinvent itself. \u201cSoft out-\ncomes\u201d such as preserving a sense of pride, dignity and respectability were also\nshown to be significant to processes of social and economic regeneration. This\nstory is true for places throughout the world. What was especially highlighted by\nthis conference was the way in which an emergent international perspective on\ndeindustrialization was reflected in the combination of very local descriptions of\nparticular localities. Whether it be in Youngstown in Ohio, Consett, Sunderland,\nor South Shields in northeast England, Nowa Huta in southern Poland, Karhu-\nla in Finland, or in South Africa\u2019s East Rand, the impacts of globalization and\ndeindustrialization are both real and present for us all today.\nIn the opening Plenary Session about the impact of the destruction of the\nsteelworks on the local community in Youngstown, Sherry Linkon (Youngstown\nState University) touched upon many interdependent issues that later reap-\npeared in other presentations: the local social and physical landscape(s) impli-\ncated by local-regional-national-global dynamics of deindustrialization; notions\nof time interacting between past-present-future and the lifecourse; the (new) ef-\nfects of change; and memory and identity. The problems of representation, and\/\nor re-presentation, were brought up in different ways by all participants. More-\nover, within the theme of \u201crepresentation,\u201d and linking neatly with the title of\nthe conference itself, three broad thematic clusters emerged. These guide the\nsubsequent review of this conference and are delineated as follows: \u201cspace,\u201d\n\u201ccommunity,\u201d and \u201cclass.\u201d\nInternational Labor and Working-Class History\nNo. 61, Spring 2002, pp. 161\u2013164\n\u00a9 2002 International Labor and Working-Class History, Inc.\nRepresentations of space: Most of the papers offered a historical descrip-\ntion of a particular locality and the visibility of the changes therein. Caroline\nDixon and Pat Allat (University of Teeside) zoomed in on the reconfiguration\nof micro-landscapes of domestic interior space in relation to the daily experi-\nences of young people (aged sixteen to nineteen years) in full-time education in\nnortheastern England. In the UK, current post-sixteen educational policies em-\nphasise \u201cchoice\u201d and \u201cself-steering.\u201d However, Dixon and Allatt showed that\nstudents\u2019 experiences described a very different reality. Their study illustrated\nthe constant negotiation of time and place that young people increasingly face\ntoday. Here, a story was told of the competing demands of school and school-\nwork, home and family, and especially the part-time workplace. In such scenar-\nios, young people\u2019s identities are wedged tightly between family, place, class and\ngender structures as they (struggle to) juggle their daily activities. This study also\nraised the issue of the very aggressive youth labour market and how it is being\nintegrated into the exploited \u201cnormal market,\u201d something that has implications\nfor us all.\nCharlotte Waldron (University of Nottingham) also pointed to the dynam-\nics between capitalism, identity and space. She explored the processes of selec-\ntion into informal social groups at work. Her study focused on the shop floor of\na South Yorkshire food factory and revealed gendered differences in social net-\nwork formation. Women\u2019s identity and subsequent interactions, she found, cen-\ntred on events outside the workplace, such as marriage and\/or motherhood. For\nthe men, however, work-skills and training were the driving force behind their\nsocial dynamics. Waldron noted that different relationships between capitalism,\nidentity, and space imply different effects upon these things also at micro- and\nmacro-levels; vice-versa, different effects imply different interrelationships.\nRepresentations of \u201ccommunity\u201d: Debates around the concept of \u201ccom-\nmunity\u201d have existed for centuries. What this conference confirmed however, is\nthat the debates need to continue given the changing world we live in. On the\none hand, contributors noted that contemporary community identity emerges\nfrom new social networks situated within new workplaces, different labor pro-\ncesses, and changed (but still to some extent enforced) housing developments.\nSuch a slant revealed a shift from collective to individual identity and of a return\nto familial connections, not as consumers but as survivors. On the other hand,\nthe ways in which internal and external identities also provide important feed-\nback and feedforward loops within the dynamics of community formation were\nalso highlighted. For instance, Alison Stenning (University of Birmingham) de-\nscribed Nowa Huta\u2019s difficulty in remaking itself despite the potential opportu-\nnities embedded within its current identity. Stenning argued that this difficulty\nis due in part to the (negative) images that are maintained in various ways and\nwhich depict a town of the past, the old, retired, excluded; in short, of decay. The\nquestions raised in this second thematic cluster reiterated the need to examine\nthe power dynamics that constitute place, identity and transformation, as well as\nthose that organize the concepts of \u201cempowerment\u201d and \u201caccountability.\u201d\n162 ILWCH, 61, Spring 2002\nRepresentations of \u201cclass\u201d: Is it possible to accurately describe a commu-\nnity without making \u201cobjects\u201d of the individuals we seek to empower? This was\nthe underlying question raised throughout this last cluster about the problems\nof representation. Insofar as class is concerned, it was agreed that misrepresen-\ntations often result when the \u201cin-betweeness\u201d and \u201coverlapping\u201d of class is not\nfully appreciated. For instance, by taking these issues into account, Sue Parker\n(University of Durham) argued that contrary to the vast majority of literature\nabout class and motherhood, communitarian values (as opposed to individual-\nism) lie not with women from professional backgrounds but those \u201cothered\u201d\nwomen from more working-class backgrounds.\nIan Roberts (University of Durham) extended the issue of distorted repre-\nsentation by concentrating precisely on how authors convey class more gener-\nally. He argued that many accounts swing between romanticising and patholo-\ngizing working-class people and their communities. Importantly however, he did\nnot believe that the situation would be remedied through a better \u201cbalance\u201d be-\ntween these two poles. Instead, Roberts suggested that attempts to situate one-\nself within the class process of academic and literary discourse itself are con-\nducive to more accurate understanding of the interacting effects of both class\nidentity and knowledge about class.\nTom Woodin (Federation of Worker Writers and Community Publishers,\nFWWCP) implied something something similar to the arguments raised by both\nParker and Roberts. Woodin was one the many contributors who encouraged\nresearchers to be more creative in their methodological approaches precisely as\na means of better understanding the issue of class at the same time as trying to\navoid objectifying those we seek to know more about. He encouraged support\nfor organizations that (like the FWWCP) promote oral history projects, poetry,\nautobiographical writing, etc., which are developed and published by working-\nclass and marginalized people. Woodin argued that such oranizations directly\nempower their participants and he illustrated the richness that these \u201calterna-\ntive\u201d sources of knowledge offer to researchers. Woodin\u2019s argument is particu-\nlarly significant given that one way of \u201cgiving people a voice\u201d is to offer a time\nand place in which, and the resources with which, they can express their views.\nIn turn, this allows those who want to listen with an opportunity to do so.\nThis workshop conference provided an excellent forum in which to raise in-\nterconnected issues related to understanding the impacts of deindustrialization\nupon local people and their communities. What was particularly poignant was\njust how much there is to be learnt from knowing more about like stories inter-\nnationally. In this case, we concentrated on local stories about class, deindustri-\nalization and globalization. What emerged was that the similarities and differ-\nences between local trajectories globally in fact generate a spatio-temporal\nimage of the complex and multi-dimensional dynamics that are at play every-\nwhere. The image is one of change, but patterns of change. Furthermore, the\nchange takes on characteristics that are distinctly dependent upon contingent\nand local circumstances. In terms of policy implications therefore, the need is for\nin-depth local knowledge of communities and their localities combined with\nClass, Space and Community: A Workshop Conference 163\nbroader global knowledge of the sorts of trajectories that are going on around\nthe world.\nA final point that the Class, Space and Community workshop conference\nraised is the reality of how \u201cthe past continues to shape the present as the pres-\nent continues to erase the past.\u201d The direction of some trends seems unavoid-\nable. What was concluded however, was that it is nevertheless important to con-\ntinue to ask questions that challenge the inevitability of these temporal stories\nof change. The consensus was that some of the answers may be found through\nmore inter-disciplinary discussions. Reflexive dialogue between actors involved\nin the multiple structures that frame and fuel culture and politics was seen to be\nparamount to any solutions. The thought being that cross-disciplinary commu-\nnication could reveal tools, languages, and materials that would benefit research\nmethods as well as policy planning and implementation. It was certainly recog-\nnized that finding and implementing real alternatives to the impacts of deindus-\ntrialization was an extremely difficult task. However, for ethical reasons if not\nfor personal ones, it was also agreed that efforts to do so must continue.\n164 ILWCH, 61, Spring 2002\n"}
