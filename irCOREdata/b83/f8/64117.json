The programme began in \nthe late 1960s in the north of the country and, working southwards, is due to complete \ncoverage by 2020. The programme is based primarily on the collection of stream \nsediment samples at a density of 1 per 1.5 km2, however, rural soil samples (at a \nsample density of 1 per 2 km2) and a greater range of determinands in stream waters \nhave been incorporated into the programme in more recent years (see Johnson et al. \nthis volume). Historically, the programme avoided sampling in urban areas so that the \nrural geochemical baseline could be established.  \nHowever, at the start of the 1990s, United Kingdom (UK) government targets \nto build 60% of new homes (4.4 million) on brownfield sites by 2016 and city \nregeneration programmes lead to an increased interest in the quality of urban land \n(DETR 1998). In response to growing concerns about potentially harmful elements \n(PHE) in the urban environment and new statutory requirements for UK local \nauthorities to manage contaminated land (Environmental Protection Act Part IIa \n1990), urban geochemical mapping commenced in 1992.  \nThe Geochemical Surveys of Urban Environments (GSUE) project, developed \nfrom preliminary studies carried out in collaboration with Imperial College, London \nin Wolverhampton and Richmond-on-Thames (Kelly et al. 1996; Bridge et al. 1997; \nKelly 1997) and to date, 21 urban centres have been sampled (McMillan et al. 2001 \nand Fig. 1). \nThe concentrations of many PHE are enhanced in the urban environment as a \nresult of atmospheric and terrestrial contamination and the nature of urban ground, \nF M Fordyce et al. 2\nwhich is often disturbed and in-filled and bears little relation to the soils, bedrock and \nsuperficial cover of the surrounding rural hinterland (Thornton et al. 1985; Wong \n1996; Birke & Rauch 2000; Mielke et al. 2000; Sanchez-Martin et al. 2000; Tijhuis et \nal. 2002; Imperato et al. 2003; Peltola & Astrom 2003). Even in completely \nundisturbed urban areas such as parks, many PHE signatures are elevated relative to \nthe rural background due to atmospheric contamination, littering, urban surface run-\noff and other factors (Chronopoulos et al. 1997; Ander et al. 2001).  Hence it is \nnecessary to establish the overall urban signature so that areas of concern within a city \ncan be highlighted and detailed site investigation and contamination studies can be \nassessed in terms of the urban geochemical profile in addition to the rural background. \nIt should be noted that systematic urban surveys do not replace the need for site-\nspecific contaminated land investigations; rather the data provide the citywide \nframework and context to more detailed assessments. \n \nMETHODS \nUrban surveying is based upon the collection of soil samples on a systematic grid. \nSoils are sampled at a density of 4 per km2 across the built-up area whereby each UK \nNational Grid kilometre square as defined from 1: 25 000 scale topographic maps \n(Ordnance Survey\u00ae) is split into four 500 m x 500 m sub-cells. Samples are collected \nfrom open ground as close as possible to the centre of each 500 m cell. Typical \nlocations for sampling include gardens, parks, sports fields, road verges, allotments, \nopen spaces, schoolyards and waste ground. Whilst attempts are made to select the \nleast disturbed area of open ground as close as possible to the centre of the 500 m cell, \ncontamination is not purposefully avoided as the aim of the survey is to provide an \noverview of the urban geochemistry and not to establish a \u2018near natural\u2019 geochemical \nF M Fordyce et al. 3\nbaseline. Although the aim is a systematic survey, the regularity of the sampling grid \nis often constrained by the amount of surface sealing and accessibility of soils in the \ncity environment (see Johnson et al. this volume). \nA standard depth rather than horizon-based sampling strategy is adopted to be \nconsistent with rural G-BASE soils (see Johnson et al. this volume) and because soil \nprofiles in the urban environment are often poorly developed and disturbed. Surface \n(0.05 to 0.20 m) and profile (0.35 to 0.50 m) samples are collected using a handheld \nDutch auger. Each sample is a composite of five sub-samples collected from the \ncorners and centre of a 20 x 20 m square in accordance with standard G-BASE \n(Johnson et al. 2003) and international (Salminen et al. 1998) methods (Fig. 2).  This \nsampling strategy provides information on the chemistry of near-surface soils, which \nmay be influenced by atmospheric contamination, and of deeper soils, which should \nmore closely represent substrate materials at each site. The sub-samples are \nhomogenised at site to form one surface sample and one deeper sample from each \nlocation. \nObservations of soil colour, depth and clast lithology and abundance are \nrecorded at site, and the samples are classified into five textural groups (sand, sand-\nsilt, silt, silt-clay and clay). Information on the location, geology, contamination, land \nuse and other features required for data interpretation are also entered on a computer-\ncompatible data-card in a standard G-BASE\/GSUE format (see Johnson et al. this \nvolume). \nFollowing collection, the soils are air- and then freeze-dried at < 30 \u00b0C to \nprevent the volatilsation of Se and Hg. During the 1990s the surface soil samples were \nsieved to < 2 mm, the environmental standard whereas deeper soil samples were \nsieved to < 150 \u00b5m to be compatible with the rural stream sediment and soil data \nF M Fordyce et al. 4\ncollected under the G-BASE programme. However, since 2000 both surface and \ndeeper soil samples have been sieved to < 2 mm to allow better down-profile \ncomparisons. The samples are then homogenised, coned and quartered and a 30 g sub-\nsample ground in an agate planetary ball mill until 95 % is < 53 \u00b5m. The pulverised \nmaterial is further sub-sampled to obtain portions for analysis. The number of \ndeterminands has increased from 18 in the early 1990s to the current suite of 46 total \nelement concentrations by X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (XRFS) (Ingham & \nVrebos 1994; Johnson et al. this volume). These include elements of concern in terms \nof contaminated land such as As, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb (Table 1). However, the major \nelement composition (for example, CaO, K2O, Fe2O3 and MnO), soil pH and loss on \nignition (LOI), as an indicator of organic matter content, are also analysed as these \nfactors can influence the mobility of PHE in soils.  Soil pH is determined by adding \n10 g of < 2 mm sample to 25 ml of 0.01M CaCl2.2H2O (calcium chloride). The \nmixture is shaken to form a slurry prior to analysis by pH electrode. This method of \npH determination generally gives lower results (0.5 pH units) than water based \nmethods (Rowell 1994). LOI is determined on 2 g of < 2 mm material heated in a \nfurnace and kept at 450 \u00b0C for a minimum of 4 hours.  \nOnce preparation is completed, sample residue materials are stored in the \nGSUE sample archive where they form part of the BGS National Geoscience Data \nCentre collection (Johnson et al. this volume). \nThe analytical results undergo the rigorous quality assurance procedures \nfollowed by the G-BASE programme (Johnson et al. this volume). Systematic error in \nfield sampling and analysis is monitored using a method based on randomised sample \nsite numbers (Plant 1973). Field-based procedures at each stage of the sampling \nprocess are designed to minimise error (Johnson et al. 2003). Six percent of the \nF M Fordyce et al. 5\nsamples analysed are controls comprising field duplicate, analytical replicate and \nprimary and secondary reference materials. Long-term analytical drift between \nbatches of samples is monitored using time versus concentration plots for each of the \nreference samples. Tolerance limits are arbitrarily set at mean \u00b1 2\u03c3 to assess data \nquality. Simple arithmetic correlations are applied to normalise the data for systematic \ndrift. Values below the lower limit of detection are assigned to a value of one half of \nthe detection limit and all field duplicate sample results removed prior to statistical \ntreatment (for example BGS 2000).  \nSampling and analytical precision are calculated using a procedure based on \nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). Plots of cumulative frequency versus concentration \nfor each element in the soils are examined to assess the degree to which the elements \nconform to a Gaussian distribution; in most cases elements are log-transformed before \nundergoing ANOVA, to improve their conformity to the model distribution (Plant et \nal. 1975). \nA random nested model of ANOVA is used because all the analyses are part \nof a single randomised dataset (Snedecor & Cochran 1989). The NESTED procedure \nfrom the SAS\u2122 statistical software package is used to perform the ANOVA (SAS \nInstitute Inc. 1989). Residual variance (representing inter-alia inhomogeneities \nintroduced in sample preparation and sub-sampling, and errors in chemical analysis), \nbetween-sample variance (representing within-site variability as well as any \nvariability introduced by the process of sample collection) and between-site variance \n(representing the distribution of the elements in the soils) are calculated.  \nHowever, it should be noted that because the frequency distribution of most \nelements is multi-modal and none fit the Gaussian model perfectly, there is an \nunquantifiable overstatement of the between-site variance a problem that is inherent \nF M Fordyce et al. 6\nin using ANOVA on geochemical data. Statistical F-tests are not quoted because the \ndata do not satisfy this and other assumptions required for formal ANOVA. Rather the \ndata are described in terms of percentiles of the data distribution and \u2018average\u2019 values \nare based on the median concentration. \nThe percentage of variance attributable to between-site, between-sample and \nresidual variance of duplicate and replicate surface soil pairs from 11 urban centres \n(Cardiff, Swansea, Stoke-on-Trent, Telford, York, Kingston-upon-Hull (Hull), \nDoncaster, Mansfield, Scunthorpe, Lincoln and Sheffield) are given in Table 2, and \nprovide a general indication of the reliability of the geochemical data. In most cases \nover 90 % of the variability can be attributed to between-site variance demonstrating \nthe robustness of the field sampling method. ANOVA results for Cu, Cd, Sn and U \nfall below the 90 % between-site-variance level largely as a result of the \ninhomogeneous nature of urban soils. Sample preparation and analytical variability \n(residual variance) is very low (< 1.6 % for most elements) indicating the reliability of \nthe analytical techniques. Results for Cd, Sb, Sn and U probably reflect the fact that \nconcentrations of these elements in soils are close to the limit of detection (Lister \n2002). \nOnce error controlled and spatially registered, the urban geochemical data are \nstored digitally in the corporate BGS Geochemistry Database and are available to \nusers under licence (Johnson et al. this volume; Coats & Harris 1995). \n \nDATA PRESENTATION \nGeochemical data can be presented in a number of formats; the standard method for \nrural G-BASE data is as interpolated maps in the BGS series of geochemical atlases \n(for example, BGS 1997; BGS 2000). These maps comprise computer-generated \nF M Fordyce et al. 7\nsurface grids for each element produced by interpolation of the real data using Inverse \nDistance Weighting (IDW) (Johnson et al. this volume). An example of a gridded \nurban soil geochemical map is given in Figure 3 and shows the concentrations of Pb \nin deeper (0.50 m) soils derived from a survey of 285 urban sites in the city of \nWolverhampton in the English West Midlands undertaken in 1992-1993. The \nsurrounding rural data are derived from the G-BASE regional survey completed as \npart of the Welsh and West-Central England geochemical atlas area (BGS 2000). \nWhilst the interpolated maps are a robust presentation method for rural geochemical \ndata where element distributions tend to form regional patterns, urban soils are highly \nheterogeneous and variable over small distances and there is concern that urban data \npresented in this way could be misinterpreted if not accompanied by validation \ninformation to give an estimate of the likely level of error in the interpolation. \nANOVA investigations of field duplicate data indicate that the urban sampling \nmethodology is valid, namely samples collected from the same site are more similar \nthan samples from different sites (Lister 2002). However, further studies into the \nspatial variability of urban data using nested sampling, variogram and cross-validation \ntechniques (Fordyce & Ander 2003; Rawlins & Brown 2003) and geostatistical \nassessments of various gridding algorithms (Nathanial et al. 1997) demonstrate a \nlarge nugget effect of a range of PHE, namely that differences between concentrations \nover very short distances are similar to those at increasing distance. Hence commonly \nused interpolation techniques are likely to be of limited use. Indeed due to dilation \neffects caused by the programme algorithms, interpolated maps do not provide a \nsuitable method for presenting urban data. At the close scale of interrogation \nnecessary in urban areas, interpolations can give misleading results, as the spatial \nextent of high element values can be over-emphasised.  \nF M Fordyce et al. 8\nAs a result, methods of presenting urban geochemical data as graduated \nsymbol maps using ArcView\u00ae\/ArcGIS\u00ae geographic information system (GIS) \nsoftware packages have been adopted (Fig. 4). Figure 4 shows the concentrations of \nAs in surface soils collected from 747 sites over an area of 195 km2 from the urban \narea of Stoke-on-Trent in the English Midlands during 1993. Although the \ngeochemical patterns are not as readily identified as they are on interpolated maps, \npresentation of the data as graduated symbol maps avoids uncertain extrapolation \nbetween sampling points. Interpolated maps are still used with caution by the GSUE \nproject to assess rural-urban soil comparisons and multi-element associations.  \nOnce, plotted the GSUE data are presented as a series of BGS urban \ngeochemistry reports (for example, Morley & Ferguson 2001; Brown 2003; Fordyce \n& Ander 2003; Rawlins & Brown 2003; Freestone et al. 2004; O\u2019Donnell 2004).  \n \nDATA APPLICATIONS \nUrban geochemical data have a number of applications to current UK land quality \nlegislation and urban planning needs as follows: \n \nLegislative drivers \n The distribution of chemical elements in the environment is of concern because \nalthough many are essential to life, at least 26 of the naturally occurring elements are \npotentially harmful to plants and animals in high doses (Mertz 1986; Fergusson 1990; \nWHO 1996; Fordyce & Ander 2003). Many UK city environments have a long \nhistory of urbanisation resulting in elevated concentrations of PHE such as As, Cd, \nCr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn derived from industrial and mineral processing and the \natmospheric deposition of Pb and other toxins from traffic fumes and power \nF M Fordyce et al. 9\ngeneration (Thornton et al. 1985; Moir & Thornton 1989; Farago et al. 1996; Paterson \net al. 1996; Wang et al. 1997; Farmer et al. 1999). Whether or not these substances \nconstitute a hazard depends on a variety of factors. These include their chemical form, \nconcentration, mobility and behaviour in the environment, the extent to which they \nare taken up by living organisms (bioavailability), the properties of the substrate in \nwhich they occur such as the acidity of waters or soils, the soil texture and mineral \ncomposition, the level of exposure and the dose received (Farmer et al. 1989; \nThornton et al. 1994; Mielke et al. 1997; Rieuwerts et al. 1998; DEFRA-EA 2002a; \nDEFRA-EA 2002b; Hough et al. 2004). \nIn UK urban areas, the major pathways via which PHE can enter the human \nbody are through the inhalation of dusts and gases; direct contact with and ingestion \nof contaminated soil in gardens, play areas and allotments etc. Soil ingestion can be \ninadvertent for example from vegetables grown in the urban environment or from \nhand to mouth contact, especially in children. Deliberate eating of soils is also \ncommon among children. Water is unlikely to pose a risk to human health due to the \nhigh standard of public water quality in UK and the minimal use of private wells in \ncity areas; however, the protection of water resources is a major issue in the urban \nenvironment (DEFRA-EA 2002a; DEFRA-EA 2002b).   \nPrompted by concerns about land and water quality, national governments and \ninternational agencies are developing policies to limit the amount and impacts of PHE \nin the environment. Although links between long term human health effects and PHE \nare often difficult to prove, the majority of regulatory authorities adopt a \nprecautionary principal approach to legislate against high environmental \nconcentrations. In the UK, the Environmental Protection Act, Part IIa (1990) places \nthe responsibility for the identification, assessment, remediation and monitoring of \nF M Fordyce et al. 10\ncontaminated land with local authorities and is based on a \u2018suitable for use\u2019 approach. \nLand is categorised as contaminated only if the current or intended use of a site has \nthe potential to cause \u2018significant harm\u2019 to four receptors namely humans, \necosystems, water resources and buildings and operates a \u2018polluter pays\u2019 principle in \nterms of remediation. However, it is important to point out that Part IIa only applies to \na sub-set of land that is chemically contaminated. The identification of contaminated \nland relies on the concept of risk assessment, based on a pollutant linkage whereby \nthe presence or source of contamination has the potential to impact on a receptor by \nmeans of a pathway (Fig. 5). This approach requires that land be assessed for \nredevelopment on a site-specific basis (DETR 2000).  \nThreats to water quality are not only addressed under the UK Environmental \nProtection Act but are directly linked to the European Union (EU) Water Framework \nDirective, which requires the protection of all surface and groundwater bodies (CEC \n1998; EA 2002).  \n \nSoil guideline values and human risk assessment \nIn terms of human risk assessment, in 2002 the UK government launched the \nContaminated Land Exposure Assessment (CLEA) model (DEFRA-EA 2002c). The \nmodel adopts an ecotoxicological approach and considers the exposure to \ncontaminants from the direct and indirect ingestion and inhalation of soils (DEFRA-\nEA 2002a).  To date, generic soil guideline values (SGV) for As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Hg, Ni \nand Se have been defined (DEFRA-EA 2003b) (Table 3). The GSUE project provides \ninformation for all these elements with the exception of Hg, which due to budgetary \nconstraints is not analysed routinely. Summary statistics for these PHE in surface soils \nfrom 14 urban centres are presented for the first time in Table 3.  It is anticipated that \nF M Fordyce et al. 11\ndata for the remaining 7 urban centres surveyed will be available by 2005. Table 3 \nrepresents the most comprehensive dataset on contaminant concentrations in UK \nurban soils since the work of Thornton et al. (1985). \nAlthough the standard way to plot geochemical maps is using a full range of \npercentiles to describe the data distribution (Fig. 4), the data can also be presented to \nshow where the SGV are exceeded thus highlighting areas for further investigation \nand follow-up.  Figure 6 shows locations in the Stoke-on-Trent urban area where As \nconcentrations in surface soils are above the SGV of 20 mg\/kg for residential use \n(DEFRA-EA 2002d). The large number of sites reflects the general dispersion of As \nin the environment around Stoke-on-Trent due to the presence and exploitation of \ncoal-bearing strata in the area; the dispersal of coal waste products as fill materials \nacross the urban environment and the long industrial history of the city. However, the \nlarge number of sites is also a consequence of the low SGV for this element relative to \nnatural abundances (Fordyce & Ander 2003). Indeed further examination of As \nconcentrations in surface soils from 13 of the cities surveyed by the GSUE project \ndemonstrates that more than 50 % of the soils sampled in Swansea, Manchester, \nScunthorpe, Sheffield and Hull are above the SGV of 20 mg\/kg, which again is not \nonly a measure of the industrial heritage of these cities but of the relatively low \nguideline value for this element compared to its natural distribution (Fig. 7). Although \nthe SGV is exceeded, it is essential to point out that this is not an indication of actual \nrisk, rather that further assessments should be carried out (DEFRA-EA 2002d). The \nBGS is working with a number of authorities to follow up areas highlighted by the \nGSUE survey for more detailed investigation.  \nFor example, a geochemical survey of 389 soils from 97 km2 carried out in \n2000 in the urban area of Coventry in the English Midlands, highlighted allotments \nF M Fordyce et al. 12\nwith soil Cd concentrations in excess of the 1 mg\/kg at soil pH 6 SGV for areas where \nplants are grown. The mean pH of soils in the allotments was 6.1. Since the CLEA \nmodel assumes that 99 % of the exposure to Cd may be through the consumption of \nhomegrown vegetables (DEFRA-EA 2002e) there was potential concern of a source-\npathway-receptor linkage and risk to human health. Results of a follow-up soil and \nvegetation survey carried out in conjunction with the city authority demonstrate that \nthe high Cd (> 1 mg\/kg) and low pH (< 6) values are not spatially extensive.  The \nlevels of Cd in vegetables are all below the European Union (EU) regulatory limit of \n0.2 mg\/kg fresh weight (FW) for leafy and 0.1 mg\/kg FW for stem and root \nvegetables (CEC 2001). The average daily exposure to Cd in soil estimated using the \nCLEA model indicates no significant toxicological risk for gardeners working at the \nallotments (Rawlins & Brown 2003; Palumbo et al. 2004).  \nThe GSUE data have also been used to develop risk assessment methods to \ndetermine Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn exposure for populations living on and growing food \nin urban locations (Hough et al. 2004). The study showed that element concentrations \nin homegrown vegetables predicted from the GSUE soil data for Wolverhampton \nwere satisfactory with the exception of Pb. This is probably because plant Pb uptake \nvia the root system is limited and the main source of Pb contamination in vegetables \nis via atmospheric deposition (Dalenberg & Van Driel 1990). The study also \ndemonstrated that the majority of the population were at low risk of health effects \nfrom vegetables grown on urban soils but highlighted particular areas associated with \nroad junctions, railways and canals that may be inappropriate for residential use. \nThe UK SGV are based upon the assumption that 100 % of the elements in \nsoil are bioavailable (DEFRA-EA 2002b), and one of the further steps in a source-\npathway-receptor risk assessment is to investigate the likely bioavailability of \nF M Fordyce et al. 13\npotential contaminants in soil. In addition to studies of plant uptake, data from the \nGSUE project are being used to develop quantitative analytical methods to assess the \nhuman bioaccessibility of PHE in soils that are directly consumed. These are known \nas physiologically based extraction tests (PBET) and are designed to mimic \nconditions in the stomach during soil ingestion giving a more accurate assessment of \nexposure. The tests originated in the United States and to date have been validated \nagainst animal models for As and Pb (Ruby et al. 1996). The methods have been \nadapted for use in the UK and for example, when applied to surface soils from \nCardiff, demonstrate that although total As concentrations of up to 150 mg\/kg are \nrecorded, the bioaccessibility ranges from only 6 to 15% (Cave et al. 2003). The \nrange in values highlights the site-specific nature of bioaccessibility, particularly in \nheterogeneous urban environments. This information is being used by the UK \nEnvironment Agency (EA) to direct its policy on the use of bioaccessibility data for \ningested As in risk assessments. \n \nThreats to water quality \nThe potential threats to groundwater from contaminants leaching down-profile from \nsurface soils have been assessed using the GSUE data for Stoke-on-Trent (Fordyce & \nAnder 2003). The method utilised the Blume & Brummer (1991) and Boden (1994) \ngroundwater vulnerability-leaching model, which requires the input of parameters that \ncontrol the attenuation of specified contaminants in soils such as pH, organic matter, \nclay and sesquioxide contents.  Soil pH and organic matter (LOI %) are measured as \npart of the GSUE survey and could be incorporated directly into the model. Clay and \nsesquioxide contents are not determined routinely but a simple system to derive this \nF M Fordyce et al. 14\ninformation from GSUE soil texture and colour data was developed (Fordyce & \nAnder 2003). \nThe results demonstrate that due to the calcareous nature of the Coal Measures \nbedrock in Stoke-on-Trent and the base-rich character of the made ground underlying \nthe city, soil pH values are circum-neutral over much of the area. As a result, the \nmajority of soils have a high attenuation capacity and the leaching potential of the 11 \ncontaminants examined (Cd, Mn, Ni, Co, Zn, Al, Cu, Cr Pb, Hg and Fe) is generally \nlow. Although the model does not require soil PHE data, the benefit of the GSUE \nsurvey is that the element concentrations are known and can be evaluated in \nconjunction with the leaching potential results.  Comparisons show that the regions of \nhigh element concentrations in the city centre correspond to soils with poor leaching \npotential therefore the risks of pollutant migration to groundwater are less. Potential \nleaching risks over the Triassic sandstones on the southeast of the urban periphery are \nof greater concern because of the poorer attenuation capacities of these soils and the \nimportance of the Triassic sandstone aquifer for drinking water abstraction. However, \ncomparisons with the GSUE data show that the majority of PHE in soils are found in \nlow concentration over this lithology (Fig. 8).  \nWhilst it is possible to draw these very generalised conclusions about \ngroundwater vulnerability using the GSUE data it should be noted that the \nhydrogeology of urban areas is normally extremely complex and further assessments \nof potential threats to groundwater quality are hampered due to the lack of net \ninfiltration and depth to groundwater information. Although groundwater \nvulnerability maps produced by the EA in conjunction with the BGS and the National \nSoil Survey are available for England and Wales, urban areas are not characterised \nF M Fordyce et al. 15\nbecause of the unknown properties of urban fill materials (EA 1998; Palmer & Lewis \n1998).  \n \nRural - urban comparisons \nTo provide an overview of the increased levels of PHE in urban environments relative \nto rural background, median values for urban areas can be compared to results for \nnational datasets. National soil geochemical data generated by the Soil Survey of \nEngland and Wales National Inventory comprise surface soil total element \nconcentrations (< 2 mm fraction) based on collection at a sample density of 1 per 25 \nkm2 (McGrath & Loveland 1992) (Table 3). However, it should be noted that although \nthe sampling depth (0.15 m) is similar to the GSUE surface soils, the analysis of the \nnational samples is based on an extraction rather than a total technique (aqua-regia 4:1 \nHCl:HNO3 vol\/vol followed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission \nspectrometry). This is likely to lead to some bias in the results when comparing one \ndataset to the other. None the less, comparisons of the median values demonstrate that \nin general Cd, Cr and Ni concentrations are elevated up to 2.5 to 3 times and Pb up to \n5 times national levels in most of the 14 cities presented in Table 3 giving an \nindication of the degree of contamination in the urban environment. Whilst these \ncomparisons are interesting, they do not take account of natural variations in the rural \nbaseline around individual cities. \nThe benefits of a systematic urban (GSUE) and regional (G-BASE) \ngeochemical survey are that direct comparisons between urban and rural \nenvironments are possible. For example, Figure 3 shows the concentration of Pb in \ndeeper (0.50 m) soils in the environment around Wolverhampton. Enhanced \nconcentrations of the element in the urban environment are very evident relative to the \nF M Fordyce et al. 16\nrural hinterland. On a regional scale, Figure 9 shows information for Cu from seven of \nthe urban centres in the Humber-Trent region of England in relation to the \nsurrounding G-BASE rural soils data. Between 1994 and 1996, 6 500 soil samples \nwere collected by the G-BASE programme throughout this part of rural eastern \nEngland covering a total area of around 13 000 km2. The rural-urban comparisons \ndemonstrate that Hull and Sheffield, show greatest enhancement of Cu relative to \nrural baseline conditions.  \nRural-urban relationships have been investigated in more detail in Stoke-on-\nTrent. Table 4 outlines the data ranges for selected total element concentrations in G-\nBASE rural and GSUE urban soils for the area. The rural soil samples were collected \nas part of the Northwest England and North Wales and Wales and West-Central \nEngland geochemical atlas areas (BGS 1997; BGS 2000). For the purposes of the \nrural-urban comparisons, a sub-set of the rural data was selected from an area \nunderlain by the same lithological units as the city over a 10 km radius around Stoke-\non-Trent. On the basis of median values for deeper soils, the urban area contains c. \n1.2 times the average Cr, Ni, Sn, Pb and Zn of the rural hinterland, whereas As shows \nlittle elevation in the urban soils relative to rural background (Fordyce & Ander \n2003). Using GIS technology, it is now possible to readily select sub-sets of the \ngeochemical data based on particular areas of interest. This is extremely useful to \nexamine the relationships between rural and urban soils over particular stratigraphic \nunits and parent materials in more detail (Fig. 10). Stoke is primarily underlain by \nWestphalian age sandstones, mudstones and coals and the Triassic age Sherwood \nSandstone and Mercia Mudstone Groups (Wilson et al. 1992). Concentrations of V, \nFe2O3, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn in soils are highest over the Westphalian rocks relative to \nother the stratigraphic units as expected due to the presence of coals (Fig. 10). \nF M Fordyce et al. 17\nHowever, these \u2018natural\u2019 geochemical variations are small compared to the contrast \nbetween rural and urban environments. Figure 10 shows that in almost all cases, \nelement concentrations are enhanced in the urban relative to the rural environment for \neach stratigraphic unit. As a further comparison, the ratios of element median values \nin the urban versus rural deeper soils for each parent material type are shown in Table \n5. Soils over river terrace deposits show some of the greatest increases in element \nconcentrations between rural and urban environments (for example, MnO x2.7, Zn \nx2.9, Pb x2.4 and Sn x2.8). This may indicate that these deposits act as sinks for \ncontaminants in cities and may also reflect the historical preference for locating \nindustrial activity on the banks of drainage systems (Fordyce & Ander 2003). \n \nInter-city comparisons \nOne of the benefits of a national systematic urban survey is that the results from \ndifferent cities can be compared directly. For example, Figure 11 shows the median \nconcentration of selected elements in Stoke-on-Trent, Cardiff, Telford and Swansea \nsurface soils. These cities are all underlain by Westphalian Coal Measures and have a \nlong history of industrialisation. Interestingly, the results are rather similar with the \nexception of Swansea where the import of ores and metal smelting contributes \nsignificantly to the soil contaminant load (Morley & Ferguson 2001). Equally, Table 3 \ndemonstrates that median concentrations of Cr are highest in Glasgow and Sheffield \nsurface soils, two cities renowned throughout the world for their ore processing and \nsteel making histories. In contrast, median concentrations of As, Cr, Ni and Pb in \nLincoln and Mansfield are relatively low compared to other cities as these are small \nless industrialised urban centres (Table 3). Similarly, concentrations of Cu in Lincoln \nsurface soils are similar to the rural baseline (Fig. 9). These comparisons are useful to \nF M Fordyce et al. 18\nestablish \u2018typical\u2019 urban geochemical signatures and highlight exceptions that can be \nattributed to different current and historic land uses. \n \nContaminant sources in the environment \nRural-urban and inter-city comparisons are also important in the context of \nidentifying possible contaminant sources in the environment. \nUnder the UK contaminated land regime, local authorities are required to \nidentify and develop a strategy for managing contaminated land and the guidance to \nachieve this is based largely on current and historical land use. The likely types of \ncontaminants associated with particular industrial activities are considered (DOE \n1994; DOE 1995). However, the advantage of geochemical information is that the \nactual levels of contamination in the environment can be assessed independent of \nassumptions related to land use.  \nA broad-scale example is that in the highly industrialised city of \nWolverhampton, highest soil Pb concentrations were associated with the industrial \ncorridor to the east of the city centre as expected based on land use (Fig. 3). In \ncontrast, sampling in the largely residential green suburban area of Richmond-on-\nThames, London revealed high soil Pb concentrations proximal to the road network. \nHowever, concentrations of Pb in surface soils from Richmond-on-Thames were \nhigher on average (median 185 mg\/kg) than Wolverhampton (median 101 mg\/kg), an \noutcome that would not be predicted from the historical land use records of the two \nurban areas alone (Kelly et al. 1996; Kelly 1997).  \nOn-going work in the Humber-Trent region of Eastern England is a further \nexample of the application of GSUE data to contaminant source identification in the \ncontext of rural and urban comparisons. During the summer of 1996, a soil \nF M Fordyce et al. 19\ngeochemical survey was undertaken in the City of Hull, comprising 411 individual \nsampling locations across 160 square kilometres. Based on a subset of the \nsurrounding G-BASE Humber-Trent rural survey data and the urban data from Hull, a \npreliminary surface soil geochemical map was generated for Sn over the region (Fig. \n12). The map highlights a series of anomalously high Sn concentrations around the \nsite of the former Capper Pass tin smelter, which was operational between 1937 and \n1991.  There is a clear trend of decreasing Sn concentrations at increasing distances \nfrom the smelter site, consistent with the dominant prevailing wind direction (from \nthe southwest). Further work is currently being undertaken in conjunction with local \nagencies to assess the nature, magnitude and extent of aerial metal deposition related \nto the former operation of the smelter. \nThe relationships between element concentrations and different land types \nhave been examined in more detail in Stoke-on-Trent (Fordyce & Ander 2003). Stoke \nis an interesting urban environment as the presence of coal, ironstone and clay in the \narea resulted in rapid growth during the Industrial Revolution (c. 1760 onwards) and \nthe city became a world-leading centre for coal, iron and steel and pottery \nmanufacture. As a result of this long industrial heritage, the majority of Stoke-on-\nTrent is built on urban fill and made ground material, much of which derived \nhistorically from industrial wastes. The types of made ground underlying the city had \nbeen mapped previously by the BGS (Wilson et al. 1992) allowing spatial \ncomparisons with the soil geochemical information. Investigations were carried out \nusing a combination of GIS spatial query function to select sub-sets of the \ngeochemical data over different types of made ground and data within 250 m of the \nroad and rail network followed by presentation as box and whisker plots (see for \nexample Fig. 13); three-component maps of multi-element distributions (Breward et \nF M Fordyce et al. 20\nal. 1992); Spearman Rank correlation matrices and principle component analysis \n(Fordyce & Ander 2003). The main element associations evident from these studies \nare outlined in Table 6.  \nInterestingly no overt geochemical signature with the road and rail network in \nStoke-on-Trent was apparent. Due to falling levels of traffic-derived Pb in urban \nenvironments as a result of the widespread use of lead-free petrol in recent years, \nMonaci & Bargagli (1997) and Monaci et al. (1999) have suggested that Ba is a good \nindicator of traffic fume contamination as it is added to diesel to reduce soot \nemissions (for example, Petkov et al. (1999). Elements such as Zn (used in tyres) are \nalso enhanced in the urban environment as a result of road vehicle usage. However, \nnone of these elements (Pb, Ba and Zn) showed an association with the road network \nin Stoke-on-Trent. Undoubtedly traffic fumes do contribute to the metal loadings of \nsoils in the city but the geochemical signature, as determined by the studies carried \nout to date, is not distinct because of the many other sources of these elements in this \ncomplex urban environment and naturally enhanced concentrations of elements such \nas Ba in the local bedrock (Fordyce & Ander 2003). \nIn general, the main control on element distributions in soils from Stoke-on-\nTrent is the presence of made ground. The majority of elements, with the exception of \nSiO2 and MgO, are elevated over made ground compared to the rural periphery. \nWithin the urban area, multi-element anomalies are associated with different \nindustrial land uses and made ground types aiding the identification of possible \ncontaminant sources. For example, As is enhanced in profile soils developed over \ndomestic and industrial waste and ironworks slag (Fig. 13). In general, soils \ndeveloped over coal spoil and coal ash waste are high in Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, K2O, \nAl2O3, SiO2, As, Hg, V, Ni, Cr, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ba and Pb whereas domestic waste soils \nF M Fordyce et al. 21\nalthough containing high trace metal concentrations, have lower major element \n(Al2O3, K2O, SiO2 TiO2) contents. Soils developed over ironworks slag and former \nsteel works sites have a distinctive geochemical signature, which is not only high in \ntrace metals (Fe2O3, Ni, Cr, Sn, Mo, Cd, V, Cu and Zn), but in base metals such as \nCaO, MgO and P2O5 reflecting the use of these products in the steel making process. \nThe use of pigments containing Cd, Cr, Cu, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, U and V and ceramic \nglazes containing SiO2, Al2O3, CaO, SnO2 PbO and FeTiO2 in the potteries industry in \nStoke-on-Trent account for localised anomalies due to historic factory emissions and \ndumping of ceramic waste.  \nInvestigations into element associations also demonstrate that the \nconcentrations of Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, MgO and Ba in Stoke-on-Trent soils are largely \ncontrolled by geological processes whereas CaO, P2O5, Pb, Cd, Cu, Co, Cd, Sn, Hg, \nMo, MnO, Sb, Zn reflect industrial activity and Cr, As, Ni, V, Fe2O3, K2O \ndistributions are partly controlled by the underlying geology and partly by \nanthropogenic inputs (Fordyce & Ander 2003).  \nThese results highlight the importance of a multi-element survey, which \ndetermines the major as well as the trace element components of soil as an aid to \ncontaminant source identification.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n1. The quality of urban land is of increasing concern in the UK and many other \ncountries as the need to reuse brownfield sites and regenerate city \nenvironments grows. However, information on the chemical and physical \nproperties of urban soils is often limited as historically these areas were \navoided by soil surveys. \nF M Fordyce et al. 22\n 2. Systematic multi-element urban geochemical surveys generate valuable \ninformation on the concentration, distribution, sources and likely mobility of \npotentially harmful elements in city environments providing an overview and \nframework to more detailed site investigations and can highlight areas for \nfurther follow-up in terms of contaminated land. \n \n3. To date, geochemical datasets for up to 48 parameters in urban soils have been \ngenerated for 21 cities in the UK by the GSUE project.  These data are of \ndirect relevance to a number of legislative drivers including the assessment of \nsources; pathways and risks to human receptors under the UK contaminated \nland regulations. The data also have application to the protection of water \nresources required by the EU Water Framework Directive and to soil quality \nsoon to be addressed by the proposed EU Soils Framework Directive.  \n \n4. The BGS is increasingly working with local authorities and environmental \nprotection agencies to develop the applications of the urban geochemical \ndatasets. Major gaps in information include data for Hg and organic \ncontaminants in the urban environment. It is anticipated that these will be \naddressed via end-user partnership arrangements in the future. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Director of the British Geological \nSurvey (NERC).
