Introduction \nTo be suitable for the construction of surgical prostheses, a bio-metal should possess several properties \nideal for bone and joint replacement. These are largely physical and mechanical features such as excellent \nfatigue and tensile strength, superior corrosion and wear resistance, low modulus of elasticity, good \nhardness and low density [1]. Titanium alloys are probably the most common materials used in surgical \nimplants and devices, and in recent years has become the bio-metal of choice in dentistry. \nThe orthopaedic and dental implant industry is based entirely on favourable interaction at the bone-\ntitanium interface \u2013 osseointegration. Moreover, it is clear that osseointegration is a property of titanium \nimplant surfaces. The surface modification of titanium implants is an active area of research for two \nreasons. The first reason is to increase the rate of successful implantation from satisfactory, as it is today, \nto excellent. The second is to induce acceleration of normal bone healing phenomena as this would allow \nearly of immediate loading of the implant, which would have significant implications in terms of \ndecreased patient morbidity, patient physicology and health care costs.  \nWhen titanium alloys are implanted into a complicated and aggressive physiological in vivo environment, \nthe oxide stability might be affected, resulting in an increase metal ion release [2-5]. In order to improve \nthe biocompatibility of titanium alloys, various surface treatments are carried out. According to Puleo and \nNanci [6], there are basically three different approaches to the surface modification of bone-contacting \ntitanium implants: physicochemical methods; morphological methods and biochemical methods. Of the \nthree, morphological methods are the most widely applied. This category includes techniques such as \nsandblasting and acid etching, and aims to direct interfacial interactions at the bone-titanium interface \nthrough the precise modification of surface topography. Biochemical methods of surface modification \noffer an alternative or supplement to physicochemical or morphological methods. Biochemical methods \nare intended to control the tissue-titanium interface through the immobilisation and\/or delivery of \nproteins, enzymes or peptides for the purpose of inducing specific cell and tissue responses. Whichever \napproach is adopted, cellular behaviour, namely adhesion, morphologic change, functional alteration, \nproliferation and differentiation are greatly affected by surface properties, such as roughness, chemical \ncomposition, wettability and morphology of the oxide on the titanium. Indeed, most of the surface \ntreatments are variants of surface machining, sand blasting or plasma spraying, all which have the \npotential to give rise to surface contamination.  \nDue to the rapid and specific modification of organic and inorganic materials, laser surface processing has \naroused growing interests and been proven to be a controllable and flexible technique for modifying the \nsurface properties of materials. It is recognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation \n 4 \nof material surfaces can affect their wettability characteristics. Previously Heitz et al [7], Henari and Blau \n[8], and Olfert et al [9] have found that excimer laser treatment of metals results in improved coating \nadhesion attributed to the fact that the excimer laser treatment resulted in a smoother surface and as such \nenhanced the action of wetting. It was demonstrated that five pulses per area of CO2 laser treatment was \nsufficient to produce a fully wettable mild steel surface. The wettability was influenced by the surface \nexposing time (SET) after laser treatment [10]. Self-fluxing Fe-Cr-Ni-B-Si alloy powders with various Ni \ncontents were laser clad on medium carbon steel substrates [11]. Lawrence and Li [12, 13] revealed that \nthe interaction of CO2, Nd:YAG, HPDL, and excimer laser radiation with the surface of selected metals \ngave rise to changes in the wettability characteristics of the material. It was observed that interaction of \nthe mild steel with Nd:YAG and HPDL radiation brought about an improvement in the wettability \ncharacteristics of the steel. Yet, despite a growing amount of work conducted with metal, no work has \nbeen conducted so far on the feasibility of the laser surface treatment process for the modification of the \nwettability characteristics of bio-grade metals.  \nIn the light of recent research by Hao et al [14], which demonstrated the feasibility of using a CO2 laser to \nalter the wettability characteristics and in turn, the biocompatibility, of a MgO-PSZ bioceramic, this work \naims to explain and analyse the factors responsible for modifications to the wettability characteristics of a \ntitanium alloy bio-metal following Nd:YAG laser treatment and to correlate these changes in terms of the \ncell response of human osteoblast cells. \n2. Experimental procedures \n2.1. Materials  \nIn this study a Ti6Al4V ELI alloy (F136) was used. The as-received Ti6Al4V alloy (ground annealed) \nwas in the form of round bar with a diameter of 28.5 mm (Carpenter, Inc.). For experimental purposes, \nthe round bar was divided into 16 sections each of 3 mm thickness with a cutting machine (Miniton; \nStruers, GmbH) using a diamond rimmed cutting blade and used as received prior to Nd:YAG laser \ntreatment. The 15 divided sections were then separated into two groups of eight samples, with the groups \nbeing: untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated.  \n2.2. Laser processing \nA 400 W Nd:YAG laser (MAHO, Ltd.) was used in this work. The Nd:YAG laser emitted a TEM00 beam \nat 1.064 \u00b5m and was operated in the pulsed mode. The defocused Nd:YAG laser beam was fired back and \nforth across the surfaces of the bio-metals by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam using the x- \nand y-axis of the computerised numerical control (CNC) gantry table. The laser energy density (fluence) \n 5 \nof the laser beam incident on the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy was set by fixing the power at 200 W and \nusing a beam spot size of 3.5 mm in diameter, while the traverse speed was fixed at 20 mm\/min.  \n2.3. Morphological, chemical and phase analysis \nThe surface roughness of the samples was measured by a surface profilometer (Surface Tester SV-600; \nMitutoyo, Inc.). The surface and cross-section characteristics of the untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated \nTi6Al4V samples were examined without etching using optical microscopy and scanning electron \nmicroscopy (SEM) (JSM 5600LV; JEOL, Ltd.). In order to determine any changes that may have \noccurred in the chemical make-up of the Ti6Al4V alloy following Nd:YAG laser treatment, the samples \nwere examined using energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) to obtain the chemical constituents and X-\nray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) to ascertain the elemental content. XPS (AXIS Ultra; Kratos, Inc.) \nanalysis was performed. Any changes in the phase of the Ti6Al4V alloy were detected by means of X-ray \ndiffraction (XRD) (PW 1830; Philips, Ltd.).  \n2.4. Wettability characteristics analysis \nTo investigate the effects of Nd:YAG laser radiation on the wetting and surface energy characteristics of \nthe Ti6Al4V alloy, wetting experiments were conducted. The experiments were comprised of control \nexperiments carried out using the sessile drop technique with a variety of control test liquids (human \nblood, human blood plasma, glycerol and 4-octanol) with known surface energy properties [27]. Thus it \nwas possible to quantify any surface energy changes in the Ti6Al4V alloy resulting from Nd:YAG laser \ninteraction. The experiments were conducted in normal atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 20\n0\nC. \nThe droplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy samples \n(untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the \ndrops being approximately 16.5 \u00b5l. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of \nthe sessile drops being obtained every minute. The contact angles, \u03b8, were then measured with a mean \nvalue being subsequently determined. The standard deviation due to experimental error was calculated as \nbeing \u00b10.340. \n2.5. Biological analysis \nThe human osteoblastic cell line hFOB 1.19 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection \n(Manassas, Inc.). These cells were cultured in a medium containing a 1:1 mixture Dulbecco\u2019s Modified \nEagle\u2019s medium without phenol red and Ham\u2019s F12 medium with 2.5 mM L-glutamine (D-MEM\/F-12 \nMedium), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (ATCC) and 0.3 mg\/ml G418 (Calbiochem, Inc.) \nin a 37\n0\nC, humidified, 5% CO2\/95% air incubator. \n 6 \nCytotoxicity tests consisted of the quantification of the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in culture \nmedium of cells in contact with the samples. The activity of the LDH enzyme rises when cells are \ndamaged: the LDH activity induced by the untreated and selected Nd:YAG laser treated specimens in \ntriplicate were compared to that induced by a toxic agent (Triton X100 0.05% in PBS) and to that induced \nby a culture polystyrene plate (NUNC, Inc.). The cell culture plate was used as a negative control and a \nTriton toxic agent as a positive control.  \nFor cell adhesion analysis, osteoblasts were enzymatically lifted from polystyrene tissue culture flasks \nuntil cell confluence using 1 ml Trypsin-EDTA (0.25% Trypsin\/0.53 mM EDTA Solution) before \nsuspension in the culture medium. The Ti6Al4V alloy samples were placed in a 24-well tissue culture \npolystyrene plate (Falcon, BP) under a sterile environment and sterilized in 70% ethanol for 24 h. The \nsamples were rinsed by PBS and then were seeded with cell suspension. To analyse the cell attachment \nand morphology, the untreated and laser treated specimens were seeded with 0.5 ml cell suspension of 1 x \n105 cell\/mL for 24 h cell culture, then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, critical point dried with CO2 \nand gold coated for SEM analysis. \nCell proliferation on each specimen was measured by MTT assay. The osteoblast cells culture 7 days on \neach specimen were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and were measured by MTT assay \nusing 3 (4,5-dimethyl-thiazole-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma, Inc.). The MTT \nsolution was added to each specimen and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37\n0\nC, then medium was \nreplaced with dimethylsulfoxide. Absorbance of the solution was measured with an instrument plate \nreader (EL312; Bio-Tek, Inc.) at 490 nm. \n2.6. Statistics \nStatistical analysis was performed with a SPSS v.12 software package (SPSS\/PC, Inc.). Data are reported \nas mean \u00b1 SD at a significance level of p<0.05. After having verified normal distribution and \nhomogeneity of variances, one-way ANOVA and Scheff\u00e9\u2019s post hoc multiple comparison tests were \ndone. \n3. Wettability characteristics modification following Nd:YAG laser treatment \nNd:YAG laser treatment of the Ti6Al4V alloy resulted in changes to the wettability characteristics of the \nmaterial. These modifications to the wettability characteristics manifested themselves in the form of \nvariations in the measured \u03b8 with selected control test liquids. Indeed, it was observed that for all the \ncontrol test liquids Nd:YAG laser treatment effected a reduction in the measured \u03b8. This reduction in \u03b8 \n 7 \nwas brought about by changes in the surface properties of the Ti6Al4V alloy, namely changes to the \nsurface roughness, the microstructure, phase, chemical composition and the surface energy. \n3.1. Surface roughness analysis \nIt was observed that for the Ti6Al4V alloy, Nd:YAG laser treatment actually caused the surface to be \nrougher, increasing from 0.21 to 0.45 \u00b5m. The observed increase in the wettability characteristics of the \nTi6Al4V alloy following Nd:YAG laser treatment is in agreement with the findings of Neumann [15]. In \nthis work, Neumann et al. developed a model similar to that for heterogeneous solid surfaces to account \nfor surface irregularities, being given by a rearrangement of Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n  \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3 \u03b8\nsl sv\nlv w\nr\n= \u2212\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\ncos\n (1) \nwhere, \u03b3sl is the surface energy at the solid-liquid interface, \u03b3sv is the surface energy at the solid-vapour \ninterface, \u03b3lv is the surface energy at the liquid-vapour interface, r is the roughness factor defined as the \nratio of the real and apparent surface areas and \u03b8w is the contact angle for the wetting of a rough surface. \nEq. (1) shows clearly that if the roughness factor, r, is large, that is the solid surface is rough, then \u03b3sl will \nbecome small. So according to the rearranged Young\u2019s equation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (2) \na reduction in \u03b8 will be realised by the liquid if \u03b8<900. Still, the increase in wettability characteristics \n(decrease in \u03b8) of the Ti6Al4V alloy following Nd:YAG laser treatment appears to be disproportionate to \nthe increase in surface roughness. Such an occurrence is quite possible because laser treatment inherently \nalters other factors besides surface roughness simultaneously, namely the surface chemistry (by way of \nsurface oxygen content) and the surface energy characteristics (by way of the microstructure). In this \ninstance, the fact that the wettability characteristics of the Ti6Al4V alloy increased after Nd:YAG laser \ntreatment indicates that these other factors played a part in governing the wettability characteristics of the \nbio-metal.  \n3.2. Microstructure, phase and chemical composition analysis \nSEM images of the Ti6Al4V alloy samples (see Fig. 1) showed that as the samples undergo Nd:YAG \nlaser surface treatment, melting and resolidification of the surface occurs. In this instance, it is clear from \nFig. 1 that the melting and solidification regime experienced by the Ti6Al4V alloy occasioned the \n 8 \nobserved increase in surface roughness. This observed increase in the surface roughness following \nresolidification indicates that the liquid Ti6Al4V alloy flow within the meltpool was turbulent.  \nThe results of an EDX analysis of the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy indicated that Nd:YAG laser \ntreatment did not alter that chemical composition of the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy since Ti, Al and V - \nthe basic elements of the Ti6Al4V alloy - were still present in similar proportions on the surface of the \nalloy before and after Nd:YAG laser treatment. Having said that, the XRD analysis (see Fig. 2) did reveal \nthat an oxide diffraction peak at 38.50 was generated after Nd:YAG laser treatment. This finding is \nevidence that the surface of Ti6Al4V alloy was oxidised following the Nd:YAG laser process, with the \noxide layer consisting of rutile. This is significant as many transient oxides may be formed on a Ti or Ti \nalloy surface, but only rutile or anatase are known to have a positive effect on biocompatibility. This \noxidation of the Ti6Al4V alloy samples came about because the surface was superficially melted by the \nNd:YAG laser beam during treatments. This in turn led to oxygen diffusion through the molten material \nand subsequently to the oxidation of the Ti6Al4V alloy surface.  \nAn XPS analysis of the untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy samples showed that the \nsurface oxygen content of the samples increased after Nd:YAG laser treatment, increasing from 25.04 to \n53.84wt%. It is postulated that this oxidation of the Ti6Al4V alloy surface following Nd:YAG laser \ntreatment was occasioned by the melting and resolidification regime experienced by the bio-metal. Since \nthe hydrophilic nature of the surface improves with increased oxygen content [16], then it would be valid \nto presume that the increase in oxygen content of the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy following Nd:YAG \nlaser treatment was an influential factor in occasioning the improved wetting performance of the material. \n3.3. Surface energy analysis \nThe intermolecular attraction that is responsible for surface energy results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [17]. The majority of these \nforces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total surface \nenergy, \u03b3, comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component; since van \nder Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, the surface \nenergy of any system can be described by [17] \n  \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (3) \nSimilarly, the total work of adhesion, Wad, can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular \nforces that act at the interface [17]: \n 9 \n   ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (4) \nwhere \nd\nadW  is the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, \np\nadW  is the polar component of the work \nof adhesion, \nd\nsv\u03b3  is the dispersive component of the surface energy at the solid-vapour interface, \u03b3 lv\nd\n is \nthe dispersive component of the surface energy at the liquid-vapour interface, \np\nsv\u03b3  is the polar component \nof the surface energy at the solid-vapour interface and \np\nlv\u03b3  is the polar component of the surface energy at \nthe liquid-vapour interface. \u03b8 for solid-liquid systems can be related to the surface energies of the \nrespective liquid and solid by \n   \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (5) \nIn accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [17] and Agathopoulos et al. [18], it is possible to \nestimate reasonably accurately the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n for the untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V \nalloy by plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv in accordance with Eq. (5), with the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n \nbeing estimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the \nintercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the abscissa at \ncos \u03b8 = 1. Fig. 3 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv for the untreated Nd:YAG laser \ntreated Ti6Al4V alloy-experimental control liquids system from which the values of \u03b3 sv\nd\n given in Table 2 \nwere deduced. \nIt can be seen clearly that the best-fit straight line for both the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy-liquid \nsystems intercept the ordinate higher above the origin than those of the untreated sample. This is of great \nimportance since interception of the ordinate close to the origin is characteristic of the dominance of \ndispersion forces acting at the Ti6Al4V alloy -liquid interfaces of the untreated samples, resulting in poor \nadhesion [17, 19]. On the other hand, an interception of the ordinate well above the origin is indicative of \nthe action of polar forces across the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, hence improved wettability \nand adhesion is promoted [17, 19]. Furthermore, because none of the best-fit straight lines intercept below \nthe origin, then it can be said that the development of an equilibrium film pressure of adsorbed vapour on \nthe Ti6Al4V alloy (untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated) did not occur [17, 19]. \nAgain, in accordance with studies conducted by Fowkes [17] and Agathopoulos et al. [18], it is not \npossible to determine \u03b3 sv\np\n for the untreated and Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy directly from Fig. 3. \n 10 \nThis is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)\n1\/2\n\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2 1 2\u03b3 \u03b3svp lvp\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus \nonly refers to individual control liquids and not the control liquid system as a whole; however, it has been \nestablished that the entire amount of the surface energies due to dispersion forces either of the solids or \nthe liquids are active in the wettability performance [17, 20]. As such, it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n using \n                ( ) ( )\n( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n1 3\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (6) \nFrom the best-fit straight line plots of Wad  against Wad\nd\n for the Ti6Al4V alloy when it is both untreated \nand Nd:YAG laser treated, it was possible to determine the value of the constant, a, for each separate \ncondition of the Ti6Al4V alloy. Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and Nd:YAG \nlaser treated Ti6Al4V alloy from Fig. 3, then it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and Nd:YAG \nlaser treated Ti6Al4V alloy using Eq. (6) (see Table 2).  \nAs one can see from Table 2, Nd:YAG laser treatment of the surface of the Ti6Al4V alloy brought about \na small increases in \u03b3 sv\np\n. It is believed that the change in \u03b3 sv\np\n is the result of the melting and \nresolidification of the Ti6Al4V alloy surface, which gave rise to a different, more polar microstructure. \nSuch an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n of the Ti6Al4V alloy will certainly have a positive effect upon the action of \nwetting and adhesion.  \n4. Biological analysis \n4.1. Cell cytotoxicity \nThe LDH activity in culture media obtained from cells cultured on all the tested materials was found to be \nnot significantly different from the negative control as shown in Fig. 4, indicating that untreated and CO2 \nlaser treated Ti6Al4V alloy were not cytotoxic.  \n4.2. Cell adhesion and morphology  \nGenerally, cells in contact with a material\u2019s surface will firstly attach, then adhere and finally spread. \nFrom Fig. 5 it is quite clear that the adhesion and spreading of osteoblast cells was influenced by the \nNd:YAG laser treatment. Whereas the cells on the untreated surface presents the initial stage of the \nadhesion with individual cells covering small surface area and not spreading, the cells on the Nd:YAG \nlaser treated sample exhibit a good state of adhesion and flattening to cover more surface area. This \n 11 \nsignifies that the cells achieved a better adhesion on the Nd:YAG laser treated sample than on the \nuntreated sample. This suggests that the surface properties generated by the Nd:YAG laser treatment were \nmore favourable for osteoblast cell adhesion.  \n4.3. Cell proliferation \nThe MTT results given in Fig. 6 show the cell proliferation on the surface of the untreated and Nd:YAG \nlaser treated Ti6Al4V alloy specimens for 7 days. It can be seen that the Nd:YAG laser treated samples \nallowed a significantly higher degree of cell proliferation as compared to the untreated sample. The \nstatistical analysis reveals that cell proliferation significantly improved on the Nd:YAG laser treated \nsample as compared with that on the untreated sample. These results reveal that the surface generated on \nthe Ti6Al4V alloy by the Nd:YAG laser treatment is more favourable for cell proliferation than the \nuntreated Ti6Al4V alloy surface.   \n5. Relationship between wettability characteristics and cell response \nFrom the foregoing results it is clear the Nd:YAG laser treatment of the Ti6Al4V alloy enhanced the \nwettability characteristics of the material and that following Nd:YAG laser treatment, the Ti6Al4V alloy \npresented improved bioactivity in terms of osteoblast cell adhesion and proliferation. It is not possible, \nhowever, to conclude from these findings that the increased osteoblast cell bioactivity of the Ti6Al4V \nalloy is correlated to the improvement of the wettability characteristics of the material. The reason that it \nis not possible to claim the existence of a correlation between wettability and osteoblast cell bioactivity \nfor the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy is that the Nd:YAG laser treatment resulted in the surface \nroughness of the Ti6Al4V alloy increasing. Since surface roughness is known to influence osteoblast cell \nadhesion and proliferation, it is possible that the surface roughness increase alone could be responsible for \nthe increased osteoblast cell bioactivity. So, for any correlation between wettability characteristics and \nosteoblast cell bioactivity for the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy to be confirmed or refuted, \nattention needs to be paid to the effects of increasing only the surface roughness of the Ti6Al4V alloy. \nThis was done by taking an untreated Ti6Al4V alloy sample and mechanically roughening the surface.  \nA mechanically roughened surface was obtained by evenly abrading the entire surface of the sample with \npolishing paper (180 grit SiC). This was achieved by applying the polishing paper to the surface of the \nsample with moderate pressure and drawing it across the surface in different directions eight-times. \nThereafter the morphological, chemical and phase properties were examined as in Section 2.3. Following \nthis the wettability characteristics of the mechanically roughened samples were quantified in accordance \nwith Section 2.4 and osteoblast cell bioactivity was assessed as in Section 2.5.  \n 12 \nA comparison of the MTT values for the untreated and mechanically roughened Ti6Al4V alloy samples \ngiven in Table 3 confirms that surface roughness does indeed affect osteoblast cell adhesion. As one can \nsee from Table 3, the MTT value on the Ti6Al4V alloy increased markedly from 0.070 to 0.081 when the \nsurface roughness was increased from 0.21 \u00b5m in the untreated condition to 0.52 \u00b5m by mechanical \nroughening. In addition, \u03b8 was observed to decrease from 41.84 to 36.39\n0\n, which is perhaps not surprising \nas surface roughness is known to be a factor influential in determining \u03b8, as demonstrated by Eqs (1) and \n(2). Significantly, Table 3 shows that the surface oxygen content and the \u03b3 sv\np\n of the sample subjected to \nmechanical roughening remained virtually the same as the untreated sample, thus indicating that the \ndecrease in \u03b8 and the increase in surface roughness alone caused the MTT value to increase. The MTT \nvalue for the Nd:YAG laser treated sample was considerably larger that of the mechanically roughened \nsample, 0.113 compared to 0.081, despite the slightly larger value of surface roughness on the \nmechanically roughened sample. Yet the surface oxygen content and the \u03b3 sv\np\n of the Nd:YAG laser treated \nsample were much higher. The value of \u03b8 was also found to be smaller by 5.45\n0\n. Since surface oxygen \ncontent and \u03b3 sv\np , along with surface roughness, have been shown to play a role in governing the \nwettability characteristics of a Ti6Al4V alloy following CO2 laser surface treatment [21], it is to be \nexpected that the Nd:YAG laser treated sample displays the lowest value of \u03b8.  \nOwing to the extensive body of literature attesting to the efficacy of surface roughness in enhancing \nbiocompatibility, it is clear that the increase in surface roughness of the Ti6Al4V alloy following \nNd:YAG laser treatment was responsible in part for the observed improvement in osteoblast cell \nbioactivity. Nevertheless, the wetting of a solid surface can be a predictive index of the biocompatibility \nof materials involved, so improvements in the wettability characteristics of the Ti6Al4V alloy would most \npossibly result in better biocompatibility. Indeed, a reduction in \u03b8 contributes to the enhancement in Wad \nof SBF and SBF+BSA on the Ti6Al4V alloy following Nd:YAG laser treatment. As both SBF and \nSBF+BSA have close chemical compositions to human body fluids, the improvements to the Wad of the \nTi6Al4V alloy surface towards these fluids would mean better suitability of the Ti6Al4V alloy as a \nbiomaterial after Nd:YAG laser treatment. Also, Hallab et al [22] demonstrated that surface free energy \nwas a more important surface characteristic than surface roughness for cellular adhesion strength and \nproliferation. Schakenraad et al [23] found that, despite the great number of parameters interfering with \ncellular adhesion and spreading, the solid surface energy apparently is a dominated factor in cellular \nattachment to a polymer surface and remains so, even if the solid surface has been covered by a protein \nlayer. Moreover, as discussed in the previously, the improvement of the wettability characteristics \nresulted in decrease of albumin adsorption and increase of fibronectin. The phenomena would be \nbeneficial to cell adhesion since albumin is a non-adhesive protein and fibronectin is an adhesion protein. \n 13 \nA previous study by Hao and Lawrence [24] also shows that the enhancement of the wettability \ncharacteristics of MgO-PSZ after CO2 laser treatment resulted in the better response of the human \nfibroblast cell and human osteoblast cell. The surface oxygen content of the Ti6Al4V alloy following \nNd:YAG laser irradiation is much higher than the untreated sample. The improved performance of cell \nadhesion and proliferation is highly likely to be due to the augmentation of the surface oxygen content. It \nhas been found that the biocompatibility of titanium implants is associated with the oxide on its surface \n[24]. The surface oxide layer on titanium is biocompatible and capable of interacting with surrounding \nbiological fluids and cells when implanted in situ [25, 26]. This layer, composed primarily of TiO2, is \nfound superficially on both cp Ti and Ti6Al4V alloys [25, 27]. Thus, it is reasonable to postulate that the \naspects of wettability characteristics: surface oxygen content and \u03b3 sv\np\n, play an important role in promoting \ncell proliferation, particularly when surface roughness is simultaneously increased.  \n7. Conclusions  \nIn this work a Nd:YAG laser was used to alter the surface properties of a titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) with a \nview to rendering the material more wettable and with enhanced bioactivity towards osteoblast cells. The \nspecific forms of cell response analysed were the cell adhesion and cell proliferation. In this way it was \npossible to determine the change in the degree of bioactivity of the Ti6Al4V alloy after Nd:YAG laser \ntreatment and relate this change to wettability characteristics modifications.  \nThe findings of this study revealed that Nd:YAG laser surface treatment could alter the surface properties \nof a titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) and thereby improve the wettability characteristics. Such improvements in \nthe wettability characteristics of the Ti6Al4V alloy were found to be due to: (i) an increase in the surface \nroughness; (ii) and increase in the surface oxygen content and (iii) an increase in the polar component of \nthe surface energy. From the cell response tests it was determined that the osteoblast cell adhesion and \nproliferation on the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy samples was considerably greater than on the \nuntreated samples.  \nBy introducing a mechanically roughened sample into the study, it was possible to isolate the effects of \nsurface roughness and thus confirm or refute the existence of a correlation between wettability \ncharacteristics and osteoblast cell bioactivity for the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy. The findings \nindicated that the aspects of wettability characteristics: surface oxygen content and polar component of \nthe surface energy played an important role in promoting cell proliferation, particularly when surface \nroughness was simultaneously increased. Consequently, it was possible to conclude that the wettability \ncharacteristics of the Nd:YAG laser treated Ti6Al4V alloy were correlated to osteoblast cell bioactivity. \n 14 \nAlso, it is evident from this work that Nd:YAG laser treatment could be a more effective way to improve \nosteoblast cell adhesion than the traditional methods currently available, especially mechanical \nroughening.   \nReferences \n1.
