Research into high reliability organisations (HRO) has\nshown that it is possible to avoid, trap and mitigate the risks inherent in complex socio-\ntechnical systems.

One such environment is the IS programme. By comparing and contrasting the\nsalient features of programme environments and HROs and presenting an in-depth case study\nwith two embedded units of analysis (two troubled IS programmes), we aim to contribute to\nthe ongoing debate about IS programme failure and to the theoretical development of\nprogramme reliability.\nKeywords: Programme Management, Project Management, Information Systems,\nResilience, High Reliability Organisation\nINTRODUCTION\nThe failure of large scale IS programmes has attracted considerable attention in the media. It\nappears that every year billions of pounds are wasted on new IS programmes such as the US\nAdvanced Automation System project (Nelson, 2007), or the UK National Offender\nManagement System implementation (National Audit Office, 2009). In 2004, only 29% of\nall IS programmes succeeded in meeting their time, budget and specification objectives\n(Johnson, 2006). The reasons for IS programme failure are manifold. Commentators have\nargued that the contributory factors include ineffective stakeholder management (Nelson,\n2007, Cerpa and Verner, 2009) and lack of commitment from business leaders and lack of\ncross-functional communication (Shehu and Akintoye, 2010). Increasingly, a concern has\nemerged that sole emphasis on achieving more from less, whilst initially laudable in itself,\ncan also contribute to mission failure in the medium term.\nReliable performance, like safety, shows itself only by the events that do not happen!\n(Hollnagel, 2006). Stability from this standpoint can be regarded as a \u2018dynamic non-event\u2019\n(Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001, p. 69), which is not involuntarily obtained, but has to be\naccomplished every day. Failure from this perspective, does not result from a singular failed\ncomponent or barrier, but occurs as a result of an inability to respond to unpredictable\nchanges in the context (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006, p. 14). It is the\u201cintrinsic ability of an\norganisation (system) to maintain or regain a dynamically stable state, which allows it to\ncontinue operations after a major mishap and\/or in the presence of a continuous stress\u201d\n(Woods and Hollnagel, 2006, p. 14). The primary purpose of this study is to explore how\nprogramme reliability can be achieved by keeping performance within a zone of acceptable\nvariance (Cleden, 2009) (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Programme Reliability\nStarting\npoint\nStability Instability\nTime\nNon\nsurvival\nPlanned\npathActual\npath\nSurvival\nThe established strategies for achieving reliability in volatile programme environments are\nformal structures, hierarchical decision making and adherence to plans, procedures and\nprocesses and the implementation of standardised risk management methodologies promoted\nby institutions such as the Project Management Institute and the Association of Project\nManagement (de Bakker et al., 2010). However, recent high profile failures of IS\nprogrammes suggest that there was no shortage of formal rules nor prior examples from\nwhich to learn. We find that an over-reliance on the structures and processes intended to\ncontrol programme risk and ensure stability, can generate outcomes that are unanticipated\nand suboptimal. Likewise, allowing members of the programme too much latitude for\ndeveloping and maintaining a repertoire of spontaneous and improvised responses to\nunpredictable or uncontrollable programme volatility may also lead to the escalation of\ncrises.\nIn order to provide a theoretical framework for our study we draw on the literatures on high\nreliability organisations, organisational resilience, and crisis management to help explore how\nfailures occur in complex systems and how some organisations have developed the ability to\navoid and mitigate them. Studies of HROs originally focused on the management of high\nrisk technologies but have begun to explore other situations where reliability is paramount\n(Roberts, 1990b, Rochlin, 1993). It has been argued elsewhere (Ivory and Alderman, 2005)\nthat research into HROs offers a compelling alternative and\/or expansion to the more\ntraditional, linear, deterministic approach to managing programmes. However, thus far,\nprogramme reliability has not been the subject of empirical inquiry.\nAdopting a processual perspective (Langley, 1999), we investigate the core characteristics of\nhigh reliability in two troubled IS programmes (embedded units of analysis) involving the\nsame client organisation, a Computer Service Provider (CSP) and two software development\norganisations (case study setting). All of the companies are well established in the IT\nindustry.\nIn what follows, we first consider the research on IS programme environments and consider\nthe extent to which there is a similar need for reliable performance to HROs. We then\nprovide a review of the literature on the core characteristics of HROs and derive our four\nresearch questions. We next introduce the setting for our research and the methods of data\ncollection and analysis. We then offer a thin description (Snook, 2000) of what happened\nacross the event sequence before using theory to help explain why events unfolded as they\ndid. In so doing we aim to contribute to the ongoing debate about IS programme failure and\nto the theoretical development of programme reliability.\nTHE CHANGING NATURE OF IS PROGRAMMES\nOrganisations are increasingly relying on information systems (IS) that are significantly more\ncomplex, dynamic and distributed than earlier technologies. The design, development and\nimplementation of IS within a defined scope, timeframe and cost has become ever more\nchallenging. As dependence on these technologies has grown, the nature of new IS\nimplementation has changed with the emphasis moving from single projects to the\ncoordination of multiple projects aligned to business objectives (Maylor et al., 2006, Evaristo\nand Van Fenema, 1999).\nProgrammes are a temporary form of organisation (e.g. Lundin and Soederholm, 1995,\nLundin and Steinthorsson, 2003), rather than just a scale-up of a project (Artto et al., 2009,\nLycett et al., 2004). Whereas a project can be defined as a predefined scope of work delivered\nusing existing capabilities to achieve agreed outputs in accordance with an authorised case, a\nprogramme is a dynamic collection of related projects and activities that, in combination,\nachieve agreed organisational objectives and emergent outcomes, including the creation of\ncapabilities (Lycett et al., 2004). Programmes are said to be adaptable to changes in the\nexternal environment (Thiry, 2002) but less capable of taking into account internal factors\nand conditions such as power dynamics and relationships (Lycett et al., 2004). With the focus\non strategic goals, programmes are a vehicle of organisational change, renewal and capability\ndevelopment. Examples range from information systems implementations (e.g. National\nAudit Office, 2009) to construction initiatives (National Audit Office, 2001).\nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE HIGH, RELIABLE\nPERFORMANCE\nWhilst there are clear differences across organisations and sectors, IS programmes and\nreliability seeking organisations (Koch, 1993), share three analogous challenges posed by\ntheir environments: the potential for significant loss, interactive complexity and competing\ngoals and interests.\nThe potential for significant loss\nOver the past twenty five years, research has been conducted in a large number of high\nreliability organisations that operate in high hazard environments but have far fewer \u2018errors\nthan one would expect, given the nature of its inherent hazards\u2019 (Rochlin, 1996) and they\nalmost never experience an operating failure of grievous consequences (LaPorte and\nConsolini, 1991). Studies originally included US Navy carrier aviation (e.g. Rochlin et al.,\n1987), the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s air traffic control operations (Schulman,\n1993b), commercial nuclear power plants (LaPorte and Lasher, 1988) and offshore platforms\n(Bea, 2002). As Weick and Sutcliffe (2001, p. 18) note, these HROs\n\u2018have a big incentive to contain the unexpected because when they fail to do so, the\nresults can be catastrophic. Lives can be lost, but so can assets, careers, reputations,\nlegitimacy, credibility, support, trust and goodwill\u2019.\nAny failure of these hazardous technologies is perceived by operators and the public to have\nsuch potentially grave consequences as to warrant their absolute avoidance.\nMore recently, researchers have explored HRO theory in other \u2018ordinary\u2019, low hazard\nenvironments (Zohar and Luria, 2003) that also present a need for reliable performance such\nas police (Roberts et al., 2008), healthcare (Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2007), train operations\n(Jeffcott et al., 2006) and railways (Busby, 2006), electricity provision (Roe and Schulman,\n2008), software firms (Vogus and Welbourne, 2003), banking (Roberts and Libuser, 1993),\nmicrocomputer firms (Eisenhardt, 1989b), and schools (Reynolds et al., 2006).\nThese environments differ from the contexts of the original HRO studies in two important\nways. Firstly, in some of these contexts cost of failure is grave, but not necessarily life\nthreatening. Secondly, managers often do not have command and control over the\norganisation\u2019s technical core (Roberts, 2009). However, these environments also suffer from\nadverse events that are \u201cphysical, cultural, and emotional event[s] incurring social loss\u201d\n(Vaughan, 1996, p. 292). The failure of IS programmes has the potential for significant\ndisruption, data loss, damage to reputation and may even jeopardise long-term business\nsurvival. Failures of IS programme events that have caught public and media attention have\nbeen widespread and have occurred in the private, public and voluntary sectors and in many\nindustries. While research has focused on major incidents, IS programme failures also occur\nfrequently beyond the public gaze.\nInteractive complexity\nReliability seeking organisations tend to operate in environments that are interactively\ncomplex (Perrow, 1984, Zohar and Luria, 2003). Interactive complexity increases when\noutcomes are unknown and potentially unexpected, socio-technical systems are multifaceted\nwith incompatible functions, and where information flow is indirect and ambiguous (Roberts,\n1990a). Interactive complexity is often associated with but does not necessarily co-exist with\ntight coupling (Schulman, 1993a). Tight coupling includes \u2018time dependent processes\u2019,\n\u2018invariant sequences of operations\u2019, \u2018the only way to reach the goal\u2019, and \u2018little slack\u2019\n(Roberts, 1990b). According to the Perrow (1984), failure is an \u2018inherent property\u2019 of\ninteractively complex and tightly coupled systems because they will inevitably experience\naccidents that cannot be foreseen or prevented. Perrow (1984) called these \u2018normal\naccidents\u2019. Environments such as extended construction or IS programmes requiring\nsignificant technology and infrastructure management have high levels of social and technical\ninteractivity. In these circumstances, people, complex technologies and physical assets\nbecome crucially interdependent. This tight coupling means that error in any particular\nprocess or activity can quickly cascade into more significant events and potentially lead to\ndestabilisation or failure of the whole, an effect which is especially relevant in non-repetitive\nprocesses such as programme design and management.\nCompeting goals and interests\nA focus on reliable performance is also essential when there are clear tensions between\ncompeting organisational goals such as production targets, and risk and safety goals (Leveson\net al., 2009) or a potential trade-off between thoroughness and efficiency (Hollnagel, 2006).\nPeople balancing multiple goals will tend to take greater risks (Woods and Hollnagel, 2006)\nand rarely have the courage to sacrifice production and efficiency goals when faced with\n\u2018warning signs\u2019 of impending problems (Woods, 2006). Thus,\n\u201cWhen organizations focus on today\u2019s profits without consideration of tomorrow\u2019s\nproblems, the likelihood of accidents increases\u201d (Roberts and Bea, 2001, p. 74).\nFor example, Vaughan (1996) reports that NASA was under heavy political pressure and in\ndanger of having its budget cut at the time of the ill-fated Challenger launch.\nAs programmes are temporary in nature, with people and organisations entering and leaving\nthe programme environment, achieving goal congruence between the parties involved in the\nprogramme, is particularly difficult to achieve. In programmes which often have elongated\ntimescales, an overemphasis on reducing costs in the design and inception phases can\nthreaten the quality of service provided and the viability of the programme in the long-term.\nProgrammes delivered over protracted timeframes create conditions where traditional lean\nmodels may prove too \u2018fragile\u2019 to be effective. Removing slack (dubbed waste) also limits\nflexibility in terms of \u2018space to experiment\u2019 and \u2018time to think\u2019 (Lawson, 2001, Lamming,\n1996) and this impedes organisational learning and performance improvement.\nSome organisations have developed the ability to operate effectively in volatile environments.\nThey have become known as high reliability organisations.\nTHE CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH RELIABILITY ORGANISATIONS\nLeveson, Durac and Marais (2009) argue that high reliability organisations exhibit four\nessential organisational characteristics.\nFirst, HROs prioritize both reliability and performance and consensus about the goals across\nthe organization (Leveson et al., 2009). HROs find an appropriate balance between both\nproductivity and safety goals (LaPorte and Consolini, 1991) and \u201cconsensus about these goals\nis unequivocal\u201d (Leveson et al., 2009, p. 239). HROs are said to have a preoccupation with\nfailure (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001), that enables them to remain sensitive to the possibility of\nfailure (Hollnagel, 2006). For Woods (2006, p. 29),\n\u201ceffective balance seems to arise when organisations shift from seeing safety as one\nof a set of goals to be measured (is it going up or down?) to considering safety as a\nbasic value\u201d.\nThis leads to our first research question:\nRQ1: To what extent do programmes find an appropriate balance and consensus\nbetween reliability and other performance goals (e.g. scope, timeframe and cost)?\nSecond, HROs promote a culture of reliability in simultaneously decentralized and\ncentralized operations (Leveson et al., 2009). HROs find a way for centralisation based at\nthe collective level to coexist with decentralisation at the individual level by exhibiting an\nadaptive, flexible or \u2018organic\u2019 nature (Weick et al., 1999).\nOur second research question is as follows:\nRQ2: To what extent do programmes reconcile the tension between the need for\ncentralisation (formal structures, hierarchical decision making and adherence to\nplans, procedures and processes) and the need for decentralisation (anticipation of\nproblems followed by rapid, improvised and mindful responses)?\nThird, HROs maximise the learning from accidents, incidents and near misses (Leveson et\nal., 2009). HROs believe that errors, incidents and near misses provide a potential for\nunderstanding. They tend to treat errors as windows that reveal the status and health of the\nsystem. People in HROs are reluctant to simplify explanations (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001),\nand are wary of interpreting information out of context. HROs are conscious of the labels,\nclich\u00e9s (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001) and categories (Langer, 1989) that can stop them from\nexploring events deeply. iven that the costs of failure are so high, learning from trial and error\nis impracticable; HROs compensate by using \u201cimagination, vicarious experiences, stories,\nsimulations, and other symbolic representations of technology and its effects\u201d as substitutes\n(Weick, 1987).\nOur third research question is:\nRQ3: To what extent is learning, particularly from errors, incidents and near misses,\nachieved in programmes?\nFourth, HROs make extensive use of redundancy (Leveson et al., 2009). Reserve capacity\nallows systems to cope with unexpected circumstances (Rochlin et al., 1987). Redundancy is\ndeveloped by duplicating technologies (e.g., backup computers) or people (e.g., more than\none person is capable of performing a critical task) (LaPorte and Consolini, 1991). Time is\nalso regarded as an important resource and slack is added to the decision making process,\nenabling actors to assess the effects of their decisions first, without affecting the overall\nsystem (Lawson, 2001). In this way, the potential consequences of faulty decisions may be\nunderstood before they actually escalate into major failure (Hollnagel et al., 2006).\nOur final research question is\nRQ4: To what extent is redundancy (e.g. technological, human and time) created,\nfostered and used in programmes?\nThis study aims to address these four questions by means of a case study with two embedded\nunits of analysis (troubled IS programmes).\nSETTING AND METHODS\nThe research methods comprise a single in-depth case study approach (Stake, 1995) with two\nembedded and linked units of analysis (IS programmes), underpinned by a processual\nperspective (Eisenhardt, 1989a, Pettigrew, 1990, Langley, 1999), paying attention to the\nprogramme context and sequence of critical events (Buchanan and Dawson, 2007). Process\nstudies of single case study organisations have become increasingly prominent in\nmanagement and organisation studies (Langley, 1999). For example, three Academy of\nManagement prize-winning papers were process studies based on archival data and\nretrospective interviewing (Isabella, 1990, Dutton and Dukerich, 1991, Plowman et al.,\n2007). With a single case, or a small number of cases, the aim is not to generalise from\nsample to population, but from experience and observation to theory through a process of\nanalytical refinement (Tsoukas, 2009) (also called analytical generalisation). As we are\nfocusing on specific IS programmes, we will seek themes that emerge from this case and then\ncompare them to the findings from the literature on programme management and high\nreliability organisations, as discussed above, in order to make more general propositions\nabout programme reliability in general.\nData elicitation\nThe two programmes chosen for this study (which, for purposes of anonymity, we have\nreferred to as Alpha and Beta) were both part of a major IT transformation for a Defence\nclient, whom we have called Def. Ltd, and had both experienced serious pressures. At the\ntime the study was carried out, the programmes were considerably over budget and delayed.\nThe data collected were both real time and retrospective. The study was initiated at the\ncritical period of \u2018Rescue and Salvage (see Figure 3) which was worthy of particular attention\nbecause this phase provided insights into the possible discontinuation of both programmes.\nBoth programmes involved were chosen for their strategic importance, i.e. the\nimplementation of a major information system which, if it failed, could even threaten the\nviability of the client.\nThe client for both programmes, is a major player in the Defence industry. As a main\ncontractor they used a Computer Service Provider (CSP) whom we have named All Inc.\nSolution. Typical services provided by this company include \u201cplanning, operation,\nimplementation and use of computer hardware, computer software and computer personnel\u201d\n(Howard, 2001, p. 2). Examples of programmes include \u201cRoll Outs\u201d and the implementation\nof \u201cUser Help Desk\u201d structures or \u201cOutsourcing\u201d programmes. In 2007 in the UK, such\nservices alone represented \u00a322.3 billion in turnover, having increased by 5.6% on 2006, for\nthe stand-alone CSPs of which approximately 50% of this service volume was delivered\nthrough programme work (Howard, 2001, p. 8). The strategic importance and costs involved\nin developing IT systems have raised the stakes associated with the programme outcomes\n(Keil, 1995).\nThe task of the CSP All Inc. Solution was to integrate a software solution on a hardware\nplatform. In the programmes Alpha and Beta, the development of the software solution was\ndone by two other CSPs subcontracted to All Inc. Solution; an organisation we have called\nDellsys in the case of Alpha. All companies are well established in the IT industry and have a\ntrack record of IS successes. All companies, including the client Def. Ltd are active\nworldwide and yet the results show that the integration between software and hardware may\nbe more challenging than expected.\nLangley (Langley, 2009) argues that the data sources for the examples of process research\ntypically comprise some or all of the \u201cbig three\u201d of qualitative research: observation\n(participant or non-participant), interviewing (retrospective or real-time; individual or group)\nand archival documents (internal or external; public or private). In total, 25 semi-structured\ninterviews were carried out with a 20 key stakeholders for each project. Most interviews took\nplace during the critical phase of Salvage and Rescue and some were repeated every 3 - 4\nmonths. They varied in duration between 1 and 3 hours depending on the amount of events\nand closeness to them.\nThe selection of the respondents was purposeful (see Table 1). First, individuals who were\nsingled out had the greatest in-depth knowledge about the two programmes; however, we\nmade sure that we questioned a variety of managers at different hierarchical levels who were\nspecialists or generalists in their field. Second, the retrospective examination of the phases\nbefore Salvage and Rescue required interviewing, for example, programme managers that are\nnow not actively involved any more in Alpha and Beta. It is interesting to note that most\nchanges to the hierarchy throughout the phases have been done at a programme management\nand project management level.\nTable 1: List of respondents in programmes Alpha and Beta\nOrganisation Alpha Beta\nDef Ltd. 1 x Account executive\n(interviewed twice)\n1 x Relationship manager 1 x Relationship manager\n1 x Programme manager\n(interviewed twice)\n1 x Programme manager\n(interviewed twice)\n1 x Programme Management Office director\n2 x Project manager 2 x Project manager\n(interviewed four\ntimes)\n1 x Project manager\n1 x Solution specialist 1 x Solution\nspecialist\n2 x Solutions specialist\nAll Inc Solutions 1 x Programme manager\n(interviewed twice)\n1 x Project manager 1 x Project manager\n1 x Solution specialist\nAll Inc-Subco 1 x Programme manager\nThe questions that were asked revolved around a key \u2018incidents\u2019 or \u2018events\u2019 or \u2018what\nhappened?\u2019 and followed questions on the impact, explanations of causes and whether\nanything was learnt from the event. The ladder of questions was extended to understand the\ntrigger that made the event possible and how programme resilience was affected.\nDocumentation such as risk logs, schedules and status reports were analysed and the results\ndiscussed with the participants. Information derived from document analysis was compared\nwith the findings from the interviews to gain insight into the phases, manner and content of\nmanagement in programmes.\nData derivation\nLangley (1999) proposes seven strategies for making sense of process data: narrative;\nquantification; alternate templates; grounded theory; visual mapping; temporal bracketing;\nand synthetic strategy. Our approach was to adopt a combination of three of these\napproaches. We developed a detailed story from the raw data (narrative strategy), produced\nseveral timelines and graphical displays (visual mapping) and decomposed the overall\nprogramme timelines into six successive periods (temporal bracketing) related to the phases\nof the Disaster Incubation Model (Turner, 1976): (1) starting point, (2) incubation period, (3)\nprecipitating event, (4) onset, (5) rescue and salvage, (6) full cultural readjustment (see\nFigure 1). The case studies were produced using a multi-methods approach, primarily\nqualitative, relying on a combination of semi-structured interviews and local documentation.\nThe result of the data elicitation phase was a mass of data that needed to be organised. Firstly,\nthe temporal decomposition into phases enabled an explicit view into the logical sequence of\nevents. Such decomposition of data enables the explicit examination of how action or\ninaction of one phase affects subsequent phases. Events, actions, feelings and other salient\nindicators were mapped at different hierarchical levels. For, example, the simplified extract in\nFigure 2 highlights not only the issue of lack of interaction during the incubation phase\nbetween All Inc. Solution and Def. Ltd but also within All Inc. Solution related simplification\nof concerns raised at an operational level.\nFigure 2: Simplified extract from process flowchart\nThese visual forms of interpretation have been shared with the participants in the study for\nthe purpose of validation. Predominantly defined as a data-driven approach, this method\nenabled us to derive findings that are helpful to examine programme reliability in a new light.\nThe findings are split into two parts. We first provide a brief thin description (Snook, 2000)\nof what happened across the six time periods before; secondly, we analyse the two\nprogrammes through the lens of HRO theory to help explain why events unfolded as they did,\nwhy decisions were taken, why changes have or have not occurred, and the consequences.\nFINDINGS\nThe starting point with Programme Alpha (see Figure 3) started in October 2006. The\ninvolved parties agreed on the systems requirements. All parties set out with the misguided\nassumption that the programme involved the straightforward implementation of an \u201coff the\nshelf\u201d product with the subcontractor Dellsys being in charge of the application and All Inc.\nSolution being responsible for the infrastructural platform. Def. Ltd defined their\nrequirements, while Dellsys evaluated the \u2018fitness\u2019 of the existing application. As it stood,\nthe system chosen for the programme Alpha was perceived not to require any further\ncustomisation.\nTa\nsk\nP\nro\nje\nct\nP\nro\ngr\nam\nm\ne\nE\nxe\ncu\ntiv\ne\nTa\nsk\nP\nro\nje\nct\nP\nro\ngr\nam\nm\ne\nE\nxe\ncu\ntiv\ne\nShortly after the contract was signed, Dellsys requested some customisation. In October\n2006, Dellsys determined that all the required customisation could be accommodated within\ntwo releases. However, the acceptance of the system was refused in May 2007. Dellsys\ncalled in an audit team to investigate the refusal by Def. Ltd. From that stage, the period of\nincubation was marked by an iterative cycle of patching, testing, raising issues and fixing\nthem.\nIn October 2007, awareness set in that management had lost sight of the development of\nAlpha. Cost and time overruns were the result. Another audit, this time a joint audit by Def.\nLtd\/Dellsys was carried out. Dellsys claimed not to be able to keep pace with the changing\nrequirements. As a result of the discrepancy, testing times were increased,\n\u201cSo that gives you an indication of what the domino effect was, that as soon as one\nslipped, it put more pressure on the next release, without actually changing any of the\ndates because politically, people had to hit the dates for the benefits case and you're\nnot allowed to fail in [Def. Ltd]. You're not allowed to say no.\u201d (Interview data)\nDuring the precipitating event, in March\/April 2008, ten months later than scheduled, a pilot\nand acceptance testing was carried out. In January 2009, the system went \u2018live\u2019.\nNevertheless, during onset, stability issues arose. In a period of rescue and salvage, 10\nweeks of \u2018fire fighting\u2019 were necessary to find a resolution to the stability problems. Despite\nthe delay and budget concerns, during full cultural readjustment members of the senior\nmanagement reframed the programme as a success:\n\u201cHave we delivered what we said we'd deliver? Yes. So, having got to the end of it,\nwe can say it's a success\u2026 Despite all the things that have caused us to be 35% over\nbudget and 50% over time-wise, we've delivered.\u201d (Interview data)\nAs a result of this reframing, at the end the data collection, relationships between\norganisations remained awkward, informants suggested that issues lay dormant, bugs and\nissues were left unresolved, and neither party had effectively made the full cultural\nreadjustments required to prevent recurrence.\nProgramme Beta followed a similar pattern (see Figure 3). In this case, the starting point\ninvolved the parties Def. Ltd, All Inc. Solution defining and committing themselves to\nsoftware and hardware specifications. Workshops to define the requirements of the\nprogramme in more detail were carried out in October 2006.\nJune 2007 saw the first release of the system Beta. Already at that stage, problems were\noccurring during incubation but signals that the programme was in trouble were missed,\nmasked and de-emphasised and, left unattended, these faults, errors and problems quickly\nescalated. The system did not run in a stable manner and functionalities did not materialise as\nexpected. Despite the initial setbacks, due to growing pressures to meet deadlines, the\nplanned times for launching further releases were not moved back \u2013 this was the precipitating\nevent.\nIn March 2009, during onset, a further release was implemented and went live. However, the\nproblems incurred by the previous releases added to the complexity of the entire non-\nperforming system and the programme team lost sight of how to overcome the increasing\nproblems with Beta. In March 2000 rescue and salvage was achieved by an external team of\nspecialists who were set up to carry out a high level audit on Beta and devise a suitable\nsolution to break the cycle of testing, patches and errors.\nIn 2009, Beta was considerably delayed and over budget. Once again, no cultural\nreadjustment occurred and the programme outcome was again described as a success. The\nprogramme manager argued:\n\u201cThe [Beta] programme Release D in itself, in my opinion, was a huge success in\nwhat we did because we're one of the only companies who's managed to do a four tier\nPLM architecture deployment on a global scale. Not many other companies, I\nbelieve, have managed to do it successfully.\u201d (Interview data)\nFigure 3: Timeline of programme Alpha and Beta\nStarting\npoint\nStability Instability\nSeptember 2006 February 2009\nJan 2007 Jan 2008 Jan 2009\nAlpha\nJanuary 2006 July 2009\nJan 2007 Jan 2008 Jan 2009\nBeta\nOct 2006\nCommitment\nto specifications\nFeb 2007\nCritical\ndesign\nreview\nMay 2007\nSolution is\ndelivered\nby main\ncontractor\nJun 2007\nAudit carried\nout\nAug 2007\nSolution is piloted;\noriginal \u2018Go-Live\u2019\ndate passed\nDec 2007\nAudit carried\nout\nMar 2008\nPilot and\nAcceptance testing\nJun 2008\nSystems does\nnot perform\nAug 2008\nProgramme evaluation;\nProgramme will be\ntwo years\nlate\nOct 2008\nSystem has not\nbeen fully tested;\nfurther concerns\nemerge\nJan 2009\nSystem goes live\nFeb 2009\nFurther performance\ntesting\nFeb 2006\nCommitment\nto specifications\nOct 2006\nWorkshops are\ncarried out to shape\nthe programme\nJun 2007\nRelease A\ngoes live\nOct 2007\nRelease B\ngoes live\nMar 2008\nOriginal date\nfor release D\npasses\nMar 2009\nRelease E\ngoes live\nMar 2009\n\u2018Tiger\u2019 team\nimplemented\nJun 2009\nPredicted launch\ndate for release E\nIncubation period Precipitatingevent Onset Rescue and salvage\nFull cultural\nadjustment\nIncubation period Precipitatingevent Onset Rescue and salvage\nFull cultural\nreadjustment\nIncubation period Precipitating event Onset Rescue and salvage Full culturalreadjustment\nCritical Events\nongoing\nongoing\nTime\nNon\nsurvival\nPlanned\npathActual\npath\nTo help explain the case, we now draw on the four primary aspects of High Reliability\nTheory outlined above. These are: identification and prioritisation of shared goals,\norganisational learning, simultaneous decentralised and centralised operations, and the use of\nredundancy.\nIdentification and prioritisation of shared goals\nIn both the programmes Alpha and Beta, the gateway review led to a definition of a business\ncase, in which requirements were defined and agreed upon. It was clear that all parties\ninvolved were over-confident and possibly complacent from the starting point:\n\u201cAnd indeed, they gave a commitment there that whatever customisation they did,\nthey would include it in their [off the shelf] product within two releases. So, on that\nbasis, we went forward with it.\u201d (Interview data)\nThe degree of faith and confidence in the guaranteed success of the programme was\nreinforced by many of the programme and account managers.\n\u201c\u2026 we\u2019ve had a long period of pretty successful SAP implementations and\ndeliveries, and we have generally been quite successful on timescale and cost over a\nten year period.\u201d\nDetermining the priority of goals in both programmes also revealed a confusing picture.\nSenior management at the client Def. Ltd emphasised that the primary goal of both\nprogrammes was to provide the end-user with an information system that was perceived to be\nuseful and easy to use. Yet, this perception was not shared:\n\u201cThere\u2019s pressure from [Def. Ltd] to keep the cost down at the start of the programme,\nand there\u2019s pressure from [Def. Ltd] to, you know, to deliver to a certain date.\u201d\n(Interview data)\nThe result of that pressure was the curtailing of testing times and the questioning of suppliers\u2019\nestimates of work packages by Def. Ltd (see redundancy). In some cases, the estimated\nresource requirements were downgraded to a level only to be accepted by Def. Ltd.\nThere was also significant pressure to hit deadlines. Due to previous delays in launching\n\u2018releases\u2019 of the information system, the importance of meeting original time commitments\nbecame more prevalent:\n\u201cLoads of additional work came in, but the date couldn't move. It had been\ncommunicated to the business. So we were up against\u2026 And the guys, the technical\nguys upstairs, just worked every weekend for, like, six weeks. They worked stupid\nhours. And we just said we'll focus on the build and get it in and the programme will\nhave to support it while we write up all the documentation afterwards.\u201d (Interview\ndata)\nDespite the increasing amount of problems that emerged, baselines were not moved.\nConsequently, first the workload increased. Second, greater risk taking that involved more\nand more issues (such as stability issues) were waived and \u201cno go decision was never really a\nno go.\u201d (Interview data) and supposedly error-free IS releases were launched:\n\u201cBecause they have political dates to hit. We must hit it or we'll go into the change\nfreeze, we'll lose the benefits case. I mean, as I say, I actually wrote five or six\nparagraphs on it, a saga, and the Chief of [Def. Ltd] just ignored it, as did my\ncounterpart, the programme manager that I faced off to. He just [said] \u2018thanks very\nmuch, we're buying off the risk\u2019, their decision.\u201d (Interview data)\nThird, not surprisingly, greater tensions arose between Def. Ltd and their suppliers:\n\u201cI had a huge fall out with the Chief of [Def. Ltd] in that Christmas and basically just\nsaid you're not listening to what the delivery team are telling you. You're still driving\nus to March, it's impossible. The plan we look at is talking about August\/September.\nWe don't have the resources, we don't have the skills, we don\u2019t have the time and we\ndon't have any testing in there. We have like two weeks testing, okay. So you're gonna\ngo live and this thing underpins all your business, and you're going to risk the\nbusiness with two weeks\u2019 testing.\u201d (Interview data)\nIn HROs there is a preoccupation with failure (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2001). However,\nrespondents were not aware of the importance of the programmes that they were working on\nand the possible costs of failure:\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the quantified impact is, to be honest. I would need to find that\nout.\u201d (Interview data)\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not 100% on what the business impact is but there will be one. This\nprogramme going live is a dependency for other programmes that I\u2019m aware of, so\nthey will also be impacted.\u201d (Interview data)\nIt is not surprising that balancing and achieving consensus on goals was difficult at first \u2013 key\nstakeholders in these programmes were not aware of the impact of failure. Second, the goal\nof a resilient information system was incongruent with efficiency measures. The erosion of\nthe goal of IS resilience was caused by past failure to meet deadlines and increasing pressure\nto reign in costs that were escalating due to the unexpected problems that emerged in a tightly\ncoupled system that those close to the programmes claimed to be a \u2018simple off the shelf\u2019\nimplementation.\nSimultaneous decentralised and centralised operations\nIn both Alpha and Beta, a strong top-down approach could be observed. Those who were\nconsidered close to the \u2018coal face\u2019 had little or no discretion to act. The capability of\nlocalised decision making was limited. Required changes often needed to be escalated to\nhigher authorities. Centralisation was also evidenced by the unchallenged compliance with\nthe rules and procedures imposed by Def. Ltd:\n\u201cSo, you know, for example, if we need to instal a new server into an existing server\nroom, connect it to the [Def. Ltd] network, there\u2019s no way that we would be able to\nbypass any of the processes that are replaced to protect that environment from\ncowboys like us coming along. So, you know, we must put in our request to make a\nchange to the production environment, you know, at least one week in advance of\ndoing it. We won\u2019t get that request granted unless we\u2019ve passed all the necessary\nprogramme phase quality gates before we get to that point. We must fill in our\nquestionnaires that go round to the 25 different stakeholders within the [All Inc.\nSolution] leverage team organisations, to get approval for our programme to proceed\nbeyond a certain point\u2026. not even your Theme Lead or your Programme Director in\nthe organisation has the authority to say, \u2018No, this is a royal train, we\u2019ll bypass all of\nthis,\u2019 it just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nThe ultimate decision to launch a release is taken by chief programming engineers. The\ndecision is influenced by systems engineers:\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to enforce the point that the final decision would rest with them but\nit\u2019s almost to the level where we\u2019re both making a decision because we\u2019ve given that\nrecommendation which, not forces, but strongly says, that this is the view to be\ntaken.\u201d (Interview data)\nNeither information systems specialists nor end-users alike have a \u2018veto\u2019 to prevent the\nlaunch of a release from happening,\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s [any point] trying to get too hung up on that point. We\nwould always give a strong recommendation, and it will never be a weak\nrecommendation. The point was just that, you know, we would try to promote one\noption which we feel is best.\u201d (Interview data)\nThe launch of releases in programmes Alpha and Beta were mainly driven by Def. Ltd, at\ntimes against the concerns raised by All Inc. Solution. Overall, the programmes appeared to\nbe top-down with lead times that did not do justice to the constant changes in the IS\ndevelopment. The \u2018launch\u2019 decision was highly centralised and hierarchical.\nOrganisational learning\nWeak signals of failure were evident throughout the period of incubation and programme risk\nmanagement procedures were in place to encourage learning about the unknown. However,\nmanagement of risk only appeared to confirm that the desired solution was \u2018simple\u2019:\n\u201cI assumed that Dellsys knew what they were doing.\u201d (Interview data)\nFurther, there was limited scanning and sensemaking (Weick, 2009) of the changing context\nby the programme team. Rather than critical reflection, deviations from the plan were\npassively downgraded, ignored or accepted:\n\u201cI think the way it was, was when we did the new plan to get the civil instance into\nproduction we raised a load of planning assumptions and risks around that schedule\nand they were bought off by [Def. Ltd]. Because the blind optimism of the [Def. Ltd]\nprogramme was that this will work, that the fact that they knew it was gonna be issues\nto them I was saying, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re going for a date operational readiness should be\nwhat it is, you are ready to go live.\u2019 It was not ready to go live and it was lucky it\nonly picked up five reds because it could have picked up six or seven if there\u2019d have\nbeen a less political sensitivity because it\u2019s a joint gate between [Def. Ltd] and [All\nInc. Solution] so it\u2019s [Def. Ltd] telling [Def. Ltd] to slow down and put all this testing\nin place.\u201d (Interview data)\nOverall, a blind faith in the competence of the providers prevailed. At no point did any senior\nmembers of the team question the core assumptions and premises of the programmes. The\nperformance of risk management exercises appears to have reinforced situational blindness\nand the status quo.\nProvision of redundancy\nIn the programmes Alpha and Beta, the ability to act locally if necessary is further\nconstrained by the availability of specialist resources. In the case where capacity is required\nto adapt to changes in the programme, lead times hamper the ability for immediate action\n(interview data). For efficiency gain, a leveraged model was applied in Alpha and Beta. The\naim was to fully utilise resources, in particular those that were critical to the success of the\nprogrammes:\n\u201cWhat we are doing is planning and resourcing and we want a plan that we think is\ngonna be deliverable because we need to give the resource groups a heads up on when\nthey need to supply their leverage staff, we need to do the resource levelling, we need\nto work out who we really need and if we haven\u2019t got enough then we\u2019ve got enough\nlead time in the plan to get those resources in from somewhere else; never happened.\u201d\n(Interview data)\nThe availability and planned access to resources was further limited by unwillingness to share\nthe burden of slack resources:\n\u201cAnd then, it's a case of but we're driven by being on time and materials contract and I\ncan't invest.... I wanted to bring a quality manager in, okay? Last year, I said to my\nmanager, can I bring a quality manager in to start, you know, being the policeman and\nmake sure we do the processes, that we do the right thing? Only if [Def. Ltd] fund it.\nWell can't that be our investment? Only if [Def. Ltd] fund it. [Def. Ltd], will you pay\nfor a quality manager?\u201d (Interview data)\nThe drive for lean programme management and the attention of efficiency measures left\nprogrammes Alpha and Beta in vulnerable positions. First, and in particular, specialist\nsoftware engineers were not available to form slack resources. Second, the volatility of the\nprogrammes seems not to have allowed a form of planning certainty that is necessary for a\nleveraged model to work. Third, the ambiguous distribution of the burden of using slack\nresources led to highlighting the competitive and blame led culture.\nTOWARDS A FRAMEWORK FOR PROGRAMME RELIABILITY\nOur case study has shown that the challenges presented by the high potential for loss,\ninteractive complexity, and competing goals and interests, were amplified in a rapidly\nchanging programme environment. In programmes, it is impossible to plan with certainty\n(Packendorff, 1995) as they are likely to unfold in unique, unpredictable and unexpected\nways (Cleden, 2009). Due to the interactive complexity of the programmes there were\n\u201cunfamiliar, unplanned, or unexpected sequences of activities that were not visible or\nimmediately comprehensible\u201d (Roe and Schulman, 2008, p. 53). The programmes moved\nfrom a state of relative stability to high volatility. High volatility is characterised by\nuncontrollable changes or unpredictable conditions (Roe and Schulman, 2008). This volatility\ncan be produced by factors, conditions and mechanisms that are internal or external to the\nprogramme. Our data also show that managers attempted to use a variety of strategies to\nachieve programme reliability.\nRoe and Schulman argue that reliability is achieved by, \u201cdeveloping and maintaining a\nrepertoire of responses and options in the face of unpredictable or controllable system\nvolatility\u201d (Roe and Schulman, 2008, p. 41). By building and further extending their\nframework, we argue that there are four approaches to achieving programme reliability (see\nFigure 4). According to Roe and Schulman (Roe and Schulman, 2008), reliability is also\nachieved by dynamically matching the contextual conditions with appropriate mechanisms\nand approaches. Problems occur when there is a mismatch between the strategy and the\ncircumstances or when the organisation has a preoccupation with one approach.\nFigure 4: Four approaches for achieving programme reliability\nProgramme Volatility\nLow High\nO\npt\nio\nns\nV\nar\nie\nty\nHigh\nContaining:\nAccomplishing\nReliability\nAdjusting:\nMaintaining\nReliability\nLow\nDeactivating:\nEnforcing\nReliability\nFire fighting:\nRestoring\nReliability\nContaining: accomplishing reliability\nWhen programme managers have multiple options at their disposal and the volatility inside\nand outside the programme is low, reliability can be achieved by means of control. Risk\nmanagement processes allow programme managers to identify and put in place strategies to\nameliorate potential risks. Slack is built into the programme in the form of technical backups,\nadditional actors, or space and time to consider options. During periods of relatively low\nvolatility, decision making can be centralised. Changes to specifications, however small, can\nbe \u2018signed off\u2019 by authority, and decision-making processes can be slow and thorough.\nCoordination is achieved through standardisation of a wide range of established policies,\nprocedures, processes and practices. Little communication is required across the members of\nthe organisations involved in the programme. In periods of low volatility, it is important to\nguard against overconfidence and complacency. Thus vigilant watchfulness (Roe and\nSchulman, 2008) is required to anticipate, surface and act upon early warning signs of\nchanging conditions.\nOur study shows that slack resource was hard to justify in programme environments. Both\nAlpha and Beta drew on a small pool of skilled people and embraced a fixed set of beliefs\nrelating to the need for \u2018lean\u2019 (meaning \u2018waste free\u2019) programme delivery. The result was\nstretched resources leading to a brittle programme environment. Through a process of\npractical drift (Snook, 2000) local action often departs from written procedure, creating\nloopholes in the system\u2019s defences. Our data showed that members of the programme also\ndeveloped a false impression of low system volatility from the outset, believing that the\nprogramme was a simple implementation of an off-the-shelf product. They also adhered to a\nreductionist model and approaches that oversimplified explanations, hindering the detection\nof a deteriorating performance. Weick and Sutcliffe (2001, p. 74) note that: \u2018With every\nproblem, someone somewhere sees it coming. But those people tend to be low rank, invisible,\nunauthorized, reluctant to speak up. In our study, weak signals of impending problems were\ndetected by people in the programmes but this information was not acted upon.\u2019\nAdjusting: maintaining reliability\nWhen volatility increases due to changes in programme or the external environment, rapid\nand flexible responses are required (Roe and Schulman, 2008). Reliability in this mode is\nachieved when timely action is taken and changes made before unforeseen incidents and\nevents become too costly. Cleden (2009) highlights the critical role of the programme\nmanager and members of the programme in achieving reliable performance by applying\n\u2018dynamic controls\u2019. Those with operational expertise are empowered to make quick decisions\nand take corrective action when unexpected situations arise (Weick and Sutcliffe, 2006).\nActors create new practices by inventing solutions with the resources available through\nbricolage (de Certeau, 1984). Coordination is achieved through people talking in real time\n(mutual adjustment) (Mintzberg, 1983).\nOur data show that reliability breaks down in this mode when repeated successful operations\nlead to the misconception that the application of \u2018fine-tuning\u2019 (Starbuck and Milliken, 1988)\nis working, thereby creating and reinforcing an \u2018illusion of stability\u2019, an erroneous belief that\nprogramme are under control (Butler and Gray, 2006, Cleden, 2009). This mode of reliability\nrequires communication of rich, real-time information about the health of the system and any\nanomalies or incidents (Weick, 1987). Achieving reliability in conditions of high volatility by\nmeans of adjustment was surprisingly absent in our study. Our data did reveal that cross\norganisational and cross functional communication in both Alpha and Beta was inaccurate,\ninsufficient and ambiguous.\nFire fighting: restoring reliability\nIn fire fighting mode, unpredictability and uncontrollability is high but the number of options\navailable to programme managers is low. Under these conditions \u201ceven small deviations in\nthe elements of the market, technology, or other factors in the system can ramify throughout\nthe system\u201d (Roe and Schulman, 2008, p. 46). In such settings it is crucial for everyone to\ntake responsibility \u2013 the buck stops everywhere \u2013 it is everyone\u2019s duty to intervene if they\nhave a concern, to stop errors escalating and prevent failure (Roberts, 1990a). Such\nsituations create high levels of anxiety and pressure. Weick and Sutcliffe (2001) demonstrate\nhow, in times of elevated stress or high error potential, expertise and experience is more\nhighly valued than rank in decision making. Under conditions of intense stress or high\nhazard operations, HROs exhibit elevated levels of collaboration and collegiality. Groups\nexhibit \u2018heedful interrelating\u2019 and \u2018collective mindfulness\u2019 (Weick and Roberts, 1993).\nWeick (1993) demonstrates that developing situational awareness and understanding are\ncritical. Rather than the linear strategic thinking evident in most programmes sensemaking\nrequires,\n\u201ccontextual rationality. It is built out of vague questions, muddy answers, and\nnegotiated agreements that attempt to reduce confusion.\" (Weick, 1993, p. 636)\nOur study shows that reliability can break down in this state when individuals are confused\nand unclear on the limits of autonomy and discretion. Heedfulness is also impeded when\nthere is a lack of trust, respect and honesty. In these situations people are inclined to diffuse\nresponsibility for action to others (Latan\u00e9 and Darley, 1970). Rather than technical risk\nmanagement systems, the key to reliability in situations of high volatility and low options is\nthe provision of support mechanisms to \u201chelp people cope with complexity under pressure to\nachieve success\u201d (Hollnagel et al., 2006). Our data show that these support mechanisms were\nnot evident in Alpha and Beta. The fire fighting, therefore, had consequences. Respondents\nreported high levels of personal stress, relationships between members of the programme\nteam were fraught and problems left unresolved.\nDeactivating: enforcing reliability\nIn the final state, high programme volatility is reduced by removing components, restricting\nor shutting down operations. Studies have shown that in high reliability organisations\nemployees are empowered to abort operations regardless of rank and are commended for\ntheir decision even if it turns out to be a false alarm. In extreme cases, reliability can also be\nenforced by an outside body such as a regulator. During this mode, predetermined crisis\nmanagement and business continuity processes are imposed to limit damage. Management in\nthis mode tends to be command and control. Extensive dialogue, negotiation and patience are\nrequired to overcome the potential tensions between the stakeholders to share the burden\n(costs) of enforcing reliability. Forms of relational contracting as practised in, for example,\nHeathrow\u2019s Terminal 5 programme (Gil, 2009), may be seen as a means of balancing and\nachieving agreement on seemingly incompatible interests in volatile environments.\nIn our study, neither Beta nor Alpha required the enforcement of reliability. However, it is\ninteresting to note that, like the engineers at Morton Thiokol in the ill-fated Challenger\ndisaster, technical experts in our study could only make a \u2018recommendation\u2019 (albeit a \u2018strong\u2019\nrecommendation) to abort operations but had no power to enforce deactivation.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBy comparing and contrasting the salient features of programme environments and HROs and\npresenting an in-depth case study with two embedded units of analysis (two troubled IS\nprogrammes), we have demonstrated that programme reliability is currently challenging to\naccomplish, sustain, restore and enforce in contexts where there is high potential for loss,\ninteractive complexity and competing goals and interests. To achieve programme reliability,\nfour key changes are required from all stakeholders: fostering programme reliability as a\nbasic value and a willingness to sacrifice short term efficiency and productivity goals to\nensure medium term mission delivery; enabling a decentralised system to coexist in a\ncentralised world; undertaking a deep and critical examination of weak signals and discrepant\nevents; and, finally, nurturing a readiness to invest in redundancy, even when these seemingly\n\u2018slack\u2019 resources are rarely utilised.\nThese general recommendations mirror existing literature on high reliability organisations,\nwhich tends to offer a singular set of organisational characteristics that are seemingly\napplicable to a broad range of contexts. Our study provides a more nuanced, contingency\nframework, suggesting that the strategies used to accomplish, sustain, restore or enforce\nprogramme reliability need to match the volatility in the programme environment. Volatility\nis the degree to which the programme faces uncontrollable changes or unpredictable\nconditions (Roe and Schulman, 2008). A mismatch between the strategies adopted and\nenvironmental conditions is likely to intensify rather than attenuate levels of adversity in\nprogrammes. Further, not only have we identified four different approaches to programme\nreliability but have also highlighted that, to be effective, each mode requires a different set of\nassumptions, practices, mechanisms and support structures.\nGiven the spate of IS programme failure, creating programme reliability arguably should\nconstitute a new and critical mission for the programme management community. Further,\ndeveloping the concept of programme reliability might help programme managers not only to\nbetter manage the unexpected but also use adversity as a springboard for high performance in\nthe future.\nREFERENCES\nARTTO, K., MARTINSUO, M., GEM\u00dcNDEN, H.
