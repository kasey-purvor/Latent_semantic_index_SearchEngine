The question of incorporating regular physical activity and exercise into\npeople\u2019s lifestyles has, therefore, become an important field of study. Given the complexity of\nphysical activity and exercise behaviour and the many factors that influence participation, to\nfind a single attribute that would be capable of predicting physical activity or exercise\nadoption, adherence, and resumption would be unlikely (Garcia & King, 1991). Motivation,\nhowever, has been shown to be a crucial personal factor that influences physical activity and\nexercise behaviour (Biddle, Fox, & Boutcher, 2000). For example, motivation is important for\ninitial adoption and subsequent adherence to medical as well as physical activity and exercise\nprograms (Annesi, 2002; Dishman, 2001; Ryan, Frederick, Lepes, Rubio & Sheldon, 1997). In\nthis respect, it has been suggested that there might be a general personality trait of self-\nmotivation, \u201ca non-specific tendency to persist in habitual behaviour regardless of extrinsic\nreinforcement and largely independent of situational influences\u201d (Dishman & Gettman, 1980,\np. 297). Dishman and Ickes (1981) developed an inventory measuring this first-order\npersonality trait. Research in the domain of exercise and physical activity has shown that the\nSelf-Motivation Inventory (SMI) is indicative of compliance to physical activity and exercise\nprograms, that is, increased levels of self-motivation reflecting lower attrition rates (Dishman\n& Gettman, 1980; Dishman & Ickes, 1981; Dishman, Ickes, & Morgan, 1980; Heiby,\nOnorator, & Sato, 1987; King et al., 1992; Robertson & Mutrie, 1989; Wilcox & Storandt,\n1996). Participants with high levels of self-motivation are believed to have appropriate self-\nregulating skills, set appropriate goals, provide their own reinforcement (Berger, Pargman, &\nWeinberg, 2002) and are able to maintain personal programs (Dishman & Steinhardt, 1988).\nSelf-motivation, therefore, would appear to be an important motivational factor that would not\nonly be able to discriminate between adherence and dropout but also between people\nengaging in exercise at different levels of intensity, frequency, and duration (Biddle & Mutrie,\n2001; Steinhardt & Young, 1992).\nAnother important distinction concerning motivation that has been successfully applied to the\nexercise domain is the self-determination approach (Chatzisarantis, Biddle, & Meek, 1997; Deci\n& Ryan, 1985; Ntoumanis, 2001). This theory postulates that any type of behaviour can be\nbroadly characterised as being intrinsically motivated, extrinsically motivated, or amotivated. In\nthe area of exercise, intrinsic motivation refers to activities in which individuals freely engage\nbecause they find them interesting and enjoyable. Three types of intrinsic motivation for exercise\nhave been described based on the work by Vallerand and colleagues (Vallerand et al., 1992).\nThese are intrinsic motivation to learn, to accomplish, and to experience stimulating sensations.\nThese three types of intrinsic motivation are viewed as self-determined forms of motivation. In\ncontrast, extrinsic motivation is evident when individuals perform an exercise activity because\nthey value its associated outcomes (e.g., public praise, improved physique) more than the\nactivity itself. Four types of extrinsic motivation for exercise have been described based on Deci\nand Ryan\u2019s (1985) conceptualisation. These are external regulation, introjected regulation,\nidentified regulation, and integrated regulation. Whereas both intrinsic motivation and extrinsic\nmotivation represent different degrees of volition, amotivation, the third type of behavioural\nregulation described by Deci and Ryan (1985), represents the absence of motivation.\nAmotivation is evident when one lacks the intention and willingness to engage in any exercise\nbehaviour. Research in the area of exercise has shown that self-determined types of motivation\n82\nRemco Polman, Willy Pieter, Luigi T. Bercades, & Nikos Ntoumanis\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 82\n(intrinsic motivation) are more likely to be associated with positive, adaptive behavioural\noutcomes, compared to less self-determined types. For example, Biddle, Soos, and\nChatzisarantis (1999) using a sample of over 700 Hungarian children aged 12-16 showed that\nphysical activity intentions were positively predicted by intrinsic motivation as well as identified\nregulation. Different types of motivation have also been related to actual behaviour. For\nexample, Ryan and colleagues (Ryan et al., 1997) using two independent samples of university\nexercise participants showed that long-term adherence to exercise was predicted by intrinsic\nmotives for exercise (i.e., enjoyment and competence), but not by extrinsic motives (i.e., fitness\nand appearance). Moreover, competence and interest\/enjoyment motives have been positively\ncorrelated with number of hours of weekly participation in physical activity, whereas body-\nrelated motivation has been negatively correlated with number of hours per week of\nparticipation, length of workouts, and perceived future participation (Frederick & Ryan, 1993).\nIntrinsically motivated forms of behaviour regulation, in this respect, are said to be particularly\ndesirable for adherence to physical activity and exercise whereas extrinsic motives are important\nfor exercise adoption (Ryan et al., 1997). One way of assessing levels of intrinsic motivation is\nby means of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) (McAuley, Duncan, & Tammen, 1989). The\nIMI measures four aspects of intrinsic motivation (interest\/enjoyment; perceived competence;\neffort\/importance; tension\/pressure) which are akin to the three types of intrinsic motivation\nidentified by Vallerand et al. (1992).\nWhereas the SMI is a general measure of persistence towards goals, not specific to exercise\nand physical activity, the IMI has been developed to specifically measure participants\u2019 levels of\nintrinsic motivation towards exercise and physical activity. The first aim of the present study was\nto investigate whether a general measure or specific measure of motivational orientation was\nbetter in describing the relationship between motivation and exercise behaviour in a\npopulation of Filipino students.\nIn addition to motivational issues it has been suggested that biological factors might also be\nimportant to adoption and adherence to physical activity and exercise participation (Dishman\net al., 1980). Wilfley and Brownell (1994) reported barriers among obese individuals that may\nimpede them from participating in physical activity or exercise, including previous negative\nexperiences (teasing, inferior performance, embarrassment, and feelings of inadequacy) as well\nas the physical burden of their excess weight, predisposing obese participants to experience\nphysical activity and exercise as more effortful and causing more discomfort. High levels of body\nfat and\/or excessive body weight at the start of a physical activity or exercise program have\nbeen shown to be predictive of later dropout (Dishman & Gettman, 1980; Dishman & Ickes,\n1981; Massie & Sheppard, 1971; Robertson & Mutrie, 1989). Furthermore, cross-sectional,\npopulation-based studies have consistently shown that body weight (Ballor & Keesey, 1991),\npercentage body fat (Duncan, Gordon, & Scott, 1991), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (Selby,\nNewman, & Quesenberry, 1990; Siedell, Bjorntorp, & Sjostrom, 1989) and body mass index\n(BMI) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996) have been inversely correlated\nwith self-reported physical activity and exercise behaviour. From the current literature it is not\nclear which body composition measure would be most useful in predicting exercise behaviour.\nRather than selecting one technique in favour of another in the present study the opportunity\nwas taken to compare the four most popular indirect methods of body composition assessment\n(body weight, BMI, WHR, body fat percentage) to physical activity and exercise behaviour.\n83\nPsychological and Biological Factors and Exercise\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 83\nFinally, few studies have systematically explored the interaction between body composition and\nmotivation on physical activity and exercise behaviours. Although the \u201cpsychobiological\u201d\napproach (Dishman et al., 1980) has intuitive appeal the few studies that investigated the\nrelationship between biological and psychological factors on physical activity and exercise\nbehaviour have shown mixed results. Furthermore, the studies that have been conducted in this\narea have mainly focused on the relationship between self-motivation, body composition, and\nexercise behaviour. Dishman et al. (1980), for example, found that compared to dropouts,\nadherers are leaner, lighter, and more self-motivated. However, Ward and Morgan (1984)\nfailed to replicate these findings. In their study, the psychobiological model successfully\npredicted adherence but failed to predict dropout. Biddle and Mutrie (2001) have recently\nsuggested that the discriminating power of the psychobiological model might depend on the\nlevel of exercise intensity. They suggest that high-intensity activities would require high levels of\nself-motivation and favourable physiological factors such as low levels of body fat, whereas\nthis might not be the case for habitual physical activity of an unstructured nature. Furthermore,\nBiddle and Mutrie (2001) suggest that self-motivation might be particularly important when\nfew extrinsic motivators are in evidence. The third objective of the present study, therefore, was\nto investigate the relationship between self-motivation and intrinsic motivation and body\ncomposition on physical activity and exercise behaviour in a sample of Filipino students.\nThe aim of the present study was threefold. Firstly, it investigated whether a general measure or\nspecific measure of intrinsic motivational orientation was better in describing the relationship\nbetween motivation and exercise and physical activity behaviour. Secondly, it examined the\nrelationship between the four most popular indirect methods of body composition assessment\nand physical activity and exercise patterns. Thirdly, the interaction between motivation and body\ncomposition on physical activity and exercise behaviour was explored. Based on the current\nliterature the present study predicted that exercise behaviour would be related to self-motivation\nand body composition measures, whereas physical activity patterns would not exhibit such a\nrelationship. That is, participants with higher level of exercise would score higher on self-\nmotivation and would exhibit favourable body composition measures. Furthermore, it was\nhypothesised that high levels of physical activity and exercise participation would be correlated\nwith higher levels of intrinsic motivation. This would be indexed by lower scores in tension-\npressure (Ward & Morgan, 1984) but higher scores in interest-enjoyment and competence\n(Frederick & Ryan, 1993). It was also expected that there would be gender differences in\nmotivational orientation as well as physical activity and exercise patterns. Women appear to be\nparticularly prone to appearance and fitness-related orientations in comparison to males\n(Frederick & Ryan, 1993; Silberstein, Striegel-Moore, Timko, & Rodin, 1988; Tappe, Duda, &\nMenges-Ehrnwald, 1990). These findings suggest that women are more extrinsically motivated\nthan men and possibly less intrinsically motivated towards exercise participation than men. Also,\nyounger age men tend to have higher exercise levels than females (Schoenborn, 1986).\nHowever, when physical activities are included in the determination of regular leisure time, this\ndifference in activity levels between gender is reduced or disappears (Stephens, Jacobs, &\nWhite, 1985). Thus males were predicted to exhibit higher levels of physical exercise whereas\nfemales would display higher levels of physical activity. Finally, it was expected that there would\nbe an inverse relationship between selected body composition measurements and physical\nactivity and exercise levels. That is, physically more active subjects would show lower body\nweight, BMI, WHR, and percentage body fat in comparison to less active subjects.\n84\nRemco Polman, Willy Pieter, Luigi T. Bercades, & Nikos Ntoumanis\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 84\nMETHOD\nPARTICIPANTS\nThe participants were 275 (112 males, 163 females) undergraduate students at the University\nof Asia and the Pacific, Manila, Philippines. This is a private University and the socio-economic\nbackground of the majority of students attending this University is middle to upper class. Age\nranged from 16 \u2013 28 years with a mean age of 17.85 years (SD \u00b1 1.18). Ethical approval for\nthe study was provided by the University and all participants signed an informed consent form\nat the start of the study.\nINSTRUMENTS\nIt should be noted that most Filipinos are bilingual in Filipino and English. All students at the\nUniversity have been educated in English at primary, secondary, and University level.\nTherefore, the instruments used were in the English language. Height was measured to the\nnearest 0.05 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Participants\u2019 weight was assessed using a\ncalibrated digital electronic scale. They were instructed to remove their shoes and to wear their\nnormal gym class clothing. Measurements were to the nearest 0.01 kilogram. Based on height\nand weight participants BMI was calculated (body mass divided by stature squared). Waist and\nhip circumferences were measured using a dressmaker\u2019s tape. Waist circumference was taken\nat the horizontal level between the xiphisternum and the umbilicus that yielded the minimum\nmeasurement. Hip circumference was the horizontal level around the buttocks posteriorly that\nyielded the maximum measurement. If duplicate readings differed by more than 2 cm, a third\nwas taken. The average of the duplicates or the closest two of the three measurements was\nsubsequently used to calculate the waist-hip circumference ratio. Slimguide skinfold calipers\nwere used by competent examiners to assess skinfold thicknesses at the tricipital and\nsubscapular sites. All measurements were taken on the right side of the body. Three\nmeasurements were taken at each site with the median being used as the score for analysis\n(note: the sites were marked using a pencil to ensure that all three readings were taken at the\nsame location). If the first two readings were the same, a third was not taken. Percentage body\nfat was calculated using the formulas put forward for male and female Japanese adults\n(Tsunenari et al., 1993). The validity and reliability of skinfold measurements for calculating\nbody fat percentage is dependent on technical skill, type of caliper, subject factors, and the\nprediction equation (Heyward & Stolarczyk, 1996). It is a suitable method for large scale cross-\nsectional investigations in which body fat percentage can be estimated with an accuracy of 3-\n4% (Lohman, 1981).\nThe SMI (Dishman & Ickes, 1981) is a 40-item questionnaire self-scored on a 5-point Likert\nscale ranging from \u201cextremely uncharacteristic of me\u201d to \u201cextremely characteristic of me\u201d. Of\nthe 40 items, 19 are positively and 21 negatively keyed. Possible scores range from 40-200.\nThe SMI has yielded a high index of internal consistency (r=0.91) as well as high test-retest\nreliability (r\u2019s ranging from 0.86 to 0.92) in research on physical activity and exercise\nbehaviour (Dishman & Ickes, 1981; Dishman et al., 1980). The IMI items are specially written\nfor easy adaptability to a variety of tasks and activities. The 18-item version of the IMI (McAuley\net al., 1989), in this study, was modified to assess the participants general intrinsic motivation\n85\nPsychological and Biological Factors and Exercise\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 85\nfor the class\/activity they were participating in. The instrument is scored on a 7-point Likert\nscale ranging from \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d and has four subscales:\ninterest\/enjoyment; perceived competence; effort\/importance; tension\/pressure. Coefficient\nalphas obtained for these four dimensions have indicated satisfactory reliability in the physical\nactivity and exercise domain (McAuley et al., 1989), however, its factorial validity has recently\nbeen questioned (Vallerand & Fortier, 1998).\nFinally, subjects were asked to rate their physical exercise and activity patterns. Energy\nexpenditure of the subjects was quantified based on a self-administered questionnaire\nassessing each type of activity with the amount of time (in minutes\/week) and intensity in units\nof METs (metabolic equivalents). Total energy costs were based on the activities incurred for\na week using the FitKid Physical Activity Questionnaire, a modified inventory based on the\none used in the Amsterdam Growth Study and the Paffenbarger Harvard Alumni\nQuestionnaire (Montoye, Kemper, Saris, & Washburn, 1996). Activities assessed the following\ncategories: (a) Physical education, (b) extracurricular,(c) organised physical activity, (d)\nregular exercise, (e) general physical activity, and (f) household chores. Total energy\nexpenditure as well as energy expenditure for exercise (a-d) and physical activity (e and f)\nwere calculated. Although this method is fairly crude and has obvious limitations, it was felt\nthe appropriate way for assessing physical activity and exercise patterns for the population\nunder investigation.\nPROCEDURE\nAll measurements were taken or administered at the start of a regular school semester to\nstudents who attended compulsory physical education classes. Body composition\nmeasurements were always taken first. Subjects were then instructed to complete the Intrinsic\nMotivation Inventory and Self-Motivation Inventory. Finally, subjects completed the FitKid\nPhysical Activity Questionnaire to measure their levels of exercise and physical activity.\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nFor 226 (90 males, 136 females) out of the 275 participants a complete data set was available\nregarding their physical activity and exercise behaviour patterns. An independent t-test was\nused to establish gender differences in their exercise and physical activity behaviour and for\ndifferences in intrinsic motivation. Hierarchical, multiple linear regression models were used\nfor the prediction of exercise and physical activity behaviour separately from the ordered entry\nof Self-motivation, followed by the four intrinsic motivation scales, followed by the four body\ncomposition measures, and finally gender was entered. Standardized regression (\u0002)\ncoefficients described the independent contribution of each predictor to the total regression\nmodels. Due to the a priory prediction that males and females would differ in their levels of\nexercise and physical activity the hierarchical multiple regression was also run for the males\nand females independently. Finally, Pearson coefficient correlations were calculated between\nthe body composition measurements and the physical activity, exercise, and total activity\npatterns for the males and females separately.\n86\nRemco Polman, Willy Pieter, Luigi T. Bercades, & Nikos Ntoumanis\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 86\nRESULTS\nThe internal consistency of the SMI and the four subscales of the IMI were first determined by\ncoefficient alpha (Cronbach, 1951). Internal consistency was found to be adequate for the SMI\nand the IMI subscales: SMI (\u0003 = 0.67); interest\/enjoyment (\u0003 = 0.78); perceived competence\n(\u0003 = 0.75); effort\/importance (\u0003 = 0.79); tension\/pressure (\u0003 = 0.62).

For the females, on the other hand, exercise was predicted by body weight and\nBMI whereas physical activity levels was predicted by the tension\/pressure subscale of the IMI.\nFinally, Pearson coefficient correlations did not show inverse relationships between the body\ncomposition measurements and physical activity and exercise for the males. With regard to the\nfemales, only a small significant positive correlation was found between body weight and\nexercise (r = 0.19) indicating that an increase in physical exercise was associated with an\nincrease in body weight for the females.\nDISCUSSION\nThe male participants in the present study exhibited, as expected, significantly higher levels\nof exercise and the females significantly higher physical activity levels. When physical activity\nand exercise levels were pooled together males had significantly higher total activity\npatterns in comparison to the females. This finding is in agreement with those obtained in\na similar US population - male students being more vigorously active in comparison to their\nfemale counterparts (Pratt, Macera, & Blanton, 1999). The present study\u2019s results suggest\nthat these observations are independent of culture and\/or ethnicity. There is a multitude of\nreasons for these differences in exercise levels of males and females. With regard to the\nFilipino population under investigation, it might be argued that the existence of traditional\ngender roles might impede females to take part in vigorous exercise (Johnson, 2000). This\ncould be due to a lack of sporting opportunities for women, including lack of women only\nsports clubs. The gender differences in exercise and physical activity levels suggest, however,\nthat both physical activity and exercise levels have to be taken into account when\ninvestigating physical activity\/ exercise behaviour of populations. In principle all forms of\nenergy expenditure can influence body composition and health. This could be achieved\nthrough a generally more active lifestyle as well as through vigorous exercise (Haskell,\n1994).\nThe present study also found that the general measure of self-motivation together with\nbody weight and percentage body fat were the best predictors of exercise behaviour for\nthe group as a whole thereby supporting the psychobiological approach. However, there\nwere some important gender differences. For the males, only self-motivation and for the\nfemales body weight and BMI predicted exercise behaviour. The finding that males\nshowed higher levels of exercise behaviour and that these were best predicted by self-\nmotivation would support the assertion put forward by Biddle and Mutrie (2001). They\nsuggested that activities that are of high intensity (higher metabolic demands) require\nhigher levels of self-motivation and a favourable body composition in order for\nparticipants to maintain these behaviours. Although the present study did not find any of\nthe body composition measures significantly contributing to the model for the males,\npercentage of body fat did, however, approach significance (p = 0.066). For the females,\non the other hand, higher levels of exercise were associated with increased body weight.\nSeveral cross-sectional population-based comparisons have, however, indicated that an\n90\nRemco Polman, Willy Pieter, Luigi T. Bercades, & Nikos Ntoumanis\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 90\ninverse relationship exists between body weight and self-reported exercise and\/or\nphysical activity levels (Ballor & Keesey, 1991; French et al., 1994). A possible\nexplanation for this finding might be the types of activities the females mainly participated\nin \u2013 swimming, tennis, and soccer \u2013 and environmental factors. Firstly, group or racket\nsports do not result in considerable weight changes depending on intensity, duration, and\nfrequency of exercise (French et al., 1994). Secondly, environmental factors have been\nshown to influence reported participation in exercise (Pratt et al., 1999). That is, a hot and\nhumid climate prevents people from exercising vigorously. In Metro Manila the weather is\nnot only hot and humid but is also accompanied by high pollution levels making vigorous\nexercise even more uncomfortable. Thirdly, the participants in this study were from a\nrelatively affluent background, many of them adopting a western lifestyle, which is\naccompanied by consumption of relatively high fat\/energy food. In general, a decrease\nin body weight (mostly fat weight) is only seen when exercise sessions are of long duration\nand high in intensity (DiPietro, Williamson, Caspersen, & Eaker, 1993). Fourthly, it has\nbeen shown that people have the tendency to over report their levels of exercise (ADNFS,\n1992). Thus, type of activities, environmental factors, and lifestyle resulting in relatively\nlow energy expenditure when exercising, a relatively high caloric intake, and the over\nreporting of exercise levels might explain the positive association between body weight\nand exercise for the Filipino females in this study.\nA possible limitation of the present study was that only levels of intrinsic motivation were\nassessed. However, it is believed that the intrinsic motives are most likely to result in positive\nbehavioural as well as affective outcomes (for example enjoyment and competence) and are\ntherefore critical for sustained physical activity and exercise (Ryan et al., 1997; Vallerand,\n2001). Extrinsic motives, on the other hand, have been viewed as an important trigger for the\nadoption of exercise (Ryan et al.). The results of the present study only found that the\ntension\/pressure subscale of the IMI was a predictor of levels of physical activity for the group\nas a whole and the females separately but not for the males. In this respect, the psychological\neffects of physical activity and exercise are well documented - participation in regular physical\nactivity and exercise being associated with a decrease in anxiety and depression and an\nincrease in general mood (Biddle et al., 2000). The lower levels in tension\/pressure associated\nwith higher levels of physical activity would support this notion. The differences found between\nthe genders in physical activity levels could be one explanation why the tension\/pressure\nsubscale was a predictor for the females but not the males. It could be suggested that a\nthreshold level of physical activity has to be attained in order to gain these psychological\nbenefits from physical activity. Or, on the other hand, for females these activities are more\nlikely to be perceived as a break from daily hassles in comparison to the males (Bahrke &\nMorgan, 1978).\nInterestingly, the scores obtained on the SMI for this study appeared to be fairly low in\ncomparison with scores obtained in other studies. Analysis of weighted means with unequal\nsample size was conducted to compare the SMI scores for the present Filipino sample with\nthose obtained in 9 studies conducted in western societies (see table 4). This analysis yielded\na highly significant main effect, F(9,1310) = 34.78, p < 0.001. Post-hoc comparisons showed\nthat the SMI scores of the present study were significantly lower than those found in any of the\nother studies (p < 0.05).\n91\nPsychological and Biological Factors and Exercise\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 91\nTable 4\nMeans, standard deviations, and number of subjects of studies which have used the SMI.\nStudy Mean SD N \nDishman et al.

Factors influencing such behaviours might be affected by ethnicity\nand\/or cultural differences. Considering the above findings, differences in motivational\norientation have been reported elsewhere in the literature. For example, Li, Harmer, Chi, and\nVongjaturapat (1996) found that goal orientations varied as a result of culture in their Thai\nsample. In this study, a positive relationship between task and ego orientation was found,\nwhereas no relationship would be expected in a Caucasian sample (Duda & Nicholls, 1992).\nKim (1995) has obtained a similar result in a Korean population. Although self-motivation\nscores were related to the participants exercise levels further research should establish if the\nSMI would be a valid scale to be used in societies with different ethnic\/cultural orientations. In\norder to do this, its functional, conceptual, and\/or psychometric equivalence have to be re-\nassessed (Duda & Hayashi, 1998).\nThe lack of inverse relationships between the selected body composition measures and\nexercise and physical activity levels was unexpected. It has been suggested, however, that\nphysical activity and exercise have less of an influence on body composition during younger\nage. Older people might benefit more from exercise and physical activity because of the\ndecline in muscle-to-fat ratio with age (DiPietro, 1995; DiPietro et al., 1993). Such an\nargument might explain the lack of association between body composition measures and\nexercise and physical activity behaviours. An additional issue is that the use of questionnaires,\n92\nRemco Polman, Willy Pieter, Luigi T. Bercades, & Nikos Ntoumanis\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 92\nalthough the most practical method for assessing energy expenditure, has some major\nlimitation; the validity and reliability, for example, are generally only moderate (see Melby, Ho,\n& Hill, 2000 for an overview). Another important issue has been the lack of data in the\nscientific literature on non-Caucasian populations. For example, the calculation of body fat\npercentage in this study was based on a formula derived from a sample of Japanese. No\nnormative data are available for Filipinos. This void in the scientific literature is unfortunate\nand more effort is required to establish criteria for people from different ethnic origin.\nIn conclusion, the psychobiological model was valid when predicting exercise behaviour for\nthe group as a whole. That is, self-motivation, body weight, and percentage body fat being\nthe best predictors of the participants level of exercise behaviour. However, there were some\nsignificant gender differences for the population under investigation. Self-motivation was a\nstrong predictor for exercise behaviour for the males whereas body weight and BMI were\npredictors for the females. Physical activity behaviour, on the other hand, was best predicted\nby the tension\/ pressure subscale of the IMI for the group as a whole and for the females but\nnot the males. This would suggest that the general first order personality trait of self-motivation\nwas better in predicting exercise behaviour, particularly for males and when executed at higher\nlevels. The latter could be achieved by exercising more frequently, for longer duration, or at\nhigher intensities. Self-motivation, in this respect, seems to be more important for activities that\ndo not result in immediate reinforcement (Dishman & Ickes, 1981). The tension\/pressure\nsubscale of the IMI was best in predicting physical activity behaviour, in particular that of the\nfemales. The data of the present study suggest that the psychobiological model might be more\nrelevant when dealing with participants who exercise at relatively high levels. Low levels of self-\nmotivation and possible unfavourable body composition (high fat percentage) being indicators\nof possible dropout. An important implication of the findings of the present study would be to\ntreat males and females differently when designing exercise and\/or physical activity\nintervention programs. Interventions for the males, for example, could be designed and\ntargeted to those participants low in self-motivation in particular when the activity is not likely\nto be intrinsically enjoyable and of high intensity, duration, and\/or frequency. For the females,\non the other hand, the selection of activities and the commitment and\/or involvement would\nbe important issues to monitor. Finally, there is a need for further research into the relationship\nbetween exercise and physical activity and body composition in different cultures. Ultimately,\nthese are related to health issues. For example, the epidemiological increase of diabetes\nmellitus in the Asia-Pacific region has been attributed to changes in lifestyle. In particular,\nchanges in dietary habits and exercise and physical activity have been found to be associated\nwith the development of (central) obesity in younger individuals in the Asian-Pacific region\n(Cockram, 2000). These issues are particularly important for the relatively affluent student\npopulation in the present study.\n93\nPsychological and Biological Factors and Exercise\nIJSEP\/doku\/March'04  08.01.2004  13:50 Uhr  Seite 93\nREFERENCES\nAllied Dunbar National Fitness Survey (1992).
