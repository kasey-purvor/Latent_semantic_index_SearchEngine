Metal nanoparticles and other metal\nnanostructures are the basic building blocks in photonics\nresearch4 and it is expected that magnetic nanoparticles will\nhave a dramatic impact on high density magnetic recording.5\nThe synthesis of nanosized noble metal particles has become\nan important branch of research due to their interesting\noptical,6 chemical,7 and electronic8 properties. For example,\nAg nanoparticles are of particular interest due to their\nsurface-enhanced Raman effect,9 which can increase the sen-\nsitivity of Raman measurements by orders of magnitude,\neven allowing single molecule detection. Typically nano-\nstructured silver substrates for surface-enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy \u0001SERS\u0002 are prepared by chemical means from\ncitrate reduced Ag colloids.10\nIn this letter we introduce a new method for producing\nsupported arrays of Ag nanoparticles, over large area, and at\nlow macroscopic temperatures. Once produced, we investi-\ngate the effectiveness of these arrays as substrates for per-\nforming SERS, by probing how the carbon bonding configu-\nration varies with film thickness for ultrathin amorphous\ncarbon11 \u0001a-C\u0002 coatings. High ratios of sp3 to sp2 bonded\ncarbon produces hard, wear resistant, tetrahedral amorphous\ncarbon \u0001ta-C\u0002 films, which are of considerable interest for\nmany applications including coating of hard disk platters.\nFor such applications, very thin ta-C coatings are required,\nbut how thin can they be deposited whilst still retaining their\ndiamond-like properties?\nAg thin films were deposited by pulsed laser ablation12\n\u0001PLA\u0002 of a 99.9% pure Ag foil. A Lambda-Physik LPX 210i\nexcimer laser, producing 25 ns pulses at 248 nm, was used\nfor the ablation. Thin films were producing using a laser\nfluence of \u000510 J \/cm2. The growth chamber was evacuated\nusing a turbo pump to 9\u000110\u22128 Torr. The substrates used\nwere SiO2\/Si with the thermal oxide having a thickness of\n235 nm. The target to substrate distance was 6 cm for all\ndepositions. Ag films were deposited with a thickness from\na\u0002Electronic mail: s.henley@eim.surrey.ac.uk\n0003-6951\/2006\/88\u00028\u0001\/081904\/3\/$23.00 88, 08190\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to5 to 20 nm, the growth rate being calibrated by profilometry.\nThe Ag films were excimer laser nanostructured \u0001ELN\u0002 using\nthe same excimer laser as employed for the deposition, by\ndiverting the optical path and passing it through a homoge-\nniser. This technique is discussed in more detail elsewhere.13\nThe films were transferred to a separate vacuum stage \u0001typi-\ncal working pressure 10\u22124 Torr\u0002 where the whole sample\ncould be laser annealed by translating the stage. The typical\ntranslation rate was 1 mm\/s with a laser repetition rate of\n10 Hz. This method has the advantage, compared to tradi-\ntional thermal annealing, that the majority of the laser energy\nis absorbed in the thin metal film, such that the substrate\nremains at low macroscopic temperatures. Postannealing the\nstructure of the films was investigated in a Hitachi S4000\nfield emission gun scanning electron microscope \u0001SEM\u0002.\nAfter morphological characterization of the substrates,\ntheir suitability for performing SERS measurements was in-\nvestigated by performing Raman spectroscopy measurements\nusing a Renishaw Ramanscope with 514 nm excitation. Thin\nta-C films were deposited onto the nanostructured Ag and the\nuntreated Ag films, by PLA in vacuum of a 99.99% pure\npyrolytic graphite target. Again, a fluence of \u000510 J \/cm2 was\nused for the ablation. For comparison ta-C films were also\ndeposited straight onto the SiO2 substrates. The ta-C film\nthickness was varied from 0.5 to 15 nm. The Raman spectra\nof these ultrathin diamondlike carbon \u0001DLC\u0002 film were ob-\ntained using 1% of the full laser output to minimise any\neffects of laser heating on the bonding configurations in the\nsamples and to avoid saturating the detector during SERS\nmeasurements. It should be noted, however, that no observ-\nable changes in the spectral shape was observed at higher\nlaser powers.\nFigure 1 shows SEM images of a 15 nm thick Ag film\nafter it was ELN at different fluences. At low fluences \u0003see\nFig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 the film is observed to perforate in some areas and\nbreakup into large droplets. As the laser fluence is increased\nthe whole irradiated area breaks up into near spherical drop-\nlets with diameters of around 150 nm \u0003see Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. A simi-\nlar breakup into droplets has been observed for the ELN of\nNi thin film.13 It should be noted that the liquid Ag is not\nexpected to wet the oxide surface.

At the highest fluences studied \u0003see\nFig. 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004 all the large droplets are gone and are replaced by\na high density of much smaller droplets. Statistical analysis\nof the Ag nanoparticle diameter distributions produced by\nthe ELN of Ag thin films, at fluences of 150\u2013600 mJ\/cm2,\nwas performed. From these distributions a shift of the distri-\nbution from a mean diameter of 144\u00b16 nm down to\n21.6\u00b10.5 nm was observed. The larger diameter droplets,\nproduced by hydrodynamic instabilities of the liquid metal\non the oxide surface, appear to be fragmenting as they boil to\nproduce many more smaller droplets. If the film is boiling\nand fragmenting, metal atoms should be lost into the vacuum\nduring the ELN. Figure 2 shows two SEM images of Ag\nfilms ELN at 400 mJ\/cm2. The initial film thickness was \u0001a\u0002\n5 and \u0001b\u0002 20 nm. The size and distribution of droplets is\nsimilar is both cases, indicating a considerable fraction of the\nmetal film must be being boiled away from the thicker film,\nand indeed, a coating of ablated metal is observed on the\nwindow of the ELN chamber after processing at these higher\nfluences.\nAfter laser processing of 15 nm thick Ag films at the\nhigher fluence \u0001\u0005400 mJ\/cm2\u0002 the film were converted into\nsupported arrays of Ag nanoparticles. These arrays were then\ncoated with thin ta-C coatings, of different thicknesses. The\nsuitability of these substrates for performing SERS was\nevaluated by taking visible Raman spectra of the ta-C films.\nHowever, before making these measurements the Raman\nspectra of the thin films deposited on bare SiO2 and unmodi-\nfied Ag thin films, was measured.\nThe inset in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 shows a visible Raman spectrum\nfor the 15 nm thick DLC film deposited onto SiO2\/Si, taken\nat a higher laser power and with a longer collection time than\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject tothe other spectra shown in Fig. 3. Typically the visible Ra-\nman spectra of a-C films are characterised as a combination\nof two bands, typically labeled the D and G band and are\nattributed to the breathing mode of aromatic rings and in-\nplane bond stretching of pairs of sp2 bonded C atoms,\nrespectively.14 For 514 nm excitation, the D band is typically\nlocated at 1335 cm\u22121 and the G band in the range\n1580\u00b120 cm\u22121. In order to characterize the films, the Raman\nspectra were fitted using a Breit-Wigner-Fano line for the G\nband and a Lorentzian for the D band.14 A linear background\ndue to photoluminescence was assumed. The solid line\nshown in the inset of Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 is a fit to the spectrum using\na Breit-Wigner-Fano line for the G band. No D band contri-\nbution was required to fit the spectrum, which is character-\nistic for as deposited ta-C films.14\nFigure 3 shows Raman spectra of ta-C films with thick-\nness \u0001a\u0002 15, \u0001b\u0002 2, and \u0001c\u0002 0.5 nm deposited onto different\nsubstrates. Spectra \u0001i\u0002, \u0001iv\u0002, and \u0001vii\u0002 are from films deposited\non ELN Ag, spectra \u0001ii\u0002 and \u0001v\u0002 on Ag thin films and spectra\n\u0001iii\u0002, \u0001vi\u0002, and \u0001viii\u0002 on \u201cbare\u201d SiO2 substrates. The spectral\nintensity measured from the thinner two ta-C films deposited\non bare SiO2 are too weak to resolve the D and G bands.\nHowever, a dramatic enhancement of the signal is observed\nin all cases for the films deposited on the Ag films and the\nELN Ag substrates. The enhancement factor \u0001defined as the\nratio of the integrated intensities of the Raman signal be-\ntween 1000 and 1800 cm\u22121, after subtraction of the linear\nbackground\u0002 is significantly greater for the ELN substrates,\ncompared with the Ag films, and decreases as the thickness\nof the ta-C coating increases. The maximum enhancement\nobserved, was by a factor of \u000580, for a 1 nm ta-C coating\ndeposited on ELN Ag.\nFinally, we consider the form of the Raman spectra ob-\ntained on the ELN Ag substrates, where in comparison to the\n15 nm thick film on SiO2 \u0003inset Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004, the D band con-\ntribution is more pronounced. The ratio of the intensities of\nthe D and G bands increases, as the thickness of the C coat-\ning is decreased. This change in relative intensities of the\nbands is typically associated with increased ordering of the\nsp2 bonded C phase, going from sp2 dimers in sp3 matrix to\nrings and chains of sp2 bonded C atoms.14 It is known that\nstress relaxation in ta-C forms a sp2 rich surface layer. As\nthese coatings were all deposited by PLA at the same laser\nfluence, but with different thickness, the changes in the spec-\ntra must be due to the relative contribution, to the total, of\nthe Raman signal from the bulk of the film. For thinner films,\nthe SER contribution from layers at the top or bottom sur-\nfaces becomes more important due to the top surface getting\ncloser to the Ag substrate and the signal from the bulk be-\ncoming smaller relative to the SER signal from the bottom\nsurface. The spectra indicate that, at these surfaces, the C\nbonding configuration is different from the bulk of the ta-C\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject toIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that UV pulsed la-\nser irradiation of silver thin films can be employed to pro-\nduce nanostructured Ag\/SiO2 substrates over large area, at\nlow macroscopic temperatures, suitable for performing\nSERS. This approach has the potential for broader usage as\nthe ELN mechanism can be applied to wide range of other\nsuitable metals, including Au, Pt, and Ni.15 This nanostruc-\nturing process could also have important applications in ca-\ntalysis and photonics. After laser nanostructuring, the films\nconsisted of discrete nanometer-scale near-spherical droplets.\nThese substrates were used to perform SERS measurements\non ultrathin ta-C coatings. An increase in the Raman signal\nof nearly two orders of magnitude was observed when using\nthese nanostructured substrates, allowing the detection of\nsubnanometer thicknesses of amorphous carbon. It was dem-\nonstrated that the carbon bonding configuration varied with\nfilm thickness, and the existence of softer interface layers at\nthe top and\/or bottom surfaces of the films is predicted,\nwhich has implications for the deposition of ultrathin\nscratch-resistant coatings. The ELN approach has advantages\nover traditional \u201cwet-chemical\u201d methods for producing nano-\nstructured metal surfaces. The process is compatible with\nvacuum microelectronics fabrication processes and can be\neasily patterned. Also the process can be used to produce\nnanoislands of different metals, on the same substrate, with\ndiameters that are readily controlled by just the laser param-\neters. All this means ELN will be important for future high-\ndensity lab-on-chip SERS applications where many different\ntests can be run on the same analyte.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nGrant and the Carbon Based Electronic Programme for\nfunding the project.
