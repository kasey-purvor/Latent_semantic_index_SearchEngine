This paper describes the mechanism of digital projection (creation of a \ndigital layer mirroring the physical world) by which the society digitizes. In the three-\nlayered leopard skin model of change described in this paper (physical layer, \nrepresentations and practice, institutions) , the physical layer (here, information \ntechnology) is changing much faster than the two other layers: representations and \ninstitutions. This situation calls for a new stand of social research in these evolutions, \nwhich is illustrated by the series of papers of this issue, summarized in this article. A \ncloser link to technology and different relation with stakeholders seem to emerge as a \nnew action-research approach in the field. \nR\u00e9sum\u00e9: La num\u00e9risation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pose une s\u00e9rie de questions urgentes aux sciences \nsociales. Ce papier d\u00e9crit le m\u00e9canisme de projection num\u00e9rique (cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une image \nnum\u00e9rique en miroir du monde r\u00e9el) par lequel la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se num\u00e9rise. Suivant le mod\u00e8le \ndu changement en peau de l\u00e9opard \u00e0 trois couches pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ici (couche physique, \nrepr\u00e9sentations et pratiques, institutions), la couche de l\u2019environnement physique (la \ntechnologie) change bien plus vite que la couche des repr\u00e9sentations et celle des \ninstitutions. Cette situation appelle un nouveau positionnement des sciences sociales dans \nl\u2019\u00e9volution soci\u00e9tale en cours, qui est illustr\u00e9e par les papiers rassembl\u00e9s dans ce num\u00e9ro, \nqui sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s dans cet article. Un nouveau courant de recherche-action semble \n\u00e9merger dans le domaine, en liaison \u00e9troite avec la technologie et les parties prenantes. \n \n2 \n3 \nThe story goes that when Andr\u00e9 Malraux, in August 1965, asked Zhou Enlai what he \nthought about the impact of the French revolution, the latter answered that \u201cit was too \nearly to tell\u201d1. We always tend to believe we live major changes in our own lifetime, but \nof course only history can tell; good analysis requires distance. Adopting this distanced, \ncritical attitude seems a commendable standpoint for Social Science: it is uneasy to grasp \nthe whole picture when one is still involved in the phenomenon. Taking part in the \nprocess as a scientist is a risky and dubious challenge, so why should academics get \ninvolved?  \nThis is a long-debated issue among philosophers and scientists. Today we must face it \nagain urgently with the so-called \u201cdigital revolution\u201d. Revolution or not, something big is \nhappening to societies with the diffusion of Cognitive Technologies (computers, sensors, \nsoftware, mobile communication devices, the Internet etc.), that is changing our everyday \nlives fast. What stand can Social Science take in this evolution? \nThis issue collects a selection of papers that were presented over the last two years in \ninternational symposia of the \u201cCognitive Technologies\u201d (\u201cTECOG\u201d) program2 at \nFondation Maison des Sciences de l\u2019Homme in Paris: \u201cDigital ethnography\u201d3, \n\u201cPerceiving and Being Perceived in digital environments\u201d4 ; \u201cGeolocation: psychological \nand social impacts\u201d5, and one in the webinar series that TECOG co-organized in 2006-\n2007 with the RUFAE6 network and CNRS-EHESS Center for Transdisciplinary Studies. \nWe launched the TECOG research program in 1998 at the Foundation Maison des \n                                                 \n1 Interestingly, on the Internet, this anecdote is most often quoted as a dialog in 1971 (or 1972) between Henri Kissinger \nand Mao Zedong (but also sometimes between Kissinger\/Malraux and Zhou, Ho-Chi-Minh, etc). So much for trusting the \nInternet as a source. \n2 This program is co-funded by EDF R&D and Foundation Maison des Sciences de l\u2019Homme, with the support of \nAssociation Fran\u00e7aise de la Recherche Cognitive. \n3 ; December 11, 2006, with Alain d\u2019Iribarne (FMSH); Saadi Lahlou (EDF R&D, Paris, FR);Christian Licoppe (ENST, \nParis, FR); Valery Nosulenko (Russian Academy of Sciences, RU) Yuri Alexandrov (Russian Academy of Sciences, RU); \nSiegfried Frey (Duisburg-Essen University, DE); Edwin Hutchins, Saeko Nomura and Jim Hollan (UC San Diego, USA), \nRoy Pea and Joe Rosen (Stanford University, USA). \n4 June 12, 2007, with Jean-Luc Lory (FMSH); Saadi Lahlou(EDF R&D, Paris); Roel Vertegaal (Queens University, CA) ; \nPaul Bach-y-Rita (University of Wisconsin, USA; Charles Lenay (Compi\u00e8gne University of Technology, FR); Ezequiel Di \nPaolo (University of Sussex, Brighton, UK (Valery Nosulenko, Russian Academy of Science, RU). \n5 November 12, 2007. with Alain D\u2019Iribarne  and Jean-Luc Lory (FMSH, Paris); Jun Rekimoto, (The University of Tokyo \/ \nSony Computer Science Laboratories, Inc., JP) Andy Crabtree (University of Nottingham, UK), Peter Joore, (TNO, \nEindhoven, NL),John Krumm, (Microsoft Research, Redmond, USA); Saadi Lahlou, (CNRS-EHESS, Paris, FR), Pierre \nNguyen (EDF R&D, FR); Aaron V.

Ten years later, a quick comparison of the state of \nthe art then and now will remind us the scale of the changes.  \n1 Looking ten years back \nTen years ago, Google (founded November 1998) did not exist. Now it processes 200 \nmillion queries a day. In 1998, there was no Wifi, no fiber, no DSL7, no power line \nnetwork, no Bluetooth, no Wimax, no GPRS. Today half of the population in Western \nEurope has high bandwidth access to the Internet, and Wifi network is becoming \nubiquitous. The possession of mobile phones grew sharply (in France, from 8.5% in 1997 \nto 84% in 2007), and Internet access too (for French households it was multiplied by \n100). There are 800 million Bluetooth devices worldwide (the system was launched in \n1998). E-bay (founded 1995) has 200 million users and over 7 billion dollars turnover. \nWikipedia (founded 2001) has 10 million articles, and 200 million visits per month, in \nmore than 250 languages. A flash memory card of 2 Gigabytes costs less than 10 Euros. \nToday\u2019s standard PC would have been in the world\u2019s top 500 ten years ago. 1.3 billion \nRFID tags were sold in 2006. And before the paper I write today will be even published, \nthese figures will be obsolete. E.g. today\u2019s forecast of sales for RFID tags are of 600 \nbillion in 2016.  \nThese technical figures go with deep changes in our everyday behavior. In France, 20% \nof the income tax declarations were done through the internet in 2007; a situation that was \nunthinkable 10 years ago. We can hardly live without the Internet and our cell phone. We \nspend about one hour out of four at work processing our emails. Our children\u2019s sociability \nis made of SMS, blogs, chats and instant messaging. We scientists are now familiars with \nwebinars, and PowerPoint presentation is almost compulsory in congresses (see \nBeaudouin, this issue). \nThis evolution has also deep impact on the world economy: information technology \nfostered globalization and the emergence of new finance and business models, corporate \ngovernance, labor division, etc. E-commerce is exploding. The economies of knowledge, \nof attention, are becoming a focus of interest and competition. Internet is now a major \n                                                 \n7 One of the authors in this issue, Beaudouin, supervised the social research on the first DSL high bandwidth field \nexperiments at France Telecom R&D in 1997. \n5 \nresource for scholars and education, information, and soon policies. \nThese are trivia. Now here is the issue. These systems are developed mostly \u201ctech-down\u201d, \nthat is by technologists and suppliers. Of course users seize the systems and try to adapt \nthose to their own needs and desires. But there is very little oversight of the emerging \neffects of these technologies, and when there is, it is hardly taken into account at design \nstage. Teenager sociability was not the main scope of the developers of instant messaging \ntechniques. A more worrying aspect of the current evolution is that it obviously brings a \nseries of social problems. We shall not discuss here the globalization issues, which do not \ncome from Information technology alone; but an issue like Privacy is obviously raised by \nthis new Information Society (and at least three papers in this issue address this problem). \nSuch social issues cannot be left to be dealt with by technologists alone. \nIn the last decade we saw the rise of interdisciplinary communities including social \nscientists who try to help the process of development of these Information and \nCommunication Technologies (ICT) technologies to make them more user-friendly, more \nreliable and secure. The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) hosts several. \nThese communities, which include with ICT experts mostly sociologists, ergonomists, \ncognitive scientists, anthropologists, linguists and psychologists, are often presented as \nthe \u201cHuman Factors\u201d side of the ICT research community. Not only did their work \ncontribute to the research effort in ICT, but it brought back from this field very interesting \ntheoretical and methodological insight from the analysis of interaction with computers \nwhich feeds social science in general. In this field have also been applied and developed \nnew approaches of action research and participative design involving users and \nstakeholders.  \nThe papers presented here are an advanced sample of how social science research can \ncontribute to the current evolution. One paper has a more neuroscience approach and \naims at clarifying an issue which becomes fundamental with the virtualization on the \ndigital world: how do we perceive the objects-of-the-world? Before describing the \ncontent of these papers, let us give, in the next two sections, a global vision to understand \nthe process of the digitization of society, and a theoretical framework analyze this cultural \nchange. \n2 The digital projection of society \nThe past ten years enabled us to validate a new grid, which allows to sort out substantive \n6 \ncurrents from surface effects. \u201cAutomation\u201d is the economic drive to the diffusion of IT; \nthe principle of \u201cdigital projection\u201d guides their technical implementation locally. We \nwill examine these two points in this section. Finally, the diffusion of this digital \nprojection follows a three-layered leopard skin pattern \u2013which we will see in the \nfollowing section. \n2.1 Automation.  \nThe development of productive structures goes through successive stages which follow \nthis automation principle: transferring human work toward specialized machines. For a \nwell defined repetitive task, a specifically designed agent is more cost-effective than \nunspecialized operators, such as humans. In the past industrial revolutions, physical \nhuman work had already been transferred to machinery. In current organizations most of \nthe human work had become tertiary (working with people, information, or machine \ninterface; but not directly transforming matter). \nInformation Technology (IT) has opened a new domain of automation for production: \ninformation processing. Henceforth, any repetitive task, including cognitive, which can \nbe explicitly modeled in the form of a procedure tends, in an economic process, to be \ntransferred to automatons. On this basis, all processes, particularly in the service sector, \nare currently being reviewed and optimized to take advantage of the new possibilities \noffered by IT.  \nThe automation of cognitive tasks is the economic drive for the diffusion of cognitive \ntechnologies. The automation of cognitive work remains partial though, because Humans \nremain the best operators for human relations, a task for which they are specialized by \nnature. The pressure to the economic rationalization leads first to computerize  the \n\"informational\" fractions of the activity. This is what we observe for example in the large \n\u201ccall centers\u201d where information processing is done by digital automatons (computers, \nprograms and the like), but where relation is still performed by humans.  \nIn this framework, the input of Human Sciences becomes crucial for system design. As \nLomov [1963, p. 23] stated: \u201c(\u2026) a man remains a man even when he enters the role of a \nlink in the control system\u201d. We need humans in the loop of complex systems since Man is \nmore plastic than machines with regard to information input, processing, execution, and is \nable to \u201cgrasp\u201d improbable events [Lomov, 1963, p. 21]. This is why \u201cthe greater the \ndevelopment of technology the more acute becomes the need for a detailed and thorough \n7 \nstudy of the peculiarities of Man\u201d [Lomov, p. 9].  \nTo predict future developments of the digitization of society, it is therefore necessary to \ndistinguish the \"relational work\" to which man is gradually relegated, from the \n\u201cinformational processing\" undergoing industrial transformation. How is this \ntransformation happening in practice? \n2.2 Digital projection \nThe process of this digitization follows the principle of \u201cdigital projection\u201d. Each \nindividual object or process of the actual World is assigned its own digital representation. \nThis digital image of the material world enables computing operations on objects in the \ndigital space (with workflows, programs, web-services\u2026). For example, the machines of \nan industrial plant, or financial flows of the various entities of the company, its customers \netc. are modeled, monitored and represented through computer interface to the Humans in \ncharge. The operations on those interfaces (acknowledgment, correction, command\u2026) \ntrigger the action of physical automatons. In the more mundane areas of life, where \neconomic pressure is less strong or inexistent, the drive for comfort and easiness brings a \nsimilar tendency for delegating to automatons various tasks (storing, searching, etc.). But \nthe creation of digital projections of everyday objects also brings new affordances (in \ngaming, creation, interpersonal relations) which create a demand of their own, therefore \nfueling demand. \nThe actual World\nDigital Projection\n \nFig. 1: The Digital Projection: a digital world mirroring the actual World. Each object of \nthe World has its representation in the digital world. \nThe structuring vision that we must have in mind is that of the gradual establishment of a \ndigital world mirroring the physical world (the \"digital projection\" of the physical world. \nIn the future, almost any object involved in a transaction will, eventually, have its \nprojection in the digital world (Fig. 1). \n8 \nWe are moving towards this new framework, it is already adopted by many service \ncompanies (bankinsurance, vehicle rental, etc.): A central database, digital representation \nof the organization operations domain (external and internal), is connected to functional \nworkflows, with workers overseeing relational interfaces with clients. Around this digital \nchannel is organized the production and activity of staff and customers.  \nThis affects functions as diverse as Customer Relation Management (CRM), human \nresources, procurement, logistics, reporting, planning, design\u2026 The digital projections \nare at present rather simple, and interconnections primitive. For example digital \nprojection of a client begins with a name, address, registration number, a means of \npayment. But projections are enriched quickly. After several years of CRM, digital \nprojection contains a customer's technical specifications, preferences, habits, his history \nof relation with the company, even data on his possessions, contracts, etc. \nIn summary: the automation principle guides the evolution of productive organizations. \nIT open new domains to automation, especially in the service sector. Automation happens \nby digital projection mirroring the material world. The digital world where transactions \nrun is now spreading rapidly in scope and precision.  \nWe can forecast that what shall prevail increasingly is not what is \"real\" in the physical \nworld, but its representation in the digital space, because there lies the register of \ntransactions, especially financial or legal. This shift will have important consequence on \nsociety. \nOf course, we are all ware of these changes, even if we may not share this vision of \ndigital projection. Now, what is the path of evolution to this digital society? At present, \nwe see many local changes, and at different levels: many new devices and services, some \nnew regulations, changes in behaviors, but the whole picture is yet far from clear. Can we \nget a better sense of the social logics of this change, if there is any? And can Social \nScience help us to monitor those changes; for a better world or at least to minimize the \nundesired effects? \n3 Changing societies: the three layered leopard skin \nGoing beyond mere description, critical analysis or modeling, actually using science in \ndesigning real-world systems is a tough reality test for any science. Among the problems \nimmediately encountered is the trans-disciplinary aspect of reality. A real system does not \nonly have social aspects, but also psychological, technical, economical etc. E.g. the \n9 \ncauses for the wide dissemination of ICT in the last decades are not only functional: the \nfact that, at identical cost every two years the power of electronic chips doubles while \ntheir size gets smaller (the so-called Moore\u2019s law) plays a major role. Hence, in \nexplanation, and in design as well, the researcher must take into account not only the \nhuman aspects but the technical aspects as well. Conversely, the technologist must \nconsider human factors. It is a well known fact among stakeholders in the domain that the \nmajor causes for success or failure of a new ICT system are \u201cnon-technical\u201d \n(understand: linked to user reception).  \nHere is a small simple model to clear things up, the triple-determination model.  \n3.1 Three layers of determination of human behavior \nAt a given moment, the World can be considered as an \u201cinstallation\u201d (in the artistic sense \nof assembling patterns in space to modify the way we experience this situation). This \ninstallation guides subjects into their activity track, at three levels: physical, mental, \ninstitutional.  \nThe physical level refers to material reality and artifacts; it provides affordances [Gibson, \n1967, 1982] for activity: which activities can be supported by the objects. For example, \nladders afford climbing; e-mail affords asynchronous text communication; houses afford \nshelter. This is the first level of determination. One can only do what is afforded by the \npresent environment.  \nAt human level, representations and practice provide possible interpretations of the \nsituation, and enable subjects to elaborate and plan behaviors. Mere affordances are not \nsufficient. This is the second level of determination: people can use mental \nrepresentations to interpret affordances into support for their activities. Jakob von \nUexk\u00fcll [1956] provides a famous example with ladders. He had come to Dar es Salaam \nwith a smart young African who had never been in town or seen a ladder in his life. When \nUexk\u00fcll showed him a ladder, the young man could only see \u201csticks and holes\u201d; but as \nsoon as he saw someone climbing the ladder, the artifact made sense to him, and he was \nable to climb too. \nRepresentations and objects follow a co-evolution process: representations are \nconstructed by the practice people have of objects. Conversely, objects are made after the \npattern of their representation: ladders are made to look like ladders; firemen are trained \nto behave as firemen; e-mail software are built after the representation of e-mail. And this \n10 \nis the reason why representations match with objects. So if we want new ICT systems to \nbe usable and sustainable, we have to work also on their representations among users and \ndesigners. \nAt a social level, the co-evolution of objects and representations is monitored by domain-\nlocal communities of interest (users, providers, public authority, etc.) who set the patterns \nof objects, the rules of practice etc. Because these stakeholders know the field, objects, \nrepresentations and rules are adapted to behaviors. These stakeholders create institutions, \nwhich are both sets of rules to be applied to keep order and cooperation, and communities \nof interest aware that they play in the same game. In this framework scientists have a \ncrucial role: they create new patterns of representation, make effects and trends explicit \nand understandable, set measurement and evaluation techniques, legitimize or criticize, \nand in general feed stakeholders and mass media with future visions and new ideas to \nmonitor the change. \nKnowing how to use the affordances is not always sufficient to execute adequate \nbehavior. Some people might do wrong and provoke (by ignorance, personal interest\u2026) \nnegative externalities for themselves or others. Institutions are a social answer: they \ncreate and enforce rules to control these potential misuses or abuses; they set common \nconventions which enable cooperation (e.g. people should all drive on the same side of \nthe road; they should use netiquette in their digital communication, etc.). Many of these \nrules are already contained in the mental representations, which are by nature normative. \nBut institutions bring a physical control layer to these norms. They enforce them with \nspecial personnel. Also, every loyal member of the community tends to serve as a rule-\nenforcer and bring back mavericks on track. Often these rules are made formal and \nexplicit (regulations, laws, etc.) but they may stay informal rules of good practice, tricks \nof the trade or traditions. As these rules are the result of compromise between local \ninterests, they vary from place to place. One only needs to look at the differences between \nregional architectures for concrete illustration. The fact that the rules are created and \nenforced by and between institutions which represent communities of interests, results in \nrules reflecting rapports de force between these communities, vested interests, and \ncurrent practice in the real world. The co-evolution between artifacts and representations \nis done under continuous monitoring and control of stakeholder communities, which use \ninstitutions as social and economics tools to safeguard their interests. This is one more \nfactor of stability of this normative framework. So much for this third, social, level of \n11 \ndetermination of behavior. \nThe resources and constraints provided at these three levels guide our social life and \nmake it possible and fluid. Subjects rely on them simultaneously and alternatively. They \nare compatible and somewhat redundant which makes this triple-determination system \npretty robust and stable.  \nThis triple determination explains how we behave at a given moment in time. This works \nbecause representations of objects match their actual shape and affordance, and because \nrules prescribe behaviors which are indeed feasible in the state-of-the art. Now, as stated \nearlier, this matching comes from a co-evolution between objects and representations; in \na chicken-and-egg continuous reconstruction and slow evolution.  \nFor our problem \u2013digitization of society- we must keep in mind these three levels to \nunderstand the evolution of the World. For example, to use an email, we must learn how \nto use the interface (representation level), and also learn the conversation rules that go \nwith it, finally we may need some instituted authority to refrain spammers.  \nEvolving towards a stable and sustainable state of the system means making changes at \nthree levels: physical (technical system ICT framework, from digital networks to software \nand business models); representational (the ideas people have of what \u201cliving in a digital \nsociety\u201d means); institutional (rules of good practice accepted and enforced by \nstakeholders of the domain). \n3.2 The three-layered leopard skin \nIn historical cultural change, evolution is slow, because it needs distributed changes, in \nall three levels. For our problem here, changes must take place in all the physical systems \n(in millions of individual homes and offices, networks, machines), new global supply \nchains and business models dealing with non-material goods and virtual services, the \nintroduction of new non-human actors in the social system (software agents, robots); the \nattitudes and practice of billions of individual and collective users, thousands of laws and \nregulations\u2026 This extensive aspect of the real World system is a challenge to general \ntheories because the field displays considerable local variation, so what may work here \nmay not apply there. And in each local point, the three layers must be coordinated so that \nphysical objects are consistent with representations and practice, and adequate institutions \nare set up to monitor and control the domain. This coupling of the three layers is the \nresult of complex negotiation between stakeholders, individuals, and the material \n12 \nenvironment; it takes into account many a local specificity. \nTherefore change in this complex and globalized system follows what could be described \nas a three layered leopard-skin process. This model differs from the simple geographical \ndiffusion, in that here diffusion may not only happen by geographical contiguity but by \nrebounds through the three layers that were described in the triple-determination model. \nThat is, local experiments create spots of change, which in some cases grow larger at \ncommunity level. Possibly, the whole system finally changes when these locally grown \nexperiments merge, or start being many enough to become the new norm. In this \nevolution, the role of institutions is absolutely crucial because they can actively \npropagate, reproduce or scale out a local innovation. Mass media (and Internet is one) is a \nnew fast vehicle for the dissemination of social representations and practice  \nIn this three-layered leopard skin model, the \u201cspots\u201d of innovation do not grow or spread \nin a steady and continuous manner, as water lilies covering a pond, but by complex \ninteraction inside and between the three layers, which interactions are often explained \nmostly by local, historical or accidental opportunities seized by motivated actors. For \nexample, the role of motivated individuals (techno-fans, evangelists, activists, enthusiast \nscientists etc.) in existing institutions often appears instrumental in seizing the windows \nof change to connect a layer to another and push their agenda. This distributed evolution \nmodel is difficult to understand, predict, and even more to monitor. \nOne main issue in the present ICT development is that the innovations are often \u201ctech-\ndown\u201d; the physical level is constructed first. But there are not yet institutionalized \necologies in these domains; or rather the previous institutions are not adapted because the \ndomain boundaries have changed fast and deeply. For example, the so-called \n\u201cconvergence\u201d of the media, content and communication economic clusters has not even \nstabilized that it is being questioned by a new convergence with the \u2018Internet of things\u201d \n(cf. Lahlou, this issue). So users \u2013and other stakeholders- are drowned in a mass of new \ndigital affordances before the representations and the rules of use are constructed. The \nnew affordances, by introducing novel forms of interaction, raise fundamental questions \nabout the very nature of relations between humans (cf. Lenay, this issue). Not only users \nare disoriented, but on the supply side actors are still seeking sustainable business models \nand try to construct new organizations and institutions. Designers combine technologies \nand install in our everyday environment new systems: emails, videoconferencing, blogs, \nthe Internet, but also networked sensors and robots, aware objects, etc. for which we do \n13 \nnot yet have clear representations or rules of the game.  \nSocial science has a major role to play in the construction of the mental and institutional \nlevel. Psychology tells us that individuals are often reluctant to influence; sociology that \nsocieties and institutions have some tendency to resist change. This is true and is in fact \nthe basic reason for which the world is livable: continuous change would only produce \nchaos. On the other hand, experience shows that when individuals are confronted to \nproblems they cannot solve with their usual routines (and especially when confronted \nwith novelty) they become more open to influence, and even eventually actively seek \ninfluence [Leppamaki & Lahlou, 2004]. This is also true of organizations: in fact a large \npart of the flourishing consulting business is based on this; so are many research \nprogrammes.  \nTherefore, if the digitization of society raises social issues, social scientists should get \ninvolved and propose solutions; otherwise solutions will be proposed by technologists \nmostly: Joore\u2019s paper in this issue shows precisely how this happens. \nThe Cognitive Technologies research program at Fondation Maison des Sciences de \nl\u2019Homme, where the papers collected here were presented, explored the potential \npsychological and social consequences of the digital revolution introduced by ICT, in an \nattempt to connect together the different layers of the leopard skin.  \nIt is a very diverse set of papers we have here, which reflects the diversity of issues raised \nin society by this technological wave. A common aspect of these papers is that they all \ninclude some part of technical description of the systems, because, as the reader will soon \nunderstand, they are a crucial aspect of the social problem. This display of technical \nproficiency in a non-social domain is somewhat unusual in social science (let alone \nstatistics), but when we deal with a hybrid word these concrete issues cannot be left aside. \nIn this sense these authors are representative of the current trend of social scientists in \n\u201cdigital ethnography\u201d who actually get involved in the design of socio-technical systems \nin order to understand from the inside how social reality is constructed by its \nstakeholders. They acknowledged that a first hand experience of the nature and properties \nof technical systems is of great help to understand how they shape their social use.  \n4 A grounded approach to ethical issues in the digital society \nThis issue collects seven papers. Three (Joore; Vertegaal & Shell; Lahlou). deal with the \naugmented environments and privacy issues caused by the digital projection of Humans \n14 \nand of their activity (position, attention, intention) In these papers the problem is how to \ncreate institutional rules considering the fact that the physical layer has changed as a fait \naccompli and now brings serious privacy threats. Two papers (Beaudouin, Pea et al.) deal \nwith the impact of digital tools (PowerPoint, and video) on the way we process \nknowledge. They focus on the relation between the physical layer and the representations \nand practice layer. Three papers (Nosulenko, Lenay; Alexandrov) deal with some \nfundamental aspects of digitization: what is an \u2018object\u2019 (Alexandrov, Nosulenko), what is \nan \u2018Other Subject\u2019 (Lenay): these issues are crucial to understand before we design a \ndigital projection. We shall see that Alexandrov and Lenay come with unexpected \nconclusions, and Nosulenko brings some constructive methodological propositions. \n4.1 An overview of the papers in this issue \nPeter Joore\u2019s paper on \u201cSocial aspects of location monitoring systems: the Guide Me and \nthe My-SOS case\u201d relates the design process of two new \u201clocation-based services\u201d \naiming at helping or protecting people.  \n\u201cMy SOS\u201d is a very small box with two buttons. One sends an alarm message including \nthe location of the device to a call centre. Pressing both buttons directly calls the Dutch \npolice. A speech connection is being opened. The help desk tracks the location of the \nperson and takes action when needed. This device, initially designed to prevent attacks on \nchildren, was also used in a security company for employees to carry in their rounds. \n\u201cGuide-me\u201d is technically similar, but designed to help family or caregivers locate \nAlzheimer patients in case they start wandering.  \nJoore raises on very concrete grounds social and ethical issues, regarding the tradeoff \nbetween safety and liberty. He shows how these ethical issues are closely connected with \ntechnical and design issues, e.g. whether the device signals the user when she is observed, \nthe precision of location, etc. His accounts show how power relations intervene; and how \ndiverse may be the attitudes of different stakeholders: some patients think they do not \nneed the device, while caretakers think it would be a good idea to implant it under the \nskin so that patients do not forget to wear it, or to implement electronic \u201cbarriers\u201d to limit \nthe patients errands (\u201cgeofencing\u201d). But Joore\u2019s analysis also uncovers unexpected issues \nraised by these new devices, namely the problem of a new responsibility for the watchers. \nE.g. the Guide Me device, while on one hand making caretakers\u2019 task easier, on the other \nhand creates a new continuous obligation and responsibility for them because of their \n15 \nawareness, finally making their work heavier.  \nPeter Joore\u2019s discussion, building on Bentham and Foucault, but also on interviews with \nusers, makes explicit the difficulty to create new rules and practice, as well as highlights \nhow dependent these social constructions are of minute and apparently benign technical \ndesign choices. His paper is prototypical because he shows that ITC concretely raises \nissues for which society has not yet found consensual answers; while the services he \ndescribes are already been launched on the market. \nIn the leopard skin model, we see how the three layers try to adapt to each other \n\u201cvertically\u201d on a local basis for the \u201cGuide me\u201d. We also see that the three layers for the \n\u201cGuide-me\u201d system cannot be transferred without modification to another local domain \n(for the security company or the elderly care), even if some features of the physical layer \n(the device) remain similar: this is precisely why the system must have three layers. \n \nRoel Vertegaal and Jeffrey S. Shell describe a new technique for making objects aware of \nhuman attention, by enabling them to identify the direction of human gaze. Their \ntechnology uses simple and affordable video cameras, by coupling them with the \nautomatic analysis of the reflection of infrared light on human eyes, to \u201cknow\u201d if human \neyes (whose pupils reflect infrared) are in sight, and whether they are or not looking at the \ncamera. With their paper, we understand how fare \u201caware\u201d environments are becoming a \nreality. Such attentive interfaces enable more natural communication with objects, since \nhumans can then address devices by looking at them. In other words, devices become \nable of eye-contact, a fundamental event in inter-subjective communication or reciprocal \nawareness and a crucial meta-signal in the management of turn-taking in conversation \nand inter-personal communication in general.  \nOf course this new affordance is of great added value for human machine \u2013and even \nhuman-human communication (Vertegaal et al. also made gaze-aware glasses which can \nsignal us whether we are looked at). The paper describes an experience where his system \nis used to customize work environments in order to support better communication or \nprivacy. Beyond this, these \u201cattentive user interfaces\u201d are capable to monitor human \nattention, which is now becoming a scarce resource and a commercial stake; and this \nraises a new series of issues. \nVertegaal and Shell discuss potential privacy implications in ubiquitous aware \n16 \nenvironments, and whether we could counterbalance surveillance with Steve Mann\u2019s \n\u201csousveillance\u201d notion, where the subject continuously monitors the environment that \nwatches him\/her. \n\u201cAttentive objects\u201d are obviously introducing a major change in our environment, since \nobjects which until now were thought as passive now become able of one of the most \nelaborate capacities of humans, namely to be aware of other\u2019s attention, especially in the \ncase of objects able to make eye-contact, as created by Vertegaal. It is still unknown what \nwill be the consequences of connecting these aware objects with the virtually unlimited \nmemory and reasoning capacity of networked computers. But here again, these \ntechnologies are already commercially available (I can testify, as we have some in our \nlab, among the multiple automatic tracking devices, biometric contactless authentication \nsystems and the like which we use to test augmented environments: once again, social \nscientists should be aware of what is already out there). \nIn the leopard skin model, typically we see here that the physical layer (the device) is in \nphase advance to the rest of the system. We also see that is necessary for designers to \nthink about the institutional aspects of their systems; and indeed so do Vertegaal and \nShell. \n \nAs Joore points out, designers mostly focus on the positive aspects of their systems and \ntend to neglect the potential social issues. Lahlou\u2019s paper addresses this issue by \nattempting to build guidelines for designers in order to make the ICT systems respectful \nof privacy. The question addressed here is what may happen to real humans as a result of \ndata mining in their digital projection. \nSaadi Lahlou\u2019s paper \u201cIdentity, Status, Privacy and Face-Keeping in Digital Society\u201d, \nstarts with providing the non-technical reader an overview of what the digital future will \nbe like, when what is presently at test stage in industry labs will be on the market, and \nshowing with some geolocation experiments how far these systems can reveal of intimate \nindividual activity. Ambient intelligence, by recording all events and transactions, \ncaptures behavioral trajectories which enable to be aware of present and past activity, but \nalso to some extent to predict what subjects will do in the next moments. His account of \nKrumm\u2019s work (protection by encryption, pseudonymy and other computer techniques, \ncan usually be overcome with state-of-the art algorithms) shows that solutions cannot be \n17 \nonly at the technical level: mental attitude and institutions must change also. His \npresentation of the privacy dilemma suggests that the core reason of the privacy problems \nlays in the social nature of transactions: one needs to disclose personal elements to \nperform successful relation. \nThe paper proposes a new definition of privacy as \u201cface keeping\u201d. We all have many \nfaces (combinations of role and status), but each one is used only in some settings. \nPrivacy breach, Lahlou argues, is being presented with a \u201cwrong\u201d face, one that is not \nconsistent with the situation (e.g. be seen at work in a family role). Systems should \nsupport users to wear exactly the face they want to show in the domain at hand (and \nnothing more: \u201cprivacy razor\u201d).  \nThis perspective is constructive in that it gives a positive goal to designers: tailoring the \nsystem to a very specific set of roles and statuses for the user; instead of vague \ninstructions for avoiding potential problem. The paper includes in annex the complete set \nof European Privacy Design Guidelines by Lahlou & Jegou [2003], which were built \nupon this psycho-social analysis. This is an attempt to answer the question of the role of \nsocial scientists: feeding the institutions and the communities of interest with usable \nguidelines for their activity. \nICT changes the practice of formal communication, in science and in business. Valerie \nBeaudouin\u2019s paper \u201cPowerPoint, speech and text: Procustes\u2019 bed revisited\u201d studies one of \nthe most remarkable evolution which occurred in the last ten years and blew up hundreds \nof years of rhetorical tradition. In 2001, according to Yates and Orlikowski [2006], 95% \nof public oral presentations were equipped with PowerPoint; a tool that did not even exist \ntwo decades before. This brings deep change in the nature and content of discourse. \nBeaudouin traces the historical evolution of the presentation format, from pure oral \ndiscourse, to read aloud written discourse, to discourse with graphic aids, and presently \ncomputed supported discourse with memory aids (PowerPoints) shared on the network. \nShe lists the classic critics: PowerPoint decks are a Procustean \u201ccompromise\u201d between \nlong argumentative texts and short memory cues. Most often, intelligibility is lost because \nof the lack of global structure and because the hierarchy & list format forced by the \nsoftware tends to destroy logical links and argumentation; while during presentation the \ntext on the slides often distracts the audience. \nBeaudouin goes further based on her series of ethnographic observation of presentations \n18 \nand conferences. She shows how PowerPoint presentations disorient the audience when \nthere is no alignment between the speaker, his talk, and the slides. This typically happens \nwhen slides contain lots of text; which is the case when slides are also intended to stay as \na written document for the audience, and not only as aides to the discourse. This is a \nproblem since one reason for using PowerPoint, on the production side (for speakers) is \nprecisely that the same support will be used as aide and report, therefore saving the \nburden to write a text. \nBeaudouin proposes a new hypothesis for the growing use of PowerPoint, based on the \neconomics of attention. In a context of strong pressure to produce many presentations, \nPowerPoint \u201cdecks\u201d make it easier for the presenters to prepare (by assembling and \ncustomizing old slides) and present (using the slides as a memory aide). On the demand \nside, for a public engaged in multiple tasks during the presentation, PowerPoint enables \nfloating attention and re-synchronizing with the presentation.  \nBeyond this discussion on the reciprocal influence of format and institutional constraints, \nBeaudouin shows how much PowerPoint decks are difficult to interpret in the absence of \nthe accompanying contents. She therefore warns that, as PowerPoint decks are \nincreasingly replacing texts, this may create long term problems with knowledge \nconstruction and corporate memory.  \nIn the leopard skin, we have here a good example of the co-evolution of tools and \npractice, and on their institutional consequences. Beaudouin\u2019s warning to organizations \nand communities (business and scientific) is also a call for them to adapt their rules in \norder to prevent to possible unwanted consequences of the change in progress. \n \nICT changes the practice of business and science. This aspect of digital science is also \nvisible in the paper by Roy Pea, Robb Lindgren and Joseph Rosen: \u201cCognitive \ntechnologies for establishing, sharing and comparing perspectives on video over \ncomputer networks\u201d. Pea et al. address the issue of how cognitive technologies \u201cshape \nwho we are by re-organizing our activity systems\u201d. This question has been addressed in \ngeneral and in a historical perspective, by authors such as Vygotsky or Bruner, and more \nspecifically by Jack Goody [1977] on the influence of graphic technology on culture. But \nin this paper, it is the very creators of a new media technique who raise the issue of its \nimpacts; which is a bit as if we had Gutenberg\u2019s reflections on his tool as he was \n19 \ndesigning it.  \nAnd in fact the Diver and WebDiver system developed by Pea & al., at the Stanford \nCenter for Innovations in Learning, around a new system of spatio-temporal indexing \nthey invented, enables a novel use of video by making it an easily pointable and \nannotable material. WebDiver makes it possible to do with video what we were doing on \ntext with a highlight marker and comments, by creating pointers in the video material. \nBut most important is that WebDiver enables collaborative use of video. Pea et al. show \nthat WebDiver makes video a media suitable for scientific and educational activities, by \nanswering the seven core challenges associated with creating common ground in a \nworkgroup: the problems of reference, attentional alignment, creation of \u201cimmutable \nmobiles\u201d, effective search retrieval and experience of collaborative work, access \npermissions, integrating the insights of a collaborative group, and finally establishing \ncoherent multi-party video-anchored discourse in an activity system. CSCVA (Computer \nSupported Collaborative Video Analysis) can now become a reality. For those who know \nhow cumbersome it was until now to use video as a research or educational material \nwithin a group, this is good news: the technical bottleneck is now disappearing.  \nBeyond the reflection on the nature of collaborative media analysis, this paper \nexemplifies what can be \u201cdigital ethnography\u201d and the use of ICT in research. ICT are not \nonly changing the layman\u2019s life, but also the life of scientists and academics. The use of \ndigital media for social science analysis will soon become more and more common in our \nfields. A few dozens of laboratories worldwide (including our own) are currently using \nWebDiver; we predict that such instruments will within a few years be part of the \nstandard toolbox of social sciences labs and teaching. For example our students at Ecole \ndes Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris now use it on an everyday basis and are \nenthusiastic. \n \nIn the same vein of proposing new tools to the scientific community, Valery Nosulenko\u2019s \npaper \u201cMeasuring activities in digital space by their subjective quality\u201d addresses the \nissue of observing behaviors in augmented environments. Nosulenko provides two \ntheoretical frameworks, and one methodology. The theoretical framework of Russian \nactivity theory [Rubinstein, 1922, 1957; Leontiev, 1975; Nosulenko & Rabardel, 2007] \ndeveloped since the 1930\u2019s but remained almost unknown in Western countries because \n20 \nof a lack of translation, has recently started to gain considerable momentum in the \ncommunities of social scientists involved in ICT [e.g. Nardi, 1996]. And indeed, because \nit takes into account intentionality, and considers the situation from the subject\u2019s \nperspective, this framework is remarkably efficient to describe complex and opportunistic \nbehaviors in rich environments; and also to support user-oriented design.  \nNosulenko also describes the \u201cperceived quality\u201d approach, a theory he and his school \nhave been developing over the last 20 years in the line of activity theory, primarily \napplied to acoustics, then cognitive engineering (in space programs and more recently in \nthe car industry and interface design). In a nutshell, this psychological approach provides \nmethodology to describe the subjective perception of objects from subjects\u2019 \nverbalizations and connecting it to the physical properties of artifacts and systems. \nNosulenko and colleagues use this framework to determine what properties of objects are \nactually relevant for subjects in the situations, and therefore to determine specification of \nsystems based on the activity the subjects try to perform.  \nNosulenko gives two examples of how this framework was used to analyze user activity \nin augmented environments, when interacting with a PDA, and in user\u2019s reactions to the \nHelloWall, a video system designed to enhance communication and awareness of social \nambiance in a distant location [Streitz & al, 2007]. The method provides operational \nguidance to connect the designers work to the user\u2019s perceptions, and hence gradually \nimprove systems. These techniques have been used in an ambitious attempt to create life-\nsize experiments where groups co-design new augmented environments in order to \nproduce a better work and social experience, \u201cexperimental reality\u201d. \n \nCharles Lenay\u2019s paper, \u201cTechnical mediation of perceptive interactions. Tactile \nencounters in shared digital environments\u201d is an unusual and deep contribution to the \nunderstanding of the nature of social encounter. He describes an experiment that is an \narchetype of \u201cencounter\u201d of two beings equipped with simplest capacity of movement \nand sensation; and shows that the intelligent nature of \u201cOther\u201d vs. artifacts is recognized \nthrough the intentionality of movements in keeping contact. \nIn this experiment blinded subjects can sense with their finger the position of pixels on a \ncomputer screen. As they move their cursor with one hand, a Braille cell produces a \ntactile signal on their other hand. This system (\u201cTactos\u201d), in the line of research opened \n21 \nby Paul Bach-y-Rita [Bach y Rita et al; 1969], enables subjects to reconstruct a \nrepresentation of \u201cwhat\u201d is there, and they soon build exploration strategies to identify \npatterns. Lenay uses this one-pixel system as an operationalization of \u201cperception\u201d to \ninvestigate the nature of \u201cpresence\u201d. In a creative and original psychology experiment (or \nis this experimental philosophy?), he connects pairs of blinded subjects through the \nsystem: each subject can \u201csense\u201d the other\u2019s cursor through the system. Lenay, by tracing \nthe movements of both cursors, their spatial and temporal interactions, uncovers the \nsubject\u2019s exploration strategies and analyzes how they manage to distinguish each other\u2019s \nsensitive \u201cdigital body\u201d from artifacts. The presence of Other is understood by the \nperception of Other\u2019s intentional and focused exploration strategies. In practice, One \nperceives the contact of the Other trying to follow as One moves; and this perception of \nOther is possible only if One cooperates and also searches contact of Other, in what \nbecomes a coupling of strategies where intentions can be shared. \nLenay discovers new conditions for what he calls \u201cperceptive crossings\u201d through a digital \nsystem: availability of a body-image for other users; direct link between perceptive \nactivity and the body-image; absence of self-perception of own body image. Some of his \nconclusions have deep philosophical implications, for example he suggests that subjects \ncan co-construct a shared world only if they have different, situated views of it. If all \nsubjects have a parallel, similar external view (like in television) the very notion of point-\nof-view disappears.  \nLenay\u2019s theoretical work has potential applications in digital communication systems; his \nnovel approach may start a new experimental trend to tackle with difficult \nphenomenological issues. It is both an example of what Cognitive Technologies bring to \nscientific exploration of complex social issues, and a means through which scientific \ninvestigation may provide new insights to the development of digital communication \nsystems.  \n \nYuri Alexandrov\u2019s paper \u201cHow we fragment the world: View from inside versus view \nfrom outside\u201d addresses the fundamental issue of the nature of mental objects. In an \naugmented world where objects become virtual, we cannot rely any more on the na\u00efve \nrealist view of \u201cobjects\u201d as material artifacts, since subjects deal with representations; and \nmost objects in the digital world are symbolic representations. How do we conceive \n22 \nobjects, subjectively? How are they constructed in the brain? Alexandrov\u2019s paper is based \non solid neuroscience, and, just as Lenay\u2019s paper uses an experimental approach to \nunderstand the nature of \u201cpresence\u201d, it uses sharp experiments to uncover the nature of \n\u201cobject\u201d. Alexandrov tackles with the difficult question of whether outward behavior \nunambiguously reflects the dynamics of processes in the subjective world and subject\u2019s \nbrain. Behind this question lay tough issues about how far we can use classic observation \nof subject\u2019s behavior to analyze activity.  \nHis experiments are conducted on animals, with very simple and classic conditioning and \nwith more complex operant as well: rabbits or rats are trained to perform various tasks \nwith objects (e.g. pushing a pedal to get food or avoid electric shock). Alexandrov, with \ncutting edge neuroscience techniques, monitors the brain activity at single cell level, a \ntechnique few labs worldwide have been able to master. The general theoretical \nbackground is that, at neuron level, achieving a behavioral result is accomplished by \nsynchronizing the activity of the neurons in different brain structures. By analyzing the \nsynchronization patterns of neurons, Alexandrov and his team are able to identify step by \nstep the detail of brain structures\u2019 activity underlying a given behavior, from onset (e.g. \nstimulation by a flash of light) to execution (motor activity e.g. pressing the pedal). \nHis findings are somewhat destabilizing, on one hand; on the other hand they open a new \npath for our approach of human behavior, and the design of new objects. In a nutshell, \nwhat characterizes objects and behaviors are intentions rather than physical shape. \nSimilar outward behaviors may be subserved by different brain activity if they have \ndifferent goals; while outwardly different behaviors may have similar brain bases if they \nhave the same goal. More precisely: \u201can environment, although similar in physical \nparameters, is differently reflected in the activity of central and peripheral neurons \ndepending on the goal of behavior. (\u2026) The sets of neurons activated in visual cortex are \ndifferent during presentation of identical flashes that induce different types of behavior \n(e.g. food-acquisition and defense).\u201d Specializations of neurons are formed in relation to \nthe systems, aimed at the achievement of specific results of both \u201covert\u201d and \u201ccovert\u201d \nbehavior.\u201d  \nAnother finding is that \u201cbrain subserving of behavior reflects the history of its formation. \nHence, the activation characteristics and sets of active neurons are different in outwardly \nsimilar forms of behavior with different history of forming\u201d. In other words, when a \nsubject learns something, the brain organization depends on how it is learned: something \n23 \nthat was learned by trial and error will not have the same neural basis as would have an \nidentical behavior learned by observation and imitation. Alexandrov also shows \nremembering is always a reconstruction, at neural level, and therefore every remembrance \nmay modify the object. The structures that were involved in learning are activated when \nthe subject performs what was learned, even if these structures are seemingly irrelevant to \nthe task at hand. For example, visual structures of the brain may be involved in behavior \nwithout individual\u2019s visual contact with the environment.  \nThe brain is a system where every new learning is built on existing structures, and \nmodifies the previous organization. Therefore, previously formed behavior is modified by \nforming a new behavior. \nThis paper may seem far from the usual papers in this journal, and it sometimes needs \nattention to follow for those unfamiliar with neuroscience \u2013which in Russian tradition has \nalways stayed linked with social science-; but deep questions sometimes necessitate going \nbeyond the usual boundaries of our own field. The consequences of Alexandrov\u2019s \nfindings for our problem are clear, and massive. Augmented environments should be \ndesigned with in mind the fact that it is goals which count for the subject. Therefore, what \nshould be stable in the pattern of virtual objects is \u201cwhat they serve\u201d rather than their \nphysical shape. The ever-changing flow of technology tends to distract us from the real \nissues by focusing our attention on the technical artifacts, which are indeed fascinating. \nBut society is about human intentions and desires, which are at the core of subjective life. \nIn our analysis of the consequences of digitization of society, we should keep focused on \nthe impact on the perceptions and intentions of subjects. \nAlexandrov\u2019s findings about learning give food for thought for those who want to \nmonitor the evolution of digital society. By training our children with digital learning \ntechniques; by using them on an everyday basis, we are modifying, at neural level, the \nvery way we perceive the world. Even \u201cclassic\u201d objects take a new meaning in this new \ncontext of practice. Past structures do not completely disappear, but they are \nreconstructed in new networks, for better or worse.  \nWhat is true at neural level is also the case at the higher level of society, in institutions, \nrepresentations, and material culture. \nAs we can see through all these papers, changes are currently taking place at the \ntechnology level faster than they do at representation level. Institutions have started \n24 \ntaking care of these issues of digital society, but they are often placed in front of a fait \naccompli. The lower, physical, layer of the leopard skin is full of large digitized spots but \nthe other layers are still mostly in last century\u2019s fabric. For these reasons, it seems useful \nthat social scientists take some active stand in this evolution.  \nPea et al. and Nosulenko papers provided us with methodological tools. These last two \npapers by Lenay and Alexandrov give food for thought to our community and enable us \nto understand better what is at stake in the digitization of objects and people; they \nhighlight what is important in their nature as seen from a human perspective. And indeed \nthe social science community needs new theoretical frameworks as well as new tools to \nanalyze the changes at hand.  \n5 Cognitive technologies and its social impacts \nTen years ago, in a special issue of Intellectica8 collecting papers from the first series of \nour seminars of the Cognitive Technologies program at Fondation Maison des Sciences \nde l\u2019Homme, we wrote that this era would probably be seen, later, as the Middle Ages or \nthe Antiquity of Cognitive Technology, and that there was not yet a clear dominant \nscientific paradigm to make sense of the upcoming digital revolution [Lahlou, 2000]. The \nbig issues were cognitive overflow, and the transformation of work and consumption \nprocesses.  \nWe are now in the next century; there are still no dominant paradigms, cognitive overflow \nis worse than ever, and we still hardly see where these transformations will lead us; the \nonly thing for sure is that the technological wave announced by Toffler [1980] has \namplified. At least, there is general awareness of the transformation, we gradually get \nmore insight of the nature of the general evolution towards digital projection, of how it \ngets implemented in practice, and of the mechanisms of diffusion of this technically-\ndriven cultural change. The issue is complex and needs cooperation of scientists, policy \nmakers, and stakeholders. \nThe Cognitive Technology program tries to create a space for discussion between social \nscientists and the research community in ICT. The public of the seminars and symposia \n                                                 \n8 Intellectica, 30, 2000\/1. Papers by D. Kirsh, E. Hutchins, S. Lahlou, A.V. Cicourel, C. \nHeath P. Luff G. Nicholls D. vom Lehn, W.E. Mackay, M. Zacklad: 222 p. \n \n25 \nfrom which these papers are extracted reflects the diversity of stakeholders in this \ntransformation: scientists, industry, policy makers\u2026 and doctoral students who are the \nnew generation of researchers in this field. The papers presented here are a sample of the \nlarge variety of social science research on the current transformation of society; but they \nall tend to take a constructive stand. Here social science does neither adopt an external \nand critical attitude towards technology, nor a consulting position to feed industry or \ncommerce; but rather a cooperative attempt with technology stakeholders to construct a \nnew installation of the common World, one that will be more sustainable and human-\nfriendly, by raising awareness of the social impacts of technology. A common \ncharacteristic of the authors is that they make efforts to master the technological aspects, \nat least enough to be able to engage discussion with designers. They do not hesitate to use \nthemselves these new technologies in their research; some of them even by getting \ninvolved in the very design of new technologies, at the risk of been considered as \nacademic mavericks. \nObviously, this is still work-in-progress, but one conclusion we can already draw from \nthis exercise is the necessity for trans-disciplinarity, between disciplines of human and \nsocial sciences, and even with life sciences and engineering. Another conclusion from \nthese collected papers as well as in the vast corpus of research produced by the growing \ncommunities of social scientists working on ICT issues, is that new forms of action \nresearch, where social scientists join efforts with designers, are now emerging which may \ncontribute to make the future digital world more human-friendly. This calls for more \ninitiatives like this one supported by Foundation Maison des Sciences de l\u2019Homme, \nwhich create space for constructive debates between research and the stakeholders of the \nsocial evolution in progress. \n \nBibliography: \nBACH Y RITA Paul, COLLINS Carter C., SAUNDERS Frank A., WHITE Benjamin, \nSCADDEN Lawrence (1969).
