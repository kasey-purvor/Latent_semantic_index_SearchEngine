If inflectional morphology were perfectly straightforward, a listing of \nthe inflected forms of a word for a given language would at the same time give us a list of the \nmorphosyntactic values relevant for that language. For example in Yir-Yoront (1), a Pama-\nNyungan language from the Cape York Peninsula, Australia, the distinct forms displayed by \nsuch words as \u2018foot\u2019 or \u2018leg\u2019 justify distinguishing an absolutive, ergative and dative case.  \n \n(1) Case forms in Yir-Yoront (Alpher 1991: 211, 345, 487, 503) \n \u2018foot\u2019 \u2018leg\u2019 \u2018arm\u2019 \u2018armpit\u2019 \nABSOLUTIVE thaml kumn puth ngamrr \nERGATIVE thamarr kumalh putha ngumurr \nDATIVE thamarriy kuman putha ngumurr \n \nOn the other hand, words such as \u2018arm\u2019 and \u2018armpit\u2019 fail to make the distinction between \nergative and dative -- these words then show syncretism of case. This apparent merger of \nmorphosyntactic values in a single form can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, it \nmight simply be an indication that morphological structure may diverge from functional \nstructure. On the other hand, there has long been an intuition that this identity reflects some \nfundamental affinity at the level of meaning or function (Plank 1991). In formal terms, we \nmight view it as a window into the otherwise covert structure of morphosyntactic feature \nsystems, i.e. revealing the building blocks of functional or semantic structure. It is safe to say \nthat, for linguistic theory as a whole, it is the latter interpretation which has attracted the most \nattention, particularly since Jakobson (1936) and Hjelmslev (1935-37). On this approach, \ndistinct morphosyntactic values may collapse if they overlap in meaning or function, and it is \nthis shared element which is expressed by the single form. For example, in the Dagestanian \nlanguage Xinalug, masculine and feminine gender are distinct in the singular, but typically \ncombined in the plural, thus x\u00e6kind\u00e6dum\u00e6 \u2018he\u2019ll laugh\u2019, x\u00e6skinkkud\u00e6m\u00e6 \u2018she\u2019ll laugh\u2019, but \nx\u00e6pkind\u00e6m\u00e6 \u2018they\u2019ll laugh (masculine or feminine)\u2019 (De\u0161eriev 1959:56). This syncretism is \nreadily analysed (\u2018masculine\u2019 + \u2018feminine\u2019 = \u2018human\u2019), and represents a cross-linguistically \ncommon pattern, so it is probably not a language-specific morphological quirk. Comparing \nthis sort of data from various languages, one can start to build up a picture of shared aspects \nof feature structure (see e.g. Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998, Cysouw 2003, Baerman, Brown \nand Corbett 2005 and Iggesen 2005). \nBut not all syncretism lends itself to a straightforward interpretation, and languages \nabound in patterns which are obscure in some way or other. It is the purpose of the present \narticle to present a typology of patterns which are attested, and consider what implications \nthese potentially have for models of morphology and morphosyntactic feature structure. I \nstart with simple patterns that are relatively easily described, and move on to more complex \npatterns that require more morphological machinery. Within individual theoretical models \nsome types may assume greater importance than others; likewise, some may turn out to be \nmore common than others. But a satisfactory theory should be able to accommodate all types, \nor convincingly demonstrate that it does not need to. Of course, syncretism is simply one \naspect of the larger question of how morphological form relates to function; an understanding \nof this smaller issue is crucial for understanding the larger one.  \n 2 \n \n \n2 FLAT FEATURE STRUCTURE. The simplest type of syncretism can be described by \nassuming a flat (unstructured) feature system and invoking underspecification. Take the \npresent tense of an English verb, which contrasts a 3SG form to one which collapses 1SG, 2SG \nand all plural values, e.g. sings versus sing. Compare this to the preterite form sang, which \ndoes not distinguish person-number at all. Since sang and sing are morphologically similar, \nin as much as they both lack an overt person-number ending, it is tempting to give them the \nsame morphological analysis, and say that sing does not so much collapse the values of \n1SG\/2SG\/1PL\/2PL\/3PL as simply fail to mark person-number at all. Sings is 3SG, while sing is \nsimply a morphological default, used in those contexts where the more specific form is not \nalready called for. This general principle is familiar under various names, such as the \nElsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973), Paninian determinism (Stump 2001), blocking \n(Aronoff 1976) or the Subset Princple (Halle 1997). While the idea that there is such a thing \nas a morphological default is itself relatively neutral, it may serve as the basis for two further \nassumptions that begin to have real consequences for what can and cannot be described \n The first assumption is that morphosyntactic markedness correlates with semantic \nmarkedness (see e.g. Carstairs-McCarthy 1998, Harley and Ritter 2002, Burzio 2005).  For \nany feature there is a default value, which is the semantically most basic one, e.g. singular for \nnumber or third for person. In a maximally economical system, these default values need not \nbe overtly represented in a morphological description, since they are inserted by a \nredundancy rule. By this logic, the description of a six-member verbal paradigm, such as that \nof the Spanish present (2) need contain overt reference only to 1st person, 2nd person and \nplural, while the values \u2018singular\u2019 and \u20183rd person\u2019 are supplied by default.   \n \n(2) Spanish present tense (viv\u00e9r \u2018live\u2019) \n    underspecified representation \n1SG vivo  1 \n2SG vives  2 \n3SG vive  ----- \n1PL vivimos 1PL \n2PL viv\u00eds  2PL \n3PL viven  PL \n \nThis mode of representation has underspecification already built into it. Syncretism naturally \nfollows if we underspecify for further values. For example, in the imperfect, 1SG and 3SG are \nregularly syncretic in Spanish. If we say that 1SG is underspecified, then it follows \nautomatically that it is syncretic with the 3SG. \n \n(3) Spanish imperfect tense (viv\u00e9r \u2018live\u2019) \n    underspecified representation \n1SG viv\u00eda  -----  \n2SG viv\u00edas  2 \n3SG viv\u00eda  ----- \n1PL viv\u00edamos 1PL \n2PL viv\u00edais  2PL \n3PL viv\u00edan  PL \n \n For such an approach to have explanatory value, there would need to be some more or \nless generally agreed upon model of the markedness relations between morphosyntactic \n 3 \nvalues which we would expect the data to conform to. However, this would not seem to be a \npromising enterprise, as there is no demonstrable consistency across different languages. \nConsider the verb paradigms from Tol, an unclassified language of Honduras, given in (4) \nand (5). Tol has two main conjugation classes, labelled \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018II\u2019. The present tense \nparadigm of both classes has six forms, distinguishing 1st, 2nd and 3rd person in both \nsingular and plural (likewise the past, which is distinguished from the present only by a \nprefix). The future tense paradigm for both classes is reduced: class I has four distinct forms \nand class II has five. The forms relevant for the present discussion are those ending in -kh in \nclass I and those in -m in class II.  \n \n (4) Tol, class I verb, vocalic stem \u2018put\u2019 (Dennis 1992: 41, 51) \nPRESENT  FUTURE  \nSINGULAR PLURAL  SINGULAR PLURAL \n1 \u0294yons\u00f3 \u0294yonsokh  ka mo\u0294ons\u00f3 ka mo\u0294onsokh \n2 \u0294yonson \u0294ons\u00f3  ka mo\u0294onson ka mo\u0294ons\u00f3 \n3 \u0294yonso ha\u0294onsoph  ka mo\u0294onsos ka mo\u0294onsokh \n \n \n(5) Tol, class II verb \u2018jump\u2019 (Dennis 1992: 77, 79) \nPRESENT  FUTURE  \nSINGULAR PLURAL  SINGULAR PLURAL \n1 tolos tyolokekh  ka ntolos ka ntolokekh \n2 tolom tolok\u00e9  ka ntolom ka ntolok\u00e9 \n3 tolo telo\u014b   ka ntolom ka ntolo\u014b  \n \nIn class I, -kh is 1PL in the present but 1PL\/3PL in the future. In class II, -m is 2SG in the \npresent but 2SG\/3SG in the future. On analogy with the analysis offered above for Spanish, \nthis could be attributed to underspecification: -kh is simply the unmarked plural ending for \nboth classes, and -m is the unmarked singular ending for class II. Their actual distribution is \nconstrained by the presence of more specific endings: class I \u20183PL PRESENT\u2019 -ph blocks the \nappearance of the underpecified \u2018PL\u2019 -kh, and the class II \u20183 PRESENT\u2019 -\u00d8 blocks the \nappearance of the completely underspecified -m. But note that this analysis requires overt \nreference to 3rd person, which means that the universal assumption that 3rd person is \nunmarked will not hold. Worse still, the apparent markedness values vary across the classes: \nin class I, it is the 1st person which is unmarked, while in class II, it is 2nd person. \n 4 \n The second commonly-made assumption involving markedness is that \nmorphosemantic markedness (in the sense of being overtly specified for a morphosyntactic \nvalue) correlates with morphological markedness (in the sense of bearing some overt bit of \nmorphology; see Croft 2003). From this we should expect to find overtly marked forms \nwhich are non-syncretic, and forms without overt morphology which are syncretic, following \nthe elsewhere condition. The English forms cited above (sing versus sing-s) are an obvious \nexample. But it is easy enough to find paradigms where a zero realization is found, but it is \nnot associated with the syncretic values. For example, Siuslaw (6), an unclassified language \nformerly spoken in Oregon, has enclitics which mark subject person-number, whereby the \n2SG and 3PL are identical. The 3rd person marker is zero, but it is not syncretic.  \n \n(6) Siuslaw (Frachtenberg 1922: 468)  \n SINGULAR DUAL  PLURAL \n1INCL -------- -ns -n\u0142 \n1 -n -aux\u00fbn, -ax\u00fbn, -nxan \n2 -nx -ts -tc\u00ee \n3 \u00d8 -aux -nx \n \nThus, the association of zero morphology with syncretism is not a particularly robust \ngeneralization.  \n \n3 COMPLEX FEATURE STRUCTURE. If feature structure is assumed to be flat, there can \nonly be one default value for any feature. Hence, if syncretism is seen as parasitic on feature \nstructure, there can be at most one instance of syncretism for a feature within a paradigm.1 \nExamples such as the Sorbian noun in (7) are then problematic. In Sorbian, a West Slavic \nlanguage of Germany, there is case syncretism in all three numbers. The singular and plural \neach have only a single syncretic form, which is unproblematic, but the dual has two: \nnominative\/accusative and dative\/locative\/instrumental.  \n \n(7) A-stem noun (\u2018woman\u2019) in Upper Sorbian  (Fasske 1981: 493, 496, 498) \n SINGULAR  DUAL PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE  \u017eona  \u017eonje  \u017eony  \nACCUSATIVE \u017eonu  \u017eonje  \u017eony  \nGENITIVE \u017eony  \u017eonow  \u017eonow  \nLOCATIVE \u017eonje  \u017eonomaj  \u017eonach  \nDATIVE \u017eonje  \u017eonomaj  \u017eonam  \nINSTRUMENTAL \u017eonu  \u017eonomaj  \u017eonami  \n \nIf syncretism represents a default feature value, then the feature must have two defaults \nwhich are distinguished from each other in some way; that is, the feature has some internal \nstructure. For example, to account for the Sorbian dual, we can set up an intermediate default \nshared by the dative, locative and instrumental, as in table 1, to which we might impute the \nvalue \u2018oblique\u2019. On this model, the nominative and accusative forms of the dual are fully \nunspecified and default to CASE, the genitive form is fully specified, while the dative, locative \nand instrumental forms are underspecified as OBLIQUE. \n                                                 \n1\n By \u2018paradigm\u2019 I mean the variants along one parameter, with all other parameters remaining constant. Thus in \n(7) one can speak of a distinct case paradigm for each number, and a distinct number paradigm for each case. \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 1. A possible model of case in Sorbian \n \nIt is probably fair to say that much of the interest in syncretism shown by contemporary \nlinguistics is stimulated by this possibility of applying syncretism as a diagnostic of otherwise \ncovert aspects of feature structure (see e.g. Calabrese 1998, Cysouw 2003, M\u00fcller 2004, \nWiese 2004). Various ways of construing this structure have been proposed -- trees, \nnetworks, binary feature values and the like, each with their own inherent constraints (see \nJohnston 1997 and Harbour 2007 for discussion of various systems and their properties).  \n \n4 STIPULATION. If syncretism is assumed to reflect a covert feature value, then it is \nreasonable to expect that the value thus revealed is a semantically plausible one. While there \nis no universal yardstick for determining what constitutes a plausible feature value, there are \nexamples of syncretism where the syncretized values clearly do not form a natural class in \nany readily comprehensible terms. For example, verbs in Dhaasanac (8), a Cushitic language \nspoken in Ethiopia, display a maximum of two person-number-gender forms, one for 1PL \n(exclusive), 2nd person, and 3rd person feminine, and one for 1SG , 1st person inclusive, 3PL \nfeminine and 3rd person masculine. (The alternation between the two forms is \nmorphologically heterogeneous -- suffixation, prefixation, ablaut, consonant alternation -- the \nexample illustrates just one of the many types.) \n \n(8) Dhaasanac (Tosco 2001: 112, 456) \n SINGULAR  PLURAL \n1INCLUSIVE ------  se\u00f0 \n1 se\u00f0  sieti \n2 sieti  sieti \n3 FEMININE sieti  se\u00f0 \n3 MASCULINE se\u00f0  se\u00f0 \n \nThough one of these two patterns might be treated as an elsewhere form, the other must still \nbe accounted for, and no model of feature structure yet proposed will combine such values. \nSince the pattern is clearly systematic, it must be encoded somewhere in the grammar. If it is \nnot due to feature structure, then it must simply be stipulated in the morphology. Of course, if \none were committed to the dictum that \u2018form ever follows function, and this is the law\u2019 \n(Sullivan 1896) then one could presumably construct a feature structure which would yield \nthe desired results. At a certain stage, though (and Dhaasanac surely is beyond that stage), \nsuch an exercise would become unedifying. Indeed, there is overwhelming evidence for \nmorphological units which operate at cross-purposes to syntax and semantics (Maiden 1992, \nAronoff 1994, Blevins 2006).  \nNOM                      ACC                    GEN                        DAT        LOC          INS \nOBLIQUE \nCASE \n 6 \n One way of representing this is through simple disjunction, i.e. the syncretism of \nfeatures \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 can be represented as {x or y} (as in Dalrymple and Kaplan 2000). \nAlternatively, one might imagine morphological structure as a system parallel to \nmorphosyntactic structure. One would simply need to substitute the idea of morphological \nfeatures (Spencer and Sadler 2001, Corbett and Baerman 2007) for that of morphosyntactic \nfeatures. For example, we might propose that the Dhaasanac verbal paradigm has the shape in \ntable 2, where the 1PL, 2nd person and 3SG feminine forms share the morphological feature \n\u2018B\u2019, while the other forms share the (default) morphological feature \u2018A\u2019 (see Baerman, \nBrown and Corbett 2005: 185).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FORM 1 FORM 2 FORM 3 FORM 4 FORM 5 FORM 6 FORM 7 \n (1SG)   (3SG M)    (1INCL) (3PL)           (1PL) (2) (3SG F) \n \nTable 2. A possible model of the morphological structure of person marking in Dhaasanac \n \nThese features have no inherent meaning, they simply codify the organizing principles of the \nparadigm of forms. Such an approach presupposes the existence of morphology as a distinct \ncomponent of grammar, but does not presuppose any specifically morphological devices; \neverything is achieved by underspecification. \n However, there are limits to what underspecification can express. An especially tricky \nexample comes from second declension nouns in Latin (9). This declension class has both \nmasculines and neuters. The neuters, as in other Indo-European languages, show \nnominative\/accusative syncretism. In the singular this is realized as -um, the same ending that \nserves for the distinct accusative of the masculines. So far, this is a perfectly banal instance of \nsyncretism, which could be analyzed by any of the devices described above. For example, we \nmight say that the form in -um can serve for both nominative and accusative, but in the \nparadigm where a more specific nominative form in -us is available, the form in -um is \nrestricted to the accusative. Things get more interesting when we consider the behaviour of a \ntiny class of exceptional neuters in -us, such as pelagus \u2018sea\u2019.2 As expected for neuters, \nnominative and accusative are syncretic, but the form ends in -us rather than -um. \n \n                                                 \n2\n It consists of the native words vulgus \u2018crowd\u2019 and v\u012brus \u2018poison\u2019 and the word \u2018sea\u2019, which is a borrowing \nfrom Greek. Other Greek borrowings in -us may occasionally receive the same treatment, such as c\u0113tus \u2018large \nsea animal, whale\u2019 and chaus \u2018chaos\u2019; otherwise, they take a distinct accusative in -um (Neue and Wagener \n1902: 502-504). \nB \nA \n 7 \n(9) Latin second conjugation (singular forms) \n masculine  \n\u2018slave\u2019 \nnormal neuter  \n\u2018war\u2019 \nneuter in -us \n\u2018sea\u2019 \nNOMINATIVE   serv-us bell-um pelag-us \nACCUSATIVE serv-um bell-um pelag-us \nGENITIVE serv-\u012b bell-\u012b pelag-\u012b \nDATIVE serv-\u014d bell-\u014d pelag-\u014d \n \nThe problem is this: a simple underspecification account requires that forms in -us be overtly \nspecified as nominative, but this is belied by the behaviour of nouns such as pelagus, which \nshows that forms in -us may be syncretic. If both -um and -us are nominative\/accusative, how \ncan we account for their distribution in the paradigm of servus? The only systematic way to \nrepresent this pattern across the three sub-classes is to separate the forms from their \nmorphosyntactic distribution. For neuters, nominative and accusative are always syncretic, \nbut the form that this takes varies. For most items, it takes the form otherwise displayed by \nthe accusative, but for the small class of nouns like pelagus, it takes the form of the \nnominative. This redistribution of forms has been called a \u2018rule of referral\u2019 (Zwicky 1985, \nCorbett and Fraser 1993, Stump 2001), \u2018takeover\u2019 (Carstairs 1984) or a particular type of \nreadjustment rule (Halle 1992). What distinguishes this from the underspecification \napproaches described above is that this relationship is at cross-purposes with the rest of \nmorphological structure, and so must simply be stipulated. The status of such rules is \ncontroversial, viewed by some as a superfluous morphological device (Wunderlich 2004).  \n \n \n5 DIACHRONY. The abstract question of how best to analyze syncretic patterns becomes \nmore concrete when we look not at static examples, but at dynamic systems, in particular, \ninstances of diachronic change. In some cases these provide evidence of an actual collapse of \nfeature values at the morphosyntactic level, while others involve a merger of only of the \nforms themselves.  \n Feature-based syncretism is most clearly represented where one finds the apparently \nspontaneous reorganization of the system of morphosyntactic values. Consider the \ndevelopment of the dual and plural from Common Slavic to Slovenian. The changes can be \nattributed to regular sound change (denasalization of \u1ebd, loss of word-final \u012d and \u016d), except for \nthe genitive and locative dual. In place of the expected ending -u, the corresponding forms of \nthe plural are found.  \n \n(10) Development of the genitive and locative dual in Slovenian \n Common Slavic  Slovenian \n DUAL PLURAL  DUAL PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE  du\u0161i du\u0161\u1ebd  du\u0161i du\u0161e \nACCUSATIVE du\u0161i du\u0161\u1ebd  du\u0161i du\u0161e \nGENITIVE du\u0161u du\u0161\u012d  du\u0161        \u0001 du\u0161  \nLOCATIVE du\u0161u du\u0161ax\u016d  du\u0161ah    \u0001 du\u0161ah \nDATIVE du\u0161ama du\u0161am\u016d  du\u0161ama du\u0161am \nINSTRUMENTAL du\u0161ama du\u0161ami  du\u0161ama du\u0161ami \n \nThis change should be seen in the wider context of the loss of the dual as a number value, \nfamiliar from other Indo-European languages. That is, it is probably a reflection of the \nincipient consolidation of the values dual and plural at the morphosyntactic level. Further \ndiscussion of feature-based syncretism can be found in Luraghi (2000).  \n 8 \n Form-based syncretism is most clearly seen where a regular sound change produces \nhomophony for some forms which is then extended to others. One fairly clear example is \nrepresented by the 1SG in Livonian, a Finnic language formerly spoken in Latvia. In an earlier \nperiod, the 1SG ending was -n in both present and past, a state of affairs still found in \nEstonian. With the regular loss of final -n the 1SG fell together with the endingless 3SG in the \npast. In the present, where the 3SG ending is -b, no homophony should have resulted. But \nwhat we find is that 3SG -b has been extended to the 1SG, i.e. the superficial pattern of \nsyncretism of the past has been extended to the present.  \n \n(11) Livonian (Kettunen 1938: LX) compared to Estonian (verb \u2018kill\u2019) \n Livonian  Estonian \n PRESENT PAST  PRESENT PAST \n1SG tapab tapiz  tapan tapsin \n2SG tapad tapist  tapad tapsid \n3SG tapab tapiz  tabab tapis \n1PL tapam tapizm(\u0259)  tapame tapsime \n2PL tapat tapist(\u0259)  tapate tapsite \n3PL tapab\u0259d tapist(\u0259)  tapavad tapsid \n \nThis suggests that the patterns that result from phonological accidents may be construed as \nsystematic, and so enter into the morphological system. The syncretism of second and third \nperson in the plural found in the preterite, likewise an example of regular sound change, \nseems also to have been partially extended to the present, being restricted to the negative \nparadigm (Kettunen 1938: LXI).3 See Hansson (to appear) for a similar but more complex \nchange in the case system of Saami. \n More often than not, though, it is hard to tease apart morphosyntactic and \nmorphological change. Bazell observed (1960: 1) that \u2018simultaneous morphemic and \nphonological similarity\u2019 tend to attract each other. For example, the weak masculine noun \nparadigm in Old English (Mercian and West Saxon, to be precise) shows massive syncretism: \na single ending -an is shared by the accusative, genitive and dative singular and the \nnominative and accusative plural (12a). This is not a result of regular sound change, which \nshould have produced a more differentiated paradigm (12b).4 \n \n                                                 \n3\n This is formed with a proclitic negative auxiliary. In the singular, the main verb is uninflected, while in the \nplural, the 3PL has the same form as the 2PL. The auxiliary itself shows number syncretism, with the plural \nforms inflected as singulars (Kettunen 1938: LXI): \n \n  \u2018don\u2019t read\u2019 \n 1SG \u00e4p=tapa \n 2SG \u00e4t=tapa \n 3SG \u00e4p=tapa \n 1PL \u00e4p=tapam \n 2PL \u00e4t=tapat \n 3PL \u00e4p=tapat \n \n(Note that the final consonant of the auxiliary is devoiced when followed by a voiceless consonant.) \n4\n Compare this with the behavior of verbal forms, e.g. helpan \u2018help.INF\u2019 versus hulpon \u2018helped.PL\u2019 (Sievers \n1921: 199).  \n 9 \n(12) Endings of weak masculine nouns in Old English (Bazell 1960: 3) \n a. attested  b. expected \n SINGULAR PLURAL  SINGULAR PLURAL \nNOMINATIVE -a -an  -a -an \nACCUSATIVE -an -an  -on -on \nGENITIVE -an -ena  -an -ena \nDATIVE -an -um  -an -um \n \nIt does not seem possible to ascribe this change to one single component; rather, it results \nfrom a conspiracy of functional and formal analogies. \n \n \n6 CONCLUSION. In the preceding sections I have tried to show to what extent syncretism \ncan be derived from morphosyntactic structure on the one hand, and how much needs to be \nattributed to purely morphological structure on the other. It is not a crystal-clear picture \nwhich results, since the bulk of examples one can find will easily lend themselves to \nalternative analyses. In the light of this, there are the three approaches which I believe it is \npossible to take: \n \n1. Ascribe syncretism wholly to morphosyntactic features. A theory of syncretism which \nderives it from morphosyntactic features is more restrictive, and so is to be preferred, all else \nbeing equal (Noyer 1998, Bobaljik 2002). However, no model of feature structure has yet \nbeen advanced that will account for the attested patterns of syncretism, and patterns such as \nthat in (9) above suggest that none ever will. Therefore, if this approach is to be maintained, \nsome principled treatment of the exceptions must be found.5  \n \n2. Ascribe syncretism wholly to morphology. On the assumption that morphological structure \nis language-specific, this approach will allow any pattern to be described. However, it leaves \nopen the question as to why some syncretic patterns are commonly more attested cross-\nlinguistically than others. Therefore, such an approach has to clarify exactly how morphology \nis linked to morphosyntactic structure, and what (if anything) governs their correspondence to \neach other.  \n \n3. Admit indeterminacy.  There is good evidence both for a morphosyntactic and a \nmorphological approach to syncretism, but the bulk of examples are indeterminate, and admit \nof either interpretation. Rather than treat this as an embarrassment, one might take the \nindeterminacy as a characteristic of inflectional paradigms. Indeed, developments such as that \nfound in Old English (12 above) suggest that this is the case.  \n \nThe third approach, I believe, holds the most promise. Since the analysis of static examples \nwill do little to resolve the issue of what lies behind the ambiguity, effective research in this \ndirection should focus on dynamic systems, that is, across variants. The most time-tested tool \nfor looking at this is historical linguistics, as suggested in \u00a75, but other disciplines which treat \nvariation might be brought to bear too, such as dialectology (Aalberse, to appear), acquisition \nstudies or psycholinguistics.  \n \n                                                 \n5\n Understandably, restrictive theories of syncretism make claims about systematic syncretism, but not about \naccidental homophony. While accidental homophony surely exists, there are no ready diagnostics for identifying \nit. In particular, the diachronic continuum discussed above with respect to Livonian (figure (11)) shows that the \naccidental can be reinterpreted as systematic. \n 10 \n  \n \nREFERENCES \nAalberse, Suzanne (to appear).
