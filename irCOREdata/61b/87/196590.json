The use of FEM simulations to \nobtain the filling of the dies and to optimize the \nthixoforming process is clearly of great interest. To carry \nthis out properly, the semi-solid flow and the heat \ntransfer into the die have to be correctly described. In \npractice, various constitutive equations are used since \ndiscrepancies appear between experimental rheological \ndata. In addition to the shear-thinning behaviour, the \nconstitutive equation has to describe peculiar phenomena \nsuch as the presence or not of a plastic threshold, normal \nand abnormal behaviour, namely hardening and \nsoftening stress-strain rate relationship [1-4]. In a \nprevious work, Favier et al [5] proposed a constitutive \nequation accounting for the mechanical role of four \nphases within the material: the solid globules, the solid \nbonds, the entrapped liquid and the free liquid. The \nevolution of the microstructure with the shear rate is \ncaptured via an internal variable that modifies the \nliquid-solid spatial distribution. This model, originally \nestablished in a viscoplastic framework, captures the \ntransient response for shear rate jump tests for solid \nfraction lower than 0.5 [5].  In this paper, it is extended \nto account for elastic-viscoplastic behaviour. We \nanalysed the transient behaviour using rapid compression \ntests. Experimental load-displacement signals revealed \nthe presence of an elastic-type response in the earlier \nstages of deformation [6]. The elastic feature of the \nbehaviour is attributed to the response of the porous solid \nskeleton saturated by incompressible liquid. We \nsimulated rapid compression tests considering solid \nfraction higher than 0.5 and that the initial semi-solid \nmaterial displays a continuous solid skeleton. We \ncompared and discussed the results with the experimental \ndata obtained in Professor Atkinson\u2019s team [6]. Typically, \nthe experimental load\u2013displacement curve strongly \nincreases up to a maximum and thereafter decreases and \nincreases again. The strong initial rising part and the \nsubsequent fall in load are well captured by the \nmodelling. It is shown that the fall in load originates \nfrom a 3D continuous solid skeleton, which breaks down \nunder load as suggested in literature. The effect of solid \nfraction on the mechanical response is studied. \n \n2 Background semi-solid response under \nrapid compression test \n \nFig.1 shows the load-displacement curves of \nsemi-solid aluminium alloys under rapid compression \ntrials at constant ram speed (500 mm\/s) for various \ntemperatures [6]. We focused on the black curve \ncorresponding to 574\u00b0C and approximately to 0.7 solid \nfraction. Deformation in the initial rising part of the \n  \n815 \nload-displacement curves but also in the subsequent parts \nis macroscopically homogeneous (deduced from \nmicrostructure observations in Fig.1). The strength of the \nsemi-solid is mainly due to the solid skeleton strength. \nThe entrapped liquid may contribute to carrying the load: \nthe pressure in the entrapped liquid develops from the \nresistance to the motion of liquid in response to \nvolumetric changes of the porous solid skeleton [7]. The \nbehavior of the solid skeleton saturated with entrapped \nliquid is elastic-viscoplastic. Indeed, the \nload-displacement curves start from (0,0); the initial slope \nis high and has low sensitivity to the strain rate. However, \nthe peak load increases with increasing strain rates [6]. \nThe origin of the quite high strain sensitivity of the peak \nload is not clear. During this first stage, some grain \nboundary decohesion occurs. The subsequent fall in load \nis attributed to the breakdown of the 3D solid skeleton \n(see e.g. [5]). The lost of stiffness of the solid skeleton is \nthought to be very rapid and is followed by a slower \ndisagglomeration process of the solid agglomerates. \nBehaviour in the final rising part is not completely \nunderstood. It may be linked to the increase of the strain \nrate due to the decrease of the current slug height. It may \nbe also attributed to solidification phenomena leading to \nan increase in solid fraction. These solidification \nphenomena would be due to thermal exchanges with the \nspecimen environment.  \n \nFig.1 Load signals and microstructures at different \ntemperatures for Alusuisse A356 Al Alloy (ram speed: 500 mm\/s) \nfrom Liu et al [6] \n \n \n3 Modelling \n \nBased on micromechanics analysis and homogenization \nprocedure, the present model is an extension of a \nprevious model, developed to describe the transient \nresponse of semi-solids [5], to capture the initial rising \npart of the load-displacement curves for rapid \ncompression tests (Fig.1). Contrary to the previous \nmodel which assumed pure viscoplastic behavior, the \nnew model assumed that semi-solids exhibit \nelastic-viscoplastic response when loaded under rapid \ncompression. In the current work, the solid fraction, , \nis higher than 0.4 and typically around 0.7. The \nrepresentative volume element (RVE) of the studied \nsemi-solid contains solid skeleton and isolated solid \nagglomerates, free liquid and entrapped liquid. The solid \nskeleton is considered as a porous solid phase saturated \nby an incompressible Newtonian fluid. The semi-solid is \nrepresented by a Voigt Model having two branches (Fig \n2). The first branch represents the solid skeleton \nsaturated with entrapped liquid (K). The second branch \ncontains the free liquid and the isolated solid \nagglomerates. It is labeled as concentrated suspension (C). \nThe fraction of the saturated skeleton is \u03c8. The fraction \nof the concentrated suspension is 1-\u03c8. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig.2 Schematic representation of semi-solids for the \nmicromechanical modelling \n \nThe choice of the Voigt model is justified by the fact that \nthe deformation is macroscopically homogeneous. Thus, \nthe strain rate tensors of (K) and (C) are given by \n                                (1) \nwhere  is the overall strain rate. The overall stress \ntensor is given by \n                       (2) \nwhere  and  are the average stress tensors of the \nsaturated skeleton and the concentrated suspension, \nrespectively. When semi-solid deforms, parts of the solid \nskeleton break down up to the complete failure of the 3D \nsolid network. As a result, semi-solid appears as a \nsuspension composed of isolated solid agglomerates. \nFrom modeling point of view, these changes are \nrepresented by the change of \u03c8  with the overall strain \nand strain rates as follows:  \n\u03c8 1-\u03c8 \nsaturated solid \nskeleton (K) \nconcentrated \nsuspension (C) \nactive zone \n(A) \ninclusion \n(I) \n200 \u00b5m \n  \n816 \n                    (3) \nwhere  is constant and characterizes the \ndisagglomeration rate of the solid skeleton. The initial \nvalue of \u03c8 is assumed to be given by \n                          (4) \n \nwhere  is the percolation threshold prescribed at 0.4 \n[8]. \n \nThe saturated skeleton is assumed to have an \nelastic-viscoplastic behaviour: \n                           (5) \nwhere  is the elastic moduli tensor and is the \nviscoplastic strain rate of the saturated skeleton.  \n \nThe viscoplastic behaviour is given by a power-law type \nequation: \n       (6) \nwhere  is the deviatoric part of the stress tensor,  \nis the Von Mises equivalent viscoplastic strain rate,  is \nthe consistency and   is the strain rate sensitivity \nparameter associated with the saturated skeleton.  is a \nreference slip rate equal to 1 s-1. \n \nThe concentrated suspension is assumed to behave as a \nnon-Newtonian fluid: \n \n                                 (7) \n \nwhere  is the viscosity of the concentrated suspension. \nThis viscosity is given by the previous micro-macro \nmodel [5]. This model distinguishes the role of four \nmechanical phases: the isolated solid \nglobules\/agglomerates, the solid bonds between the solid \nglobules, the free liquid and the entrapped liquid. Note \nthat, for the concentrated suspension, the entrapped liquid \nis trapped inside the solid spheroids and agglomerates \n(not inside the continuous 3D solid skeleton). The \nviscoplastic deformation is assumed to be accommodated \nby the solid bonds and the free liquid. In contrast, the solid \nisolated agglomerates deform very little though they \ncontribute to increase the suspension viscosity. In a \nstatistical representation, this complex microstructure is \nviewed as a spherical inclusion (I) gathering all the solid \nagglomerates entrapping some liquid surrounded by a \ncoating composed of the solid bonds and the free liquid \n(Fig.2). As the overall deformation is mainly \naccommodated by the coating, the coating is labeled as \nthe active zone (A). The viscosity of the concentrated \nsuspension is calculated by the self-consistent \napproximation developed for coated inclusion where the \nvolume fraction of the active zone and the inclusion are \n and  respectively. In this model, the \ninclusion and the coating are also two-phase systems. The \ncoating (active zone) consists of the solid bonds and the \nnon-entrapped liquid with volume fractions  \nand , respectively. The inclusion is composed of \nboth solid and liquid with volume fractions   and \nrespectively, to represent entrapped liquid within \nthe solid agglomerates. \n \nAssuming that the volumes of liquid and solid do not \nchange, the following equations have to be checked \n                              (8) \n                      (9) \nV is the volume of the RVE. ,  are the volumes \nof solid belonging to the skeleton and to the \nconcentrated suspension, respectively. ,  are the \nvolumes of liquid belonging to the skeleton and to the \nconcentrated suspension, respectively. We can easily \ndemonstrate that all theses quantities can be expressed \nas a function of , , . \nWe assume that \n                               (10) \nEq.10 captures that when  or  increase, the \namount of solid belonging to the skeleton increases. As \nmentioned in Section 2, the breakdown of the solid 3D \nskeleton is followed by a disagglomeration process of the \nsolid agglomerates leading to a suspension having more \nand more isolated solid spheroids. To capture this \nmicrostructural change, we assumed that the amount of \nsolid bonds decrease as follows [5]: \n  \n817 \n                    (11) \nwhere  is the critical shear required to break a solid \nbond.  is the average shear rate in the solid \nbonds. It is given by \n                          (12) \n is the average equivalent strain rate of the solid of \nthe active zone. It is naturally deduced from the \nself-consistent model. Further details are found in [5]. \n \nConcerning the local behavior of the phases, the \nconstitutive equations of the liquid phase and the solid \nphases are: \n                        (13) \n   (14) \nThe exponents l and g,b refer to the liquid and solid \n(globules and bonds) phases, respectively. \n \nTo determine the effective properties of the \nconcentrated suspension, we firstly evaluated the overall \nbehaviour of the inclusion and of the active zone from the \nbehaviour of the solid and liquid phases. Secondly, we \ncalculated the effective concentrated suspension. To do so, \nwe used modeling based on micromechanics and \nhomogeneization techniques and the so-called \nself-consistent approximation. Further details are found in \nFavier et al [5]. \n \n4 Results and discussion \n \n   Model parameters were identified to match the \nexperimental curve obtained by Liu et al [6] for a solid \nfraction around 0.7 (574\u00b0C) and a ram speed equal to 500 \nmm\/s. The radius and the height of the initial slug were \n18 mm and 44 mm, respectively. Parameters associated \nwith the material representation are listed in Table 1. \nRheological parameters are listed in Table 2. Note that \nthe liquid viscosity was not identified but taken from \nexperimental measurements [9]. Both set of parameters \nremain constant for all the subsequent simulations, \nunless otherwise stated. \n \n \nTable 1 Set of parameters associated with the representation of \nthe material used for simulations of compression tests \ns\nAinitialf\n \n c\u03b3  Af  \ncf  \n0.401 200 s-1 1        0.04 0.4 \n \n \nTable 2 Set of constitutive parameters used for simulations of \ncompression tests \nSkeleton \n   \n100\u00d7106 Pa 20\u00d7106 Pa.s 0.2 \n \n \nSolid Liquid \nKg Kb mg=mb Kl \n17\u00d7105 Pa.s 17\u00d7105 Pa.s 0.2 1.8\u00d710-3Pa.s \n \n \nFig.3 compares the experimental load-displacement \ncurve with the calculated curves assuming an \nelastic-viscoplastic or pure viscoplastic behaviour for \nsemi-solids. The predicted load-displacement for pure \nviscoplastic hypothesis is simply deduced from the \nelastic-viscoplastic model considering that the skeleton \nhas pure viscoplastic behaviour. At the start of the \ncompression, the load is mainly carried by the saturated \nskeleton. With assuming pure viscoplastic behaviour, the \npredicted load displays a threshold Lc that does not exist \nin the experiment (Fig.3). In addition, the initial slope is \ntoo low. However, a very good quantitative agreement is \nobtained with the elastic-viscoplastic model (accounting \nfor elasticity) except at the end of the compression test \nwhere the slope is underestimated.  During deformation, \nas the bonds of the solid skeleton breakdown, some liquid \nis released, and more and more isolated solid \nagglomerates are created. As a result, the contribution of \nthe concentrated suspension increases and the overall \nbehaviour becomes mainly viscoplastic.  \n  \n818 \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nLo\nad\n (k\nN\n)\nDisplacement (mm)\nExperimental data (fs~0.7)\nElastic-viscoplastic behaviour\nPure viscoplastic behaviour\n \nFig.3 Experimental and predicted load-displacement curves \nassuming an elastic-viscoplastic or pure viscoplastic behaviour \nfor semi-solids \n \nFig.4 shows the liquid viscosity sensitivity of the \nload-displacement curves.

In good agreement with the \nexperiments of Liu et al [6], the model predicts that the \ninitial slope and the height of the peak fall with decreasing \nsolid fraction (or increasing temperature). The minimum \nload before and beyond the peaks also decreases with \ndecreasing solid fraction. The peak occurs at lower \ndisplacement with decreasing the solid fraction. \nThe fraction of skeleton decreases with decreasing \noverall solid fraction. As a consequence, the skeleton \ncontribution to carry the load decreases at the start of the \ntest (lower initial slope and peak load). Also, the \nconcentrated suspension contributes more significantly at \nsmaller displacements. Then, the load is reduced during \nthe subsequent deformation because the suspension \ncontains a smaller solid fraction.  \n \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nLo\nad\n (k\nN\n)\nDisplacement (mm)\nfs=0.8 fs=0.7 fs=0.6\n \nFig.5 Predicted load-displacement curves of isothermal \ncompression tests for different solid fractions. \n \n \n5 Conclusions \n \nThroughout this paper, the response of semi-solids \nduring rapid compression is analysed and modelled. The \nproposed model is an extension from a previous model to \naccount for elastic-viscoplastic behaviour. We analysed \nthe experimental transient behaviour using rapid \ncompression tests. Experimental load-displacement \nsignals revealed the presence of an elastic-type response \nin the earlier stages of deformation. The elastic feature of \nthe behaviour is attributed to the response of the porous \nsolid skeleton saturated by incompressible liquid. We \nsimulated rapid compression tests considering solid \nfraction higher than 0.5 and that the initial semi-solid \nmaterial displays a continuous solid skeleton. Typically, \nthe experimental load\u2013displacement curve strongly \nincreases up to a maximum and thereafter decreases and \nincreases again. The strong initial rising part and the \nsubsequent fall in load are well captured by the modelling. \nIt is shown that the fall in load originates from a 3D \ncontinuous solid skeleton, which breaks down under load \nas suggested in literature. The model predicts that the \ninitial slope and the height of the peak fall with decreasing \nsolid fraction.  \n \nReferences \n \n[1] LOUE W R, SUERY M, QUERBES J L.
