Two studies conducted in Greece and Britain \nthat explored the views of Muslim women on school experiences of physical \neducation are compared. Both studies focused on diaspora communities, \nGreek Turkish girls and British Asian women, living in predominantly non-\nMuslim countries. Growing concerns about global divisions between \n\u2018Muslims and the West\u2019 make this a particularly pertinent study. Qualitative \ndata were collected by interviews with twenty-four Greek Muslim women, \nand twenty British Muslim women.   \nPhysical education has national curriculum status and a similar rationale in \nboth countries but with different cultures of formality and tradition, which \nimpacted on pupils\u2019 experiences. Data suggested that Greek and British \ngroups held positive views towards physical education but were restricted on \ntheir participation in extra curricular activities. For the British women \nreligious identity and consciousness of Islamic requirements were more \nevident than for the Greek women. Differences in stages of acculturation, \nhistorical and socio-cultural contexts contributed to less problematic \nencounters with physical education for Greek Muslims who appeared more \nclosely assimilated into the dominant culture.  \n 3\nRATIONALE \n \nAccording to the literature, predominantly generated in England, young \nMuslim women can face particular issues at school during secondary (11 \u2013 18 years) \nphysical education and sports activities as a result of either actual or perceived \nrestrictions placed on them by their culture, sex, religion and ethnicity. It seems that \nall these factors can be powerful forces that restrict female participation rates (Carroll \nand Hollinshead 1993, Benn, 2002a). The aim of this interpretive study was to \nexamine similarities and differences in the perceptions of twenty-four Greek and \ntwenty British Muslim women of physical education, school experiences and extra \ncurricular sporting provision.  \nIslam is the fastest growing religion in the history of the world (F.A.I.R. \n2004). Diaspora communities of Muslims are growing in many Western countries, \nand evidence suggests that Muslim communities and Muslim women in particular, \nface similar difficulties across national boundaries (Jawad and Benn 2003). As the \nworld confronts increasing challenge in relation to growing media-fuelled \nislamophobia in the West and a simmering discourse of \u2018polarisation of civilisations\u2019 \nbetween Islam and the West, it is important to examine the experiences of similar \ngroups in different diaspora communities (Allen and Nielsen 2002, Richardson 2004).  \nThe rationale and value of comparative studies is \u201c\u2026 to gain greater \nawareness and a deeper understanding of social reality in different national contexts\u201d \n(Hantrais 1996, p2). Thanks to the work of scholars such as Ken Hardman there is a \nwealth of evidence about the \u2018macro\u2019 picture of the \u2018promises and realities\u2019 of \nphysical education provision in Europe and world-wide (Hardman and Marshall \n2005). There is less cross-national research into \u2018micro\u2019 perspectives, lived \nexperiences and realities of students in physical education and sport, which \n 4\nstrengthens the need for the current study (Papaioanou 2000, De Knop 1996). Insight \ninto the experiences of Muslim students in different contexts can contribute to \nimproved knowledge of how complex overlays of religion, gender, culture and \nethnicity impact on experience of the subject.  \nThere has been a shift in comparative research towards recognising the \nimportance of interpretative studies provided the societal contexts are acknowledged. \nThe complexities of any cross-national comparative work are acknowledged, because \nwhile similarities will exist \u201c\u2026 there are also differences and variations based in \npolitico-ideological, socio-cultural, economic values and norms and ecological \nsettings\u201d (Hardman and Marshall 2005, p61). The pursuit is driven by a commitment \nto the rights of all young people to participation in physical education and sport. In \nthis case the Greek and British backgrounds of the researchers helped with \nsensitivities towards the linguistic, socio-cultural and institutional contexts that can \ncreate obstacles in understanding \u2018thought processes, values and ideologies\u2019 when \nconducting such research (Hantrais 1996, p4, Hantrais and Mangen 1996).  \n Questions of cultural difference and complexities of multiple identities in the \npost-modern world, impact on any interpretive comparative study.  The Greek and \nBritish Muslim women in this study share a global religion, but they exist in \ndistinctive, predominantly non-Muslim countries, where religion and education have \ndeveloped in different cultural contexts. The dynamic, fluid nature of cultures, \ninfluencing and being influenced by the cultures of others, or \u2018cultures of hybridity\u2019, \nare a reality of the modern world and will be influential in this study (Hall 1992, \nJenkins 1997). For example, the growth of the Muslim diaspora in Britain is much \nmore recent than in Greece ensuring differences in the inter-relationship of diaspora \nand host communities. Similarly, increased sophistication of managing \n 5\n\u2018intersectionality\u2019 of social identities that moves beyond the simple \u2018additive\u2019 \ndiscourse of disadvantage is recognised in making sense of, for example, experiences \nof black, Muslim women in Britain, such as those in this study (Scraton 2001, Benn \n2005).  Any research in this area needs to remain sensitive to the fact that individuals \ndifferentially negotiate their multiple and complex layers of identity. Processes of \nglobalisation and cultural assimilation add to the complexities of the comparative \nstudy on experiences of Greek and British Muslim women. The problems of \ndeciphering religious requirements from pseudo religious community practices also \nadd to the challenge of any research in this area.  \nIslamic culture refers to the lived experience of being a Muslim. \u2018The code of \nliving is expressed through Islamic laws laid down in the Shari\u2019ah. These codes imbue \nIslamic culture, giving meaning to the way in which Muslims make sense of their \nlives, behave, dress, eat and drink\u2019 (Benn, 1996, p. 6). The all-encompassing nature of \nIslam is well-described by Mawdudi: \n \nIslam is not a religion in the Western understanding of the word. It is at once \na faith and a way of life, a religion and a social order, a doctrine and a code \nof conduct, a set of values and principles and a social movement to realize \nthem in history. \n (Mawdudi, 1989, 12) \nIt needs to be stated that Muslim females are not an homogeneous group and \nthat there are differences in how they choose to resolve religious and other cultural \ndemands. For example, some choose to adopt the hijab (head-scarf) and Islamic dress, \nothers do not. There is clear evidence that those women who adopt Islamic dress in \nthe West suffer an increase in violence, discrimination, prejudice and exclusion \n 6\n(Runnymede 1997). This is always exacerbated in backlashes after major terrorist \nevents such as September 11th 2001 in New York and Madrid in 2004 (Allen and \nNielsen 2002, Jawad and Benn 2003, Richardson 2004, F.A.I.R. 2004). With growing \nevidence that Muslim women can face similar problems of disadvantage across the \nworld (Jawad and Benn 2003), gaining insight into the schooling experiences of \nyoung Muslim women in Greece and Britain adds another dimension to the limited \nliterature in the area.  \n \nISLAM, GENDER AND PHYSICAL EDUCATION      \n   \nResearch into the experiences of ethnic minority groups has accelerated since \nthe late 1980\u2019s. In 1988 Carrington and Williams suggested that Muslim students face \ndifficulties in physical education, and that ethnicity heightens gender differences and \nshapes different attitudes and beliefs, with girls facing more problems than boys. \nAccording to their study, these problems are due to religious and cultural traditions, \nwhich assign particular roles to men and women, and contain strict codes controlling \nbehaviour and conduct, thereby restricting access to physical education. Fleming\u2019s \n(1991) study of Asian Muslim youth mentions the low value placed on sports and \nphysical education, and this was supported in De Knop et al\u2019s 1996 research into the \nimplications of Islam on Muslim girls\u2019 sports participation in Western Europe.  \nAccording to Benn (1996), Islam and physical education share some common \nconcerns, the central issue being control of the body, in time and space, in rituals and \ncleanliness, in dress, in the control of diet and pursuit of a healthy body. Furthermore, \nboth perpetuate gender specific notions of masculinity and femininity, and have been \ndescribed as male domains in which there has been an imbalance of power between \nthe sexes (Benn, 1996; Scraton, 1993; Ennis, 1998). Tensions between cultural \n 7\npractices of Islam and physical education have been identified, for example, dress \ncodes for women, mixed \/ single-sexed groupings, attitudes towards the body related \nto privacy and modesty, extra curricular activities, Ramadan, swimming and dance \nactivities. The Islamic requirements for modesty and privacy are not met in kit \nrequirements for short skirts, shorts and tee-shirts, public changing and showering \nsituations. After puberty Muslim pupils are supposed to be sex-segregated and many \nsecondary school environments do not permit this. During Ramadan many Muslims \nfast from sunrise to sunset so energy levels and hydration are risk factors in physical \neducation and sporting activities. Swimming is sometimes problematic because of the \nmixed-sex public nature of swimming baths, and there is no consensus in Islam about \nthe educational value of some curriculum subjects like dance and music (Carroll and \nHollinshead, 1993, Parker-Jenkins 1995, Benn, 1996, 2000a, 2000b, Ansari 2002, \nMcDonald and Hayes 2003).  Such tensions can continue into adulthood (Wray 2002, \nBenn 2003). The recent outcry against the French banning of religious symbols in \nstate schools, and the hijab for Muslim girls in particular, raises awareness of tensions \nacross Europe (Vaisse 2004). Wider global issues have been recognised for some \nMuslim women wishing to participate in sport at a serious international level \n(Hargreaves 2000).  \n The literature reviewed suggests there could be shared experiences for young \nMuslim women across national boundaries, in relation to tensions at the interface of \nphysical education, sporting activities and Islam. In exploring these issues across \nBritish and Greek boundaries the significance of context: historical, geographical, \npolitical and educational, will be important in analysis and interpretation. The \nfollowing studies offer insight into the lived-experiences of young Muslim women \n 8\nand their encounters with physical education and sporting activities in their secondary \nschooling years.  \n \nMETHOD \n \nAlthough the paper analyses two separate studies, which were conducted \nindependently, there were many similarities that enable the method to be discussed at \nthis point. The two groups shared many characteristics, gender, religion, and \nmembership of ethnic minority groups in predominantly non-Muslim countries. The \nmajor weakness in terms of finding purposive homogeneous sampling was that the \nGreek respondents were still at school (both Greek state and single faith Muslim \nschools) and aged 13 \u2013 15 years and the British group were at an English University, \naged 18 \u2013 21 years of age. The latter group was participating in a larger life history \nproject, which asked them to recall their school physical education experiences. In the \ncontext of a comparative study it is not unusual to have to \u2018compromise\u2019 on method \n(Hantaris 1996), and in such a rare research area the authors acknowledge the issue \nbut did not see it as a barrier to the comparative study.  It did lead to some interesting \noutcomes that could lead to further important research in the area. The focus in both \nsets of interviews was on the perceptions of the young Muslim women of their school-\nbased physical education and sporting activity experiences.  \nInterviews were seen as the most appropriate investigative tool in order to \ngenerate data based on the informants\u2019 own words. Since the study is based within the \ninterpretive paradigm, it is important to formulate a detailed description and \nexplanation of certain phenomena based on the data collected. This would include \nhow people experience their own world, and how they express these experiences.  \n 9\nThe interview schedules for both sets of students were similar in their \nexploration of school-based physical education experiences. Semi-structured \ninterviews allowed space for similarities and differences to be explored. Views on \nschool and the curriculum were explored as well as direct questions about their \nperceptions of physical education and extra curricular activities. Questions concerning \nbeliefs about religious or cultural factors, and ways in which these did or did not \ninfluence participation also formed part of the interviews.   \nInterviews were tape recorded and transcribed and \u2018respondent validation\u2019 was \npossible for both groups. After coding each transcription the process of identifying \ncommon themes started. This process was based on deductive and inductive analytical \nprocedures, which involved scanning the data for categories and relationships among \nthe initial categories, developing working typologies on an examination of initial \ncases and then modifying and refining them on the bases of subsequent cases. \nConsequently, new categories emerged as well as sub-divisions in each category (Le \nCompte et. al, 1994). A detailed description of the students\u2019 responses was shared \nbetween researchers to enable similarities and differences to be identified.   \nA strength was the British and Greek backgrounds of the researchers, which, \nas already mentioned, helped with sensitivities towards the socio-cultural and \nlinguistic sensitivities required for such research (Hantrais 1996). In terms of \nsignificant differences, the researchers do not share the religious identity of \nrespondents, one researcher was male in a female research domain, the other was \nwhite in a \u2018black\u2019 arena, defined here to include people of South Asian as well as \nAfrican-Caribbean heritage (Parekh, 2002).  There is no consensus in the literature on \nthe positive and negative effects of such differences but the researchers are committed \n 10\nto removing barriers and striving to improve understanding, judiciously and \nsensitively (Haw 1996).  \n \nSTUDY ONE \u2013 THE BRITISH MUSLIM EXPERIENCE \nThe British Muslim context \n \nThere are no reliable figures but it is thought there are approximately 1.5 \nmillion Muslims in Britain (Ansari 2004). The Muslim ethnic minority group in \nBritain is a relatively \u2018new\u2019 group. Although Muslims have been in the country since \nthe mid nineteenth century the largest migration has been post 1945, predominantly \nfrom South Asia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, in response to demand for labour. Many \narrived in the 1960\u2019s before legislation curtailed entry. Numbers of Muslims arriving \nin Britain declined in the 1970\u2019s but have risen in the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s with \nincreased movement of refugees and asylum-seekers (Ansari 2002, 2004).  The \nmajority of British Muslims are still of South Asian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi \norigin. \nRichardson (2004) provides mounting evidence of growing islamophobia in \nBritain that is a fear and intolerance of Islam and Muslim people based on lack of \nknowledge and understanding about the religion. It is fuelled by the media through \nreporting of events that links terrorism and fundamentalism to Islam and all Muslims. \nBack-lash, prejudice and discrimination are particularly vehement against \u2018visible \nMuslims\u2019 who have adopted Islamic dress.   \nAnsari (2002, 2004) gives examples of vast differences in the ways in which \nMuslim communities and individuals negotiate their space, cultural practices and \nidentities, with both \u2018fission and fusion\u2019 or polarisation and integration occurring \nsimultaneously. It is also interesting to note that the 1980\u2019s saw a resurgence of \n 11\ninterest in \u2018real Islam\u2019 amongst young Muslim men and women who attempted to find \ntheir own understanding of Islamic texts and interpretations that were meaningful to \ntheir current lives. Increasing numbers of British Muslims are choosing to \u2018privilege \nthe religious component\u2019 of their identity. The empowering effect of adopting Islamic \ndress has been part of that trend for some Muslim women.  \nEducation has been recognised as one of the few arenas that have made \npositive changes in relation to the needs of Muslims (Parker-Jenkins 1995, Ansari \n2002) but there are continuing problems with low achievement amongst some Muslim \ngroups and alienation from the education system. Where Islamic religious \nrequirements are not met in schools advice from some sectors of the British \ncommunity is for the exemption of Muslim children: \u2018\u2026 head teachers should exempt \ntheir Muslim pupils from those areas where they cannot meet the Islamic \nrequirements\u2019 (Sarwar 1994, p14). Physical education is at greater risk than most \nother subjects in meeting Islamic requirements.  \n \nThe Physical Education \/ Sporting Activities Context \n Physical education has been part of the formal curriculum for over one \nhundred years. When England and Wales adopted a National Curriculum for physical \neducation in the early 1990\u2019s it reflected a willingness to improve consistency of \nprovision and to offer a curriculum of \u2018entitlement\u2019 through which all pupils had \nsimilar experiences and opportunities. (Scotland and Ireland also have a physical \neducation curriculum but these are independent). Emphasis is placed on developing \npupils\u2019 physical competence and confidence, skilfulness, creativity and \ncompetitiveness, promoting positive attitudes and active and healthy lifestyles (DfEE \n\/ QCA 1999). The processes of learning occur through six activity areas: games, \n 12\ngymnastics, dance, swimming, athletics and outdoor and adventurous activities. Extra \ncurricular provision has a similar long history as part of normal school provision, with \nvariable success, dependent on many factors. Increased centralised government focus \non standards in education and extending provision has meant increased funding and \ncontrol over extra curricular as well as curricular activities in recent years.  \n \nThe Muslim Physical Education experience \nMuch of the research into the experiences of Muslim girls and women in \nEngland indicates variable practice in relation to accommodating the needs of \nMuslims. There are very recent signs of positive change. In conjunction with political \nshifts to a more \u2018inclusive\u2019 society many schools have adopted accommodating \npolicies in physical education. For example, some departments are allowing track \nsuits to be worn, increasing single-sex teaching where appropriate, making showers \noptional, ensuring new-build facilities have more privacy in changing \/ showering \narrangements, and adapting demands during Ramadan, to engage pupils in less \nvigorous but valuable ways in the lessons. Most significantly, the growing political \nsensitivities towards \u2018inclusion\u2019 of marginalised groups, such as Muslim girls, was \nencompassed in the latest National Curriculum for physical education documentation. \nThis stated that religious and cultural needs of pupils have to be met and examples \nwere given such as accommodation of dress codes, and modifying activities for \nMuslim pupils who fast during Ramadan (DfEE\/QCA 1999).  \nThe indications are that policy and practice are moving in a more liberal and \naccommodating direction in British education. Change appears to be patchy and the \nevidence suggests tensions and restrictions on young Muslim women persist. The \nliberal approach to accommodating religious difference in the British education \n 13\nsystem is reflective of a history in which religion (albeit Christianity) underpinned \nmuch of the development of education. Increased plurality of the population has \nmeant limited accommodation to religious difference. Approaches in other countries \nvary. For example in France, which has a secular education system, a law was passed \nin 2004 to ban all religious symbols, including the hijab (Muslim headscarf). This was \nseen by many as an affront to human rights and as a discriminatory policy  (Vaisse \n2004).  \n \nSTUDY TWO \u2013 THE GREEK MUSLIM EXPERIENCE \nThe twenty-four Greek respondents were from the northern part of Greece, \nwhich has the largest Muslim ethnic minority group of Turkish origin in the country. \nThe ethnic community has settled here since the Ottoman occupation. In contrast to \nthe recent diaspora of the British Muslim group the Muslims in Greece are \ndescendants of an occupying \u2018elite\u2019, a politically dominating presence which lasted \nfor centuries. The Lausanne treaty in 1923, which facilitated the exchange of Greek \nand Turkish nationals between the two countries, did not include the Turkish \npopulation living in the north part of Greece and the Greek population living in \nIstanbul. Nowadays the Muslim ethnic minority group represents nearly 30% of the \noverall population in Northern Greece. They represent working and middle class \nsections of society, and generally speak Turkish as their first language, whereas the \nmajority population speaks Greek and is Christian Orthodox.  \nThe Muslim community in northern Greece has its own schools, which are \nsingle faith (Islam) and the languages of instruction are Greek and Turkish. They \nfollow the same curriculum as Greek State schools for subjects taught in Greek \nlanguage, and they have their internal curriculum for the subjects taught in the \n 14\nTurkish language, such as Religious Education, History and Language. However a \nlarge number of Muslim children attend Greek State primary and secondary schools, \nwhere Greek is the only language of instruction. Physical education is a compulsory \nsubject for all schools and physical education classes are coeducational, with both \nboys and girls following the same curriculum.    \n \nThe Physical Education \/ Sporting Activities Context \n In Greece the national curriculum for physical education in secondary schools \nwas introduced in 1990. The aim of physical education is to enhance students\u2019 \npsychological and body strength so that each student reaches his and her full potential \nregardless of race, gender, religion and culture. Alongside this, physical education \ncontributes to the development of students\u2019 personalities and their ability to live a \nharmonious and creative life (NCPE for Greece, 2001). An additional goal is to \nintroduce students to various aspects of physical education and sports so they learn \nthe value of lifelong participation and the health benefits of being physically active. \n The physical education curriculum in Greece covers the teaching of the skills \nof games such as football, basketball, volleyball, as well as athletics, gymnastics and \ndance. All physical education classes in secondary schools are co-educational and \nboth genders should be offered the same opportunities and taught the same games and \nactivities (NCPE for Greece, 2001). Extra-curricular activities in Greek schools have \na similar long history. They consist of competitive team sports such as football, \nbasketball and volleyball as well as athletics. Each school has its own sports teams \nand is represented in county and national championships. More importance is given to \nthe competitive aspect of the sport than the holistic value of exercise and physical \n 15\nactivity, which is reflected in the low level of students\u2019 involvement in such \ncompetitive extra-curricular activities.  \n \nRespondents \nIn Britain the group were predominantly South Asian, sixteen of the twenty \nrespondents described themselves as second generation British Asian Muslims, whose \nparents had come to England from Pakistan for work between 1950 and 1970.  The \nremaining four students were of Arab or African-Caribbean origin. All were educated \nin English State schools and were students at one University having recently left \nschool. In Greece the group consisted of all Muslim students of Turkish origin aged \n13-15 years, with twelve studying in a Greek State secondary school and the rest in a \nsingle faith (Muslim) school in Northern Greece. All respondents were female. Since \nthere were many overlaps in emergent data the results will be presented thematically \nusing the themes of \u2018perceptions and enjoyment\u2019, \u2018religious requirements and \nparticipation\u2019 and \u2018 participation in extra curricular activities\u2019. \n \nResults \nPerceptions and enjoyment of PE  \nMost students in the British study had enjoyed physical education and, \nsimilarly recognised its value to health and well-being. The happiest memories for \nthe majority were at primary school (4 \u2013 11 years) but this was not true for one: \nWhat I remember really, really hating was having to do it (PE) in my \nknickers and vest \u2026 I was embarrassed and ashamed because we were \nbrought up with that feeling that you should hide your body \u2026 and there \nwere boys in the class as well \u2026 I had those feelings. \n 16\nThose British Muslim students who had enjoyed secondary physical \neducation the most were in all-girls schools where some did participate in extra \ncurricular activities such as netball with great pleasure. Some who went through \nmixed schools had positive experiences as well: \nI was the only Muslim in my school, a mixed school, and I was allowed to do \nwhatever I needed to do, I could adapt the uniform. They said they would \nrather me do PE with jogging bottoms on than not do PE at all so they used to \nallow that. \nTeachers were a powerful influence on the self-concepts of the students and the \nconsciousness of their multiple identities: \n\u2026 there was a group of us \u2013 the Asian students, mostly Muslim, who weren\u2019t \nvery good .. we weren\u2019t very encouraged in sports \u2026 so many Asian girls are \nnot good at sport.\u201d  \n In the Greek experience Muslim females perceived physical education as \nan enjoyable subject, where they had fun: \u2018I love PE, we play games and we have \nfun with our peers\u2026\u2019 Many females stated that physical education was an \nimportant lesson that could provide them with healthier and fitter bodies:  \nIn order to have healthy bodies we have to exercise, PE is a means to a \nhealthy and fit body, and due to heavy schedules at school, it is our only \nhour where we can exercise\u2026. I also think that after all these hours of \nintensive classes, you can relax by doing PE\u2026  \nPhysical education was seen as a welcome break during school hours and the girls \nreported that they had a pleasant and enjoyable time: \nI like PE, it\u2019s not like an ordinary lesson\u2026I like it because I can exercise \nmy body. It gives me the feeling that I am healthy\u2026 \n 17\nThe students perceived physical education as an \u2018easy\u2019 lesson to participate in, one \nthat could provide them with knowledge about certain activities and body movements \nas well as about rules and games. Also it was seen as a lesson that did not need any \nspecific preparation at home, and one in which \u2018everyone had good grades\u2019. \nIn contrast, the attitude of one student towards physical education was very \nnegative. Her participation in physical education was limited to twice a term, the \nminimum required participation according to the school\u2019s policies, for a student to \npass the subject: \n\u2026I hate PE, I have always hated PE. I get bored\u2026I only participate twice, \nand always get an absence (on the register) in PE\u2026 \nThis appeared to be related to lesson content and a long history of dislike but it is \nunclear how that began.  \n Overall the attitudes of the Muslim students were positive, with \nrecognition of the health benefits of the subject and its \u2018difference\u2019 to the rest of \nthe curriculum. There were noticeable \u2018conditions\u2019 to the enjoyment of the British \nstudents, which related to good and bad inclusive pedagogy and practice, as will \nbe further evidenced in the next section. Enjoyment was linked to success, doing \ninteresting activities in a comfortable environment, with understanding teachers. \n \nReligious requirements and participation in PE  \nIn the British study, where there were some difficulties in secondary \nphysical education experiences that were related to school policies and practices \nnot accommodating the religious requirements of Muslim adolescents. For \nexample, some teachers made no concessions to their strict physical education \npolicy rules to wear a particular kit so the respondents found \u2018coping strategies\u2019 \n 18\nlike \u201cpulling our socks up and skirts down to cover our legs.\u201d  Similarly, the \nissue of needing \u2018private\u2019 spaces for changing meant many \u201cchanged in the \ntoilets\u201d and they found ways of avoiding showers. Tensions with the public \nnature of swimming baths were encountered, and were exacerbated at Ramadan \nwhen some did not want to swim because they were fasting: \n\u2026 swimming during Ramadan \u2026 my father had to go to the school again \nto ask for me to be excluded \u2013 it was a struggle. I did think sometimes \n\u2018why am I battling with them? They are going to think I am a \ntroublemaker with a problem with everything\u2026 but I am not like that, I \njust want to have what the others have, as well as being Muslim.  \nAnother student articulated her view of teachers\u2019 lack of awareness of \ntheir needs: \u201cI am often surprised at the lack of knowledge that teachers have \nabout Islam and Muslims.\u201d  Others found teachers willing to listen and facilitate \nchanges, which helped the Muslim students to participate. It was the open or \nclosed attitudes of teachers towards Islam and Muslims that contributed to the \npositive or negative experiences encountered by the Muslim women (Runnymede \n1997). Where they met \u2018open views\u2019 they found teachers willing to listen and take \npositive action to help them.  \nDuring their adolescent years some of the British Muslim students recalled \nwanting to adopt the dress code of covering the body, participating only in same-\nsex groupings, and seeking privacy for changing, but often schools did not make \nthis possible. Reflecting on their experiences in school the students identified \nadolescence as a phase of growing awareness of Islam and what it meant to be \nMuslim, within their families, communities and country. They were aware of \nincreasing levels of consciousness of \u2018being Muslim\u2019 which impacted on their \n 19\nability to participate in physical education. Some had chosen to study Islam to \nfind \u2018true\u2019 meanings for themselves. The issues were not related to a willingness \nto take part in physical education but to a need for concessions on traditions and \nsystems of organisation that were not conducive to Islamic requirements.  As they \nbecame more religious the awareness of tensions increased:  \nI went to a mixed secondary school and it was a nightmare \u2026 I did not \ntake religion seriously then \u2026 it was only when I started becoming \ninterested in religion that I recognised the requirements \u2013 around 16 \u2013 17 \n\u2013 before that I\u2019d adopt Islamic dress when I felt like it \u2026 the PE was \nsegregated but it wasn\u2019t really because we did it in public spaces\u2026  \nThe growing influence of Islam on life experience is clear in this statement. \nAwareness of religious expectations on dress, social and behaviour patterns was a \ngradual process for the women in the study. The lived experience of Islam \nappeared to be very different for the students in Britain and Greece but whether or \nnot greater religious consciousness would occur in the Greek students as they \nprogressed into adulthood cannot be judged in this paper. \nNone of the students interviewed in the Greek schools identified any \ncultural or religious issues that might have prevented them from participating in \nphysical education. In relation to Ramadan some fasted for a month, others \nintermittently but this did not affect participation in physical education for most \nstudents:  \n\u2026It is a bit difficult to fast and do PE but it\u2019s something I learnt to do \nfrom an early age and I am used to it now\u2026I enjoy the lesson so much and \noften I do not have the time to realise I am fasting\u2026  \n \n 20\nI don\u2019t see it as a problem (fasting and participating in PE)\u2026I eat a good \nbreakfast so it keeps me full till the next time I will eat, I might get a bit \nthirsty but this is not a problem\u2026   \nThree negative cases mentioned that fasting and doing physical education \ncould be problematic, \u2018\u2026I think it is (problematic) because you can not be energetic \nwithout drinking or eating, but I think that we have got used to it\u2026\u2019. Some mentioned \nthat to avoid situations where they felt too weak to participate in physical education \nwhile fasting they fasted only during the weekends or during the holidays. One \nrespondent explained: \u2018\u2026well I am not fasting the whole month, just some days, I fast \nonly the days that I do not come to school, that means weekends and holidays\u2026.\u2019  \nAgain the teacher was a significant influence on participation. The Greek \nstudents mentioned that their teachers were asking them before each physical \neducation lesson during Ramadan if they wanted to be exempt with no record of \nabsence in the register. As two students mentioned in their interviews: \nOur teacher is very understanding in cases where we do not feel fine (due \nto fasting). They allow us not to participate, however, we participate, as \nwe ought to\u2026\u2026 My teachers ask us before the lesson if anyone faces any \nproblem and does not want to participate, if I feel weak I ask for \npermission not to participate and they allow me without any problem\u2026    \nGreek students felt that teachers understood their religious and cultural needs. Where \nthe teachers were Muslim themselves (where this occurred they were male Muslim \nteachers) students recognised more flexible teaching plans with less strenuous and \nphysically demanding activities during the religious festival of Ramadan, which was \nhelpful. In addition they had physical education lessons during the early school hours. \n 21\nThe kit required for physical education was relaxed. Girls wore tracksuit \nbottoms, leggings and a head scarf if they chose but some stated that they did not \nwear short skirts since no one was wearing them at school even though they were \nwearing them at home, indicating the importance of peers and apparently liberal \nfamily views on dress. \n To summarise, the meeting of religious requirements was more problematic in \nthe British study than the Greek study. Three factors appear to contribute to this, first \nthe patchy awareness amongst British teachers of the religious requirements of \nMuslims. Second, there was higher consciousness and anxiety about the importance \nof meeting religious requirements amongst the British students. This could be \nattributed to the more recent diaspora and identity struggle for some British Muslims \nin \u2018relatively new\u2019 immigrant communities. Third, traditions such as appropriate kit \nare part of a history of subject pedagogy and practice, which evolved in a more \nsecular society and have only recently been challenged by increasing cultural \ndiversity. Where Greek students did want to pursue a stricter religious lifestyle it \nappears accommodation to needs was less contentious. It is interesting that the \nIslamic requirement for single-sex post puberty provision was never raised in the \nschools used in the Greek study, which were all co-educational, both state and \nMuslim schools, with mixed-sex physical education. Teacher sensitivity to fasting \nand vigorous exercise was varied in both studies. The recommendation for \nrecognition of the need for adjustment of activity levels is now enshrined in the \nNational Curriculum (for England and Wales) inclusion statement but that does not \nmean that it exists everywhere in practice (DfEE \/ QCA1999, p36).  \n \nParticipation in Extra Curricular Activities  \n 22\nSome of the Muslim students in Britain were not allowed to attend extra \ncurricular activities and were often resentful of the fact that their brothers were \nallowed more freedom than they were. It was interesting that in families where a \nrespondent was the eldest daughter, life was often freer for those \u2018coming behind\u2019 \nsuggesting a move towards more liberal acceptance of wider community \nparticipation with the passage of time.  \nNot all respondents were similarly affected and this was dependent on \ntheir religiosity. There were others in the study who were in families and \ncommunities that took a more liberal position towards their Muslim identity in \ncontemporary Britain. For those students there had been no difficulties with \nparticipating in school physical education dress codes, mixed-sex lessons and \nextra curricular activities but they were aware of the difficulties faced by their \nfriends whom they deemed to be \u2018more religious than them\u2019. They recognised the \nincreased prejudice and discrimination experienced by their friends because of \ntheir \u2018Muslim visibility\u2019. This was exemplified by the following comment about \nrelationships within the student-group:  \nI (a non-hijab wearer) am just Asian to (others), not Muslim. Even though \nthey might be a bit rude towards me they are not as rude as they are to the \nhijab girls because they\u2019d know I\u2019d answer them back and the hijab girls \nwould be more respectful and dignified. \nSimilarly in Greece, although students\u2019 attitudes towards physical education \nwere positive, their participation in extra-curricular activities was very limited. Some \nschools only provided activities for boys. Only one student participated in the \nschool\u2019s basketball team. Most of them expressed lack of interest in extra-curricular \nactivities and the kind of sports provided by the school as the main reason for non-\n 23\nparticipation. Some identified heavy schedules in school and failure to pass \u2018elitist\u2019 \nphysical and technical tests to become members of the teams, as the main factors for \ntheir lack of participation:  \nI don\u2019t participate. I have heavy schedules and I don\u2019t have spare time. \nEven if I wanted to participate I wouldn\u2019t have passed the tests\u2026  To enter \nthe teams you have first to pass some physical and technical tests and they \npick up those who pass the test with success\u2026  \nAn interesting unexpected issue emerged from the interviews. When asked \nif they participated in any form of physical activity outside school, some stated \nthat during the weekends they played games with their friends in their \nneighbourhoods or they were members of local fitness clubs but only when they \nhad completed their homework. These statements indicate that the students \npreferred a more relaxed way of exercising, for example visiting local fitness \nclubs or playing informal games with their friends. In contrast to some British \nstudents the Greek respondents said they would have no problem getting parental \npermission to participate in extra-curricular provision but there would be \nproblems if it interfered with \u2018academic progress\u2019, for example:   \n\u2026They (parents) had some hesitations at the beginning about how I would \ncombine the two (homework and fitness club)\u2026I proved to them that I can \ncombine them successfully and now they don\u2019t have a problem\u2026 \nIn summarising the results section, a comparison of responses about physical \neducation and sport experiences from British and Greek students revealed some \nsimilarities and some differences. Both groups recalled positive and negative \nencounters in the subject and extra curricular activities. Experiences were dependent \non the attitudes of their immediate community, peers, parents, personal religiosity and \n 24\nthe attitudes and actions of their physical education teachers. The British students \nrecognised that religious consciousness grew during their adolescent years, the \nyounger ages of the Greek respondents made comparisons of this phenomenon \nimpossible but it would make a useful further investigation. The change in religiosity \nbrought both empowerment as Islamic identity strengthened, and new tensions, for \nexample in physical education where Islamic requirements were not met. The British \nstudents were quick to point out the differences and confusions between religious \nrequirements and cultural practices, where some community restrictions were often \n\u2018un-Islamic\u2019 and wrongly used to prevent their participation in wider opportunities.  \nThe Greek respondents did not see religious or cultural barriers to \nparticipation in curriculum time although there were some institutional restrictions on \ntheir extra curricular participation related to gender biased provision or unattractive \nactivities. All pupils recognised the importance of their teachers\u2019 attitudes, beliefs, \nempathy and understanding that could make the difference between positive or \nnegative experiences in physical education.  \n  \nDISCUSSION  \nGreek and British principles underpinning the subject of physical education \nand its contribution to the development and welfare of children were similar. \nCulturally the subject was less formal in Greece with more relaxed dress codes, and \nvarying degrees of implementation, for example provision in the Greek schools \nenabled one student to participate in just two lessons a term which met the minimal \ncriteria to \u2018pass\u2019 in the subject in that school. The recommendation and aspiration in \nall English State schools is for a minimum of two hours provision per week for every \npupil.  \n 25\nIn the Greek and British experience most Muslim students perceived physical \neducation as an enjoyable subject, where they had fun. Cothran (et. al, 1998), \nidentified \u2018fun\u2019 as an instrumental goal, a means of attaining other valued goals of \nstudents\u2019 engagement and compliance and this was seen as the key reason for \nstudents\u2019 participation.  \nThere were differences in the ways in which religion impacted on experiences \nin physical education which is attributable to the different socio-historical contexts of \nthe long established Greek Muslim population compared to the relatively recent \ngrowth in British Muslims. The Greek students suggested that their religion and \nculture did not have any affect on their participation in physical education classes, \neven during the religious festival of Ramadan. The English students recognised \ngrowing awareness of Islamic requirements for modesty, dress codes and single-sex \nenvironments during their adolescence, and some experienced tensions in physical \neducation when some teachers\u2019 traditionalist approaches to the subject appeared \ninflexible and lacking in understanding of Islamic requirements. Most of the British \nstudents experienced increasing religiosity during adolescence that exacerbated \ntensions where religious requirements could not be met.   \nIt is interesting that the Greek schools and physical education lessons were co-\neducational, and the physical education teachers were male. These factors did not \ncause concern for the young Greek Muslim women or their families. This indicates a \nmore liberal and integrated, modernist interpretation of being Muslim in the Greek \ncontext, which contrasted with a greater struggle to retain distinctiveness, religious \nand cultural values for many of the British Muslims. Such factors are complex and \nrelated to different histories of arrival and integration of diaspora communities in the \nhost country, its politics, laws and institutions. The relatively recent success of British \n 26\nMuslim communities in having their rights acknowledged, and in developing their \nown institutions, including Muslim schools, have only occurred since the 1980\u2019s. This \nwas a period that saw a reawakening of interest amongst young second generation \nBritish Muslims, in Islam and their Islamic heritage (Ansari 2004). The \ndistinctiveness of diaspora communities and their histories in different countries \nrequires further research to improve understanding of similarities and differences in \nthe Muslim experience across national boundaries.  \nThe Greek teachers were more empathetic to the religious and cultural needs \nof those young Muslim students who did adhere to practices such as fasting. Some \nteachers made allowances and changed teaching plans to accommodate their needs. \nCarroll (1993) and Carroll et al (1993) suggested British students\u2019 perceptions of their \nteachers\u2019 understanding of Muslim culture were negative. There was more ignorance \non the part of some British teachers in the current study and \u2018closed\u2019 views of Islam \nwhich were unhelpful (Runnymede 1997, Richardson 2004). Some Muslim \nrespondents had met informed, empathetic teachers with open views of Islam (ibid). \nThe direction of current policy and practice from government informs National \nCurriculum legislation that provides teachers with clear statements to meet the \nreligious and cultural requirements of pupils in physical education, as part of a \nstronger policy of inclusion (DFEE\/QCA 1999). Such action would include allowing \npupils to wear track-suits that cover arms and legs, reducing activity demands during \nRamadan and being sensitive over gender groupings and issues of privacy.  \n Although both Greek and British students\u2019 attitudes towards physical \neducation were positive their recorded participation in extra-curricular activities was \nvery limited. For the Greek students no religious or cultural factors were mentioned \nas reasons for non-participation. The British respondents mentioned cultural rather \n 27\nthan religious barriers to their participation, particularly in relation to their gender. \nThis supports the findings from Carroll\u2019s (1993) research in which students \nmentioned cultural reasons as factors for non-participation in extra-curricular \nactivities, for example \u2018girls being needed in the home to help with jobs.\u2019 Shropshire \n(et. al, 1997) suggested that the perceived lack of importance of physical education \nand sporting extra-curricular activities in comparison to other assessed subjects could \nalso result in low participation rates in extra-curricular activities. This accentuates the \nimportance of curriculum opportunities in physical education as the only route for \nmany Muslim girls to have access to exercise (De Knop et al 1996).  \n Some Greek schools lacked extra-curricular activities for girls. The reason, \naccording to the physical education teachers, was lack of sports facilities. In one case \nthe head teacher maintained that the creation of extra-curricular activities was school \npolicy but conceded it depended on the teacher\u2019s commitment. Siraj-Blatchford \n(1993) maintained that school policies in British secondary schools could exclude \nMuslim girls from extra-curricular activities, for example where access is restricted \nthrough type of activity, gender grouping or prohibitive timing of provision.  \n Although there were many compatible facets to comparing these two case \nstudies the age differences of the groups, one group being \u2018in-school\u2019 and the other \n\u2018in University reflecting on school\u2019 was not ideal. It did illuminate a key factor that is \nworthy of further research. The process of \u2018religiosity\u2019 or gradual assumption of \nstronger religious beliefs and values, happened slowly during the years of \nadolescence. As adults the British students were able to reflect with maturity and \n\u2018hindsight\u2019 on changes in their identity and ways in which they coped with these \nduring their education. It would be interesting to explore whether older Greek Muslim \nwomen experienced the same transformation in their adolescent years.  \n 28\nCONCLUSION   \n The two groups of students shared much in their physical education \nexperiences. The subject of physical education has National Curriculum status in both \ncountries, with similar rationales, but different cultures and traditions that shape \nattitudes and values of participants. Students had both positive and negative \nexperiences of the subject. The less formal approach indicated in the Greek pupils\u2019 \nexperiences could contribute to the less problematic experiences encountered. \nAlthough linked by their Muslim identities, differences in the Greek and British \nexperiences are attributed to the different historical and socio-cultural contexts of the \ngroups. The British students were more conscious of the potential tensions at the \ninterface of Islam and the subject.  \nHistorical differences and stages of acculturation for diaspora Muslim \ncommunities in the two countries help to explain contrasts in the lived experience of \nIslam. British Muslims are predominately part of a post 1960\u2019s pattern of economic \nmigration from Pakistan and Bangladesh, striving to find ways to keep their culture \nand religion alive and find a sense of belonging in British society. Ensuring they \nuphold Islamic requirements of dress and behaviour is important to many, as is \nchallenging systems that hinder their struggle for respect of differences, for example \nthe right to have Muslim schools. They are living through a period of \u2018revivalist\u2019 \ninterest in Islam, which is not the same as the global terrorism conducted in the name \nof Islam. Turkish Muslims are descendants of Ottoman conquerors who have lived in \nGreece for over 300 years and have a different experience of Islam. This might be \ndescribed as modernist, assimilating more of the cultures and expectations around \nthem, for example finding mixed-sex physical education in State and Muslim schools \nunproblematic.   \n 29\nThe difference in ages of the respondents in both studies could also account \nfor the less problematic Greek experience. Adolescence is a key period of identity \ntransformation for Muslim women as Islamic requirements and responsibilities which \nshape their dress, interactions and behaviour become important in the lives of those \nwho choose to move in a more religious direction. Individuals will negotiate this \ntransformation in relation to many factors such as their own views on being Muslim in \na non-Muslim country, and the influence of family, community and peers. What they \nlearn from the education process is also crucial in shaping the transformation. The \nempathy between Islam and physical education, in the pursuit of a healthy body, is a \npositive factor that should underpin policies of inclusion that enable Muslim pupils to \nparticipate and experience the benefits of physical activity which they can sustain \nthroughout their lives.  The religious needs of Muslim women can be met by \neducation and sporting institutions and should not be a barrier to participation in such \nan important and beneficial area of life.  \n \nREFERENCES  \nALLEN, C. and NIELSON, J.
