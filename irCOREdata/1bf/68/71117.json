Optical \ninstruments, including a photometer, a real speed TV camera and a digital camera, were monitoring the \nemissions. The emissions that the photometer was designed to mesure were 557.7 nm (OI), 630.0 nm \n(OI) and 427.8 nm (N2+). The energy thresholds of these emissions are approximately 2 eV, 4 eV and \n19 eV, respectively. \n \nIn the natural aurora the blue emission at around 427.8 nm is always dominated by the N2+ 1NG (0,1) \nband. However, there are two weak emission bands lying under this strong emission, namely, the N2 \nVK(4,15) (threshold energy 6 eV) and N2 2P(1,5) (threshold 11 eV). These excitation energies are \nlower than the energy needed to excite N2+ 1NG (0,1) level and therefore could have a stronger \nintensity compared with N2+ 1NG (0,1) in the spectrum of artificial aurora than in natural aurora. \n \nThe auroral photometer of the University of Oulu has been designed for investigating natural aurora. \nThe photometer was equipped with two channels measuring different wavelength bands around 427.8 \nnm. These channels were intended to be used to determine rotational temperature from the ratio of the \nintensities through the channels. However, here we estimate the intensities of the three overlapping \nemission bands instead. \n \nIntroduction \n \nArtificially induced optical emissions by heating ionospheric electrons with powerful radio waves \nsucceeded for the first time in 1970\u2019s at mid-latitudes (Sipler and Biondi, 1972; Gordon and Carlson, \n1974; Haslett et al, 1974; Adeishvili et al., 1978). That was followed by several attempts at high \nlatitudes by the EISCAT Heating facility near Tromso in Norway (Hendriksen et al., 1984; Stubbe et \nal. 1982). However, there was no convincing success until 1999 (Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m et al., 1999; Kosch et al., \n2000; Pedersen and Carlson, 2001) when atomic oxygen O1D (630.0 nm auroral red emission line) and \nO1S (557.7 nm auroral green emission line) were detected. Since then there have been several \nsuccessful measurement campaigns to produce artificial aurora using intense radio waves (e.g. Kosch et \nal., 2002; Rietveld et al., 2003). \n \nDuring the November 2001 campaign (Kosch et al., 2004) at EISCAT, the blue emission was also \nobserved for the first time. Initially, this was interpreted as 427.8 nm, N2+ 1NG(0,1) as expected for \nnatural aurora. The oxygen O1D and O1S states are excited by relatively low energy electrons (1.96 eV \nand 4.17 eV, respectively) (Vallance Jones 1974) and they are expected to be seen in the spectrum of \n 2\nartificial aurora (Haslett et al. 1974). The N2+ 1NG blue emission needs an excitation energy of 18.6 eV \n(Lofthus and Krupenie,1977; Itikawa et al., 1986) making it difficult to understand how considerable \namounts of nitrogen molecules could be excited to this state. \n \n \nInstrumentation and experiment \n \nThe heating experiment was performed at the EISCAT site (69.58 N, 19.22 E) near Tromso in Norway. \nThe experiment was part of a UK\/GE EISCAT measurement campaign, which had as an objective to \nproduce artificially induced auroral emissions using powerful radio waves to input energy into the \nionosphere. The radio wave was transmitted in O-mode from the EISCAT site using the Heating \nfacility. Different cycles and antenna directions were used (Kosch et al., 2004) but in this paper only \nthe 2 min on \u2013 2 min off cycle is investigated. The transmitter antenna was pointed toward 9o south of \nzenith. The effective radiated power was 550 MW and the frequency was 5.423 MHz. \n \nThe ionospheric background conditions were monitored using a digital ionosonde and the EISCAT \nUHF radar (Ashrafi et al., 2004). The Finnish optical instrumentation at the EISCAT site, as well as a \nsupporting station at Kilpisj\u00e4rvi (69.02 N, 20.86 E), consisted of an auroral photometer, a digital \nauroral camera. At the EISCAT site also an image intensified real time camera for VHS video \nrecordings was used. \n \nThe photometer at the EISCAT site had five channels for different wavelengths. Two of the channels \nwere reserved for the nitrogen blue emission and the remaining three were 630.0 nm, 557.7 nm and \n486.1 nm (proton precipitation). The photometer specifications are shown in Table 1. The photometer \nwas scanning across a predetermined angle interval (about 50 to 90 degrees elevation angle south) \naround the heated volume, but during the time of interest it was stopped, pointing directly at the \nluminous area. The integration time was 0.4 s and the background was measured every 32 minutes. \n \nTable 1. The photometer parameters. Channels 3b and 4b are created from channels 3a and 4a by tilting \ninterference filters during the background measurement. P-peak, background, R-peak and R-tail for the \nblue channels refer to the filter positions shown in figure 3. \n \nChannel Name Wavelength (nm) FWHM (nm) FOV (\u00ba) \n1 Proton 486.1 1.26 2 \n2 Red 630.0 1.58 0.6 \n3a Blue, P-peak 427.8 1.24 0.6 \n3b Blue, background 429.2 1.21 0.6 \n4a Blue, R-peak 427.1 0.63 0.6 \n4b Blue, R-tail 425.7 0.88 0.6 \n5 Green 557.7 1.18 0.6 \n \n 3\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements \n \nThe photometer was designed for determining rotational temperatures from the fine structure of the N2+ \n1NG(0,1) band. This is a molecular emission band, where the rotational emission lines result from \ntransitions from different rotational energy states. The initial electronic-vibrational state is N2+ B2\u03a3u+ \n(\u03bd=0) and the final state is N2+ X1\u03a3g+ (\u03bd=1). The populations of the rotational states follow the rule \nN(K\u2019\u2019)=N0 exp(K\u2019\u2019(K\u2019\u2019+1)\/kT), where N0 is total number of N2+ molecules, K\u2019\u2019 is the rotational \nnumber of the upper level, k is Bolzmann\u2019s constant and T is temperature of the ambient neutral gas in \nthermal equilibrium (Vallance Jones, 1974). The neutral gas can be expected to keep its thermal \ncharacteristic condition for several minutes while the plasma is heated by the radio waves under the \nionospheric conditions prevailing at 230 km (Gurevich, 1978). \n \nThe N2 population distribution changes with temperature. The shape of the resulting emission band is \ntemperature dependent as well. This dependence has been used to determine the temperature of the \nemitting gas volume by recognizing the shape of the emission band from photometer data. For \ndetermining rotational temperature with a photometer more than one channel is needed. In this case \nthere were two channels (see figure 2), with one band on the R-branch and the other on the P-branch of \nthe N2+ 1NG(0,1) band. As the shape of the band changes with the temperature of the emitting gas, it is \npossible to interpret the ratio of the intensities of these two channels as the temperature of the emitting \ngas (Hunten et al., 1963). In this case the ratio of R-Peak\/P-Peak intensities would vary between 0.27 \nand 0.33 when temperature goes from 700 to 1500 K, as shown in fig. 1. \n 4\n \nFigure 1. The calculated intensity ratio R-peak\/P-peak for N2+ 1NG (0,1) emission band as a function \nof neutral gas temperature. \n \nThe artificially stimulated blue emission was detected at various times during the evening of 12 Nov \n2001 from Tromso, for the first time ever at high latitudes. The nitrogen emission was especially \nprominent from 16:30 to 17:00 UT (see Fig. 2), when the photometer scan was stopped with the \ninstrument pointing directly toward the emission region. This time interval was chosen for the present \nstudy. During the time of interest there are eight full heating cycles clearly visible in the photometer \ndata from Tromso, as shown in figure 2. All the photometer channels show a clear signal (except for \n481.6 nm). The numbers from 1 to 8 denote the cycles. The last cycle (number 9) is only partly \nresolved. \n \n \n 5\n \nFigure 2. The top panel shows calibrated optical intensities for the blue emissions. The upper and lower \ncurves show photometer channels 3a (P-Peak) and 4a (R-Peak), respectively. The bottom panel shows \ncalibrated optical intensities for 630 (upper curve) and 557.7 nm (lower curve). The heater on periods \nhave been denoted with numbers from 1 to 9. The arrow shows the time at which the background \nmeasurement was taken. The integration time for the measurements was 0.4 seconds. The data have \nbeen averaged over 20 data points for the plot. \n \n \n \nThe cycles have been handled individually so that for both channels the intensity has been integrated \nthroughout the whole on-phase of each cycle to get the signal and throughout the whole off-phase to \nget the background. The integrated intensities through the R-filter have been divided by the integrated \nintensities through the P-filter to get the background-subtracted intensity ratios. The photometer \nintensities and their ratios are presented in table 2. \n \nTable 2. Background-subtracted calibrated intensities (Rayleighs) through the P-peak and R-peak \nchannels and ratios of these intensities during heating-on periods. \n \n 6\nPeriod number P-Peak R-Peak Ratio \n1 7.0  5.3  0.74 \n2 11.9  5.8  0.48 \n3 7.5  4.7  0.63 \n4 6.6  3.7  0.57 \n5 11.2  6.6  0.59 \n6 10.6  6.4  0.60 \n7 9.2  6.6  0.72 \n8 11.2  6.6  0.59 \n9 5.5  2.8  0.51 \n \n \nResults \n \nTable 2 shows that the intensities vary from 5.5 to 11.9 Rayleighs in the P-peak channel and from 2.8 \nto 6.6 Rayleighs in the R-peak channel with averages of 9.0 and 5.4 Rayleighs, respectively. For the \nbackground measurement, the P-peak filter shifts to the background position at a longer wavelength    \n(channel 3b in table 1) and the R-peak filter to the R-tail position at a shorter wavelength (channel 4b in \ntable 1) by (un)tilting the relevant filter (Kaila, 2003). This means that during the background \nmeasurement the photometer is using channels 3b and 4b instead of channels 3a and 4a. This \nmeasurement is intended to measure background light level in normal auroral studies. Now channel 3b \n(filter P-background) would be measuring part of the N2 VK(4,15) emission band (see fig. 3). \n \nDuring the background measurement in heating period four (seen in figure 2 as a sudden intensity \nreduction in the middle of the period 4, marked with an arrow), the intensity in the R-tail channel is 75 \n% of the R-peak intensity. The intensity in the background channel of the P-peak is effectively equal to \nthe background level. Comparing the emission ratios in table 2 to calculated values shown in fig. 1, \nwhich range from 0.27 at 600 K to 0.45 at 200 K at the lower temperatures and to 0.32 at 1400 K at the \nhigher temperatures, the ratio never reaches 0.5 even at unrealistically high temperatures. It is obvious \nthat there is something not in order with the N2+ 1NG(0,1) emission. The measured ratios are not even \non the scale of the expected temperature range. A ratio of 0.27 \u2013 0.33 is expected around the probable \nneutral gas temperatures of 700-1500 K. Hence, it is not possible to determine temperature from this \ndata. This means that the blue emission cannot originate purely from the N2+ 1NG(0,1) band! \n \nThe most likely explanation for the unexpected intensity ratio R-peak\/P-peak would be the existence of \nother atomic or molecular emissions in this exceptional condition, i.e. for ionospheric heating. There \nare two other emissions in the same wavelength region as the N2+ 1NG (0,1) band. They are the \nmolecular nitrogen bands N2 VK(4,15) and N2 2P(1,5) having threshold energies of ~6 eV and ~11 eV, \nrespectively. Although these energies are high compared to the atomic oxygen excitation energies, \nartificial optical emissions at 777.4 nm (Djuth et al., 2004), corresponding to ~11 eV, and 844.6 nm \n 7\n(Gustavsson et al., 2004) corresponding to ~9 eV have been reported. Hence, it is entirely possible the \nN2 VK(4,15) and N2 2P(1,5) bands can be stimulated. The three N2 emission bands lie in the same \nwavelength region mixed together and are normally not resolved in photometer data. These are shown \nin fig. 3 along with the filter transmission curves for photometer channels 3 and 4. In natural aurora the \nN2+ 1NG(0,1) emission dominates. If there were more photometer channels with narrow band filters \nmeasuring in the wavelength range of interest, it would be possible to estimate relative intensities of \nthese overlaying nitrogen bands. Likewise, a spectrograph would be able to resolve the different \ncontributions. \n \nThe available photometer data was used to estimate the intensities of the N2+ 1NG(0,1), N2 VK(4,15) \nand N2 2P(1,5) bands using a reasonable estimate of the neutral gas temperature. The intensity ratios \n(R-Peak\/P-Peak) as a function of temperature were calculated for all of these emission bands. The \noxygen 557.7 and 630 nm emissions occur at a height of 215 \u2013 235 km (Kosch et al., 2004), decreasing \nin altitude during each heater cycle. The atmospheric neutral temperature is close to 1100 K in this \nheight range according to the MSIS model, which is consistent with the ion temperature measured by \nEISCAT. From the intensity ratio calculations we know that 1100 K corresponds to a ratio of 0.30 for \nN2+ 1NG(0,1), 1.00 for N2 VK(4,15) and 2.75 for N2 2P(1,5). The measured intensity ratios can be \nreconstructed if the intensity of N2 2P (1,5) is about 27% higher than the intensity of N2+ 1NG (0,1) \nwhile the N2 VK (4,15) intensity is close to zero. We have estimated the photometer measurement error \nfrom the background measurement taken in cycle 4 to be 1.5 R. Thus the intensity of N2 VK(4,15) \ncannot be more than this.  \nIf we assume the maximum N2 VK(4,15) through the P-peak filter is 1.5 R, which means the intensity \nis 2.3 R for whole band, we calculate the intensities of other two bands to be 13.5 R for the N2 2P(1,5) \nand 14.8 R for the N2+ 1NG(0,1) emission band. These results are shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3.

The three rotational emission bands N2+ 1NG(0,1), top panel, N2 2P(1,5), middle panel, and \nN2 VK(4,15), bottom panel,  together with the filter transmission curves. The filters are named \naccording to the position of the peaks of their transmission curves compared to the 1NG-band. The \nfilter curves are the same in all panels, but they have been named in the uppermost panel only. \n \n \nConclusions and discussion \n \nThe initial aim of the analysis was to determine height of the blue emission in the artificial aurora by \nusing the rotational temperature method. Unfortunately, the blue emission can not be triangulated \nbecause there is data from just one station on 12\/11\/2001 for these wavelengths. However, the intensity \nratios R-peak\/P-peak were unrealistically high. They were first thought to represent an extremely high \ntemperature of the emitting neutral gas volume, but the measured intensity ratios are in fact not realistic \nat all for any temperature. In addition, Ashrafi et al. (2004) have estimated the electron temperature \nmaximum to be <6000 K during this experiment, thereby limiting the maximum possible neutral gas \ntemperature. \n \nWe have ruled out other possible explanations such as instrumentation malfunction, errors in \ncalibration or errors in the emission band calculations. Using triangulation, the altitude of the green and \n 9\nred line oxygen emissions were estimated to be 210 \u2013 215 km by one of us (K. Kaila), consistent with \nthe steady state altitude estimate by Kosch et al. (2004). The radio wave reflection height estimated \nfrom dynasonde and EISCAT data is 220 \u2013 235  km. (Kosch et al. 2004). These heights do not give the \naltitude of the blue emission, but it is reasonable to assume that all the emissions arise quite close to \neach other. Thus we can also rule out resonant scattering caused by sunlit, as the sun\u2019s shadow was \nalready at a height of 290 km at 16:30 UT. \n \nA reasonable candidate for interfering with the normal processes in the heated gas volume is resonance \nin the transfer of momentum from the electrons to the molecules. This may happen for low energy \nelectrons in inelastic collisions with the N2 molecules, resulting in an excess population of the lowest \nrotational states. This effect may be visible when the bombarding electrons have energies close to the \nthreshold energy, as in the case of artificial aurora. However, the error in the temperature measurement \nshould be of the order of 50 K at a temperature of 300 K (Culp and Stair, 1967) measured using a \nspectrometer. This effect is too small to explain the observed results. \n \nWe conclude that the blue emission is dominated by N2+ 1NG(0,1), which has an excitation threshold \nof ~19 eV and N2 2P(1,5), with an excitation threshold of ~11 eV. The blue emission probably also \nincludes a small contribution from N2 VK(4,15), with an excitation threshold of ~6 eV. The presence of \nthe blue emission clearly indicates the non-thermal nature of the heated electron population. This \nstrongly suggests that non-linear electron acceleration processes are present in the turbulent plasma, \nconsistent with the finding of Ashrafi et al. (2004) and Kosch et al. (2004) using EISCAT radar data. \n \n \nAcknowledgements: \n \nThe EISCAT facilities are funded by research organisations from Finland, France, Germany, Japan, \nNorway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  \n \n \nReferences: \n \n \nAdeishvili, T.G., A.V.
