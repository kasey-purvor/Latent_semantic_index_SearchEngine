To our \nknowledge this is the first reported study looking at this association. \n \n \n \n \n \nKeywords:  breast cancer; late radiation damage; cardiovascular disease; telangiectasiae \n \n3 \n \nIntroduction \nVirtually all breast cancer patients treated with breast conservation, and patients at high risk of \nrecurrence following mastectomy, receive radiotherapy. The benefits of radiation therapy are not \nhowever complication-free. There is a wide spectrum of normal-tissue reactions, and as life \nexpectancy of cancer patients improves, these are increasingly of clinical importance. Tissue toxicity \nmay range from asymptomatic changes in tissue structure and function, to severe cosmetic \ndisfigurement and life-altering changes in organ function (Bentzen et al., 2003). The effects of \nradiotherapy can be divided into early\/acute or late, depending on whether they occur within or \nafter 90 days following radiation treatment (van der Kogel, 1993).  Fibrosis, telangiectasiae and \natrophy are examples of common late, normal-tissue manifestations (O'Sullivan and Levin, 2003). \nRadiotherapy substantially reduces the risk of local recurrence after surgery, with a modest \nreduction in cancer mortality offset by an increase in contralateral breast cancer and cardiac disease, \nwhich is more marked in older trials. Many of the techniques used involved some unavoidable \nirradiation of the heart leading to a 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] 13-41%) increase in mortality \nfrom heart disease and reducing the beneficial effect of radiotherapy on overall survival (Clarke et \nal., 2005). The cardiovascular mortality risk in patients receiving radiotherapy for left-sided breast \ncancer tends  to become apparent after more than 10 years of follow-up (Darby et al., 2003). It \nseems that this risk is side and technique specific and is particularly associated with irradiation of the \ninternal mammary nodes (HR=1.9, 95%CI 1.0-3.3) (Paszat et al., 2007). Evidence also exists of a \nsignificant increase in the relative risk for myocardial infarction (MI) for women who received \nadjuvant radiotherapy for left-sided compared to right-sided lesions (Paszat et al., 1998; Rutqvist \nand Johansson, 1990). All cardiac structures including the pericardium, myocardium, valves, \nconduction system, and coronary arteries are amenable to radiation damage and a common \npathophysiologic pathway appears to be that of microcirculatory damage (with the exception of \nvalvular disease as valves are avascular) (Stewart et al., 1995).  \n4 \n \nMore recently, a greater number of patients received treatment to the intact breast without \nparasternal internal mammary node irradiation, which reduces the cardiac irradiated volume. \nAlthough the cardiac dose from left-tangential radiotherapy has also decreased considerably over \nthe last few decades, part of the heart still receives >20Gy for approximately half of those with left-\nsided tumours. The cardiac dose for right-sided patients is generally from scattered irradiation alone \n(Taylor et al., 2008).    \nA wide range of additional risk factors have been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular \nmorbidity and mortality following breast cancer radiotherapy. These include irradiated heart volume \n(Gyenes et al., 1997), total radiation dose (Gyenes et al., 1998) and  fractionation (Paszat et al., \n1999) although the latter has not been consistently shown (Marhin et al., 2007; Nilsson et al., 2009). \nThere seems to be an interaction between radiation-related cardiac damage and cardiotoxic drugs \nsuch as anthracyclines (Bonneterre et al., 2004), whereas acute cardiotoxicity following combination \nof left-sided internal mammary chain irradiation and concurrent trastuzumab use has not been \nclearly shown (Belkacemi et al., 2008; Shaffer et al., 2009). A low overall incidence of cardiovascular \nadverse effects has also been shown with the use of aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen (Mouridsen \net al., 2007). In terms of coexisting risk factors for developing radiation-induced heart disease \n(RIHD), there is a significant interaction between pre-existing hypertension, left-breast irradiation \nand the development of coronary artery disease (Harris et al., 2006).  \n \nIn an attempt to associate genotypes with phenotypes, our group examined the relationship \nbetween late normal-tissue radiation injury in breast cancer patients, early acute radiation reactions \nand genotype (Giotopoulos et al., 2007). Patients were genotyped at functional single nucleotide \npolymorphisms (SNPs) in various candidate genes. As the power of genetic studies investigating \ngenotype-phenotype correlations is absolutely dependent on the precise definition of the \nphenotype, the Late Effects of Normal Tissue-Subjective Objective Management Analytical (LENT-\nSOMA) scale was used to evaluate radiation injury (Pavy et al., 1995). This scale provides both \n5 \n \nsubjective and objective analyses and a detailed and specific description of the nature (phenotype) \nand severity of the injury\/-ies that are individually scored. Results showed that homozygosity (TT) for \nthe TGFb1 (C-509T) gene promoter polymorphism confers a 15-fold increased risk of fibrosis \nfollowing radiotherapy (P=3.10-6) compared with (CC) homozygotes, thus confirming previous \nindependent analyses (Andreassen et al., 2005; Quarmby et al., 2003). Additionally, a 15Gy electron \nboost and\/or the inheritance of X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) (R399Q) SNP \ncontributed to the risk of telangiectasiae. These data suggested distinct underlying genetic and \nradiobiological pathways responsible for these side-effects. \n \nBased on data from our previous study cohort, we hypothesised a potential association between the \npresence of cutaneous telangiectasiae, as a late-normal tissue injury following radiotherapy for \nbreast cancer and an increase in the risk for cardiovascular disease.  \n \n \nMaterials and methods \n \nPatients and methods: \nThis report follows a previous study published by this group (Giotopoulos et al., 2007). The study had \nbeen undertaken with the participation of patients attending the breast cancer clinics in Leicester \nRoyal Infirmary and Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UK. The Oncology Department provides services for \na population of just under a million, seeing over 3500 new cases per year of which 750 are newly \ndiagnosed patients with breast cancer. All patients with breast cancer having completed adjuvant \ntreatment are followed-up annually for a minimum of 5 years.    \nTumour-free breast cancer patients were sequentially recruited via these breast cancer clinics. A \ntotal of 153 patients gave written informed consent before entry into the study, and underwent an \nexamination of the affected area and the recognised features of late radiation effects were scored \nby the SOMA scale using sight and\/or by palpation. Of these, fully completed questionnaires were \nobtained for the majority of patients (n=149) (Figure I). All were treated more than four years \n6 \n \npreviously (median follow-up from time of treatment for entire group was 6.1 years). Radiotherapy \n(6MV photons) was given either after mastectomy or wide local excision (WLE) using tangential \nopposed fields. Initial surgery was either a wide local excision with nodal sampling\/clearance (n=101) \nor mastectomy (n=45) plus axillary node dissection. Three patients had inoperable tumours.  \nA variety of radiotherapy dose-fractionation schedules were used (see table I). Two patients \ndiscontinued treatment early due to unexpected severe acute reactions. All patients who received \nan electron boost had a dose of 15 Gy in five fractions in 1 week using 8\u201312 MeV electrons to the \ntumour bed. The irradiated area on these patients was similar (between 36 and 80 cm2). Patients \nwere asked about potential radiosensitising co-morbid diseases such as diabetes or collagen vascular \ndisorders. They also completed a questionnaire regarding cardiac symptoms and diagnoses.  \n \nCardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined by symptoms and corresponding investigations that \ndemonstrated an abnormality in cardiac function or structure. Vascular disease such as hypertension \nwas not part of the CVD definition although it was considered as a risk factor for it. In this definition \nwe included coronary artery disease, atrial or ventricular dilatation, arrhythmias and congestive \ncardiac failure. We excluded congenital heart disease or acquired\/secondary structural disease. \nPatients with known congenital (cardiac shunts, previous corrective surgery or persisting structural \nabnormalities such as valvular heart disease) or acquired\/secondary structural heart disease \n(rheumatic valve disease, mixed aortic valve disease, CABG) prior to radiotherapy were excluded \nfrom the current analysis following a detailed review of all available medical information by a \nConsultant Cardiologist (GPM). Cardiovascular symptoms\/diagnoses were checked for all recruited \npatients using a variety of information systems within University Hospitals Leicester, which provide \nall secondary care assessment of patients with known or suspected cardiac disease within \nLeicestershire. Patients who had been investigated with an echocardiogram were highlighted within \nthe Cardiac Investigations\u2019 own record system, and the report obtained. The online radiology reports \nsystem was screened to highlight any other relevant imaging such as cardiac perfusion scans or \n7 \n \ncoronary angiography. In addition, all patient records on the HISS (Hospital Information Support \nSystem) medical records\/clinical coding system were examined to check for clinical codes relating to \ncardiac diagnoses. All of the medical symptoms reported in oncology follow-up appointments were \nreviewed using the electronic patient record system (MAISY \u2013 Compucorp UK). Death certificates of \ndeceased patients were obtained to check for causes of death related to cardiac damage. Finally, any \npatient with a positive finding in any of these modalities was investigated further with a full review \nof their written medical records.  \nA total of fifteen patients with cardiac disease requiring referral or investigations in secondary or \ntertiary care and who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were identified. Six patients were excluded on \nthe basis of having pre-existing cardiac disease (Figure II). Two of these patients received left- and \nfour received right-sided radiotherapy. Reasons for exclusion included: cardiomegaly and pulmonary \ncongestion prior to radiotherapy treatment (one patient), CABG pre-radiotherapy treatment (one \npatient), rheumatic valve disease (one patient) and congenital heart disease (three patients). \n \nTo assess whether the CVD patients (n=9) had excessive heart tissue irradiated, simulator planning \nfilms from all the patients treated with left-sided radiotherapy were reviewed by three investigators \n(RPS, JM, GAT).  Accurately interpretable information from planning films could only be obtained for \n60 of the 71 left-sided patients.  Of these, 42 patients had some cardiac outline within the tangential \nfield (defined as \u2018in-field\u2019) and 18 did not. The heart in right-sided patients was automatically \nregarded as \u2018out-of treatment field\u2019 (n=78) thus giving an \u2018out-of-field\u2019 denominator of 96 and a total \nfor the group of 138. The maximum heart distance (MHD) was measured as a proxy for irradiated \nvolume with established level of agreement. The MHD was measured between the posterior \n(mediolateral) field border to the most distant heart contour in the beam\u2019s-eye view of a tangential \ntreatment beam.   \n8 \n \nBased on available information, the denominator slightly differed between analysis groups. \nTreatment side information was available for 149 patients. The presence or absence of \ntelangiectasiae was recorded for 149 patients; however as 12 patients with a telangiectasia score of \n1 were excluded in an attempt to reduce inter-examiner bias, the analysis denominator became 137.  \n \nStatistical analysis: The Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to examine the relationship between the various \nvariables as well as the relationship between phenotype and genotype. To test whether \nhypertension was an independent risk factor, binary logistic regression was used. The SPSS 16.0 \n(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software package was used for the analysis.  \nGenotyping: A full description of the genotyping methods is included in our previous paper \n(Giotopoulos et al., 2007). \n \nResults \nOf the patients with available data (n=149), 6% (9\/149) were identified as having cardiovascular \ndisease, between 3 and 12 years post-radiotherapy (mean=6.6 years). Radiotherapy was given \nfollowing wide local excision (6\/9), mastectomy (2\/9) or biopsy (1\/9). The latter patient had an \ninoperable tumour.  \nOf the nine CVD patients (n=9), three had no pre-existing conditions or risk factors for cardiovascular \ndisease. Four patients had a history of hypertension, and three had received anthracycline-based \nchemotherapy prior to radiation treatment (Table II). One of the patients had a reported history of \nmyocardial infarction seven years pre-radiotherapy treatment. There was no other confirmation of \nthis patient\u2019s MI apart from a single entry in the medical records. As it may be particularly important \nto assess the level of deterioration in patients with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease rather than \n9 \n \nonly include those who developed evidence of cardiac related symptoms post radiotherapy, we \ndecided to include this patient in our analysis. \nAll CVD patients had received left-sided radiotherapy (9\/71) at a mean age of 65 years, and in all but \none (8\/9) the heart was within the tangential breast field (mean MHD=1.9 cm, median=0.56 and \nrange 0-3.5cm). The following dose fractionation regimes were used: Seven patients received 45Gy \nin 20 fractions and two 50Gy in 25 fractions.  \nThe comparison between the CVD patient cohort in whom the heart was within the radiation \ntreatment field to the \u2018out-of-field group\u2019 recorded an OR of 22.3 (95% CI 2.6 - 185.3) (Table III). By \nmeasuring the MHD we had the advantage of showing that the effects of radiation are more likely to \nbe due to direct damage to the heart rather than secondary to scattered irradiation. To test whether \nMHD was a significant predictor of CVD in left-sided patients, we carried out binary logistic \nregression which demonstrated that MHD shows borderline significance (P=0.056). There was no \nassociation between the severity of telangiectasiae and MHD in the CVD patient cohort (data not \nshown).  \nFive CVD patients who had been treated with wide local excision received a 15Gy boost (Table II). As \nshown previously (Giotopoulos et al., 2007), the use of electron boost was associated with a higher \nrisk of telangiectasiae (Table IV). Dose per fraction (2 versus >2Gy) was not a predictor for the \ndevelopment of CVD (data not shown). Additionally, our analysis did not show an association \nbetween electron boost and the development of cardiovascular disease as this should not give \nsignificant additional dose to the heart (Table V). Although numbers limit the conclusions, there is \nsome preliminary evidence that the predictive value of telangiectasiae is higher in women not \nreceiving a boost (data not shown). The use of electron boost and hypofractionation was equal in \nleft versus right patients (Table VI).  \nA number of factors may influence the risk and severity of late, normal-tissue damage including \nchemotherapy or hormone therapy. Analysis of the number of patients, who received anthracycline-\nbased adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, revealed that this was not a significant \n10 \n \npredictor for CVD in our data. There was also no association between the use of adjuvant hormone \ntherapy (Tamoxifen) and the development of CVD (data not shown). \n \nRight versus left-sided disease and CVD \nA total of 149 patients were included in this group. All the identified patients with cardiovascular \ndisease (9\/9) had received radiation treatment to the left side. When the left-sided cohort was \ncompared to the right-sided one (Table III), a statistically significant difference in the risk for CVD \nwas recorded (P=0.001; Fisher\u2019s exact test). When we carried out the exact same comparison \nincluding all documented CVD patients (without excluding patients with previous CVD), the \nassociation remained significant (11 of 71 left-sided vs 4 of 78 right-sided patients; P=0.03).  \n \nTelangiectasiae and CVD \nPresence or absence of telangiectasiae was documented for 149 patients. SOMA scores for \ntelangiectasiae were analysed by comparing affected (SOMA scores 2\u20133) and unaffected patients \n(SOMA score 0). As in the previous study, SOMA scores of 1 (subtle, examiner-dependent changes), \nwere excluded from analysis to try and reduce inter-examiner bias. In this cohort 12 patients had a \ntelangiectasiae score of 1 (denominator used in the analysis n=137). Thirty-two patients developed \ntelangiectasiae SOMA score >1, of which 17 received right and 15 left-sided breast irradiation. Five \nout of the thirty-two (15.6%) patients with telangiectasiae developed CVD, thus recording an OR of \n6.3 (95% CI 1.4 \u2013 28.0) when compared to 3 out of 105 (2.9%) patients with CVD in the non-\ntelangiectasiae group (Table III).  \nWhen we compared excluded plus included CVD patients (without excluding any patients on the \nbasis of pre-existing structural or functional cardiac disease) who developed telangiectasiae (SOMA \nscore > 1) (9\/32), to the non-telangiectasiae group (6\/105), this recorded an OR of 6.4 (95% CI 2.1-\n19.9) and a P-value of 0.004 (Fisher\u2019s exact test). \n \n11 \n \nHypertension, smoking, diabetes and CVD \nPre-existing hypertension was reported in four of the five patients with CVD and significant \ntelangiectasiae (SOMA >1) though this was not found to be an independent risk factor. To test this \nfurther, binary logistic regression was performed. The model contained hypertension, laterality and \ntelangiectasia score. The model as a whole explained between 18.8 and 30% of the variance in risk \nfor CVD and correctly classified 80.5% of cases. Telangiectasia score was the only variable that made \na statistically significant contribution to the model recording an OR of 6.2 (95% CI 1.1-36.2). Of the \nentire cohort, 21% of the patients were current or ex-smokers. None of the patients who developed \nCVD were smokers. There was also no association between a pre-existing history of diabetes and the \ndevelopment of CVD.  \n \nGenotype-phenotype correlations \nIn the current analysis, no association was observed between CVD and the inheritance of alleles of \nthe X-ray repair cross-complementing 1, XRCC1 (R399Q)SNP, previously linked to radiation-induced \ntelangiectasiae, the fibrosis-associated TGFb1 (C-509T) gene promoter polymorphism (Giotopoulos \net al., 2007) or the eNOS (E298D) SNP that confers a weak protective effect against radiotherapy-\ninduced telangiectasiae (Giotopoulos et al., 2008). \n \nDiscussion: \nAlthough radiotherapy has significantly increased the overall long-term survival of breast cancer \npatients (Clarke et al., 2005), normal-tissue radiation injury is increasingly becoming a factor that \nneeds to be taken into account particularly as it can affect quality of life. In everyday clinical practice, \nthere has also been increasing difficulty in estimating and counselling patients about the potential \nadverse effects of radiation therapy and in particular their long-term risk of RIHD. In an attempt to \nclarify some of these issues and to assess whether there may be ways in identifying such high risk \npatients, we analysed data from our cohort of patients. The cardiac disease was confirmed using a \n12 \n \nvariety of lines of enquiry to reduce the possibility of failing to identify patients with such diagnoses. \nAlthough we cannot say with certainty that no new cardiovascular diagnoses were missed, there \nshould be no bias towards patients with left- and right-sided radiotherapy. Our observations indicate \na statistically significant association between the long-term risk for CVD and the presence of \ncutaneous telangiectasiae in this cohort.  \n \nRIHD is thought to result from both micro- and macrovasculature damage (Corn et al., 1990). The \ndamage to the microvascular component is initiated by endothelial cell damage within cardiac \nstructures. This is followed by ischaemia which seems to be secondary to capillary swelling and \nprogressive obstruction of the vessel lumen. The damaged area is then replaced by fibrous tissue. \nMacrovascular damage results from injury to larger vessels, leading to exacerbation of \natherosclerotic lesion formation (Seddon et al., 2002). The most important functional consequence \nis diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis which contributes primarily to diastolic dysfunction \n(Gagliardi et al., 2001). In our analysis, we did not observe an association between the common \nTGFb1 (C-509T) gene promoter polymorphism, known to significantly increase the risk for radiation-\ninduced fibrosis, and CVD. It is, however, possible that other gene(s) in the same or different \nbiological pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis. A \nrecent study by Kuiper et al. (2008) provides evidence for a link between vascular damage and \nfibrosis. It was noted that a shift in the balance between levels of the pro-angiogenic vascular \nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the pro-inflammatory connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) \ncould explain the switch from angiogenesis to fibrosis in patients with proliferative retinopathy. \n \nFor both left- and right-sided radiotherapy and with the use of either tangential fields or intensity-\nmodulated radiation therapy (IMRT), most of the heart receives >1Gy dose from scattered \nirradiation (Li et al., 2000). This low-dose exposure of the whole heart may contribute to the cardiac \ndamage leading to increase in cardiac mortality. Survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and \n13 \n \nNagasaki also showed evidence for this. They had received a mean uniform single cardiac dose of \n4Gy or less and within this cohort subsequent studies showed excess mortality from cardiac disease \n(Preston et al., 2003). Another example is in men who have received treatment for germ-cell \ntumours. Any chemotherapy or, radiotherapy to the para-aortic nodes or mediastinum in these \nindividuals, increases their cardiovascular morbidity (van den Belt-Dusebout et al., 2006).  \nIt is interesting to note that in our cohort the CVD morbidity was identified following left-sided \nirradiation only, in spite of cardiac dose from treatment to the right side. Given the prevalence of \nCVD in a population with a mean age of 65 years, this finding was surprising as it is not entirely \nexpected that only left-sided patients would have developed post-radiotherapy CVD, unless solely \nattributable to radiation, which seems unlikely. This may reflect a relatively small cohort.  \nWhen we compared well established pre-existing cardiac disease risk factors in left versus right-\nsided patients, no differences were demonstrated on the basis of hypertension or age between the \ntwo groups. Additionally, the majority of the patients who developed CVD and had telangiectasiae \nwere not in fact hypertensive. Smoking was slightly more common in right-sided patients (Table VII). \nOur data could reflect that the presence of telangiectasiae might be a better predictor for the \ndevelopment of cardiac disease than traditional cardiovascular risk factors and that the mechanism \nprecipitating this is different to that of atherosclerosis.  \n \nA number of additional factors may influence the risk and severity of late normal tissue damage. \nThese include, but are not limited to: the size and shape of the breast\/ chest wall, the type of \nsurgery and any complications, radiotherapy dose, fractionation and time, adjuvant chemotherapy, \nwhether the patient had a severe, early acute reaction and whether the individual patient was \ngenetically predisposed. The START (Standardisation of Breast radiotherapy) B trial has recently \nshown that hypofractionating regimes may not necessarily increase late effects (Bentzen et al., \n2008). Chemotherapy may increase late effects (Fiets et al., 2003), particularly anthracycline-\ncontaining regimens but we did not find a significant association between the two in our current \n14 \n \ncohort. There was also no association between the use of adjuvant hormone therapy (Tamoxifen) \nand the development of CVD. \n \nTelangiectasiae can develop six months to many years following the completion of radiotherapy and \noccur most often in the boost area or the infra-mammary fold. Telangiectasiae are focal dilatations \nof post-capillary venules mainly, but also occasionally of the capillaries and arterioles of the \nsubpapillary plexus (Requena and Sangueza, 1997). They occur in an atrophic dermis under a thinned \nepidermis and present as areas of reddish discolouration (Archambeau et al., 1995). The \nmechanisms by which telangiectasiae develop, are not fully understood but they seem to be both \ngenetically and mechanistically-predetermined. Their severity is influenced by both treatment- and \npatient-related factors. There are some fundamental radiobiological data describing macroscopic \nand histological effects of chronic radiation damage using animal models, mainly rats (Trott, 1984). \nThe primary effect of radiation is DNA damage and there is evidence that the most vulnerable cells \nare endothelial. Models of telangiectasiae formation show that impaired tissue microcirculation \ndrainage leads to stasis in the collecting venules which results in the expansion of capillaries and \nvenules, characteristic of telangiectasiae. In our analysis, we observed a statistically significant \nassociation between the long-term risk for cardiovascular disease and the presence of cutaneous \ntelangiectasiae (Table III).  Interestingly, the significance of this correlation was maintained and \nbecame even greater when we included all the identified CVD patients with no exclusions. Although \ntelangiectasiae in most cases are only unsightly, our findings could suggest a novel use as a marker \nand a predictor of future cardiac-related complications. The recognition of this association, early, \nmay allow the clinician to modify the other cardiac risk factors in these patients and therefore \ndecrease their risk of significant cardiac events. It could also have a role as a screening tool for \nearlier diagnosis and treatment in this setting.  \n \n15 \n \nPrevious studies have shown potential common genetic and radiobiological pathways involved in the \ndevelopment of late, normal-tissue complications following radiotherapy (Andreassen et al., 2005; \nGiotopoulos et al., 2007; Quarmby et al., 2003). A potential genotypic association between \ncutaneous telangiectasiae and the development of RIHD would be intriguing as it may confer a \nnumber of clinical implications. This would raise the question whether we might be able to identify \npatients who should be recommended to have partial breast irradiation, and\/or IMRT, or offer \ndifferent surgical options such as a mastectomy without radiotherapy.  \n \nOur conclusions are based on a relatively small cohort and therefore these findings need to be \nreplicated. There are a number of potential confounders that we have not been able to assess due to \nthe design of the study including Body Mass Index and a family history of cardiovascular disease. A \npotential problem is that the cohort could have had an unexpected degree of sub-clinical \ncardiovascular disease, though the lack of previously documented CVD events in the group receiving \nright-sided radiotherapy mitigates against this. Although there was close consideration to accurately \ndefine the inclusion criteria for CVD diagnoses, a number of patients with additional cardiovascular \nevents could have been lost to follow-up. The significance of the association between telangiectasiae \nand CVD was, however, maintained even with or without exclusions for previous CVD. A possible \nsource of false association could be an undetected difference between the groups receiving left- or \nright-sided treatment, but in this cohort there was no difference in hypertension, telangiectasiae or \nother variables except CVD. Smoking was slightly more common in right-sided patients \n \nOur data demonstrate a statistically significant association between the development of \ntelangiectasiae as late normal-tissue injury following radiotherapy and the risk for cardiovascular \ndisease. The most parsimonious explanation would be that a propensity for the development of \ntelangiectasiae and CVD are part of a common biological pathway on the basis of a genetically \npredisposed endothelium. If this conclusion is correct, we would expect identification of genes that \n16 \n \nprove the association. Further studies are required to explore the potential mechanisms and \nidentification of individuals at increased risk of RIHD to maintain a reasonable therapeutic benefit for \nradiotherapy in breast cancer. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nWe would like to thank Dr Peter Lacy for reviewing the manuscript and for his helpful comments.
