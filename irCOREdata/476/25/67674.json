On 7 December 1992, a moderate substorm\nwas observed by a variety of satellites and ground-based\ninstruments. Ionospheric flows weremonitored near dusk\nby the Goose Bay HF radar and near midnight by the\nEISCAT radar. The observed flows are compared here\nwith magnetometer observations by the IMAGE array in\nScandinavia and the two Greenland chains, the auroral\ndistribution observed by Freja and the substorm cycle\nobservations by the SABRE radar, the SAMNET mag-\nnetometer array and LANL geosynchronous satellites.\nData from Galileo Earth-encounter II are used to\nestimate the IMF Bz component. The data presented\nshow that the substorm onset electrojet at midnight was\nconfined to closed field lines equatorward of the pre-\nexisting convection reversal boundaries observed in the\ndusk and midnight regions. No evidence of substantial\nclosure of open flux was detected following this substorm\nonset. Indeed the convection reversal boundary on the\nduskside continued to expand equatorward after onset\ndue to the continued presence of strong southward IMF,\nsuch that growth and expansion phase features were\nsimultaneously present. Clear indications of closure of\nopen flux were not observed until a subsequent substorm\nintensification 25 min after the initial onset. After this\ntime, the substorm auroral bulge in the nightside hours\npropagated well poleward of the pre-existing convection\nreversal boundary, and strong flow perturbations were\nobserved by the Goose Bay radar, indicative of flows\ndriven by reconnection in the tail.\nKey words. Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; plasma\nconvection) \u00e1 Magnetospheric physics (storms and\nsubstorms)\n1 Introduction\nThe onset of a magnetospheric substorm, marking the\ntransition from the growth to the expansion phase, is\ndefined as the beginning of the explosive brightening\nand expansion of the aurora. As the Akasofu (1964)\nmodel had only two substorm phases, expansion and\nrecovery, expansion, onset was the first event during a\nsubstorm. With the addition of the growth phase\n(McPherron, 1970) it was recognised that the substorm\ncycle began not at onset, but typically 30\u201360 min earlier\nwhen the rate of dayside flux production increased\n(usually due to a southward turning of the IMF). The\nterm onset was retained for the commencement of the\nauroral and current features described by Akasofu\n(1964), and subsequently became associated with\nthe commencement of the reconnection of open flux in\nthe tail, which closes the open flux accumulated in the\ngrowth phase. The main assumptions of the near-Earth\nneutral line (NENL) substorm model were that the\nonset of near-Earth tail reconnection caused the onset\nof the expansion phase, and that this reconnection rate\nis su\u0081ciently rapid that the plasmoid is pinched o\u0080\nwithin a few minutes such that open lobe flux then\nbegins to be closed (Hones, 1979). More recent evi-\ndence, however, suggests that there may be a significant\ndelay between the expansion phase onset and the\nclosure of open flux. Although Nagai et al. (1998) have\nshown that reconnection generally commences betweenCorrespondence to: N. J. Fox\nAnn. Geophysicae 17, 1369\u20131384 (1999) \u00d3 EGS \u2013 Springer-Verlag 1999\n20\u201330 RE downtail within a few minutes of substorm\nonset, it appears nevertheless that a substantial interval\nmay elapse before the resulting plasmoid is pinched o\u0080\nand open lobe flux starts to be reconnected. For\nexample, Maynard et al. (1997) using an extensive\ndataset including Geotail data, have inferred that open\nflux closure did not begin until 15 min after onset in one\nevent, and 40 min after onset in another. In a study of\nionospheric flows using the AMIE technique, Taylor\net al. (1996) also inferred that open flux typically did\nnot start to decrease until 20 min after substorm onset.\nCorrespondingly, the expansion of the auroral bulge is\nobserved to originate on the most equatorward discrete\narc, which is usually located well equatorward of the\nopen\/closed field line boundary, as implied by Aka-\nsofu\u2019s (1964) original picture (see also Galperin and\nFeldstein, 1991), and subsequently confirmed by Viking\nimager data (Murphree and Cogger, 1992; Elphinstone\nand Hearn, 1992; Cogger and Elphinstone, 1992).\nThe latter show that the auroral bulge often reaches\nthe open\/closed field line boundary towards the end of\nthe expansion phase (see also, for example, Lopez et al.,\n1992), at which time the poleward edge often brightens\nand becomes more active whilst the aurora in the middle\nof the bulge often fade, leading to a \u2018\u2018double oval\u2019\u2019\nconfiguration.\nIn this work we will analyse a substorm which\noccurred during the second Galileo Earth-encounter and\nwill show that in this case open flux closure was delayed\nrelative to substorm onset by more than 25 min. This\nwill be inferred from a dataset combining ground\nmagnetic records, radar observations of ionospheric\nflow and satellite measurements.\n2 Instrumentation\nIn this study we will combine together data from a\nnetwork of ground-based instruments with satellite\nobservations to study the evolution of a substorm on 7\nDecember, 1992. Data from the IMAGE, Greenland\nand SAMNET magnetometer chains and Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory (LANL) spacecraft in geosynchro-\nnous orbit are used to detect the substorm onset and\nsubsequent intensification. The location and motion of\nthe convection reversal boundary were monitored by the\nEISCAT incoherent scatter radar, Goose Bay HF radar,\nSABRE VHF radar and the Defense Meteorological\nSatellite Program (DMSP) satellites. Unfortunately,\nthere are no interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data\nfor the interval studied owing to a gap in the IMP-8 data\nrecord. However, Galileo was located in the magneto-\nsheath during its second Earth-encounter and the data\nobtained can be used to deduce the orientation of the\nIMF. Figure 1 shows the positions of the ground\nstations used in this study together with the footprints\nof the LANL satellites. This figure illustrates the broad\ncoverage of the observations, extending over 6 h of\nmagnetic local time (MLT) and from sub-auroral\nlatitudes to within the polar cap. A brief description of\nthe data sources is given.\n1. Data from the EISCAT radar were obtained using\nthe SP-UK-CONV experiment, in which the VHF radar\nwas used in a split-beam mode. One pair of panels of the\nantenna were phased such that the beam pointed along\nan azimuth 344.8\u00b0 to the east of geographic north (west\nbeam) and the beam of the remaining pair to 359.8\u00b0\n(east beam), both at an elevation of 30\u00b0. In this mode,\ntherefore, the VHF system provides two independent\nradars operating with two di\u0080erent fixed beam direc-\ntions. The data are taken simultaneously at each\nazimuth with 10 s resolution. Echoes are received from\nrange gates 65.3 km in length along the beam passing\nthrough the F-region ionosphere, covering invariant\nlatitudes 71\u00b0\u201378\u00b0. The data are analysed using an \u2018\u2018L-\nshell fitting\u2019\u2019 technique to estimate the ionospheric flow\nmagnitude and direction from line-of-sight velocities,\nassuming that the flow is the same along the L-shells\nbetween the two azimuths and that the magnetic field\nparallel flow is negligible. The data have been analysed\nfor the 10 s preintegration periods with no post\nintegration. The MLT of the CONV field-of-view is\napproximately UT + 2.25 h for azimuth 344.8\u00b0 and\nUT + 2.75 h for 359.8\u00b0.\n2. The Goose Bay HF coherent backscatter radar has\nbeen described by Greenwald et al. (1985) and now\nforms part of the SuperDARN network (Greenwald\net al., 1996). The radar measures the power and line-of-\nsight Doppler spectral characteristics of signals back-\nscattered from irregularities in the polar F-region. The\nGoose Bay radar field-of-view covers the range of\ninvariant latitudes 65\u00b0\u201385\u00b0 and spans 4 h of local time.\nThe centre of the field-of-view is at a MLT given\napproximately by UT) 3 h. Data from the 16 beam\ndirections are recorded over successive 6 s integration\nperiods, such that the field-of-view is scanned every 96 s.\nFlow vectors are derived where su\u0081cient backscatter\nintensity is received by the L-shell fitting technique\n(Ruohoniemi et al., 1989; Freeman et al., 1991).\n3. At the time of this study the SABRE radar\ncomprised a monostatic VHF radar located at Wick,\nwith a field-of-view centred on an MLT of \u0018 UT + 1 h\nand covering an invariant latitude range of 61\u00b0\u201365\u00b0. The\ntemporal resolution was typically 20 s. The signal\nreceived by a VHF coherent radar has been scattered\nby E-region irregularities which have a drift speed\nrelated to the convection flow speed. A more complete\ndescription of the SABRE auroral backscatter system is\ngiven by Nielsen et al. (1983).\n4. SAMNET is an array comprising seven triaxial\nfluxgate magnetometers which cover midlatitudes in\nwestern Europe (Yeoman et al., 1990). These data are\nused to identify the occurrence of Pi2 pulsations and\nthus the onset of substorms.\n5. The Greenland magnetometer network consists of\ntwo latitudinal chains of magnetometers located along\nthe east and west coasts of Greenland (Wilhjelm and\nFriis-Christensen, 1976). The east coast chain stretches\nfrom 70\u00b0 to 81\u00b0 in geomagnetic latitude and 56\u00b0 to 111\u00b0\nin geomagnetic longitude. The corresponding ranges for\nthe west coast chain are from 68\u00b0 to 86\u00b0 in latitude and\n36\u00b0 to 47\u00b0 in longitude. Each station has a three-\n1370 N. J. Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications\ncomponent fluxgate magnetometer which operates at\n20 s resolution. The perturbations from the quiet-day\ndiurnal variations are given here in terms of the three\ncomponent directions, H, E and Z, where H is positive\ntowards the north along the local magnetic meridian, E\nis positive towards the east perpendicular to the local\nmeridian, and Z is positive in the vertically downwards\ndirection.\n6. The IMAGE magnetometer network is located in\nScandinavia with stations from mid-latitudes up to\nSvalbard (Lu\u00a8hr et al., 1998). The entire network extends\nlatitudinally from 56\u00b0 to 75\u00b0 and longitudinally from\n106\u00b0 to 119\u00b0 (geomagnetic coordinates). Each of the\ninstruments in the network is a triaxial fluxgate magne-\ntometer similar to those used in the Greenland chain,\nbut the field perturbation components given here are the\nthree orthogonal components, X, horizontal geographic\nnorthward, Y, horizontal geographic eastward, and Z,\nvertically downwards.\n7. The Los Alamos particle analyser instruments\nCPA and SOPA obtained the geosynchronous orbit\nenergetic particle data presented here. The spacecraft\nused in this study are 1984-129 at a local time of\nUT + 06:54 h and 1990-095 at UT + 00:31 h. The\nCPA instruments on 1984-129 measure electrons in the\nenergy range 30\u2013300 keV and ions with energies 72\u2013\n573 keV. The SOPA instruments aboard 1990-095\nmeasure electrons in the energy range 50\u2013315 keV and\nions with energies 113\u2013670 keV. A more detailed\ndescription of the Los Alamos particle instruments is\ngiven by Higbie et al. (1978) and Belian et al. (1992). In\nthis study we use the data to observe particle injections\nwhich identify onset (Baker et al., 1978).\n8. During the interval reviewed here, magnetic field\ndata from the Galileo spacecraft, at the time of its\nsecond Earth encounter, were used to monitor the\nmagnetic field in the Earth\u2019s magnetosheath. Galileo\nwas located at GSM coordinates (X, Y, Z) \u0018 ()70, 40,\n26 RE), su\u0081ciently far from the centre of the tail that the\nmagnetic field data can be used as a reasonable proxy\nfor the IMF. The Galileo magnetometers are described\nin Kivelson et al. (1992).\n9. The DMSP spacecraft are a series of polar orbiting\nsatellites designed to observe the weather on Earth and\nto monitor the near-Earth space environment at\n840 km. We have used ionospheric velocity measure-\nments obtained by the F10 and F11 spacecraft to derive\nthe potential along the spacecraft track and hence the\nconvection reversal boundaries. The orbital period of\nthe satellites is \u0018103 min and each of the polar passes\n(magnetic latitudes exceeding 50\u00b0) takes 18\u201320 min.\n10. FREJA, a Swedish and German scientific satel-\nlite, was launched on 6 October, 1992. Freja orbits at an\naltitude ranging between about 600 and 1750 km with\nan orbital inclination of 63\u00b0. The payload includes an\nauroral imager comprising two cameras. The one\npresented here monitors the molecular nitrogen Ly-\nman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) emissions and has a pass-\nband from 134 to 180 nm (Murphree et al., 1994). The\nimage contained here is a composite of five separate\nFig. 1. Geomagnetic latitude and longitude of the ground-based\nstations used. The MLT is indicated in brackets corresponding\nto 2245 UT, which is one of the principal periods of study. The\nfield-of-view of the Goose Bay radar is labelled GB, the two beams\nfor the EISCAT CP-4-B experiment E and the SABRE beam at\nWick SW. The solid circles represent the positions of the\nmagnetometers in the Greenland Chain (GLC), IMAGE (I) and\nSAMNET (SM) networks respectively.

Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications 1371\nimages taken at two minute intervals, where each of the\nseparate images has an overall field-of-view of 29.4\u00b0 by\n109.2\u00b0.\n3 Observations\nData from the Galileo Earth-encounter II for 21 UT on\n7 December to 01 UT on 8 December, 1992, are plotted\nin Fig. 2. When these data were taken, the satellite was\nlocated in the magnetosheath \u001872 RE downtail. By\ntaking a value of 450 km s)1 for the solar wind speed\n(from the Geotail record), a delay of \u001820 min can be\nestimated as the time taken for e\u0080ects at the nose of the\nmagnetosphere to be detected by Galileo. For the first\nhour of this interval, the magnetic field is mainly\nnorthward pointing with By negative and Bx positive.\nShortly after 2200 UT, a southward turning occurred in\nthe Bz component (\u00182140 UT at the subsolar magne-\ntopause). Subsequently Bz decreased slowly until near\n2235 UT (\u00182215 UT at the subsolar magnetopause)\nwhen it suddenly dropped to )20 nT. Prior to this time\nthe By component was strongly negative (around\n)25 nT) while Bx was near zero. After 2235 UT By\ndeclined sharply towards zero such that the field was\ndirected nearly due south in the GSM frame for about\n20 min. At 2255 UT (\u00182235 UT at the subsolar\nmagnetopause), Bz suddenly turned northward and\nremained so for the following 25 min, except when it\nbriefly returned to zero at \u00182257 UT. From 2315 to\n0015 UT the Bz field was variable but typically weakly\nnegative. During the whole of the period af-\nter \u00182255 UT, Bx was positive and By strongly negative.\nFor the remainder of this study these times will be\nquoted in terms of the e\u0080ect at the subsolar magneto-\npause and not detection by Galileo.\nTurning now to the corresponding ground-based\ndata, we shall now examine the magnetometer and radar\nFig. 2. Magnetic data from Galileo Earth-en-\ncounter II in GSM co-ordinates. The data shown\nare from 21 UT, 7 December, 1992, to 01 UT, 8\nDecember, 1992 and are averaged over 20 s.\nDuring the time period reviewed, Galileo was\nlocated in the magnetosheath at GSM coordinates\n(X, Y, Z \u0018 )70, 40, 26 RE), su\u0081ciently far from\nthe centre of the tail that the magnetic field data\ncan be used to indicate the strength and orienta-\ntion of the IMF. The bottom panel indicates the\nmerging index. A value of 1 denotes that the\nconditions are favourable for low-latitude dayside\nreconnection, i.e. the IMF Bz is southward or the\nmagnetic shear angle between the subsolar mag-\nnetospheric field and the IMF was only \u001870\u00b0\nwhen the IMF Bz was northward\n1372 N. J. Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications\nobservations. The backscatter intensity detected by the\nSABRE radar between 21 and 23 UT is plotted in Fig. 3\nas a function of range and UT. It shows an intensifi-\ncation of the backscatter at 2130 UT, which rapidly\nexpanded equatorward starting at 2200 UT. We infer\nthat this expansion was a response to the southward\nturning of the IMF with a delay of 20 min, and interpret\nthe equatorward motion as a growth phase signature. A\nsimilar phenomenon was reported by Lester et al. (1993)\nduring the SUNDIAL campaign when the onset of\nbackscatter was detected before any substorm onset\nsignatures and was thus assumed to be associated with\nthe southward turning of the IMF. The apparent\nbifurcation of the backscatter band which appears at\naround 2210 UT is probably due to an instrumental\ne\u0080ect known as Lloyd\u2019s mirror (Mattin and Jones,\n1985). The remainder of this figure will be described\nlater, after we have introduced the adjacent magnetic\nobservations at the IMAGE chain.\nThe X- and Z-components of the magnetic field\ndetected by the IMAGE magnetometers are plotted in\nFig. 4. These data show that there was very little\nmagnetic activity during the initial period of modest\nsouthward IMF Bz, 2140\u20132215 UT (Fig. 2), including\nthe nightside response to the growth phase (starting at\n2200 UT) described already. The onset of the first bay in\nthe X-component can be seen at 2215 UT, indicated by\nthe first dash-dot line in Fig. 4a. This occurred around\nthe time of the large increase in southward IMF Bz to\n)20 nT at the subsolar magnetopause (Fig. 2) and the\nonset of the Pi2 s detected by SAMNET, shown in\nFig. 5. Both the X- and Z-components (Fig. 4a, b) of\nthe magnetic deflections seen by the IMAGE array\nprovide evidence that the electrojet was approximately\nFig. 3. Range time intensity plot produced using data from the\nSABRE radar for 21 UT, 7 December 1992\u201301 UT, 8 December\n1992. Only one of the central beams, beam 5, of the Wick radar is\nused here. It is a summary plot used to indicate the existence of\nbackscatter. The colour scale represents the intensity of the\nbackscatter\nN. J. Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications 1373\ncentred at station PEL (62.4\u00b0 latitude) at this time; as\nwell as the peak X component being detected at PEL,\nthere was a positive Z deflection in the stations north of\nthis station and a negative deflection to the south.\nShortly after the expansion phase onset, the poleward\nedge of the backscatter band at SABRE (Fig. 3)\ncontracted equatorward, starting at about 2220 UT.\nThis may have been an e\u0080ect of the substorm electrojet\nentering the radar field of view to the west of IMAGE\n(Fig. 1) where a reduction in flow speed inhibits the\ngeneration of E-region irregularities and hence radar\nbackscatter (Inhester et al., 1981). Since the SABRE\nfield of view was located just prior to midnight at this\ntime, and the reduction of the backscatter encroached\nfrom the east, the implication is that the onset began in\nthe post-midnight sector in the vicinity of the IMAGE\nchain and propagated westward to SABRE.\nReturning now to the IMAGE data, it can be seen\nthat the initial disturbance intensified over an interval of\n\u001815 min before starting to decay. This was followed by\nan intensification at \u00182240 UT (second dash-dot line in\nFig. 4a) centred around MAS (64.9\u00b0), which coincided\napproximately with the northward turning of the IMF\nat the nose, as detected by Galileo (Fig. 2). An associ-\nated Pi2 enhancement was also seen in the D component\nof the SAMNET data (Fig. 5). This intensification\nresulted in a poleward expansion of the substorm\ndisturbed region, which reached the Svalbard magneto-\nmeters (BJO (70.1\u00b0), HOP (71.4\u00b0), HOR (72.8\u00b0) and\nNAL (74.9\u00b0)) after \u00182250 UT. At about this time, the\nmagnetic disturbance at the latitude of the original\nintensification, centred at MAS, started to recover, while\nthose poleward and equatorward were intensifying so\nthat a \u2018\u2018double oval\u2019\u2019 configuration in the magnetic\nperturbations had formed by \u00182300 UT. Recovery of\nthe poleward part of the magnetic disturbance was in\nprogress by 2340 UT and of the equatorward currents\nby 2350 UT.\nH-component data from the Greenland magnetom-\neter chain are plotted in Fig. 6. No perturbations were\nobserved at any of the Greenland chain stations in\nresponse to the substorm onset detected by IMAGE at\n2215 UT. This shows that the initial onset electrojet did\nnot extend westward to the 20 MLT sector, monitored\nby the lower latitude Greenland stations (NAQ and\nFHB). The east coast stations are located at latitudes\nFig. 4a, b. IMAGE magnetometer chain data for 7 December\u20138\nDecember 1992.

The station names and their magnetic\nlatitudes are shown between the plots. The vertical dash-dot lines\nindicate the key substorm timings in this study, 2215 UT was\nsubstorm onset; 2240 UT the intensification; 2310 UT corresponds to\nthe time when the \u2018\u2018double oval\u2019\u2019 was well established; and 2350 UT\nwas substorm recovery\n1374 N. J. Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications\ntoo high to observe the onset (since the perturbations\ndid not reach BJO at 70\u00b0 at IMAGE), but examination\nof data from the Leirvogur station on Iceland (not\nshown) at 66\u00b0 invariant latitude and MLT of UT-0:30,\nhowever, also did not observe any clear signatures\nassociated with the initial onset, showing that the\nelectrojet was confined eastward of about 21:45 MLT.\nThe onset of negative bays was seen after \u00182245 UT in\nthe lowest latitude stations of the east coast Greenland\nchain (AMK \u001870\u00b0, and SCO \u001872\u00b0) in the pre-midnight\nsector, about 5 minutes after the intensification detected\nby IMAGE as discussed (Fig. 4). The disturbance\nsubsequently propagated poleward similarly to the\nIMAGE chain, reaching DNB (\u001875\u00b0) at 2305 UT and\nDMH (\u001877\u00b0) shortly thereafter. The westward electrojet\ndid not reach station NRD (81\u00b0), however. The magne-\ntometer stations on the west coast (\u001821\u201322 MLT)\nobserved no significant perturbations before \u00182300 UT\nwhen weak negative bays appeared at latitudes between\n70 and 75\u00b0. This shows that the substorm westward\nelectrojet did not expand into this magnetic local time\nsector until late in the expansion phase development.\nThe relationship between the magnetic observations\ndescribed already and the substorm disturbed region is\nFig. 5. Data from the SAM-\nNET magnetometers for 21 UT,\n7 December 1992\u201301 UT, 8\nDecember 1992. The data are the\nfiltered H (upper panel) and D\n(lower panel) components of the\nmagnetic field, using a band-pass\nfilter between 40 and 200 s\nN. J. Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications 1375\nillustrated in Fig. 7, where the location of the magne-\ntometer stations are superposed, together with the fields-\nof-view of the various radars used in this study, on an\nauroral image from the Freja spacecraft. The image is a\ncomposite of consecutive UV images obtained in the\nperiod 2329\u20132339 UT. This period corresponds to\nthe interval just prior to the onset of recovery of the\ndisturbance at the IMAGE meridian when the double\ncurrent structure was still well developed but starting to\ndecline (Fig. 4). The images cover a region from the\npost-noon oval on the left, through dusk, and towards\nmidnight on the right, though not quite reaching the\nmeridian of the IMAGE chain in the early post-\nmidnight hours (\u00182 MLT). It can be seen that the\nnightside auroral distribution was very broad, extending\nfrom an equatorward boundary at a magnetic latitude of\n\u001860\u00b0 poleward to \u001873\u00b0, this spanning essentially the\nsame latitude range as the two-component current\nsystem observed on the IMAGE meridian just to its\neast. It can also be seen that the auroral bulge does not\nquite reach the west coast stations of the Greenland\nmagnetometer chain, thus explaining the lack of major\nmagnetic perturbations on this meridian. It does,\nhowever, encompass the equatorward part of the eastern\nchain, although not extending to the poleward stations.\nThe LANL geosynchronous satellites detected parti-\ncle injections around the time of the onset signatures\nseen by IMAGE and SAMNET at 2215 UT (Figs. 4 and\n5). At \u00182218 UT, spacecraft 1990-095 (22:51 MLT)\ndetected a dispersionless proton injection (Fig. 8b),\nfollowed by a weak dispersed electron injection (Fig. 8a)\nwhich implies that the satellite was located just to the\nwest of the injection region. The positioning of this\nspacecraft with respect to the injection region is in good\nagreement with the fact that the Iceland and Greenland\nwest magnetometer chains were too far west to observe\nthe perturbations detected by IMAGE associated with\nthe substorm onset at 2215 UT. We saw that at \u00182240\nUT there was an intensification of magnetic perturba-\ntions at IMAGE, and a Pi2 at SAMNET. The geosyn-\nchronous satellites also detected particle injections\naround this time. Spacecraft 1990-095 detected a rise\nin the proton flux at \u00182242 UT and electron flux\nat \u00182248 UT (23:19 MLT). Both the electron and\nproton injections appeared to be dispersionless (Fig. 8a,\nb). This implies that the satellite was located within the\nMLT of the injection region at this time. Spacecraft\n1984-129 located at 05:44 MLT (data not shown) also\ndetected dispersed electron and proton injections two\nminutes later at 2250 UT. The dispersion curves for\nthese injections appeared to be associated with the\ninjections detected by 1990-095 at \u00182248 UT.\nSummarising the data discussed in Figs. 2\u20138, we can\ndeduce that a cycle of substorm activity occurred\nbetween \u00182140 UT and \u00180030 UT. The start of the\ngrowth phase was determined to be at \u00182140 UT when\nwe infer that the Bz component of the IMF turned south\nat the subsolar magnetopause (Galileo data in Fig. 2),\nsuch that subsequently the SABRE radar (Fig. 3)\ndetected a band of increased backscatter which expand-\ned equatorward, starting at 2200 UT. Expansion phase\nonset signatures were seen by the IMAGE and SAM-\nNET magnetometer chains at \u00182215 UT with the\nLANL satellite 1990-095 detecting a dispersionless ion\ninjection slightly later at 2218 UT. This onset coincided\nwith the IMF Bz component dropping to )20 nT. The\nIMF then remained negative until \u00182235 UT when it\nbecame strongly positive. Shortly after this at 2240 UT,\nthere was intensification in the magnetic perturbations\nand Pi2 s observed by IMAGE and SAMNET in the\npost-midnight sector, and a little later by Greenland east\nand Iceland in the pre-midnight sector. Particle injection\nsignatures were also detected by the LANL satellites\n1990-095 and 1984-124 at this time. The recovery phase\ncommenced around 2340 UT.\nWe now turn to examine the flow data from the\nGoose Bay HF radar, located in the dusk sector to the\nwest of the substorm disturbed region (see Fig. 7). A\nsummary of the flow data deduced from this radar is\npresented in Fig. 9, where we show the vector flow\nFig. 6. The two panels show magnetic field data from the Greenland\nmagnetometer chain for 21 UT, 7 December, 1992\u201301 UT, 8\nDecember, 1992. The top panel is H-component data from the west\ncoast chain (invariant latitudes 66.3\u201385.4\u00b0) and the bottom panel from\nthe east coast chain (latitudes 52.7\u201381.0\u00b0)\n1376 N. J. Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications\nversus invariant latitude and time between 22 and 23\nUT. The flow data are shown for beam 5 of the radar\ndirected towards magnetic north. These data show\nmainly eastward flow in the poleward part of the field-\nof-view and westward flow in the equatorward region,\nsuch that the convection reversal boundary (CRB)\nremains within the field-of-view for much of this\ninterval. These data can thus be used to determine the\nlatitudinal motion of the CRB during the substorm\ncycle. Under usual circumstances, this CRB will usually\nbe located a little equatorward of the open\/closed field\nline boundary if viscous flows are present, thus the\nmotion of the CRB can be taken as a reasonable proxy\nfor the motion of the open\/closed field line boundary,\nallowing us to monitor the expansion and contraction of\nthe polar cap in the dusk sector.\nWe have thus examined the vector velocities over the\nentire field-of-view of the radar (15 beams) and used\nthe method described to find the invariant latitude of the\nCRB for the interval 2130\u201300 UT (1830\u20132100 MLT) as\nshown in Fig. 10. The lack of scatter, or of clear flow\noften makes identification of the CRB latitude di\u0081cult\nand the vertical error bars indicate these uncertainties.\nFollowing an initial equatorward motion between 2130\nand 2135 UT, the CRB remained at \u001870\u00b0 until \u00182200\nUT (Fig. 10). An equatorward motion was then evident\ncontinuing across the onset of the substorm at 2215 UT\nand accelerating prior to the intensification at 2240 UT.\nThis behaviour closely mirrors the behaviour of the\nbackscatter band seen by the SABRE radar (Fig. 3)\nwhich showed a similar equatorward motion between\n2200 and at least 2235 UT. From this we infer that the\nregion of open magnetic flux continued to expand for\n\u001825 min after substorm onset, presumably due to the\nfact that the IMF Bz was \u0018)20 nT during this period,\nsuch that the rate of reconnection on the dayside\nconsiderably exceeded that on the nightside. During this\ninterval, therefore, typical signatures of both growth\nand expansion phases were simultaneously present.\nFollowing the substorm intensification at \u00182240 UT\n(and northward turning of the IMF) the CRB within the\nGoose Bay field-of-view remained at a roughly constant\nlatitude of \u001868\u00b0 until about 2305 UT when it appeared\nto jump poleward to 72\u00b0, where it remained located for\nthe remainder of this interval. Given that there was a\nsubstorm intensification at 2240 UT together with the\npresence of northward IMF since 2235 UT, such that\ndayside reconnection will have been substantially re-\nduced, it is perhaps surprising that the poleward\ncontraction of the CRB at Goose Bay did not occur\nuntil 2305 UT. This point will be discussed later.\nAnother important feature of the Goose Bay flow\ndata can also be seen in Fig. 9, in that there was a major\nchange in the flow pattern at 2245 UT, from an eastward\nflow in the polar cap to strong northeast flows. These\nwere observed for three consecutive 96 s scans until the\nbackscatter from the poleward part of the field-of-view\ndisappeared. An example of the velocities deduced over\nthe whole radar field-of-view during this interval is\nshown in Fig. 11. Comparing Fig. 11 with the Freja\nimage in Fig. 7, shows that the flows in the poleward\nregion of the Goose Bay radar are in fact directed\ntowards the poleward expanding substorm bulge near\nmidnight. It seems reasonable to infer that these flows\nFig. 7. A composite of five consecutive UV images\ntaken from the Freja satellite (orbit 828) between\n2329\u20132339 UT on 7 December, 1992.

Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications 1377\nwere associated with the substorm intensification at\n2240 UT, and were generated by the dipolarisation in\nthe tail and subsequent closure of open flux (Cowley\net al., 1998).\nAdditional information about the ionospheric flow\nand the motion of the CRB was provided by data from\nthree passes across the northern polar cap by the DMSP\nsatellites F10 and F11. These are shown in Fig. 12. The\nUT quoted on the plots corresponds to the time the\nsatellites were closest to the pole during each pass. These\nwere 2133 UT (Fig. 12a), corresponding to the interval\njust prior to the start of the growth phase, 2249 UT\n(Fig. 12b), shortly after the substorm intensification,\nand 2314 UT (Fig. 12c), corresponding to the late\nexpansion phase, prior to the commencement of recov-\nery. The position of the CRBs are listed in Table 1 as\ndetermined from the maximum and minimum values of\nthe potential, together with the local time at which the\nboundary was detected and the UT when the observa-\ntion was made. There are two passes of satellite F10 in\nthe Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 12a, c) which fly\nthrough the 21 MLT meridian close to the field-of-view\nof the Goose Bay radar. The latitudes of the 21 MLT\nCRB for these orbits are plotted in Fig. 10. Early in the\nsequence in Fig. 10, at 2130 UT (\u001818:30 MLT), the\nCRB seen by Goose Bay is at a similar latitude to that\nseen at 21:17 MLT by DMSP F10. At 2309 UT F10\nobserved the CRB at 21:16 MLT at 70.38\u00b0 in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. The centre of the Goose Bay\nfield-of-view is at 20:09 MLT at this time, i.e. the\nsatellite was at a meridian one hour later in MLT. This\ntherefore, is consistent with the minimum latitude\nestimate from the Goose Bay radar.\nTurning now to the flow data shown in Fig. 12, it can\nbe seen that the flow prior to the start of the growth\nphase contained surprisingly large flows on the night-\nside, possibly driven by reconnection in the distant tail.\nThere is also evidence of an anti-clockwise vortex in the\npolar cap possibly driven by lobe reconnection in the\npresence of IMF By negative and Bz positive (Fig. 2). At\n2249 UT, as shown in Fig. 12b, the IMF had returned to\nalmost similar values but now the dayside flows show a\nwell-developed twin-vortex pattern. The presence of\nthese strong dayside flows implies that they were being\ndriven by nightside reconnection and consequent pole-\nward contraction of the open\/closed field line boundary\nassociated with the substorm intensification at 2240 UT.\nAgain strong dayside flows are shown in Fig. 12c, with\nanti-Sunward flow in the polar cap. Given that the IMF\nBz is inferred from Fig. 2 to have been weakly negative\nbut with a very strong negative By at this time, these\nflows were likely to be driven by dayside reconnection as\nindicated by the strong eastward flows near noon,\ntogether with some possible continuing contribution\nfrom the nightside.\nFlow vectors near midnight corresponding to the\nperiod just prior to the growth phase (2125\u2013\n2155 UT = MLT \u001823:55\u201300:25) derived from the EI-\nSCAT radar observations are shown in Fig. 13.

At the start of the interval, the dusk\ncell CRB is apparent as a rotation of the flow from\neastward and equatorward in the poleward part of the\nfield-view, to westward and equatorward in the lower\nlatitude region. This reversal took place at about 72.7\u00b0\ninvariant latitude which is in good agreement with the\nlocation of the CRB observed in the dusk sector at this\ntime by both the Goose Bay radar (Fig. 10) and the\nDMSP satellite F10 (Fig. 12a). After 2140 UT, how-\never, the flows become variable, but predominantly\neastward until 2327 UT over the entire field-of-view.\nThe relationship of these flows to the position of the\nopen\/closed field line boundary is unclear during the\nfirst part of this interval, but at 2250 UT the e\u0080ects of\nthe substorm bulge were observed expanding poleward\nacross the radar beams, clearly establishing the radar\nfield-of-view as being on closed field lines after that time.\nData for this interval are not shown as they will be the\nsubject of a further paper together with the detailed\nobservations of this poleward expansion. Subsequently\nthe dawn CRB propagated equatorward across the field-\nof-view starting at the furthest range gate at 2327 UT\nand reaching the nearest range gate just before 2339 UT.\nThis established westward flow across the field-of-view.\nWe interpret this motion as the equatorward relaxation\nof the substorm bulge in the immediate post-midnight\nsector, corresponding to the onset of substorm recovery.\n4 Discussion\nWe have discussed an interval of substorm activity using\nmultipoint observations encompassing a broad range of\nlatitude and local time in the nightside sector. The\ngrowth phase appears to have been initiated by a\nsouthward turning of the IMF which reached the nose\nof the magnetosphere at 2140 UT as inferred from\nmagnetosheath data from the Galileo spacecraft. The\nproduction of open flux lead to an expansion of the\npolar cap which was observed as an equatorward\nmotion of the CRB in the Goose Bay radar field-of-\nview and an equatorward expansion of the SABRE\nbackscatter band starting at about 2200 UT. A sche-\nmatic of the flow configuration expected at this time is\nshown in Fig. 14, based on the theoretical models of\nCowley and Lockwood (1992). The lines with arrows\nshow the plasma stream lines. Those without arrows\nshow the open-closed field line boundary, where the\nsolid portion indicates the adiaroic section and the\ndashed portion the merging gap. The large arrows\nindicate the motion of the open-closed field line\nboundary. The flows are shown as being driven by\nsteady unbalanced dayside reconnection with the open\/\nclosed field line boundary expanding equatorward at all\nlocal times. We also show the possible co-existence of\nviscously-driven flow cells at latitudes lower than that of\nthe open\/closed field line boundary.\nSubstorm expansion phase onset occurred at 2215\nUT, at which time the IMF became even more strongly\nFig. 10.

This initial disturbance at the IMAGE chain\nwas observed to be centred at 62\u00b0 latitude (station PEL)\nand reached poleward to station SOR at 66\u00b0 but was\nabsent at 70\u00b0 (station BJO). Since the evidence we have\npresented above from both the EISCAT radar in the\nmidnight sector and the Goose Bay and DMSP data in\nthe pre-midnight sector suggest that the open\/closed\nfield line boundary was located poleward of 70\u00b0 at this\ntime, this implies that the onset substorm disturbance\nwas confined to closed field lines and thus did not\nreach the pre-existing open-closed field line boundary.\nTable 1.

Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications 1381\nAlthough this disturbance may have involved an inter-\nval of reconnection in the near-Earth tail, we infer that it\ndid not involve the closure of open flux. Consistent with\nthis, the CRB at Goose Bay and the backscatter band at\nSABRE continued to expand equatorward after onset;\nindeed this motion was intensified after onset, presum-\nably associated with the strongly enhanced negative\nIMF Bz that was present during this time. The flow\npattern is, therefore, likely to be similar to that shown in\nFig. 14a, except that the flow speeds may be enhanced,\nas seen by the Goose Bay radar shown in Fig. 9. There\nmay also be nightside flow perturbations mainly on\nclosed field lines associated with the dipolarisation of the\ntail field (Cowley et al., 1998), although we have no\ndirect data to support this.\nDespite the absence of open flux closure during the\ninitial expansion phase, the later substorm intensifica-\ntion at 2240 UT clearly did involve substantial closure\nof open flux. We infer that open flux was closed because\nfirstly the magnetic disturbance reached high magnetic\nlatitudes up to 75\u201377\u00b0 on the IMAGE and Greenland\neast chain, latitudes that considerably exceeded that of\nthe CRB at both Goose Bay and EISCAT seen prior to\nsubstorm expansion. Second, we observed a region of\nstrong poleward flow directed towards the midnight\nsector in the polar cap in the Goose Bay radar field-of-\nview. A composite of the radar flow observations is\nshown in Fig. 15, comprising vectors from both the\nEISCAT and Goose Bay radars at \u00182245 UT. A\nschematic of the flows occurring at this time consistent\nwith these observations is shown in Fig. 14b. These\nshow the presence of enhanced nightside flows driven by\ntail reconnection consistent with the poleward flows\nseen in the higher latitude region of the Goose Bay\nradar in the dusk sector. These strong flows continue\nFig. 15. EISCAT and SuperDARN flow vectors at 22:44:51 UT \u2013\nthe time of onset of the poleward flows seen at Goose Bay\nFig. 14a\u2013c.

Enhanced nightside flows are shown driven by tail\nreconnection, consistent with the poleward flows detected by the\nGoose Bay radar at high latitudes. The strong flows are seen in the\ndayside sector driven by the contraction of the open\/closed field line\nboundary. c Shows the scenario during the substorm recovery phase\nwith the equatorward relaxation of the boundary in the midnight\nsector, together with the weaker poleward motions elsewhere.\nAsymmetric flow on the dayside is present as detected by the DMSP\nF10 satellite (Fig. 12c)\n1382 N.

Fox et al.: A multipoint study of a substorm occurring on 7 December, 1992, and its theoretical implications\ninto the dayside sector driven by the contraction of the\nopen\/closed field line boundary as observed by the\nDMSP F11 spacecraft. The schematic also shows a\npossible anti-clockwise lobe cell vortex which may be\ndriven by the IMF By negative and Bz positive which\nwas present at this time. This pattern provides a possible\nexplanation of the sudden poleward motion of the CRB\nobserved at Goose Bay at 2305 UT. Prior to this time,\nthe observed CRB may have been located in the viscous\ncell on closed field lines. At 2305 UT the radar could\nthen have moved into the flow cell region driven by\nnightside reconnection such that the observed CRB\nwould be located much closer to the open\/closed field\nline boundary, as shown in Fig. 14b. A schematic of the\nrecovery phase is shown in Fig. 14c which is related to\nequatorward relaxation motion of the boundary in the\nmidnight sector as observed by EISCAT and weaker\npoleward motions elsewhere. In addition, asymmetric\nflow is also shown as being driven on the dayside during\nthis interval by open flux production associated with the\nweaker southward IMF with By negative which was\nagain present during this interval, as indicated by the\nDMSP data in Fig. 12c.\n5 Conclusions\nWe have examined observations over a substorm cycle\nfrom a variety of data sources located over 6 h of local\ntime in the nightside sector. The observations from the\nGoose Bay and SABRE radars have enabled us to\ninvestigate the behaviour of the dusk convection cell\nwhile the EISCAT radar and IMAGE magnetometer\nchain simultaneously detected activity in the immediate\npost-midnight sector. The onset and development of the\nsubstorm were monitored by the IMAGE and Green-\nland magnetometer chains, Pi2 data at midlatitudes, and\nenergetic particle data from two geosynchronous satel-\nlites. The IMF conditions for this interval were deter-\nmined by the data from the Galileo satellite in the\nnightside magnetosheath. There was an initial growth\nphase of about 30 min during which the IMF Bz\ncomponent was \u0018)5 to 10 nT. The Bz component\nsubsequently dropped to )20 nT in concert with the\nsubstorm expansion phase onset signatures. IMF Bz\nthen remained at this large negative value for another\n20 min until it suddenly turned to a positive value\nof \u001820 nT. This northward turning occurred shortly\nbefore a substorm intensification, and commencement\nof the CRB contraction. The recovery phase commenced\nat around 2340 UT.\nThe most important results that we have found from\nour study are as follows. Firstly, the substorm onset\nelectrojet was confined to closed field lines equatorward\nof the pre-existing CRBs observed by the Goose Bay\nand EISCAT radars. No evidence of substantial closure\nof open flux was observed following this substorm onset.\nIndeed the CRB in the duskside continued to expand\nequatorward following onset due to the continued\npresence of strong southward IMF, such that growth\nand expansion phase features were simultaneously\npresent. Clear indications of closure of open flux were\nnot observed until after the subsequent intensification at\n2240 UT, i.e. more than 25 min after the initial onset.\nAfter this time, the substorm auroral bulge in the\nnightside hours propagated well poleward of the pre-\nexisting CRB, and strong flow perturbations were\nobserved by the Goose Bay radar, indicative of flows\ndriven by reconnection in the tail. These data thus\nprovide strong evidence that the closure of open flux in\nthe tail can be delayed significantly relative to the onset\nof the substorm expansion phase.\nAcknowledgements.
