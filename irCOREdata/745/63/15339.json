Consideration of the\nformer has the attraction that the factors that determine the\nvalue of the matrix element are apparently easier to appreci-\nate in physical terms. Since, at least for wide wells, a\nquantum-well bound state in band j can apparently be rea-\nsonably approximated by the product of a slowly varying\nenvelope function and the periodic part of the j th band-edge\nBloch function, we expect a large intraband dipole-matrix\nelement between the ground and first excited state, by anal-\nogy with s to p atomic transitions, since the envelope func-\ntions of the ground and first excited states in a quantum well\nhave s- and p-like symmetry, with respect to the center of the\nwell. The same approximation suggests a small interband\nmatrix element between valence- and conduction-band\nground states due to the similar nature of the envelope func-\ntions for the two states, the main differences being between\nthe Bloch periodic parts which are characteristic of the\natomic scale. However, Burt1\u20133 has shown this \u2018\u2018\u2018atomic pic-\nture\u2019\u2019 to be incorrect for quantum wells and illustrated the\npoint with examples based on simple models of quantum-\nwell structures.\nThe purpose of this paper is to test Burt\u2019s conclusions for\nreal quantum-well systems, to which end a model employing\na local empirical pseudopotential method4,5 ~EPM! is used.\nThis allows the generation of a full-zone band structure, with\nspin-orbit coupling effects included. To determine the bound\nstates for a quantum well, the band structure for a complex\nwave vector6,7 is first calculated for each material, using an\n89 plane-wave basis to ensure satisfactory convergence of\nenergies and wave functions.\nA technique has been developed ~to be submitted for pub-\nlication! for the extraction of envelope functions, as defined\nby Burt,8 from the EPM wave function. These envelope\nfunctions are by definition continuous and smooth at all po-\nsitions, including across the interfaces between barrier and\nwell materials. The valence- and conduction-band bound\nstates, with wave functions c (v) and c (c), respectively, can\nbe expressed as envelope-function expansions using bulk\nzone-center states un(r) as the basis, i.e.,\nc ( j)~r!5(\nn\nFn\n( j)~r!un~r!, ~1!\nwhere n is the band index, Fn are the envelope functions, and\nj labels the bound state, indicating in which band ~conduc-\ntion or valence! the bound state exists. The wave function\nand zone-center states are both spinors, while the envelope\nfunctions are scalars ~the dependence on the spatial coordi-\nnate r will not be made explicit in the subsequent discussion\nunless its omission might lead to confusion!. Equation ~1! is\nvalid in both barrier and well layers for a given choice of un\nfixed throughout the structure, which can be chosen to be\nbarrier or well bulk zone center states, as normally used in\nk\u0095p calculations, or some other appropriate complete set.\nHowever, the envelope functions depend on the particular\nchoice made, the well material zone-center states being used\nin the present work. It is important to note that the expansion\ngiven in Eq. ~1! is exact and fully reproduces the ~pseudo!\nwave function ~though of course the numerical calculations\nare necessarily approximate!.\nTwo quantum-well systems are modeled, with the well\ngrowth direction being z and the in-plane wave vector ki set\nto zero. The two systems are the widely studied\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 15 NOVEMBER 1999-IVOLUME 60, NUMBER 19\nPRB 600163-1829\/99\/60~19!\/13306~4!\/$15.00 13 306 \u00a91999 The American Physical Society\nInP\/In0.53Ga0.47As system, where the ternary alloy is lattice\nmatched to bulk InP with a55.8688 \u00c5 ,9 and the less well-\nknown CdTe\/InSb system, which is treated here as lattice\nmatched with the CdTe lattice constant of a56.480 \u00c5,5 al-\nthough in fact InSb is very slightly mismatched with a\n56.478 \u00c5.5 A virtual crystal model is used to represent the\nalloy. The important parameters for both systems are sum-\nmarized in Table I. The InSb and In0.53Ga0.47As wells are 55\nand 95 atomic layers wide, respectively, where an atomic\nlayer is a single plane of atoms with a quarter of the width of\nthe lattice constant.\nThe typical nature of the envelope functions is illustrated\nin Fig. 1, which shows plots of the significant contributions\nfor one of the spin degenerate pairs of conduction-band\nground states of the InP\/In0.53Ga0.47As system. Due to the\ninclusion of spin, there are two zone-center states for each of\nthe conduction, heavy-hole ~hh!, light-hole ~lh!, and spin\nsplit-off ~sso! bands, but for clarity the envelope functions\ncorresponding to just one of these are plotted and their\nphases have been adjusted so that they are real. They take the\nsame form as seen in the results of a typical eight band\nk\u0095p method.10\u201312 Since the un are normalized to the unit cell,\nit is apparent from the relative values of the envelope func-\ntions that the expansion for c (c) is dominated by the term\nassociated with the zone-center state for the first conduction\nband, i.e., in general the dominant term is that due to the\nzone-center state for the band which forms the quantum well\nin which the state is confined. For example, the contribution\nfrom the conduction-band term to the total charge density of\nthe conduction-band ground state of the InP\/In0.53Ga0.47As\nsystem is 97%. This is the justification for the single-band-\nedge ~SBE! approximation, which takes the energy eigen-\nfunctions to be of the form\nc ( j)\u2019F j\n( j)u j , ~2!\nwhere j5v or c, which has been widely used to predict the\nelectronic and optical properties of quantum wells ~see, for\nexample, Ref. 13!.\nThe dipole-matrix element ~in units of the electronic\ncharge! between states c (i) and c ( j) along the well growth\ndirection z is given by\nzi j5^c\n(i)uzuc ( j)&. ~3!\nThe dipole-matrix elements between selected states predicted\nby this approximation are listed in Table II.\nThe valence\u2013conduction-band entries in the SBE approxi-\nmation represent the \u2018\u2018atomic dipole approximation,\u2019\u20192,3\nwhere interband transitions between states with the same\nenvelope-function symmetry but different zone-center states\nhave a very small dipole-matrix element. On the other hand,\nthe intraband dipole-matrix element between states domi-\nnated by the same zone-center terms but whose envelopes\nare of opposite parity can have dipole moments much larger\nthan the atomic scale. Indeed, the intraband dipole moment\nfor the CdTe\/InSb system is approximately 24e \u00c5 , which\ncorresponds to a displacement of the electronic charge of\nabout 16% of the well width, which is a factor of roughly\nfour greater than the lattice parameter ~6.48 \u00c5!, or 8.5 times\nthe bond length.\nWe now examine the dipole-matrix elements as predicted\nby a double-band-edge ~DBE! approximation, given by\nc ( j)\u2019Fv\n( j)uv1Fc\n( j)uc , ~4!\nwhere the subscript v implicitly includes a sum over hh, lh,\nand sso bands. Inclusion of the sso band, which is not strictly\nat the band edge, is not essential to the present discussion but\nimproves the accuracy of the approximation due to its cou-\npling with the conduction band. The predicted dipole matrix\nelements are shown in Table II, as are those using the full\ncomplex band-structure EPM wave function, or equivalently,\nthe complete expansion in Eq. ~1!.

For\nthe electron to light-hole case, the inclusion of the second\nband-edge terms has increased the matrix element by at least\n6 orders of magnitude. For the CdTe\/InSb system, the inter-\nband matrix element is actually about 13.6e \u00c5, correspond-\ning to 9% of the well width, which is clearly at odds with the\natomic approximation. It is also important to point out that\nthe failure of the SBE approximation for the interband\ndipole-matrix elements does not imply that the same problem\noccurs for the interband momentum matrix elements, which\nare actually predicted rather well in that approximation.\nObviously, the single-band-edge approximation has omit-\nted detail vital to the correct evaluation of the interband\ndipole-matrix elements. This turns out to be the contribution\nof the \u2018\u2018cross\u2019\u2019 terms,3\n^Fv\n(c)uvuzuFv\n(v)uv&1^Fc\n(c)ucuzuFc\n(v)uc&, ~5!\nwhich dominate the interband matrix element, even though\nthey derive from terms which play only a minor role in the\nenvelope-function representation of the wave function. The\nterms in Eq. ~5! have similar features to those with intraband\nmatrix elements in the single-band-edge approximation, i.e.,\na common zone-center state and envelopes of differing par-\nity. Thus, large dipole-matrix elements are obtained.\nRelated to the dipole-matrix element between bound\nstates is the charge oscillation induced by coherent optical\nexcitation of an electron between the two states, due to illu-\nmination by a laser, for example. Under such conditions, we\nexpect to see charge oscillation on the scale of the matrix\nelement. Hence, for interband excitation, the single-band-\nedge approximation predicts atomic scale charge oscillation.\nWe consider at time t0 the electron to be in a superposi-\ntion with an equal amplitude of valence- and conduction-\nband bound states, i.e.,\nC~r,t0!5\n1\nA2\n@C (v)~r,t0!1C\n(c)~r,t0!# , ~6!\nwhere C ( j)(r,t)5c ( j)(r)e2iv jt is the ~normalized! solution\nto the time-dependent Schro\u00a8dinger equation for bound state j.\nTherefore, at a later time t, the charge density uC(r,t)u2 will\nhave a time-dependent component t(r,t) given by\nt~r,t !5 12 $~c\n(v)!*c (c)e2ivcvt1c.c.%, ~7!\nwhere vcv5vc2vv5(Ec2Ev)\/\\ gives the angular fre-\nquency of oscillation. Figure 2 shows plots of t for light-hole\nto conduction-band ground states in the InP\/In0.53Ga0.47As\nsystem, as calculated using the two approximations and the\nexact model using the complex wave-vector band-structure\nmethod. After half a period of oscillation, t has the same\nform as in Fig. 2 but is reflected about the center of the\nquantum well. Thus, the double-band-edge approximation\nand the exact calculation of t , Figs. 2~b! and 2~c!, will lead\nto the charge density being modulated over the width of the\nwell. However, the single-band-edge approximation only\nmodulates the charge density on the scale of the crystal unit\ncell and predicts a form for t that has a symmetric envelope\nabout the center of the well.\nThus it is apparent that, as is the case when predicting\ninterband dipole-matrix elements, the inclusion of the sub-\ndominant terms in the envelope-function expansion of the\nwave function is crucial in establishing interband charge os-\ncillation on the scale of the well. In the single-band-edge\n~dominant band! approximation, t(r,0) reduces to\n(Fv(v))*Fc(c)uv*uc , plus its complex conjugate. The envelope\nfunctions have the same parity, so that their product has even\nparity, with respect to the center of the well. Thus, t can only\nproduce charge oscillations on the atomic scale due to the\nfactor uv*uc , which is periodic with the crystal lattice.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated the complete failure\nof the atomic picture for interband dipole moments and\ncharge oscillation in real quantum-well systems. It is essen-\ntial that terms from at least two band edges are used in an\nenvelope-function approximation when performing such cal-\nculations.\nR.A.C. would like to thank EPSRC and BT for financial\nsupport.\nFIG. 2.
