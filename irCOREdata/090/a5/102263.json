In relation to the resources which were available \nto parents, the results indicated that support from social networks and mental health \nservices was generally perceived to have been lacking. However, both informational \nand emotional support were available from self-help groups for relatives\/carers. The \nimplications of this study for therapeutic practice are discussed. \n \n \nKeywords: schizophrenia; carers; coping; social support\n  3\nParents\u2019 experiences of caring for sons and daughters with \nschizophrenia: a qualitative analysis of coping  \n \nIntroduction \nCurrent social policy objectives of community care in the UK have resulted in many \nrelatives adopting the role of primary carer for individuals diagnosed with \nschizophrenia. Research findings indicate that up to 60% of individuals with \nschizophrenia continue to live with their relatives, mostly with parents (Kuipers, \n1993). However, it is acknowledged that caring for a son or daughter with a mental \n\u2018illness\u2019 involves unique financial, social and emotional burdens (Doll, 1976; \nGibbons et al., 1984; Potasznik and Nelson, 1984; Crotty and Krulys, 1986; Gubman \nand Tessler, 1987; Hatfield and Lefley, 1987; Maurin and Boyd, 1990; Oldridge and \nHughs, 1992; Winefield and Harvey, 1993), due mainly to the changes in behaviour \u2013 \nassociated with clinical symptoms \u2013 that parents experience in their son or daughter \n(Birchwood and Smith, 1987). Within traditional understandings of schizophrenia, \nthe clinical manifestations of the \u2018condition\u2019 are commonly divided into positive and \nnegative symptoms (Lemma, 1996). Positive symptoms are the florid manifestations \nof the condition (such as hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder) which are \ncharacteristic of psychotic episodes, while negative or residual symptoms refer to \ndeficits in functioning, such as social isolation or withdrawal, marked impairment of \nrole functioning and self-care and flat or inappropriate affect. The negative symptoms \nare more persistent across time, do not respond well to medication and consequently \ncan be more demanding for carers. \n  4\nGiven the substantial number of parents providing care in the community within such \npotentially challenging circumstances, it is important to understand their experiences \nand to examine the factors which contribute to the process of coping with the \ndemands of caring for a son or daughter with schizophrenia. The aim of this study \nwas to investigate the experiences of a group of parents in detail and specifically to \nidentify aspects of caring for a son or daughter with schizophrenia that had been \nparticularly difficult to cope with, coping strategies that had been used by parents to \ndeal with the stresses of their caring role and resources that had been helpful in \nfacilitating coping. These questions arise from the study\u2019s theoretical framework, \nwhich was provided by Lazarus and Folkman\u2019s (1984) interactional theory of stress \nand coping. According to this theory, the key aspects of adjustment to a stressful \nevent are the nature of the stressor, the strategies adopted by the individual to cope \nwith the stressor and the resources available to facilitate coping.  \n \nMethod \nParticipants were recruited from two carers\u2019 support groups organised by the National \nSchizophrenia Fellowship in south east England. Due to the study\u2019s commitment to \nundertake a detailed exploration of individual accounts, the sample size was relatively \nsmall, consisting of eight parents (six mothers and two fathers) of people with \nschizophrenia. Their mean age was 61 years (range: 54-73 years); all were British, \nwhite and married. Each parent had one adult child with schizophrenia; five parents \nhad a son with schizophrenia and three had a daughter. These offspring had a mean \nage of 34 years (range 25-44 years) and had had a diagnosis of schizophrenia for a \n  5\nmean duration of 13 years (range 5-25 years). At the time of the interview, five were \nliving with their parents, two were living in independent accommodation and one was \ncurrently in a psychiatric hospital. Those parents whose children who were not \ncurrently living with them nevertheless saw themselves as (having been) significantly \ninvolved in the care of the children following the diagnosis of schizophrenia.  \n \nEach participant was interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. \nInterviews covered their offspring\u2019s psychiatric history and current symptoms (which \nare not reported in this article), the nature of the parents\u2019 care-giving role (including \nany difficulties), their methods of coping and resources available to and used by \nthem. Interviews were audio-taped and the tapes were transcribed verbatim. \nTranscripts were subjected to a form of thematic content analysis (Smith, 1995; Pauli \nand Bray, 1998), which involved reading and re-reading the transcripts to discern \nthemes (commonalities of reported experience). Where appropriate, these were then \nassigned to theoretical categories derived from Lazarus and Folkman\u2019s (1984) \ninteractional theory of stress and coping \u2013 the stressors which parents reported, their \ncoping strategies and coping resources. The aim of this stage of analysis was to \ndevelop a theoretically  enriched understanding of the experiences reported by \nparticipants. By starting with themes derived from participants\u2019 accounts, this two \nstage process avoids the risk of entirely overwriting participants\u2019 subjectivities with a \npriori categories. In the analysis presented here, interpretations are illustrated by data \nextracts to enable readers to assess their persuasiveness (Elliott et al., 1999). In the \nquotations, empty square brackets indicate where material has been omitted, material \n  6\nwithin square brackets is provided for clarification and ellipsis points (\u2026) indicate a \npause in the flow of participants\u2019 speech. Any information that might compromise \nparticipants\u2019 confidentiality \u2013 including their names and the names of their children \u2013 \nhas been changed. \n \nResults \nThe analysis will begin by examining how parents reported having coped with the \nstressors associated with their caring role. The main stressors identified by the parents \ncentred on the common clinical symptoms associated with schizophrenia; the coping \nstrategies described in the interviews will be discussed in relation to these symptoms. \nConsideration will then be given to the coping resources that parents identified as \nhaving been available to them. \n \nClinical symptoms and coping strategies \n \nPositive symptoms: While all the parents had had to cope with the positive symptoms \nassociated with their offspring\u2019s schizophrenia, for most participants these were not \nof immediate concern at the time of the interview as hallucinations and delusions had \nmostly subsided. In those cases where delusions were an ongoing feature of their \nson\u2019s or daughter\u2019s condition, various coping methods were described. Some parents \nattempted to negotiate rational explanations for delusional beliefs with their son or \ndaughter. For example, Lisa\u2019s son had delusions about telepathy. When asked how \nshe responded to these ideas, she said, \u2018It depends what the idea is. But, you know, [if \n  7\nhe says] \u201cI knew you were going to say that\u201d, you know, I\u2019d say \u201cWell, it could be \nyou know me very well or that could just be coincidence\u201d\u2019. \n \nHowever, most participants found this strategy to be ineffective as their offspring\u2019s \ndelusional beliefs were not open to refutation and required very little in the way of \nevidence to support them. Over time, these carers reported having learned to adopt a \nstrategy of \u2018constructive disengagement\u2019 (Birchwood and Smith, 1987), wherein they \navoided actively challenging or colluding with the delusion by refusing to enter into \nany lengthy discussion about it. For example, Vivienne said: \u2018I won\u2019t discuss it with \nhim any more, no, because I know we get nowhere. At one time I used to think \u201cOh, \nif only he\u2019d talk and we could get to the bottom of this\u201d but it doesn\u2019t get to anywhere \n\u2013 it doesn\u2019t get anywhere, no\u2019. For most participants, this strategy seemed to have \nevolved following a frustrating period during which they went to great lengths to \nchallenge their son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s delusional beliefs (which implies that those \nparents who were currently engaged in this process might ultimately also turn to a \nstrategy of disengagement). In the absence of any guidance on how to cope with the \nsymptoms, carers reported having gone through an arduous process of trial and error \nin developing effective coping strategies and many bemoaned the lack of professional \nadvice during this difficult period. \n \nNegative symptoms: While the positive symptoms of their offspring\u2019s condition \ncontributed to the burden experienced by the parents in this study, the negative \nsymptoms or behavioural deficits associated with schizophrenia proved more \n  8\ntroublesome \u2013 a finding which is consistent with surveys of family burden (Creer and \nWing, 1974; Fadden et al., 1987). Many commentators have suggested that negative \nsymptoms are particularly problematic because of the difficulty carers have in \nattributing these to \u2018mental illness\u2019 (Fadden et al., 1987; Hooley et al., 1987; \nBarrowclough and Tarrier, 1992). Negative symptoms involve an absence of normal \nfunctions which the person was once able to perform, so they are easily attributed to \nan unwillingness on the part of the person diagnosed with schizophrenia to engage in \nappropriate behaviours, rather than being seen as the symptoms of a \u2018genuine illness\u2019.  \n \nHowever, there was little evidence of this attributional process in the present study. \nAll participants demonstrated a sound understanding of the traditional \nsymptomatology of schizophrenia and attributed their son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s negative \nsymptoms to the effects of mental illness rather than to person-related factors. \nInstead, the major difficulty which carers experienced in relation to negative \nsymptoms appeared to arise from their offspring\u2019s increased dependence on them. For \nexample, Karen explained how her son\u2019s social withdrawal meant that he relied \nexclusively on her and her husband for social contact and could sometimes act in \nquite manipulative ways in order to increase his contact with them: \u2018There are times \nwhen he says \u201cMum, I just can\u2019t go out today. I don\u2019t want to go down to the shops \u2013 \nthey\u2019re talking about me in the shop\u201d, you know, \u201cCall in and get me some tobacco \non the way because I don\u2019t want to go to the shop\u201d [ ]. But he can be quite \nmanipulative because he\u2019s told me that he will say that people are talking about him \n  9\neven when he knows that they\u2019re not [ ] because he\u2019s lonely and he wants company \nand he hasn\u2019t got anyone else\u2019.  \nParticipants reported using various strategies to cope with their offspring\u2019s social \nwithdrawal or lack of motivation. In their review of coping literature, Stroebe and \nStroebe (1995) noted that most studies distinguish between two main types of coping \nresponse: problem-focused strategies, which are directed towards altering the source \nof stress, and emotion-focused strategies, which attempt to manage or reduce the \nemotional distress associated with the stressful situation. Faced with their offspring\u2019s \nsocial withdrawal or lack of motivation, some parents reported having tried actively \nto engage their son or daughter in family activities and\/or having encouraged them to \npursue hobbies and personal interests \u2013 an example of problem-focused coping. \nGeorge illustrated this type of coping response: \n \nGeorge: I spent a lot of time trying to find something which he would be \ninterested in, you know... I bought him a camera, you know \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you \nlearn to be a photographer?\u2019 \u2013 and pointed him in that direction [ ].  \nInterviewer: So your response to this was to try and bring him out of himself \nand engage him in certain activities. How effective was that? \nGeorge: Not very, no. [ ] We got more and more disappointed that we could \nnot succeed in doing that. \n \nSonia also described her attempts to encourage her daughter to be more outgoing, \nwhich were met with limited success: \n  10\n \nSonia: We try every now and then and say \u2018Couldn\u2019t you see so-and-so or \nsomebody?\u2019 or whatever. Um\u2026and it doesn\u2019t usually work, you know. \n Interviewer: So how do you cope with it when she is being quite withdrawn? \nSonia: Well, if you\u2019re referring to the last three months, I probably leave her \nalone because I don\u2019t really \u2013 I can\u2019t alter the fact, you know, and I \u2013 I\u2019ve \nlearned to live with it [ ]. When she\u2019s withdrawn I just leave her to it these \ndays. \n \nAgain, a process of trial and error seemed to have occurred for most participants, with \na gradual acceptance of their offspring\u2019s withdrawal or lethargy and a consequent \nreduction in their own efforts to motivate them. This illustrates a gradual shift from \nproblem-focused strategies to more emotion-focused forms of coping, such as \nacceptance. \n \nThe importance of acceptance was emphasised by many parents, as this form of \ncoping had clear benefits for their own well-being. As Lisa explained, accepting her \nson\u2019s withdrawal helped to reduce her own anxiety about his behaviour: \n \n Interviewer: Did his withdrawal affect you differently in the past? \nLisa: Yes, it did cos, you know, I had in my mind \u2018What is he doing that for?\u2019 \nall the time instead of just letting it be. So that caused a conflict for me \u2013 my \nown thought on that one...\u2018What is he doing that for?\u2019. It\u2019s just to let him be  \n  11\n[ ] and that seems to have helped in a way \u2013 total acceptance [ ]. It\u2019s helped \nme feel better about it \u2013 now I don\u2019t worry so much. \n \nIn addition, some parents indicated that acceptance had also had a beneficial effect on \ntheir offspring. Lisa observed that, in relation to her son, \u2018It\u2019s helped him as well as \nme. Me controlling my problem of wondering \u201cWhat\u2019s he thinking?\u201d and all this sort \nof thing [laughs] has helped Martin as well [ ] because I found out as I went along \nthat the pressure wasn\u2019t a good thing. So you\u2019d just have to let things come out \nnaturally\u2019.  \n \nHowever, the development of a position of acceptance and of recognition that there is \nlittle that the parent can actually do to improve their offspring\u2019s condition may be a \nlong and difficult process, compounded by a sense of helplessness. The process of \narriving at a position of acceptance seemed to have been facilitated for some parents \nby a greater understanding of the reasons for their offspring\u2019s withdrawal. Lisa \ncommented: \u2018Now his withdrawal doesn\u2019t affect me because when he withdraws now \nI know sometimes that it is because he\u2019s getting a bad voice. But he\u2019s dealing with it \nand that\u2019s the main point\u2019. \n \nFor others, acceptance of their relative\u2019s behaviour seemed to have developed \nthrough a process of downward social comparison. For example, Sonia said, \n\u2018Um\u2026but then, you know, if you can find someone who\u2019s worse off than you and \nyour, uh, what she\u2019s doing now is a lot better than some of them. Um, you have to \n  12\nlook for chinks of light in your own...however small they might be\u2019. This contradicts \na central tenet of social comparison theory (Festinger, 1954) which states that people \nwill choose others who are doing slightly better than themselves for comparison \npurposes in order to learn how to cope more effectively. However, a similar process \nof downward social comparison has been observed in people with cancer (Taylor, \n1983; Wood et al., 1985) and there is a body of evidence reviewed by Wills (1981, \n1987) which suggests that, under threat, individuals tend to make downward social \ncomparisons in order to bolster self-esteem (although other writers suggest that the \nprocess is more subtle and complex: see Taylor and Lobel, 1989; Aspinwall and \nTaylor, 1993). For the parents in this study, such comparisons seemed to have been \nmade in order to accept what they could not change. Where problem-focused \nstrategies had failed to improve their offspring\u2019s behaviour, parents reported that they \ngradually began to focus on managing their own emotional reactions to the situation. \nComparing their son or daughter to others who were functioning at a lower level or \ndeveloping a better understanding of the reasons behind their offspring\u2019s withdrawal \nseemed to have helped parents move towards acceptance and improved their \nemotional well-being in the face of an ongoing (and difficult-to-change) stressful \nsituation. \n \nResources available to carers \nAccording to the interactional theory of stress and coping (Lazarus and Folkman, \n1984), the resources available to an individual play a major role in determining that \nperson\u2019s ability to cope with a stressful event or situation (coupled with the person\u2019s \n  13\nability to access and make productive use of these resources) . Parents\u2019 resources will \nbe considered under the headings of social support, self-help groups and mental \nhealth services. \n \nSocial support: Although many studies have suggested that families in which \nsomeone has schizophrenia experience social isolation (Anderson et al., 1984; \nNamyslowska, 1986; McCreadie et al., 1987), the parents in this study had \nexperienced a range of  responses from their family and friends. Some felt well \nsupported by their social network; this seemed to be related to their family or friends \nhaving had first-hand experience of mental distress themselves. However, others did \nnot feel that social support was forthcoming. Some parents spoke of their reluctance \nto seek support: \u2018I think probably we ourselves perhaps withdrew or \u2013 or were \u2013 felt, \num, a bit inhibited in making social contact with other people because we felt they \nwouldn\u2019t understand or we didn\u2019t feel we wanted to bring that kind of thing into \nsocial contact, you know \u2013 you don\u2019t want people to identify your family with\u2019 \n(Sonia). Most participants referred to the perceived stigma of mental illness and it \nappeared that this was a key factor underlying the social isolation experienced by \nsome parents. \n \nSelf-help groups: All participants were members of the National Schizophrenia \nFellowship and attended relatives\u2019\/carers\u2019 groups. Their comments indicated that they \nderived many benefits from these groups, principally the opportunity to meet others \nwho truly understood their situation, which was said to have alleviated their sense of \n  14\nisolation. For example, Karen said, \u2018I\u2019ve found that people that have not experienced \nmental illness \u2013 severe mental illness \u2013 haven\u2019t got a clue...unless you\u2019ve experienced \nit, you\u2019ve no idea\u2026um\u2026and the best people to talk to as far as, um, feeling included \nand feeling that you\u2019re understood, is to other carers\u2019. \n \nBelonging to a relatives\u2019\/carers\u2019 group, then, helped to meet support needs which \nwere frequently not met elsewhere. Another benefit mentioned by parents was the \nsharing of information. The provision of basic information about the \u2018nature\u2019 and \n\u2018course\u2019 of schizophrenia has been consistently rated as meeting one of the most \nimportant needs of relatives (Birchwood and Smith, 1987; Perring et al., 1990; \nHeron, 1998). Among the participants in this study, relatives\u2019\/carers\u2019 groups were \nevaluated as providing an ideal context for the provision of such information to \nchallenge \u2018social myths\u2019 about schizophrenia. For example, George said, \u2018The prime \nvalue [of the relatives\u2019 group] is when you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re...at the start \nof the illness when you are quite unfamiliar with mental illness at all, you\u2019ve never \nexperienced it, it\u2019s not been talked about, uh, it\u2019s not generally known \u2013 you have all \nthese scares about violence and murderous intent and suicide and all the rest of it, \nwhich is all you hear during the normal course of events. [ ] So information and \npractical advice is the main advantage\u2019. \n \nThe social support literature has distinguished between emotional support, which \nconveys to the person that they are accepted and understood, and informational \nsupport, consisting of advice and guidance on how to deal with problem situations \n  15\n(Cohen and Wills, 1985). From the parents\u2019 comments, it seemed that both types of \nsupport appeared to have been provided in their relatives\u2019\/carers\u2019 groups. However, \nwhile the value of self-help groups for relatives of people diagnosed with \nschizophrenia is being increasingly recognised (Hatfield and Lefley, 1987; Heller et \nal., 1997), some participants spoke of having experienced difficulties when attending \nsuch groups. For example, Elizabeth described how attending a relatives\u2019 group \nproved overwhelming for her when her son first developed schizophrenia: \u2018It wasn\u2019t \nfor a couple of years before I was desensitised so that I could talk to people without \nexperiencing the pain \u2013 uh \u2013 emotional pain, I suppose at the thought of it [ ]. I found \nit very difficult, even going to the support group, because every time I was to talk \nabout it or open my mouth about it, I\u2019d experience the pain. So in the initial stages, if \nyou like, when you need support, um, it was too much to take\u2019. Joan also talked of \nhow attending such groups may prove dispiriting for parents whose children have \nrecently been diagnosed and how it might deprive them of hope for the future: \u2018One \ndifficulty is [ ] that the nucleus of this group that I run \u2013 we\u2019re all getting quite old \nand our children have been ill for quite a long time [ ] so if you get someone new \ncoming along in a crisis it\u2019s very difficult and you can comfort them and say \u201cThings \nget better with time\u201d and so on but when they look at us and they can see that we\u2019re \nstill caring after twenty-five years, it\u2019s not very encouraging\u2019. \n \nMental health services: Although mental health services may potentially act as a \nsignificant coping resource for parents, a high level of dissatisfaction with these \nservices was reported by participants in this study, which is consistent with other \n  16\nstudies (Spaniol et al., 1987; Perring et al.,1990). The main reasons for this \ndissatisfaction were identified as a lack of information about the nature, course and \nbehavioural management of schizophrenia and a sense of being excluded from the \ntreatment process. \n \nAll participants again emphasised the importance of obtaining comprehensive, \naccurate information about schizophrenia, particularly in the early stages. Drawing \nupon their experiences, they felt \u2013 with the exception of one participant \u2013 that this had \nnot been adequately provided by the mental health services with which they had been \nin contact. Joan\u2019s experience, for example, was shared by many:  \n \nJoan: Nobody ever tells you anything, and I think in the early stages you need \na lot of support and you need a lot of information and explanation and so on  \n[ ]. \nInterviewer: Specifically, what kind of information do you think you needed \nat that point? \nJoan: Well, I needed information about the course of the illness, the \nmedicines, the symptoms. Because this is like, you know, it hit me, and \npeople don\u2019t know anything about schizophrenia and they think it\u2019s a dual \npersonality, don\u2019t they? \n \nParticipants described the onset of schizophrenia in a son or daughter as a \nbewildering and often frightening experience. This was compounded by the fact that, \n  17\nas Joan indicated, their knowledge about the condition was often limited or \nmisinformed by social myths. However, as one parent observed, eliciting appropriate \ninformation from professionals was \u2018like drawing blood from a stone\u2019 (Karen).    \n \nThe second major complaint made by many parents concerned the failure of the \nmental health system to include them in the treatment process. For example, Sonia \nexpressed her feeling of exclusion: \u2018We ourselves, really, have been largely sidelined \n[ ]. Uh, things were said \u201cWell, these are now confidential matters\u201d and, um, we still \nfind that very difficult because, uh, how can you be not informed about somebody \nthat you\u2019re caring for? Um\u2026and you need to know certain things \u2013 otherwise you \ncan\u2019t care properly for that person\u2019. \n \nThese comments indicate that parents wished for greater co-operation with mental \nhealth staff. Professionals\u2019 reluctance to include relatives in the treatment process was \nattributed to overly strict interpretations of confidentiality, which were felt to be \ninappropriate. Many parents also felt they would have benefited from psychological \nhelp and support from mental health professionals. This was rarely offered but those \nwho had experienced counselling had found it beneficial. \n \nDiscussion \nThis research has provided some insights into the nature of the stresses that parents \nmay face in caring for a son or daughter who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. \nThe sample chosen for this study was very specific and the results need to be \n  18\ninterpreted in the light of this. All participants belonged to self-help groups and had \nbeen caring for their son or daughter for some years. This means that only these \nparticular perspectives on caring for a child with schizophrenia were represented in \nthis study. For example, the fact that negative symptoms associated with \nschizophrenia constituted the parents\u2019 primary burden may be related to the length of \ntime for which they had been caring for their son or daughter. This suggestion is \nconsistent with the results of a study which found that the type of burden experienced \nby parents shifted from a concern with the management of challenging behaviour \nduring the early stages of the condition to an increased preoccupation with issues of \nemotional involvement arising from the effect of negative symptoms in later stages \n(Cook et al., 1994). Also, the data relating to the benefits of self-help groups need to \nbe interpreted in the light of the fact that all participants were attending such groups \nand so it is reasonable to assume that they had derived some benefits from this. Had \nthe research recruited parents who did not belong to a relatives\u2019\/carers\u2019 group or who \nhad ceased attending, the results may have been quite different. Future research needs \nto recruit those who are unable \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 to benefit from such groups \nand to explore alternative coping resources that might be used by these parents. \n \nA further limitation is that all participants were recruited from a specific geographical \nlocation. However, the results of other studies (for example, Perring et al., 1990; \nLamb and Layzell, 1995) suggest that relatives\u2019 sense of exclusion from the treatment \nprocess and their difficulties in eliciting information from professionals may be \ncommon experiences which are not restricted to particular geographical areas. The \n  19\nethnic homogeneity of the sample does represent a limitation, though: further \nresearch is needed to explore the experiences of parents from different ethnic \ncommunities as it is reasonable to assume that their experiences may be different \nbecause of group-specific social representations of schizophrenia and because of \ndifferent histories of involvement with mental health services across ethnic \ncommunities (Fernando, 1988, 1995; Pilgrim and Rogers, 1999). \n \nDespite this, if the present study has succeeded in accessing some common parental \nexperiences, the implications for therapeutic practice would be considerable. Mental \nhealth professionals need to recognise the difficulties experienced by parents who are \nperforming a caring role for sons and daughters who have been diagnosed with \nschizophrenia and to offer appropriate assistance and support to promote effective \ncoping. It has been recommended that practitioners adopt a needs-led approach \n(Birchwood and Smith, 1987; Barrowclough and Tarrier, 1992), in which the diverse \nneeds of families are recognised and individually-tailored interventions are designed \nto meet these needs. However, the findings from this study suggest that, in the early \nstages of schizophrenia, there may be a common desire among parents for clear, \ncomprehensive information about schizophrenia, the role of medication and possibly \nother matters too (such as the management of challenging behaviours). This may \ncreate dilemmas for mental health professionals whose practice is informed by the \nnow substantial literature which adopts a critical and deconstructive stance towards \nschizophrenia (for example, Bentall, 1990; Boyle, 1990, 1996; Parker et al., 1995). \nWe have not invoked this literature in this article because we wished to frame our \n  20\nanalysis in terms of the phenomenology of the parents, whose conceptualisations of \nschizophrenia were firmly located within a traditional medical model. Instead of \nmeeting parents\u2019 informational needs within the parameters of this model, some \nmental health professionals may wish to challenge this conceptualisation and \nintroduce parents to alternative and perhaps more useful discourses within which to \ninterpret their offspring\u2019s condition.  \n \nFor parents who have been dealing with their offspring\u2019s schizophrenia for some \ntime, the mental health professional\u2019s role may be to facilitate the development of \nmore emotion-focused strategies and to help parents come to terms with and accept \nthe persistent symptoms associated with their offspring\u2019s condition. This might \ninvolve working with parents to acknowledge the limits of their ability to change \ncertain aspects of their son\u2019s or daughter\u2019s condition, thereby allowing them to focus \non their own emotional well-being. The provision of a non-judgmental environment \nwhere feelings such as anger, grief, hopelessness and guilt can be expressed and \nworked through might be an important part of this therapeutic process. The potential \nvalue of mental health professionals facilitating a parental shift towards greater \nacceptance has been indicated by research on expressed emotion, which has \ndemonstrated that individuals said to be suffering from schizophrenia are highly \nsensitive to environmental stress (for example, Brown et al., 1958, 1972; Brown, \n1959; Leff and Vaughn, 1985; Parker and Hadzi-Pavlovic, 1990; Bebbington and \nKuipers, 1994; Butzlaff and Hooley, 1998). Some carers find that reducing pressure \non their relatives with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and developing a position of \n  21\nacceptance can help to alleviate such stress and thus can have a beneficial effect. \nProtective family environments have been shown to be characterised by a non-critical \nand somewhat detached attitude on the part of carers (Leff and Vaughn, 1985), an \nattitude which is more likely to be fostered by emotion-focused strategies, such as \nacceptance and distancing, than problem-focused strategies which aim to change the \nbehaviour of the relative. The promotion of this type of coping response, then, may \nserve the dual purpose of improving parents\u2019 psychological well-being and protecting \noffspring from any undue pressure or stress. However, further research is required to \nallow recommendations for therapeutic practice to be advanced with greater \nconfidence.  \n \nReferences \nAnderson, C., Hogarty, G., Bayer, T. and Needleman, R.A.
