Experiments were \nestablished in crops of wheat (Triticum aestivum) over three seasons in two fields, Twelve \nAcres and Far Sweetbrier.  The aim was to evaluate a set of variable rate nitrogen strategies \nand examining the spatial variation in crop response to applied N.  The optimum N \napplication rate in Twelve Acres with three different soil series (predominantly calcareous \nsilty clay loam over oolitic limestone), was uniform across the field.  In contrast Far \nSweetbrier with uniform soil type (slightly calcareous brown clay loam), provided a more \nvariable response.  Estimates of yield potential, produced from either historic yield data or \nshoot density maps derived from airborne digital photographic images, were used to divide \nexperimental strips into management zones.  These zones were then managed according to \ntwo N application strategies.  The results from the historic yield approach, which is currently \nthe most practical commercial system, based on three years of yield data, were variable with \nno overall yield or economic advantages.  It was concluded that that this approach may not \nprovide a suitable basis for varying N rates.  The shoot density approach, however, offered \nconsiderably greater potential as it takes account of variation in the current crop.  Using this \napproach, it was found that there was insufficient variation in the shoot density in Twelve \nAcres. However, in Far Sweetbrier with the uniform soil type, applying additional N to areas \nwith a low shoot population and maintaining the standard N rate to areas with an average \nshoot population resulted in an average strategy benefit of up to 0.46 t ha-1 compared with \nstandard farm practice.  It is necessary to combine the \u201creal-time\u201d data on relative crop \nstructure, obtained by remote sensing with ground truth assessments and absolute benchmark \nvalues to successfully adjust N input levels to maximise yield. \n3 \n \n1 Introduction \nOver the last few years, since the advent of precision farming technologies, the farming \nand research communities have undoubtedly provided overwhelming evidence of non-\nuniformity in yields at the within-field level (Stafford, 1997).  It has been the purpose of \nresearch programmes to better understand the causes of inherent within-field variability and \nto offer appropriate remedial strategies.  In so doing, precision farming aims to provide both \neconomic and environmental benefits. \n \nOne of the most significant factors that can be varied by a farmer to influence the \neconomics of arable cropping is nitrogen fertiliser application (Dampney et al., 1998).  \nHowever, the determination of specific rates is complex; other factors, such as P and K, can \nbe measured relatively easily, and areas with a low index can be topped up as needed using \ngrain and straw off-take values as shown in Godwin and Miller (2001). \n \nA number of studies (e.g. Carr et al., 1991; Mulla et al., 1992) have examined the \npotential for applying variable rates of fertiliser within fields to improve economic \nperformance and minimise environmental impact.  In addition, a range of approaches for \ndetermining management strategies for applying variable fertiliser have been examined \nincluding topography (Nolan et al., 1995); soil sampling with grids (Vetsch et al., 1995) and \nhistoric yield strategies (Kitchen et al., 1995). \n \nIt has been proposed that yield maps can provide a useful basis for applying variable rates \nof fertiliser as they integrate soil, landscape, crop and climate factors together into an \nexpression of relative productivity (Kitchen et al., 1995).  However, climatic factors can be \n4 \nvariable between seasons, particularly in the UK, which suggests that yield data may be \nspecific to the conditions encountered in that particular season.  One solution to this problem \nwould be to devise strategies based on \u201creal-time\u201d information, that take account of variations \nin the current crop rather than previous crops.    \n \nThe aim of this work was to evaluate a range of strategies for managing variable inputs of \nnitrogen based either on historic yield data or crop parameters assessed in \u201creal-time\u201d.  Such \ninformation should provide an answer to the question often posed: once within-field \nvariability in yield potential is identified, should more or less nitrogen be applied to the good \nareas of the field and the opposite to the poor?  Moreover, it should assist in determining \nspecific N application rates.  In addition, the work provides an opportunity to quantify any \nspatial variation in crop response to applied nitrogen.  These studies were conducted on both \nwheat (the subject of this paper) and barley (the subject of a sister paper by the same authors, \nWelsh et al (2001)). \n \n2 Materials and Methods \n \n2.1 Site details \n \nExperiments were conducted over three seasons at two field sites; Twelve Acres, \nGloucestershire and Far Sweetbrier, Bedfordshire, full details of which are given in Table 1.     \n \n \nThree distinct soil series were identified in Twelve Acres (Fig 1A) and Plate 1: Sherborne \nseries, which consists of calcareous topsoil, typically 25 to 35 cm deep, overlying a brashy \n5 \nOolitic limestone;  Moreton series, which is similar to Sherborne but deeper to limestone, \ntypically 50 to 60 cm; and Didmarton series which is clayey throughout the profile.  At Far \nSweetbrier, the soil series throughout the field is Hanslope (Fig. 1B) and Plate 2, further \ndetails of all the soils can be found in Earl et al (2001). \n \n \n2.2 Experimental design \nThe experiments were conducted in an a similar manner to those reported by Welsh et al \n(2001) for barley, using a strip-based approach similar to that of Mulla et al. (1992) and \nKachanoski et al. (1996), there were, however, some differences as described in detail below.  \nThe experimental design comprised five non-replicated variable N treatment strips, two non-\nreplicated uniform N treatment strips and five standard N application rate strips (controls) to \ngive a total of twelve strips.  The strips were 10 m or 12 m wide (half tramline width) for \nTwelve Acres and Far Sweetbrier respectively, and ran parallel with the tramlines along the \nlength of the field, illustrations of which are given in Figures 2 and 3.  The treatment strip \nlengths were approximately 300 m and 350 m for the two fields respectively.  This \narrangement of strips was selected to allow a conventional 24 m fertiliser spreader to be used \nfor nitrogen application working on either side of the central tramline (some adjustments \nwere made to accommodate the 20 m tramline spacing at Twelve Acres).  The 10 m or 12 m \ntreatment width allowed one 5 m wide swath to be harvested by the combine without the \ninclusion of the area of the tramline wheel marks.   \n \nThe standard nitrogen strips were inter-leaved with the variable nitrogen treatments, the \npurpose of which was threefold: \n \n6 \n(1) To enable the interpolation of a yield map based on the yield of the standard \nstrips, which will indicate the inherent field variability. \n(2) To allow treatment comparisons to be made, since classical experimental design \nand statistical analyses with replicated plots is not possible. \n(3) To produce a spatial range of crop yield response curves from the yield response \nof adjacent non-standard nitrogen rate strips and the mean of their adjacent \nstandard strips. \n \n2.3 Treatments \nThe estimation of the \u2018standard\u2019 nitrogen application rate for the field was based on \nprevious knowledge of nitrogen response curves for comparable wheat crops on similar soil \ntypes, obtained from data collected by Arable Research Centres.  This standard N rate, given \nin Table 2, also took account of the average soil mineral N level in Twelve Acres, which was \nmeasured (0 \u2013 30 cm depth) annually in February.    Nitrogen rates for the treatments were \nthen either increased or decreased by 25% to 30% of the standard. This range of nitrogen \nrates was selected to ensure significant levels of crop response.  \n \n2.3.1 Uniform treatments.   \nIn addition to the standard rate there were two treatment strips with uniform applications \nof nitrogen of plus and minus 25% to 30% of the standard along their complete length, also \ngiven in Table 2.  The purpose of this was to provide an indication of the crop response to \ndifferent levels of nitrogen in the high, average and low yield potential areas of the field. The \nlocation of the treatment strips was maintained for both cropping seasons, with the exception \nof one of the standard strips, which was replaced in 1998\/99 by a low N rate (40 kg N ha-1) \nand in 1999\/00 by a zero N strip. The purpose of which was to allow the calculation of \n7 \napparent fertiliser N recovery rates and to provide an additional data point on the yield \nresponse to applied N response curve. \n  \n2.3.2 Variable treatments. \nIn order to address the question posed earlier, two nitrogen application strategies were \ntested: \n(1) More N on the \u2018good\u2019 areas, and less N on the \u2018poor\u2019 areas \n(2) Less N on the \u2018good\u2019 areas, and more N on the \u2018poor\u2019 areas \n \nBefore these strategies could be implemented, however, yield potential had to be estimated \nto define \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018poor\u2019 areas.  This was achieved using two different approaches; historic \nyield and shoot density. \n \n2.3.3 Historic Yield (HY) approach. \n \nVariability in yield potential can be estimated from the analysis of a time series of historic \nyield maps, in this case, for the period 1995 to 1997. \n \nYield data from the combine harvester were first corrected for systematic errors \n(Blackmore and Moore, 1999) and then used to study the spatial and temporal stability trends \nin yield within the field.  To remove any seasonal effects, each annual yield map was \nnormalised by expressing the yield as a percentage of the field mean.  Taking the average of \nthe three years\u2019 data then identified areas of consistently high and low yield.  The 100% \ncontour represents the three-year field mean as shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for the two fields. \n \n \n8 \nHaving identified areas of consistently high, average and low yield, experimental strips \nwere established to test the nitrogen application strategies 1 and 2.  On historic yield-1 (HY1) \nthe high potential area (110% of field mean; SD=2.6%) received 25% to 30% more nitrogen; \nthe average received the standard application rate and the low potential area (96% of field \nmean; SD=2.4%) received 25% to 30% less nitrogen.  The converse strategy was applied to \nthe historic yield-2 (HY2) strip.  The management zones were maintained for all cropping \nseasons. \n \n2.3.4 Shoot Density (SD) approach. \n \nYield potential can also be estimated from shoot density maps (Wood and Taylor, 2001) \nderived from airborne digital photographic (ADP) images, taken immediately prior to the \napplication of nitrogen (Figs. 4 and 5).  The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) \nwas used as a surrogate to extrapolate ground measurements of crop structure (Taylor et al., \n1997). \n \nOnce the images had been acquired and calibrated with ground observations of shoot density, \nthe treatment strips were divided into management zones of high, average and low shoot \ndensity.  The decision on whether areas were high or low was based on relative differences in \nshoot density compared with the field average in each season.  \n \nThis is illustrated in Fig. 4(a) for Twelve Acres and Fig. 4(b) for Far Sweetbrier in 1997\/98. \nAt Twelve Acres, in the shoot density-1 (SD1) strip areas of high density received 250 kg N \nha-1 (25% more nitrogen); the average received the standard application rate (200 kg N ha-1) \nand areas of low shoot density received 150 kg N\/ha-1 (25% less nitrogen). The converse was \napplied to the shoot density-2 (SD2) strip. For SD1 in Far Sweetbrier, areas of high shoot \n9 \ndensity received 160 kg N ha-1 (28% more nitrogen); the average received 125 kg N ha-1 and \nareas of low density received 90 kg N ha-1 (28% less nitrogen). Again, the opposite strategy \nwas applied to SD2. \n \nAt Twelve Acres in 1998\/99, the original shoot-density treatment strips were relatively \nuniform, so alternative strips with more variation were chosen. However, the distribution of \nshoot density meant that only low and average zones could be established.  Along SD1, the \nlow density zone received 150 kg N ha-1 and the average 200 kg N ha-1.  The treatments along \nSD2 were 250 kg N ha-1 in the low density and 200 kg N ha-1 in the average zone. At Far \nSweetbrier the treatment strips remained in the same positions, but again it was only possible \nto define areas of low and average shoot density. These received 90 and 130 kg N ha-1 \nrespectively in SD1, and 170 and 130 kg N ha-1 in SD2. \n \nIn 1999\/00, the treatment strips in Twelve Acres were re-located back to their original \npositions, but as their shoot populations were uniformly low throughout they were classed \nsimply as low density zones. The SD1 strip therefore received 150 kg N ha-1, and the SD2 \nstrip 250 kg N ha-1. As in 1998\/99 Far Sweetbrier was divided into low and average zones, \nwith SD1 receiving 140 and 190 kg N ha-1 respectively, and SD2 receiving 240 and 190 kg N \nha-1. \nThe mean shoot density in each of the zones for each season is summarised in Table 3, \nwith the exception of Far Sweetbrier in 1998\/99 where the images of spring wheat were not \nground-calibrated. \n \n10 \n2.4 Fertiliser application \n \nIn all seasons the fertiliser was applied as a split programme using standard farm-scale \nmachinery.  In 1997\/98, the nitrogen fertiliser (Hydro Extran) was applied using a 24m Kuhn \nAero pneumatic spreader to ensure an even application rate.  The results of the calibration \nstudy of fertiliser distribution along the boom gave a coefficient of variation (CV) of 11.5%, \nwhich confirms a very uniform distribution in comparison with other spreaders where CV\u2019s \nin excess of 20% are not uncommon (Culpin, 1992).  In 1998\/99 and 1999\/00, liquid fertiliser \nwas used (Chafer Nuram 37) and was applied with a Chafer sprayer using T-jet nozzles.  \nTable 4 gives details of the fertiliser applications at Twelve Acres and Far Sweetbrier. \n \n2.5 Assessments \n \nIn addition to the NDVI images acquired prior to N application, spatial plant and shoot \npopulation analyses were conducted, as described by Wood and Taylor (2001), to calibrate \nNDVI images acquired throughout the growing season in December, March and May. On the \nbasis of the soil and yield maps, neutron probe access tubes were installed in three zones, \ncorresponding with the Sherborne, Moreton and Didmarton soil series in Twelve Acres and \nevenly spatially distributed in Far Sweetbrier.  Volumetric soil moisture measurements were \nmade on a regular basis using a neutron probe.  Crop structure, plant tissue, grain quality and \nsoil nutrient parameters were also measured. \n \nThe crop response to the standard and variable nitrogen applications was measured by \nharvesting along each of the strips and recording the final yield using a Massey Ferguson 38 \ncombine equipped with a yield mapping system. \n11 \n \n2.6 Statistical analysis \n \n2.6.1 Accuracy of yield comparisons.   \nThe yield comparisons in this study are arithmetic means of sequences of consecutive \nyield monitor observations made whilst harvesting the whole plot with the combine at \u2018steady \nstate\u2019 (i.e. after the appropriate \u2018lead in\u2019 to the plot) and using the full operational width of \ncut.  Therefore, the errors in the estimated average plot-yields result from the error \ncharacteristics of the yield monitor and not from sampling, as in the case of quadrat \nobservations.  Moore (1998) measured the performance of the type of yield monitor used in \nthe combine and showed that the monitor underestimated the average yield of fields by \napproximately 20 kg ha-1 with the standard error of individual observations being equivalent \nto 155 kg ha-1.  Confidence intervals for the plot yields were then calculated for each of the \nsections; these ranged from \u00b170 to \u00b190 kg ha-1, depending upon the number of yield \nobservations in each of the sections. \n \nYield variation within each of the sections (e.g. high-yield zone) was expressed as the \nyield range about the mean yield for that section. \n \n3 Results \n \n3.1 Rainfall and soil water \n \nThe total rainfall, Table 5 and Fig. 5, was less than the 10 year average annual rainfall of \n731 mm for Twelve Acres in 1997\/98 and higher in the two following years, which were \n12 \nvirtually identical.  The total annual rainfall for Far Sweetbrier was greater in all seasons than \nthe 10 year average (571 mm) with 1997\/98 receiving a lower rainfall than the following 2 \nyears.  Over the three year period Far Sweetbrier received in total 28% less rainfall than \nTwelve Acres. \n  \n \nThe resulting soil moisture content data are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 together with the field \ncapacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) moisture contents for the soils.  These \nwere estimated from the soil physical properties for each of the soil series using pedo-transfer \nfunctions (Hall et al., 1977).  The results show that there are differences in both field capacity \nand permanent wilting point for the 3 soils at Twelve Acres, with Didmarton having a larger \namount of available water in the 900 mm profile (i.e. FC-PWP = 140 mm) compared to \nMoreton (130 mm) and Sherborne (120 mm).  The available water content at Far Sweetbrier \nin the Hanslope series soil is 130 mm. \n \nThe distribution of rainfall differed between seasons, and fields such that at Twelve Acres \nthe autumn\/winter period (August-November) in 1997 was siginficantly drier than the other \ntwo years.  This resulted in a lower \u201cover winter\u201d soil moisture content which did not reach \nfield capacity as shown in Fig. 6A.  In 1998\/99 and 1999\/00 the soils effectively reached field \ncapacity.  Despite this initially lower available moisture content, in 1998 the soil moisture \ncontent was no lower at harvest than in the subsequent years.  The drier autumn\/winter period \nin 1997 maintained the moisture content of the Didmarton series to levels similar to Moreton, \nwhereas, in subsequent years it was significantly higher.  The changes in the profile water \ncontent in the May-June period for each year follows similar patterns for all 3 soils. \n \n13 \nThe wettest September-December period occurred in 1998, which had sufficient impact to \nprevent the establishment of winter wheat at Far Sweetbrier, and instead spring wheat was \nsown in February 1999. \n \nThe two years of data for Far Sweetbrier (Fig. 7) show a similar level of peak moisture \ncontent with an ultimately drier soil at harvest in 1997\/98, after significant rainfall in June \nwhich returned the Hanslope series to field capacity. \n \n3.2 Local yield response to applied N \n \nThe type of data collected by the yield monitor along the length of the uniform treatment \nstrips is illustrated for Twelve Acres in Figure 8. From this, values can be extracted to \nexamine the yield response to N fertiliser rate in different areas. Measurements made during \nthe lead-in time of the combine at the start of each treatment strip, and at the boundaries \nbetween zones, were subsequently removed from the data set (shaded areas, Fig. 8). \n \nIn this case (1997\/98), there was a tendency for yield to increase, moving from the \nMoreton soil series through to the Didmarton, and the trends were very similar for all three N \nrate strips. Data from the Moreton and Sherborne zones were used to produce comparative \nnitrogen response curves for each soil series (Fig. 9). Unfortunately, the area of Didmarton \nsoil at the end of each strip was insufficient to allow a similar analysis, due to the lead-in time \nrequired for the combine and fertiliser spreader.  \n \n \n14 \nThe yields obtained at Twelve Acres were lower in 1999\/00 (Fig. 9C) than in either of the \nprevious two seasons (Figs. 9A and 9B). The only notable difference in average yield \nbetween the two main soil series was in 1997\/98, when the Sherborne series was marginally \nbetter. However, in both this season and in 1999\/00, when the two soil series yielded \nsimilarly, the optimum N application rate was the same, and equal to standard farm practice \n(200 kg N\/ha). In 1998\/99, the Moreton series again showed little benefit from more than 200 \nkg N\/ha, but for the Sherborne an optimum in excess of 250 kg N\/ha was indicated. \n \nIn Far Sweetbrier, differences between seasons were more obvious. However, both the \ntypes of wheat crop grown, and the N application rates evaluated, differed between years. \nOverall yields were lower for the spring wheat crop in 1998\/99 (Fig. 10B) than for the first \nwinter wheat crop of 1997\/98 (Fig. 10A) or the third winter wheat crop of 1999\/00 (Fig. \n10C). \n \nBecause Far Sweetbrier has a single soil type, the yield strips were simply divided along \ntheir length into three zones, forming south-western (zone 1), central (zone 2) and north-\neastern (zone 3) sections. Average treated yields in zone 2 were similar to those in zone 3 in \nall seasons. However, at the low N rate in 1998\/99 and at the zero N rate in 1999\/00, the yield \npenalty was smaller in zone 3. Zone 1 gave equal yields to zones 2 and 3 in 1997\/98, but was \nlower yielding in both the following seasons. The nitrogen response curve in zone 1 showed \nthe same pattern in all three years (albeit for a different range of N rates), with the standard \namount always optimum. For zones 2 and 3, a similar optimum rate was indicated in 1999\/00, \nbut in the previous two years the N response curves suggested a higher optimum than zone 1. \n \n15 \nInterestingly, there is evidence that historically Far Sweetbrier was divided into two fields, \nand zone 1 equates very closely with one of these separate fields, as shown in Plate 3. \n \n3.3 Variable nitrogen strategies \n \n3.3.1 Historic yield approach. \nAs with the uniform treatment strips, yield data taken from each of the historic yield \nmanagement zones (Fig. 11) can be used to produce N response curves (Fig. 12) for areas of \nlow and high historic yield, and thus evaluate the various historic yield nitrogen strategies. \n \nAt Twelve Acres, the differences between zones, and between seasons, were similar to \nthose observed with soil series (Figs. 12A-C). The optimum N application rate was \neffectively the same for both high and low yielding zones, and equal to the standard rate of \n200 kg N\/ha. However there was a more obvious decline in yield where a higher than \noptimum N rate was applied in the high yielding zone. \n \nWith no yield improvements resulting from an increase or decrease in the N application \nrate compared to the standard 200 kg N\/ha, none of the historic yield nitrogen strategies \n(more N on the high yielding and less on the low yielding, or vice versa) gave any benefit \n(Table 6). Even if alternative strategies are constructed, such as applying more N on the high \nyielding zones only, and applying the standard rate to the remainder (HY3 in Table 6), or \nmore N on the low yielding zones only (HY4 in Table 6), there are still no benefits.     \n \n \nAt Far Sweetbrier, the relative responses to N application rate differed substantially \nbetween seasons. In 1997\/98, there was little difference between the historic high and low \n16 \nyielding zones, no doubt partly due to lodging that occurred over a large part of the field (Fig. \n13A). However, there was an indication of a more consistent yield increase with N rate in the \nlow yielding zone. In 1998\/99, there was little yield advantage from applying more than the \nstandard N rate (130 kg N\/ha) in the high yielding zone, but the optimum for the low yielding \nzone appeared to be above the maximum tested (170 kg N\/ha). In 1999\/00, the optimum for \nboth the high and low yielding zones was equal to the standard rate (190 kg N\/ha). \n \nAs a result of these responses, in 1997\/98 and 1998\/99 the HY2 strategy (less N on the \nhigh yielding areas, more on the low yielding) gave a substantial yield improvement \ncompared to standard farm practice, although the average N rates applied were also \nmarginally greater (Table 7). Other strategies also gave benefits in 1997\/98, but these were \nsmaller. The only other strategy to give a yield increase in 1998\/99 would have been to apply \nmore N on the low yielding areas, with the standard rate on the remainder (HY4). However, \nin 1999\/00, none of the strategies showed a yield improvement compared to standard farm \npractice. \n \n3.3.2 Shoot density approach.   \nFigure 14 is an example from Far Sweetbrier in 1997\/98, where management zones have \nbeen assigned according to shoot density. It shows the yield along each of three treatment \nstrips (SD1 and SD2 shoot density strategies, plus the standard for comparison) for areas of \nlow, average and high relative shoot density. As before, data can be extracted to allow \nexamination of the yield response to applied N in each zone. In both Twelve Acres and Far \nSweetbrier, no high shoot density zones could be defined in 1998\/99 or 1999\/00, so the strips \nwere divided into low and average shoot density areas only. \n \n17 \nAt Twelve Acres, there were no differences in N response between low and high shoot \ndensity zones in 1997\/98, and the optimum N rate for both was the standard 200 kg N\/ha \n(Fig. 15A). In 1998\/99 and 1999\/00, with no high density zones, it is not possible to compare \nresponse curves, and 200 kg N\/ha was again optimum in both seasons (Fig. 15B-C). With no \ndifferences between zones, neither the SD1 shoot density strategy (more N on the high \ndensity area and less on the low) or SD2 (more on the low, less on the high) gave a yield \nimprovement over standard farm practice (Table 8). However, in 1998\/99, as there was no \nhigh density zone the average N rate applied to the SD1 strip was less than the standard, and \nwith no real yield penalty this did represent a benefit. \n \nAt Far Sweetbrier in 1997\/98 (Fig. 16A), the responses to N rate were small in both low \nand high shoot density zones, and there were no obvious differences between them, other \nthan the high zone being marginally higher yielding. In 1998\/99 (Fig. 16B) and 1999\/00 \n(Fig.16C), there were no high density zones, but in the low zones yield rose sharply with \nincreasing N, and optimum rates in excess of the highest amounts tested were indicated. In \n1997\/98 yield differences between the two shoot density strategies, and standard farm \npractice, were small. In the following two seasons, however, SD2 (more N on the low density \nareas, less on the high) resulted in a yield improvement compared to standard practice, giving \nan average yield improvement of 0.46 ha-1 over the three years (Table 9). However, the \naverage amount of N applied to the SD2 strips was higher than for the standards. \n \n \n3.4 Spatial variability of yield response to applied nitrogen \n \n18 \nIn addition to evaluating different variable nitrogen application strategies, the data can be \nused to examine the spatial variability in crop yield response to nitrogen application rate, \nusing values from different locations within the field. This is illustrated for Twelve Acres \nover the three-year period in Figure 17, and for Far Sweetbrier in Figure 18. \n \nIn 1997\/98 and 1999\/00, the yield response to nitrogen rate was very similar in all areas of \nthe field, although yield level differed slightly between locations (mostly with soil type). \nHowever in 1998\/99 differences were apparent, indicating that seasonal factors were \ninfluencing whether or not there was spatial variability in yield response to nitrogen. \n \nDespite a uniform soil type, it is clear that both actual yields and their response to N rate \nvaried considerably between locations within Far Sweetbrier. These differences were most \nobvious in 1998\/99 and 1999\/00 (1997\/98 was confounded by patchy lodging). There were a \nnumber of similarities between these two seasons, for example location 1 was lower yielding \nthan location 5 in both, but they showed similar N responses. In contrast, the N responses in \nlocations 2 and 4 clearly differed between the two seasons, which must be related to other \nfactors.  \n \n19 \n4 Discussion \nThe local yield response data for Twelve Acres suggested that the Didmarton soil type was \nhigher yielding than either the Moreton or Sherborne series. Yield maps from previous years \nunder uniform management had also shown the same trend. This can be explained by the \ngreater depth of soil to rock and higher available water capacity that distinguish the \nDidmarton from the other two soils. The yield difference was most obvious in 1997\/98, \nwhich was the driest of the three seasons. Differences in moisture holding capacity can \nexplain a large proportion of crop variability between soil types (Moore and Tynedale-\nBiscoe, 1999). Also 1997\/98 was the only season that indicated a difference between the \nSherborne and Moreton series. However, unexpectedly it was the Sherborne series that gave \nthe higher yields, even though the Moreton had a greater available water capacity. In the two \nwetter seasons that followed, there were no differences in yield between the two soil series. \nIn general, a nitrogen fertiliser rate of 200 kg N\/ha, which was the same as standard farm \npractice, appeared to be optimum for Twelve Acres, regardless of soil type or location within \nthe field. Therefore, variable N applications in this field might be difficult to justify. There \nwas one exception in 1998\/99, which appeared to show a higher optimum rate in at least one \nlocation within the Sherborne series. This may be a seasonal effect related to rainfall, which \nfor the May-August period was highest in 1998\/99. However, this year was also unusual in \nthat, despite autumn plant populations being higher and more uniform than in 1997\/98 or \n1999\/00, biomass assessment at GS30 showed early growth to be poorer and more variable \nbetween locations than in the other two years. \nWith no substantial differences between historically low and high yielding areas, variable \nnitrogen strategies based on historic yield were clearly not of any benefit in Twelve Acres. \nAlthough Far Sweetbrier had a more uniform soil type than Twelve Acres, there were larger \n20 \ndifferences in both yield and optimum N rate between locations within the field. However \nunlike Twelve Acres, which had three very similar wheat crops (the three varieties were all \ncomparable), there were significant changes in sowing date, previous crop, variety and range \nof N application rates in Far Sweetbrier, so comparison between the seasons is more \ncomplicated. \nThe south-western section of Far Sweetbrier was lower yielding in two out of three \nseasons (the exception being 1997\/98 which was much drier than the other two), and it \nconsistently failed to respond to more than the standard N rate. The fact that the remainder of \nthe field had an optimum N rate in excess of the standard in both 1997\/98 and 1998\/99 might \nhave been anticipated. In these two seasons the standard rates were reduced due to the wheat \ncrops being a first cereal after a break crop in 1997\/98, and then a spring sown-wheat in \n1998\/99. \nWith larger differences than Twelve Acres, the variable nitrogen strategies based on \nhistoric yield were more successful, in particular applying more N to the low yielding areas \nand less on the high yielding. This gave an average yield increase over the three years of 0.33 \nt ha-1. However, even at Far Sweetbrier, there was no benefit in the final season, because the \nstandard rate (which was higher than previously) was optimum even for low yielding areas.   \nCombining the results of the two fields gave very small returns (average \u00a33 ha-1) which \nwould be uneconomic compared to the costs of implementing precision farming management \nsystems as given in Godwin et al (2001). \nUsing shoot density as the basis of variable nitrogen applications allowed the current \ncondition of the crops to be taken in to account, rather than relying on historic trends that may \nbe diverted by seasonal factors such as rainfall differences. As with the historic yield \napproach, there was a more obvious benefit at Far Sweetbrier, where the strategy of applying \n21 \nmore N on the low shoot density areas and less on the high resulted in a yield benefit in two \nout of three seasons, averaging 0.46 ha-1. In the first season, this was complicated by lodging, \nwhich affected a significant part of the field. Furthermore, in the following two years the \naverage amount of nitrogen applied using this strategy was higher by 32 kg N ha-1. By \ncontrast, the only instance of a benefit at Twelve Acres was in 1998\/99. Here, the strategy of \napplying more N on the high density shoot areas and less on the low was beneficial simply \nbecause there were no high density shoot areas, and the saving in amount of fertiliser applied \nto the low density areas outweighed the small reduction in yield. \nInability to define areas of high shoot density in either Twelve Acres or Far Sweetbrier in \n1998\/99 and 1999\/00 highlighted the weakness of an approach based on relative rather than \nabsolute differences in shoot populations. In Twelve Acres, the range of shoot populations in \nall three years was such that it could be argued that all areas were essentially similar, having \naverage shoot density, and could therefore have received the standard field rate. As this was \nthe best strategy, an approach based on absolute shoot populations would have been effective. \nFar Sweetbrier was again complicated by having very different wheat crops, and therefore \nshoot population characteristics. \nA major outcome from these experiments was that it was clearly necessary to combine the \n\u201creal-time\u201d ADP data on relative crop structure, with appropriate benchmark values for \ndifferent wheat crops at different stages. Publication of the Wheat Growth Guide (HGCA, \n1998) provided an appropriate source of such values, and these developments enabled a \nsecond series of experiments to be conducted that examined a variable nitrogen strategy \nbased on managing wheat crop canopies according to pre-determined targets. This is reported \nin Wood et al. (2001). \n \n22 \n5 Conclusions \n \n1. Whilst there was some variation between years, related to seasonal effects, at Twelve \nAcres there was little spatial variability in yield response to N fertiliser level, despite \nthe presence of three soil series. By contrast, Far Sweetbrier with a uniform soil type \nshowed more spatial variability, and this was consistent with evidence of old field \nboundaries. \n2. Historic yield data are important for identifying consistently over or under performing \nareas. However, although there have been small benefits on occasions, depending on \nfield and season, their routine use as a basis for spatially variable nitrogen \napplications is not reliable. Over three years at Far Sweetbrier, the average yield \nincrease from a strategy based on applying more N to low yielding areas and less to \nhigh yielding areas was almost cancelled by a similar loss at Twelve Acres. \n3. Variations in crop structure can successfully be monitored in near \u201creal time\u201d by \nremote sensing, allowing the possibility of rapid alterations in mid-season agronomy \nto improve crop performance. \n4. The use of shoot density as a basis for spatially variable nitrogen applications was \nmore promising than historic yield. At Twelve Acres, shoot densities were \ncomparatively uniform across the soil series, and hence there was no yield benefit \nfrom an approach aimed at applying either more or less N to high or low density \nareas. At Far Sweetbrier, a strategy of applying more nitrogen to low density areas \nand less to high density areas (where applicable) gave an average yield increase of \n0.46 t ha-1, worth \u00a330 ha-1. \n23 \n5. The key conclusion was that it was necessary to combine the \u201creal-time\u201d data on \nrelative crop structure, obtained by remote sensing, with absolute benchmark values for \nsimilar wheat crops, and this led to the subsequent development of the experimental \nprogramme based upon managing crop canopies.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank the sponsors of this work, Home-Grown Cereals \nAuthority, Hydro-Agri and AGCO Ltd. for their support, and their collaborators, Arable \nResearch Centres and Shuttleworth Farms.
