Treatment enables positive social and\neconomic participation through which users can begin to reconstruct their\nshattered sense of social value. However, stigma remains strong, and antire-\ntroviral treatment users remain mired in conflictual symbolic relationships\nbetween the HIV\/AIDS people and the untested. To date, the restoration of\nusers\u2019 own sense of self-worth through treatment has not reduced fear and\nsexual embarrassment in framing community responses to people living with\nHIV\/AIDS. Much remains to be learned about the complex interaction of\neconomic and psychosocial dimensions of poverty, treatment availability, and\nconservative sexual moralities in driving HIV\/AIDS stigma in specific settings.\n(Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1004\u20131010. doi:10.2105\/AJPH.2010.202838)\nHow does antiretroviral treatment (ART)\naffect the ability of ART users to cope with\nHIV\/AIDS stigma? Stigma is a key driver of the\nHIV\/AIDS epidemic, particularly in low-in-\ncome settings.1,2 Psychologists have dominated\ndiscussions of its causes, foregrounding individ-\nual-level explanations, which include unrealistic\nfears of contagion and social embarrassment of\nthe sexual nature of HIV transmission.3 The\ngreatest challenge to this dominance comes from\nCastro and Farmer. In their classic 2005 article,\nthey argue that stigma is determined more by\nlack of effective health services and treatment\nthan by psychological factors, particularly in\nresource-poor settings where the sick and\ndying drain scarce community resources.4\nThey argue that access to ART enables people\nliving with HIV\/AIDS to regain potential value\nas economically and socially competent citizens\nand that as ART becomes universally acces-\nsible, stigma will gradually disappear. Since\nthis 2005 article, ART has been slowly rolled\nout,5 transforming HIV\/AIDS from a tortuous\ndeath sentence to a manageable chronic illness\nand providing researchers an opportunity to\nexplore Castro and Farmer\u2019s arguments in\nspecific contexts. We investigated the impact of\nART on users in rural Zimbabwe to explore how\ntreatment availability affects stigma in this\nsetting.\nGoffman emphasizes the need to use the\n\u2018\u2018language of social relationships rather than\nthe language of attributes\u2019\u20196 to understand\nstigma. Viewing stigma as negative social repre-\nsentations of HIV-infected people, we examined\nthe processes through which people living with\nHIV\/AIDS internalize or resist it, leading to\npositive or negative social identities. We under-\nstand social identity in terms of Cooley\u2019s notion\nof the looking glass self7 and Mead\u2019s observation\nthat social identities are heavily determined by\nhow others view us.8 A vital precondition for\nhuman well-being and agency is the recognition\nof people as having value by those around\nthem.9 Stigma arises when people are denied\nsuch recognition. We examine the extent to\nwhich the availability of ART opens up new\nmodes of positive social recognition for treatment\nusers.\nAt the time of our late 2009 study 34%\n(2010 WHO guidelines) of those needing anti-\nretroviral drugs in Zimbabwe were receiving\nthem (compared with an average of 37%\nacross sub-Saharan Africa).5,10 Many people\nliving with HIV\/AIDS remain visibly ill and\ndying, health services battle with the complex\ndemands of ART rollout, and the long-term\nfuture of heavily donor-sponsored ART services\nremains uncertain. Although it is too early to\noffer definitive comment on Castro and Farmer\u2019s\nclaims at this early stage, our study provides\nuseful preliminary insights into potential path-\nways between ART use and stigma.\nEXPLANATIONS OF STIGMA\nThe HIV\/AIDS stigma literature is vast3,11\nand incorporates 4 broad trends. Three give\nprimacy to psychosocial factors, the fourth to\nsocioeconomic factors. The first views stigma as\nthe result of ignorance, which leads to exagger-\nated fears of physical contagion. The second\nroots the othering of people living with HIV\/\nAIDS in unconscious anxieties about the un-\ncertainty of the human condition. The third links\nthese unconscious processes to wider power\nrelations.12 With its link to illicit sex and drugs,\nHIV\/AIDS is argued to constitute a symbolic\nthreat in contexts requiring the control of irra-\ntional human impulses for efficient economic\nproduction.13 In contexts of conservative sexual\nmoralities, stigma is conceptualized as society\u2019s\nsymbolic punishment for those who have\nchallenged the sexual and gendered status\nquo.14\nAlthough psychosocial explanations domi-\nnate, a fourth countertrend focuses directly\non socioeconomic and structural factors, ar-\nguing that poverty and lack of access to basic\nhealth and welfare services drive stigma.4\nThis line of argument holds that people are most\nlikely to extend compassion to the sick when\nthey have the resources to offer effective assis-\ntance.15 In resource- and service-poor areas,\nHIV\/AIDS stigma may be driven by the\nhopelessness of supporting a dying person, the\ncosts of whose care compromises the well-being\nof others. Hopelessness may also drive health\nworkers to assign stigma where there is little\nthey can do to alleviate patient suffering.16 It is\npredicted that HIV\/AIDS stigma will disappear\nin contexts of effective treatment access. Castro\nand Farmer discuss the case of a Haitian living\nwith AIDS, Samuel Morin.4 As his health\ndeteriorated, he became unable to support\nFRAMING HEALTH MATTERS\n1004 | Framing Health Matters | Peer Reviewed | Campbell et al. American Journal of Public Health | June 2011, Vol 101, No. 6\nhis family, who eventually left him. Once on ART,\nhe was able to resume a normal and economi-\ncally productive life. His family returned to him,\nand he was reintegrated into his community as\na respected, productive person.\nA recent Tanzanian study did not support\nthe argument that ART availability reduces\nstigma but found that although ART contrib-\nuted to a degree of normalization of HIV\/\nAIDS-affected people, HIV\/AIDS continued to\nbe stigmatized as a \u2018\u2018moral disease,\u2019\u2019 a label\nwhich undermined disclosure and voluntary\ncounseling and testing.17,18\nCOPING WITH STIGMA\nThe literature on how people living with\nHIV\/AIDS cope with stigma is often descrip-\ntive, presenting lists of coping mechanisms.\nAn African 5-country study19 lists emotional\nand problem-focused coping strategies that peo-\nple living with HIV\/AIDS use (e.g., turning to\nGod, rationalizing one\u2019s situation, helping others).\nWe seek to move beyond viewing coping in\nterms of decontextualized individual-level strat-\negies and conceptualize it in terms of people\u2019s\nembeddedness in wider social relations, par-\nticularly their opportunities to engage in forms of\nsocial participation that enable them to (1) access\nformal and informal social support, (2) live\nproductive and socially valued lives, and (3)\nconstruct positive social identities.20,21 Viewing\nstigma as a negative social identity arising from\nthe participation of people living with HIV\/\nAIDS in social relationships that devalue them,\nwhat opportunities does ART use open up for\nnew forms of social participation that enable\npeople living with HIV\/AIDS to have a more\npositive and empowered sense of self? HIV-\ninfected persons with positive identities are\nmost likely to be able to resist stigma, as are\nthose in supportive families and communities\nand trusted networks.22\nSeveral studies document ART users\u2019 re-\nsponses to stigma, some reporting the devel-\nopment of stigmatized identities,23,24 others\nhighlighting resistance or management of\nstigma.24\u201327 However, there has been little\nanalysis of the pathways between ART avail-\nability and resisting stigma. One exception,\nresonating with our own conceptualization of\ncoping, argues that people are able to resist\nstigma to the extent that they have access to\nsocial roles, identities, and group member-\nships to which they can ascribe positive value\nand meaning.26 This insight offers a springboard\nfor our investigation of whether and of how\nimproved ART availability provides people\nliving with HIV\/AIDS with resources and\nopportunities for social participation through\nwhich they can demonstrate their social value.\nThe advent of ART has already been found to\nrebuild the hope and motivation of demoral-\nized South African nurses.28 How has ART\naffected people living with HIV\/AIDS in Zim-\nbabwe? What pathways has it opened for more\nempowering and identity-enhancing forms of\nsocial participation?\nMETHODS\nZimbabwe is a landlocked country in\nsouthern Africa that transitioned from colonial\nto African majority rule in 1980. Initially, it\nexperienced an annual gross domestic product\ngrowth of 5%, free primary education, and\nimproved health services.29 However, from\n1999, it experienced political and economic\nturmoil. The gross domestic product declined\nby 8.0% in 2001 and 18.5% in 2003.30 Condi-\ntions have improved slightly since mid-2009 but\nremain unstable. AIDS shifted life expectancy\nfrom 61 years of age in 1992 to 42 years of age\nin 2010.31,32 The epidemic has recently stabi-\nlized, with HIV prevalence declining from 26.5%\nin 1997 to 14.3% in 200933 following reduc-\ntions in high-risk behavior.34\nThe past 6 years have seen a gradual ART\nrollout. Zimbabweans on ART increased\nfrom 99500 in 2007 to 148100 in 2008\nand 218600 by the end of 2009, an increase\nwhich represented only 34% of those who\nneeded treatment.10 Funding has been chiefly\nprovided by an expanded program of support\ncoordinated by the United Nations and financed\nby bilateral donors as well as the Zimbabwe\ngovernment. The Zimbabwe government pro-\nvides financing through the National AIDS Trust\nFund via a 1% tax levy ring-fenced for HIV\/\nAIDS management.\nWe conducted our research in Manicaland,\neastern Zimbabwe. This rural province had\nan HIV prevalence rate of 16.5% for men (17\u2013\n54 years of age) and 20.5% for women (15\u201344\nyears of age) in 2005.35 We recruited 53\npatients, 40 guardians caring for a child on\nART, and 25 nurses from 3 locations. We\nsampled patients and pediatric caregivers\nwith snowball (using village guides), opport-\nunistic (self-selected informants), and typical\ncase (adherers to ART) sampling. We re-\ncruited nurses according to their willingness\nto participate.\nFour experienced Shona-speaking field-\nworkers conducted 58 individual and 8 focus\ngroup discussions in late 2009 (Table 1).\nSemistructured topic guides focused on in-\nformants\u2019 health, career, or caregiver histo-\nries and experiences or views of HIV\/AIDS\nand ART, stigma, and health service and\ntreatment access. Individual interviews aver-\naged 1 hour and group interviews averaged\n2.3 hours. Group interviews followed a simi-\nlar topic guide; in addition, the interviewer\ninvited participants to role-play a typical\nTABLE 1\u2014Study Participant Characteristics: Evaluating and Enhancing HIV\/AIDS Treatment\nServices Study, Manicaland, Zimbabwe, 2009\nStudy Characteristics Patients Pediatric Caregivers Nurses Total\nResearch participation type\nIndividual interview, no. 19 21 18 58\nFocus group, total no.\n(no. of groups)\n34 (4) 19 (3) 7 (1) 60 (8)\nTotal participants, no. 53 40 25 118\nAverage age, y 44 54 41 46\nWomen, no. 32 38 11 81\nMen, no. 21 2 14 37\nFRAMING HEALTH MATTERS\nJune 2011, Vol 101, No. 6 | American Journal of Public Health Campbell et al. | Peer Reviewed | Framing Health Matters | 1005\npatient-nurse interaction in the ART\ncontext.\nWe recorded, transcribed, and translated\nthe interviews. Thematic network analysis36\ngenerated 225 codes clustered into an increas-\ningly inclusive set of 22 basic and 4 global\nthemes that reflect the pathways through which\nART enables users to cope with or resist stigma\n(Table 2).\nGiven that research participation was\nvoluntary with recruitment from clinic\nsettings, our sample was probably biased\ntoward regular, highly motivated clinic at-\ntendees who had overcome multiple barriers\nto access and adherence (including stigma,\ntransportation costs, opportunity costs, and\nhigh consultation fees: US$1.00 per month,\nwhere the average person lives on less than\nUS$2.00 per month; M. Skovdal, C. Campbell,\nK. Nhongo et al., unpublished data, study\ncompleted in 2009). As social constructionist\nresearchers,37 rather than seeking to generate\nstereotypical characterizations of all mem-\nbers of a statistically representative sample,\nwe sought to produce a fine-grained study of\nthe diverse ways that 1 group of ART users\nwas responding to stigma in 1 setting.\nRESULTS\nAlthough ART opened up many opportuni-\nties for people living with HIV\/AIDS to resist\nstigma, our research participants emphasized\nthat stigma remains powerful and that coping\nwith it presents a constant and formidable\nchallenge. Contrary to Castro and Farmer\u2019s\nfindings,4 informants explained stigma in terms\nof the 2 factors most frequently mentioned by\npsychologists: a deep fear of infection and the\nsexually transmitted nature of HIV\/AIDS. The\nlatter often led to deep humiliation from the\nloss of dignity that \u2018\u2018promiscuity\u2019\u2019 implies in\nthis context. In abject poverty, with little ac-\ncess to material sources of social status, social\nrespectability plays a key role in the con-\nstruction of social value and personhood and\nis closely linked to a conservative sexual\nmorality. Although there was a degree of\ntolerance for sexual transgressors, people\nwere expected to be discreet in their trans-\ngressions. Those who were not were subject\nto varying combinations of delight at their\nmisfortune, gossip, denigration, or outright\nTABLE 2\u2014Pathways Through Which Antiretrovirals Empower Users, by Global Theme:\nEvaluating and Enhancing HIV\/AIDS Treatment Services Study, Manicaland,\nZimbabwe, 2009\nBasic Themes Organizing Themes\nImproved HIV management (global theme 1)\nImproved ART availability.\nMore people test for HIV.\nMany people living with HIV\/AIDS are satisfied with\nthe quality of health services.\nAvailability and quality of HIV services.\nFollowing counseling, ART users are more likely to\ndisclose and live positively.\nPatient satisfaction, disclosure, confidence\nBeing able to offer effective help to people\nliving with HIV\/AIDS motivates nurses.\nMany nurses take pride and pleasure in\nseeing patients progress.\nNurses feel motivated by ART.\nART users actively participate in HIV management (global theme 2)\nART users strive to work with nurses on achieving\ntreatment goals.\nART users participate in support groups.\nART users comply with health services to qualify for\nfood aid.\nART users negotiate support from nongovernmental organizations.\nPatients engage with support services.\nART users have considerable knowledge about\nAIDS and ART, which they use to educate others.\nART users actively encourage others to get tested\nand help them come to terms with their status.\nGive advice and encourage testing\nART users lead normal and productive lives (global theme 3)\nThe livelihoods of ART users are often sustained\nthrough subsistence farming.\nMany patients take pride in their ability to actively engage\nin formal or informal work.\nART users are economically active and can sustain\nthemselves and contribute to society.\nPatients see themselves as living normal lives and capable\nof doing the same things as uninfected people.\nMany patients repeatedly emphasize their capacity to\nengage in microfinance and farming activities.\nART users seek to normalize their circumstances by\nrejecting differences between ingroup and outgroup\nART users construct positive identities (global theme 4)\nAcceptance by many ART users of their own and their\ninfected children\u2019s HIV status feeds into positive living.\nART users want to display their positive living skills to\nchallenge stigma.\nART users seek to resist stereotypes.\nART users avoid exposing others to the risk of HIV.

The sexual element lay at the root of\nwhat was widely regarded as the \u2018\u2018laughable\u2019\u2019\nfall from grace of people who had, in their pre-\nHIV\/AIDS lives, been \u2018\u2018proud\u2019\u2019 and behaved\n\u2018\u2018as if they were worthy of respect and\ndignity.\u2019\u2019\nThey laugh at us behind our backs, saying, \u2018\u2018Look\nthey used to be pompous, to think that they were\n\u2018a somebody\u2019\u2014now they are paying the price!\u2019\u2019\n(Telder, patient)\nMen experienced this loss of status as par-\nticularly devastating.38\nI did not want to be tested because I would lose\nmy dignity as a father to my kids. I would also\nlose respect from my wife and the community,\nwho would view me as a promiscuous and\nuseless man. The pride we have of being father\nand head of family\u2014an HIV-positive result\nwashes away all that respect. (Jotan, patient)\nHowever, while emphasizing ignorance and\nsexual embarrassment as drivers of stigma,\npeople often spoke of how ART enabled the\neconomic rehabilitation of people living with\nHIV\/AIDS, giving them the confidence to resist\nstigma and to restore their own, and some-\ntimes the community\u2019s, sense of themselves as\ndignified persons of social value. Our data\nsuggest an interaction between the economic\nand the psychosocial in shaping peoples\u2019 fall\nfrom social respect as well as the possibility\nof its restoration. We follow the structure of\nTable 2 in developing these points.\nImproved HIV Management\nUnsurprisingly, the availability of lifesaving\ndrugs that transform HIV\/AIDS from a slow\nand often agonizing death sentence to a chronic\nand manageable disease has provided patients,\ncaregivers, and nurses a renewed trust in their\nhealth services.\nThe availability of ART has transformed how\nHIV\/AIDS is viewed. People feel able to disclose\ntheir status because they know drugs will be\ngiven at no cost. Before this, people viewed HIV\nsufferers as people merely waiting to die. (Farisai,\npatient)\nDespite carrying heavy responsibilities in\na context where doctors are in short supply,\nnurses welcomed the job satisfaction and positive\nnurse-patient relationships enabled by ART.\nOne guy who first came in a wheelchair is now\nwalking and looking fit. It is very satisfying to\nwork with HIV sufferers on ART. We build\nrelationships with them because they come back\nevery month, and we see them progressing\ntowards recovery. (Esther, nurse)\nMost ART users spoke of outstanding service\nfrom nurses, commenting on their concern, pa-\ntience, and interest in prioritizing patients living\nwith HIV\/AIDS.39\nAntiretroviral Users Actively Participate\nin HIV Management\nART rollout opens opportunities for users of\nantiretroviral drugs to participate in HIV\/AIDS\nmanagement. Such involvement not only allows\nthe best possible outcomes for their own health\nbut also helps them support others, providing\nthem with a platform to exercise agency, build\nsocial capital, and renegotiate stigmatized iden-\ntities. ART users\u2019 interaction with nurses is\na particularly important area in which the\nagency of ART users is played out. ART users\nare fully aware of how nurses perceive \u2018\u2018a good\npatient\u2019\u2019 (e.g., one who attended on given re-\nview dates, adhered to treatment plans, and\nanswered nurses and counselors truthfully dur-\ning review meetings), and many worked hard to\nfulfill this role to ensure optimal care.\nIf the nurse thinks you are not a good patient,\nthey will not even listen to what you have to say.\n(Grace, patient)\nWhen I was in hospital, all the nurses wanted to\nserve me, they would always rush to my bed.\nThey enjoyed talking to me because I obeyed\nwhat they were saying. (Rufaro, woman patient)\nPatients also worked actively to negotiate\nsupport from community-based services (e.g.,\ndisclosing their status to nongovernmental\norganizations to access food aid). Ironically,\ntheir right to access this prized assistance in\na poverty-stricken community elicited envy\nfrom others and gave them a degree of social\nstatus.\nWhen food donations came, they asked for\nverification of people\u2019s HIV status. Those who\nwere sick and had not gone to the hospital\nrushed to the hospital to get tested. (Karren,\npatient)\nThe uninfected feel jealous that we get this food\nassistance. (Mercy, patient)\nSeveral patients repeatedly referred to their\npositive engagement with community-based\nsupport groups that nurses, HIV\/AIDS coun-\nselors, and patients established to facilitate\noptimal ART adherence. Group members\nsupported each other and advised new ART\nusers on coming to terms with their status and\nrigid treatment plans and on how to access\nhelp. Groups also provided patients and pedi-\natric caregivers with opportunities to meet\nsimilar others and participate in joint income-\ngenerating activities.\nIn our support group, we share ideas and our\nexperiences on how to take care of these children\nproperly and how they can live longer. We also\nhave different projects to raise income and to\ngenerate things for domestic use like chicken and\nrabbit rearing. (Marie, pediatric caregiver)\nMany spoke of their duty to disseminate\nunderstandings arising from their own experi-\nences, processed through dialog with support\ngroup peers, to educate and support commu-\nnity members who still saw HIV\/AIDS as\na terminal illness and refused to be tested. This\nrole gave them a positive sense of performing\na vital and lifesaving community service.\nAntiretroviral Users Lead Normal and\nProductive Lives\nInformants repeatedly spoke of how ART\nhad enabled them to regain their physical\nhealth, allowing them to participate in eco-\nnomic activities that challenged people\u2019s per-\nceptions of people living with HIV\/AIDS as\na drain on society. The opportunity to prove\ntheir economic competence dramatically re-\nformed their perceived social value.\nPeople still do look down upon us. If we can\nengage in income-generating projects, they will\nsee that even though we are ill, we are still\nproductive. We can grow all the vegetables we\nneed and feed our chickens and sell them.\n(Everline, patient)\nART enabled some informants to resume or\nbegin formal employment\u2014as a police officer,\ntailor, bus driver, and nurse. Although most\nusers engaged in subsistence farming, several\nwere actively seeking nongovernmental orga-\nnization support to establish additional in-\ncome-generating activities. These endeavors\nwould not only cover the costs of monthly\nART reviews, food, and medicines for oppor-\ntunistic infections but also help them prove\ntheir worth, not least through being able to\ncontribute to family support. ART users em-\nphasized that living with HIV\/AIDS did not\ndiminish their relationship with their family\nand linked their ability to participate in\nFRAMING HEALTH MATTERS\nJune 2011, Vol 101, No. 6 | American Journal of Public Health Campbell et al. | Peer Reviewed | Framing Health Matters | 1007\nproductive activities to their family\u2019s long-\nterm well-being.\nAntiretroviral Users Construct Positive\nIdentities\nIn striving for normalization and proof of\ntheir social worth, ART users worked hard to\nresist society\u2019s efforts to depict them as\n\u2018\u2018devalued others.\u2019\u2019 They spent a lot of time\ndiscussing the boundaries between \u2018\u2018us\u2019\u2019 (peo-\nple living with HIV\/AIDS) and \u2018\u2018them\u2019\u2019 (those\nwithout HIV\/AIDS) to construct positive iden-\ntities and resist stereotypes. However, the pro-\ncess was often defensive, with people either\nrepeatedly asserting that they \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t care\u2019\u2019 what\nothers thought of them or responding to per-\nceived insult or denigration through a process of\ncounterstigma. This involved the often very\nintensely felt vilification of \u2018\u2018the untested\u2019\u2019 who\nsought to stigmatize them. In this way the newly\nempowered identities that ART use enabled\nwere often counteridentities built on the con-\ntinuation of ill will rather than representing the\nrestoration of ART users\u2019 dignified place in\na harmonious social order.\nBefore examining the conflictual nature of\nsome coping responses, we emphasize the very\nreal sense of empowerment people repeatedly\nmentioned.\nPersonally I don\u2019t really care, and I don\u2019t really\nview it as an issue when people refer to us as\n\u2018\u2018those people with HIV\/AIDS.\u2019\u2019 If they say that in\nmy presence I just say, \u2018\u2018Here I am, I am one of\nthose people, and I have accepted my situation\nand I am ready to let everybody know.\u2019\u2019 (Stephen,\npatient)\nTo be honest we \u2018\u2018the AIDS people\u2019\u2019 no longer\ncare, and we don\u2019t really mind what they say; in\nfact we even find it funny that some people refer\nto us that way\u2014we often laugh about it. It is\nactually helping us to cope. (Florence, patient)\nNot everyone was able to dismiss stigma\nas confidently however; several stressed that\nHIV\/AIDS-affected people should actively\nstrive to counter negative stereotypes, work\nhard to look fit and healthy, and avoid behav-\niors that might alienate others.\nWe shouldn\u2019t be among those AIDS-affected\npeople who people see as \u2018\u2018about to die.\u2019\u2019 We\nshould be seen to have good health so people are\nsurprised when we tell them we are HIV positive.\n(Karren, patient)\nWhen your body has sores and you are bleeding,\nit\u2019s best not to touch other peoples\u2019 food even if\nyou want to, because it gives people a reason to\ncomplain. (Jane, pediatric caregiver and patient)\nA key identity-strengthening strategy that\n\u2018\u2018we, the AIDS people\u2019\u2019 (as ART users often\ndescribe themselves) use is their confident\nassertion of their superior courage compared\nwith those they dismissively referred to as \u2018\u2018the\nuntested\u2019\u2019 (Violet, patient). They proudly\ndepicted themselves as those who had the\ncourage to overcome their fears and take\naction against HIV\/AIDS\u2014assuming that\nmany of the untested were also likely to be\nHIV positive. Their characterization of them-\nselves as a small, socially responsible elite who\nhad taken control of their health status\nprovided many with a strong sense of posi-\ntive agency. Furthermore, support group\nmembers said being open about their status\nhad gained them significant and welcome\nsupport from similar others. They no longer\nfelt isolated, proudly styling themselves as\neducated through having acquired health-\nenhancing knowledge compared with\nthose who deliberately chose not to know\nthis.\nI am now happy and feel I have regained my\nsocial position. My only plea is for continued HIV\nawareness to enlighten those blind people. By\nthese I mean those untested people who like to\nthink they are OK. I call them blind because they\nwould rather wait until they fall ill to find out the\ntruth of their situation. (Violet, patient)\nI don\u2019t really care what these people say because\nif somebody says something degrading to me, I\nask them whether they have been tested for HIV.\nIf they have not been tested, then they don\u2019t\nknow their status and that makes me better than\nthem because I already know mine. I have taken\nthat responsibility. (Caroline, patient)\nThis pride in knowing their status helped\nmany turn the tables, mocking or pitying the\nuntested who would unnecessarily die of AIDS.\nHaving \u2018\u2018made the right decision\u2019\u2019 (Caroline)\nenabled them to \u2018\u2018laugh at those who sought to\nlaugh at us\u2019\u2019 (Florence).\nWe were tested in 2003, and that\u2019s when we\nstarted ART. There were people who thought I\nwas not going to last long. Yet I was already on\nART and recovering well. Some of the very\npeople who laughed at me have themselves\nalready died, and yet I am here (general laugh-\nter). (Stephen, patient)\nOther community members noted their\ngrowing confidence and refusal to be ashamed.\nYou hear people making sarcastic comments like\n\u2018\u2018These AIDS people are now parading their\nstatus, as if having AIDS were beneficial\u2019\u2019 . . .\npeople even accuse us of bragging about our\nAIDS. (Florence, patient)\nDISCUSSION\nViewing coping in terms of opportunities\nfor positive social participation,20 we have\nexamined how treatment availability may\nopen up forms of positive community en-\ngagement that enable people living with HIV\/\nAIDS to repair their shattered social identities.\nMany ART users have successfully built\nrewarding and positive relationships with\nmotivated and supportive nurses, enabling\nthem to gain optimal benefit from the health\ncare system. They have also derived a sense\nof agency, and material benefit, through\nsuccessfully negotiating with nongovern-\nmental organizations for food parcels in\na community challenged by poverty and\nhunger. They have given and received vital\ninformation and social support through\nparticipation in support groups as well as\nderiving the will and confidence to act as\npositive health advocates to other commu-\nnity members. Their improved physical\nhealth means both they and others can see\nthey are capable of living economically\nproductive lives, which is vitally impor-\ntant in conditions of tremendous poverty.\nTheir sense of having some kind of control\nover their health enables people to con-\nstruct an empowering distinction between\n\u2018\u2018us\u2019\u2019 (the self-identified \u2018\u2018AIDS people\u2019\u2019)\nand \u2018\u2018them\u2019\u2019 (the often hostile and untested\nother).\nTreatment availability gives many ART\nusers a renewed sense of social value, in-\ncluding confidence in their previously com-\npromised abilities to engage in housework,\nsubsistence farming, or formal work where\navailable.

However,\ngiven the complexities of the human emo-\ntional response to sexuality and the predomi-\nnantly sexual mode of HIV transmission, it\nseems likely that the positive effects of economic\nempowerment will always be tempered by\npsychosocial factors in shaping both community\nresponses to HIV\/AIDS and the likelihood of\nstigma.13,14 Here we emphasize that we are in\nfull agreement with Castro and Farmer\u2019s em-\nphasis on the vital role of treatment availability\nin stigma reduction and their insistence on the\nrole of economic and structural factors in\nshaping community responses to illness. We\nwould certainly not seek to deny the role of\npoverty and of lack of treatment in shaping\nsuch responses; however, psychosocial factors\nwill always mediate economic determinants of\ncommunity responses to HIV\/AIDS. Much\nremains to be learned about the complex in-\nteraction of the economic and the psychosocial\nin driving HIV\/AIDS stigma in conditions of\npoverty. j\nAbout the Authors\nCatherine Campbell and Morten Skovdal are with the\nHealth, Community, and Development Group, Institute of\nSocial Psychology, London School of Economics and\nPolitical Science, London, UK.
