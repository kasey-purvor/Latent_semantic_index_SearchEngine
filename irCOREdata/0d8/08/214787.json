In this article, we seek to provide new \ninsights into how geography shapes these spatio-temporal variations, focusing on two \nleading examples of codified voluntarism: ISO14001 and the Global Compact (GC). \nAdvancing on previous quantitative studies, which have analyzed domestic and non-\ndomestic influences separately, we examine how the internal attributes of place \u201ccondition\u201d \nthe influence of transnational spatial interdependencies. We find that higher levels of \nISO14001 certification in other economies are more likely to spillover (via transnational \nlinkages) into higher domestic uptake of the standard in wealthier economies, while \ndomestic receptivity to the influence of higher GC adoptions abroad is greater in more \ndemocratic countries. Another important advance on previous studies is that we examine \nthe influence of a larger number of measures of transnational economic linkage. Providing \nevidence of \u201ctrading-up\u201d and \u201cinvesting-up\u201d dynamics, we show that higher densities of \nISO14001 certificates and GC participants in a country\u2019s export and inward FDI partners is \nassociated with higher levels of domestic uptake of the respective standard. We also find \ntentative evidence of \u201cvisiting-up\u201d dynamics associated with the cross-border movement of \nbusinesspeople.  \n 2\nIntroduction\nAn important feature of the past two decades has been the growth of voluntary corporate \nresponsibility (CR) standards governing the behavior of firms in areas such as \nenvironmental sustainability, labor rights and corruption (Angel et al., 2007; \nChristopherson and Lillie, 2005; Hughes et al., 2007; Klooster, 2006; Nadvi, 2008). \nArguably the most prominent amongst these expressions of corporate voluntarism have \nbeen \u201cglobal\u201d standards, such as the Global Compact (GC), ISO14001, Responsible Care \nand SA9000. Although so-called because they can be implemented by firms all over the \nworld, a common feature of global standards has been geographic unevenness in their \nuptake (Bennie et al., 2007; Delmas and Montiel, 2008; Neumayer and Perkins, 2004; \nStringer, 2006). \nUnderstanding variations in the uptake of CR standards \u2013 both across time and \nspace \u2013 has spawned a quantitative research literature, which has sought to explain \ngeographic unevenness in terms of spatio-temporal diffusion processes (Albuquerque et al., \n2007; Corbett and Kirsch, 2001; Delmas and Montiel, 2008; Neumayer and Perkins, 2004; \nPotoski and Prakash, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006, 2007). Our large-N, econometric \ncontribution in the present article advances on this previous work in three important areas. \nFirst, we attempt to provide a more realistic test of how transnational flows of information, \nnorms and pressures influence the domestic uptake of CR standards. Unique to the \nliterature, therefore, our study uses an interactive model specification whereby the \ninfluence of standard adoption in other states working through transnational linkages is \n\u201cconditioned\u201d by domestic contextual factors of wealth and democracy.  \n 3\nA second contribution is that we analyze three measures of transnational economic \nlinkages through which global standards might plausibly \u201cspillover\u201d (i.e. diffuse) from one \ncountry to another. These are exports and inward foreign direct investment (FDI), both of \nwhich have featured in previous studies, and international business travel, which has not. \nImportantly, we go beyond a number of previous studies, which have relied on aggregate \nmeasures of total transnational linkages. Instead, we make use of bilateral data to construct \nspatial lag variables, which capture the density of standard adoption in foreign countries \nweighted by the degree of connectivity to other states (Corbett and Kirsch, 2001; Delmas \nand Montiel, 2008; Moon and deLeon, 2005; Neumayer and Perkins, 2004). \nA third advance is to examine two global standards with very different \ncharacteristics: ISO14001 and the GC. The GC has only been the subject of a single study \nwhich, rather than examining spatio-temporal variations across countries, focuses on \nuneven participation amongst Forbes Global 2000 list companies (Bennie et al., 2007). \nThrough the use of a common methodology, we provide new insights into whether cross-\nnational disparities in the uptake of standards with very different characteristics \u2013 ISO \n14001 and the GC \u2013 are shaped by similar factors and to a similar degree. \n \nISO14001 and the GC in Comparative Perspective \nCR standards are non-state mandated regulatory institutions governing the behavior of \nfirms (Cashore, 2002; Christopherson and Lillie, 2005; Hebb and W\u00f3jcik, 2005; Kollman \nand Prakash, 2002). Also termed voluntary codes, they operate at a number of spatial \nscales, and cover a multitude of issues (Angel et al., 2007; Nadvi, 2008). CR standards \ncodify a set of rules, roles and expectations in areas of public concern \u2013 such as \n 4\nenvironmental protection, labor rights, anti-corruption and reporting \u2013 not adequately \naddressed by public law. They signal that a company and\/or its products and services are \nallied to certain \u201cstandards\u201d of procedure, performance or commitment (Bansal and Hunter, \n2003; Christopherson and Lillie, 2005; Stringer, 2006). Standards allow firms to better \ncomply with stakeholder demands, establish their credentials as good corporate citizens, \nand create competitively-valuable reputational assets. Moreover, they offer a means for \nlead firms to manage extra-economic aspects of international value chains, in that \nuniversally-applicable standards can be used as a basis for specifying, monitoring and \nverifying the CR of suppliers and subcontractors (Hughes et al., 2007; Nadvi, 2008). \n Our particular concern in the present article is on two influential global standards \naddressing aspects of CR: ISO14001 and the GC. We chose these standards because they \nare leaders in their respective fields. ISO14001 is the most widely-adopted standard \nspecifically addressing aspects of corporate environmental management, while the GC is \nthe world\u2019s foremost corporate citizenship initiative. At the same time, significant \ndifferences exist between the standards, both in their aims, procedural requirements and \nassurance mechanisms.  \nReleased in 1995, ISO14001 is a process-based environmental management system \n(EMS) developed and promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization \n(ISO). Briefly, an EMS comprises a set of formalized and systematized procedures \ndesigned to help firms reduce their environmental impacts (Moon and deLeon, 2005). \nISO14001 \u201cstandardizes\u201d these procedures with the aim of providing a universally accepted \nframework for continually improving environmental performance that can be implemented \nworldwide. Organizations wishing to declare themselves ISO14001 certified must undergo \n 5\nsix steps: (1) create an environmental policy; (2) assess current environmental impacts, \nliabilities and legal compliance; (3) create an internal management system; (4) periodically \naudit and review environmental performance; (5) prepare a public statement declaring that \nISO14001 is being implemented; and (6) employ a registered auditor to confirm that the \norganization\u2019s procedures are consistent with the documented EMS (Neumayer and \nPerkins, 2004). This last verification stage is known as certification.  \nThe GC, released in 2000, is organized under the aegis of the United Nations (UN). \nUnlike ISO14001, the Compact does not prescribe formal procedures, but a set of ten \ngeneric principles which are intended to guide the practices of corporations. The principles, \nwhich derive from fundamental international treaties and declarations, cover four areas of \nbusiness-society relations: human rights (principles 1-2); labor (3-6); environment (7-9); \nand anti-corruption (10). By encouraging firms to embed a set of universal, shared values \ninto their strategy and operations, the Compact seeks to promote more responsible, \ninclusive forms of global corporate citizenship. In order to become a publicly-listed \nparticipant, a company\u2019s chief executive officer needs to send a letter to the UN\u2019s Secretary \nGeneral, \u2018expressing support for the Global Compact and its principles\u2019 (UN, 2008a). \nUnlike ISO14001, however, compliance is not independently monitored, verified and \nassured by third-parties. Moreover, although participants are obliged to periodically submit \na report detailing actions that they have taken to achieve the Compact\u2019s goals, the UN does \nnot monitor or measure the performance of participants.  \nOf the two standards, ISO14001 has by far proved the most popular, even taking \naccount of the fact that the standard was released earlier. As of the end of 2005, the last \nyear of our sample, there were 1000 active firms in the GC. By comparison, at the \n 6\nequivalent number of years after the introduction of ISO14001 (i.e. end of 2000), there \nwere approximately 22,500 certified firms. Yet, as shown in figures 1 and 2 which \nrespectively depict the domestic density of ISO14001 and the GC (i.e. country-level \nadoption counts normalized by population), these aggregate statistics mask significant \nvariations across countries. Our central goal is to explain these variations which, we argue, \nare best understood as an example of geographically uneven diffusion.  \n \nConventional Approaches to Diffusion and their Shortcomings\nPrevious large-N, quantitative work concerned with the diffusion of organizational \nstandards has sought to model spatio-temporal unevenness in terms of two sets of \nexplanatory factors: external and internal (e.g. Guler et al., 2002). The former capture the \ninfluence of actors in other states whose adoption decisions, it is suggested, \u201cspillover\u201d \nacross borders by directly or indirectly altering the optimal choices of domestic actors \n(Pitlik, 2007, 164). Internal determinants, on the other hand, refer to domestic, territorially-\nbound attributes which accelerate or impede the domestic uptake of new innovations. \nUnderstanding diffusion in terms of external determinants, on the one hand, and internal \ndeterminants, on the other hand, is undoubtedly useful, drawing attention to two different \naspects of \u201cgeography\u201d that contribute to the uneven grounding of global standards \namongst organizations located in particular territorial spaces. Yet, by failing to consider the \nways in which domestic and extra-territorial influences might interact, previous studies into \nthe diffusion of standards have potentially provided an unrealistic account of how \ngeographic unevenness is produced. \n 7\nOur point of departure in the present article is to argue that, as well as acting as \nindependent determinants in their own right, internal and external influences are likely to \ncombine. In particular, we anticipate the impact of external influences to be conditioned by \ncertain domestic attributes, with the latter amplifying or attenuating the influence of the \nformer. To take one example: the sale of goods to a country which has a high number of \nadoptions of ISO14001\/GC may expose firms in the exporting country to new knowledge \nabout the standard. Yet the extent to which domestic corporate managers respond to this \ninformation will plausibly depend on place-based, contextual factors which influence the \nlocal demand for CR or firms\u2019 ability to supply this demand. The domestic context, in other \nwords, is likely to define receptivity to transnational influences. \nSimilar points have been made by scholars in other contexts (O'Loughlin et al., \n1998; Bridge, 2002). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to explore the \nconditioning role of domestic attributes on extra-territorial influences in the diffusion of \norganizational standards. In the next section, we explore the sources of external influences, \nfocusing on transnational contact, communication and exchange.  \n \nThe Ties that Diffuse \nA core theme of the literature is that cross-national diffusion occurs where adoption in other \ncountries stimulates domestic adoption. One stream of work identifies these \u201cother\u201d states \nas ones which are equivalent in terms of socio-cultural, political and\/or economic \ncharacteristics (Albuquerque et al., 2007; Guler et al., 2002). Another set of explanations \npoint to countries where the innovation in question has, or appears to have, proved \nsuccessful (Pitlik, 2007; Simmons and Elkins, 2004). A third set of explanations emphasize \n 8\nvarious forms of transnational contact, communication and exchange (Mosley and Uno, \n2007; Potoski and Prakash, 2004). \nWe focus on this third category because we believe the theoretical arguments \nsupporting the influence of transnationally linked countries are stronger than for other \n\u201creference\u201d category accounts. Additionally, the role of certain boundary-spanning \nconnectivities in accelerating the domestic uptake of standards has previously been \ndemonstrated in a number of large-N, quantitative studies (Albuquerque et al., 2007; \nNeumayer and Perkins, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006, 2007).  \nFollowing Simmons and Elkins (2004), we point to two mechanisms through which \ntransnational contact, communication and exchange with other countries might plausibly \ngive rise to cross-border spillovers: altered payoffs and information. Altered payoffs are \nhypothesized to arise where uptake of an innovation by actors in country A increases its \nrelative profitability to potential adopters in country B. Altered payoffs may be financial, \nwith adoption in other countries increasing the commercial value of a particular standard, or \nreducing the financial costs of implementation (Bennie et al., 2007; Clark et al., 2001). \nAltered payoffs may also be reputational, and bound-up with corporate actors\u2019 quest for \n\u201clegitimacy\u201d amongst important stakeholders, with uptake in other countries helping to \ndomestically institutionalize particular standards as \u201cbest\u201d or \u201cappropriate\u201d practice (Guler \net al., 2002; Mendel, 2002). \nA second mechanism implicated in cross-national spillovers by Simmons and \nElkins (2004) is new information. Transnational contact, communication and exchange \nwith adopters may increase cross-national learning about the existence, profitability and \npractical feasibility of CR standards. On the supply-side, such learning may provide ideas \n 9\nabout how standards can help to address existing management challenges. On the demand-\nside, transnational learning may impart new information, ideas and templates about existing \napproaches to corporate social and environmental responsibility adopted elsewhere, \npotentially altering stakeholder expectations, demands and norms of appropriateness.  \nWhether through one or (more likely) both of these mechanisms, we suggest that the \ndegree to which adoption in one country spills-over into another country will depend on \ntwo factors. One is the density of foreign adopters (Perkins and Neumayer, 2004; Prakash \nand Potoski, 2007). Linkages to countries with a comparatively high number of ISO14001 \ncertificates or GC participants per capita are more likely to increase the payoffs from \nadoption or expand the availability of relevant information. Another salient determinant is \nthe degree of transnational interdependence in terms of the level of boundary-spanning ties \n(Guler et al., 2002; Neumayer and Perkins, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006). Domestic \nactors are more likely to be influenced to implement a standard by adopters in other \ncountries where they interact, communicate and exchange with them more.  \n \nTrade \nPrevious studies have ascribed a central role for exports in the domestic uptake of global \nCR standards arising from a \u201ctrading-up\u201d effect (Vogel, 1997). According to this line of \nargument, exports may lead to a ratcheting-up of regulatory standards, so long as a \ncountry\u2019s important trading partners have stringent environmental policies (Prakash and \nPotoski, 2006).  \nTrading-up dynamics are typically theorized in terms of altered payoffs. Hence it is \nsuggested that firms exporting to countries with a high number of adopters of CR standards \n 10\nwill face heightened economic incentives to follow suit by adopting similar standards. Most \ncommonly these incentives are portrayed as emanating from the purchasing preferences or \nrequirements of foreign buyers for their suppliers to adopt standards similar to those widely \nimplemented in their own country (Coe and Wrigley, 2007; Mendel, 2002; Nadvi, 2008; \nPrakash and Potoski, 2006; Stringer, 2006). Yet high levels of uptake in important export \nmarkets might also drive domestic adoption by changing domestic expectations of \nprofitability with domestic firms taking cues regarding their technical or economic \nproperties from companies in key exports markets (Kollman and Prakash, 2002). Indeed, \ngrowing levels of uptake in export markets might set in motion a competitive bandwagon, \nas firms adopt out of fear that their foreign counterparts will otherwise gain a competitive \nadvantage (O\u2019Neill et al., 1998).  \nImplicit in the above is the idea that export ties create boundary-spanning \ncommunication networks which act as conduits for the spread of new information. Via \nthese network ties, firms may learn about the range of organizations which have \nimplemented a particular standard in export markets, together with its relative popularity. \nThey may also gain new understanding about the commercial benefits of standards, e.g. via \neasily-codified \u201csuccess stories\u201d of companies in export markets which have profitably \nimplemented ISO14001 or the GC.  \n \nForeign direct investment  \nWhile discussions of upwards convergence have typically focused on trade, recent work \nhas switched attention to inward FDI and the potential for \u201cinvesting-up\u201d (Prakash and \nPotoski, 2007). Through outward FDI, TNCs can directly \u201cexport\u201d standards to host \n 11\neconomies, implementing voluntary CR standards in their foreign affiliates and subsidiaries \n(Bridge, 2002; Garcia-Johnson, 2000). Amongst the reasons why TNCs might choose to \ndeploy an internationally-recognized standard throughout their geographically dispersed \nnetwork of operations are: to meet local and extra-local stakeholder expectations (Angel et \nal., 2007; Bansal and Hunter, 2003); to create competitively-valuable \u201corganizational \nlegitimacy\u201d in host economies (Coe and Wrigley, 2007), providing firms with a \u201csocial \nlicense to operate and expand\u201d; and to save on transaction costs associated with operating \ndifferent self-regulatory practices in different countries (Angel et al., 2007).  \nThe presence of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries in the host economy may also be \ninstrumental in changing domestic payoffs. Within this capacity, TNCs may use local firms \nwhich have adopted a familiar standard as preferred suppliers, or refuse to procure from \nthose which have not (Jeppesen and Hansen, 2004). Foreign affiliates and subsidiaries \ncould also trigger adoption through mimetic effects, as domestic firms \u201ccopy\u201d specific CR \nstandards believed to grant foreign transnationals a competitive advantage. Such dynamics, \nwhereby firms competitively emulate rivals in the host economy, have been documented in \nother contexts (Coe and Wrigley, 2007).Likewise, domestic firms may imitate TNCs for \nreputational reasons, adopting a particular standard in order to align themselves with the \nprogressive management practices of their high-reputation foreign counterparts. \nTNCs can also diffuse new information which, directly or indirectly, stimulates \nadoption of a particular standard by domestic firms. Through the local presence of \ntransnationals who are adopters, domestic firms may not only learn about the existence of \nISO14001 or the GC, but also their benefits. Equally significant, TNCs may help to \n 12\nredefine the expectations of firms amongst civil society, demonstrating the availability, \noperation and outcomes of CR standards (Garcia-Johnson, 2000; Perkins, 2007).  \n \nBusiness travel \nAlthough largely neglected in recent work into the diffusion of voluntary CR standards, it is \nour contention that international flows of businesspeople from countries where there is a \nhigh density of a particular CR standard may have a \u201cvisiting-up\u201d effect, fostering higher \nlevels of domestic uptake. First and foremost, this is likely to derive from the role of \ntravelers as cross-border carriers of new information (Bunnell and Coe, 2001; Currah and \nWrigley, 2004). In their meetings, conversations and dealings, foreign business visitors \nmay well convey information about the existence, uses and wider commercial benefits of \nparticular standards (Bryson, 2000). Received through direct, interpersonal contact, such \ninformation is likely to carry more credibility, and therefore have greater influence than \ndistanciated forms of communication. Through face-to-face interactions \u2013 which are known \nto be important in diffusing \u201ccultural\u201d and \u201cbehavioral\u201d norms across geographic borders \n(Jones, 2007, 241) \u2013 businesspeople may also be instrumental in socializing domestic \nmanagers into CR as best practice, and part-and-parcel of the legitimate responsibility of \nmodern, progressive business organizations (Mendel, 2002). More generally, the mobility \nof businesspeople across national borders may help to transfer information, including tacit \nknowledge developed through prior experience with standards in other countries (Bryson, \n2000; Gertler 2003). Such knowledge could well accelerate domestic uptake by lowering \nthe associated information and implementation costs of a particular standard. \n 13\n Inevitably, business travel will be functionally bound-up with both exports and \ninwards FDI, both of which frequently depend on the movement of people across national \nborders. However, geographic patterns of business travel are unlikely to be identical to \nthose of trade and investment, such that it cannot be treated as a catch-all measure of the \ngeometry and intensity of these linkages combined. Thus, the amount of business travel \nassociated with trade and investment is likely to vary across countries, while certain forms \nof business travel (e.g. business association conference travel, visits to trade fairs) may only \nbe partly related, or even entirely unrelated, to trade and FDI. Hence we believe that it \nmakes sense to analyze business travel as a variable in its own right in the present article. \n \nThe Conditioning Context  \nIn the present article, we focus on two domestic, contextual factors, GDP per capita and \ndemocracy, which we model as interacting with the transnational link-weighted spatial lags. \nWealth and democracy are broad-based attributes, whose influence operates through a \nnumber of different channels which, theoretically, conceptually and empirically, have been \nimplicated in shaping (uneven) patterns of standard adoptions. They are also two variables \nat the heart of social science research, respectively comprising foundational economic and \npolitical attributes identified as influencing a wide range of domestic differences.  \n \nEconomic wealth \nWealth is likely to impact domestic actors\u2019 receptivity to transnational influences by \nincreasing domestic demand for many of the same issues addressed by CR standards. For \nmany economists, factors such as environmental quality, labor rights, and good governance \n 14\nare \u201cnormal goods\u201d (Fredriksson et al., 2007; Lederman, Loayza, and Soares, 2005). We \nwould therefore logically expect demand for corporate environmental and social \nresponsibility to rise with GDP per capita (p.c.). This demand could be specified in a \nnumber of different ways, but where civic stakeholders come to learn about a particular CR \nstandard widely adopted in other countries, it makes sense that it could well take the form \nof pressure to adopt a similar standard. Likewise, firms could respond to demands for CR \nthrough various initiatives, including company-specific codes. Yet where domestic \nmanagers have learnt about codes such as ISO14001 or the GC (e.g. through contact with \nbusiness travelers), or face other pressures to adopt (e.g. from lead buyers), they might be \nmore inclined to turn to one of these internationally-recognized standards.  \nMore important still, wealth is likely to operate via supply-side effects. Planning, \nimplementing and certifying ISO14001 is known to involve potentially significant \nfinancial, managerial and (sometimes) technological resources (Moon and deLeon, 2005). \nThe costs associated with integrating the GC\u2019s principles into business practice are \nsimilarly unlikely to be negligible. We therefore expect domestically-owned firms in less \nwealthy countries to be less responsive to transnational influences (Klooster, 2006; Perkins, \n2007). \n  \nDemocracy \nAccording to the literature, several features of democracies might be expected to support \nthe demand for, and supply of, goods provided by CR codes (Alok, Neil, and Carl, 2004; \nPayne, 1995). They include the freer flow of information which mean that individuals are \nlikely to be better informed about the nature, existence and solutions to social, political and \n 15\nenvironmental \u201cbads\u201d (Lederman, Loayza, and Soares, 2005). Another is greater freedom \nof expression, with people living in democratic polities better able to give voice to their \nconcerns, preferences and demands, together with the freedom to associate, assemble and \norganize. Citizens in democratic states also have the right to vote, directly or indirectly, \ncreating incentives for vote-seeking politicians to respond to public demands.  \n   Based on these observations, we surmise that contact with foreign adopters of \nstandards is more likely to spillover into higher domestic adoptions in democratic polities \nthan autocratic ones. For a start, preferences for progressive environmental, social and\/or \npolitical practices should be stronger in democracies, increasing domestic receptivity to \nmatching innovations. With greater awareness of corporate \u201cmisdeeds\u201d in areas such as \nenvironmental degradation, corruption and working conditions, and how these affect their \nwell-being, individuals are more likely to demand action to address these negatives. As \nwith wealth, where a country is more strongly linked to states with a high number of \nadopters of a particular standard (e.g. the GC) , this demand for CR is more likely to be \nspecified in terms of the same standard (i.e. the GC).  \nActors in democratic polities will also be better-placed to exercise demands for CR. \nHence, compared to the situation in autocratic polities, citizens are far more likely to be \nable to exert pressure on firms to address their environmental and social aspects, e.g. via \nlabor unions, environmental NGOs, etc. The threat or reality of such pressure will, in turn, \nraise the payoffs from adopting standards. A failure to respond to societal expectations \npotentially involves a number of negative consequences for firms. Anticipating these \nconsequences, managers may seek to pre-empt civic activism, implementing measures \n 16\nwhich address citizens\u2019 concerns, including voluntary CR codes about which they have \nknowledge. \n \nPrevious Work \nAlthough not strictly comparable with our particular approach, previous empirical work \nprovides a number of parallel insights. Several large-N quantitative studies have shown that \neconomies whose export partners have a comparatively high number of adopters of \nISO14001 also have a higher domestic number of certified firms (Albuquerque et al., 2007; \nPotoski and Prakash, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006, 2007). The influence of FDI is more \nambiguous. Prakash and Potoski (2006) find that inward FDI has a statistically insignificant \neffect on domestic ISO14001 counts, while Delmas and Montiel (2008) estimate a negative \nand statistically significant effect, although it is worth noting that both studies are based on \ngeographically aggregated measures of total FDI inflows, not on a spatial lag variable. \nIndeed, using a spatial lag operationalization in their estimations, Prakash and Potoski \n(2007) find that certification count density weighted by FDI inflows from these countries \nhas a positive and statistically significant influence on domestic ISO14001 certification \ncounts. However, their source for FDI data has many gaps, which renders the validity of the \nFDI-weighted spatial lag questionable.1 At least within the quantitative literature, the \ninfluence of business travel on the cross-national diffusion of CR standards remains \nunexplored.  \n Turning to our hypothesized contextual variables, the existing literature provides \nmixed support for the role of GDP p.c. in influencing the adoption of standards, although \nnone of these works has explored wealth as a conditioning variable. A number of large-N, \n                                                 \n1 We have overcome this problem by purchasing more complete FDI data from UNCTAD. \n 17\nquantitative studies show that GDP p.c. has a statistically discernable positive effect on the \nnumber of ISO14001 certifications (Neumayer and Perkins, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, \n2007), but others find that its influence is sensitive to the inclusion of other variables and \nchoice of statistical specification (Potoski and Prakash, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006). \nYet quantitative research generally suggests that wealthier economies demonstrate greater \npolicy commitment and\/or actual performance with regards to a number of issues \nunderlying ISO14001 and the GC, including: superior environmental commitment and \nseveral measures of environmental quality (but not all measures, nor across all income \nlevels) (Dasgupta et al., 2001); a lower incidence of child labor (Shelburne, 2001); better \ncore labor rights (Busse, 2004); and lower levels of corruption (Bohara, Mitchell, and \nMittendorff, 2004). \n Regarding polity, the existing literature provides very limited insights, at least to the \ndirect question as to whether democracies are more receptive to CR standards. In a \nbivariate correlation, Bennie et al. (2007) finds that Forbes Global 2000 companies \nheadquartered in full democracies are more likely to join the GC, but this result does not \nhold in their multivariate analysis. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no studies have previously \ninvestigated the influence of polity on the uptake of ISO14001, although previous work \ngenerally supports the idea that more democratic countries have a better record on many of \nthe issues addressed by CR standards: superior environmental commitment (Neumayer, \n2004) and (possibly) environmental quality (Farzin and Bond, 2005); a lower incidence of \nchild labor (Shelburne, 2001); better core labor standards (Neumayer and de Soysa, 2005); \nand lower levels of corruption (Bohara, Mitchell, and Mittendorff, 2004).  \n \n 18\nMethod \nDependent variables \nWe run two separate sets of regressions \u2013 one for each of the CR standards. For the \nISO14001 estimation, our dependent variable is the number of certified facilities at the \nnational level, normalized by country population size (with data from ISO 2007). Along \nsimilar lines, the dependent variable for the GC estimation is the domestic number of \n\u201cactive\u201d business participants, again normalized by population size (with data from UN \n2008b). The panels do not cover identical years. The ISO panel spans 1996-2000 and \ncovers up to 151 countries, while the equivalent GC panel covers 2001-2005 with up to 149 \ncountries. The reasoning behind our choice of different sample periods is that the standards \nwere released at different times. Moreover, as documented in the literature, the \ndeterminants of innovation diffusion may vary over different stages of diffusion (O\u2019Neill et \nal., 1998; Rogers, 1995; Rosenkopf and Abrahamson, 1999). For consistency, we purposely \nfocus on the early stages of diffusion for which data are available for both standards, and \nwhen transnational influences are likely to be most important. The panels cover a six-year \nperiod, of which we lose the first year due to the inclusion of the temporally LDV.2  \n \nMain explanatory variables \nAs noted above, all three transnational connectivity variables are measured as spatial lags, \nwhich comprise the weighted sum of the dependent variable in other countries. In our \nresearch design, the weights capture the level of linkages between one state and others via a \nparticular type of cross-border linkage, while the dependent variable of interest is the \n                                                 \n2 Although the temporal length of our panel is shorter than several other studies concerned with diffusion, it is \nwell-suited to the GMM estimator deployed here, which is designed for temporally short, but cross-\nsectionally wide panels. \n 19\ndensity of standards in these countries. The spatial lag works by linking the density of \nISO14001 certificates\/GC participants in different countries \u2013 effectively allowing a given \ndensity of adoptions in one country to \u201cspillover\u201d to another one \u2013 through a weighting \nmechanism represented by a connectivity matrix. Formally, the spatial lag model is defined \nas follows: \n...iktit ikt\nk\ny yw\u03c1 \u03b5= + +\u2211   . (1) \nThe spatial lag ikt kt\nk\nyw\u2211  consists of two elements, namely an N T\u22c5  matrix of the \ndependent variable in all other units k, multiplied with an N N T\u22c5 \u22c5  block-diagonal spatial \nweighting matrix ikt\u03c9 , which measures the relative connectivity between N number of units \ni and N number of units k in T number of time periods in the off-diagonal cells of the matrix \n(the diagonal of the matrix has values of zero as there i = k and units cannot spatially \ndepend on themselves). The spatial autoregression parameter \u03c1  gives the impact of the \nspatial lag on the dependent variable. \nWe analyze three distinct spatial lags, for which we use three different connectivity \nvariables constructed as follows: (i) trade, measured as exports from country i to countries \nk, with data from UN (2007); (ii) foreign direct investment, measured as inward FDI stock \nof countries k in country i, with data from UNCTAD (2008);3 and (iii) business travel, \nmeasured as foreign business travelers from countries k visiting country i, with data from \nUNWTO (2007). All weighting matrices are row-standardized, i.e. the entries of each row \nsum to unity, which in effect means that we use trade shares, FDI shares and business \ntraveler shares, rather than absolute levels of connectivity. Row-standardization of the \n                                                 \n3 We use stock rather than flow data since the latter are notoriously volatile and provide a misleading \nindication of transnational linkages. \n 20\nweighting matrices is typically undertaken to allow an easy interpretation of the estimated \nspatial lag coefficient as the degree of interdependence (Anselin, 2002).4\nTurning to domestic contextual attributes, GDP p.c. is measured using data from \nWorld Bank (2007). The inclusion of GDP p.c. means that we do not seek to include a \nnumber of other income-dependent variables which have been identified in previous work \ninto the cross-national diffusion of CR standards. These include the number of \nenvironmental treaties (Vastag, 2004), number of environmental NGOs (Neumayer and \nPerkins, 2004) and number of environmental law firms (Potoski and Prakash, 2004). We \ncapture democracy using Marshall et al.\u2019s (2006) widely-used polity2 indicator. Derived \nfrom expert judgments on aspects of institutionalized democracy and autocracy within a \ncountry, polity2 runs from -10 to 10, with -10 representing a totally authoritarian political \nsystem and 10 a full democracy. \n \nControl variables \nTwo sets of control variable are included in each of our estimations. The first is a \ntemporally lagged dependent variable (LDV), included to control for bandwagon effects \n(Rosenkopf and Abrahamson, 1999). Typically, these are explained by network-type \nexternalities whereby the payoffs from adopting a particular standard rise with the number \nof domestic adopters, e.g. as more firms adopt ISO14001, so does its value as a legitimate, \nwidely-accepted signal of environmental responsibility. Bandwagon dynamics may also \narise from expanded information about particular standards that flow from a larger user \nbase. The existence of these self-reinforcing dynamics at the domestic scale has been \n                                                 \n4 Row-standardization also makes substantive sense since our primary interest is in the identity of the major \ntrade, investment and business travel partners, and not the total exposure of countries to these influences. \n 21\ndemonstrated in previous large-N, quantitative studies (Corbett and Kirsch, 2001; Moon \nand deLeon, 2005; Perkins and Neumayer, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006, 2007),  \n We also specify controls to take account of the possibility that prior adoption of \nother voluntary standards might facilitate subsequent uptake. For our ISO14001 \nestimations, we include a control variable capturing the domestic density of ISO9000 \ncertificates. ISO9000, the quality management system standard released by the ISO in \n1987, shares many similarities with ISO14001. Indeed, prior experience of ISO9000 is \nlikely to lower the associated information and implementation costs of ISO14001, \nincreasing uptake of the latter. Most likely this explains previous large-N, quantitative \nresearch showing a positive correlation between domestic uptake of ISO9000 and \nISO14001 (Delmas and Montiel, 2008; Perkins and Neumayer, 2004). Following a similar \nlogic, we include ISO14001 \u2013 released five years earlier than the Compact \u2013 as a control \nvariable in our GC estimations. As outlined earlier, the two codes differ in several \nimportant areas, more so than is the case for the ISO standards. Yet prior experience of \nISO14001 might plausibly reduce firms\u2019 reluctance to implement other CR standards \n(Delmas and Montiel, 2008).  \nWe do not include any further controls in order to avoid over-fitting the empirical \nmodel. With a temporally LDV, country fixed effects, year-specific time dummies, spatial \nlags, two explanatory variables capturing fundamental aspects of the economic and political \ncontext, together with variables controlling for prior adoption of potentially complementary \nstandards, the empirical model is already stringently specified. Any further control variable \nis likely to be either highly correlated with one or the other of the existing variables, \n 22\ncreating multicollinearity problems, or largely uncorrelated with the existing variables, in \nwhich case its omission would not bias the estimations. \n \nChallenges of modeling cross-national diffusion \nThe advantage of using spatial lags in the present context \u2013 as opposed to geographically \naggregated measures of connectivity, e.g. total exports \u2013 is that they capture valuable \ngeographic information about the degree to which countries are exposed to adopters in \nspecific other countries. However, analysts run the risk of attributing the spread of similar \ninnovations across different countries to transnational interdependencies when, in fact, they \nare independent and driven by common contextual factors across countries (Simmons and \nElkins, 2004). We are keenly aware of this potential pitfall. And although we cannot rule \nout estimating spurious cross-national diffusion effects altogether, we nevertheless seek to \nminimize this risk in a number of ways.   \n First, we include country-specific fixed effects to control for unobserved country-\nspecific differences which might be correlated with our explanatory variables, including the \nspatial lags. Fixed effects take out the between or cross-national variation in adoption levels \nacross countries and estimates are exclusively based on the over-time variation in adoption \nwithin countries. They thus eliminate the effect of spatial clustering in adoption levels \narising from the presence of similar contextual attributes, such as similar socio-cultural \nfactors, political systems or economic status in countries (Pl\u00fcmper and Neumayer, 2010). \nSpatial clustering in changes in adoption may still create problems in the estimation \nof our spatial lag variables. However, we believe that our measures of transnational \ninterdependence (exports, FDI and business travel) are theoretically superior to rather \n 23\natheoretical measures of spatial clustering such as contiguity, geographical distance or same \nregion. Our measures actually specify a concrete diffusion mechanism via contact, \ncommunication and exchange, whereas these other measures of spatial clustering do not.  \nA second way in which we seek to minimize the risk of attributing spurious \ndiffusion is that we use year-specific fixed effects to control for common trends and shocks \nwhich affect all countries equally, e.g. growing worldwide awareness about a particular \nvoluntary standard over the period of our analysis. Third, we control for temporal dynamics \nby including the temporally LDV. A failure to control for common trends and shocks as \nwell as temporal dynamics is likely to lead to biased estimates and potentially erroneous \nconclusions regarding the influence of transnational interdependencies (Pl\u00fcmper and \nNeumayer, 2010).  \nThe estimation of our model is rendered difficult by the endogeneity of the spatial \nlags and by what is known as Nickell (1981) bias arising from the inclusion of the \ntemporally LDV. In order to deal with both problems, we estimate the model using \nArellano and Bond\u2019s (1991) dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. \nThis widely-used estimator for dynamic panel data models corrects for Nickell bias by \ninstrumenting the temporally LDV with further lags and also has the advantage that the \nspatial lag variables can be explicitly specified as endogenous, i.e. their past and \ncontemporaneous values are allowed to be correlated with the error terms, and they are \ninstrumented with further lags similar to the temporally LDV.  \n \n 24\nResults \nTable 1  provides results for ISO14001.5 Columns 1 to 3 show estimation results when each \nof the spatial lag variables are entered separately and without interaction effects, whereas \ncolumns 4 to 6 report results for each of the lags interacted with democracy and GDP p.c. \nConcentrating first on columns 1 to 3, the estimations confirm our a priori expectations in \nthat all of the spatial lag variables are statistically significantly positive. Thus, we find that \na higher density of ISO14001 adopters in other countries to which a particular state exports \ncomparatively more, from which it has a relatively larger stock of FDI, and from which \nmore business travelers visit spills-over into higher domestic densities of certificates. How \nimportant is each diffusion channel relative to the others? Unfortunately, because of the \nhigh level of collinearity amongst the spatial lag variables, they cannot be usefully entered \ntogether into the estimations. However, through our use of row-standardization, we can \nevaluate the relative strength of spatial dependence by comparing the estimated coefficients \nof the spatial lag variables. It seems that the degree of interdependencies through exports \nand business travel linkages are strongest, whereas interdependence through inward FDI \nlinkages is only half as strong. \nAs expected, the coefficient of the temporally LDV is positive and statistically \nsignificant, lending support to the idea that adoption is self-reinforcing.6 ISO9000 adoption \nhas a positive effect on ISO14001 uptake which, as per previous studies (Delmas and \nMontiel, 2008; Perkins and Neumayer, 2004), indicates that the two standards are \n                                                 \n5 The Arellano and Bond (1991) estimator depends on the assumption of no second order autocorrelation. The \nreported test results suggest that for all estimations we cannot reject this assumption at conventional levels of \nstatistical significance. \n6 Together, the sum of the coefficients of the temporal and spatial lags in columns 1 to 3 are implausibly high, \nrepresenting at face value a non-stationary process. Yet the coefficients of the temporal lags decrease \nsignificantly once the spatial lag variables are interacted. Also, estimating the models for a longer time period \n(up to 2005 in the case of ISO14001) leads to much lower coefficients for the temporal lags, which are no \nlonger implausibly high. \n 25\npotentially complements. As can be seen by their statistically insignificant coefficients, \nneither democracy nor GDP p.c. have an unconditional effect on domestic ISO14001 \ncertification density. \nYet, we do find that with the exception of business travel (for which the interaction \neffect is not far off statistical significance), all the interaction effects between the spatial lag \nvariables and GDP p.c. are statistically significantly positive (see columns 4-6). Spatial \ninterdependence through transnational linkages, in other words, is stronger in wealthier \neconomies. Interestingly, however, none of the interactions between the spatial lags and \ndemocracy are statistically significant. Note, with interacted variables, the coefficients of \nthe constituent terms on their own no longer have the same meaning as in non-interacted \nmodels. The insignificant coefficients of the spatial lag variables, which constitute one part \nof the interaction term, do not imply the absence of spatial dependence. Rather, they \nindicate the absence of spatial dependence only for observations in which GDP p.c. is equal \nto zero or extremely low. All that matters are the coefficients of the interaction effect which \nsuggest that as incomes grow the effect of spatial dependence becomes increasingly \npositive. \n We now examine our estimation results for the GC (table 2). Entered on their own, \nall of the spatial lag variables are significantly positive. Interdependence through export \nlinkages is strongest, almost three times as strong as the interdependence through other \nlinkages. The interaction effects are strikingly different compared to the estimations for \nISO14001. With one exception (business travel), GDP p.c. has no significant conditioning \nimpact on the spatial lag variables. However, whereas democracy was irrelevant for \nISO14001, it has a statistically significantly positive effect on the impact of all spatial lags \n 26\nfor the GC, implying that spatial interdependence through transnational linkages has a \ngreater influence in more democratic countries. Apart from the temporally LDV, none of \nthe other explanatory variables has a consistent effect on GC uptake. Unlike \nISO9000\/ISO14001, ISO14001 and the GC do not seem to be complementary. \n \nDiscussion and Conclusions \nWithin the context of economic globalization, heightened stakeholder expectations and a \nshift towards market environmentalism, global CR standards have emerged as increasingly \nimportant regulatory institutions governing aspects of corporate environmental and social \nresponsibility (Cashore, 2002; Hebb and W\u00f3jcik, 2005; Klooster, 2006; Neumayer and \nPerkins, 2004; Potoski and Prakash, 2004). Our goal in the present article has been to \nprovide fresh insight into how aspects of geography have underpinned spatio-temporal \nvariations in the early diffusion of two leading standards. Unique to the field of quantitative \nstudy, we integrate interdependencies working through transnational linkages and territorial \nspaces into explanations of (uneven) cross-national diffusion, modeling the latter as \nexerting a conditioning influence on the former. The statistical findings support our \narguments about the role of internal, contextual factors in shaping countries\u2019 receptivity to \nexternal, transnational influences. Yet, interestingly, we find a clear difference between the \ntwo standards in the domestic factors which exert a conditioning influence. In the case of \nISO14001, the strength of spatial interdependence through transnational linkages is greater \nin wealthier economies, but domestic levels of democracy appear to make no difference. \nPrecisely the opposite holds for the domestic uptake of the GC. The strength of spatial \ninterdependence through transnational linkages on domestic GC participation is higher in \n 27\nmore democratic countries while wealth only has a statistically discernable conditioning \neffect on interdependencies via business travelers. \nThese differences between ISO14001 and the GC are, on the face of it at least, \nsurprising. Yet it is quite possible that they reflect the very different nature of the respective \nstandards. The idea that democracy should be more likely to have a conditioning influence \non domestic receptivity to transnational forces in the case of the GC is therefore plausible. \nISO14001\u2019s close association with ISO9000, its emphasis on internal (\u201cwin-win\u201d) cost \nsavings, and potential differentiation advantage in terms of securing access to \nenvironmentally-demanding export markets, has meant that the standard has long held a \ndegree of commercial appeal for profit-seeking businesses. As evidenced by its lower \nuptake, however, the \u201cbusiness\u201d case for the GC has been far less obvious. In the absence \nof commercial benefits such as improved foreign market access, uptake of the Global \nCompact is likely to have been more dependent on pressure from domestic stakeholders. \nThis is likely to have increased the conditioning influence of democracy in that effective \ndemand from local stakeholders for the GC more strongly depends on the level of \ndemocratic freedoms. Indeed, whereas the GC addresses many issues (labor rights, human \nrights and corruption) which are characteristically suppressed in less democratic countries, \nthe managerial, environmental aspects addressed by ISO14001 are unlikely to prove \nespecially controversial to autocratic governments. These differences may also explain the \nparticular significance of wealth in conditioning spatial interdependence via transnational \nlinkages in the case of ISO14001. With levels of domestic demand less of a critical limiting \nfactor, as in the case of the GC, uptake of ISO14001 is more likely to have been \nconstrained by internal resources. Although firms in low-income countries may have \n 28\nanticipated payoffs from adopting ISO14001, limited domestic resources means they are \nunlikely to have been able to do so, with the result that diffusion is conditioned by domestic \nGDP p.c.7  \nAnother contribution of the present article was to re-examine and, moreover, extend \ncurrent understanding regarding the role of transnational linkages in diffusing CR standards \nacross national borders. Our findings for ISO14001 confirm several previous studies which \nsimilarly show a trading-up effect, but, furthermore demonstrate that the influence of export \nlinkages in increasing domestic certification is greater in wealthier countries (Albuquerque \net al., 2007; Neumayer and Perkins, 2004; Prakash and Potoski, 2006). Uniquely, and \nindicating that trading-up dynamics are not restricted to ISO14001, we also demonstrate \nthat if a country mainly exports to markets characterized by a high density of participants \nthis is associated with higher domestic participation in the GC. Our result for ISO14001 is \nfar from surprising: evidence reveals that a key motive for certification of this \u201cbusiness\u201d \nstandard has been anticipated or real demand from customers in major export markets \n(Bansal and Hunter, 2003; Kollman and Prakash, 2002; Wu, Chu, and Liu, 2007). \nHowever, there is little case-study evidence that similar supply-chain pressures are \nexercised by lead firms in relation to the GC, suggesting that the influence of exports may \nalso be through non-coercive dynamics such as expanded information. Regardless of the \nunderlying drivers, the fact that trade emerges as the most influential form of transboundary \nconnection-cum-flow lends strong support to arguments about the role of major exchange \npartners in fostering cross-border convergence (Clark et al., 2001; Prakash and Potoski, \n2006; Vogel, 1997).  \n                                                 \n7 It is also possible that the difference between ISO14001 and the GC may reflect differences in the sectoral \ndistribution of adopters of the respective standard although, in the absence of comparative data, we cannot say \nanything definitive on this point. \n 29\nInvesting-up dynamics are also apparent although, of note, the impact of spatial \ninterdependence through FDI on domestic uptake is estimated to be substantially lower than \nfor export linkages. Hence, consistent with work on FDI-related spillovers (Jordaan, 2008), \nwe find that if the main foreign countries with FDI stocks in the domestic country have a \nhigh density of ISO14001 certificates, this translates into higher domestic densities of \ncertification. This result confirms similar findings by Prakash and Potoski (2007), but \nadvances on this study by deriving from a larger sample and by being based on a more \ncomplete dataset of bilateral inward FDI stocks. We also provide evidence \u2013 for the first \ntime \u2013 of a similar investing-up effect in the case of the GC.  \nNovel to the quantitative literature, we additionally find evidence of \u201cvisiting-up\u201d \neffects. A higher density of ISO14001 certificates and GC participants in foreign countries \nwhose businesspeople visit is associated with higher domestic densities of the respective \nstandard in receiving countries. Of course, it is possible that our business travel \nconnectivity variable is simply capturing a broader set of influences related to trade and \nFDI. Still, our study provides the first large-N, statistical evidence supporting case-study \nliterature which has documented a role for business travel in diffusing new knowledge, \norganizational practices and norms across territorial boundaries (Beaverstock, 2002; Jones, \n2007).  \nWe finish by briefly discussing a couple of wider implications. First, our study\u2019s \nfindings highlight the need for diffusion researchers to rethink their approach to modeling \ncross-national diffusion. Although it might be heuristically useful to draw a distinction \nbetween internal and external determinants, our study suggests that it may not always make \nsense to treat them as functionally independent. Under certain conditions, the territorially-\n 30\nbounded, contextual attributes of place may be instrumental in amplifying or attenuating \nthe influence of transnational flows of information, norms and competitive pressures. \nAccordingly, we suggest that there is a need for researchers to explore integrating certain \ndomestic, contextual and transnational, relational aspects in their models of cross-national \ndiffusion. \nA second implication of our study is that it is wrong to assume that the cross-\nnational diffusion of different standards is governed by identical geographic factors. \nCertainly, the influence of boundary-spanning links is very similar in both cases, but our \nfindings also reveal differences in the role of domestic, contextual factors in influencing \ncountries\u2019 receptivity to transnational interdependencies. Different aspects of place, in other \nwords, appear to be important for standards with different goals, modalities and \nmechanisms.\n 31\nReferences \nAlbuquerque, P, B J Bronnenberg and C J
