Today, rapid tech-\nnological development means that knowledge is soon outdated and employees need to\nenhance their attractiveness through periodic self-development. In order to remain com-\npetitive employers need to update the skills of their workforce, as does the nation state. In\n30\nAn-J Volume 8 Number I\nrecent years many publications have argued the need to replace traditional patterns of edu-\ncation with the more flexible concept of Lifelong Learning (HMSO, 1998; DfEE, 1998a).\nLifelong learning means increasing numbers of individuals who need to access educational\nopportunities for irregular periods, fitting study around domestic and employment\ncommitments. This is also true of many full-time students who increasingly have to fit their\nstudies around paid work. Thus traditional modes of operation for HE, fixed attendance at\nlectures, limited opening hours for buildings, communication via notice boards, face-to-\nface meetings, seminars and tutorials all create barriers to ready access for people in such\nsituations. The challenge, therefore, is to find some way of maintaining traditional values\nwhile simultaneously responding to the call for increased (and different) participation, at\nlower cost.\nThe convergence of different media into a single networked digital domain, the rapidly\nexpanding accessibility of such media and dramatic reductions in cost, are tempting many\ninstitutions to develop an online presence. The Western Governors' University\n(www.wgu.edu), Colorado University's CU Online (www.cuonline.edu) and commercial\norganizations such as Phoenix University (www.uophx.edu\/online) and ZD University\n(www.zdu.com), with their potential to deliver globally, are indications of the possible\nshape of things to come. The Internet appears to offer learners the opportunity to study\nwhenever they like and wherever they have access to a terminal, not just via traditional on-\ncampus locations as dictated by the timetable. The addition of email, computer\nconferencing and video conferencing can assist this process by providing the discursive\nelement identified by Laurillard (1993) as crucial to the success of academic learning.\nThe De Montfort University Electronic Campus initiative aims to exploit the properties of\nonline technology to enhance the flexibility of access to learning opportunities and\nsupport for students on campus. This is an important distinction: rather than a move into\nthe arena of distance learning it is an attempt to exploit the properties of online\ntechnologies to enhance the quality of traditional provision through mixed mode delivery.\nIt is doing this by providing a substantial body of Web-based teaching, learning, and\nassessment materials, plus appropriate learning support systems. These encourage and\nfacilitate peer group interaction and staff-student exchanges, independent of time and\nspecific university location as far as possible but without losing the advantage of real staff-\nstudent contact and peer interaction characteristic of a traditional university (Brown,\n1998).\nDevelopment of the teaching and learning content\nThe Faculty of Art and Design has been actively involved in the development of Web-\nbased teaching and learning materials since 1995. With funding from the STILE (Student\nand Teachers Integrated Learning Environment) project, a CD-ROM and Web-support\nmaterials were developed for two lectures within a module (Zhao, Higgett and Cook, 1996).\nThis was followed by the development of a framework for an online learning environ-\nment for a complete module. This work was also supported by STILE and included\nlectures, search facilities, bulletin boards, text conferencing and tests\n(severn.dmu.ac.uk\/~nick\/STILE\/IDE\/main.HTM). Evaluation of this work showed that\nstudents performed equally as well (in some cases better) using the online environment,\n31\n5. Brown et at. Designs on the Web: a case study of online learning for design students\ncompared with those students attending the traditional lectures (Georgeadou and Higgett,\n1997; 1998).\nThe work reported in this paper sets out to build on this understanding of students' needs\nthrough the creation of an online learning resource for four first-year modules, which\nintroduce it to fashion designers, three-dimensional designers, design managers and\nmultimedia designers. These modules are taught over a twelve-week teaching semester and\nare run twice in an academic year. Class contact time per week includes a one-hour lecture\nand a two-hour practical session. This paper is primarily concerned with the development\nof the learning content and initial testing of this resource.\nStudent expectations of online learning: the initial study\nStudents' opinions on the use of Web-based teaching and learning materials were sought\nfrom the 1997-8 cohort who completed the Level 1 module using traditional teaching and\nlearning strategies. This was done using a questionnaire (see Appendix 1). Students were\nasked to rate how useful they thought it would be to have various teaching and learning\nmaterials online, such as lecture transcripts, practical notes and module handbooks. The\nrequirement for face-to-face contact was considered and students were asked if they would\nprefer to study online lectures independently as opposed to attending a traditional lecture\nseries. Finally students were asked if they had Internet access at their term- time address\nand if they would like to see their second-year Computer Aided Design (CAD) modules\nonline. One-hundred responses to the questionnaire were obtained, approximately 22 per\ncent of the 1997\u20148 cohort taking the four Level 1 IT modules. Of these respondents, a high\nproportion (20 per cent) had Internet access at their term-time address.\nThe expectation survey revealed that the majority of respondents were positively disposed\ntowards online resources. They thought that all the proposed aspects of an online learning\nresource would be useful to some degree (see Figure 1), and nearly all (91 per cent) were\nkeen to see second-year CAD modules online.\nso-\n70-\nH\n\u2022 50-\nm\n\u00abi\n30\n10\nj\n**\n>\n- I -\ns\n-4\nPractical Lertgrtf Pnchc^l note?

However,\nwhen asked if an online learning resource should be used to replace the traditional lecture,\nonly 18 per cent said they would be happy to study the lecture material independently using\nsolely the online resource. Over three-quarters of respondents (79 per cent) opted to keep\nthe face-to-face contact, with over half (55 per cent) saying that they would use the online\nresource as extra study material. This confirmed the earlier findings (Georgeadou and\nHiggett, 1997; 1998) and is in line with conventional wisdom that face-to-face lectures are\nbest. Nearly as many respondents (76 per cent) thought that access to online discussion\ngroups and previous student work would be useful. Online reading lists received the lowest\npercentage of votes although even here 65 per cent of respondents regarded them as being\nuseful.\nDeveloping the teaching and learning resource\nThe content for the courseware was split into distinct categories:\n\u2022 the handbook for each module;\n\u2022 a common set of lectures (text and images) for all four modules, to introduce the theory\nbehind the use of IT in design;\n\u2022 separate software tutorials to support the IT practicals for each module.\nThe more discursive elements of email, conferencing and online assessments were not\ntackled at this stage.\nThe module handbooks set the learning context, outlining the module aims, timetables,\nreading lists, expected learning outcomes, assessment methods and criteria for each\nmodule. These documents were already in Microsoft Word format and could be easily\nintegrated into the new Web-site. However lecture notes in most parts were in the form of\nhand-written notes. These had to be word-processed and edited with suitable illustrations\nand test questions so that they could act as a stand-alone learning resource. This required\nat least ten hours per lecture for the authors.\nThe following software tutorials, aimed at skills acquisition were developed:\n\u2022 Adobe Photoshop for the fashion and textiles module;\n\u2022 3D studio for the three-dimensional design module;\n\u2022 Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia Director for the multimedia design module;\n\u2022 Quark Xpress for the design management module.\nInitially it was intended to create animated software tutorials with voice-overs using Lotus\nScreen Cam. However, after experimentation it was decided that the size of these files (as\nmuch as four or five Mbytes per minute) was too great given the present speed of the\nnetwork. Thus the tutorials were developed using text and still screen shots, each two-hour\ntutorial taking 25-30 hours to produce.\nAH this material was then given to an external Web design company for authoring into the\nfinal application. To maximize the use of available funds, a low-cost start-up company of\nDe Montfort University graduates was used.\n33\nS. Brown etat. Designs on the Web: a case study of online learning for design students\nSeveral problems were encountered during the development stage. The main problem was\nshortage of staff time to provide the content. Even though funding was available it was\nimpossible in most cases to release full-time teaching staff to develop the lecture content. This\nwas mainly due to the difficulty in finding suitable part-time staff to take over existing teach-\ning commitments and meant full-time staff involved in the project had extra work added to\nan already heavy workload. The available funding was used mainly for the development of\ntutorials for the practical classes, which were normally delivered by part-time staff.\nThe large number of authors involved in the project, four full-time and five part-time\nmembers of staff, led to a further problem in co-ordinating a large number of inputs. This\ncombined with the heavy workload on authors meant that content was not always handed\nover on schedule for production. This was compounded by the fact that the external\nproduction company was a start-up operation and was unable to provide a consistent\nuninterrupted service. This resulted in materials being available online sometimes only\nhours before they were needed and meant that there was no time to evaluate and refine the\nmaterials before usage. It was felt that these problems with team working could have been\novercome by more in-house Web development support or Web development training for\nstaff on the development side.\nResults from the first year of use\nThe effects of using the Web-based teaching and learning materials were assessed by can-\nvassing student opinion and analysing student performance.\nStudent opinion\nFollowing completion of the modules by the first cohort (1998-9), a feedback question-\nnaire was administered to ascertain students' opinions of the online learning materials at\nthe end of each teaching semester (see Appendix 2). The survey aimed to ascertain how use-\nful the new site had been, and how useful a number of proposed additional features would\nbe. Students were also asked where they gained access to the site and if, after seeing the\nonline materials for Level 1, they would like to see their Level 2 CAD module online. A\ntotal of 248 questionnaires were completed, approximately 54 per cent of the total number\nof students taking the Level 1 IT modules.\nThe feedback questionnaire revealed that most respondents (82 per cent) used the online\nresource as part of their study, with the same percentage keen to see a second-year CAD\nmodule online. Comparing use between design disciplines, 92 per cent of those studying\nthree-dimensional design used the resource, whereas the other disciplines of design\nmanagement, fashion and textiles and multimedia design had lower utilization percent-\nages; these were 83,19 and 75 per cent respectively. Many reasons could be attributed to\nthe differences across disciplines. Lack of networking in the laboratories used by design\nmanagement and fashion and textiles students is likely to have contributed to their lower\nuse of the resource.\nDespite the surprisingly high level of Internet access at home, most respondents used\nuniversity resources to access the site either in the CAD laboratory (39 per cent) or in the\nKimberlin Library (37 per cent). Smaller percentages used their own (9 per cent) or a\nfriend's computer (15 per cent).\n34\nAa-J Volume 8 Number I\nConsidering the responses of students from all design disciplines it can be seen that the\nrank ordering of different elements was identical to the results of the expectation survey.\nIn practice, the lecture transcripts were seen to be the most useful aspect of the existing\nonline resource (85 per cent), followed by the practical notes (70 per cent), handbooks (52\nper cent) and finally the reading lists (49 per cent).\nPotential additional features were also rated. The most useful additions were considered to\nbe further practical examples (86 per cent), a gallery of previous student work (85 per cent)\nand a sample test (85 per cent). Online discussion facilities scored the lowest number of\nstudents' votes in the useful or very useful categories (60 per cent).\nThe IT for fashion and textiles module is run at the Leicester City campus and at a\nfranchise college. However, because of the large discrepancy in student numbers studying\nthe module at the two sites (140 at Leicester and 8 at the franchise college) it was felt\nunwise to compare the results from the feedback questionnaire. However the results do\nshow that the majority of students, irrespective of location, have used Web-based learning\nmaterials and viewed the features of the current site useful.\nStudent performance\nA statistical analysis was performed to assess if there was any significant difference in\nmarks attained by a cohort studying the module with access to Web-based learning mate-\nrials and the cohort studying the modules using traditional learning strategies. Average\nmark comparisons were made between the design disciplines in the 1997-8 cohort and the\n1998-9 cohort.\nThe null hypothesis that the student marks came from the same population was asserted.\nStudent's t test for the equality of means was performed using SPSS. The average mark for\neach design discipline and the two tailed significance of the difference in means are given in\nTable 1.\nStudent group\nFashion and Textiles\nThree Dimensional Design\nMultimedia Design\nDesign Management\nAverage mark, 1997-8\n50.9\n58.5\n57.1\n552\nAverage mark, 1998-9\n54.8\n54.2\n61.2\n52.3\nSignificance\n0.004\n0.025\n0.036\n0.101\nTable I Comparison of average marks between cohort 1997-8 and cohort 1998-9\nIt can be seen that at a significance level, p=0.01 there is no significant change in results for\nthe groups between years except for fashion and textiles. This group shows a significant\nincrease in performance of 4 per cent. Thus for most disciplines it appears that student per-\nformance is similar before and after the introduction of Web-based learning materials.\nDiscussion\nThe analysis of the expectation and feedback questionnaires indicated that design students\ntaking IT modules were positively disposed towards online learning resources. While this\nview is hardly surprising given the nature of the topic itself, it is in contrast to the view held\n35\nS. Brown et al. Designs on the Web: a case study of online learning for design students\nby some staff that students require extrinsic motivation to use new technologies (Littlejohn\nand Stefani, 1999). The site provides students with an assurance that they have access to all\nthe notes accompanying the module and so if some part of the traditional teaching is\nmissed, the notes are easy to access. The teaching and learning content developed for the\nsite is also of use as a source of reference to other undergraduate and postgraduate stu-\ndents within the Faculty of Art and Design.\nIt was clear from the expectation survey that students do not wish face-to-face lectures to\nbe replaced by online resources. In addition, the results from the feedback questionnaire\nrevealed that the inclusion of online discussion facilities were not considered as useful as\nother features such as further practical examples and samples of past work. This is\ninteresting given the importance often attached to staff-student and peer group discussion\n(Laurillard, 1993) and may be because students at present have little or no experience of\nusing online discussion and plenty of opportunities for face-to-face discussions on campus.\nThe attitude of students towards the need for the traditional lecture may change given\nexposure to a development complete with discursive elements.\nThe majority of students used campus-based university computing facilities to access the\nresource, despite high expectation of home use. This may be due to students' concerns over\nthe cost of modem access to the Internet. This is one aspect of a wider issue revealed by\nBacsich, Ash, Boniwell and Kaplan (1999), namely the ways in which online learning\ntransfers costs to students (and staff) and it seems likely to dominate student access\npatterns until fixed cost or truly free access to the Internet becomes available. This\nbehaviour appears to confirm and reinforce De Montfort's policy decision not to establish\nthe Electronic Campus as a 'virtual university'.\nThe statistical analysis of average marks for each module before and after the introduction\nof the online resource showed student performance remained similar over the two years. In\nfact one discipline, fashion and textiles, showed a significant improvement in marks. This is\nencouraging although it is not possible to attribute these results solely to the provision of\nonline learning materials as there are many other variables involved such as differences in\nequipment provision, student ability, changes in teaching provision and lack of networking\nin some parts of the laboratory.\nTeaching staff were generally positive towards the use of online learning, and identified the\nfollowing key benefits:\n\u2022 Prepared lecture and practical notes online reduced the amount of pre-class\npreparation time required by established staff.\n\u2022 New members of staff teaching on the modules had easy access to all the notes, this\nsaved preparation time and gives a good indication of the range and standard of the\nmaterial to be delivered.\n\u2022 A common set of readily available notes enabled consistent delivery of material across\nthe four modules in both teaching semesters. This was particularly true for staff\nteaching at the franchise college, enabling a comparable learning experience for\nstudents at both sites.\n\u2022 The time needed for organizational tasks such as submitting notes for photocopying,\nfiling and distributing handouts has been dramatically reduced.\n36\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nStaff identified some disadvantages: the preparation time for the development of stand-\nalone learning materials was high and a heavy burden. Preparation-time to study-time\nratios for the lecture material was typically 10:1 while the practical tutorials the ratio was\nas high as 15:1. The dynamic nature of IT means that lecture and practical material needs\nto be updated on a regular basis and so the online learning resource will need to be edited\nfrequently.\nThe WebCT (World Wide Web Course Tools) courseware-authoring tool developed at the\nUniversity of British Columbia (Goldberg and Salari, 1997) has been adopted by the\nUniversity's Electronic Campus initiative as its main design environment. This provides the\ncourseware developer with communication, search and testing facilities. The existing\ncontent has imported into WebCT and is currently being piloted.\nConclusions\nThe study has some important implications from the perspective of the students. Design\nstudents view Web-based learning positively and do not need extrinsic motivation to utilize\nthe technology. Student performance seems to be the same before and after the introduc-\ntion of Web-based materials. The quality of the student learning experience is more con-\nsistent between sites and semesters, and material is more readily available to all students\nstudying the modules, including franchise students, when it is on the Web. Students are\nmore likely to access online resources within the university.\nFrom a development perspective there are some lessons to be learnt. Online resources have\nhigh front-loaded development costs but, once generated, can result in a reduction of time\nneeded to plan and organize course materials. However, releasing staff to work on\ndevelopment is not a simple matter of buying out time; there may be reasons why it is not\npossible to release key teaching staff. Large, multi-author projects introduce similar risks in\nmeeting delivery and quality targets. These risks are exacerbated by the use of a low-cost\nexternal production company which introduces an element of risk in terms of the\nlikelihood of meeting delivery and quality targets. The combination of a large multi-\nauthor project with a low-cost production company is unlikely to result in course materials\nmeeting cost, time and quality requirements.\nReferences\nBacsich, P., Ash, C., Boniwell, K., Kaplan, L.
