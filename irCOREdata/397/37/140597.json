The paper provides evidence of changing relationships in\ncommercial aerospace supply chains.\nIntroduction\nIn response to fiercer competition in the global marketplace, there has been a\ncall for innovative solutions in terms of products, technologies and practices at the\nsame time as reducing lead-time and costs (Rose-Anderssen et al., 2005; Goffin et al.,\n2006). The obvious approach to reduce lead time and costs has been to adopt the\nlean practices of the automotive industries. The key principles of lean practices are\nopen dependencies between business partners, just-in-time deliveries and no\nwastage of resources and materials (Womack et al., 1990). Creating innovative\nsolutions, however, requires going beyond the improvement of adopting practices\nused within other industries and by competitors. Competitive advantage can be\nenhanced through introducing radically new products into the market. Veryzer (1998)\nrefers to these new products as discontinuous innovations, where the products\nhave been designed beyond customers\u2019 imagination. In that sense creative\nperformance and innovation can be positively influenced by what Kratzer et al.\n(2006) refer to as team polarity. Team polarity is defined as the difference in opinions\nand perspectives among members of innovative teams. In this paper, Kratzer et al.\u2019s\npolarity is referred to as diversity.\nThe case study presented has its focus on the global competition in the market\nfor large commercial aircraft. Risk-sharing partnerships are used as instruments for\nenhancing innovation and competitive advantage for a new aircraft model; the tenet\nbeing that risk-sharing partnerships allows for exploratory processes and financial\nstrength that go beyond the limited creative capacity of a firm working alone. The\npaper then presents supply chains as evolutionary networks of multiple work\nactivities. These work activities are discussed in terms of the evolutionary\ntransformation of relationships at boundaries. Within this discussion a model of\nthe instrumentality of relationships as complex evolutionary processes is\nintroduced. Following this, a method of data collection is proposed and justified. The\ncase is then discussed within the framework of the model in the specific context of\none airframe manufacturer and its suppliers.\nA combination of an activity theoretical approach and complex systems thinking\nis applied for analysing these processes of change. Work activities are characterized\nby the multi-voiced interaction created within them, and their potential for expansive\ntransformation (Engestr\u00f6m, 2001). In this communicative interaction, the diversity of\nopinions and perspectives create contradictions that play a central role as sources of\nchange and development. Contradictions are historically accumulated tensions within\nand between activity networks (Engestr\u00f6m, 2001). In these activities there are\ncontinuous processes for creation of new instruments for change (Engestr\u00f6m,\n1987).\nRisk-Sharing Partnerships as Instruments for Innovation\nA supply chain can be defined as the integration of the flow of information and\nmaterials between customers, manufacturers and suppliers (Samaranayake, 2005).\nThere are different aerospace supply chain forms. These are characterized by changing\npractices in the evolutionary adaptation to market realities and to proactive responses to\nincreased competition (Rose-Anderssen et al., 2009). The adaptation can be\nexemplified in lean practices, where complex networks of suppliers and customers are\nclosely integrated into long-term relationships for reducing costs and ensuring high\nquality (Cagliano et al., 2004). Risk-sharing partnerships, on the other hand, are\nproactive responses to increased competition.\nTraditionally airframe manufacturers handled most of the risk associated with\ninnovation, development and production (Williams et al., 2002). Risk-sharing\npartnerships, however, spread this risk at the same time as influence and revenue\nis shared between the partners. Risk-sharing partnerships used as instruments for\nenhancing creative capacity is based on the intention of integrating a diverse division\nof labour and expertise held by each partner company. It is the synergetic effects\ncaused by collaboration on diversity of perspectives through constructive dialogue\nwhile creating a shared voice and vision (John-Steiner, 2000) that is sought when\nbringing firms into collective partnerships. From the point of division of expertise,\nGem\u00fcnden et al. (2007) have studied the roles of innovators in highly innovative\nventures. In this so-called German approach, four types of promoters of innovation are\nidentified. First, there is the power promoter who has the necessary hierarchical power\nto drive a project. Second, there is the expert promoter who has the specific technical\nknowledge for the innovation process. Third, the process promoter has the expertise\nof organizational know-how and network building. Fourth, the relationship promoter has\nthe strong personal ties outside the organization. Although this paper is not about\nindividuals in the single firm, our findings regarding individual firms engaged in\nradical innovations in aircraft production fit the role models of the German\napproach (Table 1). As will be seen in this paper, the instruments used in\nthese roles are important for large-scale commercial aircraft innovation.\nPritchard and MacPherson (2004, 2007) are concerned about the substantial\ntechnology transfer from the prime contractor to globally- located risk-sharing partners\nand the loss of jobs among skilled workers and designers in the Western\ncommercial aircraft sector.\nTable 1.

Complex global networks of one airframe manufacturer and its suppliers are\nformed to reduce financial, technological and market access barriers (Esposito,\n2004). The reality shift from the traditional local subcontractor base is also enforced\nby the fact that there is a growth demand in the key emerging markets (Lefebvre &\nLefebvre, 1998).\nChanging the form of relationship from one type to another is not only a matter of\nchoice but also a matter of capacity to do so. The realistic point of departure here is\nto assess the reality of power regimes within the supply network and adapt and work\naccording to these (Cox, 2004). The lack of general appropriateness of supplier\ndevelopment models and supply chain managed models is that they both become\neffective in situations of buyer dominance and interdependence only. Risk-sharing\npartnerships emphasize the importance of the latter. In this regime of relationships,\ntechnological innovation depends particularly on the co-ordination and integration\nactivities ensuring durable relationships between customers and suppliers (Lefebvre &\nLefebvre, 1998).\nActivity Networks and Boundary Crossing\nAerospace supply chains are complex systems of power relationships. Complex\nsystems thinking, pioneered in the natural sciences by I. Prigogine and his colleagues\nin the 1970s, is attaining increasing recognition for understanding change, adaptation\nand evolutionary processes within social and industrial settings. Cultural-historical\nActivity Theory was founded by L. Vygotsky, A.N. Leont\u2019ev and A.R. Luria in Soviet-\nRussia in the 1920\u20131930s. This theory is a philosophical framework for studying\ndifferent forms of human work practices and their transformation.\nThe theoretical concepts in this section will be applied to the evolutionary framework\nof Figure 1.\nFigure 1. Instrumentality of Relationships as Complex Evolutionary Processes\nA work activity is a complex network of individuals and their human artefacts (Rose-\nAnderssen & Allen, 2008). As such it is a developmental process connecting the\nindividual and the social levels through their human artefacts and their object\norientation. In these complex networks the physical reality is governed by the complex\nset of invisible effects of individuals interacting by using a diversity of opinions and\nexperiences (Rose-Anderssen et al., 2005). The network as a whole may therefore\npotentially adapt and respond to the environment in multiple and unpredictable ways\n(Allen, 2001a). It is the excess diversity that fuels adaptation, exploration and\nchange. Innovation is therefore restricted when diversity is reduced and\nstandardization is increased (McCarthy, 2004). As an activity is already a network, the\nsupply chain becomes a complex network of multiple work activities. Here individuals\ninteract within and across boundaries between companies. The human artefacts are\nsimilarly used within and across company boundaries.\nThe Evolution of a Work Activity and the Significance of History\nThe elements of the activity are represented by the individual subjects of consideration,\ntheir activity community, the object and the mediating human artefacts. There are three\nmediating artefacts. The instruments mediate between the individual and the object.\nThe social rules mediate between the individual and the activity community. And the\ndivision of labour and expertise mediates between the community and the object. It is\nimportant to make a distinction between object and objectives. Objectives are rigidly\nindependent of individual conceptions, personal bias, thoughts and feelings. An object,\nhowever, is the emerging vision that integrates the elements of the activity\n(Figure 2).\nQualitative change can occur when there are disturbances between the elements. That\nis, change occurs at moments of instability when some new aspects or elements grow\nin the system, restructure it, and invade new dimensions. Thus new properties of the\nelements continually emerge (Rose-Anderssen et al., 2005), making the outcome\nunpredictable in detail. The emerging changes to supply chains beyond individual\nhuman control must therefore always be of concern through collective efforts. Under\nthese dynamic circumstances, the relationships between the elements are therefore\nin continual processes of modification. And they take multiple and diverse forms within\nthe time of the activity (Foucault, 1972). In other words, as people try to change\nand develop an activity, they are themselves changed by their adaptation to these\nchanges.\nThe object is central for integrating individual action into a collective activity. The\npoint of departure is the identification of a problem or an opportunity. In the\ncase and results section, the airframe manufacturer identifies a potential opportunity\nto gain a competitive advantage through closer integration of key suppliers. This is the\ninitiation of an object formation process with the basis in risk- sharing partnerships.\nIdentification of new potential opportunities\nInstruments for initializing new relationships\nInstruments for developing\nclose relationships\nInstruments for sustaining\nclose relationships\nRisk sharing partnerships\nFigure 2.

First, it functions as an object and then it\nmay function as an instrument (Foot, 2002). This paper explores the instruments\nused for the object of developing relationships in supply chains. Simultaneously the\ndeveloping relationships are used for enhancing innovation.\nKnowledge and Routines versus Expansive Learning\nMiettinen and Virkunnen (2005) argue that notions of routine and rule-governed\naction do not explain the emergence of new practices. Traditionally, routines have\nbeen conceptualized as carriers of regular and predictable practices. From that\nperspective routines are seen as carriers of an organization\u2019s skills and knowledge. In\nsupply chains this becomes more difficult as the chain is a meeting place of several\ncompanies\u2019 different routines.\nGoing beyond the limitations of routines in a rapidly changing environment,\ncommunities with the ability to learn will prevail over communities with optimal, but\nfixed behaviour (Allen, 2001b). In that sense Blackler (1995) argues that the notion\nof knowledge should rather be seen as a dynamic process of social construction, the\nknowing in doing. That is, at moments of instability, during which knowledge is\ntransformed, qualitative and structural change can be created (Rose-Anderssen et al.,\n2005). In other words, it is the transformation of knowledge in order to adapt the\nsupply chain to the future that is interesting. This means releasing the creative\ncapacity within the supply chain into these unstable situations. Here, individuals start\nquestioning present practices and suggest new models of practice. When these\nchallenged models descend to the practical level of implementation, and are tested\nout in practice, this collective movement has become an expansive learning process\n(Engestr\u00f6m, 1987). These expansive learning processes, Engestr\u00f6m argues,\nshould be viewed as partially destructive rejection of old perspectives and practices. As\ncollective practices, collaboration between firms on developing radically new\nproducts also becomes practice in developing close relationships. The learning in doing\ntherefore transforms both knowledge and relationships.\nDilemma Situations and Boundaries\nDilemma situations occur at boundaries (Kerosuo & Engestr\u00f6m, 2003). A\nboundary is crossed as an individual tries out new instruments in interaction with\nanother individual in order to inquire or negotiate a common object for creation of\nalternative practices. At the social level essential dilemmas cannot be resolved\nthrough individual actions alone. Here it is the collective creation of new instruments\nthat resolves the dilemma. In that sense, evolving inner contradictions are the chief\nsources of movement and change in the activity network. For the supply chain\nas such the inner contradictions are, as Kratzer et al. (2006) argue, the potential\nfor creative performance.\nIn supply chains, boundaries are therefore experienced when old practices do not\nwork. This may occur when involving suppliers from low cost economy (LCE) countries\nor when trying to search for more innovative solutions.\nDeveloping close relationships are collective processes. These processes are\ncharacterized by dismantling those old routines that would inhibit relationships\nacross company boundaries. The instrument risk-sharing partnerships can be used as a\ncrowbar for negotiating how to collectively proceed. And that is a continuous dialogical\nprocess of questioning present practices and how to change these.\nPower, Distance, Trust and Relationships\nPower differences create boundaries. In that sense traditional supply chain forms of\nbuyer dominance create boundaries. Power is really shifting from action to action\n(Engestr\u00f6m, 2000), and it is therefore shifting from actor to actor (Foucault, 1980;\nGiddens, 1982). Therefore the ability of any individual to construct reality is\ncompletely dependent on their place in the activity process, mediated by the division\nof labour (Engestr\u00f6m, 2000).\nPower and distance issues are a challenge to master in human relationships. Scollon\nand Scollon (1983) argue that the way we speak or the way our discourse systems\nwork are governed by both the way individuals or groups value or assume a\nrelationship when an imposition is put upon them in terms of power relationships,\nand the distance between self and the other (in terms of closeness of relationship). In\nthat respect, meaningful interactive relationships between people are facilitated by\ntrust as it produces mutual expectations (Bachmann, 2003). Mutual expectations are\ndeveloped through the object formation process. Trust is associated with the risk\nof things going wrong (Nooteboom & Six, 2003). However, as people interact and share\nexperiences, they may learn about their potential partner\u2019s needs, which may\nchange their assumptions, and may eventually create a mutual platform of trust\n(Rose-Anderssen & Allen, 2008). Due to the issue of risk, people may also substitute\ntrust with control. Control as a trust substitute is characterized by formal, contractual\ncontrol with an imposition of procedures for monitoring (Nooteboom, 2003). As a\nsubstitute for control, rational trust would be based on evidence of the partner\u2019s\ncompetence and intentions to conform.\nIn practice, rational trust becomes the criteria used for supplier selection.\nHowever, sustaining close relationships is a continuous effort of nurturing mutual\nexpectations.\nThe Dynamic Connection between Multiple Work Activities\nSupply chains as evolutionary networks of multiple work activities can be presented in\nits simplest form as the interaction between two companies in Figure 3 (see\nEngestr\u00f6m, 2001). Dilemma situations are experienced at boundaries between firms.\nThe object formation process in the diffuse boundary zone between Company A and\nCompany B in Figure 3 is as follows. First, Objects A and B are the objects\nCompany A and Company B respectively start off forming within each company. These\nare the visions or purposes each company is collectively developing for their role in the\nsupply chain. Secondly, Objects A2 and B2 are the emerging objects the companies\nbring into the boundary zone of collaboration between them. Object C, therefore, is\nCompany A\u2019s and Company B\u2019s collaborative understanding of their collective work\nactivity. The difference between A2 and B2 makes the boundary zone, Object C,\nemerge.\nThe risk-sharing partnership can be characterized by a continuous object formation\nprocess in sometimes multiple and diffuse boundary zones. In this context, as\nLektorsky (1984) argues, the object becomes clearer as people co-explore this\nboundary zone.\nIn the case results and discussion section, the evolutionary transformations of\nrelationships in boundary zones are explored within the framework of Figure 1.\nMethod of Data Collection\nThis paper is a part outcome of a three-year research project on the evolution of\ncommercial aerospace supply chains. Data was collected in two steps: a literature\nresearch and interviews. The research started off by conducting a literature\nresearch on: supply chains in general; on aerospace supply chains specifically;\nhistorical accounts of aircraft production; literature on evolution, learning,\nknowledge and change; and data from company internet sources. The treatment of\ndata involved systematic coding of categories identified in the texts. It meant a\nprocess of continuous comparison and recoding of categories. The data was used to\ncreate an evolutionary classification scheme of commercial aerospace supply chains. It\nconcluded the first phase of the project.\nThe second phase of the project was con\nplayers of one specific supply chain regarding the\nsupply chains.

Our experience, however, is that our interviews of focus groups became close\nconversations between the interviewees. This peer interaction helped expand on the\nissues to be explored. The interviewees collaborated in an activity where the object\nwas to explore and make sense of specific issues. Therefore due to the\ninterviewees\u2019 complementary insights, the synergies produced were an expansion of\nwhat the individuals could have produced alone. The atmosphere also became\nmore relaxed than in the individual interviews where the individual would be under\nconstant pressure to perform.\nCase Results and Discussions\nIn the following sections, a developmental process of changing supply chain\nrelationships is presented. The success of one supply chain form of highly\ncollaborative relationships between airframe manufacturer, airlines and first-tier\nsuppliers for one aircraft model is developed into risk-sharing partnerships for a new\naircraft model.\nThe Instrumentality of Relationships in Aerospace Supply Chains\nIdentification of Competitive Advantage \u2013 Relationship Promotion\nWhen the airframe manufacturer was losing market share, an initial dilemma\noccurred. They chose to involve more strongly the needs of airlines. This was the point\nof departure of the collaborative supply chain form.\nA decade ago really, probably, [we] felt like it applied more to working together\nwith our airline customers as a stronger connection. In driving the product\ndesign the airlines were embodied in the model [xxx] plane, which has got a\nhuge part of the market compared to the competition. (Airframe manufacturer,\ninterviewee 1)\nBringing the customer into the activity of aircraft design increased the diversity of\nperspectives influencing an object for user-friendly aircraft design. The positive\nexperience with close relationships to airlines also encouraged close relationships to be\ndeveloped with suppliers. These relationships were used as instruments for bringing\ntogether latent expertise for producing more customer desirable aircraft.\nAnd I think we have learned, we have been learning that aspect of collaboration\napplies in more than just as [with] the customer. So we have been moving in a\ndirection to be more collaborative with our partners. Sharing more, earlier,\ninvolving them earlier and more deeply in our design. So that collectively we\ncan achieve something better than the old producer system. (Airframe\nmanufacturer, Interviewee 1)\nThe identification of a relationship form that potentially could facilitate innovation\nand competitive advantage was the point of departure of forming a new object\n(Object A in Figure 3). Expanding on imagining the future happened through the\nentrepreneurial step where the airframe manufacturer brought selected suppliers into\nthe boundary zone for developing a shared object (Object C in Figure 3)\nInstruments for Initializing New Relationships \u2013 Power and Expert Promotion\nThe aircraft manufacturer was the company that had to face the airlines in the\nmarket directly. Thus their interpretation of market demand was essential for the\nsuccess of the supply chain as a whole. And in that sense, the airframe manufacturer\nas a major customer of the suppliers was in a position of power to impose a\nreflection of the airlines\u2019 demand. Although the supply chain hierarchy had not changed\nat the initialization stage, a mutual need situation had been created. It was in the\ninterests of both the airframe manufacturer and the suppliers to sustain their\npresence in the market.\nBringing the airlines and its suppliers into an object formation process of user-\nfriendly design and adopting the practices used by competitors, gave the airframe\nmanufacturer competitive ability with the plane xxx. But it did not give them\ncompetitive advantage as they had only made marginal improvements to existing\nairplane concepts. In other words, they were listening to market needs but they did\nnot create and present something radically new to the market.\nI think that was taking an existing plane and making point solutions. It was taking\nlow risk and a conservative approach. We made improvements with the cockpit, the\nnavigation system, the seating and storage. They were what I call point solutions\nintegrated. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 2)\nA more proactive response to the fiercer global competition was made when the\nairframe manufacturer considered a relationship form that could give them competitive\nadvantage. Therefore to be able to move beyond the marginal improvements based on\nthe imagination of the customer (Veryzer, 1998), they needed to cross boundaries\ninto the unknown. This meant moving totally away from old concepts of aircraft design.\nThe airframe manufacturer realized that this could not be resolved through their own\nactions alone (Kerosuo & Engestr\u00f6m, 2003). Risk-sharing partnership was the\nrelationship form that could connect the diverse capacity needed for radical change.\nThe selection criteria were based on rational trust. This was built on long-term\nrelationships, and upfront issues of financial and technological capabilities.\nYou almost have a different requirement of a supplier upfront capabilities. But\nthose capabilities now quickly move into a sustaining load. They are a very\ndifferent set of capabilities. The upfront capabilities\nare characterized by financial and technological capacities. (Airframe manufacturer,\ninterviewee 3)\nChanging well-established relationships meant divorcing old routines and practices.\nThe airframe manufacturer was in power to do so. Therefore change could be initiated\nby the airframe manufacturer withdrawing existing items such as long-term contracts\nand replacing them with new risk-sharing contracts.\nAnd if you look at the main contracts, for example, for the [new airplane], they\nhave called back the terms we have with them, pretty much straight through. And it\nis a partnership you know. They have become really a part of our business in the way\ntheir contract reflects. There is risk associated with that obviously. (European\nmechanical systems supplier, interviewee 1)\nThe power of expertise gave the selected supplier an advantage towards the\nairframe manufacturer. This contractual interdependency between the airframe\nmanufacturer and supplier empowered the supplier as long as he complied with\nthe contract. However, once contracts had been signed, the power of national airlines\nto demand use of suppliers from their own country was part of that complex\nsystem. This power exercise was balanced through the airframe manufacturer and risk-\nsharing partners\u2019 choice of suppliers in these countries to promote sales of planes and\nsecure local maintenance for the aftermarket of equipment and systems. Thus the\nsupply chain became a complex system of power relationships (Engestr\u00f6m, 2000).\nWe essentially take into account market access. We take into account access to\ncapital market, access to technology. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 3)\nWe also approached one country to develop engineering skills because we know\nthat when we introduce commercial aircraft into a commercial market, those airlines\nwould need engineers help them maintain those airplanes. We have network\nrelationships and an infrastructure that supports those sales. (Airframe\nmanufacturer, interviewee, 2)\nWe have global relationships with suppliers of the new aircraft model and these\nare different. These are actually risk-sharing partners. We ask them to take on the\ndesign, the certification and the fully integrated work for key elements of that\naeroplane. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 4)\nWe need other companies to be risk-sharing partners that could be financially, but\nalso be from a sales standpoint. So it also mitigates our risk investing billions of\ndollars on our own. We now have partners with us who help look at this.\n(Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 2)\nAlthough the relationships evolved from a mutual need situation, the selection of\npartners was based on rational trust (Nooteboom, 2003). That is, the tier below\nhad to show competence and intentions to conform to the impositions put upon them\nfrom above.\nOnly we are healthy enough to invest a huge amount of money for this project,\nand [have the] human resources, [and the] technical background. Those three\nfactors. Our process itself is quite lean in its design. It was designed that way.\n(Japanese materials supplier, interviewee 1)\nWe have invested [a] very huge [amount of] money to build our new facilities\nfor the [new aircraft model]. [The airframe manufacturer] is applying lean\n[systems]. They are directing us to build under their instructions, [and] learning\nlean concepts. Our general manager and executive have changed their mind. We\nmust be lean. So we are trying to be lean. Our suppliers stay in previous situation.\nFirst, we must learn, then we will teach them. (Japanese structural supplier,\ninterviewee 1)\nFirst-tier suppliers with a long history of compliance with the airframe manufacturer\nsatisfied the initial criteria for rational trust.\nAnother one is [our] accumulated role of history with the airframe manufacturer\n[of] more than 10 years. So this activity, the reliability of us has been increased.\nThis is quite [an] important factor [for] why we are selected. (Japanese materials\nsupplier, interviewee 1)\nConclusively, a complex system of interacting instruments was used for initializing new\nrelationships. First, the airframe manufacturer used the mutual need situation as an\ninstrument for proposing change. Simultaneously, the key suppliers could use the\nrational trust they had built up with the airframe manufacturer as an instrument\nwhereby they would be selected as risk-sharing partners. Second, the airframe\nmanufacturer used their power as an instrument to change contracts. Simulta-\nneously, the key suppliers used their power of unique expertise, financial resources\nand access to their local markets to negotiate their position in the supply chain.\nInstruments for Developing Close Relationships \u2013 Process Promotion\nThe interviewees realized that it is beneficial to develop relationships based on more trust\nand transparency. One approach that could potentially develop into mutual\nexpectations and into long-term relationships occurred when a supplier was\nencouraged to develop their products for their own future benefits. The supplier\nthereby became more innovative at the same time as the customer received more\ninnovative systems and units of systems. By developing their expertise these lower\ntier suppliers changed their relationships by becoming suppliers of whole units. In\nthese hierarchical regimes, first-tier suppliers actually empowered low cost economy\n(LCE) suppliers to become more trusted by letting them make simple parts first;\nthereby letting them gradually learn, develop competence and thus develop closer\nrelationships to their customer. However, creative initiatives are not advantageous for\nan aircraft model if they are not introduced based on mutual expectations. These\nmutual expectations must come about through a collective object formation process\non what kinds of innovations fit airline demands at the same time as they fit the\nproduction systems of the aircraft model.\nTo develop relationships takes a lot of that informal conversation in trust and cre-\nditability through your words. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 2)\nAnd developing a relationship we try to get more trust in that relationship and more\ntransparency in that relationship. Relationships are a very cyclic thing. Partly\nbecause we haven\u2019t got clear commodity strategies, we tend to be very dependent\non the chemistry between CEO of a suppliers and the appropriate senior person in-\nhouse. I think the relationship side of it and supplier selection is really based on\nwho you know. (Engine supplier, interviewee 1)\nIf we identify something we want to work at together with a supplier then we will\nhave an Early Suppliers Engagement contract. And that contract clarifies who\nowns the intellectual property. And we use that value of the IP as part of the benefit\nof working with the suppliers. [It] gives them the opportunity to exploit that\ntechnology. (Engine supplier, interviewee 2)\nWe give the LCE suppliers a development plan. Start them [off] with fairly simple\nstuff. You are building the relationship on maybe some machine part, and then\nyou start to step up to complete design and manufacture of an actuator or an\nentire gearbox or something like that. (European mechanical systems supplier,\ninterviewee 2)\nSo we have a supplier that comes up with a really good idea. But our customer says:\nwe are not going to accept that. They want a stable thing. Also when a supplier\ncomes up with a new idea and technology, getting it on an existing programme is\nvery difficult in terms of incorporation. We are learning that we have to get better\nco-ordination on where they are spending their R&D money. (Airframe manufacturer,\ninterviewee 3)\nTriangular relationships between a first-tier supplier, western prototype suppliers and\nLCE mass producers of a unit illustrate a collective approach to a global\nproduction dilemma situation.\nAs far as supplier relationships are concerned, we are trying to involve some of\nour traditional suppliers in co-operative arrangements with [suppliers in] low cost\neconomies. So that means, the machined [parts] suppliers would be involved at\nthe prototyping stage. The parts in the volume production phase may be offloaded\nto a low cost country area. (Electrical systems supplier, interviewee 1)\nDeveloping supply chain relationships, as the case shows, is not a\nstraightforward process of implementation. Despite the point of departure, there is\nan intention to collaborate. Beyond the point of the contract agreement, the\ndevelopmental process relies on very individual interactions in the boundary zone\n(Figure 3) between the companies.\nDistinct cultural boundaries create another dilemma in yet another diffuse boundary zone\n(Figure 3) between companies in the supply chain. Although the situation is between\nrisk- sharing partners, this is most typically exemplified by the difference between\nJapanese and American practices (Cristiano et al., 2000). The Japanese individual\nassumes collective obedience to the system and the level above, and therefore\nassumes power difference and distance to strangers. On contrast, the American\nindividual would relate to a more individualistic regime of low power difference and\nsmall distance to strangers and more freedom of action for the individual.\nYou literally have to watch the Japanese all the way to get them to [perform],\nhandholding, walking through [the process at] every level of their organization to\nget them to go at the risk level and speed we need to go ahead. (Airframe\nmanufacturer, interviewee 5)\nThe boundary zone therefore becomes even more diffuse when one partner company\nhas to guide another partner due to different cultural performance expectations.\nThese problems are therefore not specific to risk-sharing partnerships, but are due\nto mismatch of collaborative skills across cultural boundaries.\nHowever, collaboration across company interfaces is not only a challenge between\nAsian and Western companies. As the case shows, integrating the global network\nof airplane structure risk-sharing partners also needs substantial developmental\nattention.\nThe airplane structures suppliers are difficult to integrate. The co-ordination and\nintegration is maybe one of the keys to successful companies. We see ourselves\nas large-scale integrators. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 5)\nAs the risk-sharing relationships\u2019 intended collective practices are not fully\nimplemented, it means that the airframe manufacturer as a large-scale\nintegrator still has to make impositions on suppliers. Thus in line with Cox\u2019s\n(2004) argument, the interdependence between risk-sharing partners and the domi-\nnance by the airframe manufacturer is necessary for the development of these\nsuppliers and for making the supply chain effective.\nTop-down or bottom-up innovations are realities in any kind of customer\/supplier\nrelationship. However, neither encourages collaboration as mutual expectations are not\nmet. Whether it is in relationships between risk-sharing partners or between different\ntiers in the supply chain, identifying something together takes place in a boundary\nzone of mutual expectations. This collective object formation for identifying the \u2018new\u2019\ntogether can thus be made to fit the process of production as well as customer\nneeds. The main thing is that those affected by constructing something new are\ninvolved in decision-making processes. Although risk-sharing partnerships are\nsupposed to enhance innovation through bringing together a diversity of expertise and\nthe financial resources to invest in exploration and innovative solutions, in this case\nthese relationships are still at a developmental stage. It seems that different and\nestablished company routines of fixed behaviour (Allen, 2001) are inhibiting the\nability to learn outside existing boundaries and thereby to participate in an object\nformation across company boundaries.\nInstruments for Sustaining Close Relationships and Innovation\nAs important as it was to destroy obsolete artefacts, it was important to establish\nnew enduring artefacts to support new forms of relationships. The question will\ntherefore always be whether new enduring artefacts such as contracts, e-portals,\ndesign and engineering structure adjustment programmes and product planning\ntools can be effectively used across company interfaces not only at present but also\nare flexible enough for the supply chain to sustain into the future.\n[For] the integration of communication and data transfer, we have developed\nportals in our systems of design and engineering that enable us to work with our\nsuppliers and researchers and partners at a completely virtual basis. (Airframe\nmanufacturer, interviewee 4)\nSustaining close supply chain relationships requires effort beyond establishing enduring\nartefacts. Compared to sustaining relationships within a single firm, sustaining\nrelationships between firms is more complex. This is because the distance and\npower issues may be more pronounced in a supply chain than within an individual\nfirm. First, people are separated physically by interacting from different\nlocalities, making it more difficult to build up the trust that naturally evolves\nbetween people in daily face-to-face contact. Second, there is an inherent power\npresent in customer\/supplier relationships. The risk- sharing partnership, however,\ninvites at least a decrease in power difference between partners due to the strong\ninterdependence the unique diverse expertise held by each partner gives. Therefore\nto take advantage of this diversity, it is realized that face-to-face and other more\ndirect personal interaction across company boundaries are paramount for\nnurturing relationships. Multi-voicedness is represented through personal\nrelationships. These serve as nodes between firms, and echoes Engelstad and\nGustavsen\u2019s (1993, p. 244) findings. They claim that the network can be seen as\nconsisting not of the participating organizations but of groups of actors linked to\neach other where the groups operate according to the principle of a democratic\ndialogue internally as well as in relation to each other.\nToday it is much more of an open communication, working together, and [with] con-\ntinuous improvement. The sustaining part is characterized by close relationships and\ncollaboration. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 5)\nThings like schedules, purchase orders, the transactional parts of the\nrelationship happen via e-portals through [the] internet now with all our suppliers. It\nis an excellent system. Suppliers like it and it works very well. What we lost was\nthe interaction between people. But we now have material controllers who own\nrelationships with suppliers. And they know the person, and that relationship is\nbetter. (Electrical systems supplier, interviewee 2)\nThe types of relationships with customers and suppliers tend to be very individual\nkind of responses. It depends upon the company you have relationships with,\nand what their philosophy is. (Japanese materials supplier interviewee 2)\nIn this case, practising development and sustainability of the risk-sharing partnerships\nare done in the context of a new aircraft model development. This context changes\ndue to the disturbances between the connected activities (Rose-Anderssen et al.,\n2005). As the case shows, these disturbances come about as there are imperfect\nactions promoting corrective actions in a dynamic context of transformation. Although\nthe relationships are immature, the collective investment in unique expertise and\nfinancial resources are producing very promising outcomes in terms of a conceptually\nnew aircraft. Thus, even if the boundary zone between firms regarding details may\nsometimes be diffuse, due to the open space for negotiations and peer guidance\nthe risk- sharing partnership gives, successful innovation is achieved.\nThroughout the world, our new airplane is recognized as an extraordinarily high tech-\nnology advanced aircraft. People believed that we have stepped out a very\ninnovative solution. We have stretched the boundaries of technology, offered a\nunique solution that has never been offered to the industry before. We are an\nextremely risk aversive company. And I think this is an indication we have started\nto accept risk and be innovative. Quite honestly we have to be global. We have\nthose relationships. So globally, I think those relationships are really\nimportant. (Airframe manufacturer, interviewee 2)\nSo we go into production of [the new airplane] around, well it starts next year.\nAnd it wraps up quite quickly because they have been very successful [with that]\naircraft. (European mechanical systems supplier, interviewee 2)\nIn conclusion, shared ownership to building an aircraft, multi-voicedness and suc-\ncessful innovation of new aircraft became instruments for sustaining relationships.\nA successful outcome in terms of an innovative product can be argued to be the\nstrongest ingredient for nurturing risk-sharing partnerships. And this helps develop the\nrelationship further.\nRisk-Sharing Partnerships as Instruments for Innovation\nThe model of the instrumentality of relationships (Figure 1) has been used to mould\nthe text in these subsections into an interactive model of supply chain relationship\nevolution. This complex evolutionary model confirms risk-sharing partnerships as\nstrong instruments for innovation (Figure 4).\nThe aim of risk-sharing partnerships is to go beyond simple technology transfer. It is\nabout knowledge and technology transformation as a collective process for creating\nentirely new concepts of aircraft technology. As such, it is interesting as it\nexpands the capacities to go beyond present capabilities to achieve competitive\nadvantage in the global space. The collective investment into this expansion is what\nrisk-sharing is about.\nWestern suppliers as well as their global competitors were initially invited to present\ntheir up-front capabilities to engage in risk- sharing partnerships. Sadly, many\nWestern suppliers are not prepared to do that.\nWe need to find suppliers who can grow and develop, and contribute to the\ninnovation process. I think, by and large, most Western suppliers have not\nwoken up to this reality. They can\u2019t develop. They can\u2019t be our suppliers as we\nneed to go forward. (European mechanical systems supplier, interviewee 2)\nThat meaning we need to take more of a risk letting them get on with it.\nThe question is; there are not many suppliers that are big enough to carry on\na mass project development. (Engine supplier, interviewee 2)\nHowever, risk-sharing partnerships are open and transparent relationships for the\nsharing of experiences. Knowledge created by partners during the processes of\naircraft development is shared. They are therefore gaining knowledge they would\nnot necessarily have developed alone. To enhance competitive advantage, the\nairframe manufacturer invites the best expertise available from the global space\ninto risk-sharing partnerships. Innovation is therefore not out- sourced or\ntransferred; it is created within the risk-sharing partnership. Although knowledge is\nshared, early supplier engagement contracts may protect intellectual property\nrights.\nChanging practices to support risk-sharing partnerships is a major step in the\nevolution of commercial aerospace supply chains. Risk- sharing partnerships facilitate\ngoing beyond the limitations of incremental innovation. It is about the collective\napproach to airplane technology transformation. Advances in new concepts in aircraft\ndesign based on advances in material technology help facilitate that. Pritchard and\nMacPherson\u2019s (2004, 2007) concern about substantial technology transfer from US\nFigure 4. Risk-Sharing Partnerships as Instruments for Innovation\nprime contractors to non-Western companies,\nneed to evolve with the ever\nas risk- sharing partners to survive.\nRisk-sharing partnerships have in this case\nthe creation of a complete innovative solution for a\naircraft represents a totally new aircraft concept whilst\non innovations to various part of an existing aircraft type.\nThe risk-sharing partnership has been\npower of expertise by suppliers is a move away\nvoice towards the multi-voiced approa\nfinancial strength and expertise held by each partner\ndeveloped object has facilitated exploration and learning with\ninnovations.

This was done using\nan evolutionary model of the transformation of relationship practices. Within the\nframework of the model, a case of one supply chain was analysed using a combination\nof activity theory and complex systems thinking.\nThrough the perspectives of activity theory and complex systems thinking, the\ntransformation of a supply chain relationship form from the level of collaborative\npractices to the collective practices of risk-sharing partnerships was discussed. It is\nthe strong collective effort by the risk-sharing partners to develop common objects for\ntheir shared activities that connects and develops the diversity of expertise and\nopinions into a dynamic process that could otherwise have led to pulling the supply\nchain in multiple directions. Since this supply chain is still immature in terms of object\ncomprehension for some parts, guidance is needed to make the object clearer.\nKratzer et al.\u2019s (2006) argument that creative performance and innovation can be\npositively affected by a diversity of influences is supported by this paper. In previous\ncollaborative supply chain relationships, the airframe manufacturer took most of the\nrisk associated with innovation, development and production (Williams et al., 2002).\nThis domination by the airframe manufacturer is in this case gradually transformed\ninto a more multi-voiced relationship of diverse company capabilities. The expert\npartners are given the responsibility to develop their high technology products\nwithin the context of the common object. This is neither top-down nor bottom-up\ninnovation but an individual contribution in a collective setting.\nThe case discussed in this paper indicates the synergetic effects of bringing together\na diversity of high technology expert companies to produce radical innovation.\nImplementing global risk-sharing partnerships is a complex developmental process\nas they have to be adapted across different cultural boundaries. The practical\nlearning is therefore that there are no standard solutions to the implementation\nprocesses. They are subject to trial and error in diffuse boundary zones of collective\nobject formation processes of trust-building and mutual expectation development.\nReferences\nAllen, P.M.
