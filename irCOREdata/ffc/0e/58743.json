This study focuses3\non the spatial dependence in extreme river flows with the aim being to map a measure of spatial4\ndependence of extreme values over Great Britain. We analyse data series of daily mean flows as5\nthese exist in long concurrent records of high quality. To provide an insight into how differences6\nin regional meteorology and catchment characteristics influence spatial flood risk we also analyse7\nthe spatial dependence in extreme daily precipitation totals, and carry out an analysis of the8\ndependence between catchment characteristics and a measure of spatial dependence in extreme9\nriver flows.10\nThe spatial risk of flooding (or extreme precipitation) at a set of m gauged sites, denoted11\n\u2206 = {1, . . . ,m}, can be described in many ways. For a spatial risk measure to have generic12\napplicability it is important that it is not specific to the set of gauged sites. Therefore we13\nmeasure how extreme an event is relative to the distribution at each site, i.e. on the probability14\nscale. The distributions of the variables will be different over all m sites but the probability scale15\nis common over all m sites. Thus levels at two sites are viewed to be equally extreme if they16\nboth correspond to the pth quantile of the variable at each site even though their actual flow17\nlevels or precipitation amounts can differ considerably. It is helpful, however, for interpretation18\nto present results in terms of return periods of events instead of quantiles of the variable. For a19\nprocess which is observed daily, with extreme events lasting on average k days, the pth quantile20\ncorresponds to the T year event, with21\nT =\nk\n365(1\u2212 p)\n, (1.1)\nprovided T > 1 year to avoid issues of seasonality. As the return period depends on k, which22\nwill be different for different processes, we typically focus on the probability scale p but for23\napplications we will present results in terms of return periods.24\nOur approach is to derive an estimate of spatial dependence centred at each of a network of25\ngauged sites indexed by \u2206. For each site i \u2208 \u2206, let \u2206i(d) \u2286 \u2206 denote the sites in \u2206, excluding site26\ni, that are within d km of site i. We will evaluate the spatial dependence between the variables27\n2\nat the sites in \u2206i(d) conditional upon an extreme event, i.e. an event which exceeded the T1\nyear return level, occurring at site i. Our main measure of this conditional spatial dependence2\nwill be Ni(p, d), the expected proportion of sites in \u2206i(d) that exceed their pth quantile (or3\nequivalently T year return level) during an event in which site i exceeds its pth quantile (T year4\nreturn level), we define Ni(p, d) precisely in Section 3. In this paper we estimate the measure5\nNi(p, d), and related dependence summaries, for a range of T (equivalently p), including very6\nlarge T , and for a range of d.7\nThis raises a number of issues including: How are suitable events in spatial series identified?8\nHow is Ni(p, d) estimated, particularly when T (equivalently p) is large as empirical estimates9\nfail when T exceeds the observed amount of overlapping data series? If a model for dependence10\nis to be used can it be selected to be sufficiently general to apply to all possible combinations of11\nsites? How are missing data to be handled as there are limited concurrent data when many sites12\nare considered simultaneously? And how are confidence intervals for the estimate evaluated?13\nThis is essentially a multivariate extreme values problem: given that an extreme event14\noccured at site i we are concerned with the occurence of extreme values at sites in \u2206i(d) during15\nthe same event. Though a number of measures of bivariate and multivariate dependence have16\nbeen developed in the hydrological literature to describe dependence in extreme values, see Dales17\nand Reed (1989) and Svensson and Jones (2002), they are empirical. Hence, they are restricted18\nto measuring dependence at return periods at most as long as the length of the data series. They19\nare also dependence measures for specific subclasses of (multivariate extreme value) distributions20\nso will produce biased estimates when these distributional choices are inappropriate. Another21\nfeature of these methods is that for each extreme event, observations are required at all sites,22\nso events with missing components at any site are removed.23\nWe use the methodology developed by Keef et al. (2009) which extends the approach devel-24\noped by Heffernan and Tawn (2004). This method adopts an asymptotically justified dependence25\nmodel over sites and time which accounts for time lags between variables at different sites. The26\napproach has a number of benefits: it allows extrapolation to events of any return period; it27\ncompares favourably with other available methods in terms of its ability to model a broad range28\nof dependence structures; it is applicable to a large number of sites; and it accounts for missing29\ndata. In using these methods we make the assumption that fluvial flooding in the winter (higher30\n3\nflow) months has the same spatial characteristics as fluvial flooding in the summer (lower flow)1\nmonths. The simplest alternative to this assumption is to split the data up into higher and2\nlower flow months. The difficulty with this alternative is that there are very few floods in lower3\nflow months. In Environment Agency (2009) almost no difference was found between estimating4\nNi(p, d) using data from the full year and only data from the higher flow months.5\nThe paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the network of data used in the study6\ntogether with some information about the key covariates; in Section 3 a summary is given of7\nthe methods of Keef et al. (2009); in Section 4 maps over Great Britain of spatial dependence in8\ndaily river flows and precipitation are presented and interpreted; and in Section 5 conclusions9\nare summarised.10\n2 Data selection and key covariates11\nFor our analysis of daily precipitation data we use data from 256 raingauges across Great Britain12\n(GB) provided by the UK Met Office. For the daily mean river flow we use data from a set of 27113\nstations in GB provided by the National River Flow Archive (NRFA) (Marsh and Hannaford,14\n2008). For the river flow series the selected stations have on average 40 years of data with a15\nminimum of 20 years and maximum of 60 years. For the raingauges almost all of the selected16\nsites have 40 years of data, mostly corresponding to the same period, since 1961, so have long17\nspans of overlapping series from gauge to gauge.18\nThough many more stations\/gauges exist we selected sites which are recognised as having19\nhigh quality data, long records with limited missing data, that provide a good spatial coverage20\nof GB and that have long periods of overlap with each other. The stations were also selected21\nto have as homogeneous records as possible; this selection avoided stations influenced by the22\nconstruction of new dams and flood defence systems or stations with catchments which have23\nexperienced major changes in land use. When stations that are very close to each other (less24\nthan around 25 km apart) were identified as appropriate only the station with the longest records25\nwas selected.26\nFigures 1 and 2 shows the locations of the selected river flow stations and raingauges respec-27\ntively. In some areas of GB it was not possible to obtain a network of similar density of good28\nquality river flow records. For example, in north-west Scotland and in the East Anglian Fens29\n4\nthe density of the NRFA gauging stations is more sparse relative to the rest of GB. Due to the1\nlarge number of raingauges to choose from we were able to achieve a better spatial coverage2\nof the selected raingauges. However, the density is still not uniform over GB, with the density3\nbeing notably lower in the Scottish Highlands and Wales.4\nFigure 1 shows the baseflow index (BFI) and areas of the selected catchments. The BFI5\nmay be thought of as a measure of the proportion of the total discharge that derives from6\nstored sources, and is a way of indexing the catchment geology. Permeable rocks and soils can7\nstore more water, resulting in a higher baseflow and more sustained flow during periods of dry8\nweather. Impervious clay catchments with minimal lake and reservoir storage typically have9\nBFIs in the range 0.15\u2212 0.35, whereas a chalk stream may have a BFI greater than 0.9 (Marsh10\nand Hannaford, 2008). Figure 2 shows the raingauge altitudes and standard annual average11\nrainfalls (SAAR). The mapped SAAR values reveal a clear rainshadow effect. Precipitation in12\nnorthern and western Britain is predominantly of frontal origin, tending to fall in south-westerly13\nairflow, e.g. Manley (1970). Orographic enhancement of precipitation over mountainous areas14\ntherefore mean that south- and west-facing slopes receive considerably more precipitation than15\nareas to the east of the hills. In contrast, widespread and persistent precipitation in eastern16\nGB tends to occur in the onshore winds on the north side of depressions passing eastwards on17\na more southerly track, e.g. Mayes and Sutton (1997).18\nTwo sets of four river flow gauges each were used as an initial test dataset when developing19\nthe methods, and are used to demonstrate particular features of the dependence in Section 4.20\nThe gauges are located in south-east Scotland and in the Thames catchment in south England.21\nThey were chosen to contain only a small amount of missing data, and to represent different22\ncatchment characteristics. Table 1 shows the catchment area and BFI for the catchments of these23\ngauging stations, it shows that the Scottish rivers generally have a lower BFI than the Thames24\nrivers. They also tend to be hillier and smaller in catchment size. Nearly all the catchments are25\nessentially rural. The exception is the Thames at Kingston, the most downstream gauge on the26\nThames, which has mixed land use including urban areas.27\n5\n3 Methods1\n3.1 Strategy2\nConsider a set \u2206 of gauging sites, with hydrological variable Xi at gauging site i. The joint3\ndistribution of any multivariate random variable, X = {Xi, i \u2208 \u2206}, where each Xi, i \u2208 \u22064\nhas a continuous distribution function, can be separated into marginal distribution functions,5\nFi, i \u2208 \u2206 where Fi(x) = Pr(Xi < x), and the dependence structure. This separation of the joint6\ndistribution can be expressed as follows7\nPr(X1 \u2264 x1, . . . , Xm \u2264 xm) = C{F1(x1), . . . , Fm(xm)} (3.1)\nwhere C is a unique function, known as the copula, which determines the dependence structure8\nof X, see Joe (1997) and Nelsen (1999). The copula formulation separates the joint distribution9\ninto the m marginal distribution functions and a joint distribution function C for the variables10\non a common marginal distribution. In expression (3.1), C is the joint distribution function for11\nuniform [0, 1] variables, however the choice of common marginal distribution does not matter12\nand so in different studies different common marginal distribution forms are selected for the13\nconvenience of the problem.14\nFor the construction of our spatial dependence measure we are interested in the dependence15\nstructure of X only, and so we focus on the copula component of expression (3.1). Therefore16\nwe initially transform our variable X, e.g. river flow or precipitation, to a common marginal17\ndistribution. For the purposes of modelling extreme values it is best to use standard Gumbel18\nmargins as this scale induces the most linearity in the dependence (Heffernan and Tawn, 2004).19\nTherefore we transformX to Y , so that Y has standard Gumbel marginal distributions, through20\nthe transformation Yi = \u2212 log{\u2212 log[Fi(Xi)]} so that Pr(Yi \u2264 y) = exp[\u2212 exp(\u2212y)], for \u2212\u221e <21\ny < \u221e and i \u2208 \u2206. We denote the pth quantile of Yi, for each i, by yp. As all Fi, i \u2208 \u2206,22\nare unknown we use the empirical distribution function of Xi to estimate them, so it is only23\nthe ranks of X that we use and not the values themselves. An important consequence of this24\napproach is that the effect of measurement error (including random and systematic errors) on25\nflows is small for this analysis.26\nThe aim is to be able to estimate features of the distribution of a multivariate random27\n6\nvariable Y when Yi is large under the assumption that observations on Y are from a stationary1\ntime series. Let Y \u2212i denote Y with Yi removed. The strategy is first to model the marginal2\ndistribution of Yi, which is given due to our choice of Gumbel distribution. Then we model the3\nconditional distribution of Y \u2212i|Yi = y for large values of y. Here the conditional distribution is4\nthe distribution of all the other elements of Y given that Yi is fixed equal to y. We propose a5\nmodel motivated by asymptotic probabilistic theory for this conditional distribution as y \u2192\u221e.6\nWe assume that this model will be appropriate for all values of y above a high threshold u (in7\nthis paper we take u = y0.975 throughout), and use the observations of Y with Yi > u to fit this8\nmodel. Having fitted the conditional distribution the final stage is the estimation of features of9\nthe fitted distribution of Y when Yi > v where v \u2265 u.10\nThe key step in all this process is the modelling of the conditional distribution of Y \u2212i|Yi = y11\nfor large y as all subsequent aspects of the inference hinge on this step. This section focuses on12\nthis aspect. Heffernan and Tawn (2004) provide asymptotic theory which provides the basis for13\na model for the behaviour of the conditional distribution of Y \u2212i|Yi, when Yi is large, and they14\nperform inference for this model under the assumption that observations of Y are independent,15\nidentically distributed, and without missing values. Here we will focus on a special case of16\nthis model which appears appropriate for our applications to fluvial and precipitation extreme17\nvalue modelling. Specifically, we assume that all variables are non-negatively dependent. Full18\ndetails of the theory on which the model is based, the associated conditional models, and a19\ndiscussion of when it is appropriate to make simplifying assumptions such as those we make20\nhere are given in Heffernan and Tawn (2004) and Keef et al. (2009). In Sections 3.2 and 3.321\nwe describe the associated conditional model for extreme values in bivariate and multivariate22\ncases respectively. Then in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 we outline the extensions proposed by Keef23\net al. (2009) to cover temporal dependence and missing data. Our spatial dependence measure24\nis presented in Section 3.6 and the methods used to evaluate uncertainty are given in Section 3.7.25\n3.2 Bivariate model26\nConsider a high threshold u and any pair of sites i, j \u2208 \u2206. When the variables are non-negatively27\ndependent, the simplified version of Heffernan and Tawn\u2019s conditional model for Yj |Yi = y, when28\n7\ny > u, is1\nYj = \u03b1j|iy + y\n\u03b2j|iZj|i (3.2)\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03b1j|i \u2264 1 and \u2212\u221e < \u03b2j|i < 1 are parameters and Zj|i is a random variable with2\nnon-zero mean, independent of Yi, and with distribution function Gj|i(z) = Pr(Zj|i \u2264 z). The3\nrestrictions of this model are discussed in Heffernan and Tawn (2004). The formulation of the4\nmodel through expression (3.2) is a regression model of Yj upon Yi, for Yi being above the5\nthreshold u, with conditional mean and variance given by6\nE(Yj |Yi = y) = \u03b1j|iy + y\n\u03b2j|iE(Zj|i) and Var(Yj |Yi = y) = y\n2\u03b2j|iVar(Zj|i)\nfor y > u; with the quantities Zj|i being equivalent to the standardised residuals in a classical7\nregression model.8\nThe parameters \u03b1j|i and \u03b2j|i describe the strength of dependence between (Yi, Yj) when Yi9\nis large. Unlike classical regression, E(Zj|i) 6= 0, so the interpretation of \u03b1j|i and \u03b2j|i is not10\nas straight-forward as in a standard linear regression model. The parameter \u03b1j|i describes the11\noverall strength of dependence between the two variables, as \u03b1j|i increases the overall strength of12\ndependence between Yi and Yj increases. In contrast \u03b2j|i describes how the dependence changes13\nwith Yi; for positive values of \u03b2j|i the variance of Yj |Yi = y increases as y increases.14\nTo get a clearer impression of the roles of \u03b1j|i and \u03b2j|i consider the two examples given in15\nFigure 3 showing samples of (Yi, Yj) when Yi > 4.5, corresponding to when Yi is in the top 1%16\nof the standard Gumbel distribution. In the left hand plot both large and small values of Yj can17\noccur with large Yi, with large values of Yj occurring with large values of Yi more often than if18\n(Yi, Yj) were independent. In the right hand plot, only large values of Yj occur with large values19\nof Yi. This illustrates that large values of Yj can occur with large values of Yi if either \u03b1j|i is20\nlarge or if \u03b2j|i is large. However, small and large values of Yj occur with large Yi only when \u03b2j|i21\nis large.22\nThe two samples shown in Figure 3 illustrate different degrees of extremal dependence. To23\nhelp clarify the differences the associated probabilities of24\nPr(Yj > v|Yi > v) (3.3)\n8\nare also given in Figure 3 for v > 4.5. In each case we compare with the true value of probability1\n(3.3), which can be evaluated as we know the joint distribution of Y that was used to simulate2\nthese data. We see that both the true probability and its empirical estimate is larger for the3\nsecond sample than for the first indicating that the second parameter set (\u03b1j|i, \u03b2j|i) = (0.8, 0.1),4\nleads to a stronger form of positive extremal dependence.5\nThe strongest form of extremal dependence is asymptotic dependence which occurs when6\n\u03b1j|i = 1 and \u03b2j|i = 0 as probability (3.3) tends to a non-zero constant as v \u2192 \u221e. In contrast,7\nwhen \u03b1j|i < 1 then probability (3.3) tends to zero as v \u2192 \u221e, with this case being termed8\nasymptotic independence. Asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence are discussed9\nin Coles et al. (1999) and their relation to the Heffernan and Tawn model is discussed in Heffernan10\nand Tawn (2004) and Keef et al. (2009). Under independence of Yj and Yi then P (Yj > v|Yi >11\nv) = P (Yj > v) \u2248 e\n\u2212v, for large v.12\nEstimates \u03b1\u02c6j|i and \u03b2\u02c6j|i of the parameters \u03b1j|i and \u03b2j|i are obtained using likelihood methods13\nunder a working assumption that Zj|i follows a Normal distribution. Specifically we assume that14\neach random variable Yj |Yi = y, for y > u, j \u2208 \u2206\\{i} has mean \u00b5j|i(y), and standard deviation,15\n\u03c3j|i(y), respectively given by16\n\u00b5j|i(y) = \u03b1j|iy + \u00b5j|iy\n\u03b2j|i\n17\n\u03c3j|i(y) = \u03c3j|iy\n\u03b2j|i .\nThis enables us to estimate the parameters \u03b1j|i, \u03b2j|i, \u00b5j|i and \u03c3j|i by applying a numerical18\nmaximisation procedure to the following function19\n\u2212\ntj\u2211\nt=1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0log{\u03c3j|i(yi,t) + 12\n{\nyj,t \u2212 \u00b5j|i(yi,t)\n\u03c3j|i(yi,t)\n}2\uf8f9\uf8fb ,\nwhere tj is the number of observations of yj when yi > u. This method of parameter estimation20\ndoes not introduce a noticeable bias in the parameter estimates. Heffernan and Tawn (2004)21\nfound some restrictions on Gj|i but that these were insufficient to justify using any parametric22\nfamily, so the distribution Gj|i is estimated using the empirical distribution of the estimated23\nstandardised residuals24\nZ\u02c6j|i =\nYj \u2212 \u03b1\u02c6j|iYi\nY\n\u03b2\u02c6j|i\ni\nfor Yi > u. (3.4)\n9\nThe key to the choice of the threshold u is that for Yi > u then Yi and Zj|i are independent.1\nThe theory suggests that there should always be some level u above which independence is2\nan appropriate assumption. Therefore u needs to be selected large enough to achieve this3\nindependence, with a test of independence guiding this choice, but u needs to be small enough4\nto ensure there are sufficient data with Yi > u to be able to estimate the model reliably.5\nTo derive the distribution of any features of the joint distribution of (Yi, Yj), such as max-6\nimum of (Yi, Yj), or Yi + Yj we need to study the behaviour of function h of (Yi, Yj). The7\ndistribution of any functional, h(Yi, Yj) of (Yi, Yj) with Yi > v, for v > u can be derived by8\nMonte Carlo methods by simulating samples from the fitted distribution (Yi, Yj)|Yi > v and9\nevaluating h for each replicate. To do this first simulate Yi > v giving a value y\n\u2217 say and second10\nsimulate Yj |Yi = y\n\u2217. As a consequence of the Gumbel marginal distribution for Yi, the simu-11\nlation from Yi|Yi > u, when u is large, corresponds to simulating from a standard exponential12\ndistribution shifted by u. The key to simulating from the conditional Yj |Yi = y\n\u2217 is that under13\nthe conditional model (3.2) Yi and Zj|i are independent. Hence independently of Yi, the variable14\nZj|i is simulated from the estimated distribution Gj|i, i.e. Zj|i is sampled from replicates of Z\u02c6j|i,15\nand Yj is derived using expression (3.2). Using a similar strategy the distribution of the func-16\ntional can be obtained under independence and perfect dependence by repeatedly simulating Yj17\nindependently of Yi or taking Yj = Yi. These cases are sometimes helpful to assess the impact18\nof dependence. The sample size of the simulated sample is taken to be sufficiently large that the19\nMonte Carlo component of the uncertainty of the empirical estimate is very small. The level20\nv, v > u, can be arbitrarily large and so the proposed strategy provides estimates of features21\nabout the distribution of Y within the observed tail of Yi through to extrapolation beyond the22\nmaximum Yi observation.23\nTaking u = 4.5 we illustrate using this method for the simulated data to estimate Pr(Yj >24\nv|Yi > v), for v > u in Figure 3. Using the simulation method for evaluating an estimate of25\nPr(Yj > v|Yi > v) under the fitted model as described in Section 3.1, we see in Figure 3 that26\nthe model-based estimate matches well with both the empirical and true values in the range of27\nthe data but continues to give a smooth extrapolation to the empirical estimate and as we know28\nhere the true value we can also see it gives a good estimate of the true value of Pr(Yj > v|Yi > v)29\nfor v beyond the largest observed Yi value. This may not be too surprising as the basic model30\n10\nformulation is correct, but recall that the \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters needed to be estimated and only1\na nonparametric estimate of the form of the distribution of Zj|i was used.2\n3.3 Multivariate model3\nNow consider the extension of equation (3.2) to the multivariate case. The simplified Heffernan4\nand Tawn model is5\nY \u2212i = \u03b1|iy + y\n\u03b2|iZ |i (3.5)\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03b1|i \u2264 1 and \u2212\u221e < \u03b2|i < 1 are parameter vectors of dimension |\u2206| \u2212 1 and Z |i is a6\n|\u2206| \u2212 1 dimensional random variable with joint distribution function G|i and is independent of7\nYi. Here vector algebra is to be interpreted as componentwise.8\nModel (3.5) is a multivariate regression model with for every j \u2208 \u2206 with j 6= i the jth9\nmarginal component being identical to the bivariate model (3.2). By parametrically modelling10\nthe dependence of each component of Y \u2212i on Yi we remove some of the dependence between the11\nY \u2212i variables. An explanation of this is that if all variables in Y \u2212i are positively associated with12\nYi, they will all tend to be large or small together. This tendency is mostly captured by the \u03b113\nand \u03b2 parameters. Once the common dependence on Yi is accounted for, the residual variation,14\ndetermined by the joint distribution G|i of the standardised multivariate residuals Z |i, is then15\nmodelled. We anticipate that Z |i will have weaker dependence than Y \u2212i; for example if Y \u2212i16\nare conditionally independent given Yi then the Y \u2212i can possess arbitrarily strong dependence17\nbut Z |i will be independent.18\nThis residual dependence is captured by the inclusion of a non-parametric model for G|i19\nwith the empirical joint distribution being used. This corresponds to empirically estimating20\nthe standardised residuals given by expression (3.4) for all j \u2208 \u2206, to provide an estimate Z\u02c6 |i21\nfor simultaneous observations. Thus our model for G|i has a dependence structure between22\nthe components of Z |i which is identical to the sample dependence structure in their observed23\nvalues. The assumption of a non-parametric model for G|i is not as restrictive for extrapolation24\nof the distribution of Y for large Yi as in some other modelling contexts. The reason for this25\nis that the key elements to extrapolation of this distribution are the marginal distribution of Yi26\nand the expectation and variance structure of the conditional distribution in the regression, all27\nof which are modelled parametrically.28\n11\n3.4 Multivariate-temporal model1\nLet Yj,t denote variable Yj on day t. By assuming stationarity of the multivariate time series we2\nare able to model the distribution of the variable at site j at a lag \u03c4 in relation to an extreme3\nvalue at site i, i.e. the conditional distribution Yj,t+\u03c4 |Yi,t, for Yi,t > u, for any t, \u03c4 and j using the4\nmethods of Heffernan and Tawn (2004). The methods extend directly with additional notation5\nto denote the lag, i.e. parameters \u03b1\n(\u03c4)\nj|i and \u03b2\n(\u03c4)\nj|i and associated variable Z\n(\u03c4)\nj|i . An exploratory6\nsummary measure of bivariate dependence that we use in this case is7\nP\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p) = Pr (Yj,t+\u03c4 > yp|Yi,t > yp) , (3.6)\nso, P\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p) is the probability that Yj exceeds yp at lag \u03c4 from Yi exceeding yp. As p \u2192 1 then8\nP\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p) \u2192 0 if \u03b1\n(\u03c4)\nj|i < 1 but tends to a non-zero constant if \u03b1\n(\u03c4)\nj|i = 1. We consider two special9\nfeatures of this measure, \u03c4max, the value of \u03c4 for which P\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p) is a maximum, and the value of10\nthe conditional probability at this lag, P\n(\u03c4max)\nj|i (p).11\nSimilarly the methods can be applied to lagged values of a single series, i.e. Yi,t+\u03c4 |Yi,t, giving12\na useful measure for clustering of extremes in a single series to be P\n(\u03c4)\ni|i (p), and a multivariate13\nextension of measure (3.6) is studied by Keef et al. (2009).14\nBecause the peak values at the different sites may occur some time apart a dependence15\nmeasure of more practical value is given by16\nQ\n(L)\nj|i (p) = Pr\n(\nmax\n\u03c4\u2208AL\nYj,t+\u03c4 > yp|Yi,t > yp\n)\n(3.7)\nwhere AL = {\u2212L,\u2212L + 1, . . . , 0, . . . , L}, so Q\n(L)\nj|i (p) is the probability that Yj has at least one17\nexceedance of yp within L days of Yi exceeding yp. Here the choice of the maximal lag L18\ndepends on the temporal dependence at each site and the cross-series lags which we identify in19\nSections 4.2 and 4.3. As p \u2192 1 then Q\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p) \u2192 0 if \u03b1\n(\u03c4)\nj|i < 1 for all \u03c4 \u2208 AL but tends to a20\nnon-zero constant if there is at least one lag \u03c4 \u2208 AL for which \u03b1\n(\u03c4)\nj|i = 1.21\n3.5 Handling missing data22\nKeef et al. (2009) show full details of the method for an arbitrary missing data pattern. To23\nillustrate the approach for handling missing data here consider three sites (m = 3), with site 124\n12\nbeing the conditioning site, all values of Y being observed at all times except time t for which1\n(Y1,t, Y2,t) are observed, with Y1,t > u, but Y3,t is missing. It follows that Z3|1 at time t, denoted2\nZ3|1,t, is missing but Z2|1,t is observed. The strategy is to replace the missing value of Z3|1,t by3\na sample from the conditional distribution of Z3|1,t|Z2|1,t. For the general case of m sites the4\nconditional distribution of interest is the distribution of all the missing elements of Z |i given all5\nthe observed elements of this vector.6\nThe form of the conditional distribution arises from making an assumption about the copula7\nfamily for the joint distribution of Z |i = (Z2|1, Z3|1). Specifically, a Gaussian copula is assumed8\n(Joe, 1997) with its parameters estimated from the observed pairs of Z |i. This assumption9\nis only made in estimating the conditional distribution of the missing values. The method of10\nestimating the distribution of the observed values does not change. Consequently, estimation11\nof features of the joint distribution can be derived using the simulation methods described in12\nSection 3.1 with missing components simply replaced by sample values from the conditional13\ndistribution of the missing component given the observed component.14\n3.6 Spatial dependence measures15\nWe can now specify the spatial dependence measure Ni(p, d) that we introduced in Section 1.16\nGiven that Yi,t > yp, then Ni(p, d) is the expected proportion of stations in \u2206i(d) that exceed17\nyp for at least one lag in the same event (i.e. within a lag of L days). Mathematically this is18\nexpressed as19\nNi(p, d) =\nE (# {j \u2208 \u2206i(d) : max\u03c4\u2208AL Yj,t+\u03c4 > yp} |Yi,t > yp)\n#{j \u2208 \u2206i(d)}\n, (3.8)\nwhere 0 \u2264 Ni(p, d) \u2264 1 with larger Ni(p, d) corresponding to stronger extremal dependence in20\nthe region around site i. By estimating the expected proportion of sites instead of the expected21\nnumber of sites we aim to overcome the property that sites are not evenly distributed so that22\nthe number of neighbouring sites varies from site-to-site.23\nChanges in Ni(p, d) with p increasing is an indication of how the spatial dependence varies24\nas events become more extreme at site i. If \u03b1\n(\u03c4)\nj|i < 1 for all \u03c4 \u2208 AL and all j \u2208 \u2206i(d) then25\nNi(p, d) \u2192 0 as p \u2192 1. So it is possible to have strong spatial dependence between sites for26\nmoderate return periods but for larger return periods the dependence weakens or becomes so27\n13\nweak that all the very largest extreme events can only occur at single sites in the network. We1\nwill also assess how Ni(p, d) changes with d, we expect it to decrease as d is increased as the2\nadditional gauging stations that are included will tend to be more widely separated and so are3\nlikely to have less dependence between them.4\n3.7 Uncertainty5\nAs our model is semi-parametric with a large number of parameters, 2\n\u2211m\ni=1 |\u2206i(d)|, a natural6\napproach to evaluating uncertainty is to use the block bootstrap. We explored a number of ways7\nfor selecting blocks to correspond to independent and identical events (Keef, 2007) but concluded8\nthat for a generic application of the methods one-year blocks were ideal as they accounted for9\nboth the longer range dependence experienced at some sites and seasonality at all sites. These10\none-year blocks were chosen to run from 1st August to 31st July to minimise the chance of11\nsplitting an extreme fluvial event into different blocks.12\n4 Results and discussion13\n4.1 Introduction14\nIn this section we show the results of estimating the dependence measures of Section 3.4, namely15\nP\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p), \u03c4max, P\n(\u03c4max)\nj|i (p) and Q\n(L)\nj|i (p), for flow stations and precipitation gauges in GB. Through-16\nout we take yp = u so p = 0.975. As discussed in Section 3.1 we estimate all these features,17\nand Ni(p, d), of the joint distribution by using empirical estimates derived from a large sam-18\nple of simulated values generated from the fitted distribution. The spatial dependence analysis19\npresented focuses on areas with radii, d, of 30 and 60 km. See Keef (2007) for more details on20\nresults for d of 90 and 120 km.21\nIn all cases we only present results for the model-based estimator developed in Section 3.22\nHowever, as in Figure 3, we assessed the fit of our models by comparing the model-based esti-23\nmates with empirical estimates over the range for which the empirical estimates are reliable and24\nfound a good agreement. Examples of such comparisons and more general diagnostic procedures25\nfor these models are given by Heffernan and Tawn (2004) and Keef et al. (2009).26\n14\n4.2 Temporal dependence in individual series1\nTo illustrate the use of the dependence measures introduced in Section 3.4 we first apply the2\nmethods to explore the temporal dependence in river flow extremes at a single site. The temporal3\nextremal dependence in river flows was estimated using P\n(\u03c4)\ni|i (p), equation (3.6). A value of4\nP\n(\u03c4)\ni|i (p) = 0.5 means that there is a 50% chance that, conditional on variate Yi being large5\n(above the pth quantile) on any given day t, then it will also be large on day t + \u03c4 . Figure 46\nshows the results for |\u03c4 | \u2264 50 days, for the Tweed at Peebles and the Thames at Eynsham.7\nThe faster responding Tweed catchment shows a relatively quick drop in dependence over a few8\ndays, whereas in the larger, flatter, more permeable Thames catchment the dependence recedes9\nmore gradually over a period of just over 10 days.10\n4.3 Bivariate temporal dependence11\nWhen estimating the probability of several locations experiencing extreme events at the same12\ntime, there is a need to define what simultaneous events are. For example, river flows are unlikely13\nto peak at exactly the same time in response to the same rainfall event, because of the different14\ncatchment characteristics. Therefore, the lagged extremal dependence measure P\n(\u03c4)\nj|i (p), given15\nby equation (3.6), was estimated for different pairs of gauging stations indexed by i and j for a16\nrange of lags, \u03c4 .17\nFigure 5 shows two examples of bivariate temporal dependence in river flows, between the18\nTweed at Kingledores and the Earn at Kinkell Bridge, and between the Thames at Kingston and19\nthe Lambourn at Shaw. For the first pair, the maximum extremal dependence occurs for a lag20\nof 0 days between the series. However, because of the very slow response of the Lambourn, there21\nis no well-defined maximum for the Thames-Lambourn pair. Instead the dependence increases22\nslowly up to a lag of about 18 days, after which it levels off. It is likely that the measured23\ndependence between the Thames-Lambourn pair reflects the shared seasonality between this24\npair. In particular the flow regime for the Lambourn at Shaw is dominated by seasonal behaviour.25\nThis suggests that for some very slowly responding catchments the assumption of stationarity26\nmay not be an acceptable assumption even taken for sub periods of a year. For our selected set27\nof gauges, 96% of the river flow gauge-pairs have estimates of extremal dependence that peak28\nwithin a lag of 3 days, i.e. |\u03c4max| \u2264 3. The station pairs that do not have peak dependence29\n15\nwithin 3 days are those for which at least one of the pair is a very slowly responding catchment.1\nThus we considered river flow events to be simultaneous only if they occur within 3 days of2\nan extreme observation at the conditioning gauge. Hence, we take L = 3 in the evaluation of3\nNi(p, d) for river flows. For precipitation we estimated N|i(p, d) for both L = 0 and L = 1. We4\nfound no noticeable difference for these maximum lags so we take L = 0 for the whole analyses.5\n4.4 Spatial dependence in precipitation6\nFigure 6 shows estimates of the spatial dependence measure Ni(p, 30) for a range of p, and7\nFigure 7 shows Ni(p, 60) for one of these values of p, with its associated 95% confidence interval.8\nThe median numbers of neighbours considered were 2 for d = 30 km and 11 for d = 60 km. The9\nreturn periods were calculated by taking k = 1 in expression (1.1), we estimated this measure for10\np equal to 0.975, 0.995, 0.999, 0.9995, 0.9999, 0.99995, 0.99999 and 0.999995 which correspond11\nto the T = 0.1, 0.5, 3, 5, 30, 55, 274 and 548 year return periods and for d = 30 and 60.12\nBoth Figures 6 and 7(b) show that spatial dependence is stronger in south-east GB than in the13\nmountainous north and west. This broadly agrees with the results of Dales and Reed (1989), who14\ninvestigated spatial dependence in annual maximum daily precipitation. The lower dependence15\nin the hilly areas may reflect that orographic precipitation varies spatially at the same scale16\nas the topography, and particularly across major topographical barriers. Svensson and Jones17\n(2002) investigated extremal dependence between pairs of rain-gauges. Using continuous series18\nof observed daily precipitation, they found that dependence breaks down across topographical19\nbarriers. The lack of topographic variation in the south and east of the country is likely to be20\nthe reason that dependence in heavy precipitation is stronger over a larger area.21\nFigure 6 shows that Ni(p, 30) decreases with increasing return period T for all T , correspond-22\ning to increasing p. This suggests that extreme precipitation is asymptotically independent over23\nsites within d = 30 km in the rain-gauge network. For T = 0.1 years Figure 6(a) shows Ni(p, d),24\nis between 0.4 and 0.6 for the bulk of GB. For T = 55 years, shown in Figure 6(c), the depen-25\ndence drops to about 0.2\u22120.4. The decrease in spatial dependence with increasing return period26\nseems reasonable because of the localised character of heavy events. Weak evidence for such a27\ndecrease in dependence was also found by Dales and Reed (1989), using only annual maxima28\ndata. However, Dales and Reed (1989) were not able to quantify this changing dependence or29\n16\nextrapolate it within their framework of annual maxima analysis.1\nComparing Ni(p, 30) and Ni(p, 60) for p corresponding to T = 55 years in Figures 6(c)2\nand 7(b), it can be seen that spatial dependence decreases with increasing d as expected. The3\nstrongest dependence occurs where Ni(p, 30) exceeds 0.4 at several locations in the south and4\neast. This means that if a gauge experiences heavy precipitation, more than 40% of gauge5\nlocations within 30 km also receive heavy precipitation. In the north and west Ni(p, 30) drops6\nto around 0.2. The corresponding values for Ni(p, 60) are 0.3 for the southeast and 0.1 for the7\nnorth-west. The spatial dependence also varies more smoothly across GB for larger d (as many8\ngauges will be the same in neighbouring sets) although the lower dependences in hilly areas9\nare still apparent. For this value of T (equivalently p) estimates of Ni(p, 90) and Ni(p, 120) are10\napproximately 0 for north-west GB, see Keef (2007).11\nThe 95% confidence intervals for Ni(p, 60), for T = 55 years, shown in Figures 7(a) and (c)12\nwere derived through block bootstrapping for the dependence estimates in Figure 7(b). The13\nwidths of the intervals are around 0.07, which suggests that the level of uncertainty is fairly14\nsmall. The widths increase with increasing return period, and for T = 548 years they are15\naround 0.12 (not shown). Unlike when extrapolating return levels the uncertainty in Ni(p, 60)16\ndoes not always increase with increasing T as Ni(p, 60) is an expected proportion which tends17\nto its lower bound of zero.18\n4.5 Spatial dependence in river flows19\nThe results of the spatial dependence analysis of large river flows are presented in Figures 8 and20\n9. To define return periods it is necessary to specify a value for k in expression (1.1). The results21\nin Sections 4.2 and 4.3 suggest that for many catchments k = 2 is realistic, but for some the22\nreturn periods stated will be too low. Using k = 2 we estimated N|i(p, d) for p equal to 0.975,23\n0.995, 0.999, 0.9995, 0.9999, and 0.99995 which correspond to the T = 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 50 and 10024\nyear return periods and for d = 30 and 60 km. The median numbers of neighbours considered25\nwere 3 for d = 30 km and 12 for d = 60 km.26\nOverall, the spatial dependences in river flows are stronger than for precipitation. This27\nmay be because river flow represents an areally averaged process, whereas the precipitation28\nobservations are made at a point and are therefore more vulnerable to small-scale variation,29\n17\nfor example from convection. Figure 8(c) shows the Ni(p, 30) for p corresponding to a 50 year1\nreturn period. A couple of locations have dependence estimates exceeding 0.7, with most of GB2\nexceeding 0.3. For comparison consider for precipitation Ni(p, 30) for T = 55 year, i.e. roughly3\nthe same return period, then Figure 6(c) showed that Ni(p, 30) exceeded 0.4 at several locations4\nand for the bulk of GB it exceeds 0.2.5\nThe pattern of stronger dependence in the south-east GB compared with the north and6\nwest, which was seen for the precipitation analysis, is barely hinted at in Figures 8 and 9(b). A7\nsouth-east to north-west pattern may be masked by the more pronounced local variation in the8\ndependence in river flows. For example, an area in the Thames catchment in southern England9\nstands out as having considerably lower dependence than the surrounding region. This shows up10\nparticularly clearly for T = 0.2 years and d = 30 km in Figure 8(a). In this area very permeable,11\nand sometimes also larger than average, catchments are located close to more impermeable12\ncatchments (Figure 1). The slower flow response of the permeable catchments compared with13\nthe less permeable ones means that spatial dependence in river flow decreases when both types14\nof catchments are found within \u2206i(d).15\nA couple of areas further north, in the Lake District and eastern Scotland, also have lower16\nlevels of dependence. This seems to be related to whether or not there are lakes and reservoirs in17\nthe catchments. The spatial dependence is particularly low for catchments that do not contain18\nlarge water-bodies (Calder at Calder Hall, Brathay at Jeffy Knotts, Dighty Water at Balmossie19\nMill, Lyon at Comrie Bridge, Almond at Almondbank and Dean Water at Cookston), when20\nthe surrounding catchments within 30 km of them do. The effect of lakes and reservoirs is to21\nattenuate the floods, so that the river levels rise and fall more slowly than they would otherwise22\ndo.23\nWhen there are several gauges on the same river within \u2206i(d), one would expect strong24\ndependence in that area. However, because different geologies and other characteristics of the25\ndifferent sub-catchments affect the river flow formation, the effect of nested catchments is not26\nespecially obvious in the plots. A set of gauges along a river that do show strong dependence27\ninclude the Dee at Woodend, the Dee at Park and the upstream tributary Girnock Burn at28\nLittlemill, located in north-eastern Scotland. In general, conditioning gauges with large catch-29\nments show stronger dependence estimates than do conditioning gauges with small catchments,30\n18\npresumably because the large catchments contain nested sub-catchments within \u2206i(d).1\nSimilar to the results for the precipitation analysis, the spatial pattern of dependence in2\nriver flooding across Britain becomes smoother with increasing d (Figures 8(a) and 9(b)). It3\nalso tends to decrease with increasing T (Figure 8). Since precipitation is a major driver for4\nriver flow formation, this is probably largely related to the spatial structure of precipitation5\nevents, with more extreme falls embedded within areas of less extreme precipitation depths.6\nHowever, it can be questioned whether flooding would ever occur, say, at a downstream gauge7\nin a catchment without high flows occuring also at several of the upstream gauges. The model is8\nfitted using records which are generally around 40 years in length, and extrapolation to higher9\nreturn periods is based on the behaviour of these relatively frequent events (where dependence10\ndecreases with T ). If there is indeed a change in the dependence structure for less frequent11\nevents longer records are needed for this to be picked up by the model.12\nFigures 9(a) and (c) show the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals derived13\nthrough block bootstrapping for the dependence estimates in Figure 9(b). The widths of the14\nintervals are around 0.09, which is slightly larger than for the precipitation for the same T , but15\nstill rather small. The width increases with increasing T , and for T = 100 years they are around16\n0.12 wide (not shown). There is more variation in the confidence intervals for river flows than17\nfor precipitation. The widths of the intervals do not seem to change with the magnitude of the18\ndependence estimates, but several widths exceed 0.2, particularly for the higher return periods.19\nThese larger confidence intervals seem to correspond to cases with a large amount of missing20\ndata for the conditioning gauge.21\n4.6 Factors affecting dependence in river flows22\nAs shown in Section 4.5 the areas of the country with diverse catchments appear to exhibit23\nlower spatial dependence of flooding. To investigate the effect of catchment characteristics24\non dependence (i.e. probability of widespread flooding) we carried out a correlation analysis25\nto determine whether catchments with similar characteristics had higher dependence and vice26\nversa. We looked for correlations between the absolute differences in catchment characteristics27\nbetween two flow gauges and the pairwise dependence between these flow gauges. The data used28\nin this study is a subset of the set used in the main study. In total, 36 conditioning gauges,29\n19\nand gauges within 60 km of these conditioning gauges, were used for a pair-wise dependence1\nanalysis.2\nThe catchment characteristics investigated include the catchment descriptors derived for the3\nFlood Estimation Handbook (FEH) (Bayliss, 1999). In addition, the distance between each pair4\nof gauges and the value of standard average annual rainfall at the conditioning gauge (CSAAR)5\nwere used. The latter was included as a proxy to see if the geographical variation in dependence6\nin precipitation, which is strong (weak) in the south-east (north-west) with predominantly low7\n(high) CSAAR values, is carried through to the dependence in flow.8\nTable 2 shows the Kendall\u2019s tau dependence measure between each of \u03c4max, P\n(\u03c4max)\nj|i (p) and9\nQ\n(L)\nj|i (p) with the differences in each of the catchment descriptors. For assessing \u03c4max, the dif-10\nferences in catchment descriptors were taken as the value for the non-conditioning gauge minus11\nthe value for the conditioning gauge, whereas for the other two analyses the absolute difference12\nof the descriptors was used. The descriptors that have a noticeable effect on \u03c4max include the13\ncatchment area, mean drainage path length, base flow index, standard percentage runoff, and14\nflood attenuation by reservoirs and lakes. The same catchment descriptors are found to be15\nof importance for both P\n(\u03c4max)\nj|i (p) and Q\n(L)\nj|i (p), although the relationships tend to be stronger16\nfor the former. This seems reasonable, since the P\n(\u03c4max)\nj|i (p) allows the maximum dependence17\nto be found among a larger number of different lags. All the descriptors except CSAAR have18\nnoticeable correlations with P\n(\u03c4max)\nj|i (p). However, two of the descriptors, the mean drainage19\npath length and the flood attenuation by reservoirs and lakes, do not have a noticeable effect20\non Q\n(L)\nj|i (p). The most influential differences for both dependence estimates are the differences21\nin mean drainage path length, proportion of time when the soil is wet, standard average annual22\nrainfall, base flow index, standard percentage runoff, and distance between the gauges.23\n5 Summary and concluding remarks24\nIn this paper we have presented a complete study of within-event dependence of extreme river25\nflows and precipitation over the whole of Great Britain. We have shown that it is possible to26\nquantify the level of extremal dependence for a large number of sites and hence derive measures27\nof spatial dependence over small and large spatial scales. The method that we have used in28\nthis paper is the first statistical method that is capable of producing reliable estimates of the29\n20\nprobabilities of multiple, simultaneous floods and spatially widespread extreme precipitation.1\nFor both precipitation and river flows, events become more localised in space as the return2\nperiods of these events increases. For precipitation, spatial dependence is weaker in the moun-3\ntainous north and west than in the rest of Great Britain, reflecting the effect of topographic4\nvariation. This effect is not obvious in the spatial dependence pattern for river flows, which5\nshows a more variable pattern at smaller scales. The local variability is related to differences6\nin catchment characteristics. In areas where characteristics are similar, spatial dependence is7\nstrong. However, where, for example, fast-responding impermeable catchments are located next8\nto slowly-responding permeable catchments, the spatial dependence in river flows is low.9\nIn this paper we ignore the seasonal features of the processes. However, Keef (2007) explored10\nthe seasonality of dependence in precipitation and found weaker spatial dependence in summer11\nthan winter. This may be attributed to the larger numbers of localised convective storms in12\nsummer than winter. In contrast, autumns and winters in Great Britain tend to be dominated13\nby spatially widespread precipitation of frontal origin. Because of the seasonal changes in pre-14\ncipitation, it seems likely that spatial dependence in river flows may also be weaker in summer15\nthan in winter. Another feature of flow data that we have not examined is the effect of non-16\nstationarity of very slowly responding catchments. The flows in these catchments are baseflow17\ndominated and are dominated by changes in groundwater rather than recent precipitation. For18\nthese catchments the duration of high flow periods can last for weeks rather than days. Because19\nthe high flows of these catchments are so different from the high flows of most catchments futher20\nwork is needed to ensure that the spatial aspects of flooding for these catchments are correctly21\nincluded in any analysis.22\nAcknowledgements23\nCK thanks NERC for funding her studentship at Lancaster University and CEH Wallingford,24\nreference number NER\/S\/A\/2003\/11343.
