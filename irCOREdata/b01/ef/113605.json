These barriers have the effect of re-\nducing the carrier range and long-range mobility. It has been\nproposed that the problem of maintaining the enhanced\ntransport properties present in the mesophase, at tempera-\ntures below the crystalline to mesophase transition, can be\nsolved by the use of reactive mesogens \u0001RMs\u0002. These are\ncomprised of liquid crystal molecules with reactive end\ngroups at the ends of the aliphatic chains. They form ther-\nmotropic mesophases and can be irreversibly photopolymer-\nized in the presence of an appropriate photoinitiator, forming\na stable network. It is expected that as the morphology is\nfrozen-in, the transport properties will be stabilized.2,3 The\nformation of an insoluble semiconducting film has the\nadvantage of simplifying the fabrication of multilayer de-\nvices using sequential solution-based application methods to\nadd further layers.3 In addition, RMs can be patterned using\noptical masks.\nInitial time-of-flight \u0001TOF\u0002 studies on a nonreactive ca-\nlamitic liquid crystal bis\u0001alkylphenyl\u0002-bithiophene \u0001PTTP\u0002\n\u0001Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0005 in the smectic phase \u0001SmG\u0002 showed ambipolar\ntransport \u0004see Fig. 2\u0002 with resulting hole mobility \u0001hole\n=0.044 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 and electron mobility \u0001electron\n=0.07 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001these are both dispersive and field de-\npendent, quoted here at 4\u0002104 V cm\u22121\u0002, indicating that this\nparticular calamitic core was a promising candidate for the\npreparation of an oxetane containing reactive mesogen.

The cross-linked regions maintained their\nbirefringent texture, while those that were not subject to ra-\ndiation underwent the transition to the isotropic phase. Direct\nconfirmation of the cross-linking reaction by infared spec-\ntroscopy was not possible as the sample was encased within\nthe glass liquid crystal cell.

This is in contrast to the cross-linked sample results\nshown in Fig. 4, where the electron photocurrent becomes\ndispersive. Any remaining photoinitiator appears to have a\ntrapping effect in the case of electrons, but not in the case of\nholes, whose behavior remains nondispersive \u0001Fig. 3\u0002. The\nphotoinitiator concentration, and its effects on the transport\nand cross-linking, are the subject of ongoing investigation.\nIn terms of carrier mobility, there is a small drop be-\ntween the nonreactive liquid crystal PTTP and the reactive\nmesogen PTTP-oxetane \u0001both for the cross linked and non-\npolymerized case\u0002. This is not due to the presence of the\nphotoinitiator, as the nonpolymerised PTTP-oxetane without\ninitiator yields mobilities in agreement with the cross-linked\nfilm results at the same temperature \u0001see Table I\u0002. There even\nappears to be some mobility improvement postcross-linking,\nalthough this could be due to sample to sample variation.\nThe higher mobility in the nonreactive liquid crystal, com-\npared to the RM, is probably due to the higher order smectic\nphase \u0001SmG\u0002 present in the former compared to the latter\n\u0001SmB\u0002. This relative drop between a liquid crystal and a\nrelated reactive mesogen is not surprising and has been pre-\nviously measured in a variety of systems,10,6 although in\nmany cases the drop is of a factor of 10.
