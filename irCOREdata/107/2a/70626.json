INTRODUCTION\nA similarity between electrons in monolayer graphene\nand relativistic massless particles has been broadly dis-\ncussed in the literature [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The combi-\nnation of a sublattice composition of electronic Bloch\nstates (treated as an \u201cisospin\u201d) in a single atomic sheet\nof graphite with a linear dispersion in the vicinity of cor-\nners of the Brillouin zone makes them chiral, like Dirac\nfermions. Experimentally, the chiral nature of charge\ncarriers has been deduced from a peculiar sequencing of\nplateaus in the quantum Hall effect [7, 8, 9, 10], while\nthe linear dispersion relation has been observed directly\nby angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES)\n[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. ARPES has al-\nready been used to provide information about the form\nof the dispersion curves, renormalization of spectra by\nelectron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and\ninformation about quasiparticle lifetimes in the mate-\nrial [11, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Here, we point out that\nconstant-energy angular maps of photoemission reflect\nthe chirality of electrons in graphene. For monolay-\ners, we show that the recently published ARPES data\nprovides evidence for the chirality of carriers in this\nmaterial. We demonstrate that the anisotropy of the\nconstant-energy maps may be used to extract informa-\ntion about the magnitude and sign of interlayer coupling\nparameters in bilayer graphene and about the types of\nsymmetry-breaking effects produced by the underlying\nsubstrate or doping. In particular, we demonstrate that\none can distinguish between two effects that may gener-\nate a gap in the bilayer spectrum: interlayer asymmetry\n[13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] and symmetry\nbreaking in the bottom layer resting on a SiC substrate\n[15, 16, 33].\n\u2217Present address: Department of Physics, University of Basel,\nKlingelbergstrasse 82, 4056 Basel, Switzerland\nWhereas the chirality of a relativistic particle is defined\nby its spin, chirality in graphene refers to the sublattice\ncomposition of plane-wave states of Bloch electrons. The\nhoneycomb lattice of monolayer graphene, Fig. 1(a), has\ntwo sites in the unit cell, labeled as A and B, and there\nis a degeneracy point at each of two inequivalent corners\nK\u00b1 = \u00b1(4pi\/3a, 0) of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, also\nreferred to as valleys, Fig. 1(b). Near the center of valley\nK+ in monolayer graphene, electrons are described by a\nDirac-like Hamiltonian,\nH\u02c61 \u2248 ~v\u03c3.q, (1)\nwhich determines the linear dispersion \u000f = ~vq of elec-\ntrons in the conduction band and \u000f = \u2212~vq in the va-\nlence band [1]. The eigenstates \u03a8, within a single valley,\nhave different amplitudes on adjacent A and B sites, and,\nfollowing the example of relativistic physics, they may\nbe written as a two-component \u201cspinor\u201d \u03a8 = (\u03c8A, \u03c8B).\nThe chirality of a relativistic particle is right-handed if\nits spin points in the same direction as its momentum,\nleft-handed if its spin points in the opposite direction.\nBy analogy, the relative phase \u03c6 between the wave func-\ntion on sublattice atoms indicates the \u2018isospin\u2019 vector\n\u03c3 = (cos\u03c6, sin\u03c6, 0) of the chiral state \u03a8 = (e\u2212i\u03c6\/2, ei\u03c6\/2)\nof quasiparticles in graphene. ARPES [34, 35] is exactly\nthe tool to visualize this state through the angular de-\npendence of the emitted photoelectron flux.\nThe proposed analysis is based upon the standard\ntheory of angle-resolved photoemission [34, 35]. In an\nARPES experiment, incident photons with energy ~\u03c9\nproduce photoelectrons whose intensity I is measured\nin a known direction as a function of kinetic energy\nEp \u2248 ~2(|p\u2016|2 + p2z)\/2m [34, 35]: ~\u03c9 = Ep + A \u2212 \u000fq\nwhere A is the work function and \u000fq is the energy of\nBloch electrons in graphene. Conservation of momen-\ntum ensures that the component of the momentum par-\nallel to the graphene surface ~p\u2016 = ~(px, py) is equal to\nthe quasi-momentum ~K\u00b1 + ~q of Bloch electrons near\nvalley K\u00b1:\np\u2016 = K\u00b1 + q+G , (2)\nar\nX\niv\n:0\n71\n1.\n11\n29\nv2\n  [\nco\nnd\n-m\nat.\nme\ns-h\nall\n]  \n29\n N\nov\n 20\n07\n2where a reciprocal lattice vector G = m1b1 + m2b2 is\nwritten in terms of primitive reciprocal lattice vectors\nb1 = (2pi\/a, 2pi\/\n\u221a\n3a), b2 = (2pi\/a,\u22122pi\/\n\u221a\n3a), and inte-\ngers m1, m2.\nAs graphene has two inequivalent atomic sites, the an-\ngular dependence of the intensity may be accounted for\nby considering two-source interference (a` la Young\u2019s dou-\nble slits). Outside the sample, at a position R0 rela-\ntive to the midpoint of the two sources, electronic waves\ne[ip.(R0+u\/2)\u2212i\u03c6\/2] and e[ip.(R0\u2212u\/2)+i\u03c6\/2] from adjacent\nA and B sites combine. This yields the intensity I of the\ntwo-source interference pattern,\nI \u223c cos2\n[\np\u2016.u\n2\n\u2212 \u03c6\n2\n]\n, (3)\nwhere u = (0, a\/\n\u221a\n3) is the separation of the adja-\ncent sites, and near each corner of the Brillouin zone\np\u2016.u \u2248 2pi(m1 \u2212m2)\/3. The first term in the argument\nof Eq. (3) is a phase difference due to the different path\nlengths of electron waves emitted from two sublattices,\nwhile the second term, \u2212\u03c6\/2, arises from the relative\nphase of the electronic Bloch states on A and B sublat-\ntices determined by the quasiparticle chirality.\nenergy chirality sublattice phase ARPES\n\u000fq \u03c3.n1 difference anisotropy\n+vq +1 \u03c6 = \u03d5 I \u223c cos2(\u03d5\/2)\n\u2212vq \u22121 \u03c6 = \u03d5+ pi I \u223c sin2(\u03d5\/2)\nTable 1: Manifestation of electronic chirality in the\nanisotropy of ARPES constant-energy maps in monolayer\ngraphene in the valley K+, where angle \u03d5 specifies the\ndirection measured from the center of the valley.\nElectrons in the conduction and valence bands at the\nvalleyK+, determined by the Dirac Hamiltonian, Eq.

Note that, the first term\nin the argument of Eq. (3), arising from the path dif-\nference of electron waves emitted from two sublattices,\naccounts for the relative rotation in the interference pat-\ntern around the six corners of the hexagonal Brillouin\nzone. Figure 1(c) shows a typical calculated dependence\nof the intensity of the photoemission from states (here,\nat energy 1.45eV below the charge-neutrality point [36])\nplotted as a function of wave vector p\u2016, in agreement\nwith the qualitative prediction of the two-source inter-\nference picture Eqs. (1,3), summarized in Table 1. The\nnumerical data, Fig. 1(c), appear to be consistent with\nexperimentally measured constant-energy maps [11].\nSo far, we have discussed the angular dependence of\nthe interference patterns, neglecting the effect of trig-\nonal warping. It leads to a triangular deformation of\niso-energetic lines in the band structure of graphene and\nFIG. 1: (a) schematic of the monolayer lattice containing two\nsites in the unit cell: A (white circles) and B (black).

Here we use parameter val-\nues \u03b30 = 3.0eV, s0 = 0.129, \u2206 = 0, and the energy width\n\u0393 = 0.24eV.\n\u000fq(\u2212q) 6= \u000fq(q) asymmetry of the electron dispersion\naround each valley which becomes more pronounced for\nstates further from the charge-neutrality point. Another\nperturbation of chiral particles in graphene may be asym-\nmetry \u2206 = \u000fA \u2212 \u000fB of on-site lattice energies \u000fA, \u000fB due\nto the presence of a substrate, leading to a gap \u2206 in the\n3spectrum at low energies. The presence of such asym-\nmetry in graphene grown epitaxially on SiC substrate,\nand the possibility of observing its effect within spec-\ntroscopic accuracy, has recently been discussed following\nexperimental ARPES measurements of the low-energy\nband structure [15, 16]. In Section II below, we show\nthat opening an AB asymmetry gap in the monolayer\nspectrum is accompanied by the loss of the chirality-\nrelated anisotropy of ARPES angular maps at low en-\nergies, which can be used as an additional test for the\nsymmetry-breaking effect induced by a SiC substrate.\nIn Section III we offer a detailed analysis of the angle-\ndependent maps of ARPES of bilayer graphene, which\nis the main goal of this work. First, we analyze angular\nphotoemission maps of an ideal \u201cpristine\u201d bilayer, taking\ninto account intricate details of its band structure using a\ntight-binding model that employs the Slonczewski-Weiss-\nMcClure parametrization of relevant couplings [2, 3]. In\nSections III A and III B, we show that angular maps can\nbe used to determine not only the magnitude, but also\nsigns of the interlayer coupling constants used in the\ntight-binding model. If measured experimentally, the lat-\nter information may also prove to be useful for general\nstudies of bulk graphite. In Section III C we analyze the\ninfluence of inter- and intra-layer symmetry breaking in\nbilayers, and we show that the effect of the interlayer\ncharge transfer upon doping can be, in principle, dis-\ntinguished from crystalline asymmetry induced by a SiC\nsubstrate.\nII. PHOTOEMISSION FROM MONOLAYER\nGRAPHENE\nTo produce a quantitative prediction of the photoe-\nmission intensity, we use Fermi\u2019s Golden Rule to cal-\nculate the probability of a photo-stimulated transition\nfrom an initial band state with 2D quasi-momentum\n~k = ~K\u00b1 + ~q and energy \u000fq in graphene to a con-\ntinuum state with momentum ~p and energy Ep in vac-\nuum [34]. The initial state wave function in graphene is\nwritten as a linear combination of Bloch wave functions\non the A and B sublattices with coefficients \u03c8A and \u03c8B ,\nrespectively:\n\u03a8k (r) =\n\u2211\nj=A,B\n\u03c8j (k)\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 1\u221a\nN\n\u2211\nRj\neik.Rj\u03a6 (r\u2212Rj)\n\uf8f9\uf8fb ,\nwhere RA, RB are the positions of A and B type atoms,\nand \u03a6(r) is a pz atomic orbital. Then, the intensity I\nof photoemission from states in a given band may be\nwritten as\nI \u223c |\u03a6p|2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u2211\nj\n\u03c8je\n\u2212iG.\u03c4j\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n\u03b4 (Ep +A\u2212 \u000fq \u2212 \u03c9) , (4)\nwhere \u03a6p =\n\u222b\ne\u2212ip.r\u03a6(r)d3r is the Fourier image of an\natomic orbital \u03a6 (r), and the wave vector component par-\nallel to the surface is conserved, q = p\u2016\u2212K\u00b1\u2212G, Eq. (2).\nThe summation with respect to index j = {A,B} takes\ninto account coefficients \u03c8A and \u03c8B located at atomic po-\nsitions defined by basis vectors \u03c4A and \u03c4B within a given\nunit cell. The Dirac delta function, containing the work\nfunction of graphene A, expresses energy conservation.\nNote that, in this paper, we do not model dynamical ef-\nfects that lead to energy broadening [11, 19, 20, 21, 22],\nbut introduce a Lorentzian \u03b4(. . .) \u2248 \u0393\/(pi[(. . . )2 + \u03932]) in\nthe figures with parameter \u0393 representing finite energy\nbroadening.\nA standard form [37, 38] of a tight-binding monolayer\nHamiltonian H\u02c61 and overlap-integral matrix S\u02c61 (that\ntakes into account non-orthogonality of orbitals on ad-\njacent atomic sites), H\u02c61\u03a8 = \u000fqS\u02c61\u03a8, is\nH\u02c61 =\n(\n\u2206\/2 \u2212\u03b30f (k)\n\u2212\u03b30f\u2217 (k) \u2212\u2206\/2\n)\n,\nS\u02c61 =\n(\n1 s0f (k)\ns0f\n\u2217 (k) 1\n)\n,\nf(k) = eikya\/\n\u221a\n3 + 2e\u2212ikya\/2\n\u221a\n3 cos(kxa\/2).\nHere, parameter \u03b30 describes the strength of nearest-\nneighbor hopping yielding the Fermi velocity v =(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b30\/~ [39], and a is the lattice constant. The pa-\nrameter s0 \u001c 1 describes non-orthogonality of orbitals,\n\u2206 = \u000fA \u2212 \u000fB describes a possible asymmetry between A\nand B sites (thus opening a gap |\u2206|). Note that here\nwe neglected next-nearest neighbor hops which do not\nproduce any visible change in the calculated spectra.\nFigure 1(c) shows constant-energy intensity patterns\n(\u201cmaps\u201d) at 1.45eV below the charge-neutrality point\n[36] in monolayer graphene, plotted as a function of pho-\ntoelectron wave vector p\u2016 = (px, py) parallel to the sur-\nface of graphene, covering the whole Brillouin zone. Since\nthe patterns in the vicinity of each Brillouin zone corner\nare the same, but rotated with respect to each other, we\ndescribe in detail what is happening around one Brillouin\nzone corner. Fig. 2(b) shows a series of plots demonstrat-\ning the evolution of the constant-energy map with energy\nfor the valley K+ = (4pi\/3a, 0). Each plot is for a dif-\nferent fixed energy from the charge-neutrality point with\nenergies above (below) on the left (right) hand side. For\nstates above the charge-neutrality point (left), the an-\ngular variation is cos2(\u03d5\/2) where \u03d5 is the angle of the\nmomentum measured from the center of the valley: com-\nparison with Eq. (3) yields \u03c6 \u2261 \u03d5, illustrating that the\nisospin is parallel to the momentum \u03c3.n1 = 1. Fig. 2(b)\n(right) shows the intensity for emission from states below\nthe charge-neutrality point in monolayer graphene. In\nthis case, the patterns are flipped with respect to those\nof the left and comparison with Eq. (3) yields \u03c6 = \u03d5+ pi\nindicating that the isospin is antiparallel to the momen-\ntum \u03c3.n1 = \u22121.\nFigure 2(c) shows the development of the fixed-energy\nintensity pattern as asymmetry of on-site lattice ener-\ngies \u2206 = \u000fA \u2212 \u000fB increases, opening a small gap in the\n4FIG. 2: (a) schematics of the low-energy bands \u000f = \u00b1~vq\nnear the K+ point in the absence of intralayer asymme-\ntry \u2206. (b) The intensity of photoemission from states at\na fixed energy close to the charge-neutrality point in mono-\nlayer graphene, plotted as a function of photoelectron wave\nvector q\u2016 = (qx, qy) parallel to the surface of graphene in the\nvicinity of valley p\u2016 = (4pi\/3a, 0). Each plot corresponds to\na different energy with respect to the charge-neutrality point,\neither above (left hand side) or below (right). Parameter val-\nues are \u03b30 = 3.0eV, s0 = 0.129, \u2206 = 0, and the energy\nwidth \u0393 varies as the energy divided by six. (c) The develop-\nment of the intensity pattern for emission at a fixed energy\n0.1eV below the charge-neutrality point in the vicinity of val-\nley p\u2016 = (4pi\/3a, 0) in monolayer graphene as intralayer asym-\nmetry increases in magnitude \u2206\/2 = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1eV. Pa-\nrameter values are \u03b30 = 3.0eV, s0 = 0.129, and the Lorentzian\nenergy broadening \u0393 = 0.0167.\nspectrum. There are two principle effects on the ARPES\nspectrum. For energy gaps |\u2206|\/2 \u001c |\u000f|, the mixing of\nthe wave functions between A and B sites destroys the\nperfect cancellation of the ARPES intensity, so that the\nratio between the maximum and minimum intensity be-\ncomes finite [Fig. 2(c), left image]. As the gap increases\ntowards the energy probed, the ARPES contour becomes\nsmaller and the intensity anisotropy vanishes [Fig. 2(c),\nmiddle and right]. Thus, the opening of an AB asymme-\ntry gap in the monolayer spectrum is accompanied by the\nloss of the chirality-related anisotropy of ARPES angular\nmaps at low energies, which can be used not only as a\nstrong test for the symmetry-breaking effect induced by\na SiC substrate [15], but also as a probe of wave function\nmixing by AB asymmetry or trigonal warping. Unlike\nAB asymmetry, whose effects on the ARPES intensity\nare strongest near the charge-neutrality point, trigonal\nwarping affects the ARPES spectral intensity only at very\nlarge energies.\nFor finite \u2206, an analytical, approximate description\nof the ARPES intensity can be developed as follows.\nFor electronic energies much less than the pi-band width\n(qa\u001c 1),\nf(k) \u2248 \u2212\n\u221a\n3a\n2\n(qx \u2212 iqy) + a\n2\n8\n(qx + iqy)2, (5)\nand\nH\u02c61 \u2248\n(\n\u2206\/2 vpi\u2020 \u2212 \u00b5(pi)2\nvpi \u2212 \u00b5(pi\u2020)2 \u2212\u2206\/2\n)\n; pi = ~qx + i~qy,\nwhere \u00b5 = \u03b30a2\/8~2 describes the strength of trigonal\nwarping (we assume that \u00b5~q \u001c v).

The use of ARPES to determine the sign of\ninterlayer coupling parameter \u03b31\nBilayer graphene [10, 13, 23] consists of two coupled\nhexagonal lattices with inequivalent sites A1, B1 and\nA2, B2 in the first and second graphene sheets, respec-\ntively, arranged according to Bernal (A2-B1) stacking\n[23] as shown in Fig. 3(a). As in the monolayer, the Bril-\nlouin zone has two inequivalent degeneracy points K\u00b1\nwhich determine two valleys centered around zero en-\nergy in the electron spectrum. Near the center of each\n5valley the electron spectrum consists of four branches,\nFig. 3(b), with two branches describing states on sublat-\ntices A2 and B1 that are split from zero energy by about\n\u00b1|\u03b31|, determined by the interlayer coupling \u03b31, whereas\ntwo low-energy branches are formed by states based upon\nsublattices A1 and B2.\nTo model bilayer graphene we use a tight-binding\nHamiltonian matrix H\u02c62 and overlap-integral matrix\nS\u02c62 that operate in the space of coefficients \u03c8T =\n(\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1) at valley K+ [23, 24, 41]:\nH\u02c62 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u000fA1 \u03b33f\n\u2217 (k) \u03b34f (k) \u2212\u03b30f (k)\n\u03b33f (k) \u000fB2 \u2212\u03b30f\u2217 (k) \u03b34f\u2217 (k)\n\u03b34f\n\u2217 (k) \u2212\u03b30f (k) \u000fA2 \u03b31\n\u2212\u03b30f\u2217 (k) \u03b34f (k) \u03b31 \u000fB1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8,\nS\u02c62 =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 s0f (k)\n0 1 s0f\u2217 (k) 0\n0 s0f (k) 1 s1\ns0f\n\u2217 (k) 0 s1 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8. (8)\nWe adopt the notation of the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure\nmodel [2, 3] that is often used to describe bulk graphite,\nin order to parameterize the couplings relevant to bilayer\ngraphene [39]. Nearest-neighbor coupling within each\nplane is parameterized by coupling \u03b30 [v =\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b30\/~]\nand interlayer A2-B1 coupling is described by \u03b31. The\nparameter \u03b33 describes direct A1-B2 interlayer coupling\nwhich leads to an effective velocity v3 =\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b33\/~\nrepresenting the magnitude of trigonal warping, partic-\nularly relevant at low energy [we assume that ~vq \u001d\n\u03b31(v3\/v)]. Parameter \u03b34 describes A1-A2 and B1-B2\ninterlayer hopping. Using \u03b34 = 0.044eV [38, 42] we\nfound no noticeable effect of \u03b34 on the ARPES plots,\nand, for simplicity, we use \u03b34 = 0 throughout. Other\nweaker tunneling processes including next-nearest neigh-\nbor hopping are also neglected. The parameter s1 de-\nscribes non-orthogonality terms arising from overlaps be-\ntween orbitals on different layers. Following numerical\nanalysis, we found it also has no noticeable effect on the\nARPES plots [42]. In the following angular maps we use\ns1 = 0. We note that some works on bilayer graphene\nuse different definitions of the tight-binding parameters\n(for example, \u03b33 is defined with an additional minus sign\nin [23, 29, 31], but it has no effect on their conclusions).\nThe Bloch function amplitudes \u03c8T =\n(\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1) and band energy \u000fq, found\nusing the Hamiltonian Eq. (8), can be used to model\nthe photoemission intensity. Figure 3(c) shows constant-\nenergy maps at 1.45eV below the charge-neutrality point\n[36] in bilayer graphene, with the plot on the left hand\nside showing values of p\u2016 covering the whole Brillouin\nzone. The patterns in each valley are the same, but\nrotated with respect to the others, so that we can focus\non one of them, highlighted in Fig 3(c). The anisotropy\nof the bilayer pattern at this energy is similar to that\nof the monolayer, Fig. 1(c), because the energetic width\n\u0393 \u223c |\u03b31| obscures features associated with the presence\nFIG. 3: (a) schematic of the bilayer lattice containing four\nsites in the unit cell: A1 (white circles) and B1 (black) in\nthe bottom layer, and A2 (white) and B2 (black) in the top\nlayer.

To observe differences between the two\nmaterials, we need to consider the ARPES patterns at\nenergies closer to the charge-neutrality point.\nFigure 4 illustrates the evolution of the intensity pat-\ntern with energy. At energies greater than the interlayer\ncoupling, |\u000fq| > |\u03b31| (the top two patterns), there are\ntwo ring-like patterns, each corresponding to photoemis-\nsion from states in two bands, whereas, for low-energies,\n|\u000fq| < |\u03b31| (the bottom two patterns), there is a single\nring corresponding to emission from the degenerate band\nonly. Although these plots have been obtained using a\ncomplete bilayer Hamiltonian Eq. (8), it is convenient\nto discuss salient features of the results in Fig. 4 using\nan analytic formula, obtained by performing a linear-\n6FIG. 4: The intensity of photoemission from states at a\nfixed energy close to the charge-neutrality point in bilayer\ngraphene, plotted as a function of photoelectron wave vector\nq = (qx, qy) parallel to the surface of graphene in the vicin-\nity of valley p\u2016 = (4pi\/3a, 0). Each plot corresponds to a\ndifferent energy with respect to the charge-neutrality point,\neither above (left) or below (right). Parameter values are\n\u03b30 = 3.0eV, \u03b31 = \u22120.35eV, \u03b33 = \u22120.15eV, \u03b34 = 0.0eV,\ns0 = 0.129, \u2206 = U = 0, and the energy width \u0393 varies as\nthe energy divided by six.\nin-momentum expansion of f(k), Eq. (5), and neglect-\ning trigonal warping due to A1-B2 interlayer coupling\n(\u03b33 = 0), A1-A2 and B1-B2 interlayer coupling (\u03b34 = 0),\nand non-orthogonality of orbitals (s1 = s0 = 0). In this\ncase, the four bands in the bilayer spectrum are described\nby\n\u000fq \u2248 s 12 |\u03b31|\n[\u221a\n1 + 4~2v2q2\/\u03b321 + b\n]\n, (9)\nwhere the parameters\nb = \u00b11 ; s = \u00b11 ,\nidentify the four bands: b = 1 for the split bands with\nenergy |\u000fq| \u2265 |\u03b31| and b = \u22121 for the low-energy \u2018de-\ngenerate\u2019 bands that touch at zero energy, while s = 1\n(s = \u22121) indicates the conduction (valence) bands.\nThen, the contribution of a given band is\nI\u223c |\u03a6p|\n2g(\u03d5)\n[1 + (\u000fq\/~vq)2]\n\u03b4 (Ep +A\u2212 \u000fq \u2212 ~\u03c9) \u03b4q,p\u2016\u2212K\u00b1\u2212G,\nwhere\ng(\u03d5) = 12\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223e\u2212i\u03d5 + \u03b1ei\u03d5 + \u000fq~vq (\u03b1+ 1)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 , (10)\n= 1 + \u03b1 cos(2\u03d5) + \u03b4\u03b1,1\n[\n4\u000fq\n~vq\ncos(\u03d5) + 2\n(\n\u000fq\n~vq\n)2]\n,\nand\n\u03b1 = sb\u03b31\/|\u03b31|. (11)\nAs the value of \u03b1, Eq. (11), depends on the sign of the\ntight-binding parameter \u03b31, comparison of the angular\ndependence of g(\u03d5) with experimental data provides a\nmethod to determine the sign of \u03b31 [39]. To demon-\nstrate this, we make a comparison with our numerical\ndata, plotted in Fig. 4. In this illustration, we assume\nthat \u03b31 < 0, which is a natural choice given the z \u2192 \u2212z\nasymmetry of the pz orbitals of carbon. It shows how,\nfor this choice of the sign of \u03b31, the anisotropy of pho-\ntoemission angular-maps differ in the split bands and de-\ngenerate bands at energies above \u000f > 0 and below \u000f < 0\nthe charge neutrality point. Note that changing the sign\nof \u03b31 to positive would lead to an interchange of plots\nillustrating the ARPES behavior at \u000f > 0 and \u000f < 0.\nThe most pronounced feature of the ARPES angular\nmaps, depicted for \u03b31 < 0 in Fig. 4, is that, for en-\nergies \u000f > 0 (left side of Fig. 4), photoemission spec-\ntra are dominated by states in the degenerate bands,\nb = \u22121, which are nicely described by the intensity profile\nI \u221d cos2 \u03d5\/2. In contrast, for \u000f < 0 (valence bands, right\nside of Fig. 4), ARPES intensity from the degenerate\nband b = \u22121 is weak, whereas the split band, at energies\n\u000f < \u2212|\u03b31|, produces a bright, dominant signal. If ob-\nserved experimentally, such a behavior of ARPES maps\nin the conduction and valence bands would be indicative\nof a negative sign of the interlayer coupling \u03b31 [39]. If\nthe experimentally-observed constant-energy maps were\ninterchanged for negative and positive energies, it would\nbe evidence for \u03b31 > 0. Although the sign of \u03b31 has di-\nrectly observable consequences for the ARPES pattern,\ntight-binding parameters for graphite published so far\nhave assumed \u03b31 > 0 ([43] and references therein).\n7B. Electron chirality in the ARPES of bilayer\ngraphene and the use of trigonal warping to\ndetermine the interlayer coupling parameter \u03b33\nThe behavior of low-energy particles in bilayer\ngraphene is perhaps even more remarkable [10, 13, 23]\nthan in a monolayer. The low-energy bands (at energy\n|\u000f| \u001c |\u03b31|) have a parabolic energy-versus-momentum re-\nlation and they support eigenstates of an operator \u03c3.n2\nwith \u03c3.n2 = 1 for electrons in the conduction band and\n\u03c3.n2 = \u22121 for electrons in the valence band, where\nn2(q) = (cos(2\u03d5), sin(2\u03d5)), which means that they are\nchiral, but with a degree of chirality different from that\nin the monolayer, with the isospin linked to, but turn-\ning twice as quickly as, the direction of momentum. An\ninterpretation of the ARPES constant-energy maps in\nterms of two-source interference Eq. (3) predicts an an-\ngular variation like cos2(\u03d5) for states above the charge-\nneutrality point and cos2(\u03d5 + pi\/2) for states below (for\n\u03b31 < 0).\nFigure 5 shows the calculated intensity of the photoe-\nmission in the vicinity of valley p\u2016 = (4pi\/3a, 0) from\nstates very close to the charge-neutrality point in bi-\nlayer graphene, at energy 0.03eV above (left-hand side)\nand 0.03eV below (right). We consider two different\nsigns of the A2-B1 interlayer coupling strength, \u03b31, with\n\u03b31 = \u22120.35eV (top) and \u03b31 = +0.35eV (bottom). For\n\u03b31 < 0 and emission from the valence band (top right),\nthe pattern is like cos2(\u03d5 + pi\/2) as expected for two-\nsource interference of chiral electron in bilayer graphene.\nAs shown in Eq. (10) [and explained in detail in Sec-\ntion IV], the intensity from this band is not affected by\ncorrections due to the presence of dimer A2 \u2212 B1 or-\nbitals (it has \u03b1 = \u22121). For emission from the conduction\nband (top left side of Fig. 5), the interference pattern has\ntwo peaks, but one of the peaks has about three times\nstronger maximum intensity than the other because of\nthe presence of the contribution from dimer A2\u2212B1 or-\nbitals (this band has \u03b1 = +1) [44]. The bottom-left and\nbottom-right plots in Fig. 5 show the constant-energy\nmaps for \u03b31 > 0 for emission above and below the charge-\nneutrality point, respectively. In this case, the intensity\npattern for emission from the conduction band (bottom\nleft) has two peaks with the same maximum intensity,\narising from the interference of waves from the A1 and\nB2 sublattices. For emission from the valence band (bot-\ntom right) the peaks have different maximum intensities,\nowing to the interference of waves from four sublattices.\nWe note that, once the sign of \u03b31 is known, the sign of\nA1-B2 interlayer coupling \u03b33 may also be deduced from\nthe orientation of trigonal warping of the intensity pat-\nterns near the charge-neutrality point [39]. In bilayer\ngraphene, there are two principle causes of trigonal warp-\ning. The first is the presence of A1-B2 interlayer coupling\n\u03b33 that will tend to dominate at low energy, the sec-\nond is higher-in-momentum terms in the function f(k)\nthat will be important at large energy. The latter causes\ntrigonal warping in monolayer graphene while the former\nFIG. 5: The intensity of photoemission in bilayer graphene\nfor fixed energy very close to the charge-neutrality point in\nthe vicinity of valley p\u2016 = (4pi\/3a, 0): for states with en-\nergy 0.03eV above the charge-neutrality point (left) and states\nwith energy 0.03eV below the charge-neutrality point (right).\nWe consider different signs of the A2-B1 interlayer coupling\nstrength, \u03b31, with \u03b31 = \u22120.35eV (top) and \u03b31 = +0.35eV\n(bottom).

At large energies, when\nthe higher-in-momentum terms dominate, the orientation\nof trigonal warping is the same in bilayer graphene [e.g.\nFig. 3(c)] as in a monolayer [e.g. Fig. 1(c)] whereas, at\nlow energy, the orientation of trigonal warping in a bi-\nlayer depends on the sign of parameter \u03b33 (assuming that\nthe sign of \u03b31 is known).\nThe orientation of trigonal warping flips on changing\nthe sign of \u03b31 as seen by comparing the top and bottom\nplots in Fig. 5. At very low energy, \u000fq, ~vq \u001c \u03b31, and in\nthe absence of lattice asymmetry, the energy eigenvalues\n[23] are\n\u000fq \u2248 \u00b1\n\u221a\n~2v23q2 \u2212 2\u03be\nv3v2~3q3\n\u03b31\ncos 3\u03d5+\n~4v4q4\n\u03b321\n, (12)\nwhere v3 = \u2212\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b33\/~.

In this\npaper we usually choose \u03b31 < 0 and \u03b33 < 0 to illustrate\nthe possibility that the orientation of trigonal warping is\ndifferent at lower energies [e.g. Fig. 5 (top)] than that at\nhigher energies.\nC. Substrate-induced asymmetry in bilayer\ngraphene\nThe Hamiltonian H\u02c62, Eq. (8), takes into account the\npossibility of different on-site energies through its diag-\nonal components. Their effect may be understood by\nconsidering the eigenenergies exactly at the center of the\nvalley where f(k) = 0, namely \u000f = \u000fA1, \u000f = \u000fB2, or\n\u000f = 12 (\u000fA2 + \u000fB1)\u00b1\n\u221a\n1\n4 (\u000fA2 \u2212 \u000fB1)2 + \u03b321 .\nBelow, we distinguish between two types of asymmetry\nin bilayer graphene parameterized using \u2206 = \u000fA1 \u2212 \u000fB1\nthe difference between on-site energies of adjacent atoms\nin the bottom layer due to the presence of a substrate,\nand interlayer asymmetry U = [(\u000fA1 + \u000fB1) \u2212 (\u000fA2 +\n\u000fB2)]\/2 between on-site energies in the two layers arising\nfrom a doping effect and charge transfer to the substrate\n[13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].\nIn Fig. 6 (center), the band structure in the vicinity\nof the K point is plotted in the presence of substrate-\ninduced asymmetry \u2206 = \u000fA1\u2212 \u000fB1 [the plot is shown for\n\u03b31 < 0 and \u2206 < 0]. This type of asymmetry introduces\na gap \u223c |\u2206|\/2 as well as electron-hole asymmetry. In\nFig. 6 (right), the band structure in the vicinity of the K\npoint is plotted in the presence of interlayer asymmetry\nU = [(\u000fA1 + \u000fB1) \u2212 (\u000fA2 + \u000fB2)]\/2. It does not break\nelectron-hole symmetry, but introduces a gap \u223c |U |.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 7, the constant energy maps are\nsensitive both to the magnitude and sign of the asymme-\ntry \u2206.

As for the monolayer, one\neffect of asymmetry \u2206 is to impair the two-source inter-\nference resulting in a weakening of the angular anisotropy\nof the intensity pattern. The \u2018Mexican hat\u2019 structure of\nthe valence band for negative \u2206, and the conduction band\nfor positive \u2206, is manifested in the larger ARPES con-\ntour for emission from these states (shown on the mid-\ndle right and the bottom left, respectively) as opposed\nto their counterparts in the other band (middle left and\nthe bottom right, respectively). Experimentally, such a\ndifference in the size and nature of the ARPES contour\nfor emission from conduction or valence bands (at the\nsame distance from the midgap energy) would indicate\nthe presence and sign of intralayer asymmetry \u2206.\nSince interlayer asymmetry U results in a gap \u223c |U |\nthat preserves electron-hole symmetry and does not de-\npend on the sign of U , the constant-energy photoemission\nmaps are sensitive to the magnitude of U but not its sign.\nFigure 8 shows constant energy maps for photoemission\nfrom conduction band states at energy 0.1eV above the\ncharge-neutrality point (left hand side) and from valence\nband states at energy 0.1eV below the charge-neutrality\n9FIG. 8: The development of the intensity pattern in bilayer\ngraphene in the vicinity of valley p\u2016 = (4pi\/3a, 0) as inter-\nlayer asymmetry U\/2 = 0, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15eV increases,\nfor emission from states with energy 0.1eV above the charge-\nneutrality point on the left hand side, and energy 0.1eV below\nthe charge-neutrality point on the right.

DISCUSSION\nOur numerical data for bilayer graphene, Figs. 4,5,\nshow that the anisotropy of photoemission angular-maps\ndiffer in the split bands and degenerate bands at energies\nabove \u000f > 0 (left side of Fig. 4) and below \u000f < 0 (right\nside of Fig. 4) the charge neutrality point. These plots\nmay be interpreted in terms of the interference of photo-\nelectron waves emitted from four non-equivalent sublat-\ntices. In fact, for two of the four bands, the parameter\n\u03b1 = \u22121 in Eq. (10), so that the contribution of orbitals\non the \u2018dimer\u2019 sites A2 and B1 cancel, leaving only the\ncontribution of two terms e\u00b1i\u03d5 in g(\u03d5) that arise from\norbitals on sites A1 and B2. For the other two bands,\n\u03b1 = 1, the contribution of orbitals on the \u2018dimer\u2019 sites\nA2 and B1 to g(\u03d5) do not cancel, but interfere with the\ncontribution of orbitals on sites A1 and B2, producing a\ndifferent angular dependence and greater peak intensity\nthan for \u03b1 = \u22121.\nAs the value of \u03b1, Eq. (11), depends on the sign of \u03b31,\ncomparison of the angular dependence of g(\u03d5) with ex-\nperimental data provides a method to determine the sign\nof \u03b31 [39]. To demonstrate this, we make a comparison\nwith our numerical data, plotted in Fig. 4. For the sign\nof \u03b31 that we adopt in the numerics (\u03b31 < 0), the split\nband above the charge-neutrality point has \u03b1 = \u22121 so\nthe intensity from this band appears as a very faint ring\n(that of smaller radius) in the plot at energy \u000f = +0.5eV\nin Fig. 4. The degenerate band at this energy, however,\nhas \u03b1 = 1 so the intensity from it appears as the ring of\nlarger radius with larger peak intensity. As the energy\ndrops below |\u03b31|, left side of Fig. 4, the contribution of\nthe split band disappears to leave only the ring arising\nfrom the degenerate band with \u03b1 = 1. The energy has to\napproach the charge-neutrality point before the contribu-\ntion of the dimer sites A2 and B1, small in the parameter\n\u000fq\/~vq \u2248\n\u221a\n\u000fq\/\u03b31, weakens to reveal an anisotropy pat-\ntern characteristic of two source interference in bilayer\ngraphene, as explained in Section III B [44].\nThe picture is quite different for energies below the\ncharge-neutrality point (right side of Fig. 4). In this case\nthe split band has \u03b1 = 1 so that the intensity from it\nappears as the ring (of smaller radius) with larger peak\nintensity at energy \u000f = \u22120.5eV in Fig. 4. The degenerate\nband has \u03b1 = \u22121 so the intensity from it appears as the\nfainter ring (that of larger radius) at energy \u000f = \u22120.5eV.\nAs the energy increases above \u2212|\u03b31|, right side of Fig. 4,\nthe contribution of the split band disappears to leave only\nthe ring arising from degenerate band with \u03b1 = \u22121. This\nis why the intensity pattern \u223c cos2(\u03d5) is much easier to\ndetect below the charge-neutrality point than above it.\nIn fact, whether it is easily visible above or below the\ncharge-neutrality point depends on the sign of \u03b31 (here\nwe chose \u03b31 < 0) so the experimental observation of the\n10\nFIG. 9: The development of the intensity pattern in bilayer\ngraphene for emission from states with energy 0.1eV below\nthe charge-neutrality point in the vicinity of valley p\u2016 =\n(4pi\/3a, 0) as attenuation [described by factor exp(\u22122z+ 2i\u03b2)\nwhere (z, \u03b2) are real parameters] of waves from the bot-\ntom layer, increases. Parameter values are \u03b30 = 3.0eV,\n\u03b31 = \u22120.35eV, \u03b33 = \u22120.15eV, \u03b34 = 0.0eV, s0 = 0.129,\n\u0393 = 0.0167eV.\nanisotropy \u223c cos2(\u03d5) will provide a way to determine the\nsign of A2-B1 interlayer coupling \u03b31 in bilayer graphene.\nFinally, we note that the anisotropy of the constant-\nenergy maps may be influenced by other factors not mod-\neled here. For example, when the component of photo-\nelectron momentum perpendicular to the bilayer sample\npz is large, we expect that photoelectron waves emitted\nfrom the bottom layer will be attenuated with respect to\nthose emitted from the top layer. To obtain an impres-\nsion of the typical kind of effect, we introduced an expo-\nnential attenuation [described by factor exp(\u22122z + 2i\u03b2)\nwhere (z, \u03b2) are real parameters] of waves from the bot-\ntom layer. As shown in Fig. 9 for photoemission from\nstates at energy 0.1eV below the charge-neutrality point\nin bilayer graphene, the attenuation results in a destruc-\ntion of the double-peaked intensity pattern and the phase\nfactor \u03b2 has the effect of rotating the whole pattern.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nUsing Fermi\u2019s Golden Rule, we modeled the anisotropy\nof the intensity of photoemission constant-energy maps\nat low energy in graphene and demonstrated that the\nanisotropy is a manifestation of electronic chirality. In\nmonolayer graphene, photoemission may be viewed as a\ntwo-source interference experiment, a` la Young\u2019s double\nslits, the sources being two inequivalent lattice sites in\nthe unit cell. The resulting intensity \u223c cos2(\u03d5\/2) dis-\nplays a single-peaked dependence on the direction of mo-\nmentum described by angle \u03d5. In bilayer graphene, the\ninterference of emitted photoelectron waves from four\natomic sites produces single- or double-peaked constant-\nenergy maps, depending on the energy of the initial\nstate in graphene. The marked contrast between the\nanisotropy for emission from the conduction or the va-\nlence band at energies below the A2-B1 interlayer cou-\npling strength, parameterized by \u03b31 [39], provides an ex-\nperimental method to determine the magnitude and sign\nof parameter \u03b31.\nThe shape of the photoemission constant-energy maps\nis determined by the trigonal warping effect in graphene.\nIn monolayers and bilayers, the iso-energetic line changes\nfrom an almost-circular to a triangularly-warped shape\nas the energy increases: the extent of such warping is\ncontrolled by the dimensionless parameter qa, where q is\nthe magnitude of the wave vector measured from the cen-\nter of the valley and a is the lattice constant. In bilayer\ngraphene, strong trigonal warping may also occur at low\nenergy because of A1-B2 interlayer coupling, parameter-\nized by \u03b33 [39], and the observation of this latter trigonal\nwarping provides an experimental method to determine\nthe magnitude and sign of parameter \u03b33.\nMeasurement of the anisotropy of the intensity of pho-\ntoemission constant-energy maps provides a method to\ncharacterize realistic graphene samples. As an exam-\nple, we take into account substrate-induced asymme-\ntry that impairs the two-source interference in mono-\nlayer graphene, resulting in a weakening of the angular\nanisotropy of the intensity pattern. Analysis of recent\nexperimental data [15, 16] in terms of the anisotropy of\nconstant-energy maps may help to shed light on the pos-\nsible presence of asymmetry in graphene grown epitaxi-\nally on SiC substrate. In bilayers, both substrate-induced\nasymmetry and interlayer asymmetry alter the interfer-\nence pattern: we describe measurable differences between\nthem. This illustrates the potential of photoemission in\nthe future characterization of few-layer graphene sam-\nples.\nVI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank B.L. Altshuler, T. Ando, F. Guinea,\nand A.

The reason is that corrections due to the pres-\nence of dimer orbitals are small (in parameter \u000fq\/~vq),\nbut finite (this band has \u03b1 = +1). Their influence\nmay be estimated by considering the function g(\u03d5) =\n1 + cos(2\u03d5) + 4(\u000fq\/~vq) cos(\u03d5) + 2(\u000fq\/~vq)2, Eq.
