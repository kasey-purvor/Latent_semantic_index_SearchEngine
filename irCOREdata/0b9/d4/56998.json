Vascular plants and microfaunas \nrespond to this gradient by forming distinctive floral and faunal zones that reflect \nsub-environments along the gradient. This characteristic pattern of zonation can be used to \nestimate former relative sea level (RSL) by establishing the environmental origin of organic \nsediment preserved in estuaries, salt marshes and coastal lowlands (e.g. Shennan, 1992). RSL \nis reconstructed using sea-level indicators, which are physical, biological or chemical features \npossessing a systematic and quantifiable relationship to elevation in the tidal frame (Shennan, \n1986, van de Plassche, 1986). The indicative meaning (Figure 1d) is the elevational range \noccupied by a sea-level indicator (indicative range) in relation to a contemporaneous tide level \n(reference water level). \n \nAssemblages of salt-marsh foraminifera are widely used sea-level indicators that can accurately \ndefine zones within tidal environments with a precision of up to \u00b1 0.05 m in high marsh settings \n(Scott and Medioli, 1978; Gehrels, 1994, 2000; Horton and Edwards, 2006). Foraminifera are \nfrequently well preserved in salt-marsh deposits and their low diversity, high abundance \nassemblages (Sen Gupta, 1999; Gehrels, 2007) lend themselves to quantitative analysis. There \nare, however, potential difficulties with the application of salt-marsh foraminifera to reconstruct \nRSL. Interpretation of foraminiferal assemblages in subsurface sediments requires an \nunderstanding of the distribution and ecological preferences of modern foraminifera, including \ninfaunal habitation (e.g. Goldstein and Harben, 1993; Ozarko et al., 1997; Saffert and Thomas, \n1998), seasonal population fluctuations (e.g. Murray and Alve, 2000) and micro-scale variability \n(patchiness) in the distribution of foraminifera (e.g. Hippensteel et al., 2000). Post-depositional \n 4\nmodification of assemblages may also compromise paleoenvironmental reconstructions through \nselective removal of tests (e.g. Jonasson and Patterson, 1992; Goldstein and Watkins, 1999). \n \nPotential alternative means to reconstruct RSL from salt-marsh sediments include the stable \ncarbon isotopic composition (13C:12C ratio, expressed as \u03b413C in parts per mil (\u2030) compared to a \nstandard reference sample, PDB) and the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen (C:N) in \nbulk-organic sediments (e.g. Wilson et al., 2005; Lamb et al., 2006, 2007). Salt-marsh plants \nusing the C4 photosynthetic pathway, create plant tissues with an average \u03b413C composition of -\n12 \u2030 (Schlesinger, 1997) and a range from -17 \u2030 to -9 \u2030 (Chmura and Aharon, 1995). In \ncontrast, plants utilizing the C3 photosynthetic pathway have a \u03b413C signature of -34 \u2030 to -23 \u2030 \n(Chmura and Aharon, 1995). The distinction between these pathways offers a potential means \nto reconstruct RSL by identifying salt-marsh environments in organic sedimentary sequences \n(Chmura et al., 1987). Reconstructions with increased precision are possible if salt-marsh zones \n(low and high marshes characterized by different proportions of C3 and C4 plants) can be \nrecognized (Edwards, 2007). Such an approach requires locations where C3 and C4 plants have \nexisted together with differing distributions for the period under consideration (Wilson et al., \n2005) and \u03b413C is incorporated into organic sediments with little diagenetic change (e.g. Ember \net al., 1987; Fogel et al., 1989, Goni and Thomas, 2000). Measured values of \u03b413C and C:N \nrecord the balance between autochthonous and allochthonous inputs. The dominant \nautochthonous component in salt marshes is from vascular plants (Lamb et al., 2006), whilst \nallochthonous sediment may be derived from fresh, brackish or marine environments as \nparticulate or dissolved material. The contribution of allochthonous inputs (volume and \nprovenance, relative to autochthonous materials) to measured sediment \u03b413C and C:N values \nmay be significant in salt-marsh environments (e.g. Lamb et al., 2006; Gebrehiwet et al., 2008). \n \n 5\nWe investigated the use of \u03b413C and C:N ratios to identify salt-marsh floral zones in bulk-organic \nsediments and reconstruct RSL in North Carolina, USA. Previous studies using \u03b413C and C:N in \nsalt-marsh deposits have used the technique to characterize paleoenvironments and infer \nvegetation change (e.g. Malamud-Roam and Ingram, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005) or to provide \nqualitative information about the depositional environment of radiocarbon-dated samples (e.g. \nChmura and Aharon, 1995; T\u00f6rnqvist et al., 2006, 2008). To date, this technique has not been \nused to quantitatively reconstruct RSL. The \u03b413C and C:N values of surface sediments were \nmeasured along environmental and elevational gradients at two microtidal sites to consider the \npotential accuracy and precision of this approach.  We compare \u03b413C and C:N values from \nplants and surface sediments to better understand the effects of early diagenesis on salt-marsh \nsediments. To demonstrate the application of \u03b413C in reconstructing RSL, we estimated the \nindicative meaning of 11 Holocene sea-level data points from North Carolina and compared the \nresults to those from a foraminifera-based transfer function approach. \n \n2 Study Area \n \nThe Atlantic coast of North Carolina is characterised by sounds separating the mainland from \nthe Outer Banks barrier islands (Pilkey et al., 2002). Water in the sounds reflects the balance \nbetween freshwater input from rivers and exchange of marine water with the Atlantic Ocean \nthrough inlets. The region is micro-tidal and wind-driven water levels regularly exceed the \nmagnitude of astronomical tides.  Salt marshes occupy the margins of the sounds where \nbrackish conditions exist (Pilkey et al., 2002). Spartina alterniflora forms narrow bands of low \nmarsh (Adams, 1963; Brinson, 1991; Woerner and Hackney, 1997). Juncus roemerianus covers \nup to 77 % of salt-marsh area (Eleuterius, 1976) and dominates high marshes (Brinson, 1991). \nOther common species include Distichlis spicata and Spartina patens, which usually occur as \npatches in high marsh environments surrounded by Juncus roemerianus. At sites with low \n 6\nsalinity, Spartina cynusoroides occupies high marshes (e.g. Culver and Horton, 2005).  The \nvertical zonation of salt-marsh plants is limited by the microtidal nature of the study area, but it is \nthis microtidal regime together with continuous sequences of high marsh peat that provides an \nideal setting for reconstructing changes in sea level.  The study region is representative of a \nsubstantial proportion of back-barrier salt marshes on the Atlantic Coast of the USA.  \n \nWe selected two sites on salt marshes at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point (Figure 1a) that \nrepresent different environmental conditions from a larger set of sites where Kemp et al. (2009) \ndocumented modern foraminiferal distributions. The Oregon Inlet site is a high salinity (26 psu; \nWilliams et al., 1973; Culver and Horton, 2005), back-barrier marsh located adjacent to the open \ninlet (Figure 1b). A 250 m long transect of 15 sampling stations (Figures 1b and 2) extended \nfrom a narrow (10 m wide) Spartina alterniflora-dominated low marsh to a large (240 m wide) \nhigh marsh, characterized by Juncus roemerianus, in association with Iva fructescens toward \nthe upper edge of the marsh. The second site, Sand Point, is distal to an open inlet (Figure 1c), \nresulting in low salinity (8 psu; Schwartz and Chestnut, 1973). The marsh is up to 1500 m wide \nand displays a narrow (5 m), low marsh of Spartina alterniflora that is replaced inland by Juncus \nroemerianus and followed by a transition to freshwater upland vegetation. The transect included \n21 sampling stations extending across the marsh into the surrounding upland (Figures 1c and \n2). Similar to many salt-marsh shorelines in the Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine system, this site is \nexperiencing significant erosion and the low marsh receives substantial inputs of reworked high-\nmarsh sediment, which is likely several thousands of years old (Riggs, 2001). Therefore, low \nmarsh environments were not sampled at this site. Tidal flat environments and pioneer stage \nsalt marshes are unusual in North Carolina and were not present at either site. \n \nSalt-marsh plants were collected from three additional sites (Figure 1a). Swan Quarter National \nWildlife Refuge (NWR) is situated at the confluence of the Pamlico River with Pamlico Sound; it \n 7\nis a large, low salinity salt marsh. Ocracoke is a narrow (150 m), higher salinity salt marsh on \nthe Outer Banks. Cedar Island is one of the largest salt marshes in North Carolina (up to 6.7 km \nwide; Brinson, 1991) and is characterized by salinities between 15 and 20 psu. \n \n3 Methods \n \nWe analyzed samples from transects at the Oregon Inlet and Sand Point sites to document the \nmodern distribution of foraminifera and geochemical characteristics of salt-marsh sediment. The \ntransects extended perpendicular to the shoreline from low marsh to freshwater upland \nenvironments. Positioning of samples reflected changes in elevation and vegetation. Sample \nelevations were measured by leveling to geodetic benchmarks (Figure 1b, c). The boundaries \nbetween floral zones were surveyed at as many as 40 locations at each site to estimate the \nelevational range of common plants. We measured the boundaries between a) freshwater \nupland and Juncus roemerianus, b) Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus and c) the \nlower limit of Spartina alterniflora. The program VDatum (Hess et al., 2005) enabled conversion \nfrom orthometric to tidal elevations (expressed relative to local Mean Tide Level, MTL). \n \n3.1 Sediment Grain Size and \u03b413C, C:N ratios and Total Organic Carbon of Modern Sediments \nand Plants \nSurface sediment samples (0-1 cm) were collected for analysis along both transects. \nAdditionally, at Sand Point, we collected 19 samples of Juncus roemerianus and two of \nDistichlis spicata. Plant material was also collected at Swan Quarter NWR (Spartina alterniflora, \nSpartina cynusoroides and Spartina patens), Ocracoke (Distichlis spicata, Salicornia sp., \nSpartina alterniflora, and Spartina patens) and Cedar Island (Iva fructescens, Juncus \nroemerianus, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina cynusoroides and Spartina patens). Sample grain \n 8\nsize was measured using laser diffraction after Allen and Thornley (2004) and Hawkes et al. \n(2007). \n \nFor measurement of \u03b413C and C:N, sediment samples were treated with 5 % HCL for 18 hours, \nwashed with deionised water, dried in an oven at 40 \u00baC overnight and milled to a fine powder \nusing a pestle and mortar. Plant samples were washed with deionised water to remove \nsediment particles, dried in an oven at 40 \u00baC overnight and milled to a fine powder. \n  \n13C\/12C analyses were performed on plant and sediment samples by combustion in a Costech \nElemental Analyser coupled on-line to an Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer. \u03b413C values \nwere calculated to the VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standard (cellulose, Sigma \nChemical prod. no. C-6413) calibrated against NBS-19 and NBS-22. C:N ratios were analysed \non the same instrument and the ratios were calibrated through an acetanilide standard. All C:N \nvalues are expressed on a weight ratio basis. Replicate analysis indicated a precision of <0.1 \u2030 \n(1 SD) for \u03b413C and C:N measurements.  \n \n3.2 Modern Foraminifera \nWe collected surface sediment samples (0-1cm) for foraminiferal analysis. Samples were stored \nin buffered ethanol and stained with rose Bengal (Walton, 1952) to allow identification of live \nindividuals. Samples were sieved to isolate the foraminifera-bearing fraction between 63 \u03bcm and \n500 \u03bcm. Each sample was divided into eight aliquots and a minimum of 200 individuals was \ncounted from a known fraction of the sediment (Scott and Hermelin, 1993; de Rijk, 1995). \nSalt-marsh foraminifera typically form low diversity assemblages and counts of 200 are \nrepresentative of the target population (Fatela and Taborda, 2002). Assemblage zones were \nidentified by unconstrained, hierarchical cluster analysis (Kemp et al., 2009). \n \n 9\n4 Results \n \n4.1 Elevational Distribution of Vascular Plants \nLeveling of floral boundaries provided estimates of the local vertical range of Spartina \nalterniflora and Juncus roemerianus. Despite differences in salinity and tidal range, the \nelevational distribution of plants at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point is similar. At Oregon Inlet, \nSpartina alterniflora occupies mean elevations between -0.09 m and 0.22 m MTL; Juncus \nroemerianus is found from 0.14 m to 0.42 m MTL. At Sand Point, Spartina alterniflora was \ndominant at elevations between -0.10 m and 0.11 m MTL. Juncus roemerianus was the \ndominant plant at elevations ranging from 0.10 m to 0.35 m MTL, but was absent from sites \nabove approximately 0.35 m MTL, where it was replaced by freshwater upland vegetation. \n \n4.2 \u03b413C and C:N ratios of Modern Salt-Marsh Sediments \nAt Oregon Inlet, surface sediments in the Spartina alterniflora low marsh between 0 m and 28 m \nalong the transect exhibited \u03b413C values from -17.6 \u2030 to -16.2 \u2030 (average -17.0 \u2030) and C:N \nratios between 14.8 and 16.1 (Figure 2). These samples had an average total organic carbon \n(TOC) of 7.9 % (4.0 % to 10.7 %) and grain size concentrated in the silt-sized (3.9 \u00b5m to 62.5 \n\u00b5m) fraction (47 % to 71 %, average median grain size, d50, of 22 \u00b5m). Surface sediments in \nJuncus roemerianus environments (28 m to 258 m along the transect) had \u03b413C values between \n-27.1 \u2030 and -24.5 \u2030 (average -26.3 \u2030) and C:N ratios from 14.5 to 22.5 (Figure 2). TOC in \nthese samples averaged 8.3 % (1.7 % to 15.8 %) and grain size was concentrated in the \nsilt-sized fraction (12 % to 71 %, median grain size of 49 \u00b5m). \n \nAt Sand Point, surface sediment samples from 0 m to 454 m along the transect in a Juncus \nroemerianus marsh yielded \u03b413C values from -28.2  \u2030 to -21.8  \u2030 (average -26.3 \u2030) and C:N \nratios between 11.1 and 41.3 (Figure 2). These samples had an average TOC of 24.6 % (14.5 \n 10\n% to 41.3 %) and a median grain size of 35 \u00b5m (16 % to 74 % silt-sized). Samples at the inland \nend of the transect (454 m to 471 m) in a freshwater upland had \u03b413C values between -28.8  \u2030 \nand -26.6  \u2030 (average -27.8 \u2030) and C:N ratios of 41.6 to 48.8. TOC in these samples averaged \n39.2 % (11.1 % to 48.8 %), the median grain size was 83\u00b5m with 26 % to 70 % of clastic \nsediment in the silt-sized fraction. \n \n4.3 \u03b413C and C:N Ratios of Modern Salt-Marsh Plants \nThe \u03b413C and C:N composition of seven common salt-marsh plants is shown in Figure 3. From \n17 specimens at Sand Point, \u03b413C values for Juncus roemerianus ranged from -28.1 \u2030 to -24.9 \n\u2030 (average -26.6 \u2030), C:N ratios for this species varied from 31.8 to 70.3 (average 45.9). Three \nexamples of Distichlis spicata (two from Sand Point and one from Ocracoke) had an average \n\u03b413C content of -15.0 \u2030 (-16.2 \u2030 to -13.1 \u2030) and average C:N ratio of 48.3 (28.0 to 82.6). A \nSalicornia sp. plant from Ocracoke yielded a \u03b413C value of -27.8 \u2030 and a C:N ratio of 58. An Iva \nfructescens plant from Cedar Island had a \u03b413C value of -28.3 \u2030 and C:N ratio of 84.9. Three \nsamples of Spartina alterniflora had \u03b413C values from -13.1 \u2030 to -12.6 \u2030 (average -12.9 \u2030) \nand C:N ratios that averaged 139 (117.4 to 174.5). Two Spartina cynusoroides plants (Cedar \nIsland and Swan Quarter) had \u03b413C values of -12.1 \u2030 and -12.8 \u2030 with C:N ratios of 70.7 and \n343.2. Three Spartina patens plants (one each from Cedar Island, Ocracoke and Swan Quarter \nNWR) displayed \u03b413C values between -13.6 \u2030 and -12.9 \u2030 and C:N ratios of 202.8 to 310.8. \n \n4.4 Elevational Distribution of Modern Foraminifera \nAt Oregon Inlet, 12 species of foraminifera were recorded in 15 samples along a 250 m transect \n(0.02 m to 0.42 m MTL; Figure 4). Between 0 m and 28 m (low marsh, Spartina alterniflora \nzone), the dominant species was Miliammina fusca (up to 78 %). High abundances of \nArenoparrella mexicana (up to 80 %) define the assemblage between 38 m and 223 m. \nVegetation in this part of the marsh consisted of mono-specific stands of Juncus roemerianus.  \n 11\nThe landward edge of the transect was represented by Haplophragmoides wilberti (57 %) and \nwas associated with Juncus roemerianus and Iva fructescens.  \n \nThree elevation-dependent ecological zones were recognized at Oregon Inlet (Figure 4). Zone \nOI-1 extended from 0.02 m to 0.23 m MTL and was defined by high abundances of Miliammina \nfusca. The Arenoparrella mexicana-dominated part of the marsh formed zone OI-2 (0.23 m to \n0.35 m MTL). Foraminiferal assemblages dominated by Haplophragmoides wilberti at elevations \nfrom 0.35 m to 0.42 m MTL constituted zone OI-3. \n \nAt Sand Point, 16 species of foraminifera were recognised at 21 stations across an elevational \nrange from 0.10 m to 0.53 m MTL (Figure 4). Between 0 m and 73 m, the dominant species was \nAmmoastuta inepta (up to 36 %). From 73 m to 137 m, Miliammina fusca (18 % to 59 %) was \ndominant, Ammoastuta inepta (up to 25 %) was an important species between 137 m and 429 \nm. From 429 m to 448 m, Jadammina macrescens was the dominant species (up to 35 %) in \nassociation with Ammoastuta inepta (up to 29 %). All of these intervals were associated with \nJuncus roemerianus. Seven samples, positioned between 448 m and 471 m in the freshwater \nupland contained no foraminifera. Based on foraminiferal assemblages, three \nelevation-dependent ecological zones were recognized at Sand Point. Between 0.10 m and \n0.18 m MTL the dominant species was Miliammina fusca (zone SP-1). High proportions of \nAmmoastuta inepta defined zone SP-2 (0.18 m to 0.30 m MTL). A Jadammina \nmacrescens-dominated zone (SP-3) extended from 0.23 m to 0.35 m MTL. The samples in \nwhich foraminifera were absent were positioned above 0.35 m local MTL. \n \n5 Discussion \n \n5.1 Modern Distribution of Plants and Foraminifera \n 12\nSalt-marsh plant communities form elevation-dependent, floral zones that are correlated to the \nfrequency and duration of tidal inundation (e.g. Chapman, 1940; Redfield, 1972). This \nrelationship has been exploited to reconstruct former RSL by identifying the floral zone \nrepresented by peat preserved in coastal sedimentary sequences (e.g. Shennan, 1986). We \nidentified two salt-marsh zones on the basis of vascular plants. The low marsh at Oregon Inlet \nwas vegetated by Spartina alterniflora (-0.10 m to 0.14 m MTL) and high marshes at Oregon \nInlet and Sand Point were characterized by Juncus roemerianus (0.10 m to 0.42 m MTL). The \nlimited number and narrow range of elevational zones are a factor of micro-tidal regimes at \nOregon Inlet (0.35 m range) and Sand Point (0.17 m range).  \n \nIn areas with larger tides, salt-marsh floral zones exist over an expanded elevational range. On \nthe Atlantic coast of the USA, McKee and Patrick (1988, and references therein) showed that \nthe average elevational range of Spartina alterniflora is 0.93 m (77 % of tidal range) but may be \nas much as 2.4 m (86 % of local tidal range). Adams (1963) showed a strong positive \nrelationship between tidal range and the elevational extent of Spartina alterniflora at sites in \nNorth Carolina (up to 0.9m; 53 % of the tidal range). Similarly, larger tides were associated with \nan expanded elevational range of Juncus roemerianus (Adams, 1963). In the Cape Fear estuary \nof North Carolina, Woerner and Hackney (1997) recorded Juncus roemerianus occupying an \nelevational range of 0.65 m in a region with a tidal range of 1.43 m. Considerable variation in the \nelevational distribution of salt-marsh plants exists between sites and attests to the importance of \nlocal-scale factors (such as salinity and substrate) in determining floral zonation (e.g. McKee \nand Patrick, 1988; Woerner and Hackney, 1997). Gehrels (1994) noted differences in the \nelevational preference of plants between sites and argued that measurements of the elevational \nrange of plant species (including our mean elevational ranges for Spartina alterniflora and \nJuncus roemerianus) should be considered a minimum because study of additional sites is likely \nto expand the observed range. \n 13\n \nForaminifera are more precise sea-level indicators than salt-marsh plants (e.g. Scott and \nMedioli, 1978, 1980; Gehrels, 1994), although direct comparisons in North America are few. At \nfour sites in Maine, Gehrels (1994) showed that plants occupied wider and more variable \nelevational zones than salt-marsh foraminifera and concluded that the most precise (narrowest \nelevational ranges) foraminiferal assemblages were those from high marsh environments at the \ntransition to freshwater upland. Foraminifera at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point also occupied \nnarrower elevational ranges (as small as 0.07m, OI-3) than plants. In contrast, Patterson et al. \n(2000) concluded that the elevational range of plant and foraminiferal zones in British Columbia \nwere similar. Jennings and Nelson (1992) showed that tidal flat, low marsh and high marsh \nzones could be delimited using either plants or foraminifera. \n \n5.2 Sediment \u03b413C Values as Sea-Level Indicators in North Carolina \nPrevious investigations of sediment \u03b413C from salt marshes have alluded to the possibility of \nreconstructing RSL (e.g. Johnson et al., 2007).  The use of \u03b413C and C:N values as sea-level \nindicators requires that they can be assigned an indicative meaning and identify salt-marsh \nzones in sedimentary sequences. Although there is not a simple linear correlation between \nsalt-marsh surface elevation and bulk sediment \u03b413C (Figure 5), there is a strong relationship \nbetween sediment \u03b413C and plant species making it possible to distinguish between sediments \nderived from Spartina alterniflora (C4) and Juncus roemerianus (C3). Three low-marsh samples \nof surface sediment dominated by Spartina alterniflora at Oregon Inlet had \u03b413C values between \n-17.6 \u2030 and -16.2 \u2030. In contrast, Juncus roemerianus-dominated environments at Oregon Inlet \nand Sand Point were characterized by sediment \u03b413C values between -28.2 \u2030 and -21.8 \u2030 \n(average -26.3 \u2030). This difference has been identified elsewhere in North Carolina and at other \nlocations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the USA. In the Pamlico River estuary of North \nCarolina, Craft et al. (1988) differentiated between sediments derived from C4 plants, Juncus \n 14\nroemerianus (-26 \u2030) and forest (-27 \u2030). Goni and Thomas (2000) identified sediments from \nforest (-28.8 \u2030 to -27.5 \u2030), Juncus (-23.8 \u2030 to -21.4 \u2030) and Spartina (-20.1 \u2030 to -17.3 \u2030) \nenvironments in South Carolina. A study by Gebrehiwet et al. (2008) in Georgia, showed a clear \ndifference in \u03b413C values for sediments from Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus \nzones. In Louisiana, Chmura et al. (1987) reported \u03b413C values of -27.8 \u2030, -22.1 \u2030 and 16.2 \u2030 \nfor freshwater upland, intermediate and salt-marsh sediments, respectively. DeLaune (1986) \nrecorded sediments derived from Spartina alterniflora in Louisiana as having an average \u03b413C \nvalue of -16.5 \u2030. Choi et al. (2001) showed that Juncus roemerianus salt-marsh sediments in \nFlorida had an average \u03b413C value of -27 \u2030. In Massachusetts, Middleburg et al. (1997) \ndistinguished between sediments from Spartina-dominated and more brackish environments. \n \nAlthough \u03b413C values from bulk-organic sediments differentiate Spartina alterniflora and Juncus \nroemerianus environments, \u03b413C values  associated with other plants on North Carolina salt \nmarshes must be considered (Figure 3). Three specimens (two from Sand Point and one from \nOcracoke) of Distichlis spicata (a high marsh, C4 plant) yielded an average \u03b413C value of -15.0 \n\u2030 (-16.1 \u2030 to -13.1 \u2030), which is comparable to measurements from other studies (e.g. Ungar, \n1991; Chmura and Aharon, 1995). Spartina patens is also a C4 plant with a patchy distribution in \nhigh marshes (Adams, 1963). Three examples (from Cedar Island, Ocracoke and Swan \nQuarter) had an average \u03b413C value of -13.2 \u2030. According to Chmura and Aharon (1995) this \nspecies has \u03b413C values of -13.6 \u2030 to -11.7 \u2030. Spartina cynusoroides is a low salinity, high \nmarsh plant (C4); two examples from Cedar Island had \u03b413C values of -12.6 \u2030 and -12.8 \u2030. \nChmura and Aharon (1995) listed Spartina cynusoroides as having a \u03b413C range of -13.6 \u2030 to \n-12.0 \u2030. Distichlis spicata, Spartina cynusoroides and Spartina patens have plant tissue \u03b413C \nvalues that are comparable to that of Spartina alterniflora but they are found in high rather than \nlow marshes.  The problem that the wide distribution of these species presents for RSL \nreconstruction in the southeastern USA was highlighted by Chmura and Aharon (1995), who \n 15\nrecognized that high and low marsh C4 plants may be indistinguishable on the basis of plant or \nsediment \u03b413C and C:N values. Regional differences in the distribution of C4 plants and \u03b413C \nvalues must be considered before making paleoenvironmental interpretations (Chmura and \nAharon, 1995). \n \nIn the same way, overlap of sediment \u03b413C values from high marsh (Juncus roemerianus) and \nfreshwater upland zones at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point makes differentiating them difficult. \nThe average \u03b413C of bulk sediments differs only slightly (-26.3 \u2030 for Juncus roemerianus and \n-27.8 \u2030 for freshwater upland zones) and their ranges overlap. Whereas Juncus roemerianus \nsediments displayed \u03b413C values from -28.2 \u2030 to -21.8 \u2030, freshwater upland sediments ranged \nfrom -28.1 \u2030 to -26.8 \u2030.  Several studies have distinguished these environments using \nsediment \u03b413C values (e.g. Chmura et al., 1987; Craft et al., 1988; Chmura and Aharon, 1995; \nGoni and Thomas, 2000), but results from this study show that this distinction is difficult. \n \n5.3 Bulk Sediment and Vegetation \u03b413C, C:N \nWe investigated whether surface sediments adequately represented the dominant type of \nvegetation at the time of accumulation by comparing \u03b413C and C:N values of Juncus \nroemerianus plants to the surface sediment they were collected from at Sand Point (Figure 6). \nThe average difference between plant and surface sediments was 0.8 \u2030, although a single \nsample recorded a difference of 4 \u2030 (Figure 6a). This change is not sufficient to cause samples \nfrom Juncus roemerianus zones to be mis-classified (figure 3) and is similar to differences \nreported elsewhere (e.g. Chmura et al., 1987). In North Carolina, Craft et al. (1988) concluded \nthat the \u03b413C of Juncus roemerianus sediments (-23.8 \u2030) was similar to plant material (-26.0 \n\u2030). Goni and Thomas (2000) showed little difference between \u03b413C from Juncus roemerianus \nplants (-24.9 \u2030) and sediments (-23.8 \u2030). Similarly, Johnson and Calder (1973) and Hackney \n 16\nand Haines (1980) reported little difference between sediment and plant \u03b413C values in Juncus \nroemerianus zones.  \n \nIn contrast, there is a clear difference between \u03b413C of Spartina alterniflora plants and surface \nsediments (Figure 6c). At Oregon Inlet, low marsh, Spartina alterniflora sediments had \u03b413C \nvalues from -17.6 \u2030 to -16.2 \u2030 (Figures 2 and 6c), whilst plants (from Ocracoke, Swan Quarter \nNWR and Cedar Island) had less depleted values ranging from -13.1 \u2030 to -12.6 \u2030 (Figures 3 \nand 6c). Spartina alterniflora-derived sediments commonly have more negative \u03b413C values \nthan living plant tissue from this species. In North Carolina, Craft et al. (1988) showed that \nSpartina alterniflora plants had an average \u03b413C value of -12.0 \u2030, whilst corresponding surface \nsediments had an average \u03b413C value of -18.4 \u2030. Goni and Thomas (2000) reported changes of \n4.0 \u2030 to 6.8 \u2030 between Spartina alterniflora tissue and sediment. Chmura et al. (1987) found \nthat sediments were depleted by up to 4 \u2030 in comparison with plant material. In Georgia, Fogel \net al. (1989) recorded sediments that were up to 5.5 \u2030 more depleted than Spartina alterniflora \nplants. Changes in \u03b413C values between plants and bulk-organic sediment are probably not \nsufficiently large to cause Spartina alterniflora environments to be misidentified and assigned an \nerroneous indicative meaning (Figures 3 and 5). \n \nDifferences between plant and sediment \u03b413C values may be caused by decomposition during \naccumulation of organic material (Lamb et al., 2006). According to Ember et al. (1987), Spartina \nalterniflora values for plant tissues and bulk sediments are different due to fractionation of \norganic carbon within the living plant and the subsequent preferential breakdown of cellulose \nover lignin. Lignin \u03b413C is typically more depleted than cellulose \u03b413C or the \u03b413C from the plant \nas a whole (Vane et al., 2003; Lamb et al., 2006). During decomposition, lignin is preferentially \nconcentrated in surface sediments resulting in a relative depletion of sediment \u03b413C (Chmura et \nal., 1987; Chmura and Aharon, 1995: Mallamud-Roam and Ingram, 2001). Alternatively, \u03b413C of \n 17\nbulk sediments may differ from plant tissue due to allochthonous carbon inputs. Sources include \nfluvial or marine particulate and dissolved organic carbon (Lamb et al., 2006). Low marsh \nsettings are most likely to be inundated by astronomical tides and storms, whilst high marsh \nsettings are more likely to receive inputs of terrestrial organic carbon. However, Chmura et al. \n(1987) concluded that local plants were the main source of organic carbon in salt marshes and \nthat sediment \u03b413C values were representative of the dominant vegetation.  On longer \ntimescales, two studies in the San Francisco Bay estuary (Byrne et al., 2001; Malamud-Roam \nand Ingram, 2004) showed that salt-marsh zones could be reliably identified in sediments more \nthan 3000 years after deposition, whilst Lamb et al. (2007) compared downcore \u03b413C values in \nsediments up to 3300 years old to foraminiferal assemblages and concluded that there was little \nfractionation. \n \nC:N ratios are strongly influenced by post-depositional processes. At Sand Point, organic \nsediment C:N ratios were lower than those recorded in plants (Figure 6b). Goni and Thomas \n(2000) demonstrated the tendency for forest, Juncus- and Spartina-derived sediments to have \ncomparable C:N ratios despite large differences in the C:N ratio of source vegetation. The \nsimilarity in bulk sediment C:N ratios is a consequence of nitrogen retention coupled with carbon \nloss through oxidation of plant material during decomposition (Ember et al., 1987; Chmura et al., \n1987). The size of this change makes it difficult to reconstruct the salt-marsh zone in which bulk-\norganic sediments formed because C:N ratios from different zones converge during early \ndiagenesis, rendering them unsuitable for reconstructing former RSL. \n \n5.4 Implications for Reconstructing Holocene Relative Sea Level \nWe examined the utility of sediment \u03b413C as a sea-level indicator by reconstructing RSL from \npublished sea-level data. Horton et al. (2009) compiled a database of validated North Carolina \nHolocene sea-level index points and data points that constrain the maximum and minimum \n 18\nelevation of RSL (freshwater and marine limiting points). We considered a sub-sample of eight \nsea-level index points and three freshwater limiting points.  Estimates of the indicative meaning \nwere based on the elevational range of modern salt-marsh plants and recognition of these floral \nzones from the analogy between modern and fossil sediment \u03b413C values (Table 1; Figure 7). \n \nSediment \u03b413C values from -26.7 \u2030 to -21.8 \u2030 were considered to represent a Juncus \nroemerianus floral zone. Freshwater upland zones are identified by sediment \u03b413C values more \ndepleted than -28.2 \u2030.  Sediments with intermediate values could be from either zone and are \nassigned an indicative meaning reflecting this uncertainty.  These values may only be \nappropriate for the study region (Chmura and Aharon, 1995) and additional studies from meso- \nand macrotidal regions incorporating high, low and pioneer marshes and tidal flat environments \nwould be appropriate and necessary for efforts to reconstruct RSL from other regions.  From \nleveling of floral zone boundaries at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point we assigned Spartina \nalterniflora zones an indicative meaning of 0.02 m MTL \u00b1 0.12 m and Juncus roemerianus \nzones were assigned an indicative meaning of 0.26 m MTL \u00b1 0.16 m. In the case of C4 plants, \nsediment \u03b413C values cannot distinguish between specific plants, therefore we gave them an \nindicative meaning of 0.16 m MTL \u00b1 0.26 m, because they can occupy the full elevational range \nof salt-marshes in North Carolina. For comparison, alternative estimates of the indicative \nmeaning were produced using a transfer function based upon the modern distribution of \nforaminifera in the Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine system (Kemp et al., 2009). This statistical \ntechnique has become common-place for reconstructing RSL from salt-marshes (Gehrels, \n2007). \n \nSea-level index points 1 to 3 (table one) had \u03b413C values between -25.5 \u2030 and -21 \u2030 and \nrepresent Juncus roemerianus zones.  Foraminiferal data provided estimated reference water \nlevels (RWL) between 0.20 m and 0.29 m MTL with an average indicative range (IR) of \u00b1 0.05 \n 19\nm. Index point 4 was identified as being from either a Juncus roemerianus or freshwater upland \nzone because it had an intermediate \u03b413C value of -26.67 \u2030. However, foraminifera indicated \nthat it formed in brackish rather than freshwater conditions and was assigned an indicative \nmeaning of 0.19 m MTL \u00b1 0.05 m. Sea-level index points 5 to 8 had \u03b413C values typical of C4 \nvegetation (Table 1) and were assigned an indicative meaning spanning the entire elevational \nrange of salt-marsh vegetation (Figure 7; Table 1). Foraminifera associated with these samples \nestimated RWLs from 0.12 m to 0.25 m MTL with an average IR of \u00b1 0.05 m (Figure 7; Table 1). \nThe RWL estimated for sea-level index points using \u03b413C values are not significantly different \nfrom transfer function estimates. Foraminifera are more precise sea-level indicators that are \nable to estimate the indicative meaning of samples from all salt-marsh zones. In contrast, \nsediment \u03b413C values are restricted to describing broad changes in RSL by identifying sea-level \nindex points (with large uncertainties) derived from salt marshes dominated by C4 vegetation. \n \nFreshwater limiting points are derived from supra-tidal environments and provide an important \nconstraint on the upper limit of former RSL (Shennan, 2007). We considered three samples that \nwere defined as freshwater limiting points by Horton et al. (2009) on the basis of diatom and \npollen assemblages and an absence of foraminifera (Mallinson et al., 2005; Culver et al., 2008). \nUsing this microfossil evidence, we recognized samples 9, 10 and 11 as freshwater limiting \npoints (Table 1, Figure 7). The reported \u03b413C values of these samples were -28.0 \u2030, -27.21 \u2030 \nand -26.35 \u2030. Due to the difficulty in separating freshwater upland and Juncus roemerianus-\ndominated zones, samples with \u03b413C values between -28.5 \u2030 and -26.0 \u2030 may represent either \nzone and were assigned an indicative meaning reflecting this uncertainty (Table 1, Figure 7). \n \n5.5 Refinement of \u03b413C and C:N as Sea-Level Indicators \nA key issue in using bulk-organic sediment \u03b413C and C:N values to reconstruct sea-level is the \ndifficulty in identifying salt-marsh zones dominated by a particular plant species.  We have \n 20\nshown that it is possible to recognize sediments derived from C3 or C4 zones and that the \napplication of this approach is limited by the broad elevational tolerance of C4 plants and \nproblems distinguishing between freshwater upland and salt-marsh C3 plant zones.  Measured \nvalues of \u03b413C and C:N in bulk sediment incorporate the influence of allochthonous material and \nplant decomposition, which may distort the signal from the dominant plant community.  \n \nOne approach that might overcome these difficulties is to analyze \u03b413C values from a specific \nfraction of the sediment, which may include organic components from only the dominant plant \ncommunity.  For example, some components may consist of the fraction that is soluble in \ncommon organic solvents (lipids, pigments, flavonoids) or the insoluble fraction such as lignin, \ntannins and structural polysaccharides (Stephenson et al., 2005, 2008). Molecular level studies \nof lipids and major cell wall polymers (e.g. lignin, tannins and structural polysaccharides) may \nbe potential indicators of plant source and vegetation zones (Benner et al., 1991; Goni et al., \n2000; Herenes, 2001). In particular, lignin is well preserved in salt-marsh sediments (Vane et \nal., 2003, 2005, 2006; Lamb et al., 2007). Analytical pyrolysis, tetra alkyl chemolysis, and \nalkaline CuO oxidation are frequently applied to cleave bonds within the lignin structure and \nyield monomers that can be separated and identified by gas-chromatography mass-\nspectrometry (GC\/MS).  Assuming the distribution and quantity of monomers can be related to \nplant species, they may be used to identify the dominant type of vegetation in sediments (Goni \net al., 2000; Vane, 2003) \n \nA second possible approach is to analyze sediment \u03b413C values retained in particular organic \ncompounds, namely n-alkanes.  Compound-specific isotopic analysis (CSIA) of long chain n-\nalkanes nC21-nC33 in salt-marsh sediments has been used to distinguish specific plant \ncommunities in northeastern USA (Wang et al., 2003 in Massachusetts; Tanner et al., 2007 in \nMaine). Gas chromatography isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) of individual n-\n 21\nalkanes extracted from living plants showed that the nC27 and nC29 homologues were abundant \nin all plants and could distinguish Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens (C4) from C3 plants \nsuch as Juncus spp. based upon a 3.0 to 6.4 \u2030 minimum difference (Tanner et al., 2007). \nHowever, other homologues such as nC31 were not present in all plants and are variable in \nabsolute concentration; high concentrations of compounds are generally considered a \nprerequisite for GC\/IRMS analysis. Although detailed molecular techniques show considerable \npromise as tools to identify vegetation zones, they are presently more timing consuming and \ncostly than carbon isotope analysis of bulk-organic sediment. \n \n6 Conclusions \n \nWe investigated the use of bulk-organic sediment geochemistry as a means of identifying floral \nzones that could be used as sea-level indicators. \u03b413C values and C:N ratios were measured \nalong modern transects of surface sediment at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point (North Carolina, \nUSA) and compared to elevational zones defined by plants and foraminiferal assemblages. \nSediment \u03b413C values do not have a simple linear correlation with elevation but can distinguish \nzones dominated by Spartina alterniflora (C4 photosynthetic pathway, \u03b413C values from -17.6 \u2030 \nto -16.2 \u2030) and Juncus roemerianus (C3 photosynthetic pathway \u03b413C values from -28.2 \u2030 to \n-21.8 \u2030). The elevational range of the two floral zones at these sites reflects the microtidal \nnature of the region. Comparison between the geochemical characteristics of Juncus \nroemerianus plants and surface sediments revealed that there is little change in \u03b413C values \nduring diagenesis (average 0.8 \u2030). Based on three samples, the difference between Spartina \nalterniflora plants and sediment was approximately 4 \u2030. In contrast, C:N ratios are significantly \naltered during early diagenesis, causing low marsh, high marsh and freshwater upland \nsediments to have similar values. \n \n 22\nThe elevational distribution of common salt-marsh plants was used to estimate the indicative \nmeaning of sea-level index points using sediment \u03b413C values to identify floral zones. The use of \nsediment \u03b413C values as independent sea-level indicators is complicated in North Carolina by C4 \nplants (such as the low marsh species Spartina alterniflora and high marsh species including \nDistichlis spicata, Spartina cynusoroides and Spartina patens) occupying the full elevational \nrange of salt-marsh environments. Uncertainty in differentiating between sediments derived \nfrom these plant species on the basis of \u03b413C values results in a large indicative range. \nFurthermore, Juncus roemerianus-dominated sediments from high marsh settings cannot be \nadequately distinguished from the sediment of freshwater upland zones. \n \nIn instances where microfossil assemblages are absent from the fossil record or have \nundergone significant post-depositional modification, \u03b413C values may help distinguish the \nsediments of former high and low marshes. Refined analysis using \u03b413C values from specific \nfracations of sediment may increase the possible precision of RSL reconstructions from \ngeochemical proxies preserved in bulk-organic sediments by recognizing particular plant \nspecies.   \n 23\nAcknowledgements \n \nC.H.

For each \nsample, a Reference Water Level (RWL) and Indicative Range (IR) were estimated using \nsediment \u03b413C values and a foraminifera-based transfer function. *The RWL assigned to \nfreshwater limiting points reflects the quantitative diatom evidence (with an absence of \nforaminifera) reported in Horton et al. (2009).  \n 25\nFigure Captions \n \nFigure 1: (A) Location of the Oregon Inlet and Sand Point sites in coastal North Carolina. \nForaminifera, \u03b413C and C:N were measured in samples along two transects (dashed lines, X to \nY) at (B) Oregon Inlet and (C) Sand Point. Sample elevations were established by leveling to \ngeodetic benchmarks. (D) The components of indicative meaning, which defines the relationship \nbetween a sea-level indicator and elevation in the tidal frame. HAT = Highest Astronomical Tide, \nMHHW = Mean Higher High Water, MTL = Mean Tide Level. \n \nFigure 2: Pattern of \u03b413C, C:N, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and grain size of bulk-organic \nsediment along modern transects at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point. Median grain size (d50) in \u00b5m \nis shown by dots and percentage clay by volume is shown by vertical grey bars. Solid circles \nshow samples collected in Juncus roemerianus environments; at Oregon Inlet samples from the \nSpartina alterniflora (SA) low marsh are shown as hollow circles; at Sand Point these represent \nsamples from the freshwater upland. \n \nFigure 3: \u03b413C and C:N values measured from modern specimens of common salt-marsh plants \nand bulk-organic sediment in North Carolina. Grey boxes represent the range of values thought \nto be representative of C3 and C4 plants (after Lamb et al., 2006). Dashed lines are the average \n\u03b413C of C4 (-12 \u2030; Schlesinger, 1997) and C3 (-27 \u2030; Choi et al., 2001) plants.  \n \nFigure 4: (A) Distribution of samples, vegetation and dominant salt-marsh foraminifera along \nmodern transects at Oregon Inlet and Sand Point. Only species that dominant foraminiferal \nzones are presented. Solid circles show samples collected in Juncus roemerianus \nenvironments; at Oregon Inlet samples from the Spartina alterniflora (SA) low marsh are shown \nas hollow circles; at Sand Point these represent samples from the freshwater upland. Elevation-\ndependent ecological zones of foraminifera at Oregon Inlet (OI) and Sand Point (SP) defined by \ncluster analysis are presented for each site. \n \nFigure 5: (A) The relationship between surface sediment \u03b413C values and elevation at Oregon \nInlet and Sand Point. Samples are differentiated on the basis of the floral environment from \nwhich they were collected. (B) The indicative meaning assigned to Juncus roemerianus (Jr), \nSpartina alterniflora (Sa), C4 and freshwater upland vegetation zones based on levelling of the \nboundaries between floral zones. The elevational ranges are a minimum estimate. \n \nFigure 6: Comparison of plant and bulk sediment \u03b413C values (A) and C:N ratios (B) from a \nJuncus roemerianus-dominated salt marsh at Sand Point. (C) Non-paired samples of Spartina \nalterniflora plants (open circles; Ocracoke, Swan Quarter and Cedar Island) and sediments \n(filled circles; Oregon Inlet). \n \nFigure 7: Indicative meanings of eight sea-level index points and three freshwater limiting \npoints from a database of North Carolina Holocene sea-level data. Estimates of indicative \nmeaning were made on the basis of sediment \u03b413C values (grey boxes) and a foraminifera-\nbased transfer function (white boxes). Hashed boxes represent the inference made from diatom \nevidence that the samples were formed in a freshwater upland environment. Arrows represent \nshow that estimates associated with freshwater limiting points are minimums. MTL = Mean Tide \nLevel.\n 26\nReferences \n \nAdams, D.A. 1963.
