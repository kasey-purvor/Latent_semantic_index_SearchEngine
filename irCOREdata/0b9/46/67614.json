We described the ground signatures of dynamic\nsubstorm features as observed by the imaging riometer, mag-\nnetometers and all-sky camera (ASC) at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland\non 5 and 25 October 1999 during the late evening hours. The\nmagnetometer data was consistent with the motion of up-\nward field-aligned currents (FACs) associated with absorp-\ntion patches moving within the field of view of the riometer.\nWe used riometer data in order to estimate the intensity of\nFACs associated with these local current-carrying filaments.\nIt is shown that during these events, the estimated FAC in-\ntensity exceeds a threshold value that corresponds to the ex-\ncitation of the low-frequency turbulence in the upper iono-\nsphere. As a result, a quasi-oscillating regime of anomalous\nresistivity on the auroral field lines can give rise to the burst-\nlike electron acceleration responsible for simultaneously ob-\nserved auroral forms and bursts of Pi1B pulsations.\nKey words. Ionosphere (active experiments; auroral iono-\nsphere; electric fields and currents\n1 Introduction\nInvestigations of field-aligned currents (FACs) in the auroral\nregion are of great interest because it is a well established fact\nthat FACs are responsible for the linkage between magneto-\nspheric and ionospheric plasmas, and FACs are thus impor-\ntant for the understanding of the magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling.\nIt is also well-known from polar region electrodynamics\nthat the ground magnetic signatures of the ionospheric cur-\nrent systems are solely due to the source-free part of the iono-\nspheric current system (due to Hall currents in the case of\na uniform ionospheric conductance distribution (Fukushima,\n1976)). This means that the curl-free part of the ionospheric\ncurrent, together with the FACs, does not produce any mag-\nnetic field disturbance below the ionosphere and is thus mag-\nCorrespondence to: M. A. Danielides\n(michael.danielides@oulu.fi)\nnetically invisible on the ground, but can be detected above\nthe ionosphere by satellites.\nSince the ground magnetic field disturbances depend on\nthe height-integrated horizontal ionospheric current J\u22a5, and\nsince this current and the electric field in the ionosphere E\u22a5\nare connected by Ohm\u2019s law via the Hall (6H ) and Pedersen\n(6P ) conductances, it would seem possible then, in princi-\nple, by using divergence-free conditions for the total current,\nto estimate FACs from magnetic and electric field data if, for\nexample, the ratio 6H \/6P is assumed to be known. It is,\nhowever, usually difficult to make a quantitative analysis of\nFACs because there is no simple way to estimate the iono-\nspheric conductivity distribution or the particle flux.\nIn addition, the precipitation of energetic particles in, for\nexample, auroral arcs can result in small-scale (filamentary)\nFACs and conductivity gradients. Such filaments which can\nalso be highly variable in time (for example, with a charac-\nteristic scale of 30 seconds or less for pulsating aurora) occur\nwithin localized regions as small as 1\u201330 km, i.e. within the\nauroral arc thickness. Strong conductivity gradients modify\nthe convection-driven electrojets and the associated convec-\ntion electric fields. However, measurements of electric fields,\ncurrents, and conductivities for a localized region of 30 km\nor less in dimension and with an appropriate time resolution\nare rather difficult to obtain by satellites, rockets, and most\nground-based experiments.\nIonospheric Hall and Pedersen conductances can be de-\nrived, for example, from auroral spectroscopic measurements\nobtained with meridional scanning photometers (Mende et\nal., 1984; Robinson et al., 1989). Conductances can also be\nderived from height profiles of electron density obtained by\nincoherent scatter radars (see, for example, Schlegel, 1988;\nRobinson et al., 1989). While a general agreement is ob-\ntained by using these basically different methods, some dis-\nagreements illustrate the limitations of these experimental\ntechniques. The radar yields accurate values of conductances\nwith limited temporal and spatial resolution, while the opti-\ncal measurements provide less accurate values with high time\nresolution and over a large region of space.\n700 M. A. Danielides et al.: Estimates of the FAC densities in current-carring filaments\nAn elegant analytical approach was developed by Inhester\net al. (1992) and Amm (1995) (called \u201dmethod of charac-\nteristics\u201d) in order to derive ionospheric Hall conductance\ndistribution 6H from ground magnetic and ionospheric elec-\ntric field observations (hence by estimating 6H \/6P the re-\nmaining ionospheric electrodynamical parameters can be in-\nferred).\nFor the events under study here, however, incoherent scat-\nter radar data was not available for the conductance and elec-\ntric field measurements, nor were the TV images calibrated\nin intensity. But two other experiments were available: the\nImaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) (Detrick\nand Rosenberg, 1990) for ionospheric absorption of cosmic\nradio noise, and the International Monitor for Auroral Ge-\nomagnetic Effects (IMAGE) magnetometer network (Lu\u00a8hr,\n1994) for geomagnetic field disturbances and the correspond-\ning equivalent currents. The data from these instruments\nwere used as input parameters in our model calculations,\nwhich allowed us to detect and to estimate FAC intensities\nin current-carrying filaments. Next, we analysed a corre-\nlation of the suspected FAC filaments with some additional\nauroral phenomena observed by ASC and a pulsation mag-\nnetometer in order to see in which events the most intense\nFACs were involved. We estimated from theoretical argu-\nments the threshold value of FAC needed to produce these\nphenomena just under the center of a current-carrying flux\ntube and compared the threshold value with values calcu-\nlated from experimental data. After such a comparison, we\nnoted that at times the calculated FAC intensity exceeded the\ntheoretically-defined threshold value that corresponded to the\nexcitation of the low-frequency turbulence in the upper iono-\nsphere. Finally, we interpreted the observed correlation be-\ntween the appearance of aurora, PiB pulsation activity, and\nstrong FACs through the mechanism related to the develop-\nment of a quasi-oscillatory regime of anomalous resistivity\nand caused by the presence of the low-frequency turbulence\non the auroral field lines.\n2 Observations\nThe imaging riometer data was obtained from the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi\nIRIS system in northern Finland (69.05 N, 20.79 E, L\u22486).\nThe system operates at 38.2 MHz, and uses an array of 64\ncrossed half wave dipoles over a ground plane, with a set\nof Butler matrices from 49 independent beams. The signals\nare received by time\u2013sharing into 7 riometers, the outputs of\nwhich are digitised (12 bits) every second. The time reso-\nlution is 1 second. The zenithal beam is 13\u25e6 wide between\nhalf power points and the best spatial resolution at 90 km\nis 20 km. The oblique beams are considerably wider. The\neighth riometer is connected to a wide-beam antenna at the\nsite which covers a circle with a radius of 50 km at the 90 km\nlevel (Hargreaves et al., 1991, 1997; Detrick and Rosenberg,\n1990).\nThe IMAGE project includes 15 ground-based magnetome-\nters covering the range from sub-auroral through auroral lati-\n19:20 19:40 20:00 20:20 20:40 21:00\n0\n0.5\n1\nA\nbs\nor\np.\n[d\nB]\n19:00 19:20 19:40 20:00 20:20 20:40 21:00\n\u2212100\n\u221250\n0\n50\nB x\n \n[n\nT]\n19:00 19:20 19:40 20:00 20:20 20:40 21:00\n\u221220\n0\n20\nB y\n \n[n\nT]\n19:00 19:20 19:40 20:00 20:20 20:40 21:00\n\u221250\n0\n50\n100\n150\nB z\n \n[n\nT]\nTime [UT]\n(a)\n16:30 16:40 16:50 17:00 17:10 17:20 17:30\n0\n1\n2\nA\nbs\nor\np.\n[d\nB]\n16:30 16:40 16:50 17:00 17:10 17:20 17:30\n\u2212400\n\u2212200\n0\nB x\n \n[n\nT]\n16:30 16:40 16:50 17:00 17:10 17:20 17:30\n\u2212300\n\u2212200\n\u2212100\n0\nB y\n \n[n\nT]\n]\n16:30 16:40 16:50 17:00 17:10 17:20 17:30\n\u2212300\n\u2212200\n\u2212100\n0\n100\nB z\n \n[n\nT]\nTime [UT]\n(b)\nFig. 1.

We focused on local magne-\ntometer measurements obtained at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi. Multi-instru-\nmental data, including riometer and ASC images, as well\nas pulsation magnetometer data from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi were also\nadded in order to study the spatial and temporal development\nof the phenomena involved. The selected time periods were\ncharacterized by disturbed geomagnetic conditions (Ap = 18\non 5 October 1999 and Ap = 16 on 25 October 1999).\nFigure 1 (panels from the top) shows relevant ground-based\nwide-beam absorption data from the imaging riometer IRIS\nand magnetograms (x-, y- and z- components) from the IM-\nAGE station at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, respectively. From magnetometer\ndata it can be seen that there are several activations observed\nat Kilpisja\u00a8rvi on 5 October 1999 from 19:00 to 21:00 UT,\nnamely at 19:57:40 and 20:30:10 UT, as well as on 25 Octo-\nber 1999 in the time interval from 16.30 to 17.30 UT, namely\nat 16:41, 16:49, 17:09, and 17:19 UT. On 5 October 1999,\nthe two activation regions were located close to substorm on-\nsets. However, among the activations on 25 October 1999,\nonly the one at 17.09 UT marks the onset of an expansive\nphase of the substorm, as follows from the analysis of data\nfrom the whole IMAGE array (not shown here). Each acti-\nvation is associated with an increase in riometer absorption\nand with a magnetic perturbation consistent with the devel-\nopment of filamentary upward FACs (seen in total equivalent\ncurrent patterns (not shown here); the latter is also inferred\nfrom the behaviour of the z-component).\nThis interpretation is confirmed by displaying the Differ-\nential Equivalent Currents (DECs) with a differential time of\n1 = 30 seconds. Figure 2 a-e shows the DEC vectors on 5\nOctober 1999 at 19:57:40 and 20:30:10 UT, as well as on\n25 October 1999 at 17:10:50 to 17:11:10 UT with the time\nresolution of 10 seconds. It follows from Fig. 2 that an an-\nticlockwise current circulation around a center is exhibited\nwhen the current pattern is added to the former existing pat-\ntern. Such an equivalent current loop will be generated if\na vertical upward directed FAC is escaping from a laterally\nhomogeneous ionosphere (see, for example, Bo\u00a8singer et al.,\n1981).\nThe corresponding activity, as seen by auroral the all-sky\ncamera (ASC), shows a distinct increase in auroral luminos-\nity around 19:57 and 20:30 UT on 5 October 1999 and shortly\nafter 16:41, 16:46, 16:50 and 17:06 UT on 25 October 1999\n(Figs. 3a, b, upper panel), whereas Figs. 4a, b presents the in-\nduction coil magnetometer data of the magnetic H\u2013component\nduring the same time interval, displaying pulsations in the\nPi2 and Pi1B frequency range. PiB\u2019s are defined as broad-\nband impulses. The long\u2013period (T = 40\u2212150 seconds) and\nthe short\u2013period (T = 1\u2212 40 seconds) parts of the impulses\nare usually specified by the abbreviations Pi2 and Pi1B, re-\nspectively (Saito, 1969; Kangas et al., 1979; Bo\u00a8singer and\nWedeken, 1987).\nComparing all activations and corresponding ionospheric\neffects, we note that the last activation at 17:19 UT, while it\nis also associated with the FAC, is accompanied by neither\nmagnetic pulsations in the PiB range nor auroral activity.\nThere exists strong arguments that in order for a field-\naligned potential drop to build up enough strength to accel-\nerate electrons to several hundred eV which is necessary for\nthe excitation of auroral emissions, the FAC must exceed a\ncritical value sufficient to cause plasma instabilities (Kindel\nand Kennel, 1971). We believe that it is the FAC intensity\nwhich is responsible for the complete set of phenomena ob-\nserved just under the center of the current-carrying filament\nstructure. It implies that the FAC intensity must exceed some\nthreshold value. Both numerical and theoretical estimates of\nthis value will be presented in the next section.\n3 Theoretical estimates\nWe estimate first the magnitude of FAC in the upper iono-\nsphere which is needed to produce aurora. As noted by Swift\n(1978), current-driven anomalous resistivity associated with\nplasma turbulence is most important where the electron drift\nvelocity VD = j\u2016\/ne is maximal. To determine at which\nheight this takes place, the calculation of the drift velocity\nwas performed (Mozer et al., 1980) using a measured plasma\ndensity profile. In this, the fact that the current density j\u2016\nscales as the magnetic field strength B is considered when\nthe current in a flux tube is conserved. They found that the\ndrift velocity peaks in the region of 6000\u20137000 km. The cor-\nresponding FAC at this distance (R \u2265 RE) was estimated to\nbe\nj\n(m)\n\u2016 ' 1.3 \u00b7 10\u22126 A\/m2 (1)\n(Mozer et al., 1980).\nFor a dipole geomagnetic field B(R) = BE \u00b7 (RE\/R)3\n(where BE is the magnetic field on the ground, at R = RE),\nand using the conservation of magnetic flux and the total cur-\nrent in a magnetic flux tube, the relationship between the\nFAC density j (m)\u2016 in the magnetosphere at a distance Rm\nand j (i)\u2016 in the ionosphere at Ri can be obtained as follows:\nj\n(m)\n\u2016 = j (i)\u2016 \u00b7 (Ri\/Rm)3 . Assuming that Ri \u223c RE and Rm \u223c\n2RE , we obtain that the ionospheric FAC density is j (i)\u2016 \u2265\n5\u00b5A\/m2.\n4 Numerical estimates\nTo obtain a representative figure, we used the formula given\nin the Appendix\nj i\u2016 =\n(\n290\n\u00b50R\n)(\na(2a2 \u2212 r2)\n(a2 + r2)5\/2\n)\n(2)\nfor the FACs associated with observed magnetic disturbances\nand absorption spikes.

As a\nreference, a geographic grid, coastlines, and national borderlines are underlayed.

Regions of intense luminosity can be\nfound for the same times as in Fig. 1. In the lower panel the field-\naligned current (FAC) density estimated by formula (8) from the\nappendix is shown. A dash-dotted line shows a theoretical estimated\nthreshold value of 10\u22125A\/m2. In (a) the strong activations exceed\nthis value at 19:57 and 20:30 UT. The first three activations in (b)\nclearly reach this value. However, the last activation around 17:19\nUT stays below this threshold value.\nwhere A is the ionospheric absorption at 30 MHz in dB. The\nabsorption at frequency f is given by Walker and Bhatnagar\n(1989):\nA(f ) \u2248 A\n(\n30\u00b1 fL\nf \u00b1 fL\n)2\n, (5)\nwhere fL is the electron gyrofrequency (about 1.6 MHz at 90\nkm altitude), and the plus\/minus corresponds to ordinary\/ex-\ntraordinary mode wave. From these formulas we can esti-\nmate the value R for absorption observed with the IRIS sys-\ntem at a frequency of f = 38.2 MHz in our experimental\ndata.\nThe radius a and the distance r can be calculated by an\nalgorithm where the main points are as follows:\n1. We select as a background level for the absorption the\naverage value during the time interval under considera-\ntion (around 0.5 dB in our case);\n2. For each absorption event above this level, the coordi-\nnates of maximum absorption, which are taken as the\ncenter of the current-carrying flux tube, can be deter-\nmined (hence the distance r from the observational point\nto the center of the tube can be determined);\n3. The radius of the flux tube in the presented case is sim-\nply given as the half-width of the absorption patch im-\nage in the IRIS field of view. (For a more general ap-\nproach, the morphology of the absorption filament can\nbe taken into account.)\nThe geometry, size, and location of the absorption filament\nis used to estimate j\u2016 by formula 8 in the Appendix.\nTaking all of these points into account, the current density\nduring the selected time interval has been calculated, and the\nresults are presented in Figs. 3a and 3b (lower panel). The\ndashed line marks the threshold current density estimated in\nthe previous section.\n5 Discussion and concluding comments\nThe method used in the present study seems to be applicable\nfor the estimation of FAC intensity associated with localized\nauroral structures detected within the field of view of both\nIRIS and ASC, provided there is no delay between auroral\nand absorption events (or at least the delay is not more than\na few tens of seconds). In this case, the precipitations as-\nsociated with aurora and absorption can approximately oc-\ncupy the same ionospheric region and the current filament\nco-locates with the absorption spot which is generally not\nthe case. For example, in a study using a network of broad-\nbeam riometers and all-sky camera data, Collis and Korth\n(1983) reported a delay of about 2 min between the passage\nof a visible westward travelling surge and a sharp onset of ra-\ndio absorption. Stocker at al. (1997) similarly observed the\ndelay which varied from 0 to 60 sec.\nAs shown in Figs. 3a, b, the threshold value of FAC den-\nsity measured at a given site is comparable to the estimated\nthreshold level by each activation. In the case of the last ac-\ntivation on 25 October 1999 around 17:19 UT, only low au-\nroral excitation is seen.\nThe estimated FAC density is, in general, equal or lower\nthan the threshold value during this event. We suggest that\npart of the current can be attributed with high-energy parti-\ncles which are responsible for the production of the absorp-\ntion spike, while the other part of the current with a value\nwhich is probably less than the threshold can be attributed\nwith relatively cold plasma, which is responsible for the well-\ndeveloped region of anomalous resistivity and, as a conse-\nquence, the development of the aurora and PiB pulsations.\n704 M.

The H-component of the pulsation magnetometer observations from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (a) on 5 October 1999 from 19:40 to 20:40 UT and\n(b) on 25 October 1999 from 16:30 to 17:30 UT is shown in the upper panel. Below, a frequency spectrum for the same time is shown. The\nfour activation regions from the preview figures show significant Pi2 and Pib1 pulsations.\nHowever, it is difficult to separate the relative contribution of\nthe different plasma content into FAC.\nNote that the absorption area shown by the IRIS data co-\nincides with the local particle precipitation region, whereas\nthe pulsation magnetometer responds to changes over a wide\ncurrent region. Therefore, it may well be that the mag-\nnetic disturbance recorded at 17:19 UT originates in a strong\ncurrent filament with its center far from Kilpisja\u00a8rvi. If we\ncheck the complete IMAGE data set, it appears that the max-\nimum magnetic disturbances were observed to the west from\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi at stations Tromso and Andenes.\nFurther, it is known that the Pi1B amplitude maximum ob-\nserved on the ground is located just underneath active auroral\nforms (see, for example, Haldoupis et al., 1982; Bo\u00a8singer and\nM. A. Danielides et al.: Estimates of the FAC densities in current-carring filaments 705\nWedeken, 1987; Arnold et al., 1998, and references therein).\nWe computed the same relationship in our study (see Figs.\n3a, b and 4a, b). Note, however, the fact that the Pi1B ac-\ntivity maximum may not co-locate with the point of observa-\ntion, which imposes an apparent limitation on our method.\nNow, using the observed correlation of auroral and Pi1\npulsation activity in conjunction with strong FACs, we can\nproduce theoretical arguments why aurora may be connected\nwith the simultaneous appearance of Pi1 bursts. One of the\npossible explanations may be the following: we note that the\nvalue obtained for the magnetospheric current density j (m)\u2016\nexceeded the threshold for the excitation of low-frequency\nturbulence in the topside ionosphere (see, for example, Mozer\net al., 1980). The evolution of the corresponding ion-acoustic\ninstability leads to quasi-oscillations around the saturation\nlevel with time approximately reciprocal to the instability\ngrowth rate \u03c41 and subsequent fading (in time \u03c42 which is\n3\u201330 seconds for typical plasma parameters (Shalimov and\nLiperovsky, 1988; Pilipenko et al., 1999)). Consequent vari-\nations of anomalous conductivity result in pulsed electron\nprecipitation and aurora, as well as noise generation in the\nPi1B band.\nIt should be noted that, in principle, Pi1 bursts may be\ncaused by the excitation of an Ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n Resonator\n(IAR) with an impulse of FAC (Lysak, 1997). Preliminary\ntheoretical estimates (Pilipenko et al., 1999) and experimen-\ntal studies (Belyaev et al., 1999), however, show that the\nIAR resonance structure is very sensitive to energetic elec-\ntron precipitations which may mask and\/or prevent the reso-\nnance response of the ionosphere. In our data we may expect\nthe presence of strong precipitations in the course of sub-\nstorm development in association with the observed absorp-\ntion spikes. However, just during these spikes, the most in-\ntense Pi1 bursts are developed in close association with FAC\nand aurora. Therefore, at least a part of the Pi1 activity can\nbe associated with strong FAC development accompanied by\nquasi-oscillating anomalous resistivity.\n6 Appendix\nFor the estimation of FAC intensity, we followed the idea\nsuggested by Glassmeier and Heppner (1992) (see also Pili-\npenko et al., 1999). As a model of the current filament,\nthey exploited the azimuthally symmetric flux tube, having\na radius a, with an upward flowing FAC in the center and a\ndownward flowing current at the flanks. The magnetic field\nin the atmosphere can be described by a magnetic scalar po-\ntential 9(r, z) which obeys Laplace\u2019s equation. This poten-\ntial in the atmosphere (z > 0) may be chosen to coincide\nwith the potential of a point charge, \u22124pi90a, located at\nz = \u2212a. Thus, in cylindrical coordinates, the magnetic po-\ntential is 9(r, z) = 90(a\/\n\u221a\n(z+ a)2 + r2) at z > 0, where\n90 is the amplitude factor. Then the ground magnetic field,\nb = \u2212\u22079 |z=h, and the ionospheric FAC,\nj\u2016 = \u2212( 2\n\u00b50R\n)\u22072\u22a59 |z=0, (6)\nare easily calculated (Glassmeier and Heppner (1992)). Here,\nh is the height of the ionospheric layer, \u00b50 = 4pi \u00b7 10\u22127H\/m\nis the magnetic permeability, and R = 6H \/6P is the Hall\nto Pedersen conductance ratio. The vertical magnetic com-\nponent was chosen as a rough indicator of FAC intensity\nin the model. This component reaches its maximum value,\nbmaxz = (a\/(a + h)2)90, at the center of the current fil-\nament. This value for bmaxz is rarely measured. However,\nusing ground vertical magnetic component bz measurements\nand following the suggestion by Pilipenko et al. (1999) we\ncan obtain the amplitude factor 80\n80 = bz \u00b7 ((a + h)\n2 + r2)3\/2\na \u00b7 (a + h) , (7)\nfor the case where the current-carrying flux tube is not direct\nabove the magnetometer station. It was found that 80 is of\nthe order of 5 to 10 \u00b710\u22123T\u00b7m.\nThe FAC above the ionosphere\nj\u2016 =\n(\n290\n\u00b50R\n)(\na(2a2 \u2212 r2)\n(a2 + r2)5\/2\n)\n, (8)\nalso reaches its maximum value, jmax\u2016 = (490\/\u00b50R)(1\/a2),\nat r=0.\nAcknowledgement.
