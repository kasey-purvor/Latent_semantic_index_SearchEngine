This paper examines the implications of such a system for CAL, and presents two prototype\napplications that demonstrate the possibilities.\nIntroduction\nFor many years, almost since the dawn of computing, people have speculated about the\npaperless society. Each new technology is heralded as the one that will finally take us to\nthe fully electronic Utopia. However, the use of computers as document preparation tools\nhas actually increased the number of paper documents. The latest mass-market\ndevelopment, the Internet, is unlikely to buck this trend even though the tools used seem\nto encourage on-screen browsing. The problems inherent with screen presentation have\nnot gone away, while the amount of information available to the average computer user is\nincreasing all the time.\nEducation is no exception; students too are encouraged to create documents as part of\nmore active learning programmes, building an awareness of the importance of presenting\ntheir own ideas to others as well as helping to meet targets for the integration of\ntechnology into teaching. But CAL is about more than just having better tools to create\nmore attractive documents.\n6\nAir-J Volume 5 Number I\nThe arrival of multimedia-capable computers has provided an opportunity for the\nintegration of new media types into documents. These media types range from sound,\nvideo and typed text to fully interactive computational tools such as virtual worlds.\nHowever, multimedia technology has its problems:\n(i) video frame rates and resolution are often low;\n(ii) audio quality is often poor;\n(iii) text is hard to read from computer displays;\n(iv) the document must be viewed with a suitable computer.\nThese are problems of perception, rooted in our experience of existing single-medium\ndocuments. We have got used to broadcast video, CD audio, good-quality colour imaging\nand high-resolution text rendering. It seems likely that the advances being made in\nsoftware and hardware will fairly quickly remove the barriers presented by (i) and (ii)\nthrough better compression and more bandwidth. The typical display and speaker system\nof a modern multimedia PC are already good enough to deliver the fruits of these\nadvances. On the other hand, solutions to (iii) and (iv) do not appear to be just around\nthe corner. This threatens to divide multimedia documents into two types: those that are\ndelivered in a virtual world (by computer) and those that are delivered in the real world\n(by paper).\nThe typical solution to this division is to create a metaphor which reduces the gap\nbetween the real and virtual worlds - hence the desktop metaphor. Many CAL\nexperiments have involved placing material which is available to the student in printed\nform online in an attempt to take advantage of the added features that a computer text\ncan have - for example hypertext links and search engines for navigation - as well as\nusing this as the starting point for adding multimedia content to the original publication\nand linking it to computer-based instructional resources such as self-assessment engines.\nSee Rush (1995) for a recent example.\nDigitalDesk\nThe philosophy of the Origami project is that a significant improvement to this situation\ncan be made by using a human-computer interaction technique known as computer-\naugmented environments (Robinson, 1995) to allow publications which sit uneasily in the\ncomputer domain to have the best of both worlds. Rather than create virtual books, we\nseek to unite the value-added functionality of computer-based texts to real paper\ndocuments and ultimately to the student's working environment itself via the DigitalDesk\n(Wellner, 1991; Wellner, 1993).\nIn the 1970s, Xerox PARC developed the desktop metaphor which made computers\neasier for many people to use by making them look and act like ordinary physical desks.\nElectronic documents could be manipulated like paper documents, but the computer\nadded powerful new capabilities. Recently, a joint project between the Computer\nLaboratory at the University of Cambridge and Rank Xerox EuroPARC resulted in the\ndevelopment of BrightBoard (Stafford-Fraser and Robinson, 1996), a computer-aug-\nmented whiteboard, and prototype DigitalDesks (Wellner, 1994). Instead of making the\n7\nRobert Harding et a\\ New technology for interactive CAL the Origami project\nComputer\nActive paper\nDesk surface\nfigure \/: The DigitalDesk is built\naround an ordinary physical desk\nfigure 2: The anatomy of trie DigitalDesk\ncomputer act like a desk, the DigitalDesk makes the desk act like a computer. With a\nDigitalDesk, the user can do things with ordinary paper that normally can be done only\nwith electronic documents on a screen.\nThe DigitalDesk is built around an ordinary physical desk and can be used as such, but it\nhas extra capabilities. A video camera is mounted above the desk, pointing down at the\nwork surface. This camera's output is fed through a system that can detect where the user\nis pointing (using an LED-tipped pen) and it can recognize the documents that are placed\non it. The more advanced version also has a computer-driven projector mounted above\nthe desk enabling electronic objects to be projected onto real paper documents, thus\nremoving the burden of having to switch attention between screen and paper and\nallowing additional user-interaction techniques. It will be some time before such systems\nbecome widely available, but workstations with built-in support for video input have been\navailable for many years and have now even found their way into the personal computer\nmarket. \u2022\nThe techniques employed by the DigitalDesk take advantage of the fact that most written\nmaterials are already created in electronic form. Sadly, much of the richness of this form\nis thrown away when the document is printed, but the DigitalDesk attempts to utilize this\nextra information to augment the paper copy.\nEducational applications\nThe DigitalDesk is an ideal way to advance the computer-illustrated text (CIT) concept\n(Harding and Quinney, 1990) which sought to combine the strengths of the traditional\nprinted textbook with those of the computer as an educational medium. The earliest CITs\nwere printed books with software, the use of which was an integral part of the learning\nstrategy of the package as a whole. They covered subjects in mathematics, computing and\n8\nAa-j Volume 5 Number I\nphysics, areas where screen presentation is particularly difficult but where interactive\ngraphic displays and dynamic computation can considerably enhance the learning\nactivities. Of course, computers have come a long way since that series was published. The\nRenaissance project (Harding et al, 1995) experimented with electronic delivery but more\nrecently Calculus Connections (Harding and Quinney, 1995), which involves video-clips,\nsounds and sophisticated computer animation, is still centred on the printed course book.\nWhen graphical user-interfaces were first introduced to desktop computers they were\nprincipally aimed at document generation. In order to help the user transfer existing skills\nin handling paper documents to the computer, the desktop metaphor was invented. An\nintegral part of the resulting systems was the printer which allowed the user to transfer the\nfinished document back to the real world, throwing away properties (such as the ability to\nedit) which were no longer needed.\nAlthough document generation is an important part of educational computing, the real\nexplosion in computer use has come from the ability to interact with multiple media\ntypes, to gain access to information resources that exist outside the user's immediate\n'desktop', and to participate in new styles of communication. As before, real-world\nmetaphors have been applied in order to assist the use of these new applications.\nHowever, the problem with these new media types is that printing them causes them to\nlose properties which are still useful. The DigitalDesk is effective for these applications\nbecause its purpose is to retain these useful properties and, where possible, to add them to\ndocuments which were not even created on the computer.\nWorking prototypes\nTo illustrate the DigitalDesk's contribution, two illustrative scenarios are presented here.\nThese scenarios represent possible uses of software that has already been developed for\nthe DigitalDesk as part of the current Origami project. The first covers a broad range of\ncomputing applications and is used to set the scene for the second, an example aimed\nspecifically at education.\nAugmenting paper documents\nConsider a user at the DigitalDesk browsing the World Wide Web, with the current page\nprojected onto the desk surface in front of her. She selects links to follow by pointing with\na special 'active' pen and pressing a button located near the tip. Having discovered a page\nof interest, she uses the projected print button to create a hard-copy with all the familiar\nand desirable qualities of paper: readability, tactile sensation and portability. She takes\nthis paper copy away with her to read on the way home. The next day she returns to her\ndesk with the paper copy of the page she printed the day before, marked up with her own\nnotes. When she places it on the DigitalDesk it is recognized as the page that was printed\nthe day before, suitable browsing software is launched and the same set of buttons that\nare available when browsing the electronic version are projected onto the header of the\npaper version and the links automatically become active. She can then continue to work\nwith the document.\nComputer-aided assessment\nNow consider a mathematics student working with his course book at the DigitalDesk. The\nsoftware which accompanies the course book is automatically launched when the book is\n9\nRobert Harding et al New technology for interactive CAL the Origami project\nThe expresses ax* * tx* e. where a, b mi e ere conitntt. u caOed \u2022 q\nfunction of x- The bigheit power of the vtriifcle x ii the tecond.

During a section on curve-sketching, he reads about polynomials.\nThe generic equation of a quadratic polynomial is given with spaces for the values of the\ncoefficients and an empty box underneath for plotting the graph. The software projects\ndefault values and draws the graph into the box. However, it also projects controls\nalongside the coefficients to allow him to change these values while observing the\ncorresponding change in the graph (perhaps in response to a rhetorical question like: What\nhappens if you change c?) On the next page of his course book, he is faced with an\nassessment exercise. This time the polynomials are fixed and he must draw the curve into\nthe box (the active pen does of course have a real nib for writing). When he has finished, he\nclicks a projected button to ask the computer to assess his sketches. The sketches are\nanalysed for features such as maxima, minima and axis crossings, and marked accordingly.\nFuture developments\nHardware and software have already been developed to meet the requirements of the\nabove scenarios. For the future, the DigitalDesk provides exciting possibilities for the\ndevelopment of educational computing projects. However, it is a research project; it will\nbe some time before computer-augmented environments make their way onto the average\nlaboratory desktop. Ten years ago, the same could have been said for desktop video.\nIn the meantime, when designing applications, it is useful to break down the technology\ninto several levels of increasing technical sophistication:\n\u2022 printed materials only;\n\u2022 printed materials augmented by traditional tools such as pen and paper, hand\ncalculator, etc.;\n10\nALT-J Volume 5 Number )\n\u2022 printed materials augmented by a computer system (with keyboard and pointing\ndevice);\n\u2022 printed materials augmented by a computer system fitted with a page-recognition\ndevice (possibly driven by a hand-held device such as a simple bar-code reader);\n\u2022 printed materials augmented by a computer system with page recognition and a\npen\/finger-driven locator;\n\u2022 printed materials used in the context of the fully featured DigitalDesk with page\nrecognition, locator tracking and projection.\nMaterials that are flexible enough to be used at any of these levels would be useful even if\neveryone had access to a fully functional DigitalDesk, since there are bound to be times\nwhen the complete system is not available. By designing computer-aided software\npackages with this in mind, it is hoped that a greater continuity can be provided between\nthe student's experience in the computer laboratory and his or her own private time spent\nrevising and reflecting on the subject matter.\nAcknowledgements\nThe original DigitalDesk was built by Pierre Wellner, and BrightBoard by Quentin\nStafford-Fraser (1996), both research students sponsored by Rank Xerox in the\nComputer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.
