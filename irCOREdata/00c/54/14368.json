Up to\nthe 1980s, many educators who were keen to use computers to pass on knowledge\ndeveloped various computer-based teaching and training materials, but most of these\nmaterials were capable only of delivering information in text with perhaps some computer\ngraphics, and in many cases it proved difficult to raise learners' interest in the subject\nmatters (Patrick & Fitzgibbon, 1988). In the 1990s, there has been cheerful news for pro-\ncomputer educators; the latest multimedia technology could be the solution to the\nproblem. Using a multimedia personal computer we can retrieve information in diverse\nformats: text, high-quality audio, still and animated graphics, and still and moving\npictures.\nHowever, to understand how to teach people effectively with computers, it is first\nnecessary to find out what people want and what they expect from computer teaching and\ntraining materials. It would be foolhardy to produce a computer teaching\/training\nprogram and expect all users to learn things equally well. In fact, much past research has\nshown that people have different learning styles, and one's learning style is built up by\nmany different past experiences (Entwistle, 1987). Computer experience, and how the user\nfeels before and during looking at computerized material, may also affect learning style,\nand hence interactions with the computer.\nIdeally, every computerized teaching\/training program should have many versions in the\ns\nManfred Kwok and Cliffordpnes Catering for different learning styles\npresentation of information, covering all users' learning styles, computer experience,\nmood, etc. For example, one version may be a straightforward presentation, another\nversion may be fully interactive.\nThe problem of catering for different learning styles\nLearning styles\nIf we all accept the level of interactivity as being a key factor which affects how well and\nhow much learners learn from programmed materials, the immediate problems are to\nidentify what factors may affect learners' study styles, and to find out how to provide\noptimal computer interaction.\nThe notion of cognitive styles gained recognition in the 1950s and 1960s as a significant\npersonal characteristic which raised the understanding of how people learn. Cognitive\nstyle has been variously defined (Kogan, 1971; Messick, 1976). However the authors here\nwould define the term as the unique and preferred way in which an individual processes,\nstores and retrieves information. Study strategies are simply cognitive styles applied when\nindividuals go about learning. Messick defined as many as nine distinctive dimensions\n(Messick, 1970). Witkin's work on two different cognitive styles, called field-dependent\nand field-independent, showed the differences in the way an individual structures and\nanalyses information (Witkin, 1976). Pask and Scott (1972) and Pask (1976) distinguished\ntwo distinctive styles of learning, identified as holist and serialist strategies. Marton &\nS\u00e4lj\u00f6 (1976) identified two study approaches: deep approach and surface approach. Kolb\n(1984) defined four learning styles: accommodation, assimilation, divergence, and\nconvergence. All this produces a confusing picture of different learning styles, strategies\nand approaches. Clarke (1993) (together with the authors of this paper) suggests bravely\nthat these styles 'differ more in name than nature' and that they 'can be classified into\neither a preference for a reasonable degree of structure and guidance [serial] ... or a\npreference for considerable freedom to explore [holistic]'.\nLearning styles measurement\nOne problem is to find out users' learning styles. Some learning-style test procedures,\ninventories and questionnaires have been suggested for determining learning styles\neffectively and sufficiently, but these tests and questionnaires are mostly very time-\nconsuming to complete and\/or they may require instructors to assess their outcomes\n(Pask, 1973; Kolb, 1984; Weinstein et al, 1983). It would be highly impractical, perhaps\nsomewhat cruel, to ask users first to spend considerable time completing those tests or\nquestionnaires before using any computerized programs. What we want is a quick and\neasy, reliable and valid measure of style which occurs as an immediate prerequisite to\ninvolvement in the program, such that users can determine their own learning strategy\nand preferred navigation method within the system. A well-designed multimedia system,\ntogether with opportunities for multiple navigational strategies provided by a range of\nnavigational methods, will encourage users to adopt a 'best method' to suit their\nindividual study strategy. We will call such an approach to programs and presentations:\nfront-end applied programs orfront-end applied presentations.\n6\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nExperimental study with front-end applied multimedia\npresentations\nComputerized front-end\nThe front-end of multimedia presentations contains 13 items suggested by Clarke (1993)\ntaken from Ford's original 18-item Study Preference Questionnaire (SPQ) (Ford, 1985).\nThis gave us an opportunity to test the effectiveness of Clarke's refinement made to the\nSPQ. Subjects rated each item on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly agree with the holistic\nstatement) to 5 (strongly agree with the serial statement). Figure 1 shows the first screen\nof the front-end. The program then sums the scores for all questions. The maximum\npossible front-end score is 65; this would be obtained only if someone strongly agreed\nwith all thirteen serial statements. Initially, the boundary between the two learning styles\nwas set at 39.5, the mid-point between highest and lowest possible scores. The front-end\nalso asks for some more details of the users (name, age and sex) as well as their past\ncomputer experience and how they feel prior to operating certain presentations.\nSurriaiti\u00eb:\nEBMS - User Details \u2022 Front End Application\nFirst initial:\nHow Do You Feel At This Moment: Nervous< O O G O O >Ve\u00bbyrelaxed\n:;\u00c7pmpaterExpenence;;::;|;;;::;.;..::;;:^ ::;..::v\nspt\u00e8fcse'anwerthofoUoWiflgj^\nthe appropriate answer according to your own preference.: P'ress'the ; ;\u2022 '\n'Next Question' button to see the next question.

Within\nthe overall sample, thirty-four were female and twenty-four were male, reflecting the\nproportion of sexes in the Business School. All were volunteers and had all received at\nleast two hours of training on operating personal computers and Microsoft's Windows.\n7\nManfred Kwok and Cliffordpnes Catering for different teaming styles\nMaterials\nThe materials used in the study were taken from the multimedia information presenta-\ntions called the European Business Management School Visual Prospectus (EBMSVP)\nwhich was developed by one of the authors (MK) as a by-product of this research. The\nsystem includes a wide range of information about the European Business Management\nSchool and general information about Swansea and the University. It has three operation\nmodes: self-running, menu driven, and fully interactive. As its name suggests, the self-\nrunning mode will run without interaction from users, but they may interrupt the system\nby pressing the Fast Forward paging button. The menu-driven mode allows users to\nchoose what they want to see from the menus and then to page through the topic forward\nor backward by using appropriate buttons on the screen. The fully interactive mode\nincreases the freedom of travelling around the system, and allows users to jump from\nmenu to menu, and from one topic to another. They can also make use of the index\nfacility quickly to look up any particular topic within the system. Such an index facility\ndoes not exist in the other two modes.\nHowever, considering the testing time and the number of students who could be asked to\ntake part in the project, the content of the testing materials has been made general. In the\nactual study, only two versions, menu driven and fully interactive, were used.\nResults\nOf the 58 students, 30 students (51.7%) were classified as having a holistic learning style,\nand 28 students (48.3%) as having a serial learning style. They were assigned randomly to\neither the fully interactive version or the menu-driven version; 31 students (53.4%) used\nthe version which matched their learning styles, and 27 students (46.6%) did not.\nWe applied a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness of Fit Test to test the normality of both\nsets of data. The significant figures were p=0.7717 and p=0.3201, hence we had no\nevidence to say that both sets of data were not normally distributed. The mean\nperformance scores for matched and mismatched groups were 11.58 (SD=3.69) and 10.22\n(SD=3.62) respectively. Our initial assumption was that if we were using the improved\nversion of the original 18-item SPQ and we also used the correct boundary (i.e. 39.5) to\ndivide students into ywo groups based on learning styles, we expected to see the mean\nscore of the matched cases significantly greater than the mismatched cases. T-test for two\nindependent samples was applied to compare their mean performances. Unfortunately,\nthe test result was insignificant (at the 5% level), the one-tailed significance figure was\np=0.082. In other words, our 13-item front-end failed to detect and provide a suitable\npresentation for users who have different learning styles. Perhaps 39.5 was not the correct\nboundary. We reclassified all 58 cases with the mean front-end score 37.31, 29 of each\nwere in the matching and mismatching categories. By comparing the mean scores of the\ntwo categories, we found a significant answer (p=0.047). We also attempted to apply a\nsingle item - item 7 of the original SPQ - to define subjects' learning strategies as\noriginally suggested by Clarke (1993). This gave 19 matched cases and 34 mismatched\ncases, and their mean performance scores were 10.63 (SD=4.06) and 10.79 (SD=3.46)\nrespectively. (Note: the mismatched group has a slightly higher mean score). Five cases\n8\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nwere ignored, since those subjects expressed no clear preference for either statement of the\nitem 7.\nA follow-up questionnaire was used to collect users' opinions on the front-end applied\nmultimedia presentation, and answers were included in an exploratory factor analysis to\nassess the dimensionality of the learning style determination. This resulted in five factors,\nand crossloading situations also existed. After a reliability analysis, six items were\nremoved. The remaining seven items proved to have a better degree of internal\nconsistency, with reliability coefficient alpha value reaching 0.7086 from the initial alpha\nvalue 0.5799 (it has been suggested that a minimum alpha value of 0.90 should be\nachieved to have a reliable measure - Nunnally, 1967). We then carried out the analysis\nby assessing our subjects only with the seven items of the front-end. Disappointing results\nwere again found. Although the average performance of the matching group (11.61) was\nhigher than the average performance of the mismatching group (10.08), there was no\nevidence that this difference was significant statistically (p=0,0595, p>0.05). There was\none possible explanation for this failure to find significant differences on the students'\nstudy performances despite using the more reliable seven items of the front-end only. We\nmight have a substantial number of students who were capable of performing equally well\nwith different levels of interactivity of computer presentation. These were described by\nPask (1976) as versatile learners, and their front-end scores would have dominated the\ncentral area of the distribution. Therefore, we excluded students from around the mean\nscore of the distribution with the hope that these seven items of the front-end could\nefficiently detect extreme cases. Nine different factors were used to assess signifiant\ndifferences between matched and mismatched cases (see Table 1).\nTable 1: Meanings\nVariable Name\nPERFORM\nANXIETY1\nEASYBUT\nEASYOP\nLOST\nTEACHER\nTEXTSYS\nOVERALL\nTIME\nofvariables\nMeaning\nstudy performance\nanxiety during the presentation\nhow easy to understand those on screen buttons\nhow easy to operate the presentation\nsense of position of the presentation\nhow do they like multimedia presentations compared with conventional\nlectures\nhow do they like multimedia presentations compared with text-based\ncomputer presentations\noverall opinion on multimedia presentations\ntime spent on the presentation\nAt this stage, close to half of our overall sample, 48.28%, were excluded from the centre of\nthe front-end distribution.

There were disagreements between\nboth studies. Work should therefore be done once again on Ford's original 18-item Study\nPreference Questionnaire covering more variety of subject matters.\nThere were two possible factors which could affect our test results:\n\u2022 the correct use of cut-off point of the front-end scores;\n\u2022 the validity of the 13-item front-end.\nHowever, the results suggest that the learners who really need guidance in selecting an\nappropriate navigation method in order to raise their interest in the material, i.e. those at\nthe extremes of learning styles, can be helped.\nReferences\nClarke, J.
