Its several schools all adopt a \nheterodox account of capital accumulation and emphasise the latter's socially \nembedded, socially regularized nature. They focus on the historically contingent \nensembles of complementary economic and extra-economic mechanisms and practices \nwhich enable relatively stable accumulation to occur over relatively long periods despite \nthe fundamental contradictions, crisis-tendencies, and conflicts generated by capitalism \n(on different schools, see Jessop 1990). These ideas have been applied most famously \nto 'Fordism' and 'post-Fordism' and extensive interest therein from the mid-80s to mid-\n90s certainly contributed to the RA's popularity. But even the initial Parisian work \naddressed other topics and subsequent work has seen  a real deepening and widening \nof the regulation approach far beyond issues of Fordism and\/or post-Fordism. \n \nThese more recent trends are my primary concern below. Since a short survey cannot \ncover all relevant material, I will provide a general account of the RA's successive \ngenerations and developmental trajectories. I then illustrate this account by reviewing \nthe Parisian 'state of the art' and the theoretical innovations introduced by other \ntheorists. I also consider the RA's responses to the failure of its initial alternative \neconomic strategy (due, it should be noted, to lack of adoption rather than subsequent \nimplementation failure) and its relative isolation within mainstream economics; and I \nalso examine how the RA's message has been received and understood outside the \ndiscipline of economics. I conclude by asking whether the twenty years of research, \nscholarship, and exposition invested in the RA have been worth the effort (the standard \nRA survey is Boyer 1990; on more recent work, see also Boyer and Saillard 1995a). \n \nI - Genesis and Agenda of the Regulation Approach \n \nThe RA is sometimes mistakenly identified solely with the Parisian \u00e9cole de la r\u00e9gulation \nof economists such as Aglietta, Boyer, and Lipietz. Its very first work began circulating \nin 1974, was published in modified form in 1976, and translated into English in 1979 \n(Aglietta 1974, 1979). Parisian output has since continued unabated. It has been taken \nup in various disciplines. Many scholars now employ such core Parisian concepts as \n'accumulation regime' (hereafter 'AR') and 'mode of regulation' (hereafter MoR) or at \nleast refer to purportedly regulationist notions such as (post-)Fordism. Other regulation \n'schools' do exist, of course; but they have been far less influential. Thus, at the risk of \nperpetuating this fallacious reduction of regulationism to the the Parisian school, it is the \nlatter which is the main focus of my article. \n \nThis school initially comprised a group of 'polytechnicians' connected to the state \nplanning apparatus rather than directly employed in the academic world. As \nprofessional economists, its members were theoretically inspired by radical economics \n(notably Marx, Keynes, Kalecki); as 'soixante-huitards', i.e., intellectuals shaped by May \n1968, they were ideologically sympathic to the organized working class and the radical \npolitics of communist, maoist, or extreme left currents; and, as technocratic policy \nadvisers within the state itself, their avowed preference was for an economic and social \nmodernisation based on socialist planning, democratic participation, and progressive \nclass compromise. The starting point for the regulationist agenda was a critique of neo-\nclassical economics and structural marxism in the light of the emerging economic crisis \nof the mid-1970s. They hoped thereby to prepare the ground for an alternative account \nof Atlantic Fordism, its economic crisis, and the impasse of state planning and \nKeynesian welfarism. This theoretical agenda found its political expression in an \nalternative economic strategy for France that could be pursued by a relatively \nautonomous state to promote a new class compromise and new structural forms and \nnorms of production and consumption appropriate to the new economic circumstances \n(Dosse 1992a: 201-2; 1992b: 334-348; Aglietta 1994; Coriat 1994; Lipietz 1993, 1994; \nVercellone 1994). Given its importance for assessing the achievements of the original \nregulationist project, I now present this two-pronged critique. \n \nOn the first front, as a heterodox minority, the Parisian regulationists hoped to persuade \nthe majority of their fellow economists in France (and elsewhere) that orthodox \neconomics did not understand how real economies operated. They criticized it on three \nmain grounds. They rejected its key assumption that there is a clearly delimited, socially \ndisembedded sphere of economic relations with a tendency toward general equilibrium. \nThey denied that this sphere's rationality and dynamic can be adequately analyzed in \nthe first instance (if not, indeed, entirely) in terms of pure exchange relations in perfect \nmarkets. And they disputed that exchange relations are entirely driven by the \noptimizing, economizing behaviour of pre-constituted rational individuals with pre-given \nand stable preference functions who then orient their actions exclusively to the price \nmechanism. \n \nAgainst these ideas, regulationists suggested that economic relations were always \nsocially embedded. This does not exclude analyses of economic forms, such as the \nwage-relation or price mechanism; it does require putting them in their social context. \nThus Aglietta, the pioneer regulationist, proposed 'a theory of social regulation (as) a \ncomplete alternative to the theory of general equilibrium' (1979: 13). In turn he \nsuggested studying regulation in terms of 'the transformation of social relations as it \ncreates new forms that are both economic and non-economic, that are organized in \nstructures and themselves reproduce a determinant structure, the mode of production' \n(1979: 13, 16). Regulationists also rejected the neo-classical views that time could be \nsafely discounted or ignored2 and that any temporal development is essentially \nreversible.3 Instead, they argued that economic development is largely path-dependent \nand irreversible. They added, against the orthodoxy, that economic, political, and social \ninstitutions matter and should therefore be seen as endogenous economic factors.4 For \nthey shape economic subjects, differentiate modes of production, and modify \ncapitalism's dynamic, crisis-tendencies, and temporalities. They should certainly not be \nseen as wholly exogenous sources of rigidity and disturbance for a socially \ndisembedded market economy that would otherwise function perfectly -- which, if true, \nwould, of course, justify neo-liberal calls for a return to a golden (but mythical) laissez-\nfaire past. And, third, in place of an atomistic and trans-historical homo economicus, \nthey focused on shared and changing norms of production and consumption and \nchanging modes of economic calculation. This is shown in their concerns with the \ndiffusion of norms of mass production and consumption in establishing the Atlantic \nFordist model and with post-Fordist struggles over flexibility. \n \nOn the second front, Parisian regulationists criticized 'structural Marxism' for providing a \nwholly inadequate account of capitalism. Whilst retaining the key Althusserian ideas that \nthe capitalist mode of production (or CMP) had relatively autonomous economic, \npolitical, and ideological regions and that accumulation was 'overdetermined' by their \ncomplex articulation, they also offered three main criticisms. First, they rejected the \nstructuralist account of the quasi-automatic reproduction of the CMP. Althusser had \nsuggested that, because of the determining role of the economic 'in the last instance', \ncapitalist reproduction was almost guaranteed once the CMP was consolidated  \n(Althusser and Balibar 1977). This largely philosophical argument, without firm \nfoundations in Marx's own work, implied that capitalist relations of production were \nreproduced 'behind the backs of the producers' regardless of the intentions or actions of \neconomic agents. Opposing this mechanistic account, regulationists stressed the \nimprobability of capitalist reproduction and examined the changing conditions which \nallowed production and consumption in different stages of capitalism to be combined \ntemporarily into a virtuous circle of accumulation. They also aimed to bring subjects \nback into the picture. They denied economic agents were merely passive 'supports' \n(Tr\u00e4ger) of social relations of production and, instead, examined the social processes \nand struggles which defined and stabilized modes of economic calculation and norms of \neconomic conduct. Indeed, without taking account of the subjects who acted as bearers \nof structures, it was virtually impossible to theorize how contradictions could ever be \neven temporarily stabilized (cf. Lipietz 1973). \n \nThey argued, secondly, that institutions matter and change over time. Whereas \nstructural marxism tended to see capitalism as eternal and unchanging, regulationists \nsaw it as crisis-prone and discontinuous. It occurs in stages, each with its own \ndistinctive institutional framework and crisis-tendencies; and, far from being guaranteed, \nthe transition between stages depends on chance discoveries and is always mediated \nby open-ended class struggles. Thirdly, regulationists distinguished between the overall \nlogic of the capital relation and its structural forms, on the one hand, and, on the other \nhand, the strategies deployed by particular social forces (cf. Boyer 1990: 32; Dosse \n1992b: 340-1). This is especially clear in their emphasis on the wage relation \nunderstood in broad terms (rapport salarial) and, in this context, regulationists stressed \nthe changing forms and modalities of economic class struggle. \n \nThese battles involve an attack on two wings of the same theoretical enemy. For, \ndespite marked differences between orthodox economics and structural marxism, they \nboth offer an essentially static and essentialist account of the (capitalist) economy and \nits inertia. Regulationists highlighted the antagonisms, contradictions, and crises \ngenerated by capitalism and how it developed discontinuously in and through class \nstruggle. Thus, to the mechanistic accounts of reproduction offered by neo-classical \neconomics and structural marxism, Aglietta and his colleagues counterposed the \ndynamic concept of r\u00e9gulation. This notion emphasizes the historically contingent \neconomic and extra-economic mechanisms which lead economic agents to act in \nspecific circumstances in accordance with the unevenly changing, objective \nrequirements of capitalist reproduction. \n \nIn discussing regulation, the RA distinguishes the roles of market and non-market \nforces. It goes well beyond the narrow concerns of orthodox economics with production \nfunctions, economizing behaviour, and pure market forces. It considers a wide range of \ninstitutional factors and social forces directly and indirectly involved in accumulation. In \nparticular, whilst far from forgetful about the essentially anarchic role of exchange \nrelations (market forces) in mediating capitalist reproduction, the RA stresses the \ncomplementary functions of other mechanisms (institutions, norms, conventions, \nnetworks, procedures, and modes of calculation) in structuring, facilitating, and guiding \n(in short, 'regulating') accumulation. Conversely, in contrast to structural marxism, \nwhich, for all its rhetorical insistence on 'economic determination in the last instance', \ndisplayed little interest in the precise mechanisms which allegedly guaranteed this \nultimately determining role, the pioneering regulationists took economic forms and \ninstitutions very seriously. Thus, in conducting this battle on two fronts, the RA began \nthe task of integrating radical political economy with analyses of the state and civil \nsociety to show how economic and extra-economic factors interact to stabilize the \ncapital relation. In short, they were equally concerned with the economic (market-\nmediated) mode of economic regulation and 'the social (or extra-economic) modes of \neconomic regulation'. \n \nII - Regenerating the Regulation Approach \n \nThe RA has since diffused widely and undergone several theoretical changes. These \ncan be analysed in terms of successive generations. This possibility was mooted by \nBoyer (1990a, 1990b) when he called for a 'second generation' of studies. Generation \ndoes not refer here to different intellectual cohorts with distinct memberships, however, \nas with the first, second, and third generations of Frankfurt Critical Theory. Instead it \nrefers to successive steps in a developing research paradigm taken by a growing and \nchanging band of regulationists. Some 'first-generation' Parisian analysts have \nadvanced second- and third-generation research; others have moved away from the RA \nproblematic in part or in whole. Conversely, whilst some more recent recruits have \nhelped widen and deepen the RA agenda, others are still working happily with first \ngeneration notions. This complicates attempts to distinguish generations in simple \nchronological terms. It does not exclude a more complex analysis in terms of uneven \ndevelopment in the RA, its cross-fertilization with other disciplines, and the role of \nchanging economic and\/or political circumstances in France as these have shaped the \nRA agenda theoretically as well as in terms of alternative economic policies and political \nstrategies. \n \nAdopting these criteria, one can distinguish three kinds of theoretical shift in the RA. \nThese comprise: simple, incremental empirical extensions of the RA to new research \nareas -- notably to national economies other than the USA and France, to micro- and \nmeso-level analyses of sectors and branches rather than the staying at the macro-level, \nand to various spatial scales below or above the national; a more complex, progressive \nconceptual deepening of the RA's account of already established regulationist topics \nthrough more detailed concern with their concrete and complex mediation, \noverdetermination, and instantiation; and ruptural theoretical redefinitions of older \nthemes which break with earlier RA work by undermining its previously unquestioned \nassumptions, concepts, and arguments. Stepwise expansion and deepening5 is closely \nlinked to the later work of the first generation, as seen in studies by Aglietta, Boyer, \nDelorme, Lipietz, and Mistral, or more senior second generation recruits, such as Coriat. \nDiscontinuous redefinition more often marks the input of new waves of theorists (e.g., \ngeographers, state theorists, discourse analysts, feminists) as they link -- and rethink -- \nregulationist ideas, concepts, and arguments with their own prior and emerging \nconcerns. \n \nThese patterns are combined in different ways. In state theory, for example, first \ngeneration RA studies largely neglected the state; second generation work introduced \nextant state concepts into the RA without considering their complementarity with basic \nregulationist arguments; and a third generation has begun to develop a coherent and \nexplicitly regulationist view of the state and integrate it into the RA (see below). \nRegarding space and locality, however, whereas some first generation scholars took \nthese issues seriously (notably Aglietta and Lipietz), second generation work tended to \ntreat the national economy and national state as the principal (and taken-for-granted) \nspace of regulation. This lapse could be due to the actual primacy of the national \neconomies and states under Atlantic Fordism -- which is the focus of so much \nregulationist analysis. Only recently has a third generation re-discovered spatial \nvariation, attempted to explore micro-macro problems, and asked how 'space' and \n'scale' come to be produced and reproduced in and through regulation and governance. \nA third trajectory appears in attempts by discourse theorists to deconstruct basic RA \nconcepts in order to rescue the overall approach from essentialism and class \nreductionism and connect it to studies of economic hegemony and domination. \n \nThe most significant examples of incremental extension occur in the work of Robert \nBoyer, the current doyen of the Parisian school. Whilst remaining committed to the core \nconcepts of the original approach, Boyer has been its most active and prolific developer. \nHis theoretical and empirical research concerns a wide range of substantive issues, \nranging across different levels of analysis from micro to macro, covering different spatial \nscales, dealing with various historical and prospective as well as current issues, \nadopting methods ranging from econometrics through game theory and institutionalism \nto scenario analysis, and studying not only a wide range of advanced capitalist \neconomies but also various socialist and post-socialist economies from the former \nSoviet bloc. In engaging in such a wide-ranging intellectual project, Boyer has extended \nthe RA in many ways. He has shown how it can be used to analyze specific sectors, the \nspecificities of Japanese capitalism, the origins of the grand crisis in the Soviet bloc, \ndevelopments in the Fordist wage relation, the effects of technological change, \nproblems of economic governance, alternative post-Fordist scenarios, the emergence of \neconomic conventions, and much else besides. At the same time, and not by accident, \nBoyer has creatively drawn on assumptions, concepts, and hypotheses from other \napproaches. These include the 'new French social sciences' (Wagner 1994), rational \nchoice and transaction cost analyses, work on governance, institutionalism, and \ncomparative political economy. In skillfully linking these with the RA, he has also \ncontributed to its progressive deepening. \n \nAlongside this partial appropriation by Parisian regulationists of other approaches, \nprogressive deepening of the RA more generally has been advanced by its \nappropriation and transformation in turn by scholars located beyond both heterodox and \nmainstream economics. Taking seriously the RA's potential to shed new light on their \nown disciplinary concerns, they have articulated it with their own conceptual frameworks \nand expertise. They have explored the concrete and complex mediation of structural \nforms and modes of economic regulation; studied how they come to be overdetermined \nby, and structurally coupled to, other institutional orders and\/or the wider 'lifeworld'; and \nexamined how MoRs are instantiated in specific contexts. This is especially important, \nas indicated above, in furthering the RA's role outside economics. For, even with its \nmuch expanded definition of the economy (to include accumulation regimes and their \nsocial and economic modes of regulation) and its commitment to institutional and \nevolutionary analysis, the Parisian RA itself remains firmly rooted in the discipline of \neconomics. Its 'totalizing' perspective is capital accumulation understood in broad terms. \nIt therefore lacks many central concepts for dealing with other institutional orders (such \nas the state, law, science, technology, education, the military, and the mass media) and \nwith the social dynamics of civil society, the public sphere, the politics of identities and \nsocial movements, and the lifeworld. This deficit has created the basis for non-\neconomists to explore the overdetermination of r\u00e9gulation by extra-economic factors as \nwell as to examine how regulation of capitalism impacts upon other parts of the social \nformation. \n \nFinally, if incremental extension and progressive deepening operate primarily through \nlinking RA concepts to complementary concepts from other disciplines, ruptural \nredefinition occurs when other approaches are used to deconstruct core concepts from \nthe RA instrumentarium to enhance its overall analytical and explanatory potential. This \nthird mode of theoretical development is most evident in the discourse analytic critique \nof basic concepts such as AR (cf. Scherrer 1995; Torfing 1997) or economic agency (cf. \nJenson 1990, 1995). And, in admittedly more limited ways, the same trend has occurred \nin the RA itself as some Parisians seek to develop more solid micro-foundations in \nresponse to the counter-attack from mainstream economics, rational choice theories, \nand the analysis of economic conventions. In doing so, however, they appear to be \nabandoning, at least for some purposes, some of the core radical assumptions of the \noriginal RA with its stress on the antagonistic nature of the capital-labour relation and \nthe inevitability of class struggle (cf. Coriat 1994; Lipietz 1993, 1994, 1995b; for an \nextended discussion, see Jessop 1997a). \n \nAn alternative account of RA generations can be constructed if one examines the \nimpact of the changing economic and political conjuncture in which the Parisian school \nhas operated. The first generation of work was shaped by the emerging crisis of \nFordism, the attempt to understand its specificities, and the formulation of an alternative \neconomic strategy to introduce a 'New Deal for post-Fordism'.6 The victory of the Union \nde la Gauche in the 1981 French elections created the opportunity for certain regulation \ntheorists (notably Aglietta, Boyer, Coriat, Lipietz, and Mistral) to become, at the request \nof Jacques Attali, advisers to the Socialist government. They hoped that this victory \nsignified a shift in the balance of forces within the state as well in the wider society and \nthat this would enable the state to promote a new institutionalized compromise around a \nstrategy of an 'offensive flexibility' for labour rather than capital. But their advice was \nrejected. At first the Socialist regime pursued old-style Keynesianism in one country (a \nreturn to an already exhausted mode of regulation) together with a more productivist \nrestructuring programme to make French industry more competitive based on \ntechnological modernization (without taking account of the need to refound the wage \nrelation). When the Keynesian approach failed (as the Parisian RA predicted), the \ngovernment adopted a neo-liberal programme of austerity and 'defensive flexibility' (a \nreturn, according to these regulationists, to the economic policies that produced the \ndepression of the 1930s). In addition to the government's rejection of the regulationist \nstrategy, the Parisian school was also rebuffed by organized business and a divided \nlabour movement. \n \nThis prompted a reorientation of the Parisian RA which is reflected in its above-\nmentioned incremental extension and progressive deepening. Vercellone (1994) sees \nthe neo-liberal turn as a decisive turning point in the work of the Parisian RA. It marked \nthe exhaustion of its initial political project, precipitated the erosion of its political \ncohesion as its members turned to different political strategies, and encouraged a \ntheoretical as well as political division between those RA scholars who continued to \nexplore the role of institutionalized class compromises in regulation (including those \nhoping that to find a new compromise as the basis for a progressive post-Fordism) and \nthose scholars who sought alternative micro-foundations for the regulation approach \n(and so began to move away from a concern with issues of class struggle) (Vercellone \n1994: 6, 24-28). There is some merit in this claim and it is confirmed by several leading \nmembers of the Parisian school. But one should not exaggerate the extent of the \ncleavage thereby introduced. For some leading scholars can be found on both sides of \nthe divide and even those who opt for one side or the other still identify with the school \nas a whole. Nonetheless this division is reflected in the different trajectories of certain \nfirst generation theorists. For example, Aglietta extended and deepened his existing \ninterest in the international constraints on national modes of regulation, became more \nand more interested in problems of money, and advocated development of a European \neconomic space as the basis of re-regulation; conversely, Lipietz's initial response was \nmore nationalist and anti-European, he later turned towards the green movement and \npolitical ecology, and now favours a European-wide solution to the continuing crisis. \nThese differences also reflect the changing strategic context beyond France in which \nthe RA agenda was developing theoretically as well as politically. For, as Coriat (1994: \n131-3) notes, the 1980s saw the emerging hegemony of Anglo-American neo-liberalism, \na re-shaping of the international economic hierarchy (especially with the growing \nsignificance of Japan with its own distinctive accumulation regime and mode of \nregulation), and new economic phenomena associated with the neo-liberal strategy of \ndefensive flexibility. The extension of the RA to include the third world, post-socialism, \nand the newly industrializing economies of East Asia is a further reflection of this \nbroader shift (see also Lipietz 1987, 1994). \n \nIII - The State of the Art in the RA \n \nHaving identified three ways in which, whilst maintaining broad commitment to its initial \nresearch programme, the RA may have changed, I will now examine the regulationist \n'state of the art'. To simplify this gargantuan task, I will first summarize some emergent \nthemes in the recent handbook edited by Boyer and Saillard (1995a), which explicitly \nsets out to present the current state of knowledge from a Parisian viewpoint. This \nstrategem is justified by the comprehensiveness of this veritable RA encyclopaedia, \nwhich comprises 54 chapters extending over 568 pages and includes contributions from \n36 French social scientists (mostly economists) and historians working directly or in \nsympathy with the Parisian school. I will then note some theoretical innovations \nassociated with other analysts who acknowledge an affiliation to the Parisian school. \nThe choice of analysts and topics for the second part of this examination lacks the same \nimprimatur as the first part but it should serve to illustrate the range of highly innovative \nwork being done outside the Parisian core -- much of which was ignored in Boyer and \nSaillard's more Francocentric conspectus. \n \nA Parisian View of the State of Knowledge \n \nIncremental extension and progressive deepening of Parisian RA are especially clear in \nthe chapters of Boyer and Saillard (1995a). In their own review of twenty years' work, \nthe editors often refer to the extension of the original RA to take account of national \nvariations and\/or more recent developments in the still unresolved crisis of Atlantic \nFordism (Boyer and Saillard 1995c). But they also identify other shifts. To illustrate this I \nwill note changes in the analysis of accumulation regimes and modes of regulation and \nthen consider each of the structural forms of the 'mode of regulation' -- defined by Boyer \n(1990) as the wage relation, the money form, competition, the state, and international \nregimes. \n \nAccumulation Regimes: having initally posited a three-stage, crisis-mediated succession \nof ARs (ancien r\u00e9gime, extensive or liberal, and intensive or monopoly) and been \nuncertain about the character of a fourth stage (neo- vs post-Fordism), the Parisian \nschool has since identified a wide range of accumulation regimes, accepted that they no \nlonger fit into a neat unilinear pattern, and shown how they vary across time and space. \nIn their guise as economists, the Parisians have also conducted statistical analyses and \neconometric modelling of ARs at the macro-economic and sectoral levels. More recent \nwork also shows much interest in the diverse sources of technological change that \ndestabilize (and provoke transformations) in ARs; and in the diverse ways in which they \nare inserted into the international division of labour (e.g., rentier regimes, bloody \nTaylorism, peripheral Fordism, small open economies, newly industrializing economies, \npost-socialist economies). The approach has also been creatively extended to socialist \nsocieties, their crises, and the problematic transition to capitalism (Andreff 1993; \nChavance 1994; Boyer 1995c). There has been growing interest in what one might call \nthe co-constitution of ARs and MoRs through comparative analysis of the articulation \nbetween the wage relation (and also other aspects of the MoR or institutionalized \ncompromises) and different regimes of accumulation (e.g., flexi-fordism in Germany, \nflawed fordism in the UK, the Japanese model). Finally, as it becomes increasingly \nevident that the crisis of Fordism remains unresolved and ready assumptions about the \npost-Fordist future have been dashed, there has been more nuanced work on \nalternative post-Fordist scenarios in an era marked by globalization and regionalization. \n \nModes of Regulation: from an initial concern with the structured coherence of regulation \nin essentially national accumulation regimes, the Parisian RA has extended its research \nagenda to include specific sectors (e.g., agriculture, services), different branches (cars, \nconstruction, finance), and sub- and\/or supra-national regions (rural, urban, European). \nThis is linked in turn to interest in the governance as well as regulation of sectors, \nbranches, and spatial scales. The Parisian school has also worked on the loss of \ncoherence of national MoRs under the impact of internationalization, financialization, \ntertiarization, technological change, expansion of the informal sector, etc.. It has \nattempted to formalize the analysis of structural forms, institutions, and regulation \nand\/or provide it with more solid micro-foundations. And work on post-Fordist scenarios \nhas been associated with work on alternative modes of regulation based on \ncomparative studies as well as modelling and scenario analyses. \n \nDifferent structural forms have also received attention. The money form and wage \nrelation were the two key starting points for the Parisian RA (Aglietta 1974). Money was \ninitially seen as a fictitious commodity, taking different forms in different periods and so \ntransforming the dynamic of accumulation; the distinctive stagflationary crisis of Fordism \nwas traced in turn to the role of credit money in this AR and its articulation to the Fordist \nwage relation (collective bargaining, Keynesianism, collective consumption, and social \nsecurity). Aglietta's subsequent work placed yet more emphasis on the central role of \nthe money form (albeit no longer seen in Marxist value-theoretical terms) and on the \nincompressibility of the wage form in modern society (which he characterized as a \n'soci\u00e9te salariale'). He has developed a regulationist account of the duality of money as \na structural form expressed in the contradiction between its roles as a national money \nand international currency. Whereas the former role is characterized by a unicit\u00e9 \n(unicity) linked to sovereign national states, the latter involves the plurality and anarchy \nof currency markets. This contradiction could be reconciled for a time in and through the \nemergence of one national money as the hegemonic international currency in pluri-\nnational currency blocs or world capitalism as a whole (Aglietta 1986). Lipietz has also \nundertaken important work on money but from a more value-theoretical viewpoint. He \nhas studied money's role in mediating the 'esoteric' world of value and the 'exoteric' \nworld of everyday economic life and has investigated the inflationary potential of the \npseudo-validation of credit money during the Fordist period (Lipietz 1985). More \ngenerally, with the increased importance of internationalization, there has also been RA \nwork on the subordination of money to financial arbitrage, the role of neo-liberalism in \nre-introducing constraints on inflationary tendencies, and the implications of monetarism \nfor the wage relation. \n \nRegarding the wage relation itself, the Parisian RA has shifted focus from the \ncorrespondence between different forms of wage relation and accumulation regimes \n(especially between the Fordist wage relation in its heyday and the nature of \nmonopolistic regulation) to the nature of sectoral variations, national variations, new \nforms of wage relation, new forms of social wage, and the re-segmentation of the \nlabour-force after the collapse of the Fordist compromise. There has been growing \ninterest in the social origins of wage relations and how they come to be institutionalized \nin different historical periods and\/or different sectors and branches. This is consistent \nwith the RA concern with the micro-regularities that form the basis for accumulation and \nregulation. Unsurprisingly, current work also focuses on alternative post-Fordist wage \nrelations at the micro- and macro-levels and their potential contribution to the re-\nstabilization of capitalism and\/or the passage to a greener, more sustainable mode of \ndevelopment. \n \nModes of competition: attention has turned from the oligopolistic competition linked to \nlarge firms and financial concentration characteristic of Fordist regulation to the impact \nof internationalization and the differentiation of products. There is now greater \nrecognition of the variety of forms of inter-firm, inter-regional, and inter-national \ncompetition; the impact of vertical and horizontal integration, new forms of quasi-\nintegration (such as strategic alliances and networks), and the emerging role of \ngovernance mechanisms other than market and hierarchy. \n \nState and International Regimes: from the outset the state and international regimes \nwere included among the basic structural forms in any MoR. The state was ascribed \nthree key roles in this regard: guaranteeing certain economic and extra-economic \npreconditions for the profitable operation of capital; securing the economic and extra-\neconomic conditions for reproducing labour-power; and coordinating global flows of \ncapital with national labour markets and addressing the resulting contradictions. The \nmanner in which it served these functions and undertook specific economic policies was \noften seen as politically overdetermined by its 'relatively autonomous' role as a specific \nexpression of institutionalized compromises. In this sense, then, the state, too, should \nbe seen as socially embedded; it was not reducible to a rational planner nor to an \ninstrument of monopoly capital. Its role in responding to the crisis of Fordism was to \nfashion a new institutionalized compromise that would underpin a new and dynamic \n'structured coherence' between the emerging accumulation regime and its mode of \nregulation. International regimes were likewise seen as stabilizing relations between \ndifferent national economies and states (albeit organized in oligopolistic manner under \nBritish or American hegemony) and as regulating changing forms of internationalization \n(albeit marked by continuing uneven development). Second generation work showed \nmore interest in the international constraints imposed on national regulation (Aglietta \n1994). More recently greater interest is also evident in whether a post-Bretton Woods \ninternational regime would need an associated super-state; in the impact of international \ninstability on national MoRs; and in the emergence of new forms of disequilibria in the \ninternational division of labour. \n \nParisian work has been largely conducted by economists, however, and this is reflected \nin a relative lack of interest in the state as such. Delorme has shown the most \nconsistent concern with this topic and done most to integrate it into the RA. His second-\ngeneration approach to the state as a relational, complex, integral entity7 is particularly \nconcerned with the mode of public presence in the economy (or MPPE). The latter is \nessentially a theoretically-informed matrix and identifies three ways and four main sites \nin and through which states may intervene in the economy (Delorme 1991, 1992, 1995). \nOther Parisian theorists have begun to show renewed interest in economic policy \n(Lordon 1995). The most distinctive regulationist account of the state has been \ndeveloped by Th\u00e9ret. This gives more weight to the relative autonomy of the state than \nis customary in the Parisian RA, explores the specificity of its economic order as a \n'fisco-financial' regime as well as its distinctive features as a political order, and \nexamines the dialectic between instituted economic and political orders and \neconomizing and political practices. Interestingly this third-generation approach is \ninspired by social topology and 'autopoiesis' (or self-organization) as well as Parisian \nRA (Th\u00e9ret 1990, 1992; for a more detailed summary, see Jessop 1997a). \n \nOutside Paris and Beyond \n \nMany studies undertaken outside Paris have largely followed the arguments of the first \ngeneration RA, ignoring subsequent developments, or, worse, have 'mistranslated' or \nvulgarized its claims. But there have also been some important innovations. These are \nless concerned with the economic dimensions of regulation, however, than with its \nsocial dimensions. Since it is impossible to deal with all of them, I will limit myself to just \nthree: a) space; b) government and governance; and c) discourse and identity. \n \nThere have been two important shifts in regulationist accounts of space: the first is a \nshift from concern with the regulation of pre-given spaces to the active production of \nspaces of regulation (Low 1995; Tickell and Peck 1993); and, second, linked to this, \nthere has been a shift from the taken-for-grantedness of the national level as the site of \nregulation to interest in the multi-scalar nature of regulation and, indeed, the \n'relativization of scale' in the after-Fordist period (cf. Moulaert 1994; Swyngedouw 1996, \n1997; Benko and Lipietz 1995; Collinge 1996). \n \nOn the first shift, Nick Low argues that the early RA tended to treat the geography of \nregulation as pre-inscribed within accumulation regimes and as altering \nunproblematically with the transition from one to another. He notes: \nThe geography of regulation was thus initially conceived as a \"space of regulation\", \na changing space economy impressed upon cities and regions by the mode of \nregulation originating at the global level [and] mediated by nation states. The \ninfluence of the global economy upon local developments can scarcely be disputed. \nBut what is not yet clear is how much local variation in regulatory structures is \npossible, and to what extent emergent problems such as socio-spatial polarization \nand misallocation of investment is due to particular local mediations and how much \nto the ineluctable force of global capitalism (Low 1995: 10). \nIt is now seen that scale\/space is not a necessary feature of accumulation regimes and \ntheir modes of regulation but a contingent effect of the loose, differential coupling \nbetween political institutions and the economics of capitalism (Low 1995: 9, 20). There \nhas also been interest in the discursive constitution of economic and political spaces \nand the struggles that occur over naming and mapping these spaces (Jenson 1995). \nThus some have asked how a relatively closed national economy was naturalized both \ndiscursively and institutionally as the principal object of economic regulation in Atlantic \nFordism (as compared to earlier pluri-national empires or the recent debate over 'global-\nlocal' relations). This issue can be concretized by studying how different 'imagined' \nnational economies co-evolved with different national Keynesian welfare states (Jessop \n1997b,c). Some have also questioned the capacity of flexible industrial districts to \nbecome the principal space of accumulation and regulation and, lacking a convincing \nanswer, pondered the problems of finding a suitable spatial fix for post-Fordism (Tickell \nand Peck 1993). \n \nOn the second shift, the Parisian RA still tends to prioritize the national level. Thus, if \nattention was directed elsewhere in early work, it was to consider complementarities \namong different national economies and\/or to enquire how international regimes helped \nstabilize the external conditions for national accumulation regimes.8 This prioritization of \nthe national economy and its national state may explain why the early RA showed little \nconcern with local, urban, and regional spaces of regulation or, except for the \ngrenoblois school, with supranational economic spaces. Indeed, Lipietz claimed that \nlocal and regional states lack the panoply of powers available to the nation-state as an \ninstance of regulation; and both he and Boyer have made the same argument about \nsupranational authorities (Lipietz 1994, 27-8; Boyer 1990: 39-40). \n \nThis relative neglect of other scales is one of six 'missing links' noted in in Tickell and \nPeck's critique of the RA (1993). The subsequent discovery of these sub-national levels \nof regulation was linked to the crisis of Atlantic Fordism, resurgence of the local and \nregional as sites of uneven development, growing interest in flexible industrial districts, \ninnovative milieux, etc., and a turn to supply-side policies implemented through local \npartnerships. The supra-national level has also been highlighted by the importance of \nthe European Union, other supranational blocs, and the debate over globalization. More \nrecent still has been an increasing interest in links among different scales of regulation \nand in the multi-scalar nature of modes of regulation which bear on any particular \neconomic space (cf. Moulaert 1994, 14; Swyngedouw 1996, 1997; Jessop 1997). \n \nLipietz is the first generation theorist who has done most work on space and uneven \ndevelopment (Lipietz 1978, 1980, 1988, 1994). His more recent work argues that space \nis a key aspect of economic regulation, suggesting it can appear both as a 'space in \nitself' and 'for itself'. In neither case, he emphasizes, need it coincide with national \nboundaries. A 'space in itself' consists in an 'economic region', i.e., 'an homogeneous \narea consisting of the articulation of modes and forms of production'. It is typically \norganized on different spatial scales (with internal differences, such as an urban-rural \ndivide and urban hierarchies) but also has its own 'definite subregime of accumulation' \nsuch that expanded reproduction of capitalism can occur within its borders. A 'space for \nitself' exists insofar as social forces in that space form an 'historic bloc' (class coalition) \nwhich both articulates the identity and interests of the economic region and can defend \nthese (in part through control of a state). Lipietz adds that Atlantic Fordism's golden age \nsaw a marked overlap between spaces of capital accumulation and spaces associated \nwith national states. Conversely, its crisis has prompted an extended inter-regional \ndivision of labour linking different national spaces as de-skilled assembly tasks are \nexported to peripheral Fordist economies (1994: 26-30). \n \nThe state was soon recognized as a weakpoint in the RA: indeed, Boyer listed further \nwork thereon among its second-generation tasks (1990). This may well be due to the \nParisian theorists' disappointment, if not disenchantment, with the Socialist Government \nbetween 1981 and 1983 and the need to re-think the nature of its relative autonomy and \nrole in institutionalized compromise (see above). Nonetheless, most of the innovative \nRA work on the state is due to non-Parisian theorists. \n \nTwo key contributors are the Marxist state theorists, Joachim Hirsch and Bob Jessop \neach of whom has sought to identify changes in the form of the state and its functions \nwhich would contribute to the regularization of an emergent post-Fordist accumulation \nregime. Among other differences, Hirsch's analyses are primarily grounded in the \nGerman case, Jessop's in a comparison between Britain and other Atlantic Fordist \neconomies; and Hirsch is more interested in the national state, Jessop in different \nscales of organization. This said, they agree that the Keynesian welfare state \nassociated with Atlantic Fordism is in crisis and that a new state form is emerging. Thus \nHirsch contrasts the Fordist Sicherheitsstaat (security state)9 and national \nWettbewerbsstaat (or 'competition state').10 As presented by Hirsch, the former is \nessentially a Keynesian welfare national state in German colours; the latter is marked \nby its subordination of domestic policy to Standortpolitik (policies designed to promote \nplace competitiveness) -- something common nowadays to most advanced capitalist \neconomies -- and the tendential rise of totalitarian civil society (more characteristic, \nperhaps, of Germany). Similarly, Jessop distinguishes a Keynesian welfare national \nstate (with three ideal-typical sub-species) which has a key role in regularizing Atlantic \nFordism and a Schumpeterian workfare regime (or SWR) (also with three ideal typical \nsub-species) which allegedly complements an emerging post-Fordism. Jessop adds \nthat, whereas the KWNS was primarily instituted at the national level, the SWR is \ncharacterized by the tendential de-nationalization of the state and a de-statization of \npolitics.11 \nMore generally, Jessop's work combines a 'strategic-relational approach' to the state \nwith a neo-Gramscian reading of the RA to generate a regulationist account of the \ninstitutional restructuring and strategic re-orientation of the state system in capitalism \n(cf. Jessop 1985, 1990, 1993, 1995). His work reveals major complementarities \nbetween the RA and (neo)-Gramscian state theory in their respective concerns with the \neconomy and the state in their inclusive senses; it establishes a general view of the \nstate as an object as well as subject of regulation; and it specifies political regimes that \ncorrespond overall in their economic and social roles to Atlantic Fordism and an \nemerging post-Fordism. \n \nRegulation theory is often accused of economism and structuralism and it is suggested \nthat there is little 'culture' in its description or explanation. This is only partly true of first \ngeneration theory with its interest in struggles over new production and consumption \nnorms and societal paradigms. The recent interest in 'conventions' suggests that the \nParisian RA has recognized its importance once again -- even if other Parisian \nregulationists criticize their approach in this regard. The accusation is even less true of \nsome recent work outside Paris. For there is now much interest in how MoRs help to \nconstitute and naturalize their objects in and through the very process of regulation. \nThis interest is evident in studies of Fordism in crisis and\/or post-Fordism -- especially in \nJenson's stimulating and original work (1989, 1990, 1993). There is also more emphasis \non specific forms of identity formation and subject formation as well as an extension of \nthe RA to include non-class movements and forces (cf. Steinmetz 1996) and the \noverdetermination of the wage relation and other aspects of regulation by gender, race, \nand ethnicity (e.g., Bakshi et al., 1995). \n \n[Jenson advocates analyses of historically developed sets of practices and meanings \nwhich provide the actual regulatory mechanisms for a specific mode of growth and \nbroader 'societal paradigms'. This implies that economic crises involve more than a final \nencounter with pregiven structural limits. They are actually manifested and resolved in \nan interdiscursive field in which social forces assert their identities and interests. Newly \nvisible and active forces emerge in a crisis and participate in the expanding universe of \npolitical discourse; they offer over alternative MoRs and societal paradigms and struggle \nto institutionalize a new compromise. If a new 'model of development' does becomes \nhegemonic, it establishes new rules for recognizing actors and defining interests \n(Jenson 1990: 666). Such comments highlight the discursive constitution of objects of \nregulation by showing how new paradigms may be constructed through the entry of new \nsocial subjects. \n \nIV - Critique and Counter-Critique \n \nIn their foreword to a compendium of RA work, Boyer and Saillard noted that 'many \nadvances have passed unnoticed in so far as some appreciations of regulation theory \nstill bear on old and superceded founding works' (1995a: 15, my translation). This \nadmonition must be taken seriously. Indeed, given the vast range of recent work \nemanating from this school and its disciples, references in many critiques are often \nwoefully limited to a couple of pioneer texts and some standard (and frequently out-\ndated) secondary works. This observation does mean the RA is beyond criticism. It \ndoes suggest the need for more balanced and up-to-date commentaries. This can be \nshown by re-examining some standard criticisms. \n \nThe RA has been criticized on several counts. Firstly, it is accused of functionalism, i.e., \nof assuming that MoRs emerge in order to meet certain functional needs of pre-given \nARs. Even if true of cavalier theoretical appropriations and\/or political vulgarizations of \nthe RA, it never really held for the pioneer texts. These stressed the discontinuities in \nARs and the problematic emergence of new MoRs through search processes and class \nstruggles. Further theoretical work on this issue has produced a well-rehearsed \nresponse. MoRs are actually 'chance discoveries' which co-evolve with, and thereby co-\ndetermine, ARs. This excludes both teleological accounts suggesting that MoRs arise in \norder to consolidate an existing AR; and those ex post functionalist accounts arguing \nthat an existing AR will be consolidated only if an appropriate MoR can be discovered \nand instituted. A third-generation anti-functionalist response is that ARs are co-\nproduced through attempts at regulation. They do not pre-exist MoRs. Instead the \nspaces and scales on which they operate, their temporal rhythms, their crisis-\ntendencies, and so on, in short, their basic features and structural forms, are the \nproduct of attempts to envision, institute, and consolidate a more or less coherent and \nmanageable set of economic relations and their extra-economic conditions of existence \n(cf. Jessop 1995b, 1997b; Lipietz 1987). \n \nSecondly, some critics claim the RA is structuralist. It allegedly attributes iron laws of \nmotion to capitalism and prioritizes structures over agency. It supposedly believes in \nobjective and immutable laws of capitalism operating 'behind the backs of the \nproducers'; and so it either ignores class struggle or treats it as a ruse of capitalism's \nself-development. From the outset, however, almost all regulationists regarded \neconomic laws as mediated in and through specific institutions and practices and \nargued that no MoR contains class struggles for ever. Remember, too, that the RA \noriginated in attempts to explain the genesis and crisis of Fordism in the USA and \nFrance; and that its pioneers emphasized the historical variability of capitalist crisis-\ntendencies. Subsequent theoretical work has also shown that the so-called 'laws' of \ncapitalism are, in fact, 'doubly tendential'. Not only do they operate as tendencies (with \ncounter-tendencies) which are realized only in specific conditions; they are themselves \ntendential, i.e., they operate as tendencies only insofar as the social relations in which \nthey are inscribed as emergent properties12 are 'reproduced-regularized' through a \ncomplex web of social practices (cf. Jessop 1990a; Lipietz 1993, 1997). This response \nis, of course, wholly consistent with that to charges of functionalism. \n \nThe other side of this two-edged criticism is also wrong. Not only can the the 'laws' of \ncapitalism be grounded in an extended regulation of social relations of production, there \nhas also been growing interest in the micro-foundations of this regulation and in the best \nway to describe and explain social agency. Although Aglietta has since indicated that \nhis initial work was inspired by Bourdieu's sociology and Foucault's micro-physics of \npower (see Dosse 1992b: 338), more recent Parisian RA work has moved away from \nsuch sociological concerns. A lively debate has ensued among some French \nregulationists about the suitability of 'methodological individualist' micro-foundations \ndrawn from rational choice, game-theoretic, transactions costs, and conventionalist \napproaches (see Jessop 1997a). There have also been suggestions about how to link \nregulation to social, rather than methodologically individualist, accounts of agency. The \nlatter range from a Giddensian structurationist approach, which merely emphasizes the \n'duality of structure and agency' (e.g., Esser et al., 1994) and the analogous \nappropriation of Bourdieu's concept of 'habitus' (cf. Painter 1997) through the strategic-\nrelational approach (cf. Jessop 1990) to concerns with the 'assujettissement'13 of agents \nas imperfect bearers of incomplete capitalist relations of production (Scherrer 1995) and \nanalysis of identity struggles in and during crises of accumulation (Jenson 1990, 1991). \nIn one case, this concern with social agency even extends to the embodiment of \nregulation in the transformation of bodies (Wark 1994). \n \nThirdly, some argue that regulationism is too simplistic, reducing postwar history to an \ninevitable transition from a stable Fordism to a stable post-Fordism. This criticism would \nbe better aimed at its superficial reception. It also ignores the RA's emphasis on \nhistorical specificity and the widening empirical scope of recent regulationist work. Thus \nsecond- and third-generation studies have demonstrated the wide range of ARs that co-\nexisted in Atlantic Fordism's orbit as well as the obstacles encountered and overcome in \nstabilizing these regimes in all their rich variety during 'les trente glorieuses'. There are \nalso many studies of peripheral Fordisms and other types of AR outside the main circuit \nof Atlantic Fordism and a growing appreciation of the other scales on which local and\/or \nregional ARs were organized. Moreover, as indicated above, there is now considerable \ninterest in alternative trajectories beyond Fordism and in the many complex problems of \nachieving them. Indeed, it is one of the more salutary lessons learnt by the RA over the \nlast twenty years (which have coincided, of course, with the Fordist crisis and its still \nunresolved aftermath) that there are no easy roads to re-regularizing capitalism. \nCertainly no-one any longer suggests, as Boyer once did in his critical presentation of \nthe RA and proposals for a second-generation of research, that it would be possible to \nundertake 'real time' observation of crisis-resolution (Boyer 1970b: 111)! \n \nFourthly, the very idea of 'regulation' is said to imply that conscious action (most \nnotably, state intervention) can somehow suspend capital's contradictions and guide \naccumulation without crises. This charge is rooted in anglophone confusion between \nr\u00e9gulation (social regularization) and legal or state regulation (which would be termed \nr\u00e9glementation in French). But it may have acquired some credence because of the \ntechnocratic basis of the first generation RA and their initial interest in the state's \nprimary role in codifying the institutionalized compromise necessary to any \naccumulation 'en regime'. This heightens the paradox that most RA scholars have \nactually shown little interest in the details of economic policy or any forms of state \nintervention. This can be linked to the RA's initial theoretical concern with the origins of \ncrisis rather than any possible policy-induced or state-engineered escape therefrom \n(Lordon 1995). But more recent work has begun remedying this neglect through \ntheoretical and empirical research on the mode of public presence in the economy, on \neconomic policy, and on issues of economic governance, i.e., the various forms of \nstrategic coordination of interdependent economic activities. In this light, MoRs define \nthe parameters within which governance operates. Structural forms should not be \nunderstood as mechanisms that ensure a simple repetition of routine behaviours but, \nrather, as relatively coherent frameworks providing a repertoire of responses which may \nsecure some partial, localized, and temporary control in a turbulent, crisis-prone \nenvironment. As Boyer and Saillard note, the concept of 'mode of development does not \nimply identical reproduction but, on the contrary, inscription into the time of history: \nsurviving unforeseen events, moving through cycles, progressively altering institutional \nforms, [and even] opening up the possibility of evolutions so contradictory they become \nexplosive' (Boyer and Saillard 1995a: 64; cf., on the ebb and flow of diverse regulatory \npractices, Painter and Goodwin 1995). And, if there is no quasi-automatic reproduction, \nactions make a difference. In periods en r\u00e9gulation, regulation and governance occur \nwithin parameters defined by institutionalized structural forms, during periods of \nstructural crisis they are more experimental, trial-and-error, and chaotic. This search \nprocess is a source of institutional and behavioural variation; more successful \nexperiments are selected in an ex post manner; and, through their co-evolution, are re-\ninstitutionalized and retained as the basis for a new repertoire of governance \nmechanisms. This concern with agency should not be confused, however, with an \nexplicit, state-centred, top-down account of regulation. Instead it emphasizes the \nnecessity and fragility of attempts to regularize and govern a complex economic and \nextra-economic process. \n \nFinally, it is alleged that, because regulation theorists have speculated about new forms \nof compromise which might help to stabilize a post-Fordist capitalism, they are mere \npolitical reformists. There is no obvious single political message entailed in the RA, \nhowever; regulationist positions range from social democracy to political ecology, from \nradical reformism to self-management, from the defense of Keynesian welfarism to \n'progressive competitiveness', from economic nationalism to advocacy of a social \nEurope. Indeed, as the RA has been incrementally extended, progressively deepened, \nand radically reconstructed, it has become far less determinate in its political \nimplications. It would, in any case, be wrong to sacrifice the RA's major heuristic \npotential of secondary disagreements over political issues. \nV - Concluding Remarks \n \nThere is a paradox in the influence achieved by the RA. It has been very influential \ntheoretically in many social science disciplines and it is has also had a major impact on \nresearch agendas in many different fields of study. Yet it has failed to realize key \nelements of its original scientific and political agenda. It aimed to transform the field of \neconomics by a direct assault on the basic assumptions of the 'standard' model and to \nre-orient it in an evolutionary, institutional, and sociological direction. The Parisian \nschool could also be interpreted, on the basis of its critique of structural marxism, as \nwishing to transform the sociological understanding of capitalism by integrating the \neconomic and extra-economic moments. In both respects its expectations have been \ndisappointed. It finds itself isolated in relation to mainstream economics and it has not \nconvinced the other social sciences to take serious account of structural economic \nforms and mechanisms. Nor did it gain significant influence over state policy in France \neven when the political conjuncture seemed favourable. \n \nThe Parisian school has reacted to its isolation in mainstream economics in three ways. \nFirst, it has borrowed from other social sciences to lend it legitimacy. The mainstream, \nhowever, remains unconvinced. Second, it has tried to find micro-economic foundations \nfor the RA which would substitute those of homo economicus. Of particular significance \nhere are transaction costs analysis and the sociology of conventions. And, third, it has \nsought a rapprochement with other forms of institutional and evolutionary economics. \nBut the RA has not broken through the defense mechanisms of the hermetically closed \n'standard' theory. The latter has recuperated these and many other attacks (as \nanticipated, for the RA, by Cartelier and de Vroey 1990). It still prefers to explain the \neconomy in narrow economic terms even as it pursues 'economic imperialism' in other \ndisciplines through the extension of its assumptions and economic modelling to other \nareas. The RA has failed to win the battle in economics -- which largely remains \nresolutely committed to explaining the economic within a narrow, anti-institutionalist \nframework and has also contrived to export this framework into other social sciences. \nThus Boyer was led to comment, in self-evident frustration, on the paradox that, \n'whereas neo-classical methodology enjoys an hegemony [in economics] that is \nsupposed to produce a cumulative research programme, its results are actually more \ncontradictory than ever. In contrast, regulation theory is multiplying its methodological \ntools -- thereby giving the impression of fragmentation -- but is simultaneously delivering \na series of clearly convergent conclusions which are refined compared to the \nbeginnings in the 1970s' (Boyer 1995b: 23, my translation). \n \nAt the same time, the Parisian RA has failed in its objectives even where it has seemed \nmost successful. For its message to other social sciences has been mis-read, rejected, \nor blurred. Its proselytization attempts have typically been one-sidedly appropriated by \nother social sciences. Recall here that the RA tried to correct the one-sidedness of \nmainstream economics by stressing the need to complement the study of economic \nmechanisms of reproduction with that of extra-economic mechanisms of r\u00e9gulation. \nWhereas mainstream economics has largely ignored the role of r\u00e9gulation, however, \nother social sciences have largely ignored the role of market-mediated reproduction. \nThe early RA was much interested in the specificities of 'stagflation' (stagnation and \ninflation) and the nature of money; although this particular symptom of the Atlantic \nFordist crisis is not significant in after-Fordism, this does not justify neglect of economic \nforms and their role by other social sciences.14 Yet, for most social scientists, the RA is \nequated with analysis of social embeddedness, with the social dimensions of MoRs, and \nwith the extra-economic dimensions of capitalism. By and large they neglect the \nspecifically economic aspects of such structural forms as the commodity, the wage-\nrelation, money, credit, taxation, the price mechanism, changing forms of competition, \netc. -- the realm of 'hard' political economy rather than 'soft' economic sociology. \n \nThere are two further areas where the RA can be said to have failed in its \nproselytization attempts outside mainstream economics. The micro-foundations it \nproposed as alternatives to the neo-classical paradigm have been rejected by social \nscientists in favour of other accounts. This is seen in attempts to ground 'r\u00e9gulation' in \nstructuration theory, in discourse analysis, in the strategic-relational approach, etc.. This \nis hardly surprising as recently proposed Parisian micro-foundations have de-radicalized \nthe original marxist-inspired analysis in favour of forms of methodological individualism \nand encouraged a retreat towards game-theoretic or transaction costs analyses. And, \nfinally, as other forms of institutional and evolutionary economics have been developed, \nit has become less clear what is distinctive about the RA. Its message has been \ndissipated within a more general appreciation of the importance of institutional and \nevolutionary approaches to economic analysis. Nor has the RA's attempted \nrapprochement with other approaches helped here. \n \nThese remarks might well suggest that the RA has been a double failure. For one might \nwell conclude that it has failed to convince mainstream economists that economics \nshould cease to regard extra-economic phenomena as irrelevant or marginal, ceteris \nparibus issues; and it has failed to convince mainstream social scientists that \naccumulation cannot be explained without reference to economic as well as extra-\neconomic mechanisms. But this does not justify the conclusion that twenty years of the \nRA has not really been worth it. Academic debates are themselves socially embedded \nand it would be quite unreasonable to expect the RA to dislodge the standard theory \nwhen there are many vested interests in the latter's survival. Moreover, despite this \ndouble disappointment in terms of two key parts of its original project, there have been \nmany successes. However one-sided the reception of its own dialectical message \nbeyond the original Parisian school, the latter has certainly proved capable of continuing \nto develop the original approach in regard to economic and extra-economic \nmechanisms alike. It has had an enormous catalytic impact in reorienting social and \neconomic analysis in the social sciences -- even if this has occurred in ways not \noriginally intended. It has made major contributions to the overall analysis of \naccumulation as a socially embedded, socially regulated process. Its disciples have \nplaced the contingent periodization of capitalism on the agenda; highlighted the crisis of \nAtlantic Fordism and the search for post-Fordist trajectories; explained different crisis \nforms (stagflation, etc.); shed new light on the economic role of the state; studied \nchanging forms of international15ization; studied the nestedness of different \naccumulation regimes and modes of regulation; revealed the importance of the \nproduction of space and scale; applied the RA productively to post-socialism and East \nAsian NICs; generated work on Japan, the labour process, etc.. By most reasonable \nstandards, this is no mean achievement. Even more important, the RA remains a \nprogressive research paradigm with many themes still to be explored. \n \n \n \n                                                          \nEndnotes \n1 I have benefitted from discussions with so many regulationists it would be invidious to name just a few. Earlier \nversions were presented at Manchester University and the Wessex Geographers' Research Workshop. The research \nwas partly funded by an ESRC Local Governance Programme grant (L 31125302). The usual disclaimers apply. \n2 On the grounds that all individuals have perfect knowledge about the future and no individual's actions can affect \nthe overall development of the market. \n3 Because the market mechanism permits a return to previous positions. \n4 And, against the Keynesian alternative, that they matter in more than an instrumental manner (Dosse 1992: 336). \n5 Both aspects are discussed under the rubric of 'approfondissement' (deepening) in Boyer and Saillard (1995). \n6 The phrase comes from Vercellone (1994). \n7 He introduced the acronym '\u00c9RIC' (l'\u00c9tat relationel int\u00e9gral complexe) to describe this approach. \n8 Aglietta, for example, noted how the low-inflation, export-oriented German economy was structurally coupled to \nthe high-inflation French economy which imported German goods and compensated for inflation by periodic \ndevaluations (1982). Likewise, Mistral suggested 'the stability of an international regime rests on the conformity of \nthe map of the international division of labour with the forms of regulation' (1986: 188). \n9 Sicherheit refers here both to social security and the welfare state and to the state's disciplinary surveillance of \nsociety to protect national security (Hirsch 1984; 1995). \n10 The concept of 'competition state' derives from Cerny (1992). \n11 A third trend is the internationalization of policy regimes. \n12 Or, in critical realist terms, inscribed as 'natural necessities'. \n13 'Assujettissement' refers to the complex process of forming subjects. \n14 For a contrasting example, from a non-regulationist economist, see Gough's value-theoretical work, which covers \nseveral RA major themes with power and insight (1992a, 1992b, 1996a, 1996b). \n \nReferences \n \nAglietta, Michel (1974) Accumulation et r\u00e9gulation du capitalisme en longue periode. \nExemple des \u00c9tats-Unis (1870-1970), Paris: Institut National de la Statistique et \ndes \u00c9tudes \u00c9conomiques. \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAglietta, Michel (1979) A Theory of Capitalist Regulation: the U.S. Experience, London: \nVerso (first published in French 1976). \nAglietta, Michel (1986) La fin de devises cl\u00e9s, Paris: La D\u00e9couverte. \nAglietta, Michel (1994) 'De \"R\u00e9gulation et crises du capitalisme\" \u00e0 la \"Violence de la \nmonnaie\" et au-del\u00e0.
