Introdu\rtion\nIn \rombination, altimetry and a satellite gravity mission su\rh as GRACE have the18\npotential to distinguish between barotropi\r and baro\rlini\r sea-level \rhanges and thereby19\nshed new light on the physi\rs of the o\rean. Jayne et al. [2003\u2104 for instan\re shows how20\nthe two \rould be \rombined to determine \rhanges in o\rean heat storage. Regarding o\rean21\nbottom pressure derived from GRACE observations, however, we are still at the validation22\nstage where (with some \rir\rularity) we wish to use altimetry to make inferen\res regarding23\nthe expe\rted GRACE signal. To this end, in a re\rent paper Vinogradova et al. [2007\u210424\n(hen\reforth VPS) investigated the relationship between sea-level and bottom pressure25\nvariability in the \roarse (1\n\u00c6\n) resolution o\rean model ECCO. They found strong equivalen\re26\nbetween model sea-level and bottom pressure at periods <30 days, while at periods up27\nto 100 days the the strong equivalen\re was generally \ron\fned to shallow seas and at high28\nlatitudes (>60\n\u00c6\n). At longer periods little \rorresponden\re was found between sea-level and29\nbottom pressure.30\nHowever, on smaller s\rales the o\rean and sea-level, parti\rularly in regions of strong31\n\rurrents, are dominated by mesos\rale eddies, and this is in fa\rt where the majority of the32\no\rean's kineti\r energy lies [Fu and Smith, 1996\u2104. For this reason \roarse resolution models33\ntend to underestimate, quite drasti\rally in some \rases, the sea-level varian\re in \romparison34\nwith what is measured by altimetry. Therefore, sin\re these eddies are generally baro\rlini\r,35\nthe strong \rorresponden\re in sea-level and bottom pressure reported by VPS may well be36\nan artifa\rt of the \roarse, non-eddy permitting resolution of their model (a point raised37\nby VPS themselves). In this paper, therefore, we extend the VPS analysis to an eddy38\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nX - 4 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION\nresolving o\rean model, also with realisti\r for\ring, attempting to repli\rate the analysis of39\nVPS as \rlosely as possible.40\n2. Model des\rription\nThe main results of this paper are based on an analysis of the O\rean Cir\rulation and41\nClimate Advan\red Modelling proje\rt model (OCCAM) run at the National O\reanography42\nCentre, Southampton. It is a global, z-level, free surfa\re model with a rotated grid over43\nthe North Atlanti\r, and is for\red with 6-hourly ECMWF atmospheri\r data. The run we44\nare \ronsidering (run 202) is at 0.25\n\u00c6\nresolution, with 66 verti\ral levels, and \rovers the 19-45\nyear period 1985-2003, with an initial 4 years of spin-up [Coward and de Cuevas, 2005\u2104.46\nThe data is output as \fve day means. We apply an inverse barometer \rorre\rtion to the47\nmodel sea-level, as the for\ring (unlike in VPS) in\rludes atmospheri\r pressure.48\n3. Results\nCompared with the \roarse resolution ECCO model used by VPS, at the eddy permit-49\nting resolution of OCCAM the regions of high sea-level variability are more \rlearly asso-50\n\riated with regions of strong \rurrents, parti\rularly noti\reable along the Gulf-Stream and51\nNorth Atlanti\r Current (NAC), the Antar\rti\r Cir\rumpolar Current (ACC) and the Ag-52\nulhas retro-re\re\rtion (Figure 1a). Moreover, the amplitude is several \rentimetres greater,53\na\rhieving values in ex\ress of 15\rm. This is in spite of the fa\rt that we are using \fve day54\nmeans, for whi\rh some high frequen\ry power is lost, rather than the daily mean values55\nused by VPS. This \ron\frms the view that mesos\rale eddy variability, generated in regions56\nof baro\rlini\r instability, makes a signi\f\rant \rontribution to the sea-level anomaly \feld.57\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nBINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION X - 5\nThe ability of a model to permit eddies has a mu\rh smaller in\ruen\re on bottom pressure58\nthan is the \rase for sea-level, both in terms of overall stru\rture and amplitude (Figure 1b).59\nThis supports the idea that the regions of high variability seen in the OCCAM sea-level60\nmap are due primarily to baro\rlini\r eddies. Within the large regions of \roherent bot-61\ntom pressure \ru\rtuations in the Southern O\rean and the North Pa\ri\f\r, bottom pressure62\ndeviations are up to 1-2\rm less in OCCAM \rompared with the VPS model, but have a63\nsimilar form, being, as they are, de\fned by topographi\r \rontours [Webb and de Cuevas,64\n2002a, b; Bingham and Hughes, 2006\u2104. Sin\re bottom pressure \ru\rtuations generally have65\nsigni\f\rant power at periods less than \fve days this is most likely due to the fa\rt that the66\nOCCAM data have been averaged over a longer time span. Although in terms of sea-level67\nthe Ar\rti\r does not stand out as a region of espe\rially high variability, in terms of bottom68\npressure it does. A similar signal in a barotropi\r version of OCCAM and observational69\neviden\re for it was presented by Hughes and Stepanov [2004\u2104. The boundary of this signal70\nis sharply de\fned by the topography of the Greenland-S\rotland Ridge between the North71\nAtlanti\r and Nordi\r Seas and the shelf in the Bering Strait, and most likely represents a72\ntrapped geostrophi\r mode similar to those found in the Southern O\rean. As in the VPS73\nmodel, the greatest bottom pressure amplitudes are found in shallow shelf seas.74\nFollowing VPS we quantify the extent to whi\rh sea-level anomalies are barotropi\r by\n\romputing the \rorresponden\re between sea-level h\n0\nand bottom pressure p\n0\nb\nanomalies (the\nlatter expressed in sea-level units by multiplying by a referen\re density and a\r\releration\ndue to gravity), de\fned as:\ns =\n< h\n0\n\u0000 p\n0\nb\n>\n< h\n0\n>\n; (1)\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nX - 6 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION\nwhere angle bra\rkets represents varian\re of the term en\rlosed by them. Clearly a s\rore of75\ns = 0 would indi\rate that sea-level variability is entirely barotropi\r. The map of s is shown76\nin Figure 1\r. The predominan\re of yellow to red \rolours shows that over most of the open77\no\rean baro\rlini\r variability dominates. Only in the Ar\rti\r basin, the shallow shelf seas,78\nand some isolated pat\rhes of the Southern O\rean does barotropi\r variability dominate79\nwhen all times\rales are \ronsidered. The pattern is similar to that found in the ECCO80\nmodel used by VPS. This is be\rause the presen\re of eddies only weakens the relationship81\nbetween sea-level and bottom pressure in regions where most of the large-s\rale sea-level82\nvarian\re is, in any \rase, weakly \roupled to bottom pressure.83\nNext we \ronsider how the relationship between sea-level and bottom pressure depends\non latitude and on the water depth as a fun\rtion of frequen\ry. Cross-spe\rtral analysis\nprovides an appropriate means to do this. The mean admittan\re between sea-level and\nbottom pressure anomalies over a parti\rular geographi\r interval (as shown in Figure 2) is\nde\fned by\nZ(!) =\n^\nh\n0 ^\np\n0\nb\n\u0003\n^\nh\n0\n^\nh\n0\n\u0003\n; (2)\nwhere x^ represents the Fourier transform of x, and x represents the mean of x. Motivated84\nby Figure 1\r whi\rh shows \rlearly the mu\rh \rloser relationship between sea-level and85\nbottom pressure over the shelf-seas \rompared with the deep o\rean we \rompute the mean86\nadmittan\re for shallow (<200m) and deep (>1000m) parts of the o\rean separately (see87\nFigure 2a). At the Nyquist frequen\ry (0.1 \rpd) the amplitude of the admittan\re is 188\nindi\rating the variability on the shelf is essentially barotropi\r. As we move to lower89\nfrequen\ries the amplitude de\rlines, but always remains greater than 0.8, showing that90\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nBINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION X - 7\neven on multi-year times\rales baro\rlini\r pro\resses do not strongly de\rouple sea-level from91\nbottom pressure in shallow water. The similarity to the result from ECCO presented by92\nVPS is to be expe\rted as eddies are not the dominant sour\re of sea-level variability on93\nthe shelves.94\nA mu\rh greater di\u000beren\re between ECCO and OCCAM is seen we we \ronsider the95\nadmittan\re between sea-level and bottom pressure over the deep o\rean. We now see96\n\rlearly the in\ruen\re of eddies. Like the variability on the shelf, at the highest resolvable97\nfrequen\ries the deep o\rean in OCCAM is primarily barotropi\r, as it is in ECCO. And98\nin both models, the admittan\re amplitude falls away mu\rh more rapidly than is the \rase99\nin shallow water, indi\rating the importan\re of baro\rlini\r pro\resses in the deep o\rean.100\nHowever, the roll-o\u000b is mu\rh steeper in OCCAM. In OCCAM the amplitude falls to101\nbelow 0.2 for periods greater than 100 days, while for ECCO the amplitude is 0.5 at 100102\ndays, and even for mu\rh longer periods it remains above 0.4. This implies that in OCCAM103\nthe baro\rlini\r nature of sea-level variability over the deep o\rean \romes to prominen\re at104\nrelatively high frequen\ries \rompared with ECCO. This is \ronsistent with the expe\rted105\ne\u000be\rt of mesos\rale eddies, whi\rh are absent from ECCO and whi\rh lo\rally weaken the106\nrelationship between sea-level and bottom pressure.107\nIn Figure 2a we also address the question of whether the presen\re of eddies disrupts the108\nrelationship between sea-level and bottom pressure over the deep o\rean at larger s\rales.109\nForming 1\n\u00c6\nor 2\n\u00c6\nbox averages does little to \rhange the spe\rtral relationship between the110\ntwo \felds. This shows that mesos\rale eddies \rontribute to the sea-level variability at111\nlength-s\rales greater than the resolution that is required for them to be present in the112\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nX - 8 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION\nmodel, and we \rannot re\rover a relationship between sea-level and bottom pressure similar113\nto that found in ECCO simply by averaging the high resolution \feld to the resolution of114\nECCO. In fa\rt it is not until we average over 8\n\u00c6\nbins that a relationship similar to that115\nreported by VPS is seen.116\nFigure 1\r shows that, when \ronsidered over all frequen\ries taken together, the variability117\nin the deep o\rean at high latitudes tends to be more barotropi\r than at lower latitudes. We118\ntherefore now \ronsider how the relationship in the tropi\rs (0\n\u00c6\nto 15\n\u00c6\n), the mid-latitudes119\n(45\n\u00c6\nto 60\n\u00c6\n), and high latitudes (60\n\u00c6\nto 80\n\u00c6\n) depends on frequen\ry (see Figure 2b). It120\nis \rlear from Figure 2b that the variability in any parti\rular frequen\ry band be\romes121\nmore barotropi\r as we move progressively poleward, just as was the \rase for the ECCO122\nmodel used by VPS. Whilst at the Nyquist frequen\ry the variability in both mid- and123\nhigh-latitudes bands is essentially barotropi\r, in the tropi\rs sea-level variability, even at124\nthe highest resolvable frequen\ries, in\rludes signi\f\rant baro\rlini\r variability. Just as for125\nthe deep o\rean taken it is entirety, the individual latitude bands ea\rh show a more rapid126\nde\rline in barotropi\r variability relative to baro\rlini\r variability, \rompared with the ECCO127\nmodel. However, the de\rline in the barotropi\r to baro\rlini\r ratio o\r\rurs more slowly at128\nhigher latitudes. In general, at all latitudes the o\rean is less barotropi\r in OCCAM than129\nit is in ECCO.130\nTo test the hypothesis that the more rapid de\rline in barotropi\r variability in OCCAM131\n\rompared with ECCO is due to eddies we re\rompute the \rross-spe\rtra for the mid- and132\nhigh-latitude bands but with further partitioning between regions of low (sd<5\rm) and133\nhigh (sd>10\rm) sea-level variability. As Figure 3\r shows, over regions of low sea-level134\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nBINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION X - 9\nvariability, indi\rative of regions of little eddy a\rtivity, our \rross-spe\rtra look mu\rh more135\nlike those found in ECCO. The variability remains barotropi\r to longer times\rales, than136\nwas the \rase for the zonal bands \ronsidered in their entirety, parti\rularly for the mid-137\nlatitude band. The roll-o\u000b is also more gradual, although the \fnal amplitudes are still138\nsomewhat less than for the ECCO model. On the other hand, the \rross-spe\rtra for139\nthe regions of high sea-level variability, indi\rative of greater eddy a\rtivity, appear as more140\nextreme versions of the \rorresponding spe\rtra of Figure 2b. Even at the Nyquist frequen\ry141\nthe variability is signi\f\rantly di\u000berent from barotropi\r and the redu\rtion in the barotropi\r142\nto baro\rlini\r energy ratio is mu\rh more rapid than in the low variability regions. The main143\ndi\u000beren\re between mid and high latitudes is that there is a larger fra\rtion of the domain144\nin the mid-latitude band o\r\rupied by eddies.145\nFinally, we \ronsider the geographi\ral patterns of admittan\re partitioned by frequen\ry\nband (as shown in Figure 3). This is de\fned by summing over the required band be-\nfore \ral\rulating the \romplex produ\rt (rather than \romputing the average of the \romplex\nprodu\rts as in equation 2):\nZ(!) =\n^\nh\n0\n^\np\n0\nb\n\u0003\n^\nh\n0\n^\nh\n0\n\u0003\n: (3)\nUsing the ECCO model, VPS found that in the 1{20 \rpd frequen\ry band the o\rean146\nbehaved everywhere outside the tropi\rs as a barotropi\r \ruid. In OCCAM too, we \fnd that147\nover most of the extra-tropi\ral o\rean in the 10{20 \rpd frequen\ry band the o\rean behaves148\nbarotropi\rally (see Figure 3a). However, unlike ECCO, even at these high frequen\ries the149\n\rlose \rorresponden\re between sea-level and bottom pressure breaks down in the regions150\nwhere there are strong \rurrents, su\rh as the Gulf-Stream, Kuroshio, Agulhas, and the151\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nX - 10 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION\nACC. These are regions where the sea-level variability is greatest. Moving to the 20-152\n60\rpd band (see Figure 3b) the pi\rture is again in broad terms as it is with ECCO. The153\ntropi\ral region of de\roheren\re in the deep o\rean has now spread to higher latitudes by154\nseveral degrees and the small regions of de\roheren\re asso\riated with the strong \rurrents,155\nseen at the highest frequen\ries, have grown and spread along the extensions in the \rase156\nof the Kuroshio and Gulf-Stream. This growth of de\roheren\re is mu\rh less pronoun\red157\nin the ECCO model, a result of not representing baro\rlini\r eddies that are produ\red in158\nthese regions. Note also how, in addition to the energeti\r western boundary regions, there159\nare thin regions of de\roheren\re at other o\rean boundaries. This may be a result of the160\npropagation of waves with baro\rlini\r stru\rture along the shelf slope, or it may re\re\rt the161\nfa\rt that intera\rtions with this steep topography introdu\res shorter length s\rales, whi\rh162\nresults in a shorter time being ne\ressary for baro\rlini\r e\u000be\rts to be\rome important (see163\nthe s\raling given by Gill and Niiler [1973\u2104). At seasonal times\rales, over the open o\rean,164\nit is only some small isolated pat\rhes of the Southern O\rean and in the Ar\rti\r that remain165\n\roherent in OCCAM. Similarly in ECCO it is the Southern O\rean and Ar\rti\r O\rean where166\nthe signal remain \roherent, although for the Southern O\rean the \roheren\re is somewhat167\nstronger than it is in OCCAM. ECCO also shows greater \roheren\re in the South Pa\ri\f\r168\nin \romparison to OCCAM.169\nIn Figure 3d we extend the analysis to interannual time periods where we \fnd that over170\nthe open o\rean variability is dominated by baro\rlini\r pro\resses.

So, in re-182\ngions where short length s\rale eddies are most energeti\r, the de\roupling o\r\rurs even at183\nperiods as short as 10{20 days, spreading at longer times\rales to broader regions with184\nsubstantial mesos\rale variability. Similarly, bottom pressure and sea-level variability be-185\n\rome de\roupled relatively qui\rkly over the steep \rontinental slopes, where length s\rales186\nare naturally short. Regions in whi\rh bottom pressure and sea-level remain \roupled to187\nrelatively long periods, su\rh as the Ar\rti\r and some regions of the Southern O\rean, \ror-188\nrespond to regions of parti\rularly energeti\r barotropi\r \ru\rtuations and parti\rularly weak189\nmesos\rale variability. Even here, however, little \roheren\re remains at interannual peri-190\nods. At su\rh periods, \roheren\re only remains in shelf sea regions, where the barotropi\r191\n\ru\rtuations are espe\rially large, and where the shallow depth means that larger density192\nvariations are needed to \rompensate the sea-level variations. Another spe\rial \rase is the193\ntropi\ral band where, as a result of the more rapid propagation of waves at low latitudes,194\nD R A F T November 13, 2007, 8:08pm D R A F T\nX - 12 BINGHAM AND HUGHES: SEA-LEVEL\/BOTTOM PRESSURE RELATION\nbaro\rlini\r variability be\romes important at shorter times\rales although, again, this o\r\rurs195\nat shorter times\rales for \ru\rtuations at short length s\rales than for those at longer length196\ns\rales. Our study provides no reason to believe that the presen\re of eddies disrupts the197\nrelationship between sea-level and bottom pressure, other than in the obvious way that198\nsea-level and bottom pressure are only weakly \roupled in the eddies themselves.199\nFor \romparison of sea-level from altimetry with bottom pressure from GRACE, we \fnd200\nthat it is ne\ressary to average over about 8\n\u00c6\nin order to retain a strong \rorrelation out201\nto a period of 100 days. That is with perfe\rt sea-level data; with the sampling permitted202\nby altimetry it is not \rlear whether even su\rh large-s\rale averaging would be su\u00c6\rient203\nto \flter out the mesos\rale signal. An alternative, as we show in Fig. 2\r, is to \rompare204\nsea-level and bottom pressure in regions with relatively small sea-level varian\re.205\nA\rknowledgments.
