Marra** * Pennsylvania State University and **AT&T, USA Introduction We seek to provide an alternative theoretical perspective on concept mapping (a formalism for representing structural knowledge) to that provided by Ray McAleese in this issue of ALT-J (auto-monitoring).

We proceed by defining Mindtools as formalisms for representing knowledge, and further elaborate on concept maps as a formalism for representing a particular kind of knowledge: structural knowledge.

Finally, we describe some limitations of concept mapping as a formalism and as a cognitive learning strategy. Concept maps, both in how they are used and theoretically based, touch some of the central elements of instructional technology and learning.

It was, I felt, a technique - one of several - that helped learners to articulate\ntheir burgeoning understanding of some topic, providing a canvas on which to record, expand\nand manipulate their knowledge. The activities involved in concept mapping could be linked\nto well-known psychological principles of understanding, memorization and learning: effort,\nelaboration and depth of processing; generation and enactment effects; encoding specificity\nand encoding variability; the distinctions between explicit and implicit representations; meta-\ncognitive strategies and reflection, and so forth (Hammond 1993). These psychological\nunderpinnings, while not in any sense providing an integrated 'theory' of concept mapping,\ngive a view of when and why the use of concept mapping might be effective in some situa-\ntions and not in others, and how different concept mapping tools differ in the claims they are\nmaking about their educational use (Trapp, Reader and Hammond 1992).\nThe concept of auto-monitoring provides a related but higher-level perspective. Thus, as\nMcAleese argues, it links the areas of reflection, meta-cognition and concept mapping. It also\nprovides a process view of the stages involved in concept mapping (McAleese, Figure 2).\nThere is perhaps some theoretical leverage here. (McAleese wisely steers clear of the tempt-\ning but fallacious argument that maps are good for learning because they reflect structures in\nthe head in some way - this fallacy is analysed by McKendree and Reader 1994.) However,\nMcAleese is claiming more than this: it is not just that concept mapping can be a rather\neffective way of learning because it requires explication and reflection; the claim (as I\nunderstand it) is that concept mapping helps students develop auto-monitoring techniques and\nso enhance their critical thinking skills. While acknowledging that this might be the case, I\nhave yet to see either any evidence or a persuasive theoretical argument that supports it. There\nhave, after all, been many contenders for this educational equivalent of the philosopher's\nstone, from Latin grammar to Logo programming. Whether or not concept mapping does\nassist in the development of thinking skills (over and above providing a specific technique for\nhelping lay out one's knowledge) is still an open empirical question.\nIt is here that I have a slightly uncomfortable feeling of circularity. To simplify the argument:\ncritical thinking skills depend substantially on reflection, self-monitoring and gaining an\noverview, in short on auto-monitoring; concept mapping is a set of activities which both\nrequires and develops auto-monitoring; therefore concept mapping develops critical thinking\nskills. But is the concept of auto-monitoring as yet sufficiently well-defined or robust to serve\nas the bridge? The flaw is that none of these three concepts (thinking skills, auto-monitoring\nor concept mapping) is unitary, and the links between them are strictly hypothetical. Thinking\ninvolves a complex amalgam of different skills, which have to be appropriately mobilized\n(implicitly or explicitly), depending on the situation. As McAleese points out, auto-monitor-\ning as an 'executive control' is likely to involve a range of mental procedures. And concept\n49\nDavid Jonassen and Rose Marra Mindtoolsfor representing knowledge\nmapping supports a diverse range of learning and comprehension tasks. The hypothesis is\ntherefore a challenging one, though not yet proven. But perhaps I have gone further than\nMcAleese is claiming. I am certainly happy with his view of auto-monitoring as a 'learning\narena' in which the learner can be aware of and manipulate learning activities.\nReferences\nHammond, N.V.
