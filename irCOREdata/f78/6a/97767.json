Introduction\n[2] Odd nitrogen produced in the mesosphere or thermo-\nsphere by energetic particle precipitation (EPP-NOx) can be\ntransported to the stratosphere where it chemically perturbs\nozone (O3) distributions [e.g., Lope\u00b4z-Puertas et al., 2005;\nRandall et al., 1998, 2001, 2005; Seppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al., 2004,\n2007]. Changes in O3 can further lead to changes in\ntemperature and ultimately in atmospheric dynamics, both\nof which are important to the global climate [see, e.g.,\nBrasseur and Solomon, 2005, chapter 4]. A chemistry-\nclimate model study by Rozanov et al. [2005] examined\nthe effect of continuous, low intensity, electron precipitation\non the atmosphere. They predicted that the EPP-NOx\nincreases would result in up to 30% annual ozone decreases\nin the polar stratosphere. This would lead to cooling of the\npolar middle stratosphere by up to 2 K, with detectable\nchanges in the surface air temperature (SAT). One possible\nmechanism connecting the EPP-NOx and the changes at\nsurface level could be coupling through planetary wave\nbreaking [Song and Robinson, 2004]: If the ozone changes\nwere significant enough to affect stratospheric winds so that\nbreaking of vertically propagating planetary-scale Rossby\nwaves from the troposphere would be affected [Hartley et\nal., 1998], this breaking could drive the downward propa-\ngation of Northern Annular Mode-like patterns which\nwould ultimately be seen in the Surface Air Temperatures\n[Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999]. Model results are in deed\nshowing increasing evidence that stratospheric processes are\nable to affect surface level climate: Turner et al. [2009]\nsuggest that stratospheric ozone levels are likely effecting\nsea ice extent trends in the Southern polar region. The\nresults of Rozanov et al. [2005] indicate that the magnitude\nof the atmospheric response from EPP could potentially\nexceed the effects arising from variations of solar UV flux.\nIn this paper, we test the validity of the model results by\ncomparing observed mid-high latitude SATs in years with\ndiffering levels of geomagnetic activity.\n[3] Previous observational investigations of the relation-\nship between geomagnetic activity and climate are incon-\nclusive as to the role of EPP-NOx. Boberg and Lundstedt\n[2002] found a correlation between the solar wind and the\nNorth Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index [e.g., Hurrell et al.,\n2003]. In accordance with recent practice, we hereinafter\nuse the term Northern Annular Mode (NAM) to refer to this\nmode of atmospheric variability, in which the surface\npressure resembles an annulus, with a large negative center\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, A10312, doi:10.1029\/2008JA014029, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Physical Sciences Division, British Antarctic Survey (NERC),\nCambridge, UK.\n2Also at Earth Observation, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki,\nFinland.\n3Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and Department of\nAtmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder,\nColorado, USA.\n4Physical-Meteorological Observatory\/World Radiation Center, Davos,\nSwitzerland.\n5Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, Eidgenoo\u00a8ssische\nTechnische Hochschule, Zurich, Switzerland.\n6Department of Physics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2008JA014029$09.00\nA10312 1 of 10\nover the pole and two positive centers at lower latitudes\nover the Atlantic and Pacific. Boberg and Lundstedt [2002]\nattributed this correlation to the influence on the troposphere\nof a change in geomagnetic activity caused by a solar wind-\ninduced change to the ionospheric global electric circuit.\nThey did not, however, relate the geomagnetic activity to\nEPP. Thejll et al. [2003] found significant correlations in the\nnorthern hemisphere (NH) wintertime between the Ap\ngeomagnetic activity index and the NAM from 1973 to\n2000, but did not account for solar irradiance variations that\nmight have affected the correlations. Lu et al. [2008]\nshowed statistically significant correlations between the\nAp index and stratospheric circulation during spring that\ndescended in altitude from month to month, but suggested\nthat these were inconsistent with an EPP-NOx mechanism.\nLangematz et al. [2005] incorporated an idealized EPP-NOx\nsource in their climate model and found that once trans-\nported to the stratosphere, the EPP-NOx modified the ozone\nresponse to the 11-year solar irradiance cycle. Their model\nresults revealed a positive dipole upper stratospheric ozone\nsignal at high latitudes, but also indicated a negative ozone\nsignal at equatorial latitudes, where the simulated EPP-NOx\nlevels were overestimated, compared with observations.\nRecently Austin et al. [2008] studied the 11-year solar cycles\nin ozone and temperature using several coupled chemistry\nclimate models. Among other things, they considered the\nimportance of upper atmospheric effects and concluded that,\nunlike the results of Langematz et al. [2005], EPP-NOx was\nnot required to simulate the tropical ozone signal.\n[4] According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange [IPCC, 2007] \u2018\u2018More research to investigate the\neffects of solar behavior on climate is needed before the\nmagnitude of solar effects on climate can be stated with\ncertainty.\u2019\u2019 While the IPCC focuses on the effects of\nchanging solar irradiance, they also note that there might\nbe other mechanisms through which the Sun can couple to\nthe Earth\u2019s climate [IPCC, 2007, Chapter 1]. In this paper\nwe utilize meteorological analyses to investigate the possi-\nble influence of variations in geomagnetic activity on SATs\nin both hemispheres; we control for solar irradiance vari-\nability and discuss other possible sources of variability that\nmight also affect SATs.\n2. Description of Data and Method\n[5] The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather\nForecast (ECMWF) ERA-40 data set, described in detail\nby Uppala et al. [2005], is a reanalysis of meteorological\nobservations extending from September 1957 to August\n2002. The data set is not recommended for SH use prior to\n1979 due to a lack of observational data, so our SH ERA-40\nanalysis is limited to the years 1979\u20132002. To extend our\nanalysis beyond 2002 we utilize operational meteorological\ndata also provided by the ECMWF. The operational data\nused here covers the period from 2002 to January 2007. The\ncombination of these two data sets will be henceforth\nreferred to as extended ERA-40. For our SAT analysis we\nuse the air temperature at ground level, on a horizontal grid\nof 2.5\u0002 (lat) and 5\u0002 (lon).\n[6] The atmosphere is affected by several different types\nof particle precipitation. This includes both electron and\nproton precipitation, and the sources can vary over a wide\nrange of energies from high energy particles from the Sun\n(e.g., Solar Proton Events) to auroral energy precipitation.\nTo incorporate such a wide range of particle energies in our\nanalysis, we have chosen to use the geomagnetic activity\nindex Ap [Mayaud, 1980] as a proxy for the overall EPP\nlevel, although the amount of EPP-NOx reaching the strato-\nsphere will also be modulated by the prevailing meteoro-\nlogical conditions [Randall et al., 2006]. While there appear\nto be highly sufficient climatologies of low energy electrons\n(<20 keV), and direct observations of solar proton events\nsince the late 1970s, there is currently insufficient knowl-\nedge concerning the precipitation of medium and high\nenergy (>20 keV) electrons into the atmosphere to enable\nthe kind of analysis we describe in this study using the\nextended ERA-40 data set. To account for the time taken for\nthe EPP-NOx, originally produced in the mesosphere or\nthermosphere, to descend to the stratosphere, we average\nthe Ap values over a 4-month period starting two months\nprior to the surface air temperature examination months\n[e.g., Siskind et al., 2000; Seppa\u00a8la\u00a8 et al., 2007]. Using\n4 month averages for Ap and 3 months for the temperature\nwith a time lag of 2 months for the delays caused by the\ndescent of NOx, while the overlapping time windows take\ninto account mechanisms that could link Ap and SAT more\nrapidly. To test for variations caused by solar irradiance\nchanges, we will also undertake some analysis by subdivid-\ning the average wintertime Ap index according to the annual\naverage solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7, [10\u000222 W m\u00022\nHz\u00021]), commonly used to indicate the solar cycle phase.\nThe SAT results presented in the next section were similar\nwhether an annual average or shorter (DJF) F10.7 was used.\nFigure 1.

The panels on the left show\nall the years, including those years which will be excluded\nin the following analysis in some cases. Years which have\npossible affects from volcanic eruptions are shown in\nblue, and are always excluded from our subsequent analy-\nsis. In addition, years when a major Sudden Stratospheric\nWarming (SSW [Kuroda, 2008]) occurred in the NH during\nthe winter season (November\u2013January) are shown in red\n[see, e.g., Manney et al., 2005]. We will investigate the\neffect of these SSWs to the results. We note here that,\naccording to Figure 1, there appears to be no relation\nbetween the SSW occurrence and Ap. In the SH, there are\nno known SSWs during the winter season (June\u2013August)\nand thus we do not consider the SH SSW further. The\npanels on the right show the remaining years after the\nvolcanic and SSW cases are excluded. As a first test we\nsimply group the years into high and low Ap regimes\naccording to the average Ap \u00b1 5% as shown in Figure 1.\nWe call these Case N1 (11 years of high Ap, 13 years of low\nAp) and S1 (8 years of high Ap, 15 years of low Ap) for the\nNH and SH respectively. Further, to control for solar\nirradiance variations over the solar cycle, we selected a\nsubset of only years with low F10.7 values (65\u2013120, Case\nN2, NH), and high (180\u2013220, Case S2, SH) F10.7 values.\nThese subsets are selected so that they have as large\nvariation of the Ap, with respect to the average Ap shown\nin Figure 1, as possible. For each case this resulted in\nrepresentatively high and low Ap values for a limited F10.7\nsolar irradiance variation. The corresponding years for high\n(low) Ap are 1961, 1974, 1975, 1985, 1994, 1995, 2004,\n2005 (1962, 1965, 1966, 1971, 1972, 1977, 1987, 1996,\n1997, 1998, 2006) for Case N2; and 1981, 1989, 1990,\n2000 (1979, 1980, 2001, 2002) for Case S2. Note that NH\nwinters are referred to as 1961 for 1960\/1961, etc. Details of\nthe different cases mentioned above are given in Table 1.\nThe F10.7 flux grouping could be different for the two\nhemispheres as it is not critical for our analysis to select the\nyears from a particular solar cycle phase, as long as the\nF10.7 is limited to minimize the solar cycle induced\nvariation in the SATs. The reason for selecting low F10.7\nyears in the NH case N2 and high F10.7 years in the SH\ncase S2 is that with these F10.7 value limitations we are\nable to have as much deviation for the Ap values (between\nlow and high Ap years) as possible, while at the same time\nhaving as large number of years above and below the\naverage Ap as possible, this holding also after SSW and\nvolcanic years have been removed.\n3. Results\n[8] Figure 2 shows the Case N1 differences (DSAT)\nbetween the seasonally (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) averaged\nSATs for the high Ap minus low Ap years, when the SSW\nyears are included. Note that to aid comparison of the\nfollowing figures (Figures 2\u20137, 9, 10) we have used\nidentical color palette scalings (from \u00025 K to +5 K) for\nall of the maps. In Figure 3 we repeat the analysis but have\nexcluded the major SSW years as shown in Figure 1 (top\nright), as major SSWs are known to affect the tropospheric\nclimate [see, e.g., Kuroda, 2008, and references therein].\nWe calculated confidence levels for each case using the\nTable 1.

The 90% and 95% confidence levels are\nshown in the DSAT figures. Both Figures show similar DJF\nDSAT patterns, with warming over the Northern Eurasian\ncontinent and cooling over the Greenland area. When the\nSSW years were excluded the statistically significant areas\nincreased and the temperature variability increased to \u00024.5\nK over Greenland and to 4 K over Northern Eurasia.\n[9] Figures 4 and 5 show the Case N2 (controlled for\nsolar irradiance variation) differences (DSAT) between the\nseasonally averaged SATs for the high Ap minus low Ap\nyears with and without the SSW years, respectively. As in\nCase N1, Case N2 in DJF shows warming over the Eurasian\ncontinent and northern North America, and the patterns\nextend in area and become somewhat more intense when\nSSWs are excluded. This might be as a result of more stable\nvortex conditions aiding downward propagation of the\nsignals. The alternating cooling\/warming pattern seen in\nFigures 2\u20135 resembles the model results of Rozanov et al.\n[2005], who suggest that it is typical for enhanced EPP-NOx\nin the presence of enhanced polar vortex intensity. Similar\nstructure in the surface level temperature anomaly is ob-\nserved for the wintertime Northern Annular Mode (NAM)\n[e.g., see Figure 13 in Hurrell et al., 2003], suggesting that\nvariations in the Ap may modulate the preexisting NAM.\nThe pattern seen in DJF appears to subside during the spring\nmonths and disappears by summer (JJA). For Case N2 a\nnew pattern begins to emerge again in SON, which in these\nseasonal averages has little resemblance to the DFJ patterns.\nIt should be noted, however, that monthly averages (not\nshown because of their lower statistical significance) show\nlarge regions where DSAT approaches \u00b14 K in October and\nNovember, with the Case N2 pattern in November being\nvery similar to December, but offset in location. This\nsuggests that the physical mechanism responsible for the\nDJF differences could have started as early as October.\n[10] Figures 6 and 7 are analogous to Figures 3 and 5, but\nfor the southern hemisphere Cases S1 and S2. As in Cases N1\nand N2, there are alternating patterns of warming and cooling\nin wintertime (JJA)DSAT; there is also substantial cooling in\nthe fall (MAM). The maximum JJA DSAT is \u00035 K in the\nwestern part of the Antarctic region, in the Antarctic Penin-\nsula and the Amundsen Sea. The JJA DSAT pattern is\nsomewhat similar to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in\nterms of warming (<1 K) in the Antarctic Peninsula region,\nbut inconsistent with SAM-induced cooling elsewhere over\nthe continent [Thompson and Wallace, 2000]. The cooling\nover the continent observed in the fall (MAM) is more\nconsistent with the SAM pattern.\n[11] Next we compare the year-to-year SAT variability in\nspecific regions directly with Ap variability; although, due\nto the complexity of atmospheric processes one would not\nexpect any connection between geomagnetic activity and\nthe surface temperature variability to necessarily be the\nmost dominant influence from year-to-year. This is one of\nour main reasons for attempting to do a statistical study. For\nthe comparison of the temporal variability of the SAT and\nFigure 3.

The first\nregion is that between latitudes 60\u0002N\u201370\u0002N and longitudes\n45\u0002E\u201360\u0002E (corresponding to positive DSAT region shown\nas a red dashed box in Figures 2 and 3) and the second\nregion between latitudes 60\u0002N\u201370\u0002N and longitudes\n60\u0002W\u201330\u0002W (corresponding to negative DSAT region\nshown as a blue dashed box in Figures 2 and 3). The\ncorrelation plots for the two regions are shown in Figure 8.\nThe panels on the left present the correlation of the values\nwith Ap on the x axis and the SAT values on the y axis and\nthe panels on the right present the year-to-year variability of\nboth parameters. The panels on the right show the DJF SAT\nand the ONDJ Ap as a function of time to allow a better\nvisualization of the year-to-year variability of these two\nparameters. The top panels correspond to the positive region\nand the bottom panels to the negative region in Figures 2\nand 3. Volcanic and SSW years are indicated (left) with\ncolor as before. For the positive region the correlation for all\nyears is \u00030.30. When volcanic and SSW years are excluded\nthe correlation increases slightly to \u00030.45. For the negative\nregion we find that the correlation for all years is weakly\nnegative at \u0003\u00020.20 increasing slightly to \u0003\u00020.32 with the\nexclusion of volcanic and SSW years. The correlation\nincreasing slightly with the exclusion of volcanic and\nSSW years might reflect the exclusion of the SSW years\nleading to inclusion of years with more stable polar vortex;\nThis could potentially affect the probability of any signals\noriginating from higher altitudes reaching the surface level.\n[12] We further examined the consistency of NH DJF\nDSAT patterns using daily ground station SAT measure-\nments [see Klein Tank et al., 2002]. Nine ground stations\nlocated in Greenland, Norway, and Finland were selected.\nThe Greenland stations were located in the area of negative\nextended ERA-40 DSAT in DJF shown in Figure 3, while\nthe stations in Norway and Finland were located in the area\nof positive DSAT as seen in Figure 5. Table 2 gives the\naverage ground station temperatures and DSAT (high Ap\nminus low Ap) for DJF of both Case N1 and Case N2 years.\nConsistent with the extended ERA-40 shown in Figures 2\u2013\n5, ground station DSAT is negative for Greenland and\npositive elsewhere, the Finland stations having a high\nstatistical significance. The results indicate low statistical\nsignificance for Greenland in Case N2 and Norway in Case\nN1. This would appear to agree with Figures 5 and 3,\nrespectively, which show that these regions have DSAT\nclose to 0 K with low statistical significance. These results\nfrom the ground stations\u2019 data indicate that the NH DJF\nDSAT patterns are likely not artifacts of the ERA-40\nreanalysis data set.\n[13] As a further extended ERA-40 consistency check, we\nrepeated the SAT analysis using the National Center for\nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) data set; we find that the\nDSAT patterns from the NCEP analysis agree with the\nextended ERA-40 data (not shown).\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Atmospheric Variability\n[14] Attribution ofDSAT patterns to geomagnetic activity\nvariations requires ruling out other sources of variability. In\nthe analysis presented above we focused on minimizing\nFigure 5. Northern hemisphere seasonal differences in SAT (DT = High Ap \u0002 Low Ap) for Case N2, no\nSSW years included.\nFigure 6.

We\nalso considered the effects of major SSWs and volcanic\neruptions. Here we consider four other processes: the Quasi\nBiennial Oscillation (QBO), the El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscilla-\ntion (ENSO), NAM, and SAM. We have also considered the\npossibility that our results could be affected by slow\nvariations in Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) influencing\ntropospheric temperatures and that there might be a random\ncorrelation between the SST and geomagnetic activity.\nHowever, determining SST effects on the DSATs discussed\nin this paper is a complicated task and therefore we will not\nconsider any possible SST effect further, but will be mindful\nof it.\n[15] Since large DSAT values were found in winter\nmonths in both hemispheres, we focus on winter. To\naccount for possible time lags, we compared indices for\nthese sources of atmospheric variation during high- and\nlow-Ap years averaged in 3-month increments during the\nmonths of October\u2013February for NH Cases N1 and N2, and\nApril\u2013August for SH Cases S1 and S2. The results of this\ncomparison are presented in Table 3. To put the differences\ninto context, Table 3 also gives the minimum, maximum,\nand standard deviation (s) of each index from 1950 to 2007.\n[16] The results in Table 3 suggest that the QBO, ENSO,\nand SAM are not primarily responsible for the differences\nseen in Figures 3 and 5\u20137. In all but one of these cases, the\nindex differences are significantly less than s. The one\nFigure 7.

In this case, however the Case\nS1 difference is opposite in sign to Case S2; that the DSAT\npatterns for Cases S1 and S2 are similar suggests, therefore,\nthat QBO variations are not the cause of these patterns.\n[17] The situation is more complex for the NAM. The\nNAM index difference is on the order of s in all 3-month\naverages except OND in Case N1 and N2. In all cases, the\nNAM index differences are positive, indicating that DSAT\nvalues in Figures 3 and 5 would take on characteristics of\nthe positive NAM phase. In the positive NAM phase,\nGreenland tends to be cooler and northern Eurasia warmer\nthan otherwise. It should be noted here that, unlike NAM\ngeopotential and zonal wind patterns, the NAM SAT pattern\nis not zonally symmetric [Thompson and Wallace, 2000;\nHurrell et al., 2003]. This is consistent with the DJF DSAT\npatterns seen in Figures 3 and 5. Hurrell et al. [2003] show\nwarming (cooling) of up to about 2 K (1.4 K) in northern\nEurasia (near Greenland) for a one-unit increase in the\nNAM index during December\u2013March. Maximum DJF\nDSAT values in Figure 5 are about twice this size for both\nCases 1 and 2. Attributing the observed DSAT values to the\nNAM requires that \u00b14 K changes result from index changes\nof \u00031; such changes are not ruled out by Hurrell et al.\n[2003], since their \u00032 K changes represented averages over\nyears 1900\u20132002.\n4.2. Temperature Variability Tests\n[18] Here we examine the possibility that the observed\nDSAT patterns in the NH and SH could simply be formed\nrandomly. We do this by selecting the sets of years, for which\nthe DSAT are calculated, using different, Ap-independent\ncriteria.\n[19] First we test the consistency of the patterns seen in\nFigures 2\u20135 by grouping the NH years according to the\nF10.7 flux and calculating the difference between years with\nhigher and lower F10.7 values. The higher value years are\ndefined as those with F10.7 > 150 and the lower value years\nas those with F10.7 < 150. Figure 9 presents the NH\nseasonal SAT differences when SSW years were excluded.\nThe main features in Figure 9 are a DJF warm pattern in\nmidlatitude Eurasia and North America and Greenland and\na cool pattern in Northern Eurasia. Other seasons do not\nshow statistically significant patterns. When Figure 9 is\ncompared with the earlier Figure 3, it is evident that the\ntemperature variability patterns differ, and that the temper-\nature range in Figure 3 is nearly twice that of Figure 9. This\nsuggests that the SAT variability patterns of Figure 3 are not\ninduced by the variability in solar flux, caused by the 11-year\nsolar cycle.\n[20] As can be seen from Figure 1 (left), in the SH the\nsolar F10.7 radio flux i.e. the solar cycle phase and the\ngeomagnetic activity index Ap are slightly more correlated\nthan in the NH, in the sense that in the SH the lowest Ap\nvalues correspond to low F10.7 values. Thus simply group-\ning the SH years according to the F10.7 as we did for the\nNH would not provide an Ap-independent test. As a test of\nthe SH temperature variability pattern we therefore imposed\na linear division of all the years from low Ap-low F10.7 to\nhigh Ap-high F10.7. This divides all SH years into two\ngroups, one group including 1980, 2001, 2002, etc., and the\nother group including 1994, 1995, 2005, etc. The seasonal\nTable 2.

This Figure 10 is to be contrasted with Figures 6\nand 7 showing the High\u0002 Low Ap index patterns. Figure 10\nJJA shows a weak (<1.5 K) warming pattern placed between\nthe warm and cool patterns of Figures 6 and 7. As in the NH,\nthe magnitude of the JJA SAT variability (\u00022 to 1.5 K) is\nsmaller than for the High \u0002 Low Ap (up to \u00025 to 5 K). This\nwould suggest that the SAT variability patterns of Figures 6\nand 7 are not induced by random variability in solar flux and\nthe Ap.\n5. Summary\n[21] Using the ERA-40 data set from 1957 to 2002 and\nECMWF operational meteorological data from 2002 on-\nward, we find statistically significant differences in winter-\ntime polar SAT between years with high and low Ap index.\nThe changes occur in both hemispheres and are on the order\nof \u00b14.5 K. In the NH the changes are more evident when\nyears with Sudden Stratospheric Warmings occurring during\nthe midwinter months are excluded from the analysis. These\nresults agree with previous model predictions of EPP effects\nin the lower atmosphere [Rozanov et al., 2005]. We con-\nclude that geomagnetic activity is a likely cause of the SAT\nchanges, although possible effects from the NAM introduce\na high level of uncertainty in this conclusion. Random\nsources of atmospheric variability that are not quantified\nby the indices evaluated here (QBO, ENSO, NAM and\nSAM) can also affect the results. For instance, in the SH\nsignificant temperature variations appear to take place\nmainly in the West Antarctic region, the area where the\nAntarctic interannual variability has been reported to be\nlargest [see Lachlan-Cope et al., 2001, and references\ntherein].\n[22] The empirical analysis performed here does not\nallow us to identify a mechanism by which geomagnetic\nactivity would affect the SAT. Rozanov et al. [2005] suggest\nthat SAT effects follow EPP-NOx-catalyzed O3 depletion\nthat leads to circulation changes including a stronger polar\nvortex. We observe the largest changes in the polar region\nduring winter, when the stratospheric NOx catalytic cycle is\nweak or inoperative, although noncatalytic O3 depletion by\nreaction with EPP-NO will contribute to the changes. If the\nwintertime ozone changes were significant enough, one\npossible mechanism connecting the EPP-NOx and the\nchanges at surface level could be coupling through plane-\ntary wave breaking: Ozone changes could affect stratospher-\nic winds so that breaking of vertically propagating planetary\nscale Rossby waves from the troposphere would be affected,\nthis breaking could drive the downward propagation of\nNAM-like patterns which would ultimately be seen in the\nSAT. The resemblance of the NH DSAT patterns to the\ntypical cell-like NAM pattern effects in the meteorological\ndata used here and the similarity of model predictions of\nRozanov et al. [2005] to the positive NAM SAT pattern\nperhaps indicates a common mechanism between the NAM\nand changes induced by geomagnetic variations. The origin\nof the annular mode patterns is not yet fully understood,\nFigure 9.

It remains uncertain why the\nmeteorological data implies a stronger surface temperature\nresponse than the modeling, but one possible source for the\ndifference could arise from the year-to-year variability in the\nEPP source and the particle energy limitations of the data\nset used by Rozanov et al. [2005]; The particle data used in\nthe modeling represented a low geomagnetic activity year\n(1987, see Figure 1) and was for limited energy range only.\nAs separation of atmospheric response for the forcing from\ndifferent sources will always be challenging from observa-\ntional data, it would be important to put effort in examining\nthese effects through models including realistic middle and\nupper atmosphere representation, coupling mechanisms for\nthe atmospheric layers and ever more realistic geomagnetic\nactivity (EPP) sources. Through model work we will be able\nto look in detail into the mechanisms communicating\nsignatures from high altitudes all the way to the surface\nlevel. This presents a future challenge to atmospheric\nmodeling work, but it is equally important to note that in\norder to be able to reliably model the response from\ngeomagnetic sources we also need better understanding\nof the different particle sources: This provides a challenge\nto the scientific community working on solar-terrestrial\nphysics.\n[23] If true, the EPP feedback would be complex, since\nstrong vortices lead to large EPP effects due to NOx\nsequestration [Randall et al., 2007], but stratospheric warm-\nings can also be followed by large EPP effects due to\nenhanced mesospheric descent [Siskind et al., 2007]. How-\never, our analysis suggests that years with SSWs produce\nweaker correlations between geomagnetic activity and\nDSAT.\n[24] Acknowledgments.
