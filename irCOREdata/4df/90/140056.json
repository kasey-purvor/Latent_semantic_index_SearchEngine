These are coalescing around the issue of whether or not marketing\ndelivers shareholder value. One promising line of enquiry explores customer lifetime value\nand the profitable management of these relationships. Although helpful, this approach fails to\nmake the final link with shareholder value since customer lifetime value is still essentially a\nprofit or cash flow measure and does not fully account for customer risk. This paper\ndescribes empirical research which explores differing approaches to measuring customer\nrisk and the creation of shareholder value through customer relationship management\n(CRM). We develop a customer relationship scorecard which proves an innovative tool for\nmanagers to use in determining the risks in their customer relationships and developing risk\nmitigation strategies. The scorecard is then used to forecast retention probabilities, from\nwhich a risk-adjusted customer lifetime value is calculated. Both the scorecard and the\ncalculations have an impact on the CRM practices of the customer relationship managers.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, an enhanced consideration of customer risk and returns is an\nimportant additional step towards demonstrating that marketing creates shareholder value.\nKeywords: customer lifetime value; customer risk; customer relationship management;\nshareholder value\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n4\n1. Introduction\nThe emergence of relationship marketing with its emphasis on customer retention has sparked\nconsiderable interest in how these customer relationships can be managed more effectively\nsince they are now regarded as one of the firm\u2019s primary assets (Gupta et al. 2004; Hunt\n1997; Kutner and Cripps 1997; Srivastava et al. 1998). Traditional accounting practices focus\nmainly on measuring tangible assets as a statutory requirement on the balance sheet.\nHowever, nowadays it is more usual for intangible assets such as brand, employee and\ncustomer relationships to be the critical and often dominant determinants of shareholder value\n(Amir and Lev 1996). Given that customer relationship management (CRM) is becoming a\ncore business strategy (Buttle 2004) with investments ranging in value from $60m to over\n$100m for a highly complex installation (Ebner et al. 2002), the business risk and returns of\nCRM investments needs to be fully quantified. However, it is not purely the financial risk to\nthe firm that needs to be mitigated; research suggests that some 20 per cent of users of recent\nCRM installations report actual damage to long-standing customer relationships (Rigby et al.\n2002). So, as firms develop their marketing strategies based on the principles of customer\nretention by forging deeper, closer relationships with key customers (Reichheld 1996;\nReichheld and Sasser 1990), the risk and returns of these customer relationships also need to\nbe assessed more systematically. In his seminal paper, Doyle (2000a) argues that, as\nmarketing is the custodian of customer insights and responsible for customer relationships\ngenerally, it needs to take the lead in developing more transparent metrics for measuring\nthese risk and returns. He also argues that since marketing investments are often directed\ntowards building intangible, off-balance sheet assets that can be difficult to quantify, the\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n5\nchallenge for senior marketers is to demonstrate to their Boards how effectively they are\ncontributing to shareholder value creation1.\nWith this research agenda in mind, Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml (2004a) have developed and\ntested a strategic framework that enables a firm\u2019s competing marketing strategy options to be\ntraded-off on the basis of projected financial returns. Using a Markov switching-matrix\napproach which accounts for competitive brand switching and discounted customer lifetime\nvalue (CLV) measures, the authors are able to calculate the returns on marketing investments\nacross five consumer markets. Based upon changes in customer equity relative to the\nincremental expenditures needed to produce these changes, their \u2018what if\u2019 evaluations of\nmarketing returns represents a very significant advance in enabling marketing management to\ndevelop greater financial legitimacy and, consequently, to make more informed choices about\ntheir investment decisions. However, by their own admission, their pioneering work does\nhave some limitations such as the inability to incorporate multi-product cross-selling options\nor to accommodate temporal changes in the size of markets under study. In a subsequent\npaper, Rust et al (2004b) develop a meta-analysis of marketing productivity in which they\ncatalogue the methods proposed in the last ten years for assessing how marketing\nexpenditures add to shareholder value. While they conclude that it is possible to link\nmarketing value-add to shareholder value in theory, they call upon the research community to\ncarry out further, essential research to increase the empirical validity and practicability of\nsuch methods.\n1 For the purposes of this paper, we adopt Doyle\u2019s (2000b) definition of shareholder value which he states\nincreases when senior managers make decisions that increase the discounted value of all future cash flows.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n6\nIn this paper, we respond to the challenges raised by Rust et al. by presenting a conceptual\nframework and an empirical study that attempt to link the risk and returns from customer\nrelationship management (CRM) with shareholder value.\nFirst, we discuss this framework which we argue complements the pioneering work by Rust\nand co-workers (2004a) as our study is concerned with the returns of CRM investments in a\nbusiness\u2013to\u2013business context rather than the marketing returns on investments such as\nadvertising and loyalty programs in consumer markets. We are also able to address the issue\nof cross-selling to customers from a multi-product portfolio and to estimate revenue streams\nover time in dynamic market situations; two of the limitations highlighted in the Rust (2004a)\npaper mentioned earlier.\nWe then briefly outline our methodology involving a collaborative case study approach\nwithin a major business-to-business insurer and conclude that an important aspect of risk in a\nfirm\u2019s relationships with its major accounts is not the risk of financial default but the risk of a\ntotal or partial loss of the relationship. We propose a method of evaluating this aspect of risk\nthrough a customer relationship risk scorecard which we then use to develop a risk-based\napproach to customer lifetime value (CLV) calculations.\nThe theoretical implications of our paper relate to the efficacy of CRM in managing\ncustomer relationship risk, and to the use of risk-adjusted CLVs so that marketing is better\nable to deliver shareholder value. The managerial implications are that this scorecard can help\ncustomer relationship managers to evaluate and reduce risk in their individual accounts and\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n7\nacross the key account portfolio generally so a more effective CRM strategy can be\ndeveloped.\n2. Research Rationale and Conceptual Framework\nWhile it is axiomatic that effective marketing is closely dependent upon understanding\ncustomer motivation, behaviors and purchasing styles, it is perhaps less well established how\nmarketing strategies, particularly CRM, should be adapted as more is discovered about the\nrisk and returns of particular customers and what impact these customized CRM strategies\nhave on shareholder value creation. For example, simple customer retention strategies need to\nbe adjusted as firms come to understand that they destroy value if the costs of retention\nexceed the benefits (Reinartz and Kumar 2002; Thomas, Reinartz and Kumar 2004). Ryals\n(2005) presents striking evidence to suggest that by developing profitable customer retention\nstrategies with selected customers over time, for instance by targeting marginally unprofitable\ncustomers and either cross-selling to them and\/ or reducing their costs-to-serve, the firm\u2019s\noverall performance is likely to improve. As customers become ever more demanding, she\ncalls for further research on measuring customer profitability, risk and returns as well as into\nthe impact that customized CRM strategies have on shareholder value creation.\nEarlier studies in this area tend to focus on single-period customer profitability (e.g. Wilson\n1996) and customer lifetime value using a discount rate (Berger and Nasr 1998; Mulhern\n1999). However, linking marketing investments to shareholder value requires both the use of\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) rather than discount rates (Cornelius and Davies\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n8\n1997) and a measure of the risk and returns from customers (Dhar and Glazer 2003; Stahl,\nMatzler, and Hinterhuber 2003). Although Dhar and Glazer (2003) demonstrate a method of\nadjusting customer lifetime value for the riskiness of the customer, they use a method based\non financial portfolio theory; an approach that has proved controversial in its application to\nmarketing since it was originally proposed by Cardozo and Smith (1983; see the objections\nraised by Devinney, Stewart and Shocker 1985 and the response by Cardozo and Smith\n1985).\nRecently the issue of customer risk, expressed as the probability of securing customer\nlifetime value, has re-emerged alongside interest in customer equity measures and marketing\nreturns (Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml (2004a). As indicated earlier, these researchers\ndemonstrate an elegant statistical approach to measuring marketing returns in a data-rich,\nconsumer marketing environment. In contrast to this research, the work we report here deals\nwith business-to-business marketing in which the risk of the customer is assessed through key\naccount profiling so that the shareholder value generated by CRM investments can be\nestimated.\nIn essence, we argue that there are research gaps both in theory development and managerial\npractice which connect CRM investments with the creation (or destruction) of shareholder\nvalue. Specifically, these are the calculation of individual CLVs of major customers using\nWACC and a method of assessing customer relationship risk (Figure 1):\n-Insert Figure 1 about here-\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n9\n2.1 Single period customer profitability analysis (CPA)\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (1998) found that most firms measure customer profitability\nin a top-down way based on the level of sales, the increase in order volume and the size of\ntransactions. A frequently-encountered difficulty for companies wishing to measure customer\nprofitability is that management accounting and reporting systems have tended to reflect\nproduct profitability rather than customer profitability (Balachandran 2005). Where product\nprofitability is known, the direct product costs of customer purchases can be determined with\nreasonable accuracy. Indirect costs (principally the costs of sales, marketing and general\nadministration [SGA]) are then allocated across the customer base, often in proportion to the\ntotal sales of each customer.\nHowever, this approach assumes each customer uses equivalent amounts of company time\nand effort in relation to sales revenue; whereas some customers are just more costly to serve\nthan others, often due to their behavior. For instance, new customers may demand more\ninformation about products and service levels, seek to customize the offer as far as possible\nand then buy on a limited basis as a trial measure. The costs-to-serve of this customer,\nexcluding acquisition costs, point towards an overstatement of profitability in the period. By\ncontrast, customers who purchase on a regular basis and whose purchasing habits are routine\nand predictable, can be relatively easy to serve. Thus, the profitability of such customers\nstemming from a proportional allocation of costs can be understated.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n10\nA fundamental problem which applies to all current (and historical) customer profitability\nanalysis is that it does not necessarily act as a guide to the future (Reinartz and Kumar 2002;\nWilson 1996). This is a problem for CRM which aims to maximize the longer-term value of\nclose customer relationships and hence contribute to shareholder value (Zablah, Bellenger,\nand Johnston 2004). For this reason, customer lifetime value may be a more useful and\nappropriate measure of the value created by marketing.\n2.2 Customer lifetime value (CLV) using discount rates\nAs companies move towards relationship marketing strategies involving CRM, they need to\ndevelop a longer-term view of the value of their customer relationships than current data can\nprovide (Peppers and Rogers 1994; 1998; 2001). Effectively, marketers need to predict the\nfuture purchasing behavior of customers to arrive at their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n(Ryals 2002). CLV looks at what the retained customer is worth to the organization now,\nbased on the predicted future transactions and costs (Berger and Nasr 1998; Mulhern 1999).\nLooking forward to the value of future sales and costs (expressed as the present value of a\nstream of future profits) fits more comfortably with the development of CRM strategies than\ncurrent period profits (Dorman and Hasan 1996; Zablah, Bellenger and Johnston 2004). Also,\nforward-looking customer lifetime value measures are more consistent with the principles of\nshareholder value creation. To calculate the lifetime value of a customer, three types of\ninformation are needed: the anticipated lifetime of the customer relationship in months or\nyears; the profit in each future period adjusted for any customer-specific capital costs, such as\nmarketing and customized services; and an agreed discount rate (Berger and Nasr 1998;\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n11\nMulhern 1999). CLV analysis demonstrates that the value of the relationship with a customer\ncan be increased either by increasing the amount of profit (by increasing the revenue from the\ncustomer and\/or decreasing costs-to-serve) or by extending the relationship lifetime.\nUnfortunately, even if CLV calculations show a positive return, it is still possible that a\ncustomer relationship could destroy shareholder value. One reason is that commonly-used\nprofit measures do not necessarily reflect shareholder value creation because they do not take\ninto account the true cost of capital (Cornelius and Davies 1997; Koller 1994).\n2.3 CLV based on the WACC\nIn calculating profit using CLV, the cost of debt interest is usually deducted but not the (often\nhigher) cost of equity. A company\u2019s cost of capital is the weighted average of its cost of debt\nand its cost of equity (or WACC) determined by the return its investors require on the money\nthey invest in the business. The capital used by a business comes either from debt or from\nequity funding; thus the overall cost of capital for a business is the weighted average of the\ncost of its equity and the cost of its debt. It is only if the return on capital exceeds its cost of\ncapital that an investment creates shareholder value (Cornelius and Davies 1997; Lieber\n1996; Reimann 1990). Thus, using WACC as a basis for calculating the present value of\nfuture returns from customer relationships moves the CLV concept closer to direct\nshareholder value analysis.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n12\nEven with this refinement in the CLV calculation, there are still important aspects missing\nfrom the full measurement of CRM returns. For instance, little account has been given to the\nrisks associated with building lifetime relationships with key customers (Stahl, Matzler, and\nHinterhuber 2003) nor the dynamic relationship between CRM and the lifetime value of these\ncustomers (Ryals 2005).\n2.4 Risk of the individual customer\nRegarding customer risk assessment, CLV analysis \u2013 even WACC-adjusted measures \u2013 tends\nto reflect supplier risk more than the risk generated by their customers. As the fundamental\nsource of a business\u2019s cash flow, customers are a risky asset, particularly as the size and\npower of key customers continues to grow (McDonald et al. 1994) and businesses seek to\ndifferentiate through a greater degree of customization of their products, services and\nprocesses (Womack and Jones 2005). In other words, as marketing and sales make choices\nabout their CRM priorities, there is a need for a new approach to customer risk assessment.\nSo how should marketers adjust the CLV of a particular customer for risk? Many companies\nassess the risk of their customers using some form of risk or credit scoring. Risk scoring is an\neffective way of evaluating specific types of risk in a customer relationship, normally credit\nscoring to evaluate the risk of default (Hoogenberg and auf dem Brinke2004; Wagner 2004).\nHowever, defaulting on payments is only likely to be relevant in a minority of business-to-\nbusiness relationships and is a remote possibility in the relationships that suppliers have with\ntheir major customers. Also, credit scoring measures risk at a point in time and neither\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n13\nreflects the commercial possibilities over the relationship lifetime nor offers guidance to\nlonger-term relationship management. Although credit scoring has a role to play in managing\nthe financial risk in major business-to-business relationships, it needs to be dynamic to reflect\nthe changes in risk over time (Ryals 2002) and it may not reflect the true risk in the\nrelationship. In major customer relationships, other types of risk associated with a customer,\nparticularly the risk of defection or purchasing swings, may be far more of a risk but are not\ncaptured by traditional risk scoring.\nFor the purposes of developing CRM and shareholder value measures, we propose a different\ndefinition of risk that addresses relationship risk. The benefit of defining risk in this way is\nthat it offers managers the opportunity directly to diagnose the health of their relationships\nwith major customers for themselves (McNamara and Bromiley 1999). This evaluation can\ntake one of two forms.\n\uf0b7 The WACC discount rate used to calculate customer lifetime value can be further\nadjusted for the risk associated with that customer; or\n\uf0b7 The risk evaluation can be expressed as a probability of obtaining the forecast future\nrevenue stream from that particular customer.\nBoth methods will now be discussed.\n2.5 Adjusting discount rates to reflect individual customer risk\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n14\nDrawing on McNamara and Bromley\u2019s approach, an assessment of customer risk factors is\nbased upon a review of the company\u2019s CRM capabilities, general insights about their\ncustomers and other germane market conditions, such as growth potential, customer defection\nrates and competitive intensity. Each factor is then assigned an importance weighting and\ncustomers are scored against these factors. The weighted risk score for each customer is then\ncalculated relative to the average. So, a customer with a risk scorecard which is 50 % higher\nthan the average across the customer portfolio would be assigned a risk-adjusted discount rate\n50% greater than the WACC rate in calculating their CLV. A minor drawback of this method\nis that risk is calculated relative to the average of the account portfolio. Changes in this\nportfolio average (i.e. losing or gaining a major customer) may result in changes to the\napparent risk and returns of all remaining key accounts. A more substantial objection to this\napproach for major accounts is that unless the relationship lifetime is predicted to be very\nlong or the WACC is very high, even very large changes to the risk-adjusted discount rate\nwould have little impact on the actual customer lifetime value. In practice, most managers\nfind it difficult to predict customer lifetime value more than a few years ahead. These\nlimitations in the use of risk-adjusted WACC (or credit scoring) as the sole risk measure in a\ncustomer relationship have led us to develop a relationship risk scorecard.\n2.6 The relationship risk scorecard\nThe underlying concept behind the relationship risk scorecard is that the main risk in major\naccount relationships is the total loss of the customer or reduction in a customer\u2019s \u201cshare of\nwallet\u201d. The relationship risk scorecard method can be operationalized using a personal\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n15\nconstruct or critical incident analysis; CRM managers are asked to consider why certain\ncustomers defect and why others migrate. Analysis of the results produces a series of factors\nthat can be used to evaluate the riskiness of a relationship. These factors might include the\nnumber of contacts that customer has with the company, how warm the relationship is, etc.\nOnce the customer risk scorecard has been developed, it is then possible to assign a\nprobability to forecast profits in each future year of the customer\u2019s relationship lifetime.\nThus, rather than risk-adjusting the WACC, managers can adjust their forecasts of future\nrevenues of their individual customers by the estimated probability that these future revenues\nwill be achieved. Probability forecasting overcomes the objection to the low impact of risk-\nadjusting the WACC since changes in probability have a substantial impact on the value of\nthe customer.\n2.7 Optimizing shareholder return on a customer relationship\nBell and co-workers (2002) point out that, beyond estimating CLVs, there is the need to\noptimize shareholder value from each of these customer relationship through effective CRM\npractices. Clearly, how this shareholder return is optimized is totally dependent on a thorough\nunderstanding of the customer\u2019s strategy, its market position, and the supplier\u2019s own CRM\nskills and competencies. For instance, should a particular key account have a strong brand\nname in their market, the supplier\u2019s CRM strategy may be to seek to acquire new customers\nin this market through the customer\u2019s endorsement and by word-of-mouth referrals. In other\ninstances, a particularly innovative account may support the co-development of new products\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n16\nand services or help evaluate new product concepts. It may be simply that the biggest\naccounts are found to contribute the most economic value and should be managed to\nmaximize shareholder value on this basis.\nIn sum, the creation of shareholder value through CRM can only be managed effectively if\nthe company\u2019s CRM strategy is based upon an analysis of its key account portfolio; by\nmeasuring and managing risk-adjusted CLVs of key accounts individually to reflect\nshareholder gains (and losses). In optimizing the CRM investment across the portfolio, the\nlink between CRM strategy and shareholder value becomes more evident, less assumptive\nand provides a mechanism for risk reduction in decision making.\nIn the next section, we briefly outline the methodology that enables us to do this with a\nbusiness-to-business insurance company which manages a portfolio of key accounts in a\nnumber of different markets.\n3. Methodology\nOur research is about building and testing a new approach to assessing CRM risk, so the\nmethodology used is inductive theory discovery (Strauss and Corbin 1990). We selected a\ncollaborative case study approach which suits a descriptive and explanatory enquiry (Patton\nand Appelbaum 2003). However, the case study includes both quantitative as well as\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n17\nqualitative data (Yin 2002). A single participating company from the financial services\nindustry was selected to explore a defined process (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 2002). In case study\nresearch the context is important (Patton and Appelbaum 2003); the theoretical sample of\nindustry and participant company in the current research is based on an acceptance of the\nneed for risk measurement and a relative familiarity with risk and net present value concepts.\nThe participating company is a very large European business-to-business insurer and the\nresearch was carried out with its key account management (KAM2) team. Across the team,\nthere was a developing distinction between insurance risk (which was its main business and\nalready built in to its pricing and risk management process) and relationship risk (which was\nnot). It is this state of readiness among the team that makes the inductive methodology of\ncollaborative enquiry, using various one-one-one interviews and team-based workshops,\nappropriate (Boer, Gertson, Kaltoft and Nielsen 2005; Eden and Huxham 1996; Gummesson\n2000).\nThe key account portfolio studied consisted of a total of 18 major accounts of which it was\npossible to carry out risk evaluations on 10. All 10 had annual contractual relationships with\nthe insurer and all were managed by the KAM team throughout the research period of 9\nmonths. The key accounts operated in a variety of industry sectors, from building and hotels\nto chemicals manufacturing and charities. They all bought at least three business lines\n2 In this company, key account management provides the main marketing role and accounts for most of the\nmarketing expenditure.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n18\n(products) from this insurer and the total lifetime value of this key account portfolio exceeds\n\u00a350m.\n3.1 Developing the customer relationship risk scorecard\nA collaborative research process was used to develop the relationship risk scorecard. First,\nthe researchers carried out a review of current practices in risk evaluation of customers and\ncirculated a short document outlining the different approaches to risk evaluation described\nearlier in this paper. Then, the researchers and the KAM team agreed the research protocol.\nThis research protocol utilised an elicitation process based on Repertory Grid technique\n(Kelly 1955; 1969), which has been widely used in marketing and has been previously\napplied in a study of business-to-business risk management practices (Sparrow 1999). The\nname of each key account was written onto separate cards (Daniels, de Chernatony and\nJohnson 1995) and, in individual interviews, each KAM team member was presented with the\nnames of three key accounts. They were asked to say which of the three was the most risky,\nand why. This was repeated four times so that each of the key accounts was presented. To aid\nfurther probing, the four \u2018riskiest\u2019 accounts identified were presented in two random sets of\nthree cards and the interviewee again asked which was the riskiest and why. Finally, as a\ncheck on previous responses, each interviewees were asked to order all the cards in\ndescending order of risk (Daniels, de Chernatony and Johnson 1995).\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n19\nTo ensure that the widest possible definition of risk had been captured, similar interviews\nwere carried out with three senior managers, not part of the KAM team, who had extensive\nclient management responsibilities. At the end of all eight interviews, some open questions\nwere asked about what the participants thought made a customer relationship risky,\nspecifically probing for the factors that might cause their key accounts to leave or to migrate\npart of their business to a competitor. The participants were also prompted to discuss\nexamples. The purpose of the open questions and the examples was to ensure that all relevant\nrelationship risks were elicited and to aid the researchers in establishing a common language\nfor each of the risk factors. The results were discussed with the KAM team and a list of nine\nrelationship risk factors developed. These were grouped by general subject into a relationship\nrisk scorecard. We then worked with the KAMs to collect the information to populate the\nrelationship risk scorecard for each of the 10 accounts. In conjunction with the Senior\nActuary and the head of the KAM team, we subsequently assigned retention probability\nweightings to each of the factors on the scorecard.\nFinally, the probability weightings results of the relationship risk scorecard were fed back to\nthe KAM team and used as the basis for a series of workshop discussions to finalize the\nCLV-WACC calculations, the relationship risk scorecard and the CLV calculations for their\naccounts based on this scorecard. Throughout these discussions, new ideas for developing\nCRM strategies for retaining and acquiring customers also emerged.\n4. Findings and Discussion\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n20\n4.1 CLV using Discount Rate and WACC\nExtensive discussions with the insurer\u2019s Senior Actuary led to the calculation of a WACC of\n4.8% against the company\u2019s then discount rate of 12%. This rather unusual situation in which\nthe company\u2019s WACC was considerably lower than its discount rate needs some explanation.\nWACC is defined as (cost of debt x proportion of debt) plus (cost of equity x proportion of\nequity). The cost of debt and cost of equity reflect the lenders\u2019 views of the riskiness of\ninvesting in the company; WACC is externally determined. In this case, the low WACC\nindicated that lenders considered this to be a low risk business. The discount rate is\ndetermined internally and reflects the company\u2019s own view of its risk. At 12%, the discount\nrate was considerably higher than the cost at which the company could borrow, indicating a\nconservative approach to risk on the part of the insurer.\nFollowing the procedure described earlier (CLV using discount rate), CLVs were calculated\nusing both the regular discount rate of 12% and the WACC of 4.8% (Table 1).\n-Insert Table 1 about here-\nThe first finding was that varying the discount rate or WACC did not seem to have a major\nimpact on customer lifetime value. The difference between the total values of the customer\nportfolio calculated using a discount rate of 12% or a WACC of 4.8% for the average\ncustomer lifetime of 4 years was \u00a32,137,385.97 or 13.8%. The largest individual change was\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n21\nfor customer H, whose lifetime value changed by 21%. The smallest change was for\ncustomers C and F, whose lifetime value changed by 6% (Table 1, column 3). By contrast,\nthe lifetime value for the largest customer in the portfolio (I) was almost 30 times greater than\nthe value of the smallest customer (F). The small differences in lifetime value caused by the\nrecalculation using WACC were swamped by the much larger differences in value between\nthe accounts.\nThe reason that lifetime values calculated using WACC hardly differ from lifetime values\ncalculated using the discount rate, even when the discount rate is two and a half times greater\nthan the WACC, is due to the relatively short customer lifetimes predictions. The maximum\npredicted remaining lifetime was 6 years and the mean was just over 4 years. Mathematically,\nthe longer the predicted customer lifetime, the greater the impact of a change in discount rate\non the present-day value. However, in practice asking account managers or sales people to\npredict revenues and costs to serve over long time periods into the future is likely to be\nproblematic.\nWhile reflecting on these results, the KAMs made some intriguing comments that the risk of\nthe customer varies over time for reasons largely unconnected with financial risk. Therefore,\nrisk needed to be considered at the level of the individual customer and in terms of\nrelationship, not just financial, risk. This finding led to the development of a relationship risk\nscorecard.\n4.2 The customer relationship risk scorecard\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n22\nThe analysis of the eight semi-structured interviews showed that more than half of the factors\nidentified related to insurance risk (such as industry risk or whether the client had a dedicated\nRisk Manager) rather than relationship risk. Following further discussions with the KAM\nteam and their senior managers, the insurance risk factors were excluded. Nine customer\nrelationship risk factors were eventually identified. These were then grouped into one of three\ncategories:\n\uf0b7 The customer\u2019s overall relationship with the company (including other parts of the\ninsurer)\n\uf0b7 Account relationships\n\uf0b7 Knowledge of the customer.\nThis relationship risk scorecard was then used to analyze the 10 key accounts for which full\ndata were available (see Table 2 below). Where the relationship risk factor was subjective\n(factors 4, 5, 8, and 9), the key account manager for that account was asked to evaluate the\ncustomer relationship using a five-point scale. The last two columns of Table 2 show the\nmaximum and minimum values of the 9 risk factors found for the customers studied. In every\ncase the direction of risk is consistent: the minimum values always indicate higher\nrelationship risk and the maximum values indicate lower risk.\n-Insert Table 2 about here-\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n23\nThe first surprising finding is the degree of variation in key account management practices;\nfor example, there were very substantial differences between accounts in terms of their\noverall relationship with the company, number of products bought and the number of\npersonal contacts on both sides. A cross-comparison of the results for factors 6 and 7\nindicated that customers with the most contacts at the company are also those with whom the\ncompany had most contacts (i.e. the relationships tended to be either one-to-few or many-to-\nmany). It is possible that these results can be explained in terms of different kinds of KAM\nrelationship (McDonald, Millman and Rogers 1997). However, judging by the surprised\nreaction of the KAM team to these variations, the differences in customer relationships were\nnot intended and had arisen purely from differing approaches to account management across\nthe team. Certainly the disparity of results on factors 1 and 2 indicates areas of opportunity\nfor a more consistent CRM approach.\nAnother interesting result concerns the responses to the subjective factors 4, 5, 8, and 9 in\ntable 2. In all cases, the account managers graded at least one of their score as just 1 out of 5\n(very poor), whether it was their relationship with their broker, the quality of their\nrelationship with the customer or their understanding of customer\u2019s business and industry. It\nshould be emphasized that these 10 customers were the most important accounts for this\nbusiness unit, so to find minimum scores at all here was somewhat surprising. This finding\nindicates considerable disparities between account managers and suggests the possibility of\nthe transfer of best practice within the team, perhaps coupled with a need for training for\nsome of the key account managers. In addition to sharing best practice across the team, the\nsenior management may also choose to introduce customer-centered key performance\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n24\nindicators to measure the growth (or decline) of the key accounts being managed by the team.\nDavidson (2002) suggests five metrics to measure such levels of customer commitment:\n\uf0b7 What customers do:\n- share of market\n- share of customer spend in category\n- loyalty and levels of retention\n\uf0b7 What customers feel:\n- Customer satisfaction surveys\n- Levels of advocacy\nThe latter measure can readily be incorporated into the risk scorecard developed here (see the\nconclusions section).\nDiscussion about the longevity of customer relationships (factor 3) revealed that the KAMs\nhad asymmetric knowledge about their success or failure with customers. Where a customer\nwas lost, a \u2018post mortem\u2019 was held and there was good information about why the defection\nhad occurred. However, customers who renewed their contracts did not trigger this type of\nanalysis; consequently the key account managers didn\u2019t really know why they had been\nsuccessful in retaining some accounts. This finding led to a managerial action to improve the\nanalysis of success as well as failure and to disseminate that to the team.\n4.3 Developing probability-adjusted CLVs\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n25\nOnce the relationship risk scorecard had been agreed, it was then used to predict the\nprobability of future revenues based upon two insights:\n\uf0b7 Rather than adjusting the discount rate, a probability weighting should be applied to\nfuture revenues to reflect relationship risk; and\n\uf0b7 This probability could range from 40% to 90% on the basis that no account could be\nretained with 100% probability but neither should any key account have less than a\n40% probability of retention.\nBy working with the head of the KAM team and the Senior Actuary, probabilities were\nassigned to all values for each of the nine relationship risk factors. These probabilities were\nthen programmed into Excel. A simplified version of these probabilities for each risk factor is\npresented in Table 3.\n-Insert Table 3 about here-\nThe probability scaling was informed by the actual values in the account portfolio and it is\ninteresting to note that this scaling is non-linear. To test the scaling, further analysis and\nquestioning was carried out, factor by factor. For example, the probability scaling for factor 2\nsuggested that the retention impact of more than four lines was relatively slight. Analysis of\nthe customer portfolio revealed that the actual number of products held by each customer was\nas shown in Table 4.\n-Insert Table 4 about here-\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n26\nTwo customers held 3 business lines; seven had 4 each; two had 6 lines; and two had 10\nlines. Thus, the distribution of product holdings with most customers holding 4 lines or fewer\nexplains the probability scaling.\nSimilarly, further analysis was carried out on factors 6 and 7 (numbers of contacts). Across\nall the accounts there was more than one contact point since one-to-one relationships were\nregarded as risky by the KAM team. The assigned probability for factors 6 and 7 indicated\nthat more than 3 contacts were sufficient to give a very high probability of account renewal.\nThis probability was supported by further analysis which found that the mean number of\ncontacts at the customer was 3.8 with most key account managers having 3 contacts. The\nmean number of customer contacts at the company was 3.4, with most customers having 3 or\n4 contacts.\nA slightly different example was factor 3 where the scaling suggested that the duration of the\nrelationship beyond five years did not substantially increase the probability of retention.\nIntuitively, the assumption that long-lived customer relationships do not simply become any\nmore likely to endure just because they are long-lived seems appealing. This factor was\nidentified by the team as an issue that warrants further research.\nIn the final stage of our research work, these probabilities were applied to the potential future\nrevenues of all 10 key accounts and their probability-adjusted CLVs were calculated (column\n3 of Table 5 below). First, the overall risk probability of each customer was calculated as a\nstraight average of the probabilities of the individual relationship risk factors for that\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n27\ncustomer. This probability was then multiplied by the year-by-year forecast revenues to give\nprobability-adjusted revenues. Then, costs-to-serve3 and claims costs4 were deducted from\nthe probability-adjusted revenues. Finally, the probability-adjusted customer lifetime value\nwas calculated using WACC.\n-Insert Table 5 about here-\nA relatively high retention probability was to be expected for those customers whose\nrelationship was regarded as key to the company. The predicted probability of retention for\nthe 10 key accounts ranged from 68% to 82% with an average of 75%; probabilities that were\nconsidered to be high by the key account managers but which were validated by calculating\nthe average actual duration of key account relationships as just under 5 years.\nThe power of the probability-adjusted CLV was in the impact on the apparent value of the\ncustomer portfolio and on the impact on the organization\u2019s CRM strategies. The total value of\nthe account portfolio more than halved (Table 5, column 4). Two key accounts (C and J) went\nfrom positive to negative CLVs (column 3). From the key account managers\u2019 perspective, the\nimpact of changes in value of certain accounts and the sensitivity of the results to changes in\nprobabilities was perhaps more important than their absolute value. An immediate and\nimportant impact on CRM practices was to increase the account managers\u2019 focus on risk.\n3 The team has made a simplifying assumption that their costs- to-serve would be similar whether or not they won the client (effectively,\nthat they would spend as much time during the year trying to win back the client if they defected, as they would have done managing the\nclient if it had renewed).\n4 Claims costs (analogous to product costs) were bipolar (they were either incurred or not, depending on whether the client was won or lost)\nand temporally asymmetric (claims could occur in later years relating to revenues in earlier years). Because of these complex characteristics,\nit was decided to leave claims costs unadjusted, with the result that adjusting the probability of revenues exaggerated the difference from\ncustomer lifetime value.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n28\nThey looked at strategies that could both increase returns and reduce risk, such as cross-\nselling more products to customers buying fewer product lines (E, F, G, H and L). Numbers\nof contacts at the customer and at the company were also reviewed.\nThe results also serve to underline that certain key accounts which may be generating large\nrevenues for the company can have low year-on-year profitability and may easily become\nvalue-destroying if their risk increases. In this case, the firm\u2019s relationship with C and J, the\ntwo customers who had gone from positive to negative value once risk was taken into\naccount, were carefully scrutinized to explore whether these relationships were really worth\nthe level of expensive KAM resource they receive or whether they should be managed at\nlower service levels by a more generalist team. The process has helped the team to identify\nwhich of their accounts were truly key accounts and to adjust their service levels accordingly.\nAs a result of this analysis, key account managers of customers with lower retention\nprobabilities talked about spending more time on trying to acquire additional key accounts to\nreplace those most likely to defect. This was an interesting development since the KAM team\nhad previously focused primarily on existing customer relationships. Although the key\naccount managers were responsible for customer acquisition as well as retention, they found\nit difficult to manage the balance of these two activities and felt that the probability\nweightings indicated where and how they should spend their time. Thus, the relationship risk\nscorecard can have a role to play in marketing resource allocation in these kinds of\nrelationships, sitting alongside other portfolio management tools.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n29\nMoreover, the incorporation of risk into their thinking now influences which new customers\nthe team tries to acquire. In one case, the team made a decision not to bid for a huge\ninternational account despite being invited by the potential customer to do so; they calculated\nthat the potential lifetime value was too low to compensate for the risk.\n5. Conclusions and Limitations\nThis research addresses the challenges thrown out by Doyle (2000a), Rust et al. (2004b) and\nothers to examine the accountability of marketing and its contribution to shareholder value\ncreation. Conceptually, this research has taken a very different approach to the financial\nportfolio application of customer risk and returns suggested by Dhar and Glazer (2003)\nmentioned earlier. Whilst acknowledging that the notion of managing customers as a\nportfolio is an interesting and attractive one, we feel that financial portfolio approach has\nmany drawbacks. It is computationally complex and it relies for its measurement on betas\nwhich require a substantial number of data points (i.e. considerable historic data) and a\nsuitable market benchmark (Anderson 1981). More importantly, the hidden assumption in\napplying financial portfolio theory to customer portfolios is that a company\u2019s CRM activities\ndo not affect relationship risk with its customers.\nOur research based on this CRM perspective suggests that the actions that suppliers take to\nmanage their customer relationships do affect the risk of those relationships and that effective\nCRM practices can help reduce this customer risk. Moreover, the relevant risk for CRM is\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n30\nnot purely or even mainly the financial risk of default, but the relationship risk of the loss\n(total or partial) of the customer\u2019s business.\nIn this paper, we present a conceptual framework linking CRM to shareholder value through\nthe adjustment of CLV for relationship risk and propose a tool for measuring this risk; the\ncustomer relationship risk scorecard.\nAlthough the specific factors in the scorecard proposed here might not be directly\ngeneralizable, the principle and process of designing such a scorecard is. The process was to\nuse an elicitation technique as the basis for discussions with KAMs and senior managers\nabout customer relationship risk, and then applying probabilities to the results. There are also\nother theoretical and empirical limitations that need to be highlighted.\nThe theoretical limitations concern the unweighted nature of the scorecard presented here\nand the application of risk percentages. Both aspects need further testing. Empirically, this\nprocess could be used in other business-to-business markets, provided that the KAMs were\nable to make informed assessments of risk and it is operationally possible to collect the data\nrelating to each risk factor, particularly where the relationship with the customer extends\nacross more than one business unit. In a more data-rich environment than the current research\ncontext, it may be possible to derive the factors driving customer retention statistically and\nperhaps also to give them an importance weighing. Unlike Rust, Lemon and Zeithaml\n(2004a), we were not in a position to explore the \u2018outside-in\u2019 dimensions of customer equity\nand retention probabilities by questioning customers directly. Thus, the unweighted nature of\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n31\nthe relationship risk scorecard used here and the reliance on judgment-based, \u2018inside-out\u2019\ncustomer insights to estimate them is a limitation of this research.\nThere may also be practical limitations to the usefulness of the risk scorecard in less valuable\nrelationships or where default risk, rather than retention risk, is the main issue. In such\ncircumstances, traditional credit scoring may give a more useful picture of risk.\nThe results suggest that the tool is managerially useful and helps marketing with their CRM\nstrategy. For instance, some key account managers were tasked to improve their knowledge\nof the customer or the industry; others to increase the numbers of business lines sold or the\nnumber of contacts; still others to improve the quality of their relationships with the customer\nor the broker. The range of marketing actions stemming from this research suggests that the\nrisk scorecard may be useful in conjunction with other CRM tools such as market research\nand marketing portfolio management (Buttle 2004). For example, risk-adjusted customer\nlifetime value could be used as the measure of customer attractiveness in a Directional Policy\nMatrix (McDonald 1990), enabling the evaluation of both existing and potential customers in\nterms of their potential to create shareholder value.\nMore generally, there are some drawbacks to looking at customers purely in terms of lifetime\nvalue. Lifetime value is a forecast, which can be more - or less - accurate. The lifetime value\na company secures from its customers is affected by both acquisition and retention costs\n(Thomas, Reinartz and Kumar 2004). Thus, longer-lifetime customers are not necessarily\nmore profitable (East, Hammond and Gendall 2006). In other firms, where historic data on\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n32\nthe value of customers going back several years are available, \u2018backcasting\u2019 could be used to\ndetermine an optimal value for the customer portfolio. From this, marketing managers could\ndeduce what has to be done to retain the necessary amount of customers to reach the desired\npay-off.\nMoreover, customer behavior such as advocacy has been identified as an indirect source of\nvalue creation in that it may assist customer acquisition (East, Hammond and Gendall 2006;\nReichheld 2003). Although advocacy has not been considered in this research, it could\nreadily be included in the risk scorecard as a part-measure for both the KAM team and\nindividual KAMs. Such a metric has recently been successfully introduced by General\nElectric across its business units and Reichheld and Allen (2006) report that a significant\nportion of the GE managers\u2019 bonuses is now tied into achieving agreed levels of \u2018Net\nPromoter Scores\u2019. Other customer behaviors, such as sharing knowledge to access markets or\nengaging in the co-production of new services (Vargo and Lusch 2004), need to be factored\ninto CLV calculations in order to optimize shareholder value across the customer portfolio.\nAgain, these indirect sources of value could be incorporated into the scorecard as such shared\nactivities mitigate relationship risk; customers co-operating in aspects of market development\nare arguably less likely to migrate or defect. We acknowledge these limitations in our\nscorecard and, more generally, in our main research focus of calculating a customer\u2019s\neconomic value.\nWe have also demonstrated how one firm uses the relationship risk scorecard to assign\nspecific probabilities of customer retention and to adjust their CLV calculations. We\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n33\nrecognize that these probabilities were at least partially subjective, although we have shown\nthat further analysis provided a rationale for many of them. Longitudinal research over\nseveral years could test these probabilities against observed renewals and also explore\nwhether some factors were more important than others.\nAlthough the call for more accountable marketing is growing in intensity, the academic\nresponse to date has been limited, particularly in demonstrating how CRM activities link to\nthe creation of shareholder value. In fact, the whole area of the risk of customer relationships\nand how that risk can be managed is under-explored by marketing academics. We propose a\nconceptual framework to make that link, and we demonstrate a step-by-step\noperationalization that delivers useful insight into the profitable management of customer\nrelationships. However, much more needs to be done to improve our understanding of the\nrisk, as well as the returns, in customer relationships.\nIndustrial Marketing Management\n34\nReferences\nAmir, E., & Lev, B.
