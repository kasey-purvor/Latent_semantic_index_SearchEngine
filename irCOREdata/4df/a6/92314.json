Fluxes and concentrations of trace gases and particles were made from and above the rainforest canopy at the Bukit Atur Global Atmosphere Watch station and at the nearby Sabahmas oil palm plantation, using both ground-based and airborne measurements. Here, the measurement and modelling strategies used, the characteristics of the sites and an overview of data obtained are described. Composition measurements show that the rainforest site was not significantly impacted by anthropogenic pollution, and this is confirmed by satellite retrievals of NO2 and HCHO. The dominant modulators of atmospheric chemistry at the rainforest site were therefore emissions of BVOCs and soil emissions of reactive nitrogen oxides. At the observed BVOC:NOx volume mixing ratio (similar to 100 pptv\/pptv), current chemical models suggest that daytime maximum OH concentrations should be ca. 10(5) radicals cm(-3), but observed OH concentrations were an order of magnitude greater than this. We confirm, therefore, previous measurements that suggest that an unexplained source of OH must exist above tropical rainforest and we continue to interrogate the data to find explanations for this","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/92314.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/40010\/1\/acp%2D10%2D169%2D2010.pdf","pdfHashValue":"bfd044c3ed2498fa833ecb2d3d6c03ccc9f42832","publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lancs.ac.uk:40010<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2018-01-24T03:10:18Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      7374617475733D707562<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      7375626A656374733D47:4745<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D61727469636C65<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n    \n      \n        Overview: oxidant and particle photochemical processes above a south-east Asian tropical rainforest (the OP3 project):introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Hewitt, C.

Fluxes and concentrations of trace gases and particles were made from and above the rainforest canopy at the Bukit Atur Global Atmosphere Watch station and at the nearby Sabahmas oil palm plantation, using both ground-based and airborne measurements. Here, the measurement and modelling strategies used, the characteristics of the sites and an overview of data obtained are described. Composition measurements show that the rainforest site was not significantly impacted by anthropogenic pollution, and this is confirmed by satellite retrievals of NO2 and HCHO. The dominant modulators of atmospheric chemistry at the rainforest site were therefore emissions of BVOCs and soil emissions of reactive nitrogen oxides. At the observed BVOC:NOx volume mixing ratio (similar to 100 pptv\/pptv), current chemical models suggest that daytime maximum OH concentrations should be ca. 10(5) radicals cm(-3), but observed OH concentrations were an order of magnitude greater than this. We confirm, therefore, previous measurements that suggest that an unexplained source of OH must exist above tropical rainforest and we continue to interrogate the data to find explanations for this.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n        2010<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Journal Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lancs.ac.uk\/40010\/1\/acp%2D10%2D169%2D2010.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\n        http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5194\/acp-10-169-2010<\/dc:relation><dc:identifier>\n        Hewitt, C.

At the observed\nBVOC:NOx volume mixing ratio (\u223c100 pptv\/pptv), current\nchemical models suggest that daytime maximum OH con-\ncentrations should be ca. 105 radicals cm\u22123, but observed OH\nconcentrations were an order of magnitude greater than this.\nWe confirm, therefore, previous measurements that suggest\nthat an unexplained source of OH must exist above tropical\nrainforest and we continue to interrogate the data to find ex-\nplanations for this.\n1 Introduction\nTropical and equatorial forests account for over half of the\nWorld\u2019s forests (1.8 billion ha) and act as a massive source\nof matter and energy to the lower atmosphere. They exhibit\nsome of the most dynamic yet poorly understood biogeo-\nchemical behaviour on Earth. This behaviour is driven by\nsolar radiation and is largely mediated by its transformation\ninto latent and sensible heat, with the concomitant uptake of\ncarbon by photosynthesis and the associated emission of re-\nactive, less-reactive and un-reactive trace gases, water vapour\nand energy into the atmosphere. Simultaneously, ozone and\nother trace gases, aerosol particles, and momentum, are lost\nto the forest surface. A further important consequence of the\nlarge solar radiation flux in the tropics is the very vigorous\nconvective uplift that occurs, which results in the rapid move-\nment of chemical species emitted at or near ground level into\nthe free troposphere, as shown, for example, in Surinam (An-\ndreae et al., 2001). Hence reactive trace gas emissions from\nthe surface in the tropics may take part in chemical processes\nat greater distances and at higher altitudes from their sources\nthan might otherwise occur.\nGlobally, tropical and equatorial forests are estimated\nto account for almost half of all biogenic reactive volatile\norganic compound (VOC) emissions into the atmosphere\n(Guenther et al., 1995, 2006: global total 1150 Tg C\/y, es-\ntimate for tropical forests \u223c500 Tg C\/y). These compounds\nare believed to play a major role in mediating the chem-\nistry of the atmosphere, yet their roles in controlling chem-\nical budgets and processes in the atmosphere on the local,\nregional and global scales are poorly understood, with con-\nsiderable and surprising gaps and uncertainties in knowledge\nremaining (e.g. Lelieveld et al., 2008). In addition, it is pos-\nsible that biological primary and secondary organic particles\nplay a pivotal role in the formation of cloud condensation nu-\nclei (CNN) and thus control precipitation patterns in forested\nregions (Barth et al., 2005).\nMost previous work on the interactions between tropical\nforests and atmospheric composition has been carried out in\nAmazonia (e.g. the LBA project: Andreae et al., 2002; Avis-\nsar et al., 2002), with less in Africa (e.g. the AMMA project:\nRedelsperger et al., 2006) and very little in SE Asia. Un-\nlike the LBA and AMMA domains, which are contiguous\ncontinental regions, the complex mosaic of tropical seas and\nislands that exists in SE Asia makes the likely atmospheric\nchemistry occurring there somewhat different to that else-\nwhere. Structurally and floristically, the lowland dipterocarp\nforest of SE Asia is very different to the rainforest of Ama-\nzonia, and it is not known what differences this may cause in\nthe speciation and rates of emission of VOCs and hence in\natmospheric composition and chemistry. Furthermore, there\nis strong evidence that transport from the boundary layer in\nthis \u201cmaritime continent\u201d region into the upper troposphere,\nand possibly subsequently into the stratosphere, is particu-\nlarly efficient (Fueglistaler and Haynes, 2005), so that the\nregion\u2019s importance to global atmospheric processes may be\ndisproportionately large.\nIn common with the other tropical forest regions, SE Asia\nis undergoing very rapid, and in some cases catastrophic,\nrates of land use change. For example, in Malaysia, the area\nof total land cover dedicated to oil palm plantations has in-\ncreased from \u223c1% in 1974 to \u223c13% (FAO, 2005; MPOC,\n2008). In spite of attempts to implement policies to conserve\nrainforest, logging of this dwindling resource continues at\na rapid rate, and natural forests are being replaced by crop\nmonocultures.\nThe multi-national OP3 (\u201cOxidant and particle photo-\nchemical processes above a south-east Asian tropical rain-\nforest\u201d) project had the goal of better understanding the inter-\nactions that exist between natural forests, atmospheric com-\nposition and the Earth\u2019s climate system. The project had\nthe specific objectives of (a) understanding how emissions\nof reactive trace gases from a tropical rainforest mediate the\nregional scale production and processing of oxidants and\nparticles, and (b) better understanding the impacts of these\nprocesses on local, regional and global scale atmospheric\ncomposition, chemistry and climate. By very closely cou-\npling ground-based and airborne measurements of surface\nfluxes and atmospheric composition of reactive trace gases\nand particles with modelling studies of chemical processes,\nthe project aimed to address the following questions:\n1. What are the rates of transfer of organic compounds\nemitted from the tropical forest?\n2. How are these organic compounds chemically pro-\ncessed immediately after release?\n3. To what extent do the regional organic emissions con-\ntribute to the atmospheric aerosol in the region, and\nwhat are the effects of the aerosol? What is the com-\nposition of the organic fraction of the aerosol?\n4. What are the effects of these biogenic emissions on\nglobal chemistry and climate?\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 169\u2013199, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/\nC. N. Hewitt et al.: The OP3 project: introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools 171\nThe OH radical initiates the oxidative degradation of biogeni-\ncally emitted VOCs, and its concentration defines the rate of\nproduction of secondary products. A consistent and impor-\ntant finding from field studies conducted in forested environ-\nments, characterised by high emissions of isoprene and low\nlevels of NOx, is the significant underestimation of OH by\nmodels (Lelieveld et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2008; Butler et\nal., 2008; Carslaw et al., 2001; Martinez et al., 2008; Tan et\nal., 2001; Kubistin et al., 2009). These model underestima-\ntions scale with isoprene concentration and indicate a current\ninability to correctly describe isoprene oxidation. The OP3\nproject provided an excellent opportunity to confirm these\nfindings and to seek an explanation. Atmospheric chemistry\nmodels, constrained to measured isoprene emission rates,\npredict dramatic reductions in ambient OH concentrations in\nforested areas, in contrast to observations and, as a conse-\nquence, predict unrealistically high concentrations of other\ntrace gas constituents (Guenther et al., 2008). Simultane-\nous measurements of the OH concentration, isoprene con-\ncentration and fluxes and isoprene oxidation products were\nmade during OP3, together with many species that control\nthe rate of production and destruction of OH, providing a\nstringent set of model constraints to investigate in detail any\nmodelled\/measured discrepancies for OH.\nSimilarly, current models suggest that secondary organic\naerosol (SOA) in the tropics is dominated by biogenic aerosol\n(e.g. Kanakidou et al., 2005), but the measurement database\nis sparse. Emerging first measurements by aerosol mass\nspectrometry indicate that sub-micrometre organic aerosol\nconcentrations are at the lower end of the model estimates,\nwith median concentrations of around 1 \u00b5g m\u22123 observed in\nsubtropical West Africa and Amazonia (Capes et al., 2009).\nDespite recent progress, our picture of the formation pro-\ncesses of biogenic SOA (BSOA) is still far from complete\n(Hallquist et al., 2009). Again, the suite of measurements\nduring OP3 was designed to improve our understanding of\nthe levels, composition and formation processes of BSOA in\nthe SE Asian domain.\nAs described below, the focus of activity was the\nGlobal Atmosphere Watch (GAW) station at Bukit Atur,\nSabah, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo (4\u25e658\u203249.33\u2032\u2032 N,\n117\u25e650\u203239.05\u2032\u2032 E, 426 m a.s.l.) (http:\/\/gaw.empa.ch\/gawsis\/).\nTwo field campaigns were held during the periods 7 April\u20134\nMay 2008 (OP3-I) and 23 June\u201323 July 2008 (OP3-III). Dur-\ning OP3-III, the UK\u2019s largest atmospheric science research\naircraft, a converted BAe 146\u2013301, was based at Kota Kina-\nbalu International Airport during the period 8\u201323 July 2008\nand operated for over 60 h over northern Borneo. Between\nthese two forest campaigns, a sub-set of instruments were de-\nployed in an oil palm plantation, where measurements were\nmade during the period 11 May\u201320 June 2008 (OP3-II).\nIn this paper, the land use, vegetation and climate char-\nacteristics of the ground-based measurement sites are de-\nscribed, together with an overview of the chemical clima-\ntology of the region. The measurement and modelling tools\nused in the project are also described, as are some prelimi-\nnary conclusions.\n2 Climate, weather, land use and vegetation of Sabah\n2.1 Equatorial climate and forest formations\nThe equatorial tropics are characterised by rain throughout\nthe year, i.e., an absence of marked seasonal droughts. This\nclimatic regime covers: (i) Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and\nmuch of Indonesia within tropical monsoon Asia, (ii) coastal\nregions of Liberia, Nigeria and Cameroon, and central Congo\nin Africa, and (iii) western Amazonia and a belt extend-\ning from the western Caribbean coast to the Pacific coast in\nEcuador in tropical America (McGregor and Nieuwolt, 1998;\nWalsh, 1996). The equatorial tropics can be further clas-\nsified into tropical superwet, tropical wet and tropical wet\nseasonal, using a perhumidity index, based on a cumulative\nannual score of the number of months with >200 mm (+2 in-\ndex value), 100\u2013199 mm (+1), 50\u201399 mm (\u22121) and <50 mm\n(\u22122) of rainfall (Walsh, 1996). The extent of tropical super-\nwet and wet climates (with a perhumidity index >10) shown\nin Walsh (1996) is similar to the extent of tropical climates\nof Asia and America lacking marked dry seasons shown in\nMcGregor and Nieuwolt (1998).\nWith the exception of the central Congo and the western\nCaribbean, there is a good correspondence of regions with\na tropical wet or superwet climate and the extent of tropi-\ncal lowland evergreen broadleaf rainforest. This forest for-\nmation dominates within the majority of the Asian, West\nAfrican and American wet\/superwet zone of the equatorial\ntropics (Whitmore, 1998), and is the most common forest\nformation in the tropics as a whole (Schmitt et al., 2008).\nHowever, in areas locally above 750\u20131200 m altitude, low-\nland evergreen broadleaf rainforest grades into lower mon-\ntane and then upper montane forest. Such areas of mountain\nforests are noted particularly in the wet\/superwet zones of the\nAsian tropics. Within low-lying areas of the wet and super-\nwet zone, peat swamp, freshwater swamp and heath forest\nare also present. In areas of podzolic sands, limestone or ul-\ntrabasic rocks other forest formations are developed locally.\nThe key exception to the link between climate and the\nextent of lowland evergreen rainforest is found within cen-\ntral Congo and the western Caribbean, where tropical semi-\nevergreen rainforest dominates in areas classified as tropi-\ncal wet. This semi-evergreen forest formation is important\nthroughout the surrounding seasonal tropics of continental\ntropical Asia, north-east Australia, and eastern and southern\nAmazonia (Whitmore, 1998).\nWithin the equatorial tropics, the dominant lowland ever-\ngreen broadleaf rainforest is characterised by a lofty (45 m\nor taller) and dense canopy with a large number of differ-\nent tree species occurring together. Usually over two thirds\nof the upper canopy comprises tree species not contributing\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 169\u2013199, 2010\n172 C. N. Hewitt et al.: The OP3 project: introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools\nmore than 1% to the total number (Whitmore, 1998). The\nsoils typically associated with the occurrence of this forest\nformation in tropical Asia are the Ultisol group, and within\nwestern Amazonia the Oxisol group (Baillie, 1996; Chappell\net al., 2007).\n2.2 Local climate and forest formations\nThe majority of the island of Borneo (total area 743 330 km2)\nhas a superwet climate (Walsh, 1996) and the most extensive\nforest formation is lowland evergreen broadleaf rainforest,\noccupying some 257 000 km2 (Schmitt et al., 2008). A sim-\nilar situation is observed at the 76 115 km2 regional scale of\nthe state of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Within Borneo Island,\nand elsewhere within equatorial Asia, the lowland evergreen\nrainforest typically has a tree family dominance of Diptero-\ncarpaceae (Whitmore, 1984). Most of the state of Sabah was\nonce covered with rainforest (Schmitt et al., 2008), particu-\nlarly such mixed dipterocarp forest. Currently, some 47%\n(36 049 km2) of the state lies within Permanent Forest Estate\n(PFE: Fig. 1a). Most of this PFE (74%) is maintained un-\nder a selective harvesting system (PFE Production Forest),\nwhile the remaining 26% is classified as PFE Protection For-\nest. Within eastern Sabah, most of the cleared lands are now\nused for the cultivation of oil palm trees (Fig. 1b). Some\ncommercial timber plantations are also present within Sabah.\nThe Bukit Atur GAW tower used for OP3 sampling is lo-\ncated within the PFE Production Forest of the Ulu Segama\n\u2013 Malua Forest Reserve, but is less than 5 km east of\nthe 438 km2 area of PFE Protection Forest known as the\nDanum Valley Conservation Area (DVCA). The Ulu Segama\n\u2013 Malua Forest Reserve is 2411 km2 in area and is divided\ninto annual timber harvesting coupes. The GAW tower lies\nat the centre of the 22.6 km2 \u201cCoupe 88\u201d which was sub-\njected to selective timber harvesting in 1988. An average of\n96 m3 of timber ha\u22121 was cut by both tractor and high-lead\nharvesting (Tangki and Chappell, 2008). The central area\nof this coupe was subsequently rehabilitated by enrichment\nplanting (Moura-Costa, 1996). As part of a study covering a\n225 km2 area Tangki and Chappell (2008) calculated an av-\nerage tree biomass of 172 t ha\u22121 for Coupe 88, (using five\ninventory plots surveyed in March 1997), and demonstrated\na strong correlation (r2=0.76) between such coupe-averaged\nvalues and Landsat-5 TM band 4 (near-infra red) radiance.\nTangki (2008) demonstrated that Dipterocarpaceae were the\nmost abundant tree family recorded for the 225 km2 area as\na whole (comprising of only lowland evergreen broadleaf\nrainforest), but Euphobiaceae had become more abundant in\nCoupe 88 following timber harvesting.\nWithin the immediate vicinity of the Bukit Atur GAW\ntower, we calculate the average perhumidity index to be 22\n(using the daily rainfall data for the period 1996\u20132008 from\nthe Danum Valley Field Centre (DVFC), located 8 km from\nBukit Atur at 4\u25e658\u2032 N, 117\u25e648\u2032\u2032 E, 100 m a.s.l.). Hence Bukit\nAtur is classified as having a superwet climate. The index\n 44 \n \nFigure 1.

During the\nOP3 campaign year of 2008, the perhumidity index was 22,\nand therefore identical to the longer-term average.\nThe 23-year mean rainfall (1986\u20132008 inclusive) for the\nDVFC rain gauge is 2840 mm (\u00b1438 mm standard devia-\ntion). The wettest month is typically January with 310 mm\nprecipitation. April is typically the driest month with\n155 mm on average, but it also has the most variable rain-\nfall total with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 69% against\nAtmos. Chem.

Hewitt et al.: The OP3 project: introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools 173\na mean monthly CV of 46%. Indeed, the three-month pe-\nriod from February to April has the least predictable rainfall\ntotals, with CV values all over 57%. This variability in rain-\nfall totals may relate to the period being at the change from\nthe northeast monsoon (approximately November\u2013April) to\nthe southwest monsoon (approximately May\u2013October: Bidin\nand Chappell, 2006).\nRainfall in 2008 totalled 3220 mm, the fifth wettest year in\nthe 23-year record with 113% of normal rainfall. The mag-\nnitude of the seasonal variations in rainfall was the smallest\non record with a CV of 23%, against the long-term average\nmonthly CV of 47%. This lack of marked seasonality was\nalso shown in the number of days with rainfall. A total of\n257 rain-days, the largest number in the 23-year record, were\nobserved in 2008 against an average of 226 rain-days.\n2.3 Campaign meteorology\nMost of the OP3 measurements were undertaken within the\nfour-month period of April to July 2008. This period was\n124% more wet than normal, with 1045 mm of rainfall. No-\ntably, the driest month according to the longer-term record,\nApril, received 170% of the normal rainfall at 263 mm. The\nApril\u2013July 2008 period was also cooler, with a mean temper-\nature of 27.1 \u25e6C, which was 99% of the norm for April\u2013July\n2001\u20132008.\nA clear diurnal cycle in the rainfall is observed, even\nwithin the records of the relatively short OP3 campaign pe-\nriod of April\u2013July (Fig. 2a). The presence of a late afternoon\npeak in rainfall at DVFC, which is more pronounced when\nseveral years of data are summarised, as in Bidin and Chap-\npell (2006), results from the diurnal development of convec-\ntive rainfall cells, which is consistent with LIDAR observa-\ntions (peak rainfall typically observed around 15:00 LT) and\nmeasurements of radiation and heat fluxes at the site (Pear-\nson et al., 2010; Helfter et al., 2010). The predominance of\nrainfall delivery by convective events also results in an ex-\ntreme localisation of the rainfall field. Within a 5 km2 region\nencompassing the summit of Bukit Atur, Bidin and Chap-\npell (2003) demonstrated that inter-gauge correlation in an-\nnual rainfall totals fell to 0.90 over distances of only 1.1 km,\nwhich is short even by comparison with other convective sys-\ntems.\nFigure 2 also shows median temperatures at various\nheights at Bukit Atur for the combined periods of OP3-I and\nOP3-III, measured with aspirated thermocouples. The over-\nall median temperature at 30 m was 25.1\u00b11.6 \u25e6C. This is sim-\nilar to the long-term surface temperature data from DVFC,\ntaking into account a typical temperature gradient with alti-\ntude. During the campaign, the atmospheric stability varied\nfrom strongly stable at night to strongly unstable during the\nmiddle of the day, as would be expected for a convective re-\ngion with low wind speeds.\nWhen the boundary layer was stable, the rainforest canopy\nwas decoupled from the overlying atmosphere, resulting\n 45 \nFigure 2.

There is a tail of dull days (shown by the 5th\npercentile) but, on the whole, the period of the campaign\nwas bright. The warm temperatures and bright sunshine\nproduced substantial emissions of biogenic volatile organic\ncompounds (BVOCs) from the forest (Sect. 4.2.2, below).\nTurning from vertical mixing\/convective effects, to take\na more horizontal\/advective view, backwards air mass tra-\njectories were analysed in order to characterise the origins\nof chemical species measured at Bukit Atur during the mea-\nsurement campaigns. They were calculated by the British At-\nmospheric Data Centre (BADC) Web Trajectory Service us-\ning European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n(ECMWF) wind fields. A series of trajectories was calcu-\nlated, with one trajectory for every hour during OP3-I and\nOP3-III. These were then analysed to give an ensemble rep-\nresentation of air mass residency time as a function of loca-\ntion for the whole of each campaign (Ashbaugh et al., 1985).\nBack trajectories are calculated for the 24 h before arrival\nat Bukit Atur, with a time resolution of 30 min, and a final\npressure altitude of 950 hPa. Back trajectories that touch the\nground have been removed. Figure 3a and b show air mass\nresidency time on a 0.1\u25e6\u00d70.1\u25e6 grid for all back trajectories\nfrom the first and third campaign periods, respectively.\nThe first campaign period (OP3-I) was influenced by air\nmasses from most directions, in contrast to OP3-III when the\nair was predominantly from the south. The southern air in\nthe third period can be split into two main areas of origin:\nthe SE air from the sea with a minimal fetch over land, and\nthe SW air which is exclusively over land. This can be used\nto identify and compare periods of marine and terrain influ-\nenced air. It is possible to extend this analysis by using only\ntrajectories from periods when a certain measurement is ele-\nvated, giving a coloured probability distribution of the source\nof the measured quantity. A subsequent paper will use these\ntechniques to present a more in-depth analysis of chemical\norigins in the future.\n2.4 Land-cover classification and VOC emissions\nmodelling\nBiogenic VOC emissions are highly sensitive to land-cover\ncharacteristics and can vary over several orders of magni-\ntude across different landscapes. This is partly due to vari-\nability in total biomass density but is greatly enhanced by\nvariability among different plant species, especially for com-\npounds such as isoprene that are emitted by less than a third\nof all plant species. This presents a daunting challenge for at-\n 47 \nFigure 3. Air mass residency times for air reaching Bukit Atur (black circle) during \n(top panel) OP3-I and (bottom panel) OP3-III.

(1995) estimated global biogenic VOC\nemissions using the highest resolution (0.5\u25e6) and most de-\ntailed global map of land-cover and land-use (Olson, 1992)\navailable at that time. Figure 4 (top left panel) illustrates\nthe Olson (1992) classification of Borneo landscapes, which\ninclude six unmanaged land-cover types, dominated by trop-\nical rainforest (50%), marsh\/swamp (14%) and tropical mon-\ntane (7%) and three managed land-cover types dominated by\nre-growing woods (9%) and paddy rice (7%). The associ-\nated isoprene emission factor map shown in Fig. 4 (top right\npanel) characterizes the gross features of Borneo but does not\nrepresent the full diversity of landscapes in this region. A\nmajor limitation of the Olson global ecosystem approach is\nthat, for example, all re-growing woods are lumped together\nand observations from North American and European forests\nAtmos. Chem.

The\nGuenther et al. (1995) estimate of annual isoprene emission\nfrom Borneo is about 10 Tg of carbon, which is 2% of the\nestimated global total.\nThe availability of satellite observations has greatly im-\nproved quantitative estimates of eco-region distributions and\nother land-cover variables, including leaf area indices (LAI)\nand plant functional type (PFT) cover fractions. In addi-\ntion, the development of a global geo-referenced eco-region\nmap by Olson et al. (2001) represents an additional major\nadvance for biogenic emission modeling. This high reso-\nlution digital map is the product of over 1000 biogeogra-\nphers, taxonomists, conservation biologists and ecologists\nfrom around the world. Each of the 867 eco-regions rep-\nresented on this map has relatively uniform species com-\nposition and is accompanied by an online database (http:\n\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/wildworld\/) that includes a\ndescription of the dominant plant species. Figure 4 (lower\nleft) shows that this database divides Borneo into seven eco-\nregions with Borneo lowland rainforests covering just over\nhalf of the total land area, Borneo montane rainforests and\nSundaland heath forests together comprise about 25%, and\nthe remaining four ecoregions (Kinabalu montane alpine\nmeadows, Borneo peat swamp forests, Borneo freshwater\nswamp forests, Sunda Shelf mangroves) each make up 1 to\n8% of the total. While the total area associated with broad\ntypes (e.g. tropical forest, montane forest) agree reasonably\nwell with the Olson (1992) database, the details differ con-\nsiderably. Figure 4 (bottom right) shows that land-cover re-\nsults in considerable differences between the isoprene emis-\nsion factor distribution of Guenther et al. (1995) and the\nMEGAN model (Guenther et al., 2006) which uses the Ol-\nson et al. (2001) eco-region map and satellite derived PFT\n(e.g. crop, broadleaf tree, shrub) cover fractions. In addition,\nMEGAN uses plant species composition estimates from the\nOlson et al. (2001) global terrestrial eco-region database and\nthe Leff et al. (2004) crop species distribution database. Al-\nthough the spatial pattern is quite different, the annual iso-\nprene emission for Borneo differs by less than 5% when the\nMEGAN land-cover is used in place of Guenther et al. (1995)\nland-cover data. This good agreement, however, is the result\nof major offsetting differences between these two land-cover\ndatabases. The Guenther et al. (1995) foliar density and LAI\nestimates are about 50% higher, resulting in about 25% more\nisoprene, but the emission factors are about 25% lower. The\nresult is a very similar annual isoprene emission but for dif-\nferent reasons.\nThe MEGAN framework can be used to estimate re-\ngional to global biogenic VOC emissions but the accuracy of\nthe results is dependent on the availability of representative\nmeasurements of individual ecoregions. A lack of BVOC\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 169\u2013199, 2010\n176 C. N. Hewitt et al.: The OP3 project: introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools\nmeasurements from Borneo resulted in the assignment of\nMEGAN version 2.1 emission factors to the ecoregions of\nBorneo that were based on observations from other tropical\nregions. Improved estimates for future versions of MEGAN\nand other models are highly dependent on the availability\nof observations characterizing the dominant plant functional\ntypes within major global ecoregions. In fact, our initial anal-\nysis of emissions from Bukit Atur show that the default base\nemission rates in MEGAN prior to the OP3 observations are\na factor of four too high for this forest ecoregion. We also\nconfirm that, unusually for a species classified as crop in\nMEGAN, oil palm is an intense isoprene emitter.\n3 Measurement strategy and methods\nThe overall measurement strategy for OP3 was to perform\nintegrated measurements from the forest-floor, through the\nforest canopy, above the canopy and then up-scaled to the\nregional scale using airborne measurements, with clear link-\nages between measurements made at the different sites at the\ndifferent scales.\n3.1 Ground based measurements\nGround based measurements were centred on the 100 m\ntower at the Bukit Atur GAW station (4\u25e658\u203249.33\u2032\u2032 N,\n117\u25e650\u203239.05\u2032\u2032 E, 426 m a.s.l.) (http:\/\/gaw.empa.ch\/gawsis\/).\nAn \u201cin-canopy\u201d sampling site was established 2 km E of the\nBukit Atur tower (4\u25e658\u203249.10\u2032\u2032 N, 117\u25e651\u203219.12\u2032\u2032 E) and a\nfurther \u201coil palm plantation\u201d sampling site was established\nat the Sabahmas oil palm estate, 70 km NE of Bukit Atur\n(5\u25e614\u203258.69\u2032\u2032 N, 118\u25e627\u203215.76\u2032\u2032 E).\n3.1.1 Forest floor (soil) NOx flux measurements\nThe fluxes of NOx from forest soil were measured using a\ncontinuous automated dynamic chamber system at the \u201cin-\ncanopy site\u201d. Seven spatially distributed chambers were used\nin order to represent the spatial variation inherent in soil NOx\nemissions at each site. The chamber construction and oper-\nation is described in Pilegaard (2001) while the flux calcula-\ntion method was modified from Conrad (1994), with further\ndetails available in Dorsey and Gallagher (2010). In addition,\nfluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were made\nat the \u201cin-canopy site\u201d, at a near-by undisturbed primary for-\nest site, at a heavily disturbed road-side site and from the\nsoils at the oil palm plantation (see below), using static soil\nchambers (Siong et al., 2009; Ryder et al., 2010).\n3.1.2 Within-canopy concentration profiles\nAt the \u201cin-canopy site\u201d, measurements were made of the\nvertical gradients (from the ground to 32 m height) of the\nconcentrations of ozone, NOx, volatile organic compounds,\nparticle size distribution and composition, as well as tem-\nperature, relative humidity, radiation and turbulence. Four\nplatforms were strapped against an emergent tree (Canarium\ndecumanum), at 8, 16, 24, 32 m. Each platform sup-\nported sonic anemometers, inlets to a gradient system for\nO3\/NO\/NO2 and fine thermocouples. In addition, an auto-\nmated winch system continuously raised and lowered a tem-\nperature\/humidity probe, a PAR sensor, an optical particle\nspectrometer (GRIMM 1.08) and an inlet leading to a PTR-\nMS. This gave vertical gradient measurements between 2 and\n28 m (Ryder et al., 2010). In a clearing near the in-canopy\nsite, LIDAR measurements were made of wind speed and di-\nrection and of aerosol backscatter throughout the boundary\nlayer.\n3.1.3 Concentration and flux measurements at Bukit\nAtur\nThe largest number of ground-based measurements were\nmade at the Bukit Atur GAW station, which routinely records\nCO2 and O3 mixing ratios, and various aerosol parame-\nters. The station consists of a main building with four air-\nconditioned laboratories at the base of a 100 m tower, all lo-\ncated in a large (\u223c150\u00d750 m) clearing on the top of a hill\nand surrounded by forest. The surrounding forest canopy ex-\ntends \u223c10 m above the base of the tower. Four mobile sea-\ncontainer laboratories were deployed around the base of the\ntower to provide extra instrument accommodation. Electri-\ncal power was provided by generators, located 2 km E of the\nstation. Pollution events, attributable to individual vehicles\narriving on site, the generators, or to small leaks of reactive\ncompounds on site, were identified by elevated concentra-\ntions of the oxides of nitrogen and by wind direction analy-\nsis, and are excluded from subsequent data analysis.

The trees were of uniform age (12 years)\nand height (12 m). The site comprised a 15 m tower and an\n8 m canopy access platform. Instruments were housed in a\nhut at the base of the platform. The analytical methods used\nwere the same as at Bukit Atur, including the measurements\nof aerosol sub-micrometre composition, fluxes of aerosol,\nBVOCs, ozone and CO2, although the suite of measurements\nmade was not as comprehensive. In particular, measurements\nof OH and other radicals and of the oxides of nitrogen were\nnot made.\n3.1.5 Airborne measurements\nAirborne measurements (see Table 1) were made dur-\ning OP3-III using the Natural Environment Research\nCouncil\/UK Meteorological Office\u2019s BAe 146\u2013301 Facility\nfor Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) aircraft\n(Lewis et al., 2007), deployed to Kota Kinabalu airport, less\nthan 30 min flying time from Bukit Atur. In general, the same\ntype of flight plan was executed on each flight, with one pro-\nfile up and one down, interrupted by straight and level runs at\naltitudes of 100\u2013250, 1500, 3000 and 6000 m above ground\nover the rainforest (centred on Bukit Atur), over an exten-\nsive and homogeneous agro-industrial oil palm landscape\nsurrounding and including the Sabahmas oil palm plantation\nestate, and in transects between the two sites. Flights were\nmade morning and afternoon giving typically four stacked\nprofiles, allowing a picture to be built up of the concentra-\ntions of trace gases and particles during the daytime. Two\nflights were also made over the ocean up- and down-wind of\nSabah.\nIn order to link the ground-based and airborne measure-\nments, the aircraft flew past the Bukit Atur measurement sta-\ntion on more than ten occasions, at the same height above\nsea-level as the base of the GAW tower and at approximately\n500 m horizontal separation. Table 2 summarises the flights\nmade during the OP3 deployment and Fig. 5 shows the geo-\ngraphical extent of the flights over Sabah.\n4 The chemical climatology of Sabah and Bukit Atur\n4.1 Satellite observations\nSatellite observations of key tropospheric trace gases allow\nthe surface and aircraft trace gas measurements above the\nrainforest surrounding Bukit Atur to be put in a wider context\nrelative to Borneo and the larger south-east Asian region. We\nfocus on formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2),\nwhich are good indicators of emissions and photochemical\nactivity, to examine the atmospheric chemistry over Borneo\nduring the OP3 campaigns in 2008. Global background con-\ncentrations of HCHO are determined by the balance between\nthe source (from the oxidation of methane) and the OH sink.\nConcentrations are typically much larger over continents due\nto additional sources from the oxidation of biogenic and an-\nthropogenic VOCs, and from biomass burning (either di-\nrectly released or from the oxidation of co-emitted VOCs)\n(Palmer et al., 2003; Fu et al., 2007).

In contrast, we average\nthe HCHO columns onto a coarser 2.5\u25e6\u00d72.0\u25e6 grid (to im-\nprove the signal-to-noise ratio), since it is a much weaker\nabsorber and because global coverage is only achieved by\nSCIAMACHY at the Equator every 6 days. Scenes with frac-\ntional cloud coverage >40% are excluded from our analysis.\nFigure 6b shows that NO2 measurements from OMI iden-\ntify anthropogenic NOx signals from Bangkok, Jakarta,\nSurabaya and Singapore. Enhanced HCHO also seen over\nthese cities indicates intense photochemical activity, likely\nassociated with polluted conditions.

However, dur-\ning the OP3 campaigns, fire activity over Malaysian Borneo\nwas minimal and the levels of HCHO and NO2 were gen-\nerally low, with their column amounts typically approach-\ning their background values of \u223c5\u00d71015 molecules cm\u22122\nand \u223c5\u00d71014 molecules cm\u22122, respectively. These low val-\nues also suggest that during the OP3 measurement period\nthe HCHO source from biogenic VOC oxidation was weak.\nWe observe a slight HCHO enhancement during April over\nDanum Valley (Fig. 6a), but it is difficult to assign source\nattribution.\nIn Fig. 6c we show the monthly-mean 12-year time series\nof (continuous) HCHO and (non-continuous) NO2 columns,\nretrieved from the GOME and SCIAMACHY instruments\n(De Smedt et al., 2008; Martin et al., 2002, 2003), to-\ngether with the total number of fire-counts detected by the\nATSR\/AATSR instruments (Arino et al., 2001, 2005). High\ncorrelations between HCHO and NO2 columns and the fire-\ncount data suggest that biomass burning over Borneo drives\nobserved variability of these trace gases. We find that anoma-\nlously high HCHO and NO2 columns were due to intense\nburning periods associated with strong El Nino conditions,\nindicated here by the Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscilla-\ntion (ENSO) Index (Wolter and Timlin, 1998), as expected.\nFor example, during 1997\/98 an increased number of forest\nand peat fires during the warmer and drier El Nino condi-\ntions (Levine, 1999) led to extremely high trace gas column\nconcentrations.\nOur recent analysis shows that spatial correlations be-\ntween the 12-year HCHO and NO2 data, and the associated\nassimilated meteorological data, vegetation activity and fire-\ncounts were strongest in southernmost Borneo and not over\nthe Bukit Atur (Danum Valley) region (Barkley et al., 2009).\nThe low trace gas columns observed over this region during\n2008 are consistent with our understanding of past variabil-\nity.\nAtmos.

Figure 7 shows aircraft measurements of six species\ntaken on flights near to the Bukit Atur GAW station and the\nadjacent oil palm plantations. Data are shown from flights\n(a) below 500 m above ground level, representative of the\nboundary layer and (b) above 2500 m, representative of the\nfree troposphere. Also indicated on the plots is the approx-\nimate boundary between the natural rainforest and the palm\noil plantations.\nWithin the boundary layer (Fig. 7a), the most striking\nconcentration difference between the rainforest and plan-\ntation is for isoprene. Concentrations over the rainfor-\nest were typically 1000\u20133000 pptv, with concentrations over\nthe plantation significantly higher (2\u20135 times higher; 5000\u2013\n10 000 pptv). This is consistent with the higher emission rate\nof isoprene from oil palm trees (Elaeis guineensis) compared\nto most rainforest tree species (Wilkinson et al., 2006). The\nplantation landscape also contains associated agro-industrial\nactivities (e.g. road traffic, oil palm processing plants and ni-\ntrogenous fertiliser application) and as a result, NOx concen-\ntrations were also higher compared to the rainforest. How-\never, whereas the higher isoprene concentrations observed\ntended to be in the west of the oil palm plantation area,\nhigher NOx levels were concentrated in the north and east\nof the plantation area, where the majority of plantation pro-\ncessing plants were observed to be situated. In this area, typ-\nical NOx levels were 1000\u20131500 pptv, with up to >2000 pptv\nobserved when flying through or close to the plume of a pro-\ncessing plant. Further south in the plantation area, closer to\nthe boundary with the rainforest, NOx was much lower, with\nlevels typically <300 pptv, which is similar to levels that are\nobserved over the rainforest.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/ Atmos.

Levels of sulphate aerosol show little differ-\nence between the two land use areas, with both exhibiting\naerosol loading of 0.25\u20131 \u00b5g m\u22123.\nThe result of the increased levels of primary pollutants\nover the oil palm plantation compared to the rainforest can\nbe seen in the observed ozone, a species that is not directly\nemitted into the atmosphere but produced photochemically.\nOzone was significantly higher (20\u201325 ppbv) over the eastern\narea of oil palm plantation, corresponding to the area where\nNOx was generally higher. Over the western area of oil palm\nplantation, where NOx levels are lower but isoprene levels\nare still high, and over the natural rainforest, where both NOx\nand isoprene are lower, ozone is observed to be 8\u201315 ppbv.\nThis demonstrates the need for increased NOx emissions, as\nwell as isoprene, in order for significant extra ozone produc-\ntion to occur (Hewitt et al., 2009). More organic particulate\nwas observed over the oil palm plantation than the rainfor-\nest, with average loadings of 0.67 \u00b5g m\u22123 and 0.48 \u00b5g m\u22123\nrespectively, which is consistent with our ground based mea-\nsurements (see below) and could be due to enhanced produc-\ntion of secondary organic material, although primary emis-\nsions from the processing plants and human settlements may\nalso be contributing.\n 52 \nFigure 7b.

Flight track of all data collected from the aircraft above\n2500 m (in the free troposphere), coloured by NOx, isoprene, ozone\nand organic\/sulphate aerosol content.\nIn the free troposphere (Fig. 7b), very little isoprene or sul-\nphate aerosol was observed over either the rainforest or plan-\ntation and levels of CO were similar over both areas (\u223c50\u2013\n60 ppbv). NOx levels were higher in the eastern plantation re-\ngion (200\u2013300 pptv) compared to the rainforest (<50 pptv);\nhowever this did not lead to increased ozone in the free tro-\nposphere over the plantation. This is likely to be due to the\nvery low levels of isoprene and other biogenic VOCs, which\ndo not have a long enough lifetime to escape the boundary\nlayer. Organic aerosol was also very low over both planta-\ntion and rainforest in the free troposphere, with an average\norganic loading of 0.03 \u00b5g m\u22123.\nAs described above, some flights were also undertaken\nover the ocean, both upwind and downwind of Sabah. Levels\nof isoprene and NOx were very low in both cases and there\nwas no obvious enhancement in ozone in the upwind flights.\nThese data were collected on only two days; however our ini-\ntial interpretation of this is that Sabah is not a large exporter\nof primary or processed pollutants to the wider region.\n4.2.2 Bukit Atur measurements\nData were taken within the rainforest at the Bukit Atur GAW\nstation during two four-week intensive measurement periods\n(OP3-I and OP3-III). The GAW station has made ozone mea-\nsurements since January 2007 and these data are shown in\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 169\u2013199, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/\nC. N.

However the plot shows that the\nlevels of ozone observed during the OP3 intensive periods in\n2008 are typical for the site.\nCampaign daytime (10:00\u201314:00) average isoprene and\ntotal monoterpene fluxes measured at 75 m on the GAW\ntower were 1.2 and 0.3 mg m\u22122 h\u22121 respectively during OP3-\nI and 2.1 and 0.49 mg m\u22122 h\u22121 during OP3-III (Langford et\nal., 2010). These values were comparable to measurements\nmade above regions of the Congo during the EXPRESSO\nfield campaigns (Greenberg et al., 1999; Klinger et al., 1998;\nSerca et al., 2001) and are somewhat smaller than values re-\nported above regions of the Amazon (Karl et al., 2007; Kuhn\net al., 2007). The typical monoterpene to isoprene ratio was\nbetween 0.2\u20130.25, which is within the upper range of ratios\nreported in other tropical regions (Guenther et al., 2008). The\nfluxes of other biogenic VOCs, including methanol, acetone\nand acetaldehyde, were very much smaller, accounting for\njust 2% of the total measured VOC emissions.\nFigure 9a shows hourly averaged median diurnal cycles\nfor NO, NO2, O3, isoprene and sulphate and organic aerosol\nmass concentration, taken at Bukit Atur during June and July\n2008. Only data from the six days when flights took place\nover the station were used in the averaging for a direct com-\nparison between the ground-based and aircraft data in the\nboundary layer and free troposphere over the rainforest. Note\nthat since Bukit Atur is on a ridge, some of the boundary\nlayer data collected by the aircraft over the surrounding for-\nest were at the same or lower altitude (above sea level) as the\nGAW tower.\nFor NO, a peak of \u223c100 pptv was observed between 07:00\nand 08:00 local time, which corresponds to the onset of\nNO2 photolysis. This was followed by a drop to \u223c40 pptv\nby 11:00, with NO then remaining fairly constant through-\nout the day, until a further drop to \u223c20 pptv occurred at\naround 17:00. NO then remained constant throughout the\n 54 \nFigure 9a.

NO2 exhibits a clear diurnal cycle peaking at around\nmidnight at 300 pptv, with a minimum of \u223c150 pptv in\nmid-afternoon. These values are comparable to NOx mea-\nsurements made in Amazonia (e.g. Ganzeveld et al., 2008)\nand over West Africa during the AMMA experiments (e.g.\nSaunois et al., 2009).\nBoundary layer aircraft measurements of NO and NO2\nwere in reasonable agreement with the ground based mea-\nsurements, although airborne NO levels were consistently\nlower. This, along with the non-zero night-time levels, sug-\ngests a local NO source that was diluted throughout the\nboundary layer. NO and NO2 levels in the free troposphere\nwere much lower, being <10 pptv and \u223c20 pptv, respec-\ntively. A full description of ground level NOx data and dis-\ncussion of the chemistry is given by Pike et al. (2009) and\nPugh et al. (2010b).\nIsoprene was the most abundant terpenoid compound ob-\nserved and showed a clear diurnal cycle with very low\n(<40 pptv) levels at night and a peak of \u223c2000 pptv in mid\nafternoon. This was caused by the dependence of isoprene\nemission from trees on temperature and light (Guenther et\nal., 1993). Boundary layer isoprene measurements from\nthe aircraft were in good agreement with the ground-based\nBukit Atur measurements, and free tropospheric isoprene\nlevels were, as expected, very low. Limonene, alpha-pinene\nand beta-pinene were the most abundant monoterpene com-\npounds observed. Relatively high concentrations of 2-ethyl\nhexanol and some aldehydes were also seen in samples taken\nfrom within the forest canopy in the vicinity of Bukit Atur.\nThe concentrations of NO2, peroxy nitrate (RO2NO2) and\nalkyl nitrate (RONO2) were measured at Bukit Atur with a\nlaser induced fluorescence system (Aruffo et al., 2009). The\ndiurnal cycle of RO2NO2 followed the isoprene diurnal cy-\ncle, with maximum concentrations in the afternoon. Since\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem.

Hewitt et al.: The OP3 project: introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools\nRO2NO2 compounds are produced in the oxidation of iso-\nprene and other terpenoids, this result provides evidence for\nthe oxidation of BVOC in the vicinity of the forest canopy.\nAdditional evidence for the active photochemical processing\nof isoprene is provided by the increase in concentrations of\nits oxidation products, methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein,\nobserved in the afternoons.\nThe concentrations of HO2+RO2 were measured at\nBukit Atur using PEroxy Radical Chemical Amplification\n(PERCA) technology (Karunaharan et al., 2009) over 20\ndays in OP3-I and 29 days in OP3-III. Mean midday mixing\nratio of 33.5\u00b13.3 and 35.5\u00b13.5 parts per trillion (pptv) were\ncalculated from the continuous measurements of the sum of\nthe inorganic and organic peroxy radicals from OP3-I and\nOP3-III respectively. The mean net ozone production rate\nmay then be calculated using:\nN(O3)= kp[NO][HO2+RO2]\n\u2212{f \u00b7j (O1D)+k1[OH]+k2[HO2]}[O3]\nwhere kp is a combined rate coefficient for the oxidation of\nNO to NO2 by all peroxy radicals and f \u00b7j (O1D)[O3] repre-\nsents the fraction of ozone photolysed to yield O(1D) atoms\nand then OH (with f being the proportion of O(1D) atoms\nwhich react with H2O to give OH rather than being colli-\nsionally deactivated). The rate constants k1 and k2 are from\nthe ozone loss reactions:\nOH+O3 =HO2+O2 (R1)\nHO2+O3 =OH+2O2 (R2)\nThe net formation of ozone was found to be strongly depen-\ndent on the concentration of isoprene, having a linear sensi-\ntivity (e.g. dln(P (O3))\/dln(isoprene)=1)). Since HO2+RO2\nare produced during the oxidation of isoprene and other ter-\npenoids, taken together with the observations of MVK and\nmethacrolein formation, this result provides evidence for the\noxidation of BVOC in the vicinity of the forest canopy and\nof the role of isoprene in the formation of ozone in the near-\ncanopy environment during the daytime.\nEvidence of BVOC reactivity also comes from differen-\ntial optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) measurements.\nDOAS was used at Bukit Atur to make the first measure-\nments in a tropical rainforest of glyoxal (CHOCHO), one of\nthe major products of isoprene oxidation by OH. Mixing ra-\ntios much higher than in other rural locations were observed,\nwith a maximum of 1.6 ppbv and average around 600 pptv.\nHCHO was also measured, peaking at 4.5 ppbv and with an\naverage around 3 ppbv. Both species were closely correlated\nto isoprene (which should be their major source in this envi-\nronment), and peaked in the early afternoon. A box model\nindicates that the production efficiency of glyoxal from iso-\nprene is \u223c10%. Although glyoxal was significantly scav-\nenged during rain showers, it is mostly removed by reaction\nwith OH and photolysis (lifetime at midday \u223c2.3 h) rather\nthan uptake on background aerosol in this environment, be-\ncause, as discussed earlier, aerosol mass loadings were low.\nThere was a slight diurnal trend in ground-based O3 mea-\nsurements, with levels of\u223c5 ppbv at 06:00, rising to\u223c8 ppbv\nin mid afternoon. Note that the very small amplitude in\nthe diurnal pattern is typical of a hill-top site (Fowler et al.,\n2008) and contrasts with that observed at the in-canopy site\nand over the low-lying palm plantations (see below). These\nvalues are comparable to above canopy measurements made\nabove regions of Amazonia (Karl et al., 2007). Boundary\nlayer O3 levels also show an increase throughout the day, but\nat higher levels (10\u201313 ppbv), probably because the bound-\nary layer O3 is less depleted by deposition to the canopy\n(Matsuda et al., 2006; Cros et al., 2000). These boundary\nlayer values are slightly less than those measured over Ama-\nzonia and West Africa during the GABRIEL and AMMA\ncampaigns (Ganzveld et al., 2008; Saunois et al., 2009).\nThere is little vertical structure in the O3 mixing ratio at\nhigher heights above the rainforest, with levels in the free tro-\nposphere being very similar to those in the boundary layer.\nOzone vertical profiles were therefore more like those ob-\nserved during the monsoon over northern Australia, than\nthose observed during monsoon break periods (Heyes et al.,\n2009).\nConcentrations of OH display a clear diurnal cycle,\npeaking at solar noon, with significant concentrations ob-\nserved: up to 8.7\u00d7106 molecules cm\u22123 (60 min average) was\nrecorded on one day. During the GABRIEL campaign above\nAmazonia, average midday boundary layer OH concentra-\ntions were 5.75\u00d7106 molecules cm\u22123 (Martinez et al., 2008).\nAlthough j (O1D) levels and humidity were high, the rela-\ntively low O3 concentrations limit primary OH production.\nThe measured OH reactivity was very high, up to 87 s\u22121 (cor-\nresponding to a lifetime for OH approaching 10 ms). Accord-\ning to the measurements of reactive hydrocarbons (above),\nthis reactivity is dominated by reaction with isoprene, indi-\ncating that significant OH sources must be present \u2013 in ad-\ndition to primary production following ozone photolysis \u2013 in\norder to maintain the elevated levels of OH levels recorded\n(Whalley et al., 2010b). The OH diurnal profile was asym-\nmetric (i.e., lower post-noon than the equivalent time pre-\nnoon). This may be due to its main measured sink, iso-\nprene, being present at higher concentrations in the after-\nnoon, but the asymmetric profile could also result from other\nfactors that have yet to be identified. OH concentrations up to\n6\u00d7105 molecule cm\u22123 (60 min average) were also recorded\non several nights, consistent with measurements by other\ngroups in forested environments (Tan et al., 2001), with some\nresidual OH observed after j (O1D) had dropped to zero.\nMeasured concentrations of HO2 and the sum of HO2+RO2\ndisplayed similar profiles.\nBoundary layer OH concentrations recorded on the aircraft\nover Bukit Atur were similar to those measured at ground\nlevel, whereas aircraft HO2 concentrations were higher than\nmeasured at the ground, a reflection of the elevated NO levels\nAtmos.

A full description of the OH, HO2 and OH\nreactivity measurements is given in Whalley et al. (2009,\n2010a) and Edwards et al. (2009, 2010).\nThe non-refractory sub-micrometre aerosol as measured\nby aerosol mass spectrometry at the Bukit Atur ground site\nwas mostly composed of organics, sulphate, and ammonium,\nwith low levels of nitrate and chloride. Average loadings\nwere 0.74, 0.61, 0.21, 0.04 and 0.01 \u00b5g m\u22123, respectively,\ngiving a total aerosol loading of 1.61 \u00b5g m\u22123. The sulphate\nwas observed to be largely neutralised to ammonium sul-\nphate. Organics showed a diurnal profile peaking around\n21:00. The ensemble organic spectrum had a m\/z=44 to total\norganics ratio of 0.15%, with prominent peaks at m\/z=55 and\n53, features which would be considered typical of a partially\noxygenated organic aerosol (e.g., Hallquist et al., 2009). The\nsulphate showed no distinct diurnal profile, suggesting it was\nregional in nature, potentially from the anthropogenic back-\nground, volcanoes or oxidised dimethyl sulphate originating\nfrom marine phytoplankton (Dacey and Wakeham, 1986). Of\nall the gas and aerosol species measured at Bukit Atur, sul-\nphate aerosol most clearly showed the influence of regional-\nscale transport rather than local sources and sinks. Both ni-\ntrate and chloride showed strong nocturnal peaks that could\nbe caused by partitioning from the gas phase as the tempera-\nture falls and humidity increases at night.\nSlightly larger aerosol concentrations were measured from\nthe aircraft than the ground, both over the rainforest and\noil palm, with mean total loadings in the boundary layer of\n1.66 and 1.78 \u00b5g m\u22123, respectively. Aerosol loadings were\nmuch lower in the free troposphere, with an average total of\n0.22 \u00b5g m\u22123. Free-tropospheric aerosol showed a larger sul-\nphate contribution of 69%, compared with 43% in the bound-\nary layer.\nThe water uptake ability of the atmospheric aerosol at\nBukit Atur was probed in both the sub- and super-saturated\nregimes with the use of a Hygroscopicity Tandem Differen-\ntial Mobility Analyser (HTDMA; Cubison et al., 2005; Gy-\nsel et al., 2007) and Cloud Condensation Nucleus counter\n(CCNc; Roberts et al., 2005), respectively. Aerosol hygro-\nscopic growth factors (GF) at 90% relative humidity (RH)\nfor particles of dry diameter (D0) from 27 to 217 nm showed\nthe aerosol to be externally mixed, with a mean growth fac-\ntor (GFD0,90%) ranging between 1.3 and 1.6 with increasing\ndry diameter and multiple growth factor modes at each dry\nsize evident. A Scanning Mobility Particle Analyser (SMPS;\nTSI 3080) was operated upstream of the CCNc, to supply\nquasi-monodisperse aerosol in the size range 30 to 220 nm.\nCritical supersaturations (Sc) derived from fraction activated\nCCN spectra, showed a diurnal variation in supersaturation\nbetween 0.2 and 0.8% required to activate particles of a given\nD0, primarily in the dry diameter range 50 to 120 nm.\n4.2.3 Oil palm plantation measurements\nCampaign daytime average (10:00\u201314:00) isoprene fluxes\nmeasured at 15 m at the Sabahmas oil palm plantation site\nwere 8.6 mg m\u22122 h\u22121 during OP3-II (Misztal et al., 2010a).\nThis is four to seven times greater than the isoprene flux mea-\nsured at Bukit Atur (see above). The fluxes of other biogenic\nVOCs, including oxygenated species and more exotic com-\npounds (e.g. estragole: Misztal et al., 2010b), were smaller,\ncontributing \u223c15% of the total measured VOC emissions.\nNet fluxes of monoterpenes were very small (<1% of total\nVOC flux).\nFigure 9b shows diurnal cycles of data taken at the ground-\nbased site within the Sabahmas oil palm plantation. Species\nplotted are the same as for the Bukit Atur rainforest ground\nsite, with the exception of NO and NO2 which were not mea-\nsured at ground level at Sabahmas. Boundary layer NO and\nNO2 levels show slightly higher levels compared to the rain-\nforest but the scatter on the data (indicated by the 1\u03c3 error\nbars) is much larger. This is indicative of the high NOx con-\ncentrations observed in certain areas of the plantation land-\nscape, as described above. Free troposphere NO and NO2\nlevels over the plantation were again much lower and very\nsimilar to those observed over the rainforest.\nGround based isoprene data show a similar diurnal cycle\nto the rainforest, with near zero levels at night, but with an\nearlier peak at around 12:00. Isoprene concentrations are\nmuch higher in the plantation, with peak daytime levels of\n\u223c16 000 pptv. Isoprene concentrations in the boundary layer\nover the plantation show a very similar diurnal profile, but\nwith a significantly lower peak of \u223c5000 pptv. The ground-\nbased measurements were made at the top of the oil palm\ncanopy, and hence this difference may be explained by dilu-\ntion. Also, since the oil palm plantations are generally situ-\nated in low-lying, flat land, the aircraft measurements were\nalways made at a significant height above the ground level\nmeasurements, unlike at Bukit Atur where the aircraft was\nable to fly past the base of the GAW tower, located on a hill.\nMeasurements of O3 at the ground in the plantation ex-\nhibit a very different diurnal cycle compared to the rainfor-\nest, with near zero night-time concentrations and a peak of\n\u223c5 ppbv at 11:00\u201312:00. This is followed by a steady de-\ncrease throughout the day until O3 reaches close to zero at\naround 23:00. This general pattern is typical of that for a low-\nlying site, where O3 lost by reaction with NO emitted from\nfertilised plantation soils and deposition at night is not re-\nplenished by mixing from aloft, due to the more ready estab-\nlishment of a stable boundary layer compared with elevated,\nmore windy, sites (Fowler et al., 2008). Data taken in the\nboundary layer above the plantation show a similar diurnal\ncycle to the rainforest, with an increase throughout the day\nto a peak of \u223c15 ppbv. This mean value is 2 to 3 ppbv higher\nthan the rainforest levels, but as indicated by the 1\u03c3 error\nbars there is scatter in this value, which reflects the variabil-\nity in the NOx and its impact on O3 concentrations.

The error bars on the air-\ncraft data indicate 1\u03c3 standard deviations for data taken on the four\nflights.\ndeposition to the oil palm trees, reaction with NOx from local\nsources, and reaction with isoprene, are three possible con-\ntributing factors for the low concentrations and earlier peak\nof day-time O3 observed on the ground in the plantation.\nThe total aerosol loading, as measured by the AMS, at\nthe oil palm site was on average 1.6 \u00b5g m\u22123, similar to the\naerosol loading measured by AMS at the forest site (Nemitz\net al., 2009, 2010). The mass was dominated by organic\naerosol, which made up on average 65% of the total mass,\nwith sulphate contributing 20% of the total mass. The or-\nganic aerosol exhibits a clear diurnal trend with two maxima,\noccurring at approximately 08:00 and 15:00 local time. The\nensemble mass spectrum measured at the oil palm resem-\nbles the classic oxygenated organic aerosol spectrum (e.g.\nHallquist et al., 2009), dominated by mass fragment m\/z 44,\nresulting from carboxylic acid functionality. An examination\nof mass fragment-specific diurnal profiles indicates that frag-\nments thought to be associated with less oxygenated organic\naerosol make a smaller contribution to the afternoon max-\nimum in the organic mass relative to those masses arising\nfrom oxygenated fragments, e.g. m\/z 44.\nSulphate aerosol shows a slightly different trend in mass to\nthe total organics, with a broader maximum during the day-\ntime, although there was large day-to-day variability. Both\nthe nitrate and chloride fractions showed an obvious max-\nimum, coincident with the morning organic aerosol maxi-\nmum, but both lacked the increase in mass observed in the\norganic fraction during the afternoon.\n5 Modelling and assessment\nAs stated in the introduction above, a fundamental aim of\nthe OP3 project was to understand the role played by bio-\ngenic emissions from the tropical rainforest: what is the na-\nture of the emissions, how are they transformed and how do\nthese processes then impact local, regional and hemispheric\nscale atmospheric chemistry; what will be the implications\nof global change for these processes and their impacts?\nTo address these questions, the OP3 project employed a\nrange of models, varying in their spatial scale of interest and\nchemical complexity, as shown in Table 3. Thus, a model of\ntransport and chemistry through and above the forest canopy\nhas been used to address the canopy measurements, to study\nvertical transport of gas and aerosol species, their emission\nand deposition, and chemical transformation (Ryder et al.,\n2009). A range of chemical box models (some run along air\nparcel trajectories) has been employed to study local chem-\nistry, addressing both the ground based and aircraft measure-\nments. These very detailed models aim to inform the chemi-\ncal mechanisms used in our regional and global models that,\nin turn, are used to study the impact of the biogenic emis-\nsions at the regional and wider scales. They are also used to\ninvestigate transport and variability.\nUnderstanding the fast photochemistry processes (mainly\ninvolving HOx and ROx) is carried out using constrained box\nmodels. These use the observed concentrations of species\nproviding HOx sources, sinks and inter-conversion pathways,\nto calculate the concentrations of OH, HO2 and other short\nlived species such as the sum of peroxy radicals (RO2), for\ncomparison with observations. Insight from these calcula-\ntions allows our understanding of the complex organic chem-\nistry occurring in this region to be evaluated, the level of\nchemical complexity required to capture these processes to\nbe quantified and the impact of the approximations made in\nthe chemical transport models to be evaluated.\nThe constrained-box-model focus is split between the\nground-based and aircraft data. One investigation has used\nthe Master Chemical Mechanism, a near-explicit mechanism\nthat considers the degradation of a suite of hydrocarbons in\nthe atmosphere (Jenkin et al., 2003; Saunders et al., 2003).\nFor both ground and aircraft data, a zero-dimensional box\nmodel is constrained with the observed concentrations of\nlonger-lived species such as hydrocarbons, NOx, O3, rele-\nvant meteorological data and observed photolysis rates; the\nmodels predict radical concentrations which can be com-\npared with those measured. The ground-based model is a\ncontinuation of a previous modelling framework (e.g. Em-\nmerson et al., 2007) that has been used extensively for sim-\nilar comparisons (Heard and Pilling, 2003). The aircraft\nbased model uses the Dynamically Simple Model of Atmo-\nspheric Chemical Complexity (DSMACC) (Emmerson and\nEvans, 2009) model and follows previous aircraft based work\n(Jaegle et al, 2000; Olson et al., 2006).

(2009)\nthere is reasonable agreement between modelled and mea-\nsured OH on some days, but an under-prediction on oth-\ners. The OH loss for the OP3 campaigns was dominated\nby isoprene chemistry, with smaller contributions from \u03b3 t\nterpinene and limonene. \u03b3 -Terpinene becomes much more\nimportant at night-time, when isoprene emissions are effec-\ntively zero. Modelling of the aircraft data is in a more pre-\nliminary state but shows relatively good agreement between\nthe observed and simulated HO2 with poorer agreement for\nthe OH. Whether this reflects issues with making OH obser-\nvations from aircraft or with our understanding of the chem-\nistry of isoprene will require further analysis.\nReduced chemical mechanisms, of the kind traditionally\nemployed in global chemical transport models, have also\nbeen used in box model mode, to compare against the mea-\nsured constituent data and to investigate the significance of\nprocesses. Thus, the CiTTyCAT model (Wild et al., 1996;\nEvans et al., 2000; Emmerson et al., 2004; Donovan et al.,\n2005) has been used to study the chemical regimes probed\nby the OP3 measurements, both over the rainforest and over\npalm oil plantations, and to explore how local air quality\ncould be affected should palm oil (a major isoprene-emitter)\nbecome an even more dominant crop, replacing the rainfor-\nest. Hewitt et al. (2009) show that under these circumstances,\nwhat happens to local and regional-scale emissions of NOx\nwill be crucial. Without control of NOx emissions, the levels\nof ozone could become unacceptably high, damaging both\ncrop and human health.\nWe find that CiTTyCAT can represent the broad features of\natmospheric composition above a tropical rainforest (Pugh et\nal., 2010a). In particular, the model can fit daytime NOx and\nO3 chemistry. Ambient concentration measurements have\nbeen used to estimate a net NO flux of 5 \u00b5g N m\u22122 h\u22121. De-\nposition of intermediate VOC oxidation products can have\na very significant influence on their concentrations and the\nchemistry of the boundary layer, highlighting the need for\nfurther investigation into deposition processes over tropical\nforests.\nAnother box model study with a reduced chemical mech-\nanism has focussed on the ground-based measurements of\nozone and NOx (Pike et al., 2009). This study suggests that\nthe chemical mechanism included in the Cambridge global\nchemistry transport model, p-TOMCAT (Cook et al., 2007;\nVoulgarakis et al., 2009a, b) can reproduce the measurements\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/169\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 169\u2013199, 2010\n192 C. N. Hewitt et al.: The OP3 project: introduction, rationale, location characteristics and tools\nif a parametrization of mixing out of and into the boundary\nlayer is included.\nThe Cambridge p-TOMCAT global model has been used\nto look at regional-scale chemistry. Figure 10 (Pike et al.,\n2009) shows surface ozone concentrations from two calcu-\nlations for April 2008, with the model run at two differ-\nent spatial resolutions (approx 3\u25e6\u00d73\u25e6 and 0.5\u25e6\u00d70.5\u25e6, re-\nspectively). At the lower resolution (typical of multi-annual\nintegrations), the model significantly overestimates surface\nozone over Borneo. Little spatial structure is evident and de-\ntailed flight track comparisons (not shown) fail to reproduce\nmuch observed structure. In contrast, at the high resolution,\nthe model now captures a significant land \u2013 sea difference in\nsurface ozone, driven by deposition over the land. Modelled\nozone concentrations are still somewhat higher than observed\nbut are now closer to the observations.\n6 Conclusions\nThe overall aim of the OP3 project was to better understand\nthe interactions that exist between SE Asian rainforests, at-\nmospheric composition and, ultimately, the Earth\u2019s climate\nsystem. In pursuing this aim, an extensive field deployment\nwas carried out in 2008, supported by satellite data retrievals\nand modelling studies. The field deployment, from April to\nthe end of July 2008, comprised extensive composition and\nflux measurements within and above the rainforest canopy,\nalong with a more limited set of measurements in and above\nan oil palm plantation. Composition measurements across\nmost of the state of Sabah in northern Borneo, and out to sea\non both windward and leeward sides of the island, were pro-\nvided by flights of the FAAM BAe 146. Remote sensing of\nland cover has shown that the chosen sites were representa-\ntive of large areas of Borneo and the rest of insular SE Asia;\nlong-term meteorological and ozone data gathered as part of\nthe Global Atmosphere Watch programme show that weather\nand ozone mixing ratios during the time period of the field\ndeployment were typical of the long term record.\nComposition measurements show that the rainforest site\nwas not impacted significantly by anthropogenic pollution,\nand this is confirmed by satellite retrievals of NO2 and\nHCHO. The dominant modulators of atmospheric chemistry\nat the rainforest site were therefore emissions of BVOCs and\nsoil emissions of reactive nitrogen oxides. At the observed\nBVOC:NOx volume mixing ratio (\u223c100 pptv\/pptv), current\nchemical models suggest that daytime maximum OH con-\ncentrations should be ca. 105 radicals cm\u22123, but observed OH\nconcentrations were an order of magnitude greater than this.\nWe confirm, therefore, previous measurements which sug-\ngest that an unexplained source of OH must exist above trop-\nical forests (Lelieveld et al., 2008) and continue to interrogate\nthe data to find explanations for this.\nMarked differences in BVOC and NOx concentrations,\nand in BVOC fluxes, were measured in the rainforest and the\n 56 \n  \nFigure 10.

By an accident of the non-linearity of\nboundary-layer chemistry, ozone mixing ratios over the two\nlandscapes were similar, although plumes of higher ozone\nwere observed in air impacted by emissions from oil-palm\nprocessing plants.\nThe land-sea mosaic of SE Asia makes it difficult for\nglobal atmospheric chemistry-and-transport models run at\ntypical resolution to capture the observed atmospheric com-\nposition; runs at higher horizontal resolution provide much\nbetter agreement with measurements. A missing OH source\nnotwithstanding, simple chemistry schemes, as currently im-\nplemented in most global models, can match observed ozone\nand NOx diurnal patterns, if a parametrization of mixing out\nof and into the boundary layer is included.\nOverall, the SE Asian rainforest has shown itself to have\nsignificant differences from the more intensively studied\nAtmos.
