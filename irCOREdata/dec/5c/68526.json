INTRODUCTION\nThe origin of the vortex lines1 that seem to be universally present2 in He II\nrepresents an interesting question to which the answer remains incomplete. These\nvortices are extremely important because they are believed to seed the creation of\nthe array of parallel vortex lines that appear when a vessel of He II is rotated, as\nwell as the dense random tangles of vortex line that can be generated in a ther-\nmal counterflow.3 Awschalom and Schwarz found2 that remanent vorticity seemed\nto appear at the lambda transition and to decay towards a constant, presumed\nmetastable, density that was apparently independent of the history of the cooling\nprocess.\nOne possible way2 in which vortices might be created at the lambda transition\nrelates to the flow and convection that may be occurring in the liquid above the\ntransition. Any such motions will effectively be converted to quantized vortex lines\nwith the onset of long-range order, as the system cools through the transition. A\nsecond, quite different, mechanism relates to critical fluctuations of the superfluid\nPublished in J. Low Temp. Phys. 93, 1059-1067 (1993).\norder parameter close to the transition, which must also correspond to vortices.4\nThe latter process is of some topical interest in view of the suggestion5 that it may\nprovide a basis for demonstrating, in the laboratory, the Kibble mechanism6 for\ncreation of the topological defects that seeded galaxy formation.\nThe analogy between liquid helium and the early universe arises as follows.\nViewed in terms of Ginzburg-Landau theory,7 the lambda transition may be con-\nsidered as though it were a phase transition of second order, with a potential con-\ntribution to the free energy of form\nV = \u03b1|\u03c8|2 + 1\n2\n\u03b2|\u03c8|4 (1)\nwhere the complex order parameter \u03c8 is given by a solution of the Ginzburg-\nPitaevskii equation. Above the transition, the equilibrium value of |\u03c8| = 0 (al-\nthough there will also be thermal fluctuations to finite values: see below).Below\nthe transition, however, |\u03c8| acquires a finite equilibrium value and V [Re(\u03c8), Im(\u03c8)]\ntakes on the same \u201csombrero hat\u201d shape as the corresponding cosmological free en-\nergy expressed in terms of Higgs fields. In the early universe, a symmetry-breaking\nphase transition from false vacuum to true vacuum is believed to have occurred\n\u223c 10\u221234s after the big bang, once the temperature had fallen \u223c 1027K. Although\nthere are many variants of the basic model, both with and without inflation, it\nis believed that a variety of topological defects8 would have been produced in the\ntransition because of an event horizon that prevented adjacent regions from being\ncausally connected. One type of defect, which appears to have the appropriate\nproperties for it to have played a role in galaxy formation, is the cosmic string - a\nthin tube of false vacuum. The analogous object in He II is a quantized vortex line.\nThe idea of using the lambda transition to model the cosmological phase tran-\nsition was due to Zurek. His suggestion5 was that a volume of He I should be ex-\npanded fast from an initial temperature and pressure (Ti, PI) to final values (Tf , Pf ),\nas sketched in Fig 1, so that it would undergo the transition to He II while still re-\ntaining frozen-in fluctuations from above the lambda point. The nascent superfluid\nwould therefore form with a spatially incoherent order parameter, corresponding to\na large density of vortex lines, modelling the cosmic strings of the early universe.\nThis scenario depends on the fact that the liquid can (in principle) be expanded at\nany velocity up to that of first sound, whereas the propagation velocity for changes\nin the order parameter is equal to the (much slower) velocity of second sound.\nIn this paper, we report the initial results obtained from an expansion cryostat\nwhich we have built to carry out Zurek\u2019s proposed experiment5 and to test his\npredictions.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nA full description of the expansion cryostat will be given in a later paper but,\nbriefly, the arrangement was as follows. A sample of \u223c 10\u22123 kg of isotopically pure9\nliquid 4He is held within a small chamber whose walls consist of a bronze bellows,\nas indicated diagrammatically in Fig 2. The chamber is secured at the top, but its\nbottom surface can be pulled up to compress the liquid, or released to expand it\nas shown by the arrows, using a mechanical linkage from the top of the cryostat.\nThe chamber is held within an evacuated enclosure immersed in a cryogenic bath\nof liquid 4He at \u223c 2.0K. The cell is fitted with a capacitance pressure gauge and a\ncarbon resistance thermometer. The temperature of the sample can be adjusted by\nmeans of a breakable thermal link to the surrounding bath, or by a heater.\nTo detect the vortices that are expected5 to be produced in an expansion, there\nis a small insert in the cell carrying a heater and bolometer for the generation and\ndetection of second sound. The bolometer signal passes via a FET preamplifier\nin the bath at \u223c 2.0K, and thence to a main amplifier at room temperature. At\nthe moment of the expansion, a sequence of second sound pulses is initiated, and\ntheir attenuation in the \u223c 4 mm of He II separating bolometer and heater provides\na measure1 of the vortex line density. Typically, the cell is expanded from an\ninitial pressure Pi = 29.6 bar and temperature Ti = 1.81 K, through the lambda\ntransition, to final values of Pf = 6.9 bar and Tf = 2.04 K, in a time \u03c4e \u223c 3 ms.\nDuring the following 1.7 s, some 170 single-pulse second sound signals are recorded\nby a Nicolet 1280 data processor. About 600 s later, at exactly the same pressure\nand temperature, a reference signal is averaged and recorded, defining the signal\namplitude in the (virtual) absence of vortices.\nThe signal sequence is analysed automatically in two quite separate ways. First,\nany given signal is cross-correlated with the reference signal; the ratio of the maxi-\nmum of the cross-correlogram to that of the auto-correlogram of the reference signal\ngives the ratio of the signal magnitude to that of the reference signal. Secondly, a\nleast squares method is used to find the factor by which the reference signal must\nbe multiplied in order to obtain a best fit to the signal being analysed, after each\nhas first been baseline-corrected to an average of zero.\n3. RESULTS\nSome typical second sound signals, recorded shortly after an expansion, are\nshown in the inset to Fig 3. Although the signals at the shortest times (lower\nsignal in each inset) are rather noisy, owing to mechanical vibrations caused by\nthe expansion itself, coupled to a slight microphony of the low level electronics,\nit is immediately evident that the expansion leads to a considerable increase in\nattenuation. This is true both of expansions that take the system through the\nlambda transition, and of ones that start from below the transition i.e. with the\nsample already superfluid; but the attenuation is larger in the former case.\nThe evolution of the signal magnitude, expressed as a percentage of the refer-\nence signal, is shown as a function of time in the main part of Fig 3. The circled\ndata points are for an expansion through the transition, and the triangles show\nwhat happens in an expansion from almost the same starting conditions but just\nbelow the transition. The results shown were all based on the least squares signal\nanalysis; those from the correlation analysis were in agreement within experimental\nerror and seldom differred by more than 2%.\nTo enhance the signal\/noise ratio, groups of adjacent signals were averaged\ntogether prior to analysis. This reduced, but did not eliminate, the effect of noise\ndue to the mechanical vibrations; inevitably, the process was least effective where\nit was most needed, at very short times, where the size of the averaging groups had\nto be kept small (or equal to unity) to prevent distortion. The results shown in\nFig 3 have all been enhanced in this way, reducing the scatter of the data but not\ncausing any detectable systematic shifts.\n4. DISCUSSION\nIt must be emphasized that the results presented in the preceding section are\nof a preliminary character. Data of higher quality are to be anticipated once the\nmicrophony of the cryogenic preamplifier system has been reduced and other im-\nprovements incorporated, including better temperature control and thermal isola-\ntion of the sample. Nonetheless, it is of interest to discuss the initial results in the\nlight of the theoretical predictions and to draw some tentative conclusions.\nThe large transient second sound attenuation observed after the system has\nfollowed an expansion trajectory through the lambda transition (circled data in Fig\n3) is qualitatively in excellent accord with Zurek\u2019s prediction.5 It must be borne\nin mind, however, that the geometry of the expansion is far from being ideal. In\nprinciple, to entirely avoid vortex creation by fluid flow, one would wish to contrive\na spherically symmetrical expansion, or a longitudinal expansion of a cylinder with\nstretchable walls, but this appears to be impossible in practice. The actual cell\napproximates the latter situation, but both the convolutions of the bellows and also\nthe presence of the second sound heater and bolometer within the cell represent\nnonidealities that will inevitably result in some fluid movement parallel to surfaces\nduring the expansion. The expansion results in the bottom of the cell dropping a\ndistance of \u223c 4 mm in \u223c 3 ms\u22121. Although the resultant transient velocity is quite\nfast (average \u223c 1 ms\u22121), we may note that there is no relative motion at all between\nthe top and bottom surfaces of the cell and helium adjacent to them; the flow that\noccurs will presumably be due to the second order effects mentioned above. It is\nnot obvious how to calculate the vortex line density likely to be produced by such\nflows, especially in view of their very short duration, but we may guess that it is\nlikely to be considerably smaller than that expected to be produced through the\nZurek mechanism.5\nTo try to estimate the vortex line density immediately following the expansion\nby extrapolation of the data back to time t = 0, we note that the spontaneous decay\nrate dL\/dt of homogeneous superfluid turbulence is proportional10 to \u2212L2, where\nL is the length of vortex line per unit volume. Using the same nomenclature and\nsymbols as Schwarz and Rozen11 and the earlier papers by Schwarz,12 we may write\ndL\ndt\n= \u2212\u03b1Il\u03b2c\u22121L L2 (2)\nwhere the constants \u03b1, Il, \u03b2 and c\n\u22121\nL are all known, at least within limits, from\nearlier work on turbulence generated in thermal counterflow, and its free decay.\nIntegrating (2), we find immediately that the evolving line length per unit volume\nis given by\nL\u22121 = \u03b1Il\u03b2c\u22121L t+ L\n\u22121\ni (3)\nwhere Li is the initial line density at t = 0, which we take to be the instant when\nthe expansion stops. The relationship between the line density and the attenuation\nof a second sound signal is known1 from experiments on rotating helium, and for\npresent purposes can be expressed in the form\nL =\n8u2ln(S0\/S)\n3B\u03bad\n(4)\nwhere u2 is the velocity of second sound, S0 and S are the signal amplitudes in the\nabsence and presence of vortices, B is a temperature dependent parameter1, \u03ba =\n9.97 \u00d710\u22124 cm2 s\u22121 is the quantum of circulation, and d is the heater\/bolometer\nseparation. From (3) and (4) it is evident that a plot of [ln (S0\/S)]\n\u22121 as a function\nof t should yield a straight line from whose ordinate intercept Li can be determined.\nSuch a plot is shown in Fig 4 for the initial, rapidly rising, part of the evolution.\nFrom the intercept of a line fitted to the data by the method of least squares, we\ncalculate that Li \u223c 107 cm\u22122. This is a very large value: to place it in context, we\nmay note that to create a comparable density by rotation of a container of He II\nwould require an angular velocity of \u223c 4000 radians s\u22121. It seems implausible that\na line density of this magnitude could be created in the very brief episode of fluid\nflow during the expansion, and we conclude that it must arise mainly through the\nZurek mechanism.5\nIt is evident from Fig 3 that smaller, but still very large, initial line densities\nare created by expansions that do not pass through the lambda transition (from\nthe triangle data we obtain Li = 2 \u00d7106 cm\u22122). Again, there will obviously be\na contribution from vortices produced by flow, but the density seems implausibly\nlarge to account for entirely in this way. A possible explanation can be found in\nWilliams theory4 of the lambda transition as a vortex-driven phenomenon. At the\nstarting point, very close to the lambda transition T\u03bb, there will be a relatively\nlarge equilibrium density of vortices. Following the expansion, the line density will\ntherefore decay towards a new, lower, equilibrium value appropriate to the larger\nfinal value of (T\u03bb \u2212 T ). Thus, the experiment can perhaps be regarded as a rather\ndirect way of revealing the large vortex density predicted to exist close to T\u03bb.\nThe growth of the signal following both types of expansion (Fig 3) exhibits\nevidence of a small local maximum or anomaly near t = 200 ms, separating a\nregime of fast vortex decay from a second regime characterised by a much slower\ndecay rate. Similar effects have been seen previously in the decay of turbulence\ngenerated by thermal counterflow,11,13,14 though not14 in the turbulence generated\nmechanically. The effect has been discussed11 by Schwarz and Rozen.\n5. CONCLUSION\nThe preliminary results of the expansion experiment, reported above, are con-\nsistent with Zurek\u2019s prediction5 that a fast adiabatic passage through the lambda\ntransition would result in copious vortex production. In common with some recent\nexperiments on phase transitions in liquid crystals,15,16 these observations provide\nsupport for the ideas underlying the Kibble mechanism of galaxy formation.6,8 Be-\ncause the velocity of second sound tends to zero at T\u03bb, it is to be expected that\nslower expansions, or temperature sweeps, through the transition will also lead to\nsignificant vortex creation which, in the latter case, would contribute to the rema-\nnent vorticity observed earlier.2 The smaller, but still large, vortex densities created\nby expansions from just below T\u03bb may represent confirmation of the existence of a\nlarge equilibrium vortex density4 corresponding to critical fluctuations of the order\nparameter close to the transition.\nFurther investigations are now in progress to explore the influence of the ex-\npansion rate, the fractional molar volume change in the expansion, the starting\ntemperature for expansions from below T\u03bb, and other relevant parameters.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nStimulating correspondence with W H Zurek is gratefully acknowledged.

It seems improbably thata line density of this magnitude could be created in the very brief episode of fluidflow during the expansion, 'and we conclude that it must arise mainly through theZurek mechanism.5 '\nIt is evident from Fig 3 that smaller, but still very large, initial line densitiesare created by expansions that do not pass through the lambda transition (fromthe triangle data we obtain L; = 2 X 106 cm-2). Again, there will obviously be\nFigure 4: Plot of inverse ln (S0\/S) against time t over 200 ms following an expansion\nthrough the lambda transition to enable the initial line density at t = 0 to be extrapolated.\n3\n"}
