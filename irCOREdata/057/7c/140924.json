It has been shown that, for highest \nsensitivity, the LPG should be designed to couple light from the propagating core mode to a \ncladding mode at a wavelength near the phase matching turning point [6], which is characterised \nby the generation of dual resonant bands that show sensitivities of opposite sign.  This has been \nexploited to measure temperature and refractive index with high sensitivity [6]. \n \nIt has been shown that the transmission spectrum of an LPG exhibits a high sensitivity to \nthe optical properties of coatings of materials of refractive index higher than that of the cladding \nwhen the coating is of thickness of order 200 nm [7,8,9]. This sensitivity has been exploited to \ndemonstrate a range of chemical sensors, for example,  pH [10], copper [11] and DNA damaging \nagents [12]. To date, the studies of the response of LPG transmission spectra to the deposition of \nnanostructured coatings has focussed on resonance bands corresponding to coupling to the lower \norder cladding modes, operating at wavelengths below their dispersion turning point. In this \npaper, the response of resonance features designed to appear near the cladding modes\u2019 dispersion \nturning points to the deposition of nanostructured coatings is investigated.   \n \n 3 \nTheory \nA long period grating is a core-cladding mode coupling device, consisting of a periodic \nmodulation of the propagation constants of the modes of a fibre. The modulation typically has a \nperiod in the range 100 m - 1000 m and may be induced using a variety of techniques, \nincluding UV laser irradiation [1], CO2 laser irradiation [13] and exposure to an electric arc [14]. \nEfficient coupling between the core and cladding modes occurs only where there is significant \noverlap between the electric field profiles of the modes. Resonant bands corresponding to \ncoupling from the guided core mode to a discrete set of symmetrical cladding modes appear in \nthe transmission spectrum of the fibre, centred at discrete wavelengths that are governed by the \nphase matching expression\n1\n.  \n \n  \n)(\n)(\nN\nnn xcladcore\nx\n       (1) \nwhere \u03bb(x) represents the wavelength at which coupling occurs to the LP0x mode, ncore is the \neffective refractive index of the mode propagating in the core of the fibre, nclad(x)  is the effective \nindex of the LP0x cladding mode,  is the period of the LPG and N is an integer representing the \norder of diffraction. The efficiency of coupling to the asymmetric modes is small, and thus in \ngeneral no attenuation bands corresponding to this coupling are visible in the transmission \nspectrum. \n \nCalculation of the core and cladding modes\u2019 dispersions allows the prediction of the \ncoupling wavelength as a function of the period of the grating, as plotted in figure 1 (a) for \nperiods in the range 350 m - 450 m and over a wavelength range 750 nm \u2013 1150 nm, selected \n 4 \nto match the experimental constraints imposed by the use of a CCD spectrometer to monitor the \ntransmission spectrum of an LPG fabricated in a fibre with cut off wavelength in the visible \nregion of the spectrum.  The data plotted in Figure 1 were calculated using the LP approximation \nto calculate the dispersion of the core and cladding modes. \n \nIn the regime depicted in figure 1 (a), the coupling is to the lower order cladding modes \nLP01 \u2013 LP08, with the graphs showing a positive gradient across the wavelength range. For \nshorter periods, as shown in figure 1(b), coupling takes place to higher order cladding modes, \nThe behaviour in this regime is markedly different, with the phase matching condition showing  \na turning point in the wavelength range of interest. The wavelength at which the turning point \noccurs decreases with increasing wavelength. It should be noted that all cladding modes will \nexhibit a turning point, however for the lower order modes this lies at longer wavelengths, \noutside the range of interest here. \n \nIt is thus possible to select a period where the coupling to a single cladding mode occurs \nat two wavelengths. As the period changes, or the difference in the core and cladding mode \neffective indices change in response, for example, to a change in temperature or in the \nsurrounding refractive index, the central wavelengths of the dual resonance bands move in \nopposite directions. It has been demonstrated theoretically and experimentally that the LPG \nresonance bands may exhibit their highest sensitivity to external perturbations at their phase \nmatching turning point [6]. Thus to design a device to operate at a specified wavelength with \nhigh sensitivity to external perturbation, a cladding mode and period that produce a turning point \nat that wavelength should be selected. \n 5 \n \nExperiment \nLPGs of length 30 mm and of period 80 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm were fabricated in Fibrecore SM750, a \nsingle mode optical fibre with cut-off wavelength 700 nm. The photosensitivity of the fibre was \nenhanced by pressurizing it in hydrogen for a period of 2 weeks at 150 bar at room temperature.  \nThe LPGs were fabricated in  a point-by-point fashion, illuminating the fibre by the output from \na frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser, operating at 266nm. The transmission spectrum of the \noptical fibre was recorded by coupling the output from a tungsten-halogen lamp into the fibre, \nand analysing the transmitted light using a fibre coupled CCD spectrometer. A typical \ntransmission spectrum, illustrating the split resonance bands, is shown in figure 2 (a).  \n \nThe evolution of the resonance bands in response to increasing coating thickness was \ninvestigated by depositing a film of  \u03c9-tricosenoic acid, which has a refractive index of 1.57 and \na molecular length of 2.6 nm [15], onto the section of optical fibre containing the LPG  using the \nLangmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique [7]. The LB technique facilitates deposition of the material \none molecular layer at a time onto a substrate. The \u03c9-tricosenoic acid was spread from dilute \nchloroform solutions (0.1 mg mL\n\u22121\n) onto the pure water sub-phase (conductivity 18M cm) of \none compartment of a Nima Technology Model 2410A LB trough, left for 20 min at 20 \n\u25e6\nC, and \ncompressed at 0.5 cm\n2\n s\n\u22121\n (0.1% s\n\u22121\n of total surface area). Deposition was achieved at a surface \npressure of 26 m Nm\n\u22121\n and a transfer rate of 8 mm min\n\u22121\n. The fibre containing the LPG was \npositioned vertically so that its long axis was aligned with the dipping direction and was \nalternately raised and lowered through the floating monolayer at the air\u2013water interface to \ndeposit the coating. The fibre was placed under tension, to ensure no bend-induced changes to \n 6 \nthe transmission spectrum [16,17]. Transmission spectra were recorded after the deposition of \neach monolayer, with the LPG below and above the water sub-phase for alternate layers. The \neffect of the presence of the coating material on the split resonance bands is shown in figure 2 \n(b). \n \nResults and Discussion \nThe response of the central wavelengths of the resonance bands to layer by layer increases in the \nthickness of the coating deposited onto the LPG of period 80 \u03bcm is illustrated in the grey scale \nplot shown in figures 3 (a) and (b). In figure 3, a transmission of 100% is represented by white \nand 0% by black. The dark line originating at a wavelength of 575 nm in the uncoated LPG, \nrepresents the resonance band corresponding to first order coupling to the  LP023 cladding mode. \nThis resonance band exhibits the typical behaviour reported previously for nanoscale coating  \ndeposition onto LPGs, in that the resonance band undergoes a blue shift, showing a region of \nhigh sensitivity that characterises the \u201cmode transition region\u201d, in which one of the lower order \ncladding modes becomes phase matched to a mode of the waveguide formed by the coating \nmaterial. In this region the effective indices of the cladding modes change rapidly with \nincreasing coating thickness [18, 19], which, from equation 1, causes a corresponding change in \nthe central wavelength of the resonance bands. \n \nThe LPG was designed to access the dispersion turning point of the LP024 mode, generating two \nclosely spaced resonance bands, centred at  700 nm and 750 nm, in the transmission spectrum of \nthe uncoated 80 \u03bcm period LPG surrounded by air. As the film thickness increases the central \nwavelengths of the two bands shift in opposite directions, as plotted in figure 4. As the thickness \n 7 \nincreases beyond the cladding mode transition region, the sensitivity to coating thickness \nreduces. The effect repeats as the coating thickness is increased further. \n \nComparison of figures 3(a) and 3 (b) shows the effect of monitoring the transmission \nspectrum with the LPG above and below the water subphase, as result of the refractive index \nsensitivity of the LPG. This indicates the need to consider the medium in which the LPG is \nimmersed for sensing applications. It is interesting to note that, leading the response of each of \nthe dominant resonance bands, there is a resonance band of considerably reduced extinction. It is \nsuggested that these may correspond to coupling to an asymmetric cladding mode. \n \nIt can be seen from figure 4 that the sensitivity of the resonant wavelengths to the coating \nthickness exhibits two gradients. The initial response shows a sensitivity to coating thickness of \n0.27 nm \/ nm for the red shifted band, and  - 0.25 nm\/nm for the blue shifted band, over a \nthickness range from 0 nm to 180 nm. The  region of highest sensitivity lies within the transition \nregion, from 180 nm to 300 nm, where the peak sensitivity is 0.47 nm \/ nm for the red shifted \nband, and  - 0.62 nm \/ nm for the blue shifted band.  \n \nTo investigate the influence of the period of the LPG on the sensivivty of the coated LPG \nto the thickness of the coating, the response of the transmission spectrum of the LPG of period \n100 m was investigated. The results are shown in the multimedia file in figure 5, and in the \ngrey scale images in figure 6. In this case, the dispersion turning point of mode LP024 is accessed \nat 800 nm for a coating thickness of order 200 nm, which is coincident with the onset of the first \nmode-transition-region. Initially, there is no band in the 800 nm wavelength range. As the film \n 8 \nthickness increases, a broad attenuation band develops and splits in two, with the central \nwavelengths of the two bands shifting in opposite directions, as plotted in figure 7.  The peak \nsensitivity to coating thickness is 0.98 nm \/ nm for the red shifted band, and  -1.45 nm \/ nm for \nthe blue shifted band, over a thickness range from 220 nm to 300 nm. Clearly, the measurement \nof the wavelength separation of the bands will allow further increased sensitivity. To illustrate \nthe improvement in sensitivity, the highest sensitivity exhibited by a 1\nst\n order coupling resonance \nband of a 400 m period LPG, fabricated in the same type of fibre, is 0.5 nm \/ nm\n20\n.  It is \ninteresting to note that the 2\nnd\n order coupling dual resonance bands shown in  [20], originating at \na wavelength of approximately 800 nm, equivalent to the results shown in figure 3 (a) here, also \nexhibit sensivities of order 1 nm \/nm. Optimisation of the sensitivities of the 2\nnd\n order resonance \nbands is currently being investigated. \n \nThe dual resonant bands show their highest sensitivity to external perturbation when the \nband is at the phase matching turning point. Thus the coincidence of the generation of the dual \nresonance band with the onset of the 1\nst\n transition region, where the cladding mode indices are \nmost sensitive to the coating\u2019s optical properties [Error! Bookmark not defined.], ensures that \nmaximum sensitivity is obtained. Careful choice of the grating period, taking into account the \nfibre properties and the refractive index of the coating material, is needed to ensure optimum \nsensitivity. While, in principle, the LPG sensor exhibits its highest sensitivity to all external \nperturbations at the phase matching turning point, it should be noted that, appropriate choice of \ncore and cladding materials can allow the phase matching condition to specific cladding modes \nto be insensitive to, for example temperature, eliminating cross-sensitivity issues [6]. In addition, \n 9 \ncross-sensitivity effects can be minimized by appropriate packaging or by exploiting the different \nsensitivities of each resonance band to different measurands [1]. \n \nSummary \nAn investigation of the response of LPG dual resonance bands near the dispersion turning point \nto the deposition of a nanostructured coating has been presented. Appropriate design of the \ndevice, taking into account the properties of the optical fibre, the period of the LPG and the \nrefractive index of the coating material can  ensure that mode dispersion turning point of the \nLPG coincides with the mode-transition-region that characterises LPGs with nanostructured \ncoatings, ensuring optimum sensitivity to the coating\u2019s optical properties. The ability to deposit, \nin a layer by layer fashion, materials onto an LPG that change their optical properties in response \nto a particular chemical species [10, 11, 12], offers an exciting prospect for the development of \nchemical sensors with high sensitivity and specificity.  \n \nThe authors are grateful for the support of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC) UK for its support of this work. \n 10 \nReferences \n1 V.
