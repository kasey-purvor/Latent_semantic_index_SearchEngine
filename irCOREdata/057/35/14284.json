It is our view that the task given to the\nstudent is central to the success or otherwise of the learning experience. In this paper, we\ndiscuss the need for the adaptation of traditional face-to-face tasks when these are\nincorporated in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments.\nWe focus on critical issues in relation to the implementation of CSCL tasks including:\nthe appropriateness of the medium for the task, the role of individuals, the volume\nof work involved, the time allocated for tasks or sub-tasks, and, the assessment\nprocedures.\nIn this paper we describe and evaluate two case studies that illustrate the importance of\nthe appropriateness of the task in computer-supported co-operative learning. Both case\nstudies (taught by one of the authors) involve final-year Information Management\nundergraduates in on-campus modules. Our findings indicate that the task must allow the\nmodule outcomes to be achieved (and assessed if necessary), and must be supported by\nsoftware tools which facilitate effective student learning. If it does, and the assessment\nmechanism is appropriate, the benefits include improved motivation to participate in\ndiscussion, improved student learning, and the ability to assess individual performance in\ngroup activities.\nIntroduction\nThe study of learning in collaborative electronic environments is becoming established as\nComputer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) - an emergent sub-discipline of the\nmore established Computer Supported Co-operative Work (CSCW) discipline (Webb,\n1995). Using computers for the development of shared understanding through collabora-\ntion has been explored by Crook who suggests that success may depend partly on having a\nclearly specified purpose or goal (Crook, 1994). It is our view that the appropriateness of\n33\nKothy Buckner and Kate Morss The importance of task appropriateness in computer-supported collaborative learning\nthe task given to the student is central to the success or otherwise of the learning\nexperience. However, the tasks that are given to facilitate collaborative learning in face-to-\nface situations are not always suitable for direct transfer to the electronic medium. It may\nbe necessary to consider redesigning these tasks in relation to the medium in which they are\nto be undertaken and the functionality of the electronic conferencing software used.\nThe way in which CSCL tasks are implemented in terms of assessment of learning\noutcomes (allocation of marks to individuals and\/or to the entire group), and group\nprocess and operation (e.g. anonymity, role of individual, role of tutor) is also significant.\nThe enforced requirement (or otherwise) to participate in assessed or non-assessed\nactivities is likely to affect the amount and quality of contribution in any CSCL activity\n(McAteer et ah, 1997). Slavin (1996) examines in depth the theoretical perspectives which\ncould help to explain student achievement in co-operative learning (not necessarily CSCL)\nsituations. He suggests that factors affecting achievement include group and individual\naccountability, social and group cohesion, and the ability to learn directly from peers and\nindirectly from supporting and instructing peers. These are issues that we consider in the\nwork presented here. In this paper we describe and evaluate two campus-based case studies\nthat illustrate the importance of task appropriateness in computer-supported collaborative\nlearning.\nThe case studies\nCase Study I: Computer-assisted learning: electronic seminar presentation\nThe first case study is one element of a final-year optional module in computer-assisted\nlearning provided on the BA (Hons) Information Management course at Queen Margaret\nCollege. As part of the assessment, students used COW software (Conferencing on the\nWeb, http:\/\/thecity.sfsu.edu\/COW2\/, an asynchronous computer conferencing program,\nhosted by NetLinkS http:\/\/netways.shef.ac.uk\/ at the University of Sheffield) to deliver an\nelectronic seminar presentation, lead and finally summarize the ensuing discussion of the\ntopic. Students were graded according to their ability both to lead and to contribute to the\ndebate. Each student was asked to select a topic for their seminar presentation and two or\nthree students (in a class of 13) were assigned as conference leaders to each of six topics. In\ntheir role as conference leaders students were required to make an individual opening\nstatement of 500 words incorporating appropriate references from print and electronic\nsources by a specific date. Contributors had one week to make two contributions to each of\nthe conferences they were assigned. They were required to take into account the\noriginator's opening statement and contributions from other participants, incorporate\nadditional evidence from print and\/or electronic sources, and reflect on their own\nexperience. The discussion was followed by a 500-word closing statement by each con-\nference leader. The conference leaders were expected to be proactive in stimulating\ndiscussion. Each student was assigned by the lecturer as a contributor to two additional\nconferences and was required to participate in one further conference of their own choice.\nThis element of the module accounted for 33 per cent of the marks. No group marks were\nawarded for this activity.\nCase Study 2: Human factors for information managers: problem-solving\nThe second case study is one element of an undergraduate final-year compulsory module\nin Human Factors for Information Managers which operates within a networked learning\n34\nAii-J Volume 7 Number I\nenvironment (NLE) (Buckner and Davenport, 1996). The collaborative aspect discussed\nhere involved the students in a problem-solving activity that used Netscape Navigator\nNews as a platform for asynchronous discussion and electronic submission of an agreed\nsolution. Each group of four students (in a class of 24) was allocated to a specific problem\nwhich was accessible via the NLE. Much of the information required to solve the problem\nwas available within the NLE, although traditional print material and other online\nresources were also utilized. Students were informed that all discussion and debate should\ntake place online in the newsgroup and that this electronic record would form the basis for\nthe individual and group assessment. Additionally they were allowed to use email to pass\ndocuments between each other provided that they copied any such transactions to the\ntutors. It was felt that this might be an easier mode of working as they neared a final\noutcome for the group solution to the problem. Students were advised to work together as\na team to solve the problem and it was suggested that they might want to assign different\nroles to specific individuals, e.g. moderator\/team leader, or to take responsibility for\ngathering information on specific topics. The final solution was to be no more than 500\nwords long. A total of 30 per cent of the marks available for this module was allocated to\nthe problem-solving activity, 15 per cent for the individual contribution and 15 per cent for\nthe group solution to the problem.\nEvaluation of the case studies\nA multi-instrument evaluation methodology was adopted for both case studies (Draper et\nah, 1994). Questionnaires with a mix of open-ended and attitudinal questions were used to\nobtain feedback about the tasks undertaken, the appropriateness of the software provided\nfor performing the task and operational issues. There were nine respondents from Case\nStudy 1 (69 per cent), 18 respondents from Case Study 2 (75 per cent). A focus group\ndiscussion (involving three students who had participated in both case studies) was under-\ntaken by an independent researcher to enable the issues to be explored in more depth. In\naddition, the students' assessments (electronic discussion, electronic conference presenta-\ntions and debates) were examined.\nAnalysis and discussion\nIn both case studies the students were quite clear about the nature of the exercise (the\ntask). Their roles within the conferences and newsgroup were understood, although these\nwere more clearly defined by the tutor in the seminar presentation case study.\nIn Case Study 1 (Seminar Presentation) more than three-quarters of the students thought\nthat they were better infonned both as a presenter (or seminar leader) and as a contributor\nthan in face-to-face discussions. There was less tutor intervention than in face-to-face\nseminars where student contributors are often reluctant to take an active part in discussion\nabout another student's topic. The tutor and students thought that contributions to\ndiscussion were of a higher standard than in traditional seminars. Students felt that: i) it\nwas easier to recap on earlier parts of the discussion, ii) they were able to follow up, in an\ninfonned way, on responses from other students, and iii) the medium encouraged more\nopen participation (particularly by the more reserved students).\n35\nKathy Buckner and Kate Morss The importance of task appropriateness in computer-supported collaborative learning\nReferring to traditional seminars one student stated:\n. . . in the classroom situation . . . maybe two or three people speak all the time and\npeople tend to sit back and not bother to say anything.\nA second student agreed:\n. . . or if somebody is actually saying what you are thinking there is no point. . . you\ncoming out and saying it as well.\nIn Case Study 2 (Problem-solving), students felt that using newsgroups was beneficial for\nsharing research findings but made it harder to determine a final solution to the problem\nthan if they had been using face-to-face communication. There was a feeling that they were\n'waiting' for responses, that it was more time-consuming and less 'instant' than face-to-face\ndebate. Some groups (with the approval of the lecturer) resorted to meeting face-to-face to\nproduce the final submission document.\nThe quality and quantity of contributions was affected by two main factors: assessment\nand motivation. In both case studies the students' ongoing contribution to the discussion\nwas assessed as well as the opening statement (in Case Study 1) and the final submission.\nBecause contributions were to be included in the assessment each posting was identified as\nbeing the work of a particular student. For Case Study 2, students appreciated being able\nto obtain an individual as well as a group mark. They found the transparency which the\nsoftware provided (identifying them as authors of their contributions) was valuable in this\nrespect as they could be confident that they would get credit for their own effort.\nWhilst it was apparent that a few students contributed to the debate only because they were\nbeing assessed, others contributed over and above the required number of times.\nMotivational factors, such as personal interest in the subject matter, pride in their\ncontribution to the debate, the ability of the seminar leaders to generate discussion (by\nasking thought-provoking, challenging or probing questions) and feedback from their\npeers, were influential in this respect and also affected the quality of the submissions.\nIn both case studies there were specific benefits in terms of learning. Students learned from\neach other, were motivated because input from other students prompted further research,\nand spent considerable effort in finding evidence (both print and Web-based) to support\ntheir arguments.\nAlmost all the students enjoyed having the freedom to decide when to contribute to the\ndebates, although there was less agreement on whether it was easy or difficult to organize their\ntime for regular interaction. Those who had access to a computer and modem at home (67 per\ncent in Case Study 1,49 per cent in Case Study 2) enjoyed increased flexibility over choice of\ntime and place to participate in the discussion, whilst students working from college also felt\nthere was a benefit in not being constrained by a specific two-hour timetabled class.\nFor example, one student stated:\nIt suits me as a Mum. I could put more in and research in my own time and then come in\nand put in my information when I'm free.\nFurthermore, they felt that the length of time allotted to the debates (two\/three weeks\noverall) led to the development of a more in-depth understanding of the topics.\n36\nALT-J Vb\/ume 7 Number \/\nConclusions\nThere are several issues to be considered when defining and setting up tasks for computer-\nsupported collaborative learning, including the appropriateness of the medium for the\ntask, the role of individuals, the volume of work, the time allocated for tasks or sub-tasks,\nand the assessment procedures.\nIn the case studies outlined here it is our view that the task defined in Case Study 1 was\nentirely appropriate for the medium (a similar task utilizing different software is described\nby McAteer et al. (1997)). Students were clear about the nature of the task, their role (see\nBerge (1995) for a description of the role of facilitators in computer conferences) and the\nprocedures to be followed. Some criticism was made of the fact that COW did not allow\nfor threading of messages, but this was a minor difficulty and on the whole the students\nfound the interface easy to use. In terms of the task's comparability with traditional\nseminar presentations, greater emphasis was placed on the need for students to act as\ncontributors to the debate (with this being assessed), although there was no verbal delivery\nof the paper. Even when the task is appropriate for the medium, it is important that\nimplementers get the expected workload right. In this example students were critical of the\nnumber of conferences to which they had to contribute (four, including the one they led).\nWhilst this approach exposed them to a broad range of topics it also made it difficult for\nthem to study any of the topics in sufficient depth. This will be reconsidered in future\ncourses.\nWhilst Case Study 1 provided a satisfactory outcome, Case Study 2 was on the whole less\nsuccessful. Although the nature of the task was clear, it was less appropriate for the\nsoftware environment used. The use of newsgroups was satisfactory for facilitating the\nsharing of research findings, but the task required a consensual decision and the mechan-\nism provided for sharing and agreeing the content of the final submission was rather\ncumbersome (a different piece of software might well provide the necessary tools). If this\nexercise is run again it will be necessary to revise the task, rework the assessment details\n(the length of the final submission was rather short for a group exercise) and reconsider the\nappropriateness of the software environment.\nTo summarize:\n\u2022 The task set in a CSCL environment must be appropriate for the medium. Discussion\nand debate is appropriate: attempting to arrive at a consensual view may not be, unless\nappropriate support tools can be provided.\n\u2022 Electronic conferencing systems provide an excellent mechanism for recording,\nmonitoring and assessing individual contributions to group activities.\n\u2022 Students have time to reflect on contributions to the debate, undertake further research\nand make further contributions, leading to improved quality in student learning.\n\u2022 The transparency of electronic discussion encourages participants to research topics\nthoroughly.\nIf the task and assessment are appropriate, and software provides the right support tools,\nthen the quality of the learning and the learning experience will be improved.\n37\nKathy Buckner and Kate Morss The importance of task appropriateness in computer-supported collaborative learning\nReferences\nBerge, Z.
