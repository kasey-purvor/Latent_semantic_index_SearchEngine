Res., 116, A01214, doi:10.1029\/2010JA016007.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Substorms are the fundamental global disturbance\nof the magnetospheric system. The substorm growth phase\nis usually defined as a period of 30\u201360 min of southward\noriented interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) [McPherron\net al., 1973] during which low\u2010latitude reconnection at the\ndayside magnetopause opens previously closed terrestrial\nmagnetic field lines to the solar wind. The newly opened\nmagnetic field lines are, subsequently, swept across the polar\ncaps by the solar wind flow [Dungey, 1963], leading to the\naccumulation of open magnetic flux in the magnetotail.\nThe buildup of magnetic energy in the tail cannot continue\nindefinitely, and it is thought that either a critical threshold\nwithin the magnetosphere itself is reached [e.g., Freeman and\nMorley, 2004, 2009] or there is an external trigger in the solar\nwind [e.g., Lyons et al., 1997], which initiates the onset of\nexplosive magnetic reconnection at a near\u2010Earth neutral line\nwithin the magnetotail. Tail reconnection rapidly proceeds\nonto open magnetic field lines, reclosing large amounts of\nopen magnetic flux during the substorm expansion phase,\nbefore slowing during substorm recovery [Hones, 1984].\n[3] The visible manifestation of the onset of explosive\nmagnetic reconnection in the magnetotail is the global acti-\nvation of auroral activity [Akasofu, 1964]. Typically, the\nenhanced auroral activity following substorm onset will last\nfor up to an hour, the substorm expansion phase. However,\nnot all nightside auroral brightenings are followed by the\nglobal expansion of auroral activity signifying a substorm\nexpansion phase. Akasofu [1964] noted that, on occasion, an\nauroral arc would intensify as if marking the start of substorm\nonset, but that the auroral activity would fade to background\nlevels after only a few minutes. These events were termed\npseudobreakups. It is often hard to distinguish between weak\nsubstorms and pseudobreakups, as pseudobreakups can often\nshow one or more signatures of substorm onset [McPherron\net al., 2008, and references therein]. Zhou and Tsurutani\n[2001] carried out a statistical study in which substorms,\npseudobreakups, and quiescent intervals occurring after inter-\nplanetary shocks were associated with strongly southward\nIMF, near\u2010zero IMF, and strongly northward IMF, respec-\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n3Laboratory of Planetary and Atmospheric Physics, University of\nLi\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.\nCopyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/11\/2010JA016007\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 116, A01214, doi:10.1029\/2010JA016007, 2011\nA01214 1 of 12\ntively. Kullen and Karlsson [2004] studied 3 months of data\ncontaining 419 substorm events and 330 pseudobreakups.\nThey found that large substorms most often occur when the\nIMF is strongly negative, small substorms most often occur\nwhen Bz is weakly positive or 0, and pseudobreakups most\noften occur for weakly positive Bz and very weak (below\naverage) IMF magnitudes and solar wind density and flow\nspeeds.\n[4] Previous studies [e.g., Craven and Frank, 1987;\nBrittnacher et al., 1999; Milan et al., 2003] have shown\nthat the auroral oval, in general, expands to lower latitudes\nduring the substorm growth phase before beginning to\nrapidly contract at substorm onset. The poleward edge of\nauroral oval emission is often used as a proxy for the\nlocation of the boundary between the more poleward open\nmagnetic field lines and the more equatorward closed\nmagnetic field lines, the open\u2010closed magnetic field line\nboundary (OCB) [e.g., Boakes et al., 2008, and references\ntherein]. Global hemispheric auroral imagery from orbit-\ning spacecraft, such as the Imager for Magnetopause\u2010to\u2010\nAurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) mission [Mende et\nal., 2000a], thus allows the size of the region enclosed\nby the auroral oval (the polar cap), and hence the hemi-\nspheric open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere\n(Fpc), to be estimated [e.g., Milan et al., 2003, 2007].\nSeveral studies [e.g., Milan et al., 2003, 2007, 2009a;\nCoumans et al., 2007; DeJong et al., 2007; Hubert et al.,\n2008; Boakes et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009] have\nemployed such methods to show that Fpc typically increases\nby \u223c25%\u201335% during the substorm growth phase, while the\naverage Fpc at onset is typically between 0.5 and 0.7 GWb\n(but can be as low as 0.3\u20130.45 GWb for very weak events\nand as high as 0.8\u20131.0 GWb for sawtooth events). These\nstudies also found that Fpc typically decreases by \u223c24%\u2013\n30% in the substorm expansion phase. Other studies have\nfound that Fpc can remain relatively unchanged, or even\nincrease, following substorm onset for events in which the\nlevel of dayside reconnection exceeds that on the nightside\n[e.g., Coumans et al., 2007; Milan et al., 2007].\n[5] Another signature of substorm onset is the enhance-\nment of geomagnetic activity as measured by the AL and AU\ngeomagnetic indices, defined by Davis and Sugiura [1966].\nDuring the substorm growth phase, enhanced plasma con-\nvection leads to an observed gradual increase in both the AL\nand the AU indices [McPherron, 1970]. At substorm onset\nthe disruption of the cross\u2010tail current and formation of the\nsubstorm electrojet cause a rapid increase in the strength of\nthe AL index and subsequent recovery. Weimer [1994]\ncarried out a superposed epoch analysis of the AL and AU\nindices for 55 substorm events, finding the peak in activity\nwas reached between +25 and +34 min after the time of\nsubstorm onset, with the peak in intensity, and subsequent\ndecay, increasing for more intense substorms.\n[6] One of the most common signatures used to identify\nsubstorms is the injection of energetic electrons and protons\ninto near\u2010Earth orbit [e.g., Belian et al., 1978; Baker et al.,\n1979]. While various models for the simultaneous acceler-\nation of particles of all energies have been proposed [e.g.,\nBirn et al., 1997; Sarris and Li, 2005; Liu et al., 2009;\nAsano et al., 2010; and references therein], the phenome-\nnological evolution of particle injection at substorm onset is\nwell known [e.g., McIlwain, 1974; Mauk and Meng, 1983;\nReeves et al., 1996]. A spacecraft located within the so\u2010called\ninjection region, located near midnight magnetic local times\n(MLTs) and spanning several hours of MLT, usually ob-\nserves a dispersionless enhancement of energetic electrons\nand protons of all energies. Due to gradient and curvature\ndrift, electrons subsequently drift eastward and protons\nwestward, such that spacecraft located outside of the injection\nregion will observe the energy\u2010dispersed signature of injec-\ntion. The evolution of particle injection in such a manner is\ndefined as a \u201ctypical\u201d or \u201cclassic\u201d substorm injection signa-\nture. Such injection signatures have been shown to be asso-\nciated with almost all other signatures of substorm onset [e.g.,\nArnoldy and Chan, 1969; Belian et al., 1981; Yeoman et al.,\n1994; Abel et al., 2006]. However, Boakes et al. [2009]\nshowed that not all substorms identified from global auroral\nbrightenings occur in conjunction with the expected particle\ninjection signature of substorm onset. In a study of 135 events\nthey found that 26% of events could not be associated with\nany injection activity. They also found that substorms asso-\nciated with a classic particle injection signature occur, on\naverage, at higher values of Fpc at onset than events showing\nvaried or no injection activity. In this paper we investigate this\nfinding further by carrying out a superposed epoch analysis of\nFpc, auroral intensity, IMF, and solar wind conditions, as well\nas geomagnetic activity, around the time of substorm onset,\nfor the three particle injection categories defined by Boakes et\nal. [2009].\n2. Methodology\n[7] In this study we use a subset of substorms identified\nby Frey et al. [2004] from images of the northern hemi-\nspheric auroral oval made by the far ultraviolet (FUV)\ninstrument on board the IMAGE spacecraft [Mende et al.,\n2000a, 2000b]. The FUV instrument consisted of a\nwideband imaging camera (WIC), and two Spectrographic\nImagers, SI12 and SI13. The WIC had a bandwidth of\n140\u2013180 nm, observing emissions from the N2 Lyman\u2010\nBirge\u2010Hopfield band and atomic NI lines. SI12 observed\nthe proton aurora with a pass band of 5 nm centered on the\n121.82 nm Doppler\u2010shifted Lyman a. The SI13 detector\nobserved the \u201cexcited electron aurora\u201d with a pass band\nof 5 nm centered on the 135.6 nm OI doublet. The WIC\noffered the best spatial resolution, \u223c50 km at apogee,\ncompared to \u223c100 km offered by both spectrographic\nimagers. The IMAGE spacecraft was operational from\nMay 2000 to December 2005, when the spacecraft failed.\nImages were captured at a cadence of 2 min for approxi-\nmately 10 h of every 14 h orbit. Frey et al. [2004] pri-\nmarily used WIC data, owing to its greater spatial\nresolution, to identify substorms using the following cri-\nteria: (1) a clear local brightening of the auroral oval must\nbe observed, (2) the local brightening must expand to the\npoleward boundary of the auroral oval and spread azi-\nmuthally in local time for at least 20 min, and (3) a sub-\nstorm onset was accepted as a separate substorm only if at\nleast 30 min had passed since the previous onset. When\nWIC data were absent, SI13 images were used instead.\n[8] The method of Boakes et al. [2009] is used to estimate\nFpc from WIC images of the northern polar cap. In brief,\neach auroral image is divided into 24 latitudinal profiles,\neach taken from a longitudinal swath 1 h of MLT wide. The\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n2 of 12\nlatitudinal variation of the longitudinally averaged intensity\nwithin each profile is fitted by a Gaussian plus quadratic\nfunction. Here the Gaussian is expected to fit to the latitu-\ndinal profile of the auroral oval, whereas the quadratic fits to\nany background luminosity. Extra fitting criteria are em-\nployed to account for dayglow and double Gaussian auroral\noval profiles. The OCB is then assumed to be placed pole-\nward of the center of the most poleward Gaussian fit meeting\nthe fitting criteria by an amount equal to the Gaussian full\nwidth at half\u2010maximum (FWHM). Boakes et al. [2008]\nstudied the latitudinal difference between the OCB esti-\nmated in this manner and that estimated from particle pre-\ncipitation measurements from the DMSP spacecraft (thought\nto provide the most direct and precise proxy for the OCB but\nunable to provide a global proxy owing to its limited spatial\nresolution). They found systematic offsets between the two\nmethods (see their Figure 5) that are applied to \u201ccorrect\u201d the\nWIC OCB estimates. A Fourier expansion is applied to the\nestimates of OCB latitude, returning a final estimation of\nthe OCB at 48 evenly spaced MLTs. Fpc is determined by\nnumerically integrating the radial component of Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field at auroral heights along the 48 latitudinal\nmeridians, each a half\u2010hour of MLT in width, in steps of 0.5\u00b0\nof latitude from the magnetic pole to the latitude of the OCB.\nBoakes et al. [2009] usedWIC data from December 2000 and\nJanuary and December 2001 and 2002 to estimate Fpc. Data\nfrom December and January months only are used, as the\nincreasing levels of dayglow for other months cause\nincreased uncertainty in identifying the boundaries.\n[9] We classify all substorm onsets identified by Frey et\nal. [2004] in the months of December 2000\u20132002 and\nJanuary 2001\u20132002 into three categories based on their\nparticle injection signatures, as defined by Boakes et al.\n[2009]. Low\u2010energy particle summary plots provided by\nmeasurements from the Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer\n(SOPA) instruments on board the Los Alamos National\nLaboratory (LANL) spacecraft [Belian et al., 1992] are used\nto classify the substorms. The LANL spacecraft are located at\ngeosynchronous orbit, with data from three to four spacecraft\ntypically received simultaneously. Substorms are divided\ninto one of three categories, similar to the categories defined\nby Abel et al. [2006] (examples of which are shown therein):\n(1) a classical substorm injection signature, (2) unclear\nactivity, and (3) no activity. Substorms falling into category 1\nwill normally have a clear signature of the simultaneous\ninjection (low dispersion or dispersionless injections) of\nenergetic particles of all energies (electrons were measured in\nsix energy channels between 50 and 500 keV, and protons\nwere measured in five energy channels between 50 and\n400 keV by the LANL spacecraft) in the midnight sector,\nfollowed by the energy\u2010dispersed signature of simultaneous\ninjection seen by satellites (typically two or more) located at\nearlier and later MLTs. Events when no satellite data are\navailable in the midnight sector but a dispersed signature is\nseen by at least three other satellites, consistent with gradient\u2010\ncurvature drift of particles from a dispersionless enhancement\nnear midnight, are also included in this category. Category 2\ncovers all other energetic particle fluctuations not falling\nwithin category 1. Category 3 events show no fluctuations in\nany of the LANL spacecraft. To be included in this category,\ndata must be available in the midnight sector. Both electron\nand proton data are used in the classification process. Of the\n451 substorms in the Frey onset list for themonths used in this\nstudy, we are able to classify 306 events into the three LANL\ncategories (that is, 145 onsets are rejected owing to a lack\nof available LANL spacecraft data), finding relatively even\nnumbers in each: 100 (33%) in category 1, 114 (37%) in\ncategory 2, and 92 (30%) in category 3.\n[10] Progressing through the plots in Figure 1, we present\na superposed epoch analysis of Fpc (Figure 1a), the maximum\nnightside auroral intensity (I) (Figure 1b), IMF components\nBx, By, andBz, and their absolute magnitudes (Figures 1c\u20131h),\nthe solar wind proton density, dynamic pressure, and flow\nspeed (Figures 1i\u20131k), the SYM\u2010H index (Figure 1l), the\nAkasofu \" parameter, given by equation (1) here (Figure 1m),\nand finally, the AU and AL geomagnetic indices (Figure 1n).\nCategory 1 events are shown by the green line, category 2 by\nthe red line, and category 3 by the blue line. The maximum\nnightside auroral intensity is taken to be the maximum count\nrate found between 18 and 6 MLT, between 50\u00b0 and 90\u00b0\nmagnetic latitude, and between 0 and 4000 counts in the\nWIC data. We find that including counts above a threshold\nof 4000 can introduce large spikes in the superposed epoch\ntraces of mean intensity owing to some very high count\nrates originating from nonauroral sources in a limited number\nof images (e.g., from instrumental errors). A threshold of\n4000 counts produces a very good match between the mean\nintensity plot in Figure 1b and a similar plot produced using\nthe median values of intensity in the binning process. Cor-\nrected counts are used throughout this study, where correc-\ntions for flatfield, gain of the MCP, etc., have been applied so\nthat 1 Rayleigh of emission always produces the same\nnumber of counts anywhere in the CCD. One\u2010minute\u2010\nresolution solar wind and IMF data are provided by the\nOMNI Definitive, 1 AU 1 min IMF and Plasma database,\ncourtesy of CDAWeb. Plasma and magnetic field data from\nthe ACE [McComas et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1998; Stone et\nal., 1998], Wind [Lepping et al., 1995; Ogilvie et al., 1995;\nFranz et al., 2001], and Geotail [Nishida et al., 1992; Frank\net al., 1994; Kokubun et al., 1994] spacecraft were used to\nproduce averaged 1 min resolution plasma and IMF data\nsets shifted to Earth\u2019s bow shock nose using a minimal\nvariance technique [seeWeimer et al., 2003]. All solar wind\ndata used in this paper are in GSM coordinates. Ground\nmagnetometers provide 1 min resolution AL, AU, and\nSYM\u2010H indices. The Akasofu \" parameter is an empirically\ndetermined fraction of the solar wind Poynting flux through\nthe dayside magnetopause [Perreault and Akasofu, 1978]\nand is thus a measure of the solar wind energy input into the\nmagnetosphere due to dayside reconnection. Here we define\nthe \" parameter as\n\" \u00bc VxB\n2\n\u00020\nsin4 \u0003=2\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere B is the total IMF strength (B =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nB2x \u00fe B2y \u00fe B2z\nq\n), Vx is\nthe X component of the solar wind flow speed, \u0003 is the IMF\nclock angle (\u0003 = arctan(jByj\/Bz)), and m0 is the permeability\nof free space. This has a functional form similar to that of\nequations used to estimate the dayside reconnection rate [e.g.,\nMilan et al., 2008], and thus its magnitude also gives an\nindication of the level of dayside reconnection. Here we have\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n3 of 12\nleft out the length constant l0, such that \" has units of power\nper unit area.\n[11] A superposed epoch time series of each parameter\nrelative to the time of substorm onset (shown by the bold\nvertical line at t = 0 in Figures 1a\u20131n; dashed vertical lines\nrepresent hours from onset) is produced using the following\nprocedure: For each Frey onset within the relevant LANL\ncategory we find all values of the relevant parameter that lie\nwithin \u00b15 h of the onset time. The data are then placed in\nbins of 13 min, such that the bin centered on substorm onset\ncontains all values within \u00b16 min of the onset time. The\nmean of all values in each 13 min bin and across all sub-\nstorms within the relevant category is then taken. We find\nthat using the medians in the binning process does not affect\nany of the superposed traces significantly, but the means\nprovide slightly smother variations in which the main trends\nare easier to discern. Also overplotted in each panel is a\ncontrol line (gray) representing the average conditions and\nvariations for the whole period of study, not keyed to sub-\nstorm onset. This is calculated by adding one IMAGE\norbital period (14.2 h) to every LANL category onset epoch,\na total of 306 events, before carrying out the same binning\nprocedure as before keyed to this new shifted time for all\n306 epochs. We shift the onset times by one IMAGE orbit\nso as to introduce no biases in the viewing angle of the WIC\ndetector. We note that only two of the shifted control line\nepochs fall within 30 min of a substorm listed by Frey et al.\n[2004], and only 33 events (11%) fall within 1 h of a Frey\net al. onset, giving us confidence that the control lines are\nnot adversely effected by injection events themselves. Using\nany smoothing methodology produces similar magnitude\ncontrol lines but eliminates the average control line fluc-\ntuations used to analyze the significance of fluctuations in\nthe LANL category superposed traces.

Observations\n[12] Initial inspection of Figure 1 shows that category 1\nand 2 events occur with similar magnitudes and trends in\nmany of the parameters, while, in contrast, category 3 events\nappear to bemuchweaker events in all parameters. Therefore,\nwe first summarize and compare the trends and variations\nseen in category 1 and 2 events in section 3.1 before addressing\nthe much weaker category 3 events in section 3.2.\n3.1. Overview of Category 1 and 2 Events\n3.1.1. Open Magnetic Flux and Auroral Intensity\n[13] The variation of Fpc for categories 1 and 2 is pre-\nsented by the green and red lines, respectively, in Figure 1a.\nThe main characteristic of the variation in Fpc for both cate-\ngories is an increase prior to onset, the growth phase, and\na decrease after onset, the expansion phase. Boakes et al.\n[2009] demonstrated that, on average, category 1 events\noccur with higher values of Fpc at onset compared to either\ncategory 2 or 3 events. This is confirmed in Figure 1a, with\nthe category 1 Fpc rising to a value of 0.64 GWb at the onset\ntime. Fpc varies between 0.46 and 0.64 GWb for the entire\nperiod of study, consistent with values found in previous\nstudies [e.g., Coumans et al., 2007; DeJong et al., 2007;\nMilan et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009]. Prior to \u221252 min, Fpc\nremains relatively steady, fluctuating between 0.52 and\n0.57 GWb, values slightly higher than the mean of the control\nline flux (0.51 GWb), representing the average conditions\nfor all events. A rapid increase in Fpc is then seen, with Fpc\nrising from a value of 0.53 GWb at \u221252 min to a value of\n0.64 GWb at onset, a percentage increase of \u223c21%, similar\nto the percentage increase typically found for substorms [e.g.,\nCoumans et al., 2007]. Following onset, Fpc begins to decline\nimmediately, until a value of 0.51GWb is reached at +78min,\na percentage decrease of \u223c20%, consistent with the typical\nFpc decrease observed for both isolated substorms and saw-\ntooth events [e.g., DeJong et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009].\nThereafter, Fpc fluctuates at values similar to the control line\nflux (gray). The fluctuations in Fpc both prior to the Fpc\ngrowth phase and following the expansion phase are similar\nin size to the fluctuations seen in the control line, suggesting\nthat they are insignificant.\n[14] From the start of the period of study to approximately\n\u2212120 min, category 2 Fpc values fluctuate between 0.46 and\n0.56 GWb, similar to the control line flux. At approximately\n\u2212120 min, Fpc begins to increase gradually, the rate of\nincrease accelerating at \u221291 min, which we take to be the\nbeginning of the Fpc growth phase for category 2 events.\nThis growth phase is approximately 30 min longer than the\nFpc growth phase seen for category 1 events and increases\nFpc from a value of 0.50 GWb at \u221291 min to a value of\n0.61 GWb at onset, an increase of 22%, similar to the\nincrease for category 1 and typical of substorms. Follow-\ning onset the decrease in Fpc is much less pronounced but\nmore prolonged than for category 1, lasting for approxi-\nmately 90 min and reducing Fpc by \u223c0.045 GWb. That is,\nFpc decreases by only 7% in the expansion phase. Following\nthe end of the expansion phase Fpc continues to fluctuate\nbetween 0.55 and 0.60 GWb for the remainder of the\nperiod, comfortably above the control line flux and Fpc\nprior to substorm onset. A smaller secondary peak in Fpc\nappears at approximately \u22123 h; this is discussed more fully\nin section 4.3.\n[15] The maximum nightside auroral intensity (I) is\npresented in Figure 1b. Prior to substorm onset both the\ncategory 1 (green trace) and the category 2 (red trace) I show\nlittle variation and fluctuate at values only slightly elevated\nfrom the control line. At onset both the category 1 and the\ncategory 2 I increase rapidly. Similar to the behavior of the\ncategory 1 Fpc, after the peak has been reached, the category 1\nI decreases rapidly, returning to control line values at approx-\nimately +120 min and thereafter remaining relatively steady\nfor the remainder of the period of study. As with the cate-\ngory 2 Fpc, the category 2 I has a more prolonged and less\nrapid decline, halting at approximately +158 min, where-\nafter I remains slightly elevated from the category 1 and\ncontrol line trace for the remainder of the period.\n3.1.2. Solar Wind and Interplanetary Magnetic Field\nConditions\n[16] Category 1 and 2 IMF and solar wind conditions\nare represented by the green and red lines, respectively, in\nFigures 1c to 1h. From the beginning of the period of study\nto approximately \u2212130 min, the category 1 superposed Bz\n(green trace, Figure 1c) fluctuates between \u22120.3 and \u22120.9 nT,\nsimilar to the values of the control line (gray trace), which has\na mean of 0.0 nT. This is followed by a large and rapid\nincrease in the negative magnitude of Bz, with \u22123.2 nT being\nreached at \u221226 min. Subsequently, Bz sharply turns toward\nless negative magnitudes, a value of \u22120.8 nT being reached at\napproximately +60 min. Thereafter Bz slowly progresses\ntoward less negative values but is always more negative than\nthe control line.\n[17] The category 2 superposed Bz is represented by the\nred trace in Figure 1c. From the start of the period to\napproximately \u2212200 min the category 2 Bz fluctuates at\nvalues similar to that for category 1 before moving to\nslightly positive values between \u2212180 and \u2212120 min. The\nBz begins to increase in negative magnitude at the same\ntime that the negative excursion is seen in category 1 events,\nthe rate of change increasing rapidly at \u221278 min. The most\nnegative value, about \u22121.9 nT, is reached at \u221213 min,\napproximately 10min later than for category 1 events. Similar\nto the trends seen in Fpc and I, the recovery of Bz toward\ncontrol line values is much less rapid than for category 1\nevents, continuing for up to 3 h after onset.\n[18] Figure 1d presents the absolute magnitude of Bz.\nCategory 1 events fluctuate around the control line values\nfor the entire period of study, except for a period of \u223c2 h\nstarting \u223c1 h prior to onset, corresponding to the large neg-\native excursion seen in Bz in Figure 1c. In general, the cate-\ngory 2 jBzj is elevated from both category 1 and the control\nlines for the entire period of study. By, Bx, and their absolute\nmagnitudes are presented in Figures 1e\u20131h. By (Figure 1e) is\nslightly elevated from the control line for both categories,\nwhile the category 2 jByj (Figure 1f) is significantly elevated\nfrom both the control line and category 1. Both Bx and jBxj for\ncategory 1 (Figures 1g and 1h) fluctuate at values similar to\nthose of the control line, while the jBxj for category 2 events is\nelevated from that of category 1 and the control line, with the\ncategory 2 Bx fluctuating at negative values. Figures 1i\u20131k\npresent the superposed solar wind proton density, dynamic\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n5 of 12\npressure, and Vx component of the solar wind flow speed,\nrespectively. Category 2 events show elevated magnitudes of\ndensity and pressure, compared to the control lines or cate-\ngory 1, while category 1 events occur at an elevated flow\nspeed. The superposed IMF and solar wind conditions sug-\ngest that while category 1 events occur at average IMF and\nsolar wind conditions, category 2 events occur during more\nsustained active conditions.\n[19] Figure 1m presents the superposed \" parameter, a\nproxy for the dayside reconnection rate. As expected from\nthe form of equation (1), category 1 \" closely anticorrelates\nwith the variations of the Bz component of the IMF\n(Figure 1c), with a correlation coefficient of \u22120.9. From the\nstart of the period of study to approximately \u2212130 min, \"\nfluctuates around the control line values before rapidly\nincreasing in conjunction with the large negative excursion\nof Bz. A maximum value is reached at \u221226 min, the same\ntime that Bz reaches its most negative value. Subsequently, \"\ndrops rapidly until +91 min, after which it remains close to\nthe control line.\n[20] As for category 1 events, category 2 events also show\na close anticorrelation between IMF Bz and \", also with a\ncorrelation coefficient of \u22120.9. However, the category 2 \" is\nelevated from the control line and category 1 \" for the entire\nperiod of study. At the beginning of the period of study \" is\nsignificantly elevated from the control line and category 1\nvalues, dropping to control line fluxes at approximately\n\u2212117 min. In conjunction with the negative excursion seen\nin the category 2 Bz, \" then shows a rapid increase in\nmagnitude. A peak is reached at \u221213 min, the same time as\nthe negative peak in Bz. As with Bz, \" subsequently declines\nslowly, always remaining elevated from the control line\nand category 1 events, for the remainder of the period. The\nelevated magnitudes of \" for category 2 events following\nonset suggest that the events of this category are highly\ninfluenced by continued dayside reconnection throughout\ntheir expansion phases, resulting in the slower decline of\nFpc and I shown in Figures 1a and 1b.\n[21] Here we note that despite the higher level of \", and\ninferred increase in the addition of open magnetic flux to the\nmagnetosphere through dayside reconnection, for category 2\nevents, the peak of the category 1 Fpc reaches a slightly higher\nvalue than that for category 2. This is evidently a result of\nthe differences between categories seen in the starting level of\nFpc at the beginning of the study period. At \u2212300 min the Fpc\nof category 1 events is \u223c0.1 GWb higher than that for cate-\ngory 2. The category 1 Fpc and \" thereafter remain relatively\nsteady until approximately \u2212130 min, whereafter they rise in\nconjunction with an increase in the negative magnitude of the\nIMF Bz. In contrast, the elevated magnitude of the category 2\n\" at the beginning of the period causes an increase in category\n2 Fpc to values greater than that for category 1. As the IMF Bz\ncomponent becomes positive at between \u2212180 and \u2212120 min,\nthis is followed by a decrease in the category 2 Fpc back to\na level below that of category 1. Presumably, this is a result\nof a drop in the rate of creation of open magnetic flux at the\ndayside magnetopause, as indicated by the reduction in \", and\nthe continued closure of flux on the nightside by reconnection\nat a distant neutral line [Dungey, 1963] and\/or substorms (see\nsection 4.3). As the IMF Bz component subsequently turns\nsouthward at the beginning of the substorm growth phase, \"\nincreases and Fpc begins to rise. The observation that the\ncategory 2 Fpc does not rise as sharply as the category 1 Fpc,\ndespite its higher level of dayside reconnection (\"), may\nsuggest that ongoing closure of flux on the nightside of the\nmagnetosphere (nonsubstorm activity) continues at a higher\nlevel during the more active periods of category 2 events,\ncompared to category 1.\n3.1.3. Geomagnetic Activity\n[22] The superposed geomagnetic indices, SYM\u2010H, AU,\nand AL, are presented in Figures 1l and 1n, respectively. The\ncategory 1 SYM\u2010H (green trace) is found at higher magni-\ntudes than that for category 2 or the control line for the entire\nperiod of study. The SYM\u2010H gradually increases in negative\nmagnitude from the beginning of the period of study to\napproximately \u221278 min, where a negative bay begins to form.\nThe peak magnitude is reached at the onset time, before\ngradually declining back to nominal levels (for category 1).\nThe category 2 SYM\u2010H fluctuates at lower magnitudes than\nthat for category 1 and the control line, gradually increasing in\nmagnitude over the entire period of study. The negative\nenhancement of the SYM\u2010H index for substorm events with\nlarger values of Fpc (category 1) is consistent with results\nof previous superposed studies [Milan et al., 2008, 2009a,\n2009b; Huang et al., 2009].\n[23] The category 1 AL and AU indices (Figure 1n, green\ntrace) show the expected bays associated with the onset of\nsubstorms. As with the SYM\u2010H index, both the AL and the\nAU magnitudes fluctuate at values greater than the control\nlines for the entire period of study. The peaks in AL and AU\nare reached at +26 min. The category 2 AL and AU also\nshow the expected bay signature of substorms, although the\npeak magnitudes are reached at the slightly later times of\n+52 and +65 min and are slightly lower. The recovery of\ncategory 2 AL and AU towards control line values after\nonset occurs more gradually over a longer time period (\u223c3 h)\nthan for category 1 events, similar to Fpc, I, Bz, and \". The\npeak in the category 1 AL and AU at +26 min is consistent\nwith the range of 25 to 34 min (peak times for substorms\nwith peak AL magnitudes between 600 and 1600 nT and\nbetween 400 and 600 nT, respectively) found by Weimer\n[1994]. In contrast, the category 2 AU and AL magnitudes\npeak considerably later but may be consistent with the finding\nthat the lower the magnitude of the substorm bay, the longer it\ntakes for the peak to be reached.\n3.2. Category 3 Events\n[24] The results of Boakes et al. [2009] showed that cat-\negory 3 events occur, on average, at lower values of Fpc\nat onset than either category 1 or category 2 events. This is\nconfirmed by the blue trace in Figure 1a, with an Fpc of\n\u223c0.49 GWb reached at the onset time. This is below the\nvalue of the control line flux at this time and at the lower\nend of Fpc onset values found in previous studies. Fpc does\nnot peak at onset, instead rising slowly from approxi-\nmately \u2212169 min until a peak of 0.51 GWb is reached at\n+39 min. For the majority of the period Fpc remains below\nthe control line flux. The maximum nightside auroral inten-\nsity (Figure 1b, blue trace) also remains below the control line\nfor the majority of the 10 h of study, rising above the control\nline for a period of \u223c1 h starting around the onset time. The\nIMF Bz component (Figure 1c) and jBzj (Figure 1d) fluctuate\nat values lower than or comparable to those of the control\nlines. The By (Figure 1e) and jByj (Figure 1f) components of\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n6 of 12\nthe IMF are also found at smaller magnitudes than the control\nlines and other categories. The By component is shifted\ntoward negative values, fluctuating between approximately\n\u22121.6 and \u22120.8 nT for the entire period, suggesting that cate-\ngory 3 events occur during negative By conditions. The Bx\ncomponent (Figure 1g) is found at slightly more positive\nvalues than the control line, as may be expected to accompany\na negative By shift due to anticorrelation between Bx and By in\nthe Parker spiral. This is almost the opposite of what is seen\nfor category 2 events, suggesting that category 2 and 3 events\noccur in different sectors of the Parker spiral (i.e., above or\nbelow the heliospheric current sheet). The category 3 solar\nwind proton density (Figure 1i), pressure (Figure 1j), and\nflow speed (Figure 1k) are all significantly reduced compared\nto those for category 1 and 2 events and the average control\nlines. Similarly the SYM\u2010H, AL, and AU indices also fluc-\ntuate at values below those of the control lines and are\nsignificantly reduced in magnitude compared to those of\ncategory 1 and 2 events, suggesting that category 3 events\noccur during very quiet geomagnetic conditions. Minimal\ndisturbances are seen in the AL and AU indices at the time of\nonset for category 3 events. The substorms used in this\npaper are from the Northern Hemisphere winter solstice.\nDuring this time the LANL spacecraft can be displaced\nsignificantly from the magnetic equator such that any\nspacecraft with a significant displacement may be located\noutside of the region of any weak particle enhancements.\nWe investigated this displacement, to determine whether\nthe lack of particle enhancement for any category 3 events\ncould be explained in this manner, and found seven cate-\ngory 3 events for which the LANL spacecraft located near\nmidnight were found to be significantly displaced from the\nequator and thus may miss weak injections. However, the\nselection criterion for categorization requires that data from\nat least three LANL spacecraft, well spread inMLT, must be\navailable. We find that the spacecraft located at earlier and\nlater MLTs for the seven events mentioned are found very\nclose to the magnetic equator and therefore may be expected\nto see the drift signature of even weak substorm injections.\nThus, the lack of injection signature for category 3 events\ncannot be explained by spacecraft location, and since we\nfind no biases in LANL spacecraft location (in MLT or\nmagnetic latitude) between categories, we conclude that\nspacecraft location does not define the differences seen\nbetween them.\n4. Summary and Discussion\n[25] To have confidence in any conclusions drawn from\nthis study it is important to discuss the statistical significance\nof the trends and variations seen in the superposed plots. The\nstandard errors of all parameters, and for all categories, in\nFigure 1 are comparable in size to the smallest of the fluc-\ntuations seen in any of the parameters, and much smaller than\nany significant fluctuations considered. A very small number\nof events in each category are found to occur during stronger\nthan average solar wind conditions. However, removing these\nevents from the analysis reveals that they do not affect the\nvariations presented in Figure 1. We conclude that the var-\niations and trends seen are true representations of the differing\nLANL categories.\n4.1. Summary of Trends and Variations\n[26] Here let us summarize the main findings of section 3\nbefore discussing the role of solar wind triggering (section 4.2),\nsubstorm periodicity (section 4.3), and the level of solar wind\ndriving (section 4.4) in defining the properties of the LANL\ncategories. Category 1 events (represented by green traces in\nFigure 1) are defined by their \u201cclassical\u201d particle injection\nsignatures and show all the expected signatures of classically\ndefined substorms in all parameters. This includes clear\nsubstorm growth and expansion phases in Fpc (Figure 1a) and\nAL and AU indices (Figure 1n), a rapid brightening of the\nnightside auroral intensity at substorm onset (Figure 1b), and\na classic substorm growth phase in IMF Bz (i.e., strong and\nsouthward IMF for up to an hour prior to onset; Figure 1c).\nThey are the largest andmost energetic of the three categories,\nwith the largest magnitudes reached in Fpc, I, and geomag-\nnetic indices; Figures 1l and 1n). Fpc increases by \u223c21% in\nthe Fpc growth phase and decreases by \u223c20% following\nonset, consistent with the values found in previous studies\nof \u201cclassical\u201d substorm or sawtooth events [e.g., Caan et al.,\n1978; McPherron and Hsu, 2002; Huang et al., 2009]. They\noccur in periods of enhanced geomagnetic activity (AL, AU,\nand SYM\u2010H; Figures 1l and 1n) but average IMF and solar\nwind conditions (IMFBz,By,Bx, proton density, and pressure;\nFigures 1c\u20131h), although with slightly elevated solar wind\nflow speeds (Figure 1k).\n[27] Category 2 events are defined as events that show\nany energetic particle enhancements at geosynchronous\norbit that do not follow the classical definition of substorm\ninjections and are represented by the red traces in Figure 1.\nCategory 2 events show several characteristics of substorm\nonset, including a southward turning of the IMFBz (Figure 1c),\nan \u223c22% increase in the Fpc growth phase (Figure 1a), geo-\nmagnetic bays in AL and AU indices (Figure 1n) and a rapid\nbrightening of the nightside auroral oval (Figure 1b). They\ngenerally occur during periods of enhanced IMF and solar\nwind conditions (proton density, pressure, and IMF mag-\nnitudes; Figures 1i, 1j, and 1c\u20131h, respectively) but lower\ngeomagnetic activity (Figures 1l and 1n). The defining\ncharacteristic of category 2 events is the continued elevation of\nparameters following onset, for example, in Fpc (Figure 1a),\nI (Figure 1b), AL and AU indices (Figure 1n), and \"\n(Figure 1m).\n[28] Category 3 events are defined by their lack of particle\ninjection signatures and are represented by the blue traces in\nFigure 1. Category 3 events do not show typical substorm\ngrowth and expansion phases in any of the parameters\nstudied. Fpc rises slowly from well before the onset time and\ncontinues to do so up to +50 min after onset (Figure 1a),\nremaining below the control line flux for the majority of the\nperiod of study. There is no large southward turning of\nthe IMF Bz indicative of substorm growth phases. A small\nincrease, and subsequent slow decline, is seen in the max-\nimum nightside auroral intensity (Figure 1b). This is evi-\ndently the auroral brightening indentified as substorm onset.\nVery small scale geomagnetic disturbances are also seen in\nAL (<100 nT) and AU (<50 nT) indices (Figure 1n),\nalthough these are below the average activity as represented\nby the control lines (gray). Pseudobreakups are known to\nbe associated with small geomagnetic bays, less than 100 nT\n[e.g., Koskinen et al., 1993], suggesting that pseudobreakups\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n7 of 12\nmay be included, along with weak substorms, in this cate-\ngory. They also occur during quiet geomagnetic conditions\n(AL, AU, and SYM\u2010H; Figures 1l and 1n), weak solar wind\nflow (Figures 1c\u20131k), and weakly negative or positive IMF\nBz, consistent with weak substorm events [e.g., Zhou and\nTsurutani, 2001; Kullen and Karlsson, 2004]. The average\nIMF By component (Figure 1e) is shifted toward negative\nvalues, which is unexpected. The negative By is accompanied\nby a positive Bx, as may be expected from the anticorrelation\nof Bx and By in the Parker spiral. This is opposite to what\nis seen for category 2 events, suggesting that category 2 and\n3 events occur when Earth is subject to different sectors of\nthe Parker spiral (above or below the heliospheric current\nsheet). Investigation of the By distributions for the 5 months\nof data used in this study reveals that, for all months bar one,\nBy is relatively evenly distributed around 0 nT. All distribu-\ntions except that of January 2002 having absolute means of\n<0.61 nT. The distribution of By in the month of January\n2002, however, exhibits a significant negative peak, shifting\nthe mean to negative values (\u22121.12 nT). Category 1 and\n2 events are relatively evenly spread throughout the 5 months\nused in this study. However, we find that 38% (35 events) of\ncategory 3 onsets occur during the negative By month of\nJanuary 2002. This is significantly greater than the percentage\nwe would expect from the null hypothesis that By has no\neffect on category 3 events (in which case we would expect\nthe category 3 substorms to be evenly spread throughout the\n5 months such that 20% of the events would be found in\nJanuary 2002), but we cannot think of any reason why weak\nsubstorms should be associated with negative By, and the bias\nseen may be a result of a bias in the data set used in this study,\nand not a characteristic of substorm events showing no par-\nticle injection signatures. The real association for category 3\nevents may be periods in which jByj is elevated compared to\njBzj, such that the category 3 IMF clock angle is closer to 90\u00b0,\ncontributing to the much weaker solar wind input for these\nevents compared to category 1 and 2 events. Indeed, the mean\nof the category 3 jByj component in the hour prior to onset is\nelevated from the mean of the category 3 jBzj component by\n\u223c1.9 nT, compared to an elevation of 1.6 nT for category 2\nevents and \u223c0.4 nT for category 1 events.\n4.2. Solar Wind Triggering\n[29] The large decrease in the negative magnitude of the\ncategory 1 Bz component in the half\u2010hour preceding sub-\nstorm onset may lead some observers to suggest that these\nevents could be triggered by a northward turning of the IMF.\nConversely, the more gradual change in Bz for category 2\nevents may lead some to suggest that these events are non-\ntriggered events. Morley and Freeman [2007] developed an\nautomated technique to identify northward triggers using the\nquantitative rules defined by Lyons et al. [1997] (see Morley\nand Freeman [2007] for the list of criteria used in identifying\na northward turning). Using a similar method, we find that\n44% of category 1 events, 29% of category 2 events, and 17%\nof category 3 events can be associated with a northward\nturning. If northward turnings do trigger events in our data\nset, it is clear that category 1 does not hold exclusivity on\nthese events. It is more likely that the increased number of\n\u201ctriggered\u201d events in this category and the large northward\nturning seen in the superposed trace of Bz are a consequence\nof the form of the growth phase and solar wind driving (see\nsection 4.4) of these events, rather than an indication that they\nare triggered. That is, substorms require a period of southward\nIMF prior to onset (the substorm growth phase), seen as a\nlarge negative excursion in the superposed Bz of category 1\nand 2 events. Following onset there is no requirement that the\nIMF be southward, such that the category 1 superposed Bz\nrapidly returns to fluctuating around its average value of\n\u223c0 nT. However, a key characteristic of category 2 events\nappears to be the continuation of southward IMF into the\nexpansion phase of these events (see below), resulting in a\nslower decline of Bz back to the average values [see also\nFreeman and Morley, 2009]. Coumans et al. [2007] sug-\ngested that northward triggered events occur at lower values\nof Fpc than nontriggered events such that, if category 1 events\nwere triggered by the solar wind, they would occur at lower\nvalues of Fpc than category 2 events, which is the opposite of\nwhat is seen in the present study.\n4.3. Substorm Periodicity\n[30] Initial inspection of Figure 1a suggests that a sec-\nondary peak is reached in the category 2 Fpc at approxi-\nmately \u22123 h, with smaller fluctuations occurring after onset\nat approximately +2, +3, and +4 h. Borovsky et al. [1993]\nstudied the waiting time between substorms identified from\nparticle injection events. They found an average waiting time\nof \u223c2.75 h for substorms occurring cyclically and a \u201crandom\u201d\nwaiting time of \u223c5 h for events occurring outside of these\nintervals. An interesting question that then arises is whether\ncategory 2 events are periodic events, occurring with a waiting\ntime similar to the mean waiting time found between periodic\nsubstorms, and whether category 1 events are more isolated,\noccurring with a waiting timemore similar to the waiting time\nfound between isolated \u201crandom\u201d substorm events. Using\nthe Frey list of substorm onsets, we find that there is little\ndifference between the periodicity of events between cate-\ngories. In fact, only \u223c50% of the onsets in either category 1 or\ncategory 2 is found to have another substorm within +5 or\n\u22125 h, decreasing to 36% for category 3. We conclude that\nthere is no difference in the substorm periodicity for category\n1 and 2 events. By visual inspection of the LANL data, we\nalso find fewer than five events in any one category that fall\nduring possible sawtooth periods, and hence we may also\ndraw the conclusion that sawtooth events do not define any of\nthe three categories. Similarly, by visual inspection of the\nFUV auroral images, we also find that Poleward Boundary\nIntensifications, transient intensifications observed at the\npoleward edge of the auroral oval [e.g., Lyons et al., 2002;\nZesta et al., 2002], do not determine the properties of the\nLANL categories.\n4.4. Solar Wind Driving\n[31] Wehave shown that substormperiodicity and triggering\ndo not define the trends and variations shown in Figure 1.\nHowever, the superposed epoch traces of each parameter\nappear to be well ordered by the magnitude of the dayside\nreconnection rate, as inferred from the Akasofu \" parameter\n(Figure 1m).\n[32] As already discussed, the trends and variations shown\nin Figure 1 suggest that category 1 events (green lines)\nfollow the expected evolution of classically defined sub-\nstorms. That is, the substorm growth phase is defined by a\nsouthward turning of the IMF Bz component (Figure 1c).\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n8 of 12\nThis allows magnetic reconnection to occur at the low\u2010\nlatitude dayside magnetopause, seen as a rapid increase in the\nmagnitude of the dayside reconnection rate (\" Figure 1m).\nThe enhanced dayside reconnection opens previously closed\nterrestrial magnetic flux to the polar caps, seen as a rapid\nincrease in Fpc (Figure 1a). Following the substorm growth\nphase the IMF is no longer required to be southward and Bz\nbegins to recover and fluctuate around nominal values. The\nonset of explosive reconnection in the magnetotail at sub-\nstorm onset results in the rapid closure of open magnetic\nflux. Combined with the return of the dayside reconnection\nrate to lower magnitudes, this results in a rapid decrease in the\ntotal open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere (Fpc;\nFigure 1a). The defining characteristic of category 2 events\n(red lines; Figure 1), however, is the continued elevated\nmagnitudes of dayside reconnection following substorm\nonset (Figure 1m). That is, dayside reconnection continues\nto add open magnetic flux to the polar cap at an elevated\nrate, balancing the flux closed by nightside reconnection and\nresulting in only a 7% decrease in Fpc (Figure 1a). The con-\ntinued driving of the magnetosphere by dayside reconnection\nfor these events is also evident in the slower decline of auroral\nintensity and geomagnetic activity back to nominal levels. At\nthe other end of the spectrum, category 3 events occur during\nvery weak conditions in all parameters. The \" parameter (blue\ntrace; Figure 1m) indicates that very little dayside reconnec-\ntion is ongoing, such that we may expect even a relatively\nsmall substorm to decrease Fpc, which is not seen. This may\nsuggest that nightside reconnection does not progress to open\nmagnetic field lines for this category.\n[33] The \" parameter is a function of the solar wind flow\nspeed (Vx), IMF clock angle, and absolute magnitude of the\nIMF. The variation of the \" parameter closely mirrors that of\nthe IMF Bz component for both category 1 and category 2,\nsuggesting that the IMF Bz is highly influential on the level\nof dayside reconnection for both events. However, in the hour\nprior to onset the mean of the category 2 jByj (5.11 nT) is\nsignificantly elevated from that of the jBzj (3.49 nT), while for\ncategory 1 events the absolute magnitudes are very similar\n(3.84 nT for By and 3.48 nT for Bz). While the IMF Bz com-\nponent appears to be the controlling factor in the level of\ndayside driving for category 1 events, the By component of\nthe field appears to play a more significant role for category 2.\n[34] The LANL energetic particle data show that many\ncategory 2 events occur during periods of very active and\ncomplicated energetic particle fluctuations. This includes\nenhancements related to solar wind pressure pulses [e.g.,\nLee et al., 2005], drift echoes from previous substorms, and\nlarge flux dropouts as the spacecraft leave the plasma sheet.\nThis increased magnetospheric activity is likely a result of\nthe more active solar wind conditions and the elevated\nmagnitude and continuation of dayside solar wind magneto-\nspheric driving seen for these events, compared to other\ncategories.Milan et al. [2006] carried out a multi\u2010instrument\nstudy of a substorm interval occurring during a period of\ncontinued southward IMF and, hence, inferred continuous\ndayside driving. They found that following the second sub-\nstorm event in their study, the Fpc remained elevated for the\nremainder of the substorm interval and that the maximum\nnightside auroral intensity, after showing a rapid brightening\naround the onset time, declined slowly over the next 2.5 h,\nmuch like that seen for category 2. Using magnetic field data\nfrom spacecraft located in the magnetotail, the authors sug-\ngest that the tail dynamics during the substorm is strongly\ndriven by the ongoing dayside creation of openmagnetic flux.\nWe suggest that category 2 events are similar to the event\nin this study in that the tail dynamics and magnetospheric\nactivity are greatly influenced not only by the continued\ncreation of open magnetic flux on the dayside during the\nsubstorm expansion phase, but also by the elevated magni-\ntude of the dayside reconnection rate (\") during their slightly\nprolonged growth phase, compared to other categories. This\nalso suggests that the directly driven process (in which solar\nwind energy is directly dissipated into the ionosphere and ring\ncurrent) plays the dominant role in the driving and control of\nthe tail dynamics and particle injection activity of category 2\nevents. Category 1 events, in contrast, are more influenced by\nthe loading\u2010unloading process (in which solar wind energy is\nfirst stored in the magnetosphere during the substorm growth\nphase before subsequently being released during substorm\nexpansion). The increased activity and continuous driving for\ncategory 2 events may result in the more active conditions\nseen in the LANL energetic particle data. This increase in\nactivity can complicate or hide any \u201cclassic\u201d substorm injec-\ntion evolution, making it difficult to discern true substorm\ninjection activity from non\u2010substorm\u2010like behavior. It is\nunclear whether the varied injection activity seen for category\n2 events is due to modification of the classic injection sig-\nnature due to more active tail dynamics and directly driven\nmagnetosphere, whether the substorm injection is hidden or\ncomplicated by other nonsubstorm particle activity, or indeed\nwhether the auroral brightenings identified as substorm onset\nare caused by this nonsubstorm activity itself and are not true\nglobal substorms, or, perhaps more likely, a combination of\nall of these. A more detailed study of the tail dynamics during\nthese events may reveal the true nature of these events.\nHowever, the results presented here suggest that the level and\ncontinuity of dayside solar wind driving of themagnetosphere\nhave a direct influence on the particle injection signature seen\nat geosynchronous orbit during substorms.\n[35] Category 3 events do not show the expected sig-\nnatures of global substorm onset events in many of the\nparameters studied and only very weak signatures of sub-\nstorm and nightside reconnection activity in auroral intensity\nand AU and AL indices compared to category 1 and 2 events,\nsuggesting that they are very weak nightside reconnection\nevents. Miyashita et al. [2004] used observations of the tail\nmagnetic field variations during substorms to show that the\ninitial reconnection site of intense substorms (i.e., category 1)\ntends to be located closer to Earth than that of weaker events\n(i.e., category 3). Nagai et al. [2005] also showed that sub-\nstorms occurring with stronger or more efficient solar wind\nenergy input (i.e., category 1\/2) have their onset location\ncloser to Earth than those with weaker driving (i.e., cate-\ngory 3). The size of the energetic particle injection seen at\ngeosynchronous orbit (and at any fixed observing position)\nis due to a combination of the particle acceleration (which\nmoves the relatively higher fluxes of low\u2010energy particles\nto higher energies) and particle transport (which determines\nwhether these higher fluxes of high\u2010energy particles encounter\nthe observer). The particle acceleration is by the inductive\nelectric field associated with the magnetic field dipolarization\nat substorm onset and, hence, will likely be larger for tail\nmagnetic fields that are more stretched (nondipolar) prior to\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n9 of 12\nonset. The transport is a combination of (noninductive) E \u00d7 B\nconvection and gradient\u2010curvature drift, and so will likely\nnot bring particles energized in the tail by dipolarization into\ngeosynchronous orbit if the E \u00d7 B convection toward Earth is\nweak compared to the mainly azimuthal gradient\u2010curvature\ndrift. Thus the weak category 3 injections, compared to cat-\negories 1 and 2, can be explained by the weaker solar wind\ninput for these events, which causes (a) the tail field to be less\nstretched at onset and, hence, the particle energization from\nthe field dipolarization to be weaker and (b) the stretched field\nline region (and hence the reconnection X line) to be farther\ndowntail and the E \u00d7 B convection to be weaker, such that any\nenergized particles from (a) will mostly not encounter geo-\nsynchronous orbit. Figure 2 presents the distributions of the\ninitial onset latitude of the auroral brightening indentified as\nsubstorm onset by Frey et al. [2004] for the three LANL\ncategories. The mean and median of onset latitudes for each\ncategory are shown by the vertical solid and dashed lines,\nrespectively. Although, in general, onsets from all categories\ncover approximately the same latitudinal range, a greater\nproportion of category 3 events occurs at higher latitudes\ncompared to either category 1 or category 2, suggesting that\nthe onset region is indeed located farther from Earth for cat-\negory 3 events.\n5. Conclusions\n[36] We have carried out a superposed epoch analysis of\nthe hemispheric open magnetic flux content of the magneto-\nsphere, maximum nightside auroral intensity, geomagnetic\nactivity, and solar wind and IMF conditions around the time\nof substorm onset for three distinct categories of substorms\ndefined by their particle injection signatures as seen at geo-\nsynchronous orbit by the LANL spacecraft. Substorms iden-\ntified from global auroral imagery have been divided into\nthose associated with a \u201cclassic\u201d particle injection signature\nof substorm onset (category 1), those that showed all other\nparticle enhancements not following this classical evolution\n(category 2), and those events that we could not associate with\nany significant particle enhancement (category 3). Of a total\nFigure 2. Distributions of onset latitude for the three particle injection categories of substorms. Green\nrepresents category 1, red represents category 2, and blue represents category 3. Solid and dashed vertical\nlines represent the mean and medians of the distribution, respectively.\nBOAKES ET AL.: SUBSTORM INJECTION AND SOLAR WIND DRIVING A01214A01214\n10 of 12\nof 451 substorm events identified from global auroral imag-\nery in the months of December and January 2000\u20132002 by\nFrey et al. [2004], we are able to classify 306 events into the\nthree LANL categories, finding relatively even numbers in\neach: 100 (33%) in category 1, 114 (37%) in category 2, and\n92 (30%) in category 3. We summarize our findings of the\nsuperposed epoch analysis as follows.\n[37] 1. Category 1 events show all the expected sig-\nnatures of classic substorm onsets, occurring owing to a large\nsouthward turning of the IMF Bz component in the substorm\ngrowth phase during otherwise average IMF and solar wind\nconditions.\n[38] 2. Category 2 events appear to occur when the mag-\nnetosphere is continuously driven by dayside reconnection\nthroughout the substorm growth and expansion phases,\nobserved as the continued elevation of the negative mag-\nnitude of the IMF Bz component and Akasofu \" parameter\nduring substorm expansion, as well as the slow decline of\nopen magnetic flux, auroral intensity, and geomagnetic\nactivity back to presubstorm magnitudes. The magnitude of\nthe IMF By component is also enhanced, compared to other\ncategories and the IMF Bz, suggesting that the IMF By\ncomponent may play a more important role in the dayside\nreconnection for these events. They also generally occur\nduring more active solar wind and IMF conditions.\n[39] 3. Category 3 events occur during much weaker solar\nwind, IMF, and geomagnetic conditions than either category 1\nor category 2. They appear to be very weak substorm events\nor pseudobreakups.\n[40] The results of this study suggest that the level and\ncontinuity of the dayside solar wind driving of the magneto-\nsphere during substorms has a direct influence on the injection\nof energetic particles to geosynchronous orbit at substorm\nonset. Future investigation of the magnetotail magnetic field\nconditions and plasma sheet evolution for the three distinct\nparticle injection categories may provide important insights\ninto the substorm injection process and its relation to solar\nwind driving and magnetospheric dynamics. The results\npresented in this paper, and future work, may have con-\nsiderable value for studies of space weather, in particular,\nempirical predictions and models of the near\u2010Earth space\nenvironment.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
