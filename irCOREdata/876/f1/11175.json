A. Kihn\nNational Geophysical Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Boulder, Colorado, USA\nA. J. Ridley\nCenter for Space Environment Modeling, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA\nReceived 23 December 2003; revised 28 January 2005; accepted 8 March 2005; published 22 July 2005.\n[1] The assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) technique utilizes a\nwide range of electrodynamics measurements to determine high-latitude maps of the\nelectric potential, electron particle precipitation (average energy and total energy flux), and\nionospheric conductance (Hall and Pedersen). AMIE does this by conducting a least\nsquares fit to the difference between the data and a background model. This fit is then\nadded to the background model. This allows for a very stable technique with even minimal\namounts of data. The background models are typically statistical models that are driven by\nthe solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field or the hemispheric power index. This\nstudy presents results of a statistical validation of the AMIE conductance and particle\nprecipitation calculations and quantifies how using ground magnetometer derived\nmeasurements improves upon the result obtained using only a background statistical\nmodel. Specifically, we compare AMIE using the Fuller-Rowell and Evans (1987) model\nof particle precipitation and ionospheric conductances to DMSP particle precipitation\nmeasurements during the period from May to November 1998. The conductances are\nderived from the particle precipitation using the Robinson et al. (1987) formulation. The\nFuller-Rowell and Evans (1987) results show low (39\u201321% with increasing AE) energy\nflux integrals with respect to DMSP auroral passes and differences in mean electron\nenergies. The AMIE runs, in which ground-based magnetometers were used to modify the\nparticle precipitation using the formulation by Ahn et al. (1983) and Ahn et al. (1998),\nshow significant improvement in correlation to the observational data. We show that it\nmore accurately predicts the particle precipitation than when using only the background\nmodel, especially in the 1800\u20130300 MLT nightside sectors where solar conductance is\nnot significant. In addition, the AMIE results show a clear increase in accuracy with\nincreasing number of magnetometers in a sector.\nCitation: Kihn, E. A., and A. J.

Introduction\n[2] Understanding the complex interactions that couple\nthe solar wind to the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and ionosphere\nis an essential component of space weather prediction.\nNowcasting\/forecasting the high-latitude ionospheric current\npattern has drawn increasing attention as a tool to support\noperational space weather needs. This is in part due to more\nmodels becoming available that can reliably forecast this\nvery complex domain [Singer et al., 2001].\n[3] There are three primary ways of computing the high-\nlatitude horizontal current structure. The first method is to\ntake an electric potential pattern (produced from either an\nempirical relationship or a data inversion), apply iono-\nspheric Hall and Pedersen conductance patterns to it, and\ncalculate the horizontal current:\nj \u00bc \u00022 \u0003 rf; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere j is the current, 2 is the conductance matrix, and f is\nthe potential. The second methodology is used extensively\nin global and inner magnetospheric models [Goodman,\n1995; A. Ridley et al., Ionospheric control of the magneto-\nspheric configuration (1): Conductance, submitted to\nAnnales Geophysicae, 2005]. These models solve the\ndivergence of the above equation for the potential and the\ncurrents:\njr \u00bc r? \u0003 2 \u0003 rf\u00f0 \u00de?; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere jr is the radial current density (provided by the\nmagnetospheric simulation) and r? is the divergence\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A07305, doi:10.1029\/2003JA010371, 2005\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2003JA010371$09.00\nA07305 1 of 11\nperpendicular to the magnetic field. Once the potential is\nsolved for, the horizontal current can then be determined\nusing equation (1). The MHD models infer the conduc-\ntances from the field-aligned current pattern. The third\nmethodology involves inverting magnetometer data to\ndetermine the horizontal current pattern. These current\npatterns can then be used to determine the electric potential\ngiven a conductance matrix.\n[4] Empirical models of the ionospheric potential such as\nPapitashvili et al. [1994], Weimer [1996], Ruohoniemi and\nGreenwald [1996], and Ridley et al. [2000] can be driven\nsolely by the upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\nand solar wind conditions which provide a pattern that is\nstatistically consistent with the impending IMF condition.\nThese models have the advantage of providing true forecasts\nby propagating the observed IMF condition from spacecraft\nsuch as ACE [Stone et al., 1998] to the Earth [Ridley, 2000]\narriving at a likely potential pattern. However, because they\nare statistically based, they cannot capture the transients in\nthe environment that may be precisely what is needed in\nan operational mode. An emerging methodology using first-\nprinciples models of the magnetosphere offers promise for\nthe future but currently is too computationally expensive to\nsupport real-time operational needs [Ridley et al., 2001]. A\nthird class of models uses various data assimilation tech-\nniques such as data inversion or spherical harmonic analysis\nto convert observational inputs into a global ionospheric\npattern. Methods such as Ruohoniemi and Greenwald [1996]\nor KRM [Kamide et al., 1981] provide a nowcast of\nthe ionospheric potential that is consistent with current\nobservational data and can be used to predict the short-\nterm future evolution of the pattern. This type of model\nprovides the current best approach to supporting near-real-\ntime operations.\n[5] It is clear that in order to determine either the potential\npattern from currents (or ground-based magnetometers) or\nthe horizontal current pattern from an electric potential\npattern, it is essential to have accurate estimates of the\nconductance pattern. There is a secondary need for accurate\nspecifications of the conductance: the ionospheric Joule\nheating is directly dependent upon the Pedersen conductiv-\nity. The Joule heating can cause the thermosphere to heat up\nand expand, causing significantly increased satellite drag. In\naddition, significant Joule heating can cause changes in\ntemperature dependent reaction rates, thereby changing the\ncomposition of the ionosphere and thermosphere. It is\ntherefore quite important to accurately specify the Pedersen\nconductance.\n[6] The total conductance is divided into a solar-induced\ncomponent and that resulting from precipitating particles.\nModels such as those presented by Sotirelis and Newell\n[2000], Fuller-Rowell and Evans [1987], and Spiro et al.\n[1982] describe the general patterns for electron precipita-\ntion binned by the observed space weather conditions. The\nsolar-induced component is typically described by Brekke et\nal. [1974], Horwitz et al. [1978], Vickrey et al. [1981],\nWallis and Budzinski [1981], Moen and Brekke [1993], or\nLilensten et al. [1996]. This study is focused on quantifying\nhow well the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electro-\ndynamics (AMIE) technique [Richmond and Kamide, 1988;\nRichmond, 1992] is able to create a conductance pattern\nusing magnetometer and hemispheric power index (HPI)\ndata as inputs. This is the first of several studies which will\nquantify, statistically, the performance of the AMIE tech-\nnique and its background models in terms of their accuracy\nin estimating the electric potential, conductance, ground\nmagnetic perturbations, and derived parameters.\n[7] AMIE is a data inversion technique that blends\nelectrodynamic observations and statistical representations\nto produce estimates of high-latitude conductances, electric\nfields, and electric currents. The technique is designed to\nincorporate a large number of observed fields, thereby\nincreasing the number of data types and sources and hence\nthe accuracy of the specification. When operating in a real-\ntime or near real-time mode (i.e., rtAMIE), the available\ndata is typically quite limited. Using rtAMIE means using\nonly the IMF data available from ACE, the HPI measured in\nthe last few hours, the F10.7, and the ground magnetometer\ndata available from the various observing chains, typically\n\b20 high-latitude stations.\n[8] We have collected, cleaned, and quality controlled\n5 years (1997 to 2001) of global magnetometer data\nand used this, as well as the available solar wind and\nIMF, HPI, F10.7, and Dst data to produce an archive of\nAMIE runs at 1-min resolution [Ridley and Kihn, 2004].\nBecause of the uneven station coverage between hemi-\nspheres, for this study we have chosen to compare the\nnorthern hemisphere AMIE predictions of precipitating elec-\ntron energy and flux with DMSP satellite observations for\nMay to November 1998 (7 months). The ground station data\navailable in this period is very stable and the typical coverage\nis shown in Figure 1. Approximately 65 magnetometer\nstations were used for the electron precipitation calculations.\nApproximately 90 high-latitude and midlatitude stations\nwere used in the calculation of the electric potential pattern,\nalthough the potentials are not described here. The auroral\nmagnetometers were also used to calculate the different\nauroral electrojet indices (AL, AU, and AE). In this study,\nwhen we use HPI data, we take the DMSP satellite estimate\nfrom the time closest to a given AMIE run. Thus most likely\nthe estimate is from the particular satellite orbit being studied.\n[9] We use the DMSP SSJ\/4 data [Hardy et al., 1984]\narchived at the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)\nto provide the observational comparison. This comes to\nover 11,000 northern polar cap crossings by the four\nspacecraft (F11\u2013F14) available during this time. We do\nnot address intersatellite differences and instead look only at\nthe composite data binned in MLT, magnetic latitude, and\nactivity level, as determined from the AL index found from\nthe available auroral magnetometers.\n2. Methodology\n[10] AMIE is typically referred to as a least squares data\ninversion technique. AMIE is different than many data\ninversion techniques in that it subtracts a background\npattern from the data and fits to the differences between\nthe data and the background pattern. In addition, AMIE uses\na covarience matrix to constrain the fit, allowing for large\nspatial gaps between data points without spurious maxima\nand minima in the fitted quantity. This technique allows\nAMIE to force the fit result away from the data to be close\nto zero, which makes it a very stable technique. This\nmethodology is similar to a Kalman filter.\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n2 of 11\nA07305\n[11] AMIE can complete a total of four data inversions:\n(1) the average energy of precipitating electrons (E); (2) the\ntotal energy flux of precipitating electrons (FE); (3) the Hall\n(SH) and Pedersen (SP) conductance; and (4) the electric\npotential. The user must select to fit either the electron\nprecipitation information and\/or the Hall and Pedersen\nconductances. If the user selects the precipitation only, the\nHall and Pedersen conductances are derived from the\nrelationships formulated by [Robinson et al., 1987]:\nSP \u00bc 40E\n16\u00fe E2\nF1=2E \u00f03\u00de\nand\nSH \u00bc 0:45 E\n\u0001 \u00020:85SP: \u00f04\u00de\n[12] In order to understand how well or how poorly the\nAMIE technique reproduces the different ionospheric elec-\ntrodynamic quantities, it is best to start from the root\nparameter. This is the background model of the electron\nprecipitation and the conductance pattern. AMIE takes this\nbackground pattern, subtracts it from the data, and inverts\nthat to determine a difference pattern. This is added back to\nthe background pattern. The Hall conductance pattern is\nthen used in combination with the magnetometer data to\ndetermine an electric potential pattern. It is the goal of this\nstudy to examine how well this method of conductance\npattern determination is working in AMIE.\n[13] In our usage of AMIE for this study, the data\n(magnetometers, IMF, and HPI) are read in by AMIE.\nEstimates of the conductance are derived from the magne-\ntometer data using Ahn et al. [1983, 1998] (henceforth Ahn)\nwhere applicable (shown in Figure 1 as stars) and the\nmagnetometer data is converted to a total Hall and Pedersen\nconductance. The solar conductance is subtracted from\nthe total conductance: SHa =\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nS2Ht \u0002 S2Hs\nq\n, where SHa is\nthe Hall conductance due to auroral precipitation, SHt is the\ntotal Hall conductance, specified by the Ahn formulation,\nand SHs is the Hall conductance specified by the model of\nthe solar conductance. The same is done for the Pedersen\nconductance. Ridley and Kihn [2004] gives the formulation\nfor the solar conductance used within AMIE. Each \u2018\u2018mea-\nsurement\u2019\u2019 (derived through Ahn) of the auroral Hall and\nPedersen conductance is then converted into a total energy\nflux and average energy using the Robinson et al. [1987]\nformulation (as described by Ahn et al. [1998]). These\n\u2018\u2018measurements\u2019\u2019 of the precipitation are used in the inver-\nsions within AMIE, as described above. The background\nconductance model used in this study is described by\nFuller-Rowell and Evans [1987] (henceforth FRE). We\npoint out here that a limitation of Ahn is that it applies\nprimarily to the 1800\u20130300 MLT sectors. This is because\nthe average energy of the particles precipitating in the noon\nsector is small and their contribution to the conductance is\nminimal. Therefore a magnetic disturbance recorded around\nnoon is seldom associated with significant conductance\nenhancement. As a result, there are not enough data points\nFigure 1. These plots show the ground-based magnetometer coverage for four different universal times\n(UTs) of 4 May 1998. Each diamond represents a magnetometer station that was used in the electric\npotential calculation, while the stars represent stations used to calculate the particle precipitation.\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n3 of 11\nA07305\ncapturing conductance enhancement on the dayside to\ninclude in the Ahn model.\n[14] While there are obviously many assumptions that go\ninto using the magnetometers to determine the particle\nprecipitation, there are advantages to this technique:\n(1) magnetometers offer a consistency in location of mea-\nsurement that many other techniques (such as in situ\nsatellite measurements) do not offer; (2) imagers from\nsatellites only view the total auroral oval for a small period\nof time during the day, while magnetometers offer a semi-\nglobal view of the auroral oval all day, every day; (3) many\nof the other techniques, such as global imagery from\nsatellites and incoherent scatter radar measurements of the\nconductance, have many assumptions that also enter into the\ncalculations; (4) this technique allows a determination of\nthe global electric potential for many years on a 1 min\ntimescale, which cannot be done by any other technique\nwith nearly the same global scale coverage; and (5) because\nthere are magnetometer stations available in near-real-time\nand since the input to these models is solely the ground\nmagnetic disturbance data, these models are likely candi-\ndates to be employed by real-time techniques.\n[15] One part of the process that needs to be clarified is\nthat the FRE model is presented in terms of characteristic\nenergy and AMIE needs to convert this to an average energy\nto complete the inversion. To do this, AMIE assumes a\nMaxwellian particle spectrum and must choose the temper-\nature that best matches either the correlation with the\nTIROS Hall conductance, Pedersen conductance, or the\nratio of the two. In our study we choose the latter. It is\npossible to utilize other background models, such as by\nSotirelis and Newell [2000] or Hardy et al. [1985], but it is\nbeyond the scope of this initial investigation to compare\nmultiple background models.\n[16] Very few studies have been published on how well\nAMIE reproduces data sets that were not used in the\ninversion. Lu et al. [2001] investigated the sensitivity of\nAMIE during a single time period. No study has been\npublished that statistically validates AMIE. Ridley and Kihn\n[2004] investigated the relationship between the Polar Cap\nIndex and AMIE cross polar cap potential, electric field, and\npolar cap area for a period of 5 years (1997\u20132001) but did\nnot consider the comparison a validation of either.\n[17] In this study, we compare independent observational\ndata to both the background FRE model and the AMIE\nresults when the magnetometers have been used to modify\nthe FRE patterns, as described above. Both model patterns\nare output on a magnetic local time (MLT) by magnetic\nlatitude (APEX coordinate) grid. The resolution of the\nresults for this period is 2\u0004 latitude by 1 hour of MLT.\n[18] The DMSP electron precipitation data is taken in\n30 logarithmically spaced bins between 30 eV and 30 keV\n4 times per second. In our study only the spectrum above\n500 eV is used. This is because much of the number flux is\nin the low-energy electrons but the spectrum is non-\nMaxwellian there [Rich et al., 1987]. An average energy\nand total energy flux are computed for each 1\/4 s, and these\nquantities are averaged into 15 s bins. This gives a spatial\nresolution of approximately 0.9\u0004 on a great circle or about\n100 km.\n[19] Many of the DMSP orbits contain extremely large\nspikes in the total energy flux. These are most likely caused\nby intense small-scale auroral arcs, which neither the FRE\nmodel nor AMIE can reproduce since they are significantly\nsmaller than the grid resolution. To attempt to minimize the\nbiasing of the small-scale auroral arcs on the statistical\nanalysis, we weight the different parameters (i.e., energy\nflux, Hall conductance) by a factor based on how smooth\nFigure 2. A comparison between total electron precipitation in mW\/m and Hall conductances in mhos\ncalculated from the assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) technique (dashed\nlines) using only ground-based magnetometer and DMSP J4 measured electron precipitation and\nestimated Hall conductances (solid lines) using the Robinson et al. [1987] formulation. The dotted line in\nthe top plot is a 10 point running average of the DMSP measured electron precipitation. The plots on the\nleft show the AMIE results of electron energy (top) and Hall conductance (bottom) with the locations of\nthe ground-based magnetometers and DMSP satellite overplotted. In these plots, the magnetic pole is\nat the center, while the outer circle is at 50\u0004. Dusk is to the left, while the Sun is toward the top of the\nfigure. The start of the DMSP pass is indicated as an \u2018\u2018F14\u2019\u2019 (i.e. the name of the satellite).\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n4 of 11\nA07305\nthe auroral oval is over that particular pass. This factor is the\ncross-correlation between the 100 km resolution DMSP data\nand the DMSP data smoothed over an approximately\n1000 km moving window. Any large spike in the 100 km\nresolution data causes a decrease in the cross-correlation. The\n1000 kmmoving window allows large-scale features, such as\ndouble ovals, to have high correlations. A graphic illustrating\na typical comparison is shown in Figure 2. In each figure that\nshows the DMSP data, the 1000 kmmoving window average\nis shown as a dotted line in the total energy flux plot.\nFigure 3. The top four plots are comparisons between DMSP and AMIE using the Fuller-Rowell and\nEvans [1987, hereinafter referred to as FRE] background model, while the bottom four plots are\ncomparisons between AMIE using the magnetometer data and the DMSP data. In each group of four\nplots, the top plot is the latitudinal difference between the location of the measured and modeled peak\nauroral flux, the second plot is the percent difference between the modelled and measured peak auroral\nflux, the third plot is the percent difference between the measured and modelled integrated flux, and the\nfourth plot summarizes the difference in peak Hall conductance. The vertical axis the activity level, while\nthe horizontal axis is the magnetic local time of the measurement.\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n5 of 11\nA07305\n[20] As each DMSP orbital path crosses the patterns, the\nresults are linearly interpolated to the location of the satellite\nat the given time, and a comparison is made with the\nobserved total electron energy flux and the Hall conduc-\ntance calculated from observations from the spacecraft. We\nchoose these two quantities because the electron energy\nflux is quite important in determining the electron energy\ndeposition and ionization rates throughout the atmosphere\nand the Hall conductance is directly relevant to the inver-\nsion of the ground-based magnetic perturbations. It should\nbe noted that the pattern closest in time to the DMSP\nmeasurement is used in the comparison. In order to sum-\nmarize the results across multiple passes, the data are\ndivided into dawn and dusk flight segments. Each segment\nis then compared with the model results in terms of\npercentage difference in peak electron flux value (%-Diff\nPk Flux), the percentage difference integral electron flux\n(%-Diff Int Flux), the percentage difference in peak Hall\nvalue (%-Diff Pk Hall), and the latitude difference of the\nobserved peak flux (Lat. diff (Peak)). This is done for both\nAMIE using only the FRE model and including the Ahn\ntechnique.\n[21] The integral flux is defined as a line integral of the\ntotal energy flux over approximately 2000 km, centered on\nthe location of the DMSP measured peak energy flux. This\nis meant to give an indication of the total energy flux within\nthe auroral oval for that particular region. If, for example,\nthe modeled patterns had a too small maximum peak flux\nand it smeared out the auroral oval too much, the total\nauroral energy going to the ionosphere over that region may\nstill be correct. The DMSP and model integrals are\ndifferenced and then divided by the maximum of the two\nintegrals to come up with a percentage difference. If the\nnumber is positive, then the DMSP energy flux is larger; if\nit is negative, the model energy flux is larger.\n[22] We further calculate the zero lag cross-correlation\nwith the models (CC w\/DMSP), then each orbit is split into\nascending and descending segments and the individual\nsegments are shifted to where the cross-correlation is\nmaximized. This is recorded as the (Lat. diff (CC)), which\nprovides a measure of the models\u2019 success in size and\nplacement of the auroral oval.\n[23] The results produced above are binned relative to\ndifferent criteria, such as the calculated lower auroral\nelectrojet (AL) index, number of magnetometers in a sector,\nand MLT. This allows the investigation of any systematic\ndifferences due to activity level and local time. In addition,\nit allows a quantitative determination of how well the\npatterns are improved by adding magnetometers in given\nsectors.\n3. Results\n[24] The results of the study are summarized in Tables 1\u2013\n4 and in Figure 3. Several points are of obvious interest in\nthe resulting data. The first is that the flux calculated from\nFRE is much lower than that observed by DMSP SSJ4 at\nlow activity levels. This is true both in the peak flux, which\ntends to be over 60% under the observed values, and the\nintegral flux, which is nearly 40% too low. Both of these\nshow improvement under more active conditions though.\nFor example, comparing Tables 1\u20133, the percent difference\nTable 1.

This trend is smaller in\nthe percent difference of the peak flux (i.e., \u2018\u2018%-Diff Pk\nFlux\u2019\u2019). Interestingly, the trend reverses in the peak Hall\nconductance. As the activity level increases, the deviation\nfrom the data increases. This means that the difference is in\nthe average energy calculation, since the peak Hall conduc-\ntance is closely tied to the average energy, as equations (3)\nand (4) illustrate.\n[25] A second result is that the inclusion of the magne-\ntometer data (i.e., the AMIE results including the magne-\ntometer data via the Ahn formulation) appears to help in the\nintegrated and peak flux specification at all MLTs and at all\nactivity levels. The level of improvement in the results\nvaries dramatically from one bin to another, but there is\nimprovement everywhere. This result is seen most signifi-\ncantly in the 1800\u20130300 MLT region where solar conduc-\ntance is minimal. Interestingly, the improvement in the\nspecification of the peak Hall conductance by including\nthe magnetometer data is less than the improvement in the\npeak and integrated flux. Once again, this probably has to\ndo with the prediction of the average energy flux.\n[26] Another result from the tables is that with respect to\nthe placement of the peak flux, both FRE and AMIE do\nreasonably well. The difference in peak is comparable to the\ngrid resolution of the results. Notice, however, that as the\nactivity level increases the values flip from positive to\nnegative, indicating that for low activity the models place\nthe auroral boundary too low and for high activity levels\nthey place the boundary too high (see Figure 3), so the\nrange of the model aurora is more restricted in going from\nhigh latitudes during low activity periods to lower latitudes\nin high activity periods. Interestingly, AMIE with Ahn does\nnot show any marked improvement in the peak placement\nover the FRE model. This probably owes to two factors:\n(1) the AMIE grid resolution precludes the shift provided by\nincluding magnetometer data reflecting as actual grid cell\nchanges, and (2) the occasional peak in the polar cap region\nas observed by DMSP is captured by neither the FRE model\nnor AMIE. Within AMIE, this is due to the lack of high-\nlatitude stations. Also of note is the fact that the Lat. diff\n(CC) is always negative, indicating a better correlation\nwhen the model is shifted poleward. It is unclear the cause\nof this, but we suspect it has to do with all the polar\nprecipitation observed by DMSP, especially at low activi-\nties, which is not captured by AMIE.\n[27] The value of the cross-correlation coefficient (zero\nlag cc w\/DMSP) is fairly low (0.5\u20130.6) in most cases,\nindicating that while both models are getting the gross shape\nof the aurora, they miss significant elements of the fine\nstructure. The cross-correlation shows a definite improve-\nment with increasing activity level in both models, probably\nbecause as the activity increases the auroral boundary takes\na more definite shape.\n[28] Table 4 shows how the number of magnetometers in\na given sector influences the AMIE solution. This table\nshows that there is marked improvement in the peak and\nintegral flux estimate when there are multiple magneto-\nmeters in a sector. The result shows positive influence on\nthe estimate starting with one or two up through five\nmagnetometers in a sector. There is a significant jump in\nperformance between zero (i.e., the FRE model with no data\nincluded) and five magnetometers. The eventual errors of\n\b30% are within the error range given in the Ahn formu-\nlation [Ahn et al., 1998]. It is interesting to note that in\nnearly all cases the AMIE total energy flux and peak Hall\nconductance values are below the observations. Another\nresult is that percentage difference in the peak flux and peak\nHall conductance underestimates increase with increasing\nactivity level. This means that AMIE is underpredicting the\npeak flux and peak Hall conductances more as the activity\nlevel increases. This does not seem to be true for the integral\nflux, however, indicating that the model is getting the total\nflux of particles into the auroral oval correct but not in a\nTable 3.

In the discussion section below we\npresent possible explanations for some of the model defi-\nciencies compared with observational data.\n4. Discussion\n[29] AMIE can use a wide variety of data to complete its\ninversions. These include incoherent scatter radar line of\nsight measurements and conductance estimates, high-\nfrequency radar line of sight data (such as from Super-\nDARN), in situ measurements of flow velocities, particle\nprecipitation, and magnetic fields (such as from the DMSP,\nNOAA, UARS, FAST, and other satellites), imaging data of\nthe aurora (such as from POLAR UVI or IMAGE FUV), and\nground-based magnetic field measurements. However, the\nmost readily available data on this list are the ground-based\nmagnetic field measurements. AMIE is therefore most often\nrun including a significant amount of magnetometer data.\n[30] Some advantages with using ground-based magne-\ntometer data are (1) consistency of data during an event,\n(2) global data coverage, (3) data availability, and (4) rela-\ntive ease of use in statistical studies. Ground-based magne-\ntometer data also have some disadvantages: (1) lack of\ncoverage over the oceans; (2) magnetometers are integrating\ndevices, so they tend to smear out small-scale features; and,\nprobably the most significant, (3) the ionospheric Hall\nconductance must be accurately specified in order to deter-\nmine the true ionospheric electric field above a ground-\nbased magnetic field measurement.\n[31] Because there are both advantages and disadvantages\nwith these measurements, AMIE is usually run with other\ndata sets, which may complement the magnetometer data.\nFor example, SuperDARN radars measure the ion flow\nvelocities in the F region of the ionosphere. Since this is\na (more) direct measurement of the electric field, it comple-\nments the magnetometer\u2019s need to use the conductance.\nConversely, SuperDARN radar measurements drop out in\nlarge portions of the high-latitude region during some\nevents. The magnetometer data offer a temporal consistency\nwhich allows studies of how the ionospheric convection\nFigure 4. These plots show a comparison of the DMSP J4 measurements and the FRE patterns for\n4 May 1998 in the same format as Figure 2.\nFigure 5. A comparison of the AMIE derived electron precipitation and Hall conductance with the\nDMSP J4 measurements on 4 May 1998.\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n8 of 11\nA07305\n(and auroral activity) may change with time on a global\nscale. For example, the study by Ridley et al. [1998]\npresents global patterns of the changing convection using\nmagnetometer data, while Ruohoniemi and Greenwald\n[1998] shows how the convection may change at two\nlocations directly using SuperDARN data. Given all these\npossible configurations, it is important to emphasize that\nour study focuses on AMIE run using only magnetometer\ndata.\n[32] Looking first at the Fuller-Rowell and Evans [1987]\nmodel based runs as presented in Tables 1\u20133, several points\nbecome apparent. The first is that this model underestimates\nthe electron energy flux. It is true for both peak flux and\nintegral flux. Since this is a statistical model and therefore\nlikely to flatten sharp peaks, the result with respect to peak\nflux is somewhat expected. However, even the integrated\nflux is low by approximately 40%. There are several\npossibilities that could explain the discrepancy. The FRE\nmodel uses as input the hemispherical power index (HPI),\nwhich unfortunately varies rather slowly as compared with\nthe cross-polar flight of DMSP. This means that while\nDMSP is sampling the instant particle measurement, the\nFRE pattern is fixed to some moment along the flight. If it\nwere possible to generate a higher-cadence HPI, this might\nshow some improvement. Another possible cause for a\nsignificant error is the difference between the NOAA-\nTIROS instrument package (which was used to build the\nFRE model) and the DMSP-SSJ4 instrument, which was\nused in the comparisons and also used to estimate the HPI\nneeded to run the FRE model.\n[33] Preliminary work comparing the two systems over a\nlong term with respect to HPI measurements indicates that\na 20\u201340% difference between instruments is not unlikely\n(B. Emery, private communication, 2005). Figure 4 shows a\ntypical result using the FRE model. The peak value, while\napproximately in the correct location, is well under the\nobservation and the total integral flux (i.e., the area under\nthe curve) is also much too small.\n[34] A good example of the improvement gained by\nincluding the magnetometer data is shown in Figure 5. In\nthis case the station placement is just right to get the top and\nthe bottom of the auroral oval. Thus the model puts the flux\nFigure 6. An example of a pass in which the ascending part of the pass had very good station coverage\nwhile the descending part of the pass had poor coverage.\nFigure 7. An example of the complex auroral structures measured by DMSP J4 on 1 May 1998.\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n9 of 11\nA07305\nin just the right place and improves the magnitude estimate.\nIn Figure 6, we see an example where there are no stations\ncovering the descending part of the orbit and the conduc-\ntance model reverts to the FRE background estimate. In this\ncase there are significant differences both in the electron\nflux and the conductance.\n[35] Another problem typical in this study is the obser-\nvation of auroral arcs poleward of the main aurora. Figure 7\nshows an example in which AMIE seems to have the\nduskside main auroral oval placement correct but on the\ndawnside there is a big peak at higher latitude. With no\nstations at high latitude to correct from the background, this\nleads to an underestimate of peak flux and a latitude\ndifference in the peak locations. This is observed fairly\nregularly on both ascending and descending segments,\nleading to some bias of the statistics.\n[36] Figure 8 shows another problem in both models,\nwhich is dealing with highly structured auroral precipita-\ntion. As can be seen in both the Hall and electron energy\nflux plots, the AMIE result captures the overall shape but\nmisses significant changes in the curve. This is despite\nhaving adequate ground coverage on the ascending segment\nof the pass. AMIE is capable of producing some structure\neven at its coarse resolution as in Figure 8, but even then it\nis insufficient for capturing the changes adequately.\n5. Conclusion\n[37] Both the Fuller-Rowell and Evans [1987] and AMIE\ntechnique do a reasonable job of placing the auroral oval and\nreproducing the magnitude of the peak flux and integrated\nflux. There is a strong bias toward underestimating the\nelectron flux and Hall conductance, which is very pro-\nnounced in the FRE model. Inclusion of magnetometer data\ninto AMIE improves this underestimation. In particular,\nthose MLTs where Ahn et al. [1998] applies (1500\u2013\n0300 MLT) see gains if they have any station coverage and\nsignificant improvement where there is more complete\nstation coverage (e.g., five or more magnetometers). It\nprovides improvement in peak e-flux, peak Hall conduc-\ntance, latitude difference of the peak flux and Max-CC\nlatitude difference. This is particularly true in the afternoon\nto postmidnight sectors where substantial performance gains\nare evident. However, even with the magnetometer data,\nAMIE has significant underestimates of the e-flux in the\n0300\u20131500MLTsector. This is because the Ahn et al. [1998]\nFigure 8. Two examples of highly structured aurora ovals. In the top example, AMIE smoothes out the\noval too much to capture the structure. In the bottom example, AMIE produces a double oval, similar to\nthat measured by the DMSP satellite.\nA07305 KIHN AND RIDLEY: AMIE CONDUCTANCE VALIDATION\n10 of 11\nA07305\nformulation does not apply in this sector, so the Ahn et al.\n[1983] formulation must be used instead. Unfortunately, for\nuse with real-time applications AMIE sees its most signifi-\ncant gains with five or more stations in a sector, which is\nseldom the case anywhere in near-real-time. The fact that\nAMIE relies heavily on the background model in areas in\nwhich there is little data and that the FRE model under-\nestimates the electron energy flux with respect to DMSP is\nreason to investigate whether a different model, such as\nSotirelis and Newell [2000] might produce better correlation.\n[38] The study shows that AMIE is limited in its ability to\nreproduce fine-scale features. Even with multiple magneto-\nmeters in a sector, the result is not well correlated with the\nobserved pattern. This is partly because of the reliance of\nrtAMIE on a background model and partly due to the\ndistribution of the stations within a sector. We suggest that\nit would be beneficial to modify AMIE to have a variable\nhigher-resolution grid structure across the auroral zone.\n[39] A typical DMSP pass shows a great deal of structure\nin the polar region and these changes should be reflected in\nthe AMIE result. It is not clear if there are any models\navailable at this time that can produce this result using real-\ntime inputs only.\n[40] Finally, it is worth noting that in this study we\nspecifically excluded any DMSP instruments and other\nsatellite data from the input data (except to drive the\nbackground model, in the form of the HPI). As a data\ningest model, AMIE is fully capable of ingesting the DMSP\nobservations, and if it were possible to obtain the full data in\nreal-time, rtAMIE could include them to produce much\nimproved results. The NOAA HPI is available in near-real-\ntime, so this can be (and is) used in rtAMIE to drive the\nbackground model.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
