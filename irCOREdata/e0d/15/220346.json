In adults, significant reduction in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and hookworm infections was also observed. More importantly, the prevalence and intensity of both S. mansoni and hookworm infections in the cohorts of newly-recruited 6-year-olds who had never previously received treatment decreased significantly over 2 years: 34.9% (95% CI 31.9\u201337.8%) to 22.6% (95% CI 19.9\u201325.2%) and 171.1 epg (95% CI 141.5\u2013200.7) to 72.0 epg (95% CI 50.9\u201393.1) for S. mansoni; and 48.4% (95% CI 45.4\u201351.5) to 15.9% (95% CI 13.6\u201318.2) and 232.7 epg (95% CI 188.4\u2013276.9) to 51.4 epg (95% CI 33.4\u201369.5) for hookworms, suggesting a general decline in environmental transmission levels.\\ud\n\\ud\nConclusion\\ud\n\\ud\nAnnual anthelminthic treatment delivered to schoolchildren and to adults at high risk in Uganda can significantly reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection for schistosomiasis and STH, and potentially also significantly reduce levels of environmental transmission of infection","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/220346.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/37719\/1\/Parasitological_impact_of_2-year_preventive_chemotherapy_on_schistosomiasis_and_soil-transmitted_helminthiasis_in_Uganda%28lsero%29.pdf","pdfHashValue":"51a3b7c6b42a0368d159743d4833f1f8446ace1e","publisher":"BioMed Central","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lse.ac.uk:37719<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2014-05-30T15:18:51Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      74797065733D4445505453:4C53452D5354<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/37719\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        Parasitological impact of 2-year preventive chemotherapy on schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Uganda<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Zhang, Yaobi<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Koukounari, Artemis<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Kabatereine, Narcis<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Fleming, Fiona<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Kazibwe, Francis<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Tukahebwa, Edridah<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Stothard, J Russell<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Webster, Joanne P.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Fenwick, Alan<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        DT Africa<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\n        RA Public aspects of medicine<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        Background\\ud\n\\ud\nSchistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are among the neglected tropical diseases in Africa.

More importantly, the prevalence and intensity of both S. mansoni and hookworm infections in the cohorts of newly-recruited 6-year-olds who had never previously received treatment decreased significantly over 2 years: 34.9% (95% CI 31.9\u201337.8%) to 22.6% (95% CI 19.9\u201325.2%) and 171.1 epg (95% CI 141.5\u2013200.7) to 72.0 epg (95% CI 50.9\u201393.1) for S. mansoni; and 48.4% (95% CI 45.4\u201351.5) to 15.9% (95% CI 13.6\u201318.2) and 232.7 epg (95% CI 188.4\u2013276.9) to 51.4 epg (95% CI 33.4\u201369.5) for hookworms, suggesting a general decline in environmental transmission levels.\\ud\n\\ud\nConclusion\\ud\n\\ud\nAnnual anthelminthic treatment delivered to schoolchildren and to adults at high risk in Uganda can significantly reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection for schistosomiasis and STH, and potentially also significantly reduce levels of environmental transmission of infection.<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>\n        BioMed Central<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>\n        2007<\/dc:date><dc:type>\n        Article<\/dc:type><dc:type>\n        PeerReviewed<\/dc:type><dc:format>\n        application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:language>\n        en<\/dc:language><dc:identifier>\n        http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/37719\/1\/Parasitological_impact_of_2-year_preventive_chemotherapy_on_schistosomiasis_and_soil-transmitted_helminthiasis_in_Uganda%28lsero%29.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n          Zhang, Yaobi and Koukounari, Artemis and Kabatereine, Narcis and Fleming, Fiona and Kazibwe, Francis and Tukahebwa, Edridah and Stothard, J Russell and Webster, Joanne P. and Fenwick, Alan  (2007) Parasitological impact of 2-year preventive chemotherapy on schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Uganda.

A national control program for these diseases was initiated in Uganda during March 2003. Annual\ntreatment with praziquantel and albendazole was given to schoolchildren in endemic areas and to adults in\nselected communities where local prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni in schoolchildren was high.\nMethods: The impact of the treatment program was monitored through cohorts of schoolchildren and adults.\nTheir infection status with S. mansoni and STH was determined by parasitological examinations at baseline and at\nannual follow-ups. The prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and STH before and after treatment were analyzed.\nResults: Two rounds of treatment significantly reduced the prevalence of S. mansoni infection in schoolchildren\nacross three regions in the country from 33.4\u201349.3% to 9.7\u201329.6%, and intensity of infection from 105.7\u2013386.8\neggs per gram of faeces (epg) to 11.6\u201384.1 epg. The prevalence of hookworm infection was reduced from 41.2\u2013\n57.9% to 5.5\u201316.1%, and intensity of infection from 186.9\u2013416.8 epg to 3.7\u201336.9 epg. The proportion of children\nwith heavy S. mansoni infection was significantly reduced from 15% (95% CI 13.4\u201316.8%) to 2.3% (95% CI 1.6\u2013\n3.0%). In adults, significant reduction in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and hookworm infections was\nalso observed. More importantly, the prevalence and intensity of both S. mansoni and hookworm infections in the\ncohorts of newly-recruited 6-year-olds who had never previously received treatment decreased significantly over\n2 years: 34.9% (95% CI 31.9\u201337.8%) to 22.6% (95% CI 19.9\u201325.2%) and 171.1 epg (95% CI 141.5\u2013200.7) to 72.0\nepg (95% CI 50.9\u201393.1) for S. mansoni; and 48.4% (95% CI 45.4\u201351.5) to 15.9% (95% CI 13.6\u201318.2) and 232.7 epg\n(95% CI 188.4\u2013276.9) to 51.4 epg (95% CI 33.4\u201369.5) for hookworms, suggesting a general decline in\nenvironmental transmission levels.\nConclusion: Annual anthelminthic treatment delivered to schoolchildren and to adults at high risk in Uganda can\nsignificantly reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection for schistosomiasis and STH, and potentially also\nsignificantly reduce levels of environmental transmission of infection.\nPublished: 3 September 2007\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:27 doi:10.1186\/1741-7015-5-27\nReceived: 18 April 2007\nAccepted: 3 September 2007\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/27\n\u00a9 2007 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/27Background\nSchistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by infection\nwith blood-fluke trematode schistosomes through contact\nwith infective larvae in aquatic habitats of poor hygiene\nand sanitation that contain freshwater snails, the para-\nsites' intermediate host. In Africa, two forms of human\nschistosomiasis occur: intestinal schistosomiasis due to\nSchistosoma mansoni and urinary schistosomiasis due to\nSchistosoma haematobium. By contrast, soil-transmitted\nhelminthiasis (STH) is caused by infection with a group of\nintestinal nematode worms, most importantly in much of\nsub-Saharan Africa, the hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides\nand Trichuris trichiura, through contact with parasite eggs\nor larvae that are present in the contaminated environ-\nment. Both schistosomiasis and STH are among the\nneglected tropical diseases that remain serious public\nhealth problems, posing unacceptable threats to human\nhealth and welfare, especially in the developing world. In\ntotal around 200 million people worldwide are estimated\nto be infected with schistosomes [1-3], and the numbers\nof STH infections are much greater [4-7]. The combined\nloss of 'disability-adjusted life years' due to the above par-\nasitic infections is 43.5 million [6-8], only ranking behind\nthose for lower respiratory infections (91.3 million), HIV\/\nAIDS (84.5 million), diarrhoeal diseases (62 million),\nand malaria (46.5 million) [9,10]. Moreover, the disabil-\nity-adjusted life years for schistosomiasis recently have\nbeen considered to greatly underestimate the true burden\nof the disease and are in need of reassessment [11-15].\nTherefore, the actual total burden of these parasitic infec-\ntions could be much greater. It is well documented that\nthese infections have a debilitating effect on people's\nhealth, especially children \u2013 the most vulnerable group.\nSchistosomiasis alone could be responsible for 200000\ndeaths per year in sub-Saharan Africa, and STH could be\nresponsible for 135000 deaths per year globally [14].\nDespite these facts, the control of these neglected tropical\ndiseases has not previously been given priority within the\nnational health programs of many of the sub-Saharan\nAfrican countries. The main reasons for this are, first, that\nmany of these parasitic infections can be asymptomatic\nand less overtly life-threatening than diseases such as HIV\/\nAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and, second, that the nec-\nessary anthelminthic drugs have been too expensive for\nwidespread use within countries with limited financial\nresources.\nIn Uganda, intestinal schistosomiasis has long been\nknown to be prevalent, being dominant in 38 out of 58\ndistricts within regions surrounding Lakes Victoria and\nAlbert and the Albertine Nile area [16-18]. While urinary\nschistosomiasis also occurs in Uganda, its distribution is\nconfined to a few isolated foci within central Uganda [18].\nRecent surveys conducted between 1998 and 2002\nshowed that 16.7 million people, out of a total popula-\ntion of 24 million people in 108 counties, were estimated\nto be at risk of infection with S. mansoni [18]. The level of\ninfection in the human population was closely related to\nthe proximity with local water bodies where daily water\ncontact activities such as washing and bathing occur.\nPlaces with the highest prevalence were closer to the\nimmediate shorelines of Lakes Victoria and Albert, and in\ncertain locations infections were nearly universal (100%)\n[18]. Hookworm infections tend to be widespread\nthroughout the country with a prevalence of up to 90%,\nwhile A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections tend to be\nmore geographically restricted, being greatest in the\nsouthwestern districts and to a lesser extent in central and\npart of eastern Uganda (up to 89% and 68%, respectively)\n[19-22]. Although some individual treatment projects had\nbeen carried out in certain areas of the country, the imple-\nmentation of the first systemic national control program\nfor schistosomiasis and STH was not initiated until 2003,\ndespite the fact that a very effective drug, praziquantel\n(PZQ), has been available for decades. The current pro-\ngram was made possible by the recent reduction in the\nprice of drugs [23] and the financial and technical support\nfrom the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, funded by the\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nBy the beginning of 2005, two rounds of annual mass\nchemotherapy with PZQ and albendazole (ALB) had been\ndelivered. Approximately 3.5 million schoolchildren and\ncommunity adults at high risk had received treatment.\nCohorts of schoolchildren and community adults were\nselected and followed-up annually to monitor the effect of\nthe control program. Previous analysis showed that the\ntreatment had significantly improved anaemia status,\nwhich was associated with schistosomiasis and hook-\nworm infections, and clinical manifestations in school-\nchildren [24,25]. The aim of the current paper is to assess\nin detail the significant impact of two rounds of mass\nchemotherapy in this control program upon the preva-\nlence and intensities of these parasitic infections in differ-\nent epidemiological settings, both on those treated\nindividuals and more importantly, also on the new\ncohorts of 6-year-old untreated children, potentially\nreflective of the subsequent transmission risk in the envi-\nronment.\nMethods\nNational control program\nThe Ugandan national control program for schistosomia-\nsis and STH was the first among the six in Africa supported\nby the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative. The control\nstrategies used were school-based mass chemotherapy in\nchildren and selective chemotherapy in adults at high risk\nof schistosome infection, together with health education,\nfollowing the World Health Organization guidelines [7].\nThe program started initially in 18 districts, which werePage 2 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/27known to have the highest prevalence of S. mansoni infec-\ntions (Figure 1). The treatment strategy for each commu-\nnity was decided according to its endemic category using\navailable epidemiological mapping data [18] and was\nbased on the schistosomiasis prevalence in the areas: (1)\nwhere schistosomiasis prevalence was over 50% (high cat-\negory), annual mass treatment was given to schoolchil-\ndren and community adults; (2) where schistosomiasis\nprevalence was 10\u201350% (medium category), annual mass\ntreatment was given to schoolchildren only; and (3)\nwhere schistosomiasis prevalence was below 10% (low\ncategory), schoolchildren were treated in the first two\nrounds of treatment only [7,23]. The details of the control\nstrategies and implementation of the program are\ndescribed elsewhere [26]. The dosage of PZQ was 40 mg\/\nkg body weight, co-administered with a single 400 mg\nALB tablet. PZQ tablets were procured from Shin Poong\n(Seoul, Korea) and ALB from GlaxoSmithKline (Brent-\nford, Middlesex, UK). The treatment received ethical clear-\nance from the National Health System Local Research\nEthics Committee of St Mary's Hospital, London as well as\napproval from the Ministry of Health and the National\nCouncil of Science and Technology, Kampala, Uganda.\nMonitoring cohorts and parasitological diagnosis\nIn order to monitor the impact of the treatment, identifi-\nable cohorts of schoolchildren and community adults\nwere recruited and examined at baseline and at follow-ups\n(Figure 2). The details of cohort selection and sample sizes\nwere described previously [24,27]. In brief, 37 primary\nschools in eight districts were selected for monitoring\nstudies, representing three different transmission regions,\nthe Albertine Nile region (Nebbi, Moyo, and Arua dis-\ntricts), the Lake Albert region (Hoima and Masindi dis-\ntricts), and the Lake Victoria region (Busia, Bugiri, and\nMayuge districts), and three endemic categories as\ndescribed above. Within each district, five schools were\nselected according to endemic categories: two from the\nhigh category, two from the medium category, and one\nfrom the low category, except that only one school was\nsurveyed in Arua, and six in Moyo due to logistical rea-\nsons. Within each school, 120 children were selected ran-\ndomly on the basis of age (6-, 7-, 8-, or 11-year-olds) to\ninclude approximately 15 boys and 15 girls in each age\ngroup. We also selected nine communities from eight dis-\ntricts where the initial prevalence in the school was high\n(>50%). Approximately 120 people over the age of 14\nwere recruited from each community on a voluntary basis.\nDiagram of the study structureFigure 2\nDiagram of the study structure.\nUgandan treatment program\n18 districts covered initially by the program\n3 transmission regions:\nAlbertine Nile: 3 districts\nLake Albert:  2 districts\nLake Victoria: 3 districts\n3 endemic categories:\nHigh category: S. mansoni prevalence >50% \nMedium category: S. mansoni prevalence 10-50%\nLow category: S. mansoni prevalence <10%\nHigh category: 2 schools + 1 community\nMedium category: 2 schools\nLow category: 1 school\nTotal 4351 children aged 6, 7, 8 or 11 in 37 schools recruited \nTotal 1006 adults aged over 14 in 9 communities recruited\nBaseline data collected\n1st mass treatment carried out \n1st follow-up carried out 12 months later\nSame cohort children + new 6 year old recruits\nSame cohort adults + new recruits due to drop-outs\n8 districts selected for monitoring studies\n2nd mass treatment carried out\n2nd follow-up carried out 24 months later\nSame cohort children + new 6 year old recruits\nSame cohort adults + new recruits due to drop-outs\nInterim data analysis\nMap of the initial program coverage areas and the cohort scho l location in UgandaFigure 1\nMap of the initial program coverage areas and the \ncohort school location in Uganda.

The same cohorts of children\nand adults, if traced, were re-examined 12 and 24 months\nlater, each in the same month of the year as when the\nbaseline survey was performed and before the next round\nof treatment taking place. At each follow-up an additional\n15 boys and 15 girls of 6 years of age were recruited from\neach school. Due to the high dropout rate in the adult\ncohorts, additional voluntary adults were examined in\neach community at each follow-up. On each occasion,\nfaecal samples from all individuals were examined using\nthe single modified Kato-Katz thick smear [28] for schis-\ntosomiasis and STH. The focal egg counts for each of the\nfour parasites were recorded, and the prevalence and\narithmetic mean intensity of infection (epg) including\nboth positive and negative individuals was calculated\n[29]. To minimize the measurement bias on the parasito-\nlogical data, all Kato-Katz slides were read within 2 h of\npreparation to avoid the degeneration of hookworm eggs,\nand 10% of the total slides were randomly selected and\nread by a second experienced microscopist for quality\ncontrol. Prior to each examination, written informed con-\nsents were obtained from each participant for adults and\nfrom head teachers for school children with verbal con-\nsents from parents.\nData management and analysis\nEach individual in the cohorts was given a specific, but\nanonymous, identification number. Once collected, all\ndata were computerized into the database according to\nthe identification numbers.

For adult data, as the majority of original adult\nrecruits could not be followed-up for the study period\n(very few have the three complete sets of longitudinal\ndata), the cross-sectional data from all adults examined at\neach visit were presented here. Frequency tables together\nwith 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using\nsoftware SAS v.8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nImpact on the prevalence and intensity of intestinal \nschistosomiasis in schoolchildren\nThe results are summarized in Table 1. The overall preva-\nlence was 42.4% at baseline. In different regions the Lake\nregions had a higher prevalence than the Albertine Nile\nregion (Table 1). The average prevalence was 77.2% in\nhigh category schools, 29.9% in medium category\nschools, and 2.1% in low category schools. The prevalence\nof schistosome infection was not significantly different\nbetween boys and girls (Table 1). After PZQ treatment, the\noverall prevalence was significantly reduced to 26.8%\nafter the first round of treatment and to 17.9% after the\nsecond round of treatment, a total reduction of 57.8%. In\ndifferent regions, a greater reduction (71%) was shown in\nthe Nile region than in the Lake Victoria region (58.2%)\nor in the Lake Albert region (40%). In different endemic\ncategories, the highest percentage reduction in prevalence\n(73.2%) was shown in the medium category schools,\nwhile the prevalence in high or low category schools was\nreduced by half. A similar degree of reduction in schisto-\nsome prevalence was observed in both genders after treat-\nments, as shown in Table 1.\nAt baseline, 15% of the children had heavy S. mansoni\ninfections (\u2265 400 epg), and the arithmetic mean intensity\nof infection of all participants was 219.6 epg (Table 1).\nThere was no significant difference in the mean intensities\nbetween the boys and the girls. In different regions, the\nhighest mean intensity of schistosome infection (386.8\nepg) was found in the Lake Albert region while the lowest\nmean intensity (105.7 epg) was recorded in the Albertine\nNile region. In schools of different endemic categories, the\nheaviest infection was in schools of high endemic cate-\ngory with an arithmetic mean intensity of 522.3 epg. After\ntwo rounds of PZQ treatment, the proportion of the heavy\ninfections with S. mansoni was reduced to only 2.3% at the\nsecond follow-up (Table 1). The overall arithmetic mean\nintensity of infection was reduced by 83%. Similar reduc-\ntion was observed in both boys and girls after treatment,\nwith a total reduction of 85.9% and 79.4% respectively at\nthe second follow-up. Although the percentage reduction\nin mean intensity looks higher in the Albertine Nile\nregion, the absolute reduction inepg in both lake regions\nwas much steeper: 300 epg (Lake Albert) and 200 epg\n(Lake Victoria), respectively. Similarly in different\nendemic categories, the most noticeable reduction inepg\nwas in schools of high category, by over 400 epg.\nImpact on the prevalence and intensity of intestinal \nschistosomiasis in community adults\nThe results for adults are from the cross-sectional data\n(Table 2). Overall prevalence of S. mansoni infection was\n57.4% at baseline, higher in males than in females. As in\nchildren, the prevalence of S. mansoni infection in adults\nin the Lake regions was higher than in the Albertine Nile\nregion (Table 2). Two rounds of treatment achieved a total\nreduction of 82.9% in the overall prevalence. There was\nno difference in prevalence between males and females\nafter two rounds of treatment. The prevalence in both gen-\nders was significantly reduced from baseline by 85.6% in\nmales and 79.5% in females. As in Table 2, the percentage\nreduction in three regions was 72.9% in the Lake Albert\nregion, 82.5% in the Lake Victoria region, and 85.8% in\nthe Albertine Nile region.\nIn these adults, 16.8% of population had heavy S. mansoni\ninfections, and the arithmetic mean intensity of infection\nwas 251.6 epg at baseline. Males were significantly more\nheavily infected than females. Generally speaking, those\nin the Lake Albert region were most heavily infected, and\nthose in the Albertine Nile region were least heavily\ninfected. As shown in Table 2, after two rounds of treat-\nment the arithmetic mean intensity of S. mansoni infec-\ntion was dramatically reduced to 19.6 epg, a reduction of\n92.2%. The proportion of heavy infections decreased to\nonly 1%. There was no difference in intensity of infection\nbetween males and females after two rounds of treatment,\nwith a greater degree of reduction shown in males.\nImpact on the prevalence and intensity of STH in \nschoolchildren\nThe overall prevalence of hookworm infection was 50.9%\nat baseline. It was slightly higher in the Lake Victoria\nregion than in the Albertine Nile region or in the Lake\nAlbert region, respectively (Table 3). There was no signifi-\ncant difference in prevalence of hookworm infection\nbetween boys and girls at baseline. After ALB treatment,\nthe overall prevalence was reduced to 24.1% after the first\ntreatment and to 10.7% after the second treatment,\nrespectively, representing a reduction of 79%. Substantive\ndecreases in prevalence were seen in all three regions, and\neven after one treatment the hookworm infection in the\nLake Albert and the Nile regions was reduced by over\n75%. Both boys and girls showed similar improvement in\nreducing prevalence of hookworm infections.\nMost of the hookworm infections were light infections at\nbaseline (<2000 epg) as in Table 3 with an estimatedPage 5 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/27arithmetic mean intensity of infection of 309.4 epg. There\nwas no significant difference in mean intensity between\ngenders, and the highest mean intensity was found\naround Lake Victoria (Table 3). After two rounds of treat-\nment with ALB, the arithmetic mean intensity of infection\nsignificantly decreased to 21.9 epg. The percentage reduc-\ntion in the mean intensity was similar between the gen-\nders and in the different regions; however, the absolute\nreduction in the mean intensity was much greater in the\nLake Albert and Lake Victoria regions, where the initial\nmean intensity was higher.\nThe prevalence of A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura was rela-\ntively low in the cohort areas (Table 3). The prevalence of\nA. lumbricoides was reduced from 2.8% to 0.6%, and the\nintensity of infection was reduced by 83%, however the\nimpact was negligible because of the very light infections\nin these areas. The prevalence of T. trichiura did not show\nmuch change, maintaining at around a 2% level, and\nthere was no significant change in the mean intensity of T.\ntrichiura infections either. Analysis of A. lumbricoides or T.\ntrichiura infection by different epidemiological settings\ndid not show any statistical differences, therefore, such\ndetails are not presented in this paper.\nImpact on the prevalence and intensity of STH in \ncommunity adults\nAt baseline, hookworm prevalence was 31.7%, and there\nwas no significant difference between males and females,\nas shown in Table 4. In contrast to schistosome infection,\nthe prevalence of hookworm infection was significantly\nlower in the Lake Albert region than in the Lake Victoria\nregion and in the Albertine Nile region. After two rounds\nof treatment, the prevalence decreased by 61.8% in total,\n68.2% in males, and 56.1% in females. Significant reduc-\ntion was shown in all three regions (Table 4).\nHookworm infections in adults were mainly light infec-\ntions (Table 4). Arithmetic mean intensity of infection\nwas 121.9 epg at baseline, and relatively heaviest infec-\ntions were seen in the Lake Victoria region among three\ndifferent regions. After two rounds of treatment, the inten-\nsity of infection decreased by a near 72% reduction in\ntotal. A significant reduction was observed in all three\nregions (Table 4). A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infec-\ntions were observed at a very low level (around 1%), and\nno significant impact was seen on these by the treatment.\nTable 2: S. mansoni prevalence and intensity of infection in the community adults before and after treatment (cross-sectional data)\nBaseline Follow-up Year 1 Follow-up Year 2 Overa\nll \nreduc\ntion\nPrevalence\nOverall prevalence (%) 57.4 (54.1\u201360.6) (n = 903) 34.7 (31.1\u201338.2) (n = 689) 9.8 (6.9\u201312.8) (n = 397) 82.9%\nRegions\nAlbertine Nile 43.1 (35.9\u201350.3) (n = 181) 16.1 (10.2\u201322.0) (n = 149) 6.1 (1.7\u201310.6) (n = 114) 85.8%\nLake Albert 65.6 (60.2\u201370.9) (n = 302) 42.9 (35.2\u201350.7) (n = 156) 17.8 (6.6\u201328.9) (n = 45) 72.9%\nLake Victoria 57.6 (52.9\u201362.4) (n = 420) 38.5 (33.7\u201343.4) (n = 384) 10.1 (6.3\u201313.9) (n = 238) 82.5%\nSex\nMale 64.6 (60.2\u201369.1) (n = 441) 40.1 (34.5\u201345.7) (n = 294) 9.3 (5.3\u201313.2) (n = 205) 85.6%\nFemale 48.2 (43.4\u201353.0) (n = 413) 28.5 (23.3\u201333.7) (n = 288) 9.9 (5.7\u201314.2) (n = 191) 79.5%\nIntensity of infection\nOverall\nMean epg 251.6 (213.7\u2013289.6) (n = 903) 80.4 (61.1\u201399.7) (n = 689) 19.6 (4.9\u201334.3) (n = 397) 92.2%\n0 epg (%) 42.6 (39.4\u201345.9) (n = 385) 65.3 (61.7\u201368.9) (n = 450) 90.2 (87.3\u201393.1) (n = 358) -\n1\u201399 epg (%) 23.7 (20.9\u201326.5) (n = 214) 19.3 (16.4\u201322.3) (n = 133) 6.8 (4.3\u20139.3) (n = 27) -\n100\u2013399 epg (%) 16.8 (14.4\u201319.3) (n = 152) 10.2 (7.9\u201312.4) (n = 70) 2.0 (0.6\u20133.4) (n = 8) -\n\u2265 400 epg (%) 16.8 (14.4\u201319.3) (n = 152) 5.2 (3.6\u20136.9) (n = 36) 1.0 (0.0\u20132.0) (n = 4) -\nRegion\nAlbertine Nile 67.6 (46.3\u201389.0) (n = 181) 31.0 (9.4\u201352.5) (n = 149) 2.5 (0.1\u20134.8) (n = 116) 96.3%\nLake Albert 411.2 (321.6\u2013500.7) (n = 302) 131.9 (74.9\u2013189.0) (n = 156) 62.0 (0.0\u2013167.6) (n = 48) 84.9%\nLake Victoria 216.2 (169.7\u2013262.6) (n = 420) 78.7 (54.5\u2013102.9) (n = 384) 18.4 (5.9\u201330.8) (n = 247) 91.5%\nSex\nMale 346.9 (285.0\u2013408.8) (n = 441) 101.8 (65.8\u2013137.9) (n = 294) 19.6 (0.0\u201344.4) (n = 205) 94.3%\nFemale 154.9 (107.6\u2013202.2) (n = 413) 69.2 (42.9\u201395.6) (n = 288) 19.7 (4.6\u201334.9) (n = 191) 87.3%\nFigures in () indicate 95% confidence interval; n, number of subjects in the group.Page 6 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/27Impact on potential transmission: prevalence and intensity \nof infection in new 6-year-old untreated cohorts\nCohorts of the 6-year-olds from each school were\nrecruited at baseline and at each of both follow-ups. These\nnew cohort children were the first year pupils who had not\nhad the history of previous treatment before they joined\nthe school. Any children indicating, during the question-\nnaire survey, that they might have received treatment were\nexcluded from analysis here. The data from these children\nshould provide an indicator for the transmission levels in\nthe areas. As shown in Table 5, at baseline, 34.9% of the\n6-year-old children were infected with S. mansoni, and\n48.4% infected with hookworms. After two rounds of\ntreatment the prevalence and intensity of both S. mansoni\nand hookworm infections in the untreated 6-year olds sig-\nnificantly decreased (Table 5). A greater reduction was\nshown in hookworm infections. Even after one treatment\na significant decrease was seen in both hookworm preva-\nlence and intensity of infection. Such reduction was\nprominent in all three different regions, with the highest\nreduction in both S. mansoni and hookworm infections in\nthe Albertine Nile region (Table 5).\nDiscussion\nBaseline data from 37 primary schools and nine commu-\nnities in eight districts illustrated the significant burden of\nschistosomiasis and STH in Uganda. Prevalence of S. man-\nsoni infection was nearly 100% in many schools, and 15%\nof children were heavily infected (\u2265 400 epg). Hookworm\ninfection was widespread in all areas, with an average\nprevalence of 50% in children.

The treatment coverage of school-aged\nchildren in our program has been shown to be well above\nthe 75% threshold [26]. Our data suggest that this has\nresulted in a remarkable reduction of the burden due to\nthese parasitic infections [24,25,27]. After two rounds of\ntreatment with PZQ and ALB, significant reduction was\nobserved in both prevalence and, more importantly,\nintensity of infection of S. mansoni and hookworms.\nTwo rounds of treatment in adults also showed a tremen-\ndous impact on the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni\nand hookworm infections. However, it was noticed that\nthe prevalence and intensity of hookworm infections were\nnot reduced after the first round of treatment. This might\nhave been due to the high dropout rate of adults from\nbaseline and the recruitment of additional (different)\nindividuals at follow-ups. It should also be noted that our\nadult data were obtained from the communities where the\noriginal S. mansoni prevalence in schoolchildren was high\n(>50%). Therefore, the adult data represent the situation\nonly in such areas.\nTo evaluate the potential longer-term impact of the pro-\ngram, we examined the infections in the 6-year-old chil-\ndren who had not received treatment previously as they\nhad only recently started attending school. It might be an\nimportant observation that both S. mansoni and hook-\nworm infections in this group of children significantly\ndecreased after two rounds of treatment (Table 5), sug-\ngesting that the level of environmental transmission in\nthese areas could have been reduced because of overall\nreductions in excreted eggs from infected children, or\nowing to altered contaminating behaviours of the chil-\ndren as health education activities concurrent with\nadministration of anthelmintics took place.

For schistosomiasis\na simple explanation is available: the Albertine Nile offers\nless convenient platforms for human water contact than\nthe shorelines of the lakes owing to the increased riverine\ncurrent and dangerously steep shelving banks.\nThe ultimate goal of the current control strategy recom-\nmended by the World Health Organization is to reduce\nthe morbidity due to schistosomiasis and STH. The conse-\nquence of these parasitic infections has been well studied\nand documented. Apart from the liver and spleen pathol-\nogy caused by intestinal schistosomiasis, anaemia, growth\nstunting, and cognitive impairment are also linked to\nthese infections [14,32,33]. Our data also showed a strong\nlink between anaemia and both S. mansoni and hook-\nworm infections [24]. By studying two neighbouring com-\nmunities in Uganda, Booth and colleagues showed that\nthe development of hepatosplenic morbidity due to S.\nmansoni can be critically related to the duration of expo-\nsure to S. mansoni infections [34]. Therefore, repeated\ntreatment as early in childhood as possible is particularly\nimportant to avoid the devastating consequences at a later\nstage of life [35]. And, indeed, one round of treatment has\nalready shown a sign of improvement in children's health\n[24]. Distended abdomen syndrome in schoolchildren, as\ndefined by an abdominal circumference ratio, was shown\nto likely improve after the first round of treatment [27].\nWith the program progressing, and more treatment and\nhealth education being delivered, long-lasting health ben-\nefits will undoubtedly be brought to Ugandan children.\nIn line with the previous data [21], infections with A. lum-\nbricoides and T. trichiura in the current study areas are rel-\nTable 5: Prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and hookworm infections in the newly-recruited cohorts of previously untreated 6-year-\nold children before and after treatment\nBaseline Follow-up Year 1 Follow-up Year 2 Overall reduction\nS. mansoni\nPrevalence (%)\nOverall 34.9 (31.9\u201337.8) (n = 1 \n018)\n27.7 (25.0\u201330.4) (n = 1 \n075)\n22.6 (19.9\u201325.2) (n = 961) 35.2%\nRegion\nAlbertine Nile 22.4 (17.9\u201326.9) (n = 330) 12.9 (9.5\u201316.4) (n = 371) 11.3 (7.9\u201314.6) (n = 346) 49.6%\nLake Albert 47.5 (41.3\u201353.6) (n = 255) 42.4 (36.7\u201348.1) (n = 288) 32.3 (26.3\u201338.4) (n = 229) 32.0%\nLake Victoria 37.0 (32.4\u201341.5) (n = 433) 30.8 (26.3\u201335.2) (n = 416) 26.9 (22.5\u201331.4) (n = 386) 27.3%\nIntensity of infection \n(epg)\nOverall 171.1 (141.5\u2013200.7) (n = 1 \n018)\n119.9 (92.1\u2013147.8) (n = 1 \n075)\n72.0 (50.9\u201393.1) (n = 961) 57.9%\nRegion\nAlbertine Nile 93.7 (53.4\u2013133.9) (n = 330) 42.7 (18.9\u201366.5) (n = 371) 10.8 (6.1\u201315.4) (n = 346) 88.5%\nLake Albert 152.9 (111.9\u2013193.8) (n = \n433)\n84.2 (55.9\u2013112.5) (n = 416) 86.2 (59.2\u2013113.3) (n = 386) 43.6%\nLake Victoria 302.3 (223.9\u2013380.7) (n = \n255)\n271.1 (182.7\u2013359.5) (n = \n288)\n140.6 (65.6\u2013215.6) (n = \n229)\n53.5%\nHookworms\nPrevalence (%)\nOverall 48.4 (45.4\u201351.5) (n = 1 \n018)\n24.7 (22.1\u201327.3) (n = 1 \n075)\n15.9 (13.6\u201318.2) (n = 961) 67.1%\nRegion\nAlbertine Nile 46.1 (40.7\u201351.4) (n = 330) 14.0 (10.5\u201317.6) (n = 371) 10.7 (7.4\u201314.0) (n = 346) 76.8%\nLake Albert 39.6 (33.6\u201345.6) (n = 255) 10.8 (7.2\u201314.4) (n = 287) 12.2 (8.0\u201316.5) (n = 229) 69.2%\nLake Victoria 55.4 (50.8\u201360.2) (n = 433) 43.6 (38.9\u201348.4) (n = 417) 22.8 (18.6\u201327.0) (n = 386) 58.8%\nIntensity of infection \n(epg)\nOverall 232.7 (188.4\u2013276.9) (n = 1 \n018)\n84.6 (63.6\u2013105.6) (n = 1 \n075)\n51.4 (33.4\u201369.5) (n = 961) 77.9%\nRegion\nAlbertine Nile 184.1 (137.2\u2013231.0) (n = \n330)\n39.7 (6.7\u201372.7) (n = 371) 27.8 (8.4\u201347.3) (n = 346) 84.9%\nLake Albert 171.0 (97.4\u2013244.7) (n = \n255)\n20.2 (9.6\u201330.8) (n = 288) 32.2 (4.5\u201359.8) (n = 229) 81.2%\nLake Victoria 306.0 (218.6\u2013393.4) (n = \n433)\n168.9 (124.9\u2013212.8) (n = \n416)\n84.0 (46.0\u2013122.0) (n = 386) 72.5%\nFigures in () indicate 95% confidence intervals; n, number of subjects in the group.Page 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:27 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/27atively low, and they appear to be more focally distributed\nin certain parts of the country and do not constitute a\nmajor health problem in our study areas. It is noticed\nfrom the present data that ALB efficacy at the current dose\nlevel (400 mg per person) was high on hookworms and\non A. lumbricoides in children, as the prevalence and inten-\nsity of both infections decreased significantly after treat-\nment. However, in agreement with previous reports by\nothers [36-38], this dose was ineffective for the treatment\nof T. trichiura. As the program progresses and treatment is\nextended to southwestern Uganda, where T. trichiura\ninfection rates could be as high as 100% (NK, unpub-\nlished data), a different treatment regimen, e.g., multiple\ntreatment with ALB, should be considered to achieve bet-\nter cure rates on T. trichiura [5,39].\nDespite the progress made, it was generally observed that\nin cohort schools close to lakeshores, the prevalence and\nintensity of S. mansoni infection remained relatively high\neven after two rounds of treatment (data not shown). This\ncould imply that transmission at these locations is persist-\nently at a high level, and special attention should be\ndevoted to such locations to bring about a further decline\nin transmission. However, a high treatment coverage rate\nis instrumental in controlling schistosomiasis transmis-\nsion [40]. Although a minimum 80% coverage in the\nschools has been achieved at any time point in this pro-\ngram, frequent migration of people particularly from the\nfishing communities, some of whom are from neighbour-\ning countries, and absence from school of some school-\naged children remain significant hurdles to the successful\nimplementation of the control program, particularly in\nterms of ensuring repeated treatment. A concerted action\nof all neighbouring countries to offer treatment in the\nneighbouring states would significantly improve the situ-\nation. The current implementation of the control program\nis being integrated with the national child health days in\nUganda, and this might also help to improve the treat-\nment coverage in school-aged children. An epidemiologi-\ncal remapping of the current endemic status of these\nparasitic infections amid the ongoing control program is\nnow being carried out. The results will enable Uganda to\nidentify those problem areas where transmission is per-\nsistently high so as to adjust the treatment strategy in each\ncommunity to further bring down the level of infections,\nhence morbidity. Efforts are also being made to find addi-\ntional funds to sustain the impact achieved in the long\nterm.\nConclusion\nThe current study has clearly demonstrated the significant\nimpact of a national control program in sub-Saharan\nAfrica at reducing the prevalence and intensity of schisto-\nsomiasis and STH and even potential environmental\ntransmission of these diseases. We therefore set an exam-\nple of successful implementation of a national control\nprogram to combat these important neglected tropical\ndiseases in underdeveloped countries.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAF obtained funding and was the principal investigator.\nJPW, JRS, and AF participated in the design of data collec-\ntion.
