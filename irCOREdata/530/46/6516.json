A key learning outcome for physiotherapy students is to be able to observe,\nanalyse and explain the sequence of normal anatomical movement patterns for the upper\nand lower limb. However, when there is a requirement for such learning to be practice-\nbased it is not always possible to provide students with the necessary resources for\nindependent study. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a Web-based\ntool that allows students to practise and test their human movement analysis skills\nindependently, at their own pace. The tool utilizes video clips of common muscle\nmovements and multiple-choice questions with dynamic feedback to promote under-\nstanding. The aims of the tool and its evaluation by a sample group of forty-five students\nis described Suggestions for future development are discussed\nIntroduction\nIt is a commonly accepted maxim of education that independent learning and directed\nstudy accommodate individual learning styles and allow students to acquire basic facts and\nprinciples. Such practices are increasingly desirable in the current educational climate as\nthey allow teaching staff to use valuable contact time to address higher cognitive skills.\nHowever, when there is a requirement for such learning to be practice-based it is not always\npossible to provide students with the necessary resources for independent study.\nIn teaching anatomy to health professionals, such as physiotherapists, it is desirable to\nfacilitate their understanding of function, rather than merely the ability to identify\nstructure. Carr, Shepherd and Ada (1995) stress the importance of a clear understanding of\n62\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nnormal functional movement. The ability to assess patient problems and develop a\ntreatment strategy is dependent on comparing adaptive dysfunctional movement patterns\nto the functional norm. The skill of normal movement analysis is thus a fundamental\nrequirement for physiotherapists in all clinical areas, as pathokinesiology is one of its main\nunderpinning theories (Rothstein, 1986). Watson (1999) suggests that breaking movements\ninto their component subsystems enables students to develop the skills to analyse\nproblems.\nThe application of movement analysis is therefore an obvious requirement in\nphysiotherapy, but other health professions also make use of these techniques. Williams-\nPedretti and Zoltan (1990) recommend that occupational therapists observe performance\n(with particular attention to motor and sensory integrative components) to evaluate\nphysical dysfunction. Kielhofner (1997) suggests that occupational dysfunction is multi-\ndimensional, but recognizes physical and motor capacity as factors which should be\nconsidered by occupational therapists. Meanwhile Snell (1995) notes that medical students\nneed to understand the functional organization of anatomical structures such as muscles\nand joints and how they control activities of the body so that accurate diagnosis, and\ntherefore effective treatment, is provided.\nThe desired learning outcome for this skill in the anatomy module (for first year BSc\nHonours undergraduate physiotherapists at the Robert Gordon University) complements\nthese suggestions: the student must be able to observe, analyse and explain the sequence of\nnormal anatomical movement patterns for the upper and lower limbs and trunk.\nStudents are currently taught basic anatomical facts through keynote lectures, demonstra-\ntions on cadavers and self-study CD-ROMs and workbooks. They are encouraged to\nunderstand and apply this knowledge through tutorials and practical classes. In movement\nanalysis classes, the students model for each other and demonstrate various functional\nmovements such as stepping, standing from sitting, pushing and throwing. The 'model'\nstudent performs each movement repeatedly and the students observe, describe and explain\nthe movements occurring at each joint and how they are produced. It is imperative that the\nstudents analyse exactly what they see; as each individual moves differently, there is no\ntextbook 'right' answer. As there are many movements and many variations, practice with\ndifferent models is essential.\nThe practical class setting traditionally provides these opportunities and allows the tutor to\ngive feedback, but it is also necessary for students to practise outside classes. French,\nNeville and Laing (1994) stress the importance of practice between teaching sessions, but\nrecognize that students may have to rely on internal or peer group feedback. An additional\ncomplicating factor is model tiredness, as this varies the movement with each repetition.\nVideos may help solve this problem and have thus been suggested as an adjunct to\nindividual practice (French et al., 1994).\nAt the Robert Gordon University, students are currently assessed on their anatomy\nthrough a written examination and a practical viva, which includes both a live model and\nvideo footage. Prior to the examination, students may request tutorials on the components\nof the module they wish to revise; they invariably choose movement analysis. A Movement\nAnalysis Tool was thus devised in order to support further and enhance independent study\nof this important skill by:\n63\nValerie Cooper and Mike McConneli Web-based learning tool for undergraduate health professionals\n\u2022 providing students with a model for practice;\n\u2022 providing students with feedback on their attempts at movement analysis;\n\u2022 supporting students' understanding of the process with additional information.\nThe tool is thus intended to engage the students' attention via interactive and visually\nstimulating elements such as MCQs, video clips, animations and graphics, but also to\nprovide added value in the form of dynamic feedback and glossaries of muscles and\nmovements.\nThe Movement Analysis Tool\nThe Movement Analysis Tool presents muscle movements for the upper and lower limbs,\nand is accessed via a Web browser. The tool is divided into sections, each detailing a\nparticular muscle movement. Each section is prefaced by a video clip of a model\ndemonstrating the movement. Video clips of the movement are available in two formats:\nanimated GIFs, which are embedded in the Web pages and load automatically; or high-\nquality MPEG clips which are accessible via hypertext links. Below the clips in each\nsection, a series of multiple-choice\/multiple-response questions is presented which tests\nstudents on their knowledge of the starting, intermediate and finishing positions, the\nmuscles producing the movement and the type of muscle work. When students have chosen\nresponses, they submit them by clicking a button. The server 'marks' the questions and\nprovides individualized feedback related to the students' responses, including a\npersonalized cumulative score. If students answer questions incorrectly, feedback includes\na link to the relevant glossary, which permits them to find the correct muscles or identify\nattachments to discover where they went wrong.\nHTML was used to create the Movement Analysis Tool. The online assessment application\nsuite Question Mark Perception was also used. In addition to offering a variety of question\ntypes, Perception includes sophisticated and customizable reporting facilities which can\ndetail individual or aggregate scores, allowing for instantaneous feedback and marking as\nmentioned, and tracking of student behaviour. As any HTML content may be combined\nwith questions generated.by the application, hypertext links and multimedia content are\neasily incorporated. It was thus easy to provide links to other pages such as the glossaries,\nas part of the feedback. HTML tags were also used to include the animations.\nAnimations for the Movement Analysis Tool were captured from the original videotape\nand converted to MPEG and AVI format using an MPEG encoder. AVI files were broken\ndown into individual frames, converted to GIFs and reassembled as animations. Animated\nGIFs were used for two reasons: they provide a significant saving on file size compared\nwith MPEG and, unlike MPEG, they can be embedded in the question pages. However,\nanimated GIF files do not provide the same degree of resolution as MPEGs, nor can they\nbe easily paused and restarted. It was thus decided to retain the option to display MPEGs\nin the finished tool, via separate hypertext links. This allows students to play the MPEGs,\nstop and start them as they wish, and resize them as necessary, using Microsoft's Media\nPlayer. As students access the tool over the University Intranet, file size was, in this\ninstance, not deemed to be especially problematic.\n64\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nFigure I: Students' attitudes to\ntechnology pre- and post-pilot\n40-\n35-\n30-\n25-\nNumber of\nStudents\n20-\n15-\n10-\n5-\n0\n\"I11\nmn||Bn\n\\\nII\n-i\n1\nV\n1\n111\n1\nt\nI\nQ Pre Test\nB Post Test\niiiii.niiiii\nIHIIHI\nHim i\nAbllty\nEvaluation\nA pilot study of the tool was conducted using a sample of forty-five second-year physio-\ntherapy students. Second-year students were selected as they were deemed to have the\nnecessary anatomical knowledge to use the tool and would, moreover, understand the\ncontext for its use. The students were given an introductory session on how to use the tool\nand then divided into four groups. This ensured that they had adequate space and allowed\ntechnical and tutor support to be given as required. This reflected normal practice, as\nstudents would usually be given support from the tutor during their first session with a new\nlearning tool, until they were confident enough to use the tool independently.\nBrief pre- and post-session questionnaires were administered in order to assess students'\nlevels of confidence about the subject matter, and their attitude towards technology.\nAttitudes about layout, navigation and content were assessed via Likert scales, but open-\nended responses were also included for further details and to accommodate unanticipated\nreactions\/responses. The pre-test questionnaire was administered during a brief intro-\nductory session. Students then spent thirty supervised minutes using the tool, before\n65\nValerie Cooper and Mike McConnell Web-based learning tool for undergraduate health professionals\nn=45\nNavigation\nClear where you can go in Web pages n=43\nEasy to get to where you want to go\nEasy to bring up images and definitions\nEasy to work out what is already completed n=44\nLayout\nEasy to read text\nEasy to view graphics\nEasy to locate other information\nContent\nStyle of writing is suitable\nComplexity of content is suitable\nAmount of content \/ length is suitable\n1\n6\nII\n18\n10\n30\n18\n13\n32\n24\n22\n2\n18\n23\n18\n26\n15\n17\n20\n12\n15\n18\n3\n16\n9\n7\n6\n1\n7\n8\n2\n6\n4\n4\n2\n2\n1\n1\n0\n2\n3\n0\n0\n0\n5\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\nn=number of respondents\nFigure 2: Students'attitudes to tool characteristics\ncompleting the post-test questionnaire. Data were collected anonymously so that students\nwould be candid in their comments about the materials.\nConfidence levels in using IT for learning, and general knowledge of movement analysis\nbefore and after use of the tool are presented in Figure 1. Although the students surveyed\nwere familiar with movement analysis from the first year of their course, many stated that\nthey had forgotten elements over the summer, and needed to practise further. As can be\nseen from the chart, after the test an increase in student confidence had occurred, with\nthirty-one (69 per cent) students reporting an overall improvement in their confidence in\nthe subject and the use of Web-based learning, eleven (24 per cent) reporting the same\nlevels of confidence and only two students reporting a decrease in confidence. One of these\nlatter students, however, attributed her decrease in confidence to an increased awareness of\nhow much she had forgotten, so this was not considered a failing of the tool.\nFigure 2 presents student attitudes towards characteristics of the tool (namely navigational\naspects, layout and content), assessed via a Likert scale, where 1 indicates a well designed\naspect and 5 indicates a poorly designed aspect. Very few negative attitudes were recorded,\nand some of the negative feedback related to graphics may be attributable to poor network\nperformance during the'course of one of the pilot sessions.\nStudents were then asked to comment on a series of attitudinal statements about the Web\nmaterials. Results are summarized in Figure 3, and again indicate generally positive\nattitudes towards the tool.\nStudents were asked to state the main advantages and disadvantages of using the Web-\nbased materials for learning, and the three most commonly identified advantages and dis-\nadvantages are listed in Figure 4. It is encouraging to note that the biggest disadvantage was^\na generic problem with the network on the day and therefore not attributable to the tody\n66\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nEnjoyable to use\nHelps you learn about the subject\nWorth the time spent on it\nWould help me to revise the subject\nI would use it again in my own time\nWill help me with future study in this discipline\n7\n24\n21\n26\n12\n16\n26\n16\n16\n14\n26\n22\n10\n3\n3\n2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n1\n4\n1\n0\n0\n0\n3\n0\nI =strongly agree, 2=agree, 3=neutral, 4=disagree, 5=strongfy disagree\nfigure 3:Auitudmal statements about the tool\nADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES\nFeedback - twenty-three students (51 per cent) Problems with network and logins - eleven students\n(24 per cent)\nEasy access to resource - fourteen students Lack of tutor support - four students (8 per cent)\n(3 per cent)\nIndividual use - fourteen students (31 per cent) Less keen if lack skills or desire to use computer - three\nstudents (6 per cent)\nfigure 4: Perceived advantages and disadvantages of using the tool\nSimilarly, students were asked to list their favourite and least favourite aspects of the tool.\nThe three most common responses are listed in Figure 5 and reflect the advantages and\ndisadvantages.

However, a large corpus of research exists in the biomedical\nsciences which suggests that computer-based learning can be at least as effective as\ntraditional independent study. It is evident that students tested during the pilot had a\ngenerally positive attitude towards the technology, a factor regarded as impacting\nsignificantly on successful uptake by Gunn and Maxwell (1996) in a similar study. This\ncomplements other research which suggests that physiotherapy students, occupational\ntherapy students (Williams, Agho and Holm, 1996) and nursing students (Saranto, 1998;\nCohen and Dacany, 1994) have a positive attitude to computer-based learning and desire to\nincrease their knowledge and skills in this area. It will therefore be important to ensure that\nfuture use of the tool by students on other health courses is underpinned by sound training\nin basic C&IT skills.\nComments revealed that students welcomed the tool as an aid to independent study,\nprovided it was in addition to, and not supplanting, the tutor-supported practical sessions.\nBrain, Dewhurst and Williams (1999), conducting a similar evaluation for CBL tool in\npharmacology, found similar attitudes amongst their pilot group. There may be a reluctant\nadoption of learning technologies in health-related courses as they are traditionally\npractice-based. Arguably, students may be concerned that a computer simulation of\nclinical practice will not adequately prepare them for real patient situations, and they\nprefer to trust the clinical experience of tutors. Nevertheless, such attitudes can change:\nLeathard and Dewhurst (1995) report that medical students found CBL an acceptable\nalternative to live demonstrations. Although Brudenell and Carpenter (1990) report\nnegative attitudes to their CBL tool post-test, they suggest that one of the responsible\nfactors could be that subject expectations were not met. In the current study the increased\nconfidence evident amongst the pilot group after the test, suggests that these needs were\nmet, as comments made by the students relate directly to the course objectives.\nClearly, although the positive results are encouraging, it is important to remember that the\nsuccess of the tool (as with all learning technologies) will depend on its effective integration\ninto the module, and an assurance that students will have access to help and support from\nthe teaching team as they need it. As noted above, this tool is intended to be supportive,\nnot supplantive, of tutor-led practical sessions.\nFuture developments\nThe Movement Analysis Tool will be extended during next year to include a full library of\nnormal movements. If students continue to utilize the tool for their study, it is hoped in due\ncourse to add case studies of specially filmed dysfunctional movements which would\n68\nALT-] Volume 8 Number I\nintegrate into higher levels of the course. This would enable the tool to become a\nprogressive learning theme throughout the entire degree course. It would also allow\nstudents to practise their analysts of dysfunctional movement before they undertake their\nclinical placement.\nThe positive response to the tool from students during the pilot would seem to indicate that\nthe tool did achieve the aims specified above. If an effective methodology can be devised it\nwill be interesting to see how, if at all, the tool affects students' performance in exams.\nThe tool was demonstrated at two conferences last year - ALT-C 99 and CAL 99. A\nconsiderable amount of interest was generated, not just from other HE institutions, but\nalso from sports colleges and other teaching practitioners. There is thus the potential for\nthe tool to be shared nationally or made available commercially. This would give other\nclinicians the opportunity to contribute to the content and thus develop the tool on a\nnational or regional basis.\nReferences\nBrain S., Dewhurst, D. G. and Williams, A. D.
