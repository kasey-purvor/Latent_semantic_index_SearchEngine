Through years of experience in face-to-face teaching, faculty members have\ngenerated a great deal of knowledge and skill, which is often characterized by auto-\nmatic routines and tacit knowledge. The advent of the web and the growing online\neducation industry is transforming this context. It requires new course design proce-\ndures to represent and teach content in new contexts. It requires the use of new tools,\nas well as the creation and transformation of artifacts. It also poses new problems that\nrequire new kinds of support and collaboration since faculty members may lack the\ntechnical ability to create their own online classes.\nThe activity of designing an online course is situated within a larger web of institu-\ntional, individual and technological contexts that may be different from those\nrequired to design and teach face-to-face courses. These new stakeholders may hold\ndifferent goals, intentions, motivations and tools, as well as different rules (both\nimplicit and explicit) for how they typically complete certain tasks. According to\nBruce (1993), change often reflects situation-specific compromises between the old\n*Corresponding author. 509A Erickson Hall, East Lansing, MI 48824-1034, USA. \nEmail: punya@msu.eduISSN 0968\u20137769 (print)\/ISSN 1741\u20131629 (online)\/04\/010037\u201313\n\u00a9 2004 Association for Learning Technology\nDOI: 10.1080\/0968776042000211520\n 38\n \nL. Peruski & P. Mishra\n     and the new ways of doing things. The participants interpret and then re-create the\nactivity as they adapt it to fit with institutional and physical constraints, and with\ntheir own goals and practices. One of the goals of this study was developing a better\nunderstanding of this process of negotiation and interpretation. We also wanted to\nunderstand whether engaging in the new activity changed participants\u2019 thinking about\nlarger issues of course design, teaching and learning, such as content representation,\nthe role of teachers and the needs and requirements of students. Furthermore, we\nwanted to know whether the institution of new, collaborative work activities would\nchange work processes and systems in any way.\nMuch of the existing research on online teaching focuses on issues such as how the\ncourse is implemented, the nature of the interaction between faculty and students and\nevaluation of learner outcomes (Bolanger & Jordan, 2000; Mehrotra et al., 2001;\nWilliams, et al., 1999). Specifically, a lot of the research (particularly in the area of\ncomputer mediated communication) tends to focus on particular technologies, such\nas different kinds of discussion or chat software, and how these are instantiated within\nan online class. Less emphasis has been given to the experiences of faculty members\nworking collaboratively with others to develop and teach online courses and whether\nthese activities change their thinking about larger issues of teaching, learning and\ntechnology. Consequently, we have little knowledge of how the interactions between\nvarious stakeholders may lead to changes in work processes and thinking across\ngroups and individuals.\nThe approach to understanding phenomena in this study was inspired by activity\ntheory, particularly the work of Engestr\u00f6m (1999, 2000a, 2000b). When looking at\nparticipants\u2019 learning and change processes in organizational settings, Engestr\u00f6m\nbased his analysis on contradictions that occur within and between surrounding\nactivities. Contradictions may occur between systems that have different goals,\nresponsibilities and accountability, or there may be contradictions in how tools,\nobjects and subjects are seen. Contradictions may also arise because individuals are\nconcurrently members of multiple communities with different objects, tools and\nsocial relations. People must thus adjust roles, beliefs and actions to resolve conflicts\nthat may exist within and between systems (Jonassen, 2000).\nAccording to Hasu and Engestr\u00f6m (2000, p. 65), \u201ccontradictions manifest them-\nselves in disturbances and breakdowns in work processes as well as workers\u2019 innovative\nattempts to solve them\u201d. Disturbances and breakdowns refer to disruptions in the\nnormal functioning of things forcing individuals to adopt a more reflective or deliber-\native stance toward ongoing activity (Bodker & Gronbaek, 1998; Winograd & Flores,\n1986). The importance of contradictions is that, although learning can be deliberate,\ncontradictions can also be openings for learning, for transformations in thinking and\nwork processes and for systemic change.\nIn this study, we followed three faculty members involved in designing and teach-\ning their first online course. There were two main research questions: \n1. What contradictions and disturbances emerge during the activities of designing\nand teaching an online class?\n Webs of activity in online course design and teaching\n \n39\n        2. Does participating in these activities transform the thinking of the participants or\nthe systems on issues such as course design, teaching, learning, technology, and\nface-to-face teaching?\nThe activity systems\nWe begin by describing the multiple activity systems involved in helping the faculty\nmembers develop and teach their courses. These included the college, a faculty\ndevelopment class and the \u2018virtual university\u2019 (VU), a unit at the university level\ncharged with administering online courses. Note that all names used in this study are\npseudonyms.\nThe college\nIn 1999, a college within a large midwestern university created a new online\nmaster\u2019s degree program. In order to support faculty members in the creation of\ntheir online courses, the college offered a range of incentives and services to faculty\nmembers. These included a $10,000 stipend and faculty seminars. In addition, the\ncollege also created a faculty development course. The idea was that although most\nfaculty members had well-developed skills surrounding pedagogy, learning, and\ncourse design, they were less proficient technologically. The college asked two of its\neducational technology faculty members to create a course to teach their less tech-\nnologically-proficient colleagues how to develop their own online courses. (One of\nthe individuals who taught this course is the second author of this paper.)\nThe faculty development class\nThe faculty development class was a graduate course where students enrolled for\ncredit towards their master\u2019s degree in educational technology. Faculty members,\nwho were designing online courses that they would be teaching in the near future,\nvolunteered to be a part of this class. Students enrolled in the course and worked\ncollaboratively with faculty members to help them design online courses. The\nstudents often provided the technology expertise while the faculty members provided\nthe course content. However, individuals often took on overlapping responsibilities as\nthe course progressed. The faculty took on greater responsibility for decision making\nrelating to technology while the students offered insights into issues related to course\nstructure and content. (See Koehler et al., 2004, and Mishra & Koehler, 2003 for\nmore information on the dynamics of the faculty development class.) Two of the three\nfaculty members in this study, Jim and Juliet enrolled in the class. They worked\nclosely with the technology to develop a mock-up of their course website. The third\nfaculty member, Mikala, did not take the faculty development course and instead\nused her stipend to form her own student advisory group. Subsequently, all three took\ntheir courses to the VU who then hosted them.\n 40\n \nL. Peruski & P. Mishra\n        The virtual university\nThe VU is an independent unit at the university level whose job it is to help faculty\nteach online. Individual faculty members are responsible for developing the content\nof the course while the VU staff (designers and programmers) develop the technology\nand host the courses on their servers. VU staff have developed a series of software\nmodules (a discussion board, chat rooms, file uploading facilities, etc.) that can be inte-\ngrated into different courses. The VU assign a producer to coordinate the VU person-\nnel (designers\/programmers) and the faculty member teaching the course. The\nproducer integrated the content provided by the faculty member with the tools made\navailable by the VU technical staff and assisted the instructors in creating a course\ndesign, an aesthetic and a navigational structure for the course (Koehler et al., 2004).\nResearch method\nParticipants\nThe three faculty members in our study (Jim, Juliet and Mikala) were all faculty\nmembers in different departments at the College of Education. All were preparing to\nteach online courses for the first time. Each had years of experience (approximately\n10 years) in teaching face-to-face courses in a higher education setting. Though the\nthree online courses designed by the faculty members differed in their content, they\nhad certain similarities. All three were discussion-based and involved students\nworking in small groups to complete course objectives. The other participants in our\nstudy included a producer from the virtual university and a graduate student who\nworked with Mikala.\nData Sources\nWe used a case study approach to follow the three faculty members as they designed\nand taught their first online courses. The range of data collected for analysis included:\nmultiple interviews with the three faculty members and others who worked with the\nfaculty members on the project; artefacts created by the course design groups; and\ndirect observations during both the course development and teaching activities. In\nthis paper, we will look primarily at the interview data, which we describe below.\nWe interviewed each faculty member three times: first, during the design process;\nthen around halfway through their teaching; and finally, after the course ended. The\nfirst interview gathered professional and technical background, data on how the\nfaculty members carried out the course design activity, their perceptions about it,\nwhat they learned and data regarding their interactions with others and with the\ntechnology during the activity. The second interview focused on the faculty member\u2019s\nexperience teaching the online class, their interactions with others (e.g. online\nstudents, the VU producer, and the VU system, etc.), their interactions with the\ntechnology and the course content and what they had learned from their activities so\nfar. The final interview was a reflection on their experience of designing and teaching\n Webs of activity in online course design and teaching\n \n41\n        the online course, their interactions with people, systems and technology during these\nactivities and what they had learned.\nWe also interviewed the VU producer who had worked with both Jim and Juliet.\nThe producer was interviewed four times. The VU producer who worked with Mikala\ndeclined to participate in this study. Therefore, we interviewed Mikala\u2019s student\nassistant who had worked closely with Mikala and the VU producer throughout the\ndesign and implementation phases of the course. All interviews were semi-structured,\ninvolving open-ended questions. The interviews were structured to capture the partic-\nipants\u2019 points of view on their experience and to identify contradictions, disturbances\nand transformations in thinking.\nData analysis\nWe reviewed the transcribed interviews multiple times to get a holistic conception of\nthe content, to find instances that related to our study questions and to uncover unan-\nticipated side issues. Subsequently, we created a chart for each faculty member into\nwhich we plugged data summarised from interviews and from supporting data sources\nthat related to our study questions. We also created a cross-case chart to look across\nfaculty members. We used the charts to develop the case studies and the cross-case\nanalysis with a focus on the contradictions, disturbances and transformations that\noccurred during the activities of creating and teaching an online class. Though we\ndeveloped detailed cases studies of each individual, as well as a cross-case analysis, we\nreport just on the cross-case analysis in this paper. (See Peruski, 2003, for a complete\nreport.) This cross-case analysis highlights the contradictions and disturbances that\narose as each of the faculty members created and taught their online courses. Following\nthis, we discuss the transformations that occurred in the individuals and systems, as\nwell as implications of the study.\nResults: contradictions and disturbances\nA new context for teaching\nAll of the faculty members were experts in the course content and in designing and\nteaching face-to-face classes. The activity of designing and teaching face-to-face\nclasses represents standard work activities for faculty members. Hasu and Engestr\u00f6m\n(2000) describe standard work actions as \u201cprocedural steps that follow the script of a\ndisturbance-free \u2018normal\u2019 process. Disturbances are analyzed as deviations from this\nscripted procedure\u201d (p. 65; italics in the original). We argue that the new context for\nteaching (online) represented a deviation from each faculty member\u2019s normal script\n(designing and teaching face-to-face classes). Designing a course for a new context\nled the faculty members to question their role as teachers. \nThe surprising thing was how it tested and questions my own confidence as a teacher and\nreally what teaching is all about anyway. What are you really doing when you are teaching?\nWhat is the value of your contribution in the whole thing? I don\u2019t know. (Jim, interview,\n18 December 2001)\n 42\n \nL. Peruski & P. Mishra\n     The faculty members also had fears about their ability to teach in the new context and\ntwo of them wondered if they would enjoy it as much as their face-to-face teaching.\nThese revelations were significant given the fact that all three of the faculty members\nhad had extensive experience in teaching face-to-face. They indicated that merely\nparticipating in designing and teaching in the new online context led them to rethink\nand re-evaluate issues that they had long since put to rest in the face-to-face context.\nThe faculty development class and the VU\nAccording to the VU script, the faculty member was responsible for developing the\ncontent while the VU staff developed the technology including the visual interface\nand the navigational structure. Thus the VU model treated the technology as separate\nfrom the pedagogy. Furthermore, the VU used idiosyncratic technologies developed\nin-house, which were not compatible with standard commercial software. VU\nproducers had little training in curriculum and instructional design. They were more\nused to creating online lecture courses as opposed to interactive courses such as the\nones proposed by the faculty members.\nSuch divisions of labour made pragmatic sense for financial and scheduling reasons.\nFurthermore, not all faculty members were intrinsically interested in learning about\ntechnology, seeing it as a waste of time (Koehler et al., 2004). However, the divisions\nof labour, rules and idiosyncratic technology often limited the design options for faculty\nmembers. As a result, producers often made decisions that could have unintended\npedagogical consequences. Most VU courses have a standardised look and do not\nreflect the unique visions and styles of the faculty members (Mishra & Koehler, 2003).\nThe faculty development course, on the other hand, asked faculty members to\ndevelop their own courses in their own ways, and to take more control over these\nactivities. This often led to conflict with the goals of VU. In the course, faculty\nmembers worked with graduate students to create a mock-up of the online course.\nThe design teams were also introduced to a variety of technologies and design options\nnot available from the VU. Faculty members designed unique courses that fit with\ntheir personal and pedagogical goals and styles. In contrast to this, courses designed\nby the VU had less creativity and usually replicated courses that came before. The\ninstructors for the faculty development class hoped that their customisable approach\nwould encourage the VU to update their technology by virtue of having knowledge-\nable faculty members make more demands on the VU to create unique courses.\nHowever, this contradiction between the VU and the faculty development course\n(uniformity versus individualization of design) led to disturbances between faculty\nmembers and VU producers.\nAnother source of contradiction concerned the kinds of tools used in the faculty\ndevelopment course and the manner in which they were conceptualised. The faculty\ndevelopment course introduced the design teams to Blackboard (a commercial\ncourse management system) for use in developing the mock-ups of their online\ncourse websites. However, Blackboard was only one instantiation of what an online\ncourse website could look like. Blackboard is a highly integrated environment that\n Webs of activity in online course design and teaching\n \n43\n    also comes with an extensive suite of additional tools for student tracking, creating\nassessments and so on. Unlike Blackboard, the VU system was not an integrated\nsystem and it had a limited set of widgets that could be mixed and matched based on\nthe requirements of a course. Hence the VU system had a very different design\napproach than Blackboard. Moreover, some of the tools that were integrated within\nBlackboard were not available from the VU. Having used Blackboard in the faculty\ndevelopment course, the faculty members may have assumed that such tools and\nadd-ons would be available on any online teaching platform and thus they based\ntheir vision of their course on the availability of these tools.\nFor instance, Jim asked the VU for a tool to keep track of which students were\nonline and when they were there. Although the VU had no such tool, the VU\nproducer developed one, but was prevented from using it by his superiors due to\nconcerns about human subjects\u2019 clearance. In some fundamental sense, differing\nviews of what tools should be available created this entire disturbance. Jim felt that as\nan instructor he had the right to know which students were online and when. That\nwas one way to assess participation. The producer\u2019s responsibility was to help the\nfaculty member achieve his goals and thus created a widget to do that. However, the\nVU management saw looming ethical and legal issues regarding student privacy and\ndid not allow the tool to be used.\nAside from the differences in tools between the VU and the faculty development\nclass, the faculty members also spent time learning about and experimenting with a\nvariety of course designs. They learned how to integrate their desire for highly inter-\nactive, discussion-based and writing intensive courses into the online environment. In\nsummary, the faculty members took over control for most of the course design,\naesthetics and navigational structures, which was often something that the VU\nproducer controlled. Therefore, when the faculty members took their courses to the\nVU, they upset the usual divisions of labour. \nThe problem is we\u2019re a very centralized programming and server administration unit that\neverything has to go through and because of that, I can\u2019t use one thing for one class and\nuse another thing for another class. I have to use one thing for all of them so that does cause\nsome problems. (VU producer, interview, 20 December 2001)\nJim and Juliet, who took the faculty development course, deviated from the VU script\nby creating their own mock-ups of their courses instead of leaving that job to the VU\nproducer. Jim also brought along several of his design team members that he\nhad worked with in the faculty development class to work with the VU producer.\nThus, the deviations from the usual divisions of labour and course structures led to\ndisturbances as explained by the VU producer. \n(Jim) had two people working with him who had an idea of how they thought it should be\nand I always got the picture from them that they didn\u2019t trust, they didn\u2019t think that I knew\nwhat I was doing and Jim was more willing to trust them than he was to trust me. (VU\nproducer, interview, 20 December 2001)\nThe VU producer also referred to the contradictions between the VU system and the\nfaculty development class. \n 44\n \nL. Peruski & P. Mishra\n          Working with (Jim\u2019s) graduate assistants that had different ideas on how things should be\ndone (was a problem). The design is one, they\u2019re used to working outside the VU system.\nThere\u2019s a certain amount of tools that we use at VU and people who are outside VU [have]\nbecome accustomed to working within other systems and it was really hard to get them to\nsee that we need to mould things into our system. (VU producer, interview, 20 December\n2001)\nThese disturbances were also frustrating for Jim. He was convinced that the VU\nsystem needed to change, and that instead of relying on the VU he needed to become\nmore adept with the technology to achieve his goals. \nThe technology piece was just an irritant and that was a constant. The VU technology seems\nantiquated and cumbersome. I think there are a number of areas where VU needs to be\nmuch more supportive to make this online thing go. (Jim, interview, 18 December 2001)\nLike Jim, Juliet also took the faculty development class where she created a mock-up\nof her online course. Her course was also designed to be highly interactive and it was\nstructured in a way that the VU producer found confusing. Although the producer\nsuggested changes to Juliet\u2019s site, she was resistant to most of his suggestions. Thus,\nJuliet co-opted more of the control over the design activity than was typical in the VU\nscript. As a result, several disturbances emerged between Juliet and her VU producer\nthat could be traced to contradictions between the VU and the faculty development\nclass. In Juliet\u2019s course, neither the graphic nor the navigational structures fit the VU\nproducer\u2019s vision or the traditional VU philosophy about how online courses should\nbe designed. However, since one of his responsibilities was to satisfy Juliet, he\nworked with her original design but faced many difficulties organising navigation\nthrough the site. \nIt wasn\u2019t the prettiest site (compared to) other courses that have a more streamlined\ndesign. There were graphics that didn\u2019t need to be there. There\u2019s a rule in design that if\nyou can take it out of the design and everything still looks good then you don\u2019t need to\nhave it in there. In (Juliet\u2019s) design, there\u2019s stuff that could get trimmed but it didn\u2019t. (VU\nproducer, interview, 11 September 2001)\nAlthough the producer had made minor changes to the course, the course structure\nwas still unfamiliar to him, which led to additional disturbances. \nI changed around a few things. I added icons. Building the course was very confusing to\nme and it\u2019s my fault. It was wonderful for the students because it was really easy for them\nto get places but the way that I structured it; it was an organizational nightmare. It\u2019s not\nlinear\u2026whereas (other courses are linear). (VU producer, interview, 11 September 2001)\nThough the producer blamed himself for the problems, they could also be linked to\nthe contradictions between the faculty development class and the VU. The VU\nproducer also believed that his lack of knowledge of teaching methods and curriculum\ndesign were a problem. \n(It\u2019s) that gap of, I know how to do Web stuff and you know how to teach so let\u2019s get\ntogether and pool both. (VU producer, interview, 25 July 2001)\nIn contrast to Jim and Juliet, Mikala did not take the faculty development class. She\nfollowed the usual VU script by developing her content and taking it to a VU\n Webs of activity in online course design and teaching\n \n45\n      producer who used the available technological tools to put the course online.\nAlthough Mikala was satisfied with the VU system, one disturbance arose, which we\nbelieve was linked to the usual script for divisions of labour between the producers\nand faculty members. Mikala\u2019s course was highly interactive with several different\nteams of students working together on case studies. The VU producer lacked experi-\nence with highly interactive courses, as well as training in pedagogy and curriculum\ndesign. Mikala lacked experience with online contexts and technology tools. There-\nfore, neither of them had thought ahead to provide a separate virtual space for the\nonline teams to interact. The result was that Mikala became overwhelmed trying to\nmonitor each team\u2019s interactions. This disturbance may have been avoided if Mikala\nhad taken the faculty development class where issues like this were discussed. Since\nthe VU producer was a technology expert with some design skills, but not instruc-\ntional design skills, he also did not realise the need for separate group threads.\nThe above examples taken from the cross-case analysis show how contradictions\nbetween systems in the tools, divisions of labour and rules that govern activities, as\nwell as deviations from the usual script can manifest themselves in disturbances\nwithin and between the participants. This occurred despite the fact that both the\nfaculty development course and the VU were there to help the faculty members\ndesign and teach their courses. However, the contradictions and disturbances were\nnot always bad. Sometimes they led to transformations, which are outlined below.\nResults: transformations\nTransformations in face-to-face teaching\nWhat was most interesting was that after teaching online, the three faculty members\nexperienced transformations in their thinking about face-to-face teaching. Both Jim\nand Juliet said that the experience of getting to know their online students through\ntheir writing was powerful and that this increased emphasis on writing was something\nthey would consider when they taught face-to-face. \nI was more in touch with the online students\u2019 levels of inquiry and that was a good feeling\nto see that develop and grow. I\u2019ve seen them begin to check their assumptions and see\nevidence that they\u2019re doing that because more of it is in writing. That will have repercus-\nsions now in my face-to-face classes. I\u2019ve come to believe in more frequent assignments \u2026\nIt forces students to deal seriously with the material sooner and \u2026 in an integrative and\nongoing way and then it gives us feedback sooner about what they\u2019re struggling with, what\nthey\u2019re getting and what they\u2019re not getting. (Jim, interview, 18 December 2001)\nThe faculty members also found that their online students were more accountable for\ntheir thinking about the content compared to face-to-face classes. As a result, they\nhoped to find ways to change their face-to-face teaching to get similar results. \nMy groups used Web Talk so I saw everything they did in terms of response to questions\nand how they were processing the cases. All of that was very accountable. It was all right\nthere on the Web for me to look at \u2026 I saw everything they were thinking. I don\u2019t see that\nin my face-to-face courses. I heard everybody\u2019s voice and I don\u2019t in face-to-face. (Juliet,\ninterview, 26 September 2001)\n 46\n \nL. Peruski & P. Mishra\n         Knowledge about technology\nMikala and Juliet both experienced transformations related to the use of technology\nand their comfort level using it in their face-to-face classes. These transformations\nwere important considering that neither Juliet nor Mikala initially had a desire to learn\nmuch about the technology. \nI have this zone of comfort around technology that I need to know only what I need to\nknow \u2026 but, I can actually do a lot more on the computer than I\u2019ve done before. How it\nreally has affected my teaching is that I am using more technology in my face-to-face teach-\ning. Technology has helped me a lot in terms of expanding the realm of teaching. (Mikala,\ninterview, 7 December 2001)\nAll of the faculty members gained more knowledge about technology and were\ninterested in incorporating technologies into their face-to-face teaching. Because Jim\nand Juliet took the faculty development class, they were exposed to a wide range of\ntechnologies, assessed their usefulness and used some of them in the development of\ntheir websites. With their design teams, they interacted around ideas such as the\nrelationships between content, technology and pedagogy, which played out in a\nnumber of ways during the activity of designing their online classes. They learned\nabout the affordances and constraints various technologies provided, as well as the\nimpact of the technology on representations of content. Although Mikala\u2019s course\ndesign process differed from that of Jim and Juliet, the interview data indicated that\nshe also thought extensively about the role of technology in communications and\nstudent learning.\nThe VU producer\nThe VU producer\u2019s thinking about online course design and graphic design was also\ntransformed. The experience also piqued his interest in researching such matters in\ngraduate school. \n(Juliet\u2019s) course wasn\u2019t designed by a professional graphic designer but it brings up a whole\nquestion of can graphic designers design good interfaces. Propelling my interest in\nresearch is [the question of] why the design worked well for these people. (VU producer,\ninterview, 11 September 2001)\nThis issue also spilled over into his thinking about how people learn in the online\ncontext: \nI was under the impression before that the more graphically streamlined something was,\nthe better people are gonna learn (because) they\u2019ve got less choices to make on each\nscreen. I learned from this that giving them many choices on one screen actually was easier\nfor them. Some of the questions it brought up is why did these people learn so much better\nwhen there was (multiple choices)? It prompted me to learn more about interface design;\nwhy certain interfaces work better than others in certain situations. (VU producer, inter-\nview, 11 September 2001)\nThe VU producer also thought about finding new ways to communicate with faculty\nmembers during the design activity. \n Webs of activity in online course design and teaching\n \n47\n       I think I would make it clearer in the beginning that they were working through VU for a\nreason and that if it wasn\u2019t going to work with VU, than maybe we should explore some\nother options, such as Blackboard, that would maybe suit their needs and wants better.\n(VU producer, interview, 20 December 2001)\nThe systems\nSystem level change is a more complex and time-consuming process, but there were\nindications that changes may occur in both the faculty development class and the VU\nsystem. For example, the instructor for the faculty development class noted that the\nresults from this study encouraged him to think about ways to change the class to\nmake the transition to the VU easier for faculty members.\nThe VU producer changed the VU system by creating a couple of innovations at\nthe request of Jim and Juliet. The innovations became part of the VU system and\navailable for other producers and faculty members to incorporate into other classes.\nIn addition, the producer began having discussions with VU administrators regarding\nhow they change pedagogy when it goes online. He also acknowledged that the VU\nadministrators realized that their tools had become outdated. They were also looking\nat ways to change the system to keep up with increased demand for their services, as\nwell as new types of courses such as the highly interactive ones that the three faculty\nmembers designed.\nTransformation of work activity\nThe new online program led to the creation of new work processes that took place in\ncollaborative activity across and within systems. For instance, the faculty develop-\nment class transformed the online course design activity at this university by combin-\ning faculty development and student learning for the purposes of designing an online\ncourse. The model not only changed the department\u2019s work activities, but could also\nhave led to changes in the VU system.\nConclusions\nIn this study, we used an activity theoretical framework to analyse three faculty\nmembers\u2019 experiences with designing and teaching online courses for the first time.\nSystemic contradictions emerged due to the different systems\u2019 goals, tools and divi-\nsions of labour. The systemic contradictions sometimes led to disturbances in indi-\nviduals\u2019 work processes and ultimately to transformations in both individuals, work\nprocesses and in systems.\nThe results of this study have implications for individuals and systems undertaking\ntechnology integration in teaching. For example, the new online context forced the\nfaculty members to face their anxieties about their ability to teach using technology.\nThe activity also raised questions for faculty members about their own role and iden-\ntity as teachers. The new context represented a disturbance to established practices\nthat provided the opportunity to face previously tacit thinking about issues such as\n 48\n \nL. Peruski & P. Mishra\n course design, teaching methods and philosophies on teaching and learning. Although\nthese are teaching dilemmas that good teachers often grapple with, this study revealed\nthat these issues often become automatic and scripted unless faced with a disturbance.\nThe online context provided a valuable laboratory in which to re-visit these important\nissues. Thus, although teaching online is time-consuming and sometimes creates\nanxiety, it can be an important activity because it may foreground some critical peda-\ngogical dilemmas that good teachers need to think about.\nTeaching online also provided faculty members with new insights into their face-\nto-face teaching. Increased student participation online and greater visibility of\nstudents\u2019 work encouraged faculty members to re-think their face-to-face teaching.\nThey also gained a better understanding of technology generally, as well as how to\nintegrate it into their face-to-face classes.\nThere were also implications for individuals that may work with faculty members\nto develop online classes. For example, the VU producer\u2019s thinking was transformed\nin several ways due to contradictions such as differences in design orientation, back-\nground, divisions of labour and the technological tools available from the VU. The\nproducer learned about new course design options and navigational structures; he\ncreated new technological innovations to satisfy faculty requests; he began to think\nabout new ways to interact with faculty members in order to avoid disturbances in the\nfuture; and this experience was one of the driving forces behind his decision to enrol\nin a graduate program to research questions raised while working with these faculty\nmembers.\nIn terms of the systems involved in the study, the faculty development course was\nan important support provided by the college. Faculty members learned more about\ntechnology and took more control over the online course design process than was\ntypical for most faculty members who worked with the VU system at this institution.\nIn addition, the faculty development course provided a new model for faculty devel-\nopment that other institutions could benefit from.\nOne of the values of the faculty development course was that it was not specific to\nparticular technologies. This was important because technology changes quickly.\nOpening up technological possibilities provided faculty members with more knowl-\nedge of technology, greater control over their own course designs, and it led to\ntransformations in thinking and technological innovations. However, the faculty\ndevelopment model also raised questions about whether it was a good idea to have a\ncourse that, by design, opened up technological and design possibilities for faculty\nmembers as opposed to more narrowly constraining them to fit within the model\nalready established by the VU. This faculty development model created some distur-\nbances and frustrations for the participants that might have been avoided with a\ndifferent model, or one that was more sensitive to the potential disturbances the class\ncould create between faculty members and VU producers.\nSince many institutions are currently seeking to support academics\u2019 transition to\nusing new technologies, it is likely that they could use this data to anticipate some of\nthe contradictions and disturbances that might arise for them, thereby benefiting both\nfaculty members and their students. However, not all contradictions and disturbances\n Webs of activity in online course design and teaching\n \n49\n                              can be anticipated. Additionally, this study showed that contradictions are not neces-\nsarily bad, since steps that individuals and organizations take to minimise them often\nlead to transformations in thinking, work processes and technological innovations, as\nwell as to new contradictions and disturbances.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the editors and two anonymous reviewers for their feedback\non a previous version of the manuscript.
