Methane oxidation data indicated that acetate repressed the ability of\\ud\nMethylocella silvestris to oxidize methane in peat soil microcosms. 13CH4 DNA-SIP\\ud\nexperiments revealed that in presence of acetate, Methylocella silvestris did not\\ud\nutilize methane as a carbon source, suggesting that acetate might be the alternative\\ud\nsource of carbon. However, when 13C-labelled acetate DNA-SIP experiments were\\ud\ncarried out, Methylocella spp. were not found to be dominant acetate utilizers in the\\ud\npeat soil microcosms. Methylocella spp. seem to have been outcompeted by more\\ud\nefficient acetate utilizers such as Brevundimonas and Burkholderia.\\ud\nTo identify genes that might be involved in the utilization of methane or acetate,\\ud\nMethylocella silvestris whole genome transcriptomics experiments were carried out.\\ud\nAll the genes of the sMMO gene cluster were found to be highly upregulated during\\ud\ngrowth on methane. In addition to the sMMO gene cluster, a gene encoding Fur was\\ud\nalso found to be highly upregulated during growth on methane. During growth on\\ud\nacetate, a gene cluster encoding glycine dehydrogenase was found to be highly\\ud\nupregulated. Microarray experiments carried out here provided potential candidate\\ud\ngenes for further characterization by gene knockout based studies. Further work is\\ud\nalso required to validate the microarray findings.\\ud\nA study was carried out on forest soils derived from Swedish islands that were at\\ud\ndifferent successional stages. All islands were found to be positive for the presence\\ud\nof Methylocella spp., and identity of composition of other methanotrophs were\\ud\ndetermined using a pmoA-diagnostic microarray. All the islands were dominated by\\ud\nMethylococcus, Methylosinus and methanotrophs of the uncultivated RA14 clade.\\ud\nThe diversity of methanotrophs was higher in late successional islands compared to\\ud\nmid and early successional islands. In addition the diversity of methanotrophs\\ud\ndecreased as the soil depth increased.<\/dc:description><dc:format>application\/pdf<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>http:\/\/wrap.warwick.ac.uk\/34609\/1\/WRAP_THESIS_Rahman_2010.pdf<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:subject>QR<\/dc:subject><dc:title>Molecular ecology of facultative methanotrophs<\/dc:title><rioxxterms:author>Rahman, M.
