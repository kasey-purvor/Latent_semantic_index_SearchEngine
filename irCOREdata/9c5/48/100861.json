Two\nnew high-spin isomers were populated following deep-inelastic reactions with a pulsed 92\n238U beam incident on\na thick 72\n180Hf target. Out-of-beam g-ray events were collected using the Gammasphere germanium detector\narray. In addition to the known four-quasiparticle isomers, yrast Kp5(222) and K>23 six-quasiparticle\nisomers have been observed with microsecond half-lives. These are the highest-spin isomers observed using\nthe technique of deep-inelastic excitation. The assignments are compared to predictions made by BCS and\nLipkin-Nogami multiquasiparticle calculations.\nPACS number~s!: 21.10.Tg, 23.20.Lv, 27.70.1qThe structure and excitations of the rare isotope 180Ta are\nof considerable current interest, for example Refs. @1\u20133#,\narising from its unique status as the only isotope to occur\nnaturally in an isomeric state. The 11 ground-state has a\nhalf-life of only 8 hours, whereas an excited 92 state lying at\n75 keV, has a lifetime of .1015 years. The direct decay of\nthis isomer is highly hindered due to a combination of its low\nexcitation energy and high spin, relative to the ground state.\nSeveral studies have attempted to explain the production and\nsurvival of this spin-trap isomer in stellar environments,\nmost recently Ref. @1#.\nThis odd-odd nucleus with 73 protons and 107 neutrons\nlies in a region of the nuclear chart where large prolate de-\nformations are energetically favored. This leads to partial\nconservation of the angular momentum projection K on the\nnuclear symmetry axis @4#. The decay of these intrinsic states\nto the competing collective rotational levels is hindered, pro-\nviding a sensitive probe of the underlying structure of the\nnucleus.\nPrevious experiments to study the yrast structure of 180Ta\nhave used light heavy-ion projectiles, namely, 511 B and 37Li\non targets of 176Yb @2,3#. Several new isomers have been\nobserved using these partial fusion and fusion-evaporation\nreactions, including a 31 ms Kp5152 four-quasiparticle\nstate @5#. However, this technique is limited to ;20 \\ of\nangular momentum. Recently, experiments using deep-\ninelastic reactions @6\u20138# have enabled states with spins up to\n;30 \\ to be reached @9# and K isomers have been populated\nin neutron-rich nuclei that cannot be accessed using fusion-\nevaporation reactions with stable beams and targets @10\u201312#.\nThe first isomers at spins .20 \\ , using this method of trans-\nfer and inelastic excitation are now reported.\n*Present address: Department of Physics, Oliver Lodge Labora-\ntory, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZE, UK.\n\u2020Present address: Department of Physics and Astronomy, Univer-\nsity of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, UK.0556-2813\/2000\/62~5!\/057301~4!\/$15.00 62 0573A 1.6 GeV pulsed 92\n238U beam provided by the ATLAS\naccelerator facility at Argonne National Laboratory was used\nto bombard a thick target (\u201940 mg cm22) of 72180Hf, backed\nby >50 mg cm22 of natPb. The beam energy was chosen to\nbe 15% above the Coulomb barrier, consistent with Refs.\n@11,12#. The target was enriched to 98.2% in 180Hf, the\nheaviest stable isotope, to favor the population of neutron-\nrich products. The natural pulsing period of the beam is 82.5\nns, and this was swept on two longer time ranges with ON\/\nOFF conditions of 8.25 ms\/16.5 ms and 2 ms\/4 ms ~corre-\nsponding to 100\/200 and 24 250\/48 500 beam bursts, respec-\ntively!. All of the recoils were stopped at the target position\nat the focus of the Gammasphere array, comprised of 98\ng-ray Compton-suppressed germanium detectors and 3\nCompton-suppressed planar x-ray germanium detectors. The\ntrigger condition required at least one germanium detector to\nfire in the beam-off period. These delayed events were sorted\ninto g-g , g-x-ray and g-time matrices and a g-g-g cube,\nallowing level schemes and half-lives to be deduced from\ncoincidence relations. A wide variety of targetlike isomers\nhave been observed from 69\n171Tm up to 77\n189Ir, together with a\nlarge number of nuclei from the fission of uranium. The most\nintense out-of-beam decays are those from the inelastically\nexcited isomers in the 180Hf target @12#, but the one-proton\ntransfer channels to tantalum nuclei are also strongly popu-\nlated.\nA new isomer was observed in 180Ta, feeding the known\nstates in the Kp5192 band based on the 2899 keV level\n@2,3# via transitions with energies of 492 and 370 keV. The\nlevel scheme is shown in Fig. 1. From the coincidence spec-\ntrum gated by the 365 keV transition @Fig. 2 ~top!# it can be\nseen that the new 492 keV g ray is much weaker than the\n370 keV and subsequent decays (\u201925% of the g-ray inten-\nsity!. A probable explanation for the difference in coinci-\ndence intensity is the presence of an intermediate half-life.\nThe time window for g-ray coincidences to be in the same\nevent remains open for 800 ns. A half-life of 2.060.5 ms for\u00a92000 The American Physical Society01-1\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 62 057301the 3678 keV level would allow \u201925% of the coincidences\nto fall inside of the 800 ns window. This half-life is con-\nfirmed by the absence of the 492 keV transition when the\ncoincidence window is reduced to 20 ns @Fig. 2 ~middle!#.\n~The transitions below the 22 ns isomer also have reduced\nintensity in this spectrum.! The 492 keV transition can be\ncleanly observed by gating on the 410 keV g ray and pro-\njecting the coincidence events observed between 40 and 800\nns earlier, as shown in Fig. 2 ~bottom!.\nAll of the g rays below the 4170 keV level are contami-\nnated @see, for example, Fig. 2 ~top!# precluding a half-life\nmeasurement using the g-time matrix. In addition the time\nspectra for the 16.5 ms range are distorted, perhaps as a\nresult of the high in-beam rate. Therefore, eight g-g matrices\ngated by 1.5 ms time intervals ~with 1.6 ms separating the\ncentroids!, for times .2 ms, were constructed. The peak\nareas for the transitions above the 31 ms isomer, obtained\nfrom spectra gated by the 365, 410, and 431 keV decays,\nwere plotted as a function of time, negating the problem of\ncontaminants. To correct for the distortion, the resulting\nspectrum was divided by a normalized half-life curve corre-\nsponding to a long-lived product @100 ms). ~This technique\nreliably reproduced known half-lives, for example, the 10\n61 ms isomer in 180Hf @12# was measured here to be 9.6\nms.) The result is shown in Fig. 3 yielding a lifetime of\nt1\/251765 ms. The large uncertainty arises from the pres-\nence of the \u20192 ms half-life component for the 3678 keV\nlevel and a sensitivity to the profile used to correct for the\ndistortion.\nFIG. 1.

The spins and parities for states\nbelow the (222) 3678 keV level are taken from Refs. @2,3#.05730No 779 keV decay was observed from the 3678 keV state\nto the Kp5192 bandhead, but an upper limit can be obtained\nfor the partial g-ray half-life from the maximum intensity of\nthis transition. This yields t1\/2\ng .10 ms for the unobserved\n779 keV transition. Comparisons with the Weisskopf single-\nparticle estimate show that such a half-life is only consistent\nwith l>3 transitions ~within a generous margin of 103) sug-\ngesting a spin I>22 for the 3678 keV state. From intensity\nbalancing with the 410 keV M1 transition, the total electron\nconversion coefficient for the 370 keV decay is aT(exp)\n50.0960.08. This is consistent with electric quadrupole\n@aT(E2)50.04# and electric octupole assignments\n@aT(E3)50.16# , considering only those multipolarities that\nlead to a spin greater than 21 \\ for the \u20192 ms isomer. (M2,\nM3, and higher multipoles are ruled out by this analysis.!\nTherefore, the most likely spin and parity assignments for\nthe 3678 keV state are Kp5222 and 231. Examining the\nWeisskopf units ~W.u.! for the 370 keV decay favors the E2\nassignment, as an E3 multipole would imply ;300 W.u.,\nwhich is exceptionally fast for a noncollective K-forbidden\ntransition. Thus, the preferred tentative assignment for the\n3678 keV level is Kp5(222).\nThere are two possible scenarios for the 492 keV transi-\ntion observed above the \u20192 ms isomer. Firstly, it could be\nthe direct decay from the isomeric state, consistent with l\n<3 transitions. Alternatively, the 4170 keV level could be\nthe\nFIG. 2.

The most likely spin assignment for the\n\u201917 ms isomer is 23, 24, or 25 \\ .\nIn addition to the first observation of the 3678 and 4170\n1n keV isomeric states, a new 1137 keV K-allowed transi-\ntion, with a branching ratio of 7%, has been observed from\nthe 22 ns isomer to the 31 ms isomer. This is shown in Fig.\n4. The 2587 keV I518 level has previously been assigned a\ntentative positive parity @2,3#. The absence of a competing\nquadrupole decay to the 1791 Ip5162 state favors an E3\nmultipolarity for the 1137 keV transition, supporting a posi-\ntive parity assignment for the 22 ns isomer.\nPredictions for the excitation energies, spin and parity as-\nsignments for low-lying six-quasiparticle isomers have been\nmade using Lipkin-Nogami @2# and BCS calculations @3#\n~see Fig. 5!, at deformations of \u00ab250.237, \u00ab450.056 and\n\u00ab250.242, \u00ab450.087, respectively.
