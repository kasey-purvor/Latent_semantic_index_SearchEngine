In closely examining a series of interviews, we find a number of interpretive repertoires of boundary construction used in IOR managers\u2019 identity discourse. Our analysis of these repertoires suggests that, although the development of IORs apparently signals the emergence of \u2018widening circles of identification\u2019, distinction drawing and boundary setting is as much a part of managers\u2019 IOR talk as boundary transcendence.

In closely examining a series of interviews, \nwe find a number of interpretive repertoires of boundary construction used in IOR managers\u201f \nidentity discourse. Our analysis of these repertoires suggests that, although the development of \nIORs apparently signals the emergence of \u201ewidening circles of identification\u201f, distinction drawing \nand boundary setting is as much a part of managers\u201f IOR talk as boundary transcendence. IOR \nmanagers can thus be seen as \u201eboundary bricoleurs\u201f who discursively mark different self\/other \nboundaries that varyingly position themselves, and their colleagues, competitors, customers and \nsuppliers, as \u201einside\u201f or \u201eoutside\u201f the organization, the market, the relationship or their field of \nexpertise. In this tensile positioning, they forestall closure on their identity by constantly shifting \nidentifications, sometimes within the same stretch of talk. Oscillating between an inclusive and an \nexclusive \u201eus\u201f and thus articulating embracing yet distinctive identities vis-\u00e0-vis other network \nactors enables IOR managers to navigate through their complex and dynamic inter-organizational \nfield, maintaining multiple inter-firm relationships while at the same time preserving their own \norganizational and professional status within these relationships. \n \nKeywords: boundaries, discursive positioning, identity, inter-organizational relationships, \nliminality, marketing  \n \n \nActs of organizing tend to set boundaries within which people act out or enact their \norganizational selves. Some organizational actors, however, are involved in establishing and \nmaintaining relationships across organizational boundaries, working on the notional edges of \norganizations. For those embedded in inter-organizational networks, their in-between or \n\u201eliminal\u201f (Turner 1977) position presents a particular challenge for the enactment of identity \n(Marchington and Vincent 2004). It is not yet clear how the growth of inter-organizational \nrelationships (IORs) thought to have taken place over the last few decades (Oliver and Ebers \n1998; Raab and Kenis 2009) affects IOR managers\u201f social identifications. The emergence of \norganizational networks may be seen as evidence of a historical process in which the \nlengthening and strengthening of the chains of interdependence between human beings (Elias \n1970) expand social boundaries from, for instance, family or village to nation or class, giving \n 2 \nrise to \u201ewidening circles of identification\u201f (de Swaan 1995). In a similar vein, one might view \nthe growth of IORs as instances of the breaking down of organizational boundaries and the \nbuilding of more encompassing identifications prophesised in the managerialist literature (e.g. \nAshkenas et al. 1995). Yet, although the emergence of a \u201enetwork-society\u201f (Castells 1996) \nand \u201eboundaryless organizations\u201f (Ashkenas et al. 1995) may indeed create connections \nbetween people on a larger scale, the resulting increase of boundary-spanning interactions \nmay not automatically lead to homogenisation. It may also bring forth a heterogenising \ncountertrend of people reasserting their identity by defining themselves as distinct from others \n(cf. Appadurai 1998). The research presented in this paper \u2013 an investigation of the identity \ntalk of marketing managers involved in IORs within industrial supply chains \u2013 suggests that, \ntaken on their own, each view is limited, although taken together each may complement the \nother in understanding processes of identity construction in IORs. We shall show how \nmarketing managers constantly shift identifications in their IOR talk, alternately constructing \nan inclusive or exclusive \u201eself\u201f vis-\u00e0-vis others by drawing various circles or boundaries; a \nprocess we term \u201etensile discursive positioning\u201f. \nTo study the intricacies of IOR managers\u201f identifications in an industrial network (or \n\u201emarket network\u201f \u2013 Mattsson and Johanson 2006:259) context we employ a discourse \nanalytical approach. This approach reflects the argument of Phillips and Hardy (2002: 52) that \n\u201ewe cannot understand processes of organizing unless we understand identity \u2013 and \nunderstand it from a discursive perspective because reified views of identity do not help \nresearchers capture the fluidity of social life\u201f. This perspective is important in analyzing \nsocial life in the ambiguous and dynamic context of IORs where actors are engaged in the \nconstruction of a \u201etellable\u201f marketing story which \u201enarrates boundaries, relations, agency and \nidentities\u2026\u201f (Simakova and Neyland 2008: 96) and where parties build and break \nrelationships on the basis of their conceptions of who others are and what they believe these \nothers can contribute to their goals (Beech and Huxham 2003). More generally, our \nunderstanding of who we are is intimately connected to who we think others are (Jenkins \n2004); and a focus on identity discourse helps to direct analytic attention to how \norganizational actors recursively make sense of themselves in relation to others (Ybema et al. \n2009). Through \u201ediscursive positioning\u201f (Garcia and Hardy 2007; Hopkinson 2001), placing \nourselves vis-\u00e0-vis others by drawing distinctions or by assuming resemblance and \nrelatedness in everyday discourse, we talk our identities into being, producing a particular \nnotion of \u201eus\u201f or \u201eme\u201f by comparison to \u201ethem\u201f. Identity can therefore be seen as a matter of \ndiscursively enacting relationships of similarity and difference. Claims of \u201esameness\u201f or \n\u201eotherness\u201f in relation to, for instance, colleagues, clients or competitors, position \norganizational members within a particular social context, hence establishing, legitimating \nand\/or challenging relationships of power and status (Ball and Wilson 2000; Ybema et al. \n 3 \n2009). As Ainsworth and Hardy (2004: 155) note, after de Saussure and Derrida, linguistic \nbinary oppositions are often utilised in identity construction to position the other as not \nmerely different, but also less acceptable, less respectable and\/or less powerful (Hall, 1997). \nSimilarities and differences are thus articulated, contested, and negotiated as part of a political \nprocess (Kreiner, Hollensbe and Sheep 2006; Parker 1997). \nIdentity theory thus suggests that constructing identity is bound up with discursively \nerecting self-other boundaries and constructing \u201ealterity\u201f (Czarniawska 1997). However, if \nidentity is fundamentally about distinction drawing, how then do those responsible for \nbuilding and maintaining relationships across formalised and socially entrenched boundaries \nbetween, for instance, buying and selling firms, position their organizational identities? On \none hand, constructing a boundary-crossing, client-embracing collective identity in IORs may \nbe important because, as Hardy, Lawrence and Grant (2005: 63) point out, this provides a \nrationale for addressing conflicts of interests and taking collective risks, enabling \u201eparticipants \nto construct themselves, the problem, and the solution as part of a collective framework\u201f. For \nthose managing IORs, on the other hand, drawing \u201eexternal\u201f stakeholders into a personal or \nbusinesslike relationship (and thus into managers\u201f daily thoughts and routines) implies an \nincreased exposure to stakeholders\u201f opinions and judgements. So, as managers have to build a \nsense of self as some sort of \u201ebridge\u201f across organizational boundaries, these boundary-\nspanning activities may simultaneously pose a potential threat to their organizational and\/or \nmanagerial identities. The network context, where there are few clear-cut guarantees of role \nand status, exposes managers to what Cooper and Lousada (2005) describe as \u201einter-\norganizational vulnerability\u201f that, according to Flores and Solomon (1998: 220), pertains in \nparticular to people\u201fs sense of self: \u201eWhatever other vulnerabilities may be at stake (one\u201fs job, \nsubstantial amounts of money, the success of the business) it is the self that is in some \ndanger.\u201f Writing about the potentially subordinate position of consultants (or marketing \nmanagers for that matter) to powerful or \u201estrong client organizations\u201f, Alvesson and \nRobertson (2006) note: \u201eThe unpredictable, relationship-dependent and fluctuating character \nof this kind of work can\u2026 make it difficult to accomplish and sustain a stable feeling of \ncompetence and respect.\u201f (2006: 217). So, when social boundaries are crossed and the other is \nno longer at a \u201esafe\u201f distance, it may become all the more important and, ironically, all the \nmore complicated at the same time, to hold on to a distinct and secure idea of one\u201fs self \nthrough defining \u201eotherness\u201f. Their boundary position in-between different firms requires IOR \nmanagers to navigate between multiple and sometimes contradictory demands, asking them to \nbuild relationships with various others across us\/them-divides while simultaneously \nmaintaining and \u201emarketing\u201f their professional or organizational identities.  \nDue to their ambiguous or \u201ein-between\u201f position, IOR managers can be said to work \nin a condition of institutionalised \u201eliminality\u201f (Turner 1977), which entails \u201eexisting at the \n 4 \nlimits of existing structures\u201f (Tempest and Starkey 2004). Those who \u201edwell in liminal \nspaces\u201f (Sturdy, Schwartz and Spicer 2006: 930) or who are \u201edrawn into extended circles of \nloyalty\u201f (Garsten, 1999: 603) include consultants in their relationships with clients (Sturdy et \nal. 2006; 2009), professionals with competing loyalties (both organizational and occupational) \n(Iedema et al. 2003; Zabusky and Barley 1997), temporary workers who are neither \norganizational insiders nor outsiders (Garsten, 1999), and those engaged in inter-\norganizational networks and projects (Marchington and Vincent 2004; Tempest and Starkey \n2004). These organizational actors may not encounter the temporary and voluntary liminality \nthat occurs in leisure and at the margins and interstices of social life described by Victor \nTurner, but rather a permanent and mandatory liminality, occurring at the centre of their \norganizational lives (Hannerz 1992: 286).  \nPrior studies of the liminal organizational lives of \u201eexpert\u201f managers show how an in-\nbetween position of, for instance, the staff scientists in the European Space Agency \ninvestigated by Zabusky and Barley (1997: 395) \u201erequired them to navigate a sea of complex \nrelationships\u201f. In coping with the task of leading research projects, these scientists were \n\u201econtinually confronted with competing allegiances\u201f, which involved them in what Zabusky \nand Barley term a \u201estrategic\u201f exercise of having to be \u201eprepared to make and remake \nthemselves on the spot for different audiences at different moments\u201f. The lack of any \nallegiance to a particular group was celebrated by the liminal scientists as a challenging yet \nrewarding position that allowed them to remain constantly adrift while affording them the \nopportunity to \u201esafeguard the integrity of the mission itself\u201f (Zabusky and Barley 1997: 395). \nSimilarly, Iedema et al. (2004:15) note how a \u201edoctor-manager\u201f in a teaching hospital \nmanages \u201ethe incommensurable dimension\u201f of his \u201eboundary position between profession and \norganization\u201f by positioning himself across different discourses. It appears that a form of \n(expert) stability arises from a lack of attachments which is critical for providing liminal \nindividuals with room for manoeuvre and enabling them \u201eto keep conflicting agendas in play \nacross a range of settings and in front of a spectrum of players\u201f (Iedema et al. 2003: 29).  \nWhile the discursive practices outlined in these studies pertain largely to intra-\norganizational contexts, it is on the identity talk of individuals charged with \u201emanaging\u201f inter-\nfirm relationships that this study is focused. As IOR managers also have to position \nthemselves across different discourses and divides before a heterogeneous audience, it seems \nlikely that we will find intense \u201eboundary work\u201f (Hernes and Paulsen 2003) or \u201eidentity work\u201f \n\u2013 that is, \u201ethe ongoing mental [or, in this study, discursive] activity that an individual \nundertakes in constructing an understanding of self\u201f (Alvesson, Ashcraft and Thomas, 2008: \n14) \u2013 performed at the notional limits of organizations. Exploring these discursive practices is \nimportant to the study of IORs since it illustrates how managers construct the relationships \nthat constitute the proximate environment of the network, while simultaneously securing their \n 5 \nown position within it. Language use by managers produces particular ways of understanding \nsuch trading encounters and defines appropriate patterns of social activity, thus forming the \nbasis for action (Palmer and Dunford 1996). Studying how these forms of understanding \npattern the managerial self and the network environment will develop our comprehension of \nIOR actors\u201f potential modes of engagement. \nSo, we ask, how do IOR managers discursively position themselves and their firms \nvis-\u00e0-vis competitors, colleagues, customers and suppliers? As we begin to answer this \nquestion, we follow our participants\u201f identity-constructing boundary talk by extending the \nnotion of boundaries from those that apparently enclose organizations to those surrounding \nmarkets, relationships, and professional expertise. A detailed analysis allows us to explore the \ndiscursive practices of such boundary-spanning agents as they create, maintain, and cross the \nvarious \u201emental fences\u201f (Zerubavel, 1991) organizational members use to categorize the \nenvironment.  \n \nThe study of supply chains and marketing management \nIn order to explore self\/other boundary talk for those operating in conditions of permanent \nand inescapable liminality, our contextual focus in this paper is on the organizational \nmembers involved in inter-organizational partnerships that are argued to increasingly \ncomprise contemporary supply chain management (Huemer, Becerra and Lunnan 2004; \nWagner and Boutellier 2002). The \u201esupply chain\u201f is the term by which the business system \nrepresented by an industrial network of IORs set up to support the buying and selling of \ngoods has come to be known (Svensson 2003: 306). Supply chain IORs are more than merely \nan appropriate exemplar in which to explore boundary construction, however. As we shall \nnow show, they represent a context where the discursive practices of marketing and \npurchasing managers are overdue for study, leaving underexplored how they \u201emanage\u201f or \nmake sense of the various relationships they maintain. \nScholars have long recognized the critical role played by marketing managers in \nestablishing relationships across the notional boundary that separates those in the firm from \nthose in the \u201emarket\u201f (e.g. Narver and Slater 1993; Webster 1992). As so-called \u201epartnership\u201f \nforms of organizing and collaborating emerge within industrial networks (Marchington et al. \n2005), existing perceptions of boundaries are becoming problematic for defining what is \n\u201einside\u201f and \u201eoutside\u201f the organization and for defining organizational identities. Marketing \nmanagers must also \u201emarket\u201f themselves in an \u201einternal\u201f arena where their expertise is open to \nthe scrutiny of senior company managers (Edwards 2000). Fortunately perhaps, thanks to the \nstatus of the broader marketing management discourse in their re-presentation of marketing \npractice, the \u201econceptual toolkit\u201f of the elements of strategic planning are easily available for \n 6 \nreaders of management texts. Such textbook writing employs rhetoric that often positions \nmarketing, and, by association, marketing managers, as a locus of order and control in a \n\u201ecomplex and changing world\u201f (Hackley 2003). This \u201estrategic\u201f rhetoric should therefore lend \nitself well to discursive attempts at identity construction by IOR managers.  \nWhile constructions of identity, such as discursive claims of \u201epartner\u201f status, can \nposition actors in relation to each other and thus, ultimately, shape inter-organizational \ncollaborations (Maguire, Phillips and Hardy 2001), the literature on IORs \u2013 and market-based \nIORs in particular \u2013 is sparse on the ways in which the individual actors involved in \ninteractions make sense of the relation, of themselves and of others. Some work has been \ndone on identity narratives in non-trading collaborations (e.g. Beech and Huxham 2003; \nPhillips, Lawrence and Hardy 2000), although this work is confined to a \u201enon-competitive\u201f \ncontext, largely unmediated by market mechanisms and the perceived power of the sovereign \ncustomer. Some marketing studies have taken a discursive perspective, such as Simakova and \nNeyland\u201fs (2008) examination of managerial \u201estories\u201f of new product development that \nnarratively reproduce boundaries between those marketers who \u201etell\u201f and those non-marketers \nwho \u201elisten\u201f, but few have engaged empirically with IOR-related managerial discourse. \nExceptions occur largely within advertising agency-client relationships (e.g. Svensson 2004), \nand an even smaller number addressing the supply chain context (e.g. Faria and Wensley \n2002). Most management theories of business relationships also leave the role of boundary-\nspanning individuals\u201f sensemaking practices virtually unexplored (Osborn and Hagedoorn \n1997), a view confirmed by Gronhaug, Henjesand and Koveland (1999: 179) who assert that \nmanagers\u201f \u201einterpretations of events and constructions of explanations are largely overlooked \nin research on business relationships\u201f. As Smith and Higgins (2000) point out, the move \nwithin marketing thought towards relational aspects (for instance in the \u201erelationship \nmarketing\u201f paradigm espoused by the likes of Morgan and Hunt (1994)), is an implicit \nacknowledgement of self-other identity dynamics within the supply chain and the broader \nmarket, yet the discursive practices involved in these processes are rarely identified within the \nmarketing literature. As a result, we know little of how managers discursively make sense of \ntheir identities in inter-firm exchange relationships. \nHaving set the scene for our study, in the next section we explain our methodological \napproach and our particular \u201etake\u201f on discourse analysis in order to explore the texts of \nmanagers\u201f talk and the contexts of relationships in industrial supply chains. We then present \nthe findings of our study, structuring this section around four interpretive repertoires that \nappear to be drawn upon by managers to demarcate varying levels of \u201ein-ness\u201f and \u201eout-ness\u201f \nin self and other positioning. The penultimate section of the paper offers an analysis of what \nseems to be \u201egoing on\u201f in the interview talk of managers as they struggle to make sense of \ntheir position within IORs. Finally, we conclude with some thoughts on the contribution of \n 7 \nour study to the understanding of discursively constructed identity boundaries in a liminal \ncontext. \n \nMethodology and approach to analysis \nIn taking the discursive turn, we regard boundaries as social constructions, produced through \nmeaningful interactions, and thus constituted by the collections of texts or discourses that \nexist in a particular field (Phillips, Lawrence and Hardy 2004). We set out to discover how \norganizational members draw on such boundaries to make sense of the identities of actors in \nIORs and thus form perceptions of the world(s) in which they work. This entails looking \ncarefully at the vocabulary employed in managerial accounts of inter-firm relations. More \nspecifically, we aim to identify how linguistic elements can be combined to construct social \ncategories, often in the form of complex, shifting boundaries (Heracleous 2004).  \nThe majority of the data were collected by the first author via tape-recorded field-\nbased interviews, each lasting over an hour, with thirteen managers (see Table 1) holding \nsome sort of responsibility for IORs, relationships that typically extended both \u201eup\u201f and \n\u201edownstream\u201f from the case firms. The cases represented five different UK firms embedded \nin what were described by participants as supply chains for agricultural, textile-related and \nautomotive products (see Figure 1). Five contrasting cases were chosen for analysis, \nrepresenting a variety of organizations operating within different supply chain contexts, thus \nenabling us to collect discursive data with considerable potential to account for the IOR \nthemes that might be described by participants (cf. Phillips and Hardy 2002: 68). With regard \nto individual participants, we share the view of Alvesson and Willmott (1992) that members \nof management elites are often greatly over-represented in studies. Thus, a number of \u201efront-\nline\u201f and middle managers were approached in addition to board-level participants (see Table \n1). In each case initial access was arranged with \u201egate-keeping\u201f individuals who were \npersonal contacts of the researchers. Thereafter \u201esnowballing\u201f was used to access further \nparticipants within the five firms.  \n \n \nINSERT Figure 1 ABOUT HERE \nINSERT Table 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nDuring the interviews we worked from the same common basic schedule of questions \nand probes. Participants were asked open questions concerning their role and the organization \nthat they represented; and to \u201etell us about\u201f the IORs in which their organization was \ninvolved. Interviewees were also encouraged to develop themes themselves through \n 8 \nconversational rather than directive questioning. This initial study set out to focus on claimed \nprocesses of IOR \u201emanagement\u201f, so no questions were asked which explicitly addressed \nboundary or identity issues. Nevertheless, several questions did elicit responses relevant to the \nstudy of boundary construction in relation to identity, especially during the \u201escene-setting\u201f \npart of the interview. As Alvesson and Empson (2008: 4) point out, an advantage of this was \nthat we were \u201eunable to steer the interviewee directly towards identity themes, minimizing the \npotential for \u2026imposing an awareness of identity which might otherwise be absent\u201f. \nOur analysis is founded on the notion of \u201einterpretive repertoires\u201f (Potter and \nWetherell 1987) that provide people with resources (clusters of terms, descriptions and figure \nof speech) that they can use to construct versions of reality. The repertoires we describe in \nthis paper are, to an extent, researcher-researched co-constructions. They emerged from our \nconversations with IOR managers, our own sensitisation to central concepts in the \nmanagement literature on business IORs (e.g. \u201erelationship marketing\u201f or \u201esupply chain \npartnerships\u201f) as well as our analysis of participants\u201f IOR talk (about, say, \u201ethe market\u201f or \n\u201eour customers\u201f). In determining repertoires, the first author initially analysed instances of \ntalk that seemed to stand out as particularly significant in managers\u201f sensemaking of IOR \nprocesses in order to establish a preliminary list of categories. To develop these categories, \nboth researchers then analysed, coded and categorised other stretches of talk, using NVivo \nsoftware. At this point in the analytical process, we found that managers\u201f IOR talk frequently \ninvolved invoking boundary and identity constructing language. Turning our attention to \nboundary-constructing repertoires, we began looking at what entities (such as \u201esuppliers\u201f or \n\u201ethose guys\u201f) were represented in manager\u201fs talk, as well as the way in which accounts \npositioned these entities (e.g. inclusively or exclusively). We focused the analysis on \nlinguistic use that suggested boundary construction including, in particular, the employment \nof metaphors like \u201eon our side\u201f, and deictic shifters like \u201eus\u201f and \u201ethem\u201f, or \u201ehere\u201f and \u201ethere\u201f. \nDeictic words are lexemes which \u201epoint\u201f to \u201ethings\u201f in the physical-social context of the \nspeaker (Kreidler 1998). The identification of certain nouns, pronouns, figures of speech and \nmetaphors to construct different sets of boundaries allowed us to delineate four repertoires. \nThese are highlighted in Table 2, along with sample textual fragments that they relate to (in \naddition to the data we discuss in more detail ahead). Once all the transcripts had been coded \nin this way, NVivo was used to conduct pattern searches, summarised in Table 2, which \nallowed us to move beyond a merely impressionistic view of our data.  \nNVivo also enabled us to revisit and explore who used each repertoire, when and with \nreference to what, thereby attempting to link linguistic practice to the positioning of each \nparticipant in relation to the organization, the market, the client relationship and the \noccupational discourse of marketing. At this stage we undertook a series of \u201eexpansion \nanalyses\u201f of segments of talk from each repertoire. Each segment contained talk about a \n 9 \nsingle minimal topic which took a particular perspective on an actor, action or piece of \ninformation. Expansion analyses are written interpretations of segments of talk in which the \nanalyst assumes that the meaning of the discourse is not necessarily self-evident (Wood and \nKroger 2000). For our study, this meant looking at how identities were constructed in \nboundary-related talk, as well as venturing explanations as to what these discursive strategies \nmay have been attempting to achieve. In the presentation of findings that follows, a \nrepresentative selection of our expansion analyses are used to support our analytical claims. \nThese claims are summarised near the start of the Discussion section in Table 3. \n \nFindings and analysis of boundary constructing repertoires  \nWe discerned four interpretive repertoires in our analysis of managers\u201f IOR talk: those \nrepresenting boundaries around (1) organizations; and those that can be interpreted as an \nexpansion of circles of identification and boundary setting around (2) markets, and (3) \nrelationships (or partnerships); as well as a key repertoire which rather seems to contract \ncircles of identification and discursively erect boundaries, a repertoire which we have \ncharacterised as (4) marketing management. Marketing managers use all four repertoires to \nposition themselves and others through erecting or erasing discursive boundaries. The \nrepertoires are analytically distinct, but there are instances where participants draw upon more \nthan one repertoire in a single utterance. The segments of discourse have been selected to \nprovide a variety of illustrations of the repertoire under examination, including, in many \ninstances, those segments of text that were actually constitutive of our initial interpretation of \nthe data. The selection also reflects the pattern of occurrence of use of the repertoire by all \nrelevant participants, allowing as many \u201evoices\u201f to \u201espeak\u201f as possible. The ubiquity of the \nfour repertoires in managers\u201f accounts is reinforced when we repeatedly encounter their use \nby different participants, functioning at different hierarchical levels, and representing \ndifferent organizations. See Table 2 which shows it is only Participants 3 and 4, neither of \nwhom are directly involved in marketing activities, who use three of the repertoires less \nfrequently than their colleagues. \n \nINSERT Table 2 ABOUT HERE \n \n1. The repertoire of organizational boundaries \nThe organizational boundaries repertoire is used extensively and repeatedly by all the \nmanagers in the study, with very little variation in occurrence across sector or management \nhierarchy. In drawing upon this repertoire, managers find ways of presenting the \u201eexternal\u201f in \n 10 \nways that make sense to different members of the organization. This helps to differentiate the \norganization from \u201enot-the-organization\u201f (Smircich and Stubbart 1985). Note the following \nexample: \n \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eI think the worst thing in production-led organizations is that they won\u201ft accept\u2026 the \nmessage that comes in from the outside world.\u201f \nResearcher \u2013 \u201eAnd the outside world being?\u201f \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eThe marketplace.\u201f \n(Marketing Director, Textiles\/Furniture) \n \nHere we see the setting up of an \u201einside\/outside\u201f dichotomy in terms of organizations and \ntheir \u201eseparateness\u201f from the marketplace. Moreover, \u201eproduction led\u201f firms (\u201ethey\u201f) are \nimplicitly, and negatively, contrasted with \u201emarket led\u201f firms; another level of alterity that \naffords the speaker some power as he does accept \u201ethe message\u201f. Such use of language \nsuggests that the speaker views him\/herself and other actors as positioned largely in terms of \norganizational boundaries.  \n Within this repertoire, individual managers are often constructed as \u201ebeing in\u201f or \n\u201egoing out to\u201f certain locations or organizations. In this next instance, the term \u201efield\u201f is a \nmetaphor for \u201eoutside-ness\u201f \u2013 it hints at \u201egetting your hands dirty\u201f, or \u201ereal\u201f as opposed to \n\u201ehead office\u201f work; and reinforces the deictic \u201eout\/in\u201f terminology employed by the manager: \n \n\u201eIdeally I\u201fd like to go out and work in the field, have some sort of interaction between the \n(manufacturer\u201fs name) manufacture and, er, the (dealership name) support franchises. Sort of a field \nmanager\u201fs job.\u201f  \n(Dealership Marketing Manager, Automobiles) \n \nWe find a large proportion of utterances position both the firm (or the self) and an other \n(whether organizational or individual). Yet, these boundaries are not clear-cut and \nunambiguous. For instance, sometimes the possessive pronoun \u201eour\u201f (suggesting enclosure \nwithin an organizational boundary) is used even though it concerns \u201eoutside\u201f actors. A \ndesigner (\u201eSue\u201f) may be positioned emphatically (via repetition) as \u201eexternal\u201f, but she may \nstill \u201ebelong\u201f to \u201eus\u201f, as shown in this co-constructed account where the participant responds \nto the researcher\u201fs use of the term \u201einternal\u201f. The speaker also performs a boundary conflation \nfrom the individual \u201eSue\u201f to the organizational \u201eagency\u201f in explaining the deictic \u201ethis\u201f:  \n \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eThe next job then was to sit down with Sue, with our designer, Susan Jones.\u201f \nResearcher \u2013 \u201eAnd this is an internal person?\u201f \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eNo, external. This is an external agency.\u201f \n 11 \n(Marketing Assistant, Automobiles) \n \nBoundaries also appear to be rather blurred when, for instance, managers position themselves \nclose to the customer and apart from a claimed head office \u201ementality\u201f. While acknowledging \nthe \u201egeographical\u201f\/spatial connection with fellow organizational members, they may be \ndrawing up an organizational-internal boundary in terms of a presumed difference in \nmentality and avowing their preference for the \u201ereal\u201f work done \u201eoutside\u201f. The speech \nattributed to the \u201ehead office\u201f draws upon the diectic \u201ethem\u201f and a further \u201ethey\u201f to emphasise \nalterity, allowing the manager to assert his own identity, claiming not to be in this group of \n\u201epeople\u201f:  \n \n\u201ePeople who\u201fve been internally in our company for ten years\u2026I mean in head office as opposed to \ninteracting with dealers on a regular basis. They\u201fre very [apt to think of us:] \u201eThat\u201fs them and where \nthey\u201fre based\u201f\u2026Whereas I\u201fm, although starting to fall into that geographical position, definitely not \nfalling into it mentally.\u201f  \n(District Sales Manager, Automobiles) \n \nWe thus see a considerable reliance by participants on the organizational boundaries \nrepertoire to give meaning to an \u201eexternal\u201f environment comprising individuals and \norganizations. These \u201ethings\u201f that apparently exist \u201eout there\u201f are then attended to in \nmanager\u201fs discourse as they describe some of the processes that make up interactions in \nIORs. It is not merely a matter of inclusion of \u201eus\u201f and an exclusion of \u201ethem\u201f, however, but \nalso a discursive device to draw particular outsiders \u201ein\u201f and insiders \u201eout\u201f. For instance, the \ndichotomy between being in or out seems to resonate strongly for our participants and \n\u201egetting out\u201f of head office and \u201einto\u201f customers is highly valorised. Although the circle of \nidentification drawn around \u201ethe organization\u201f is strongly present in managers\u201f discourse, it is \nthus often constructed to transcend the boundary rather than to enclose and capture everyone \nin an inside or outside position. Identities are thereby constructed via discursive boundaries \nthat are seemingly simultaneously rigid and permeable.  \n \n2. The repertoire of market boundaries  \nWe find an even stronger example of the blurring (and some examples of the re-drawing) of \norganizational boundaries, however, in the use of the market boundaries repertoire that often \ncomes to represent a wider circle of identification in managers\u201f talk. The evocation of the \nmarket as a place (physical or metaphorical) where some sort of exchange takes place is \ncommonplace. Although \u201ethe market\u201f is sometimes depicted as \u201ethe outside world\u201f, managers \nmore often cast themselves as playing an active role \u201ein\u201f the market. Like all \u201emarket goers\u201f \u2013 \n 12 \nbuyers and sellers, suppliers, dealers and customers alike \u2013 they are \u201ein the same business\u201f \nthat is encircled by the somewhat loose and fluid boundaries of the marketplace. Within the \n\u201emarketplace\u201f metaphor, customers represent others with whom trade is possible, and indeed \nnecessary, for the implied survival of the case firm, and competing traders are others who are \nall vying for the customer\u201fs business. To specify mutual trading relationships managers tend \nto cast actors as \u201esuppliers\u201f, intermediate \u201ecustomers\u201f, and \u201eend-users\u201f, thus reinforcing the \nstructure of the \u201esupply chain\u201f as a mechanism for the delivery of goods from seller to \nultimate buyer, and in which these actors are linked. This metaphoric construction is found in \nall five case firms. The imagery suggests that organizations or their representatives operating \nat different \u201elevels\u201f of the marketplace are linked together as trading partners, such as in this \naccount of an automobile district sales manager: \n \n\u201eSo I saw myself as\u2026needing to go and then be the wholesaler of their concepts, strategic direction, \nideas, processes, to my customers, the dealers. If they, if they put, if they carried them out, then the real \nend customers, for want of a better description, would buy and therefore we\u201fd be successful.\u201f \n \nHere, the dealers become \u201emy customers\u201f and part of a wider \u201ewe\u201f, a deictic shift from the \npreceding division of \u201etheir\u201f (the manufacturer) and \u201ethey\u201f (the dealers). Although our \nparticipant is keen to signify the importance of his expertise (see the marketing management \nrepertoire), which casts the dealers as customers who must \u201ebuy in\u201f to the marketing \nmanager\u201fs firm\u201fs \u201eideas\u201f, dealers are simultaneously recast as allies in selling cars to the \u201ereal\u201f \nmarket, i.e. the \u201eend customers\u201f that must \u201ebuy\u201f goods in order for the allies (\u201ewe\u201f) to be \n\u201esuccessful\u201f. \n While the market metaphor allows the drawing of boundaries in IOR talk, the \nboundaries do not keep \u201eenemies\u201f out, given that competitors can legitimately enter new \nmarkets and usurp existing IORs. In the segment below, we see the speaker painting a picture \nof the animal feeds firm he works for (\u201eus\u201f) faced with a choice of potential suppliers, one of \nwhich appears to be a new market entrant, making \u201ea lot of noise\u201f (claiming to offer lower \nprices). The metaphoric \u201emoving\u201f (or, in this case, not moving) refers to the speaker\u201fs role in \ndeciding not to switch suppliers, thus establishing his power in the marketplace and within the \nfirm: \n \n\u201eIf you get new people in the marketplace and they\u201fve [new supplier] been making a lot of noise, then \nif they [existing supplier] react [i.e. match any new price]\u2026it doesn\u201ft really justify us moving.\u201f  \n(Purchasing Manager, Animal Feeds) \n \n 13 \nIn most instances, the market boundaries repertoire is used, not only to claim a powerful \nposition for oneself, but also to locate power with a customer actor. Here, the speaker refers to \nthe power exerted by collaborating downstream competitors over the case firm, thus \nconstructing the entire network as functioning according to the discourse of the unfettered \nmarket. The deictic \u201ethey\u201f and \u201etheir\u201f set the dealers apart from the firm, and each other, yet at \nthe same time, these organizational actors are bounded as a \u201emarketing\u201f \u201egroup\u201f when they \n\u201eget together\u201f: \n \n\u201eThey\u201fve [dealers] got much wiser because they\u201fve been exposed to more and more sources of supply, \nand, and they\u201fre under greater threat as well from all their competition\u2026Yeah, those are, um marketing \norganizations, you know, groups where dealers get together, then they use their leverage.\u201f  \n(Marketing Director, Textiles\/Furniture) \n \nThe repertoire is sometimes drawn upon to positively position the speaker\u201fs own \norganization. The following account constructs something called \u201ethe marketplace\u201f, with the \npower-laden term \u201eleaders\u201f suggesting that the case firm (the deictic \u201ewe\u201f) faces some sort of \nmetaphoric \u201erace\u201f against the competition, a race that it is apparently winning. The evocation \nof \u201eeverybody\u201f reinforces the claim that the speaker (\u201eI\u201f) is not alone in her opinion within the \nfirm, thus constructing a collective organizational identity: \n \n\u201eI think everybody\u201fs conscious of the fact that we need not only to survive but need to still maintain the \nfact that we are leaders in the marketplace.\u201f  \n(Admin\/Quality Manager, Animal Feeds) \n \nThe meaning of the term \u201emarket\/marketplace\u201f varies according to the speaker\u201fs perceived \nposition in the buyer-seller relationship. For managers representing the animal feeds \nmanufacturer, for instance, the market(place) seems to comprise; at one level, farmers\u201f \nmerchants; at another, farmers themselves; and at further levels, ever more spatially distant \nfrom the case firm, supermarkets and ultimate consumers, with some sort of trading \nrelationship chaining actors in the market together. The (socially constructed) status of these \ndifferent customers affects managers\u201f identity perceptions and (claimed) actions as they \nattempt to manage IORs throughout the supply chain. Discursive positionings in terms of \u201eus\u201f \nand \u201ethem\u201f constantly shift depending on where market-based boundaries are drawn between, \nfor instance, suppliers and customers, \u201eleaders\u201f and (presumably) non-leaders, \u201einside\u201f and \n\u201eoutside\u201f. Once again, therefore, we find a boundary-drawing repertoire that facilitates the \nsimultaneous expanding and contracting of identity-forming relations. \n \n 14 \n3. The repertoire of relationship boundaries  \nFollowing on from the construction of firms as entities somehow linked by the supply chain, \nanother important discursive concept for our managers appears to be the notion of the inter-\norganizational \u201erelationship\u201f itself. The relationship boundaries repertoire tends to build a \npicture of relationships as bounded objects that \u201eexist\u201f, reifying IORs. It is drawn upon in \nmanagers\u201f talk in all five cases, discursively positioning various actors, going across \norganizational boundaries and extending the circle of identification while simultaneously \ndrawing new boundaries that exclude those \u201eoutside\u201f the relationship. This can be seen above, \nfor instance, in the \u201egroups\u201f of dealers that were evoked (i.e. \u201eThose are\u2026\u201f) in the \npenultimate segment of talk in the market boundaries section. \nIn the following account, the occurrence of the possessive pronoun \u201etheir\u201f suggests \nthat close ties are established and IORs can even be \u201eowned\u201f. The speaker is explaining that \nwhilst his head office (the deictic \u201ewe\u201f) may get involved in fleet sales negotiations, they do \nnot supply directly to corporate clients because, it seems, it is the dealers that \u201eown\u201f the \nrelationship with the customer, thereby affording the dealers rather more power than head \noffice. The bounded market metaphor is also drawn upon by this speaker via the use of \u201ein\u201f: \n \n\u201eWe\u201fre in the market to repeat sell so we involve the dealer from the start. It\u201fs their relationship and \ntheir rapport.\u201f  \n(District Sales Manager, Automobiles) \n \nIn a similar manner, the participant in the following account uses the apparently \u201ewelcoming\u201f \nmetaphor of coming \u201eon board\u201f to effectively encircle two different supplier relationships. \nNote, however, that the power in these relationships appears to reside firmly with the \nmanager\u201fs own firm in its new role as a customer not prepared to consider a sole-supply \nsituation. This is seen in the comment, \u201ewe want to keep them\u201f wherein the \u201ethem\/us\u201f \ndichotomy is revealed in the speaker\u201fs positioning of his own firm as in control: \n \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eFor a number of years there was only one supplier of rock salt\u2026 Another supplier came \non board and virtually overnight the price reduced quite considerably.\u201f \nResearcher \u2013 \u201eSo do you still deal with the original company?\u201f \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eYeah we do, because we want to keep them on board.\u201f \n(Purchasing Manager, Animal Feeds) \n \nMany relationships are portrayed with the customer in the metaphorical position of the \ncaptain who gets to decide who is \u201eon board\u201f, a powerful actor with whom \u201ea relationship\u201f \nmust be maintained and a sense of mutuality and interdependence must be established. When \n 15 \nthe roles are reversed and their position becomes that of a supplier or intermediary who is \ntrying to establish close relationships with customers, managers often engage in IOR talk that \ntells why they should be kept \u201eon board\u201f. They suggest, for instance, they are a crucial link or \nthe \u201emost valuable cog\u201f in the customers\u201f \u201elinkage\u201f with the manufacturing firm. Here, the \nDistrict Sales Manager (DSM) of an automobile manufacturer sees himself as representing \nthe manufacturer as well as the customer. Although employed by the manufacturer, the \n\u201emouthpiece\u201f metaphor suggests an identity for the manager that positions him on the \u201eside\u201f \nof the dealers: \n  \nResearcher \u2013 \u201eIs the relationship they [dealers] have with you, the District Sales Manager [DSM], or \nwith [Manufacturer Name]?\u201f \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eYes is the awkward answer! [smiles] They, er, they see the DSM as the most valuable, \nthey should and they almost always do, as the most valuable cog in, in the linkage between \n[Manufacturer Name] and, I mean, you are their mouthpiece.\u201f  \n(District Sales Manager, Automobiles) \n \nNote how the above speaker uses the \u201ecog\u201f metaphor to evoke some sort of supply chain \n\u201emachine\u201f that comprises certain parts (i.e. actors) that must fit together via relationships in \norder to \u201ework\u201f. Taking this notion further, a manager of a textile machinery supplier uses a \n\u201ebreaking down of sides\u201f metaphor to position the customer and the speaker (or his firm \u2013 the \ndeictic \u201eyou\u201f is ambiguous) as actors that need to be on the same \u201eside\u201f (or \u201ein\u201f a relationship). \nWe also see the use of the organizational boundaries repertoire as the machine \u201egoes in\u201f to \nthe client firm\u201fs factory: \n \n\u201eWith these guys [machine operator end users], if you get them on your side, you build them up, the \nmachine goes in, they hit the ground running and you have a good install.\u201f  \n \nOverall, we find a high proportion of claims of mutually-orientated relationships that both \nparties are equally positioned as \u201ebeing\u201f within. The repertoire erects a boundary around the \nIORs described, with the result that the majority of participants seem to view relationships as \n\u201ethings\u201f that have boundaries, boundaries that individuals and organizations must try and \nprotect or breach as necessary. When \u201erelationships\u201f are said to exist, it effectively constructs \nan \u201eus\u201f or an \u201eour side\u201f that transcends organizational boundaries, casts \u201eothers\u201f as (more-\npowerful or less-powerful) \u201epartners\u201f and thus embraces different actors in an overarching \nalliance or association. We thus note once more the co-existence of discursive boundaries that \ncan contain and\/or enhance the extent to which constructions of self and others can inter-\nrelate. \n 16 \n \n4. The repertoire of marketing management \nManagers seem to construct, and have to contend with, fluctuating boundaries in the context \nof IORs. In particular, they must cope with (re)constructions that position atomised actors \ncompeting within markets on the one hand, and as part of supposedly close inter-firm \nrelationships on the other. One way in which managers attempt to maintain their sense of self \nin these situations is via the use of a widespread repertoire we have characterised as \nmarketing management that erects a boundary around certain managerial skills, the \npossession of which help to define the \u201eexpert\u201f marketing manager. The repertoire is used by \nall participants to position both the individual speaker and the speaker\u201fs own organization, \nthough is somewhat less common in the discourse of the Purchasing and Administration \nManagers of the animal feeds firm (perhaps this is to do with marketing\/sales managers \nseeing themselves as more dependent on customer \u201ewhims\u201f and hence more vulnerable in \ntheir organizational roles than their upstream-facing colleagues). Here, for instance, an \nautomobiles district sales manager is quite explicit in declaring his own expertise regarding \n\u201ethe marketplace\u201f: \n \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eThey\u201fre [vans] dead easy to sell to the marketplace.\u201f \nResearcher \u2013 \u201eWho is the market for them?\u201f \nParticipant \u2013 \u201eIn my view, it\u201fs split into two. I\u201fd like to think I was slightly educated in this.\u201f \n \nThe same participant constructs his firm\u201fs \u201ecustomers\u201f (i.e. car dealers) as needing this \nexpertise. He repeatedly employs the distinction-setting deictic \u201ethey\u201f to highlight their \nshortcomings, thus reinforcing his own identity: \n \n\u201eThey just want to lean on you, or run something by you. Or they\u201fre fairly crap at something, they \nactually don\u201ft know where to start, and they want you to write four-fifths of a direct mail piece for \nthem, cos if they tried it would look terrible.\u201f \n \nMany of the accounts that use the marketing management repertoire involve statements of \ndifference in expertise that, through discursively positioning and evaluating organizational \nactors, seem to have power implications. This is achieved in the following example by \nspeaking rather patronisingly (and possessively) of \u201eour farmers\u201f and via implied binary \nopposites of primitive (versus \u201eadvanced\u201f), contemporary (versus \u201etraditional\u201f) and techno-\nphobia (versus \u201etechnology friendly\u201f):  \n \n 17 \n\u201eWe\u201fre more advanced than many companies in this sector, but our farmers are too traditional. Only the \nbigger farmers are more technology friendly.\u201f  \n(Sales Manager, Animal Feeds) \n \nA considerable amount of identity work is done using this repertoire that often positions \nspeakers as skilled or expert actors, necessary to make IORs \u201ework\u201f, by linking attributes, \nsuch as \u201ethe number one position\u201f in the next stanza, to the pronoun \u201ewe\u201f or \u201eI\u201f, a distinction \nthat can become conflated as the participant deictically shifts from \u201eI\u201f to \u201eus\u201f: \n \n\u201eI have a group of customers\u2026who tend to rely on the advice I give in that they will not take any feed \nbuying decisions before speaking to (pause) us, if you like. That\u201fs, that\u201fs the number one position, \nthat\u201fs the ultimate.\u201f  \n(Marketing Manager, Animal Feeds) \n \nUse of the marketing management repertoire often reveals speakers as acutely aware of \nmarketing planning vocabulary, and of how to use it to construct a convincing account of the \npractitioner as a marketing \u201eexpert\u201f. For example, this participant draws upon the classic \nexample of Ford\u201fs infamous quote and then the title of a best-selling marketing textbook: \n \n\u201eYou can\u201ft specify a minimum order quantity to a dealer. It\u201fs like, you know, Henry Ford: \u201cYou can \nhave any colour you like as long as it\u201fs black\u201d. What do you do if I want it in green? What do you call \nit, \u201cmarket led strategic change\u201d?\u201f  \n(Marketing Director, Textiles) \n \nManagers also appear to draw upon this repertoire in order to delineate the marketing function \nas different (and indeed superior) to other functional departments \u201einside\u201f the case firm. This \noccurs, for example, in the discourse of a manager who had just entered a new role as \u201epart of \nmarketing\u201f (in his words) two months before he was interviewed. He describes the IOR \nmanager\u201fs role as able to handle the complexity of the marketplace via the metaphor of \ncolour, contrasting the simplistic \u201eblack and white\u201f with the more diffuse \u201egrey\u201f, thus \nemphasising the negative alterity of \u201eother departments\u201f: \n \n\u201eWith accounting departments, and maybe some other departments, things tend to be more black and \nwhite, whereas the marketing brain works slightly differently in so much that, you know, there\u201fs, \nthere\u201fs much more diffusion, there\u201fs much more grey, rather than black and white situations.\u201f \n(Marketing Manager, Animal Feeds) \n \n 18 \nSomewhat similar to the preceding repertoire, managers also draw upon the rhetoric of \nrelationship marketing (RM) to evoke relationships as corporate assets that can be \u201emanaged\u201f. \nIn this way they position themselves as aware of RM\u201fs apparent importance within the \ncontemporary strategic marketing discourse. A managing director of a textile machinery \nsupplier implicitly draws on RM ideas when he claims to defend himself against competitors\u201f \nnegative assertions by having established a \u201every special relationship\u201f with customers: \n \n\u201eOur competition will always say to our potential customers: \u201cOh those guys, they\u201fre just an agent\u201d, \nand\u2026I can sit in front of a customer and say: \u201cWe\u201fve got a very special relationship though\u201d.\u201f  \n \nIn contrast to these RM-based accounts that speak of building strong ties and long-term \nrelationships with not-so-powerless customers, earlier examples of the marketing \nmanagement repertoire-in-use portrayed the selling actor (whether the speaker, the marketing \ndepartment or the case firm) as the more powerful \u201epartner\u201f in an IOR with a relatively \npassive customer. It is exactly this paradox \u2013 the rhetoric of close relationships and boundary \ntranscendence existing in combination with boundary setting through the ascription of \npositive distinctiveness to the individual and organizational self \u2013 that we will turn to in the \ndiscussion and conclusion sections of the paper. \n \nDiscussion: boundary bricolage \nWe have demonstrated in our analysis how marketing and purchasing managers draw on a \nnumber of different boundary interpretive repertoires that help to construct identities. These \nrepertoires position the speakers (and, often, the organization or the customers they claim to \nrepresent) and others as interconnected through relationships or shared interests or activities, \nand, at the same time, as somehow different from, and superior to other actors in the \nmarketplace. Managers commonly categorise other actors \u201eexternally\u201f as customers or \nsuppliers, and \u201einternally\u201f as belonging to different functional departments or \u201ehead office\u201f, \nswitching comfortably in their IOR talk from casting these actors as close and distant, as \u201ewe\u201f \nand \u201ethem\u201f, or even as \u201eour\u201f designer who is also \u201eexternal\u201f. The ways in which IOR \nmanagers draw on the four repertoires and shift between inclusion and exclusion of other \nactors works to simultaneously expand and contract circles of identification. As these \ndiscursive moves creatively fuse \u201emultiple and sometimes contradictory positions in their \nturns and their utterances\u201f, our participants\u201f self-presentation can be seen as a matter of \n\u201ebricolage\u201f (Iedema et al. 2003: 29) and IOR managers as \u201eboundary bricoleurs\u201f. The identity-\nconstructing effects of this boundary bricolage are summarised in Table 3. \n \n 19 \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nAs noted in the opening section of this paper, constructing collective identities that \ntranscend organizational boundaries and expand the circle of identification is thought to be \ntypical of contemporary \u201enetworked\u201f relationships and essential to achieving effective inter-\norganizational cooperation. We have found a lot of boundary spanning IOR talk in our study, \nbut our participants also draw on what we call an organizational boundaries repertoire to \n\u201econventionally\u201f identify themselves as representing their firm to (or in) an \u201eoutside\u201f world. \nAs managers alternately evoke their firm and themselves as the principal network actor, \u201eself\u201f \nand \u201eorganization\u201f tend to conflate in their IOR talk; for instance, where participants glide \nbetween \u201eI\u201f and \u201ewe\u201f in a single segment of talk. As representatives, they also tend to position \ntheir firm favourably in relation to competing firms, characterising their firm as, say, a \n\u201emarket leader\u201f. Yet, in their talk IOR managers draw on the same repertoire also to stress the \nsupposedly strong ties that have been built \u201eexternally\u201f, across organizational boundaries; i.e. \n\u201edownstream\u201f with clients and customers and \u201eupstream\u201f with suppliers. Using deictic shifters \nsuch as being \u201ein\u201f or \u201eout\u201f of the organization, they position themselves and their work as \ncrossing the notional organizational boundary and working \u201eoutside\u201f the organization \u201ein\u201f the \nmarketplace. This results in an organizational boundary that could be characterised as being \nsimultaneously \u201ethick\u201f and \u201ethin\u201f. \nTo further strengthen the notion of transcending organizational boundaries, managers \nalso invoke some alternative ways of talking about IORs. Utilising the market boundaries \nrepertoire allows managers to draw a more inclusive circle of identification, albeit somewhat \nloose and porous and, perhaps, \u201ethinner\u201f than those surrounding organizations. Although the \nmarket sometimes constitutes the organization\u201fs outside world, IOR managers tend to see \nthemselves and their firms as all working \u201ein\u201f the same market or business, chained together \nthrough supplier-customer relationships. In themselves, these relationships constitute a rich \nreservoir for making sense of IORs as well. Drawing on a relationship boundaries repertoire \n(and something called \u201erelationship marketing\u201f in the marketing management repertoire), \nmanagers claim that establishing and maintaining \u201epartnerships\u201f are critically important for \nsurviving in the market. These alternative repertoires thus allow managers to discursively \ntraverse organizational boundaries and effectively widen the circle of identification.  \nHaving said this, findings also indicate that the \u201eblurring\u201f of boundaries seems to \nsimultaneously prompt an inclination to re-accentuate distinctiveness vis-\u00e0-vis other \nstakeholders and to resurrect \u201edisappearing\u201f boundaries, effectively constricting the circle of \nidentification. Managers draw on the same four repertoires to throw up distinctions and \ndivides between, for instance, competing suppliers within the same market, the more and the \nless powerful (as with groups of customers who get together and \u201euse their leverage\u201f), or \n 20 \nbetween being \u201ethe most valuable cog\u201f (us) and \u201ejust an agent\u201f (them). Such divisive \ndiscursive moves can also be seen when a relationship is established in IOR talk that goes \nacross organizational boundaries, thereby extending the circle of identification. Often, IOR \nmanagers use this \u201eoutsideness\u201f to claim to be on the customer\u201fs \u201eside\u201f, to re-emphasise the \nimportance of their individual selves vis-\u00e0-vis the organization, and to distance themselves \nfrom those who are not working \u201ein the field\u201f, who are far away from the \u201ereal action\u201f and \nwho suffer from a head office \u201ementality\u201f. In this vein, drawing on the relationship \nboundaries repertoire and claiming to maintain close relations with customers can in itself be \nused to determine who is \u201ein\u201f and \u201eout\u201f of the IOR, effectively excluding competitors or \ncolleagues from that relationship. So within each repertoire too, circles\/boundaries are drawn \nand extended. Distinction drawing and self-enhancement are thus as much part of IOR \ndiscourse as is the building of boundary-crossing relationships and linked supply chains.  \nParticipants\u201f positioning is typically self-promoting, seemingly in order to secure \ntheir status in relation to buyers, competitors and colleagues (and, arguably, us as \nresearchers). Self-promotion in relations with internal or external actors is most often \nattempted through the use of the marketing management repertoire. Managers may feel \nclosely related to customers, but, at the same time, they may mark and market their individual \nand organizational selves within this relationship as \u201eprofessional experts\u201f. We acknowledge \nthe possibility that, in drawing upon the marketing management repertoire, speakers could be \nenacting a managerial role for our benefit as researchers. In this way, the subject position \ncontained within management textbooks is reconciled with that occupied by managers. In \neffect, we may be witnessing intertextuality \u201ein action\u201f as participants are subject to the \n\u201ejudgemental gaze\u201f of marketing strategy textbooks for internalisation (Harding 2003). Yet, \nthe adoption of IOR talk replete with marketing jargon also helps to maintain the managerial \nstatus and power position of participants in the wake of the judgmental gaze of both internal \n(e.g. colleagues) and external (e.g. customers) stakeholders. The marketing management \nrepertoire appears to erect a rather \u201ethick\u201f boundary. Apparently, it is not only important for \n\u201eeffective interorganizational collaboration\u201f that participants in a relationship \u201ediscursively \nproduce a collective identity for themselves\u201f (Hardy et al. 2005: 63). Equally important in the \neyes of IOR managers is to maintain a reputation as a marketing expert within that \nrelationship in order to build rapport and strengthen the chain of interdependence. \nMetaphorically speaking, it might increase the chance to be asked \u201eon board\u201f by the supply \nchain \u201ecaptain\u201f and reduce the risk of getting thrown overboard. \nOur close scrutiny of managers\u201f discourse has thus revealed an intersecting range of \nboundary-related interpretive repertoires. As an anonymous reviewer (cited by Kreiner et al. \n2006:1336) puts it, these repertoires are deployed by participants to \u201emaintain, defend [and] \nexploit\u2026particular subject positions in [the] relations of power\u201f that underpin supply chain \n 21 \nIORs. The use of certain deictic shifters, nouns, metaphors and grammatical constructions of \ncommonality and alterity create a fluid worldview. Constructions of identity appear to shift, \ndepending on the speaker\u201fs perspective and the specific operating context being described. \nThis suggests little sense of \u201eclosure\u201f (either for an individual manager, or between managers) \naround what it means to be part of an organization, a relationship, or a marketplace. Their \nIOR talk indicates that managers try to \u201emanage\u201f and make sense of their liminal positions \nthrough a process of \u201etensile discursive positioning\u201f, continually shifting their identifications.  \n \nConclusions \nWe have taken a special interest in self\/other identity talk and boundary setting practices of \norganizational actors who work \u201ein-between\u201f organizations, constantly crossing the notional \nboundaries of their firm. The question we have asked is how marketing managers \nprofessionally involved in building and maintaining inter-organizational relationships in an \nindustrial supply chain context discursively position themselves and their firms vis-\u00e0-vis \ncompetitors, colleagues, customers and suppliers. The literature on inter-organizational \nrelations offers \u201evirtually no discussion of the processes that characterize interpersonal \nrelations within and between organizations\u201f (Marchington and Vincent 2004: 1030). Our \nanalysis of the boundary-related talk of IOR participants is of significance to those who study \ninter-organizational relationships as well as to scholars of identity.  \nAs explained earlier, studies of organizational identities suggest organizational actors \ntend to articulate their identities through drawing boundaries between themselves and others \n(Ybema et al. 2009). Our account of discursive boundary crossing and distinction drawing in \nthe talk of IOR managers shows this self-sensemaking practice in detail, revealing that \nidentity formation in liminal situations is an inherently dynamic and ambiguous process. On \nthe one hand, the study suggests that IOR managers draw wide circles of identification that \nenclose clients and suppliers in a broad and embracing \u201eus\u201f. By stretching the boundaries of \nthe organization or invoking categories such as \u201erelationship\u201f, \u201emarket\u201f or \u201esupply chain\u201f, \nmanagers provide a rationale for addressing conflicts of interests and continuing close \ncollaboration by constructing boundary-transcending collective identities, a strategy purported \nto be important for making IORs \u201ework\u201f (Hardy et al. 2005). Since managers also invoke a \nmore narrow and exclusive \u201eme\u201f or \u201eus\u201f in their IOR talk, our analysis shows, on the other \nhand, that managers refrain from entering a boundary-less world in which basic distinctions \nbetween insider and outsider become fully blurred. So, although the development of IORs \nsignals the emergence of widening circles of identification, distinction drawing and boundary \nsetting are as much a part of supply chain managers\u201f IOR talk as boundary transcendence. \nRefining and extending our insights into organizational actors\u201f identity talk, our research \n 22 \nsuggests liminal individuals do not understand themselves in terms of clear and unambiguous \nboundaries between \u201eus\u201f and \u201ethem\u201f, but instead are inclined to \u201eresolve\u201f the ambiguities of \ntheir in-between position by alternately widening and contracting the circle of identification, \nconstantly switching between different boundary repertoires. \nOur expansion analyses of participants\u201f use of various interpretive repertoires have \nmagnified the details of these discursive (re)constructions of self\/other boundaries in IOR \ncontexts. Managers draw on four boundary-constructing repertoires (i.e. those enclosing \norganizations, markets, relationships and marketing management) to alternately position \nthemselves, and their colleagues, competitors, customers and suppliers, as \u201einside\u201f or \n\u201eoutside\u201f the organization, the market, the relationship or their field of expertise. \nOrganizational boundaries are crossed in IOR managers\u201f identity talk that treats clients as an \nintrinsic part of one\u201fs own organization, enclosing \u201eour\u201f customers and suppliers in \u201estrong\u201f \nand \u201ecommitted\u201f relationships or chaining them together \u201ein\u201f one market-place. Yet, the \ndiscursive expansion of \u201ethe organization\u201f across its own boundaries in trading partnerships \nrepresents a process that, for all its inclusiveness, also entails a differentiating and excluding \nmomentum, privileging more narrow identifications of a bounded organization, presumed \nleadership in the market, and unique professional expertise. Identity boundaries are erected in \nIOR discourse when managers claim to possess unique resources and status as representatives \nof their firms as well as managerial and marketing expertise vis-\u00e0-vis client organizations, \ncolleagues in head office or competing firms. Boundary work in IORs is thus at once \ninclusive and exclusive, actively seeking network-expansion and claiming to be a crucial and \ndistinctive knot in the network, emphatically embracing \u201eclose customers\u201f while nonetheless \nrating oneself and one\u201fs firm more highly than other network members. Liminal identity talk \nin this context positions the speaker as oscillating between \u201ein\u201f and \u201eout\u201f, \u201esame\u201f and \u201eother\u201f, \nand between an inclusive and exclusive \u201eus\u201f. \nWe have introduced the term \u201etensile positioning\u201f to explain the processes of \ndiscursive construction at work here. IOR managers constantly shift identifications and hence \nbuild relationships with customers and suppliers across organizational divides while \nsimultaneously preserving their own status within these relationships by staking out the self \nagainst various others. Tensile positioning takes place in relation to discursive boundaries that \nare constructed as simultaneously permeable or \u201ecrossable\u201f (e.g. organizational and functional \nboundaries) and flexible or \u201estretchable\u201f (e.g. market or relationship) boundaries. The \nresultant positioning is \u201etensile\u201f in two senses: on the one hand, IOR managers are shifting, \nmoulding and \u201emarketing\u201f their identities and thus crossing and stretching boundaries on their \nown terms. Our participants attempt to manage the complicated and contradictory demands \nplaced on them by continually shifting and securing their \u201eselves\u201f and alternately crossing and \nsetting discursive boundaries with marketplace others. The discursive construction of \n 23 \nbounded relationships as links in the supply chain, and the articulation of marketing \nmanagement expertise, appears to offer some sense of control and relative power in managing \nthe situation. On the other hand, managers are also being stretched in that they are \u201e\u201cvictims\u201d \nas well as perpetrators of discourse\u201f (Alvesson and Willmott 1992: 7) as they find themselves \ncaught up in, and moulded by, the institutional processes surrounding IORs, such as when \n\u201ethe market\u201f gives customers power and encourages competition between suppliers. While the \nterm \u201evictim\u201f is perhaps too strong considering the adept manner in which our participants \nseem to wield the various repertoires at their disposal, the influences of market pressures, \nprofessional expectations, managerial impositions, and organizational requirements seem to \nconstrain and coerce or \u201epersuade\u201f IOR managers to stretch and constrict their identifications \nin order to meet various situational interests and institutional demands. \nIn their professional capacity, the everyday work of IOR managers requires them to \nnavigate through their complex and dynamic inter-organizational field; an effort that \nconstantly confronts them with conflicting obligations \u2013 including those to institution, market, \nclient, and profession (cf. Zabusky and Barley 1997: 395). Thus, IOR managers are \nperpetually in a liminal position, continually crossing the threshold (limen) of myriads of \norganizations while identifying with none in particular and\/or many at the same time. Like \nquicksilver, they have to be prepared to cast and recast themselves in an instant for different \naudiences at different times, all the while attempting to maintain multiple inter-firm \nrelationships. IOR managers can thus be seen as boundary bricoleurs who, as Iedema et al. \n(2003: 29) put it, successfully \u201edefer closure\u201f on their identity and on the discourses that \nrealize it by positioning themselves across different boundary repertoires, effectively \n\u201eweaving incommensurable positions together\u201f (Iedema et al. 2003: 15). IOR managers\u201f \npresentation of their selves is thereby arguably a skilful accomplishment, a \u201efeat\u201f of bricolage \nwhich allows them to interact more easily with people from various organizations (Fairclough \n2005). Yet, we concur with Iedema et al. (2003) in suggesting that liminal individuals do not \nso much follow a pre-planned, purposive strategy, but instead display a consummate \nsensitivity to the situational dynamics of, in our research, inter-organizational relationships, \ngearing up to the politics of setting and transcending boundaries within those relationships.  \nWhile Zabusky and Barley (1997) have argued that liminal actors fashion their \nidentity with an excluding rhetoric of how they are always different from all others and do not \nbelong to any group, thus presenting themselves as if each individually inhabits a relatively \nstable social space of \u201eno man\u201fs land\u201f, we have shown instead how IOR managers also use \ntheir \u201ebetweenness\u201f or \u201eplacelessness\u201f (Zabusky and Barley 1997: 370) as their operating base \nfrom where they build allegiances, dynamically switching between a rhetoric of exclusion and \na rhetoric of inclusion and, ultimately, managing simultaneously to \u201ebelong\u201f and to be \ndifferent. IOR managers need to remain attuned to the nuances of being both an insider and an \n 24 \noutsider at the same time, balancing the tension between having to carry the \u201eburden of \notherness\u201f while profiting from the \u201estrength of weak ties\u201f (cf. Sturdy et al. 2009: 11). We \ntherefore concur with Zabusky and Barley (1997) in their argument against human resource \nstrategies that aim to bolster liminal actors\u201f loyalty to their \u201eparent\u201f organization. Equally, any \nmoves to inculcate a strong sense of so-called client- or \u201emarket-orientation\u201f (Narver and \nSlater 1990) in boundary-spanning personnel may also be counter-productive. Whether IOR \nmanagers\u201f tensile positioning is strategic or merely highly sensitive, it is likely that the room for \nmanoeuvre it creates for these liminal actors would be compromised by overly rigorous \nattempts either to integrate them into the organization or to bind them to customer relationships.  \nOur study has shown the value of taking a discursive approach to researching identity \nconstructions and boundary-setting practices in industrial networks. It confirms the growing \nrecognition that there is much to be gained by turning our analytical attention to the \nsensemaking practices performed by actors in boundary positions. The accounts provided by \nIOR managers in our study illustrate how these actors draw upon a series of interpretive \nrepertoires to articulate their identities; identities that are founded on (re)constructions of \ncommonality and alterity which fluctuate with the tensile positioning of selves and others \nafforded by discursive boundaries. By detailing the alternate crossing and setting of \nboundaries in marketing managers\u201f IOR talk, we have seen some of the discursive moves of \norganizational actors working in liminal contexts in action, enabling us to theorise how \nboundary setting and crossing plays a role in structuring the world(s) of IORs and establishes \nsome of the network \u201erealities\u201f into which managers act. Shedding new light on how IORs are \nexperienced and produced by the actors involved provides a more detailed understanding of \nhow managers in positions of liminality repeatedly draw different circles of identification, \nmarking (or indeed \u201emarketing\u201f) themselves and others through tensile positionings.  \n \nNote  \nWe are grateful for the careful guidance and numerous suggestions offered by the journal\u201fs Senior \nEditor and all three reviewers. \n \nReferences \nAinsworth, Susan and Cynthia Hardy 2004 Discourse and identities, in Grant et al (eds.) \nHandbook of Organizational Discourse, London: Sage. \nAlvesson, Mats and Laura Empson 2008 \u201eThe construction of organizational identity: \nComparative case studies of consulting firms\u201f.

Organizations Indicated by words such as we, us, the company, in here\/out there, them, they, Company Names: \n \nWe\u2019ve got eight different suppliers out there \u2013 P3 \nEverybody [case firm employees] has got to be customer focused**, whether it\u2019s internal or external \u2013 P5 \nThey [competitors] go into Ford and Ford says, \u2018Ah yes, we know who you are\u2019 \u2013 P9 \nWe worked together* with outside consultants \u2013 P10 \nn = 342 segments of talk \n \nUsed by all participants fairly equally \n \n* also indicates Repertoire 3 \n** also indicates Repertoire 4 \n2. Markets Indicated by such words as the market(place), customers, end users, middle men, suppliers, in\/out: \n \nOur* customer is the farmer, the end user, and our route to market is the middleman \u2013 P1 \nWe\u2019re supplying their* [manufacturer\u2019s] products to the market \u2013 P8 \nThis product was brought to us [by an importer] because of our position** in the marketplace \u2013 P10 \nA lot of our output is for the dealer [customer] network \u2013 P11 \nn = 165 segments of talk \n \nUsed by all participants, though less \noften by P3 & P4 \n \n* also indicates Repertoire 1 \n** also indicates Repertoire 4 \n3. Relationships Indicated by such words as relationship, partnership, agreement, it, in\/out: \n \nRelationships at every level [in the supply chain] are vital in this business \u2013 P1 \nIt was a distant relationship [with a customer], but now it\u2019s much closer \u2013 P2 \nOur philosophy is to work in partnership with our suppliers \u2013 P8 \nThe discount means a fantastic buy-in, so they* [customer] won\u2019t look outside of the agreement \u2013 P13 \nn = 231 segments of talk \n \nUsed by all participants, though less \noften by P4 \n \n* also indicates Repertoire 1 \n4.

Identity-constructing effects of boundary repertoires \n \nRepertoire of \nboundaries \naround: \nExpanding  \ncircles of identification \n \nContracting  \ncircles of identification \n \nEffects of shifting boundaries  \nand identifications \n1. Organizations \n \n \na. Sometimes constructs nominally \u201eexternal\u201f \nothers as \u201epart of\u201f the case firm  \nb. Contrasts \u201ehead office\u201f vs. \u201ethe field\u201f, with \n\u201egetting out\u201f through a permeable boundary into \nthe latter being valorised  \na. Constructs the case firm as a bounded \nentity, with \u201ewe\u201f and \u201eus\u201f as individuals \nbelonging \u201ein here\u201f \nb. Constructs other organizations as bounded, \nseparate entities, with \u201ethem\u201f and \u201ethey\u201f \npositioned \u201eout there\u201f \nOrganizations are constructed as bounded and as \nenclosing individuals, but  \nsimultaneously  \nreconstructed with permeable boundaries that \nmanagers can cross in order to work \u201eoutside\u201f their \nfirm and \u201einside\u201f other organizations  \n2. Markets \n \n \na. Naturalises trading with any \ncustomer\/supplier \u201ein the market\u201f  \nb. Constructs competing \u201eothers\u201f who are free \nto enter the marketplace  \nc. Constructs trading links with other supply \nchain actors in order to serve \u201ecustomers\u201f \na. Usually constructs the sovereign, distinct \n\u201eend user\u201f customer as exerting power \nb. The case firm is sometimes claimed to have \na position as distinct \u201emarket leader\u201f \n \nMarkets are constructed as bounded and containing \n\u201etargetable\u201f customers, but  \nsimultaneously  \nreconstructed with flexible boundaries that \nmanagers can stretch in order to ensure that they \nand their firms work \u201ein\u201f the marketplace \n3. Relationships \n \n \na. Reifies supply chain links as \u201erelationships\u201f, \nwhich actors are positioned as being \u201ein\u201f  \nb. Usually constructs organizations as \n\u201epartners\u201f, on the same \u201eside\u201f, with equal power \na. Constructs some relationships as \u201eowned\u201f \nby the powerful case firm (typically in its role \nas supplier), thereby excluding competitors \n IORs are constructed as bounded, but  \nsimultaneously  \nreconstructed with flexible boundaries that \nmanagers can stretch (or defend as necessary) in \norder to ensure that they and their firms take part \n\u201ein\u201f close relationships \n4. Marketing \nmanagement \nexpertise \n \n \na. The \u201erelationship marketing\u201f variant of this \nrepertoire sometimes casts the case firm and \nothers as mutual \u201epartners\u201f in IORs  \na. Constructs IORs as a \u201emarketing \nmanagement\u201f issue requiring the use of \nspecialist marketing knowledge  \nb. Usually \u201eexternally\u201f valorises an expert \nspeaker and case firm over passive customer \nand supplier \u201eothers\u201f  \nc. \u201eInternally\u201f valorises the \u201eexpert\u201f role of the \nspeaker and the marketing department \nThe expertise of managers is constructed as \nbounded, but  \nsimultaneously  \nreconstructed with permeable boundaries that \nmanagers must prevent others crossing in order to \nmaintain their superior expertise \u201ein\u201f marketing, \nboth externally and internally \n \n \n 31 \n \n"}
