If the views of these interested parties are not\nexplored and taken into consideration before and during the\ndevelopment of an interorganizational system, it is likely that the\nimplementation of this system will be disappointing. This paper\ndescribes one approach to exploring these views through the use of\nstakeholder analysis. More specifically, it describes how to identify the\nstakeholders, a process that has been overlooked in the stakeholder\nanalysis and interorganizational systems literature, and examines the\nperceptions of a number of stakeholders in the drug use management\nfield in the United Kingdom.\nIntroduction\nIt is well documented in the information systems literature that the development of an\ninformation system normally requires the participation of a number of interested parties\nand the extent and effectiveness of their participation is likely to influence the success of\nthe resulting system (e.g. Mumford & Weir, 1979; Checkland & Scholes, 1990; Cavaye\n& Cragg, 1995). Typically these participants include the developers and users of the\nproposed new information system. However, there is a broader range of people, groups\nor organizations who are interested in the development of the information system, are\nlikely to be affected by its use or are in a position to influence its development. This\nbroader range of \u2018stakeholders\u2019 is particularly evident in the case of interorganizational\n2systems as these exist across organizations and therefore are influenced by more loosely\ndefined actors. Identifying these stakeholders and exploring their perspectives is a\ncomplicated task but essential in our view for understanding the complexity of the\ninterorganizational context. \nThe aim of this paper is to enhance our understanding of this disparate context which\naffects the development and implementation of interorganizational systems by\nconsidering a range of participants or stakeholders broader than those previously\nconsidered in the information systems literature (e.g. Galliers & Sutherland, 1991; Lee\n& Gough, 1993; Ruohonen, 1991). In particular, our understanding of stakeholders in\nbased on Freeman\u2019s definition, according to which \u201ca stakeholder in an organization is\nany group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the\norganization\u2019s objectives\u201d (Freeman, 1984, p. 46). Since we are looking at\ninterorganizational information systems, we consider in particular individuals, groups and\norganizations who can affect or be affected by the interorganizational system under study.\nAs an example, we use the area of drug use management, where information systems are\nbeing increasingly used both to manage information on patients, on drugs and on the\ncosts of drugs and to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of drug use policies. Such\ninformation systems may be developed to serve the purpose of particular organizations:\ninsurance organizations wishing to minimise costs, hospitals managing tight budgets or\ngovernment health agencies seeking the most effective health care provision. As a result,\nthe computer based information systems used in the domain vary significantly in terms\nof size, scope, complexity, types of organizations involved and area of application.\nExamples of systems include pharmacy management systems within hospitals,\nsophisticated on-line prescription systems for family doctors (GPs), EDI links between\ndrug manufacturing companies and pharmacies and the PACT (prescription analysis and\ncost) system which gathers, compares and reports on prescribers\u2019 habits. \n3In the following section we review the different ways that information systems\nresearchers have considered the participants in systems development. It shows that as the\nfocus moves from small scale, internal systems to strategic and interorganizational\nsystems, the range and importance of interested parties increases, but suggests that all too\noften the role of many of these parties is ignored. We then discuss the inadequacies of\nother stakeholder analysis approaches in identifying stakeholders. Using insights from\nother theoretical perspectives, such as the network approach (e.g. Axelsson & Easton,\n1992; H\u00e5kansson, 1987; H\u00e5kansson, 1989), which have influenced the study of\ninterorganizational systems we suggest a more rigorous approach to stakeholder\nidentification. This approach is then used to identify the stakeholders who can influence\nthe development of drug use management systems. In so doing, we also highlight the\ncomplexity of the existing situation. Finally, we discuss the benefits and shortcomings\nof the proposed stakeholder identification process and suggest further steps for\nstakeholder analysis in the context of  interorganizational systems. \nA review of participants and stakeholders in information systems development\nThe notion that successful information systems can only be developed in conjunction\nwith a range of \u2018interested parties\u2019 is nothing new and the benefits of doing so normally\nbecome apparent when the systems move away from being experiments with technology\nand attempt to become integrated in an organizational setting (Whitley, 1991). We wish,\nhowever, to draw attention to the difference between the participants in the information\nsystems development process and stakeholders. Participants are taken to be individuals,\ngroups or organizations who take part in a system development process. We define\nstakeholders as these participants together with any other individuals, groups or\norganizations whose actions can influence or be influenced by the development and use\nof the system whether directly or indirectly. In order to demonstrate this difference, we\npresent in this section a brief review of the main forms of information systems\n4development that currently exist, highlighting the participants (and the stakeholders) in\neach form of system development.\nThe development of small systems\nSmall systems are taken to be systems that help support some part of the work of the\norganization, without being fundamental for the whole organization. For example, a\nsystem that tracks the details of postgraduate applications for a university department\nmay be considered to be a small system as it is only used by the department and has no\nformal links to other parts of the organization.\nThese types of systems are typically developed by a small project team which may consist\nof a system programmer, a manager (problem owner) and representatives from the target\nuser group. Such a project will typically have been agreed by the managerial level of the\nuser group and will be undertaken within a limited budget and timescale. The participants\nin the development process are explicitly known and there are unlikely to be other\nstakeholders who have any real influence (although they may have been more visible in\ngetting the project approved originally).\nOrganization wide systems\nOrganization wide systems are qualitatively different because the services they provide\nunderpin the entire operations of the organization. Therefore, while the small scale\nsystem may be readily accepted by a user group because it is tackling a particular problem\nthey face, organization wide systems are more likely to face resistance to change. One\nreason can be that some parts of the system may challenge existing power structures\n(Keen, 1981).\n5The issue of resistance to change has been explicitly addressed in the information systems\nliterature, particularly within the socio-technical approach (e.g. Mumford & Weir, 1979;\nLand, 1982; Land & Hirschheim, 1983), which advocates that the basis of support for a\nsystem can be broadened by soliciting and incorporating a wider range of opinions. Thus,\nfor example, the ETHICS method (Mumford & Weir, 1979; Mumford, 1995) seeks to\nempower the users of the new system so that they can design the kind of work\nenvironment they will feel happy using (or cannot so easily reject, since they designed\nit).\nSimilarly, in soft systems methodology (Checkland, 1981; Checkland & Scholes, 1990;\nStowell, 1995) the perceptions of a wider range of interested parties, not just users, are\nrecorded and form the basis for the description of a new system. The resulting \u2018rich\npicture\u2019 that describes the problem situation is then used as the basis for the system\nrequirements. Whilst soft systems methodology does not label these people as\nstakeholders, within our definition they are.\nBoth ETHICS and soft systems methodology attempt to widen the purely technical side\nof the systems development to include further internal stakeholders -in  the case of soft\nsystems methodology also to external parties with an interest in the system. Whilst these\napproaches broaden the notion of information systems stakeholders beyond those active\ninvolved in the system\u2019s development, they tend to concentrate on those stakeholders\nwhose opposition to the system can result in the system being abandoned. \n6Strategic information systems\nImplicit in the previous section was the view that developing an organization wide system\nis beneficial. Reaching this decision is not always easily done and, in many cases, may\nresult in the organization needing to fundamentally re-evaluate its key business processes\n(Hammer, 1990). In such cases, the development of large scale integrated systems\nbecomes a strategic decision. The conventional wisdom over recent years has been that\nwhilst information technology can be a strategic asset, deciding on where the strategic\nadvantage lies and in which way the strategy should be developed is one which cannot\nbe left purely to the information technology function (Earl, 1989; Porter & Millar, 1985;\nGalliers & Sutherland, 1991; Galliers, 1993). Typically, strategy development requires\na combination of good technical skills, an understanding of possible technological\ndevelopments and a firm grasp of the nature of the business. Thus the decision making\nprocess involves a wider range of stakeholders than the previous stages. At this level\nquestions cannot be answered on the basis of current work processes and technology\nalone. Thus, whilst an organization-wide information system that brings operational\nbenefits to the business (e.g. computerization to enhance productivity and automation of\nprocesses) affects mainly those involved in the work process, strategic use of information\ntechnology should also include a thorough understanding of opportunities and threats in\nthe broader business environment (Galliers, 1993). \nInterorganizational systems\nAt present, most strategy development focuses on changing the information handling\npractices of an individual organization, but there are increasing trends towards examining\ninterorganizational links which are both enabled and prompted by the development of\ntelecommunications technologies. The primary example of this at present is the\n7increasing use of electronic data interchange, to the extent that it has now become, at least\nin some sectors, a strategic necessity rather than a source of competitive advantage\n(Benjamin et al, 1990; Meier, 1995; Reekers & Smithson, 1996). \nIn these situations, the question of who participates in the information systems analysis\nand development process becomes more difficult to address as the decision is no longer\nan internal one. Problems of resistance to change and motivation to participate in\ninformation systems development become qualitatively different when applied between\norganizations (Cavaye, 1995a). Staff may be persuaded that using a new system is best\nfor the operation of their organization, but may not be so easily convinced if the benefits\nare accrued by other organizations.\nParticipants or Stakeholders?\nThe information systems (in the broad sense of the word) described in the previous\nsections were either contained within the organization or between consenting\norganizations. Increasingly, however, there are interorganizational systems which are too\ncomplex to fit into any of these existing system development models. \nFor example, the drug use management process in the United Kingdom, and the\ninformation systems to support it, are larger than any individual organization or\norganizations. The process is made up of many different actors, some who have\nconsenting relationships (for example, between drug suppliers and hospital pharmacies),\nsome who have statutory relationships (for example, between the prescription pricing\nauthority and the drug dispensers) and some who have no direct relationship at all.\nHowever, each of these stakeholders is to some degree inextricably intertwined with the\nothers and cannot act independently. This is due to the peculiar nature of the drug use\nmanagement domain, whereby those who order the drugs (prescribers: hospital doctors,\n8GPs, nurses) are different from those who consume the drugs (patients) and different\nfrom those who are charged for their use (third party payers, such as insurance\ncompanies).\nAs a result, the number of stakeholders involved in system development and use is far\ngreater than that of most traditional organizational systems. Moreover, because the\ninterrelations of these stakeholders are complex and often indirect, they are all to a\ngreater or lesser extent in the position to influenceSand at the same time be affected\nbySthe function of an information system in the domain. An illustrative example is the\nrecent establishment of NHS-wide networking, an interorganizational network which has\nbeen developed to improve the electronic exchange of information between the members\nof the British National Health Service (NHS Executive, 1994b). However, use of the\nnetwork is currently boycotted by the doctors, who believe that their patients\u2019 privacy is\nat stake (Davies, 1996). \nIn the following section we suggest a method for identifying these stakeholders, so that\ntheir different perspectives can be understood and used for a more realistic\ninterorganizational systems development.\nStakeholder identification\nThere is a broad divergence of views in the literature as to who should be considered a\nstakeholder. This is related to the fact that different researchers or practitioners use\nstakeholder analysis for different purposes or in a different context. For example,\nFreeman (1984) and Eden and van der Heijden (1993) use the concept of stakeholders\nprimarily as a tool for examining the external environment of a given organization. this\nis expected to assist managers with strategic decision making. Wood et al (1995) suggest\n9the use of stakeholder analysis in combination with other analysis approaches as part of\nan interpretive framework for business process reengineering. Preston and Sapienza\n(1990), Goodpaster (1993), Evan and Freeman (1993), Jones (1995) and others argue that\nstakeholder analysis is an ethical alternative to serving exclusively the interests of an\norganization\u2019s shareholders. In the information systems literature, the emphasis is often\non communication problems within the organizational environment; hence, many authors\nrefer to the different objectives of systems developers, decision makers, and other user\ngroups which are the stakeholders they consider (e.g. Galliers & Sutherland, 1991; Lee\n& Gough, 1993; Ruohonen, 1991; Lacity & Hirschheim, 1995). What is common in these\ndifferent approaches to stakeholder analysis is that they fail to provide a practical\ntechnique for actually identifying stakeholders. \nWhile in many cases even a definition or a specification of who the stakeholders are is\nomitted as self-explanatory (e.g. Galliers, 1995), other approaches base their analysis on\neither a list of stakeholders that are specific to a given context or suggest a checklist that\nincludes different, usually generic, types of stakeholders, a list which is implicitly\nconsidered to have universal value. In the first case, as for example in the OPADE project\n(Venot et al., 1992) where the patient, the prescriber, the care provider, the manager, the\ncommunity pharmacists and the hospital pharmacists are identified as some of the main\nstakeholders in the prescribing process, there is hardly an indication of how the particular\nstakeholders have been identified. Similarly Savage et al (1992) list a number of \u201ctypical\nkey stakeholders of a rural hospital\u201d in the United States but do not explain how these\nwere identified. In the second case, the identification of stakeholders rests on the\nidentification of broad categories of internal or external actors that are taken to be valid\nfor all organizations (e.g. Richardson & Richardson, 1992; Hill & Jones, 1992; Wallace,\n1995). Freeman (1984) goes a step further, suggesting that a generic stakeholder list\nshould eventually lead to the identification of specific stakeholders (e.g. competitor A\nand competitor B rather than \u2018competitors\u2019). While in both cases the importance of\n10\nidentifying the stakeholders is recognized, the stakeholders emerge as the end product of\na process of stakeholder identification which is not explained.\nOne of the major problems of the lack of a systematic stakeholder identification approach\nis that generic stakeholder lists are not appropriate for all contexts. For example, generic\nstakeholder lists would fail to identify all relevant information systems stakeholders, first\nbecause distinct stakeholder groups such as the systems\u2019 developers and users are not\nincluded on the generic stakeholder groups suggested in the strategic management\nliterature and second  because:\n\u201c[I]n the literature, IS stakeholders fall into three main groups: users,\nmanagement, and IS professionals. Unfortunately, this classification is\nmuch too coarse and, in most cases, inadequate, as it conveys the role\nprescriptions associated with the design of an IS. It does not reveal the\nactors\u2019 actual interests with regard to IS; instead, it focuses on intended\nand observable aspects, ignores conflicts inside these three groups (cf.\nMarkus 1983; Kling & Iacono 1984; Franz & Robey 1984), and provides\na much too simplistic view of the IS and how it affects an organization\u2019s\nmembers\u2019 interests\u201d (Lyytinen & Hirschheim, 1987, p. 262).\nIt is worth noting that the only significant attempt at a more systematic approach to\nstakeholder identification comes from Lyytinen and Hirschheim (1987) who suggest four\ncriteria to guide the stakeholder identification process: (1) the nature of information\nsystems, i.e. more stakeholders can be identified if the information system is seen from\ndifferent perspectives: symbolic, communicative and organizational dimensions of the\nsystem are as important as the technological dimension (2) the type of relationship of the\nstakeholder to the information system, (3) the direct or indirect \u2018depth of impact\u2019, (4) the\nlevel of aggregation which may vary between individual, groups or larger collectives. In\na later paper, Lyytinen (1998) adds the external vs. internal dimension as a fifth criterion.\n11\nIn the interorganizational systems literature, the criteria that have implicitly been used are\nthe second and third, as researchers have concentrated in two distinct groups of\nstakeholders (even though the term stakeholder is not necessarily used): those initiating\nand sustaining the systems (\u2018hubs\u2019 or \u2018sponsors\u2019) and those participating (\u2018spokes\u2019 or\n\u2018adapters\u2019). This distinction is very useful for studying the different roles of these groups,\nthe different advantages they accrued or expect from the interorganizational systems as\nwell as the different options that they have in setting their strategic direction (e.g.\nWebster, 1995; Reekers & Smithson, 1996; Cavaye, 1995b). However, the distinction\nbetween \u2018hub and spokes\u2019 is not applicable in all interorganizational systems applications\nand is particularly inadequate in complex domains, such as that of drug use management.\nOne approach that has been used as a theoretical tool for the study of interorganizational\nsystems (e.g. in Cunningham & Tynan, 1993; Reekers, 1995) is the network approach,\nwhich has been used in the social network literature (e.g. Knoke & Kuklinski, 1982;\nScott, 1991) and in the industrial network approach (e.g. Axelsson & Easton, 1992;\nH\u00e5kansson, 1987; H\u00e5kansson, 1989). This is very relevant for interorganizational systems\nbecause it focuses on the broad network of relationships between firms rather than on a\nsingle firm or individual relationship. In particular, the network consists of three closely\ninterlinked components: actors, resources and activities. Some important characteristics\nof this approach, which are relevant to our discussion of stakeholders, are the premises\nthat a network is heterogeneous, dynamic, \u201cstable but not static\u201d (Easton, 1992, p. 23)\nand as such, that it \u201calways contains an element of both cooperation and conflict\u201d\n(H\u00e5kansson, 1989, p. 16)\nThe definition of actors in a network, \u201cthose who perform activities and\/or control\nresources within a certain field\u201d (H\u00e5kansson, 1987, p. 14), closely resembles our\ndefinition of interorganizational systems stakeholders, although it does not encompass\nthose who at a given time are passive recipients of (although affected by) the actions of\n12\nthe network. The similarity of the concepts of actors and stakeholders and the relevance\nof the network approach to interorganizational systems creates an interesting opportunity\nto bring together the stakeholder analysis and the network approaches. In this paper,\nhowever, we will limit the integration of the approaches to the issue of stakeholder\nidentification. \nAxelsson (1992) argues that \u201cto identify who the actors are in certain situations is one of\nthe primary issues\u201d (p.195) but fails to provide a mechanism for identifying actors (or\nstakeholders). It is our intention in this paper to bring together ideas from the network\nand the stakeholder analysis approaches, as well as the interorganizational systems\nliterature, to suggest a systematic and comprehensive approach to stakeholder\nidentification. In order to ensure that this approach leads to drawing a dynamic picture\nof the domain, we avoid creating a model which would be more likely to reveal only\nstatic instances of stakeholder topography. Since we take an interpretive stance\n(Walsham, 1993), we do not envisage creating a single stakeholder map. \nInstead, our approach aims at understanding how stakeholders are perceived in this\ndomain and is based on a number of principles that characterize the behaviour of\nstakeholders. These principles, primarily heuristic in nature, are derived from our\npreliminary research in the area of drug use management but have been subsequently\nverified by similar ideas in the stakeholder analysis and the network literature. They have\ntherefore assisted us in identifying further stakeholders in the domain under investigation.\nWe believe that the use of these principles to identify stakeholders results in a flexible\nand dynamic technique that allows modifications according to the particular context and\nat different points in time. These principles are examined in detail in the following\nparagraphs.\n13\nPrinciple 1. Stakeholders depend on the specific context and time frame\nWe have given some examples of authors who consider the environment of a business\norganization as having similar types of stakeholders, regardless of the actual type of\nbusiness (e.g. Richardson & Richardson, 1992; Hill & Jones, 1992; Wallace, 1995). This\nis reasonable in as far as decision makers in an organization need to consider employees,\ncustomers, suppliers, competitors etc. as broadly defined groups that affect and are\naffected by the organization\u2019s behaviour. However, a detailed identification of\nstakeholders will eventually come up with different groups of stakeholders, depending\non which organization\u2019s or which system\u2019s stakeholders one seeks to identify. The\ndomain in which an organization or system operates also affects the set of stakeholders.\nFor example, \u2018competition\u2019 means different things in the public and in the private sector,\nso that \u2018competitors\u2019 is an inadequate generalization for an organizational stakeholder.\nAlso, customers of different products of the same company, or customers with different\nattitudes to the same product, may need to be examined separately (Freeman, 1984). \nThus, although general groupings of stakeholders can be useful as a guideline, context\nremains of primary importance for ensuring that appropriate individuals, groups or\norganizations are considered. As time goes by, changes in context lead to further changes,\nwhich will probably be reflected in the set of stakeholders. The importance of the context,\nor the environment within which an organization operates has been addressed in detail\nin the organization theory literature (e.g. Emery & Trist, 1965; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967)\nas well as in the study of interorganizational relations (e.g. H\u00e5kansson, 1989; Forsgren\net al 1995). Forsgren et al (1995) in particular stress the importance of time in business\nrelationships and argue that \u201cthe relationships have a past and a future. They cannot even\nbe conceived without history\u201d (p. 25). The importance of context has also been stressed\nin the information systems literature (e.g. Checkland, 1981; Lederer & Mendelow, 1990;\nWalsham, 1993) and more recently in the interorganizational systems literature (e.g.\n14\nBensaou & Venkatraman, 1996; Cavaye, 1995b; Klein, 1996; Orlikowski et al, 1995;\nReekers, 1995). The implication for stakeholder identification is that it needs to be a\ndynamic process, that can afford the instability and uncertainty of organizational reality,\nwhereby new players enter the domain while others choose or are being forced to leave\n(Malone et al, 1989, give examples of how this may happen in the case of electronic\nmarkets).\nPrinciple 2: Stakeholders cannot be viewed in isolation\nIt is evident from the previous discussion that each stakeholder cannot be viewed as a\nsingle entity of the interorganizational arena. Rather, it is the interrelations between the\ndifferent stakeholders that make up one of the most interesting components of the study\nof stakeholder behaviour; they reveal a complex network of interactions, interests and\npower games. Indeed, some of the interactions can be visible and direct, such as formal\nexchange of information, or more subtle and indirect whereby an action by a market\nleader can impact decisions by others. Although the complexity of these relations is\nrecognized in the industrial network literature (for example, H\u00e5kansson, 1989 argues that\n\u201crelationships involve exchanges, and therefore in themselves represent activities\u201d (p.\n22), and are thus a key component of the network and Easton, 1992 (pp. 25-26), argues\nthat the focal relationship \u201ccannot be managed in isolation from the other relationships\na firm has\u201d),  the emphasis in the interorganizational systems literature often rests with\nexploring the one-to-one relationship of the organization under investigation with each\nparticular stakeholder separately or with a group of stakeholders (e.g. \u2018hub and spokes\u2019\n(Webster, 1995) or sponsor and adaptor (Cavaye, 1995b) relationships). Also, most\nstakeholder analysis approaches, because they adopt the perspective of the focal\norganization (e.g. Mason & Mitroff, 1981), emphasise the interrelations of each\nstakeholder separately with the focal organization. The approaches of Freeman (1984)\nand Eden and van Heijden (1993) are broader in this respect, as they consider the power\n15\nand interest of the different stakeholders, but these are also judged in respect to the focal\norganization and are not used in the process of stakeholder identification. In a complex\ndomain such analyses are likely to be inadequate. Isolated study of one-to-one\nrelationships maybe particularly misleading because an over-simplistic view of reality is\nadopted, ignoring the importance of a \u2018stakeholder\u2019s stakeholders\u2019. \nPrinciple 3: The position of each stakeholder may change over time\nAs the number of stakeholders and their interrelationships change over time, their roles\nand standpoints can be directly affected. This can be realized for a number of reasons,\nsome of which are presented here. First, a particular stakeholder may participate in more\nthan one stakeholder category, which may have differentSand possibly\nconflictingSobjectives and priorities. For example, individuals can be part of the\norganization where they are employed, and where they hold specific positions, be part of\na professional association and at the same time participate in a software development\nproject as a representative of the system\u2019s users. In this case, even the same person may\nat different times \u2018wear different hats\u2019, i.e. have a different role, different responsibilities\nand follow different agendas.\nSecond, changes in the environment, such as changes in legislation or the available\ntechnology, may have significant effects in the relationships between various\nstakeholders. For example, the establishment of EDI links between organizations can\nredefine organizational boundaries as well as the traditional \u2018customer\u2019 and \u2018supplier\u2019\nroles (Cash & Konsynski, 1985; Hoogeweegen, 1995). \nAlso, stakeholders may be forced to change their position relative to other stakeholders,\n\u2018adapt\u2019 (H\u00e5kansson, 1989) or in fact, may benefit from an opportunity to do so, as other\n16\nstakeholders react to changes in the organizational environment, imitating or leading in\nthe application of new plans, structures, programs.\nPrinciple 4: Feasible options may differ from the stakeholders\u2019 wishes\nBecause stakeholders often have different interests (e.g. Eden, 1996; Lyytinen, 1988;\nWallace, 1995), they follow different agendas and try to achieve different goals. Given\nthat these goals may be conflicting, the most likely scenaria for the future may not\ncorrespond to the wishes of all stakeholders, particularly as they need to adapt in the\ncontext of interorganizational relations (H\u00e5kansson, 1989). Other reasons that a\nstakeholder\u2019s vision of the future may not come about may simply be that this vision is\nnot realistic. Also, stakeholders may be unable to plan effectively for the realization of\ntheir wishes. Finally, environmental factors, including the lack of technological means\nor human skills, as well as adverse moves from other more powerful stakeholders, may\nrender certain desirable changes impossible. \nImplications for stakeholder identification and analysis\nWe have discussed how these four principles presented in the previous paragraphs are\nsupported in theory. We also found that they were supported in practice, as illustrated in\nthe next section. However, we found that they have not been explicitly stated or used in\nexisting stakeholder analysis approaches. Most importantly, they have not been applied\nto support the identification of stakeholders or to provide practical guidelines for the\nidentification of stakeholders by other researchers. This can be the result of a number of\nreasons. On the one hand, a single, generic, and hence \u2018context free\u2019 stakeholder map is\nsimpler to analyze and explain in broad terms the potential role of different types in\nstakeholders. On the other hand, for those authors concerned with conducting stakeholder\n17\nanalysis within a specific context (e.g. Savage et al, 1992), it seemed appropriate to\nidentify only the relevant stakeholders. Besides, as stakeholder analysis has tended to be\nused for only one organization, drawn only from the perspective of that organization\u2019s\nmanagement (Mason & Mitroff, 1981), the generation of multiple stakeholder maps did\nnot seem applicable or necessary. \nIt is our thesis that we must use all these principles if we intend to understand\norganizational and interorganizational reality, explain past circumstances and use the\nconclusions to plan realistically for future activity. For this purpose, we address the\nimplications that these principles have for the identification of a broad range of\nstakeholders in an interorganizational context.\nThe first principle, which assumes the contingency of who the stakeholders are on time\nand context, can be translated into two propositions for researchers. First, it is only\nmeaningful to draw a stakeholder map taking into account the particularities of the\ncontext and the domain under investigation. Second, any stakeholder map has to be\nregularly reviewed for changes over time. In other words, the generic checklists of\nstakeholder groups that are often suggested in the literature are inadequate for drawing\na realistic picture of a specific interorganizational environment at a given time, except\nperhaps momentarily.\nThe second principle stresses the importance of stakeholder interrelations, some of which\ncan be indirect and very complicated. Therefore, a stakeholder map cannot be regarded\nas complete if only direct links from a particular organization to other actors in the\nenvironment are considered. Instead, since we are interested in the broader network of\ninterorganizational links, we should examine how each stakeholder is linked with (e.g.\ncommunicates, exchanges information, influences or is influenced by) other stakeholders.\nIn practice, this signifies that in a complex domain the identification of one stakeholder\n18\ncan lead to the identification of others. Thus, the identification of stakeholders needs to\nbe an iterative process where the stakeholder map becomes continuously broader to cover\nall relevant stakeholders. \nAccording to the third principle, the position of stakeholders may change over time,\nwhich is often a result of the stakeholder\u2019s reaction to changes in the context (cf. first\nprinciple) or is also bound to be influenced by the history of the stakeholder and the\nstakeholder\u2019s stakeholders. The importance of the historical context (e.g. Walsham, 1993)\nmeans that we should not limit the investigation of the stakeholders or their viewpoints\nto a specific point in time. On the contrary, a long-term perspective that looks into the\nchanges of the stakeholders\u2019 viewpoints over time (also regarding their views of who the\nstakeholders are) is necessary to reveal the reasons behind previous decisions or courses\nof action and at the same time can serve as a guideline for exploring realistic future\nscenarios. In the case of interorganizational systems development, this may be important\nfor identifying stakeholders that are favourable or unfavourable to the systems. \nSimilarly, because the stakeholders have different ideas about appropriate future images,\nwhich they may or may not be able to realize (fourth principle), it is necessary to consider\nthe political issues that underpin stakeholder interrelations and result in changes in their\nrole and position over time. Clearly, the feasibility of a stakeholder\u2019s wishes will also be\ncontingent on economic and technological factors (e.g. is the suitable technology\navailable, at a price the stakeholder can afford?). Here, however, we particularly stress\nthe importance of politics as these are often less visible than (and possibly not\nindependent of) economic and technical constraints. The implication for stakeholder\nidentification and analysis is that power relations and the politics of the domain under\ninvestigation need to be considered so that changes in stakeholder status and behaviour\ncan be explained and, possibly, anticipated. \n19\nIn conclusion, within a specific context, the process of stakeholder identification and\nanalysis needs to be iterative, adopting a long-term perspective in exploring who the\nstakeholders are and which are their viewpoints. This idea of an iterative, evolutionary,\nlong-term process has already been described in a different context, namely knowledge\nacquisition for small and medium size enterprises (Whitley et al., 1992). The \u2018Spring\nModel\u2019 suggests a pragmatic approach to problem solving and decision making by\nguiding future action partly based on past situations. This is done in an evolutionary\nprocess that is not linear but follows a sequence of loops of incremental refinements.\nThese ideas can also be applied in the identification and analysis of stakeholders\u2019\nviewpoints in an interorganizational context (Pouloudi & Whitley, 1996). \nFinally, we should not that although it has been argued that \u201cnetworks are stable but not\nstatic\u201d (Easton, 1992, p. 23), the stability may not be true for all types of\ninterorganizational networks (Miles & Snow, 1992). Indeed, the moves of each\nstakeholder, whether tactical, strategic or reactive, are expected to affect the others, to a\ndegree that will often depend on the influence of the stakeholders who originated the\nchange. Coalitions or other forms of groupings can then alter the reactions of other\nstakeholders and are likely to generate further changes. As this instability alters the\npicture of the network of stakeholders over time, all stakeholders form different visions\nabout their future roles and act accordingly, to the extent that these reactions are not\nhindered by the movements of other stakeholders. These ideas become clearer in the\nfollowing section, where we apply the principles of stakeholder behaviour to identify\nstakeholders in the drug use management domain in the United Kingdom. \n20\nPreliminary findings\nThe purpose of this section is to illustrate both how the ideas of the previous section were\ndeveloped and how these ideas have in turn been used to explore the environment of drug\nuse management systems in the UK. \nDrug use management systems are information systems which electronically assist the\nmanagement of the drugs life cycle, that is their prescription, distribution and dispensing,\nas well as the monitoring and evaluation of these activities and any related policy making.\nStakeholder identification\nIn the drug use management domain, information needs to be exchanged across different\norganizations. What makes this information exchange more complex is the fact that\ndifferent organizations are concerned with different aspects of this information (e.g. some\nrecipients of information are interested in clinical aspects whereas others are more\ninterested in administrative data or in cost information). Having little prior understanding\nof the information needed to support drug use management or of the level of\ncomputerization in the domain, we started identifying the stakeholders of drug use\nmanagement systems by interviewing representatives from two \u2018obvious\u2019 stakeholder\ngroups: suppliers and users of such systems. It was obvious that users of drug use\nmanagement systems would be family doctors (GPs), pharmacies, and hospitals. We also\nexpected that representatives of the government would be stakeholders of the drug use\nmanagement process, but were uncertain of who these representatives or what their role\nwould be. Also, we considered pharmaceutical companies and patients as other obvious\nstakeholders of the process. These \u2018obvious\u2019 stakeholders are listed in the second column\nof Table 1. \n21\nIn order to enrich our understanding of the role of these stakeholders for drug use\nmanagement and identify further stakeholders a number of interviews were conducted\nwith respondents from the broad groups of stakeholders mentioned. More specifically,\nsix interviews were conducted formally at the sites of the respondents, two of which\n(Southmead Hospital and Royal Hampshire County Hospital) were hospital pharmacists\nusing a hospital information system to support their activities while two others (TDS\nHealthcare Systems and HBO & Company Computer Centre) were suppliers of hospital\ninformation systems. The fifth respondent was Boots The Chemists, a major chain of\npharmacy stores in Britain, and the sixth the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA), a\nspecial health authority within the NHS, mainly responsible for collecting and checking\nprescribing information and authorizing related payments; the information received is\nextremely rich and is then fed back to individual GPs and health agencies to audit\nprescription habits and expenditure. Brief meetings were also held with a representative\nfrom the Merck and Co., Inc. pharmaceutical company and with the director of LSE\nHealth Research Centre at the London School of Economics,  a general practitioner and\na nurse in a general practice with low level of computerization. \nDuring these interviews we used a topic guide as a checklist of issues to discuss and took\nhandwritten notes. At the end of each interview individual reports of the cases were\nproduced, presenting the issues that had been discussed during the interview. It is worth\nnoting that all the respondents were very willing to answer questions and describe the use\nand impact of information systems in the prescribing process. It is possible that the\nabsence of a tape-recorder, which could have been intimidating, helped them to talk\nfreely during the interview. Certainly their lengthy responses revealed their interest in the\ndomain of investigation as well as the fact that this domain is extremely rich in\ninformation.\n22\nAs a result of these interviews, and having studied the literature regarding the use of\ncomputer systems in the pharmaceutical domain in Britain (e.g. Gillies, 1995; Glinn et\nal, 1993; Lea & Morgan, 1993; Rogers et al, 1993; Sillince & Frost, 1993) we were able\nto refine our initial list of stakeholders. Thus, it became apparent that drug use\nmanagement systems suppliers are quite diversified. Suppliers of software are not\nnecessarily supplying hardware and vice versa; however, some do supply integrated\nsystems. Another important distinction is that suppliers of hospital systems are different\nfrom those who supply systems to general practitioners and different from those who\nsupply systems to pharmacies. Furthermore, there is also a number of drug databases\nproviders, who supply dictionaries of medical terms, databases of drugs, their indications,\ncounter-indications, interactions with other drugs and costs. \nAt the same time it became obvious that, within hospitals, users of drug use management\nsystems have different needs depending on their professional roles. Doctors, pharmacists\nand nurses were subsequently identified as stakeholders of drug use management\nsystems. Another important stakeholder identified in the course of this research was a\nuser group that was set up by one supplier of hospital systems to ensure that learning and\nexpertise were shared between suppliers and users as well as between users in different\nhospitals and in different countries. The complexity of the interorganizational system can\nbe seen in the differences in interpretation between the two groups. It is not surprising\nthat the role and success of this user group was interpreted differently by the supplier and\nby some hospital members. \nAlso, the Prescription Pricing Authority was identified as a stakeholder on the side of the\ngovernment, and the interview with them pointed to the role of the Department of Health\nin setting the nation\u2019s policy on health (and pharmaceuticals) and of health agencies, as\n\u2018purchasers\u2019 of health services from hospitals and fundholding general practices (i.e.\ngroups of GPs administering their own budget) on behalf of the local patient populations.\n23\nThe role of professional associations such as the British Medical Association (BMA) and\nthe Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was also pointed out and insurance\ncompanies, as third party payers for drugs were other stakeholders identified (third\ncolumn of table 1). \nThe process of stakeholder identification continued with further interviews with the\nstakeholders identified previously. For example, the discussion about drug safety led to\nthe identification of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) as a major stakeholder\nresponsible for deciding on and monitoring the safety, quality and efficacy of drugs.\nOther organizations were also identified as stakeholders because of their presence in\nevents that brought together the stakeholders already identified. Thus, further interviews\nwere conducted on a more informal basis, during the Exchanging Healthcare Information\nConference and Exhibition (EHI \u201994) and the Healthcare Computing Conference and\nExhibition (HC \u201995). Interviewees included EDI or GP systems providers, as well as\nrepresentatives from the NHS Executive, which is the body responsible for implementing\nthe directions set by the Department of Health in the NHS. In particular we met with\nmembers of the Information Management Group, which is responsible for improving the\nuse of information technology in the NHS. We also had brief meetings with\nrepresentatives from the CCTA (the government centre for information systems), the\nBritish Computer Society (BCS) and British Telecom (a main supplier of\ntelecommunication services in Britain). These interviews were significantly shorter in\nduration and the content was not always centred around the use of drug use management\nsystems, as many representatives of the organizations did not see themselves directly\ninvolved in either the use\/supply of information technology or in pharmaceuticals.\nHowever, we believe that they are clearly stakeholders in the drug use management\nprocess since their products affect the potential for information systems development. \n24\nThe identification of stakeholders that were not directly involved in drug use management\nhas been one of the benefits of this approach. Often these stakeholders themselves\ndoubted that they had anything to do with our research or whether they would be able to\ntell us anything useful. This response was not surprising given the fact that most\npresentations and representatives in the exhibitions at EHI \u201994 and HC \u201995  were\nconcerned with the health care provision as a whole rather than drug use management.\nWe consider them to be stakeholders despite the fact that they felt they had little direct\nimpact in our area of interest. This because (following the first principle) changes in the\nhealth care environment set the general context for drug use management (third column\nof table 1). \nIt is evident from the discussion in the preceding sections that these people and\norganizations (e.g. EDI suppliers, British Telecom, NHS Executive etc.) should be\nincluded in the stakeholder map. Considering their inclusion is one of the main strengths\nof a stakeholder analysis approach. Typically, these people would have been left out of\ntraditional information systems analyses of the domain. However, if these stakeholders\nare not considered, this could easily result in a failure to understand the current state of\nthe art in the use of information systems in health care provision as a whole. Indeed,\nmany of the interviewees in EHI \u201994 were concerned with networking between NHS\npartners, which was at the heart of this conference. In the long term, this is expected to\nhave major implications for the electronic exchange of information which, evidently, also\nserves the management of drug use processes.\nWe have argued that one of the strengths of the suggested approach is that a flexible\nprocess of stakeholder identification is proposed. This allows the identification of\nstakeholders that are particular to the specific context and is based on the idea that each\nstakeholder identified can lead to the identification of others, this process often results\n25\nin the identification of stakeholders that initially seem only indirectly related to the\nresearch problem. \nIn practice, this approach to stakeholder identification can be translated to four steps that\nare carried out iteratively by the analyst. First, some obvious generic groups of\nstakeholders are identified, using for example the suggestions in relevant literature. In our\ncase, because of our particular interest in information systems, we started by identifying\ninformation systems users and suppliers as two first broad categories of stakeholders.\nSecond, the analysts contact representatives from these initial stakeholder groups. In\ndepth interviews are conducted to understand both the stakeholder\u2019s perceptions about\nthe environment (who are other stakeholders, what is their relation with the interviewee,\nwhat is the role and influence of the various stakeholders, what are the politics\nunderpinning the activities in the domain) and the perceptions of the interviewee about\nthe use of (interorganizational) information systems in the domain over time,\nemphasizing on what are desirable and what are feasible future options. Rather than\nasking the stakeholders directly \u2018who do you think other stakeholders are?\u2019 the different\nanswers to this question derived as a result of an open discussion about, in our case, the\ndevelopment and use of drug use management systems. Following the interviews, a\nfourth stage includes the revision of the stakeholder map by the analyst to accommodate\nany newly brought out perceptions. Using the new images, the analyst should continue\nthe process by approaching newly identified stakeholders, approaching them, integrating\ntheir perceptions with previous analysis findings and so on. \nTable 2 indicates how, following this process, our initial ideas about stakeholders in the\ndomain expanded during the different stages of the research. Although we have argued\nthat different stakeholders have different ideas about who other stakeholders are, in this\ntable we have included all the stakeholders identified and have thus chosen not to\nrepresent the interpretive character of the process. This diversity of views about who the\n26\nstakeholders are has, however, been clear in the interviews. For example, while\npharmaceutical companies would clearly perceive the Medicines Control Agency as a\nstakeholder, suppliers of computer systems to hospitals would not. Nevertheless, the\ndecisions of the MCA affects drug databases and their suppliers, thus they have an\nindirect impact for suppliers of integrated solutions to drug use management users. Given\nthis complexity of links, particularly between those associated indirectly, we expect this\nexpanding list of stakeholders to be further enriched as more stakeholders are contacted.\nFrom the presentation of the results so far, it is evident how the practical implications\nsuggested in the theory section have been used in practice. Because this was a new\nresearch area for us, we used domain-specific literature and interviews with \u2018obvious\u2019\nstakeholders to identify relevant stakeholders for drug use management (implication of\nthe first principle). We also carried out an iterative stakeholder identification process, as\nis evident from the drawing of table 1 (implication of the second principle). The attention\nto the historical context and the relative power of different stakeholders (implications of\nthe third and fourth principles) have been valuable for guiding the interview process and\nunderstanding better why the use of drug use management systems was following specific\ndirections or why certain stakeholders became more or less important. \nOne example that illustrates how the principles of stakeholders behaviour were verified\nin practice in the drug use management domain is the use of information systems for\ngeneral medical practice. \nIn the past, many general practitioners (GPs) chose to develop their own software or\npurchased inexpensive software, aiming at what they perceived to be cost-effective\nsolutions. However, an increasing number of GPs find themselves in a position where\nthis attitude has to be reconsidered. For one thing, the current push from the NHS for\nelectronic exchange of information (NHS-wide networking), for example by establishing\n27\ncommunication links between GPs and Health Agencies for registration changes and item\nof service claims, has made the adoption of standards at a national level necessary. At the\nsame time, the Requirements for Accreditation for General Medical Practice Computer\nSystems (NHS Executive, 1994a) have provided GPs with the incentive to move towards\nmore sophisticated computer systems that satisfied the criteria and standards set by the\nNHS. In other words, the priorities of GPs in selecting information systems have changed\nover time, due to the need to improve the communication links with other stakeholders\n(health agencies) and as a result of the involvement of other external stakeholders (NHS\nInformation Management Group) that were in a position to use incentives to that end.\nThese changes had severe implications for the suppliers of GP systems: many of those\nthat could not meet the requirements for sophisticated solutions were unable to survive\nin the market. Table 2 summarizes the four principles of stakeholder behaviour and their\npractical implications and illustrates how the example of GP information systems relates\nto each of these.\nExamples of the viewpoints of the stakeholders \nThe identification of stakeholders is already an important contribution to unveiling the\ncomplexity of the drug use management domain. However, it is necessary to move\nbeyond the identification of stakeholders to an understanding of their roles and\ninterrelations, and their viewpoints about the role of information systems, as this is\nexpected to affect the future of the development and use of drug use management\nsystems. In this section we shall briefly consider some of the results of this research in\nexploring the viewpoints of stakeholders about the role of information systems in the\ndomain. These findings are drawn from both the literature and the interviews.\n28\nFirst, the introduction and use of drug use management systems bring about changes in\nthe stakeholders\u2019 perceptions about the whole drug management process. For example,\npharmaceutical companies perceive the complexity of prescription process as a result of\nthe need to serve four different customers: according to a recent interview with Merck\u2019s\nformer Chief Executive Officer in the Harvard Business Review (Nichols, 1994), the\npharmaceutical industry operates in a uniquely complex marketplace, where companies\nneed to serve at the same time those sponsoring their products, those prescribing, those\ndispensing and those consuming them.\nThe ability of these companies to influence their \u2018four customers\u2019 changes as a result of\nnew information systems which can lead to new market opportunities and changes in the\nstructure of the companies. However, they are still restricted by legislation concerning\ntheir freedom to approach these customers with their new products. This may change\nhowever and drug manufacturers could benefit from existing EDI links to market such\nproducts electronically.\nFrom the perspective of drug prescribers, it seems that GPs use more sophisticated\ncomputer systems that hospital doctors. These differences between the general practice\nand the hospital setting can serve as an indication of how the perceptions of the\nstakeholders can change over time and how the complexity of the environment can\ninterfere with the progress in information systems implementation. Thus, while GPs have\nbecome familiar with computerized prescription practices, information systems in\nhospital pharmacies are still mostly used, according to the respondents, to support\ndispensing and stock control of drugs.\nOn-line prescribing is, in general, not available in hospitals, and some respondents found\nit doubtful whether the facility would be beneficial, given the amount and cost of input\nthat would be needed. At the same time, the dispensing and stock control functions of the\n29\nsystems were well accepted by the users, because they were easy to use and did not cause\nany important changes in the working practices. The lack of integration of these systems\nto the information systems used elsewhere in the same hospital, as in the case of\nSouthmead hospital, prevented doctors from accessing information on prescriptions as\nwell as pharmacists from accessing information about patients and interventions on drug\ntherapies.\nIn hospitals that implemented a hospital information system, as in the case of Hampshire,\nthe integration of information was better and assured a better information flow,\nminimization of duplication and better reporting facilities. It facilitated the administration\nof drugs and hospital administration in general and allowed for other functions such as\nthe broadcasting of messages throughout the hospital. However, an integrated system\nseems to be more vulnerable to security problems. Indeed, although electronic access had\nbeen allowed according to profession and seniority, some security breaches have occurred\nwhen doctors asked nurses to use the system on their behalf. This \u2018fraud\u2019 was only\nrevealed when the nurses complained about the extra work they were requested to do. \nFinally, we should note that the stakeholders of drug use management systems are more\nthan just the participants in any one system development project. An interesting example\narises as a result of the UK Government\u2019s reforms of the National Health Service. These\nreforms have created a large number of independent Hospital Trusts which are\nresponsible for managing their own budgets. These trusts do not normally have the funds\nto develop hospital information systems from scratch. Thus, they either purchase off-the-\nshelf systems which they tailor to their specific requirements or the supplier of the system\nmay put them in contact with other users of the supplied software (often American\nhospitals) to pool their experiences and expertise. As a result, the evolution of these\nsystems may be influenced by hospitals working under a very different cultural and\nlegislative regime (Avgerou, 1994).\n30\nIn conclusion, the examples of drug use management systems and their perceptions\ndescribed in this section illustrate that there are no \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 practices for the\ndevelopment of information systems. Rather, it is a great number of factors that need to\nbe considered and which cannot become apparent unless the viewpoints of the\nstakeholders are revealed. This paper has provided some evidence of the diversity of\nexisting viewpoints. These need to be further explored so that the wishes of the\nstakeholders can be taken into account in order to promote and develop more feasible\ninterorganizational systems solutions. \nConclusions\nThis paper began by introducing the notion of stakeholders in the context of\ninter-organizational information systems. We suggested that all the individuals, groups\nor organizations whose actions can influence the development of the systemSwhether\ndirectly or indirectlySshould be regarded as stakeholders since they have a potentially\nimportant role to play in the initial and continuing development of interorganizational\nsystems. \nIn order to help with the identification of stakeholders, we have suggested that this is a\nprocess that is subject to a number of principles. These ideas were applied to a\npreliminary study of the drug use management process in the United Kingdom and\nquickly showed that the range of potential stakeholders is far wider than first thought.\nThe examples given in this paper are only a starting point, but do demonstrate the utility\nof applying stakeholder analysis to the problem of developing information systems for\ndrug use management by revealing the underlying complexity of decision making in the\ndomain.  \n31\nThe main contribution of this paper is to suggest a practical method for the identification\nof stakeholders; this is a process that is very important in complex domains, such as that\nof drug use management. However, it has been overlooked in the stakeholder literature\nas well as in its application in the information systems literature. By applying our\napproach in a domain where information is exchanged between different stakeholders,\nwe have also shown how the industrial network approach and the interorganizational\nsystems literature relate to stakeholder analysis. \nStill, further work is required to complete the different images of the stakeholder map as\nthis is understood by the broad range of stakeholders. This entails investigating in further\ndetail the roles of the various stakeholders; the perception of stakeholders about the need\nfor information systems, especially interorganizational at different stages of the drug use\nmanagement process; the types of links that exist between the different stakeholders (are\nthey direct or indirect, can they be facilitated through the use of electronic means, how\nstrong these links are, are the relations characterised by collaboration or conflict etc.); the\nrelative importance of stakeholders (although we have already shown evidence that\ndifferent stakeholders have different perceptions about who is \u2018important\u2019). This last\nquestion depends not only on the perceptions of the stakeholders but also on the different\ncriteria that could be applied to that end. For example, interest and power are suggested\nby Freeman (1984) as two dimensions that can be used for representing the relative\npositions of stakeholders. It is interesting to consider whether these dimension are\nrelevant, reliable and adequate for considering the relative importance of stakeholders.\nIn the context of drug use management systems, we should eventually consider what each\nof the stakeholders would like to do next and compare it with what they are likely to do\nnext, thus providing a clearer understanding of the further evolution of drug use\nmanagement systems. Furthermore, based on the perceptions of the various stakeholders,\n32\nalternative plans can be developed for action, and these tested for their feasibility using,\nagain, the viewpoints of the stakeholders identified. \nDespite the importance of this approach in enhancing our understanding of a complex\ndomain where interorganizational systems are in use, it has two important and closely\ninterrelated problems. First, it is difficult to decide where the stakeholder identification\nprocess should stop. Because of its iterative character, there is a danger of identifying\nliterally everybody as a stakeholder. In practice however, we found that the number of\nnew stakeholders identified is, after some \u2018iterations\u2019, of the process significantly\ndecreasing. The second related problem is that as more stakeholders are identified, there\nare more likely to be conflicting accounts of the situation. This on one hand enhances our\nunderstanding of the context but on the other hand can create problems for those wishing\nto take action. The management of conflict in an interorganizational context is highly\ncomplex and difficult to address (see for example Kumar et al, 1995) and can indeed\nhinder or delay decision making. Still, the advantage of stakeholder analysis is that it\nhighlights conflicts and does not let decision makers make naive assumptions about the\nadoption of interorganizational systems. The case of NHS-wide networking, where\nsignificant stakeholders\u2019 views had been overlooked shows that unless these are taken\ninto account a huge information systems investment may collapse (Willcox, 1995). \nWe believe that a major benefit from the use of stakeholder analysis in the context of\ninterorganizational systems development is that it can highlight issues that other\napproaches would neglect, in particular in relation to the different viewpoints of\nstakeholders and their evolution over time. We hope that by suggesting a systematic\napproach to the identification of interorganizational stakeholders we have assisted\ninformation analysts and decision makers who lack flexible methods to assist them in\nunveiling and analysing multiple stakeholder perspectives. \n33\n34\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to all those who contributed to this research.
