Efficient one-carbon\nmetabolism requires other B vitamins and the optimal activity of enzymes including 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).\nWe report a population-based case\u2013control study of folate intake, related dietary factors and MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, A1298C) and color-\nectal cancer in a population with relatively high colorectal cancer incidence and relatively low folate intake. A total of 264 cases with histologi-\ncally confirmed incident colorectal cancer and 408 controls participated. There was no clear trend in risk with reported intakes of total, or dietary,\nfolate, riboflavin, vitamin B12 or vitamin B6, nor were there interactions between folate intake and the other B vitamins or alcohol. For C677T, risk\ndecreased with increasing variant alleles (multivariate OR for CT v. CC \u00bc 0\u00b777 (95% CI 0\u00b752, 1\u00b716); OR for TT v. CC \u00bc 0\u00b762 (95% CI 0\u00b731,\n1\u00b724)), which, although not statistically significant, was consistent with previous studies. For A1298C, compared with AA subjects, CC subjects\nhad modest, non-significant, reduced risk (multivariate OR \u00bc 0\u00b781 (95% CI 0\u00b745, 1\u00b749)). There were significant interactions between total folate\nand C677T (P\u00bc0\u00b7029) and A1298C (P\u00bc0\u00b7025), and total vitamin B6 and both polymorphisms (C677T, P\u00bc0\u00b7016; A1298C, P\u00bc0\u00b7033), although\nthe patterns observed differed from previous studies. Seen against the setting of low folate intake, the results suggest that the role of folate\nmetabolism in colorectal cancer aetiology may be more complex than previously thought. Investigation of particular folate vitamers (for example,\ntetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) may help clarify carcinogenesis pathways.\nFolate: MTHFR: Colorectal cancer: One-carbon metabolism\nFolate, and its synthetic form, folic acid, is key in one-carbon\nmetabolism, the disruption of which can interfere with DNA\nsynthesis, repair and methylation. Low folate status or, more\ngenerally, low dietary methyl status (a combination of\nfolate, methionine, alcohol and other B vitamins) may pro-\nmote carcinogenesis. The mechanisms by which low folate\ncould increase risk of malignancy include: (1) DNA hypo-\nmethylation and inappropriate activation of oncogenes1; and\/\nor (2) uracil misincorporation during DNA repair and syn-\nthesis, leading to DNA strand breaks, chromosome damage\nand, eventually, malignant transformation2. Higher reported\nfolate intake has been associated with reduced colorectal\ncancer risk3. However, most studies have been conducted in\npopulations where intake is relatively high, and a substantial\nproportion comes in the form of folic acid, either from\nsupplements or through fortified foods; folic acid is more bio-\navailable than natural folates4.\nEfficient one-carbon metabolism also requires riboflavin,\nvitamin B6, vitamin B12 and methionine. This raises the possi-\nbility that these factors, either on their own account, or by\nacting together with folate, might influence colorectal cancer\nrisk. However, the available evidence is limited and\/or incon-\nsistent5.\nOne-carbon metabolism further requires the optimal activity\nof multiple enzymes, including 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofo-\nlate reductase (MTHFR), which directs the folate pool towards\nmethylation or DNA repair. Several polymorphisms have been\nreported in the MTHFR gene, but only two have been investi-\ngated in relation to colorectal neoplasia \u2013 C677T and\nA1298C5. The 677T variant lowers enzyme activity in vitro6\n*Corresponding author: Dr Linda Sharp, fax \u00fe 353 21 4318016, email linda.sharp@ncri.ie\nAbbreviation: MTHFR, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.\nBritish Journal of Nutrition (2008), 99, 379\u2013389 doi: 10.1017\/S0007114507801073\nq The Authors 2007\nB\nri\nti\nsh\nJo\nu\nrn\nal\no\nf\nN\nu\ntr\nit\nio\nn\nand has been associated with decreased plasma folate and\nvitamin B12 levels and raised homocysteine\n7,8. In vitro studies\nsuggest that low folate status may be required for this poly-\nmorphism to affect enzyme activity in vivo9,10. The functional\nimpact of the A1298C polymorphism is less clear5,11. In vitro\nenzyme activity appears to be reduced in homozygous variants\nand compound heterozygotes10,12,13, but the in vivo effects\nremain to be determined.\nMost, but not all, previous studies have found reduced col-\norectal cancer risk in homozygotes for the variant C677T\nallele5,14. A1298C has been less extensively investigated,\nand results have been inconsistent5,15. The inconsistencies\nmay be due, in part, to differences in genotype distributions\nand folate intakes between populations.\nThe Scottish diet is distinguished by low vegetable intake16.\nThis suggests folate levels may be relatively low, a view con-\nfirmed by the National Food Survey which revealed geo-\ngraphical variations in blood folate across Britain, with the\nlowest levels in Scotland17. The high alcohol intake18 and\nsmoking prevalence19 may further compromise folate and,\nmore generally, methyl status in the Scottish population.\nFurthermore, colorectal cancer incidence in Scotland is in\nthe upper quarter of rates observed worldwide20.\nWe undertook a population-based case\u2013control study in\nthe north-east of Scotland to investigate whether intakes of\nfolate and related dietary factors, and MTHFR polymorphisms,\nwere associated with colorectal cancer risk in a population\nwith a relatively low folate intake.\nMaterials and methods\nAscertainment of cases and controls\nEligible cases were resident in the Grampian Health Board\nregion and diagnosed with a histological confirmed first pri-\nmary invasive tumour of the colon or rectum between\nSeptember 1998 and February 2000. They were identified\neach month from the computerised records of Aberdeen\nRoyal Infirmary pathology laboratory, which provides the cen-\ntralised service for Grampian.\nControls were selected from the Grampian Community\nHealth Index, an inventory of everyone registered with a gen-\neral practitioner. The Grampian Community Health Index has\na high level of completeness for the Grampian population21.\nEach month, a pool of potential controls was selected at\nrandom, frequency matched to cases on age and sex. Individ-\nuals who declined to take part were replaced.\nThe study was approved by the Joint Ethical Committee of\nthe University of Aberdeen and Grampian Health Board\n(Scotland, UK). All participants gave informed consent.\nAssessment of diet and other exposures\nWith the permission of their general practitioner, subjects\nwere recruited by post. They completed a questionnaire com-\nprising a 150-item semi-quantitative FFQ22 plus questions on\na range of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors relevant to\ncolorectal cancer aetiology. The FFQ had been validated in\nthe local population23 and included questions on dietary\nsupplement use in the reference period (approximately 1\nyear before completion).\nGenotyping\nSubjects provided a mouthwash sample. DNA was extracted\nfrom exfoliated buccal cells using the Elucigene CF12 proto-\ncol (Zeneca Diagnostics, Abingdon, Oxon, UK) and amplified\nby PCR. The amplification products were digested with HinfI\nfor C677T7 and MboII for A1298C24. Resultant products were\nseparated by electrophoresis through 3% (Metaphorw, FMC\nBioProducts) gels. Bands were visualised by ethidium bromide\nstaining and UV transillumination.\nAnalyses were blind to case\u2013control status. Each batch\ncontained a negative (no template DNA) and two positive\ncontrols. Analyses were repeated if either amplification or\ndigestion failed. Gels were double-read by two individuals\nand assays repeated for any samples considered ambiguous.\nGenotyping was also repeated, blind to the original results,\nfor a 10% random selection (n 67) of samples; no differ-\nences were found compared with the originally assigned\ngenotypes.\nStatistical analysis\nThe dietary data were converted into estimated nutrient\nintakes using the UK national food composition tables,\ntaking account of cereal fortification25. For seven subjects\n(three cases and four controls) the FFQ was not completed\nor was very incomplete. A further twelve subjects (six cases\nand six controls) were excluded on the basis of implausible\ntotal energy intakes (, 3347 kJ\/d for men or , 2092 kJ\/d\nfor women26 or more than three standard deviations above\nmean intake in men and women separately). Protein intake\nwas used as a surrogate for methionine. Dietary intakes\nwere adjusted for total energy using the nutrient residual\nmethod26. For folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and riboflavin,\nthe primary analyses related to total intake, i.e. the sum of\ndietary (energy adjusted) and supplement intakes; secondary\nanalyses related to dietary intake. Subjects were grouped\ninto intake tertiles (for alcohol) or quartiles (other variables),\nbased on the combined case and control distribution27, with\nthe baseline group comprising non-consumers (alcohol) or\nthe lowest quartile. For methyl content, the \u2018low\u2019 group com-\nprised low total folate and protein (, median) and high\nalcohol (upper two tertiles) and the \u2018high\u2019 group had high\ntotal folate and protein ($ median) and low alcohol (no\nintake or lowest tertile).\nFor C677T and A1298C, separate and compound geno-\ntype was assigned. Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium was\nassessed in controls using Pearson\u2019s x2. Association analyses\nwere done for individual genotypes, and combining carriers\nof the variant alleles, taking homozygotes for the common\nallele as the reference group. In addition, to explore the\nimpact of one variant in the absence of the other, risk esti-\nmates were computed for (i) C677T genotype among\n1298AA carriers and (ii) A1298C genotypes among\n677CC carriers. Logistic regression was used to compute\nadjusted and multivariate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI in\nStata 8 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Adjusted\nOR were adjusted for sex, age and, for the dietary variables,\ntotal energy intake. Multivariate OR were further adjusted\nfor potential confounders; factors which made a significant\ncontribution (likelihood ratio test P,0\u00b71) were retained in\nL.

Trend tests28 were used to investigate dose\u2013\nresponse across dietary quantiles or by number of variant\nalleles. Effect modification was explored by computing OR\nfor combinations of (i) intake variables and (ii) intake and\ngenotype. The test for interaction was the change in\ndeviance (22 \u00a3 log likelihood) between a main-effects\nmodel and one including a cross-product term. All multi-\nvariate models were checked for adequate fit29.\nResults\nA total of 264 cases (62% of those eligible) and 408 controls\n(61%) participated. Of the 264 cases, 189 cases had colon\ncancer and seventy-five rectal cancer (Table 1). Cases\ntended to be older than controls, and a higher proportion\nwere men.\nMedian total folate intake was 299\u00b77 (interquartile range\n263\u00b79\u2013348\u00b76) mg\/d (Table 2). Median dietary folate was 295\n(interquartile range 261\u2013332) mg\/d. Of the subjects, 9\u00b75%\n(thirty-eight controls (9\u00b74%) and twenty-five cases (9\u00b76%))\nreported taking a supplement that contained folic acid. The\nmajority (fifty-three out of sixty-three) took supplements that\nincluded 200mg folic acid.\nFor total folate intake, the multivariate OR exceeded unity\nfor quartiles 2\u20134, but there was no clear trend (Table 2).\nA similar pattern was observed for total riboflavin. There\nwas a borderline significant association between protein\nintake and risk (global P\u00bc0\u00b7055; P(linear trend)\u00bc0\u00b7066),\ndue to a one-third reduction in risk in the highest intake\ngroup. Compared with non-drinkers, disease risk was slightly,\nbut non-significantly, raised for all categories of alcohol\nintake. The association was strongest in males (multivariate\nOR for T1 v. none \u00bc 1\u00b758 (95% CI 0\u00b760, 4\u00b715); OR for T2\nv. none \u00bc 1\u00b757 (95% CI 0\u00b765, 3\u00b780); OR for T3 v. none\n\u00bc 1\u00b772 (95% CI 0\u00b773, 4\u00b704)). There was a suggestion of\nincreasing risk with decreasing dietary methyl content,\nalthough the risk estimates were not statistically significant.\nThere were no associations between total vitamin B12 or vita-\nmin B6 intakes and colorectal cancer.\nResults of analyses restricted to dietary intake of folate,\nvitamin B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin were similar to those\nfor total intake, with slightly attenuated risk estimates (data\nnot shown).\nThere was no evidence of interactions between total\nfolate intake and total intake of vitamin B12, vitamin B6 or\nriboflavin, nor did particular combinations of alcohol and\ntotal folate influence risk (data not shown). Results were\nunchanged when analyses were repeated for dietary intake\n(data not shown).\nThe C677T genotype distribution among controls con-\nformed with Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (x21 \u00bc 0\u00b700;\nP\u00bc0\u00b7999), but the A1298C distribution did not (x21 \u00bc 6\u00b725;\nP,0\u00b705); there was an excess of homozygous subjects (AA\nand CC) and a deficit of heterozygotes. For C677T, risk\ndecreased with increasing number of variant alleles (multivari-\nate OR for CT v. CC \u00bc 0\u00b777 (95% CI 0\u00b752, 1\u00b716); OR for TT\nv. CC \u00bc 0\u00b762 (95% CI 0\u00b731, 1\u00b724)) but not significantly\n(P(linear trend)\u00bc0\u00b7103; Table 3). For A1298C, the risk for\nhomozygous variant subjects was modestly, but not signifi-\ncantly, reduced (OR for CC v. AA \u00bc 0\u00b781 (95% CI 0\u00b745,\n1\u00b749)). As regards compound genotype, no subjects were\nhomozygous for both variants, while four cases (1\u00b77%) and\neleven controls (2\u00b78%) had three variant alleles. Compared\nwith those with no variant alleles, individuals who were\ndouble heterozygous (OR \u00bc 0\u00b785 (95% CI 0\u00b741, 1\u00b775)) or\nhomozygous variant (OR \u00bc 0\u00b771 (95% CI 0\u00b735, 1\u00b745)) had\nslightly reduced risk. Among individuals who were 1298AA,\nmultivariate OR for the C677T genotypes were: 1\u00b700, 0\u00b782\n(95%CI 0\u00b740, 1\u00b767) and 0\u00b777 (95% CI 0\u00b730, 1\u00b793). Multivari-\nate risk estimates for the A1298C genotypes among individ-\nuals who were 677CC were: 1\u00b700, 1\u00b741 (95% CI 0\u00b767, 2\u00b796)\nand 0\u00b775 (95% CI 0\u00b733, 1\u00b773).\nThere was a significant interaction between C677T and total\nfolate (Table 4; P(interaction)\u00bc0\u00b7029). Compared with CC\nindividuals with low (, median) intake, risk was significantly\nreduced in carriers of the variant allele with low intake (OR\n\u00bc 0\u00b747 (95% CI 0\u00b727, 0\u00b783)), with a less pronounced risk\nreduction in those with high intake. A significant interaction\nwas found between total vitamin B6 intake and C677T\n(P(interaction)\u00bc0\u00b7016), which followed a similar pattern to\nthat for total folate. Repeating the analyses for dietary folate\nand vitamin B6 gave less pronounced risk estimates (data\nnot shown).\nThere was a suggestion that C677T modified the associ-\nations between protein and alcohol intakes and colorectal\ncancer, although the tests for interaction were not statistically\nTable 1.

The participation rate was similar to another\nUK study in which contact was made by post30. Other than\nrefusal, the main reasons for non-participation among cases\nwere death (n 37; 8\u00b77% of those eligible) or general prac-\ntitioner refusal (n 15; 3\u00b75%), primarily because subjects\nwere deemed to be too ill to approach. For controls, the gen-\neral practitioner refused permission to approach sixteen indi-\nviduals and a further eight had died (3\u00b76% in total). Eligible\nmale cases were significantly more likely to participate than\nfemales; controls resident in urban areas were significantly\nless likely to take part31. Deprivation category of residence\nwas not significantly associated with participation among\neither cases or controls. Analysis of known colorectal cancer\nrisk factors resulted in associations consistent with previous\nevidence32.\nOf the controls, 12% were 677TT homozygotes, consistent\nwith the frequency in other white and northern European\npopulations33. Of the controls, 15% carried the 1298 CC\ngenotype, slightly higher than the prevalence in most Euro-\npean studies5, but consistent with another study in the\nsame area (18% CC)34. The A1298C genotype frequencies\nwere not in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium. Since subjects\nwere unaware of the study hypotheses or their genotype,\ndifferential participation by genotype seems unlikely. More-\nover, the genotyping followed rigorous quality-control\nmeasures, which should help guard against systematic\nerrors35. Other potential explanations for a departure from\nHardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium include non-random mating,\ngenetic drift and chance.\nThe FFQ was developed and extensively validated in the\nlocal area. For folate, alcohol and riboflavin, high levels of\nagreement (rank correlation coefficients 0\u00b755\u20130\u00b779) were\nfound when comparing questionnaire responses with 4 d\nweighed records23.\nThe case\u2013control design is potentially susceptible to the\neffects of recall bias in the assessment of lifestyle (but not\nTable 3.

Other than this, the main limitation was\nlimited power both for main effects and, in particular, for\ninteractions. As regards main effects, for a genetic variant\noccurring in 12% of the population (i.e. MTHFR TT) the\nstudy had 80% power to detect an OR of 0\u00b745 or less\n(a \u00bc 0\u00b705; two-sided test); this OR is in the region of the\nrisk estimates reported in previous studies36. It should be\nborne in mind that a relatively large number of statistical\ntests were conducted, and a proportion of positive results\nwould be expected by chance.\nEthnic group was not assessed, but only 3% of subjects\nwere born outside the UK or Ireland (78% born in Scotland;\n17% elsewhere in the UK or Ireland). In the 2001 census\nfor Scotland, 98% of the population described themselves as\n\u2018white\u2019 (Scottish, British, Irish or other) and 2% as south-\neast Asian, Chinese or black37. Thus it seems unlikely that\nthe results were adversely affected by population stratification,\nwhich needs to be quite extreme to have a major impact38.\nFolate and other intake variables\nUnlike most previous studies3, we did not find an inverse\nrelationship between total folate intake and colorectal\ncancer. In contrast, compared with the lowest intake quartile,\nrisk estimates for the other quartiles exceeded unity, and\nfollowed a bell-shaped pattern. A similar pattern has been\nreported between plasma folate and colorectal cancer in a pro-\nspective study from Sweden39. When our analysis was\nrestricted to subjects who did not use folic acid-containing\nsupplements, the pattern persisted (multivariate OR: 1\u00b70,\n1\u00b786 (95% CI 1\u00b707, 3\u00b722), 1\u00b782 (95% CI 1\u00b703, 3\u00b719) and\n0\u00b796 (95% CI 0\u00b751, 1\u00b779)). Although some previous studies\nhave found the inverse relationship to be stronger for colon\nthan rectal tumours40,41, when we stratified by site, there\nwas no clear evidence of a trend with colon or rectal cancer.\nAlthough there may be substantial error in assessment of diet-\nary folate intakes42 and supplement use43, the resulting mis-\nclassification is most probably random, and would be\nunlikely to produce the observed result.\nIn further analyses, in women we found a modest, albeit\nnon-significant, reduced risk in the highest total folate group\n(age- and sex-adjusted OR for quartile 4 v. quartile 1 \u00bc 0\u00b773\n(95% CI 0\u00b735, 1\u00b752)). Several other case\u2013control studies\nfound that the association between colorectal neoplasia and\nfolate (as intake or from supplements) was only evident, or\nwas stronger, amongst females44\u201348. Folic acid supplement\nuse is reported to be higher in women49. In the present\nstudy, 11\u00b76% of females and 7\u00b76% of males used folic acid-\ncontaining supplements.

There may\nalso be a differential effect by sex on folate status of other fac-\ntors influencing dietary methyl content. For example, men are\nmore likely to drink alcohol, and to consume greater quan-\ntities, than women48; in the present study, 74% of females\nand 86% of males consumed alcohol. Similarly, methionine\nintake can be very different, possibly because men are likely\nto eat greater quantities of red meat50. Alternatively, folate\nintake estimates among women may be subject to less\nmeasurement error. In the validation of the FFQ used in the\npresent study, for most nutrients the agreement between ques-\ntionnaire estimates and weighed records was higher for\nfemales than males23.\nThe median dietary folate intake among controls (295mg\/d)\nwas close to population estimates (average intake from food\nand drink 274mg\/d51). In the USA, by contrast, a large pro-\nportion of the population meets the recommended intake of\n400mg\/d52. The proportion of controls taking folic acid-con-\ntaining supplements (, 10%) is typical of the UK popu-\nlation53, but considerably lower than in the USA48,49,54. The\nrange of total intake in the present study was relatively\nnarrow; cut-off points for the lowest and highest quartiles\nwere 264 and 349mg\/d. This contrasts with several previous\nstudies in which the cut-off point for the highest quantile\nwas . 600mg\/d50,55\u201357. Moreover, in most previous studies,\nincluding those where average intake was lower than in the\nUSA58,59, there was greater variability in intake than in the\npresent study. It is noteworthy that in the prospective study\nin Sweden which reported a bell-shaped relationship between\nplasma folate and colorectal cancer39 \u2013 similar to our finding\nfor folate intake \u2013 the plasma folate concentrations were con-\nsiderably lower than in prospective studies from the USA that\nfound inverse relationships with plasma or serum folate36,56.\nVan Guelpen et al. concluded that the low folate status of\ntheir study population may have precluded detection of a pro-\ntective effect of high plasma folate concentrations39. A similar\nconclusion holds for the present study (i.e. the generally low\nintake, and narrow range, meant that a protective effect of\nhigher intakes could not be found). Further, in view of the\nweight of evidence in this area, it seems most likely that the\nincreased risk observed for intermediate intakes is due to\nchance.\nThe lack of statistical interaction between folate and alcohol\nis compatible with most previous studies57\u201360.

There is tension in the previous\nevidence, however, in that the pattern of the folate\u2013methion-\nine interaction is not consistent with what would be expected\non the basis of the low-methyl diet hypothesis: according to\nthis, the combination of low intakes of folate and methionine\ntogether with high alcohol should increase disease risk. The\nmodest raised risk we observed for intermediate and low diet-\nary methyl content is broadly consistent with previous\nstudies48,50,58,60. The extent to which the effect of the\n\u2018methyl diet\u2019 on disease risk exceeds that of folate alone\nremains unclear, however.\nEffects of genotype\nIn most previous studies, carriers of three variant alleles, if they\nhave occurred at all, have been rare5. Our frequencies of 2\u00b78%\namong controls and 1\u00b77% among cases are quite high but are,\nof course, based on very small numbers of individuals. The\nhigh frequency, which appears to occur mainly in UK and\nCanadian populations, may be due to a founder effect61.\nThe moderate risk reduction, and dose\u2013response, associated\nwith the 677T allele, although not statistically significant, is\ncompatible with most previous studies5,14. As regards\nA1298C, eight of eleven studies found lower risk for the\nvariant allele15, although not all reached significance and an\neffect was not seen in all subgroups. Our modest, non-signifi-\ncant, reduced risk in CC subjects is consistent with this.\nIn common with previous investigators36,62,63, we found a\nsignificant interaction between folate and C677T. However,\nthe pattern of interaction differed from that reported pre-\nviously due, in part, to differences in the folate main effect.\nIn addition, for reasons of statistical power, we combined\nCT and TT genotypes in the analysis. This would have con-\ncealed the low risk in TT subjects with high folate (or dietary\nmethyl content) that has been reported elsewhere36,62,64.\nAlthough we observed a significant folate\u2013A1298C inter-\naction, previous studies have been inconsistent54,63,65. There\nis linkage disequilibrium between C677T and A1298C. In the\npresent study, sixty of the sixty-eight individuals with the\n677TT genotype also carried 1298AA, while seventy-nine of\nthe eighty-seven who were 1298CC also carried 677CC.\nThis meant that there was considerable overlap between the\nsub-groups at lowest risk in the two interaction analyses\n(C677T: low folate and CT\/TT genotype; A1298C: low\nfolate and AA genotype), which explains, in part, the different\npatterns of interaction observed for the two polymorphisms.\nMore generally, differences in patterns of linkage disequili-\nbrium between populations may contribute to heterogeneity\nbetween studies66.\nThe less consistent findings for A1298C, than C677T,\nregarding colorectal cancer could also be because A1298C\nappears to have less strong functional effects, although it\nshould be noted that the functional evidence is limited and\nthe in vitro and in vivo impact of the variant allele is not\nfully resolved5,11. In analyses of 199 controls from the present\nstudy, plasma and erythrocyte folate (measured by the micro-\nbiological assay) levels were significantly lower, and plasma\nhomocysteine levels significantly higher, in 677TT than CC\nindividuals, while the A1298C variant was not associated\nwith folate or homocysteine levels67. Neither polymorphism\nwas related to levels of various biomarkers of DNA stability\nmeasured in lymphocytes, including strand breaks, misincor-\nporated uracil or global methylation. The evidence from\nother similar studies on MTHFR and DNA stability is incon-\nsistent68\u201372. One reason for this may be that these studies,\nand those of intake, are not assessing folate status in the rel-\nevant tissue. What may be important is localised (rather than\nsystemic) folate depletion acting in concert with C677T11.\nCurrent knowledge on folate status in colonic tissue is limited.\nFor example, the extent to which colonic folate concentrations\nvary between individuals, or along the colon within a single\nindividual, or correlate with levels in lymphocytes or dietary\nintakes, is not clear.\nThe significant interactions between vitamin B6 and\nMTHFR genotype followed a similar pattern and had risk esti-\nmates similar to those for folate. This may reflect the fact that\ndietary sources for the two nutrients overlap substantially;\nafter adjusting for total energy intake the correlation between\nfolate and vitamin B6 exceeded 0\u00b770.\nSome investigators have reported an alcohol\u2013C677T inter-\naction, such that higher alcohol intake abolished the reduced\ndisease risk associated with the TT genotype36,54,62. The pre-\nsent results suggested effect modification, but were not signifi-\ncant. The median alcohol intake among consumers was lower\nthan the \u2018high\u2019 intake groups in previous studies (present\nstudy, 3\u00b79 g\/d (about 0\u00b75 units\/d); Chen et al.62, $ five\ndrinks\/week; Ma et al.36, $ one drink\/d).\nMost previous studies of folate and folate\u2013MTHFR inter-\nactions have been conducted in populations where intake is\nrelatively high, and a substantial proportion comes in the\nform of folic acid. The results of the present study, undertaken\nin a population with relatively low folate intake, suggest that\nthe role of folate metabolism in colorectal cancer aetiology\nmay be even more complex than previously thought.\nThe challenge now is to unravel this complexity. 5,10-\nMTHFR irreversibly converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate\nto 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, the former vital for DNA syn-\nthesis and the latter key in DNA methylation. Thus, the\nC677T polymorphism alters the distribution of erythrocyte\nfolates73, suggesting that particular folate species might\nbe important in colorectal cancer. The direction of the\nMTHFR\u2013colorectal cancer association \u2013 which is the oppo-\nsite of that expected a priori5 \u2013 suggests that the availability\nof tetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate may\nbe particularly pertinent. This is supported by a study in color-\nectal tumour tissue, which found that 677TT patients had\nsignificantly lower concentrations of tetrahydrofolate and\n5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate74. Expansion of the evidence\non individual folate species with regard to: (1) distribution\nin the diet, blood and other bodily tissues in different popu-\nlations; (2) factors that influence intracellular distribution\nand availability; and (3) disease risk, might help advance\nunderstanding of folate metabolism in colorectal neoplasia\nand, ultimately, shed light on carcinogenesis pathways.\nAcknowledgements\nThe present study was funded by a grant from the National\nHospitals Trust.
