Most of the reports have used rf sputtering of\nGa or GaN targets in an N2 or N2\/Ar atmosphere.1\u20136 Sput-\ntering is attractive because of its convenience and low cost.\nSeveral reports have indicated that the incorporation of hy-\ndrogen during GaN growth is highly desirable.7\u20139 Hydrogen\nis thought to passivate dangling bonds, dislocations, and de-\nfects in amorphous and polycrystalline materials, just as it\ndoes in a-Si:H. Hydrogenation of GaN during growth by\nremote-plasma metal-organic chemical-vapor deposition at\n380 \u00b0C has made it possible to fabricate visible-blind\nphotodiodes10 and light-emitting devices.11 The addition of\nH2 during the growth of both single-crystal9 and disordered\nmaterials8 has been observed to increase the intensity of the\nphotoluminescence \u0001PL\u0002 significantly. In the latter case, the\nmaterial was grown in a similar manner to that reported here,\nbut using magnetron sputtering and no Ar, and the optical\nproperties were examined. This paper discusses the changes\nin the optical and electrical properties with hydrogenation.\nGaN films were deposited using a Nordiko, 13.56 MHz\nconventional rf sputtering system. The Ga target is contained\nin a Ni dish on the lower driven electrode, and substrates are\nattached to the upperearthed electrode. Ar, N2, and H2 are fed\ninto the chamber via mass-flow controllers. A quartz shield\nsurrounds the area between the two electrodes to confine the\nplasma. Both electrodes are water cooled, keeping the sub-\nstrate temperature near room temperature. Prior to each\ndeposition, the chamber and gas lines are evacuated to below\n3\u000110\u22124 Pa. The N2 and Ar flow rates were 8 and 12 SCCM\n\u0001standard cubic centimeter per minute\u0002, respectively. The tar-\nget bias was \u2212800 V and the pressure was 2.0 Pa. The H2\nflow rate was varied in the range of 0\u20135 SCCM, and the film\nthickness was kept close to 100 nm.\nEllipsometry at 632.8 nm was used to measure the film\nthickness and refractive index.

The\nsurface topography was analyzed using a Digital Instru-\nments, Dimension 3100 atomic force microscope \u0001AFM\u0002 op-\nerating in tapping mode. The relative elemental composition\nof the films was measured using energy-dispersive x-ray\n\u0001EDX\u0002 spectroscopy in a Philips XL30 SEM. The optical-\nabsorption spectra of samples on quartz substrates were mea-\nsured with a Camspec M300 UV-visible spectrophotometer.\nThe absorption spectra of the films were obtained by sub-\ntracting the substrate absorbance from the total absorbance.\nOptical band gaps were estimated by extrapolating linear fits\nto plots of the absorption coefficient \u0002 squared versus the\nphoton energy h\u0003 at the band edge. A Nicolet Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 460\nFourier transform spectrometer was used to obtain infrared\n\u0001IR\u0002 transmission spectra from the films on Si. PL spectra\nwere obtained at room temperature using a Renishaw micro-\nRaman system and a 325 nm excitation. I-V measurements\nwere performed on metal-semiconductor-metal \u0001MSM\u0002\nstructures, and differential resistivity values were calculated\nfrom fits to the data at \u00b10.5 V. The structures were fabricated\nby evaporating 0.35-mm-diam Al pads onto the films on Cr-\non-glass substrates.\nA selection of the IR spectra of films deposited at differ-\nent H2 concentrations is plotted in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002. As the H2 flow\nrate is increased, a broad peak emerges at around 3205 cm\u22121\nand increases monotonically with H2 concentration. This is\nthought to be the N\u2013H stretching mode which has been re-\nported at 3200 cm\u221217. There is also a very small peak at\naround 2100 cm\u22121 which reaches a maximum at 4.8% H2\nand has previously been attributed to the Ga\u2013H stretching\nmode.7 Thus, as expected, the degree of hydrogenation in-\ncreases with H2 flow rate.\nIn Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002, the oxygen content increases rapidly with\nH2 concentration, from 3 at. % at 0% H2 to 21 at. % at 7%\nH2. Thereafter, it decreases slightly to around 18 at. % at\n20% H2. Since there is no obvious change in the deposition\nrate, two possible reasons are considered. One possibility is\nthat the hydrogen supply was contaminated with O2 or H2O.\nHowever, this is unlikely because the purity was 99.9995%,\nand this would not explain the levelling off at higher H2 flow\n\u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics8-1\no AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\n036108-2 Knox-Davies et al. J. Appl. Phys. 99, 036108 \u00022006\u0001rates. The H2 may also increase the amount of O adsorbed\nonto the growth surface. However, significant O contamina-\ntion is not uncommon for sputtered GaN.12\u201314\nThe PL spectra of the 100 nm films are plotted in Fig.\n2\u0001a\u0002. The 0% H2 sample exhibits essentially no PL, but a\nbroad peak centered at around 2.1\u20132.2 eV emerges and in-\ncreases in amplitude with increased H2 flow. There is also a\nsmall peak at 3.3 eV, possibly corresponding to band-to-\nband transitions, although this could be the overtone of the\nRaman scattering from the hydrogen stretch mode. The sharp\npeaks at higher energies are the GaN A1 \u0001LO\u0002 Raman peak\nand its harmonics. The PL spectra of the 1 \u0004m samples are\nshown in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002. In the range of 1.95\u20132.30 eV, the hydro-\ngenated sample exhibits luminescence in a broad band, con-\nsisting of two overlapping peaks centered at 1.99 and\n2.13 eV. The trends in the PL intensity are different from\nthose observed by Miyazaki et al.8 There, PL was only ob-\nserved below 100 K without hydrogenation and in a broad\nband at 1.9\u20133.3 eV. Hydrogenation gave rise to a single\nroom-temperature luminescence peak at 3.25 eV.Figure 2\u0001c\u0002\nshows a plot of the width of the A1 \u0001LO\u0002 Raman peak as a\nfunction of the hydrogen concentration in the deposition at-\nmosphere. The observed increase in the peak width, as the\nhydrogen concentration is raised, is indicative of a decrease\nin the long-range order of the films, most likely due to aDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tdecrease in the grain size. Despite the apparent increase in\nstructural disorder \u0001discussed more fully later\u0002, the hydrogen\nmay terminate dangling bonds and thus reduce the concen-\ntration of sites where nonradiative recombination can take\nplace, improving the PL, albeit in the yellow-band region.\nYellow luminescence is regularly observed for undoped or\nn-type GaN at around 2.2 eV and has been attributed to the\nradiative recombination of donor-acceptor pairs created by\npoint or extended crystalline defects.15,16\nAs the deposition H2 fraction increases from 0% to 20%,\nthe refractive index decreases from 2.45 to 1.98, and the\nband gap increases from 3.06 to 3.64 eV, these are thought\nmainly to reflect the increase in the films\u2019 oxygen content.\nThis is because the changes have been found to be correlated\nwith O contamination for other nonhydrogenated films.\nIn Fig. 3, the trends in the resistivity data are very dif-\nferent from those of the other parameters. There is an initial\nrapid decrease from around 2\u0001108 \u0005 cm at 0% H2 to a\nminimum of 2\u0001106 \u0005 cm at 2.4% H2. Thereafter, it in-\ncreases again, rapidly at first, reaching 8\u00011011 \u0005 cm at 20%\nH2. This could be due to the hydrogen initially passivating\ndefects in the intergranular regions, easing the passage of\ncurrent between crystallites. Passivation of defect states at\nthe Cr\u2013GaN interface could account for the emergence of\nthe Schottky barrier17 which is visible as a difference in the\nFIG. 1.

Beyond this point, increased\npassivation of defects may reduce the traps necessary for\nPoole-Frenkel conduction \u0001which takes place for 0% H2, ac-\ncording to the I-V characteristics\u0002. The Schottky barrier may\nthen cease to be visible because the high resistivity makes\nthe dominant conduction mechanism bulk limited. Alterna-\ntively, the minimum in the resistivity could indicate a region\nin which crystallites reach the back contact rather than form\nafter an initial amorphous region. However, AFM and SEM\nimages appear to show reduced crystallinity with H2 flow.\nThe widths of the GaN A1 \u0001LO\u0002 Raman peaks also increase\nmonotonically with H2 flow rate \u0001from 33.0 cm\u22121 at 0% H2\nto 37.6 cm\u22121 at 20% H2\u0002, indicative of an increased structural\ndisorder. This may also contribute towards the resistivity in-\ncrease.\nFigure 4 shows AFM phase and SEM images of the sur-\nfaces of 1 \u0004m films deposited at 0% and 2.4% H2. In the\nhydrogenated film, particles appear as loose clumps rather\nthan as well-defined grains, and the AFM phase image ap-\npears to show large numbers of crystallites within each\nclump. It is as though there has been repeated nucleations\nduring the growth process. This would be consistent with a\nfilm which does not become more ordered with film thick-\nness, rather than with the type observed without H2, where\ncolumnar crystallites increase in size with film thickness.\nMiyazaki et al. observed that films sputtered with H2 become\namorphouslike.8 The surfaces of the 100 nm films become\nincreasingly rough with H2 flow, but there is nothing obvious\nto explain the resistivity minimum at 2.4% H2.\nIn conclusion, hydrogenation of the film by the addition\nof H2 during growth increases the PL from essentially zero to\na weak but clear signal, albeit in the yellow-band region.\nThis occurs together with an apparent increase in the degree\nof structural disorder. The resistivity reaches a minimum at\nFIG. 3. Differential resistivity as a function of the hydrogen concentration in\nthe deposition atmosphere.2.4% H2.
