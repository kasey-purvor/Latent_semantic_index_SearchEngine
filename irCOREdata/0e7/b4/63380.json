However, over the past\ndecade there has been a growing appreciation of the\nimportance of indirect effects of above- and below-\nground herbivory on plant communities, via their\ninfluence on soil biological properties and processes\n(Bardgett, Wardle & Yeates 1998; Bardgett & Wardle\n2003; Wardle \n \net al\n \n. 2004; Bardgett \n \net al\n \n. 2005). In par-\nticular, it has become apparent that plant physiological\nresponses to both foliar and root herbivory that alter\nrates of root exudation can influence the activity of\n \n\u2020Author to whom correspondence should be addressed\n(present address: Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory,\nColorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1499,\nUSA).

Such responses of plants to herbivory\ntherefore have the potential to alter nutrient availability\nand acquisition by plants, thereby influencing local-\nscale plant\u2013plant interactions.\nTo date, most studies investigating the relationship\nbetween herbivory and plant inputs below ground\nhave focused on carbon rhizodeposition. For instance,\nat the individual plant level, defoliation of a range of\nplants has been shown to increase the exudation of\nisotopically labelled C from roots into the soil (Holland,\nChang & Crossley 1996; Hamilton & Frank 2001;\nPaterson \n \net al\n \n. 2003, 2005; Murray \n \net al\n \n. 2004; but\ncf. Todorovic \n \net al\n \n. 1999; Mikola & Kyt\u00f6viita 2002;\nDilkes, Jones & Farrar 2004), which can stimulate\nmicrobial activity in the root zone (Mawdsley & Bard-\ngett 1997; Guitian & Bardgett 2000) and increase soil\nnitrogen availability and its uptake by defoliated plants\n(Hamilton & Frank 2001; Ayres \n \net al\n \n. 2004). Similarly,\nbelow-ground herbivory of clover has been shown to\nenhance transfer of C from plant roots to the rhizo-\nsphere, resulting in a stimulation of  soil microbial\nbiomass (Yeates \n \net al\n \n. 1998, 1999; Bardgett, Denton &\nCook 1999; Denton \n \net al\n \n. 1999). These studies point\nto an indirect and short-term pathway whereby both\nabove- and below-ground herbivory can enhance soil N\navailability to plants, via increased C rhizodeposition,\nleading to a stimulation of  microbial populations\nand enhanced rates of N mineralization. However, few\nstudies have investigated the direct effect of herbivory\non the rhizodeposition of N from plants, which may\nalso enhance N availability in the soil. For instance,\nbelow-ground herbivory of clover by root-feeding\nnematodes has been shown to increase the exudation\nof  N into the soil, resulting in increased transfer of\nclover-derived N to a neighbouring grass species,\nstimulating its growth (Bardgett \n \net al\n \n. 1999; Dromph\n \net al\n \n. 2006). The effect of above-ground herbivory, and\ncombined effects of root and foliar herbivory, on\nshort-term N rhizodeposition and below-ground N\ntransfer have not been investigated.\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of both\ndefoliation through clipping and root herbivory on\nthe transfer of  N from a legume (\n \nTrifolium repens\n \n)\nto a neighbouring grass (\n \nLolium perenne\n \n). We also\nmeasured the growth response of each plant species to\ndefoliation and root herbivory of \n \nT. repens\n \n, and effects\non the soil microbial biomass. \n \nTrifolium repens\n \n is the\nmost abundant legume in European and New Zealand\ngrasslands, and often co-occurs with grass species,\nincluding \n \nL. perenne\n \n (Whitehead 1995). Moreover,\n \nT. repens\n \n is frequently subject to both defoliation (by\nlivestock and other herbivores, as well as cutting) and\nroot herbivory (Cook \n \net al\n \n. 1992; Whitehead 1995). In\naddition, up to 80% of grass N may be derived from\nclover (Broadbent, Nakashima & Chang 1982; Boller\n& N\u00f6sberger 1987; Ledgard 1991). In this study, we\nexperimentally controlled root herbivory by inoculat-\ning microcosms with \n \nHeterodera trifolii\n \n, a widespread\nobligate root-feeding nematode that parasitizes \n \nT.\nrepens\n \n throughout the UK and New Zealand, and is\nassociated with reduced \n \nT. repens\n \n biomass (Skipp &\nChristensen 1983; Cook & York 1985; Cook \n \net al\n \n. 1992).\nWe tested the hypothesis that both above-ground\nclipping and below-ground herbivory would increase\nthe transfer of  \n \nT. repens\n \n-derived N to neighbouring\n \nL. perenne\n \n plants, thereby benefiting its growth. We\npredicted that the transfer of \n \nT. repens\n \n-derived N to\nneighbouring plants would be greatest when defoliation\nand root herbivory operate together. These hypotheses\nwere tested in model \n \nT. repens\u2013L. perenne\n \n systems,\nusing \n \nT. repens\n \n plants whose foliage was labelled with\n \n15\n \nN to enable measurement of N transfer.\n \nMaterials and methods\n \nA brown earth soil was collected from an unfertilized\nhay meadow at Colt Park, Ingleborough National\nNature Reserve, north-west England (54\n \n\u00b0\n \n12\n \n\u2032\n \n N, 2\n \n\u00b0\n \n21\n \n\u2032\n \nW). Colt Park meadow is an \n \nL. perenne\u2013Cynosurus\ncristatus\n \n grassland on a soil of moderate\u2013high residual\nfertility (Smith \n \net al\n \n. 2003). The soil was passed through\na 6-mm sieve and then defaunated by three freezing\n(\n \n\u2212\n \n20 \n \n\u00b0\n \nC) and heating (50 \n \n\u00b0\n \nC) cycles. Several other\nstudies have employed a similar method to defaunate\nsoil (Laakso & Set\u00e4l\u00e4 1999a, 1999b; Liiri \n \net al\n \n. 2002).\nAlthough this defaunation procedure results in the\ndeath of some microbes and may alter their community\ncomposition, a soil microbial community remains\n(Laakso & Set\u00e4l\u00e4 1999a). Defaunated soil was added\nto 40 0\u00b775-l pots (10 cm diameter) into which two \n \nT.\nrepens\n \n cuttings and two \n \nL. perenne\n \n tillers were planted.\nThe plants were placed in a growth chamber main-\ntained at 15 \n \n\u00b0\n \nC with 16\/8 h light\/dark cycles.\nThe treatments (\n \n\u00b1\n \n H. trifolii\n \n, \n \n\u00b1\n \n clipping and \n \n\u00b1\n \n labelling\nwith \n \n15\n \nN) were applied in a fully factorial randomized\nblock design with five replicate blocks. Treatments\nwere not replicated within each block. After 90 days,\nhalf the pots were inoculated with \n \nH. trifolii\n \n (an obligate\nroot-feeding nematode of \n \nT. repens\n \n that does not attack\n \nL. perenne\n \n) by adding a suspension of \n \n\u2248\n \n1000 infective\njuveniles to the soil. The \n \nH. trifolii\n \n inoculum was\nprepared from full cysts extracted from pots of sandy\nsoil planted with \n \nT. repens\n \n. Clean cysts were placed on\nsieves standing in shallow trays filled with water, and\ninfective juveniles emerging from eggs within these\ncysts were collected daily and stored at 2 \n \n\u00b0\n \nC. Suspen-\nsions of  juveniles were bulked and concentrated by\nsettling and decanting at 2 \n \n\u00b0\n \nC, and aliquots taken from\nthe suspension were pipetted into soil around the\n \nT. repens\n \n plants. The clipping treatment of  \n \nT. repens\n \n(removal of \n \n\u2248\n \n50% of leaves) was applied on two occasions\n(days 174 and 186); \n \nL. perenne\n \n plants were not clipped.\nRemoval of 50% leaf area was considered appropriate\nas it is similar to defoliation of  clover-dominated\npasture (Orr \n \net al\n \n. 2004). The short time between\n 258\n \nE.

In contrast,\n \nH. trifolii\n \n needed time to colonize the roots of \n \nT. repens\n \nafter inoculation. Half  the pots were labelled with \n \n15\n \nN\nfor 7 days starting on day 188; the remaining unlabelled\npots were used to determine the natural abundance\nof  \n \n15\n \nN stable isotopes and were not included in the\nstatistical analysis of any measure. Labelling with \n \n15\n \nN\nconsisted of immersing three trifoliate leaves of each \n \nT.\nrepens\n \n plant into a 10 at % \n \n15\n \nN-labelled 300-m\n \nm\n \n KNO\n \n3\n \nsolution for 7 days immediately before the end of the\nexperiment (Bardgett \n \net al\n \n. 1999).\nThe pots were destructively harvested 195 days after\nestablishment, immediately after labelling with \n \n15\n \nN.\nRoots from each species were carefully separated from\nthe soil. Nodules were clearly visible on clover roots,\nindicating that they had successfully formed an asso-\nciation with \n \nRhizobium\n \n. Shoot and root biomass for\neach species was determined by drying and weighing\nplant material (70 \n \n\u00b0\n \nC). A subsample of shoot and root\nmaterial was ground for stable isotope analysis, which\nwas conducted on a Carlo Erba elemental analyser\n(CE Elantech, Lakewood, USA) coupled to a isotope\nratio mass spectrometer (Denis Leigh Technologies,\nManchester, UK). Separate clover and grass-root\nsubsamples, taken from block 1 pots only, were analysed\nfor root infestation by \n \nH. trifolii\n \n: only a single measure-\nment of  clover and grass-root infestation was made\nfor each treatment. Roots were cleared, mixed with\ndistilled water (25 ml) and acid fuchsin stain solution\n(1 ml), and boiled for 30 s (Byrd, Kirkpatrick & Barker\n1983), then stained nematodes within the roots were\ncounted using a stereomicroscope. In addition, \n \nH.\ntrifolii\n \n cysts were extracted from 100 g (FW) soil from\neach microcosm by elutriation for 90 s at 4\u00b75 l min\n \n\u2212\n \n1\n \n,\ncollected from the floated debris by hand under a\nstereomicroscope, and counted. Soil microbial biomass\nC and N were determined using the fumigation\u2013extraction\nprocedure (Brookes \n \net al\n \n. 1985; Vance, Brookes &\nJenkinson 1987).\nThe concentration of \n \n15\n \nN in plant tissues was calcu-\nlated using the following equation:\n \n15\n \nN\n \nconc\n \n \n \n=\n \n N\n \nconc\n \n \n \n\u00d7\n \n (\n \n15\n \nN\n \nat%\n \n\/100) eqn 1\nwhere \n \n15\n \nN\n \nconc\n \n is the concentration of \n \n15\n \nN in the plant\ntissue, Nconc is the concentration of  N in the plant\ntissue, and 15Nat% is the percentage of N atoms in the\nplant tissue that are 15N rather than 14N. The natural\nabundance of 15N in unlabelled plants was averaged\nacross the five replicates of each treatment combination,\nand this value was subtracted from the 15N concentra-\ntion of each of the labelled plants subjected to that\ntreatment, to determine excess 15N concentrations.\nData were analysed using generalized linear models\n(Nelder & Wedderburn 1972) with the GENMOD pro-\ncedure in sas ver. 8\u00b70 (SAS Institute 1990). Defoliation,\nH. trifolii and block were independent variables in each\nanalysis, and T. repens root excess 15N concentration\nwas used as a covariate for analysis of  grass excess\n15N data, as 15N transfer to L. perenne was expected to\nrelate to the concentration of 15N in T. repens roots\n(Bardgett et al. 1999; Dromph et al. 2006). Heterodera\ntrifolii inoculation was not included as an independent\nvariable for the analysis of H. trifolii cyst abundance in\nsoil, as only a single cyst was found in the uninoculated\npots. The number of  H. trifolii cysts in the soil, T.\nrepens and L. perenne shoot and root biomass, and\nmicrobial biomass C and N were log-transformed to\nmeet assumptions of normality and homogeneity of\nvariance. Statistical significance was taken as P < 0\u00b705.\nResults\nInoculation of T. repens with the root-feeding nema-\ntode was successful, resulting in an average of 917 cysts\nper kg soil in the H. trifolii treatments; only a single\ncyst was found in one sample of the uninoculated soil,\nconfirming that the initial defaunation procedure had\nbeen successful. Defoliation did not significantly affect\ncyst abundance in the inoculated soil; mean \u00b1 SE\nnumber of cysts per kg dry soil were 587 \u00b1 237 in the\nunclipped treatment and 1248 \u00b1 415 in the clipped\ntreatment (F1,4 = 0\u00b71, P > 0\u00b71). Consistent with the soil\ndata, no H. trifolii were observed in T. repens roots\nfrom uninoculated pots, whereas 1318 H. trifolii per g\nroot were observed in roots of undefoliated T. repens,\nand 411 H. trifolii per g root were observed in roots of\ndefoliated T. repens. This level of infection is equiva-\nlent to 66 nematodes per plant in the undefoliated\ntreatment and 21 nematodes per plant in the defoliated\ntreatment; around 25 nematodes per plant is typical of\nlightly infested grass\u2013clover pastures in the UK (Cook\net al. 1992). No H. trifolii were observed in L. perenne\nroots from any of the treatments.\nNeither defoliation nor infection with H. trifolii\naffected T. repens shoot biomass at the end of  the\nexperiment (Fig. 1a). However, defoliation doubled\nT. repens total shoot biomass production, when cal-\nculated as the biomass of  accumulated clippings\ntaken from the two defoliation events and shoot mass\nat the end of  the experiment (F1,4 = 43\u00b79, P = 0\u00b7003;\nFig. 1b), indicating that T. repens compensated for\nthe tissue lost as a result of  defoliation. Defoliation\nalso increased T. repens root biomass by 34% at the\nend of  the experiment (F1,4 = 5\u00b71, P = 0\u00b7024; Fig. 1c).\nLabelling of  T. repens with 15N was successful: clover-\nroot excess 15N values were 3\u00b79 \u00b5g per g root when\naveraged across all treatments (Fig. 1d). The allocation\nof  15N to roots of  T. repens was unaffected by any of\nthe treatments.\nDefoliation of T. repens significantly increased the\nsize of the soil microbial biomass (microbial biomass\nC) by 77% (F1,4 = 15\u00b74, P < 0\u00b7001), but had no effect on\nthe amount of N contained within microbes (microbial\nbiomass N) (Fig. 2).

Defoliation of T. repens resulted in a fivefold\nincrease of  15N recovery in L. perenne roots, while\ninoculation with H. trifolii reduced 15N transfer from\nT. repens to L. perenne by 13%. The concentration of\nT. repens-derived 15N in grass shoots was not affected\nby the treatments (Fig. 3b), and neither treatment\naltered L. perenne root or shoot biomass at the end of\nthe experiment (Fig. 4).\nDiscussion\nThe aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that\nboth defoliation and root herbivory of clover (T.\nrepens) stimulates soil microbial biomass and the flux\nof T. repens-derived N to neighbouring plants. This was\nachieved by measuring the effect of defoliation and\nroot herbivory on the soil microbial biomass and the\ntransfer of T. repens-derived 15N to the neighbouring\nFig. 3.

Defoliation resulted in a fivefold\nincrease in concentrations of 15N in L. perenne roots,\nindicating increased transfer of N from T. repens. The\nconcentration of 15N in L. perenne shoots was also\ngreater in the defoliated treatment; however, this in-\ncrease was not significant, possibly because the shoots\nare an extra \u2018step\u2019 removed from the source of 15N.\nAlthough we cannot be certain of the mechanism\nbehind the increase in N transfer from T. repens to\nL. perenne, the short period between 15N labelling of T.\nrepens and 15N sampling of L. perenne suggests a direct\nphysiological mechanism, such as increased exudation\nof N to the soil and\/or transfer of N by mycorrhizae.\nNitrogen transfer from legumes to non-legumes via\nmycorrhizae has been demonstrated in other studies,\nfor example, from Trifolium alexandrinum to Zea mays\n(Frey & Sch\u00fcepp 1992). Regardless of the mechanism,\nthis is the first time, as far as we are aware, that defolia-\ntion has been shown to increase N transfer from one\nplant species to a neighbouring plant species (\u2018direct\npathway\u2019, Fig. 5). Defoliation has been shown to\nstimulate soil N availability through effects on the\nphysiology of trees (Ayres et al. 2004) and a grazing-\ntolerant grass (Hamilton & Frank 2001). However,\nthis was thought to be the result of increased C inputs\nenhancing the mineralization of soil organic N via a\nstimulation of the soil microbial community (\u2018indirect\npathway\u2019, Fig. 5; Hamilton & Frank 2001), rather\nthan increased N inputs into the soil by the defoliated\nplants. The positive effect of defoliation on microbial\nbiomass that we observed indicates that the indirect\npathway may also have operated in this study, although\nwe did not measure N mineralization in the soil. The\nresults presented here, in combination with evidence\nfrom the literature, suggest that defoliation can increase\nN availability via both a direct and indirect pathway\n(Fig. 5). First, defoliated plants can increase N inputs\nbelow-ground, resulting in enhanced transfer to neigh-\nbouring plants (direct pathway). Second, defoliated\nplants often increase soil C inputs, stimulating the\nactivity of the soil microbial community that mediates\nN-mineralization rates (indirect pathway) (Hamilton &\nFrank 2001). Further studies are required to determine\nif  defoliation of  other legumes, and non-leguminous\nspecies, influences N transfer to neighbouring plants.\nInoculation of T. repens with H. trifolii also altered\nN transfer from T. repens to L. perenne, resulting in a\n13% reduction in N transfer when T. repens root excess\n15N concentration was used as a covariate. This is\nsurprising given that two other studies, using a similar\napproach, have shown increased 15N transfer from\nT. repens to L. perenne in response to root feeding by\nnematodes. Bardgett et al. (1999) observed that H. trifolii\nincreased 15N flux from T. repens to L. perenne; and\nDromph et al. (2006) observed a positive relationship\nbetween the density of  two root-feeding nematodes\n(H. trifolii and Pratylenchus sp.) in T. repens roots, and\n15N transfer to, and growth of, L. perenne. The study\nby Bardgett et al. (1999) had a long period between\nlabelling and sampling (84 days), whereas we sampled\nimmediately after labelling with 15N. Thus our con-\ntrasting findings may indicate that increased transfer\nof T. repens-derived N as a result of root herbivory may\nbecome apparent only after several weeks or months.\nDromph et al. (2006) observed increased T. repens-derived\nFig. 4.

In contrast, defoliation of T. repens\nsignificantly increased both total accumulated shoot\nbiomass (100%), indicating compensatory growth, and\nroot biomass (34%), relative to undefoliated plants.\nDenton et al. (1999) found that low-level infestation of\nT. repens with H. trifolii did not affect shoot or root\nbiomass, but high-level infestation reduced shoot\nbiomass (Denton et al. 1999). In contrast, Bardgett\net al. (1999) observed greater clover root biomass in\nthe presence of H. trifolii 84 days after inoculation. It\nhas long been known that defoliation can promote com-\npensatory growth in a range of plants (McNaughton\n1985; Hamilton & Frank 2001; Ayres et al. 2004)\nincluding T. repens (del Val & Crawley 2004). Our\nfindings indicate that moderate rates of  defoliation\ncan promote root and shoot production by T. repens,\nand simultaneously increase N transfer to L. perenne.\nGiven that N-limitation is common in terrestrial\necosystems (Vitousek & Howarth 1991), increased N\nsupply has the potential to influence plant production\nin grassland ecosystems. Several studies have observed\npositive effects of herbivory on plant production in\nnatural ecosystems, which have been attributed to a\nvariety of  mechanisms, such as selective feeding\naltering plant community structure, or stimulation of\nsoil nutrient availability due to the addition of labile\norganic matter in animal waste (McNaughton et al.\n1997a, 1997b; Augustine & McNaughton 1998; Frank\n& Groffman 1998); although negative effects of her-\nbivory on plant productivity are also common (Pastor\net al. 1993; Bardgett & Wardle 2003). Our finding may\nrepresent a previously unrecognized mechanism for\nthe stimulation of primary productivity, which requires\nfurther testing under field conditions.\nThe growth of L. perenne, measured as shoot and\nroot biomass, was not affected by any of the experi-\nmental treatments. This is surprising given the increase\nin N transfer to L. perenne as a result of  defoliation\nand the N-responsive nature of  this species (Daepp,\nN\u00f6sberger & L\u00fcscher 2001; Wagner et al. 2001). How-\never, the lack of response may be due to the relatively\nshort period between the first defoliation event and the\nend of the experiment (3 weeks), and\/or the inherently\nhigh availability of N in the soil due to its moderate\u2013\nhigh fertility and a pretreatment of  sieving and\ndefaunation (several freeze\u2013thaw cycles). Both these\ndisturbances are likely to have resulted in a flush of N\nto the soil which, in combination with the N fixed by\nrhizobia on the roots of T. repens, may have meant that\nL. perenne was not N-limited. Contrary to our findings,\nBardgett et al. (1999) and Dromph et al. (2006) observed\nincreased L. perenne growth when neighbouring T.\nrepens was subjected to root herbivory. In these experi-\nments, increased growth of L. perenne coincided with\nincreased transfer of T. repens-derived N to L. perenne\n(Bardgett et al. 1999; Dromph et al. 2006). Both\nBardgett et al. (1999) and Dromph et al. (2006) used\nsoil of low N status, which might have resulted in N-\nlimitation of L. perenne, and potentially explains why\nL. perenne biomass increased in response to enhanced\nN transfer from T. repens in their studies, but not in\nours.\nAs far as we are aware, this study is the first to inves-\ntigate the effects of both defoliation and below-ground\nherbivory on nutrient fluxes to neighbouring plants.\nThe results show that both types of herbivory may\ninfluence N transfer between plant species. However,\nthey do not support our hypothesis that defoliation\nand below-ground herbivory interact positively to\nincrease N transfer from T. repens to L. perenne. Con-\nsistent with our findings, studies of  plant responses\nto above- and below-ground herbivory often report\nfew interactive effects (M\u00fcller-Sch\u00e4rer & Brown 1995;\nMaron 1998; Rudgers & Hoeksema 2003), despite\nevidence that above- and below-ground herbivores of\nthe same plant can influence each other (Moran &\nWhitham 1990; Masters & Brown 1992; Masters, Brown\n& Gange 1993). The results presented here warrant\nfurther investigation under field conditions and with\nreal above-ground herbivores. However, given the\nprevalence of N-fixing plants in grassland and early\nsuccessional communities (Stevens & Walker 1970;\nWhitehead 1995), foliar herbivory could have impor-\ntant implications for plant community structure and\nsuccession, as increased N transfer from N-fixers to\nneighbouring non-N-fixing species might alter their\ncompetitive interactions.\nAcknowledgements\nTechnical assistance was provided by Helen Quirk,\nKate Harrison and Tony Mizen.
