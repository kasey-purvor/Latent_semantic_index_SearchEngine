While correlational approaches, based in linear algebra, typically use regression to establish the net \neffects of several \u201cindependent\u201d variables on an outcome, the set theoretic approach analyses, more holistically, the \nconjunctions of factors sufficient and\/or necessary for an outcome to occur.

The former genre \u2013 our focus here \n\u2013 addresses correlations between variables and, in regression modelling, the effect of one or more variables on \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n4 \n \n \nsome outcome. Individual cases, the carriers of the variables, usually remain in the background. It is variables \nthat act, by having their effects on a dependent outcome variable. In the typical multivariate study, the purpose \nis to report the net (usually average) effect of each independent variable \u2013 i.e. its effects with other variables \n\u201econtrolled\u201f \u2013 on the chosen outcome variable. The underlying mathematics is matrix algebra and the basic \ntool is a symmetric measure of correlation. A typical paper will contain a table setting out a list of all the \nexamined independent variables and, for each, a coefficient allowing its relative net importance to be \nassessed\n2\n. A typical question examined might be whether either cognitive or social variables, treated as \nindependently contributing factors, explain more of the variance in educational achievement. \nIt is assumed in the default model that these \u201eindependent\u201f variables do indeed act independently of one \nanother. As Ragin (2006a) argues, in this \u201enet effects\u201f approach, \n\u2026 estimates of the effects of independent variables are based on the assumption that each variable, by \nitself, is capable of producing or influencing the level or probability of the outcome.  While it is \ncommon to treat \"causal\" and \"independent\" as synonymous modifiers of the word \"variable,\" the core \nmeaning of \"independent\" is this notion of autonomous capacity.  Specifically, each independent \nvariable is assumed to be capable of influencing the level or probability of the outcome regardless of \nthe values or levels of other variables (i.e., regardless of the varied contexts defined by these variables).  \nEstimates of net effects thus assume additivity, that the net impact of a given independent variable on \nthe outcome is the same across all the values of the other independent variables and their different \ncombinations.  (pp. 14-15) \nSuch causal homogeneity across cases is typically assumed. The effect of, say, measured ability on \neducational achievement is usually reported, net of the effects of competing variables, in terms of a single \ncoefficient applicable to all cases in the sample or, by inference, in the population. It is usually only in \nparticular specialist fields that the possibility of causal heterogeneity is addressed\n3\n. For those who regard \nregression models as more than description, these assumptions \u2013 actually assumptions about the causal \nstructure of the social world \u2013 allow the prediction of an outcome for a new case from the same population to \nbe made simply by adding the effects due to the values of various independent variables for that case.  \nThe regression approach has received considerable critical discussion over a long period, and not only from \nthose \u201equalitative\u201f writers who regard its being \u201epositivist\u201f as an adequate reason to dismiss it. Turner (1948), \nlong ago, raised serious worries about the assumption of \u201ea causally homogeneous universe\u201f and of linearity in \nhis discussion of statistical logic in social science. Meehl (1970) raised major problems about the \nconceptualisation and adequacy of \u201econtrol\u201f variables. There is also interesting relevant discussion in Abell \n(1971). Lieberson (1985), in a book that deserves much greater attention, developed such critical points in a \nnumber of fruitful directions. Freedman (e.g. 1991) focused critical discussion on regression used as a causal \nmodelling procedure. Pawson (1989) offered an incisive critique of the weaknesses of the variable analytic \ntradition. Abbott (2001) unpacked many of the fundamental but often unrealistic assumptions of the linear \nmodelling approach in social science and explored some case-based alternatives. Byrne (e.g. 2002) employed \ncomplexity theory to draw attention to analytic weaknesses that flow from the central assumptions of \nconventional quantitative analysis. \nThe crucial difference between the linear algebraic approach and an alternative that drops the assumption of \n\u201eindependence\u201f is summarised by Mahoney & Goertz (2006) in their discussion of the set theoretic alternative \nto regression and the way in which it addresses causal complexity via the language of necessity and \nsufficiency. Set theoretic (Boolean) equations have a different functional form to the regression equations with \nwhich social scientists are familiar. Here is their illustrative (and deterministic\n4\n) example:   \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n5 \n \n \nY = (A*B*c) + (A*C*D*E)          \nIn these equations the symbol * indicates Logical AND (set intersection), + indicates Logical OR (set union), \nupper case letters indicate the presence of factors, and lower case letters indicate their absence. In this fictional \nexample of causal heterogeneity, the equation indicates that there are two causal paths to the outcome Y. The \nfirst, captured by the causal configuration A*B*c involves the conjoined presence in the case of features A \nand B, combined with the absence of C. The second, captured by A*C*D*E, requires the joint presence of A, \nC, D and E. Either of these causal configurations is sufficient for the outcome to occur, but neither is \nnecessary, considered alone. The factor C behaves differently in the two configurations. The factor B in this \nequation is an example of what are termed INUS conditions. An INUS condition is \u201ean insufficient but non-\nredundant part of an unnecessary but sufficient condition\u201f (Mackie, 1980, p. 62). Cartwright & Stegenga \n(2008) have argued, compellingly, that all causes are in fact INUS conditions, but that the reverse is not \nnecessarily true. \nWanting to move away from a purely critical stance on regression modelling, Ragin (1987, 2000, 2008), in the \ncontext of political science, has developed both an account of and tools for this set theoretic analytic approach, \nbuilding on the assumptions of qualitative case study but coupling these with an avowedly \u201escientific\u201f \napproach to social science not, in recent years at least, usually associated with that tradition. Ragin has argued \nthat a concern with net effects has severely limited the progress of social science and has shifted his attention \nto complex configurational causation, to INUS conditions, to necessity and sufficiency. In his Qualitative \nComparative Analysis (QCA), which draws on Mill\u201fs logic as developed by Mackie, combinations of the \npresence and\/or absence of usually non-independent factors are seen as the necessary and\/or sufficient \nconditions for outcomes to occur. Multiple causal paths to outcomes are seen as characterising much of the \nsocial world. Causal heterogeneity across types of cases is something to be expected, with the effects of \nparticular causes depending on the configurations of other factors characterising the case (George & Bennett, \n2005; Mahoney, 2008).  \nIn the context of education, for example, the causal role of ability might be expected to differ not only in \nrelation to the social class and gender of an individual, but also by the type of educational regime within \nwhich the child\u201fs career is played out, and perhaps by the interaction between these. More generally, much \ntheoretical argument in the sociology of education implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, addresses non-\nlinearity and\/or relations of necessity and sufficiency. For example: \n\uf0b7 Boudon (1974a) accounts for the social distribution of educational achievement in terms of primary \nand secondary effects. The primary effects of social class create some part of the differences in \nmeasured ability\/achievement early in a child\u201fs career while secondary effects, arising from the ways \nin which the perceived costs and benefits of subsequent educational decisions vary by class origin, \nlead to further class differentiation of outcomes, even amongst those with similar levels of early \nachievement. This account has a clear affinity with a description of the form, \u201eearly achievement is \nnecessary but not sufficient for later achievement\u201f. \n\uf0b7 Bourdieu\u201fs theory of capitals has included, at various times, the claim that educational capital has to \nbe combined with other forms of capital to receive its full economic and social return. Here, \neducational capital is not sufficient for certain outcomes unless conjoined with other forms such as \nsocial capital (Bourdieu, 1974).  \n\uf0b7 Turner\u201fs (1960) classic ideal typical account of the then school systems in the USA and England \nimplies that educational success is a function of the interaction of the stratification regime and an \nindividual\u201fs characteristics. \n\uf0b7 Lacey\u201fs (1970) Hightown Grammar included the claim that the reaction of boys to academic pressure \nin the grammar school was a function of their class origin \/ relevant family resources rather than \nsimply linear. \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n6 \n \n \n\uf0b7 Cooper and Dunne (2000), in their sociological analysis of national testing in mathematics in \nEngland, showed how, given class differences in semantic orientation, particular forms of test item \ncould, for children from particular class backgrounds, render mathematical knowledge necessary but \nnot sufficient for success, while other forms could even render such knowledge unnecessary (see \nCooper & Harries (2009) for further evidence).  \n \nNone of these theoretical accounts of causal processes are simply linear. The ideal typical relation for linear \nregression has the same form as Hooke\u201fs Law describing the effect of increased force on the extension of a \nspring. None of these examples have an affinity with this ideal typical case of a causally homogeneous linear \nrelation. They do seem, on the other hand, to have an affinity with the set theoretic, configurational, approach. \nWe have used the configurational \/ set theoretic approach in analysing survey data on class, education and \nmobility (e.g. Cooper, 2005a, 2006; Cooper & Glaesser, 2007, 2008a,b; Glaesser, 2008). In this paper, we will \ndraw on this experience to make some general critical arguments concerning the over-reliance on correlational \nways of thinking in quantitative educational research and to illustrate how the set theoretic alternative can \nprovide a fruitful alternative approach. We have chosen to focus our discussion on one running example, the \nvarying relationship between measured ability\n5\n and eventual educational achievement across types of cases.  \nIn this paper, rather than focusing on the differences between these two approaches as they appear in the \nsummary equations that finalise analyses of datasets, we concentrate on the properties of the basic building \nblocks of the two competing approaches. For most regression analyses, the basic building block is linear \ncorrelation. For the configurational approach it is the set theoretic concept of a sufficient and\/or necessary \ncondition. Our strategy will be to begin with a discussion of an artificially created sample of 194 cases for \nwhom we have invented data on ability, later achievement and social class. The discussion of these fictional \ncases will allow us to bring out some clear differences between the correlational and the set theoretic \napproaches.  First, we show that there are features of this dataset that correlational methods miss. Since these \nmissed features \u2013 by our design \u2013 concern relations of sufficiency and necessity, we need a set theoretic \napproach to describe them. We therefore then interrupt our discussion to introduce the basic elements of the \nset theoretic approach as developed mainly by Charles Ragin. We then use this approach to make sense of the \n\u201eanomalies\u201f that arose in our correlational analysis of the invented dataset. Having shown that the set theoretic \napproach can make better sense of the invented dataset than the correlational approach, we then move to \npresent some comparable real results, drawing on some new analyses of data from the National Child \nDevelopment Study (NCDS). We will make considerable use of graphical representation.  \n \n \nThe artificial dataset: a correlational analysis \n \nThere are several reasons for including this simulation, including: \n1. To discuss the causal homogeneity assumption and illustrate the ways in which it can mislead. \n2. To remind us that correlations can be improved by modelling causal heterogeneity6, i.e. by taking \naccount of types of cases. \n3. To remind us that correlations of the same size can arise from different forms of relationship. \n4. To indicate that these different forms of relationship sometimes can be described better and\/or more \nreadily in terms of set theoretic models than linear algebraic models. \n \nThe invented dataset for our discussion comprises 194 cases, organised into three types of case, differentiated \nby a respondent\u201fs belonging to one of three social classes of origin. The two other variables are each \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n7 \n \n \nrespondent\u201fs (early) ability and (later) achievement. These two variables have been scaled 0-1 to facilitate our \nsubsequent comparison with a set theoretic analysis of these invented data. In constructing the dataset, we \nhave chosen values for ability and achievement for each case, taking social class into account, in order that \nour analysis of the dataset will be able to demonstrate an important point. This is simply that conventional \ncorrelational analyses of data may not bring out the existence of important relations of sufficiency and\/or \nnecessity in a dataset. That the relations between the variables in our invented dataset are not only \npedagogically useful but also happen to have some similarity with empirical relations in the social world will \nbecome clear later in the paper, when we turn to analyse data from the NCDS.  \nThe discussion of the invented dataset will be organised around simple scatterplots of achievement by ability. \nFigure 1 is the basic scatterplot of achievement against ability for these cases, with the size of each rhombus \nindicating the number of cases at any point. A linear regression line has been fitted. \n \nFigure 1: achievement by ability (invented data for 194 cases) \n \nMany elementary textbooks would describe this, by inspection, we think, as a moderate to strong relationship \nwith possible outliers. The correlation between achievement and ability, with all cases taken together, is 0.60, \nwith unadjusted variance explained therefore of 0.36\n7\n.  \nOur next step is to introduce the data on class origin for these cases, i.e. to explore whether there might be \ncausal heterogeneity across our three types here. First, though, in Table 1 are the means and variances for \nability and achievement by class, with class 1 having the highest mean scores for both ability and \nachievement. (The greater variance for ability than for achievement in classes 1 and 3 might, for someone \nreflecting carefully on these parameters, indicate something important.) \nTable 2 provides the correlations of achievement and ability by class, with the fact that they\u201fve risen over the \noverall correlation (from 0.601 to 0.739) suggesting that there is some sort of causal heterogeneity across \nclasses here. A regression of achievement on ability for each class taken separately would give us, for each, an \nunadjusted variance explained of 0.739\n \nsquared, i.e. 0.546, against the figure for the dataset taken as a whole \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n8 \n \n \nof 0.361. Something clearly was lost when the cases were considered together. Recognising causal \nheterogeneity here \u2013 i.e. the existence of three types of cases \u2013 improves the predictive power of the \nregression models considerably.  \n \nTable 1: Ability and achievement: means and variances by class (for the invented data) \n \nsocial class of origin   N Minimum Maximum Mean Variance \nClass 1 Ability 43 .150 .960 .53581 .043 \n Achievement 43 .350 1.000 .75140 .031 \nClass 2 Ability 78 .150 .870 .49679 .033 \n  Achievement 78 .200 .890 .49724 .032 \nClass 3 Ability 73 .100 .960 .48056 .058 \n  Achievement 73 .050 .800 .30278 .035 \n       \nAll cases together Ability 194 .100 .960 .49934 .045 \n Achievement 194 .050 1.000 .48040 .061 \n \n \nTable 2: Correlations between achievement and ability by class (for the invented data) \n \n Pearson Correlation n \nClass 1 0.739 43 \nClass 2 0.739 78 \nClass 3 0.739 73 \n \nThe three coefficients are, by design of our dataset, identical. The question remains, though, what their being \nidentical does or doesn\u201ft signify. Though many introductory textbooks forget to remind their readers of the \nfact, Pearson\u201fs correlation coefficient is designed for linear relationships. Since many relationships are not \nlinear, we cannot assume that our identical coefficients indicate that the functional form of the relationship \nbetween ability and achievement is of the same nature within each of our three classes.  \n \nIn this case, does linear correlational modelling capture the functional form of the achievement\/ability \nrelationship equally well in the three class contexts? With this question in mind, in Figures 2-4 we show the \nscattergrams for the relation we\u201fre focussing on broken down by class (with y=x lines added to facilitate our \nlater discussion of an alternative set theoretic analysis). Figure 5, the scattergram for all cases, is reproduced \nhere to facilitate visual comparison with these graphs. Those readers familiar with regression modelling \u2013 \nassuming they belong to the subset of such readers who pay attention to the finer points of their models \u2013 will \nhave observed that the three scatterplots in Figures 2-4 are not of the same type. Indeed, of the three plots of \nresiduals by predicted achievement (not shown here) only that for class 2 shows no problems with the linear \nregression model. Each of the other two \u2013 for classes 1 and 3 \u2013 show a pattern8 \u201eindicative of \u201dabnormalities\u201d \nthat require corrective attention\u201f, to quote a classic SPSS manual (Nie et al., 1975, p. 342, our emphasis). \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n9 \n \n \n \nNow, an \u201eabnormality\u201f is only such within some set of modelling assumptions. Rather than address these \n\u201eabnormalities\u201f within a regression framework, we are now going to turn to an alternative framework \u2013 the set \ntheoretic approach \u2013 which has an intrinsic affinity with the relationships between achievement and ability in \nclasses 1 and 3. In doing so, we will, by shifting our underlying mathematical approach from the linear \nalgebraic to the set theoretic, effectively transform these \u201eabnormalities\u201f to \u201enormalities\u201f.   \nFigure 2: Class 1 (invented data, n=43)                             Figure 3: Class 2 (invented data, n=78) \n \n      Figure 4: Class 3 (invented data, n=73) \n \n \n    Figure 5: All cases (invented data, n=194) \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause we are working with scaled, i.e. non-dichotomous, data, we will need to employ a fuzzy set theoretic \napproach. Given the unfamiliarity of this approach we will now interrupt our discussion of these 194 cases in \norder to introduce the basic features of the set theoretic approach. Having done that, we will return to these \nthree relationships between achievement and ability by class, treating them in terms of fuzzy sets, and \nreinterpreting them in the set theoretic language of necessary and\/or sufficient conditions. \n \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n10 \n \n \n \nBasics of the set theoretic approach \n \nConventional sets are not, of course, fuzzy. Cases are either in or out of any set. If we were to dichotomise our \ntwo scales we could create sets of high ability and high achieving individuals. Forgetting our 194 cases for the \nmoment, let us instead imagine some other artificial datasets for which we have this information. The Venn \ndiagram in Figure 6 shows a case of perfect sufficiency (logical and, plausibly, causal). The condition set, that \ncontaining cases with high ability, is a subset of the outcome set, containing all cases achieving highly. It is \nimportant to note that while high ability is sufficient for high achievement here, it is not necessary. There are \nmembers of the set of high achievers who are not of high ability (the yellow subset). In this imaginary world \nthere are other routes, or causal paths to high achievement. Of course, in the real social world there are not \nlikely to be many relationships as simple and apparently deterministic as this. The next example addresses \nthis. \nFigure 7 is only slightly different, but the difference is a crucial one. Here, in another entirely imaginary \nworld, a small proportion of the membership of the high ability set (shown in red) is not contained within the \nset of high achievers. We do not have a relationship of perfect subsethood and therefore of perfect sufficiency. \nWe do, however, have something that approaches it. This is termed in the literature either quasi-sufficiency, \nnear sufficiency or probabilistic sufficiency. Clearly, there can be degrees of it. The proportion of the \ncondition set that is contained within the outcome set can be used as a simple measure of the consistency of \nthe relationship with one of perfect sufficiency (Ragin, 2006b).  \nIn one strand of the qualitative tradition of case study \u2013 one where causes are still happily discussed \u2013 and also \nin the literature on QCA, a likely next analytic move for Figure 7 would be to identify some other causal \nfactor which, combined with high ability, would characterise just those cases who are within the set of high \nachievers (i.e. the green subset). Perhaps they are of high ability and not from a lower class background, for \nexample. We would then have here a simple example of a conjunctural or configurational cause: being of high \nability and not of lower class origin, conjoined, would be sufficient for the outcome.  \nFigure 6: Perfect sufficiency of high ability for  Figure 7: Quasi-sufficiency of high ability for \nhigh achievement in some imaginary world        high achievement in another imaginary world \n \n  \n  \nWhile we are examining these diagrams we should also mention the concept of explanatory coverage (Ragin, \n2006b). In Figure 6 the proportion of the high achievers set that is overlapped by the high ability set is clearly \nthe proportion of those with the outcome \u201eexplained\u201f by their having high ability (subject to this claim making \ntheoretical sense). Coverage in the set theoretic approach is analogous to variance explained in the regression \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n11 \n \n \napproach and can be partitioned similarly in more complicated set theoretic models where there are multiple \ncausal paths to an outcome (Ragin, 2008).  \nWe have shown that sufficiency, in the set theoretic context, is equivalent to a subset relationship. The \ncondition set must be a subset (or near subset) of the outcome set. In the case of necessity, this is reversed, and \nthe outcome set must be a subset of the condition set\n9\n. Figure 8 shows a situation in which the high achievers \nare a subset of those with high ability. Here, high ability is necessary (logically and, plausibly, causally) for \nhigh achievement, but it is not sufficient. Again, the analyst might want to explore factors that, combined with \nhigh ability, created combinations of conditions that were also sufficient. Being of high ability and from a \nhigh social origin might be a candidate configuration.  \n \nFigure 8: Perfect necessity of high ability for high achievement  \nin yet another imaginary world \n \n \n \nTable 3: Membership in the sets \u2018high achiever\u2019 and \u2018high ability\u2019 \n \n Not high achiever High achiever \nHigh Ability Cell 1  Cell 2 \nNot high ability Cell 3 Cell 4 \n \nThese subset relationships can also be discussed in the context of crosstabulations of membership in two sets \n(Boudon, 1974b; Ragin, 2000). In the tradition of correlational analysis, there is a concern with symmetry. For \na high correlation we would want cases mainly in both of cells 2 and 3 of Table 3\n10\n. However, a concern with \nsufficiency (or necessity) moves us away from this concern with symmetry. To test whether high ability is \nsufficient for high achievement, we only need to look at the first row, containing cells 1 and 2. The crucial \nthing is that there be no (or very few) cases in cell 1, since these contradict the claim that being of high ability \nis sufficient (or quasi-sufficient) for high achievement. Similarly, for necessity of high ability for high \nachievement, we only need to look at cells 2 and 4, and we don\u201ft want to see cases in cell 4. If we were testing \nfor joint sufficiency and necessity of high ability for achievement, we would, of course, want to see no (or \nfew) cases in cells 1 and 4.  \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n12 \n \n \nSo far, we have discussed crisp sets \u2013 those where a case simply is either in or out of a set, i.e. whose set \nmembership is numerically given as either one or zero. Those familiar with the history of mathematics will \nnot be surprised to learn that mathematicians have developed an account of sets, usually termed fuzzy sets, \nwhere membership is allowed to vary between these limits of zero and full membership. An example often \nused to illustrate partial membership is that of adulthood (Kosko, 1994). While most judges would agree that \nan age of ten would rule out adulthood (giving a membership score of zero) and one of 30 would rule it in \n(giving a membership score of one), there would be much more discussion about the age range 15 to 21, \ncharacterised by ambiguity. Here it would seem inappropriate to allocate a score of either zero or one \u2013 the \nonly possibilities available in the crisp set context. In fuzzy set based descriptions of cases a score of 0.9 \nmight be used for the 20 year-old to indicate almost full, but not quite full, membership of the set of \u201eadults'. \nA nineteen year-old might be allocated a score of 0.8\n11\n. \nThe operations of conventional set theory (intersection, union, negation, subsethood, etc.) all have equivalents \nin fuzzy set theory (Goertz, 2006; Ragin, 2000; Smithson & Verkuilen, 2006). There is considerable ongoing \ndebate within mathematics about the best way to define some of these operators in the fuzzy set context. We \nwill use some commonly agreed and fairly intuitive versions. For example, the simplest way of assessing \nfuzzy subsethood uses an arithmetic approach. If the membership of a case in set A is less than or equal to its \nmembership in set B, then this case passes the test for fuzzy subsethood (also called fuzzy inclusion). The \nproportion of cases with non-zero membership in the condition set A passing such a test can be used as a \nsimple test of consistency with a relationship of sufficiency for some outcome set B (for a fuller account of the \ndevelopment of more complex measures of consistency with sufficiency and necessity in Ragin\u201fs work, see \nCooper, 2005b). We will introduce other definitions as and when required.  \nWe will now return to our 194 invented cases. From this point we will assume that our 0-1 scales for ability \nand achievement have arisen from a fuzzy calibration of these two factors, i.e. they are measures of partial \nmembership in two fuzzy sets.  \n \nThe artificial dataset: a (fuzzy) set theoretic analysis \nFirst, we need to look again at the scatterplots (Figures 2-4). Simple inspection shows that the three graphs by \nclass have different forms. Figure 2, for class 1, has all cases above or on the y=x line and is usually called an \nupper triangular plot (Ragin, 2000). Figure 4, for class 3, has all cases below or on the y=x line and is usually \ncalled a lower triangular plot. Figure 3, for class 2, is, more or less, characterised by reflective symmetry \naround the y=x line. \nWhat, within a set theoretic approach, do these features indicate? We have already explained the simple \narithmetic test for fuzzy subsethood.  If we take Figure 2 for class 1, we can see that, for each case, the \nmembership in ability is less than or equal to its membership in achievement. In fuzzy set terms, the ability set \nis a subset of the achievement set. Ability is sufficient for achievement. More intuitively, across the whole \nrange of ability, a case\u201fs partial membership in the ability set is an effective floor below which its membership \nin the achievement set doesn\u201ft fall. Ability is not however necessary for achievement. This must be so, within \nthe rules of fuzzy set theory, since the relevant test cannot be passed (for necessity, y scores must be lower to \nor equal to x scores). More intuitively, this can be seen by noting that high membership scores in achievement \ncan be gained \u2013 in this imaginary world \u2013 with fairly low membership scores in ability. The upper triangular \nplot represents, then, a sufficient but not necessary relationship. In this imaginary world, there must be other \ncausal paths to high achievement than simply ability alone (involving, one might speculate, such enabling \nconjoined factors as private tuition, private schooling, support from highly educated parents, etc.). \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n13 \n \n \nSimilar reasoning shows that Figure 4, for class 3, represents a necessary but not sufficient relationship. Here \nmembership in ability sets a ceiling for achievement, but there are cases where achievement does not seem to \nreflect ability as strongly as in others. Here, we can speculate, there must be other conjoined constraining \nfactors that explain these cases\u201f positions away from the diagonal (perhaps such conjoined constraining \nfactors as poverty, etc.). \nClearly, we invented our 194 cases so that these two graphs would show perfect triangular plots. The simple \narithmetic index of consistency with sufficiency (the proportion of cases with ability less than or equal to \nachievement) has its maximum value of 1 for class 1, and the analogous measure of necessity here is near \nzero. The pattern is reversed for class 3. What about class 2 (Figure 3)? This looks more like a textbook \nscatterplot, of course. The simple measure of sufficiency is 0.59 and of necessity is 0.54\n12\n. Even allowing \nquasi-sufficiency, we would not want to argue that, for class 2, ability is either sufficient or necessary for \nachievement. It might be, of course, when conjoined with some additional factors, but we have not designed \nour dataset set to explore such complexities. We can, however, note that the relation for class 2 is more-or-less \nsymmetric. These results, together with those for the 194 cases taken as one group, are set out in Table 4\n13\n.  \n \nTable 4: Set theoretic testing of the ability => achievement relationship (n=194, invented data) \n \nSimple inclusion algorithm Sufficiency Necessity Result: Ability is \u2026 \nAll classes together 0.459 0.598 Neither sufficient nor necessary \nClass 1 1.000 0.023 Sufficient but not necessary \nClass 2 0.590 0.539 Neither sufficient nor necessary \nClass 3 0.000 1.000 Necessary but not sufficient \n \nBy presenting the analysis separately by class \u2013 in order to bring out the phenomenon of causal heterogeneity \n\u2013 we have moved the configurational nature of this analysis temporarily offstage. However, an examination of \nTable 4 allows us to write this simple example of a configurational set theoretic equation concerning \nsufficiency: \nCLASS_1*ABILITY => ACHIEVEMENT \nwhere capital letters indicate membership in the sets and the asterisk indicates set intersection. Ability, then, is \nsufficient for achievement \u2013 in this imaginary world \u2013 when it is conjoined with membership in class 1.  \nWe created this example to illustrate an important point. A correlational approach, because it assumes \nlinearity as a default, is not well-suited to address causality understood in terms of necessity and sufficiency. \nIndeed, we have shown how three identical correlation coefficients can be associated with three different \nforms of set theoretic relationship. What about real social data? How might we apply these ideas and \ntechniques to bring out any complex asymmetric causality that characterises the social world? In the next \nsection we will provide an illustration, drawing on the NCDS. \n \n \nSocial class and educational achievement in the NCDS: an illustration of the set theoretic analytic \napproach \n \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n14 \n \n \nOur purpose here is illustrative. We compare the merits of set theoretic and correlational descriptions of the \nability\/achievement relationship across types of conjuncturally defined cases. The relationship between these \nvariables seems likely, given the claims of such sociologists as Boudon and Bourdieu, to vary, non-linearly, \nacross types of classed and gendered cases. As we have shown above, a set theoretic approach should be an \nappropriate and fruitful way to elucidate any such causal complexity\n14\n. Specifically, we assess the set theoretic \nquasi-sufficiency of ability for achievement over types of cases defined by configurations of the conditions \nfather\u201fs class, grandfathers\u201f class and sex. We demonstrate that causal heterogeneity characterises the \nability\/achievement relationship, and that it has the same form as that described for our invented dataset. \n \nData and variables \nThe NCDS is an ongoing longitudinal study of individuals born in one week in March 1958. We use a sample \nof 5117 cases from the NCDS with no missing values on the variables we employ here (and also class at birth, \nwhich we are using in some extended analyses not reported here)\n15\n. Measured ability (n920) is taken at age 11. \nThe measure of achievement, highest qualifications obtained, is taken at age 33 and includes both academic \nand vocational qualifications (HQUAL). Because of the ways each grandfather\u201fs class was recorded we will \nbe using the categories of the Registrar General\u201fs scheme for these, but we will be using an approximation to \nGoldthorpe\u201fs class scheme for the respondent\u201fs father\u201fs16 class (at the respondent\u201fs age of 11). Given the \nillustrative nature of the analysis here, this mixing of categories, though undesirable, is of no consequence, we \nbelieve, for our arguments.  We have, of course, to calibrate, as fuzzy sets, the original distribution of scores \nfor the measures of highest qualification and ability. For highest qualifications we have used the calibration \nemployed for another purpose in Cooper (2005a) which ranges from a membership of 0 for no qualification to \n1 for a degree or better\n17\n. For measured ability, we have employed a very simple calibration (a linear \ntransformation) which just rescales the original scores (0-80) to 0-1\n18\n.  \n \n \nCausal heterogeneity: how does the ability\/achievement relation vary by class background? \nBefore presenting evidence of causal heterogeneity in these data, we should provide the summary picture for \nall of the cases taken together. Figure 9 shows the distribution of achievement by ability for the 5117 cases, \nwith the size of each rhombus indicating the number of cases at any point. A linear regression line has been \nfitted. The correlation coefficient is 0.535, with variance explained of 0.286. The scatterplot looks, at this \nglobal level, like a textbook example of a linear relation with a moderate correlation coefficient. \nWe can begin our exploration of heterogeneity with a hypothetical argument about likely relations. If we \nconsider two contrasting sets of cases (i.e. configurations of factors), males with a class of origin towards the \ntop of the social class distribution who also had grandfathers towards the top of this distribution, and then, by \ncontrast, females who had fathers and grandfathers towards the bottom of the distribution, we can hypothesise, \nfrom the literature on class, gender and schooling in the relevant period, that ability might have tended \ntowards being a sufficient condition for achievement for the former group (but perhaps not a necessary one) \nand towards being a necessary condition for the latter group (but perhaps not a sufficient one). As explained \nearlier, if this is so, we should expect an upper triangular plot of achievement against ability in the first case \nand a lower triangular plot in the second.  \nFigure 9: Achievement by ability with regression line (n=5117, from NCDS) \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n15 \n \n \n \nTaking these two subsets identified for our initial exploration, the two contrasting graphs in Figures 10 and 11 \nshow the relevant scatterplots. In Figure 10 the cases are 60 males whose father was in Goldthorpe\u201fs class 1 \n(the upper service class) and whose grandfathers were both in either Registrar General\u201fs social class I or II. In \nFigure 11 the cases are the 94 females whose own father was in Goldthorpe\u201fs class 7 (the semi and unskilled \nmanual working class) and whose grandfathers were both in RG class IV or V. The correlation between \nachievement and ability for the 60 males with the configuration capturing higher social origins here is 0.505 \nand for the 94 females with lower origins it is 0.472. These linear measures of the relationship suggest no \nimportant difference. However, an inspection of the scatterplots suggests that there is an important difference \nand that it is as predicted, with tendencies to triangular plots being clear to see. \n \nFigure 10: 60 males from high class origins           Figure 11: 94 females from low class origins \n \n \n \n \n \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n16 \n \n \nWe cannot, of course, expect perfect triangular plots to turn up in an exploration of relations in the social \nworld. Why not? The adequacy of the fuzzy set calibrations will be a contributory factor, as well as \nmeasurement error, plus the fact that this is a very simple model omitting many factors, and also the role of \n\u201echance\u201f, however understood. Nevertheless, Figure 10 tends to the form of an upper triangular plot \n(sufficient, but not necessary) and Figure 11 to the form of a lower triangular plot (necessary, but not \nsufficient). If we calculate the simple fuzzy inclusion indices\n19\n of consistency with sufficiency and necessity \nwe obtain, for Figure 10, values of 0.833 and 0.167 respectively. For Figure 11, the pattern is reversed, and we \nobtain 0.207 and 0.721. These values (on a 0-1 scale, recall) bear out the results of the visual inspection. \nSummarising, the clear tendencies are that: \n \n\uf0b7 For the configuration  \nHIGH_GRANDFATHERS\u201f_CLASS*HIGH_FATHER\u201fS_CLASS*MALE,  \nABILITY is sufficient, but not necessary, for later ACHIEVEMENT. \n\uf0b7 For the configuration LOW_GRANDFATHERS\u201f_CLASS*LOW_FATHER\u201fS_CLASS*male,  \nABILITY is necessary, but not sufficient, for later ACHIEVEMENT. \n \nBefore moving on, we can note that a possibly fruitful next stage here would be to zoom in on the cases in \norder to explore what it is about those in Figure 10, for example, that puts some on one side of the sufficiency \nline and some on the necessity side. To some extent very individual factors will be involved (e.g. a bout of bad \nhealth, parental disputes, etc.) but there are also likely to be factors that split these 60 cases into meaningful \nsubtypes (secondary school type and\/or social composition of school attended, etc.). We are currently \nexploring some of these. An issue that arises very quickly \u2013 and one that tends to be glossed over in regression \nstudies \u2013 is that of limited diversity (Ragin, 2006a). Even with large samples, a study employing more than a \nhandful of factors soon encounters cells with few or even zero cases. \nAny such zooming-in, we should note, does not take the form of seeking to control for other independent \nvariables in the way the \u201enet effects\u201f \/ \u201eaverage effects\u201f regression approach does. It rather further specifies the \nnature of a type of case by expanding the configurational description or specification of its type. Here, the \nfactors in the configuration are \u2013 subject to theoretical meaningfulness \u2013 seen as operating conjuncturally \nrather than additively to produce their effects.  For example, a well-off grandfather may have helped with the \nfees necessary to put a son of moderate measured ability who had failed to win a selective grammar school \nplace through a private school. Here, the grandfather\u201fs decision may have acted as an (enabling) switch, \nmoving the child from a non-selective secondary modern school future where academic examinations may not \nhave been available to one where they were, and hence allowing ability to produce its (perhaps moderate) \neffects.  \nWe have obviously, for illustrative purposes, chosen two clearly contrasting examples. We can note, in \npassing, that from the point of view of theory development and testing, this is often an appropriate strategy \n(Seawright & Gerring, 2008). These two graphs would count against any simple theory that claimed that \nability operated causally in the same manner across contexts of social class. The idea of an \u201eaverage effect\u201f of \nability on achievement (though it can be calculated) is not apparently a very useful one here. Having noted \nthis, we can, without producing endless graphs, use the simple indices of consistency with sufficiency and \nnecessity to explore the achievement\/ability relation over various types of cases, setting them alongside \nstandard Pearson correlation coefficients. We will do this in a way that illustrates the zooming-in idea, \nfocussing, given space constraints, on just the sufficiency relationship.  \n \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n17 \n \n \nTable 5 focuses initially on a fairly crude typology \u2013 just considering cases by paternal class of origin. We can \nsee that the correlations vary little by class but that the simple fuzzy inclusion measure of consistency with \nsufficiency varies a lot. While, at this degree of resolution, none of the consistency measures is close to the 1.0 \nthat would indicate perfect sufficiency, there is a clear pattern, with class 1 being nearest to this upper limit \nand class 7 furthest away. On the assumption that there is still likely to be considerable causal heterogeneity \nwithin each of these seven categories, we next aim to reduce this further by adding additional factors to the \none (father\u201fs class) that gives us our types in this table. Theoretically meaningful candidates include sex and \ngrandfathers\u201f class. Let us start by adding sex to give types characterised by father\u201fs class and sex (Table 6). \nOnce again the variability in the correlation measures is small, especially in comparison with the measures of \nconsistency with sufficiency. More importantly, having increased the degree of resolution of our analysis, we \nnow see both increases and decreases beyond the upper and lower limits we found when just class was \nconjoined with ability. For males from class 1 families, the index of consistency with sufficiency is 0.691; for \nfemales from class 7 it is 0.258.  \n \nTable 5: The ability -> achievement relation within types defined by paternal class origin \n \nGoldthorpe \nClass \nCorrelations N Consistency: a measure of the degree to \nwhich ability is sufficient for achievement \n1 0.455 585 0.643 \n2 0.494 876 0.545 \n3 0.457 498 0.464 \n4 0.544 313 0.373 \n5 0.502 322 0.391 \n6 0.486 1612 0.403 \n7 0.496 911 0.320 \n \n \nTable 6: The ability -> achievement relation within types defined jointly by paternal class origin and sex \n \nSex Goldthorpe \nClass \nCorrelations N Consistency: a measure of the degree to \nwhich ability is sufficient for \nachievement \nMale 1 0.468 288 0.691 \nMale 2 0.486 418 0.610 \nMale 3 0.444 246 0.569 \nMale 4 0.516 166 0.463 \nMale 5 0.581 172 0.453 \nMale 6 0.518 775 0.488 \nMale 7 0.503 439 0.386 \nFemale 1 0.453 297 0.596 \nFemale 2 0.520 458 0.485 \nFemale 3 0.490 252 0.361 \nFemale 4 0.616 147 0.272 \nFemale 5 0.438 150 0.320 \nFemale 6 0.478 837 0.325 \nFemale 7 0.510 472 0.258 \n \nB.

We now have cases defined in terms of the factors \nfather\u201fs class, sex and whether grandfathers were in RG class I or II. Even with the grandparental generation \ntreated dichotomously, this step generates a table with 28 rows\n20\n (Table 7). The problem of limited diversity is \nimmediately apparent in Table 7. We would not want to draw strong conclusions from rows with very small \nnumbers (though an in-depth examination of these unusual cases might, if possible errors of measurement or \ndata entry could be ruled out, generate interesting insights). We now have, at this level of resolution, a row (in \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n19 \n \n \nyellow) representing the 60 cases discussed earlier (see Figure 10) with a consistency with sufficiency of \n0.833. For these cases \u2013 defined by class over two generations and gender \u2013 measured ability is close to being \nsufficient for later achievement. This particular sufficiency relation could be written, in set theoretic notation, \nto indicate that, for the configuration FATHER\u201fS_CLASS_1 * GRANDFATHERS\u201f_CLASS_RGI_OR_RGII \n* MALE, ABILITY is quasi-sufficient for ACHIEVEMENT. \nInspection of the table shows other interesting relationships. In particular, several other sets of cases, of both \nsexes, have fairly high indices of consistency with sufficiency. It is also possible to see configurations of class \nand gender where ability is far from being sufficient for achievement (even though our splitting of \ngrandfathers towards the top end of the social structure will tend to dilute such relationships). For example, for \nfemales from paternal social class 7, not having both grandfathers in RG class I or II, the index of consistency \nis just 0.257. For these cases, ability was clearly not sufficient for later achievement. We could present a \nsimilar tabular analysis for other levels and categories of the social class factors, and for necessity in addition \nto sufficiency, but won\u201ft, for reasons of space. The crucial point to note is that the correlation coefficients in \nTable 7 do not provide the insights provided by the set theoretic index of sufficiency.  \nWe should add that, in the same way as a regression equation can be written to summarise the overall patterns \nof relationship between a dependent variable and some \u201eindependent\u201f variables in a dataset, a set theoretic \nequation can also be written to summarise those configurations of conditions that are sufficient for some \noutcome (with a form similar to the example we used earlier from Mahoney and Goertz\u201fs paper; see Ragin, \n2000).  We have no space to explain and illustrate this here (for a worked example for the dataset analysed \nhere, see Cooper & Glaesser, 2009). \n \nConclusion \nThe debate that arose concerning Bhaskar\u201fs (1975, 1979) realist accounts of both natural and social science \n(e.g. Pawson, 1989; Ron, 2002) was, in part, focussed on the role regularities play in constructing causal \naccounts. From the perspective of early Bhaskarian realism, regularities were neither sufficient nor necessary \nfor the establishment of knowledge concerning causal\/generative mechanisms. They are not sufficient, if only \nbecause correlations are not always causal. They are not necessary, if only because complex interacting \nmechanisms in open systems can lead to the blocking of causal tendencies. These are sound arguments. \nHowever, it is important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Regularities can appear in open \nsystems, though they may be less than perfect and may be complex in nature. They can also be made visible in \nclosed systems, such as those artificially closed systems produced in experiments (Bhaskar, 1975; Cartwright, \n1999). In the analysis of survey data, they can be expected to be more readily found when causal \nheterogeneity is correctly identified and taken into account, i.e. when types of cases are correctly identified, as \nwe have shown here. By looking at relationships within the context of configurationally defined types, we \nhave aimed to create a set of relatively closed systems in each of which the specific nature of the relationship \nbetween ability and achievement could be better discerned. \nIn open systems, since it is always likely that several causes will interact to produce the observed relationships \nin a dataset, the social scientist needs special tools to make visible the regularities associated with any \nparticular subset of variables. The standard technique for producing\/analysing the regularities arising from the \naction of any particular factor, net of the effects of other factors, is regression, built on the basis of correlation. \nRon (2002) has argued that realists should not, contrary to the claims of some, underestimate the usefulness of \nthis set of techniques. Nor do we, especially if what is wanted is knowledge of some average effect. On the \nother hand, the question must be asked, is regression-based modelling, built on the assumption of causally \nindependent variables and linear algebraic correlation, likely to have a greater or lesser affinity with the \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n20 \n \n \ncomplex causality that characterises the social world than the set theoretic approach, built on the assumption \nof conjunctural causation and the concept of a sufficient and\/or necessary condition? We are suggesting that, \nin some contexts, including that of the sociology of class and educational achievement, the answer may be that \ncorrelation-based regression models have a lesser affinity than set theoretic ones.  \nPawson (2008) has recently stressed what is common to some uses of correlational methods (by \n\u201esucessionists\u201f) and set theoretic methods (by \u201econfigurationists\u201f) \u2013 a failure to focus on generative \nmechanisms in their search for the answers to \u201ewhy?\u201f questions. He recommends a realist approach, focussing \non such mechanisms, in their place. We are sympathetic to his critique. However, we would argue that, in the \ndevelopment and testing of theories that are themselves formulated \u2013 or can be appropriately reformulated \u2013 in \nthe language of INUS conditions, of complex relations of sufficiency and necessity, the set theoretic approach \nis likely to be more useful than regression modelling for describing\/testing empirical consequences, simply \nbecause the functional forms it employs have a greater affinity with the claims of such theories. Complex \ncausality in the world requires appropriately complex models. The discussion earlier of our two examples, one \ninvented, one real, was intended to provide some arguments and evidence for this claim.  \n \nReferences \nAbell, P.

Notwithstanding the use of \nquantitative indicators in the not so distant past (Lacey\u201fs, Hargreaves\u201f, Ball\u201fs and others\u201f studies of ability grouping all \nemployed these long before \u201emixed methods\u201f became a focus of discussion), much recent case-based work in the \nsociology of education has eschewed numbers and formal analytic procedures. \n2\n See, for example, all four papers in the October 2008 issue of Sociology of Education. \n3\n For example, via the use of multilevel modelling in school effectiveness studies. \n4 This example assumes no empirical exceptions.  \n5\n Or early attainment, if some readers prefer that interpretation. \n6\n This can be addressed in a regression framework too, of course, but in a correlational rather than a set theoretic manner, \ni.e. in a way that assumes that \u201enet effects\u201f of individual variables are meaningful. See Clark et al. (2006) for an \ninteresting relevant discussion. \nB. Cooper and J. Glaesser\/ Methodological Innovations Online (2010) 5(1) 4-23 \n23 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n7\n A visual examination of the residuals plotted against the predicted value of achievement suggests no major problems \nwith the regression model. It is always possible, of course, to play at (descriptive) curve fitting to improve variance \nexplained. If we do this, using SPSS, we can raise the variance explained from 0.36 by using either a power curve (to \n0.44) or an S curve (to 0.46). \n8\n The plots for classes 1 and 3 have a conical \/ funnel shape. \n9\n In these simple cases, the proportional measure of the extent to which ability is necessary for achievement is equal to \nthe explanatory coverage of ability for achievement when the sufficiency of ability for achievement is assessed. \n10\n Or, alternatively, but less realistically given the example being used, in 1 and 4. \n11\n A crucial difference from an interval scale measure for age should be noted. All ages over some threshold will here \nreceive a score of one, indicating full membership of the set. From the set theoretic perspective, differences over this \nthreshold are not relevant ones. Whether this calibration decision is actually appropriate in any particular context is a \nmatter, of course, of the relevant kinds that exist in the social world and of their causal properties.  \n12\n Given some cases are on the y=x line, these don\u201ft add to one. \n13\n An analysis using a more sophisticated measure of consistency (Ragin, 2008, p. 52) produces the same pattern of \nresults, though, depending on where thresholds for quasi-sufficiency are set, can allow class 2 and the overall sample to \nbe described as showing quasi-sufficiency and quasi-necessity. \n14\n In this discussion we are, of course, using \u201esummarising\u201f variables. The actual mechanisms and\/or processes by which \n\u201eclass\u201f produces its causal effects are not our focus in this paper. Instead, we are attending to competing forms of \ndescription that might have greater or less affinity with the sorts of regularities, or tendencies towards them, that \nunderlying causal mechanisms and processes produce. \n15\n As is common in analyses of these data, our sample is much smaller than the original cohort, partly through attrition, \npartly because of missing values on these variables. \n16\n There are no data on grandmothers and we use paternal class for the family to avoid the loss of many more cases that \nwould arise were we to use a maternal measure. \n17\n This is calibrated as a fuzzy set thus: No qualification: 0; CSE 2-5 \/ equiv NVQ1: 0.17; O Level \/ equiv NVQ2: 0.42; A \nLevel \/ equiv NVQ3: 0.67; Higher qualification NVQ4: 0.83; Degree \/ higher NVQ5 , 6: 1.0 . \n18\n Cooper (2005a) used a more complex calibration in line with the particular purposes of that paper. Here, our purpose is \nto illustrate the potential of the set theoretic approach as transparently as possible and, for this reason, we have chosen \nthis simple approach. On the crucial importance of calibration, see Ragin (2006a, 2008). \n19\n It is important to note that these are calculated only for cases with some degree of membership in the condition set \n(sufficiency) or in the outcome set (necessity) respectively, while the correlation coefficient is calculated for all cases.  \n20\n Within it, of course, we would expect the rows where GFs_I_II=1 to be more homogeneous that those where \nGFs_I_II=0.  \n__________________________________________________ \n \n \nBiographies \n \nBarry Cooper is a Professor of Education in the School of Education at Durham University where he was, \nfrom 1998 to 2005, Director of Research.
