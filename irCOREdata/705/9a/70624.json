Early suggestions by Minkowski\n[1] and Abraham [2] for the structure of its electromagnetic component in\nsimple media initiated a long debate involving both theoretical and exper-\nimental contributions that continues to the current time (see e.g. [3], [4],\n[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]). Disputes developed because different\nproposals to describe the interaction of light with media were adopted and\nsubsequent experiments were unable to resolve their conflicting predictions.\nAlthough it is widely recognised today that this controversy is an argument\nabout definitions [13], [14], [15], [17] and that the relative merits of alternative\ndefinitions are undecidable without a complete (experimentally verifiable) co-\nvariant description of relativistic continuum mechanics for matter and fields,\nthe absence of a compelling derivation of a total relativistic stress-energy-\nmomentum tensor that can effectively model the phenomenological response\nof moving media to electromagnetic fields is surprising.\nIf stress-energy-momentum tensors are defined as appropriate variational\nderivatives of an action functional, a mathematically precise and physically\ncogent derivation of a symmetric tensor can be effected. In this letter we\nreport that both the original phenomenological proposals by Minkowski and\nAbraham can be viewed in this context and correspond to different choices for\nthe response of a linear constitutive tensor to gravitation. Since it is known\nthat the polarisation and magnetisation of most continua depend on their\nstate of motion the choice made by Abraham (originally in the context of\ninertial motions and zero gravitation) probably offers a more effective contri-\n1\nbution to the total stress-energy-momentum tensor. From this perspective it\nis also argued that if spatial and temporal dispersion are ignorable, the classi-\ncal properties of a linear medium (that may be intrinsically magneto-electric)\ncan be parameterised in terms of a constitutive tensor on spacetime whose\nproperties can in principle be determined by experiments in non-inertial (ac-\ncelerating) frames and in the presence of weak but variable gravitational\nfields.\nBecause the properties of the electromagnetic field are so well understood\nmuch of the experimental information that is collected about nature is me-\ndiated by this field. The predictions of pure quantum electrodynamics have\nbeen experimentally verified to high levels of accuracy and any departures\nfrom these predictions are routinely ascribed to the effects of other interac-\ntions. The classical laws of electrodynamics are also routinely extrapolated\nto describe astrophysical phenomena where matter can exist under extreme\nconditions of temperature, pressure and density. Even on terrestrial scales\nnew states of matter and new materials are regularly being fabricated with\nsurprising electromagnetic properties that are leading to new technological\ndevelopments in communications and nano-science.\nTo fully understand phenomena that are induced in bulk matter by elec-\ntromagnetism on these various scales it is necessary to describe cooperative\neffects induced by the electromagnetic interaction. It is, however, difficult to\naccount fully for such effects in terms of fundamental interactions between\ncharged particles and photons. The versatility of Maxwell\u2019s phenomenolog-\nical field equations owes much to the fact that electromagnetic sources due\nto cooperative effects can be accommodated by using a broad range of con-\nstitutive relations involving a variety of response functions that account for\npolarisation, magnetisation, hysteresis and dispersion in material continua.\nAlthough in principle such response functions can be calculated in terms of\nthe underlying quantum structure of matter in many practical situations the\nconstitutive relations are effectively deduced from experimental data.\nIn order that this procedure achieves more than a convenient parametri-\nsation of a particular set of laboratory observations it is important to em-\nbed the response data into a coherent framework that respects the basic\nprinciples cherished by physical science. For classical electrodynamics these\ninclude the principle that the underlying theory provides relations between\ntensor (and spinor) fields on a four-dimensional spacetime equipped with a\nlight-cone structure and a pseudo-Riemannian geometry responsible for the\neffects ascribed to gravitation. Such a formulation ensures that the results\n2\nof observation on arbitrarily moving continua by observers in arbitrary mo-\ntion (in the presence of an arbitrary gravitational field) are compatible with\nthe established tenets of relativistic field theory [16]. The implementation of\nthis program is non-trivial particularly when thermodynamic constraints are\nincluded for deformable media.\nSome way towards this goal is offered by (covariant) averaging meth-\nods [18], [19]. These however yield non-symmetric stress-energy-momentum\ntensors for electromagnetic fields in simple media. If the total stress-energy-\nmomentum is to remain symmetric this implies that other asymmetric con-\ntributions must compensate and no guidance is offered to account for such\nmaterial induced asymmetries. The need for a symmetric total stress-energy-\nmomentum tensor is often attributed to conservation of total angular mo-\nmentum despite the fact that such global conservation laws may not exist in\narbitrary gravitational fields. Although the magnitude of gravitational in-\nteractions may be totally insignificant compared with the scale of those due\nto electromagnetism, gravity does have relevance in establishing the general\nframework (via the geometry of spacetime) for classical relativistic field the-\nory and in particular this framework offers the most cogent means to define\nthe total stress-energy-momentum tensor as the source of relativistic gravi-\ntation. This in turn may be related to a variational formulation of the fully\ncoupled field system of equations that underpin the classical description of\ninteracting matter in terms of tensor (and spinor) fields on spacetime.\n2 Constitutive Relations\nMaxwell\u2019s equations for an electromagnetic field in an arbitrary medium can\nbe written\ndF = 0 and d ? G = j (1)\nwhere F is the Maxwell 2-form, G is the excitation 2-form and j is the 3-form\nelectric current source1. In general, the effects of gravitation and electromag-\nnetism on matter are encoded in this system in ?G and j. This dependence\n1The Hodge map ? is associated with the metric tensor g of spacetime, d denotes the\nexterior derivative and iX is the contraction operator associated with the vectorX. Details\nof this notation can be found [20]. All tensors in this article have dimensions constructed\nfrom the SI dimensions [M ], [L], [T ], [Q] where [Q] has the unit of the Coulomb in the MKS\nsystem. We adopt [g] = [L2], [G] = [j] = [Q], [F ] = [Q]\/ \u00b20 where the permittivity of free\nspace \u00b20 has the dimensions [Q2 T 2M\u22121 L\u22123] and c denotes the speed of light in vacuo.\n3\nmay be non-linear and non-local. To close this system, \u201c electromagnetic con-\nstitutive relations\u201d relating G and j to F are necessary. In the following the\nmedium will be considered as containing polarisable (both electrically and\nmagnetically) matter with G restricted to a real point-wise linear function of\nF , thereby ignoring losses and spatial and temporal material dispersion in all\nframes 2. Covariant dispersion in linear material has been discussed in the\noptics limit in [21] and the role of the spacetime metric in the constitutive\nformulation of Maxwell\u2019s theory has been analysed in [22].\nThe 1\u2212form electric field e and 1\u2212form magnetic induction field b asso-\nciated with F are defined with respect to an arbitrary unit future-pointing\ntimelike 4\u2212velocity vector field U by\ne = iUF and cb = iU?F . (2)\nSince g(U,U) = \u22121,\nF = e \u2227 U\u02dc \u2212 ? ( cb \u2227 U\u02dc)\nwhere U\u02dc = g(U,\u2212). The field U may be used to describe an observer frame\non spacetime and its integral curves model idealised observers. Likewise the\ndisplacement field d and the magnetic field h associated with G are defined\nwith respect to U by\nd = iUG and h\/ c = iU ? G . (3)\nThus\nG = d \u2227 U\u02dc \u2212 ? ((h\/ c ) \u2227 U\u02dc) .\nIt will be assumed that a material medium has associated with it a future-\npointing timelike unit vector field V which may be identified with the bulk\n4\u2212velocity field of the medium in spacetime. Integral curves of V define the\naveraged world-lines of identifiable constituents of the medium. A comoving\nobserver frame with 4\u2212velocity U will have U = V .\nIn general G may be a functional of F and properties of the medium3,\nG = Z[F, . . .] .\n2The electric current 3\u2212form j will be assumed to describe (mobile) electric charge and\nplays no role in subsequent discussions.\n3e.g. electrostriction and magnetostriction arise from the dependence of Z on the elastic\ndeformation tensor of the medium.\n4\nSuch a functional induces, in general, non-linear and non-local relations be-\ntween the fields d,h and e,b. For general linear continua one may have, for\nsome positive integer N and collection of constitutive tensor fields Z (r) on\nspacetime, the relation\nG = \u03a3Nr=0Z\n(r)(\u2207 rF, . . .)\nin terms of some spacetime connection \u2207. Additional arguments refer to\nvariables independent of F and its derivatives. For the non-dispersive linear\nmedia under consideration here, we restrict to\nG = Z(F ) (4)\nfor some constitutive tensor field Z. In the vacuum G = \u00b20F .\nA particularly simple linear isotropic but inhomogeneous medium may\nbe described by a bulk 4\u2212velocity field V , a relative permittivity scalar field\n\u00b2 and a non-vanishing relative permeability scalar field \u00b5. To a comoving\nobserver (U = V ) with a history that coincides with one of the integral\ncurves of V the local constitutive relations become\nd = \u00b20 \u00b2 e and h = (\u00b50\u00b5)\n\u22121b .\nFor a non-magneto-electric but anisotropic medium, the relative permit-\ntivity \u00b2 and inverse relative permeability \u00b5\u22121 become spatial tensor fields\non spacetime. More generally, the electromagnetic fields measured by a co-\nmoving observer may be related by\nd = \u03b6de(e) + \u03b6db(b) and h = \u03b6he(e) + \u03b6hb(b) (5)\nwhere \u03b6de, \u03b6db, \u03b6he, \u03b6hb are spatial tensors. From (2), (3), (4) it follows that\nthis constitutive relation may be expressed covariantly as\nZ(F ) = \u03b6de(iV F )\u2227V\u02dc + \u03b6db(iV ?F )\u2227V\u02dc \u2212 ?(\u03b6he(iV F )\u2227V\u02dc )\u2212 ?(\u03b6hb(iV ?F )\u2227V\u02dc ) .\nIf \u03b6he = \u03b6db = 0 then \u03b6de = \u00b20 \u00b2 and \u03b6\nhb = (\u00b50\u00b5)\n\u22121. However, for such\nmaterials one cannot assert that \u03b6he, \u03b6db remain zero in all frames. Materials\nwith the general constitutive relation (5) are often referred to as magneto-\nelectric [23], [24].\nMaxwell\u2019s equations (1) in a medium in spacetime M , with j = 0, follow\nnaturally as a local extremum of the action functional S[A, g] =\n\u222b\nM\n\u039b under\nA variations, where locally F = dA, G = Z(F ), and\nc\u039b = 1\n2\nF \u2227 ?G = 1\n2\nF \u2227 ?Z(F )\n5\nprovided the 4\u2212th rank tensor Z is taken to be self-adjoint: Zabcd = Zcdab.\nThe dependence of this action on the metric resides in the ? map and\nZ. Thus the form of the variational derivative of this action under metric\nperturbations will depend on the response of the constitutive tensor Z to\ngravitation. The above form of the constitutive relations relating electric\nand magnetic fields in an arbitrary timelike frame yields a natural tensor\nrelation between Z and V\u02dc \u2261 g(V,\u2212) and so offers a natural dependence\nof Z on g for inhomogeneous, anisotropic (non-dispersive) magneto-electric\ncontinua.\nFor such a Z one may compute by a metric variation of the above action\nthe stress-energy-momentum tensor associated with the electromagnetic field\nin such a medium. After a non-trivial calculation one obtains:\nT = 1\n2\n(\niaF \u2297 iaG+ iaG\u2297 iaF \u2212 ?(F \u2227 ?G)g + V\u02dc \u2297 s+ s\u2297 V\u02dc\n)\n(6)\nwhere the 1-form s = ?\n(\niV F \u2227 iV ?G \u2227 V\u02dc + iV ?F \u2227 iVG \u2227 V\u02dc\n)\n.\nThis reduces in gravity-free Minkowski spacetime to the tensor attributed\nhistorically to Abraham. The details of the derivation in the considerably\nwider context outlined above may be consulted in [25]. In terms of comoving\nfields, defined by (2), (3) with U = V , (6) may be written in the manifestly\nsymmetric form:\nT =\u2212 1\n2\n(e\u2297 d+ d\u2297 e)\u2212 1\n2\n(h\u2297 b+ b\u2297 h)\n+ 1\n2\n(g(e\u02dc, d\u02dc) + g(h\u02dc, b\u02dc))(g + 2V\u02dc \u2297 V\u02dc ) + (V\u02dc \u2297 S\u02dc + S\u02dc \u2297 V\u02dc )\nwhere the Poynting 1-form S\u02dc = ?(V\u02dc \u2227 e \u2227 h).\nIf, by contrast Z is chosen to be totally independent of the metric and\nhence V\u02dc , the resulting stress-energy-momentum tensor becomes\nT = 1\n2\niaG\u2297 iaF + 12iaF \u2297 iaG\u2212 12 ? (F \u2227 ?G)g\nshowing clearly its independence of the 4-velocity V of the medium. In the\nabsence of gravity such a tensor reduces to that obtained by symmetrising\nthe one proposed by Minkowski.\n3 Conclusion\nThere has been a rapid development in recent years in the construction of\n\u201ctraps\u201d for confining collective states of matter on scales intermediate be-\n6\ntween macro- and micro-dimensions. Condensates of cold atoms and fab-\nricated nano-structures offer many new avenues for technological develop-\nment when coupled to probes by electromagnetic fields. The constitutive\nproperties of such novel material will play an important role in this devel-\nopment. Space science is also progressing rapidly and can provide new labo-\nratory environments with variable gravitation and controlled acceleration in\nwhich the properties of such states of matter may be explored. Our results\noffer a new and efficient way to establish a coherent understanding of the\nstresses and energy-momentum exchanges induced by electromagnetic inter-\nactions with such matter in terms of a fully relativistic covariant variational\nframework. Supplemented with additional data based on mechanical and\nelasto-dynamic responses one thereby gains a more confident picture of a to-\ntal phenomenological symmetric stress-energy-momentum tensor for a wide\nclass of moving media than that based on previous ad-hoc choices.\nAcknowledgements The authors are grateful D.
