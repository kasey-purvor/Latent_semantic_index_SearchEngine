As a \nbasis for our analysis, we assume that distinctions may be drawn is the way that \nentities are conceptualised in the analysis, what we refer to as the process of \n\u201centification\u201d. From this point of departure we explore four different process views, \nnamely: process as flows, process as programmes, process as recursive reproduction \nand process as connectivity. The first two views; process as flows and process as \nprogrammes tend to build on the assumption that the processes take place within \nrelatively stable entified contexts, such as the organization or the institutional \nenvironment. This we refer to as an \u201cexogenous\u201d view. A second set of views of \nprocess is what we refer to as \u201cendogenous\u201d views. These two views are what we call \nendogenous, as they assume that entification resides in the process itself. \n \nOrganization as process \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nRecent writings in organization studies suggest that the implications of process \nthinking are substantial and that they recast central notions of organizational change \nand stability. It is timely, however, to look more closely at what distinguishes process \napproaches in the study of organization. The paper shows that views vary \nconsiderably. As a basis for our analysis, we assume that distinctions may be drawn is \nthe way that entities are conceptualised in the analysis, what we refer to as the \nprocess of \u201centification\u201d. From this point of departure we explore four different \nprocess views in organization theory, namely: process as flows, process as \nprogrammes, process as recursive reproduction and process as connectivity. Each of \nthese views reflects a different way of placing the locus of entification in relation to \nprocesses. The first two views; process as flows and process as programmes tend to \nbuild on the assumption that the processes take place within relatively stable entified \ncontexts, such as the organization or the institutional environment. This we refer to as \nan \u201cexogenous\u201d view. A second set of views of process is what we refer to as \n\u201cendogenous\u201d views. These two views are what we call endogenous, as they assume \nthat entification resides in the process itself. In our conclusion, we question whether \nthe two types of views are not reducible to one another; that they are analytically \nirreconcilable approaches. \nThe roots of process thinking go back to Greek and Roman philosophers and have \nbeen pursued in different ways by modern philosophers (e.g. Whitehead, 1929; \nBergson, 1988; James, 1996) writers in sociology (e.g. Luhmann, 1995; Elias, 1970), \nscience and technology studies (e.g. Latour, 1987, 1995), and organization (e.g. \nCooper, 1976; Weick, 1979; Chia, 1999; Tsoukas and Chia, 2002; Law, 1994, 2004; \nStyhre, 2004). Process thinking has always been subjected to differences in \ninterpretation, which can be traced in social science and organization studies. In the \nearly Greek philosophers\u2019 arguments over nature and reality there is a split between \nthe idea of the world as flow and as substance. Heraclites, subscribing to the world as \nconsisting of basic substances (air, water, earth and fire), argued that nothing really \never stays the same. Parmenides on the other hand, insisted upon the permanent and \nunchangeable nature of things. This sort of dichotomy has been a feature of \nOrganization as process \n 3 \nphilosophical debate. In organization studies, Chia (1999), for example, suggests that \never since, the history of Western thought has, therefore, been little more than a \ncontinuing series of footnote attempts at synthesizing these two great but apparently \nirreconcilable intellectual traditions, where one constitutes an \u201centitative\u201d conception \nof reality, and the other emphasizing an inclusively processual view. In a similar vein, \nVan de Ven and Poole (2005) draw a distinction between Heraclites\u2019 and Parminides\u2019 \nviews. Van de Ven and Poole in particular draw a parallel between such distinctions \nin philosophy and perspectives in organization theory, suggesting that Heraclit \nreflects a \u201cprocess view\u201d and Parmenides a \u201cvariance view\u201d.  \nSuch distinctions, we argue, may serve as backdrops to philosophical debates about \nthe nature of things. However, such distinctions tend to be too coarse to be of much \nhelp to organization studies. A field such as organization studies, leaves a number of \noptions open for how process is conceptualised. It offers \u2013 indeed obliges \u2013 choices to \nbe made about what to consider the very objects of process. Put simply, what we \nconsider as entity and what we consider as flow. This paper aims to develop some \ntypes of processes thinking relevant to organization studies, and suggests a mapping \nserving as a preliminary typology.  \nAlthough a number of works debate the nature of process views and their \nimplications for organization and management theory (i.e. Pettigrew, 1987, 1997; \nWeick, 1979; Chia, 1999; Tsoukas and Chia, 2002; Van de Ven and Poole, 2005; \nBakken and Hernes, 2006), there is often not a clear distinction between the different \nunderstandings of process. With some exceptions (e.g. Tsoukas and Chia, 2002; Van \nde Ven and Poole, 2005; Hernes, 2007) the word \u201cprocess\u201d is used merely to \nunderline that movement is taken into consideration. Sometimes a processual twist is \nperformed merely verbally, such as by replacing strategy with \u201cstrategizing\u201d, drawing \ninspiration from Weick\u2019s urge to replace organization with organizing. Such attempts \nserve to sensitize readers to the idea that nothing ever really stays the same. However, \nadding\u201d-ing\u201d to a noun, as much as it turns it into a verb in linguistic terms, does not \ndo much to the ways that we actually conceptualize process and how we formulate all \nthe important questions that come with that conceptualization.  \nA review of works of process writers would suggest that a decisive question for \nanalysis would relate to how stability of entities is treated in the analysis. Weick \nOrganization as process \n 4 \n(1979) delivered an early attack at the assumption of organizations as noun like \nentities. Weick\u2019s argument was that we are better off replacing nouns with verbs, \nreplacing the noun \u201corganization\u201d with the verb \u201corganizing\u201d. As useful as Weick\u2019s \nargument was then, a separation between process and entity upholds dichotomy rather \nthan contribute towards nuancing (Bakken and Hernes, 2006). We have pointed \nbriefly above to the polarization of views inherited from the debate between Greek \nphilosophers. It is time, however, to substantiate types of \u201centification\u201d that apply to \ndifferent forms of organizational analysis. By \u201centification\u201d we mean the extent to \nwhich something is seen to exist in itself, independently of its relations with others. \nAn entity is not to be taken as analogous to a physical object, although it may also be \na physical object. An entity is something that is delimited and recognised as \nsomething that can be talked about, such as a concept, a company, a technology, a \nperson or a group of people. \nAs mentioned above, we do not think that the process versus entity distinction, \nalthough it is justifiable as a philosophical backdrop of analysis, is sufficiently fine \ngrained for interpreting the process aspect of organizational analysis. There is no \n\u201cnatural\u201d split between process and entity. What we tend to consider entities, such as \nhumans, artefacts, technologies and organizations, may be seen to become what they \n\u201care\u201d through processes. Human actors in organizations may well be considered to be \nin the process of becoming something else than what they are at present. Czarniawska \n(1997, 2004), for example, makes the point that there must be something that \nprecedes the making of actors, and that is actions. In other words, actors, to the extent \nthat they are seen as entities, become \u201centified\u201d though the actions they perform, \nwhich confers identity upon them. Hence, entification is a matter of degree and type \nrather than an absolute state. Rather than ask whether something is process or entity, \nthe question to ask is what is allowed to change, and what is considered stable? Once \nwe consider any \u201cthing\u201d in the analysis, \u201cits\u201d change may be considered possible to a \nsmaller or lesser degree. To take an example, if we wish to analyse the process of a \nmanager taking over an organizational unit, it may be necessary to ask the question \nwhether the manager \u201cis\u201d is the same after having worked with the materials as (s)he \nwas at the beginning. He or she may enter the unit with ideas and plans for change, \nOrganization as process \n 5 \nbut as (s)he performs her (his) role as manager, the unit (and the surrounding \norganization) will have affected the manager in turn.  \nIn this paper we suggest that a significant distinction resides in the difference \nbetween an exogenous and an endogenous view of process. According to an \nexogenous view, processes are framed by factors exogenous to them, such as for \nexample organizational boundaries. By implication, processes can be interpreted in \nrelation to something stable and external to them. The locus of entification of an \nexogenous view lies in the context external to the process. According to an \nendogenous view, on the other hand, processes are interpreted in relation to \nthemselves, as external, stable, factors are not assumed to frame the process \nAccording to the latter view, that which becomes the subject of entification resides in \nthe process itself, and not to entities in the external environment.  \n \nAn exogenous view of process \n \nAn exogenous view of process suggests that the process, i.e. that which moves, is \ninterpreted in relation to something outside the process, what we might call the \ncontext for the process. For example, when processes are identified within an \norganization the processes themselves account for anticipated movement within the \norganization\u2019s boundaries. From this perspective, the organization forms the context, \ninside which the movement takes place. The actual patterns of movement reflect what \nthe identity of the organization can be said to be, such as, for example bureaucratic \norganizations being traditionally associated with rule-based behaviour, formal plans \nand relatively little movement of people across functional borders. What then \nconstitutes organizational change, is change in the internal patterns of flows or \nprogrammes. If, for example, informal communication takes over from formal \ncommunication, one could say that the organization has changed towards a more \ninformal culture of communication. This is typically the view taken by Pettigrew \n(1987) and Pettigrew, Woodman and Cameron (2001:700): \n \nOrganization as process \n 6 \n \u201cIf the change process is the stream of analysis, the terrain around the stream that \nshapes the field of events, and is in turn shaped by them, is a necessary part of the \ninvestigation.\u201d  \n \nIn this quote, they refer to the \u201cterrain\u201d rather than the context, the terrain being that \nwhich surrounds the stream. Analytically, this means that if we allow the process to \nchange, the organization surrounding the process is assumed to stay pretty much the \nsame.  If we were to allow the terrain (or, for example, the boundaries) to change, \nthere would be little against which to make sense of the process. \nA number of different schools in organization and management theory operate with \ncontext as the determining factor for processes. An exogenous view is central to \nimportant schools in organization theory over the last few decades, such as \norganizational ecology (Hannan and Freeman, 1989), new institutionalism (DiMaggio \nand Powell, 1983, 1991), resource dependence theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), \nevolutionary organization theory (Aldrich, 1999) and economic sociology and \nbusiness systems (Morgan, Whitley and Moen, 2005). The main thinking behind \nthese schools is that the character of processes within organizational boundaries are \nthe way they are because they respond to factors in the external environment of the \norganization. Processes fit in with their external environments, such as by adopting \nstructures that are deemed legitimate and timely, which is a tenet of new institutional \ntheory. This is why in new institutionalism, for example, forces such as imitation and \ncoercion are seen as strong influences in the adoption of management ideas. The \nsources of both imitation and coercion are located outside the organization. For those \nwho are less interested in the symbolic side of adaptation, and more interested in \neconomic performance, external criteria, such as competition and regulation replace \nthe influence of norms and needs for legitimacy. There is a huge literature on \nbusiness performance that aims to understand how competition works as a \nmechanism of selection on the basis of performance. There are similar examples in \nsome of the management theory, such as where the adoption of certain management \nstyles are seen to correlate successfully with certain types of problems. \nIn what follows we distinguish two view that we see as typically exogenous in \norganization studies. The first \u2013 process as flows \u2013 represents a broad range of flows \nOrganization as process \n 7 \nthat may take place within organizational boundaries. In a sense, process as flows \nincludes any, flow, intended or unintended, physical or human that makes up the \norganization. Process as programmes \u2013 the second type of process \u2013 consists of \nregularized chains of actions designed intentionally to solve problems facing the \norganization. Because programmes are intentional they make up what is commonly \nreferred to as the formal part of an organization.  \n \nExogenous view 1: Process as flows  \n \nIn organization and management studies process tends to be taken as a general term \ndescribing anything that flows as opposed to remaining static. Flows of labour, \noperations, transactions, materials and information have been studied as processes \nsince before Weber\u2019s time, which is a date that is taken by several writers as the \ngenesis of organization theory. Take, for example, the following extract from Adam \nSmith\u2019s ([1776]1986:110) Wealth of nations, written a century before Weber: \n \n\u201cOne man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a \nfifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires three \ndistinctive operations; to put it on is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is \nanother; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important \nbusiness of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct \noperations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, \nthough in others the same man will perform two or three of them.\u201d \n \nIf counted in their smallest units, the amount of flows is potentially infinite in any \ngiven organization. In an average sized company or public administration, for \nexample, thousands of emails may be composed, sent, received, opened, read and \nacted on every day. Flows are not associated with physical entities alone. Weick\u2019s \n(1995) review of the sensemaking literature, for example, suggests how flows of \nimpressions, interpretations and enactment constitute the day to day life in \norganizations:  \n \nOrganization as process \n 8 \n\u201cThe processes themselves are also streams. They are social, and they involve \nmultiple actors. The outcomes of organizing are reasonable interpretations of a slice \nof experience; these slices are treated as being amenable as well as prescriptive for \nfuture activities. Thus processes are assembled from flows, directed at flows, and \nsummarize flows\u201d. (Weick, 1979:47) \n \nAlthough the number and variations between flows are substantial, there are \ninevitably features of the flows that are fairly coherent, and the features of the flows \nin an organization serve to distinguish it from other organizations.  \nFlows are largely assumed to constitute the \u201cfluid stuff\u201d that relates to the functioning \nof the organization, implying that organizations serve to form contexts, or spaces, \n(Hernes, 2004) within which flows take place. Hence, most studies regard flows as \nbeing contextualized by the organization, where the form of the organization \ninfluences the type of flows that takes place. In their study, Burns and Stalker (1961), \nfor example distinguished between so-called \u201cmechanistic\u201d organizations relying \nmore on formal communication and \u201corganic\u201d organizations where informal \ncommunication was more of the order of the day. Thus, dominant or recurring \nfeatures of the flows that exist in an organization confer identity upon that particular \norganization. When processes are studied as flows, it is assumed that their context \nrepresents a relatively entity against which the flows are interpreted. For example, a \nhigh degree of market orientation of organization\u2019s internal communication may be \nheld up against a number of different characteristics of the external environment, \nsuch as choosy and conscientious customers. In this case, entification lies with \ncustomers, who are perceived as entities with certain attributes, such as choosy or \nconscientious. \nAnalysis of flow normally assumes a locus of entification beyond the level of the \nflow, which is the context for the flow. The context tends to be considered a different \nlevel from the flow, such as a department, for example, being seen as the context for \nthe behaviour of staff belonging to that department. In this case, the entity is the \ndepartment, with its \u201cbox\u201d on the organizational chart, with the diverse flows going \non within it or across the borders with other departments. The \u201cbox\u201d, however, \nbelongs at a different level of analysis from the actual flows. Analytically this implies \nOrganization as process \n 9 \nthat the two (the flows and the department) are considered at separate level, where the \ncontext influences what goes on. However, the reverse is not equally true, which \nmans that flows are not considered to impact on the department level. An implication \nis that the context for flows is entified, and thus little sensitive to being influenced by \nthe flows.  \n \nExogenous view 2: Process as programmes.  \n \nProgrammes constitute the more formalized patterns of organizational problem \nsolving that serve to distinguish one organization from another. Whereas flows, as \ndiscussed above, may be associated with a broad range of things, including \ntechnologies, humans or sensemaking; programmes entail programmed activity. In \ntheir pioneering work, March and Simon (1958) evoked the idea of programmes, \nwhich they saw as constitutive of formal organizations. March and Simon (1958) \ndrew a distinction between procedural and substantive programmes, where procedural \nprogrammes aim at the structure of the problem solving process while substantive \nprogrammes are aimed at the structure of the problem itself. Essentially, programmes, \nwhether procedural or substantive, are structured sets of activities. They perform \naccording to some predefined structure in order to solve problems. In other words, \nthey are formed in anticipation, either to solve problems that exist or problems that \nmay arise.  \nProgrammes constitute largely what is commonly referred to as formal organization. \nProgrammes serve both to uphold formal organizations in stable states as well as \nchanging them. Programmes are processes in the sense that they consist of \nprogrammed connected bits and pieces of actions that connect logically, based on \nsome idea about how the organization should stabilise or change. They represent \nformal organization because they are formalized in the way of being tangible sets of \nactivities belonging exclusively to the organization in question, defined mainly by \norganization leaders. Hence, programmes are constitutive of \u201cformal\u201d identity of the \norganization, while at the same time serving as problem solving mechanisms. This \ndouble feature of programmes is illustrated in Hernes and Schjelderup\u2019s (2005) study \nof a Norwegian dairy co-operative. The co-operative is owned by dairy farmers, who \nOrganization as process \n 10 \nexercise their ownership through votation at an annual meeting gathering hundreds of \nfarmer representatives. The annual meeting is clearly a \u201cprogramme\u201d, being a set of \nprogrammed sets of actions, which is part and parcel of the co-operative\u2019s decision \nmaking processes. The farmers vote on strategic issues that are of relevance to their \nlevel of ownership. At the same time, the event is an important identity creating \nritual, reinforcing the idea of cooperative ownership. \nExamples of programmes aimed at organizational change are found in studies of \nreform in the public sector (e.g. Brunsson and Olsen, 1990), which is launched in the \nform of programmes with the aim of changing organizational arrangements away \nfrom status quo and towards some predefined set of goals. Reform programmes are \nunique sets of activities that are launched to solve non-standard problems. Another \ntype of programme is routines (Feldman, 2000), which are generalized programmes \nto deal with standard problems. For example, routines for hiring and firing people are \nestablished because these are problems that are recurrent for organizations. \nVarious works illustrate how programmes arise and are adopted as practices in \norganizational fields (Dimaggio and Powell, 1983), which means that they become \nconstitutive of organizational identity on the particular fields of which they form part. \nFeldman and Pentland (2005), for example, suggest how organizations actually come \nto evolve around routines that are distinct for a field of organizations, how they in \nfact become the building blocks of both organizations and organizational fields. The \nadoption of certain programmes, such as routines, relies on the search of for a \ncollective identity, hence, the need for legitimacy. Behind much thinking about \nprogrammes thus lies the assumption that they arise out of the demands from a \ncontext that lies outside the program, either as a way of rationalizing activities or as \nway to build organizational identity. \nIt should be noted that although programmes may be considered to be rooted in \nlogical coherence, that does not imply that the consequences of implementing \nprogrammes are consistent with expectations. In fact, as shown in the reform \nliterature (e.g. Brunsson and Olsen, 1990), intended programmes may not even be \nimplemented as planned. Although programmes may arise from a coherent set of \nideas and aimed at preserving stability, they may sometimes lead to the opposite, \nsimilar to what Merton (1936) referred to as the unintended consequences of \nOrganization as process \n 11 \npurposive social action. This does not undermine the character of formal \norganizations, since, in the words of March (1981) they are essentially incoherent \nsystems operating in an incoherent world.  \nThe coherence that March alludes to, may be found in the entification of \nprogrammes. Programmes take on labels, such as for example \u201cTotal quality\u201d, or \n\u201cProcess re-engineering\u201d, which allows them to be talked about and implemented as \npackages of internally coherent sets of actions, each \u201cpackage\u201d bearing promise of a \ndifferent impact on the organization. Much the same goes for routines, which, once \nthey are recognized as exhibiting some uniqueness, can be adopted by organizations \nelsewhere. The naming of programmes under labels confers upon them an entitative \nstatus, because it is the entitative status which makes them recognisable. Entitative \nstatus also makes programmes available for assessment and evaluation, something \nwhich enables them to be analysed from the perspective of cause and effect. It is \nwithin a logic of cause and effect that studies of reform programmes, for example, \nhave been conceived, which allows writers such as Brunsson (2005) and Brunsson \nand Olsen (1989) to question the success of many reform programmes, particularly in \nthe public sector. A similar logic can be seen in writings on routines, where Feldman \n(2000), for example, suggests conditions under which routines may lead to \norganizational change. Feldman points out three reasons why routines change through \nemergent processes. One reason is that unintended outcomes are produced. Another \nreason is that new problems arise that need to be solved. A third reason is that new \nresources are produced, creating new opportunities. An example of the latter is when \nnew knowledge is produced, enabling innovation of new products or procedures. It is \nnotable that in each of the three cases, change is related to what the routine is \nexpected or not expected to accomplish. Hence, the routine is considered a package \nthat can be held up against the effects it has on problem solving. \nWhether we are talking about programmes of reform or routines, they are both \nentifications of processes. Programmes and routines contain actions, which constitute \nthe actual process. When programs or routines are abstracted from their contexts, they \nare done so by virtue of labels bearing promise of certain qualities. Thus the \nprocesses of actions are subsumed under entified labels. When programs or routines \nare transpoert to other contexts, they are adopted on the basis of comparison with \nOrganization as process \n 12 \nstable characteristics of their \u201cnew\u201d context, such as organizational goals, vision, \nstructure and resources. \n \nAn endogenous view of process \n \nIn the case of an exogenous view, the basis from which analysis is carried out, is the \nouter context, the outer limits that we assume to frame the processes and to give them \ntheir form. Exogenous factors tend to support processes, give them a \u201chome\u201d so to \nspeak. If exogenous factors are not taken as a basis, however, the \u201cbasis\u201d of analysis \nresides in the process itself; the process becomes its own rationale, so to speak. In the \nabsence of exogenous factors, the process interacts with itself, with its past which is \ncarried forward into a relatively stable basis for further processes. The shift of focus \nfrom the exogenous is decisive for analysis, both for carrying out the analysis and for \nthe type of arguments resulting from the analysis. \nWeick\u2019s (1979) early work is an example of how a clear distinction may be drawn \nbetween exogenous and endogenous analysis. Weick is well known for introducing \nthe learning loop of enactment \u2013 selection \u2013 retention. The model was inspired by \nCampbell\u2019s (1969) variation-selection-retention model of sociocultural evolution \n(note the difference).  Campbell\u2019s work, however, assumed exogenous selection in \nevolution, meaning that systems were \u201cselected\u201d by their external environments. \nWeick, on the other hand, replaced Campbell\u2019s \u2018variation\u2019 with \u2018enactment\u2019 to \nemphasize the active role organizational members play in creating, defining, giving \nmeaning to, and influencing their environments. Weick\u2019s departure is highly \nsignificant largely because it shift focus from how a state of organization correlates \nwith its context to focus on how a state of organization actually comes about through \nprocesses of enactment. These processes of enactment come from within the \norganization rather than from the outside.  \n \nEndogenous view 1: Process as connectivity \n \nFrom the perspective of process philosophy Whitehead (1938:9) held that \n\u201cconnectedness is of the essence of all things of all kinds\u201d. Connectedness implies \nOrganization as process \n 13 \nbasically the readiness for various heterogeneous elements to interact and thus create \na coherent whole. It has been discussed how an exogenous view treats organizations \nor environments as contexts for interaction. A different view is pursued by an \nemerging group of theorists, who seek to transcend limits of organizational theorizing \nby seeing organization as the process of connecting of heterogeneous elements. Their \nconceptualization shows how organizations unfold from a more eclectic basis of \nfactors, such as artefacts, technologies, human and institutional actors. Czarniawska \n(2004) uses the word \u201dconnection\u201d  suggesting that connecting is the central activity \nin organizing processes. Chia (2003) presents an argument for organizing as \u201cworld-\nmaking\u201d. By world-making he means how organizing involves combining \nheterogeneous factors that all work to stabilize actions in time-space. Law (1994) \nmakes a similar point in seeing organization as the heterogeneous mix of materials, \ntechnologies, texts and humans gathered into an entity, the formal organisation. In \nLaw\u2019s terms a \u2018pure\u2019 social organisation would not last very long; it is through \nbuilding a network of heterogeneous elements an object comes to be more or less \nstable. Such conceptualizations are powerful for understanding how different \nelements interact \u2013 or are made to interact \u2013 thus forming a stabilizing configuration.  \nLatour\u2019s (1987) work in Actor-Network Theory is particularly instructive for \nunderstanding how connecting processes unfold. Latour refers to actions such as \nenrolment, inscription, translation and mobilization, which are actions undertaken by \nsome actors in order to secure the participation of other actors in the network. Actors, \nwhich Latour partly replaces with the term \u201cactants\u201d to emphasize the active role \nplayed by nonhuman as well as human actors, are constantly at work to add or \nremove other actors\/actants to the network, thereby improving the chances of \nsurvival. Latour, whose work is draws some inspiration from Whitehead (1929), \nillustrates how his analytical framework works in explaining developments such as \nthe Diesel engine and the Kodak camera.  \nConnectivity implies a relational way of understanding organization, where the nature \nof the connecting elements is not limited to the social, nor is it limited to the physical. \nAn overriding principle is that of heterogeneity (Law, 1994), where elements from \nthe social and the physical interact to produce and reproduce their connections. \nConnectivity is thus a process view that permits understanding of how various \nOrganization as process \n 14 \nelements relate, and how their relating turns into network. The network feeds mainly \non its own process of connecting. As some elements change or new elements enter, \nthe configuration changes, which means that relations between other elements \nchange. In this way, the configuration undergoes recurring processes of connecting \nand reconnecting.  \nAnother principle, related to that of heterogeneity, is that of symmetry. For example, \ntechnology is related to human in such a way that it takes part in shaping human \nactors as participants in the organization, as much as human actors shape technology. \nMachines, for example, are not just considered machines in a technical sense, but also \nas elements that take part in shaping the elements \u2013 human and non-human \u2013 that are \nassociated with the machines. Lindahl (2005:62), for example, who studied the \neffects of a company manufacturing and installing a 250 tonne machine, made the \nfollowing observation: \n \n\u201c[\u2026] the engine as a tool or a component in a rational construction process has to \nbe replaced with a more totemistic image. The engine is not only a component among \nother components, although bigger, heavier and more complex. It carries the raison \nd\u2019\u00eatre of the company and of its employees. In this company, in this context, the \nengine makes the people engineers.\u201c \n \nThe machine is perceived as an entity, just as people in contact with it are perceived \nas entities. What makes this an endogenous process view, however, is firstly that \nfocus is on the relating as much as on entities, whereby the machine is seen to take \npart in shaping human actors connected to it. The analysis is directed toward how \nrelations serve to co-create the entities that are related. Second, the characteristics of \nthe entities are open, because the entities are in the making. What we \u201csee\u201d are labels, \nsuch as actor, machines or artefacts, whereas their \u201ccontent\u201d is forever open to \ndefinition and modification. \nConnectivity, of which Actor-network theory is an example, is by all intents and \npurposes an endogenous view because the process resides in the connections that are \nOrganization as process \n 15 \nformed and reformed1\n \n. Entification lies with connecting entities which are not \nassumed to take a final form, but, as pointed out above, are mere \u201copen\u201d entities, \nready to take one changing characteristics as their relations change. A different level \nof entification takes place as certain constellations of entities take on names or labels \nmay turn into \u201cmacro-actors\u201d, or \u201cblack boxes\u201d (Latour, 1999). In much the same \nway that Czarniawska (1997; 2004), in her discussion of action nets, sees action nets \nas creating actors, the connecting gives shape to entities. \nEndogenous view 2: Process as recursive reproduction \n \nOrganization may alternatively be seen as temporarily structured a state that is \nconstantly in processes of construction and reconstruction, for which Feldman (2000) \nappropriately uses the term \u201congoing accomplishments\u201d. Feldman uses the expression \nto point out how seemingly stabilised states are the result of painstaking processes \nwith uncertain outcomes. The perspective of organization as engaging in a process of \nrecursive reproduction owes much to works in sociology, notably by Giddens and \nLuhmann. Giddens developed his structuration theory on the basis that social systems \nexist through their continuous structuration in the course of time (Giddens, \n1979:217). His structuration theory has influenced a number of works in organization \ntheory (e.g. Bartunek, 1984; Ranson, Hinings and Greenwood 1980; Barley and \nTolbert, 1997; Orlikowski and Yates, 2002). Giddens drew upon the work of \nBourdieu, and his notion of habitus in particular. Bourdieu\u2019s conceptualization of \nhabitus was as a generative principle, which lies at the basis of practices, but which is \nmodified by those practices in turn. The principle, or habitus, is open to modification, \nbut it is stable enough to serve as a basis for practices  (Bourdieu, 1977). In a sense, \nhabitus, although it is constantly under revision, is stable to the extent that it may be \nascribed sets of characteristics. In a somewhat similar way, Giddens works from the \nidea of systems engaging in continuous structuration, where systems have structures, \nwhich are being modified through processes of structuration. Structures are semi \nstable stabilizing arrangements serving as bases of structuration. \n                                                 \n1 The external environment exists, but as a reservoir from which elements and \nrelations are created, and not as a neutral, constant, determining factor. \nOrganization as process \n 16 \nThe relationship between structure and process is a recursive relationship, whereby \nthey both take part in their mutual production. As mentioned above, Giddens (1979, \n1984) points out the recursive character of social life, with structure being both the \nmedium and the outcome of social practices. In other words, social practices take \nplace due to structure, but they tend to reproduce or modify the structure in turn. This \nis what happens with events as well, in the sense that they take place within a \nstructure, while also reproducing and modifying it.  \nA sociologist and organization writer who has given exclusive attention to the idea of \nrecursive reproduction, is Niklas Luhmann (1995, 2000), whose autopoietic social \nsystems theory is increasingly being drawn upon in organization and management \nstudies (e.g. Bakken and Hernes, 2003; Seidl, 2005; Seidl and Becker, 2006). \nLuhmann works from an analytical distinction between structure and process \ninteracting recursively with one another. Structure without process becomes a shell, \njust as process without structure becomes action without direction. This is why \nLuhmann does not treat process as isolated from structure, but considers structure and \nprocess as complementary terms (Luhmann 2000:340). For example, in the case of \nbudgeting, the budget may be seen as structure, in the sense that budgets serve to bind \nactivities in time and space. The binding provided by budgets cannot exist \nindependently of the activities they bind, otherwise there could be no feedback into \nthe budgeting processes. Therefore, in the absence of activity there is nothing to \ninform the budget, hence budget as a structure would not be able to reproduce itself.  \nWhen process is viewed as recursive reproduction, the locus of entification resides \nwith the structure, which may be seen as a temporary arrangement being produced by \nprocesses, on which processes feed in turn. Structures, if they are to act as bases for \nprocesses, need to exhibit some recognisability, which they sometimes do in the form \nof mechanisms, such as rules, budgets, plans or technology. \nA common feature of studies, whether influenced by Giddens\u2019 structuration theory or \nby Luhmann\u2019s social systems theory, is a focus on the time dimension. Reproduction \ntakes place with reference to past history, which is embedded in present structure. A \nrecursive perspective of organization is thus in many ways a process perspective \nwhereby a temporarily entified form of organization forms a basis for organizing \nprocesses. Current states of organization embodies the history of the past; events, \nOrganization as process \n 17 \nexperiences and structures that are inscribed into the present. The present state of \norganization forms a basis from which organizing processes are projected into the \nfuture. The present state does not influence the future in a determinist way, but works \nas a contingency, in the sense that it forms a horizon against which processes of \norganization are undertaken. \n \nConcluding notes \n \nThe four interpretations of process discussed above and shown in table 1 below, do \nnot represent the whole panoply of process perspectives in organization studies. They \ndo, however, represent distinct \u201cpoles\u201d around which much process thinking seems to \ngravitate.  \nThe discussion of the four types of views shown scematically in table 1, suggests how \nthe locus and the nature of entification differs between them. It suggests moreover \nthat differences in locus of entification are considerable between the views. \nDifferences between exogenous and endogenous view are particularly important. \nExogenous views emphasize context, which is a spatial visualization of processes. \nAccording to en exogenous view, flows or programmes consist of actions framed by \norganizational contexts. Endogenous views, on the other hand, lend more emphasis to \ntime, in the sense that entification takes place over time rather than space. In the case \nof connectivity, the process of relating creates entities over time, influencing the \nrelations in turn. Process as recursive reproduction is perhaps even more time based, \nin the sense that structured states are assumed to embody the history, forming a basis \nfor processes to come. \nIf this typification is accepted, it suggests that the question of locus of entification \ndemands great care when performing organizational analysis. The typification \nsuggests that it matters a lot whether, for example, process is assumed to be framed \nby an external context or whether the process is considered to be the forming of \nentities. An advantage of working with such a typification as a backdrop for analysis \nis that it may help analytic consistency to be upheld. It is open to question whether \ndifferent views are reconcilable with one another in the sense that different view may \nbe taken in the same analysis. \nOrganization as process \n 18 \nOur paper started with a critique of the simple distinction between process and entity \nsuggested by Van de Ven and Poole (2005). We think that the typification presented \nin this paper is a more nuanced distinction, and one that is better suited for \norganizational analysis. Still, what we have presented here remains coarse, and could \nbenefit from further development and refinement.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nExogenous \nviews  \nProcess as flows Criss-crossing flows of multiple types. \nConstitute the particularity and identity of the \norganization. Entification taking place in what \nis considered the \u201ccontext\u201d for the flows. \n  \nProcess as \nprogrammes \nAs formalized organizational problem solving \nprocesses, they are constitutive of formal \norganizations. Entification takes place, either \nas programmes are correlated with factors in \nthe external environment, or they become \nstandardised and categorized under labels, \nallowing them to travel. \n \n \n \n \nEndogenous \nviews \n \n \n \nProcess as \nconnectivity \nA relational way of seeing organization, where \norganization is seen as the unfolding of \nrelations between heterogeneous elements. \nEntification lies with the connecting elements. \nProcess as \nrecursive \nreproduction \nOrganization seen as unfolding through \nreproduction around a relatively stable \nevolving structure. Entification lies with semi \nstable structures recursively implicated with \nprocesses. \nTable 1.
