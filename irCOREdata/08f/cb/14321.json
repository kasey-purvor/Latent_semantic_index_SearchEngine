At the Open University we have many years of\nexperience of helping learners to use such simulations in physics teaching, and evaluating\nthe results (see, for example, Every and Scanlon, 1984). We present here an account of an\nattempt to use a computer simulation to help beginning students of physics to learn about\nchaos.\n60\nALT-J Volume 5 Number I\nThe Driven Pendulum software\nA driven damped pendulum is a suitable instrument for experimental studies of chaotic\nmotion. Blackburn et al (1989) describe one such instrument consisting of a mechanical\npendulum driven by both steady and alternating torques, together with interface\nelectronics for data logging and graphic displays. The course team for the introductory\nphysics course Discovering Physics decided to use a computer simulation of a similar\nsystem at the residential summer school which offers both laboratory sessions as well as\nproblem-solving and computer-based activities. The students used the driven pendulum\nsimulation as part of a series of short experiments each lasting about three hours. The\ncomputer-simulated experiment was programmed by the Centre for Educational\nSoftware, and the underlying mathematical model produced by the Physics department at\nthe Open University.\nThe main aim of the simulation was that students should observe some of the generic\nfeatures of chaotic motion, and explore ways in which these may be represented\ngraphically. This simulation provided students with a number of learning opportunities,\nfor example the opportunity to build up state-space trajectories for various types of\npendulum motion, in order to appreciate the advantages of the state-space representation\nfor analysing complicated behaviour, and providing consolidation of ideas about\noscillations, damping and resonance. A subsidiary aim was that the inclusion of\nsimulations in the residential school programme could give all students some hands-on\nexperience of computer use.\nThe program\nThe simulation screen consists of three windows (see Figure 1). The first window displays\nthe graphs, and the student has a choice of different displays such as angle as a function\nof time, component of angular velocity as a function of time, and component of angular\nvelocity as a function of angle. The third of these options, called the state-space\nrepresentation, is used extensively in the experiment. The second window is a pendulum\nanimation, and the third window has pendulum parameters. The graphs window and the\npendulum window can be re-sized by students to help them see the details of the motion\nof the pendulum, but most of the students we observed used the sizing shown in Figure 1.\nThe development of the graph can be seen by the students, and the pendulum animation\nalso provides visual information about the motion of the pendulum. Students can specify\nthe parameters (pendulum mass, length, initial angle, initial angular speed, pivot\namplitude, frequency, and experiment duration) and determine how many samples per\ndrive cycle will be used to form the graph, and whether to observe the display in real time\nor in fast processing. The level of damping can be determined by selecting low, medium or\nhigh damping buttons, or students can specify the exact level of damping by turning on\n'Exact damping' in the View menu. An additional pop-up menu provides students with\nfacilities for examining the motion of the pendulum in detail. For example, they can use\nan autoscale facility to change the range of axes of the graph, a default facility to go back\nto original display-range of the axes, the fit damped curve facility to measure decay time\nof the oscillations, and the memorize facility to superimpose the previous graph on the\npresent one.\n61\nBleen Scanhn et ol Simulating chaos: an evaluation of the driven pendulum experiment\ns,-AO\"sxp(-t\/tau)\nM) - 0.0998094 rod\nan - 5.09446 seconds\nS.D. samples \u2022 0.0006051<3\nfigure \/: The three windows of the simulation screen\nThe evaluation\nWe conducted an evaluation of the Driven Pendulum at the residential school in 1995.\nThis involved 38 students (19 pairs). Specially designed questionnaires were given to\nstudents before and after the experiment was administered in order to collect data on the\nstudents' attitude to certain aspects of the simulation, and to collect performance data.\nThirty complete pairs of pre- and post-experiment questionnaires were returned. In\naddition, data collected included video (three pairs) and audio recordings of students at\nwork on the simulation to allow an investigation of how the students interacted with the\nsoftware, and to gain access to the conversations which the pairs had while using the\nsimulation. This approach has been found to be particularly helpful in analysing the\nimpact of educational software on learning outcomes (see, for example, Scanlon et at,\n1993a and 1993b). Individual and group interviews with students and tutors were another\nline of data-collection which provided some insights into the software's contribution to\nstudent learning. This evaluation was conducted as part of a university-wide project run\nby the Computers and Learning Research Group which is investigating computer use in\nlearning science and technology, and developing evaluation methodologies (Jones et al,\n1996). It was both formative in that the evaluation results were used to redesign the notes\nguiding students through the activities, and summative in that we were able to draw some\nconclusions about the role played by the simulation in students' learning.\nThe questionnaire results were reassuring in that only four out of thirty students did not\nfind the experiment notes clear. Twenty-six students reported that the software was\n62\nALT-] Volume 5 Number I\nmotivational. Students were asked what they had learned from the experiment. Nineteen\ndetailed responses were given to this question, all but one of them positive (for example,\n'P learned ] to ask more questions about the relationship between the range of resonance\nfrequencies and the degree of damping, and how continuously varying a parameter can\nmove a system from chaotic to merely complicated behaviour'.) Students were given a list,\nand asked to select their view of the most important advantage of doing this experiment\nin the form of a computer simulation. Half of the students felt the most important\nadvantage was that they would learn more in the same amount of time, and almost the\nsame number (14 out of 3Q students) that it gave better understanding of the material.\nObservations revealed that, as they used the simulation, many of the students were\ninterested in the underlying model, and that they wanted to experiment to see what it was\nlike. Many used the simulation to check the theoretical equations. Both the questionnaire\nresponses and the observation data illustrated that some confusion existed over the\ncritical damping condition when damped pendula were observed, and some of this was\ndue to students using different scales for their observations.\nAll students were also presented with a mini-quiz after they completed the experiment.\nThey were presented with two different types of graphs of five selected parameters. The\nfirst type were angle-versus-time graphs of selected parameters; the second was of state-\nspace trajectories of the same set of parameters. After they finished the experiment, the\nstudents were asked to match angle-versus-time and state-space representations for the\nsame set of parameters. Scores for each item on the mini quiz ranged from 67 per cent to\n88 per cent, giving support for the view we formed from observations and interviews that\nthe experiment was successful in terms of providing help with an understanding of the\nmotion of the pendulum and its representation.\nConclusions\nThe students were extremely positive about the contribution made to their learning by the\nprogram, and there is some evidence that it indeed did help their learning. However, the\nobservation data suggests that many of the students were still unclear about the distinc-\ntion between complex and chaotic behaviour, and many would have liked to spend more\ntime on the experiment. We found the mix of methods of evaluation used provided us\nwith a rich picture of how students had gained from their experience of simulating chaos.\nReferences\nBlackburn, J.A., Vik, S., Wu, B. and Smith, H.J.T.
