After analyzing the features of the optimal cooperative solution, we show\nthat this allocation can be implemented in a strategic context through inflation-targeting\nregimes. Under these regimes, each monetary authority minimizes a quadratic loss\nfunction that targets only domestic targets, namely, GDP inflation and the output gap.\nKeywords: International Monetary Cooperation, Inflation Targeting\nIn this paper, we examine the international monetary policy design problem in a\nsimple two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with imperfect compe-\ntition, nominal price rigidities and producer currency pricing. As discussed in a\nrelated work [Benigno and Benigno (2005)], the structure of the model allows for\ngains from international monetary policy cooperation. The focus in this work is\nto study if it is possible to design institutions that can implement the cooperative\nallocation. In Benigno and Benigno (2005), we have shown how to design targeting\nrules\u2014that is, linear combinations of target variables. Here we study how flexible\ninflation targeting policies [see Svensson (2002)] could be adopted in a framework\nin which policy makers still interact strategically.\nThere are two classes of exogenous disturbances in the model, productivity and\nmarkup shocks. Following markup shocks, we describe two possible transmission\nmechanisms whose operation depends on the values of key structural parameters;\na \u201cpositive-correlated\u201d scenario in which markup shocks generate comovement\nof inflation rates across countries, and a \u201cnegative-correlated\u201d scenario in which\ninflation rates move in opposite directions.\nIn analyzing the implementation of the cooperative allocation, our main finding\nis that is sufficient for this purpose that each policy maker commits to minimize\nAddress correspondence to: Gianluca Benigno, Department of Economics and CEP, London School of Economics,\nHoughton Street, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom; e-mail: g.benigno@lse.ac.uk.\nc\u00a9 2008 Cambridge University Press 1365-1005\/08 $18.00 45\n46 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\na quadratic loss function that appropriately weighs only domestic targets\u2014the\noutput gap and the domestic producer inflation rate. Our model supports the\nadoption of flexible inflation-targeting regimes [see Svensson (2002)], even in an\ninternational context.\nFurthermore, the design of the relative weights in the objective functions of\nthe monetary policy makers depends on the scenario that we consider. Under a\n\u201cpositive-correlated scenario,\u201d it is optimal to design institutions with a relatively\nhigher weight on the domestic output gap in order to correct for the \u201ccontrac-\ntionary bias\u201d that would arise in a strategic framework. By contrast, in the \u201cneg-\native correlated scenario\u201d the corresponding \u201cexpansionary bias\u201d should be cor-\nrected by assigning a higher relative weight to domestic producer inflation in both\ncountries.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 1 presents the model and Section\n2 the log-linear approximation of the structural equilibrium conditions. Section 3\nstudies the cooperative solution. Section 4 shows how to implement the cooperative\nsolution in a decentralized context. Section 5 concludes.\n1. THE MODEL\nIn this section, we present our two-country dynamic general equilibrium model\nwith imperfect competition and nominal price rigidities along the lines of\nBenigno and Benigno (2002, 2005), Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2002), and\nSvensson (2000).\n1.1. Households\u2019 Preferences\nWe consider a two-country economy, Home (H ) and Foreign (F ). The population\non the segment [0, n) belongs to the Home country whereas the one on the segment\n[n, 1] belongs to the Foreign country. Each individual maximizes the following\nutility function:\nU\nj\nt = Et\n{ \u221e\u2211\ns=t\n\u03b2s\u2212t [U(Cjs )\u2212 V (ys(j), \u03beY,s)]\n}\n,\nwhere the index j denotes a variable that is specific to household j ; Et denotes the\nexpectation conditional on the information set at date t , while\u03b2 is the intertemporal\ndiscount factor, with 0 <\u03b2 < 1. Individuals obtain utility from consumption while\nthey receive disutility from producing a single differentiated good, which is subject\nto a country-specific shock, \u03beY , that we interpret as a productivity shock. Country\u2019s\nF variables are denoted with a star index. U is an increasing concave function of\nthe index Cj defined as\nCj \u2261\n[\nn\n1\n\u03b8\n(\nC\nj\nH\n) \u03b8\u22121\n\u03b8 + (1 \u2212 n) 1\u03b8 (CjF ) \u03b8\u22121\u03b8 ] \u03b8\u03b8\u22121 ,\nIMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 47\nwhere CjH and C\nj\nF are consumption subindexes of the continuum of differentiated\ngoods produced, respectively, in country H and F :\nC\nj\nH \u2261\n[(\n1\nn\n) 1\n\u03c3\n\u222b n\no\ncj (h)\n\u03c3\u22121\n\u03c3 dh\n] \u03c3\n\u03c3\u22121\n, C\nj\nF \u2261\n[(\n1\n1 \u2212 n\n) 1\n\u03c3\n\u222b 1\nn\ncj (f )\n\u03c3\u22121\n\u03c3 df\n] \u03c3\n\u03c3\u22121\n,\nwhere \u03c3 > 1 is the elasticity of substitution across goods produced within a country\nand \u03b8 is the elasticity of substitution between the bundles CH and CF ; n is a\nparameter such that 0 \u2264 n\u2264 1.\nP denotes the consumption-based price index associated with C, defined as\nP \u2261 [n(PH )1\u2212\u03b8 + (1 \u2212 n)(PF )1\u2212\u03b8 ] 11\u2212\u03b8 ,\nwith\nPH \u2261\n[(\n1\nn\n)\u222b n\no\np(h)1\u2212\u03c3 dh\n] 1\n1\u2212\u03c3\n, PF \u2261\n[(\n1\n1 \u2212 n\n)\u222b 1\nn\np(f )1\u2212\u03c3 df\n] 1\n1\u2212\u03c3\n,\nwhere p(h) and p(f ) are prices in units of domestic currency of the Home-\nproduced and Foreign-produced goods, respectively.\nAll consumption goods are traded. Prices are set in the currency of the producer\nand the law of one price holds: p(h)= S \u00b7p\u2217(h) and p(f )= S \u00b7p\u2217(f ), where S\nis the nominal exchange rate (the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic\ncurrency). Given these assumptions and the structure of preferences, purchasing\npower parity holds, that is, P = S \u00b7P \u2217. The terms of trade are defined as the relative\nprice of foreign goods in terms of home goods expressed in the domestic currency,\nthat is, T \u2261 PF\nPH\n.\n1\nFinally, V is an increasing convex function of household j \u2019s supply of the\ndifferentiated good y(j).\nTotal demands of the home and foreign differentiated goods are then given by\nyd(h) =\n[\np(h)\nPH\n]\u2212\u03c3 (\nPH\nP\n)\u2212\u03b8\nCW, yd(f ) =\n[\np(f )\nPF\n]\u2212\u03c3 (\nPF\nP\n)\u2212\u03b8\nCW, (1)\nwhere CW is the aggregate consumption in the whole economy. Applying the\nappropriate aggregate operators we obtain the domestic and foreign aggregate\ndemand as\nYH =\n(\nPH\nP\n)\u2212\u03b8\nCW , YF =\n(\nPF\nP\n)\u2212\u03b8\nCW . (2)\nFrom (2), it follows that changes in the terms of trade create dispersion of output\nacross countries.\nAs in Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002), we assume that markets are complete\nboth at a domestic and international level so that households have access to a\ncomplete set of state-contingent one-period nominal securities denominated in the\n48 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\ncurrency of the Home country. Along with the assumption that initial wealth is\nidentical among all the household, it follows that marginal utilities of income are\nequalized across and within countries at all times and across all states of nature:\nUC(Ct) = UC(C\u2217t ) (3)\nEquation (3) is derived from the set of optimality conditions that characterize the\noptimal allocation of wealth among the state-contingent securities.\nOur model is in the class of the cashless-limiting economies discussed in\nWoodford (2003).\n1.2. Price-Setting Behavior\nEach producer of a single differentiated good acts in a monopolistic-competitive\nmarket. The demand of the differentiated good, (1), depends on the pricing decision\np(h), for the generic home-produced good, and p\u2217(f ), for the foreign-produced\ngood, respectively.2 By contrast, producers take as given P,PH , PF , and C. The\nprice-setting behavior is modeled following the Calvo-Yun partial adjustment rule,\nunder which each producer has the opportunity to change its price with a fixed\nprobability 1 \u2212 \u03b1 at each point in time.3 We allow this probability to be different\nacross countries.\nA home producer, that sets a new price in period t , maximizes the expected\ndiscounted value of her net profits4\nEt\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\n(\u03b1\u03b2)k\n{\nUC(Ct+k)\nPt+k\n(1 \u2212 \u03c4t+k)p\u02dct (h)y\u02dct,t+k(h) \u2212 V (y\u02dct,t+k(h), \u03beY,t+k)\n}\n,\nwhere \u03c4t is a time-varying tax on firms\u2019 revenues. With p\u02dct (h), we have denoted\nthe price of the good h chosen at date t and with y\u02dct,t+k(h) the total demand of\ngood h at time t + k conditional on the fact that the price p\u02dct (h) has not changed,\ny\u02dct,t+k(h) =\n[\np\u02dct (h)\nPH,t+k\n]\u2212\u03c3[(\nPH,t+k\nPt+k\n)\u2212\u03b8\nCt+k\n]\n. (4)\nThe optimal choice of p\u02dct (h) is\np\u02dct (h) = Et\n\u2211\u221e\nk=0(\u03b1\ni\u03b2)kVy(y\u02dct,t+k(h), \u03beY,t+k)y\u02dct,t+k(h)\nEt\n\u2211\u221e\nk=0(\u03b1i\u03b2)k (1 \u2212 \u00b5t+k) UC(Ct+k)Pt+k y\u02dct,t+k(h)\n, (5)\nwhere\n(1 \u2212 \u00b5t) \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03c4t )(\u03c3 \u2212 1)\n\u03c3\n.\nThe Calvo-style price-setting mechanism implies the following state equation for\nPH,t :\n(PH,t )\n1\u2212\u03c3 = \u03b1(PH,t\u22121)1\u2212\u03c3 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)p\u02dct (h)1\u2212\u03c3 .

LOG-LINEAR APPROXIMATION TO THE EQUILIBRIUM\nCONDITIONS\nWe log-linearize the model around the deterministic steady state in which mo-\nnopolistic distortions are eliminated by a taxation subsidy, that is, \u00b5\u00af= 1. By log-\nlinearizing (5), (6), and their foreign correspondents, we obtain the two aggregate\nsupply (AS) equations for the Home and Foreign country:\n\u03c0H,t = \u03ba[( \u02c6YH,t \u2212 \u02dcYH,t ) + (1 \u2212 n)\u03c8( \u02c6Tt \u2212 \u02dcTt ) + ut ] + \u03b2Et\u03c0H,t+1, (7)\n\u03c0\u2217F,t = \u03ba\u2217[( \u02c6Y \u2217F,t \u2212 \u02dcYF,t ) \u2212 n\u03c8( \u02c6Tt \u2212 \u02dcTt ) + u\u2217t ] + \u03b2Et\u03c0\u2217F,t+1, (8)\nwhere \u03bai \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03b1i)(1 \u2212 \u03b1i\u03b2)(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\/[\u03b1i(1 + \u03c3\u03b7)] and \u03c8 \u2261 (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8)\/(\u03c1 + \u03b7).\nVariables with the hat denotes log-deviations of the respective variable from the\nsteady-state value (T\u0302t , \u02c6YH,t , and \u02c6Y \u2217F,t are the deviation of the terms of trade,\ndomestic, and foreign output from their steady state.5), whereas we have defined\n\u03c0H,t \u2261 ln \fH,t , \u03c0\u2217F,t \u2261 ln \f\u2217F,t and Tt =PF,t\/PH,t . The variables \u02dcCt, \u02dcTt , \u02dcYH,t , \u02dcYF,t\nare the following functions of the shocks:6\n\u02dcCt \u2261 \u03b7\n(\u03b7 + \u03c1) a\u02c6W,t ,\n\u02dcTt = \u03b7\n(1 + \u03b8\u03b7) a\u02c6R,t , (9)\n\u02dcYH,t \u2261 \u02dcCt + (1 \u2212 n)\u03b8 \u02dcTt , \u02dcYF,t \u2261 \u02dcCt \u2212 n\u03b8 \u02dcTt , (10)\nwith a\u02c6R,t \u2261 a\u02c6t \u2212 a\u02c6\u2217t and a\u02c6W,t \u2261 na\u02c6t + (1 \u2212 n)a\u02c6\u2217t . In what follows we will refer to\n\u02dcTt as a terms of trade shock (a combination of the Home and Foreign productivity\nshocks). More important, ut and u\u2217t represent inefficient supply shocks that capture\nthe deviations of the flexible-price allocation from the efficient allocation [for the\ncase in which \u00b5\u00af= 1, the efficient allocation for the respective variables is charac-\nterized by equations (9) to (10)]. In our context, these deviations are produced by\nvariations in the distortionary taxes that apply to the firms\u2019 revenues. In particular,\nin equations (7) and (8) ut and u\u2217t are just proportional to the markup shocks:\nut = \u00b5\u02c6t\n(\u03b7 + \u03c1) , u\n\u2217\nt =\n\u00b5\u02c6\u2217t\n(\u03b7 + \u03c1) . (11)\nIn the AS equations (7) and (8), GDP inflation rates depend on the present dis-\ncounted value of the aggregate real marginal costs. In general, in open economies,\nreal marginal costs are not only proportional to the output gap, but they also\ndepend on the terms of trade [see Svensson (2000)]. This dependence captures the\nexpenditure-switching effect; only in the special case in which \u03c1\u03b8 = 1 the terms\nof trade channel disappears.\nFinally, after log-linearizing equations (2), we obtain that the terms of trade\nreflect also the differential in the countries\u2019 output gaps:\n( \u02c6Tt \u2212 \u02dcTt ) = \u03b8\u22121[( \u02c6YH,t \u2212 \u02dcYH,t ) \u2212 ( \u02c6Y \u2217F,t \u2212 \u02dcYF,t )]. (12)\n50 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\nUsing the definition of the terms of trade, we can decompose the changes in the\nterms of trade between the nominal exchange rate depreciation and the producers\u2019\ninflation rate differential\nT\u0302t = T\u0302t\u22121 + \rSt + \u03c0\u2217F,t \u2212 \u03c0H,t , (13)\nwhere \rSt = ln St\/St\u22121.\n3. OPTIMAL COOPERATIVE SOLUTION\nIn this section, we characterize the efficient response of macroeconomic variables\nto the various shocks that affect the economy, whether in the form of terms of\ntrade or inefficient supply shocks. This problem has been extensively studied\nin the Keynesian literature on international monetary cooperation [see Canzoneri\nand Henderson (1991) and Persson and Tabellini (1996)]. Importantly, we propose\nboth a microfounded model and a welfare criterion, based directly on consumers\u2019\nutility.7\nOur welfare criterion for characterizing the cooperative allocation is represented\nby the utility of the agents belonging to the world economy. As in Woodford (2003),\nwe rely on a quadratic approximation of the utility-based welfare criterion, so that\nour framework becomes comparable to the linear-quadratic models that have been\nextensively used in the Keynesian literature.\nThe quadratic approximation of the welfare criterion is taken around the steady\nstate in which the taxation subsidy completely offsets the monopolistic distor-\ntions in both countries [as in P. Benigno (2004)]. We obtain the following loss\nfunction:\nLC = (\u03c1 + \u03b7)E0\n\u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2t\n{\nn( \u02c6YH,t \u2212 \u02dcYH,t )2 + (1 \u2212 n)( \u02c6Y \u2217F,t \u2212 \u02dcYF,t )2\n+ n(1 \u2212 n)\u03b8\u03c8(T\u0302t \u2212 T\u02dct )2 + n\u03c3\n\u03ba\n(\u03c0H,t )\n2 + (1 \u2212 n)\u03c3\n\u03ba\u2217\n(\u03c0\u2217F,t )\n2\n}\n. (14)\nThe variables \u02dcYH,t , \u02dcYF,t , \u02dcTt can be interpreted as the desired targets that policy-\nmakers wish to achieve in a cooperative agreement for domestic output, foreign\noutput and the terms of trade respectively. When \u00b5\u00af= 1, these targets coincide\nwith the flexible-price allocation assuming no mark-up shocks. (see Benigno and\nBenigno, 2005, for the generalization to the case in which \u00b5\u00af \u0005= 1).\nIn the case in which \u00b5\u00af= 1, the quadratic loss function (14) can be evaluated\nby just a log-linear approximation to the structural constraints (7), (8) and (12).\nBy specifying a path for \u03c0H,t and \u03c0\u2217F,t , the variables \u02c6YH,t , \u02c6Y \u2217F,t and \u02c6Tt can be\ndetermined by (7)\u2013(8), and this is all that is needed to evaluate (14).\nIMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 51\n3.1. The Optimal Stabilization Plan under Commitment\nWe study the optimal cooperative policy under commitment from a \u201ctimeless\nperspective\u201d as discussed in Woodford (2003). This optimal plan is obtained\nby minimizing the loss function of society (14) under the structural equilibrium\nconditions (7), (8), and (12) together with the constraints implied by the \u201ctime-\nless perspective\u201d commitment on the initial conditions \u03c0H,t0 and \u03c0\u2217F,t0 given by\n\u03c0H,t0 = \u03c0\u00afH,t0 and \u03c0\u2217F,t0 = \u03c0\u00af\u2217F,t0 . Equation (13) determines residually the exchange\nrate. As discussed in Benigno and Benigno (2005), this minimization problem is\nwell behaved, that is, the loss function is convex.\nFollowing Currie and Levine (1993) and Woodford (2003), the optimal plan can\nbe described using the Lagrangian method, with multiplier \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 associated\nwith the aggregate supply equations (7) and (8) and \u03bb3 associated with equation\n(13).\nTo study the optimal cooperative allocation in this more general case, we write\nthe following Lagrangian:\nL = Et0\n\u221e\u2211\nt=t0\n\u03b2t\u2212t0(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\n[\n1\n2\nny2H,t +\n1\n2\n(1 \u2212 n)y\u22172F,t +\n1\n2\nn(1 \u2212 n)\u03b8\u03c8q2t +\n1\n2\n\u03c3n\n\u03ba\n\u03c02H,t\n+ 1\n2\n\u03c3(1 \u2212 n)\n\u03ba\u2217\n\u03c0\u22172F,t\n]\n+ n\u03bb1,t [\u03ba\u22121\u03c0H,t \u2212 yH,t \u2212 (1 \u2212 n)\u03c8qt \u2212 \u03b2\u03ba\u22121\u03c0H,t+1]\n+ (1 \u2212 n)\u03bb2,t [\u03ba\u2217\u22121\u03c0\u2217F,t \u2212 y\u2217F,t + n\u03c8qt \u2212 \u03b2\u03ba\u2217\u22121\u03c0\u2217F,t+1] + n(1 \u2212 n)\u03bb3,t\n\u00d7 [qt \u2212 \u03b8\u22121yH,t + \u03b8\u22121y\u2217F,t ] \u2212 n\u03bb1,t0\u22121\u03ba\u22121\u03c0H,t0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 n)\u03bb2,t0\u22121\u03ba\u2217\u22121\u03c0\u2217F,t0 ,\nwhere we have defined yH,t \u2261 ( \u02c6YH,t \u2212 \u02dcYH,t ), y\u2217F,t \u2261 ( \u02c6Y \u2217F,t \u2212 \u02dcYF,t ) and qt \u2261 ( \u02c6Tt \u2212 \u02dcTt ),\nand we have appropriately normalized the Lagrangian multiplier in a way to obtain\ntime-invariant first-order conditions. The first-order condition with respect to yH,t ,\ny\u2217F,t , and qt are\n(\u03c1 + \u03b7)yH,t = \u03bb1,t + (1 \u2212 n)\u03b8\u22121\u03bb3,t , (15)\n(\u03c1 + \u03b7)y\u2217F,t = \u03bb2,t \u2212 n\u03b8\u22121\u03bb3,t , (16)\n(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\u03b8\u03c8qt = \u03c8\u03bb1,t \u2212 \u03c8\u03bb2,t \u2212 \u03bb3,t , (17)\nfor each t \u2265 t0, while the ones with respect to \u03c0H,t and \u03c0\u2217F,t are\n(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\u03c3\u03c0H,t = \u2212(\u03bb1,t \u2212 \u03bb1,t\u22121), (18)\n(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\u03c3\u03c0\u2217F,t = \u2212(\u03bb2,t \u2212 \u03bb2,t\u22121), (19)\nfor each t \u2265 t0.\nWe can characterize some implications of the optimal cooperative solution\nwithout the need of solving this set of equations. Indeed, we can use equations\n52 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\n(15), (16), (17), and (12) to obtain\nyH,t = \u2212\u03bb1,t , (20)\ny\u2217F,t = \u2212\u03bb2,t , (21)\nwhich imply the following relations between producer inflation rates and output\ngaps:\n\u03c3(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\u03c0H,t = yH,t \u2212 yH,t\u22121, (22)\n\u03c3(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\u03c0\u2217F,t = yF,t \u2212 yF,t\u22121. (23)\nUnder the optimal cooperative solution each country should adjust its domestic\nproducer inflation in response to changes in its domestic output gap. Equations\n(22) and (23) are similar to the conditions that would hold in the closed-economy\ncase under commitment.\nAs we show in Benigno and Benigno (2005), following terms of trade shocks,\nthe optimal cooperative plan requires to completely offset these shocks with move-\nments in the exchange rate and the terms of trade by setting \u03c0H,t =\u03c0\u2217F,t = 0 in each\nperiod. All the gaps are closed. Indeed, the first-best is achieved and the optimal\ncooperative equilibrium replicates the efficient allocation.\nBy contrast, under inefficient supply shocks the first best cannot be achieved\nand producer inflation rates are state contingent. The presence of inefficient supply\nshocks creates a further distortion in the economy. Stabilizing producer inflation\nrates to zero is suboptimal and a sticky price allocation can improve on the flexible\nprice one. However, \u03c0H,t and \u03c0F,t should move proportionally to their respective\noutput-gap growths.\n3.2. The Transmission Mechanism of Inefficient Supply Shocks\nWe now focus on how inefficient supply shocks propagate across different coun-\ntries. We start by considering the special case \u03b8 = \u03c1\u22121. Under this restriction, the\ncentralized welfare criterion can be written as a weighted average of Home and\nForeign domestic targets:\nLCt = nLH,t + (1 \u2212 n)LF,t , (24)\nwith\nLH,t = (\u03c1 + \u03b7) \u00b7 (yH,t )2 + \u03c3(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\n\u03ba\n(\u03c0H,t )\n2,\nLF,t = (\u03c1 + \u03b7) \u00b7 (y\u2217F,t )2 +\n\u03c3(\u03c1 + \u03b7)\n\u03ba\u2217\n(\u03c0\u2217F,t )\n2,\nwhere LH,t and LF,t correspond to the loss functions that can be obtained from\nquadratic approximations of the welfare of the single countries, but in a closed-\neconomy model, as shown in Woodford (2003). Moreover, the two aggregate\nIMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 53\nsupply equations becomes\n\u03c0H,t = \u03ba[( \u02c6YH,t \u2212 \u02dcYH,t ) + ut ] + \u03b2Et\u03c0H,t+1, (25)\n\u03c0\u2217F,t = \u03ba\u2217[( \u02c6Y \u2217F,t \u2212 \u02dcYF,t ) + u\u2217t ] + \u03b2Et\u03c0\u2217F,t+1, (26)\nIn the optimal cooperative solution, the couple of sequences {\u03c0H,t , yH,t } and\n{\u03c0\u2217F,t , y\u2217F,t } should only react to their respective inefficient supply shocks.\nPROPOSITION 1. When there are inefficient supply shocks, if \u03b8\u03c1 = 1, the op-\ntimal paths of the producer inflation rates and output gaps in each country mirror\nthe one that would arise in a closed-economy model.\nInflation and output gap are orthogonal to the inefficient supply shocks of the\nother country.\nUsing this limiting case, we now discuss the more general case in which the\ncondition \u03b8\u03c1 = 1 is not met. In the optimal cooperative solution, the transmission\nmechanism of inefficient supply shocks depends crucially on \u03b8\u03c1 being greater or\nless than 1. Using (18) and (19), we obtain\npH,t = \u03bb1,t\n\u03c3 (\u03c1 + \u03b7) , (27)\np\u2217F,t =\n\u03bb\u22172,t\n\u03c3 (\u03c1 + \u03b7) . (28)\nComparing with (20) and (21), it follows that the output gap in each country is\nnegatively related to its respective producer price level.8 Consider a positive (ad-\nverse) supply shock in the Home country. As in the closed-economy counterpart,\nthis shock produces on impact inflation in the Home country and a reduction in\nthe output gap. The increase in the producer price level in country H tends to\nimprove the terms of trade of that country and worsen those of country F (i.e., T\ndecreases). The impact on foreign inflation and output gap depends on \u03b8\u03c1. First,\nassume \u03b8\u03c1 < 1 (what can be labeled as the \u201cpositive correlated scenario\u201d). From\n(8), an improvement of the foreign terms of trade increases on impact foreign\nproducer inflation and the foreign producer price level (not enough to offset the\ninitial decrease in T ). Then the foreign output gap should also decrease. Under\nthis scenario, an adverse shock in the Home economy will produce the same\npattern of producer inflation and output gap in both countries, still with different\nmagnitude.\nThe intuition is related to whether the worsening in the foreign terms of trade\nincreases or decreases the marginal revenues in utility terms of the foreign firms.\nIn fact, marginal revenue depends on the factor:\nUC(Ct)PF,t\nPt\n=\nUC\n[\nYF,t\n(\nPF,t\nPt\n)\u03b8]\nPF,t\nPt\n,\n54 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\nwhich represents firms\u2019 marginal revenues in utility terms as if market were\nperfectly competitive. When the elasticity of the marginal revenue with respect\nto the terms of trade is positive, a worsening in the foreign terms of trade decreases\nthe marginal revenues since the increase in the general level of prices P offsets\nthe increase in the marginal utility of consumption. This is so when \u03b8\u03c1 < 1. Given\nthat marginal revenues fall, foreign firms should rise their prices in order to protect\ntheir profits. The expenditure switching effect captured by the parameter \u03b8 is not\nso strong to sustain a positive output gap in the foreign economy. So, output gap\nin the foreign economy falls.\nBy contrast, when \u03b8\u03c1 > 1 (what can be labeled as the \u201cnegative correlated\nscenario\u201d), the marginal revenues of the firms increases in country F, so that\nthey can cut their prices on impact. The foreign output gap increases because the\nexpenditure-switching effect is stronger. In this case, the adverse supply shock\nproduces on impact inflation in the home economy and a deflation in the foreign\neconomy, whereas home output gap falls and foreign output gap rises. In later\nquarters, the home economy will experience periods of deflation, whereas the\nforeign economy will experience periods of inflation.\n4. IMPLEMENTING THE COOPERATIVE SOLUTION\nIn this section, we investigate whether it is possible that policies acting in a\nnoncooperative way can implement the optimal cooperative solution. Recently,\nObstfeld and Rogoff (2002) have shown that self-oriented monetary policy makers\ncan replicate the cooperative outcome in a decentralized framework so that there\nis no need of international monetary policy coordination. In their case, \u201cself-\noriented\u201d refers to policymakers that maximize the welfare of the consumers\nwithin their countries.\nIn a previous works [Benigno and Benigno (2003, 2005)], we have shown that in\nthis model there are gains from cooperation as long as \u03b8 \u0005= 1, so that self-oriented\npolicy makers would not behave optimally.9 In particular, in Benigno and Benigno\n(2005), we have discussed how it is possible to replicate the optimal cooperative\nallocation through the adoption of targeting rules.\nHere we look at the problem from a different perspective. We try to design\ninstitutions expressed in terms of loss function (rather than targeting rules) and\nanalyze how the assignment of these loss function to each monetary authority can\nimplement the cooperative solution in a strategic setting. In particular, we seek to\ndesign objective functions for monetary policy makers that are able to commit,\nbut interact in strategic context.10 These objective functions do not necessarily\ncoincide with the utility based welfare of the country.11\nFollowing the recent widespread adoption of inflation-targeting regimes across\nseveral countries, we assume that each policy maker is committed to an inflation-\ntargeting regime. In particular, we assume that home and foreign policy maker\nare committed to minimize their respective loss functions L and L \u2217 of the\nIMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 55\nform\nL = E0\n{ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2t (\u03c1 + \u03b7)\n[\n\u000fy2H,t +\n\u03c3\n\u03ba\n\u03c02H,t\n]}\n(29)\nL\u2217 = E0\n{ \u221e\u2211\nt=0\n\u03b2t (\u03c1 + \u03b7)\n[\n\u000f \u2217y\u22172F,t +\n\u03c3\n\u03ba\u2217\n\u03c0\u22172F,t\n]}\n,\nwhere \u000f and \u000f \u2217 are nonnegative parameters.\nThese loss functions correspond to \u201cflexible\u201d inflation-targeting regimes using\nthe terminology of Svensson (2002), where each policy maker is penalized for the\ndeviations of the inflation rate from the target (zero in this case), and for changes\nin the output gap. In practice, this seems a good representation of the objective\nfunction of monetary policy maker in inflation-targeting regimes, as discussed in\nSvensson (2002), and even in other regimes; see Blinder (1997) for the U.S. case.\nThe open-economy extension of \u201cinflation-targeting\u201d regimes requires an ad-\nditional qualification in terms of choosing the proper measure of inflation rate to\ntarget, that is, whether GDP or CPI inflation. One justification for designing our\nregimes in terms of GDP inflation rate follows from the works by Aoki (2001) and\nP. Benigno (2004), in which the inflation coming from sectors with sticky prices is\nthe appropriate inflation to target when trying to minimize the distortions existing\nin the economy. Moreover, we want to restrict our analysis to policy makers that are\ninward-looking in the sense that their loss functions include only domestic targets.\nWe note here that there is another dimension along which the policy makers are\nself-oriented: We assume that they interact strategically as in a Nash equilibrium\nwhere each policy maker sets the strategy in terms of her producer inflation and\ntakes the strategy of the other policymaker as given.\nAs in Rogoff (1985), our delegation problem boils down to choosing appro-\npriately the relative weights to the output gap and the producer inflation rate in\nthe loss function. In our case, the parameters \u000f and \u000f \u2217 are chosen so that the\nallocation that results from the strategic interaction between the policy makers\nreplicates the cooperative solution.\nWe show that there is always a positive answer to this problem. We first note that\nwhen the only disturbances are given by terms of trade shocks, the decentralized\ncommitment to loss function L and L\u2217 reproduces the cooperative solution for any\n\u000f and \u000f \u2217. From the discussion in the previous sections, under terms of trade\nshocks, stabilizing producer inflation rates to zero, in each country, achieves the\nfirst-best. There are enough instruments to cope with all the distortions in the\neconomy. Because in this case there is no trade-off between domestic output-gap\nand producer inflation rate, then any loss function in the class of flexible inflation-\ntargeting rule L and L\u2217 can achieve the first-best in a noncooperative allocation.\nWhen instead there are inefficient supply shocks, the following proposition\nholds:\n56 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\nPROPOSITION 2. In a Nash equilibrium in which each policy maker is com-\nmitted to a flexible inflation targeting policy of the form (30), following inefficient\nsupply shocks, the cooperative allocation can be achieved if and only if\n\u000f = \u03b8(\u03c1 + \u03b7) + (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8)\n\u03b8(\u03c1 + \u03b7) + n(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8) , \u000f =\n\u03b8(\u03c1 + \u03b7) + (1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8)\n\u03b8(\u03c1 + \u03b7) + (1 \u2212 n)(1 \u2212 \u03c1\u03b8) ,\nIn particular \u000f > 1 and \u000f \u2217 > 1 if \u03c1\u03b8 < 1 and \u000f < 1 and \u000f \u2217 < 1 if \u03c1\u03b8 > 1. Note\nthat when \u03c1\u03b8 = 1, then the cooperative allocation can be replicated if and only if\n\u000f =\u000f \u2217 = 1.\nWhen \u03c1\u03b8 = 1 there is complete separation in the optimal stabilization plan\nbetween Home and Foreign inefficient supply shocks. Indeed, domestic output\ngap and inflation rate should react only to domestic inefficient shocks and not to\nforeign ones. An inspection of the centralized welfare criterion (24) can help to\nidentify the appropriate design of the decentralized solution. It is sufficient that\neach policy maker commits to maximize its appropriate targets, producer inflation\nand output gap, in the exact combination as they are in (24). It is again worth noting\nthat when \u000f =\u000f \u2217 = 1 the loss functions L and L\u2217 correspond to the losses that\none would get as an approximation of the welfare in the closed-economy version\nof this model. Because there is no strategic interdependence in the stabilization\nproblem, policy makers can implement the cooperative allocation by minimizing\na \u201cclosed-economy\u201d loss function.12\nWe now discuss the general case, \u03c1\u03b8 \u0005= 1. We can write equations (7) and (8)\nusing condition (12) as\n\u03c0H,t = \u03ba[yH,t + (1 \u2212 n)\u03c8\u03b8\u22121(yH,t \u2212 y\u2217F,t ) + ut ] + \u03b2Et\u03c0H,t+1, (30)\n\u03c0\u2217F,t = \u03ba\u2217[y\u2217F,t \u2212 n\u03c8\u03b8\u22121(yH,t \u2212 y\u2217F,t ) + u\u2217t ] + \u03b2Et\u03c0\u2217F,t+1, (31)\nfrom which we can define\np1 \u2261 \u03ba[1 + (1 \u2212 n)\u03c8\u03b8\u22121], p2 \u2261 \u2212\u03ba(1 \u2212 n)\u03c8\u03b8\u22121,\np3 \u2261 \u03ba\u2217[1 + n\u03c8\u03b8\u22121], p4 \u2261 \u2212\u03ba\u2217n\u03c8\u03b8\u22121.\nCombining these equations, we get\n\u03c0H,t = p5yH,t + \u03baut + p6(\u03b2Et\u03c0\u2217F,t+1 \u2212 \u03c0\u2217F,t ) + p6\u03ba\u2217u\u2217t + \u03b2Et\u03c0H,t+1, (32)\n\u03c0\u2217F,t = p7y\u2217F,t + \u03ba\u2217u\u2217t + p8(\u03b2Et\u03c0H,t+1 \u2212 \u03c0H,t ) + p8\u03baut + \u03b2Et\u03c0\u2217F,t+1, (33)\nwhere:\np5 = p3p1 \u2212 p2p4\np3\n, p6 = p2\np3\n,\np7 = p3p1 \u2212 p2p4\np1\n, p8 = p4\np1\n.\nIn the Nash allocation, the monetary policy maker in country H maximizes L,\nunder the constraint (32) taken as given the sequence {\u03c0\u2217F,t }\u221et=0 chosen by the policy\nIMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 57\nmaker in country F and the initial inflation rate given by the timeless-perspective\ncommitment \u03c0H,t0 = \u03c0\u02dcH,t0 .\nThe first-order necessary conditions with respect to yH,t and \u03c0H,t are\n\u000fyH,t = \u2212p5\u03c8t, (34)\n\u03c3\u03c0H,t = \u03c8t \u2212 \u03c8t\u22121, (35)\nat each date t \u2265 0 and for each possible state, where \u03c8t is the Lagrangian multiplier\nassociated with the constraint (32). Looking at the problem of policy maker F and\nmaximizing L\u2217 with respect to yF,t and \u03c0\u2217F,t , we obtain that\n\u000f \u2217y\u2217F,t = \u2212p7\u03c8\u2217t , (36)\n\u03c3\u03c0\u2217F,t = \u03c8\u2217t \u2212 \u03c8\u2217t\u22121, (37)\nat each date t \u2265 0 and for each possible state, where \u03c8\u2217t is the Lagrangian\nmultiplier associated with the constraint (32).\nThe set of equilibrium conditions (7), (8), (34), (35), (36), and (37) are equivalent\nto the set of equilibrium conditions that characterize the optimal cooperative\nsolution if and only if \u000f =p5 and \u000f \u2217 =p7.\nEven if there is a need of monetary coordination at an international level, this\nneed can be satisfied by delegating monetary policy to inward-looking institutions\nthat care only about domestic objectives. In particular, in the \u201cpositive-correlated\nscenario,\u201d a relative higher weight should be given to the stabilization of the\ndomestic output gap in comparison to the scenario in which there is no strategic\ninterdependence across countries (\u03c1\u03b8 = 1). The intuition for this result can be\nunderstood by inspecting equations (30) and (31). In fact, an adverse inefficient\nsupply shock can be absorbed by an increase in home producer inflation, a decrease\nin home output gap, and in the one-period ahead expectations on the producer\ninflation rate. When \u03c1\u03b8 < 1 and while acting strategically, each policy maker has\nan incentive to lower her output gap below the foreign one in order to export the\nshock to the other country, through an improvement of her own terms of trade.\nThis incentive creates a \u201ccontractionary\u201d bias that can be corrected by assigning a\nrelatively higher weight to the output gap in the flexible inflation-targeting regime.\nOn the contrary, when \u03c1\u03b8 > 1, each country would tend to be more expansionary\nreducing less the output gap and increasing more the response of the producer\ninflation rate. This \u201cexpansionary bias\u201d can be corrected by giving higher weight\nto the inflation rate than to the output gap in the loss function.\nA final result is related to the degree of openness. The more open is a country,\nthat is, the more the country is affected by terms of trade movements, the higher\nis the conflict in the stabilization problem. In this case, the correction should be\ngreater. Indeed, if, for example, n< 1\/2, the home country will be more open (and\nthe foreign country more closed), then \u000f > \u000f \u2217 > 1 if \u03c1\u03b8 < 1 and \u000f <\u000f \u2217 < 1 if\n\u03c1\u03b8 > 1.\n58 GIANLUCA BENIGNO AND PIERPAOLO BENIGNO\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we proposed a standard two-country dynamic general equilibrium\nmodel with imperfect competition and nominal price rigidities. Despite goods and\nfinancial market integration, there is scope for international monetary policy coor-\ndination arising from the interaction between nonunitary intratemporal elasticity\nof substitution and terms of trade shocks and the presence of inefficient supply\nshocks.\nWe show that by committing to a properly designed flexible inflation targeting\nregimes our monetary authorities can replicate the optimal outcome independently\nof the type of shock that hits the economy even in a strategic setting. Importantly,\nthese institutions are \u201cinward-looking\u201d in the sense that each policy maker cares\nonly about domestic targets\u2014the output gap and the domestic producer inflation\nrate.\nNOTES\n1. With producer currency pricing, and the law of one price holding, this is equivalent if expressed\nin foreign currency.\n2. There is indeed producer currency pricing.\n3. This probability is the same for each producer and is independent of the amount of time elapsed\nsince her last change of price.\n4. It is important to note that all the producers that belong to the same country and that can modify\ntheir price at a certain time will face the same discounted value of the streams of current and future\nmarginal costs under the assumption that the new price is maintained. Thus, they will set the same\nprice.\n5. Those deviations arise in the stochastic equilibrium in which prices are subject to the partial\nadjustment rule a la Calvo.\n6. A variable with a sub-index W denotes a weighted average of the Home and Foreign variables\nwith weights n and 1 \u2212 n, respectively. A variable with a sub-index R denotes the difference between\nthe Home and Foreign variables. We have defined \u03c1 \u2261 \u2212UCCC\/UC and \u03b7 \u2261 VyyC\/Vy, while at is\ndefined as VyyCat = \u2212VY\u03beY \u03beY,t . a\u2217t is defined appropriately. The steady-state level of consumption\nsolve the equation UC(C) = Vy(C, 0).\n7. Our approach follow the recent tradition in the open-economy literature as in Obstfeld and\nRogoff (1998, 2002), Devereux and Engel (2003), and Corsetti and Pesenti (2005). However, the latter\nworks have focused on static models, in which prices are preset one-period in advance and the only\nsource of uncertainty comes from terms of trade\u2019s shocks.\n8. Conditions (27)\u2013(28) show that the logs of the producer price levels are stationary variables\nsince both the Lagrangian multipliers and the shocks are stationary. Prices should go back to the initial\nlevel under inefficient supply shocks. This property extends directly to the nominal exchange rate.\nEven if there are no direct costs in the welfare criterion (14) related to the exchange rate volatility,\na necessary condition for an allocation to be optimal is that the exchange rate should be stationary\nfollowing stationary disturbances of any nature (i.e., terms of trade or inefficient supply shocks).\n9. Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2005) have explored the gains from coordination when there are\nimportant sectorial productivity differences within a single country.\n10. In a closed economy, Jensen (2002) and Woodford (1999) have studied the design of the\nobjective function of a monetary policy maker that is unable to fulfill credible commitments. In an\nopen-economy model, Sutherland (2005) compares our flexible targeting rules with simple operational\nrules in a static framework.\n11. See Benigno and Benigno (2005) for the analysis of the utility-based objective function of the\nsingle country.\nIMPLEMENTING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 59\n12. However, in the open-economy model, these loss functions do not corresponds to the second-\norder approximation of the welfare of the single countries, as the welfare of each country has an\nhigher weight on the disutility of output relative to the utility consumption than the centralized welfare\ncriterion. Indeed, the disutility of output in the centralized criterion is weighed by the size of the\ncountry. See Benigno and Benigno (2005) for the individual welfare functions in this case.\nREFERENCES\nAoki, Kosuke (2001) Optimal monetary policy responses to relative-price changes.
