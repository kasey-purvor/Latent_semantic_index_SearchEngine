A Review Article \nPeter Wilson, London School of Economics and Political Science \n \n(Accepted July 2007 for publication in The Round Table) \n \nChristopher Ondaatje, Woolf in Ceylon: An Imperial Journey in the Shadow of \nLeonard Woolf (London: Harper Collins, 2005), pp. 326, i-xiii. \n \nVictoria Glendinning, Leonard Woolf: A Life (London: Simon and Schuster, \n2006), pp. 530, i-xii. \n  \nLeonard Woolf (1880-1969) is a significant figure for students of international \nrelations and imperial history for four reasons. First, his report for the Fabian \nSociety on the prevention of war, published in 1916 as International \nGovernment, was extensively used by the British delegation at the Paris \nPeace Conference of 1919. It had a major influence on the social and \neconomic provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. It was also the first \nbook to demonstrate that international government, defined loosely as the \nconduct of international relations according to rules and regulations, was not \nonly practicable, but a good deal of it already existed.  \n \nSecondly, Woolf\u2019s The War for Peace (1940) is the only full length \nresponse to E. H. Carr\u2019s classic but also highly polemical The Twenty Years\u2019 \nCrisis (Carr, 1939). While acknowledging that Carr was a brilliant man with \nmany challenging and insightful things to say about the world political scene, \n 1\nWoolf felt the book was mischievous, irresponsible and in certain respects \nplain wrong. A passionate man, Woolf could hardly contain his emotions in \nresponding to Carr\u2019s book, and the result is an angry counter-polemic. But it is \none that scores a number of direct hits, particularly with regard to the \nconceptual imprecision of the twin conceptual pillars of Carr\u2019s analysis, \n\u2018reality\u2019 and \u2018utopia\u2019, and the implication of Carr\u2019s employment of these terms \nthat anything that succeeds is a manifestation of \u2018realism\u2019 and anything that \nfails is ipso facto utopian. Woolf was a left-liberal progressive, operating in \nthat vague intellectual space between Fabian socialism and New Liberalism.1 \nHe believed that ideas and ideals mattered in international politics, and \ndetested the implication of Carr\u2019s analysis that in the international sphere to \nhave ideals is to court \u2018utopianism\u2019. What is striking from the point of view of \nthe history of ideas is that, despite their disagreements, both Carr and Woolf \nwere men of the Left. Among other things, they were passionate advocates of \na post-nationalist, functionalist, and collectivist world order (Wilson, 2003, pp. \n200-07). They believed this would be the almost inevitable outcrop of the \ndevastation of World War Two, and the economic and political chaos of the \nfiercely nationalist international anarchy that preceded it. They both rejected \nthe nineteenth century assumption of a natural harmony of interests, but \nsubscribed to the twentieth century hope of manufacturing such a harmony \nvia ever-greater social, scientific, technical knowledge (Wilson, 1998). Events \nwere soon to prove them both wrong, and the historically and theoretically \nminded student is left with some fascinating material for rethinking the \nquestion of \u2018practicality\u2019 in international affairs and the broader question of the \nnature, scope and prospects of progressive change. \n 2\n Thirdly, in works such as Economic Imperialism (1920), Imperialism \nand Civilization (1928), and especially Empire and Commerce in Africa \n(1920), Woolf played a major part in the erosion of the intellectual foundations \nof the British empire.  In addition, his extensive research and propaganda \nwork for such bodies as the Labour Party Advisory Committee on Imperial \nQuestions (secretary 1924-45) and the Fabian Colonial Bureau (co-founder \nwith Margaret Cole and Rita Hinden 1940), contributed to the crisis of \nconfidence in empire, its feasibility and ethical foundations, that eventually led \nto its demise. Importantly, Woolf was one of a small number of critics of \nempire (whose number include George Orwell and Sir Sydney Olivier), who at \none time was employed in running one.  Fresh from Cambridge, and the \nrarefied atmosphere of the Apostles (the Cambridge Conversazione Society, \nof which G.E. Moore, John Maynard Keynes, and Lytton Strachey were \nleading lights), Woolf found himself in Jaffna, Kandy, and Hambantota as a \ncolonial administrator in Ceylon. During his tenure as Assistant Government \nAgent (AGA), 1908-1911, in the Hambantota District of southern Ceylon, \nWoolf kept a detailed diary of his activities. Decades later these diaries were \npublished (1962) by the Ceylon Historical Society and The Hogarth Press \n(which Leonard and his wife Virgina founded in 1917). They provide a \nremarkable account of the day-to-day workings of one small corner of the \nBritish empire in the first decade of the twentieth century, and in their own way \nthrow light on the nature of the imperial project in toto. Allied with three Stories \nfrom the East (1921), his novel Village in the Jungle (1913)\u2014undervalued in \nthe pantheon of colonial literature, but now coming into its own as a work of \n 3\nthe first rank\u2014and the second (and best) volume of Woolf\u2019s celebrated \nautobiography, they provide an outstanding resource for students of imperial \nconsciousness and government. One of those involved in bringing Woolf\u2019s \nofficial diaries into press described The Village in the Jungle as \u2018the best work \nof creative writing in English on Ceylon.\u20192 Another described it as \u2018the finest \nimaginative work based on life in this country\u2026by no means inferior to \nForster\u2019s A Passage to India\u2019.3 In the view of T. J. Barron, in one of the few \ncareful studies of Woolf\u2019s experiences in Ceylon, the novel is  \none of the finest pieces of social analysis which British Ceylon \nproduced. Its understanding of traditional peasant society is \nastonishing, its delineation of the process whereby that society \nsuccumbs to economic pressure, masterly. All subsequent historical \nresearch on the problem in Ceylon has endorsed what Woolf asserts \n(Baron, 1977, 57-8). \n \n\u2018Pearls and Swine\u2019, based on his experiences superintending the Pearl \nFishery at Marichchukkaddi on the north-west coast in 1906 (see Glendinning, \npp.88-90), and written along with two other stories shortly after he left Ceylon \n(though not published until 1921), was ranked by one reviewer \u2018among the \nbest short stories in the world\u2019.4  \n \nFourthly, and most generally, Woolf spent a large part of his long life \nengaged in international relations, and he gave a valuable account of this life \nin the aforementioned autobiography, especially volumes 3-5. He was never a \ndiplomat, nor a professional politician (though he did stand, unenthusiastically, \nfor Parliament in 1922), but he was a leading (and in some cases founding) \nmember of such bodies as the League of Nations Union, the Labour Party \nAdvisory Committee on International Questions (secretary 1918-45), and the \nNew Fabian Research Bureau. He published extensively on international \n 4\nissues, including over a dozen books and many hundred articles.5 In addition, \nas director and commissioning editor of the Hogarth Press he was responsible \nfor publishing the work of many radical and liberal figures of the day, J. M. \nKeynes, H. G. Wells, and J. A. Hobson included.6  He pioneered documentary \njournalism during his editorship in the early 1920s of the International Review. \nEach month this publication included a large section devoted to the \npublication and review of important international documents. The object was \nexplicitly Wilsonian: to contribute to the new spirit of openness symbolised by \nthe principle of \u2018open covenants openly arrived at\u2019 (thereby furthering popular \neducation and trust in international relations). The journal proved short lived, \nthough the documentary section continued to appear for a while in its \nsuccessor publication, also edited by Woolf, the Contemporary Review. The \nfull story and fate of these path-breaking publications remains untold.  \n \nOther noteworthy roles and achievements include the founding in 1931 \n(with William Robson, a public administration professor at LSE) of the centre-\nLeft journal Political Quarterly, and his editorship of it singly or jointly until \n1959; and his involvement with the New Statesman, from the early pieces he \ncontributed as an aspiring political journalist in the 1910s, to his seat on the \nboard of directors 1942-65. All told, we have in Woolf a fascinating \u2018Life on the \nLeft\u2019, to cite the title of the excellent biography of Woolf\u2019s fellow Labour \nintellectual, Harold Laski (Kramnick and Sheerman, 1993). But of course it \nwas more than a life on the Left, it was an international life on the Left. Most of \nWoolf\u2019s writing and campaigning was informed by and sought to advance a \nprogressive Left-internationalism.7 This was rational and reformist in \n 5\ncharacter, but radical in many of its goals and implications. While Woolf, \nunlike many Marxist and radical liberal colleagues, recognised the relative \npermanence of national sovereignty, he also maintained that in the modern \ninterdependent world many aspects of it had become a sham. He saw in the \nmisfit between the (growing interdependent) social and economic organisation \nof the world and its (stubbornly nationalistic) political organisation, the seeds \nof many international disagreements and antagonisms (see Wilson, 2003, pp. \n44-51). The need, therefore, was to regulate sovereignty, to clip its wings and \nbring it under some sort of communal control for communal purposes. In this \nregard Woolf\u2019s life on the Left marched in step with his life in avant-garde \npublishing and his artistic and literary life in Bloomsbury. \n \nWoolf in the Literature \nUntil recently Leonard Woolf was regarded as the poor relation of \nBloomsbury. He was recognised for the contribution he made to nurturing his \nwife\u2019s genius, and nursing her through two periods of near-fatal emotional and \nmental breakdown\u2014though some feminist authors have derided, and even \nreviled him for his allegedly domineering approach (see Glendinning, p. 507). \nHis vigorous protection and advancement of Virginia\u2019s literary legacy after her \ndeath has also been noted. In addition, he received some recognition for his \ntireless committee work for Left causes and organisations, and for adding \nsome ballast of common sense and sexual restraint to extravagant and \npromiscuous Bloomsbury. The former British diplomat, Sir Duncan Wilson, \npenned a competent but uninspiring political biography of Leonard Woolf in \n1978. While it served to bring to the attention of the reading public the \n 6\ndiversity and some of the hitherto hidden achievements of Woolf\u2019s career, it \nfailed to capture the vitality, the passion, and moral strength of the man.  \nAnother former diplomat, this time American, put things on a much sounder \npath with an edition of Woolf\u2019s letters, published to considerable acclaim in \n1990. As well as revealing the breathtaking range of Woolf\u2019s activities, and the \nintelligence he brought to so many of them, this volume also contained a lucid \nand astute mini-biography in the introductions to each of the six sections of \nthe volume. I added two essays on Leonard Woolf\u2019s thought on \ninternationalism and imperialism in 1995, which were later incorporated into a \ndetailed account and assessment of his international thought in 2003. But \nwhile this book may have been \u2018thorough and judicious\u2019, as Sir Bernard Crick \ngenerously conceded, it was also \u2018far too academic\u2019 to capture the attention of \n\u2018general intellectuals\u2019 (Crick, 2006, p.501). The literary and personal side of \nthe equation was fortified by two portraits of the marriage and literary \npartnership of Leonard and Virginia, one for a general readership (Spater and \nParsons, 1977) and one for a more specialist\u2014framed in terms of the \n\u2018Outsiders\u2019 Society\u2019 that Virginia advanced in her path-braking feminist critique \nof patriarchy and war, Three Guineas (Rosenfeld, 2000; V. Woolf, 1991 \n[1938]). In 2002 the letters between Leonard and the last love of his life, \nTrekkie Parsons, the wife of Ian Parsons, fellow publisher and director of \nChatto and Windus (which took a fifty per cent stake in the Hogarth  Press in \n1946) were published (Adamson, 2002). Further information and portraits on \nthe literary side of Woolf\u2019s life, his relationship with Virginia and the \nBloomsbury circle can be found in several recently published memoirs and \n 7\nintroductions to new editions of his books (e.g. Bell, 1995; Nicolson, 2000; \nWoolf, 2005). \n \nThese works have all contributed to bringing Leonard Woolf\u2019s life and \ncareer out of the shadow of his more illustrious Bloomsbury colleagues, and \nwith Ondaatje\u2019s elegant volume on Woolf\u2019s relationship with Ceylon, the main \naspects of Woolf\u2019s career have now received the scholarly attention they \ndeserve.  Entrepreneur and publisher turned novelist and biographer, \nChristopher Ondaatje has produced a book which is part travelogue, part \nbiography,  part literary analysis, part photographic essay, part historical \nsketch, and part reminisces and reflections on his native land. One might think \nsuch eclecticism a recipe for disaster, but in the hands of this imaginative yet \nmeasured author\u2014much in the spirit of its subject\u2014the book works \nwonderfully well. Ondaatje in effect uses Woolf\u2019s diaries, letters, fictional \nworks, and autobiographies as a vehicle for telling a personal, but also \ncarefully researched story about Sri Lanka\/Ceylon\u2014its history, social \nevolution, culture, religions, and it tragic and terrible ethnic conflict. It vividly \nshows the passing of an old world (of poverty, unsustainable subsistence \nmicro-economies, repressive social hierarchies, endemic exploitation, \neveryday cruelty and ignorance), but how the new world (modern, capitalist, \nincreasingly globalised) has not managed to shake off many parts of its shell. \nAnyone looking for a readable introduction to Sri Lanka should look no further \nthan this\u2014especially if they have an interest in Bloomsbury and twentieth \ncentury literature. The exquisitely reproduced photographic prints\u2014both \ncontemporary and historical\u2014and the production quality of this cloth bound \n 8\nedition add to the pleasure of this valuable contribution to the growing \nliterature on Woolf.  \nWanted\u2014A  Biography \nThe one towering omission over the last two decades, however, has been a \nfully-fledged biography. With the publication of Leonard Woolf: A Life this \nomission has now been rectified\u2014and by an author renowned for her \nbiographies of such demanding subjects as Jonathan Swift, Vita Sackville-\nWest, and Rebecca West. There are many impressive features of Victoria \nGlendinning\u2019s book. First of all, she weaves together the personal and political \nin Woolf\u2019s life with tremendous skill, bringing real depth of understanding to \nbear, and ample wit.  Secondly, the volume is exceptionally well researched. \nEvery aspect of Leonard Woolf\u2019s life is covered, even that aspect, which \nadmirers and detractors of Bloomsbury lap up with equal relish, that Woolf \nhimself refused to comment on, except in the most brief and elliptical terms\u2014\nhis sex life and that of Virginia and other Bloomsbury figures. I do not wish to \ncomment extensively on this here, except to say that Leonard Woolf was a \npassionate man and made a great and fully self-conscious sacrifice in \nmarrying a woman with whom he knew sexual activity would be problematic. \nWhen Leonard first started to court Virginia\u2019s affections, from his Kachcheri in \nthe jungle8, he was well aware that he was now in his thirties, had not found \nlove, and had little prospect of doing so in the confined white society of \ncolonial Ceylon. But the brothels of the Orient had provided him with ample \nsexual experience. Virgina, only a few years younger, was equally desirous of \nfinding a love-match, but in contrast to her future husband, and as her given \nname betokened, she was sexually almost completely innocent. Moreover, \n 9\nshe was a highly sensitive woman, aware of her unique gifts of perception and \nexpression (though her first novel was not to appear until 1915, two years \nafter Leonard\u2019s), but prone to mental instability and even breakdown under \nconditions of extreme excitement, emotional turmoil, or mental fatigue. She \nsuffered her first mental breakdown after the death of her father, the eminent \nVictorian man of letters Sir Leslie Stephen, in 1904. \n \nGeorge Spater and Ian Parsons tellingly entitled their portrait of the \nWoolf partnership, after Shakespeare,9 \u2018A Marriage of True Minds\u2019. Leonard\u2019s \nlove for Virgina, as Glendinning compellingly shows, was passionate and \nunreserved. But from the outset he knew that while their intellectual and \nspiritual union would be unusually deep and intimate, their physical union \nwould remain unfulfilled. This is not to say Virginia was a prude\u2014quite the \ncontrary. She was both attracted and repulsed by Leonard\u2019s strangeness: his \nJewishness, his relatively modest background, his impecuniousness, and his \ntales from the East of natives, hangings, and prostitutes. She revelled in this \nand for a while, according to her sister Vanessa, talked of nothing else. As \nGlendinning so aptly says, Leonard \u2018captured Virginia\u2019s imagination as Othello \nthe Moor. \u201cwith all my travel\u2019s history\u201d10 captured Desdemona\u2019s\u2019 (Glendinning, \np.131). \n \nProbably the chief contribution of the biography is to dispel once and \nfor all the myth that the marriage was dysfunctional. Leonard has often been \nportrayed as the culprit, suffocating Virginia\u2019s creativity with his dourness, \nsexual resentment, and authoritarian behaviour during her bouts of illness.11 \n 10\nVirginia meanwhile has been portrayed as the victim, unable to come to terms \nwith her ambiguous sexuality, emotionally vulnerable, clinging to Leonard for \nrespectability and security. Glendinning demonstrates that these portraits are \na gross distortion. The couple quickly became mutually dependent. Their love, \ndemonstrated in the many letters already published before this biography, \ngrew with time rather than diminished. The strict regime Woolf imposed on his \nwife during her periods of illness was probably necessary, and in any case \nwas a product of advice received from the best medical sources then \navailable (including the King\u2019s surgeon). The crudeness of treatment, \nincluding prolonged periods of bed rest and solitude, were due not to \ninsensitivity, and certainly not callousness on Leonard\u2019s part, but to the crude \nand uncertain state of knowledge on nervous and mental disorders of that \ntime. Disorders of this kind in intelligent, upper-middle class women, where no \nobvious material explanation could be found, were especially vulnerable to \nany number of Victorian prejudices about the female psyche. Rather than \nbringing about, maybe even willing, Virginia\u2019s final demise, Leonard\u2019s \nunqualified love and loyalty to Virginia both as a person and a writer was a \nnecessary ingredient of the maturation of her creative genius. He was the first \nperson to read her newly completed manuscripts.  His opinions were always \nthe ones she most trusted and valued. \n \nThe brute fact of war was a far greater factor in causing Virginia\u2019s final \nbreakdown than anything Leonard ever said or did. In a very real sense if \nVirginia was a victim of anything she was a victim of war. Having travelled \nthrough Germany in 1935 (\u2018hiding Leonard\u2019s nose\u2019 as Virginia liked to joke) \n 11\nthey had a keen appreciation of the nature of the Nazi regime. They believed \ntheir names would be on the list of those (Jews, communists, socialists, \nintellectuals, and artists) to be rounded-up and shot in the aftermath of a \nsuccessful German invasion. They agreed they would commit suicide rather \nthan fall into the hands of the Gestapo. The issue, therefore, was very much \non their minds. The days were dark, the horizon darker still, and the air over \nthe South Downs of their beloved Sussex full of the sights and sounds of \naerial combat. War, the emotional intensity of completing what was to be her \nfinal work (Between the Acts, 1941), and the anxiety that always overcame \nher regarding the critical reception of any new work, were the major causes of \nVirginia\u2019s final descent. As it turned out they were right in their assumptions \nabout the Gestapo: they were listed together on the notorious \nSonderfahndunliste retrieved from Nazi offices after the war. The fear that \nimpelled them to acquire a prescription for morphia from Virginia\u2019s physician \nbrother, Adrian, and induced Leonard to keep a spare can of petrol in the \ngarage (see Glendinning, p.353), was not irrational. \n \nGlendinning\u2019s metier is in revealing the nature and significance of \nWoolf\u2019s relationships, and in getting to the core of his complex character \n(austere and restrained yet deeply passionate; contemplative and rational yet \nhighly obdurate in his opinions). A third great strength of the volume is that it \nmanages to be comprehensive yet balanced in the weight it gives to each of \nthe main phases and facets of Woolf\u2019s life. While his relationships with \nBloomsbury, and Virginia especially, inevitably take centre stage, his \nrelationship, often troubled, with his parents and his nine siblings are explored \n 12\nin great detail, along with his schooling at St. Paul\u2019s and his undergraduate \ndays at Trinity. More importantly for our (international historical and political) \npurposes, considerable attention is given to Woolf\u2019s career as colonial \nadministrator, political journalist, Fabian social investigator, Labour Party \nadvisor, publisher, and editor. One does not, however, find much analysis of \nhis political and international thought\u2014partly for the reason, no doubt, that this \nwas one aspect of Woolf\u2019s career that had been covered in some detail \nbefore. Yet to the extent Glendinning does treat this subject she does so in a \nrather uncritical way, accurately estimating the (considerable) contemporary \nsignificance of Woolf\u2019s work, but overstating its lasting importance. Few \nhistorians of international thought now doubt that Woolf was an important \nfigure in the development of thinking about international relations and \norganisation in the early twentieth century. His identification of the many \ndifferent types of international cooperation in existence, and the complex \nnature of the international social milieu as it had evolved since the industrial \nrevolution, changed the outlook of many observers of the international scene, \nand directly fed into David Mitrany\u2019s \u2018functionalism\u2019 of the 1930s and 40s (see \nWilson, 2003, pp.55-60; Osiander, 1998, pp. 409-32). But the books of Woolf \nthat will last well into the twenty-first century and maybe beyond are not his \novertly political books but his five volume autobiography and Village in the \nJungle. His international political works from the sober International \nGovernment and Swiftian Empire and Commerce and Africa to that caustic \nanti-Carr polemic The War for Peace and the universally ignored and \nhubristically entitled Principia Politica (1953) have long been surpassed by a \nnumber of works in the professional field of International Relations (IR). They \n 13\nare not works which teachers of the subject would recommend to students \ntoday\u2014apart, that is, from graduate students specialising in the international \nthought of the period. \n \nThe point here is that in seeking to extract Woolf from the shadows of \nhis more illustrious colleagues, and give him some limelight of his own, \nGlendinning runs the danger of elevating his stature as a political writer and \nthinker to a level that cannot be sustained. The fact is that the study of \ninternational relations (and certainly political theory in which Woolf also \ndabbled) is now much more methodologically rigorous, epistemologically self-\nconscious, and empirically more thorough than it was in Woolf\u2019s day. While \nwe may mourn the loss of the fluency and accessibility of the golden days of \nthe amateur IR theorist in the 1920s through 1940s, and certainly their desire \nto reach a broader audience, the fact remains that Woolf did not produce \nanything on a par with Waltz\u2019s Man, the State and War, Claude\u2019s Swords into \nPloughshares, Bull\u2019s Anarchical Society,  Jackson\u2019s The Global Covenant, or \nHurrell\u2019s On Global Order\u2014to  cite five of the more accessible works of the \npost-1945 field dealing with themes dear to Woolf\u2019s heart. These works have \nelevated debate onto an altogether higher plane.12\n \nThe only other shortcoming in Glendinning\u2019s masterful account \nconcerns Woolf\u2019s anti-imperialism. Writing half a century after the event, \nWoolf presented his Ceylon years as a period during which the seeds of his \nanti-imperialism were firmly sown. He further claimed that growing doubt \nabout the imperial project that led him to resign from the Civil Service and \n 14\nreturn home. This account has been accepted by all subsequent students of \nLeonard Woolf\u2019s life and career, and is given further currency by Glendinning \n(and indeed Ondaatje). Yet in a very real sense Woolf\u2019s encounter with \nimperialism occurred not in Ceylon but in London. His growing anti-\nimperialism in Ceylon is a post hoc construction. There is no evidence in his \ndiaries to suggest that Woolf was seriously troubled by ethical doubts about \nempire during his time in Ceylon. On the contrary, the available evidence \nsuggests that romantic love not political aversion accounts overwhelmingly for \nhis decision to resign from the colonial service.  Resignation was the only \nroute open to him if he was to capture Virginia\u2019s hand in marriage. His anti-\nimperialism was not a product of raw experience but of later political \nconsciousness\u2014or rather, the heightening and radicalisation of his political \nconsciousness in suffragist, Fabian, and Labour circles in the 1910s and \n1920s. It was not the raw experience that led to the radicalisaton, but rather \nthe radicalisation that led him to reconstruct his experience of the previous \ndecade.  \n \nThe point is an important one because it shows how deeply entrenched \nin the decades that straddle the year 1900 was the notion that white men \nshould rule black men and that colonial empire would continue indefinitely. \nEven those like Woolf, who later became vociferous critics of empire\u2014\nBeatrice Webb described him as \u2018an anti-imperialist fanatic\u2019 (revealingly in \n1926, see Glendinning, p.265)\u2014accepted it in 1900 and even in 1910 as \nalmost a law of nature. A reified social structure if ever there was one!13\n \n 15\n Anti-Imperialist? \nWoolf arrived in Ceylon in November 1904 as a Cadet. In May 1907 he was \npromoted to Office Assistant, rising to AGA for Hambantota in August 1908. \nHis experiences as chief administrator and sole magistrate for this district of \n1,500 square kilometres provided much of the raw material for Village in the \nJungle.  He later described himself on arrival in Ceylon as \u2018a very innocent, \nunconscious imperialist\u2019 (Woolf, 1961, p.25). At the outset he felt \u2018rather \ngrand\u2019 being part of the \u2018ruling caste in a strange Asiatic country\u2019 \n(Glendinning, p.77).14 He never fitted into white society in Ceylon, a small \nculturally parochial group of administrators, traders and planters (and their \nbored or somewhat eccentric wives and daughters). In one typically over-the-\ntop letter to Lytton Stratchey he described them as \u2018the whole stupid degraded \ncircle of degenerates and imbeciles\u2019 (Glendinning, p.81; see also Ondaatje, \np.39).  Yet behind an authoritarian fa\u00e7ade\u2014necessary to make the system \nwork, he felt, in a largely uneducated and superstitious society\u2014he developed \na sympathy for and fascination with the native population: their litheness, \nstrangeness, fatalism, and the austerity, simplicity and serenity of the \nBuddhist faith.15 There is no question, however, that Woolf was ambitious\u2014\nindeed an ambitious imperialist. He prided himself on his efficiency, which \nbecame over time a \u2018dangerous passion\u2019, even a \u2018ruthless obsession\u2019 \n(Glendinning, p.107). He cultivated a \u2018strict but fair\u2019 official persona. He took \non new challenges with relish and had a supercilious attitude, a by-product of \nthe elitism of Trinity and the Apostles, towards all but his most capable \ncolleagues. Barron describes him as in some ways \u2018almost the archetypal \n 16\ncolonial administrator of the early twentieth century\u2019 (Baron, 1977, p.48). \nSpotts describes him as \u2018a model imperialist\u2019 (Woolf, 1990, p.58.) He was \nhard-working and wholly dedicated to advancement of the people he \ngoverned.16 He was quite sure in his own mind that he would have risen to \nhigh office had not something happened, in his evaluation of things, during his \nperiod of leave-of-absence, 1911-12. \n \nThat something was almost certainly Virginia. True, he was involved in \na number of incidents that may have made him think again about his role as a \ncolonial administrator and the merits and demerits of a colonial career. While \nserving in the north of the island in the early years of his career he was the \nsubject of several complaints from the Jaffna Tamil Association who accused \nhim of humiliating certain of its members. While no doubt guilty of a certain \ndegree of cultural insensitivity in these early years (applying rules strictly \nwithout reference to caste and other cultural peculiarities), he flatly denied the \nmost serious allegation: that of flicking with his riding whip the well-known \nTamil lawyer, Harry Sanderasekera. According to Glendinning, \u2018these \nincidents shook Leonard\u2019s confidence and made him seriously doubt whether \nhe wanted to rule over other people\u2019 (Glendinning, p.95; see also Ondaatje, \npp.104-6). In addition, during his tenure as AGA Woolf had a few scrapes with \nhis superiors. On one occasion he came close to being reported to Colombo \nby his immediate superior, the Government Agent (GA) of Southern Province, \nfor being over-zealous in his desire to innovate and over-critical of \ngovernment policy (Glendinning, p.107). It is not clear in Gendenning\u2019s \naccount whether the GA\u2019s pique was due to jealousy at Woolf\u2019s administrative \n 17\nsuccess (in 1910 he broke all previous records for salt collection\u2014a staple \neconomic activity in Hambantota17), concern that Woolf\u2019s uncompromising \nmethods were unsettling the natives, or dislike of his somewhat supercilious \nmanner. In 1911 Woolf received a reprimand from the Governor (albeit \nindirectly) concerning the nature and tone of some of his diary entries \nconcerning the GA and official policy. Woolf also suffered from chronic \nmalaria, which would have further sapped his enthusiasm for the East. In \nGlendinning\u2019s estimation, however, Woolf\u2019s doubts about his future as a \ncolonial civil servant were not due to these scrapes and setbacks \u2018but \nbecause he had lost all faith in the imperial project\u2019 (Glendinning, p.123). \n \nThe problem with this view is that it relies entirely on Woolf\u2019s \nautobiographical judgment reached long after the event and after much anti-\nimperial water had flowed under the bridge. Glendinning offers no evidence by \nway of corroboration from government documents, or from Woolf\u2019s official \ndiaries18, or from his letters, that at any point before he resigned he had \u2018lost \nall faith in the imperial project\u2019. Indeed the independent evidence she \nproduces suggests an altogether more conventional explanation. His letters to \nLytton Strachey indicate that from 1909 (i.e. on the eve of turning thirty) his \npersonal future began to play heavily on his mind. His sense of separation \nfrom those he conceived as his own kind grew ever-more acute\u2014he spoke of \n\u2018not having talked to anyone for four years\u2019 (Glendinning, p.114). He began to \nsee marriage as a way out of his own loneliness and unhappiness. In 1909 he \nhad wrote to Strachey that \u2018marriage is the only way to happiness, to anything \nsettled\u2018 (Glendinning, p.120). Indeed, he came close the following year to \n 18\nproposing to the daughter of a tea-planter. But the idea of marrying Virginia \nStephen, first put in Woolf\u2019s mind by Strachey during this time, became more \nand more attractive. There was no doubt some colonial disenchantment, but \nthe evidence suggests that the chief goal of Woolf\u2019s period of leave was to \nacquire a wife, and if at all possible Virginia.  \n \nIn seeking to culturally rehabilitate Leonard Woolf and elevate his \nsocio-political significance, it is convenient to present him a perspicacious \ndoubter of the merits of imperialism, as someone well ahead of the tide of \nmoral sentiments. But his first major assault on what he sarcastically called \n(after the Berlin Congress of 1878) the \u2018blessings of empire\u2019 came not in 1910 \nor 1911 but in 1920, a full nine years after his brother Edgar had introduced \nhim to the Webbs and Fabian socialism (Glendinning, p.128)\u2014which in my \nview marks the real beginning of his political education. In this connection it is \nimportant to note that The Village in the Jungle is far from an anti-imperialist \ntext. Glendinning asks the right question about this book: \u2018is at an anti-\nimperialist or a paternalistic and imperialist text?\u2019 (Glendinning, p.165), but \nleans strongly toward the former. It is worth recalling, however, that the main \nwhite character (one of only two) in the novel, the police magistrate\u2014the \n\u2018white Hamadoru\u2019 (which the author modelled on himself and his own \nexperiences)\u2014is positively portrayed. Yes, self-absorbed and arrogant; but \nalso sympathetic, reasonable, humane. His authority is portrayed as \nstemming more from superior knowledge (including knowledge of the jungle) \nthan from raw power. He is also portrayed as contemplative and even \nmentally courageous\u2014finding himself compelled by his training and values to \n 19\nlook beyond the bare facts of a homicide to the psychological motives and \ncircumstances of the accused (Woolf, 1981 [1913], 110-24, 136-47). The \njungle is depicted as savage, ominous, cruel and unrelenting, a metaphor \nalmost for the irrational forces in life.19 The headmen (Ratemahatmayas), \nvillage headmen (Arachchi), and traders and money-lenders (Mudalali) are \ngenerally depicted as self-interested, duplicitous, cunning and corrupt. The \npeasant villagers, relying on the \u2018chena\u2019 slash and burn cultivation, are \nrepresented as simple, gullible, superstitious, ignorant, powerless\u2014and \ncapable, like wild animals, of terrible acts when cornered. The point here is \nthat the most appealing characters in the book, the only ones displaying \nwisdom and compassion, are Europeans\u2014a fact which hardly bears out the \nclaim that the novel is anti-imperialistic. For sure, the central protagonist, \nSilindu, displays a certain nobility in the way he accepts his fate (hanging, \nprobably, for the cold-blooded murder of his tormentors), and Woolf enlists \nfrom the reader a good deal of sympathy for him. But in essence he is a \nwretched creature enslaved by his ignorance. \n \nTwo things should be added. First, the element of paternalism is strong \nin virtually all Woolf\u2019s writings about the colonial world. P. S. Gupta has noted \nthat Woolf\u2019s paternalism towards \u2018backward peoples\u2019, \u2018non-adult races\u2019 and \n\u2019primitive peoples\u2019 (terms all of which Woolf liberally used) long outlived its \nusefulness and never entirely lost a certain racial tinge (Gupta, 1975, pp.276-\n8).20 This is why even beyond the publication of Empire and Commerce in \nAfrica and his other reputedly \u2018anti-imperialist\u2019 writings one feels uneasy \ndescribing him as an anti-imperialist. Woolf wanted change, and by the 1920s \n 20\nbecame a proponent of the acceleration of efforts to prepare subject peoples \nfor self-government. But he never abandoned the liberal imperialist belief that \nsuperior peoples had a duty to aid the development\u2014social, economic, \npolitical and moral\u2014of inferior peoples, and that advancement would take \nplace within established (if reformed) imperial political and administrative \nstructures. Baron is not quite right to say that Woolf \u2018behaved impeccably as a \ncolonial official\u2019, but he is right in saying that the characteristic outlook of the \nservice\u2014the government of less advanced peoples for their own good\u2014was \n\u2018driven deep into his consciousness and survived their till his death\u2019 (Baron, \n1977, p.49). To the extent that he rejected imperialism he did so not on \npolitical or ethical grounds but on aesthetic: \nThe aesthetic repudiation of imperialism, the belief that white men lived \nat best unreal, theatrical lives, at worst alienated, grotesque lives in \nCeylon, whereas the Sinhalese, Tamils, Moors were totally in harmony \nwith their environment, is a clear and persistent theme in all Woolf\u2019s \nwritings on the East\u2026(Baron, 1977, p.54; see also Ondaatje, pp.36-7). \n \nSecondly, returning to narrower ground, the fact that Woolf got to work on this \nnovel so soon after leaving the Colonial Service supports the further thesis \nthat he resigned in order \u2018to devote his time in the United Kingdom to the \nliterary pursuits which had been his main interest from his undergraduate \ndays at Cambridge\u2019.21 I have no wish here to support any mono-causal \naccount of Woolf\u2019s decision. Any life-changing decision involves a variety of \nfactors and motives. The point of the foregoing is simply to cast some critical \nlight on the dominant, in some respects convenient, (and Leonard Woolf\u2019s \nown) explanation. \n \n \n 21\n Conclusion: Disillusioned Imperialist \nThe only safe conclusion, on the basis of the evidence presented in these \nvolumes, is that by 1910-11 Woolf had lost some faith in the imperial project. \nNo longer an unconscious imperialist, he was becoming a disillusioned \nimperialist. His disillusion was a product of his youthful enthusiasm and \nidealism. Far from rejecting the goals of imperialism (those of education and \nstewardship as enshrined in the most optimistic vision of empire) he was \ndisillusioned by the inefficiency and cynicism with which they were pursued. \nSuch bald statements as \u2018I resigned because I did not like being an imperialist \nand ruling people\u201922 do not ring true. They say more about Woolf\u2019s attitude \nand state of mind in the 1960s than in the 1900s\u2014and of course how he \nwished to be remembered. Glendinning notes in a typically perceptive \npassage that as he \u2018withdrew from political planning for the future [in the \n1940s] he ... became involved in the management of the past\u2019 (Glendinning, \np.402). This she applies to his relationship with the Webbs and especially to \nVirginia\u2019s legacy and reputation. Yet, curiously, she does not apply it to \nLeonard\u2019s writings about his own life and career which began with the \npublication in 1953 of Principia Politica\u2014a set of personal reflections and \nreminisces about political events and ideas rather than an attempt to identify \nthe principles of politics23\u2014and continued in earnest with the publication of \nthe first volume of his autobiography in 1960.  An area such as imperialism, \ngiven Leonard\u2019s previous involvement, and the near-revolutionary changes in \nattitudes towards it during his lifetime, would, one would think, be ripe for such \n\u2018management\u2019. \n 22\n                                                                                                                                            \n \nNotes \n \n1The seminal study of New Liberalism is Michael Freeden, Liberalism Divided: \nA Study in British Political Thought, 1914-1939 (Oxford: Oxford University \nPress, 1986).

It \nis the Hindustani name for revenue collection offices and is still widely used in \nSri Lanka to denote government offices.

See also Ondaatje, pp.282-8, whose account is much in line with \nGlendinning\u2019s. \n12 I sought to examine the conceptual, methodological and empirical \nweaknesses in Woolf\u2019s political thought in International Theory of Leonard \nWoolf, esp. chs. 4 & 6. For more upbeat assessments see Casper Sylvest, \n\u2018Interwar Internationalism, the British Labour Party, and the Historiography of \nInternational Relations\u2019, International Studies Quarterly 48, 2 (2004), esp. pp. \n422-28; and Lucian M. Ashworth, International Relations Theory and the \nLabour Party: Intellectuals and Policy Making, 1918-1945 (London: I.B. \nTauris, 2008), esp. ch.6. \n13 Note the verdict of Jan Morris on the British attitude to Empire in Jubilee \nyear (1897): \u2018The infatuated British people did not greatly concern itself with \n 24\n                                                                                                                                            \nthe motives of the Pax Britannica. It had happened. It was splendid. It was \npart of that divine order which had made Britain supreme and Victoria sixty \nyears a Queen\u2019 (quoted in Ondaatje, p.16). The relative permanence of the \nBritish Empire was taken for granted\u2014and not only by Tory diehards\u2014as late \nas the 1940s (see Wilson, International Theory of Leonard Woolf, pp.133-4). \nIn 1926, Woolf\u2019s friend on the fringe of Bloomsbury, Harold Nicolson, \nconfessed \u2018how gloriously and manfully imperial we are!\u2019 He declared the \nfollowing year that imperialism was part of Britain\u2019s \u2018national genius\u2019. By 1942, \nhowever, partly due to Woolf\u2019s influence, his views had changed. \u2018Imperialism \nis dead\u2026and, I hope, buried\u2019, he told the House of Commons. See Derek \nDrinkwater, Sir Harold Nicolson and International Relations: The Practitioner \nas Theorist (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp.63-4.  \n14 The Sinhalese, it should be noted, had a rigid caste-system which the \nBritish, like the Dutch and Portuguese before them, did little to disturb. On \narrival they simply planted themselves on top! \n15 The Buddhist veneration for a life of solitude and contemplation, according \nto Glendinning, \u2018chimed with [Woolf\u2019s] own dreams of withdrawal\u2019 (p.96; see \nalso Ondaatje, pp.162-4). He was not so enamoured with Hinduism and the \n\u2018multiplicity of its florid gods, the ugly exuberance of its temples\u2019 (p.96). On \nWoolf\u2019s regard for the various peoples of Sri Lanka\/Ceylon, including the Arab \npearl divers he encountered while serving in Jaffna, see, further, Baron, \n\u2018Before the Deluge\u2019, esp. pp. 52-4; Wilson, International Theory of Leonard \nWoolf, pp.112-13. \n16 He set out to make his district \u2018the most efficiently governed in the colony\u2026 \nHe was enthralled by the sheer challenge of the work. In devoting himself \n 25\n                                                                                                                                            \ncompletely to the welfare of his people, he was acting in the best tradition of \nBritish imperialism\u2019 (Spotts in Woolf, 1990, pp.58-9). In 1931 Beatrice Webb \ndescribed him as \u2018a saint with very considerable intelligence; a man without \nvanity or guile, wholly public-spirited\u2019. Quoted in Gendinning, p. 286. \n17 Ondaatje provides a nice overview, pp. 216-8. \n18 Spotts notes (in Woolf, 1990, pp.61-2) that Woolf makes only \u2018a few fugitive \npolitical comments\u2019 regarding Ceylon and imperialism in his letters. His \nconclusion that Woolf was beginning to doubt the moral legitimacy of empire \nrelies, as with Glendinning, on Woolf\u2019s autobiographical assertions. I tend to \nagree with Feuer (though not with his somewhat speculative psychoanalytical \nframework), that Woolf\u2019s \u2018abrupt metamorphosis into an anti-imperialist was \nnot the outcome of his own imperialist experiences or the consequence of a \nconviction that he had been doing the devil\u2019s work.\u2019 Rather it was the outcome \nof a new psychological (and for Feuer, sexual) dynamic triggered by his \nrenewed intimacy with his Cambridge friends, his relationship with Virginia, \nand his immersion in radical politics. See Lewis S. Feuer, Imperialism and the \nAnti-Imperialist Mind (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 1986), pp. \n154-9.  This important work is not cited by either Ondaatje or Glndinning, \n19 Woolf stated in his autobiography that \u2018the jungle and jungle life are \n\u2026horribly ugly and cruel. When I left Ceylon, and wrote The Village in the \nJungle, that was what obsessed my memory and my imagination and is, in a \nsense, the theme of the book (Woolf, 1961, p.212). Ondaatje quotes this \npassage (p.243) but it does not sit comfortably with his prior verdict that \nVillage is \u2018undoubtedly anti-imperialist\u2019 (p.239). Ondaatje provides a valuable \nanalysis of Woolf\u2019s fiction works (pp.235-61), which mentions but does little to \n 26\n                                                                                                                                            \nrefute Rajiva Wijesinha\u2019s verdict (see p.254) that Village is patronising and \npaternalistic. \n20 See also Wilson, 2003, pp.134-5. The fascinating relationship between \npaternalism and internationalism in early twentieth century political thought is \nexplored by several contributors to David Long and Brian Schmidt (eds.), \nImperialism and Internationalism in the Discipline of International Relations \n(New York: SUNY Press, 2005). \n21 \u2018S.D.S.\u2019, \u2018Introduction Part I\u2019, Diaries in Ceylon, p. xxxv. \n22 Quoted from the Ceylon Observer (6 March 1960) in ibid. fn. 18, p.xix. See \nalso Woolf, The Journey Not the Arrival Matters, pp.205-8, and Ondaatje \npp.274-5. \n23 The book was prominently reviewed, Bertrand Russell, A. J. P. Taylor, Max \nBeloff, and E. H. Carr among the reviewers. But unlike the first two volumes \n(Leonard conceived it as Part III of his After the Deluge) the reception was \nhostile. The Oxford philosopher, Stuart Hampshire, hit the nail on the head in \ndescribing Woolf as straying \u2018through the domains of child psychology, animal \npsychology, anthropology and classical scholarship with the lightest possible \nequipment and with little reference to any detailed research.\u2019 See \nGlendinning, pp. 412-6. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 27\n                                                                                                                                            \nReferences \nAdamson, J.
