Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to study Hopf bifurcation from\nviscous shock waves. While Hopf bifurcations from equilibria are well understood in\nordinary di\ufb00erential equations (ODEs) and in dissipative partial di\ufb00erential equations\n(PDEs) on bounded domains, a variety of new phenomena and di\ufb03culties arise when\nstudying Hopf bifurcations for PDEs on unbounded domains.\nIn particular, Hopf bifurcations from travelling waves are complicated by the\npresence of a neutral mode at the origin which is induced by spatial translation.\nIf the essential spectrum of the linearization around the travelling wave is bounded\naway from the imaginary axis, appropriate center-manifold reductions and equivari-\nant parametrizations as in [4, 6, 17] show that the bifurcation problem reduces to a\nstandard Hopf bifurcation, and standard results on bifurcation and exchange of sta-\nbility [2] immediately carry over to this setting [15, section 2]; the only e\ufb00ect of the\ntranslation mode is an adjustment of the wave speed. When the Hopf instability is\ncaused by essential spectrum that crosses the imaginary axis, a variety of interesting\nnew phenomena can occur, including failure of bifurcation [15] and bifurcation of mul-\ntiple solution branches [16, section 2.3]. The situation becomes more involved when\nthe instability caused by the essential spectrum is stationary, as the wave will then\ntypically decay only algebraically at onset which leads to signi\ufb01cant complications in\nthe analysis [16, sections 2.1, 2.2, and 3].\nFrom the preceding list, one can easily envision yet another possible scenario\nwhere the complex Hopf eigenvalues belong to the point spectrum, whilst the transla-\ntion mode is embedded in the continuous spectrum. This situation arises, for instance,\nwhen the primary wave is not spatially localized, but the Hopf eigenfunctions are lo-\ncalized: Examples are Hopf bifurcations from coherent structures such as sources and\nsinks in one spatial dimension, and spiral waves in two dimensions. A model problem\nin higher space dimensions, but with a space-dependent potential, has recently been\nanalyzed in [1]. Viscous shock waves provide another prominent example where the\ntranslation mode is embedded into the continuous spectrum. In fact, conservation\n\u2217Received by the editors November 21, 2006; accepted for publication (in revised form) September\n25, 2007; published electronically March 21, 2008.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/sima\/39-6\/67558.html\n\u2020Department of Mathematics, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 7XH, UK (b.sandstede@\nsurrey.ac.uk).

Our paper is strongly motivated\nby recent work of Texier and Zumbrun [19, 20] in which they analyzed oscillatory\ninstabilities of viscous shocks using delicate estimates for the temporal period map of\nthe linearized semigroup. Texier and Zumbrun proved the existence of a continuous\nbranch of oscillatory viscous shocks with a 1\/x decay estimate at spatial in\ufb01nity. In\na personal communication, Zumbrun asked us whether spatial-dynamics techniques\ncan be used to obtain the same or stronger results than those in [19, 20]. We demon-\nstrate here that the spatial-dynamics approach yields indeed sharper results, while\nsimplifying the analysis and adding geometric insight into the problem: We show\nthat the bifurcating oscillatory shocks are unique, exponentially localized, and de-\npend smoothly on the bifurcation parameter, and we calculate the spectra of the\nlinearization about the bifurcating oscillating shock waves, thereby con\ufb01rming the\nexpected exchange of stability. Instead of analyzing the temporal semigroup whose\nlinearization has essential spectrum up to the imaginary axis, we consider the spatial\nevolution of temporally periodic functions for which we gain compactness of the resol-\nvent due to the imposed time periodicity. While this method may appear nonintuitive,\nit is completely analogous to the usual phase-plane analysis used to prove existence\nof viscous shocks and to study their stationary bifurcations. After this paper was\ncompleted, Texier and Zumbrun were able to extend their approach to prove in [21]\nexponential localization of the bifurcating solutions for compressible Navier\u2013Stokes\nand magnetohydrodynamics.\nOutline. In section 2, we state our main result on bifurcation and spectral stability\nof modulated shocks. The bifurcation result is proved in section 3. In section 4, we\nreview the precise characterization of spectra and prove stability and instability in the\ncase of super- and subcritical bifurcations, respectively. We conclude with a discussion\nof several extensions and generalizations in section 5.\n2. Setup and main results. Consider the viscous conservation law\nut + f(u)y = uyy, y \u2208 R, u \u2208 Rn,(2.1)\nwhere f is a smooth \ufb02ux function.

If u\n\u03b5\n\u00b1 are smooth curves\nthat depend on a real parameter \u03b5 \u2248 0, then we \ufb01nd a smooth family of Lax shocks\nq\u03b5(x) with a smooth speed relation c = c\u03b5 given by the Rankine\u2013Hugoniot condition.\nSince the eigenvalues of fu(u) are the characteristic speeds of propagation at u, the\ncondition on the dimensions of W\u02dc s,u\u00b1 merely states that p+1 characteristics enter the\nshock from the left and n\u2212 p characteristics enter from the right.\nWe are interested in the scenario where the Lax shocks undergo a Hopf instability\nupon increasing \u03b5 through zero. We therefore consider the linearization at the shock\nwhich is given by the linear operator\nL\u03b5 := \u2202x [\u2202x + c\u03b5 \u2212 fu(q\u03b5(x))] ,\nwhich we view as a closed unbounded operator on L2(R,Rn). Its essential spectrum\nis readily seen to be contained in the closed left half-plane, touching the imaginary\naxis only at the origin with a quadratic tangency. We assume that the point spectrum\nlies in the open left half-plane, bounded away from the imaginary axis, except for an\nisolated pair \u03bb(\u03b5) and \u03bb(\u03b5) of simple complex eigenvalues with\n\u03bb(0) = i\u03c90 \u0005= 0, Re\u03bb\u03b5(0) > 0.(2.5)\nTheorem 2.1 (bifurcation).

Furthermore, any non-\nstationary time-periodic solution u(x, t) of (2.2), which is pointwise close to q0(x)\nand converges to u\u03b5\u00b1 as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e, is in fact an appropriate space and time translation\nof u\u2217.\nNote that u\u2217(x, t; a) and q\u03b5(a)(x) have the same asymptotic rest states and travel\nwith the same (average) wave speed. Theorem 2.1 remains true if f = f(u; \u03b5) depends\nsmoothly on the parameter \u03b5.\nSpectral stability of the modulated shocks u\u2217(x, t; a) is determined by the Floquet\nspectrum\n\u03a3 = {\u03bb \u2208 C; e\u03bbT \u2208 spectrum of \u03a6T },\nwhere T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9 is the temporal period of u\u2217, and \u03a6t is the evolution operator of the\nlinearization\nvt = \u2202x[\u2202x + c\n\u03b5(a) \u2212 fu(u\u2217(x, t; a))]v\nof (2.2) about u\u2217 on L2 or C0unif .\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 by SIAM.

Existence of modulated viscous shocks. In this section, we prove Theo-\nrem 2.1.\n3.1. Preparations. We begin by collecting some properties of the linearization\nL\u03b5 = \u2202x [\u2202x + c\u03b5 \u2212 fu(q\u03b5(x))]\nabout the viscous shocks that we need later on. Since we assumed in (2.5) that the\nHopf eigenvalues \u03bb(0) = i\u03c90 \u0005= 0 and \u03bb(0) of L0 are simple, we know that there are\nnonzero L2-functions vj and \u03c8j for j = 1, 2 that form a basis of the eigenspaces of\nL0 and its adjoint [L0]\u2217, respectively, associated with these Hopf eigenvalues. We can\nchoose these functions so that\n\u3008\u03c8i, vj\u3009L2 = \u3008\u03c8i, \u03c8j\u3009L2 = \u03b4ij ,(3.1)\nL0v1 = \u2212\u03c90v2, L0v2 = \u03c90v1.\nThe result [10, Theorem 5.4 in Chapter II] gives the characterization\nRe\u03bb\u03b5(0) =\n1\n2\n2\u2211\nj=1\n\u3008\u03c8j , \u2202\u03b5L\u03b5|\u03b5=0vj\u3009L2(3.2)\nof the derivative Re\u03bb\u03b5(0) which we assumed in (2.5) to be positive.\n3.2.

The space Y is natural for various reasons: First, we wish to work on\nspaces of time-periodic functions and shall see later in (3.13), see also [13, section\n3], that the spaces Hs+1\/2(S1) \u00d7 Hs(S1) for s \u2265 0 are the only spaces compatible\nwith the linear leading-order part of (3.3). We choose s = 1\/2 since H1(S1) embeds\ninto C0(S1) which guarantees that the nonlinearity fu(u) in (3.3) is well de\ufb01ned and\ndi\ufb00erentiable on Y . Finally, we remark that we shall often use, for convenience, the\nscalar product\n\u3008U, V \u3009X := 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n\u3008U(\u03c4), V (\u03c4)\u3009R2n d\u03c4\nof the space X = L2(S1)\u00d7 L2(S1) to de\ufb01ne complements and compute adjoints; this\nscalar product is also an inner product on Y as Y embeds continuously into X.\nThe system (3.3) is invariant under the S1-action\n\u0393 : S1 \u2212\u2192 L(Y, Y ), \u03c3 \u0007\u2212\u2192 \u0393\u03c3, [\u0393\u03c3U ](\u03c4) = U(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3).(3.4)\nWe record that the \ufb01xed-point space Fix \u0393 \u223c= Rn\u00d7Rn of this action consists precisely\nof all time-independent functions, and (3.3) restricted to Fix \u0393 becomes the usual\ntravelling-wave ODE (\nux\nvx\n)\n=\n(\nv\nfu(u)v \u2212 cv\n)\n(3.5)\nwhich is equivalent to (2.3). Equation (3.5) possesses the equilibria Ueq = (u, 0) for\nu \u2208 Rn and the heteroclinic orbits Q\u03b5(x) := (q\u03b5, q\u03b5x)(x) for c = c\u03b5: Q\u03b5(x) connects\nU\u2212eq(\u03b5) = (u\n\u03b5\n\u2212, 0) to U\n+\neq(\u03b5) = (u\n\u03b5\n+, 0) with\nTQ\u03b5(x)W\nu\n\u2212 + TQ\u03b5(x)W\ncs\n+ = R\n2n,(3.6)\nwhere W j\u00b1 := W\nj(U\u00b1eq(\u03b5)). The transversality of the intersection in (3.6) is a con-\nsequence of the following dimension count for \u03b5 = 0. Since dimW u\u2212 = p + 1 and\ndimW cs+ = 2n \u2212 p, it su\ufb03ces to show that the only nontrivial elements in the in-\ntersection of the tangent spaces are multiples of Q0x(x).

The characterization of Ecs+ and E\nu\n\u2212 is a consequence of the existence of\nexponential dichotomies on Yh and the dynamics of the travelling-wave ODE (3.5).\nFirst, recall that the dynamics on the Fourier subspaces Yk decouple, so that we can\nwrite\nEcs+ =\n\u2295\nk\u2208Z\n(Ecs+ \u2229 Yk), Eu\u2212 =\n\u2295\nk\u2208Z\n(Eu\u2212 \u2229 Yk).\nWe know that the strong unstable manifoldW u(U\u2212eq(0)) and the center-stable manifold\nW cs(U+eq(0)) of (3.5) intersect transversely along Q\n0(x); see (3.6). Thus,\nspanQ0x(0) = E\ncs\n+ \u2229 Eu\u2212 \u2229 Y0.\nNext, V0 \u2208 Yh, the subspace of nonzero Fourier modes k \u0005= 0, lies in Ecs+ \u2229 Eu\u2212 if\nand only if V (x) satis\ufb01es (3.11) on R with V (x) \u2192 0 exponentially as |x| \u2192 \u221e.\nSince (3.11) on Y decouples, we \ufb01nd that such a solution can be taken in the form\nV (x) = eik\u03c4 (v, vx)(x) for some integer k \u0005= 0.

Using\nthe relation between (3.18) and [L0]\u2217, we conclude that (3.15) is met.\nNote that the direction Q0x(0) \u2208 Ecs+ \u2229 Eu\u2212 corresponds to the \ufb02ow direction. To\nremove it, we shall later use the hyperplane\nS := [RQ0x(0)]\u22a5 \u2282 Y.(3.19)\nWe are now ready to discuss the nonlinear equation (3.3) near the orbit Q0(x) for \u03c9\nclose to \u03c90 and \u03b5 close to zero. It is convenient to set\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 +\u03a9\nand to consider (\nux\nvx\n)\n=\n(\nv\n(\u03c90 +\u03a9)\u2202\u03c4u+ fu(u)v \u2212 c\u03b5v\n)\n(3.20)\nnear the orbit Q0 = (q0, q0x) for (\u03b5,\u03a9) close to zero.

We use Lyapunov\u2013Schmidt\nreduction to determine the intersection (3.22).

This section is\ndevoted to the proof of Theorem 2.2. Our goal is to determine the Floquet spectrum\n\u03a3 = {\u03bb \u2208 C; e2\u03c0\u03bb \u2208 spectrum of \u03a62\u03c0}\nassociated with the evolution \u03a6t of the linearization\n\u03c9v\u03c4 = \u2202x[\u2202x + c\u2212 fu(q\u2217(x, \u03c4 ; a))]v\nof (2.2) about q\u2217 on C0unif . Note that (\u03b5, \u03c9) and q\u2217 depend smoothly on the parameter\na introduced in section 3, and so do the wave speed c = c\u03b5 and the asymptotic rest\nstates u\u03b5\u00b1 through \u03b5 = \u03b5\u2217(a); we will suppress this dependence for most of the proof.\nThe Floquet spectrum \u03a3 is the disjoint union of the essential spectrum \u03a3ess and\nthe point spectrum \u03a3pt, which consists, by de\ufb01nition, of all isolated eigenvalues with\n\ufb01nite multiplicity. Since the modulated shock q\u2217(x, \u03c4 ; a) converges exponentially to\nthe constants u\u03b5\u00b1 as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e, uniformly in \u03c4 , the set \u03a3ess is bounded to the right by\nthe essential spectra\n\u03a3\u00b1ess = {\u03bb \u2208 C; det(k2 + ik[fu(u\u03b5\u00b1)\u2212 c\u03b5] + \u03bb) = 0 for some k \u2208 R}\nof u\u03b5\u00b1 (see, for instance, [14, Proposition 2.10]), which touch the imaginary axis at\n\u03bb = 0 and lie otherwise in the open left half-plane due to our hypothesis that the\neigenvalues of fu(u\n\u03b5\n\u00b1) are real and simple.\nIt therefore su\ufb03ces to locate point spectrum, that is, isolated Floquet exponents\n\u03bb which are captured, via the ansatz v(x, \u03c4) = e\u03bb\u03c4u(x, \u03c4) with u(x, \u03c4 + 2\u03c0) = u(x, \u03c4)\nfor all \u03c4 , by the equation\n\u03c9\u2217(a)u\u03c4 + \u03bbu = \u2202x[\u2202x + c\u03b5\u2217(a) \u2212 fu(q\u2217(x, \u03c4 ; a))]u\nwhich we rewrite as\nVx =\n(\n0 1\n\u03c9\u2202\u03c4 + \u03bb+ fuu(q\n\u2217)[q\u2217x, \u00b7] fu(q\u2217)\u2212 c\n)\nV\n= [FU (Q\n\u2217(x; a), \u000f\u2217(a),\u03a9\u2217(a)) + \u03bbB]V, V \u2208 Y,(4.1)\nwith Q\u2217(x; a) = (q\u2217, q\u2217x)(x, \u00b7; a) from (3.35).\nSince we assumed spectral stability for \u000f = 0 except for the Hopf eigenvalues\nand the translational eigenvalue at the origin (which all contribute to the Floquet\nexponent \u03bb = 0), it su\ufb03ces to \ufb01nd all isolated Floquet exponents of (4.1) in a \ufb01xed\nsmall neighborhood of the origin. We choose an open set \u03a9 \u2282 C as indicated in\nFigure 2. Standard theory implies that \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9 is a Floquet exponent if and only if\n(4.1) has a nontrivial exponentially decaying solution on R.

For \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9, the unstable eigenspace E\u221e\u2212 (\u03bb, a) at x = \u2212\u221e and the\nstable eigenspace E\u221e+ (\u03bb, a) at x =\u221e are therefore given by\nE\u221e+ := E\ns\n+ \u2295R+, E\u221e\u2212 := Eu\u2212 \u2295R\u2212, R\u00b1 = span{R\u00b1j ; \u03bd\u00b1j \u2277 0},\nand these spaces depend smoothly on a and are analytic in \u03bb for \u03bb near zero. Note\nthat dimR+ = p and dimR\u2212 = n\u2212 p\u2212 1 with p as in section 2.\nLemma 4.1. There are unique closed subspaces E\u00b1(\u03bb, a) of Y , de\ufb01ned and an-\nalytic in \u03bb near zero and smooth in a \u2265 0, such that V (x) is a bounded solution of\n(4.1) on R\u00b1 for some \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9 if and only if V (0) \u2208 E\u00b1(\u03bb, a).\nProof. We begin by considering (4.1) with Q\u2217 replaced by Q\u03b5. In this case, (4.1)\ndecouples on each Fourier space Yk, and the claimed statement holds for Q\n\u03b5 due to\nthe Gap lemma [5, 9] applied in Y0 and exponential dichotomy theory together with\nestimates as in [13, Lemma 3.3] in the other Fourier spaces. Since the di\ufb00erence of Q\u03b5\nand Q\u2217 is small for all x and decays to zero exponentially as |x| \u2192 \u221e, these results\ncarry over to (4.1) using, for instance, the integral formulation in [12, (4.12) in section\n4.3]; see also [18, section 7.6] for a slightly di\ufb00erent proof.\nLemma 4.1 shows that Floquet exponents in \u03a9 can be found by seeking nontrivial\nintersections of E\u2212(\u03bb, a) and E+(\u03bb, a). To determine their intersections, we \ufb01rst set\n(\u03bb, a) = 0 to see what these spaces look like at onset and then use perturbation theory\nto analyze the case when (\u03bb, a) \u0005= 0.\nHence, let \u03bb = 0, then (4.1) is simply the variational equation\nVx = FU (Q\n\u2217(x; a), \u000f\u2217(a),\u03a9\u2217(a))V, V \u2208 Y,(4.4)\nof the modulated wave Q\u2217. When a = 0, we have Q\u2217 = Q0, and (4.4) describes\nFloquet exponents at \u03bb = 0 of the unperturbed viscous shock q0. In particular, (4.4)\ndecouples on each Fourier space Yk, and our hypotheses on the Evans function and\nthe spectral properties of the viscous shock imply that\nE+(0, 0) \u2229 E\u2212(0, 0) = span{Q0x(0), V1(0), V2(0)},\n(4.5)\n[E+(0, 0) + E\u2212(0, 0)]\u22a5 = span{\u03a80,\u03a81(0),\u03a82(0)}\nfor an appropriate nonzero vector \u03a80 \u2208 Y0.

Our hypothesis that \u03bb = 0 is a simple zero of\nthe Evans function of the viscous shock at \u03b5 = 0 implies that M0 \u0005= 0.\nNext, we set \u03bb = 0 and compute derivatives with respect to a. Since \u03bb = 0,\nthe eigenvalue problem reduces to the variational equation (4.4). In particular, both\n\u2202xQ\n\u2217(x; a) and \u2202\u03c4 Q\u02dc\u2217(x; a) are solutions of (4.4) that satisfy (4.14), and we can set\nb0 = b2 = 0 as they make no contribution to D(0, a). We focus therefore on V \u00b1(x) =\nV1(x) + V\u02dc\n\u00b1(x; 0, a) for which (4.9) and (4.14) together imply\n\u3008\u03a8\u22170(0; a), V +(0)\u2212 V \u2212(0)\u3009X = 0(4.15)\nfor all a.

Discussion. There are numerous possible generalizations and extensions of\nour results. The crucial ingredient is the existence of the evolution operators \u03a6s,u\u00b1\nfor the spatial dynamical system, which requires some hyperbolicity in the spatial\ndynamics. The results are clearly not dependent on the particular form of the viscosity\nmatrix: nonlinear viscosity B(u)uxx is allowed as long as the essential spectrum is\nnonresonant with the Hopf eigenvalue (uniform positivity is typically su\ufb03cient). We\ncan also allow parameter-dependent \ufb02uxes: the parameter \u03b5 may appear explicitly in\nthe viscosity matrix and the \ufb02ux f = f(u; \u03b5).\nUnder- and overcompressive shocks can be treated similarly.

To set up the problem, we can, for\ninstance, prescribe the values of u on ingoing characteristics. Choose manifolds S\u00b1 of\nR\nn so that Tu0\u00b1S\u00b1 \u2295 I\u00b1 = Rn, where I\u00b1 is the eigenspace belonging to eigenvalues\n\u03bd\u00b1 \u2276 0 of fu(u0\u00b1) \u2212 c0. We then seek viscous shock waves in the intersection of\nWu(S\u2212) and Ws(S+), where we regard S\u00b1 as subsets of the manifold Rn \u00d7 {0} \u2282 Y0\nof equilibria of (5.1). Both manifolds are n-dimensional, and we will assume that their\nintersection along the viscous shock is transverse in the parameter c; this is equivalent\nto the assumption that \u03bb = 0 is a simple root of the Evans function associated with the\nPDE linearization at the shock [5, 8, 23]. One can now vary S\u00b1 = S\u03b5\u00b1 and continue the\ntransverse intersection provided the speed c = c\u03b5 is adjusted appropriately. If a pair\nof complex eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis at \u03b5 = 0, the analysis in this paper\ncan be adapted easily to show that there is a unique family of oscillatory under-\nor overcompressive shocks bifurcating from the primary viscous shock. As for Lax\nshocks, the bifurcating oscillatory shocks converge exponentially to time-independent\nrest states as |x| \u2192 \u221e due to the presence of the n conservation laws (3.36). We\nremark that undercompressive shocks occur as weak denotations in combustion, which\nmakes them interesting from an applied viewpoint.\nThe analysis extends also to the case of degenerate shock waves, where we allow\nfor an additional center direction within the travelling-wave ODE in Fix \u0393 at either\nu0\u2212 or u\n0\n+. Again, suitable transversality conditions on the intersections of Wu\u2212 and\nWs+ together with appropriate assumptions on the nonlinear behavior of the zero\ncharacteristic speed near the shock are needed.\nProblems posed in in\ufb01nite cylinders,\nut = \u0394u+\n\u2211\nj\n\u2202xjfj(u), x \u2208 R\u00d7 \u03a9,\nfor bounded cross sections \u03a9 \u2282 RN and with Neumann boundary conditions on R\u00d7\u2202\u03a9,\nsay, can also be treated. The existence of exponential dichotomies for this problem\nfollows from [11, 14].\nThe major open problem that we did not address in this paper is nonlinear sta-\nbility of the bifurcating oscillatory viscous shocks. It should be possible to establish\nnonlinear stability using a combination of the approach via pointwise estimates de-\nveloped by Howard and Zumbrun in [8, 23] and our spatial-dynamics technique which\ncan be used to obtain the necessary estimates for the Green\u2019s function; this will be\npursued elsewhere.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.
