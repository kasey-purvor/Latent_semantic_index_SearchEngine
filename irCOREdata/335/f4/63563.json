For example, it controls the transport and fate of heavy metals, \naluminium, radionuclides and organic pollutants, initiates photoreactions, participates in \nparticle surface and colloid chemistry, and affects ionic balance, including pH.  Quantitative \ndescriptions of these functional properties are needed for ecology, geochemistry, and to \nunderstand and predict the toxicity and fate of pollutants.  The need for such descriptions is \ngiven extra impetus by the apparent sensitivity of DOM to environmental change, as shown \nby long-term increases (Hongve et al., 2004; Evans et al., 2005) or decreases (Schindler et al., \n1996) in DOM concentration, and changes in DOM quality (Curtis, 1998; Donahue et al. \n1998), attributed to climatic warming and\/or declining acid deposition.  \nKnowledge about the functional properties of DOM has been obtained largely from \nlaboratory experiments with isolated fractions, especially humic and fulvic acids, from \ndifferent natural environments, and obtained by different methods.  Inevitably the data \nobtained are not systematic, which makes it difficult to apply the available knowledge to field \nsituations.  Given that freshwater DOM molecular structure, composition, and size are \nconsidered to vary considerably, depending upon (i) source material (Malcolm, 1990; Curtis, \n1998), (ii) differential retention during passage through soils (Kaiser et al., 2002), and (iii) \nmodification in the freshwater system, notably by photolysis (Waiser and Robarts, 2000), it \nseems inevitable that functional properties will vary as well.  However, at present we cannot \nreadily relate DOM function to structure.  \nTo address the issue of functional variability in DOM directly, Thacker et al. (2005) \ndeveloped standardised assays, that can be applied to DOM isolates in order to quantify \nvariability in the functional properties of DOM.  The 11 assays, together with one additional \nassay, are summarised in Table 1.  In each case, solutions of isolated DOM are prepared under \nstandardised conditions, and a functional property is measured.  A key feature of the approach \nis the use of a quality control standard (Suwannee River Fulvic Acid, SRFA) which is \nanalysed alongside each DOM sample.  The assays of optical absorbance (1, 2 and 12) \ncharacterise the effect of DOC on light penetration of surface waters, while determinations of \nphotodecomposition (assay 4) and fluorescence (assay 3) are relevant to photochemical \nactivity.  Assays 5, 6 and 7 quantify interactions of DOM with other solutes, and are relevant \nto natural water chemistry and the transport and bioavailability of essential and potentially-\n 3 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 4 \ntoxic metals and hydrophobic organic contaminants.  The hydrophilicity assays (8 and 9) are \nrelevant to aggregation, and sorption processes involving cells and mineral surfaces, while the \nadsorption assays (10 and 11) deal directly with mineral adsorption. \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \nIn lakes, two sources of DOM can broadly be distinguished.  Allochthonous DOM \n(DOMALL) originates from the catchment, mainly through the decay of terrestrial plant \nmaterial and subsequent leaching of partial decomposition products.  Autochthonous DOM \n(DOMAUT) is produced within the lake itself.  Thomas (1997) identified three main sources of \nDOMAUT; (i) sloppy feeding or excretion by living organisms (bacteria, phytoplankton, \ninvertebrates and fish); (ii) bacterial degradation of dead particulate organic matter (in \nepilimnion, hypolimnion and sediment); (iii) abiotic polymerisation and degradation. \nMacrophytes may also contribute.  \u201cAutochthonous-like\u201d DOM may be produced from \nDOMALL, due to in-lake chemical alterations, for example, acidification (Donahue et al. 1998) \nand photobleaching (Waiser and Robarts, 2000).  Typically, DOMAUT absorbs less UV light, \nis poorer in aromatic residues, and is more enriched in nitrogen than DOMALL (Tipping et al., \n1988; Curtis and Adams, 1995; Curtis 1998).  There are also differences in fluorescence \nproperties, for example Donahue et al. (1998) reported that, with excitation at 370 nm, the \npeak emission of DOMALL was at 462 nm, whereas that of DOMAUT was at 443 nm.  The \nrelative contributions of DOMALL and DOMAUT in a lake depend upon hydrological factors \nand the biological and physico-chemical characteristics of the water body and its surrounding \ncatchment (Thomas, 1997).  \nThacker et al. (2005) observed significant differences between functional properties of \nDOM from a eutrophic lake (Esthwaite Water, EW) and those of DOM from three stream \nwaters, one of which was an inflow to EW.  Differences between the two EW samples were \nattributed to seasonal differences in the content of DOMAUT (see also Tipping et al., 1988).  In \nthe present work we investigated the functional properties of DOM in the surface water of \nEW in more detail, and attempted to explain seasonal variability with a two end-member \n(DOMALL and DOMAUT) mixing model.  We applied the 12 assays of Table 1 to a series of \nsamples representative of the mixed surface water of the lake, and collected at different times \nof year.   \n 4 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 5 \n2.

(1986) provide a comprehensive description of the physics, chemistry \nand biology of Esthwaite Water (54o 21\u00b4N, 2o 59\u00b4W).  The catchment of the lake has an area \nof 17.1 km2 and receives 1800 mm of rainfall per year on average, of which 60% falls in \nwinter (October-March).  The annual mean temperature is c. 10 oC, with monthly averages \nthat range from c. 5 oC in January to 15 oC in July.  The lake is rarely covered with ice.  The \nlake has a surface area of 1.00 km2, mean and maximum depths of 6.4 m and 15.5 m \nrespectively, and a mean residence time of 13 weeks.  Esthwaite Water stratifies thermally in \nsummer, and then has an anoxic hypoliminion.  There is an annual plankton cycle, estimated \nby the concentration of the photosynthesis pigment chlorophyll a, denoted as [Chl a].  During \nthe period of study phytoplankton was  dominated by diatoms (Asterionella formosa) in \nspring, and by blue-green algae such as Aphanizomenon sp. and Woronichinia sp. in late \nsummer (M. DeVille, pers. comm.). Typical Chl a levels range from approximately 1 \u03bcg l-1 in \nwinter to 60 \u03bcg l-1 in late summer.  Relevant chemical characteristics of the samples taken in \nthe present work are given in Table 2.  These data are representative of the lake at all times, \nexcept during short periods in summer when high algal productivity causes higher pH \n(Maberly, 1996). \nSamples (50 l) were collected by wading into the small stream that is the lake outflow. \nThe streamwater is representative of either the whole mixed lake (winter) or the epilimnion of \nthe stratified lake (summer).  A polyethylene beaker and funnel were used to transfer water to \nthoroughly-rinsed 10-litre polyethylene bottles.  Collection took approximately 10 minutes, \nand was performed between 9.00 and 12.00 hours.  Samples were returned to the laboratory \nwithin one hour, and stored cold and dark during processing. \nThe method used to isolate the DOM is described in detail by Thacker et al. (2005) \nand involved concentrating the filtered (GF\/F Millipore, nominal pore size 0.7 \u03bcm) sample to \napproximately 500 cm3, using a high capacity, low pressure, low temperature (20 \u00baC), rotary-\nevaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-220). The sample was then passed through a column of \nAmberlite IR-120 (in the sodium form) to exchange major cations, and filtered through \nWhatman GF\/F and Millipore 0.22\u00b5m filters.  In two cases (EW4 and EW10), a second \nisolation was carried out, in which the final volume was 1000 cm3 instead of 500 cm3. \nThe raw water samples and concentrates were analysed within one week for pH \n(Radiometer GK2401C combination glass electrode), DOC (TOC-VCPN\/CPN analyzer, \nShimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), absorbance at 340 nm (Hitachi U-2000 Spectrophotometer), and \n 5 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 6 \nconductivity (Jenway 4510 meter).  Stored samples were analysed later for major cations \n(ICP-OES, Perkin Elmer Optima 4300 DV). Raw water samples were also analysed for \nalkalinity (Gran titration), major anions (Dionex DX100) and Chl a by extraction with boiling \nmethanol (Talling, 1974).  \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \nThe eleven standardised assays, previously tested and described in detail by Thacker et \nal. (2005), together with one additional optical absorbance assay (Table 1), were applied to \nthe concentrates.  For each assay, the DOM was present at a fixed concentration (10 to 100 \nmg DOC l-1 depending upon the measurement), in a solution of defined chemical \ncomposition, so that differences in the measured quantity reflected differences in the DOM, \nand not, for example, in the composition of the raw water sample.  A quality control standard, \nreference Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) purchased from the International Humic \nSubstances Society, was analysed simultaneously with the samples to characterise assay \nreproducibility.   \nThe extra assay of optical absorbance (at 254 nm) was added to increase the \ncomparability of our results with other published data (e.g. Chin et al., 1994).  However, the \nsame numbering system has been maintained for the assays as in the previous work, with the \noptical absorbance assay at 254 nm numbered as assay 12 (Table 1). \nTwo modifications were made to the assays described in Thacker et al. (2005). First, \nan extra quality control standard was formulated for the hydrophilic assay. This was done \nbecause the SRFA quality standard is isolated on the basis of its hydrophobic character, i.e. by \nadsorption onto DAX-8 resin in acid solution, and therefore has a low content of hydrophilic \nmaterial.  To obtain similar results for both standard and samples, to aid statistical analysis, a \nnew quality control standard was prepared by mixing 15 mg DOC l-1 of SRFA with 5 mg \nDOC l-1 of sodium acetate, to provide a hydrophilic component. Second, the assay output for \nbuffer capacity assay was altered to the number of acid groups titrated between pH 4 and 8, \ndue to the possibility of silicate interference. In Thacker et al. (2005), the number of acid \ngroups was titrated between pH 4 and 9. The results in Thacker et al. (2005) were reanalysed \nand it was found that variability among the DOM samples is still significantly (p<0.01) \ngreater than can be explained by analytical error, i.e. there is no change to the overall \nconclusion from the previous work.  \nIt was also found by Thacker et al. (2005) that benzo(a)pyrene binding results for the \nDOM samples did not vary significantly. To check if this phenomenon could be an artefact of \nthe method, additional measurements were made on a commercially-available humic acid \n(Aldrich Chemical Company), which has a greater affinity for hydrophobic xenobiotics than \n 6 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 7 \ndoes natural DOM (Kukkonen, 1991). Aldrich humic acid gave a log Kp for benzo(a)pyrene \nbinding of 5.11, 0.57 log units higher than the SRFA quality control and 0.49 log units higher \nthan the DOM samples, proving that the lack of variation shown by natural water samples was \nnot an artefact of the method. \n182 \n183 \n184 \n185 \n 7 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 8 \n3.

Esthwaite Water \nRaw water samples collected from EW during 2003, 2004 and 2005, all have similar \nchemistries (Table 2). From fortnightly monitoring, Tipping et al. (1988) reported [DOC] in \nEW to remain relatively constant throughout winter (November to March) with an average of \n2.0 mg l-1 while during summer (May to September) it was higher, with an average of 3.7 mg \nl-1, and the more limited number of observations of the present work are consistent with this \npattern.  The increase in [DOC] during summer was attributed to within-lake production of \nDOC as a result of plankton growth and excretion and\/or decomposition. \nPhytoplankton biomass (\u00b5g Chl a l-1) in EW is highly variable seasonally. \nDeterminations of Chl a were made fortnightly during 2003, 2004 and 2005 (M. DeVille, \npers. comm.) and the data show spring and summer maxima.  Values of [Chl a] determined on \nsamples collected for DOM assays are also shown in Table 2.  \n \n3.2. Isolation and concentration of DOM 201 \nThe isolation method gave an average DOC yield of 77% (ranging from 70% to 89%). \nThacker et al., (2005) concluded that the low recovery is caused by precipitation of calcium \ncarbonate forming during the last stages of concentration and removing some DOM by \nadsorption or co-precipitation.  A strong correlation (r = -0.92) was found between E340 values \nof raw water samples and % recovery.  Furthermore, samples with the highest raw water E340 \nvalues underwent appreciable decreases in E340 on concentration (Fig. 1).   These results show \nthat DOM lost during the isolation method is from the most strongly light-absorbing fraction.  \nTherefore, the magnitude of the loss of DOM depends on (i) the proportion of the strongly \nlight-absorbing fraction in the raw water sample, comprising the larger molecules with a \nhigher aromatic and hydrophobic character, and (ii) sufficiently high concentrations of Ca2+ \nand CO32- for precipitation to occur during the concentration process. \nTo investigate the effect of DOM losses on measured functional properties, in two \ncases (EW4 and EW10), a second sample was processed, concentrated to 1000 cm3 instead of \nthe usual 500 cm3.  By reducing the concentration factor, improved yields were obtained, \nfrom 72% to 87% for EW4 and from 78% to 84% for EW10.  The less-concentrated samples \nare referred to as EW4A and EW10A.  Assay results for the four concentrates are shown in \nTable 3.   \n \n 8 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 9 \n3.3. Variability in DOM functional properties 220 \nFigure 2 shows that for most of the assays good reproducibility was obtained for the \nquality control standard, SRFA, with relative standard deviations (RSD) of less than 5%.  The \nfluorescence assay gave an RSD of 6.5%, while an RSD of 14.8% was obtained for the assay \nof hydrophilicity monitored by optical absorption.  Results from the quality control standard \nwere used to apply the one-tailed F-test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1967), to assess variability in \nfunctional properties of the DOM samples (Thacker et al., 2005).  For 9 assays variation \namong EW DOM samples was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than can be explained by \nanalytical error i.e. by comparison with results for the SRFA standard, but no statistically \nsignificant variations were found for the assays of benzo(a)pyrene binding, copper binding \nand hydrophilicity monitored by optical absorption.   \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \nSeveral functional properties (all three extinction coefficients, fluorescence, buffer \ncapacity and hydrophilicity monitored by DOC)  show systematic seasonal variations, with a \nmaximum or minimum during the summer months.  We therefore attempted analysis of the \nresults with a two-member mixing model, hypothesising that seasonal variability can be \naccounted for in terms of mixtures of DOMAUT and DOMALL, the functional properties of \nDOMAUT and DOMALL being assumed constant.  Therefore, a given functional property, F, of \nDOM in EW will depend on the proportions of DOMAUT and DOMALL, and can be expressed \nas \nF = FAUT XAUT  + FALL XALL      (1) \nwhere FAUT and FALL are values of the functional properties of the autochthonous and \nallochthonous end-members respectively, and XAUT and XALL are the fractions of those end \nmembers. Since the sum of XAUT and XALL must be unity, equation (1) can be written \nF = FAUT XAUT  + FALL (1 - XAUT)     (2) \nSince there are 12 assays, each applied to 10 samples, there are 120 versions of \nequation (2). Therefore the total number of parameters to be found is 34, comprising 12 \nvalues each of FAUT and FALL, and 10 values of XAUT.  Rather than using the entire data set to \nextract parameter values, we initially confined the analysis to results for E254, E280 and E340.  \nExtinction coefficients were chosen firstly because additivity would clearly be expected on \nmixing the two end-members, and secondly because the measurements are highly precise \n(quality control RSD <0.5%). The \u2018Solver\u2019 facility of Microsoft \u2018Excel\u2019 was used to find \nparameters by least-squares minimisation of the sum of squared residuals between observed \nand predicted functional assay results.   \n 9 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 10 \nThe mixing model worked well, explaining 99.7% of the variance in the extinction \ncoefficients.  Moreover the derived values of XAUT, from 0.17 to 0.88, indicate that the \nsampling programme produced an adequate range of mixtures of DOMALL and DOMAUT.  The \ntop three panels of Fig. 3 show observed values of E254, E280 and E340 plotted against derived \nvalues of XAUT.  The other panels of Fig. 3 show results for the remaining assays plotted \nagainst XAUT, together with the results of regression analysis. In three cases, FDOC\/325\/450, \nHyphilDOC%, and Ac4-8, the functional property shows a significant (p < 0.01) dependence on \nXAUT.

However, the final concentrates obtained from the EW samples \nwith higher E340 values were depleted in the highly coloured aromatic fraction of DOM \n(Section 3.1, Fig. 1).  Because DOMALL has higher aromaticity, hydrophobic character and \nUV absorbance than DOMAUT (see Table 3), isolation losses may have selectively affected the \nDOMALL end-member in the final concentrate.  The results in Table 4 for samples EW4 \n(lower yield) and EW4A (higher yield) confirm this to some extent, in that EW4A gave \nsomewhat higher values of E254, E280, E340, Ac4-8, AdsDOC% and log KP, and lower values of \nFDOC\/325\/450, HyphilDOC% and HyphilA340%.  However, the differences are small, and they are \nnot reproduced by samples EW10 and EW10A.  Therefore, isolation losses of DOM do not \nseem to have had a major selective effect on functional properties. \n \n4.2 Variability in DOM  functional properties \n The successful application of the mixing model (Fig. 3, Table 4) permits the \ndistinction of three categories of DOM functional property (Table 5).  Category A comprises \nfunctional properties that vary significantly both among DOM samples and also with XAUT.  \nFor the six functional properties in this category, some (in five cases, most) of the observed \nvariability can be attributed to variations in XAUT, and co-variations in XALL.  As the fraction \nof DOMAUT in EW increases, the DOM becomes less light-absorbing and less fluorescent.  \nThese results are consistent with the findings of Donahue et al. (1998) and Waiser and \nRobarts (2004).  In addition, the present data show that DOMAUT is more hydrophilic, and \npossesses fewer acid-dissociating groups than DOMALL.  Five of the six functional properties \nin this category were also found to vary among the samples studied in previous work (Thacker \net al., 2005); the E254 was not measured previously. \n Category B comprises three functional properties that vary significantly among DOM \nsamples, but do not vary with XAUT.  Two of the three, AdsDOC% and Ads340nm%, also varied \namongst the samples studied by Thacker et al. (2005).  The consistent variability of these two \nrelated properties is evidently due to factors other than those that control variability within \ncategory A.  The photochemical fading results for EW differ from those of the other assays, \nby displaying a step-change between June and July, thereby giving rise to a bimodal pattern \n 11 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 12 \nwhen plotted against XAUT, and significant variability.  We have no explanation for this \nphenomenon at present.  In the work of Thacker et al. (2005), significant variability in A340 \nloss% was not found. \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \nCategory C comprises three functional properties that do not vary significantly among \nthe DOM samples, neither do they vary with XAUT. Thacker et al. (2005) also found that \nneither copper nor benzo(a)pyrene binding varied amongst surface water samples, but they \ndid find significant variability in hydrophilicity as measured by optical absorbance. \n \n4.3. Sources of lakewater DOM \nThe mixing model permits estimation of the functional properties of the two postulated \nDOM end-members in Esthwaite Water, even though neither can be isolated and characterised \nin a \u201cpure\u201d state.  Table 4 compares the derived properties of DOMALL with those determined \nby Thacker et al. (2005) for DOM samples from Esthwaite Hall Beck, a stream flowing into \nEW.  The results are very similar for five of the six functional assays, E254, E280, E340, \nFDOC\/325\/450 and HyphilDOC.  Agreement is less good for Ac4-8 but the result for DOMALL is \nmuch closer to the value for Esthwaite Hall Beck than is the value for DOMAUT.  Therefore, it \ncan be concluded that DOMALL has functional properties consistent with those of DOM \nentering the lake from its catchment, which is a basic assumption of the mixing model. \nA number of studies (S\u00f8ndergaard et al., 2000; J\u00f8rgensen, 1986; Norrman et al., \n1995), have implicated phytoplankton in the release of DOMAUT.  We therefore regressed  \nXAUT against  [Chl a], as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, and found a significant \nrelationship (R2 = 0.71, p<0.01).  Fig. 4 illustrates how the values of  XAUT  follow the \nseasonal pattern of [Chl a] in EW. In winter, XAUT tends to be low, whereas it is high in \nsummer. The sample collected in July 2004 during the period of highest algal biomass, \ncorresponds to the highest value of XAUT (0.88) predicted by the model.  The idea that \nphytoplankton are the main source of DOMAUT is supported by the results in Table 4 which \nshow that values of E254 and E280 derived for DOMAUT are similar to those reported for DOM \nfrom Lake Fryxell (Chin et al., 1994; Weishaar et al., 2003).  Lake Fryxell is a permanently \nice-covered lake in Antarctica, in which DOM is derived mainly from benthic and planktonic \nmicrobial populations, with  essentially no input of organic material from its surrounding \nwatershed (Aiken et al., 1996).  \nAnother possible source of DOMAUT is the in situ degradation and transformation of \nDOMALL by photolysis and bacterial assimilation.  Curtis and Schindler (1997) reported \nsignificant losses of both DOC and colour in Canadian lakes, with half-times of 166 and 122 \n 12 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 13 \nd respectively; during this processing, the characteristics of the DOC would probably move \ntowards those of DOMALL.  The average residence time of water in EW is 90 days (Heaney et \nal,. 1986), and values for the summer months tend to be longer.  Therefore degradation of \nDOMALL might well occur and contribute to DOMAUT.  However, the fact that concentrations \nof DOC increase during the summer (see Section 3.1) strongly suggests an internal source, \nand so conversion of DOMALL cannot be considered the major source of DOMAUT.   \n332 \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n358 \n359 \n360 \n \n4.4  Implications of the results \n This study and the previous work by Thacker et al. (2005) demonstrate statistically \nsignificant variability in a number of the functional properties of DOM from surface \nfreshwaters.  The results should contribute generally to the understanding of the sources and \nimpacts of DOM in freshwaters, and more specifically to the quantitative description of \nfreshwater systems, through predictive modelling, for example in estimating the chemical \nspeciation of metals (Tipping, 2002), and their toxicity (Di Toro et al., 2000).  The extensive \ndata from laboratory experiments with isolated natural organic matter (mostly fulvic and \nhumic acids) constitute a valuable resource for modelling, but average DOM properties from \nsuch studies may not be sufficient.  Although it appears from Table 5 that results for SRFA \nwould be satisfactory to predict the interactions of EW DOM with copper and \nbenzo(a)pyrene, and its adsorption to mineral surfaces, they would overestimate the \nabsorption of light, especially in surface waters dominated by DOMAUT, and also buffering \ncapacity, fluorescence, and hydrophobicity (see also Section 2).  Thus, in principle, more \nprecise predictions would result if DOM variability, between and within waters, were taken \ninto account.  However, ecosystem modelling inevitably involves  approximation, either \nbecause of lack of input data, or incomplete process characterisation, and uncertainty arising \nfrom variability in DOM properties may be overshadowed by greater uncertainties in other \nfactors.  To understand more fully the implications of the variability demonstrated by our \nresults, they need to be incorporated into different ecosystem models, and sensitivity analyses \nconducted. \n \n 13 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 14 \n5.  Conclusions 361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n \n1. The isolation method gave yields of  70 - 89%, with an average of 77%. The final \nconcentrate had less absorbance per g of DOC than the raw water sample, due to  \npreferential loss of highly coloured material during isolation.  \n2. For nine of the twelve assays, variability among DOM samples is significantly \n(p<0.01) greater than can be explained by analytical error, i.e. by comparison with \nresults from the SRFA quality control standard. The three exceptions are copper \nbinding, benzo(a)pyrene binding and hydrophilicity monitored by optical absorbance. \n3. Six of the twelve functional properties of DOM in EW could be modelled in terms of \nmixtures of DOM from the catchment (allochthonous) and DOM produced within the \nlake (autochthonous).  \n4. Of the two DOM types, autochthonous DOM is less light-absorbing, less fluorescent, \nmore hydrophilic, and possesses fewer proton-dissociating groups. \n5. The derived properties of allochthonous DOM are similar to those of DOM in \ncatchment streamwater. Autochthonous DOM is mainly derived from phytoplankton.   \n \n 14 \n25\/03\/2008 Gondar et al. \/ Functional variability of lake DOM REVISION 15 \nAcknowledgements 378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n383 \n384 \n \nWe are grateful to M.
