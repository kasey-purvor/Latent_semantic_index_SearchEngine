Small patches are also more exposed and thus more vulnerable to \nadverse weather and potential effects of climate change. These conditions may be \nless problematic for generalist species than for specialists. Using insectivorous \nwoodland birds (great tits and blue tits) as an example, we demonstrate that even \ngeneralists suffer reduced breeding success (in particular, rearing fewer and \npoorer quality young) and increased parental costs (daily energy expenditure) \nwhen living in such highly modified secondary habitats (small woods, parks, \nfarmland). Within-habitat heterogeneity (using the example of Monks Wood \nNNR) is generally associated with greater species diversity, but to benefit from \nheterogeneity at a landscape-scale may require both high mobility and the ability \nto thrive in small habitat patches. Modern landscapes, dominated by small, \nmodified and scattered habitat patches, may fail to provide specialists, especially \nsedentary ones, with access to sufficient quantity and quality of resources whilst \nsimultaneously increasing the potential for competition from generalists. \n \n \nKEYWORDS: Airborne remote sensing, habitat fragmentation, marsh tit, parkland, \nphenology \n \n \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \nThe UK is a relatively small set of islands with a long history of habitat modification \n(Darby, 1951; Johnston & Doornkamp, 1982). The current human population is \napproximately 60.5 million (Office for National Statistics) and is predicted to reach \n70 million by 2031 (Carvel, 2007). Thus modification of the landscape is only likely \nto increase as exemplified by a recently declared need to build 5 million new houses \nby 2027.  \nIn terms of overall landscape structure, human habitat modification has had two \nlarge-scale contrasting effects. Initially, the natural land cover (mostly forest) was \nreplaced and fragmented, increasing landscape heterogeneity (Rackham, 1986). More \nrecently, agricultural intensification has decreased the heterogeneity of farmland by \nremoving much of the remaining fragments of semi-natural habitat, increasing field \nsizes and promoting large-scale monoculture (Donald et al., 2001; Robinson & \nSutherland, 2002). About 65% of mainland UK and 75% of England is occupied by \nagricultural land and 50% of agricultural land in England is classed as \narable\/horticultural (Haines-Young et al., 2000). Thus changes in agricultural land use \nand farming practices are major factors driving alterations in landscape structure in \nthe UK (Benton et al., 2003). Agricultural impacts on biodiversity have been well \ndocumented, especially in the case of the decline of farmland birds (Aebischer et al., \n2000; Vickery et al 2004). Measures to increase farmland biodiversity and ecological \nproductivity include habitat creation as well as changes in management practices and \nhence also contribute to restoring structural heterogeneity. However, crop production \nremains the primary purpose of farmland and therefore, although the uptake of agri-\nenvironment schemes may eventually occur on a national scale, individual habitat \npatches and margins are relatively small and the resulting structure is fine-grained.  \n 3\nWhere land is at a premium in heavily populated modern landscapes, habitat patch \nsizes are likely to be small and connectivity high. This creates mosaics with a high \nproportion of edge-habitat and a lack of large areas of single habitat types. Such edge-\ndominated, small-patch landscapes tend to favour generalist species at the expense of \nspecialists (Lovejoy et al., 1984; Askins et al., 1987; Simberloff & Cox 1987, \nSaunders et al., 1991; With & Crist 1995). Habitat fragmentation may also be more \nsevere than is apparent from the presence of physical gaps alone. Many semi-natural \nhabitats, especially parks and gardens, are dominated by exotic plant species which \nmay support few invertebrates and hence create functional foraging gaps for higher \ntaxa such as birds (Reichard et al., 2001). Exotic plant species may also present birds \nand other animals with phenological gaps \u2013 even if they support significant \ninvertebrate populations, their timing of flowering or leafing may be inappropriate for \nnative species. In addition, climate change (both long term and acute events) may \ninteract with the above factors increasing habitat instability to which specialists may \nbe more vulnerable than generalists. Recent work on the effects of climate change and \nincreasing spring temperatures in Europe has also identified the possibility of a \ntemperature-induced mismatch between timing of breeding in birds and the timing of \nthe peak availability of their food supply (Visser et al., 1998; Visser et al., 2004). \nIn this paper, we investigate the consequences of habitat fragmentation for two \ngeneralist species of arboreal insectivorous birds which feed their young principally \non tree-dwelling caterpillars. Great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus \nwere originally forest birds, but now also breed in a range of secondary habitats \nincluding farmland, parks and gardens. In the UK with its long history of \ndeforestation, virtually all deciduous woodland could be regarded as secondary. Thus, \nwe use the terms primary and secondary habitat within a UK context, where large \n 4\nwoods constitute the least modified and best available \u201cprimary\u201d woodland habitat \nand small woods, parks and farmland comprise more highly fragmented and modified \n\u201csecondary\u201d habitats. We demonstrate that even these apparently adaptable tits have \nreduced breeding success and higher parental costs in secondary habitats due to \nfragmentation and gap effects. We also examine how climate interacts with bird \necology and habitat suitability. The implications of these results for the persistence of \nhabitat specialists compared to generalists in highly modified landscapes are \ndiscussed with reference to a third parid, the marsh tit Poecile palustris which is still \nlargely confined to mature deciduous woodland. Although the terms \u201cgeneralist\u201d and \n\u201cspecialist\u201d imply a dichotomy, in reality species will comprise a continuum \ndepending on their responses to the availability and quality of particular key \nresources. The effects of fine-grained landscape-scale habitat variation are also \nconsidered in relation to heterogeneity within a single habitat type using woodland \n(Monks Wood National Nature Reserve, NNR) as an example.  \n \nMethods \nHabitat heterogeneity \nMonks Wood NNR (52o24\u2019 N, 0 o14\u2019 W) comprises 157 ha of mixed deciduous \nwoodland in Cambridgeshire in eastern England (Gardiner & Sparks, 2005) (Figure \n1). The boundaries of the NNR are as shown in Figure 1b and 1d. The additional \nblock of woodland across the road to the south (Figure 1a and 1c) is a privately owned \nconifer plantation (Bevill\u2019s Wood). A tree species map of Monks Wood was derived \nfrom supervised classification of Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) multi-spectral \ndata from 2003 (George, 2005). Different types of vegetation cover including \ndifferent tree species have characteristic reflectance spectra due to differential \n 5\nreflection of solar radiation (Carleer & Wolff, 2004). Tree species also differ in leaf \nphenology, e.g. timing and rate of senescence, increasing the differences in \nreflectance spectra. Thus, using ATM data from five images of the wood, the six most \nabundant tree species (55% common ash Fraxinus excelsior, 21% English oak \nQuercus robur, 14% field maple Acer campestre, 7% aspen Populus tremulus, 2% \nsilver birch Betula pendula and 1% elm Ulmus spp.) in the top canopy (minimum \nheight threshold of 8 m) were mapped with an accuracy of 89%.  \nTop canopy height and sub-canopy understory height were mapped using airborne \nLight Detection And Ranging (LiDAR). Airborne LiDAR can describe vegetation \nstructure at both high resolution (sub-metre) and at a landscape-scale (Lefsky et al., \n2002; Lim et al., 2003; Vierling et al., 2008) and thus has particular value in \necological applications (Hill et al., 2004; Bradbury et al., 2005; Hinsley et al., 2006, \n2008). LiDAR uses a laser range finder to measure the height of points beneath the \nflight-path of an aircraft. Short duration pulses of near infrared laser light are fired at \nthe ground and the return signals reflected from the ground and surface features such \nas trees and buildings are recorded (Wehr & Lohr, 1999). The timing of the returns, \ncombined with measurement of the aircraft\u2019s orientation and position, allow the 3D \nposition of the points to be calculated and geo-referenced. Digital models of the \nsurface of the ground and of vegetation canopy height can then be derived from these \nmeasurements (Hill et al., 2002; Gaveau & Hill, 2003; Hill & Thomson, 2005). The \nLiDAR data for the Monks Wood top canopy model were acquired on June 10th 2000 \nusing an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) 1210 scanner with a 10 kHz \nlaser pulse repetition rate, scan angle of \u00b1 10o and a post spacing of one hit per 4.83 \nm2. For the understory model, data were acquired on 14th April 2003 and 26th June \n2005 using an Optech Inc. ALTM-3033 with a 33 kHz laser pulse repetition rate. The \n 6\nApril (leaf-off) data were acquired at an average flying altitude of 980 m, with a scan \nhalf angle of 15o generating 1 laser hit per 1 m2, whilst the June (leaf-on) data were \nacquired at an average flying altitude of 1,125 m, with a scan half angle of 20o \ngenerating 1 laser hit per 2 m2 (Hill, 2007).  \n  \nFragmentation and reproductive success \nReproductive performance of great tits and blue tits was monitored for pairs breeding \nin nest boxes in large woods, small woods, urban parkland and farmland. The large \nwoods comprised Monks Wood (36 boxes) and Brampton Wood (52o19\u2019 N, 0 o16\u2019 W, \n132 ha, 22 boxes) in Cambridgeshire. Both are mixed deciduous woodlands in which \nthe dominant tree species are common ash, English oak and field maple, with \nBrampton Wood also having some areas of spruce Picea spp. and pine Pinus spp. The \nunderstory in both is predominantly hawthorn Crataegus spp., blackthorn Prunus \nspinosus and hazel Coryllus avellana (Collins et al., 2005). Up to 53 boxes were \nlocated in up to 36 small woods (0.1-1.39 ha) in Cambridgeshire and south \nLincolnshire. All are mixed deciduous woods with the same dominant tree and \nunderstory species as the two large woods, but with additional small numbers of a \nwide range of species. All these woods are part of a long-term study of woodland bird \necology in eastern England (e.g. Hinsley et al., 1999, 2006). The landscape in this \narea is dominated by intensive arable agriculture. \nBreeding performance in parkland was monitored in up to 26 boxes in Bute Park \n(51o29\u2019 N, 3 o11\u2019 W, c. 53 ha) in the centre of Cardiff, south Wales and in up to 42 \nboxes in the Cambridge Botanic Gardens (52o12\u2019 N, 0 o08\u2019 E, c. 25 ha). Bute Park \ncomprises a mixture of mown grassland, sports pitches, an arboretum, plant nurseries \nand areas of more natural woodland dominated by sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, \n 7\nNorway maple Acer platanoides and common lime Tilia europaea. The Cambridge \nBotanic Gardens, in the centre of the city, is a formally managed arboretum with \ngarden displays, mown grass, water features, greenhouses and visitor facilities, plus \nsome small areas of less heavily managed vegetation. At both sites, tree species \ndiversity is high with many exotics (broadleaves and conifers) often planted in broad \ntaxonomic groups within which many species and varieties are represented. The park \nand gardens are both heavily used by the public. \nFarmland breeding tits were monitored in 75 tit boxes and 15 sparrow boxes (each \nwith three compartments) making a total of 120 \u201cboxes\u201d. The boxes were located in \nhedgerow trees, hedges and the occasional small clump of trees across about 9 km2 of \nintensive arable farmland in Buckinghamshire, east central England (51o57\u2019 N, 1 o00\u2019 \nW). The trees were mostly English oak and common ash and the hedges mixed \nhawthorn, blackthorn, hazel and elm plus small amounts of other species.  \nAt all sites, boxes were visited approximately weekly from the end of March until \nJuly. Parameters defining breeding success were recorded as follows: (i) first egg \ndate, (ii) clutch size, (iii) mean chick weight (g) at 11 days of age, (excluding runts) \nand (iv) the number of young fledged. Chicks were weighed to 0.1 g using a spring \nbalance. Mean chick body mass provided an estimate of territory quality because it \nintegrates the availability and abundance of food in the territory with the adults\u2019 \nabilities to collect it and deliver it to the young (Hinsley et al., 2002, 2006). Previous \nwork has also shown that heavier young are those most likely to survive to breed (e.g. \nPerrins & McCleery, 2001). \nResults were examined for three years (2005 to 2007) for all sites except farmland \nfor which data were available only for 2007. In total, data were available for two large \nwoods, about 30 small woods, two urban parks but only one farmland site. Thus to \n 8\nfacilitate analysis between habitat types, the farmland data were divided by an \narbitrary east\/west division of the site into two approximately equal parts. To test for \ndifferences in performance in the different habitat types, a mixed model with fixed \neffects for habitat type, year and type x year interaction, and random effects for site, \nsite x year interaction and nest box was used. The model allowed for correlation \nbetween observations on nest boxes from the same site, in a particular year and\/or in \ndifferent years, and thereby avoided the pseudo-replication problem of treating \nobservations on all boxes as statistically independent. The model was fitted by the \nmethod of residual maximum likelihood (REML) using the statistical package Genstat \n7 (Patterson & Thompson, 1971).    \n \nStructural and functional gaps \nThe influences of structural and functional gaps on breeding success were examined \nby monitoring birds breeding in the four different habitats as described above. The \neffects of such gaps on the adults themselves were investigated in two habitat types \n(large wood and park) by measuring the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of adults \nfeeding large (10-11 days of age) nestlings (Hinsley et al., 2008). Adults foraging in \npatchy habitat waste time and energy simply crossing gaps to reach suitable foraging \nlocations (Hinsley, 2000). Increased adult energy expenditure may be detrimental for \nlong-term adult survival (Daan et al., 1996) and in the shorter term may reduce food \ndelivery to the nest if adults spend more time foraging for themselves.  \nIn Bute Park, structural gaps in the tree canopy were common. The percentage of \ngap in the canopy within a 30 m radius of each nest box was calculated from a LiDAR \ntop canopy model (data acquired in June 2004, Hinsley et al., 2008) derived as \ndescribed above for Monks Wood (Figure 1c). In Monks Wood, structural gaps were \n 9\nrare, but functional gaps were created by the patchy availability of oak trees (Figure \n1b) which comprise a prime source of the caterpillars essential for rearing young \n(Fischbacher et al., 1998). Thus, the percentage of oak in the canopy within 30 m of \neach box was calculated from the Monks Wood tree canopy map (Figure 1b). English \noak was uncommon in the park and largely absent within 30 m of any box.   \nThe DEE of free-living great tits and blue tits feeding young was measured in Bute \nPark and Monks Wood using doubly labelled water (Speakman, 1997). This technique \nuses the differential turnover of oxygen-18 (excreted from the body in water and \ncarbon dioxide) and deuterium (excreted in water) to measure carbon dioxide \nproduction which can then be converted to energy expenditure. The two isotopes are \nstable, but being heavier than the commonly occurring forms of oxygen and hydrogen \ncan be measured in blood (or urine) samples using a mass spectrometer. The \ntechnique has been used on a wide range of animals, including humans, and provides \nthe best means of measuring energy expenditure in free-living animals performing \ntheir normal activities.  \nEnergy expenditure was measured in both great tits and blue tits in Bute Park and \nin great tits only (too few boxes were occupied by blue tits) in Monks Wood in 2003 \nand 2004. Measurements were also made in 2005 in the park to compensate for the \nsmall sample size (one bird) in 2003. Full details are given in Hinsley et al., (2008). \nAll procedures were carried out under licence (see acknowledgements). The \nrelationships between DEE and the presence of structural gaps (percentage canopy \ngap) in Bute Park and of functional gaps (percentage of the tree canopy which was not \noak) in Monks Wood were described using quadratic regression. \n \n \n 10\nTiming, temporal gaps and climate effects \nIn Monks Wood and Bute Park, the timing and progression of tree leafing was scored \non a scale of 0 to 6 as follows: 0 = tightly closed dormant buds, 1 = swollen buds, no \ngreen showing between scales, 2 = swollen buds, green showing between scales, 3 = \nleaf beginning to emerge from bud, 4 = leaf half open, 5 = leaf fully open, but not \nfully expanded, 6 = leaf fully expanded. Six English oak and six common ash were \nrecorded at both sites; in addition, six sycamore and six Norway maple were recorded \nin the park because they were abundant and early. The overall state of bud burst\/leaf \nexpansion for the bottom half of each tree was scored at least once a week. Results \nwere expressed as an average per species for oak and ash, and for the two Acer spp. \ncombined.  \nTiming of breeding of great tits and blue tits in all four habitat types was assessed \nusing the date on which each female laid her first egg, recorded by monitoring nest \nboxes as described above. Timing of breeding in tits can vary quite widely between \nyears (e.g. Perrins, 1970) and thus results are shown for two years to illustrate the \npattern across the four habitats in both a relatively early (2007) and relatively late \n(2006) year (although data were only available for farmland in 2007). Results for 15 \nyears (from 1993 to 2007) for Monks Wood, Brampton Wood and the small woods \nwere used to demonstrate the influence of local climate on the timing of breeding and \nhow this relationship was influenced by habitat fragmentation. The mean first egg \ndate for great tits in each of the two large woods and for all the small woods \ncombined were calculated for each of the 15 years. In general, warm springs are more \nfavourable for breeding success in tits than cold ones (Slagsvold, 1976, Hinsley et al., \n1999). The warmth sum, calculated as the sum of the maximum daily temperature \nfrom March 1st to April 25th (McCleery & Perrins, 1998), was used as an index of \n 11\nlocal spring warmth. Maximum daily temperatures were obtained from a \nMeteorological Office weather station located about 100 m from Monks Wood and c. \n9 km from Brampton Wood. The relationships between egg dates and the warmth sum \nwere described using linear regression and the slopes and elevations of the lines for \nMonks Wood, Brampton Wood and the small woods were compared by ANCOVA.  \nThe interaction of climate with habitat structure and the consequences for breeding \nsuccess were illustrated using data for Monks Wood from two years with contrasting \nspring weather. In 1997, spring was early and warm (mean first egg date 9th April, \nwarmth sum  = 759) whereas in 2001 it was late and cold (mean first egg date 27th \nApril, warmth sum  = 568). The relationships between mean chick body mass, i.e. \nchick quality, and canopy height (obtained from the LiDAR top canopy model for \nMonks Wood, Figure 1c) around the nest box were compared in these two years using \nlinear regression (Hinsley et al., 2006). \n \nResults \nHabitat heterogeneity \nThe heterogeneity of Monks Wood in terms of both structure and tree species \ncomposition is illustrated in Figure 1. Aerial photography (Figure 1a) provided \ninformation about relatively large features such as fields and the main glades and \nrides, and some qualitative indication of canopy evenness or closure. The tree species \nmap derived from ATM reflectance data (Figure 1b) showed that species composition \nis dominated by common ash. Despite this, the six main species are well mixed across \nthe wood, but with heterogeneity tending to be greater in the centre and the east. The \ncanopy height model provided by LiDAR (Figure 1c) showed that top canopy height \nwas highly heterogeneous across the wood, with the tallest trees concentrated more \n 12\ntowards the edges and tending to reflect the distribution of ash trees (Figure 1b). The \nlower and more open character of the canopy in the centre of the wood is not apparent \nin the aerial photograph (Figure 1a). The sub-tree canopy understory model (Figure \n1d) also showed considerable variation in structure across the wood with the tallest \nshrub layer in the west and central eastern parts of the wood. \n \nFragmentation and reproductive success \nOverall, reproductive success in both great tits and blue tits declined with declining \nhabitat patch size (e.g. from large woods to small woods) and with increasing \nfragmentation (e.g. from woods to park\/farmland) (Figure 2). Both fewer (Figure 2c, \n& f) and poorer quality (i.e. lower body mass, Figure 2b & e) young were reared in \nsecondary habitats. The models showed that the declining trend from large to small to \npark\/farmland was significant for both species for all three parameters of breeding \nsuccess except numbers fledged for great tits where some effect was suggested by the \nP value of <0.10 (Table 1). For great tits there was a Type x Year interaction for chick \nmass and the number fledged indicating differences between habitat types between \nyears (Figure 2). There were no such interactions for blue tits. The declining trends \nsuggested that farmland and parkland were similarly poor, but to determine the \nrelative status of farmland will require more data.  \n \nStructural and functional gaps \nDespite their reduced breeding success, great tits in Bute Park worked harder than \nthose in Monks Wood (Park: DEE = 86.3 \u00b1 12.3 kJ day-1, n = 12; Wood: DEE = 78.0 \n\u00b1 11.7 kJ day-1, n = 23; t = 1.97, P = 0.058) and because of the smaller brood sizes, \nnearly twice as hard for each chick reared (Park: DEE per chick = 14.6 \u00b1 4.8 kJ day-1; \n 13\nWood: DEE per chick = 8.9 \u00b1 1.7 kJ day-1; t = 5.12, P < 0.001). The parental costs of \nrearing young increased as the amount of gap around the nest site increased (Figure \n3a). In Bute Park, the tits that were working harder than the average for all the birds \nmeasured in the park were those with more than about 35% gap around their boxes. In \nMonks Wood, there was no relationship between parental DEE and the presence of \nstructural gaps around the boxes because the amount of gap was small (less than 1% \nfor 21 out of 36 boxes and less than 10% for 26 boxes) and less than that in the park \n(Wood: Gap = 1 \u00b1 4%, n = 22; Park: Gap = 33 \u00b1 23%, n = 26, t26 = 7.02, P < 0.001). \nHowever, a functional gap effect was evident in that females with less than about 30% \noak around their boxes (i.e. about 70% \u201cnon-oak\u201d) were working harder than the \naverage for all birds measured in the wood (Figure 3b) (Hinsley et al., 2008). \n \nTiming, temporal gaps and climate effects \nSigns of leafing, i.e. bud swelling, in oak and ash started a little earlier in Bute Park \nthan in Monks Wood, but timing of leaf emergence and expansion were similar \n(Figure 4). However, overall timing of leafing in the park was earlier due to the much \nlarger number of tree species; leaf expansion in the maples started about 20 days \nbefore that in oak and ash in the wood (Figure 4).  \nPrevious work has shown timing of breeding in both great tits and blue tits to be \nlater in small woods compared to large woods (Hinsley et al., 1999), whereas urban \ngreat tits, but not blue tits, tend to be early (Perrins, 1979, Cowie & Hinsley, 1987). \nThese same trends were found at our sites (Table 2). Farmland birds were late \ncompared to large woods, but unlike woodland where blue tits tend to start breeding a \nlittle earlier than great tits, timing was similar in both species on farmland (Table 2). \n 14\nHowever, as shown here (and see below), timing of breeding in tits can vary \nsubstantially between years and data were only available for farmland for one year. \nLocal climate, summarised as a simple temperature index, the warmth sum, \ninfluenced timing of breeding in great tits such that egg laying started earlier in \nwarmer springs (Figure 5). Over the 15 years from 1993 to 2007, the mean first egg \ndate varied by 22 days in the two large woods, Brampton and Monks Wood, and by \n30 days across large and small woods. The interaction between site and warmth sum \nwas not significant in an ANCOVA of first egg date on these two variables, and hence \nthe regression lines did not differ in slope between sites (F2,39 = 0.08, P > 0.200). \nHowever, the lines did differ significantly in elevation (F2,41 = 17.0, P < 0.0005), the \ncommon slope (\u00b1 SE) being -0.0687 \u00b1 0.0092. The mean first egg dates (\u00b1 SD) for the \nthree sites were Brampton Wood: 18.5 \u00b1 5.8, Monks Wood: 20.0 \u00b1 6.6 and small \nwoods: 26.4 \u00b1 5.6. Therefore, the significant difference in elevation was almost \nentirely a consequence of the difference in timing of breeding between small and \nlarge woods. \nClimate also influenced great tit breeding performance in Monks Wood in relation \nto habitat selection; mean chick body mass increased with canopy height in warm \nsprings, but decreased with height in cold springs (Figure 6).  \n   \nDiscussion \nGreat tits and blue tits are common and widespread inhabitants of secondary habitats, \nbut even as generalists, the birds pay costs in terms of both reduced breeding success \nand higher parental energy expenditure in comparison to their performance in \ncontinuous woodland. Even in woodland, an effect of functional gaps, i.e. \u201cnon-oak\u201d \nforaging habitat, was detected. There was little or no English oak near the nest boxes \n 15\nin Bute Park and exotic tree species were common, as they are in many secondary \nhabitats. Therefore, both structural and functional gaps, and their concomitant ill \neffects, are likely to be widespread in secondary habitats. For example, as \nurbanisation increases, small arboreal insectivores are typically the first to disappear \n(Clergeau et al., 1998); urban avifaunas are characterised by medium-sized, ground-\nfeeding granivores (Marzluff et al., 2001). In addition to rearing fewer and poorer \nquality young, adult survival in secondary habitats may also be reduced. Increased \nenergy expenditure and late breeding have both been linked to lower adult survival \n(Thomas et al., 2001; Nilsson & Svensson, 1996), but other factors (such as artificial \nfood and warmer urban temperatures) associated with some secondary habitats may \nhave a positive influence on survival (see below).  \nEvidence from blue tits breeding in adjacent forest types in the south of France \n(Dias & Blondel, 1996) and from other studies (van Noordwijk et al., 1981, \nLambrechts & Dias, 1993) has shown that timing is partly under genetic control. \nImmigrants may mistime their breeding attempts relative to the local food supply and \nsuffer reduced success, increased parental costs and lower survival (Thomas et al., \n2001). Timing is also profoundly affected by climate at both local and geographical \nscales (Slagsvold, 1976; McCleery & Perrins, 1998). Given that timing differs \nbetween habitat types (Table 2, Figure 5) as well as forest types, the potential for \nclimate change to cause mismatching between rates of plant and insect development, \nbird reproductive condition and the cues birds use to initiate breeding is substantial \n(Visser et al., 1998; Sanz, 2003). Single-brooded species may be most at risk, but \nclimate factors can also affect multi-brooded species, especially by reducing the \nnumber of broods produced each year (Peach et al., 2004). Small and modified habitat \n 16\npatches may be particularly vulnerable to climatic effects, for example, due to \nexposure and drying of soils under drought conditions (Saunders et al., 1991). \nParadoxically, although great tits and blue tits breed less well and at greater cost in \nsecondary habitats, the national UK populations of both have increased (British Trust \nfor Ornithology, 2006). As small, hole-breeders, tits can be limited by nest site \navailability (e.g. East & Perrins, 1988) and the major cause of annual mortality is \nstarvation\/predation in cold winter weather (Newton, 1998). Many secondary habitats, \nespecially gardens, (but also primary woodland sites) are now supplied with nest \nboxes and a majority of households provide food for birds, especially in winter \n(Cowie & Hinsley, 1988; Cannon et al., 2005). The national success of these two \nspecies may therefore depend at least in part on the fortuitous provision of both nest \nsites and food by humans and a trend in the UK towards milder winters. However, the \nsuccess of great tits and blue tits in exploiting these new resources may be detrimental \nfor other, less adaptable species, and those limited by other factors. For example, \nusurpation of willow tit Poecile montanus nest holes by great tits and blue tits has \nbeen implicated in the long-term decline (c. 80% in last 40 years) of this species \n(Maxwell, 2002; Gregory et al., 2002).  \nBy definition, habitat specialists are likely to be more vulnerable to loss, \nfragmentation and modification of their primary habitat, less likely to exploit \nsecondary habitats and prone to competition\/predation from increasing numbers of \ngeneralists. Sedentary species and poor dispersers will be at particular risk. Marsh tits \nare sedentary, hole-breeding, arboreal insectivores similar in size to blue tits, but \nseldom occur in secondary habitats. They maintain year-round, relatively large (c. 4-5 \nha) territories in mature deciduous woodland and require the presence of a well-\ndeveloped shrub layer (Broughton et al., 2006; Hinsley et al., 2007). Unlike great tits \n 17\nand blue tits, they do not commonly exploit human-provided food and rarely use nest \nboxes. Also unlike great tits and blue tits, the national UK population of marsh tits has \ndeclined by more than 50% in the last 25 years (Gregory et al., 2002) and declines \nhave been greater in smaller woods set in less wooded landscapes (Amar et al., 2006). \nIn recent years, the Monks Wood marsh tit population has been stable at about 22 \npairs, whereas numbers in smaller, surrounding woods fluctuate from one (or none) to \nfive pairs (R. Broughton, unpubl. data). In 2006, immigrants from these smaller \nwoods comprised about 65% of juveniles present in the autumn in Monks Wood. In \n2007, conditions during chick rearing were poor (cold, wet and windy), and probably \ndisproportionately so in these smaller woods, and the proportion of immigrant \njuveniles fell to about 50%, raising a real possibility of inbreeding. It also highlights \nthe vulnerability of sedentary specialists to the loss of particular key sites. Without \nMonks Wood, the marsh tit populations in the surrounding small woods would \nprobably collapse. Thus habitat fragmentation in this landscape where woodland is \nsparse and highly fragmented (Bellamy et al., 1998) has at least the potential to be \nmore detrimental for the specialist marsh tit than for the more generalist great tit and \nblue tit. However, as discussed above, even these two adaptable species fare less well \nin secondary habitats, which bodes ill for less mobile, more specialist species.  \nWithin a particular habitat type, such as Monks Wood in Figure 1, heterogeneity \ncontributes to diversity. For example, the numbers of nightingales Luscinia \nmegarhynchos in Monks Wood has declined to 0-2 pairs in recent years as the wood \nhas matured and the habitat structure required by this species has become rare \n(Gardiner & Sparks, 2005). Conversely, re-growth after widening of some rides has \nincreased the availability of low bushy vegetation allowing whitethroats Sylvia \ncommunis to colonise these interior patches. In addition to the numerous biotic and \n 18\nabiotic differences between large and small habitat patches (Saunders et al., 1991), a \nkey factor in the ability of a species to exploit heterogeneity at any scale is mobility. \nA poorly dispersing woodland specialist can traverse unsuitable woodland habitat, but \nmay have less success in moving between landscape elements (Gjerde & Wegge, \n1989; Matthysen & Currie, 1996). The provision under agri-environment schemes of \nrelatively small and dispersed habitat patches across a large proportion of UK \nfarmland has a good chance of success for at least some species of farmland birds \nbecause they are relatively mobile and adept at exploiting localised and shifting food \nresources (Newton, 1972). Conversely, small, dispersed woods will not maintain \nmarsh tits. The lesser spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos minor is another woodland \nspecies in steep decline (Gregory et al., 2002). In contrast to the sedentary marsh tit, it \nis highly mobile with a home range size of several hundred hectares (Wiktander et al., \n2001), but for specialists, habitat quantity goes hand-in-hand with habitat quality \n(Olsson et al., 2001). If modern landscapes are to provide for specialists as well as \ngeneralists, they will need to contain certain minimum quantities of good quality \nhabitat. Given the conflicting and wide-ranging pressures on land use in modern \nlandscapes, this presents a considerable challenge. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe are grateful to the Esm\u00e9e Fairbairn Foundation for funding the DLW procedure, \nand to Peter Rothery for statistical advice.
