Univocalists about \nconsciousness argue that it is not.   By drawing upon the history of philosophy and \npsychology, and some simple technical resources from semantic theory, we gain an \naccount of why \u2018consciousness\u2019 means the various things that it does.  Univocalism is \nshown to be implausible.  This is important, for if we accept the univocalist account \nthen we are less likely to subject our thought and talk about the mind to the kind of \ncritical analysis that it needs.  The exploration of the semantics of \u2018consciousness\u2019 \noffered here, by way of contrast, helps to clarify and fine-tune our thought and talk \nabout consciousness and conscious mentality. \n \n \n \nYou are at a conference and a former colleague says:  \u2018I am writing a book on \nconsciousness.\u2019  From this isolated remark it is not at all clear just what she is \nwriting her book about.  Is it about self-knowledge?  Is it about the qualitative \nnature of experience?  Is it about our waking mental life? There is nothing odd \nabout this kind of ambiguity.  People have been going on about the ambiguous, \npolysemic nature of consciousness for a very long time, and they still go on about it \ntoday. (Hamilton 1859; Bain 1879; Lewis 1960; Burt 1962; Natsoulas 1978; Wilkes \n1988; Allport 1988; Nelkin 1993; Block 1995).  Two points of agreement seem to \nemerge from such reflection.  First, \u2018consciousness\u2019 means a number of different \nthings: \u2018consciousness\u2019 is polysemic.  Second, there is a risk of misunderstanding or \nconfusing these different notions: \u2018consciousness\u2019 is ambiguous.  \n Because \u2018consciousness\u2019 is polysemic and ambiguous contemporary theorists \nof mind engage in explicit discussion about the kinds of phenomena that \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 denotes (Rosenthal 1997; Tye 1996; Lormand 1996).  Given the risk \nof conflation and confusion there is also a widespread practice of explicitly \n  \n \n2\nspecifying, and differentiating, various species of consciousness.1 Theorists need this \nfine-tuned technical vocabulary because \u2018consciousness\u2019 itself has a number of \ndifferent meanings that are apt to be conflated.   \nThis proliferation of technical vocabulary poses an obstacle to clear \ncommunication within philosophy, and between philosophers and psychologists. Do \nthese different terms refer to different phenomena?  Or are some of them merely \ndifferent terms for one and the same thing?  If your colleague says that she is writing \na book on \u2018monitoring consciousness\u2019 is that the same thing as \u2018access consciousness\u2019 \nor \u2018epistemic consciousness\u2019?  One response to the proliferation of notions of \nconsciousness is to argue that there is, contrary to appearances, a unique core \nnotion\u2014this is univocalism about consciousness.    \n \n2.  Univocalism \n \n2.1. McBride: against polysemy \n \nMost contemporary theorists of consciousness accept a broad tripartite distinction \nbetween state consciousness, creature consciousness, and transitive consciousness.  \n(Rosenthal, 1997; Carruthers, 1996; Block, 1997; Lycan, 1996; Dretske, 1993; \nVanGulick 1996).  We talk of people and animals being conscious (creature \nconsciousness), we talk of their being conscious of something, and of their being \nconscious that something is the case (transitive consciousness).  We can also pose the \nquestion of \u2018what it is for a mental state to be conscious\u2019 (Rosenthal 1997, 729).  In \n                                                 \n1 For example: state consciousness; creature consciousness; phenomenal consciousness; access \nconsciousness; transitive consciousness; intransitive consciousness; monitoring consciousness; \n  \n \n3\nposing such a question we are concerned with state consciousness (Rosenthal 1993, \n197; Rosenthal 1997, 729).  \nMcBride (1999) argues that these distinctions, amongst different notions of \nconsciousness, do not correspond to any real distinction in phenomena.  McBride is \nthus primarily concerned one particular way in which \u2018consciousness\u2019 is said to be \npolysemic: i.e., that \u2018consciousness\u2019 denotes a range of distinct phenomena.  \nMcBride argues for a \u2018Unitary Thesis\u2019 whereby \u2018being in a conscious state, being \nconscious of something and being conscious to some degree are, rather than distinct \nmental phenomena, actually bound together in conscious experience\u2019  (McBride 1999, \n194).  This argument rests upon the assumption that \u2018distinct phenomena can \nmanifest distinctly, i.e., independently\u2019 (1999, p. 187).  If state consciousness, \ntransitive consciousness and creature consciousness really were distinct then it should \nbe possible for them to be manifest independently of one another.  He then draws \nupon intuitions to the effect that (i) a creature cannot be conscious without that \ncreature having some conscious mental state; (ii) a creature cannot have a conscious \nmental state without its also being the case that the creature is conscious;  (iii) a \ncreature who is conscious of something has a conscious mental state.  Such intuitions \nare meant to establish that each putative species of consciousness cannot, in fact, be \nmanifest in independence of the others.   \nThe assumption that distinct phenomena must be able to manifest themselves \ndistinctly is itself questionable.  Suppose we accept that a creature is conscious if and \nonly if it has conscious mental states.  All this amounts to is the fact that there is a \nlogical interdependence between two notions: that of a conscious creature or subject, \nand that of a conscious mental state.  However, this logical interdependence does not, \n                                                                                                                                            \npersonal consciousness; self-consciousness; epistemic consciousness; experiential consciousness; \n  \n \n4\nby itself, rule out the distinctness of state consciousness and creature consciousness as \nproperties.  To see that this is so we need simply note that conscious subjects can (and \ndo) have unconscious mental states.  Suppose we want to know what the difference \nbetween conscious and unconscious mental states consists in.  If both kinds of state \nare states of a conscious subject, it cannot be the subject\u2019s consciousness simpliciter \nwhich constitutes the difference.  Insofar as we can seek to explain the conscious (as \nopposed to unconscious) status of a mental state, as opposed to the conscious (as \nopposed to unconscious) status of a subject of mental states, we should admit that \nstate consciousness and creature consciousness denote different properties, even if \nthere is a logical relation between them.   \n  \n2.2. Antony: against ambiguity  \n \nMichael V. Antony (2001; 2002) proposes a more subtle, less unitarian, variant of \nunivocalism about consciousness.  He accepts that our everyday discourse does \nindeed deploy different notions of consciousness (e.g., class consciousness; \nconsciousness as the waking state).  But, he argues, this is not problematic for \npsychology or philosophy.  After all, no one in their right mind would argue from the \ntrue premiss that \u2018rock\u2019 can mean different things in everyday English (a type of \nmusic; large mass of stone; a type of sweet, etc), that geologists run the risk of \nconflating these notions.  Everyday language abounds with homonyms but competent \nadult speakers are well able to draw upon their background knowledge and \nunderstanding of the context of utterance to determine a correct interpretation of what \nthe speaker means.   \n                                                                                                                                            \nnonphenomenal consciousness; minimal consciousness; perceptual consciousness, to name but a few. \n  \n \n5\n Homonymy is not the same as polysemy.  Homonymous terms need have \nlittle, if anything, in common at the semantic level.  Polysemic terms, by way of \ncontrast, seem to have something in common at the semantic level.  Identifying the \nprecise distinction between homonymy and polysemy is not easy.  Antony seeks to \nshow that, at least with regard to contemporary philosophical and psychological \ntheorising about consciousness we can view the many putatively distinct notions of \nconsciousness as having a single semantic notion at their core.  Antony thus accepts \nthat \u2018consciousness\u2019 is used in a variety of different ways.  What he seeks to show is \nthat this variety of uses can be explained in terms of the \u2018highlighting\u2019 of this or that \nfeature of some widely accepted core notion of consciousness.  More specifically, the \nsuperficial variability in notions of consciousness is to be explained in terms of \nsemantic modulation (Cruse 1986).  Semantic modulation involves semantic \nvariability relative to a fixed meaning.  For example, the lexical term \u2018good\u2019 has a \ndifferent sense in \u2018good car\u2019; \u2018good child\u2019; \u2018good riddance\u2019, but there is something in \ncommon between the different uses of \u2018good\u2019, unlike the case of homonyms like \n\u2018rock\u2019 (meaning music) and \u2018rock\u2019 (meaning large mass of stone). \n Antony argues that we can understand the various senses of \u2018consciousness\u2019 \nwithin contemporary theorising about the mind as modulations of a single core sense \nof \u2018consciousness\u2019.  This univocalist strategy is both similar to, but distinct from, \nMcBride\u2019s.  McBride\u2019s \u2018Unitary Thesis\u2019 sought to place one particular notion of \nconsciousness as the core notion: \u2018the main thrust of the Unitary Thesis was plain, \nconsciousness is about conscious experience\u2019 (1999, 184).  Antony\u2019s account is \nunivocalist but less unitarian.  In Antony\u2019s view, the core, general notion of \nconsciousness is a complex, many-stranded one.   \n  \n  \n \n6\nCorresponding to the word \u2018consciousness\u2019 we have a rich conception \nof a complex and multi-faceted mental phenomenon.  This phenomenon \nappears to comprise (something like) states and events with \nphenomenal or qualitative aspects that are temporally located, that enter \ninto part-whole relations, that are related to intentional features of the \nmind, that enter into causal relations with one another and with \nunconscious mental states and events, and so on.  This complex \nphenomenon seems intimately linked to wakefulness, attentiveness, and \ncapacities for \u201cinner reflection\u201d\u2014though perhaps none of those are \nnecessary.  Something like that, and much more, goes to make up our \ncomplex conception or picture of consciousness.  (2001, 28-29) \n \nGiven that theorists\u2019 interests and explanatory concerns vary, and given the \ncomplexity of the core notion of consciousness, it is not surprising that \u2018different \nfeatures of the phenomenon on different occasions will be thrown into relief or \nemphasized\u2014sometimes phenomenal features, sometimes functional or cognitive \nones, etc.\u2014while others are suppressed\u2019 (2001, 29).  So, the basic idea is that (a) there \nis some notion of consciousness that contemporary theorists are already all committed \nto; (b) we can explain away polysemy via semantic modulation of this core notion; (c) \ngiven (a) metalinguistic reflection about \u2018consciousness\u2019 and its senses is redundant \nand apt to mislead (Antony 2001; 2002).  \n But what about the creature consciousness\/state consciousness distinction?  \nWe saw above that this seems to be a genuine distinction between different properties \ndenoted by \u2018consciousness\u2019.  Doesn\u2019t this suggest that \u2018consciousness\u2019 is ambiguous, \nat the very least, between state and creature consciousness?  Antony, like McBride, \n  \n \n7\nobjects to the widespread acceptance of the state consciousness\/creature \nconsciousness distinction.  First, he suggests that if creature consciousness is \ninterpreted as something akin to \u2018wakefulness\u2019 then it doesn\u2019t really correspond \u2018to a \nmeaning of \u2018consciousness\u2019 within the literature\u2019 (Antony 2001, 30).  Contemporary \ntheorists of consciousness are not trying to account for the sleeping\/waking cycle.  \nSuppose creature consciousness signifies something more substantive, something that \nis more closely related to notions like awareness and experience.  Antony argues that \nthis does not introduce a distinct notion of \u2018consciousness\u2019.  The apparent semantic \nvariability can be explained in terms of semantic modulation relative to a core \nsemantic base notion of consciousness.  So, like McBride, he seeks to undermine the \nidea that the creature\/state consciousness distinction specifies an ontological \ndistinction between different kinds of property.  He offers an analogy by way of \nclarification. \n \n[C]onsider the word \u2018corrupt\u2019 in the expressions \u2018corrupt government\u2019 and \n\u2018corrupt politician\u2019.  \u2018Corrupt\u2019 refers to distinct properties when applied to \norganizations and individuals no less than does \u2018consciousness\u2019 when \napplied to creatures and states.  But it surely does not follow that \u2018corrupt\u2019 \nis ambiguous between \u201cindividual corruption\u201d and \u201corganizational \ncorruption.\u201d  A more plausible view is that \u2018corrupt\u2019 is univocal, and \nmodulation is taking place, with different properties being highlighted \nacross contexts.  And so similarly with \u2018consciousness\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis states \nand creatures.  (Antony 2001, 30-31).  \n \n \n  \n \n8\nThough it may not (yet) be obvious, this passage is extremely instructive.  Antony\u2019s \nanalogy involves a semantic misinterpretation.  \u2018Corrupt\u2019 in this example is being \nused as an attributive adjective.  In such a context it is not being used predicatively \nand thus does not refer to any properties at all.  It is being used to restrict the \nreference class of the noun-phrase it modifies.  So what?  This may seem to be a \nneedless, over-fussy, nit-picking point.  How can this possible matter to our \ndiscussion of the ambiguity of \u2018consciousness\u2019? \nIt is arguable (and it will be argued in a moment) that a proper understanding \nof the creature\/state consciousness distinction requires a clear and focused \nunderstanding of the semantics of attributive adjectival modification.  By engaging in \na more detailed semantic, and historical, analysis of the notion of state consciousness \nwe not only expose some of the flaws in this kind of univocalism, but we will be \nprovided with the explicit material that we need to properly understand just why \nconsciousness is both polysemic and ambiguous. \n \n3.  The semantics of state consciousness \n \n3.1. States of consciousness, NOT state consciousness \n \nThere is a deep ambiguity in the notion of a conscious state and related notions like a \nstate of consciousness.  A state is a mode or condition of something.  Many \npredicative adjectives can be used to claim that some object or person is a certain \nway, or, as we might say, that they are in a certain state.  For example: \n \n(a1) The volcano is dormant. \n  \n \n9\n(a2) The volcano is in a dormant state. \n \nThis grammatical move is not legitimate for all predicative adjectives (e.g. \u2018Tom is \nloud\u2019; \u2018Cake is tasty\u2019).  In English it may be that the shift from the predicative use of \nthe adjective to the attributive use introduces a change in meaning (e.g., from \u2018Tom is \nterrible\u2019 to \u2018Tom is in a terrible state\u2019; from \u2018Sue is American\u2019 to \u2018Sue is in an \nAmerican state\u2019).  But predicative adjectives like \u2018swollen\u2019, \u2018conscious\u2019, \u2018alert\u2019, and \n\u2018attentive\u2019, all allow a legitimate move from predication to \u2018state\u2019 talk without \nmuch change in meaning.   \n Consider a second example. \n \n(b1) Tom is conscious. \n(b2) Tom is in a conscious state. \n \nEven though (b2) involves talk of a conscious state, it does not introduce the \nnotion of state consciousness as it features in contemporary philosophy of mind, for \nwe are not predicating consciousness of the state.  Tom\u2019s state is one of \nconsciousness.  But his state isn\u2019t conscious.  A parallel holds for property nouns \nlike \u2018condition\u2019.  To say that a person\u2019s condition is stable is to say what the \ncondition is; it is not to predicate of the condition that it, as well as the person, is \nstable.  Now consider a third type of example. \n  \n(a1) The volcano is dormant. \n(a3) The volcano is in a state of dormancy.   \n \n  \n \n10\n(b1) Tom is conscious. \n(b3) Tom is in a state of consciousness. \n \nHere we have formed abstract nouns from the predicate.  But here dormancy is still \na property of the volcano, not of the state.  Similarly, consciousness is a property of \nTom, not of his state.  Talk of a conscious state or a state of consciousness need not \nbring in anything other than creature consciousness. If we unpack the notion of a \nconscious state in this way then the univocalist might seem to be correct: talk of \nstates of consciousness is just a way of talking about states of creature \nconsciousness and thus no new notion of consciousness is drawn upon her.   \n  \n3.2. The epistemic conscious\/unconscious contrast  \n \nIf the notion of a conscious state is just a variant on creature consciousness \npredication, where does the idea that we can predicate consciousness of mental states \ncome from?  The modern notion of mental state consciousness emerges, in semantic \nterms at least, by way of the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental \nstates.  \u2018Conscious\u2019 is, etymologically, an epistemic notion (**** 2002a).  The \noriginal and primary use of \u2018conscious\u2019 in English, from the early seventeenth century \nonwards, is as a predicative adjective applied to people (not mental states).  It is used \nas a prepositional adjective (\u2018conscious of\u2019; \u2018conscious unto\u2019; \u2018conscious with\u2019) to \ndenote a person\u2019s knowledge of some matter, or to denote shared knowledge between \nparties.2  It is also used as part of a predicative adjectival \u2018that\u2019-clause construction \n                                                 \n2  \u2018All that I ever did shee's conscious of, and jealous of your love unto Hermione.\u2019 William Berkeley, \nThe lost lady: A Tragy Comedy. (London, John Colby, 1638) Act IV Scene 1. (p. 36) \n  \n \n11\n(\u2018S is conscious that p\u2019).3  At roughly the same time (early seventeenth century), we \nfind \u2018conscious\u2019 being used attributively.  First, in a poetic or metaphorical way to \nsuggest that certain inanimate things share knowledge with human beings.4  Second, \nby way of emphasising the fact that a subject, or some subject-like entity (the soul, \none\u2019s \u2018heart\u2019) knows something, or is capable of knowledge.5  By the eighteenth \ncentury the attributive use of \u2018conscious\u2019 has become common in English literature, \nmodifying mental terms like belief, desire, hope and will.  But we do not find the \npredication of \u2018consciousness\u2019 of mental states.   \nSo where does the notion of state consciousness come from then?  Because \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 is an epistemic notion, it was readily adopted as a technical term for \nthe special kind of knowledge that each of us has of our own minds.6  \n\u2018Consciousness\u2019 becomes synonymous with \u2018self-knowledge\u2019, and specifies a \nrelational property between a subject and her mental states. Consciousness involves a \nkind of higher-order knowledge of one\u2019s first-order mental states. In the late \nnineteenth century psychologists started to ascribe intentional states that seemed not \nto be knowable by their subjects in a direct first-personal way (****, 2000b).  This \nrelational higher-order epistemic notion of consciousness was re-deployed to mark a \ncontrast within the class of mental states.  Conscious mental states are known by their \n                                                 \n3 \u2018Because they play the Fool, conscious that it will please.\u2019 George Farquhar,  Love and a bottle. \n(London: Richard Standfast, 1699) Act IV (p. 43). \n4 \u2018Yet I am mad, I rave and tear my self, traverse my guilty chamber in a disorder'd, but a soft \nconfusion; and often opening the conscious curtains, survey the print where thou and I were last night \nlaid.\u2019 Aphra Behn, Love-Letters Between a Noble-Man And his Sister, (1684), \u2018To Philander, After the \nHappy Night,\u2019 Part 1   \n5 \u2018Then Feliche stabd (Whose sinking thought frighted my conscious hart) and laid by Mellida, to stop \nthe match,\u2019 John Marston,, ANTONIO'S Reuenge. The second part of the Historie of Antonio and \nMellida. (1602); \u2018Euen such would be your life, whose guilt each houre would strike your conscious \nsoule with terrors\u2019 Robert Daborne,  A Christian turn'd Turke. OR, The Tragicall Liues and Deaths of \nthe two Famous Pyrates, WARD and DANSIKER. (1612)  (Act 1, Scene 4). \n6 For example Locke held that \u2018Consciousness is the perception of what passes in a Man\u2019s own mind\u2019 \n(Locke 1959 [1690] II i 9), whilst Reid observed that \u2018consciousness\u2019 signifies \u2018that immediate \nknowledge which we have of our present thoughts and purposes, and, in general, of all the present \noperations of our minds\u2019 (Reid 1785, I.i). \n  \n \n12\nsubject in a direct first-personal way, whilst unconscious ones are not.  This same \nnotion of consciousness underpins the distinction between conscious and unconscious \nmentality in psychoanalytic theory, and also, at least in part, in cognitive science (e.g., \nChomsky\u2019s unconscious knowledge of grammar (Chomsky 1980)).  It has also re-\nsurfaced in theorising about consciousness in higher-order thought theories of mental \nstate consciousness (Rosenthal 1997; Lycan 1996; Carruthers 1998). \n \n3.3. From classification to predication: the emergence of state consciousness \n \nThe distinction between conscious and unconscious mental states is a classificatory \none.  When we talk of a conscious belief, a conscious sensation, a conscious desire, a \nconscious mental state, \u2018conscious\u2019 is being used as an attributive adjective.  \nAttributive uses of adjectives, as was noted above with reference to Antony\u2019s \u2018corrupt \npolitician\u2019 example, effect a restriction upon, or a narrowing of, the reference class of \nthe noun-phrase that they modify: e.g., rural policeman; dental floss; dental surgeon; \ncriminal lawyer (Bolinger 1967).  Predicative adjectival use, by way of contrast, \nallows the speaker to state something about an object.  The semantic notion of \nsatisfaction, introduced by Tarski (1944) provides a tidy way of spelling out the \nsemantics of predicates, including predicative adjectives.  In Tarski\u2019s schema, an \nobject satisfies a predicate \u2018F\u2019 if and only if that object is F.  This works fine for \n\u2018red\u2019, \u2018ugly\u2019, \u2018bigger than the Eiffel Tower\u2019 and so on.  This kind of semantic analysis \njust doesn\u2019t work for attributive adjectival modification.  Suppose we try to substitute \n\u2018dental\u2019 for \u2018F\u2019 in Tarski\u2019s semantic schema.  First we fail to get a well-formed \nexpression (\u2018O is dental\u2019) on the right-hand side of the \u2018if and only if\u2019 (signalling the \nnon-predicating nature of dental).  But, second, such a schema fails to take account of \n  \n \n13\nthe fact that \u2018dental\u2019 seems to vary in its meaning depending upon the noun-phrase \nmodified.  A person is a dental surgeon in virtue of being a doctor who operates on \nteeth.  But pieces of string are dental floss in virtue of their aptness for use in cleaning \nbetween teeth.  On the other hand, a space is a dental cavity in virtue of being located \nwithin a tooth.  An appointment is a dental appointment in virtue of being made with \na party who operates upon or examines teeth.  There is semantic variation here, but \nwhen we spell out the meaning in each case, there is a constant semantic element, an \nimplicit reference to teeth.  Let us follow linguists in referring to this common feature \nas the semantic base notion for the attributive adjective (Aarts & Calbert 1979).  \nIn order to use Tarski\u2019s schema to spell out the semantics of nonpredicating \nadjectives we need to have predication on both sides.  We can talk of an object\u2019s \nbeing a dental drill, of a person being a dental surgeon and so on.  This secures \npredication on the left-hand side.  As for giving the semantics in terms of satisfaction \nwe can use Aarts and Calbert\u2019s concept of a predicational relator to denote the \nvarious ways in which an attributive adjective relates to a single base semantic notion \ndepending on the noun-phrase modified (Aarts & Calbert 1979).  In our example \nabove, the base semantic notion is that of teeth whilst the predicational relators \ninclude: \u2018. . operates on . .\u2019; \u2018. . is used to clean . .\u2019; \u2018. . is within . .\u2019.  A drill is a dental \ndrill if and only if it used to operate on teeth.  A person will only understand what a \ndental drill is, only if (a) they know what the semantic base notion is and (b) know \nthe appropriate predicational relator  (e.g., \u2018dental drill\u2019 might, in certain contexts, \nrefer to a drill made of teeth).  Whilst attributive adjectival modification exhibits a \npuzzling semantic variability, we explain that variability by appeal to the variety of \npredicational relators whilst establishing an underlying semantic unity via the single \nsemantic base notion.  Dental things are all bound up with teeth in some way or other.   \n  \n \n14\n We are now in a position to see how the contemporary notion of mental state \nconsciousness emerges out of a long process of abstraction and semantic meandering.  \nWe begin with the everyday predicative use of \u2018is conscious\u2019 as an epistemic term.  \nPhilosophers co-opt \u2018consciousness\u2019 as a technical term for knowledge of mind.  \nPsychologists introduce the classificatory distinction between conscious and \nunconscious mental states, drawing upon the higher-order epistemic notion of \nconsciousness.  The only predicative use of \u2018conscious\u2019 so far is with regard to people \nor creatures.  Psychoanalytic theorists needed some way of talking about the changing \nstatus of repressed mental material and, with these concerns in mind, talk of repressed \nideas becoming conscious, being conscious, failing to be conscious and so on, \nbecomes pertinent (and saves the theorist from using long-winded locutions like \n\u2018becoming available to first-person self-knowledge\u2019).  The key point in the emergence \nof a notion of state consciousness is the introduction of a purely predicative use of \n\u2018conscious\u2019 (in the epistemic sense) with regard to mental states.  Once we have the \npredicative notion in play we can then, as we saw above, form a de-adjectival abstract \nnoun \u2018consciousness\u2019.  But we already have a notion of consciousness in play (i.e., \nepistemic consciousness as predicated of people).  In order to avoid conflation and \nconfusion we introduce the notion of state consciousness as a label for the epistemic \nproperty (being known in a first-personal way) that certain mental states have. \nState consciousness is thus quite unlike the notion of a state of consciousness.  \nThe latter is a way of talking about creature consciousness, the former is a way of \ntalking about certain (epistemic) features of mental states.  The state \nconsciousness\/creature consciousness distinction is as real as the distinction between \n(a) being a knower; (b) being known.   \n  \n  \n \n15\n4.  Some more strands of consciousness \n \nThough there is something in common, semantically speaking, between state \nconsciousness and creature consciousness, they are distinct phenomena and, given \nthat they both are referred to as species of consciousness it seems that there is a \nstanding risk of conflating them (indeed, both Antony and McBride\u2019s \u2018grammatical\u2019 \nobjections seem to reflect an underlying conflation of state consciousness with the \nnotion of a state of consciousness, and thus adds further support to the thesis that \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 is ambiguous).  We could, at this point, stop and address the question \nwhether the state\/creature consciousness distinction really counts as an instance of \npolsyemy and ambiguity.  But we have barely scratched the surface of the polysemy \nof \u2018consciousness\u2019.  Matters are much, much worse for the univocalist who holds that \nwe have a common, shared understanding of what \u2018consciousness\u2019 refers to.  \n \n4.1. First-order epistemic consciousness \n \nWe have seen that the original semantic base notion for \u2018conscious mental state\u2019 is a \nnotion of creature consciousness: the epistemic notion of someone being conscious of \nsome object or fact.  This base notion is a relational one (a subject\u2019s knowing of \nsomething).  Whilst mental states are the objects of consciousness (in Locke\u2019s sense) \nit is also true that knowledge is a relation that is instituted via mental states.  We are \nconscious of nonmental objects and states of affairs.  A conscious mental state can be \nviewed as one that we are aware of something through.  This provides us with an \nalternative, but still epistemic, notion of mental state consciousness, one that is \ndistinct from the higher-order conception.  In contemporary thought, Dretske draws \n  \n \n16\nupon this first-order epistemic notion of consciousness when he states that \n\u2018experiences and beliefs are conscious, not because you are conscious of them, but \nbecause, so to speak, you are conscious with them\u2019 (Dretske 1993, 280).  A conscious \nbelief, in Dretske\u2019s view \u2018is a representation that makes one conscious of the fact (that \np) that it is a belief about\u2019 (Dretske 1993, 280).   \n The epistemic semantic basis of \u2018consciousness\u2019 makes it fit to do duty as a \ntechnical term for our perception and knowledge of the world, or as a technical term \nfor our knowledge of our own minds.  Relative to the single semantic base notion of a \nsubject\u2019s being conscious of something we can identify two different, equally \nlegitimate, predicational relators for \u2018conscious mental state\u2019:  \n \n(a)  A mental state is a conscious mental state if and only if it is an object of \nknowledge (of a certain kind). \n(b)  A mental state is a conscious mental state if and only if it is a state of knowing of \nsomething or, a state via which one knows of something.   \n \nSo far we have been focusing on semantic variation relative to a single semantic base \nnotion (epistemic consciousness).  In some cases there is potentially more than one \nsemantic base notion for a single lexical term used attributively.  Language is a \ndynamic, fluid affair.  Some terms come to be used in a new way, even whilst the \nolder use remains.  Prior to 1950, \u2018gay\u2019 used attributively had a meaning quite \ndifferent to its contemporary one.  When Wordsworth talks of a \u2018choir of gay \ncompanions\u2019 the semantic base notion is not the contemporary one.7  Here, unlike the \n\u2018metal box\u2019 example, the risk of conflation is at the level of the semantic base notion.  \n  \n \n17\nWe find the same kind of semantic shift, at the level of semantic base notion, with \nregard to \u2018conscious\u2019. \n \n4.2. Experiential or phenomenal consciousness \n \nIn our story above, \u2018consciousness\u2019 is an epistemic term of everyday English that has \nbeen put to work in various philosophical and psychological contexts.  But \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 has also been used, and continues to be used, in a nonepistemic way. \n\u2018Consciousness\u2019 in the traditional philosophical epistemic sense is bound up with \nknowledge of mind.  We know of our mental states in a direct first-personal way.  \nWhen we reflect upon the nature of our own minds, especially when we reflect upon \nthe nature of our current experience, we seem to identify something determinate: \nstates that are like something independently of our knowing of them to so (pace \nDennett 1992).  Our waking mental life seems to involve a stream of events that have \na distinctive subjective ontological character (e.g., you don\u2019t feel my pains).  \n\u2018Consciousness\u2019 has long been used as a label for the subjective ontological features \nthat seem to be both independent of, and the basis of, our knowledge of mind.  Rather \nthan viewing \u2018consciousness\u2019 as an abstract epistemic noun, \u2018consciousness\u2019 becomes \nthe label of something more concrete, \u2018consciousness\u2019 is viewed as denoting some \nkind of subjective ontological phenomena, something that can be described using \nspatial metaphors like \u2018stream\u2019 or \u2018field\u2019.   \nAlmost two centuries ago, William Hamilton, in his Lectures on Metaphysics \ndelivered in 1836, outlined a dispute between philosophers who \u2018say that \nconsciousness is a knowledge\u2019  and \u2018many others\u2019 who \u2018have defined consciousness \n                                                                                                                                            \n7 William Wordsworth, The Excursion \u2018Despondency\u2019 \u2018In the devotedness of youthful love, preferring \n  \n \n18\nas a feeling\u2019 (Hamilton 1859, Vol 1., 191).  Forty years later, Alexander Bain in \ncataloguing the \u2018various significations\u2019 of the term \u2018consciousness\u2019 argued against \nHamilton that \u2018the knowledge or attention, although an accompaniment of the state, is \nnot its foundation\u2019 (Bain 1879, 94).  Half a century after that we find McDougall  \n(1923) bemoaning the fact that \u2018\u201cconsciousness\u201d is generally taken to be almost, if not \nquite, synonymous with \u201cexperience\u201d\u2019 (McDougall  1923, 16).  McDougall suggests \nthat  \u2018\u201cconsciousness,\u201d if it is used at all, should be used to mean \u201cthe act of knowing \nor thinking of things\u201d\u2019 and that \u2018the word \u201cconscience\u201d would have been a better \nword than \u201cconsciousness\u201d for psychological purposes\u2019 (1923, 16).  And, in recent \nyears we find Ned Block arguing at length that cognitive theorists conflate an \nexperiential, non-representational (and thus nonepistemic) notion of consciousness \n(phenomenal consciousness) with another epistemic notion of consciousness \n(awareness, or access-consciousness) (Block 1995; 1997).   \n We have not space to explore this rich historical (and contemporary) debate \nhere.  For our purposes what matters is that we seem to be able to (fairly readily) \nidentify a second, nonepistemic semantic base notion for \u2018consciousness\u2019 and \n\u2018conscious mental state\u2019.  The semantic base notion, as with the epistemic notions \ndiscussed above, is a notion of creature consciousness (its being like something for a \ncreature).  The predicational relator is that of making a contribution to what it is like \nfor that creature.  Or, to put it in more familiar terms: \n \n(c) A mental state is a conscious mental state if and only if it is like something for a \nsubject to be in it, or have it. \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nme to parents, and the choir of gay companions, to the natal roof\u2019 (lines 506-7) \n  \n \n19\nEarlier we construed the state\/creature consciousness distinction in epistemic terms.  \nBut we can also construe it in experiential, or phenomenal, terms: creature \nconsciousness is a matter of its being like something for subject; state consciousness \nis constituted by state\u2019s making a contribution to what it is like for that subject.  \nGiven that all state consciousness, creature consciousness, in its epistemic and \nexperiential guises might all casually be referred to using \u2018consciousness\u2019 it seems \ninescapable that \u2018consciousness\u2019 is deeply polysemic and ambiguous.8 \n \n5.  Five problems for univocalism \n \nOur analysis in terms of predicational relators and semantic bases has a good deal in \ncommon with Antony\u2019s \u2018semantic modulation\u2019 account.  So far it seems to differ in at \nleast the following two respects.  First, we have accepted the reality of the distinction \nbetween creature consciousness and state consciousness.  Second, we have identified \ntwo distinct semantic base notions for consciousness (epistemic, experiential).  Third, \nwe have a more subtle and articulate way of showing why different notions of \nconsciousness should arise from these semantic base notions via different \npredicational relators. \n One line of response open to the univocalist is to stress, as Antony does, that \nthe core notion of consciousness is a complex, multi-faceted one (Antony 2001, 29).  \nOn this univocalist view our conception of mind supports what we might call a single \nbut knotty conception of consciousness.  In different contexts different strands of the \nknot of consciousness are brought to the fore.  We can explain away the polysemy of \n                                                 \n8 Matters become even more complex if we view consciousness as a dispositional notion: e.g., a \nconscious belief is one that is disposed to be conscious (this could mean, one that is disposed to be an \n  \n \n20\n\u2018consciousness\u2019 in terms of semantic modulation relative to the single knot of \nconsciousness.  So, even though we seem to have identified a deep ambiguity in the \nnotion of consciousness, Antony might claim that our semantic analysis hasn\u2019t gone \ndeep enough.  Epistemic and experiential consciousness are really just different facets \nof, a more fundamental complex phenomenon and it is this complex phenomenon that \nis the proper semantic core notion for \u2018consciousness\u2019. \nThere is something right about this (and something problematic, as we shall \nsee).  Our perceptual experience of the world is constituted by states that exhibit all \nthree of the species of state consciousness introduced above and our status as \nconscious subjects is interdependent with the conscious status of our mental states.  \nWe are conscious of the world via our perceptual events; it is like something to be in, \nor be the subject of, such events; we know of such events in a direct first-personal \nway.  Perceptual events exhibit phenomenal consciousness and both kinds of \nepistemic consciousness noted above.  The univocalist will, quite rightly, stress that \nthere is a sense in which all these elements seem to be unified together in a single \nexperiential point of view. Even if all this is true, however, it does not secure \nunivocalism.  Here are five reasons why not. \n   \n5.1.  The consensus problem \n \nAntony\u2019s univocalism rests upon the observation that \u2018there is a general sense of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 that enjoys widespread use\u2019 (2001, 25).  Antony alludes to the \nappearance of the term \u2018consciousness\u2019 in the title of various journals and books and \ncites works by Baars, Crick and Koch, and Chalmers.  But, unfortunately for Antony, \n                                                                                                                                            \nobject of higher-order thought, or disposed to be a first-order state of awareness of something, or, \n  \n \n21\nit is not at all clear that these theorists view consciousness in the same way at all.  \nCrick and Koch ask \u2018When is an animal conscious?\u2019 (Crick and Koch 1997, 279), \nthey are thus concerned with the question of what it is for a brain or a creature to be \nconscious.  Baars, by way of contrast, very clearly stresses that he is interested in the \ncontrast between conscious and unconscious mental states and processes (Baars 1988, \n70).  Chalmers is keen to narrow \u2018consciousness\u2019 to experiential consciousness and, \nlike McBride above, argues that \u2018what is central to consciousness . . . is experience\u2019 \n(Chalmers 1996, 4). \n There is a troubling line of inference here.  Antony holds that \u2018consciousness\u2019 \npicks out the complex knot of experience, self-knowledge, intentionality and so on.  It \nis true that the various theorists cited by Antony all write upon one or more of these \nphenomena, but that does not mean that they all accept that \u2018consciousness\u2019 picks out \none and the same knot: what seems more plausible is that they pick out one or more \nstrands of that knot.  What Antony needs to establish his non-ambiguity claim is a \nwidespread acceptance of the same complex of features as the referent of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019.  We cannot establish this in an aggregative way.  For example, \nsuppose I claim that the common, accepted referent of \u2018consciousness\u2019 is a complex \nphenomenon exhibiting properties F,G,H, I, J.  If one theorist takes \u2018consciousness\u2019 to \npick out F, G, H; another, G, H, I, and the third takes it to pick out H, I, J, then it is \ntrue that all are agreed that \u2018consciousness\u2019 is a complex phenomena, but they \ndisagree as to which complex phenomenon it is.  I cannot aggregate their particular \ncommitments into a commitment to the compound phenomenon that I take \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 to refer to. \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nperhaps one that is disposed to be like something for the subject). \n  \n \n22\n5.2. The unwittingness problem \n \nIf there really is a shared commitment to viewing \u2018consciousness\u2019 as a particular \ncomplex phenomenon, why is there widespread, ongoing, discussion about the many \nmeanings of \u2018consciousness\u2019?  Why is there a widespread practice of explicitly \nclassifying \u2018consciousness\u2019 into its sub-variants?  Do we lack knowledge of what we \nreally mean when we talk about \u2018consciousness\u2019?   \nIt seems to be precisely because we know that \u2018consciousness\u2019 is ambiguous \nthat we engage in all this sub-classification of different notions of consciousness.  The \nunivocalist, one assumes, will argue that this is some kind of error on our part.  But \nthis is no good.  The univocalist case rests upon a de facto shared conception of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 as the basis for rejecting the ambiguity view.  What the univocalist \nneeds is to establish a prior common acceptance of a single notion of consciousness \nas the semantic core and, if there is widespread acceptance of ambiguity, the \nunivocalist\u2019s claim of a prior consensus is seriously undermined. \n \n5.3. The consciousness-conferring properties problem \n \nSuppose we allow Antony\u2019s claim that there is some compound general sense of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 that includes epistemic and experiential variants of consciousness.  \nSuppose, for the sake of argument, that people agree about the extension of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019, that it picks out just one specific complex of properties.  We cannot \ninfer from the fact that there is agreement about the extension of \u2018consciousness\u2019 that \ntheorists thereby mean the same thing by \u2018consciousness\u2019.  For example, suppose \nTom uses the predicative adjective \u2018squiffy\u2019 to denote creatures with hearts and Sue \n  \n \n23\nuses \u2018squiffy\u2019 to denote creatures with kidneys.  Tom and Sue agree about which \ncreatures are squiffy, but this does not mean that squiffiness is not an ambiguous \nconcept.  Tom and Sue differ with regard to which properties are the squiffiness-\nconferring ones, and should they encounter\u2014or perhaps imagine, via thought \nexperiments\u2014unusual cases where they encounter a creature with a heart but without \nkidneys, the differences in their conception of squiffiness will come to the fore. \nThe same point applies in theorising about consciousness.  In contemporary \nwriting on the mind experiential consciousness has come to the fore as the favoured \nconsciousness-conferring property.  Intentional features of mind get to be conscious \ninsofar as they exhibit phenomenal or experiential properties.  Eric Lormand, for \nexample, argues that \u2018phenomenal consciousness is the most basic kind of \nconsciousness\u2019 (Lormand 1996,  255).  Burge insists that \u2018phenomenal consciousness \nis the core notion\u2019 of consciousness. (Burge 1997, 429).  Marcel avows that \n\u2018Phenomenal experience is [. . .] the raison d\u2019etre of the concept of consciousness\u2019 \n(Marcel 1988, 128).   \n But not everyone agrees.  Lycan, by way of contrast, informs us: \u2018I cannot \nmyself hear a natural sense of the phrase \u2018conscious state\u2019 other than as meaning \n\u2018state one is conscious of being in\u2019\u2019 (Lycan 1996, 25).  Other higher-order though \ntheorists agree with Lycan.  Lycan and Burge might agree about the extension of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 but this is only because in normal human experience the candidate \nconsciousness-conferring properties (i.e., those favoured by different thinkers) tend to \nbe co-instantiated.  The states that are like something to be in are also states that we \nknow of first-personally.   \n When we move away from the paradigm case of human perceptual experience, \ndifferences as to which properties are the consciousness-conferring ones come to the \n  \n \n24\nfore.  For example, when we think of animal consciousness, Burge and Marcel might \nbe quite happy to allow a bat to have consciousness even without the capacity for \nself-knowledge or higher-order representation.  For Lycan, by way of contrast, this is \nincoherent.  Working in the other direction, Lycan is quite happy to allow that pocket \ncalculators and computers might be conscious insofar as they instantiate higher-order \nmonitoring relations even if it is not like anything for the calculator.  For those who \nprioritise phenomenal consciousness, this seems entirely misguided. \n  \n5.4. The differential treatment problem \n \nPart of the intuitive support for univocalism comes from the fact that our waking \nexperiential life typically co-instantiates the various phenomena that have come to be \ncalled \u2018consciousness\u2019.  This might make it seem that we have some tacit idea of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 as this complex of co-instantiated properties.  One problem here is \nthat our contemporary metaphysics of mind treats these various facets of our \nexperiential life differentially.  Contemporary functionalists and cognitive theorists \nview mental states as functional states and intentional properties as causal relational \nproperties.  The key point here is that epistemic relational properties like awareness \nand self-knowledge seem to be more readily explicable in functional causal terms \nthan putative nonrelational intrinsic properties like qualia (Block 1978; Levine 2001; \n**** 2002c).  From the point of view of contemporary functionalism one of the \nstrands of consciousness is viewed as being fundamentally more problematic than the \nothers (**** 2002a).  This has an effect upon how theorists use the term \n\u2018consciousness\u2019.  There is a tendency to use the term \u2018consciousness\u2019 as shorthand for \n\u2018those putatively non-representational properties that functionalism cannot deal with\u2019.  \n  \n \n25\n\u2018Consciousness\u2019 gets to be associated with phrases like \u2018the problem of \nconsciousness\u2019.  The problem of consciousness is prised apart from the problem of \nrepresentational mind, and of self-representation.  Because we use our technical \nphilosophical language to pick out features of concern to us, the extension of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 in a lot of contemporary functionalist writing is narrowed to \nexperience (as we saw above in the remarks from Lormand, Marcel, Chalmers and \nBurge).  The traditional Lockean epistemic conception is kept on the go by higher-\norder representation theorists.  Once again, when we examine the conceptual \ncommitments of current theory, we find polysemy and ambiguity. \n \n5.5.  Consciousness-independence and the state consciousness problem \n \nFunctionalism and causal-representational theories provide contemporary theorising \nwith a consciousness-independent conception of mind in both the epistemic and \nmetaphysical senses of \u2018consciousness\u2019 (Searle 1992, 10; McGinn 1991; **** 2002c).  \nThat is, there is no assumption that mental states, qua mental, must be known by their \nsubjects in a first-person way; no assumption that all representational states are states \nvia which some subject is conscious of something; nor is it assumed that it must be \nlike something for a subject to have a mental state.  Functionalists can conceive of \nconsciousness as a property that mental states have because they believe that \nmentality is something more fundamental than conscious mentality (be it in the \nepistemic, or in the experiential sense).   \n John Searle, a vocal anti-functionalist, cannot conceive of consciousness in \nthis way.  Consciousness cannot be a property that some mental states have, and that \nothers lack, because \u2018consciousness\u2019, as used by Searle, denotes the subjective \n  \n \n26\nontological medium of mind (Searle\u2019s notion of a unconscious state is of a brain state \nthat is disposed to give rise to conscious mentality (Searle 1992)).  For Searle, \nconsciousness is not a property of mental states, mental states are determinations, or \nmodifications of the \u2018field\u2019 of consciousness (Searle 1999, 82).  Consciousness is \nalways creature consciousness for Searle: \u2018What I mean by \u201cconsciousness\u201d can best \nbe illustrated by examples.  When I wake up from a dreamless sleep.  I enter a state of \nconsciousness, a state that continues as long as I am awake\u2019 (Searle 1992, 84). \n Because theorists differ with regard to the question of how consciousness (in \nits various guises) relates to mentality, \u2018consciousness\u2019 cannot be used in the same \nway by all theorists.  It is thus hard to see how the univocalist can claim that there is \nan underlying conception of consciousness that is shared by contemporary theorists. \n \n6.  Conclusion \n \n\u2018Consciousness\u2019 is both polysemic and ambiguous.  McBride and Antony\u2019s arguments \ndo not show otherwise.  But the analysis offered here does not just play a negative \nrole in undermining the case for univocalism about \u2018consciousness\u2019.  It plays a \npositive role too.  First, it lets us see just why \u2018consciousness\u2019 means the many things \nthat it does.  Our analysis explains why \u2018consciousness\u2019 is polysemic and ambiguous.  \n\u2018Consciousness\u2019 and \u2018conscious\u2019 have been to work in various metaphysical, \nphilosophical and explanatory contexts.  The most substantive metonymic shift is \nfrom the traditional epistemic notion of consciousness to the experiential notion.  A \nsecond source of the polysemic nature of \u2018consciousness\u2019 is the shift from using \n\u2018conscious\u2019 predicatively of human beings to using it attributively with regard to \nmental states.  This shift began with the new practice of making explanatory appeal to \n  \n \n27\n(epistemically) unconscious mental states and has now been firmly entrenched thanks \nto the ascendancy of functionalism and causal-representational theories of mind. \n Second, by laying stress on the fact that the various species of consciousness \ntend to be co-instantiated the account here alerts us to the difficulty of achieving \nclarity in this area.  Different theorists may agree about the extension of \n\u2018consciousness\u2019 for very different reasons.  We need to be alert to the distinction \nbetween an extensional characterisation of \u2018consciousness\u2019 on the one hand and, on \nthe other, a characterisation in terms of finely-tuned consciousness-conferring \nproperties.   \nThird, the abstract semantic analysis offered above allows us to clearly \nidentify some of the relationships amongst various notions of consciousness.  It \nreveals just where we need to keep notions distinct (e.g., epistemic versus experiential \nconsciousness; state versus creature consciousness) and where we do not (creature \nconsciousness versus states of consciousness).  This points us towards the formulation \nof a shared technical vocabulary.  There is, I take it, nothing wrong with the \nintroduction of technical language provided that the technical terms are used in a \nuniform way.  What we need to do is to rid ourselves of the risk of conflation, not \ngive up our theorizing about self-knowledge, awareness of the world and the nature of \nsubjective experience.  We cannot rule out a priori the possibility that, if good \npractice demands it, the best solution may be to cease to use \u2018consciousness\u2019 in our \ntheorising about mind (even if we continue to use the term in our historical \ndiscourse). \nThe univocalist view, by way of contrast, poses a real danger.  If we assume \nthat we all know what we mean when we talk about \u2018consciousness\u2019 and \u2018conscious \nmental states\u2019 then we are apt to become complacent.  We will shy away from trying \n  \n \n28\nto clarify what we mean, and will resist the temptation to introduce explicit technical \nvocabulary to do the work of disambiguating \u2018consciousness\u2019.  This may make for \nseemingly clearer technical exposition (and it may save a few trees en route), but the \ndownside is that the ever-spreading thicket that is the philosophy of consciousness is \nlikely to become so tangled as to be completely impenetrable.  We need to face up to \nthe ambiguity of \u2018consciousness\u2019 and to deal with it head on as best we can by \nclarifying what we mean when we talk about consciousness.  My hope is that the \nanalysis here establishes a justification for attempting such a clarification and also \nprovides an abstract framework that might help achieve it.   \n  \nReferences \n[references to author\u2019s own work deleted] \n \nAarts J. & Calbert J.
