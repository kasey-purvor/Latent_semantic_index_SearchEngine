The Act does not regulate the \ntaking or removal of tissue from living people for research, which remains governed by common law. \nBroadly, if researchers plan to use \u2018surplus\u2019 material \u2018left over\u2019 after biopsies, operations or other \nprocedures, then no separate consent to the procedure to take the tissue, over and above the \nnormal consent to treatment, is required. But if additional procedures are to be undertaken to \nobtain material specifically for research (e.g. extra biopsies), the patient must give separate consent \nfor this.4  The HT Act does require researchers to obtain consent for the storage and use of tissue for \nresearch purposes, though it also allows the storage and use of human tissue from the living without \nconsent provided that the research is ethically approved and the tissue is anonymised.5\n4\n  Stored or \n\u2018archived\u2019 tissue may also be used without consent following considerations about whether other \nsources of tissue are available, the feasibility of tracing and contacting donors, and the potential for \nthe research to discover information of clinical significance for donors or to cause them unnecessary \nfurther distress.   \n \nThe new legislation gives Research Ethics Committees (RECs) important roles in the governance of \nresearch involving human tissue, requiring RECs to make judgements about the appropriateness of \nconsent arrangements. RECs can approve applications to conduct studies where researchers aim to \naccess tissue without consent in cases where obtaining consent may be impractical or may cause \ndistress, but they can also choose to insist that consent be obtained if they deem it appropriate. The \nfear that RECs might show undue caution in making decisions about research involving human \ntissue, obstructing the conduct of potentially low risk and high value research, has been expressed \nby the Royal College of Pathologists,6 amongst others. There is also concern that aspects of the \nHuman Tissue Authority\u2019s (HTA) Codes of Practice might be problematic for RECs to interpret, \nincluding the lack of direct legislation about whether consent should be generic or specific.7\nDespite the concerns that the implementation of the Human Tissue Act could hamper important \nmedical research,\n  \n6 little is known about the impact of the Act on the work of Research Ethics \nCommittees.  The aim of this paper is to identify the ethical issues raised by RECs in the letters about \nuse of human tissue for research purposes, and to offer some insights the impact of the HT Act on \nthe concerns raised by RECs about the taking, storage and use of human tissue.  \n \nMETHODS \nWe analysed letters issued by NHS RECs in England and Wales to applicants following the first \nmeeting at which an application was considered. Letters were sampled from the National Research \nEthics Service\u2019s (NRES) Research Ethics Database. We aimed to analyse letters about applications \ninvolving the use of human tissue, including tissue from living donors and post-mortem tissues, and \nfrom children and adults, from both before and after the implementation of the HT Act.  The \ndefinition of \u2018tissue samples\u2019 included specific mention of \u2018tissue\u2019 but also any reference to the use \nof human material, e.g. blood, skin biopsies, paraffin blocks and so on.  \n \nWe aimed to analyse letters in two periods: first, a period when there was still legal uncertainty over \nstorage and use of human tissues for research, and second, a period immediately after the \nimplementation of the HT Act and when practical guidance was available.  We sampled 100 letters in \n4 \n \ntotal; this sample size was chosen for pragmatic reasons. Half of the letters were randomly sampled \nfrom a period we call \u2018Before\u2019 the implementation of the Act. This period covers 1 March 2004 (when \nthe database opened) up to and including 31st August 2005.  The Before period covers an era of \nconsiderable uncertainty about legal issues relating to research use of human tissue. The Human \nTissue Bill was first published in December 2003, but underwent very significant amendments before \nreceiving Royal Assent in November 2004.  Though the Act laid out a broad framework, many of the \ndetails remained unsettled for some time. The Human Tissue Authority came into being on 1 April \n2005, but its statutory functions did not begin until April 2006, when it launched its framework for \nlicensing. Eight detailed Codes of Practice to provide practical guidance were approved by the \nDepartment of Health and parliament and were published in July 2006.  The Act was implemented \nfor research purposes in September 2006, and licenses for storing human tissue for research \npurposes were also required from 1 September 2006.  The other half of our letters were randomly \nselected from a period we term \u2018After\u2019, between 1st September 2006 and 22nd December 2006. All \nletters related to applications where the applicants had indicated (via a tick box on the application \nform) that their project involved the use of tissue samples. \n \nLetters were included if they communicated a provisional opinion or an unfavourable opinion at first \nreview (Box 1); letters communicating favourable opinions were excluded as they contain no \nrequests for changes, offering little opportunity for analysis. We excluded letters where the final \ndecision was unknown, as well as letters in response to requests for protocol amendments and site-\nspecific assessments.   \n \nBox 1: Decisions RECs may make  \n\u2022 A \u2018favourable\u2019 opinion means that an application is approved without further revisions; these constitute \n~17% of decisions made by RECs at first consideration of an application.* \n\u2022 \u2018Provisional\u2019 opinions constitute ~66% of decisions at first review, and require applicants to make a \nresponse addressing issues raised in the letter before a final opinion can be issued. The final opinion may \nbe either favourable or unfavourable. \n\u2022 An \u2018unfavourable\u2019 opinion (~8% of all submissions) at first review amounts to a rejection. \n \nRECs may also decide that applications are \u2018outside remit\u2019.  \n \nSome applications are withdrawn (~10% before review and ~2% after a provisional opinion has been issued).  \n \n*Data based on the period October 2005-March 2008 from the NRES website and refer to all applications. \n \nContent analysis and ethnographic content analysis were used to analyse the letters. 8  The content \nof letters was coded to a set of categories derived from the \u2018requirements for a favourable opinion\u2019 \nin the Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees (GAfREC). 9 An additional \ngrounded set of categories was generated through inspection and comparison of letters used in a \nprevious study, 10\nStatistical analysis was not appropriate given the small numbers in our samples, but it was possible \nto offer simple counts of findings in particular categories and to compare these. \n and modified in response to the new data in this project. Explicit category \nspecifications aided data assignment to analytic categories, which was undertaken using QSR N6.  \n \nOur project was deemed by NRES not to require research ethics committee review as it was \nconsidered to be service evaluation. Letters were fully anonymised before analysis, and where \nappropriate identifying details have been modified or removed.  Quotations are labelled as \u2018A\u2019 for \nthe \u2018after HT Act\u2019 sample and \u2018B\u2019 for the \u2018before HT Act\u2019 sample. \n \n5 \n \nRESULTS  \nThere were 2640 applications for ethical approval to use human tissue in the Before period that \nreceived unfavourable\/provisional opinions, forming 26% of the total number of applications \nmeeting our inclusion criteria relating to unfavourable\/provisional opinions.  The After period \nincluded 423 applications for ethical approval to use human tissue that received \nunfavourable\/provisional opinions, forming 40% of the total applications meeting our decision \ninclusion criteria in that period. Of the 100 applications in our sample, 48\/50 in the Before sample \nand 45\/50 in the After sample received a provisional opinion followed by a favourable opinion, six (1 \nBefore & 5 After) received an unfavourable opinion at first review and one (1 Before & 0 After) \nreceived a provisional opinion followed by an unfavourable opinion.  Applications were to conduct a \nvariety of study types, and involved a mix of new tissue samples, archived tissue samples, tissues \ncollected specifically for research, and \u2018surplus\u2019 tissues (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Types of studies involving human tissue in applications before and after the HT Act \n Before HT Act After HT Act Total \nApplication to conduct a Clinical Trial of an Investigational \nMedicinal Product (CTIMP) \n23 18 41 \nApplication to conduct a non-CTIMP project 27 32 59 \nNew tissue samples only 33 42 75 \nArchived samples only 5 0 5 \nArchived and new tissue samples 12 8 20 \nTissue specifically collected for research only 34 31 65 \nSurplus tissue only 7 6 13 \nSpecifically collected tissue and surplus tissue 4 13 17 \n \nEthical issues raised  \nEthical issues raised in REC letters in response to these applications were similar to those found in a \nprevious analysis of REC decision letters across a wide range of study types,10 and there was little \ndifference in the nature of issues raised between the Before and After samples (Table 2).  Issues \nrelating to informed consent were most frequently raised, consistent with other applications for \nethical approval to conduct research. 10,11\n \n  Many (41) letters did not raise concerns specifically \nrelating to human tissue, but 27\/50 in the Before sample and 32\/50 in the After sample did identify \nethical troubles specifically related to tissue collection, storage or use.  \n Table 2: Issues raised in REC decision letters before and after the HT Act \nEthical issues  Before HT Act After HT Act Total letters \nInformed consent process 42 47 89 \nCare and protection of participants 27 27 54 \nDocumentation 27 26 53 \nScientific design and conduct 21 27 48 \nRecruitment of participants 25 22 47 \nProtection of participants\u2019 confidentiality 24 22 46 \nNon-GAfREC issues 9 15 24 \nCommunity considerations 1 5 6 \n \nInformed consent: general concerns  \nNineteen letters (32% of the 59 letters specifically mentioning ethical concerns relating to tissue) \naddressed the adequacy of the proposed consent process for human tissue.  Overall the proportion \nof concerns about informed consent about human tissue was lower in the After sample (7\/32, 22%) \nthan the Before sample (12\/27, 44%). \n   \n6 \n \nIn both the Before and After samples, RECs were concerned about the provision of information to \npatients and the adequacy of consent, relating to: who would be allowed to conduct research on the \ntissue; protection of the tissue samples; which countries the tissues would be sent to; and length of \nstorage. RECs were concerned about the need to gain consent specifically for genetic testing, in \nletters from both before and after the HT Act.  Such concerns about consent were more likely to \nfocus on the potential for \u2018moral\u2019 wrongs than direct risks of physical harm.   \n \nWhilst parents may accept the concept of research being done using their children\u2019s samples, \nsome may feel more strongly about whether it was done locally or samples transferred \nelsewhere to unknown researchers. (B1551, non-CTIMP, new and stored tissue, BEFORE) \n \nIf blood tests are to be used for genetic analysis then this should be described in the \ninformation sheet and added to the consent form. (A384, non-CTIMP, new and stored tissue, \nAFTER) \n \nConcerns about consent for taking tissue \nIn both the Before and After samples, RECs commented explicitly on the need for: clarity in \ninformation given to patients about whether procedures from which tissue samples would be \ncollected were part of normal care or were being undertaken specifically for research purposes; the \nneed to highlight any risks associated with additional procedures; and the need to obtain separate \nconsent to additional procedures. \n \nYou should be explicit in the PIS what procedures are additional to normal care, and what is \njust another test on an existing sample. (A73, non-CTIMP, new tissue only, AFTER) \n \nThe Consent Forms should have a separate clause allowing the participants to consent to \nhaving blood samples taken. (B400, non-CTIMP, new tissue only, BEFORE) \n \nInclude details of the risks of having the additional biopsies [...]. (A49, CTIMP, new and stored \ntissue, AFTER) \n \nConcerns about consent for using tissue \nIn the Before sample, 10 letters raised concerns relating to consent to the use of tissue, but only one \nletter raised such concerns in the After sample.  There was evidence in these 10 Before letters that \nRECs wanted to be reassured that researchers were taking appropriate steps to gain full informed \nconsent for any plans to use tissue.  \n \nThe Chair commented that the Pharmacogenetic Informed Consent Form needed to give \nspecific information to the volunteers and inform them of exactly what the samples were \ngoing to be used to research. (B244, CTIMP, new tissue only, BEFORE) \n \nSome of the Before letters reflected uncertainty and lack of clarity on the part of RECs about \nwhether insisting on separate informed consent for the use of tissue was the right thing to do in the \ncontext of certain studies, particularly where they involved stored or surplus tissue. However, RECs \nin the Before period seemed reluctant to approve research to be undertaken without consent, and \nshowed a tendency to err on the side of caution, requiring informed consent even when they \nseemed unsure if this was the best course of action.  \n \nThe Committee discussed the protocol at great lengths in particular where there was a real \nneed to formally obtain patient consent for the use of the redundant samples.  The current \nnational guidelines were felt to be very unclear and inconsistent regarding the use of such \n7 \n \ntissue.  Most members felt that the patients would be surprised at the need to give such \nconsent.[\u2026] The Committee\u2019s conclusion was to give a favourable ethical opinion [\u2026] of the \nresearch as presented\u2026. (B1684, non-CTIMP, stored tissue only, BEFORE) \n \nYour understanding was that under the new HTA locally organised research procedures could \ntake place without consent.  Chairman pointed out that this was not yet law \u2026Therefore the \ncommittee considered it would be safer to ensure that informed consent was obtained.  \n(B1551, non-CTIMP, new and stored tissue, BEFORE) \n \nIn the Before sample, RECs were sometimes willing to consider allowing the use of tissue without \nconsent, especially where consent would be impractical and insisting on consent would obstruct the \nprogress of potentially valuable research, but they also expressed some uneasiness about this. \n \nThe researcher states that most of the samples used will be from patients who have given \ntheir consent for their tissue samples to be used in any future studies. The committee would \nlike reassurance that consent will be obtained in all cases where it is possible to do so \n(archival material excepted).  (B2252, non-CTIMP, stored tissue only, BEFORE) \n  \nResearchers who held banked tissue, possibly obtained without consent\u2026 may wish to add it \nto the bank retrospectively.   You felt it would add significant value to the bank if it were \npossible to include such samples, and considered it impractical to go back to individuals to \nobtain consent.  Before making a decision committee would like to know what percentage of \nsamples were stored without consent. However the concept and principle of informed \nconsent was reinforced. (B1551, non-CTIMP, new and stored tissue, BEFORE) \n \nThere were clear indications in the Before sample that RECs were looking to the introduction of the \nHT Act to provide them with definitive guidance about what was acceptable. \n \nThe Committee felt that because of the Human Tissue Act they could offer approval for 2 \nyears, after which time the researcher would need to request an extension to continue, \nmaking any modifications required by the Human Tissue Act (B376, non-CTIMP, new tissue \nonly, BEFORE) \n \nIn the After sample, only one letter raised concerns about consent to use tissue. In this case, the  \nREC asked for clarification from the attending researcher and seemed comfortable to grant approval \nfor the research to go ahead without consent.  \n \nthe Committee queried whether consent would have been gained to use all the samples. \n<Named researcher> explained \u2026.samples pre-2002 may not always have complete \ndocumented consent status. <Named researcher> stated that he felt it would be ethical to \nuse this tissue unless specific objections were recorded. The Committee accepted this view. \n(A215, non-CTIMP, new and stored tissue, AFTER)  \n \nConcerns about consent for storing tissue \nConcerns relating to the storage of tissue were raised in 11 letters in the Before sample and six \nletters in the After sample.  In both the Before (7) and After (6) letters, RECs were concerned that \nparticipants should be informed about plans for the storage and future use of tissue, and that \ninformed consent should be obtained for this.  In the After sample there was some evidence that \nRECs were more explicit in their requirements about what information should be provided to \nparticipants in order for consent to be fully \u2018informed\u2019.  RECs were also more likely to refer to issues \n8 \n \nof anonymisation\/identifiability in relation to future use of the tissue in letters after the Act; the HT \nAct makes anonymisation of tissue a condition for storage and future research without consent.   \n \nIs it likely that any prospectively collected pancreatic tissue will remain after completion of \nthis research and will this be stored and used in future projects? If so, this should be made \nclear in the information sheet and provision for specific consent for this should be made in \nthe consent form.  (B839, non-CTIMP, new and stored tissue, BEFORE) \n                                    \nAn additional point should be added relating to the blood samples to say what will happen to \nthem and should include \u2026 possible intended use in future for research that cannot yet be \nspecified (and should be clear if further REC approval will be sought); who will have access; \nlevel of identifiability (for this study and storage for future studies); provision for destruction \netc.  (A1, non-CTIMP, new tissue only, AFTER)  \n \nYou will re-word the consent form to include that future use of samples would be \nanonymised. (A310, non-CTIMP, new tissue only, AFTER) \n \nIn both the Before and After samples, RECs seemed willing to accept consent to generic future use, \nwith the exception of a single letter in the After sample, where the REC expressed concern about the \npossibility of use of tissue beyond the scope of the proposed study.  \n \nReassure that the samples will only be used for the purpose of this study. (A78, non-CTIMP, \nnew tissue only, AFTER) \n \nThe most noticeable contrast between the Before and After letters related to the conditions \nattached to future use of the tissue. In the Before sample, RECs tended to draw on their own \nauthority as ethical gatekeepers to ensure that conditions relating to the future use of tissue were \nadhered to.  \n \nPatients would need to consent for storage and future use of this sample.  Members wish to \npoint out that any future analysis on these samples in research would need the approval of \nthe committee. (B2518, non-CTIMP, new tissue only, BEFORE) \n                                                   \nIn contrast, in the After sample, there was evidence of RECs drawing on the provisions of the HT Act \nas a source of authority as to the legal conditions incumbent on storing data for future use, and of \nincreased consistency in their advice about the range of options that researchers could follow for \nstoring and using the tissue in future research.   \n \nAs you have made a project based application to the Committee, the storage of samples \nbeyond the end of the study for use in future research will need a licence from the Human \nTissue Authority.  The other alternatives available to you are:  Before the end of this project \nyou may make a new project based application to the Committee to conduct research on the \nremaining samples; The tissue may be deposited in an existing licensed tissue bank\u2026;  If none \nof the above apply, the tissue must be destroyed in an approved manner.  (A235, non-CTIMP, \nnew tissue only, AFTER) \n                                     \nDISCUSSION \nOur study looking qualitatively at the content of letters written by Research Ethics Committees to \nresearchers seeking approval to use human tissue for research purposes indicates that the impact of \nthe HT Act 2004  has been primarily to provide clarity and increased certainty about legal and ethical \n9 \n \nissues. The numbers of letters raising concerns specifically about tissue were similar before and after \nthe Act, and there was no noticeable difference in RECs\u2019 general concerns about informed consent, \nincluding consent to take tissue. However, RECs seemed less inclined to raise concerns about \nconsent for the use of tissue in the After sample. There were also contrasts between the Before and \nAfter letters in RECs\u2019 approaches to raising concerns and giving advice. In the Before sample there \nwas evidence of a degree of uncertainty governing REC decisions about consent to use and store \ntissue; RECs drew on their own ethical standards, but were clearly looking to the future for more \ndefinitive guidance.  In contrast, the letters in the After sample drew on the authority of the Act, \ndemonstrating a more consistent approach, and providing more authoritative advice to researchers.  \n \nOur study design does not allow us to analyse the materials submitted to RECs. It is thus difficult to \ncomment on how far the absence of comments on particular issues reflects the REC's perception \nthat all was well with the application, or how far it might reflect a lack of attention by the REC to \nthese issues.   We might argue, however, that the changes we have observed are likely to be due to \nincreased clarity and certainty about what is allowed and what is needed to secure a favourable \nopinion from a REC. The HT Act and the Codes of Practice and other advice from the Human Tissue \nAuthority, as well as training provided by NRES, is likely to have provided enhanced clarity for \nresearchers as well as RECs.  The differences in the nature of concerns raised in the After sample \ncompared with the Before sample may at least partly be a result of researchers drawing on these \nsources of authority and being more likely to propose solutions to ethical troubles related to human \ntissue that are consistent with REC judgements.  It is also possible that researchers no longer choose \nto apply to conduct research which is likely to be viewed unfavourably by RECs. \n \nBy making research without consent legally permissible on approval by a REC, the HT Act may have \neased some of the tensions and conflicts for RECs between perceived responsibilities for ensuring \nappropriate informed consent, and desires to act as responsible stewards for research data, ensuring \nthat potentially valuable research is not obstructed when gaining consent would be impractical. The \nintroduction of the Act means that RECs no longer have to make judgements and decisions about \nthe need for consent by drawing on their own ethical principles, but can draw on legal guidelines \nwhich provide consistent and authoritative guidance.  \n \nIn conclusion, we found no evidence that, in the wake of the HT Act, RECs are more cautious about \napproving research to use or store tissue without consent.  Rather, it seems that the number of \nconcerns raised by RECs about informed consent to use or store tissue in the After sample has \nreduced, and there is increased transparency in REC decision-making and advice to researchers.  Our \ndata suggest that the HT Act has provided clarity and authority to RECs and may indeed facilitate the \nprocess of gaining ethical approval for tissue-based research.   \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe thank our colleagues Richard Ashcroft and Neil Sebire for their helpful comments. \nCOMPETING INTERESTS \nNone. \nFUNDING \nThis project was funded by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES).  NRES had no involvement in \nthe study design, in the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, in the writing of this paper, or \nin the decision to submit the paper for publication. \n \n \n10 \n \nTake home messages \n1. The Human Tissue Act has helped to clarify and make consistent certain issues that were \npreviously left to the discretion of the reviewing REC. \n2. Informed consent is the issue that trouble RECs the most when they are reviewing applications \nto take, use or store human tissue for research. \n3. RECs are concerned that patients should give explicit consent for the use of the tissue in future \nprojects.  \n4. RECs appear to be more comfortable to allow tissue to be accessed without consent since the HT \nAct became law.  \nReferences \n \n                                                          \n1 Human Tissue Act 2004, (2004).
