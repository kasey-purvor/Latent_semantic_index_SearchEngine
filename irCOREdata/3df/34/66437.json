In recent reports,1\u20133 we have shown that for\nCdTe\/CdS\/transparent conducting oxide \u0001TCO\u0002 solar cell\nstructures grown on glass substrates, there is evidence of Si,\nO, and Na diffusion into the CdTe absorber layer from the\nglass. This was demonstrated using quantitative secondary\nion mass spectrometry \u0001SIMS\u0002 depth profiling, either from\nthe CdTe surface down to the glass substrate, or from the\nTCO surface down to the CdTe layer after glass substrate\nremoval, where these species were also found in the CdS\nwindow layer. F and Br are often used, respectively, during\nthe growth of the TCO and\/or the CdS layer, and in the\nbromine-methanol chemical etching of the structures prior to\nthe back contact deposition, but again very few data are\navailable in the literature regarding their effect on the final\ndevice.\nIn this letter, we report on a study of CdTe\/CdS\/TCO\nsolar cell structures grown on sapphire substrates in order to\navoid any contamination coming from the constituents of a\nglass substrate. The samples were depth profiled using quan-\ntitative SIMS analysis to reveal the concentration and distri-\nbution of the most important impurity elements that have a\npotential doping effect on both layers of the CdTe\/CdS het-\nerojunction. The data were compared with our previous find-\nings from structures grown on glass substrates.1,2\nThe SIMS was done from the CdTe side of the struc-\ntures, and to avoid unnecessary contamination, the CdTe sur-\nfaces were not polished prior to SIMS profiling. The struc-\ntures were grown on c-plane oriented and polished sapphire\nsubstrates of 5N purity. A TCO film consisting of indium tin\noxide \u0001ITO\u0002:F followed by SnO2 was first deposited by reac-\ntive sputtering using respectively Ar+CHF3+O2 and Ar\n+O2 ambient. The deposition temperatures were\n450\u2013480 \u00b0C for ITO-F and 450 \u00b0C for SnO2. A CdS layer\nwas then deposited by sputtering at 200 \u00b0C in Ar+CHF3,\nand the CdTe layer was deposited by close space sublima-\ntion. The CSS growth of CdTe was performed in Ar ambient\nwith a pressure of 100 mbar, and at temperatures of 540 \u00b0C\nand 750 \u00b0C for the substrate and source, respectively. The\nCdTe\/CdS\/SnO2\/ ITO:F\/sapphire structures were further\nprocessed with CdCl2 heat treatment at around 400 \u00b0C in air,\nand chemically etched for 5 s in 10% bromine-methanol\nsolution.\nSIMS depth profiles of Si, In, Cl, Na, O, Sn, F, and Br\nwere recorded on a Cameca IMS 4f using oxygen and cesium\nprimary ion beams. Relative sensitivity factors \u0001RSFs\u0002 for\nthe CdTe layer were used to calibrate all the profiles re-\ncorded, and we will therefore limit our discussion of the\nquantitative SIMS data to the CdTe absorber layer of the\nsolar cell structures although the data presented also allows a\nqualitative description of the distribution of impurities in the\nCdS window layer. RSFs for F and Br were extrapolated\nfrom HgCdTe SIMS standard while for all the remaining\nspecies the RSFs were extracted from CdTe single crystal\nimplants.\nFigure 1 shows the quantitative SIMS depth profiles\nof Na, Cl, Si, and O recorded from\nCdTe\/CdS\/SnO2\/ ITO:F\/sapphire structures as-grown \u0001i.e.,\nunprocessed\u0002 and following processing by CdCl2 heat treat-\nment \u00010.5 h in air\u0002 and bromine-methanol chemical etching.\nNa exhibited background levels of 6\u00011013 and 4\n\u00011016 cm\u22123 in the CdTe layer for unprocessed and processed\nstructures, respectively. Na also had a clear declining profile\nin the as-grown sample versus the processed one. Similar\nbehavior was found in as-grown structures on glass sub-\nstrates as compared to processed structures, where the Na\nbackground concentrations were reported to be 1015 cm\u22123 in-\ncreasing to 1017 cm\u22123 after processing.1 Overall, the concen-\ntration of Na is lower in CdTe when a sapphire substrate is\nused compared to glass, and this, together with the diffusion-\nlike profile, confirm that some of the Na present in CdTe was\noriginating from the glass substrate during the CdTe growth.a\u0002Electronic mail: m.emziane@durham.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 87, 251913 \u00012005\u0002\n0003-6951\/2005\/87\u000225\u0001\/251913\/3\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics87, 251913-1\nDownloaded 21 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

O showed a con-\nstant background level in CdTe for the unprocessed as well\nas the processed samples, comparable overall to what was\nrecorded for O in structures grown on glass.1 With regard to\nthe effect of the CdCl2 treatment on the impurity profile\nwithin the structures, the concentration trends of Na, Si, and\nO, for unprocessed structures as compared to the processed\nones, were in good agreement with our previously reported\nSIMS data from structures grown on glass and also with our\ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \u0001ICPMS\u0002 data\nrecorded from the CdCl2 powder used for the treatment of\nthe structures.1,2 Cl had a flat profile in CdTe for both the\nunprocessed and processed samples, while its concentration\nin CdTe is about 100 times higher in the processed structures\nthan in the as-grown ones. This comparison also shows that,\nfollowing processing, a Cl depletion occurs in the region\nnear the CdTe surface as compared to before processing, and\nthis behavior was also noticed in the case of solar cell struc-\ntures deposited on glass, and could be due to the chemical\netching that follows the CdCl2 treatment. It can therefore be\nconcluded that, quantitatively as well as qualitatively, Cl has\na similar trend independent of the substrate used.\nThe quantitative SIMS depth profiles of Br, F, Sn, and In\nfor CdTe\/CdS\/SnO2\/ ITO:F structures as-grown on sap-\nphire substrates and following processing are shown in Fig.\n2. Br showed a constant concentration of 4\u00011016 cm\u22123 in\nCdTe layer for unetched structures whilst for the etched\nstructures the Br concentration in CdTe was at least ten times\nhigher away from the CdTe surface, and reaches about\n1018 cm\u22123 near the CdTe surface with a clear declining pro-\nfile. It is therefore clear that upon etching with bromine-\nmethanol solution, Br is introduced into the CdTe active\nlayer. This effect has not been investigated before despite the\nfact that Br behaves as a donor in CdTe and is extensively\nused, in solution with methanol, for the chemical etching of\nthe CdTe surface prior to the deposition of the back contact.\nF concentration was higher at the CdTe surface and in the\nfirst micron of the CdTe layer for both structures but more\nparticularly for the processed one, as can be seen from Fig. 2.\nThe rest of the profile was constant at 4\u00011015 cm\u22123 regard-\nless of the structure. This suggests that F tends to segregate\nat the CdTe surface, and this segregation appears to be en-\nhanced on processing. There is a peak of F in the CdS layer\nof the as-grown structure that results from the CHF3 used\nduring the CdS sputtering, and appears to anneal out during\nprocessing. Sn showed flat depth profiles in CdTe with a\nconcentration of about 1014 cm\u22123 regardless of the structure\n\u0001Fig. 2\u0002, indicating clearly that, like for the structures on\nglass,1 Sn concentration and distribution are not influenced\nby the processing. Furthermore, the constant concentration of\nSn also had the same value when In2O3:F was used as TCO\ninstead of ITO:F\/SnO2, showing therefore that the main\nsource of Sn in the CdTe is not the TCO. Depth profiles for\nIn \u0001Fig. 2\u0002 showed a concentration peak \u0001\u00055\u00011015 cm\u22123\u0002 in\nCdTe near the interface with CdS for the as-grown structure.\nThe processed structure had a concentration steadily increas-\ning from 5\u00011014 cm\u22123 near the CdTe\/CdS interface to 2\n\u00011015 cm\u22123 near the CdTe free surface. This shows that the\ndistribution of In within the CdTe layer is clearly affected by\nthe processing, and that some of the In detected in CdTe may\nwell be due to the CdCl2 treatment as an In level of about\nFIG. 1.

However, in the\nas-grown structures considered in this investigation, the con-\ncentrations found for Si, O, Br, and Cl are, as shown in the\nfigures, higher than 2\u00011016 cm\u22123. This finding emphasizes\nthe fact that even before undergoing any processing step, the\nstructures have already some Si, O, Br, and Cl coming from\nimpurity sources other than the CdTe starting material. Since\nthese structures were all grown on sapphire \u0001known for its\nstability at the temperatures used in this study\u0002 it is very\nunlikely that these impurity species are originating from the\nsapphire substrates. Therefore, the potential contamination\nsources are the growth chambers and environments used for\nthe sputtering and the CSS deposition of the structure layers,\ntogether with the diffusion into the CdTe layer of elements\nfrom the other layers of the structure.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that while Na\noriginates from the glass, it is also introduced by processing\nwith impure CdCl2. Si has a profile that is substrate indepen-\ndent and cannot be attributed to glass. As expected, Br is\nintroduced by bromine-methanol etching and was shown to\nbe a potentially important contaminant. F is introduced by\nCHF3 gas used during sputtering of ITO and CdS. Sn is not\nintroduced from SnO2 TCO, and SnO2 is a barrier to In dif-\nfusion from ITO into CdTe. In does however come from both\nthe TCO and from impurities in the CdCl2 used for process-\ning. The concentrations and profile shapes of O and Cl were\nnot found to depend upon the substrate used.\nThe solar cell devices fabricated using the process de-\nscribed in this letter are reported and discussed in more detail\nelsewhere.4 Using a similar device fabrication process,\nRomeo et al.5 showed recently that cell efficiencies of up to\n15.8% can be achieved, while a 14% efficiency was demon-\nstrated by Gupta et al.6 for all-sputtered solar cells.\nBy comparing devices grown on sapphire and glass sub-\nstrates using TCO layers of different nature, most of the is-\nsues discussed in this letter are relevant to a wide range of\ntechnologies that use TCO\/glass as a large area low-cost sub-\nstrate.\nThe authors are thankful to the EPSRC for financial sup-\nport under Grant No. GR\/R39283\/01.\n1M.
