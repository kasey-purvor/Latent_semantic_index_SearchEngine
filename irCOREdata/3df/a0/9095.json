Soc. 136: 1191\u20131204. DOI:10.1002\/qj.647\n1. Introduction\nClouds are a very important part of the Earth\u2019s radiation\nbudget, and the interaction of clouds with radiation has\nsignificant effects on climate. However, on account of the\ncomplex processes that determine a cloud\u2019s evolution, and\nthe complicated structure that exists within it, modelling\nclouds in a reasonable manner remains the greatest challenge\nin climate modelling (Randall, et al., 2007). Part of this\nchallenge is presented by the sensitivity of the radiation\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.\n1192 J. K. P. Shonk et al.\nbudget to cloud properties (e.g. Slingo, 1990). In turn, on\naccount of the inextricable connection between clouds and\nradiation, there is a large uncertainty in the magnitude and\nsign of the cloud feedback (Colman, 2003; Webb, et al.,\n2006). In order to make progress, it is imperative that we\nrepresent clouds as realistically as possible in climate models.\nBoth macroscale structure, such as vertical alignment of\nclouds in their gridboxes (Wu and Moncrieff, 2001), and\nmicroscale structure, such as variation of ice crystal size\n(Gu and Liou, 2006), can lead to significant biases being\nintroduced into the Earth\u2019s radiation budget. In terms of\nrepresenting cloud structure, the issue can be partitioned\ninto two parts: firstly, we need a reliable representation\nof horizontal cloud structure; and secondly, we require a\nrealistic parametrization describing how the cloud aligns\nvertically. Barker, et al. (1999) found poor representation\nof either component to generate large radiative biases when\nevaluated with a radiation code, with error contributions of\ndifferent signs from the two components.\nMost modern general circulation models (GCMs)\nrepresent clouds using the plane-parallel approximation:\na single homogeneous region of cloud in each gridbox layer.\nWhile the plane-parallel approximation is computationally\nefficient, removing cloud structure has detrimental effects\non the interaction between clouds and radiation, both in\nthe short-wave (e.g. Barker and Davies, 1992; Carlin, et al.,\n2002) and the long-wave (e.g. Pomroy and Illingworth,\n2000), creating positive biases in short-wave albedo and\nlong-wave emissivity of order 10% on average.\nSeveral solutions to the problem of plane-parallel biases\nhave been proposed. One suggestion was to scale the cloud\u2019s\noptical properties in order that its interaction with radiation\ncreates more realistic fluxes (Davis, et al., 1990; Cahalan,\net al., 1994; Cairns, et al., 2000). This method is efficient, but\na single value of scaling factor was found to be inappropriate\nfor all cases, as its optimum value is dependent on many\nfactors, including horizontal gridbox size (Pomroy and\nIllingworth, 2000) and spectral region (Yu, et al., 1997). It\nwas also found to have a range of different values across\nthe world, according to Oreopoulos and Cahalan (2005).\nAnother suggested approach involves statistically replicating\nthe inhomogeneity by weighting the cloud optical depth by\na distribution function. Barker (1996) modified the two-\nstream radiative transfer equations at a fundamental level\nto weight optical depth by a gamma distribution, which\nwas found by Carlin, et al. (2002) to dramatically reduce the\nplane-parallel biases. A gamma-weighting method proposed\nby Oreopoulos and Barker (1999) produced similar results,\nbut with increased computational efficiency by applying the\nweighting to the radiation transfer coefficients.\nA simple method to introduce inhomogeneity would be\nto use a multi-column independent column approximation\n(ICA) calculation. However, this has the major disadvantage\nof introducing significant additional computation time.\nThis can be reduced by temporal sampling, although the\nincrease in computation time could still be large. Pincus,\net al. (2003) recognised that this time increase was caused\nby the double integral over space and wavelength, and\nsuggested an ICA-type calculation that simultaneously\nsampled wavelength and cloud state, therefore creating a\ncalculation that required exactly the same time to perform\nas a plane-parallel calculation. This method, referred to\nas the Monte-Carlo Independent Column Approximation\n(McICA), has been implemented in the forecast system of\nthe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n(ECMWF; Morcrette, et al., 2008) and the ECHAM-5 model\n(Ra\u00a8isa\u00a8nen, et al., 2007).\nWhile the McICA method is computationally efficient,\nthe output fluxes suffer from an amount of random noise.\nThis is caused by the random nature of the allocation\nof spectral region to cloud state, and the randomness\nof the stochastic cloud generator used to generate the\ncloud states (Ra\u00a8isa\u00a8nen, et al., 2004). This noise was only\nfound to have an effect on climate simulations when\nthe level of noise was artificially high (Ra\u00a8isa\u00a8nen, et al.,\n2007). An alternative method was proposed by Shonk and\nHogan (2008). Known as \u2018Tripleclouds\u2019, the cloud scheme\nrepresents cloud inhomogeneity by introducing a second\ncloudy region into each layer of a gridbox. One of the two\ncloudy regions represents the optically thinner cloud in that\nlayer; the other represents the optically thicker cloud. The\nTripleclouds scheme does not suffer the effects of random\nnoise. However, on account of the added complexity of\nsolving radiative transfer through an extra region in each\nlayer, the calculation is found to take about 25% longer.\nWhen applied to radar data, Shonk and Hogan (2008)\nfound the Tripleclouds scheme to reduce an 8% plane-\nparallel albedo bias to less than 1%, with a much better\nperformance than applying a scaling factor. The scheme\nwas found to have no particular dependence on horizontal\ngridbox size, vertical resolution or solar zenith angle. It was\nalso found to reduce root-mean-square heating rate errors.\nIn terms of vertical structure, most current models tend to\nalign these plane-parallel clouds using \u2018maximum-random\u2019\noverlap (Geleyn and Hollingsworth, 1979). In this method,\nvertically continuous cloud is overlapped maximally, and\ncloud layers separated by at least one layer of clear sky are\noverlapped randomly. While the performance of maximum-\nrandom overlap was advocated by the study of Tian and\nCurry (1989), Barker, et al. (1999) found that overlapping\nvertically continuous clouds this way still caused biases to\nbe introduced. This implies that, for a pair of cloudy layers,\nthe cloud should be aligned such that its cloud cover is\nsomewhere between that of maximum-random and random\noverlap.\nHogan and Illingworth (2000) analysed cloud radar\ndata from Chilbolton in Hampshire, southern England, to\nderive cloud overlap statistics. They introduced an \u2018overlap\nparameter\u2019 \u03b1, which quantified the degree of correlation\nbetween horizontal cloud positions in two cloudy layers\nand had a value of zero for random overlap and a value\nof one for maximum overlap. They determined values of\n\u03b1 for pairs of cloudy model layers and found that, while\nrandom overlap described the overlap between cloud in\nseparated cloud layers, the value of \u03b1 had an exponential\nrelationship with the separation height that was less than\nmaximum, in agreement with Barker, et al. (1999). Using this\n\u2018exponential-random\u2019 overlap in a GCM should therefore\nimprove its ability to represent vertical cloud structure.\nIn this two-part paper, we aim to generate a full\nparametrization of cloud structure that is suitable for\nuse in a GCM, combining the Tripleclouds horizontal\ninhomogeneity parametrization of Shonk and Hogan\n(2008) with the exponential-random vertical overlap\nparametrization of Hogan and Illingworth (2000). Through\na review of a number of studies into both horizontal and\nvertical cloud structure, this paper (hereafter \u2018Part I\u2019) builds\nthe parametrization and modifies it to make it globally\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 136: 1191\u20131204 (2010)\nEffect of Improving Representation of Cloud Structure: Part I 1193\napplicable. The Tripleclouds method, described in full by\nShonk and Hogan (2008), was developed using radar data,\nand the statistics to describe the two water content values\nin each layer determined exactly from the predetermined\ndistribution function. We need to modify this method such\nthat the two values can be determined from the single value\nof water content available in the model data.\nSection 2 of this paper contains an in-depth review of\ncloud inhomogeneity, comparing statistics of variability of\nin-cloud water content and optical depth derived from a\nrange of data sources, both ground-based and space-based.\nFrom this review, a quantitative, globally applicable estimate\nof this variability is obtained. This is used to determine the\npair of water content values in the Tripleclouds scheme\nand is subsequently verified using radar data. Section 3 then\nreviews papers on vertical structure using data from ground-\nbased radar and derives a simple equation describing the\nglobal distribution of the nature of cloud overlap. This\nis then applied to exponential-random overlap and also\ntested on radar data. In the second part of this paper\n(Shonk and Hogan (2010), hereafter referred to as \u2018Part II\u2019),\nwe apply Tripleclouds and exponential-random overlap\nto global model re-analysis data from the ECMWF to\nevaluate the performance of the two components. We also\nseparately consider the effects on global radiation budget of\nimplementing the horizontal and vertical parametrizations.\n2. Horizontal inhomogeneity parametrization\nThe original Tripleclouds method used by Shonk and Hogan\n(2008) to calculate the pair of water content values in a given\ngridbox layer is demonstrated in Figure 1(a). The lower\nwater content value is determined by the 16th percentile of\nthe continous distribution in that layer, and the higher value\nis chosen to conserve the mean. This method (referred to\nhereafter as the \u2018lower percentile (LP) method\u2019), however,\nis only applicable when the water content distribution is\nknown, as was the case for the radar data used. For a GCM,\nwater content is stored only as a single mean value, with no\ninformation regarding the shape of the distribution. This\nimplies that an alternative method is required.\nThe studies discussed in the previous section all attempted\nto quantify cloud inhomogeneity using a range of different\nsets of observational data from a range of different platforms\n(satellite, radar and aircraft), for various locations and cloud\ntypes. In this section, results and statistics from some of these\nstudies are compared by converting their various measures\nof cloud variability into a single statistical quantity. We use\nfractional standard deviation, f . For a variable x, fractional\nstandard deviation is defined as the standard deviation of x\ndivided by its mean value:\nfx = \u03c3 x\nx\n. (1)\nIn section 2.1, previous measures of cloud variability are\nconverted to values of fractional standard deviation of either\nlayer-by-layer water content (fw), or vertically integrated\noptical depth (f\u03c4 ) or water path (fw). These studies are\nthen compared in section 2.2, with the aim of generating\na simple measure of horizontal cloud variability that is\nglobally applicable and can be used in the Tripleclouds\nparametrization. It will allow a pair of water content values,\nwTC, to be defined from a single mean water content value\n16th perc\nmean\nfre\nqu\nen\ncy\nwater content w\n(a)\nmean\nfw fwfre\nqu\nen\ncy\nwater content w\n(b)\nFigure 1. Schematic showing the calculation of the two water content\nvalues required for Tripleclouds using (a) the original lower percentile\n(LP) method of Shonk and Hogan (2008) and (b) the fractional standard\ndeviation (FSD) method used in this study. The shaded area represents the\narbitrary distribution of water content in a gridbox layer. In both methods,\nthis distribution is partitioned into two regions through the median, with\nthe two bars (pale grey and dark grey) representing the cloud water content\nin each region. For the LP method, the lower water content value is\ndetermined by the 16th percentile of the distribution, and the higher value\nis chosen to conserve the mean. In the FSD method, the exact shape of\nthe distribution (shown dashed) is unknown; the available information\nconsists only of the mean value, shown by the single bar at the mean water\ncontent. The pair of values are determined by adding and subtracting one\nfractional standard deviation to this mean value, shown by the pale grey\nand dark grey bars in (b). For mixed-phase clouds, this method is applied\nseparately to ice and liquid water content.\nw via the equation:\nwTC = w \u00b1 fww . (2)\nThis method, referred to as the \u2018fractional standard deviation\n(FSD) method\u2019, is shown diagrammatically in Figure 1(b).\nThe applicability of (2) is subsequently tested in a radiation\nscheme in section 2.3.\n2.1. Previous measures of cloud inhomogeneity\nThe scaling factor \u03c7 of Cahalan, et al. (1994) (and others) is\nrelated to both the mean and spread of the values of optical\ndepth in a gridbox, according to their Eq. (3.9), which gives\nthe definition of the scaling factor as:\n\u03c7 = exp{ln(\u03c4 )}\n\u03c4\n, (3)\nassuming that the effective radius of the water droplets is\nmuch less variable than optical depth. The derivation of\nfractional standard deviation from this scaling factor can be\nperformed simply by expressing the statistical properties of\noptical depth in terms of a two-point PDF, such as that used\nin Tripleclouds, with the two optical depth values separated\nby one standard deviation. For a discrete two-point PDF of\n\u03c4 with two values of optical depth, \u03c4 + \u03c3 \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c4 , (3)\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 136: 1191\u20131204 (2010)\n1194 J. K. P. Shonk et al.\ncan be written as:\n\u03c7\u03c4 = exp\n[\nln(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c4 ) + ln(\u03c4 + \u03c3 \u03c4 )\n2\n]\n. (4)\nWith further manipulation, this becomes:\nf\u03c4 = \u03c3 \u03c4\n\u03c4\n=\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03c72 . (5)\nUsing this equation, we can directly convert the values of\nscaling factor estimated from observations by Cahalan, et al.\n(1994) and Oreopoulos and Cahalan (2005) to values of f\u03c4 .\nThe definition of renormalisation parameter \u0005 used\nby Rossow, et al. (2002), based on the work of Cairns,\net al. (2000), does not allow straightforward conversion to\nfractional standard deviation. Rossow, et al. (2002) describe\nthe relationship between renormalisation parameter and\nscaling factor as:\n\u0005 = 1 \u2212 \u03c70 . (6)\nHowever, the scaling factor \u03c70 is defined differently to\nthe factor \u03c7 that was used by Cahalan, et al. (1994).\nThis difference is explained by Rossow, et al. (2002), and\ncomparisons are drawn between the two by Oreopulos and\nDavies (1998). Multiplying the linear mean optical depth \u03c4\nby the optimum value of scaling factor \u03c70 should give an\neffective mean value that is equal to the \u2018radiative mean\u2019\noptical depth; that is, the value of optical depth that gives\nthe true mean spherical albedo or emissivity. Performing the\nsame process with an optimum value of scaling factor \u03c7 will\nproduce an optical depth that is equal to the \u2018logarithmic\nmean\u2019 optical depth, as shown in (3). This will give correct\nradiative fluxes when using a log-normal distribution of\noptical depth, but may not give exact results when applied\nto real data. While these two definitions differ slightly, it\nis often fair to approximate distributions of water content\nto be log-normal (Hogan and Illingworth, 2003) and hence\nassume that \u03c7 \u2248 \u03c70. In other words, we can say:\n\u0005 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03c7 , (7)\nwith the condition that there is an element of uncertainty.\nConversion from \u03c7 to f\u03c4 can then be performed using (5).\nBarker, et al. (1996) described the cloud variability in their\nstudy in terms of the gamma distribution variance parameter\n\u03bd. This is simply calculated from the mean and standard\ndeviation of optical depth across each scene. Conversion\nfrom \u03bd to f\u03c4 is therefore equally straightforward:\nf\u03c4 = \u03bd\u22121\/2 . (8)\nPincus, et al. (1999) defined their cloud variability as\n\u2018dispersion\u2019, which is equivalent to fractional standard\ndeviation of the log of optical depth, fln(\u03c4 ). They also report\nthe mean of the log of optical depth, ln(\u03c4 ). From these\nquantities, we can extract the fractional standard deviation\nof optical depth using:\nf\u03c4 = fln(\u03c4 )ln(\u03c4 ) . (9)\nOur comparisons also include the cloud variability measured\nby Smith and DelGenio (2001). Their linear relationship\nbetween mean ice water content and its standard deviation\nled to a simple derivation of fw by evaluating the gradient\nof the best fit line. We also include calculations of fw for\novercast ice clouds using the empirical formula of Hogan\nand Illingworth (2003):\nlog10(f\n2\nw ) = 0.3 log10(\u0007x) \u2212 0.04s \u2212 0.93 , (10)\nwhere \u0007x is the gridbox size in kilometres and s is the\nvertical wind shear in m s\u22121km\u22121. This equation applies for\n\u0007x < 60 km; for any larger gridbox sizes, \u0007x is fixed to\n60 km. Our calculated values use a fixed vertical shear s of\n5 m s\u22121km\u22121 and gridbox sizes \u0007x of 50 km, 100 km and\n200 km. The statistics derived from the data used by Shonk\nand Hogan (2008) are also included in this comparison.\n2.2.

The gridbox size\nscale is logarithmic to account for the large gridbox size used\nby Cahalan, et al. (1994): 18 days of continuous radar data,\nwhich corresponds to a gridbox size of about 15 000 km.\nThe relationship between gridbox size \u0007x and fractional\nstandard deviation f derived for ice clouds by Hogan and\nIllingworth (2003) is shown as the solid grey line, for a wind\nshear of 5 m s\u22121 km\u22121. The attached horizontal error bars\nindicate the effect of varying shear from 2 to 8 m s\u22121km\u22121.\nThe case-to-case spread in f for their ice clouds, not shown\non the graph, is of comparable size in the negative direction,\nand slightly larger in the positive direction.\nTheory predicts that larger gridboxes should contain\ngreater amounts of inhomogeneity (e.g. the results of\nPomroy and Illingworth, 2000), and hence larger values\nof f , but any such dependence is masked by the large\ndifferences between the different methods. A dependence of\nthe fractional standard deviation values on the data source,\nhowever, is found. More specifically, clouds observed in\nterms of layer-by-layer water content (shown in Figure 2 as\nsymbols filled in white) have higher values of f on average\nthan those of clouds observed in terms of vertically integrated\noptical depth or water path (shown as symbols filled in grey);\nin other words, usually, fw > f\u03c4 . This difference is physically\nrealistic. Consider a cloud field that has layers of cloud, each\nwith identical water content statistics. If the inhomogeneities\nin each layer align perfectly, the optical depth values will be\nproportional to the water content values in the individual\nlayers, hence f\u03c4 will be exactly the same as fw. If the\ninhomogeneities in the layers do not align exactly, f\u03c4 must\nbe lower than fw, as regions of thicker cloud are now aligned\nwith regions of thinner cloud, reducing the occurrence of\nextreme values and effectively smoothing out the cloud.\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.

The white symbols indicate studies that investigated water content; the grey symbols indicate studies that\nconsidered water path or optical depth. The types of cloud used in the generation of each value are also shown.\nThe studies into variability in optical depth used gridboxes\nwith a variety of different cloud covers, and there is a range\nof f\u03c4 presented. The values found by Barker, et al. (1996) are\nat the extremes of those found in other studies, with a small\nvalue of 0.445 found for overcast stratocumulus, but a very\nhigh value of 1.374 for broken cumulus fields. This wide\nrange is most likely caused by the very small size of the pixels\nin the LandSat data they used: a pixel resolution of order\ntens of metres. In contrast to this, the studies of Pincus,\net al. (1999) and Oreopoulos and Cahalan (2005) used data\nwith a much larger pixel size of 1 km, while Rossow, et al.\n(2002) used ISCCP satellite data with a pixel size of 5 km.\nThese three studies show much less variability in their values\nof f\u03c4 . The higher measured f\u03c4 of the clouds observed by\nBarker, et al. (1996) could be caused by LandSat\u2019s ability to\nresolve the contribution to the total variance from smaller\nscales. In contrast, these small scales cannot be resolved by\nthe lower-resolution sensors used in the studies of Rossow,\net al. (2002) and Oreopoulos and Cahalan (2005), with the\nresult that cloud variability is smoothed out across these\nlarger pixels. There could also be a contribution from the\napproximation \u03c7 \u2248 \u03c70, although the size of the horizontal\nerror bars associated with this approximation indicate that\nthis effect is small.\nFor the studies into water content variability, there is\ngeneral agreement between the values derived by Smith\nand DelGenio (2001) and Shonk and Hogan (2008). The\nequation derived by Hogan and Illingworth (2003), however,\ngives lower values for all gridbox sizes, implying more\nhomogeneous clouds. This is probably due to the sampling\nof the data. The scenes evaluated by Shonk and Hogan (2008)\nconsist of a range of different cloud types with various\ncloud covers, often with whole clouds contained within\nthe gridboxes; those considered by Smith and DelGenio\n(2001) used horizontal aircraft flights that passed through\ncloud edges. Hogan and Illingworth (2003) derived their\nequation using only gridboxes that were entirely cloudy,\nhence the contributions to variability from cloud edges were\nnot accounted for, perhaps giving a measure of variability\nthat is not applicable to partially cloudy gridboxes. This effect\nis also seen in the results of Barker, et al. (1996): the fractional\nstandard deviation of scenes of overcast stratocumulus is\nfound to be of a similar value, and much smaller than the\ncorresponding value they found for broken stratocumulus.\nExamination of Figure 2 and Table I leads to the\nconclusion that fractional standard deviations of about 0.75\nfor water content and 0.65 for water path and optical\ndepth are representative of the variability of all clouds. A\ncalculation of these mean values of f , in which the results\nfrom each study are equally weighted and the spreads\nof the values in each study are accounted for, reveals\nvalues of fw = 0.75 \u00b1 0.18 and f\u03c4 = 0.66 \u00b1 0.20. As no\nnotable dependence of fractional standard deviation on any\nparticular category in Table I is discernible, we conclude\nthat these final values can be applied globally.\n2.3. Verification of fractional standard deviation\nThis approach to defining the water content values for\nTripleclouds is now applied to the 98 cloudy scenes of\nradar data used by Shonk and Hogan (2008). These scenes\nare derived from radar, lidar and microwave radiometer\nmeasurements made at Chilbolton, and are taken from\ntwelve days of radar data, with a wide variety of different\ncloud types and shapes present. The scenes are all single-\nphase: half consist purely of ice cloud, while half consist of\nlower-level liquid cloud. Each scene contains cloud with a\ndomain mean optical depth of no less than 0.01. We use\nthese data to determine whether the extra approximation\nof the FSD method has any detrimental effects on the\ncalculated radiation budget, and also to verify our chosen\nvalue of fw. For each layer of each scene, the Tripleclouds\nwater content values are derived from the mean value in that\nlayer using (2). To examine the dependence of the cloud\nradiative forcing (CRF) on fw, this calculation is performed\nusing values between 0.6 and 1.0. For each fw value, the\nEdwards\u2013Slingo radiation code (Edwards and Slingo, 1996)\nis used to calculate the radiative fluxes for each of the radar\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.

As in\nShonk and Hogan (2008), the short-wave CRFs have been inverted in sign\nto enable easier comparison between the two panels. All biases are with\nrespect to Tripleclouds calculations using the original \u2018LP\u2019 method, with a\nlower percentile of 16. The bar height shows the mean bias over the scenes\nfor each fw value, and the error bars show the spread in error bounded by\nthe 10th and 90th percentiles.\nscenes, and hence the CRF. These calculations using the\nFSD method are compared with a Tripleclouds calculation\nusing the LP method with the 16th percentile, described\nin full by Shonk and Hogan (2008), and chosen here as\nthe benchmark calculation. Biases are expressed in terms\nof top-of-atmosphere (TOA) CRF. As before, the sign of\nshort-wave CRF is inverted so that it is a positive quantity.\nAll calculations use maximum-random overlap. A list of the\ncloud representations used in this experiment is given in\nTable II.\nThe results of these calculations are shown in Figure 3.\nThe form of the plot is the same as the corresponding figures\nin Shonk and Hogan (2008): the size of each bar indicates\nthe mean value of the bias over the scenes, and the error\nbars denote the spread in errors for individual scenes in\nterms of the range spanned by the 10th and 90th percentiles.\nAs varying fw in the Tripleclouds scheme modulates the\ndegree of inhomogeneity represented, there is a dependence\nof the CRF biases on the choice of fw. Lower values of fw\ngive more homogeneous representations of cloud, hence\nthe biases tend to be more positive; higher fw values give\nlarger degrees of variability, and hence more negative biases.\nUsing a fractional standard deviation of 0.75 gives virtually\nidentical TOA CRFs to the TC(LP16) method.\nThe spread of the CRF biases with respect to the LP\nmethod does appear to be sizeable, although this turns out\nnot to be an issue. If the CRF biases in Figure 3 were to\nbe plotted with respect to ICA calculations, the spreads for\nthe LP and FSD methods turn out to be of comparable size\n(the FSD spread being slightly larger). The reason for the\napparently large spread of biases presented in Figure 3 is\nthat the correlation of biases between the two methods is\nweak: a larger bias using one method does not imply a larger\nbias using the other. The slight increase in spread between\nthe LP and FSD methods is inevitable and is most likely\ncaused by variability of the true width of the water content\ndistribution not being captured when using a single value of\nfw. This result verifies our choice of 0.75 for the fractional\nstandard deviation.\n3. Vertical overlap parametrization\nNow we consider vertical overlap and introduce a\nparametrization of vertical structure that is applicable for use\nalongside the Tripleclouds scheme, in an attempt to offset\nthe overcompensating biases. It has already been mentioned\nin section 1 that small changes in global cloud cover result\nin sizeable biases in the global radiation budget (Randall,\net al., 1984; Slingo, 1990). Such changes in global cloud\ncover can easily be introduced by inaccurate representation\nof vertical cloud overlap in a GCM. Both Barker, et al. (1999)\nand Wu and Liang (2005) used data from a cloud-resolving\nmodel (CRM) and calculated the radiative fluxes through\nthe clouds using a radiative transfer code. They both found\nbiases in TOA short-wave flux caused by using random\noverlap in place of exact overlap that were non-negligible\nin size with respect to plane-parallel biases. Despite the\ncomparable vertical resolutions of their generated clouds,\nthey found the size of the \u2018random overlap bias\u2019 to be\n0.88 (Barker, et al., 1999) and 0.16 (Wu and Liang, 2005)\ntimes that of the plane-parallel bias respectively. The smaller\nratio reported by Wu and Liang (2005) was due to the fact\nthat they used 30 days of CRM data in their analysis that\ncontained varying amounts of cloud structure, while Barker,\net al. (1999) used just three scenes that were intentionally\nhighly structured.\nIn this section, we develop and test a vertical overlap\nparametrization to complement the Tripleclouds scheme\nthat is essentially a modified version of maximum-random\noverlap. It allows overlap of layers of vertically continuous\ncloud to vary exponentially depending on the depth of\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. Q. J. R.

We derive\na simple global distribution of the decorrelation scale, and\ncompare the performance of this overlap scheme (referred to\nas \u2018exponential-random overlap\u2019) with maximum-random\noverlap.\n3.1. Parametrizations of vertical overlap\nOn account of the sensitivity of radiation budget to cloud\noverlap, it is important that an overlap parametrization is\nchosen for use with the Tripleclouds scheme that matches\nreal clouds most closely and hence enables them to interact\nmost realistically with atmospheric radiation. It has already\nbeen shown that the radiative impact of using an unrealistic\ncloud overlap approximation can be large. The principal\neffect of cloud overlap in terms of radiation is to vary\ntotal cloud cover in the scene, and changing cloud overlap\nbetween minimum, random and maximum has notable\neffects on radiation budget (Morcrette and Fouquart,\n1986). However, these overlap methods are too simplistic\nto realistically describe cloud arrangements. Geleyn and\nHollingsworth (1979) devised a cloud overlap method,\nknown as maximum-random overlap, which remains the\nmost widely used cloud overlap approximation in modern\nGCMs. Maximum-random overlap applies random overlap\nto cloud in layers separated by clear sky, but applies\nmaximum overlap to cloud in pairs of layers that are\nadjacent.\nThe performance of maximum-random overlap was\ncompared with that of maximum, random and minimum\noverlap schemes by Tian and Curry (1989), using a\ndataset derived from aircraft measurements, upper-air\nsoundings, surface and satellite observations. They found\nthat maximum overlap gave the best estimate of cloud cover\nfor vertically continuous cloud, with 81.7% of the snapshots\nin their dataset predicting cloud cover to within 2.5% of the\ntrue value, and a systematic overestimation of cloud cover\nusing both random and minimum overlap. For columns\nwith multiple discrete layers of cloud, random overlap was\nseen to give more realistic representations of cloud cover.\nHogan and Illingworth (2000) used radar data from\nChilbolton to derive cloud overlap statistics. They divided\ntwo-and-a-half months of data into gridbox-sized domains\nand calculated cloud cover for pairs of layers using\nmaximum, random and minimum overlap, then compared\nthe values with the true cloud cover of the cloud in these two\nlayers. In agreement with Tian and Curry (1989) they found\nthat, for pairs of cloud layers separated by at least one layer of\nclear sky, the clouds were overlapped randomly. However,\nfor pairs of layers in vertically continuous cloud, they found\nthat the degree of correlation between the cloud positions\ndecreased with vertical separation of the layers. Also, Barker,\net al. (1999) compared the effects of overlap on radiative\nfluxes using output from a CRM. They compared exact\noverlap with maximum-random and random overlap, using\nplane-parallel clouds and evaluating the exitant fluxes and\nheating rates through the clouds to diagnose performance.\nWith respect to exact overlap, the random overlap case was\nobserved to bias reflected short-wave flux and atmospheric\nabsorption high, and surface absorption low. At a solar\nzenith angle of 60\u25e6, they found outward short-wave flux\nto be (75.0 \u00b1 31.5) W m\u22122 too high across their three\nscenes when using random overlap. Implementation of\nmaximum overlap for adjacent layers biased these fluxes\nin the opposite direction, with short-wave flux biases of\n(\u221258.3 \u00b1 22.3) W m\u22122. These results imply that, for pairs\nof adjacent cloudy layers, maximum overlap results in a\ncombined cloud cover that is too small.\nHogan and Illingworth (2000) introduced an \u2018overlap\nparameter\u2019, \u03b1, as a measure of the degree of correlation\nbetween cloud positions in a pair of layers. By definition, the\ncloud cover of the cloud in the two layers when randomly\noverlapped, Arand, will always be greater than their cloud\ncover when maximally overlapped, Amax. They described\nthe true cloud cover of the two layers, A, in terms of these\nas:\nA = \u03b1Amax + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)Arand . (11)\nIn other words, \u03b1 = 1 implies maximum overlap, and \u03b1 = 0\nimplies random overlap. Hence, any cloud cover between\nthose of random and maximum overlap can be obtained in\na radiation scheme by setting \u03b1 to a value between zero and\none.\nHogan and Illingworth (2000) went on to plot variation\nof overlap parameter \u03b1 with layer vertical separation. For\nthe discontinuous cloud, they found the overlap parameter\nto be approximately zero for all separations. For continuous\ncloud, they found a near-exponential decrease of the overlap\nparameter with separation. They then described overlap\nparameter between such layers in terms of a decorrelation\nheight Z0\u03b1 according to the equation:\n\u03b1 = exp\n(\n\u2212 \u0007z\nZ0\u03b1\n)\n, (12)\nwhere the exact value of Z0\u03b1 is related to the vertical\nresolution and the horizontal domain size. The mathematical\nbasis of this result was considered by Astin and DiGirolamo\n(2006). They found the exponential decay of \u03b1 with height\nto apply when the distribution of cloud layer thickness was\nalso exponential.\nSince its initial suggestion, a number of other studies have\nmade use of overlap parameter \u03b1 (e.g. Bergman and Rasch,\n2002; Pincus, et al., 2005). Mace and Benson-Troth (2002)\napplied the algorithm of Hogan and Illingworth (2000) to\nradar data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement\n(ARM) programme, which has radars at several latitudes.\nThey found that the value of decorrelation height varied with\nlocation, and also with season at the midlatitude Great Plains\nsite. In the summer, an increase in upright convection here\nwas found to lead to more maximally overlapped clouds\nand larger decorrelation scales. Naud, et al. (2008) also\nused cloud radar data from ARM in combination with re-\nanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental\nPrediction (NCEP) to investigate the effect of changes in\nvertical motion, convective stability and wind shear on the\ndecorrelation height. Again using the method of Hogan and\nIllingworth (2000), they found vertically continuous clouds\nto be more maximally overlapped in the presence of vertical\nmotion in midlatitudes and decreased convective stability\nin the Tropics. These results are intuitive, as both these\nconditions result in clouds that increase in height more\nquickly, giving clouds that are nearer vertical. Increases in\nwind shear were found to increase the randomness of the\noverlap, with overlap becoming less than random for large\nseparations in some cases.\nIn other words, the optimum value of decorrelation\nheight across the world is likely to be strongly dependent\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright.

Using the information from the studies of\nHogan and Illingworth (2000) and Mace and Benson-Troth\n(2002), we are in a position to derive a simple relationship\nbetween decorrelation height and latitude. The values of\ndecorrelation height are plotted in Figure 4 as a function of\nabsolute latitude for each of the values reported in the two\npapers. The points indicate the mean value of decorrelation\nheight; the error bars show the spread at each location.\nOur plot includes a series of values for decorrelation\nheight derived as a function of absolute latitude from\nsatellite radar data from CloudSat and lidar data from\nCALIPSO (the grey dashed line). This series is calculated\nusing values of \u03b1 according to the calculations of Mace, et al.\n(2009), and appears to show a more maximally overlapped\nscenario than the values derived from surface radar sites.\nWe attribute this to a combination of two effects. Firstly,\nthe vertical resolution and gridbox size used to calculate \u03b1\nfrom the data are both larger, which will result in larger\ndecorrelation heights (Table I of Hogan and Illingworth,\n2000 and Table III later in this study). Secondly, the\ninclusion of rain in the analysis would artificially cause\nthe overlap to be more maximum. Barker (2008a) found\nthat inclusion of precipitation could cause an increase in\ndecorrelation height of order 500 m. (All of the surface radar\nstudies identified any rain regions using a lidar ceilometer\nand removed them from the data.) Barker (2008b) also\nobtained a continuous distribution of decorrelation height\nwith latitude from CloudSat and CALIPSO data. He found a\nmuch weaker relationship between the two, with a value not\nvarying much from 2 km, although his method of deriving\ndecorrelation height is different from the other studies.\nA simple linear fit is calculated that relates Z0\u03b1 in\nkilometres to the absolute latitude \u03c6 in degrees. On account\nof the inclusion of rain, the data from CloudSat is excluded.\nThe linear fit is found to be:\nZ0\u03b1 = 2.899 \u2212 0.02759\u03c6 . (13)\nA latitude-dependent decorrelation height has recently been\nimplemented into the ECMWF model, based on this result\n(Jean-Jacques Morcrette, personal communication). The\ndecorrelation lengths are calculated via a smoothed version\nof (13) and used in the implementation of McICA.\nWe recognise that this equation is crude in certain\nrespects: we have assumed a linear fit based on only five\npoints, and not taken into account any dependence of\ndecorrelation height on either the presence of convection or\nthe effects of wind shear. However, such a simple equation\nshould be sufficient to investigate the radiative effect of\nchanging overlap from maximum-random to something\nmore realistic. The values taken from the studies are\ncalculated as an average for each location, with error bars\nindicating the uncertainty in decorrelation height that could\npartially be due to neglecting these effects. The radiative\neffect of this uncertainty on the performance of exponential-\nrandom overlap is investigated in Part II.\n3.2. The beta overlap parameter\nIn this subsection, we describe how exponential-random\noverlap can be implemented simply into a radiation code.\nWe allow overlap between adjacent layers to vary between\nmaximum and random according to an overlap parameter\nlike that of Hogan and Illingworth (2000). However, while\ntheir \u03b1 succinctly describes overlap for a system with two\nregions in each layer, its definition becomes ambiguous\nwhen a third region is added. For this reason, we show\nhow an alternative definition of overlap parameter, \u03b2, can\nmake the implementation of exponential-random overlap\nfor multiple regions much easier. Overlap between a pair of\nadjacent layers is then determined via a decorrelation height\naccording to (13). It should also be noted that overlap is only\ncalculated between adjacent layers using the decorrelation\nheight, not at a distance as in Hogan and Illingworth (2000).\nTo describe how overlap with \u03b2 is implemented, we\nmust first re-introduce the concept of an overlap matrix.\nThis was introduced by Shonk and Hogan (2008), and is\na mathematical representation of the overlap of clouds in\nan arbitrary pair of layers. The two-region and three-region\noverlap matrices are given by:\nO =\n(\nAc,c Ac,l\nAl,c Al,l\n)\n, (14)\nO =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed Ac,c Ac,l Ac,hAl,c Al,l Al,h\nAh,c Ah,l Ah,h\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (15)\nwhere Ax,y denotes the fractional area of the domain with\nregion x in the upper layer and region y in the lower layer.\nAs in Shonk and Hogan (2008), the subscripts c, l and h are\nused to denote the clear-sky region, the cloudy region with\nlower water content and the cloudy region with higher water\ncontent respectively. For the two-region case, the single\ncloudy region is denoted by l.\n3.2.1. Beta with one cloudy region\nAs for the overlap parameter \u03b1 of Hogan and Illingworth\n(2000), our new overlap parameter \u03b2 has a value of zero for\na pair of layers that are overlapped randomly and a value of\none for a pair that are overlapped maximally, and can have\nany intermediate value. Consider a pair of adjacent layers\nin an idealised two-region cloud scene, with one region\nrepresenting the cloud and the other representing the clear\nsky, as shown in Figure 5. The pair of partially cloudy layers\nhas two different cloud fractions, which are denoted as L\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. Q. J. R. Meteorol.

A schematic showing the effects of the overlap parameter \u03b2 for a pair of cloudy layers with cloud fractions of 0.25 and 0.5 in the upper and\nlower layers respectively. Each panel shows the alignment of the clouds using a different value of \u03b2. The same value of \u03b2 is applied to both the clear-sky\nand cloudy regions. The top part of each panel shows the clouds viewed from the side; the bottom part shows the clouds viewed from above. See the text\nfor further explanation.\nand l, with L referring to the larger of the two values. The\ncorresponding clear-sky fractions are denoted as C and c,\nagain withC referring to the larger of the two values. Overlap\nparameter \u03b2 for a given region x defines the area of that\nregion that is overlapped maximally, mx,true, as a fraction of\nthe maximum possible maximally overlapped area, mx,max:\n\u03b2x =\nmx,true\nmx,max\n. (16)\nFirst, the maximally overlapped M matrix is calculated.\nIn the case of random overlap (Figure 5(a)), none of the\nregions are overlapped maximally and \u03b2 = 0; in the case of\nmaximum overlap (Figure 5(c)), similar regions in the two\nlayers are overlapped as much as is possible and \u03b2 = 1. In\nother words, the maximum overlap matrix is written as:\nM =\n(\n\u03b2c 0\n0 \u03b2 l\n)\n. (17)\nThe random overlap stage is then performed. Any remaining\nclear sky or cloud in either layer that has not been overlapped\nmaximally is overlapped assuming no correlation between\nthe cloud positions. One way of depicting this is to align the\nregions in the two layers orthogonally and view them from\nabove, as shown in the middle boxes on the bottom rows of\neach of the panels. This gives a random overlap matrix of:\nR =\n1\n(1\u2212 \u03b2c\u2212 \u03b2 l)\n(\n(C\u2212 \u03b2c)(c \u2212 \u03b2c) (C\u2212 \u03b2c)(L \u2212 \u03b2 l)\n(l \u2212 \u03b2 l)(c \u2212 \u03b2c) (l \u2212 \u03b2l)(L \u2212 \u03b2l)\n)\n.\n(18)\nThe total overlap matrix O is then found by summing these\ntwo matrices; in other words, O = M + R.\nIt can also be shown that, for a two-region system where\nthe \u03b2 values are the same for both the clear sky and the\ncloud, the two overlap parameters can be related to each\nother via an equation in terms of the difference in cloud\nfraction in the pair of layers, \u0007L = L \u2212 l:\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u0007L\n\u0007L + (1\/\u03b2 \u2212 1) , (19)\nwhich leads to the result that \u03b1 = \u03b2 for cases where \u0007L = 0\nand \u03b1 > \u03b2 for cases where \u0007L > 0.\n3.2.2. Beta with two cloudy regions\nWhen implementing a second cloudy region into each layer,\nsuch as in the Tripleclouds scheme, the advantages of using\n\u03b2 in place of \u03b1 to describe overlap become apparent. It\nis straightforward to extend the method described in the\nprevious subsection and Figure 5 to account for an extra\ncloudy region that is overlapped according to its own value\nof \u03b2. A key advantage of using \u03b2 for a three-region system\nis that its values may be different for the regions of clear sky\nand cloud. For a system with any number of regions, the\nvalues of \u03b2 for each region may be independently selected\nas any combination of numbers in the interval zero to one.\nThe values of \u03b1 for each region must be dependent on\none another. In a two-region system with cloud and clear\nsky, it is intuitive to set the two decorrelation heights to be\nthe same, implying that \u03b2c = \u03b2 l, hence Z0\u03b2c = Z0\u03b2l. For a\nTripleclouds representation, however, it is better to set the\ntwo \u2018in-cloud\u2019 overlap parameters, \u03b2 l and \u03b2h, equal to each\nother but to allow the \u2018cloud-boundary\u2019 overlap parameter\n\u03b2c to be a separate value.\nA typical ratio of cloud-boundary and in-cloud decor-\nrelation scales was found by Ra\u00a8isa\u00a8nen, et al. (2004). They\nused cloud fields derived from a GCM simulation that\napplied a CRM to each grid column, following the work\nof Khairoutdinov and Randall (2001). For their CRM data,\nthey determined the ratio of cloud-boundary to in-cloud\ndecorrelation height to be approximately equal to 2 for pairs\nof adjacent layers. It should be borne in mind that their defi-\nnition of in-cloud decorrelation length Lcw is different from\nour Z0\u03b2l: ours is determined using in-cloud overlap par-\nameter \u03b2 l; theirs uses rank correlation of the subgrid-scale\ndistribution of water content in the two layers. However,\nit can be shown that, if that distribution is a two-point\ndistribution function, as used in Tripleclouds, the overlap\nparameter and the rank correlation coefficient are identical\nin cases where either layer has a cloud fraction of 1; in\nwhich case, Z0\u03b2l = Lcw. Hogan and Illingworth (2003) also\nevaluated in-cloud decorrelation height in terms of corre-\nlation coefficient, and found it to take values of order 0.5\nto 1.0 km for domain sizes comparable to those used by\nHogan and Illingworth (2000). If a typical average wind\nspeed of 20 m s\u22121 is used to convert the temporal domain\nsizes of Hogan and Illingworth (2000) to physical sizes, the\nratio of cloud-boundary to in-cloud decorrelation heights\nturns out to be about 2.

Decorrelation heights in terms of alpha and beta\nThe fact that \u03b1 \u0005= \u03b2 in most cases implies that we cannot\nassume the height over which \u03b1 decorrelates, Z0\u03b1 , to be\nequal to the equivalent height for \u03b2, Z0\u03b2 . In other words,\nour global decorrelation height distribution (13) cannot\nbe applied to the clouds with Z0\u03b2 in place of Z0\u03b1 . In this\nsection, we address the issue of the difference between the\ntwo parameters by seeking a relationship between the two\ndecorrelation height scales, Z0\u03b1 and Z0\u03b2 . Throughout, we\nuse terminology that applies to a two-region system. Our\napproach is to investigate the ratio of the two decorrelation\nheights and identify whether there is a single value of this\nratio. We refer to the ratio as \u03b3 , and define it as:\n\u03b3 = Z0\u03b2\nZ0\u03b1\n. (20)\nFigure 6 shows \u03b3 as a function of overlap parameter \u03b2 for\na two-region system, calculated from (19) for several values\nof \u0007L. Only in three cases is it true that Z0\u03b1 = Z0\u03b2 : if \u03b2 = 0;\nif \u03b2 = 1; or if the cloud fraction is the same in both layers.\nWe now perform an experiment to determine a value for\n\u03b3 . Eighteen months of continuous data from the 94 GHz\nvertically pointing radar at Chilbolton are used, in the\nperiod from 01 April 2003 to 30 September 2004. The raw\ndata are stored at 60 m vertical resolution and 30 s temporal\nresolution. Each day of data is divided into a number of\nscenes of a given temporal length \u0007t, and averaged vertically\nto give a particular vertical resolution \u0007z. These resolutions\nare chosen to match those used by Hogan and Illingworth\n(2000). Periods with data missing or precipitation present are\nexcluded from the investigation. Precipitation is identified\nusing data from a lidar ceilometer, which locates cloud base\nand can hence determine whether precipitation is present\nTable III. Values of overlap ratio \u03b3 calculated from cloud\nradar data in the period from 01 April 2003 to 30 September\n2004, for different horizontal and vertical resolutions, \u0007t\nand \u0007z.\n\u0007t (min) \u0007z (m) Z0\u03b1 (km) Z0\u03b2 (km) \u03b3\n20 360 1.491 1.102 0.739\n720 1.857 1.448 0.780\n1080 2.239 1.797 0.802\n60 360 1.619 1.199 0.741\n720 1.934 1.505 0.778\n1080 2.241 1.803 0.805\n180 360 1.653 1.262 0.763\n720 2.157 1.672 0.775\n1080 2.493 1.947 0.781\nusing the same technique as Illingworth, et al. (2007). For\neach pair of adjacent layers in each scene, the cloud fractions\nin the upper and lower layer are stored, as well as the\ncombined cloud cover for that pair, A. A range of values of\nZ0\u03b1 and Z0\u03b2 are then applied to the cloud fractions, giving\n\u2018predicted\u2019 cloud covers A\u03b1 and A\u03b2 , also stored for each pair\nof layers in each scene. The optimal value of decorrelation\nheight is then determined as the value where the predicted\nmean cloud cover over all scenes and layer pairs equals\nthe true mean cloud cover over all scenes and layer pairs\n(A\u03b1 = A or A\u03b2 = A). Overlap ratio \u03b3 is then determined by\ndividing the two scales. It should be noted that the method\nused here to determine decorrelation height is different from\nthe methods used to derive the values of Z0\u03b1 presented in\nFigure 4. However, the aim of this subsection is to identify\nthe ratio of decorrelation heights, and we are using the\nsame method to determine both Z0\u03b1 and Z0\u03b2 . We make the\nassumption that the ratio we derive here from the \u2018effective\u2019\ndecorrelation heights will also be applicable to decorrelation\nheights calculated using a exponential least-squares fit (as\nHogan and Illingworth, 2000 and Mace and Benson-Troth,\n2002).\nThe overlap ratio is found to have a dependence on both\nvertical resolution and horizontal domain size, with a range\nof values as shown in Table III. We now select a value for\nuse with the Tripleclouds scheme. As it will be applied to a\nrange of data types, and as the conversion of the horizontal\ntemporal domain size to a physical size is so imprecise, we\nselect a typical value of 0.75. When applied to (13), this\nbecomes:\nZ0\u03b2 = 2.174 \u2212 0.0207\u03c6 . (21)\nWhen a second cloudy region is introduced, this equation\ngives the cloud-boundary decorrelation height Z0\u03b2c. The\nin-cloud decorrelation height Z0\u03b2l is set to half of this value,\nand applied to both cloud regions (Z0\u03b2l = Z0\u03b2h).\n3.4. Comparison of overlap methods\nAn experiment is now performed to compare the effects\nof overlap on the various cloud representations in terms\nof their interactions with atmospheric radiation. For this\nexperiment, we make use of the same 98 cloudy scenes used\nin section 2.3. Random overlap (\u03b2 = 0) and maximum-\nrandom overlap (\u03b2 = 1) are applied, along with five\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. Q. J. R. Meteorol.

The latitude\nat Chilbolton is 51.1\u25e6N, implying that Z0\u03b1 = 1.489 km,\naccording to (13). The exponential-random calculations\nvary \u03b3 from 0.55 to 0.95 in steps of 0.1, which has the\neffect of varying decorrelation height Z0\u03b2c from 0.82 km to\n1.42 km, using (20).\nTo independently investigate the effects of modifying the\nvertical overlap, we revert to using the lower percentile (LP)\nmethod for Tripleclouds described in Shonk and Hogan\n(2008), using the 16th percentile to determine the pairs\nof water content values. This removes all compensations\nto errors and spread introduced by the FSD method.\nFurthermore, we use Tripleclouds ICA calculations as our\nbenchmark. The Tripleclouds approximation is applied to\neach layer of the high-resolution radar data, which is then\nevaluated in a column-by-column approach, resulting in\nexact overlap. Shonk and Hogan (2008) showed that the\nICA was a very good approximation to a single-column\nintegration with Tripleclouds where overlap was conserved.\nThe short-wave and long-wave CRF biases are compared,\nwith the sign of the short-wave CRFs changed again for ease\nof comparison with the long-wave CRFs. A full list of the\ncloud representations used in this experiment, along with\nall of the abbreviations, is presented in Table IV.\nThe results of this experiment are presented in Figure 7.\nThe height of the bars corresponds to the mean bias over the\n98 cloudy scenes, and the error bars show the range spanned\nby the 10th and 90th percentiles of the distribution, hereafter\nreferred to as the \u2018spread\u2019. We see a more positive bias for\nrandom overlap and a more negative bias for maximum-\nrandom overlap, in agreement with Barker, et al. (2003)\nand Stephens, et al. (2004), among others. The smaller\nvalues of decorrelation height give biases nearer those of\nrandom overlap, while the higher values of Z0\u03b2c behave in a\nmore maximum-random manner. It is also seen that there\nis no significant increase in error spread when comparing\nexponential-random overlap with maximum-random.\nIn terms of both short-wave and long-wave CRF, a value of\n\u03b3 = 0.75 for the decorrelation height calculation produces\nsmall biases, although it is seen that the sensitivity of the\nCRF biases to \u03b3 is small. As before, there is a slight difference\nin biases for the two spectral regions, with a more positive\nbias in the long-wave than in the short-wave. In fact the\ndifference in bias over the range of \u03b3 values shown is smaller\nthan the slight positive bias observed in the long-wave CRF,\nsuggesting that the exact choice of \u03b3 is somewhat arbitrary\nwithin the range used here. However, attempting to obtain\nan optimum value of \u03b3 from these results is imperfect: while\nwe calculated \u03b3 from data at Chilbolton, the equation that\ndefines the decorrelation height was calculated as a fitted\nline to global data. In other words, the error introduced by\nvarying \u03b3 is smaller than the error introduced by uncertainty\nr e(0.82)e(0.97)e(1.12)e(1.27)e(1.42)\nTC(LP16)...\nm\n\u201320\n\u201315\n\u201310\n\u20135\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20(a)\nSW\n C\nRF\n p\ner\nce\nnt\nag\ne \nbi\nas\nr e(0.82)e(0.97)e(1.12)e(1.27)e(1.42)\nTC(LP16)...\nm\n\u201320\n\u201315\n\u201310\n\u20135\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20(b)\nLW\n C\nRF\n p\ner\nce\nnt\nag\ne \nbi\nas\nFigure 7.

Discussion and conclusions\nMisrepresentation of cloud structure is recognised as a\npotential cause of significant biases in radiation calculations.\nThese biases originate from two sources: use of horizontally\nhomogeneous, plane-parallel clouds; and use of vertical\noverlap schemes that assume clouds in adjacent model layers\nare maximally overlapped. This study aimed to combine the\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. Q. J. R. Meteorol.

The combination of the two parametrizations\ncould eliminate biases arising from poor horizontal and\nvertical cloud structure representation.\nThe initial investigations into Tripleclouds by Shonk and\nHogan (2008) calculated the two water content values for a\nlayer of a gridbox using the \u2018lower percentile method\u2019, where\nthe exact water content distribution for that layer was known\nand the lower value fixed to the 16th percentile. Here, we\ndefined an alternative \u2018fractional standard deviation\u2019 method\nthat does not require knowledge of an exact distribution, and\nuses a fixed fractional standard deviation of water content,\nfw. A review of a number of studies showed that there is no\nconsensus on how it varies with cloud type, gridbox size and\nso on. A globally representative value of this quantity was\nfound to be 0.75 \u00b1 0.18. Testing of the method on radar data\nusing the Edwards\u2013Slingo radiation code showed 0.75 to be\nthe most appropriate value for fw. Calculations using this\nvalue gave almost zero bias with respect to a calculation that\nuses the lower percentile method, but with a small increase\nin spread.\nA parametrization of vertical overlap was then developed\nfrom the results of Hogan and Illingworth (2000), that\ndescribes overlap in terms of the height-scale over which\noverlap parameter \u03b1 decorrelates, Z0\u03b1 . Using their results in\ncombination with those of Mace and Benson-Troth (2002),\na distribution ofZ0\u03b1 with latitude was determined that could\nbe applied to global model data. An alternative description\nof overlap parameter was introduced, referred to as \u03b2 , that\ncan more conveniently and intuitively describe overlap than\n\u03b1 in a three-region system. A relationship between Z0\u03b1 and\nits \u03b2 equivalent, Z0\u03b2 , was sought, again using radar data.\nAn average value of their ratio, referred to as \u03b3 , was found\nto be 0.75, enabling us to convert our Z0\u03b1 equation to Z0\u03b2 .\nThe overlap scheme, referred to as \u2018exponential-random\noverlap\u2019, was then compared with other overlap schemes\nusing the same sets of radar data and the same method.\nWith respect to exact overlap, both random and maximum-\nrandom overlap gave radiative biases of between 6% and 9%\nin both short-wave and long-wave cloud radiative forcing.\nBiases were reduced to much less than 1% in the short-\nwave, and just over 1% in the long-wave, with no significant\nincrease in spread.\nWe have shown here independently that the two\ncomponents of the full Tripleclouds scheme can drastically\nreduce the biases in cloud radiative forcing introduced\nby misrepresentation of cloud structure. The next stage\nis to perform radiative transfer calculations using global\nmodel data to evaluate the global effect of the horizontal\nand vertical components of the Tripleclouds scheme. This\nwill both investigate the performance of the Tripleclouds\nscheme with respect to the plane-parallel maximum-random\nrepresentation, and also consider the separate effects of the\nhorizontal and vertical components on global radiation\nbudget. Part II of this paper describes these experiments.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Keith Shine and Jean-Jacques Morcrette for their\nthoughts and input to this study.
