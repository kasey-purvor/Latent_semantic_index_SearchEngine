INTRODUCTION\nAmong the reactions that result in the removal of two\nlike nucleons from a nucleus are (a) light-ion induced two-\nnucleon transfer reactions, such as the (p, t) reaction, e.g.,\nRef. [1]; (b) the (e, e\u2032pp), electron-induced two-proton knock-\nout reaction, [2] and references therein; and more recently\n(c) two-proton decay of nuclei near the proton dripline, e.g.,\nRef. [3] and references therein. All of these manifest sensitivity\nto the pairing interaction between like nucleons. They also\nreveal sensitivity of the associated transition strengths to\nthe coherence of the two-nucleon configurations and to the\nmodel space used to describe the two-nucleon structures.\nVery recently, first measurements have also been made of\nthe two-nucleon knockout reaction from exotic secondary\nfragmentation beams by a light nuclear target. The reactions\nprobe the same two-nucleon transition densities that enter\ninto the other reaction descriptions, but (i) in distinct regions\nof the nuclear chart and (ii) with different spin and spatial\nsensitivity to the two-nucleon wave function. The reactions\nwe consider here involve the sudden, direct removal of pairs\nof like nucleons of a deficient nucleon species from some of\nthe most exotic nuclei.\nThe two-proton removal reaction, from an intermediate\nenergy beam of neutron-rich projectile nuclei, has recently\nbeen shown to proceed as a sudden direct reaction process\n[4,5]. Three new measurements, of two-neutron removal\n*Electronic address: j.tostevin@surrey.ac.uk\nreactions from the neutron-deficient sd-shell nuclei 26Si, 30S,\nand 34Ar, discussed theoretically in Ref. [5], were also recently\nreported [6]. These data, together with those of the two-proton\nremoval reaction from 28Mg [4], offer excellent test cases\nwith which to assess the two-nucleon knockout theory on\nsd-shell nuclei: cases where shell-model structure predictions\nare expected to be very reliable.\nThe description of the structure of the two-removed-\nnucleons, and also that of the assumed direct reaction\nmechanism, were treated only very approximately in Ref. [4].\nA more complete calculational scheme was subsequently\npresented in Ref. [5] and dealt with that part of the two-\nnucleon removal cross section that arises from the stripping\nreaction mechanism, also referred to as inelastic breakup.\nThat is, both of the removed nucleons were assumed to have\ninteracted inelastically with the target nucleus. Furthermore,\nthe theoretical approach of Ref. [5] showed how to combine\nfully the two-nucleon shell-model transition densities, and\ntheir associated spectroscopic amplitudes, with eikonal direct\nreaction theory. This analysis provided further evidence for the\ndirect nature of the reaction mechanism in such systems. That\nthere are significant differences between the spin selectivity of\nthe knockout reaction mechanism and that of the light-ion two-\nnucleon transfer reactions was also discussed in Ref. [5]. An\ninitial discussion of the sensitivity of the two-nucleon knockout\nreaction to the spatial correlations of the two nucleons can be\nfound in Ref. [7].\nIn the present article the earlier theoretical two-nucleon re-\nmoval (stripping) cross section calculations [5] are developed\nfurther to include a full calculation of contributions to the cross\n0556-2813\/2006\/74(6)\/064604(9) 064604-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nJ.

BROWN PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 064604 (2006)\nsection from events in which only one nucleon is absorbed\n(stripped) while a second is removed from the projectile by\nan elastic collision with the target (also called diffraction\ndissociation). Only an estimate of the (much smaller) cross\nsection due to the removal of both of the well-bound nucleons\nby the elastic dissociation mechanism is included. The theo-\nretical inclusive and partial cross predictions from the reaction\ntheory and shell-model transition densities are compared with\nthe relevant available data. Preliminary results of such model\ncalculations have been reported elsewhere, being applied to\ndirect two-proton knockout from 44S [8] and 54Ti [9] and\nheavy nuclei [10] and to two-neutron knockout from 26Si, 30S,\nand 34Ar in Ref. [6]. Full details of the required formalism\nand the methodology used are presented here. A preliminary\ndiscussion of the partial cross-section parallel momentum\ndistributions of the reaction residues to be expected following\ntwo nucleon removal is also discussed elsewhere [11].\nThe generalization of the formalism of Ref. [5] to include\nthe one-nucleon stripping plus one-nucleon diffraction events\nis presented in Sec. II. The inclusion of isospin dependence\nis discussed in Sec. II F. The methodology and partial cross-\nsection calculations for the nuclei 28Mg, 26Si, 30S, 34Ar, and\n54Ti are presented in Sec. III and the resulting cross sections\nare discussed in Sec. IV. Section V contains a short summary\nand concluding remarks.\nThe application of the present ideas and methodology\nto reactions involving the removal of two like-nucleons of\nthe excess species, such as for two-neutron removal from\nneutron-rich systems or of two-proton removal from nuclei\nnear the proton dripline, requires additional consideration of\ncontributions to the cross section from indirect (two-step)\nmechanisms.\nII. FORMALISM\nWe discuss two-nucleon knockout from a secondary pro-\njectile beam at intermediate energies of order 100 MeV per\nnucleon. We consider the projectile to be an antisymmetrized\nA + 2 nucleon system with many-body wave function\n\u0001(A, 1, 2). We do not enumerate explicitly all nucleon coordi-\nnates. Here, \u0001(A, 1, 2) is interpreted as the shell-model A + 2\nnucleon ground state of the projectiles. This is assumed to carry\ntotal angular momentum and isospin Ji and Ti with projections\nMi and \u03c4i . Following the sudden removal of two-nucleons in\na peripheral, high-speed collision with the target nucleus, the\nA-body residue (or core nucleus) is, in general, found in one of\na number of final states \u0003Jf Mf (A), with spin and isospin Jf , Tf\nand projections Mf , \u03c4f . The isospin and angular momentum\ncouplings involved are summarized in Fig. 1.\nA. Two-nucleon amplitudes\nThe two removed nucleons, denoted 1 and 2, are assumed\nto be removed from a set of one or more active (partially\noccupied) shell-model single-particle orbitals \u03c6j , having\nspherical quantum numbers n(\u0005s)j,m.

So as not to\ncomplicate the notation unduely, we do not show the isospin\nlabels and coupling explicitly. We discuss and include these\ninto the formalism in Sec. II F.\nB. Eikonal model and two-nucleon removal mechanisms\nIn the eikonal direct reaction theory, the interaction of the\ntwo nucleons (1,2) and the A-body residue f with the target\nare described by their elastic S matrices,Si , see, e.g., Ref. [12].\nThese Si are functions of their individual impact parameters\nbi and we assume they are spin independent. The two removed\nnucleons can interact either inelastically with the target, and be\nabsorbed from the elastic channel, reflected by an absorption\nprobability (1 \u2212 |Si |2), or interact elastically with the target,\ndescribed by |Si |2.\nThe total absorption cross section of the reaction is the\nprojectile ground-state expectation value\n\u03c3abs = 12Ji + 1\n\u2211\nMi\n\u222b\ndb\u3008\u0001JiMi |[ 1 \u2212 |SfS1S2|2 ]|\u0001JiMi \u3009,\n(3)\n064604-2\nDIFFRACTION DISSOCIATION CONTRIBUTIONS TO . . .

Expanding 1 = \u220fi{[1 \u2212|Si |2] + |Si |2}, and retaining only terms involving |Sf |2, the\nremaining contributions to the absorption cross section involve\nthe operators\nO = |Sf |2[(1 \u2212 |S1|2)(1 \u2212 |S2|2) + |S1|2(1 \u2212 |S2|2)\n+ |S2|2(1 \u2212 |S1|2)]. (4)\nThese terms reflect the underlying two-nucleon removal\nreaction mechanism in which the residue interacts at most\nelastically with the target and is measured in the final state.\nFor such processes we need consider, and have retained, only\nterms in the total absorption cross section that contain the core\ntransmission or survival factor, |Sf |2.\nIn Ref. [5], the stripping (inelastic breakup) contribution\nto the two-nucleon removal cross section was formulated and\nanalyzed. This cross section results from the (1 \u2212 |S1|2)(1 \u2212\n|S2|2) term above, i.e.,\n\u03c3str = 12Ji + 1\n\u2211\nMi\n\u222b\ndb\u3008\u0001JiMi ||Sf |2(1 \u2212 |S1|2)\n(1 \u2212 |S2|2)|\u0001JiMi \u3009. (5)\nThere are also contributions to the knockout cross section from\nthe remaining terms in Eq. (4), describing events where one\nof the two nucleons, say nucleon 1, is removed in an elastic\ncollision with the target and so emerges from the collision,\ndescribed by |S1|2, whereas the second nucleon, 2, is absorbed.\nThese contributions thus take the form\n\u03c31 = 12Ji + 1\n\u2211\nMi\n\u222b\ndb\u3008\u0001JiMi ||Sf |2|S1|2(1 \u2212 |S2|2)|\u0001JiMi \u3009.\n(6)\nWe make the simplifying approximation that the residue-\ntarget S matrix is diagonal with respect to different final\nstates f of the residue and that this diagonal interaction is\nthe same as that for the residue ground state (denoted Sc)\nfor all final states f . This has been termed the spectator-core\napproximation when used in single-nucleon knockout [13]. It\nassumes that amplitudes for dynamical excitation of the core\nduring the collision are small. We also neglect explicit recoil\neffects associated with the heavy, mass A residue. Thus, we\nreplace\n\u3008\u0003J \u2032f M \u2032f (A)||Sf |2|\u0003Jf Mf (A)\u3009 = |Sc(b)|2\u03b4ff \u2032\u03b4Jf J \u2032f \u03b4Mf M \u2032f , (7)\nwhere b is the projectile c.m. impact parameter.\nHaving made the spectator-core and the no-recoil approxi-\nmations, the inclusive stripping cross section is the sum of the\nincoherent contributions due to each residue final state.

Analogous expressions\nwill appear when we deal with the other operator forms arising\nfrom the stripping-diffraction removal mechanism.\nThese stripping-diffraction terms, \u03c3 (f )i , require further\nattention. It should be noted that the cross sections, as\npresently shown in Eq. (9), include all processes in which\nnucleon i survives the collision, including those in which it\nremains bound to the residue. These processes correspond\nto a single-nucleon absorption from the projectile, populating\nbound final states of an (A+1)-body residue. Such terms could\nbe ignored in an earlier discussion [15] of the nuclear breakup\nof Borromean nuclei, such as 11Li, where it can be assumed\nthat there are no A+1-body bound final states of the residue\n(core) and the (nonabsorbed) valence neutron.\nTo isolate the contributions that dissociate nucleon i from\nthe residue, we use closure and the complete set of states of\nthe nucleon-core system. So, we avoid explicit reference to\nthe continuum of nucleon-residue unbound states by rewriting\nEq.

Two-nucleon diffraction estimate\nFinally, in the following we include an estimate of the\n(smaller) cross section due to the removal of both (tightly\nbound) nucleons by elastic dissociation.

(20) through (30).\nThe two-nucleon amplitudes C are also T dependent. In\naddition, the final expressions for the cross sections must\nbe multiplied by the square of the isospin coupling Clebsh-\nGordan coefficient (T \u03c4Tf \u03c4f |Ti\u03c4i).\nIII.

We do\nso for the two-proton removal reactions from neutron-rich\n28Mg [4] and 54Ti [9], at 83.2 and 72 MeV per nucleon,\nrespectively, and for the two-neutron removal reactions from\nthe neutron-deficient sd-shell systems 26Si, 30S, and 34Ar, at\n109, 111, and 110 MeV per nucleon [6]. The ground-state-\nto-ground-state (g.s.) two-nucleon separation energies in all\ncases are large, because we remove nucleons of the deficient\nspecies from the well-bound Fermi surfaces. They are also\n064604-5\nJ. A. TOSTEVIN AND B. A.

Reaction and structure methodology\nThe reactions are analyzed within a consistent framework.\nIn all cases the two-nucleon amplitudes (TNA) CJiJf I\u03b1 are\ngiven by large-basis shell-model calculations, using the code\nOXBASH [16]. Our sd-shell test case systems, 28Mg, 26Si, 30S,\nand 34Ar, were calculated using the USD interaction [17] in\nthe full sd-shell model space. For 54Ti, with two protons in\nthe pf shell, we discuss only the 52Ca ground-state partial\ncross section, see also Ref. [9]. The TNA in this case were\nobtained using the GXPF1 Hamiltonian [18] within the full\nfp shell. The amplitudes in the case of 28Mg were already\nshown explicitly in Table II of Ref. [5]. A typographical error\nin one heading of that table should be noted [19].\nThe nucleon- and residue-target S-matrices S and the\nnucleon single-particle states \u03c6j were calculated as outlined in\nRef. [20] and are constrained by spherical Hartree-Fock (HF)\ncalculations. The point neutron and proton densities of the\nmass-A residues were taken from HF calculations based on the\nrecent Skyrme SkX parametrization [21]. This was determined\nfrom a large data set on spherical nuclei, including many\nnuclei far from stability. The resulting root-mean-squared\n(rms) matter radii were 3.009, 2.915, 3.049, 3.153, and\n3.632 fm for the 26Ne, 24Si, 28S, 32Ar, and 52Ca residues,\nrespectively. The Gaussian nucleon-nucleon (NN ) effective\ninteraction of Ref. [22] was assumed, with a range of 0.5 fm,\nand strength determined, in the usual way, by the free pp\nand np cross sections and the real-to-imaginary ratios of\nthe forward NN scattering amplitudes [23]. As in earlier\nanalyses [24], the density of the 9Be target was assumed to\nbe of Gaussian form with rms matter radius of 2.36 fm [25].\nThe nucleon bound-state radial functions uj\u0005(r) were calcu-\nlated in Woods-Saxon potential wells with a fixed diffuseness\nparameter of a = 0.7 fm. The radius parameters r0 of the\nbinding potentials were adjusted, for each (\u0005, j ) orbital, so\nthat their rms radius was consistent with the HF calculations.\nThis r0 adjustment was carried out at the separation energies\npredicted by the HF calculations. Having determined these r0,\nthe bound state wave functions for each transition of interest\nwere then calculated as eigenstates of the Woods-Saxon wells\nwith half the empirical two-nucleon separation energy. A\nThomas form spin-orbit potential of strength 6 MeV was\nalso included with the same (r0, a) geometry parameters. The\nsd-shell cases involved the 1d5\/2, 1d3\/2, and 2s1\/2 neutron and\nproton single-particle orbitals and the 54Ti(g.s.) case the proton\n1f7\/2, 1f5\/2, 2p3\/2, and 2p1\/2 states. All of these active orbitals\nwere included in the projection operator in Eqs. (15) and (17).\nThe phase convention of the uj\u0005(r) to be used with the TNA\nfrom OXBASH and its two-body interaction library is discussed\nin Ref. [5].\nIV. RESULTS FOR CROSS SECTIONS\nThe two-nucleon removal cross sections can now be com-\nputed. For each transition, the two-nucleon separation energy\nused was that of the ground-state transition plus the excitation\nenergy of the final state. To clarify the contributions from\nthe different stripping and diffractive removal mechanisms\nwe first show these separately. Although there is currently no\nmeasurement of these individual components, it will become\nclear that such a measurement would provide an excellent\nadditional test of these reaction mechanisms.\nIn Tables I and II we show the contributions to the\ntwo-nucleon knockout partial cross sections \u03c3 (f ) arising\nfrom the stripping, \u03c3 (f )str , the stripping-diffraction \u03c3\n(f )\nstr-diff(=\n\u03c3\n(f )\ndiff,1 + \u03c3 (f )diff,2) and the two-nucleon diffraction, \u03c3 (f )diff , reaction\nmechanisms. Table I is for the two-proton knockout reactions\nfrom 28Mg and 54Ti. Table II is for the two-neutron knockout\nreactions from 26Si, 30S, and 34Ar. The second excited state\nin 24Si is calculated assuming it is the second 2+ shell-model\nstate. The sum of all stripping and diffraction terms and the\nmeasured values are also shown, as are the inclusive cross\nsections to all bound final states in the cases of the 28Mg, 26Si,\n30S, and 34Ar projectiles. The excited states structure in the\ncase of the 54Ti \u219252Ca reaction is not well determined by\nthe shell model [9] and hence these excited state partial cross\nsections are not included here. Similarly, the recently measured\n44S \u219242Si two-proton knockout reaction [8], at the N = 28\nsubshell closure, poses a very interesting structural case, but\none that is not well suited to the present discussion of the\nTABLE I.

These single-nucleon suppres-\nsions are understood to be a consequence of the restricted\nmodel spaces used, even in large configuration-mixed shell-\nmodel calculations. These are unable to account quantita-\ntively for the redistribution of single-particle strength due to\nshort- and medium-range (tensor) nucleon-nucleon correla-\ntion effects and from longer-range correlations arising from\ncouplings, by nucleons near the Fermi surface, to collective\ndegrees of freedom. These phenomena are also expected to\nreduce the shell-model two-nucleon transition strengths. The\npresent work thus quantifies this reduction for mid-sd-shell\nsystems.\nThe ability to access removal reactions from weakly\nbound exotic nuclei, as is provided by the nuclear knockout\nmechanism, has also revealed evidence of a dependence of\nthe observed single-nucleon suppressions, Rs , on the nucleon\nseparation energy [20,24,28]. Any such separation energy\ndependence would not be revealed in the present work,\nwhere, as noted above, the two-nucleon separation energies\nare essentially equal for all of the systems studied. This is\nconsistent with the observed constancy of the deduced Rs (2N ).\nV. SUMMARY\nWe have considered reactions involving the sudden, direct\nremoval of pairs of like nucleons, of the deficient nucleon\nspecies, from exotic nuclei. We have formulated and discussed\nquantitatively the contributions to two-nucleon knockout\nreaction cross sections from events in which one nucleon\nis removed by the stripping mechanism and the second is\nremoved by the diffraction mechanism. The approach used\ncombines the eikonal reaction theory and microscopic shell-\nmodel transition densities. The additional contributions from\ntwo-nucleon diffraction events were also estimated. For the\nexamples considered, where each of the removed nucleons\nis bound by of order 15 MeV, this estimated two-nucleon\ndiffraction component is rather small, typically only 5%-8%\nof the total two-nucleon removal cross section.\nThe total additional cross section from all diffraction events\nis of approximately the same size as that from events in\nwhich both of the nucleons are stripped. The systematics\nof the measured partial cross sections are in general well\nreproduced, but the theoretical cross sections are now larger\nthan the measured values for 28Mg, 26Si, 30S, 34Ar, and\n54Ti projectiles: requiring a suppression of the shell-model\ntransition strengths. The latter were derived from full sd-\nand fp-shell configuration mixed calculations. For all of the\nsystems studied the deduced two-nucleon suppression factors\nRs(2N ) are consistent with a value of 0.5.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the United Kingdom Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under\ngrant EP\/D003628 and by the National Science Foundation\nunder grant PHY-0555366.\n[1] M.
