Patients from the Far East with reflux\ndisease had a lower prevalence of H pylori infection\nthan patients from western Europe and North\nAmerica, despite a higher prevalence in the general\npopulation.\nIntroduction\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a common condi-\ntion affecting 25-40% of the population.1 It is managed\nmainly in primary care and is associated with the larg-\nest prescribing cost in the NHS.2 Although there is\ngood evidence that infection with H pylori is the princi-\npal cause of peptic ulcer disease, there is uncertainty\nabout the organism\u2019s role in gastro-oesophageal reflux\ndisease. Treating H pylori infection is effective in\nhealing duodenal ulcers.3 The effect of eradication of\nthe organism in patients with gastro-oesophageal\nreflux disease is less clear, with some reports\nsuggesting that this might be counterproductive and\nthat H pylori infection might protect against the\ndisease.4 5 However, the recent Maastricht 2 guidelines\non the management of patients with H pylori infection\nrecommend eradication in those with gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease who are likely to require\nlong term proton pump inhibitor therapy.6 This is\nbecause profound acid suppression may accelerate the\nprogression of H pylori induced atrophic gastritis,\nincreasing the potential risk of cancer.\nThe evidence for an association between H pylori\nand gastro-oesophageal reflux disease remains mixed\nand largely uncertain. Studies evaluating the presence\nor absence of H pylori on gastro-oesophageal reflux\ndisease have often had drawbacks in design and have\ngiven conflicting results.7 8 Fundamentally it is not cer-\ntain whether there are differences in the prevalence of\nH pylori between patients with and without gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease.9\u201313\nWe conducted a systematic review to establish the\noverall prevalence of H pylori in patients with\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease and to determine if\nthis is significantly different from patients without the\ndisease. This is important for determining if patients\nwith the disease differ and to quantify the extent of\ninfection. This topic is also of relevance because of the\nlarge numbers of patients in the community taking\nlong term proton pump inhibitors, mostly for reflux.\nThe determination of H pylori status in these patients\nhas so far not been a clinical issue; gastro-oesophageal\nreflux disease is commonly diagnosed and treated in\nprimary care on the basis of a clinical history alone.\nMethods\nWe included studies to November 2001 fulfilling\ncertain eligibility criteria (box) by searching Medline,\nEmbase, Cinahl, and Cochrane, using subject terms\nand text words. Bibliographies of retrieved studies were\nreviewed, experts in six countries and pharmaceutical\ncompanies contacted (see bmj.com), and general\nmedical and major gastroenterology journals searched\nover the previous year.\nAssessment of eligibility and trial quality\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease was defined accord-\ning to published definitions.14\u201317 These comprised two\ncategories, both in patients who had heartburn or\nreflux as the predominant symptoms.

Disagreements were resolved by consensus\nwith a third reviewer. Quality assessments focused on\nwhether the methods for obtaining cases and controls,\ndata collection, and H pylori testing were stated.\nData extraction\nAR collated data from eligible studies on standardised\nforms, which were checked by SC. Data on the\nprevalence ofH pylori in various grades of oesophagitis\nand the absence of visible reflux disease on endoscopy\nwere recorded as reported, but for analysis the overall\nprevalence of H pylori in gastro-oesophageal reflux dis-\nease was used.\nData synthesis\nEach of the 20 included studies was summarised\naccording to its odds ratio, with an odds ratio of less\nthan one indicating a higher prevalence of H pylori\namong controls than among patients with gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease. Results were pooled with a\nfixed effect (Mantel-Haenszel) model, which was\nassessed with a test of homogeneity and a funnel plot.18\nOdds ratios were pooled with a random effects model\nin cases of substantial heterogeneity.19 The statistical\nanalysis was performed with the free package R, and\nthe rmeta subpackage contributed by Thomas Lumley\n(University of Washington).20\nResults\nOur initial search identified 654 articles, but only 45\nevaluated the prevalence of H pylori in patients with\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Thirty seven of\nthese met the eligibility criteria; 16 were excluded after\nfurther scrutiny (see table A on bmj.com),7 9 13 21\u201333 and\none was excluded because of overlap with a study by\nthe same lead author (the proportions between the two\nstudies were so close that there was virtually no differ-\nence in results; see table A on bmj.com).34 35 This left 20\nstudies for review, totalling 4134 patients, of whom\n58.5% (n=2418) were in control groups (table).10 35\u201353\nPrevalence of H pylori infection\nThe average prevalence of H pylori infection in patients\nwith gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was 38.2%\n(range 20.0-82.0%) compared with 49.5% (29.0-75.6%)\nin the comparator group. Four studies showed a higher\nprevalence of H pylori infection among patients with\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but not significantly\nso (fig 1 and table B on bmj.com).36 39 46 47 The remain-\ning studies showed a lower prevalence among patients\nwith gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, significantly so\nin six studies.10 35 42 45 49 53 The pooled odds ratio was\n0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.66), indicating\na lower prevalence of H pylori infection among patients\nwith gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (heterogeneity\ntest: \u00012=83.01, df=19, P < 0.001).\nWe found no clear evidence of publication bias (fig\n2): nor would any be expected in this context. Because\nof the presence of substantial heterogeneity, the studies\nwere pooled with the DerSimonian-Laird random\neffects model (summary odds ratio 0.60, 0.47 to 0.78),\nwhich showed weaker but still strong evidence of a\nlower prevalence of H pylori infection among patients\nwith gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\nStatistical heterogeneity was investigated by year of\nstudy (no effect) and by location. Five studies were of\npatients from the Far East,35 42 45 49 53 seven of patients\nfrom North America,37 38 40 48 50\u201352 and seven of patients\nfrom western Europe.10 40 42 44 45 47 48 One further study\noriginated from Chile.36 Some similarities were found\nin results for studies from particular geographical\nlocations (fig 1). When the three main groups were\nanalysed separately, the results for western Europe\ngave an odds ratio of 0.76 (0.61 to 0.96) and a test for\nheterogeneity of \u00012=14.01, df=6, P=0.030.

A single study from\nSouth America found a higher prevalence.36 Differ-\nences in location may explain much of the heterogen-\neity among the studies. Some of the remaining\nheterogeneity may be a product of clinical\nheterogeneity\u2014for example, differences in methods of\nH pylori testing, pH measurements, and endoscopic\nclassification of oesophagitis.54\nDiscussion\nOur systematic review found a significantly lower\nprevalence of H pylori infection among patients with\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease than among those\nwithout the disease, geographical location being an\nimportant determinant. Although the results we found\nwere based on studies with a comparator group, there\nwere significant differences between study design (pro-\nspective or retrospective case-control, trial), study\npopulation, identification of cases and controls,\ninclusion and exclusion criteria, matching of cases and\ncontrols, and methods of testing for H pylori. Our\nresults therefore need to be interpreted with caution.\nMost of the participants underwent endoscopy for\nclinical reasons and thus did not constitute a\npopulation group as such, although we discovered\nthree community based studies.41 42 44 Ascertaining the\nprevalence of H pylori thus depended on a proportion\nof patients who were being investigated for suspected\nlesions. This is unlikely to have substantially compro-\nmised our results because we excluded patients with\nsymptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who\nhad negative results for endoscopy or pH testing.\nGiven that there was substantial heterogeneity\nbetween the studies, we acknowledge issues about the\nappropriateness of reporting a pooled odds ratio. On\nfurther exploration we did find a possible difference\nbetween the Far East and North America or western\nEurope in prevalence of H pylori infection in patients\nwith gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; a single study\nChile, Csendes et al 199736\nWestern Europe\n   Newton et al 199746\n   Pieramico and Zanetti 200047\n   Gisbert et al 200139\n   Hackelsberger et al 199841\n   Manes et al 199944\n   Liston et al 199643\n   Werdmuller and Loffeld 199710\nNorth America\n   Vaezi et al 200050\n   El-Serag et al 199937\n   Goldblum et al 199840\n   Varanasi et al 199851\n   Vicari et al 199852\n   Schubert and Schnell 198948\n   Fallone et al 200038\nFar East\n   Shirota et al 199949\n   Wu et al 199953\n   Mihara et al 199645\n   Haruma et al 200042\n   Koike et al35\nSummary\nStudy Reference\n0.10 0.16 0.25 0.40 0.63 1.00\nOdds ratio\n1.58 2.51 3.98\nFig 1 Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for prevalence of H\npylori infection, grouped by geographical location.

Reasons are unclear\nand may be related to dietary or genetic factors. Four\nstudies reported a higher prevalence among patients\nwith gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but in only one\nwas the difference significant.36 Reasons are uncertain\nbut may partly be related to factors such as study\ndesign, selection of cases and controls, and method of\ntesting for H pylori. Again, presenting data as pooled\nestimates of odds ratios for geographical locations may\ngive the impression of post hoc confirmatory analyses,\nbut we strongly believe that there is a location effect\nevident in these data and that the prevalence has\ndifferent patterns within locations.\nWe did not separately analyse the prevalence of H\npylori infection in males and females. These data were\nnot obtainable in many studies and, when available,\nthere was no reported difference.We excluded patients\nwith Barrett\u2019s oesophagus because we thought that this\ncondition merited a systematic review in its own right.\nThe clinical relevance of a lower prevalence of H\npylori in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux\ndisease is unclear. Some studies have shown that H\npylori may be protective against gastro-oesophageal\nreflux disease and that infected patients may have a less\nsevere form of the disease.4 5 Evidence is also\nconflicting on the effect of H pylori infection on the\nefficacy of proton pump inhibitors. One study found\nthat patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease\nand H pylori infection responded significantly better to\nproton pump inhibitors than those without the\ninfection.8 Another trial found that patients not\ninfected with H pylori did not need higher doses of acid\nsuppression with proton pump inhibitors to stay in\nremission.7 Evidence shows that H pylori induces\natrophic gastritis in the presence of long term acid\nsuppression with proton pump inhibitors, and recent\nguidelines have advocated eradication of H pylori in\npatients receiving long term proton pump therapy.6 55\nWe are unable to definitively comment on the ben-\nefit or possible detriment of H pylori eradication in\npatients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; a\nfurther review of this is in preparation. Our findings\nadd insight into the complex relation between H pylori\ninfection and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\nClearly, more, well designed, prospective, large scale,\ncase-control studies and trials are required to\ndetermine the epidemiological relation between H\npylori and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and the\nclinical implications of this association.\nContributors: AR developed the protocol, reviewed the\nliterature, assessed eligibility of trials, checked eligibility\nassessments, performed data extraction, and cowrote the manu-\nscript.
