However, a multitude\nof different interconnection networks have been devised and developed in a continu-\ning search for improved performance, with many of these networks having hypercubes\nat their roots. Amongst these generalisations of hypercubes are k-ary n-cubes [14],\naugmented cubes [12], cube-connected cycles [26], twisted cubes [19], twisted n-cubes\n[18], crossed cubes [16], folded hypercubes [17], Mcubes [30], Mo\u00a8bius cubes [13], gen-\neralised twisted cubes [11], shuffle cubes [24], k-skip enhanced cubes [31], twisted\nhypercubes [22], supercubes [29], and Fibonacci cubes [20].\nPerhaps the most popular of these generalisations are the k-ary n-cubes [14]. A\nk-ary n-cube Qkn is essentially a \u2018k-bit version\u2019 of a \u20182-bit\u2019 hypercube in that vertices\nare represented by n-tuples of integers from {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} so that two vertices are\njoined by an edge if, and only if, their representations are identical save in one bit\nposition, where in that position the bits differ by 1 modulo k (thus, a k-ary 2-cube,\nfor example, is just a k \u00d7 k torus). It turns out that k-ary n-cubes have similar\nproperties to hypercubes yet provide more flexibility with regard to incorporating\n1\nmore processors; for the two parameters available, k and n, allow us to regulate\nthe degree of the nodes yet still incorporate large numbers of processors, although\nusually at a cost to some other property such as the diameter or the connectivity.\nSome properties of the k-ary n-cube are that it: has kn vertices and nkn edges; has\ndiameter n\u230ak2 \u230b; has wide-diameter n\u230a\nk\n2\u230b + 1, when n \u2265 3 or when n = 2 and k \u2265 6\n[21]; has connectivity 2n [10]; is a Cayley graph, and so is vertex-symmetric [7], and\nalso edge-symmetric [4]; and has an O(nk) time optimal routing algorithm [3, 15].\nA number of distributed memory multiprocessors have been built with a k-ary n-\ncube forming the underlying topology, such as the Mosaic [28], the iWARP [9], the\nJ-machine [25], the Cray T3D [23], the Cray T3E [2], and the IBM Blue Gene [1].\nAnother generalisation of hypercubes are augmented cubes, recently proposed\nby Choudum and Sunitha [12] as improvements over hypercubes. Hypercubes and\naugmented cubes (of the same dimensions) have the same sets of vertices. However,\nwhereas the recursive construction of an n-dimensional hypercube is to take two\ncopies of an (n\u2212 1)-dimensional hypercube and join corresponding pairs of vertices,\nthe recursive construction of an n-dimensional augmented cube AQn is to take two\ncopies of an (n\u22121)-dimensional augmented cube and as well as joining corresponding\npairs of vertices, pairs of vertices of Hamming distance n \u2212 1 are also joined (that\nis, vertices that are different in every component). Choudum and Sunitha show that\nan n-dimensional augmented cube AQn: has 2\nn vertices and n2n edges; has diameter\n\u2308n2 \u2309; has connectivity 2n\u2212 1; is a Cayley graph and so is vertex-symmetric; and has\nan O(n) time optimal routing algorithm.\nIn this paper, and inspired by [12], we extend a k-ary n-cube in a manner analogous\nto the extension of an n-dimensional hypercube to an n-dimensional augmented cube.\nOur definition of an augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k, in comparison with that in [12],\nis not a straightforward generalisation; however, we believe that it does reflect the\nessence of the extension in [12], and our structural results bear this out. We give two\ndifferent definitions of an augmented k-ary n-cube in Section 2 and show that they\nyield the same interconnection network. In Section 3, we show that an augmented\nk-ary n-cube AQn,k is vertex-symmetric and, furthermore, a Cayley graph, though\nnot edge-symmetric unless n = 2. In Section 4, we show that an augmented k-ary\nn-cube AQn,k has connectivity 4n\u22122, and that we can build a set of 4n\u22122 mutually\ndisjoint paths joining any two distinct vertices so that the path of maximal length\nhas length at most max{(n\u2212 1)k\u2212 (n\u2212 2), k+ 7}; that is, AQn,k has wide-diameter\nat most max{(n\u2212 1)k\u2212 (n\u2212 2), k+7}. In Section 5, we examine the diameter of the\naugmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k and show that the diameter of the augmented k-ary\n2-cube AQ2,k is \u230a\nk\n3\u230b+\u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309. We also show that the diameter of the augmented k-ary\nn-cube AQn,k is at most\nk\n4 (n+1), when n \u2265 3 and k is even, and at most\nk\n4 (n+1)+\nn\n4 ,\nwhen n \u2265 3 and k is odd. Our conclusions are presented in Section 6.\n2 Basic definitions\nWe assume throughout that arithmetic on tuple elements is modulo k, and we denote\ntuples of elements by bold type. Recall the definition of the k-ary n-cube Qkn: the\nvertex set V (Qkn) is {(an, an\u22121, . . . , a1) : 0 \u2264 ai \u2264 k \u2212 1}; and the edge set E(Q\nk\nn)\nis {(u,v) : u = (un, un\u22121, . . . , u1),v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1), either ui = vi \u2212 1 or ui =\n2\nvi + 1, for some i, and uj = vj , for all i 6= j}. Whilst we regard all graphs defined in\nthis paper as undirected, our definitions define all edges from the perspective of a given\nvertex. Thus, in our definition of Qkn we define the (undirected) edge (u,v) twice:\nonce from the perspective of u, as the edge (u,v); and once from the perspective of\nv, as the edge (v,u). The reason we do this is that later we shall define paths in\nour graphs and an undirected edge will be regarded differently depending upon the\ndirection it is being traversed in the path. The following definition adheres to this\nconvention.\nDefinition 1 Let n \u2265 1 and k \u2265 3 be integers. The augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k\nhas kn vertices, each labelled by an n-bit string (an, an\u22121, . . . , a1), with 0 \u2264 ai \u2264 k\u22121,\nfor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. There is an edge joining vertex u = (un, un\u22121, . . . , u1) to vertex\nv = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) if, and only if:\n\u2022 vi = ui \u2212 1 (resp. vi = ui + 1), for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and vj = uj , for all\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, j 6= i; call the edge (u,v) an (i,\u22121)-edge (resp. an (i,+1)-edge); or\n\u2022 for some 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n, vi = ui \u2212 1, vi\u22121 = ui\u22121 \u2212 1, . . . , v1 = u1 \u2212 1 (resp.\nvi = ui + 1, vi\u22121 = ui\u22121 + 1, . . . , v1 = u1 + 1), vj = uj, for all j > i; call the\nedge (u,v) a (\u2264 i,\u22121)-edge (resp. a (\u2264 i,+1)-edge).\nWe emphasise that the graph AQn,k is undirected but that edges are labelled differ-\nently, as an (i,+1)-edge or as an (i,\u22121)-edge, for example, according to the perceived\norientation.\nThe augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k can also be recursively defined as follows (the\nproof of this fact is a simple induction).\nDefinition 2 Fix k \u2265 3. The augmented k-ary 1-cube AQ1,k has vertex set {0, 1, . . . ,\nk \u2212 1} and there is an edge joining vertex u to vertex v if, and only if, v = u + 1 or\nv = u \u2212 1. Fix n \u2265 2. Take k copies of an augmented k-ary (n \u2212 1)-cube AQn\u22121,k\nand for the ith copy, add an extra number i as the nth bit of each vertex (all vertices\nhave the same nth bit if they are in the same augmented k-ary (n \u2212 1)-cube). Four\nmore edges are added for each vertex, namely the (n,\u22121)-edge, the (n,+1)-edge, the\n(\u2264 n,\u22121)-edge and the (\u2264 n,+1)-edge (as defined in Definition 1).\nWith respect to the above definition, we refer to the subgraph of AQn,k induced by\nthe vertices whose first component is i, for some fixed i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\u22121}, as AQin\u22121,k\n(this subgraph is clearly a copy of AQn\u22121,k).\nClearly, when n \u2265 2, AQn,k has k\nn vertices, (2n \u2212 1)kn edges, and every vertex\nhas degree 4n\u2212 2.\nWe adopt the following notation with regard to identifying specific vertices rel-\nevant to a given vertex in AQn,k. Let v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) be some vertex of\nAQn,k. For each i \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1} and each j \u2208 {1, 2 . . . , n}, we denote the ver-\ntex (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , vj+1, i, vj\u22121, . . . , v1) by v|\ni\nj . For j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, we refer to the\nneighbour (vn, . . . , vj+1, vj +1, vj\u22121, . . . , v1) (resp. (vn, . . . , vj+1, vj \u2212 1, vj\u22121, . . . , v1),\n(vn, . . . , vj+1, vj + 1, vj\u22121 + 1, . . . , v1 + 1), (vn, . . . , vj+1, vj \u2212 1, vj\u22121 \u2212 1, . . . , v1 \u2212 1))\nas v(j,+1) (resp. v(j,\u22121), v(\u2264j,+1), v(\u2264j,\u22121)). We can combine our notation as the\nfollowing example shows: v(j,+1)|\n3\nn denotes the vertex obtained by taking the vertex\n3\nv(j,+1) and fixing its nth component at 3 whilst leaving all other components as they\nwere.\nPaths in graphs are given as sequences of vertices (on occasion, a path might\nconsist of a solitary vertex). A path in AQn,k might be specified by the source vertex\nand a sequence of labels detailing the edges to be traversed, e.g., the path in AQ3,5\ndetailed as having the source vertex (0, 0, 0) and then following the edges labelled\n(\u2264 2,+1), (3,\u22121), (1,+1) is actually the path (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (4, 1, 1), (4, 1, 2).\nThe augmented 5-ary 2-cube is depicted in Fig. 1 (in two different ways): in the\nfirst drawing, the edges of the underlying 5-ary 2-cube (that is, the (2,+1)-edges,\nthe (2,\u22121)-edges, the (1,+1)-edges and the (1,\u22121)-edges) are drawn using narrow\npen and the \u201caugmented\u201d edges (that is, the (\u2264 2,+1)-edges and the (\u2264 2,\u22121)-\nedges) are drawn using broad pen; in the second, the (1,+1)-edges, the (1,\u22121)-edges,\nthe (\u2264 2,+1)-edges, and the (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges are drawn using narrow pen and the\n(2,+1)-edges and the (2,\u22121)-edges are drawn using broad pen.\nAQ 2,5\n(0,0)\n(1,0)\n(4,0)\n(3,0)\n(2,0)\n(4,4)(4,3)(4,2)(4,1)\nAQ 2,5\n(0,0)\n(1,1)\n(4,4)\n(3,3)\n(2,2)\n(4,3)(4,2)(4,1)(4,0)\n(0,4)(0,3)(0,2)(0,1)\n(1,0)\n(3,2)\n(2,1)\n(0,4)(0,3)(0,2)(0,1)\n(1,4)\n(3,4)\n(2,4)\nFigure 1. Two views of an augmented 5-ary 2-cube.\n3 Symmetry\nIn this section, we examine AQn,k as to any symmetric properties it might have. We\nbegin with a useful lemma which will be used to reduce case analyses in subsequent\nproofs, and the proof of which is trivial (especially given Fig. 1).\nLemma 3 (a) The following are automorphisms of AQn,k:\n(i) the mapping taking the vertex (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) to (vn \u2212 an, vn\u22121 \u2212 an\u22121,\n. . . , v1 \u2212 a1), where (an, an\u22121, . . . , a1) \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}\nn is fixed;\n(ii) the mapping taking the vertex (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) to (\u01ebvn, \u01ebvn\u22121, . . . , \u01ebv1),\nwhere \u01eb \u2208 {+1,\u22121} is fixed.\n(b) For i, j \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , k\u2212 1}, the mapping taking the vertex (i, vn\u22121, vn\u22122, . . . , v1)\nto (j, vn\u22121, vn\u22122, . . . , v1) is an isomorphism of AQ\ni\nn\u22121,k to AQ\nj\nn\u22121,k.\n(c) The mapping taking the vertex (i, j) to the vertex (j, i) is an automorphism of\nAQ2,k.\n4\n(d) The mapping taking the vertex (i, j) to the vertex (j \u2212 i, j), if i \u2264 j, and the\nvertex (i, j) to the vertex (k \u2212 (i\u2212 j), j), if i > j, is an automorphism.\nA graph is vertex-symmetric (also known as vertex-transitive) if it has an auto-\nmorphism mapping any given vertex to any other given vertex. The property of a\ngraph being vertex-symmetric is important when that graph is used as an interconnec-\ntion network for parallel computing, for having a vertex-symmetric interconnection\nnetwork makes parallel algorithm design and topological analysis easier, as well as\nallowing flexibility in, for example, linear array simulations.\nAn immediate corollary of Lemma 3 is the following.\nCorollary 4 The augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k is vertex-symmetric.\nProof Given vertices u = (un, un\u22121, . . . , u1) and v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) of AQn,k,\nby Lemma 3, the mapping taking an arbitrary vertex (wn, wn\u22121, . . . , w1) to (wn \u2212\n(un \u2212 vn), wn\u22121 \u2212 (un\u22121 \u2212 vn\u22121), . . . , w1 \u2212 (u1 \u2212 v1)) is an automorphism mapping u\nto v.\nHowever, we can do better. Let \u0393 be a finite group and let S \u2286 \u0393 be a set\nof generators of \u0393 not containing the identity and closed under inversion; that is,\ns\u22121 \u2208 S whenever s \u2208 S. The simple undirected graph G(\u0393, S) with vertex set \u0393 and\nwhere two vertices g and h are adjacent if, and only if, gh\u22121 \u2208 S, is called the Cayley\ngraph of \u0393 (with generating set S). Knowledge that an interconnection network is\na Cayley graph not only immediately yields that the graph is vertex-symmetric but\nalso provides an algebraic description of the graph that will be useful in, for example,\ndeveloping routing algorithms.\nLet (Zk)\nn denote the n-fold Cartesian product of the group (Zk,\u2295k), where Zk =\n{0, 1, . . . , k\u22121} and where \u2295k denotes addition modulo k. Let x = (xn, xn\u22121, . . . , x1)\n\u2208 (Zk)\nn; so x\u22121 = (k \u2212 xn, k \u2212 xn\u22121, . . . , k \u2212 x1).\nProposition 5 For every n \u2265 1, AQn,k \u223c= G((Zk)\nn, S), where S is the set\n{(0, . . . , 0, 0, k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), (0, . . . , 0, k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), . . . , (k \u2212 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1),\n(0, . . . , 0, 0, 1, 1), (0, . . . , 0, 1, 1, 1), . . . , (1, . . . , 1, 1),\n(k \u2212 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0), (0, k \u2212 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, k \u2212 1),\n(1, 0, 0, . . . , 0), (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, 1)}.\nProof By definition, V (AQn,k) = Zk \u00d7 Zk \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Zk (repeated n times). Let\nu = (un, un\u22121, . . . , u1) and v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) be vertices of AQn,k.\nSuppose that u and v are adjacent in AQn,k. So, for some i, one of the following\nholds:\n1. v = (un, un\u22121, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k 1, ui\u22121, . . . , u1)\n2. v = (un, un\u22121, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k 1, ui\u22121 \u2295k 1, . . . , u1 \u2295k 1)\n3. v = (un, un\u22121, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k (k \u2212 1), ui\u22121, . . . , u1)\n4. v = (un, un\u22121, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k (k \u2212 1), ui\u22121 \u2295k (k \u2212 1), . . . , u1 \u2295k (k \u2212 1))\nThus, we have (respectively):\n5\n1. u\u2295k v\n\u22121 = (un \u2295k (k \u2212 un\u22121), . . . , ui+1 \u2295k (k \u2212 ui+1), ui \u2295k (k \u2212 (ui + 1)),\nui+1 \u2295k (k \u2212 ui+1), . . . , u0 \u2295k (k \u2212 u0))\n= (0, . . . , 0, k \u2212 1, 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 S\n2. u\u2295k v\n\u22121 = (0, . . . , 0, k \u2212 1, . . . , k \u2212 1) \u2208 S\n3. u\u2295k v\n\u22121 = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) \u2208 S\n4. u\u2295k v\n\u22121 = (0, . . . , 0, 1, . . . , 1) \u2208 S.\nHence, u\u2295k v\n\u22121 \u2208 S.\nConversely, suppose that u\u2295k v\n\u22121 \u2208 S. So, u\u2295k v\n\u22121 is of the form (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0,\n. . . , 0) or (0, . . . , 0, 1, . . . , 1) or (0, . . . , 0, k \u2212 1, 0, . . . , 0) or (0, . . . , 0, k \u2212 1, . . . , k \u2212 1).\nHence, for some i, one of the following holds:\n1. u = (un, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k (k \u2212 1), ui\u22121, . . . , u1)\n2. v = (un, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k (k \u2212 1), ui\u22121 \u2295k (k \u2212 1), . . . , u1 \u2295k (k \u2212 1))\n3. v = (un, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k 1, ui\u22121, . . . , u1)\n4. v = (un, . . . , ui+1, ui \u2295k 1, ui\u22121 \u2295k 1, . . . , u1 \u2295k 1).\nSo u and v are adjacent in AQn,k.\nAs remarked earlier, (by definition) all Cayley graphs are vertex-symmetric and\nso we obtain an alternative proof of Corollary 4.\nWe end this section on symmetry by noting that although the augmented k-ary\nn-cube is vertex-symmetric (and, indeed, a Cayley graph), it is edge-symmetric only\nwhen n = 2 (recall that a graph is edge-symmetric if given any two edges (a, b) and\n(a\u2032, b\u2032), either there is an automorphism mapping a to a\u2032 and b to b\u2032 or there is an\nautomorphism mapping a to b\u2032 and b to a\u2032). Our key observation is that if a graph is\nedge-symmetric then the number of common neighbours of end-vertices of any edge\nmust be constant.\nSuppose that n \u2265 3 and k \u2265 3. Consider the edges ((0, 0, . . . , 0), (1, 0, . . . , 0)) and\n((0, 0, . . . , 0), (0, 1, . . . , 1)) of AQn,k. It is easy to see that (0, 0, . . . , 0) and (1, 0, . . . , 0)\nhave 2 common neighbours (namely (1, 1, . . . , 1) and (0, k\u22121, . . . , k\u22121)), if k \u2265 4, and\n3 common neighbours (namely (1, 1, . . . , 1), (0, 2, . . . , 2), and (2, 0, . . . , 0)), if k = 3,\nwhile (0, 0, . . . , 0) and (0, 1, . . . , 1) have 4 common neighbours (namely (1, 1, . . . , 1),\n(0, 0, 1, . . . , 1), (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), and (k\u22121, 0, . . . , 0), if k \u2265 4, and 5 common neighbours\n(namely (1, 1, . . . , 1), (0, 0, 1, . . . , 1), (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), (2, 0, . . . , 0), and (0, 2, . . . , 2)), if\nk = 3.\nSuppose that n = 2 and k \u2265 3. By Lemma 3, there are automorphisms fixing the\nvertex (0, 0) of AQ2,k and mapping the vertex (0, 1) to (0, k \u2212 1), (1, 0), (k \u2212 1, 0),\n(1, 1) and (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1). Thus, there is an automorphism of AQ2,k mapping any\nedge incident with (0, 0) to any other edge incident with (0, 0). As AQ2,k is vertex-\nsymmetric, this yields that AQ2,k is edge-symmetric. Thus, we obtain the following\nresult.\nProposition 6 Fix k \u2265 3. The augmented k-ary 2-cube AQ2,k is edge-symmetric,\nbut the k-ary n-cube AQn,k is not edge-symmetric when n \u2265 3.\n4 Connectivity\nIn this section, we examine the connectivity of AQn,k. The connectivity of a graph\nG = (V,E) is the minimum number of vertices (and their incident edges) needing\n6\nto be removed so that what remains is a disconnected graph. By Menger\u2019s Theorem\n(see, for example, [8]), a graph G = (V,E) has connectivity at least c if, and only if,\ngiven any two distinct vertices of V , there are c vertex-disjoint paths joining them.\nHaving a high connectivity is a desirable property of any interconnection network as\nit provides fault-tolerance with regard to message routing, allows for hot-spots to be\navoided, and allows large messages to be split up into smaller ones and routed in\nparallel along vertex-disjoint paths.\nThe connectivity of a graph G is denoted \u03ba(G). Henceforth, we write that two\npaths (which may have common start vertices or common end vertices) are disjoint\nto mean that they are vertex-disjoint. We show that \u03ba(AQn,k) = 4n \u2212 2, whenever\nn \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3. We begin by proving this result for AQ2,k and then for the general\ncase using a proof by induction (on n).\n4.1 The base case of our induction\nThe base case of our forthcoming induction is provided by the following result.\nLemma 7 The connectivity of AQ2,k is 6; that is, \u03ba(AQ2,k) = 6.\nProof We prove our result by constructing 6 disjoint paths joining any two distinct\nvertices of AQ2,k. By Lemma 3, w.l.o.g. we may suppose that our two given vertices\nof AQ2,k are u = (0, 0) and v = (i, j), where 0 \u2264 i < j. For the case when k = 3,\nLemma 3 tells us that we need only consider the cases when v is (1, 2) and (2, 2). The\n6 disjoint paths between (0, 0) and (1, 2) are as follows:\n1. (0, 0), (2, 2), (1, 2);\n2. (0, 0), (2, 0), (1, 2);\n3. (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 2);\n4. (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2);\n5. (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 2);\n6. (0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2).\nThe 6 disjoint paths between (0, 0) and (2, 2) are as follows:\n1. (0, 0), (2, 2);\n2. (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2);\n3. (0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 2);\n4. (0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2);\n5. (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2);\n6. (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2).\nFor k > 3, we have 2 different cases to consider. Recall, 0 \u2264 i < j.\nCase (i) 0 < i < j. Consider the following 6 paths:\n\u03b11: u, (k \u2212 1, 0), (k\u2212 2, 0), . . . , (k \u2212 j + i, 0), (k\u2212 j + i\u2212 1, k\u2212 1), (k\u2212 j + i\u2212 2, k\u2212\n2), . . . , (i+ 1, j + 1),v;\n\u03b12: u, (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), (k \u2212 2, k \u2212 2), . . . , (j, j), (j \u2212 1, j), (j \u2212 2, j), . . . , (i+ 1, j),v;\n\u03b13: u, (0, 1), (0, 2), . . . , (0, j \u2212 i), (1, j \u2212 i+ 1), (2, j \u2212 i+ 2), . . . , (i\u2212 1, j \u2212 1),v;\n\u03b14: u, (0, k \u2212 1), (0, k \u2212 2), . . . , (0, j + 1), (0, j), (1, j), (2, j), . . . , (i\u2212 1, j),v;\n7\n\u03b15: u, (1, 1), (2, 2), . . . , (i, i), (i, i+ 1), (i, i+ 2), . . . , (i, j \u2212 1),v;\n\u03b16: u, (1, 0), (2, 0), . . . , (i, 0), (i, k \u2212 1), (i, k \u2212 2), . . . , (i, j + 1),v.\nThese paths are clearly mutually disjoint.\nCase (ii) i = 0 and 1 \u2264 j. Consider the following 6 paths:\n\u03b11: u, (k \u2212 1, 0), (k \u2212 1, 1), . . . , (k \u2212 1, j \u2212 1),v;\n\u03b12: u, (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1), (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 2), . . . , (k \u2212 1, j),v;\n\u03b13: u, (0, 1), (0, 2), . . . , (0, j \u2212 1),v;\n\u03b14: u, (0, k \u2212 1), (0, k \u2212 2), . . . , (0, j + 1),v;\n\u03b15: u, (1, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (1, j),v;\n\u03b16: u, (1, 0), (1, k \u2212 1), (1, k \u2212 2), . . . , (1, j + 1),v.\nThese paths are clearly mutually disjoint. The result follows.\nFor any graph G and any two distinct vertices u and v of G, a c-container Cc(u, v),\nfor some c \u2265 1, is a collection of c vertex-disjoint paths joining u and v in G. The\nwidth of Cc(u, v) is c, the number of paths, and the length of Cc(u, v) is the length\nof the longest path. Suppose further that G has connectivity c. We say that the\nwide-diameter of G is at most d\u2032 if for every pair of distinct vertices u and v of G,\nthere is a container Cc(u, v) of width c and of length at most d\n\u2032. By examining each of\nthe different constructions in the proof of Lemma 7, we see that the maximal length\npath joining u = (0, 0) and v = (i, j) is k. Thus, we obtain the following result.\nCorollary 8 AQ2,k has wide-diameter at most k.\n4.2 The induction step\nWe now prove our general connectivity result.\nTheorem 9 \u03ba(AQn,k) = 4n \u2212 2, whenever k \u2265 3 and n \u2265 2, and given any two\ndistinct vertices of AQn,k, there are 4n\u2212 2 mutually disjoint paths joining these two\nvertices so that the length of the longest of these paths is at mostmax{(n\u22121)k\u2212(n\u2212\n2), k + 7}; that is, AQn,k has wide-diameter at most max{(n\u2212 1)k \u2212 (n\u2212 2), k + 7}.\nProof When n = 2 and k \u2265 3, the result holds by Lemma 7. We proceed by\ninduction on n. Our induction hypothesis is that any two distinct vertices of AQn\u22121,k\nare joined by a set of 4n\u2212 6 mutually disjoint paths (the base case of the induction\nis covered by Lemma 7).\nWe shall also calculate the length of a longest path as constructed according to this\nproof. Let dn(w,w\n\u2032) be the maximal length of any path as constructed according to\nthis proof joining any two vertices w and w\u2032 of AQn,k, and let \u03b4n = max{dn(w,w\n\u2032) :\nw and w\u2032 are distinct vertices of AQn,k}. We shall obtain a recursive estimate of \u03b4n.\nFix k, n \u2265 3. Given any two distinct vertices u and v of AQn,k, we shall construct\n4n \u2212 2 disjoint paths joining them. By Lemma 3, w.l.o.g. we may assume that\nu = (0, 0, . . . , 0) and v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1), with 0 \u2264 vn \u2264 \u230a\nk\n2\u230b.\n8\nCase 1: v = (vn, 0, 0, . . . , 0), where 1 \u2264 vn \u2264 \u230a\nk\n2 \u230b; so, v|\n0\nn = u.\nThe vertex u has 4n\u22126 neighbours in AQ0n\u22121,k. For each of these neighboursw, apart\nfrom (0, 1, 1, . . . , 1) and (0, k\u22121, k\u22121, . . . , k\u22121), build the path from w by traversing\n(n,+1)-edges until AQvnn\u22121,k is reached, before moving to v. This accounts for 4n\u2212 8\nmutually disjoint paths from u to v. From the neighbour (0, k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1, . . . , k \u2212 1),\nbuild the path by traversing (n,+1)-edges until AQvn\u22121n\u22121,k is reached, before moving to\nv. From the neighbour (0, 1, 1, . . . , 1), traverse (n,\u22121)-edges until AQvn+1n\u22121,k is reached,\nbefore moving to v. This accounts for another 2 paths from u to v that are mutually\ndisjoint and disjoint from all the other paths constructed above.\nFrom the neighbour (k \u2212 1, k \u2212 1, . . . , k \u2212 1) of u, traverse (n,\u22121)-edges until\nAQvnn\u22121,k is reached, before moving to v. From the neighbour (1, 1, . . . , 1) of u, traverse\n(n,+1)-edges until AQvnn\u22121,k is reached, before moving to v. Finally, two additional\npaths are obtained by traversing (n,+1)-edges from u until v is reached, and by\ntraversing (n,\u22121)-edges from u until v is reached. All paths constructed are mutually\ndisjoint and can be visualized as in Fig. 2. Note that the length of the longest\nconstructed path is max{vn + 2, k \u2212 vn + 1}; so, dn(u,v) \u2264 k.\nHaving dealt with Case 1, let us henceforth assume that v|0n 6= u. We now define\nsome paths which we shall use throughout the subsequent cases.\nOur induction hypothesis is that there are 4n \u2212 6 disjoint paths joining any two\ndistinct vertices of AQn\u22121,k. So, by our induction hypothesis, there is a set \u03a0 of\n4n \u2212 6 disjoint paths joining u and v|0n in AQ\n0\nn\u22121,k (by assumption u and v|\n0\nn are\ndistinct). Let us denote 4 of these paths as follows:\n\u2022 \u03c01 is the path passing through the neighbour u(\u2264n\u22121,\u22121) of u;\n\u2022 \u03c02 is the path passing through the neighbour u(\u2264n\u22121,+1) of u;\n\u2022 \u03c03 is the path passing through the neighbour v(\u2264n\u22121,\u22121)|\n0\nn of v|\n0\nn;\n\u2022 \u03c04 is the path passing through the neighbour v(\u2264n\u22121,+1)|\n0\nn of v|\n0\nn.\nNote that although \u03c01 and \u03c02 are always distinct, as are \u03c03 and \u03c04, it may be the\ncase that either \u03c01 or \u03c02 is identical to either \u03c03 or \u03c04 (note also that any one of the\nabove paths may consist of a solitary edge). We examine each of these circumstances\nseparately. Moreover, there are two distinct situations: when vn = 0; and when\nvn 6= 0.\nNote that every path \u03c0 in \u03a0, from u to v|0n, is such that there is a path \u03c0\ni in\nAQin\u22121,k, where i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , k\u22121}, from u|\ni\nn to v|\ni\nn obtained by taking the isomorphic\nimage of \u03c0 under the natural isomorphism (which takes (0, an\u22121, an\u22122, . . . , a1) to\n(i, an\u22121, an\u22122, . . . , a1); see Lemma 3). Throughout this proof, we extend this notation\nto arbitrary paths in AQ0n\u22121,k.\nConsider the situation when vn = 0 (and so v|\n0\nn = v). For each path \u03c0j , where\nj \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}, that is not the path u,v|0n, truncate \u03c0j at the penultimate vertex\n(that is, the vertex of the path that is a neighbour of v|0n) and also remove the first\nedge: denote this truncated path by \u03c1j (note that a path might be truncated so that\nit consists of a solitary vertex). Do likewise with all isomorphic images of \u03c01, \u03c02, \u03c03\nand \u03c04 (in AQ\n1\nn\u22121,k, AQ\n2\nn\u22121,k, and so on).\n9\nu(k-1,0,0,...,0)\n(1,0,0,...,0)\nAQ n-1,k\n0\nAQ n-1,k\n1\nAQ n-1,k\nk-1\nAQ n-1,k\nv  +1n\nAQ n-1,k\nn\nv  -1\nAQ n-1,k\nv  n\n v = (v  ,0,0,...,0)n\n(k-1,k-1,k-1,...,k-1)\n(0,k-1,k-1,...,k-1)\n(1,k-1,k-1,...,k-1) (0,1,1,...,1)\n(k-1,1,1,...,1)\n(1,1,1,...,1)\n\u03b1\n1 \u03b12\n\u03b1\n4\n\u03b1\n3\nFigure 2. The 4n\u2212 2 disjoint paths in Case 1.\nSuppose that \u03c11 6= \u03c13. If neither \u03c11 nor \u03c13 is the path u,v then we construct\nadditional paths u, \u03c1k\u221211 ,v|\nk\u22121\nn ,v and u,u|\nk\u22121\nn , \u03c1\nk\u22121\n3 ,v through AQ\nk\u22121\nn\u22121,k. If \u03c11 = u,v\nthen we have that v = (0, k\u22121, k\u22121, . . . , k\u22121). In this case, we construct additional\npaths u,u|k\u22121n , \u03c1\nk\u22121\n3 ,v and u,v|\nk\u22121\nn ,v through AQ\nk\u22121\nn\u22121,k.

We have that \u03c11 6= \u03c12.

The paths in Sub-case 4.3.\n19\nCase 4.4: v|0n = (0, 2, 2, . . . , 2).\nAs u and v|0n are adjacent, we must have that k = 3 and that v = (1, 2, 2, . . . , 2).\nBy Lemma 3, there exists an automorphism of AQn,k mapping (1, 2, 2, . . . , 2) to\n(2, 1, 1, . . . , 1) and fixing u. Thus, this sub-case reduces to Sub-case 4.2.\nAs regards the length of the longest path constructed, we have that \u03b4n \u2264 max{\u03b4n\u22121\n+k \u2212 1, k + 7} and \u03b42 = k. Thus, \u03b4n \u2264 (n \u2212 1)k \u2212 (n \u2212 2), unless: n = 3 and\nk = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; n = 4 and k = 3, 4; or n = 5 and k = 3, when \u03b4n \u2264 k + 7. The result\nfollows by induction.\n5 The diameter\nThe diameter of any graph G = (V,E) is the maximum of the set {dG(x, y) : (x, y) \u2208\nV \u00d7 V, dG(x, y) is the length of the shortest path joining x and y in G}. Obviously,\nthe smaller the diameter of an interconnection network, the lower the communication\nlatency (be this under store-and-forward or wormhole routing). In this section, we\nobtain the diameter of AQ2,k and an upper bound on the diameter of AQn,k when\nn \u2265 3.\nWe begin with some immediate observations as regards the order of edges in\npaths in AQn,k. Consider some path \u03c1 from some vertex u of AQn,k to some\nvertex v of AQn,k within which there is an \u03bb-edge, where \u03bb \u2208 {(i,+1), (i,\u22121), (\u2264\ni,+1), (\u2264 i,\u22121)}, for some i, as the ath edge of the path, and a \u00b5-edge, where\n\u00b5 \u2208 {(j,+1), (j,\u22121), (\u2264 j,+1), (\u2264 j,\u22121)}, for some j, as the bth edge of the path,\nwhere a 6= b. The path obtained from \u03c1 by traversing a \u00b5-edge as the ath edge of the\npath and a \u03bb-edge as the bth edge of the path, and leaving the labels of all other edges\nas they were, is still a path from u to v. Also, if \u03c1 is a shortest path between u and\nv and there is a (i,+1)-edge (resp. (i,\u22121)-edge, (\u2264 i,+1)-edge, (\u2264 i,\u22121)-edge) in \u03c1,\nfor some particular i, then there is no (i,\u22121)-edge (resp. (i,+1)-edge, (\u2264 i,\u22121)-edge,\n(\u2264 i,+1)-edge) in \u03c1. We use these observations throughout the proof of the following\nresult.\nProposition 10 The diameter of AQ2,k is \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309, and for n \u2265 3 the diameter\nof AQn,k is at most\nk\n4 (n+ 1), if k is even, and at most\nk\n4 (n+ 1) +\nn\n4 , if k is odd.\nProof By Corollary 4, we may restrict our attention to the lengths of paths from an\narbitrary vertex of AQn,k to the vertex 0 of AQn,k when determining the diameter\nof AQn,k.\nLet v = (v2, v1) be a vertex of AQ2,k.\nCase (i): k \u2261 0 (mod 3).\nSub-case (a): v1, v2 6\u2208 {\nk\n3 + 1,\nk\n3 + 2, . . . ,\n2k\n3 \u2212 1}.\nBy traversing edges with labels from {(i,+1), (i,\u22121) : i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, we can obtain\na path of length at most 2k3 from v to 0.\nSub-case (b): exactly one of v1 and v2 is in {\nk\n3 + 1,\nk\n3 + 2, . . . ,\n2k\n3 \u2212 1}.\nSuppose that v1 \u2208 {\nk\n3 + 1,\nk\n3 + 2, . . . ,\n2k\n3 \u2212 1}. By traversing (1,+1)-edges or (1,\u22121)-\nedges, we can move from v to (v2, v2), and by traversing (\u2264 2,+1)-edges or (\u2264 2,\u22121)-\nedges we can then move to 0. This yields a path of length at most 2k3 \u22121 from v to 0.\n20\nIf v2 \u2208 {\nk\n3 +1,\nk\n3 +2, . . . ,\n2k\n3 \u22121} then we proceed similarly except that we first traverse\n(2,+1)-edges or (2,\u22121)-edges to get to (v1, v1), before traversing (\u2264 2,+1)-edges or\n(\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges to get to 0.\nSub-case (c): v1, v2 \u2208 {\nk\n3 + 1,\nk\n3 + 2, . . . ,\n2k\n3 \u2212 1}.\nProceeding similarly to as in Sub-case (b) results in a path from v to u of length at\nmost 2k3 \u2212 1.\nIn consequence, when k \u2261 0 there is a path from v to 0 of length at most 2k3 =\n\u230ak3\u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309.\nCase (ii): k \u2261 1 (mod 3).\nWe proceed similarly to as in Case (i) except that we consider the values of v1 and v2\nas to whether they lie in {\u230ak3 \u230b+1, \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+2, . . . , \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\n3 \u2309\u22121}. We thus obtain a path\nfrom v to 0 of length at most \u230ak3 \u230b + \u2308\nk\n3 \u2309 \u2212 1. In consequence, when k \u2261 1 (mod 3)\nthere is a path from v to 0 of length at most \u230ak3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\n3 \u2309 \u2212 1 = \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309.\nCase (iii): k \u2261 2 (mod 3).\nWe proceed similarly to as in Case (i) except that we consider the values of v1 and\nv2 as to whether they lie in {\u2308\nk\n3 \u2309+ 1, \u2308\nk\n3\u2309+ 2, . . . , 2\u2308\nk\n3 \u2309 \u2212 1}. We thus obtain a path\nfrom v to 0 of length at most \u230ak3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\n3\u2309. In consequence, when k \u2261 2 there is a path\nfrom v to 0 of length at most \u230ak3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\n3 \u2309 = \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309.\nWhilst \u230ak3\u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309 is an upper bound on the diameter of AQ2,k, it is also a lower\nbound as we now show. Suppose that k \u2261 0 (mod 3) and the length of a shortest path\n\u03c1 from (k3 ,\n2k\n3 ) to (0, 0) is less than \u230a\nk\n3\u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309 =\n2k\n3 . If the edges of \u03c1 are all (i,+1)-\nedges or (i,\u22121)-edges then we immediately obtain a contradiction. Thus, there must\nbe some (\u2264 2,+1)-edges or (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges in \u03c1. By symmetry, we may suppose that\nthere are (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges (and so, as \u03c1 is a shortest path, there must be no (\u2264 2,+1)-\nedges in \u03c1). Moreover, we may clearly assume that all these (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges appear\nas a prefix of \u03c1.\nSuppose that there are at most 2k3 \u2212 \u2308\nk\n2\u2309 (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges in \u03c1 and that traversing\nthese (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges takes us to (v\u20322, v\n\u2032\n1). For an arbitrary vertex (v2, v1) of AQ2,k,\ndefine wt(v2, v1) = min{v2, k \u2212 v2} + min{v1, k \u2212 v1}, i.e., the distance of (v2, v1)\nfrom (0, 0) in the k-ary 2-cube Qk2 . As wt(\nk\n3 ,\n2k\n3 ) = wt(v\n\u2032\n2, v\n\u2032\n1) =\n2k\n3 , this yields a\ncontradiction (as any path from (v\u20322, v\n\u2032\n1) to (0, 0) traversing only edges with labels\nfrom {(1,+1), (1,\u22121), (2,+1), (2,\u22121)} has length at least wt(v\u20322, v\n\u2032\n1)). Thus there\nmust be between 2k3 \u2212 \u2308\nk\n2 \u2309+ 1 and\nk\n3 (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges in \u03c1 (clearly there cannot exist\nmore than k3 such edges as otherwise we could obtain a shorter path than \u03c1).\nSuppose that there existm+ 2k3 \u2212\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309 (\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges in \u03c1, where 1 \u2264 m \u2264 \u2308\nk\n2 \u2309\u2212\nk\n3 ,\nand that traversing these edges takes us to the vertex (v\u20322, v\n\u2032\n1). Then wt(v\n\u2032\n2, v\n\u2032\n1) =\n2k\n3 \u2212 2(m \u2212 1) \u2212 1. Any path from (v\n\u2032\n2, v\n\u2032\n1) to (0, 0) not using (\u2264 2,+1)-edges nor\n(\u2264 2,\u22121)-edges has length at least 2k3 \u22122(m\u22121)\u22121. Thus, the length of \u03c1 is at least\n(2k3 \u22122(m\u22121)\u22121)+(m+\n2k\n3 \u2212\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309) =\n4k\n3 \u2212m+1\u2212\u2308\nk\n2\u2309 \u2265\n4k\n3 \u2212 (\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309\u2212\nk\n3 )+1\u2212\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309 =\n5k\n3 \u2212 2\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309+ 1 =\n2k\n3 , which yields a contradiction.\nArguing in an analogous fashion with the vertex (\u230ak3 \u230b, \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\n3 \u2309) of AQ2,k, when\nk \u2261 1 (mod 3), and with the vertex (\u2308k3 \u2309, 2\u2308\nk\n3 \u2309) of AQ2,k, when k \u2261 2 (mod 3), yields\nthat the diameter of AQ2,k is \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309 irrespective of the value of k (mod 3).\nLet n \u2265 3 and v = (vn, vn\u22121, . . . , v1) be a vertex of AQn,k.\n21\nCase (i): k is even.\nDefine \u03a3ni=1|\nk\n2 \u2212 vi| = \u03b1. Traversing\nk\n2 (\u2264 n,\u22121)-edges from v leads to a vertex\nv\u2032 = (v\u2032n, v\n\u2032\nn\u22121, . . . , v\n\u2032\n1) such that \u03a3\nn\ni=1min{v\n\u2032\ni, k \u2212 v\n\u2032\ni} = \u03b1, and so by traversing\n(i,+1)-edges and (i,\u22121)-edges, for various i, as appropriate, we obtain a path of\nlength k2 + \u03b1 from v to 0. Alternatively, we could simply start from v and traverse\n(i,+1)-edges and (i,\u22121)-edges, as appropriate, to obtain a path of length nk2 \u2212\u03b1 from\nv to 0.\nSuppose that k2 +\u03b1 \u2264\nnk\n2 \u2212\u03b1, i.e., 2\u03b1 \u2264\nk\n2 (n\u2212 1). So, there is a path of length at\nmost k2 +\nk\n4 (n\u2212 1) =\nk\n4 (n+ 1) from v to 0. If 2\u03b1 >\nk\n2 (n\u2212 1) then there is a path of\nlength less than nk2 \u2212\nk\n4 (n\u2212 1) =\nk\n4 (n + 1) from v to 0. Thus, when k is even there\nis a path of length at most k4 (n+ 1) from v to 0.\nCase (ii): k is odd.\nWe proceed similarly to as in Case (i) but the numerics are slightly messier. Define\n\u03a3ni=1|\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309\u2212vi| = \u03b1. Similarly to as in Case (i), we obtain a path from v to 0 of length\nat most \u230ak2 \u230b+ \u03b1 and also one of length at most n\u2308\nk\n2\u2309 \u2212 \u03b1.\nSuppose that \u230ak2 \u230b + \u03b1 \u2264 n\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309 \u2212 \u03b1, i.e., 2\u03b1 \u2264 n\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309 \u2212 \u230a\nk\n2\u230b. So, there is a path of\nlength at most \u230ak2\u230b+\nn\n2 \u2308\nk\n2\u2309 \u2212\n1\n2\u230a\nk\n2\u230b \u2264\nk\n4 (n+ 1) +\nn\n4 from v to 0. If 2\u03b1 > n\u2308\nk\n2 \u2309 \u2212 \u230a\nk\n2 \u230b\nthen there is a path of length less than n\u2308k2\u2309 \u2212\nn\n2 \u2308\nk\n2\u2309+\n1\n2\u230a\nk\n2\u230b \u2264\nk\n4 (n + 1) +\nn\n4 . Thus,\nwhen k is odd there is a path of length at most k4 (n+ 1) +\nn\n4 from v to 0.\nNote that we only have an upper bound on the diameter of AQn,k, when n \u2265 3.\nAscertaining the exact value of the diameter appears to be combinatorially quite\nchallenging. However, we conjecture that our upper bound is actually quite close to\nthe true diameter.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have defined a new class of graphs, the class of augmented k-ary\nn-cubes, and we have examined these graphs in relation to some properties pertinent\nto their use as interconnection networks for parallel computing. We have tabulated\nour comparison between k-ary n-cubes and augmented k-ary n-cubes in Fig. 11.\nk-ary n-cube Qkn augmented k-ary n-cube AQn,k\nnumber of vertices\/edges kn\/nkn kn\/(2n\u2212 1)kn\nvertex-\/edge-symmetric yes\/yes yes\/no unless n = 2\nconnectivity 2n 4n\u2212 2\nwide-diameter (n \u2265 3) n\u230ak2\u230b+ 1 \u2264 max{(n\u2212 1)k \u2212 (n\u2212 2), k + 7}\nwide-diameter (n = 2) 2\u230ak2 \u230b+ 1 \u2264 k\ndiameter (n \u2265 3) n\u2308k2 \u2309 \u2264\nk\n4 (n+ 1) (k even)\n\u2264 k4 (n+ 1) +\nn\n4 (k odd)\ndiameter (n = 2) 2\u2308k2 \u2309 \u230a\nk\n3 \u230b+ \u2308\nk\u22121\n3 \u2309\nrouting O(nk) time O(nk) time\nFigure 11. A comparison between Qkn and AQn,k.\n22\nBoth AQn,k and Q\nk\nn have k\nn vertices, with the former having (n \u2212 1)kn more\nedges than the latter, and both interconnection networks are Cayley graphs, and\nso vertex-symmetric; however, AQn,k is not edge-symmetric, unless n = 2, whereas\nQkn is. AQn,k has a much improved connectivity of 4n \u2212 2 in comparison with the\nconnectivity of Qkn which is 2n, although this comes at the expense of an increased\nvertex degree, which is 4n \u2212 2 as opposed to 2n for the k-ary n-cube (both AQn,k\nand Qkn are \u2018maximally connected\u2019, in the sense that if disjoint paths are used to\ntransmit messages from one vertex to another in either network then there are no\nunused neighbours of the source vertex). We have also shown an upper bound on the\ndiameter of an augmented k-ary n-cube at roughly one half that of a k-ary n-cube.\nRecall that both the k-ary n-cube and the augmented k-ary n-cube come with\ntwo parameters which are both variable. Suppose that we have a k-ary n-cube, which\ninvolves kn vertices, and we wish to obtain an augmentedK-aryN -cube of comparable\nsize, but not necessarily by choosing the parameters N = n and K = k, so that the\ndegrees of the two networks are also comparable. Choose\nK =\nk\n2\nand N =\nn\n1\u2212 1log(k)\n(we assume for simplicity that both N and K are integral). Thus, kn = KN . More-\nover, the degree of the k-ary n-cube Qkn is 2n and the degree of the augmented K-ary\nN -cube AQN,K is\n4N \u2212 2 =\n4n\n1\u2212 1log(k)\n\u2212 2 \u2264\n4n\n1\u2212 1log(3)\n\u2212 2 < 11n\u2212 2,\nwith the diameter of Qkn being\nnk\n2 in comparison to an upper bound of\nK\n4\n(N + 1) =\nk\n8\n(\nn\n1\u2212 1log(k)\n+ 1) <\nnk\n2\n(0.68 +\n1\n4n\n)\non the diameter of AQN,K when k is even, and of\nK\n4\n(N + 1) +\nN\n4\n= N(\nK\n4\n+\n1\n4\n) +\nK\n4\n=\nn\n1\u2212 1log(k)\n(\nk\n8\n+\n1\n4\n) +\nk\n8\n<\nnk\n2\n(0.68 +\n1\nk \u2212 klog(k)\n+\n1\n4n\n)\non the diameter of AQN,K when k is odd (in both the even and odd case, this is\nasymptotically roughly two-thirds the diameter of Qkn). Note that the actual im-\nprovement in diameter could well be better than this, given that we have only given\nan upper bound as to the diameter of a AQN,K . In consequence, we conclude that\naugmented k-ary n-cubes can be regarded as improvements over k-ary n-cubes.\nWe have an additional and important comment to make. The augmented k-ary\nn-cube AQn,k is \u2018built on top\u2019 of the k-ary n-cube AQ\nk\nn; that is, Q\nk\nn is a spanning\nsubgraph of AQn,k. It is not as if we have simply chosen to argue that our network is\na viable network without even considering routing and broadcasting; for all routing\nand broadcasting algorithms which work for Qkn also work for AQn,k. Moreover, the\n23\nconstructions used in the proof of Proposition 10 yield a very simple routing algorithm\nof time complexity O(nk) (albeit possibly non-optimal).\nThere are numerous directions for further research. One obvious one is an exact\ncharacterization of the diameter of an augmented k-ary n-cube. However, even in the\nabsence of this exact characterization, our upper bound results still yield a significant\nimprovement. Whereas the wide-diameter of Qkn is n\u230a\nk\n2 \u230b + 1, the wide-diameter of\nAQn,k has an upper bound of \u2264 max{(n\u2212 1)k \u2212 (n\u2212 2), k + 7}, when n \u2265 3, and k,\nwhen n = 2. This is possibly to be expected, given that we are constructing 4n\u2212 2\npaths in AQn,k whereas only 2n paths need to be constructed in Q\nk\nn. Nevertheless,\nit would be interesting to try and improve upon our wide-diameter bound and bring\nit closer to the diameter of AQn,k.\nFinally, there are numerous other aspects relating to augmented k-ary n-cubes\nwhich are worthy of study: for example, the embedding of other networks in AQn,k\n(cf. [4, 5, 12]), the tolerance of faults within AQn,k (cf. [5, 6]), and broadcasting and\nrouting in AQn,k (cf. [3, 12]).\nReferences\n[1] N.R. Adiga, M.A. Blumrich, D. Chen, P. Coteus, A. Gara, M.E.
