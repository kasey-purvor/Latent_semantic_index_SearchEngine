I would like to thank the Durham Human Rights Centre for nurturing \nthis article, and Professor Hugh Collins and anonymous referees of the Modern Law Review for their \ninvaluable suggestions.  Any errors are of course my own. \nArticle 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which guarantees the \nenjoyment of other Convention rights and freedoms without discrimination, is often \nunhelpfully described as being \u2018parasitic\u20191 or as having \u2018no independent existence.\u20192  \nCourts and commentators could describe the relationship between Article 14 and the \nother Convention rights with less loaded language, like \u2018the primary function of Article \n14, essentially, is in protecting the [non-discriminatory] distribution of the other human \nrights protected by the ECHR.\u20193   The fashionable resort to more trenchant epithets \nsuggests an impulse to scold Article 14 for its superfluity, as if to remind a poor relation \nof its dependence on its betters.  While a need no doubt exists for courts and the legal \ncommunity to remember that Article 14 provides no freestanding protection of \ndiscrimination, and to distinguish it from, for example, Protocol 12,4 or the Equal \nProtection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, \noveremphasising the contingent nature of Article 14 obscures its autonomous significance \nand contributes to an overly restrictive understanding of its scope and application.  It is \nunfortunate that Article 14 cannot cover all discrimination by the state, especially \nbecause the gaps in its coverage are said to include the distribution of significant social \n                                                 \n1 Whaley v Lord Advocate [2004] SC 78, para 93. \n2 Chassagnou v France (1999) 29 EHRR 615, para 18. \n3 C. McCrudden, \u2018Equality and Non-Discrimination\u2019 in D Feldman (ed) English Public Law (Oxford; OUP \n2004), para 11.86. \n4 The Council of Europe has voted to add to the ECHR Protocol 12, which prohibits state discrimination \nwithout limitation to the enjoyment of other Convention rights and freedoms.  It has not as yet been ratified \nby a sufficient number of signatory states to come into force; the UK, for instance, has not ratified it.     \ngoods like employment5 and, bizarrely, some aspects of education.6  However, it does \nnothing for the cause of equality to bemoan the shortcomings of Article 14, and \ncommiserate with judges who feel compelled to give unnecessarily short shrift to its \nprotections.   \nThis article argues for a thoroughly reworked conception of the scope of Article \n14\u2014specifically under the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) in the United Kingdom, but \nalong lines that can and should be adopted in other signatory states and by the European \nCourt of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg.  By \u2018scope\u2019 I refer to the heavily \ncriticised circumscription of Article 14 within the area of \u2018enjoyment of the rights and \nfreedoms set forth in [the] Convention\u2019.  The Strasbourg Court employs the term \u2018ambit\u2019 \nto refer to this area of Article 14\u2019s application: a shorthand for the idea that a subject of \ngovernment regulation might fail to attract the direct protection of, say, Article 8 (the \nright to respect for private and family life), but that it could nevertheless involve the \n\u2018enjoyment\u2019 of the right \u2018set forth\u2019 in Article 8, and thus engage Article 14.  The facts of \na case must come within the ambit of another Convention right before Article 14 can \napply at all.  Many domestic judges appear to interpret the ambit in light of their \nperception of Article 14 as \u2018parasitic,\u2019 and hence conclude that Article 14 exists purely to \n\u2018inform\u2019 and \u2018expand on\u2019 the meaning of other rights.7  This leads them to conceive of \n                                                 \n5 S Livingstone, \u2018Article 14 and the Prevention of Discrimination in the European Convention on Human \nRights\u2019 (1997) 1 EHRLR 25, 26; cf Sidabras and Dziautas v Lithuania [2004] ECHR 395. \n6 See, eg, R (Douglas) v North Tyneside MBC [2004] HRLR 14, para 56. \n7 See, eg, Clarke v Sec\u2019y State for Environment, Transport, and the Regions [2001] EWHC Admin 800, \npara 5. \nthe ambit as a slightly extended version of the protective scope of the other more \n\u2018substantive\u2019 articles.  \nI contend that to understand the ambit courts must come to terms with what \nArticle 14 protects, not with what other Convention articles protect.  A case alleging \ndiscrimination in the enjoyment of the right to privacy set forth in Article 8 cannot be \nresolved through an understanding of what Article 8 guarantees by way of protection \nfrom state action alleged to invade privacy.  A court must construct an understanding of \nwhat it means to suffer discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to privacy, which \nmust draw from an appreciation of the difference between enjoying the right to privacy, \nas protected by Article 14, and being entitled to the specific protections, as against the \nstate, provided for in Article 8.  I seek in this article to begin the process of constructing \nthat understanding.   \nThe first section below introduces the problem of the ambit, outlining and \nillustrating four conceptions of the ambit, the fourth of which is my own proposed new \nconception.   The second section lays down a foundation of principles to guide the \napplication of Article 14.  The next three sections employ these principles to critically \nevaluate the first three conceptions, explaining how and why they fail to give effect to the \napparent aims of Article 14 and demonstrating their inconsistency with the weight of \nStrasbourg precedent.  The article concludes by explaining and defending a proposed \nfourth conception of the ambit that is true to the aims of Article 14 and the HRA, and \nconsistent with both Strasbourg learning and a UK conception of the rights set out in the \nConvention.   \n \n THE AMBIT, THE UK JUDICIARY, AND THE FOUR CONCEPTIONS \n \nThe text of Article 14 does not provide clear instructions for a judiciary accustomed, \nbefore the HRA, to judicial review and the application anti-discrimination statutes:   \n \nThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this convention shall be \nsecured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, \nreligion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a \nnational minority, property, birth or other status. \n \nNothing in the language of Article 14 unambiguously directs the focus of the judicial \ninquiry, leaving courts to decide several questions whose answers can radically change \nthe outcomes of cases.  What does it mean to \u2018enjoy\u2019 rights and freedoms?  What is \ndiscrimination?  Are we concerned with identifying state action that has the quality of \nbeing \u2018discriminatory\u2019, or are we concerned with experiences of state action that affect \npeople as \u2018discrimination\u2019?  It should not be surprising if UK judges have tended to \nanswer such questions in ways that make Article 14 feel more like the statutory \ndiscrimination or judicial review cases more familiar to them. \nOf course, domestic courts have not been called upon to answer these questions \nentirely without guidance.  First, the ECtHR has made it clear that the area described by \n\u2018the enjoyment of Convention rights\u2019 is not the same as the area directly protected by \nother Convention articles.  Strasbourg has recognised that it would render Article 14 \nsuperfluous and absurd to hold that it could only prohibit unequal treatment with regard \nto matters already guaranteed against state encroachment by other articles.  Therefore, \nArticle 14 has been found to prohibit, for example, the discriminatory provision of \nbenefits related to family life, even if Article 8 would not by itself require the granting of \nsuch benefits as a matter of the core protection of the right to family life: if the state \nchooses to promote a Convention right beyond the requirements of the ECHR, Article 14 \nrequires that it do so equally.8  A great deal of disagreement remains as to how far the \narea of \u2018enjoyment\u2019 exceeds the protective scope of the other Convention articles\u2014\nindeed that is what the entire ambit question is about\u2014but there is no question that it \ndoes.   \nSecond, Strasbourg precedent has clarified that discrimination means \u2018unjustified \ndiscrimination\u2019, which in turn means the use of a distinction that either does not pursue a \nlegitimate aim, or does not satisfy \u2018proportionality,\u2019 in that it produces discriminatory \neffects disproportionate to the advancement of that aim secured by the measure.9  This \nmeans that the Article 14 analysis, once engaged, involves a step in which the court may \ntake account of issues such as whether the state intended to discriminate, or to affect \nConvention rights, and must determine whether these considerations can justify any \n                                                 \n8 Abdulaziz v United Kingdom [1985] ECHR 7, para 82; R (Carson) v Secretary for Work and Pensions \n[2003] EWCA Civ 797, paras 36-41; R. Wintemute, \u2018 \u201cWithin the Ambit\u201d: How Big Is the \u201cGap\u201d in Article \n14 European Convention on Human Rights?\u2019 [2004] EHRLR 366, 370; A. Pedain, \u2018The Human Rights \nDimension of the Diane Pretty Case\u2019 (2003) 62 CLJ 181, 195-198; S. Grosz, J. Beatson, and P. Duffy, \nHuman Rights: The 1998 Act and the European Convention (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2000), para 5-23. \n9 Belgian Linguistics (1968) 1 EHRR 252, 283; see also A and Ors v Home Secretary [2004] UKHL 56, \npara 50; Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza, [2004] UKHL 30, para 133. \ndemonstrated burden on a claimant\u2019s equal enjoyment of Convention rights.  The courts \nneed not, therefore, constrict the ambit in order to screen out cases where the state acted \n\u2018innocently\u2019, and to do so short-circuits an important step in the discrimination analysis.  \nFinally, section 6 HRA makes it \u2018unlawful for a [court] to act in a way which is \nincompatible with a Convention right,\u2019 without express authority from Parliament; \nsection 3(1) goes further to require judges \u2018[s]o far as it is possible to do so\u2019 to read and \n\u2018give effect\u2019 to legislation in a way compatible with Convention rights.  This tells the UK \ncourts, in essence, that HRA cases must turn on whether state action has the effect of \nburdening the right protected by Article 14, not on whether the state intended or \ncontemplated an effect on that or any other Convention right.10  This provides another \nreason not to define the ambit according to the aims of the state. \n UK judges have not, unfortunately, consistently acknowledged the implications of \nthis guidance when giving content to the ambit.  They have tended instead either to focus \non the judicial review-like question of the quality of the impugned state decision, or on \nthe anti-discrimination statute-like question of whether the challenged act or measure \nfalls within clearly identified protected areas, determinable by reference to the wording of \nConvention articles and the body of precedent associated with their protections.  These \ntendencies have led most UK judges to constrict the ambit by employing one of the \n                                                 \n10 See, eg, F. Klug, \u2018The Human Rights Act\u2014A \u201cThird Way\u201d or \u201cThird Wave\u201d Bill of Rights\u2019 [2001] \nEHRLR 361, 370-371; M. Elliott, \u2018The HRA 1998 and the Standard of Substantive Review,\u2019 (2001) 60 \nCLJ 301, 304-308; I. Leigh, \u2018Taking Rights Proportionately: Judicial Review, the Human Rights Act and \nStrasbourg,\u2019 [2002] PL 265, 282-286; J. Jowell, \u2018Beyond the Rule of Law: Towards Constitutional Judicial \nReview,\u2019 [2000] PL 671, 671-676, 682; P. Craig, Administrative Law (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 4th ed, \n1999) 546, 556-557, 561. \nfollowing conceptions of its scope: (1) defining it as the area that would be protected by \nConvention rights before any exceptions, justifications, or margins of appreciation are \napplied (their prima facie protective scope), (2) confining the ambit to situations where \nthe impugned state measure or decision intentionally concerns itself with another \nConvention right, or (3) allowing the ambit to exist beyond the prima facie scope of other \narticles, but tethering it to that protective area, and viewing the ambit as a mere \nmodification of the protective scope of \u2018substantive\u2019 articles.   \nNone of these approaches gives proper effect to Article 14, for reasons that this \narticle makes clear below.  The most glaring problem with these conceptions, however, is \nthat none of them flow from an analysis of what Article 14 says or what it appears \nintended to achieve.  Such an analysis leads to a fourth approach, which is the one that I \npropose and defend in this piece: the ambit is the area in which a person can be said to be \n\u2018enjoying\u2019 another Convention right; the boundaries of this area must be drawn only by \nreference to an ordinary understanding, in the relevant society, of when a person can be \nsaid to be enjoying, for example, privacy, liberty, or free expression, and without \nreference to the core of those rights as protected against state encroachment by the \nrelevant Convention articles; and the facts of a case enter into the ambit any time a state \ndecision or measure directly or indirectly, intentionally, accidentally, or even \nunforeseeably has the effect of impairing the ability of an individual or group to enjoy the \nright in question on a basis of equality with the rest of society.  It must be kept in mind \nthat satisfying this relatively expansive test would merely allow Article 14 to apply to a \ngiven case, and would not compel a finding of discrimination or preclude a decision that \nthe state action was justified.   \nThe next section lays a foundation for assessing the four conceptions set out \nabove, by teasing out the principles for interpretation and application of Article 14 that \nemerge from its text and from Strasbourg case law.  The sections thereafter will evaluate \neach conception in turn. \n \n \nFOUNDATION PRINCIPLES FOR THE AMBIT \n \nArticle 14 seeks equality above the line of core protection  \n \nA reading of the words of Article 14 without reference to any other article indicates that \nthe framers of the ECHR contemplated that the states party to the Convention might, in \naddition to encroaching on specific guaranteed rights, arrange things in such a way that \nsome people would have advantages in their enjoyment of rights as against other people \nin the same society.  \u2018The enjoyment of [Convention] rights . . . shall be secured without \ndiscrimination . . .\u2019 admonishes signatory governments to guarantee that no individual or \ngroup will experience discrimination\u2014a disadvantage in the distribution of social \ngoods11\u2014involving their enjoyment of the benefits of living in a society protected by the \n                                                 \n11 See, eg, A. McColgan, Discrimination Law: text, cases and materials (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2000) \n20-22; H. Collins, \u2018Discrimination, Equality, and Social Exclusion,\u2019 (2003) 66 MLR 16, 21-22; R. Singh, \n\u2018Equality: The Neglected Virtue,\u2019 [2004] EHRLR 141, 148-149; C. Barnard and B. Hepple, \u2018Substantive \nEquality\u2019 (2000) 59 CLJ 562, 564-567.  Cf N. Bamforth, \u2018Conceptions of Anti-Discrimination Law\u2019 (2004) \n24 OJLS 693,703-715, arguing, inter alia, that disadvantage cannot justify anti-discrimination regulation. \nECHR.   \u2018Discrimination\u2019 has been defined, in international instruments, to include a \n\u2018distinction, exclusion, or preference . . . which nullifies or impairs equality of \nopportunity or treatment.\u201912  Read in this light, questions of the engagement of Article 14 \nshould turn on whether the extent to which an individual can enjoy a Convention right on \na basis of equality with the rest of society has been impaired, inadvertently or otherwise, \nby a government measure or decision.13   \nThis formulation of course begs the question of what it means to \u2018enjoy\u2019 a \nConvention right.  Article 14 facially furnishes no support for limiting the scope of \u2018the \nenjoyment of the right set out in Article A\u2019 by reference to the extent of protection \nafforded by Article A.  Indeed, the very fact that we draw a line representing the limit of \nprotection afforded by a given article suggests that there is an area below that line where \nwe are not enjoying the right in question, and it is therefore \u2018violated\u2019, and an area above \nthe line where it is not violated and we can be said to be \u2018enjoying\u2019 it.  Thus the outer \nboundary of the area of enjoyment of Convention rights has no necessary relationship \nwith the \u2018protective scope\u2019 boundary. \nThe temptation to tie the ambit to the areas protected by other Convention articles \ncomes in part from the facile assumption that the only effects of the ECHR and the HRA \non the enjoyment of rights must flow from the line-drawing exercise in which the courts \nengage.  The fact that the UK honours the rights set out in the Convention means that \nconcerns about, say, family life, freedom of expression, or liberty are taken into account \n                                                 \n12 See, eg, the International Labour Organisation\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, Convention 111 (stripped \nof labour-specific language). \n13 This refers only to what Robert Wintemute calls the \u2018opportunity\u2019 route into Article 14, as opposed to the \n\u2018ground\u2019 route.  Wintemute, n 8 above, 370-371.   \nin the development of policy, in the enactment of legislation, in the state\u2019s executive \ndecisions, and through \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 ECHR rights into public debate.14  It is only \nwhen the courts get involved\u2014when the other effects of respect for Convention rights \nfail to prevent the state from appearing to encroach too far into the area of, for example, \nprivacy\u2014that a line must be drawn representing the protected core of the right of privacy.  \nWhen a court draws this line, and in so doing identifies the prima facie scope of \nprotection afforded by Article 8(1), it is identifying only one part of the substance and \nmeaning of the privacy right set out in the Convention.  In other words, the prima facie \ncoverage of Article 8 does not define the domestic conception of the right to privacy.  \nInstead, it describes the area of privacy into which the state may not venture without \nbeing called upon, under the ECHR, to justify its actions.  This is a singular inquiry \nwhich, because it is necessitated by a claim that the state has gone too far, must define the \ncore of the right by reference to the kinds of activities that should be secure from \ngovernment intrusion.   \nThe courts must appreciate that this conception of privacy is fit only for the \npurpose that gave rise to it, and not for other purposes.  If the government enacts a data \nprotection measure that Article 8(1) could not require it to enact, we nevertheless see it as \ndemonstrating respect for the \u2018right to privacy.\u2019  In basking in the secure feeling fostered \nby the measure I am enjoying my right to privacy even though the prima facie protections \nof Article 8 would not forbid its retraction.  Thus there are at least two conceptions of \n                                                 \n14 See generally Klug, n 10 above; J. Hiebert, \u2018Parliamentary Bills of Rights: an Alternative Model?\u2019 (2006) \n69 MLR 7. \nprivacy\u2014the ordinary one and the adjudicative, protective one\u2014both of which have a \nlegitimate place in the ECHR and HRA schemes.   \nAlthough privacy offers a particularly strong example of this point, it holds true \nfor other Convention rights as well.  In Belgian Linguistics, the first articulation of \nStrasbourg Article 14 jurisprudence, the Court cited, as examples of how the ambit \nextends beyond the protective scope of other articles, (1) a situation where the state \noffered an educational establishment not required by Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the \nConvention, yet Article 14 would prohibit discriminatory entrance exams and (2) a \nreference to the fact that Article 6 does not require appellate courts, but Article 14 would \nforbid the state to \u2018debar\u2019 some groups from appellate courts but not others.15  Clearly, \nthen, one enjoys the ordinary right to education in one\u2019s own society under Article 2 \nProtocol 1 when one seeks an equal opportunity to enter an establishment that would not \nbe viewed as a part of the ECHR protected core of education.  Similarly, we can \nunderstand an ordinary right to a fair trial in the UK involving equal access to an appeal, \ndespite the fact that the protected core of the right to a fair trial does not extend that far.  \nMore recently Lord Justice Laws was required by Strasbourg precedent to accept the, for \nhim, distasteful notion that Article 14 together with Article 1 of Protocol 1 could apply to \nthe distribution of existing pension benefits despite the fact that Article 1 could not \nrequire the state to provide the pension in the first place, as part of the core of the right to \npossessions.16 \n                                                 \n15 (1968) 1 EHRR 252, para 9. \n16 Carson (CA) [2003] EWCA Civ 797, paras 32-40. \nEach of the foregoing examples could be explained, as some UK judges have \nsought to, as supporting the second conception of the ambit set out in the last section: a \nrule that courts should confine the ambit to areas where the state has intentionally sought \nto regulate in support of the right in question.  Thus in R (Erskine) v Lambeth London \nBorough Council the court relied on the fact that the state sought to regulate health and \nsafety, not home life, to preclude the engagement of Article 14 coupled with Article 8, \ndespite evidence of an unintended impact on home life.17  As I argue more fully below, \nsuch a rule flies in the face of Strasbourg teaching from such cases as Thlimmenos v \nGreece18 and Sidabras and Dziautas v Lithuania,19 and naively puts the state in \npossession of the perfect means of avoiding Article 14 scrutiny: disclaiming any intention \nto regulate ECHR rights.  The fact that courts find the ambit to exist where the state \nsupports Convention rights beyond the direct requirements of the relevant articles, \nregardless of whether they view this as necessary or merely sufficient to establish the \nambit, demonstrates that they conceive of an area, beyond the protective core of ECHR \nrights, in which regulation can be said to promote the rights in \u2018set out in\u2019 the \nConvention.    \nWhether they articulate it or not, many judges clearly assume that beyond the \nboundary of the protective core of a Convention right lies an unprotected area \nnevertheless linked to the right.  For example, in Karlheinz Schmidt v Germany the \nECtHR carefully observed that paragraph 3 of Article 4 operated not to \u2018limit\u2019 the right \n                                                 \n17 [2003] EWHC Admin 2479, para 34; see also R (Morris) v Westminster CC [2004] EWHC 2191, paras \n10-15. \n18 [2000] ECHR 162. \n19 [2004] ECHR 395. \nagainst forced labour, but to \u2018delimit\u2019 it, or describe the content of the right.20  Having \nthus explained that paragraph 3 was not an \u2018exception,\u2019 but instead had the effect of \nexcluding \u2018normal civic obligations\u2019 from the definition of the right protected by Article \n4, it found that men-only compulsory fire service was a normal civic obligation and \nhence, by definition, not forced labour within the meaning of Article 4.21  Despite this \nclear exclusion of the protections of Article 4, the Court held that the challenged measure, \na compensatory payment in lieu of service imposed only on men, came within the ambit \nof Article 4 for Article 14 purposes.  There could be no argument in Karlheinz that the \nstate sought to regulate to \u2018promote\u2019 the right to unforced labour, or even to regulate \nArticle 4 compulsory labour at all.  The state simply decided to extract a normal civic \nobligation, outside the protective scope of Article 4, from men but not women and, when \nthe need for the actual labour diminished, levied a compensatory fee on those who did not \ncare to serve, to assure fairness among men.  The Strasbourg judges, however, took the \nnatural view that there is an ordinary idea of \u2018compulsory labour,\u2019 and as a compulsory \nlevy in lieu of civic service clearly implicated this ordinary idea, the protections of article \n14 should apply. \nOther cases discussed in this article illustrate the point further.  The dissent of \nLord Justice Neuberger in Home Secretary v Hindawi22 and the unanimous decision in R \n(Clift) v Home Secretary,23 which receive greater attention in subsequent sections, \nexemplify judicial recognition of an ordinary understanding of liberty that exists beyond \n                                                 \n20 (1994) 18 EHRR 513, para 22. \n21 (1994) 18 EHRR 513, para 23. \n22 [2004] EWCA Civ 1309, paras 57-83 (Neuberger, LJ). \n23 [2004] EWCA Civ 514, paras 14-18. \nthe protective scope of Article 5.  Thlimmenos v Greece, also elaborated on below, \nillustrates an ordinary understanding of the right to freedom of religion only tenuously \nconnected to the direct protections of Article 9.  Although an article-by-article proof of \nthe existence of the dichotomy exceeds the scope of this piece, the foregoing examples \nshould suffice to demonstrate that judges understand that the conception of a right \ndeveloped as a core defence against interference by the state is more constricted than the \nordinary conception of that right.  If an ordinary understanding of Convention rights \nexists outside the protective scope of Convention articles, then surely the \u2018enjoyment\u2019 of \nrights set out in the Convention must refer to activities within this ordinary \nunderstanding. \nArticle 14 cannot have been intended to allow the state to introduce measures that \ncreate inequalities in the area of ordinary privacy, freedom of religion, or liberty, simply \nbecause the protective core of Articles 8, 9, or 5 would not, theoretically, prevent the \nstate from eliminating that area altogether in a non-discriminatory way.  The protective \nconception is merely the core of the ordinary conception: the part any state must always \njustify invading.  Therefore, there is no reason to define the ambit of a Convention right \nby reference, in any way, to the protective scope of the relevant article, because the latter \nis, in fact, a subset of the former, tightly circumscribed for reasons relating to the \nprerogatives of the state.  The protective scope is derivative of the area of enjoyment of \nrights\u2014not the other way around\u2014so protective scope logic with its focus on state \nprerogatives has no place whatsoever in defining the contours of the ambit. \n  \nJustification is the place for state prerogatives and \u2018protective scope\u2019 logic \n \nIf it seems that the aims of the state should, in some way, influence the application of \nArticle 14, this is not the business of the ambit.  Strasbourg jurisprudence has provided an \nanalytical step, justification, where the prerogatives of the state can weigh in the analysis, \nbut only proportionally. The ECtHR, in Belgian Linguistics, read the word \n\u2018discrimination\u2019 in the article to mean \u2018unjustified discrimination\u2019.24  This interpretation \nmeans that a state distinction that affects the equal enjoyment of Convention rights is \nunlawful discrimination unless justified.25  To justify prima facie discrimination the state \nmust demonstrate that its measure does not produce discriminatory effects \ndisproportionate to the advancement of government interests secured by the measure.26  \nEvery regulatory distinction that comes within the ambit must satisfy proportionality:   \n \nA difference of treatment in the exercise of a right laid down in the Convention \nmust not only pursue a legitimate aim; Article 14 is likewise violated when it is \n                                                 \n24 (1968) 1 EHRR 252, 283-284. \n25 Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, paras 39-49; Gaygusus (1997) 23 EHRR 364, paras 36-42; D. Feldman, \nCivil Liberties and Human Rights in England and Wales (Oxford: OUP, 2nd ed, 2002) 144; Livingstone, n 5 \nabove, 32-33; Grosz, Beatson and Duffy, n 8 above, paras C14-20-C14-23.   \n26 A and Ors [2004] UKHL 56, para 50; Ghaidan, [2004] UKHL 30, para 133. \nclearly established that there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality \nbetween the means employed and the aim sought to be realized.27 \n \nHere, then, is the natural analytical step by which courts can redeem government actions \nwhich, although they appear to leave an individual or group with a diminished enjoyment \nof a Convention right, do not pursue or perpetuate invidious bias, or have minimal \nimpacts compared with the benefits achieved.   \nThere is no reason to fear letting the disposition of most Article 14 cases turn on \nwhether the state can justify its measure in light of the requirements of proportionality.  \nProportionality justification is a fundamental part of how Article 14 identifies what is and \nis not \u2018unlawful discrimination.\u2019  The fact that the state has used a distinction\u2014has \n\u2018discriminated\u2019 in the generic sense\u2014that burdens the equal enjoyment of a Convention \nright does not mean that any human right has been invaded at all.  It is only where the \nunequal burden fails to satisfy a proportionality review that we say Article 14 \ndiscrimination has occurred.28  Thus it is neither necessary nor appropriate to use a \nnarrowed ambit to save the state\u2019s blushes. \nMoreover, the HRA appears to encourage the UK judiciary to analyse ECHR \nclaims in a way that emphasizes the effects of measures on individuals, rather than the \naims of those measures.  It is well acknowledged that one of the purposes of the HRA is \nto call to account state actors for any impairment of Convention rights, intentional or \n                                                 \n27 (1968) 1 EHRR 252, 283-284. \n28 Elliott, n 10, 330-331. \notherwise.29    Section 6 HRA makes it unlawful for the courts to make decisions \ninconsistent with Convention rights except on clear Parliamentary authority, in which \ncase the court is to issue a \u2018declaration of incompatibility\u2019 under section 4.  Thus the \ncourts have explicit responsibility for the life a decision or measure takes on after it has \nbeen made, which can only be understood through examining its impact.30  Section 3(1) \nHRA requires UK courts to read domestic statutes consistently with Convention rights \neven where to do so might change the \u2018natural meaning\u2019 of the words used by \nParliament.31  In other words, the HRA intends not only that laws or decisions comply \nwith human rights at the time of their birth, as it were, but that the end result of their \ninteraction with the outside world\u2014with other state institutions, with executive \ndiscretion, with the actual lives of individual people, and with the courts\u2014does not \nultimately violate human rights.32  This means that where the analysis of an alleged \nviolation of ECHR rights calls for a prima facie finding followed by a justification, as in \nArticle 14 and Articles 8 to 11, then the prima facie analysis must exclude considerations \nthat would tend to direct the focus to what the state meant to do, or to foreseeable effects \n                                                 \n29 See, eg, Klug, n 10 above, 370-371; Elliott, n 10 above, 304-308; Leigh, n 10 above, 282-286; Jowell, n \n10 above, 671-676, 682; Craig, n 10 above, 546, 556-557, 561. \n30 Ghaidan [2004] UKHL 30, para 22 (\u2018the compatibility of legislation with the Convention rights falls to \nbe assessed when the issue arises for determination, not as at the date when the legislation was enacted or \ncame into force\u2019). \n31 A.

The prima facie analysis, including the ambit question, can \nonly serve the aims of the HRA by focusing on the effects of regulation on claimants. \nThe ECtHR illustrated how to maintain this focus in Thlimmenos v Greece, where \nit found that a provision forbidding a person with a serious criminal conviction from \nreceiving an appointment as a chartered accountant, violated the applicant\u2019s Article 14 \nrights by failing to distinguish between convictions based on the exercise of religious \nfreedom and other convictions.33  The claimant had earlier received a criminal conviction \nfor refusing to serve in the armed forces because of his beliefs as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.  \nThe Court in Thlimmenos approached the analysis from a direction markedly different \nfrom the run of UK decisions.  Although the claimant alleged violations of Article 9 \nalone and of Article 14 taken together with Article 9, a situation in which a domestic \ncourt almost invariably would have analysed the Article 9 claim first,34 the ECtHR \naddressed Article 14 first (as indeed it did in Sidabras).35  It did so in a way that treated \nArticle 9 as the \u2018informing\u2019 article, exploring the nature and intended effects of Article 14 \nbefore any mention of the scope of Article 9.     \nThe Court noted, uncontroversially, that \u2018it suffices that the facts of the case fall \nwithin the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols.\u2019 The \nchoice of which facts must be found to have entered the ambit can determine the outcome \nof a case.  If \u2018the facts\u2019 are the aims of the state in implementing the challenged measure, \nas could be appropriate in examining whether a measure invades the core of rights \n                                                 \n33 Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, paras 42-44. \n34 See, eg, R (Pretty) v DPP [2002] AC 800. \n35 Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, paras 33-53. \nprotected against state action by Article 9, the Court might have found that the state\u2019s \nneutral intention to prevent criminals from securing sensitive accounting positions failed \nto encroach on the area of Article 9\u2019s engagement.  Instead, the Court identified \u2018the \nfacts\u2019 by reference to Article 14, not Article 9, which meant that it focused on the relative \ndisadvantage suffered by the claimant.36  The Court thus concluded that \u2018the facts\u2019 that \nmust come within the ambit consisted of what happened to the claimant, specifically \u2018his \nbeing treated as a person convicted of a serious crime for the purposes of appointment to \na chartered accountant\u2019s post despite the fact that the offence for which he had been \nconvicted was prompted by his religious beliefs.\u201937  Viewing the question in this way, the \nStrasbourg judges had no trouble finding that a person seeking an accounting position, \ndespite having criminally unpopular religious views about military service, was trying \nthereby to \u2018enjoy\u2019 his right to freedom of religion, and that the challenged measure thus \nburdened that enjoyment as compared to those without such views.   \nTwo clear principles emerge from this example: (1) the facts that must enter the \nambit to engage Article 14 are the experiences of claimants, to the extent those \nexperiences demonstrate an unequal governmental impact on claimants\u2019 enjoyment of \nConvention rights; and (2) it is neither necessary nor appropriate to tie the boundaries of \nthe ambit\u2014the area those facts must enter\u2014to the protective boundaries of the \nsubstantive right invoked along with Article 14.  The Court in Thlimmenos viewed the \nambit question as turning on whether the state measure produced unequal effects within \nthe area of \u2018enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of [the] Convention\u2019 which the state \n                                                 \n36 ibid paras 39-42. \n37 ibid para 42. \nwas bound to \u2018secure without discrimination.\u2019  As a result, what would generally be \nreferred to as \u2018the ambit of Article 9\u2019 was found to include activities not protected by \nArticle 9 or any other article (seeking, as opposed to keeping, a particular job); state aims \nand methods not impugned by any Convention article (criminal convictions for \nconscientious objection, excluding criminals from professions to protect the public); and \na burden connected to the practice of religion, as protected by Article 9, only in the most \ntenuous and indirect way, and apparently suffered only by a class of one.    \nWhat the Thlimmenos decision shows is that it makes no sense to talk about the \nambit of Article 9 as a function of the protections afforded by Article 9.  Article 9 does \nnot require the state to guarantee, or justify the absence of, access to a particular \noccupation on the ground of religion; nor did it matter to the Court in Thlimmenos \nwhether Article 9 requires the state to justify criminalising conscientious objection.38  \nSimilarly, the measure challenged in the case in no way encroached on any of the aspects \nof the practice of religion directly protected by Article 9.39  How then can one derive the \nambit recognised in Thlimmenos from Article 9?  The answer provided by Thlimmenos is \nthat one need not and should not try: one should derive the ambit from Article 14.  \nAccording to the ECtHR in Thlimmenos, a person \u2018enjoys\u2019 the right set out in Article 9 \nwithout discrimination by arranging his or her life, private and public, according to his or \nher religious beliefs, without suffering burdens not imposed on other groups in the same \nsociety: the ordinary freedom of religion.   \n                                                 \n38 Ahmad v UK (1982) 4 EHRR 126; Stedman v UK (1997) 23 EHRR CD; Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, \nparas 41, 43. \n39 Ahmad (1982) 4 EHRR 126; Stedman (1997) 23 EHRR CD. \nA confusing aspect of the Thlimmenos case comes from the fact that the state \nimposed a differential burden on the claimant\u2019s enjoyment of his right to religion on the \nground of his religion.  In other words, religion provided both the basis for distinction \nand the right whose enjoyment suffered a distinct burden: the case might have been \nbrought on the ground that only men received convictions for religious conscientious \nobjection, and then the ground of distinction would have been gender.40  In Thlimmenos \nit was the impairment of the ability to live life according to one\u2019s religious beliefs on a \nbasis of equality with others, whether those others be of different genders, religions, or \nraces, that engaged Article 14 according to Strasbourg.   \nThis very open textured view of the ambit, derived without reference to the \nprotective scope of the \u2018substantive\u2019 article, provides a model for the fourth, \u2018new\u2019 \nconception of the ambit, which the final section of this piece fleshes out and defends.  \nThe next three sections, however, demonstrate how the three more fashionable \nconceptions yield an inadequate ambit and undermine the proper application of Article \n14. \n \n \nAGAINST CONCEPTION (1): ARTICLE 14 IS NOT  \nAN EXCEPTION TO EXCEPTIONS \n \n                                                 \n40 See Wintemute, n 8 above, 370-371, for an argument that Article 14 is engaged when the ground of \ndiscrimination (e.g. religion) falls within the ambit of a Convention article (e.g. Article 9), even if the \nactivity affected does not fall within the ambit of a Convention right. \nThe first conception views the ambit as, for example, the area protected by Article 8(1), \nwhere a court feels that a measure would violate Article 8 but for the application of an \nArticle 8(2) exception.  The state would be permitted, on proof of justification, to \npenetrate that protected area, so long as it does not discriminate.  Article 14 would \ntherefore come into play only to prevent discriminatory exceptions to the prima facie \nguarantees of other Convention rights.  With regard to rights without justification \nexceptions, Article 14 would operate only in areas where the protective requirements of \nthe other article left some discretion to the state as to the precise content of its \ncompliance.  Thus, for example, where Article 6 would accept a variety of types of \nprocedure as satisfying the right to a fair trial, Article 14 would require that the state\u2019s \nchoices among those options not discriminate.  This conception was articulated by Laws, \nLJ in Carson\u2014and then rejected, as the Lord Justice was forced to acknowledge that \nECtHR precedent required him to relinquish it in favour of a broader view of the ambit.41  \nNevertheless, many domestic judges approach the question of whether Article 14 can \napply as turning on whether the other Convention article is prima facie \u2018engaged.\u2019  \nThe most immediate problem with this conception is that it is flatly contradicted \nby Strasbourg authority.42  In addition, it would mean, in effect, that Article 14 only \nprotects the individual against the discriminatory application of exceptions to Convention \nrights.  If that had been what the framers intended, they could have put the point across \nmuch better.  It seems a strained reading to derive \u2018the state shall only impair Convention \n                                                 \n41 [2003] EWCA Civ 797, paras 32-40. \n42 See, eg, Belgian Linguistics (1968) 1 EHRR 252, 283; Abdulaziz [1985] ECHR 7, para 82; Ghaidan \n[2004] UKHL 30, para 135. \nrights, in pursuit of public order, health, etc. in a non-discriminatory way\u2019 from \u2018[t]he \nenjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured \nwithout discrimination.\u2019  In short, \u2018discrimination in the enjoyment of a Convention right\u2019 \nmust mean more than \u2018discriminatory application of an exception permitting \nencroachment on a Convention right.\u2019 \n Antje Pedain views the ambit of Convention rights that have justification \nexceptions, such as Articles 8 through 11, as coextensive with their prima facie scope, \nbut argues for a broader reach of that scope than the courts have recognised.43  Pedain \ndefines the prima facie coverage of Article 8 through the concept of \u2018Hohfeldian\u2019 \nliberties.  Hohfeld differentiated rights and liberties according to the state of the law as it \nexists in a society, such that I have the \u2018liberty\u2019 to do what nobody can legally demand \nthat I not do, and I have the \u2018right\u2019 to do what I can legally demand that others not \nprevent me from doing.  Pedain argues that (I am paraphrasing broadly here) a \nConvention right like Article 8 enshrines all existing Hohfeldian liberties\u2014things I am \nfree to do because the law has not removed the liberty to do them\u2014that come within the \nordinary meaning of the right to privacy, family life, and so forth.  Thus if I enjoy the \nHohfeldian liberty to choose to watch particular television programmes at home with my \nson, and that liberty is part of the ordinary understanding of my privacy and my family \nlife, then it would attract prima facie protection of Article 8.44  In this conception, Article \n8(2) would be the real battleground in most cases, and in the case of my son and the \n                                                 \n43 Pedain, n 8 above, 187-192, 195-196. \n44 I do not claim that Pedain would agree with this example, but Pedain does contend that the prima facie \nreach of many Convention articles is drawn too narrowly and that, at least in the Pretty case, the House of \nLords should have found Article 8 engaged, and focused its decision more on the justification exceptions.  \ntelevision programmes, the state would need to make a (fairly minimal) showing of \nlegitimate objective and proportionality to justify taking the programmes away.  Were the \ncourts to adopt this very sensitive understanding of the prima facie scope of Article 8 and \nother Convention rights, I would not object to drawing the boundaries of \u2018enjoyment of \nthe Article 8 right\u2019 coterminously with the prima facie scope of that right.  \nThere are, however, two problems with this.  First, the prima facie scope of \nArticle 8\u2014as well as that of other articles\u2014has not been drawn so sensitively by courts.  \nFor example, in (R) Pretty v DPP the House of Lords clearly saw the Article 8(1) \nanalysis as calling upon them to distinguish, on the one hand, a core of privacy on which \nthe state must justify placing burdens from, on the other hand, activities that people just \nhappen to be allowed to engage in privately.45  Many courts have noted that the \nestablished prima facie scope of Article 8 falls short of what they concede must be the \nmore extensive \u2018ambit\u2019 of Article 8.46  Thus some definition of the area of \u2018enjoyment of \na Convention right\u2019 must be sought beyond the prima facie scope of the right in question \nas the courts currently interpret it.   \nSecond, adopting the prima facie scope of a right as its ambit does not deal with \nunqualified rights or rights expressed in a negative way.  For example, the idea that \nArticle 14 could only prevent discrimination in the choices of procedures required to \nsatisfy the protective core of Article 6 was precluded in Belgian Linguistics, where the \nECtHR specifically referred to the example of Article 14 protecting against \n                                                 \n45 Pretty [2002] AC 800, paras 17-26, 61-62, 98-101. \n46 Petrovic (2001) 33 EHRR 14, paras 26-29; Gaygusuz v Austria (1996) 23 EHRR 365, paras 36-41; \nMalekshad v Howard de Walden Estates Ltd [2001] EWCA Civ 761, para 54; R (Hooper) v Secretary for \nWork and Pensions [2002] EWHC 191, paras 14-26; Ghaidan [2004] UKHL 30, para 135. \ndiscrimination in the provision of procedures above and beyond those required by Article \n6.47  Rights expressed negatively, such as the Article 2, Protocol 1 right to education, \nidentify their prima facie protection according to what the state should not do (eg, deny \nthe right to education).  How can this help in understanding when a person can be said to \nbe \u2018enjoying\u2019 that right?  Article 14\u2019s protection of the enjoyment of the right to \neducation without discrimination should not mean that the state may discriminate through \nassistance, but not through obstacles.48    \nDespite the shortcomings of this conception, the UK House of Lords employed it \nin an assisted suicide case, R (Pretty) v DPP.49  The severely disabled claimant alleged \nthat a ban on assisted suicide resulted in violations of, among others, Article 8 alone and \nArticle 14 together with Article 8.  The Lords predictably analysed Article 8 by itself \nbefore reaching Article 14, almost certainly because it allowed them to dispose of the \nArticle 14 claim by referring to their previous determination that the case did not \n\u2018engage\u2019 Article 8.  It appears from the opinions of Lords Steyn, Hope, and Bingham that \nthey concluded that if the facts did not \u2018engage\u2019 Article 8(1)\u2014that is, the Article 8 right \nbefore the application of any of the exceptions found in Article 8(2)\u2014then Article 14 \ncould not apply.50  Lord Hope\u2019s discussion of why Article 8 was not prima facie engaged \ndemonstrates the real danger of this approach.  The claimant, who was physically \n                                                 \n47 (1968) 1 EHRR 252, para 9. \n48 R. Singh, Human Rights in the United Kingdom (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 1999) 51-58; cf Douglas \n[2004] HRLR 14, para 56. \n49 [2002] AC 800. \n50 Pretty [2002] AC 800, paras 34, 35, 64, 104, and 106.  These citations were first brought to my attention \nby Pedain, n 8 above, 196. \nincapable of taking her own life\u2014something she would be allowed to do under UK law if \nshe were able\u2014had argued that a prohibition on assisted suicide violated her right to \nprivacy by effectively making it impossible for her to choose the time and process of her \ndeath, which she deemed a private choice.  Lord Hope addressed this claim as follows: \n \nThe way [the claimant] chooses to pass the closing moments of her life is part of \nthe act of living, and she has a right to ask that this too must be respected.  In that \nrespect [she] has a right to self-determination.  In that sense, her private life is \nengaged even where in the face of a terminal illness she seeks to choose death \nrather than life. . . . it is an entirely different thing to imply into these words [those \nof article 8(1)] a positive obligation to give effect to her wish to end her own life \nby means of assisted suicide.  I think that to do so would be to stretch the meaning \nof those words too far.51 \n \nBy means of the foregoing argument Lord Hope concluded that Article 8 was not \nprima facie engaged, meaning that Article 8(1) did not require that the state bolster a \nperson\u2019s privacy by helping her to commit suicide.  He later relied on this conclusion\u2014\nthat Article 8 was not engaged\u2014to find that the case could not therefore come within the \nambit of the right to privacy for Article 14 purposes.  Yet it is clear from his words that \nhe believed that if the claimant had the physical capacity to choose suicide unassisted, \nshe would in making that choice be enjoying her Article 8 rights.  Indeed Lord Hope \nwould say that an unassisted person, in making that choice, would prima facie engage \n                                                 \n51 Pretty [2002] AC 800, para 100. \narticle 8(1), in that the state would need to invoke an Article 8(2) exception to interfere \nwith that choice.  However, he drew the limit of Article 8(1)\u2019s protective scope such that \nit would forbid the state to interfere with unassisted suicide, but would not require it to \nallow assisted suicide.   \nThis kind of reasoning cannot form the basis for a sound decision as to the \napplicability of Article 14.  If, as Lord Hope said, in choosing suicide rather than slow, \npainful death an able-bodied person is enjoying the right to privacy, then surely a \ndisabled person making the same choice, if allowed to do so with assistance, would also \nbe enjoying that right.  Article 14 prohibits a state measure that prevents one person from \nmaking that choice on a basis of equality with other members of society, unless the \nmeasure satisfies a justification inquiry.  Article 14 is therefore clearly engaged according \nto Lord Hope\u2019s analysis, yet he found that it was not because he had found that Article 8 \nwas not.  Article 8(1) was not engaged because Article 8(1) alone could not require the \nstate to help people take their own lives\u2014at least a defensible position where no unequal \ntreatment is involved.  Yet if others are enjoying their right of privacy in choosing \nsuicide, then the disabled would be enjoying the same right if they were allowed to make \nthat choice.  Article 14 requires that the state justify a prohibition which denies that \nchoice to the disabled alone.52   \nA similar error is illustrated in R(Marper) v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire \nPolice, where the court found that article 8(1) was not engaged by the taking and keeping \n                                                 \n52 See, eg, Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, paras 39-45 (requiring an exception, for convictions based on \nreligion, to a prohibition on persons with serious criminal convictions receiving appointments as chartered \naccountants).   \nof DNA samples and fingerprints, because despite more privacy-protective cultural \ntraditions in the UK than in other ECHR signatory nations, the protective scope of article \n8(1) must be restricted to the \u2018floor\u2019 of protection prescribed by the Strasbourg \njurisprudence.53  Lord Steyn then observed, \u2018If my conclusion is right that article 8(1) is \nnot engaged, it follows that article 14 is not triggered.\u2019  This of course meant that the \ncourt never asked whether the logic that required limiting the protective scope of Article \n8(1) to a lowest common denominator \u2018floor\u2019 had any appropriate application to the \nquestion of whether selectively keeping DNA and fingerprint information unequally \nburdened the enjoyment of privacy as between people or groups in the UK. \nThe Article 8 engagement analysis does not smoothly transfer to the Article 14 \nanalysis, because Article 8(1) asks what\u2014assuming no inequality is present\u2014the state \ncould be called upon to provide to all people by way of privacy.  On the other hand, \nArticle 14 seeks to prevent discrimination with regard to, among other things, what \nprivacy most people enjoy in a society protected by Article 8.  It asks, in essence, what \nprotections the state must provide to the few to keep their enjoyment of rights in line with \nthat of the many, a question that cannot satisfactorily be answered by whether or not \nArticle 8(1) alone is engaged.  Ultimately, the mistake in Pretty and Marper was the \nLords\u2019 unwillingness to interpret and apply Article 14 as a guarantee in its own right, \ninstead of as a mere exception to the exceptions built into Article 8. \n \n \n                                                 \n53 [2004] UKHL 39, paras 27, 31, 44. \nAGAINST CONCEPTION (2): STATE AIMS SHOULD WEIGH \nONLY PROPORTIONALLY \n \nThe second conception essentially amounts to a requirement that the state must have \nintended to enter into the ambit in order to be found to have done so.  This conception \ndraws some legitimacy from the argument that, at least with regard to primary legislation, \nParliament has a role in deciding the content of ECHR rights in the UK.54  However, it \ndoes not follow from this that the only way Convention rights can be enjoyed outside the \nprotective scope of Convention articles is for Parliament to exercise its prerogative to \nprotect those rights beyond what is strictly required by the ECHR.  If this were so, the \nstate could avoid scrutiny under Article 14 simply by basing all legislation on objectives \nconceived and expressed in terms unconnected with human rights.  Such a view would \nlead courts to reject, on ambit grounds, any complaint about measures directed at, for \nexample, resource allocation or health and safety, regardless of their human rights \nimpact.55  To claim that the state can be called to account for discriminating in the \nenjoyment of Convention rights only when it intends its actions to affect human rights is \nlike saying that I cannot be required to compensate the pedestrian I knocked down with \nmy car because I did not operate my car for the purpose of interacting with pedestrians, \nbut to get from one place to another. \nSuch an approach is worse than imprudent: it allows the state to cheat the Article \n14 analysis.  Reliance on this kind of regulatory mens rea requirement is misguided and \n                                                 \n54 See, eg, Hiebert, n 14 above. \n55 See, eg, Erskine, [2003] EWHC Admin 2479, para 34. \nproblematic because (1) it uses the ambit analysis to do a job assigned to and perfectly \nwell performed by the justification analysis and (2) this rerouting of functions allows \n\u2018justificatory considerations\u2019 to dispose of cases in favour of the state without satisfying \nthe proportionality balancing required by the Strasbourg jurisprudence on Article 14.  It \nseems obvious that if courts accept, as bearing on an ambit inquiry that does not require a \nproportionality balancing, considerations that are intended to bite only proportionally, \nthey allow the state to circumvent the requirements of proportionality.  A decision that \nthe ambit of Article 8, for example, cannot encompass the use of assistance in taking \none\u2019s own life, if made on the basis that the state cannot reasonably be expected to \nendorse such assistance, has relied on a state aim\u2014that of not endorsing practices \nallegedly inimical to public health and safety\u2014and a state prerogative\u2014that of being \nentitled not to assist people in activities with which it could be required not to interfere\u2014\nin order to dispose of a claim.  It has done so without assessing whether the use of a \nregulatory approach that makes suicide impossible for the severely disabled, but not for \nothers, produces benefits in proportion to the burden placed thereby on the severely \ndisabled.   \nEven if the court\u2014and this is usually not the case\u2014took proportionality into \naccount in deciding the initial question of whether Article 8(1) could reach a ban on \nassisted suicide, it did not subject to a proportionality review the use of a scheme that \ndistinguished on the basis of disability: it merely assessed whether a presumptively non-\ndiscriminatory prohibition on the use of assistance in suicide sufficiently advanced a \nlegitimate state objective.  Article 14, however, asks whether sufficient benefits flow \nfrom the choice to use a discriminatory measure\u2014as opposed to a measure that avoids \nthe discriminatory impacts complained of\u2014to justify the discriminatory effects of that \nchoice.56  Reasonable minds might differ as to whether it serves any legitimate state aim \nat all to, in effect, forbid a tiny, vulnerable minority from choosing a fate that is perfectly \nlegal for the rest of UK society; but no dispute can exist as to the following fact: the \nHouse of Lords in Pretty never weighed the proportionality of discrimination against the \ndisabled when it made its ruling on the Article 14 ambit of Article 8.57     \nThe UK judiciary has nevertheless openly adopted this mens rea requirement in \nseveral cases.  In R (Douglas) v North Tyneside MBC, for example, the court concluded \nthat the ambit of Article 2 of Protocol 1, which guarantees that the right to education \n\u2018shall not be denied,\u2019 was not entered by age-restricted student loans.  This conclusion \nrelied on the observation that the restrictions were not \u2018aimed\u2019 at education, nor did they \n\u2018necessarily\u2019 affect the claimant\u2019s ability to get an education.58  In other words, if the \nstate did not intend to involve itself with education rights, then any impairment \nexperienced by the applicant could not have been in the enjoyment of his right to \neducation.   \nThe only support the court cited for this surreal test came from the ECtHR \nopinion in Petrovic v Austria, where the Strasbourg court, on its way to finding that \ndiscrimination against fathers in the granting of a family leave allowance engaged Article \n14 with Article 8, noted that the allowance \u2018intended to promote family life and \n                                                 \n56 See, eg, Singh, n 11 above, 152. \n57 [2002] AC 800, paras 34-37, 64, 106.   \n58 [2004] HRLR 14, paras 56, 60.  \nnecessarily affects the way in which the latter is organised.\u201959  However, the Court in \nPetrovic never suggested that this was the only way or even the usual way that facts \nmight fall within the ambit of a Convention right.  Other Strasbourg cases, like \nThlimmenos v Greece, make it clear that the facts of a case can engage Article 14 even \nwhere the state, in enacting the impugned measure, had no intention of involving itself in \nthe invoked right, and where the measure would have the effect complained of in only a \nhandful of cases, completely by accident.60  The objectives of the state and the kinds of \nmeasures it enacts are among the facts that can bring a case within the ambit of a \nConvention right.  If the state seeks to promote a certain right, and in so doing \ndiscriminates, a court will properly recite the fact of the state\u2019s intended engagement with \nthe right as evidence that the activities affected by the measure are in the area of \nenjoyment of a Convention right, as the Court in Petrovic did.  That in no way suggests \nthat such an intention on the part of the state, or a direct relationship of necessity between \nthe measure and the burden complained of, amount to ambit prerequisites.   \nThe court in Douglas essentially imported, into the ambit analysis, information \nmore suited to an inquiry into whether a discriminatory measure is \u2018justified\u2019: the state \nmight properly defend a measure that discriminates on the basis of age in the provision of \nstudent loans on the ground that the measure pursues aims independent of education, and \nthat negative impacts of the scheme are both rare and avoidable.  It is the very existence \nof this justification step in the Article 14 analysis that makes it invidious to factor such \n                                                 \n59 [2001] 33 EHRR 14, para 29.  See also Erskine [2003] EWHC Admin 2479, para 34; Morris [2004] \nEWHC 2191, paras 10-15. \n60 Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, paras 39-49. \nconsiderations into the ambit question.  For a court to exclude a case from the ambit of a \nConvention right using justificatory considerations not only pointlessly conflates the \nenjoyment of a right with unrelated government objectives, but it allows the state to make \ngood its defense against discrimination without satisfying proportionality.   \nThis kind of sleight-of-hand occurs in far more subtle ways than Douglas\u2019s \noutright reliance on the state\u2019s intentions.  For example, in two Scottish foxhunting cases, \nWhaley v Lord Advocate61 and Adams v Scottish Ministers62 the courts concluded that a \nban on foxhunting did not enter the ambit of Article 8 because foxhunting was not a \nprivate activity.  However, several complainants in both cases alleged that the ban on \nfoxhunting affected other areas of their lives dependent on foxhunting.  The activities that \nthey claimed the foxhunting ban burdened included the organisation of their home and \nfamily life, and their private choices about their lifestyle and vocations.  Some of the \nclaimants had been hunt managers their entire adult life, and thus claimed they were in \nsituations analogous to dismissal from employment for reasons that burden a private \nlifestyle choice, which has received Article 14 protection.63  The court in each case, \nhowever, would not look at whether the state inadvertently had affected other aspects of \nlife with its ban.  Foxhunting was the activity in question, and foxhunting was not the \nkind of activity protected by Article 8. \n                                                 \n61 [2004] SC 78, paras 63-65, 93. \n62 [2002] SCLR 881, paras 102-103, 136. \n63 Sidabras [2004] ECHR 395, paras 42-50.  For protection of employment by other ECHR articles see \nSmith and Grady v United Kingdom (2000) 29 EHRR 493, 494; Vogt v Germany (1996) 21 EHRR 205, \n206-207. \nAnother example of this phenomenon appears in X v Y, where the judges focused \non whether the reason identified by the employer for its decision to dismiss the claimant \nentered into the ambit, rather than on whether the claimant\u2019s burdened activity fell within \nthe ambit.64  The case involved the question of whether dismissal of an employee for \nreceiving a police citation for engaging in a homosexual act in a public toilet was \ninconsistent with Article 14 taken together with Article 8.  The Court of Appeal held that \nArticle 8 could not possibly extend protection to acts in public places, so the ambit of \nArticle 8 was not entered into by dismissal for such acts.  This ignored the fact, however, \nthat the employee would not have been cited, or dismissed, or even, probably, in a public \ntoilet at all had he not made the private choice to engage in homosexual acts as opposed \nto heterosexual ones.  The question for the court was whether the unfair dismissal laws\u2014\nwhich on their own would have endorsed the employer\u2019s dismissal decision\u2014as applied \nin this case imposed an unequal burden on the claimant\u2019s right to make private choices as \ncompared to heterosexuals.  The claimant\u2019s freedom to make choices as to his sexual \norientation was in fact constrained by the tribunal essentially authorising his dismissal \nunder circumstances where a heterosexual person would not be dismissed.  The court did \nnot, however, consider whether these facts entered into the ambit of Article 8.  Instead, it \ndecided that the relevant facts\u2014the facts that must enter the ambit of Article 8 in order to \nengage Article 14\u2014were the reasons of the employer for dismissing the employee.   \nIt is clear that under the HRA, a court applying a Convention right must ask \nwhether an individual\u2019s right has been burdened, regardless of whether the challenged \nmeasure aimed at that right per se.  Banning foxhunting clearly has effects on activities \n                                                 \n64 [2004] EWCA Civ 662, paras 52, 59. \ninvolving the enjoyment of privacy and family life as ordinarily understood; sacking gay \nemployees for police entanglements that would never happen to heterosexual employees \nclearly imposes unequal consequences on private choices.  That the government or the \nemployer did not intend to affect these activities; that these effects would not materialise \nfor most people; that the challenged action only interfered with some but not all such \nactivities; and that the claimants could avoid some of the negative effects of the \nchallenged action, are all arguments that should have been directed to justification: a \nproper justification analysis would very likely find the foxhunting ban proportionate, and \nmight find the dismissal proportionate.  But that is not what the judges did.  They held \nthat if the challenged action aimed at something that did not engage Article 8 protection, \nArticle 14 could not ward off \u2018collateral damage\u2019 to other protected activities.        \n \nAGAINST CONCEPTION (3): PROTECTIVE SCOPE LOGIC  \nTAINTS THE AMBIT \n \nThe third conception is perhaps the most common.  It is adopted by courts and \ncommentators who acknowledge that Strasbourg precedent requires an ambit that extends \nbeyond the prima facie reach of other articles, but who cannot avoid the fundamental \nmistake of the first conception\u2014that of treating Article 14 as a gloss on other articles \ninstead of a guarantee in its own right.  Courts commonly address claims under Article \n14\u2014coupled, of course, with another non-parasitic \u2018substantive\u2019 article\u2014by deriving the \nambit of the substantive right from an antecedent interpretation of that article\u2019s protective \nreach.  Domestic judges typically ask first whether the challenged measure offends the \nsubstantive article, and only if it does not do they move to consider the Article 14 claim.  \nThis method leads the courts astray because they nearly always take the thinking \ninvolved in deciding whether, for instance, Article 8 forbids the state to take a certain \naction, and apply that thinking to the question of whether the action affected the \nclaimant\u2019s enjoyment of the right set out in Article 8.   \nI have already argued that the protective core of a Convention right is derivative \nof the area of its enjoyment, and that therefore the boundaries of that protective core can \nshed no light on where courts should draw the boundaries of the ambit.  The fact that \nprotective scope logic cannot really help identify when a person can be said to be \n\u2018enjoying\u2019 Convention rights is reason enough not to use it.  However, there is an \naffirmative reason for working to keep protective scope thinking out of the ambit \nanalysis: it inappropriately focuses the inquiry on the state.  The process of delineating \nprotective scope involves identifying those parts of privacy, for example, with regard to \nwhich one should expect to be free from government intrusion, or where one should not \nexpect assistance from the state.  This inquiry necessarily allows privacy to be defined\u2014\nfor protective purposes only\u2014according to, for example, what the government intends to \ndo with fingerprints it lawfully collects,65 or what kind of support for autonomy the \ngovernment might legitimately be expected to provide to those unable to act \nautonomously.66  Fleshing out the ambit on this basis cannot give effect to a separate idea \nof enjoyment of a Convention right. \n                                                 \n65 Marper [2004] UKHL 39, paras 28-31. \n66 Pretty [2002] AC 800, para 100. \nFor example, in Home Secretary v Hindawi Kennedy LJ and Sedley LJ of the \nCourt of Appeal both, in different ways, found that Article 5\u2019s protective scope controlled \nthe question of whether an alien prisoner\u2019s attempts to enjoy the procedures of an early \nrelease programme on a basis of equality with British nationals fell within the scope of \nArticle 14.67  Kennedy LJ linked the decision on whether the facts fell within the area of \nenjoyment of a Convention right to the original sentencing decision: so long as their \nsentences remained lawful, the prisoners had no Article 5 rights whatsoever, and \ntherefore could not suffer discrimination in the enjoyment of any such rights.  Kennedy \nLJ acknowledged that the ambit went beyond the area of Article 5\u2019s protection, and did \nnot openly adopt the \u2018prima facie engagement\u2019 conception, but he determined the scope \nof the ambit without reference to the prisoners\u2019 experience of liberty and the burdens \nplaced on it.  He concluded that because Article 5 would authorise the state, during the \nperiod of their sentences, to deprive the claimants of any liberty at all, then those crumbs \nof liberty the state happened to let fall to prisoners were ex gratia (my words), and could \nnot constitute enjoyment of liberty in the Article 5 sense.   \nSedley LJ more subtly avoided the implications of Article 14, and of the meaning \nof \u2018enjoyment of the right to liberty set out in Article 5,\u2019 by relying on the state\u2019s choice \nof procedural mechanisms.  The prisoners complained of the discriminatory denial of \nparole board involvement in their release decisions.  Sedley LJ concluded that because \nthe prisoners sought what he called a mere \u2018Hohfeldian\u2019 right to a process, one that would \nnot necessarily improve their chances of regaining the protections of Article 5 enjoyed by \n                                                 \n67 [2004] EWCA Civ 1309, paras 9-22, 35-41. \nnon-prisoners, they could not be said to be enjoying a Convention right.68  Because the \nprocedure they craved might not bring them any closer to the fully protected liberty they \nwould enjoy if they received early release, it was not necessarily linked to the area \ndirectly protected by Article 5, and fell outside the ambit.  Neither Sedley LJ nor \nKennedy LJ explored the possibility that there can exist a residuum of the liberty \u2018set \nforth\u2019 in Article 5 even where Article 5 cannot\u2014in the performance of its function as a \nguarantor against state invasions of liberty\u2014afford direct protection.  A proper analysis \nwould have (1) identified the ambit as the area of enjoyment of the right to liberty\u2014as \n\u2018set forth\u2019 by Article 5, not as directly protected by it\u2014(2) found that the distinctions at \nissue burdened the claimants\u2019 equal enjoyment of what little liberty they retained\u2014or \nburdened their equal enjoyment of what limited avenues to liberty remained to other \npersons in similar circumstances\u2014and (3) weighed the lawfulness and extent of their \nexisting sentences, and the limited and speculative impact on their future liberty of the \nprocedure they sought, against the claimants in a justification analysis. \n \n \nA NEW CONCEPTION: THE \u2018ENJOYMENT\u2019 OF CONVENTION RIGHTS \n \nThe conception that I support in this article defines the ambit as the area in which a \nperson is enjoying a right set out in the Convention, according to the ordinary \nunderstanding of the right in the relevant society. This formulation expresses what \nBuxton, LJ appeared to be getting at in Ghaidan v Godin-Mendoza, in the Court of \n                                                 \n68 ibid paras 38-41. \nAppeal, when he identified the ambit of Article 8 with \u2018factual areas characteristic of \nthose protected by Article 8.\u201969  This view of the ambit essentially describes a society\u2019s \n\u2018Hofeldian liberties\u2019 with regard to the relevant Convention right.  It resembles what \nAntje Pedain argues should be\u2014but has not been treated by the courts as\u2014the prima \nfacie protective scope of Convention rights like Articles 8 through 11.70  According to \nthis conception, the ambit encompasses those activities in which the state has opted to \nallow the majority to engage, even where it could choose not to allow the activities under \nthe ECHR; it also includes any entitlement, benefit, privilege or other social good that the \nstate introduces, subsidizes, or protects in an effort to promote a \u2018right\u2019 set out in the \nConvention.  Thus if the state chooses to protect my email correspondence from \ninterference in the interests of enhancing the privacy I enjoy, then it must do so in a non-\ndiscriminatory fashion regardless of the fact that under the protective scope of Article 8 it \ncould not only refrain from offering the protection, but could directly invade this tenuous \nkind of privacy if it chose.71  If the state permits and supports a state of affairs where my \njob or career can enable me to develop relationships and earn money to support private \nlife, my existing job is part of my enjoyment of private life, even though Article 8 could \nnot require the state to provide me with such a job, or prohibit it from taking my job \nthrough a non-discriminatory measure.72  Such a conception is completely consistent \n                                                 \n69 [2002] EWCA Civ 1533, para 12. \n70 Pedain, note 8 above, 185-187. \n71 See, eg, Thlimmenos [2000] ECHR 162, paras 43-45; Petrovich (1998) 33 EHRR 14, paras 26-29; \nGaygusus (1997) 23 EHRR 364, paras 36-41; Belgian Linguistics (1968) 1 EHRR 252, 283. \n72 Sidabras [2004] ECHR 395, paras 42-50. \nwith the often vague Strasbourg teaching on the ambit, and no ECtHR authority supports \nthe focus on state aims or protective scope thinking so tempting to some UK judges. \n                                                \nThis new conception has never been adopted in the precise terms I advocate, yet \nthere are cases that exemplify its application, Thlimmenos being a notable example.  \nSome elements of the judiciary, both in the UK and Strasbourg, grasp how Article 14 \nshould work, and have made it do so, without waiting for a clear formulation to emerge.  \nFor example, the other judge on the panel in Hindawi, Neuberger LJ, disagreed with the \nmajority, arguing that the very nature of liberty as a right suggested that people trying to \nsecure their liberty must be seen as either enjoying or trying to enjoy their rights under \nArticle 5, regardless of whether the claimants actually enjoyed any protection, prima \nfacie or otherwise, from Article 5 at the time.73  He relied in part on the conclusion of the \nunanimous Court of Appeal panel in the highly analogous case of R (Clift) v Home \nSecretary that the absence of any protective engagement of Article 5 could not preclude \nan Article 14 claim regarding the ordinary liberty represented by early release \nprocedures.74   Lord Justice Buxton in Ghaidan at the Court of Appeal went so far as to \nidentify the ambit with ordinary factual situations \u2018characteristic\u2019 of the core of rights \ndirectly protected by Convention articles, even if the their link with the core was of the \n\u2018most tenuous\u2019 kind.75 \nSeveral ECtHR decisions are simultaneously consistent with the new conception \nand inconsistent with the three conceptions more popular with UK judges.  For example, \n \n73 Hindawi [2004] EWCA Civ 1309, paras 57-83 (Neuberger, LJ). \n74 [2004] EWCA Civ 514, paras 14-18.  \n75 [2002] EWCA Civ 1533, para 9. \nin Sidabras and Dziautas v Lithuania the Court concluded that a ban on admission to \ncivil service positions, imposed on the basis of former membership in the KGB, entered \ninto the ambit of Article 8\u2019s protection of \u2018private life.\u201976  There was no suggestion that \nthe state sought to regulate private life, and it was well established that the prima facie \nscope of Article 8(1) alone did not protect the choice of a particular profession, and could \nnot even require the state to offer a justification for the politically-motivated ban.  \nHowever, Article 14 changed the analysis, focusing it on the fact that the ban impaired \nthe ability of people with a particular political background to enjoy the social benefits \nassociated with a given career on a basis of equality with other people.  The Court did not \ndraw the ambit according to the aims of the state or the protective scope of Article 8, but \naccording to what it means to enjoy, or suffer a burden on the enjoyment of, the ordinary \nright to organise one\u2019s private and social life as one sees fit.77  \nSuch a broad conception of the ambit must of course avoid allowing the \nrelationship with other Convention rights to be so tenuous that Article 14 would become \nindistinguishable from, for example, Protocol 12.  As long as there is some principle for \nlimiting the ambit, however, Article 14 is in no danger of obviating Protocol 12 because \nmany activities affected by state action clearly do not have even a tenuous link to \nConvention rights.78  Moreover, it would border on the perverse to argue that courts \nshould not give Article 14 a robust interpretation\u2014one consistent with its express \nterms\u2014simply because it might make the legal community less desperate to bring \n                                                 \n76 [2004] ECHR 395, paras 42-50. \n77 [2004] ECHR 395, para 50. \n78 Livingstone, n 5 above, 28. \nProtocol 12 into effect.  Similarly, a broad ambit, that would permit more complaints to \nsatisfy the ambit inquiry, should not fall to a \u2018floodgates\u2019 objection because, as I argued \nabove, the justification analysis is the appropriate mechanism for separating lawful and \nunlawful government distinctions.  The bench and bar might find the ambit a more \nconvenient tool for weeding out weak cases, in that they can more easily cast it as a \npurely legal\u2014as opposed to factual\u2014determination, but such a consideration cannot \njustify using a conception of the ambit that weeds out the strong cases along with the \nweak. \n Any conception a court adopts for the scope of Article 14 requires deciding issues \nsuch as whether privacy encompasses the choice to die,79 or whether sexual choices are \nprivate when implemented in public places.80  Drawing lines is difficult, and the only \nconceptions that might make this job easier\u2014requiring regulatory mens rea or identifying \nthe ambit with the prima facie scope of other articles\u2014are demonstrably wrong and \ndistorting.  There might, however, exist an approach that would keep the ambit broad, but \nless impressionistic.  It has been suggested, for example, that the ambit \u2018is not simply a \ncase of \u201cyou will know it when you see it,\u201d but that in fact the sort of subject matter that \nwe are dealing with is also informed by other international instruments.\u201981  This facially \nappealing idea, that the ambit of, for example, privacy can be tied to an internationally \naccepted set of principles about what people mean by privacy in a human rights context, \n                                                 \n79 Pretty [2002] AC 800, para 100. \n80 X v Y [2004] EWCA Civ 662, para 52. \n81 This statement was made by a member of the bar at a seminar, put on as a part of the Durham Human \nRights Centre\u2019s project on Judicial Reasoning and the Human Rights Act, at the offices of Allen and Overy \nin London on 18 February 2005.  A transcript of the proceedings is available from the author upon request. \nunfortunately begs the question of whether Article 14 seeks to prevent discrimination \nonly in an area defined by an international consensus on privacy or other Convention \nrights.   \nIn one sense, there already exists an authoritative international consensus on \nprivacy, relevant to the states signatory to the ECHR, represented by Article 8 and the \nbody of precedent related to its application.  As I have argued, the protective scope of \nArticle 8 cannot flesh out the privacy ambit because it is a subset of that ambit.  In every \nECHR state the experience of privacy is likely to be at its most idiosyncratic above the \nline of Article 8\u2019s protective scope.  It is here that cultural identity will find expression; it \nis here that one nation might more assiduously scrutinise, for example, the sexual \norientation of putative adoptive parents82 or the use of fingerprint or DNA records.83  It is \nprecisely in this area, where the ECtHR refuses to claim that a consensus exists, that \nArticle 14 must prevent the enjoyment of rights from being secured more zealously for \nsome than for others.  Article 14 serves its most important function where the majority\u2014\nthe authors of any view of a right that would be characteristic of a particular nation\u2014\narranges things, in the area above direct protection from other Convention rights, in such \na way that the greatest enjoyment of the right comes from integration, assimilation, or \nsimple agreement with the majority.   \nIt is difficult to imagine a set of international principles that would assist a UK \ncourt with the question of whether, for example, access to student loans for university \nstudy is part of the enjoyment of the right to education in the UK.  Where the Strasbourg \n                                                 \n82 Frette v France [2002] ECHR 156, paras 40-42. \n83 Marper [2004] UKHL 39, paras 25-27. \njurisprudence applying Article 2 of Protocol 1 can only tell the court that the ECHR does \nnot require the provision of such loans, no international instruments, including the \nConvention, can inform the court as to whether people in the UK consider generally \navailable student loans to be part of their enjoyment of the freedom of education.  If \nArticle 14 is to prevent the UK government from, say, systematically making the right to \neducation easier to enjoy for people under 35 than for people 35 and over, it must apply \nto situations that no international consensus\u2014for there can be none with regard to the \nplace of university loans in the UK conception of educational freedom\u2014can possibly \nilluminate.  The HRA authorises and indeed encourages the UK judiciary to develop a \ndomestic understanding of Convention rights, and nothing in Strasbourg jurisprudence \nprevents the UK from providing more protection under Article 14 than the ECtHR would \nitself require.84  \n It is necessary, therefore, that UK judges face up to a task that Ronald Dworkin \nwould call Herculean: they must interpret the traditions, attitudes, and laws of their own \ncommunity to arrive at an idea of what it means to enjoy a given right in UK society.85  \nJudges must not shrink from this task in favour of shortcuts, especially those that cannot \nmake their decisions any less impressionistic and will assure that Article 14 lives up to its \nparasitic reputation.  They should approach the question of whether Article 14 is engaged \nwithout reference to (1) the aims, logic, or nature of the impugned state action or (2) \n                                                 \n84 R.

Instead, the language and logic of Article 14 call for an \nopen textured consideration of whether the claimant\u2019s enjoyment of a Convention right or \nfreedom on a basis of equality with other members of society has been impaired by a \nstate measure or decision, where the court must presume that the area of enjoyment of the \nright in question extends well beyond the protection of the specific Convention article \ninvolved, but not beyond an ordinary understanding of the scope of that right in the \nrelevant society. \n"}
