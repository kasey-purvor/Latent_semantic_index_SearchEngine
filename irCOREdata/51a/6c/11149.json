We propose that\nnegative ion chemistry plays a role in the heater-induced\nmodulation of the PMWEs. In the mesosphere, an increased\nelectron temperature leads to a higher rate of electron to\nneutral attachment, and therefore to a decreased electron\ndensity. To a first-order approximation, scattering from\nBragg-scale gradients caused by turbulence can be\nconsidered to be proportional to the electron density\nsquared. Under this assumption, the electron density\nvariation calculated by the detailed Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion\nChemistry model (SIC) predicts correctly both the\nmagnitude and the timescale of the modulation observed\nwith the EISCAT VHF radar.

Lett., 35, L23102, doi:10.1029\/\n2008GL035798.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Coherent radar echoes from the mesosphere on both\nsummer and winter periods have become a familiar feature\nin radar data across a range of latitudes and operating\nfrequencies [e.g., Woodman and Guillen, 1974; Czechowsky\net al., 1979; Ecklund and Balsley, 1981; Karashtin et al.,\n1997; Ro\u00a8ttger et al., 1988, 1990]. Over the years much\neffort has gone into understanding the underlying cause of\nthe so-called polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE)\n[Rapp and Lu\u00a8bken, 2004], including direct stimulation of\nthe ionosphere with powerful high frequency (HF) heaters\n[e.g., Chilson et al., 2000; Belova et al., 2003]. Results of\ndedicated active experiments [Havnes et al., 2003] have\nconfirmed the established premise that PMSE relies on the\nexistence of charged aerosol particles in the cold summer\nmesosphere [von Zahn and Bremer, 1999; Lu\u00a8bken et al.,\n2002; Havnes et al., 1996]. Careful modeling of the electron\ntemperature dependent charging of the aerosols explains the\nvariation in PMSE power during the heating experiments\n[e.g., Havnes, 2004].\n[3] As mentioned, strong radar returns from the meso-\nsphere are not confined to the polar latitudes. Therefore, the\ncommonly used concept of polar mesosphere winter echoes\n(PMWE) is actually a misnomer [e.g., Woodman and\nGuillen, 1974]. In the high latitudes, PMWE were first\nobserved in the 1980s in Alaska [Ecklund and Balsley,\n1981; Balsley et al., 1983] and Norway [Czechowsky et al.,\n1989]. In each case the mechanism for generating the scatter\nwas determined to be turbulence from breaking gravity\nwaves. PMWE occur at a lower altitude than PMSE (50\nto 80 km) [Kirkwood et al., 2002] and against a background\nof elevated electron density such as during solar proton\nevents [e.g., Collis et al., 1992].\n[4] Measurements with lidar and radar [Stebel et al.,\n2004] have raised questions over the assumption that\naerosol particles in the winter hemisphere are too small\nand too few to influence the radar echoes. As a result for an\nextensive rocket campaign, Lu\u00a8bken et al. [2006] concluded\nthat characteristics of PMWE can be fully explained by the\nturbulence alone, without aerosols involved. On the other\nhand, recent rocket and radar observations show clear\nevidence for nanometer scale particles throughout the polar\nwinter mesosphere [Strelnikova et al., 2007; Rapp et al.,\n2008] and hence, the possible role of these particles in the\nPMWE formation should be reconsidered.\n[5] Moreover, a competing explanation over the cause of\nPMWE has been proposed by Kirkwood et al. [2006].\nAccording to this idea, here referred as viscosity wave\ntheory, the PMWE is caused by scattering from evanescent\nion-acoustic waves, i.e., viscosity waves, which are gener-\nated by partial reflection of infrasonic waves. Kirkwood\n[2007] presents two observational contradictions to the\ntraditional turbulence theory, which could be qualitatively\nexplained by the viscosity wave theory. Firstly, a detailed\nanalysis of ESRAD 52 MHz interferometric radar data has\nshown horizontal velocities of a few hundred meters per\nsecond within the PMWE [Kirkwood et al., 2006].\nSecondly, by using a typical PMWE observation by the\nEISCAT VHF radar, Kirkwood [2007] demonstrates that the\nwidth of the backscattered spectrum inside the PMWE is\nequal to the values above and below the layer.\n[6] The latter argument has been recently questioned by\ninvestigating directly the measured autocorrelation function\n(ACF), instead of spectra determined as its Fourier trans-\nformation. By using the spectral characterization method by\nJackel [2000], based on a fitting of a generalized exponen-\ntial function into the detected ACF, Lu\u00a8bken et al. [2007]\nshow that the spectral shape of the PMWE is, in their case,\nclose to Gaussian and the spectrum above the echo is of\nLorentzian shape. This supports strongly the turbulence\ninterpretation of the PMWE.\n[7] Since HF heating of the ionosphere has proved to be\nan important diagnostic technique for PMSE, it has recently\nbeen applied to PMWE as well.

[2000] for\nPMSE. Epoch analysis of a short period heating cycle\n(10 seconds on and off) showed evidence of a recovery in\nthe PMWE during heater-on. In PMSE experiments this was\ntaken as evidence for the presence of charged aerosols\n[Havnes et al., 2003]; however the experiment performed\nby Kavanagh et al. [2006] was not optimized for determin-\ning this. Belova et al. [2008] attempted to repeat the\nexperiment of Havnes et al. [2003] for PMWE. They\nconcluded that a so-called overshoot effect, i.e., a sudden\nincrease of the echo power above the original level after the\nheater was turned off, was present, perhaps indicating the\npresence of very small dust particles. However, they ac-\nknowledged the need for better statistics before drawing\nfirm conclusions.\n[8] In this paper we present one EISCAT VHF incoherent\nscatter radar (224 MHz) observation of PMWE modulation\ninduced by the EISCAT Heating facility. We interpret the\ncharacteristics of the data in terms of mesospheric ion\nchemistry using the Sodankyla\u00a8 Ion Chemistry (SIC) model.\nWe suggest an electron temperature dependent negative ion\nproduction as a possible mechanism participating to the\nheating-induced PMWE modulation.\n2. Data\n[9] In November 2006, a set of EISCAT heating experi-\nments were carried out dedicated to detect the D-region\nheating effect by using newly designed methods for the\nVHF radar [Kero et al., 2008]. In this study we focus on the\nfirst of the six data examples (Figure 1a). In this particular\ncase, the overall heating signature in the incoherent scatter,\nabove the altitudes of a strong PMWE, was the weakest of\nall 6 data examples. In contrast, the backscattered power\nfrom the PMWE modulated clearly along the heating cycle\n(Figure 1c). In order to characterize the origin of the\nbackscatter in different heights, we adopted the method\npresented by Jackel [2000]. A generalized exponential\nfunction of form a(t) = A exp (iBt\u0001(Ct)n) was fitted to\nthe detected ACF by using A, B, C and n as free parameters.\nIn particular, at the altitude of the PMWE, the n-parameter\nwas found to be close to 2 (n = 1.91 \u00b1 0.09), which indicates\na Gaussian spectral shape. This confirms the result by\nLu\u00a8bken et al. [2007] indicating that the PMWE is caused\nby scattering from turbulence. Above the PMWE, the\nn-parameter decays close to unity (n = 1.06 \u00b1 0.08 at 80 km),\nwhich corresponds to Lorentzian shaped spectrum of inco-\nherent scattering. In fact, the n-parameter stays consistently\nabove 1 throughout the D-region altitudes, which according\nto diagnostics proposed by Rapp et al. [2007], may indicate\nan absence of dust particles in our case.\n[10] The super-imposed epoch analysis (SEA) shown in\nFigure 2 reveals the characteristic PMWE response to the\nHF heating. In this approach, the PMWE power was divided\nin super-imposed sequences according to the 6 second on\/\noff heating cycles. In order to obtain the relative PMWE\npower change during the cycles, each sequence was nor-\nmalized by the PMWE power corresponding to the end of\nthe current and previous cycle (mean value of the first and\nthe last column in Figure 2). Distributions of the SEA\nFigure 1. (a) Backscattered power detected by the\nEISCAT VHF radar 24 November 2006.

L23102\n2 of 4\nestimates along the heating cycle are illustrated in Figure 2 as\nvertical gray scale histograms. In addition, error bars show\nthe limits of 50% centermost points in the distributions.\n[11] The analysis shows that the PMWE strength is\nreduced approximately to half the background level after\nthe heater is turned on, and when turned off, the echo power\nrecovers to the original level. Both these transitions take\napproximately two seconds, which are several orders of\nmagnitude longer timescales than typical transition times in\nthe PMSE modulation [Belova et al., 2003]. Moreover,\nneither an overshoot effect after the heater is turned off,\nnor a recovery during the heater-on period was found in the\nanalysis. The absence of these characteristics, typically\nassociated with the PMSE modulation, may be due to the\n6 seconds on\/off modulation used in the experiment being\ntoo fast. The chosen modulation provides, however, a\nrelatively good statistical sample of SEA estimates, and\ntherefore reveals clearly the characteristics of the PMWE\nmodulation.\n3. Model\n[12] The electron density response to the HF heating was\nparameterized by Kero et al. [2008] by using the Sodankyla\u00a8\nIon Chemistry model (SIC) [Verronen, 2006] extended\nversion 7.2 which solves the concentrations of 36 positive\nions, 29 negative ions and 15 minor neutrals via 339\nreactions [Enell et al., 2005]. It should be noted that the\nnegative ion chemistry of the SIC 7.2 is updated to include a\nrevision according to Kazil et al. [2003]. Before the param-\netrization of the chemistry response to the heating, the\nmodel was preconditioned to reproduce the EISCAT VHF\nbackground power profile (see Figure 1b) by introducing\nsolar radiation [Tobiska et al., 2000] and an adjusted\nelectron precipitation as ionization sources.\n[13] Here, the chemical response to the 6 second on\/off\nheating at the PMWE altitude is studied for the electron\ntemperatures Te increased during the heater-on periods by\na factor of 5, 10 and 30 above the neutral temperature Tn\nof 240 K (MSISE-90 model) [Hedin, 1991]. The SIC\nmodel predicts that the electron temperature increase leads\nto a higher electron attachment rate, i.e., production of\nnegative ions, and therefore to a loss of free electrons\n(see Figure 1d). The electron density reduction reaches its\nsaturation point during the heater-on period, and recovers\nto the background state during the off period, in time-\nscales of few seconds.\n[14] Table 1 lists the most important reactions responsible\nfor the electron density modulation. The primary negative\nion O2\n\u0001 is produced via the electron temperature dependent\nattachment process (a). The following reactions in the chain\n(b, c and d) transfer O2\n\u0001 ions effectively into CO4\n\u0001 and CO3\n\u0001.\nIn the end of the heating period only 32 percent of the\nelectron density decrease is due to O2\n\u0001, while CO4\n\u0001 and CO3\n\u0001\ncorrespond to 22 and 46 percents respectively. The loss\nreaction chain (e and f) leads to saturation during the heater-\non period, and recovery when the heater is turned off. Under\nthe assumption that the backscattered power from the\nPMWE is proportional to the electron density squared\n[Lu\u00a8bken et al., 2006], the modeled response, i.e., the relative\nchange of Ne\n2, can be compared to the observed PMWE\nmodulation. In Figure 2, the modeled curves correspond to\nthe heating factors of 5, 10 and 30.\n4. Discussion\n[15] Figure 2 shows that the electron temperature depen-\ndent negative ion chemistry offers a potential explanation\nfor the HF heating induced PMWE modulation with rea-\nsonable electron heating factors. Besides the magnitude, the\ntimescale of the modeled PMWE response matches the\nobserved one well. The model predicts only a slightly\nslower PMWE response compared to the median behavior\nof the superimposed PMWE observations. This small dif-\nference, however, can be due to uncertainties in the model\npreconditioning (see Figure 1b) which has an effect on the\ncharacteristic electron density response. Note that the model\nis not re-adjusted to match the data for this particular\napplication. The chemistry parametrization presented in this\npaper is the same as shown by Kero et al. [2008], where the\neffect of the heating dependent chemistry on the incoherent\nscatter spectrum was studied.\n[16] The critical assumption that the PMWE power is\nproportional to the electron density squared, must be\nregarded as a first order approximation of the true turbu-\nlence scattering response to the heating. Appendix A of\nRapp et al. [2008] shows in details the derivation of the\nturbulence scattering cross section for stationary conditions,\nwhere the production of small scale gradients by turbulence\nis balanced by the diffusion. A challenge for the work in\nfuture would be to develop a time-dependent model de-\nscribing the turbulence scattering in non-stationary condi-\ntions, where the electron temperature changes both the\nchemistry and the diffusion of the plasma. Moreover, the\nchemistry scheme should be upgraded to include the re-\ncently observed charged dust particles in order to quantify\ntheir contribution to the PMWE modulation.\n5. Conclusions\n[17] The electron temperature dependent negative ion\nchemistry offers a potential explanation for the observed\nPMWE modulation shown in Figure 2, assumed that the\necho power is proportional to the electron density squared.\nThe ion chemistry, which is responsible for most of the\nelectron density changes in the model, follows the reaction\nchain listed in Table 1. Besides the need of further PMWE\nobservations during heating experiments, a non-stationary\ntheory for the turbulence backscattering should be devel-\noped for more realistic diagnostics of the heating induced\nPMWE modulation. This work indicates that the D-region\nTable 1. List of the Prominent Reactions Causing the Heating-\nInduced Electron Density Modulation in SIC 7.2a\nReaction Rate Coefficient\na) 2O2+ e !
