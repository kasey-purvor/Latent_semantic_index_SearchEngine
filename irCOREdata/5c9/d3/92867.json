Also seen as less of a problem were vandalism\/graffiti and teenagers hanging around, although perceptions of rubbish or litter were similar to the national picture. Turning next to perceptions of the likelihood of victimisation and worry about crime, we can see that respondents felt the personal threat of crime was less than those 2001 BCS respondents who lived in a rural area. Levels of 1% and 2% for feeling that mugging and physical attack were fairly or very likely during the following 12 months contrasted with 8% in the national picture. Similarly, 7% and 8% of the current sample were fairly or very worried about being mugged and physically attacked  (respectively), compared to 31% and 28% nationally. It should also be noted that a split-ballot was used, with an intensity filter administered to half the sample. In practice, this meant that half the sample was asked whether they had worried about being a victim of a personal Experience and expression: Social and cultural significance in the fear of crime Page 27 crime in the previous year.

It has a number of other names, including LISREL (or linear structural relations\u2014Hayduk, 1987; J\u00f6reskog and S\u00f6rbom, 1988) causal modelling (Bentler, 1980; Reichardt and Gollob, 1986), latent variable models (Everitt, 1984), covariance structure analysis and analysis of covariance structures. At its most general, this is a linear statistical modelling technique, with confirmatory factor analysis, path analysis and regression all representing special cases of SEM. SEM allows the estimation of latent constructs that are measured by imperfect indicators (measurement models) and sets of paths between constructs (structural models). Models can then be tested that conceptualise how these variables (indicators and latent variables) co-vary or relate to one another in various ways. Each model implies a structure of the covariance matrix of the measures\u2014the resulting model-implicated covariance matrix is then compared to the data-based covariance matrix. If the two matrices are consistent with one another then the covariance structure model can be considered a plausible explanation for relations between the measures. SEM should therefore be treated as a largely confirmatory rather than exploratory technique. viii Using AMOS 4.0, a model was tested that specified these five latent constructs, freeing the parameters so the variables covaried. Unsurprisingly considering the lack of structural restraints, the fit of the model was good using the approximate fit indices (\u03c7 2 546.952, 67 df, \u03c1<.001, RMSEA .084, CFI .984) viii. Table 4 provides the parameter estimates of the covariances. All were statistically significant. Physical incivility was highly and positively related to collective efficacy (r=.655) and moderately to informal social control (r=.448) and trust and predictability (r=.491). Social incivility was moderately related to informal social control (r=.401), collective efficacy (r=.405) and trust and predictability (r=.384). ix One new variable was created for each construct, consisting of the saved factor scores using the regression method and MLE Factor Analysis in SPSS 11.0. x For example: physical incivility and perceptions of the trust, predictability and value similarity of local people. With low authoritarianism and concern about social change, the correlations were r=.384 and r=.374 respectively. For those in the middle category, the correlations were r=.456 and r=.452; the final set were r=.582 and r=.591. In other words, incivility and aspects of the social environment became more and more representationally linked as respondents became more concerned about these broader social issues.","cites":null},{"id":17335536,"title":"Vulnerability: Towards a Better Understanding of a Key Variable in","authors":[],"date":"1990","doi":null,"raw":"Killias, M, (1990), \u2018Vulnerability: Towards a Better Understanding of a Key Variable in the Genesis of Fear of Crime\u2019, Violence and Victims, 5\/2: 97-108.","cites":null},{"id":17335541,"title":"What is a \u201cValue-Expressive\u201d Attitude?\u2019","authors":[],"date":"2000","doi":null,"raw":"Maio, G.
