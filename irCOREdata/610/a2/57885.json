For engineering geologists, the historical acquisition of geological data \nin various forms is on the verge of delivering a whole range of new products that \nshould alter the way in which site investigation is carried out.  \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe importance of geology to civil (and, indeed, military) engineering has long been \nrecognised (Fookes, De Freitas and Culshaw 2005; West and Rose 2005). In the \nUnited Kingdom (UK) William Smith, who in 1799 produced a geological map (of \nBath) that is recognisable as such to 21st century geologists, is often regarded as the \nfather of engineering geology because he demonstrated the value of the application \nof geology to mining, canal building and land drainage. In the late 19th century, the \npredecessor of the British Geological Survey (BGS) published a memoir on the soils \nand subsoils ofgreater London that provided non-geologists and geologists, alike, \nwith information on the near-surface ground conditions for building, water supply and \neven the location of cemeteries (Woodward 1897; Culshaw 2004). There were \nrelatively rapid advances in engineering geology in the first half of the 20th century \nbut it was not until after the 2nd World War that engineering geologists and \ngeotechnical engineers began to develop comprehensive standards, classifications \nand codes of working practice for site investigation (see below). However, the value \nof existing information was long recognised and site investigation practitioners were \nencouraged to seek out existing geological information, particularly geological maps.  \n \nAs a result, engineering geologists and geotechnical engineers are both avid users \nand copious providers of information about the shallow subsurface.  Modern working \npractices for site investigation stress the importance of the \u2018desk study\u2019 (Site \nInvestigation Steering Group, 1993), in which existing information about the ground is \naccessed and interpreted to maximise the efficiency of the ground investigation by, \nfor example, optimising the siting of borehole and the locations of geophysical \ntraverse lines. However, accessing the existing information often has been difficult \nbecause the information may be dispersed, relatively inaccessible (geographically), \npoorly catalogued, or all three and, until recently, the information has existed almost \nentirely in analogue form only. The development of computer hardware and software \nthat facilitate both the collection of raw data in digital form and the rapid, accurate \nand economic digitisation of most old analogue records is transforming both the way \nin which information is stored and the ability of data management organisations to \nmake the information available to users. \n \nGeological surveys were set up to both collect new geological information and to \nstore it for future use. For much of their existence, the information was used mostly \nby geologists and other geo-professionals. However, other professionals and the \ngeneral public have shown an interest in accessing geological information, \nparticularly in relation to the potential effect that geological processes may have on \nbuildings. For example, in southern Britain a period of unusually dry weather in the \nperiod 1989-91 caused a large amount of damage to houses founded on shrinkable \nMesozoic and Tertiary clay formations. As a result, geohazard information systems \nwere set up by the BGS, by the successor to the Soil Survey of England and Wales \nand by at least one UK-based insurance company (Culshaw and Kelk 1994; Jones et \nal. 1995). These systems were used by the insurance companies to determine risk \nand set insurance premiums. It is interesting to note that no such systems were set \nup following the previous very dry period in 1976. The last ten years have seen an \nincrease in demand for information on geological, and other, natural hazards in the \nUK. The housing transaction market has mainly generated the demand as solicitors \nwish to demonstrate that the legal searches that they make are comprehensive (and \nhence they avoid potential legal action if a property is subsequently damaged by a \ngeohazard). This increasing demand has been further demonstrated by the \nestablishment and expansion of commercial companies specifically set up to act as \n\u2018warehouses\u2019 for environmental information. The information itself is usually obtained \nfrom public bodies, such as geological surveys, each enquiry generating a small \nfinancial return for the originator of the information. \n \nBecause there are over a million housing transactions every year in Britain, the \ninformation supplied to data warehouses (or \u2018value-added resellers\u2019 as they are also \nknown) has to cover the whole of the country, be up to date and be in digital form. \nAwareness of the public demand and the rapid improvements in information \ntechnology have driven a number of geological surveys to digitise their data holdings \nand to improve their systems for its management and delivery to users. \n \nThis demand for geohazard information by the public has made information and its \nmanagement a very much higher priority for geological surveys. In turn, this has had \nbenefits for geo-professionals, such as engineering geologists, who need regular \naccess to geological information. In the UK, site investigation reports are increasingly \nbeing provided by the originators in digital form (see below). In addition, the BGS has \ndigitally scanned more than a million analogue borehole logs have been digitally \nscanned and a digital database of geotechnical properties has been set up that \ncontains parameter values obtained from more than 250 000 samples. In addition, a \nmulti-element geochemical database and landslide and karst features databases \nhave been set up and are being populated. This information can be all related \nspatially to the geology, as all the 1:50 000 scale maps have been digitised (Jackson \nand Green 2004), and to a high-resolution digital terrain model, as well as to a \ntopographic map base. Increasingly, access to this information is via the web, with \nsmall charges being levied for access to cover storage and management costs.  \n \nProvision of data by geological surveys \n \nThere are three factors that, collectively, distinguish geological surveys from \nuniversities or commercial businesses. They can be summarized by the words: long-\nterm, strategic and national. Arguably, the major contributor to these strengths is the \ndata and information resource they hold. For too long this asset, in large part a \nlegacy which may represent as much as 170 years of science, has been given low or \nno priority \u2013 the lion\u2019s share of funds having gone to support new mapping and \nresearch. However, times are changing and a number of geological surveys, \nincluding the BGS, have recognised the issue and are starting to place the \nmanagement and delivery of information at the heart of their organisations. They \nhave realised that to thrive (or maybe just survive!), effective strategies for \ninformation management and delivery are essential. \n  \nSo what are the key strategies that these surveys are adopting for their information \nresources? There are a number of trends and they can best be summed up in the \nword \u2018maturity\u2019. This maturity is characterised by the following activities: \n\uf0b7 Managing data responsibly as a corporate and long-term asset and not as a \ndisposable and low priority part of an individual research project. \n\uf0b7 Recognising that the data already held in the survey archives is just as \nimportant as the new mapping and research. \n\uf0b7 Being consistent and developing, agreeing and using organisational \n\/national\/international standards. \n\uf0b7 Converting as much paper data as possible to digital format (see below). \n\uf0b7 Working routinely in three dimensions as opposed to two. \n\uf0b7 Developing end-to-end digital workflows. \nand last but certainly not least, \n\uf0b7 Acknowledging that if you are a national survey then you should be aspiring \nto produce national datasets and not just a collection of diverse (or anarchic, \nto be provocative) project databases. \n \nTacitly, at least, a number of geological surveys appear to be agreeing that they can \nno longer be idiosyncratic, introspective and amateur about their data.  \nThey recognise that they have to reach out and engage their user community. \nSurveys have to provide their customers with the data and information they need, in \nthe form they need it, when they need it. Surveys have to meet national and \ninternational legal requirements for data and information accessibility. They have to \nimprove the quality and consistency of their data and meet agreed standards, and be \ntransparent about the quality. They must improve the interoperability of data, so it \ncan be integrated with other, non-geological data \u2013 from climate measurements to \nfinancial and insurance information.  And last but not least, they must manage and \nprotect their intellectual property rights, for without this they will have few assets to \nexploit. \n  \nIn the BGS the strategy is being translated into a number of specific objectives: \n\uf0b7 An operational integrated 3D digital workflow from field to user. \n\uf0b7 A corporate architecture and system to model, manage and visualise 3\/4D \ndata. \n\uf0b7 A digital geological map database of all of Great Britain at scales from 1:625 \n000 to 1:10 000. \n\uf0b7 Digital ground instability data for urban areas at 1:10 000 scale (enhancing \nand upgrading the existing 1:50 000 scale digital datasets) \n\uf0b7 Systematic national digital cover for borehole data \n\uf0b7 Generation of 1:50 000 scale derived datasets (for example, mining, \ngroundwater flooding, contaminated land, erosion, corrosion, offshore and \nnear-shore datasets) \n\uf0b7 Knowledge transfer by electronic dissemination of information including user \nfriendly e-commerce and web-services (dynamic direct access) \n\uf0b7 Increased interoperability, through improved metadata and data \narchitectures and use of extensible mark-up languages (xml) \n \nTo deliver these objectives and continue to provide long-term secure data storage \nand effective access to the increasing volumes of data, information and knowledge, \nwill require BGS to exploit fully advances in information technology.  \n \nFull advantage is being taken of e-Science initiatives (and in particular GRID \ntechnologies); BGS systems will become more collaborative in nature, using the \nstrengths of client-server architecture and migrating to advanced web-based \nnetworks providing shared processing and data resources (for example, digital \ngeological map data). For major commercial clients, government departments and \nagencies and scientific collaborators on major projects, a \u2018web-services\u2019 approach, \nproviding secure and flexible access through customised web portals to data and \nsystems, is seen to be the most appropriate way to deliver information in the future \n(for example, Alker et al. 2002).  These web-services will facilitate greater interaction \nand cross-disciplinary work and government and commercial clients will have access \nto the latest BGS digital information in the way they want it, without the need for local \nstorage and management of BGS data. The Digital Energy Atlas and Library (DEAL) \nData Registry, developed and managed by BGS and funded by the UK Offshore \nOperators Association, gives a glimpse of one way to deliver data in the future \n(Figure 1).  A second example is the GeoReports system, a full e-commerce web-\nenabled GIS, which generates bespoke plain English language reports on the \ngeology, hydrogeology or instability of an area (Figure 2).  This system is also an \nexample of another strand in the BGS strategy, which is, to ensure that geological \ninformation is comprehensible to those who are not degree-qualified geoscientists: \neffective outreach is regarded as crucial.  \n \nDigital capture of data in the field and advanced 3D and 4D processing, modelling \nand visualisation systems will provide tools for unified workflow management and \nspatial modelling, maximising the value of the geoscience knowledge held by \ngeological surveys. In this and other areas, manipulation of remotely sensed data \n(such as LIDAR and InSAR) is envisaged as playing an increasing role. A \nGeoscience Visualisation Centres are being developed (for example, at the BGS and \nat the University of Durham, UK) to enable complex multi-themed information to be \npresented as interactive and dynamic models using advanced Virtual \nReality\/Augmented Reality technologies. This is another development that will help \ndata providers to reach out and improve the appreciation of the relevance geological \nknowledge.   \n \nWhile the focus is on developing improved delivery of digital data, there still will be a \ncontinuing demand for hard-copy output. Thus, work on developing (digital) \npublication services will continue, with new systems providing flexible access to \ncustomised print-on-demand maps and books, (incorporating, for example, site-\ncentred mapping and thematic selection facilities). \n All of these developments will depend on unglamorous but fundamental data \nmanagement protocols (and the underpinning quality and security systems).  Further, \nwhile cost recovery is becoming a key part of the business model of many geological \nsurveys, effective intellectual property rights control will also be critical. Last, but not \nleast, an enhanced programmes to enhance public understanding of science will \nimprove links to schools and raise the profile of geoscience with the general public by \nproviding improved access to more exciting new material, both in print and on the \nweb. Geological surveys must continue to communicate their science, not only to \ngovernment, industry and commerce, but also to the public, and to children to ensure \nthe development of the next generation of earth scientists! \n \nData management \n \nEngineering geologists and geotechnical engineers generate a wealth of spatially \nreferenced geoscientific data, which traditionally has been documented in site \ninvestigation (SI) reports. A large number of these reports now exist, estimated at in \nexcess of a million for the UK, which represent a valuable national resource that can \nbe \u2018harvested\u2019 to produce a range of new knowledge. However, these legacy data \nneed to be managed carefully to ensure that the information they contain remains of \nvalue. A range of issues potentially limits their usefulness including the format, \nevolving standards, and scattered nature of the reports. \n \nThe resource \nThe majority of engineering geology data comprise paper-based SI reports of one \nform or another. A small, but increasing percentage of data is digitally captured and \ncommunicated to end-users in electronic transfer formats, such as the Association of \nGeotechnical and Geoenvironmental Specialists (AGS) transfer format (Anon. \n1999a). The paper-based records have a number of advantages and a range of \ndisadvantages. The principle advantages are: \n\uf0b7 The familiar format of a bound report is still user-friendly and has more \ngravitas than a purely digital report. \n\uf0b7 Paper reports are seen to have a higher preservation potential than purely \ndigital records, which are perceived of as part of the transient short-term \ncomputing culture. This is an important consideration when subsequent legal \ndisputes between parties may hinge on the veracity and integrity of the original \nreport.  \n\uf0b7 Evidential status of digital documents has only recently become clear and \nrequires the investment in and maintenance of an electronic records \nmanagement system. \n \nThe principal disadvantages of the paper-based reports are: \n\uf0b7 Cost of long-term storage of paper records means that there is pressure to \nreduce costs by disposal of records as soon as possible, or to store them in \nunsatisfactory conditions in which the records deteriorate rapidly. \n\uf0b7 The difficultly of reusing the data held on the printed pages within the report. \n \nStandards and best practice change with time. For example, the current British \nStandard Code of Practice for Site Investigation was published in 1999 (Anon. \n1999b). However, it was originally issued in 1950 and was extensively revised in \n1957 and 1981 (Anon. 1950; 1957; 1981a). These standards are supported by best \npractice guidance from professional associations (particularly the Geological Society \nand the Institution of Civil Engineers), which provide further advice and clarification \n(for example, Anon. 1970; 1972; 1977; 1981b; 1981c; 1995). Over the time that site \ninvestigation has been undertaken, the accuracy and ease of measurement has also \nincreased, making it possible to include a larger number of more accurate tests within \nreports as time passed. The result is that the way SI reports are created has changed \nover time and should not be assumed to be stable. \n \nSI reports, though numerous, are rarely centrally managed. They are normally held in \noffices of site investigation companies, geotechnical engineers, other professionals, \nlocal authorities and clients for a short period after completion of the work before they \nare moved on to some other form of storage. A few far-sighted companies had \npolicies of microfilming reports but many created warehouses containing numerous \nfiling cabinets, or used contract storage companies to hold the documents. Some \norganisations have attempted to systematically donate data to the geological survey \norganisation in their country, as is the case with the UK Highways Agency, which \ndonates to the British Geological Survey\u2019s National Geoscience Data Centre. \n The general picture is of a resource, which is largely on paper, conforming to \nprogressively evolving standards, held in a distributed manner over a wide \ngeographical area and with no single authoritative source that provides an overview \nof information that is available. \n \nManaging the resource \nThe management of this paper legacy, and its digital derivatives, itself is subject to \nrecords management standards (principally Anon. 2001). The management falls into \ntwo main activities: the creation of metadata and the physical management of the \nrecords themselves. \n \nMetadata is essentially data about data. It is a method of describing a data item, \ndataset or group of related datasets so that a potential user can determine if they are \nfit for the intended use. Metadata is often described as the \u2018who, what, why, where, \nwhen and how of data\u2019. It is a powerful tool for understanding data and its \ncomplexities and subtleties. It is particularly appropriate for describing legacy \nengineering geology data where there is a range of issues that need to be \ndocumented.  \n  \nAs discussed above, there is inherent variability within site investigation information \nrelating to the evolving standards and developing best practice. This variability needs \nto be documented by the metadata so that those reusing the data clearly understand \nits limitations and constraints. This will enable them to use the data with confidence. \n \nMetadata is itself subject to national and international standards (for example, Anon. \n2003). This and associated standards define how any spatially located information \nshould be documented in metadata. This comprehensive standard covers many \neventualities that need not be used for a given knowledge domain, such as site \ninvestigation. This is recognised by the development of individual \u2018profiles,\u2019 which are \neffectively a subset of Anon. (2003) relevant to a specific knowledge domain. These \nare currently being defined, such as the UK GEMINI profile being jointly developed \nby the UK Association of Geographic Information (AGI) and the Cabinet Office\u2019s \ne-Government Unit, which is focused on Discovery Metadata. A profile for \ngeotechnical data would provide clarity and improve communication. \n \nAll records created by any organisation have a life cycle. Typically when a record is \nfirst created it is consulted frequently. As the information in a record grows older it \nbecomes less useful and is consulted less frequently. Eventually it will cease to be \nconsulted for the purpose for which it was originally collected. The National Archive in \nEngland and Wales uses the terms \u201ccurrent\u201d, \u201csemi-current\u201d and \u201carchive\u201d to describe \nthese three phases in the life of a record. Best practice in records management \nrequires that records be reviewed regularly \u2013 a process known as records appraisal. \nIts purpose is to plan the stages of the life cycle of a record and develop appropriate \npolicies for each of these phases. The plan is known as a retention schedule in which \nthe time periods at each phase of the life is estimated and provision is made to store \nthe records in the most appropriate and cost-effective environment during each \nphase of its life. All good retention schedules are accompanied by a disposal \nschedule, which declares the policies under which a record is disposed of and what \nwill happen to it. \n \nA typical SI report will have a short \u201ccurrent\u201d phase during the planning of a \ndevelopment, a longer \u201csemi-current\u201d phase while the development is constructed \nand a long \u201carchive\u201d period while the record is retained as evidence of good practice. \nAt the end of the archive period there are normally two options. The first is the \ndestruction of a record, typically by shredding or incineration. The second is transfer \nof the SI report to a third-party who wishes to re-use the record for another purpose. \n \nIn Britain, the BGS\u2019s National Geoscience Data Centre actively seeks SI reports to \nsupport the geological mapping and other research projects. It also provides a \nservice supplying non-confidential borehole records to organisations conducting desk \nstudies. Other countries have similar schemes to reuse a range of legacy borehole \ninformation for a range of purposes, for example, a project in Manitoba to build 3D \ngeological models using legacy boreholes (Thorleifson and Pyne 2003). \n \nThe physical management of paper-based records can be an expensive operation. A \ntypical volume of a bound A4 size SI report currently costs about \u00a34 (\u20ac6) per year to \nstore in filing cabinets in commercial office space. These costs reduce to about \u00a32 \n(\u20ac3) in a records centre on rolling shelving or other compact storage system. Of \ncourse, these prices will vary considerably depending upon location but it is clear that \nstoring hundreds of reports in office filing cabinets and thousands in data centres will \ncost considerable sums. The alternative is to save money on storage costs by using \ninappropriate storage environments (Figure 3). \n \nGoing Digital \nMany organisations are now producing digital versions of their SI reports. These take \na number of forms: \n\uf0b7 The traditional report published in digital format, for example, Portable \nDocument Format (PDF). \n\uf0b7 Report data produced in a data transfer format such as the AGS transfer \nformat (see above). \n\uf0b7 Scans of legacy SI reports held as image files, for example, jpg2000 or tiff. \n\uf0b7 Abstractions of data from the original report, paper or digital, and held in a \ndatabase (Culshaw 2005). \n \nPublishing reports in a digital format, such as PDF, improves the availability of the \nreport by allowing rapid reproduction, reduces publication costs and reduces storage \ncosts. Some digital formats can be locked at publication so that they are not \nsubsequently changed. However, to ensure legal admissibility of records appropriate \nquality assured systems must be in place. \n \nThe AGS, and similar transfer formats are being increasingly used to pass \ngeotechnical information between organisations. This allows the information to be \nloaded directly into compliant geotechnical engineering software ready for \nprocessing. It reduces the problems and costs associated with entering data from \npaper-based or locked digital reports. However, the record itself is transferred as \nCSV (comma separated variable) format (XML format in the future) and can easily be \nchanged without a record of the change having been recorded in the file. It is \ntherefore not acceptable as evidence. \n \nMany organisations, including the British Geological Survey, are currently engaged in \nprogrammes to scan borehole and other geotechnical engineering records. The \nadvantages of this are: \n\uf0b7 Creating a security copy of key records as part of a disaster recovery strategy. \n\uf0b7 Reducing costs of storage. \n\uf0b7 Improving accessibility of records.  \n\uf0b7 Centralised management of records formally held on multiple sites. \n \nWhere the data from a SI report is reused for a non-geotechnical engineering \npurpose, such as geological mapping, the data needs to be abstracted into a \ndatabase in which it can be manipulated to produce the desired output. This \nabstraction can be done from paper-based SI reports or can be speeded up by \nmanipulating data in digital transfer formats. Typical outputs of such a database are \nillustrated in Figures 4 and 5. \n \nConclusions \n \nWithin a few years, the conventional \u2018desk study\u2019 that should form an important part \nof all site investigations will have been revolutionised. The digitisation of much of the \ninformation held by geological surveys is enabling easier access to it via the web. \nThis, and the development of web search engines for academic publications, means \nthat, potentially, engineering geologists at their computers will be able to obtain \ninformation on relevant past publications, previous site investigations carried out near \ntheir location of interest, view 2D geological maps, digital terrain models, borehole \nlogs and geotechnical test results and use attributed 3D models of the shallow \nsubsurface to design their investigation and help interpret its results. However, this \nnew capability, driven by the advances in information technology and the new priority \ngiven by geological surveys to their information holdings, brings with it increased \nresponsibilities for data maintenance and management. Also, users will probably \nneed to accept that they will have to pay a modest charge to access this information. \nUnless taxpayers, through their governments, are willing to pay the increased costs \nof digitisation and digital data management, the era of public bodies, such as \ngeological surveys, freely providing access to geological information will pass \ncompletely. However, once engineering geologists and other users appreciate the \nbenefits of the newly available information in digital form, it is likely that the cultural \nchange will come to be accepted and the ways in which we interpret the ground will \nbe changed significantly. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British \nGeological Survey (NERC). \n \nReferences \n \nAlker, S.
