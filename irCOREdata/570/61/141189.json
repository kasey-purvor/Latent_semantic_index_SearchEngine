Introduction\n1.1. Research background\nWithin production for MST, the need to deliver services to aid and enhance the\nuse of MST is crucial to the production strategy or business model adopted by a\nMST company. This is because MST production is underpinned by services\ndelivered through research and development competence houses and design\nhouses (Wilkinson, 2000). Services delivered by MST companies centre on\ntechnical expertise and extensive knowledge of MST management and market,\nand years of experience in the MST industry. MST production employs\nminiaturisation and integration techniques which show significant similarities to\nthose of integrated circuit processes (Haskard et al., 1995). However, MST differs\nfrom microelectronics as it exploits a wide range of phenomena; not just\nelectronics \u2013 such as electromagnetism, optics, fluidics, mechanics, tribology, and\nspectrometry just to mention a few. Consequently, due to the highly technical\nnature of MST production, very rarely is an MST offered to MST customers\nwithout the delivery of some form of services.\n1.2. Aim of paper\nThis paper evaluates the current state of service delivery within MST production.\nThe aim of the paper is to: (i) analyse the main types of services delivered by\nMST companies, and (ii) make recommendations for improving MST production.\nIn order to accomplish this, the product-service system (PSS) approach to\nmanufacturing and production will be introduced and used to carry out a study to\nevaluate service delivery within MST production. Recommendations based on the\nfindings of the study will then be used to suggest possible areas for improving\nfuture MST production.\n1.3. Product-service systems and microsystems production\nA PSS has been defined as \u2018an integrated product and service offering that\ndelivers value in use\u2019 (Baines et al., 2007). It involves making use of social\nconstructs (organisations) that detail the network of actors, roles and scenarios for\n3delivering a blend products and services (solutions) that are largely dependent on\nthe domain of application, investment and resources (Durugbo et al., 2009).\nA PSS is a business model based on value propositions according to product, use\nor result orientations, as shown in Fig. 1 (Tukker, 2004; Schuh et al., 2008). In\nproduct-orientation, the company offers the sale of products and also opens\nchannels with the customer for access to additional services such as upgrades\nwhereas in use-orientation, the company maintains the rights to a product for use\nin a service environment made accessible to the receiver via services such as\nproduct leasing. Result- orientation involves the company delivering contents of a\nservice to the customer, independent of product choice in schemes such as paying-\nper-unit service.\nA PSS also offers a generic approach to production that can be applied to identify\ngaps and opportunities for service creation and production improvements across\nindustries and industry sectors such as MST production (Durugbo et al., 2010).\nThis is in contrast to the production classification by Yole D\u00e9veloppement (2009)\nthat captures seven main groups (made up of system manufacturers with internal\nfabrication facilities, system manufacturers with external fabrication facilities,\nfabless companies, contract manufacturers, engineering and design, off-the-shelf\nmanufacturers and foundries) for MST production or Wilkinson\u2019s (2007) industry\nstructure that identifies a four-tier arrangement (consisting of foundries,\ncomponent manufacturers, device manufacturers and instrument \/equipment\nbuilders) for the MST industry. Whereas these proposed classification and\nindustry structure are based on the interaction of consultants with industrial\ncompanies, the PSS approach systematises production in companies irrespective\nof the industry sector.\nInsert Figure\nHowever, the PSS approach is hindered by the absence of a comprehensive\nstandard model for characterising PSS structure and behaviour (Durugbo et al.,\n2010). Furthermore, the adoption of the PSS approach by companies may offer\nlittle or no potential for system innovation in sectors such as: the tools industry,\nmanufacturing firms, telecommunication companies, ship makers, paper mills,\nand the automotive industry (Schuh et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2010; Sundin et al.,\n42010; Williams, 2007). It is for this reason that in some cases it may not be\ncommercially or economically sensible to apply a PSS (Manzini and Vezzoli,\n2002). The key therefore is to first determine if a PSS is right for the company\nand its customers or market sector. Also, studies such as Williams (2007) have\nshown, it is important to determine the level of diffusion of PSS value\npropositions. Differences in companies based on PSS value propositions can then\nbe used to suggest ways of realising system innovation (Williams, 2007).\nNonetheless, the PSS approach is suited to this study because unlike existing\nclassifications and industry structures within the MST domain, the PSS approach\ncan be applied to evaluate current practise in service delivery for improving MST\nproduction in terms of two key factors: service engineering that highlights the\nimportance of creating and delivering services for added customer value during\nthe life cycle of a product, as shown in Fig. 2, from the engineering phase through\nto the usage phase and the recycling\/disposal phase (Aurich et al., 2006; Sakao\nand Shimomura, 2007; Tan et al., 2010), and industry partnerships for\nrelationships and networks based on multi-actors collaborations (Durugbo et al.,\n2010).\nInsert Figure\nWithin the context of MST production, these factors have played key roles in\nfostering the growth of the MST industry.\nServices engineering plays a key role in enabling access to the MST industry\nthrough operations, management and support activities such as design and s upply\nservices (Devlin, 2004) and field services (Lin et al., 2005). These services\nsupport MST production processes in terms of design consultancy, system-level\ntesting and prototyping. By applying services during MST life cycles, industry\ngrowth has been promoted in schemes where non-recurring engineering costs are\nreduced to realise shorter production times as identified by Wilkinson (2007).\nServices related to MST life cycle are also required to assess the environmental\nconsequences of design decisions (Schischke et al., 2005).\nPartnerships are the basis for alliances involving foundry companies, equipment\nand material suppliers, software vendors, academic institutions and governmental\norganisations (Fujita, 2007). These alliances according to Fujita (2007) are vital to\n5minimising fabrication costs so as to promote small-volume-large-variety\nproduction. Production management partnerships such as fabless-foundry\npartnerships are also important for enhancing coordination and information flow\nfor information sharing (Guo et al., 2007).\nSince MST production is moving from a \u2018surprise to an enterprise phase\u2019 (Fujita,\n2007) with recent projections by consultancy firms such as Yole D\u00e9veloppement\n(2009) forecasting continuous growth and capital returns in the MST industry, it is\ntherefore important to evaluate current practice in MST production so as to\nunderstand service delivery needs.\nThis understanding of service delivery can be applied by MST companies to\nextend the life of MST based product, improve MST production times and costs,\nand provide added value for MST customers.\nThe focus of this paper is to evaluate current practise in service delivery within\nMST production. The paper plans to contribute to knowledge by: evaluating\nservice delivery within MST production using the PSS approach as a guide, and\nmaking recommendations for improving future MST production.\n1.4. Structure of paper\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: \u00a72 describes the\nmethodology for the study to evaluate service delivery within MST production, \u00a73\npresents the findings of the study while \u00a74 highlights and discusses possible areas\nfor future MST production improvement.\n2. Research method\nThe study to evaluate MST production based on the PSS approach was undertaken\nin four stages: sample selection, network identification, data collection and data\nrepresentation.\n2.1. Sample selection\nDuring the first stage, sample selection, a total of 100 MST companies were\nsampled for the study. These companies are headquartered at locations in Europe\n6(56%), North America (38%) and Asia (6%) as shown in Fig. 3. The sample was\nbased on a random selection of member companies of the MEMS Industry Group\n(http:\/\/www.memsindustrygroup.org), IVAM (http:\/\/www.ivam.de) and SEMI\n(http:\/\/www.semi.org). MEMS Industry Group, IVAM and SEMI are international\nassociations for companies aiming to carry out business transactions within the\nMST industry.\nThe sample was selected for use in this study to provide a representative sample\nof the MST domain and all sampled companies delivered integrated MST\nproducts and services offerings.\nInsert Figure\nAn initial inspection of sampled companies revealed four main product sectors\nwithin which MST companies operate to offer a wide range of customer solutions.\nOf the sampled companies 78% offered micromechanical solutions, 72% offered\nmicro-optical solutions, 69% offered microfluidic solutions and 40% offered radio\nfrequency\/microwave solutions, as shown in Fig 4. In the figure, the\nmicromechanical companies were identified from groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h and l\n(i.e. 31+22+4+1+7+1+1+11 = 78) whereas the micro-optical companies were\ncaptured from groups a, b, c, e, f, i, j and m (i.e. 31+22+4+0+7+3+0+5 = 72). The\nmicrofluidic companies were ascertained from groups a, b, d, e, g, i, k and n (i.e.\n31+22+1+0+1+3+0+11 = 69) whereas the radio frequency\/microwave companies\nwere captured from groups a, c, d, e, h, j, k and o (i.e. 31+4+1+0+1+0+0+3 = 40).\nInsert Figure\nAn inspection of company documentation and reports also revealed that MST\nproduction was characterised by the delivery of five types of product offerings to\nbusiness-to-business (B2B) customers (mainly original equipment manufacturers\n(OEMs) and university \/ research institutions):\n1) Chips in the form of bare die created using material such as plastics,\nceramics, silicon and adhesives.\n2) Miniaturised and integrated devices (or micro-integrated devices) that\ncontain chips and are packaged to perform microscopic tasks or are used in\n7micro-instruments and micro-machines. This group also contains\ninterconnections\/packaging that are required for protecting devices and\nchips, and for interactions with the environment\n3) Micro-instruments developed from chips and micro-integrated devices,\nand applied for specialised tasks such as Lab-on-a-chip systems that are\nused for biochemical analysis.\n4) Microfabrication machines and microfabrication machine parts used to\nmanufacture chips, micro-integrated devices and micro-instruments based\non technologies such as bulk and surface micromanufacturing, LIGA\n(Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung) process etc\nThe study also identified intangible products associated with design and\ndevelopment processes within the sampled companies. Design processes centre on\nactivities involving the use of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to virtually\ngenerate, simulate, verify and validate MST architectures. Development of MST\nproducts focuses on the use of fabrication capabilities and technical expertise of\nMST engineers. Two main intangible products offerings were identified for MST\ndesign and development processes:\n1) MST designs and Intellectual Property (IP) detailing the architecture or\nthe process for fabricating chips, micro-integrated device, micro-\ninstruments and micro-machines.\n2) MST software packages for generating, simulating, verifying and\nvalidating MST design.\n2.2. Network identification\nFour possible collaborative actors that deliver services for added customer value\nduring MST production, as shown in Fig. 5, were identified based on the\ncompanies examined for this study. These actors include developers, designers,\nconsultants and marketers that assume roles for scenarios in a value network\n(value-net) of MST suppliers to deliver products and services.\nThe survey sample was made up of 77 developers, 7 designers, 10 consultants and\n6 marketers. Companies also assumed multiple roles (3 designers and all sampled\ndevelopers also assumed consultancy roles, and 3 developers also acted as\ndesigners when required to deliver a complete MST based product).\n8Developers consist of foundries and component, device and instrument\nmanufacturers as captured by Wilkinson\u2019s (2007) four-tier arrangement of the\nMST industry. In addition, this study also identifies prototype manufacturers as\ndevelopers designed to support MST production by offering physical prototypes\nof MST products prior to mass-production. The results of prototype testing aid in\nthe transformation or modification of designs into MST based products for use in\nconsumer products.\nInsert Figure\nThe term designers is used in this study to identify software companies that\ndesign and deliver a wide range of commercial computer-aided design (CAD)\npackages that are summarised in Table 1. These tools incorporate a wide range of\nmodules for creating complex MST models, device simulation, and for verifying\nthe properties of MST using numeric solvers, compatibility with IC simulators\netc.\nInsert Table\nDesigners are also used in this study to identify intellectual property (IP) solution\ncompanies. An IP is a predesigned, pre-verified, complex functional block, based\non a hierarchical design for the development of MST based products. An IP\nsolution usually involves a complete process and device design for specific\napplications such the MEMS microphone and biochips. These IP solutions are\nused to realise various configurations for MST architectures at the chip, package\nor board level.\nOf the 77 developers sampled in this study, 50 offered chips, 59 manufactured\nmicro-integrated devices, 59 delivered micro-instruments, and 9 were\nmicrofabrication machine manufacturers while 31 owned foundries. Also, of the 7\ndesigners sampled in this study, 3 offered IP solutions, 3 offered CAD packages\nand 1 company offered both IP solutions and CAD software packages for\ndesigning and developing chips, micro-integrated devices and micro-instruments.\nThe study also identified and examined two other industry actors designed to\nsupport MST design and development: consultants, and marketers.\n9MST consultants offer various organisational, technological, economical and\nhuman factors focused advice on MST start-up, production, recruitment,\ntechnologies, education and management.\nMarketers are distributors or suppliers concerned with the buying of products\nfrom developers and the selling or distribution of products to customers or end\nusers. An understanding of MST and extensive knowledge of MST products are\nimportant technical skills of marketers. The sale of MST based products is either\ncarried out by a specialist distributor focused on microfluidic, microoptical or\nmicromechanical technologies, or by broad line distributors that offer wide range\nof MST based products.\nFig. 5 also identifies development activities by a wide range of research\ninstitutions (largely universities) that investigate MST designs for the\ndevelopment of prototypes. These institutions, in order to engage in MST\nproduction, typically assume other roles such as consultancy, MST design or MST\ndevelopment. Although, university institutions are not investigated in this study, it\nis important to note their importance to the industry for generating spin-off\ncompanies. In this study, at least 24% of the sampled companies were spin-offs\nfrom research institutions, 4% were start-ups by multinational companies\nwhereas, 13% were subsidiaries or companies set up by major enterprises and\nconglomerates.\n2.3. Data collection\nThe second stage, data collection, was based on an inspection of company profiles\nby means of technical documentation, the World Wide Web (WWW) and\navailable company publications such as corporate reports and press releases.\nTelephone calls were also used in a few cases to source information on the nature\nof MST production within the sampled companies. Each of the 100 companies\nwas successively evaluated to identify delivered services, and to reveal possible\nvalue propositions based on the PSS orientations within the sampled companies.\n10\n2.4. Data representation\nThe third stage, data representation, involved making use of cross-tabulation\ntechniques to present the findings of the study based on the identified product\ntypes, delivered services and PSS value propositions.\nAs a guide for this phase, the wide accepted and cited model for PSS by Tukker\n(2004) was used to categorise and analyse MST services. The model lists PSS\nvalue propositions based on three main categories identified as product-, use- and\nresult- orientation, as shown in Fig. 1.\n3. Research findings\nThe study showed that a wide range of services, as shown in Table 2, was\ndelivered by the sampled companies to support the life-cycle of MST products.\nThe table summarises the services of the selected sample according to the various\nforms of value propositions identified in (Tukker, 2004). Each PSS value\nproposition in the MST industry will now be highlighted.\n3.1. Product-related service (value proposition 1)\nOf the sampled MST companies, product-related service (i.e. the sale of a product\ninclusive of services that are required for the use of the product) was offered by all\nthe sampled MST developers (i.e. 77% of sampled companies). The common\nproduct-related service among chips, micro-integrated device and micro-\ninstruments manufacturers, was a prototyping service to physically test and\nsimulate MST. The study also revealed that all micro-machinery and micro-\ninstrument developers also offered value propositions based on service contracts\nduring the sale of products, with warranty, field support, installation, relocation\nand contract options for services such as maintenance and repair. Field support\ndescribes the process of sending out technicians to undertake specific tasks to\nsupport such as machine checkups and system testing. Additional product-related\nservices were offered by microfabrication machines and micro-instrument\nmanufacturers in the form of software upgrades to improve machine use, and\nhardware upgrades based on continuity in machine family lines such as plasma\netch and deposition platforms and systems. Diagnostics and work-in-process\n11\nservices are usually incorporated in microfabrication machines and micro-\ninstruments for added value and for maintaining an audit trail to assist engineers\nin routine maintenance and fault diagnosis.\nInsert Table\n3.2. Training, advice and consultancy (value proposition 2)\nThe study showed that offering advice on the efficient use of a product is realised\nin three different forms: general advice\/consultancy for MST, training for MST\ndesign, and training in the use of MST equipment (machinery and instrument) for\nMST development.\n73% of the sampled companies for this study offered a wide range of general\nconsultancy services focused on fabricated products i.e. chips, micro-integrated\ndevices, micro-instruments and micro-machines. Consulting offered by\ncompanies focuses on issues such as state-of-the-art market surveys, technology\nstrategy, failure analysis, cost of start-up, solicitation of venture capital, types of\ntechnology, feasibility studies, and so on. These activities are designed to promote\nprofitable manufacturing operations, sustainable system production and affordable\ncustomer solutions. Advice on the other hand centres on the selection and use of\nproducts to carry out multiple tasks. In some cases where MST were marketed as\n\u2018tools kits\u2019 that performed multiple functions such as microchemical and\nmicrobiological analysis, companies also offered advice on the purchasing and the\nincorporation of additional modules to perform other tasks such as temperature\ncontrol, electrical and optical measurements, and reagent introduction.\nMST developers also provided the opportunity for customers to access an online\nsupport service designed as walkthroughs for product related issues such as how\nto fix bugs or use device features. In other cases, customised user accounts were\nprovided to manage access to a repository service for technical literature detailing\nproduct specification and for describing application technologies to support\noperability.\nIn terms of training for MST design, the study revealed that 15% of the sampled\ncompanies focused on a wide range of aspects associated with MST to offer\nsupport for various products. 8 out of the 50 chip manufacturers, 10 out of the 59\n12\nmicro-integrated device manufacturers and 11 out of the 59 micro-instrument\nmanufacturers focused on training for current\/emerging design paradigms in\nMST. These design paradigms range from Network-on-chip (NoC) for improve\ncommunication in system architectures, to Hardware\/Software (HW\/SW) co-\ndesign for dealing with complexity in the design of MST. Similarly, 6 out of the 7\nsampled MST designers offered training courses and resources for creating\ndesigns (CAD engineers) and for applying IP blocks to realise MST architectures\n(IP solution providers).\nThe study also revealed that 14% of the sampled companies most of whom were\nmicrofabrication machine manufacturers, offered workshops, training course and\nseminars on the use of supplied machinery and related technologies such as\nadvanced fluids, combustion and radiation hydrodynamic analysis.\n3.3. Product lease and product renting or sharing (value proposition\n3 and 4)\nIn the sampled MST companies, maintaining ownership of a product that is leased\nout to a receiver based on unlimited and exclusive access to use of the product,\nwas identified among all the designers (7 companies) selected for the study (CAD\nengineers and IP solution providers).\nCAD packages are typically offered to customers based on a renewable licence,\nusually one year. Furthermore, these CAD packages are offered with varying\ndegrees of functionalities and features depending on the nature of the package\noption (and cost). The package options centre on various functionalities for\nphysical, device, system, and process modelling that are applied to: simulate MST\narchitectures, create layout masks, create 3D models of physical properties and\ndefine fabrication processes. Most CAD systems incorporate numeric solvers for\ncreating, analysing and verifying the properties of MST, and for creating complex\nMST models that are compatibility with IC simulators.\nFor IP solution providers, this value proposition is the business model on which\ntheir companies are shaped. IP solutions are licensed out to companies based on\nservice terms (normally yearly). By using technologies such as the internet and\ninformation technologies (IT) these companies are delivering tangibles (IP and\nCAD package execution files) for customer solutions without physical\n13\ncomponents, thereby minimising material input and maximising revenue\ngeneration.\nIn the sampled companies, the renting out of a product with controlled, limited\nand sequential access to a receiver (product renting and sharing) was also\nidentified in 26% (8 out of 31) of developers with manufacturing foundries. These\nidentified foundries were owned by large research institutions set up by industry,\nacademic and government collaborations to promote MST research, or set up as\nsubsidiaries of a corporation composed using in-house or externally acquired\nfacilities. Value proposition in these foundries is based on sharing fabrication\ncapabilities with other sectors of a corporation or based on leasing parts or blocks\nwithin the foundry to smaller businesses \u2013 usually start-ups from the leaser. At\nleast one case was found where a company (a start-up) rents a block in a foundry\nfacility (the research institution from where the start-up was created), employing\nits own fabrication team and delivering solutions based on its technological\ncapabilities.\n3.4. Activity management\/outsourcing (value proposition 5)\nOutsourcing as a value proposition can be defined as a scheme whereby functions\nor processes for customer solutions are procured from an outside source. For\ninstance, a developer may procure the services of a marketer to distribute its\nproducts or a micro-integrated device manufacturer may procure a foundry service\nto manufacture its chips, packaging and assembly. For this study, 8% of sampled\ncompanies (mostly micro-integrated device manufacturers) outsourced their\nfabrication processes to foundries whereas 15% of sampled companies (mostly\nfoundries) outsourced the distribution and sales of their products to marketers. In\nMST production, this is usually done for three main reasons: firstly, when a\ncustomer places a very large order (usually in the order of 106 or 109) and a\ncompany lacks the capabilities to fulfil the order, secondly, to take advantage of\nan outsourcers capabilities as a means of shortening the time to market a product,\nand thirdly, as a cost cutting or saving measure that allows the outsourcer to\nconcentrate on improving their capabilities and streamlining their in-house\nprocesses of research, development and application (R-D-A) for MST.\n14\n3.5. Pay-per-service unit (value proposition 6)\nAll the fabrication (fab) companies and manufacturing foundries (31% of sampled\ncompanies) deliver the pay per service unit value proposition (i.e. selling the\noutput of a product instead of the product itself). The product in this case is the\nmicro-fabrication machine and instruments in the foundry (or \u2018fab\u2019) whereas the\nservice unit include wafers, chips, micro-integrated device, packaging,\ninterconnections and so on. An MST foundry is a service facility with a\ncleanroom environment that houses microfabrication and micromanufacturing\ntools that are employed to produce MST. Foundry services usually involve design,\ntesting, process, production, package and assembly support in attempt to deliver a\n\u2018one shop mass production process\u2019 capability. The need to support these highly\ntechnical functions probably accounts for why 90% (18 of the 20) of foundries in\nthis study also offered consultancy and advice services.\n4. Discussion\nMotivated by the findings from the studied companies, a set of recommendations\nare now discussed. These recommendations concentrate on service delivery\nanalysis and management for improving current practise within MST production.\n4.1. Service delivery analysis for microsystems production\nAs shown by this study, specific value propositions of the PSS model are realised\nby the different actors that have been identified in Section 2.2. It is however\nimportant to note that the examples and identified value propositions are not\nintended to give an exhaustive analysis of the industry. Rather, it is designed to\npromote subsequent and wider evaluation of industry sectors using the PSS\nmodel.\nHowever, a cross tabulation of MST based product types and value propositions\nof the PSS model as shown in Table 3 suggests possible areas for creating and\nimproving services in the MST industry by introducing PSS value propositions.\nSome of these value propositions (at least for now) may not be practical or\nlogical. In some other cases, the constraints imposed by form factors or\nintellectual property may hinder the implementation of a value proposition.\n15\nFor instance, the renting or leasing of a chip or die is a value proposition that is\nnot rational. On the other hand the leasing of a foundry or the leasing of machines\nto promote access to fabrication technologies offers more plausible means for\nmanufacturers to create value during delivery.\nInsert Table\nIn terms of providing PSS value propositions, functional result (result-oriented)\nand product pooling (use-oriented) as shown in Table 3 are noticeably absent in\nthe sampled companies. The functional result value proposition centres on a\nprovider delivering the result of product based on agreement with a client. In\nindustry, this value proposition could be particularly beneficial for instrument\nmanufacturers where the measurements and analysis of phenomena of such as\nDNA analysis or cell handling and sorting in microfluidic applications are the\nfunctional results required of a product. Product pooling is similar to product\nsharing and leasing in that it centres on the control of a product. It is however\nunique and different because it is based on the concurrent use of a product.\nAlso, a summary of the services, from Section 3, suggests that service delivery for\nMST production has predominantly centred on providing engineering, production\nand engineering life-cycle phase services, as shown in Table 4. The life-cycle\nphase services contained in the table are taken from Fig. 1 in which the actual\nproduct life cycle has been compared with the manufacturers\u2019 and users\u2019 views of\nlife cycles. Table 4 also shows that services within the MST domain have also\nsupported product and service design as well as product purchasing and usage.\nHowever, there is a lack of services to support the end-of-life phases for recycling,\nspare parts manufacturing, product reengineering and disposal.\nConsequently, there is a need for greater awareness and studies on MST end-of-\nlife phase services to minimise environmental impacts of MST production.\nAwareness and accessibility to MST is a challenge for the MST industry in\nrelation to market penetration where consumers are cautious in the use of new\nproducts (Ohlckers and Jakobsen, 1998).\nCompliance with environmental standards offers a unique opportunity for\ncompanies to build customer confidence, making MST products more desirable\nand reinforcing the \u2018win-win\u2019 scenario of life cycle engineering for customers and\n16\nmanufacturers (Mont et al., 2006). Customers \u2018win\u2019 due to affordable solutions\nand costs that spread across the product-life cycle whereas manufacturers \u2018win\u2019\ndue to profitable operations and efficient resource use. There is also a third win\nscenario (i.e. a win-win-win) in which the environment as an enabler for a PSS\nwins due to minimised environmental impacts of MST production.\nInsert Table\nStudies are therefore required to investigate and analyse key life cycle costing and\nassessment issues that affect, economical and ecological aspects of MST\nproduction. Future work may also assess which of the PSS has been the most\nprofitability for the MST sector.\n4.2. Service delivery management for the microsystems industry\nAs earlier mentioned, the sample for this study was based on members companies\nof organisations for companies aiming to carry out business transactions within\nthe MST industry. Further analysis of company documentation and websites\nsuggested that MST coalitions provided the main means for the management of\nservice delivery, particularly for outsourcing tasks. MST coalitions are described\nhere as cooperative ventures and associations set up among MST manufacturers\nfor managing various stages of production or for promoting the education and\ncommercialisation of MST. Coalitions for MST production may be set up for\ndelivering complete customer solutions such as INTEGRAM\u2122 in Europe and\nCMC in Canada, or for investigating research needs of MST such as the MEMS\nApplications for Defence (MEAD) consortium.\nCollaborative partnerships between industry and academia are common and\nevident by regular start-ups and spin-offs from academia to industry and research\nprograms involving companies and universities. Consequently, the\nrecommendations made in this subsection are mainly for academic research to\ntheoretically ground and improve current industry practise. Following the\nevaluation of the sampled companies, two main challenges for academia were\nidentified to: investigate and model collaborative networks for MST production,\nand to explore service delivery to standardise MST operations and interoperability\n17\nof MST product families for design modularity and continuity within the MST\nindustry.\nIn this study, a high-level model of the MST industry structure \u2013an MST value\nnetwork has been captured based on MST companies and actors assuming roles as\nconsultants, designers, developers and marketers. In this network, companies\ncould assume roles to reduce costs of production, to promote small-volume-large-\nvariety production and to deliver tailored and affordable customer solutions. The\nMST value network could also serve as a foundation for low-level models of MST\npartnerships such as collaborative networks. Collaborative networks are a novel\nresearch discipline motivated by challenges faced by modern businesses and\nscientific institutions (Camarinha-Matos and Afsarmanesh, 2004). Collaborative\nnetworks focus on the use of computer networks to achieve goals that exceed the\nabilities of collaborating individuals or companies involved in collaborations to\nprovide solutions that are cost effective.\nThe recommendation for research therefore is to carry out studies that define\ncharacteristics of MST collaborative networks and evaluate the implications of\ncompanies entering into collaborative networks in terms of cost, production times\nand MST affordability.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper evaluates service delivery within microsystems technology (MST)\n(also known as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)). Services offer\navenues for enabling and enhancing the use of products and within MST\nproduction, the need to deliver service is motivated by the highly technical nature\nof MST and continuous market growth of the MST industry. Motivated by these\nneeds, this study makes use of the product-service system (PSS) approach to\nevaluate and make recommendations for possible future MST production\nimprovement.\nThe PSS approach to production and manufacturing centres on offering a blend of\nproducts and services for product (sale of products with channels for additional\nservices), use (products made available within a service environment) and result\n(function of product delivered irrespective of product choice) orientations.\n18\nWithin the context of MST production, the PSS approach offers potentials for\nfostering: service engineering to provide added value for MST customers and to\nextend the life of products, and partnerships to improve production times and\ncosts.\nA sample of MST based companies that offer a range of microfluidic,\nmicrooptical, micromechanical and radio frequency\/microwave MEMS\napplications was selected to evaluate service delivery within MST production\nusing the PSS approach as a guide. Data was collected from 100 randomly\nselected MST companies (77 developers, 7 designers, 10 consultants and 6\nmarketers). Data collected from the sampled companies was based on an\ninspection of the company websites and on available company publications such\nas corporate reports and press releases.\nIn order to capture services for MST production, a value network was identified\nfor the MST industry. The MST value network was made up of developers,\ndesigners, marketers and consultants as actors for the delivery of customer\nsolutions. The paper then examined these actors and their roles in the delivery of\nvalue propositions based on the PSS approach based on product, use and result\noriented approaches.\nThe study revealed that product-orientation value propositions were offered by\n23% of companies in terms of product-related services and 74% of companies for\nconsultancy, 15% of companies for design advice and 14% of companies for\ndevelopment (or process) advice. Similarly, use-oriented value propositions were\noffered by 7% of companies in terms of product lease and 19% of companies in\nterms of product renting\/sharing whereas result-oriented value propositions were\ndelivered by 34% of companies in terms of activity management and 32% of\ncompanies in terms of pay per service unit.\nRecommendations for possible future MST production improvement were then\nused to highlight and discuss research challenges for industry and academia in\nterms of service delivery analysis and management.\n19\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to extend their sincere thanks to the Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (EPSRC), for its support via the Cranfield Innovative Manufacturing Research\nCentre (CIMRC), towards the work carried out in the preparation of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] Aurich, J.C., Fuchs, C., DeVries, M.F., 2004.
