Conferences and publications \non education, whether of policy makers or academics, overwhelmingly stress issues of \naccess to schooling and the potential benefits of formal education such as higher \npersonal income, economic growth for the wider society, physical well being and \ngood citizenship and ignore, or at least play down, its more negative aspects. Yet, \nwhile these are valid concerns and goals, in reality schooling is very far from always \nbeing safe for children. Indeed, there is a growing international literature on the \ndifferent ways in which schools both reproduce violence by failing to tackling it but \nalso actively perpetrate it through the activities of educational systems and individual \nteachers.  \n \n 2 \nUnfortunately, as the United Nations now officially recognises (Pinheiro 2006), the \nrole of schooling in sustaining overt forms of violence is both consistent and \nwidespread and manifests itself in a number of ways. Among these are: \n \n\u2022 Gendered violence where girls are sexually harassed and abused either by \nmale pupils or male teachers (Harber 2004:Ch.7; Leach and Mitchell 2006);  \n\u2022 Bullying, including homophobic bullying, either by other pupils or staff \n(Benbenishty and Astor 2005; Dulmus and Sowers 2004; Hyman and Snook \n1999; Meyer 2006) \n\u2022 Racial and ethnic prejudice, hatred and bullying (Davies 2003; Harber \n2004:Ch.6) \n\u2022 The use of corporal punishment (Hilarski 2004; Hyman and Snook 1999; \nParker-Jenkins 1999; WHO 2002) \n\u2022 The physical and mental stress and illness caused by the over-testing and \nexamination of pupils in the interests of the state rather than the pupil (Clark \nPope 2001; Harber 2004:Ch.8; Kohn 1993)  \n\u2022 The militarisation of schooling and learning to kill as part of the curriculum \n(Davies 2003; Nelles 2003; Harber 2004:Ch.9; Saltman and Gabbard 2003) \n \nMoreover, schools also play a significant role in the reproduction of \u2018structural \nviolence\u2019 (i.e. the existence of oppressive and unequal socio-economic and political \nrelationships \u2013 Galtung 1975).  In Britain, the focus of this article, schools still seem \nprimarily to be agents of social reproduction rather than social mobility. Research \ncarried out by the Sutton Trust, for example, concluded that social mobility in Britain \nwas at a standstill and that social class was still the biggest predictor of school \n 3 \nachievement or getting a degree \u2013 \u2018the advantages of being born into a privileged \nhome have not changed in 30 years\u2019 (Curtis 2007). The British political elite also \ncontinues to be dominated by the products of expensive private schools. Whereas 7% \nof the general population goes to private school, 76% of judges comes from private \nschools, 68% of barristers, 55% of solicitors, 32% of members of parliament, 42% of \nparty leaders, 56% of life peers in the House of Lords, 56% of top newspaper \njournalists and 56% of top TV journalists (Garner and Russell 2006). 90% of the most \nsenior army officers were privately educated as were six out of ten in the navy (Oliver \nand Grimston 2009). Indeed, within schools there is much evidence of the \nhierarchical, authoritarian and competitive relationships that Galtung argues are a \nform structural violence (Harber 2004: Chs2 and 8; Harber 2009).  \n \nThis article therefore is concerned with violence in school and, in particular, how one \npeace education course which focuses on learning interpersonal skills in order to \nreduce violence is in many ways at odds with the assumptions and practices of \n\u2018normal\u2019 schooling. The article begins by discussing the origins and nature of modern \nmass schooling in order to understand why such the role of schools in such violence is \npossible. It then discusses the aims of peace education before examining an empirical \nstudy of peace education in a school in England.   \n \nSchooling and Violence \n \nWhat is it about the nature of schooling that not only cannot protect young people \nfrom violence and danger but actively perpetrates it? In terms of schooling, the \n 4 \noverwhelming evidence is that the dominant or hegemonic model globally, with some \nexceptions, is authoritarian rather than democratic (Harber 2004:Ch.2). Education for \nand in democracy, human rights and critical awareness is not a primary characteristic \nof the majority of schooling. While the degree of harshness and despotism within \nauthoritarian schools varies from context to context and from institution to institution, \nin the majority of schools power over what is taught and learned, how it is taught and \nlearned, where it is taught and learned, when it is taught and learned and what the \ngeneral learning environment is like is not in the hands of pupils.  It is predominantly \ngovernment officials, headteachers and teachers who decide, not learners. Most \nschools are essentially authoritarian institutions, however benevolent or benign that \nauthoritarianism is and whatever beneficial aspects of learning are imparted.  In this \nauthoritarian situation of relative powerlessness and neglect of their human rights \npupils can be mistreated violently or be influenced by potentially violent beliefs \nbecause the dominant norms and behaviours of the wider society are shared, not \nchallenged, by many adults in the formal education system.  \nWhy are the key international formal institutions of learning socially constructed in \nthis way? Throughout the history of schooling there has always been a conflict \nbetween education for control in order to produce citizens and workers who were \nconformist, passive and politically docile on the one hand and those who wanted to \neducate for critical consciousness, individual liberation and participatory democracy \non the other. It is the contention here that the former has dominated the real world of \nschooling, as opposed to educational debates and theory, because this was the main \nreason that formal, mass schooling systems were established in the first place and then \nexpanded numerically and geographically. Some educational writers, practitioners and \npolicy makers have championed the latter approach to schooling and education in \n 5 \ngeneral but the global persistence of the dominant authoritarian model suggests that \nthe original purpose of control and compliance is deeply embedded in schooling and \nis highly resistant to change as a result.     \n \nGreen\u2019s historical study of the origins of formal schooling systems in England, \nFrance, the United States and Prussia in the nineteenth century argues that a key \npurpose of their construction was the formation and consolidation of national \nconsciousness. Schooling provided a means of social and political control, in \nparticular to counter the threat to the state of increasingly industrialised, urbanised \nand potentially organised working populations. As Green\u2019s study argues, \u2018The task of \npublic schooling was not so much to develop new skills for the industrial sector as to \ninculcate habits of conformity, discipline and morality that would counter the \nwidespread problems of social disorder\u2019 (1990:59). Schooling would be organised to \nprepare future workers with the subordinate values and behaviours necessary for the \nmodern bureaucratic, mass production workplace and the existing social order \u2013 \nregularity, routine, monotonous work and strict discipline. Its organisational form \nwould therefore need to be authoritarian in order to inculcate habits of obedience and \nconformity.  \n \nMoreover, this authoritarianism was also reflected in the curriculum. Kelly (1986) \nargues that historically the dominant epistemology or view of knowledge that has \ninfluenced curriculum planning is \u2018rationalist\u2019, that is that knowledge is certain, \nfactual and objective rather than contentious and subject to change and interpretation. \nThis rationalist view of knowledge stems from European culture at the end of the \neighteenth century, the period of the \u2018Enlightenment\u2019, when the aim was to formulate \n 6 \ngeneral laws based on observation and experiment. He argues that this stress on \ncertainty and the one \u2018right\u2019 answer leads to authoritarianism. This is because if \nknowledge is absolute and unchanging then there cannot be legitimate alternatives to \nit. There is little point in discussion and dialogue as the role of the teacher is to impart \na factual body of knowledge to immature recipients. This means a stress on the \ntransmission of cognitive knowledge, subject content and values as though they were \nfacts over education about values, skills, feelings and relationships. It also means an \nemphasis on teacher-centred learning over enquiry, discussion and critical analysis \u2013 \nand also helps to explain why there seems to be considerable teacher resistance to \nteaching controversial issues in schools.      \n  \nThus through both organisation and curriculum content schooling became one of the \nnew institutions of social control, along with prisons, hospitals and factories, that used \ncontinual surveillance to, in the words of Foucault, \u2018discipline and punish\u2019 in order to \navoid social fragmentation and to create order and docility, \n \n\u2018Is it surprising that the cellular prison, with its regular chronologies, forced labour, it \nauthorities of surveillance and registration, its experts in normality, who continue and \nmultiply the functions of the judge, should have become the modern instrument of \npenality? Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, \nwhich all resemble prisons\u2019 (Foucault,1977:227\/8). \n \nThis authoritarian model of schooling with its origins in state formation, \nmodernisation and social and political control gradually extended globally from \nEuropean societies and Japan through colonisation where the key purpose of \n 7 \nschooling was to help to control indigenous populations for the benefit of the colonial \npower. By the 1930\u2019s colonialism had exercised its sway over 84.6 per cent of the \nland surface of the globe (Loomba,1998:15). When formal education was eventually \nprovided missionary schools and those of the colonial state were used to control local \npopulations by teaching the superiority of the culture of the colonising power and by \nsupplying the subordinate personnel necessary for the effective functioning of the \ncolonial administration (Altbach and Kelly1978). Even if it was not always entirely \nsuccessful in this, and indeed in the end helped to sow the seeds of its own \ndestruction, the organisational style of schooling bequeathed by both the needs of  \nindustrialised  mass production and then colonialism remains as a firm legacy in many \npost-colonial societies. Moreover, this, authoritarian, style, even if not spread directly \nthrough colonisation, was adopted and imitated by other nation states as the only \n\u2018modern\u2019 mass model of education. Subsequently, many post-colonial governments \ndid not hesitate to use schooling for political control purposes of their own.  \n \nSchool organisation and curriculum today still internationally very much reflect their \noriginal historical purposes. \n \nPeace Education \n \nPeace education here is understood generally to aim to offer opportunities to develop \nthe skills, knowledge and values required for the practice of conflict resolution, \ncommunication and co-operation in relation to issues of peace, war, violence, conflict \nand injustice. Peace education can be implemented in societies in conflict, post-\n 8 \nconflict societies and stable societies in order to achieve peaceful problem-solving. \nThus peace education is defined by UNICEF as, \n \n\u2018the process of promoting the knowledge ,skills, attitudes and values needed to bring \nabout behaviour changes that will enable children, youths and adults to prevent \nconflict and violence, both overt and structural; to resolve conflict peacefully; and to \ncreate the conditions conducive to peace, whether at an intra-personal, interpersonal, \ninter-group, national or international level\u2019 (Fountain,1999:1). \n \nAlthough the number of peace education programmes has been increasing in both the \nformal and informal sectors, there have been few empirical studies of peace education \nas they have tended to lack systematic evaluation (Nevo and Brem,2002:271-282; \nFountain,1999:31-37). However, given the aims of peace education, and in the light of \nthe analysis of contemporary schooling presented above, it would seem likely that any \nprogramme of peace education would be different from many other aspects of formal \neducation. This article discusses one empirical study of both an organisation involved \nin peace education and a one term programme of peace education carried out in a \nmulti-ethnic, urban primary school in England (Sakade 2008). The organisation was \nthe West Midlands Quaker Peace Education Project (WMQPEP) and the study used \ninterviews and questionnaires with project workers, teachers and pupils as well as \nparticipant observation of the programme (entitled the \u2018Peace Maker Project\u2019) itself. \nOne important dimension of the research was a comparison between the experiences \nof children on the peace education programme with the rest of their experiences in \nschool, which will be the major theme of the article.  \n \n 9 \nWMQPEP itself understands peace education as promoting the awareness of the nature \nof conflicts (knowledge and attitudes) and providing people with the means (tools and \nskills) of managing conflict without violence. In practice, the learning includes \nhandling conflicts without hurting people and finding peaceful ways of solving \nproblems. This means that peace education is understood as providing alternative \nstrategies to violence in difficult situations (Harris and Morrison, 2003: 28). These \ngeneral ideas of peace education as understood by WMQPEP-  improving human \nrelationships, handling conflicts in peaceful ways and providing necessary knowledge \nand skills relating to peace and conflict - seem to coincide with the definition of peace \neducation put forward by UNICEF above.  \n \nPeace education as understood by WMQPEP not only deals with violent conflicts or \naggressive behaviour but also works on solving problems in peaceful ways and improving \nhuman relationships. It reflects two concepts of peace defined by Galtung (1975:29-30): \n\u2018negative peace\u2019 (\u2018the absence of violence\u2019) achieved by eliminating violent, and \u2018positive \npeace\u2019 (\u2018a pattern of co-operation and integration among people with the absence of both \nphysical violence and injustice\u2019) achieved through co-operative relationships.    \n \nIn understanding WMQPEP\u2019s approach it is also useful to distinguish between education \nfor peace and education about peace. The first, education for peace, aims to improve \npeaceful relations. The second, education about peace, aims to promote awareness of peace \nand conflict and offer the means of conflict resolution in school and the wider world. It also \nincludes knowledge and understanding of conflict theory: its causes, process and effects in \nsocial conditions and in personal relationships.  \n \n 10 \nIn terms of the two concepts of peace defined by Galtung above, WMQPEP\u2019s \nunderstanding of peace education seems to have more emphasis on creating \u2018positive \npeace\u2019 (\u2018a pattern of co-operation and integration among people\u2019) in which peace is built \nthrough co-operative relationship alongside reducing violent behaviour toward \u2018negative \npeace\u2019 (\u2018the absence of violence\u2019). WMQPEP also seems to focus more on education for \nimproving peaceful relationships in practice on a smaller scale than  education to learn \nabout a wider concept of peace and conflict in the world. This is because they stress the \nimportance of building peace in daily life. Experience of peace arises from something that \npeople can relate to. Peace education needs to begin in the context of intra-personal or \ninterpersonal relationships. \n  \nFrom their viewpoint, building peaceful relationships involves emotional literacy, skills \nfor good communication, co-operation and problem-solving, and positive attitudes \ntowards themselves and others (e.g. getting on with each other, learning about each other, \nunderstanding and respecting other people, in particular, from different backgrounds as \nwell as recognising something common to everybody). The project promotes peaceful \nrelationship within a class and hopefully gradually throughout the whole school. \nAlthough the project is only involved in schools, its work also has a positive impact on \nthe improvement of people\u2019s relationships in community and that peaceful relationships \nwill spread further to a wider community in all areas of life (school, family, workplace, \ncommunity and international relations).    \n \nThis emphasis on peaceful relationships in WMQPEP\u2019s understanding of peace \neducation is underpinned by Quaker philosophy, in particular the idea that God is in \nevery person so that it is important to respect and value each individual equally. This is \n 11 \nalso why, considering that children often learn to fail in school and have low self-\nesteem, WMQPEP emphasises the importance of involving everyone in having fun and \nworking together.  \n \nAs well as their belief in peace as Quakers, WMQPEP also sees peace education as a way \nof tackling problems of children\u2019s exposure to fighting, violence and aggression through the \nopportunity for them to learn social skills in daily life experience. Many project workers \nmentioned noticing that children\u2019s learning and growth are often undermined by disruption \nand emotional disturbance caused by bullying or conflict that happen in schools and in their \ndaily lives. They tend to see behavioural problems as consequences of children\u2019s struggle to \ndeal with their strong emotions, negative views on self and others, and a lack of \ncommunication skills. This problem of the effect of negative emotion on children\u2019s learning \nis pointed out by Daniel Goleman in his book, \u2018Emotional Intelligence\u2019 (1995:78-9):  \n \n\u2018Students who are anxious, angry, or depressed don\u2019t learn; people who are caught in \nthese states do not take information effectively or deal with it well\u2026powerful \nnegative emotions twist attention toward their own preoccupations, interfering with \nthe attempt to focus elsewhere\u2026When emotion overwhelm concentration, what is \nbeing swamped is the mental capacity cognitive scientists call \u201cworking memory\u201d, \nthe ability to hold in mind all information relevant to the task at hand\u2026On the other \nhand, consider the role of positive motivation \u2013 the marshalling of feelings of \nenthusiasm, zeal, and confidence \u2013 in achievement.\u2019  \n \nWMQPEP started peace education in schools in England two decades ago to enable \nchildren to deal with problems or challenging situations by themselves, in particular, \n 12 \nthrough providing them with opportunity to develop their self-esteem and confidence. It \nwas seen as important for children to learn non-aggressive approaches to problems as \nalternative experiences to fighting and to develop peaceful relationships while creating a \nsafe and peaceful learning environment where the children feel happy and fulfil their \npotential.  \n \nMethods \nThe researcher, one of the authors who is not a project worker, adopted a case study \napproach to portray and investigate an existing peace education organisation and one of \nits projects in a primary school with a view to understanding the principles and the \npractice of peace education in school as well as exploring its impact. The study also \nconcerns a potential tension between the principles and practice of existing peace \neducation, and those of schools where the peace education is practised, considering that \nschools can be seen as places where structural violence is exercised as a means of social \ncontrol to reproduce existing unequal power relationship in social structures (Apple, \n1982).  \n \nThe research focused on two samples as subjects of the study: one organisation - West \nMidlands Quaker Peace Education Project (WMQPEP), and one state urban primary \nschool, where WMQPEP has run its ten-week peace education programme which \npromotes peacemaking skills (co-operation, communication, affirmation and problem-\nsolving skills) based on a Circle Time model and child-centred, experience-based learning \n(i.e. co-operative games and activities) facilitated by project workers. WMQPEP was \nchosen as a case study for its long lasting active work on peace education in schools. To \nunderstand the principles and practice of peace education carried out by the WMQPEP, \n 13 \nthe research used short questionnaires and more in-depth semi-structured interviews with \nthe project manager and 7 project workers. \n \nA particular school was chosen since it was one of the schools where WMQPEP has been \nactive (the school had had the programme for over 5 years), and it has common \ncharacteristics of many urban schools in England (e.g. multi-ethnic composition, high \ntransience rate among pupils). Along with participant observation of the ten-week \nprogramme by the researcher and interviews with school staff to ask about their previous \nexperience of the programme, the research also conducted interviews with the class \nteacher and a series of small group interviews with a whole class of about 30 pupils who \nparticipated in the programme, with the aim of exploring their perceptions of the \nprogramme and its impact and of comparing the findings with the aims and expected \noutcomes of the programme (see appendix for interview questions).  \n \nDifferences Between Schooling and Peace Education  \n \nWhile the key historical purposes of schooling remain dominant globally, as the study \ntook place in England it is necessary to note briefly some key contemporary features \nof education in England as relevant background to the findings which are discussed \nbelow. England possesses a very detailed, content-laden and centralised national \ncurriculum for both primary and secondary education. This is tested at four key stages \n\u2013 age7, 11, 14 and 16 \u2013 though the wider effect of this is to make English children \namong the most tested in the world (Alexander 2000; Harber 2004:Ch.8). The key \npurpose of such tests is not diagnostic for the benefit of the pupils but to provide \nstatistical information about schools so that they can be ranked in league tables and \n 14 \nparents can choose between schools in a quasi-market. Pupils therefore have little say \nover curriculum content or teaching methods, are not on the whole represented on \nschool governing bodies and do not play a very significant role in school decision-\nmaking (Harber 2009). Schools are inspected against set targets in the context of a \ndiscourse of school \u2018failure\u2019 and putting schools in \u2018special measures\u2019. Not \nsurprisingly, many teachers find such inspections threatening and stressful. As \ncorporal punishment was finally legally abolished in 1999, the dominant \norganisational nature of English schooling can perhaps best be summarised as \n\u2018friendly or benevolent authoritarian\u2019, though failure to address widespread bullying \nsufficiently and the physical and emotional effects of hyper-testing are two more \nserious negative aspects.  \n \nThe selection below will summarise some of the data gathered by the researcher that \nindicates some of the key differences between peace education and \u2018normal\u2019 \nschooling.  \n \n\u2022 Relationships between adults and children \nConsidering these current conditions of schooling in England, there are many examples of \ncontrasts between \u2018normal\u2019 schooling and peace education that can be found in the \nexperiences of WMQPEP project workers, pupils and teachers in carrying out the Peace \nMaker Project in the case study school. The project workers, for example, perceived their \nrelationships with children as very different from those of teachers. Several project \nworkers commented about the difference between teachers\u2019 control over children and \nchildren\u2019s self-control over their action: \n \n 15 \n\u2018It\u2019s very different relationship to that of the teacher. I\u2019m an ex-teacher and I really \nhave to modify the way that I used to work with youngsters where control was \nabsolutely essential in a particular kind of way because you\u2019ve got educational targets \nto hit. And with these, I pull much more from my experience of a drama workshop \nleader.\u2019  \n \n\u2018Sometimes teachers think that they have to keep their distance from children \nwhereas in Circle Time (a period of time outside normal lessons where children and \nteachers sit in a circle to exchange views in a non-didactic manner) everyone is equal \nwithin a circle. Some teachers are really concerned about that as they think that if \nthey don\u2019t remain the boss, children are going to run riot. But when they see how it \ndoes work by changing their teaching methods around, at the end of 10 weeks, they \nrealise that it does work and children still do respect the teacher. I think that if \nteachers control children all the time, they are never going to learn self-discipline.\u2019 \n  \n\u2022 The role of a project worker and that of a teacher \n \nMany project workers also made similar comments about the role of teacher as controller, \nwhich differs from that of a project worker as a facilitator who encourages children to \ncontrol themselves, to keep rules set up by themselves and to take responsibility for their \nown behaviour:  \n \n\u2018We don\u2019t shout at them and we have more choices and a right to pass. I think that \nour role is very different from a role of a teacher where you do what you are told. I \nthink that rules are quite important. Actually you\u2019re not working to your rules, \n 16 \nyou\u2019re working to the rules that children set in Circle Time. Once you have those \nboundaries, my role as a facilitator is like a referee in football. The rules are there \nand all you\u2019re doing is keeping the rules.  \n \n\u2018We try to encourage the group to exercise self-control. So they are doing the \ncontrolling because they want to get more activities and games into the time. So \nthey see a reason for co-operating and behaving well.\u2019  \n \n\u2018I would like to see myself being as a facilitator of the group, not the controller. If \nthe group is working very badly together, I would like to think that I would be able \nto say something like, \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s really hard for us to get on with each other \nthis afternoon. I wonder what\u2019s going on. I wonder what\u2019s happening.\u201d And to try \nand help the children think about their relationships with each other, and begin to \noffer ideas about what they could do about it. I have observed a teacher as a \ncontroller, I think that the teacher in that situation would identify particular \nchildren as trouble makers, and would ask those children to stop doing what they \nare doing or to leave the group. So that would be a fundamental difference.\u2019  \n\u2022 Approaches to teaching and learning \nIn order to ensure that children learn to control the situation by themselves, one project \nworker emphasised the important role of facilitating children to come up with their own \nunderstanding of their experiences:  \n \n\u2018Other things in terms of teaching in some of the work, particularly to do with \nconflict management, are didactic, which means that I\u2019m imparting knowledge or \nideas to them, for example, conflict escalator or anger rules...But most of the time, \n 17 \nI would hope that my teaching style, or rather the way of encouraging them to \nlearn, is through their experiencing. So having experiences and then facilitating the \nchildren to try and understand their experiences and to come up with their own \nunderstanding of their experiences. So I suppose those are the two main ways.\u2019  \n \nIn order to draw out children\u2019s own understanding of their experiences in conflict \nsituations, the same project worker described a practical approach in which children are \nnot told off but are asked questions to reflect on the situation:  \n \n\u2018I hope to have a non-punitive but questioning approach to conflict so that if \nchildren in a class do get into conflict or the whole group gets into conflict, I would \nhope to say, \u2018I wonder what\u2019s going on. Can anybody tell me what\u2019s happening?\u2019 \nSo I ask them those questions for them to observe and to reflect on what\u2019s \nhappening instead of telling them off.\u2019  \n \nAnother project worker said that teachers are asked to support and understand the \nprinciple of self-regulation within the group and to trust children\u2019s learning process:  \n \n\u2018And also teachers are asked at the beginning of each project if they will in effect \nsit on their hands when they become part of the circle, and not intervene. If there \nare disciplinary problems coming up, we try to resolve them as a group. A teacher \ndoesn\u2019t come in as a teacher because that would completely destroy the atmosphere \nthat we try to create. Always at the introductory meeting with teachers, we try to \nalert them what to expect if it\u2019s the first time they go through Peacemakers, and to \nencourage them to trust the process that we go though with the youngsters, actually \n 18 \nwill work if you let it happen. Because teachers often have to jump in at a first sign \nof trouble, they can\u2019t wait for the group to self-regulate whereas we can. We are \nhelping the group self-regulate.\u2019  \n \nSeveral project workers pointed out that teachers were governed by educational and \ndisciplinary targets whereas project workers have more flexibility to respond to the need \nor the mood of children at that moment: \n \n\u2018Teachers have targets in the National Curriculum and discipline, and they also \nhave ultimate discipline to the children who are particularly difficult in order to get \non with the class. They are more directed to that. But we can set up our own \nprogrammes and can be more flexible with delivering the programme each time \naccording to children\u2019s condition.  \n \n\u2018Although I might have an idea in my head about what I would like them to learn \nor what the main focus of the session to be, I can\u2019t predict before I go in that \nafternoon exactly what\u2019s going to happen. So I might\u2019ve decided, for example, I \ndid set the learning outcome and as a teacher I might\u2019ve said, \u201cBy the end of this \nafternoon, you would all have learned anger rules. That\u2019s your learning \noutcome\u2026\u201d But I might go in and I might realise that the actual state of the class \nwas such that they just do not concentrate on that issue. There was much more \nimportant things to discuss. If I had my leaning outcome and if I set outcomes, I \nwould be constantly trying to get back to it in order to achieve the outcome. If I \ndon\u2019t set outcomes, it gives me that flexibility to respond to the need or the mood \nof the class that afternoon.\u2019 \n 19 \n \nOne project worker also made a similar comment that teachers work towards targets and \nlearning outcomes while project workers help children deal with their problems: \n \n\u2018In another way, my role is to enable children to find their solutions to their \nproblems rather than having a learning outcome which they have to achieve. \nParticularly at the moment in education, it\u2019s very oriented on target setting, and \nit\u2019s very oriented on learning outcomes. So teachers\u2019 job by and large would be \nto make sure that children have achieved their learning outcome. I don\u2019t set \noutcomes, and therefore, I\u2019m different from a teacher.\u2019 \n \nThe same project worker also pointed out that if children are told what their learning \noutcomes should be, they are given a passive mentality of being told what they are meant \nto do. This also creates the condition where children have experience of failure:  \n \n\u2018In some schools in all the core lessons; English, Maths and Science, children are \nactually told what their outcome is for that lesson so it would be written up on \nthe board and they are writing in their books, like \u201cBy the end of today, you will \nknow how to do this and this\u2026.\u201d So I think that gives the children a whole \nmentality of being told what they are meant to be learning, and then being able to \njudge whether they have achieved that learning or not, and therefore, whether \nthey are successful or not successful. I don\u2019t do that, so that is another major \ndifference.  \n \n 20 \n\u2018If I set targets or gave children the outcomes\u2026 some people might say that would \nbe perfect because that gives them something to work towards, gives them a \nchallenge, and tells them what exactly I want them to do. However, my concern \nwith that is that there may be children who have found it really hard for all sorts of \nreasons. Then they are failing to do it and feeling that they failed because they \nhaven\u2019t done what I wanted them to do, or they are doing it because they want to \nplease me and get a smiley face or something. But actually it\u2019s very superficial \nbecause they\u2019ve done it for me that afternoon, but actually they don\u2019t really want to \ndo it.\u2019  \n \nProject workers\u2019 therefore generally see their relationships with children as friendly, \ninformal, not authoritarian, and more equal compared with teachers\u2019 relationships. \nWMQPEP emphasises the importance of building supportive and trusting relationship \nrather than imposing external discipline and rules to maintain hierarchy in the education \nsystem. WMQPEP thinks that it is important for teachers to learn the approach used in \nthe project and reinforce the principles in classroom since teachers can make can a big \ndifference in making children more aware of the principles on a daily basis. \u2026. \n \n\u2022 Issues and challenges facing peace education \n \nHowever, the overall educational context of teachers within formal schooling makes this \nmuch more difficult. One project worker, for example, said that peace education was not \nprioritised in schools because it was not part of National Curriculum and that some \nschools found it difficult to connect peace education to the rest of the curriculum:  \n \n 21 \n\u2018Another problem is that peace education is not part of National Curriculum so it\u2019s \nnot assessed or reported on. Peace education is not generally perceived as helpful \nin getting good inspection outcomes... It is also not easily connected to the rest of \nschool curriculum in some schools.\u2019 \n \nMany project workers noticed, as another major problem, that schools often have \ndifficulty in finding time for peace education: \n \n\u2018I think it\u2019s the time to fit it all in. I think that the curriculum is so heavily loaded. \nSo it\u2019s very difficult for them to give up 10 afternoons, which for some schools \nthey think it\u2019s worth it while other schools might not think that they could give up \nthat amount of time\u2026 Each school should have Circle Time on the timetable, but \nanything gets squeezed out, if the week is busy, it would be Music, PE or Circle \nTime that goes, but Circle Time should be there.\u2019  \n \n\u2018Teacher overload means there is no time available for peace education, in \nparticular, peace education is not seen as high enough priority, and the \ncurriculum is also overloaded so there is no room for peace education.\u2019 \n \nFurthermore, several project workers pointed out that the current situation in schools \nmakes it difficult for teachers to use the same approach in the classroom because of \nthe pressure of meeting educational targets in limited time:  \n \n\u2018I think it\u2019s difficult for teachers to use the same approach in classroom. I don\u2019t \nthink it\u2019s impossible but it\u2019s more difficult because it takes more time. I think that \n 22 \none thing that teachers don\u2019t have anymore is time. Everything is in such a rush to \ncram everything in. It\u2019s quicker to tell somebody rather than asking what they \nshould be doing, but in a long term, it would be better to take time so that the \nchild can do it by themselves. In a long term, it\u2019s worth it. I think that some \nteachers lose sight of that in their hurry to get things done.\u2019 \n \nOn the other hand, one project worker also said that finding time might be a problem but  \nthere were also often other reasons relating to teachers\u2019 values or a lack of knowledge \nabout peace education:  \n \n\u2018One of problems would be where they can fit it into the timetable. It\u2019s very \ndifficult at secondary schools. At primary schools, sometimes it\u2019s difficult, \ndepending on how committed the school are. I think they could fit it in. It depends \non their values or teachers not knowing what is about because they haven\u2019t been \ntrained and they feel uncomfortable with it.\u2019  \n \nSimilarly, another project worker mentioned that there was a lack of understanding or \nknowledge of peace education in schools: \n \n\u2018Some of the problems are misunderstandings because some schools think that all \npeace educators are peace activist\u2026 There is lack of knowledge about what \npeace education really is, both education about peace and education for peace. \nPeace education is often perceived as slightly weird, off-beat or threatening.\u2019  \n \n 23 \nSeveral project workers commented that peace education is often contrary to school ethos \nin terms of structures, customs and teaching methods. Sometimes peace education is seen \nas a threat to the existing hierarchy in schools and also peace education does not work \nwell in a hierarchical and punitive school ethos:  \n \n\u2018Peace education is contrary to school ethos in some schools. Some of the problems \nfacing peace education in schools relate to the structures and customs in schools. \nSome professionals are actually afraid that to question the underlying assumptions \nof the structure will lead to anarchy. In peace education, we do encourage the \npupils to question and put forward new ideas. This is seen as potentially \nthreatening to the existing hierarchy.  \n \nThe other problem that peace education faces is the ethos of the school. So if the \nethos of the school is one where children are told what to do and children\u2019s views \nare not held to be important, then peace education is not working very well... In \nschools that have a very strict hierarchy where a Head Teacher tells senior \nmanagers what to do, senior managers tell teachers what to do, teachers tell \nchildren what to do, and nobody listens to people who are below them, I\u2019m not \ngoing to find that education is very easy or peace education work is not found \neasier.\u2019  \n \nOne of the project workers also noted some aspects of school ethos which are in accord \nwith peace education: \n \n 24 \n\u2018Peace education will work better in a school which already values children\u2019s \nopinions about themselves, about each other, about members of the school staff, \nand also in a school that has an emphasis on what is called \u201cpositive behavioural \nmanagement\u201d, which is helping children to change behaviour by giving them \npositive incentives rather than punishments.\u2019 \n \n\u2022 Pupils\u2019 perceptions of the project in relation to normal lessons \n \nPupils were also asked whether the project was different from normal lessons. One pupil \nsaid:  \n  \n\u2018Yes. You played games all the time and also learned how to respect others.\u2019  \n \nAnother pupil said, being different from normal lessons, in the project:   \n \n\u2018We were allowed to express our true feelings.\u2019 \n \nOverall, many pupils thought that the Peace Maker Project was different from normal \nlessons because: \u2018In the Peacemakers, there is no test and you don\u2019t use papers and pens \nmuch because you don\u2019t need it and you get up and do something\u2019 and \u2018we play games and \ntalk\u2019, but \u2018in normal lesson, we don\u2019t get to play games and we don\u2019t get up\u2019. One pupil \nthought that \u2018the Peacemakers is more fun. In normal lesson, you have to learn maths or \nliteracy and sometimes they are boring because you just have to sit down and concentrate.\u2019 \nSimilarly, other pupils said, \u2018it was fun\u2019, \u2018more active\u2019 and \u2018it stimulates your brain\u2019.  \n \n 25 \nSeveral pupils mentioned that \u2018working in a team as a class\u2019 is different from normal \nlessons:  \n \n\u2018We learnt something which you had never been taught in normal class. I liked the team \nwork when we moved the chairs around, and you learned to be patient. For the first \ntime, the Peacemakers was hard, from the second time, we were slightly improving in \nworking together.\u2019 \n \nMany pupils also thought that the project provided the opportunity for getting to know their \nclassmates:  \n \n\u2018You learned more about your classmates, which you don\u2019t do in other lessons. It\u2019s a \ngood thing.\u2019  \n \n\u2018You got to know more about your friends, that you never knew before.\u2019 \n \n\u2018Because we were sitting in a circle, we got to know our class much better. In normal \nlessons, we get on with our work and just have the same people on the table.\u2019  \n \nSome pupils thought that normal lessons don\u2019t teach them to \u2018trust people\u2019: \n \n\u2018You can talk about problems to somebody else. When you need help, you don\u2019t have \nto be alone. You have some people to talk to.\u2019  \n \nSeveral pupils said that learning about fighting is different from normal lessons:  \n 26 \n \n \n\u2018It teaches to protect yourself when somebody else is fighting. It is always annoying but \nif you fight, you get hurt.\u2019  \n \n\u2018Teachers don\u2019t teach anything about fighting.\u2019 \n \n\u2018We learned not to fight or to stop it.\u2019 \n \n\u2018Be strong and try not to pick a fight with someone.\u2019 \n \n \nOn the other hand, pupils also thought that they learned some things which are useful in \nnormal lessons, in particular, good communication and self-confidence such as \u2018listening to \nsomeone who is talking\u2019, \u2018paying attention to the teacher\u2019, \u2018not shouting\u2019 \u2018eye-contacting\u2019 \nand \u2018courage to put your hand up (even if you think it might be wrong)\u2019 as well as co-\noperation such as \u2018be happy who you work together with \u2013 don\u2019t complain, working quietly, \nbe calm\u2019, \u2018to work with different people even though they are boys\u2019 and \u2018try to get on with \npeople even in your normal lesson.\u2019 They also seem to have learned appropriate attitudes in \nnormal lessons such as \u2018not fidgeting\u2019, \u2018sitting nicely\u2019, \u2018stop talking to other people and \ndisturbing them\u2019 and \u2018ignore people who are bothering you\u2019.  \n\u2022 Teacher\u2019s perceptions of the project in relation to normal teaching  \n \nThe teacher was also asked whether there are any different or similar approaches to normal \nteaching in the project, and whether there are any particular aspects of teaching methods \n 27 \nthat can be used in normal lessons. The teacher thought that the emphasis on positives in the \napproach of the project is similar to the school\u2019s behavioural management:   \n \n\u2018Positive ways of behavioural management are similar. We give them lots of smiley \nfaces instead of sad faces. If they get sad faces, it means it\u2019s very serious.\u2019 \n \nHowever, perceiving that the project worker\u2019s relationship with the pupils is more informal \nthan that of a teacher, the teacher didn\u2019t think that it works in normal lessons which require \ncontrol over the pupils in order to meet many targets within limited time:  \n \n\u2018Compared to teachers, the project worker and the children have more informal \nrelationships. Certainly, they were always looking forward to the Peacemakers and I \nnoticed that whenever they saw the project worker, they were ready to run up to chat to \nher. And also she never told them off. As a teacher, you still need to have that control. \nAnd you can\u2019t have that time to keep stopping because I\u2019ve got a list of things we\u2019ve \ngot to get through in lessons.\u2019    \n \nThe teacher thought that some aspects of the project could be useful in normal lessons as \nmodels of good behaviour:  \n \n\u2018If you explore issues in the Peacemakers, and if you are in the middle of numeracy or \nother lessons and something happens, you could always refer back to the Peacemakers, \nsuch as models of good behaviour, how we treat other people, and how we teach each \nother. I think it has value even though it\u2019s kind of separate in order to refer back to it. \nLike today in one class, when somebody said an answer that was incorrect and some \n 28 \npeople laughed. I was shocked. This is something we usually have to tell them not to \ndo. So I was surprised. That would be something perhaps to pull out of the \nPeacemakers, asking like, \u201cDo you remember how we talked about and how it\u2019s nice \nwhen you were sitting in the middle and everybody says how good you are? You don\u2019t \nwant to laugh at each other.\u201d  \n \nThe teacher also thought that the way that the class made rules for themselves in the project \nwould be useful in normal lessons: \n \n\u2018And also the rules of the Peacemakers such as good listening, helping each other and \nso on. They could be out up on the wall in order to refer to in any lessons.\u2019   \n \nHowever, a continuing fundamental problem was the national curriculum and the way it had \nchanged relationships with pupils, \n \n\u2018I have to say, because of the reason of the curriculum, we don\u2019t have much time with \nchildren anymore. I used to spend a lot more time talking with the children in a more \ninformal way when I didn\u2019t have to get through a whole lot of literacy lessons. These \nlessons actually stop me from talking to the children. I used to know the children better\u2019.   \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThis article has used empirical data from England to explore tensions and contradictions \nbetween the aims and practices of peace education and the existing structures and processes \n 29 \nof formal education. Similar tensions and contradictions exist in relation to the recently \nintroduced subject of citizenship education (Harber 2002). Too often, because of their \nhistorical and contemporary imperatives, schools can be dehumanising institutions that \nstress cognitive forms of knowledge over the affective and which play down important \ninter-personal skills of the sort that the project described in this article tries to achieve. This \ndoesn\u2019t negate the need to try and to acknowledge and celebrate successful courses when \nthey occur but such courses do also tend to reveal significant and contrasting ideologies of \npractice. They also beg questions of the extent to which education for peace can ever be \ntruly compatible with, or comfortably coexist with, formal education as currently \nconstructed in many parts of the world.  \n \nReferences \n \nAlexander,R.
