J. Gordon Melton, from a predominantly\nhistory of religions perspective, sees outsider status and tensions with the\nmainstream as a primary defining characteristic of NRMs. He also\nargues that NRMs may have more in common with the traditions from\nwhich they derive than with other NRMs; hence, he effectively rejects\nthe idea that NRMs can be defined by a set of common shared charac-\nteristics. Thomas Robbins, picking up on themes in both essays, argues\nthat chronology and outsider status should be conceptually separated in\ndifferentiating between \u201cnew\u201d and \u201calternative.\u201d1\nWhile Barker and Melton make some reference to non-Western con-\ntexts, their essays, perhaps unsurprisingly, focus largely on Western con-\ntexts. David Bromley\u2019s advocacy of a new field (new religions studies,\nNRS) speaks of the rise of NRMs in the context of Western history, and\nMelton uses a Western typology (church-sect-new religion) that does not\ntranslate readily into other (for example, Asian) contexts.2 Yet, if the\nstudy of NRMs is to extend beyond the Western context, one needs to:\n1) look equally closely at other geographical and cultural settings in\nwhich NRMs are found; 2) consider how NRMs may be defined and\nperceived in non-Western contexts; and 3) ask what lessons this might\nhave for formulating broader understandings, concepts, and theoretical\nframeworks in the global context. As Asian colleagues remind us, the\n\u201cWest\u201d is a minority population in a much wider world; hence, one\nshould not assume that the West is necessarily the most appropriate\narena within which to formulate theoretical models to apply to the rest\nof the world. \nIn this respect the example of Japan may be of value, because there\none finds a widely used term, shin sh\u00fbky\u00f4, that is generally translated in\nEnglish by the phrases \u201cnew religion\u201d and \u201cnew religious movement,\u201d3\nalong with an academic field at least as well-developed as the study of\nNRMs in the West. Moreover, the study of NRMs has been embedded in\nthe wider field of Religious Studies in Japan. Japanese scholars such as\nShimazono Susumu and Inoue Nobutaka4 have done historical research\non nineteenth-century NRMs and produced sociologically based studies\nof more recent NRMs leading to a rather different approach to notions\nof chronological newness evident in, for example, Barker\u2019s essay.5 The\nJapanese field presents examples of a large number of movements that\nacademics classify as NRMs, many having considerable influence in\nJapan6 and a sizeable segment of the population (estimated by some to\nbe around 20 percent) that belongs or has belonged to them. Many\nNRMs in Japan have combined to form an organization, Shin Nihon\nSh\u00fbky\u00f4 Dantai Reng\u00f4kai (Shinsh\u00fbren) or Federation of New Religious\nOrganizations of Japan,7 to represent their interests. All this indicates\nhow significant NRMs are in the Japanese religious landscape, raising\nquestions about the extent to which this contradicts the seemingly mar-\nginalized situation of NRMs in the West. In Japan there are movements\nReader: Japanese New Religious Movements\n85\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 85\nscholars classify as \u201cnew\u201d that are a century or more old as well as move-\nments classed as \u201cnew\u201d that have become linked to the centers of power.\nHence, Japan offers an interesting context in which to look at Barker\u2019s\ndefinitional framework centering on the new, and Melton\u2019s emphasis on\noutsider or alternative status. \nTHE NEW AND THE ALTERNATIVE: DEFINITIONAL\nCONSIDERATIONS\nThe term shin sh\u00fbky\u00f4 emerged in post-war Japan, especially from the\nlate 1950s on, as an alternative to an earlier, implicitly pejorative vocab-\nulary. In the first half of the twentieth century, what academics and\nJapanese media now call shin sh\u00fbky\u00f4 were widely referred to as either\nruiji sh\u00fbky\u00f4 (quasi-religions) or jaky\u00f4 (false religions), and from the late\n1940s shink\u00f4 sh\u00fbky\u00f4 (newly arisen religions), an implicitly derogatory\nterm implying transience, suddenness and lack of substance. The earlier,\nprejudicial language indicated the extent to which NRMs in Japan were\ndepicted as ephemeral, marginal, outsider groups.8 These movements\nstood in contrast to mainstream, established religions\u2014Buddhism and\nShinto\u2014with documented, textual histories in Japan spanning more\nthan a millennium and with normative elements in the social structure\nof Japanese religion, particularly in terms of rites of passage and social\nand household affiliations. It should be noted that Christianity is gen-\nerally not perceived as an NRM or an outsider religion, even though it\nis effectively so in Japan; rather, it is viewed as \u201cestablished\u201d because of\nits associations with the Western mainstream. \nThe shift in terminology from \u201cfalse\u201d (ruiji) to \u201cnew\u201d (shin) indicates\nthat \u201cnew religions\u201d (shin sh\u00fbky\u00f4) in recent decades have attained greater\nrespectability in academia and the media, although shin retains nuances\nof alternative\/outsider status, for in reality shin sh\u00fbky\u00f4 stands in contrast\nto kisei sh\u00fbky\u00f4 (established religions) of Shinto and Buddhism. This indi-\ncates that notions of alternative\/outsider status are important in terms\nof conceptualizing and defining the \u201cnew.\u201d \nWhile this underlines Melton\u2019s point about outsider status being a\ndefining characteristic of NRMs, it does not obviate the importance of\n\u201cnewness\u201d as a factor in defining NRMs in Japan. Being \u201cnew\u201d is very\nmuch related to chronological frameworks, albeit ones linked not so\nmuch to first-generation membership but to broader historical con-\ncepts relating to the modern era in Japan. This period spans the 1868\nMeiji Restoration to the present, an era whose origins are linked to the\nfirst half of the nineteenth-century when feudalism in the Tokugawa\nregime (1600\u20131868) was collapsing and a modern nation-state was\nemerging. From this period, NRMs as independent, doctrinally framed\nentities with their own infrastructures began to appear. Thus, in histor-\nical terms, NRMs in Japan have emerged outside of, and alternative to,\nNova Religio\n86\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 86\nthe mainstream, in conjunction with and in response to emergent\nmodernity and the modern nation-state. The association with modernity\nis a defining indicator of the \u201cnew\u201d in the context of Japanese NRMs.\nJapanese and Western scholars generally classify early nineteenth-\ncentury movements such as Konk\u00f4ky\u00f4, Kurozumiky\u00f4, and Tenriky\u00f4 as\nNRMs, just as they do late twentieth-century groups such as Mahikari,\nAgonsh\u00fb, K\u00f4fuku no Kagaku, and Shinnyo-en.9\nOn the surface, such classifications seem to suggest that Barker\u2019s\nemphasis on \u201cbeing new\u201d (i.e. first-generation membership) as a dis-\ntinguishing characteristic of NRMs is problematic in Japan, and to an\nextent this is so. However, one should add the caveat that, in the\nJapanese historical context, \u201cnewness\u201d is not limited to movements of\njust first- or second-generation adherents but, as cited above, relates to\nan association with modernity as well as with the comparative dimen-\nsions of historical experience. When viewed against the extensive back-\ndrop of Japanese religious history, with its textually documented orga-\nnizational structures dating back a millennium and a half, a 150-year-old\nreligion such as Tenriky\u00f4 looks new compared to mainstream Buddhist\nsects such as Tendai or Shingon founded in the early ninth century.\n\u201cNewness,\u201d in other words, can be a subjective concept that needs to be\nassessed within the historical culture in which it occurs. Japanese NRMs\nare identifiable as \u201cnew\u201d because of their common emergence with\nmodernity and in contrast to traditions with millennium-old organiza-\ntional histories.\nThe \u201cnew\u201d of \u201cnew religious movements\u201d in Japan relates both to\ntheir chronologies and their alternative natures. Thus Robbins\u2019 argu-\nment for restricting NRM designation \u201cto groups that are actually organi-\nzationally and chronologically new\u201d (Robbins\u2019 emphasis), and for making\na distinction between new religions and alternative religions (portrayed\nas movements \u201c\u2018misaligned\u2019 with dominant cultural and institutional\npatterns\u201d)10 does not work in Japan, and may well be questionable in\nother cultures with similar conditions of modernity or historical patterns\nof religious formation. \nJapanese movements identified as alternative or outside the main-\nstream are rarely able to amend that status, at least not without extended\nhistorical development. Rather, they continue to be seen as outsider\ngroups even while seemingly becoming \u201cestablished\u201d as they age, devel-\noping multi-generational memberships, and even acquiring social or\npolitical power. This can be seen in S\u00f4ka Gakkai, which continues to be\nwidely regarded with suspicion, contrary to Melton\u2019s comments that it\nis now \u201cpart of the religious establishment\u201d11 because of its association\nwith a rising political party. Such suspicion was evident in the aftermath\nof the Aum affair when it was widely recognized that the 1996 revisions\nto the Religious Corporations Law, seemingly designed to guard against\n\u201cfuture Aums,\u201d were primarily enacted with an eye to maintaining\nReader: Japanese New Religious Movements\n87\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 87\ncontrol over S\u00f4ka Gakkai. Indeed, the very fact that S\u00f4ka Gakkai has a\nsizeable membership and has moved close to power centers may well\nhave increased public disquiet. S\u00f4ka Gakkai provides evidence that\nNRMs can attain mass support and a political power base while retain-\ning an aura of marginality in their public images. \nBroad Categories, Generational Differences and Their Values\nJapanese studies identify NRMs in Japan as a coherent group of\nmovements emerging at different periods within the past 150 years and\nhaving variations within this broad category, in particular with regard to\ntheir different periods of formation. Also, regional variations relate to\ntemporal periods; for example, nineteenth-century NRMs more com-\nmonly sprouted in rural, western Japan, whereas during the 1920s and\n1930s NRMs emerged in urban Japan, especially Tokyo. While this focus\non periods of formation might appear confusing, it provides scope for\nmore nuanced understandings of NRM formation and development\nover time. By analyzing NRMs into generations and periods, Japanese\nscholars have: 1) recognized that NRMs should not be limited to\nchronologically new or first- (and perhaps second-) generation move-\nments; 2) identified NRMs as a broad category with multiple, variegated\nfactors such as era and region; and 3) created frameworks for develop-\ning greater understandings of processes that occur as chronologically\n\u201cnew\u201d movements move forward from first-generation memberships\nand leaderships.\nConceptual Unities and Common Characteristics\nScholars of Japanese NRMs generally agree that these NRMs share\ncommon ground as alternative movements that emerged in the modern\nera, as well as a number of characteristics that, while not uniform or\nfound in the same degree in every case, occur widely enough to serve as\ndefining characteristics of NRMs in Japan. These involve structural and\nconceptual commonalities. In structural terms, in contrast with estab-\nlished traditions\u2019 emphasis on the role and status of ordained priests,\nNRMs in Japan are usually lay-centered movements with ordinary mem-\nbers empowered to act as proselytizing agents, which has promoted the\nrapid growth of many NRMs. \nThis emphasis on the laity departs from established hierarchical,\nordained authority frameworks in Japan. NRM leadership patterns ini-\ntially center not on office (i.e. priestly ordination), which typifies\nBuddhism and Shinto, but on charismatic self-selection by founders\nwhose authority emerges from their ability to attract followers through\nspiritual healing, revelation of new teachings, and serving as interme-\ndiaries between the lay membership and spiritual realms. Since much\nNova Religio\n88\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 88\nattention has been given to the study of charismatic leadership in\nJapan,12 as elsewhere with regard to NRMs, I shall not comment further\non this issue here, save to note that those interested in issues of the trans-\nmission and transference of charismatic authority after the demise of\nfounders would find much of interest in the ways in which Japanese\nNRMs seek to ensure that such authority endures beyond the life of the\nfounder. For instance, there are numerous examples of movements\nseeking to keep this power alive through affirming the deceased\nfounder\u2019s continuing presence at sacred centers. Nakayama Miki of\nTenriky\u00f4 is believed to remain present at Tenri and to oversee the move-\nment. The spirit of Goi Masahisa of Byakk\u00f4 Shink\u00f4kai is channelled by\nhis successor, Saionji Masami, into whom he descends to communicate\nwith the faithful. The founder\u2019s revelatory teachings may be system-\natized into canonical writings bearing the leader\u2019s charismatic influ-\nence, and a mausoleum may become a sacred center of pilgrimage (e.g.\nBentensh\u00fb and Ennoky\u00f4). Commonly, NRMs in Japan seek to retain\ncharismatic leadership through familial succession, as in Rissh\u00f4 K\u00f4seikai,\nOomoto, and Shinnyo-en. When a suitable heir is not available in the\nblood family, a gifted disciple may be taken into the founder\u2019s house-\nhold as a y\u00f4shi (adopted daughter or son), who then inherits leadership\nand passes it on within the family.\nNRMs in Japan also create new sacred geographies through the\nbuilding of holy centers imbued with cosmic significance, either linked\nto the founder or as a sign of new beginnings while restoring past spir-\nitual glories. Thus Tenriky\u00f4\u2019s sacred center is located where Nakayama\nMiki was born and founded her religion, where, according to Tenriky\u00f4\u2019s\ncosmology, God the Parent created humanity, and where the nurturing\nnectar of heaven falls to Earth. Agonsh\u00fb describes its sacred center at\nYamashina near Kyoto as the \u201cnew Sahet Mahet\u201d (the location in India\nof the first Buddhist monastery) where it will fulfill its proclaimed mis-\nsion to restore original Buddhism and transform the world.13\nLinked with such structural characteristics are a number of concepts\nthat, as Helen Hardacre argues in her study of the Shinto-derived NRM\nKurozumiky\u00f4, provide a unity to NRMs as a whole. Hardacre\u2019s analysis\ncenters on Japanese NRMs\u2019 \u201cvitalist, spiritualist worldview,\u201d the role of\nthe individual in relation to the world, and the concept of self-cultivation\nas a means to control personal destiny.14 Although Hardacre\u2019s analysis\nwas based on one of the oldest of the Japanese NRMs, she argues that it\ncan be used across the board with regard to Japanese NRMs, a point with\nwhich I readily agree. Late twentieth-century movements manifest sim-\nilar orientations. Agonsh\u00fb, for example, highlights the individual\u2019s rela-\ntion to illness, karma, the ancestors, and world problems, and empha-\nsizes personal cultivation via spiritual practices to \u201ccut one\u2019s karma,\u201d be\nfreed from spiritual hindrances, and attain salvation.15 Other scholars\nreplicate Hardacre\u2019s conceptual unity argument, even if they do not use\nReader: Japanese New Religious Movements\n89\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 89\nthe same individual\/self framework and terminology. Thus, Shimazono\nSusumu and Yumiyama Tatsuya both identify a vitalist, spiritualist world-\nview that affirms individual, this-worldly salvation as a defining charac-\nteristic of Japanese NRMs.16\nThe focus on this-worldly salvation, which places the individual at the\nnexus of spiritual and physical forces, is grounded in an outlook in\nwhich the spiritual world (especially ancestral spirits) may influence\nthe physical world. Such intervention may be malevolent (unhappy\nspirits causing misfortunes such as illness) or benevolent (protective\nspirits helping the living attain success and happiness), but it invariably\nrevolves around notions of karma, morality, and techniques to eradicate\nthe malevolent or promote the benevolent. Karma, a notion derived\nfrom Buddhism but common in Japanese NRMs, includes individual\nresponsibility for life status and the importance of moral behavior\ntowards others and one\u2019s ancestors (who must be cared for after death\nto remain benevolent overseers of individual and familial fortunes).\nRepresentative in this respect is Agonsh\u00fb\u2019s insistence that misfortune\nresults from neglect of the spirits of the dead.17\nJapanese NRMs also provide a means of eradicating misfortune and\nensuring individual salvation by advocating spiritual techniques, e.g.,\nMahikari\u2019s okiyome (spiritual purification through the raising of hands),\nor Agonsh\u00fb\u2019s use of Buddhist-style rituals designed to placate and purify\nunhappy spirits, thereby eradicating spiritual pollutions or transforming\nspirits into protectors.18 This magical orientation goes hand-in-hand\nwith an emphasis on morality, founded in Buddhist and Confucian\nethics, as the basis of social thought in Japan. Rituals are underpinned\nby the recognition of one\u2019s moral duty to care for spirits of the dead and\nto behave in appropriate ways, because what one does to others can\nreturn to affect oneself and one\u2019s kin, a concept Hardacre identifies as\nthe notion that \u201cother people are mirrors.\u201d19 Techniques and morality\nin the form of correct behavior are parts of the same dynamic.20\nIndividual transformation, salvation, and liberation from negative\ninfluences comprise a common Japanese NRM vision of the world as\nneeding imminent spiritual transformation. Indeed, Japanese NRMs as\na whole have been characterized by millennial orientations ranging from\nyonaoshi (world renewal) affirmed by nineteenth-century NRMs such as\nOomoto, to spiritual action intended to move the present material-based\nworld into a new spiritual realm, to Aum Shinriky\u00f4\u2019s more aggressive mil-\nlennialism that ended in violence. Such visions have tended to become\nless militant over time. Oomoto and Tenriky\u00f4 are examples of move-\nments whose millennial pronouncements in their early days implied a\nradical transformation of the political, social, and material order, but\nwhich have moved away from such overt radicalism even while con-\ntinuing to affirm hope in this-worldly spiritual transformation. Because\nof Aum\u2019s activities, more recent movements have downplayed their\nNova Religio\n90\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 90\nmillennial visions, although others\u2014notably Kensh\u00f4kai, a Nichiren\nBuddhism-derived NRM that has grown rapidly in recent years\u2014con-\ntinue to articulate dramatic millennial visions central to NRMs in Japan.21\nIntegral to visions of individual and world transformation and the\ncentrality of charismatic founders is the recurrent theme of restoring\noriginal truths to the world. Japanese NRMs are \u201cnew\u201d in positing alter-\nnatives to the existing order, but they rarely claim that their messages are\nnew in terms of never before manifesting in this world. They claim to re-\npresent truths in new forms, for instance by affirming the return of a\nfounder deity who reveals truths to a charismatic founder in order to\nrestore original order in a world corrupted by human misdeeds. This\ntheme marks numerous Shinto-derived NRMs such as Tenriky\u00f4 and\nOomoto. Also, it is found in NRMs such as Agonsh\u00fb and Shinnyo-en that\nclaim Buddhist origins and assert that inspirational founders, through\ntheir readings of Buddhist texts (in Shinnyo-en, the Mahaparinirvana\nSutra, in Agonsh\u00fb the Agamas), have been able to unlock ancient mean-\nings lost to earlier generations. Japanese NRMs in effect fuse their\nnewness with claims to represent religious truths emanating from time\nimmemorial.\nCharacteristics, Newness and Lineages of Provenance\nI have given a generalized, all-too-brief outline of the main character-\nistics whose commonality enables one to view Japanese NRMs as a coher-\nent category. In these characteristics one can discern some resemblance\n(notably in structural terms) to those outlined by Eileen Barker. There\nare, however, some differences. For example, Barker\u2019s argument that\nNRM membership \u201cis unlikely to reflect the general population\u201d22 may not\nbe viable in Japan because of the large number of people who have joined\nNRMs and because, as various studies indicate, NRM members tend to\nvary little, if at all, from national norms and may well be (as Tani Fumio\nhas commented in his study of Mahikari) \u201caverage Japanese.\u201d23\nI depart from Barker in two major respects. One is that she empha-\nsizes characteristics based on sociological and structural factors, whereas\nin the case of Japanese NRMs I place more emphasis on shared con-\nceptual characteristics, such as providing an alternative or new vision of\nan individual\u2019s place in the world. Such characteristics are more crucial\nthan sociological factors such as atypical membership, which appears\nnot to hold true in Japan to the degree that Barker suggests it does in\nother cultural contexts. \nPerhaps more critically, I disagree with Barker\u2019s view that shared\ncharacteristics are as they are \u201cmerely because they are new.\u201d24 Rather\nthan being \u201cnew,\u201d many of the defining characteristics that mark\nJapanese NRMs relate to being alternative, e.g., their focus on laity and\nself-selected charismatic leadership in contrast to the priestly hierarchies\nReader: Japanese New Religious Movements\n91\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 91\nof the established religions. Their central unifying concepts relate to the\nproclamation of new truths and messages of vitalistic salvation. Japanese\nNRMs that emerged in the nineteenth century still proclaim their mis-\nsion to transmit new truths and continue to manifest common NRM\ncharacteristics such as the focus on individual salvation and world\nrenewal. Especially when one considers their conceptual unities, the link\nbetween common characteristics is not something presaged solely upon\nchronological newness. \nDespite this disagreement with Barker, I remain convinced that her\napproach of looking at commonalities remains a viable means of classi-\nfying NRMs. Like Barker, I take issue with Melton\u2019s argument that NRMs\ntend to have more in common with the traditions from which they\nemerge than with each other. In Japan, as Melton has observed, there\nhas been plentiful discussion about these traditions, and one can easily\ndiscern lineages of NRMs that point to their provenance: as with their\ngenerational variegations, Japanese NRMs manifest a host of deriva-\ntions, some associated primarily with Buddhism (e.g., S\u00f4ka Gakkai,\nAgonsh\u00fb), others classified as Shinto-lineage (e.g., Tenriky\u00f4), and still\nothers as folk-derived (e.g., Mahikari, also seen as having Shinto con-\nnections). \nHowever, one needs to be cautious about emphasizing lineages of\nprovenance over the conceptual unities and common characteristics\noutlined above. It is important, for example, to emphasize that the lin-\neage derivation of Japanese NRMs centers to a great degree on ritual for-\nmats and types of textual authority. Thus, Agonsh\u00fb is a Buddhist NRM\nbecause it uses Buddhist sutras and ritual practices, and has statues and\nBuddhist-style altars in its religious centers; Tenriky\u00f4 is a Shinto-lineage\nNRM primarily because of its ritual practices and modes of worship; and\nMahikari is folk-derived because of the folk origins of its healing prac-\ntices. To complicate matters further, one can make more nuanced line-\nage distinctions because of fissiparous tendencies in Japanese NRMs. For\nexample Tenriky\u00f4, Oomoto, and Sekai Ky\u00fbseiky\u00f4 have suffered seces-\nsions spawning further NRMs.\nHowever, this does not mean that a NRM with, for example, Buddhist\norientation such as Agonsh\u00fb necessarily has more in common with the\nBuddhist tradition than with NRMs whose ritual patterns derive from\nShinto or the folk tradition. Established Buddhist groups tend to\nemphasize differences between themselves and Agonsh\u00fb, and to draw\nattention to apparent disjunctions between traditional Buddhist teach-\nings and Agonsh\u00fb\u2019s somewhat inventive claims to manifest \u201coriginal\nBuddhism\u201d (genshi Bukky\u00f4) through interpretations of early Buddhist\ntexts in ways that infuse them with folk beliefs relating to the spirits of\nthe dead.25 Agonsh\u00fb may proclaim that beliefs surrounding such spir-\nits and the causes of misfortune are \u201coriginal Buddhism,\u201d but in reality\nthey share more common ground with Shinto- and folk-derived NRMs\nNova Religio\n92\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 92\n(e.g., Mahikari) than orthodox Buddhist teachings. Mahikari and\nAgonsh\u00fb have different derivations, but this is less significant than the\nsimilarities of their conceptual worldviews. Indeed, after having spent\ntime at centers of both religions and observed comparable practices\n(e.g., modes of counseling people claiming to suffer misfortunes), I\nfind it much easier to see them both as NRMs with common conceptual\ncharacteristics, than to see linkages between Agonsh\u00fb and established\nBuddhist sects. As noted earlier, there is a continuum in temporal terms\nbetween Japanese NRMs from Tenriky\u00f4 to recently emerging NRMs,\nand a continuum in their conceptual and defining characteristics as\nNRMs. It is more useful, when considering Japanese NRMs, to look at\ntheir similarities rather than focusing on their lineages.\nCONCLUSION\nI have suggested that one can develop definitional frameworks for\nNRMs in Japan centered around their \u201cnewness\u201d in terms of their his-\ntorical development in conjunction with the continuing processes of\nmodernity, and in terms of their public perception as \u201calternative\u201d and\n\u201coutsider\u201d movements, and through their contradistinction to estab-\nlished mainstream traditions. I have indicated that they share common\ncharacteristics in terms of structures and concepts that are helpful iden-\ntifying markers of their nature as NRMs. In such contexts, one can\nappropriately study and classify an \u201cold\u201d NRM such as Tenriky\u00f4 within\nthe same broad category as late twentieth-century Japanese NRMs.\nWhile being alternative is an indicator of being an NRM, being chrono-\nlogically new need not be. Movements can be fourth-generation and a\ncentury old yet \u201cnew\u201d in terms of history and characteristics. Indeed, by\nhaving a flexible notion of history that recognizes a wider concept of\nNRMs as a coherent set of movements emerging within a broad but\ncohesive historical framework spanning several generations, and by\nexamining, as Japanese scholars have, how different periods and fluc-\ntuating social conditions within that broader framework have affected\nexisting NRMs while giving rise to other waves and types, one can\ndevelop a more comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of the\npatterns and processes through which NRMs emerge, develop, and\nevolve over time. \nWhile I therefore argue that focusing on the chronologically new is\nhighly problematic, I emphasize that the Japanese case indicates that\none should not get trapped into making artificial and unworkable dif-\nferentiations between the new and the alternative. Equally, it would\nappear problematic to emphasize the alternative as the defining feature\nof NRMs without examining what might link such movements in other\nways, for example structurally or, as I have shown with Japanese NRMs,\nconceptually. Of course, I recognize that while the Japanese case\nReader: Japanese New Religious Movements\n93\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 93\nprovides a good example through which to develop broader studies, one\ncannot see it or indeed any particular regionally or culturally bound set\nof NRMs as the norm. The Japanese case reminds us that it is no bad\nthing for scholars to realize that what pertains to modern Western cul-\ntural settings may not always be replicated in other contexts. This is not\nonly a reminder that Western models are not universal(and hence can-\nnot be assumed to be the sole basis for the formation of disciplinary\nstructures of study(but it is also, in reverse, a reminder to those who get\nimmersed in studying other cultures (e.g., Japan) that what they assume\nto be normative may not translate as such in other contexts.\nThis point needs to be taken on board if a designated field of study\n(Bromley\u2019s NRS) is to develop in ways that do not merely replicate\nmethodological biases and cultural orientations that typified early\nWestern-centric development of Religious Studies. It is critical to nur-\nture awareness of ways in which NRMs in Japan, and Africa, Latin\nAmerica, other parts of Asia, and so on are conceived and defined, and\nto avoid assuming that what works in Western contexts can be applied\nequally elsewhere. It is also important, if Bromley\u2019s vision materializes,\nto take note from the Japanese case of the importance of historical\nvision and observing movements over relatively extended periods.\nAlthough Bromley speaks of studying NRMs as they \u201care in the process\nof developing,\u201d26 there is much to be learned from continuing to study\nNRMs even when they attain chronological maturity, and especially if,\nbecause they stand in contradistinction to the mainstream and share\ncommonalities with newer movements, they remain perceived as NRMs\nin their own cultural settings.\nENDNOTES\n1 J.

The problems of this typology become\nevident when, discussing Japan, Melton identifies Shin Buddhism as an exam-\nple of a church or established religious body, when in fact it is a school within a\nlarger tradition (Buddhism), which is subdivided into a number of sectarian\norganizations. In Japanese contexts, historians of religion have normally used\nsect as a translation of sh\u00fb, commonly used to identify branches within the wider\ntradition of Buddhism. In this context, Shin Buddhism (J\u00f4do Shinsh\u00fb) is a sect\nof Buddhism. My point is not to confuse issues but to stress the need for care\nwhen applying Western-derived concepts to other contexts where they might not\nwork as well.\nNova Religio\n94\nNR0902.qxd  9\/13\/05  12:05 PM  Page 94\n3 Japanese nouns remain unchanged and can be singular or plural, depending\non context.\n4 Japanese names are given in Japanese order (family name followed by given\nname). \n5 For a discussion of Japanese studies of NRMs see Trevor Astley, \u201cNew Reli-\ngions,\u201d in The Nanzan Guide to Japanese Religions, ed.

S\u00f4ka Gakkai is conspicuous by its\nabsence, as are many newer NRMs. Further information on the Shinsh\u00fbren, includ-\ning a list of participating NRMs, is available at <http:\/\/www.shinshuren.or.jp\/\nenglish\/>, accessed 29 May 2005.\n8 In his essay Melton commented on the role of established religions in the West\nin fomenting anti-NRM sentiments, noting the little academic attention paid to\nthis topic. The Japanese case would support his view; there is evidence that\nadherents and academics of mainstream traditions, notably Buddhism, were\nactive in fostering perceptions of NRMs as outsider or deviant groups, a point\nGeorge J.
