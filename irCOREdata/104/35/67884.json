Western music (including\nthe idea of the individual composer). And, unbel-\nievable as it may seem, this book is the first\nauthoritative study in English on the history of\nWestern-influenced Japanese music in the 20th cen-\ntury.1 The book opens with a well-chosen epigraph\nfrom Zenrin Kushu: \u2018The wild geese do not intend\nto cast their reflection. The water has no mind to\nreceive their image\u2019. A short and enthusiastic fore-\nword by Luciano Berio helps to draw attention to\nthe demanding undertaking. The book is divided\ninto two main parts: Japanese music before and\nafter the Second World War. In general the first part\nis more valuable, as until now there has been a pro-\nfound lack of accumulated knowledge on the\nsubject. Luciana Galliano provides a clear-cut his-\ntorical, sociological, and metaphysical panorama in\nwhich she embeds the musical facts. \nThe introduction, about traditional Japanese\ncultural values and Japan\u2019s transition into the 20th\ncentury, is the most important section and should\nbe read with close attention by anyone interested\nin music globally. This introduction is divided in\nthree parts: a consideration of the theory and aes-\nthetics of traditional Japanese music; the concept\nof time in Japanese music; and the stratification\nand conservation of traditional forms of music. In\nthese chapters Galliano proves her ability to give a\nconvincing and comprehensible insight into this\nvast cultural area without either simplifying nor\n\u2018Westernizing\u2019 her topic. She has really under-\nstood that Japanese philosophy cannot simply be\nput into Western terminology and has found a\nway to convey its atmosphere, its aroma, in a kind\nof stream of consciousness. As a result some pas-\nsages may have to be read several times to\ntranscend what might seem to be the triviality of\ntheir surface meaning. \nNext, Galliano describes the introduction of\nWestern music to Japan, which met a completely\nunprepared mentality. As is described in the next\nmain chapters \u2013 \u2018The evolution of a Western-style\nmusical language in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury\u2019, and \u2018A new musical world\u2019, the outer ele-\nments of the new language were absorbed with\nconsiderable speed \u2013 but of course it took some\ntime until some composers of noteworthy origi-\nnality emerged. Galliano provides us with clear,\nnon-ideological ideas about the opposing schools\nof German and French origin, the first generation\nof the \u2018avant-garde\u2019 and the Shinko association of\ninnovative composers. Almost every fairly signifi-\ncant composer is subject of a sympathetic\ndescription that doesn\u2019t simply follow the conven-\ntional lines. And we are offered an overview on\nmusic schools and pioneering symphony orches-\ntras, on music journals, the \u2018birth of opera\u2019, and,\nlast not least, \u2018Japanese society and the influence of\nbroadcasting and recording\u2019 \u2013 all these subjects are\ntreated critically but without arrogance. Then,\nwith \u2018Nationalism and music\u2019, we come to the years\nthat led into the war. A chapter researching \u2018politi-\ncal movements and the proletarian music league\u2019 is\nfollowed by one on propaganda and censorship.\nIn the beginning of the second part of her book\nGalliano analyses the \u2018cultural and social situation\nin the postwar period\u2019, comparing it with the\nEuropean reality and pointing out the elements of\ncontinuity and change. The general explanations\nof every chapter are followed by biographical and\nstylistic observations on certain selected com-\nposers. In extensive chapters, the adventures of\nthe postwar avant-garde are vividly portrayed (the\nlegendary Jikkenkobo group around Takemitsu\nand Yuasa, the development of electronic music,\nthe rise of the new-music life, a detailed history of\nthe composers\u2019 associations), as are the 1960s with\ntheir diametrically opposing directions \u2013 on the\none side the Cageian impact on \u2018happening\u2019 and\nperformance, on the other the rebirth of tradi-\ntional Japanese music, and finally the \u2018closing\ndecades of the twentieth century\u2019. This latter\nchapter is subdivided into \u2018the leading composers\u2019\n(Yoritsune Matsudaira, Joji Yuasa, Toru\nTakemitsu, Maki Ishii, and Toshio Ichiyanagi), fol-\nlowed by a short overview of the most recent\nsituation, a look at the hogaku composers (those\nwho have studied and are working with tradition-\nal Japanese instruments, for example Minoru Miki\nor Ryohei Hirose), and at so-called \u2018other com-\nposers\u2019 (here I would have definitely preferred\nmore information about Teizo Matsumura who\nis, as Luciana Galliano states, \u2018much appreciated1 It was originally written in Italian and issued in 1998. \n\uf762\uf76f\uf76f\uf76b \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773\n41Tempo 58 (228) 41\u201350 \u00a9 2004 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0040298204000130 Printed in the United Kingdom\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nas a composer in Japan\u2019) and the \u2018next generation\u2019.\nThe composer vignettes are illustrated with plen-\ntiful music examples. \nAll in all, no-one who lacks access to Japanese\nsources (almost all of them, of course, in the\nJapanese language) yet wishes to explore the field\nof Japanese music of the yogaku kind (music writ-\nten by composers) should ignore this publication.\nIt is simply indispensable. Some of the descrip-\ntions and evaluations in the avant-garde field may\nseem more conventional than the whole first part\nof the book, but this doesn\u2019t diminish the worth of\nGalliano\u2019s approach, which will be the measure\nfor future releases in this field. The only thing I\nreally miss probably goes beyond the intended\ntopic, but would be worth serious consideration\nin the context. It might be entitled \u2018Western com-\nposers influenced by Japanese music\u2019. Just to\nmention a prominent example: the Finn Pehr\nHenrik Nordgren (b. 1944) who studied in Japan\nwith Yoshio Hasegawa, became deeply influenced\nby Japanese culture, and composed two quartets\nfor traditional Japanese instruments and the fasci-\nnating Autumnal Concerto for traditional Japanese\ninstruments and Western orchestra: this is, for live\nperformance, a perfect pairing for Takemitsu\u2019s\nNovember Steps. Nordgren is still very closely\ninvolved with Japanese spirit. His Sixth\nSymphony, set to words from David Suzuki\u2019s\nDeclaration of Interdependence, has been premi\u00e8red\nwith overwhelming success in Japan.\nChristoph Schl\u00fcren\nSing, Ariel: Essays and Thoughts for Alexander Goehr\u2019s\nSeventieth Birthday, edited by Alison Latham. Ashgate,\n\u00a347.50.\nSome measure of the scope and achievement of\nSing, Ariel can be gained through comparison to\n1980\u2019s symposium The Music of Alexander Goehr.2\nThe earlier collection \u2013 \u2018notes towards a musical\nportrait\u2019, as Bayan Northcott suggested in his pref-\nace \u2013 provided a much-needed overview of\nGoehr\u2019s music through to the end of the 1970s.\nThe focus on the music entailed a neglect of the\nman, at least in the opinion of Robin Holloway,\nwhose critique of his former teacher concluded\nthat \u2018If Goehr the generous teacher, the eloquent\nexpounder, the sympathetic colleague, the amus-\ning and lovable man, makes no appearance here, it\nis because \u2013 in my view \u2013 his music has pursued a\nsomewhat \u201cdefensive objectivity\u201d \u2019.\nTwenty-three years later, Julian Anderson \u2013\nSing, Ariel\u2019s Consultant Commissioning Editor \u2013\noffers us a different picture: one that is \u2018perhaps\nthe best portrait of Goehr in that its articles and\ntheir authors encompass a wide variety of music\nalong with other disciplines\u2019 (p. xx). Rubbing\nshoulders with these scholarly essays, the judi-\ncious selection of personal reminiscences and\ntributes from friends and family alike bear elo-\nquent testimony to the man that Holloway felt\nwas missing from the previous collection. Yet\ntimes \u2013 and the reception of Goehr\u2019s music \u2013 have\nchanged, and the \u2018monolithic and Germanic\u2019\nimage of Goehr in 1980 that Holloway identifies\nin his contribution to Sing, Ariel (p. 1) is no longer\nas widespread as it once was. Holloway provides a\nwelcome overview of the themes and threads that\nconnect Goehr\u2019s increasingly diverse and varied\nmusic. Furthermore, he can now detect (or admit\nto) Goehr\u2019s personal qualities in his music, con-\ncluding that \u2018Chez Sandy, style and man clearly are\ninterpenetrated, each mirroring the other in self-\nrenewal and self-transformation\u2019 (p. 6). Positioned\nas it is, at the end of the first essay proper, this con-\nclusion takes on the quality of a statement of\nintent; and indeed, many of the contributions that\nfollow can be read as illuminations of either style,\nman, or both. Acting as a counterbalance at the\nopposite end of the book, and a neat inversion of\nHolloway\u2019s catalogue raisonn\u00e9, we have Goehr\u2019s\nother Cambridge composition colleague, Hugh\nWood, who delivers a touching narrative of his\nfriendship with Goehr against the background of\nthe music.\nThe essays and messages that separate\nHolloway and Wood\u2019s contributions also resist\neasy classification. The seven shortest contribu-\ntions \u2013 birthday greetings from Simon Rattle,\nElliott Carter, Oliver Knussen, Daniel Barenboim,\nSteve Martland, Sue Knussen and Milton Babbitt \u2013\nprovide snapshots of the influence of Goehr\u2019s\nmusic, teaching and personality. Although they do\nnot appear to form part of the main thrust of the\nbook (the messages are not listed in the contents\npage, nor are the contributors mentioned in the\nshort biographies), they encapsulate in brief the\nsentiments that can be detected on nearly every\npage. These messages \u2013 and many more passages\nthat occur in Sing, Ariel, such as fascinating snip-\npets within Lydia Goehr\u2019s tribute \u2013 go some way\nto making good the lack of a more complete \nbiography of the composer.\nNevertheless, most readers will be itching to\nread more about the music. As an insight into\nGoehr\u2019s artistic concerns, influence and beliefs,\nand as an overview of Goehr\u2019s music post-1980,\nmuch of Sing, Ariel is indispensable.

The multi-\nfarious range of analytical approaches brought to\nbear on Goehr\u2019s music demonstrate the fecundity\nof his work. Goehr\u2019s serial-modal manner of com-\nposition is well-documented now, and no longer\ncommands centre-stage in analysis of his early\nmusic. Thus Bayan Northcott gives as much room\nto the way in which concepts such theme and vari-\nations and synthesis operate in respect to the Little\nMusic for Strings op. 16, and Anthony Gilbert\nexplores (rhythmic) proportion in the Suite op. 11.\nThis latter analysis in particular opens up fertile\nnew avenues in understanding Goehr\u2019s music in\nperceived time.\nOf the more recent music, Sylvina Milstein and\nAaron Einbond respectively use source material to\ngain insight into the relationship between dode-\ncaphony and Goehr\u2019s use of figured bass in\nSchlussgesang and The Death of Moses. The former\nis the more detailed, if less reader-friendly, and the\nlatter in particular suffers from an inability to\nexplain adequately the way in which Goehr\u2019s fore-\nground is a particular elaboration of the\nmiddleground\/background. (This is an analytical\nproblem that Northcott, too, has identified in\nregards to Goehr\u2019s serial matrices and the result-\ning compositions: p. 168.) Einbond also makes\nmention of the text in the movements he analyses\n(the fifth and sixth): I see no reason why the full\ntext should not be given for these movements\nsince it is for, say, Jonathan Dunsby\u2019s essay on The\nLaw of the Quadrille. (The complete text for Sing,\nAriel was more relevant, given that two articles\nrelated to it.) \nGoehr\u2019s relationship to his heritage \u2013 both\nmusical and intellectual \u2013 unsurprisingly forms\nanother theme within Sing, Ariel, although one\nthat is often approached indirectly. Christopher\nWintle\u2019s account of Goehr\u2019s analysis of\nSchoenberg\u2019s Fourth String Quartet sheds light\nnot just on the subtleties of Goehr\u2019s musical imag-\nination, but the way in which it relates to his past.\n(It would, incidentally, be intriguing to see how\nthe concept of the \u2018island formation\u2019 in\nSchoenbergian thought \u2013 as related by Goehr \u2013\napplied to the latter\u2019s own music; yet another\navenue of inquiry suggested by Sing, Ariel.) Other\nwriters seem to approach this topic by analogy;\nnarratives, fantasies and tales about Busoni, Bach\nand Confucius all provide fresh perspectives, if no\nconcrete detail, about Goehr\u2019s engagement with\nthe past.\nThe contributions of former pupils paint an\nintriguing picture. Julian Anderson recounts the\nfar-reaching implications of a couple of com-\nments by Goehr on his own compositional\napproach; similarly, George Benjamin details the\nslow process through which Goehr\u2019s didactic use\nof canon came to artistic fruition in his\n[Benjamin\u2019s] own music. Reading these accounts,\none wishes more than ever that Goehr\u2019s often-\nmentioned idea about a composition manual \u2013\nwhether an update of Stanford\u2019s Musical\nComposition or not \u2013 had been realized. Whether\nsuch a manual could communicate the same set of\nvalues that Goehr imparts to his pupils \u2013 Poole\u2019s\nessay reveals the social commitment in the music\nof both teacher and pupil \u2013 is another matter.\nPoole\u2019s comments seem to embody the notion\nthat Goehr teaches \u2018thinking method\u2019, rather than\n\u2018technique method\u2019 (p. 39); such an emphasis\nexplains both Goehr\u2019s own \u2018anti-style\u2019 stance and\nthe characteristic diversity of his pupils.\nThe relationship between composer and society\n(such as that which Poole outlines), or more gen-\nerally, the meaning of music, forms a central\ncomponent in Goehr\u2019s writings,3 and this topic\nalso emerges in Sing, Ariel. The question of what\nmusic means \u2013 or can be made to mean \u2013 is central\nto two essays: Simha Aron and Jean Khalfa occupy\na position not unlike the \u2018defensive objectivity\u2019\nRobin Holloway finds in Goehr\u2019s music, whilst\nNicholas Cook explores the perfomative aspects\nof notation. Cook invokes the Chinese qin reper-\ntory as an \u2018other\u2019 to which Western practice can be\ncompared and contrasted. The references are typi-\ncally wide-ranging and related to Goehr\u2019s own\nconcerns, including ethnomusicology, Corellian\nelaboration of ideas, figured bass, transcription\nand modelling, and Schoenbergian notion of\nideas. Given this scope, and given that Cook\u2019s the-\nsis will be familiar to many who know his work, it\nis frustrating that he doesn\u2019t relate it explicitly to\nGoehr\u2019s own music \u2013 one suspects that the result-\ning insights would have been fascinating.\nThis grumble is one that can be raised at the\nbook on a number of occasions: one cannot help\nbut wish that a number of contributors had delved\ninto the music in greater depth. Depth is also lack-\ning in the cursory bibliography, perhaps the most\ndisappointing aspect of the book. Its brevity can\nbe contrasted unfavourably with the welcome\ninclusion of a complete work-list and discography.\nAt the very least it would have been helpful to have\na complete list of Goehr\u2019s writings, building on\nNeil Boynton\u2019s useful checklist published in 1992\n3 See, for example, Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander\nGoehr, ed. Puffett, Derrick (London: Faber, 1998).\n\uf762\uf76f\uf76f\uf76b \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 43\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nin Music Analysis.4 At its best, however, Sing, Ariel is\ninformative, stimulating and provoking, setting\nan agenda for future thinking, responses and\nresearch that will serve for years to come. The\nbook is lovingly compiled, including ten illustra-\ntions and 56 high-quality musical examples.\nAlison Latham should be singled out for her\nimpeccable editorial standards; the presentation\non the whole is excellent. As an introduction to\nAlexander Goehr\u2019s music, ideas and interests,\nSing, Ariel is to be recommended.\nEdward Venn\nThe Cambridge Companion to Stravinsky edited by\nJonathan Cross. Cambridge University Press, \u00a347.50\/\n$70.00 (hardback), \u00a317.95\/$26.00 (paperback).\nThis new \u2018Cambridge Companion\u2019 to Stravinsky\nis a dispiriting affair. Most of its 14 chapters are\nflaccid \u2013 amazingly inappropriate adjective for the\ntingly music and its witty, self-conscious, ever con-\ntemporary composer, here dulled down into tidy\npigeon-holes without a cat to disturb them. \u2018Who\nwants it, who needs it?\u2019 was Stravinsky\u2019s \nhalf-humorous, half-despairing wail at the prolif-\neration of new music. But composition however\npuny is at least trying to attain some kind of\nunique and irreplaceable statement which, if it\ndoes manage to, willy-nilly becomes necessary (if\nnot necessarily desirable). No hint can be detected\nhere of any such urgency.\nIt was clear after Stravinsky and the Russian\nTraditions appeared in 1996 that subsequent work\non the composer would have to be regarded as\n\u2018post-Taruskin\u2019. Since those monumental two vol-\numes the first of Stephen Walsh\u2019s biography has\narrived (1999), ably steering its own independent\ncourse. Most of the Companion\u2019s contributors are\nbeholden to these recent ancestors, not always\nadvantageously. Rather than the springboard for\nfurther explorations and refinements, they show\nthem to hang heavy, a new orthodoxy, at first\nimpressive, by now oppressive, setting fast into\nrigidity that requires to be broken up and suppled.\nThe historical chapters suffer worst. The trawl\nthrough the composer\u2019s oeuvre from student\nmediocrity in the earliest years of last century to\nserial old-mastery in its 50s and 60s is so familiar\nthat exceptional flair is needed merely to tread it\nover again as currently received: let alone to\ntweak, subvert, place at unexpected angles, cast in\nnew lights (and their concomitant shadows) that\nadd something of value to what already exists. A\ndisagreeable side-effect of T\u2019s and W\u2019s clarifica-\ntions of the factual record is a mean knowingness\nabout Stravinsky\u2019s mendacities and re-writings of\nhistory. As often before, Wagner biography and\ncommentary come to mind. Chez Stravinsky too,\nit\u2019s just too easy! Taruskin and Walsh are generous\nhere (notwithstanding a certain vengeful glee in\nunleashing the hounds of truth): tout comprendre\nc\u2019est tout pardonner. But Christopher Butler\u2019s\nschoolmarm severity (\u2018Stravinsky as Modernist\u2019)\nis unjustified by corresponding illumination, and\nhe can get tone (if not fact) quite wrong \u2013 see his\nremarks on the two rag-inspired piano pieces,\np.27, or, p.25, the infelicity of calling the danse\nsacrale \u2018yet another erotically engaging sacrifice of\nthe female to succeed those in Salome, Elektra, and\nSchmitt\u2019s Trag\u00e9die de Salom\u00e9\u2019. Though one has to\nsuppress one\u2019s yawns at the editor\u2019s chapter on\n\u2018Stravinsky\u2019s theatres\u2019, he doesn\u2019t get it wrong.\nMartha M. Hyde on Stravinsky\u2019s neo-classicism\nalso has its moments, here undermined by sopho-\nmoric jejeuneness, e.g. on the Symphony in C or the\n\u2018potential defect\u2019 \u2013 a \u2018lack of irony\u2019 (Oh Gawd!) \u2013\nin The Fairy\u2019s Kiss: and she ends up out of her\ndepth in heavy weather over the Rake libretto,\nclutching desperately at \u2018Time\u2019 and Faust, decep-\ntive lifelines both. No further light on her given\ntopic, that trim little hold-all \u2018neo-classicism\u2019 upon\nwhich the years between the wars are posited,\nwith Stravinsky in particular, and most other con-\ntemporary practitioners too; nor its pre-history,\nnor its post-war continuities and dispersals. Joseph\nN. Straus on \u2018Stravinsky the serialist\u2019 doesn\u2019t ven-\nture out of his depth, and his modest chart of the\nshallows has its uses. The other chapters in the\nbook\u2019s first half \u2013 with the partial exception of\nArnold Whittall\u2019s brave, sophisticated attempt to\nmediate the much-bloodied polarity of Stravinsky\nwith Schoenberg \u2013 are too grey to be distinguished.\nThe second half, six more chapters, contains\nthe mitigating portions of this curate\u2019s egg (if one\ncan forget \u2013 I managed it easily \u2013 the pedestrian\ntrundle through \u2018Stravinsky and the critics\u2019).\nNicholas Cook scrupulously records the discrep-\nancies and mind-changes making up \u2018Stravinsky\u2019 \u2013\nthe composer as recorded down the decades\nunder his own direction.

He grows so angry about the\ninclusion within the setting of \u2018Tomorrow shall be\nmy dancing day\u2019 (in the 1951 Cantata) of the triplet\nconcerning the Jews\u2019 betrayal of Christ, that he\ncannot see the crown for the thorns. It simply\nwon\u2019t do to use Stravinsky\u2019s non-omission of this\ntraditional trope as the key to unlock unaccept-\nable attitudes of a man who despite his\nexceptional powers of mind over many areas\nother than music was also the inevitable child of\nhis time, class, country, upbringing, with all their\nresidue of convention in language, manners,\nmind-set. It doesn\u2019t make a sound argument, let\nalone a convincing conclusion. Yet its presence\nhere disturbs the all-too-academic context to its\nadvantage (by which I mean disadvantage): it\u2019s the\nonly item, albeit tendentious and in every way par-\ntial, to open up the wider air that Stravinsky cries\nout for and can certainly take.\nRobin Holloway\nRoger Sessions: How a \u201cDifficult\u201d Composer Got That Way\nby Frederick Prausnitz. Oxford University Press, \u00a330.00.\nRoger Sessions (1896\u20131985) was ever the compos-\ner widely admired but whose music was\ninfrequently heard. He gained his solid reputation\nthrough his colleagues\u2019 reactions to his creative\nwork, as well as through his teaching and essays.\nLarger public awareness of his music was minimal.\nHis first major composition, The Black Maskers\n(completed 1923), he later wryly referred to as his\nFirebird. His four other major works before World\nWar II include a violin concerto (1935) completed\nwithin a few months of violin concertos by\nProkofiev and Berg. To this writer, the Sessions is\nas fine as the other two. Were it not for the tor-\ntured history of its lack of performances, Sessions\nmight be much better known.\nHis accomplishments accelerated from the mid-\n1940s. In the 40 years he lived after World War II, he\nwrote eight of nine symphonies, other orchestral\nworks, two of three pianos sonatas, two of three\ninstrumental concertos, his two operas, and almost\nall his solo, chamber, and vocal\/choral works.\nSince his death, his music has found no surge of\ninterest. Although significant recordings are avail-\nable, some of his big works are not recorded, and\nonly a few are available on more than one CD \u2013\ndespite useful articles, theses, and books about\nhim, plus many still-active former students.\nSome substantial early works bear traces of\nStravinskian neo-classicism. Then Sessions gradu-\nally moved into atonality and, ultimately, serialism\nas free as Berg\u2019s but going in different directions.\nWith his constant search for ideal musical expres-\nsion in a deeply human context, his outlook,\naesthetic, and actual compositions are closer to\nSchoenberg\u2019s. In a strong sense, he is Schoenberg\u2019s\nAmerican spiritual successor.\nFrederick Prausnitz conducted Sessions\u2019s\nmusic on both sides of the Atlantic for several\ndecades. That includes his largest work, the opera\nMontezuma, in New York in 1982. Sessions\u2019 Ninth\nand last Symphony (1978) is dedicated to him.\nPrausnitz\u2019s main sources besides Sessions him-\nself are his family, his students and colleagues in\nmusic and other fields, and many letters he wrote.\nThe wealth of detail he produces makes this book\na fruitful resource for anyone remotely interested\nin Roger Sessions. Noteworthy are his treatments\nof Sessions\u2019s early years and his environments\nthroughout his life, whether in the USA or in\nEurope, e.g. Italy and Germany, which influenced\nhim greatly between the world wars. Prausnitz\nmakes those environments part of the composer\u2019s\nlife, not just background filler.\nHe also gives attention to two composers\nSessions felt close to personally, although not styl-\nistically: Bloch as a teacher and Dallapiccola as a\nfriend. He is most illuminating about the charac-\nter of Sessions himself, letting it emerge, often\nthrough the composer\u2019s own words, without forc-\ning points. He leaves intricate paradoxes to do\ntheir work, the principal one being Sessions\u2019s need\nto engage (with family, musicians, and listeners)\nbeing matched by his need to develop intense\nartistic independence.\nThe biography is gently interrupted by three\nchapters titled \u2018The Musical Idea\u2019. In those,\nPrausnitz deals with some musical concepts\nSessions is known for, both in his music and in his\nteaching and essays. He states that no technical\nknowledge of music theory is needed for them,\nwhich isn\u2019t really so. That is most obvious when he\ndiscusses, not quite successfully, Heinrich\nSchenker and Sessions\u2019s reaction to him. Still, the\nthree chapters do emphasize the musical idea or\nimpulse as a general concept.\nThere is remarkable insight in this book. One\nexample comes at the point (1936) when Sessions\nand his first wife (Barbara Foster) divorced, after\nwhich he soon remarried (Lisl Franck). Prausnitz\nis convincing that the divorce was as much from\nSessions\u2019s mother as from his wife. In addition, the\nfew ventures Prausnitz makes into art and archi-\ntecture are attractively integrated into the\nnarrative.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f46\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe book maintains a good balance in this\nsense: Prausnitz himself does not intrude. But\nwhen we need to hear from him as someone con-\nnected to the composer, we do. His research is\nimpressive; he also lets it largely speak for itself.\nFor all these reasons, the book is useful \u2013 poten-\ntially. There are problems in its realization. One:\nthere is no list of works or recordings. Another:\nSessions\u2019s later years are treated too briefly. The\nconverse is that too much weight is placed else-\nwhere. Sessions\u2019s years in Germany, for example,\nare over-described, mostly because of repetition.\nEven an illustration may be too long, e.g. a letter\nfrom the composer to his mother that takes up five\npages of small type without commensurate\nimportance or commentary.\nCertain ideas are also repeated too often. That\nseems a problem of integration, whose lack is felt\nin a different way in treatments of, for example,\nDallapiccola, Krenek, Borgese (librettist of\nMontezuma), and Sessions\u2019s piano playing. Put\nanother way: there are many loose ends and gaps.\nEditing might have caught those \u2013 also some lit-\neral repetitions, whether short (\u2018the New York\nPhilharmonic Symphony Society of New York\u2019)\nor long (nine lines of quotation on page 264 reap-\npear complete on page 265). Some awkward\nrepetitions are referenced in endnotes, which\nmakes them more obvious. Other mistakes don\u2019t\nabound but are noticeable. Xenakis gets two dif-\nferent spellings of his first name (neither is\nstandard), two different birth years, and no death\nyear. Even if not a mistake, series such as sym-\nphonies should not be indexed alphabetically by\nordinal number. (Eighth Symphony precedes\nThird Symphony, with many works between.)\nThe book could clearly be shorter, to much\nadvantage. Still, its weaknesses do not nullify its\nstrengths. Those strengths also complement\nrather than diminish the singular achievement of\nAndrea Olmstead in her three books on Roger\nSessions, published between 1985 and 1992.\nNow if only all this writing led to more per-\nformances and recordings \u2026\nPaul Rapoport\nBlack Mountain College: Experiment in Art edited by\nVincent Katz. The MIT Press, $75.00.\nOn 25 September 1933, John Andrew Rice, who\nhad been recently dismissed from his position at\nRollins College in Florida, joined with colleagues\nto open a new college 15 miles from Asheville,\nNorth Carolina, in buildings belonging to the\nAsheville YMCA. The rented campus was the site\nof the YMCA\u2019s summer camp, unused during the\nrest of the year; later, in 1941, the college moved to\nproperty bought by the school at nearby Lake\nEden. Organized around Rice\u2019s goal of teaching\nphilosophy as Socrates might have done, the \u2018pro-\ngressive\u2019 school which they founded was owned\nand run by its faculty, with no governing board,\nand with a large degree of input from its students.\nThere were no credits and no grades. When a stu-\ndent felt ready to graduate, he would request an\nexamination which was conducted by an external\nexaminer.\nThe Black Mountain College existed from 1933\nuntil 1956. It never had more than fifty students at\nany one time, and it rarely had the funds to offer its\nfaculty more than room and board. It was\nnonetheless a major influence on the visual arts,\nmusic, and poetry in the United States. The two\nmajor personalities of the school were first the\npainter Josef Alpers, recently arrived from the just\nclosed Bauhaus, who along with his wife Anni was\non the faculty from 1933 until 1949, and later the\npoet Charles Olson, who arrived at Black\nMountain in 1948 and stayed until the school\nclosed in 1956. Most of the important American\nvisual artists of the 1940s and 50s were at one time\nor another associated with the school; these\nincluded Richard Lippold, Kenneth Noland, Ben\nShahn, Lyonel Feininger, Robert Motherwell,\nWillem and Elaine de Kooning, Franz Kline, and\nRobert Rauschenberg. With Olson\u2019s ascendancy,\nthe founding of The Black Mountain Review, which\nran to seven issues from 1953 to 1957, and the asso-\nciation of a number of writers including Robert\nCreeley, Hilda Morley, and John Weiners, the\nschool became a centre of alternative modernist\nAmerican poetry.\nThe musical scope of the school was smaller,\nbut hardly less important. In 1944 faculty member\nHeinrich Jalowetz, who had been one of\nSchoenberg\u2019s earliest pupils in Vienna, organized\na summer session which celebrated Schoenberg\u2019s\nseventieth birthday; the participants included\nEdward Steuermann, Ernst Krenek, Marcel Dick,\nRudolf Kolisch, and Roger Sessions. John Cage,\nwho came to the school in the spring of 1948 and\npremi\u00e8red his Sonatas and Interludes for prepared\npiano, was the moving force behind two summer\nsessions. The session in 1948 was dedicated to the\nworks of Satie. During the session Cage presented\nhis talk, \u2018Defense of Satie\u2019, which was not only a\ndefence of Satie and Webern, but more impor-\ntantly an attack on Beethoven and Western\nmusical aesthetics. It also featured a performance\nof Satie\u2019s play, La Pi\u00e8ge de Meduse, staged and\ndirected by Arthur Penn (his first directing experi-\nence), with Buckminster Fuller, Elaine de\n\uf762\uf76f\uf76f\uf76b \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 47\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nKooning, and Merce Cunningham in the cast, and\nwith sets by Willem de Kooning. The whole ses-\nsion was the culminating statement of Cage\u2019s\nphilosophy up to that point.\nCage returned in 1952, when he wrote 4\u201933\u201d,\nthe celebrated and notorious \u2018silent work\u2019, and\nTheater Piece No. 1, generally recognized at the first\n\u2018happening\u2019. These works marked Cage\u2019s move\ninto indeterminancy. David Tudor, who was intro-\nduced to Black Mountain by Cage, presented\nrecitals featuring works of Schoenberg, Webern,\nWolpe, Feldman, Wolff, and Boulez. Tudor and\nCage were jointly responsible for Stefan Wolpe\u2019s\njoining the faculty in 1953. Wolpe remained at the\nschool until its closing. Among the works he\nwrote at Black Mountain were his Enactments for\nthree pianos. Lou Harrison was also on the faculty\nfrom 1951 to 1953. The 1953 summer session\nmarked the founding of the Merce Cunningham\nDance Company.\nThe MIT Press, in association with an exhibi-\ntion about Black Mountain College at the Museo\nNacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid,\nhas published this book, edited by Vincent Katz. It\nfeatures four essays commissioned for the publica-\ntion: Katz discusses the history and philosophy of\nthe college, Martin Brody writes on the college\u2019s\ninfluence on American Music, Kevin Power writes\nabout The Black Mountain Review, and Robert\nCreeley offers thoughts on Olson and Black\nMountain College. The book is magnificently\nwell produced, lavishly illustrated with documen-\ntary photographs of people and events at the\nschool, and full of beautiful reproductions of a\nmultitude of paintings and drawings by the visual\nartists who taught and studied at Black Mountain\nCollege. These include not only those very well\nknown, but much more obscure and wonderful\nartists including Robert De Niro, Emerson\nWoelffer, Xanti Schawinsky, Esteban Vicente,\nJoseph Fiore, and Pat Passlof. This book hand-\nsomely documents the history of Black Mountain\nCollege and the accomplishment of the artists\nwho worked there as faculty and as students. It\nalso does an excellent job of conveying the seri-\nousness and the never-never-land intoxicating\ngrandeur of the place and the affection and devo-\ntion which it inspired in practically everyone who\nwas associated with it.\nRodney Lister\nFragmente zur musikalischen Postmoderne by Mirjana\nVeselinovic\u00b4-Hofman, translated from the Serbian by\nVlastimir Peric\u02c7ic\u00b4. Vol. 2 in the series Methodology of\nMusic Research, ed. Nico Sch\u00fcler. Peter Lang, 2003. \nMirjana Veselinovic\u00b4-Hofman is the incumbent of\nthe Chair of Musicology and Ethnomusicology at\nthe University of Belgrade, and the editor of the\n(English-language) musicological journal New\nSound. Although she has been active on the inter-\nnational congress scene for several years and has\npublished articles in both English and French, this\nis her first book to appear in a language other than\nher native Serbian (the original version having\nbeen published in Yugoslavia in 1997). As the title\nsuggests, the author does not aim at any \u2018univer-\nsal\u2019 summing-up of the phenomenon that is\nPost-Modernism. Rather is it an attempt to define\nits theoretical and practical co-ordinates. She\nbegins with one of the best overviews of the Post-\nModernist debate that the present writer has\nencountered, at once wide-ranging and concise.\nOne could be forgiven for thinking that there are\nas many definitions of \u2018Post-Modernism\u2019 as there\nare Post-Modernists. Some maintain that it is sim-\nply that which comes, chronologically, after\nModernism; some see it as, in essence, a continua-\ntion of Modernism, others as a negation thereof\n(as an \u2018anti-Modernism\u2019). Veselinovic\u00b4 sensibly pro-\nceeds to investigate how Post-Modernism differs\nboth from the various \u2018Neo-\u2019 styles of the 20th\ncentury (Neoclassicism in particular), and from\nthe Romantics\u2019 use of stylistic and formal musical\nelements from previous epochs. While in the\nRomantic era those elements (such as fugue)\nremained obviously \u2018historical\u2019 in expression, but\nchanged their stylistic context to that of\nRomanticism itself (p. 31), most Neo-Classicists\naimed at a restorative gesture of those elements\u2019\noriginal stylistic characteristics (p. 32). Post-\nModernism, however, differs again in not being\nengaged in \u2018restoration\u2019, rather regarding what\nhas gone before as a \u2018treasure trove\u2019 of material to\nbe used as the individual composer sees fit, with\ntoday\u2019s stylistic plurality (and a tendency to quota-\ntion) the logical result thereof (pp. 72\u20133, 79\u201383).\nVeselinovic\u00b4 does greater justice to the complexity\nof the historical process than this brief outline\nsuggests, her impressively broad array of sources\nbeing used to convincing effect. \nWhile Vlastimir Peric\u02c7ic\u00b4 \u2019s German too often\nreads like the translation it is, and while there are a\nnumber of minor typographical errors that the\npublisher\u2019s copy editors should have eliminated,\nthis book is nevertheless particularly to be wel-\ncomed, not least on account of its specific\ngeographical and aesthetic perspective. While\nVeselinovic\u00b4 is obviously au fait with the usual sus-\npects of Post-Modern aesthetics, both musical and\notherwise (Dahlhaus, Danuser, Habermas,\nLyotard and cohorts), she also refers pertinently to\na host of Eastern European writers and com-\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f48\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nposers, thus confirming that debates of\nModernity, Post- and otherwise, are not confined\nto Western European and American lecture halls.\n(Ex-)Yugoslavia has not had a good press in the\npast decade; but Veselinovic\u00b4\u2019s book can serve to\nremind us (as it has the present writer) that the sti-\nfling rule of Milosevic and his cronies did not\nmanage to annul artistic endeavour or silence\nfruitful intellectual debate. Serbia\u2019s problems\nstem not least from the fact that it is in numerous\nways a \u2018fringe\u2019 country, situated on the border\nbetween Islam and Christianity, between Roman\nCatholicism and Orthodoxy, the Germanic and\nthe Slavic, the Cyrillic and the Latin, and between\nWestern democracy and the former Soviet bloc.\nBut its geographical position has also served to\ngenerate a rich cultural heritage of which most of\nus, to our shame, still know relatively little.\nVeselinovic\u00b4\u2019s many references to books and arti-\ncles by her fellow Serbs make the present writer\ninquisitive to know more of their work; and her\ndiscussion of the music and aesthetics of contem-\nporary composers from the Balkans, in particular\nof Srdjan Hofman, make me wish to become bet-\nter acquainted with their music. It is to be hoped\nthat we will not have to wait too long before more\nof Veselinovic\u00b4\u2019s writings are made accessible to\nthe Western European public.\nChris Walton\n\uf762\uf76f\uf76f\uf76b \uf772\uf765\uf776\uf769\uf765\uf777\uf773 49\n"}
