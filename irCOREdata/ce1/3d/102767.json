Even with the advent of the psychology of religion, some important research \ntopics and questions have remained marginalized because of the domain\u2019s enthusiastic \nembrace of a positivist-empiricist framework. This article considers what qualitative \nmethods can offer psychological research on religion and spirituality, focusing on the \nchallenges of exploring religious or spiritual concepts and experiences that may prove \ndifficult to capture in language.  \n \nKey words: apophatic theology; psychology of religion; qualitative; religion; religious \nexperience; spirituality; spiritual experience; transcendent; transpersonal. \n \n \nThe relationship between psychology and religion\/spirituality has fluctuated over time, with their \nrespective constitutive primary discourses being constructed sometimes as complementary or at \nleast capable of being comfortably juxtaposed and at other times as competing and inimical (see \nBelzen, 2000, for a detailed history). However, as psychology became a socially legitimate and \npowerful discourse for describing and explaining human minds and behaviours, religion and \nspirituality were not just consigned to the margins of the discipline but were cast into the domain \nof \u2018the inadmissible\u2019. In more recent years, there has been a renewed engagement between \npsychology and religion\/spirituality. In light of this, the present article considers what qualitative \nmethods might contribute to research on psychological aspects of religion and spirituality and \nexamines the challenge of capturing some religious and spiritual concepts and experiences in \nlanguage. First, however, it is necessary to define and review some key terms. \n \nDefining religion and spirituality \nDefining \u2018religion\u2019 and \u2018spirituality\u2019 is no simple task. Even \u2018religion\u2019, which might appear to be \nthe more concrete term, has evaded attempts to define it satisfactorily and in a way that achieves \nscholarly consensus. One useful response is that of Loewenthal (1995) who offered a definition \nby describing several beliefs shared by the major religious traditions, namely a belief in the \nexistence of a non-material (spiritual) reality, a belief that the purpose of life is to increase \nharmony in the world by doing good and avoiding evil and, in monotheistic religions, a belief \nthat the source of existence (God) is also the source of moral directives. Furthermore, she noted \nthat all religions involve and depend on social and institutional organization for communicating \nthese ideas.  \n \nRecent decades have seen a shift away from religion and towards spirituality \u2013 something that \nhas been termed a spiritual or spirituality \u2018revolution\u2019 (Tacey, 2004; Woodhead & Heels, 2004). \nThis has been linked to a \u2018subjective turn\u2019 in the Western world, that is, a turn away from \nexternal\/\u2018objective\u2019 roles, duties and obligations in shaping lives and towards subjective \nexperiences. Claims about a shift to spirituality relate primarily to Western Christianity and \nexceptions can readily be found. However, what is posited is that, as institutional, organized \nreligion loses its appeal (evidenced by the dwindling number of people attending places of \nworship), there has been a (nonparallel) development of less formal, more personal, fragmented \nspiritualities and spiritually-based practices, often drawing upon or connected to Eastern, \n 2\nmystical, esoteric, shamanic and pagan traditions. This has occurred alongside the development \nof a cultural fear and panic about one particular religion \u2013 Islam \u2013 in the West.  \n \nWhen we talk of a shift towards \u2018spirituality\u2019, what we mean by this term can be difficult to \ndefine. Within psychological literature, it is possible to identify (at least) nine dimensions in the \ndefinitions of \u2018spirituality\u2019 offered by various writers (for example, see Elkins et al., 1988; \nEmmons, 1999; Gorsuch & Miller, 1999; Zinnbauer et al., 1997). These relate to meaning and \npurpose in life; a sense of mission or calling in life; a transcendent dimension involving external \nand internal factors such as deities, spirits, inner guides or higher selves; a belief in the \nsacredness of life; an emphasis on wholeness and connectedness; the notion of an essential and \nperhaps eternal soul; the idea of a spiritual journey or path; a belief that pain and suffering are an \ninescapable part of life and may be meaningful; and a belief in personal transformation. Some \ndefinitions seem to offer new terminology and content for concepts that are well developed in \npsychology, philosophy and psychotherapy, such as the focus on meaning and purpose in life. \nYet, as Smith (2006) notes, the meaning and purpose sought within these definitions of \nspirituality lie beyond the material and sometimes beyond the self \u2013 dimensions that may lie \noutside the standard frames of reference of psychology and some domains of philosophy and \npsychotherapy. Likewise, the related concept of \u2018the transpersonal\u2019 has been said to lie beyond \nour usual, individual, rational ways of relating to the world. However, Rowan (2003: 222) \ndifferentiates the transpersonal from spirituality on the grounds that \u2018the divine, the numinous, \nthe sacred, the holy\u2019 are not the sine qua non of spirituality in the way they are for the \ntranspersonal. It is worth noting, though, that such views have been said to represent a \nmisconception that spirituality and related domains have to be focused on the \u2018esoteric\u2019 rather \nthan on material and practical concerns (Eagleton, 2007). \n \nA final key concept that needs to be considered is religious or spiritual experience. In definitions \nof such experiences, Watts (2002) notes that sometimes emphasis is placed on the distinctive \nphenomenological quality of the experience or on the sorts of spiritual realities that are the \nobjects of the experience. At other times, emphasis is placed on the interpretative framework of \nthe person having the experience, so any experience may be deemed religious or spiritual if it is \ninterpreted through a framework of religious or spiritual beliefs. Many qualitative researchers \nwould query the possibility of an uninterpreted, unmediated experience and so this may be an \nartificial distinction. Yet Watts (2002: 91) seeks to retain a qualified version of this possibility, \ncontending that religious experience may be \u2018relatively unmediated\u2019 (emphasis in original) as it \n\u2018may arise from an attempt to free oneself from the usual processes of cognitive mediation\u2019 and \nhence may be less subject to contextual factors than other categories of experience. This is an \ninteresting claim, especially for qualitative researchers who are often highly contextually \nfocused.  \n \nPsychology of religion \nIn recent decades, a sub-discipline has emerged within US psychology that has tried to integrate \npsychology and religion (and, to a much lesser extent, various types of spirituality), leading, in \n1976, to the establishment of Division 36 within the American Psychological Association, \ndevoted to the psychology of religion.1 This domain claims that it approaches religion from the \nstandpoint of psychology, without making assumptions about religious truths and values, and \nconsiders how psychology can enrich understandings of people\u2019s religious beliefs, values and \nbehaviours. In Britain, the psychology of religion only began to gather momentum in the 1990s. \nYet the notable upsurge in publications on psychology and religion, beginning in the early part of \nthat decade, is indicative of a shift in psychology\u2019s interest in religion in both the USA and \n 3\nBritain.  \n \nA range of issues has been explored within the psychology of religion, such as personality and \nother correlates of religious belief, the relationship between religious belief and behaviour, \nreligious belief as a psychological resource in times of difficulty, the social psychology of \nreligious cults, religious conversion and commitment, personal religious experience, the \nrelationship between religion, mental health (and psychopathology) and well-being generally, \nthe role of religion and spirituality in psychotherapy and the importance of social, contextual \nand cultural factors in religious development (see, for example, Beit-Hallahmi & Argyle, \n1997; Loewenthal, 2000; Paloutzian & Park, 2005; Spilka et al., 2003). Much of this research \nhas been conducted within a positivist-empiricist framework, using orthodox designs and \nquantitative methods. This emphasis on quantitative work has occurred even when the positivist-\nempiricist framework does not seem to fit comfortably with the research topic, as in research on \nreligious, spiritual and mystical experiences (see Hood\u2019s, 1975, \u2018mysticism scale\u2019, for example). \nIt could be claimed that this emphasis on the positivist-empiricist framework and quantitative \nanalysis is not surprising, given the historical tensions between religion and psychology and the \nconsequent need for the psychology of religion to establish \u2018scientific\u2019 credibility. Also \nqualitative research has only moved from the margins of British psychology in recent decades (to \ndifferent extents in different branches of the discipline) and this process is unfolding even more \nslowly in the USA. Yet quantitative analyses continue to dominate the psychology of religion \ntoday. For example, in 2006, of the 35 data-based articles that appeared in three major journals \nfocusing on the psychology of religion in the USA and the UK (International Journal for the \nPsychology of Religion, Journal of Psychology and Theology and Mental Health, Religion & \nCulture), 30 offered quantitative analyses (some arising from experimental designs) and five \nwere qualitative. \n \nOf course, it is unfair to complain about the dominance of traditional designs and quantitative \nanalyses because these have often been appropriate to the questions that researchers in the \npsychology of religion have chosen to explore. What we might take issue with is the nature of \nthe research questions that have been posed. It could be said that there has been a tendency to \nfocus on the most readily researchable questions within psychology\u2019s established methodological \nrepertoire. This has marginalized other questions, leaving them only partially examined or on the \nsidelines altogether, such as those involving the phenomenology of religious, spiritual or \nmystical experience and its implications for the intrapersonal, interpersonal and transpersonal \ndimensions of self \u2013 that is, questions that address non-material, non-practical aspects of \nspirituality. There has also been a tendency to conceptualize religious or spiritual experiences \nexclusively in terms of those psychological and\/or psychosocial (mediating) factors that are of \ninterest to a given study, implying that there is nothing authentically religious or spiritual about \nthese experiences (with \u2018authenticity\u2019 here not seen as inimical with interpreted experience) \n(Mental Health Foundation, 2006; Watts, 2002). It is as if researchers are so concerned with \nconstructing their work as unquestionably scientific and psychological that they sometimes end \nup producing research that is reductionist and that brackets what, for many participants, lies at \nthe heart of the research topic.  \n \nQualitative methods in research on psychological aspects of religion and spirituality \nGiven these shortcomings, there is a need to consider what the frameworks and epistemologies \nof qualitative methods can offer (and have provided to) research on psychological aspects of \nreligion and spirituality. However, as is always the case when considering what qualitative \nmethods can offer research on any topic, we need to remember that what determines the \n 4\nquality of a research study is not the method used but the appropriateness of that method to the \nresearch questions, the skill with which the method is applied and the way in which data are \ninterpreted in light of appropriate theoretical concepts (among other considerations).  \n \nWriters on qualitative methods have associated them with various potential benefits, such as \nthe possibility of accessing participants\u2019 meaning-making on their own terms (while \nacknowledging the cultural and other resources from which meaning-making is fashioned), \naddressing process issues and potentially focusing on context in all its complexity and \nfluidity (for example, see Coyle, forthcoming; Willig, 2001). These potentialities can allow \nnew research questions to be explored about topics that have already been examined \nquantitatively within the psychology of religion (and spirituality) and perhaps the exploration of \ntopics that previously have been marginalized and regarded as \u2018off-limits\u2019. For example, the \ncapacity of qualitative methods to permit the concerted exploration of contextual considerations \ncould help in investigating Watts\u2019 (2002) contention that religious experience may be relatively \nunmediated. \n \nPhenomenologically-oriented methods seem most obviously to embody these qualities and to be \nbest placed to perform these functions. Such methods include those that are explicitly and \nexclusively phenomenological (Moustakas, 1994) as well as those in which participants\u2019 \nphenomenologies are a core consideration but where the interpretative role of the researcher is \nalso foregrounded, such as interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) (Smith & Osborn, \n2003), grounded theory (Henwood & Pidgeon, 2006) and some versions of narrative analysis \n(Crossley, 2000). Examples of psychologically-oriented research in which these methods are \napplied to questions involving religion and spirituality are readily available. Wright (2003) used \na phenomenological method to explore the meaning of spirituality among African American \nwomen recovering from substance abuse; Golsworthy and Coyle (1999) employed IPA to \nexamine how older adults used Christian beliefs in meaning-making following the death of a \npartner; Walton (1999) used grounded theory to discover what spirituality meant to patients \nrecovering from an acute myocardial infarction and to identify their perceptions of the role \nplayed by spirituality in their recovery; and Murray et al. (2004) applied techniques of \nnarrative analysis to accounts of spiritual needs provided by people with terminal lung cancer \nor heart failure and their carers. Wright\u2019s (2003) study consistently and vividly reports on and \ninterprets participants\u2019 accounts of religious\/spiritual beliefs and experiences from within \nparticipants\u2019 phenomenological worlds, in keeping with the study\u2019s phenomenological \nmethod. Murray et al.\u2019s (2004) study shares this quality to a significant degree and, unlike \nsome other narrative analyses (for example, see Lindgren\u2019s, 2005, study of Muslims\u2019 \nexperiences of prayer), is not overwhelmed by a focus on narrative structure and function. \nThe studies by Golsworthy and Coyle (1999) and Walton (1999) also provide a clear sense of \nparticipants\u2019 meaning-making around spirituality and religion but some reductionism is \nevident when religious and spiritual beliefs are conceptualized largely as coping resources.  \n \nNote, though, that a desire to foreground participants\u2019 meaning-making and avoid reductionism \ndoes not mean that participants\u2019 accounts should always be taken at face value and should not be \nsubjected to interpretation or critical interrogation using psychological concepts and theory. For \nexample, the nature and location of the border between accounts of some religious and spiritual \nexperiences and \u2018psychotic\u2019 experiences are open to debate but some writers have tried to offer \nclarification (for example, see Clarke, 2001). If a qualitative researcher were analysing accounts \nof religious\/spiritual experiences that seemed to share key elements of the construct of \n\u2018psychosis\u2019, they would be justified in acknowledging this in their interpretations. To avoid \n 5\naccusations of reductionism, depending on the research method used, we might also expect the \nresearcher to consider and offer other interpretations (looking at, for example, the \nmeaningfulness of what may appear to be psychotic elements) and to be critically aware of the \nassumptions of an interpretation in terms of psychosis. Indeed, in any qualitative study of \nreligion or spirituality, the presentation of phenomenological interpretations (in a non-tokenistic \nway) alongside other critical and theoretical interpretations seems an interpretative strategy \nworthy of consideration. \n \nThis would present challenges for research methods founded upon a social constructionist \nepistemology, most obviously discourse analysis (Parker, 1992; Potter & Wetherell, 1987; \nWetherell et al., 2001), but these also have a role to play. Rather than speculating on the \nrelationship between talk about the transcendent and\/or spirituality and the actualities supposed \nby that talk, discourse analysis instead looks at what such talk does, that is, at the rhetorical \nfunctions it performs. This is important for research on religion and spirituality that specifically \nexamines the role of social and cultural processes in the constitution of religious and spiritual \ndiscourses and vice versa. Social constructionist work can show how such discourses (like all \nothers) are infused with ideological assumptions, the interests that are served and those that are \nmarginalized by these discourses and the ways in which the discourses are used in specific \ncontexts. For example, Roth and Alexander (1997) examined how school pupils drew upon \nscientific and religious discourses in talking about controversial issues such as abortion, \neuthanasia and the origins of humankind and considered the implications for pupils\u2019 science \nlearning.  \n \nHowever, social constructionist research on religion and spirituality carries the same risk as \npositivist-empiricist research in that both cannot readily entertain the possibility that there is \nsomething authentically religious or spiritual about whatever topic is being explored. When \napplied to research questions such as those that focus on reports of religious or spiritual \nexperience, an exclusively social constructionist approach would regard the central reported \nexperience as having no \u2018reality\u2019 (whether objective or phenomenological) beyond the \nconstructions of that experience. All is reduced to a product of social constructionist processes \n(but social constructionists would take issue with the description of this as \u2018reductionism\u2019). \nAlthough non-social constructionist methods may find it difficult to capture the heart of the \nexperience (as we shall see later), social constructionism would regard this quest as misplaced \nand would represent \u2018the heart of the experience\u2019 as a construct worthy of analysis in terms of \nrhetorical function. This is not to deny the potential value of the critical analyses that social \nconstructionist approaches can offer psychological research on religion and spirituality. Yet it is \nimportant to consider when these approaches might most appropriately provide one set of \ninterpretations within multiple interpretations of the same data, perhaps within what might be \ndescribed as epistemological \u2018bricolage\u2019 (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005). \n \nEffing the ineffable: can non-material religious\/spiritual concepts and experience be \ncaptured in language? \nWhatever the benefits that qualitative methods with at least some phenomenological emphasis \ncan bestow upon research on psychological aspects of religion and spirituality, there is one factor \nthat can bedevil research on the phenomenology of non-material and non-practical \nreligious\/spiritual experience. This is the difficulty that researchers and, more pertinently, \nparticipants may have in adequately expressing non-material religious\/spiritual concepts and \nexperiences in language. While non-material religious or spiritual experiences may belong to the \ncategory of the non-discursive and so are inarticulable as they occur and perhaps immediately \n 6\nafterwards (see Frosh, 2002, on this category), even fashioning clear accounts of these \nexperiences retrospectively may prove difficult. As qualitative research methods are heavily \nreliant on linguistic data, this may be a serious concern. \n \nThe potential difficulty of capturing religious\/spiritual concepts and (particularly) experiences \nwithin language is not simply concerned with the potential social awkwardness or \nembarrassment that such talk may cause in a largely secular culture. Even those who have \nreligious or spiritual commitments or who work with religious or spiritual ideas can find it \ndifficult to put these ideas and related experiences clearly into words. In recent years, several \ndoctoral trainees in Counselling Psychology at the University of Surrey have, under my \nsupervision, conducted qualitative research on various spirituality-related topics (the studies \nquoted here are by Lynne Gravell, 2007, Iliana Stamogiannou, 2007, and Valerie Suarez, 2005). \nIn this research, interviewees were asked about their understanding of spirituality and they \nrepeatedly responded by emphasizing how difficult it was to define the term. In one study, some \ntherapy clients expressed the view that words inevitably reduced spirituality to rational \nexplanations, intellectual understandings or banalities. As one person said: \n \nI don\u2019t think spirituality is all about words and arguments and mindsets...I think it is \nmuch deeper than that. It is what is in my heart, what\u2019s in my soul.  \n \nAs participants tried to define their spirituality, hesitation and changes of direction were \ncommon in their accounts, as was an emphasis on an unknowable, non-concrete, indefinable \nor uncertain quality to their spirituality, which they did not find a cause for concern: \n \nBut yeah I don\u2019t know there is something else yes and that something is \u2018I don\u2019t \nknow\u2019 and I don\u2019t need to know. It\u2019s there, I have a\u2026I s\u2019pose I have a belief in life \nand the process. I am not really sure. I can\u2019t categorize it in that way but the point is I \ndon\u2019t need to.  \n \nThat\u2019s the big thing about the spiritual dimension \u2013 sort of moving away from \nconcrete materialistic beliefs [ ] and into something which is uncertain and yet at the \nsame time has a positive quality to it. \n \nEven those who were willing to conceptualize their spirituality in slightly more specific terms \noften stressed a dimension that eluded being captured in language: \n \nThe talking about spirituality I think it was finding that and essentially that is \u2013 \nspirituality is about connecting purely and simply and I suppose having some \nacceptance of an unwritten unspoken purpose. Well it doesn\u2019t have to be spoken, it \ndoesn\u2019t have to be written \u2013 it\u2019s just there. \n \nThe difficulties reported and experienced in these studies were a far-from-original finding. For \nexample, in Hay\u2019s (2006) study, 76 per cent of people reported having had a spiritual or religious \nexperience. Although these were often described in terms of an awareness or experience of a \ngeneric \u2018god\u2019, some people had greater difficulty in capturing their experiences in words, \nspeaking of a vague, intuited awareness of \u2018something\u2019 out there which defied precise \nexplanation.  \n \nThese difficulties in expression could be interpreted as pointing to a lack of familiarity with \n 7\nstandard religious and (lay) theological vocabulary, a reluctance to use such vocabulary or the \ninadequacy of such vocabulary to describe the range of human experience of the spiritual and\/or \ntranscendent (especially when wishing to avoid traditional ideas of \u2018God\u2019) in a Western twenty-\nfirst century context. Yet the difficulties are not specific to one historical or cultural setting. For \nexample, apophatic theology has long construed God as ineffable: within this tradition, \nhumankind is represented as being unable to describe the essence of God who is constructed as \ncompletely \u2018Other\u2019 and as ultimately lying beyond human knowledge. This outlook can be found \nwithin Christianity (from early in its history), Judaism, some forms of Buddhism (with caveats \nconcerning the \u2018Divine\u2019) and especially in the Hindu scriptures. Although we are talking here \nabout a tradition that constructs God\u2019s essence as ineffable, this ineffability can legitimately be \nsaid to extend (at least to some extent) to experiences of divine action and of \nconnection\/relationship with the Divine within lives. Hence, from this perspective, it would not \nbe surprising that research participants should find it difficult to capture experiences of\/related to \nthe Divine or the transcendent in words. Rather than being attributable to contextual factors, \nfrom the perspective of apophatic theology the difficulty arises from the nature of their \nexperiences.  \n \nIn accordance with my call for multiple interpretations, a final possibility that must be \nacknowledged is the social constructionist\/discourse analytic perspective on this. Such a \nperspective would consider the functions that are achieved by constructing spiritual\/religious \nconcepts and experiences as difficult to express in language or at least to express with clarity. It \ncould be suggested that this construction positions the speaker as an insider to a mysterious and \nmystical realm that lies beyond the mundane everyday world of language and a possessor of \nprivileged experience: it provides them with a social distinctiveness that may be valued in some \ncontexts. Also, this construction could be said to protect the spiritual\/religious dimension from \ndetailed critical interrogation because the critic is given little to work with. It has even been \ncontended that constructing particular experiences as ineffable is what enables them to be \nunderstood as spiritual or mystical: \u2018ineffability\u2019 is thus constitutive of the category of \u2018spiritual\u2019 \nor \u2018mystical\u2019 experience (Proudfoot, 1985).  \n \nDespite professed difficulties, some people do manage to speak about past non-material \nspiritual\/religious experiences quite eloquently and powerfully \u2013 and not only in well-known \nmystical writings. For example, in Suarez\u2019s (2005) research on views and experiences of \nintegrating spirituality into psychotherapy, some therapists reported being illuminated or \nguided by \u2018the Spirit\u2019 in therapy. They described these occasions as moments of \n\u2018connection\u2019, \u2018spiritual intimacy\u2019, \u2018understanding\u2019, \u2018insight\u2019, \u2018clarity\u2019 and \u2018healing\u2019, in which \nthe Spirit was said to have revealed to them what was going on in the client\u2019s heart, the \nnature of the client\u2019s core pain and\/or what the client needed. For example, one participant \ndescribed something that she interpreted in terms of a \u2018word from the Lord\u2019:  \n \nThe image that came up for me was about her [the client] and a baby and it was \ncompletely unrelated to what she was talking about and I sort of thought about it for a \nlong time and [ ]...I went ahead and said what comes up for me [ ] and then she sort of \nfell apart a little bit and it was all about an abortion [ ] and a baby that never was [ ] \nand it was one of those things that just convinced me that if you are having a really \nstrong what I would call \u2018spiritual sense\u2019 but equally called a \u2018psychological sense\u2019 [ \n], give it a shot and share it and preface it by saying, \u2018This seems to have nothing to \ndo with what you are saying but...\u2019 and the fact that it was such \u2013 it really went to the \ncore of what was painful for her and what was hard for her. \n 8\n \nThis brief excerpt provides a sense of the context and of how the speaker classified this \nexperience. Further gentle probing may have elicited accounts of what she believed was going on \ncognitively, affectively and transpersonally for her (and for her in interaction with the client and \nwith the transcendent) in the moments before, during and after this experience. It is worth noting \nthat therapists who reported these experiences acknowledged the difficulty of determining what \nwas spiritual and what was psychological in these moments of illumination. Given that earlier we \nnoted the possible utility of multiple interpretations in research on religious and spiritual \nexperience, it is interesting that they themselves recognized that other therapists who did not \nhave a spiritual interpretative framework might interpret the same phenomena in terms of high \nquality empathy and good therapeutic attunement.  \n \nSo how can we make sense of professed difficulties in speaking about non-material \nspiritual\/religious experiences existing alongside eloquent accounts of such experiences? It could \nbe that some people are more practised than others at such talk and draw upon existing \ndiscourses from theology, spirituality and\/or mysticism (which are many and varied, as a perusal \nof the \u2018Mind, body and spirit\u2019 section of any sizeable bookshop will reveal) to offer accounts that \nare located within one discourse or that draw upon several. However, sometimes in the data sets \nmentioned above, the same participant would profess difficulty early in the interview but would \nlater offer an elaborated account of their spirituality and spiritual experiences. In a context where \nparticipants may initially have been uncertain about the interviewers\u2019 stance towards spirituality, \ntheir initial accounts of their spirituality may have been hesitant and tentative to avoid \ncommitting themselves to a position from which they may have wanted to retreat if it had been \nmet with any sign of disapproval from the interviewers. Once the safety of the interview context \nwas ascertained, participants may have felt more comfortable in speaking with greater \ncommitment and clarity about their experiences and positions. Yet this pattern was by no means \na universal one: some participants continued to speak in hesitant and tentative terms throughout \ntheir interviews. This could indicate that these participants never felt comfortable within the \ninterviews (an unlikely scenario as the interviewers\u2019 performance was routinely monitored \nclosely and all interviewers were trainee Counselling Psychologists, skilled in sensitive \ninteractions) or it could provide further evidence of the at least partial ineffability of some \nspiritual and religious concepts and experiences. \n \nHow then might a qualitative researcher, seeking to investigate psychological aspects of \nreligious or spiritual experiences, respond to these difficulties? The aim of this article was \nprimarily to outline these difficulties and encourage creative methodologists to continue \nexploring possibilities for accessing non-material, religious and spiritual experiences and \nanalysing them in ways that are psychologically useful and non-reductionist. This may involve \nmoving beyond the accepted repertoire of qualitative psychology. For example, Heron (1998) \nhas advocated what he describes as \u2018long-term lived inquiry\u2019, complemented by short-term co-\noperative inquiry, involving profound, sustained, critical, individual reflection on and \nengagement with the spiritual. However, although the research process involves working \nreflectively with others, Heron holds that the warrant of such inquiry is limited primarily to the \nindividual, which would leave many qualitative psychologists sceptical about its utility. I myself \nhave no easy solutions to the research challenges that I have identified. Nonetheless, while \nrisking an anti-climactic denouement, I wish to offer a reminder about the value of skilfully-\nhandled interviews and a suggestion about the potential value of non-verbal data.  \n \nIndividual interviews allow for the possibility of using the relationship between the interviewer \n 9\nand interviewee as a means of creating a facilitative and respectful research context in which to \nexplore issues that can be difficult to verbalize. If a participant finds it difficult to talk about \nreligious\/spiritual concepts or experiences because they feel awkward, embarrassed and wary of \nbeing judged, the establishment of good rapport between the interviewer and the participant \n(involving the communication by the interviewer of a supportive, sympathetically understanding \nand facilitating stance towards the interviewee) may prove helpful. Even if the difficulty arises \nbecause the essence of the focal issues is not easy to convey within language, good rapport can \nencourage the participant to grapple with this problem. A sensitive and empathic qualitative \ninterviewer can convey an acceptance of hesitations and circuitous reflections and a willingness \nto wait patiently until the interviewee produces an account of their experiences that at least \nprovides some (mediated) approximation (or even some distant echo) of the essence of those \nexperiences. Although this emphasis on good rapport is hardly novel, researchers can feel ill-\nequipped to explore the phenomenology of religion and spirituality, especially if they are \n\u2018outsiders\u2019 to the domain and are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the discourses in terms of \nwhich participants may frame their accounts. Hence it is useful to remind researchers that many \nof the challenges they may experience can be at least partly addressed by the careful use of \nstandard research interviewing skills.  \n \nIn addition, researchers may consider methods of data generation that are non-verbal, at least at \nthe outset (see Braud & Anderson, 1998). For example, they may invite participants to try to \nconvey religious\/spiritual concepts or experiences through drawing or painting, perhaps \nfollowing this with an invitation to discuss the foci of the artwork. Indeed, a participant in \nSuarez\u2019s (2005) study reflected on how such an approach had been used in her psychotherapy: \n \nWe did a lot of art work and clay work and this kind of thing and one of the things [  ] \nwas actually a drawing of what my soul looked like. [  ] I had never been asked [to do] \nthat before and had no idea but I drew something the way you do with these things and it \ncompletely mirrored what was\u2026happening for me on the inside.  \n \nThe analysis of non-verbal data presents challenges for psychological researchers owing to the \npaucity of guidance within the discipline (except in quite specific contexts, such as the analysis \nof children\u2019s drawings within developmental psychology). Yet, material on analysing visual data \nhas begun to appear within qualitative psychology (for example, see Frith et al., 2005) and ideas \nmay also be gained from other disciplines where such analysis is better established \n(anthropology, for example).  \n \nConclusion \nRowan (2001: 8) has claimed that \u2018much of human experience\u2019 \u2013 and perhaps especially some \nreligious\/spiritual concepts and experiences \u2013 lies beyond the reach of research, which he sees as \n\u2018dedicated to the conscious world\u2019. Researchers conducting work on religious\/spiritual concepts \nand experiences certainly need to understand what may be the (professed) limits of what \nparticipants can say about some of these concepts and experiences. Yet pessimism about research \npotentialities in this domain is premature. While currently available \u2018mainstream\u2019 qualitative \nresearch approaches can sometimes struggle, it remains to be seen whether acceptable and \ncredible approaches will be developed which can more readily access the heart of these concepts \nand experiences and increase researchers\u2019 willingness to address them. However, methodological \ncreativity needs to be accompanied by a preparedness to view data through interpretative \nframeworks that take religious, spiritual and theistic dimensions seriously (however that is \ndefined). Such developments would prove invaluable in helping to accord non-material, \n 10\nreligious\/spiritual concepts and experiences a more central, less marginalized position within the \npsychology of religion and spirituality. \n \nReferences \nBeit-Hallahmi, B. and Argyle, M. 1997: The psychology of religious belief, behaviour & \nexperience.
