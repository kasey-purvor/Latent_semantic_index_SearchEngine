We\ndo so by reviewing the different definitions of a BPM system that exist in the literature.\nThrough this work, we aim to open a debate on what are the necessary and sufficient conditions\nof a BPM system. We also hope to encourage a greater level of clarity in the performance\nmeasurement research arena.\nMethodology: We review the performance measurement literature using a systematic\napproach.\nFindings: Based on our research, we have proposed a set of conditions of a BPM system from\nwhich researchers can choose those which are necessary and sufficient conditions for their\nstudies.\nResearch implications: The analysis in this paper provides a structure and set of\ncharacteristics that researchers could use as a reference framework to define a BPM system for\ntheir work, and as a way to define the specific focus of their investigations. More clarity and\n2precision around the use of the BPM systems phrase will improve the generalisability and\ncomparability of research in this area.\nKeywords: Business performance measurement system, performance measurement,\nperformance management, definition, literature review.\nIntroduction\nThe field of Business1 Performance Measurement (BPM) lacks a cohesive body of\nknowledge (Marr and Schiuma, 2003). Management researchers in areas as diverse as strategy\nmanagement, operations management, human resources, organisational behaviour, information\nsystems, marketing, and management accounting and control are contributing to the field of\nperformance measurement (Neely, 2002; Marr and Schiuma, 2003; Franco-Santos and Bourne,\n2005). While diverse and multi-disciplinary research is appealing, it can also foster\ncomplications. These different approaches towards performance measurement have led to\nnumerous definitions of a BPM system2, and there is little consensus regarding its main\ncomponents and characteristics (Dumond, 1994).\nThe lack of agreement on a definition creates confusion and clearly limits the potential\nfor generalisability and comparability of research in this area. This point is well illustrated by\nreviewing the BPM system definitions found in the literature. From an operations perspective, a\nBPM system is mainly perceived as a \u201cset of metrics used to quantify both the efficiency and\n1 This paper focuses on \u201cbusiness\u201d performance measurement systems, as opposed to \u201corganisational\u201d performance\nmeasurement systems. The term \u201cbusiness\u201d is used as a boundary to exclude public and no-profit sector literatures.\n2 The paper focuses on the phrase \u201cBusiness Performance Measurement Systems\u201d as the unit of analysis. It is our assumption\nthat a BPM system is a unique combination of elements. It may be a discrete or explicit system or a collection of existing sub-\nsystems; however, it is the combination of these sub-systems that makes it uniquely a BPM system. The term \u201csystem\u201d in this\nphrase is used inconsistently within the literature. Some of the instances of the term may not be recognised as \u201csystems\u201d from\nsome theoretical perspectives. However, rather than attempt to address these semantic and theoretical differences we have\naccepted all usages of the \u201csystem\u201d term as valid in the contexts of the definitions in which they are used. For a more\n3effectiveness of actions\u201d (Neely et al., 1995); or as the reporting process that gives feedback to\nemployees on the outcome of actions (Bititci et al., 1997). From a strategic control perspective,\ntwo different aspects of a BPM system can be identified. On one hand, it reflects the procedures\nused to cascade down those performance metrics used to implement the strategy within the\norganisation (Gates, 1999). On the other hand, a BPM system is the system that not only allows\nan organisation to cascade down its business performance measures, but also provides it with\nthe information necessary to challenge the content and validity of the strategy (Ittner et al,\n2003). From a management accounting perspective, a BPM system is considered to be\nsynonymous with management planning and budgeting (Otley, 1999).\nThe main purpose of this paper is not to provide another definition; rather, it is to define\nthe key characteristics of a BPM system, based on a review of the definitions found in the\nliterature. To define a concept, it is crucial to identify the necessary and sufficient3 conditions\nfor its existence (Brennan, 2003). This article, therefore, seeks to encourage a debate in the\nacademic and practitioner communities regarding the main elements of business performance\nmeasurement systems. This reflective dialogue will hopefully lead to a shared and\ncomprehensive definition of a BPM system.\nIn terms of more immediate implications for the research arena, we believe that greater\nclarity on what a BPM system comprises could substantially improve the comparability and\ngeneralisability of the research conducted in the field of business performance measurement.\nAs it stands, scholars utilise the phrase \u201cBPM system\u201d without specifying which elements they\nare focusing on, and which conditions are (or have to be) present in the empirical contexts they\ncomprehensive discussion and definitions of the term \u201csystem\u201d, please refer to Checkland (1999); Klir (1991) or Marion\n(1999).\n3 A \u201cnecessary\u201d condition is one without which something cannot be what it is. For example, if something is not a plant, it\ncannot be a flower. So being a plant is a necessary condition for being a flower. A \u201csufficient\u201d condition specifies one way of\nbeing that thing. For example, a daisy is one type of flower; however, not being a daisy does not mean that something is not a\nflower, it could be a rose . So being a \u201cdaisy\u201d could be a sufficient condition for being a flower (Brennan, 2003).\n4study. In order to ensure greater understanding of the research carried out in this field, and the\npossibility of comparing findings appropriately, it is important that researchers make explicit\nstatements of which conditions are considered necessary and\/or sufficient for the existence of\nBPM systems in each study. Furthermore, we believe that comparability, based on thorough\nunderstanding of what every piece of research entails, is a fundamental requirement to\ncontribute to both theory and practice, and ultimately lead to evidence-based management (cf.\nRousseau, 2006; Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006).\nThis article is structured as follows. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive review and\nanalysis of the different definitions of BPM systems that can be found in performance\nmeasurement literature. Secondly, based on our analysis of the definitions of BPM systems, it\nshows the different elements that a BPM system may have. Thirdly, our findings are discussed\nand a set of necessary and sufficient conditions of a BPM system are presented. Finally,\nlimitations and conclusions of our study are outlined.\nMethodology\nDefinitions of BPM systems have been proposed by scholars coming from a number of\ndisciplines. In order to scope the literature review, we followed a systematic method. Firstly,\nwe used two different electronic databases to search for key references on the area of\nperformance measurement. These electronic databases were ABI-Proquest, and EBSCO. We\nsearched those databases using the keyword \u201cperformance measurement system*\u201d4. In the\nformer database we found 2041 references; in the latter, 239. Secondly, we selected the relevant\nstudies coming from these databases. Relevant studies were those that fulfilled the following\n4 A truncation character, *, is used to find articles containing words with the same root. Therefore, a search for performance\nmeasurement system* will find articles containing the words \"performance measurement system\" and \"performance\n5selection criteria: (1) research looking at business performance measurement; (2) research\npublished in peer reviewed scholarly journals; (3) private sector research; and (4) post-1980\nresearch. This last criterion was included because of the change in perspective that took place\nin the 1980s, for which performance measurement moved away from having a pure financial\nfocus to include more comprehensive business characteristics (e.g. Kaplan, 1983).\nOut of the total number of journal articles found, 205 passed our selection criteria.\nSubsequently, we read those articles looking for BPM system definitions. Whilst reading those\narticles, notes were taken about potential cross-references that could be relevant for our\nresearch. Through this process another 132 documents, including not only journal articles but\nalso books, books chapters, conference papers and working papers, were identified and\nincluded. In total, more than 300 documents were reviewed, but the research team came across\nonly seventeen different definitions of BPM systems.\nIn order to assess how widely known and relevant the definitions found in the literature\nwere, we conducted a citation analysis of the papers containing each definition. We used three\ndifferent databases to carry out this analysis5: the Social Science Citation Index, Scopus and\nGoogle Scholar. It must be noted that this type of analysis has a random duplication effect. This\nmeans that the citation of a paper in one database can be found in the other two databases; thus,\nthe summary of citations per paper across the three databases cannot be performed. Clearly the\ncitation analysis we have conducted can be criticised on the grounds that citations are made to\npapers rather than definitions. However, we have assumed that the most frequently quoted\nmeasurement systems\"; but also \u201cbusiness performance measurement systems\u201d, \u201cstrategic performance measurement systems\u201d,\netc.\n5 Three databases were chosen in order to enhance the rigour of our citation analysis. Scopus was selected because it covers\n14,200 publications (including conference proceedings); the Social Citation Index was selected because traditionally it has\nbeen the point of reference for this type of research analysis; finally, the Google Scholar was selected because it is the only\ndatabase that covers the citation of books.\n6articles are amongst the most widely read and hence, if frequently cited papers contain\ndefinitions, these too are likely to be reasonably well known.\nBPM system definitions\nThe definitions selected from the literature and the results of the citation analysis are\npresented in Table 1.\nTable 1: Selected definitions of BPM systems\nCitation Analysis\nAuthor Date Definition\nSocial\nScience\nCitation\nIndex\nScopus GoogleScholar\nAtkinson 1998 \u201cStrategic performance measurement defines the focus\nand scope of management accounting [\u2026] The process of\nstrategic performance measurement begins with the\norganisation\u2019s owners specifying the organisation\u2019s\nprimary objectives [\u2026] Organization planners undertake\nstrategic planning exercises to identify how they will\npursue the organisation\u2019s primary objectives [\u2026] The\nchosen strategic plan results in a set of formal and\ninformal contracts between the organisation and its\nstakeholders [\u2026] The give and take between the\norganisation and its critical stakeholders will define the\norganisation\u2019s secondary objectives.

A PMS can be\nexamined at three different levels. (1) At the level of\nindividual performance measures, the PMS can be\nanalysed by asking questions such as: What performance\nmeasures are used? What are they used for? How much\ndo they cost? What benefit do they provide? (2) At the\nnext higher level, the performance measurement system\nas an entity, can be analysed by exploring issues such as:\nHave all the appropriate elements (internal, external,\nfinancial, nonfinancial) been covered? Have measures\nwhich relate to the rate of improvement been introduced?\nHave measures which relate to both the long and the\nshort term objectives of the business been introduced?\nHave the measures been integrated, both vertically and\nhorizontally? Do any of the measures conflict with one\nanother? (3) And at the level of the relationship between\nthe performance measurement system and the\nenvironment within which it operates. At this level the\nsystem can be analysed by assessing: Whether the\nmeasures reinforce the firm\u2019s strategies; whether the\nmeasures match the organization\u2019s culture; whether the\nmeasures are consistent with the existing recognition and\nreward structure; whether some measures focus on\ncustomer satisfaction; whether some measures focus on\nwhat the competition is doing (p. )\n42 107 234\nRogers 1990 BPM systems can be characterized as \u201can integrated set\nof planning and review procedures which cascade down\nthrough the organization to provide a link between each\nindividual and the overall strategy of the organization.\u201d\n(in Smith & Goddard, 2002, p. 248)\n- 0 24\nOtley 1999 \u201cSystem that provides the information that is intended to\nbe useful to managers in performing their jobs and to\n- 50 136\n10\nCitation Analysis\nAuthor Date Definition\nSocial\nScience\nCitation\nIndex\nScopus GoogleScholar\nassist organizations in developing and maintaining viable\npatterns of behaviour.

Each definition provides a\ndifferent perspective on the concept, and no two definitions agree on the precise characteristics.\nEach of the cited authors defines BPM system from a different perspective, and does so using\ndifferent types of characteristics to derive their definition. Initial analysis of the definitions\nshows that the basis of the definitions is one or a combination of (1) the features of the BPM\nsystem; (2) the role(s) that the BPM system plays; and (3) the processes that are part of the\nBPM system. To be more precise, the features of a BPM system are properties or elements\nwhich make up the BPM system; the roles of a BPM system are the purposes or functions that\nare performed by the BPM system; and the processes of a BPM system are the series of actions\nthat combine together to constitute the BPM system.\nIn order to identify the key characteristics of a BPM system, the seventeen definitions\nfound in the literature were content analysed. Therefore, we conducted three different analyses.\nFirstly, the content of the seventeen definitions was examined in order to identify the main\nfeatures of a BPM system. Secondly, the content of the definitions was examined to identify the\nroles that a BPM system plays in an organisation. Finally, the content of the definitions was\nexamined in order to clarify the processes that take place within a BPM system. Each content\nanalysis was conducted by two different teams of researchers in order to increase the validity of\n11\nthe analysis. The outputs from both teams were shared and discussed, and a definite list of\nBPM system characteristics was agreed.\nCharacteristics of a BPM system\nThe characteristics obtained as a result of the content analysis are presented in Tables 2,\n3 and 4. The left hand column of each table describes the characteristic found in the definitions\nwith the columns showing in which of the definitions these characteristics can be found7.\n7 The letter \u201cX\u201d is included if the definition provided refers to the feature, role or process stated in the first column.\n12\nTable 2: Main FEATURES of BPM systems\nA\ntk\nin\nso\nn\n(1\n99\n8)\nA\ntk\nin\nso\nn\net\nal\n.(\n19\n97\n)\nB\niti\ntc\nie\nta\nl(\n19\n97\n)\nB\nou\nrn\ne\net\nal\n(2\n00\n2)\nFo\nrz\na\n&\nSa\nlv\nad\nor\n(2\n00\n0)\nG\nat\nes\n(1\n99\n9)\nIt\ntn\ner\net\nal\n(2\n00\n3)\nK\nap\nla\nn\n&\nN\nor\nto\nn\n(1\n99\n6)\nK\ner\nss\nen\ns-\nva\nn\nD\nro\nng\nel\nen\n&\nFi\nss\nch\ner\n(2\n00\n3)\nL\neb\nas\n(1\n99\n5)\nL\nyn\nch\n&\nC\nro\nss\n(1\n99\n0)\nM\nai\nse\nl(\n20\n01\n)\nM\ncG\nee\n(1\n99\n2)\nN\nee\nly\n(1\n99\n8)\nN\nee\nly\net\nal\n,(\n19\n95\n)\nO\ntle\ny\n(1\n99\n9)\nR\nog\ner\ns\n(1\n99\n0)\nT\nO\nT\nA\nL\nP\nE\nR\nC\nE\nN\nT\nA\nG\nE\n1.

Planning x\nDiscussion\nThis research has examined a set of BPM system definitions found in the literature on\nperformance measurement in the private sector. The main purpose of looking at BPM system\ndefinitions was to identify the characteristics that are seen as necessary and\/or sufficient for the\nexistence of a BPM system. After conducting a methodical literature review and reading over\n300 documents (including journal articles, books, conference papers and working papers), we\nfound only seventeen definitions of the BPM system concept. This finding has critical\nimplications for the performance measurement literature. It suggests that the majority of\nresearchers in this field do not explicitly define what they are referring to when they use the\n15\nphrase BPM system. This means that it is difficult for readers to know exactly what these\nresearchers are investigating, and hence compare different studies, generalise and draw\nconclusions about the body of research in the field.\nClear understanding and comparability of research is important due to the diversity of\napproaches used to look at performance measurement in organizations. This heterogeneity is\nreflected in the variety of characteristics extracted from the set of definitions analysed. BPM\nsystems have been described according to their features, roles and processes, but none of the\ndefinitions has a common or consistent set of characteristics. Thus, although researchers may\nassume that there is a common understanding of what is and is not a BPM system, this study\nsuggests that this assumption is flawed. As a result, it could be argued that if the performance\nmeasurement field is to develop and become more relevant to theory and practice, then\nresearchers need to be more specific and explicit about the characteristics of the systems they\nare studying. Otherwise, generalisability and comparability of research will be difficult to\njudge, and this has strong implications regarding the development of this field of research and\nits impact on practice.\nAs previously mentioned, there is little agreement concerning the characteristics of a\nBPM system. However, we found some consensus about two features of BPM systems: 53% of\nthe authors mention \u201cperformance measures\u201d; and 35% suggest \u201cobjectives\/goals\u201d as features\nof BPM systems. There is also some consensus regarding five roles of BPM systems: 59%\nconsider \u201cstrategy implementation\/execution\u201d; 41% suggest \u201cfocus attention\/provide\nalignment\u201d, \u201cinternal communication\u201d and \u201cmeasure performance\/performance evaluation\u201d;\nand 35% of authors mention \u201cprogress monitoring\u201d as roles of BPM systems. Finally, there is\nsome agreement concerning one process of BPM systems. That is \u201cinformation provision\u201d,\nwhich has been cited by 53% of the authors. The remaining characteristics found in the\n16\ndefinitions are used by five or fewer people. It is interesting to note that the majority of the\nauthors concentrate on only a few elements from the list. Neely (1998) is the only author to\ncover many of the elements together (citing 51% of the elements in his definition).\nAs discussed in the introduction, in order to define something it is necessary to specify\nits necessary and sufficient conditions. As we have stated, the main intention of this paper is\nnot to create a new definition, but to identify the characteristics that researchers might include\nas necessary or sufficient conditions when defining the BPM systems they are going to use in\ntheir investigations. Thus, which characteristics of a BPM system could be considered key or\nnecessary and which elements of a BPM system could be considered sufficient? This question\nis addressed in the next three sections, building on our findings, and on the knowledge and\nexperience we have in the field of performance measurement.\nFeatures of a BPM system\nFollowing the analyses of the definitions of a BPM system, we could argue that there\nare only two necessary features: \u201cperformance measures\u201d and \u201csupporting infrastructure\u201d. That\nmeasures (also referred to as metrics or data in the definitions) are a necessary requirement for\na BPM system to exist is clearly a tautology. This perhaps explains why so many authors\nneglect to mention them in their definitions. Although the existence of measures is taken as a\ngiven, there is no such agreement on the nature and design of those measures. There has long\nbeen a discussion about the need to include other dimensions of performance than just financial\n(Drucker, 1954; Goold & Quinn, 1990; Johnson & Kaplan, 1987); however there is no\nconsensus on what the other dimensions should be, and in fact the evidence that there should be\n\u2018balance\u2019 in the measures used is far from conclusive (Kennerley & Bourne, 2003). As such, it\nis impossible to define generic types or characteristics of measures that should be included in\nany definition of a BPM system.\n17\nA supporting infrastructure can vary from very simplistic manual methods of recording\ndata to sophisticated information systems and supporting procedures which might include data\nacquisition, collation, sorting, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination (Neely, 1998), and the\nhuman resources required to support them (Kerssens-van Drongelen & Fisscher, 2003). A\nsupporting infrastructure may be an explicit and instantly recognisable system and a set of\nprocesses that have been implemented as part of a discrete BPM system, or might be separate\nactivities within other performance management processes that the BPM system functions.\nTaking into account these two conditions, it could be argued that if a piece of research only\nused performance measures and supporting infrastructure as necessary features of a BPM\nsystem, then a computerised Balanced Scorecard IT system would be enough evidence of the\nexistence of the necessary features, and hence a PMS.\nOne feature that could be problematic as regards to its necessary or sufficient nature is\n\u201cgoals\u201d (often referred to as \u201cstrategic goals\u201d). A common purpose for implementing a BPM\nsystem is to achieve some organisational goals and, very often, this relates to strategic goals.\nFor example, one of the stated objectives of implementing a Balanced Scorecard-based\nmeasurement system is often to achieve an organisation\u2019s strategic objectives. This could be\nexpected, given the relationship between goals and organizational viability (Deming, 1982,\nFeurer and Chaharbaghi, 1995). Given the recent emphasis on strategic performance\nmeasurement systems, it is not surprising that many of the definitions talk about linking\nmeasures to strategy or strategic objectives. However, there are measurement systems within\nbusinesses that will only have operational goals, which may or may not be implicitly or\nexplicitly linked to strategy. Furthermore, a set of financial accounts is undoubtedly a business\nperformance report, and hence the system that produced it is a business performance\nmeasurement system. Nevertheless, there is no specific performance objective, strategic or\notherwise, to which these accounts are necessarily linked.\n18\nRoles of BPM systems\nSeventeen different roles of a BPM system have been identified. However, we argue\nthat the only necessary role is the use of BPM systems to \u201cmeasure performance\u201d. The\nconsideration of this role as necessary is again a tautology. This is probably the reason why\nmany authors do not mention it in their definition. We accept this despite the fact that a number\nof studies argue that significant value is gained from the process of designing performance\nmeasures, regardless of the implementation and data collection phases (Neely et al, 2000). The\nrest of the roles extracted from our analysis can be considered context specific. Therefore, it is\nextremely important that researchers clarify in their studies the different roles that the BPM\nsystem plays in the firms they are investigating.\nIt is interesting to note that organizational learning (Senge, 1990) is not directly quoted\nas a BPM system role, although several definitions refer to some elements of the learning\nprocess. This is surprising, given the centrality of the learning perspective in the Balanced\nScorecard (Sim and Koh, 2001) and in many other management areas such as strategy (Fuerer\nand Chaharbaghi, 1995). Our opinion is that, although it is possible to design, maintain and use\na BPM system without organizational learning occurring, such an outcome is extremely\nunlikely. One of the primary effects of the kind of \u2018self-analysis\u2019 undertaken during system\ndesign is improved knowledge of the organization, and given the iterative and cumulative\nimpact of experience with a BPM system, it is highly likely that learning will occur (Neely et\nal, 2000).\nIn order to help researchers in the process of identifying and selecting the roles of BPM\nsystems that will be the focus of their investigations, we propose five different categories of\nBPM system roles. These are: (1) \u201cmeasure performance\u201d, this category encompasses the role\nof monitor progress and measure performance\/evaluate performance; (2) \u201cstrategy\n19\nmanagement\u201d, this category comprises the roles of planning, strategy formulation, strategy\nimplementation \/execution, and focus attention\/provide alignment; (3) \u201ccommunication\u201d,\nwhich comprises the roles of internal and external communication, benchmarking and\ncompliance with regulations; (4) \u201cinfluence behaviour\u201d, this category encompasses the roles of\nrewarding or compensating behaviour, managing relationships and control; and (5) \u201clearning\nand improvement\u201d that comprises the roles of feedback, double-loop learning and performance\nimprovement.\nProcesses of BPM systems\nBased on our analysis, BPM systems include twelve different processes, out of which\nwe believe that only three could be considered necessary. These are: \u201cinformation provision\u201d\n\u201cmeasure design and selection\u201d and \u201cdata capture\u201d (regardless of how the data capture is done).\nIf a company does not have a specific process for selecting the measures it is going to use to\nassess its performance (even if those measures are imposed by external stakeholders); if it does\nnot have a process for capturing the data to calculate its selected performance measures; and if\nit does not have a process to distribute the results of the performance measurement exercise\n(even if it is with a simple Excel spreadsheet); thus, it could be argued that this company does\nnot have a BPM system.\nIt is important to highlight that even though we consider these three processes as the\nonly necessary processes, it is highly unlikely that some kind of \u201cdata analysis\u201d or manipulation\nwill not be done to sort the data into a meaningful and usable format. Without even limited\nmanipulation the measurement process will be of no value whatsoever. In our opinion, the rest\nof the processes included in Table 4 cannot be considered necessary as they are not critical for\nthe functioning of a BPM system. They are probably beneficial for the effectiveness of a BPM\nsystem, but this discussion is out of the scope of this paper.\n20\nTo further the analysis, we have grouped the processes into five categories: (1)\n\u201cselection and design of measures\u201d, this category comprises the processes of identifying\nstakeholders needs and wants, planning, strategic objectives specification, measures design\nand selection and target setting; (2) \u201ccollection and manipulation of data\u201d, this category\nincludes the processes of data capture and data analysis; (3) \u201cinformation management\u201d, this\ncategory encompasses the processes of information provision, interpretation, decision making;\n(4) \u201cperformance evaluation and rewards\u201d, this category includes the processes of evaluating\nperformance and linking it to rewards; and (5) \u201csystem review\u201d, this category includes the\ndifferent review procedures (these procedures will ensure that there is a feedback loop within\nthe system). All these processes can take place at either organisational, team or individual\nlevels.\nResearchers need to bear in mind that when they specify the features, roles and\nprocesses present in the BPM system they are studying, these specifications will define the\nboundaries of the system, and hence the research being undertaken. The greater the number of\nfeatures, roles or processes to be included in the definition, the more difficult it will be to\ndistinguish performance measurement from other management processes, especially\nperformance management.\nLimitations\nThis research has looked at aspects of BPM systems that researchers have explicitly\nmentioned in their definitions, and it has been conducted by a team of eight researchers, all of\nthem with recognised knowledge and experience in the field of business performance\nmeasurement. However, using this type of method for identifying the main characteristics of a\nBPM system also creates some limitations. Firstly, we have only looked at explicit definitions\n21\nof BPM systems. Although we cannot claim to have developed the complete list of features,\nroles and processes that a BPM system comprises, we have developed a very comprehensive\nlist of BPM system characteristics that researchers could use to define the boundaries of their\nstudies and make their work more transparent and comparable. Secondly, by only considering\nthe definitions created by authors, rather than the meaning of their work as a whole, we missed\nmuch of the nuances provided by each paper. A more holistic approach, albeit necessarily more\nsubjective, may provide greater insights. Further research on this area could improve the\nrobustness of our results.\nConclusions\nIssues related to comparability and generalisability of research have to be addressed if\nwe want to make the field of performance measurement more relevant to theory and practice.\nAs we have shown in this paper, researchers have been looking at BPM systems, often without\nexplicitly describing the specific aspects of the BPM system under study. In the literature it is\nsomehow assumed that the phrase BPM system is univocal. However, as we have shown, there\nis no consensus about the meaning of this phrase, and this situation creates confusion and\ninhibits the development of the field. Therefore, we suggest that researchers need to be more\nspecific and explicit about the characteristics of the performance measurement systems they\ninvestigate. To start doing so, we have reviewed a number of definitions of BPM systems found\nin the literature, and we have discussed several characteristics of a BPM system from which\nresearchers can choose for their studies. With this list of conditions, we hope to encourage a\ncentral debate within the performance measurement field, and to achieve greater level of clarity\nin future studies.\n22\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the EPSRC for support of this project through the research grants: Managing through\nMeasures (grant number GR\/R56136\/01), Evaluating the Impact of Performance Measurement\nSystems (grant number GR\/S28846) and Predictive Performance Measurement: Taking Control\nof Business Processes (grant number IMRC29).\nReferences\nAtkinson, A.A.
