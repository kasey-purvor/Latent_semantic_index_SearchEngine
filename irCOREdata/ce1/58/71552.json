We derive a uniform approximation for semiclassical contributions of periodic orbits\nto the spectral density which is valid for generic period-quadrupling bifurcations in systems with\na mixed phase space. These bifurcations involve three periodic orbits which coalesce at the\nbifurcation. In the vicinity of the bifurcation the three orbits give a collective contribution to\nthe spectral density while the individual contributions of Gutzwiller\u2019s type would diverge at the\nbifurcation. The uniform approximation is obtained by mapping the action function onto the\nnormal form corresponding to the bifurcation. This article is a continuation of previous work\nin which uniform approximations for generic period-m-tupling bifurcations with m 6D 4 were\nderived.\n1. Introduction\nSemiclassical approximations for the density of states of a quantum system can be expressed\nin terms of classical periodic orbits [1\u20135]. The form in which the periodic orbits contribute in\nthese approximations is not unique; it rather depends on the characteristics of the classical\nmotion. Up until now, complete approximations in terms of periodic orbits have been\nderived only for the cases of either integrable or globally chaotic classical motion. In the\nmore general situation of a mixed phase space, difficulties arise due to bifurcations, i.e.\nbecause of the coalescence of two or more periodic orbits as the energy or some external\nparameter is varied. In this article we describe the treatment of a generic type of bifurcation.\nWe derive a uniform approximation for the joint contribution of orbits that participate in a\nperiod-quadrupling bifurcation.\nOne way to derive semiclassical approximations is by starting from Feynman\u2019s path\nintegral and evaluating all integrals semiclassically. The periodic-orbit contributions then\narise from the stationary points of oscillatory integrals. If the periodic orbits are isolated the\nintegrals can be evaluated by a stationary-phase approximation and one obtains Gutzwiller\u2019s\ntrace formula. At bifurcations of periodic orbits, however, different stationary points\ncoalesce and the stationary-phase approximation breaks down. This is because the different\nstationary points cannot be treated separately in the vicinity of the bifurcation. Instead one\nhas to treat them collectively. This is done in terms of certain canonical integrals with the\nsame structure of stationary points.\nThe characteristic arrangement of stationary points in the vicinity of a bifurcation is\ndescribed by its normal form. The generic normal forms for bifurcations in autonomous\nsystems with two degrees of freedom or, equivalently, two-dimensional area-preserving\nmaps have been classified by Meyer and Bruno [6\u20138]. They depend on the ratio m of the\n0305-4470\/98\/010165+19$19.50 c\u00a9 1998 IOP Publishing Ltd 165\n166 M Sieber and H Schomerus\nprimitive periods of the periodic orbits which coalesce at the bifurcation. The corresponding\nbifurcations are named period-m-tupling bifurcations. Ozorio de Almeida and Hannay [9]\nderived transitional (or local) approximations for the contributions of periodic orbits near\ngeneric bifurcations. These approximations are expressed in terms of canonical catastrophe\ndiffraction integrals. They are transitional approximations because they are valid in the\nvicinity of the bifurcation. Further from the bifurcation, however, they do not yield the\ncorrect amplitudes in Gutzwiller\u2019s approximation for the contribution of isolated periodic\norbits.\nIn two previous articles we extended the results of Ozorio de Almeida and Hannay [9] by\nderiving uniform approximations which interpolate between the transitional approximation\nat the bifurcation and Gutzwiller\u2019s approximation for isolated periodic orbits [10, 11]\n(see also [12]). These uniform approximations were obtained by including higher-order\ncorrections to the normal form expansion and then simplifying the integrals by appropriate\ncoordinate transformations. The derivations were completed for the cases m > 4 and m < 4,\nrespectively. In this paper we treat the remaining case m D 4. This case is more complicated\nthan the others since it involves three periodic orbits whose action differences all increase\nwith the same power of the parameter that describes the distance to the bifurcation. We\nuse a different method for the derivation of the uniform approximation than was previously\nused. We apply techniques of catastrophe theory for obtaining uniform approximations for\noscillatory integrals with almost coincident stationary points by performing a mapping onto\nthe normal form [13\u201315]. The motivation is to provide a more elegant derivation; the results\nare, of course, the same for both approaches.\nIn the following section we present the uniform approximation that is derived in\nappendix A and discuss several limiting cases. The result is given for autonomous systems\nwith two degrees of freedom and for two-dimensional area-preserving maps. We apply the\nuniform approximation numerically to the kicked top and discuss the limits of its validity.\n2. The uniform approximation\nThe semiclassical contributions of periodic orbits to the spectral density can be obtained by\nexpressing the density in terms of the trace of the (retarded) Green function,\nd.E\/ D\nX\nn\n\u000e.E \u2212 En\/ D \u2212 1\n\u0019\nImTrG.E\/ (1)\nand evaluating the trace semiclassically in the vicinity of the orbits. If the Green function\nis expressed in a mixed coordinate-momentum representation and the integrals over the\ncomponents of the coordinates along the periodic orbits are carried out one arrives at an\nintegral expression of the form\nd\u0018 .E\/ \u0019 12\u00192h\u00af2 Re\nZ 1\n\u22121\ndq 0\nZ 1\n\u22121\ndp\n1\nr\n@ OS\n@E\n\f\f\f\f\f @2 OS@p@q 0\n\f\f\f\f\f\n1\n2\n\u0002 exp\n\u0014\ni\nh\u00af\nOS.q 0; p;E\/\u2212 i\nh\u00af\nq 0p \u2212 i\u0019\n2\n\u0017\n\u0015\n: (2)\nFor a more detailed derivation of this integral see [10, 11]. In (2) the origin of the coordinate\nsystem is located on a central periodic orbit with repetition number r . Furthermore, p and\nq 0 are coordinates in a Poincare\u00b4 surface of section perpendicular to the orbit, and OS.q 0; p;E\/\nUniform approximation for period-quadrupling bifurcations 167\nis the generating function for the rth iterate of the Poincare\u00b4 map.

Instead one has to integrate collectively over all stationary points which\nare involved in the bifurcation. This is done by inserting the normal form of the generating\nfunction OS.q 0; p;E\/ for the considered bifurcation into (2). For a generic period-quadrupling\nbifurcation the repetition number r is a multiple of 4; we denote in the following l D r=4.\nThe normal form for this case is given by\nOS.q 0; p;E\/ D S0.E\/C q 0p \u2212 \"2 .q\n02 C p2\/\u2212 a\n4\n.q 04 C 2p2q 02 C p4\/\n\u2212b\n4\n.q 04 \u2212 6p2q 02 C p4\/\nD S0.E\/C q 0p \u2212 \"I \u2212 aI 2 \u2212 bI 2 cos.48\/ (7)\nwhere p D p2I cos8 and q 0 D p2I sin8. The parameter \" is zero at the bifurcation. The\nnormal form (7) is obtained from an expansion of the Hamiltonian in the vicinity of the\ncentral periodic orbit, and S0 is the action of this orbit.\nThe generic period-quadrupling bifurcation that is described by the normal form (7)\ninvolves three periodic orbits, a central orbit and two satellite orbits. The bifurcation occurs\nin two different forms depending on the relative magnitude of the two coefficients a and b\nin (7). In the case jaj < jbj there are two real orbits and one complex orbit before and after\nthe bifurcation, the stable central orbit, an unstable satellite orbit and a complex satellite\norbit. At the bifurcation one of the satellites becomes complex and the other becomes real.\nFor jaj > jbj the two satellite orbits are both complex on one side of the bifurcation and\nboth real on the other, where one of them is stable and the other unstable. The central orbit\nis real and stable on both sides of the bifurcation.\nIn the vicinity of the bifurcation, i.e. for sufficiently small values of \", the contribution\nof the orbits can be described by the transitional approximation of Ozorio de Almeida and\n168 M Sieber and H Schomerus\nHannay [9]. It is obtained by approximating the pre-exponential factor in (2) by its value\nat the origin and evaluating the integral with the normal form (7) for the action. This\nyields the semiclassical contribution in terms of the diffraction catastrophe integral for the\ncatastrophe X9. Further from the bifurcation the transitional approximation splits up into a\nsum of separate contributions of Gutzwiller\u2019s type. However, in this limit the semiclassical\namplitudes come out with fixed relationships which are, in general, not in accordance with\nthe periods and stabilities of the orbits. In more detail, the approximation is good as long\nas the following relations between the monodromy matrices and the periods of the orbits\nhold,\n41S21 TrM0 C1S20 TrM1 D 81S21 C 21S20\n41S12 TrM0 C1S10 TrM2 D 81S12 C 21S10\n1S20 TrM1 C1S10 TrM2 D 21S20 C 21S10\n(8)\nwhere 1Sij D .Si \u2212 Sj \/=2 and T0 D T1 D T2. The index 0 denotes the central orbit\nand the indices 1 and 2 the two satellite orbits. Only two of the three equations in (8) are\nindependent. The relations (8) follow from the normal form (7) (cf equations (22) and (24) in\nappendix A). For a general system they are only valid in the vicinity of the bifurcation. With\nincreasing \" they lose their validity, and the transitional approximation gradually becomes\ninaccurate. In order to obtain a formula which uniformly interpolates over the region from\nthe bifurcation up to regimes where Gutzwiller\u2019s approximation is valid (without restrictions\non the semiclassical amplitudes) one has to consider two modifications. First, higher-order\ncorrections to the normal form (7) cannot be neglected any more. However, one can apply\na mapping which brings the exponent in (2) back to the normal form. Second, one has\nto take into account the differences of the values of the exponential prefactor in (2) at the\ndifferent stationary points. These steps are carried out in appendix A. In the following we\ndiscuss the uniform approximation which is obtained there.\nThe uniform approximation for the joint semiclassical contribution of orbits which are\ninvolved in a generic period-quadrupling bifurcation is given by\nd\u0018 .E\/ \u0019 14l\u0019h\u00af2 Re\nZ 1\n0\ndI [T0 C \u000b1I C \u000b2I 2]J0\n QbI 2\nh\u00af\n!\nexp\n\u0014\ni\nh\u00af\n.S0 \u2212 Q\"I \u2212 QaI 2\/\u2212 i\u00192 \u0017\n\u0015\n(9)\nwhere J denotes the Bessel function of the first kind and\nQ\" D \u001bQ\"T0\n4lA0\nQa D Q\"\n2.1S10 C1S20\/\n161S101S20\nQb D Q\"\n21S21\n161S101S20\n\u000b1 D l\u001bQ\" Q\"2\n\"\n.1S10 C1S20\/A0\n1S101S20\n\u2212 1S20A1\n41S101S21\ns\f\f\f\f41S211S20\n\f\f\f\f\u2212 1S10A241S201S12\ns\f\f\f\f41S121S10\n\f\f\f\f\n#\n\u000b2 D ljQ\"j\n3\n4\n\"\nA0\n1S101S20\nC A1\n41S121S10\ns\f\f\f\f41S211S20\n\f\f\f\fC A241S211S20\ns\f\f\f\f41S121S10\n\f\f\f\f\n#\n:\n(10)\nEquation (9) with definitions (10) is invariant under exchange of the indices 1 and 2.\nThe index \u0017 and \u001bQ\", the sign of Q\", can be determined from the Maslov indices of the\nperiodic orbits.

As an important consequence, the joint contribution (9) is still invariant\nunder canonical transformations. The transitional approximation is obtained if one keeps\nonly the first of the three pre-exponential terms in the integrand.\nThere are some special cases of values of Qa and Qb for which the integral (9) can be\nevaluated analytically. They are discussed in appendix B. Numerically useful expressions\nthat can be applied for arbitrary values of a and b are given in appendix C. In the following\nwe discuss different limits of the integral (9). If the action differences 1Sij are large in\ncomparison with h\u00af then a replacement of the Bessel function by its leading asymptotic term\nand a stationary-phase evaluation of the integral yields a sum over Gutzwiller contributions\n(5) for the real satellite orbits. Complex satellites do not contribute since they cannot be\nreached by a steepest-descent deformation of the integration manifold. (A detailed study\nof contributions of complex orbits near bifurcations can be found in [16].) This is sensible\nsince the complex satellites, though having complex coordinates, still have real actions and\nsemiclassical amplitudes (cf equations (22) and (24)), and their isolated contributions would\nnot be exponentially suppressed with h\u00af! 0. (In this respect, the role of the complex orbits\nresembles that of the complex satellite in a period-doubling bifurcation [11].)\nThe contribution of the central orbit is given by the leading semiclassical contribution\nfrom the boundary of the integral at I D 0.\nIn the opposite limit Q\" D 0, i.e. at the bifurcation, all action differences vanish.

T0 and S0\nare, respectively, the period and action of the orbits at the bifurcation, a and b are the\ncoefficients in the normal form (7) for \" D 0, and l D r=4 is the repetition number of\nthe satellite orbits. The contributions (11) and (12) are by an order h\u00af\u22121=2 larger than the\ncontribution of an isolated period orbit, i.e. the singularity index of the bifurcation is 12 .\nAlthough it is not written explicitly, all quantities in (11) and (12) depend on the integer l.\nIn detail, T0;l D lT0;lD1, S0;l D lS0;lD1, \u0017l D l\u0017lD1 and al D lalD1 and bl D lblD1. It follows\nthat the amplitude of the contribution at the bifurcation decreases as l\u22121=2 with increasing\nl. However, it cannot be expected that this approximation is good for arbitrarily large l.\nFor longer periodic orbits bifurcations tend to occur more frequently. It is expected that for\nlarger l there are other bifurcations which interfere with the considered bifurcation.\nThe formulae of this section can also be applied, with minor modifications, to two-\ndimensional area-preserving maps whose time-evolution is governed by the Floquet operator\nF . These maps correspond to systems with one degree of freedom whose Hamiltonian\noperator is periodic in time, H.tCT \/ D H.t\/, and F D U.T \/ is the unitary time-evolution\noperator for one period. The Floquet operator has unimodular eigenvalues e\u2212i\u001ei with phases\n\u001ei that are called quasi-energies. The quasi-energies can be determined from a knowledge\nof the traces of powers of F .\n170 M Sieber and H Schomerus\nFor maps the trace formula approximates TrFn semiclassically instead of the level\ndensity. Furthermore, one has to pay attention to the following differences in comparison\nwith autonomous systems with two degrees of freedom: (i) the orbits which contribute are\nthose with a fixed period n, not those with a given energy E; (ii) the primitive periods have\nto be expressed in units of T and thus are integer valued; (iii) the action is not the reduced\nenergy-dependent one, but depends on time (that is, on the number n); (iv) instead of taking\ntwice the real part, the full complex contribution has to be taken; (v) the results differ by a\nfurther factor of 2\u0019h\u00af.\nIt follows that the contribution C.n\/\u0018 of a period-quadrupling bifurcation to TrFn is given\nby\nC\n.n\/\n\u0018 \u0019\n1\n4lh\u00af\nZ 1\n0\ndI [nC \u000b1I C \u000b2I 2]J0\n QbI 2\nh\u00af\n!\nexp\n\u001a\ni\nh\u00af\n.S0 \u2212 Q\"I \u2212 QaI 2\/\u2212 i\u00192 \u0017\n\u001b\n(13)\nwhere the quantities Qa, Qb, Q\", \u000b1 and \u000b2 are determined by (10) with T0 D n and\nAi D n=.ri\npjTrMi \u2212 2j\/. Here ri and Mi are the repetition number and monodromy\nmatrix of the orbit, respectively.\n3. Numerical results\nWe now test the uniform approximation numerically on the example of a periodically\nkicked top [17\u201319] and compare the results with those for the transitional approximation\n(valid close to the bifurcation) and the Gutzwiller approximation (which treats the orbits as\nbeing isolated). The kicked top is a dynamical system that involves the angular-momentum\noperators Jx , Jy , Jz which satisfy the usual commutation relations [Jk; Jl] D i\u000fklmJm, where\nh\u00af is set to unity. The evolution of the system conserves the total angular momentum\nJ 2x CJ 2y CJ 2z D j .j C1\/. This introduces the quantum number j which fixes the dimension\n2j C 1 of the Hilbert space. j C 12 further plays the role of the inverse of Planck\u2019s constant,\nand the semiclassical limit is reached by j ! 1. After normalization of the angular-\nmomentum vector the phase space of the classical system is revealed as the unit sphere.\nThe specific top that is considered here is described by the Floquet operator\nF D exp\n\u0014\n\u2212i kz\n2j C 1J\n2\nz \u2212 ipzJz\n\u0015\nexp[\u2212ipyJy] exp\n\u0014\n\u2212i kx\n2j C 1J\n2\nx \u2212 ipxJx\n\u0015\n: (14)\nThis describes rotations by angles pi and nonlinear rotations (torsions) of strength ki . For\nthe study of bifurcations we hold the values of the pi fixed (px D 0:3, py D 1:0, pz D 0:8)\nand vary k D kz D 10kx as a control parameter. The classical counterpart of the system is\nintegrable for k D 0 and displays well developed chaos at k D 5.\nAt k D 0 the top describes a linear rotation. In this situation the system has only two\nperiodic orbits, both of period one and positioned at the intersection of the rotation axis with\nthe spherical phase space. They are called the trivial periodic orbits. As k is increased, new\norbits show up in bifurcations. The first two period-quadrupling bifurcations are encountered\nat k D k.1\/ D 1:0055 : : : and k D k.2\/ D 1:1954 : : :. Both have one of the trivial orbits in\ntheir centre.

The central\norbit of this bifurcation is born at a smaller value of k D k.4\/ D 2:4497 : : : in a tangent\nbifurcation together with an unstable partner. The form of the three period-quadrupling\nbifurcations is of type jaj > jbj, i.e. on one side of the bifurcation (k < k.1;2;3\/) both\nsatellite orbits are complex and on the other side (k > k.1;2;3\/) both satellites are real.\nContributions of periodic orbits engaged in period-quadrupling bifurcations first show\nup in the trace TrF 4 since the repetition number of the central orbit has to be a multiple\nUniform approximation for period-quadrupling bifurcations 171\nFigure 1. The trace TrF 4 of the fourth power of the Floquet operator (14) as a function of\nthe control parameter k for j D 4. The plots show the exact quantum result, the uniform\napproximation, the transitional approximation, and the approximation which considers the orbits\nas isolated. One observes that the isolated approximation diverges at the period-quadrupling\nbifurcations while the transitional and the uniform approximation behave regularly there.\nHowever, the transitional approximation starts to break down far to the right of the bifurcations.\nof four. In the following we describe different semiclassical contributions to TrF 4. In\ngeneral, orbits of primitive period one, two, and four enter this trace. Complex orbits\nwith the same primitive periods can also contribute, however, they must be reachable by\na steepest-descent contour deformation. All these orbits can participate in bifurcations.\nOne has to deal with tangent bifurcations of orbits of primitive period one, two, and\nfour, period-doubling bifurcations with central orbits of primitive period one and two,\nand period-quadrupling bifurcations with central orbits of primitive period one. For\n0 6 k . 2:5, however, only a few orbits are relevant, namely, those which participate\nin the period-quadrupling bifurcations at k.1\/ and k.2\/, and in the tangent bifurcation at\nk.4\/.\nIn figure 1 the trace TrF 4 for j D 4 is plotted against k. The exact result is\ncompared with three semiclassical approximations which, respectively, treat the two period-\nquadrupling bifurcations by the uniform approximation, the transitional approximation, and\nthe approximation that considers the orbits as isolated. The tangent bifurcation is described\nin all three cases by the uniform approximation of [11]. Observe that the isolated-orbit\napproximation diverges at the period-quadrupling bifurcations whereas the transitional and\nthe uniform approximation behave regularly there. The transitional approximation, however,\nloses accuracy for the largest k-values in the displayed range, which is most clearly seen in\nthe real part of the trace.\nIn figure 2 we investigate the behaviour of the semiclassical approximations as the\nsemiclassical limit is approached, i.e. we fix the parameter k at k D 1:5 and increase the\nvalue of j . For low values of j the isolated approximation shows large deviations while\nthe transitional and the uniform approximation are accurate. For larger values of j the sum\nof isolated contributions gains validity, since the effective Planck\u2019s constant 1=.j C 1=2\/\nbecomes small in comparison with the action differences of the orbits. The transitional\napproximation on the other hand becomes slightly more inaccurate, since the error in the\nsemiclassical amplitudes shows up more strongly when the orbits can be considered as\nisolated. Figure 2(d ) shows the deviation jTrF 4sc\u2212TrF 4qmj of the semiclassical traces TrF 4sc\nfrom the exact trace TrF 4qm. This function reveals a crossover between the transitional and\nthe isolated approximation and displays the superiority of the uniform approximation over\nthe whole range of j : the uniform approximation is up to an order of magnitude more\naccurate than the other two approximations.\n172 M Sieber and H Schomerus\nFigure 2.

In its essence this\nfunction is a Fourier coefficient of TrFn with respect to j . It allows us to study the\ncontributions of periodic-orbit clusters individually in the case that the action differences\nof orbits from different clusters are sufficiently large. A convenient testing tool is then a\nstudy of the peak height T .n\/.S\/ at the value of the classical action Scl of a given orbit in\na cluster as a function of k or for different values of jmin and jmax in (15).\nIn figure 3 we show a quantum-mechanical evaluation of jT .4\/.Scl\/j2 for the three orbits\ninvolved in the period-quadrupling at k.1\/ as the parameter k is steered across the bifurcation.\nWe use jmin D 1 and jmax D 64. The exact quantum-mechanical curves are compared\nwith results for the uniform, the transitional, and the isolated approximation. The uniform\napproximation is excellent over the whole range of k. It can hardly be distinguished from\nthe quantum result. The approximation in terms of isolated orbits on the other hand fails\ncompletely. It diverges at the bifurcation and only gains validity again for values of k where\nthe amplitudes of the contributions are already quite small. The transitional approximation is\ngood at the bifurcation; however, as k is increased a clear deviation from the quantum result\ncan be seen for the satellite orbits. This result again shows that there is a region where\nthe uniform approximation is essential, since both other approximations, the transitional\napproximation and the approximation in terms of isolated orbits fail or are inaccurate.\nUniform approximation for period-quadrupling bifurcations 173\nFigure 3.

Conclusions\nIn this paper we derived a uniform approximation for the joint contribution of periodic orbits\nthat are involved in a generic period-quadrupling bifurcation. Together with the results\nof [10, 11] this completes the uniform treatment of generic bifurcations in autonomous\nsystems with two degrees of freedom and two-dimensional area-preserving maps. Generic\nhere means that these bifurcations are typically encountered in mixed systems without\nsymmetries as one parameter of the system is varied. They are also called bifurcations\nof codimension one since only one parameter needs to be changed in order to bring the\nUniform approximation for period-quadrupling bifurcations 175\nparticipating orbits into coalescence. In systems with symmetries there can be additional\nkinds of bifurcations. Some of them can be described by small modifications of the formulae\nfor generic bifurcations [11].\nIn the following we discuss the limits of validity of the uniform approximations and\npossible extensions. Although in a generic situation one does not encounter any other\nform of coalescence of periodic orbits than those discussed above, there are still cases in\nwhich the uniform approximations for generic bifurcations have to be modified. The reason\nfor this is that periodic orbits can undergo several subsequent bifurcations. One observes\nfor instance that the iteration of the map corresponding to a normal form describes more\nperiodic orbits of longer periods and allows for additional bifurcations. Another source of\nadditional periodic orbits and bifurcations are higher-order terms in extended normal forms.\nIf the bifurcations occur rapidly one after the other they cannot be considered separately,\nand instead all participating orbits have to be treated collectively. The next step beyond the\nisolated treatment of a bifurcation is the collective treatment of two subsequent bifurcations.\nOften the two consecutive bifurcations can also be considered as being part of a bifurcation\nof codimension two, since the two bifurcations can be brought into coalescence by varying\na second parameter. A collective treatment of two subsequent bifurcations is then necessary\nif one is sufficiently close to a bifurcation of codimension two in parameter space. The\nmethods for obtaining uniform approximations for these cases are, in principle, the same\nas for bifurcations of codimension one; however, the normal forms are more complicated.\nExamples for these normal forms are given in [20, 21], and uniform approximations for\nbifurcations of codimension two can be found in [22, 23]. It is even possible to completely\nsemiclassically quantize a kicked top with low-dimensional Hilbert space by including\nuniform approximations for bifurcations of codimension two [24].\nAs longer and longer periodic orbits are considered, bifurcations tend to occur more\nrapidly and it is expected that then bifurcations of even higher codimensions become\nimportant. This makes the semiclassical treatment of mixed systems more and more\ncomplicated. Applications of semiclassical and uniform approximations in mixed systems\nare therefore most useful in cases where mainly the shortest periodic orbits of a system are\nneeded, for example if one is interested in long-range fluctuations in a spectrum or if the\ncontributions of long periodic orbits are suppressed. Applications of this kind are discussed,\nfor example in [25].\nAcknowledgments\nMS wishes to acknowledge financial support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\nunder contract nos DFG-Ste 241\/6-1 and \/7-2.

Derivation of the uniform approximation\nWe follow in this section a method from catastrophe theory for obtaining a uniform\napproximation for an oscillatory integral with nearly coincident stationary points. By this\nmethod the exponent of an oscillating integrand is mapped onto a standard normal form\nwith the same structure of stationary points. A description of the method and references\nto previous work can be found in [14, 15]. A rigorous treatment including higher-order\ncorrection terms is given in [13].\n176 M Sieber and H Schomerus\nThe contributions of the periodic orbits to the level density are contained in the integral\n(2)\nd\u0018 .E\/ \u0019 12\u00192h\u00af2r Re\nZ 1\n\u22121\ndq 0\nZ 1\n\u22121\ndp g.q 0; p\/ exp\n\u0014\ni\nh\u00af\nf .q 0; p\/\u2212 i\u0019\n2\n\u0017\n\u0015\n(16)\nwhere\nf .q 0; p\/ D OS.q 0; p;E\/\u2212 q 0p (17)\nand\ng.q 0; p\/ D @\nOS\n@E\ns\n@2 OS\n@p@q 0\n: (18)\nThe absolute sign of the mixed derivative of OS inside the square root has been dropped\nsince it is positive near the bifurcation (as can be seen from the normal form (7)). It\nchanges its sign only at conjugate points where the index \u0017 changes as well. By writing\nit without absolute sign the index \u0017 can be kept constant and the additional phase arises\ninstead from the square root when its argument becomes negative. The energy dependence\nof the functions f and g is not written explicitly.\nWe consider in the following the contributions of three periodic orbits to (16) that\nundergo a generic period-quadrupling bifurcation as the energy or an external parameter of\nthe system is varied. We assume that any other stationary points of the exponent in (16)\nwhich correspond to different periodic orbits are well separated from the stationary points\nthat correspond to the periodic orbits which participate in the bifurcation. This means, for\nexample, that the energy or other parameters of the system have to be limited to ranges\nin which the orbits do not participate in any further bifurcation. Under these conditions a\nuniform approximation is derived for the joint contribution of the three periodic orbits.\nNear the bifurcation the generating function OS.q 0; p;E\/ in (17) is approximately given\nby the normal form (7). From this normal form one can obtain properties of the periodic\norbits as is done in the following. First the stationary points of (17) have to be determined.\nThere is one stationary point at the origin which corresponds to the central periodic\norbit. The other stationary points are determined conveniently in terms of canonical polar\ncoordinates I;8 with p D p2I cos8, q 0 D p2I sin8. In terms of these coordinates the\nnormal form is given by\nf .q 0.I;8\/; p.I;8\/\/ D S0 \u2212 \"I \u2212 aI 2 \u2212 bI 2 cos.48\/ (19)\nand the stationary points of f are determined by the equations\n0 D sin.48\/ 0 D \u2212\" \u2212 2[a C b cos.48\/]I: (20)\nThere are altogether eight solutions for (20), four with cos.48\/ D 1 corresponding to\nthe satellite orbit which is labelled by 1 in the following, and four with cos.48\/ D \u22121\ncorresponding to the orbit labelled by 2. The values of I at the stationary points follow as\nI1;2 D \u2212 \"2.a C \u001b1;2b\/ (21)\nwhere \u001b1 D 1 and \u001b2 D \u22121.

The equations (22)\nand (24) entail the conditions (8) which hold for \"! 0. If the distance to the bifurcation is\nincreased (by changing the energy or a parameter of the system) higher-order corrections to\nthe normal form can no longer be neglected, and the dependence of OS.q 0; p;E\/ on q 0 and p\nbecomes more complicated. The main step in the derivation of the uniform approximation\nconsists in the application of a coordinate transformation which then brings the exponent in\n(16) again into the normal form (inside a region in which the stationary points are located)\nf .q 0; p\/ D F.Q0; P \/ (27)\nwith\nF.Q0; P \/ D S0 \u2212 Q\"2 .Q\n02 C P 2\/\u2212 Qa\n4\n.Q04 C 2P 2Q02 C P 4\/\u2212\nQb\n4\n.Q04 \u2212 6P 2Q02 C P 4\/: (28)\nThe parameters of F.Q0; P \/ are chosen in such a way that the mapping from .q 0; p\/ to\n.Q0; P \/ is one-to-one in a neighbourhood containing the stationary points. This can be\nachieved by mapping the stationary points .q 0i ; pi\/ of the left-hand side of (27) onto the\nstationary points .Q0i ; Pi\/ of the right-hand side of (27), which leads to the following\ncondition\nf .q 0i ; pi\/ D F.Q0i ; Pi\/ (29)\nfrom which the parameters Qa and Qb can be determined.\nCondition (29) is already fulfilled for the stationary point at the origin which corresponds\nto the central orbit. For the other stationary points the evaluation of (29) leads back to (22)\nwhere the parameters \", a and b now carry a tilde. Solving these equations for Qa and Qb\nresults in\nQa D Q\"\n2.1S10 C1S20\/\n161S101S20\nQb D Q\"\n21S21\n161S101S20\n(30)\n178 M Sieber and H Schomerus\nwhere 1Sij D .Si\u2212Sj \/=2. Note that the third parameter Q\" of the mapping is not fixed. The\nreason for this is that the form (28) contains one more parameter than is actually needed.\nBy a simple scaling transformation Q0 ! \u0015Q0, P ! \u0015P one can change one of the three\nparameters into \u00061. In analogy to (24) we define Q\" by\nQ\"2 D 2\u2212 TrM0 (31)\nwhich measures the distance to the bifurcation. The sign of Q\" is the same as the sign of\n\" and can be determined from the Maslov indices (26) of the central orbit and one real\nsatellite orbit (if both satellite orbits are complex then \u001bQ\" D \u001b Qa). The difference between\nthe quantities with and without tilde is that those without tilde are obtained from a Taylor\nexpansion around the central orbit whereas the quantities with tilde follow from the mapping.\nFor Q\"! 0 the mapping (27) approaches the identity transformation .Q0; P \/ D .q 0; p\/ and\nthe quantities with tilde approach those without.\nThe mapping (27) transforms the integral (16) into\nd\u0018 .E\/ \u0019 12\u00192h\u00af2r Re\nZ 1\n\u22121\ndQ0\nZ 1\n\u22121\ndP G.Q0; P \/ exp\n\u0014\ni\nh\u00af\nF .Q0; P \/\u2212 i\u0019\n2\n\u0017\n\u0015\n(32)\nwhere\nG.Q0; P \/ D g.q 0; p\/ det\n\u0012\n@.q 0; p\/\n@.Q0; P \/\n\u0013\n(33)\nand the determinant in (33) is the Jacobian of the transformation which will be denoted by\nJ .Q0; P \/ in the following.\nThe uniform approximation is obtained by writing the function G.Q0; P \/ in the\nfollowing form\nG.Q0; P \/ D \u000b0 \u2212 \u000b1 @F\n@ Q\" \u2212 \u000b2\n@F\n@ Qa \u2212 \u000b3\n@F\n@ Qb CH1.Q\n0; P \/\n@F\n@Q0\nCH2.Q0; P \/@F\n@P\n: (34)\nIn order for this representation to be correct, the constants \u000b0; : : : ; \u000b3 have to be determined\nsuch that the right-hand side of (34) has the correct values at the stationary points. The\nlast two terms in (34) vanish at the stationary points. They can be neglected since after\ninserting (34) into (32) they lead to terms which are of order h\u00af smaller than the other terms\nas can be seen by an integration by parts. Furthermore, the constant \u000b3 can be set equal\nto zero, since after inserting (34) into (32) the integral proportional to \u000b3 can be expressed\nin terms of the integrals that are proportional to the other \u000bi , as can be shown by another\nintegration by parts.\nThe remaining parameters \u000b0;1;2 in (34) are obtained by an evaluation of (33) at the\nstationary points. For that purpose the value of the Jacobian J .Q0; P \/ at the stationary\npoints has to be determined. This is done by differentiating (27) twice.

With the\napproximation for G.Q0; P \/ that is discussed after (34) this results in the final expression\n(9).\nAppendix B. Special cases\nB.1. The case S0 D .S1 C S2\/=2\nIn the case where the action of the central orbit is the mean of the actions of the satellite\norbits, the diffraction integral in (9) can be evaluated analytically since Qa D 0. It is a special\ncase of the form of the bifurcation with j Qaj < j Qbj. The first satellite orbit is real if \u001bQ\" D \u2212\u001b Qb\nand the second if \u001bQ\" D \u001b Qb.

The case S1 D .S0 C S2\/=2\nThis is again a case where the integral in (9) can be evaluated analytically. This can\nbe seen by considering the previous expression for the uniform approximation (32) where\nthe integration is performed in terms of the P and Q0 variables. The constants Qa and Qb\nnow satisfy the relation Qa D 3 Qb, and the part of the double integral in (32) with constant\npre-exponential factor splits into a product of single integrals that can be evaluated. The\nbifurcation is an example for the case j Qaj > j Qbj.

Further special cases\nWe briefly discuss two additional cases that occur if Qb D 0 or j Qbj D j Qaj.\nIn the case Qb D 0 the actions of the two satellite orbits S1 and S2 are identical.

The set of stationary points in the normal form (28) corresponding\nto one of the two satellite orbits goes to infinity as Qb approaches \u0006Qa. This normal form is\nnot appropriate for a description of this case and correction terms have to be added to it.\nAppendix C.
