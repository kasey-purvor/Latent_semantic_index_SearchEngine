Development of a Low Voltage Power Booster TWT for a -Band MMPM John Kennedy and Carl Colombo Abstract\u2014Compact millimeter wave amplifiers with output powers ranging from around 20 to 100 W are required for a number of important military and commercial applications. This paper describes the design of a miniature, low voltage, vacuum power booster TWT for a -band (40\u201345 GHz) millimeter wave power module (MMPM). At a design voltage of 7.7 kV and a maximum current of 120 mA, an output power goal of greater than 40 W of CW rf output power has been established for the -band TWT. Beam confinement is provided using an optimized samarium cobalt PPM stack. Circuit losses at millimeter wavelengths are minimized using a novel wire-wrapped, T-shaped BeO rod support structure. Output power is transmitted through a 0.051 cm. thick alumina ceramic output window. High overall device efficiency is achieved through the use of a 3 stage depressed collector. A recently completed engineering prototype produced 51 W of CW power at 41 GHz. Experimental overall device efficiency was 34.5%. These results will be described, as well as ongoing work to further improve overall device performance. I.

INTRODUCTION\nContemporary communications satellites use an array of channel\namplifiers whose frequency bands are set by the system hardware be-\nfore the satellite is launched. This has the disadvantage that the system\ncannot subsequently be reconfigured to meet changing needs during\nthe lifetime of the satellite. A possible solution to this problem is to\nuse broad-band traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) in a Butler\nmatrix [1] to provide a single broadband amplifier capable of handling\nall the downlink traffic. A system using such an amplifier could be re-\nconfigured to carry a variety of carriers having different powers and\nbandwidths in frequency domain multiplex. The amplifier would need\nto have a dc to RF conversion efficiency exceeding 50% without the\ngeneration of unacceptable levels of intermodulation distortion to be a\nviable alternative to existing narrow band amplifiers with efficiencies\nof up to 70%.\nThe individual carriers used in space communication systems are\nnormally phase modulated using a scheme such as QPSK. If it is as-\nsumed that the modulating signals are random, it follows that all pos-\nsible phase relationships between the carriers occur with equal prob-\nability. Thus, the instantaneous carrier power can be greater than, or\nless than, the mean power according as the carriers combine construc-\ntively or destructively. For two carriers, this situation can be modeled\nusing unmodulated signals since all possible phase combinations occur\nwith equal probability during one complete cycle of the difference fre-\nquency of the carriers. For three, or more, carriers, however, it is nec-\nessary to employ Monte-Carlo methods to achieve the results required.\nManuscript received August 20, 2000; revised September 22, 2000.

There is a high probability that\nthe instantaneous power level is 3 dB or more above the mean. If an\nidealized amplifier, whose am\/am curve is linear up to saturation and\nconstant thereafter, were supplied with ten equal phase-modulated car-\nriers it would be necessary to set the mean input power 10 dB below\nsaturation to avoid all nonlinear effects. The result would be that the\nmean output power would be 10 dB below the saturated output power,\nand the efficiency would be reduced to 10% of the saturated efficiency.\nThis loss of efficiency is unacceptable in amplifiers for space applica-\ntions because it leads to increases in the size and weight of the amplifier\nand of the waste energy that must be dissipated as heat. The challenge\nfor the TWT designer is, therefore, to design a tube that can be oper-\nated as close as possible to saturation whilst achieving specified levels\nof inter-modulation distortion. This task requires the ability to predict\nthe inter-modulation performance of each design using computer sim-\nulations.\nII. MODELING THE MULTICARRIER PERFORMANCE OF A TWT\nIt is well known that the performance of a TWT under large-signal\nconditions can be modeled by a Lagrangian analysis in which the elec-\ntron beam is represented by an assembly of discs, or rings, of charge\nwhose motion is tracked under the influence of the RF field of the\nhelix. These models assume a sinusoidal input signal. The computer\nprogram LSM, developed jointly by CEERI and Lancaster University\nincludes multiple input signals, signal harmonics and intermodulation\nproducts provided that a base frequency can be defined which is the\nhighest common factor of all the signal frequencies present [2], [3].\nThe model includes details of the electron beam, and the propagation\nconstant and interaction impedance of the helix slow-wave structure\nat each frequency as a function of axial position in the tube. It can\ntherefore be used to investigate the effects of changes in the design of\nthe TWT on its intermodulation performance with correlated, unmod-\nulated, carriers. It is also possible to study the effects of changing the\nphase relationships between the carriers by varying the input data. Al-\nthough it would be possible, in principle, to simulate TWT performance\nwith multiple, uncorrelated, carriers using this method, the computer\ntime required is generally too great.\nAn alternative approach, which is much less time consuming, is to\nmodel the TWT as a generalized nonlinearity described by its single-\ncarrier transfer characteristics. The program IMAL was developed at\nESTEC for this purpose [4]. Basically, IMAL utilizes an input signal\ndefined in the frequency domain. An initial random phase value is as-\nsigned to each spectral line and the spectrum is converted into the time\ndomain using the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). As we are in-\nterested in the intermodulation falling in the amplifier band, the band-\npass input signal is then converted to a complex lowpass equivalent\none (complex envelope) and this is distorted using the nonlinear char-\nacteristics of the microwave amplifier. A linear interpolation routine\nis used to distort the signal and it is then transformed back to the fre-\nquency domain (FFT) to obtain the desired characteristics. In general\nthe phases of the spectral lines in a multicarrier signal are statistically\nindependent. Hence the output spectrum has to be averaged over many\ndifferent random phase settings of the input signal. For standard non-\nlinear amplifier responses, convergence is generally obtained after 50\nto 500 interations. This approach is valid only for quasi-memoryless\nnonlinear systems, but a well designed microwave amplifier normally\nfalls within this category. It assumes that the transfer characteristics do\nnot vary appreciably over the frequency range to be studied.\n0018\u20139383\/01$10.00 \u00a9 2001 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Single carrier transfer characteristics (a) AM\/AM and (b) AM\/PM.\nIII. COMPARISON BETWEEN IMAL AND LSM\nDetailed analysis of the nonlinearity of a TWT reveals complex\nbehavior in which the trajectories of individual electrons may cross\nover each other so that their positions and velocities are no longer\nsingle-valued functions of the RF phase at which they entered the\ntube. Such crossovers normally begin to occur at approximately the\ninput signal level for which the transfer characteristics are perceptibly\nnonlinear. It is not self-evident, therefore, that the nonlinear perfor-\nmance of a TWT can be represented adequately by an analysis based\non its single-carrier transfer characteristics. A comparison was made\nbetween results obtained using IMAL and LSM for three cases:\n\u2022 two equal carriers;\n\u2022 three equal carriers with phases varied in 60\u000e steps;\n\u2022 eight equal carriers.\nThe TWT simulated comprised a single section without attenuators\nor variations in the helix pitch. Its single-carrier transfer characteristics\nare shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). The AM\/AM curve varied only slightly\nover the band from 10.7 to 12.7 GHz and the variation of phase at\nsaturation was about 10\u000e over the same band.\nA. Two Carriers\nThe performance of the TWT was simulated using LSM with two\ncarriers, their harmonics and the third-order inter-modulation prod-\nucts. Three tests were carried out using pairs of carriers centered on\n11.7 GHz with separations of 200, 400, and 600 MHz. The results ob-\ntained were very similar in all three cases and any differences could\nbe attributed to variations of the transfer characteristics (especially the\nAM\/PM curves) with frequency. The same simulation, with the excep-\ntion of the harmonics, was carried out using IMAL. The results ob-\ntained by the two methods are compared in Fig. 2(a) and (b). It can\nbe seen that there is close correspondence between these two figures.\nThe LSM results show slight separations between the curves for the\nFig. 2. Comparison between LSM and IMAL results for two carriers.\ntwo carriers and the two third-order intermodulation products because\nof the frequency variation in the transfer characteristics.\nB. Three Carriers\nCalculations were carried out using LSM with three equal carriers at\nfrequencies of 11.4, 11.6, and 12.0 GHz and intermodulation products\nat 11.2, 11.8, and 12.2 GHz. The relative phases of the carriers were\nvaried in steps of 60\u000e to make a total of 36 cases. It was found that\nthe total carrier power varied between 49.3 dB and 49.6 dB over the\nrange of relative phases investigated. The variation of the total power\nin the intermodulation products was between 34.0 dB and 37.0 dB.\nResults were obtained using IMAL for the same phase relationships and\nFig. 3(a) and (b) shows the comparison between the two sets of results\nfor correlated carriers and for the average of the 36 phase combinations.\nIt can be seen that there is a close correspondence in both cases. IMAL\nwas also used to generate results for random phase variations and these\nwere found to differ from the case with thirty-six variations by only\nabout 0.1 dB.\nC. Eight Carriers\nFinally, results were computed for eight correlated carriers at inter-\nvals of 200 MHz in two groups of four with a gap of 400 MHz between\nthem. Intermodulation products were computed in the gap between the\ntwo groups and 200 MHz below and above the complete set. The same\ncase was computed using IMAL and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The\ntwo sets of results are in good agreement with each other and the differ-\nences can be attributed mainly to the frequency variation of the transfer\ncharacteristics. It will be noted that the IMAL results show a separation\nbetween the carriers at high drive levels. This is caused by interference\nfrom intermodulation products whose frequencies coincide with those\nof the carriers. It will also be noted that the intermodulation product\nfalling in the gap between the two groups of carriers has an amplitude\n2 to 3 dB higher than those at the edges.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe results presented have shown that there is good agreement be-\ntween the two methods for the cases considered. The differences are\nattributable to the frequency dependence of the transfer characteristics\nof the TWT. It is concluded that the nonlinear performance of a TWT\ncan be computed from its single frequency transfer characteristics and\nthat the results are valid over any frequency band for which these do\nnot vary greatly. It can also be concluded that the task of designing a\nTWT with a specified linearity can be reduced to that of ensuring that\nit has the necessary transfer characteristics.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
