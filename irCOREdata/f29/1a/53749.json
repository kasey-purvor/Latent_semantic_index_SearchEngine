INTRODUCTION\nACCURATE rotor-position information is an essentialrequirement for permanent-magnet (PM) brushless ac\n(BLAC) drives. Thus, either an encoder or a resolver is usually\nemployed. However, this increases the cost and complexity\nand may compromise the reliability. Hence, there has been a\nsignificant development effort on sensorless techniques, which\nestimate the rotor position indirectly from the phase voltages\nand currents.\nVarious back-EMF-based rotor-position-estimation methods\nhave been developed for PM BLAC motors [1]\u2013[3], which all\nestimate the rotor position from the governing voltage equation,\ntheir difference being in the way that the rotor position and\nspeed estimation are deduced. However, they require accurate\nstator-winding inductances and resistances, may be problematic\nat low speed, and cannot be used for starting.\nHence, the most popular sensorless-control method for start-\ning and low-speed operation is based on injecting a high-\nfrequency voltage signal into the phase windings and measuring\nPaper 2008-EMC-206, presented at the 2007 Industry Applications Society\nAnnual Meeting, New Orleans, LA, September 23\u201327, and approved for\npublication in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS by\nthe Electric Machines Committee of the IEEE Industry Applications Society.\nManuscript submitted for review November 22, 2008 and released for publica-\ntion March 26, 2009.

Such a method was orig-\ninally developed for induction motors and was subsequently\nextended to PM BLAC motors with saliency [4]\u2013[6]. The iden-\ntification of the initial rotor polarity, which was not reported\nin [4]\u2013[6], was achieved in [7] and [8] by comparing the sine\nand cosine terms of the second harmonic component in the\nd-axis high-frequency current. In all the foregoing papers, the\nsignal-injection technique was applied to BLAC motors, which\nhave geometric rotor saliency. In [9], it was extended to a\nBLAC motor with a surface-mounted PM rotor by utilizing the\nsaliency which resulted from magnetic saturation. In [5]\u2013[9],\nthe high-frequency signal was injected into the d-axis, which\nwas aligned with the rotor. Alternatively, the high-frequency\nsignals can also be injected into an \u03b1\u03b2-axis [10], [11], which\nare fixed with the stator winding. Since the signals are injected\ninto the \u03b1\u03b2-axis rather than the estimated d-axis, the control\nstrategy in [10] and [11] may be more stable than the other\nmethods.\nHowever, it was found experimentally [5] that the error\nin the estimated rotor position increased with the load cur-\nrent, although the problem was not specifically addressed.\nMore recently, it has been shown in [12] and [13] that the\nrotor-position-estimation error was caused by dq-axis cross-\ncoupling, i.e., Ldqh != 0 and was dependent on the machine\ndesign, although no measures were taken to reduce the error.\nIn [10] and [11], the equivalent machine model was used as\nin [5], except that it was transformed from the dq-axis to the\n\u03b1\u03b2-axis reference frame. When Ldqh != 0, it was described as\nthe \u2018saliency offset\u2019 in L\u03b1h, L\u03b2h, and L\u03b1\u03b2h. It is well known\nthat the mutual inductance between the d- and q-axes (Ldqh)\nof a BLAC motor results from cross-coupling due to magnetic\nsaturation, as shown in [14], by both measurement and finite-\nelement analysis.

ANALYSIS OF ROTOR-POSITION-ESTIMATION ERROR\nCAUSED BY CROSS COUPLING\nWhen cross coupling between the d- and q-axes is consid-\nered, the voltage equations of a BLAC motor, in the rotor\ndq-axis reference frame, are given by [14][\nvd\nvq\n]\n=\n[\nRs + Ldhp \u2212\u03c9rLq + Ldqhp\n\u03c9rLd + Lqdhp Rs + Lqhp\n][\nid\niq\n]\n+q\n[\n0\n\u03c9r\u03c8m\n]\n(1)\nwhere Rs is the stator-winding phase resistance and \u03c8m is\nthe flux linkage per phase due to the PMs, \u03c9r is the angular\nrotational speed, and p = d\/dt. vd, vq and id, iq are the d-\nand q-axis voltages and currents, Ld and Lq are the apparent\nd\u2013q axis self-inductances, respectively, and Ldh, Lqh, Ldqh,\nand Lqdh are the d- and q-axis incremental self- and mutual\ninductances, defined by\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\nLdh = [\u03c8d(id +\u2206id, iq,\u03a6m)\u2212 \u03c8d(id, iq,\u03a6m)] \/\u2206id\nLqh = [\u03c8q(id, iq +\u2206iq,\u03a6m)\u2212 \u03c8q(id, iq,\u03a6m)] \/\u2206iq\nLdqh = [\u03c8d(id, iq +\u2206iq,\u03a6m)\u2212 \u03c8d(id, iq,\u03a6m)] \/\u2206iq\nLqdh = [\u03c8q(id +\u2206id, iq,\u03a6m)\u2212 \u03c8q(id, iq,\u03a6m)] \/\u2206id\n(2)\nwhere \u03a6m is the PM flux.\nDue to magnetic saturation, Ldh, Lqh, Ldqh, and Lqdh vary\nwith both id and iq. By way of example, Fig. 1 shows the\nfinite-element calculated incremental-winding inductances for\nthe interior-magnet BLAC motor whose parameters are given\nin Table I. As can be seen, Ldh and Lqh reduce as id and iq are\nincreased.\nWhen only the high-frequency signal-injection components\nare considered, (1) can be approximated by[\nvdh\nvqh\n]\n=\n[\nLdh Ldqh\nLdqh Lqh\n]\np\n[\nidh\niqh\n]\n. (3)\nEquation (3) can be transformed from the rotor-position\nreference frame (\u03b8r) to the estimated rotor-position reference\nframe (\u03b8er) by the following transformation matrix T (\u2206\u03b8), viz.,\nT (\u2206\u03b8) =\n[\ncos(\u2206\u03b8) sin(\u2206\u03b8)\n\u2212 sin(\u2206\u03b8) cos(\u2206\u03b8)\n]\n(4)\nwhere\u2206\u03b8 is the error in the estimated rotor position, i.e.,\u2206\u03b8 =\n\u03b8er \u2212 \u03b8r is the difference between the estimated rotor position\nand the actual rotor position. Hence, we have (5), shown at the\nbottom of the next page, where{\nLavg = (Lqh + Ldh)\/2\nLdif = (Lqh \u2212 Ldh)\/2 (6){\n\u03b8m = arctan(Ldqh\/Ldif) = arctan [2Ldqh\/(Lqh \u2212 Ldh)]\n!\nLdif =\n\u221a\nL2dif + L\n2\ndqh.\n(7)\nFig. 1.

(9)\nIn the conventional signal-injection-based sensorless\nmethod, cross coupling between the d- and q-axes is neglected,\nand the high-frequency component in the q-axis current is\nassumed to be proportional to the estimation error in rotor\nposition [9]. Therefore, ieqh is forced to zero in order to make\nthe estimation error zero in the conventional method, i.e.,\nieqh = \u2212\nvsig\np\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n)!Ldif sin(2\u2206\u03b8 + \u03b8m) = 0. (10)\nIn this case, an error exists in the estimated rotor position as a\nresult of the incremental mutual inductance between the d- and\nq-axes Ldqh. The error is given by\n\u2206\u03b8 = \u03b8er \u2212 \u03b8r = \u2212\u03b8m\/2 \u2248\n1\n2\narctan\n(\n2Ldqh\nLdh \u2212 Lqh\n)\n(11)\nwhere \u03b8er and \u03b8r are the estimated and actual rotor positions,\nrespectively.\nClearly, the rotor-position error will be zero only when\nLdqh = 0, while the stronger the cross coupling between the d-\nand q-axes, the larger will be the error, as will be shown later.\nIII. IMPROVED SIGNAL-INJECTION SENSORLESS METHOD\nIn [19], the error in the estimated rotor position due to\nthe neglect of the incremental mutual inductance between the\nd- and q-axes Ldqh was analyzed by finite-element analysis\nand experimentally, and a method was proposed to directly\ncompensate for the error by employing (11) based on either\nthe finite-element predicted incremental inductances, Ldh, Lqh,\nLdqh, which are shown in Fig. 1, or using premeasured errors.\nHowever, this improved method was still essentially based on\nthe conventional sensorless method which forces the high-\nfrequency component in the q-axis current to be zero, together\nwith the error compensation.\nIn this section, an alternative method of improving the signal-\ninjection-based sensorless method is proposed to eliminate the\npotentially large error in the estimated rotor position caused by\nthe influence of d- and q-axis cross coupling, i.e., Ldqh != 0.\nRather than forcing the high-frequency component in the q-axis\ncurrent to be zero, as in the conventional sensorless method, an\noptimal relationship between the high-frequency components\nof the d- and q-axis currents is established from the analysis\npresented in Section II.\nWhen the rotor-position-estimation error \u2206\u03b8 is sufficiently\nsmall, (9) can be approximated by\niedh \u2248\nvsig\np\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n) (Lqh \u2212 2Ldqh \u00b7\u2206\u03b8) (12a)\nieqh \u2248\nvsig\np\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n) (\u2212Ldqh \u2212 2Ldif \u00b7\u2206\u03b8). (12b)\nBoth sides of (12a) are multiplied by Ldqh\/Lqh and added to\n(12b) to give\nieqh + \u03bbi\ne\ndh =\nvsig\np\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n) (\u22122Ldif \u2212 2\u03bbLdqh) \u00b7\u2206\u03b8\n(13)\nwhere \u03bb = Ldqh\/Lqh is defined as the coupling factor, which\ncan either be calculated from a knowledge of the machine\nparameters or deduced experimentally, as shown next.\nThus, when the effect of cross coupling is considered, the\nrotor-position-estimation error\u2206\u03b8 can be calculated as\n\u2206\u03b8 =\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n)\np\n(\nieqh + \u03bbi\ne\ndh\n)\n\u22122vsig (Ldif + \u03bbLdqh) = k\u02c6\n\u2206\u03b8\nHF \u00b7\n(\nieqh + \u03bbi\ne\ndh\n)\n(14)\nwhere k\u02c6\u2206\u03b8HF = (L2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif)p\/\u2212 2vsig(Ldif + \u03bbLdqh) is a\ncoefficient which enables the rotor-position-estimation error to\nbe determined from (ieqh + \u03bbiedh).

Comparison of predicted and measured coupling factor (\u03bb). (a) Finite-\nelement calculated. (b) Measured.\n(ieqh + \u03bbi\ne\ndh). Therefore, by forcing (ieqh + \u03bbiedh) to be zero,\u2206\u03b8\ncan be controlled to be zero. Hence, the determination of \u03bb is\nthe key to realizing the proposed improved sensorless-control\nmethod.\nBy definition, the value of the coupling factor \u03bb for various\ncombinations of d- and q-axis currents can be predicted from\nthe finite-element calculated values of Lqh and Ldqh [Fig. 1(b)\nand (c)], as shown in Fig. 2(a). Clearly, the accuracy of \u03bb,\nand, consequently, the accuracy of the rotor-position estimation,\ndepends on the ratio of Ldqh\/Lqh, both Ldqh and Lqh varying\nwith d- and q-axis currents.\nThe coupling factor \u03bb can also be measured directly by\ndriving the BLAC motor by the actual rotor position with\nan encoder, for example. In this way, by injecting the high-\nfrequency signal vsig on the actual d-axis, (3) becomes[\nvsig\n0\n]\n=\n[\nLdh Ldqh\nLdqh Lqh\n]\np\n[\nidh\niqh\n]\n. (15)\nThe corresponding high-frequency d- and q-axis current\ncomponents are obtained from (15) as\nidh =\nvsig\np\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n)Lqh (16a)\niqh = \u2212 vsig\np\n(\nL2avg \u2212\n!\nL\n2\ndif\n)Ldqh. (16b)\nTherefore, it can be seen, from (16a) and (16b), that the\ncoupling factor \u03bb can be obtained from the measured values\nof idh and iqh, as\n\u03bb =\nLdqh\nLqh\n= \u2212 iqh\nidh\n. (17)\nThe measured coupling factor \u03bb for various d- and q-axis\ncurrents are shown in Fig. 2(b). It can be seen that there is an\nexcellent agreement between the finite-element predicted and\nmeasured coupling factors.\nWhile the value of \u03bb to be used in the improved signal-\ninjection-based sensorless method can be determined by in-\nterpolating the data shown in Fig. 2, in order to implement\nthe method on a DSP, the calculation of \u03bb is simplified by\nrepresenting the data in Fig. 2 by the following simple func-\ntion, viz.:\n\u03bb =\n{\u2212k1 \u00b7 ieq, ied \u2265 0\n\u2212 (k1 + k2 \u00b7 ied) \u00b7 ieq, ied < 0 (18)\nwhere k1 and k2 are coefficients. For the BLAC motor un-\nder consideration, k1 = 0.05 A\u22121 and k2 = 0.011 A\u22122 from\nthe finite-element calculated value of \u03bb [Fig. 2(a)], and k1 =\n0.06 A\u22121, k2 = 0.011 A\u22122 from the measured values of \u03bb\n[Fig. 2(b)].\nIn practice, multipliers and low-pass filters are used to obtain\nthe high-frequency d- and q-axis current components, iedh and\nieqh [9], for use in (14) to calculate the error\u2206\u03b8 in the estimated\nrotor position. \u2206\u03b8 is then input to a proportional\u2013integral\nregulator to correct the estimated rotor position \u03b8er and\nspeed \u03c9er . Hence, since the cross coupling is now accounted\nfor in the rotor-position estimation, the accuracy is improved\nsignificantly.\nClearly, when the cross coupling is sufficiently small com-\npared with Lqh, i.e., Ldqh \u2248 0 and, hence, \u03bb \u2248 0, the proposed\nsensorless-control strategy results in ieqh = 0 and is identical to\nthe conventional signal-injection-based sensorless method.\nIV. SIMULATED AND MEASURED RESULTS\nIn order to demonstrate the utility of the improved signal-\ninjection method, both simulated results and measurements\nhave been obtained for the BLAC motor, whose parameters are\ngiven in Table I.\nThe sensorless controller was implemented on a\nTMS320C31 DSP, while a 1024 pulse\/r encoder was used to\nmeasure the actual rotor position \u03b8r. The A\/D sampling and\npulsewidth-modulation switching frequency were both 5 kHz,\nwhile the injected sinusoidal signal was 35 V, 330 Hz. The\ncontrol-loop cycle was 200 \u00b5s, and the measured coupling\nfactor \u03bb, shown in Fig. 2(b) and represented by (18), was used\n(Fig. 3), for which a flowchart is shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 5 shows the estimated and actual rotor position when the\ndemanded rotor speed is changed from \u221210 to +10 Hz, i.e.,\n\u2212200 to 200 r\/min. As will be evident from Fig. 5(a), when\nthe conventional signal-injection-based sensorless method is\nemployed, good agreement is only achieved when the current\nis relatively small, the error in the estimated rotor position\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Paul Stewart.
