The common problems of tension, \nanimosity, even outright conflict, in refugee-host relations add a substantial burden to \nthe numerous other logistical difficulties faced by those engaged in refugee relief.  \nMoreover, attitudes are hardening in many countries where the refugee problem \nshows little sign of abating. This paper contributes to current debates by combining \nrecent livelihoods approaches to refugee studies with a social resilience framework to \nexplore the interlinkages between diverse refugee-host social networks and the \nshaping of refugee livelihood options.  It also considers the way these interlinkages \nimpact on and are impacted on by government, NGO and donor interventions and by \npre-existing local livelihood opportunities.    \n \nSocial resilience is a relatively new concept which emphasises the importance of \nsocial context in coping with adversity.  It can be defined as the ability to cope with \nand adapt to environmental and social change mediated through appropriate \ninstitutions.  In the context of people forced into refugee situations, a social resilience \nframework can be used to understand how people make use (or fail to make use) of \nsocial networks, along with social and cultural institutions (formal and informal) to \ndeal with the situations in which they find themselves.  The importance of moving \nbeyond a purely individual \/ psychological approach to understanding the experiences \nof people in conflict situations has been highlighted in the literature (Boyden and \n 2 \nMann 2000; Hosin 2001; Farwell 2001 etc.). It is argued that an emphasis purely on \nthe individual as the unit of investigation risks missing the ways in which \nrelationships between people can either mitigate or intensify the experiences of \nconflict.  Usually, emphasis is placed on how social networks operate within the \nrefugee community, but social networks at the refugee-host interface can have \nparticular significance and value, especially where the refugee situation is protracted \n(defined as those lasting over five years and with no immediate prospect of solution).  \nBy combining a livelihoods perspective with a social resilience framework in this \nstudy of refugee-host relations, we are able to disentangle some of the complexities \ninvolved in developing a survival strategy which can cope with the exigencies and \nuncertainties of refugee life.  \n \nOur research is mostly set in the context of a refugee camp - Buduburam in Ghana - \nbut it also draws on the experiences of the broader community of NGOs, government \nofficials, a few \u201eintegrated\u201f refugees living outside the camp, and others with whom \ncamp inhabitants interact in their efforts to make a living and reduce their \nvulnerability.  The principal aim of the paper is to explore the way camp-based \nrefugee livelihoods are shaped, in the context of complex social relations between \nrefugees and their hosts. We draw particular attention to language skills, gender and \ngenerational differences and diaspora linkages.  Following a brief review of \ntheoretical perspectives on linkages between livelihood and refugee-host relations, \nresearch methods and the history of Liberian refugee settlement in Ghana, we \nconsider the interplay between personal networks and broader relations with the host \npopulation, through an examination of livelihood strategies.  Finally, we offer some \nspecific, albeit tentative, policy recommendations. \n \nTheoretical perspectives on the linkages between livelihoods and refugee-host \nrelations \nThere is now a considerable literature on refugee-host relations and the impacts of \nrefugees and forced migration on host countries: much of this focuses on livelihood \nopportunities, constraints and competition, because livelihood issues are so central to \nrefugee-host relations in most contexts.   Circumstances in the host country will vary \nfor both host and refugee populations, in the first place depending on whether \nrefugees are put into camps, or whether local integration into rural areas and\/or urban \ncentres is the favoured strategy.   There are studies which show that integration into \nlocal communities can be very effective for both refugees and their hosts, but these \ntend to relate only to specific contexts:  where population densities are relatively low \nsuch that there are labour shortages: where the refugees belong to the same ethno-\nlinguistic group as their host populations, or where there has been a history of \nmovement between the source and host regions (Leach on Liberians in Sierra Leone, \n1992; Bakewell on Angolans in Zambia, 2000, 2002).  In these situations, refugees \nare able to build adequate livelihoods without generating excessive competition and \nconsequent antagonisms with local populations. Integration into large cities or more \npopulous rural regions is often less successful, both for refugees and their hosts, \nespecially where (as often happens) this leads to resource and associated livelihood \nstruggles and\/or the host government imposes complex administrative regulations \nwhich hamper refugee opportunities to make a living (Black and Sessay 1997).    \n \nLarge camps may be particularly unsuccessful, in terms of their impact on hosts, \nrefugees and refugee-host relations (Harrell-Bond 2000) precisely because the impact \n 3 \na large body of refugees together in one place may rapidly become apparent on the \nground.  Some of the ensuing discordance may be due to environmental impacts such \nas vegetation clearance, fuelwood depletion, etc. (Martin 2005), which may have \nindirect livelihood consequences for the host population, while direct social impacts \nmay include undermining local welfare services in the host country by paying higher \nwages and luring away qualified staff.  Moreover, the perceived benefits of regular \nhandouts of food and other goods in the camp can incite envy in poor host \ncommunities (Lawrie and van Damme 2003).  Some now argue that camps, while \nadministratively convenient for UNHCR and host governments, by treating \ninhabitants as dependent passive victims, are a violation of human rights \n(Macchiavello 2003).  However, large camps continue to be the reality of life for very \nmany refugees, including those who form the focus of our study.  \n \nWhether refugees are in camps or integrated in local communities, Akokpari (1998) \nand others point to host governments\u201f perceptions of dangers from refugee influxes, \nsuch as excessive resource pressures and associated environmental degradation, the \npotential of refugees to form a security threat (Jacobsen 2002), and, of particular \nsignificance to this discussion, the possibility that lacking access to formal \nemployment, they may swamp the informal sector or move into illicit activities (sex \nwork, drugs etc.).  The innovative livelihood strategies of refugees (rather than any \n\u201edependency syndrome\u201f) may become the root of host community antipathies \n(Kibreab 1994, Jacobsen 2002).     The differential impact of refugees on individual \ngroups within the host community has also been observed. The potential impact on \nthe livelihoods of poorer hosts was raised two decades ago by Chambers (1986), who \nemphasised the particular dangers in land-scarce, labour-abundant regions.   A more \nrecent study by Whitaker (2002) of refugees in western Tanzania emphasises the \nconsiderable diversity of experience in terms of impact on host livelihoods, showing \nthat host experiences are strongly influenced by their gender, age, class, as well as by \nsettlement pattern, local socio-economic conditions and local host-refugee relations.  \nIssues around social relationships between Liberian refugees and their Ghanaian \nhosts, the linkages between host relations and local socio-economic conditions, and \nthe impact of illicit and\/or innovative livelihood strategies of refugees, are the subject \nof the discussion which follows.  \n \nStudying social networks and related livelihood issues in and around \nBuduburam camp \nOur findings are based principally on a four-month period of field research, mostly \nconducted within the camp, in 2005.  The camp-based research used a multi-method \napproach: twelve focus groups discussions with young Liberians (each with 6-10 \npeople, mostly gender homogenous) seven with older Liberians; 30 in-depth \ninterviews with inhabitants and other key informants (including 8 life histories);  one \ncamp inhabitant\u201fs detailed daily diary (kept for two months), photo diaries kept by \ncamp secondary school students (only two were returned) and researchers\u201f participant \nobservation, including their ethnographic diaries of camp life.  We also drew on \nprevious socio-economic studies of Ghanaians in the same district by one of the \nauthors, interviewed Ghanaians such as the local area traditional chief, the acting local \npolitical leader and various NGO staff working inside the camp, and solicited views \nfrom NGO workers and volunteers of other nationalities assisting camp refugees.  \nSubsequently, we held six focus groups with Ghanaians: one with residents close to \nthe camp, one with traders at nearby Kasoa market, two with younger and older \n 4 \ngroups of Ghanaians (separately) in Accra, and two with younger and older groups in \nKumasi.   Regular meetings were held at the camp in 2005 with a small consultative \ngroup of key stakeholders; mostly Liberians but also some Ghanaians based in the \ncamp.  This was followed by two workshops with camp residents and other \nstakeholders, one to review our preliminary findings, a second after the fieldwork to \nreview our draft final report to the funder and UNHCR. These enabled camp \ninhabitants to comment on the findings, and to make amendments and clarifications.  \nThe findings presented here express the best approximation of the felt and lived \nreality for camp inhabitants we could hope to achieve as outsiders, while recognising \nthat the key stakeholders identified may not fully represent all views (Jacobsen and \nLandau 2003).  \n \nAlthough the research was conducted by two UK and two Ghanaian academics, \nsupported by a Ghanaian NGO leader, there was also a strong input from two Liberian \nfield assistants recruited within the camp.  All interviews were conducted in English, \nsince Liberian-English is the main camp language. The Liberian assistants were \npresent at the majority, but not all, camp interviews, and at all focus group discussions \ninvolving Liberians.  While this raised questions of confidentiality, it was essential to \nour access.  Ethical issues are a substantial concern in refugee research (Jacobsen and \nLandau 2003). They were reviewed prior to the field study by our university ethics \ncommittee, at the camp Consultative Group meetings at the outset of the project, and \nby the research team during the progress of the research.   \n \nThe mix of Ghanaians and Liberians in our research team was particularly fruitful in \nexploring some of the perceived tensions between the two communities, perhaps \nhelped by the fact that this was not initially a prime focus of our research, which \ncentred on the social networks and resilience of Liberian refugee youth and \nintergenerational relations within the camp [XXX forthcoming].  Our Ghanaian \nresearch collaborators started out themselves with concerns about Liberian refugees \n(reflective of views held by the wider population in Ghana and a local press which has \nbecome relatively negative) but their perspectives changed substantially as work \nproceeded in the camp and they participated in its daily life.  Discussions between our \nGhanaian and Liberian colleagues, which developed and deepened as the work \nprogressed, emphasised the importance of understanding the complexities of the \ninterlinkages between Ghanaians and Liberians and associated livelihood concerns \nand outcomes.  This led to additional research with Ghanaians, notably the focus \ngroup discussions within the camp locality and two major urban centres.   \n \nSetting the context: Liberian refugees in Ghana and the development of \nBuduburam camp \nLiberian refugees fleeing civil unrest and persecution have been arriving in Ghana for \ntwo decades.    When the first wave of refugees arrived in Ghana, a National \nReception Committee was quickly constituted, made up of the Ghanaian Ministry of \nMobilisation and Social Welfare along with several NGOs.  Accustomed to dealing \nwith much smaller numbers of refugees, largely from South Africa, Ghana was \nunprepared to handle the great influx of Liberian refugees, and called upon the \nUNHCR for assistance.  To accommodate the refugees, the Ghanaian government \nmade land available at Buduburam in Gomoa District, 35km west of Accra and the \nBuduburam Refugee Settlement was established in 1990.  The majority of Liberians \n 5 \nwere settled in Buduburam, though small numbers went to Accra and other towns, as \nwell as to a much smaller camp near the border with C\u00f4te d\u201fIviore (Dick 2002a, b).   \n \nIt is important to note that Gomoa district where Buduburam camp is located, \nalthough relatively close to Accra, is one of Ghana\u201fs poorest districts.  Earlier work in \nthis coastal savanna district emphasised agricultural problems associated with low and \nunreliable rainfall, high input costs and poor roads.  Another problem, and one \nrelevant to our discussion, is labour shortage.  A vicious circle pertains in Gomoa \nwhereby youth labour out-migration (to areas of cash crop cultivation in the forest \nzones or to urban areas) is encouraged by the relatively underdeveloped state of \nagriculture, and labour shortages help perpetuate low productivity.  From the \nagricultural labour perspective, the influx of refugees might seem advantageous; a \nviewpoint supported by the literature we cited earlier.  However, the majority of \nLiberian refugees in Buduburam are ex-urbanites and other issues, discussed below, \nhave intervened to negate the potentially advantageous demographic context.  \n \nIn the early years material assistance to refugees at Buduburam was provided under \nthe UNHCR\u201fs administrative direction, in partnership with a variety of NGOs.  This \nhappened at the request of the Ghanaian government, who found themselves unable to \nmeet the needs of the large influx of refugees from Liberia.  However, after elections \nwere held in Liberia in 1997, UNHCR Ghana shifted its focus from humanitarian \nsupport to voluntary repatriation (Dick 2002b), but the vast majority decided to \nremain at Buduburam.  During this period, material assistance was significantly \nreduced to all but the most vulnerable refugees, and by June 2000, all UNHCR \nassistance was withdrawn to Liberian refugees, as part of UNHCR regional policy \n(Dick 2002, b). \n \nUnfortunately, the conflict in Liberia re-intensified in the early 2000s, and many \nLiberians had to flee their homes once more, leading to many new arrivals in Ghana, \nparticularly at Buduburam  and in July 2002, the UNHCR re-established a presence \nthere (UNHCR Ghana 2003).  UNHCR no longer gives individual humanitarian \nassistance to asylum seekers and refugees in the camp, with the exception of \n\u201cvulnerable\u201d groups: children and the elderly.  Instead, the aim is to \u201c[work] on a \ncommunity basis to strengthen resources towards greater self-reliance\u201d (UNHCR \nGhana, 2003).  In addition to support from the UNHCR and other international \nagencies, refugees in Buduburam have themselves formed a large number of \ncommunity-based organisations (CBOs), including the Liberian Welfare Council, \nwhich has overall day-to-day responsibility for managing the camp.   \n \nA number of studies have taken place in the Buduburam Refugee Settlement, \nincluding two particularly comprehensive reports by Dick (2002a, b), which focus \nlargely on the ability of the refugees in Buduburam to become self-reliant in the face \nof UNHCR\u201fs withdrawal of humanitarian support.  The principal message of these \ntwo reports is that self-reliance for refugees in protracted exile is both desirable and \npossible.  Although not all refugees have equal economic opportunities, and the \nobstacles to self-reliance for some are considerable, she argues that, on the whole, \nLiberians have been able to support themselves adequately since the gradual \nwithdrawal of humanitarian support.  We will return to these conclusions towards the \nend of this paper.  \n \n 6 \nBy the time we started our research in 2005, the situation in Buduburam was rather \ndifferent from that observed by Dick.  The number of refugees and asylum seekers \nliving on the camp had more than doubled (to around 40,000) since her work in \n2000\/2001.  Unlike the situation observed by Dick, in which the majority of refugees \nin Buduburam had been living for some years under UNHCR support, and thus in a \nreasonable position to become self-reliant as it was gradually withdrawn, the more \nrecent arrivals came at a time when basic humanitarian support was not provided, \nexternal support was insufficient, and Ghanaian hostility had emerged; they have had \nto fend for themselves from the outset.  Camp residents differentiate between those \nwho arrived in the early 1990s, and those who came much later (\u201cfirst semester\u201d and \n\u201csecond semester\u201d), in terms of their livelihood opportunities and ability to cope with \nliving in exile.  For this reason, it is important to re-visit the situation in Buduburam \ntoday, since the self-reliance advocated by Dick may not be achievable by all.  In \nparticular, some of the young people who have arrived unaccompanied by family over \nthe last few years may be especially vulnerable.   Major problems of camp life \nreported in 2005 include unavailability of jobs (mostly limited to the informal sector); \ncost of accommodation; cost of education, coping with healthcare and other living \ncosts; loss of family members and support of elders (such that many of the youth are \nliving alone and support themselves; the numerous girl-mothers are particularly \nvulnerable) and insufficient external support, including recent Ghanaian hostility.  \n \nThe situation in Liberia is gradually improving, following successful elections in \n2005, but economic collapse, extreme poverty and threats to peace and security still \nprevail and corruption is reportedly rife, reinforced by  pervasive unemployment and \ndesperation (McIntosh 2007; Savage 2007) .  Voluntary repatriation to Liberia was \noffered by UNHCR, from October 2004,  but not actively promoted till February \n2006.  The repatriation package was not considered financially conducive and some \nwould be in physical danger if they returned.   By July 2006, 3,500 had returned \nhome, but the majority  are simply staying at the camp, seemingly unwilling either to \nmove back to Liberia or to integrate into Ghanaian society \n(http:\/\/thevisiononline.net\/?p=522, last accessed 05\/09\/2007).   There are currently \naround 38,000, mostly Liberian, refugees at Buduburam (UNHCR July 26 2007, \nhttp:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/cgi-bin\/texis\/vtx\/news\/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&id=44c7783e \nlast accessed 05\/09\/07).   \n \nThe US has represented a beacon of hope: many Liberians have moved there over the \nlast few decades and it is the source of the majority of remittance largesse. However, \nsince 9\/11 immigration has tightened substantially, and the USA and other donor \ncountries are turning their efforts to re-construction in Liberia, rather than accepting \nfurther refugees.  Thus, although for most young people especially, America is the \npreferred option and Liberia a poor second, their dreams are increasingly unlikely to \nbe realised\n1\n.  It is unlikely that camp demographics will change dramatically in the \nnear future since most younger people are set on resettlement in a third country \n(which is unlikely to happen rapidly), while older people who might return to Liberia \nare immobilised by their fear of conditions at home and of returning empty-handed.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n A recent report suggests that 3,600 Liberians living in the US who came there under a special \nimmigration category, Temporary Protected Status, may even be forced to return to Liberia.  \nhttp:\/\/thevisiononline.net\/?m=200708, sourced from  US National Public Radio, accessed 05\/09\/2007. \n 7 \nGetting by: livelihood strategies in Buduburam \nOur field research in 2005 shows that making a livelihood as a refugee living in \nBuduburam is extremely difficult.  Many of the people we interviewed in focus \ngroups seem to have very little to eat, because of the cost.  Free food (provided by the \nWorld Food Programme) was reintroduced in 2003, but only \u201evulnerable groups\u201f- \nchildren and the elderly- are eligible.  (The ground maize provided is an unfamiliar \nfood, generally disliked and sold or bartered to obtain the Liberian staple, rice, or \ncassava).   Camp inhabitants estimate that, of the refugees currently resident in \nBuduburam, just over 10% are employed in the camp formal \/ service sector, and \ninformal economic activities, such as petty trading, and communications (space-to-\nspace) inside and outside the camp, and an estimated 20% personally receive \nremittances from abroad  This leaves the majority (around 60%) with no regular \nsource of income, though many are assisted at least occasionally through the \nremittances received by others within their family or social network. This makes \nliving very difficult and compels some to engage in risky and illegal activities, such as \ncommercial sex work.  While these figures are based only on informants\u201f estimates, \nthey give some indication of the perceived scale of livelihood problems in the camp. \n \nThe fact that people need a Ghanaian residence permit in order to get a formal job \noutside the camp, but then their refugee status is denied, was presented by camp \ninhabitants as a major problem.  The actual situation, according to UNHCR staff in \nAccra is somewhat different: recognised refugees under the 19992 Ghana Refugee \nLaw can apply for and obtain work permits.  However, the process of applying for a \nwork permit is cumbersome and requires refugees to apply to the Ghana Immigration \nService through the Ghana Refugee Board\/Ministry of Interior with a national \npassport or Convention Travel Document, a job offer from a recognised body, a CV \nand a letter explaining the request.  UNHCR reportedly helps applicants to process the \napplications and points out that \u201ecasual, unskilled labour in the informal sector does \nnot in practice require work permits\u201f (Pers. communication, UNHCR staff member, \nAccra, 3 May 2006). \n \nA few well qualified Liberians (nurses, teachers) get work in the camp but for most \nthe opportunities available are extremely limited.  Even those with qualifications \n(such as a health assistant certificate), including teachers, are unable to find work.  \nAccording to Dick (2002b:18), the Ghanaian government does not recognise Liberian \nmedical qualifications and requires health professionals to attend training workshops \nwhich they cannot afford.  The majority of those resident in the camp work either \nwithin its boundaries, or in close proximity, in the informal sector.  Common areas of \nwork range from running one of the many small study classes for children and youth \nwhich take place after school in the camp and offer a small income to young students \nand those who have graduated (around 20,000 cedis per month for primary level \nassistance), to renting bicycles (men), carpentry and masonry work (men), plaiting \nhair (girls), retailing goods (e.g. soft drinks, enamelware) for others or on their own \naccount in the camp (both sexes), or simply selling well water or washing clothes \n(mostly girls).  Some of the hardest physical jobs include working as porters and \nwheelbarrow pushers on construction sites, carrying ice blocks and brick making, all \nof which tasks are done women as well as men: \u201eI must push before I eat\u201f (19 year old \ngirl).  Even very young children help their parents by pushing heavy wheelbarrows at \nthe camp market and at construction sites to earn money for the family.    \n \n 8 \nThe camp market is another potential area for income earning, but again there are \nlimited opportunities.  The market includes both Liberian and Ghanaian traders (from \nAccra mostly), but the majority are Liberian women.  Liberian women traders sell \ngreens and garden vegetables and some dried goods in order to buy their preferred \nfood, rice.  Within the camp market and elsewhere within and around the camp, the \nopportunities for making a living through trade are inevitably limited, given the \nnumbers of would-be traders involved.  There is a limit to the number of businesses \nthe camp can support, especially given the very low average income of its inhabitants.   \n \nAlthough trade within the camp offers some a modest livelihood, the main regional \nmarket at Kasoa seems to be inaccessible to most camp inhabitants, except as a source \nof goods for retail at the camp or as a site for plaiting hair (mostly done by young \nLiberian women).  The camp inhabitants were reportedly initially denied space at \nKasoa by the (Ghanaian) market association there because of overall shortage of \nspace in the market: this led to the subsequent grant of a market on land by the camp \nby the local village chief.  Those who try nowadays to retail at Kasoa reportedly \nsimply do not get customers coming to buy from them, in part because of the \nlanguage problem, discussed below.  However, it is possibly also a matter of being \nblocked by the Kasoa market association, though there is some disagreement among \nLiberian informants on this issue.  \n \nParadoxically, refugees perceive opportunities for earning a living through farming to \nbe limited, despite the agricultural labour shortages in Gomoa district (though many \ngrow a small quantity of vegetables for home consumption). Some people, young and \nold, have managed to earn income by growing crops for sale, such as potato green, a \nproduct much favoured by Liberians, on land near the camp.  However, the land \nmostly seems to have been given out now by its Ghanaian owners, often without \ncharge: for newer residents the opportunities are rare.    \n \nSome Liberians who have managed to access the Ghana education system have \nobtained jobs outside the camp in the formal sector, but others who obtained entry at \nLegon or Cape Coast university are reportedly back in the camp because they could \nnot get jobs.  Low self-esteem is considered part of the problem: \u201eit is a problem of \nmentality, they don\u201ft think they will get anything because they are Liberian. So often \nit\u201fs their own perception, not Ghanaian blocking\u201f (Ghanaian NGO older male \nmanager).  One specific example was cited by a Liberian man who heard a few boys \narguing.  \u201eI advised [one of the boys] .. to go to computer school. The boy said,\u201d I\u201fm \nin Ghana so I can\u201ft do a job with skills\u201d.\u201f (man, late 20s).  \n \nFinally it is necessary to emphasise a point touched on above: the crucial role of \nremittances from family members abroad \u2013 particularly those in the USA.  These are \nan important source of financial support, their benefit extending far beyond the 20% \nof camp inhabitants estimated to receive direct regular remittances,   A regular source \nof envy and dispute, it is difficult to see how the camp economy could continue to \nfunction without them, given the extreme constraints that Liberians face in finding \nemployment outside of Buduburam.   \n \nLivelihoods and illegality \nA range of illegal and potentially harmful livelihood strategies are practiced by camp \ninhabitants: prostitution, selling drugs, robbery (including armed robbery), illegal \n 9 \nelectrical connections and gambling. Such activities may have been less evident when \nDick reported in 2002, though she noted some \u201cprostitution and concubinage\u201d (Dick \n2002b:6) and also observed particular problems associated with \u201eThe Gap\u201f (four areas \nmostly occupied by ex-combatants), a zone considered by some camp residents as \nspoiling the reputation of Liberians among Ghanaians (ibid: 21)\n2\n.   \n \nInevitably these activities raise hostility in the Ghanaian host community, and were \nraised in every focus group discussion held with Ghanaians (though Marijuana \ndealing in some cases seems to be based on supplies from Ghanaian producers).   The \nyouths who referred to (and in some cases admitted themselves pursuing) such illegal \nactivities suggested this was precipitated by hunger, but \u201eyou also want to wear what \nyour friends are wearing so you do things you are not supposed to do\u201f (19 year old \nboy, living alone).  Older people also referred to the materialism of youth as the \nimpetus for illicit activities.  It was suggested that when overseas remittances stop, \nthis is often a trigger for men to move into petty crime such as \u201emoney doubling\u201f.  \nThis may lead on to more serious crimes.  In a focus group discussion with young \nmen about fears for the future, the desire to keep out of criminal activity was \nreiterated by most.  \n \nFor many young girls, the only solution in the face of the pressures on them to support \nparents (and possibly children too) seems to be prostitution: \u201enow 16-year old girls \nare supporting their parents and parents don\u201ft want to know where they get the \nmoney because they use it.  It was different before the war\u201f (31 year old woman).  In \nsome cases girls are involved in prostitution with the agreement\/acceptance of their \npartners because it is necessary to buy food.  Many older people in the camp are \nextremely distressed by this particular problem.  One volunteer with the HIV\/Aids \noutreach programme recounted the story of how he encountered a woman who would \nnot let them meet with her girls, \u201ebecause we may be preventing them from going for \nmoney for her through prostitution\u201f.   \n \nGender and generational differences in livelihood opportunities \nIt is widely agreed by both sexes that it is easier for refugee girls and women to earn a \nliving than for men.  Prostitution (more in Accra, but also in the camp) is one of the \nmost hazardous yet accessible opportunities: \u201eLadies can smile and find support. Boys \nhave to go through hard labour\u201f (young Liberian man working at camp NGO). This \nsame point was made in numerous interviews with men.   Some argue that women\u201fs \nbetter access to job opportunities creates serious tensions in the home because men \nfeel they are unable to fulfil the traditional breadwinner role: \u201eso your control over the \nhouse is slim\u201f. On the other hand, this does not prevent the gender stereotyping and \nsexual harassment which is such a common feature of camp life. \n \nAccess to work seems to vary to some extent with age as well as gender. Many older \nwomen in the camp make tiny sums by trading charcoal, water and other basic items. \nThe ability to speak some Twi is probably an important factor enabling most to do so.  \nOlder men find it hard to obtain jobs unless they are educated and can find work as \n                                                 \n2\n However, our observations in the various \u201eGap\u201f areas suggested that although some \nGhanaians frequent them, they are mostly relatively peaceful areas (though marijuana \nsmoking is fairly ubiquitous there). \n \n 10 \npart of the camp organisation.  Young people with no capital to trade and little \nexperience of trading usually have to depend on their physical strength and tend to \nwork as porters, pushing trucks, making bricks, etc.  For girls the only other option \nmay be hair plaiting, or prostitution.  For those young people who are living in the \ncamp on their own, with no local support network except for friends they have made \nat the camp, the situation is often especially dire. Even for those with family, the \npressures can be intense.  In many cases, young people have to work to support their \nparents: \u201emy mother, she begged people for food and I was ashamed so I decided to \nwork to bring money in\u201f (girl, 19 years); \u201ewhen I lost my mother I started being adult \nbecause my father was having to support three children. I was 15\u201f (girl, 17 years).  In \nsome cases parents or family members are too traumatised to work: \u201esince the war \nshe\u201fs never seen any of the[other]  children. She thinks every day about where her \nchildren are. So I live with mother but I must provide for her and myself. So I can\u201ft go \nto school (25 year old, in the camp since 2000).   Many of the young girls we \ninterviewed had young babies, which made it particularly difficult for them to \nundertake long working days, unless they have family in the camp to help.   \n \nBoth older people and youth suggested that the failure of older people to support their \nchildren after the first few years in camp was a major cause of inter-generational \nproblems.  The point that \u201ethe respect got lost because you can\u201ft feed your children\u201f \n(42 year-old unemployed woman) was reiterated over and over again in our \ninterviews with older men and women.   Given the limited employment available, \nmale identity seems especially threatened because of lack of work, whereas women, \nwe were told, can look after the children, cook, wash clothes etc.   For men, boredom \nis reportedly a big issue: \u201esome do nothing, play ludo, a very pathetic situation\u201f (30 \nyear old man).  Idleness, it was argued at a focus group of older men, leads to evil.  \n \nIt is difficult to ascertain the gender and generational distribution of remittance \nbenefits.  Many young camp inhabitants spend time at the internet cafes, searching for \noverseas sponsors\/support, and although one group of youth argued that remittances \nare more commonly received by older people with children abroad, there was ample \ninterview evidence that young people are in a particularly strong position to receive \nremittances, being more adept at learning the communication skills needed to \nmaintain (and create) relationships overseas:    \u201cEverybody goes to Western Union\u201d \n(focus group with young men).  Our interviews suggest that remittances received by \nyoung and old circulate widely within the camp, across gender and generation, \nthrough gifts and loans to family and friends and through purchases in camp-based \nenterprises (as also reported in Dick 2002b:6).   \n \nThe evolving relationship with Ghanaian hosts and its impact on livelihoods \n \u201eGhanaians think Liberians have money.  Liberians hide their suffering [and]  \npoverty- it\u201fs self-pride\u201f. (Ghanaian NGO staff member) \n \nThe relationship between Liberian refugees and their hosts appears to mirror similar  \nexperiences in other countries, whereby initial kindness has given way to growing \nhostility, commonly related to resource scarcity and security problems (Jacobsen \n2002: 591).   Because economic opportunities for the Liberian refugees in Ghana are \nvery limited, and even essential public services are fee-paying, the majority of the \ninhabitants of Buduburam rely on social networks and other forms of social support to \nprovide them with material or other kinds of help in times of need. Social networks to \n 11 \nlocal Ghanaian host communities can play a crucial role in achieving livelihood \nimprovement, but the potential and willingness to develop and nurture such networks \ndepends on a range of factors relating to refugees\u201f age, sex and broader attitudes to \nresidence in Ghana and to corresponding attitudes in the host population, as we \nillustrate below. \n \nGhanaians and Liberians have interacted for centuries and many Ghanaians were \nresident in Liberia before the war started.  Perhaps in part because of this familiarity \n(especially through trade, less commonly through intermarriage), in the early years \nwhen Liberian refugees entered Ghana much help was offered to them by local people \nand relations with the Ghanaian population in general were excellent. Some people at \nthe camp were reportedly even evacuated from Liberia by the Ghana government \nwhen they were evacuating Ghanaian nationals. Before the camp was built, villagers \nat Buduburam took Liberians into their own homes: \u201ethey accepted me and opened \ntheir hearts to me\u201f (30 year old woman).  We heard that many unaccompanied \nchildren were taken by Ghanaians to live with them and are \u201enow growing up in \nGhanaian homes\u201f. \n \nReports of individual kindnesses, especially in the early years of the camp, are \nnumerous.  One boy described how he started to earn a small income from growing \npotato-greens on land belonging to an elderly Ghanaian man near the camp.  When \nthe man first saw the boy with other Liberians on his land he fetched the police, but \n\u201ewe talked to him and then he understood\u201f. The land had been used illegally by sand-\nwinners and he was pleased when the cultivation stopped it.  He not only allowed the \nLiberians to farm but did not charge them for using the land.   Another man had lived \nwith a Ghanaian woman in a nearby village and she had found him land to lease. \nThroughout his time there he had \u201every cordial relations\u2026. I was put in total charge \n[of the house]\u201f. Another man explained how an elder in the Pentecostal church in \nKasoa had lent him mattresses for himself and his children, visited him regularly, \ngave him money, food and advice, even bought him an alarm for his door.  Many \nothers mentioned being given goods to sell on [easy] credit, being rented houses at \nreduced rates, and children being sponsored in school by Ghanaians: \u201eI met a \nGhanaian who is paying my daughter\u201fs school fees.   This is the [only] positive thing I \nhave\u201e (38 year old unemployed man).  \n \nFormal institutions including Ghanaian schools and churches also continue to play a \nvital role.  At first the Ghanaian churches brought food on rota to the camp and took \nclose care and interest in individual families. They still help directly and indirectly \nthrough links with the many Liberian churches at the camp.  The churches not only \nprovide for spiritual needs but also give material help: \u201ethey always help you if you \nare in need\u201f (daughter of Liberian pastor), \u201ethey supply us with clothes for church\u201f \n(young girl).   Many camp children are at Ghanaian schools, where they pay the same \nfees as Ghanaians (as opposed to higher fees for foreigners).  These schools \nreportedly have better facilities and more qualified staff than those on the camp.  \nHowever, in nursing schools in Ghana, Liberians have to pay overseas fees.  Refugees \nat the University of Ghana are eligible for reduced fees (40% of the overseas rate), but \nmost cannot afford even that. \n \nMany positive individual interactions continue between camp inhabitants and \nGhanaians. Liberians interact with Ghanaians if they attend Ghanaian schools outside \n 12 \nthe camp, sometimes through trading in markets, through sporting activities, through \nreligious meetings and on excursions to the beach. Such meetings may lead to \nfriendship, invitations to funerals and weddings and to material help.  Some people on \nthe camp also have temporary liaisons with Ghanaians and may have children from \nthese temporary unions, though there is reportedly only limited intermarriage with \nGhanaians.  Nonetheless, we were widely informed by both Ghanaians and Liberians \nthat, in recent years, some of these good relations between Liberians and Ghanaians \nhave deteriorated.   Thus, whereas the Ghanaian churches at first brought food on rota \nto the camp, took close care and interest in individual families etc., their connections \nhave tended to cool as crime increased and reports about wife-snatching by Liberians \ngrew. This cooling of relations is of major concern to many Liberians at the camp.  \nDuring initial discussions about potential participants for our end of study workshop \nwe were advised by the chairwoman of the Welfare Council that the crucial invitees \nwere the press, \u201eto correct wrong perceptions of Ghanaians about camp inhabitants\u201f.    \n \nPerspectives of camp inhabitants regarding relationships with Ghanaians \nOn the Liberian side, opinions in the camp vary as to the scale of conflict or hostility \nbetween Liberians and local Ghanaians, with some blaming the media for \nexaggerating reports of hostility.  In general, however, explanations for the \ndeterioration in Libero-Ghanaian relationships among different age groups are rather \nsimilar and tend to put more emphasis on Liberian than Ghanaian failings.  \n \nOlder Liberians argued that style, manners and actual and perceived vice perpetrated \nby the Liberian refugees at the camp were often at the heart of current antagonisms, \nwhich appear to be directed particularly at Liberian youth. Incidents such as theft of \nGhanaian traders\u201f goods in the camp market bring \u201ehassle in the heart\u201f (Liberian \nmiddle-aged male trader).   An elderly Liberian man who works in a formal position \nat the camp contrasted Ghanaian society where there is \u201ehumbleness and respect for \nadults\u201f with young Liberians who had been brought up very differently.   This lack of \nunderstanding of the need for respect among Liberian youth was reiterated by a \nnumber of older Liberians.  Trauma and loss of parental care were  raised as major \ncauses, though a number of older people also suggested this was compounded by \nlong-standing differences between Ghanaians and Liberians associated with \ntemperament (the greater impatience of most Liberians), different traditions of \nchieftaincy (less honour to traditional leaders in Liberia), the fascination of youth with \neverything Western\/American, lack of national identity and  a different style of \n(colonial-influenced) education.  \n \nThe problem of conspicuous consumption by some young Liberians was specifically \nidentified by older Liberians as an issue they felt affected relations with Ghanaians.  \nThey suggested it raised resentment among Ghanaians who seemed to perceive that \nGhana was subsidising the camp. They would thus charge Liberians more in the \nmarket \u201ebecause they think you are getting free money\u201f (Consultative Group meeting, \nApril 2005).   \n \nYounger Liberians were also aware of the way Liberian attitudes and their own \ninteraction led to hostility in the host community: \u201eour people need to be educated so \nthey know when you are a refugee you have some limits; you don\u201ft have rights over \nthe original owners of the land\u201f (Consultative group, April 2005).  The view that \nLiberians are violent people was expressed by young Liberians too:  \u201eLiberians \n 13 \nnowadays are violent by nature\u2026.the attitude of being polite has gone away\u2026 the \nsystem is a tarnished system\u201f (young Liberian man).  A few referred to the need to \nlearn from the host nation.   \n \nThere was some concern expressed among younger Liberians that they were \nunwittingly breaking Ghanaian rules and conventions. One young man told a sorry \nstory: \u201eif there is maybe a law or something they don\u201ft want us to do they should tell \nus so we know it\u201fs against the norms. Unknowingly, you fall into the trap. I was using \nprivate KVIP [lavatory].. I went far into the bush but I didn\u201ft know there was a law \nnot to go there.  I saw them surrounding me\u2026 they said they were taking me to the \nChief.  I said sorry, I didn\u201ft know.  I\u201fd been friends with some of them before, I\u201fd \ninteracted with some of them. They beat me with sticks. I still have bruises\u201f.  He \nsuggested that the local Chiefs needed to ensure the village youths told the camp \nwhen issues arose.   \n \nFailures and misunderstandings were observed (by younger and older Liberians) to \nhave occurred on the Ghanaian side too, but were generally seen as a secondary \ncomponent of current tensions.  Some Ghanaians were accused of insensitivity, \nreminding the Liberians about what they \u201ehad done in the past\u201f (referring to atrocities \ncommitted during the war), sometimes merely as a (tasteless) joke.  One Liberian man \ndescribed an incident when he was getting off a bus one day and a man heard his \naccent and started insulting him about Liberians eating government money and being \nstupid people.  Others on the bus stopped the Ghanaian when he began to physically \nattack the man.  In some cases the antagonism is related to Liberians being cheated by \nGhanaians: a number of stories of Ghanaians impersonating Liberians in order to \naccess US resettlement programmes were reported. Others put the breakdown of \nLiberian-Ghanaian relationships down to mutual misunderstandings.  \n \nAlthough Liberians did not often specifically identify livelihoods as a cause of \ntension, on closer inspection this appears to be a highly significant sub-theme, \nassociated with both direct competition for jobs and indirect competition for \nlivelihoods through access to land and to migration opportunities to the US.  \nWhatever the cause of dispute, the impact seems to be to encourage a tendency, \nespecially among youth, to stay close to the camp and in some cases to avoid \ninteraction with Ghanaians altogether.   \n \nGhanaian perspectives of Liberia camp refugees \nThe camp Commandant, a Ghanaian, observed: \u201fbecause of the trauma they\u201fve been \nthrough it is better to be humble and patient and reach out to their needs\u201f, but \nGhanaian attitudes on and off the camp are often less understanding.  The notion that \nthe refugees may steal Ghanaians wives or husbands (NGO staff interview; focus \ngroup with older professionals, Kumasi) and a spate of armed robberies on the Cape \nCoast road which reportedly forced the Ghanaian army to move in to secure the road \nare widely cited by Ghanaians as the cause of recent concerns.  There is also a \nwidespread view among Ghanaians that Liberian refugees are well off by comparison \nwith many Ghanaians in the neighbouring area (perhaps exacerbated by the fact that \nGomoa district is one of the poorest in Ghana).  Many Ghanaians observe the visible \nevidence of remittance wealth.  A cursory visit to the camp can reinforce such \nperceptions, since people dress well (the youth mostly in western dress), often pay \n 14 \ngreat attention to keeping their clothes well pressed, and there are many \ncommunication centres, bars, nightclubs etc.  \n \n A male Ghanaian NGO worker at the camp who had experience of other camps in \nGhana argued that the problems at Buduburam were partly a result of the location of \nthe camp so close to Accra, and the population which includes many professionals.  \nReferring to the camp in Western region, where there are reportedly excellent \nGhana\/Liberia relations, because the Liberians go out and earn a living as fishermen, \nfarmers and masons, he suggested people at Buduburam are \u201ehiding their profession\u201f \nand expecting the UNHCR to look after them (Consultative Group meeting). \nHowever, this latter point was disputed by other NGO staff: one drew comparisons \nwith his experience of Sierra Leone where Liberians were given jobs in the early 90s \nand soon integrated.    \n \nNegative views of camp refugees among Ghanaians are particularly focused on young \nLiberians Ghanaians observe the strong Libero-American youth identity, perceived \n\u201ebig dressing\u201f, violence and lack of respect for elders in Liberian youth culture: \n\u201eLiberian youth are very violent and feel free to speak their mind unlike Ghanaians\u201f \n(female Ghanaian NGO worker).  We were told by another young Ghanaian NGO \nworker, \u201eGhanaians give due respect to elders. Liberians talk freely about \nrelationships and sex issues. A 16 year-old girl doesn\u201ft mind telling you; a Ghanaian \ngirl would find it difficult\u2026 and Liberians are not too eager to go to school unlike the \nGhanaians\u2026. Though I haven\u201ft done research\u2026.they are not hardworking like \nGhanaian youths\u2026 about a third are creative, most won\u201ft [work] even when you give \nthem the money to start something, they prefer dressing big\u2026 maybe because of the \nAmerican orientation, the easy life.  \u2026   Most have relatives outside [overseas]\u2026 they \ncan use it [remittances] for fees, but it\u201fs for mobile phones and jeans\u2026  they can\u201ft \npay the child\u201fs [school] fees but they come with a 3 million [cedi] mobile phone\u201f. \nShe was also keen to make the point that there were very positive elements in the \ncommunity, a view supported by other non-Liberian NGO staff. One noted the way \nmany Liberian women (especially single women) would look after Liberian children \nwhich were not their own: \u201eshe will sacrifice for the child if she can\u201ft eat herself\u201f.  \nThey observed that when they interviewed these children separately to ensure \nexploitation was not occurring, all the children made it clear that they were happy \nwith their foster mothers.  In focus group discussions, Ghanaians who had had \npersonal contact with Liberians also pointed to positive attributes of adaptability and \nenterprise, but the view that young Liberians are violent, arrogant and need to be \neducated on the courtesies and cultural values of the host population was raised in all \nsix focus groups: \u201cOld folks are sociable and amenable but the younger generally are \nrecalcitrant\u201d (Kasoa market focus group).   \n \nMany Ghanaians have limited awareness of the deep psychological traumas induced \nby war, the aftermath of war, refugee life and the difficulties of obtaining employment \ncommensurate with that the refugees might have had in Liberia prior to the war  \nAbout one-quarter of youth on the camp are reportedly ex-combatants.  Our Ghanaian \ncollaborators who came to the camp with (at that stage unspoken) reservations based \non negative local media reports soon observed and empathised with the enormous \nfrustrations and difficulties that people there face: not least the long-term traumas of \nwar.   \n \n 15 \nLanguage, identity and livelihood \nLanguage and identity issues are connected with access to livelihoods in direct and \nmore complex ways.  One of the most important distinctions between older people \n(especially older women) in the camp and most young people is the difference in their \nability to speak Ghanaian languages.  Whereas older women, in particular, often \nspeak fluent Twi (the Akan language widely spoken across Ghana), which facilitates \ntheir trading activities, in particular, very few young people seem to have a good \nknowledge of Twi or other local Ghanaian languages which could enable them to \ninteract with Ghanaians and might help them access jobs in the informal sector \noutside the camp.  Indeed, many (possibly most) youth who have been in the camp for \nsome years have hardly any knowledge of Twi.  This may well have important \nimplications for the quality of interaction with Ghanaians.  \n \nSome of the older \u201eyouths\u201f seem to recognise that this language problem prevents \nthem making links to the Ghanaian community. Two such respondents observed that \nthose attending Ghanaian schools integrate more easily because they learn Twi and \nthe language barrier is thus overcome.  However, some of the Ghanaian schools are \nreportedly expensive or difficult to access and there is no Twi language teaching in \nthe camp, other than in the Senior Secondary School, which relatively few young \npeople attend. \n \nEven where language is not a barrier to understanding (since many Ghanaians speak \nEnglish), Liberians are easily identified by Ghanaians when they speak English \nbecause of their distinctive accent: \u201eyou go to a ministry and open your mouth as a \nLiberian\u2026 because a single Liberian committed a crime, the perception is\u2026That\u201fs \nwhy Liberians don\u201ft go from here\u201f [i.e. don\u201ft leave the camp].  Some youths said \nGhanaians would shout after them, because they heard them speak. Twi might offer a \nbetter language of communication from this perspective.  \n \nWhen we discussed the language issue with Ghanaians outside the camp who are \ninvolved in camp support it was suggested that \u201eLiberians don\u201ft easily learn other \nlanguages; even those here 10-14 years still don\u201ft speak Twi\u201f (NGO staff member).    \nOne of our research workers suggested that there seems to be more actual resistance \namong youth than among older Liberians to learning Twi and that this is one of the \nfactors that confines young people to the camp, since it is difficult for them to \ncommunicate with outsiders.   \n \nThe advantage of knowing Twi was acknowledged by a few young people.  One 19-\nyear old girl explained how her knowledge of Twi (gained in the Ivory Coast) had \nenabled her to make friends with a group of Ghanaians who help her with free fish \nand pepper when they meet her in the market.  None of the other girls in the focus \ngroup in which we met her had any Ghanaian friends who helped them: none spoke \nmore than a few words of Twi. \n \nThe psychological element in this apparent resistance to learning Twi has to be \nacknowledged. It may be a reflection of young refugees\u201f determination to retain a \nLiberian identity (or at least to keep it until an alternative black-American identity can \nbe achieved). Dick (2002b: 32) concluded that Liberians prefer Buduburam as an \nenclave, rather than integration in Ghana: we found this to hold most strongly among \nyouth.  Indeed, resistance to learning Twi among youth may reflect more the outcome \n 16 \nof their decision-making process, rather than a factor affecting their integration: a \nrefusal to accept that they will be staying long in Ghana, and a recognition that they \nexpect to be going on to the US (as so many wish to do) or returning home.  In the US \na knowledge of Twi will be of no value, as one young man pointed out.    Another \nyoung man argued, however, that the language barrier was the biggest impediment \nstopping youths getting involved in local society and work, and felt that not only Twi \nand Ga languages, but also Ghanaian cultural mores should be taught in the camp \nschools.   \n \nBy contrast with youth, older Liberian women, in particular, have not only learned to \nspeak Twi, but also dress in Ghanaian style: this enables them to intermingle with \nGhanaians far more easily and make friends with Ghanaians, to the extent that some \nsaid they actually now feel more Ghanaian than Liberian.  They thus negotiate \nmultiple national identities as a route to survival. Older men, by contrast with older \nwomen, have less contact with Ghanaians, presumably because they have not usually \nbeen involved in trading, but still seem to have more knowledge of Twi than youth.   \n \nCertainly, the extent to which young people identify with Liberian or Ghanaian \nnationality is partly related to particular good or bad encounters with local Ghanaians, \nas the following focus group exchange between young women shows. Even so, note \nthe strong Liberian sentiments exhibited here, despite the presence of three Ghanaian \nresearchers: \n\u201cI am Liberian \u2013 I don\u201ft have any Ghanaian friends.\u201d \n\u201cI feel both, because I have some Ghanaian friends in Tema.\u201d \n\u201cI feel both.  My mother is Ghanaian and my father Liberian.  I am attending a \nGhanaian school in Kasoa.\u201d \n\u201cI feel Liberian, because in Liberia I went through the struggle\u201d.  [She goes on to \nrecount an incident of being cheated by two Ghanaian market traders]. \n \nThe accent issue, which is still being debated among refugees, was noted by earlier \nresearchers (Dick 2002a). The solution so far as local trading is concerned seems to \nbe to speak Twi, not English, but this seems to represent such a significant step \ntowards becoming Ghanaian that it is resisted by the majority of youth who mostly \npin their hopes on a future elsewhere, beyond Africa.  The lure of the US for youth \ncan not be overemphasised: \u201enowadays, if they had money for nursery to PhD \neducation in Ghana or go to the US, they\u201fd go to the US\u2026 a boy told me, I prefer \nbeing in America on the dung pile than in Africa\u201f (teacher, Consultative Group April \n2005) \n\u201egenerally on the camp you feel connected to the USA, you have a friend or relative \nthere,\u201f (25-year old male student in focus group). The others in the group agreed: \n\u201cMost people plan to go to the USA\u201d, \u201cUSA is the land of opportunity first.\u201d   \nIf a new identity has to be constructed, it is clear that an American identity will be \nvastly preferable to most young Liberians (particularly young men)  than a Ghanaian \none.  In focus groups generally all the young men expressed a desire to go to the US, \nrather than back to Liberia, whereas in girls\u201f groups generally one or two preferred \nLiberia. Among older men and women, there was a stronger emphasis on returning to \nLiberia, but only in the [distant] future when conditions have fully stabilised and they \nhave accumulated resources to take home.  It was widely agreed among all age groups \nthat at least 80% of camp inhabitants overseas contacts (through telephone, email and \n 17 \nthe Red Cross) are with the US and Europe; at most only 20% are with Liberia: \n\u201ccalling Liberia gives us courage and call to USA\/Europe gives us our meal\u201d (focus \ngroup with young men).  \n \nConclusion \nProtracted refugee situations like that at Buduburam often raise particular difficulties \nfor hosts, refugees and humanitarian donors.  The cost and logistics of basic service \nprovision are enormous and refugees commonly have to rely on developing their own \nlivelihood opportunities in order to survive. However, this often complicates relations \nwith host communities, exacerbating tensions.  This is clearly exemplified by the \nsituation at Buduburam.  Most Liberian refugees here face major hurdles in building \nand maintaining a livelihood, not least because of the difficulties of relations between \nthe camp and the host population in recent years.  In Ghana, as in much of Africa, \naccess to jobs is far more closely linked to social networks than to skills or \nqualifications (Chant and Jones 2005).  Despite the enormous emphasis refugees in \nthe camp gave to earning a livelihood, throughout our discussions of refugee well-\nbeing (expressed not just in terms of physical well-being but also in terms of self-\nrespect and mental health and knock-on implications for social relations within the \nrefugee community), many seemed unable or unwilling to build the social networks to \nthe host population that might allow them to access regular employment.  These \nproblems are exacerbated by other factors, including the massive size of the camp \npopulation, the deep poverty of the Gomoa district where the camp is situated, and the \nurban character of most of the refugee population which means that the labour made \navailable by the camp is incompatible with local (agricultural) labour needs.   In some \ncases it seems that the frustrations associated with failure to access formal \nemployment commensurate with their skills has encouraged a move into innovative \nbut illegal livelihood strategies. \n \nWithin the refugee community distinctions in livelihood strategies and the extent to \nwhich these involve interaction with the host community are evident, varying in \nparticular according to access to material resources, age, gender and length of time at \nthe camp.  Access to material resources is principally a function of access to overseas \ncontacts and associated remittances. However, there is concern among both refugee \nand host populations regarding the extent to which remittances are used to build \nlegitimate livelihoods and the extent to which they are simply squandered on \nconspicuous consumption, thus exacerbating antagonisms with the host community.  \nDifferences in host relations and associated livelihood impacts are also evident \nbetween refugee age groups.  For older people in the camp, relations to the host \npopulation are often crucial to getting by: many older women, in particular, forge \nhybrid identities through their adoption of Ghanaian dress styles and ability to speak \nTwi.  This enables those with adequate mental and physical strength to scrape \ntogether a living, usually through trade.  By contrast our research suggests that many \nyounger people in the camp, while equally desperate to find a livelihood, are unable to \nmake the necessary social connections to the host population to obtain regular \nemployment.  On the face of it, this seems partially because they do not speak Twi, \nbut underlying this may be unacknowledged reluctance to adopt a Ghanaian identity \n(principally through learning Twi) that would compromise their dreams, which focus \non a new life in America.  However, since 9\/11 those dreams have become \nincreasingly unrealisable, since US immigration restrictions have tightened \nsubstantially.  Those who have arrived at the camp since 2000 face a particularly \n 18 \ndifficult situation given the saturated local markets, dwindling generosity of local \nGhanaians and lack of UNHCR support.   \n \nThis paper has emphasised the strong linkages between social resilience, social \nnetworks and livelihoods. The complexities of resolving livelihood needs while \nmaintaining good refugee-host relations are clearly enormous.  Our research \nsuggested that UNHCR will need to examine ways of improving relations with the \nGhanaian host community, including examining the potential for a pilot programme \nof Twi classes in the camp. We found that Dick\u201fs assessment (2002b: 32) that many \nLiberians prefer Buduburam as an enclave, rather than integration in Ghana, applies \nparticularly strongly to youth.  Failure to understand Twi has arguably inhibited both \ntheir livelihood opportunities and general relations with Ghanaians. Although Twi \nlanguage classes may be simply too late now to change lives at Buduburam, our \nfindings suggest that local language tuition probably needs to be given much more \nserious consideration in future refugee contexts than has usually been the case.  \nFinally, one recent strategy in refugee work has been to adopt a so-called \ndevelopmental approach whereby needs of refugees and their host communities are \ndealt with together: the aim is that in this way conditions will move from relief to \ndevelopment.  Although evidence from recent efforts at developmental approaches is \nnot entirely positive\n3\n, in contexts like Buduburam, where the host population is very \npoor, this would seem a feasible strategy, but only if accompanied by substantial \nsupport for integration.  A new initiative (supported by JICA) which appears to be \noffering skills training to both refugee and host communities, together with \nsensitisation campaigns in both regarding their mutual obligations\n4\n, appears a \npromising step in this direction.   \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThis study was funded by the Nuffield Foundation.
