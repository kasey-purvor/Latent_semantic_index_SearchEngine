If\nthe likely consequences of future changes of groundwater recharge, resulting from both\nclimate and socio-economic change, are to be assessed, hydrogeologists must increasingly\nwork with researchers from other disciplines, such as socio-economists, agricultural modellers\nand soil scientists.\nKeywords Groundwater recharge, Climate change, Socio-economic aspects, Numerical\nmodelling, Groundwater management\nIntroduction\nThe potential impacts of climate change on water resources have long been recognised,\nalthough there has been comparatively little research relating to groundwater (IPCC 2001).\nThe principle focus of climate change research with regard to groundwater has been on\nquantifying the likely direct impacts of changing precipitation and temperature patterns (e.g.\nYusoff et al. 2002; Loaiciga et al. 2000; Arnell 1998). Such studies have used a range of\nmodelling techniques such as soil water balance models (e.g. Kruger et al. 2001; Arnell\n1998), empirical models (e.g. Chen et al. 2002), conceptual models (e.g. Cooper et al. 1995)\nand more complex distributed models (e.g. Croley and Luukkonen 2003; Kirshen 2002;\nYusoff et al. 2002), but all have derived changes in groundwater recharge assuming\nparameters other than precipitation and temperature remain constant.\n3Studies which have gone further than this, in considering the indirect effects derived from\nclimate change-induced alterations in soil (Feddema and Freire, 2001), landcover (Loukas et\nal. 2002), salt-water intrusion due to rising sea levels (Bobba 2002; Sherif and Singh 1999)\nand changes in water demand (Alderwish and Al-Eryani 1999; Meigh et al. 1999; Chen et al.\n2001) are less common. These studies represent a move away from impact studies (which\nmay be considered to be vertically integrated, in which climate change acts upon an\nenvironmental compartment) towards horizontally integrated studies in which environmental\ncompartments interact with each other . However, they remain an incomplete assessment of\nthe pressures facing groundwater resources associated with the direct and indirect effects of\nfuture climate and socio-economic change.\nCurrent European Commission legislation, such as the Water Framework Directive and\nNitrate Directive in Europe, increasingly recognises that groundwater cannot be considered in\nisolation from the landscape above, the society with which it \u2018interacts\u2019, or from the regional\nhydrological cycle, but needs to be managed holistically. In understanding the likely\nconsequences of possible future (climate and non-climate) changes on groundwater systems\nand the regional hydrological cycle, an important (but not exclusive) component to\nunderstand is the influence that these factors exert on recharge and runoff. This paper\ndescribes an approach towards estimating groundwater recharge which takes into account the\ndirect and indirect contributions of climate change and socio-economic change, and further\nconsiders the uncertainties and potential shortcomings which are pertinent for future recharge\nassessment and groundwater modelling studies.\n4Methodology\nThe \u2018Regional Climate Change Impact and Response Studies in East Anglia and North West\nEngland\u2019 (RegIS) (Holman et al. 2005a In Press) developed a research methodology for\nstakeholder-led, regional climate change impact assessment that explicitly evaluated local and\nregional (sub-national) scale climate change impacts and adaptation options, and cross-\nsectoral interactions between the major \u2018sectors\u2019 driving landscape change (coastal,\nagricultural, water and biodiversity sectors).\nOf the numerous Integrated Assessment frameworks available (e.g. Argent 2004), the\n\u2018Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response\u2019 (DPSIR) approach (European Environment Agency\n1998) was chosen, the components of which were used to define the various stages of the RegIS\nmethodology:\nD: Drivers are the underlying exogenous (to the region) causes of environmental change,\ne.g. climate and socio-economic change, national and international policy. They are\ndescribed by qualitative narratives or storylines.\nP: Pressures are the endogenous (to the region) variables that quantify the drivers, e.g.\ntemperature, precipitation etc. for climate change; and population, subsidies etc. for\nsocio-economic change. These are applied through regional, quantitative scenarios.\nS: States are the variables (indicators) that represent the sensitivity of the system to the\npressure variables, e.g. groundwater resources, river flows, land use areas. Coupled,\nsectoral models simulate indicators of sectoral impacts and cross-sectoral interactions.\nI: Impacts are a measure of whether the State variables have reached a certain value\n(represented by thresholds etc.), which has a negative or positive effect e.g. minimum\n5groundwater levels or river flows, acceptable farm profit etc. These are quantified by\napplying critical thresholds to the outputs from the linked models.\nR: Responses are the planned (societal level) adaptation options that aim to minimise\nnegative impacts (or maximise positive impacts \/ benefits). These are identified with\nstakeholders and evaluated with linked models and expert knowledge.\nThe RegIS methodology is described elsewhere (Holman et al. 2005a In Press) but, in the\ncontext of groundwater recharge, is summarized below:\n1. The modelling context is provided by the climate and socio-economic scenarios;\n2. Relevant spatial and non-spatial data, including data from (1) are extracted from a GIS;\n3. Using data from (2), the coastal and river modelling determines areas not suitable for\nagriculture on the basis of flood frequency estimation;\n4. Output from (3) and urban, upland and woodland areas from (2) exclude areas from which\nthe agricultural modelling can determine the land use distribution of arable and grassland\nsystems;\n5. The land use distribution is based on profitability, arising from costs, prices and subsidies\n(from the socio-economic scenarios) and predicted yields for each crop-soil type\ncombination- the latter from a crop-growth model which includes a full soil-water\nbalance;\n6. The output data of hydrologically effective rainfall from (5) provides the input to the\nhydrological modelling, which simulates potential recharge, gross groundwater resources\n(for areas underlain by aquifers) and river flows.\nThe input scenarios\n6Climate change scenarios have been developed on behalf of the United Kingdom Climate\nImpacts Programme (UKCIP), known as the UKCIP98 scenarios (Hulme and Jenkins 1998),\nusing output from the HadCM2 General Circulation Model. A high and a low climate\nchange scenario for the period 2040-2069, termed the 2050s Low and 2050s High scenarios,\nwere used to characterise the lower and upper ends of the expected temperature changes.\nAs the future world will change even without climate change, regional socio-economic\nscenarios were derived (Shackley and Deanwood 2003). In addition to storylines, these\nscenarios contain a range of quantified spatial (Figure 1) and non-spatial model parameters.\nInternally consistent futures were modelled, in which the assumptions which underpin the\ndifferent scenarios (socio-economic, CO2 emission and climate change) are consistent:\n\uf0b7 Regional Enterprise (equivalent to the IPCC A2 emissions scenario) socio-economic\nscenario linked with the 2050s High climate change scenario. This future provides an\nextreme case of a society that does not respond to the threat of climate change over the\nnext 50 years i.e. an 'adverse case\u2019 analysis;\n\uf0b7 Global Sustainability (equivalent to IPCC B1 emissions scenario) socio-economic\nscenario linked with the 2050s Low climate change scenario, represents a \u2018better case\u2019\nanalysis with respect to pressures upon environmental systems and associated impacts.\nIn addition, the linked models were run for the two climate change scenarios with baseline\n(current) socio-economics scenario to assess the relative importance of climate change and\nsocio-economic change.\nImpact modelling\n7Regional heterogeneity is accommodated by applying a spatial modelling approach to a\ngeographic grid of 5 km x 5 km. Although model outputs were aggregated to the 5 km grid,\nthe models were applied to smaller geographical units within each grid cell, such as\nfloodplains, soil types, cultivatable land etc. A range of validated impact models were linked\nwithin the RegIS methodology (Holman et al. 2005a In Press), which are briefly described\nbelow.\nCoastal and river flooding\nThe coastal and river flooding model (Nicholls and Wilson 2001) assessed the impact of\nincreased flooding on the agricultural sector. The effect of sea level rise on tide-surge heights\nwas estimated by adding the UKCIP98 sea level rise projections to the water levels of specific\nreturn periods as no data are provided for other climatic factors such as storminess.\nFloodplains where the future standard of defence (i.e. risk of flooding) will be less than 1 in\n10 years were assumed to be unsuitable for arable farming, while those with a future standard\nof less than 1 in 1 year were assumed to be unsuitable for both arable and pastoral farming.\nAgricultural land use modelling\nThe agricultural land use modelling integrates an optimisation approach to farm level\ncropping decisions (SFARMOD) with a crop growth model (ACCESS). The approach and\nvalidation are described in Rounsevell et al. (2003). Farms within SFARMOD optimise their\nlong term farm cropping plan on each soil type within each grid cell by maximising farm\nprofit, in response to changes in the profitability\/feasibility of enterprises, soil workability and\nsimulated yields brought about by changes in climate and \/ or socio-economic conditions.\nWater resources modelling\n8The distributed semi-empirical SWANCATCH (Surface WAter Nitrate CATCHment) model\n(Holman et al. 2001) was used to simulate naturalised surface water flows1 in 88\ncatchments\/sub-catchments and gross groundwater resources in 51 water management units.\nSWANCATCH routes the hydrologically effective rainfall (that proportion of the rainfall\nwhich is able to run off or infiltrate the surface) from the land use modelling through each soil\ntype directly to surface water or to a groundwater store2, according to the Hydrology Of Soil\nTypes (HOST) system (Boorman et al, 1995).\nHOST is a conceptual representation of the hydrological processes in the soil zone. All soil\ntypes in the United Kingdom have been grouped into one of 29 hydrological response models\n(or HOST classes), for which calibrated values of Base Flow Index (BFI) and Standard\nPercentage Runoff (SPR) are given. BFI is the long-term average proportion of flow that\ncomes from groundwater stores and SPR is the percentage runoff derived from measurements\nof runoff events, adjusted to standard rainfall and catchment moisture conditions (Boorman et\nal., 1995). The HOST classification is capable of predicting river flows in ungauged\ncatchments throughout the UK (r2 = 0.79, standard error of estimate of 0.089 in the case of\nBase Flow Index).\nThe paucity of data on distributed groundwater recharge or naturalised river flows makes the\nvalidation of such regional studies difficult. SWANCATCH was regionally calibrated against\nlong-term average annual gross groundwater resource estimates for the water management\nunits (r2 = 0.97); and validated by comparison of simulated and observed 95th percentile and\n50th percentile exceedence river flows from nine catchments (r2 = 0.92 and 0.99, respectively).\n1 Flows which have had the abstractions added back in and the discharges removed.\n2 The groundwater store in the model provides baseflow to the river. It may, but does not have to, meet the\ndefinition of an aquifer, of yielding significant quantities of water to wells and springs.\n9Case study results in the context of groundwater recharge impacts\nThe case study described was performed in East Anglia (Fig. 2), the flattest part of the UK,\nwith appreciable areas such as the Fens below sea level. The climate is influenced by its low\nrelief and proximity to the continent, with average annual rainfall of 550 - 750 mm, and\nagriculture is characterised by intensive arable cultivation. The region is largely (with the\nexception of the Fens) underlain by Cretaceous (chalk and greensand) or Pleistocene (crag)\naquifers. As such it is highly dependent on groundwater, which provides much of the public\nwater supply and irrigation needs and supports river flows and internationally important\nwetland areas such as The Broads. The area has a relatively low level of urbanization, with\nthe exception of key centres such as Cambridge and Norwich.\nCoasts\nClimate change may have profound implications for coastal areas and river valleys in East\nAnglia. Without adaptation (or existing allowances for future sea-level rise in flood defence\nguidance), the interaction of sea-level rise, increased river floods and land subsidence (due to\nregional isostatic adjustment and local peat oxidation) could lead to severe flood impacts in\nthe Fens of East Anglia, leading to large-scale abandonment and salinization (Fig. 3). Large\nareas of the river valleys in east Norfolk would also experience regular sea water inundation.\nIt took up to five years for grazing marshes in east Norfolk to fully recover from the 1938\nfloods, so it is probable that a frequency of coastal flooding of even 1 in 10 years would lead\nto major land use change. Unlike the Fens which are underlain by Jurassic clays, the river\nvalleys in east Norfolk overlie the Crag aquifer, a locally important unconsolidated aquifer\n(Holman et al., 1999). Regular inundation by seawater would lead to the probable\nabandonment or relocation of boreholes in, or close to, these river valleys.\n10\nAgriculture\nCropping distribution in East Anglia is relatively insensitive to climate, changing little\nbetween the present climate and the future climate change scenarios (under the baseline socio-\neconomic scenario) apart from areas prone to flooding. However, cropping patterns are very\nsensitive to the socio-economic scenarios (Fig. 4). Spring-sown crops gain over autumn-sown\ncrops in East Anglia, with particular increases in irrigated sugar beets and potatoes. For the\nprices in the socio-economic scenarios, the results suggest that the area of irrigated potatoes\nwould double with resulting increases in groundwater abstraction, despite large increases in\nthe water price.\nSaline intrusion into aquifers\nSaline intrusion into coastal aquifers is considered not to be a major problem, as sea level\nrises should necessitate only minor reductions in so-called safe yield abstraction rates, or the\nmovement of boreholes inland (Arnell et al. 1994). However, land drainage changes in some\nof the coastal marshes in east Norfolk, in response to land abandonment (Fig. 3) or\nagricultural policy change, may induce increased saline intrusion within the Crag aquifer\n(Holman and Hiscock 1998).\nHydrologically Effective Rainfall (HER)\nThe warmer future climate leads to an increase in the length of the growing season, so that the\nregion\u2019s soils return to field capacity later in the autumn and start drying out sooner in the\nspring. This leads to a reduction in the length of the recharge period as shown in Fig. 5. The\noverall effect is to reduce Hydrologically Effective Rainfall, and consequently recharge, in\nmuch of the region, even though annual rainfall increases. Fig. 6 shows the seasonal\ncontribution to the change in average annual HER between the Baseline and 2050s High, with\n11\nthe grid cells ordered by decreasing percentage change of average annual HER. The bulk of\nthe change in annual average HER is caused by a decrease in autumn HER and also winter\nHER due to increased actual evapotranspiration.\nThe socio-economic scenarios affect the average annual HER predictions at the local and\nregional scales as shown in Fig. 7. Locally, increased urbanisation and woodland\nestablishment lead to significant changes in evapotranspiration and HER. The socio-\neconomic scenarios can also cause regional changes in land use, such as an increase in the\ncultivation of spring-sown crops at the expense of autumn-sown crops under the Regional\nEnterprise scenario, which results in a small regional increase in average annual HER.\nFeedback effects\nAs the first attempt to produce an integrated assessment of climate and socio-economic\nchange, the RegIS study was inevitably an incomplete representation of the complex\nmechanisms controlling landscape change. In particular a number of limitations of the study\nare:\n\uf0b7 The degree of actual flooding will be dependent on society\u2019s response to sea level rise\nand storminess, which might take the form of raised sea defences and river levees or\nmore sustainable measures such as managed realignment (an engineering process\ninvolving the physical removal or deliberate breaching of existing flood defences in\norder to re-establish intertidal habitat and enhance natural flood defences);\n\uf0b7 No feedbacks were implemented between abstraction and water resource availability\nor critical thresholds of surface water flows \/ groundwater levels. Although irrigation\nuse was limited by profitability, rotation and cultivation constraints (i.e. potatoes could\nonly be grown on up to 25% of suitable soils because of a 1-in-4 year rotation), the\n12\nactual availability of irrigation water was assumed to be unconstrained. An increase in\nwater price was used to represent the increased costs of on-farm water storage (as\nopposed to direct abstraction), but it is likely that the agricultural sector will face\nincreased water resource constraints (Weatherhead and Knox 1999);\n\uf0b7 Similar limitations apply to the scenarios of urban development, which assumed that\nthe increased population and housing were unconstrained by water availability;\n\uf0b7 There was no agricultural supply-demand price feedback on the agricultural crops, as\nit was assumed that the regional supply did not affect the market commodity price.\n\uf0b7 Internally consistent futures in which the assumptions in the different scenarios (socio-\neconomic, CO2 emission and climate change) are consistent, implicitly assumes that\nregional and global societies are developing along similar pathways.\nDiscussion\nAlthough assessments of potential groundwater recharge in East Anglia were derived\n(Holman et al. 2005b In Press), they are not presented here. Instead, the presentation of\nresults concluded with the derivation of Hydrologically Effective Rainfall, that portion of\nrainfall which is available for recharge or runoff depending on landscape conditions. This is\nbecause the most significant issues in assessing the impacts of future (climate and socio-\neconomic) change on groundwater recharge are associated with:\n1. uncertainties in calculating HER; and\n2. shortcomings in the implicit assumptions for partitioning HER into recharge and\nrunoff.\nSources of uncertainty\nSocio-economic input scenarios\n13\nIntegrated assessment allows the assessment of the impacts of future change on the water\nenvironment. In particular, the successful integration of socio-economic scenarios into the\nmodelling of spatial land use enables the indirect impacts, resulting from changing patterns of\nurbanization, flooding and cropping, to be assessed and quantified.\nThe direct impacts of the climate scenarios on hydrologically effective rainfall are generally\nregionally more important than those of the socio-economic scenarios. However, the socio-\neconomic scenarios do cause regional changes in HER and locally their impacts can be highly\nsignificant, especially where there are major land use changes. Because simulated land use\ndistribution is derived from a model in which farmers are maximising farm profit, the results\nare sensitive to the elements of the socio-economic scenarios which affect the profitability of\nindividual crops either directly (e.g subsidies, prices etc.) or indirectly (labour, input prices\netc.). Similarly the changing patterns of urbanization are dependent upon the scenarios of\npopulation change, housing density and household size.\nClearly in both cases, all of these parameters are uncertain, even though they are developed\nwithin the constraints of the future defined by the scenario. Although scenario development\nis an imperfect \u2018science\u2019 (Parson and Granger Morgan 2000), few alternatives exist in\nexploring the consequences of unknown futures. Scenarios are therefore an integral part of\nclimate impact assessment (Leemans 1999) and will continue to be widely used by the\nscientific and policy-making communities.\nScenario (adaptation) feedbacks\nOne of the principal limitations of scenarios results from feedbacks across scale boundaries,\nsuch as the effect of changing land use areas on agricultural prices: increasing the local\n14\nsupply of an individual crop may result in lower prices dependent upon market demand and\nsupply. These types of dynamic cross-scale processes cannot be dealt with in a satisfactory\nway using a scenario approach, and alternative approaches (e.g. Cash and Moser 2000) that\ncan operate across scales such as hierarchy theory or nested models that operate at different\nscales may be needed (Easterling 1997). Studies have attempted to model the price change\nfeedback that results from agricultural land use change using a model of macro (global)\neconomics that simulates all regions of the world (e.g. Parry et al. 1996; Conway et al. 1996).\nHydrogeologists are used to high-resolution, site-scale groundwater models being nested\nwithin basin-scale models, in order for simulated boundary conditions or fluxes to be applied\nto the \u2018inner\u2019 model (e.g. Keating et al. 2003). However, there is a need for groundwater\nmodels to be coupled to nested land use \/ landscape models if the implications of these\nfeedback mechanisms on land use and recharge are to be fully incorporated.\nMitigation (response) scenarios\nMitigation scenarios can also introduce uncertainty into the assessment of the indirect impacts\nof climate change on groundwater. For example, conversion of arable land to energy or\nbiomass crop production (e.g Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice for willow- Salix spp.\nand poplar- Populus spp.) is a potential means of carbon sequestration and fossil fuel\nreplacement. However, while Kort et al. (1998) stress the advantages associated with\nimproved soil organic matter, soil structure and water infiltration, Stephens et al. (2001)\nhighlight the significantly increased soil water use by these crops, which would lead to\nreduced recharge.\nTemporal and spatial scale\n15\nFor groundwater recharge estimation, changes in precipitation amount and intensity (insofar\nas it affects runoff and infiltration) are much more important than changes in temperature.\nMany studies suggest that precipitation intensities will tend to increase, particularly for larger\nevents (e.g. Voss et al. 2002; Jones and Reed 2001). However, although the issues of, and\napproaches to, downscaling the results from Global Climate Models (GCMs) or Regional\nClimate Models to a scale relevant for hydrological impact studies are well known, and are\nreviewed by Prudhomme et al. (2002), there is no single appropriate downscaling approach.\nA spatial modelling scale is also needed that balances the data, model run-time and credibility\nconstraints that result from an integrated, multi-sectoral modelling approach against the\nspatial resolution desired by hydrogeologists (of the order 0.5 x 0.5 km or 1km x 1km).\nClimate change scenarios are typically at a coarser resolution- the 10km x 10km resolution of\nthe UKCIP98 scenarios was derived using \u2018unintelligent downscaling\u2019 (Hulme and Jenkins\n1998) which added no new meteorological insight beyond the GCM-based changes, and\nhence implicitly limits the credibility of much further downscaling. The newer UKCIP02\nclimate scenarios were generated using a nested higher resolution Regional Climate Model\nwithin the GCM, but this has only allowed 5 km x 5km output. There are similar, but greater,\nissues of credibility with downscaling the spatial components of the socio-economic\nscenarios.\nRecharge models of any spatial scale can, in theory, be embedded within such an integrated\nassessment. However, there are fundamental spatial limits to the resolution of climate and\nsocio-economic scenarios, and to other spatial models e.g. land use, which means that spatial\ninput parameters to a recharge model are not resolved at that detailed scale.\n16\nShortcomings\nThe analysis presented in this paper has assumed, in common with almost all assessments of\nclimate change impacts, that the physical properties of the landscape (other than those\nchanged fundamentally by urbanization) remain constant. Typically, available soil property\ndata (such as bulk density, water retention and hydraulic conductivity), which have been\ncollected over a number of past years by soil survey organizations, are used to parameterise\nthe simulation of infiltration \/ runoff \/ soil water availability. Once calibrated, the model is\nthen used predictively, with the soil properties unchanged. However, there is mounting\nevidence that the condition of temperate soils are changing at a range of temporal scales\n(Rounsevell et al. 1999), and this has concomitant implications for assessments of future\ngroundwater recharge.\nShort term changes\nA range of cropping and stock management systems in intensive agriculture have the potential\nto significantly modify soil hydrology (e.g. Chambers and Garwood 2000), by impacting\nupon soil structural conditions. These impacts mainly result from the need for machinery or\nlivestock to access land at times when soils are at, or approaching, their wettest season. A\nstudy in four contrasting UK catchments in 2000 showed widespread soil structural\ndegradation, for which an initial assessment of the resulting hydrological impacts suggested\nsignificantly increased runoff (Holman et al. 2003), and consequent decreases in recharge.\nClimate change will cause a change in the timing of the return of soils to their field capacity\nstate. If it occurs later in the autumn, as in Figs. 5 and 6, an increase in the length of the\nautumn cultivation period may reduce the likelihood of needing machinery to access land\nwhen it is wet. However, the scope provided by climate change to introduce new crops (e.g\n17\nsunflowers- Harrison and Butterfield 1996; grain maize- Carter et al. 1992; forage maize-\nDavies et al. 1996) and to alter current rotations (e.g. Bowman et al. 2000) means that the\npotential to impact on soil conditions should not be discounted. Land use models which\nincorporate workability restrictions due to soil wetness conditions should be used to assess the\nimplications of the introduction of novel crops or altered rotations on groundwater recharge.\nMedium term changes\nThe potential for intensive agricultural systems to decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC)\nconcentrations is widely recognised (Reeves 1997). Studies in different soils and climatic\nconditions (e.g. Cannell and Hawes 1994, Hernanz et al. 2002), have demonstrated a positive\ncorrelation between SOC and structural stability of soil aggregates, enabling them to\nwithstand wetting and mechanical forces due to tillage implements and vehicular traffic\n(Tisdall and Oades 1982). Loveland and Webb (2003) state that although there is little\nquantitative data to substantiate it, it seems widely believed that a major 'critical' SOC\nthreshold is at 2% SOC (ca. 3.4% soil organic matter), below which a potentially serious\ndecline in soil quality will occur. Future or continuing decreases in SOC (e.g. as described by\nWebb et al., 2001) associated with changes in cropping or rotations (e.g. Bowman et al. 2000)\nor increases in soil erosion (e.g. Pruski and Nearing 2002) may therefore be of concern for\ninfiltration and recharge studies.\nCrop changes can introduce changes to carbon cycling. For example, rotations containing\nsunflowers led to lower SOC content in the upper topsoil, attributed to increased tillage and\nthe lower amounts of residue incorporation (Bowman et al. 2000). Even if cropping patterns\nand rotations remain constant, the effects of different tillage practices, such as conventional\ntillage, reduced tillage and no-till systems on surface sealing, aggregate stability (Tebrugge\n18\nand During 1999) and water movement (e.g. O\u2019Leary 1996; Ankeny et al. 1995) are\nbecoming increasingly understood\nLonger term changes\nPeat soils are important for regulating catchment hydrological response (e.g Bragg 2002), but\nare vulnerable to extraction, burning or drainage. Once drained, agricultural peat soils are\nprone to wastage of 1\u20132 cm a-1 (Cannell et al. 1999) due to consolidation and oxidation.\nWhile peat soils tend not to overlie important aquifers or are located in an aquifer\u2019s discharge\nzone, the environmental function of groundwater within them is important, in regulating the\nflow of water in downstream rivers. If an integrated surface water \u2013 groundwater model in a\ncatchment with significant peat soils is calibrated and then applied predictively without\nconsidering potential changes in the peat, it may overestimate future baseflow contribution.\nWhen is an Integrated view merited?\nThe RegIS Integrated Assessment methodology has (partially) demonstrated how an holistic\nview of the consequences of future change on groundwater recharge, and therefore\ngroundwater resources, can be assessed. However, to fully implement such an approach is a\ncomplex and resource-intensive exercise. It is relevant therefore to consider when simpler\n(e.g. climate-only) assessment approaches are appropriate.\nThe significance of a change in hydrologically effective rainfall or recharge needs to be\nassessed within the context of exploitable groundwater resources (Quinn et al. 2004), and the\nimpacts of any change for the aquatic environment (Sophocleous 2002; Baron et al. 2002;\nDanielopol et al., 2003) or for future groundwater quality (e.g. Gomez et al 2003). In light of\n19\nthe result that climate change has the larger impact on HER regionally, but that socio-\neconomic-induced changes can have a dramatic impact locally, it is suggested to use:\n\uf0b7 Simple direct estimations of climate-change-only impacts on groundwater (assuming\ncurrent land use distributions) in areas where:\no current groundwater resource management is sustainable, and there are significant\nunutilized resources;\no there are few groundwater-sensitive wetlands or aquatic systems;\no such estimations demonstrate only minor impacts on groundwater recharge and\nsustainable water resource management, which is supported by sensitivity\nanalysis.\n\uf0b7 Partially integrated assessments in areas where:\no current groundwater resource management is sustainable, but there is little\nunutilized resources;\no agricultural systems are prone to significant change, either short-term due to\nchanges in subsidies or environmental legislation; or longer term due to climate\nchange-induced changes in crop suitability;\no spatial development planning pressures suggest significant possible increases in\nurban development;\no land use and groundwater recharge quality may be sensitive to future coastal\ndefence policy.\n\uf0b7 Fully integrated assessments in areas where:\no current groundwater resource management is unsustainable; or\n20\no there are important groundwater-sensitive wetlands or aquatic systems and current\ngroundwater resource management is sustainable but there is little unutilized\nresources.\nDue to a lack of data or knowledge as to the magnitude and extent of such future changes, it\nmay not be possible to include all of these effects quantitatively in groundwater recharge\nmodelling. However, to ensure that groundwater studies are robust to these sources of\nuncertainty, it is important that:\n\uf0b7 hydrogeologists should increasingly work in interdisciplinary teams to improve the\nrepresentation or appreciation of these processes within groundwater modelling;\n\uf0b7 the potential effects on recharge and groundwater systems are assessed through\ncomprehensive sensitivity analyses.\nConclusions\nThis paper has described an integrated approach to assessing the direct and indirect impacts of\nclimate and socio-economic change on groundwater recharge, which has been applied in a\ncase study in East Anglia, UK. Many factors will affect groundwater recharge including\nchanged precipitation and temperature regimes, coastal flooding, urbanization and surface\nsealing, woodland creation, cropping and rotation changes. The direct impacts of the climate\nscenarios are generally regionally more important than those of the socio-economic scenarios.\nHowever, the socio-economic scenarios do cause regional changes and locally, the impacts of\nthe socio-economic scenarios can be highly significant, especially where they lead to major\nland use changes.\n21\nThe importance of socio-economic scenarios in exploring the consequences of unknown\nfutures has been highlighted. However, despite the many uncertainties involved in the use of\nscenarios, to solely focus on the direct impacts of climate change (arising from temperature\nand precipitation changes) is to neglect the potentially important role of societal values and\neconomic processes in shaping the landscape above aquifers. There are also changes\noccurring to soil properties over a range of time scales, so that the soils of the future may not\nhave the same infiltration properties as given in current datasets. These all have implications\nfor the certainty, robustness and confidence of future recharge estimates.\nIf the likely consequences on groundwater systems of future change, resulting from both\nclimate and socio-economic change, are to be assessed, it is advocated that hydrogeologists\nmust increasingly work with researchers from other disciplines, such as socio-economists,\nagricultural modellers and soil scientists.\nReferences\nAlderwish A, Al-Eryani M (1999) An approach for assessing the vulnerability of the water\nresources of Yemen to climate change.
