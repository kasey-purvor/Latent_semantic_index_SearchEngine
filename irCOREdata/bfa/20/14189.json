This is reflected in the considerable research literature on issues such as the\nfactors that contribute to effective clinical decision-making, and how it can be\nimproved and evaluated (see literature reviews by Taylor [2000] and Simpson and\nCourtney [2002]). Emphasis in this context has been placed on the use of CAL mate-\nrials for which there are many of the usual reported advantages (learning flexibility,\nimmediate feedback, active student participation, stimulation of motivation, etc.),\nand, in the particular case of medicine, the ability to practise making potentially life-\ncritical decisions for patients in a safe environment (Hooper & Toye, 1975; Barker,\n1989; Whiting, 1989; Aitken et al., 1997; Brain et al., 1999).\n*Corresponding author.

Email: b.ip@swan.ac.uk\n68 B. Ip et al.\nCAL materials in medicine range from relatively simple electronic textbooks to\nmultimedia applications using text, still images, film, and sound. inPractice, a\ncustom-developed CAL package funded by The Meningitis Trust and developed\nat the School of Health Science, University of Wales Swansea, is an example of\nthe latter. It has been in development since 2001, and incorporates two meningi-\ntis-related scenarios that are regularly used by nursing students to complement\ntheir traditional training. The design, construction, and information for the\nscenarios were achieved with the help of experienced clinicians, nursing lecturers,\nand others with a relevant background. The principal aim of the package is to\npromote effective decision-making with respect to meningitis by placing student\nnurses in a simulated but highly realistic environment. This paper outlines the\ndevelopment of inPractice, and some of the lessons learnt since the project\nbegan.\nBackground\nThere are two principal bodies of research work associated with clinical decision-\nmaking. One tends towards a theoretical approach to analysing the cognitive steps\nassociated with how and why a decision is made. The other leans towards evaluat-\ning the quality of decisions made (Taylor, 2000; Denig et al., 2002; Dowding &\nThompson, 2003). In developing a CAL package that would help to promote\neffective decision-making and problem-solving skills in nursing education, consid-\neration was given to both these approaches, but particularly the former during the\ndesign stage.\nDecision-making strategies and evaluation\nTennyson et al. (1987) draw a distinction between three main categories of thinking\nstrategy\u2014recall, problem-solving, and creativity. These range from low-order, auto-\nmatic recall of existing knowledge to a more complex higher-order creation of knowl-\nedge. Similarly, Bonk and Smith (1998) and Girot (2000) outline the importance of\ndeveloping critical thinking (incorporating higher-order and decision-making skills)\nand problem-solving skills to enhance logical reasoning abilities and to promote effec-\ntive decision-making in nursing. In an extensive review of the literature concerning\nhow individuals make decisions in a nursing environment, Taylor (2000) suggests\nthat the process of clinical decision-making involves three key stages: a decision with\nrespect to which observations should be made about a patient in a given situation;\nderivation of meaning from the observed data; and selection of a course of action to\nbe taken for the optimal benefit of the patient. Likewise, Schacter et al. (1999)\ncomment on how good learners and good problem-solvers spend a considerable\namount of time digesting a problem and associated information before breaking it\ndown. Indeed, it is generally acknowledged that the ability to be consistent and effec-\ntive in decision-making and problem-solving involves an ability to digest information,\nand to make a detailed breakdown of the problem at hand, before coming to an\nA practical nursing package for clinical decisions 69\ninformed logical decision on the best course of action. Furthermore, evidence from\nstudies examining the use of problem-based learning initiatives points to numerous\nadvantages including enhanced teamwork, a greater sense of learning enjoyment, and\na better understanding of the subject (Biley & Smith, 1998; Antepohl & Herzig, 1999;\nChang, 2001). Consequently, it is plain that a CAL package aimed at improving\ndecision-making and problem-solving skills needs to do more than simply prescribe\ninformation. Students should be required to use their subject knowledge to make\neffective decisions during a given problem-based scenario, and this is, of course, vital\nin a nursing environment.\nAs regards evaluation of the decisions made, there has been a considerable\namount of research relating to various analytical methods. These include decision\ntrees, Bayes\u2019 Theorem, Utility Theory, Brunswik\u2019s Lens model, and inter-judge\ncomparisons (Lamond & Farnell, 1998; Taylor, 2000; Denig et al., 2002; Dowding\n& Thompson, 2003). Such approaches have attracted some criticism given the fact\nthat nursing decisions cannot be easily quantified and evaluated since they rarely\ninvolve straightforward either\/or choices (Taylor, 2000), but it is clear that evalua-\ntion techniques need to be adopted in order to provide some indication as to the\neffectiveness of training (Berner, 1999, p. 132). It was nevertheless thought that the\napplication of techniques such as these would be best suited for a post hoc assess-\nment of whether the use of inPractice had improved decision-making and problem-\nsolving skills (see later).\nThe design team had to examine how all the aforementioned factors could be\ntranslated into an appropriate CAL package. Crucially, in order effectively to\ncomplement factual material given in lectures, the content would allow students\nto study the procedural aspects of meningitis diagnosis and treatment, such as\nhow the illness is detected, various treatment options and the types of decision\nthat would have to be made by those involved. The program would be used as a\nfacilitator for existing lectures at the School, and as a tool with which to prescribe\nthe necessary information and to manage and monitor student learning outside\nthe classroom environment. To achieve this, different general CAL and problem-\nbased learning design principles were considered. As outlined by Tennyson et al.\n(1987), there are three main design considerations for a package of the inPractice\ntype: (1) to provide the necessary (basic) knowledge and concepts of the subject;\n(2) to present a problem scenario where students\u2019 proposed solutions are evalu-\nated before the next iteration is presented; and (3) to provide an appropriate\nlearning environment and the promotion of group work where possible. Similar\nguidelines can be found in Tennyson (1988), Barker (1989), Rendas et al. (1999),\nand Maudsley and Strivens (2000). Berner (1999) and Grabinger et al. (1997)\nalso stress the importance of presenting problems that are meaningful, and giving\nstudents a reason to want to use computer technology as a part of their\neducation.\nTaking such factors into account, it was decided to develop inPractice as a\ntutorial package, but one that would incorporate elements of assessment and deci-\nsion-making. The program would also provide students with feedback on the\n70 B. Ip et al.\nquality of their decisions. Provision for delivering the appropriate learning envi-\nronment (e.g. encouraging group work) and for developing relevant and interest-\ning scenarios was also considered. These issues are discussed in more detail in the\nfollowing section.\nThe design of inPractice\nGeneral design aspects of inPractice\nAs noted by Laurillard (2002, p. 134), tutorial-based CAL packages contain an\nexplicit teaching strategy. For inPractice, the primary objectives have been to enhance\nstudents\u2019 knowledge of meningitis, and to incorporate an element of decision-making\nand problem-solving. In order to develop a package appropriate to these needs,\nconsiderable emphasis was placed on design aspects such as providing a clear outline\nof the learning objectives, obtaining regular input from students to gauge their\nprogress, and the delivery of multimedia material.\nProgram implementation\nAfter the completion of beta testing to elicit usability and content issues (see later),\nsecond-year and third-year nursing students at the school were assigned one-hour\npractical classes where inPractice was (and still is) used. Since, from their first-year\nstudy, these students already possessed a degree of knowledge with respect to the\nbasic principles of nursing practice as well as the relevant IT skills, it was believed that\nthey would easily acclimatise to the content of inPractice. The aim of the practical\nclasses was to provide students with an introduction to the program, and to give assis-\ntance on any technical issues that might arise. Each scenario requires around one\nhour to complete, and the students were encouraged to use the program in their own\ntime in addition to the timetabled classes.\nScenario construction\nThere are two meningitis scenarios in inPractice. One deals with meningococcal\ndisease, and the other with pneumonia and secondary meningitis. The eLearning\nteam at the school has been continuously developing such scenarios since 2001.\nThey deal with various aspects of how cases of meningitis can develop and how they\ncan be treated. Each scenario integrates combinations of textual information and\nvideo clips (including interleaved sound) of around two to three minutes, and each\nshows the development of a patient\u2019s condition. The dialogue requires a response\nfrom the student before the next set of information is presented. In collaboration\nwith The Meningitis Trust, the scenarios were constructed with the help of experi-\nenced health professionals who worked closely with the design team and nursing\nlecturers in order to ensure that the material was both accurate and relevant for\nstudent nurses.\nA practical nursing package for clinical decisions 71\nScenario presentation\nEach scenario begins by presenting a preliminary set of basic information about the\ncase in point (e.g. the age of the patient and relevant history, and the symptoms) and\nabout the proposed learning outcomes. The program also provides general introduc-\ntory information about the case (see Figure 1), and a video clip illustrates the current\ncondition of the patient. Lohman and Finkelstein (2002) have shown that students\nare better able to solve problems when presented with scenarios segmented into\ncomparatively small sections, as compared with delivering large amounts of informa-\ntion all at once. The decision was therefore made to split each scenario into separate\nsections. Each scenario contains around 16 pages covering key aspects of the case\nsuch as diagnosis, treatment, and the recovery process.\nFigure 1. A typical introductory screen in an inPractice scenario\nPresentation of alternatives\nOnce a set of information has been presented, the student is given either a summary\nof patient information (requiring limited or no feedback from the user), a question\nbased on the current situation (see Figure 2 for an example of a typical question screen),\nor a decision point (Figure 3) before the next iteration of the scenario is displayed. It\nis well known that there are numerous problems related to methods of retrieving input\nFigure 1. A typical introductory screen in an inPractice scenario\n72 B. Ip et al.\nfrom students in order to measure their learning progress (see Laurillard, 2002,\npp. 134\u2013138). The best method for inPractice was considered by both content and\nprogram designers to be the use of multiple-choice questions to measure students\u2019\nbasic knowledge of key meningitis facts. The main reasons for this decision were that\nit would allow the program to provide an immediate response as to correct and\nincorrect answers without the complexities involved with open-ended questions, and\nthat some evidence exists to suggest that students prefer multiple choice over questions\nrequiring a discursive response (Reid & Arends, 1998). The questions, and the correct\nand incorrect answers, were written by the relevant lecturers and health professionals.\nFeedback and explanation of correct and incorrect answers are given as soon as the\nstudent has submitted a choice.\nFigure 2. A typical question screen in an inPractice scenario3 decisEach scenario contains two critical decision points. For example, in the first\nscenario, the student is required to decide on the course of action for each observation\ninterval of the patient where various pieces of information are given (such as blood\npressure, heart rate, and body temperature). Two options are provided, namely to\ncontinue with the observation (in this case, the correct answer) or to inform medical\nstaff of what the student perceives as significant changes in the observations. If the\ncorrect answer is given at each interval, an explanation of the choice is provided\u2014in\nthis instance giving reasons why it is necessary to continue observations or inform\nmedical staff. If an incorrect choice is made, the scenario develops accordingly\u2014in\nFigure 2. A typical question screen in an inPractice scenario\nA practical nursing package for clinical decisions 73\nthis case, the patient suffers if the student fails to inform medical staff at the appro-\npriate interval. The student is then given an explanation of the outcome, and\nprompted to revisit the decision point of the scenario to correct the original decision.\nIndividual study\/group work\nOnce the students have been presented with the question or decision point, they are\nencouraged to use their knowledge of the subject to come to an informed and\neducated response. They are helped by the program\u2019s built-in glossary and definitions\nof various clinical conditions and terminology, and can call on lecture notes, text-\nbooks, as well as learning via group work with other students. The work of Tennyson\net al. (1987), Tennyson (1988), and Maudsley and Strivens (2000), who argue that\npromoting group work is beneficial in terms of enhancing clinical judgement and\neffective decision-making, was taken into account in this context, and students are\nstrongly encouraged to work in groups.\nConsequence of the decision\/end of scenario\nAs already mentioned, feedback is given to students throughout each stage of the\nscenario, with correct or incorrect answers highlighted with explanations. Key decision\nFigure 3. A typical decision screen in an inPractice scenario\n74 B. Ip et al.\npoints allow the student to make the wrong decision, and see the consequences, before\nbeing given the opportunity to correct the decision. At the end of each scenario, a\nsummary of the learning outcomes is presented, and students are urged to consider\nfurther reading material and information (descriptions of various diseases, disorders,\nterminologies, etc.) built into the program. Figure 4 shows the general structure of a\nscenario.\nFigure 4. Structure of inPractice (diamond, information given by the program; square, student \nactivity; circle, application of knowledge)\nA practical nursing package for clinical decisions 75\nFigure 4. Structure of inPractice (diamond, information given by the program; square, student activity; circle, application of knowledge)Implementation study\nThe actual implementation of inPractice in 2002 was relatively trouble-free (apart\nfrom the all too common difficulty of the scheduling and organisation of practical\nclasses). General usability issues such as interface and navigation were also unprob-\nlematic\u2014the vast majority of students had sufficient IT knowledge to use the program\ncompetently (see the feedback analysis later).\nAs for content, the most significant design aspect of inPractice is that of enabling\nstudents to apply their existing knowledge to make decisions in various clinical\nsituations. As opposed to CAL packages that prescribe information, scenarios in\ninPractice present information in the form of details of a situation, just as a nurse\nor other health professional would have in real life. While students are given the\noption to refer to terms and definitions, the design of the program is centred on\nstimulating active participation, which requires self-study in order to answer ques-\ntions and to make the correct decisions at key points. Students are clearly shown\nthe consequences of making an incorrect decision, and how it affects the patient, a\nfeature that has already received positive feedback from both students and lectur-\ners. Indeed, initial indications from students, lecturers, and health professionals\ngenerally show very positive attitudes towards the program. Encouragingly, lectur-\ners have observed repeated and frequent use of it by students in their spare time\n(some have even enquired about obtaining their own version for use at home, and\neven at the ward during placement), something that, as highlighted by Finlay\n(1989, pp. 149\u2013155), is often a factor that represents a meaningful measure of\nsuccess.\nBefore inPractice was incorporated into the course, a beta test was conducted to\ngather feedback in a practical session where the package was used by a group of 35\nstudents for one hour in order to provide a basis from where content and usability\nissues, if any, could be raised. This gave sufficient time for students to study and\ncomplete at least one of the two scenarios. None of the students had used inPractice\nbefore, but all had experience with using computers and existing CAL packages at the\nschool. A lecturer and IT supervisor were present to provide content and technical\nassistance. Students were given a brief introduction, and asked to work through the\nprogram either individually or in small groups.\nAfter the session, all users completed a brief questionnaire designed to obtain\npreliminary feedback of general usability and content issues. All but one respon-\ndent were female, and between the ages of 18 and 35 years. The majority (80%)\nwere enrolled on the Nursing Diploma course and most had achieved at least\nGCSE and A-level qualifications. The main questions were constructed using\nfive-point Likert scales. The respondents were then asked to participate in a short\nfocus-group session to discuss the salient points in greater detail. To make the\nnumbers more manageable for discussion, students were split into two groups,\nand interviews were conducted in separate rooms by an interviewer. The follow-\ning is a discussion of the key findings obtained in the questionnaire and focus\ngroups.\n76 B. Ip et al.\nUsability\nUsers were first asked how well they rated the package overall. Promisingly, more\nthan 88% of respondents (31 out of 35) rated it as \u2018very good\u2019 or \u2018excellent\u2019. Only\nthree considered the program to be average, and on inspection of their written\ncomments it appeared that possible reasons might include the construction of the text\nand video clips, which some users found a little too long. Four further questions were\nasked in order to examine usability issues in greater detail. Two of these questions\nrelated to navigation and ease of use. There were positive results for both, with the\nmajority of respondents either agreeing or strongly agreeing with the statement that\nit was easy to navigate around the program (30 students; 88%). All respondents either\nagreed or strongly agreed that the program was easy to use, and comments supported\nthis result.\nContent\nThe first two questions in this section examined the decision-making aspects of the\nprogram. Students were asked whether they found the decision points realistic, and\nif they appreciated having to consider different options. The responses were generally\npositive about the use and design of decision points within the program; 76% indicat-\ning that the decision points seemed realistic, and 94% stating that they liked being\ngiven the opportunity to make decisions at critical points in the scenario. Of signifi-\ncance were comments given during discussions in the focus group, which included: \nThe program really made me think. I enjoyed having the opportunity to make decisions I\nwould be expected to make when I qualify.\nPlease can we have more lessons like this where you have to think, and are easy to relate\nto practice!\nA very good way of learning\u2014it\u2019s good to make decisions and to be given the rationale as\nto whether they were wrong and why.\nI think that this program is extremely good for student nurses allowing them to make their\nown decisions.\nOne respondent, however, suggested: \nPerhaps some more interactive points\/decision-making demands, e.g. what do you think\nshould happen next?\nTwelve further questions were asked to get an indication of whether students felt\nthat their knowledge of meningitis issues had been enhanced by the program. The\nquestions ranged from recognising the symptoms of meningitis, and the importance\nof keeping a close observation of the patient, to the pathophysiological processes\nassociated with pneumococcal meningitis and the ongoing management and care of\na patient recovering from the illness. An analysis of the results showed that the vast\nmajority of users felt their knowledge of these various aspects of meningitis had\nimproved since using the program, and even some respondents with practical\nA practical nursing package for clinical decisions 77\nmeningitis-related nursing experience said they had learnt something new about the\nsubject. While this result must be considered tentative as regards the true effective-\nness of inPractice in terms of knowledge enhancement, the initial signs are indeed\npromising. Feedback from a control group will be gathered in the next research\nphase in order to establish the validity of the results so far produced.\nComments from the focus groups gave some useful indication as to how they felt\nthe program compares with traditional lectures, and confirm some of the initial\nadvantages expected from the use of CAL: \nLearned more from the program than from lectures.\nYou could learn at your own pace.\nYou could use the program to read around the subject and use the reference list provided.\nConclusions and further work\nThe results are reassuring. While there is room for improvement in some aspects of\nthe program\u2019s design (such as interface and decision points\u2014suggestions that will be\ntaken into account during further development), it appears that its initial implemen-\ntation and general aspects can be considered successful. More importantly, students\nfelt positive about the content, and in particular about the decision points, which\nhelped them carefully to consider and apply knowledge in relevant scenarios. A more\ndetailed and longer-term evaluation of the package is currently being undertaken in\norder to determine its effectiveness in terms of knowledge enhancement as compared\nwith traditional lectures, and in particular whether students feel more confident about\nmaking clinical and ethical decisions with the help of inPractice and its problem-solving\nand decision-making approach.\nThere is, in any event, certainly scope for further scenarios to be written to cover a\nwider range of clinical situations, and since the multimedia design aspects of inPrac-\ntice play a crucial role, research is continuously being undertaken to investigate the\nsuitability of various ways of delivering information (e.g. by examining the effective-\nness of different filming perspectives for video clips). However, since each scenario\ndemands considerable resources (information from experts, filming, scenario design\nand construction, and ultimately financing), there is a limit as to how many of these\ncan be developed in a reasonable time-frame and within a restricted budget.\nAt present, each scenario offers only two key decision points. Nevertheless, inPrac-\ntice shows that there is significant potential for the development of an extended CAL\npackage incorporating a much greater number of decision points. The structure of\nsuch a package is likely to resemble that of modern-day educational and video games,\nas discussed by Leary (1995), and briefly by Laurillard (2002, p. 143) where the\nnumber of decisions to be made is enormous, and their consequences immediate to\nthe user. Given that the use of game-based approaches in the context of teaching has\nso far been relatively scarce, there appears to be some potential for development in\nthis area.\n78 B. Ip et al.\nFurthermore, while inPractice seems to help promote decision-making and\nproblem-solving skills, the design team feels that it could also be usefully modified\nand extended into a more rigorous evaluation tool. A possible idea is that it would be\nused as a general introduction to typical clinical scenarios to provide students with a\nfeel for the type of clinical decision-making situations they are likely to encounter in\nreal life. The structure of the program, which includes the use of multiple-choice\nquestions and decision points, is well suited for beginners (such as first-year students)\nand those with a limited nursing background for them to develop knowledge-\napplication and decision skills. For more advanced users (such as final-year degree\nstudents), a more demanding version of the program could be developed to test for\nempirical evidence as to whether or not users have improved in their decision-making\nand problem-solving skills. A student could, for instance, be presented with symp-\ntoms of an illness, from where he\/she would be required to ask a hypothetical patient\nan initial question (\u2018where does it hurt\u2019, or \u2018how long has it been hurting for?\u2019), before\nthe system branches into a decision point at each subsequent stage. Developed with\nformal application of decision-evaluation techniques in mind, a more complex evalu-\nation package could probably incorporate such analyses to good effect. Applied in\nconjunction with inPractice, such a program would provide a useful evaluation tool\nto deliver a holistic delivery and assessment of nursing education and training.\nReferences\nAitken, V., Lewis, A. & Booton, P.
