The natural lexicographic semigroupoids associated with Cantor product\nspaces indexed by countable linear orders are classified. Applications are given to the\nclassification of triangular operator algebras which are direct limits of upper-triangular\nmatrix algebras.\n0. Introduction\nConsider a Cantor space which is presented explicitly as an infinite product of finite\ntopological spaces. The product presentation provides an equivalence relation R\nconsisting of the pairs (x,y) of points x and y which disagree in at most finitely\nmany coordinates. This equivalence relation supports a natural locally compact totally\ndisconnected topology which makes R a principal groupoid. It is well-known that\nin the case of countable products such topological equivalence relations are classified\nby the generalised integer obtained from the formal product of the cardinalities of the\ncomponent spaces. Furthermore, this classification is closely related to the classification\nof C*-algebras that are infinite tensor products of matrix algebras, the so-called UHF\nC*-algebras. See, for example, Renault [10] and Power [7].\nIn the present paper we consider antisymmetric topological binary relations which\nare the lexicographic topological subrelations arising from infinite products indexed by\ngeneral countable linear orderings. These natural semigroupoids are classified and their\nautomorphism groups determined. This and related results enable us to give applications\nto the classification of triangular operator algebras which are themselves lexicographic\nproducts in an algebraic sense.\nThe binary relations may also be viewed as the (semigroupoid) lexicographic products\nof total orderings on finite sets, and in fact our methods are applicable to lexicographic\nproducts of connected antisymmetric finite partial orders. Although applications to\napproximately finite operator algebras provide our primary motivation, it seems clear\nthat lexicographic subrelations are interesting in their own right.\nIn \u00a7 1 we recall how the generalised integer associated with the presentation of the\nCantor space gives a complete invariant for the associated approximately finite groupoid.\nIn \u00a72 we classify the lexicographic products in the case of indexing by a countable dense\n366 S. C. Power\norder. It is interesting that the proof here is much more elementary than the case of\nindexing by Z which is taken up in \u00a73. Indeed, the classification in the former case is\nless subtle and suggests, a posteriori, that the component coordinates must be accessible\nin purely order-topological terms. The proof in \u00a73 follows the order-topological methods\nin Power [8] where automorphisms of the associated triangular algebras were studied.\nThese algebras\u2014the so-called alternation algebras\u2014have been considered by a number\nof authors, namely Poon [6], Hopenwasser and Power [4], and most recently, as part of a\nwider analysis, by Donsig and Hopenwasser [3]. Also in \u00a73 we identify the automorphism\ngroup of a lexicographic product over Z. In \u00a74 we obtain the classification for the case\nof general countable linear orders and in the last section we give applications to operator\nalgebras.\n1. Preliminaries\nLet (JL be a positive integer-valued function defined on a countable linear ordering Q.\nFor notational convenience we denote the discrete finite topological space { 1 , . . . , n) by\n[\u00ab]. Associate with \\i the Cantor space\nwhere rw = fi(w). Write \/?M for the equivalence relation described \u00a70. Let \/?M be\nthe antisymmetric subrelation of points (x,y) e R^, for which x preceeds y in the\nlexicographic ordering. Thus (y, x) e R^ if and only if x = (xw) and y = (yw), the\ncoordinates (xw) and (yw) are equal except in at most a finite number of coordinates,\nand yw < xw for the first index w where x and y differ.\nThe basic open-closed sets for the Cantor space X^ are provided by the cylinder sets\narising from the specification of a finite number of coordinates. The topology on \/?M\narises in the following similar way. Let F c \u00a32 be a finite subset, let x'w, y'w be specified\ncoordinates for w e F, and let\nE = {(x, y):xw= yw for w i F, xw = x'w and yw = y'w for w e F}.\nThe totality of these sets gives a base for the groupoid topology on R^ and the subrelation\nRp carries the relative topology.\nNotice that if 717, nr : \/?M \u2014> X^ are the natural coordinate projections then n\\ and\nnr are continuous and are one-to-one when restricted to a basic open-closed set E.\nGeneral open-closed sets with this property are called G-sets and these are important\nin the following two ways. Firstly they provide a class of sets which are invariant\nunder groupoid isomorphism, that is, a binary relation isomorphism that is also a\nhomeomorphism. Secondly they are used in the formulation of invariant measures on\nthe underlying space. As a consequence groupoid isomorphisms conserve the invariant\nmeasures.\nAn invariant measure for a principal groupoid R is a Borel measure A. for the\nunderlying topological space such that X(iTi(G)) \u2014 X{nr{G)) for every G-set G. It is a\nsimple matter to check that \/?M possesses a unique invariant probability measure, namely\nthe infinite product of the probability measures Xw on [rw] which assign equal mass r~x to\nLexicographic semigroupoids 367\neach singleton set. At this stage we can deduce that if R^ is isomorphic to the topological\nequivalence relation Rv, associated with v : A ->\u2022 N, then the generalised integers for \/x\nand v agree. Indeed, the hypothesised isomorphism is a bijection a : X^ -*\u2022 Xv such\nthat the map a(2) : R^ -*\u2022 Rv is a bijection and a topological isomorphism. Since the\ninvariant probability measures for R^ and Rv are unique they must correspond under a,\nand from this it follows that they have the same range on open-closed sets. Thus the set\nof rationals k\/r, with i t e Z and r = rWlrW2 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 rWn for some n e N, coincides with the\ncorresponding set of rationals for v. Equivalently\nas generalised integers.\nIn the antisymmetric context we shall use the argument given above in a local way\n(with various restrictions of R^ in place of R^) to obtain local comparisons of the data\nfor two given lexicographic binary relations.\nFor x in X^ the (one-sided) orbit of x is the set O(x) of points y with (y, x) e R^,\nand the closed orbit of x is O(x) the closure of this set. Note that if x = (xw) with\nxw = 1 for all w < w\\ and xw = \/x(u>) for all w > w\\, for some w\\ in \u00a32, then O(x) is\nthe set of points y = (yw) with yw = 1 for w < w\\. This will be indicated by setting\n>\u201e,, = 1 and writing\nO(x) = (.A..\\yWl\\..*..).\nA similar such shorthand is used in the next section to indicate basic open-closed sets\nin Xn. Note that for the particular point x above the restriction R^ | O(x) is isomorphic\nto a lexicographic ordering.\n2. Countable dense orders\nIn this section we classify the topological binary relations \/?M in the cases when Q is a\ndense linear ordering and \\i : Si \u2014*\u2022 N satisfies n(w) > 2 for all w in Q. There are only\nfour such linear orderings and these correspond to the presence and absence of maximal\nand minimal elements.\nTHEOREM I. Let H : Q ->\u2022 N\\{1} and v : \u00a32' ->\u2022 N\\{1} be functions on the countable\ndense linear orderings Q and \u00a32'. Then the lexicographic semigroupoids R^ and Rv\nare isomorphic if and only if there is an order bijection n : Q. \u2014> \u00a32' such that\nv(n(w)) = fjt-(w) for all w in \u00a32.\nProof. Assume first that \u00a32 and \u00a32' have no minimal elements.\nObserve that a point x = (xw) in XM has a closed orbit O(x) which is a proper subset\nof X^ if and only if there exists an index of t in \u00a32 such that xw \u2014 1 for all w <t. Indeed,\nassume that this does not hold and consider an arbitrary point y in X^. For an index\ns e \u00a32, with xs > 1, let zs = (zw) where zw = yw for w < s, zs = xs \u2014 1, and zw \u2014 xw\nfor w > s. If A is a basic open neighbourhood of y then, from the assumption, it follows\nthat there exists an element zs in A. Since (zs,x) e R^ the observation follows.\n368 S. C. Power\nDivide the set of points with proper closed orbit into two types. A point X is of type 1\nif there exists a first index w\\ such that *\u201e,, \/ I , and is of type 2 otherwise. We claim\nthat x is type 1 if and only if O(x) contains a closed orbit O(y) which is a relatively\nopen-closed proper subset. This property identifies the indexing in order topological\nterms and is the basis of the proof.\nIf x is a type 2 point then there is an order interval decompositions ft = ft] + ft2,\nwhere ft2 has no first element, such that y belongs to the closed orbit of x if and only if\ny = (yw) with yw = 1 for w e fti. To see this let ft] be the largest order ideal in ft of\nindices w with xw \u2014 1. Thus ft = fti + ft2, where ft2 has no first element and for any\nindex u in ft2 there is a smaller index v with xv > 1. In particular O{x) contains the set\n( . . 1 . . | x B - l | . . * . . ) \u2022\nThe union of all such sets is dense in the set\nO{x) = {..\\.. | ..*..)\nassociated with the decomposition of ft. It follows that O(x) is precisely this latter set,\nas required.\nA relatively open-closed subset of O{x) contains a basic relatively open-closed\nneighbourhood of the form\n( . . l . . | . . * ..\\Zwi\\- * -\\Zwi\\- * . . , . . . , . . * -\\ZwJ- * \u2022\u2022)\nwith w\\ < W2 < \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 < wn. Such a set contains points z = (zw) with z, = 2 for all t\nin ft2 with t < w\\. Since O(z) = O(x) for such a point it follows that O(x) cannot\ncontain, properly, a relatively open-closed closed orbit.\nWe now identify the integers A4 (to) in order-topological terms.\nLet E c XM be an intersection of closed orbits of type 2 points which is not itself\na closed orbit of a type 2 point. Then, in view of the description above of the closed\norbits of type 2 points, E has the form\nfor some q in ft. From this set and the relation R^ we can discover \/x(q) in order-\ntopological terms as follows. There is a unique R^-invariant probability measure, X say,\non the set E(9). The sets\nare the only closed orbits contained in \u00a3( 9 ) with positive A. measure, and the reciprocal\nof the measure of the smallest such set is \/i-(^).\nSuppose now that a(2) : R^ -*\u2022 Rv is a semigroupoid isomorphism implemented by\na : X^ \u2014> Xv. In particular a is a homeomorphism. If p e ft' then write \u00a3 ( p ) for\nthe sets in Xv that are analogous to the subsets \u00a3 ( ? ) . Then from the paragraph above\nit follows that a{E^q)) = En(q) for some element n{q) in ft'. The map n is an order\nisomorphism and from the characterisation of the numbers ii(q) above it follows that\nv(it(q)) = \/x(q) for all q in ft.\nLexicographic semigroupoids 369\nSuppose, finally, that Q has a minimal element XVQ. Then all points of XM except the\nunique maximal point x^^. = (\/i,(tu)) have proper closed orbits. Also, the converse is\ntrue. Note that there exist open-closed orbits and a smallest open-closed orbit, namely\nSince this set is determined in order-topological terms we can restrict considerations to\nthis subset of X^ and deduce the theorem in this case from the one already considered. \u2022\n3. The case Q = a* +co\nA classification is now given for the lexicographic semigroupoids R^ in the case where,\nin the standard notation, \u00a32 has order type of + co. This order (integer) type is quite a bit\nmore subtle than that of the dense orders in that semigroupoid isomorphisms may have\nto be effected by homeomorphisms defined in terms of a recoding.\nThroughout this section assume that \u00a32 = Z\\{0} and that fx, v are maps from \u00a32 to\nZ+ with\n= rk, (J,(-k) = sk, v(k) = tk, v(-k) = uk.\nfor k = 1, 2 , . . . . Associate with \/x the pair (r, s) of generalised integers\nDefine an equivalence relation ~ on pairs of generalised (or finite) integers by (r_, s) ~\n(f, u) if and only if rs = tu_ and there exist coprime natural numbers a,b such that\n\u00a3>r = at_ and as_ = bu.\nTHEOREM 2. Let \/z., v : \u00a32 \u2014\u00bb\u2022 N, with associated pairs of generalised integers (possibly\nfinite) (r, s) and (if, u) respectively. Then the lexicographic semigroupoids R^ and Rv are\nisomorphic if and only if (r, s) ~ (\u00b1, u).\nProof. We prove the necessity of the condition for isomorphism. The sufficiency direction\nis relatively straightforward and is left to the reader. (See also [4] and [6].)\nLet a : X^ \u2014*\u2022 Xv be a bijection such that a(2' : R^ \u2014*\u2022 Rv is a topological\nisomorphism. The inversion map 6 : X^ x XM ->\u2022 XM x X^ given by 6{(x, x')) = (x', x)\nis an automorphism of the equivalence relation R^, and R^ = \/?M U S ( ^ ) . It follows\nthat a(2) maps R^ homeomorphically onto Rv. In particular, by the discussion in \u00a71, it\nfollows that the generalised integer for R^ coincides with that for Rv. That is, r s_ = t_u_.\nLet XMo Q Xn be the set of points x = (xk) with xk = 1 for sufficiently small k.\nIf XMo is a proper subset of XM then it is precisely the set of points in XM with proper\nclosed orbits, and so a(XM>0) = Xv$. The set XM,o contains the special points for which,\nin addition, xk = rk for all sufficiently large k. These special points can be characterised\norder topologically. Indeed they are precisely the points x for which there exists a point\nx\n+\n whose closed orbit O(x+) is the union of {x+} and O(x). These so-called gap points\nare discussed in [4] and [7]. Thus, if x\u00ab = ( . . . , 1,1, rit r2,...), where the symbol\nindicates the coordinate position k = 1, then a{x*) may be written as\n( . . . . 1, 1, t o -y+ i , w ; _ ; , . . . , Wj-U Uj,\n370 S. C. Power\nfor some positive integer j . We have\nO(xt) = ( . . . , 1 , 1 , * , * , . . . ) .\nand\nO(a{x,)) = { ( . . . , 1, w', yJt y j + 1 , ...):w'e Uj, w]}\nwhere yk < w* for k > j , and where w' is any word of length 2y \u2014 2 which preceeds, or\nis equal to, the word w = (w-j+\\,..., Wj-i). That is, w' belongs to the lexicographic\norder interval [ly, w] where 17- is the word with 2j \u2014 2 coordinates all equal to 1. Let\nn be the number of words in this order interval and note that the restricted topological\nequivalence relation Rv | O(a(x*)) has generalised integer ntjtj+i \u2022 \u2022 \u2022. Since a induces an\nisomorphism between this relation and the topological equivalence relation R^ \\ O{xt)\nthen, once again, by the discussion in \u00a71, we have ntjtj+i \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 = r\\r2--, and hence\nmr_ = nt_ where m = t\\t2- \u2022 \u2022 tj_\\. Although rs_ = tu_ we cannot yet conclude that\nDef ine dM : X M i 0 ->\u2022 R by\ni oo\nh Y^iX-k - 1)-S-O-Sl \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Sk-i,\n\u2022 \/ \u2022 *\nwhere SQ = 1, and define dv : Xv$ \u2014> R similarly. If x e O(xt) then we can interpret\nd^(x) as the measure of O{x) with respect to the unique normalised \/?M-invariant Borel\nmeasure on O(x*). Call this measure X^, and note that there is a unique ^-invariant\nextension to XKi0 which we also denote by X^.\nBecause of the uniqueness of normalised invariant measures it follows that Xv oa \u2014\ncX^ and dv(a(x)) = cd^x) for some positive constant c. Since <iM(*,) = 1 we have\nc \u2014 dv(a(x*)). To see that c = n\/m note that there are precisely m points in the product\n[t]] x \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 x [f\/_i]. Thus, from the definition of n and the product measure Xv we see that\nXv(O(a(xt))) = n\/m.\nWe now use the connection dv(a(x)) = cdv(x) to show that us = mu_. We can assume\nthat s_ and u_ are not finite.\nLet n\/m = a\/b where (a, b) \u2014 1 and suppose, by way of contradiction, that as_ does\nnot divide bu_. Then, there exists a prime number p and a positive integer g such that\nps | as_, pg~x | bu_, and ps J(bu_.\nChoose \/ large enough so that as\\ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 si = k\\p8 for some integer k\\.

Note that from the proof above it follows that the restrictions R^ \\ X^Q and\nRv | Xv<0 are isomorphic topological binary relatations if and only if R^ and Rv are\nisomorphic topological binary relations. We use this fact in the next section.\nRemark 2. As we mention later, there is a close association between approximately\nfinite topological binary relations and approximately finite triangular operator algebras.\nThe algebras associated with the Z-ordered relations above correspond to the so-\ncalled alternation algebras considered by Hopenwasser and Power [4] and by Poon\n[6]. Their classification is also given, as part of a more general study, by Donsig\nand Hopenwasser [3]. The argument we give above follows very closely the method\nof [8], which was restricted to the case fi = v. (There is an inadequacy in the arithmetic\nprogression argument of [8] which is corrected in the somewhat more general argument\nabove.)\nRemark 3. In principle it should be possible to reformulate the arguments of Poon [6]\nand Donsig and Hopenwasser [3] in terms of binary relations to give alternative proofs\nof Theorem 2. The arguments we have given are also suited to other situations and\nin particular to the generalised alternation algebras associated with Markov chains and\nsubshifts. (See [7].) We intend to report more fully on this elsewhere. However, let us\nnote the following example from [7].\nLet R^ be the lexicographic topological binary relation for Q. = Z with the function\nix(w) = 2 for all w. Let R\\ (resp. R2) be the topological subrelation defined on the\nsymbol subspace Xi (resp. X2) of X^ for which the pair 00 (resp. 11) is forbidden.\nThen, in contrast to their generated equivalence relations, R\\ and R2 are not isomorphic.\nSimilarly the one-sided subrelations are not isomorphic.\nAutomorphisms. Fix \/i, : \u00a32 \u2014> N as above with lexicographic semigroupoid R^ and\ngeneralised integer pair (r,, s). Let d be the number of primes p such that both r and s_\nare divisible by p\u00b0\u00b0.\nTHEOREM 3. [8] The semigroupoid automorphism group A\u00abf(\/?M) is isomorphic to the\nrestricted direct product 7Ld.\nProof. An element a(2) e A\u00abf (\/?M) is a topological isomorphism induced by a bijection\na : XM -*\u2022 XK. By the argument in the proof of Theorem 2, specialized to the case\nix = v, we have\nd^aix)) = cd^x)\nfor x e X^o, where c = a\/b with (a, b) = 1, ar_ = br_, and bs_ = as_. Furthermore,\nif c = 1 then a is trivial. These conditions imply that a\u00b0\u00b0 and b\u00b0\u00b0 divide r and s_. It\nfollows that c has the form p\\] pe22 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 pekk where e, e Z and each pi divides r and \u00a3 with\ninfinite multiplicity. The mapping a ->\u2022 c gives the desired isomorphism. \u2022\nSuppose that p is a prime such that p\u00b0\u00b0 divides r_ and s_. We note one way in which\nthe order-preserving homeomorphism a corresponding to p~x may be identified.\nLexicographic semigroupoids 373\nWrite r_ = pr\\pr2prj, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 and s_ = S\\ps2ps^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 and obtain the identification\nX\u00bb = (\u2022\u2022\u2022[s2] x [p] x [ j , ] ) x {[p] x [n] x [p] x \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 )\n^ x X + .\nThis is natural ly i somorph ic to\nXx = (\u2022\u2022\u2022[p]x[si]x[p])x([ri]x[p]x[r2]x--)\nX{x X+\nby a map \/3 = j6~ x f}+ which respects the factors and which induces the natural\nsemigroupoid isomorphism R^ \u2014> R^. Let y : X), \u2014> X^ be the right shift\nhomeomorphism. Then y o ft is an automorphism of X^ and its associated constant\nis p~\\\n4. Countable linear orderings\nLet \u00a31 be a countable linear ordering and define an equivalence relation \u00ab on \u00a32 such that\nIU % D if the order intervals [to, i>] and [i\u00bb, w] are finite. Then the set \u00a32\/ \u00ab of equivalence\nclasses is linearly ordered and each equivalence class (x) is itself a linearly ordered set\nwhich is isomorphic to a finite set or to one of Z + , Z_ and Z. Let fi : \u00a32 \u2014\u2022 (2, 3 , . . . } .\nThen to each class (JC> we can associate a pair p^Hx)) = (r, s), as in \u00a73, consisting of\nfinite or generalized integers.\nTHEOREM 4. Let \u00a32, A be countable linear orderings with maps \/x : \u20ac1 -*\u2022 {2, 3 , . . .} ,\nv : A -\u00bb {2, 3 , . . .} . Then the lexicographic semigroupoids R^ and Rv are isomorphic\nif and only if there is an order preserving bijection it : \u00a31\/ & \u2014> A\/ & such that\nPn({w)) for all classes (w) in Q\/ \u00ab .\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 1, declare a point x = (xw) in X^ to be a type 1\npoint if there exists a first coordinate w for which xw ^ 1. Once again, as in the proof\nof Theorem 1, these points are identifiable in order-topological terms as those for which\nthe closed (half) orbit O{x) properly contains relatively open-closed closed orbits. If\nu>2 > u>\\ then say that w\\ and w2 are finitely equivalent if there exist type 1 points\nx, y with first non-unit coordinates xWl and yW2 respectively such that O(y) has positive\nmeasure with respect to the unique invariant probability Borel measure on O(x).\nNote that W] and w2 are finitely equivalent if and only if w\\ \u00ab w2. In view of\nthis it follows that if a(2) : R^ ->\u2022 Rv is a topological isomorphism induced by the\nhomeomorphism a then a induces a map n : Q\/ ~ \u2014*\u2022 A\/ s\u00bb. Indeed, if x is a type 1\npoint associated with w in Q then a(jt) is a type 1 point associated with u in A and\nwe may define n({w)) = (\u00ab). Since the equivalence relation \u00ab* coincides with finite\nequivalence this is a well-defined bijection.\nFix a class (tu), for some w e fi, and define the set\n= |J\nwhere the union is taken over the set T(w) of type 1 points x associated with the class\n(w). Then a restricts to a homeomorphism\n374 S. C. Power\nBy considering the restriction of a(2) to the set\nwe shall show that the lexicographic semigroupoid R({w), n) associated with the linear\norder (w) and the function \/x is isomorphic to R(n({w)), v). In view of the result in \u00a73\nthis will complete the proof.\nTo this end define the equivalence relation \u00a3M on XM((iu)) as the set of pairs (x, y)\nfor which xu = yu for all u in (w), and similarly define Ev on Xv(n((w))). Thus, the\nset of equivalence classes X^w^\/E^ is isomorphic to the set\nFurthermore, R^ and \u00a3M induce a binary relation, R^\/E^ say, on the set XM({\nThat is (x,y) e R^\/E^ if and only if there exist*', y'inXM((w\u00bb with (x', y') e R,t,x' e\nx and y' e y. Also, under the natural identification above R^\/E^ is the lexicographic\nsemigroupoid R((w), \/A) on X(w).\nIn view of these identifications it will be enough to show that the equivalence relation\nE^ can be defined in an order-topological fashion and that the restriction of a to XM((u>))\ninduces a semigroupoid isomorphism from R((w), fi) to R(n((w)), fi).\nIn \u00a72 we saw that, up to a constant multiplier, the set XM({tt>)) carries a unique\n^-invariant measure, A.M say. If x, y e X^dw)) and XM(0(;c)) = A-M(O(y)) then there\nare two possibilities; either xu = yu for all u in (w), or xu and yu correspond to 'rational\npoints' in the sense that the symmetric difference O(x)AO(y) is a singleton, namely [x]\nor {y}. It follows that E^ can be defined purely in order-topological terms and hence\nthat a maps the is^-equivalence classes to \u00a3u-equivalence classes.\nSince the given map a : XM -*\u2022 Xv is continuous and since the basic open-closed\nsets of X^ and XH generate the topology of X^ and XM, respectively, it follows that the\ninduced map\na,- : XM((u;\u00bb\/\u00a3M -+ Xv(n((w)))\/Ev\nis bicontinuous. Indeed a maps an ^-saturated basic open-closed set to an \u00a3y-saturated\nopen-closed set and this is necessarily a finite union of \u00a3p-saturated basic open-closed\nsets. Similarly, it follows that aj2) induces a semigroupoid isomorphism from R((w), \/x)\nto R(n({w)), fi). a\nThe arguments given above and in the previous section are also effective in the\nsetting of infinite lexicographic products of partially ordered sets. This is illustrated in\nthe following theorem in the case \u00a31 = Q for which the proof in \u00a72 is applicable with\nlittle change.\nFor each rational q e Q let <q be a connected partial ordering on the finite set\n{I,..., fi(q)}. Then the product space XM carries a natural semigroupoid\nR = R({<q: q e Q}),\nwhich is the subset of R^ associated with the given partial orderings. That is, (x, y) e R\nif and only if (x, y) e R^ and xWo <q yWo for the smallest index wQ such that xw ^ yw.\nLexicographic semigroupoids 375\nTHEOREM 5. The semigroupoids R{{<q: q \u20ac Q}) and R({<q: q e Q}) are isomorphic if\nand only if there is an order bijection n : Q \u2014*\u2022 Q such that the partial orderings <q and\n<n(q) are isomorphic for all q 6 Q.\n5. Applications to operator algebras\nThe operator algebra Tn is the subalgebra of the complex matrix algebra Mn consisting\nof upper-triangular complex matrices and endowed with the usual operator norm. These\nalgebras A are triangular in the sense that A C\\ A* is a maximal abelian self-adjoint\nsubalgebra. Recently there has been considerable interest in classifying the many diverse\nfamilies of triangular operator algebras arising as direct limits of these finite-dimensional\nalgebras and their direct sums (see [7]). These algebras can also be viewed as triangular\nsubalgebras of groupoid C*-algebras (see Renault [10] or Muhly and Solel [5]).\nThe following construction is given in [9].\nLet \u00a3l,fj, be as above, with nw = fi{w). Let F c \u00a32 be a finite subset, say\nu>\\ < u>2 < \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 < wit.-* a nd let w, < w < wt+\\, for some t. Set G = F U {w},\nnf = nWlnW2 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 nWk, and \u00ab c = n^np. Define a unital algebra injection 4>F,G '\u2022 TnF -*\u2022 Tnc\nas follows. View TnF as the (maximal triangular) subalgebra of Mnw <S> \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <3) Mnw which\nis spanned by the matrix units\nwhere the multi-index i = (i\\,..., i*) precedes j = ( j i , . . . , jk) in the lexicographic\nordering. Thus either i = j or the first ip differing from j p is strictly less than j p .\nSimilarly identify Tna for the ordered subset G and set cj>Fa to be the linear extension\nof the correspondence\n. v = l\nIn a similar way, or by composing maps of the above type, define 4>F,G f\u00b0r F c G,\ngeneral finite subsets. These maps are isometric and so determine the Banach algebra\nTnF,\nwhere the direct limit is taken over the directed set T of finite subsets of Q. Each 4>F,G\nhas an extension to a C*-algebra injection from MnF to Mnc and so it follows that we may\nview A(Q, v) as a closed unital subalgebra of the UHF C*-algebra fi(fi, v) = UmMnF.\nTHEOREM 6. The following statements are equivalent.\n(i) A(Q, \/A) and A(A, v) are isometrically isomorphic Banach algebras.\n(ii) \/?M and Rv are isomorphic lexicographic semigroupoids.\n(iii) There is an order preserving bijection n : Q\/ ^\u2014>\u2022 A\/ \u00ab such that\nfor all classes (w) in \u00a31\/\n376 S. C. Power\nProof. The semigroupoids are readily identifiable with the topological fundamental\nrelations of the operator algebras. (See, for example, the discussions of [4] and [7].) The\nequivalence of (i) and (ii) is now immediate from Theorem 7.5 of [7] and so Theorem 4\ncompletes the equivalences. \u2022\nAn immediate corollary of the last theorem is that there are uncountably many\ntriangular algebras A of the form A (ft, \/z) with C*{A) equal to the 2\u00b0\u00b0 UHF C*-\nalgebra. On the other hand there are only three such (infinite-dimensional) algebras\nof the form A(Z, p.), namely the pure refinement algebra, the standard limit algebra and\nthe alternation algebra with invariant (2\u00b0\u00b0, 200). We remark that if ft fails to have a first\nelement then the operator algebras A (ft, n) have trivial Jacobson radical (see [2] and\n[9]).\nWe now explain how the algebras above can also be interpreted in term of a\nlexicographic product operation at the algebraic level, as described in [9].\nLet A be an operator algebra admitting a subdiagonal decomposition in the sense that\nA = A n A* + A0,\nwhere AHA* is a maximal abelian subalgebra of A , and A0 is the kernel of a contractive\nhomomorphism A -\u00bb\u2022 A D A*. In particular, this holds if A is a regular triangular\nsubalgebra of an AF C*-algebra ([7] or, more generally, if A is a subdiagonal algebra\nin the sense of Arveson [1]). If A and B are triangular operator algebras admitting such\ndecompositions then define their lexicographic product A \u2022 B to be the closed subalgebra\nof the injective tensor product C*{A) <g> C\"{B) given by\nA \u2022 B = (A n A*) \u00ae B + A0 <g> C*(B).\nOne can verify that the inclusions 4>F,G defined above coincide with the natural\ninclusions\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Tnwi \u2022 Tnw * Tnwi+i * - - - * T n\nwt.\nIn fact the lexicographic product is an associative operation and the algebras A (ft, fi) can\nbe viewed (unambiguously) as infinite lexicographic products of upper-triangular matrix\nalgebras over the ordering ft. The following theorem is a corollary of Theorem 5.\nTHEOREM 7. Let Gq and Hq for q in Q be connected transitive antisymmetric digraphs\nwith triangular digraph algebras A{Gq) and A(Hq). Then the lexicographic products\n\\\\*A{Gq) and f]*A(fl',)\n96\u00ab2 qeQ\nare isometrically isomorphic triangular operator algebras if and only if there is an order\nbijection n such that the digraphs Gq and Hn(q) are isomorphic for all rationals q.\nLexicographic semigroupoids 377\nREFERENCES\n[1] W.
