GIC can cause power transformer saturation which can lead to the overload of\nequipment and malfunction of protective measures installed in the power network (e.g. Molin-\nski 2002). Perhaps the most well-known GIC event is associated with the so-called March 1989\n\u2018super-storm\u2019 (Bell et al. 1997) during which the Hydro Que\u00b4bec power system collapsed (Boteler\net al. 1998). More recently, GIC caused an hour long power cut in southern Sweden (e.g. Pulkkinen\net al. 2005).\nThe geoelectric field is a key quantity (e.g. Viljanen & Pirjola 1994) since the size of GIC is\nrelated directly to its magnitude. To investigate the flow of GIC in a power network we need to\nunderstand how the geoelectric field responds to a geomagnetic disturbance. The modelling of GIC\nis often broken down into two parts (e.g. Pirjola 2002). First the geoelectric field is determined,\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 3\nand then the GIC caused by the geoelectric field are calculated using a suitable model of the power\nnetwork. In this paper, we concentrate on determining the geoelectric field.\nModels of the geoelectric field during particular idealised disturbances are often used to inves-\ntigate GIC flow. For example, Viljanen et al. (1999) modelled a number of different ionospheric\ndisturbances to investigate the occurrence of large GIC. Their main finding was that large GIC\noccur during very different geomagnetic events with the main requirement being a large and rapid\nchange of the geomagnetic field. They highlighted the need for accurate models of the Earth\u2019s\nconductivity structure to derive reliable estimates of GIC. However, as was the case with the study\nof Viljanen et al. (1999), GIC estimates are usually based on one-dimensional Earth conductivity\nmodels.\nOne possibility which has received little attention is the use of measurements of the geoelectric\nfield to investigate GIC. However, the geoelectric field is seldom monitored continuously. Where\nmeasurements of the electric field are made, as in a Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, the data are\nprocessed to estimate the MT tensor. Estimates of the MT tensor are, in turn, used to infer the\nconductivity structure of the Earth. However, where we have sufficient data, we can still use the\nMT tensors to estimate the size and spatial distribution of the geoelectric field directly. The ad-\nvantage of estimating the electric field using the MT tensors is that such estimates are based on\nthe measurements of the electric field rather than a conductivity model derived from both the elec-\ntric and magnetic data. However, using the measured MT tensor presents two challenges. Firstly,\ndistortion of MT measurements due to the galvanic response of bodies too small, or shallow, to\nbe involved in induction in the period range of interest is a major problem in the interpretation\nof MT data (e.g. Groom & Bahr 1992). Galvanic distortion causes the well-known \u2018static-shift\u2019\nof the MT apparent resistivity parameter, whose magnitude is shifted up or down by an unknown\namount in a frequency independent manner (e.g. Spitzer 2001). Secondly, the spatial distribution\nof the available long period (> 200 s) MT data is poor. While there is little we can do to improve\nthe spatial coverage, other than making more measurements, tensor decomposition techniques are\navailable to mitigate the problem of galvanic distortion (e.g. Groom & Bailey 1989; Smith 1995).\nThe northern England and central and southern Scotland (NESS) region is an ideal place to\n4 A.J. McKay\ninvestigate the utility of MT data in the prediction of GIC in a power network for two reasons.\nFirstly, the NESS region is covered by the Scottish Power high voltage electricity transmission\nnetwork, and encompasses the geological terranes of the Midland Valley, Southern Uplands and\nConcealed Caledonides. Secondly, numerous electromagnetic (EM) induction studies have inves-\ntigated the crustal conductivity structure of NESS, from Edwards et al. (1971) to Tauber et al.\n(2003); see Livelybrooks et al. (1993) and Banks et al. (1996) for a fuller list of references. The\nregion has been the subject of intense geophysical (and geological) study because it is thought to\nbe the site of the Iapetus Suture Zone (ISZ). The ISZ corresponds to the join between the crust\nof North American (Laurentian) affinity (to the north), and European (Avalonian) affinity (to the\nsouth); it also marks the site of the closure of the Iapetus Ocean (Livelybrooks et al. 1993).\nTwo major conductivity anomalies have been identified using the Geomagnetic Deep Sound-\ning (GDS) technique: the Southern Upland and Northumberland Trough anomalies (Banks et al.\n1983). The two most recent MT surveys in the region were designed to determine the origin of\nthese two anomalies (Banks et al. 1996), and improve the resolution in the depth range 1-15 km\n(Tauber et al. 2003). While the main lithological and structural boundaries are aligned NE-SW, as-\nsociated features may have been disrupted by subsequent faulting, and the complex crustal struc-\nture of the ISZ region will affect the spatial distribution of the geoelectric field in a frequency\ndependent manner. For example, Beamish et al. (2002) employed a simplified 3D model of the\nUK resistivity distribution to estimate the surface electric field for various amplitudes and ori-\nentations of external magnetic field variations. Their model included crustal scale variations in\nconductivity, which were restricted to terrane boundaries, and the effect of the coastal conductiv-\nity contrast. They highlighted the complex redistribution of the electric field amplitude and phase\ndue to both.\nHypothetical event analysis (HEA), where the anomalous internal magnetic fields associated\nwith a \u2018hypothetical\u2019 event due to a uniform horizontal magnetic induction of given magnitude,\npolarisation and phase, has proved a powerful technique to provide a picture of anomalous currents\nflowing in response to conductivity structure (e.g. Banks et al. 1983; Egbert & Booker 1993). In\nthis paper, we consider a single variation period of 750 s which is representative of a mode of\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 5\ninduction in a period range which extends from 200 to 2000 s (e.g. Banks & Beamish 1984),\nwhere the EM \u201cscattering\u201d response of crustal structures is thought to dominate the observed EM\nfields. That is, the scale-length of 3D conductivity anomalies is thought to be small in relation\nto the scale-length of the EM field (e.g. Ritter & Banks 1998; Tauber et al. 2003), and hence the\nscattered electric field should be in phase with the regional field. Therefore, we should be able to\nconsider induction throughout the NESS region without examining how phase shifts distort the\nspatial structure of the EM fields. The central period of 750 s is characteristic of the time-scales of\nvariations of auroral sub-storm electrojets (e.g. Rostoker et al. 1997) which are known to be one\ncause of large GIC (e.g. Viljanen et al. 1999).\nThe main motivation for this study is to understand better the effect of GIC on technological\nsystems. However, in this paper we concentrate on determining the geoelectric field using the\navailable MT and GDS data. Therefore, the bulk of this paper is concerned with investigating\nthe regional scale EM fields associated with the Southern Uplands and Northumberland Trough\nconductivity anomalies. We extend the HEA technique by calculating and displaying on the same\nplot the electric field associated with a unit magnetic induction as well as the anomalous magnetic\nfield. The joint HEA provides a first impression of sites where the electric field is distorted by\nlocal structures. In addition, by comparing the joint HEA analysis before and after MT tensor\ndecomposition the success of MT tensor decomposition in removing the local distortion from the\nMT data can be judged. By considering appropriate rotational invariants of the MT tensor we\ninvestigate the dimensionality of the MT data, and estimate how the electric field magnitude varies\nthroughout the region. We argue that the presence of the Southern Uplands and Northumberland\nTrough conductivity anomalies, and the proximity of the shelf-seas and oceans, will influence GIC\nin the Scottish Power transmission network by altering the magnitude and direction of the regional\nelectric field.\n6 A.J. McKay\n2 DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA\nThe data are drawn from a number of studies connected with investigating the conductivity struc-\nture of northern England and southern Scotland (NESS). The MT data consist of a single period\nband, centred on 750 s, of all four complex elements of the 2\u00d7 2 MT tensor defined by\nE =M \u00b7B (1)\nwhere E and B (following the notation of Weaver et al. 2000) are the horizontal electric and\nmagnetic induction fields. The MT tensors are expressed in geographic co-ordinates, with units\nof mV\/km.nT (which is equivalent to a velocity). They are therefore telluric response functions\n(Hobbs 1992). The impedance (Z) of the Earth in Ohms is defined to be,\nZ = \u00b50\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0 Mxx Mxy\nMyx Myy\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb (2)\nwhere \u00b50 is the permeability of free space (Weaver 1994), and x and y are the geographic north\nand east directions. Throughout this paper we work with the telluric response functions, since\nmagnetic measurements are generally quoted with units of nT, and we refer to M as the MT\ntensor (e.g. Weaver et al. 2000). In the form supplied (Banks, 2002, personal communication),\nerror estimates for each tensor element are available only at 15 of the 58 sites. The MT tensor may\nbe expressed in another reference frame (x\u2032 y\u2032) by rotation i.e. M\u2032 = R\u03b8MRT\u03b8 , where R\u03b8 is the\nmatrix for clockwise rotation by an angle \u03b8 about the positive z-axis, viz.\nR\u03b8 =\n\uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f0 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\uf8f9\uf8fa\uf8fb (3)\nand RT\u03b8 is the transpose of the rotation matrix.\nThe GDS data consist of complex-valued single-station GDS transfer functions (Tx, Ty) which\nlink the vertical and horizontal geomagnetic induction, viz.\nBz = TxBx + TyBy (4)\n(e.g. Banks 1973).\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 7\n2.1 Acquisition and Processing\nThe MT and GDS data are a sub-set of a much larger database, initially compiled by Livelybrooks\net al. (1993) using data acquired by groups at Edinburgh University, the British Geological Survey,\nand Lancaster University, and subsequently supplemented by a number of studies (Junge 1995;\nBanks et al. 1996; Tauber et al. 2003). The studies which contributed the majority of the MT data\nused in this paper are now briefly described; a description of the GDS database may be found in\nBanks et al. (1993).\nBeamish (1986) and Beamish & Smythe (1986) were interested in investigating the deep (30\nkm) crustal structure of the Northumberland Trough (Figure 1). They employed EDA fluxgate\nmagnetometers for the magnetic field measurements, and non-polarising CuSO4 electrodes sepa-\nrated by 100 m for the electric field measurements with a sampling interval of 10 s. The telluric\nresponses were calculated using weighted means of upward and downward biased estimates of\neach of the tensor elements (e.g. Rokityansky 1982, pp. 193\u2013201).\nBanks et al. (1996) attempted to determine the origin of the two main GDS anomalies in NESS\nthought to be linked to the position of the ISZ. They compiled pre-existing Edinburgh University\ndata and added both new Audio and Long period MT sites, mainly in the Northumberland Trough,\nin an effort to optimise a MT profile running from the Midland Valley, through the Southern\nUplands to the Alston Block (see Figure 1). They employed EDA fluxgate magnetometers, ECA\n11 induction coils and lead\/lead chloride electrodes to measure the magnetic induction and electric\nfields. Impedance estimates covering a period range of \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 103 s were derived using the\nrobust processing package of Egbert & Booker (1986).\nSubsequently, Tauber et al. (2003) improved the resolution of the NESS GDS anomalies in the\ndepth range 1-15 km, and assessed the degree to which the improvement in resolution could be\nachieved by optimising all aspects from data collection to final modelling. The main MT profile of\nTauber et al. (2003) was aligned perpendicular to the strike of the principal Caledonian structures\n(55\u25e6); see Figures 1 and 2. Data were acquired with SPAM III systems (Ritter et al. 1998), with\nboth Metronix MFS05 and CM11E induction coils and silver\/silver chloride electrodes to mea-\nsure the magnetic induction and electric fields respectively. The sampling interval was tailored to\n8 A.J. McKay\nthe period range of interest. The \u2018remote reference\u2019 (e.g. Gamble et al. 1979) facility of SPAM\nIII, in which data from a local base and one or more remote sites may be recorded simultane-\nously, was employed to establish profiles parallel to the main profile. The side profiles allowed\nthe consistency of structure along the main profile to be assessed, although it was only possible to\nduplicate part of the main profile (Tauber et al. 2003). Impedance estimates were derived using the\nrobust processing package of Egbert & Booker (1986). The consistency of apparent resistivity and\nphase estimates were checked using the \u03c1+ modelling approach of Parker & Booker (1996) which\nestablished an error floor of 3% for the impedance elements (Tauber et al. 2003).\n3 JOINT ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC HYPOTHETICAL EVENT ANALYSIS\nIf we let x\u02c6 , y\u02c6 be unit vectors in the geographic north and east direction respectively we may\ndefine the telluric vectors, ex and ey, as the electric field associated with a unit magnetic induction\nlinearly polarised in a north and east direction respectively, viz.\nex =Mxxx\u02c6+Myxy\u02c6 and ey =Mxyx\u02c6+Myyy\u02c6 (5)\n(Bahr 1988).\nTelluric vectors provide a convenient way to display the MT tensor. Both a real and imaginary\ntelluric vector may be shown graphically. The real part of the telluric vector corresponds to the\nelectric field in phase with the magnetic induction field; the imaginary part is out of phase with\nthe magnetic induction field (Bahr 1988). The telluric vectors may be calculated and displayed\nin similar way to the Hypothetical Event Analysis (HEA) technique commonly employed in the\ndisplay and interpretation of GDS anomalies (e.g. Banks et al. 1993; Egbert & Booker 1993).\nFigure 3 is a hypothetical event map of the real part of the anomalous horizontal magnetic in-\nduction field and telluric vectors associated with a unit magnetic induction (1 nT) linearly polarised\nin a northerly direction (0\u25e6) at a period of 750 s. A westerly regional electric field is implied by\nthe polarisation of the magnetic induction field used here. The anomalous horizontal magnetic in-\nduction fields were computed from single-station geomagnetic transfer functions using the method\ndescribed by Banks et al. (1993).\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 9\nThe anomalous horizontal magnetic fields highlight the presence of the two main conductivity\nanomalies in the region (e.g. Banks et al. 1983; Tauber et al. 2003). The first strikes south-west to\nnorth-east, just south of the Southern Uplands fault (SUF); the other strikes east-west and is sand-\nwiched between the Northumberland Trough and Alston Block. These anomalies correlate closely\nwith both major structural features, such as the SUF which divides the Midland Valley terrane from\nthat of the Southern Uplands, and the results of other geophysical techniques (e.g. gravity) (Banks\net al. 1996). Both anomalies are thought to originate from a region of high conductivity in the\nmiddle-crust (Banks et al. 1996; Tauber et al. 2003). While the anomalies appear continuous, the\nhigh-resolution study of Tauber et al. (2003) resolved the south-west end of the SUF conductors\ninto two distinct blocks with edges which mapped to faults expressed in the surface geology.\nSome of the difficulties associated with interpretation of the raw MT tensor data are obvious.\nThere are responses which do not appear compatible with neighbouring sites which is manifested\nas large angular deviations of the telluric vectors from the regional east-west direction, and large\namplitude responses. A clear example is provided by the two sites (C1 & C2) at the northern end\nof Profile C: neither the amplitude nor azimuth of the telluric vectors appear consistent. Similarly,\nthe telluric vectors at two sites (A7 & A9) near the southern end of profile A (Central Scotland) are\nalmost orthogonal, and straddle a similarly sized telluric vector (A8) which is parallel to the strike\nof the conductivity contrast implied by contours of the anomalous magnetic field. Worth noting\nhowever, is the strong but spatially consistent deviation from the regional east-west direction ex-\nhibited by the five sites just north of sites A7-A9. The site spacing of profiles A and C are \u223c 5 km\nand \u223c 2\u2212 3 km respectively (Junge 1995; Tauber et al. 2003). At the period considered here (750\ns) the inductive scale length is likely to exceed tens of km. Thus, it is reasonable to expect some\ndegree of consistency between sites. These examples indicate that there appear to be both regional\nand local distortions of the electric field.\nIn some cases, the magnitude and azimuth of the telluric vectors is inconsistent with the con-\nfiguration of conductive material implied by the map of the anomalous magnetic induction; Profile\nB (Northumberland Trough) provides an example. At sites within the 0.1 nT contour (B3-B5) we\nmay have anticipated telluric vectors with a smaller magnitude than the two sites (B1 & B2) which\n10 A.J. McKay\nlie close to the conductivity low implied by the closed 0 nT contour. The opposite is observed: tel-\nluric vectors within the region of high conductivity are generally much larger in comparison to\nsites outwith the region.\n4 GEOELECTRIC DIMENSIONALITY OF THE REGION\nRotational invariants of the MT tensor provide some of the most compact parameters embodying\nthe information contained in the MT tensor, and those which characterise the dimensionality of\nthe MT tensor are particularly useful. Weaver et al. (2000) (hereafter WAL) set out criteria for\nclassifying the dimensionality and distortion which are based on seven independent rotational\ninvariants. Similarly, Bahr (1991) proposed a method to assign the MT tensor to one of seven\ndifferent model classes.\nThe method of WAL employs rotational invariants of the MT tensor which are zero for particu-\nlar dimensionality models. The WAL invariants are closely linked to the Mohr circle representation\nof MT data (e.g. Lilley 1993). The first two invariants, I1 and I2, are based on Lilley\u2019s \u201ccentral\nimpedances\u201d which are defined as\nI1 =\n1\n2\n[\n(<Mxx + <Myy)2 + (<Mxy \u2212<Myx)2\n] 1\n2 (6)\nI2 =\n1\n2\n[\n(=Mxx + =Myy)2 + (=Mxy \u2212=Myx)2\n] 1\n2 (7)\nwhere < and = are respectively the real and imaginary parts of the complex tensor element. These\ntwo invariants are computed from all the elements of the MT tensor, and when the conductivity\nstructure is 1D the apparent resistivity and phase parameters may be calculated easily. The invari-\nants I3 and I4 express the two-dimensionality of the structure, and vanish if the structure is 1D.\nThey arise from the necessary condition of two-dimensionality that there should exist a rotation\nangle (\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2032; see eqn. 3) for which the diagonal elements of the MT tensor vanish. I5 and I6 are\nrelated to galvanic distortion of the electric field. They arise from the condition that in regional co-\nordinates the column elements of the MT tensor share the same phase. In other words the telluric\nvectors each have a single well-defined phase. When I5 is defined but all higher order invariants\nare not, then this indicates a pure twist, without shear, of the electric field. If I6 is defined, the MT\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 11\ntensor may be decomposed by rotation and real distortion into a regional 2D tensor. In a regional\n3D setting there exists no single rotation angle to equalise the phase of each element in the first\nand second columns of the MT tensor, and I7 is non-zero. In practice, using real data with noise,\nthe invariants are never zero and a non-zero threshold value, above which the invariants are con-\nsidered non-zero, must be employed. WAL demonstrated that a threshold of 0.1 was acceptable for\nrealistic numerical data subject to 2% Gaussian noise. Mart\u0131\u00b4 et al. (2004) developed error propaga-\ntion formulae, and found a threshold value of between 0.1-0.15 for data with errors which ranged\nfrom 1% at the shortest periods to 30% at the longest periods. We used the threshold originally\nsuggested by WAL of 0.1, and did not explicitly account for data errors.\nWe proceeded to classify systematically the MT tensors at each site (Figure 1) using the WAL\nscheme. 27% of the data were difficult to classify confidently. For example, in a number of cases\nthe invariants I6 and I7 were contradictory: I6 would fall well below the threshold required for\nthe interpretation in terms of 3D galvanic distortion of a 2D region, but I7 would be well-defined\nsuggesting the influence of 3D structure. Alternatively, in some cases the invariants would fall\non, or very close to, the threshold. Therefore, for comparison, the dimensionality of the data was\ninvestigated using Bahr\u2019s distortion classes. Again, some sites proved difficult to classify, but there\nwas not always a one to one correspondence between problematic sites in each of the WAL and\nBahr schemes. The results of the analysis are shown in Figure 4.\nWe consider first the dimensionality as determined using the WAL criteria. Figure 4 shows that\nalmost half of the data are 3D; the other half may mostly be described in terms of some form of\ngalvanic distortion. The galvanic distortion is mostly a 3D distortion of an underlying 2D region.\nHowever, there are a number of sites where distortion of the data could be due simply to electrode\nmisalignment, which results in a pure twist of the electric field (Weaver et al. 2000). Fewer data\nare classified as 3D using the Bahr scheme; for almost 70% of the data a galvanic distortion model\nmay be appropriate. In contrast to the WAL scheme there are 5 sites where the data appear to be\n2D. However, these sites were difficult to classify; Bahr\u2019s second class, that of a purely local 3D\nanomaly, may also be appropriate. However, in each of these cases the particular dimensionality\nclass is not well defined.\n12 A.J. McKay\nThe dimensionality class obtained using the WAL and Bahr criteria compare well: 40 out of the\n58 (\u223c 69%) sites fall into a comparable dimensionality class. In undertaking the analysis we chose\nthe minimum value for each of the thresholds suggested by WAL and Bahr. Mart\u0131\u00b4 et al. (2004)\ninvestigated a range of threshold values to find the most stable dimensionality parameters, and a\nsimilar strategy could perhaps be used to optimise agreement between the WAL and Bahr schemes,\nand find a minimum threshold which provides the most consistent interpretation of the geoelectric\ndimensionality. However, we chose not to do this as we attempt to fit a galvanic distortion model\nto the data which takes account of data errors. At almost all of the sites where we found difficulties\nclassifying the dimensionality using the WAL scheme the choice was either between a 3D or 3D\ndistortion of a 2D region. However, at these sites the Bahr skew is invariably less than 0.3, which\nis below the cut-off threshold suggested by Bahr above which the data should be considered 3D.\nThe Bahr skew performs the same function, and is similar in functional form, to the WAL invariant\nI7 but at least for this data-set appears to be less sensitive to noisy data.\nMohr circles were found to be useful to interpret cases where the WAL parameters appear\nto contradict each other e.g. I6 is small but I7 is defined. For example, the Real and Imaginary\nMohr circles for the Galloway site C11, which is within the MSZ, are shown in Figure 5. The\nMohr circles suggest that the dimensionality of site C11 is likely to be 3D since the centre of both\ncircles is displaced significantly from the Mxy\u2032 axis (e.g. Lilley 1993). However, the centre of both\ncircles is nearly co-incident, as are the radial arms which join the centre of the circles to the origin.\nTherefore, the difference of the angles between the Real and Imaginary radial arms and the Mxy\u2032\naxis is small. The sine of the angular difference is precisely what the invariant I6 measures. Where\nthe WAL parameters lay close to, or on, the threshold values, the Mohr circles were less useful\nsince a choice has to be made regarding the cut-off threshold above which the parameters of the\nWAL analysis are considered defined.\nThe results of the WAL, Bahr and Mohr circle analysis highlight the usefulness of considering\nmore than one approach to investigate the dimensionality of MT data. While it may be tempting to\nre-classify some of the WAL sites, on the basis of, say, the Bahr distortion analysis, we note that\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 13\nnumerical studies have shown that a MT tensor obtained over a 3D conductivity structure can give\nBahr skew values below the threshold (Ledo et al. 2002b).\n5 DECOMPOSITION OF THE MT TENSORS\nTo form a picture of the spatial variation of the electric fields and currents throughout the region\nwe attempted to separate those distortions of the electric field which are local in nature from the\nunderlying regional response. The joint HEA and dimensionality analysis suggests that most sites\nare either subject to varying degrees of galvanic distortion or sample 3D structure. Therefore we\nattempted to fit a galvanic distortion model to the MT tensors taking account of the data errors. It\nis assumed that magnetic distortion is negligible, and that the measured MT tensor takes the form:\nMm ' D \u00b7Mr (8)\nwhere Mm is the measured MT tensor, D is the telluric distortion matrix which is real and fre-\nquency independent, andMr is the regional MT tensor which is assumed to be 2D (e.g. Bahr 1988;\nGroom & Bailey 1989; Smith 1995).\nIn the tensor decomposition method of Smith (1995) the regional strike direction is determined\nby examining the misfit of the distortion model (eq. 8) as a function of tensor rotation angle. In\norder that simple analytical expressions for the distortion parameters may be employed, indepen-\ndence of the data errors was assumed, which should be approximately true (Smith 1995) when the\nimpedances have been determined using a robust technique (e.g. Egbert & Booker 1986).\n5.1 Multi-site Analysis\nInitially, we assumed that all sites share the same regional 2D structure we aim to recover which\nis the same assumption made by the sophisticated multi-site analysis of McNeice & Jones (2001).\nThus, at each tentative strike angle the distortion model is fitted to the MT data, the misfit com-\nputed, and summed over all sites (e.g. Tauber et al. 2003). Assuming an acceptable fit can be\nestablished, the strike is the angle at which the misfit is minimised (Smith 1995).\nFigure 6 shows the dependence of the total chi-squared misfit (\u03c72) on the angle (degrees east\n14 A.J. McKay\nof north) through which the MT tensors were rotated. It can be seen that the misfit changes sys-\ntematically with rotation, and that a \u2018strike\u2019 direction of 58\u25e6 is suggested. However, the direction\nhas an ambiguity of 90\u25e6; without additional information we cannot say that this corresponds to\n\u2018true\u2019 electrical strike which is defined by the E-polarisation mode of a 2D conductor. The sug-\ngested direction agrees reasonably well with the assumed strike of the major tectonic features of\nthe region of 52\u25e6(Tauber et al. 2003), but the fit of the model is poor: the total number of degrees\nof freedom (\u03bd) is 115 (58 sites each associated with four complex MT tensor elements and 6 fitted\nparameters, and one strike angle therefore \u03bd = 58 \u00d7 (8 \u2212 6) \u2212 1), and for the fit to be deemed\nacceptable, at the 95% confidence level, log10 \u03c72 should be less than \u223c 2. Given the poor fit of the\ndistortion model when we consider the sites as a single data set, the single-site approach is now\nexamined.\n5.2 Single-site Analysis\nWhen the strike angle was determined independently at each site, the fit of the distortion model\nwas found to be acceptable at 34 of the 58 sites; see Figure 7. Both the sense of the strike angle is\nindicated (strike is parallel to the side-bars), and whether the fit of the distortion model is accept-\nable at the 95% confidence level (\u03c72 < 3.8; filled circles). At each of the 34 sites a range of strike\nangles was found to produce an acceptable fit to the distortion model. The strike angles were well\nconstrained (range of acceptable values limited to within \u00b110\u25e6) at approximately 75% of these\nsites. At two sites, all strike angles were found to provide a statistically acceptable fit which may\nindicate that the data errors have been overestimated. Regardless, the misfit did display a clear\nminimum consistent with surrounding sites.\nFor tensor decomposition to be judged successful, the strike direction obtained at each site\nmust be regionally consistent. Indeed, at sites where the fit of the distortion model is acceptable,\nthe determined strike angle is generally consistent with neighbouring sites e.g. the seven sites at\nthe southern end of Profile A (Central Scotland), where the strike angle is \u223c 60\u25e6 \u2212 70\u25e6. However,\nthere are some sites where the strike appears consistent with neighbouring sites, but the fit of the\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 15\nmodel is poor e.g. the single site on the east coast near the southern end of Profile A; see also the\ndetailed map of the Profile C (Galloway) sites for more examples.\nA change of strike angle is suggested as we move south along Profile B (Northumberland\nTrough). The strike of the first two sites is 60\u25e6 \u2212 65\u25e6 (although the fit of the first site is poor with\n\u03c72 = 29); the strike of southern sites is \u223c 80\u25e6. The strike of the southern sites is close to, but less\nthan, the east-west strike suggested by the HEA anomaly map; see Figure 3. For a similar profile,\nBanks et al. (1996) found a similar dependence of the strike angle using the tensor decomposition\nmethod of Groom & Bailey (1989). In addition, the major geological features rotate from 45\u25e6 in\nthe south western portion of the Southern Uplands to as much as 90\u25e6 in the vicinity of the Stublick\nFault (e.g. Banks et al. 1996). A change in strike angle is also suggested as we move south along\nProfile C (Galloway). However, the sense of the change is different from that of Profile B. The\nstrike of sites north of the MSZ (the two sites at the northern end of Profile C aside) is \u223c 85\u25e6; the\nstrike of sites south of the MSZ is closer to \u223c 55\u25e6. The latter strike direction is closer to both the\nregional tectonic trends and \u2018surface\u2019 geology (Tauber et al. 2003). Thus, the strikes of these sites\nare taken to be more reliable.\n5.3 Comparison with dimensionality\nAt sites where either the Bahr or WAL invariant analysis suggest the MT tensors are 3D we would\nexpect the fit of the distortion model to be poor. In the Central Scotland profile (A) there are only\ntwo sites where the distortion model is found to be inappropriate. For these two sites the WAL\nand Bahr analysis is contradictory; the WAL analysis suggests that the sites are influenced by 3D\nstructure, but the Bahr analysis suggests that site A3 is subject to weak distortion and that site LL\nis 2D. Similarly, there are two sites within the Northumberland Trough profile (B) where the fit\nof the distortion model is found to be poor, and the WAL and Bahr analysis is contradictory. At\nsites in the Galloway survey where the fit of the distortion model is poor both the WAL and Bahr\nanalysis suggests that the poor fit is due to the influence of 3D structure. In these cases the Bahr\nanalysis performs slightly better than the WAL analysis as it seems to reflect better the spatial\n16 A.J. McKay\nvariation of the model fit, particularly at the southern end of the main profile where the influence\nof 3D structure and galvanic distortion alternates as we move along the profile.\n6 THE REGIONAL RESPONSE\nAt sites where the fit of the distortion model was found to be acceptable the regional responses\n(Mr; eq. 8) were recovered. The strike angle found at each site was used to define the regional co-\nordinate system of the MT tensor. After recovery of the regional response, the regional MT tensors\nwere rotated back to geographic coordinates to display the results in the form of telluric vectors.\nThe real ex telluric vectors after the decomposition procedure are shown in Figure 8. In compari-\nson with Figure 3, the decomposition has generated considerable inter-site consistency in telluric\nvector azimuth: the large angular deviations of the telluric vector from the regional azimuth noted\npreviously have vanished. The telluric vectors are now generally consistent with those expected for\nthe polarisation azimuth of the primary magnetic induction, and the configuration of conductive\nmaterial suggested by the spatial pattern of the anomalous horizontal magnetic induction.\nWe would like to estimate an \u2018average\u2019 electric field associated with a unit geomagnetic dis-\nturbance. However, an inherent limitation of the tensor decomposition schemes is that without\nadditional information the extent to which the regional electric field is \u2018amplified\u2019 via galvanic\ndistortion is indeterminate. There are a number of strategies for overcoming this. For example, the\nstatic shift parameter, which describes the effect of this amplification of the electric field on the ap-\nparent resistivity, can be solved for using a joint inversion of MT and GDS data (e.g. Livelybrooks\net al. 1993). In the special case where the spatial derivative of the horizontal magnetic field may\nbe neglected, Ledo et al. (2002a) show how GDS functions may be used to remove the static-shift\nand partially recover the regional E-polarisation response. Here we use a simple approach since\nwe need only remove those sites which distort significantly our estimate of an average regional\nelectric field.\nFor each of the profiles shown in Figure 1 Lilley\u2019s central impedances were used to calculate a\nrotationally invariant measure of the telluric response which we call the central telluric response.\nError estimates were calculated using the formulae given by Mart\u0131\u00b4 et al. (2004) which were derived\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 17\nusing classical error propagation. The central telluric response is shown for each of the three pro-\nfiles (Figure 1) in Figure 9. Each profile strikes approximately north west to south east. Distance,\nin km, is measured relative to the first site at the northern end of each profile; the position of major\ngeological features are marked.\nThe main features traversed by Profile A are the Highland Boundary Fault (HBF) in the north\nwest and the Southern Uplands Fault (SUF) in the south east (e.g. McKerrow 1986). Immedi-\nately south of the SUF are negative Bouguer gravity anomalies thought to be produced by granite\nbatholiths (Lagios & Hipkin 1982; Banks et al. 1996). The main feature traversed by Profile B is\nthe Stublick Fault (SF) which marks the boundary between the Northumberland Trough and Al-\nston Block. Profile C encompasses the tectonic terrane of the Southern Uplands and the Moniaive\nShear Zone (MSZ), a ductile shear zone approximately 5 km wide. It also crosses numerous tract\nbounding faults (Tauber et al. 2003); see Figure 2.\nSome spatial consistency of the effective telluric response is observed within profiles A and C,\nand the similar shape of profiles A and C is interesting. Profile A is bounded by the major tectonic\nterranes of the Central Highlands and Southern Uplands to the north and south respectively. Profile\nC lies entirely within the tectonic terrane of the Southern Uplands: the northern end of profile C is\n\u223c 5 km from the SUF (Tauber et al. 2003). Profile B appears less consistent, but the strike is less\nwell-defined and the station spacing is larger than the other two profiles.\nTwo minima in the Profile C telluric response occur on either side of the MSZ. These minima\nare coincident with zones of high electrical conductivity (\u223c 4\u2212 12 km depth) identified in Tauber\net al.\u2019s (2003) B-polarisation phase pseudo section, and best fitting 2D model derived from invert-\ning the B-polarisation mode MT data; the relative high within the MSZ coincides with a zone of\nlower conductivity over the same depth range, the origin of which is uncertain (see Tauber et al.\n2003, for further details). Tauber et al. (2003) also commented on the influence of major structural\nfeatures beyond the ends of the profile: the results of the inversion show a deepening of the conduc-\ntive layer to the north, under the Midland valley, and a conductive zone (depth \u2265 12 km) beneath\nthe southern end. However, given the poor control provided by single sites situated at each end of\nthe profile, and the need to satisfy the 2D model boundary conditions, they judged the features to\n18 A.J. McKay\nbe insufficiently robust to warrant further discussion. At the northern end of profile C the real part\nof the central telluric response rises smoothly (over a distance of 10 km) from \u223c 0.25 mV\/km.nT\nto \u223c 3 mV\/km.nT, as the SUF is approached. Similarly, at the southern end of profile A, the real\npart of the central telluric response rises smoothly from \u223c 0.5 mV\/km.nT to \u223c 2.25 mV\/km.nT\nover a similar distance as the SUF is approached. The magnitude and spatial variation of the real\nand imaginary central telluric response at sites near the south east end of profile A is similar to\nthat of sites at the north western end of profile C. If we displaced profile C approximately 100\nkm to the north east, along the strike of the SUF, then the ends of profiles A and C would match\nrather well across their common boundary of the SUF. Thus the steep rise in the modulus of the\ntelluric response at each end of the profile may reflect the proximity to the major tectonic terrane\nboundary.\nThe spatial variation of the central telluric response is consistent with the Southern Uplands\nbeing generally more conductive than the Midland Valley to its north. We can use the magnitude\nof the telluric response to estimate the size of the electric fields. At distances greater than \u223c 10\nkm from the major tectonic boundaries, the magnitude of the effective telluric response of sites\nwithin the Midland Valley is approximately double that of sites within the tectonic terrane of the\nSouthern Uplands.\n7 DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS\nThe joint Hypothetical Event Analysis highlighted the disparity between the spatial distribution\nof induced currents implied by the GDS and MT data. To obtain a regionally consistent picture\nof the geometry of induced electric fields we used the tensor decomposition method of Smith\n(1995). The tensor decomposition was justified because the dimensionality and distortion analysis\nindicated that the data from most sites are affected by varying degrees of galvanic distortion,\nwhile some are likely to be affected by 3D structure. The majority of sites for which 3D structure\nis implied are located south of the Moniaive Shear Zone (Profile C, Galloway) which is consistent\nwith the findings of Tauber et al. (2003) where out-of-quadrant phases and a change in the azimuth\nof induction arrows were both observed. A multi- and single-site approach to the determination of\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 19\nelectrical strike was undertaken. While the multi-site analysis suggested a regional strike direction\nof 58\u25e6, which is in good agreement with the trends of the major regional structure, the fit of\nthe distortion model was poor, and was rejected at the 95% confidence level. Using a single-site\napproach, the fit of the distortion model was acceptable at the 95% confidence level for 34 of the 58\nsites considered. The strike directions we determined were found to be generally consistent with\nthe electromagnetic strike implied by the GDS anomalies i.e. approximately 60\u25e6 in the vicinity\nof the Southern Uplands, and about 80\u25e6 \u2212 90\u25e6 in the vicinity of the Northumberland Trough.\nRecovering the regional MT response from the decomposed tensors reconciled the spatial structure\nof the electromagnetic fields implied by the GDS and MT data.\nWe found it useful to consider more than one approach to investigate the dimensionality of\nthe MT data. It was not a goal of this study to compare the WAL and Bahr analysis. Generally\napplicable conclusions cannot be drawn as we chose the minimum thresholds without explicitly\nconsidering data noise. However, the MT data we used are a good test of the various techniques\nwe employed since they span a period of time in which the processing of MT data has advanced\nconsiderably. Weaver et al. (2000) highlight that the invariant I7 is sensitive to noise while each\nof the six other invariants (and the supplementary invariant Q) are robust. We note that for many\nof the sites where the seventh WAL invariant fell on or very close to the cut-off threshold, and we\nhave assumed a 3D distortion of a 2D region, the Bahr skew was generally small and a statistically\nacceptable fit of the decomposition could be established. Mart\u0131\u00b4 et al. (2005) illustrated that the\nWAL Q parameter may improve Bahr\u2019s analysis; we think that it may be useful to supplement the\nWAL analysis with Bahr\u2019s skew. However, this study provides evidence based on measured data\nwhich supplements the numerical modelling results of Ledo et al. (2002b) which show that a small\nBahr skew is a necessary, but not sufficient condition, for the dimensionality of the MT tensor to\nbe less than 3D. For example, similar Mohr circles are obtained to those shown in Figure 5 for two\nGalloway sites 52 and 53 (see Figure 2). These Mohr circles and the WAL analysis suggest a 3D\ndimensionality, and the decomposition model can be rejected at the 95% confidence level, but the\nBahr skew is small.\nOur main motivation for calculating an effective telluric response using Lilley\u2019s central impedances\n20 A.J. McKay\nwas that they are compact, and are calculated using all of the elements of the MT tensor. In addi-\ntion, invariant responses have in some special cases been shown to provide an element of distortion\ncorrection (e.g. Berdichevsky et al. 1989). Some have argued (e.g. Groom & Bailey 1989), and oth-\ners demonstrated by modelling (e.g. Jiracek 1990, and references therein), that the effective telluric\nresponse may still only represent the regional telluric response up to an unknown static shift factor.\nIf we wished to use the MT data to extract a conductivity model of the Earth, then this unknown\nscaling factor would be problem. Here however, we need only an estimate of the total electric field,\nand because spatially consistent sets of the effective telluric response were obtained for profiles A\n(Central Scotland) and C (Galloway) we can use these as representative of the magnitude of the\ntotal electric field of each of the areas traversed. We found that within the Galloway profile, low\n(0.25 mV\/km.nT) effective telluric responses correlated closely with two zones of high electrical\nconductivity in the depth range 4-12 km which are thought to be the source of the SUF anomaly\n(Tauber et al. 2003); within the Midland Valley the effective telluric response is 0.5 mV\/km.nT.\nThe effective telluric responses are relatively smooth along the Midland Valley and Southern Up-\nlands profiles. These profiles suggest that the regional electric fields in the Midland Valley are\napproximately double those in the Southern Uplands. However, some care is required closer to the\nboundaries of these two regions: the similarity between the central telluric response of sites at the\nsouth eastern and north western end of profiles A and C respectively suggests that the effective\ntelluric response may be larger (\u223c 1\u2212 3 mV\/km.nT) about 10 km either side of the SUF.\nTo turn estimates of the effective telluric response into useful estimates of the geoelectric field\nwe need to know the typical amplitude of magnetic variations at a period of 750 s. Pulkkinen et al.\n(2003) considered in detail a large geomagnetic storm which occurred in April 2000 and caused\nGIC in both Finland and the United Kingdom. Some of the largest GIC during this storm were\nobserved during an intense Westward Electrojet. Inspection of the magnetograms from Eskdale-\nmuir geomagnetic observatory suggests that the north component of the geomagnetic field varied\nby approximately 800 nT over a period of about 10 minutes (McKay 2004). Therefore, electric\nfield amplitudes in the Midland Valley and Southern Uplands were likely to be around 0.4 V\/km\nand 0.2 V\/km respectively; within 10 km either side of a major boundary such as the SUF then\nThe electric field in northern England and southern Scotland 21\nthe electric field amplitude could reach 2.4 V\/ km. The magnitude of the electric field at any given\nperiod is one factor which will control the amplitude of GIC: the spatial geometry of the fields\nwill also influence the distribution of GIC. Indeed, the hypothetical event analysis shows that the\ndirection of the induced geoelectric field deviates from the regional east-west direction when the\ngeomagnetic induction is polarised north. In particular, electric field vectors in the Southern Up-\nlands region point along the axis of the Southern Uplands anomaly which strikes north-east to\nsouth-west.\nOne of the aims of this study was to develop an understanding of the regional EM fields which\njustified the approach we took to reconcile the MT and GDS data. However, it is not clear how\nlocal distortion of the electric field will affect GIC. The voltage between two ends of a conductor\nsuch as a power line is equal to the line integral of the electric field along the path of the conduc-\ntor (e.g. Gomez-Trevino 1992; Viljanen & Pirjola 1994). Therefore, in GIC studies, it is usually\nassumed that variations of the electric field which occur on a small spatial scale are unimportant\nbecause integration smoothes the electric field, and the conductors in a power network are long\n(e.g. Viljanen & Pirjola 1994). However, this smoothing operation requires that the small-scale\nelectric field can be characterised as random noise (e.g. Viljanen & Pirjola 1994). It is not self-\nevident that the spatial variability of the electric field in the NESS region may be described as\nrandom. In addition, the extent to which the smoothing property is satisfied will be guided by both\nthe spatial-scales of the power network (i.e. the typical length of connections in the network) and\nthe electric field. Both require further study before firm conclusions can be drawn.\nThe coast effect, where the on-shore electric field magnitude is enhanced because of the mis-\nmatch in the conductivities of the ocean and land is considered important for GIC (e.g. Beamish\net al. 2002). For example, power generation plant is often located close to the coast to simplify\ncooling arrangements (e.g. Gilbert 2005). The southern sites of Profile A are interesting: these sites\npresumably sense the EM fields associated with both the SUF anomaly and the coastal conductiv-\nity contrast. The amplitude of the three most easterly telluric vectors is enhanced in comparison\nto the inland sites (A4-A9) which suggests that the coastal effect contributes to the response; see\nFigures 1 and 8. The azimuth of the telluric vectors is less revealing because it is consistent with\n22 A.J. McKay\nboth the strike of the SUF, and the strike of the coastline. Both the coastal conductivity contrast\nand the SUF will impart the same sense of rotation on the regional current flow e.g. a regional east\nwest current will be deflected to the south west.\nThis particular study provides a snapshot of the electromagnetic fields at a period of 750 s for\na given polarisation azimuth and phase of the primary magnetic induction. In future, we intend to\nextend the period range to both longer and shorter periods. The largest GIC are often associated\nwith rapid variations of the geomagnetic field (e.g. Viljanen 1997), but to gain a full understanding\nof the risk posed to power networks we also need to investigate longer period variations, such as\nsubstorm expansion, which can last for about 30 minutes and affect a wide geographic area (e.g.\nPulkkinen et al. 2003). Increasing the period range is probably best done using a combination of the\ndata-based investigation as was employed here in tandem with a numerical model (e.g. Thomson\net al. 2005). Indeed if we are to be able to calculate GIC then we would need to \u2018interpolate\u2019 the\nsparse MT measurements in some fashion. It is worth investigating whether the HEA map can be\nused for the purpose of interpolation. Throughout this paper we have made the implicit assumption\nthat the primary magnetic induction is uniform across our study area. While this assumption is\nmost likely a fair approximation when the field is quiescent it is unlikely to be true during a major\ngeomagnetic disturbance. Nevertheless, we still can gain an understanding of the dimensionality\nof models we need to employ to understand and model the electric field response.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe research described in this paper was supported by Engineering and Physical Sciences Re-\nsearch Council award number 99316793.
