These have been assayed against the parasitic protozoan \nenzyme LmjIPCS. These studies showed that whilst the C-3 hydroxyl group was not essential for \nturnover it provided enhanced affinity. Reflecting the membrane bound nature of the enzyme a long (C13) \nhydrocarbon ceramide tail was necessary for both high affinity and turnover. Whilst the N-acyl chain also \ncontributed to affinity, analogues lacking the amide linkage functioned as competitive inhibitors in both \nenzyme and cell-based assays. A model that accounts for this observation is proposed.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nProtozoan parasites of the order Trypanosomatidae cause a range of human diseases, including the \nleishmaniases and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT).1-3 These infections are of increasing \nprevalence, particularly in developing countries, and have been classified by the World Health \nOrganisation as Category I: emerging or uncontrolled diseases.3 Moreover the spread and severity of \nleishmaniasis is exacerbated by its status as an important co-infection of AIDS patients and the overlap \nin prevalence of HIV and Leishmania spp.4 The treatment of trypanosomatid infections is difficult with the \nmost serious visceral form of leishmaniasis often requiring a long and costly course of drug therapy. The \nchallenge presented by these disease states is heightened by the fact that the few efficacious drugs \navailable often exhibit serious, potentially fatal, side-effects. Moreover, reports of resistance to even the \nPage 2 of 19 \n \nnewer drugs are emerging.5, 6 This situation renders the discovery and validation of new therapeutic \ntargets a priority in these organisms.  \n \nSphingolipids are essential components of eukaryotic cell membranes having critical roles in a variety of \ncell processes including signal transduction, intracellular membrane trafficking and the regulation of cell \ngrowth and survival.7-10 The de novo biosynthesis of these lipid species is initiated by the condensation \nof palmitoyl CoA 1 with L-serine via the ubiquitous eukaryotic enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) \nto produce 3-ketosphinganine which is then reduced to dihydrosphingosine 2. Subsequently, there is \nevolutionary divergence in the pathway. In mammals, dihydrosphingosine is acylated to produce \ndihydroceramide which is then desaturated to ceramide 3, a key bioactive molecule. In contrast, fungi \nand plants first generate hydroxylated sphinganine before acylation to form phytoceramide 4, Figure 1.11, \n12 Like mammals Leishmania spp. also predominantly synthesise ceramide.13 Beyond this point in the \nbiosynthetic pathway a further dichotomy emerges in the synthesis of the predominant \nphosphosphingolipids (PSLs). Utilising sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) mammalian cells transfer \nphosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to ceramide to give sphingomyelin 5.14 In contrast, but \nlike fungi and plants, Leishmania spp. (and other trypanosomatids) synthesise inositol \nphosphorylceramide (IPC) 6 as their primary PSL. One notable difference is that in trypanosomatids the \nIPC formed is that derived from ceramide 3 whereas in plants and fungi the dominant SL used is \nphytoceramide 4 leading to the formation of IPC 7. Whilst the essential fungal enzyme catalysing this \nreaction, AUR1p or IPC synthase (IPCS), has long been characterised as a novel target for anti-\nfungals,12, 15 until recently, the trypanosomatid (and plant)16 orthologues of this protein remained \nunknown. However, using complementation strategy we have isolated the gene encoding IPCS in L. \nmajor (LmjIPCS).17 Moreover, closely related orthologues are apparent in the genome sequence \ndatabases of the other parasitic trypanosomatids, Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei.17-19  \n \nIPCS catalyses the transfer of the phosphorylinositol group from phosphatidylinositol (PI) to ceramide or \nphytoceramide with the concomitant release of diacylglycerol (DAG). Consequently, in addition to \nproducing the major PSL this reaction is also important in maintaining homeostasis in the levels of the \nkey signaling components ceramide and DAG. Since the former is pro-apoptotic and the latter \nmitogenic,20 modulating the activity of this enzyme can have catastrophic effects on cell architecture and \nfunction. Reflecting this the Trypanosoma brucei orthologue has recently been shown to be essential for \nthe pathogenic bloodstream form stage of the lifecycle.18, 19 Given the global impact of these diseases, \nfurther study of these putative protozoan drug targets is essential. Like all other PSL synthases, \nLmjIPCS is an integral membrane protein with six predicted transmembrane spanning domains.19 This \nmakes structure-function studies using protein crystallisation or spectroscopy a significant challenge. In \naddition, whilst similarities with related enzymes, notably the lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs),14, 17, \n21, 22 have enabled the identification of a conserved active site triad incorporating two histidines and one \nPage 3 of 19 \n \naspartate residue,17 the substrate binding sites have not been identified. Consequently, we have initiated \na chemical biology approach to explore the enzyme with the aim of developing a model of the active site \nthat may ultimately inform the design of effective inhibitors. To this end we have established a microtitre \nplate-based assay and delineated the kinetic parameters and mode of action of LmjIPCS.23 These \nstudies revealed that the enzyme follows a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism and that, of the two substrates, \nceramide has a higher affinity for the enzyme than does PI. This observation, combined with the fact that \nPI is a relatively abundant substrate in most membraneous environments, suggested that ceramide is \nthe rate-limiting substrate in the in situ IPCS reaction. On this basis we opted to explore the binding of \nthis substrate to LmjIPCS and in this report we describe the synthesis and evaluation of a set of \nceramide analogues. \n \nPage 4 of 19 \n \nC13H27 SCoA\nO\nC13H27\nOH\nOH\nNH2\nC13H27\nOH\nOH\nNH\nC13H27\nOH\nOH\nHNR\nO\nOH R'\nO\npalmitoyl CoA 1\ndihydrosphingosine 2\nphytoceramide 4ceramide 3\nC13H27\nOH\nO\nNHR\nO\nP\nO\nO\nO-\nNMe3\nC13H27\nOH\nO\nNHR\nO\nP\nO\nO\nO-\nOH\nOH\nOH\nHO OH\nC13H27\nOH\nO\nHN\nP\nO\nO\nO-\nOH\nOH\nOH\nHO OH\nO\nR'OH\nmammals\nSMS + PC\ntrypanosomatids\nIPCS  + PI\nplants\n&\nfungi\nIPCS\n+ PI\ni.

Moreover we have previously demonstrated that, \nwhilst N-acetyl sphingosine 8 was an acceptable substrate for LmjIPCS, sphingosine 9 was not and \nfunctioned as a competitive inhibitor.23 Consequently, all the structures initially targeted as potential \nsubstrate probes retained an amide linkage. With this requirement we opted to explore the length and \nsubstitution in the sphingosine tail, stereochemistry and, more drastically, the presence of the C-1 and C-\n3 hydroxy groups, Figure 2. \n \n \nOH\nOH\nNHR2\nO\nR1\n( )n\nDifferent acyl groups\nDifferent chain length\nDifferent spacing\nRequirement for 3-OH group\nRequirement for 1-OH group\nC13H27\nOH\nOH\nNHH3C\nO\nC13H27\nOH\nOH\nNH2\n8 9\n \nFigure 2: The selected structural features of the ceramide molecule \n \nWhilst many different routes to substituted sphingolipids have been reported, including asymmetric \nstrategies,24-45 we sought routes that would minimise the need for individual compound purification \nstrategies. Recognising that variation in the sphingosine and fatty acid alkyl chains could be introduced \nby simple cross metathesis and amine acylation respectively,46 the problem simplified to generation of a \nset of core hydroxybutenyl amine scaffolds, which in turn could be accessed from readily available \u03b1-\namino acids, Scheme 1.26-34  \nPage 6 of 19 \n \n \nScheme 1: Retrosynthetic Analysis of the common scaffold  \n \nSynthetic work commenced by exploring routes to the fully substituted ceramide core as represented by \n\u2018Scaffold 1\u201d. This was achieved following an approach developed by Katsumura,31 based on the \nstereoselective reduction of the vinyl ketone 12, Scheme 2. Whilst, in our hands, protection of N-Boc Ser \n10 as the TBS ether followed by direct addition of a vinyl nucleophile proved not to be viable, a stepwise \nstrategy proceeding via the Weinreb amide proved efficient providing ketone 12 in good yield (74%). \nReduction with LiAl(OtBu)3H was highly selective affording the desired  (2S, 3R) alcohol 14 with only \ntrace amounts (<1%) of the undesired diastereoisomer being detected in the crude reaction mixture. \nSelective silyl group deprotection was then achieved using dilute aqueous acid to afford the first core \nstructure 15. We then explored methods to allow a ceramide array to be constructed in a time efficient \nfashion minimising chromatography where possible. Cross-metathesis using the Grubbs\u2019 second-\ngeneration catalyst with a variety of terminal alkenes afforded N-Boc sphingosine analogues. \nDeprotection of the Boc group could be achieved using either TFA-DCM or HCl-dioxane mixtures \nalthough the former led to variable amounts of the corresponding trifluoroacetamide. Following removal \nof volatiles, direct treatment of the crude reaction mixture with the various acid chlorides in the presence \nof NaHCO3 (pH=8) afforded the desired ceramide analogues 17 in good chemical and stereochemical \npurities. Whilst final products were purified by chromatography where needed, given the array nature of \nthis synthesis, no attempt was made to optimise reactions in which low conversions were obtained. \nImportantly, with a view towards future larger library generation, it also proved possible to conduct the \nlast three steps (cross-metathesis, deprotection and acylation) with minimal chromatographic \npurification. In this case, partition of the final crude reaction mixture between dichloromethane and dilute \nPage 7 of 19 \n \naqueous acid (pH 5) by passage through a \u2018hydrophobic\u2019 filter tube (Whatman PTFE) provided product \nof sufficient purity (\u226585 % 1H NMR) to permit screening. \n \nIn an identical fashion, commencing from N-Boc Ala 11 allowed the synthesis of ceramide analogues \nlacking the primary hydroxy group, \u201cScaffold 2\u201d, as well as a homologated series derived from allyl \nketone 19, Scheme 2. Whilst, in this latter series the synthesis could be further shortened by the direct \naddition of allylmagnesium bromide to the starting N-Boc protected amino acid,47 the reduction of the \nketone 19 to the amino alcohol 20 was somewhat less selective producing an 84 : 16 mixture of the (2S, \n3R) and (2S, 3S) diastereoisomers respectively. These proved trivial to separate by standard column \nchromatography and the major isomer was taken through the metathesis and acylation steps as for the \nother analogues.  \n \nPage 8 of 19 \n \nNHBoc\nNHBoc\nv.\n10 R3 = OH; 11 R3 = H\n12 R3 = OTBS; 13 R3 = H\n14 R3 = OTBS (95%)   16 R3 = H (95%) \n15 R3 = OH(91%)\nNH\n17 R3 = OH; 18 R3 = H\nR1\nR2\nO\nvii.- ix.\nOH\nOH\nO\nHO2C\nNHBoc\nR1 R2\naz C13H27 CH3 51 %\nay C13H27 Bn 14 %\nax C13H27 C7H5 26 %\nbz C4H9 CH3 62 %\nby C4H9 Bn  40 %\nbx C4H9 C7H5  14 %\ncz PhCH2 CH3 51 %\ncy PhCH2 Bn 66 %\ncx PhCH2 C7H5 69 %\n21a\n82 %24 %\n86 %32 %\n85 %18 %\n44 %44 %\n48 %39 %\n52 %41 %\n55 %19 %\n17 %53 %\n45 %51 %\nR3\nR3\nR3\nR3\ni., ii., iii.\n18a17a\nReagents: i.

These could be \naccessed by asymmetric alkylation of the benzophenone imine of glycine following the precedents \nestablished by Corey, Lygo and others, Scheme 3.48, 49  Thus reaction of the glycine imine with allyl \nbromide and KOH in the presence of 5 mol% of the cinchona catalyst 29 derived from cinchonidine \nafforded the allyl glycine derivative 23 in good yield. Following exchange of the nitrogen protection group \nPage 9 of 19 \n \nand reduction of the ester, metathesis and acylation, as before, afforded the desired set of ceramide \nanalogues 27. Replacing the phase-transfer catalyst in the initial alkylation with that 28 derived from \ncinchonine provided access to the enantiomeric amino alcohol in similarly good yields.

The amount of labelled product, inositol phosphoryl-\nNBD-C6-ceramide (NBD-C6-IPC), formed was then quantified. The ratio between this value and that for a \ncontrol reaction, without the addition of an analogue, provided a measure of competitive binding \/ \ninhibition. Notably, the calculated Z-factor for this system is > 0.5 rating the assay as statistically valid for \nscreening purposes.50 \n \nThis screen identified 24 compounds that reduced the quantity of LmjIPCS synthesized NBD-C6-IPC by \n> 40%.  Of these, 13 compounds reduced formation of labelled product by > 50% including 3 by > 75%, \n(Figure 3 & Table 1). The results indicated a proportional increase in the inhibitory effect of the ceramide \nanalogues based on their hydrophobicity. With the exception of three derivatives (Table 1 entries 24, 28 \nand 48), all compounds that exhibited greater than 40 % inhibition of LmjIPCS with respect to formation \nof NBD-C6-IPC, contained a long hydrophobic sphingosine tail (R1 = C13H27). This observation strongly \nsuggests that the chain length of the sphingosine tail is crucial for binding to the enzyme, as might be \nexpected given the hydrophobic nature of LmjIPCS as an integral membrane enzyme. Similarly, \nincreasing the hydrophobicity of the N-acyl moiety appeared to favour its affinity for LmjIPCS as \ndetermined by the reduction in NBD-C6-IPC synthesis. However, the effect was smaller and less \nconsistent than that seen when increasing hydrophobicity of the sphingosine residue (Figure 3, n to x). \nConsistent with these observations, analysis of the N-Boc protected cross-metathesis products produced \nas synthetic intermediates showed similar trends (Table 1 entries 6-16).

Previous work has indicated that the trans double bond exerts a considerable \nPage 13 of 19 \n \neffect on the hydrogen bonding interactions of the 3-OH group in ceramide.51 Whilst the loss of this effect \nmay account for the observed reduction in apparent affinity for LmjIPCS in series 21, it is possible that a \nsimple conformational change enforced by the alkene position is also responsible. In support of the latter \nsuggestion, when comparing 1,3-dihydroxy analogues (series 17) with derivatives lacking the 3-OH \ngroup (series 26 and 27), it is clear that the 3-hydroxyl group exerts a minimal influence on substrate \nbinding. \n \nWhilst a number of analogues significantly reduced the level of NBD-C6-IPC production in the assay, this \ncould arise through one of two functions; either true inhibition of LmjIPCS or compounds behaving as an \nalternative competitive substrates and being processed to non-labelled IPC analogues. In order to \ndetermine the extent of each possibility a small subset of the assay reactions, involving both good and \npoor modulators of NBD-C6-IPC formation, were analysed in greater detail using mass spectrometry to \nlook for the formation of the correspondingly unlabelled but modified sphingolipid. Following reaction and \nfractionation as described, organic phases were subjected to positive and negative ion mass \nspectrometry. The resultant MS spectra (see ESI) were searched for the mass peaks [M+241] \ncorresponding to the hypothetical PSL products. Whilst compounds 17ax, 26af, and 26ax all showed \nsignals for the phosphorylated product indicating that these were viable substrates, no evidence for \nphosphosphingolipid formation could be detected for compounds 18ax, 21bx, 17bx, 27a,  26an  and \n26ay suggesting that these functioned as true inhibitors of the enzyme.  \n \nThese observation are consistent with the predicted reaction mechanism,23 in that analogues that lack \nthe primary (C1) hydroxyl group (e.g. 18ax) showed no evidence of phosphorylation and the presence of \nan inositol head group. However, these compounds do function as effective inhibitors suggesting that the \noxygen atom is non-essential for binding (comparing series 17 with 18). Not surprisingly, the N-octanoyl \nceramide analogue, 17ax, functioned as an alternative substrate as did its derivative 26ax which lacked \na 3-hydroxy group further confirming that this latter group is not essential for turnover by LmjIPCS. \nAdditionally, although ceramide analogues with a shorter sphingosine backbone (R1 = C4H9) resulted in \nmoderate inhibition suggesting competitive binding to LmjIPCS, such analogues (e.g. 17bx) were not \nprocessed by LmjIPCS indicating the importance of a long backbone for effective substrate binding and \nIPC synthesis. Moreover, incorporation of steric bulk into either the sphingosine backbone or the N-acyl \nmoiety appears to result in these compounds acting as true enzyme inhibitors (compare 27a or 26ay \nwith 26ax). In this respect it is pertinent to note that \u03b1-branched N-pivaloyl phytoceramide analogues \nhave been shown to exhibit relatively high inhibition of S. cerevisiae IPCS turnover. However, in this \ncase it was not stated whether these were acting as true inhibitors or alternative substrates.29 \n \nTo further investigate the interaction of ceramide with LmjIPCS four of the most active true-inhibitors \nwere analysed in dose-inhibition assays and the respective IC50 values determined (Figure 4). The most \nPage 14 of 19 \n \neffective inhibitor as identified in the screen (Table 1), N-octanoyl 1-deoxyceramide (18ax), had an IC50 \nof 4.79 \u00b5M is, not surprisingly, structurally the closest to the natural substrate. Consistent with the initial \nscreening data incorporation of steric bulk into the N-acyl unit led to higher IC50 values (Figure 4 C&D) \n \n \nFigure 4: Inhibition curves and IC50 values of selected inhibitors. Activity refers to percentage \nactivity relative to untreated control. Calculated IC50 values A (18ax) 4.8 \u00b5M; B (26an) 14.7 \u00b5M; C \n(26ay) 13.2 \u00b5M; D (27a) 15.0 \u00b5M \n \nPreviously we have demonstrated that whilst N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine was an acceptor substrate, \nD-erythro-sphingosine was not.23 Similarly here, MS analyses revealed that whilst N-octanoyl-3-\ndeoxyceramide (26ax) was turned over by the enzyme, its derivative containing a free amine (26an) was \nnot, and functioned as an inhibitor with an IC50 of 14.7 \u00b5M (Figure 4B). Collectively, these results \nsuggest that the free-amino group of sphingosine contributes strongly to the observed inhibition by these \ncompounds potentially through an electrostatic interaction with a positively charged ammonium salt that \nwould be formed at physiological relevant pH.23  \n \nSimilar observations have been previously reported, e.g. the inhibitory effect of sphingosine analogues \non the S. cerevisiae phosphatidate phosphatase,52 a member of the LPP enzyme superfamily believed to \nshare a mechanism of action with the sphingolipid synthases.14 Moreover, Sigal et al.21 have proposed a \ngeneralised hypothetical mechanism of action for such phosphoryl transferases, Figure 5B. This \nmechanism, in addition to the catalytic triad, involves one lysine and two arginine residues. These three \nresidues are presumed to be in a protonated state and are therefore able to stabilise the transition state \nstructure during phosphate group transfer. Moreover, Sigal demonstrated that one of these arginine \nresidues is conserved across different families of enzymes and organisms. This residue is located close \n(5 amino acids away) to the nucleophilic histidine residue of the active site. Investigation of the LmjIPCS \nPage 15 of 19 \n \nsequence identified Arg262 (in LmjIPCS) as a conserved residue in all the identified orthologous IPC \nsynthases in the TriTryp genome,17 Figure 5A.17 Consequently, Arg262 can be presumed a potential \ncandidate residue involved in the stabilisation of the transition state during the phosphorylinositol group \ntransfer by LmjIPCS, Figure 5C. This speculation is consistent with the hypothesis that the protonated \namino group of sphingosine can electrostatically interfere with the protonated Arg262 resulting in \ninefficient stabilisation of the transition state and inhibition of the catalytic transfer mechanism.  \n \nA. \n \nConsensus: \n     * * *** ***** *    \nAIFSYYCIVASRSHYTDDILVAI \n \n \nLmjF35.4990: LPISYYCILASRSHYTDDILVAM L. major \nLinJ35_V3.5030: LPISYYCILASRSHYTDDILVAM L. infantum \nLbrM34_V2.4930: LPASFYCILASRSHYTDDILVAM L. braziliensis \nTb09.211.1000: AIFGYYCIVASRFHYTDDVLVAI T. brucei \nTb09.211.1010: AIFSYYCIVASRFHYTDDVLVAI T. brucei \nTb09.211.1020: AIFGYYCIVASRFHYTDDVLVAI T. brucei \nTb09.211.1030: AIFGYYCIVASRSHYTDDVLVAI T. brucei \nTc00.1047053506885.124: VLLSFYSIIASRSHYTDDILVSF T. cruzi \nTc00.1047053510729.290: VLLSFYSIIASRSHYTDDILVSF T. cruzi \n \nFigure 5: A. Sequence alignment of active site residues of trypanosomatid IPCSs. B. Proposed \nmechanism of action of phosphoryl transferases adapted from Sigal et al (ref 21). C. Proposed \nmechanism of action of LmjIPCS \n \n \nSignificantly, analyses of the efficacy of the four compounds above against cultured wild type L. major \npromastigotes identified the free amino-derivative (26an) as the only one to reproducibly demonstrate \nsignificant anti-protozoal effects at the concentrations analysed. Under the experimental conditions \ndescribed maximal cytotoxicity was recorded at 12.5 \u00b5M, where cell viability was assessed as 4.6\u00b10.5 \nand 3.1\u00b10.7% of an untreated control in 2 independent experiments. In contrast, equivalent analyses of a \nL. major serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) mutant line53 demonstrated cell viability to be 14.6\u00b10.02 and \n13.8\u00b10.7% of the control. Loss of SPT function, which catalyses the first and rate limiting step in \nsphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, is tolerated by insect stage L. major promastigotes and renders \nLmjIPCS redundant.53 Therefore, this line will be resistant to specific LmjIPCS inhibitors. A similar \nPage 16 of 19 \n \nstrategy has been used to identify specific S. cerevisiae IPCS inhibitors.54 Although these mutants \nremain sensitive to 26an indicating off target effects, potentially an S1P ripple response,55-57 they are 3-4 \nfold less sensitive than the wild type line. This suggests that targeting LmjIPCS is a viable strategy for \nanti-parasitic agents. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nA library of ceramide derivatives built around a set of hydroxybutenyl amine cores has been prepared \nexploring variations in the sphingosine tail, N-acyl unit and the degree of hydroxylation. The ability of \nthese compounds to perturb the conversion of NBD-C6-ceramide to NBD-C6-IPC mediated by LmjIPCS \nhas been assessed using a microtitre plate-based assay. The dominant factor for effective binders, as \ndetermined by the reduced levels of NBD-C6-IPC produced, was the possession a long chain lipophilic \nsphingosine tail. Competitive substrates and inhibitors could be distinguished by MS analysis of the \nreaction products. Whilst the presence of the hydroxyl groups and a long chain N-acyl unit were \nbeneficial for activity, they were not essential for binding to the active site of LmjIPCS. Notably, a free \namino group conferred a true inhibitory effect (rather than function as an alternative substrate) and this is \nconsistent with previously reported models of the mechanism of action of this class of enzymes. \nFurthermore, this class of analogue demonstrated anti-leishmanial activity in cellulo with a significant \nproportion of this activity indicated to be due to on-target effects.  \n \nThese SAR studies will contribute to the development of a pharmacophore model of the active site of \nthis membrane bound enzyme and help guide the design of future inhibitors of this essential enzyme as \npotential new drug treatments for leishmaniasis. In this respect it is pertinent to note that through these \nstudies the microitre plate-based assay has been statistically validated for a future high-throughput \nscreening purposes with a Z-value > 0.5. Studies in this direction are in progress and will be reported in \ndue course. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nWe thank the BBSRC (BB\/D52396X\/1 to PWD), Royal Society (2005\/R1 to PWD), Wolfson Research \nInstitute and Durham University (Overseas Research Student Award to JGM) for financial support; Dr A. \nM.
