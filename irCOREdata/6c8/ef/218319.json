Contemporary migration has had its distinct history with significant waves \nof refugees migrating from the Middle East to Cyprus since the 1960s. In these recent times, \nLebanese and Palestinians have become the two largest groups of migrants to Cyprus. In addition, \nsince the turn of the 21st century and with the growth of the Cypriot economy, smaller waves of \neconomic migrants from the Middle East and Northern Africa have moved to Cyprus. Although \nArabic migration spreads across the island, an established Arab community sustains a strong and \nlong- standing presence in Nicosia, the capital. For this study we recruited individuals from different \nsocial and ethnic backgrounds, including Middle Eastern migrants and Cypriot- born migrants from \nlocations such as Lebanon and Palestine especially, but also new- comers from the Gulf region and \nNorth Africa. This article is based on six focus groups of three different age groups (three female and \nthree male; age groups: 18\u201325, 26\u201345, 46+) conducted in Nicosia, Cyprus, in June 2009. Each focus \ngroup included between six and eight participants of various Arabic backgrounds. The Nicosia focus \ngroups have tended to reflect the distinct cultural position Arab participants occupy in contemporary \nSouth Eastern Europe (i.e. being primarily refugees living close to the Middle East). Thus, the focus \ngroups revealed a number of distinct characteristics compared to the focus groups in other countries \nincluded in the Media and Citizenship study. Most importantly, among the Nicosia participants, we \nobserved more participants identifying as cosmopolitan subjects compared to any other group \nstudied in the seven EU capitals. In addition, a significant number of participants described diverse \nand rich media practices, which construct multilingual media worlds that include media in various \nEuropean languages, as well as Arabic national and transnational media. \nMedia practices All participants are regular television users and for most of them television viewing \ncombines transnational Arabic and western channels, national broadcasts from their country of \norigin and, to a lesser extent, programmes on national Cypriot television. Their viewing is usually \nattached to family and kin connections and shared daily experience, mostly cross-generational \nwithin the family and partly in networks of friends. The choices of programmes consumed tend to \nreflect negotiations of media choices within the familial domestic sphere, with decisions being \nprimarily taken by the oldest family members. In many cases, the family becomes divided in its \npractices and then media consumption becomes fragmented, especially on the basis of age, gender \nand linguistic ability. In the case of traditional families the choice is left to the father (especially for \nnews) and to other male family members. Most of the participants describe shifts on the level of \ntheir media consumption at different hours of the day and, depending on their work patterns, they \ndescribe regular shifts between communal and individual use of the media at home. The migrant \ngeneration tends to recognize the complexity of the younger generations\u2019 cultural identities, as \nreflected in their media choices. In the words of a female participant: \nMy kids are not interested in Arab news, this is why we have two satellite dishes and two \ntelevision sets at home. (Female, 46+) \nThough the research recorded this internal diversity in viewing preferences, transnational Arabic \nchannels \u2013 especially the news channels Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya \u2013 stand out as a primary \nreference. In the second place come the transnational western news channels, especially the BBC, \nwith a more reluctant viewing of American news channels, such as CNN. Almost all participants \nwatch national channels from the Middle East. Watching national channels does not mean that \nparticipants rely on them as the sole source of news. What these channels mostly seem to provide is \na social and emotional link to their country of origin. Only in a few cases are the Cypriot national \nchannels referred to as part of the media choices. Many of the participants consider Cypriot \ntelevision as irrelevant to their social world. Only the youngest females refer to Cypriot channels as a \nsignificant element of their media consumption. They especially refer to them as tools to \nunderstanding the Cypriot society and to learning the Greek language. This comes as no surprise as \nmost of them have been born in Cyprus or have moved to Cyprus at a very young age. What most \nparticipants describe is their regular consumption of transnational news programmes. Though the \ncore references are the two main Arabic satellite broadcasters \u2013 Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya \u2013 it is \nimportant to highlight the persistent presence of the main western news media channels, especially \nthe BBC, in their everyday life. \nI follow Al Jazeera, then Al Arabiya and BBC in Arabic and English language, and I follow the \nwebsites which have chat rooms about the political events to know many points of views. I \nalso follow the direct coverage of important events, on Arab or western channels. (Male, \n26\u201345) \nThere is a general understanding among participants that western transnational channels are for \nnews as they are more focused on the events. Most participants consider Arab media as highly \npoliticized, focusing on analysis and reflecting particular political agendas. At the same time, some \nparticipants are equally critical towards western transnational channels, which they see as biased \nagainst Arabs and as reflecting a distorted image of the Arab world and Arabs living in the West. For \nthose critical viewers, the Arab transnational media provide a counterpoint to what they see as \nimperialist, biased, or distorting ideological positions produced and reproduced in western media. \nImportantly even for those participants, western media often represent an element of their media \nworlds. \nWhen I need to learn urgently about an event, I watch the BBC English, when I have more \ntime, I turn to Arabic television. I feel that Arab media have not till now taken the lead from \nthe western media. I usually do zapping, but I always watch BBC English and French \nchannels. I watch Arab channels but I can guess what they will say, it depends also on the \nnews. In the case of Iranian elections, I watched also Al Manar. It was amazing to see how \nthey were trying to reflect a peaceful image of the situation. (Male, 46+) \nTransnational Arabic television does not only represent the major source of information for \nparticipants but it seems to largely frame perception of major crises in the Middle East. In discussing \ncrises in the Middle East, participants draw from thematic and ideological representations in Arabic \nchannels. Perhaps these representations also function as a tool to reinforce their emotional \nattachment to their countries of origin and provide a link between them and their present position. \n \nCitizenship, identity and belonging  \nAcross the group we have observed a dominant tendency to dissociate one\u2019s self from the identity of \nthe \u2018immigrant\u2019. For the members of the group who have been in Cyprus for a long period (or have \nbeen born there), the status of the \u2018immigrant\u2019 appears foreign. Instead, they prefer to define their \nstatus on the basis of \u2018staying\u2019 in Cyprus. This repeatedly observed attempt to distance themselves \nfrom the \u2018immigrant\u2019 identity reflects a widespread attempt among the participants to identify as \ncosmopolitan subjects; this discourse was much more widespread in the case of Cyprus than in any \nof the other countries in our study. For most, Cyprus is considered as a land of peace and \ntranquillity, allowing them to stay close to the Middle East and to keep open connections with both \nEurope and their region of origin. Many of them describe Cyprus as their home and almost everyone \nstresses that they have positive connections with Cypriots \u2013 these include work relations, \nfriendships, and sometimes marriage. A small group of participants emphasize that they still have a \nsense of being considered as others even when they have lived in Cyprus for decades. An important \nelement of many participants\u2019 ideology is the almost universal attempt to make Cyprus a place of \ntheir own, a space that captures specific meanings attached to their experience of migration. For \nPalestinians, it is a substitute for a lost land; in Cyprus, they can enjoy close proximity to the \nPalestinian Territories without having the feeling of being rejected refugees (as they feel is the case \nin most Arab countries). For Lebanese, the island is almost a metaphorical designation of a Lebanese \ndistrict, especially because of its geographic proximity. For some, it is a heaven of freedom, for \nothers, it is a heaven of sunshine and warm relationships. Overall, there is a tendency to combine a \nstrong sense of belonging to their country of origin with a cosmopolitan outlook: \nI am an Iraqi refugee because I cannot go back to my country. If I go back to Iraq, I need a \ngood school, safety, freedom, everything I have here, the same lifestyle \u2026 I cannot say I am \nIraqi Cypriot, I am only Iraqi but I can say Cyprus is my second country. (Female, 18\u201325) \nI don\u2019t consider myself immigrant, I don\u2019t like this feeling, I feel as an international citizen, I \ndon\u2019t feel a conflict between being Lebanese Arab and living here, this is why I cannot live in \nUS or Canada. (Male, 46+) \nMy country is where I can gain enough money to eat. These days we are defined as \neconomical refugees. I have another citizenship and I am loyal to it, but here I feel they treat \nme as a human being. I educate my kids to respect the country where they live but I also \nteach them our religion and our language and most importantly the fact that they are \nSyrians. (Male, 46+) \nFor most participants, citizenship has a narrow meaning and is primarily attached to the legal \nframework that defines their status in relation to formal rights and responsibilities. Holding a long-\nterm residency status or having a Cypriot citizenship seems very important for participants, \nespecially in relation to its practical benefits: safety, security and high level of mobility across \nEurope. Though citizenship represents an area of rational choice, for Palestinians, citizenship \ntouches the emotional zone as well. As mentioned by some of them, gaining citizenship after being \nrefugees for many years changes their condition of living. \nIn my family, citizenship was a word we lived with. We know that sooner or later, we will \nhave to get a different citizenship [i.e. other than Palestinian] \u2026 It is mainly about [having a] \npass- port because I don\u2019t belong to any country. (Female, 26\u201345) \nFriendships and long-term connections with Cypriots are common among participants. They refer to \nthe friendly attitudes of Cypriots as enabling their participation in the local society. Their \nparticipation varies from reading the local newspapers (widely observed) to participating in political \nevents (in only a few cases). Surprisingly, the large majority of them say they vote in Cyprus and not \nin their country of origin, as they trust the political system in Cyprus more than they trust it in their \ncountry of origin. This kind of engagement explains the fact that they are all at least fairly well \ninformed about political life in Cyprus. \nI vote here and I feel I can contribute to changing the results. (Female, 46\u201365) \nI follow their news through the local newspapers and though emails I receive from friends \u2026 \nI choose to learn Modern Greek at university. This is a decision to integrate. (Female, 26\u201345) \nWhile national and transnational media represent a key element of participants\u2019 every- day life, they \nare often critical of the national Cypriot media and other media from the West. Media are often \nseen as reproducing a sense of otherness and as boundary-setters between groups. \nThe only thing I remember [watching on Cypriot television] was the crisis of Islamic veil in \nschools in France. Then they focused on Arab migrants because of this problem, but only in \nFrance, and only in relation to Moroccan and Algerians. They mention us only when there is \na newsy crisis. (Female, 26\u201345) \nUnlike national television, the internet is in many cases praised as a tool in preserving links with the \ncountry of origin and with family and friends around the world. \nI have two chat programmes [on my PC] to communicate with my fianc\u00e9e who is in Jordan. \nThis is  how I don\u2019t feel far from home. We don\u2019t live in Syria but it is very easy to chat with \nour family there and to hear of their news. (Female, 18\u201325) \n \nConclusion  \nThe Arab migration to Cyprus represents a unique experience of Arabic transnational- ism within \nEurope, but also reflects wider issues in relation to migration, the sense of belonging and media \nconsumption among Arabs living in Europe. For many participants, the position of in-betweeness, \nwith Cyprus representing a location between the Middle East and Europe, reflects an ongoing \njourney of migration and transnational mobility. As illustrated in various occasions and captured in \nthe discussion above, Cyprus as a cultural and geographical context does not force the participants \nto make a clear choice between \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018away\u2019. This in-betweeness described by various \nparticipants might relate to what Beck describes as the dialogical imagination (2006) that surpasses \nthe binary of either\/or but which relates mostly to this and that, i.e. the possibility of holding \ndifferent cultural positions, without having to make singular and definite choices for the future. \nArabic transnational media play a dual role in this context. On the one hand, they are daily \nreminders of a diasporic position (especially when they engage in debates about the Middle East and \ngive rise to a transnational Arabic public sphere). On the other hand, they are part of a complex \nsystem of media consumption that links Arab speakers in Cyprus to the rest of the world, and which \nreconfirms their transnational position. \n \nReferences  \nBeck U (2006) The Cosmopolitan Vision.
