Introduction\nIn the last two decades, considerable progress has beenachieved in the development of traveling wave ultra-\nsonic motors (TWUM). Several detailed reviews [1]\u2013[3]\nhave been published that describe a range of constructions\nand their operating principles and characteristics. The mo-\ntors consist of a stator that uses piezoelectric elements to\nexcite vibrations with a frequency in the ultrasonic range\nand a rotor (rotary motors) or a slider (linear motors) that\nis driven by a stator via frictional force. Depending on the\ngeometry of the stator, generally two orthogonal vibra-\ntions (e.g., two bending vibrations) are superimposed on\nan elliptical motion on the contact surface between the sta-\ntor and the rotor. The high-frequency and small-amplitude\nvibrations then are rectified by friction force into a lower-\nfrequency macroscopic rotation of the rotor or a linear mo-\ntion of the slider.\nThe operational performance of the motor (e.g., out-\nput speed, torque, power, and efficiency) are determined\nmainly by the contact layer material and the compres-\nsive force applied on the rotor. To design a TWUM, it\nwould be valuable to have a mathematical model of the\nmotor that takes account of the contact interface, guide\nManuscript received October 30, 2002; accepted January 16, 2004.\nThe author is with the Institut B fu\u00a8r Mechanik, Stuttgart Univer-\nsita\u00a8t, Pfaffenwaldring 9, D-70569, Stuttgart, Germany; the School of\nIndustrial and Manufacturing Science, Cranfield University, Bedford-\nshire, MK43 0AL, UK; and the Institute of Vibration Engineering\nResearch, Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics, Nan-\njing, 210016, China (e-mail: m.zhu@cranfield.ac.uk).\na proper choice of contact layer material and understand\nthe influence of the compressive force and the contact layer\nmaterial on motor performance. Furthermore, it would be\nuseful for a priori calculation of motor characteristics, such\nas no-load speed, stall torque, maximum permissible com-\npressive force, starting up voltage, input power, output\npower, and efficiency.\nDuring the last decade, many modeling methods have\nbeen proposed for TWUM. The equivalent electric circuit\nmethod [4], [5] provides an academically pleasing analysis\ntool in many fields, but it is not a very useful design tool\nfor TWUM because it does not accurately model the in-\nterface forces: the normal compressive and tangential fric-\ntional forces. For example, the frictional force is repre-\nsented by a large parallel sequence of resistors and diodes,\nthe values of which have little physical interpretation. In\naddition, the integration of the interface forces over finite\ncontact regions is not addressed, and the interaction be-\ntween the interface forces and the vibrations of the sta-\ntor is not included. The finite element method (FEM) has\nbeen developed for the vibrational analysis of piezoelectric\nstructures [6], and the steady-state performance analysis\nof the TWUM [7]. The FEM was extended to the analysis\nof a transient response for three-dimensional (3-D) piezo-\nelectric composite structures. It was shown that this could\nbe applied to TWUM [8]. However, the contact between\nstator and rotor was not fully taken into account in [7]\nand [8]. In addition, a detailed finite element (FE) anal-\nysis of the contact surface was presented in [9], but the\ninteraction between the interface forces and the vibrations\nof the stator was not considered. Experimental techniques\n[10] provided an interesting method for the determination\nof the motor characteristics, such as stall torque, dynamic\nfrictional coefficient at the contact interface, torque-speed\nand efficiency-speed characteristics; but the experimental\ntechnique cannot easily and effectively be used during pre-\nliminary design. Many analytical models of TWUM have\nbeen published in the literature [11]\u2013[18]. Most early liter-\nature divided the modeling of TWUM into two steps. Us-\ning either analytical methods [11] or FEM [6]\u2013[8], [19]\u2013[22],\nthe motor vibration was modeled for the determination of\nthe mode shape, the resonant frequency, and the vibra-\ntion amplitude. Then, under the assumption that the sta-\ntor vibrations are not affected by the interface forces and\nusing an analytical model [12]\u2013[15], or equivalent electric\ncircuit [5], [23], or FEM [7], [9], the steady-state or tran-\nsient characteristics was modeled. Strictly speaking, such\na separation is not perfect because the effects of the con-\ntact forces on the stator vibration are not well considered.\n0885\u20133010\/$20.00 c\u00a9 2004 IEEE\nzhu: contact analysis of traveling wave ultrasonic motors 669\nFig. 1. Geometry of the stator.\nThe motor that has the component elements (stator, rotor,\nand contact interface) should be considered as a coupled\ndynamic system. More recent literature has paid great at-\ntention to this deficiency. For example, in [16], the contact\nforces were calculated and a mathematical model was pre-\nsented, which was developed into a design tool of TWUM.\nA mathematical model, which incorporates the rotor flex-\nibility into the model [16], was developed in [17]. A sim-\nilar model was proposed for the prediction of the input\nand output characteristics of the TWUM in [18]. Another\nmodeling method, which integrates equivalent electric cir-\ncuit, FEM, and mathematical modeling was developed in\n[24]. Furthermore, based on the model [24], an optimized\ndrive control for inverter-fed ultrasonic motors was pro-\nposed [25].\nHowever, a mathematical model that can guide the\nchoice of the contact-layer material and can be useful to\nunderstanding the operational characteristics of the motor\nunder the action of a compressive force has not yet been\ndeveloped. In this paper, a contact-layer analysis and a\nmathematical model of the TWUM is presented for these\npurposes. The model developed here gives insight into the\ninfluences of the compressive forces and the contact-layer\nmaterial on operational characteristics. The analysis of\ncontact layer is based on the consideration of contact-layer\ndeformation, strain, and stress within it. A mathematical\nmodel proposed starts from the model previously stud-\nied by Hagood [16] but differs from the Hagood model in\nthat it adds the analysis of the contact layer and steady-\nstate solutions of the nonlinear equations are derived in\nthe frequency domain, rather than in time domain, for the\nanalyses of the vibrational responses of the stator and op-\nerational characteristics of the motor. Using the model can\nguide the choice of proper contact-layer material, the de-\nsign of the dimensions, and the prediction of the maximum\npermissible compressive force and starting-up voltage of\nthe TWUM.\nII. Description of the Motor\nA detailed description of the configuration and the\nworking principle of TWUM can be found in the literature\n[1], [2]. A 3-D view is shown in Fig. 1. The motor consists\nof a rotor and a stator to which a piezoceramic ring, which\nexcites a traveling wave, is bonded. A contact layer, which\ngreatly affects the motor performance, is bonded to the ro-\ntor. The piezoceramic ring is divided into two parts, each\npart consisting of a number of sectors with alternating po-\nlarizations. By applying two electric fields with a phase\nshift of 90 degrees to the piezoceramic ring, two orthogo-\nnal bending vibrations with the same eigenfrequencies and\nthe same number of nodal diameters can be simultaneously\nexcited in the stator. As a result, a flexural traveling wave\nis formed. When the flexural traveling wave propagates\nalong the stator circumference, the particles on the sta-\ntor surface perform elliptical motions. Under the action of\na compressive force, the rotor contacts the stator surface\nand obtains the vibration speed of surface particles in the\ntangential direction; as a result, the rotor rotates.\nIII. Contact Analysis\nThe deformation and distributions of stresses of the con-\ntact layer under the action of a compressive force are de-\nrived in this section. For simplicity, the following assump-\ntions have been made during the contact analysis:\n\u2022 The stator is assumed to be a rigid body with a bend-\ning profile.\n\u2022 The contact layer is assumed to have no mass without\ndissipation.\n\u2022 Although the contact layer is circular, it is treated as a\nstraight beam because its width is much smaller than\nits radius.\nThe contact interface between the stator and the rotor\nis schematically shown in Fig. 2, where 2a, d, hc, P , \u03bb\nrepresent the contact length, the penetration of the stator\ninto the contact layer, the thickness of the contact layer,\nthe compressive force, and the wavelength of the traveling\nwave, respectively.\nUnder the action of a compressive force P , the rotor\ncontacts the stator surface over areas centered on the wave\ncrests of the traveling wave. Therefore, these contact areas\nare distributed and move along with the traveling wave. It\nis advantageous to introduce two coordinate systems into\nthe analysis, one for the x, y, z coordinate system moving\nwith the traveling wave, the other for the x\u02dc, y\u02dc, z\u02dc coordinate\nsystem fixed to the stationary stator shown in Fig. 2. The\nrelationship between the two coordinate systems is:\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\nx =\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\nx\u02dc \u2212 \u03c9t, y = y\u02dc, z = z\u02dc, (1)\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the traveling wave and\nt the time. As a result, the contact areas are stationary\nrelative to the x, y, z coordinate system.\nWhen the piezoceramic ring is subjected to an electrical\nfield, a traveling wave can be excited in the stator. The\nexpression is:\nws0(r, \u03b8\u02dc, t) = W (r) cos\n(\n2\u03c0r\n\u03bb\n\u03b8\u02dc \u2212 \u03c9t\n)\n, (2)\n670 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 6, june 2004\nFig. 2. Contact interface.\nwhere ws0(r, \u03b8\u02dc, t) is the out-of-plane displacement of the\nmidplane of the stator with \u03b8\u02dc = x\u02dcr and r = y, and the\nsubscript s denotes the stator, and W (r) is the amplitude\nof the traveling wave at arbitrary radius r of the stator.\nUnder the action of the compressive force, the deforma-\ntion of the contact layer can be expressed as shown in (3)\n(see next page), where \u03b4(R, x) is the deformation at con-\ntact radius R, d = W (R)\n(\n1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c0\u03bb a\n)\nand d0 is the initial\ncontact deformation of the contact layer under the action\nof P and is given by d0 = 12G\n1\u22122\u03bd\n1\u2212\u03bd\nhc\nS P with \u03bd, G, S being\nthe Poisson\u2019s ratio, the shear modulus, and the contact\narea of the contact layer. Whether the rotor is able to ro-\ntate depends on the input voltage. Without input voltage\non the piezoceramic ring, clearly W (R) = 0, so there is no\nmovement. For an input voltage less than VS , the starting-\nup voltage under the action of P , W (R) < d02 , the rotor\ncannot rotate. However, for an input voltage larger than\nVS , W (R) > d02 , the rotor may be able to rotate depending\non the value of the compressive force.\nUsing the displacement functions commonly used in me-\nchanics, the stress and strain distributions in the contact\nlayer can be obtained. The displacement functions can\nbe [26]:\nur(x, z) = A(x) + B(x)z,\nwr(x, z) = J(x) + L(x)z,\n(4)\nwhere ur(x, z) and wr(x, z) represent the tangential and\nlocal normal displacements of the contact layer, with the\nsubscript r denoting the rotor and are not functions of\ny as the contact layer is treated as a straight beam due\nto its narrow width. A(x), B(x), J(x), and L(x) are the\nfunctions determined in the following.\nThe contact layer is bonded to the substrate of the ro-\ntor, so ur(x, 0) = 0 and wr(x, 0) = 0 at z = 0.

Model of the Stator\nThis section will start from the Hagood [16] model and\nderive nonlinear governing equations of motion of the sta-\ntor. But the model derived here differs from the Hagood\nmodel in that it adds the analysis of the contact layer,\nand steady-state solutions of the nonlinear equations are\nderived in the frequency domain, rather than in time do-\nmain, for the analyses of the vibrational responses of the\nstator and operational characteristics of the motor. Us-\ning the model, the maximum permissible compressive force\nand starting-up voltage of the TWUM is given in the sec-\ntion.\nAccording to [27], the generalized Hamilton\u2019s principle\ncan be written as:\u222b t1\nt0\n\u222b\nVs+Vp\n(\u03b4H \u2212 \u03b4K)dvdt =\n\u222b t1\nt0\n[\u222b\nVs+Vp\nGi\u03b4ui +\n\u222b\nS\n(fi\u03b4ui + qi\u03b4\u03c6i)ds\n]\ndt, (17)\nwhere t0 and t1 are the two arbitrary time, \u03b4 is the varia-\ntion operator, H is the electric enthalpy, K is the kinetic\nenergy, Gi is the body force, fi is the traction along the\nboundary surface, qi is the electric charge, ui is the com-\nponent of the displacement vector of the stator, \u03c6i is the\nelectric potential, and i = 1, 2 and 3. Vs + Vp denotes the\nentire domain of the volume of the stator with s and p,\nrespectively, denoting the substrate of the stator and the\npiezoceramic ring, and S denotes the boundary of the do-\nmain. The terms on the right-hand side of (17) are the\nvirtual work.\n672 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 6, june 2004\nThe electric enthalpy H is defined as:\nH = U0 \u2212 DiEi, (18)\nwhere U0 is the internal energy, Ei and Di are the electric\nfield and the electric displacement, respectively.\nThe variation of H is:\n\u03b4H({\u03b5}, {E}) = {\u03c3}T \u03b4{\u03b5} \u2212 {D}T \u03b4{E}, (19)\nwhere {\u03b5} is the strain vector, {E} is the electric field\nvector, {\u03c3} is the stress vector, and {D} is the electric\ndisplacement vector.\nThe kinetic energy K is defined as:\nK =\n1\n2\n{u\u02d9i}T\u03c1{u\u02d9i}, (20)\nwhere {u\u02d9i} is the velocity vector of the stator and \u03c1 is the\ndensity of the stator.\nBecause the structure of the stator under consideration\nis a thin plate, according to elastic mechanics, the plate is\nconsidered to be under plane stress. In addition, the polar-\nization of the piezoelectric ring is in the z direction, and\nthe voltages are only applied to the polarized direction.\nTherefore, the electric field and the electric displacement\nare nonzero in the z direction only. As a result, {E} = E3\nand {D} = D3.\nThe constitutive equations for piezoelectric material un-\nder plane stress are:\n{\u03c3} = [cp]{\u03b5} \u2212 [e]TE3,\nD3 = [e]{\u03b5} + \u0007pE3,\n(21)\nwhere {\u03c3} = {\u03c3r, \u03c3\u03b8, \u03c4r\u03b8}T , [cp] is the elastic constant ma-\ntrix of the piezoelectric material, {\u03b5} = {\u03b5r, \u03b5\u03b8, \u03b3r\u03b8}T , [e]\nis the piezoelectric constant matrix and [e] = [e31, e31, 0],\nand \u0007p is the dielectric constant.\nThe constitutive equations for the substrate of the sta-\ntor are:\n{\u03c3} = [cs]{\u03b5}, (22)\nwhere [cs] is the elastic constant matrix of the substrate\nof the stator.\nSubstituting (21) and (22) into (19) gives (23) (see next\npage) where, for the PZT layer, the first term on the right-\nhand side is the variation of the elastic strain energy of the\nPZT layer, the second and third terms are the variations\nof the electromechanical coupling energy, and the fourth\nterm is the variation of the electric energy; for the stator\nsubstrate there is the variations of the elastic strain energy\nonly.\nFor the virtual work on the right-hand side in (17), the\nfirst term is zero because Gi = 0, and the second term\nis equal to the sum of the variations of the normal work\nand the tangential work. The effect of the tangential trac-\ntion upon the out-of-plane vibration of the stator is rather\nsmall, which had been confirmed by the simulation results\nin [16]. The simulation results are understandable and can\nbe physically interpreted. Because the tangential traction\nis vertical to the out-of-plane vibration of the stator, the\nwork done by the tangential traction is equal to zero. In\naddition, the tangential traction has a different sign in the\ncontact region, part of work done by the tangential trac-\ntion is partly canceled by each other. Therefore, neglect\nthe tangential work term and merely consider the normal\nwork term in the governing equations of motion of the sta-\ntor. The variation of the normal work is:\n\u03b4Wn = nb\n\u222b \u03c9t+2\u03c0a\/\u03bb\n\u03c9t\u22122\u03c0a\/\u03bb\np(x\u02c6)\u03b4ws0(R, x\u02c6, t)dx\u02c6. (24)\nThe third term is\n\u222b\nS qi\u03b4\u03c6ids =\n\u222b\nS q3\u03b4\u03c63ds.\nDue to small, in-plane inertia, it is assumed that in-\nplane displacements of the midplane are zero, that is,\nus0(r, \u03b8\u02dc, t) = 0 and vs0(r, \u03b8\u02dc, t) = 0. According to the Kir-\nchoff\u2019s plate theory, the displacement vector of the stator\ncan be written in the cylindrical coordinate system as:\n{ui} =\n\u23a7\u23a8\n\u23a9\nus(r, \u03b8\u02dc, z, t)\nvs(r, \u03b8\u02dc, z, t)\nws(r, \u03b8\u02dc, z, t)\n\u23ab\u23ac\n\u23ad = \u03a6inertiaws0(r, \u03b8\u02dc, t), (25)\nwhere \u03a6inertia =\n{\n\u2212z \u2202\u2202r \u2212 zr \u2202\u2202\u03b8\u02dc 1\n}T\n.

Numerical Results and Discussions\nTo obtain numerical results from the present model, the\nshape function, g(r), is introduced:\ng(r) = a1\n(\nr \u2212 ri\nro \u2212 ri\n)2\n+ a2\n(\nr \u2212 ri\nro \u2212 ri\n)3\n, (49)\nwhere a1 and a2 are the coefficients determined by the\nRayleigh Ritz method, ri is the inner-radius of the stator\nand ro is the outer-radius of the stator. The function satis-\nfies the geometric boundary conditions at the inner-radius,\nthat is g(ri) = 0 and g\u2032(ri) = 0. The material parameters\nused here are shown in Table I and the 3-D configuration\nin Fig. 1.\nThe piezoceramic ring has the same structure as Shin-\nsei\u2019s largest disk type of TWUM and can excite a trav-\neling wave with nine wavelengths. MATLAB (The Math\nWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) software is used for the simula-\ntion and the function, fzero, which can find a zero of one\nequation with one variable, is used to solve (39) and (42).\nThe maximum permissible compressive force of the motor,\nthe influences of the contact layer material, the thickness\nof the contact layer, and the compressive force on motor\nperformance are discussed in this section.\nA. Maximum Permissible Compressive Force of the\nMotor (Pmax)\nThe Pmax as a function of frequency has been simulated\nfor different contact layer material and is shown in Fig. 3\nfor specific values of V , hc, and \u03c2. From Fig. 3, it can be\nobserved that, the Young\u2019s modulus of the contact layer\nmaterial has different influence on the Pmax in a different\nfrequency range. For \u03c9\u03c9n < 1, the motor system seems to\nbe a static system and the higher value the Young\u2019s mod-\nulus of the contact layer material, the greater the contact\nstiffness and the higher the Pmax. For \u03c9\u03c9n > 1, the motor\nsystem seems to be a dynamic system because, in this case,\nFig. 3. Maximum permissible compressive forces of the motor where\nV = 150 V, hc = 0.5 mm, and \u03b6 = 1%.\nPmax is determined by the mass, the stiffness of the sta-\ntor, and the contact layer and the damping. For \u03c9\u03c9n > 1\nand near 1, the less the contact stiffness, the higher the\nPmax. The phenomenon is very similar to dynamic design\nof shafts at high speed in which the lower the stiffness the\nhigher the load the shaft can be subjected to.\nB. Influence of the Contact Layer Material on\nMotor Performance\nHowever, from Fig. 3, it cannot be concluded that the\ncontact layer with a lower Young\u2019s modulus always gives\nimproved motor characteristics for \u03c9\u03c9n > 1 and near 1. The\nfrequency responses of the amplitude of the traveling wave\nof the stator, the contact length between the stator and\nrotor and rotation speed of the rotor for different con-\ntact layer material have been simulated and are shown in\nFig. 4 with P , Mapplied, V , hc, \u00b5, and \u03c2 having values of\n\u221280 N, 0.15 Nm, 50 V, 0.5 mm, 0.18 and 1%, respectively.\nFrom these figures, it can be seen that the contact layer\nmaterial only has a small effect on the amplitude of the\ntraveling wave of the stator, but it has great effect on the\ncontact length and the rotation speed of the motor. There\nis a notch shape of the contact length when the frequency\nis near to the resonant frequency of the motor system.\nThe main reason is that, when the motor system works\nnear to the resonant frequency, the amplitude of the vi-\nbration of the stator has a peak shape. This leads to the\ndistribution of the normal compressive stress with a very\nlarger amplitude, which based on (15) when P holds a\nconstant. Due to the large amplitude of the normal com-\npressive force between the contact surface, it only needs a\nshort contact length to balance the compressive force. So\nthe contact length sharply reduces when the frequency is\nnear to the resonant frequency of the motor system, and\nthere is a notch shape of the contact length. Therefore,\nit is concluded that the contact stiffness only has a small\n676 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 6, june 2004\nFig. 4.

Bottom,\nFrequency response of the motor for different contact layer materials\nwhere P = \u221280 N, Mapplied = 0.15 Nm, V = 150 V, hc = 0.5 mm,\n\u00b5 = 0.18, and \u03b6 = 1%.\neffect on the stator vibration system due to a small shift\nof the peak and the lower the Young\u2019s modulus, the longer\nthe contact length and the lower the rotation speed of the\nmotor. The phenomenon can be explained by means of\nthe contact stiffness. It is well-known that the lower the\nYoung\u2019s modulus, the lower the contact stiffness. So the\ncontact layer with a lower Young\u2019s modulus has a larger\ncontact length under the action of the same compressive\nforce. Therefore, in order to balance the external load, a\nlonger contact length results in a lower speed of the rotor.\nThis can be interpreted by the distribution of the tangen-\ntial velocities of the stator and rotor, shown in Fig. 2. At\npoints A and B, the speed of rotor is equal to the speed\nof stator. Due to the different relative speed between the\nstator and rotor, zones I, II, and III have different direc-\ntions of frictional forces. In the zones I and III, the speed\nof the rotor is larger than the speed of the stator. The fric-\ntional forces FI and FIII are opposite to the direction of\nthe rotor speed. In zone II, the speed of the rotor is less\nthan the speed of the stator. The frictional force FII has\nthe same direction as the rotor speed. Under the action\nof external load Fe, the balance equation of the forces is\nthat Fe = FII \u2212 FI \u2212 FIII for the contact surface. Under\nthe action of the same external force and even Fe = 0,\nin order to remain the balance equation, a longer contact\nlength causes points A and B to move toward points C\nand D, respectively. So a longer contact length results in a\nlower speed of the rotor. It should be mentioned that the\nfriction coefficient is strongly related to different contact\nlayer material. But here, in order to discuss the influence\nof the contact layer stiffness on motor performance, the\nfriction coefficient is taken to be a constants.\nThe load response of the motor for different contact\nlayer material has been simulated. The motor speed versus\nexternal applied loads is shown in Fig. 5, where P , V , hc, \u00b5,\nand \u03c2 are taken as \u221280 N, 150 V, 0.5 mm, 0.18, and 1%,\nrespectively. Again, it is observed that the contact-layer\nmaterial has a great effect on the speed-load characteris-\ntic of the motor. When using material with a low Young\nmodulus, the motor has a soft, speed-load characteristic.\nFor a high value of Young modulus, the motor has a hard,\nspeed-load characteristic. Therefore, taking all these con-\nsiderations into account, the choice of the contact-layer\nmaterial should be based not only on the maximum per-\nmissible compressive force of the motor, but also on the\nfrequency response and the load characteristics of the mo-\ntor.\nC. Influence of the Thickness of the Contact Layer on\nMotor Performance\nIn order to understand the influence of the thickness of\nthe contact layer on motor performance, the load response\nof the motor at different contact-layer thickness has been\nsimulated. The motor speed verse external load applied is\nshown in Fig. 6, in which the contact-layer material is ny-\nlon and the parameters of P , V , \u03c9, \u00b5, and \u03c2 are taken to be\nthe same as in Fig. 5. From Fig. 6, it is observed that the\nzhu: contact analysis of traveling wave ultrasonic motors 677\nFig. 5.

The thinner the contact layer, the higher\nthe no-load speed of the rotor and the stall torque. There-\nfore, within the imposed limit by machining, the contact\nlayer should be designed to be as thin as possible to max-\nimize the motor performance. The reason for this is that\na thinner contact layer has a higher contact stiffness and\na shorter contact length. This results in a higher speed of\nthe rotor.\nD. Influence of the Compressive Force on\nMotor Performance\nThe TWUM usually work at or near the resonant fre-\nquency of the motor and can have better performance.\nFig. 7. Frequency response of the amplitude of the traveling wave\nof the stator for different compressive forces in which the material\ncontact layer is PTFE, E = 0.4 GPa, Mapplied = 0.15 Nm, V =\n150 V, hc = 0.5 mm, \u00b5 = 0.18, and \u03b6 = 1%.\nFor example, the motor is able to receive a larger input\npower and output high speed and high torque for a given\ninput voltage. But the compressive force causes the reso-\nnant frequency of the motor change. For this reason, it is\nvery valuable to find the resonant frequency of the motor\nunder a compressive force.\nThe frequency responses of the motor for different com-\npressive force have been simulated, and the amplitude of\nthe traveling wave of the stator is shown in Fig. 7, in which\nthe contact-layer material is PTFE and the parameters of\nMapplied, V , hc, \u00b5, and \u03c2 are taken to be the same as in\nFig. 4. In Fig. 7, the peak position of P being equal to\nzero corresponds to the resonant frequency of the stator\nwith piezoceramics, and the peak positions of P not be-\ning equal to zero correspond to the resonant frequencies\nof the motor under different compressive force. Especially\nemphasizing here, the resonant frequency of the motor un-\nder the compressive force is not the resonant frequencies\nof the stator because the compressive force changes the\nresonant frequency of the motor. However, the resonant\nfrequency of the stator usually is tested and used for the\ndriving frequency, although it is not the resonant frequency\nof the motor. The main reason is that most measurement\ninstruments of vibration only allow input a small signal to\nexcite measured systems. If using the instruments to mea-\nsure the resonant frequency of the motor under action of\na practical compressive force of the motor, the compres-\nsive force would completely suppress the small vibration\nexcited by the small signal. So, using the resonant fre-\nquency of the stator instead of the resonant frequency of\nthe motor for the time being. How to measure the reso-\nnant frequency of the motor under a larger compressive\nforce is an open question and needs to be solved in the fu-\nture. From this point, it seems more valuable for using the\npresent model to predict the resonant frequency. Further-\n678 ieee transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control, vol. 51, no. 6, june 2004\nFig. 8. Load response of the motor for different compressive forces in\nwhich the contact-layer materials is PTFE, E = 0.4 GPa, V = 150 V,\n\u03c9 = 1.0355\u03c9n, hc = 0.5 mm, \u00b5 = 0.18, and \u03b6 = 1%.\nmore, from Fig. 7, another two features can be observed.\nWith the increase of the compressive force, the curve on\nthe left-hand side of the peak frequency more dramatically\nsteepens and the pull-out phenomenon is exhibited. The\npull-out phenomenon is referred to the curve of the left-\nhand side is steeped and the curve of the right-hand side\nbecomes more gradual with the increase of the frequency.\nIt is not clear what causes the pull-out phenomenon. But\nthe author thinks that the nonlinear characteristic of the\nmotor system causes this. It is well-known that there is a\njump phenomenon in strong nonlinear systems. Due to the\nappearance of the contact force in the governing equation\nin (15), the motor system is a nonlinear system. The larger\nthe contact force, the stronger the pull-out phenomenon.\nThe larger the compressive forces, the larger the ampli-\ntude of traveling waves of the stator at the same exci-\ntation frequency on the right-hand side of the peak fre-\nquency. Therefore, in an allowable range, the compressive\nforce should be applied to be as large as possible, and the\nexcitation frequency chosen to be on the right-hand side\nof the peak frequency.\nThe load responses of the motor for different compres-\nsive forces have been simulated and shown in Fig. 8, in\nwhich the contact-layer material is PTFE, the contact\nlengths are all less than half the wavelength, and the pa-\nrameters V , \u03c9, hc, \u00b5, and \u03c2 are taken to be the same as in\nFig. 5. From Fig. 8, two features can be observed. No-load\nspeed of the motor increases with an increase of the com-\npressive force. This can be understood and explained by\nmeans of the amplitude of the traveling wave of the stator.\nThe reason is that the amplitude of the traveling wave in\nthe steady state becomes larger with an increase of the\ncompressive force. The stall torque increases proportion-\nally with the compressive force. It is noted that the con-\nclusion is true only if the contact length is less than half\nwavelength. Otherwise, it is false. Furthermore, in order\nto show the false, the case is simulated that the contact\nFig. 9.

From Fig. 9, it is ob-\nserved that the no-load speed of the motor first increases\nwith the compressive force, then dramatically decreases\nwith the increase of the compressive force, and the stall\ntorque is not proportional to the compressive force in the\ncase of P = 120 N because the contact length is over half\nwavelength.\nVII. Conclusions\nThis paper focuses on a contact analysis of TWUM and\nincorporates the analysis into the model previously studied\nby Hagood for a proper choice and design of contact-layer\nmaterial and parameters and for understanding how the\ncompressive force governs motor performance. The model\nhere differs from the Hagood\u2019s model. A new contact anal-\nysis model is proposed. The steady-state solution to the\nnonlinear governing equations of motion of the stator is\nderived in the frequency domain, rather than in the time\ndomain. The present model can predict some special char-\nacteristics and behavior of the motors, including the max-\nimum compressive force of the motor, the starting-up volt-\nage, the stall torque, the pull-out phenomenon, the reso-\nnant frequency of the motor under the action of the com-\npressive force, and the effect of the contact-layer material\nand the thickness of the contact layer on the motor char-\nacteristics.\nBy use of the proposed model, a series of frequency re-\nsponse and operational characteristics of the motor perfor-\nmance have been simulated. The influences of the contact-\nlayer material, the thickness, and the compressive force\nzhu: contact analysis of traveling wave ultrasonic motors 679\non the motor performance are discussed and physically in-\nterpreted. They are useful to understand the influence of\nthe compressive force and contact-layer material on motor\nperformance. They also are used for a prior calculation of\nmotor characteristics, such as no-load speed, stall torque,\nmaximum permissible compressive force, starting-up volt-\nage, natural frequency, input power, output power, and\nefficiency. However, the present model does not take into\naccount the effect of the tangential forces on the stator\nvibration and does not consider the viscoelastic behavior\nof the contact layer and the variation of the dynamic fric-\ntion versus the axial preload and sliding speed. In spite of\nthese deficiencies, the present model is a step forward, a\nfurther development in analyzing the contact layer and so\nwill be of assistance in the design of the TWUM with high\nperformance.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was performed with the support of the\nAlexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany.
