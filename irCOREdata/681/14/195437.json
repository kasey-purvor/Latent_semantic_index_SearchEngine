Introduction\nSelf-assembled quantum dots are being studied intensively because of their\npotential applications to optoelectronics, quantum cryptography and quantum\ncomputing (Petroff, 2001). A number of methods for calculating the eigen-\nstates of electrons and holes in self-assembled dots have been developed (Grund-\nmann, 1995; Cusack, 1996; Barker, 1999; Barker, 2000) but most of the tech-\nniques used so far involve very large scale computations. As applications of\ndots become more important it will be necessary to go beyond the computation\nof energies and eigenstates and develop techniques to compute other physical\nproperties of dots, such as relaxation times. The calculation of the eigenstates\nis just one step in the problem of calculating the physical properties of a dot so\nit is advantageous to have a method which generates them efficiently. The pur-\n2pose of this work is to review one particular approach to efficient calculation\nof electron states (Roy, 2003) together with its application to Auger relaxation\n(Chaney, 2003).\nOne of the reasons why the calculation of self-assembled dot states involves\nlarge scale computations is that there is no natural basis in which to expand\nthe dot eigenstates. The problem can of course be solved by expanding in\nany basis set, such as plane waves, but this generally leads to Hamiltonian\nmatrices of very large dimension and makes the computation expensive. We\nhave developed an alternative approach in which a harmonic oscillator basis\nis used and its parameters are optimised variationally before the Hamiltonian\nmatrix is found. This generally leads to a large reduction in the number of basis\nstates needed to represent the dot states accurately because the low lying basis\nstates (i.e. the ones with a few nodes) are localised on a length scale similar to\nthe real dot states. In section 1.2 we describe our approach and detail the dot\nmodels to which it has been applied.\nFollowing the discussion of dot states we consider Auger relaxation rates\nin section 1.3. Until now, most work on Auger relaxation has involved model\ndot states with rates calculated in the dipole approximation (Uskov, 1997).\nAt first sight the dipole approximation should be very accurate because of the\nsmall spatial extent of the dot states but we have found a surprising discrepancy\nbetween exact Auger rates and rates calculated in the dipole approximation.\nThe nature of this discrepancy and the reason why it occurs are detailed in\nsection 1.3.0. Following this we give Auger rates for a number of pyramidal dot\nmodels, compare them with rates for a harmonic oscillator model and comment\non the suitability of this model. Our conclusions are summarised in section 1.4.\n2. Harmonic Oscillator Basis Calculation of Electron\nStates\nDot Model and Schroedinger Equation\n18 18\n5\nIncGa1-cAs GaAs\n0.6\nInAs\nFigure 1. Dot model based on results of Bruls et al.\nCalculation of Self-Assembled Dot States: Application to Auger Relaxation 3\nThe structure and composition of self-assembled dots have been under in-\nvestigation for some time and knowledge of these systems is still evolving,\nsee (Grundmann, 1995; Joyce, 1998; Liu, 2000; Fry, 2000) for example. In\nour work we have used scanning tunnelling microscopy results of Bruls et al\n(Bruls, 2002) as a starting point for constructing dot models. In this section we\ndiscuss the calculation of electron states for a particular model that we take to\nbe typical, although not definitive, and in section 1.3 we consider Auger relax-\nation rates for a number of variations of this model. However our calculation\nmethod is completely general and can be used to find the quantum states of\ndots of arbitrary size, shape and composition.\nThe particular dot studied by Bruls et al (Fig. 1) is a truncated pyramid\ncomposed of with the Indium fraction varying linearly from 0.6\nat the base to 1.0 at the top. We have no information about the composition\nvariation in the lateral direction so we have assumed that the only composition\nvariation is in the vertical direction. The dot base dimensions are 18 nm 18\nnm, the dot height is 5 nm and the top face dimensions are 10.6 nm 10.6\nnm. The dot stands on a 0.6 nm InAs wetting layer on a GaAs substrate and is\nsurrounded by GaAs.\nThe dot is strained and the strain dependent effective mass and confinement\npotential are needed to find the quantum states. We use a commercial finite\nelement package, Abaqus, to find the strain within the continuum elasticity\napproximation. The strain is calculated for a dot in the centre of a large block of\nmaterial, of dimension 140 nm 140 nm 65.6 nm, with periodic boundary\nconditions. The large size of the periodic cell ensures that the strain in the\ndot is unaffected by boundary effects. The lattice mismatch strain is taken to\nbe 6.7%, the Young's moduli and Poisson ratios for GaAs are 85.3 Gpa and\n0.32 while for InAs they are 51.4 Gpa and 0.35 (Bruni, 1992). Values for\nare obtained by linear interpolation.\nThe confinement potential and effective mass are found in the standard way\nfrom the strain (Fonseca, 1998). First, the electron and hole confinement poten-\ntials are found from the composition dependent conduction band offset, band\ngap and deformation potentials:\nr r r\nr r r\nr r\nr r r\nr r r (1)\nHere the electron potential has been written as the sum of the conduction band\noffset, , and a strain-dependent part, , and an empirical relation (Barker,\n41999) is used to obtain the composition dependence of the conduction band\noffset. The energy zero is at the unstrained GaAs conduction band edge.\nand respectively are the strain dependent contributions to the heavy and\nlight hole potentials, and respectively are hydrostatic and biaxial strains\nand , and are deformation potentials and their values in eV are (Fonseca,\n1998)\nr r r\nr r r\nr r r (2)\nThe piezoelectric contribution to the confinement potential is not included in\nthe present work but this does not affect our conclusions about the efficiency\nof our method. The effect of the piezoelectric potential on the energies of the\ndot states is thought to be small (Grundmann, 1995).\nOnce the potentials are known the position dependent electron effective\nmass is found from first order perturbation theory (Fonseca, 1998)\nr\nr (3)\nwhere and are respectively perpendicular and lateral effective masses\nand is the bulk GaAs band gap. and are the position dependent\nband gap and effective mass given by (Fonseca, 1998)\nr r r\nr r r (4)\nWithin the single band effective mass approximation the Schroedinger equa-\ntion for the electron states is then\nA A r (5)\nwhere is the effective mass tensor and we have allowed for the possibility\nthat the dot is in a magnetic field.\nHarmonic Oscillator Basis for Solution of Schroedinger\nEquation\nThe Schroedinger equation can always be solved by expanding the wave\nfunction in a suitable orthonormal basis, that is by putting\nr r (6)\nCalculation of Self-Assembled Dot States: Application to Auger Relaxation 5\nwhere the are the basis states. Usually it is advantageous to choose the basis\nto be the eigenstates of a Hamiltonian that is close to the one of interest so\nthat the equation becomes and the basis\nstates are chosen to be the eigenstates of . If is in some sense small the\neigenstates of can be found with only a few terms in the basis set expansion\nand the process is computationally efficient. In many cases there is a natural\nseparation of into , where the eigenstates of are easy to find\nand is small, but this does not happen for self-assembled dots because\nof the complicated nature of the confinement potential. Instead most authors\nhave used a plane wave basis (Cusack, 1996; Barker, 1999; Barker, 2000) or a\nreal space mesh (Grundmann, 1995; Stier, 1999) to find the dot states, however\nboth approaches are computationally expensive.\nIn our alternative approach the basis is optimised before use so that the\nlowest few basis states (the ones with only a few nodes) are localised on about\nthe same length scale as the dot states. We take the basis states to be products\nof lateral and vertical harmonic oscillator states so that\nr\n(7)\nHere is a Hermite polynomial, is a Laguerre polynomial, and\nare vertical and lateral length parameters and is an offset parameter. These\nbasis states form a complete orthonormal set for all values of , and so\nthe sum in Eq. (6) always converges to an exact dot state provided enough terms\nare included. We reduce the number of terms by choosing the length and offset\nparameters to minimise , where has quantum numbers ,\nand . Thus is a variational approximation to the exact dot\nground state and the length scale of the oscillator states is approximately the\nsame as that of the exact dot states. This enables us to obtain accurate dot states\nby retaining relatively few oscillator states in the basis state expansion. The dot\nstates and energies are found in the usual way by numerically diagonalising the\nresulting Hamiltonian matrix. A second advantage of the harmonic oscillator\nbasis is that the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field can be included with\nrelatively little additional computational effort. This is explained in our earlier\npaper (Roy, 2003) which also gives full details of our method.\n6Comparison of Harmonic Oscillator and Plane Wave\nMethods\nTable 1.

The\nharmonic oscillator results were obtained with , and\nwhich corresponds to a total of 11,025 basis states. The plane\nwave results are for for the same dot in a 60 nm 60 nm 60 nm periodic\ncell. 41 plane waves are used in the vertical direction and 21 in each of the\ntwo lateral directions which corresponds to a total of 18,081 basis states. The\nground state energy calculated with the harmonic oscillator basis is accurate to\nabout 0.1 meV but the plane wave ground state energy is about 0.6% higher.\nThe agreement between the two sets of results very good, with only a small\ndiscrepancy that results from a combination of the poorer convergence of the\nplane wave method and the difficulty of calculating the plane wave Hamilto-\nnian matrix elements accurately (Roy, 2003).\nThe superior convergence of the harmonic oscillator basis calculation is\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The figure shows the convergence of the energies of\nthe states that are bound in the dot. It is clear that the convergence of the\nharmonic oscillator basis calculation is the fastest. The accuracy needed for\nmeaningful comparison with experiment is about 1 meV or better. This can be\nachieved with the harmonic oscillator basis with just 324 basis states (\n, and ) while the plane wave calculation requires 7,425\nbasis states (33 in the vertical direction and 15 in each of the lateral directions)\nfor the same accuracy. Since the CPU time needed to diagonalise a\nmatrix scales like this leads to an enormous reduction in CPU time.\nAnother difficulty with the plane wave method is that the results are sensitive\nto the size of the periodic cell used for the calculation. Care has to be taken to\nensure that the tail of the wave function is sufficiently small at the cell boundary\nand ground state energies can be around 10% too low if this condition is not\nsatisfied.

Auger Relaxation\nAuger Processes and the Dipole Approximation\nThe rate of relaxation of a dot electron in an excited state down to the ground\nstate is a quantity that is very relevant to the operation of optoelectronic devices\n(Morris, 1999; Petroff, 2001). When the electron or hole density outside the\ndot, either in the capping material or in the wetting layer, is sufficiently high the\ndominant relaxation process is expected to be an Auger process where energy\nis transfered from the electron in the dot to the external particle. We consider\nAuger processes that involve electrons external to the dot, both in the wetting\nlayer and the capping layer.\nThe rate of Auger transitions is found from the Fermi Golden Rule in the\nstandard way by summing over all the transitions that conserve energy:\n(8)\nwhere and are the initial and final states. Exchange effects are neglected\nwhich allows us to take these states to be products of dot states and external\nelectron states. The external electron states are taken to be either 2D or 3D\nplane waves. In either case k and k are the initial and final wave-vectors of\nthe external electrons and is the change in energy of the dot electron.\nis the energy distribution function of the external electrons in their initial\n8state and we take it to be a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We suppose that\nthe dot electron interacts with the external electron via the screened Coulomb\ninteraction,\n(9)\nwhere r and r are the dot and external electron coordinates, is the dielectric\nconstant, is the Debye screening constant, and\nand are the bulk electron density and temperature. The screening effect of\nthe wetting layer electrons is neglected (Uskov, 1997).\nTo calculate the relaxation rate from Eq. (8) we need to know the electron\ndensities in the wetting layer and the bulk. We suppose that electrons are in-\njected into the bulk conduction band and relax down to the conduction band\nedge. After this they can be captured into the wetting layer and then recom-\nbine with holes or they can recombine directly from the conduction band. This\nprocess is described by the following rate equations\n(10)\nwhere the time constants are taken from experimental data of Liu et al (Liu,\n2001) ( ps, ps, ns, ns) and the injection\nrate is chosen to give the desired number of injected electrons.\nAuger relaxation rate calculations for electrons in a self-assembled dot were\nfirst performed by Uskov et al (Uskov, 1997). They used an axially symmetric\ndot model so the dot states contain an angular momentum factor, identical to\nthe factor that appears in the basis states defined in Eq. (7). In addition they\napproximated the interaction potential by Taylor expanding it about so\n(11)\nAt first sight this is physically reasonable because the spatial extent of the\nexternal electron state is much greater than that of the localised dot electron\nstate, so that typically . The first term in the Taylor expansion does\nnot contribute to the relaxation rate because of the orthogonality of the initial\nand final states. So if only the second term is retained the matrix element\nfor the transition becomes a dipole matrix element and the approximation is\nequivalent to the dipole approximation used in atomic physics to find radiative\ntransition rates. The advantage of making this approximation is that the Auger\nCalculation of Self-Assembled Dot States: Application to Auger Relaxation 9\nrelaxation rate can be found analytically in some cases but we have found a\ndiscrepancy between the exact and dipole relaxation rates.\nBreakdown of the Dipole Approximation\nWe have examined the validity of making the dipole approximation for the\nlateral coordinates, in other words making the Taylor expansion with respect to\nand only. We use an axially symmetric dot model and take the dot states to\nbe products of lateral and vertical harmonic oscillator states. That is, the states\nwe use for testing the dipole approximation are identical to the basis states\ndefined in Eq. (7). Instead of Taylor expanding the interaction potential in real\nspace we work with its Fourier representation,\n(12)\nwhere is a two dimensional vector in the , plane, the system is taken to be\nperiodic with area , and is the vertical position of the wetting layer. The\nexact matrix element for an Auger process in which the momentum change of\na wetting layer electron is is then\n(13)\nwhile the dipole approximation is made by expanding the second exponential\nfactor as Here and are initial and final dot\nstates of the form defined by Eq. (7).\nIn the case when the initial state is the first excited state of lateral motion\nand the final state is the ground state the exact matrix element is\n(14)\nwhere is the matrix element between vertical states:\n(15)\nwhich do not change in the case we are considering. The corresponding matrix\nelement in the dipole approximation is\n(16)\n10\nStrictly speaking, the dipole approximation corresponds to the first term in the\nsquare brackets but we have retained terms up to cubic order in to allow\ncomparison of the exact and approximate matrix elements. It is clear that the\nterm in square brackets in the approximate matrix element is just the power\nseries expansion of the exponential factor in the exact matrix element. There-\nfore the approximation is valid when . When the temperature is\nlow and the energy transfer is high, so and\n. In addition, and for the harmonic oscilla-\ntor states are related via therefore . Thus the dipole\napproximation is never valid no matter how small the dot is. A similar result\nholds in the case of relaxation of electrons in harmonic oscillator states inter-\nacting with bulk electrons. It is also likely that the dipole approximation is\nnot valid for real dot states. The lateral length scale of a typical dot state is\nof order . We have calculated the product for a\nnumber of pyramidal dot models and found that it is typically of order 1. This\nsuggests that the dipole approximation is typically not valid but as there is no\nadvantage to using the approximation when the matrix elements are calculated\nnumerically we have not pursued this issue.\n1e+08\n1e+09\n1e+10\n1e+11\n1e+12\n1e+13\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nR\nel\nax\nat\nio\nn \nra\nte\n (s\n-\n1 )\nConfinement energy (meV)\n2d exact unscreened\n2d dipole unscreened\n2d exact screened\n2d dipole screened\nFigure 3.

The vertical length parameter\nis 2.41 nm, the distance to the wetting layer is 2.5 nm, the material is InAs\n( , ), the bulk electron temperature is 1 K and the injected\nelectron density is m . Rates for screened and unscreened interactions\nare given. Qualitatively, the dipole rates show the same trends as the exact\nones in all cases but quantitatively they differ from the exact rates by a factor\nof order 2 - 3 that is nearly independent of the confinement energy. This is\nconsistent with the arguments in the previous paragraph. The lack of depen-\ndence on confinement energy occurs because the product is approximately\nconstant. The numerical value of the factor can be understood by considering\nthe matrix element. The exact and dipole matrix elements differ by the factor\n. Therefore the rates differ by a factor of order\nas found numerically. The dependence of the harmonic oscillator model re-\nlaxation rates on confinement energy can be understood by considering the\ndependence of the matrix elements, as detailed by (Chaney, 2003).\nEffect of Dot Geometry on Relaxation Rate\nTo examine the effect of dot geometry on the Auger relaxation from the\nfirst excited state to the ground state we have computed the relaxation rate as\na function of electron density for a number of pyramidal dot models (Chaney,\n2003). The models include square and rectangular based truncated pyramids\nand a square based full pyramid, dimensions are given in table 2. In each\ncase the dot is taken to be composed of InAs. The small effect of different\n12\nTable 2.

As harmonic\noscillator states have been proposed as a model for self-assembled dot states\n(see (Petroff, 2001) for a review) we have also computed rates for the harmonic\noscillator model. The results are shown in Figs. 5 (interaction with wetting\nlayer electrons) and 6 (interaction with bulk electrons). The temperature is 1\nK. The injected electron density range is the same for the calculations leading\nto Figs. 5 and 6 so the figures are directly comparable. All of the curves have\na similar structure: the rate first increases with electron density because the\nincreasing density increases the probability of an interaction and then decreases\nbecause of screening.\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\n1e+06\n1e+07\n1e+08\n1e+09\n1e+10\n1e+08 1e+09 1e+10 1e+11 1e+12 1e+13 1e+14 1e+15 1e+16 1e+17\nR\nel\nax\nat\nio\nn \nra\nte\n (s\n-\n1 )\nElectron density (m-2)\nSHO\nSquare based truncated pyramid\nRectangular based truncated pyramid\nSquare based full pyramid\nFigure 5.

This\npotential rises abruptly at the dot boundary. Consequently the pyramidal dot\nstates have a smaller overlap than the harmonic oscillator states with the wet-\nting layer. On the other hand, in the case of relaxation via interactions with\nbulk electrons (Fig. 6) the harmonic oscillator model rate is around one to two\norders of magnitude smaller than any of the pyramidal model rates. This is\na consequence of the form of the matrix element for interactions with bulk\nelectrons,\n(17)\nwhere is the volume of the system and is a 3D momentum change. As ex-\nplained in the previous section at low temperature so the ma-\ntrix element is of order in the low density, low screening limit ( ).\nfor the harmonic oscillator model is about 2 to 3 times larger than for the\npyramidal models and this results in the rate being reduced by about an order\nof magnitude. In addition, there is some further reduction through the value\nof the matrix element of . This result illustrates the difficulty of\nreproducing self-assembled dot physics accurately with a harmonic oscillator\nmodel. The length parameter and excitation gap of the harmonic oscillator are\nnot independent so it is not possible to match the length scale and gap of the\npyramidal dot states accurately with an oscillator model, however the oscillator\n14\nmodel does reproduce the Auger relaxation physics qualitatively, as illustrated\nin Figs. 5 and 6.\nFigs. 5 and 6 also show that there is considerable variability in the rates for\nthe various pyramid models, particularly at low density. The rate for relaxation\nvia bulk interactions is always the highest but the ratio of the bulk and wetting\nlayer relaxation rates is very sensitive to the time constants in Eq. (10) and\nthese time constants are probably system dependent. Composition variations\nare likely to decrease the relaxation rate for wetting layer interactions by a\nsmall factor because a composition gradient with the largest In fraction at the\ntop of the dot causes a small shift of the electron wave function away from\nthe wetting layer. Some of the relaxation rates predicted here are comparable\nto those measured experimentally by Morris et al (Morris, 1999) however it\nis difficult to make a quantitative comparison with these results because the\nelectron densities corresponding to the experimental conditions of Morris et al\nare not known. It would be very interesting to have experimental data for a\nsystem in which both the relaxation rate and the electron densities have been\nmeasured.\n4. Conclusion\nWe have reviewed an efficient method for computation of quantum states\nin self-assembled dots and its application to Auger relaxation. Our method\nenables dot states to be computed economically within the effective mass ap-\nproximation and seems to be useful for computing physical properties of dots.\nOur results on Auger relaxation indicate that the dipole approximation does\nnot give an accurate description of the Auger relaxation rate. We have also\nindicated the difficulties of using harmonic oscillator states as model states for\ncalculating Auger rates. The difficulties of using the harmonic oscillator model\nto describe self-assembled dots containing more than a few electrons have also\nbeen discussed by Petroff et al (Petroff, 2001) and in both cases the difficulties\nare caused by the very simple excitation spectrum of the harmonic oscillator\nmodel. Our theory predicts relaxation rates can be around 10 ps, as seen exper-\nimentally, but the rates depend critically on the bulk and wetting layer electron\ndensities and it would be very useful to have measurements of Auger relaxation\nrates in a system for which these electron densities are known.\nAcknowledgements\nThe numerical calculations described here were performed on a supercom-\nputer at the Leicester Mathematical Modelling Centre which was purchased\nthrough the EPSRC strategic equipment initiative.
