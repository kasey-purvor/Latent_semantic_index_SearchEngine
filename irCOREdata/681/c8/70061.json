Introduction\n[2] The continuously improving quality of seismic data\nrecorded at volcanoes has allowed increasingly sophisticated\nanalytical techniques to be employed. In particular, robust\nsource-time functions have been derived for very-long-\nperiod (VLP, 2 to 100 s) events at Stromboli [Chouet et\nal., 2003], and Popocate\u00b4petl [Chouet et al., 2005], and for\nlong-period (LP, 0.2 to 2 s) events in hydrothermal systems\n[Kumagai et al., 2002]. Source-time functions representing\ntime-varying moment-tensor and single-force components\nallow an estimation of the fluid pressure and momentum\nchanges that appear to be responsible for these events. Our\nunderstanding of the underlying physical fluid flow pro-\ncesses, however, remains poor. To develop the full potential\nof quantitative volcano seismology, links are required\nbetween known flow processes and the resulting pressure\nand momentum changes produced. In the case of magmas,\nthe occurrence of steep viscosity gradients and non-\nNewtonian effects complicate the scaling of natural processes\nto the laboratory scale. However, low-viscosity magmatic\nsystems, for example Stromboli, can be approximated by\nNewtonian behavior and scaling is considerably simpler. The\nexperiments presented in this study use Newtonian liquids to\ninvestigate low-viscosity magmatic systems.\n[3] Many LP and VLP seismic events are believed to be\nthe result of movement of low-viscosity liquid induced by\nthe formation and ascent of gas slugs, culminating in\nStrombolian or similar-style eruptions [Neuberg et al.,\n1994; Ohminato et al., 1998; Rowe et al., 1998;\nKirchdo\u00a8rfer, 1999; Rowe et al., 2000; Aster et al., 2003;\nChouet et al., 2003]. Ripepe and Gordeev [1999] suggested\nthat forced coalescence of bubbles at a physical barrier (e.g.,\na severe constriction in the conduit) must occur in order to\nexplain the magnitude of their volcanic tremor data from\nStromboli. They considered the viscoelastic response of\nbubbly magma when deriving repeat periods for seismic\nand acoustic events, and calculated pressure variations of\n\u000110 kPa purely on the grounds of changes in static head.\nThe source mechanisms derived by Chouet et al. [2003]\nfrom inversions of the VLP waveforms from Strombolian\nexplosions point to a pressure increase on the order of\n10 MPa, and their analysis of bubble dynamics suggests that\nonly liquid inertia during a period of rapid gas phase\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, B05201, doi:10.1029\/2005JB003718, 2006\n1Department of Environmental Science, Lancaster University, Lan-\ncaster, UK.\n2U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California, USA.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JB003718$09.00\nB05201 1 of 25\nexpansion is capable of producing a superstatic pressure of\nthis magnitude. A corresponding downward single force of\n\u0001100 MN is interpreted as the result of an upward accel-\neration of the magma column on top of an expanding gas\nslug. A superstatic slug pressure of 10 MPa at depth was\nalso invoked by Vergniolle [1998] to explain acoustic data\nfrom Stromboli. However, no mechanism has yet been\nproposed to elucidate the origin of a superstatic pressure\nof such magnitude. Thus considerable uncertainty remains\nin the processes responsible for LP and VLP events during\nslug flow, and the relative importance of static, steady\ndynamic, and transient fluid dynamic effects is unknown.\nVLP events also occur through a variety of other mecha-\nnisms [e.g., Chouet et al., 2005], but we do not address\nthese here.\n[4] Previous laboratory experiments aimed at the study of\nacoustic sources applicable to low-viscosity magmatic sys-\ntems have generally considered only smooth, straight tubes\n[Vergniolle et al., 1996; James et al., 2004]. This geometry\nis appropriate for the shallowest levels in a volcano, where\nthermal considerations control the shape of long-lived\nconduits [e.g., Bruce and Huppert, 1989], and such geom-\netry also provides benchmark data from which processes\noccurring within more complicated systems can be explored\nand understood. At greater depths, where conduit behavior\nbecomes increasingly controlled by the local stress field and\nthe presence of fracture planes, magma pathways are more\nlikely to be better represented by individual, or arrays of,\ndikes. This, along with the fact that edifices are generally\ncomposed of highly inhomogeneous materials, strongly\nsuggests that changes in conduit size, shape and angle are\nlikely [e.g., Chouet et al., 2005; Gutmundsson, 2005].\nSeyfried and Freundt [2000] investigated the effect of\nrough-walled conduits by carrying out experiments with\nconcurrent gas and liquid flows through a vertical tube\ncontaining obstacles. Their results suggest that the presence\nof obstacles is less important than slug coalescence pro-\ncesses for generating pressure changes. However, the un-\nderlying pressure changes induced by the ascent of\nindividual slugs, or by slugs rising within a stationary liquid\nphase, were not considered. Although engineering-oriented\nresearch has generated a large body of work on slug flow\n[e.g., Fabre and Line\u00b4, 1992; Taha and Cui, 2006, and\nreferences therein] the authors are unaware of any previous\nliterature on the ascent of gas slugs through sudden changes\nin tube diameter. Other work carried out on conduits\ndisplaying sudden expansions or contractions with single-\nfluid, bubbly or foam flows [Aloui et al., 1999; Deshpande\nand Barigou, 2001; Poole and Escudier, 2003], particle-\nladen flows [Sommerfeld et al., 1992; Founti et al., 1999]\nand liquid displacement by gas injection [Dimakopoulos\nand Tsamopoulos, 2003a, 2003b] has targeted variations of\nbulk fluid properties or time-averaged pressure changes. In\nthe present study, we further develop previous work by\nJames et al. [2004] to investigate the dynamics of a single\nslug ascending in a stationary liquid within regions of\nchanging tube geometry. To limit experimental complexity\nbut capture the essential physics, we restrict our attention to\na vertical tube with circular cross section. Our objective is to\ndescribe accurately the processes that occur during the\npassage of a gas slug through a change in tube diameter.\nThis is achieved through detailed recordings of pressure and\nforce data, and through observations of how these data vary\nwith parameters such as liquid viscosity and slug size.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Experimental Scaling\n[5] The slug flow regime describes two-phase flow where\nlarge bubbles with diameters approaching that of a confining\npipe rise within a continuous liquid phase. We adopt the\nterminology commonly used in the volcanology literature\n[Jaupart and Vergniolle, 1989; Seyfried and Freundt, 2000;\nRipepe et al., 2001; James et al., 2004] and by Clift et al.\n[1978], in which the gas phase is referred to as the slug. The\nlaboratory experiments can be compared with low-viscosity\nmagmatic systems using three dimensionless parameters\nrelevant to gas slugs ascending buoyantly in liquid-filled\ntubes [White and Beardmore, 1962; Clift et al., 1978]. These\nare the Froude number (balance of inertia and gravity)\nFr \u00bc Uoffiffiffiffiffiffi\ngD\np ; \u00f01\u00de\nMorton number (balance of viscosity and surface tension)\nMo \u00bc gm\n4\nrs3\n; \u00f02\u00de\nand Eo\u00a8tvo\u00a8s number (balance of gravity and surface tension)\nEo \u00bc rgD\n2\ns\n: \u00f03\u00de\nWe also consider a dimensionless inverse viscosity\nNf \u00bc Eo\n3\nMo\n\u0002 \u00031\n4\n\u00bc rD\n3\n2g\n1\n2\nm\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere Uo represents the terminal ascent velocity of the slug,\ng is the acceleration due to gravity, D is the internal\ndiameter of the tube, and m, r and s are the viscosity,\ndensity, and surface tension of the liquid, respectively.\n[6] In vertical conduit low-viscosity magmatic systems,\nthe typical ranges of these parameters are 0.1 < Fr < 0.35,\n105 < Eo < 107, 105 < Mo < 1010 and 16 < Nf < 5000,\nassuming 50 < m < 500 Pa s, r = 2600 kg m\u00063 and s = 0.4 N\nm\u00061 for basalt, and 1 < D < 10 m for the conduit [Seyfried\nand Freundt, 2000]. These ranges indicate that gas slugs\nascend within inertial and transitional regimes, in which the\nslug velocity is a function of both slug buoyancy and liquid\nviscosity [White and Beardmore, 1962]. In the experiments\ndescribed here, 0.038\u0007D\u0007 0.08 m, 0.006 <U0 < 0.3 m s\u00061,\n0.001 < m < 30 Pa s, 1000 \u0007 r \u0007 1340 kg m\u00063 and s \b\n0.07 N m\u00061, with associated dimensionless number ranges\nof 0.01 < Fr < 0.35, 200 < Eo < 1200, 10\u000611 < Mo < 107,\nand 1 < Nf < 30000. As the diameter of our laboratory-scale\npipe dictates a much smaller Eo\u00a8tvo\u00a8s number than found in\nlow-viscosity magmatic systems, surface effects will be\nrelatively enhanced in our experiments. However, for\nEo > 100, surface tension plays little role in slug ascent\nso that this difference should not represent a controlling\nfactor [Wallis, 1969]. The inverse viscosity can be used to\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n2 of 25\nB05201\ndefine regimes for viscous control (Nf < 2) and for an\ninviscid approximation (Nf > 300) [Fabre and Line\u00b4,\n1992]. The majority of our laboratory flows were carried\nout with 30 < Nf < 30000, although a few high-viscosity\nruns with 1 < Nf < 3 were also explored in order to observe\nresults obtained under negligible inertial influence.\n[7] Consideration of these dimensionless numbers indi-\ncates that our experiments cover and exceed the steady slug\nascent regimes relevant to low-viscosity magmatic systems.\nTherefore processes observed within the laboratory should\nprovide insights into volcanological situations. Note, how-\never, that the dimensionless scaling used here is only\napplicable to steady state flows, and that an equivalent\nscaling framework does not exist for transient or rapidly\nchanging parameters. Therefore care is required when\napplying these results to scale the transient dynamic phe-\nnomena believed responsible for some volcano-seismic\nsignals.\n2.2. Apparatus\n[8] The apparatus consists of an open-ended flow tube\nmounted on top of a gas slug source mechanism. The\ncomplete system is suspended on springs attached to a rigid\nconcrete ceiling (Figure 1a). The flow tube is made of a\ncircular cross section borosilicate glass pipe with pressure\nsensors mounted flush with the inside wall. Pipe sections of\ndifferent diameters are joined with short, concentric reduc-\ners (Figure 1b) to give a range of cross sectional area ratios,\nA0. The gas slug source mechanism is constructed from a\n300-mm-long section of pipe with internal diameter of\n80 mm and includes a gas release poppet valve located at\nthe top (Figure 1a). The release valve comprises a 48-mm-\ndiameter aperture, which is normally closed by the valve\nplate. Before each experiment, the slug source is charged by\nintroducing air at the base of the tube to form a gas pocket\nunderneath the release valve. The gas pocket is maintained\nat hydrostatic pressure by pressure balance tubes which\nallow liquid to be displaced from the source region during\nthe charging process. A slug is formed by retracting the\nvalve plate downward, allowing the gas pocket to rise into\nthe flow tube. The geometry and operation of the valve are\nsuch that a simple and continuous exchange current forms a\nsingle gas slug in a highly repeatable manner with minimum\ntransient effects. Hence as slugs approach the diameter\nFigure 1. Experimental apparatus. (a) The equipment consists of a liquid-filled glass flow tube mounted\non a gas-slug source mechanism and suspended from springs attached to the ceiling. Piezo (Pz) and active\nstrain gauge (ASG) pressure sensors, along with an accelerometer (Accz), are mounted at the positions\nindicated on the tube and source mechanism. The base of the apparatus rests on a force sensor (Fz), which\nis used to detect vertical motion of the equipment. Air is supplied to the base of the slug source, and a gas\nslug is released up the flow tube by opening the release valve. (b) Scaled sketches of the internal profiles\nof the flared sections used in the flow tube. The cross-sectional area ratio, A0, and relevant tube internal\ndiameters are indicated by each sketch.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n3 of 25\nB05201\nchange regions of the flow tube, they are ascending in a\nstable manner with all transients associated with their\nrelease having fully decayed.\n[9] Within the flow tube and slug source, two different\ntypes of pressure sensor are used, namely BOC Edwards\nActive Strain Gauges (ASG sensors) and PCB Piezotronic\nICP quartz piezo-transducers (Pz transducers). The ASG\npressure sensor has a frequency range of DC to \u00011 kHz,\nand an absolute accuracy of \u00b1400 Pa. The Pz transducers\nhave a higher frequency range extending from \u000110 to\n>100 kHz, but a less well-characterized absolute calibra-\ntion. Using the two types of sensors in parallel allows the\nrecording of both absolute and high-frequency pressure\ndata. With the exception of data collected in the concentric\nreducer, on which ASG sensors could not be mounted, the\npressure sensors are paired so that one sensor of each type\nis present at each measurement point (Figure 1a). This\nallows cross-checking of the two data sets within the band\nof overlapping frequencies, which facilitates the calibration\nof the Pz transducers and confirms that artefacts are not\nbeing introduced by apparatus vibrations.\n[10] At the base of the slug release mechanism, a sturdy\naluminum platform is used to position the apparatus onto a\nforce sensor (Fz). The force sensor is rigidly mounted\nwithin a solid metal casing, which rests on concrete\nblocks. Three threaded feet under the casing allow the\nsensor to be raised underneath the apparatus until the\nsensor is under a compression of half of its full scale\ndeflection, thereby enabling the detection of both down-\nward- and upward-directed vertical forces. The force\nsensor is an S-100 thin film load cell (Strain Measurement\nDevices, Ltd.) with a 50 N range, amplified by an AMP-\nM10K full bridge amplifier (Techni Measure). This trans-\nducer acts like a stiff spring (a bending beam with spring\nconstant of \u00012 \n 105 N m\u00061) and, in association with the\nmass of the apparatus (\u000130 kg), the system has a natural\noscillation frequency of \u000113 Hz.\n[11] It is usually recommended that the analysis of\nforce data be restricted to frequencies less than 0.05 of\nthe natural frequency of the apparatus. Only at those\nfrequencies can the recorded values be considered to be\nrepresentative of the actual applied force without the\nnecessity to deconvolve the data from the apparatus\nresponse. For our apparatus, this limits recorded forces\nto frequencies less than \u00011 Hz. Such low frequencies\nwere generally not observed during our experiments. To\nallow the use of higher-frequency data, we also calibrated\nour force sensor for vertical displacement. A micrometer\nwas used to measure prescribed deflections of the sensor\nhead, which were then correlated directly with the output\nvoltage. This enabled reliable relative displacement mea-\nsurements, sz, to be carried out over the required range of\nfrequencies (up to \u0001100 Hz). These displacement data\ncould be independently verified by comparing their sec-\nond time derivative, \u0001sz, with data recorded by an accel-\nerometer (34103A, \u00b11g, Summit Instruments) mounted on\nthe flow tube. Although this accelerometer is a three-axis\ndevice, only the vertical component (Accz) was used. In\nFigure 2, the raw and filtered vertical component of\naccelerometer data are compared with acceleration data\nderived from the force sensor, for a gas slug ascending\nthrough a flare of area ratio 1:4.4. Within the 2\u201330 Hz\nband, the accelerations derived from the force sensor\naccurately match the data from the accelerometer, con-\nfirming the reliability of the displacement calibration.\nBand-pass filtering the data between 2 and 80 Hz also\nconfirms the sensitivity of the force transducer derived\naccelerations at higher frequencies for which the acceler-\nometer response starts to roll off. Given that the sensors\nare not located in the same positions (see Figure 1), this\ncould alternatively indicate that higher-frequency oscilla-\ntions may be absorbed by the plastic (PTFE) seals located\nbetween the glass sections up the flow tube, although this\nis believed to be unlikely. Hence all vertical apparatus\naccelerations used throughout this paper are derived from\nthe force sensor data. Filtering has been carried out\ndigitally using six-pole Butterworth filters.\n[12] Output voltages from the transducers are sampled at\n5 kHz with 16-bit resolution using a National Instruments\nDAQ board in a PC. The experiments were also recorded\nvisually with a digital video camera (Canon DM-XL1 in\nFRAME mode) synchronized to the pressure data by\nincluding an LED binary counter (incremented by the scan\nclock of the logging board) within the field of view. Using a\nshutter speed of 1\/1000 s, the digital images can be\ncorrelated to the sensor data with an accuracy of \u00b15 data\npoints (1 ms).\n[13] Experiments were carried out using three different\npipe sizes with internal diameters of 38, 50 and 80 mm,\nallowing investigation of three different geometry change\nratios (Figure 1b). Here, we consider slug ascent through a\ndiameter increase (a \u2018\u2018widening\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018flare\u2019\u2019), a diameter\ndecrease (a \u2018\u2018narrowing\u2019\u2019), and a short section of increased\ndiameter pipe (a \u2018\u2018bulge\u2019\u2019). Three liquid viscosities (0.001,\n0.1 and \u000130 Pa s, as measured with falling ball apparatus)\nwere employed by using water, a white cane sugar solution,\nFigure 2. Apparatus acceleration and displacement. The\ntop panel (raw data) shows the vertical component of\nacceleration recorded by the accelerometer, Accz (black\ntrace), and vertical component of displacement, sz, obtained\nfrom calibration of the force sensor for displacement (gray\ntrace). In the lower panel, band-passed vertical accelerations\nare shown. The black traces are derived from the\naccelerometer (Accz) data, and the gray traces have been\ncalculated by twice differentiating the displacement data, \u0001sz.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n4 of 25\nB05201\nand a diluted commercial sugar solution (Golden Syrup),\nwith densities of 1000, 1250 and 1340 kg m\u00063, respectively.\n[14] The volume, V, of gas in a slug is measured by\nrecording the depth of the liquid surface below the release\nvalve. To enable the comparison of results from experiments\nwith different size tubes and slugs, we consider an equiv-\nalent aspect ratio, L0, for slug size. Assuming a static\ncylindrical gas volume, with diameter equal to that of the\nconfining tube, L0 represents the ratio of the vertical length,\nL, of the gas volume, to the tube diameter, D:\nL0 \u00bc L\nD\n\u00bc 4V\npD3\n: \u00f05\u00de\nAlthough L and L0 are convenient for comparing slug\nlengths, the shape of the slug nose and the volume occupied\nby the surrounding falling liquid film are not accounted for;\nhence accurate slug lengths are not represented directly. In\nour experiments, the head of liquid above the slug source is\nalways less than 2 m, and the corresponding slug volume\nincrease (<20%) due to reduced static pressure during\nascent is deemed to be a secondary effect and is neglected.\nThe repeatability of the processes (evidenced in the\ngeometrical similarity and stability of the slugs prior to\ntheir entry in the diameter change region of the flow tube) is\nillustrated by experiments carried out with identical\nparameters. Pressure data recorded over ten repeated runs\n(Figure 3) demonstrate the equivalence of the initial\npressure transients generated, even when a severe geometry\nchange induces rapid disruption of the gas slug. Usually,\nexperiments were repeated with identical parameters only\nfive times.\n3. Results and Interpretation\n3.1. Tube Narrowing\n[15] The flow processes that occur during the ascent of a\ngas slug through a reduction in tube diameter are the least\ncomplicated of those observed in our experiments, with\nsteady slug flow established both below and above the tube\ndiscontinuity (i.e., with no significant change in flow\npattern). Sketches of a typical transition, taken from video\nframes, are shown in Figure 4a, indicating that as a slug\nnose impinges upon a diameter reduction, a smaller-\ndiameter slug begins to form. Given that the ascent rate of\ngas slugs is reduced in narrower tubes (Uo \b 0.35\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ngD\u00f0 \u00dep\nunder inertial control), the upward velocity of the slug base\nstrongly decreases as the smaller-diameter segment of slug\nbegins its ascent in the upper, narrower tube. Volume\nconservation dictates that the smaller-diameter slug is longer\nthan the initial slug, so that L0 increases.\nFigure 3. (a) Base (ASG 1) and (b) flare (Pz 5, see\nFigure 1) pressure data recorded during 10 identical\nexperiments using a gas slug (L0 = 4.4) ascending in water\n(0.001 Pa s) and transiting through a flare with 1:4.4 area\nchange ratio. Data from each experiment have been\nvertically offset for clarity, and their similarity demonstrates\nthe repeatability of the nondestructive processes involved.\nThe bold black line at the top of each plot represents an\naverage of all the traces below (thin lines), and the dark and\nlight gray patterns superimposed on that line represent the\nstandard deviation and range in signal amplitude, respec-\ntively. (c) For comparison, seismic motions of VLP events\nrecorded at Stromboli are reproduced from Chouet et al.\n[2003, Figure 4] in order to demonstrate their similar level\nof repeatability. Data shown are normalized east compo-\nnents of velocity seismograms for 10 examples of two\ndifferent types of VLP event. Type 1 events were filtered at\n2\u201320 s, and type 2 events were filtered 2\u201330 s.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n5 of 25\nB05201\n[16] The pressure changes recorded during the passage\nof gas slugs through reductions in tube diameter\n(Figures 4b\u20134e) are dominated by both static and quasi-\nsteady dynamic (i.e., effectively unchanging dynamic)\neffects [James et al., 2004], rather than dynamic transients\n(i.e., rapidly changing dynamic effects). The quasi-linear\ndecrease in the ASG 1 pressure data displayed in\nFigures 4b\u20134e represents changes in static head and\npressure loss around the ascending slug as it passes\nthrough the region of tube narrowing (Figure 4a, sketches\niii\u2013v). Video data show that the onset of the decreasing\npressure ramp coincides with the slug nose entering the\nnarrow tube, and that the ramp end corresponds to the slug\ntail entering the narrow tube. An estimate of the overall\npressure drop can be obtained by using the static gas-\nvolume approach employed in equation (5), where a slug\nis represented as a stationary gas pocket with the same\ndiameter as the tube. Accordingly, the base pressure\nchange, DPb, resulting from the varying aspect ratio of a\nslug in different diameter tubes can be expressed as\nDPb \b rgL0lDl 1\u0006 A0\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere Ll\n0 is the equivalent aspect ratio of the slug in the\nlower tube, Dl is the diameter of the lower tube and A\n0 is the\ncross sectional area ratio of the flare (cross sectional area of\nlower tube\/cross sectional area of upper tube). This yields\nan estimated pressure change of \u00063.8 kPa for the data\nshown in Figure 4e, in reasonable agreement with the\nmeasured pressure drop of 3.4 kPa.\nFigure 4. Slug ascent from large to small diameter tube. (a) Sketches of the flow processes observed as\na gas slug enters a smaller-diameter tube, and (b\u2013e) the pressure variations and apparatus displacements\nrecorded, with slug position from Figure 4a indicated. Data plotted are ASG 1 pressure (black traces) and\nsz displacement measurements (gray traces) from experiments carried out with the values of cross-\nsectional area change ratio (A0), equivalent slug aspect ratio (L0, see equation (5)), and liquid viscosity (m)\nindicated in each plot. In Figures 4d and 4e, high-frequency pressure fluctuations believed to be caused\nby instabilities in the falling liquid film around a long gas slug are seen superimposed on the pressure\nramp. The inset in Figure 4e shows details of the series of pressure spikes revealed by the Pz 1 data.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n6 of 25\nB05201\n[17] Although the accelerations produced are below the\ndetection threshold of the accelerometer, small transient\ndisplacements of the apparatus (\u00011\u20135 mm) are detected as\nthe slug nose enters the region of diameter change (gray\ntraces, Figures 4b\u20134d). This sharp downward motion is\nsimilar in form and magnitude to that produced when a gas\nslug arrives at the liquid surface in a constant diameter tube.\nIn this \u2018\u2018slug at surface\u2019\u2019 situation, the apparatus motion is\ndriven by a downward-traveling pressure pulse which is\nattributed to the collapse of the liquid flow field around the\nslug nose [James et al., 2004]. We consider that changes in\nthe liquid flow field at the slug nose are similarly respon-\nsible for the downward motion of the apparatus when\ndiameter reductions are encountered by ascending slugs.\nHowever, in this case, an accompanying pressure pulse\nwould be difficult to distinguish over the onset of the larger\npressure changes resulting from varying static and quasi-\nsteady dynamic processes. Furthermore, as the slug changes\nshape upon entering the smaller-diameter tube, pressure\nchanges will be coupling to the apparatus at the diameter\nchange as well as at the base of the tube.\n[18] When large diameter change ratios lead to very long\nslugs in the narrower tube, the length of the falling film of\nliquid around the slug induces the development of observ-\nable flow instabilities within the film. Below the slug, the\nonset of instabilities is observed as the emergence of high-\nfrequency pressure variations above noise levels. For the\n0.1 Pa s liquid in Figure 4d, the onset of high-frequency\npressure fluctuations occurs at roughly 2.3 s into the\ndisplayed data. In a 0.001 Pa s liquid (water) these insta-\nbilities are associated with characteristic, repetitive signals\n(see events starting 1.3 s into the record of Figure 4e). The\nfrequencies produced range from the repeat period of the\nsignal (about 20\u201330 Hz, but irregularly spaced) to approx-\nimately 600 Hz (inset of Figure 4e). These pulses are\nbelieved to correspond to solitary waves [Lin and Gollub,\n1994] developing in the falling film around long slugs;\nhowever, as they are not the primary concern of this paper, a\nmore detailed study is left for further work.\n3.2. Tube Widening\n[19] Video images show that the transit of a gas slug\nthrough an increase in tube diameter can be a considerably\nmore complex process involving changes in flow pattern\n(Figure 5a). In general, slug ascent velocities are greater in\nlarger-diameter tubes. Therefore when the slug nose enters a\nlarger tube, the downward-flowing liquid flux around the\nslug nose increases. As this increased liquid flux descends\ninto the smaller diameter tube, the falling liquid film around\nthe slug body thickens and, upon reaching the base of the\nslug, accelerates the slug base upward into the flare.\nRelatively small increases in tube diameter (e.g., in our\nexperiments, from 38 to 50 mm) induce only slight flow\nchanges within the falling film and these are accommodated\nwith few observable effects. Greater changes in diameter\nresult in an increased thickening of the falling liquid film in\nthe smaller tube and increasingly rapid ascent of the slug\nbase.\n[20] For sufficiently severe increases in tube diameter, the\nslug nose travels only a small distance through the flare\naperture before becoming \u2018\u2018detached\u2019\u2019 from the wall\n(Figure 5a, sketch iii). The change in the liquid flow field\naround the slug nose (which determines the slug shape)\nallows the slug nose to expand sideways. A bulbous head\nforms as a result, and liquid begins to drain rapidly into the\ntop of the smaller tube, forming a thickening annulus in the\nfalling liquid film (Figure 5a, sketch iv). Consequently, as\nliquid continues to flow into the falling annulus, an increas-\ningly narrow neck is formed within the slug, just below the\nbase of the flare. Subsequent events then depend on whether\nor not the annulus grows sufficiently to close the narrowing\nslug neck before reaching the base of the slug. If the slug\nneck becomes closed, the downward liquid flux (originally\nrepresenting the annulus) now forms a liquid \u2018\u2018piston\u2019\u2019\n(Figure 5a, sketch v), which temporarily halts the upward\ngas flow, and disrupts the slug into separate portions. The\noccurrence of this process is determined by the cross-\nsectional area ratio of the flare, the liquid viscosity and\nthe slug length (or aspect ratio).\n3.2.1. Observations of Inertially Dominated Flows\n[21] In the inertially dominated experiments (liquid vis-\ncosities of 0.001 and 0.1 Pa s), with flare cross sectional\narea ratios of 1:4.4, the falling liquid annulus did not close\nbefore reaching the slug base for observed slugs shorter than\nL0 = 3.3. When this increase in downward liquid flux\nreaches the slug base, the annulus closes rapidly, producing\na single, relatively equant but highly unstable bubble,\nlocated just above the flare. This bubble then rapidly\nelongates by accelerating a narrow, pointed bubble nose\nupward, reaching velocities of \u00011 m s\u00061 (Figure 5b). The\nbubble nose then decelerates to the steady state velocity of\n0.3 m s\u00061 with pressure fluctuations accompanying changes\nin shape and bubble coalescence at the slug base. Stable\nbubble shape is regained within the confines of the appa-\nratus, at which point, pressure fluctuations subside.\n[22] The majority of the slugs used in our experiments\nwere sufficiently long (L0 \u000b 3.3, Figures 5a and 5c) that the\nwhole slug body could not enter the larger diameter tube\nbefore the narrowing neck was closed by the growing liquid\nannulus. As a result, successive sealing of falling annuli\nformed a series of short, liquid \u2018\u2018pistons\u2019\u2019 that sequentially\ndisrupted ascending slugs into several separated sections.\nOn the first occurrence of this process, the detached bubble\nin the flare accelerates upward in the jet-like manner\n(Figure 5a, sketch vi; Figures 5c and 6) described above,\nwith nose velocities of up to 2.8 m s\u00061 being noted\n(averaged over 0.04 s). Maximum nose velocities occurred\nin experiments carried out with L0 = 3.3, the smallest slugs\nfor which breakup was observed. These velocities are nearly\nan order of magnitude larger than the maximum steady\nascent velocity of 0.3 m s\u00061 for inertially controlled slugs\n(in a 0.08-m-diameter tube). The exact process responsible\nfor the jet-like ascent of the bubble is not known but we\nhypothesize it must be the result of transient pressure\ngradients generated by the arrival of the bubble and its\nunstable, \u2018\u2018equant\u2019\u2019 shape in the base of the larger tube.\nFluctuations in the diameter of the jet bubble nose are\nvisible as longitudinal waves propagating down the sides\nof the bubble (Figure 6).\n[23] After ascending a distance of 0.3\u20130.4 m (covered in\na time of 0.16 s spanning four video frames), the bubble\nnose stalls, the base catches up, and the bubble becomes\ndisrupted into a series of smaller bubbles by flow instabil-\nities and wake turbulence. These bubbles are considerably\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n7 of 25\nB05201\nFigure 5. Slug ascent from small to large diameter tube.

Open symbols represent positions of the slug (or bubble) nose recorded in individual video\nframes, and closed symbols represent the positions of the slug base. In Figure 5b, a small slug ascends\ninto the larger tube without being broken up in the flare. The slug is disrupted by turbulence shortly after\nentering the larger tube, with the daughter bubbles rapidly coalescing. We distinguish this from breakup\nwithin the flare, which is illustrated for a larger slug in Figure 5c.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n8 of 25\nB05201\nsmaller than the maximum stable bubble size for stagnant\nmedia [Clift et al., 1978, Table 12.3], pointing to the\nunstable and transient nature of the processes involved.\nDuring this period, the segment of slug remaining in the\nlower tube continues to rise until the process of neck\nformation repeats itself. However, in low-viscosity liquids,\nthe symmetry displayed in the first slug nose through the\nflare is subsequently considerably reduced by the turbulence\ninduced by the initial event.\n3.2.2. Observations of Viscosity-Controlled Flows\n[24] In more viscous liquids (\u000130 Pa s in our experi-\nments), where slug ascent is controlled by viscosity, slug\ndisruption can be observed in \u2018\u2018slow motion,\u2019\u2019 with disrup-\ntion occurring for observed slugs with L0 \u000b 2.2. Initially, a\nnear-spherical daughter bubble is generated from the orig-\ninal slug nose (bubble 2, Figure 7a). This is shortly followed\nby the growth of a second near-spherical daughter bubble,\nalmost identical in size and ascent velocity. Suppression of\nturbulence by the high liquid viscosity during the slug\nbreakup process allows the production of these self-similar\ndaughter bubbles, which are close to their maximum stable\nsize [Clift et al., 1978, Table 12.3] and maintain their\nrelatively spherical shape until they reach the liquid surface.\nThe rapid, jet-like ascent of bubble noses after separation\nfrom the slug body is not observed under viscous control.\n[25] Longer parent slugs are broken up into larger numb-\ners of near-spherical daughter bubbles. For L0 = 6.6, the\nbreakup process generated nineteen daughter bubbles from\nthe original parent slug, of which eight reached the surface\nin three discrete groups (of three, four, and one bubble), as\nshown in Figure 7b. The first two bubbles in the first two\ngroups (space-time fields 2, 6 and 8, 10 in Figure 7b) were\nnearly identical in size and ascent velocity. This initial\n\u2018\u2018double bubble\u2019\u2019 separation process was not observed when\nsignificant inertial influences (and turbulence) were present.\nSubsequent bubbles were less regular in size (space-time\nfields 7, 12 in Figure 7b), allowing, due to differences in\nascent velocity, bubble collisions and coalescence (space-\ntime fields 12, 14 and 18, 19 in Figure 7b) to take place.\n3.2.3. Pressure and Displacement\n[26] In contrast to the processes associated with slugs\nascending through diameter reductions, significant transient\npressure changes are frequently produced when slugs as-\ncend through increases in tube diameter. In our experiments,\nthe largest pressure changes were recorded by ASG 4 and\nPz 4 (located just below the flare, Figure 1a) under inertially\ncontrolled conditions. Figure 5b illustrates the typical pro-\ncesses observed for slugs that were too short to undergo\ndisruption in the flare. Notice the coincidence of a short\npressure pulse (\u000110 kPa) with the closing of the falling\nliquid annulus, and the formation of an equant bubble above\nthe flare. Smaller signals (<4 kPa) are associated with the\nprocesses of bubble breakup, coalescence and oscillation as\nthe equant bubble regains an equilibrium shape at about\n1.9 s. Figure 5c illustrates the slug disruption in slugs that\ndid break up during transit through the flare. The slug\nbreakup is accompanied by stronger pressure oscillations\n(\u000120 kPa) that are induced by the closure of the gas neck,\nforming a \u2018\u2018liquid piston.\u2019\u2019\n[27] Unfortunately, the presence of the lower portion of\nthe gas slug traversing the ASG\/Pz 4 region at the same\ntime complicates the interpretation of these data. Therefore\nto facilitate visual comparisons between experiments carried\nout with different geometries and slug sizes, we first focus\nour attention on the data recorded by the ASG 1 and Fz\ntransducers (Figure 8) located at the base of the apparatus\n(Figure 1a). Common to all plots in Figure 8 is an overall\npressure increase resulting from the changing static pressure\n(equation (6)) and steady dynamic pressure losses associated\nwith gas slug ascent in the different diameter tubes. Super-\nimposed on these offsets are oscillatory pressure disturban-\nces with amplitudes ranging from \u00010.5 kPa for a small slug\nand small widening (Figure 8a) up to \u00015 kPa for a large\nslug and large widening (Figure 8f). As demonstrated in\nFigure 3, the onsets of the pressure waveforms show a high\ndegree of reproducibility between \u2018\u2018identical\u2019\u2019 experiments.\nHowever, in the case of long slugs where multiple slug\nbreakup events result in extensive turbulent wakes\n(Figures 5a and 8f), only average pressure magnitudes are\nrepeatable at longer timescales.\n[28] Although it is difficult to correlate the morphology of\nthe pressure signals among the different plots in Figure 8,\ncommon features can be identified and traced between\nexperiments when a more extensive experimental suite is\nconsidered. As an example, Figure 9 displays results\nFigure 6. Still images taken from digital video (a) without\nand (b) with the bubble nose ascending in a jet-like manner\nimmediately after slug disruption in the flare. Liquid\nviscosity is 0.1 Pa s, cross-sectional area change ratio,\n1:4.4, and the initial slug aspect ratio is 4.4. To the right of\nthe images, a sketch of the slug outline in Figure 6b is\ngiven. Note the unstable and dynamically controlled shape\nof the bubble nose as well as its irregular base, indicative of\nturbulence. The lower section of the original slug, still in the\nsmaller tube, also has an irregular but flat (rather than\ndomed) upper surface but retains its steady state base.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n9 of 25\nB05201\nobtained over a more complete range of slug aspect ratios\nincluding values intermediate between those illustrated in\nFigures 8a and 8d (for a cross sectional area ratio 1:1.7).\nThe rapid pressure change at the start of the static ramp at\n\u00011.7 s in Figure 8a for a \u2018\u2018small\u2019\u2019 slug is related to the onset\nof the pressure spike at \u00011.3 s in Figure 8d for a \u2018\u2018large\u2019\u2019\nslug. The small \u2018\u2018overshoot\u2019\u2019 transient at the top of the ramp\n(at \u00012.0 s in Figure 8a) corresponds to the more gradual\npressure \u2018\u2018overshoot\u2019\u2019 at \u00012.2 s in Figure 8d. Features\nassociated with the onset of the static pressure ramp\n(indicating the decreasing aspect ratio of the slug as it\nexpands sideways in the flare) and the return to a constant\nDC pressure (indicating the gas is entirely in the large\ntube, or has escaped from the liquid surface), can be\nobserved in all panels in Figure 8. Thus the overall\nmorphology of the pressure changes can be correlated\ndirectly with physical parameters such as slug size and\nmagnitude of the discontinuity.\n[29] Under viscous control, little oscillatory pressure\nbehavior and no apparatus displacements are recorded\n(Figure 10, compare to Figure 9b). The slow liquid speeds\ninvolved in these experiments simplify the correlation of\npressure measurements to physical flow processes\n(Figure 7a). Figure 10a shows the pressure recorded by\nASG 1 as a slug ascends from a small- into a medium-\ndiameter tube (cross sectional area ratio 1:1.7) without\nbeing broken up. The overall pressure increase (\u00011.5 kPa)\ndue to the change in static and steady dynamic effects is\nsimilar to that observed for the same tube geometry and slug\nsize in low-viscosity liquids (\u00011.3 kPa, Figure 9b). No\npressure change is detected as the slug nose enters the\nwidening at \u00010.7 s. The onset of decreasing pressure at 1.1 s\ncoincides with an observed increase in the downward-\ndirected liquid flux, marked by a thickening of the liquid\nfilm falling around the body of the slug. We interpret this\npressure decrease as due to the increased volume (mass) of\nliquid being viscously supported by the tube walls during\nthis film thickening and, therefore, not contributing to\nmeasured pressure at the base of the liquid column. This\nis consistent with any displacement of the apparatus being\nundetectable; the reduced downward force on the tube\nresulting from the decreased liquid pressure at its base is\nfully balanced by the added weight of the viscously sup-\nported liquid mass on the tube walls. When the increased\nflux in the falling film reaches the level of the slug base, the\nslug base accelerates upward and a steep pressure increase\nis recorded (interval 1.3\u20131.4 s in Figure 10a), reflecting the\nwall-supported mass rejoining the liquid column as well as\nslug geometry changes. A small-amplitude pressure pulse is\nmeasured immediately after this process, and is interpreted\nto be the result of a heavily damped oscillation as the bubble\nregains an equilibrium shape.\n[30] Figure 7a illustrates the sequence of bubble motions,\ntogether with ASG 4 pressure data, for a slug with initial\nL0 = 2.2 transiting through a flare with area ratio 1:4.4. In\nthis case, the widening is sufficient to induce a disruption of\nthe slug into two daughter bubbles. Figure 10b displays the\npressure response obtained when a larger slug with initial\nL0 = 4.4 ascends from a small- into a large-diameter tube in a\nhigh-viscosity liquid (compare with Figures 7a, 8c, and 8f\nunder inertially dominated conditions) yielding four daugh-\nter bubbles in two trains. Initially, the pressure trace is\nsimilar to that seen in Figure 10a, displaying a small\npressure decrease resulting from wall support of the thick-\nening liquid film after the slug nose entered the larger\ndiameter tube. The onset of the first pressure increase\ncorresponds to the apparent closing of the narrowing gas\nneck (see Figure 7a), which forms a detached bubble from\nFigure 7. The flow behavior of viscous controlled slugs ascending through a flare. (a) Slugs just\nsufficiently large (space-time field labeled 1) to break up within a flare generate two daughter bubbles\n(space-time fields 2 and 3). Slug shapes sketched from selected video frames are shown. (b) Longer gas\nslugs break up and generate many daughter bubbles, some of which coalesce before reaching the surface.\nThe space-time fields are labeled 1 for the parent slug and 2\u201320 for the daughter bubbles. Some of the\nbreakup events leave a new slug nose to form at a considerable distance below the flare, e.g., daughters 5\nand 17, which themselves become the parents for the next bubble train. Data points represent slug\nobservations from individual video frames, with open symbols representing the bubble\/slug nose and\nclosed symbols the tail. ASG 4 pressure data are shown by the irregular black trace, with the sensor\nposition given by the labeled dashed line.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n10 of 25\nB05201\nthe original slug nose. However, pressure immediately starts\nto decrease again as a second bubble begins to form directly\nbehind the first separated bubble, in the region originally\npart of the first bubble neck. Only when this second bubble\nhas detached from the remainder of the slug does pressure\nincrease again (at 14 s in Figure 10b) due to slug geometry\nchange. The small pressure steps at 20 and 27 s are due to\nthese two initial bubbles bursting at the surface of the liquid.\nThis symmetric double bubble detachment is repeated again\nat \u000140 s (Figure 10b) as the remainder of the slug passes\nthrough the flare. These same features can be identified in\nthe flow behavior of longer slugs (Figure 7b), where double\nFigure 8.

A0, the equivalent slug aspect ratio (L0, see\nequation (5)) for each slug (in the small and then the large tube), and the liquid viscosity, m, are indicated in\nthe upper left corner of each panel. With the exception of Figures 8c and 8f, the pressure increases\ndisplayed are dominantly due to the changes in static and dynamic pressures associated with the slug rising\nin a tube of increased cross-sectional area (equation (6)). However, even in these cases, significant\noscillation of the apparatus was observed in the sz data. In Figures 8c and 8f the dominant pressure changes\nare oscillations induced by the disruption of the slug within the flare. Figure 8c is the same experiment as\nthat seen in Figure 5c, where the ASG 4 pressure response and slug space-time field is shown.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n11 of 25\nB05201\nbubble detachment appears to precede the generation of\nmore complex bubble groups within the bubble train created\nas the slug traverses the flare.\n3.2.4. Oscillatory Sources\n[31] As demonstrated in Figure 8, the largest pressure\nchanges occur during slug breakup induced by a tube\nwidening with cross-sectional area ratio of 1:4.4 in low-\nviscosity liquids (e.g., Figures 8c and 8f). Large pressure\ntransients always occur at the beginning of the static\npressure ramp, although significant signals are also ob-\nserved at the end of the ramp for long slugs (Figure 8f).\nExamples of ASG 1, ASG 4, and sz data (derived from Fz)\nrecorded with this tube geometry and an L of 4.4, changing\nto 0.5 in the larger tube (similar to Figures 5c and 8c), are\ngiven in Figure 11a. The downward ramp in the ASG 4 data\n(also seen in Figures 5b and 5c) marks the interval during\nwhich the body of the gas slug is passing by this transducer\n[James et al., 2004], which is located just below the flare\n(Figure 1). Little change is recorded by this transducer as\nthe slug nose enters the flare (at 1.0 s). Within the temporal\nresolution of the digital video (0.04 s), the sharp onset of\nthe pressure transient observed at \u00011.3 s coincides with the\ntop portion of the slug becoming detached from the\nremainder of the ascending slug due to closure of the gas\nneck after passage of the slug nose through the widening\n(between sketches iv and v in Figure 11a). The frequency\ncontent of subsequent pressure oscillations at Pz 4 and\nPz 1 is illustrated in Figures 11b and 11c, respectively.\nThe spectrograms show three different frequency compo-\nnents: (1) a \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019-frequency component at \u000160 Hz;\n(2) a \u2018\u2018low\u2019\u2019-frequency component at \u00016 Hz; and (3) an\n\u2018\u2018intermediate\u2019\u2019-frequency component at \u000113 Hz, apparent\nmostly at Pz 1. Pz 1 also shows evidence of broadband\nsignal in the initial transient.\n[32] Considering the \u000113 Hz oscillations first (which\npersist throughout the Pz 1 data, Figure 11c), we note that\nthis is the natural resonant frequency of the entire spring-\nsuspended apparatus resting on the force transducer. This\ncomponent is, therefore, likely to reflect pressures induced\nin the fluid by vertical resonant oscillation of the surround-\ning apparatus on its springs. This is verified by examination\nof the phase relationship between the pressure recorded at\nthe base of the apparatus (Pz 1) and the apparatus accel-\neration. Figure 11d shows that both pressure and acceler-\nation data display persistent, in-phase 13 Hz oscillations\nwith slowly decaying amplitudes. This phase correspon-\ndence confirms that apparatus motion is responsible for\ninducing the observed liquid pressures, whereby an upward\nacceleration of the apparatus increases the liquid pressure at\nthe base of the tube, which in turn accelerates the liquid\nFigure 9. Variation of pressure recorded by ASG 1 (black traces) and apparatus displacement, sz (gray\ntraces), during the ascent of gas slugs of different sizes in a tube with fixed cross-sectional area increase\nratio 1:1.7. These results demonstrate how the seemingly different pressure waveform shapes in\nFigures 8a and 8d are related, with the slug length increasing in the order of Figures 9a, 8a, 9b, 9c, 8d,\nand 9d. Note the elevated background levels of resonant apparatus oscillation stimulated by the turbulent\nwake in the longest slug (Figure 9d).\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n12 of 25\nB05201\ncolumn upward (\u2018\u2018following\u2019\u2019 the apparatus). Further sup-\nport for this mechanism is found in the greatly reduced\namplitude of the 13 Hz component at Pz 4 (see spectrogram\nin Figure 11b), reflecting the reduced head of fluid above\nthis transducer [James et al., 2004]. Accordingly, in-phase\npressure and acceleration data are the result of the\napparatus\u2019s mechanical response to an initial vertical per-\nturbation and, as such, this 13 Hz frequency component is\nspecific to our apparatus and we do not consider it to be\npart of a \u2018\u2018source\u2019\u2019 process.\n[33] In contrast, the high-frequency components of the\npressure and acceleration data present during the first \u00010.1 s\n(approximately six cycles) of the oscillatory transients\ndemonstrate a clear out-of-phase relationship (inset of\nFigure 11d). This out-of-phase correlation is consistent with\nan acceleration of the apparatus being driven by changes in\nliquid pressure (i.e., elevated fluid pressure acting on the\nbase of the tube accelerates the apparatus downward). The\nhigh-frequency, \u000160 Hz component thus represents a fluid-\ndriven process distinct from the resonant mechanical re-\nsponse of the apparatus. Details of the high-frequency\nonsets of the pressure transients recorded at different levels\nin the tube are shown in Figure 11e. The onset of the\nsharpest pressure change occurs during the time interval\nbetween the last video frame in which the body of the slug\nis still joined to the bulbous nose entering the flare by a\nnarrowing neck (sketch iv), and the following frame, in\nwhich the closing of the gas neck has separated the slug into\ntwo bodies (sketch v). Transducers Pz 4 and Pz 5 (see\nFigure 1 for position) detect pressure changes almost\nsimultaneously (Figure 11e), suggesting that the source\nevent occurred somewhere between these two transducers.\nPressure sharply decreases at Pz 5, and sharply increases at\nPz 4. The decreased pressure in and above the tube\nwidening (Pz 5 and Pz 6) reduces the vertical component\nof force exerted by the liquid on the flare shoulder. As a\nresult, the apparatus begins to accelerate upward as\nindicated by the \u0001sz trace at 1.29 s in Figure 11e.\n[34] Above the flare, Pz 6 detects pressure change virtu-\nally simultaneously with Pz 5. With bubble-free water\nbetween Pz 5 and Pz 6, a pressure wave propagation time\nof \u00010.4 ms is expected for a sound speed of \u00011500 m s\u00061\nin water. This equates to two data points and represents the\ndetection limit for the logging rate used. Below the flare, the\nonset of pressure increase at Pz 3 occurs \u00013 ms after\nthe onset of pressure increase at Pz 4, consistent with a\ndownward-traveling wave propagating at \u0001200 m s\u00061. This\nis not an unreasonable sound speed (requiring only \u00010.4%\ngas bubbles by volume [Kieffer, 1977]) in light of the fact\nthat this region of the fluid includes the base of the slug and\nbubbles entrained in its wake. The onsets of the pressure\nwaveforms at Pz 2 and Pz 1 are slightly distorted by an\nupward-traveling pressure wave generated at the apparatus\nbase by the previously induced upward acceleration of the\napparatus (note the perceptible increase in pressure rise at\n1.29 s at Pz 1). After approximately one period of oscilla-\ntion, the piezo-transducer data are either in phase (Pz 2, Pz 5,\nand Pz 6), or out of phase (Pz 3 and Pz 4) with Pz 1,\nindicative of the excitation of a resonant standing wave field\nwithin the fluid column (Figure 11e). This phase relation-\nship is maintained during the following \u00010.1 s, pointing to a\nrelatively constant distribution of liquid and gas phases\nduring this time period. After \u00010.1 s the correlation\nbecomes difficult to observe, suggesting that changes in\nthe distribution of liquid and gas phases may have become\nsufficiently significant to suppress the resonance. The\ncomplex nature of the standing wave (with pressure nodes\nlocated between Pz 2 and Pz 3 and between Pz 4 and Pz 5)\nlikely reflects the heterogeneous composition of the reso-\nFigure 10. Pressure changes recorded by ASG 1 during\nthe ascent of gas slugs through a flare under viscous control.\n(a) A relatively short gas slug rises through a small diameter\nincrease without breaking up. Onset of the sharp pressure\ndecrease (1.1\u20131.3 s) corresponds to observed increases in\nthe downward liquid flow rate into the top of the smaller\ntube as the slug nose enters the wider-diameter tube. The\nreduced pressure is therefore interpreted to reflect the\nincrease in the amount of liquid being viscously supported\non the walls of the flow tube. When the increased liquid\nflow reaches the base of the slug, pressure rapidly increases,\nand the slug base accelerates upward into the upper tube.\n(b) Data for a gas slug ascending through a severe diameter\nincrease (compare with Figure 7). In this case the slug is\nbroken up in the transition to the larger-diameter tube,\nforming two daughter bubbles above the flare during the\ninterval 10\u201314 s (which reach the surface at 21 and 27 s)\nand repeating the process near \u000140 s.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n13 of 25\nB05201\nFigure 11\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n14 of 25\nB05201\nnating body resulting from the spatially varying ratios and\ndispersions of gas within the liquid column. If one assumes\nthe 60 Hz represents a simple organ pipe resonance, then a\nwave velocity of 200 m s\u00061 (estimated from the initial\ndownward-traveling pressure transient) yields a half wave-\nlength of \u00011.7 m. This is consistent with the dimensions of\nour fluid column. We therefore attribute the short-lived\n\u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019-frequency (\u000160 Hz) component to an acoustic\nresonance within the fluid column.\n[35] This resonance is excited by a trigger event located\nbetween Pz 4 and Pz 5, and occurs within the period of\ninitial slug disruption. Under conditions of no slug disrup-\ntion in the flare (when a liquid piston was not formed),\nclosure of the liquid annulus at the base of the slug\nproduced a substantial broadband pressure pulse of duration\n\u000120 ms, and peak-to-peak amplitude \u000110 kPa (Figure 5b).\nThis pulse duration is close to the period (\u000117 ms) of the\nhigh-frequency resonance observed when the slug is dis-\nrupted in the flare (Figure 5c). The trigger mechanism for\nthe high-frequency resonance could, therefore, be the rapid\nradial deceleration of liquid in the annulus at the point of\nclosure; a process that must take place in both cases.\nHowever, differences between the no slug disruption and\nslug disruption cases such as initially decreasing pressure\ntransients within and above the flare during disruption\n(Figure 11e), in contrast to initially increasing pressures in\nthe absence of disruption, indicate that there certainly are\nfurther complexities involved.\n[36] The low-frequency (\u00016 Hz) component in the spec-\ntrograms of Figures 11b and 11c has a duration of <0.2 s, or\napproximately one period, suggesting that this is either a\nheavily damped resonance, a resonance with period similar\nto the timescale of changes in liquid-gas distribution, or is\nnot a resonance at all. In other experiments, this component\nwas observed over two to three periods, suggesting reso-\nnance might be playing a role. The short duration and\nproximity of this frequency to the resonant frequency of\nthe apparatus (\u000113 Hz) prevent an accurate determination\nof the phase relationship between pressure and apparatus\nacceleration and make identification of its origin difficult.\nHowever, the similar amplitudes recorded at ASG 1 and\nASG 4 (compared to the amplitudes of the 13 Hz signal, in\nthe spectrograms of Figures 11b and 11c) suggest that it is\nprobably not due to the mechanical response of the appa-\nratus, but is a direct result of fluid processes.\n[37] Figures 11b and 11c show that the high- and low-\nfrequency components emerge quasi-simultaneously, raising\nthe possibility that they are stimulated by the same physical\nprocess, that is the closing of the gas neck and formation of\nthe liquid piston. However, the order of magnitude differ-\nence in frequency suggests that the oscillatory processes\ninvolved are not likely to be similar. With the high-\nfrequency component attributed to acoustic resonance, a\npossibility for the low-frequency component might be an\ninertial oscillation of the liquid. Here, we propose that this\ndepicts the motion of the liquid perched on top of the newly\nformed gas spring represented by the portion of the slug\nremaining in the lower tube. When the gas neck closes,\nmomentum in the descending liquid piston must compress\nthe underlying gas, exciting slug oscillation. This hypoth-\nesis is discussed further in the following section where the\nfrequencies and amplitudes predicted by such a model are\ncompared with recorded data.\n3.2.5. Amplitudes and Frequencies\n[38] Figures 8\u201310 provide an indication of the magni-\ntudes of pressure change that occurred in experiments\nfeaturing tube diameter flares. In viscosity-controlled sys-\ntems (Figures 7 and 10), the lack of significant rates of\nchange of liquid inertia implies that measured pressure\nchanges are reflecting only variations of static head and\nsteady dynamic pressure losses around the slug. When\nliquid inertia is important (Figures 5, 8, and 9) the ampli-\ntudes of pressure transients can exceed these pseudo-static\npressure changes and represent a significant fraction of the\nabsolute static pressure. Peak pressure amplitudes measured\nat the base of the apparatus demonstrate complex variations\nwith parameters such as slug size, believed to result from\nvarying degrees of constructive interference between oscil-\nlations generated by different processes.\n[39] For small slugs that do not break up (L0 < 3.3, or L <\n12.5 cm in the smallest tube used), the liquid piston never\nforms, and the fluid processes believed to generate the\nlargest pressure changes (<25 kPa) do not operate, even\nthough, under inertial control, dynamic pressure pulses\n(<10 kPa, Figure 5b, interpreted to be due to the deceler-\nation of slumping liquid) are larger than the static pressure\nsteps (<2 kPa, Figures 7 and 10, dominantly due to\nincreases in liquid head) produced under viscous control.\nThe largest oscillatory pressure changes were recorded at\nASG 4 and Pz 4 (Figures 5 and 11) when slugs ascended\nFigure 11. Pressure and displacement transients induced by slug disruption during slug ascent through a severe flare in a\nlow-viscosity fluid.

(c) Same as Figure 11b for Pz 1 data. Both data sets from Pz 4 and Pz 1 show dominant\nfrequency components at \u000160 and \u00016 Hz. Pz 1 data also indicate an additional long-lived component at \u000113 Hz, attributed\nto oscillation of the apparatus. (d) Comparison of band-pass-filtered (2\u2013100 Hz) Pz 1 data (black trace) and apparatus\nacceleration (gray trace, calculated from the sz data). The lower-frequency (\u000113 Hz) oscillations in the signal coda are in\nphase, while the initial, higher-frequency (\u000160 Hz) oscillations are clearly out of phase (see inset). These phase\nrelationships indicate that the 60 Hz signal represents liquid pressures moving the apparatus, whereas the 13 Hz signal is a\nresult of apparatus motion inducing pressure changes in the liquid column (see text for detailed explanation).

After the first period of oscillation, in which the progress of a downward-traveling pressure\nwave can be observed (Pz 4 to Pz 1), data from the piezo transducers appear to maintain constant in-phase or out-of-phase\nrelationships.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n15 of 25\nB05201\nFigure 12\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n16 of 25\nB05201\nthrough a 1:4.4 area-ratio flare in low-viscosity liquids.\nFigure 12a shows the maximum amplitude of the pressure\nfor the high- and low-frequency components of the initial\noscillatory pressure transients as a function of L for the two\nliquid viscosities 0.1 Pa s and 0.001 Pa s. With sufficient\nflow distance for the thickening liquid annulus to close, the\namplitudes of the resulting pressure oscillations reach a\nmaximum for both viscosities. The 10 kPa pressure pulse\napparent in Figure 5b (L0 = 2.2) as the liquid annulus closes\ndoes not appear to contribute to either the high- or low-\nfrequency components in Figure 12a. This is consistent with\nthis pressure pulse being broadband in nature and the\nabsence of suitable physical conditions for it to excite\nresonance. The peak oscillation amplitude in Figure 12a\ncorresponds to the smallest-sized slug (L0 = 3.3) that\nunderwent disruption within the flare. Maximum bubble\nnose velocity (Figure 5c) and apparatus displacement\n(Figure 8c) also occurred under these conditions. In this\ncase, only a small portion of the original slug remains in the\nlower, narrower tube after the slug nose has become\ndetached, and a recognizable secondary slug nose never\nforms (Figure 5c). Pressure changes are larger under full\ninertial control (viscosity 0.001 Pa s), compared with flows\nunder mixed viscous and inertial control (viscosity 0.1 Pa s).\nWith increasing slug length, maximum initial transient\namplitudes appear to approach a near constant value of\napproximately 1 kPa in both high- and low-frequency\ncomponents.\n[40] Figure 12b shows the dominant frequencies associ-\nated with the high- and low-frequency components as a\nfunction of L0. The high-frequency component displays a\nstrong frequency decrease with increasing slug size for 3.3 <\nL0 < 7. This is thought to reflect the increasing amount of\ngas and entrained bubbles below the flare, which signifi-\ncantly decreases sound speeds (and hence also frequencies)\nwithin the fluid column. This interpretation is supported by\nan observed slowing of the initial downward-traveling\npressure pulse with increasing slug size. The absence of\nhigh-frequency component at small L0 values in the 0.1 Pa s\nliquid may indicate a viscous damping of the trigger\nmechanism (the point of closure of the liquid annulus),\nwhich otherwise excites the high-frequency signal, or an\nabsence of bubbles in the liquid to slow the sound speed\n[Kieffer, 1977] and produce resonant modes into which the\ntrigger can couple.\n[41] A readily distinguishable low-frequency component\nwas also not observed for relatively small slug sizes (L0 < 5,\nFigure 12b), presumably either as a result of the weakness\nof the excitation process or an absence of suitable condi-\ntions to sustain the oscillation. For larger slug sizes, the low-\nfrequency component shows a systematic decrease in fre-\nquency with increasing slug length, and the high-viscosity\ndata consistently plot at lower values than the low-viscosity\ndata. In order to assess the validity of our hypothesis that\nthis component represents an oscillation of the gas slug\nremaining in the lower tube, we use the formula for the\nlongitudinal oscillation of liquid \u2018\u2018bouncing\u2019\u2019 on a gas slug\n[Vergniolle et al., 1996]:\nfL \u00bc 1\n2p\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ngPg\nrLeqHl\ns\n; \u00f07\u00de\nwhich was successfully used to model gliding experimental\npressure oscillations by James et al. [2004]. Here, g is the\nratio of specific heats of the gas (g = 1.3 for air), Leq is the\nequilibrium bubble length, Hl is the depth of the slug in\nthe liquid, r is the liquid density and Pg is the gas pressure\nin the slug. Figure 12c compares the experimental data with\nequation (7), in which we use Pg = 105 kPa, r = 1000 or\n1250 kg m\u00063 and Leq is expressed in terms of slug aspect\nratio. Leq values are calculated as the original slug aspect\nratio (given on the abscissa) minus 3.3 \u0006 the approximate\n\u2018\u2018size\u2019\u2019 of the first bubble produced when the slug is\ndisrupted in the flare - and hence represent the sizes of the\ngas slugs remaining in the lower tube after the first liquid\npiston has formed. For each viscosity, a value of Hl is\nobtained that provides a best fit model to the data. In\nequation (7), the values of Hl correspond to liquid depths\nwithin a tube with the same diameter as the gas slug. To\naccount for the flare in our application, we convert these\nvalues into equivalent liquid depths in the larger-diameter\ntube, to yield depths of 0.05 m (0.001 Pa s) and 0.06 m\n(0.1 Pa s). The reasonable model fits displayed in Figure 12c\nsupport the hypothesis that these low-frequency signals\noriginate in the natural frequency oscillations of a constant\n\u2018\u2018active volume\u2019\u2019 of liquid perched on the portion of the gas\nslug remaining in the lower tube. An indication of the\nsensitivity of this analysis can be obtained by assuming\nalternative values of Hl. The dashed lines in Figure 12c are\nFigure 12. (a) Amplitude and (b) frequency of fluid-driven oscillatory pressure changes recorded at ASG 4 during the\nascent of gas slugs through a flare with 1:4.4 area change ratio, separated into high- and low-frequency components. Only\nexperiments carried out in intermediate- (0.1 Pa s) and low-viscosity (0.001 Pa s) liquids produced results suitable for\ncomparison, and these results are plotted as functions of the equivalent slug aspect ratio L0 (see equation (5)) of the slug in\nthe lower, smaller tube. In Figure 12a, each symbol represents an average of five experiments and, where the range of the\ndata exceeds the symbol size, this range is given by the error bars. The dashed line portions of the plot in Figure 12a\nrepresent data for which a dominant frequency component was not observable (see Figure 12b), and the pressure change for\nthese cases represents a maximum amplitude within suitably band-passed data. (c) Comparison of low-frequency\ncomponent data (key as for Figure 12a) with a slug oscillation model. Black curves are for 0.001 Pa s data, and gray curves\nare for 0.1 Pa s data.

Model results assuming much larger\n(dotted curves) or smaller (dashed curves) oscillating liquid volumes (see text for details) are also shown for comparison\nwith best fits.

Different slug aspect ratios are vertically offset for clarity.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n17 of 25\nB05201\nresults obtained for a depth of 0.04 m, representing the\napproximate height of liquid in the lower tube which is\nabove the remainder of the gas slug, while the dotted lines\nare results for a depth of 1.33 m, equivalent to the full\nvolume of the liquid in the upper, larger tube. Neither of\nthese depths provides a reasonable fit to the data. The size\nof the \u2018\u2018active volume\u2019\u2019 is likely to be determined by the\nabsolute and relative sizes of the tubes on either side of the\nflare, as well as the fluid properties. For the liquids used\nhere, viscosity does not appear to have a significant\ninfluence on the size of the \u2018\u2018active volume\u2019\u2019 and the\nnumber of oscillatory cycles observed (1\u20133) provides a\ntimescale over which the resonant fluid distribution is\nstable. Note, however, that this model does not take into\naccount the presence of the overlying bubble and is thus\nsignificantly simpler than the real scenario.\n[42] A further test of the applicability of this model is to\nalso consider the amplitude of the pressure oscillations. The\npotential energy, Ep, for small oscillations of a gas spring is\ngiven by Vergniolle et al. [1996] as\nEp \u00bc 1\n2\npR2gPg\nLeq\n\u0006 \u0007\nDL\u00f0 \u00de2; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere R is the radius of the gas spring (R \b 1\/2D) and DL is\nthe length change during oscillation, which, assuming an\nideal gas, is proportional to the peak-to-peak magnitude of\nthe pressure change in the slug. The smooth upper curves in\nFigure 12c are fits of this equation to the ASG 4 data (for\nL0 > 5) based on optimal values for Ep (0.023 J for\n0.001 Pa s and 0.016 J for 0.1 Pa s). For L0 < 3.3, the curves\ncannot be made to fit the data and the model is not\napplicable, in agreement with observations that there is no\nslug disruption below the flare. For 3.3 < L0 < 5, we assume\nthat the \u2018\u2018gas spring\u2019\u2019 model is inadequate to fully represent\nthe complex situation when only a relatively small volume\nof gas is involved or the appropriate value of Ep has\nchanged. Therefore both frequency and amplitude data are\nconsistent with the \u2018\u2018bouncing\u2019\u2019 of an \u2018\u2018active volume\u2018\u2018 of\nliquid on a gas spring.\n[43] It is interesting to note that a particular pressure\ntransient or frequency component could not be directly\nattributed to the jet-like ascent of the bubble nose, observed\nshortly after slug disruption. With the upward flux of gas\nbeing necessarily matched by a volumetrically equivalent\ndownward flux of liquid, significant pressure changes\nwould intuitively be expected during this process. We\nhypothesize that the timescale over which this occurs\n(\u00010.2 s) is too similar to the period of the low-frequency\ncomponent of pressure oscillation to enable these processes\nto be identified individually. It is possible that the first\noscillation of the low-frequency component of pressure is\nrelated to the jet-like bubble ascent process or, alternatively,\nthat the jet-like ascent is induced by pressure changes from\nthe underlying slug oscillation. Band-passed pressure data\nfrom ASG 1 (Figures 12d and 12e) point to the presence of\nfurther, longer-period (\u00010.3 \u2013 0.7 s), low-magnitude\n(\u00011 kPa) pressure changes. These timescales are too long to\nbe directly resulting from the interval of jet-like ascent, but\nrather are believed to reflect overall pseudo-static pressure\nchanges, and hence give a global indication of the period\nduring which the slug transition through the flare occurs.\nFigures 12d and 12e also further emphasize the repeatability\nof the events and demonstrate howparameters such as relative\nslug lengths could be obtainable from the data.\n[44] Experiments carried out with different heights of\nliquid above the widening (up to \u00010.6 m) did not display\nstrong variations in the overall magnitude of the pressure\nchange or dominant frequency of the source, when the\nliquid level was greater than approximately one diameter\ndeep in the upper tube (Figure 13a). This supports the\nprevious suggestion of an effectively constant \u2018\u2018active\nvolume\u2019\u2019 that has approximately equal depth and diameter.\nHowever, detailed observation of data band-passed in order\nto isolate the low- and high-frequency components does\nindicate some changes when the liquid depth is less than\n0.3 m (Figures 13b\u201313e). Note that initial source transients\nremain robust, although the waveforms diverge at later\ntimes.\n3.2.6. Process Overview\n[45] Our interpretation of the sequence of events respon-\nsible for exerting net vertical forces on the apparatus during\nslug breakup precipitated by a flare and under inertially\ndominated conditions (Figure 5), is, therefore, as follows.\n[46] 1. As the slug nose enters the flare, the change in the\nliquid flow field around it induces a small-magnitude\nupward force on the apparatus (Figures 8, 9, and 11a).\n[47] 2. The slug nose expands horizontally into the wider-\ndiameter tube and an increasing liquid flux begins to flow\ninto the top of the smaller tube, forming a narrowing neck in\nthe slug (Figure 5).\n[48] 3. This process continues until the narrowing slug\nneck finally closes (Figure 5a, sketch v), temporarily halting\nthe upward flow of gas into the flare. The point of closure\nacts as an impulsive trigger mechanism, which produces a\nsubstatic pressure above it, and a superstatic pressure pulse\nbelow (Figure 11e).\n[49] 4. Coupling of the substatic fluid pressure to the\napparatus at the flare accelerates the apparatus upward\n(Figure 11e).\n[50] 5. When the downward-traveling superstatic pressure\nwave reaches the base of the tube, the apparatus accelerates\ndownward (Figure 11e). The initial upward distance trav-\neled by the apparatus reflects the magnitude of the pressure\ndecrease in the flare and the time taken for the high-pressure\npulse to reach the base.\n[51] 6. These pressure perturbations stimulate a longitu-\ndinal standing wave within the fluid column (the acoustic\nhigh-frequency component of the pressure signal in\nFigures 5c, 11b, and 11c), which is terminated as the gas\ndistribution changes over the timescale of one cycle.\n[52] 7. At the closure of the narrowing slug neck in (3),\nthe liquid involved forms a downward-moving liquid \u2018\u2018pis-\nton,\u2019\u2019 which then decelerates on the gas spring represented\nby the remainder of the slug in the small tube. Ensuing\nlongitudinal slug\/piston oscillations appear to be manifested\nin the low-frequency inertial component of the pressure\noscillations (Figures 11b and 11c). These are terminated as\nthe remainder of the slug ascends into the flare.\n3.3. Tube Bulge\n[53] Experiments were also carried out using a combina-\ntion of widening and narrowing elements with a length-\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n18 of 25\nB05201\nlimited segment of enlarged tube in between. The observed\nflow patterns can be described as sequences of the above\ndocumented processes. When slugs were disrupted within\nthe flare, the resulting bubbles then coalesced within the\ndiameter reduction. Varying the distance between the\nregions of diameter change did not appear to have a\nsignificant influence on the flow processes observed.\n[54] Examples of pressure traces obtained in experiments\nwith back to back concentric reducers - the shortest length\nbulge used - are shown in Figure 14. For long slugs flowing\nFigure 13. Pressure changes as a function of liquid depth for a slug ascending through a flare. (a) The\namplitude of the maximum pressure change recorded at ASG 1 at the base of the apparatus varies little\nonce the liquid depth is greater than approximately one tube diameter (marked by the vertical dotted line).\nThe scaled gray image demonstrates the tube geometry relative to the plot data. (b\u2013e) More subtle\npressure variations are displayed by band-passed ASG 4 data. The solid lines represent data (averages of\nfive experiments each) for liquid depths of \u00010.25 m and greater. The long-, intermediate-, and short-\ndashed lines show data for liquid depths of \u00010.2, 0.1, and 0.03 m, respectively, corresponding to the\nsymbols in Figure 13a. Systematic variation of the pressure traces with liquid depth are observed in the\ndata collected for these \u2018\u2018shallow\u2019\u2019 liquid depths.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n19 of 25\nB05201\nthrough small changes in diameter, pressure changes char-\nacteristic of the slug nose entering the expansion\n(Figure 14b, 1.9 s; compare with Figure 8a, 1.8 s), slug\nflowing up the wider section (Figure 14b, 2.5\u20132.8 s), and\nslug gradually entering back into the narrower tube\n(Figure 14b, 2.8\u20133.6 s; compare with Figure 4b, 1.5\u2013\n2.0 s) were recorded. For severe changes in tube diameter\n(area ratio 1:4.4), pressure oscillations displayed amplitudes\nand frequencies similar to those observed for a tube wid-\nening (compare Figures 8c and 14c), with the effects of the\ntube narrowing being small on this scale. Therefore both\nphysically and fluid dynamically, the bulge can be consid-\nered to comprise a tube widening followed by a tube\nnarrowing. Note the absence of any static pressure offset\nin Figure 14, unlike those observed in Figures 4 and 8\u201310,\ndue to the slug geometry being identical above and below\nthe bulge discontinuity.\n[55] Changes in the vertical separation distance between\nthe two bulge shoulders did not result in any significant\ndifferences in the pressure amplitudes recorded (Figures 15a\nand 15c). This is consistent with an \u2018\u2018active volume\u2019\u2019 of\napproximately equal height and diameter. However, shorter\nbulges could not be investigated due the physical nature of\nthe concentric reducers used in the apparatus, which con-\nstrained effective bulge lengths to be equal to, or larger than\nthe bulge diameter (Figure 1b). Consequently, the \u2018\u2018active\nvolume\u2019\u2019 was always smaller than the bulge volume.\n[56] For more detailed comparisons of the low- and high-\nfrequency components, band-passed ASG 4 data are given\nin Figures 15a and 15c. The high-frequency components\n(acoustic resonance within the liquid column) from the\ndifferent tube geometries are indistinguishable (Figure 15a),\nindicating that this component is affected little by geometry\nabove the widening bulge shoulder. For the low frequencies\n(Figure 15c), onsets remain very similar, suggesting that\nsource processes between bulges and single flares are\nrelated. Following the signal onsets in Figure 15c, differ-\nences emerge between the signals with higher pressures for\nthe bulge configuration. This may not be surprising if large-\nscale motion of gas and liquid above the flare is indeed their\nsource.\n[57] In contrast to the pressure data, comparison of\napparatus displacements point to significantly reduced ap-\nparatus oscillations generated by slug propagation through a\nbulge, e.g., an amplitude of \u000125 mm in Figure 14c,\ncompared with an amplitude of \u000185 mm in Figure 8c for\na single flare. Band-passed apparatus accelerations are\nshown in Figure 15b and 15d. As the corresponding\npressure magnitudes are similar during these experiments,\nthe differences in recorded accelerations between bulge and\nflare configurations point to the importance of tube geom-\netry in determining how the pressure changes couple to the\napparatus to drive apparatus motion. The apparatus is\nmoved upward by superstatic pressure pulses coupling to\ndownward-facing tube wall, and substatic pressure pulses\ncoupling to upward-facing tube wall. Downward motion\nresults from substatic pressure pulses acting on downward-\nfacing wall, and superstatic pressure pulses on upward-\nFigure 14.

In the case of a symmetrical bulge the forces\napplied to the tube cancel out, leaving only the dynamic\npressure acting on the base to move the apparatus. There-\nfore the apparatus motion is expected to be less for the\nbulge than for the flare.\n4. Volcano-Seismic Implications\n[58] To assess the implications of the laboratory slug\ndisruption dynamics (summarized in Table 1) for volcanic\nprocesses inferred from seismic data, laboratory observa-\ntions must be scaled to relevant field values. However, due\nto the transient nature of the observed processes, traditional\nscaling arguments based on dimensionless numbers cannot\nbe rigorously applied. Initially, it should be determined\nwhether significant liquid accelerations or decelerations\nare to be expected, or whether the transient-free and\noscillation-free results observed in high-viscosity experi-\nments (\u000130 Pas) represent a more relevant scenario. With\nno direct scaling for the geometry change transition, we\nconsider the dimensionless parameters provided for steady\nstate slug ascent in the different-sized tubes or conduits\n(Table 2) in order to ascertain the likelihood of significant\ntransients being produced. In the laboratory case, the low\nviscosity of water ensures that slug flow in both small and\nlarge pipes is inertially controlled. No significant differ-\nences exist between the flow-defining parameters for either\nsized pipe. In the volcanological case, the effect of higher-\nviscosity silicate melt is reflected in significantly smaller\ninverse viscosity (Nf) values compared to water (Table 2).\nThis suggests that liquid accelerations, and hence, seismi-\ncally measurable forces, might be reduced. Although this\nindicates that in a 2-m-diameter tube slug ascent is con-\ntrolled by both inertial and viscous forces (Fr < 0.345, Nf <\nFigure 15. Comparison of high- and low-frequency components of pressure changes produced by slug\nascent through single flares and length-limited expansions (bulges) in water. Each trace represents the\nband-passed result of data averaged from five experiments. Solid black lines are data for a single flare\nwith area ratio 1:4.4. Solid gray lines represent data for a short length-limited expansion obtained by\njuxtaposing a flared section with area ratio 1:4.4 (Figure 1b) with an identical, but inverted (A0 = 4.4:1),\nflared section. Dashed black lines show data from a similar tube geometry, but with a 0.2 m long section\nof 0.08 m diameter tube separating the flare and inverted-flare sections. Data have been band-passed to\ndisplay the (a, b) high-frequency and (c, d) low-frequency components of ASG 4 pressure (Figures 15a\nand 15c) and apparatus acceleration, \u0001sz (Figures 15b and 15d). Pressure changes are very similar for all\ntube geometries, with length-limited bulge segments providing extended low-frequency oscillations. In\ncontrast, apparatus accelerations differ significantly, with much greater accelerations being produced by\nthe single flare geometry. Note also that the onset of the high-frequency component of acceleration is\nupward for the single flare and downward for the length-limited expansions.\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n21 of 25\nB05201\n200), in a 5-m-diameter tube, inertial effects dominate (Fr \b\n0.345, Nf > 200). If the relevant process to be considered is\nrapid liquid flow from the larger pipe into the smaller one,\nthen the increasing relative importance of viscosity within\nthe smaller pipe could possibly enhance rather than reduce\nthe likelihood of significant transient effects.\n[59] For an estimation of the magnitude of the forces\nproduced, we perform an order of magnitude calculation\nusing simple geometric estimates. In our experiments, net\nforces on the apparatus can be estimated by considering the\nrecorded vertical accelerations. Acceleration amplitudes of\nup to 1 m s\u00062 were recorded (e.g., Figures 2 and 11d),\nwhich, for the apparatus mass of \u000130 kg, imply forces of up\nto \u000130 N. On the basis of our interpretation of the\nexperimentally generated force being the result of the\ndeceleration of a volume of liquid, one may then estimate\nthe equivalent volcanological force by scaling the liquid\nmass by both density and volume (or cubic length). Given\nthat silicate magmas are roughly two to three times denser\nthan water, and also that volcanic conduit dimensions are\napproximately two orders of magnitude larger than the\nlaboratory tube dimensions, the scaling factor is \u00012.5 \n\n106. Applying this to the observed force of 30 N suggests\nthat a force of 10 to 100 MN could be realized in a\nvolcanological system. If this acted along a conduit 2 m\nin diameter, it would imply pressure increases of order 1\u2013\n10 MPa. As this analysis does not account for the viscosity\nor compressibility of bubbly magma, it is likely to represent\nmaximum values. Nevertheless, it demonstrates that the\nprocesses observed in our experiments may be capable of\ngenerating similar magnitude forces and pressures to those\nrequired by Chouet et al. [2003] to explain their VLP data\nfrom Stromboli and similar pressures to those suggested by\nVergniolle [1998] from acoustic data recorded at Stromboli.\nNo other previously suggested process (e.g., foam collapse,\nslug ascent up straight conduits) has been demonstrated\ncapable of producing pressures and forces of such magni-\ntudes without requiring an initial (and unaccounted for)\noverpressure at depth.\n[60] For further insights, the oscillation periods involved\ncan be considered, which, for VLP events, are some 50 times\nlonger than the periods of laboratory pressure oscillations,\ndue to the larger conduit dimensions and greater magmatic\nfluid volumes. Vergniolle et al. [1996] demonstrated that\nlongitudinal oscillations of gas slugs near the surface at\nStromboli could explain acoustic frequencies of 0.5\u20131 Hz.\nHere, we examine whether applying a similar model for\nslug disruption could produce reasonable parameters for the\nseismic events generated at depths of 220 and 260 m as\nrecorded by Chouet et al. [2003].\n[61] Should the VLP seismic signals at Stromboli result\nfrom a process equivalent to a liquid piston bouncing on a\ngas spring, then the work done to compress the gas can be\nequated to the potential energy lost by a magma column of\nheight H and cross sectional area A, assumed to fall a\ndistance s, before coupling to the gas.

First, a minimum value of DPg may be obtained by\nconsidering the volume change associated with the initial\ndike inflation phase calculated by Chouet et al. [2003]\n(\u0001100 m3). Assuming a penny-shaped dike with radius\na \b 100 m requires an average aperture increase, Dw, of\n0.3 cm to account for a volume expansion of 100 m3. For a\npenny-shaped crack subjected to a uniform distribution of\ninternal pressure, the excess pressure, DP, necessary to\nproduce this expansion, is given by [Sneddon and\nLowengrub, 1969]\nDP \u00bc 3p\n4a\nm l\u00fe m\u00f0 \u00de\nl\u00fe 2m\n\u0002 \u0003\nDw; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere l and m are the Lame\u00b4 coefficients of the rock matrix.\nAssuming l = 2m with elastic shear modulus m = 7 GPa\n[Chouet et al., 2003], we obtain DP = 0.4 MPa. Note that\nthis approach may significantly underestimate the excess\npressure in the process envisioned at Stromboli, which may\nbe more accurately described by a pressure transient applied\nover a small patch of crack wall in a vertical fluid-filled\ncrack open to the surface and under an initial static gradient\nof pressure.\n[63] As an alternative approach, a maximum value of DPg\nmay be estimated from the \u0001100 MN downward-acting\nsingle force calculated by Chouet et al. [2003]. Assuming\nthat this force is the result of an isotropic source of excess\npressure applied at depth within a nearly enclosed system,\nthen DPg can be calculated by estimating the liquid free\nsurface area over which the pressure did not couple into the\nsurrounding rock. This may be taken as the cross sectional\narea of the vent or cross sectional area of the dike imaged at\nStromboli if the liquid level is sufficiently low. Choosing a\nvalue between 10 and 100 m2 (representing a vent radius of\n\u00012\u20136 m or a dike with aperture of 1 m and width 10\u2013\n100 m) yields DPg \b 1\u201310 MPa. This approach is again\nlimited by the fact that the dynamics associated with the\nevent are not represented and any complications in sub-\nliquid surface geometry are neglected.\n[64] Assuming the upper 20 m of the conduit are magma-\nfree, with r = 2600 kg m\u00063 we obtain Pg = 5.1 MPa for a\nmagma depth of 200 m, or Pg = 6.1 MPa for a magma depth\nof 240 m. Our experiments suggest that appropriate values\nof s are on the order of the (upper) tube diameter. Using s =\n1 m appropriate for a dike aperture at Stromboli, and fL \b\n0.3 Hz derived from Figures 9 and 10 of Chouet et al.\n[2003], we obtain Leq \u0001 80 m for DPg = 0.4 MPa, and Leq \u0001\n3.5 m for DPg = 10 MPa. Slug lengths of a few tens of\nmeters are plausible (and have been estimated from acoustic\nmeasurements at Stromboli [Vergniolle et al., 1996]), sug-\ngesting that slug disruption is a possible mechanism for\nexciting shorter-period (\u00013 s) components of the VLP\nsignals observed at Stromboli by Chouet et al. [2003].\nThe corresponding heights of the \u2018\u2018active volume\u2019\u2019 are 6\nand \u0001140 m respectively, which would represent masses of\n50\u20131100 tons. Unlike our experiments, where the active\nvolumes appeared to be relatively equant, these suggested\nheights are significantly larger than the assumed dike\naperture. Although this may indicate that the slug breakup\nmechanism is not applicable to Stromboli, the details of the\nphysical process of slug breakup are difficult to assess for a\ndike-like conduit geometry and, given the rough nature of\nthese estimates, we tentatively conclude that this particular\nprocess cannot be rejected a priori. Invoking the slug\ndisruption mechanism for periods appropriate to the LP\nband (0.3\u20131 s) would imply slug lengths of \u00010.3\u201315 m and\nassociated oscillating masses of \u000110\u2013600 tons.\n[65] For the longest periods (15 s) of the VLP events\nrecorded by Chouet et al. [2003], slug lengths of \u00011000 m\nare required for small values of DPg, although for DPg =\n10 MPa slug lengths of \u000150 m are implied. These results\nsuggest that both LP and VLP sources could result directly\nfrom the slug disruption mechanism under appropriate\nconditions. However, this would require large dynamic\noverpressures to explain the longest-period signals. Alter-\nnatively, the longest-period components of VLP events at\nStromboli [Chouet et al., 2003, Figure 3] may originate in\nmechanisms that are distinct from those generating the\nshorter-period (\u00013 s) components. If the 3 s period compo-\nnents are due to slug disruption, the longer periods could\nrepresent the overall timescale of the slug transition through\nthe geometry change, as indicated in Figures 12d and 12e.\nThe absence of 15 s period components in type 1 events at\nStromboli [e.g., Chouet et al. 2003, Figure 3] may signify\nthe proximity of the liquid surface to the discontinuity, in\nwhich case bursting of the bubble or slug would curtail the\nduration of the signal and mask other pseudo-static pressure\nchanges. These conditions are represented in experiments\nwhere the liquid surface was so low that the bubble nose\nreached the surface during the period of jet-like ascent. In\nthese cases, bubble burst was usually associated with an\naudible \u2018\u2018pop\u2019\u2019 and liquid droplets being propelled \u00010.5 m\nup the tube, representative of a significantly more energetic\nevent than \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 slug bursts. Similarly, at Stromboli, the\ntype 1 events (without a 15 s VLP component) were\nassociated with \u2018\u2018cannon-like blasts\u2019\u2019 a few seconds long,\nin contrast to type 2 events which were much less impulsive\nand lasted longer (up to 20 s) [Chouet et al., 2003]. This is\nalso in harmony with the relative source depths ascertained\nby Chouet et al. [2003], which suggest that the centroid of\ntype 2 events is \u000140 m deeper than that of type 1 events.\n[66] Our canonical apparatus geometry may be relatively\nrepresentative of conduits entering lava lakes but is\nexpected to be very much simplified with respect to most\nother relevant volcanological settings, where generally dike-\nlike geometries are envisaged. In spite of such limitations,\nour experiments demonstrate pressure and single-force\nevents that are scalable in magnitude, and similar in\nB05201 JAMES ET AL.: GAS SLUG ASCENT\n23 of 25\nB05201\nrepeatability, to seismic sources recorded at low magmatic-\nviscosity volcanoes [Rowe et al., 1998, 2000; Aster et al.,\n2003; Chouet et al., 2003]. The process of small-volume\nliquid slumping and rapid liquid deceleration (in particular\nwhen this process occurs during the breakup of slugs in\nsevere conduit diameter expansions) has been shown to be\na viable seismic source. We anticipate that this general\nmechanism is likely to operate over a wide range of severe\ngeometry change styles and therefore could be responsible\nfor VLP and LP events in many other scenarios as well as\nslug flow into lava lakes. We thus propose the rapid\ndeceleration of downward-moving liquid as an alternative\ninterpretation of the source of some pressures and forces\ncurrently attributed in volcano-seismic analyses to repre-\nsent slower, upward accelerations of much larger liquid\nvolumes. Provided equivalent seismic events can be\nrecorded, increased understanding of the fluid flow mech-\nanisms involved may allow parameters such as conduit\ngeometry and slug size to be recoverable from VLP\nseismic data.\n[67] The complex spatial distributions of pressure\nchanges demonstrated in our experiments underscore the\nrequirement for detailed analyses of source space-time\nfunctions (including both moment-tensor and single-force\ncomponents) of relevant seismic data. Our experiments\nemphasize the importance of conduit geometry, not only\nin initiating transient fluid flow events, but also in dictating\nhow (and where) pressure fluctuations couple into the\nconfining medium as single forces. This is particularly\napparent in the \u2018\u2018bulge\u2019\u2019 geometry, where pressure transients\nare larger but apparatus accelerations are smaller than in\nflares, due to the axial symmetry in the tube geometry. For\nour experiments, examining bulk fluid momentum changes\nalone (as considered by current seismic analyses done on\npoint sources) would not yield the details necessary to\nreconstruct the overall source process. The single forces\nrecorded are a function of both the pressure changes\ninduced in the fluid and the timing of when these changes\ncouple into the apparatus. Consequently, apparatus motion\ndepends not only on when pressure changes are generated,\nbut also on the relative positions of the source and force-\ncoupling locations, as well as the effective sound speed of\nthe fluid between these sites. Hence inversions of seismic\nwaveforms may need to be carried out over a spatially\nextended source, rather than a point source, in order to fully\nexpress the source dynamics.\n5. Conclusions\n[68] The ascent of gas slugs through changes in tube\ndiameter generates a wide variety of complex pressure\nchanges. Severe increases in diameter can induce the\nbreakup of slugs and are responsible for the largest-\namplitude pressure signals. Where viscous control is dom-\ninant, rapid pressure increases and slower decreases occur\nduring slug breakup, but the net forces generated are\nnegligible. In liquids where viscosity does not completely\ndominate flow processes and fluid inertia is important, rapid\nmomentum changes in the liquid induce single forces on the\nconfining tube. Slug flow through conduit geometry\nchanges could, therefore, be responsible for the single-force\ncomponents of the VLP seismic signals produced by\nStrombolian explosions. However, it may be critical to\nconsider how, when and where, fluid momentum changes\ncouple to the conduit in order to fully understand single-force\ncomponents. In contrast to previous work (in which pressures\nand downward forces on conduits have been attributed to\nrelatively slow upward acceleration of large liquid masses),\nduring slug disruption in conduit flares the greatest pressures\nand downward forces are generated by the rapid deceleration\nof small volumes of downward-moving liquid.\n[69] The repeatability of recorded pressure data, and\ndependence of the magnitude of the pressure transient on\nparameters such as slug size, suggest that more direct links\nbetween moment-tensor and single-force representation of\nseismic sources and fluid flow processes are not only\npossible, but could potentially provide a wealth of infor-\nmation not available from seismic data alone. These\nresults provide strong support for further experiments\ncovering more styles of geometry change and continued\ninversions of relevant seismic data for more detailed source\nrepresentations.\n[70] Acknowledgments.
