The picture is complex and no \nclear lessons can be drawn from the analysis, except perhaps the counter-intuitive \npoint that a \u2018guilty conscience\u2019 may actually be more effective when the guilt in \nquestion is not attributable to the individual whose behaviour is affected.  This \npoint is made initially with respect to Chancellor Willy Brandt\u2019s 1970 apology for \npast German misdeeds, and reiterated with respect to Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s \n1999 response in Kosovo to the perceived failings of the previous British \nGovernment in Bosnia in the early 1990s.   \n \nIntroduction \nAs previous papers drawn from the series of workshops and panels sponsored by the \nEthics, Institutions and International Relations Network have demonstrated, discussion of \nmoral agency in relation to bodies such as states, intergovernmental organisations, non-\ngovernmental organisations, business enterprises and the like presents real difficulties, \nbut when the focus shifts to the notion of a \u2018delinquent\u2019 institution things become even \nmore complicated.1  Notions such as \u2018delinquency\u2019, \u2018blame\u2019 and, by extension, \n\u2018forgiveness\u2019 and \u2018guilt\u2019 engage the emotions as well as the intellect, and although the \nstrict separation between reason and the emotions characteristic of a great deal of \ncontemporary moral theory is now being challenged, partly in response to the revival of \ninterest in the moral world of the Classical Greeks, there are genuine problems posed by \nthis conjuncture.2  When the agency of human individuals is in question the emotions and \nthe intellect cannot be understood as wholly separate, but when the agency of institutions \nis at stake qualitatively different and more difficult problems are posed.   \n Notions of \u2018forgiveness\u2019 and \u2018guilt\u2019 are not necessarily emotionally laden.  Still, \nalthough it might be possible to think of the notion of \u2018forgiving\u2019 unemotionally \u2013 for \nexample, we speak of \u2018forgiving a debt\u2019 as synonymous with writing it off \u2013  generally to \nsay that we have forgiven somebody, or have been forgiven by somebody, suggests a \nchange in emotional states.  Similarly, we might think of \u2018guilt\u2019 as something that can be \nassessed dispassionately, for example by the verdict of a court, but guilt is also a state of \nmind, something that we feel (or do not feel).  We may be found guilty of a criminal \noffence without actually feeling guilty (because we did not do it, or because we do not \nthink \u2018it\u2019 should be a crime), and vice versa.  Guilt can also be \u2018existential\u2019 in the sense \nthat we may feel guilty about situations over which we have no control and for which we \nare not in any meaningful sense responsible; the approach to issues such as world poverty \nby cosmopolitan international political theorists and anti-globalization activists illustrates \nthe point here. \n\u2018We\u2019 in these sentence can be taken to signify private individuals, but some legal \nsystems allow corporations to be held criminally responsible for their actions, and here \nthe problem is posed more starkly.  It is certainly possible for such a delinquent \ninstitution to be found guilty of, say, corporate manslaughter (assuming such a crime is \non the statute book), but whether a corporation can feel guilt is another matter \u2013 and \n                                                   \n1   These Workshops have been supported by the British Academy, the Carnegie Council on Ethics and \nInternational affairs, the International Studies Association and the British International Studies Association, \nand have been reported in, inter alia, Toni Erskine (ed) Can Institutions have Responsibility: Collective \nMoral agency and International Relations (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003) and Ethics and \nInternational Affairs Vol.15 No.2, 2001. I am grateful to all the participants, and especially to Toni Erskine \nand Kirsten Ainley for their comments on an earlier version of this essay.   \n2  A key reference point here is the work of Martha Nussbaum, e.g. Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence \nof Emotions (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001) and The Therapy of Desire (Princeton: \nPrinceton University Press, 1994).   \n 2\nwithout feeling guilty, is it possible to ask for forgiveness?  A corporation or a state that \nis blamed for some action can be punished \u2013 by a fine, reparations or, in extreme \ncircumstances, by dismemberment or occupation \u2013 but it is the individuals who make up \nthe delinquent institution who feel (or perhaps do not feel) the emotional force of blame, \npunishment and the attribution of guilt.3  The effects of this disjuncture are not always \npredictable; thus, for example, the so-called \u2018war guilt\u2019 clause of the Versailles Treaty of \n1919 actually assigned responsibility to the German state for the outbreak of war in 1914 \nsimply to provide a legal basis for claiming reparations for war damage (and, \nincidentally, merely repeated similar clauses in previous Treaties, including those drafted \nby Imperial Germany) but for the German people this restrictive, legal notion of state \nresponsibility was translated into the emotional language of guilt, and deeply resented. 4  \nWhat began as a legal formality and a judgement on the foreign policy of the Wilhelmite \nReich, was translated in the minds of the German people (and some of their former \nenemies) into a an assertion of the collective guilt of all Germans, with serious \nconsequence for post-war politics. Some figures in the Social Democratic Party \nanticipated these consequences and tried to divert the resentment of Germans towards the \nregime of Kaiser Wilhelm II, but without much success \u2013  however one might rationally \ndefend Article 231, the emotional damage had been done and it simply did not prove \npossible to separate state, people and regime.5\n In short, the problem this dual nature of notions such as \u2018guilt\u2019 and \u2018forgiveness\u2019 \nposes is easy to see.  While it is certainly possible to argue that institutions possess \nagency, and thus it is only a relatively small step to suggest that they can possess moral \nagency, the idea that institutions are capable of an emotional response is much more \nproblematic \u2013 individuals who represent institutions are certainly so capable, but the \nrelationship between these warm bodies and the institutions they represent is complex \n                                                   \n3  See e.g. Hannah Arendt Responsibility and Judgement edited Jerome Kohn (New York: Shocken Books, \n2003) for an argument that guilt is exclusively an individual moral category.  \n4   The wording of Article 231 of the Versailles Treaty states that \u2018The Allied and Associated Governments \naffirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and \ndamage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a \nconsequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies\u2019..  \n5  See Karl Kautsky  The Guilt of William Hohenzollern London, 1920.  The idea that the Versailles Treaty \nwas unfair to Germany also came to dominate progressive opinion in Britain and the US, also with serious \nconsequences; nowadays historical opinion is a little kinder to the peacemakers of 1919 \u2013 see Margaret \nMacmillan Peacemakers (London: John Murray, 2003). \n 3\nand difficult to unravel.  Clearly institutions do not experience emotions in the literal \nsense of the term, but are there institutional equivalents to emotions that can be seen to \nexert influence on state behaviour?  This is a problem that is best approached through \nactual examples and that will be the strategy of this essay; the main focus is on British \nand American decision-making with respect to the humanitarian interventions of the \n1990s, but first it may be illuminating to reflect on what was, for someone of my \ngeneration, the most striking image of guilt and forgiveness of the post-war era, the \nactions of Willy Brandt in Warsaw, 1970. \n \nBrandt, head bowed, in the rain at the Warsaw Ghetto \n On 7 December 1970, (West) German Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt, in the course of \nan official visit to Poland to sign a treaty recognising the post-1945 boundaries of that \ncountry, knelt, head bowed, in the rain, in front of the memorial to the Warsaw Ghetto \nrising of 1943.6  The photographs of Brandt kneeling in a nondescript raincoat are deeply \nmoving, the acceptance of guilt and the plea for forgiveness are unmistakeable and \ncompelling \u2013 the square in which this event took place is now Brandt Square and has \nitself become a place of pilgrimage for visiting German statesmen.  Brandt\u2019s gesture is \nwidely seen as marking a key point in the post-war history of Europe, symbolising a \ncentral plank of his Ostpolitik, namely his understanding that the normalisation of East-\nWest relations could only take place on the basis of a reconciliation between Germany \nand its victims, and that a conscious acceptance of guilt by Germany had to be part of this \nprocess.7 More, and crucially, he understood that this could not be conveyed by words in \na speech or the text of a treaty; rather, an emotional gesture was necessary \u2013 whether his \naction was spontaneous or not is still debated, but is, I think, largely beyond the point. \nThe key issue is whether, or, perhaps, in what sense, Brandt could actually be \nseen as representing the German people, or \u2018Germany\u2019, when he knelt in the rain.  \n                                                   \n6  The much anthologised photograph of this event can be seen at http:\/\/germanhistorydocs.ghi-\ndc.org\/image.cfm?image_id=161 .  Brandt\u2019s was Time magazine\u2019s \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 in 1970  and the \ncitation for this award contextualises the events surrounding Brandt\u2019s gesture very well: \nhttp:\/\/www.time.com\/time\/poy2000\/archive\/1970.html  \n7  The willingness of Poland\u2019s Kaczynski twins to reopen old wounds over a relatively trivial issue at the \nrecent European Summit (June 2007) suggests that this reconciliation is still not complete \u2013 but then \nBrandt\u2019s gesture was related to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943, not the Polish Home Army\u2019s action in \nWarsaw of 1944, in other words was directed particularly towards Nazism\u2019s Jewish victims. \n 4\nCertainly, he held the constitutional position of head of government but, perhaps \nsignificantly, he was not head of state; it is normally the occupant of the latter role \u2013 \nwhich is seen as in some sense beyond partisan politics, rather than the former, which is \nnecessarily political in a partisan sense \u2013 who is taken to represent the nation as a whole.8  \nAs head of government Brandt was entitled to act as he did and the fact that, according to \none poll, 48% of Germans thought his gesture \u2018exaggerated\u2019, as opposed to 41% who \nthought it \u2018appropriate\u2019 is, in politico-legal terms, beside the point. 9  But it is not at all \nclear that this is beside the point when we look at the emotional dimension of his act, \nwhich implied that he was representing Germany in a much more than constitutional \nsense. The German Chancellor was not simply expressing remorse and asking for \nforgiveness on behalf of his government, but on behalf of \u2018Germany\u2019, the German nation \nand the German people.  \nInteresting and significant in this context was Brandt\u2019s personal history.  As a \nyoung SPD militant he had gone into exile during the Nazi years, and \u2013 as the more \nunscrupulous of his opponents never allowed the German people to forget \u2013 had returned \nto Germany in 1945 wearing an Allied (actually Norwegian) uniform.10  With this \nhistory, Brandt was the ideal representative of a Germany other than the Germany \nrepresented by the Nazis, the Germany of Goethe and Schiller, of Hegel and Kant, of \nBach and Beethoven.  Almost without exception, every contemporary commentary made \nthe point that Brandt was expressing a guilt that he did not personally share, asking for \nforgiveness for a crime that he had not committed \u2013 although whether Brandt himself \naccepted this description is questionable; he may well have felt that the history of \nGermany could not be parcelled up in this way into \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 elements and have \nseen himself as their heir to both darkness and light.  \nBut what is really striking is that it seems to have been precisely his personal \nstanding as an anti-Nazi that made his gesture acceptable to so many people.  His \npredecessor as Federal Chancellor, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, had actually been a member of \n                                                   \n8  This division is not present in political systems where head of state and head of government are \ncombined in one person, such as that of the United States; at times this presents problems \u2013 the mental \ngymnastics involved in extending respect to a symbolic figure who represents the nation, but whose \npolitical values one despises have often been witnessed in recent years. \n9  Cited from Time article, see fn 3. \n10  \u2018Willy Brandt\u2019 was actually a nom de guerre from the period of exile; he was born Herbert Frahm. \n 5\nthe Nazi Party between 1933 and 1945, serving in the Propaganda Ministry and requiring \ndenazification before being allowed to join the Christian Democrats after the war.  Here \nwas someone who really had something to apologise for.  Brandt\u2019s successor Helmut \nSchmidt had been a junior artillery officer in the Wehrmacht during the later years of the \nwar, and although he did nothing discreditable in that position, he was implicated in the \nhistory of those years in a way that Brandt clearly was not.  Logically, a gesture of \nrepentance and remorse from either Kiesinger or Schmidt ought to have counted count \nfor more than one from Brandt\u2019s because in both cases an element of personal \nresponsibility might plausibly have been seen to be present \u2013 but at an emotional level \nthere was simply something right about what Brandt did, and it seems unlikely that a \nsimilar action from Kiesinger or Schmidt would have had the same power.  Brandt could \nmake amends on behalf of the German people, this \u2018delinquent institution\u2019, it seems, \nprecisely because of the distance that existed between him and them; his innocence \nallowed him to represent their guilt.  The fact that personally he had nothing to apologise \nfor emphasised the \u2018national\u2019 quality of his gesture.  As an aside, the furore over Gunter \nGrass\u2019s recent admission that he served in the Waffen SS in the war makes a similar point \nin a different way \u2013 Grass\u2019s standing as someone who has always been keen to accuse \nothers of whitewashing the national past has been seriously damaged by the realisation \nthat he hid his own guilty secrets.  As with Schmidt, he (probably) did nothing criminal in \nthe war years but he must have believed, and probably rightly, that had he told the truth \nabout his wartime experiences, his castigations of others for their Nazi past would have \nbeen perceived as tainted, hence the deception. To act as the conscience of the post-war \nnation he needed to have clean hands.11\nReturning to the main line of argument, what all this highlights is just how \ndifficult it is to employ the language of guilt, blame and forgiveness in assessing the \nmoral responsibilities of institutions.  The particular focus of this essay is on the \nhumanitarian actions (and, especially, inactions) of the 1990s, and the core issue under \nexamination is whether, in deciding when to act and when not to act, the responsible \nstatesmen and women were influenced by emotional and\/or moral sentiments with \n                                                   \n11  Gunter Grass Peeling the Onion London: Harvill Secker, 2007.  In fact, of course, the deception actually \nis the  stain on his character since his behaviour in 1945 is (apparently) otherwise guiltless. \n 6\nrespect to their previous actions or inactions.  Is the notion of a guilty conscience \nappropriate here?  Intuitively, it is not wholly implausible to think that, say, the \nwillingness of Western leaders to go (almost) all the way in Kosovo in 1999 was partly \nshaped by a realisation that in earlier crises in the 1990s \u2013 in particular, in former \nYugoslavia and in Rwanda \u2013 they or their predecessors had failed to rise to the moral \nseriousness of the problem. Perhaps a guilty conscience led to a desire to make amends? \nBut intuition is not always a reliable guide in such matters    When we look at the history \nof this period things become very complex, and the kind of purity discernable in Brandt\u2019s \ngesture is hard to find.  It seems that, for the leading actor, the US, there were two \nnarratives of guilt in play in the 1990s, which sometimes interacted to cancel each other \nout.12\n \nBill  Clinton, Somalia, the Rwanda Genocide and the Wars of Former Yugoslavia \nIf there is one event in the 1990s that ought to have generated guilt and remorse, it is the \nfailure of those in a position to act to do anything substantive to prevent, or curtail, the \ngenocide in Rwanda in 1994, and so this is a reasonable starting point for a discussion, \nalthough, as will be noted below, it is not actually the beginning of at least some of the \nrelevant narratives.  Equally, it makes sense to start this story with the US reading of \nthese events, not because the US necessarily bears the most guilt for the genocide, but \nbecause it \u2013 and its leaders \u2013 have been more introspective about issues of guilt and \ninnocence than most of the other parties involved.   Samantha Power tells us that when \nPresident Clinton read Philip Gourevich\u2019s New Yorker articles on the Rwanda genocide, \nhe sent copies to aides annotated with comments such as \u2018Is what he\u2019s saying true?\u2019 and \n\u2018How did this happen?\u2019.13  Power describes Clinton\u2019s outrage as \u2018oddly timed\u2019 since he \nshowed no interest in the issue in 1994, but she also acknowledges that the genocide \nnever got near the top of the list of things with which the President was concerned on a \ndaily basis, and that there was never a full-scale staff conference on the subject, which \n                                                   \n12  Brandt was also contributing to two narratives, an overt external narrative concerning Germany\u2019s \nrelationship to its past victims, and a more tacit narrative about what it meant to be a German in 1970. but, \nas will become apparent, this is not really a parallel to the events of the 1990s. \n13  Samantha Power \u2018Bystanders to Genocide\u2019 The Atlantic Online taken from The Atlantic Monthly  \nSeptember 2001.

Moreover, the horrific nature of the things that were happening in Rwanda \nwere such that even those better informed than the President found it difficult to believe \nthat reports from that country were not exaggerated, especially when those who were in a \ngood position to know the true state of affairs, in particular the French, supported this \nthesis, arguing that both sides in a civil war were responsible for atrocities.14 This, \nincidentally, is an argument that was repeatedly used in Bosnia as well; but the fact that \nboth sides in a civil conflict are usually implicated in some kind of atrocity ought not to \nprevent us from recognising significant moral differences \u2013 the RPF in Rwanda never \nintended genocide, the Rwanda government and armed forces did; the Government of \nBosnia did not support ethnic cleansing as a matter of principle, its Serb opponents, \nsupported by Belgrade, did.  Returning to Rwanda, even today it is emotionally difficult \nto accept the truth of reports of terrible events that, with our intellect, we know happened.   \nIn any event, Clinton clearly felt the need to make amends in some way.  \nUnfortunately the method chosen did not exactly help those who would make excuses for \nhis earlier inaction. The terms of the \u2018apology\u2019 that later, in the course of a whistle-stop \ntour of Africa in March 1998, he offered during a stop-over lasting a couple of hours at \nKigali Airport, regretting that \u2018\u2026we in the United States and the world community did \nnot do as much as we could have and should have done to try to limit what occurred\u2019 \nhave attracted much criticism.15  Power is understandably scathing about this wording; \napart from the strange use of \u2018limit\u2019 rather than \u2018prevent\u2019 (with the apparent implication \nthat more limited atrocities would have been somehow acceptable) it implies that \nsomething, but not enough, was done, whereas in fact, not only did the US do nothing \nitself, it actually on occasion obstructed others who wished to act.  Still, for all the \nevasions there seems little reason to doubt that Clinton was, in fact, genuinely disturbed \n                                                   \n14  It should not be assumed that everyone was in good faith in this respect; Andrew Wallis argues \nconvincingly that the French government knew exactly what was going on \u2013 see Silent Accomplice: The \nUntold Story of France\u2019s Role in the Rwanda Genocide London: I.B. Tauris, 2006.  The French \nGovernment under President Sarkozy and Foreign Minister Kouchner is finally beginning to acknowledge \nits own responsibilities in this area.  See Le Monde 2 July 2007.  \u2018G\u00e9nocide rwandais : ce que savait \nl'Elys\u00e9e\u2019 . \n15  Apologies of this kind are usually defective in some respect.  For example, the famous 1998 and 2000  \n\u2018apologies\u2019 for past wrongdoing of the Catholic Church actually refer to \u2018sons and daughters\u2019 of the Church \nhaving done wrong, rather than the institution itself. \n 8\nand upset by what he read in Gourevich\u2019s articles.16  In any event, the interesting \nquestions are first whether a sense of guilt over Rwanda actually affected Clinton\u2019s \npersonal decision-making in the other crises of the 1990s, most particularly in the case of \nthe intervention in Kosovo of 1999 and second, whether Clinton\u2019s sense of guilt \n(assuming it to have existed) was personal, or the expression of a collective guilt \nattributable to the US as an international actor?   \nRephrasing this, and focusing on the second of these questions, we might argue \nthat in the context of the Rwanda genocide, the US Government could be described as a \n\u2018delinquent institution\u2019 which failed to act in accordance either with its own values or \nwith the, albeit rather vague, requirements of the Genocide Convention.17  The rather \nhalf-hearted request for forgiveness that President Clinton made in March 1998 could be \nseen as an acknowledgement of delinquency, but more impressive evidence of an \nacknowledgement of this status would be provided had the Administration behaved \ndifferently in later, analogous crises \u2013 to return to the Brandt example, it was precisely \nbecause he wanted Germany to be understood as a different kind of polity from that of \nthe Nazi years that his apology was made and accepted.  Can a similar kind of shift be \nseen in the US case?18  Unfortunately, the analogy does not hold because the history of \nUS reactions to humanitarian disasters in the 1990s does not begin with Rwanda; indeed,  \nUS inaction in Rwanda in 1994 is often associated with an obsession with the  costs of \nthe failed intervention in Somalia of 1992\/93.  Whereas Willy Brandt was able to situate \nhis gesture in 1970 in a narrative where he was apologising for an offence committed by \nan earlier generation, and with a view to preparing the way for policy shifts in the future, \nClinton in 1994 was already embedded in another kind of narrative, one not entirely of \n                                                   \n16 Also, it should be acknowledged that the Rwandan Government were less upset by the terms of his \napology that were Clinton\u2019s domestic critics;  President Paul Kagame\u2019s speech on the tenth anniversary of \nthe genocide is instructive here.  He accepted the apologies of the British, Belgians and Americans as a sign \nof their basic decency, while attacking the French, accusing them (accurately enough) of having financed \nand underwritten the genocide, and of refusing to acknowledge this fact, which led to a walk-out by the \nFrench Ambassador to Kigali.  \nhttp:\/\/www.gov.rw\/government\/president\/speeches\/2004\/07_04_04_genocide_speech.html  \n17  In 1994 it was widely believed that describing what was happening as a genocide would mandate action \n\u2013 hence the many evasions (\u2018acts of genocide\u2019 and so on).  But Darfur has been described as a genocide by \nthe US and other state actors, and, sadly, nothing has followed from this example of truth-telling. \n18  I stress again that I ask this question not in order to suggest that the US was the most guilty state in the \n1990s, but for the very different reason that the US leadership was the most introspective and thus opened \nthemselves up to an enquiry of this kind. \n 9\nhis own making, where more recent and immediate events bore down upon him. If failure \nto act in 1994 constituted delinquency and generated guilt and a desire for forgiveness, \nthis failure in turn can be partially explained in the context of guilt associated with an \nearlier failure, but this time a failure of commission rather than omission.    \nAnd here yet another complication muddies the water.  German guilt over its Nazi \npast focused on atrocities committed by Germans, but the guilty conscience experienced \nby US decision-makers over the Somalia debacle was not usually related to the failed \nintervention itself, and the fact that the Somali people were abandoned to anarchy, but to \na side-effect of this failure, the loss of the lives of American soldiers, and in particular the \n18 lives lost in the infamous \u2018Black Hawk Down\u2019 incident on 3 October 1993.  The loss \nof life here was obviously not on a very great scale, but there seems no reason to doubt \nthat it had quite a considerable effect on the political, if not the military, leadership of the \nUS.  The Pentagon saw this abortive mission as confirmation of their scepticism about \nthe whole enterprise (\u2018we do deserts, we don\u2019t do cities\u2019 was Colin Powell\u2019s mantra when \nChair of the Joint Chiefs) but were perhaps better equipped to place the loss of life in \nperspective than the predominantly civilian group who surrounded President Clinton, \nmost of whom, like their leader, had avoided military service and had genuine qualms at \nputting their fellow-citizen\u2019s lives at risk.  In this case putative US \u2018delinquency\u2019 was not \n(solely) related to its international obligations but to its responsibilities towards its own \ncitizens\/soldiers whom it had, allegedly, let down by placing them in harm\u2019s way without \nsufficient reason or a clear enough sense of mission .  In short, we have here a second \nnarrative of delinquency which privileges US citizens as the referent object, as opposed \nto privileging the international common good, as is the case with narratives that focus the \nGenocide Convention.   \nThe Somalia affair led to a recasting of US attitudes towards UN peacekeeping \noperations, exemplified by Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 25, a version of which \nwas released to the public in May 1994, that is to say right at the height of the Rwanda \ngenocide.  PDD 25 was widely read as making it much more difficult for the US to \ncommit troops to humanitarian interventions, and, as such, was seen as partially \nresponsible for the failure to intervene in Rwanda.  Still, although the substance of this \nproposition \u2013 that, for whatever reason, whether morally based or simply pragmatic, US \n 10\npolicy towards Rwanda was shaped by its experiences in Somalia \u2013 is widely cited in the \nliterature on humanitarian intervention it is, in fact, rather difficult to substantiate.  The \nevents of 3 October 1993 were certainly present in the minds of US (and UN) decision \nmakers, but David Halberstam in his authoritative history of the Clinton administration \nimplies that the events of 10-12  October 1993 at Port au Prince in Haiti were actually \nrather more significant.19  On 10 October the USS Harlan County arrived with \npeacekeeping US soldiers on board in response to a crisis caused by the exclusion of the \nelected president, Aristide, by a military junta headed by Raoul Cedras; rioting mobs at \nthe port prevented them from disembarking and, two days later, the Harlan County left \nwith its tail metaphorically  between its legs. It seems to have been this humiliation as \nmuch as events in Somalia that persuaded the Clinton administration not to become \ninvolved in Rwanda \u2013 although Haiti and Mogadishu were linked indirectly as the \ndockside thugs in Port-au-Prince taunted the US soldiers by chanting \u2018Somalia, Somalia\u2019.    \nBut although the Clinton White House may not have been much exercised by the  \nSomalia precedent (or by Rwanda at all), Madeleine Albright, then US Ambassador at the \nUN was obliged by her position to be concerned with the situation in Rwanda, and, \ninterestingly, she does refer explicitly in her memoirs to conversations with the parents of \nAmerican soldiers killed in Somalia, explaining her sensitivity to the parlous position of \nthe UNAMIR peacekeepers in terms of a desire to avoid a similar situation developing.20  \nHer discussion of the possibility of US involvement in a rescue mission to Rwanda also \nrefers to Somalia as a key factor, but in strictly pragmatic terms. She also argues that \nPDD25 precluded US involvement in such a mission.  In fact, while PDD25 certainly \nsuggested that the US should be circumspect in its future support of UN peacekeeping \noperations and only commit US soldiers if US interests were directly at stake (and then \nonly under US command), it specifically acknowledged that there were circumstances \nwhere these considerations could be overridden. Where \u2018[gross] violation of human rights \ncoupled with violence, or threat of violence\u2019 occurs and \u2018[The] political, economic and \n                                                   \n19  David Halberstam War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton and the Generals (NY: Touchstone Books, \n2002), pp 273-278. \n20  Madeleine Albright Madame Secretary: A Memoir (London: Macmillan, 2003) p. 150.  Generally, \nAlbright\u2019s memoirs are a good source for discussions of guilt and US foreign policy in the 1990s; her \nsensitivity to these issues seems to have been considerable, or in any event, considerably higher than \nPresident Clinton\u2019s. \n 11\nhumanitarian consequences of inaction by the international community have been \nweighed and are considered unacceptable\u2019 the US would support and if \u2018U.S. \nparticipation is necessary for (the) operation's success\u2019 participate in UN actions.21  Since \nall these conditions were met in Rwanda, US action there would have been perfectly \nconsistent with the Directive.   \nIt is, therefore, difficult to see that guilt over Somalia had much, if any, impact on \nClinton\u2019s thinking over Rwanda \u2013 but, shifting to a later point in this narrative, did guilt \nover inaction there influence his administration\u2019s policy in later humanitarian disasters in \nthe 1990s?  Again, Albright is interesting; she concludes her discussion of Rwanda by \ncommenting on the advance warning of the genocide that had been received, \nremarking\u2026\u201dNext time, I pray the world will listen and act, but I am far from confident it \nwill.\u201d 22 This sentence was written after she left office, and it is perhaps significant that \nthere is pretty much no further reference to Rwanda in her memoirs.23  The main \ninternational humanitarian issues that concerned Clinton in the second half of his \nPresidency (by which time Albright had become his Secretary of State) revolved around \nthe fate of Former Yugoslavia.  Here again, observers have argued that the West in \ngeneral dropped the ball, politically and morally, in the early part of the Yugoslav Wars, \nand although there was no official US acknowledgement that this was so to parallel \nClinton\u2019s near-apology to Rwanda, it might be that a sense of failure here combined with \nthe sense of failure over the genocide, lay behind the later willingness to act in Kosovo in \n1998\/1999.24\n                                                   \n21 Taken from Clinton Administration Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace Operations (PDD 25) \nBureau of International Organizational Affairs, U.S. Department of State, February 22, 1996.  Executive \nSummary.  This is selective quotation, of course, but Albright also selects \u2013 the point is that PDD25 could \nhave been read as underwriting a rescue mission if such had been on the cards, which it was not. \n22  Albright, p. 155. \n23  Her one substantial comment post 1994 is actually quite perceptive; in the course of discussing \npeacekeeping in Africa she remarks: \u201cThe lesson of Somalia was that [the UN] invited disaster when it took \nsides in a conflict.  The lesson of Rwanda was that the UN invited disaster when it heeded the lesson of \nSomalia.\u201d p. 452.  One wonders whether either of these lessons were actually learnt; in any event, the \nquotation makes a good essay title and exam question. \n24  A central point here is that the Clinton Administration believed, with some reason, that its record during \nthe Bosnian War, 1992-95 actually stood up to scrutiny, and that shortcomings in the Western response to \nSerb aggression in Bosnia could be attributed to the Europeans, especially the British.  Samantha Power (op \ncit) is less forgiving, but Brendan Simms Unfinest Hour (London: Penguin, 2002) is more sympathetic to \nthis position, as will be outlined below. \n 12\nAgain, the record here is somewhat unclear, but not generally supportive of the \nposition that perceptions of prior delinquency had much impact on policy.  What does \ncome through is that Milosevic\u2019s behaviour was seen as continuing a pattern established \nearlier, and so a political lesson does seem to have been drawn from past behaviour, but it \nis more difficult to see a process of moral learning in action here.  Halberstam\u2019s account \nof the run-up to the Kosovo War suggests that for most of the crisis the President was \nmore focused on his domestic concerns (especially, of course, the Lewinsky affair) and, \nin so far as foreign policy impinged in major way on his consciousness, it was in relation \nto Iraq not former Yugoslavia.  Halberstam argues that, in January 1999, only Madeleine \nAlbright actually wanted to see action to protect the Kosovars; other foreign policy actors  \n\u2013 Sandy Berger, National Security Adviser and the Joint Chiefs \u2013 were much opposed to \nbeing drawn into the Balkans.25  What shifted opinion was the Serb massacre at the \nvillage of Racak, which played the same role as the 1995 Serb massacres of Muslim men \nand boys in the \u2018safe area\u2019 of Srebrenica  in acting as a belated \u2018wake-up\u2019 call to the \nWest.  This allowed Albright, and her new ally, the NATO Supreme Commander in \nEurope, General Wesley Clark, to pull the US into a more active stance \u2013 but again, what \nseems to be going on is not any sense of US\/Western responsibility for the massacre, \nrather a sense that the West would be morally responsible if it allowed Milosevic\u2019s tactics \nto succeed. \nAlbright\u2019s memoirs are instructive here.  As UN Ambassador she did not have \nquite the detailed involvement in the Bosnian civil wars of Assistant Secretary and \nSpecial Envoy Richard Holbrooke, but she was quite closely involved in UN and US \nactions with respect to ending the conflict, and was clear about the lessons she drew from \nthese actions. Explicitly referring to Neville Chamberlain\u2019s policy of appeasement (with \nher Czechoslovakian origins amplifying her distaste for the Munich Agreement), she \nexpresses pride that \u201cbelatedly or not, we did come to the aid of the Bosnian people, to \ntheir benefit and ours.\u201d26  Later, when discussing the onset of the Kosovo conflict she \nremarks, on looking at photographs of the victims of a Serb massacre of Kosovars on 30 \nSeptember 1998, \u201c[I] thought again of my vow not to allow a repeat of the carnage we \n                                                   \n25  Halberstam (op cit) p. 409. \n26  Albright, p. 191. \n 13\nsaw in Bosnia. There, several hundred thousand people had been killed. In Kosovo the \ncurrent toll was several hundred.  For most it was not too late, but we had to summon our \nresolve.\u201d 27  That such resolve was summoned was largely due to Albright \u2013 with an \nassist from Milosevic himself, and, in a different way, from Tony Blair as will be \ndiscussed below \u2013 and what became to some known as \u2018Madeleine\u2019s War\u2019 was a tribute \nto her persistence and recognition of what was important.  Perhaps in this case an element \nof moral as well as political learning can be discerned, and certainly her emotions, her \nmoral sentiments, seem to have been engaged, as well as her critical faculties.  The reader \nwill, however, note that this is, again, a case of an individual\u2019s emotions being engaged \nand the extent to which the institution which she represents can be said to be expressing \nthese feelings is highly debateable, especially since she, unlike Willy Brandt, was not \nhead of government, much less head of state. \n \nTony Blair, Bosnia and Kosovo \nIn American narratives of the 1990s, the British are, for the most part, cast as bit-players \non the world scene.  This is broadly accurate, which is why this essay has focused on the \nUS Administration. Still, over Kosovo, Tony Blair probably did have some influence, and \nin any event his position is interesting because he represented a fresh face in 1998\/99.  \nPresident Clinton was in office for the final years of the Bosnian war as well as for \nRwanda, Haiti, Kosovo (and later East Timor) and the various intersecting narratives of \nguilt and innocence that can be constructed around the US record in these years all \nconcern his decisions and non-decisions or those of his subordinates.  Blair\u2019s Labour \ngovernment, on the other hand, replaced the Tories of John Mayor in May 1997 and thus \nhad not been in power in the early 1990s.  The most important figure of the \nadministration that had been in power was Major\u2019s longest-serving Foreign Secretary \nDouglas Hurd; his role in the Bosnian War was, and remains, deeply controversial.  Hurd \nbelieved, in essence, that the war was the latest manifestation of long-standing, basically \ntribal, animosities, and that the rest of the world would do well to avoid takings sides.  \nJames Baker, George H.W, Bush\u2019s Secretary of State, famously remarked early in the \n                                                   \n27  Op cit p. 388.  \n 14\nwars of Yugoslav succession that \u201cwe don\u2019t have a dog in that fight\u201d.28  Hurd preserved \nthat attitude for a long time after it was no longer morally acceptable, if it ever had been.  \nBrendan Simms in Unfinest Hour has set out the sorry story of how Britain between 1992 \nand 1995 consistently frustrated attempts on the part of the Americans (and, sometimes, \nthe French) to give assistance to the legitimate government of Bosnia in its struggles with \nSerb separatists backed by Belgrade.  Certainly this was a complex issue, the Bosnian \nGovernment were not entirely blameless, and Britain did have troops on the ground \ndelivering aid which the Americans did not \u2013 still, the defeatism and negativity of British \ndiplomacy in this period attracted criticism from many quarters, left and right, not least \nfrom the former Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, whose pugnacious instructs \nwould have served the country better on this occasion than Hurd\u2019s weakness and \nvacillation.  \n When the Labour Party came to power in 1997, the new Foreign Secretary, Robin \nCook, made great play with the notion of stressing the ethical dimension of foreign \npolicy, somewhat to the disgust of Downing Street, where Cook\u2019s position was regarded \nas gesture politics of the worst kind.29  Still, Blair was determined that his government \nwould not be seen as weak on foreign or defence issues \u2013 Labour\u2019s past anti-NATO, anti-\nEuropean Union stance and its nominal support for unilateral nuclear disarmament had \nbeen a major electoral liability \u2013 and he shared the view that Hurd and Major had not \nbeen ready enough to resist Milosevic\u2019s aggression in the early 1990s.  Kampfner makes \ngreat play of Blair as a resolute militarist, who fought five wars in six years.30 This is \nover-egging the pudding, but it is clear that Blair was prepared to be a very active and, if \nnecessary, forceful liberal internationalist.  During the Kosovo War he took it upon \nhimself to make the moral case for the war and somewhat irritated the Americans by \n                                                   \n28  Halberstam, op cit p. 46. \n29  See John Kampfner Blair\u2019s Wars (London: The Free Press, 2003) p. 15.  Kampfner\u2019s book is generally \nwell-researched, although his judgement on US politics is rather shaky, and it should be remembered that in \nLabour\u2019s own tribal wars, his loyalty is to Cook not to Blair. \n30  Operation Desert Fox, (1998),  Kosovo (1999), Sierra Leone (2000), Afghanistan (2001\/2) and Iraq \n(2003); since neither the first (air raids on Saddam) or the third (military support to the government of \nSierra Leone) can really be seen as \u2018wars\u2019 in any normal meaning of the term, while the British \ninvolvement in Afghanistan was fairly minimal, a certain amount of padding in order to make a point \nseems to have gone on here. \n 15\ncontinually raising the issue of the ultimate necessity to commit ground troops to the \nconflict if the bombing campaign failed.31   \n What is interesting from the perspective of this paper is that Blair actually comes \nmuch closer to the model of guilt-driven action than Clinton ever did, in spite of, or \nperhaps because of,  the fact that he was not personally implicated in the guilt in \nquestion.  Blair does seem to have believed that Britain had been a \u2018delinquent\u2019 state in \nits attitude to the Bosnian War, and seemed determined to expunge this blot on Britain\u2019s \nrecord, even though he had played no part in putting it there.32  Blair was, in effect, \nmaking amends for his Britain\u2019s past failings in not being prepared to oppose tyranny \u2013 \nhe had a \u2018guilty conscience\u2019 not with respect to anything he had done, but with respect to \nthings that his country had done (or, more accurately, not done).  Whereas he could have \ndrawn a line under the past and attributed all past errors to his predecessors (not an \nuncommon political stance) he chose instead to clear the record by action rather than \nrhetoric. The parallel with Brand\u2019s gesture is clear \u2013 albeit at the level of motivation \nrather than the overall moral significance of his action.  One should not overstate the \npoint \u2013 as always, there were obviously other motives involved in Blair\u2019s action as well \nas expiation, but acknowledging that this was so does not take away from the point that \none of his motives was to rectify past errors. \n There is another interesting point here \u2013 should past errors lead to attempts to \nrectify bad situations, or ought they actually to inhibit action?  If Tony Blair was partly \nmotivated over Kosovo by a desire not to repeat past mistakes, many of his critics seem \nto have read the same mistakes in a different way.  On the contrary, the point was made \nthat because Britain, or the US, or the West more generally, had not acted to restrain \nMilosevic in the past, they should not do so now \u2013 they had, in effect, lost the moral \nlicence to act because of their past conduct.  Similar arguments have been heard with \nrespect to the interventions in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 \u2013given its past \ncomplicity in supporting the mujahadeen in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and in giving aid to \n                                                   \n31  Alastair Campbell in his recently published diaries recounts a furious row between Blair and Clinton \nover this issue; The Alastair Campbell Diaries London: Hutchinson, 2007. \n32  Simms makes the case that Blair\u2019s policy over Kosovo was partly shaped by his sense that Britain\u2019s \nrecord in the earlier stages of the war of Yugoslav Succession had been ignominious. \n 16\nIraq in its war with Iran in the same period33, it was argued that it was hypocritical of the \nUS to make any kind of moral argument in support of the overthrow of the Taliban and \nSaddam.  Irrespective of the rightness or otherwise of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, \nthis seems to me to be a very bad argument; guilt ought, surely, to stimulate action not \nparalysis.  The argument that because one has done the wrong thing in the past, one \nshould not do the right thing now seems perverse.   \n \nConclusion \nWhere have these reflections taken us?  Not very far perhaps, although there are a few \ntentative generalisations that can be made.  First, while scholars after the event will focus \non some particular issue such as US policy towards the Rwanda genocide, at the time this \nwas only one of a great many issues on which Clinton was being briefed by his staff; \nperhaps it should have been highlighted, and occasionally an issue will indeed force all \nothers off the President\u2019s (or Prime Minister\u2019s) agenda, but most of the time the \nunceasing flow of events does not allow the top decision-makers to focus long enough on \nany particular subject to engage in deep introspection.  The inability to grasp this point, \nor to understand its significance, is one of the reason why academic and journalistic \naccounts after the event are so frequently critical of the moral sense of decision-makers.34\n Second, and even taking the time factor into account, it is pretty clear that notions \nsuch as blame and forgiveness actually played very little part in the way politicians \nthought about humanitarian issues in the 1990s.  They may have sometimes thought of \nother states as \u2018delinquent institutions\u2019 but rarely their own; only rarely did they, ask for \nor give, forgiveness and although they sometimes blamed others, they rarely blamed \nthemselves. There is no equivalent in this period to the grand gesture of Willy Brandt in \n1970 \u2013 the closest we come to this is the suggestion that in 1999 Tony Blair was, by his \n                                                   \n33  Actually, contrary to popular belief, the US did not give aid to Bin Laden, and the assistance to Saddam \nin the 1980s was mostly confined to sharing satellite intelligence \u2013 his actual war machine was made up of \nRussian and French arms, as an examination of the debris on the battlefield confirms \u2013 but the point stands. \n34  Popular fiction makes the same mistake.  In the, generally very instructive. TV series The West Wing, \nPresident Bartlett and his staff somehow always seem to be able to make the time to concentrate fully on, \nsometimes quite minor, crises.  Recently Dame Eliza Manningham Buller, then head of Britain\u2019s security \nservice, MI5, commented \"I wish life were like Spooks [the TV series] where everything is, a, knowable, \nand, b, solvable by six people,\" cited from The Sunday Times 12 November, 2006. \n 17\nsupport for action in Kosovo, making amends for the past sins of the British state, but \neven in this example, as acknowledged above, there are many other factors at work.    \n But, third, it would be a mistake to suggest that politicians and diplomats do not \nlearn from the past, and sometimes the things they learn are moral lessons to accompany \nthe political wisdom that reflecting on past errors may bring.  Madeleine Albright\u2019s \nmemoirs are, perhaps, an example of this, and provide an interesting contrast with \nDouglas Hurd\u2019s.35  Predictably neither Hurd nor Albright makes a big issue about the \nmistakes they made \u2013 memoirs are usually apologias rather than self-indictments \u2013 but it \nis in the nuances that differences can be found.  Hurd seems to have come out of his time \nin office with much the same set of ideas that he went in with, and he clearly still does \nnot understand why so many people still feel upset by the policies he pursued in Bosnia; \nAlbright, one feels, developed and matured in office and, importantly, this maturing did \nnot involve suppressing her obvious emotional responses to some of the crises she was \nforced to deal with.  At times this probably made her an uncomfortable person to work \nwith, and might even have contributed to mistakes, but if we are seriously concerned with \nthe moral responsibilities of institutions \u2013 as we should be \u2013 then sometimes an emotional \nresponse is the right response. \n Fourth, a conscious attempt to learn from the past may be institutional as well as \npersonal, but does not necessarily affect future behaviour, at least not in a positive \ndirection.  PDD 25 was an attempt to draw out the lessons of Somalia and it at least \ncontributed to later inaction in Rwanda.  The UN\u2019s Carlsson Report of 1999 on the \nRwanda Genocide was more self-critical of the institution, and of particular individuals \nincluding the by-then Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan, but, again, it is not clear \nthat behaviour was altered thereby.  The Carlsson Report was intended to shape future \nresponses to similar events, but, in practice, the day to day politics of the UN dominates \noutcomes. \n Final point; an emotional response is not necessarily engaged by personal guilt \nand a personal sense of the need for forgiveness.  Like Willy Brandt in 1970 with \nreference to the Nazi era, Tony Blair after 1997 does seem to have experienced a sense of \nguilt for Britain\u2019s misdoings in the early 1990s, even though by no stretch of the \n                                                   \n35  Douglas Hurd  Memoirs  (London: Little Brown, 2003). \n 18\nimagination could he be seen as personally responsible for these misdeeds.  There may be \na significant point of political psychology at work here; it is one thing to identify, regret \nand attempt to rectify one\u2019s country\u2019s past mistakes, but it is another thing altogether \nwhen the mistakes in question are one\u2019s own.  Moreover, the notion of a repentant \npolitician expiating past guilt by current action is not one that seems to be accepted by the \npublic at large.  Perhaps, paradoxically, it is only the innocent \u2013 those who are detached \nfrom an earlier period of delinquency \u2013 who can handle guilt and allow it to affect their \nbehaviour? \n  \nChris Brown \n \nLondon, Jan 2008 \n 19\n"}
