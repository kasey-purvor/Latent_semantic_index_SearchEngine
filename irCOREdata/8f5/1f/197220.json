The continuity of these ideas in the discursive \nconstruction of regional filmmaking in England is striking and can be mapped \nonto the political economy of the development of regional film policy and \npractice. But how can the notion of cinema as a cultural practice be \nunderstood under the changing contexts of the territorialisation and \ncommercialisation of film production in Britain?  \n \nThis paper looks at the development of film policy and practice in the English \nregions to assess this debate. It asks: how has the \u201eterritorialisation\u201f of film \npolicy and funding affected regional modes of film production? And further, \nhow is film as a cultural practice manifest in contemporary regional film \nproduction?  \n \nThe paper is divided into two sections. The first outlines the development of \nregional film policy and practice from the 1970s paying particular attention to \nthe model for regional filmmaking that emerged from the film workshop \nmovement and the changes in regional film policy instituted by the New Labour \ngovernment since 1997. After this broad historical framework has been \nestablished the second section analyses regional film policy and practice \nthrough a case study of the East Midlands region. \n \nIt is argued that while ideas concerning cinema as a cultural practice are still \npresent at a rhetorical level, commercial interests have become ascendant in \nregional film funding policy, restricting the space for creative autonomy that \nonce defined regional production sectors.  \n \nBiography \n \nJack Newsinger is completing a PhD Thesis at the University of Nottingham. \nHis research interests lie in post-War British independent film: specifically film \npolicy; filmmaking practice; documentary and the representation of the \nEnglish regions.  \n \nKeywords: regional film, film policy, UKFC, territorialisation, film workshop \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \nFilm Policy in Britain shares a dilemma in common with that for most other \nnational cinemas \u2013 the commerce-culture relationship. There is always a \nstruggle between the desire to build a viable sector of the economy that \nprovides employment, foreign exchange and multiplier effects; and the desire \nfor a representative and local cinema that reflects seriously upon society \nthrough drama. (Miller 2001: 44) \n \nThe English regions have carried a distinct \u201ecultural burden\u201f within British film \nculture: the site of a more indigenous, socially responsive and culturally \nrelevant cinematic tradition than the \u201emainstream\u201f, which has always been \nlocated in the \u201ecentre\u201f. This \u201eburden\u201f has a long cultural history - figured, for \nexample, in the \u201einto unknown England\u201f writing of the nineteenth century, some \nof the films of the British Documentary Movement formed in the 1930s, and the \nregional focus of the \u201eBritish New Wave\u201f \u2013 and has been redefined as ideas of \n\u201efilm as culture\u201f and the place of the regions in the cultural geography of the \ncountry have changed. Nevertheless it can be mapped onto the political \neconomy of the development of regionally-based film production sectors from \nthe 1960s. It was not until the late 1960s that regionally-based film production \nsectors began to develop in England, and within them distinctly regional modes \nof filmmaking practice that articulated cultural rather than commercial \naspirations for British cinema. Within the tension between commerce and \nculture that has been the recurrent feature of British film policy debate the \nEnglish regions have been firmly aligned with film as culture. \nNicholas Redfern has argued that British film policy has undergone a \nprocess of \u201eterritorialisation\u201f since 1997 and that \u201ethe regional is increasingly \nseen as the best scale at which to formalise film policy, the institutional \ninfrastructure, and the discourses surrounding the cinema\u201f, making the \n 3 \ntraditional centre-periphery model of the film industry redundant (Redfern 2005: \n61). This suggests a new relationship between the \u201ecentre\u201f and the regions in \nBritish film culture, and a new significance for regional film production sectors. \nAt the same time this process has been widely criticised for the perceived \ncommercialisation of regional film policy and practice: the transformation of \nregional film production sectors from sites of small-scale but culturally \norientated filmmaking practices to regional media economies that have adopted \nthe values and practices of the \u201emainstream\u201f film and television industries (for \nexample Harvey and Dickinson 2003). This paper looks at the development of \nfilm policy and practice in the English regions to assess this debate. It asks: \nhow has the \u201eterritorialisation\u201f of film policy and funding affected regional modes \nof film production? And further, how is film as a cultural practice manifest in \ncontemporary regional film production?  \nThe paper is divided into two sections. The first outlines the development \nof regional film policy and practice from the 1970s, paying particular attention to \nthe model for regional filmmaking that emerged from the film workshop sector, \nand its eventual incorporation into a devolved national framework for film \nproduction under the New Labour government since 1997. After this broad \nhistorical trajectory has been established the second section goes into more \ndetail through an analysis of contemporary film policy and practice in the East \nMidlands region. \nThe relationship of film policy to film practice \u2013 that between institutional \ndeterminants and creative agency \u2013 should be characterised as a tension that \nis to a certain degree dialectical. While the economics of regional film \nproduction (the availability of equipment and facilities, the availability of \n 4 \nproduction funding and the ideological position of the organisations that \nadminister it, etc.) place firm limits on the size, scope and character of \nproduction activity, at certain times grass roots groups have been able to \ninfluence, as well as being influenced by, institutions, subject to external \nfactors. This paper is concerned with how this tension has changed in regional \nfilm sectors. \n \nThe Development of Regional Film Policy and Practice \n \nThe particular structure of regional film sectors in England has its origins in the \nRegional Film Society movement of the 1950s and the establishment of the \nRegional Film Theatres (RFTs) by the British Film Institute (BFI) in the late \n1960s and early 1970s. In 1948 The Radcliffe Report recommended that the \nBFI should devolve its activities to areas outside London but it was not until \n1966 that the idea of RFTs was put into practice. By 1970 there were thirty six \nRFTs across the country operating on either a full or part-time basis and \nshowing programmes of films partly drawn from the European and art-house \nprogrammes of the National Film Theatre and partly in response to local \ndemand (BFI 1970). However, the significance of the RFTs goes beyond \nregional film exhibition. They provided a regional stake and voice within the \nstructure of the BFI. The annual Conference for Regional Film Theatres, started \nin 1979 as a way for the BFI to communicate with the RFTs and the Regional \nArts Associations (RAAs), provided a forum where issues specific to the \nregions could be advanced (BFI 1981). The RFTs were established in \npartnership with existing film societies and by enthusiasts and supporters, and \ntheir activities reflected the strength and character of their local film culture. \n 5 \nIncreasingly money made available was put to use beyond exhibition to fund \nother areas of film activity such as libraries, resource centres, and later, \nproduction workshops (Christie 1981: 7). At a local level the RFTs could \nbecome a centre for the filmmaking community and a space where independent \nfilm could be seen and debated, ideas shared and collaborations formed. While \nthis \u201epre-history\u201f contained the tensions that existed in the BFI more generally \nbetween an effectively conservative ideology of the appreciation of film \naesthetics and a growing concern with the social function of cinema, the crucial \npoint is that the basis for regional film production in England was formed under \nthe publicly funded film cultural remit of the BFI.  \nThe development of regional film production activity began in the late \n1960s as part of the film workshop movement. While the history of the regional \nfilm workshop movement has not received specific detailed academic attention \nit has been covered in relation to the \u201eBritish independent cinema movement\u201f or \n\u201eindependent sector\u201f. In Margaret Dickinson\u201fs account the origins of the \nmovement lie in London as a part of the general ambiance of leftist politics of \nthe 1960s and particularly the politics of the New Left. Small film collectives \nsought to use film as a tool for cultural struggle as part of wider political \nstruggles; part of a climate that increasingly placed emphasis on issues of \nculture and ideology within strategies for social change (Dickinson 1999: 35-\n41). \nThe first regionally-based film workshop to be established was Amber \nFilms, formed in 1968 in Newcastle. Other notable groups include the Sheffield \nFilm Co-op, formed in 1973 by filmmakers involved in the Women\u201fs Movement, \nLeeds Animation Workshop, 1978, Trade Films Workshop, formed in \n 6 \nGateshead in 1979, and Birmingham Film and Video Workshop, 1981. It is \ndifficult to fully gauge the number and levels of activity of regionally based \ngroups and individuals in this period: many of the smaller and less active \ngroups and individuals have left little trace. However, numbers certainly \nincreased as the 1970s wore on and accelerated into the 1980s as funding \nstructures expanded and technology became more affordable. With the \nexception of Bristol, activity was concentrated in urban centres north of London, \nparticularly Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds \nand Newcastle. In 1986 a report prepared for the BFI lists 105 active regional \nfilm workshops, more than twice the number based in London with the majority \nlocated in these cities (Marris 1986: 51-76). In 1981 a directory of independent \nfilm from the North East listed 125 films made by over thirty different groups \nand individuals in that area alone (York Film 1981: 66-68. See also Dickinson \n1999: 68-69). While the North East was particularly developed, if this level of \nactivity were of comparable scale in other regions it would suggest a vibrant \nregional \u201eunder-belly\u201f of filmmaking developing massively in a relatively short \nspace of time.  \nJulian Petley describes the features of the film workshop movement: \nAlthough in many respects remarkably heterogeneous, these groups did \nnevertheless exhibit certain common characteristics: for example, the desire to \nwork outside the political, aesthetic and economic constraints of the \nmainstream film and television industries; the attempt to establish an ongoing \nworking base, rather than simply being a loose grouping of free-lance \nindividuals; the avoidance of conventional organizational forms (eg the profit-\nseeking limited liability company) in favour of collective or co-operative modes; \nthe search for finance through non-market mechanisms such as arts grants or \nother forms of subsidy; a commitment to the local community, and to pressure \ngroups such as trade unions, feminist organizations and anti-racist bodies; the \nrealization of the importance of providing wide access to equipment and \nfacilities; and finally the stress on integrating production with distribution, non-\ntheatrical exhibition, and education. (Petley 1989: 6) \n \n 7 \nHe continues: \u201eAlmost all these groups, in their different ways, were interested \nin cinema as a social practice\u201f (Petley 1989: 6). To this end groups developed \nfilm production and exhibition practices that had a non-sectarian, leftist cultural \npolitics, intended to make a political intervention in one form or another. It is \nworth emphasising the heterogeneity that Petley notes: in terms of style, form \nand content. Amber, for example, made films firmly within the British \ndocumentary tradition and, in the 1980s, moved into feature-length films that \nexperimented with documentary and fictional practices, focussing exclusively \non working class communities in the North East. On the other hand the Leeds \nAnimation Workshop produced short animated films on social issues from a \nfeminist perspective. This demonstrates the degree of creative autonomy that \ncharacterised the regional workshop sector in the period. Regional film as a \ncultural \u2013 as distinct from a profit-motivated \u2013 activity was defined through these \nvalues and practices, and this ideological and operational model informed the \ndevelopment of regional film production sectors until the mid 1980s.  \nWhile funding for the regional film workshops remained relatively small it \nincreased steadily during the period. Perhaps more significantly, regional film \nas a cultural practice in the terms that Petley describes became embedded at \nan institutional level: the institutions that funded regional film production \nadopted, to a certain degree, the definition of regional film as a cultural practice \nthat was developed within the sector as a legitimate function of public funding. \nThis point is shown in the extent to which the regional film workshops won \nrecognition for their particular mode of production in the structures of the BFI \nand, most clearly, in the extent to which they were supported by the newly \nformed Channel Four from the beginning of the 1980s. For example, in 1981 \n 8 \nthe BFI described workshop practice as the \u201etrue \u201cNew British Cinema\u201d\u201f (BFI \n1981: v). Channel Four\u201fs Independent Film and Video Department allocated \none third of its initial budget of \u00a33m to workshop production, increasing funds \nand providing the opportunity for new audiences. As Four\u201fs publicity material \nannounced in 1982: \nChannel Four\u201fs funding of film workshops represents a unique cultural \npartnership between independent filmmakers, the Channel and the \nAssociation of Cinematographic and Television Technicians. It makes a \nsignificant contribution towards strengthening regional film culture from which \nthe Channel can confidently anticipate the emergence of a wide range of \nimaginative and unusual work. (Fountain 1982: 6)  \n \nAnd in 1986 the BFI assessed the sector in the following terms: \nNowhere else in Europe has this combination of elements been developed \u2013 \nthe creation of on-going independent film-cultural production institutions, \nworking in relation to specific communities, with non project-tied film-cultural \nfunding, and union agreement on the terms of access for material produced to \nnational broadcast television. As a unique pilot, it should be backed for many \nyears yet to see what kind of long-term results ensue. (Marris 1986: 40) \n \nThe degree of insulation from market forces that the sector established meant \nthat film form, style and content could be determined by concerns other than \nperceived marketability, and working practices organised other than a \nhierarchical division of labour. It is not hard to see the appeal of these \nstructures to those committed to cinema as a cultural practice.  \nHowever, the encounter with Channel Four represents the beginning of a \ncontradiction for the regional film workshops that became more pronounced as \nthe balance of power in this dialectic shifted during the 1980s and into the \n1990s. For example, even by 1984 Sue Aspinall could complain that  \nthe tendency has been for independent work to adapt to television norms, to \nbe presented in recognisable forms (i.e. the longer narrative feature, the work \nof an \u201eauteur\u201f), rather than for television to adjust to the practices of the \nindependent sector: non-standard running times, collective production, formal \nexperiment, an emphasis on ideas rather than production values. While many \nmore people are seeing \u201eindependent\u201f work, there is little sense that such \n 9 \nwork arises from political and aesthetic debates carried on among filmmakers, \nthrough film magazines and journals, and in film education. (Aspinall 1984: \n74) \n \nAs the regional film workshops helped Channel Four to fulfil its cultural remit, \nthe model of regional film as culture that had developed within the sector \nbecame destabilised, and the space for creative autonomy restricted.  \nConcurrent to this regional local authorities began to identify economic \nand social benefits to media development, particularly in the relatively deprived \nareas of the North and the Midlands. The first such organisation, in 1984, was \nthe The North East Media Development Council. Its 1985 feasibility study \njustified public subsidy for film thus: \nthere is a real possibility of creating jobs which can be counted in the \nhundreds, of enhancing the region\u201fs self-image and its power to communicate \nboth inside and outside its boundaries, of attracting new investment into the \nregion, and of building new technological skills among the region\u201fs workforce. \n(Cornford and Robbins 1991: 25) \n \nOther regions followed: for example a Comedia feasibility study \nrecommended that Birmingham City Council set up a Media Development \nAgency in 1987 (Comedia 1987), and a Manchester-based organisation \nproduced a similar report in 1989 (The Centre for Employment Research \n1989). The development of a \u201ecultural industries\u201f approach to regional film was \nuneven but steady. More radical workshop practice competed with film as \neconomic development and social empowerment. In 2000 New Labour \ncompleted this transition in regional film policy by restructuring the various \nagencies responsible for the economic protection of the commercial film \nindustry on the one hand and the subsidisation of film cultural production on \nthe other into the single agency of the UK Film Council (UKFC). \n 10 \nDemonstrating the ascendancy of the ideology of the \u201ecultural industries\u201f, the \nUKFC\u201fs conception is summed up in the following terms: \nFilm is a complex combination of industry and culture. Common to both are \ncreativity and commerce. For the purpose of this review we assume that \nindustry and culture are inextricably linked and, that, in public policy terms, to \nprivilege one over the other would be to the detriment of both. (UKFC 2000: 12) \n \nThe funding opportunities for regional film production that continued throughout \nthe 1990s became incorporated into a national bureaucratic but devolved \nstructure of regional film funding administered locally through nine Regional \nScreen Agencies (RSAs). These initiatives form a complex network of public \nand private agencies, partnerships and co-funding deals, tendering \norganisations and production companies, feature film development funds and \nshort film training schemes, intended to form an \u201eintegrated planning framework \nbetween the \u201ccentre\u201d and the regions, and between industrial and cultural \npriorities\u201f (UKFC 2000: 37). Within this structure the regions have retained the \n\u201ecultural burden\u201f through a residual link to the model for regional film production \ndeveloped in the workshop sector and a rhetorical association with film as \nculture, albeit expressed in language that reflects changes in the terms of \ncultural policy at the beginning of the twenty first century. For example, while \nthe Premier Fund, the UKFC\u201fs flag ship national funding scheme, concentrates \nsimply on the \u201eproduction of popular mainstream British films\u201f, the regional \nproduction funds, as well as being targeted towards \u201ecultural diversity\u201f and \n\u201esocial inclusion\u201f \u201eobjectives\u201f, \u201eaim to produce innovative work, provide new \nopportunities for creative risk-taking, bring new voices and new visions to the \nscreen and help build regional audio-visual economies\u201f. The regionally-based \nNew Cinema Fund is intended to support \u201einnovative filmmaker\u201fs, most \nespecially new talent\u201f and \u201eexplore new digital production technologies\u201f in order \n 11 \nto \u201eovercome the artificial separation of industry and culture\u201f. (UKFC 2000: 10, \n28, 27). As a DEMOS report puts it: \u201eThe Government and the UK Film Council \nlook to the RSAs to help capture the many facets of British communities.\u201f \n(Holden 2006: 20) \n The formalisation of the relationship between the \u201ecentre\u201f and the regions \nin contemporary film policy is the result of the success of the development of \nregional film production sectors through the model that I have outlined \ncombined with New Labour\u201fs ideological tendencies towards privatised public \npolicy more generally. It reveals two things: firstly the implicit recognition that a \ncommercially orientated and metropolitan film industry is incapable of producing \na film culture sufficiently in line with contemporary ideas of national identity; in \nterms of ethnicity, gender, and region. Second, the extent to which cultural and \ncommercial interests are taken to be equivalent functions of one another: the \nrejection of the idea of a tension between commerce and culture. Clearly this is \nsomething of a contradiction.  \nWith increased European funding for regional media development, the \ncontinued involvement of broadcasters and, in many areas, an increase in \ninvestment from outside productions there has been a steady development of \nregional infrastructures that are now better able to sustain commercial feature \nfilm production than ever before. There has been a massive growth in regional \nshort film production schemes which are now accepted as a way that \nregionally-based filmmakers can begin a career in the commercial industry, \nside-stepping the traditional London film school or long, industry apprenticeship \nroute.  \n 12 \nHowever, the apparent commercialisation of regional film policy has \nraised serious concerns among critics and filmmakers committed to cinema as \na cultural practice. For example, Holly Aylett has argued that \u201ein the English \nregions, as in film policy, we find a series of more or less unaccountable private \ncompanies receiving significant amounts of public money and claiming the \nauthority to direct every aspect of film culture.\u201f (Aylett 2004: 106) For Michael \nChannan: \nPart of the problem is the way that trade interests are organised at the level of \ncivil society, according to a regime that establishes the normal channels of \ncommunication with the state apparatus, and, not by accident, limits \nindependent voices to a token presence. (Channan 2004: 110) \n \nHow have these changes in the ideology, structure and organisation of regional \nfilm production funding affected regional modes of film production? \n \nRegional Film Policy and Practice in the East Midlands \n \nThe East Midlands makes a useful case study because of its relatively \nsuccessful record of film production. The development of film production activity \nin the region closely follows the pattern that I have outlined.  \nThe Nottingham Film Theatre opened in 1966, the very first in the first \nwave of the Regional Film Theatre movement of the late 1960s and early \n1970s. As was the policy of the BFI it was developed in partnership with local \nbodies, in particular the Nottingham Co-operative Film Society (Selfe 2007). \nDuring the heyday of workshop practice in the late 1970s and 1980s there were \nactive film workshops in Leicester, Nottingham and Peterborough. Between \n1981 and 1987 Leicester was home to the British International Super 8 Festival \n(part of a wave of 8mm short film festivals across Europe) organised by \nLarraine Porter. They showed low-budget experimental and avant garde work \n 13 \nfrom students and amateurs, as well as more established filmmakers (O\u201fPray \n1996: 19). The Leicester Independent Producer\u201fs Association later became \nLineout which, as well as providing training in video production and acting as a \nsupport network for local filmmakers, has organised an annual international \nshort film festival since 1997.  \nThe majority of media activity in the region has been based in \nNottingham. Film workshops active during the 1980s include the Other Side \nVideo Collective, Astrodam, Isthmus Productions, and notably the New Cinema \nWorkshop and Nottingham Video Project, which later became Intermedia Film \nand Video. Reflecting the national trend towards the incorporation of the \n\u201ecultural industries\u201f approach to regional economic planning the local authority \nbegan a strategy to develop the city as a media centre as early as 1987 \n(McIntyre 1996: 224). It is from this nucleus that the structure of film funding \nand production under the UKFC formed.  \nThere is a direct continuity between the film organisations that can be \ngrouped under the workshop umbrella during the 1970s and 1980s and the \nstructure of film funding and production as it developed up to 2000 with the \nformation of the UKFC and the RSAs, and this is shown in the transition from \nindependent film workshops to open-access workshops to small media \nproduction companies exploiting the influx of production finance for short and, \nto a lesser extent, feature films. Intermedia, for example, has produced a slate \nof short films and documentaries for various broadcasters and was the \u201edelivery \ncompany\u201f for the East Midlands\u201f region New Cinema Fund financed Digital \nShorts film scheme 2002-2004. In 1996 it produced Shane Meadows\u201f career \nstarting featurette Small Time, in 2002 Metin Huseyin\u201fs Anita and Me, in 2003 \n 14 \nChris Cooke\u201fs debut feature film One for the Road, and in 2004 it co-produced \nAnnie Watson\u201fs BAFTA nominated short Knitting a Love Song. Similarly, \nWellington Films has produced a score of shorts for broadcasters and the \nUKFC and moved into feature production with London to Brighton (Paul Andrew \nWilliams, 2006). Other organisations include Spool Films, the production arm of \nConfetti Studios which produced the UKFC\u201fs Digital Shorts scheme in 2005 and \n2006, The Pool in Lincoln and Threshold Studios in Northampton, both of which \nsupport community-based filmmaking projects with Threshold having worked in \nassociation with Warp Films on a First Light scheme for young filmmakers for \nthe UKFC.  \nReflecting substantial growth in the audio-visual sector, according to a \nSkillset census, in 2005 there were 2900 audio-visual organisations in the East \nMidlands employing around 8200 people, excluding freelancers. 91 per cent of \nthese organisations had less than five employees. However, most of this \ngrowth has been in television, radio, video games and internet companies. The \nfigures for film show more modest growth: there were 280 people employed in \nfilm production with a further 100 in post-production. Despite success at \nattracting inward investment both nationally and internationally in the form of \ntelevision and feature film productions (for example Pride and Prejudice [Joe \nWright, 2005], Tristram Shandy [Michael Winterbottom, 2005] and The Da Vinci \nCode [Ron Howard, 2006]) the region\u201fs infrastructure did not have any fully \ncommercial film production companies (Skillset 2005). This demonstrates the \ndependency of film production in the region on government subsidy. Despite \nthe apparent commercialisation of regional film production in ideological terms, \nin practice it operates on a semi-commercial framework, allocating public \n 15 \nmoney to subsidise the development of small media production companies and \nthe professionalization of regionally-based creative workers.  \nEM Media, the Regional Screen Agency for the East Midlands, was \nformed in 2001 through the merger of the different local agencies responsible \nfor film and media funding and production in the region that variously \nrepresented the cultural and commercial development agencies that had \ncharacterised the production sector previously: the East Midlands Screen \nCommission, the Midlands Media Training Consortium, the film staff from Arts \nCouncil England East Midlands and the East Midlands Media Investment Fund. \nIt was one of the first RSAs and is therefore more developed than many of the \nothers, having seven staff in 2002 rising to 24 in 2005. Between 2004 and 2005 \nthe organisation generated the largest income of any RSA, mostly through its \nsuccess at attracting money from outside the main support sources of the \nLottery and the UKFC\u201fs Regional Investment Fund for England (Holden 2006: \n9). Its production related investments have grown steadily; 36 in 2002 \/2003 \nwith a total value of \u00a3674000 to 153 in 2005\/2006 with a value of \u00a32.9m. EM \nMedia secured a further \u00a36m in funding from the European Regional \nDevelopment Fund (ERDF) in 2006 and launched the first regionally-based \nventure capital and loan fund. The same year EM Media partnered with Screen \nYorkshire, the RSA for the Yorkshire region, the two organisations seeking to \ndevelop an international presence (for example sponsoring an industry event at \nthe 2006 Cannes Film Festival) and jointly investing \u00a31.5m over three years in \nWarp X, a regionally-based low-budget feature film production initiative (EM \nMedia 2006). In many ways EM Media is an example of a successful RSA \nunder the terms of New Labour regional film policy. \n 16 \nAs EM Media has matured and established a significant presence its \nrationale and operation has confirmed the trajectory of regional film policy \ntowards commercialisation. For example, its research and development \nemphasises the elaboration of a business model and organisational structure in \nthe region through the gathering of market and sector intelligence, skills \ntraining, target identification and opportunity. EM Media\u201fs Action Plan for 2006-\n2007 identifies their role as to \u201eUndertake advocacy, stakeholder development \nand offer leadership in the sector, by actively raising the profile of film and \nmedia\u201fs potential contribution to and the benefits of the region\u201fs creative \neconomy\u201f (EM Media 2006: 9). At the same time EM Media\u201fs publications \nconfirm the presence of the \u201ecultural burden\u201f, at least at a rhetorical level. Its \nbusiness plan for 2005\/2006 reaffirms its commitment to \u201edevelop and sustain \nan innovative and distinctive media sector\u201f and \u201eensure that its strategy, \nservices, activities and investments are fully informed by its commitment to \nraising levels of inclusion, diversity, opportunity and access and in developing \ncitizenship through film, moving image and digital media\u201f (EM Media 2005: 3, \n6).  \n Perhaps the most significant change in regional film funding has been \nthe reorganisation of resource allocation into a scheme-based system that aims \nto identify and nurture \u201enew talent\u201f. EM Media\u201fs film funding activities can be \ndivided into four main areas: business and project development, training, short \nfilm schemes and feature film finance. These areas are organised so to \nencourage a linear career progression towards commercial production; what is \noften termed the \u201estepping stone\u201f system. As their Business Plan noted in 2006: \nIn EM Media\u201fs experience of four operating years, by far the most effective and \nefficient way of addressing the needs of emerging talent is through specific \n 17 \nproject and scheme interventions where economy of scale can be readily \nachieved alongside the delivery of a quality experience. (Business plan 2006-\n2009) \n \nThese projects and schemes funded or part-funded 52 short films between \n2002 and 2005 representing a significant increase in filmmaking activity in the \nregion. At the same time this structure militates towards the production of films \nas a \u201ecalling card\u201f to secure funding for more ambitious projects, as opposed to \na discreet area of cultural practice. This raises the question of the efficacy of \ndirecting substantial amounts of public money towards supplying the \n\u201emainstream\u201f film and television industries with \u201enew talent\u201f and, occasionally, \nwith profitable media products. That said, while the structure of regional film \nproduction funding might be organised within a rigidly commercial model this \ndoes not necessarily determine the aspirations of the filmmakers or the \ncharacter of the films. Here an analysis of the films produced under the East \nMidlands Digital Shorts production scheme is instructive.  \nDigital Shorts is a national short film production scheme administered \nlocally on an annual basis by each RSA. While there are variations from region \nto region typically it works through an application and project development \nprocess that leads to the production of around ten films per region, per year, \nmade on a budget of \u00a310000 each. Applications are not usually open to people \nthat have been funded through the scheme before: if funding is organised on a \n\u201estepping stone\u201f basis then Digital Shorts is the first \u201estone\u201f.  \nWhat sort of films were produced through the Digital Shorts scheme in \nthe East Midlands?1 Reflecting the current industry standard all the films are \naround ten minutes long. Most are live action, fiction narratives shot on digital \nvideo (DV) with the occasional animation. The majority of the films work on the \n 18 \ninterplay of realism with thematic and stylistic devices drawn from outside \nnarrative cinema; particularly the television sketch show tradition of British \ncomedy. Recurrent themes of drug-taking, drinking, male relationships and \nmale angst are often realised through a stylised comedy. For example Why I \nHate Parties (But Pretend to Like Them) (Mark Davenport, 2003) takes a \nsimple premise of a man\u201fs insecurities at a party, drinking, smoking marijuana \nand chasing women, ending with him drunkenly punching another man. \nSimilarly A Stoner\u2019s Guide to Egg Fried Rice (Ray Wong, 2002) shows two \nstoned men take a lesson in making the dish of the title, with attendant comedy \nforgetfulness and banter. Look at Me (Nicholas Roach, 2002) is about a young \nman\u201fs frustrations in being ignored by his family. In a cry for attention he \ncommits suicide live on the internet using helium to asphyxiate himself, his \nsqueaky last words becoming a popular comedy download and giving him the \nattention in death that he craved in life.  \n Many of the films use camera work, editing and sound to flex stylistic \nand generic muscles. Cry (Steven Shiel, 2002) is the last ten minutes of a \nslasher film, a series of iconic images of threat to its female subject without a \nplot or dialogue. Or the accomplished grotesque black comedy What About \nthe Bodies (Simon Ellis, 2002) which shows the misadventures of a man \ntrying to bury a woman he thought he had murdered, that moves from farcical \nhumour to extreme violence.  \n Generally speaking, the films display a reliance on traditional narrative \nand generic modes within the short fiction form: comedy, horror, crime. These \nare often very successful, achieved with the production values of low-budget \nBritish feature films or mainstream television. Certainly they are outside the \n 19 \ntradition of aesthetic or political radicalism in regional film and it is interesting to \nnote the lack of engagement with ideas of national, regional, gendered or ethnic \nidentity; ideas that are prominent in regional policy discourse. On the other \nhand, Ben Pollard\u201fs Jerusalem (2003) is a simple narrative film about a \nJapanese man\u201fs attempt to record the \u201esound of London\u201f to take home with him \nto Tokyo. His efforts are frustrated until, in finding a place to sleep while he \nwaits for his flight, he is woken by the sound of a black airport cleaner playing \nthe song of the title on a piano in an act of defiance against her oppressive \nboss. The film manages to subtly convey a sense of the poetic through the \neveryday while also suggesting the fractured nature of national identity; a \ncleaner appropriating an emblem of patriotic Englishness (itself appropriated \nfrom William Blake\u201fs original revolutionary message) into an act of rebellion \nagainst the monotony of her job, which in turn becomes an emblem for the \nmulti-ethnic metropolis.  \n When taken together the films made under the Digital Shorts scheme in \nthe East Midlands show a tendency toward standardisation in terms of form and \ncontent. It is impossible to say precisely how far this has been institutionally \ndetermined. However, the description of the process by Andrew Brand, who \nmade To His Knees He Fell through the Digital Shorts scheme in 2004, is \nrevealing and worth quoting at length: \nThrough script development I had my idea and it changed off and on as it \nshould do. A lot of the changes I did were changes for the better. But it also \nchanged from what it was originally going to be. It was originally going to be \nthis big landscape film, more about the landscape itself, with these odd bits of \nplot that fit together in and amongst this landscape. For them to buy in to that I \nhad to turn it round so that it became a plot and there is this landscape \ninstead of the landscape being the main plotline. In a way they signed me up \non that premise but it slowly worked its way round with script development \nand them not feeling I could deliver something like that, which I feel I could. \n(Interview with the author) \n 20 \n \nHe continues: \nI think they like someone who has got a vision, a style that they are trying to \ncreate and a genre that they are trying to push as well. EM Media want to see \nyour creative development. They want you to have a five year plan. They want \nto see that you\u201fre an investment to them and that if they fund you you\u201fre going \nto push your area or your genre that you are going to focus on, and you\u201fre \ngoing to make a series of films for a future goal. (Interview with the author) \n \nThis draws attention to the pressures imposed by funding agencies in the \ndevelopment process that work to proscribe form and content towards \ntraditional narrative modes. It also illustrates the way that this process can \noperate externally; the way that the agendas of funding agencies work to \ndetermine what sort of projects they receive and what sort of projects are \ndeveloped in the first place. Taken alongside the constraints in the scheme \nmore generally, the length and medium (no more than ten minutes, shot on \nDV), and the \u201estepping stone\u201f system, we can say that there has been a \nconsiderable restriction of the space for creative autonomy in regional film \nproduction sectors in comparison with the workshop model.  \nAt the same time, the availability of relatively cheap DV film production \nequipment and facilities, the network of organisations willing to lend support \nand equipment to filmmakers and a collaborative production mentality mean \nthat since the late 1990s there has been a thriving low-budget film culture in the \nregion that is semi-autonomous of the funding agendas of regional institutions.  \nNottingham in particular has had a strong community of collaborative \nfilmmakers heavily influenced by the \u201eDIY\u201f culture that emerged in the 1990s. A \ndisparate movement, \u201eDIY\u201f culture incorporates social protest, dance culture, \ngrass-roots initiatives in arts and non-hierarchical community-based social \naction, united by a desire to be independent from the \u201emainstream\u201f. George \n 21 \nMcKay puts \u201eDIY\u201f culture in a tradition of non-mainstream independent cultural \nproduction going back to pirate radio in the 1960s, through punk rock in the late \n1970s and to rave culture in the late 1980s and 1990s (McKay 1998: 24-26). \nFor the filmmakers in the East Midlands the \u201eDIY\u201f ethic can be traced back to \nthe regional workshop movement and the spirit of collective action and self-help \nfostered in the 1980s and 1990s around organisations like Intermedia.  \nBang! short film festival, housed at the Broadway Media Centre in \nNottingham, has grown from this milieu. Started in 2000 by a group of local \nfilmmakers, the festival is entirely digital and runs three times per year showing \nlocally and nationally produced short films. Bang! has grown steadily over the \nyears; in 2007 having around four screenings every four months (a young \nfilmmakers\u201f, community films, animation and a main screening). It has no \nrestrictions on form or subject matter and has shown retrospectives of work \nproduced in the area as well as genre specific events. The festival is non-\ncompetitive and aims to support local filmmakers; to act as a platform to exhibit \nwork produced in the region; as a centre for the filmmaking community and a \ncatalyst for future collaborations and projects. This ethos can run counter to the \ntarget and profile-driven agendas of regional funding agencies and the festival \nhas had to resist pressure to become more traditional in its selection policies. \nThey receive around 100 films every four months, the majority produced \nwithout official institutional support with about 80 per cent made locally. This \ndemonstrates the breadth of \u201eDIY\u201f filmmaking in the region. \n\u201eDIY\u201f film culture may be seen as the heir to the cultural and political \nenvironment from which the workshop sector emerged, with the values and \npractices of cultural politics shifted from collectivist principles and a larger \n 22 \ncritique of capitalism towards a form of liberal, pluralist direct action which \nMcKay has called a \u201ekind of 1990s counterculture\u201f (McKay 1998: 2). As Bang! \nFilm Festival demonstrates, a surprisingly large and heterogeneous low-budget \nfilm production sector can exist independently of the apparatus of regional film \nfunding. While the Nottingham-based \u201eDIY\u201f film culture cannot be said to be part \nof a \u201emovement\u201f in the same way that the regional workshop movement can, it \ncan reasonably be described as an independent sphere of cultural practice. \nIt would be a mistake, however, to characterise the relationship between \nNottingham\u201fs \u201eDIY\u201f film culture and regional institutions as simply antagonistic. \nThis can be explored by looking at the \u201estepping stone\u201f system in action. Chris \nCooke is a Nottingham-based filmmaker that worked within the \u201eDIY\u201f film sector \nextensively before receiving funding for a series of short films leading to \ndevelopment and production funding of a locally-produced feature film. He \ndescribes the \u201eDIY\u201f approach to filmmaking: \nThere is a film community here in Nottingham . . . people are emerging their \nstyles because of the means that they\u201fve actually got. The actors are really \nfresh and really interesting round here, people are much less precious and \npretentious. It\u201fs a DIY culture as it started out. Traditionally it\u201fs been a really \nbadly funded region so you\u201fve had that thing where people have said \u201eI know \nsomeone who\u201fs got a camcorder, let\u201fs borrow it\u201f and have made stuff . . . \nwe\u201fve all got together with camcorders and we\u201fve done films that have been \nmuch more improvisatory, we\u201fve done films where the crew are improvising \nand where the cast are improvising or following a script, or whatever. But it is \nthe way the working methods derived out of having no money and it\u201fs become \na successful method of making films. (Interview with the author) \n \nCollaborative DV filmmaking has been crucial in the development of these \npractices, allowing a more fluid form of handheld photography to capture \nimprovisation; a process that continues into the edit. For example, on Shifting \nUnits (1999), Cooke\u201fs short film funded through the East Midlands Media \nInitiative and produced by Intermedia, ten hours of footage was cut into an eight \n 23 \nand a half minute film with the narrative constructed partially in the edit. These \npractices were carried into Cooke\u201fs debut feature film, One for the Road. It was \nfunded by EM Media and Film Four, shot on DV and largely improvised. \nThematically Cooke\u201fs films deal with male angst and pathos, and his \ncharacters\u201f inability to form relationships with those around them. His films \ncentre on a domestic sensibility and ironic humour with the distance between \nself-presentation and reality realised at a stylistic, as well as narrative, level \nthrough unconventional structures, the use of montage sequences, camera \nmonologues and voice-overs. Combined with rapid camera movement and \nediting, he has developed an unconventional stylistic and thematic coherence \nthat is directly drawn from his working practices.  \n Cooke\u201fs career is an example of the successful deployment of the \n\u201estepping stone\u201f system under the terms of UKFC policy: unconventional, low-\nbudget filmmaking practices drawn into \u201emainstream\u201f production and distribution \narrangements. However, Cooke notes: \u201eIf they were stepping stones there \nweren\u201ft very many of them, and you\u201fd have to have incredibly long legs, they \nwere so few and far between.\u201f (Interview with the author)  \n \nConclusion \nGraham Roberts has argued that in UKFC film policy it is possible to see \n\u201eregional [equals] out of the mainstream through its links to the \u201clow-budget and \nedgy\u201d New Cinema Fund.\u201f (Roberts 2002: 7) As this paper has argued, the \nterms of the \u201eterritorialisation\u201f of contemporary film policy has a history that \ngoes back to the model for regional filmmaking that developed in the regional \nworkshop movement. This is significant for two reasons: firstly, it demonstrates \n 24 \nthe root of the inconsistencies in a film policy that equates culture with \ncommerce at the same time as displacing cultural concerns from the \u201ecentre\u201f to \nthe regions. Secondly, film policy tends to have a short memory so it is worth \nreiterating that other kinds of filmmaking are possible. \nRoberts\u201f point, however, also suggests how the \u201ecultural burden\u201f of \nregional filmmaking that this paper has outlined has become manifest in \ncontemporary regional film policy and practice under the UKFC. RSAs like EM \nMedia use public money to identify and cultivate regionally-based creative \nworkers, and to provide low-investment, and occasionally innovative and \ntechnically experimental products for the increasingly diffuse national film and \ntelevision industries. Ideas of regional filmmaking as a cultural practice that \nwere developed through a rejection of commercially-motivated production and \ndistribution arrangements, a broadly progressive cultural politics, and realised \nthrough a relatively high degree of creative autonomy, have become absorbed \ninto a commercially determined emphasis on stylistic and technical features, \ntraining and career progression. As the case of the East Midlands \ndemonstrates, in a film policy discourse that views culture as a function of \ncommercial interests this works to restrict the space available for the production \nof films which do not fit into a narrowly perceived commercial formula. Ideas of \ncinema as a cultural practice, while still present at a rhetorical level, have been \nmade effectively redundant in regional film production funding. \nThat said, in the example of the East Midlands at least, access to digital \ntechnology, the residual structure of film production infrastructure that \ndeveloped from the 1970s and a strong \u201eDIY\u201f culture has allowed the \ndevelopment of filmmaking practices that maintain a degree of creative \n 25 \nautonomy from the agendas of official institutions. However, it is interesting to \nnote the extent to which the film culture of the region is male-dominated and \nthat the films nearly exclusively privilege male point of view structures. This is in \ncontrast to the many women filmmakers and women\u201fs groups that were active \nin regional film production sectors during the workshop period in the 1970s and \n1980s. Groups like the Sheffield Film Co-op or, in the East Midlands, women \nlike Dinah Caine adopted distinctly feminist filmmaking practices and regional \nfilm production sectors sustained this activity where the commercial film \nindustry would not. The absence of this sort of filmmaking in the contemporary \nscene cannot be explained solely by the ascendancy of the market in film \npolicy, but must include the recognition of the virtual disappearance of feminism \nfrom public culture. Arguably the same can be said of the expression of \nethnicity, class and regional identity in regionally-produced film. Despite the \nundoubted importance of the politics of film funding in limiting which \nrepresentations can make it to the screen, shifts in the expression of cinema as \na cultural practice also reflect wider changes in political culture and the values \nand practices of cultural politics. The opportunities afforded by \u201eDIY\u201f digital \nfilmmaking are to be welcomed. However, it remains to be seen whether \u201enew \nvoices\u201f and \u201ecreative risk taking\u201f can emerge from the gruelling rounds of \napplication procedures, project development and training.  \n \n                                            \nThanks are due to Andrew Brand, Chris Cooke, Rebecca Mark-Lawson, \nAnthony Thomas and Steven Shiel for agreeing to be interviewed for the \nresearch upon which this paper is based, and particularly to Andrew Brand for \nproviding access to the Bang!

Thanks are also due to \nRoberta Pearson and Melanie Selfe for their comments on an earlier draft of \nthis paper. \n \nNotes \n 26 \n                                                                                                                             \n \n1\nThe following analysis is based on my viewing of seventeen of the films made under the \nDigital Shorts scheme in the East Midlands. Indeed, obtaining viewing copies of the films \nmade under the scheme is difficult. While Digital Shorts has a distribution deal attached to it \nfilms that are not picked up by a broadcaster or successful at festivals are often not seen after \ntheir initial public screening. To the best of my knowledge, at the time of writing, neither EM \nMedia nor the UKFC have made all the films available. \n \nWorks cited \n \nAnstey, E.
