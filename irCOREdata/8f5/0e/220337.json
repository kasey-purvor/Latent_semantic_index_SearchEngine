Mixed\ninfections might generate synergistic or antagonistic interactions and thereby clinically affect individuals and\/or\nimpact parasite epidemiology.\nMethods: The current study uniquely assesses both Schistosoma mansoni- and Schistosoma haematobium-related\nmorbidity of the liver and the bladder as assessed by ultrasound as well as spleen and liver morbidity through\nclinical exams. The impact of praziquantel (PZQ) treatment on such potential inter-specific schistosome interactions\nand resulting morbidity using uniquely detailed longitudinal data (pre- and one year post-PZQ treatment) arising\nfrom the National Schistosomiasis Control Program in three areas of Mali: S\u00e9gou, Koulikoro and Bamako, is also\nevaluated. At baseline, data were collected from up to 2196 children (aged 7-14 years), 844 of which were infected\nwith S. haematobium only, 124 with S. mansoni only and 477 with both. Follow-up data were collected from up to\n1265 children.\nResults: Results suggested lower liver morbidity in mixed compared to single S. mansoni infections and higher\nbladder morbidity in mixed compared to single S. haematobium infections. Single S. haematobium or S. mansoni\ninfections were also associated with liver and spleen morbidity whilst only single S. haematobium infections were\nassociated with bladder morbidity in these children (light S. haematobium infection OR: 4.3, p < 0.001 and heavy\nS. haematobium infection OR: 19, p < 0.001). PZQ treatment contributed to the regression of some of the forms of\nsuch morbidities.\nConclusions: Whilst the precise biological mechanisms for these observations remain to be ascertained, the results\nillustrate the importance of considering mixed species infections in any analyses of parasite-induced morbidity,\nincluding that for the proposed Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) revised estimates of schistosomiasis\nmorbidity.\n* Correspondence: artemis.koukounari@imperial.ac.uk\n1Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, Department of Infectious Disease\nEpidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nKoukounari et al.

New integrated control programmes\nacknowledge this, with for instance combined mass\ndrug administration (MDA) for schistosomiasis, lym-\nphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma and soil-\ntransmitted helminths being initiated throughout parts\nof sub-Saharan Africa [1]. However, within-Genera\npolyparasitism must also be fully acknowledged. More-\nover, synergistic or antagonistic interactions resulting\nfrom such co-infections may be predicted to clinically\naffect individuals and\/or impact parasite epidemiology\n[2].\nSchistosomiasis is a chronic and debilitating disease\nwhich affects millions of people, particularly the rural\npoor in the developing world. Of some 600 million peo-\nple at risk, an estimated 200 million are infected, more\nthan half of which are symptomatic and at least 20 mil-\nlion exhibit severe disease manifestations [3]. Schisto-\nsomes, the causative agents, are parasitic bloodflukes\n(Phylum: Platyhelminth; Class: Trematoda) with indir-\nectly transmitted life-cycles involving obligatory alterna-\ntion of generations between sexual reproduction in a\nmammalian host and asexual reproduction within a\nmolluscan (freshwater snail) host. The clinical manifes-\ntations of schistosomiasis are classically associated with\nthe species-specific ovipositioning (egg-laying) sites; the\nmesenteric venous systems for Schistosoma mansoni\n(prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and South America)\nleading to chronic hepatic and intestinal fibrosis and the\nvesical venous plexus of the urogenital system for Schis-\ntosoma haematobium (prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa)\nassociated with ureteral and bladder fibrosis, calcifica-\ntion of the urinary tract and bladder cancer [4].\nCo-infections between S. mansoni and S. haemato-\nbium have been reported in an increasing number of\nfoci across Africa [5-9]. Furthermore, studies in Camer-\noon and Senegal have revealed that in areas of overlap,\nS. mansoni-shaped eggs may be excreted in urine as\nopposed to the usual faecal route [10]. Studies on schis-\ntosomiasis-associated morbidity tend to, nevertheless,\nalways consider single species infections individually [3].\nIn addition to affecting the prevalence and intensity of\nhuman infections, inter-specific parasite interactions\nduring mixed species infections may, however, also be\npredicted to impact host morbidity directly. In one of\nthe few studies to consider this, Cunin et al. (2003) in\nCameroon, for example, reported an apparent lowering\nof S. mansoni-induced morbidity (hepatomegaly and\nsplenomegaly morbidity, as determined through clinical\npalpation) in mixed infections with S. haematobium\nrelative to that observed for S. mansoni single infections\n[6]. The authors suggested that this lowering effect on\nliver morbidity could be due to S. haematobium males\nmating with S. mansoni females (which cannot success-\nfully hybridize) and the subsequent eggs produced from\nsuch couplings passing to the urinary oviposition site,\nthereby reducing the amount of classical S. mansoni-\ninduced morbidity. Laboratory rodent model studies\nhave confirmed these observations [11].\nPreventive mass drug administration (MDA) interven-\ntions, as are recently being employed across parts of\nsub-Saharan Africa [12,13], may be further predicted to\nhave an impact on such complex inter-specific interac-\ntions, especially if the selection pressure differs between\nthe parasite species, as may be plausible for S. mansoni\nand S. haematobium [14]. For example, S. mansoni and\nS. haematobium differ in their generation times\/length\nof time to maturation, and as juvenile schistosomes are\nnot susceptible to PZQ, this could potentially lead to\ndifferences between these two species in terms of their\nresponses to MDA within individual hosts. Such differ-\nences could also subsequently affect the order of estab-\nlishment of the parasites within their human hosts (a\nfactor known to be very important in determining the\noutcome of inter-specific competition and subsequent\nparasite-induced host morbidity [15,9]).\nHowever, despite the theoretical and applied interest\nof mixed schistosome species interactions on human\nhost morbidity under differing selective pressures, few\nstudies appear to have focused upon this. Indeed, to the\nauthors knowledge, no studies have yet examined the\npotential consequence of S. haematobium-associated\nbladder pathology in mixed species infections, nor the\npotential impact of MDA on hepatic and urinary-asso-\nciated morbidity of mixed schistosome species\ninfections.\nThe aim of the current study was to test if the\nhypothesis that liver morbidity in mixed schistosome\nspecies infections is lower relative to that observed for\nS. mansoni single infections [6], can be generalized in\ndifferent environmental settings within sub-Saharan\nAfrica such as Mali. Furthermore, while previous studies\nwere restricted to clinical examination and palpation of\nhepatomegaly and splenomegaly, the present study also\nincorporates detailed ultrasonography (US) to determine\nschistosome-specific morbidity in the liver and bladder.\nFinally, the current study also evaluates the impact of\nPZQ treatment on such potential inter-specific schisto-\nsome interactions and resulting morbidity using\nuniquely detailed longitudinal data (pre- and one year\npost-praziquantel (PZQ) treatment) arising from\nthe National Schistosomiasis Control Program in three\nareas of Mali: S\u00e9gou, Koulikoro and Bamako. The\nresults obtained should have theoretical and applied\nKoukounari et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:227\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/10\/227\nPage 2 of 14\nimplications regarding inter-specific schistosome inter-\nactions and human morbidity.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThe schools included in these surveys were randomly\nselected from all schools known a priori to be places\nwhere schistosomiasis is highly endemic: S\u00e9gou, Bamako\nand Koulikoro. Details concerning sample-size calcula-\ntions and cohort design have been described elsewhere\n[16]. We would like to acknowledge that this study\ndescribes data from an ongoing MDA control pro-\ngramme and not a double-blind placebo randomized\nclinical trial study.\nInitially 2196 children (aged 7 to 14 years) from 29\nschools were recruited with US and parasitological data\non both schistosome species infections. Of these, 844\nchildren were infected with S. haematobium only, 124\nwith S. mansoni only and 477 with both. Clinical exami-\nnations (i.e. liver and spleen palpations) were performed\non 2128 of these children, as part of the baseline survey\n(of these, 821 children were infected with S. haemato-\nbium only, 117 with S. mansoni only and 463 with\nboth).\nOnly 23 of the 29 schools surveyed at baseline were\nvisited at the second survey, due to financial and time\nconstraints. All subsequent analyses here of the follow-\nup (second survey) data exclude baseline data from the\n6 schools that were not followed up. Follow-up data\nwere collected from 1265 children from 23 schools (76%\nof the 1670 children recruited from these schools at\nbaseline) but only 853 children had complete clinical,\nUS and parasitological data on both schistosomiasis\ninfections. Follow-up rates following the first survey\nwere much higher for children under 13 years of age, as\nis common in such sub-Saharan regions where primary\nschool children leave for reasons such as work or early\nmarriage [17].\nBaseline surveys took place in the S\u00e9gou area in\nMarch and April of 2004 while the follow-up surveys\nwere performed just over one year later (i.e. in May\n2005). By the second survey children in the schools of\nthis area had received two MDA treatments with PZQ:\na) one just after baseline data collection (in March-April\n2004) and b) another during preventive chemotherapy\nintervention (in February 2005). In Bamako baseline sur-\nveys took place in July 2004 while the majority of the\nfollow-up surveys were performed almost two years\nlater (i.e. in April-May 2006) with the remaining three\nschools in this area to be visited in October 2006. A sin-\ngle round of MDA took place in 2005 (i.e. in May, June\nand November). Finally baseline surveys took place in\nKoulikoro during June-August 2004 while the follow-up\nsurveys took place almost two years later (i.e. in May\n2006). The children would have received one PZQ treat-\nment during the MDA in August 2005.\nClinical, ultrasound and parasitological examination\nClinical examination was performed on each child by\nexperienced clinical nurses who were blind to parasito-\nlogical results. The following measurements were\nrecorded: the excursion in centimeters of the spleen\nbelow the rib cage in the left mid-clavicular line (MCL)\nand left mid-axillary line (MAL); liver tenderness; the\nexcursion in centimeters of the left liver lobe beneath\nthe sternum in the mid-sternal line (MSL); the excur-\nsion of the right liver lobe beneath the rib cage in the\nright MCL. The consistency of the liver and spleen were\nalso graded as follows: not palpable, soft, firm and hard.\nThe presence of physical abnormalities such as ascites\nor other abdominal swelling, umbilical collaterals and\nscars were recorded as being present or absent, and\nfinally, the presence of liver tenderness or febrility were\nnoted [18].\nUltrasound (US) examination was performed with a\nportable ultrasonography device (SSD-500; Aloca,\nTokyo, Japan). For parasitologic examinations, a filtra-\ntion method was used to determine S. haematobium\ninfection intensity, whilst the Kato-Katz (KK) technique\nwas employed to define S. mansoni infection intensity.\nFurther details have been described elsewhere for both\nUS and KK [16].\nEthics statement\nEthical approval was obtained from the St Mary\u2019s Hospi-\ntal Local Ethics Research Committee, R&D office (part\nof the Imperial College, London Research Ethics Com-\nmittee (ICREC)) in combination with the ongoing Schis-\ntosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) activities, in areas\nwhere SCI is physically based. Within Mali, all aspects\nof Monitoring and Evaluation were carried out in the\nframework of the disease control activities implemented\nand approved by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and\nadopted by regional and local administrative and health\nauthorities. The communities of the selected villages\nwere informed about the objectives, the methodology of\nthe study and the advantages. A meeting was organized\nwith the population and verbal community consent was\nobtained for each selected village. Where the study was\nperformed within the schools, verbal consent was also\nobtained from school teacher\u2019s directors and teachers,\nprior to the recruitment of the children. Within Mali,\nfor cultural reasons, obtaining verbal consent from the\ncommunity leaders\/heads of villages (via community\nforum), and teachers\u2019 directors, is the most accepted\nprocedure, and hence the practice we followed here.\nThe results of the different diagnostic procedures per-\nformed on children were briefly explained to the\nKoukounari et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:227\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/10\/227\nPage 3 of 14\nchildren themselves. If any pathology was discovered,\nthis was reported to the parents or guardians, or, if this\nwas not possible, carefully explained to the teachers for\nthem to brief the children\u2019s parents or guardians. The\nhealth officer responsible for the nearest medical post,\nwho was usually present on spot at the time of the\nexaminations, was also informed about the pathology of\nthe children and asked to take care of them, according\nto the practices and procedures of the national health\nsystem of Mali.\nStatistical Analyses\nBaseline (pre-MDA) data were used to investigate\nwhether or not there was an association between schis-\ntosomiasis infection status and pathological manifesta-\ntions as determined by US examinations for liver and\nbladder morbidity as well as by clinical examinations for\nliver and spleen morbidities. Univariate analyses were\nperformed using chi-square tests for associations\nbetween schistosomiasis infection status and the various\npathological manifestations.\nIn order to study simultaneously the impact of several\ncovariates on the pathological manifestations at baseline,\nlogistic regression models with random effects at the\nschool level (i.e. multilevel logistic regressions) were\nfitted using the PROC NLMIXED command in SAS ver-\nsion 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Schistosomiasis\ninfections were classified on the basis of intensities\nusing WHO standards (see S1a in Additional file 1), and\nthese intensity classes were included as covariates. The\nassumption of linear effects of age was tested through\ncomparison with models including categorical effects for\neach year of age. The assumption of linear effects of\ninfection intensity classes was tested using the Akaike\ninformation criterion (AIC) to compare models assum-\ning linear effects (with and without an interaction of\nthose linear effects) with models fitting separate effects\nfor each combination of S. mansoni and S. haemato-\nbium intensity classes. The intensity classes for S. hae-\nmatobium infection were assigned 0 for \u2018not infected\u2019\n(0e\/10 ml), 1 for \u2018light\u2019 (< 50e\/10 ml) and 2 for \u2018heavy\u2019\n(> 50e\/10 ml) while the intensity classes for S. mansoni\ninfection were assigned 0 for \u2018not infected\u2019 (0 epg), 1 for\n\u2018light\u2019 (1-99 epg), 2 for \u2018medium\u2019 (100-399 epg) and 3\nfor \u2018heavy\u2019 (> 400 epg).\nDifferences in baseline characteristics were tested\nbetween children successfully and unsuccessfully fol-\nlowed up by univariate analysis using a Wilcoxon 2-\nsample test for means and a chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s\nexact test if there were small values for proportions.\nThe data were further analyzed excluding data from 13-\nand 14-year-old children because children in these age\ngroups would be more likely to have left school during\ninterval between baseline and follow-up assessments.\nStatistical analysis for the effect of MDA (i.e. post\nPZQ treatment, one year follow-up) was restricted to\nchildren with complete records on all outcomes of inter-\nest here (i.e. parasitological, US and clinical exam data)\nfrom both baseline and follow-up surveys. Differences in\nbaseline and separately follow-up health characteristics\nof children between pairs of the three surveyed areas of\nthe country were performed using two-proportion\nz-tests of unequal variances. Such comparisons were\nperformed as different treatment strategies had been fol-\nlowed between these regions.\nChanges of the health characteristics of children\nbetween the two time points of the study in relation to\ntheir baseline schistosomiasis infection status, adjusting\nat the same time for age and sex, were analyzed using\ngeneralized logit multinomial models for all three areas\nand for each morbidity measure using the PROC\nLOGISTIC command in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute\nInc., Cary, NC). In these models schistosome infection\nstatus was characterized as simply infected or not\ninfected, rather than by the intensity of infection, based\non model fits with prevalence and linear effects of inten-\nsity (see S3 in Additional File 1 for further details).\nFinally, in these models the response variable was a\nnew categorical variable with four levels indicating the\nfollowing: a) no pathological manifestation of each mor-\nbidity measure at both time points, b) pathological man-\nifestation of each morbidity measure at baseline but\ncured at final point of the study, c) no pathological\nmanifestation of each morbidity measure at baseline and\npathological manifestation of each morbidity measure at\nfinal point of the study, or d) pathological manifestation\nof each morbidity measure at both time points.\nResults\nThe ages of children were found to be approximately\nmatched between infection status groups. The mean\nages were: for the uninfected children 10.13 years old;\nfor the children with single S. haematobium infection\n10.52 years old; for the children with single S. mansoni\ninfection 10.96 years old; for those children who were\nco-infected with both schistosomes species the mean\nage was 10.64 years old.\nUnivariate analysis for the association between\nschistosomiasis infection status and pathological\nmanifestations at baseline\nFigure 1 presents baseline prevalence levels of liver or\nspleen morbidity as determined by US or clinical exami-\nnations and bladder morbidity as determined by US\nexamination for those with single and both schistosome\nspecies infections as well as those who were uninfected.\nChi-square tests revealed that the prevalence of liver\nand spleen morbidity (pathology characteristics 1 to 7 in\nKoukounari et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:227\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2334\/10\/227\nPage 4 of 14\nFigure 1) did not differ significantly in children with\nS. mansoni infection only compared with co-infected\nchildren. Similarly, the bladder morbidity (pathology\ncharacteristic 8, in Figure 1) did not differ significantly\nin children with S. haematobium infection only com-\npared with co-infected children.\nHowever, the prevalence levels of liver morbidity in\nthe forms of portal hypertension and hepatomegaly, as\nassessed both by US, were significantly higher among\nchildren infected with S. haematobium only than among\nuninfected children (p = 0.017 & p = 0.002 respectively\nfor pathology characteristics 2 and 3 in Figure 1). Simi-\nlarly, clinical examination revealed significantly higher\nprevalence levels of liver morbidity among children\ninfected with S. haematobium only than among unin-\nfected children (p = 0.001 and p = 0.010 respectively for\npathology characteristics with numbers 4 and 5 in\nFigure 1).\nClinical examination revealed significantly higher pre-\nvalence levels of spleen morbidity among children\ninfected with S. haematobium only than among unin-\nfected children (p < 0.001 for both pathology character-\nistics 6 and 7 in Figure 1). Finally, the prevalence level\nof bladder morbidity was significantly higher among\nchildren infected with S. haematobium only than among\nuninfected children (p < 0.001 for pathology characteris-\ntic 8 in Figure 1).\nMultivariate analyses for the association between the\nintensity of schistosomiasis infection status and\npathological manifestations at baseline\nModels with linear effects of intensities yielded better fit\nthrough AIC comparisons and these are the results that\nare presented here (see S1b in Additional File 1).

Furthermore,\nthere were no significantly increased risks of liver morbid-\nity, as assessed by positive PSL scores, among the co-\ninfected children with medium and high intensity S. man-\nsoni infections than among the uninfected children.\nThe risk of having hepatomegaly as assessed by\nMSL>2 cm (Table 2) appeared to depend only upon the\nintensity of the S. mansoni infection (risk was lowest\nwith no infection and increased with increased S. man-\nsoni intensity), with no effect of any S. haematobium\ninfection. Similarly, the risk of having hepatomegaly as\nassessed by MCL>2 cm (Table 2) appeared to depend\nonly upon the intensity of the S. mansoni infection (risk\nwas lowest with no infection and increased with\nincreased S. mansoni intensity), with no effect of any S.\nhaematobium infection.\nThe risk of having splenomegaly as assessed once by\nMCL>2 cm and then by MAL>2 cm did not depend on\nthe presence, or intensity of single or mixed S. mansoni\ninfection but it was slightly reduced in the presence of\nsingle S. haematobium infection (Table 2).\nThe risk of bladder pathology as assessed by US exam-\nination (Table 3) did not depend on the presence, or\nintensity of single S. mansoni infection but was much\nincreased in the presence of single S. haematobium\ninfection (light S. haematobium infection OR: 4.3, p <\n0.001 and heavy S. haematobium infection OR: 19, p <\n0.001 for children uninfected with S. mansoni in both\ncohorts) and even further in the presence of mixed\ninfections.\nDrop out rates at follow-up\nThere were significant differences in the ages of the 853\nchildren successfully followed up and the 817 children\nwho dropped out during the follow-up (p < 0.001); chil-\ndren who dropped out were older on average than chil-\ndren who were successfully followed up (i.e. 11.25 years\nversus 9.62 years). There were also significant differ-\nences between these two groups of children with refer-\nence to the prevalence of abnormal liver image patterns\n(p = 0.024) and the bladder pathology (p = 0.010), as\ndetermined by US examination, as well as the preva-\nlence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly as determined\nby clinical examination (p = 0.020 and p = 0.003 respec-\ntively). These indicators of morbidity were significantly\nlower at baseline among children that dropped out than\nin children who were successfully followed up. For all\nother pathological manifestations considered, there were\nno significant differences between these two groups of\nchildren: those who dropped out and those who were\nsuccessfully followed up.\nExcluding data from children aged 13 and 14 years at\nbaseline, the only significant follow-up differences were\nthat the prevalences of mixed schistosome species infec-\ntions and bladder pathology were significantly lower in\nthose children who dropped out compared to those who\nwere successfully followed up. The observation that\nmost features examined were similar in children that\nwere successfully followed up and children who dropped\nout during the follow-up suggested that results obtained,\nafter appropriate adjustment for age, were largely repre-\nsentative of the population from which the sample had\nbeen selected (see S2 in Additional File 1 for further\ndetails).\nImpact of MDA\nBoth at baseline and at follow-up the heaviest intensities\nof S. haematobium infection were observed in S\u00e9gou\nwhile the heaviest intensities of S. mansoni infection\nwere observed in Koulikoro (Table 4). However, in all\nthree areas and for both schistosome species, there were\nobserved significant decreases from baseline to follow-\nup in the classes of heavy intensities with the exception\nof Bamako area and the heavy intensity of S. mansoni\ninfection. It should be noted though that the latter was\nvery low at baseline and thus even if there was a signifi-\ncant drop post treatment, it was unlikely to have been\ndetected with this small sample size. Co-infections also\ndecreased significantly in all three areas at follow-up\nrelative to baseline.\nThere were no substantial changes in the prevalence\nof abnormal liver image patterns from baseline to fol-\nlow-up in all three areas (Table 4).

In the other two areas,\nfollow-up results indicated significant increases relative\nto baseline. Within both time points, differences in\nthese proportions were statistically significant when\ncomparing S\u00e9gou with the other two areas (Table 4).\nResults of clinical examinations suggested significant\ndecreases in the prevalence of splenomegaly in Kouli-\nkoro and S\u00e9gou from baseline to follow-up. The preva-\nlence of splenomegaly in Bamako between the two time\npoints of the study was similar. For the prevalence of\nhepatomegaly, there was a significant decrease between\nthe two time points of the study only in S\u00e9gou whilst in\nthe other two surveyed areas this was similar.\nAs the descriptive analysis of the results of clinical and\nUS examinations indicated very low prevalences of\npathology in Bamako and Koulikoro, the fitting of multi-\nnomial models for the changes of pathological manifes-\ntations was restricted to the data of children from\nS\u00e9gou. Even within the S\u00e9gou area, the fitting algorithm\nconverged only for four outcome variables: liver image\npatterns, portal hypertension as determined by positive\nPVD scores from US examination, splenomegaly as\nassessed by MCL exceeding 2 cm from clinical examina-\ntion and splenomegaly as assessed by MAL exceeding\n2 cm from clinical examination (see Table 5 for results).\nIn addition valid results were obtained only when the\nschistosome infection status was characterized as simply\ninfected or not infected (see S3 in Additional File 1 for\nfurther details).\nConsidering liver image patterns, children with S.\nmansoni infection at baseline compared to those without\nwere more likely to have liver image pathology at one or\nboth time points. In addition, among those children\nwith liver pathology at baseline, those with S. mansoni\ninfection at baseline were much more likely than\nchildren without to have liver pathology at follow-up\n(OR for pathology at both time points: 34.6 was much\ngreater than OR for pathology at baseline but no pathol-\nogy at follow-up: 3.1).\nThe regression model for portal hypertension from US\nshowed that children with S. mansoni infection at base-\nline would have such pathology at baseline but it did\nnot enable us to predict what is going to happen after\ntreatment (OR for pathology at both time points: 2.8\nwas similar to the OR for pathology at baseline but not\nat follow-up: 3.1).\nChildren with S. mansoni infection at baseline com-\npared to those with no S. mansoni infection were most\nlikely to have splenomegaly as assessed by clinical exam-\nination at both examined time points of interest (OR =\n2.9, p = 0.002).\nFinally, those children infected with S. haematobium\nat baseline proved significantly less likely than those\nwithout S. haematobium to have liver pathology at both\ntime points of study (OR = 0.2, p = 0.015; OR = 0.4, p\n= 0.046 for the risk of portal hypertension and spleno-\nmegaly, respectively); those children infected with S.\nhaematobium at baseline proved also significantly less\nlikely than those without S. haematobium to have liver\npathology at baseline and being cured from such mor-\nbidity at follow up.\nDiscussion\nBoth S. mansoni and S. haematobium schistosome spe-\ncies infections are prevalent in much of sub-Saharan\nAfrica and are known to be co-endemic in several coun-\ntries, such as Mali under study here, with currently\navailable studies contributing useful information with\nregards to the epidemiology and immunology of each of\nthese separate specific parasitic infections [19-27].

Furthermore, our study has\nalso indicated through univariate analysis that at base-\nline significantly more children with S. haematobium\nonly, compared to uninfected children, had liver mor-\nbidity (i.e. portal hypertension and hepatomegaly-as\nassessed by both US and clinical examination) or spleen\nmorbidity as assessed by clinical examination; baseline\nresults from multivariate analysis yielded significant\nincreased risks of hepatomegaly as assessed by positive\nPSL scores for children with single S. haematobium\ninfections compared to uninfected children (ORs for\nTable 4 Health characteristics of schoolchildren successfully retraced (i.e. pre and post treatment-n = 853)\nBaseline Post-treatment\nBamako Koulikoro S\u00e9gou Bamako Koulikoro S\u00e9gou\n(n = 273) (n = 153) (n = 427) (n = 273) (n = 153) (n = 427)\nParasitology\n% Uninfected 45.05 (< 0.001)a 14.38 (< 0.001)b 8.90 (< 0.001)c 64.10 (< 0.001)d ** 32.68 (0.010)e ** 40.05 (< 0.001)f **\n% Infected with\nS. haematobium\n43.96 (< 0.001)a 3.92 (< 0.001)b 57.38 (< 0.001)c 26.37 (< 0.001)d ** 5.23 (< 0.001)e 35.36 (0.011) f **\n% Infected with S. mansoni 1.10 (< 0.001)a 24.84 (< 0.001)b 4.22 (0.007)c 4.03 (< 0.001)d ** 40.52 (< 0.001)e ** 14.05 (< 0.001)f **\n% Co-infected 9.89 (< 0.001)a 56.86 (< 0.001)b 29.51 (< 0.001)c 5.49 (< 0.001)d ** 21.57 (0.002)e ** 10.54 (0.013)f **\n% Heavy S. haematobium\ninfections\n13.19 (0.040) a 7.19 (< 0.001) b 39.58 (< 0.001) 2.20 (0.161)c ** 0.65 (< 0.001) e ** 7.73 (< 0.001) f **\n% Heavy S. mansoni infections 0.73 (< 0.001) 22.88 (0.005) 12.41 (< 0.001) 0.00 (< 0.001) 10.46 (0.003) ** 2.81 (< 0.001) **\nLiver Pathology as assessed by ultrasound (US) examination\n% with abnormal liver image\npatterns\n0.37 (0.316)a 0.00 (< 0.001)b 12.18 (< 0.001)c 0.37 (0.316)d 0.00 (< 0.001)e 12.88 (< 0.001)f\n% with portal hypertension\n(as determined by positive PVD\nscores)\n0.73 (0.585)a 1.31 (< 0.001)b 9.60 (< 0.001)c 5.49 (0.013)d ** 13.07 (0.076)e ** 7.73 (0.237)f\n% with hepatomegaly (as\ndetermined by positive PSL\nscores from US)\n0.37 (0.701)a 0.65 (0.085)b 2.34 (0.085)c 0.00 (0.316)d 0.65 (0.545)e 0.23 (0.317)f **\nLiver + spleen pathology as assessed by clinical examination\n% with hepatomegaly as\nassessed by MSL>2 cm\n0.00 (0.316)a 0.65 (< 0.001)b 9.84 (< 0.001)c 0.00 (0.080)d 1.96 (0.291)e 0.70 (0.082)f **\n% with hepatomegaly as\nassessed by MCL>2 cm\n0.00 (0.316)a 0.65 (< 0.001)b 8.67 (< 0.001)c 0.00 (0.080)d 1.96 (0.291)e 0.70 (0.082)f **\n% with splenomegaly as\nassessed by MCL>2 cm\n0.73 (< 0.001)a 12.42 (< 0.001)b 27.17 (< 0.001)c 0.00 (0.023)d 3.27 (0.009)e ** 8.43 (< 0.001)f **\n% with splenomegaly as\nassessed by MAL>2 cm\n0.73 (< 0.001)a 8.50 (< 0.001)b 25.06 (< 0.001)c 0.00 (0.043)d 2.61 (0.010)e ** 7.26 (< 0.001)f **\nBladder Pathology as assessed by US examination\nBladder pathology (as\ndetermined by positive global\nscores from US)\n8.42 (0.194)a 5.23 (< 0.001)b 22.95 (< 0.001)c 22.34 (0.057)d ** 15.03 (< 0.001)e ** 3.98 (< 0.001)f **\nap-values comparing proportions reported between Bamako and Koulikoro at baseline in parentheses; b p-values comparing proportions reported between\nKoulikoro and S\u00e9gou at baseline in parentheses; c p-values comparing proportions reported between Bamako and S\u00e9gou at baseline in parentheses; d p-values\ncomparing proportions reported between Bamako and Koulikoro at follow-up in parentheses; e p-values comparing proportions reported between Koulikoro and\nS\u00e9gou at follow-up in parentheses; f p-values comparing proportions reported between Bamako and S\u00e9gou at follow-up in parentheses; ** significant differences\nat a = 0.05 between baseline and post treatment paired proportions as indicated by McNemar\u2019s test\nUS, ultrasound; PVD, portal vain diameters; PSL, parasternal line; MSL, mid-sternal line; MCL, mid-clavicular line; MAL, mid-axillary line\nKoukounari et al.

However, the\napproximately matched ages of children between infec-\ntion status groups sampled here may warrant against\nthis as a sufficient potential explanation, although we\nadmittedly cannot fully discount the possibility of some\nvery light current S. mansoni infections being missed\nduring the single Kato Katz examinations. An alternative\nplausible explanation, therefore, may be related to the\nfact that S. haematobium eggs are found in the liver and\ndo cause granulomas, albeit to a lesser extent than S.\nmansoni, as both of these schistosome species involve a\nhepatic portal system migration phase during their life-\ncycles [32,33], which could plausibly result in some\npathology. In any case, further research into this poten-\ntially very important observation, of liver pathology in S.\nhaematobium infections (urinary schistosomiasis), and\nnot only S. mansoni infections (intestinal schistosomia-\nsis) is warranted.\nAs regards the bladder morbidity examined here, our\nresults indicated that at baseline children with single\nand mixed schistosome species infections were signifi-\ncantly more likely to have this risk. Moreover, the risk\nof having such morbidity was greater in mixed infec-\ntions than in single S. haematobium infections of the\nsame intensity. Once again the mechanisms behind such\nincreased bladder morbidity in mixed as compared to\nsingle species infections is uncertain. As we predicted\nfrom the results of the Cameroon study in humans\n[5,6], combined with that know from laboratory mixed\nspecies studies in mice [11], synergistic or antagonistic\ninteractions resulting from mixed species infections, and\nin particular potential interspecific S. mansoni: S. hae-\nmatobium pairings, might be likely to lead to bladder\nabnormalities as observed by US. In part, mixed species\ninfections within a single host may compete, and\nincrease their individual egg output and subsequent\nvirulence to their host, relative to that produced under\nsingle species infections [34]. Indeed, it has been\nobserved in very high infection intensities cases, eggs\nfrom either species can be found in a range of \u2018addi-\ntional\u2019 internal organs [32], although the current ana-\nlyses controlled for infection intensity and so this alone\nis unlikely to fully explain the results here. More plausi-\nbly the observed results may indicate S. haematobium\nmales mating with S. mansoni females and the subse-\nquent (infertile) eggs produced from such couplings pas-\nsing to the urinary oviposition site, thereby reducing the\namount of classical S. mansoni-induced morbidity whilst\nincreasing the classic S. haematobium-associated bladder\nmorbidity. Furthermore, it may be plausible that the\ninfertile, and immunogenically novel, hybrid eggs pro-\nduced from such female S. mansoni and male S. haema-\ntobium heterologous pairs in the urinary tract may not\nbe as adept at transversing the urinary tract wall, relative\nto their pure-bred single species counterparts, and hence\nmay more frequently become trapped, and cause granu-\nloma-related morbidity, in the urinary tract and bladder\ntissues. Whatever the precise aetiology, the results indi-\ncate again that any consideration of schistosome-asso-\nciated morbidity in the human hosts should examine\nfurther than the traditional single species \u2018liver\/spleen\u2019\nfor S. mansoni and bladder\/urinary tract for S.\nhaematobium.\nWhen pre- and post-MDA data were analyzed we\nfound that at baseline the highest prevalence of S. hae-\nmatobium infection was observed in S\u00e9gou while the\nhighest prevalences of S. mansoni infection and co-\ninfections were both found in Koulikoro. At follow-up,\nprevalences of single and mixed S. haematobium infec-\ntions significantly decreased with the exception of Kouli-\nkoro where prevalence of single S. haematobium\ninfections significantly increased. Furthermore, the pre-\nvalence of S. mansoni infection after PZQ treatment sig-\nnificantly increased in all three areas in Mali, as has\nbeen reported in Senegal and Egypt [8,9]. Heavy intensi-\nties for both S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections\nhave both significantly decreased in Koulikoro and\nSegou after PZQ treatment. At follow-up there were sig-\nnificant decreases in liver\/spleen and bladder patholo-\ngies in the S\u00e9gou area while in Bamako and Koulikoro\nareas there were observed significant increases in blad-\nder pathology. This finding does, as we predicted, high-\nlight the importance of looking at both liver and bladder\nwhen assessing morbidity, particularly in areas of mixed\nfoci.\nMoreover, multivariate analysis on the two years\u2019 data\nfrom S\u00e9gou area highlighted the causative role of S.\nmansoni infections compared to absence of infection\nwith S. mansoni with respect to chronic liver morbidity,\nboth before and after PZQ treatment. More precisely,\nwe found that those children who were infected with S.\nmansoni only compared to those uninfected at baseline\nwere significantly more likely to have liver morbidity at\nfollow-up. For those children who were infected with S.\nhaematobium only compared to those uninfected at\nbaseline, they were found significantly less likely to have\nchanges in their liver morbidity during the two years of\nstudy. However, intensities of infection were not\nincluded in this part of the analysis and further research\nhere is therefore warranted.\nWe do recognize the inherent limitations of this study,\nwhere treatments provided could not be randomized\nbecause of ethical reasons associated with a national\nschistosomiasis control program, in addition to the a\nKoukounari et al.

Other\npotentially confounding factors such as additional con-\ncurrent parasitic diseases, for example malaria, could\ncomplicate the interpretation of results, and further\nresearch to elucidate these complicating factors is war-\nranted. Nevertheless, we still believe that the results of\nthis study add important insights into polyparasite inter-\nactions and their implications to the human host.\nConclusions\nTo conclude, this study found decreased liver morbidity\nin mixed schistosome species infections compared to\nsingle S. mansoni infections and increased bladder mor-\nbidity in mixed schistosome species infections compared\nto single S. haematobium infections. Single S. haemato-\nbium or S. mansoni infections were also associated with\nliver and spleen morbidity, while only single S. haemato-\nbium infections were associated with bladder morbidity\nin these children. PZQ treatment contributed to the\nregression of some of the forms of such morbidities.\nThe precise biological mechanisms for these observa-\ntions remain to be fully ascertained but, at least, the\nestimates of schistosomiasis morbidity DALYs should\ntake the current findings into account.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Supplement for the manuscript \u2018The impact of\nsingle versus mixed schistosome species infections on liver, spleen\nand bladder morbidity within Malian children pre and post\nPraziquantel treatment\u2019.
