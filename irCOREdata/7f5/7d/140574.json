Global scale environmental degradation and its links with non-renewable fossil fuels have lead to an\nincreasing interest in generating electricity from renewable energy resources. Much of this interest\ncentres on offshore renewable energy developments (OREDs). The large scale of proposed OREDs will\nadd to the existing human pressures on coastal ecosystems, therefore any ecological costs and benefits\nmust be determined.\n2. The current pressures on coastal ecology set the context within which the potential impacts (both\npositive and negative) of offshore renewable energy generation are discussed.\n3. The number of published peer-review articles relating to renewable energy has increased dramatically\nsince 1991. Significantly, only a small proportion of these articles relate to environmental impacts and\nnone consider coastal ecology.\n4. Actual or potential environmental impact can occur during construction, operation and\/or\ndecommissioning of OREDs.\n5. Construction and decommissioning are likely to cause significant physical disturbance to the local\nenvironment. There are both short and long term implications for the local biological communities. The\nsignificance of any effects is likely to depend on the natural disturbance regime and the stability and\nresilience of the communities.\n6. During day-to-day operation, underwater noise, emission of electromagnetic fields and collision or\navoidance with the energy structures represent further potential impacts on coastal species, particularly\nlarge predators. The wider ecological implications of any direct and indirect effects are discussed.\n7. Synthesis and applications. This review demonstrates that OREDs will have direct and potentially\nindirect consequences for coastal ecology with these effects occurring at different scales. Ecologists\nshould be involved throughout all the phases of an ORED to ensure that appropriate assessments of the\ninteraction of single and multiple developments with the coastal environment are undertaken.\n3Key-words\nCoastal environmental impact, coastal ecology, habitat disturbance, enhancement, stability, resilience\n4Introduction\nThe generation of electricity from renewable energy resources is fast becoming a key objective of many\ncountries. The driving force behind this is the link between non-renewable fossil fuels and\nenvironmental degradation (Dincer 1999; Chow, Kopp & Portney 2003). Climate change is a major\nconcern leading to predictions of global temperature rise of 3-5oC within 50 years and an increase in\nclimatic variability (Houghton et al. 2001). Although the consequences of climate change are currently\nthe subject of much debate, from an ecological standpoint the concern arises from evidence for\ngeographical shifts in the distribution of species (Pounds & Puschendorf 2004), predictions of a sharp\nincrease in extinction probability for many plant and animal species (Thomas et al. 2004) and wider\nimpacts on ecosystems (Leemans & Eickout 2004). Add to this the predicted decline in the amounts of\nnon-renewable resources over the next few decades (Pimentel et al. 2002) and it is clear that alternatives\nto fossil fuels are needed.\nCountries with coastlines have particularly valuable renewable energy resources in the form of tides,\ncurrents, waves and offshore wind. Coastal waters are extensive and the associated renewable energy\nresources are plentiful and predictable (Pelc & Fujita 2002). In addition, the perceived aesthetic problem\nof siting large numbers of energy generating devices (eg. wind turbines) in terrestrial landscapes is\nreduced by locating them offshore. Not surprisingly therefore, considerable attention is now being\ndirected towards coastal waters in an effort to harness offshore renewable energy sources.\nCoastal zones, however, are already under significant pressure from human activity owing to their high\nbiological productivity and accessibility (Blaber et al. 2000) and their provision of valuable ecosystem\nservices and functions (Costanza et al. 1997). It is imperative therefore that the implications of\ngenerating electricity from offshore renewable sources are appropriately assessed with regard to the\ncurrent ecological status of the coastal zone and the potential consequences.\n5Existing coastal ecological status\nMajor changes to coastal ecosystems are attributable to human activities. Pressure from fisheries has\ndramatically reduced biomass, changed diversity, altered local trophic and community structure, and\ndegraded habitat (Blaber et al. 2000; Pauly et al. 2002). Large scale oil and gas operations have been\nimplicated in the perturbation of the coastal environment (Holdway 2002) and other industrial processes\nhave lead to bioaccumulation of contaminants (Matthiessen & Law 2002); abnormal development of\ninvertebrates, (Fichet, Radenac & Miramand 1998); endocrine disruption (Tyler, Jobling & Sumpter\n1998); nutrient enrichment, toxic algal blooms and deoxygenation (Carpenter et al. 1998).\nA variety of terrestrial land uses and near shore activities (Mason 2002; Matthiessen & Law 2002) have\nlead to local habitat loss and disturbance, changes to nutrient status and cycling, loss of food supplies,\nerosion, reduced sediment supply, changes in the level of sea inundation and increased exposure to\nnatural disturbances (McLusky, Bryant & Elliott 1992; Schekkerman, Meininger & Meire 1994; Rogers\n& McCarty 2000).\nOffshore renewable energy developments (OREDs) will also impact on coastal ecosystems because\nsingle developments have ecological footprints extending over several square kilometres of near shore\nwaters. Larger OREDs (with individual footprints approximately 20-50 km2 or greater), located adjacent\nto each other, are planned for the future. Such developments will require proper consideration of any\npotential impact on the ecosystem at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. However our current\nunderstanding of the effects of human activity on the coastal environment is limited and piecemeal\n(Mann 2000).\nIt is the aim of this paper to provide an integrated review of the potential ecological implications of\noffshore renewable energy generation in the coastal environment at different scales.\n6Current scientific knowledge relating to renewable energy\nThe general growth of interest in renewable energy is well illustrated by the significant increase in the\nnumber of published scientific articles over the last ten years (Fig. 1). However, only 7.6% of these\narticles related to environmental impacts, whether positive or negative, and just 4.0% specifically\nconsidered the ecological implications of harnessing any renewable energy source. More importantly\nless than 1% of the articles considered the potential environmental risks of renewable energy\nexploitation and none specifically related to coastal ecology. Ecological factors are not being considered\nproperly and are under-represented in any discussion of the costs and benefits of adopting offshore\nrenewable energy sources.\nOffshore Renewable Energy Developments\nDirect effects on coastal environment\nOREDs currently encompass wind, wave, tidal and current power, with offshore wind power being the\nmost actively pursued (Byrne & Houlsby 2003). All OREDs convert a renewable energy source into\nelectricity via energy generation devices (eg. turbines or hydrofoils). To convert sufficient energy to be\neconomically viable requires a large expanse of seabed for the device foundations and related structures\nto fix the devices in place.\nDifferent degrees of physical disturbance will occur during the three phases of the life of an ORED: 1-\nconstruction; 2 - routine operation; 3 - decommissioning. It is generally assumed that the direct effects\nof decommissioning a site will be similar to those associated with construction. Two further specific\nconsiderations are the type and extent of seabed covered by the development, and the extent of cabling.\nThese aspects are summarised in Fig. 2.\nDuring construction and decommissioning the seabed will be disturbed by construction of the\nfoundations for the energy conversion devices and any associated substations, and by laying underwater\n7power cables between devices and the main connection to shore. Removal of sediments will lead to\ndirect loss of habitats and there will be an increase in local water turbidity arising from suspended solids.\nRe-suspended sediments will be transported by prevailing water movement during construction, which\nmay also mobilise any contaminants within the sediments.\nMobilised sediments may smother the neighbouring habitats of sedentary species. For OREDs using\ncurrent or tidal energy the effects of suspended sediment may extend downstream. Re-suspension of\nsediments high in organic matter such as in estuaries and tidal reaches of rivers will likely temporarily\nreduce available oxygen owing to an increased biochemical oxygen demand. No published studies have\nassessed the ecological implications of ORED construction so evidence from benthic habitats which\nhave been fished or subjected to marine dredging is used to discuss possible consequences (Fig. 2).\nSpecies assemblages within sediments exhibit natural variation spatially and through time as a result of\nbiotic interactions and environmental disturbance. Nevertheless, fishing and dredging related disturbance\nhave been shown to alter local species diversity and population density (Blyth et al. 2004). The\nmagnitude of the effects on the benthic community and the length of time that they are apparent depend\non the duration and intensity of the disturbance (van Dalfsen et al. 2000) and the resilience of the local\ninfauna (Drabsch, Tanner & Connell 2001). Areas that suffer least from natural disturbance are affected\nby fishing activity to a greater extent (Kaiser & Spencer 1996).\nAfter fishing or dredging has ceased, recolonisation takes from months to years (Harvey, Gauthier &\nMunro 1998; Bradshaw et al. 2000). Small opportunistic species, such as polychaetes and amphipods,\nare the quickest to colonise after physical disturbance, whilst epifaunal species assemblages are likely to\ntake longer (Harvey, Gauthier & Munro 1998; Newell et al. 2004). Change may be rapid with soft\nsubstrata and new habitat can be created if the conditions are suitable. On coarse and more stable\nsubstrata, change is likely to be slower (Kaiser & Spencer 1996).\n8A conceptual model proposed by Jennings, Kaiser & Reynolds (2001) suggests that as sedimentary\nhabitats become more stable, so the effects of fishing disturbance are more extreme and longer lasting.\nThis applies both to the structure and composition of the benthic assemblage and the topography and\nphysical structure of the sediment. Evidence from fishing shows that the scale of disturbance can also\naffect composition of the community on a local and regional scale (Hall 1994) and removal of ecological\nengineering species can have devastating consequences for local biodiversity and ecosystem processes\n(Coleman & Williams 2002).\nAssuming fishing and dredging related disturbance to be analogous to construction and\ndecommissioning of an ORED, a local loss of sedentary infauna and reef builders would be expected,\nwhilst non-sedentary marine benthos would be displaced. Ecologically it is important to understand the\nsusceptibility of species and their resilience to the effects of ORED construction\/decommissioning and\nthe processes determining community recovery after the disturbance. Implicit in this understanding is\nknowledge of the stability of the substrata on which the ORED is constructed.\nA major difference between OREDs and other human impacts in near-shore waters are the extensive\nsub-surface structures present following construction. These structures may affect local water\nmovements, which are fundamental to some aquatic species (Montgomery et al. 2000), and also\ndetermine the transportation and deposition of sediments.\nAlthough the effects of decommissioning an ORED are assumed to be the same as those associated with\nits construction, the one obvious difference is the removal of the existing undersea structures. Removal\nof long established OREDs will immediately reduce habitat heterogeneity and take out a large\ncomponent of the benthic community. Indirect effects such as changes to local food web interactions and\n9habitat availability may also occur similar to those associated with fishing (Kaiser & Jennings 2002).\nThis will depend on species and community susceptibility and resilience to the changes.\nOther direct effects\nSignificant marine noise and vibration will occur during construction piling and drilling, and noise will\nalso be emitted during the operational phase, together with electromagnetic fields (EM-Fields)\nassociated with electricity production. The significance of these two disturbances will strongly depend\non their frequency, intensity and duration in relation to the sensitivity of the organisms and their ability\nto habituate to the noise or EM-Field. A further disturbance relates to organisms colliding with or\navoiding the energy generation devices.\nNoise\nFoundation construction and cable laying have been shown to produce noise up to 260 dB re: 1\u00b5Pa and\n178 dB re: 1\u00b5Pa respectively (Nedwell, Langworthy & Howell 2004). These significant sources of noise\ncould cause damage to the acoustic systems of species within 100m of the source and are expected to\ncause mobile organisms to avoid the area (Nedwell, Langworthy & Howell 2004). Any effects of the\nnoise will depend on the sensitivity of the species present and their ability to habituate to the noise, and\nwill reduce when the level of noise has decreased following completion of the construction (or\ndecommissioning) phase.\nThe potential disturbances to birds and people from noise and vibrations generated by the operation of\nthe wind turbines are also considered important in ORED environmental impact assessments. Current\nopinion is that by being located offshore the noise will be less detectable by humans. However, any\neffects of ORED operational noise on birds have not yet been investigated although noise from human\nactivity on land has been shown to reduce the local abundance of birds (Forman & Deblinger 2000;\nFernandez-Juricic 2001). Breeding seabirds are known to be disturbed by human recreational activity\n10\n(Dunnet et al. 1990; Beale & Monaghan 2004) and underwater noise has been used to reduce predation\npressure on molluscs by waterfowl (Ross, Lien & Furness 2001).\nUnderwater, where a large number of species from very different taxa interact acoustically (e.g.\ncetaceans, pinnipeds, teleosts, crustaceans; Bradbury & Veherencamp 1998) the potential for disturbance\nfrom long term ORED operation is high. Sound is used for communication (Lugli, Yan & Fine 2003),\nfinding prey, echolocation (particularly by marine mammals, Tyack & Clark 2000), locating recruitment\nsites in fish (Simpson et al. 2004), finding potential mates and avoiding predators (Popper & Fay 1993).\nFish have shown startle and alarm response when encountering a loud noise (eg. >150dB re: 1\u00b5Pa;\nBlaxter, Gray & Denton 1981; Pearson, Skalski & Malme 1992). More recent studies have demonstrated\na link between underwater noise and changes to the auditory threshold of some species of freshwater fish\n(0.3-2.0 kHz, 142dB re: 1\u00b5Pa; Scholik & Yan 2002). However, this is not the case for all species as\nsome freshwater fish have evolved a strategy using different parts of the sound spectrum for\ncommunication (around 0.1 kHz, 85-110dB re: 1\u00b5Pa) effectively adapting to local ambient noise (Lugli,\nYan & Fine 2003).\nResearch on the effects of anthropogenic noise in the coastal environment is limited (Popper et al. 2003)\nbut studies suggest that marine species are exposed to noises from a variety of sources (Harwood &\nWilson 2001). Research on existing offshore wind farms along Baltic Sea coasts (Hoffman et al. 2000;\nFristedt, Moren & Soderberg 2001) has shown that the acoustic environment is added to by the operation\nof the wind turbines (0.001-0.4 kHz, 80-110 dB re: 1\u00b5Pa) and the level of acoustic disturbance is likely\nto be a function of the number of turbines and their operating procedure and timing at lower frequencies.\nClearly it is important to establish whether the type, frequency and intensity of sounds associated with\nOREDs will have any implications (such as reaction or habituation) for the species that inhabit or\n11\nmigrate through the coastal environment. Analysis of the spatial and temporal behavioural of sensitive\nspecies in concert with measurements of the acoustic environment is required.\nElectromagnetic fields (EM-Fields)\nThe high voltage Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) cables which transmit power\nbetween devices and to the mainland have the potential to interact with aquatic animals that are sensitive\nto electric (E-field) and magnetic (B-field) fields. This affects mainly fish, particularly the\nelasmobranchs, and marine mammals. that use the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to navigate. In addition, some\nspecies utilise E-fields behaviourally.\nIndustry standard AC cables effectively shield against direct E-field emissions but can not completely\nshield the magnetic component. The configuration of the cables and the leakage of B-fields results in\ninduced E-fields adjacent to the cable independent of burial, owing to magnetic properties (CMACS\n2003). The EM-Field emissions are tiny from a human perspective (see Fristedt, Moren & Soderberg\n2001) but they come within the range of bioelectrical emissions utilised by electrosensitive species. EM-\nFields relating to OREDs with DC cables have yet to be determined, but the focus is likely to be on the\ncurrent transmitted between sea electrodes (see Walker 2001).\nIf the induced E-fields emanating from submarine cables can be detected by electrosensitive species,\nthen at levels that approximate the bioelectric fields of natural prey there is potential for these species to\nbe attracted to them. Whether such species will be attracted or repelled by stronger fields is unknown at\npresent but will be dependent on them passing close to the E-fields (Kalmijn 1982). Elasmobranchs are\nattracted to DC fields in the range 0.005 to 1\u00b5V\/cm and avoid DC fields of approximately 10\u00b5V\/cm or\ngreater (Kalmijn 1982). There is little research to date on the effects of AC E-fields (Kalmijn 1988) and\nonly physiological studies of the frequency of emission detectable by electrosensitive fish (Bodznick &\nBoord 1986; Tricas & New 1998). Such studies suggest that low frequency AC emissions in the\n12\nenvironment are more likely to be detected (Kalmijn 1988). Electrosensitive species may be attracted or\nrepelled by the E-fields, potentially resulting in congregation or dispersal depending on the extent of the\nelectrical environment where multiple cable arrays exist. Therefore, research into the effects of ORED\nrelated E-fields on sensitive species, particularly benthic ones, is required, especially when assessing\nORED environmental impact at important local feeding or breeding grounds, or nursery areas.\nMagnetosensitive species occur in coastal waters worldwide (eg. migratory fish, elasmobranchs,\nmammals, chelonians and crustacea) and these species are thought to be sensitive to the Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfields (Wiltschko & Wiltschko 1995). Whether there is any link between these organisms and the\nmagnetic fields associated with an ORED is again unknown.\nA B-field equal to that of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field (approximately 50\u00b5T) can be detected from DC\nelectricity cables in the Baltic Sea at a distance of six metres (Walker 2001). Such a field can affect a\nship\u2019s compass and has the potential to interact with the navigation and orientation of any animal relying\non the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Any effect may be transient as the organism moves through the area\n(possibly a confusion effect). Alternatively, magnetosensitive species may be attracted to or may\nactively avoid the area. The only published study to date on this subject suggested that the eel Anguilla\nanguilla could detect B-fields emitted by DC cables but only a small proportion of these fish actively\nresponded to them (Westerberg 1999).\nCollision & Avoidance\nOrganisms might collide with or actively avoid the energy generating devices both above and below\nwater depending on the number, size and spacing of devices and their moving parts, and whether the\nwhole ORED is located along an organism\u2019s transit route. Coastal and migratory bird species are thought\nto be most at threat (Garthe & Huppop 2004), particularly species that undertake frequent short, low\nlevel flights between feeding and roosting sites (Dirksen, Spaans & van der Winden 1996). Where large-\n13\nscale migration routes coincide with ORED sites, the potential impact will only occur at certain times of\nthe year. Increases in seasonal and local species mortality have been recorded at onshore wind turbine\nsites (Barrios & Rodriguez 2004).\nAt present little information exists concerning aquatic fauna colliding with or avoiding offshore energy\ngeneration devices. The greatest impact is likely to be upon migrating species where underwater turbines\nare located in enclosed waters such as estuaries (Dadswell & Rulifsen 1994) or where devices form an\nextensive barrier to movement. Any associated effects need to be considered in the context of the\npotential sensitivity of species and behavioural time and energy costs in relation to the location and scale\nof the development (see Garthe & Huppop 2004).\nIndirect ecological effects\nThe extensive scale of OREDs is expected to result in significant displacement of the most mobile fauna\n(fish, marine mammals, marine reptiles, coastal birds and possibly large crustaceans and molluscs)\nduring construction and decommissioning. During operation shifts in the temporal or spatial distribution\nof the mobile fauna or changes in their numbers may also occur as a consequence of changes in the local\nfood web dynamics, species competition, predator-prey relationships and reproduction, which operate at\ndifferent spatial and temporal ecological scales (May 1994).\nFood availability\nBottom-up trophic effects are likely to occur following ORED construction and decommission owing to\nsignificant changes in the type and abundance of benthic species, this in turn will change food\navailability for higher trophic levels. Evidence from fishing and dredging, which operate at similar scales\nto OREDs, suggest that opportunistic fauna will increase to take advantage of species that are displaced\nand vulnerable during physical disturbance. The large scale removal of habitat and species following\ndecommissioning is also likely to alter local food-web dynamics significantly.\n14\nCoastal food resources have a patchy distribution (Hall, Raffaelli & Thrush 1994). The changes to the\nbenthos associated with an ORED will probably increase local food availability and thereby add to the\nnetwork of food patches. The importance of adding to food patches will depend on the extent and\ndistribution of other patches and their connectivity.\nThe energetic requirements of the foraging fauna also need to be taken into account, particularly when\nconsidering the scale of the relationship between individual foragers and food availability (Mann &\nLazier 1996). For example, larval fish are poor swimmers and have low energy reserves so will have a\nhigh dependency on locations with abundant resources at the right time or on short distances between\nfood patches. A cetacean is less ecologically constrained, however, as it is able to move large distances\nbetween feeding areas and can eat a wide range of prey types and sizes. Hence, changes to food\navailability associated with OREDs may affect many species but the effect will be greater for the small,\nmore geographically restricted organisms.\nCompetition\nThe number and extent of OREDs will significantly change the local habitats and present new resource\nopportunities which may increase the use of the area by immigrant fauna. The relative density of\ncompetitors, their competitiveness and availability of alternative opportunities will determine the\necological consequences, but the more adaptable species will be expected to dominate (Milinski &\nParker 1991). Alternatively, if habitat degradation occurs over a wider area causing species aggregation\naround ORED sites, then density-dependent processes resulting from increased competition will be\nlikely to have direct and cascading effects on the local faunal composition (Pimm 1991; Daskalov 2002).\nPredation\n15\nThe significant changes in prey type, size and abundance arising as a result of OREDs are expected to\naffect the predator community. Density dependent and top down predatory effects may result in prey\ndepletion (Pimm 1991) and trophic cascade effects (Pauly et al. 1998; Daskalov 2002). Additionally, if\npredators are perturbed by OREDs and their mechanisms of recovery are slow then predator- or\ncompetitive-release may occur (Pauly et al. 1998; Dulvy, Sadovy & Reynolds 2003). Any changes that\naffect the dynamic link between a predator and its prey may result in reduced allocation of energy to\nother activities (eg. reproduction; refuge) and thereby strongly influence the behaviour of the predator\n(Gill 2003). With large scale OREDs we may therefore see responses in the local predator community\nwhich are additional to direct effects linked with noise and\/or EM-Fields.\nThe ecological effects of competition and predation in coastal waters have been shown to be\nconsiderably altered by existing human activity (Jennings, Kaiser & Reynolds 2001; Ormerod 2003). For\nexample, human impacts on coastal food webs have in some cases directly reduced food for seabirds,\nwhereas in other cases where fishing has removed larger predatory fish, seabirds have gained more food\nresources owing to less competition for the smaller fish which they feed on (Tasker et al. 2000; Atkinson\net al. 2003).\nHence, dynamic processes such as trophic linkage, competition and predation may be altered if the\necological changes associated with large scale deployment of OREDs are equivalent to those resulting\nfrom other industrial scale human activities. Understanding how and when any change will manifest\nitself is crucial; a useful analytical approach could incorporate the effect of human activity into a trophic\nlinkage model of coastal predators and their prey as suggested by Stillman et al. (2001).\nReproduction & recruitment\nThe significant fluctuations in food and habitat availability arising through OREDs could affect species\nreproduction, particularly species already under human pressure. There are examples of parental care\n16\nspecies (eg. seabirds and marine mammals) with reduced breeding success resulting from significant\ndrops in prey abundance as a consequence of fishing (Barrett & Krasnov 1996).\nSpecies with little post-reproduction parental investment could also be affected by local environmental\nchanges linked to OREDs. Many species of fish, for example, use specific spawning and nursery sites.\nDuring ORED construction and decommission early life stages may be vulnerable to burial or removal.\nWater movements could change owing to the presence of a large number of ORED structures. This may\nredistribute new recruits locally or downstream and have wider implications for communities that are\ndriven by species that disperse over regional scales (Kinlan & Gaines 2003).\nHabitat degradation and loss is perhaps the single most effective way of slowing or preventing fish\npopulation recoveries (Dulvy, Sadovy & Reynolds 2003). It is a particular concern when spawning\ngrounds or nursery areas are limited in their availability or extent and the species that rely on them have\nsmall numbers of recruits, long maturation periods (eg. elasmobranchs) and are already being impacted\nby other human activities (Myers & Worm 2003).\nEcological enhancement\nOnce construction of an ORED is completed, the resultant physical structure could be a positive\nenvironmental enhancement due to an increase in the 3-D heterogeneity of the benthic habitat. An\nincrease in habitat represents greater colonisation opportunity for benthos, enhanced survival and\ngrowth, new trophic opportunities, recycling of local energy and refuge for juveniles of mobile species\n(Bohnsack & Sutherland 1985). For the juvenile stages of many species shallow coastal areas are crucial\nfor promoting individual growth, refuge and survival until such time as they are able to recruit to the\nadult population (Gregory & Anderson 1997; Blaber et al. 2000). Habitats with greater physical\nheterogeneity have been shown to be functionally more important and increase fish abundance compared\nto more homogenous areas of the same extent (Jenkins et al. 1997; Charbonnel et al. 2002).\n17\nAlthough no published data exist in the primary scientific literature, there are reports of existing OREDs\nacting as artificial reefs that enhance the local ecosystem around the Baltic Sea coast (BorderWind 1998;\nEcoserve 2000). Fishing records indicate an increase in yields post-construction which is assumed to be\na result of extensive invertebrate colonisation attracting fish (BorderWind 1998; Hoffman et al. 2000).\nThe artificial reef effect therefore appears to offer evidence of a positive impact on the ecology of the\narea where the ORED is located. To be generally ecologically beneficial, however, OREDs must do\nmore than improve local biodiversity. There is a need to determine if enhancement is actually beneficial\nto the existing local populations of species by providing an additional, new source of recruits. Otherwise\nit may create wider problems by recruiting species to the site which would normally replenish the\nspecies populations of existing adjacent habitats on a regular basis. If the ORED acts as an ecological\nenhancement then daily management of operations and particularly removal of habitat during\ndecommissioning will have to take this into account (Fig. 2). By extending this scenario to include\nmultiple adjacent OREDs then ecological changes will need to be determined not only on an ORED by\nORED basis but also a cumulative basis and also include other existing habitats. Hence determination of\nlocal ecosystem connectivity, population (and possibly metapopulation) dynamics and food web\ninteractions will require consideration of factors and processes at different spatial and temporal scales.\nConservation and protected status\nMany coastal areas worldwide have some form of designation for the protection of species or habitats,\nwhile any ORED proposal will be required to consider the potential impact of the development on\nparticular species and\/or habitats. Often the species of concern are birds and mammals or rare or\n\u2018flagship\u2019 species (Simberloff 1998). Unfortunately there is a relatively low priority given to most of the\nremaining coastal flora and fauna. Whilst rare species, birds and mammals have intrinsic appeal,\necologically it is more important to consider impacts on the ecosystem structure and processes and key\nfunctional species (Simberloff 1998). This will require knowledge of which are the key species, how\n18\nthese species are affected as a result of an ORED, species resilience and how the ecosystem dynamics\nwill respond both locally and in the wider context.\nEcological based mitigation\nTrue ecological mitigation has two main attributes: first it compels humans to consider what would\nconstitute an ecological stress; second, it provides us with an opportunity to determine how much of a\nstress we are prepared to allow. For industrial scale OREDs in coastal waters the most important\necological aspects to take into account concern ecosystem structure and function in terms of: habitat loss\nor gain, particularly the balance between species requirements and habitat availability; effects on nutrient\navailability; changes in primary productivity and the consequent effect on production and biomass at\ndifferent trophic levels; altered species diversity and composition; changes in size composition of the\ncommunity; effects on species growth and mortality rate.\nIn order to minimise the impact on existing flora and fauna, ORED sites should have a sparse biological\ncommunity, predominantly comprising opportunistic, resilient, coloniser species. Soft sediment\ncommunities are typically low in diversity and have species that are adapted to naturally unstable habitat\nconditions. However, locations that are used as a migratory or periodic habitat essential for life history\ncompletion should be avoided. There may be a higher diversity of less resilient species at sites with more\nstable substrata and any ORED in such areas will affect a greater component of the ecosystem. Thus,\nfrom the outset, developments should take into consideration the ecological communities present and the\necologically relevant history of the area (e.g. previous degradation). In addition, an ORED should\nconsider and if necessary mitigate against potential ecological problems throughout the construction,\noperation and decommission phases (see Fig. 2).\n19\nIntegrating ecology into ORED plans\nThe stability of coastal ecosystems worldwide is under serious threat, hence OREDs must be planned\nappropriately to protect the ecosystem from further degradation and to enhance it wherever possible.\nEcologists must play a fundamental role in this process. Species may be adapted to a wide range of\nnatural disturbances but disturbance related to OREDs may still have positive or negative effects. As\nHall (1994) points out in relation to fishing, although natural variation may be large this is no basis from\nan ecological stance to suggest that if human development is small it will have no effect.\nAs the number of OREDs increase in the coastal zone, cumulative impact assessments are required to\nprovide spatial and temporal assessment of the environmental impacts by taking account of the\nproximity of existing and planned future developments (Carryer & Deeming 1998).\nThe biggest single problem for the integration of ecology into the planning and decision process for\nOREDs remains the lack of appropriate knowledge. A stepped precautionary approach, such as the\nincremental one used in integrated fishery management (Symes 2000) may most appropriate for\necologically based planning and management of OREDs.\nConclusions\nThere is an urgent need to consider the ecological effects of the large increase in OREDs in the coastal\nzone. Initiatives are required that facilitate offshore renewable energy developments with due regard to\necological considerations and natural processes. This will require a wide ranging perspective, adaptable\nmonitoring and research based on our best understanding of coastal ecology necessary to sustain the\necosystem composition, structure and function, whilst also assisting the wider goal of global carbon\nmanagement. Ecology needs to be part of the process of OREDs and at the same time offshore energy\nextractors need to be made aware of their role within the coastal ecosystem.\n20\nAcknowledgements\nAbigail Casey, Jim Harris, Ian Gloyne-Phillips , Joe Spencer, Gordon Jones, Yi Huang, Gero Vella and\nCranfield University colleagues who have discussed or contributed to many of the complex issues\nhighlighted in this paper.
