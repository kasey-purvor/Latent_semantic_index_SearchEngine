Introduction\nChorus emissions are naturally-produced electromagnetic waves in the ELF\/VLF (\u223c29\n0.1\u2212 10 kHz) frequency range [e.g. reviews by Omura et al., 1991; Sazhin and Hayakawa,30\n1992], that occur outside the plasmapause predominantly in the dawn sector, and rank31\namong the most intense whistler-mode emissions in the inner magnetosphere [Koons and32\nRoeder, 1990; Meredith et al., 2001; Santolik et al., 2004]. They typically occur in a series of33\nshort (\u223c 0.1 sec), rising tones (though falling and mixed tones are also observed) between34\n\u223c 0.2\u2212 2 kHz\/s, in two distinct frequency bands that peak in power near 0.34fce (lower35\nband) and 0.53fce (upper band), where fce is the equatorial gyrofrequency along that field-36\nline [Burtis and Helliwell, 1969, 1976], and exhibit a wave power minimum near 0.5fce37\n[Tsurutani and Smith, 1974; Koons and Roeder, 1990]. Chorus intensity and occurrence38\nare directly related to geomagnetic activity [Storey, 1953; Tsurutani and Smith, 1974;39\nBurtis and Helliwell, 1976; Meredith et al., 2001; 2003; Santolik et al., 2003, 2004; Smith40\net al., 1999; 2004; Spasojevic and Inan, 2005] and it is generally agreed that the generation41\nmechanism involves cyclotron resonance with eastward-drifting, freshly-injected, unstable42\nelectron populations in the \u223c 10\u2212100 keV range, though the exact generation mechanism43\nremains a topic of intense research [Helliwell, 1967, 1995; Omura et al., 1991; Hattori et44\nal., 1991; Sazhin and Hayakawa, 1992; Trakhtengerts, 1995, 1999; Nunn et al., 1997].45\nThough chorus has been actively studied for well over 50 years [Storey, 1953], it has46\nrecently enjoyed a resurgence of interest due to the recognition of its importance in control-47\nling radiation-belt dynamics [e.g., Horne and Thorne, 1998; Summers et al., 1998, 2004;48\nHorne et al., 2003, 2005a,b; Thorne et al. 2005a,b; Spasojevic and Inan, 2005; Meredith et49\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 4 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nal., 2002a,b; 2003b; Miyoshi et al., 2003; Lyons et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2004; Varotsou50\net al., 2005; Shprits et al., 2006] playing a dual role in both the precipitation and accel-51\neration of radiation-belt electrons [Horne and Thorne, 2003; Horne et al., 2005b; Bortnik52\nand Thorne, 2006]. In the scenario described in the above works, lower energy electrons53\n(\u223c 10 \u2212 100 keV) generate chorus near the geomagnetic equator through the loss-cone54\ninstability and thermal anisotropy, and scatter these electrons into the loss-cone in the55\nprocess, resulting in decreased fluxes [Ibid]. The locally generated waves also interact with56\nhigher energy electrons at large pitch-angles, contributing to the acceleration of electrons57\nto relativistic energies [e.g. Meredith et al., 2002a; Horne and Thorne, 2003]. Chorus58\nwaves then propagate to higher latitudes, where they resonate with relativistic (MeV)59\nelectrons leading to both microburst precipitation, and further acceleration of trapped60\nrelativistic electrons [Horne and Thorne, 2003; Horne et al., 2005b]. Chorus thus plays a61\nmediating role, transferring energy from the abundant lower energy electron population62\nto the smaller population of higher energy electrons [e.g., Thorne et al., 2005b; Horne et63\nal., 2006]. In order to properly quantify this mediation process, it is important to under-64\nstand the propagation characteristics of chorus, its wave normal evolution, damping, and65\nresultant distribution of power with respect to latitude, L-shell, and magnetic local time66\n(MLT).67\nPrevious studies have shown that chorus typically occurs between 3 < L < 9, with68\na peak at 6 < L < 8 [Tsurutani and Smith, 1974; Burtis and Helliwell, 1976; Meredith69\net al., 2001], in the dawn and afternoon sectors, moving to higher L-shells and\/or lat-70\nitudes when moving towards the day side [Burtis and Helliwell, 1976; Meredith et al.,71\n2001]. Wave normal studies show that near the geomagnetic equator, the k-vector is72\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 5\npredominantly field-aligned [Burton and Holzer, 1974; Goldstein and Tsurutani, 1984]73\nin agreement with theoretical predictions [Kennel and Thorne, 1967] but becomes pro-74\ngressively more oblique as it propagates away from the equatorial generation region in75\na non-ducted mode [Thorne and Kennel, 1967; Burton and Holzer, 1974; Goldstein and76\nTsurutani, 1984]. However, recent observations of chorus, particularly at off-equatorial77\npositions, indicate that generation may have occurred at much higher wave normal angles78\n[Lauben et al., 2002; Chum and Santolik, 2005; Santolik et al., 2006]. In both cases, prop-79\nagation is found to be away from the equatorial region [LeDocq et al., 1998; Lauben et al.,80\n2002; Santolik et al., 2004, 2005], with very few exceptions where weak magnetospheric81\nreflections have been observed [Maeda and Smith, 1981; Parrot et al., 2003, 2004]. There82\nis strong support for the fact that propagation is predominantly nonducted [e.g., Burton83\nand Holzer, 1974; Goldstein and Tsurutani, 1984; Lauben et al., 2002; Chum et al., 2005]84\nand apparently limited by Landau damping [Bortnik et al., 2006] to propagation ranges85\nof 10\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 in latitude [Burtis and Helliwell, 1976; Meredith et al., 2001].86\nThe relation of chorus morphology to the storm-time injection and dispersive (eastward)87\nazimuthal drift of energetic electrons has been well-noted by past workers [Anderson and88\nMaeda, 1977; Collier and Hughes, 2004a,b; Smith et al., 2004; Abel et al., 2006; Lubchich89\net al., 2006], where the electrons were treated as the source of the chorus waves. In90\nthe present work, we neglect all aspects of the wave generation process, and consider91\nonly the (linear) Landau damping of the chorus waves as they propagate in an unducted92\nmode away from their source region. Specifically, we examine the effects of suprathermal93\nelectron fluxes upon chorus propagation characteristics using a combination of measured94\nfluxes, ray tracing, and comparison to wave data. In Section 2, statistical averages of95\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 6 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nsuprathermal fluxes from the CRRES satellite are presented, parameterized by MLT, L-96\nshell, and geomagnetic activity (Sec. 2.1), and analytical phase space density functions97\nare fitted to these measurements (Sec. 2.2). In Section 3 the ray tracing and Landau98\ndamping methodology is presented using a single ray (Sec. 3.1), and the results of ray99\ntracing a large distribution of rays are shown (Sec. 3.2). The ray tracing results are100\ncompared to chorus wave measurements made on the CRRES satellite in Section 4, in101\nterms of geomagnetic activity dependence (Sec. 4.1) and frequency dependence (Sec. 4.2),102\nand the agreement and limitations of our model are discussed in Section 5. The major103\nfindings of this work are summarized in Section 6.104\n2. The CRRES satellite and database\nThe Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) [Johnson et al., 1992] is105\nparticularly well-suited for the present study due to its favorable orbit and instrumentation106\nsuite, and is used to provide information on the suprathermal electron fluxes, as well as107\nchorus wave intensities (discussed further in Section 4). The spacecraft was launched on108\nJuly 25, 1990 and operated in a highly elliptical geosynchronous transfer orbit with a109\nperigee of 305 km, an apogee of 35,768 km, and an inclination of 18\u25e6. The orbital period110\nwas approximately 10 hours, and the initial apogee was at a magnetic local time (MLT)111\nof 0800 MLT. The magnetic local time of apogee decreased at a rate of approximately 1.3112\nhours per month until the satellite failed on October 11, 1991, when the apogee was at113\napproximately 1400 MLT. The satellite swept through the most important chorus source114\nregion approximately 5 times per day, providing coverage for almost 15 months.115\nThe suprathermal electron fluxes were measured by the Low Energy Plasma Analyzer116\n(LEPA). This instrument consisted of two electrostatic analyzers with microchannel plate117\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 7\ndetectors, each with a field of view of 120\u25e6 \u00d7 5\u25e6, one measuring electrons and the other118\nions in the energy range 100 eV < E < 30 keV [Hardy et al., 1993]. The instrument119\ndetected the complete pitch angle range from 0\u25e6 to 180\u25e6 every 30 sec with a resolution of120\n5.625\u25e6 \u00d7 8\u25e6 at 20 energy channels in the range 100 eV < E < 30 keV. The chorus waves121\nwere measured by the Plasma Wave Experiment (PWE) which detected the wave electric122\nfield from 5.6 Hz to 400 kHz, using a 100 m tip-to-tip long wire antenna, with a dynamic123\nrange covering a factor of at least 105 in amplitude [Anderson et al., 1992].124\nIn order to examine the global morphology of the suprathermal electron fluxes and the125\nchorus wave intensities as a function of geomagnetic activity we constructed a database126\nfrom the CRRES wave and particle observations. The wave data were initially corrected127\nfor the instrumental background response and smoothed by using a running 3-min average128\nto take out the beating effects due to differences in the sampling and the spin rate.129\nSpurious data points, data spikes, and periods of instrumental downtime were flagged and130\nignored in the subsequent statistical analyses. Twelve orbits, during which nontraditional131\nconfigurations were deployed for testing purposes, were also excluded from the analyses.132\nThe electric field intensities, discussed in Section 4, together with the electron perpen-133\ndicular differential number flux for each energy level of the LEPA instrument were then134\nrebinned as a function of half orbit (outbound and inbound) and L in steps of 0.1L.135\nThe data were recorded together with the universal time (UT), magnetic latitude (\u03bbm),136\nmagnetic local time (MLT), the AE index, and time spent in each bin with the same137\nresolution. The resulting database, consisting of plasma wave and particle measurements138\nfrom 939 orbits (1878 half orbits), was subsequently analyzed to determine the behavior139\nof the waves and the particles as a function of spatial location and magnetic activity.140\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 8 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nBoth whistler mode chorus and the suprathermal electrons tend to be observed outside141\nof the plasmapause. In order to exclude wave emissions and electron fluxes from inside the142\nplasmapause from the survey we adopt a criterion based on the amplitude of the waves in143\nthe band fce < f < 2fce following [Meredith et al., 2004]. Waves in this frequency band,144\nwhich contain contributions from both electron cyclotron harmonic waves and thermal145\nnoise, tend to be excluded from the high density region inside the plasmapause, and have146\nproven to be an excellent indicator of times when the satellite is outside the plasmapshere.147\nThe specific criterion we adopt, based on a previous experimental study using data from148\nthe CRRES Plasma Wave Experiment, requires that the wave amplitude for frequencies149\nin the range fce < f < 2fce be greater than 0.0005 mVm\n\u22121 in order for the wave and150\nparticle data to be included in the survey [Meredith et al., 2004].151\n2.1. Suprathermal flux observations\nFigure 1 shows the average distribution of perpendicular suprathermal electron fluxes152\nmeasured with LEPA on the CRRES satellite, averaged over a range of magnetic latitudes153\nwithin \u00b115\u25e6 of the magnetic equator. Each panel displays fluxes in color as a function154\nof L-shell and MLT, with the common colorbar shown at the bottom of the figure. The155\nfluxes are parameterized by energy channel and geomagnetic activity, showing (rows from156\ntop to bottom) the 213 eV, 1.09 keV, 4.25 keV and 16.5 keV channels, for the magnetic157\nactivity conditions (columns from left to right) AE < 100 nT, 100 < AE < 300 nT,158\nand AE > 300 nT. The statistical coverage of CRRES is shown at the bottom of each159\ncolumn, as the number of samples in each L-MLT bin. These specific energy channels160\nhave been chosen for a number of reasons: firstly, the range 0.213\u201316.5 keV was chosen161\nbecause the suprathermal electron energies responsible for Landau damping of chorus162\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 9\nwaves fall comfortably within it, typically near \u223c 1 keV [e.g., Bortnik and Thorne, 2006,163\nFig. 3d]. Secondly, the choice of using only four of the energy channels available on164\nCRRES was made because it is the smallest number of points the gives a robust parameter165\nfit (discussed further below) and adding more data has little or no further effect upon the166\nfitted distribution, but only increases computation length. The spacing of energy channels167\nwas chosen to be roughly even on a logarithmic scale, in both energy and velocity space168\n(see for example Figure 2).169\nThe flux distributions show that suprathermal fluxes at all energies increase with in-170\ncreasing geomagnetic activity, and penetrate to lower L-shells, due to the enhanced con-171\nvection electric field [e.g., Korth et al., 1999]. The MLT distributions also become more172\nasymmetric with increasing geomagnetic activity, due to increases in both electron injec-173\ntion, and loss as they drift eastward around the Earth. Low energy (< 16 keV) electrons174\nare subject to strong diffusion loss during resonance with electrostatic electron cyclotron175\nharmonic (ECH) waves [Horne and Thorne, 2000] and whistler-mode chorus [Glauert and176\nHorne, 2005]. The loss timescale for strong diffusion is considerably shorter than the drift177\ntimescale at these energies, giving rise to strong MLT gradients.178\nIt should be noted that a few L-MLT bins do not contain particle data due to incomplete179\ncoverage by CRRES (e.g., 4 < L < 5, 2300 < MLT < 0000, and L > 6 at 0900 < MLT180\n< 1200). While we have taken measures to avoid most regions with insufficient coverage,181\nfor example only considering the region 3 < L < 7 in subsequent analysis, a few such182\nregions still remain. This problem has been addressed by smoothing and interpolating183\nthe data in logarithmic space over the 2D plane. A number of different techniques of data184\nfilling have been compared including more elaborate techniques [Kondrashov and Ghil,185\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 10 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\n2006], but since our data set is fairly smooth (particularly when the logarithm is used for186\ninterpolation), the results obtained using the various methods agreed fairly well, and a187\nsimple triangle interpolation scheme, using a gradient regularizer was chosen.188\n2.2. Parameter fitting\nWe aim to fit analytical functions representing the phase space density as a function189\nof velocity, f(v), to the suprathermal flux observations shown in Figure 1, at every L,190\nand MLT bin. The fitted f(v) functions can subsequently be used to calculate Landau191\ndamping rates when combined with ray tracing. In order to illustrate our methodology, a192\nspecific location is chosen, e.g., L = 4.45, MLT= 5.5, together with a geomagnetic activity193\nlevel, e.g., AE > 300 nT, giving the 4 measured flux values (J1\u22124) corresponding to the194\n4 energy channels (E1\u22124 = 0.213, 1.09, 4.25, and 16.5 keV), illustrated as the diamond195\nsymbols in Figure 2a. If an assumed distribution of the form:196\nJ(E) =\nJ0\nEm\n(1)197\nis used, the J0 and m values can be readily obtained by taking the logarithm of (1),198\nlog10(Ji)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nyi\n= log10(J0)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\na0\n\u2212 m\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\na1\nlog10(Ei)\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nxi\n(2)199\nand solving for a0, a1 in (2) in a least-squares sense [Press et al., 2002, p.661] where200\n(Ei, Ji) or (xi, yi), i = 1\u2212 4, are the data points. The overall goodness of fit is estimated201\nby the sum of squared residuals between the fitted curve and actual data points. The202\nleast-squares fit described above is shown in Figure 2a as the solid, heavy line, with the203\nfit-parameters J0 = 2.14 \u00d7 107 cm\u22122s\u22121str\u22121keV\u22121, and m = 0.755. For comparison,204\nthe data points are joined with a dashed line in Figure 2a, showing that the agreement205\nbetween data and fitted model is very good.206\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 11\nThe flux J(E) can be related to the phase space density f(v) through the simple non-207\nrelativistic relation [Walt, 1994, p. 67]:208\nJ(E) =\nv2\nm\u2032\nf(v) (3)209\nwhere v and m\u2032 are the electron velocity and mass respectively, but care must be exercised210\nwith regard to the selection of units.

Ray tracing and Landau damping\nThe fitted distribution discussed in Section 2.2 can now be combined with ray tracing to232\nstudy the propagation characteristics of chorus. We use the same methodology as Bortnik233\net al. [2006], which is illustrated in Figure 3.234\n3.1. Ray tracing methodology\nUsing the Stanford VLF raytracer [Inan and Bell, 1977], individual rays representative235\nof chorus waves are injected at the magnetic equatorial plane (\u03bb = 0\u25e6), with an initial236\nwave normal angle \u03c8 = 0\u25e6, at a given L-shell, MLT, and frequency f which is normalized237\nto the equatorial gyrofrequency fce. For example, Figure 3a shows the propagation of a238\nsingle ray in the meridional plane, injected at L = 4.45, \u03bb = 0\u25e6, \u03c8 = 0\u25e6, and f = 0.3fce.239\nIn the course of the ray propagation, the appropriate suprathermal distribution f(v) is240\nused to calculate the Landau damping rate at every point along the ray path [Brinca,241\n1972; Bortnik et al., 2003], and integrated to give the total damping of the ray. Figure242\n3b shows the total damping calculated for the ray in panel (a), using the corresponding243\ndistribution illustrated in Figure 2b (solid line) as a function of group time, together with244\nthe latitude of the ray (dashed line). The point where the ray power reaches 1% of its245\ninitial value is considered to be the termination of the wave, and the corresponding final246\ntime \u03c4f and final latitude \u03bbf are indicated on the figure. In the present case shown in247\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 13\nFigure 3b, \u03c4f = 0.0971 sec, \u03bbf = 16.34\n\u25e6, and in Figure 3a the ray path is only shown until248\nthe termination point, also indicating the final propagation distance df = 1.28RE.249\nWe note that the since we only have comprehensive information on perpendicular250\nsuprathermal fluxes (Figure 1), the pitch-angle distribution is not known for all cases,251\nso it is assumed to be isotropic for simplicity. This assumption is consistent with past252\nwork which has indicated that suprathermal fluxes are generally isotropic [Bell et al.,253\n2002], and even if some anisotropy is present, it does not affect the Landau damping rates254\nappreciably [Thorne and Horne, 1994]. The assumption of suprathermal flux isotropy255\nis particularly valid during active times (which are of most interest to us in the present256\nstudy) when the presence of intense waves tends to isotropise the electron distribution257\n[Asnes et al., 2005] at lower energies.258\nIn Figure 3c, the wave normal angle of the ray is shown as a function of latitude, to259\nthe point of termination at \u03bbf = 16.34\n\u25e6. Even though the ray propagates for a relatively260\nshort distance, it should be noted that the wave normal angle rotates to relatively high261\nvalues \u03c8 \u223c 50\u25e6 in the course of its lifetime, which accelerate its damping (c.f. Figure 3b)262\n[Brinca, 1972; Thorne and Horne, 1994].263\nWe note that in Figure 3, and all subsequent ray tracing simulations in the present study,264\nthe B-field model was assumed to be a simple dipole, and the equatorial gyrofrequency265\nfce is shown as the dashed line in Figure 3d. The equatorial number density was modeled266\nafter Carpenter and Anderson [1992], with the plasmapause set at Lpp \u223c 2.5 corresponding267\nto geomagnetic activity levels with Kmaxp \u223c 6.7 (maximum value of Kp in the preceeding268\n24 hours). Off-equatorial values were calculated using the diffusive equilibrium model269\n[Angerami and Thomas, 1964].270\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 14 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\n3.2. Calculation results\nThe single ray example illustrated in Figure 3 can be repeated multiple times, in each271\ncase varying one of the initial parameters (e.g., L, MLT, AE, f , etc.), and the effect272\nobserved in the propagation parameters (e.g., \u03c4f , \u03bbf , df ). The results of this analysis are273\nshown in Figure 4, where the final latitude \u03bbf of each ray is plotted as a function of its274\ninitial L-shell and MLT, parameterized into 3 columns representing geomagnetic activity275\n(corresponding to Figure 1), and 4 rows corresponding to the ray frequency normalized276\nto the equatorial gyrofrequency (please note the colorbar is different for each row). The277\nfrequencies have been chosen to represent chorus rays ranging from the lowest observed278\nvalues (row A, f = 0.1fce), through typical lower band (row B, f = 0.3fce) and upper279\nband (row C, f = 0.5fce), to the highest observed frequencies (row D, f = 0.7fce).280\nThe initial wave normal angle was set to \u03c8 = 0\u25e6 in all the simulations. The values at281\nL \u223c 5 \u2212 7, MLT \u223c 0900 \u2212 1200 (indicated by the dashed oval in panel (Ab)) should be282\ninterpreted with caution since this region corresponds to interpolated fluxes (c.f. Figure283\n1, Section 2.1). The dark blue regions appearing at low L-shells in panels (Aa) and284\n(Ac), MLT=1600 and 0600 respectively, correspond to rays that are able to undergo a285\nmagnetospheric reflection [e.g., Parrot et al., 2003; 2004; Bortnik et al., 2006] and return286\nto low latitudes before being extinguished, due to the very low damping (corresponding to287\nlow frequency of the wave) and low L-shell, as discussed further below. Since our density288\nprofile was fixed in all simulations (e.g. Figure 3d), the expected average location of the289\nplasmapause Lpp was marked explicitly in columns a and b, with Lpp \u223c 5.1 corresponding290\nto Kmaxp \u223c 1 in column a, Lpp \u223c 3.75 corresponding to Kmaxp \u223c 4 in column b [Carpenter291\nand Anderson, 1992], and Lpp = 2.5 in column c as shown in Figure 3d. The chosen K\nmax\np292\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 15\nvalues are not necessarily proportional to the corresponding AE ranges, but are typical of293\nquiet, moderately disturbed, and disturbed conditions, and are likely to be encountered294\nin the given AE ranges. Since chorus is typically observed outside the plasmapause [e.g.,295\nAnderson and Maeda, 1977], only values at L > Lpp should be considered valid in the296\nfollowing discussion.297\nThere are a number of features evident in Figure 4 which we discuss below. Firstly, in298\neach panel it is evident that rays initiated at lower L-shells propagate to higher latitudes299\nthan those starting at higher L-shells, regardless of AE or f , for example in panel (Bc),300\n\u03bbf (L < 4) \u223c 30\u25e6 whereas \u03bbf (L > 6) \u223c 10\u25e6. The same behavior (not shown) is also evident301\nfor the final propagation distance df , confirming that this is a real damping effect is not302\njust a result of longer field-lines at higher L-shells. This behavior is related to the fact303\nthat damping rates are proportional to Nh\/N0 [Brinca, 1972], where Nh is the number304\nof \u2018hot\u2019 particles, i.e., suprathermal flux, and N0 is the background cold plasma density.305\nSince convective injection of hot particles into the inner magnetosphere is more efficient306\nat higher L than lower L, and cold plasma density is higher at lower L than at higher307\nL (Figure 3d), the ratio Nh\/N0 is lower at lower L, corresponding to larger \u03bbf , and vice308\nversa at higher L.309\nThe second feature to note is that in all panels, independent of AE or f , the rays are310\ncompletely damped while they are still propagating away from the equator, and thus (typ-311\nically) do not magnetospherically reflect and return to the equator. This unidirectional312\npropagation away from the equator has been well-noted in experimental studies [LeDocq313\net al., 1998; Lauben et al., 2002; Santolik et al., 2004, 2005], and previously explained on314\nthe basis of Landau damping [Bortnik et al., 2006] (though only a single hypothesized315\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 16 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nsuprathermal distribution was used in that case). In the present study, the unidirectional316\npropagation of chorus is confirmed using measured, local flux distributions.317\nThe MLT distribution of \u03bbf exhibits a distinct progression at all frequencies when318\ngeomagnetic activity is increased from quiet times (column a) to disturbed times (column319\nc). For example, examining \u03bbf at a location of +1 L-shell outside the plasmapause,320\nin panel (Ba) it is clear that \u03bbf (L = 6) \u223c 15\u25e6 and relatively independent of MLT,321\nwith perhaps slightly increased values near midnight. Comparing to panel (Bc), \u03bbf (L =322\n3.5,MLT= 0000) \u223c 27\u25e6, and \u03bbf (L = 3.5,MLT= 1200) \u223c 40\u25e6, there is a pronounced MLT323\ndependence at all L and f , with low values near midnight, increasing with MLT towards324\nnoon, peaking postnoon and returning to low values again at night. This geomagnetically325\ncontrolled MLT dependence is related to the drift and loss timescales of suprathermal326\nelectrons which ultimately control the damping of the chorus waves, and will be discussed327\nfurther in Section 5.328\nFinally, we note that \u03bbf is strongly frequency dependent, regardless of AE, MLT or329\nL-shell. Lower frequency components (row A) propagate furthest, with \u03bbf decreas-330\ning as the frequency is increased (e.g., row D). For example, at L = 4, MLT=1200,331\nAE> 300 nT, \u03bbf (f = 0.1fce) \u223c 56\u25e6, \u03bbf (f = 0.3fce) \u223c 28\u25e6, \u03bbf (f = 0.5fce) \u223c 15\u25e6, and332\n\u03bbf (f = 0.7fce) \u223c 7.5\u25e6. The tendency of higher frequencies to Landau damp more severely333\nhas been previously noted [Thorne and Horne, 1994; Bortnik et al., 2003] in relation to334\nmagnetospherically reflected whistler propagation studies, and is due to the combination335\nthat (i) higher frequency waves resonate with lower energy electrons which are more abun-336\ndant (and have larger values of \u2202f\/\u2202v||), and (ii) that higher frequency waves also rotate337\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 17\nfaster to the resonance cone, which which is at lower angles than for lower frequency338\nwaves.339\n4. Comparison to observations\nIn order to compare our simulated results to observations we use the CRRES wave340\ndata, processed and rebinned as described in Section 2. Only the wave data inferred to be341\noutside the plasmapause are included, by adopting the criterion that the wave amplitude342\nfor frequencies in the range fce < f < 2fce must be greater than 0.0005 mVm\n\u22121 [e.g.,343\nMeredith et al., 2004]. For the present comparison, the chorus wave intensities were defined344\nby integrals of the averaged wave spectral density (V2 m\u22122 Hz\u22121) over the frequency range345\n0.1fce < f < 1.0fce in steps of 0.1fce, where fce is the equatorial electron gyrofrequency346\nas above. The gyrofrequency fce was determined from the local ambient magnetic field347\ndetermined from the fluxgate magnetometer instrument [Singer et al., 1992] assuming a348\ndipole field.349\n4.1. Dependence on geomagnetic activity\nIn Figure 5 we show the chorus wave power binned as a function of L-shell and MLT,350\nparamterized by magnetic latitude range (rows 1\u20133: |\u03bbm| > 20\u25e6, 10\u25e6 < |\u03bbm| < 20\u25e6,351\n|\u03bbm| < 10\u25e6) and geomagnetic activity (columns 1\u20133: AE < 100 nT, 100 < AE < 300352\nnT, and AE > 300 nT). The two lowest frequency components are shown, since these are353\nexpected to experience the least amount of damping (c.f., Figure 4). The 9 panels on354\nthe left correspond to the frequency range 0.1fce < f < 0.2fce and the 9 on the right to355\n0.2fce < f < 0.3fce, with a dashed line showing the separation.356\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 18 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nImmediately evident is the strong degree of geomagnetic control of chorus intensity.357\nDuring active times (column 3), the chorus wave power is \u223c 1000 times stronger than358\nduring quiet times (column 1), since the energetic particles that drive chorus emissions359\n(E \u223c 10 \u2212 100 keV) are only injected when strong convection electric fields are present360\nduring active conditions [Smith et al., 1999, 2004; Collier and Hughes, 2004a,b]. The MLT361\ndependence during quiet times is weak, in agreement with our theoretical predictions.362\nDuring active times, there is a pronounced MLT dependence: at low latitudes, mid-363\nlatitudes, and high latitudes the chorus wave power is observed predominantly at MLTlow\u03bb364\n\u223c 2300 \u2212 0800, MLTmid\u03bb \u223c 0100 \u2212 1400, and MLThigh\u03bb \u223c 0700 \u2212 1500 respectively (for365\n0.2fce < f < 0.3fce). There is a clear tendency of the wave power to progressively366\nshift to high latitudes as MLT is increased, in direct agreement with our \u2018active time\u2019367\ncalculations (Figure 4, column c). Beyond MLT \u223c 1500 the chorus power abruptly drops368\noff, presumably due to the loss of the energetic electrons which are the source of the waves.369\n4.2. Storm-time chorus distributions\nIn Figure 6 we show the distribution of chorus wave power for active conditions (i.e.,370\ncolumn 3 of Figure 4, AE > 300 nT), parameterized by magnetic latitude range (rows371\n1\u20133: |\u03bbm| > 20\u25e6, 10\u25e6 < |\u03bbm| < 20\u25e6, |\u03bbm| < 10\u25e6) and frequency band, normalized to the372\nequatorial electron cyclotron frequency (columns 1\u20136: f\/fce = 0.1\u20130.2, 0.2\u20130.3, 0.3\u20130.4,373\n0.4\u20130.5, 0.5\u20130.6, and 0.6\u20130.7).374\nThe tendency of chorus wave power to move to higher latitudes with increasing MLT is375\nclearly evident at all frequency ranges, in agreement with our calculations. In addition, if376\nwe contrast a low frequency component (e.g., column 2, 0.2fce < f < 0.3fce), with a high377\nfrequency component (e.g., column 5, 0.5fce < f < 0.6fce), it is clear that significantly378\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 19\nless power is able to propagate to high latitudes when the frequency is high, compared379\nto when the frequency is low. This supports our theoretical prediction that Landau380\ndamping controls the latitude to which chorus waves are able to propagate, indicating381\nlarger damping at higher frequencies.382\nBy studying the L-shell distribution of the wave power, for example row 2, columns383\n4\u20136, it is apparent that the chorus wave power is able to propagate to higher latitudes at384\nlower L-shells, in accordance with our prediction. We note that the ability to observe this385\nL-shell distribution is also consistent with our model, and should only be evident above386\nf \u223c 0.5fce where \u03bbf falls in the range 10\u25e6 \u2212 20\u25e6 (c.f., Figure 4), whereas lower frequency387\ncomponents have \u03bbf > 20\n\u25e6 for most of the L-shells under study, which all fall into the388\nhighest latitude bin observed by CRRES. The fact that chorus wave power is observed389\nonly outside of L \u223c 3 is attributed to the location of the plasmapause.390\n5. Discussion\nIn the foregoing comparison, it was demonstrated that many of the observed character-391\nistics of the chorus wave-power distribution could be successfully explained on the basis392\nof Landau damping by the suprathermal electron (\u223c 1 keV) population. In particular,393\nthe tendency of lower frequency components to propagate to higher latitudes than higher394\nfrequency components was clearly shown in both our simulations and the CRRES data.395\nThe fact that chorus waves are Landau damped during their first hop away from the396\nequator (unidirectional propagation) support previous theoretical [Bortnik et al., 2006]397\nand observational [LeDocq et al., 1998; Lauben et al., 2002] studies (although a few obser-398\nvations of weak, magnetospherically reflected chorus have been made [Maeda and Smith,399\n1981; Parrot et al., 2003; 2004]), and the approximate final latitude to which various fre-400\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 20 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nquencies propagated was consistent with the CRRES data. The tendency of chorus waves401\nto propagate to larger \u03bbf at lower L-shells was predicted in our simulations and observed402\nin the CRRES data.403\nOf particular interest was the agreement in the MLT distribution of chorus wave power,404\nas observed at various latitudinal ranges. In both our theoretical predictions and CRRES405\ndata it was shown that chorus waves tend to be more confined to low latitudes on the406\nnightside. The accessible latitude range of chorus increases with MLT, and peaks on the407\ndayside. This propagation characteristic was attributed purely to the behavior of the408\nsuprathermal flux distribution.409\nIn Figure 7 the controlling influence of the suprathermal electron distribution upon410\nwave propagation is demonstrated, by plotting the fitted flux distribution (1) at L = 4.85411\nas a function of MLT and E (Figure 7e), where the region MLT=1000-1100 corresponds412\nto incomplete CRRES coverage. The ray paths (plotted from initiation to their respective413\ntermination points) at 4 selected MLT locations are shown in Figures 7a-d, corresponding414\nto MLT = 3.5, 9.5, 15.5 and 21.5 respectively. The flux fitting parameters J0 and m415\n(Eqn. (1)) are shown in Figures 7f,g and the corresponding phase space density fitting416\nparameters AN and n are shown in Figures 7h,i.417\nFigure 7e shows that J(E) varies strongly as a function of MLT. When J(E) is most418\nintense, Landau damping is the most severe and propagation latitudes are the shortest419\n(Figure 7a). As MLT increases, J(E) is decreased due to scattering and loss by a number of420\nplasma waves (including chorus) [Korth et al., 1999; Horne et al., 2003; Chen et al, 2005]421\nand propagation lengths increase (Figure 7b), reaching a maximum at postnoon MLT422\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 21\n(Figure 7c). Thereafter, J(E) again increases towards the nightside with corresponding423\nincrease in damping (Figure 7d).424\nOur interpretation of the flux decrease is illustrated schematically in Figure 7j, which425\nshows the convective injection of suprathermal electrons from the plasmasheet, followed by426\na combination of gradient-curvature, and E\u00d7B drift which causes the electrons to drift427\nin an eastward direction around the Earth. During their drift trajectories, the electrons428\nexperience scattering by a variety of plasma waves which cause losses on a timescale429\ncomparable to the strong diffusion lifetime [Horne and Thorne, 2000; Glauert and Horne,430\n2005] which is shorter than the drift period of the electrons, and hence the suprathermal431\nelectron population is not able to complete a full drift around the Earth (on average).432\nMoreover, by examining Figures 7f and 7g (or alternatively Figures 7h and 7i), it is clear433\nthat not only the absolute value of the flux, J0, is decreased, but the spectrum becomes434\nsteeper since m progressively increases with MLT. This indicates that electrons with E < 1435\nkeV and E > 1 keV experience different scattering rates relative to their drift timescales,436\nwith the higher energy electrons being scattered faster than the lower energy electrons.437\nThe steepening of the spectrum J(E) slightly increases damping rates with MLT, but438\nis dominated by the decrease in J0 which drives damping rates to very low values. The439\ntendency of lower energy electrons to propagate further in MLT is shown schematically440\nin Figure 7j.441\nEven though many propagation characteristics of chorus are successfully reproduced442\nby our model, there are a few limitations which warrant discussion. Firstly, in all our443\nsimulations only the relative power of each ray was considered (Figure 3b), which implicitly444\nassumes a uniform source of chorus waves, and neglects any inherent MLT variation in445\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 22 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nthe source. This difference becomes apparent in comparing our simulation (e.g., Figure446\n4, panel Bc, L > 5) with the observations (e.g., Figure 6, column 3) where it is clear that447\nchorus wave power drops off dramatically beyond MLT \u223c 1500, whereas the simulations448\nshow the \u03bbf continues to increase until MLT \u223c 1800. This difference is attributed to the449\nfact that the flux of electrons responsible for the generation of chorus E \u223c 10\u2212 100 keV450\nis not uniformly distributed in MLT, but also drifts around the Earth and is scattered by451\nvarious waves, decreasing both its absolute flux levels, as well as decreasing the anisotropy452\nin the pitch-angle distribution which is presumably the source of free-energy that creates453\nthe chorus waves [Burton, 1976]. By the time the source electrons reach MLT \u223c 1500 there454\nis insufficient flux and anisotropy to drive chorus generation and the wave power drops off455\ndramatically, even though propagation lengths remain high, implying that if there were456\nany chorus waves being generated, they would have propagated to large latitudes.457\nSecondly, in our simulations we have assumed that chorus waves are generated in a field-458\naligned \u03c8 = 0\u25e6 direction, due to the fact that cyclotron growth rates are maximized, and459\nLandau damping rates are minimized in this configuration [Kennel, 1966; Brinca, 1972].460\nIn addition, many observational studies have indicated that chorus is indeed observed to461\nbe predominantly field-aligned near its source [Burton and Holzer, 1974; Goldstein and462\nTsurutani, 1984]. While there is evidence of whistler wave-power leaking into a spectrum463\nof non-zero wave normal angles [Lauben et al., 2002; Chum and Santolik, 2005; Santolik et464\nal., 2006; Platino et al, 2006], it appears that the bulk of the wave power is indeed initiated465\nin a field-aligned orientation, and the observed large-scale characteristics reported in this466\npaper are consistent with this generation regime.467\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 23\nFinally, we note that in our simulation we have assumed that chorus waves are instan-468\ntaneously produced at the geomagnetic equator and then propagate away, which is an469\noverly simplistic treatment of the chorus generation problem [a very complicated problem470\nindeed! e.g., Helliwell, 1967, 1995; Omura et al., 1991; Hattori et al., 1991; Sazhin and471\nHayakawa, 1992; Trakhtengerts, 1995, 1999; Nunn et al., 1997]. An example of source472\ndynamics can be seen in Figure 6, e.g., columns 1 and 2, where the chorus wave power473\nis seen to be relatively weak on the dayside at |\u03bbm| < 10\u25e6, and increases with latitude,474\nreaching a maximum at |\u03bbm| > 20\u25e6. This distribution of wave power has led some au-475\nthors to suggest that the chorus generation region could be located at high latitudes on476\nthe dayside [Tsurutani and Smith, 1977] but recent studies of Poynting flux show that477\neven though wave power maximises at high latitudes on the dayside, the propagation478\ndirection is uniformly away from the equator at all MLT [LeDocq et al., 1998; Lauben et479\nal., 2002; Santolik et al., 2004, 2005]. A possible interpretation of this behavior based480\non quasilinear theory, is that the cyclotron growth rates responsible for the generation of481\nchorus become progressively lower with increasing MLT, due to the scattering (loss) and482\nisotropization of the source population of electrons E \u223c 10 \u2212 100 keV. To reach a given483\namplitude (in order to reach the nonlinear threshold), the chorus waves need to propagate484\nfor a longer distance due to the lower cyclotron growth rate, which is made possible by485\nthe concomitant decrease in the Landau fluxes and resultant increase in \u03bbf (Figure 4), as486\nwell as decreased field-line inhomogeneity on the dayside [Tsyganenko and Sitnov, 2005]487\nallowing more uniform wave propagation. The above interpretation is consistent with488\nthe fact that it is predominantly the lower frequencies which show the extended growth489\nregion. Since lower frequency waves resonate with higher energy electrons, which are far490\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 24 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nless numerous than lower energy electrons, it is the lower frequencies which will have the491\nlowest growth rates and hence require the largest propagation distance to achieve signif-492\nicant total amplification. Wave power density increase is also enhanced due to magnetic493\nfield line convergence at high latitudes.494\n6. Conclusions\nIn the present paper, statistical distributions of suprathermal electrons (E = 0.213\u221216.5495\nkeV) from the CRRES satellite were used to fit analytical phase space density distributions496\nof the form f(v) = AN\/v\nn, as a function of L-shell, MLT, and geomagnetic activity. These497\nfitted distributions were then used in conjunction with ray tracing to calculate the Landau498\ndamping rates of an ensemble of rays representing chorus waves. The modeled propagation499\ncharacteristics were compared to statistical observations of chorus wave power, also from500\nthe CRRES satellite, in various frequency bands (f\/fce = 0.1\u22120.2, 0.2\u22120.3, ..., 0.6\u22120.7),501\nlatitude ranges (|\u03bbm| < 10\u25e6, 10\u25e6 < |\u03bbm| < 20\u25e6, and |\u03bbm| < 20\u25e6 ), and under a variety of502\ngeomagnetic conditions (AE < 100 nT, 100 < AE < 300 nT, and AE > 300 nT).503\nBased on the work presented in this paper, a number of conclusions can be drawn:504\n1. At all wave frequencies and geomagnetic activity conditions, chorus rays were Landau505\ndamped before they were able to magnetospherically reflect, consistent with the observed506\nunidirectional propagation observed generally away from the equator.507\n2. Chorus rays propagated to larger latitudes at lower L-shells (but outside the plasma-508\npause) than at larger L-shells, due to the lower ratio of Nh\/N0 (number of \u2018hot\u2019 electrons509\nrelative to the cold background electron number density).510\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nBORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS X - 25\n3. Lower frequency rays were found to propagate to higher latitudes than higher fre-511\nquency rays, consistent with CRRES observations. In addition, there was good agreement512\nbetween the absolute value of the final latitudes predicted by our model and the inferred513\nfinal latitude from the CRRES observations.514\n4. The MLT distribution of chorus wave power was found to be relatively uniform or515\nunstructured during geomagnetically quiet conditions, but showed a pronounced asymme-516\ntry during active conditions, with small propagation latitudes on the nightside, and large517\npropagation latitudes on the dayside. This asymmetry was well reflected in the CRRES518\nobservations.519\n5. The MLT distributions of chorus wave power under active conditions were found to520\nbe strongly controlled by the underlying distribution of suprathermal electrons, which were521\nmost intense on the nightside resulting in the most severe damping, and gradually decayed522\ntowards the dayside where large propagation lengths were observed. This depletion of523\nsuprathermal particles was interpreted on the basis of the loss timescales being faster524\nthan drift timescales, with the higher energy particles being affected more than the lower525\nenergy electrons.526\nIt was shown that many characteristics of the chorus wave-power distribution in L,527\nMLT, and latitude, were explained very well on the basis of Landau damping by the528\nsuprathermal particle population. This important population of particles may thus be529\nindirectly responsible for controlling the dynamics of the relativistic radiation-belt elec-530\ntrons, since many of the theories of chorus acceleration and loss rely on the interaction531\nbetween chorus waves and energetic particles at mid- and high- latitudes [Horne et al.,532\n2005b; Thorne et al., 2005a,b].533\nD R A F T May 17, 2007, 3:59pm D R A F T\nX - 26 BORTNIK ET AL.: PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF CHORUS\nIt was also shown that certain features appear in the chorus wave distribution on the534\ndayside, which are almost certainly related to the dynamics of the energetic electrons535\nE \u223c 10 \u2212 100 keV responsible for the generation of the chorus waves. Although we536\nhave proposed a preliminary reason for this behavior, it remains to be treated in a more537\nquantitative way in future studies.538\nAcknowledgments.
