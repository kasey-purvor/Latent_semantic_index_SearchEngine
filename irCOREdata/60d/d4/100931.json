In almost all cases, a large part of this\ncross section leads to excited states of the projectile residue.\nFor this reason inclusive cross-section measurements are of\nvery limited value. The measurement of coincidences between\nthe reaction residue and its decay \u03b3 rays makes it possible\nto obtain partial cross sections. These serve two purposes:\n(i) Their absolute values allow spectroscopic factors to be\ndeduced, and (ii) their differential cross sections, as a function\nof the residue parallel momentum, provide angular-momentum\nassignments, irrespective of their absolute normalization [1,2].\nBoth purposes are analogous to the use of low-energy transfer\nreactions for single-nucleon spectroscopy.\nIt has recently become evident that single-nucleon removal\ncan provide information on absolute spectroscopic factors\nthat test the extent to which the quasiparticles of effective-\ninteraction theories correspond to physical reality. The recent\nwork of Gade et al. [3] and the earlier papers cited therein\nagree with the results from (e, e\u2032p) reactions on stable nuclei,\nwhile also extending the spectroscopic possibilities to neutron\nremoval and to unstable nuclei.\nIn this Rapid Communication we present the first instance\nof an \u0002 = 3 neutron-knockout cross section observed using an\n46Ar beam.

Fortunately, the level scheme has\nbeen studied in fragmentation and \u03b2 decay [4,5]. We will show\nthat, although the contribution from excited states is of order\n50% of the inclusive cross section, it is nevertheless possible\nto obtain the desired information on the ground-state partial\ncross section.\nThe 46Ar secondary beam was obtained by fragmentation\nof a 110 MeV\/nucleon 48Ca primary beam provided by the\nCoupled Cyclotron Facility at the National Superconducting\nCyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University.\nThe primary fragmentation target (1034 mg\/cm2 9Be) was\nlocated at the mid-acceptance target position of the large-\nacceptance A1900 fragment separator [6].\nA secondary 9Be target of 188(4) mg\/cm2 was placed\nat the target position of the high-resolution S800 magnetic\nspectrograph [7] and surrounded by the SeGA (segmented\ngermanium array) \u03b3 array, configured with fifteen 32-fold\nsegmented HPGe detectors [8]. These were arranged in two\nrings at a distance of 24 cm from the knockout target (to the\ncenter of the crystal) with central angles of 90\u25e6 and 37\u25e6 relative\nto the beam axis. The high degree of segmentation allowed\nfor an accurate event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the\n\u03b3 rays emitted by the reaction residues in flight. Details of the\nsetup have been discussed elsewhere [9,10].\nThe average midtarget beam energy was 70 MeV\/nucleon.\nThe particle identification and the reconstruction of the\nmomentum distribution of the 45Ar residues was performed\nwith the focal-plane detector system of the S800 spectrograph\n[7,11].

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 051301(R) (2005)\nFIG. 1. Coincident \u03b3 rays referred to the rest system of the 45Ar\nresidues. Only peak structures that are clearly visible in the Doppler-\nreconstructed spectra of both rings of SeGA are attributed to the decay\nscheme of the knockout residue 45Ar.\nthe time of flight (taken between scintillators), and the position\nand angles of the reaction products in the focal plane of the\nspectrograph were employed for event-by-event identification\nof the reaction residues.\nThe inclusive cross section \u03c3inc for one-neutron knockout\nto all bound 45Ar final states was obtained from the yield\nof detected fragments relative to the number of incoming\nprojectiles and the number density of the 9Be secondary\ntarget. This analysis was performed repeatedly during the\nexperiment to guard against fluctuations in the intensity of the\nincident beam. The main uncertainties stem from the choice\nof the software gates used for particle identification (7%),\nthe correction for the momentum and angle acceptance of the\nS800 spectrograph (5%), and the stability of the beam (5%).\nThese systematic errors are assumed to be independent and\nhave been added in quadrature. The resulting inclusive cross\nsection is \u03c3inc = 122(13) mb.\nTen \u03b3 -ray transitions, observed in coincidence with the\n45Ar knockout residues, are shown in Fig. 1. The \u03b3 -ray\ndetection efficiencies were determined from measurements\nwith calibrated sources and from simulations that included\nthe effect of the conversion of the observed \u03b3 response to a\n\u03b3 energy referred to the center-of-mass system. The effi-\nciencies are estimated to be accurate to 5%. Although an\nanisotropic \u03b3 angular distribution is possible, from alignment\neffects in the knockout reaction, this is neglected in the\nevaluation of the \u03b3 intensities as the detector angles are very\nclose to the crossover points in the angular distributions and\nrepresent the average intensity (see, e.g., the example shown\nin Fig. 12 of Ref. [1]). The 532-keV line presents a special\nchallenge because of its reported [4] half-life of 0.34+0.32\u22120.15 ns.\nThe corresponding mean flight path of several centimeters\nfor the recoils affects the Doppler reconstruction (note the\nmoderate asymmetry visible in Fig. 1) and, more importantly,\nincreases the detection efficiency for the forward part of the\narray. We have therefore based our intensity for this \u03b3 -ray\ntransition on the data taken at 90\u25e6, where the correction is\nsmall and where the large uncertainty in the half-life is of little\nimportance.\nThe resulting energies and absolute intensities per 45Ar\nfragment are 532(9) keV 32.0(40)%, 804(9) keV 4.8(9)%,\n870(9) keV 2.8(6)%, 1067(11) keV 3.5(9)%, 1195(13) keV\n9.1(13)%, 1228(13) keV 9.5(14)%, 1346(12) keV 4.4(9)%,\n1403(14) keV \u0001 1.2%, 1908(6) keV 5.7(12)%, and\n2165(18) keV 3.4(7)%. In the following we cite, for consis-\ntency, the energies measured in this work. More precise values\ncan be found in the \u03b2 decay of Ref. [5], where the \u03b3 -ray\nemission takes place at rest and therefore is not modified by\nthe Doppler shift experienced in in-beam experiments. We\ninterpret the intense 532-keV \u03b3 ray as depopulating the first\nexcited 32\n\u2212\nstate of 45Ar. We do not have detailed information\nallowing a discussion of the placement of the \u03b3 rays of higher\nenergy but draw on previous studies of 45Ar from projectile\nfragmentation [4] and \u03b2 decay [5]. Coincidence information,\nsupported in our experiment, shows that the group of \u03b3 rays\nfrom 804(9) to 1228(13) keV feeds the first excited state,\nwhereas the group of \u03b3 rays from 1346(12) to 2165(18) keV\nmost likely decays to the ground state. An intensity balance\nbased on this gives a branch of 47(5)% or 57(8) mb to levels\nabove 1400 keV and a 3(3)% direct branch to the excited level\nat 532 keV. The branch to the 45Ar ground state is 50(5)%,\ncorresponding to a knockout cross section of 61(9) mb. The\nresults for the two lowest levels are given in Table I.\nThe consistency of the analysis is supported by the very\ndifferent shapes emerging for the momentum distributions\nshown in Figs. 2 and 3. They have been corrected for the\nacceptance of the S800 spectrograph. Data points with this\ncorrection exceeding a factor of 1.5 are excluded from the\nfigures. In the analysis, the two position-sensitive cathode\nreadout drift chambers (CRDCs) of the S800 focal-plane\ndetector system and the magnetic settings of the spectrograph,\nin conjunction with the optics code COSY [12], permit a\nreconstruction of the longitudinal momentum of the residues\non an event-by-event basis. The inclusive longitudinal mo-\nmentum distribution is a superposition of the ground-state and\nexcited-state contributions. The magnetic spectrograph was\noperated in the mode in which the beam is focused at the\nposition of the reaction target in front of the S800 spectrograph.\nTABLE I.

(b) Inclusive momentum\ndistribution (black dots), shown on the same relative scale as the non\ncoincident events in Fig. 3. The errors are smaller than the size of the\npoints.\nThis offers a larger momentum bite, but at the cost of an\ninferior resolution to that using the \u201cdispersion matched\u201d\noptics setting. The momentum profile of the incoming 46Ar\nbeam provided the experimental resolution function shown in\nFig. 3. The dashed line is a fit obtained by folding a square pulse\nwith a Gaussian, thereby modeling the momentum bite of the\nspectrograph. The theoretical momentum distributions [19]\nwere transformed to the laboratory frame and subsequently\nfolded with the resolution function. Note that because of this\ncorrection, the \u0002 = 0, 1 shapes in Fig. 2(a) are very similar;\nthe effect on the wide \u0002 = 3 distribution in Fig. 3(b) is small.\nThe momentum distribution in coincidence with the\n532-keV \u03b3 ray is shown in Fig. 2. That in coincidence with\nthe 1.2-MeV \u03b3 rays was identical and is not shown. These\ndistributions must represent a superposition of components\nwith different \u0002 values. The calculation discussed in the fol-\nlowing does not permit a precise theoretical fit to the shape, but\nthe result is consistent with approximately equal contributions\nof \u0002 = 0, 1 and \u0002 = 2, 3. The momentum distribution of the\ncross section to the ground state of 45Ar, shown in Fig. 3,\nwas obtained by scaling the distribution in coincidence with\nthe 0.532-MeV \u03b3 ray to 50% and subtracting it from the\ninclusive momentum spectrum.

The single-particle (unit) cross section\n\u03c3sp is based on a normalized single-nucleon wave function\nand hence a spectroscopic factor of unity [13,14]. It is the sum\nof contributions from stripping and diffraction dissociation\ndetailed in Table I. Finally, the reduction factor Rs relative to\nthe shell model takes into account couplings that go beyond the\neffective-interaction model space used for calculating C2Sj .\nFor completeness we note that, for the ground-state cross\nsection, the quantity Rs takes a value of 0.85(12), a result\nthat we shall not discuss further.\nAs in previous work, the shell-model spectroscopic factors\nwere calculated in a configuration-mixed model (see Brown\n[15]). The active space had the protons in the sd shell and\nthe neutrons in the fp shell, with the interaction of Nummela\net al. [16]. The assignments and spectroscopic factors for the\nlowest two states are given in Table I. The calculated energy\nof the 32\n\u2212\nstate was 0.49 MeV, in good agreement with that\nmeasured. The shell model calculation gave two additional\n7\n2\n\u2212\nstates at 2.40 and 2.70 MeV with spectroscopic factors of\n0.26 and 0.99, respectively. Other negative-parity states were\ncalculated to have spectroscopic factors smaller than 0.1. The\nnegative-parity levels have not been identified experimentally\nand they would account for only a fraction of the cross section\n051301-3\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nA. GADE el al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 051301(R) (2005)\nto levels above 0.532 MeV. The main part of this cross section\nis almost certainly from fragmented positive-parity states from\nthe sd neutron shell, not included in our model space. We note\nthat the spectroscopic factor of 0.2(2) for the p3\/2 orbit is small\nand provides no indication for a breakdown of theN = 28 shell\nclosure for 46Ar.\nFor the calculation of the single-particle knockout partial\ncross sections there are several parameters, related to nuclear\nsize, that have to be specified. In our most recent work [3]\nwe have used self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations\nbased on the Skyrme-X parameter set [17]. These have\nbeen very successful in describing observables that reflect\nnuclear size (see [18]). The nucleon-45Ar relative motion wave\nfunction was calculated in a Woods-Saxon potential with the\nseparation energy adjusted to the experimental value and with\nthe rms radius of the orbital also taken from the HF calculation\n(with the appropriate center-of-mass correction [3]). For the\n0f7\/2 state these values are 8.02(4) MeV and 4.036 fm,\nrespectively. The residue-target S matrix was constructed from\nthe proton and neutron HF matter distributions for 45Ar, as\ndescribed in [3]. These lead to the values given in Table I. If\nwe use instead just the HF matter radius, of 3.449 fm, and\nthen assume Fermi-form matter distributions with diffuseness\nparameters of 0.5 or 0.6 fm, we obtain values 3% and 9%\nlower, respectively. These correspond to a theoretical error\ncomparable to the experimental error.\nThe theoretical momentum distributions were calculated\nwith a new method [19] that uses the same S matrices as\nwere used for calculating the single-particle cross sections.\nUnlike the black-disk method used previously, the new method\ncan also calculate the transverse momentum distribution. The\ndistributions in coincidence with \u03b3 rays are presumably a\nmixture of components with \u0002= 0\u20133, but the spectra lack\nthe precision to enable a decomposition. The distribution to\nthe ground state (Fig. 3) is in overall agreement with the\ncalculation for \u0002 = 3, as expected for this state. It represents\nthe first example of a distribution with angular momentum\ngreater than 2.\nThe distribution for the 0f7\/2 state in Fig. 3 shows an\nasymmetry with a \u201ctail\u201d toward lower momenta. A similar\nthough less marked effect is present in Fig. 2 and has also\nbeen seen for \u0002 = 0 and 2 cross sections for the nuclei\n34Si [20] and 34Ar [10]. Such an asymmetry implies effects\nthat go beyond the eikonal approximation. The \u201ctransfer-to-\nthe-continuum\u201d model [21], which treats the residue-target\ncollision semiclasically but the neutron transition amplitude\nquantum mechanically, leads in a natural way to asymmetric\ndistributions. It accounts for some of the features in 34Si,\nbut it does not reproduce the tails seen there nor the more\npronounced ones in the present work.\nThe asymmetry is reminiscent of the broadened and\nasymmetric parallel-momentum profile found for the halo\nnuclei 11Be and 15C, which could be understood by using a\nproper dynamical treatment of continuum-coupling effects in\nthe diffractive channel [22]. However, the same explanation\nis unlikely to apply to this 0f7\/2 state, which is strongly\nbound and for which diffractive breakup contributes only of\norder 25% of the cross section (see Table I). Instead, we\nrequire a modification to the stripping cross section. In the\ncalculations of Bertulani and Hansen [19] it emerged that in\nreactions of deeply bound states, the residue scatters elastically\non the target simultaneously with the stripping. The elastic\nprocess transfers momentum from the residue to the target\nand so energy conservation will give rise to a low-energy tail.\nEstimates for a beryllium target, however, show that for the\nscattering angles of relevance, this effect is much too small\nto produce the momentum losses (of up to 500 MeV\/c) seen\nin Fig. 3. Multiple elastic collisions of the residue with the\nneutron and \u03b1 particles produced by the impact of the stripped\nneutron with the target might lead to additional, dissipative\nmomentum shifts, but for the moment this speculation is not\nsupported by quantitative estimates.\nWe have further examined whether a deviation from eikonal\ntheory is also visible in the angular distribution of the residues,\nas was the case for the diffractive breakup of 15C [22]. The\npresent experiment did not track the trajectory of the incoming\n46Ar projectile and therefore the angular resolution was limited\nto 0.5\u25e6 full width at half maximum. As a semi-quantitative\nmeasure of the angular spread, we calculated the fraction\nof events falling inside 1.1\u25e6 for each parallel-momentum\nsetting (see Fig. 3). These fractions are considerably below\nthe theoretical values calculated from the two-dimensional\ndistribution [19] and, moreover, the deviation is greatest for the\nevents away from the peak corresponding to larger momentum\ntransfers. This lends qualitative support to the need for a\ndissipative mechanism acting in the final state of the reaction\nproducts.\nOne may wonder whether the observed deviations of\nthe differential cross sections from eikonal theory could be\na harbinger of a problem that would seriously affect the\ncalculation of the total single-particle cross sections. We do\nnot believe that this is the case as the two calculations are on\nquite different footings (see the original paper by Hencken,\nBertsch, and Esbensen [23] on which [19] is based). In the\neikonal treatment, the integrated partial cross sections are\nexpressed by matrix elements with the structure of a sum\nrule and that involve only the overlap wave function of the\ntransition. It expresses the joint probability that the nucleon\nis absorbed and that the residue undergoes, at most, elastic\nscattering. The expression, through completeness, is inclusive\nwith respect to all final states. The analogous expression [23]\nfor the differential cross section, in contrast, approximates\nthe final states of the residue by plane waves, and hence\ntheir momentum distribution by a Fourier-like transform\nof the overlap function, modified by the absorptive terms.\nThe calculation is therefore approximate in its description\nof the final states of the residue, target, and the absorbed\nnucleon.\nWe have presented the first case of a measured parallel-\nmomentum distribution for \u0002 = 3 nucleon knockout. The\ndeduced absolute spectroscopic factor, of 4.9(7), agrees with\nshell-model calculations for this nucleus with a valence\nshell dominated by the \u03bd0f7\/2 state, and the low cross\nsection to \u03bd1p3\/2 state confirms that the N = 28 shell gap\nis well preserved, thus making 46Ar a good semimagic\nnucleus. The parallel- and transverse-momentum distribu-\ntions for this transition show interesting deviations from\neikonal reaction theory, which are suggestive of missing\n051301-4\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nKNOCKOUT FROM 46Ar: \u0002 = 3 NEUTRON REMOVAL . . .
