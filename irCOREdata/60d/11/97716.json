Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, UK. \n \n  \nPreface \n \nGlobal mean sea-level rise has increased from a rate of a few centimetres per century \nover the past few millennia to a few decimetres per century in the past few decades. This \nten fold increase in rate is due to climate change and is dominated by melting of land ice \nand warming of ocean water. The current warming trend is expected to continue and so \nglobal mean sea level will continue to rise. In this article, we review recent advances in \nour understanding of past sea-level changes on decadal to millennial timescales to \nconsider how well future changes can be constrained. The majority of studies suggest that \nglobal mean sea-level rise will most likely be less than 1 m over the 21st century. \nImportantly, there will be significant departures from the global mean by several \ndecimetres in many areas. As a consequence, future research should be targeted at better \nconstraining the spatial variability in future changes so that high-risk areas can be \nidentified.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nWith about 200 million people living within coastal floodplains and 2 million km2 of land \nand $1 trillion worth of assets lying less than 1 m above current sea level, sea-level rise is \none of the major socio-economic hazards associated with global warming1. The expected \nrate is, however, extremely uncertain. While the latest IPCC report2 suggests a range of \n0.18-0.59 m of sea-level rise between 1980-1999 and 2090-2099, it emphasises that the \ncontribution from ice dynamic changes is highly uncertain and provides three \n\u201cillustrative\u201d scenarios suggesting a possible addition of up to 0.17 m from this source.  \nSince then, several studies3,4 have suggested that a rise larger than 1 m cannot be ruled \nout. Sea-level rates of this magnitude (m per century) are not uncommon in \nreconstructions of past sea-level change using geological evidence and it has recently \nbeen suggested that similar rates occurred during the previous interglacial warm period \n120,000 years ago5,6 when the volume of land ice was similar to that at present.  \n \nA \u201cheadline\u201d figure of 1 m during the 21st century represents only the global average sea-\nlevel rise. Many different physical processes contribute to sea-level change (see Box 1) \nand none of these produce a spatially uniform signal. Indeed, one of the few statements \nthat can be made with certainty is that future sea-level change will not be the same \neverywhere. Thus, the development of regional and local estimates of future sea-level rise \n\u2013 required for effective risk assessment \u2013 is one of the primary challenges for the coming \nyears2. Prediction relies on models, and the veracity of model output is based on \nverification against historical and geological data.. However, interpretation of these data \nrequires great care in light of the large spatial and temporal variability in sea-level \nchange. In this article we summarise recent progress in understanding the variability in a \nsuite of sea-level related observations at timescales ranging from decades to millennia. \nWe conclude with an estimate of our current ability to predict future sea-level rise and \nhighlight outstanding problems to address in the coming years in order to achieve greater \naccuracy and confidence in such predictions.  \nThe Satellite Era \n \nThe most comprehensive sea-level observations are the most recent. Since 1992, precise \nsatellite altimeter missions have provided near-global maps of absolute sea level (Box 1) \nevery 10 days, permitting the sea-level trend to be determined for the majority of the \nocean area (Figure 1).The measurements highlight the non-uniform nature of the change \nover more than 14 years. Although the average is around 3 mm\/yr, there are regions \nexhibiting trends of over 10 mm\/yr and larger areas (notably the north-eastern Pacific) \nwhere sea level has fallen over this period. The small spatial scales of some of these \ndifferences also draw attention to the issue of spatial sampling. \n \nRecently, two observing systems that complemented the altimetric data have been put \ninto operation.  The first, the Argo network, is a series of autonomous floats that sink and \nascend, monitoring temperature and salinity in the top 1-2 km of the ocean. Since 2000, \nthe Argo network has increased to more than 3000 floats. The second, the Gravity \nRecovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission, launched in 2002, \nmeasures the global gravity field every month. Resulting maps can be used to monitor \nmonth to month gravity changes which are dominated by the motion of water around the \nEarth. Together, the Argo and GRACE measurement systems can, in principle, separate \nout the contributions to sea-level change from changes in ocean water density and \nchanges in ocean mass. In the case of GRACE, it is also possible to determine the transfer \nof land-based water to the ocean. \n \nInitial comparison of all three data sets7 highlighted an inconsistency due to apparent \nocean cooling8. This has since been identified as a result of differing biases in \ninstruments observing ocean temperature9-12, while geodetic constraints from \nobservations of the Earth\u2019s dynamic oblateness, confirmed that this apparent cooling was \nnot being offset by a large increase in melting land ice13. After applying corrections for \nthese biases, several studies14-16 have shown greatly improved consistency, in one case14 \nfinding a tightly-closed sea-level budget for interannual and seasonal cycles, but a \nsignificant imbalance of over 3 mm\/yr in the trend. In the second case15, a smaller net \nimbalance of about 1 mm\/yr was found (this is within the estimated error bars). In the \nthird study16 GRACE data were used in two different ways, in one case using a larger \ngeodetic correction over the oceans than in other studies, and in the other using it only to \nestimate Antarctic and Greenland mass loss, and combining with other datasets to \nestimate the total mass entering the ocean. These two methods both result in a balance to \nwithin a small fraction of one mm\/yr.  However, between these three studies, there are \ndifferences of about 1 mm\/yr among each of the three sea-level components (altimetry, \nsteric and mass), suggesting that this is the true error bound on trend estimates for these \nshort (4-year) time series. Differences may be partly a result of slightly different time \nspans chosen and the dominant role of interannual variability over periods of only a few \nyears, but there are also issues with each of the observing systems. \n \nProblems with calibration of the temperature measurements were noted above, but a \nsignificant part of the imbalance arises from the incomplete temperature sampling of the \nocean, particularly the Southern Ocean14, which may be insufficient prior to 200416. The \ndevelopment of innovative ways to reduce sampling bias17 is important. The GRACE \nmass estimates suffer from a number of complications that contribute to their uncertainty. \nBecause of the small signal over the oceans, compared to those over land, the analysis \nmust reduce both the sampling of the nearby land signal along the coasts18 and the \npresence of correlated errors in the GRACE solutions19,20.  In addition, the GRACE \nmission is insensitive to geocenter motion, i.e. the motion of the Earth\u2019s centre of figure \nrelative to the center of mass of the whole Earth (including cryosphere, hydrosphere and \natmosphere). Ignoring this contribution can introduce an underestimate of up to 30% in \nsea-level rise caused by Greenland melting18. Estimates of geocenter motion derived from \nGRACE products or satellite laser ranging can be used in these analyses, but the accuracy \nof the trend in these estimates is difficult to obtain21. Finally, the ongoing contribution of \nvertical land motion from glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA; the isostatic response of the \nsolid Earth to past mass exchange between land ice and oceans) to gravity changes over \nthe oceans is particularly large, with values ranging from -1 to -2 mm\/yr (water-\nequivalent mass change) utilised in recent analyses7,14,15. \n \nAltimetry is not a perfect measurement system either. Although comparison with tide \ngauges shows that an accuracy of 0.4 mm\/yr should be attainable22,23, two of the above \nanalyses14,15 give estimates of 3.6 and 2.4 mm\/yr respectively (both corrected for GIA in \nthe same way). Much of this difference appears to result from the fact that the two four-\nyear periods of analysis are offset by 6 months, but it should not be forgotten that there is \na continual need to check for errors in the various corrections which need to be applied to \naltimeter data. It is also worth noting that two different tide-gauge based reconstructions \nof global sea level24,25 produce curves (presented in ref. 24) which depart from the \naltimeter-based record after 1999, although this may reflect the limitations of the tide-\ngauge network rather than the altimetry. \n \n \nSince the most recent IPCC report, there have been two main advances: 1)  correction of \nthe biases in ocean temperature observations9,11, which greatly reduces the apparent \ncooling seen over the last few years10,12 as well as reducing the apparent interdecadal \nvariability in steric sea level24; and 2) the ability to use three observing systems \n(altimetry, GRACE, and Argo) to check the degree of closure of the mass flux and steric \nbudget. However, given the short (4 years) and differing time periods for the calculation \nof trends, it is not surprising that the individual contribution estimates vary between \ndifferent studies, with central estimates of 0.8 to 2.2 mm\/yr for mass flux15,16, -0.5 to 0.8 \nmm\/yr for steric14,15 and 2.4-3.6 mm\/yr from altimetry14,15. \n \nFor all these uncertainties, progress is rapid and it is becoming clear that the combination \nof observing systems is very powerful. But the greatest dividends will come with longer \ntime series as interannual variability becomes less dominant and it becomes possible to \nisolate the causes of decadal and regional variability. \n \nThe 20th Century \n \nThe large spatial variability in sea-level change as well as honest assessment of error \nsources must also be considered carefully when interpreting older measurements. These \nnecessarily rely on a highly incomplete observing system: the global tide gauge \nnetwork25. From these records (Fig. 2) it is clear that spatial variation is still an important \ncontributor to the measured changes even at the century time scale. Various processes \n(atmosphere-driven and internal ocean dynamical modes, unmodelled vertical land \nmovement) probably contribute to this variability. In some cases, these processes are \nlikely to produce very localized signals, bringing into question how representative the \ntide-gauge record is of ocean basin scale averages. More work is needed to resolve the \nroles of these various processes. \n  \nFor the globally-integrated budget, the new temperature calibrations cited above improve \nthe balance for the period 1961-2003 (ref. 24), but complete closure contains many \nuncertainties, including the human influence on land-water storage26, and relies on a \nsignificant (0.2 mm\/yr) unmeasured deep ocean temperature component24. It may never \nbe possible to determine the steric contribution to 20th century sea-level change to the \nsame accuracy as can be achieved with the measurement system now in place but it \nremains important to understand better the magnitudes and error budgets of the various \nprocesses that contributed to sea-level change during this period.  \n \nFew direct observations of ice mass flux into the oceans exist for the pre-satellite area. \nOne indirect method of estimating the polar mass contributions is to use regional \nvariations in the sea-level response to ice mass change  (\u201cfingerprinting\u201d; see Box 1). \nInitial applications of this method inferred a sea-level trend from Greenland water flux of \n0.35 to 0.6 mm\/yr27,28. Unfortunately,  steric and dynamical ocean-level changes are \nsignificantly larger than the ice-induced signal in most areas29 and so should be removed \nusing a combination of ocean models and available data. Such a combination is available \nfor the satellite altimeter period30, but for earlier periods this procedure is more \nspeculative.  While the improved ocean temperature time series produces less decadal \nvariability in sea level due to the thermosteric process11,24, thus reducing the discrepancy \nbetween observations and climate models31,32, there still remain significant unexplained \nsignals in total sea-level variability. There is a need to assess how much of the dynamical \nsignal can be explained by realistically-forced ocean models, beyond the regional \nanalysis of simplified models33,34, and to consider the dynamical as well as the \ngravitational and isostatic response to melting ice35. \n \nAn influential paper by Munk36 reviewed the status of closure in the sea-level budget for \nthe 20th century and reached a number of conclusions. One of these, based on \nobservations and model predictions of changes in Earth rotation, limited the melt \ncontribution from the two ice sheets. The lack of closure led Munk to coin the term \u201csea-\nlevel enigma\u201d since there was no clear solution at that time. The identification of an error \nin the standard theory of polar motion of the Earth, together with a reassessment of the \nerror bounds on constraints placed by measurements going back to 1979, has shown that \ngeodetic constraints on ice melt over the pre-GRACE period are weaker than previously \nthought37. This result provides a solution to the \u201cenigma\u201d by broadening the uncertainty \non the contribution of ice melt to 20th century global mean sea-level rise.  \n \nVertical land motion can introduce highly localised signals to tide-gauge records (tide \ngauges measure motion of the sea surface relative to the land). One way to reduce the \nimpact of land motion on estimates of global mean sea-level rise in the 20th century is to \nmeasure directly the land signal component using the global positioning system (GPS) \nand remove it to isolate the climate-driven sea-surface variation. A recent application of \nthis method resulted in a decreased standard deviation of the corrected tide gauge rates by \n35% (ref 38). The reduced estimate of global mean sea-level rise (1.3 mm\/yr) offers \nanother solution to the \u201cenigma\u201d.  GPS rates of land motion are obtained from relatively \nshort times series (< 10 yr in general) and so this correction procedure might be less \napplicable in regions where the recent land motion might not represent that for the past \n50-100 years (e.g. those affected by frequent and large earthquakes, sediment \ncompaction, large-scale mining and land reclamation).  \n \nRates of sea-level change have varied both spatially and temporally during the 20th \ncentury (Fig. 2). Decadal rates of global sea-level rise show large variations throughout \nthe 20th century39. A number of recent analyses have studied sea-level accelerations and \nregional patterns of sea-level change29,40,41 and have shown that regional differences, at \nleast partly associated with ocean dynamical response to changes in atmospheric forcing, \npersist on multi-decadal timescales. Thus, in certain locations, dynamical processes may \nhave contributed significantly to the observed 20th century trend. The influence of these \ndynamical signals complicates the determination of a global mean acceleration from sea-\nlevel records of length > 100 years. For this application, supplementing the tide-gauge \ndata with sea-level data reconstructed from the geological record is highly beneficial. \nThere is strong evidence that global mean sea-level rise has accelerated from a rate of \ncentimetres per century in the past few millennia to decimetres per century in the 20th \ncentury42,43, but this acceleration does not appear to have been synchronous. High-\nresolution sea-level records from salt marshes in the North Atlantic44,45 and New \nZealand46 (Fig. 2c) date this acceleration between 1880 and 1920. However, instrumental \nrecords41 and other proxy records47 demonstrate a regional non-synchroneity of sea-level \naccelerations during the past two centuries. This non-synchroneity likely reflects the \nspatial variability of sea-level change due to the influence of land-ice changes, ocean-\ntemperature change and long-period ocean dynamics. \n \nThe past decade has seen the proposal and solution of an attribution problem in \nexplaining the observed global mean sea-level rise for the 20th century. At present, \nuncertainties in the observed global mean trend as well as in the magnitudes of various \ncontributing processes are large enough to account for any remaining imbalance. An \nimportant focus for future research is to understand better the observed temporal and \nspatial variability in sea-level change with respect to the underlying oceanographic and \nclimatic processes. \n \nThe Geological Record \n \nObservations of sea-level change during the past few 100s to 100,000s of years are \ndetermined through the use of palaeoecological or morphological information in the \ngeological record (see Table 1). Height and time precision of these records lie in the \nranges 10s m to decimetres and 1000s to a few years, respectively. Spatial sampling is, in \ngeneral, poor compared to the distribution of tide gauges and the majority of the data \nspan parts of the Holocene period only (10,000 yr to present), with a distinct paucity of \ndata prior to the last glacial maximum around 25,000 years ago. \n \nDuring the most recent glacial-interglacial transition (approx. 20-7,000 yr before present) \nthe rates and patterns of sea-level changes were dominated by the mass exchange \nbetween ice sheets and oceans and its influence on the solid Earth and gravity field48-50. \nWe note that, while there were large ocean temperature changes during the most recent \nglacial-interglacial transition51, the steric effect is likely to have been within data \nuncertainty in most regions (although this remains to be demonstrated). Fig. 3 shows a \nselection of data that illustrates some of the spatial and temporal variability of the sea-\nlevel response to the ice-ocean mass exchange. At sites distant from major glaciation \ncentres (a-c), sea-level change is dominated by the rate of global ice melt. The observed \nfall in sea level following the end of major melting (~7,000 yr before present; Frame b) is \ndue to isostatic processes52. A growing number of high resolution records (c) detect an \nacceleration in sea level around 1850-1900AD43-45. In regions once covered by large ice \nsheets (e.g. Fennoscandinavia, Canada) crustal uplift dominates the response leading to a \nmonotonic sea-level fall (d). This signal can become relatively complex in adjacent areas \n(e) due to the interplay between local isostatic and global meltwater signals.   \n \nSea levels in mid-to-low latitudes rose, on average, at a rate of ~1 m per century (Fig. \n3a), with this rate increasing to ~4 m per century during periods of exceptionally rapid \nmelting that lasted only a few centuries53,54 (Table 1). Of course, these rates must be \ninterpreted carefully when attempting to place a bound on possible rates of future rise as \nthey occurred when there was 70% more grounded ice on Earth, a significant portion of \nwhich was located on continental shelves and therefore inherently unstable. A recent \nstudy combining field evidence of ice margin retreat, palaeoclimate observations and \nmodelling has argued that mass loss from the Laurentide ice sheet dominated global \nmelting in the early Holocene and that the rates of low latitude sea-level rise measured \nduring this period (order 1 m per century) are plausible in the 21st century due to the \nresponse of the Greenland ice sheet to predicted warming55.  \n \nMore direct analogues for the response of the present ice sheets to future warming can be \nfound by considering past and present interglacial periods when ice extent was similar to \nthat at present. During the previous interglacial global mean sea level is estimated to have \nbeen  4 to >6 m higher than present in response to elevated temperatures sustained over a \nfew milennia56. Studies have indicated that significant volume reductions of both the \nGreenland57,58 and West Antarctic ice sheets59,60 were largely responsible and that rates of \nsea-level change during this period may have reached values exceeding 1 m per \ncentury6,60. During the early to mid-Holocene, the Greenland ice sheet was subjected to \ntemperatures about 2oC greater than present values61 (compared to ~5oC during the \nprevious interglacial58). The response of the ice sheet to this more modest forcing appears \nto have been a few decimetres of ice-equivalent sea-level change62,63 with rates of melt on \nthe order of a centimetre per century.  \n \nDuring the mid-to-late Holocene, subsequent to the complete disintegration of ice sheets \nin North America and Eurasia by around 7,000 yr before present, the magnitude and rates \nof ice melting have been relatively small. Sea-level records from mid-to-low latitude \nlocations (e.g. Fig. 3b), when corrected for isostatic effects, suggest about 3 m of ice \nequivalent sea-level change between approximately 7,000 and 3,000 yr before present. \nThere is some disagreement on the timing of the end of ice melting64,65, which most likely \nreflects differences in model parameterisation and data precision. The IPCC65 allows for \nup to 0.4 m of ice-equivalent sea-level rise since 2 ka, but considers it more likely that \nthis value has been zero (within data error bounds) from 2,000 yr until the acceleration to \nmodern rates. This is corroborated by archaeological data from the Mediterranean66.  \n \nMuch of the melt in the mid-to-late Holocene has been attributed to the Antarctic ice \nsheet67. This scenario is supported by evidence for contributions of only a few decimetres \nfrom the Greenland ice sheet68-71 and small glaciers56 during this period and is also \nconsistent with a growing body of data from Antarctica. Das and Alley72 documented a \nchange towards a more maritime climate in West Antarctica in the late Holocene which \nled to considerable ice retreat in Marie Byrd Land73 and the Amundsen Sea embayment74. \nUsing an ice load model of the Antarctic ice sheet constrained by field evidence of past \nice extent and contemporary mass balance measurements, Ivins and James75 estimated \nthat the ice sheet contributed ~4 m to global mean sea-level rise since ~7,000 yr, with the \nmajority of this delivered by ~3,000 yr ago. \n \nSea-level observations for the mid-to-late Holocene provide constraints on the natural \nvariability of sea-level change immediately preceding the industrial revolution. These \ndata indicate that local rates were generally at the 1-10 cm per century level (see Table \n1). For example, high-resolution records based on salt-marsh stratigraphy76 and \nmicroatolls77 show that regional short-term fluctuations did not exceed 0.2 m per century \nduring the middle and late Holocene, including the Medieval Climatic Optimum78,79. (We \nnote that these rates are an order of magnitude lower than rates of ice-equivalent sea-level \nchange inferred for some previous interglacial periods using oxygen isotope records5,6.) \nIn most studies, the observations have been interpreted in terms of vertical land motion \nand\/or land ice contributions to sea-level change. However, the contributions from steric \nchanges and long-period ocean dynamics may be significant in some areas. For example, \nduring the past 8,000 yr, sea-surface temperatures determined from proxy records \nindicate changes of magnitude several oC \u2013 with some regions experiencing a distinct \nwarming and others a cooling80.  \n \nReconstructions of past sea-level changes demonstrate that the sea-level response to \nchanges in ice sheets has a high degree of spatial and temporal variability over century to \nmillennial time scales.  Rates of rise on the order of metres per century sustained over \nseveral centuries have occurred in the past during major deglaciation events. Whether \nsuch rates can be achieved with the current configuration of ice sheets, as suggested by \noxygen-isotope data from the last interglacial6, remains an important question for future \nresearch.  \n \n \nTowards Improved Predictions of Future Sea-Level Change \n \nA tightly constrained prediction of sea-level change in the coming decades to millennia \nrequires knowledge of the climate forcing and an ability to calculate accurately the sea-\nlevel response to this forcing. The uncertainties in both of these elements are reflected in \nthe spread of global mean sea-level projections offered in the most recent IPCC report2: \n0.18-0.59 cm between 1980-1999 and 2090-2099. \n \nAlthough 70-75% of the IPCC projected rise is due to ocean temperature change, the \ninfluence of ice dynamical changes is identified as a major source of uncertainty. On-\ngoing and future efforts to understand better the processes that control ice discharge in \nthe large ice sheets and marine terminating glaciers will play a central role in constraining \nbetter the land ice contribution to sea level over the 21st century. Sea-level changes \nreconstructed from the geological record can provide useful constraints on upper limits of \nice melt, particularly when combined with additional observational and modelling \nconstraints to isolate the climatic conditions and ice sheet(s) responsible for a given rate \nof rise55,81. Sea-level and climate records for previous interglacial periods are of \nparticular interest given the analogous ice extent and elevated temperatures compared to \npresent (although forcing factors, such as insolation and CO2, may differ). The high rates \nof sea level change interpreted from oxygen isotope records5,6 are certainly troubling and \nwarrant further investigation, particularly through the use of more precise proxy methods.  \n \nIf spatial variability in sea level were to be included in sea-level projections for the 21st \ncentury, the spread in possible values, which would be defined for a specific region or \nlocality, would likely be significantly different than that for the global mean. For \nexample, a recent study concluded on a sea-level rise of 30-80 cm by 2100 in North West \nEurope82. It is possible that in specific areas, the upper bound could be significantly \nhigher due to, for example: land subsidence83, ocean dynamics84, and gravitational and \nrotational changes due to ice melting85. Even though producing regional projections of \nsea-level change is considerably more challenging, it must be a focus of future research \ngiven the large spatial variability in past changes. \n \nIt has become clear from satellite altimetry that steric and dynamic changes have \ndominated spatial variability in the past few decades and so will most likely continue to \ndo so in the 21st century. While future projections of this component are converging, \nthere remains significant discrepancy at the regional scale2. It is critical to maintain the \ncurrent level of observational control (both satellite and in-situ systems) in order to test \nand calibrate the models over decadal and longer periods. In addition, devising more \nsophisticated combinations of geodetic and oceanographic data, as well as correctly \naccounting for temperature sampling errors will result in more rigorous testing of current \nmodels. \n \nAdvances in our understanding of the causes of past and present sea-level change have \nbeen remarkable in the past decade and this progress continues unabated86,87. The rich \nobservational data base made available through satellite monitoring has played a central \nrole in the rate of progress. Our understanding of the causes of sea-level changes in the \nlate 1900s and early 2000s will continue to grow as time series lengthen and methods of \nanalysis improve. Observations of the sea-level response prior to the satellite era from \nboth tide gauges and proxy methods provide the length of time series necessary to isolate \nand interpret the climate component and place the more recent changes in context. Even \nthough current uncertainty on global mean and regional sea-level change for the 21st \ncentury is at the metre level, this will no doubt improve in the coming years assuming \nthat observational initiatives are supported. \n \n \nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to Glenn Milne. \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis article stemmed from a meeting hosted by the Geological Society of London in \nSeptember 2008.

The maximum rate of sea-level rise is given for each time \nperiod and reconstruction method (note that rates have been corrected for land motion). \nThe * symbol indicates uncertainties that are tidal range dependent. Some methods \nquantify the error on inferred past sea levels by analyzing the distribution of flora and \nfauna within the tidal zone and so the estimated uncertainty is less in areas with smaller \ntidal range. \n \nFigure 1 \n \nMean rate of sea-surface height change during the period October 1992 to May 2007 \ndetermined from satellite altimetry measurements. Measurements were corrected for the \ninverted barometer effect. The large spatial variability reflects the dominance of \ndynamical ocean processes over this period. The measurement error at a given point is \ndifficult to assess, but probably less than 2 mm\/yr. Variations also occur on many \ndifferent time scales, so that a linear trend is not a statistically significant fit to the time \nseries at most places, the trend is merely indicative of the kind of variability to be found. \n \nFigure 2 \n \nSea-level curves derived from tide gauge data using the \u2018virtual station\u2019 method95 The \nrobustness of each of the regional estimates varies greatly both spatially due the \ngeographic distribution of the stations, with an inherent northern hemisphere bias present \nin the network, and temporarily due to the changing number of stations, with a very \nlimited number of records spanning the entire 20th century. (Adapted from ref. 41.) \n \nFigure 3 \n \nSea levels reconstructed from the geological record at five localities. (a) Barbados53,91; \n(b) Cleveland Bay, Australia96; (c) Pounawea, New Zealand46 ; (d) Angerman River, \nSweden97; (e) Arisaig, Scotland93. These data were chosen to illustrate the spatial and \ntemporal variation in sea-level change during and following the most recent glacial-\ninterglacial transition and the typical time and height precision obtained using commonly \nused reconstruction methods. Note that the data in (D) are obtained from more than one \ntype of sea-level indicator. Note, also, that, at most sites, the data span different time \nperiods. \n \nBox 1: Processes affecting sea level \n \nSea level is measured in one of two ways: relative to the ocean floor (known as \u2018relative \nsea level\u2019) or relative to the Earth\u2019s centre of mass (know as \u2018absolute sea level\u2019). \nSatellite altimetry is the only method that provides a measure of absolute sea level. Both \nrelative and absolute sea level are affected by a wide variety of processes (a). Note that \nabsolute sea level is affected indirectly by deformation of the solid Earth due to the \ncorresponding changes to the gravity field and volume of the global ocean basin. All of \nthe processes depicted in (a) result in a spatially variable sea-level response. \n \nTwo climate-related processes that will play central roles in governing sea-level changes \nover the coming decades to centuries are land ice melting (mass contribution) and ocean \nwater density change due to temperature and salinity changes (steric contribution). The \nspatial variability associated with these processes is depicted, respectively, in (b) and (c). \n \nIt is generally assumed than when land ice melts, the associated sea-level rise is globally \nuniform and proportional to the volume of ice loss. For example, it is often stated that the \nGreenland ice sheet holds about 7 m of global sea-level rise. In reality, the situation is \nmore complex due to the isostatic deformation of the solid Earth along with gravitational \nand rotational changes driven by the ice-ocean mass exchange27,85,98. Frame (b) shows \nmodel predictions of the change in global sea-level if the Greenland (top) or West \nAntarctic (bottom) ice sheets were to lose mass at 1 mm\/yr (10 cm\/century) of global \nmean sea-level equivalent. The predicted response departs significantly from the mean \nwith a reduced rise and even fall in areas close to the ablating ice mass and an amplified \nrise in areas far-removed from the melt source99. \n \nOcean temperature and salinity changes have also been regionally variable in the past and \nestimates of the resulting sea-level change reflect this variability. Frame (c) shows the \nmean rates of sea-level change over the period 1950-2003 estimated from observations of \nocean temperature (taken from ref 100). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     0.0  0.2  0.4  0.6  0.8  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4 \nmm\/yr \n \na b\nc\n-2.0   -1.5   -1.0   -0.5   0.0   0.5    1.0    1.5    2.0 \nmm\/yr \n\n\u2212100\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\n1100\n1200\n1300\nSe\na \nLe\nve\nl (m\nm)\n1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020 2040\n \nBaltic\nNE Atlantic\nMediterranean\nNW Atlantic\nNE Pacific\nIndian\nW Pacific\nCentral Pacific\nSW Atlantic\nae d\nb\nc\n\u221230\n\u221220\n\u221210\n0\nR\nSL\n (m\n)\n\u221210 \u22128 \u22126 \u22124 \u22122 0\nb\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n\u221210 \u22128 \u22126 \u22124 \u22122 0\nd\nTime (kyr)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n\u221215\u221212 \u22129 \u22126 \u22123 0\ne\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.0\n\u22120.6 \u22120.4 \u22120.2 0.0\nc\n\u2212120\n\u221280\n\u221240\n0\n\u221218 \u221212 \u22126 0\na\nTime \nperiod \nSea-level \nindicator \nChronology Max. \nresolution \n(yr) \nEstimated \nvertical \nprecision \n(\u00b1 m) \nMax. rate \n(m\/century)  \nExample \nstudies \n0-470 \nka \nOxygen \nisotopes  \nAMS14C, \npalaeomagnetism, \ntuning \n \n200 12 2.5 6, 88-90  \n0-30 ka Corals U\/Th 400 5 4 53, 91 \n0-20 ka Sediment \nfacies, \nmicrofossils \nAMS14C 200 3 4 54, 92 \n0-16 ka Isolation \nbasin \nstratigraphy \nAMS14C 200 0.2-1.0* n.a. 93 \n0-10 ka Basal peat AMS14C 200 0.2-0.5* 0.2 76 \n0-7 ka Microatolls 14C 200 0.1-0.2* 0.2 77 \n0-7 ka Biological \nindicators on \nrocky coasts \n14C 200 0.05-0.5* 0.1 94 \n0-2 ka Archaeology Historical \ndocumentation \n100 0.1-0.5* 0.1 66 \n0-0.5 \nka \nSalt-marsh \nmicrofossils \nAMS14C, 210Pb, \n137Cs, Pb isotopes, \npollen, \nchemostratigraphy \n20 0.05-0.3* 0.2 46 \n \n"}
