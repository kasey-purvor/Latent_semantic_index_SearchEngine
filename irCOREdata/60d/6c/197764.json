Implications for the study of \nthe psychological influences of the Internet are discussed in this paper. \n \nKey words: Online recreation; Internet; Leisure; Entertainment; Loneliness; self-efficacy \n \nOnline recreation \n 2 \n1. Introduction \nResearchers over the last few years have been very interested in whether the Internet is \ndetrimental to one\u2019s psychological health or whether, instead, it might enhance one\u2019s well-being. \nIn the early stages, researchers emphatically argued that greater use of the Internet was associated \nwith negative effects on an individual (Kraut et al., 1998). More recently, studies have found that \nthe Internet, in contrast, can contribute positively to psychological well-being (Shaw & Gant, \n2002). Arguably, these variations in results could be attributed to the changing nature of the \nInternet, the greater numbers of individuals who use it, as well as its increased accessibility, \naffordability and availability. However, it might also be the case that we are asking the wrong \nquestions. Researchers have contended that cyberspace is not a generic space (Whitty & Carr, \n2003) and that instead of considerations of the Internet as a whole we should focus our attention \non the individual aspects of the Internet. In line with this way of thinking, we were interested in \nwhat types of leisure services lonely individuals are more likely to access online. However, in \naddition to loneliness, we were interested in people\u2019s ability and confidence in using the Internet.  \n In what has become a well known study, Kraut and his colleagues (1998) made the claim \nthat greater use of the Internet was associated with negative effects on an individual, such as \ndecreases in the size of one\u2019s social circle, and increases in depression and loneliness. In Kraut et \nal.\u2019s longitudinal study, households who had never accessed the Internet prior to the study were \nprovided with a computer, a free telephone line and free access to the Internet. During the course \nof the study, they tracked changes in psychological states over time. As stated above, this study \nfound a significant relationship between heavy Internet usage and loneliness. Kraut et al. argued \nthat since initial loneliness failed to predict subsequent loneliness, the most likely explanation \nwas that the increased use of the Internet was what caused the increase in loneliness. In other \nwords, Internet usage was taking up time that could be better used for more psychologically \nOnline recreation \n 3 \nbeneficial interactions offline. Kraut et al. made the claim that online weak ties were being \nestablished which were of poorer quality compared to the types of relationships and strong ties \nalready established offline. \n Kraut et al.\u2019s (1998) \u2018HomeNet Study\u2019 has been widely criticized. One of the major \ncriticisms made was that they only used 3-items from the UCLA to measure loneliness and their \nCronbach\u2019s alpha of .54 was clearly poor (Grohol, 1998). Morahan-Martin (1999) also points out \nthat the sample size was too small and not randomly selected. Perhaps a more important \ncriticism, however, is that Kraut et al.\u2019s findings might only explain novice Internet users \n(LaRose, Eastin, Gregg, 2001). Moreover, as LaRose et al. (2001) have maintained, self-efficacy \nmight be an important variable to consider. The individuals that spent more time online in Kraut \net al.\u2019s study might have been simply ineffective users of the Internet and the stress in trying to \nwork out how to use this new technology might have caused them to become more depressed. \nInterestingly, in the 3-year follow-up to the HomeNet study the same researchers found \nthat almost all of the previously reported negative effects had dissipated (Kraut et al., 2001). \nInstead, higher levels of Internet use were positively correlated with measures of social \ninvolvement and psychological well-being. Perhaps such results might be explained by LaRose et \nal.\u2019s (2001) claim that it is also important to consider self-efficacy. Could it be that the \nparticipants in the HomeNet study became more Internet savvy over time which, in turn, altered \nthe way they used the Internet? \nThe contrasting view to the Internet causing loneliness is that lonely people have a greater \ndesire to use the Internet and can even benefit from doing so. As Morahan-Martin & Schumacher \n(2003) have stated: \n \nThe Internet provides an ideal social environment for lonely people to interact with \nOnline recreation \n 4 \nothers. Not only does it provide a vastly expanded social network, but also it provides \naltered social interaction patterns online that may be particularly attractive to those who \nare lonely. (p.662) \n \nResearch has focused on this alternative view to examine whether lonely people access \nthe Internet to improve their psychological well-being. Shaw and Gant (2002), for instance, found \nthat increased Internet usage was associated with decreased levels of loneliness and depression \nand increased levels of social support and self-esteem. More recently, Oldfield and Howitt (2004) \nfound that those who spent more time on emails were less likely to be lonely. These authors \ncontend that this is possibly because emails were used by individuals in their sample to support \nand maintain friendships, rather than as an alternative to offline friendships. Importantly, Oldfield \nand Howitt (2004) considered the various spaces online, such as chat, shopping, entertainment \nand banking, rather than treating the Internet as one entity. \n We also believe that it is important to consider individual aspects of the Internet. \nConsequently, we decided to focus in this study on the use of the Internet for entertainment. \nInterest in the development of the World Wide Web as a leisure resource, and its use as such, has \ngrown significantly in the past decade. High-speed connections have facilitated advances in this \ninteractive medium (Cho, Byun & Sung, 2003). The \u2018Pew Internet and American Life Project\u2019 \nhas highlighted the increase in Americans\u2019 use of entertainment-related Internet applications \n(Madden, 2003). Seeking out information about a hobby, browsing the Internet for fun, \ndownloading music, viewing sports online and playing games have all increased (Madden, 2003). \nAn increase in popularity of playing games online has also been reported in Europe, arguably \nbecause of increased access and the affordability of Broadband (Nielson\/\/NetRatings, 2003). \nOnline recreation \n 5 \n Most of the work on leisure and the Internet has focused on online gaming (e.g., Griffiths, \nDavies, & Chappell, 2003) and porn (e.g., Mehta, 2001). Much of this research has focused on \nthe detrimental effects of overindulging in online entertainment. While, of course, research on \ntopics such as Internet addiction is important, this current study was more interested in the types \nof people who are more likely to access various forms of entertainment. Importantly, Trew and \nMalle (2004) have made the distinction between active and passive entertainment online. As they \nstate: \u201c[p]assive entertainment allows only minimal interaction between the program and the \nuser\u201d (p.24). Examples, which they give, of passive entertainment include; movies, music and \nmost web pages. According to these same theorists, active entertainment \u201crequires the player to \ninteract with virtual objects and characters in a virtual world\u201d (p.24). In our current study, we \nwere also interested in categorizing entertainment online, rather than considering entertainment \nas a whole. For instance, people can use the Internet to be entertained, such as playing games; \nhowever, they can also use it to find information about entertainment offline. It might be the case \nthat lonely people are more interested in accessing the former than the latter. \n As stated earlier, in addition to considering what spaces lonely people are more likely to \naccess online for entertainment, we were interested in whether self-efficacy also helps determine \nwhat aspects of the Internet individuals are more likely to utilize. According to Eastin and \nLaRose (2000), there are a number of psychological barriers associated with Internet use, some of \nwhich include prior experience, self-efficacy and self-disparagement. They believe that each \nmediates the extent to which people use online resources.  \nBandura (1999) states that self-efficacy is a belief in one\u2019s ability to perform a given task. \nIndividuals with high assurance in their abilities often approach difficult tasks as challenges to be \nmastered, while those who doubt their capabilities shy away from such tasks. A number of \nOnline recreation \n 6 \nstudies have focused on the effects of self-efficacy on the acceptance of computer technology. \nFor example, Compeau and Higgins (1995, 1999) found a positive relationship between computer \nself-efficacy and computer usage. Arguably, use of the Internet requires further skills (Eastin & \nLaRose, 2000). For example, individuals must learn how to establish and maintain an Internet \nconnection, learn how to effectively surf the World Wide Web, as well as be able to use the \nmultitude of applications it offers. This may be daunting, particularly for novices with little \ncomputer experience (Igbaria & Iivari, 1995). Early research on Internet self-efficacy \nconcentrated primarily on the execution of particular tasks, such as entering Web addresses and \ncreating bookmarks. Ren (1999), for example, conducted a study that measured levels of Internet \nself-efficacy specific to searching for government information resources. Ren found a positive \ncorrelation between perceptions of self-efficacy and levels of Internet use. This current study \nintends to add to this growing literature by considering the relationship between Internet self-\nefficacy and the use of the Internet for entertainment. \nWhile previous research has examined the relationship between loneliness and Internet \nusage and self-efficacy and Internet usage few have considered these together. Moreover, there is \ncurrently a dearth of research available on the types of people who are more likely to use the \nInternet for entertainment. It is the aim of this paper to examine the relationship between \nloneliness, Internet self-efficacy and using the Internet for various forms of entertainment. Based \non the previous research outlined above, we expected that lonely people would be more likely to \nuse the Internet for entertainment and that those higher in Internet self-efficacy would be more \nlikely to use the Internet for entertainment. \n \nOnline recreation \n 7 \n2. Method \n2.1. Participants \nThe participants were 150 undergraduate students (75 male and 75 female) enrolled at \nQueen\u2019s University, Belfast. Ages ranged from 18 - 25 years, with a mean of 20.61 years (SD = \n1.68). All participants had access to free Internet facilities on campus, whether they chose to use \nthem or not. The majority of the sample (80%) also had the Internet at home. Thirty-one percent \nof participants were also able to connect to the Internet via their mobile phones. Other points of \naccess included local libraries and Internet cafes. Forty-two percent of the sample reported \nhaving access to a Broadband connection. \n \n2.2. Materials \nDemographic Questions: Participants were firstly asked a number of demographic details \nsuch as age, gender, and where they accessed the Internet. \nOnline Entertainment Survey: An \u2018Online Entertainment Scale\u2019 was developed \nspecifically for this research project. Previous research, in particular work carried out in the \u2018Pew \nInternet & American Life Project\u2019 (Madden, 2003), was drawn upon to aid in selecting items for \nthis survey. A range of entertainment available online was considered, including, online gaming, \nusing chat rooms, downloading music, viewing porn, reading online magazines, shopping, \nsurfing the web, finding information about celebrities, and so forth. Moreover, we included items \non accessing the Internet to either be informed about or to access entertainment offline, such as \npurchasing tickets, information about offline hobbies, and information about current sporting \nevents. We piloted the survey twice before coming up with the final survey of 14 items. Each \nitem of the scale was rated by frequency of use on a five-point scale, with higher scores \nindicating greater use of the Internet for entertainment purposes. \nOnline recreation \n 8 \n \nInternet Self-Efficacy Scale: Eastin and LaRose\u2019s (2000) \u2018Internet Self-Efficacy Scale\u2019 \nwas used in this study. Participants were asked to respond to a series of eight statements based on \na Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). This measure included \nstatements such as \u2018I feel confident troubleshooting Internet problems\u2019 and \u2018I feel confident using \nthe Internet to gather data\u2019. Higher scores indicated higher levels of Internet self-efficacy. In \nrespect of reliability, this scale produced an internally consistent Cronbach\u2019s alpha of .93, which \nis identical to the score reported by Eastin and LaRose (2000). \nUCLA Loneliness Scale: The \u2018UCLA Loneliness Scale\u2019 (Russell, 1996) was also \nemployed in this study. This simplified measure of loneliness included a total of 20 items, 11 or \nwhich are negatively worded (lonely) and 9 of which are positively worded (non-lonely). Higher \ntotal scores indicated greater degrees of loneliness. A reliability analysis of this scale revealed a \nCronbach\u2019s alpha of .92, which is similar to Russell (1996) who reported internally consistent \nalpha coefficients of .89 to .94. \n \n2.3. Procedure  \nAfter obtaining the approval of the ethics committee at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, \nparticipants were recruited from a library on campus. In order to gain access to these facilities, \nlibrary staff were contacted and briefed about the investigation. Testing only began when the \ninformed consent of the library manager had been secured. An opportunistic sampling technique \nwas employed to recruit participants over a two-day period. Although a number of students were \napproached, only undergraduates aged 18 \u2013 25 years were invited to participate. This was \ncontrolled for a number of reasons. Firstly, young adults are the heaviest recreational users of \nInternet technology and have been the primary expediters of the development of entertainment-\nOnline recreation \n 9 \nrelated Internet applications (Madden, 2003). Students are also thought to be particularly \nvulnerable to pervasive feelings of loneliness, often attributed to the changes associated with this \nstage of development (Nurmi & Salmela, 1997). Test materials were administered to suitable \ncandidates who were instructed to seal completed questionnaires in the envelopes provided. \nResponses were then collected for further analysis.  \n \n3. Results \nRatings on the \u2018Online Entertainment Scale\u2019 were subjected to an exploratory factor \nanalysis. Before subjecting the scale to principal axis factoring the data were assessed to ensure \nsuitability for analysis. None of the assumptions were violated. The correlation matrix revealed a \nnumber of coefficients of .3 and above. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olken measure of sampling adequacy \nwas .73 which exceeded the recommended value of .6 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). The \nBartlett\u2019s Test of Sphericity also reached statistical significance, supporting the factorability of \nthe correlation matrix.  \nPrincipal axis factoring revealed the presence of 5 components with eigenvalues \nexceeding 1. Together, they accounted for 44.1% of the total variance (23.7%, 6.9%, 6.0%, 4.3% \nand 3.1% respectively). A closer look at the data suggested that not all of the extracted factors \nshould be retained for rotation. The fourth and fifth components appeared to be statistically \nweaker than the others, with borderline eigenvalues of 1.10 and 1.00 respectively. Together they \naccounted for a meager 7.4% of the total variance. Moreover, although two items loaded onto \neach of these components, the factor matrix showed evidence of crossloading. Inspection of the \nscreeplot confirmed suspicions that only the first three factors should be retained for rotation. \nThese components were separated obliquely by Direct Oblimin, which allowed for the possibility \nof intercorrelation among factors. Only items with loadings of .4 and above were considered for \nOnline recreation \n 10 \nfurther analysis. This eliminated crossloading and helped to made the rotation more \nparsimonious. The rotated factor solution took 6 iterations to produce and is reported in Table 1. \n \nTable 1 \nFactor Pattern Matrix \n \n \n \nEigenvalues \nFactor 1 \n(3.85) \nFactor 2 \n(1.44) \nFactor 3 \n(1.30) \nHow often do you use the Internet to download\/ listen \nto music? .782 -.150 -.066 \nHow often do you use the Internet to download\/ view \nfilms\/other entertainment-related broadcasts? .677 -.058 .097 \nHow often do you use the Internet to participate in \nonline chat groups? .490 .047 -.020 \nHow often do you visit music-related websites to find \nout about music events\/chart releases? .467 .080 .057 \nHow often do you download\/play games online? \n .403 .272 -.062 \nHow often do you use the Internet to access material \nwith pornographic content? .299 .039 .101 \nHow often do you use the Internet to search for \ninformation on sports\/sports events? .040 .769 -.188 \nHow often do you go online to access information \nabout your hobbies? -.108 .683 .104 \nHow often do you use the Internet to download\/ read \nonline books, newspapers or magazines? .050 .367 .149 \nHow often do you browse Internet as a means of \nentertaining yourself? .204 .345 .136 \nHow often do you go online to find out about the latest \ncinema releases? .106 -.006 .700 \nHow often do you use the Internet to access \ninformation about celebrities and showbiz events? .015 .021 .602 \nHow often do you \u2018surf the web\u2019 to find out about \nupcoming events\/entertainment in your local area? .195 .263 .278 \nHow often do you purchase goods online (including \nitems such as travel\/concert tickets)? -.019 -.009 .272 \nNote. The higher factor loading for each item appears in boldface type. \n \nFactor 1 was labeled as \u2018Use of the Internet for computer-based entertainment\u2019. This \nfactor included both social (e.g., chat) and potentially, but not necessarily, isolated (e.g., \nOnline recreation \n 11 \ndownloading films and music) forms of entertainment. However, what they had in common was \nthat the entertainment was provided online (we argue that individuals are not necessarily isolated \ngiven that one can download movies or music with others offline). Factor 2 was labeled \u2018Use of \nthe Internet to facilitate offline entertainment\u2019. The third factor was labeled \u2018Use of the Internet \nfor information about the entertainment world.\u2019 All three were moderately correlated with one \nanother (see Table 2). Factor based scales were generated by summating the relevant items. All \nthree were internally consistent, with Cronbach alpha values of .70 for Factor 1, .63 for Factor 2 \nand .64 for Factor 3.   \n \nTable 2 \nCorrelation matrix \n \nFactor 1 2 3 \n1.

Prior to performing these analyses, the \nsuitability of each data set was assessed. None of the assumptions were violated. \nIn the first regression analysis, \u2018Use of the Internet for computer-based entertainment\u2019 \nwas entered as the dependent variable. The results (reported in Table 3) indicated that both \nInternet self-efficacy \u03b2 = .38, t = 4.98, p < .001 and loneliness \u03b2 = .15, t = 2.00, p < .05 were \nsignificant predictors of this variable, F (2, 147) = 13.24, p<.001. This supported our hypothesis. \nTogether, they accounted for 15.3% of the total variance. \nOnline recreation \n 12 \nTable 3 \nFactor 1-\u2018Use of the Internet for computer-based entertainment \u2019 \n \n R2 Beta \nInternet Self-Efficacy .153 .38*** Loneliness .15* \n*p < .05 \n**p < .01 \n***p < .001 \n \n \nIn the second regression, \u2018Use of the Internet to facilitate offline entertainment\u2019 was \nentered as the dependent variable.

Discussion \n The factor analysis performed in this study revealed three forms of online entertainment. \nThese were, using the Internet a) for computer-based entertainment, b) to facilitate offline \nentertainment, and c) for information about the entertainment world. The regression analyses \nfound only partial support for our hypothesis that lonely people would be more likely to use the \nInternet for entertainment and that those higher in Internet self-efficacy would be more likely to \nuse the Internet for entertainment. For the first factor, lonely people and people higher in Internet \nself-efficacy were more likely to use the Internet for computer-based entertainment. For the \nsecond factor, people higher in Internet self-efficacy were more likely to use the Internet to \nfacilitate offline entertainment. For the third factor, lonely people were more likely to use the \nInternet for information about the entertainment world. \n This study revealed that undergraduates with higher levels of Internet self-efficacy are \nmore likely to use the Internet for computer-based entertainment. This result is not surprising \nwhen you consider the items that loaded onto this factor. For instance, specific skills (such as \nknowledge of how to use certain software) are required to download music and videos and to \nplay games online. According to Bandura (1999), individuals with weak self-efficacy beliefs \nOnline recreation \n 14 \noften find novel tasks daunting. Focusing on personal deficiencies may hinder users from \ninteracting with challenging web-based entertainment applications like those evident in Factor 1. \nAlthough loneliness made less of a contribution towards predicting the use of the Internet \nfor computer-based entertainment, the relationship, as predicted, was still significant. Morahan-\nMartin (1999) maintains that the Internet is \u2018custom tailored\u2019 for the lonely. The Internet \nrepresents a safe, low-risk social environment for lonely people. Some of the items which loaded \non Factor 1, such as participating in chat rooms and playing games online, were exemplars of \nsocial aspects of the Internet. Others were potentially isolated activities (e.g., downloading \nmusic). However, each of these activities could be substitutes for engaging in face-to-face \ninteractions. \nThis study also found that those higher in Internet self-efficacy were more likely to use \nthe Internet to facilitate offline entertainment. Again, this result can be explained when you \nconsider the items that loaded onto this factor. Searching for information about sporting events or \ninformation about one\u2019s hobbies requires further skills than simply aimlessly \u2018surfing the web\u2019. \nFor instance, one needs to know where to look and what specific search terms to type into a \nsearch engine. It might be easier for the less Internet savvy to utilize other media, such as \nnewspapers or magazines, to find the same information. In addition, it is perhaps not so \nsurprising that loneliness failed to predict the use of the Internet to facilitate offline \nentertainment, given that the more lonely people in our sample presumably have less social \ncontacts and engage in less social activities offline. \nWe did, however, find that loneliness was associated with the use of the Internet to obtain \ninformation about the entertainment world. In line with claims made by previous researchers, the \nmore lonely individuals in our study were perhaps more attracted to the Internet for entertainment \nas an alternative to offline entertainment (Shaw & Gant, 2002). Arguably, these individuals might \nOnline recreation \n 15 \nhave engaged in such activities as an escape to the outside world. \nOverall, this study adds an important contribution to the scant research currently available \non the types of people who are more likely to use the Internet for entertainment. It also supports \nthe notion put forth by previous researchers that there is a relationship between lonely people and \nthe use of the Internet (e.g., Kraut et al., 1998). More importantly, it demonstrates that even when \nwe consider solely entertainment online that we cannot treat the Internet as one generic space. \nFurthermore, other variables, such as Internet self efficacy play an important role in determining \nif an individual is going to utilize the resources available online. An implication of such a finding \nis that if researchers find that use of the Internet for entertainment is beneficial for lonely people, \nthen we might want to train these individuals to use the Internet more effectively.  \n Of course, we recognize that there are some shortcomings to this present study. These \nresults, for instance, can only be generalized to educated young people. Future research might \nreveal some age differences in individuals\u2019 preferences for using the Internet for \nentertainment. For example, using the Internet to download music and play games might be \nan activity preferred by younger people. A more important limitation is that we were unable \nto ascertain in this study whether lonely individuals were more likely to go to the Internet for \nentertainment as a replacement for offline activities or if engaging in these activities caused \nthem to be lonely. As Morahan-Martin (1999) warns us, turning to the Internet to escape the \ndiscomfort of everyday life can sometimes lead to Internet addiction. Hence, we are yet to \ndetermine if it is a psychologically healthy activity for lonely people to use the Internet for \nentertainment. Moreover, it might be that engaging in certain online activities causes one to \nbecome high in Internet self-efficacy, rather than individuals high in Internet self-efficacy \nturning to the Internet for certain forms of entertainment. Longitudinal research is required to \ntest out these claims. Future research might also consider how online activities are combined \nOnline recreation \n 16 \nwith offline activities. Even though it is possible for individuals to split the cyber-world off \nfrom the offline world (see for example, Whitty & Carr, in press), online communication is \noften not separate to the rest of one\u2019s life.  \nIn conclusion, the Internet continues to increase in popularity, especially in respect to \nentertainment (Madden, 2003). Therefore, it is important for researchers to consider what types \nof people are more likely to access the Internet for entertainment and whether this has any \npsychological benefits or costs. Our study begins to do just that and adds to previous claims that \nlonely people and people higher in Internet self-efficacy are more likely to use some resources \nonline. However, more research is required to determine if use of these resources has \npsychological benefits or, instead, is detrimental to one\u2019s psychological well-being. \nOnline recreation \n 17 \nReferences \nBandura, A.
