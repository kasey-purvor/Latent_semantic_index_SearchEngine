An analysis of Iridium spacecraft mag-\nnetometer measurements provided estimates of large-scale\nionospheric FAC in relation to the AWFC evolution. Peak\nflows in the AWFC were located close to the peak of a Region\n2 downward FAC, located just poleward of the plasmapause.\nDMSP satellite observations confirmed the AWFC was lo-\ncated equatorward of the nightside plasmasheet, sometimes\nassociated with \u223c10 keV ion precipitation.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Electric fields\nand currents; Ionosphere-magnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nThe circulation of plasma at high latitudes is controlled by\nthe solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction, and\nsubsequent internal reconfigurations of the magnetosphere,\nwhereas the circulation of plasma in the mid-latitude iono-\nsphere is approximately co-rotational. However, the mid-\nlatitude ionosphere actually circulates under the influence of\nthe tidal dynamo and prompt penetration fields (Fejer, 1997).\nThe latter are generated when the under (over-) shielding\ncondition develops in response to rapid changes in the mag-\nnetospheric current system (Kelley et al., 1979). When ge-\nomagnetic activity increases, prompt penetration drifts are\nenhanced toward the west in the evening sector ionosphere\nat mid-latitudes (Parkinson et al., 2001). There is often a\nsharp delineation between the equatorward limit of high-\nlatitude magnetospheric convection and the approximately\nco-rotational mid-latitude regime. This feature is known\nas the flow reversal boundary (FRB) (Huang et al., 2001),\nand should not be confused with the convection reversal\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n60 M. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC)\nboundary, a feature approximately coincident with the polar\ncap boundary.\nThe FRB is indicated, and perhaps formed by, the \u201csubau-\nroral polarisation stream\u201d (SAPS) (Foster and Burke, 2002).\nSAPS refers to a broad channel of moderate westward flow\n(\u223c100 to 400 m s\u22121) usually associated with the develop-\nment of a polarisation field across the main ionospheric\ntrough in the dusk to post-midnight sector. Because the\nSAPS resides on the equatorward edge of the return sun-\nward flow of the dawn convection cell, the FRB can be es-\npecially well defined beyond midnight. The relationship be-\ntween SAPS and the ring current (RC) was investigated using\nCRRES spacecraft measurements of electric and magnetic\nfields (Wygant et al., 1998; Burke et al., 1998).\nGalperin et al. (1973) originally discovered polarisation\njets (PJs), very narrow channels (<1 to 2\u25e63) of intense west-\nward plasma flow (500 m s\u22121 to>4 km s\u22121) forming in prox-\nimity to SAPS. PJs have been referred to by various terms\nincluding sub-auroral ions drifts (SAID) (Spiro et al., 1979),\nsubstorm-associated radar auroral surges (SARAS) (Free-\nman et al., 1992; Shand et al., 1998), sub-auroral electric\nfields (SAEF) (Karlsson et al., 1998), and auroral westward\nflow channels (AWFC) (Parkinson et al., 2003a). The di-\nverse SAPS nomenclature has arisen from observations of\ndifferent aspects of the same phenomena, and the important\ndistinctions need to be reconciled.\nAWFCs may represent the poleward most subset of\nPJ\/SAIDs which emerge at substorm onset. In terms of\nelectric fields, AWFCs are the strongest signature of sub-\nstorms (Parkinson et al., 2006). Parkinson et al. (2003a) sug-\ngested AWFCs feed the development of the SAPS. Defining\nthe relationship between AWFCs and the main population\nof PJ\/SAIDs and SAPS occurring further equatorward will\nrequire a latitudinal chain of sub-auroral radars making con-\ntinuous observations throughout the entire substorm cycle.\nDefining this morphology is important because of its impli-\ncations for the development of field-aligned current (FAC)\nand polarisation fields within the inner magnetosphere, and\nenergisation of the radiation belts and the RC during major\nstorms.\nParkinson et al. (2003a) identified AWFCs with the Tas-\nman International Geospace Environment Radar (TIGER)\n(147.2\u25e6 E, 43.4\u25e6 S Geodetic; \u221255\u25e6 magnetic) (Dyson and\nDevlin, 2000; Dyson et al., 2003, 2005) an element of the\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). A de-\nscription of SuperDARN radar design and operation has been\ngiven by Greenwald et al. (1985, 1995). In this study, we\nestablish the relationship between AWFC evolution and the\nlocation of large-scale ionospheric FAC, the RC, and plasma-\npause location. The large-scale FAC was provided by an\nanalysis of Iridium satellite measurements (Waters et al.,\n2001). The relative location of the RC and plasmapause\nwere provided by a magnetically conjugate perigee crossing\nof the nightside plasmasphere by the four Cluster satellites\n(Escoubet et al., 1997). Observations made using the Imager\nfor Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE)\nspacecraft (Mende et al., 2000a, b) were also used to identify\nthe relationship between the AWFC and plasmapause mor-\nphology. The polar orbiting Defence Meteorological Satel-\nlite Program (DMSP) satellites also placed the AWFC in the\ncontext of auroral oval boundaries.\n2 Observations and results\nIn this study, we concentrate on the analysis of observations\nmade by ground-based magnetometers, a suite of spacecraft\nincluding the Cluster satellites, IMAGE, and the Iridium\u00ae\nconstellation, and the TIGER Tasmania radar during 06:00\u2013\n14:00 UT on 7 April 2001. The second TIGER New Zealand\nradar did not commence operations until late 2004.\nThe radar measurements were mapped to altitude adjusted\ncorrected geomagnetic (AACGM) coordinates (Baker and\nWing, 1989) using the standard algorithm which assumes\nrectilinear radio-wave propagation to F-region backscatter\nlocations at a virtual height of 300 km. Although the true\nmapping from group delay to ground range will change\nwith propagation conditions, the standard mapping proce-\ndure is usually considered accurate to <0.5\u25e6 for half-hop\nionospheric scatter (Yeoman et al., 2001).\nThe magnetic coordinates of the low-altitude satellite mea-\nsurements were calculated using the AACGM algorithm, but\nthe high-altitude Cluster measurements were mapped using\nthe Tsyganenko 96 (T96) model (Tsyganenko, 1995; Tsyga-\nnenko and Stern, 1996). Hence the problem of coordinate\nregistration between these diverse data sets was minimised.\n2.1 Solar wind and geomagnetic conditions\nThe Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft was\nlocated upstream in the solar wind during 7 April 2001. ACE\nmagnetometer (Smith et al., 1998) observations of the inter-\nplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are available online and they\nrevealed Bz had several excursions to values more negative\nthan\u22126 nT during 00:00 to 07:00 UT, then theBx , By andBz\ncomponents were predominately \u223c+4 nT, \u22122 nT and \u22122 nT,\nrespectively, during 07:00 to 14:00 UT. However, Bz had sev-\neral excursions to \u22124 nT. ACE solar wind electron proton\nalpha monitor (SWEPAM) (McComas et al., 1998) observa-\ntions showed the solar wind speed was \u223c440 m s\u22121 and the\ndynamic pressure \u223c1 nPa. However, there was significant\nstructure in the dynamic pressure during 07:58 to 08:33 UT\n(this time interval is shaded in Fig. 1), including a distinct\ndynamic pressure pulse (DPP) from \u223c0.7 to 2.1 nPa arriv-\ning during 08:10 to 08:16 UT. The arrival time of the DPP\nat the magnetopause was calculated using a lag of 58.9 min\nestimated using the method of Khan and Cowley (1999).\nFigure 1a shows key geomagnetic indices for 7 April.

The recovery of the\nsecond substorm finished at 06:02 UT. An active interval\nwith AL\u223c\u2212200 nT ensued until a large, distinct \u2212946 nT\nsubstorm (3) commenced during 17:00 UT. Variations in the\nKp index were consistent with the sequence of substorms.\nThe first two substorms were associated with a decrease in\nthe Dst index from \u221210 nT at 00:00\u201301:00 UT to \u221242 nT at\n07:00\u201308:00 UT. Dst slowly increased beyond 12:00 UT.\nThe Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites\nare in geosynchronous, equatorial orbits of radius 6.6RE ,\ncorresponding to a magnetic latitude of \u223c\u221266.5\u25e6 in the\nradar observations. The Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyz-\ners (SOPA) measured a succession of flux decreases and in-\ncreases of outer radiation belt electrons in the energy range\n50 KeV and 26 MeV associated with the three substorms.\nThe horizontal bars in Fig. 1b indicated the approximate time\nintervals when major, rapid increases and decreases in ener-\ngetic particle flux were observed. The final increase in parti-\ncle flux associated with the first two substorms was detected\nby LANL 1991-080 during 07:12 to 08:15 UT. Thereafter,\nthe LANL satellites detected a gradual halving of the parti-\ncle fluxes during the radar observations of the AWFC.\nA fluxgate magnetometer is located on Macquarie Is.\n(MQI) (\u221265\u25e6 magnetic), just to the east of TIGER beam\n15 (see Fig. 8).

Figure 1b is a summary plot of mag-\nnetic perturbations in the geomagnetic X (North), Y (East),\nand Z (down) directions during 7 April. These components\nwere de-spiked and then de-trended by subtracting a base-\nline defined by averaging their values over 5\u20139 April which\nincluded extended quiet intervals.\nThe AL index revealed a\u2212529 nT substorm during 03:00\u2013\n06:00 UT. This substorm was detected as a coincident 343 nT\nincrease in the geomagnetic X component by the MQI mag-\nnetometer, indicative of an enhanced eastward electrojet in\nthe afternoon convection cell. Figure 1b shows there was an-\nother increase in the X component to 250 nT during 07:01 to\n07:46 UT. This corresponds to an enhancement of the east-\nward electrojet in the dusk convection cell. There was an-\nother 114-nT spike in the X component at 09:52 UT.\nDuring 05:00 to 10:00 UT, the Z component was initially\nlarge and negative, but gradually converged upon the same\nsmall value as the X component. This suggests the eastward\nelectrojet was located several degrees equatorward of MQI,\nand then gradually contracted to the latitude of MQI (\u221265\u25e6).\nBeyond about 12:00 UT, the electrojet contracted poleward\nof MQI. Throughout the AWFC, the ionospheric Hall current\nfluctuated, but gradually became more negative, consistent\nwith the rotation of MQI from the pre-midnight region dom-\ninated by the eastward electrojet toward the post-midnight\nregion dominated by the westward electrojet.\n2.2 Cluster satellite observations\nThe four Cluster satellites (Escoubet et al., 2001) underwent\na perigee crossing of the nightside plasmasphere between\n\u223c10:22 to 11:20 UT on 7 April 2001.

Cluster 3 reached a perigee of R\u223c4.0RE at \u223c10:42 UT\nwhen it was located at X=\u22123.26, Y=2.31, and Z=\u22120.36RE\nin geocentric solar ecliptic (GSE) coordinates. Near perigee,\nthe planarity and elongation of the tetrahedron were \u223c0.1\nand 0.8, respectively (i.e. the four satellites were aligned like\na string of beads with similar trajectories).\nThe magnetic field lines shown in Fig. 2 were traced using\nthe T96 model parameterised by the lagged ACE solar wind\nconditions. These field lines indicate the equatorial plane\nof the dipole field and thus the peak ring current (RC) was\nencountered above the X\u2212Y GSM plane. The ionospheric\nfootprint of the Cluster trajectories to be shown in Fig. 8\nwere also calculated using T96. Cluster 3 reached a mini-\nmum magnetic latitude of \u221259.4\u25e6 and L shell of \u223c5 at 21:40\nmagnetic local time (MLT) and 10:44 UT. This corresponds\nto the outer plasmasphere.\nThe Waves of High frequency and Sounder for Prob-\ning Electron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) instrument\n(De\u00b4cre\u00b4au et al., 1993, 1997) was used to identify plasma-\npause locations. Trotignon et al. (2001) explains how the\nWHISPER measurements can be used to determine electron\ndensity, and Canu et al. (2001) discuss the natural plasma\nemissions observed close to the plasmapause. WHISPER\ndata are extremely rich and the subject of ongoin interpreta-\ntion, but the basic resonances observed in the ambient plasma\ninclude the plasma, electron gyro-, upper-hybrid, and Bern-\nstein\u2019s mode frequencies. All of these resonances change in\nfrequency with plasma density, except the electron gyrofre-\nquency and its harmonics.\nFigure 3 (bottom panel) presents a frequency versus time\nspectrogram from the WHISPER instrument on board the\nCluster 3 spacecraft showing dynamic variations in 2\u201380 kHz\nsignal level during 09:00 to 12:00 UT on 7 April 2001. The\nalmost continuous horizontal lines in the plot are resonances\nat the electron gyrofrequency and its harmonics. Plasma-\npause (PP) crossings were identified from the start (PPs)\nand finish (PPf ) times of the rapid increases (decreases) in\nthe plasma, upper-hybrid, and Bernstein\u2019s mode frequencies\nduring entry (exit) of the plasmasphere. These resonances\nbecome >80 kHz when Cluster was deep inside the plasma-\nsphere. Table 1 lists the results, two sets for each satellite,\ncomprising plasmasphere entry and exit times. Magnetic co-\nordinates in the ionosphere were estimated using T96.\nThe Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations\n(STAFF) instrument (Cornilleau-Wehrlin et al., 1997) mea-\nsured bursts of 80 Hz to >3 kHz VLF electric and mag-\nnetic field activity confined to the outer plasmasphere, com-\nplementing the WHISPER plasmapause signatures.

During\n09:30 to 12:00 UT, the CIS-COmposition and DIstribution\nFunction analyser (CODIF) measured peak ion fluxes in the\nenergy range \u223c1 keV to 10 keV in the plasma sheet-RC re-\ngion, with the energy spread narrowing to \u223c10 keV within\nthe outer plasmasphere (L\u223c5). The peak ion fluxes are at\nhigher energy than the two RC examples reported by Val-\nlat et al. (2005), perhaps because the satellites penetrated to\nL\u223c4 for those events. The CIS-Hot Ion Analyser (HIA) mea-\nsured peak ion densities of\u223c110 cm\u22123 within the outer plas-\nmasphere (5 eV\u201332 keV). These data sets are not shown for\nbrevity.\nThe Cluster Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) instruments\n(Balogh et al., 1997, 2001) consist of two triaxial fluxgate\nmagnetometers on each satellite. They provide up to 67 vec-\ntor samples s\u22121 with high resolution, up to 8 pT. Vallet et\nal. (2005) have discussed the use of these magnetometer data\nand particle pressure data to calculate current densities. They\ndemonstrated the use of the curlometer technique to estimate\nRC densities during Cluster perigee passes. They measured\nfilamentary structures concentrated in the plasma sheet, but\nalso in the RC. However, the curlometer technique assumes\nall four satellites lie within the same current sheet, and was\nnot used here because of the relatively large elongation of\nthe tetrahedron. The satellite separations were also up to\n\u223c103 km, too large for reliable curlometery.\nHowever, Ampere\u2019s right-hand rule for magnetic circu-\nlation was used to gain insights into the relative locations\nof FAC and the RC. First, the large-scale secular magnetic\nfield was modelled using T96 and appropriate solar wind pa-\nrameters. These large-scale fields were subtracted from the\nFGM measurements to obtain perturbations about the model\nvalues. The amplitude of the large-scale T96 fields were\n\u223c500 nT, whereas the FGM perturbations were only in the\norder of 10 nT (\u223c2%). Figure 4 shows the Cluster 3 FGM\nperturbations in the GSM coordinate system.\nFigure 4d shows that 1BTotal had local maxima at \u223c09:45\nand 11:40 UT, with crossings of the origin at 10:04 and\n11:27 UT, outside of the WHISPER plasmasphere (Table 1).\nThe main feature of 1BTotal was a negative dip to a mini-\nmum value of \u221221 nT located at 10:40 UT, near to the time\n 39 \n \n \nFig. 4.

The RC flows toward the west (+Y ), and will\nenhance (suppress) 1Bz measured at a greater (lesser) ra-\ndial distance than the RC. The decreases in 1BTotal and 1Bz\nare taken to indicate a stronger RC effect than allowed for\nin T96. Figure 4, and similar results for the other Cluster\nsatellites, suggest a RC enhancement was concentrated near\n4.1\u20134.3RE with its near-Earth edge overlapping the plasma-\npause located at 4.1RE .\nIn the case of a polar low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\ntraversing geomagnetic field lines orthoganol to the Earth\u2019s\nsurface, the presence of an infinite FAC sheet can be inferred\nby applying Ampere\u2019s right-hand rule to the 1By compo-\nnent. FAC away from the ionosphere should occur where\n1By \/ds>0, and FAC toward the ionosphere should occur\nwhere 1By \/ds<0. Here s is spatial distance along the satel-\nlite trajectory, increasing in the GSM Z direction. Similarly,\nthe presence of azimuthal (zonal) field perpendicular current\nsheet can be inferred from the1Bx component. Current flow\ntoward the east should occur where 1Bx \/ds >0, and toward\nthe west where 1Bx \/ds<0.\nFigure 5 estimates currents in this way for all four satel-\nlites. The Cluster orbits were thought of as slices confined\nwithin the GSM X\u2212Z plane to simplify the analysis, and\nthe changing speed of the satellites along their trajectories\nwas allowed for. However, the results are merely indicative\nof real FAC for the following reasons. (i) The high altitude\nCluster trajectories intersect the main geomagnetic field in a\ndifferent way to the geometry of LEO measurements. E.g.\nthe magnitude of the currents near to Cluster perigees were\nprobably greater than indicated because the satellites became\nparallel to the magnetic field. (ii) FACs located at 4\u20135RE\nare located above the auroral acceleration region, and thus\nshould differ from FACs in the topside ionosphere inferred\nusing Iridium magnetometer measurements. (iii) The FAC\nsheets were not infinite in extent.\nNevertheless, this first-order analysis provides clues about\nthe relation between AWFC and plasma sheet currents. The\nmagnetic derivatives were extremely bursty when examined\nat a temporal resolution equivalent to the spin-period of the\nspacecraft (\u223c4 s). The inferred current sheets were also in-\nconsistent from one satellite to the next during the inbound\npassage through the auroral region, \u223c\u221272\u25e6 to \u221264\u25e6 mag-\nnetic. Hence the currents shown in Fig. 5 were smoothed at\na temporal scale of 412-s, corresponding to a spatial scale\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 59\u201376, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/\nM. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC) 65\nof \u223c2000 km, to reveal any large-scale features. The strong\nfilamentation of the currents is consistent with the multi-\nfractal properties of the plasma sheet (Lui, 2002). The fil-\namentation of the current decreased upon entry into the RC-\nplasmasphere region, as found by Vallat et al. (2005).\nFigure 5 suggests the AWFC (shaded) was located at the\ntransition between a downward FAC at \u223c\u221262\u25e6 and an up-\nward FAC at \u223c\u221264\u25e6 during the inbound crossing (however,\nnote the filamentation of the currents at this time). Figure 5\nalso suggests the AWFC was located at the equatorward edge\nof a downward current which increased in magnitude fur-\nther poleward during the outbound crossing. The AWFC and\nCluster measurements were made in opposite hemispheres\nduring the outbound crossing. Figure 9 will reveal the AWFC\nwas far more intense at the time of the inbound crossing than\nthe outbound crossing. However, the FACs were more coher-\nent and stable during the outbound crossing; hence the notion\nof a large-scale FAC was more meaningful. Figure 8 will\nshow the AWFC was coincident with downward Region 2\ncurrent.\nLui et al. (2002) used a sign singularity analysis to show\nhow the plasma sheet evolved from random-like Brown-\nian motion fluctuations before substorm onset, to full-scale\nMHD turbulence during current disruption. Large-scale co-\nherent structures formed during the substorm recovery phase.\nIn our event, the filamentation of the auroral current sheets\nwas stronger during the inbound passes of Cluster than the\noutbound passes, and suggests the gradual formation of\nlarge-scale coherent structure during the declining phase of\nthe AWFC, again suggesting an intimate relationship to sub-\nstorm dynamics.\n2.3 IMAGE EUV satellite observations\nThe IMAGE Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV) (Sandel et\nal., 2000) images the distribution of He+ in Earth\u2019s plas-\nmasphere by detecting its resonantly-scattered emission at\n30.4 nm.

(2001) describe the main features visible in\nEUV images. In Fig. 6, the Sun is located toward the bottom\nand the brightest ring is day glow. The Earth\u2019s shadow points\ntoward the top and a faint image of the auroral oval can be\nseen displaced toward this shadow.

Other notches and shoulders are\nvisible along the dayside plasmapause.\nIt will be shown that the AWFC was located in the dusk-to-\nmidnight sector, just beyond the plasmapause associated with\nthe drainage plume (Fig. 6, top right quadrant). The plasma-\npause boundary often formed a \u201cstraight edge\u201d extending\nfrom near midnight along the outer edge of the drainage\nplume. The AWFC may have been associated with this fea-\nture.\nThe latest version of the \u201ceuv imtool\u201d software available\nfrom the IMAGE EUV web page was used to manually scale\nthe location of the relevant plasmapause boundary. The soft-\nware calculated the minimum L shell and magnetic longitude\nfor every mouse click. These points were then mapped to\nmagnetic latitude in the ionosphere using the IGRF model\nwhich does not allow for the effects of external currents.\nHowever, the Cluster WHISPER plasmapause locations were\nmapped to the ionosphere using T96. Hence the Cluster\nplasmapause locations were used to correct the IMAGE EUV\nplasmapause locations. This involved applying a systematic\n\u223c1\u25e6 poleward shift to the latter. The IMAGE EUV results\nhave been overlaid using bold black triangles in subsequent\nfigures.\n2.4 Iridium\u00ae satellite observations\nThe Iridium satellite constellation consist of 66 satellites\nin 780-km altitude polar orbits arranged in six equally\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/ Ann.

Southern Hemisphere maps of FAC density calculated using\nIridium satellite measurements of cross-track magnetic field pertur-\nbations. The calculations were made using an accumulation time of\n\u223c1 h, and the resolution is \u223c4\u25e6 in latitude and \u223c2 h in MLT. The\nresults are presented in the form of a 24-h clock dial plot of MLT\nand AACGM latitude from \u221250\u25e6 to the pole. The sign convention\nused is positive (red) for current into the ionosphere, and negative\n(blue) for current out of the ionosphere.

Iridium engineering magnetometers measure\nthe cross-track magnetic field perturbations with sufficient\nsensitivity to infer large-scale ionospheric FAC. Waters et\nal. (2001) combined the cross-track perturbations measured\nby all satellites using a spherical harmonic fit, and then Am-\npere\u2019s law was used to obtain the global-scale distribution of\nFAC. The low sampling rate of the Iridium magnetometers\nmean that the magnetometer perturbations are aliased at res-\nolutions less than \u223c4\u25e6 in latitude and the samples must be\naccumulated for \u223c1 h to construct a single global-scale map.\nFACs are well known to evolve on time scales <1 h.\nThis technique was used to calculate maps of FAC for the\npresent event. Figure 7 is a sequence of six FAC maps en-\ncompassing the interval 08:30 to 12:00 UT during which time\nTIGER observed an AWFC. The time stamp \u201c09:00 UT\u201d\nactually means the FAC current map calculated using the\navailable Iridium perturbations accumulated during 08:30\nto 09:30 UT. The results are presented as a polar plot of\nAACGM latitude versus MLT. The sign convention used is\npositive (red) for current into the ionosphere, and negative\n(blue) for current out of the ionosphere. The colour bar\nmeans that a FAC density in the range >0.3 to 0.4\u00b5A m\u22122\nis coloured orange and FAC greater than 0.4\u00b5A m\u22122 is\ncoloured red.\nAt 09:30 UT, a dusk sector Region 1 current (Iijima and\nPotemra, 1978) was strongest (<\u22120.5\u00b5A m\u22122) between\n\u223c15:00\u201323:00 MLT at \u223c\u221272\u25e6 magnetic. This FAC swept\nto lower latitude at later MLT, and its intensity peaked at\n09:30 UT. It was still relatively strong at 10:00 UT, but was\nclearly reduced in spatial extent and strength by 10:30 UT.\nThis FAC was weakest at 11:00 UT, but intensified again\nat 11:30 UT. An additional upward FAC was located at\n\u223c18 MLT and \u221281\u25e6 at 09:00 UT. It peaked in intensity at\n10:30 UT but at lower latitude and later MLT.\nThe dusk sector upward Region 1 current was flanked by a\nweaker downward Region 2 current (<0.3\u00b5A m\u22122) located\nat \u223c\u221265\u25e6. Like the Region 1 current, the Region 2 current\nalso swept to lower latitude at later MLT, and it peaked at\n09:30 UT. Thereafter it gradually decreased in intensity until\nit became very weak, <0.1\u00b5A m\u22122, and was replaced by\nregions of very weak upward current. The Region 2 current\nis thought to be related to closure of the partial RC, so the\nvariations shown in Fig. 7 may be partly related to variations\nin the RC intensity.\nThe dawn sector FACs are important, but were not co-\nincident with the radar observations. Basically, they con-\nsisted of downward Region 1 currents poleward of \u223c\u221270\u25e6\nand upward Region 2 currents equatorward of \u223c\u221270\u25e6. Like\nthe dusk sector FACs, they were strongest at 09:30 UT, de-\ncayed toward a minimum at 10:30 UT, and then resurged\nat 11:30 UT. The dawn sector FACs tended to be more\npatchy, split into two or three main regions spread in lon-\ngitude. Localised \u201chot spots\u201d of FAC occurred, for exam-\nple, <\u22120.5\u00b5A m\u22122 located at \u223c03:30 MLT and \u221264\u25e6 at\n09:30 UT.\nContours of the FAC shown in Fig. 7 will be overlaid\nin subsequent figures showing the HF radar observations.\nKeeping in mind the limited spatial and temporal resolution\nof the FAC maps, they suggest a relationship between the in-\ntensity of the dusk sector Region 2 current and the intensity\nof the AWFC.\n2.5 TIGER radar observations\nIt is accepted that SuperDARN radars measure the line-of-\nsight (LOS) component of E\u00d7B\/B2 drift in the F-region\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 59\u201376, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/\nM. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC) 67\n(Villain et al., 1985). Figure 8 illustrates the relationship be-\ntween TIGER LOS observations of an AWFC and various\nsatellite results. The radar field of view (FoV) was mapped\nto a polar plot of AACGM latitude versus MLT in the dusk-\nto-midnight sector. The coloured pixels within the FoV rep-\nresent LOS Doppler velocity (vLOS) for typical 2-min full\nscans commencing at (a) 09:30 UT and (b) 10:30 UT on 7\nApril 2001. The sign convention used for vLOS is positive\n(red) toward the radar, and negative (black) away from the\nradar.\nThe variations in TIGER vLOS are consistent with anti-\nsunward flows poleward of \u221275\u25e6, and an AWFC centred on\n\u223c\u221263\u25e6. That is, the low latitude scatter consisted of a patch\nwith approaching vLOS>360 m s\u22121 (red) on the eastern most\nbeams, and a patch with receding vLOS<\u2212280 m s\u22121 (black)\non the western most beams. The convection speeds also de-\ncreased both equatorward and poleward of the centre of the\nAWFC, and the AWFC tended to recede to higher latitude\ntoward the west. Finally, the backscatter powers (irregularity\nintensity) were weakest on beam 5 orthogonal to the flow. All\nof these characteristics are the same as reported in previous\nstudies (Parkinson et al., 2003a, 2005a).\nThe Special Sensor-Ions, Electrons, and Scintillation\n(SSIES) instruments on board the DMSP satellites provided\nmeasurements of ion drift velocity in the top side ionosphere\nat altitude 830 km. The velocity component transverse to the\nsatellite trajectory, Vy , is the most reliable component. Be-\ncause of the finite number of spacecraft and their Sun syn-\nchronous orbits, a limited number of trajectories were coin-\ncident with the radar observations per night. A DMSP F12\npass at \u223c08:52 UT is superimposed in Fig. 8a, and a F14\npass at \u223c10:30 UT and a F12 pass at \u223c10:34 UT are su-\nperimposed in part (b). The 2-D circulation is not given by\nVy measurements alone, but they are consistent with an ex-\ntended region of anti-sunward flow across the polar cap, and\nreturn sunward flow in the dusk sector. AWFCs are struc-\ntures embedded within the equatorward portion of this return\nsunward flow. For example, the narrow spike in the F12 mea-\nsurements (Fig. 8a) suggests the AWFC may have originated\nat a lower latitude at later local times.\nThe magnetic footprint of the Cluster 3 spacecraft is super-\nimposed using bold black dots. The footprints fluctuate on\na time scale of 64 s because ACE solar wind measurements\nwere used to drive the T96 model. The Cluster 3 trajec-\ntory advanced in time from later to earlier MLT (from right\nto left), reaching its lowest latitude of \u221259.4\u25e6 at 10:44 UT\n(21:40 MLT). Recall Fig. 2 showed the Cluster spacecraft tra-\nversed the northern magnetosphere after perigee. Although\nthe Cluster trajectories mapped to within the TIGER FoV,\nthey were located to the east of beam 15 at perigee. The\nAWFC was decaying and relatively weak at this time.\nThe bold \u201cnodules\u201d on the Cluster footprints at latitude\n\u223c\u221261\u25e6 represent WHISPER plasmapause locations (Ta-\nble 1).

It was not possi-\nble to estimate the plasmapause locations at earlier MLT than\nshown because the drainage plume extended beyond the FoV\nof the EUV imaging system.\nIt is clear the peak AWFC flows were located \u223c2\u25e6 pole-\nward of the plasmapause, with the equatorward edge of the\nAWFC overlapping the plasmapause.\nThe background contours represent the FAC at (a)\n09:30 UT and (b) 10:30 UT obtained using the Iridium satel-\nlite constellation (cf. Figs. 7b, d). The contours are sepa-\nrated by 0.05\u00b5A m\u22122 and they are coloured red (blue) for\ndownward (upward) FAC. The Iridium-based maps of FAC\nused 1-h accumulation intervals, whereas the individual radar\nscans took 2 min. However, the basic Region 1 and Re-\ngion 2 current morphology persisted when the Iridium per-\nturbations were analysed using a shorter accumulation time\nof only 30 min, and the AWFC was a persistent feature across\nnumerous full scans. It is reasonable to compare the basic\nlarge-scale phenomenology, but no doubt new physics will\nbe revealed by improving the spatial and temporal resolution\nof all the data sets.\nIn both full scans, the AWFC occurred close to the peak\nRegion 2 downward current of magnitude \u223c0.3\u00b5A m\u22122,\nwell equatorward of the peak Region 1 upward current. The\nlatitudinal peaks of both the AWFC and the Region 2 cur-\nrent were centred poleward of the plasmapause. However,\nthe equatorward decay of the AWFC and the Region 2 cur-\nrent overlapped the plasmapause. The plasmapause, AWFC,\nand Region 1 and 2 cu r nts all receded to higher latitude at\nearlier MLT.\nDynamic energy spectra of precipitating ions and elec-\ntrons determined using the DMSP SS J\/4 detectors (Hardy\net al., 1984) are available online. The DMSP F13 satellite\ntraversed the austral auroral oval from 20:08 to 19:00 MLT\nduring 10:03 to 10:07 UT. The corresponding spectrogram\nshowed a sharp decrease in the energetic electron precipi-\ntation equatorward of \u221265\u25e6. Newell et al. (1996) describe\nthe algorithm used to automatically identifying various au-\nroral boundaries. The b2e boundary, one interpretation of\nthe start of the plasma sheet, was located at \u221266.1\u25e6 and\n19:06 MLT. The b2i point, the point where the energy flux\nof ions above 3 keV has a maximum, was located at \u221265.2\u25e6\nand 19:00 MLT. Actually, a nose of \u223c10 keV ion precipita-\ntion extended equatorward to \u221263.6\u25e6. Clearly, the SS J\/4\nresults confirm the AWFC was located equatorward of the\nmain electron precipitation, and in a region of downward\nFAC sometimes associated with \u223c10 keV ion precipitation.\nAnn.

Pan-\nels (a) and (b) show the results for beams 0 and 15, the west-\nern and eastern most beams, respectively (cf. Fig. 8). The two\ncolour scales have been adjusted to permit direct comparison\nof the vLOS amplitudes. Nominal values of MLT above MQI\nare given beneath the UT time scale, and AACGM latitudes\nhave been superimposed. Qualitatively, the observations re-\nveal a \u201cjet-like\u201d AWFC (Parkinson et al., 2006).\nAWFCs and PJ\/SAIDs have peak occurrence in the pre-\nmidnight sector (Karlsson et al., 1998), and HF radars have\npreferred range windows for detecting ionospheric scatter\ndetermined by the magnetic field geometry and prevail-\ning propagation conditions (Parkinson et al., 2003b). The\nradar operating frequency was fixed within the band 11 400\u2013\n11 650 kHz for the duration of the experiment. The AWFC\nwas not observed within a preferred range window until\n\u223c08:35 UT, but intense AWFCs may have been synchronised\nwith Substorms 1 & 2, yet were not observed by TIGER be-\ncause they occurred too early in UT and at too low a latitude\nanyway.\nThe main feature of Fig. 9a is the channel of scat-\nter with strong receding velocity, nominally commencing\nat 08:45 UT, peaking at \u223c09:20 UT, remaining strong\n(<\u2212390 m s\u22121) until \u223c09:37 UT, and then gradually de-\ncaying until the loss of scatter at 13:16 UT. Similarly, the\nmain feature in Fig. 9b is the channel of scatter with strong\napproaching velocity, nominally commencing at 08:35 UT,\npeaking during \u223c09:00 to 09:40 UT, remaining strong\n(>390 m s\u22121) until \u223c10:45 UT, and then gradually decaying\nuntil the loss of scatter at 13:28 UT. Figure 9a shows the flow\nchannel was basically centred on \u223c\u221264\u25e6 whereas panel (b)\nshows the flow channel was centred on \u223c\u221263\u25e6. The spatial\norientation of the AWFC was toward slightly higher latitude\nat earlier MLT.\nCombined, the beam 0 and 15 observations of vLOS imply\nthe existence of a jet-like AWFC during\u223c08:35 to 13:28 UT.\nAs with earlier events (Parkinson et al., 2003a, 2005a), the\nAWFC velocities quickly grew to peak values during an in-\nterval of \u223c10 min, persisted at those values for in the order\nof 1 h, and then gradually decayed throughout the remain-\nder of the event. The vLOS values reached lower values on\nbeam 0 more quickly because this beam was more orthogo-\nnal to the AWFC. Whilst peak vLOS values were modest at\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 59\u201376, 2007\n70 M. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC)\n\u223c500 m s\u22121, they imply much stronger westward flow when\nallowing for the oblique angle between the radar beams and\nAWFC.\nFor this particular event, the equatorward limit of scatter\nwas probably limited by the prevailing HF propagation con-\nditions at 11 400\u201311 650 kHz. Hence decametre-scale irreg-\nularities and another detached flow channel may have been\ndetected by a hypothetical radar located further equatorward.\nHowever, the observed vLOS values decayed both poleward\nand equatorward of the AWFC reported here, so it was a sep-\narate flow channel.\nThe vLOS observations revealed another important aspect\nof the AWFC evolution. Figure 9 shows that commencing\nnear to 07:01 UT, and possibly earlier, a band of ionospheric\nscatter with large |vLOS| oscillated in latitude, but gener-\nally expanded equatorward, merging into the nominal start\nof the AWFC at 08:35 UT. This feature is annotated in Fig. 9\nwith \u201cBEES,\u201d a band of equatorward expanding scatter. The\nBEES was especially well defined on beam 0, but was ob-\nserved on all beams, implying the feature had a zonal extent\n>2 h. Qualitatively, the AWFC was a continuation of the\nBEES. Once formed, the centre of the AWFC continued to\nexpand equatorward for \u223c1\u25e6 during the first \u223c40 min of the\nevent.\nThe existence of a BEES and AWFC was also clear in\nsummary plots of backscatter power, or signal-to-noise ra-\ntio (SNR), and Doppler spectral width (neither shown). The\nscatter associated with the BEES and AWFC were charac-\nterised by strong SNR, 30\u201340 dB, and low spectral width,\n<60 m s\u22121. This contrasts with the scatter found further\npoleward where the SNR was predominantly <18 dB and\nthe spectral width predominantly >75 m s\u22121. This sug-\ngests the decametre-scale ionospheric irregularities associ-\nated with the BEES and AWFC were unusually intense (i.e.\nlarge \u03b4n\/n) and depending on the interpretation of the spec-\ntral widths, the irregularity coherence time was long, or the\nvelocity turbulence was weak.\nWith reference to Fig. 1, there was a \u223c126 nT surge in\nthe geomagnetic X component during 07:01 to 07:57 UT\n(Fig. 1b), and there was an increase in energetic particle flux\ndetected by LANL 1991-080 during 07:12 to 08:15 UT. The\ninterval of DPP activity, 07:58 to 08:33 UT, may have pro-\nduced fluctuations in the geomagnetic X, Y , and Z compo-\nnents (Fig. 1b), as well as oscillation in the latitude of the\nBEES (Fig. 9). However, DPP effects are normally transient\n(Thorolfsson et al., 2001), and are not considered further in\nthis study. The interpretation of the BEES amidst this com-\nplex sequence of events is an ongoing investigation.\nThe DMSP F13 satellite traversed the austral auroral oval\nfrom 21:36 to 19:36 MLT during 08:18 to 08:23 UT. The b2e\nboundary was located at\u221264.6\u25e6 and 19:54 MLT, and the b1e\nboundary was located at\u221262.7\u25e6 and 19:42 MLT. Referring to\nFigs. 9 and 10, the DMSP results suggest the BEES was ex-\npanding equatorward through the inner plasma sheet toward\nthe plasmatrough. The WHISPER VLF observations (Fig. 3)\nsuggest the separation between the auroral zone, as defined\nby auroral kilometric radiation and hiss, and the plasmapause\nwas relatively small during this event.\nFinally, the Iridium-based contours of FAC density for\n09:30 UT (Fig. 7b) have been superimposed on the two sum-\nmary plots. The contours were shifted by different amounts\nin time for the beam 0 and 15 summary plots because the\neastern most beam 15 must have observed the same spatially\nstationary features at an earlier time. Obviously, translating\na spatial pattern of FAC recorded at a fixed UT into the tem-\nporal variation observed on a fixed beam rotating in MLT\nis erroneous. However, to first order the dominate features\nin the FAC were stationary and sliding a 1-h accumulation\nwindow through the Iridium data base would produce arti-\nficial changes related to individual satellite passes entering\nand leaving the time window.\nThe Iridium results show that the BEES and AWFC were\nassociated with the apparent equatorward movement of the\nRegion 2 current, and the AWFC decayed when the Region 2\ncurrent was replaced by a weak upward current. Figure 7e\nconfirms the Region 2 current was replaced by a weak up-\nward current by \u223c11:00 UT.\n2.7 Beam-swinging analysis\nThe map potential analysis (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998)\napplies spatial and temporal median filtering to the vLOS\nvalues measured by all the radars to help achieve an ac-\ncurate representation of large-scale ionospheric convection.\nHowever, the original beam-swinging technique described by\nRuohoniemi et al. (1989) preserves more of the resolution\nof the radar measurements and is a useful tool for studying\nthe smaller scale flows implied by the Doppler shifts mea-\nsured by a single radar. Parkinson et al. (2003a) discuss how\nthe beam-swinging analysis might underestimate the flow\nspeeds, yet overestimate the flow channel width when it is\nnot L-shell aligned.\nFigure 10 represents the two-dimensional flow vectors es-\ntimated using the beam-swinging technique. Panels (a) and\n(b) plot the flow speeds and directions, respectively, against\nthe magnetic latitude of TIGER beam 4, the magnetic merid-\nian pointing beam. The time resolution is two minutes, or\none vector per full scan, and the latitude resolution is 0.4\u25e6,\ncorresponding to the 45-km range resolution. A flow vector\nwas calculated on every L shell when scatter was recorded on\nmore than five beams and solutions consistent with a cosine\nfit were obtained. The flow speeds were colour coded us-\ning steps of 80 m s\u22121, with the largest speeds (>720 m s\u22121)\nhighlighted in red. Similarly, the flow directions have been\ncolour coded using steps of 18\u25e6 where azimuth 0\u25e6 is toward\nmagnetic west.\nThe beam-swinging results have a noisy quality because\nthe analysis is influenced by short-scale velocity fluctua-\ntions. However, the results show that the flow speeds\npoleward of \u223c\u221265\u25e6 were mostly strong and toward the\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 59\u201376, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/\nM. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC) 71\nwest before\u223c09:35 UT. Thereafter they were predominantly\nmoderate, <320 m s\u22121. However, several bursts of stronger\nanti-sunward flow commenced at latitudes poleward of\u221275\u25e6\n, the first starting at \u223c09:56 UT. These flow bursts may have\nbeen the HF radar signatures of Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs)\n(Angelopoulos et al., 1992; Grocott et al., 2004).\nThe large westward flows associated with the BEES ex-\npanded equatorward from\u223c\u221269\u25e6 at 07:03 UT. Although the\nBEES oscillated in latitude, it reached \u221265\u25e6 at \u223c08:35 UT,\nand seemed to initiate the AWFC. The AWFC flows were\nespecially strong, >720 m s\u22121, within the latitude range\n\u221262\u25e6 to \u221264\u25e6 during \u223c08:46 to 09:44 UT. They decayed to\n<520 m s\u22121 after 10:42 UT, and to <160 m s\u22121 by 13:08 UT.\nIMAGE EUV plasmapause locations were identified once\nevery 10 min at the magnetic longitude of TIGER beam 4\nand were superimposed as bold, black triangles in Fig. 10.\nPlasmapause locations could not be identified at times earlier\nthan shown because the drainage plume extended beyond the\nFoV of the EUV imager; nor at later times than shown be-\ncause global-scale images were no longer available. The re-\nsults show the equatorward edges of the BEES and AWFC\nwere aligned with the plasmapause boundary as the radar\nFoV rotated in MLT. Recall from Fig. 6 that the drainage\nplume extended to greater radial distance (higher latitude) at\nearlier MLT.\nFigure 10 also demonstrates that the TIGER radar ob-\nserved a patch of ionospheric scatter which mapped to\nL shells within the outer plasmasphere. This \u201cplasmas-\npheric scatter\u201d was at the equatorward edge of the AWFC.\nApproaching magnetic midnight the plasmapause migrated\nequatorward of the region where TIGER observed F-region\nirregularities.\n3 Summary of results\nThis study reports a comprehensive set of ground-based and\nsatellite measurements to help provide insights into the re-\nlationship between the BEES, AWFC, plasmapause, and the\nRegion 1 and 2 FACs, and other phenomena. We summarise\nthe main results as follows:\n1. The TIGER SuperDARN radar observed an AWFC dur-\ning \u223c08:35 to 13:28 UT in the dusk-to-midnight sec-\ntor (\u223c19:00\u201323:00 MLT). A beam-swinging analysis\nprovided estimates of the 2-D flows (Fig. 10). The\nAWFC flows were especially strong, >720 m s\u22121, dur-\ning \u223c08:46 to 09:44 UT, and gradually decayed there-\nafter. The AWFC flows maximised in the magnetic lat-\nitude range \u221262\u25e6 to \u221264\u25e6, and were tilted slightly to-\nward the pole at earlier MLT. Considerable structure\nexisted within the AWFC, and it is likely larger veloci-\nties existed beneath the pixel size of the measurements\n(Parkinson et al., 2003a).\n2. The TIGER radar observed a BEES during \u223c07:03 to\n08:35 UT in the dusk sector (\u223c16:00\u201319:00 MLT on\nbeam 4). The BEES was associated with a strong pole-\nward directed electric field concentrated within a narrow\nspatial region of 1\u20132\u25e6 (Fig. 9), and its equatorward ex-\npansion was contiguous with the start of the AWFC. The\napparent overall equatorward movement of the BEES\nin UT was significantly faster than that of the Region 2\nFAC and the adjacent plasmapause (Fig. 10). Hence the\nequatorward movement was partly caused by the radar\nrotating in MLT about a stationary plasma trough which\nwas located at lower latitude at later MLT (Fig. 6). How-\never, the more rapid displacements in latitude must have\nbeen caused by equatorward and poleward expansions\nrelated to ongoing substorm activity and the transient\neffects of the DPP (Fig. 1).\n3. The AL index for 7 April 2001 indicates the observed\nAWFC was preceded by two large and distinct sub-\nstorms (Substorm 1 and 2; Fig. 1a). These substorms\nhad recovered prior to the AWFC. The MQI mag-\nnetometer observed a 250-nT positive deflection dur-\ning 07:01 to 07:46 UT (Fig. 1b). The BEES com-\nmenced during this local Hall current intensification,\nbut it continued beyond. The BEES was more coinci-\ndent with LANL energetic particle activity measured at\ngeosynchronous orbit. The AL index revealed the plan-\netary conditions were moderately active (\u223c\u2212200 nT)\nthroughout the lifetime of the AWFC.\n4. Cluster WHISPER-based identification of the plasma-\npause indicate it was stationary to within \u223c1\u25e6 through-\nout the lifetime of the AWFC. The WHISPER and IM-\nAGE EUV-based plasmapause locations indicate the\npeak AWFC flows were located \u223c2\u25e6 poleward of the\nplasmapause. However, the equatorward edge of the\nweaker AWFC flows overlapped the plasmapause, and\nthe TIGER radar observed ionospheric scatter on mag-\nnetic field lines which map to within the plasmasphere.\nMore case studies may confirm that the equatorward\nlimit of an AWFC defined by the equatorward edge of\nscatter combined with a velocity threshold is a reason-\nable proxy for plasmapause location.\n5. The IMAGE EUV global-scale images of the plasma-\nsphere (e.g., Fig. 6) showed that the AWFC mapped to\nthe outer edge of the drainage plume plasmapause in the\ndusk-to-midnight sector. The drainage plume plasma-\npause was located at a greater L shell and became more\ndiffuse at earlier MLT. Mapped to the ionosphere, this\nmeant the plasmapause was located at a higher magnetic\nlatitude at earlier MLT, similar to the poleward tilt of\nthe AWFC. Goldstein et al. (2002, 2003, 2005) have\ndemonstrated the importance of PJ\/SAIDs in account-\ning for plasmapause erosion.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/ Ann. Geophys., 25, 59\u201376, 2007\n72 M. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC)\n6. Flow channels can be considered SAPS-related when\nthey are located equatorward of the equatorward limit\nof significant fluxes (>106 cm\u22122 ster\u22121 s\u22121) of plasma\nsheet electrons precipitating with energy in the order\nof 1 keV or more. Online DMSP SS J\/4 observations\nof precipitating electrons (not shown) confirm that the\npeak of the AWFC was located equatorward of the in-\nner edge of the plasma sheet. However, the poleward\nside of the AWFC overlapped the equatorward edge of\nelectron precipitation, especially when the average elec-\ntron energy decreased in the Earthward direction.\n7. A DMSP F13 satellite pass during 10:03 to 10:07 UT\nrevealed a nose of \u223c10 keV ion precipitation extend-\ning equatorward to \u221263.6\u25e6. Spasojevic et al. (2004)\nreported IMAGE FUV observations of detached proton\narcs mapping to the plasmasphere drainage plume and\npossibly caused by pitch angle scattering of RC ions by\nelectromagnetic ion cyclotron waves.\n8. The Iridium-based estimates of large-scale FAC show\nthat the peak AWFC flows were collocated near to a\npeak Region 2 downward FAC in the dusk-to-midnight\nsector. The Region 1 upward FAC was located further\npoleward in the main electron auroral oval. Like the\nEUV plasmapause boundary, the peak Region 2 current\nreceded to higher latitude at earlier MLT. The finite lon-\ngitudinal extent of the Region 2 current suggests a re-\nlationship to partial RC closure. Within the 1-h time\nresolution of the FAC maps, the strength of the AWFC\n(Figs. 9 and 10) grew and decayed with the intensity\nof the afore-mentioned Region 1 and 2 currents (i.e.,\nFig. 7).\n9. Application of Ampere\u2019s law to the Cluster FGM mag-\nnetic perturbations suggest the AWFC was coincident\nwith a significant RC enhancement (Fig. 4). Moreover,\nderivatives of the FGM perturbations indicate that the\nAWFC mapped to the inner edge of intense filamen-\ntary current within the near-Earth plasma sheet (Fig. 5).\nNote that these high-altitude FACs were located above\nthe auroral acceleration region and were probably dif-\nferent to the ionospheric FAC.\n4 Outstanding issues\nIn the accepted picture for the formation and evolution of\nPJ\/SAIDs (e.g., see Anderson et al., 1993; De Keyser, 1999;\nParkinson et al., 2003a), a downward FAC enters the iono-\nsphere in the region overlapping the equatorward side of the\ntrough. Ionospheric current closure is in the form of a pole-\nward Pedersen current across the main ionospheric trough.\nCurrent then leaves the ionosphere in the form of an upward\nFAC carried by precipitating electrons somewhere in the au-\nroral region poleward of the trough. A poleward directed po-\nlarisation electric field is focussed by electrodynamic feed-\nback into the main trough because of its relatively low Ped-\nersen conductivity. The poleward electric field grows and\nsaturates non-linearly as ion neutral friction further reduces\nthe plasma density and thus Pederson conductance within the\nmain trough.\nThe AWFC studied here probably mapped to the loca-\ntion of the main ionospheric trough centred \u223c2\u25e6 poleward\nof the plasmapause. This is because of the accepted associa-\ntion, albeit complicated, between the formation of the plasma\ntrough and main ionospheric trough (Rodger and Pinnock,\n1982; Yizengaw et al. 2005). The relatively weak Hall cur-\nrents observed above MQI during the lifetime of the AWFC\n(Fig. 1b), an interval of strong ionospheric flow, suggests the\nionospheric conductivity and thus plasma density were weak\nat this time.\nSynchronicity between the intensity of the AWFC and\nthe large-scale Region 1 and 2 dusk side currents (Fig. 7)\nsuggests that the relevant current circuit was the downward\nRegion 2 FAC, the poleward Pedersen current, and the up-\nward Region 2 current. Closure via the zonal substorm cur-\nrent wedge and the meridional current system of Kamide et\nal. (1994) (see Grocott et al., 2006) may also have played a\nrole. The current circuit may also have consisted of thin FAC\nsheets located immediately equatorward and poleward of the\nAWFC, but neither the Iridium or DMSP satellite observa-\ntions revealed evidence for their existence.\nThin FAC structure might have been intense during the\ninitial \u223c10 min of an AWFC, and thereafter almost disap-\npeared because of the subsequent reduction of Pedersen con-\nductance yet intensification of polarisation field across the\ntrough. Although the DMSP magnetometer perturbations\nhad sufficient time resolution to resolve thin FAC sheets, few\ncoincident passes were available. Moreover, Iridium-based\nFAC maps were aliased at spatial scales less than 4\u25e6 in lati-\ntude, and thus thin FAC sheets separated by \u223c2\u25e6, the width\nof the AWFC, might not be resolved. Small-scale FAC struc-\nture might be identified using fortuitous DMSP conjunctions,\nor by using the proposed upgrade of the Iridium-based FAC\nanalysis to higher spatial (\u223c0.25\u25e6) and temporal (\u223c9 min)\nresolution.\nWhat is the physical interpretation of the BEES? The\navailable DMSP SS J\/4 observations suggest the BEES\nmapped to a location in the near-Earth plasma sheet. IM-\nAGE EUV data also suggests the BEES occurred deep inside\nthe magnetosphere, just poleward of the plasma trough re-\ngion (Fig. 10). The equatorward boundary of HF backscat-\nter is known to expand equatorward during the growth phase\nof substorms (Yeoman et al., 1999), and the TIGER radar\nhas frequently observed equatorward expansions of the HF\nbackscatter during substorm growth and expansion phases\n(Parkinson et al., 2005b). However, the BEES consisted of\na thin tendril of enhanced backscatter and poleward electric\nfield contiguous with the AWFC. The characteristics of the\nBEES were more alike those of an AWFC, than the familiar\nAnn. Geophys., 25, 59\u201376, 2007 www.ann-geophys.net\/25\/59\/2007\/\nM. L. Parkinson et al.: Auroral westward flow channel (AWFC) 73\ngrowth phase signature observed in other events. Without\ncorroborating evidence, we cannot conclude the BEES was a\ngrowth phase signature unrelated to AWFC formation.\nParkinson et al. (2002) reported TIGER observations of\nequatorward expanding regions of enhanced Doppler veloc-\nity which decayed across the HF radar spectral width bound-\nary. These features were interpreted as the signatures of mag-\nnetic reconnection across the open-closed magnetic field line\nboundary. The corresponding 2-D flow vectors were pre-\ndominantly equatorward and eastward in the midnight sec-\ntor. Like the equatorward expanding regions of enhanced\nDoppler velocity shown in Fig. 10 of this paper, they may\nhave been the ionospheric signatures of episodic BBFs (An-\ngelopoulos et al., 1992; Grocott et al. 2004).\nFigure 7b of Parkinson et al. (2005a) showed a succes-\nsion of BEES-like features expanding equatorward into the\nregion of an AWFC in the pre-midnight sector. These fea-\ntures represent the equatorward expansion of enhanced pole-\nward electric field through the inner plasma sheet. They may\nalso have been related to BBFs, but their continuity with the\nAWFC suggests another aspect of their evolution. The BEES\nreported in this paper was observed in the dusk sector, and its\ncontinuity in time and latitude is inconsistent with our under-\nstanding of magnetic reconnection. It seems reasonable to\nconjecture the BEES represents some unexplained process\nfeeding the AWFC region.\nParkinson et al. (2003a, 2005a) reported AWFCs that were\nsynchronised with distinct substorms, yet the present AWFC\nwas observed during \u223c08:35 to 13:28 UT, well after Sub-\nstorms 1 and 2. Although the AL index showed sustained\nmoderate activity (\u223c\u2212200 nT) throughout the lifetime of the\nAWFC, the MQI magnetometer did not reveal evidence for\na distinct intensification or substorm synchronised with the\nAWFC. In this respect, the present AWFC may have been\ndifferent to the previously reported events. There is a possi-\nbility that AWFCs will be observed during geomagnetic quiet\nconditions.\nDevelopment of the RC and FAC, and any other condi-\ntions required for the generation of an AWFC, may have\nbeen established during the preceding substorms. Although\nthe global substorm cycle lasts 1\u20132 h, the resulting energi-\nsation of the radiation belt and RC persists on longer time\nscales, as confirmed by subsequent evolution of the Dst in-\ndex (Fig. 1a). Figure 1b also shows the LANL satellites de-\ntected an extended interval of energetic particle flux activity\nimmediately preceding the AWFC. There is a possibility the\nAWFC development was related to prior magnetospheric ac-\ntivity.\nThe results of this study indicate that our understanding of\nthe inter-relationship between AWFCs and the zoo of night-\nside phenomena and their ultimate role in cross-scale cou-\npling is far from complete. The present results show that\nBEES are long-lived and spatially localised electric field en-\nhancements occurring within the dusk sector of the near-\nEarth plasma sheet, and they are related in some way to\nAWFC dynamics. The correct physical interpretation of\nBEES will require analysis of new data sets with better con-\ntinuity and resolution in time and space. Clearly, the devel-\nopment and evolution of the BEES and an AWFC needs to be\nmodelled in the context of radiation belt, RC, and FAC devel-\nopment driven by substorm current disruption, reconnection,\nand particle injection.\nAcknowledgements.
