An experimental test-rig was designed such that defects of varying\nsizes could be seeded onto the outer and inner races of a test bearing. The aim of this\ninvestigation was to correlate defect size with specific AE parameters and to ascertain\nthe relationship between the duration of AE transient bursts associated with seeded\ndefects to the actual geometric size of the defect. In addition, the use of AE to detect\ninner race defects was explored particularly as this known to be fraught with\ndifficulty. It is concluded that the geometric defect size of outer race defects can be\ndetermined from the AE waveform.\nKeywords: Acoustic emissions, bearing defect size, bearing fault diagnosis, condition\nmonitoring.\n1. Introduction\nAcoustic emissions (AE) are defined as the range of phenomena that results in\nstructure-borne propagating waves being generated by the rapid release of energy\nfrom localised sources within and\/or, on the surface of a material. In this particular\ninvestigation, AE\u2019s are defined as the transient elastic waves generated by the\ninteraction of two surfaces in relative motion. The interaction of surface asperities and\nimpingement of the bearing rollers over a seeded defect will generate AE\u2019s. Due to\nthe high frequency content of the AE signatures typical mechanical noise (less than 20\nkHz) is eliminated. A comprehensive review of the application of the AE technology\nfor bearing monitoring was presented by Mba et al [1] where it was shown that the\nAE technology offered earlier fault identification than vibration analysis, particularly\nfor outer race defects; this was not mirrored for inner race defect identification.\nShiroishi et al [2] noted difficulties in identifying inner race defects with AE stating\nthat emissions from inner race defects were not of sufficient strength\/energy to be\ndetectable above the operational background noise. Shiroishi postulated reasons for\nthis stating that AE signals generated by an inner race defect had to travel further and\nthrough more interfaces than those for any other type of defect (e.g., the outer race).\nAlso, it was commented that the signal strength may diminish if the transmission path\nfor the AE wave was not direct to the sensor; implying that the transmission path will\nbe influenced by the position of the defect, the roller, and the sensor. This observation\nwas also recently presented by Tan [3] et al where the viability of the AE technology\nfor gear defect detection by making observations from non-rotating components\n(bearing casings) of a machine was called into question. Several other authors have\nshown the advantages of applying AE to monitoring of rolling element bearings [4 \u2013\n17].\nThe aim of this paper is to ascertain the applicability of AE for detecting the presence\nof inner and outer race defects, particularly as the former has been reported to be\nfraught with difficulty. Furthermore, the paper builds on the investigation of Al-\nGhamdi [18, 19] by exploring further the relationship between time-domain AE\nwaveform characteristics with seeded defect geometric dimensions of the inner and\nouter race.\n2. Experimental apparatus and data acquisition\nThe test bearing was fitted on a rig which consisted of a shaft that was driven by a\nmotor. The shaft was supported by two large slave bearings, see figure 1. The test\nbearing was a split Cooper cylindrical roller type 01B40MEX, with a bore diameter of\n40 mm, external diameter of 84mm, pitch circle diameter of 68mm, roller diameter of\n12mm, and 10 rollers in total. This bearing was selected due to its split design which\nwould facilitate the assembling and disassembling of the bearing on the shaft after\neach test.\nThe AE acquisition system consisted of a piezoelectric type sensor (Physical Acoustic\nCorporation type WD) fitted onto the top half of the bearing housing. The transducer\nhad an operating frequency of 100 to 1000 kHz. The signal from the transducer was\namplified at 40dB and sampled at 8MHz for outer race experiments, and, 4 MHz and\n8MHz for the inner race experiments at 1500rpm and 3000rpm respectively.\nFigure 1 Layout of experimental test-rig\n3 Experimental Procedure\nFour split Cooper bearings were used for the experiment in order to seed a variety of\ndefects on each bearing. The defects on the bearing elements were made by using an\nelectric engraver with a carbide tip. In an attempt to understand how the defect size\ninfluenced AE waveform an incremental procedure for simulating increasing defect\nsizes was established. This involved starting a sequence on a bearing with a point\ndefect (D1) and increasing the length along the circumferential direction to a\nmaximum value for a fixed width across the race. Once this maximum length was\nachieved the width of the defect was then expanded. A breakdown on the incremental\nHydraulic Ram\nTest Bearing\ndefect procedure is detailed in tables 1(a) to 1(d). In all tests the smallest defect\nseeded had a diameter of 0.5mm which was labelled \u2018D1\u2019. The defect sizes were\nmeasured by its Length (mm) and Width (mm), where the length was measured\ncircumferentially in the direction of the rollers and the width is defined as the distance\nacross the bearing race.\nTable ( 1a ) Bearing-1 incremental Table ( 1b ) Bearing-2 incremental\ndefect sizes (outer race) defect sizes (outer race)\nBearing 1 (L X W) mm Bearing 2 (L X W) mm\nD1 Circle D= 0.5mm D10 1x2\nD2 0.9x2.5 mm D11 2x2\nD3 0.9x4 D12 4x2\nD4 0.9x8 D13 8x2\nD5 0.9x12 D14 12x2\nD6 3x12 D15 12x6\nD7 5x12 D16 12x9\nD8 7x12\nD9 9x12\nTable ( 1c ) Bearing-3 incremental Table ( 1d ) Bearing-4 incremental\ndefect sizes (inner race) defect sizes (inner race)\nBearing 3 (L X W) mm Bearing 4 (L X W) mm\nD17 Circle D= 0.5mm D23 1x3\nD18 3x1 D24 1x6\nD19 6x1 D25 1x12\nD20 12x1 D26 3x12\nD21 12x3 D27 6 x12\nD22 12x6\nFigure 2 A sample of an inner race defect\nExperimental tests were performed by first making the defects in the appropriate size\nand geometrical shape, see figure 2, on the bearing element after which the bearing\nwas installed and positioned such that the defect was at the top-dead-centre where the\nload was applied. After installing the bearing, the test rig was run at the first speed of\n1500 rpm for at least fifteen minutes to bring it up to thermal equilibrium. Next,\nforces of 2.7, 5.3, and 8kN were applied in sequence and AE data was acquired for\neach load condition. The rig was shutdown and the motor changed to provide a speed\nof 3000rpm. The procedure for loading and AE data acquisition was repeated again.\nThe bearing was then dismantled and the next incremental defect was seeded onto the\nbearing element. The test sequence described above was again undertaken. A total of\n162 tests were performed for this investigation.\n4. Analysis\nFor each test performed (162 in total), 42 AE data files were acquired. The averaged\nenergy and maximum amplitude values for all 42 data files associated with each\ndefect condition are presented as a function of speed, load and defect size.\n4.1 Observations of Energy values for the outer race (Bearings 1 and 2)\nThe energy values were compared for increasing outer race defect sizes at varying\nspeed and load conditions. It was noted that energy values increased with increasing\nspeed and load. For tests involving Bearing\u2019s -1 and -2, incrementally increasing the\ndefect size resulted in an increase in energy values at both speed conditions, see\nfigures 3 and 4.\n0.00000\n0.00010\n0.00020\n0.00030\nD\n1\nD\n2\nD\n3\nD\n4\nD\n5\nD\n6\nD\n7\nD\n8\nD\n9\nD\n10\nD\n11\nD\n12\nD\n13\nD\n14\nD\n15\nD\n16\nDefect Type\nE\nn\ner\ngy\n(V\n2 s\n)\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 3 AE Energy for varying defect and load conditions; Outer race,\n1500rpm\n0.00000\n0.00020\n0.00040\n0.00060\n0.00080\n0.00100\nD\n1\nD\n2\nD\n3\nD\n4\nD\n5\nD\n6\nD\n7\nD\n8\nD\n9\nD\n10\nD\n11\nD\n12\nD\n13\nD\n14\nD\n15\nD\n16\nDefect Type\nE\nn\ner\ngy\n(V\n2 s\n)\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nBearing 1\nBearing 2\nBearing 1 Bearing 2\nFigure 4 AE Energy for varying defect and load conditions; Outer race,\n3000rpm\n4.2 Observations of Maximum Amplitude values for the Outer Race\n(Bearings 1 and 2)\nAs with the energy values, the maximum amplitude values showed a general increase\nwith defect size at both rotational speeds (1500 and 3000rpm). However, it was noted\nthat maximum amplitude values presented in figures 5 and 6 reached a maximum and\nthen decreased, for instance, observations of bearing-1 in figure 6 showed amplitude\nvalues increased from D1 to D5. By further increasing the width of defect size\nincrementally (D6 to D9), it was noted that maximum amplitude values decreased.\nThis trend was also noted for bearing-1, where the procedure of increasing defect\nsizes was reverse to Bearing-2; indicating that this observation was independent of the\ndirection in which the defect grew and rotational speed.\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nD\n1\nD\n2\nD\n3\nD\n4\nD\n5\nD\n6\nD\n7\nD\n8\nD\n9\nD\n10\nD\n11\nD\n12\nD\n13\nD\n14\nD\n15\nD\n16\nDefect Type\nM\na\nx\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(V\n)\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 5 AE maximum amplitude for varying defect and load conditions;\nouter race, 1500rpm\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\nD\n1\nD\n2\nD\n3\nD\n4\nD\n5\nD\n6\nD\n7\nD\n8\nD\n9\nD\n10\nD\n11\nD\n12\nD\n13\nD\n14\nD\n15\nD\n16\nDefect Type\nM\na\nx\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(V\n)\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 6 AE maximum amplitude for varying defect and load conditions;\nouter race, 3000rpm\nBearing 1\nBearing 2\nBearing 2\nBearing 1\n4.3 Observations of Energy values for Inner race defects (Bearings 3 and 4)\nThe AE energy values measured for inner race defects showed a general trend of\nincreasing energy values with increasing defect size, see figures 7 and 8.\n0.00000\n0.00010\n0.00020\n0.00030\n0.00040\n0.00050\nD\n17\nD\n18\nD\n19\nD\n20\nD\n21\nD\n22\nD\n23\nD\n24\nD\n25\nD\n26\nD\n27\nDefect Type\nE\nn\ner\ngy\n(V\n2 s\n)\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 7 AE Energy for varying defect and load conditions; inner race,\n1500rpm\nBearing 3\nBearing 4\n0.00000\n0.00010\n0.00020\n0.00030\n0.00040\n0.00050\n0.00060\nD\n17\nD\n18\nD\n19\nD\n20\nD\n21\nD\n22\nD\n23\nD\n24\nD\n25\nD\n26\nD\n27\nDefect Type\nE\nn\ner\ngy\n(V\n2 s\n)\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 8 AE Energy for varying defect and load conditions; Inner race,\n3000rpm\n4.4 Observations of maximum amplitude values for the inner race experiment\n(Bearings 3 and 4)\nThe AE maximum amplitude values associated with inner race seeded defects showed\nrandom characteristics.

If the defects simulated were to produce AE transient bursts, as\neach rolling element passed the defect, it was envisaged that the AE bursts would be\ndetected at a rate equivalent to the outer race and inner race defect frequencies (4.1-\ntimes and 5.8-times rotational speed respectively). This periodicity in AE transient\nwas noted for both the outer and inner race defects; see figure 11. At 3000rpm the\nnumber of revolutions captured over 32msec (time window for data acquisition, as\nshown in figure 11) was 1.6; implying that there should be approximately \u20186\u2019 and \u20189\u2019\nAE transient bursts associated with the outer and inner race defect frequencies in\nfigure 11. At the lower speed of 1500rpm, the data acquisition time window allowed\nfor 0.8 and 1.6 revolutions of the shaft for the outer and inner race defect simulations\nrespectively; implying approximately \u20184\u2019 and \u20189\u2019 AE transient bursts for each\nacquisition window. Appendix A highlights sample AE waveforms for varying speed,\nload and defect conditions. However, whilst the anticipated number of anticipated AE\ntransients bursts associated with outer race defects was consistently captured in the\ndata acquisition time window (see top plot in figure 11) the same did not always apply\nfor the inner race defects. In the latter instance there was a variation in the measured\nnumber of AE transients. This is discussed in greater detail under section 7.\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nTime (seconds)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\nTime (seconds)\nD8, 3000rpm\nD27,\n3000rpm\nFigure 11 AE transient bursts associated with outer and inner race defects\n(3000rpm)\nThe AE transient burst duration associated with specific defects was obtained by\ncalculating the duration from the point at which the AE response was higher than the\nunderlying background noise level to the point at which it returned to the underlying\nnoise level. This simply implied defining the start and end of each burst and\ndetermining the duration, as shown in figure 12. The duration value presented for\neach defect condition was an average value taken from over twenty AE bursts per\ndefect size taken at random. A complete breakdown of average burst duration for\nbearings 1 and 3 at 1500 and 3000rpm, with AE waveform plots, is presented in\nappendix A. The waveform plots in appendix A present a good qualitative observation\nof the influence of changing defect size on AE waveform.\nOuter race defect, six AE bursts\nInner race defect, eight AE bursts\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\nTime (s)\nVo\nlts\nFigure 12 Example procedures for determining the AE transient burst\nduration\nIt is important to note that defect D1 was a point defect, D2 to D5 had fixed length\nwith increasing width and D6 to D9 had a fixed width with increasing length, as\ndescribed in table 1(a). For bearings-1 and -3 no AE transient bursts associated with\ndefect D1 were evident above the operational background noise levels, see appendix\nA. For defects D2 to D5 the AE burst duration associated with the defect condition\nremained relatively constant irrespective of the speed and load condition (see figures\n13 and 14), however, the duration of the AE burst associated with defects D6 to D9\nincreased with increasing defect size along the circumferential direction of the roller\n(length), see figures 13 and 14.\nBurst duration\n00.001\n0.002\n0.003\n0.004\n0.005\nD1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9\nDefect Type\nBu\nrs\ntD\nu\nra\ntio\nn\n(s)\nTheory\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 13 Burst Duration at 1500rpm; outer race defect\n0\n0.001\n0.002\n0.003\n0.004\n0.005\nD1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7 D8 D9\nDefect Type\nBu\nrs\ntD\nu\nra\ntio\nn\n(s)\nTheory\n2.7 kN\n5.3 kN\n8.0 kN\nFigure 14 Burst Duration at 3000rpm; outer race defect\nThe theoretical time duration of the roller passing over the defect was also calculated\nbased on the rotational speed of the shaft and the relative velocities of the elements\nwithin the bearing. The objective was to correlate the theoretically determined time\nduration over which the roller passed the defect to the duration of AE transient burst\nassociated with the specified defect assuming no cage slip. Comparative results of\ntheoretical and experimental values are presented in figures 13 and 14. All\nexperimental values of AE burst duration for both speed conditions were larger than\nthe calculated theoretical values by as much as 60% for specific defects associated\nwith increasing width (D1 to D5) and in the order of 22% and 37% (for 1500 rpm and\n3000 rpm respectively) for defects of increasing length; see tables 2 and 3. This\nsuggested that the measured experimental burst duration was more representative of\nthe defect size for conditions were the discrimination of the start and end of the defect\nwere more evident (D6-D9). A reason for the difference between theoretical and\nexperimental time durations is attributed to the decay characteristics of the AE\ntransient bursts. The selected end position of the AE transient is not actually the\ninstant in time when the generation of AE ceased as there is an exponential decay\nassociated with AE transient bursts. The selected end position of the AE burst\nassociated with the defect includes this decay time. To reduce the difference between\nthe theoretical and experimental results will require employing much higher sampling\nrates to aid discrimination. A couple of other factors will have contributed to this\ndifference include the tolerance of the geometric defect size and the slight variation in\nrotational speed of the motor. Observations of figures 13 and 14 also revealed that\nload had relatively no influence on the AE burst duration associated with the defect.\nTable 2 Experimental and theoretical AE burst duration at 1500rpm\n(Outer race)\nDefect Theory Burst Duration % Difference\n2.7 kN 5.3 kN 8 kN 2.7 kN 5.3 kN 8 kN\nD1 1.93E-04 0.00E+00 0.00E+00 0.00E+00\nD2 3.48E-04 7.06E-04 7.27E-04 8.44E-04 50.7% 50.7% 52.2%\nD3 3.48E-04 8.07E-04 8.00E-04 7.78E-04 56.9% 56.9% 56.5%\nD4 3.48E-04 9.24E-04 8.22E-04 8.58E-04 62.4% 62.4% 57.7%\nD5 3.48E-04 9.60E-04 8.00E-04 7.27E-04 63.8% 63.8% 56.6%\nD6 1.16E-03 1.37E-03 1.35E-03 1.39E-03 15.3% 15.3% 14.4%\nD7 1.93E-03 2.60E-03 2.29E-03 2.04E-03 25.7% 25.7% 15.8%\nD8 2.70E-03 3.66E-03 3.47E-03 2.96E-03 26.1% 26.1% 22.1%\nD9 3.48E-03 4.51E-03 3.99E-03 4.04E-03 22.9% 22.9% 12.8%\nTable 3 Experimental and theoretical AE burst duration at 3000rpm\n(Outer race)\nDefect Theory Burst Duration % Difference\n2.7 kN 5.3 kN 8 kN 2.7 kN 5.3 kN 8 kN\nD1 9.65E-05 0.00E+00 0.00E+00 0.00E+00\nD2 1.74E-04 4.00E-04 6.04E-04 4.65E-04 56.6% 71.2% 62.7%\nD3 1.74E-04 3.89E-04 5.46E-04 3.42E-04 55.3% 68.1% 49.2%\nD4 1.74E-04 5.09E-04 5.45E-04 4.44E-04 65.9% 68.1% 60.8%\nD5 1.74E-04 5.53E-04 5.38E-04 4.66E-04 68.6% 67.7% 62.7%\nD6 5.79E-04 1.79E-03 1.21E-03 1.08E-03 67.6% 52.0% 46.2%\nD7 9.65E-04 1.83E-03 1.60E-03 1.43E-03 47.3% 39.7% 32.6%\nD8 1.35E-03 2.15E-03 2.11E-03 2.12E-03 37.0% 35.9% 36.1%\nD9 1.74E-03 2.39E-03 3.00E-03 2.53E-03 27.2% 42.2% 31.4%\nThe observations of AE burst duration associated with the inner race highlighted\nvariations from theoretical estimates of up to 80% (see tables 4 and 5) for defects with\nincreasing length and in excess of 350% for defects with increasing width.

Observations of the AE\ntransient burst to noise ratio for outer race defects showed an increase with increasing\ndefect width (D1 to D5), however, it was also noted that an increase in defect length,\nfor a constant defect width (D6-D9), did not change the burst to noise ratio, see\nfigures 19, 20 and table 6. For the inner race defects the trend in burst-to-noise ratio\nnoted on the outer race was not replicated, see figures 21, 22 and table 7; the pattern\nnoted for the inner was random.

This was also noted for AE maximum amplitude values for\nouter race defects, however, this was not the case for inner race defects. The reason is\nattributed to the variation in transmission path from the AE source (inner race) to the\nAE sensor on the bearing casing. This partly supports the findings of other researchers\n[2, 3] and highlights that monitoring inner race defects by observations of AE\nmaximum amplitude from a sensor located on the bearing housing can fraught with\ndifficulty. This is further highlighted by observations of figure 23 where three data\nfiles for the same defect, speed and load condition showed quite distinct\ncharacteristics; the figure shows AE transient bursts associated with the inner race\ndefect however the rate at which the bursts occurred was not always equivalent to the\ninner race defect frequency, moreover the rates varied for the same test condition as\nshown in figure 23. This is attributed to the attenuation of the AE signatures as a\ndirect consequence of the variation in the transmission with circumferential position\nof the rolling elements within the bearing. From this investigation it would appear that\nthe AE energy values determined over a period equivalent to approximately 1.6 shaft\nrevolutions can offer an indication of increasing inner race defect severity provided an\nadequate number of samples are taken; in this instance 42 data files equivalent to just\nover 67 revolution was employed for each test condition..\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\nTime (seconds)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\nD19, 3000 rpm, load 8kN\nD19, 3000 rpm, load 8kN\nD19, 3000 rpm, load 8kN\nFigure 23 AE waveforms associated with an inner race defect (3000 rpm)\nIt was also noted, for both defect conditions, that the time duration between\nsuccessive AE transients were not always identical. For instance, figure 24 shows an\nouter race defect condition at 3000 rpm with a difference in time interval between\nsome of the successive AE bursts. This variation is attributed to slip of the cage\nassembly. This observation was also noted for inner race defects, see figure 25, where\nthe top plot shows a variation in the time duration between successive AE transients\nwhile the bottom plot of figure 25 shows the near constant time intervals between\nsuccessive AE bursts attributed to the inner race defect. These observations also offer\nan explanation why the number of AE transients did not match the theoretical defect\nfrequency. For example, the lower plot of figure 25 shows approximately 8.5 AE\ntransient burst over 32mseconds; the theoretical estimate was calculated at 9.3; this\nwould suggest a slip factor of 0.9.\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\nTime (seconds)\n0.005 msec\n0.005 msec0.0064 msec\n0.005 msec\n0.005 msec\nFigure 24 Evidence of cage slip due to the variation in time interval between\nsuccessive AE bursts (Outer race defect, 3000 rpm)\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n)\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nTime (seconds)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n(v\no\nlts\n) 0.004sec\n0.004sec\n0.006sec\n0.0024sec\n0.004sec\n0.004sec\n0.004sec0.004sec\n0.004sec\n0.004sec0.004sec0.004sec\nFigure 25 Evidence of cage slip due to the variation in time interval between\nsuccessive AE bursts (Inner race defect, 3000 rpm)\nAn increase in the outer race defect length resulted in an increase in AE transient\nburst duration associated with the particular defect. An increase in the width of the\nouter race defect resulted in an increase in ratio between the maximum amplitude of\nthe AE transient burst for the defect to the underlying operational noise levels. This\nobservation was noted for bearings -1 and -2. Appendix A details a summary of some\nof the results and presents AE waveforms, giving the reader an appreciation of the\nchanges of the AE waveform with defect size. A relationship between AE burst\nduration nor maximum amplitude to noise ratio for inner race defects was not\nestablished and this was attributed to the variation in transmission path with angular\nposition of the shaft and bearing elements. For any future investigation it is advised\nthat a trigger mechanism be employed to ensure that the acquired AE can be related to\nthe inner race defect within the load zone, ensuring a much improved transmission\npath to the receiving AE sensor. However, this highlights a limitation in actual\noperational conditions where the position of inner race defects will be unknown.\nIn conclusion, the measurement of AE energy over a duration equivalent to just over\none rotation of the shaft has been shown to offer an indication of increasing defect\nseverity for outer and inner race defects. A correlation between the geometric size of\nouter race defects and the AE bursts associated with such defects has been shown\nhowever, this does not apply to inner race defects. The relationship between defect\nsize and AE burst duration is a significant finding which in the longer term, and with\nfurther research, offers opportunities for prognosis.\n6. References\n1. D.
