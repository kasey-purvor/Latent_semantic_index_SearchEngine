It described resource allocation as a problem in the reasonable and legally accountable administration of a set of public bodies, rather than as a problem in clinical medicine, economics or moral philosophy. As such it was a very important contribution to a vexed field, and did much to clarify debates, at least in the academic field. This second edition is therefore to be warmly welcomed. The NHS has undergone an even more extensive change since the first edition was published, under the banner of modernisation. Of particular importance from the point of view of resource allocation are the arrival of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the reorganisation of healthcare commissioning around primary care trusts and, within medical science, the rise of evidence-based medicine and the arrival of new, highly expensive classes of drugs for treating chronic diseases. The approach taken by the author in the second edition is to consider the nature of resource allocation itself, then to look in detail at how resource allocation can be carried out through clinical judgement, expert guidelines, government regulation and direct democratic decision making. He then goes on to look at how the NHS is managed, considering, rightly, that the most important resource allocation decisions are taken at the mid-range level of primary care and hospital budgeting. He describes the current structure of the NHS in some detail, identifying the scope of the different powers that lie with different tiers or centres of decision making and the role these have in resource allocation. The bulk of the book is then devoted in turn to the analysis of review by the courts of administrative decisions relating to the allocation of resources, medical negligence law (whether rationing can create a case for action in negligence by causing the care offered to fall below a proper standard of care), the relationship between local decision makers and government policy, and governance and accountability processes. An important final chapter looks at the regulation of care provided under the auspices of the NHS by non-NHS providers at home and overseas. The analysis and arguments are presented with admirable clarity and should be fully accessible to non-lawyers. However the structure of the NHS changes in the near future, short of outright privatisation, this book will remain a valuable guide to the issues of policy and practice. Compared with the first edition, this edition is shorter and more focused on the guiding principles of the law and public policy in this area. The first edition was longer by about a quarter, and included chapters on complaints and professional discipline and on access to medical records (considered as means to make NHS decisions accountable to patients) as well as a more detailed treatment of the then effective \u2018\u2018internal market\u2019\u2019. There was also some discussion of the relationship of resource allocation decisions with decisions about the value of life and end-of-life care. Most of this is missing from the second edition. This makes it a more focused book and one with a longer shelf life in view of likely changes in the NHS. However, scholars would be advised to keep their first editions on their shelves, as some of the now omitted material remains of both historical and intellectual interest. The new book has gained in focus and grasp of general principles, but has lost some of the \u2018\u2018black letter\u2019\u2019 lawyer\u2019s attention to detail. Overall, this as an important and fascinating book which deserves a wide readership among students, practitioners, managers, policy makers and lawyers. No work on resource allocation can overlook it.","cites":null},{"id":37955444,"title":"Guidelines for assessing clinical competence.

The main points\nraised were perceived inequity between students who did, or did not, have prior knowledge of the station\ncontent, and the lack of honesty and professionalism of their peers. Most contributors claimed to have\nreceived, or knew of others receiving, prior knowledge, but none confessed to passing on information. No\nsignificant difference (p = 0.16) was observed in the overall mark for the OSCE on day 1 (mean 390 (SD\n37)) and day 2 (mean 397 (38)). On day 2, marks were considerably greater for four stations and\nmarkedly lower for three stations. It was not obvious why collusion should affect these station marks. A\nclear indication of the effects of collusion could only be obtained from a single subsection of an individual\nstation (pathology) where 82 students on day 2 incorrectly gave the diagnosis from day 1.\nConclusion: Marks do not provide a sound inference of student collusion in an OSCE and may mask the\naspects of professional development of students.\nH\nigher education institutions are paying increased\nattention to academic dishonesty among their stu-\ndents. Although cheating under any circumstances is a\nserious regulatory matter, its importance on courses leading\nto professional status is arguably greater. The General\nMedical Council states that doctors should be honest and\ntrustworthy; so a question mark hangs over the suitability of\nany student found guilty of cheating for entry into the\nprofession.1 Because little is known about the career\ntrajectories of students who transgress ethical codes, a link\nbetween student dishonesty and future professional lapses\ncannot be assumed, however plausible the association may\nseem. Limited evidence from self-reported data from engi-\nneering students in the US points to an association between\ncheating in high school or college and in the workplace.2\nUniversities therefore experience dilemmas when dealing\nwith instances of cheating in medical schools.\nFor obvious reasons, it is difficult to estimate the frequency\nof occurrence of clandestine behaviour such as cheating.3 On\na limited evidence base, cheating among medical students\nappears to be neither new nor confined to particular\ncultures,3\u201310 although the introduction of information tech-\nnology, cultural norms3 7 and mismatches between student\nand faculty perceptions11 have been claimed as contributory.\nIn the main, reports either describe specific incidents9 10 or\ndepend on self-reported data from questionnaire surveys that\nreflect student experience and intention.5\u20138 In some studies,\nthe frequency of observations of cheating, or intentions to\ncheat, increased with seniority, suggesting that increasing\nexperience of medical school is accompanied by the develop-\nment of more relaxed peer norms towards academic\nmisconduct.6\u20138\nIn 2000, the BMJ reported the management of a student\ncaught cheating during a clinical finals examination at a\nLondon medical school.10 Among the many responses was an\nanonymous confessional, from \u2018\u2018recent graduates\u2019\u2019 of a UK\nmedical school, describing collusion on a major scale in\nrelation to an Objective Structured Clinical Examination\n(OSCE).12 Students had gained sight of a marking sheet\n2 days before the exam and disseminated the information,\nenabling recipients to revise selectively for the OSCE. A\ngreater number of merits and distinctions were awarded that\nyear.\nThere is genuine uncertainty about whether advance notice\nof content advantages a candidate sitting a performance\nassessment. The evidence from the literature is far from clear.\nSeveral studies have examined scores when similar OSCEs\nare administered over periods varying from days to 3 months\nand have shown that overall score trends do not rise over\ntime.13\u201318 In two of these studies, accompanying self-reported\ndata confirmed that students had discussed station content\nbetween administrations of OSCEs, although the nature of\nthe interactions was not investigated.13 17 In another study, in\nwhich students were officially encouraged to discuss exam\ncontent, there was no evidence of rising scores over time.19\nContrary reports exist, however, of rising trends in overall\nmarks with successive OSCE administrations20 21 and, in a\nrepeat of their initial study,14 Colliver et al22 analysed within\nstation scores and showed that some component items did\nexhibit rising trends even when overall scores did not. In\ncases where OSCE stations have been reused over longer\nintervals of a year, the evidence supports rising scores over\ntime.23 24\nThe assumptions underlying these studies require closer\nscrutiny. Some assume that advance notice of station content\nwill advantage candidates, resulting in higher scores for them\nAbbreviation: OSCE, Objective Structured Clinical Examination\n734\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 16 January 2008 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nthan their peers. From this arises the claim that a trend for a\nrising score in a cohort reflects a potential breach of exam\nsecurity and, conversely, that finding consistent scores over\ntime indicates that no major violation of exam security has\noccurred.13 14 16\u201319 The alternative view, that advance informa-\ntion can disadvantage candidates, resulting in lower marks\nover time, is considered, but features less prominently.15 20 22\nIf information about content has the potential to either\nadvantage or disadvantage a candidate, then inferences\nrelating to trends in overall marks of the peer group to\ncollusion become unreliable. Even consistent mean marks\nover time cannot be taken to indicate that exam security has\nbeen maintained.22 Detecting breaches of test security,\nparticularly at the individual level, becomes difficult, if not\nimpossible, under these circumstances. In addition, a focus\non marks has seemingly diverted attention from the ethical\nimplications of collusion and its potential significance for the\ndevelopment of professionalism in undergraduate students.\nAIMS\nAgainst this background, we describe a critical incident that\noccurred in a UK medical school, in which student collusion\nat a third year OSCE was seen on a staff\u2013student electronic\ndiscussion board. We consider the incident to be of wider\nrelevance and interest owing to the many issues that it raises\nfor students, teachers and educational institutions, in which\nthe OSCE format is used in the assessment programme.\nWe aim to:\nN describe the incident, its management and consequences\nfor the school;\nN challenge the view that trends in overall means or station\nmarks, derived from sequential OSCE sittings, provide a\nsound basis for the presence or absence of collusion; and\nN discuss ethical issues arising out of collusion from student\nand staff perspectives.\nBecause this paper relates to events in real time, which do\nnot conform easily to the predetermined character of a\nresearch study, the following structure has been chosen:\nN a description of the incident in context;\nN a description of the staff response to the incident; and\nN an analysis of OSCE marks.\nCRITICAL INCIDENT\nOSCE implementation\nIn all, 255 third year students sat for a summative OSCE\nconsisting of 15 stations of 10 min each. The exam was\nconducted at three different sites over 2 consecutive days,\nresulting in three sittings per day at each site. Table 1\ndescribes the individual station tasks and any intended\nvariations between days 1 and 2. Marking sheets were\nstandardised and the standard for scores was set using the\nAngoff method.\nStudents taking the OSCE on day 1 were explicitly advised\nnot to pass on information about the exam to students at\nlater sittings. Steps were taken to avoid successive groups of\ncandidates talking to one another, although it was impossible\nto prevent day 1 and 2 students communicating during the\nassessment period.\nElectronic discussion board\nThe medical school runs a series of password-protected,\nelectronic discussion boards, organised by year of study,\nwhich are accessible to staff and students in the school. Less\nthan 2 h after the end of the day 2 OSCE, students initiated a\ndiscussion about collusion between day 1 and 2 students,\nwhich continued until the publication of results 12 days later.\nNearly 40 students contributed, about three quarters of\nwhom remained anonymous.\nThe main topic was the perceived lack of equity between\nthose students who had, and had not, received insider\ninformation about OSCE content. Students without insider\ninformation argued that colluding students retained an\nadvantage over the rest of their colleagues, which devalued\nthe achievements of honest students and the assessment\nprocess. There was concern that honesty was not being\nrewarded. Several posts criticised their peer\u2019s dishonesty and\nits potential effect on professionalism and future practice.\nAlthough students reported either receiving insider informa-\ntion themselves or knowing of someone who had, no one\nconfessed to conveying information. Those receiving insider\ninformation disclaimed any advantage, but others reported\nstudying relevant electronic learning resources and memoris-\ning names of drug in the interim.

Reprimanding students who had admitted receiving\nadvance information was considered, but was narrowly\nrejected on the following grounds. Firstly, no student had\nadmitted passing on information and these students were\narguably as guilty as those who received information. Also,\nstudents would probably not divulge the names of infor-\nmants. Secondly, the discussion board thread probably\nrepresented only the tip of the iceberg and the collusion\nmay have been more widespread. Further problems arose\nfrom the interpretation of electronic interaction: without\nclues of non-verbal behaviour, irony and sarcasm are difficult\nto differentiate from factual statements.\nStaff recognised that targeting the students who contrib-\nuted to the discussion would make scapegoats of a few,\nwhereas others, perhaps many more, would evade censure.\nInstead, they chose to post a response to all third year\nstudents on the electronic discussion board, dealing with\nsome of the students\u2019 misconceptions about the implementa-\ntion of the OSCE, recognising the inequity of the situation\nand promising to work towards a form of implementation\nthat reduced opportunities for collusion to uphold the honest\nstudents. It was emphasised that the policy of non-disclosure\nof exam content would continue to remain an offence under\nthe current assessment regulations.\nRESULTS ANALYSIS\nIn the light of the student discussion, we reviewed the OSCE\nmarks. The mean and SD for each day, differences in means\n(day 22day 1) and the 95% confidence interval for the\ndifference were calculated for the overall mark and the marks\nfor each station (table 2). The day 1 and 2 marks were\ncompared using the two sample t test (SPSS V.13). Although\nmultiple comparisons were carried out, a Bonferroni correc-\ntion was considered to be inappropriate because of the lack of\nindependence of the overall mark and the station marks.\nCaution is therefore required when interpreting the reported\np values.\nThe small increase in the mean overall mark between days\n1 and 2 was not significant at the 0.05 level. For individual\nstations, roughly half showed significant differences between\nthe average marks on the two days. It was impossible to\nattribute these findings to collusion, however, because other\ninfluences contributed to the average station mark. These\nincluded variations in examiners, student ability and case\nspecificity arising from the participation of different patients\nat different sittings.25 Secondly, analysis of the results from\nall students sitting the exam on a specific day reflects an\naverage effect for the class. If only a few students colluded\nthen the effect would be masked by the results from the large\nmajority who did not. Thirdly, collusion can affect the mark\npositively or negatively and the overall effect is diluted when\nconsidering the average values. Finally, the mark for an\nindividual station was the sum of multiple sections, each of\nwhich may have been affected in opposite ways by collusion.\nFor instance, a student may only lose or gain 2 marks out of\n40 for a specific item. Thus, analysis of the marks for\nindividual stations was not reliable for detecting or quantify-\ning collusion.\nWe therefore decided to look in detail at the marks from\nthose stations where examiners had commented sponta-\nneously, without prompting by staff inquiries, that they had\nsuspicions of collusion for their particular station\n(Communication skills, Pathology).\nCommunication skil ls\nExaminers of the Communication skills station commented\nverbally to one of the authors (GL-J) that they had noted that\nday 2 students were offering the day 1 diagnosis, despite\nchanges to the station scenario. Attempts to analyse the\ncomponent items of the Communication skills answer sheets\nwere foiled because the marks awarded for supplying the\ncorrect diagnosis were aggregated with marks for other\naspects of the student-simulated patient interaction. It was\ntherefore not possible to either support or refute the\nexaminers\u2019 assertions of collusion.\nPathology\nWe were alerted to possible collusion in the Pathology station\nby the examiners\u2019 formal feedback comments, which were\nposted on the third year website. The examiners stated that\n\u2018\u2018It seems possible that collusion was a confounding factor in\nday 2 answers to the second part of the question. The\nhistology picture changed from tuberculosis on day 1 to\nsquamous carcinoma on day 2.\u2019\u2019\nAt this station, the scenario, questions and marking\nschedule were unchanged on days 1 and 2; only the\nphotomicrograph specimen was changed (day 1 tuberculosis\nTable 2 Total and stations scores for days 1 and 2\nStation Day 1 Day 2 Mean differences (95% CI) p Value\nn 128 127\nTotal score 389.9 (36.8) 396.5 (38.3) 6.6 (22.66 to 15.9) 0.162\nStations with questions consistent between days\nGastrointestinal system 30.5 (4.4) 31.1 (4.7) 0.7 (20.4 to 1.8) 0.236\nLocomotor system 28.8 (6.8) 28.0 (6.6) 20.9 (22.5 to 0.8) 0.311\nCardiovascular system 30.4 (4.7) 28.5 (5.0) 21.8 (23.0 to 20.6) 0.003\nRespiratory system 27.8 (4.6) 29.4 (4.8) 1.6 (0.5 to 2.8) 0.006\nLocomotor system: diagnosis and management 25.6 (5.8) 29.7 (5.4) 4.1 (2.7 to 5.5) 0.000\nPharmacology 16.1 (6.0) 17.0 (6.8) 0.8 (20.8 to 2.4) 0.314\nEthics 27.8 (4.7) 27.1 (5.0) 20.7 (21.9 to 0.4) 0.220\nPractical skill 27.3 (6.1) 27.7 (6.4) 0.4 (21.2 to 1.9) 0.643\nStations with questions partially changed between days\nCommunication skills 29.1 (5.4) 26.7 (5.5) 22.4 (23.8 to 21.01) 0.001\nResuscitation 30.0 (5.3) 32.0 (4.4) 2.0 (0.7 to 3.2) 0.002\nStations with questions changed between days\nPathology 26.4 (6.4) 24.5 (5.3) 21.9 (23.4 to 20.5) 0.010\nAnatomy 19.7 (4.5) 24.0 (4.4) 4.3 (3.2 to 5.4) 0.000\nMicrobiology 19.6 (6.9) 20.8 (6.5) 1.1 (20.5 to 2.8) 0.179\nECG 26.4 (7.5) 26.2 (6.0) 20.2 (21.9 to 1.5) 0.820\nRadiology 24.1 (5.1) 23.6 (5.3) 20.5 (21.7 to 0.8) 0.483\nData are given as means and (SD) unless otherwise specified.\nECG, electrocardiogram.\n736 Parks, Warren, Boyd, et al\nwww.jmedethics.com\n on 16 January 2008 jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nand day 2 squamous carcinoma). The number of correct and\nincorrect answers for the diagnosis given each day was\ncounted, the results of which are summarised in fig 1. The\nfindings are congruent with collusion between day 1 and day\n2 students.\nDISCUSSION\nThese findings challenge the view that trends in overall mean\nor station marks, derived from sequential OSCE sittings,\nprovide a sound assumption for the presence or absence of\ncollusion. Instead, they support the later work of Colliver et\nal22 in showing the need to examine specific station\ncomponent items, when searching for breaches of test\nsecurity. The incident also supports the contention that\ncollusion has the power to disadvantage rather than to\nbenefit students who indulge in collusion.15 20 The two\npremises, that overall marks are insufficiently sensitive as\nindicators of collusion, and the uncertain effect of advance\nnotice on marks, go some way in explaining the variations in\nprevious studies.\nSome may criticise our conclusions on the grounds that the\nPathology question preferentially tested knowledge rather\nthan skills, as knowledge is easier to reproduce at short\nnotice. There is some truth in this, but it is only partial.\nAlthough the OSCE is promoted as a skill-based assessment,\nskill must be constructed on, and integrated with, knowledge\nif it is to be of value in educating the safe, competent\nprofessional. Representing skills and knowledge as entirely\ndifferent entities is unhelpful when, in reality, the relation-\nship is far more complex. Furthermore, the anecdotal\nevidence from the Communication skills examiners shows\nhow a station, perceived primarily as a skills test, is not\nimmune to collusion.\nIt is reassuring that the marks awarded for the specific\nitems are small and, standing alone, would have little effect\non the outcome. It is, however, possible for multiple small\nbreaches to have a cumulative effect for an individual\nstudent, which would probably go undetected. From the\nperspectives of the staff and honest students, there is comfort\nin knowing that malpractice was apparently not rewarded in\nthis case. Yet, the incident threw up difficult issues for staff\nin handling the public, yet anonymous, electronic report and\nin protecting honest students. This is probably not an isolated\ncase. When this incident was reported at a recent interna-\ntional conference in medical education, many members of\nthe audience from around the world related similar experi-\nences.\nWe describe below amendments to the OSCE aimed at\nreducing opportunities for collusion but, in reality, it will be\nimpossible to block the flow of information, particularly\nelectronic texting and emails. Trusting students will always\nbe necessary when OSCEs are repeated day after day.\nAlthough plagiarism can be detected by software, detection\nof collusion in performance examinations presents an\naltogether more difficult problem. The deliberate inclusion\nof questions designed to test the possibility of collusion is one\noption for consideration. Colliver et al22 follow a similar\nstrategy in suggesting an examination of working diagnosis\nscores in the context of a simulated-patient examination in\nthe US.\nSteps have since been taken to modify the OSCE format to\nreduce opportunities for collusion. The OSCE is now divided\ninto two halves, each one being administered on one day\nonly. One half consists of clinically based stations, involving\ninteraction with simulated and real patients; the other is\ndelivered via computer and includes questions on patient\nmanagement, data handling and analysis, and interpretation\nof investigations. Although this will not exclude the\npossibility of collusion, it will reduce the opportunities for it.\nFor institutions, the more difficult problem is upholding\nhonesty and protecting students who do not cheat, for they\ncan feel disregarded by the system. From this incident and\nother reports, it seems that students are concerned about\ncollusion and cheating, but may lack opportunities to voice\ntheir opinions.10 12 Possibly, the anonymous protection\nafforded by the discussion board may have encouraged\nstudents to speak out in this instance. To discourage\ncheating, Glick3 proposes that schools carefully articulate\ntheir expectations of students and take positive, public steps\nto encourage a culture in which unethical behaviour simply\nbecomes unacceptable. Otherwise, there is the danger that\nturning a blind eye, however unintentional, may encourage\nthe growth of undesirable norms in which peer group loyalty\novertakes professional ethics. It is in this spirit that we report\nthe incident, to publicise the uncertain effects of collusion in\nrelation to OSCEs and to open a debate about these issues in\nrelation to current OSCE implementation practices.\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough research examining the effects of collusion on\nOSCE marks has been conducted, there is little information\nabout the nature of collusion and its ethical implications. An\nincident of collusion at a UK school showed that it could\ndisadvantage students, although its effect on marks appeared\nto be limited. Honest students raised ethical concerns about\ncheating colleagues and the possible effect on their future\nprofessional practice. In the absence of any evidence against\nindividual students, the school issued a public statement\nand has since modified the implementation of the OSCE to\nreduce opportunities for cheating. The potential influence of\nthese issues on the development of social and cultural\nnorms in medical school culture has been considered. In view\nof the global popularity of the OSCE format for assessing\nprofessional competence, these findings may have wider\nrelevance.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Mr Robert Lee of the Medical Statistics Unit, University of\nEdinburgh, UK, for advice on the statistics applied to the data given\nin table 2.\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf s\ntu\nde\nnt\ns\n\"TB\"\ncorrect\n\"TB\"\nincorrect\nOther\nincorrect\nNot\navailable\n\"Ca\"\ncorrectincorrect\nDay 1 Day 2\nFigure 1 Number of correct or incorrect answers for diagnosis given at\nthe Pathology station on days 1 and 2.

It described resource allocation as a\nproblem in the reasonable and legally accoun-\ntable administration of a set of public bodies,\nrather than as a problem in clinical medicine,\neconomics or moral philosophy. As such it was\na very important contribution to a vexed field,\nand did much to clarify debates, at least in the\nacademic field.\nThis second edition is therefore to be warmly\nwelcomed. The NHS has undergone an even\nmore extensive change since the first edition\nwas published, under the banner of moder-\nnisation. Of particular importance from the\npoint of view of resource allocation are the\narrival of the National Institute for Clinical\nExcellence, the reorganisation of healthcare\ncommissioning around primary care trusts\nand, within medical science, the rise of\nevidence-based medicine and the arrival of\nnew, highly expensive classes of drugs for\ntreating chronic diseases.\nThe approach taken by the author in the\nsecond edition is to consider the nature of\nresource allocation itself, then to look in detail\nat how resource allocation can be carried out\nthrough clinical judgement, expert guidelines,\ngovernment regulation and direct democratic\ndecision making. He then goes on to look at\nhow the NHS is managed, considering, rightly,\nthat the most important resource allocation\ndecisions are taken at the mid-range level of\nprimary care and hospital budgeting. He\ndescribes the current structure of the NHS in\nsome detail, identifying the scope of the\ndifferent powers that lie with different tiers\nor centres of decision making and the role\nthese have in resource allocation. The bulk of\nthe book is then devoted in turn to the analysis\nof review by the courts of administrative\ndecisions relating to the allocation of resources,\nmedical negligence law (whether rationing can\ncreate a case for action in negligence by\ncausing the care offered to fall below a proper\nstandard of care), the relationship between\nlocal decision makers and government policy,\nand governance and accountability processes.\nAn important final chapter looks at the\nregulation of care provided under the auspices\nof the NHS by non-NHS providers at home and\noverseas.\nThe analysis and arguments are presented\nwith admirable clarity and should be fully\naccessible to non-lawyers. However the struc-\nture of the NHS changes in the near future,\nshort of outright privatisation, this book will\nremain a valuable guide to the issues of policy\nand practice.\nCompared with the first edition, this edition\nis shorter and more focused on the guiding\nprinciples of the law and public policy in this\narea. The first edition was longer by about a\nquarter, and included chapters on complaints\nand professional discipline and on access to\nmedical records (considered as means to make\nNHS decisions accountable to patients) as well\nas a more detailed treatment of the then\neffective \u2018\u2018internal market\u2019\u2019. There was also\nsome discussion of the relationship of resource\nallocation decisions with decisions about the\nvalue of life and end-of-life care. Most of this is\nmissing from the second edition. This makes it\na more focused book and one with a longer\nshelf life in view of likely changes in the NHS.\nHowever, scholars would be advised to keep\ntheir first editions on their shelves, as some of\nthe now omitted material remains of both\nhistorical and intellectual interest. The new\nbook has gained in focus and grasp of general\nprinciples, but has lost some of the \u2018\u2018black\nletter\u2019\u2019 lawyer\u2019s attention to detail.\nOverall, this as an important and fascinating\nbook which deserves a wide readership among\nstudents, practitioners, managers, policy\nmakers and lawyers. No work on resource\nallocation can overlook it.\nR E Ashcroft\nCORRECT IONS\ndoi: 10.1136\/jme.2005.013904corr1\nAn error has occurred on page 569 in the\nOctober issue, in the paper titled Decisions at\nthe end of life: an empirical study on the\ninvolvement, legal understanding and ethical\nviews of pre registration house officers (J Med\nEthics 2006;32:567\u201370).
