Sudden increases in cosmic radio noise absorp-\ntion, known as spike events, have been identified as sig-\nnatures of substorms in the previous studies. Using data\nfrom the IRIS (Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies) at\nKilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland (L \u223c6) more than 450 night-time spike\nevents between 1994 and 2003 have been identified. Spike\nevents fall into four distinct categories based on their struc-\nture and the background magnetic activity as indicated by\na local westward electrojet (IL index) derived from the IM-\nAGE (International Monitor for Auroral Geomagnetic Ef-\nfects) magnetometer network as well as Pi2 magnetic pul-\nsations from SAMNET (The UK Sub-Auroral Magnetome-\nter Network). Classifying the types of absorption spikes al-\nlows for identification of phenomena such as multiple onsets\nand pseudobreakups from riometer data. In addition we have\nstudied the statistical variation of absorption spikes and their\nsub-classes. This includes examining the magnetic local time\n(MLT) distribution and the seasonal and solar-cycle variation\nin spike occurrence.\nThose that seem to represent substorm onsets show a de-\ncidedly different MLT variation to those isolated spikes that\nrepresent pseudobreakups. The occurrence of spikes during\ndifferent levels of geomagnetic activity is examined using the\nKp index.\nWavelet analysis has been used for studying the tempo-\nral structure of spikes; also the direction of motion of spike\nevents and localisation of spikes are presented for all events\nand each sub-class and results are compared with previous\nstudies.\nStatistical studies are supported with X-ray images of au-\nrora from PIXIE (The Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Ex-\nperiment) when available.\nKeywords.

Aminaei\n(a.aminaei@lancaster.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nAbsorption spike events have been studied since 1965 when\nthey were first described as fast onsets or \u201cF events\u201d\n(Parthasarathy and Berkey, 1965). Night-time spike events,\nwhich seem to have a close link with substorm onsets (Har-\ngreaves et al., 1997), have had their various properties iden-\ntified and studied since then. The spike event is identified as\na sudden high intensity increase in absorption followed by a\nrapid decrease within few minutes.\nOriginally they were thought to be east-west extended\nstrips of precipitation moving through riometer beams (Har-\ngreaves et al., 1979) with north-south extents of the order of\ntens of km (Nielsen and Axford, 1977). Nielsen (1980) as-\nsumed spikes were caused by enhancement in electron den-\nsity at 90-km altitude.\nLater studies have shown that spikes are actually ellipti-\ncal regions of precipitation-induced ionisation, with typical\ndimension in the order of 170\u2013190 km by 70\u201380 km.\nSuch an impulsive precipitation of electrons has been ob-\nserved during spike events using balloon measurements of\nX-rays. They occurred near the onset of substorms and were\naccompanied by westwards or northwards movement of sub-\nstorm surges (Bjordal et al., 1971). Later on, in a similar\nstudy, Pytte and Trefall (1972) observed magnetic Pi2 pul-\nsations in the auroral zone magnetometers during the occur-\nrence of impulsive precipitation and absorption spikes and\nconcluded that events correspond to a transition from dipole-\nlike field lines to significantly stretched field lines.\nSpike events are very dynamic with speed in the range\nof a few 100 m\/s to a few km\/s (Hargreaves et al., 1997).\nThe spikes, which were observed in both hemispheres, tend\nto move poleward and westeward, though examples of east-\nward motion and cases of equatorward motion have also been\nfound (Hargreaves et al., 2001).\nUsing the wavelet technique Hargreaves et al. (2001) anal-\nysed the structure of spikes during 5\u201310-min periods. For\nthose having poleward motion they found significant mod-\nulation between 16\u201367 mHz. They also reported similar\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1888 A. Aminaei et al.: Characteristics of night-time absorption spike events\nperiodicities for magnetic Pi pulsations at the correspond-\ning time and location and suggested that spike events and\nsubstorm onsets have a common source in the thin current\nsheet of the magnetotail following observations by Holter et\nal. (1996). Besides substorms, pseudobreakups are another\nmagnetic activation candidate to be associated with absorp-\ntion spikes (Spanswick et al., 2005).\nPrevious studies of pseudobreakups have distinguished\nthem from substorms via their characteristics such as short\nduration (less than 10 min) and small intensity (less than\n100 nT) (e.g. McPherron, 1991). More recently Aikio et\nal. (1999) showed that there is no definitive quantitative dis-\ntinction between the two; both occur with reconnection pro-\ncess and are associated with a substorm current wedge for-\nmation, mid latitude magnetic Pi2 pulsation and particle in-\njection mechanisms. However, pseudobreakups are identi-\nfied by their short-lived periods without significant poleward\nexpansion. Aikio et al. (1999) also indicated that pseudo-\nbreakups could be observed as isolated events as well as ac-\ncompanying substorms onsets.\nA variety of spike events occur in the dayside ionosphere.\nThese have been related to magnetic impulse events (MIEs)\n(Terkildsen et al., 2001) and are generally of much weaker\nintensity, usually of the order of 0.2\u20130.3 dB with durations of\n1\u20132 min (Stauning and Rosenberg, 1996).\nFor this study dayside spikes have been eliminated and\nonly absorption spikes that occur between 15:00\u201324:00 UT\n(\u223c17:45\u201302:45 MLT) have been considered. These events\ninclude high and sudden variations of absorption data in the\nIRIS field of view (FoV). Magnetometer data as well as\nchanges in local electrojet index (IL) have also been con-\nsidered simultaneously to address any geomagnetic features\nrelated to the structure of absorption spike events.\n2 Observations\nAbsorption spike events have been detected using data\nfrom the IRIS in Kilpisja\u00a8rvi, Finland, centred at 69.05\u25e6 N,\n20.79\u25e6 E, and L-shell \u223c6. IRIS measures auroral absorption\n(AA) via an array of 49 narrow-beams (widths between 11.2\u25e6\nand 13.9\u25e6), which produces a 2-D image of absorption in a\nlarge region of sky (\u223c220 km\u00d7220 km at 90-km altitude). In\naddition, the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS has a single widebeam riome-\nter and operates at 38.2 MHz; IRIS samples cosmic noise\nabsorption in every beam each second. AA is due to en-\nergetic particle (mostly electron) precipitation; high-energy\nelectrons (>10 keV) ionise the D and lower E region and\ncause AA. Since AA is dependent on the energy and flux of\nelectron precipitation, sudden increases in energetic electron\nfluxes at energies in the range of tens of keV are associated\nwith spike events (e.g. Pytte and Trefall, 1972).\nAnother important factor for producing night-time spike\nevents is the mechanism of acceleration of energetic parti-\ncles which happen during dipolarization of magnetic fields\nin substorm events. (e.g. Aggson et al., 1983).\nIn addition to riometer data, magnetometer data were ob-\ntained from the IMAGE station at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi for events\nthat occurred after 1998 when data were available. This\nis archived at high resolution (1-s) as part of SAMNET.\nAll three components of the magnetic field measurements\nwere examined during each event to observe variations and\nPi2 pulsations during spike events. These components are\nH, horizontal magnetic northwards, D, horizontal magnetic\neastwards, and Z, vertically downward components.\nA local AL index (IL) was derived from IMAGE data\nand was employed to match up the spike events with lo-\ncal, larger scale magnetic variations potentially connected\nwith substorm-like activity. The local AL (AU) index is\nconstructed by taking the minimum (maximum) envelope of\nthe northward components of the IMAGE magnetometer sta-\ntions. The intensity of the index depends on the magnitude of\nthe electrojets so that 1 nT changes of local indices roughly\ncorresponds to 1000 A of electrojets. There are two main\ncurrents, which occur regularly in the auroral region; east-\nward (EEJ) and westward electrojet (WEJ). Since the north-\nward magnetic field increases with EEJ and decreases with\nWEJ, EEJ and WEJ can be distinguished in ground stations\nby looking at local indices; besides the EEJ flows during the\nlocal evening whilst the WEJ is usually observed around lo-\ncal midnight. The IL index has been used to detect the sub-\nstorm phases (e.g. Tanskanen, 2002) meanwhile the precise\ntiming of substorm onsets is detected by Pi2 pulsation (e.g.\nAikio et al., 1999).\nWhen available, PIXIE images have been used to provide\naurora observations during spike events. PIXIE is an X-ray\ncamera aboard the Polar spacecraft. Images include fluxes\nup to 1.6\u00d7104 photon\/(cm2-sr-s) of X-rays (2\u201312 keV) gen-\nerated by precipitating electrons with energy from a few keV\nto more than 30 keV, which determine the intensity of ener-\ngetic precipitation when aurora occurs (Imhof et al., 1995).\n2.1 Criteria for identification of spike events\nIRIS widebeam data has been used in this study to detect\nspike events. Assuming that the spike events usually take no\nmore than 5 min (Hargreaves et al., 2001) conditions were\nset to identify events in which widebeam data (using 2-min\naverages) rose from the level of noise\/background absorp-\ntion to more than 1-dB intensity then fell down to the level\nof noise\/background absorption in three successive points.\n450 events were selected from the period of September 1994\nwhen IRIS became operational until March 2003. A mini-\nmum of 1 dB was set for spike detection in order to eliminate\nlow intensity events since they might be mixed up with max-\nimum intensity of AA patches. Absorption patches mainly\nmove with E\u00d7B drift of electrons therefore their velocity\nseems to be different from motion of spike events (Nielsen,\n1980).\nAnn.

Typical examples for 4 types of absorption spike events. Data are maximum absorption in IRIS field of view in dB and IL index in\nnT both at 10-s resolution and in 1-h interval.\nOne should note that night time spike events might not\nbe observed for a couple of nights during quiet periods and\nthere might be several per night in active conditions. IRIS\nsamples cosmic noise absorption (CNA) every second, but\nfor this study we have used 10-s averages. This matches the\nresolution of the IL index from the IMAGE chain. We used\nthe maximum absorption observed over the whole imaging\nriometer array in our analysis in the same manner conducted\nby Hargreaves et al. (2001); following event identification,\nnarrow-beam data were used to identify the direction of mo-\ntion of spikes across the IRIS field of view.\nEvents were examined within 1-h intervals to identify ab-\nsorption related to the precipitation of electrons, which had\nbeen recently injected into the inner magnetosphere from the\nmagnetotail (e.g. Baker et al., 1981). Forthwith, this shall be\nreferred to as injection absorption. Some examples contained\nmultiple spikes within the 1-h interval. Considering spike\nevents typically last few minutes 1-h duration seems to be\nlong enough to find out possible relation between events and\nreconnection activations. It should be noted that although\nsubstorm events typically last more than one hour (e.g. Tan-\nskanen, 2002) they are often a combination of many on-\nsets and breakups (Aikio et al., 1999) and each onset and\/or\nbreakup may be accompanied by a spike event. Previous\nwork by Hargreaves et al. (2001) was based on a short pe-\nriod (within a few minutes) analysis of selected spike events\n(these events are also among the 450 events we detected),\nand demonstrates the temporal properties of spikes. In this\nstudy we picked events occurring during 15:00\u201324:00 UT,\nwhich covers roughly 6 h before and 3 hours after magnetic\nlocal midnight (MLM) at \u223c21:15 UT at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi.\n2.2 Classification of spike events\nAbsorption spikes have been classified by their structure and\ntemporal position relative to injection absorption. The term\n\u201cinjection absorption\u201d is used to describe the background ab-\nsorption that appears along with absorption spikes. During\nthe substorm process energetic particles are injected from the\nmagnetotail into the inner magnetosphere and subsequently\nprecipitate to the ionosphere, hence the injection absorption\nis the result of precipitation of freshly injected electrons.\nFour basic classes of spikes are identified:\n\u2013 Individual spikes (type I)\n\u2013 Spikes followed by injection absorption (type II)\n\u2013 Spikes preceded by injection absorption (type III)\n\u2013 Spikes embedded in injection absorption (type IV)\nFigure 1a shows a typical type I spike accompanied with\nthe variation in the IL index. Type I have negligible injec-\ntion absorption. These spikes appear as a sudden increase of\nabsorption which falls off rapidly after they reach their peak.\nThus the temporal structure of type I spikes is almost sym-\nmetrical around the peak; the rise and decay time of spikes\nare of the order of a few hundred seconds.\nVariations in the IL index are short and sharp as well. The\nrecovery time of the IL index is the same as those of spikes.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 1887\u20131904, 2006\n1890 A.

These are similar to type I in that they start with a\nrapid increase of absorption and reach their peak shortly af-\nterwards. However, the decay time of type II spikes is longer\nthan their rising time, in the range of a few minutes to tens\nof minutes. The background absorption in this type decays\n(usually exponentially) from the peak of spike or some point\nlower to the zero level and might include smaller secondary\nspikes. The IL index in type II events starts with a sharp de-\ncrease from the zero level (order of minutes) to a local min-\nimum followed by a more gradual recovery. The start of IL\ndecrease occurs once spikes rise but the recovery time may\ntake longer than the decay time of spikes.\nFigure 1c shows a typical type III spike event; these start\nwith injection absorption followed by spikes. In most of the\nevents the IL index decreases gradually once injection ab-\nsorption begins and it drops with a sharp slope once the ab-\nsorption spike occurs.\nA typical event of type IV with the corresponding IL vari-\nation is shown in Fig. 1d. Here, one or multiple spikes are\nembedded in a period of injection absorption. The difference\nbetween type IV and type III is that in type IV injection ab-\nsorption is also observed after the spike. The corresponding\nIL index varies rapidly once a spike is observed. Type IV\nspikes have the longest duration of the order of tens of min-\nutes. These events can also be considered to be combinations\nof types II and III.\n3 Statistical analysis\nFollowing the criteria stated in the preceding section 87\ntype I spike events have been identified. The maximum ab-\nsorption varied between 2.2 and 12.3 dB with the mean of\n5.1 dB and standard deviation (SD) of 2.29. 12% of type I\nspikes were followed by another spike event. 157 events\nof type II were found, peaking between 1.4 and 14.9 dB\n(mean=4.6 dB and SD of 2.11). For more than 40% of these\nevents the recovery time of the IL index was longer than the\ndecay time of the absorption spike. 27 events have been iden-\ntified as type III with maximum intensity varying between\n2.2 and 8.3 dB (mean=4.3 dB and SD of 1.66). More than\n50% of type III spike events occurred with a gradually de-\ncreasing IL index following by absorption injection.\nFor type IV spikes 204 events have been identified, with\nthe maximum intensity between 1.6 and 12.6 dB and the\nmean of 3.9 dB and SD of 1.59. Summary of statistics is\nshown in Table 1. Type I has, on average, the most intense\nspikes with shortest period of the order of a few minutes and\ntype IV has, on average, the least absorption intensity with\nthe longest duration, in the order of tens of minutes.\nIn the following sections daily, seasonal and yearly varia-\ntions of spikes as well as their dependency on the Kp index\nare presented.\n3.1 Magnetic Local Time (MLT) dependency of spike\nevents\nFigure 2a shows the occurrence of spike events between\n15:00 and 24:00 UT (17:45\u201302:45 MLT); Magnetic local\nmidnight (MLM) is at \u223c21:15 UT at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (69.05\u25e6 N,\n20.79\u25e6 E, L\u223c6). Pre-midnight events dominated, peaking\n1\u20132 h before MLM. The median of the distribution is at\n20:15 UT (23:00 MLT). Taylor (1986) reported similar re-\nsults for spike events at Abisko (68.40\u25e6 N 18.90\u25e6 E, L=5.81,\nMLM=21:30 UT) during 1980-1985 with the distribution\nmedian at 20:25 UT (22:55 MLT).\nAccording to Taylor\u2019s observations only a few events hap-\npened after 24:00 UT (02:30 MLT). Similar to the distribu-\ntion of spike events, the occurrence of substorms has been\nreported as asymmetrical around MLM with pre-midnight\nsubstorm events dominating (e.g. Ge\u00b4rard et al., 2004).\nHigh absorption events which occur after 24:00 UT\n(02:45 MLT) seem to fit in the morning sector absorption\nevents rather than substorm related night-time spike events\nas our preliminary statistics show that these events have dif-\nferent structures with longer durations and lower intensities\nand sometimes with no corresponding variations of the mag-\nnetic components.\nFigure 2b shows the distribution of each separate type of\nspike in MLT. For type I events the distribution is skewed\nstrongly (43%) towards 19:00\u201321:00 UT (21:45\u201323:45 MLT)\nwith a further 30% falling between 21:00\u201323:00 UT (23:45\u2013\n01:45 MLT).\nOnly 2% of events occurred in the hour before 24:00 UT\n(02:45 MLT). Half of type II events occurred between\n19:00 UT and 21:00 UT (21:45\u201323:45 MLT) with more\neven numbers around this time span. There were few\ntype III events (27) with all but one occurring between 16:00\nand 23:00 UT (18:45\u201301:45 MLT) in which 4% of events\noccurred between 16:00\u201317:00 UT (18:45\u201319:45 MLT).\nType IV events occurred mostly later at night with the\npercentage of occurrence during 21:00\u201324:00 UT (23:45\u2013\n02:45 MLT) reaching 44%.\nAs well as the occurrence of spikes in magnetic local time\nit is also worth examining the strength of those spikes in an\nAnn.

Both high and low intensity events were observed\naround magnetic midnight and most events occurred during\n19:00\u201322:00 UT (21:45\u201300:45 MLT) with intensities varying\nlargely between 2 and 12 dB.\nOne should note whilst afternoon-evening has the highest\noccurrence of huge spike events this period has been iden-\ntified as time of minimum mean AA by previous statistical\nstudies (e.g. Kavanagh et al., 2004). This minimum in diur-\nnal absorption is thought to be caused by a reduction in wave\nparticle interactions during the afternoon sector of the mag-\nnetosphere (Kennel and Petschek, 1966). The average of AA\nthen seems not to be affected by localised absorption spikes,\nwhich last for only a few minutes.\n3.2 Seasonal and yearly variations of spike events\nSeasonal variations of spike events are illustrated in Fig. 3a.\nThe number of events has been normalised to the number\nof days when data were available. Seasons in this study are\ndefined as symmetrical around one of the equinoxes or one of\nthe solstices. Such seasonal periods have been used by Chua\net al. (2004) for studying the seasonal variation of auroral\nsubstorms.\nThe occurrence (events per day) of spike events max-\nimised during equinoxes with 20% and was minimum during\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/ Ann.

Chua et al. (2004) found similar\nresults for auroral breakups where they tend to be more in-\ntense and longer lived during dark hemisphere than those ob-\nserved in the sunlit hemisphere and concluded that more en-\nergy is deposited by electron precipitation in the dark hemi-\nsphere during a substorm.\nThe seasonal variation can be due to the variation of angle\nbetween the Earth\u2019s axis and magnetotail, which affects the\nconditions for electron precipitation. Another possible expla-\nnation is that in the absence of sunlit ionosphere, density de-\npletions lead to increased acceleration processes as described\nby Hamrin et al. (2005) when considering seasonal variation\nof discrete aurora. This indicates that the source of spike\nevents is the enhanced flux of electrons of a few to 10-s of\nkeV as opposed to 100s of keV.\nFigure 3b demonstrates the occurrence of each type of\nspike as well as seasonal variation of each type of spike.\nWhile the occurrence of spikes has a similar pattern in au-\ntumn and winter, type III spikes were not observed during\nsummer and had the maximum of occurrence during spring\n(10%). Type II spikes maximum occurrence was found to be\nin summer (44%).\nThe available (September 1994 to March 2003) data ex-\ntends from the solar minimum of 1994 across the solar max-\nimum of 2001. The median occurrence of events varies by\na little over an hour for individual years; from 19:48 UT\n(22:33 MLT) in 1995 to 20:53 UT (23:38 MLT) in 1996.\nBoth 1995 and 1996 were active years with 76 and 69 events\nand median intensities of 4.11 and 4.03 dB, respectively.\nYear 2002 also had a high median intensity of 4.08 dB, but\nthe number of events was much lower (49). The median and\nthe mean absorption for all events were 3.76 dB and 4.36 dB\n(SD \u223c2 dB), respectively.\nFigure 4a shows that the number of events and the mean of\nabsorption intensity were highest during the years closest to\nsolar minimum (1994 and 1995), which is consistent with the\npast results of studying the occurrence of substorms (Hiebert\net al., 2004).\nThis is possibly due to the tendency towards steady, high\nsolar wind velocity which emanates from coronal holes dur-\ning solar minimum; consequently the increased solar wind\nspeed leads to enhanced coupling of the solar wind energy\nto the magnetosphere. Kavanagh et al. (2004) found similar\nresults for the mean and median AA in which during 1995-\n2001 the IRIS absorption data maximised in 1995. Year\n2001, which was the solar maximum, had the minimum oc-\ncurrence of spikes with a low mean intensity of 4.0 dB.\nYearly variation of all types of spikes is shown in Fig. 4b.\nThe peak of absorption intensity for type I was during the\nyears 1996 and 2001. For type II 1995 had maximum in-\ntensity. For type III the peak was in 1997 and for type IV\nmaximum was in 1994 and minimum in 2003. Years 1994\nand 1995 had the maximum occurrence for types I, II and\nIII. Minimum occurrence was in year 2001 for type I and\nIII. For type II and IV minimum occurrence was in the years\n2002 and 2000, respectively.\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1887\u20131904, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/\nA.

Colorbars represent the occurrence of spikes during 3-hour time sectors versus 3 levels\nof Kp index.(light grey for events occurred during Kp smaller than 3, dark grey for events occurred during Kp between 3 and smaller than\n6 and black for events occurred during Kp between 6 and 9). (b) Occurrence of 4 types of spikes versus Kp index is shown with similar\ncolorbars.\n3.3 Variations of spikes versus Kp index\nKavanagh et al. (2004) demonstrated that the Kp index had\nthe maximum effect on the mean of the AA from IRIS in\nthe morning sector (\u223c09:00 MLT) and minimal effect in the\nafternoon (\u223c15:00 MLT). Here, a similar investigation has\nbeen carried out to examine what effect Kp index has on the\nvariation of spike events.\nFigure 5a shows all spike events binned by Kp index.\nMore than 90% of spike events occurred during periods\nof Kp>3 and spike events in the periods of low Kp in-\ndex (Kp\u22643) mostly occurred after 18:00 UT (20:45 MLT),\nwhich is consistent with the results of the study done by\nNielsen (1980). Significant increases in the occurrence of\nspikes were observed when the Kp index increases from 0\nto 3. For Kp>=4 the relationship is not clear. In Fig. 5b\nthe variation of each type of spike versus Kp index is il-\nlustrated. Type III events during low Kp are more numer-\nous than the other types. Between 18:00 and 24:00 UT\n(20:45\u201302:45 MLT) there were more type IV spike events\nduring high Kp (Kp>6). From 15:00 to 18:00 UT (17:45\u2013\n20:45 MLT) the percentages of types II and III during high\nKp are larger than those of type I and IV.\n3.4 Relation of spike events to the magnetic Pi2 pulsations\nVariations in magnetometer measurements have been exam-\nined for 220 events. In general the spike events were ac-\ncompanied by a sudden decrease in intensity of the H com-\nponent. For type IV spike events in which spikes were em-\nbedded in injection absorption, the H component decreased\nmore slowly whilst the D component increased with approxi-\nmately the same slope as the H component decreased. The Z\ncomponent mostly decreased during spike events. Variations\nin magnetic field intensity were of the order of a few hundred\nnano Teslas (nT) for all three components with no apparent\nlinear relationship to the intensity of the spikes in dB. Sev-\neral bipolar impulses appeared, mostly in the D and Z com-\nponents following the onset of a spike. For multiple spike\nevents sinusoidal oscillations were observed in the magnetic\nfield components.\nMore details were yielded following an analysis of Pi2\npulsations in the magnetometer data. Pi2 pulsations are ir-\nregular geomagnetic field oscillations with periods between\n40\u2013150 s (Jacobs et al., 1964); these usually occur at sub-\nstorm onsets so they are one of the more common signatures\nof substorms (Saito et al., 1976). Both magnetometers on\nspacecraft and ground stations, especially in the mid and low\nlatitudes, detect Pi2 pulsations. This suggests they are a mag-\nnetospheric phenomenon since they exist both in the inner\nmagnetosphere as well as the ionosphere (Baker et al., 1996).\nHargreaves et al. (2001) analysed riometer data and detected\nPi2 absorption pulsations as well as magnetic pulsations and\ncompared the two.\nWe used the same filter (40\u2013150 s) for magnetometer data\nas well as the IL index; the latter is used to identify the onset\nof substorms.\nPi2 pulsations were a common feature of all events. Mag-\nnetic pi2 pulsations usually occurred once absorption spikes\npeaked and then vanished as the absorption fell away. For\nsharp spikes (type I) they appeared in fewer cycles than those\nof spikes with injection absorption. The maximum peak-to-\npeak intensities mostly happened at or around spike onset\nand were around few tens of nT up to 125 nT. The time delay\nbetween two successive maximum peaks was of the order of\n70\u2013100 s corresponding to frequencies between 10\u201314 mHz\nwhich is consistent with previous ground and satellite-based\nstudies of Pi2 pulsations (e.g. Keiling et. al., 2001; Yeoman\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/ Ann.

Colorbar contours are in dB2 and the range of frequency is\nbetween 10 and 300 mHz. Data in all panels have 1-h period (x axis).\nand Orr, 1989). Magnetic data from low latitude York station\nat L=2.57 were also checked; the pi2 pulsations were similar\nto those at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (L=6).\nA Morlet wavelet was employed to study the structure of\nspike events both in the time and frequency domain across\nthe hour containing each spike as opposed to the 5\u201310 min\nanalysis carried out by Hargreaves et al. (2001). This longer\nperiod enabled the analysis of the structure of the whole ab-\nsorption event including the spike itself and any accompany-\ning absorption from absorption injection. The parameters of\nthe wavelet function that was used are presented in Eq. (1):\n1\u221a\na\nexp\n(\njk(t \u2212 b)\na\n)\nexp\n(\n\u2212\n(\nt \u2212 b\na\n)2)\n. (1)\nWhere k, a constant, equals 6, a is stepped over 30 values\ncovering frequencies of 10 mHz to 300 mHz and b is the time\nshifting. The relevance of these terms is discussed in \u201ca prac-\ntical guide to wavelet analysis\u201d (Torrence and Compo, 1998).\nResults of analysis show that for most of the events the\npeak of the power spectrum lies in the frequencies up to\n50 mHz but modulations of sharp spikes include higher fre-\nquencies up to 300 mHz. Hargreaves et al. (2001) found sig-\nnificant modulations in the frequencies between 16\u201367 mHz\nand 100\u2013200 mHz. In our analysis no discontinuities were\nobserved for those events having modulations up to 200 mHz\nand higher.\nFigure 6 shows examples of wavelet spectra for 4 types\nof spike events. Maximum power spectrum in dB2(red con-\ntours) for all types occurred in frequencies up to 50 mHz.\nFor a better comparison, the maximum power for a range of\nfrequency from 10 to 300 mHz (in 30 steps of 10 mHz) was\nderived. For each step the mean of the maximum power of\neach type of spike was normalised to the mean of the overall\nmaximum power. Figure 7 shows the dimensionless results.\nIn type I frequency components of power spectrum are nearly\nat the same level up to 40 mHz and they are reduced by 50%\nafter 60 mHz (step 6). For type II and type III the frequency\ncomponents are reduced by 50% after 40 mHz (step 4), while\nin type IV the frequency components drop quickly and they\nreduce by 50% in the second step (20 mHz). Results can be\ninterpreted with structure of spikes in the time domain. Since\ntype I has the narrowest structure in the time domain (short-\nest period) its spectra is expanded in the frequency domain.\nOn the contrary type IV has the longest period in the time\ndomain so its spectra is limited in the frequency domain.\n3.5 Direction of motion of spike events\nThe motion of X-ray aurora has been considered using the 5-\nminute resolution PIXIE images during spike events. PIXIE\nimages were available for 96 events in the period of 1996\u2013\nNovember 2002. Most PIXIE images were obtained from\nAnn.

Normalised mean of wavelet power spectrum for frequencies\nbetween 10\u2013300 mHz (10 mHz step) for 4 types of spike events.\nData bars are normalised to the mean of maximum power absorption\nand are dimensionless.\nthe apogee part of the Polar satellite\u2019s orbit and thus have a\ncoarse resolution of typically 500\u2013800 km.\nFor some events X-ray aurora emission was quite ex-\npanded covering a large area of the auroral zone and polar\ncap while in fewer events the X-rays aurora were localised.\nIn 10% of events (10 out of 96 available events) the emission\nregion expanded both westward and eastward. At least 16%\nof events had a poleward motion besides their west\/eastward\nmotions but only 5% of events recorded a southward motion.\nComparison of the maximum intensities of spikes with that\nof the X-ray emission showed no correlation, nor was there\nany major differences in the structure and development of\nthe X-ray emission that occurred for different types of spike\nevent.\nWe then followed the motion of spikes across the IRIS\nfield of view. To determine the direction of spikes we picked\nup the beam in which the highest spike occurred for each\nevent. We tracked its motion across the IRIS field of view\nboth in north\/southward and east\/westward directions. The\ndirection of spikes then yields using the position of the peak\nof spike in successive beams.\nFigure 8 shows the motion of patch of absorption in IRIS\nFoV for the spike event occurred at 1 November 1995,\n18:30\u201319:30 UT (21:15\u201322:15 MLT) in 10 s before the max-\nimum absorption happened, at the time of the occurrence\nof maximum absorption and 10 s and 20 s later on, respec-\ntively. The motion of the patch of absorption is westward\nfrom panel (1) to (3) and it is north\/westward from panel (3)\nto (4). As it can be seen the motion of patch of absorption is\ncomplicated in particular if longer period is concerned. Our\nstudies confirm that the velocity of spikes are in the range of\nfew hundreds meters per second to few kilometres per second\nas reported by Hargreaves et al. (1997).

Numbers in brack-\nets determine the location of narrow-beams (vertically and horizon-\ntally) in which maximum absorption occurred. Colorbars are in dB.\nGeographic directions are indicated in the top left corner of figure.\ntion of spikes in IRIS FoV was slightly dominated in type I.\nWe could distinguish the motion of 51 events out of 87 events\nspikes for Type I. 45% of events had a northward motion\nwhile southward motion was observed for 25% of events.\nOn the other hand westward events were 39% against east-\nward events of 31%. In type II the number of west\/northward\nspikes was almost twice as east\/southward spikes. No spe-\ncial direction was dominant for type III and IV spikes. The\nmean of maximum absorption (in dB) is slightly higher for\nwest\/north-ward spikes than those of east\/south-ward spikes\nin all types of spikes.\n3.6 Localisation of spikes\nBy considering both the IRIS FoV and the Sodankyla Geo-\nphysical Observatory (SGO) riometer chain it is possible\nto estimate the spatial coverage of spike events over a\nrange of latitudes and a somewhat limited range of longi-\ntudes. It was found that for each type of spike observed\nby IRIS, corresponding spikes were also observed in the\nSGO chain. Figure 9 illustrates two successive spikes in\nthe IRIS widebeam (red ovals). At the time that the first\nspike occurred at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (KIL, 69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E), sim-\nilar spikes were also observed at lower latitudes, down to\nOulu (OUL, 65.05\u25e6 N, 25.54\u25e6 E). The second spike event\nwas only observed at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi and Ivalo (Iva, 68.55\u25e6 N,\n27.28\u25e6 E). There is also a peak of absorption much further\npoleward at Hornsund; Svalbard (Hor, 77.00\u25e6 N, 15.60\u25e6 E)\nfor the second event but its intensity is quite low.

Black spot in the middle marks the narrow-beam in which the most intense\nspike occurred.\ncorrected geomagnetic (CGM) latitude of riometer stations\nat altitude of 90 km are given in Table 2.\nIt is also useful to note that spikes that appear in the SGO\nchain often appear to be localised in the IRIS FoV. Figure 10\nprovides an example of this; the event is recorded by the SGO\nchain between latitudes of 66.78\u25e6 N and 69.05\u25e6 N and be-\ntween longitudes of 18.90\u25e6 E and 27.28\u25e6 E. The rising time\nof spike event is the same for all stations but the peak of spike\noccurred slightly later in the lower latitudes (Fig. 10a). Al-\nthough the main event is also seen in the most of IRIS FoV,\nthe spike is only observed in a few narrow beams of IRIS\n(Fig. 10b).\nDespite the similar appearance of the 4 types of spikes in\nthe SGO chain their occurrence in the IRIS FoV was differ-\nent. While the type IV spikes had the most coverage in the\nIRIS FoV, type I and type III spikes tend to be more limited\nand appeared in fewer narrow-beams. Statistically we mea-\nsured the number of narrow-beams in which the intensity of\nspikes was more than 80% of the peak of each event.\nOn average spikes appeared in more than 10 narrow-beams\nfor type IV, 6 narrow-beams in type II and 5 and 3 narrow-\nbeams in type I and III, respectively. The beamwidth of the\nnarrow-beams varies between 11.2\u25e6 and 13.9\u25e6 and the dis-\ntance between adjacent beam centres is approximately 31 km\nat 90-km altitude.\nFigure 11 shows a typical type IV spike event in IRIS\nFoV in which a similar structure is observed in the most of\nnarrow-beams.\n3.7 Relation of spike events to the substorm development\nIn previous studies a strong link between absorption spikes\nand substorms has been identified. Hargreaves et al. (1997)\nencountered spikes as the ground-based signatures of sub-\nstorms, which occur at or near the onsets. Substorms are\ncomprised of 3 different phases which are distinguished by\nthe variation of local AL index (Tanskanen, 2002); each\nevent begins with a growth phase in which energy trans-\nfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere is increased.\nThe growth phase can be accompanied with the occurrence\nof pseudobreakups (e.g. McPherron, 1991). The most easily\ndistinguishable phase of substorm is the expansion phase in\nwhich the substorm onset occurs. In this phase the energy,\nwhich has been already stored in the magnetotail during the\ngrowth phase, is released leading to a sudden increase in the\nwestward electrojets. At the end of the expansion phase the\nAL index reaches a minimum, which is then followed by a\nrecovery to near zero during the recovery phase of the sub-\nstorm (Tanskanen, 2002).\nFigure 12a illustrates 3 phases of an ideal substorm ac-\ncording to the variation in the IL index. During the growth\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1887\u20131904, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/\nA.

(a) Phases of an ideal substorm is illustrated according to variation of IL index (After Taskanen, 2002). (b) Two spikes as signatures\nof pseudobreakup and substorm onset according to IL index variations. Event occurred in 27 September 2001 during 17:40\u201318:40 UT\n(20:25\u201321:25 MLT)\nphase the IL index decreases slightly. The start of expansion\nphase is distinguished via the sharp slope of the decrease.\nHowever it is not always easy to determine the phases of sub-\nstorms using the IL index due to the complicated nature of\nsubstorm development.\nBesides, for consecutive substorms the growth phase of a\nnew substorm is hard to identify from the signatures of extra\nintensifications during the recovery phase of the previous one\n(Tanskanen, 2002).\nAnother issue arises when attempting to distinguish sub-\nstorms from pseudobreakups since they have common fea-\ntures such as particle injections, magnetic Pi2 pulsations and\naurora (Aikio et al., 1999). In the literature the signatures\nof pseudobreakups are identified from their low magnetic in-\ntensities (<100 nT) and short duration of less than 10 min\n(McPherron, 1991). Pseudobreakups may be isolated or oc-\ncur during substorms.\nIn general absorption spikes are accompanied by a de-\ncrease in the IL index. During type I spikes the IL index de-\ncreases and recovers within a few minutes with the increase\nand decrease being of similar time-spans. For type II the re-\ncovery time is much longer (see Fig.1a).\nThe variation of the IL index during type I was small such\nthat in 60% of events the absolute variation of the IL index\nwas less than 300 nT. Although this is stronger than 100 nT\nquoted by Pulkkinen (1996), type I spikes could be the ab-\nsorption signature of pseudobreakups due to their short and\nsharp temporal structure accompanied by small absorption\ninjections and a minimum variation in IL index as well as\noccurrence of Pi2 pulsations in magnetometer data around\nthe onset of their peaks.\nIn at least 14% of events (12 out of 87 events) small type I\nspikes were observed shortly before more intense spikes. It\nis suggested that these small spikes are signatures of pseudo-\nbreakups during the growth phase of substorms as reported\nby McPherron (1991). Figure 12b gives an example of one\nsuch substorm with two successive spikes. The second spike\n(type II) is associated with the substorm onset at the start of\nthe expansion phase.\nIn 80% of type II spikes (130 out of 157 events) the peak of\nthe spike is associated with the start of the expansion phase of\na substorm as indicated by a sudden decrease in the IL index\nto values of minus a few hundred nT within a few minutes\n(Tanskanen, 2002). The IL index reaches a local minimum\nand then recovers; this may take from hundreds of seconds\nto tens of minutes.\nThe recovery phase is longer (of the order of tens of min-\nutes) for type II spikes. Pi2 pulsations in the IL index are\nobserved in these events in the expansion phase. Similar pul-\nsations are observed in the same time in the spikes and mag-\nnetic filed components.\nThe dominant west\/northward motion of type II spikes is\nconsistent with the westward electrojet and poleward mo-\ntion of auroral arc during substorms (Akasofu, 1977). The\ndirection of spikes was reported as being mostly northward\nand westward for those occurring in the northern hemisphere\n(Hargreaves et al., 2001).\nFigure 13 is an example of a type II spike. This event is\nthe largest observed spike out of the 450 events, peaking at\n14.85 dB at 10-s resolution. The spike rises from the noise\nlevel and peaks within a minute. It then decreases and is\nfollowed by injection absorption, which lasts for \u223c20 min.\nThe absorption data and corresponding IL index during the\ngrowth phase are shown in the red ovals in Figs. 13a and\n13b, respectively. The expansion phase began once the ab-\nsorption started to increase; the largest peak of pulsation ap-\npeared at 18:48:10 UT (21:33:10 MLT) in the absorption\ndata and one minute later Pi2 pulsations in the IL index\npeaked (21:34:10 MLT). The IL index reached minimum at\n18:49:40 UT (21:34:40 MLT) and started to recover with the\nappearance of the injection absorption. The IL index varied\nbetween \u2013200 and \u2013256 nT during the growth phase then fell\nto -822 nT by the end of expansion phase (within 200 s) re-\ncovering to \u2013350 nT by 19:30 UT (22:15 MLT), within one\nhour of the start of event.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/ Ann.

Red ovals indicate the variations of absorption data and IL index during the\ngrowth phase of related substorm.\nSimilar to type I, type III spikes have short durations of a\nfew minutes with small variations in the IL index such that in\nmore than 50% of type III spikes the absolute variation of the\nIL index was less than 300 nT. However as opposed to type I,\ntype III spikes are associated with injection absorption before\nthe main spike. Pi2 pulsations in type III are observed after\nthe injection and during the spikes both in the IL index and\nmagnetic field components. The injection absorption before\nthe spike in this type could be a signature of bursty bulk flows\n(BBF), appearing at the start of breakups or in the growth\nphase of substorms. BBFs are fast and narrow flows in near-\nEarth plasma sheet with azimuthal direction, lasting a few\nminutes and may happen during breakups and all 3 phases of\nsubstorms. They can appear as small-scale localised and\/or\nlarge-scale global features (Grocott et al., 2004). Duration\nof type III spikes fit with the duration of BBFs and their few\nappearances in narrow beams of IRIS and the occurrences of\nsimilar spike events at lower latitudes at the same time indi-\ncate they can have a localised nature as well as more global\nresponses. Possible connection between spike and BBF has\nalso been mentioned in the previous study by Spanswick et\nal. (2005), however this speculation requires further investi-\ngation supported with magnetospheric data. Figure 1c shows\na typical variation of the IL index during type III spike.\nFor type IV spike events the IL index displays a compli-\ncated variation. In 20% of events the peak of the absorp-\ntion spike occurred after the minimum in the IL index, which\nmeans it occurred during the recovery phase of substorms.\nPi2 pulsations are observed in the magnetic field compo-\nnents whenever spikes occur and similar pulsations occurred\nmore or less at the same time in the IL index. Type IV spikes\nare associated with the most intense substorms according to\nIL index variation and they are least localised within the IRIS\nFoV accompanied by observations of spikes in the SGO ri-\nometer chain. It is suggested that Type IV are signatures of\nmulti-stage substorms, with more than one onset.\nTo compare the intensity and timing of spikes with those\nof corresponding magnetic activation, the peak and timing\nof the absorption spike was compared with the magnitude\nand timing of the minimum of the IL index for each event\nrespectively; no linear dependence was found. Figure 14a\nshows the results of comparing the magnitudes of IL index\nfor each type of spike; the most intense spikes, type I (mean\nof peak=5.1 dB) had the smallest magnitude of the IL index\n(mean = \u2013325 nT, SD = 206 ). In the mean time the weak-\nest spikes; type IV with the mean of peak of 3.9 dB had the\nmost intense magnitude of IL index with a mean of \u2013736 nT\n(SD=349 nT).

The maximum of\nabsolute time delay between the peak of the spike and mini-\nmum IL was only 4 min for type I, which is the shortest for\nall types. This time delay is consistent with the maximum\n10-min duration of pseudobreakups suggested by McPher-\nron (1991). In type II most of spikes peaked at or before the\nminimum of the IL index and for more than 80% of events\nthe time delay was less than 15 min, which places them in the\nexpansion phase of individual substorms. In 40% of type III\nspike events, the IL index reached its minimum before the\npeak of the spike. The maximum of absolute time delay be-\ntween two parameters in type III was about 8 min. Type IV\nspikes had the maximum time delay; for more than 40% of\nevents the absolute time delay was more than 15 min. In 20%\nof events the spike peaked after the minimum in the IL index\nwithin 15 min ; therefore type IV spikes most likely appeared\nboth in the expansion and recovery phases of substorms. Sec-\nondary spikes in the recovery phase can be considered as the\nsignatures of successive substorms so type IV spikes seem to\nbe indicators of multi-onset substorms.\n4 Summary and conclusion\nComprehensive study of absorption spike events based on\nlarge amount of data (450 events during years 1994\u20132003)\nand using multiple instruments (riometer data, magnetome-\nter data and satellite X-ray images) has been performed.\nThis paper presents statistical studies of spike events and\nprovides comparison with previous studies. For the first time\nanalytical studies have been carried out for different classes\nof spikes providing insight into the nature and possible\ncause of spike events. Our statistical analysis of spike\nevents illustrates:\n\u2022 Distribution of occurrence of spike events is asymmetrical\naround MLM. Pre- midnight events are dominant so that\n40% of spikes events occurred 1-2 hours before magnetic\nlocal midnight in IRIS FoV (centred at 69.05\u25e6 N, 20.79\u25e6 E,\nL\u223c6). Results are consistent with previous study done on\nspike events by Taylor (1986) at Abisko (68.40\u25e6 N 18.90\u25e6 E,\nL=5.81) and occurrence of substorms (e.g. J.C. Ge\u00b4rard et\nal., 2004).\n\u2022 Magnetic Pi2 pulsations are common feature of events.\nThey were observed in components of magnetic field and in\nIL index when their variation is sharp and sudden, which is\nalmost the same time that spikes have a peak. The highest\ncycle of damping sinusoidal pulsations was in the range of\n10\u201314 mHz which is in the order of Pi2 pulsations of ULF\nfrequencies in the inner magnetosphere (Keiling et. al.,\n2001).\n\u2022 For those spike events in which PIXIE data were available,\nX-ray (2-12 keV) images of aurora was observed. It does\nconfirm that high energetic particles mostly electrons with\nenergy of a few keV to more than 30 keV are transferred\nfrom the magnetosphere to the ionosphere during spike\nevents. Results are consistent with previous studies (e.g.\nBjordal et al., 1971 and Pytte and Trefall, 1972).\n\u2022 The occurrence (events per day) of spike events maximised\nduring equinoxes and was minimum in summer (7 May\u2013\n6 August); the results are consistent with the seasonal\nvariation of occurrence of substorms (Hiebert et al., 2004).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 1887\u20131904, 2006\n1902 A. Aminaei et al.: Characteristics of night-time absorption spike events\n\u2022 The mean intensity of spike events was maximum during\nautumn (7 August\u20135 November) and winter (6 November\u20134\nFebruary) and it was minimum during summer. This\nmight be due to the fact that more energy is deposited by\nelectron precipitation in the dark hemisphere than the sunlit\nhemisphere (Chua et al., 2004).\n\u2022 Maximum occurrence (24%) and intensity (with mean of\n5.1 dB) of spike events were observed in 1994\u20131995 that\nis the solar minimum activity. Year 2001, which was solar\nmaximum, had the lowest occurrence (10%) of events as\nwell as low intensity (mean of 4.0 dB) of events. Results are\nconsistent with the occurrences of substorms (Heibert et al.,\n2004) and tend to be related to the high speed solar wind\nduring solar minimum.\n\u2022 More than 90% of spike events occurred in the periods\nof Kp>3 and spike events in the periods of low Kp index\n(Kp\u22643) only occurred after 17:00 UT (19:45 MLT). This\nis consistent with the results of study done by Nielsen (1980).\n\u2022 Wavelet analysis of spike events in one-hour periods at\n10-s resolution by Morlet wavelet has shown that most of\nthe wavelet power spectrum lies in the frequencies up to\n50 mHz, although for sharp spikes modulation in frequency\ncan reach up to 300 mHz.\nPrevious work on spikes in a period of 5\u201310 min using the\nMorlet wavelet specified two important modulations between\n16\u201367 mHz and 100\u2013200 mHz (Hargreaves et al., 2001). We\ndidn\u2019t observe any discontinuity of frequency modulations\nfor those lasting up to 300 mHz. This might be due to the\nlonger period of our data (1 h), which covers the injection\nabsorption.\nClassification of spikes have been performed by Span-\nswick et al. (2005) in connection with substorm onset and ex-\npansion phase, however, for the first time the temporal struc-\nture of spikes is linked with the variation of local electro-\njet data (IL index) to identify pseudobreakup and substorm\ndevelopment. Our study has identified four types of spikes\nwith following description:\n\u2013 Spikes without injection absorption (type I, Fig. 1a) had\nthe shortest duration in time in order of few minutes.\n\u2013 Spikes followed by injection absorption (type II,\nFig. 1b) normally start with sharp increase in absorp-\ntion intensity and decays in order of tens of minutes.\n\u2013 Spikes of type III (Fig. 1c) occur after injection absorp-\ntion with the duration of few minutes.\n\u2013 Type IV spikes are embedded in injection absorption\nand have the longest duration in time in order of tens\nof minutes (Fig. 1d).\nStatistical analysis have been performed on all these types\nof spikes in order to understand their relation with respect\nto the variation of IL index, MLT dependence, seasonal and\nyearly distribution, the direction of motion of spikes and their\nlocalisation. Maximum intensity in type I spikes was the\nhighest with the mean of 5.1 dB. In 60% of spikes of type I\nabsolute variation of IL index is less than 300 nT. They tend\nto be signatures of pseudobreakups according to the insignifi-\ncant amount of injection absorption and short and small vari-\nation of IL index.\nIn 80% of type II spikes the peak of spikes is associated\nwith the start of expansion phase of a substorm according to\nIL index variations. They can be considered as indicators of\nisolated substorms and their dominant west\/northward mo-\ntion in the IRIS FoV supports this assumption.\nType III spikes (27 out of 450) had the variation of IL in-\ndex with mean of minimum \u2013354 nT. They are the most local-\nized type (determined from IRIS field of view). More events\nwith supporting magnetospheric data are needed to associate\ntype III spikes with any magnetosphetic phenomenon\/ sub-\nstorm development.\nThe distribution of type IV spikes (45% of events) was\nshifted to the later hours of night as the peak was between\n20:00\u201323:00 UT (22:45\u201301:45 MLT). They are the least lo-\ncalized of the four types. Their intensity in dB was mini-\nmum among all 4 types with the mean of 3.9 dB. In the mean\ntime they were associated with the most intense variation of\nIL with the mean of minimum \u2013736 nT. Time delay between\nminimum of IL index and peak of spikes was maximum in\nthis type and their characteristics best fit with intense multi-\nonset substorms.\nAll classes of spike events have similar pattern in autumn\nand winter (Fig. 3b), however, type III spikes were not ob-\nserved during summer and had the maximum of occurrence\nduring spring (10%). Type II spikes maximum occurrence\nwas found to be in summer (44%).\nWhile years 1994 (solar minimum) and 1995 had the max-\nimum occurrence for types I, II and III, minimum occurrence\nwas in year 2001(solar maximum) for type I and III. For\ntype II and IV minimum occurrence was in the years 2002\nand 2000, respectively.\nThe percentage of spikes events which occurred after\nMLM (between 21:00 and 24:00 UT) is different for each\ntype. In type I spikes 32%, type II spikes 22%, type III spikes\n22% and in type IV spikes 44% events occurred after local\nmagnetic midnight. The highest occurrence of spike events\nis during 19:00\u201322:00 UT (21:45\u201300:45 MLT) with highest\nintensity between 2 and 12 dB.\nDespite the similar appearance of 4 types of spikes in SGO\nchain of riometers, their appearance in the IRIS FoV was\ndifferent. Type I and type III spikes tend to be more localized\nand appeared in few narrow-beams while type IV spikes had\nthe most coverage of IRIS FoV.\nIn type I and type II spikes the number of west\/northward\nevents was more than east\/southward events. No special\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 1887\u20131904, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/1887\/2006\/\nA. Aminaei et al.: Characteristics of night-time absorption spike events 1903\ndirection was dominant for type III and IV spikes. The mean\nof peak of spikes is slightly higher for west\/north-ward spikes\nthan east\/south-ward spikes in all types of spikes.\nWe eliminated the early morning high absorption events\n(events occurred after 24:00 UT \u223c02:45 MLT) as we found\ntheir duration take more than 1-h and their intensities are\nlower than those of night-time spike events besides no spe-\ncific relation between their occurrences and variations of\nmagnetic components was observed.\nFinally, based on seasonal variation of discrete aurora de-\nscribed by Hamrin et al. (2005) one may conclude that in the\nabsence of sunlit ionosphere, density depletions lead to in-\ncreased acceleration of energetic electrons consequently the\nsource of spike events is the enhanced flux of electrons of a\nfew to 10 s of keV as opposed to 100 s of keV. The next step is\nto find out the locations of source of different types of spikes\nto model each type of spikes based on its characteristics.\nAcknowledgements.
