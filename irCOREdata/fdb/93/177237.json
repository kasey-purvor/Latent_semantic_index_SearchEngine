The role of \nexecutive control processes in the translation of healthy eating \nintentions into action in young Scottish adults\nJulia L Allan*1, Marie Johnston2 and Neil Campbell3\nAddress: 1School of Psychology, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK, 2Health Services Research Unit, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK and \n3Department of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK\nEmail: Julia L Allan* - j.allan@abdn.ac.uk; Marie Johnston - m.johnston@abdn.ac.uk; Neil Campbell - n.campbell@abdn.ac.uk\n* Corresponding author    \nAbstract\nBackground: Despite the significant health benefits associated with eating healthily, diet is\nextremely difficult to change, with the majority of people who intend to eat more healthily failing\nto do so. Recent evidence has suggested that the ability to turn intentions into actions may be\nrelated to individual differences in one facet of executive control \u2013 cognitive inhibition (i.e. the\nability to inhibit irrelevant information and suppress prepotent responses). The present study\ninvestigates the role of this and other executive processes (inhibition, task switching, planning and\ncognitive flexibility) in the translation of dietary intentions into action. In addition, as the literature\nsuggests that weak executive control may be associated with hyper-responsivity to cues to action,\nthe role of executive processes in susceptibility to environmental food cues and responses to If-\nThen plans designed to cue intended behaviour are investigated.\nMethods: Future intentions about consumption of fruits and vegetables and snack foods will be\nmeasured in a sample of young adults. Actual consumption of the target foods will be recorded with\ncomputerised diaries over a subsequent 3-day period. Performance on a battery of established\nexecutive control tasks (Go-NoGo, Tower task, Verbal Fluency task and Trail-Making) will be used\nto predict the discrepancy between intended and actual dietary behaviour. In addition, executive\ncontrol scores will be used to predict reported susceptibility to environmental food cues and\nbenefit derived from the use of 'If-Then plans' designed to cue intended behaviour.\nDiscussion: Our findings will add to understanding about the role of executive control in\ntranslating intentions into actions and may demonstrate potential for future public health\ninterventions. If participants with weak executive control are found to be less likely to eat as they\nintend than those with strong executive control, then interventions that reduce the load on these\nexecutive processes may increase chances of successful intention-behaviour translation. If those\nwith weak executive control are found to be more responsive to cues to action they may also\nbenefit more from the use of If-Then plans designed to cue intended behaviour.\nPublished: 18 April 2008\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:123 doi:10.1186\/1471-2458-8-123\nReceived: 13 March 2008\nAccepted: 18 April 2008\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/123\n\u00a9 2008 Allan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/123Background\nIn common with all developed countries, the Scottish diet\nis high in fat, salt and sugar and low in fruits and vegeta-\nbles [1]. As this pattern of dietary behaviours is associated\nwith rising levels of obesity and associated chronic dis-\neases, diet is an important target for change in govern-\nment strategies aimed at improving public health [2].\nAlthough many factors aside from diet are known to con-\ntribute to rising levels of obesity, research from the United\nStates suggests that poor diet in combination with physi-\ncal inactivity is close to overtaking smoking as the leading\ncause of premature death [3].\nWhile providing the public with information about\nhealthy eating can increase intentions towards the adop-\ntion of healthier diets, it is ultimately down to the individ-\nual whether good intentions are translated into action. As\nhighlighted in the Scottish Diet Action Plan [4], the\nmajority of the Scottish public \"know what makes a\nhealthy diet and what does not\". The problem instead is\n\"the widespread failure to act on this knowledge\" (p2).\nPsychological research has established that only 30\u201340%\nof lifestyle intentions are successfully realised [5,6], leav-\ning a considerable 'intention-behaviour gap'. If factors\ndetermining the success or failure of intentions about life-\nstyle intentions can be identified, it may be possible to\nfacilitate positive behaviour change on a large scale, across\na range of key behaviours.\nOne possible determinant of successful intention-behav-\niour translation is efficient cognitive control, i.e. whether\npeople can organise and direct their thinking towards\nenacting intended behaviour. Cognitive or 'executive' con-\ntrol processes are responsible for instigating and control-\nling task-directed thoughts and behaviours, and include\nselective attention, planning, cognitive inhibition (ignor-\ning irrelevant information\/suppressing habitual\nresponses that run counter to aims), task-set reconfigura-\ntion (shifting your way of thinking to suit your aims), and\nflexibility of thought [7]. In theory, all of the aforemen-\ntioned processes are prerequisites for the successful execu-\ntion of behaviour, and consequently differences in\nexecutive strength may explain differences in ability to\nturn intentions into action. Recent evidence has shown at\nleast one executive process (cognitive inhibition) does\nindeed predict variance in diet over a 7 day period over\nand above the variance explained by an individual's inten-\ntions [8]. Importantly, those scoring poorest on the exec-\nutive test (i.e. with the weakest executive control) showed\nthe largest discrepancy between intended and actual\nbehaviour. The latter research was based on Temporal\nSelf-Regulation Theory [9], which makes the further pre-\ndiction that the likelihood of performing a behaviour is a\nfunction of both an individual's self-regulatory capacity\n(i.e. executive control), and the presence or absence of\ncues to that behaviour in the environment. That is, if cues\nto eating were present in the environment, the likelihood\nof eating would increase, but this increase would be great-\nest in those with poor executive control, as they would be\nless able than those with stronger control to inhibit task\nirrelevant information.\nIf those with weak executive control are more likely to\nbehave in response to cues, then in addition to potentially\nbeing more susceptible to advertising, they may also be\nmore likely to benefit from interventions designed to cue\nan individual into performing the target behaviour.\n'Implementation intentions' or If-Then plans [10] are\nplans which ask individuals to specify when and where\nthey intend to carry out a behaviour, and despite their\nsimplicity have been shown to increase rates of many dif-\nferent health behaviours such as breast self-examination\n[11], adherence to dietary supplement regimes [12], exer-\ncise [13] and eating more fruits and vegetables [14].\nImplementation intentions are thought to work because\nafter specifying the If-Then contingencies associated with\nbehaviour, encountering the If component (e.g. it gets to\nthe time specified in the plan), should elicit the behaviour\nrelatively automatically, without much need for effortful\nexecutive control. If this is the case, then those with weak\nexecutive control should benefit more than others from\nthe formation of implementation intentions.\nThe present project aims to expand on recent empirical\nwork [8] by looking at the role of multiple executive proc-\nesses, specifically inhibition, task-switching, cognitive\nflexibility and planning, in the ability to perform intended\nbehaviour. In addition, the prediction that those with\nweak executive control will be more likely to eat in\nresponse to external food cues than those with strong\nexecutive control will be tested, and the benefit of imple-\nmentation intentions in those with weak and strong exec-\nutive control will be compared. Finally, performance on\nthe executive control tasks will be compared to scores on\nself-report measures of executive control, the Dysexecu-\ntive Questionnaire [15] and the Cognitive Failures Ques-\ntionnaire [16], to establish for a future study which\naspects of executive control self-report measures detect.\nMethods\/Design\nAims\n(1) To establish the extent to which 4 cognitive control\nprocesses (cognitive inhibition, cognitive flexibility, plan-\nning, and task-switching) determine the success or failure\nof intentions about the consumption of fruits and vegeta-\nbles and the consumption of unhealthy 'non-core' foods\n(i.e. snacks).Page 2 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/123(2) To determine whether eating in response to external\nfood cues is more prevalent in those with weak executive\ncontrol as would be predicted by Temporal Self-Regula-\ntion Theory.\n(3) To assess whether implementation intentions are\nmore beneficial in those with weak executive control.\nDesign\nThe role of executive control factors in dietary behaviours\nwill be investigated in healthy young adults with known\nintentions about the consumption of (a) fruits and vege-\ntables and (b) unhealthy snack foods. Performance on\nfour executive tasks (each measuring a different compo-\nnent of executive control) will be used in a prospective\ndesign to predict the discrepancy between actual behav-\niour over three days and intended behaviour for the same\ntime period. In addition, executive task scores will also be\nused to predict scores on the external eating subscale of\nthe Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire which meas-\nures eating in response to environmental cues [17], and\nused to compare the beneficial effect of implementation\nintentions in those with weak and strong executive con-\ntrol. Participants will complete executive tests and ques-\ntionnaires in the laboratory setting and diary measures of\ntheir behaviour in the field.\nIt is hypothesised that scores on the executive tasks will\npredict a significant amount of the variance in the differ-\nence observed between actual and intended dietary behav-\niour, and specifically that those who score poorly on the\nexecutive tasks will show a larger discrepancy between\nintended and actual dietary behaviour than those who\nscore well. In addition, it is expected that those with weak\nexecutive control will be more likely to eat in response to\nexternal food cues, and will benefit more than those with\nstrong executive control from the formation of implemen-\ntation intentions.\nPrimary Outcomes\n(1) Magnitude of the discrepancy between intended and\nactual consumption of (a) fruits and vegetables, and (b)\nunhealthy snack foods\n(2) Score on the 'external eating' subscale of the Dutch\nEating Behaviour Questionnaire (a measure of tendency\nto eat in response to food cues)\n(3) Likelihood of performance of a simple pre-specified\ntask (accessing a website and recording requested infor-\nmation) after the use of implementation intentions.\nStudy Population\n50 University undergraduate and postgraduate students at\nthe University of Aberdeen will be sampled. This group\nwill be used because students are typically young adults\nliving away from home for the first time and as such are\njust beginning to be solely responsible for the food that\nthey buy, cook and consume. It is at this point in life that\nmany unhealthy dietary behaviours are likely to be estab-\nlished. In addition, as registered students, this group is\nlikely to available for follow-up during their time at uni-\nversity.\nInclusion and Exclusion Criteria\nParticipants must have English as their first language (to\nensure comparability of performance on the language\nbased executive tests).\nRecruitment\nParticipants will be primarily recruited through the Uni-\nversity of Aberdeen School of Psychology's online\nresearch participation system \u2013 Sona Systems. In addition,\nposters and online advertising will be displayed across the\nUniversity campus. Participants who are 1st year psychol-\nogy undergraduates will receive course credits for partici-\npation and participants who are not will be reimbursed at\nthe recommended University participation rate of \u20ac5 per\nhour. Written informed consent will be obtained at the\nfirst scheduled appointment with each participant. Con-\nsent forms will summarise what is involved in the study,\nassure participants of their right to withdraw from the\nstudy at any time without penalty or having to give a rea-\nson, and provide an explanation of how and where the\ndata they provide will be stored.\nProcedure & Materials\nThe study methodology has five distinct stages; (1) meas-\nurement of behavioural intentions and perceived control\nover behaviour, (2) completion of the executive control\ntest battery, (3) completion of the Dutch Eating Behaviour\nQuestionnaire, the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and\nthe Dysexecutive Questionnaire, (4) completion of the 3-\nday behavioural diaries, and (5) the implementation\nintention task.\n(1) Ratings of Intentions and Perceived Behavioural Control\nParticipants will come into the laboratory and fill out a\nself-report measure rating their intentions and perceived\nbehavioural control on 6 different behaviours (eating\nfruits and vegetables, eating 'non-core' snack foods, stud-\nying\/coursework, non-essential shopping, watching TV\/\nDVDs, and exercising). Multiple behaviours are included\nso that participants are not alerted to the fact that the\nfocus of the study is diet, as awareness may alter their\nreport of food consumed. The target behaviours in this\ncase are eating fruit and vegetables and eating unhealthy\nsnack foods. Participants will be asked to quantify their\nintentions towards the behaviours of interest (i.e. to say\nhow many portions of fruit and vegetables they intend toPage 3 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/123eat, and how much time they intend to spend studying\netc) for each of the three days following the test session. In\nthis way, the discrepancy between actual and intended\nbehaviour can be calculated for later analysis. In addition\nto the intention ratings, participants will also be asked to\nestimate their perceived behavioural control (as a Theory\nof Planned Behaviour construct; [18] over each of the\nintended behaviours so that any effects of executive con-\ntrol can be distinguished from effects of perceived behav-\nioural control.\n(2) Executive Control Test Battery\nParticipants will complete four established psychological\ntests; The Go\/NoGo (a replication of that used by [8]), the\nTower test, a verbal fluency task and the Trail-Making test\n[19]. The Go\/NoGo and Trail-Making task tap the two\nmain identified components of executive control that are\nnot highly related to intelligence (i.e. are purely executive)\n\u2013 inhibition of prepotent responses and mental set-shift-\ning [20]. The verbal fluency test is used as measure of cog-\nnitive flexibility\/shifting ability because flexible, creative\npatterns of thought may be associated with more success-\nful behaviour change [21], and the Tower task as a meas-\nure of planning because setting out a plan in advance is\nknow to improve the chances of successful behaviour\nchange [10].\n(3) Self-report questionnaires\nParticipants will be asked to complete the 33-item Dutch\nEating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ), as a measure of\ntheir typical eating style. The DEBQ is composed of 3 sub-\nscales \u2013 emotional eating, restrained eating and external\neating and the latter provides an estimate of how much an\nindividual's eating behaviour depends on external cues.\nThis is of interest because Temporal Self-Regulation The-\nory [9] predicts that executive control and presence\/\nabsence of external cues in the environment will interact\nto alter the likelihood of behaviour occurring. So in the-\nory, those with weak executive control should be more\nlikely to eat in response to external cues. This study will\nprovide some idea of whether the two are related and fur-\nther planned studies will address this issue in more depth.\nParticipants will also be asked to complete two self-report\nmeasures of executive control: the 20-item Dysexecutive\nQuestionnaire, and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire.\nThese measures are included to see which aspects of exec-\nutive control (as objectively measured) the self-report\nmeasures detect.\n(4) 3-Day Behaviour Diaries\nParticipants will be given computerised diaries pro-\ngrammed to give an audible alarm 3 times a day for 3 con-\nsecutive days to prompt them to make a report of each of\nthe intended behaviours. Using computerised diaries will\nensure that diary entries are made when they are requested\n(rather than filled in retrospectively at the end of the\nmeasurement period) and multiple reports over the meas-\nurement period will reduce the time between behaviour\nand report which will reduce retrospective report bias.\nUpon hearing a diary alarm, participants will be asked to\nfill in how much of each behaviour of interest they have\nperformed since the last diary alarm in a format that is\ncomparable to that used for the intention items in Part 1.\nThe diaries are Dell Axim X51s, and will run the question-\nnaire generation program Pocket Questionnaire [22].\n(5) Implementation Intention Task\nAfter return of the diaries, participants will be asked to\ncomplete the final task. They will be told that they should\nspend some time over the subsequent 24 hours thinking\nabout their dietary behaviour and decide why they think\nthey eat or drink things that are not in line with their\nintentions. Once they have come up with a few sugges-\ntions as to why this might happen in their particular case,\nthey must log onto a website where they can report their\nfindings. Each participant will be given the address of the\nwebsite, and informed that the website is currently down\nbut will be back online by the following day and they\nshould complete the task at that time. One in three partic-\nipants will be given no further instructions. The remaining\ntwo thirds will be asked to complete a short implementa-\ntion intention task (i.e. to form an if-then plan) to help\nthem to remember to complete the task and post their\nresults on the website. This task asks participants to spec-\nify when and where they will complete and the task.\nFinally, participants will be asked if they are willing to\nconsent to being re-contacted one year later and asked to\ncomplete a short questionnaire on their dietary behaviour\nat that time. Debriefing for parts 1\u20134 of the experiment\nwill occur at this point, and debriefing information for\npart 5 will be emailed to the participants after one week.\nSample size\nSample size will be 50. This was determined using the\nGPOWER computer program for a-priori power analyses\n[23], for a multiple regression analysis with 4 predictor\nvariables, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.90, and a large (0.35)\neffect of intention and executive function on change in\nconsumption of fruit and vegetables. The effect size was\nestimated to be large in line with published findings [8].\nEthical Approval\/Peer review\nThis project has be subjected to full ethical review by the\nPsychology Ethics Committee (PEC) at the School of Psy-\nchology, University of Aberdeen, and approved. In addi-\ntion the proposal has been through full peer review by the\nScottish Government Chief Scientist Office.Page 4 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2008, 8:123 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/8\/123Analysis\nAim 1\nThe discrepancy between actual and intended behaviour\non each of the two target behaviours will be calculated for\nthe 3 days of the measurement period in total by subtract-\ning the amount of actual behaviour from the amount of\nbehaviour intended. This discrepancy score will be used as\nthe dependent variable in a multiple linear regression\nmodel with the 4 executive control measures as predictor\nvariables.\nAim 2\nTotal score on the external eating subscale of the Dutch\nEating Behaviour Questionnaire will be used as the\ndependent variable in a multiple linear regression model\nwith the 4 executive control measures as predictor varia-\nbles to determine whether eating in response to external\ncues is more prevalent in those with weak executive con-\ntrol.\nAim 3\nThose assigned to the implementation intentions condi-\ntion in part 5 of the experiment will be divided (by\nmedian split) in terms of executive control scores into\n'strong executive control' and 'weak executive control'\ngroups. The rates of target behaviour (logging onto the\nwebsite) in both groups will be compared to rates of\nbehaviour in the control group using chi-square.\nDiscussion\nThis work will build on published evidence of the role of\nexecutive control in implementing intended health\nbehaviours by investigating which executive processes are\nmost important for translating dietary intentions into\naction. If multiple executive processes are found to be\ninvolved in intention-behaviour translation then public\nhealth interventions could utilise this information by\ndesigning interventions aimed at reducing the demand on\nthe identified executive processes.\nIf those with weak executive control are found to be more\nlikely to eat in response to environmental cues, then this\nwould have clear implications for advertising of\nunhealthy foods and the need for salient healthy eating\nmessages in the public domain. Finally, if those with weak\nexecutive control benefit more than others from the for-\nmation of implementation intentions then this would\nprovide evidence in favour of the use of implementation\nintentions within public health interventions.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJA conceived of and designed the study in collaboration\nwith MJ and NC. Data collection and analysis will be car-\nried out by JA. This protocol was drafted by JA and\nrevised\/commented on by MJ and NC.
