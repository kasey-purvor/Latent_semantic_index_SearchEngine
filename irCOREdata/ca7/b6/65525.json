The most important summary recommendations \nfor inclusion\/exclusion criteria were to exclude all non-peer review articles; to \nmaintain a six month lower limit for duration of study; to include interventions \nfrom before 1990; to include pre-school age groups; to include pilot studies and \nto intervene in high risk communities.

Conclusion: The differences in the results of these \ntwo reviews relates to the inclusion criteria and outcome assessments. These \nfindings underscore the importance of the evidence considered in assessing \ninterventions. \n \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nThe increasing prevalence of childhood obesity is continuing in most parts of the \nworld (1), and the search for effective intervention strategies to curb this epidemic \nis urgent. Recent evidence that the epidemic is easing off in Swedish children \nsuggests that it is possible to manage the problem (2). However, other countries \nsuch as Denmark show no leveling at all (3).   \n \nIn recent years, several published literature reviews have considered whether \nobesity prevention programs in children are effective (e.g. 4-7) Two of these \nreviews, one by Summerbell et al (5) and the other by Doak et al (6) came to very \ndifferent conclusions about the effectiveness of childhood obesity interventions. \nSummerbell et al (5) follows the Cochrane reviews method, a gold standard in \nsystematic reviews. Doak et al (6) had a similar aim and was published only a \nyear after the Summerbell et al (5) review. The Summerbell et al. (5) review \nincluded 22 studies with 4 (18%) categorized as effective. Doak et al. (6) included \n24 studies with 17 categorized as effective (71%). Whereas the reviews share \nsimilar aims, only 10 of the studies included appeared in both reviews. \n \nInitial inspection of the literature from both studies indicated differences in \ninclusion criteria and outcome definitions that may be summarized as:  1) non-\npeer review articles; 2) lower limits for duration of study; 3) choice of start date of \nsearch; 4) inclusion of pre-school age groups; 5) inclusion of aims not specific to \npreventing weight gain; 6) inclusion of pilot studies; 7) inclusion of studies \ntargeting high risk children; 8) outcome by anthropometric measures not reported \nwithin the article and finally, 9) a major difference in what was accepted as an \neffective outcome. \n \nWe would also like to point out that here were differences in funding of the two \nreviews. The cost of updating of the Summerbell et al (5) review was provided in \nkind by the authors and their institutions, along with a small amount of funding \nfrom WHO. The Doak et al (6) review was funded by the Weight Management in \nPublic Health Task Force of the European Branch of the International Life \nSciences Institute (ILSI Europe) with food industry members on the task force.  \nHowever, the task force had no influence on the selection of articles or \ninterpretation of evidence. \n \nThe aim of the present commentary is to assess the extent to which key \ndifferences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, and definition of effective \noutcomes, can explain discrepant results. Furthermore, analysis of these \ndifferences will be used to identify a general set of inclusion and exclusion criteria \nthat may contribute to the understanding of child overweight and obesity \nprevention programs. Using a single set of inclusion\/exclusion criteria the \ninterventions will be combined and the results compared to the initial studies. It is \nworth highlighting at this stage, that for many studies included in the two reviews, \ninformation needed for the review process was not reported in the published \npapers. Discrepancies in reporting of results by interventions studies contributed \n 4 \nto inconsistencies in the assessment of outcomes. The authors of both reviews \nhave identified reporting as a key barrier. This issue highlights the need for \njournals to require standardized and comprehensive reporting criteria.  \n \n \n \nDifferential inclusion and exclusion criteria \n \nThe two reviews included a total of 36 studies, with only 10 held in common. \nFourteen of the studies included by Doak et al. (6) did not meet the inclusion \ncriteria of the Summerbell et al. (5) review. Likewise, 12 studies included by \nSummerbell et al. (5) did not meet the inclusion criteria of the Doak et al. (6)  \nreview.  These differences can be explained by the following eight differences in \ninclusion\/exclusion criteria. For each of these 8 criteria, the first author from both \nreviews justifies their initial choices and a summary statement of the authors\u2019 \ndecision is made with a conclusion based on majority opinion. The authors\u2019 \ndecision is a summary statement, reflecting majority opinion of the four authors, \nand provides a general recommendation for future review writers. Furthermore, \nthe authors\u2019 decision statement will also be the basis for the criteria for \ncombining the results of the two reviews in our results section. Underlying the \ndecisions about the inclusion criteria to apply are questions relating to the quality \nof the study design, power, sources of bias, and appropriateness of the \ncomparisons for statistical analysis.  \n \n1. Inclusion of non-peer review articles: The Doak et al. (6)  review included \nstudies that were published and accessible, but did not specify that they had to \nbe peer reviewed. The allowance of non-peer reviewed articles was made to \nconsider the contribution of interventions that may have been published as book \nchapters or in another format. Only one study was included in the Doak et al. (6)  \nreview that was not peer reviewed, it was found to be effective. Authors\u2019 \ndecision: inclusion of studies that are not published in a peer-reviewed journal \nintroduces potential bias, as illustrated by the fact that the only intervention \nincluded on this basis was effective. Such studies should not be included.  \n \n2. Lower limits for duration of study: Both reviews divided studies into short and \nlong term but only the Summerbell et al. (5)  review specified a lower limit of 12 \nweeks and citing concerns about bias and weaknesses related to short term \nbehavior change data.  Two short-term studies of a duration of only 8 weeks \nwere included in the Doak et al. (6)  review \u2013 both were found to be effective. \nAssuming such very short term studies are more likely to be effective, they \nintroduce a bias towards more effective results. However, these very short term \nstudies do not contribute towards intervention models that are sustainable in the \nlong run. Indeed, even 12 weeks may be too short. Authors\u2019 decision: It is \nconcluded that the minimum duration of interventions should be set to at least 6 \nmonths. \n   \n 5 \n3. Choice of start date for inclusion of studies. Studies published before 1990 \nwere excluded from the Summerbell et al. (5)  review. The rationale for this \nexclusion is that the environment and context in which interventions are carried \nout have changed. Interventions from before 1990 may or may not, be helpful to \ncreating broad based public health interventions for today\u2019s environment. In \ncontrast, the review by Doak et al. (6)  had no exclusion by start date and \nincluded five studies from before 1990, 3 were found to be effective. The \ncontribution of these interventions would be excluded. Authors\u2019 decision: It is \nconcluded that pre-1990 publications may be included  \n \n4. Inclusion of pre-school age group:  Interventions targeting children below the \nage of six were not included in the Doak et al. (6)  review as, in some countries, \nchildren attending pre-schools are a select group, and because references used \nfor determining overweight\/obesity are not comparable to the older age group.  \nSummerbell et al. (5) included 3 interventions targeting pre-school children, 1 \nwas found to be effective. The exclusion of pre-school children may not be \njustified. While in a few countries, pre-school attendance may be a select group \npreschool attendance is increasingly widespread and in some countries even \nuniversal. As the obesity epidemic advances, school based interventions may \nneed to target children at younger ages. Authors\u2019 decision:  Pre-school studies \ncan be included provided BMI-for-age is used.  \n  \n5. Inclusion of aims not specific to preventing weight gain: Summerbell et al. (5) \ndid not include studies if the stated aim was other than preventing weight gain. \nAllowing for a more liberal inclusion criteria based on aim raises difficult \nquestions about which interventions should be included, such as interventions \nfocused on bone density or dental health, which are not likely to relate directly to \nobesity. Furthermore, strength training interventions are more likely to result in \n(muscle) weight gain compared to controls, raising challenging issues with the \nBMI outcome measures. Doak et al. (6) included a number of interventions such \nas those with an aim to increase physical activity or to reduce cardio-vascular \ndisease, as these were found to be indistinguishable from the interventions \naimed to prevent obesity. The components of these interventions would not be \ndifferent had overweight\/obesity prevention been listed amongst the aims. Six \nsuch interventions were included in the Doak et al. (6) , 4 were found to be \neffective. Authors\u2019 decision: The inclusion of interventions that focus on \nimproving obesity related behaviors is justified provided that overweight\/obesity \nwas an aim or sub-aim. However, whether interventions, that do not include \noverweight\/obesity as an explicit aim sub-aim, should be included, is still \ndebatable.  On the one hand, the collection of adiposity data can be taken to \nimply a sub aim of obesity prevention.  On the other hand, only studies with \npositive findings for these not-specified outcomes of obesity will be reported, and \nhence will likely introduce publication bias - in support of this of the 6 studies \npresented in the commentary that had different outcomes than obesity 5 were \npositive. However, it is likely that many more interventions will exist that would \n 6 \nnot have reported because a non-significant result for obesity was obtained.  \n \n6. Inclusion of pilot studies: Results from pilot studies were included in the \nSummerbell et al. (5) review. The Doak et al. (6)  review excludes pilot studies \nbecause pilot studies lack the power to show effective results. Thus inclusion of \nthese studies may bias the conclusion towards a finding that interventions are not \neffective. The Summerbell et al. (5) review chose to include pilot studies because \npower calculations are generally rarely presented up front in studies. Excluding \npilot studies based on the lack of power would also require similar considerations \nto be made because other studies may be under-powered as well. In total 6 \nstudies were classified as pilot studies, none were found to be effective. \nAuthors\u2019 decision: Pilot studies can be included provided they are peer-\nreviewed. \n \n7. Inclusion of preventions targeting high risk children: Interventions targeting \nhigh risk children, such as the children from high-risk communities, were not \nincluded in the Doak et al. (6) review as the focus was on primary prevention that \ncould be implemented on a large scale eg. community. Two studies were \nincluded in the Summerbell et al. (5) review that were targeted interventions \nfocusing on children from high risk communities, neither was found to be \neffective. Authors\u2019 decision: The exclusion of studies on obesity prevention \nprogrammes from communities at risk may not be justified as extra attention may \nbe necessary to prevent obesity in high risk groups, particularly as the obesity \nepidemic is most evident in low income communities. Thus, interventions \ntargeting high-risk communities should be included in future reviews whereas \ninterventions targeting high-risk individuals, such as children of obese families, \nmay be considered excluded.  \n \n8.Outcome by anthropometric measures not reported within the article. \nInformation from some articles did not include results for anthropometric \noutcomes such as BMI, height\/weight measures, or skinfolds in the published \nresults. It is well known that non-significant findings are more likely to be \nexcluded from published results. Thus, following recommendations to track down \nunpublished results to minimize publication bias, Summerbell et al. (5) contacted \nauthors of articles reporting data collection on anthropometric outcomes. Thus \nthe Summerbell et al. (5) review includes results not published in the original \narticle.  Because unpublished data were not subject to the peer review process \nsuch results are not included in the Doak et al. (6) review.  Authors\u2019 decision: \nWhere outcome data are not included in the publication, they cannot be \nconsidered peer reviewed and must be excluded.  \n \n9. Definition of effectiveness. In addition to differences in the above \ninclusion\/exclusion criteria, the results of the reviews also differed according to \nwhich outcomes were used to assess interventions as effective. Where \ndiscordant outcomes were reported, Summerbell et al. (5) decided on \neffectiveness using mean change in BMI. The Doak et al. (6) accepted any \n 7 \nstatistically significant, beneficial change in anthropometric outcomes as \nevidence of an \u201ceffective\u201d intervention, even where there were discordant results. \nDiscordant assessment of outcomes explains differences in the classification of \nthree articles as effective (by Doak et al. (6)) versus not effective (5). These \ndifferences relate to results that were not effective by the Summerbell et al. (5) \nreview because they were not effective by mean BMI change, but were effective \nby other measures, such as prevalence change (8), effect on slope of BMI in a \nmultivariate model for girls (9) or an effective result for skinfolds (10). Due to \nthese differences in assessing outcomes, the two reviews provide different \nconclusions even for the 10 interventions that fit the inclusion criteria of both \nreviews. The manner of assessing outcomes results in 3 out of the 10 (30%) by \nSummerbell et al. (5) compared to 6 out of the same 10 (60%) interventions \nassessed as effective by Doak et al. (6). Authors\u2019 decision: The authors \nconcluded that any obesity outcome may be acceptable, in either gender. Ideally \nan intervention will be effective both through change in mean BMI and change in \nprevalence of obesity. Due to the focus on prevention of obesity development- \nand not on weight loss \u2013prevalence change brought about through weight loss in \nthe overweight and obese groups not be considered prevention. Likewise, a \nreduction in mean BMI that is not related to improved incidence of \noverweight\/obesity is also not effective prevention. Thus where intervention \neffects on the prevalence and mean BMI differ, it is important to evaluate results \nwith caution. \n \nFinal Results: Figure 1 shows that the Summerbell et al. (5)  review had 18% \npositive results as compared to 71% positive studies from the Doak et al. (6) \nreview. Combining both reviews together results a total of 36 studies. Applying \nour agreed criteria excludes six studies from the combined total (see Appendix \nTable 1) leaving 30 studies. Figure 1 shows that after applying our exclusion \ncriteria to the combined total, 50% (15\/30) of the remaining studies are positive. \nThe exclusion by aim of the study was left open, but the impact of the exclusion \nis shown in Figure 1. Applying the criteria that studies must have an aim specific \nto preventing weight gain excludes an additional six studies (Appendix Table 2). \nIf these studies are also excluded, the proportion of effective interventions is \nreduced to 42% (10\/24) as shown in Figure 1. Details of the remaining 24 studies \nare described in Table 3 (Appendix).  \n \n 8 \nFigure 1. Combining both reviews and applying new exclusion criteria \n \n \n \nDiscussion\/Conclusions: \nThis comparison of two systematic reviews with similar aims illustrates a number \nof underlying biases that are inherent to this type of research. While decisions \nwere made based on criteria fitting scientific objectives, the differences in \ndecisions made by two independent researches highlights the subjective element \neven in carefully designed systematic reviews. In this case, the first authors of \ntwo reviews have chosen different sets of inclusion\/exclusion criteria and \noutcome assessments. While not made explicit in the reviews, there were clear \ndifferences in the handling of unpublished data and how outcomes were \nevaluated. These differences resulted also in opposite conclusions about \n\u201ceffectiveness\u201d as measured by the two reviews. The results clearly show that \ninterventions assessed by height\/weight outcome measures resulted in more \nconservative estimates of effect. Other outcome measures of obesity resulted in \nmore optimistic conclusions. After assessment of the key differences in \ninclusion\/exclusion criteria, the majority opinion of this viewpoint is that the quality \nof reviews will be improved if future reviewers exclude non-peer review articles; \nestablish a six month lower limit for duration of study; include interventions from \nbefore 1990, include pre-school age groups; include pilot studies and include \ninterventions in high risk communities.  \n \nThere was no consensus on two points, first whether or not studies with aims not \nspecific to preventing weight gain should be included and the second, the \nmanner of assessment of anthropometric measures. Both issues require further \nexploration. However, these results clearly illustrate the limitations to evaluating \ninterventions only as \u201ceffective\u201d or \u201cnot effective\u201d as many interventions show \nsignificant results only in one group or by a single outcome.
