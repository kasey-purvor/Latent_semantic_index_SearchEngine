Eighty children were interviewed using a scale to  measure\ntheir strength of national identification, and using a trait  attribution  task  and  affect  questions  to\nmeasure their attitudes towards four target groups: English people (the  ingroup),  German  people\n(a salient \u2018traditional enemy\u2019 outgroup), French people (a  salient  and  positively  liked  outgroup)\nand Dutch people (a non-salient outgroup). It was found that  the  children\u2019s  attitudes  to  German\npeople developed differently from the way in which their  attitudes  to  French  and  Dutch  people\ndeveloped. There was also consistent evidence  of  ingroup  favouritism,  at  both  ages.  However,\nthere were no significant relationships between the strength of national identification and attitudes\ntowards any of the four target groups, and there were also  no  gender  differences  on  any  of  the\nmeasures. It is argued that these findings cannot be explained by cognitive-developmental  theory.\nIn addition, while social identity theory is  able  to  explain  the  different  developmental  patterns\ndisplayed by the children\u2019s outgroup attitudes, this theory has difficulty in explaining  the  lack  of\nany relationship between the children\u2019s national identifications and attitudes. It  is  suggested  that\nEnglish children\u2019s national attitudes may be driven  more  by  exogenous  sources  of  information\nabout salient national groups than by social identity processes per se.\nIntroduction\n            This study investigated the national identifications of English children,  and  examined  the\nrelationship between these identifications and the children\u2019s national  attitudes.  In  particular,  the\nstudy explored whether these children\u2019s  strength  of  national  identification  was  related  to  their\nattitudes towards a salient and  positively  evaluated  national  outgroup  (French  people),  a  non-\nsalient national outgroup (Dutch people) and a salient national outgroup which has been perceived\nto be the \u2018traditional enemy\u2019 of the national ingroup for many years (German people).\n            England presents a complex context in which to examine the relationship between national\nidentifications and attitudes. England is one of the three constituent nations of  Great  Britain  (the\nother two being Scotland and Wales). Great Britain and  Northern  Ireland  together  make  up  the\nUnited  Kingdom  (UK).   England   has   dominated   Great   Britain   politically,   culturally   and\neconomically for several centuries, and as a result, the concept of Britishness has  acquired  strong\nAnglocentric connotations (Kumar, 2003). Condor  (1996)  and  Kiely,  McCrone  and  Bechhofer\n(2005) found that English people are sometimes confused about the difference between  the  terms\n\u2018English\u2019 and \u2018British\u2019 and may even use them interchangeably. That said, Abell,  Condor,  Lowe,\nGibson and Stevenson (2007) also found that some English people (e.g., those with extreme right-\nwing political affiliations) do draw a very  clear  and  explicit  distinction  between  \u2018English\u2019  and\n\u2018British\u2019,  and  construe  \u2018English\u2019  as  a  distinctive  category  which  is  directly  contrasted   with\n\u2018British\u2019, \u2018Scottish\u2019 and \u2018Welsh\u2019. In addition, for at  least  some  English  adults,  the  identities  of\n\u2018English\u2019 and \u2018British\u2019 are associated with  different  conceptual  contents:  \u2018English\u2019  tends  to  be\nassociated with sport (especially football and cricket), landscapes (green fields  and  rolling  hills),\narchitectural styles (English Gothic  and  Tudor),  and  cultural  heritage  (English  stately  country\nhomes) (Abell et al., 2007; Condor, 2006; Lunn,  1996),  whereas  \u2018British\u2019  is  usually  associated\nwith  the  British  Empire,  the  monarchy,  foreign  policy  and  ethnic  diversity  (Condor,   2006;\nETHNOS, 2005; Lunn, 1996; Vadher & Barrett, 2010).\n            A further difference is that the  category  of  \u2018English\u2019  is  implicitly  interpreted  by  many\nEnglish people as a racial and\/or ethnic category such that members of non-white  ethnic  minority\ngroups can never be viewed as English no matter how assimilated they may  be  in  terms  of  their\ncultural practices, attitudes and identifications (Abell et  al.,  2007;  Kumar,  2003;  Parekh,  2000;\nPhoenix, 1995). In their turn, ethnic minority individuals living in England  are  far  less  likely  to\nidentify with England and  Englishness  than  majority  white  individuals,  and  are  instead  more\nlikely  to  identify  with  Britain  and  Britishness  which,  unlike  England  and   Englishness,   are\nconstrued as superordinate and  racially  and  ethnically  inclusive  (Stone  &  Muir,  2007;  Tilley,\nExley & Heath, 2004; Vadher & Barrett, 2010).\n            However, the category of \u2018English\u2019 is not  only  defined  in  contradistinction  to  \u2018British\u2019,\n\u2018Scottish\u2019, \u2018Welsh\u2019 and ethnic and racial minority groups; it is also defined in contradistinction  to\n\u2018German\u2019 and \u2018French\u2019, two salient nations that are in close  geographical  proximity  to  England.\nGerman  people  are  especially  salient  to  English  people,  being  perceived   by   many   as   the\n\u2018traditional enemy\u2019 of England. This  perception  of  Germany  is  a  historical  legacy  of  the  two\nWorld Wars, a legacy that is regularly resuscitated, perpetuated and  promulgated  by  the  English\nmass media (especially tabloid newspapers) in their  reporting  of  relationships  between  England\nand Germany, particularly in the context of football  matches  between  the  two  countries  (Beck,\n2006; Downing, 2000; Fedeler, 2008).\n             Evaluative  attitudes  towards  German  people  are  acquired  by  English   children   at   a\nrelatively early age, and Germans are the national outgroup towards which young English children\ntypically express the least positive attitudes (Barrett, 2007; Barrett & Short, 1992; Barrett,  Wilson\n& Lyons, 2003; Byram, Esarte-Sarries and Taylor, 1991; Johnson, 1966, 1973).  That  said,  while\nEnglish children\u2019s attitudes towards  Germans  are  usually  significantly  less  positive  than  their\nattitudes towards any other national  outgroup,  German  peoples  are  not  always  described  with\npredominantly   negative   characteristics,   suggesting   that   English    children    tend    to    hold\nrepresentations of Germans which are neutral rather than negative  overall  (see  Barrett  &  Short,\n1992; Barrett et al., 2003). Indeed, in a recent study which included  English  6-,  9-,  12-  and  15-\nyear-olds, Barrett (2007) found that, at all four ages, there were no  significant  differences  in  the\nnumber  of  negative  and  positive  attributes  ascribed  to   German   people   by   these   children,\nsuggesting a neutral rather than a negative evaluation of German people overall.  That  said,  these\nsame children  did  ascribe  significantly  more  positive  than  negative  traits  to  all  of  the  other\noutgroups which were tested (Spanish, Italian, French and Scottish people)  and  Germans  were  a\nunique exception in not showing this general pattern. A second finding of  interest  was  that  there\nwere no changes in the children\u2019s overall positivity towards,  or  affect  for,  German  people  with\nage.\n            Historically, the French nation has also been a salient European outgroup in  the  evolution\nof English and  British  identity,  especially  during  the  18th  and  19th  centuries  (Kumar,  2003).\nToday, attitudes to France and to French people are generally very  positive  within  England,  and\nFrance was the second most popular holiday destination (after Spain) for  British  people  between\n2003 and 2007  (Office  for  National  Statistics,  2009).  Previous  studies  which  have  examined\nEnglish children\u2019s attitudes to  French  people  (Barrett,  2007;  Barrett  &  Short,  1992;  Johnson,\nMiddleton, & Tajfel, 1970; Middleton, Tajfel & Johnson, 1970) have revealed that French  people\nare positively liked, and that overall levels  of  positivity  towards,  and  liking  of,  French  people\ntypically do not change between 6 and 12 years of age.\n            In the  present  study,  English  children\u2019s  attitudes  towards  German,  French  and  Dutch\npeople were examined. To the best of our knowledge, this is  the  first  study  to  examine  English\nchildren\u2019s attitudes  to  Dutch  people.  Like  France  and  Germany,  The  Netherlands  is  situated\nrelatively close to England. However, the Dutch are  not  a  salient  nation  in  the  construction  of\nEnglish national identity, unlike the Germans and French. Hence, one purpose of the present study\nwas to  examine  the  extent  to  which  the  development  of  attitudes  towards  salient  outgroups\n(German and French people) is similar to, or different from, the development of attitudes  towards\na non-salient outgroup (Dutch people).\n            Social  identity  theory  postulates  that  attitudes  towards  different  outgroups  will  differ\ndepending upon the salience and relevance of those outgroups  for  the  definition  of  the  ingroup\n(Tajfel & Turner, 1986; Turner, 1999). By contrast, the cognitive-developmental  approach  to  the\ndevelopment of prejudice does not draw any conceptual distinction between attitudes to salient vs.\nnon-salient outgroups, but instead postulates that  attitudes  towards  all  outgroups  become  more\npositive through middle childhood as a consequence of changes to the child\u2019s cognitive and socio-\ncognitive understanding (Aboud, 1988; Aboud & Amato, 2001;  Doyle  &  Aboud,  1995).  Social\nidentity theory further argues that attitudes to outgroups can also vary  according  to  a  number  of\nother factors, including the perceived status  of  the  outgroup  and  the  perceived  legitimacy  and\nstability of the status differential between the outgroup and the  ingroup  (Tajfel  &  Turner,  1986;\nTurner, 1999; see also Barrett & Davis, 2008). There is existing evidence  that  English  children\u2019s\nattitudes to German and French people do  not  change  during  middle  childhood  (Barrett,  2007;\nBarrett & Short, 1992), contrary to the predictions of cognitive-developmental theory.  Hence,  the\npresent study was designed, in part, to test  between  these  two  theories:  it  was  anticipated  that\nsupport  would  be  found  for  the  predictions  of  social  identity  theory  rather  than   cognitive-\ndevelopmental theory, and that attitudes towards the three outgroups  would  develop  in  different\nways from each other.\n            A second issue which was explored  in  this  study  was  whether  the  strength  of  English\nchildren\u2019s national identifications change through the course of middle childhood. Much  previous\nresearch  into  children\u2019s  national  attitudes  has  omitted  to  measure  the   strength   of   national\nidentification (e.g. Piaget & Weil, 1951; Jahoda, 1962; Lambert & Klineberg, 1967; Middleton  et\nal., 1970). From the perspective of evaluating the findings of these earlier studies, this may  be  an\nunfortunate omission  because  social-psychological  research  with  adults  has  revealed  that  the\nstrength of identification with an ingroup can be an important influence on attitudes  towards  both\nthe ingroup and salient  comparison  outgroups,  with  there  being  systematic  differences  in  the\nattitudes of low and high identifiers (e.g., Jetten, Spears & Manstead,  2001;  Mummendey,  Klink\n& Brown, 2001; Perreault & Bourhis, 1998; Schmitt & Branscombe, 2001). Hence, in the  present\nstudy, the strength of English children\u2019s national identification was assessed in order  to  ascertain\nwhether there are any changes in  the  strength  of  national  identification  through  the  course  of\nmiddle childhood, at the time when their attitudes to other nations are developing.\n             Thirdly,  this  study  investigated  the   relationship   between   the   strength   of   national\nidentification on the one hand and children\u2019s national  attitudes  on  the  other.  It  was  anticipated\nthat, if outgroups need to be salient and relevant comparators for the definition  of  the  ingroup  in\norder for social identity processes to occur in relationship to those outgroups (as Tajfel  &  Turner,\n1986, proposed in their original formulation of social identity theory; see also  Turner,  1999,  and\nBarrett & Oppenheimer, this volume), then there may not be any relationship between the strength\nof English national identification and  attitudes  to  Dutch  people.  However,  such  a  relationship\nshould be present in the cases of attitudes to German and French people, as these  are  both  salient\nand relevant outgroups for the construction of English national identity. Hence, the  present  study\ntested this prediction made by social identity theory, namely that a  relationship  between  national\nidentifications and attitudes would only be present in the cases of attitudes to German and  French\npeople. Furthermore, because, on a strict reading, social identity theory may be construed  as  only\npredicting  relationships  between  the  strength   of   identification   and   the   magnitude   of   the\ndiscrepancy between attitudes towards the ingroup and  attitudes  towards  salient  outgroups,  this\nstudy crucially examined whether there is a relationship  between  national  identification  and  the\npositive  distinctiveness  of  the  ingroup  over   the   outgroups,   with   relationships   only   being\nanticipated in the cases of the German and French outgroups.\n            A fourth issue which was investigated was whether there are gender differences in English\nchildren\u2019s national  identifications  and  attitudes.  Previous  studies  have  suggested  that,  among\nsome populations, boys have higher levels of  national  pride  than  girls  (Amadeo,  Torney-Purta,\nLehmann, Husfeldt & Nikolova, 2002; Torney-Purta, Lehmann, Oswald & Schulz, 2001), and that\nboys sometimes hold less positive  attitudes  to  other  national  groups  than  girls  (Byram  et  al.,\n1991). However, these findings are by no means universal (see Barrett, 2007, for  a  review).  One\npossible explanation of these gender differences (where they occur) is  that  sporting  events  are  a\npotent arena in which national identifications and  attitudes  are  forged,  an  explanation  which  is\nconsistent with findings that sporting figures, events and locations are often  elicited  when  adults\n(ETHNOS, 2005) and children (Forrest & Barrett, 2001) are asked  to  produce  emblems  of  their\nown nation. The fact that boys typically have higher levels  of  interest  in  sport  than  girls  (Beal,\n1994) may therefore explain  these  gender  differences  in  national  identifications  and  attitudes,\nwhere they occur. An alternative possibility is  that  boys  watch  war  films  and  play  war  games\nmore  frequently  than  girls   (Clifford,   Gunter   &   McAleer,   1995;   Goldstein,   1992,   1994;\nValkenburg, 2004), both of which also comprise two potent sites for the constructions  of  national\nattitudes. Insofar as English-German rivalry today is primarily flagged by the British  mass  media\nin the context of sporting events where metaphorical connections are frequently made  to  the  two\nWorld Wars, it was expected that, if gender differences were to be found in the present study, then\nthey would be  most  likely  to  occur  in  the  children\u2019s  attitudes  to  German  people,  with  boys\nexhibiting less positive attitudes than girls,  and  with  boys  exhibiting  higher  levels  of  national\nidentification than girls.\n            To summarise, this study  investigated:  (i)  whether  English  children\u2019s  attitudes  towards\ndifferent national outgroups develop in a similar or varied manner  through  the  course  of  middle\nchildhood;  (ii)  whether  English  children\u2019s  strength  of  national  identification  changes  during\nmiddle  childhood;  (iii)  whether,  amongst  these  children,  there  is  a  relationship  between  the\nstrength of English national identification and the positive distinctiveness of English  people  over\nGerman and French people, but not between the strength of English national identification and the\npositive distinctiveness of English people over Dutch people; and  (iv)  whether  English  children\ndisplay gender differences in their national identifications and attitudes.\nMethod\nParticipants\n            A sample of 80 English school children (40 girls and 40 boys) participated in the study.\nThe sample was recruited from two primary schools located in the counties of Surrey and\nHampshire in the south-east of England. Because the category of English is racialised, all children\nwere of white English ethnicity. Children were recruited from two age ranges. The younger group\nconsisted of children aged 6-7 years old (mean age = 6.64, sd = 0.29), while the older group\nconsisted of children aged 10-11 years old (mean age = 10.64, sd = 0.32). Equal numbers of girls\nand boys were recruited to each age group. Table 1 shows the mean ages of the children broken\ndown by age group and gender.\nTable 1. Mean ages of participants, broken down by age and gender (with  standard  deviations  in\nparentheses).\n         Girls   Boys\n Younger          6.65     6.63\n (0.33)   (0.26)\n n = 20  n = 20\n Older  10.62   10.67\n (0.37)  (0.28)\n n = 20  n = 20\nProcedure\n             Each  child  was  interviewed  separately  in  a  quiet  room   within   their   school.   After\nestablishing rapport with the child, it was explained that  the  interviewer  was  interested  in  what\nthey thought about certain things and that the child would be asked  to  complete  some  tasks  and\nanswer some questions. Each child was reassured that they were not being tested, that  there  were\nno good or bad answers, and that no one other than the  interviewer  would  know  what  they  had\nsaid. \n             Three  tasks  were  then  administered  to  the  child.  The  first  task  consisted  of  the  six\nquestions comprising the national identification  scale,  in  which  the  term  English  was  used  to\ndenote the national identity being tested; the second task consisted of the  trait  attribution  task  in\nwhich the child was asked to select, from a set of six positive and six  negative  traits,  those  traits\nwhich applied to English people, German  people,  French  people  and  Dutch  people  (with  each\ntarget group being tested independently from the other groups); the third task  consisted  of  a  pair\nof questions designed to assess the child\u2019s general liking of\/affect towards each of the  four  target\ngroups on a five point rating scale running from like a lot to dislike  a  lot.  For  full  details  of  all\nthree tasks and the randomisation procedures which were  employed  in  their  administration,  see\nBarrett and Oppenheimer (this volume).\nResults\n            Data screening and preparation\n             The  scores  obtained  from  the  six  questions  used  to  measure  the  children\u2019s  national\nidentifications were subjected  to  an  exploratory  principal  components  analysis  using  varimax\nrotation. This revealed that all six items  loaded  onto  a  single  factor  (eigenvalue  =  2.78,  %  of\nvariance explained = 46.37%), with the loadings of the items on this  factor  ranging  between  .52\nand .76. The six items also scaled reliably (Cronbach\u2019s  alpha  =  .81).  Because  responses  to  the\nquestions were scored using a mixture of 4- and  5-point  scales,  the  responses  scored  on  the  4-\npoint scales were rescored onto  5-point  scales,  and  the  scores  on  all  six  questions  were  then\naveraged in order to derive a mean strength of  national  identification  score  (NI,  scores  ranging\nbetween 1 and 5).\n            On the trait attribution task, the total number of positive traits (PT, scores ranging from  0-\n6), the total number of negative traits (NT,  scores  ranging  from  0-6),  and  an  overall  positivity\nscore obtained by subtracting the number of  negative  traits  from  the  number  of  positive  traits\n(POS,  scores  ranging  from  -6  to  +6)  were  calculated  for  each   of   the   four   target   groups\nindividually. In addition, the positive distinctiveness attributed to English people over each of  the\nthree outgroups individually was calculated by subtracting each of the three outgroup  POS  scores\nfrom the English ingroup POS score in turn (PD, scores ranging between -12 and +12).\n            The scores from the general affect (liking) questions were  analysed  as  they  stood  (AFF,\nscores ranging from 1-5). In addition, the affective distinctiveness of English people over  each  of\nthe three outgroups individually was calculated by  subtracting  each  of  the  three  outgroup  AFF\nscores from the English ingroup AFF score in turn (AD, scores ranging between -4 and +4).\n            In the analyses reported below, only the  statistically  significant  results  are  reported.  All\nother results were non-significant.\nNational identification scores\n            The NI scores were analysed using a 2 (age group) x 2 (gender) between-groups  ANOVA,\nwhich only showed a significant main effect of  age  group  (F(1,76)  =  5.94,  p  <  .05).  National\nidentification was stronger amongst the younger children (M  =  4.42,  sd  =  0.64)  than  the  older\nchildren (M = 4.11, sd = 0.49).\nScores derived from the trait attribution task\n            The PT and NT scores were analysed using a 2 (age group) x 2 (gender) x 2 (PT vs. NT)  x\n4 (target group: English, German, French, Dutch) mixed  ANOVA,  with  independent  groups  on\nthe first two factors and repeated measures on  the  last  two  factors.  This  revealed  a  significant\nmain effect of target group (F(3, 59) = 8.13, p <  .001),  a  significant  main  effect  of  PT  vs.  NT\n(F(1,61) = 105.52, p < .001), a significant main effect of age group (F(1,61) = 9.59,  p  <  .005),  a\nsignificant interaction between target group and PT vs. NT  (F(3,59)  =  15.06,  p  <  .001),  and  a\nsignificant three-way interaction between target group, PT vs. NT and age group (F(3,59)  =  3.02,\np < .05).\n             Post  hoc  ANOVAs  and  t-tests  were  conducted  to  locate  where   these   effects   were\noccurring. These revealed that significantly more positive traits were  assigned  to  English  people\n(M = 4.19, sd = 1.47) than to French (M = 3.53,  sd  =  1.67),  Dutch  (M  =  3.01,  sd  =  1.67)  and\nGerman (M = 2.64, sd = 1.90) people, and that significantly more positive traits were  assigned  to\nFrench people than to Dutch and German people. In  addition,  significantly  more  negative  traits\nwere assigned to German people (M = 1.84, sd = 1.54) than to  English  people  (M  =  1.04,  sd  =\n1.40), French people (M = 1.07, sd = 1.42) and Dutch people  (M  =  1.35,  sd  =  1.67).  The  main\neffect of PT vs. NT was due to more positive traits than negative traits being assigned  to  all  four\ngroups (see preceding means). The main effect  of  age  group  was  due  to  the  younger  children\nassigning more positive traits and more negative traits overall than the older children (see Table  2\nfor means).\nTable 2.

The relevant means are shown  in\nTable 2. Post hoc analyses revealed that the English PT and NT scores did not differ as a  function\nof  age,  the  French  and  Dutch  NT  scores  (but  not  the  French  and  Dutch  PT   scores)   were\nsignificantly lower in the older children than in the younger children, while the German PT  scores\n(but not the German NT scores) were significantly lower in the older children than in the  younger\nchildren. In other words, the pattern of age differences in relationship to the  three  outgroups  was\ndifferent  depending  upon  whether  the  target  group  was  the  \u2018traditional  enemy\u2019  outgroup  or\nanother kind of outgroup.\n            Next, the overall positivity (POS) scores for each of the four target  groups  were  analysed\nusing a 2 (age group) x 2 (gender)  x  4  (target  group:  English,  German,  French,  Dutch)  mixed\nANOVA, with independent groups on  the  first  two  factors  and  repeated  measures  on  the  last\nfactor. This revealed only a significant main effect of target group (F(3,183) =  18.46,  p  <  .001).\nPost hoc t-tests revealed that all four means were significantly different from each  other  (English\nM = 3.05, sd = 1.94; French M = 2.52, sd = 2.30; Dutch M = 1.69, sd = 2.26;  German  M  =  0.81,\nsd = 2.51). One-sample t-tests further showed that all four means were significantly higher than 0,\nindicating that attitudes to all four national  groups  were  positive  overall,  including  attitudes  to\nGermans (German t(72) = 2.75, p < .01).\n            Table 3.

This revealed\na significant main effect of PD score (F(2,122)  =  13.24,  p  <.001)  and  a  significant  interaction\nbetween PD score and age group (F(2,122) =  3.17,  p  <.05).  The  relevant  means  are  shown  in\nTable 3. Post hoc t-tests revealed that the three overall PD scores  were  all  significantly  different\nfrom each other. However, amongst the younger children, the  English-German  and  the  English-\nDutch PD scores did not differ significantly from each other but both were  significantly  different\nfrom the English-French PD scores. By contrast, amongst the older  children,  the  English-French\nand the English-Dutch  PD  scores  did  not  differ  significantly  from  each  other  but  both  were\nsignificantly different from the English-German PD scores. As the figures in Table  3  show,  with\nincreasing age, the positive distinctiveness of the ingroup over  the  \u2018traditional  enemy\u2019  outgroup\nincreased,  while  the  positive  distinctiveness  of  the  ingroup  over   the   other   two   outgroups\ndecreased.\nScores derived from the affect questions\n            The affect (AFF) scores were analysed using  a  2  (age  group)  x  2  (gender)  x  4  (target\ngroup: English, German, French, Dutch) mixed ANOVA,  with  independent  groups  on  the  first\ntwo factors and repeated measures on the last factor. This only revealed a  significant  main  effect\nof target (F(3,66) = 38.50, p < .001).\n            Post hoc t-tests indicated that affect was significantly higher towards English people (M  =\n4.68, sd = 0.62) than to French (M = 3.85, sd = 0.97), German (M =  3.25,  sd  =  1.32)  and  Dutch\n(M = 3.19, sd = 1.15) people, and that affect was also significantly higher towards  French  people\nthan to German and Dutch people. However, affect  towards  German  and  Dutch  people  did  not\ndiffer significantly. One-sample t-tests further  revealed  that  while  affect  towards  both  English\npeople (t(75) = 23.85, p < .001) and  French  people  (t(77)  =  7.72,  p  <  .001)  was  significantly\nhigher than the neutral mid-point of the affect scale (3), affect towards German people  and  Dutch\npeople was not significantly higher than the neutral midpoint.\n            The affective distinctiveness (AD) scores were then analysed  using  a  2  (age  group)  x  2\n(gender) x 3 (AD score: English-German, English-French, English-Dutch)  mixed  ANOVA,  with\nindependent groups on the first two factors and repeated  measures  on  the  last  factor.  This  also\nonly revealed a significant main effect of AD score (F(2,136) = 9.48, p  <  .001).  Post  hoc  t-tests\nshowed that English-German AD (M = 1.39, sd = 1.51) and English-Dutch AD  (M  =  1.49,  sd  =\n1.26) did not differ, but both were significantly larger than English-French  AD  (M  =  0.81,  sd  =\n1.07).\nTable 4.

The\nresults are shown in Table 4. Some of the significant correlations were expected (due  to  the  non-\nindependence of the measures involved), particularly those between the PT and NT scores  on  the\none hand and the corresponding POS and PD scores on the other hand.  Similarly,  the  significant\ncorrelations between the AFF scores and the corresponding AD scores were also expected.\n            More interestingly, the following patterns  are  apparent  from  Table  4.  First,  there  were\nno significant correlations between the NI  scores  and  any  of  the  attitudinal  measures.  Second,\naffect towards English people (AFFEng) did not correlate significantly  with  any  other  measures\n(except with the three AD scores, which can be disregarded as the AFFEng  and  AD  scores  were\nnon-independent).  Third,  all  of  the  PT  scores  for  the  four  target  groups  were   significantly\ncorrelated with each other (and four out of the six pairs of NT scores were significantly  correlated\nwith each other as well). This suggests that children\u2019s attitudes to national groups are structured in\nsuch a way that if they are positive towards one group, they are positive to all groups.  Fourth,  the\nPT and NT scores for the two salient outgroups (German, French) were  systematically  related  to\nthe AFF scores for those outgroups; however, this relationship was not present in the  case  of  the\ningroup (English) nor in the case of the non-salient outgroup (Dutch).\nDiscussion\n            This study was designed to investigate four  main  research  questions.  The  first  question\nwas whether English children\u2019s attitudes towards different national outgroups develop in a similar\nor varied manner through the course  of  middle  childhood.  The  study  found  differences  in  the\ndevelopment of attitudes to the three outgroups. For example,  the  children\u2019s  attitudes  to  French\npeople were more positive than their attitudes to both Dutch and German people (e.g.,  as  indexed\nby both positive trait attributions and affect). However,  while  on  some  measures  the  children\u2019s\nattitudes to Dutch and German people were not significantly  different  (e.g.  on  the  positive  trait\nattributions and on affect), the children\u2019s attitudes to Dutch people developed in a  similar  way  to\ntheir attitudes to French people (with the number of negative traits  ascribed  to  these  two  groups\ndecreasing with age), while their attitudes to German people displayed a  different  developmental\npattern (in which the number of positive traits ascribed to Germans decreased with age:  see  Table\n2). It was also  found  that  the  positive  distinctiveness  of  English  people  over  German  people\nbecame more pronounced with age, while the positive distinctiveness of English  people  over  the\nother two outgroups showed the opposite pattern (see  Table  3).  However,  while  affect  towards\nFrench people  was  significantly  higher  than  the  neutral  mid-point  of  the  affect  scale,  affect\ntowards both German and Dutch people was not significantly higher than the neutral mid-point  of\nthe scale.\n            This differentiated pattern in the development of attitudes towards outgroups suggests  that\nthe cognitive-developmental explanation of the development of prejudice (Aboud, 1988; Aboud &\nAmato, 2001), according to which attitudes towards all outgroups become more  positive  through\nmiddle  childhood  as  a  consequence  of  developmental  shifts   in   the   child\u2019s   socio-cognitive\nunderstanding of large-scale social groups, is inadequate, as  it  fails  to  explain  why  attitudes  to\ndifferent outgroups develop in these different ways. Cognitive-developmental theory also  fails  to\nexplain why, in the present  study,  the  number  of  positive  traits  ascribed  to  Germans  actually\ndecreased, rather than increased, with age: this trend is in direct contradiction to the predictions of\ncognitive-developmental theory (Doyle, Beaudet & Aboud, 1988; Doyle & Aboud, 1995).\n            By contrast, social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1986; Turner 1999), which  postulates\nthat intergroup attitudes are  influenced  by  a  number  of  factors  (including  the  salience  of  the\noutgroup concerned and its  relevance  for  the  definition  of  the  ingroup,  and  the  status  of  the\noutgroup in  relationship  to  the  ingroup)  is  able  to  account  for  the  differentiated  patterns  of\nattitudes  to  the  different  outgroups.  Indeed,  social  identity  theory   can   readily   explain   the\ndifferences displayed in the development of  attitudes  to  German  people  vs.  French  and  Dutch\npeople: older children are more likely than younger children to have  knowledge  of  the  historical\nintergroup relationships which have existed between England and Germany; hence, differences  in\nattitudes towards German people vs. the other two outgroups are more likely  to  be  displayed  by\nthe older children than the younger children (the pattern which was indeed found in this study).\n            The second research question which  was  addressed  by  this  study  was  whether  English\nchildren\u2019s strength of national identification changes during middle childhood. It  was  found  that\nthe strength of national identification decreased significantly between 6-7 and 10-11 years of  age.\nThat said, it should be noted that national identification was still very strong, even at the age of 10-\n11: on a 5-point scale, the mean  strength  of  identification  at  10-11  years  was  4.11.  It  is  also\nimportant to note that this study yielded evidence of ingroup favouritism, with the children at both\nages showing significantly greater positivity towards the ingroup on several measures (e.g. on  the\nnumber of positive traits attributed  to  English  people,  on  overall  positivity,  and  on  affect  for\nmembers of the ingroup). Hence, care needs to be taken in not  overplaying  this  reduction  in  the\nstrength of national identification between these two ages. However, one  possible  explanation  of\nthis reduction is that, by the age of 10-11, other identities are increasing in salience for the child as\nhe or she begins to embark on a more extensive exploration of self (Marcia, 1980;  Kroger,  2004),\nand it may be the competition from these other identities which is responsible for the reduction  in\nthe strength of national identification at the threshold of adolescence.\n            The third research question which this  study  sought  to  address  was  whether  there  is  a\nrelationship between the strength of national identification and the positive  distinctiveness  of  the\ningroup  over  salient  comparison  outgroups.  The  outcome  of  the  correlational   analysis   was\nconsistent and clear on this  issue:  there  was  no  relationship  between  the  strength  of  national\nidentification and any of the attitudinal measures. From the perspective  of  social  identity  theory\nand research with adults which has shown that there are widespread differences in the attitudes  of\nhigh and low identifiers (e.g., Jetten, Spears & Manstead,  2001;  Mummendey,  Klink  &  Brown,\n2001; Perreault & Bourhis, 1998; Schmitt & Branscombe,  2001),  this  outcome  is  surprising.  It\nsuggests that identification  with  the  national  ingroup  is  not  a  dominant  factor  in  driving  the\ndevelopment of children\u2019s national attitudes, at least not amongst English children. It  is  pertinent\nto note that that this finding is consistent with previous findings reported by  Barrett  (2007),  who\nsimilarly failed to find any consistent relationship  between  national  identifications  and  national\nattitudes in 6-, 9-, 12- and 15-year old English children. The issue of the  age  at  which,  and  how\nand why, national identifications  become  a  significant  predictor  of  national  attitudes  amongst\nEnglish people remains an open question for future research involving  older  children  and  young\nadults to  address.  However,  one  distinct  possibility  is  that  children\u2019s  attitudes  towards  other\nnational groups are  driven  neither  by  their  endogenous  cognitive-development,  nor  by  social\nidentity processes, but by external sources of information, including  holidays  in  other  countries,\nschool teaching and school textbooks, representations in the mass media and peer group discourse.\nOne of the available theories of how children\u2019s  national  and  ethnic  identifications  and  attitudes\ndevelop, namely  societal-social-cognitive-motivational  theory  (Barrett,  2007,  2009;  Barrett  &\nDavis, 2008), proposes that  all  of  these  factors,  as  well  as  cognitive  development  and  social\nidentity processes, can play a role in the development of intergroup attitudes.  The  evidence  from\nthe present study suggests that this kind of conceptual framework may  indeed  be  required  if  we\nare to explain all of the different patterns of development and their associated casual factors which\nhave now been documented within different national and socio-historical contexts.\n            Fourthly and finally, this research also sought to examine whether English children display\ngender differences in their national identifications  and  attitudes.  Once  again,  the  study  yielded\nclear and unambiguous findings: no gender  differences  emerged  in  any  of  the  analyses  which\nwere conducted. Hence, this  study  adds  support  for  the  note  of  caution  expressed  by  Barrett\n(2007) concerning the lack of consistency  concerning  gender  differences  in  children\u2019s  national\nidentifications and attitudes: gender differences are indeed far from universal in this domain.\n            In addition to these four principal outcomes,  a  number  of  incidental  findings  were  also\nobtained in this study. For example, it was  found  that  the  attributions  of  positive  and  negative\ntraits to  different  national  groups  were  inter-correlated.  This  suggests  that  children  who  feel\npositively toward their own national group also feel  positively  toward  other  national  outgroups,\nwhile children who feel more negatively about their national ingroup feel  more  negatively  about\nother  national  groups.  It  was  also  found  that  trait  attributions  to  salient  national   outgroups\ncorrelate with affect towards those outgroups, but the same relationship does not apply in the  case\nof  non-salient  outgroups  or  the  ingroup.  This  latter  finding  provides   further   evidence   that\nchildren\u2019s attitudes towards outgroups are differentiated rather than uniform.\n            It should be acknowledged that there are limitations to the present study. First,  the  sample\nsize is relatively small, with only 80 children being tested  in  total.  Second,  it  would  have  been\nuseful to test additional children at other ages, particularly  through  the  years  of  adolescence,  in\norder to ascertain when the relationship between national identifications and  national  attitudes  is\nestablished. Third, the measures which were used in  this  study  were  global  and  quantitative  in\nnature.   They   precluded   obtaining   more   fine-grained    information    about    the    children\u2019s\nunderstanding of national groups  and  their  own  national  identifications.  Future  studies  would\nbenefit from including qualitative open-ended questions to explore in greater detail children\u2019s own\nsubjective perspectives on these issues.\n            In conclusion, this study  has  shown  that  children\u2019s  attitudes  to  national  outgroups  are\ndifferentiated. Depending upon  the  particular  outgroup  concerned,  children\u2019s  attitudes  display\ndifferent developmental patterns. In particular, in the case of English children, attitudes to German\npeople (the \u2018traditional enemy\u2019 nation) were found to develop differently from their attitudes  to  a\npositively liked outgroup (French people) and their  attitudes  to  a  non-salient  national  outgroup\n(Dutch people). These findings cannot be  readily  explained  by  cognitive-developmental  theory,\nbut can be explained by social identity theory. That said,  social  identity  theory  has  difficulty  in\nexplaining the further finding  obtained  in  this  study  that  national  identifications  and  national\nattitudes are not related in English children. It is possible that a more  comprehensive  model  such\nas societal-social-cognitive-motivational theory is instead required in order to explain  the  present\nfindings.\nReferences\nAbell, J., Condor, S., Lowe, R.D., Gibson, S.  &  Stevenson,  C.
