The variability in39\ntillage system parameters reflects the variability in soil engineering properties and the variations40\nin tool design parameters and operational conditions. The variability in soil engineering41\nproperties is resulted from the heterogeneity of agricultural soils. The variations in tool design42\nparameters are due to the manufacturing processes, while the variations in operational conditions43\nare due to the fact that these parameters are not completely controlled during tillage operation.44\nThe crescent manner of soil failure for wide and narrow tines with depth\/width ratio less than 545\ntend to push the soil upward and forward [1]. This failure pattern involves the development of46\nsuccessive shear planes in front and at the side of tillage tools, which leads to distinct soil failure47\n3blocks (crescents) as the tine moves forward through the soil. The repeated formation of soil48\ncrescents creates cyclic loading on the tillage tool. Stafford [2] identified two types of soil failure,49\nnamely the brittle failure and the flow failure. Rajaram and Erbach [3] reported the following four50\nsoil failure patterns: 1) collapse failure, 2) fracture failure, 3) chip-forming failure and 4) plastic51\nand frictional flow failures. However, they attributed the changes of soil failure patterns to two52\nmain factors: the soil type and the moisture content. In other work, Rajaram and Erbach [4]53\nreported that the variations in soil failure patterns are mostly affected by the soil moisture content,54\nsoil type, tillage implement type and tillage speed. Factors controlling the soil mechanical55\nbehaviour during failure under load are not completely understood\/known. In addition, there are56\nno available models that can estimate the effects of soil failure on tillage forces.57\nSeveral analytical (e.g. McKyes and Ali [5]; Grisso et al. [6]) and numerical models (e.g. Shen58\nand Kushwaha [7]; Mouazen and Nem\u00e9nyi [8]) of soil-tool interaction have been developed to59\npredict tillage forces for assigned tillage system parameters. Furthermore, the effects of tillage60\nsystem parameters on tillage forces have been investigated [1,9]. Although, these models have61\nshown good agreements with experimental observations for specific test conditions, there is still62\nno well-defined, generalised theoretical model to predict the behaviour of soil-tool interactions63\n[10]. In order to take into consideration the fact that tillage system parameters are variable during64\ntillage operations, Abo Al-kheer et al. [11] proposed a methodology for modeling the variability65\nin tillage forces derived from the variability in tillage system parameters. In another report, they66\nintegrated this variability into the reliability analysis for achieving reliable tillage machines [12].67\nThe variability in tillage forces due to the soil failure has been observed in many works in the68\nliterature. James and Shrini [13] reported that the large variations in the horizontal force on a69\nplough can be attributed to two factors. These are related to the soil failure and to the within-field70\nspatial variability in soil properties. They confirmed that both of these factors lead to relatively71\nlarge changes in the horizontal force within a short time period. Makanga et al. [14] studied the72\n4effects of the tine rake angle and the aspect ratio in a laboratory glass-sided soil bin with a dry73\ncompacted loam soil with 5.2 % (d.b.) moisture content. They concluded that the horizontal and74\nvertical soil reactions under dry soil conditions were cyclic in nature and in phase. The cyclic75\nvariations in the soil reactions were due to the soil failure patterns being repetitive and cyclic in76\nnature throughout the tine travel. Due to variability in soil properties and operational conditions77\nthe frequency and amplitude of these cycles vary significantly.78\nForm a fatigue analysis viewpoint, it is essential to account for the effects of the variability in79\ntillage forces on the resulted stress on tillage machines. The current state of knowledge suggests80\nthat there are only experimental works available to estimate the spatial variability in tillage forces81\n[15,16,17]. These methods do not provide a tool for estimating the life time of tillage tools due to82\nfatigue as it cannot account for all affecting parameters.83\nThe main objective of this work is to propose a model for estimating the variability in tillage84\nforces for the purpose of fatigue analysis of tillage machines. The proposed model is applied to85\nestimate the spatial variability in tillage forces on the shank of a chisel plough and the expected86\ndistance to failure is calculated. This model is presented in the first part of this work. The second87\npart presents the stress-based fatigue life approach used to estimate the life time of tillage88\nmachines.89\n90\n2- Materials and methods91\n2-1 Modeling the spatial variability of tillage forces92\n2-1-1 Basic assumptions for the proposed model93\nThe basic assumptions behind the proposed model are that 1) the spatial variability of tillage94\nforces derived from the variability in tillage system parameters is random, reflecting the95\nheterogeneity in agricultural soils, the uncontrolled field operational conditions during tillage and96\n5the manufacturing tolerances of tool design parameters and 2) the spatial variability of tillage97\nforces derived from the mechanical behavior of soil failure is cyclic, reflecting the repeated98\nformation of soil crescents in front of the tool. In addition, we suppose that the total tillage force99\nis the sum of two types of forces, namely the global tillage force and the local tillage force. The100\nglobal tillage force is due to the tillage system parameters (soil engineering properties, tool design101\nparameters and operational conditions) and the local tillage force is due to the soil failure of102\ncyclic nature.103\nConventionally, a tillage force is determined by its horizontal and vertical components.104\nTherefore, the horizontal and vertical forces can be calculated, according the earlier assumption,105\nby Equations (1) and (2).106\n= + (1)\n= + (2)\nwhere is the global horizontal force in kN, is the local horizontal force in kN, is the107\nglobal vertical force in kN and is the local vertical force in kN.108\nThe variability in the global tillage forces ( , ) can be modelled using the methodology109\nproposed by Abo Al-kheer et al. [11]. This methodology is based on the estimation of tillage110\nforces according to the McKyes-Ali model accounting for the variability in tillage system111\nparameters. Abo Al-kheer et al. [11] subdivided the tillage system parameters contributing to the112\nglobal tillage forces into three main categories: 1) soil engineering properties including soil bulk113\ndensity, soil cohesion, internal friction angle, soil-metal friction angle and soil-tool adhesion), 2)114\ntool design parameters including tool width and rake angle and 3) operational conditions115\nincluding tool working depth, surcharge pressure and tool speed. A combination of graphical and116\nquantitative techniques was proposed for modeling the variability in soil engineering properties117\nand two statistical tests were used to select the probability distributions of these properties,118\n6namely the chi-square test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A total of 57 variations of soil119\nengineering properties, representing 57 different soil samples were considered for implementing120\nour mixed technique approach [11]. The probabilistic characteristics of these properties are given121\nin Table 1.122\nThe local tillage forces ( , ) have been observed in many works in the literature but there123\nare no available models can be used to estimate these forces. However, the majority of reports are124\nattributing these forces to nearly the same parameters contributing to the global tillage forces [4].125\nTherefore, we assume that the local tillage force components can be estimated as a percentage of126\nthe global tillage force components as shown in Equations (3) and (4).127\n= . (3)\n= . (4)\nwhere is the percentage of the local tillage force to the global tillage force. According to the128\nassumptions in Equations 3 and 4 global and local forces are related by the tillage system129\nparameters (soil engineering properties, tool design parameters and operational conditions). The130\nhigh values of corresponding to a brittle soil failure and the little values of corresponding to a131\nflow soil failure. In other words, the values of the local tillage forces ( , ) are important for132\nthe brittle soil failure since the force cyclic pattern is much more pronounced that with flow133\nfailure, while the values of these forces are nearly zero when the soil failure is of flow type [10].134\nThe linear correlation between the global and local tillage forces may not be accurate for all soil135\ntexture types and all operational conditions. Thus, more work should be done to investigate the136\nrelationship between the global and local tillage forces.137\nBased on the earlier assumptions, the spatial variability in tillage forces can be represented by the138\nspatial variability in the global and local tillage forces, as shown in Equations (5) and (6).139\n( ) = ( ) + ( ) (5)\n( ) = ( ) + ( ) (6)\n7where represents the spatial variability in the global horizontal force in kN, represents140\nthe spatial variability in the local horizontal force in kN, represents the spatial variability in141\nthe global vertical force in kN, represents the spatial variability in the local vertical force in142\nkN and is the distance travelled in .143\n2-1-2 Modeling the spatial variability in the global tillage forces144\nThe spatial variability in the global tillage forces ( , ) is resulted from the spatial variability145\nof soil resistance and uncontrolled operational conditions. This spatial variability can be146\nattributed to several factors, e.g., the characteristics of the field, the geography and topography of147\nthe field and the soil management system (no-till, reduced till or conventional tillage). Therefore,148\nthe spatial variability in the global tillage forces changes from one location to another within the149\nsame field and from field to field.150\nTo take the earlier observations into account, we modelled the spatial variability in the global151\ntillage forces with the following assumptions: 1) the spatial variability in the global tillage forces152\nis linear and 2) the distance between two successive changes of the values of global tillage153\nforces is random. The linearity of the spatial variability in the global tillage forces between the154\nglobal tillage force samples may not be an accurate assumption. However, the increase of the155\nglobal tillage force samples improves the accuracy of this model. Taking the distance as a156\nrandom variable allows considering the variability in the field characteristics over the distance .157\nBased on these assumptions, the spatial variability in the global tillage forces can be expressed as158\nin Equations (7) and (8). An illustration of the spatial variability in the global tillage forces over159\nthe distance is shown in Figure 1.160\n( ) = ( ) + ( + 1)\u2212 ( ) \u2212 \u2211 ( )( ) = 1, \u2026 , (7)\n( ) = ( ) + ( + 1) \u2212 ( ) \u2212 \u2211 ( )( ) = 1, \u2026 , (8)\n8where ( ) is the ith global horizontal force sample in kN, ( ) is the ith global vertical161\nforce sample in kN, is the distance between two successive changes of the global tillage force162\nvalues in , \u2211 ( ) is the cumulative sum of ( ) for = 1 to \u2212 1 and is the number of163\nthe global tillage force samples.164\n2-1-3 Modeling the spatial variability in the local tillage forces165\nAs mentioned before, the soil failure creates cyclic loading on tillage tools by the repeated166\nformation of soil crescents. The global tillage forces are calculated at failure when the tillage167\nforces achieve their maximum values. The local tillage forces reach their maximum values at168\nfailure and then drop down after the first soil block has formed and these forces will increase to169\nform the second soil block until achieve failure and so on. Therefore, we can imagine that the170\ntotal tillage forces fluctuate below the global tillage forces.171\nBased on the fact that the effect of the soil failure in the tillage forces is cyclic, the sinusoid172\nfunction was used to describe the spatial variability in the local tillage forces with the173\namplitude and cycle length . Therefore, the spatial variability of tillage forces can be174\nexpressed as in Equations (9) and (10) and illustrated as in Figure 2. The terms \u2212 ( ) and175\n\u2212 ( ) are added to these Equations to keep the values of total tillage forces fluctuate below the176\nvalues of global tillage forces.177\n( ) = ( ) sin 2 \u2212 \u2211 ( )\u2212 \u2211 ( )( ) \u2212 ( ) = 1, \u2026 , (9)\n( ) = ( ) sin 2 \u2212 \u2211 ( ) \u2212 \u2211 ( )( ) \u2212 ( ) = 1, \u2026 , (10)\nwhere ( ) is the jth local horizontal force in kN, ( ) is the jth local vertical force in kN,178\n( ) is the cycle length of the jth cycle in , is the number of calculated values in a cycle and179\nis the number of cycles between two successive changes of the global tillage forces.180\n92-1-4 Modeling the spatial variability in the total tillage forces181\nBy combining the spatial variability in the global and local tillage forces and taking into account182\nthe assumption that the local tillage force components can be estimated as a percentage of the183\nglobal tillage force components, it concluded that the spatial variability in tillage forces can be184\nrepresented by the following five parameters:185\n( ) = (PHG, S1, S2, ) (11)\n( ) = (PVG, S1, S2, ) (12)\nAll of these parameters can be considered as variables to represent the variability in the forces on186\nthe tillage tool during the tillage operation, as shown in Figure 3.187\n2-1-5 Special cases188\nTwo special cases of spatial variability in tillage forces, namely, at constant global tillage forces189\nand at insignificant local tillage forces are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The first case190\nsupposes that all tillage system parameters do not vary during tillage. This assumption may be191\nsuitable for quasi-homogeneous soils and when the variations in the operational conditions are192\nnot important. The second case can be used to represent the spatial variability in tillage forces193\nwhen the soil failure is of flow type. However, in most cases, both the global and local tillage194\nforces should be taken into consideration in the estimation of the spatial variability in tillage195\nforces.196\n197\n2-2 Stress-based fatigue life198\nThe stress-based fatigue life approach is generally characterized by a high-cycle fatigue199\nmethodology, and is widely used in design applications where the applied stress is primarily200\nwithin the elastic range of the material and the resulting fatigue life is long. The basis of the201\n10\nstress-based fatigue life approach is the stress (S)-number of cycles to failure (N) curve, also202\nknown as a W\u00f6hler curve. The S-N curve is a graph of the amplitude of a cyclical stress against203\nthe logarithmic scale of cycles to failure. In some materials, particularly ferrous alloys, the S-N204\ncurve flattens out eventually, so that below a certain limit, called the fatigue limit or the205\nendurance limit (typically > 10 cycles), the material may not fail and can be cycled infinitely206\n[18] (curve a in Figure 6). For some other materials such as aluminum and copper alloys, no207\nfatigue limit exists. In such cases, the fatigue strength for a given number of cycles (e.g. 1 \u00d7 10208\ncycles) must be specified [19] (curve b in Figure 6).209\nThe S-N curve for a material, that has a fatigue limit such as steel, can be expressed as in210\nEquation (13).211\n= . <\u2265 (13)\nwhere is the stress amplitude in MPa, is the regression intercept (also called the fatigue212\nstrength coefficient) in MPa, is the regression slope (also called the fatigue strength exponent),213\nis the number of cycles and is the number of cycles corresponding to the fatigue limit .214\nThe most basic S-N curves are generated using a fully-reversed stress, where the ratio (R)215\nbetween the maximum and minimum stress is equal to -1. When the stress applied on a structure216\nis constant over the structure life and the ratio (R) is equal to -1, the Equation (13) can be used217\ndirectly to determine the number of cycles to failure i.e. the fatigue life. If the number of cycles to218\nfailure is greater than the number of cycles corresponding to the fatigue limit , it can be219\naccepted that the structure has an infinite life.220\nWhen the ratio R is not equal to -1, a Haigh diagram is usually used to estimate the fatigue life.221\nThis diagram plots the mean stress along the x-axis and the stress amplitude along the y-axis and222\nthe lines of constant life are drawn through the data points. A very substantial amount of testing is223\nrequired to generate a Haigh diagram, and it is usually impractical to develop curves for all224\n11\ncombinations of mean and amplitude stresses. Therefore, several empirical criteria that relate the225\nstress amplitude to the mean stress have been developed to address this difficulty. These criteria226\ndefine various curves to connect the fatigue limit on the stress amplitude axis to either the yield227\nstrength or the ultimate strength on the mean stress axis [20]. The zone under the curves defined228\nthe safe zone against fatigue while the zone above the curves represents the failure zone. Figure 7229\nillustrates three of these criteria, namely the criterions of Goodman, Gerber and Soderberg.230\nKwofie [21] proposed a function, presented in Equation (14), to take into account the effect of231\nmean stress. This function allows determining the stress amplitude according to the material232\nconstant, material properties, number of cycles to failure and to different fatigue criteria.233\n= 1 \u2212 (14)\nwhere is a numerical constant, representing the mean stress sensitivity of the material, is the234\nmean stress in MPa and is the ultimate strength in MPa. The value of the numerical constant235\ndepends on the fatigue criterion (Goodman, Gerber, Soderberg, etc.).236\nIn practice, a structure (e.g. tillage machines) is exposed to a random stress. In such cases, the237\nrandom stress should be reduced to a series of simple cyclic stresses using counting methods, e.g.,238\nrange pair method and rainflow method [22]. The rainflow method is the most popular and widely239\nused in practice [23]. It allows one to determine the amplitude and mean value ( , ) for each240\nstress cycle at a fixed time interval or a distance interval . The damage friction caused by the241\nith cycle of stress can be computed by Equation (15).242\n= 1( , ) (15)\nwhere ( , ) is the number of cycles to failure according to the amplitude and the243\nmean value . In this work, the Soderberg criterion was used to determine , based on the244\n12\nfact that the applied stress is primarily within the elastic range of the material. According to this245\ncriterion, = \/ [21] and was calculated as in Equation (16).246\n= 1 \u2212 \/ \/ (16)\nThe total damage, caused by all cycles, can be computed by a cumulative damage model. More247\nthan 60 fatigue damage models have been proposed for this purpose. However, the linear damage248\nrule (Miner\u2019s law) is still dominantly used because of its simplicity in addition to its sufficient249\naccuracy [24]. For these reasons the Miner\u2019s law was used in this work. The Miner\u2019s law assumes250\nthat the total damage can be expressed as the sum of damage frictions, as shown in Equation (17).251\nFailure is assumed to occur when \u2265 1.252\n= (17)\nwhere is the number of cycles determined by the rainflow algorithm for the time interval or253\nthe distance interval . If the total damage is calculated for a distance interval , which is the254\ncase of our work, the expected travel distance to failure can be calculated by dividing the distance255\ninterval by the total damage, i.e. = \/ , to fulfill the assumption that the failure will occur256\nwhen \u2265 1.257\n258\n3- Numerical application259\n3-1 Modeling the spatial variability in tillage forces260\nThe proposed model, presented in Section 2.1, is implanted in MATLAB program (Mathworks261\nINC. 2008) to model the spatial variability in tillage forces on the shank of a chisel plough shown262\nin Figure 8. The shank cross-section is rectangular of height \u210e = 58 and width = 32 ,263\nas shown in Figure 9.264\n13\nAbo Al-kheer et al. [11] found that the variability in the global horizontal and vertical forces265\nfollowed lognormal distributions. The distribution parameters of these forces were = 0.872,266\n= 0.449, = 0.004 and = 0.447, where and are the scale and shape267\nparameters of a lognormal distribution, respectively. The correlation coefficient between and268\nwas found to be ( , ) = 0.93. Therefore, the variability in the local horizontal and269\nvertical forces should have lognormal distributions with the following distribution270\nparameters = ln( ) + , = , = ln( ) + and = . In this271\nwork, was selected to be equal 0.2 for brittle failure. Furthermore, we assumed272\nthat and have normal distributions with the following distribution parameters =273\n10, = 0.1 , = 0.05 and = 0.1 , where and are the location and scale274\nparameters of a normal distribution, respectively. The distribution parameters of the main model275\nparameters, as described in Equations (11) and (12), are listed in Table 2.276\nTo generate correlated tillage forces and , two non-correlated normalized variables277\nand were generated by the MATLAB function \u201cnormrnd\u201d and then the random values of278\nand were calculated using two transformations [25,26]. The first one transforms non-279\ncorrelated normalized variables and to correlated normalized variables and and the280\nsecond one transforms correlated normalized variables to correlated tillage forces and .281\nThe spatial variability of the horizontal and vertical forces can then be shown in Figure 10 for a282\ndistance of 1000 .283\nFrom Figure 10, it can be observed that a clear correlation exists in the spatial variability between284\nthe horizontal and vertical forces. This is resulted from the correlation between the global285\nhorizontal and vertical forces ( ( , ) = 0.93). Another observation is the correlation286\nbetween the global tillage forces ( , ) and the local tillage forces ( , ). The increase287\nof global tillage forces increases the amplitudes of local tillage forces and vice-versa. These288\n14\nincreases in force amplitudes are marked in cycles in Figure 10. This is caused by the calculation289\nof the local tillage forces as a percentage of the global tillage forces.290\n3-2 Equivalent stress history291\nThe equivalent stress, resulted from the tillage forces, was calculated according to the Von misses292\ncriterion. Firstly, the point of the maximum equivalent stress was determined by means of the293\nfinite element (FE) method and ANSYS program (ANSYS INC. V11). Figure 11 shows the294\nmeshed model, boundary conditions and the point of maximum equivalent stress (in MPa)295\ndetermined for the mean values of tillage forces = 2.641 and = 1.106 . Then, the296\nequivalent stress, presented in Figure 12, was calculated at the point of maximum equivalent297\nstress using the finite element model, implemented in the CALFEM toolbox of MATLAB [27].298\nThe rainflow algorithm [23] was used to extract the stress cycles with their amplitude and mean299\nvalues. The histograms of stress amplitude and mean stress are shown in Figure 13. Both the300\nhistograms indicate that the dispersions of mean stress and stress amplitude are significant. This301\nreflects the high dispersions of the spatial variability in tillage forces.302\n3-3 Expected distance to failure303\nThe material constants (the regression intercept and the regression slop) used to calculated the304\nexpected distance to failure are a = 754 MPa and = 0.121. The yield stress of the material305\nis = 250 MPa. The total damage was calculated over the distance ( = 980.902 )306\naccording to Equation (17). The total damage is equal to = 1.189 \u00d7 10 . By dividing the307\ndistance by the total damage , the expected distance to failure is = 0.825 \u00d7 10 .308\nDespite the fact that the equivalent stress is smaller than the yield stress (Figure 10), the failure309\nwill occur after a certain distance . This example shows the significant effect of the spatial310\nvariability in tillage forces on the life time of tillage machines. Since agricultural soils are311\n15\ncharacterized to be high spatial variability [17], it is expected that this variability will reduce the312\nlife time of tillage tools.313\nThe expected distance to failure is plotted as a function of the shank cross-section dimensions314\n( , \u210e) in Figure 14. For all combinations of and \u210e, the equivalent stress is smaller than the yield315\nstress. The minimum distance to failure = 2.004 \u00d7 10 occurs with = 25316\nand \u210e = 55 , the maximum distance to failure = 9.213 \u00d7 10 occurs with317\n= 35 and \u210e = 70 . It is noted that the augmentation of the shank cross-section318\ndimensions increases the distance to failure. This is due to the fact that the augmentation of the319\nshank cross-section dimensions augments the resistance to failure by fatigue and by consequence320\naugments the distance to failure. The Figure 14 allows one determining the shank dimensions321\naccording to the required distance to failure, e.g., for = 10 \u00d7 10 the shank dimensions322\nare = 25 and \u210e = 65 .323\nTo investigate the effect of the percentage of the local tillage forces to the global tillage forces ( )324\non the expected distance to failure ( ), the percentage is plotted against the logarithmic scale325\nof in Figure 15. It is observed that with an increase of from 01 to 0.4, a reduction of326\nof 1.2 \u00d7 10 will take place, meaning that the reduction of due to the augmentation of is327\nvery significant. Indeed, the increase of the value of the percentage augments the amplitudes of328\nthe fatigue cycles and as a result reduces the distance to failure (Equations 15, 16 and 17).329\nTherefore, to reduce the values, (by consequence, the values of the local tillage forces) it is330\nrecommended to perform the tillage operation when the moisture content is closed to the liquid331\nlimits, where the soil conditions became most favorable for soil-working. This can improve332\nsignificantly the expected distance to failure and by consequence the life time of tillage machines.333\n334\n335\n16\n4- Conclusions336\nA new model to describe the spatial variability in tillage forces and the methods used to calculate337\nthe life time of tillage machines are presented in this paper. The proposed model was applied to338\ndetermine the spatial variability in tillage forces for the shank of a chisel plough and the expected339\ndistance to failure was caculated. The expected distance to failure for the shank cross section340\nof \u210e = 58 and = 32 was found to be = 0.825 \u00d7 10 . In addition, different values341\nof \u210e and could be used to calculate the expected distance to failure. Based on this work the342\nfollowing conclusions can be drawn:343\n\uf0b7 The spatial variability in tillage forces can be modelled by only five random parametes344\n(PHG, PVG, S1, S2, \u03c4).345\n\uf0b7 The spatial variability in tillage forces has singificant effect on the equivalent stress history.346\n\uf0b7 The dispersions of mean stress and stress amplitude of the stress cycles are important.347\n\uf0b7 The failure by fatigue will occur even the equilvalent stress is smaller than the yield stress of348\nthe material.349\n\uf0b7 The shank cross-section dimensions have a significant impact on the distance to failure350\n( = 2.004 \u00d7 10 , = 9.213 \u00d7 10 ).351\n\uf0b7 The effect of the percentage of the local tillage forces to the global tillage forces ( ) on the352\nexpected distance to failure ( ) is very significant.353\nA further research is needed to investigate the relathionships between the global and local tillage354\nforces (PHG, PVG) and the variability in the others parameters (S1, S2, \u03c4). In addition, a further355\nstudy is needed to validate the results achieved in this paper with experiment.356\n357\n358\n359\n360\n17\nReferences361\n[1] R.J.
