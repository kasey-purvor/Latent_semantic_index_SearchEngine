Underdiagnosis is common and the quality \nof life impact of symptoms may be severe. We report a study of symptom duration and quality of life before and after \ndiagnosis in a representative sample of people with diagnosed coeliac disease in the UK.\nMethods: Postal questionnaire of 2000 people with diagnosed coeliac disease, requesting information on date of \ndiagnosis, type and duration of symptoms, and quality of life before and after diagnosis using the EQ-5D instrument.\nResults: The survey response rate was 40% (788\/2000). Mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 13.2 years, \nwith some evidence of shorter duration in recent years. Respondents reported a mean of 13 consultations with their \nGP about their symptoms prior to diagnosis. The mean utility value of pre-diagnosis quality of life was 0.56, compared \nto 0.84 at time of survey, a highly statistically significant improvement of 0.27 (95% c.i. 0.25, 0.30).\nConclusions: The symptoms of undiagnosed coeliac disease are associated with a prolonged and substantial \ndecrement to quality of life. These results strengthen the case for detailed examination of the cost-effectiveness of \nimproved methods of detection and diagnosis, including population screening.\nBackground\nCoeliac disease is a common chronic autoimmune disor-\nder with a prevalence amongst adults and children\napproaching 1% of the population in international studies\n[1,2]. Underdiagnosis is common [3] and some studies\nhave reported frequent presentation with symptoms over\nmany years prior to diagnosis [4], although rates of diag-\nnosis are increasing in many countries [5]. Once diag-\nnosed, adherence to treatment involving the lifelong\nelimination of wheat, rye and barley from the diet results\nin significant clinical improvement for most patients. A\nsmall number of studies have examined the quality of life\nof coeliac patients, but these have typically focussed on\nthe quality of life of patients after diagnosis in relation to\nthe general population, and in particular on the impact of\na gluten free diet, and have relied on small samples and\ninstruments that do not facilitate comparison [6-8]. Here\nwe report on a survey of people with coeliac disease, in\nwhich information was collected on the duration and\ntypes of symptoms experienced prior to diagnosis, the\nnumber of consultations about these symptoms prior to\ndiagnosis, and quality of life before and after diagnosis\nusing for the first time in this population the EQ-5D\ninstrument, a generic utility-based instrument that is\nwidely used in surveys and favoured in technology assess-\nment as it facilitates comparison across disease areas and\nthe general population [9,10]. We focus on comparisons\nbefore and after diagnosis, but also examine whether the\nintroduction of serological testing, approximately\nbetween 1993 and 2000 [5], altered characteristics at\ndiagnosis.\nMethods\nA representative sample of 2,000 individuals was drawn\nfrom the membership list of Coeliac UK, the leading\ncharity working for people with coeliac disease and der-\nmatitis herpetiformis (DH) in the UK with a total mem-\nbership of 70,000 or 56% of the estimated 125,000 people\n* Correspondence: alastair.gray@dphpc.ox.ac.uk\n1 Health Economics Research Centre, Department of Public Health, University \nof Oxford, Old Road Campus, Oxford, UK\n\u2020 Contributed equally\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleBioMed Central\n\u00a9 2010 Gray and Papanicolas; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

A short questionnaire was designed, con-\ntaining questions on demographic characteristics, time\nsince diagnosis, type and duration of symptoms prior to\ndiagnosis, and quality of life before and after diagnosis,\nusing the EQ-5D questionnaire. Other data collected in\nthe questionnaire, for example on impact on daily activi-\nties and out-of-pocket costs associated with coeliac dis-\nease before and after diagnosis, are not reported here.\nThe symptom lists were devised based on existing litera-\nture, and revised following piloting of the questionnaire\nwith a local Coeliac UK members group. A copy of the\nquestionnaire accompanies this article [Additional file 1].\nWhere members were known to be under 18 years of\nage, the parent or guardian was asked to complete the\nquestionnaire on behalf of or with the member. The ques-\ntionnaire was publicised in the Coeliac UK Newsletter\nsent to all members, and mailed with a covering letter and\nprepaid return envelope to the sample. The sample\napproached was stratified by each country of the UK,\npostal town or county, and date of joining Coeliac UK.\nReminders to return the questionnaire were also publi-\ncised in Coeliac UK newsletters. The survey was con-\nducted in 2007.\nData were entered onto a database, and a 10% sample\nwas double-entered to check whether any coding incon-\nsistencies were concentrated in particular parts of the\nquestionnaire. These were then resolved by discussion\nand re-examination of data.\nNo imputation was conducted to deal with missing\ndata, and results are presented using complete cases for\nthe relevant question or combination of questions. T-\ntests were performed to assess whether missing cases\nwere significantly different from compete cases.\nResponses to the EQ-5D questions were given a quality\nof life valuation using the UK population tariff [11], and\nwere compared with population norms derived from a\nnational survey [12], having age- and sex-standardised to\nthe survey population. Proportions reporting no prob-\nlems before diagnosis and now in response to each EQ-\n5D question were compared using McNemar's chi-\nsquared test. Results were analysed in SPSS version 15.\u00a9\nData\n788 of 2000 questionnaires were returned, a response rate\nof just under 40%. The age and sex distribution of respon-\ndents were compared with the Coeliac UK general mem-\nbership and no statistically significant differences were\nobserved. The level of non-response varied from 2\/788\n(<0.5%) for presence of symptoms to 133\/788 (17%) for\nnumber of GP consultations prior to diagnosis.\nResults\n93% of respondents (728\/783) were the only member of\ntheir household with coeliac disease, with 7% sharing\ntheir household with at least one other person diagnosed\nwith coeliac disease.\n28% of respondents (220\/777) were male and 72% (557\/\n777) female. The mean age (SD) of respondents was 52\n(18) years, with a range from 2 to 89. 12% (97\/777) of\nrespondents were aged less than 18 years, and 10% (80\/\n777) were aged 65 or over. On average respondents were\naged 41.3 years (SD 19) when they were diagnosed with\nCD. The mean age at diagnosis was 39 (SD 18) for those\ndiagnosed before the year 2000, compared to 44 for those\ndiagnosed after 2000, a significant difference of 5 years\n(95% ci 2.7 to 8.0).\nTable 1 reports the frequency and duration of reported\nsymptoms prior to diagnosis. The most common symp-\ntoms were abdominal pain\/bloating (71%), diarrhoea\n(70%), anaemia (65%), chronic fatigue (62%), and weight\nloss (61%). 78% of respondents (605\/777) reported at least\n4 symptoms, and only 1% (6\/777) of respondents\nreported no symptoms prior to diagnosis.\nThe mean duration of specific symptoms ranged from\n12.6 years for constipation to 5.5 years for weight loss.\nThe average duration of any symptom before diagnosis\nacross the whole sample was 13.2 (SD 16.0) years. The\nduration of symptoms in those diagnosed before and\nafter the year 2000 was 14.5 and 12.0 years respectively, a\nsignificant difference of 2.5 years (95% CI 0.2. 4.9).\n655 respondents (83%) provided information about the\nnumber of times they had seen their GP about their\nsymptoms during the period prior to diagnosis, and Table\n2 reports details. On average, respondents consulted their\nGP 13.0 times about their symptoms. This was related to\nduration of symptoms: those whose symptoms had lasted\nfor less than 1 year before diagnosis consulted GPs on\naverage 4.5 times for symptom related consultations,\nwhereas those whose symptoms had lasted for 20 or more\nyears had consulted their GP on average 27.7 times for\nsymptom related consultations. The average number of\npre-diagnosis visits to GPs about symptoms was 7.0\namongst those diagnosed after the year 2000 compared to\n17.4 amongst those diagnosed before 2000, a mean differ-\nence of 10.4 visits (95% CI 2.3, 18.5). Adjusted for age of\nrespondent and duration of symptoms, this difference\nremained a statistically significant 11.4 visits (95% CI 1.9,\n20.8).\nTable 3 reports the number and percent of respondents\nat different levels of each of the 5 questions comprising\nthe EQ-5D, before and after diagnosis, and the corre-\nsponding percentages at each level in the general popula-\ntion of England.

The distribution of\nresponses from a large general population survey in Eng-\nland, age- and sex-standardised to the survey respondent\npopulation, is also shown in Table 3: across all five health\ndimensions the proportion of respondents reporting no\nproblems before diagnosis was lower than in the general\npopulation, but at time of survey was similar to or higher\nthan in the general population.\nPlacing valuations on these EQ-5D health states using\nthe British \"tariff \"11 (Table 4), the mean quality of life\nbefore diagnosis was 0.56, (where 0 = death and 1 = full\nhealth), and 0.84 at the time of the survey, indicating a\nhighly statistically significant improvement of 0.27 (95%\nc.i. 0.25, 0.30). By comparison, the average quality of life\nin the general population has been reported as 0.82 when\nage-sex-standardised to age of respondents at time of sur-\nvey response, or 0.85 when age-standardised to age of\nrespondents at age at diagnosis [12].\nOn the Visual Analogue Scale, respondents rated their\nhealth at 47% before diagnosis (0 = worst imaginable\nstate, 100 = best imaginable state), and at 79% now, a\nhighly significant improvement of 32 (95% C.I. 30, 35)\npercentage points.\nTable 1: Frequency and duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis of coeliac disease.\nSymptom: Number (%) reporting symptoms\n(of 777 respondents)\nDuration of symptoms (years)\nNumber % (95% CI) Mean (95% CI)\nAny symptom 771 99 (98, 100) 13.2 (12.1, 14.4)\nAbdominal pain\/bloating 556 71 (67, 74) 7.9 (7.0, 8.7)\nDiarrhoea 553 70 (67, 73) 6.9 (6.1, 7.8)\nAnaemia 509 65 (61, 680 11.5 (10.5, 12.6)\nChronic fatigue 488 62 (59, 650 7.1 (6.3, 7.9)\nWeight loss 479 61 (57, 640 5.5 (4.7, 6.2)\nFlatulence 368 47 (43, 50) 9.5 (8.6, 10.4)\nMouth ulcer 236 30 (27, 33) 11.2 (10.1, 12.3)\nHeadache 232 30 (26, 33) 10.3 (9.3, 11.3)\nJoint pain 220 28 (25, 31) 8.2 (7.4, 9.0)\nSkin rash 208 26 (23, 30) 9.9 (8.9, 10.9)\nConstipation 207 26 (23, 29) 12.6 (11.5, 13.6)\nDepression 185 24 (21, 27) 9.2 (8.3, 10.1)\nOther symptoms 163 21 (18, 24) 5.4 (4.8, 6.1)\nOsteoporosis 91 12 (10, 14) 7.7 (6.7, 8.6)\nAtaxia 39 5 (3, 7) 6.1 (5.2, 6.9)\nNo symptoms 6 1 (0, 2)\nTable 2: Mean number of GP consultations pre-diagnosis about symptoms, by duration of symptoms.\nNumber of consultations\nDuration of all symptoms in years: Mean N 95% CI\n>1 4.5 106 (3.5, 5.5)\n1-5 9.2 170 (4.1, 14.3)\n5-10 8.4 79 (6.1, 10.7)\n10-20 8.9 95 (6.5, 11.4)\n>20 27.7 155 (11.4, 44.1)\nTotal 13.0 605 (8.5, 17.5)\nGray and Papanicolas BMC Health Services Research 2010, 10:105\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/10\/105\nPage 4 of 7Table 3: Respondents' self-reported health on EQ-5D before diagnosis of coeliac disease (retrospective) and now: number \nand percent by level of response, and UK population norms (percent)*1.\nEQ-5D question: Level 1:\nNo problems\nLevel 2:\nSome problems\nLevel 3:\nSevere problems\nN % N % N %\nMobility:\nbefore diagnosis 524 75 159 23 14 2\nNow 602 86* 93 13 2 0\nUK population norm 78 22 0\nSelf-care:\nbefore diagnosis 648 93 35 5 14 2\nNow 673 97* 18 3 6 1\nUK population norm 93 6 0\nUsual activities:\nbefore diagnosis 403 58 249 36 45 6\nNow 574 82* 116 17 7 1\nUK population norm 78 19 3\nPain:\nbefore diagnosis 153 22 349 50 195 28\nNow 416 60* 252 36 29 4\nUK population norm 58 37 4\nAnxiety\/depression:\nbefore diagnosis 351 50 259 37 87 12\nNow 518 74* 163 23 16 2\nUK population norm 75 23 2\n*Proportion reporting no problem significantly different now compared to before diagnosis (McNemar-Bowker Chi-square test, p < 0.01)\n1 UK population norms from Health Survey for England 1996, standardised to age distribution of Coeliac UK survey respondents now.\nThere was no clear evidence that the levels of health\nreported by respondents before and after diagnosis was\nrelated to duration of symptoms.

However, all\nage groups reported a significant improvement in quality\nof life at the time of the survey compared to the period\nprior to diagnosis.\nDiscussion\nIn this study we have shown that the quality of life of peo-\nple with undiagnosed symptomatic coeliac disease is sub-\nstantially reduced compared to the general population,\nand increases markedly after diagnosis. The difference\n(0.56 prior to diagnosis (where 0 = death and 1 = full\nhealth) to 0.84 at the time of the survey), is quantitatively\nsimilar to the quality of life impact of severe events such\nas stroke [13].\nOur study found a mean duration of symptoms of 13.2\nyears; although there was some evidence that this had\nfallen since the widespread adoption of serological testing\nin the 1990s, the mean duration of symptoms of those\ndiagnosed after the year 2000 was still 12 years. These\ndurations are similar to the 11 years with symptoms prior\nto diagnosis reported in a large American study, which\nalso showed some evidence of reduced duration of symp-\nGray and Papanicolas BMC Health Services Research 2010, 10:105\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/10\/105\nPage 5 of 7\nTable 4: Respondents' self-reported health on EQ-5D before diagnosis of coeliac disease (retrospective) and now: mean \nscore on Visual Analogue Scale and mean tariff-based valuation of health state, and UK population norm1.\nMean 95% CI\nEQ-5D tariff:\npre-diagnosis 0.56 (0.54, 0.59)\ntime of survey 0.84 (0.82, 0.85)\nchange 0.27 (0.25, 0.30)\nUK population norm, standardised to age \ndistribution of respondents at:\ntime of survey 0.82 (0.81, 0.83)\ntime of diagnosis 0.85 (0.84, 0.86)\nVisual Analogue Scale:\npre-diagnosis 47% (45, 49)\ntime of survey 79% (78, 80)\nchange 32% (30, 35)\n1 UK population norms from Health Survey for England 1996, standardised to age distribution of Coeliac UK survey respondents now.\nFigure 1 Respondents' self-reported health on EQ-5D before diagnosis of coeliac disease (retrospective) and now: mean tariff-based valu-\nation of health state, by age at diagnosis.\nGray and Papanicolas BMC Health Services Research 2010, 10:105\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/10\/105\nPage 6 of 7toms following the introduction of serological testing\n[14].\nPrevious studies of quality of life associated with coeliac\ndisease have not focused on differences before and after\ndiagnosis, and have not used the EQ-5D. One advantage\nof the EQ-5D is that it is a widely used generic quality of\nlife instrument that permits comparison across many dif-\nferent disease areas, and is therefore particularly useful in\nassessing the comparative cost-effectiveness of a wide\nrange of different interventions: for this reason the EQ-\n5D is the only quality of life instrument specifically rec-\nommended for calculating quality adjusted life years by\nthe National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence in\nits recommended methods for technology appraisal [10].\nThe EQ-5D derived estimates of utility before and after\ndiagnosis reported here, and the estimated duration of\nsymptoms prior to diagnosis, may be helpful in assessing\nthe cost-effectiveness of improved methods of screening\nand detection; such studies to date have typically concen-\ntrated on cost per case detected [15], often in population\nsub-groups [16] or have specifically excluded quality of\nlife due to the prior lack of reliable estimates [17]. A sys-\ntematic review undertaken to inform the cost-effective-\nness modelling that formed part of the NICE Guidelines\non celiac disease published in 2009 was unable to find any\nutility estimates in the literature at that time [18].\nOur estimates of quality of life prior to diagnosis of coe-\nliac disease are based on retrospective assessment; such\nmethods are unavoidable in the absence of very large\nlong-term prospective studies, and have been used before\nwith different instruments and in different disease areas\n[19,20], but it is not known whether the results obtained\nwould be comparable with those derived from prospec-\ntive studies, and there is a lack of information on this with\nthe EQ-5D or indeed other instruments. Similarly,\nalthough there is no evidence that the respondents to this\nsurvey were different to non-respondents, it is possible\nthat the population from which the sample was drawn -\nmembers of Coeliac UK, stratified by area and duration of\nmembership - are in some way unrepresentative of the\nentire population of those with diagnosed coeliac disease.\nHowever, given the magnitude of the quality of life differ-\nences reported in this study, and given that the charity\nhas 56% of all diagnosed patients enrolled in its member-\nship, it seems unlikely that any recall or sampling bias\ncould seriously alter the results.\nConclusions\nThe symptoms of undiagnosed coeliac disease are associ-\nated with a prolonged and substantial decrement to qual-\nity of life. In light of these results, the case for detailed\nexamination of the cost-effectiveness of improved meth-\nods of detection and diagnosis, including population\nscreening, seems compelling.\nAdditional material\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAMG designed the study, participated in the data analysis and drafted the\nmanuscript.
