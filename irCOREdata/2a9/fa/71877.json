It then establishes a continuum of \nneoliberalism ranging from a project for radical system transformation from state \nsocialism to market capitalism, through a basic regime shift within capitalism, to more \nlimited policy adjustments intended to maintain another type of accumulation regime \nand its mode of regulation. These last two forms of neoliberalism are then related to a \nbroader typology of approaches to the restructuring, rescaling, and reordering \naccumulation and regulation in advanced capitalist societies: neoliberalism, \nneocorporatism, neostatism, and neocommunitarianism. These arguments are \nillustrated in the final part of the paper through a critique of the World Report on the \nUrban Future (1999) both as an explicit attempt to promote flanking and supporting \nmeasures to sustain the neoliberal project on the urban scale and as an implicit attempt \nto naturalise that project on a global scale. \n \nThe novelty of recent neoliberal projects lies in their discursive, strategic, and \norganizational reformulation of liberalism in response to three recent developments: the \nincreasing internationalization and\/or globalization of economies; the interconnected \ncrises of the mixed economy and the Keynesian welfare national state associated with \nAtlantic Fordism, of the guided economy and developmental state in East Asia, and of \nthe collapse of the Soviet bloc; and the rise of new social movements in response to the \neconomic, political, and social changes associated with the preceding two changes. \nAlthough neoliberal projects are being pursued on many different and often tangled \nscales, it is in cities and city-regions that the various contradictions and tensions of \n\u201cactually existing neoliberalism\u201d (Brenner and Theodore this volume) are expressed \nmost saliently in everyday life. It is also on this scale that one can find major attempts to \nmanage these contradictions and tensions in the hope of consolidating the neoliberal \n 1 \nturn through supplementary and\/or flanking strategies and policies. \n \nLiberalism and Neoliberalism \n \nLiberalism is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon. It is: a polyvalent conceptual \nensemble in economic, political, and ideological discourse; a strongly contested \nstrategic concept for restructuring market-state relations with many disputes over its \nscope, application, and limitations; and a recurrent yet historically variable pattern of \neconomic, political, and social organization in modern societies. Liberalism rarely, if \never, exists in pure form; it typically coexists with elements from other discourses, \nstrategies, and organizational patterns. Thus, it is better seen as one set of elements in \nthe repertoire of Western economic, political and ideological discourse than as a \nsingular, univocal, and internally coherent discourse in its own right. Likewise, it is better \nseen as a more or less significant principle of economic, political, and social \norganization in a broader institutional configuration than as a self-consistent, self-\nsufficient, and eternally reproducible organizational principle. Thus, the meaning and \nimport of liberalism can vary considerably. It can be a hegemonic or dominant theme in \nsome periods and movements, subaltern or subordinate in others. In addition, the actual \npractices of self-described liberal (or neoliberal) regimes may depart significantly from \nunderlying ideologies and programs. \nIdeologically, liberalism claims that economic, political, and social relations are \nbest organized through formally free1 choices of formally free and rational actors who \nseek to advance their own material or ideal interests in an institutional framework that, \nby accident or design, maximizes the scope for formally free choice. Economically, it \nendorses expansion of the market economy\u2014that is, spreading the commodity form to \nall factors of production (including labor power) and formally free, monetized exchange \nto as many social practices as possible. Politically, it implies that collective \ndecisionmaking should involve a constitutional state with limited substantive powers of \neconomic and social intervention, and a commitment to maximizing the formal freedom \nof actors in the economy and the substantive freedom of legally recognized subjects in \nthe public sphere. The latter is based in turn on spontaneous freedom of association of \n 2 \nindividuals to pursue any social activities that are not forbidden by constitutionally valid \nlaws. These three principles may conflict regarding the scope of anarchic market \nrelations, collective decisionmaking, and spontaneous self-organization as well as the \nformal and substantive freedoms available to economic, legal, and civil subjects. And, \nas Marx (1996:243) noted, \u201cWhere equal rights exist, force decides.\u201d In other words, \nwithin the matrix of liberal principles, the relative balance of economic, political, and \ncivic liberalism depends on the changing balance of forces within an institutionalized \n(but changeable) compromise. \nAs a new economic project oriented to new conditions, neoliberalism calls for: the \nliberalization and deregulation of economic transactions, not only within national borders \nbut also\u2014and more importantly\u2014across these borders; the privatization of state-owned \nenterprises and state-provided services; the use of market proxies in the residual public \nsector; and the treatment of public welfare spending as a cost of international \nproduction, rather than as a source of domestic demand (see below). As a political \nproject, it seeks to roll back \u201cnormal\u201d (or routine) forms of state intervention associated \nwith the mixed economy and the Keynesian welfare national state (or analogous forms \nof intervention in the developmental state or socialist plan state) as well as the \n\u201cexceptional\u201d (or crisis-induced) forms of intervention aimed at managing, displacing, or \ndeferring crises in and\/or of accumulation regimes and their modes of regulation in \nAtlantic Fordism, East Asia, and elsewhere. It also involves enhanced state intervention \nto roll forward new forms of governance (including state intervention) that are \npurportedly more suited to a market-driven (and, more recently, also allegedly \nknowledge-driven) globalizing economy. This typically involves the selective transfer of \nstate capacities upwards, downwards, and sideways, as intervention is rescaled in the \nhope of securing conditions for a smoothly operating world market and to promote \nsupply-side competitiveness on various scales above and below the national level. \nUrban and regional governments and growth coalitions may gain a key role as strategic \npartners of business in this changed context. A shift also occurs from government to \nmarket forces and partnership-based forms of governance, reflecting the neoliberal \nbelief in the probability, if not inevitability, of state failure and\/or the need to involve \nrelevant stakeholders in supply-side policies. And policy regimes are internationalized \n 3 \nunder the aegis of the institutions of the neo-liberal Washington Consensus promoted \nby the U.S. government and leading international economic organizations in the hope of \nharmonizing (if not standardizing) economic and social policy and their supporting \ninstitutions so that the liberal world market can work more effectively (on this and other \nreadings of the Washington Consensus, see Williamson 2000). The economic, social, \nand political measures pursued in support of the neoliberal project generally seem to \ninvolve a paradoxical increase in intervention. However, neoliberals claim this is \ntemporary and legitimate, for, after a brief transitional period, the state can retreat to its \nproper, minimal role, acting only to secure the conditions for the continued expansion of \nthe liberal market economy and a self-organizing civil society (the illusory nature of this \nclaim is illustrated by the contributions of Jones, Keil, and Peck and Tickell to this \nvolume). Finally, as a project to reorganize civil society, neoliberalism is linked to a \nwider range of political subjects than is typical of orthodox liberalism. It also tends to \npromote \u201ccommunity\u201d (or a plurality of self-organizing communities) as a flanking, \ncompensatory mechanism for the inadequacies of the market mechanism. This is yet \nanother area where cities or city-regions acquire significance in the neoliberal project, \nsince they are major sites of civic initiative as well as of the accumulating economic and \nsocial tensions associated with neoliberal projects. \nThe resurgence of liberalism in the form of neoliberalism is often attributed to a \nsuccessful hegemonic project voicing the interests of financial and\/or transnational \ncapital. Its recent hegemony in neoliberal regimes undoubtedly depends on the \nsuccessful exercise of political, intellectual, and moral leadership in response to the \ncrisis of Atlantic Fordism\u2014a crisis that the rise of neoliberalism and neoliberal policies \nhas exacerbated. However, its resonance is also rooted in the nature of capitalist social \nformations. Liberalism can be seen as a more or less \u201cspontaneous philosophy\u201d within \ncapitalist societies\u2014that is, as a seemingly natural, almost self-evident economic, \npolitical, and social imaginary that corresponds to specific features of bourgeois society. \nIn particular, it is consistent with four such features.  \nThe first of these is the institution of private property\u2014that is, the juridical fiction \nof \u201cprivate\u201d ownership and control of the factors of production. This encourages \nindividual property owners and those who dispose over fictitious commodities such as \n 4 \nlabor-power and natural resources to see themselves as entitled to use or alienate their \nproperty as they think fit, without due regard to the substantive interdependence of \nactivities in a market economy and market society. In this realm \u201crule Freedom, \nEquality, Property and Bentham, because both buyer and seller of a commodity, say of \nlabor-power, are constrained only by their own free will\u201d (Marx 1996:186). Second, and \nrelatedly, there is the appearance of \u201cfree choice\u201d in consumption, where those with \nsufficient money choose what to buy and how to dispose over it. Third, the institutional \nseparation and operational autonomies of the economy and state make the latter\u2019s \ninterventions appear as external intrusions into the activities of otherwise free economic \nagents. This may initially be an unwelcome but necessary extraeconomic condition for \norderly free markets, but if pushed beyond this minimum night-watchman role it appears \nas an obstacle to free markets and\/or as direct political oppression. Fourth, there is the \nclosely related institutional separation of civil society and the state. This encourages the \nbelief that state intervention is an intrusion into the formally free choices of particular \nmembers of civil society once the conditions for social order have been established.  \nOpposition to liberalism may also emerge \u201cspontaneously\u201d on the basis of four \nother features of capitalist social relations that are closely related to the former set. \nFirst, growing socialization of the forces of production despite continued private \nownership of the means of production suggests the need for ex ante collaboration \namong producer groups to limit market anarchy, through top-down planning and\/or \nvarious forms of self-organization. Second, there are the strategic dilemmas posed by \nthe shared interests of producers (including wage-earners) in maximizing total revenues \nthrough cooperation and their divided and potentially conflictual interests over how \nthese revenues are distributed. Various nonmarket governance mechanisms have a \nrole here helping to balance cooperation and conflict. Third, there are the contradictions \nand conflicts posed by the coexistence of the institutional separation and mutual \ndependence of the economic and state systems. This leads to different logics of \neconomic and political action, at the same time as it generates a need to consult on the \neconomic impact of state policies and\/or on the political repercussions of private \neconomic decisionmaking. And fourth, there are problems generated by the nature of \ncivil society as a sphere of particular interests opposed to the state\u2019s supposed \n 5 \nembodiment of universal interests. This indicates the need for some institutional means \nof mediating the particular and universal and, since this is impossible in the abstract, for \nsome hegemonic definition of the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d (on the always imperfect, \nstrategically selective nature of such reconciliations, see Jessop 1990). \nThis suggests that, if liberalism can be interpreted as a more or less \n\u201cspontaneous philosophy\u201d rooted in capitalist social relations, one should also recognize \nthat it is prone to \u201cspontaneous combustion\u201d due to tensions inherent in these same \nrelations. This was noted in Polanyi\u2019s critique of late nineteenth-century liberalism, \nwhich argued that, in response to crisis-tendencies in laissez-faire capitalism, many \nsocial forces struggled to re-embed and re-regulate the market. The eventual \ncompromise solution was a market economy embedded in and sustained by a market \nsociety (Polanyi 1944). The same point applies to neoliberal capitalism. Thus, after the \nefforts of \u201croll-back neoliberalism\u201d (Peck and Tickell this volume) to free the neoliberal \nmarket economy from its various corporatist and statist impediments, attempts are now \nbeing made to secure its medium-term viability by embedding it in a neoliberal market \nsociety. This involves measures to displace or defer contradictions and conflicts beyond \nthe spatiotemporal horizons of a given regime, as well as supplementary measures to \nflank, support, and sustain the continued dominance of the neoliberal project within \nthese horizons (on the key concept of \u201cspatiotemporal fix\u201d in this regard, see Jessop \n2001). \nThis line of argument should not be restricted to liberalism and neoliberalism, for \nthe other modes of governance characteristic of capitalist social formations are also \ncontradictory and tension-ridden. Indeed, there are strange complementarities here. On \nthe one hand, while liberalism tends to regenerate itself \u201cspontaneously\u201d on the basis of \nkey features of capitalist societies, this regeneration meets obstacles from some of the \nother key features of such societies. On the other hand, while the latter provide the \nbasis for the resurgence of other discourses, strategies, and organizational paradigms, \nsuch as corporatism or statism, their realization tends to be fettered in turn by the \nfeatures that generate liberalism. Overall, these mutually related tendencies and \ncountertendencies produce oscillations in the relative weight of different kinds of co-\nordination and modes of policymaking.  \n 6 \nThis said, different principles of governance seem more or less well suited to \ndifferent stages of capitalism and\/or its contemporary variants. Thus, liberalism was \nprobably more suited to the pioneering forms of competitive capitalism than to later \nforms\u2014though Polanyi and others would note that it has clear limitations even for \ncompetitive capitalism\u2014and it is more suited to uncoordinated than coordinated market \neconomies, for which statism and corporatism are better (see Coates 2000; Hall and \nSoskice 2001; Huber and Stephens 2001). Thus, different stages and forms of \ncapitalism may have distinctive institutional attractors (or centres of gravity) around \nwhich oscillation occurs. This makes it imperative to study \u201cactually existing \nneoliberalisms\u201d to understand how their dynamic and viability are shaped by specific \npath-dependent contexts, competing discourses, strategies, and organizational \nparadigms, and the balance of forces associated with different projects.  \n \nThe Neoliberal Turn and Its Implications  \n \nThe initial rise of neoliberalism as a wide-ranging economic and political strategy was \nassociated with the neoliberal regime shift in Britain and the US in the late 1970s. This \nreflects the fact that their uncoordinated market economies were less well equipped \norganizationally and institutionally than were coordinated economies to manage the \ncrisis-tendences of Atlantic Fordism, and that they provided more fertile ground for the \nrise of neoliberalism. This was followed by similar shifts in Canada, New Zealand, and \nAustralia, with New Zealand showing, in many ways, the least impure form of \nneoliberalism. An increasing number of coordinated economies (including the so-called \n\u201cRhenish\u201d cases and the social democratic economies of Scandinavia) initiated \nneoliberal policy adjustments during the 1980s and continued them into the 1990s. \nThen, with the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989\u20131990, Western neoliberal forces and \ninternational institutions under US leadership (with strong British backing) launched their \nprogram for a neoliberal system transformation for the postsocialist economies in \nEastern and Central Europe, with rather equivocal (or cynically opportunistic) support \nfrom domestic nomenklatura capitalists. Given the political, intellectual, and moral \nclimate from the late 1970s to early 1990s and the dominance\u2014if not hegemony\u2014of a \n 7 \ntransatlantic neoliberal power bloc, such disparate sets of changes were often lumped \ntogether and misinterpreted (enthusiastically or despairingly) as proof of the general \ntriumph of neoliberalism. (See Table 1 for these different degrees or forms of \nneoliberalism.)  \nHowever, this impression was seriously misleading, since it failed to distinguish \nthe different forms and degrees of neoliberalism, even in this heady period, and ignored \nthe extent to which each of its three types was subject to challenge and prone to failure. \nThus, major alternatives to neoliberal system transformation were already being \npromoted in the 1990s. These included Germany\u2019s attempt to mould postsocialism by \nintegrating its eastern neighbors and the Balkans into an expanded German economic \nbloc reminiscent in scope (but not methods of coordination) of the fascist \nGro\u00dfraumwirtschaft (large space economy), and Sweden\u2019s efforts to extend its social \ndemocratic model into the postsocialist societies and create a Baltic Sea economic \nregion. Moreover, outside Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, the \nmuch-hyped transformation increasingly took the form of a parasitic nomenklatura \ncapitalism presiding over a generalised economic collapse. Meanwhile, capitalist \nsocieties undertaking a neoliberal regime shift also began to face problems in the 1990s \nwith their pursuit of pure market forces and promoted a \u201cThird Way\u201d to support and flank \ntheir own neoliberal projects. This is the significance of Major (and then Blair) in Britain \nand of Clinton in the USA (on New Labor\u2019s urban policy in this respect, see Jones and \nWard\u2019s contribution to this volume).  \nConversely, those economies that embarked on neoliberal policy adjustment \nrarely moved on to a neoliberal regime shift. Indeed, attempts to do so were rejected by \nelectors and\/or opposed by leading economic and political forces with vested interests \nin maintaining the prevailing production regimes. Here, adjustment took the form of \nrolling back the exceptional (or crisis-induced) aspects of state intervention that had \nbeen introduced to displace or defer Atlantic Fordism\u2019s crisis-tendencies in favor of \nneoliberal measures to reduce inflation and government deficits. However, there has \nbeen no comparable roll-back of the normal (routine) forms of intervention associated \nwith the postwar mode of growth. Instead, they have been modified to promote greater \nflexibility and innovation and to reinforce the welfare state\u2019s role in aiding adjustment to \n 8 \nglobal pressures in small open economies. This is reflected in the greater continuity in \ninstitutions and modes of policymaking, even as distinctive national variants of a new \nmode of regulation are emerging with a mix of neostatist, neocorporatist, and some \nneoliberal features (see below). \n \nLooking Beyond Neoliberalism to Interpret Recent Changes \nIf the above account is correct, one should not conflate the global neoliberal turn with \nthe broader set of recent changes in economic, political, and social life. For, although \nthe rise of neoliberal discourse and the pursuit of neoliberal strategies has helped to \nshape the form and content of these changes, the latter have more general (and \ndeeper) roots in the broader political economy of Atlantic Fordism and its articulation \nwith the wider world system and have also prompted responses quite different from the \nattempt to establish a global neoliberal market economy. Various labels have been \nproposed by different theoretical approaches to describe these changes, and no single \napproach could hope to capture them in all their complexity. This is certainly not my aim \nhere. Instead I want to explore the value of a state-theoretical regulationist approach to \nsome changes that affect capital accumulation and its regulation in North America, \nEurope, and Australasia. In particular, I suggest that these changes can be analyzed in \nterms of the Schumpeterian Workfare Postnational Regime (or SWPR). \nThis regime has four key features that distinguish it in ideal-typical terms from the \nKeynesian Welfare National State (or KWNS). First, it seeks to promote international \ncompetitiveness and sociotechnical innovation through supply-side policies in relatively \nopen economies. Thus, with Keynes\u2019s symbolic dethronement, today\u2019s emblematic \neconomist is Schumpeter, the theorist of innovation, enterprise, long waves of \ntechnological change, and creative destruction (on this last aspect, see Brenner and \nTheodore in this issue). The economic policy emphasis now falls on innovation and \ncompetitiveness, rather than on full employment and planning. Second, social policy is \nbeing subordinated to economic policy, so that labor markets become more flexible and \ndownward pressure is placed on a social wage that is now considered as a cost of \nproduction rather than a means of redistribution and social cohesion. In general, the aim \nhere is to get people from welfare into work, rather than resort to allegedly \n 9 \nunsustainable welfare expenditures, and, in addition, to create enterprising subjects and \noverturn a culture of dependency. Third, the importance of the national scale of \npolicymaking and implementation is being seriously challenged, as local, regional, and \nsupranational levels of government and social partnership gain new powers. This is \nreflected in the concern to find creative \u201cpostnational\u201d solutions to current economic, \npolitical, social, and environmental problems, rather than relying primarily on national \ninstitutions and networks. The urban level is important here for economic and social \npolicy. And, fourth, there is growing reliance on partnership, networks, consultation, \nnegotiation, and other forms of reflexive self-organization, rather than on the \ncombination of anarchic market forces and top-down planning associated with the \npostwar \u201cmixed economy\u201d or on the old tripartite corporatist arrangements based on a \nproducers\u2019 alliance between big business, big labor, and the national state.  \nThere are various forms of the SWPR, different routes can be taken towards \nthem, and there are significant path-dependent as well as path-shaping aspects to \ntrajectories and outcomes alike. A neoliberal regime shift is only one of many \npossibilities. To facilitate a comparative analysis of \u201cactually existing\u201d neoliberalization \n(Peck and Tickell this volume), it is useful to contrast neoliberalism with three other \nideal-typical strategies that can lead from some form of the KWNS to some form of the \nSWPR: neocorporatism, neostatism, and neocommunitarianism. Before elaborating on \nthese particular concepts in more detail, however, I will explain the general theoretical \npurposes of ideal types and their possible role(s) in empirical analysis. \nIdeal types are so called because they involve thought experiments, not because \nthey represent some normative ideal or other. They are theoretical constructs formed by \nthe one-sided accentuation of empirically observable features of social reality to \nproduce logically coherent and objectively feasible configurations of social relations. \nThese configurations are never found in pure form, but their conceptual construction \nmay still be useful for heuristic, descriptive, and explanatory purposes. The four variants \nof the SWPR are constructed around six interdependent, partly overlapping aspects of \neconomic regulation. These comprise: the dominant form of competition; the form and \nextent of external regulation of private economic actors; the size of the public sector; the \nform and extent of state-owned production of goods and services; the articulation \n 10 \nbetween national economies and the state\u2019s role in managing international economic \nrelations; and the tax regime. However, given this interdependence and overlap, the six \nfeatures listed for each ideal type are not exactly equivalent. Seeking complete \nequivalence would privilege one type (probably neoliberalism) as the benchmark for \ncomparison and so risk losing sense what gives each type its own distinctive \ncoherence. The prefix \u201cneo\u201d highlights important discontinuities with the liberal, \ncorporatist, and statist variants of the KWNS linked to Fordism and\/or their \ncontemporary communitarian alternatives. While specific economic, political, and \nintellectual forces are often closely identified with one or other response, the types are \nbest seen as poles around which different solutions could develop. Each has \ncontrasting implications for economic and social policy. Individual mixes depend on \ninstitutional legacies, the balance of political forces, and the changing economic and \npolitical conjunctures in which different strategies are pursued. The four types are \npresented in summary in Table 2 and elaborated in the following paragraphs. \nNeoliberalism promotes market-led economic and social restructuring. In the \npublic sector, this involves privatization, liberalization, and imposition of commercial \ncriteria in the residual state sector; in the private sector, deregulation is backed by a \nnew juridicopolitical framework that offers passive support for market solutions. This is \nreflected in: government measures to promote \u201chire-and-fire,\u201d flexitime, and flexiwage \nlabor markets; growth of tax expenditures steered by private initiatives based on fiscal \nsubsidies for favored economic activities; measures to turn welfare states into means of \nsupporting and subsidizing low wages and\/or to enhance the disciplinary force of social \nsecurity measures and programs; and a more general reorientation of economic and \nsocial policy to the private sector\u2019s \u201cneeds.\u201d In addition, social partnership is disavowed \nin favor of managerial prerogatives, market forces, and a strong state. Neoliberals also \nsupport free trade and capital mobility. They expect innovation to follow spontaneously \nfrom freeing entrepreneurs and workers to seize market opportunities in a state-\nsponsored enterprise culture.  \nNeocorporatism involves a negotiated approach to restructuring by private, \npublic, and third-sector actors and aims to balance competition and cooperation. It is \nbased on commitment to social accords as well as the pursuit of private economic \n 11 \ninterests in securing the stability of a socially embedded, socially regulated economy. \nHowever, whilst Atlantic Fordist corporatism involved cooperation between big \nbusiness, mass unions, and an interventionist state to promote full employment and \novercome stagflation, neocorporatism reflects the diversity of policy communities and \nnetworks relevant to innovation-driven growth, as well as the increasing heterogeneity \nof labor forces and labor markets. It is also more directly and explicitly oriented to \ninnovation and competitiveness. Thus, neocorporatist networks include policy \ncommunities representing functional systems (eg science, health, and education), and \npolicy implementation becomes more flexible through the extension of \u201cregulated self-\nregulation\u201d and public-private partnerships. Compliance with state policies is voluntary \nor depends on self-regulating corporatist organizations endowed with public status. \nAnd\u2014whether at local, national, or supranational level\u2014states use their resources to \nsupport decisions reached through corporatist negotiation. Corporatist arrangements \nmay also become more selective (eg excluding some entrenched industrial interests \nand marginal workers, integrating some \u201csunrise\u201d sectors and privileging core workers); \nand, reflecting the greater flexibility and decentralization of the post-Fordist economy, \nthe centers of neocorporatist gravity shifts to firms and localities and away from \ncentralized macroeconomic concertation.  \nNeostatism involves a market-conforming but state-sponsored approach to \neconomic and social restructuring whereby the state seeks to guide market forces in \nsupport of a national economic strategy. This guidance depends heavily on the state\u2019s \ndeployment of its own powers of imperative co-ordination, its own economic resources \nand activities, and its own knowledge bases and organizational intelligence. Compared \nwith the statist form of the KWNS, however, there is a changed understanding of \ninternational competition. This is a Schumpeterian view based on dynamic competitive \nadvantage rather than Ricardian static comparative advantage or Listian dynamic \ngrowth based on catch-up investment in a protected, mercantilist economy. There is a \nmixture of state-driven decommodification, state-sponsored flexibility, and other state \nactivities to secure the dynamic efficiency and synergistic coherence of a core \nproductive economy. This is reflected in an active structural policy that sets strategic \ntargets relating to new technologies, technology transfer, innovation systems, \n 12 \ninfrastructure, and other factors affecting international competitiveness broadly \nunderstood. The state also favours an active labor market policy to re-skill labor power \nand encourages a flexiskill rather than flexiprice labor market. It guides private-public \npartnerships to ensure that they serve public as well as private interests. Whilst the \ncentral state retains key strategic roles, parallel and complementary activities are also \nencouraged at regional and\/or local levels. However, the central state\u2019s desire to protect \nthe core technological and economic competencies of its productive base is often \nassociated with neomercantilism at the supranational level. \nNeocommunitarianism is a fourth approach to building an SWPR. It emphasizes \nthe contribution of the \u201cthird sector\u201d and\/or the \u201csocial economy\u201d (both located between \nmarket and state) to economic development and social cohesion, as well as the role of \ngrassroots (or bottom-up) economic and social mobilization in developing and \nimplementing economic strategies. It also emphasizes: the link between economic and \ncommunity development, notably in empowering citizens and community groups; the \ncontribution that greater self-sufficiency can make to reinserting marginalized local \neconomies into the wider economy: and the role of decentralized partnerships that \nembrace not only the state and business interests but also diverse community \norganizations and other local stakeholders. The neocommunitarian strategy focuses on \nless competitive economic spaces (such as inner cities, deindustrializing cities, or cities \nat the bottom of urban hierarchies) with the greatest risk of losing from the zero-sum \ncompetition for external resources. Against the logic of a globalizing capitalism, the \nsocial economy prioritizes social use-value. It aims to redress the imbalance between \nprivate affluence and public poverty, to create local demand, to re-skill the long-term \nunemployed and reintegrate them into an expanded labor market, to address some of \nthe problems of urban regeneration (eg in social housing, insulation, and energy-\nsaving), to provide a different kind of spatiotemporal fix for small and medium-sized \nenterprises, to regenerate trust within the community, and to promote empowerment. \nThis involves co-ordinated economic and social strategies across various scales of \naction and, ideally, a minimum income guarantee\u2014whether as citizens\u2019 wage, basic \nincome, or carers\u2019 allowances. \nThe changes associated with these different strategies typically involve some \n 13 \nrescaling of the mode of economic regulation. Nonetheless, different strategies may be \npursued on different scales. For example, a retreat of state intervention at the national \nlevel may be linked to its rolling forward at local or supranational levels (cf Gough and \nEisenschitz 1996). This has obvious implications for the urban level, where key issues \nof competitiveness, labor market flexibility, and social policy intersect, and where new \nsupply-side orientations may permit differential economic and social policies and \nperhaps\u2014notably under neoliberalism\u2014encourage uneven development. Thus, even \nwhere both the national and international levels are dominated by attempts to promote a \nneoliberal regime shift, the urban level may be characterized more by neocorporatism, \nneostatism, and neocommunitarianism. Indeed this last pattern is particularly linked to \nattempts to manage issues of social exclusion and social cohesion at the urban level \neven in the most strongly neoliberal cases. The resurgence\u2014or (in southern Europe) \nthe emergence\u2014of \u201csocial pacts\u201d in European Union member states also reflects the \nmultiscalar nature of the changing world economy and its repercussions on national \neconomic and social policy (on social pacts, see Ebbinghaus and Hassel 1999; Grote \nand Schmitter 1999; Regini 2000; and Rhodes 1998). Overall, this requires attention to \nhow these four alternative approaches to post-Fordist restructuring are combined in \n\u201cactually existing\u201d strategies or projects and, in particular, how different approaches may \nacquire different weights at different scales within the same strategy or project. There is \ncertainly no good reason to expect the same broad approach to dominate at all levels, \nand there are several good reasons why more complex and complicated pictures might \nemerge. \n \nNeoliberalism and Cities  \nSome of the implications of neoliberalism for cities (and some of the above-noted \ncomplications) can be discerned in a recent report entitled World Report on the Urban \nFuture 21 (World Report 2000). This is a specially prepared report that was written by a \ndistinguished fourteen-member \u201cWorld Commission\u201d moderated by Sir Peter Hall, the \nrenowned professor of urban planning, and serviced by Ulrich Pfeiffer, a professional \nurban planning consultant, for Urban21. Urban21 was a prestigious international \nconference held in Berlin in June 2000, sponsored by the German government, with \n 14 \nadditional support from the governments of Brazil, South Africa, and Singapore. The \nworld commissioners who prepared the report are drawn from \u201cthe great and the good\u201d \nand have been involved in a range of public, parastatal, professional, and private \nactivities. Allowing for some overlap in experience and positions, they included: \nacademic policy entrepreneurs, mayors, an ambassador, a vice president and ex\u2013vice \npresident of the World Bank, a senior civil servant, architects, jurists, ministers, senior \nUN officials, former parliamentary deputies, and leaders of national and international \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Sponsors of some of the conference symposia \nincluded international producer service firms, a major software house, a construction \nfirm, and a major German regional bank. Whilst no single report should be taken as \nwholly representative of current thinking on urban governance, this one does provide \nsome useful insights into the naturalization of neoliberalism and its implications for \nsustainable cities in an era of the globalizing, knowledge-driven economy. It has since \nbeen published in book form as Hall and Pfeiffer (2000).2 \nAll four of the above-noted distinctive features of the SWPR are clearly \ndiscernible in the World Report, even though they are not fully examined. Of special \ninterest for present purposes is how these features are related to cities and their future. \nFirst, cities are clearly regarded as engines of economic growth, key centers of \neconomic, political, and social innovation, and key actors in promoting and consolidating \ninternational competitiveness. Moreover, with the transition to a postindustrial era, the \nrise of the knowledge-driven economy, and the increasing importance of the information \nsociety with its requirements for lifelong learning, cities are seen as even more \nimportant drivers for innovation and competitiveness than before. Admittedly, the \nauthors identify different types of cities\u2014based on informal hypergrowth, based on \ndynamic innovation and learning, or the declining cities of an outmoded Fordist model of \ngrowth\u2014and recommend different responses for each. However, these represent \ndifferent adaptations of the overall neoliberal program to the same set of challenges. \nSecond, in line with the familiar neoliberal critique, welfare states are seen as \ncostly, overburdened, inefficient, incapable of eliminating poverty, overly oriented to \ncash entitlements rather than empowerment, and so on. The report argues that, where it \nalready exists, the welfare state should be dismantled in favor of policies that \n 15 \nemphasize moving people from welfare into work, that link social and labor market \npolicy, and that provide incentives to learn and\/or prepare for a new job. Likewise, \nwhere they have not yet developed, welfare states should be firmly discouraged. \nInstead, arrangements should be instituted to encourage family, neighborhood, informal, \nor market-based and market-sustaining solutions to the problems of social reproduction. \nStates should not attempt to provide monopoly services but should contract them out or \nat least introduce internal competition. In hypergrowth cities, for example, this translates \ninto a call to revalorize the informal economy and\/or the social economy and \nneighborhood support mechanisms as a means of tackling social exclusion. In more \ndynamic or mature cities, the report (2000) recommends other projects to produce \n\u201cactive and productive citizens\u201d who will not burden the state or demand entitlements \nwithout accepting corresponding responsibilities. Thus, education and informal self-help \nare the key to survival and sustainability and, in principle, education should be made \navailable to all. Cities should develop their stock of indigenous \u201chuman capital\u201d and their \nlocal labor markets in order to promote local well-being as well as international \ncompetitiveness. \nThird, the World Report clearly recognizes the emerging crisis of the national \nscale of economic, political, and social organization, the increased importance of the \nglobal level (especially in the form of a still emerging \u201csingle global urban network\u201d that \ncross-cuts national borders), and the resurgence of the local and regional levels. Its \nresponse is to promote the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity. Problems should be \nresolved at the lowest level possible, but with capacity-building and financial support \nfrom the national administration. This requires integrated action between various levels \nof government, with an appropriate allocation of responsibilities and resources. \nUnsurprisingly, the report envisages a key role for cities in managing the interface \nbetween the local economy and global flows, between the potentially conflicting \ndemands of local sustainability and local well-being and those of international \ncompetitiveness, and between the challenges of social exclusion and global polarization \nand the continuing demands for liberalization, deregulation, privatization, and so on.  \nFourth, there is a strong emphasis on partnership and networks rather than top-\ndown national government. Thus, in addition to subsidiarity and solidarity across \n 16 \ndifferent scales of economic, political, and social organization, the report also calls for \npartnership between the public and private sectors and between government and civil \nsociety. Public-private partnerships should nonetheless work with the grain of market \nforces, not against it. In addition, partnerships should involve not only actors from the \nprivate economic sector but also NGOs, religious groups, community-action groups, or \nnetworks among individuals. Promoting partnerships requires a retreat of the state \n(especially at national level) so that it can do well what it alone can do. Nonetheless, the \nlatter tasks do include steering partnerships and moderating their mutual relations in the \ninterests of \u201cthe maximum welfare of all the people.\u201d This is reflected in the World \nReport\u2019s (2000) call for \u201cgood governance, seen as an integrated effort on the part of \nlocal government, civil society and the private sector.\u201d  \nIn noting how the World Report fits in with the neoliberal project, I am not arguing \nthat its principal authors, the commissioners, their professional, academic, and lay \nconsultants, or the principal speakers at the Urban21 conference are necessarily \nconscious agents of neoliberalism in either its initial \u201cred in tooth and claw\u201d version or its \ncurrent \u201cThird Way\u201d variant. Some may be; others are not. More important for my \npurposes is how this document implicitly endorses neoliberalism in the ways it describes \nrecent economic and political changes, ascribes responsibility for them, and prescribes \nsolutions for the problems they create. In this sense, it is a deeply ideological document \nand contributes to the \u201cNew World Order\u201d by sharing in a \u201cnew word order\u201d  (Luke 1994: \n613-615). For ideology is most effective when ideological elements are invisible, \noperating as the background assumptions which lead the text producer to \u201ctextualize\u201d \nthe world in a particular way and lead interpreters to interpret the text in a particular way \n(Fairclough 1989:85). \nIndeed, alongside its diagnosis of the various failures of previous modes of \neconomic growth and urban governance in different types of city, said in each case to \njustify neoliberalism, the World Report (2000) recognizes that neoliberalism has its own \nlimits and also generates major social tensions. Its authors accept the recently \nperceived need to re-embed neoliberalism in society, to make it more acceptable \nsocially and politically, and to ensure that it is environmentally sustainable. Here, \nPolanyi lives! Yet they make as few concessions as possible to the forces that oppose \n 17 \nthe program, protagonists, and driving forces of neoliberalism. Hence, the World Report \nalso identifies and advocates different sets of strategies to support and complement the \nneoliberal project in different regions and\/or types of cities. Its proposals for the \ninformal, weakly regulated, and vulnerable hypergrowth cities of the developing world \ncombine neoliberalism with a strong emphasis on mobilizing popular energies, the \ninformal or social economy, and communitarian values. In these cities, then, it ascribes \na key role to neocommunitarianism in sustaining neoliberalism. In contrast, no such \ndilution is recommended for the mature but declining cities of the Atlantic Fordist \nregions: they must take their neoliberal medicine. A different prescription again is \noffered for the dynamic cities of East Asia. This comprises a mix of neoliberalism with \npublic-private partnerships to improve the infrastructure and policy environment for \ninternational as well as local capital. Here the developmental state is allowed to remain \nproactive, provided that it is rescaled and becomes more open to world-market forces. \nIn no case is there a challenge to the wisdom of the \u201caccumulated knowledge and \nexperience\u201d noted by the World Report that market forces provide the best means to \nsatisfy human wants and desires and that, provided they are steered in the right \ndirection through good governance, they can also solve the most pressing problems \nfacing humankind in the new century. \n \nNaturalizing Neoliberalism \nThe World Report (2000) also illustrates another key feature of neoliberalism. The \nlatter\u2019s success depends on promoting new ways of representing the world, new \ndiscourses, new subjectivities that establish the legitimacy of the market economy, the \ndisciplinary state, and enterprise culture. The language of the World Report shares in \nthis tendency to naturalize the global neoliberal project, most notably in its concern with \nrenewing and consolidating neoliberal principles at the urban scale. Thus, the many \nchanges associated with this project are variously represented in the World Report as \nnatural, spontaneous, inevitable, technological, and demographic. It takes technological \nchange and globalization as given, depersonalizes them, fetishizes market forces, and \nfails to mention the economic, political, and social forces that drive these processes.  \nMoreover, the very same processes that cause the problems identified in the \n 18 \nreport will also solve them: technological change will provide solutions to emerging \nproblems, democratization will occur, population growth will decline, economic growth \nwill continue, the informal sector will expand to deal with social problems. No one could \ninfer from the report that technological change and globalization are deeply politicized \nprocesses and objects of struggles within the dominant classes, within states, and \nwithin civil society. Instead, it presumes an equality of position in relation to these \nchanges: they are objective and inevitable, we must adapt to them. Thus, whereas \nglobalization, technological change, and competition are depersonalized, human \nagency enters in through the need for survival and sustainability. It is, above all, local \ncommunities, women, and workers who must adapt to these impersonal forces. They \nmust be flexible, empower themselves, take control of their pensions by self-funding \nthem, undertake lifelong learning, put democratic pressure on urban administrations to \nsupport their informal initiatives, and so on. Likewise, cities can become competitive, \ntake control of their economic destinies, develop their local markets, especially the \nlocalized labor markets, their local infrastructure and their stock of housing, develop \ngood governance, and become attractive places for working and living. Moreover, on \nthe rare occasions where blame is attributed for economic and social problems, it tends \nto be localized. Thus, urban poverty results not so much from capitalism as from \nineffective local administration\u2014which a judicious combination of mobilization from \nbelow and capacity-building from above can correct. \nThe World Report (2000) contains no analysis of capitalism and its agents. The \ndynamic of the knowledge-driven economy is described in objective, factual terms. The \nreport contains only one reference to \u201cthe present economic system\u201d (undefined), and \nthis admits that it is massively suboptimal and inefficient\u2014but does not pause to ask why. \nThe only economic actors it identifies are local urban networks of small-scale producers \nand service, small firms, private companies, and (clearly benign) \u201cworld-class \ncompanies.\u201d The only capital identified is human capital. The only social actors are: \npeople around the world with shared or common aspirations; the weak, the old, and the \nyoung; the rich and the poor; women; families; informal neighborhood support networks; \nand members of civil society. The only political actors mentioned are urban leaders, \ncitizens, and city administrations. There is no reference at all to the economic, political, \n 19 \nor ideological roles of multinational companies, transnational banks, strategic alliances \namong giant companies, the military-industrial complex, an emerging transnational \nclass, the World Economic Forum, or the overall dynamic of capitalism. There is no \nreference to popular movements, new social movements, grass-roots struggles, trade \nunions, or even political parties\u2014good governance is, apparently, above party politics. \nAlso unmentioned are the crucial roles of the International Monetary Fund, the World \nBank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Trade \nOrganization, and other international economic agencies; and the efforts of the US and \nits allies to promote globalization or redesign political and social institutions to \nunderwrite and complement neoliberalism. Presumably, these must be left to operate \nabove the national level (at which ultimate responsibility for social justice and \nredistribution is apparently to be located) and to define (technocratically) the framework \nwithin which cities pursue sustainable development. Pollution and environmental \ndestruction appear to be facts of nature, rather than products of specific sets of social \nrelations. The empowerment of women appears to be a key mechanism of social \ntransformation, but patriarchy figures nowhere as a mechanism of domination or \noppression\u2014and neither states nor firms, neither political nor business leaders, seem to \nhave vested interests in sustaining it. \nIn short, here is a text that simulates egalitarianism (that of a \u201cwe,\u201d a collectivity \nof individuals, families, and communities all equally confronted with objective, inevitable \nchanges and challenges) and lacks any explicit reference to power and authority, \nexploitation and domination. It is no surprise, then, that these challenges can be met in \nways that will reconcile international competitiveness with local autonomy, economic \ngrowth with sustainability, market forces with quality of life, the needs of the highly \nskilled with the economic development of the entire city. This harmonization of \ncontradictions and antagonisms is to be achieved at the urban level through a rallying of \nthe good and the great, the movers and shakers, the rich and the poor, shanty dwellers \nand property capital, men and women, to the banner of \u201cgood governance.\u201d And that \nthey will so rally is, it appears, assured through the same \u201caccumulated knowledge and \nexperience\u201d that has recognized the virtues of multidimensional sustainable development. \nAdequate forms of urban governance are thus central to securing the neoliberal project as \n 20 \nit is pursued in different forms and to different degrees in different local, regional, national, \nand transnational contexts. \n \nConclusion \nThis sort of search for a new spatiotemporal fix for neoliberalism is unsurprising, for \nattempts to spread the neoliberal economic project globally have experienced major \nsetbacks in recent years. This is especially clear in the massive failure of the militant \nfree-marketeers\u2019 initial neoliberal project to promote radical system transformation in \npostsocialist societies. Despite a very steep learning curve and substantial foreign \nsupport, there is still no successful paradigmatically neoliberal regime in the ex-Soviet \nbloc. Likewise, in the case of the attempt to impose neoliberal regime shifts in East Asia \nand Latin America, failure is evident in unexpected financial and industrial crises and a \nfinancial contagion that threatened to spread through an increasingly integrated world \nmarket. In the neoliberal regime shifts in the former heartlands of Atlantic Fordism, \nfailure can be seen in unexpected social costs with serious political repercussions, such \nas growing economic polarization and social exclusion rather than the promised \u201ctrickle-\ndown\u201d effects of liberated market forces. In addition, countries that embarked on \nneoliberal policy adjustment did not move on to a neoliberal regime shift, but instead \nsought alternative paths of economic, social, and political restructuring. More generally, \nnew forms of resistance have developed on a global scale (eg the Multilateral \nAgreement on Investments, Seattle, Genoa). \nAlthough such setbacks have not triggered a major reversal of the global \nneoliberal project, they have led many key protagonists to re-evaluate strategies and \ntactics. This explains the growing concern with how best to present the project, to co-\nordinate actions to promote and consolidate it on different scales, to manage its social \nand environmental costs and their adverse political repercussions, and to identify and \npursue flanking measures that would help to re-embed the recently liberated market \nforces into a well-functioning market society. If getting the international institutional \narchitecture and international regimes right is one key aspect of attempts to stabilize \nneoliberalism, intervention at the urban scale is equally essential, because this is where \nneoliberalism has its most significant economic, political, and social impacts on \n 21 \neveryday life. Whether or not such projects will succeed is another matter. I have \nalready advanced some general reasons why the various modes of governance \nassociated with capitalism all tend to encounter contradictions, tensions, and obstacles. \nOnly time and struggles will tell whether sufficient flanking and supporting measures can \nbe introduced to stabilize neoliberalism as the basis for regulation of a glocalized \nknowledge-driven economy. \n  \n \n 22 \nAcknowledgments \nThis paper has benefited from discussions with Neil Brenner, Gordon MacLeod, Martin \nJones, Jamie Peck, Adam Tickell, and Nick Theodore, comments by other participants \nin the \u201cNeoliberalism and the City\u201d conference at the University of Illinois in Chicago, \nSeptember 2001, and the suggestions of three Antipode referees.
