We have examined several cases of magneto-\nsphere compression by solar wind pressure pulses using a\nset of instruments located in the noon sector of auroral zone.\nWe have found that the increase in riometric absorption (sud-\nden commencement absorption, SCA) occurred simultane-\nously with the beginning of negative or positive magnetic\nvariations and broadband enhancement of magnetic activity\nin the frequency range above 0.1 Hz. Since magnetic varia-\ntions were observed before the step-like increase of magnetic\nfield at equatorial station (main impulse, MI), the negative\ndeclinations resembled the so-called preliminary impulse, PI.\nIn this paper a mechanism for the generation of PI is intro-\nduced whereby PI\u2019s generation is linked to SCA \u2013 associ-\nated precipitation and the local enhancement of ionospheric\nconductivity leading to the reconstruction of the ionospheric\ncurrent system prior to MI. Calculation showed that PI po-\nlarity depends on orientation of the background electric field\nand location of the observation point relative to ionospheric\nirregularity. For one case of direct measurements of elec-\ntric field in the place where the ionospheric irregularity was\npresent, the sign of calculated disturbance corresponded to\nthe observed one. High-resolution measurements on IRIS\nfacility and meridional chain of the induction magnetome-\nters are utilized for the accurate timing of the impact of solar\nwind irregularity on the magnetopause.\nKeywords. Magnetospheric physics (Solar wind-\nmagnetosphere interactions)\nCorrespondence to: V. Safargaleev\n(vladimir.safargaleev@pgia.ru)\n1 Introduction\nThe geomagnetic sudden commencement (SC) is a very\nglobal phenomenon. Due to clear onset and well identified\nsource, which is the sudden increase in the solar wind dy-\nnamic pressure at interplanetary shocks and discontinuities,\nthe SC-associated events may serve as a diagnostic tool for\nthe magnetosphere and continue to attract scientific interest.\nThe sudden magnetospheric compression by solar wind\npressure pulse (SWPP) produces a variety of geophysical\nphenomena which may be easily detected with both ground\nbased and on-board instruments. It is well established that\nthe solar wind pressure pulse is associated with a step-like in-\ncrease of the geomagnetic H-component at low latitudes (e.g.\nAraki, 1994), pulsations of Pc 5 and Pc 1 frequency ranges\nat higher latitudes (e.g., Saito and Matsushita, 1967; Tep-\nley and Wentworth, 1962), the enhancement of ionospheric\nabsorption (e.g., Ranta and Ranta, 1990) and the intensifica-\ntion of electron and proton auroras (e.g., Brittnacher et al.,\n2000; Hubert et al., 2003). These effects and inter-relations\nbetween them are studied in the present paper.\nThe ground global magnetic response to SWPP may be\ncharacterized briefly as following (Araki, 1994). In the low\nlatitude region the waveform of the SC is approximately a\nstep-function. This variation is positive, indicating the in-\ncrease of geomagnetic field. Observations at higher latitudes\nshow the SC as two successive pulses: the preliminary im-\npulse (PI) and the main impulse (MI). The sign of PI may be\ndifferent at different stations. The appropriate current system\nof PI was suggested by Araki et al. (1982).\nResponding to SCs, magnetosphere can act as a cavity.\nMagnetic oscillations excited in the magnetospheric cavity\nare categorized in general as Pc 5 pulsations (150\u2013600 s\nperiod, 2\u20137 mHz frequency). To emphasize the connec-\ntion with SC, these pulsations are sometimes referred to as\nPsc 5. Besides the expected pulsations of compressional\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n248 V. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC\ntype, simultaneous Alfve\u00b4n oscillations are detected both at\nthe stationary orbit (Baumjohan et al., 1984) and at the\nEarth\u2019s surface (Tverskaya and Khorosheva, 1982). Multi-\nspacecraft measurements showed that a toroidal (Alfve\u00b4n)\nmode is observed over a narrow range of L-shells whereas\na poloidal (compressional or magnetoacoustic) wave has a\nmuch larger radial extent (Eriksson et al., 2006).\nIt is well known that that at the time of a sudden com-\nmencement a sudden burst of particle precipitations into D-\nregion occurs that gives rise to a short-lasting increase in ri-\nometer absorption, known as Sudden Commencement Ab-\nsorption (SCA). Ortner et al. (1962) reported that SCAs were\nlocated around the central line of the auroral zone. Increased\nelectron density at altitudes 80\u2013100 km has also been de-\ntected by the EISCAT radar during several SC events (Yahnin\net al., 1995; Manninen et al., 1996) indicating the wide en-\nergy range of precipitating electrons. The important point\nfor our study is the SCA-associated changes of ionospheric\nelectric field (Nielsen and Honary, 2000) and conductivity\n(Senior et al., 2007).\nThe auroral oval and polar cap ionosphere can be con-\nsidered as a screen on which the magnetospheric processes\nbecome visible. Owning to that, auroral images taken from\nspace may be applied for understanding of the global magne-\ntospheric response to SWPP. In particular, it has been found\nthat SC leads to enhancement of the electron auroras. Inside\nthe auroral oval, the intensification first occurs in the dayside\nand then expands toward the dawn and dusk (Zhou and Tsu-\nrutani, 1999; Kozlovsky et al., 2004). Liou et al. (2002) re-\nported sudden brightening of the electron auroral patch sepa-\nrated from the main (pre-existing) auroral oval. This kind of\nauroral response to SWPP was named as Midday Sub-auroral\nPatches (MSPs). The similar effects were found in proton\nauroras by Hubert et al. (2003) and Fuselier et al. (2004) and\nwere named \u201csubauroral proton flashes\u201d and \u201ctransient day-\nside subauroral proton precipitation\u201d.\nAmong the above listed SC-associated events, the prelim-\ninary impulse and excitation of the Alfve\u00b4n-like oscillations\nare the most intriguing ones. Although the PI is clearly seen\non the ground, it is not detected in interplanetary space. The\nexcitation of the Alfve\u00b4n waves implies the transformation of\nthe energy of the initial compression (magnetoacoustic) dis-\nturbance to the Alfve\u00b4n mode that is not possible theoretically\nin the uniform plasma.\nThe generation mechanisms for PI were suggested by\nNishida (1964), Tamao (1964) and Araki (1977). In general,\nthe mechanisms are based on the same idea \u2013 PI is caused by\nthe incidence of MHD disturbance to the polar ionosphere.\nThe disturbance is produced in the subsolar region of mag-\nnetopause at the very beginning of magnetosphere compres-\nsion. To explain the advance of the main impulse, one should\nhypothesize the disturbance to propagate faster than magne-\ntoacoustic wave responsible for the MI.\nTransformation of the magnetoacoustic wave into the\nAlfve\u00b4n mode is a more fundamental problem than generation\nof the PI and has been discussed therefore in many papers.\nThe basic idea is that the magnetosphere is a non-uniform\nmedium which leads to the coupling of these two modes (e.g.\nHasegawa and Chen, 1974). However, why during SC the\ncoupling occurs in the narrow range of L-shells is not well\nunderstood.\nNote that in the studies mentioned the source is regarded\nto be the same for the PI and Alfve\u00b4n oscillations, as well as\nfor the main impulse. That is a front of compressional dis-\nturbance propagating Earthward at the velocity of magnetoa-\ncoustic wave. Safargaleev and Maltsev (1987) suggested that\nthe source of PI and Alfve\u00b4n oscillations may be the same but\ndifferent from that for the MI. They supposed that it could be\nthe localized area of enhanced ionospheric conductivity. In\nthe presence of ionospheric electric field, the appearance of\nionospheric irregularity \u201claunches\u201d Alfve\u00b4n wave through the\nwell-known polarization effect. Velocity of precipitating par-\nticles producing the ionospheric irregularity is much higher\nthan that for magnetoacoustic wave. Therefore Alfve\u00b4n oscil-\nlations will start on the ground slightly prior to the arrival of\nthe front of compressional disturbance (main impulse). Su-\nperposition of oscillations and MI creates the effect of high\nlatitude preliminary impulse. Safargaleev and Maltsev also\nshowed that the disturbance of the current system caused\nby the local enhancement of the ionospheric conductivity re-\nsembles the equivalent current system of the preliminary im-\npulse obtained by Araki et al. (1982).\nIn this study we perform a comparative analysis of mag-\nnetic and riometric absorption disturbances caused by SC\nwith the aim to test the hypothesis by Safargaleev and Malt-\nsev (1987) on the ionospheric origin of preliminary im-\npulse and SC-associated Alfve\u00b4n oscillations at high lati-\ntudes. We use the data of Scandinavian magnetometers\nnetwork IMAGE to identify the sudden commencements\nwith preliminary impulse. As indirect evidence for the SC-\ninitiated enhancement of ionospheric conductivity we regard\nthe above mentioned SCA events inferred from the data of\nthe Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS imaging riometer. We only consider\nthe local near-noon events since the interaction between so-\nlar wind and Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is more direct in the\nnoon sector. We do not discuss the later stage of develop-\nment of the events (after the front of disturbance arrives to\nthe Earth). Otherwise we should take into account the IMF\neffects and complex character of propagation in the magne-\ntosphere of different MHD-modes launched by SWPP. In the\nlight of our findings, we make recommendations on the use\nof SC-excited Pc 1 pulsations in the tasks of magnetospheric\nphysics.\n2 Instrumentation and interval selection\nNorthern Scandinavia is located under the auroral oval and\nis a region where the SC-initiated precipitation and accom-\npanying events may be detected by a number of instruments.\nAnn.

Location of the instruments in the region of observations.\nBlue area is field of view of the imaging riometer IRIS facility.\nOf particular interest to our study are riometers and magne-\ntometers.\nFigure 1 shows the location of measurement points in this\nstudy. The Kilpisja\u00a8rvi IRIS imaging riometer (69.05\u25e6 N,\n20.79\u25e6 E, MLT=UT+\u223c2 h) provides cosmic radio noise ab-\nsorption at 38 MHz. The system produces an array of 49\nnarrow beams with widths between 13\u25e6 and 16\u25e6. The IM-\nAGE chain of magnetometers covers roughly magnetic lati-\ntudes 55\u25e6\u201375\u25e6. The meridional middle chain of IMAGE is\nparticularly suitable for electrojet studies. In longitudinal di-\nrection the coverage is best in the standard auroral oval re-\ngion (64\u25e6\u201367\u25e6 magnetic latitudes). Currently the network in-\ncludes 29 magnetometers with sampling rate of 10 s. Finnish\npulsation magnetometer chain contains six three-component\nsearch coil magnetometer stations located on Scandinavian\nPeninsula. In addition, the station of the Polar Geophysical\nInstitute, Russia, at Barentsburg (BAB) was used. Stations\nare timed by GPS system and sampling rate of the data of\ninduction magnetometer is 40 Hz.\nStatistically, the most direct response of the ionosphere to\nthe impact of solar wind irregularity to the magnetopause is\nassumed to be observed around the noon-sector. Close to\nthe dawn and dusk, the propagation of the disturbances both\nin the magnetosphere and ionosphere should be taken into\naccount. To exclude the propagating effects, we concentrate\nmainly on the events within\u223c6 h interval centered near local\nnoon at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (MLT=UT+\u223c2 h 40 m).\nTypical amplitude of fluctuations in solar wind dynamic\npressure is 0.5\u20131 nPa. We limited ourselves by considering\nthe SCs with magnitude notably exceeded this value (except\none event that occurred under the quite conditions in solar\nwind and produced well manifested response on the ground).\nNote, that well recognized response to SC in riometric and\nmagnetic data was one of the limitations on the event selec-\ntion.\nTo define the moment of main impulse we used the\ndata from magnetic equatorial stations Bangui (BNG,\n4.33\u25e6 N, 18.57\u25e6 E, MLT=UT+\u223c2 h) and Addis Abbaba\n(AAE, 9.02\u25e6 N, 38.77\u25e6 E, MLT=UT+\u223c2 h). Using these data\nfor comparison with others, a higher time resolution samples\nof 30 s before and after the minute (IAGA format) was cho-\nsen. Only events with clear onset were accepted. The events\nwith weak negative excursion prior to 1 min step-like in-\ncrease (low latitude preliminary impulse) were also excluded\nfrom the consideration.\nWe have examined the Wind data on solar wind ion pres-\nsure through the period from June 2000 to April 2004. Al-\nthough more than 200 SCs were analyzed altogether, only 11\nevents meeting the above formulated criteria were found and\nundergone the further analysis. In the next section a typical\nevent observed on 18 March 2002 is described in details, and\nanalysis of all the events is summarized in Sect. 4.\n3 Geomagnetic disturbances associated with particle\nprecipitation initiated by sudden increase in solar\nwind dynamic pressure: a case study\n3.1 Sudden magnetosphere compression on 18 March\n2002: general description of the event\nFigure 2 is an overview of the disturbances occurred on the\nground in response to strong increase in solar wind dynamic\npressure. At about 13:10 UT the Wind satellite, probing\nthe interplanetary medium atXGSM=44RE, YGSM=\u2212117RE,\nand ZGSM=\u221234RE, observed the increase of solar wind\npressure up to\u223c23 nPa within five minute interval (top panel\nin Fig. 2a). We should note that this significantly exceeded\nthe typical amplitude of variations of solar wind pressure.\n12 min later, main impulse was detected at low latitudes\n(AAE). The time lag corresponds approximately to the prop-\nagation time of the front of irregularity from satellite position\nto the magnetopause. Rather complex magnetic variations\nwere seen at IMAGE magnetometer network (middle panel\nin Fig. 2a).

At first, the ampli-\ntude of variations in frequency range of 0\u20130.4 Hz increased\nsuddenly in auroral zone (ROV) and at high-latitudes (BAB).\nSome minutes later, the enhancement of rising frequency oc-\ncurred at ROV. Finally, the series of two ULF-bursts with\ncentral frequency \u223c1.2 Hz and repetition period of about\n12 min was detected in auroral zone.\nFigure 3 shows the behavior of electron auroras initiated\nby sudden magnetosphere compression. The auroras en-\nhanced near local noon and then split up in two bright pat-\nterns propagating to dawn and dusk inside the boundary\nplasma sheet (bps) as was indicated by data of the DMSP\nF13 satellite passing above the area of observations near\n13:26 UT. The conjugation of the postnoon auroral oval with\nbps was reported earlier by Kozlovsky et al. (2002). While\nthe riometric enhancement might be caused by the intensifi-\ncation of particle precipitation to ionospheric D-region, the\nenhancement of electron auroras indicate the increase of par-\nticle precipitation to E-region.\nSo, by taking into account the enhancement of proton au-\nroras, which will be discussed later, the chosen event presents\nalmost full set of SWPP accompanying phenomena listed in\nthe Introduction section. In the following sections we discuss\nin the detail the possible connection of PI with electron pre-\ncipitation and Pc 1 pulsations with precipitation of protons.\n3.2 Preliminary impulse and sudden commencements\nin riometric absorption and dayside electron auro-\nras\nThe SWPP associated phenomena are presented in Fig. 4 in\nmore details. Magnetic data from low latitude station AAE\nhas the lowest temporal resolution of 1 min whereas other\ndata were obtained at 10 s resolution. Nevertheless, it is seen\nthat disturbance at KIL started before the step increase of ge-\nomagnetic field at low latitudes (main impulse) and resem-\nbled a typical preliminary impulse. The AAE data are av-\neraging higher time resolution samples from before and af-\nter the minute. In such a case, the MI at AAE corresponds\nto step increase of magnetic field at KIL, which also started\nnear 13:23:30 UT.\nThe weak negative deviation at KIL (preliminary impulse)\nstarted almost simultaneously with enhancement in riomet-\nric absorption. In Introduction section this phenomenon was\nreferred to as SCA. The enhancement occurred within the\nwhole IRIS field of view, as seen in Fig. 4b, and indicated\nthe increase of the precipitation of the electrons with energy\nof several tens of keV. The SWPP initiated also more soft\nprecipitation, which caused electron auroras (see Fig. 3). Al-\nthough the temporal resolution of SIE instrument onboard\nthe IMAGE satellite is one frame per two minutes, in the\npresent case it was possible to find out that auroras appeared\nat 13:22:40 UT, i.e. before the main impulse had started on\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010\n252 V. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC\nFig. 5. Disturbances in the frequency band above 0.1 Hz (upper and\nlower panels) and SC-initiated magnetic variations at LIR and KIL\nand sudden commencement absorption (central panel).\nthe ground. Based on this observation, we use the riome-\nter data to indicate precipitation in the wide energy range for\nthe other SWPP events when IMAGE satellite data were not\navailable.\nGood temporal correlation PI with SCA indicates the con-\nnection between them. We think that precipitation could lead\nto reconfiguration of the ionospheric current system via the\nlocal increase of ionospheric conductivity. No doubts, elec-\ntron auroras are accompanied with change of ionospheric\nconductivity. Recently Senior et al. (2007) showed that there\nis a relation between riometric absorption and the conduc-\ntance, too. Since the particle velocity is higher than the ve-\nlocity of magnetoacoustic MHD wave responsible for MI,\nthe changes of ionospheric currents starts earlier than the\nwave arrives at Earth. Thus, the precipitation produces on\nthe ground an imaginary effect equivalent to the preliminary\nimpulse. Note also, that local area of enhanced conductiv-\nity may be a source of Alfve\u00b4n wave (e.g. Kozlovsky et al.,\n1997), the signatures of which are seen in Fig. 4 as pulsa-\ntions of 100 s period at KIL.\nAt the initial stage of the event the amplitudes of both\nPI and SCA are small. At this time the enhanced auroras\nare observed in post-noon sector (see Fig. 3), away from\nKilpisjarvi. The magnetic disturbance reached maximum at\n13:27 UT, when the area of enhanced luminosity has shifted\nclose to the region of observations. The intensities of both\nauroras and SCA are also higher at this moment. This also\nsupports our assumption on the possible source of prelimi-\nnary impulse.\n3.3 Bursts of ULF noise and dayside proton auroras\nThe sonograms in Fig. 5 show in the detail the initial stage\nof SWPP-induced ULF activity at high latitudes (BAB) and\nin auroral zone (ROV). First of all, we draw reader\u2019s atten-\ntion to the burst of increasing frequency (further referred as\n\u201crising bursts\u201d) started at 13:24:20 UT at ROV (moment T\nin Fig. 5). Such kind of ULF activity, firstly described by\nTepley and Wentworth (1962), seems to be the most typical\ngeomagnetic response to the SWPP in the frequency range\n0.1\u20133 Hz (e.g. Kangas et al., 1998). This feature is associ-\nated with the development of electromagnetic ion-cyclotron\n(EMIC) instability in the equatorial plane of magnetosphere\nnear the noon. In the present case, the source of the rising\nburst in the magnetosphere is also limited in radial direc-\ntion and seems to be conjugated with auroral zone, because\nno response is seen \u223c800 km north and south of Kevo (see\nFig. 2b). In Fig. 6, where three intervals of activity of proton\nauroras are presented, the rising burst may be associated with\nthe appearance of \u201csubauroral proton flash\u201d in postnoon sec-\ntor between 13:22:40 UT and 13:24:43 UT (series of images\nin Fig. 6a). This is expected since EMIC instability should\nlead both to generation of the waves of Pc 1 type and proton\nprecipitations.\nAnother form of ULF-response, which has also been pre-\nviously mentioned in the literature (Safargaleev et al., 2002),\nis a series of two bursts at central frequency \u223c1.2 Hz seen in\nthe middle spectrogram in Fig. 2b after 13:30 UT and around\n13:45 UT. As it is seen in Fig. 6b and c these pulsations are\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/\nV. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC 253\nFig. 6. Images showing three intensifications of proton auroras in the midday sector. Each of intensifications may be associated with\nenhancement of ULF activity at KIL (see Fig. 2b, central panel).\naccompanied with proton aurora enhancements, too. Unlike\nthe rising burst, these auroral flashes are observed at higher\nlatitudes, presumably in the cusp vicinity. Note that other\nkind of proton auroras, expanding inside auroral oval toward\nthe dawn and dusk, did not demonstrate apparent correlation\nwith ULF-activity.\nSudden enhancement of ULF noise in the frequency range\nbelow 0.4 Hz, which occurred almost simultaneously with\nSCA, at the moment T0=13:21:30 UT (see Fig. 5), was not\nreported before as an attribute of SC-initiated ULF activity.\nThe enhancement is seen at BAB, ROV and NUR but is more\nimpressive at BAB, i.e. close to the latitudes where electron\nauroras appear in response to SWPP (Fig. 3) and magnetic\ndisturbance was large (Fig. 2a). It is suggested that similar to\npreliminary impulse, this kind of ULF activity is also caused\nby the disturbances of ionospheric currents in the region of\nelectron precipitation. Sudden ULF-enhancement gets ahead\nof rising burst by three minutes. The possible reasons for this\nwill be discussed later in Sect. 4.4.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 High latitude magnetic disturbances and sudden\ncommencement in riometric absorption: statistics\nCharacteristics of the events considered in this study are pre-\nsented in Table 1. In the second column we indicate the date\nof SC. Amplitudes of SWPP in space (mainly, at the Wind\nsatellite) and at low latitudes (mainly, at BNG observatory)\nare in third and sixth columns. The start times of magnetic\ndisturbance in horizontal X-component at KIL (1X) and SC-\nassociated riometric disturbance (SCA) are in the seventh\nand tenth columns. Although all magnetic disturbances at\nhigh latitudes were observed before the disturbance at low\nlatitude station, not all of them developed a negative prelimi-\nnary impulse prior the step-like increase as shown in Fig. 4a.\nHence, a general term \u201cpreliminary magnetic disturbance\u201d,\nPMD, instead of \u201cpreliminary impulse\u201d is used in the follow-\ning discussion which will be discussed later. Columns eight\nand eleven contain information about amplitude of the pre-\nliminary magnetic disturbance and SCA. In the ninth column,\nthe period of two modes of SC-initiated pulsations, Psc 5, is\ngiven. The sign \u201c\u2013\u201d means that no pulsations were possible\nto identify in the data of IMAGE network.\nWe separate data set in two parts. For the events 1\u20136 in Ta-\nble 1 the preliminary magnetic disturbance and SCA start si-\nmultaneously (within 10 s ambiguity due to data resolution).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/ Ann.

The mea-\nsurements during events 7\u201311 took place in the afternoon.\nFor these events SCA is delayed relative to the start of pre-\nliminary magnetic disturbance by 20\u2013180 s. The delay may\nbe explained in the frame of generation mechanism of PI\nsuggested by Safargaleev and Maltsev (1987) and briefly dis-\ncussed in previous section. Indeed, the SCA is seen when the\nprecipitation occurs in the vicinity of riometer set whereas\nthe magnetometers are sensitive to the disturbance of iono-\nspheric current far away from the measurement point and,\nhence, can detect it prior to particle precipitation observed at\nIRIS.\nFor all events considered, the amplitude of preliminary\nmagnetic disturbance decreased from KIL to lower latitudes\n(see, for example, Fig. 2a). This is consistent with our as-\nsumption regarding the localization of the ionospheric source\nof PMD at high latitudes. However, no systematic behavior\nwas found form KIL to Spitsbergen Archipelago, probably,\ndue to poor coverage by the ground measurements of this\nvery interesting area, which is conjugated with various day-\nside magnetospheric domains (mantle, cusp, llbl, bps).\nThe variety of high latitude magnetic response to SWPP is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 7. Some statistical results are presented\nin Fig. 8.\nSix disturbances of eleven were negative and looked like\na typical preliminary impulse whereas others were positive.\nSometimes the disturbances of the opposite polarities were\nobserved at the same place (KIL) and, approximately, at the\nsame time (for instance, events 8 and 9 in the Table 1), which\nmay not be explained by spatial distribution of the equiva-\nlent ionospheric current system of PI suggested by Araki et\nal. (1982). Figure 8a shows the dependence of the polarity\nof PMD on the sign of IMF Bz component averaged over the\n30 min interval preceding the sudden enhancement of plasma\ndensity and bulk speed at ACE satellite. Most of the prelim-\ninary disturbances, which look like the typical preliminary\nimpulse, started when Bz was northward whereas prior pos-\nitive PMD the IMF Bz was directed southward. The sign\nof Bz influences the configuration of the dayside magneto-\nsphere, shifting, in particularity, the ionospheric projection\nof subsolar point poleward or equatorward via the reconnec-\ntion process. Hence, the region of precipitation may also be\nshifted poleward or equatorward depending on the IMF Bz\nsign.\nIn general, the shape of PMD may be described as super-\nposition of damping oscillations and delayed by 1\u20132 min the\nstep-like increase of the magnetic field (Fig. 8b). Note that\nthe shape of preliminary magnetic disturbance in Fig. 7 does\nnot repeat the shape of the bay in riometric absorption. This\nfinding means that beside the increase of the ionospheric con-\nductivity, there should be another factor, which regulates the\ndevelopment of PMD in time. We think that this may be\nmovement\/expansion of the irregularity relative to the obser-\nvation point.\nData presented in Fig. 8c show no correlation between\nthe amplitudes of the roimetric disturbance and SWPP. For\nexample, the strongest SCA was detected during event 1\nwhen IRIS was near the noon. Rather larger pressure pulses\n(events 8 and 11) were accompanied with absorption en-\nhancements, which are even weaker by factor of 2. The\nmeasurements during these events were in the afternoon sec-\ntor. It is therefore suggested that for the most of events\nthe maximum precipitation occurred not just above the IRIS\nfield of view but at some distance from it and then propa-\ngated\/expanded toward the observation region (see Sect. 3.2\nand Fig. 3) following the front of MHD disturbance in the\nmagnetosphere.\nAnn.

Different shape of magnetic response to SWPP at high latitudes. Magnetic variation begins simultaneously with SCA event but\nforestalls the step-like disturbance at equatorial station.\nIn the next section we summarize the results of observa-\ntions with emphasis on the main features of the preliminary\nmagnetic disturbance. A simple semi-empirical model of dis-\nturbance will be discussed.\n4.2 Polarization electric fields generated by an elliptic\nionospherc irregularity as a source of preliminary\nmagnetic disturbance\nIn this section we present a model of high latitude magnetic\nresponse to SWPP, which fits the following experimental re-\nsults inferred from the data analysis.\n1. Geomagnetic variation at high latitudes precedes the\nstep-like increase of geomagnetic H-component at\nequatorial station.\n2. Geomagnetic variation at high latitudes starts almost si-\nmultaneously with enhancement of the particle precip-\nitation near the meridian plane where the solar wind\ndiscontinuity hits the magnetopause (near local noon).\nOtherwise, the increase of precipitation is delayed after\nthe magnetic disturbance by 1\u20132 min.\n3. The magnetic disturbance looks like a superposition of\noscillations and a step-like increase of the field, which\nis shifted by 1\u20132 min relative to the oscillation onset.\nHerewith, the former are not accompanied with the vari-\nations in riometric absorption.\n4. The oscillations start as positive or negative deviation\ndepending on the orientation of IMF Bz component.\nPositive response is observed when Bz is negative be-\nfore the event and vice versa.\nFor the most of recent models of PI, the general assumption\nis that the ionospheric currents responsible for PI are induced\nby the electric fields transported from the outer magneto-\nsphere (Araki et al., 1994, and references therein). Fujita\n(2003) presented a quantitative model of the PI, where the\nPI current is first excited as an enhanced Chapman-Ferraro\ncurrent in the magnetopause and then turns to the magne-\ntosphere along the wavefront of the compressional signal\nlaunched by the impulse. To explain the main feature of\nPI, namely, its occurrence before the main impulse, such\nhypotheses as a difference of propagation velocity of SC-\ninitiated waves along and across the magnetic field line, or\ncomplex shape of the dayside magnetosphere, or specific\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010\n256 V. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC\nshape of the front of disturbance, should be assumed. Nev-\nertheless, the generation mechanism for PI is still a point of\ndebate (e.g. Kikuchi and Araki, 2002).\nSafargaleev and Maltsev (1987) suggested that the iono-\nspheric currents responsible for PI are induced by the elec-\ntric fields, which appear in the ionosphere directly as the\npolarization fields inside and outside the localized area of\nenhanced conductivity. The ionospheric irregularity is pro-\nduced by precipitating particles. In this model, the time\nshift between PI and step variation appears because the par-\nticles move in the magnetosphere faster then MHD waves\nand, hence, reach the ionosphere prior to the disturbance re-\nsponsible for main impulse. The situation is similar to that\nobserved in our study in riometric absorption (see examples\nin Figs. 4 and 7).\nThe theoretical details of generation and calculation of po-\nlarization electric field in the ionosphere may be found, for\ninstance, in the papers devoted to excitation of Pi2 pulsations\nby brightening of auroral arc (Maltsev at al., 1974), genera-\ntion of the Alfve\u00b4n impulse in the ionosphere (Kozlovsky et\nal., 1997) and behavior of the electric field in the vicinity of\nvarying auroras (Safargaleev et al., 2000). It was shown that\nthe problem may be easily solved if one presents the iono-\nsphere as a complex plane with real axis x directed to the\nEast and imaginary axis y directed to the North. Within such\napproach, electric field vectors are presented as complex\nnumbers likeE=Ex+iEy, the independent complex variable\n(distance to the observation point) is defined as z= x+iy, and\ncomplex conductivity has a form 6 =6P\u2212 i6H, where 6P\nand 6H are the height-integrated Pedersen and Hall conduc-\ntances. For the elliptical irregularity stretched along x(i.e.\nalong the latitude) and located in the origin of coordinates,\nthe disturbed electric fields, which arise due to polarization\nof the irregularity in the ambient electric field, E0, may be\ncalculated as (see Safargaleev at al., 2000, and references\ntherein):\nE1= a+b\na\u2212b\n60+6\u22170 +26w\n61\u221260\n\u00b5E0+E\u22170\n\u00b5\u00b5\u2217\u22121 \u2212E0 (1)\nwhere \u00b5= a+b\na\u2212b\n6\u22171+60+26w\n6\u22171\u22126\u22170 ;\nE2=\u221212\n(\nE1+ a+b\na\u2212bE\n\u2217\n1\n)\uf8eb\uf8ed 1\u221a\n1\u2212 a2\u2212b2\nz2\n\u22121\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\u2217 (2)\nEquation (1) gives the value of the disturbed electric field,\nE1, inside the ellipse, and Eq. (2) describes the disturbance\nof electric field outside the inhomogeneity. Here 6w is ef-\nfective conductivity of the magnetospheric plasma for prop-\nagating Alfve\u00b4n wave, 6w=(\u00b50VA)\u22121, where \u00b50 is the vac-\nuum magnetic permeability, VA is the Alfve\u00b4n velocity, a and\nb are the major and minor semi-axes of the ellipse. Symbol\n\u201c*\u201d means the complex conjugate, the index 0 corresponds\nto the background values. Equations (1\u20132) are obtained by\nassuming that charges and field aligned currents are located\non the ellipse periphery, and the undisturbed electric fieldE0\nis uniform.\nA local change of conductivity leads to the reconfigura-\ntion of the system of ionospheric currents and produces at the\nsurface of the Earth a magnetic disturbance, which at some\ndistance from the irregularity may be estimated as:\n1B =\u223c i1Jeq\u223c i(60+6w)E2 (3)\nwhere imaginary unit i provides the phase difference of 90\u25e6\nbetween the equivalent ionospheric current, Jeq, and mag-\nnetic field.\nSenior et al. (2007) showed that the Hall conductance\nand the conductance ratio, 6H\/6P, have the strongest as-\nsociations with cosmic noise absorption and the Pedersen\nconductance is weakly related to the absorption. The sim-\nilar behavior is demonstrated by ionospheric conductance\nin association with precipitation causing optical auroras in\nthe nightside ionosphere (e.g. Safargaleev et al., 2000).\nSo, for estimation of the field disturbances E1 and E2\nwe will assume background conductivity 6H0=20 Ohm\u22121,\n6H0\/6P0=2, 6w=2 and disturbed values (i.e. inside the ir-\nregularity) 6H1=26H0, 6H1\/6P1=4.\nThe results of calculation of the disturbed electric field,\nE2, and associated disturbance in the northward component\nof geomagnetic field on the ground, 1H , are presented in\nFig. 9 for four cases of orientation of ambient electric field.\nUpper panel in each figure is a sketch showing the orientation\nof the irregularity (gray area) with respect to E0 (open ar-\nrow). Horizontal bold line at the distance 1.5b south of irreg-\nularity indicates the profile along which the disturbances of\nelectric field (arrows) and magnetic field were calculated us-\ning Eqs. (1\u20133). Colored areas correspond to positive (green)\nand negative (yellow) values of 1H. Here we focus mainly\non the sign of 1H, whereas calculated amplitudes of distur-\nbances may not be reliable since we have no realistic data\non E0, ionospheric conductivity, and changes caused by the\nprecipitation.\nModel situations (a) and (b) correspond to location of the\nirregularity in the late afternoon sector poleward or equa-\ntorward of the convection reversal boundary where the N-\nS component of the ionospheric electric field dominates.\nModel situations (c) and (d) may be associated with location\nof the irregularity in the vicinity of the cusp where the hori-\nzontal component of the ambient electric field prevails (east-\nward or westward dependening on IMF Bz orientation). Al-\nthough the configuration of the electric field at high latitudes\nis rather complex, even this simplified model allows us to\nunderstand two observed features of PMD. Firstly, the mag-\nnetic disturbance caused by the irregularity in the same point\nmay be of different polarity dependening on E0 orientation,\nwhich, in turn, is notably defined by IMF Bz. We pointed out\nthis finding in previous section. Secondly, the impulse char-\nacter of variation might be conditioned by azimuthal prop-\nagation of the irregularity and adjusted stationary (in time)\ncurrent system above the magnetometer. Indeed, one may\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/\nV. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC 257\nFig. 8.

As\nmentioned above, the impulse-like change of PMD may not\nbe connected with temporal variation of ionospheric conduc-\ntivity inside the irregularity since no corresponding changes\nwas found in riometric data.\nNote that model simulations may explain the non-perfect\ncorrelation between the sign of PMD and Bz orientation (see\nFig. 8a). Although the position of the observation point is\nfixed in space, the location of the ionospheric irregularity\nmay change with respect to the orientation of the front of\nsolar wind discontinuity that yields PMDs of different polar-\nities even under the same IMF Bz conditions.\nIn one case it was possible to test the model using some\nresults of in situ measurements as input parameters. In\nFig. 10a, two frames from the IMAGE satellite show that au-\nroras responded to SWPP in pre-noon sector between 67\u201370\u25e6\nMLAT. The DMSP F15 passed above this area 15 min before\nthe onset in riometric absorption and positive magnetic im-\npulse (see Table 1 and Fig. 7). The satellite detected the pre-\ncipitation typical for central plasma sheet and also measured\nthe electric field which we regard as ambient electric field.\nThe variations of two electric components along fragment\nof trajectory shown with white line on the top image are pre-\nsented in Fig. 10b. Red arrow indicates the magnetic latitude\nof KIL. The electric field demonstrated the bi-polar variation\nin the south-north component at approximately 69\u25e6 MLAT,\nwhich may be a signature of the sheet of upward field aligned\ncurrent on the poleward boundary of auroral oval (Kozlovsky\net al., 2006). The averaging of the electric field over the in-\nterval between FAC and MLAT of KIL (i.e. over the auroral\noval) gives Ex0=20 mV\/m and Ey0=10 mV\/m. Here, x-axis\nis directed to the East, and direction of y is to the North.\nSituation considered is close to that, which is presented in\nFig. 9c: eastward component of E0 is twice the northward\ncomponent and Bz is negative.\nSketch on the upper panel in Fig. 10c shows the colloca-\ntion of irregularity (gray area) and observation point (red cir-\ncle), open arrow is ambient electric field. The spatial distri-\nbution along the latitude of KIL (red line on the sketch) was\nobtained after substitution of above estimated E0 to Eqs. (1\u2013\n3) and presented below the sketch. During the event, the\nmagnetometer KIL was located very close to the eastern edge\nof the irregularity where our calculations give positive PMD,\nwhich is in accordance with observations. The impulse- like\nshape of PMD may be the effect of azimuthal (eastward) ex-\npansion of the irregularity.\n4.3 Psc 5 and sudden commencement absorption ex-\ncited by SC\nMagnetic pulsations of Pc 5 frequency range are another\ninteresting phenomenon following SWPP. These pulsations\ndemonstrate signatures of the Alfve\u00b4n waves both on the\nground (Tverskaya and Khorosheva, 1982) and in space\n(Baumjohan et al., 1984; Eriksson et al., 2006) although the\ndisturbance, which initiates Psc 5, is the compressional one.\nThe problem of transformation of the energy from the mag-\nnetoacoustic oacoustic oscillations to the Alfve\u00b4n mode is a\nfundamental problem of space physics rather than a particu-\nlar case of generation of Pc 5 pulsations after SC. Among the\nnumerous theories suggested (see, for instance, references in\nthe paper by Eriksson et al., 2006) we note the generation\nof the Alfve\u00b4n wave by the area of enhanced ionospheric con-\nductivity (e.g. Kozlovsky et al., 1997, and references therein)\nsince this mechanism is in good agreement with our previous\nsuggestion (Safargaleev and Maltsev, 1987) and the observa-\ntions discussed in the this paper.\nIn the presence of ambient electric field, the appearance of\narea of enhanced conductivity leads to the charge accumu-\nlation at its edges. Due to high plasma conductance in the\ndirection of magnetic field, this polarization charge should\nescape from the ionosphere along the magnetic field lines,\nwhich give rise to the outgoing Alfve\u00b4n wave. Also, such\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010\n258 V. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC\nFig. 9.

Sometimes no pulsations were\ndetected or the amplitude of pulsations was very small, and\nthere were occasions when the oscillation occurred it two\nmodes simultaneously. The period of the modes is very close\nto that, which was inferred from the recent measurements on-\nboard the Cluster satellites (Eriksson et al., 2006). Note that\noscillations with period 120\u2013140 s fit our hypothesis on the\nionospheric origin of Psc 5 pulsations better than 60-s oscil-\nlations, since the time of a few minutes seems to be closer to\nthe time of Alfve\u00b4n wave propagation between high latitude\nionospheres (see for instance, Safargaleev et al., 2003).\nThe electric field of the outgoing Alfve\u00b4n wave is a com-\nbination of the polarization electric fields E1 and E2 deter-\nmined by Eqs. (1\u20132). In accordance with Eq. (2), the field\noutside the irregularity decreases as 1\/z2, where z is complex\nanalogue of the distance from the irregularity. So, the Alfve\u00b4n\noscillations will be observed in the area, which is restricted at\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/\nV.

This yields the negative or positive impulse of\n\u223c1 min duration (indicated as1t in Fig. 11).

The\nthird one is the Alfve\u00b4n oscillations triggered by the appear-\nance of local ionospheric irregularity. Period of pulsations is\na few minutes (denoted as T in Fig. 11).\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/ Ann. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010\n260 V.

Red line indicates the time of\nSCA.\n4.4 SC-initiated magnetic activity in the frequency\nrange 0.1\u20133 Hz\nIn accordance with Tepley and Wentworth (1962) and Sa-\nfargaleev et al. (2002), approximately 20% of SWPPs are\naccompanied with excitation of a narrowband burst (or se-\nries of bursts) of rising frequency like that shown in Fig. 2b\nand Fig. 5 (bottom panel). One more known response to the\nSWPP in this frequency range is an increase of amplitude\nand carrier frequency of pre-existing Pc 1 pulsations of the\n\u201cpearls\u201d type (e.g. Kangas et al., 1998). In this paper, we\nemphasize the broadband enhancement of the ULF activity\nthat occurred simultaneously with positive bay in riometric\nabsorption and preliminary magnetic disturbance as a new\nform of geomagnetic response to SWPP.\nFigure 12 shows the SC-initiated broadband magnetic en-\nhancement at the meridional array of induction magnetome-\nters. At first, the enhancement was observed at IVA. The mo-\nment is indicated with red vertical line. A few seconds later it\nwas detected at BAB and NUR located \u223c1100 km north and\n\u223c900 km south of IVA, respectively. Satellite DMSP F14\nflew above BAB at 09:59 UT (i.e. three minutes after ULF\nbroadband enhancement) and observed precipitation that are\ntypical for the boundary plasma sheet (DMSP data are not\npresented here). This means that BAB, as well as IVA and\nNUR, was on closed magnetic field lines. Hence, the lag\nof signal both poleward and equatorward IVA might be con-\nditioned rather by the expansion of ULF-disturbance in the\nionospheric waveguide away from IVA than propagation of\nits source in the magnetosphere in radial direction. The fig-\nure also shows that the magnetic enhancement at IVA co-\nincides in time with enhancement in riometric absorption at\nKIL, which is the earliest response to sudden magnetosphere\ncompression.\nThe above listed features of the broadband ULF enhance-\nment give an opportunity to use the meridional chain of in-\nduction magnetometers for accurate timing of the impact of\nsolar wind irregularity to the magnetopause even if the ab-\nsorption data are absent for some reasons. As an exam-\nple, we consider one more event (28 October 2000), which\nwas not presented in the Table 1 because of the noise in\nIRIS data. Sudden compression was accompanied by in-\ntensification of pre-existing Pc 1 \u201cpearls\u201d, broadband ULF-\nenhancement and the burst of rising frequency (Fig. 13a),\nas well as proton auroras (Fig. 13b). The auroral response\nwas mentioned earlier in the paper by Fuselier et al. (2004)\namong other \u201ctransient dayside subauroral proton precipita-\ntion\u201d events produced by rapid changes in solar wind dy-\nnamic pressure. Broadband enhancement at 09:54 UT is faint\n(see for comparison Fig. 12) but this allows us to identify\nthe burst of rising frequency and define the time of its onset\nwith higher accuracy than, for instance, for the event pre-\nsented in Fig. 5. Enhancement begins almost simultaneously\nwith a negative preliminary impulse at KIL and intensifica-\ntion of Pc 1 \u201cpearls\u201d at OUL. The burst is delayed by 100 s\n(see Fig. 13c). Although the proton auroras appeared in IM-\nAGE data at the same time as the burst (see Fig. 13b), we can\nnot claim that they started simultaneously because of the low\ntemporal resolution of IMAGE data.\nNo burst-like disturbances were seen both poleward and\nequatorward of KIL (see Figs. 2 and 13c), which is consis-\ntent with the assumption that the generation region of the\nAnn.

Pulsations of Pc 1 band are commonly\naccepted as the Alfve\u00b4n waves generated via the development\nof electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) instability. Proton\nauroras are also associated with this instability since they\nare produced by the particles scattered by the EMIC-waves.\nHence, we can suppose that the SC-stimulated protons au-\nroras in Figs. 6 and 13b are ionospheric \u201cprojection\u201d of the\ngeneration region for rising bursts shown in Figs. 5 (bottom\npanel) and 13c (upper panel).\nThe observed delay of the bursts relative to the absorption\nenhancement may be conditioned by two factors. First, the\ncondition for development of EMIC instability, which is re-\nsponsible for rising burst generation, may differ from that for\nelectromagnetic electron-cyclotron (EEC) instability causing\nelectron precipitation and increase of riometric absorption,\nalthough both instabilities have the plasma anisotropy as a\nmutual source of the free energy. Indeed, the growth rate for\nEEC and EIC instabilities depends on many factors, which\nmakes difficult their comparative analysis.\nSecond factor is a difference in propagation time of the\nelectrons and EIC-waves from the generation region (equa-\ntorial plane of the magnetosphere) to the ionosphere. This\nissue was discussed earlier by Safargaleev et al. (2003) and\nis illustrated on the sketch in Fig. 14a. Magnetosphere com-\npression leads to the development of plasma anisotropy in the\nequatorial plane (dark area), which, in turn, gives rise to both\nEEC and EIC instabilities (top panel). The EEC-waves scat-\nter the electrons to the ionosphere (thin black arrow), due to\nwhich the absorption and ionospheric conductivity enhance\nand Alfve\u00b4n impulse is launched to the magnetosphere (red\narrow on the middle panel).

As-\nsuming that the Alfve\u00b4n impulse and EIC-wave propagate at\nthe same velocity, we indicate on this panel also the Alfve\u00b4n\nimpulse launched from the conjugate ionosphere. We do not\ndiscuss here the proton precipitation since we can not per-\nform correct timing of proton aurora enhancement for the\nevents considered.\nSafargaleev et al. (2003) suggested the method for estima-\ntion of the period for resonant (Alfve\u00b4n) oscillations assum-\ning the time lag of the rising burst to be close to the time\nof the Alfve\u00b4n wave half-hop between conjugate ionospheres.\nOur observations support this suggestion. Indeed, during the\nevent on 28 October 2000, the proton auroras occurred at lat-\nitudes of SOR (see Fig. 13b), and the time lag of about 2 min\ninferred from the sonogram in Fig. 13c is close to the half\nof period of oscillations at this station denoted in Fig. 14b as\nTA. During the event on 18 March 2002, the proton auro-\nras occurred at latitudes of BJN (see Fig. 6a), and the time\nAnn. Geophys., 28, 247\u2013265, 2010 www.ann-geophys.net\/28\/247\/2010\/\nV. Safargaleev et al.: Geomagnetic disturbances on ground during SC 263\nlag of about 3 min (see Fig. 5) is close to the half-period of\noscillations at this station (see Fig. 14c). In our reasoning\nwe neglected the propagation time of the Alfve\u00b4n wave in the\nionospheric waveguide from the place of the incidence in the\nionosphere to the observational point. In accordance to esti-\nmations by Safargaleev et al. (2004), this time is of the order\nof the temporal resolution of riometric and IMAGE magnetic\ndata.\nThe present method gives the observed value of the propa-\ngation time of the Alfve\u00b4n wave along the magnetic field lines\ninstead of commonly used theoretical estimations or the re-\nsults of in-situ measurements but in the direction perpendic-\nular to the magnetic field (e.g. Wilken et al., 1998). The\nresult obtained may be of a practical importance. At auro-\nral latitudes it may be taken into account in the heating ex-\nperiments aimed at artificial excitation of the magnetosphere\neigen-mode oscillations. At higher latitudes the time lag may\nbe regarded as the response time of the dayside polar iono-\nsphere to the magnetopause processes because the informa-\ntion about these processes is transferred by Alfve\u00b4n waves.\nOne can estimate also an averaged Alfve\u00b4n wave velocity\nalong the magnetic field lines and use this to specify some\ntheoretical models (for instance, the models of Pc 1 \u201cpearls\u201d\npulsations by Trakhtengerts et al., 2000; preliminary impulse\nof SC by Tamao, 1964; etc).\n5 Summary\nWe have examined several cases of magnetosphere compres-\nsion by solar wind pressure pulses using a set of instruments\nin the around-noon sector. We have found that the increase\nin the riometric absorption occurred simultaneously with the\nbeginning of positive or negative magnetic variation in auro-\nral zone and broadband enhancement of magnetic activity in\nthe frequency range above 0.1 Hz. Herewith, the magnetic\nvariations were observed prior to the step-like increase in\nthe magnetic H-component at equatorial stations, so that the\nnegative magnetic variation resembled a typical preliminary\nimpulse of SC. The sign of the disturbance demonstrated an\nanti-correlation with the sign of IMF Bz-component.\nFor some of the considered events, the IMAGE satellite\ndata on electron auroras were available and showed the pre-\ncipitation of auroral electrons together with electrons caus-\ning an increase in riometric absorption. Precipitations in a\nwide energy range could lead to the local enhancement of\nionospheric conductivity and reconfiguration of the current\nsystem.\nUsing the simple model of ionospheric irregularity, we\nhave calculated the polarization electric field outside the ir-\nregularity and corresponding magnetic disturbance on the\nground. The calculations show that the sign of disturbance\ndepends on orientation of the background electric field and\nlocation of the observation point in respect to the irregularity.\nNote, that both factors may be regulated by the conditions in\nthe interplanetary medium, in general, and by the sign of IMF\nBz-component, in particular. For one case of direct measure-\nments of electric field in the place where the electron auroras\n(i.e. ionospheric irregularity) were present, the sign of calcu-\nlated disturbance corresponded to the observed one.\nSince the velocity of precipitating electrons is much larger\nthan that for the MHD-disturbance causing the step-like mag-\nnetic enhancement on the equatorial stations, we suggest the\nionospheric irregularity as a source of the preliminary im-\npulse of SC at high latitudes.\nThe ionospheric irregularity could be also a source of\nthe Alfve\u00b4n-like pulsations following the SC. In such \u201ciono-\nspheric\u201d approach, the period of pulsations is defined by the\npropagation time of the Alfve\u00b4n wave between the conjugate\nhemispheres. Using the method of estimation of propaga-\ntion time suggested earlier by Safargaleev et al. (2003) we\nhave found the pulsations of an appropriate period in our\ndata. However, the ionospheric mechanism does not explain\nthe SC-initiated pulsations with smaller period, which were\nalso observed in the course of our investigation, as well as\nreported by other authors (e.g. Eriksson et al., 2006).\nWhen the absorption measurements are performed with\nhigh temporal resolution, they may be used for the accurate\ntiming of the impact of solar wind irregularity to the mag-\nnetopause. We have found that the absorption started to in-\ncrease simultaneously with the enhancement of the broad-\nband magnetic disturbance. So, the additional instrument,\nwhich might be used for the timing purposes, is the merid-\nional chain of the induction magnetometers.\nWe have also found that SC-associated broadband bursts\nof rising frequency in the band of Pc 1 magnetic pulsations\ncorrelated with the enhancements of proton auroras. This in-\ndicates that the EIC instability should lead both to the burst\ngeneration and proton scattering. However, for detail study\nof this phenomenon the data on proton precipitations are\nneeded of better temporal resolution than the 2-min images\ntaken from the IMAGE satellite.\nIt is known that precipitations in the dayside respond to\nboth SWPP and IMF change. In our study we emphasized\nthe disturbances that occurred on the ground during 1\u20133 min\nafter the solar wind irregularity hits the magnetopause. In\naccordance with Kozlovsky et al. (2007), IMF affects the\nauroras 6\u201320 min after SI. Hence, the preliminary impulse,\nbroadband increase of magnetic disturbances above 0.1 Hz,\nas well as sudden commencement absorption and aurora en-\nhancement may be associated with sudden magnetosphere\ncompression rather than with IMF variations accompanying\nalmost all SWPP events considered.\nAcknowledgements.
