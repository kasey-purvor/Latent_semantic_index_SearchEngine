Here 39 \nwe show that for the solar maximum conditions of 1990-91, the largest annual 40 \nvariation determined from CRRES measurements of plasmaspheric equatorial 41 \nelectron density in the range L=2.5-5.0 occurs at American longitudes (-60\u00b0E), while 42 \nno annual variation occurs at Asian longitudes (+100\u00b0E). Plasmaspheric electron 43 \ndensity is larger in December than in June at most longitudes, from -180\u00b0E eastwards 44 \nto +20\u00b0E. At all other longitudes the density ratio from December to June is very 45 \nclose to 1.0. The largest December\/June density ratio is at L=3.0 at American 46 \nlongitudes (-60\u00b0E). At L=4.5 and above, the annual variation disappears. The lowest 47 \nelectron density values for a given L-shell occur at American longitudes, in June. Ion 48 \ndensities also show significant annual variations, with similar longitudinal and 49 \nseasonal characteristics in the case of IMAGE EUV He+ measurements. Atomic mass 50 \ndensity measurements calculated using the magnetometer cross-phase technique show 51 \nsignificant seasonal variations, but also imply composition changes with longitude. 52 \nUsing the quasilinear PADIE code we calculate the bounce-averaged diffusion rate of 53 \nelectrons by plasmaspheric hiss with a fixed wave intensity. December to June 54 \nvariations in plasmaspheric density, particularly at American longitudes, drive 55 \nchanges in the wave-particle interactions, increasing diffusion into the loss cone by a 56 \nfactor of ~3 at 1 MeV at L=3.0, thus hardening the electron precipitation spectrum 57 \nduring the southern hemisphere winter (in June).  58 \n59 \nIntroduction 59 \n 60 \nThe plasmasphere is a region of low energy (\u2018cold\u2019 i.e., Te ~1 eV) plasma 61 \nsurrounding the Earth, and extending out to L ~2-6 depending on geomagnetic 62 \nlatitude, geomagnetic disturbance levels, and on local time. It is primarily made up of 63 \nelectrons and protons that have diffusively migrated from the underlying ionosphere. 64 \nOverlapping the plasmasphere are regions of high energy (\u2018hot\u2019 i.e., Te ~1 MeV) 65 \nplasma known as the radiation belts. Low frequency radio waves propagating within 66 \nthe plasmasphere can interact with the high energy radiation belt particles, changing 67 \ntheir energy spectra and causing them to precipitate into the Earth\u2019s upper 68 \natmosphere, driving chemical changes [e.g., Rosanov et al., 2005]. Variability in the 69 \nbackground conditions of the plasmasphere is one of the factors in determining the 70 \nefficiency of wave-particle interactions [e.g., Horne et al., 2003], thus influencing the 71 \nresultant particle precipitation into the atmosphere. Here we use CRRES satellite 72 \nmeasurements of \u2018cold\u2019 plasmaspheric equatorial electron density to investigate the 73 \nlongitudinal and annual variations in density in the range L=2.5-5.0, and assess the 74 \neffect on the rate of \u2018hot\u2019 electron precipitation from the overlapping outer radiation 75 \nbelt. 76 \n 77 \nThe annual variation in equatorial plasmaspheric electron density (Neq) has been 78 \nobserved previously. The first observations were made using natural whistler signals, 79 \ntypically at either American or European longitudes [e.g., Helliwell, 1965; Park et al., 80 \n1978; Tarcsai et al., 1988]. In these cases Neq showed a maximum in December and a 81 \nminimum in June, with December larger by a factor of between 1.5-3.0 at L=1.5-2.5, 82 \ndepending on longitude. 83 \n 84 \nMan-made whistler-mode signals from US Naval transmitters were analysed by 85 \nClilverd et al. [1991] and showed a December to June ratio of Neq of 3.0 (2.0) at solar 86 \nminimum (maximum) at L=2.5 in the American longitude sector, and a ratio of 1.4 at 87 \nsolar maximum in the New Zealand\/Pacific longitude sector. Using conjugate 88 \nionosonde pairs such as Wallops Island (37.9\u00b0N, 75.5\u00b0W, L=2.39) and Argentine 89 \nIslands (65.3\u00b0S, 64.3\u00b0W, L=2.44) Clilverd et al. [1991] showed that the seasonal Neq 90 \nvariation was largest at 300\u00b0E geographic (-60\u00b0E) because at that longitude the offset 91 \nof the geomagnetic field configuration relative to geographic coordinates is largest. 92 \nCalculations showed that each field line flux tube is in long-term diffusive 93 \nequilibrium with the underlying ionospheres at the footprints of the field line and the 94 \nannual behaviour of the plasmasphere reflects the local annual variation of the 95 \nnorthern and southern F2 regions linked to it. In Figure 1 we show this variation of the 96 \ngeographic latitude of the footprints of the L=2.5 field line contour, using the IGRF 97 \nmagnetic field model, as a function of geographic longitude. The southern L=2.5 98 \ncontour at -60\u00b0E has an underlying ionosphere that is at high latitude and thus 99 \ncontinually sunlit during the December solstice, and in near continuous darkness 100 \nduring the June solstice. These factors, along with differing horizontal thermospheric 101 \nwinds at such high geographic latitudes driving the ionospheric plasma up the field 102 \nlines, produce significant changes in plasmaspheric density from solstice to solstice. 103 \nClilverd et al. [1991] also suggested that there would be no annual variation at 104 \nAfrican\/Asian longitudes, and that in June global Neq values at L=2.5 would be 105 \nlargely independent of longitude and similar to that observed at -60\u00b0E, i.e., ~1000 106 \nel.cm-3.  107 \n 108 \nThe annual variation in Neq has been modelled with a view to reproducing the 109 \nobservations, and understanding the underlying physical processes responsible. Some 110 \nmodels reproduced the December\/June annual variation at American longitudes, and 111 \nthen made predictions regarding the effect at other longitudes. Early work by 112 \nRasmussen and Schunk [1990] showed a Neq maximum in June rather than December 113 \nas is actually observed \u2013 probably because of the centred dipole model used. 114 \nModelling work undertaken by Rippeth et al. [1991], which included a tilted offset 115 \ndipole in the model, was better able to reproduce the observations at L=2.5 at 116 \nAmerican longitudes. Guiter et al. [1995] modelled plasmaspheric densities at L=2 117 \nand found that Neq was 1.5 times higher in December than in June for 300\u00b0E (-60\u00b0E) 118 \nlongitude. At 120\u00b0E longitude the L=2 Neq was predicted to be higher in June than 119 \nDecember by a factor of 1.2. The underlying mechanism driving the annual variation 120 \nwas considered to be variations in ionospheric O+. 121 \n 122 \nFurther modelling using the field line interhemispheric model (FLIP) indicated that 123 \nthe annual variation at American and Australian longitude sectors were likely to be 6 124 \nmonths out of phase [Richards et al., 2000]. This work concluded that plasmaspheric 125 \nthermal structure, not ionospheric density, should play a key role in producing the 126 \nannual variation at solar minimum. A new approach using dynamical diffusive 127 \nequilibrium, called the global plasmasphere ionosphere density model (GPID), was 128 \nable to reproduce the observed seasonal variations in Neq at L=2.5 during solar 129 \nmaximum, but not at solar minimum [Webb and Essex, 2001].  130 \n 131 \nTo maintain charge neutrality an annual variation in ion concentration would be 132 \nanticipated. Berube et al. [2003] used data from a pair of magnetometers at L=1.74 in 133 \nthe MEASURE array (American longitudes) to determine the plasmapsheric 134 \nequatorial mass density. They observed an annual variation in mass density with 135 \nDecember densities 2-3 times higher than in June. This suggests that the mass 136 \ndensities vary in a similar way to the electron densities. Although at L<2, the annual 137 \nvariation in field line resonance frequencies is due to the influence of O+ in the 138 \nunderlying ionosphere changing the Alfven speed profile along those flux tubes 139 \n[Waters et al., 1994]. 140 \n 141 \nHere we perform a comprehensive study of the longitudinal and seasonal variation 142 \nof the equatorial plasmaspheric electron density in the region 2.5<L<5.0 using data 143 \nfrom the CRRES satellite. We examine the observed Neq radial profiles during solar 144 \nmaximum conditions (1990\/91) at different longitudes and at different times of year, 145 \nand compare the profiles against the commonly used profiles of Carpenter and 146 \nAnderson, 1992. We also investigate the equivalent mass density variations using the 147 \nIMAGE EUV measurements of He+, and atomic mass from the cross-phase analysis 148 \nof ground-based magnetometer data.  The relevance of the plasmaspheric density 149 \nvariations are put into the context of changing wave-particle interactions, and the 150 \nsubsequent deposition of energetic particles into the upper atmosphere.     151 \n 152 \n153 \n 153 \n 154 \nDetermination of electron densities in the plasmasphere 155 \n 156 \nElectron number densities are derived from wave data provided by the Plasma Wave 157 \nExperiment on board the Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES). 158 \nThis satellite, which was launched on 25 July 1990, operated in a highly elliptical 159 \ngeosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 305 km, an apogee of 35,768 km and 160 \nan inclination of 18\u00b0. The orbital period was approximately 10 hours, and the initial 161 \napogee was at a magnetic local time (MLT) of 0800 MLT. The magnetic local time of 162 \napogee decreased at a rate of approximately 1.3 hours per month until the satellite 163 \nfailed on 11 October 1991, when its apogee was at about 1400 MLT. The satellite 164 \nswept through the plasmasphere on average approximately 5 times per day for almost 165 \n15 months. The Plasma Wave Experiment provided measurements of electric fields 166 \nfrom 5.6 Hz to 400 kHz, using a 100 m tip-to-tip long wire antenna, with a dynamic 167 \nrange covering a factor of at least 105 in amplitude [Anderson et al., 1992].  168 \n 169 \nThe sweep frequency receiver, which is used in this study, covered the frequency 170 \nrange from 100 Hz to 400 kHz in four bands with 32 logarithmically spaced steps per 171 \nband, the fractional step separation being about 6.7% across the entire frequency 172 \nrange. Band 1 (100 Hz to 810 Hz) was sampled at one step per second with a 173 \ncomplete cycle time of 32.768 s. Band 2 (810 Hz to 6.4 kHz) was sampled at two 174 \nsteps per second with a complete cycle time of 16.384 s. Band 3 (6.4 to 51.7 kHz) and 175 \nband 4 (51.7 kHz to 400 kHz) were sampled 4 times per second with complete cycling 176 \ntimes of 8.192 s. 177 \nThe electron number density is determined from the electron plasma frequency, fpe, 178 \nusing the standard expression ne = 4\u03c02fpe2\u03b50me\/e2. When emissions at the upper hybrid 179 \nfrequency, fuhr, are well-defined the electron plasma frequency, fpe, is derived from fuhr 180 \nusing the relationship fpe2 = fuhr2 \u2013 fce2, where fce is the electron gyrofrequency, 181 \ndetermined from the CRRES fluxgate magnetometer [Singer et al., 1992]. When the 182 \nupper hybrid frequency cannot be identified the electron plasma frequency is 183 \nestimated from the lower frequency limit of the electromagnetic continuum radiation, 184 \nwhich is taken to be the plasma wave cutoff at the plasma frequency [Gurnett and 185 \nShaw, 1973]. The number densities are initially determined at a temporal resolution of 186 \n8.192 s and subsequently averaged as a function of half orbit (inbound or outbound) 187 \nand L in steps of 0.1L. The position of the CRRES spacecraft is mapped to the 188 \nionosphere at the same temporal resolution using the IGRF 85 model corrected for 189 \nexternal magnetospheric currents by the Olson-Pfitzer tilt dependent static model 190 \n[Olson and Pfitzer, 1977]. This is the standard process used to analyze all CRRES 191 \ndata. The geographic coordinates are then averaged as a function of half orbit and L 192 \nshell in steps of 0.1L. The time in UT, magnetic latitude, magnetic local time and time 193 \nspent in each bin are also recorded at the same resolution.  194 \n 195 \nThe resulting database is subsequently analysed to determine the behaviour of the 196 \nplasmaspheric equatorial number density as a function of geographic longitude and 197 \nfor different L shells and seasons. Throughout this paper we use geographic longitude 198 \nduring discussions of the results and the figures shown. We focus on periods centred 199 \nnear the solstices and use the data from October to February (inclusive) for the 200 \nDecember solstice and from April to August (inclusive) for the June solstice. For each 201 \nseason the data are averaged into bins that are 5o in geographic longitude for L shells 202 \nranging from 2.5 +\/- 0.3 L to 5.0 +\/- 0.3 L in steps of 0.5L. The data are included in 203 \nthe averaging process only when the measurements are made within the plasmasphere 204 \nand when the magnetic latitude of the CRRES spacecraft lies within +\/- 10o of the 205 \nmagnetic equator.  206 \n 207 \nData are selected to be in the plasmasphere using a criterion based on the amplitude 208 \nof the waves in the frequency band fce < f < 2fce. Waves in this frequency band, which 209 \ncontains contributions from both electron cyclotron harmonic waves and thermal 210 \nnoise, tend to be excluded from the high density region inside the plasmapause. 211 \nSpecifically observations in the plasmasphere are identified using the criterion that the 212 \nwave amplitude for frequencies in the range fce < f < 2fce must be less than 0.0005 213 \nmVm-1 [Meredith et al., 2004]. Observations made in regions where this criterion did 214 \nnot hold are assumed to be outside the plasmapause at the time and are excluded from 215 \nthe analysis. In practice although we exclude data during large geomagnetic storms 216 \nusing the wave amplitude criterion we will include some density values when the 217 \nplasmasphere is likely to be in an intermediate refilling state following the storms. 218 \nOverall, our criterion for selecting plasmaspheric measurements is somewhat 219 \nconservative in that we reject ~14% of the data where the ECH waves in the range fce 220 \n< f < 2fce have amplitudes above 0.0005 mV m-1 but the densities are likely to be 221 \nrepresentative of the plasmashere at the time [Meredith et al., 2004]. However, this 222 \ncriterion does reduce the number of low density measurements included in our 223 \nanalysis where the plasmapause is ill-defined, and when the plasmasphere is subject to 224 \nerosion during geomagnetically active periods (i.e., AE >100 nT). 225 \n 226 \nDetermination of ion densities in the plasmasphere 227 \n 228 \nThe ion mass densities presented in this study were calculated using field-line 229 \nresonant frequencies (FLRs) measured from pairs of ground-based magnetometers, 230 \nfollowing the analytical expressions described by Taylor and Walker [1984] and 231 \nWalker et al. [1992]. These assume decoupled toroidal mode oscillations and yield 232 \nessentially identical results to the models described by Orr and Matthew[1971]. 233 \nTechniques for the detection of FLRs were summarized by Menk et al. [1999] and 234 \nMenk et al. [2000]. When examining data from latitudinally-separated 235 \nmagnetometers, the resonant frequency is identified by the peak in H-component 236 \ncross-power and cross-phase, and a unity crossing in H-component power ratio, 237 \napproximately mid-way between the stations. Where only one station is available the 238 \nresonance is indicated by a peak in the power ratio H\/D and a rapid change in 239 \npolarization i.e., in the phase between the H and D components. 240 \n 241 \nThe uncertainty in our calculated mass densities presented in this study (20-242 \n30%) depends mainly on uncertainty in the frequency measurement with uncertainties 243 \ntypically of order 10-15%. Menk et al. [1999] discussed the relationship between 244 \nthese two uncertainties and found the mass density uncertainty to be typically double 245 \nthe uncertainty in frequency measurement. We have assumed a dipole magnetic field, 246 \nand at L=2.5 this introduces negligible error.  247 \n 248 \nMeasurements of the He+ ion density presented in this study were made with 249 \nthe Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUV Imager) on-board the IMAGE spacecraft, by 250 \ndetecting its resonantly-scattered emission at 30.4 nm [Sandel et al., 2001]. The 251 \nIMAGE spacecraft is in an elliptical polar orbit with an apogee altitude of 7.2 Earth 252 \nradii (46,000 km) and a perigee altitude of 1,000 km, and completes one orbit every 253 \n14.2 hours. Effective imaging of the plasmaspheric He+ requires global \u2018snapshots' in 254 \nwhich the high apogee and the wide field of view of the EUV Imager provide in a 255 \nsingle exposure a map of the entire plasmasphere. The 30.4 nm feature is relatively 256 \neasy to measure because it is the brightest ion emission from the plasmasphere, it is 257 \nspectrally isolated, and the background at that wavelength is negligible. Line-of-sight 258 \nmeasurements are easy to interpret because the plasmaspheric He+ emission is 259 \noptically thin, so its brightness is directly proportional to the He+ column abundance. 260 \nThe EUV Imager instrument consists of three identical sensor heads, each having a 261 \nfield of view of 30\u00ba. These sensors are tilted relative to one another to cover a fan-262 \nshaped field of 84\u00ba x 30\u00ba that is swept across the plasmasphere by the spin of the 263 \nsatellite. EUV Imager's spatial resolution is ~0.6\u00ba or ~0.1 Re in the equatorial plane 264 \nseen from apogee. The sensitivity is sufficient to map the position of the plasmapause 265 \nwith a time resolution of 10 minutes or better. 266 \n 267 \nFor this study we selected EUV measurements from times in June and 268 \nDecember 2001. We used 122 images taken from the period 15-17 June and 97 269 \nimages from the period 9-20 December. All images were from quiet times (Kp\u22642), 270 \nchosen to avoid azimuthal structures that often appear during more active times. After 271 \ntransforming each image to the plane of the magnetic equator [Sandel et al., 2003] 272 \nusing magnetic longitude as the azimuthal coordinate, we summed the images to a 273 \nsingle image for each of June and December. The summation omitted the region of 274 \nEarth\u2019s shadow and the overlaps between the three EUV cameras. 275 \n 276 \nWe derived azimuthal profiles of brightness vs. magnetic longitude by 277 \nsampling these composite images in an annulus of width 0.3 L centered at L=2.5 with 278 \na bin size of 5\u00b0 in magnetic longitude. To infer equatorial He+ abundances from the 279 \nmeasured brightness, we used the concept of effective path length described by 280 \nClilverd et al. [2003] and Gallagher et al. [2005].  281 \n 282 \nLongitudinal and seasonal variations in plasmaspheric densities 283 \n 284 \nFigure 2 shows the density variation with longitude from CRRES for December 285 \n(solid line) and June (dashed line) for L=2.5-5.0.  Some of the data shown for 286 \nDecember at L=2.5 are indicated by a dot-dashed line, indicating that they are less 287 \nreliable than the other data. The densities at these longitudes in December were so 288 \nlarge (>2000 el. cm-3) that the upper hybrid frequency could not be determined at all 289 \ntimes, and data from a higher range of L-shells (L=2.7-3.3) were used and linearly 290 \nextrapolated to L=2.5 and shown as the dot-dashed line. Thus the data should be 291 \ntreated as less reliable than the rest shown. However, the same extrapolation 292 \ntechnique used on the L=2.5 June data, and some of the other panels (L=3.0-4.0) 293 \nreproduced the December data to within 5%. We make this extrapolation for the 294 \nL=2.5 December data primarily to allow comparison with previous work, it does not 295 \nmaterially affect any of the conclusions from this paper.   296 \n 297 \nFor L=2.5-3.5 it is clear that the density is much higher in December than June over 298 \nthe longitude range -180\u00b0E to 20\u00b0E. At the remaining longitudes the December and 299 \nJune densities are much more nearly equal, with occasionally the June densities 300 \nexceeding the December ones by up to 10%. The same relationship occurs for the 301 \nhigher L-shell regions (L~4.0), although the data are more sparse because of 302 \nincursions by the plasmapause and hence the plots are somewhat less clear. As 303 \nexpected the average density level decreases with increasing L-shell as the plasma 304 \nfrom the underlying ionosphere diffuses up into ever increasing flux tube volumes. 305 \nThis is true for each season, and every longitude.  306 \n 307 \nThe largest difference in density between December and June occurs at about -60\u00b0E 308 \nlongitude, which is consistent with the conclusions of Clilverd et al. [1991]. At L=2.5 309 \nthe densities in June at this longitude are ~1000 el.cm-3, while the December densities 310 \nare ~2500 el.cm-3. This compares well with the whistler-mode results shown in 311 \nClilverd et al. [1991] which were 1400 el.cm-3 and ~2800 el.cm-3 respectively in June 312 \nand December, at solar maximum. The 10-40% systematically higher results from the 313 \nwhistler-mode signals may be due to a slightly lower average L-shell than L=2.5, i.e., 314 \nL=2.45 [Saxton and Smith, 1989]. If the average whistler-mode L-shell used in 315 \nClilverd et al. [1991] is 0.05 L equatorward of L=2.5 this would make only an 8% 316 \ndifference to the electron density calculations. The extrapolation error of 5% should 317 \nalso be included in this interpretation, suggesting that ~10% of the difference between 318 \nthe two techniques could be due to errors in assumptions made. The remainder may be 319 \ndue to the requirement for whistler-mode signals to propagate in field-aligned electron 320 \ndensity enhancements and suggest that duct enhancements maybe typically 20% of 321 \nthe average electron density levels, in agreement with previous ray-tracing 322 \ncalculations of 10-20% [Strangeways, 1991]. 323 \n 324 \nThe change in the annual variation of Neq with L-shell is shown in Figure 3 as a 325 \nratio of December to June Neq values. Three longitudes are shown, +100\u00b0 (Asia), -60\u00b0 326 \n(America), and -150\u00b0(New Zealand). While not actually at the exact longitude of New 327 \nZealand, the longitude (-150\u00b0) is used because it is the appropriate longitude for the 328 \n\u2018New Zealand\u2019 ground-based whistler-mode data [Clilverd et al., 1992] which showed 329 \nan annual variation ratio of ~1.4. At Asian longitudes there is virtually no annual 330 \nvariation, with the Neq ratio staying within \u00b110% of unity. The American longitudes 331 \nshow a maximum ratio of 2.7 at L=2.5\u20143.5. By L=4.5 the annual variation in Neq 332 \nhas almost disappeared. The New Zealand longitudes show a relatively small annual 333 \nvariation, with a ratio of about 1.5, with a gradual decline in the effect with increasing 334 \nL-shell. 335 \n 336 \nThe radial density profile in the plasmasphere is typically represented as an L-4 337 \ndistribution. The following expression based on the plasmaspheric model of Chappell 338 \net al. [1970] is used to represent the results obtained from whistler-mode signals: 339 \n 340 \nNeq = 3877 Pe2 [2\/L]N  el.cm-3    (1)  341 \n 342 \nwhere Pe is a plasma enhancement factor, usually taken as 1.0, N is the radial power 343 \nlaw, usually assumed to be 4.0, and 3877 el.cm-3 is the electron density at L=2.0. The 344 \nresults of least squares fitting of equation (1) to the data for both +100\u00b0E (Asia) and -345 \n60\u00b0E (American) longitudes in December and June is shown in Figure 4. The values 346 \nof Pe and N are shown in each panel, with the best fit represented by a solid line. The 347 \nNeq data points are shown by diamonds. A dotted reference line using the empirical 348 \nCarpenter and Anderson plasmasphere model [Carpenter and Anderson, 1992] for 349 \nDecember and June during solar maximum conditions (sunspot number, R=150) is 350 \nalso shown. The Carpenter and Anderson model was developed from satellite profiles 351 \nof Neq that included coverage at L \u2264 3, and restricted to those profiles where Neq > 667 352 \nel.cm-3 at L = 3. Profiles were then used until they became irregular at higher L-shells 353 \nor exhibited a steeper negative slope. This, and the requirement that geomagnetic 354 \nactivity had been low for ~20 hours prior to the profile measurement, ensured that the 355 \nmodel represents the quiet-time, saturated plasmasphere. But the CRRES results 356 \nshown in Figure 2 suggest that these electron density restriction at L = 3 would reject 357 \nsome saturated plasmasphere conditions found at American longitudes around the 358 \ntime of the June solstice. We would expect our ECH limitation on the CRRES data 359 \nselection to ensure saturated plasmasphere measurements, but potentially only at L-360 \nshells which are typically unaffected by weak or moderate geomagnetic activity (L < 361 \n4). 362 \n 363 \nIn Figure 4 the CRRES data for Asian longitudes (+100\u00b0E) show little variation 364 \nwith season, with Pe and N values very close to the normal values used, i.e., 1.0 and 4 365 \nrespectively. At American longitudes (-60\u00b0E) there are significant changes in the 366 \nradial profile from December to June. In December the best fit is given by Pe=1.6 and 367 \nN=5. So the L \u2264 3 density levels are elevated compared with normal values and the 368 \nradial profile is steeper than expected. In June Pe=0.75, and N=3.4 and the densities 369 \nare lower than normal, and the radial profile is less steep. Averaged over longitude at 370 \nany given time of year the density profiles should look similar to those given by 371 \nCarpenter and Anderson, because their analysis did not take longitudinal variability 372 \ninto account. In practice this is true for our data until L>3.5, after which the 373 \nconsistently lower densities seen in our data shows clear evidence that our analysis 374 \nincludes some non-saturated density levels, that would have been excluded from the 375 \nCarpenter and Anderson model.  376 \n 377 \nThe annual variation in electron density should be mirrored in the ion density in 378 \norder to conserve charge neutrality in the plasmasphere. In Figure 5 we plot the 379 \nlongitudinal and seasonal variation of He+ abundance derived from the IMAGE EUV 380 \nexperiment [Sandel et al., 2001]. The EUV units are He+ (cm-3), and are taken from 381 \nmeasurements made in June and December 2001. The December EUV values are 382 \nrepresented by crosses, with June values by diamonds. The longitudinal variations in 383 \nHe+ closely match the electron density variations despite being taken from different 384 \nsolar cycles.  385 \n 386 \nTo avoid a bias introduced by the diurnal variation in ion abundance, we 387 \naimed to select times for which the phase of the magnetic longitude system was 388 \nuniformly distributed in magnetic local time. The final set of images chosen was 389 \nimperfect in this regard. Therefore we assessed the possibility that some of the 390 \nstructure in the EUV measurements in Figure 5 could arise from incomplete averaging 391 \nof the diurnal variation over all magnetic longitudes. We created a simple model to 392 \ncompute the residual modulation in magnetic longitude that might result from our 393 \nspecific sampling of the diurnal variation. It showed a modulation of lower amplitude, 394 \nhaving a shape different from the structure in Figure 5. We conclude that imperfect 395 \naveraging of the diurnal variation does not significantly bias the structure measured in 396 \nlongitude. 397 \n 398 \nIon number densities have been calculated for Figure 5 using cross-phase analysis 399 \n[Menk et al., 1999] for the longitudes of -65\u00b0E and -10\u00b0E at L=2.5 for December\/June 400 \n2001. These data are shown in Figure 5 as squares (December) and triangles (June), 401 \nand also indicate a strong annual variation in density at the longitudes observed. The 402 \npair of magnetometer stations used for the -65\u00b0E values is Millstone Hill and APL 403 \nfrom the MEASURE array, and the -10\u00b0E values are Hartland and York from the 404 \nSAMNET array. Both midpoints are close to L=2.5, but have been normalised to 405 \nexactly L=2.5 assuming a radial L-4 variation. The ion values plotted at -65\u00b0E have 406 \nbeen adjusted by a factor of 1.3 in order to convert atomic mass units to number 407 \ndensities, and to make the plotted points match the electron densities at that longitude. 408 \nThe adjustment value suggests 11% composition of He+ and the EUV data suggest 409 \n~20%.  These results are consistent with the H+\/He+ composition during quiet times.  410 \nEnvironmental differences due to different sampling times, and differences due to 411 \ndifferent techniques may be adequate to account for the differences observed here. 412 \nHowever, the ion values at -10\u00b0E have been adjusted by a factor of 2.1. Although the 413 \ndata clearly shows the annual variation in density, the adjustment factor is much 414 \nlarger than expected and is consistent with significant heavy ion loading at these 415 \nlongitudes, i.e., about 6% O+. However, this result is not inconsistent with the results 416 \nfrom Sutcliffe et al. [1987] who found increasing plasma mass density with longitude 417 \neastwards towards 20\u00baE in June at L~1.78, due to increased O+ concentrations at 1000 418 \nkm, probably driven by vertical ion drifts from meridional winds in the upper 419 \nionosphere. 420 \n 421 \nImplications for electron precipitation 422 \n 423 \nThe background electron density in the plasmasphere plays a key role in 424 \ndetermining the resonant energy of wave-particle interactions. In this section we 425 \ninvestigate the influence that the annual variation in electron density will have on 426 \npitch-angle scattering of energetic electrons into the loss cone, out of the radiation 427 \nbelts, and subsequent precipitation into the atmosphere.  428 \n 429 \nMeredith et al. [2006] calculated loss timescales for pitch angle scattering by 430 \nplasmaspheric hiss using the PADIE code [Glauert and Horne, 2005] with wave 431 \nproperties based on CRRES observations. The determination of the diffusion 432 \ncoefficients requires knowledge of the distribution of the wave power spectral density 433 \nwith frequency and wave normal angle, together with the ratio fp\/fce, wave mode, and 434 \nthe number of resonances. The ratio fpe\/fce is dependent on the background electron 435 \ndensity, and the background magnetic field. 436 \n 437 \nHere we analyse the effect of differing levels of plasmaspheric density at L=3.0 using 438 \nthe PADIE code. Following the analysis of Meredith et al. [2006] we use similar 439 \nparameters to model the wave interactions. Since energetic outer zone electron loss 440 \ntimescales inside the plasmasphere can be explained by wave particle interactions 441 \nwith plasmaspheric hiss propagating at small or intermediate wave normal angles (\u03c8), 442 \nwe assume a Gaussian angular spread in X, where X = tan \u03c8, with a width 443 \ncorresponding to \u03c8 = 20\u00b0. Since wave propagation at an angle to B is included, we 444 \ncalculate the diffusion rates for Landau (n=0) and \u00b110 cyclotron harmonic resonances. 445 \nWe assume a wave power of 900 pT2 and that the wave spectra intensity peaks at 0.55 446 \nkHz, with a bandwidth of 0.3 kHz and lower and upper cut-offs of 0.1 kHz and 2.0 447 \nkHz respectively. Following Lyons et al. [1972] we calculate the bounce-averaged 448 \ndiffusion rate which takes into account the scattering of particles in pitch angle over 449 \nthe complete range of latitudes between the mirror points.  450 \n 451 \nWe use values of the ratio fpe\/fce that are equivalent to electron density levels of 452 \n1500 el.cm-3 (fpe\/fce=10.8), 1000 el.cm-3 (fpe\/fce=8.8), and 500 el.cm-3 (fpe\/fce=6.2). 453 \nThe PADIE code assumes a dipole magnetic field, and we use values of fpe\/fce that 454 \nare calculated at the L=3.0 geomagnetic equator. These density levels represent 455 \nconditions at L=3.0 for American longitudes in December  (1500 el.cm-3) and June 456 \n(500 el.cm-3) taken from Figure 2, and the Asian longitudes for most times of the year 457 \n(1000 el.cm-3). The pitch angle diffusion coefficients are shown in Figure 6. The 458 \nfpe\/fce conditions are shown, with the bounce-averaged diffusion coefficient (<D\u03b1\u03b1>) 459 \nplotted against electron pitch angle for 3 different electron energies.  At times the 460 \nbounce-averaged diffusion coefficient becomes extremely small and lies off the plot 461 \nfor large ranges of pitch angle. The 100 keV results for pitch angles <65\u00b0 (long 462 \ndashed line) during low plasmaspheric density conditions (fpe\/fce=6.2) is an example.  463 \nThe plot shows that for 100 keV electrons the diffusion rate at the edge of the loss 464 \ncone (vertical dot-dashed line at pitch angles of ~10\u00b0) is reduced by a factor of  ~5 as 465 \nthe plasmasphere becomes depleted to density levels equivalent of American 466 \nlongitudes around the June solstice. However, 1 MeV electron diffusion rates increase 467 \nby a factor of ~3. Thus between December and June hiss driven precipitation into the 468 \natmosphere will become spectrally harder at American longitudes. At Asian 469 \nlongitudes, represented by fpe\/fce=8.8, there would be little change in the 470 \nprecipitation particle energy spectra with season since fpe\/fce hardly changes. 471 \n 472 \nDiscussion 473 \n 474 \nUsing CRRES observations set we have shown that the maximum amplitude of the 475 \nannual variation in electron density is at American longitudes (about -60\u00b0E). This is in 476 \ngood agreement with the analysis of Clilverd et al. [1991], and it seems very likely 477 \nthat this is primarily caused by the influence of the Earth\u2019s tilted-offset dipole 478 \nmagnetic field on the diffusive equilibrium conditions along the plasmaspheric field 479 \nlines, as represented by Figure 1 of this paper. The annual variation has an amplitude 480 \nof 2.7 at L=2.5 at solar maximum for American longitudes, which agrees with the 481 \ncorresponding densities derived from ground-based observations of whistler-mode 482 \nsignals. At New Zealand longitudes the ratio from CRRES observations was 1.5 for 483 \nL=2.5, which is also very close to the value found from whistler-mode signals taken 484 \nduring the same period. 485 \n 486 \nSeveral of the plasmaspheric models predicted that at Asian longitudes (+100\u00b0E) the 487 \nJune densities would exceed the December densities, by typically a ratio of 1.2 488 \n[Guiter et al., 1995; Richards et al., 2000]. This result is not observed in the CRRES 489 \ndata, where the ratio is 1.0 at almost all of the L-shells at this longitude. Guiter et al. 490 \n[1995] predicted that the December to June density ratio would increase slightly with 491 \nincreasing L-shell. This is not observed at any of the longitudes studied in detail. 492 \n 493 \nThe CRRES data shows that the June electron density levels at American longitudes 494 \nare lower than for any other longitude. Clilverd et al. [1991] suggested that in June 495 \nthere would be very little longitudinal variation in electron density, and estimated 496 \nAsian June density levels of 1000 el.cm-3.   This estimate was based on conjugate 497 \npairs of ionosonde data, since no suitable whistler-mode data was available for the 498 \nAsian sector. For the African\/Asian longitudes Nurmijarvi (60.5\u00b0N, 24.6\u00b0E) and 499 \nKerguelen (49.4\u00b0S, 70.2\u00b0E) were analysed \u2013 mainly because of the lack of choice of 500 \nionosonde stations in the southern hemisphere at these longitudes. These stations 501 \nrepresent L=3.0-3.5 conditions rather than L=2.5, and Figure 2 shows that typical 502 \nAsian electron density levels at these L-shells of ~3.0 are ~1000 el.cm-3, thus 503 \nexplaining how the Asian sector equatorial electron density estimates of Clilverd et al. 504 \n[1991] were too low. The longitudinal variation of Neq in June, although not 505 \npreviously predicted, is consistent with a tilted offset dipole magnetic field effect on 506 \nplasmaspheric diffusive equilibrium conditions. 507 \n 508 \nIn Figure 4 we plotted the CRRES Neq results in comparison with the model of 509 \nCarpenter and Anderson [1992] based on ISEE satellite data. The Carpenter and 510 \nAnderson (C&A) model results for December at solar maximum agree reasonably 511 \nwell with the L=2.5-4.0 CRRES Neq at American longitudes (-60\u00b0E). At higher L-512 \nshells the CRRES satellite observes lower density levels than the C&A model; this 513 \nmay possibly be due to the CRRES data including unsaturated plasmasphere 514 \nconditions. In June at American longitudes (-60\u00b0E) the C&A model over estimates the 515 \nelectron density level consistently at all L-shells, and in December L-shells greater 516 \nthan L=3.5 have consistently lower CRRES density levels than C&A. This appears to 517 \nbe in part because of the influence of some unsaturated plasmasphere Neq values in 518 \nthe CRRES data, and also because of the lack of a longitudinal component in the 519 \nannual density variation of C&A. 520 \n 521 \nUsing the PADIE code and holding all variables constant apart from the background 522 \nelectron density we find that hiss driven precipitation into the atmosphere will become 523 \nspectrally harder at American longitudes as the season changes from December to 524 \nJune. At Asian longitudes there would be little change in the precipitation particle 525 \nenergy spectra with season. An additional influence of the changing background 526 \ndensity in the plasmasphere could be on the generation and amplification of the hiss 527 \nwaves themselves. If the source of free energy to drive the waves remains the same, 528 \nthen reducing (increasing) the electron density should increase (decrease) the band of 529 \nfrequencies generated, affecting the resonant energies. So, although here we have 530 \nshown that the annual changes in background electron density have an influence on 531 \nthe dynamics of radiation belt particles, the picture is far from complete and requires 532 \nfurther study.  Additionally, experimental evidence of this effect on the radiation belt 533 \nparticles has yet to be published. 534 \n 535 \nSummary 536 \n 537 \n We have used CRRES measurements of plasmaspheric equatorial electron density 538 \nat solar maximum to investigate the longitudinal and annual variation in density in the 539 \nrange L=2.5-5.0. We find that the largest annual variation occurs at American 540 \nlongitudes (-60\u00b0E), and that no annual variation occurs at Asian longitudes (+100\u00b0E). 541 \nThese findings are in agreement with Clilverd et al. [1991]. The underlying cause is 542 \ndue to the influence of a tilted-offset dipole geomagnetic field. At American 543 \nlongitudes there is the largest discrepancy between geomagnetic latitude and 544 \ngeographic latitude. This leads to substantial annual variations in ionospheric plasma 545 \ndensity, which map up into the plasmasphere as a consequence of diffusive 546 \nequilibrium. 547 \n 548 \nPlasmaspheric electron density is larger in December than in June in the region 549 \ncovering -180\u00b0E to +20\u00b0E. Elsewhere the ratio of December to June is very close to 550 \n1.0. The annual variation also differs with L-shell. At American longitudes (-60\u00b0E), 551 \nand possibly at New Zealand longitudes, the maximum December\/June ratio is at 552 \nL=2.5-3.5, with a value of 2.7 at American longitudes at solar maximum. At L=4.5 553 \nand above the annual variation disappears, possibly because the plasmasphere is not in 554 \ndiffusive equilibrium with the ionosphere at these high L-shells, or the inclusion of 555 \nnon-saturated electron density values from CRRES observations. The lowest electron 556 \ndensity values for a given L-shell occur at American longitudes. This is particularly 557 \nclear for the lower L-shells, although apparent as far out as L=4.5. These values occur 558 \nin June. Clearly the plasmasphere is strongly controlled by the configuration of the 559 \nEarth\u2019s magnetic field and the annual variations in the F2 regions that are in diffusive 560 \nequilibrium with it.    561 \n 562 \nIon densities also show significant annual variations. There are similar longitudinal 563 \ncharacteristics in the case of IMAGE EUV He+ measurements taken during June and 564 \nDecember 2001. However, there are as yet unexplained differences in atomic mass 565 \ndensity measurements calculated using the magnetometer cross-phase technique, 566 \nwhere European values are significantly higher than those at American longitudes and 567 \nrequire a large correction factor for the ion composition. 568 \n 569 \nCalculations of the effect of changing plasmaspheric density on wave-particle 570 \ninteractions with plasmaspheric hiss indicate that the depletion of the plasmasphere at 571 \nAmerican longitudes in June results in a harder energy spectrum of electrons being 572 \nprecipitated into the atmosphere at those longitudes than anywhere else. Conversely, 573 \nthe softest energy spectrum occurs at the same longitudes in December. Little 574 \nvariation in precipitation energy spectrum is likely at Asian longitudes due to the 575 \nabsence of any significant annual variation in plasmaspheric density. 576 \n577 \n 577 \nReferences 578 \n 579 \nAnderson, R.
