The\nsensitivity to hard X-rays (not attained by previous mis-\nsions like Einstein and ROSAT ) allows the detection and\nstudy of the most energetic objects in the Universe (Active\nGalactic Nuclei { AGN), most of which are believed to be\ndeeply hidden inside large amounts of absorbing gas and\ninconspicuous at virtually all other wavelengths.\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or \nhttp:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20011615\nX. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey 523\nDuring science observations (with exposure time over\n\u001810 ks) with the EPIC cameras operating in \\Full Frame\"\nmode (Turner et al. 2001; Stru\u00a8der et al. 2001) XMM-\nNewton is discovering \u001830\u2212150 new X-ray sources, which\nadd to the XMM-Newton serendipitous survey at an ex-\npected rate of \u001850 000 new sources per year. The XMM-\nNewton Survey Science Centre (SSC) was appointed by\nESA to exploit scienti\fcally the XMM-Newton serendipi-\ntous survey for the bene\ft of the scienti\fc community and\nas a major legacy of XMM-Newton to future generations.\nThis is being tackled by the SSC consortium in terms of a\nmostly ground-based optical follow-up and identi\fcation\n(XID) programme.\nThe XID programme has been described in detail\nin Watson et al. (2001). Briefly, its implementation has\nbeen divided into two parts: a core programme which\nwill identify { spectroscopically { signi\fcant samples of\nsources at X-ray flux limits around \u001810\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(bright sample), \u001810\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (medium sample)\nand \u001810\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (faint sample) covering a range\nof galactic latitudes, and an imaging programme aiming at\nproviding deep optical\/infrared images in several colours\nof a large number of XMM-Newton \felds to facilitate sta-\ntistical identi\fcations of the serendipitous sources.\nAXIS (\\An XMM-Newton International Survey\")1\nforms the backbone of the XID programme by provid-\ning the ground-based resources that are essential for the\nexploitation of the XMM-Newton serendipitous sky sur-\nvey. Besides making a \frst and major contribution to\nthe XID programme, AXIS will de\fne the quality stan-\ndard and will guide future steps in the implementation of\nthe XID programme. AXIS has been conceived and de-\nsigned to make optimal use of the available instrumenta-\ntion on the telescopes of the Observatorio del Roque de los\nMuchachos. AXIS has been awarded a total of 85 observ-\ning nights spread over the period April 2000{April 2002\non the 4 larger telescopes of the Observatorio del Roque\nde Los Muchachos: the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope\n(INT), the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), the\n3.5 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) and the 4.2 m\nWilliam Herschel Telescope (WHT).\nIn this paper we report on the \frst results obtained\nin the AXIS medium sensitivity survey at high galac-\ntic latitude. X-ray sources serendipitously found in two\nXMM-Newton observations (\feld names G133-69 Pos 2\nand Mkn 205) have been studied and followed up down to\na 0.5{4.5 keV flux of 2 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. The survey\nreaches a source density in excess of 100 sources deg\u22122,\nwhich is appropriate for spectrocopic follow up using \f-\nbre spectroscopy. Our survey is therefore shallower than\nthe XMM-Newton Lockman Hole survey (Hasinger et al.\n2001) and the Chandra deep surveys (Mushotzky et al.\n2000; Barger et al. 2001; Giacconi et al. 2001). The surface\ndensity reached is, however, similar to that of the so-called\nRosat Deep Survey (Boyle et al. 1994) and deeper than the\nRIXOS survey (Mason et al. 2000).\n1 See http:\/\/www.ifca.unican.es\/~xray\/AXIS\nAlthough we are still dealing with a small number of\nsources (29) the sample presented here provides a flavour\nof the dominant X-ray source populations at high galactic\nlatitude down to that flux level. The paper also describes\nthe observational techniques that we are following in the\nAXIS project to build up larger source catalogues at var-\nious flux levels and galactic latitudes.\n2. The X-ray data\n2.1. XMM-Newton observations\nThe identi\fcations presented in this paper correspond to\nX-ray sources serendipitously found in 2 XMM-Newton\nimages (G133-69 Pos 2 and Mkn 205). G133-69 Pos 2 was\nobserved as a Guaranteed Time observation to probe the\ngalactic halo using X-ray shadows. It consists of a single\ndata set totalling 16 ks of good exposure time in full frame\nmode. The Mkn 205 \feld was observed as a calibration\nobservation, and consists of 3 exposures of 17 ks each.\nOne of these is in large-window mode (for the EPIC pn\ncamera) which only covers half of the \feld of view. The\nremaining 2 data sets are in full window mode, and we\nmerged them. One of these was free of particle background\nflares, but the other one was strongly contaminated and\nonly <3 ks of it survived the cleaning process. Details of\nthe X-ray observations are reported in Table 1.\nBoth of these observations have been processed\nthrough the pipeline processing system2 (Watson et al.\n2001), using tasks from the XMM-Newton Science\nAnalysis Software (SAS) v5.1. Subsequent analyses were\nalso performed using the same version of the SAS. All\nevent patterns (single, double and triple) were kept when\nconstructing the event \fles. This provides maximum sen-\nsitivity at high photon energies but the fraction of non-X-\nray events rejected is consequently smaller. When flaring\nintervals are removed from the event lists, higher S\/N is\nusually achieved by keeping all patterns.\nThe pipeline processing source searching procedure\nhas been adopted. We now sketch briefly its main fea-\ntures. We have used data from EPIC-pn because its sen-\nsitivity doubles that of the invidual EPIC-MOS detec-\ntors. Images were extracted in the following 4 spectral\nbands: 0.5{2 keV, 2{4.5 keV, 4.5{7.5 keV and 7.5{10 keV.\nExposure maps, which account for vignetting, CCD gaps,\nbad columns and bad pixels, were constructed for each\nband. The combination of the 4 images was used to search\nfor sources with an overall likelihood above 16. This cor-\nresponds to a probability of a source being spurious of\n\u00188 \u0002 10\u22125, i.e., up to one spurious detection per image\nwith that likelihood.\nFirst, a simple sliding box algorithm was applied to\nmask out the brightest sources and to spline-\ft the back-\nground in each CCD chip. The sliding box algorithm was\napplied again to search for sources signi\fcant against the\n\ftted background. Finally a maximum likelihood \ft of the\n2 See http:\/\/xmmssc-www.star.le.ac.uk\n524 X.

Sources were sorted in\nterms of the flux in the 0.5{4.5 keV flux. Table 1 lists the\ncountrate to flux conversion factors for both \felds which\nwe derived assuming a standard \u0393 = 1:7 power law ab-\nsorbed by the galactic column. Fluxes are corrected for\ngalactic absorption. We experimented with variations in\nthe spectral shape of the sources and found changes of\nup to 15% only in the conversion factor when varying the\nspectral index from \u0393 = 1:5 to \u0393 = 2. That was expected\nas the 0.5{4.5 keV band was selected because of the fairly\nflat sensitivity of XMM-Newton accross the whole band.\nAs there are still issues regarding the processing and cal-\nibration of EPIC data (out-of-time events, multiple pat-\ntern events, etc.), our listed fluxes have to be understood\nmodulo these uncertainties.\nFor each 0.5{4.5 keV image we also extracted a sen-\nsitivity map (using the SAS task esensmap) showing the\nminimum count rate that a point source must have to be\ndetectable by the algorithm used, at every position of the\ndetector. We choose a likelihood limit of 10 (as opposed\nto 16) since we are dealing with a single band. This gives\na probability \u00184:5 \u0002 10\u22125 for a spurious detection in a\nsingle band (again \u00181 spurious detection per image), sim-\nilar to the multi-band source search. This map takes into\naccount vignetting, inter-CCD gaps and bad pixels and\ncolumns. We then computed the total solid angle where a\nsource brighter than any given flux limit would have been\ndetected. In the case of the Mkn 205 we further excluded a\ncircle of radius 2 arcmin around the target. The \feld also\nhappens to contain an extended source which we identi-\n\fed as the galaxy NGC 4291. The extent of this X-ray\nsource e\u000bectively masks out a circle of 1.5 arcmin radius\naround it where the much enhanced background due to\nextended X-ray emission prevents us from detecting any\nfurther X-ray sources. We therefore included this galaxy\nas a serendipitous source in our survey but ignored any\nother possible sources within a circle of 1.5 arcmin radius\naround it. Figure 1 shows the solid angle surveyed at each\nflux level. At 2 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, which is our survey\nlimit, we have surveyed 0.26 deg2.\n2.2. X-ray sources\nThe source-searching algorithms produced a number of\nsources in each \feld (37 and 52 in the G133-69 Pos 2\nand Mkn 205 data respectively), some as faint as 5 \u0002\n10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (all fluxes refer to the 0.5{4.5 keV\nband). The faintest of these sources have likelihood de-\ntections very close to our threshold. When truncating\nat a flux of 2 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 a total of 12 and\n17 X-ray sources were found in the G133-69 Pos 2 and\nMkn 205 \felds respectively. Two sources in the Mkn 205\n\feld whose positions fall in CCD gaps have already been\nexcluded from the list. The sensivity of both \felds was\nclearly enough to ensure completeness at that flux level,\ni.e., sources signi\fcantly fainter than our survey limit were\ndetected in each \feld. Care was taken to visually screen\nthe source lists in order to clean it from artifacts derived\nfrom the proximity of inter-CCD gaps, bad columns or\nother cosmetic e\u000bects.\nThe X-ray source list was then astrometrically cor-\nrected. The pipeline-processed data provides astrometry\ndrawn from the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS),\nwhich we believe to be good to within a few arcsec. To\nfurther improve that, we cross-correlated the source posi-\ntions of the X-ray sources obtained with a list of optical\nsources obtained from the i0-band images (see Sect. 3.1)\nusing the SAS task eposcorr. To this goal, we used all de-\ntected X-ray sources and all detected optical sources in the\n\feld to maximize the number of matches. The situation\nis summarized in Table 2, were we show that signi\fcant\nastrometric shifts were still present in both data sets. One\npoint that needs stressing is that the number of X-ray to\noptical matches is much larger when we use the full cata-\nlogue of optical sources obtained in our wide-\feld images\nthan if we used, e.g., the USNO A2 (Monet et al. 1998)\ncatalogued sources. In that case we would be restricted to\n\u001810 matches per \feld, with the corresponding uncertainty\nX. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey 525\nFig. 2.

We further dis-\ncuss the accuracy of the astrometric solution in the X-ray\nimages in Sect. 5.1. Table 3 lists the X-ray sources brighter\nthan our survey limit with the astrometrically corrected\npositions.\nIn order to gain X-ray spectral information on the\nX-ray sources, we used the count rates in individual bands\nto construct the following hardness ratios:\nHR1 =\nC(2\u22124:5 keV)\u2212 C(0:5\u22122 keV)\nC(2\u22124:5 keV) + C(0:5\u22122 keV)\nand\nHR2 =\nC(4:5\u221210 keV)\u2212 C(2\u22124:5 keV)\nC(4:5\u221210 keV) + C(2\u22124:5 keV) \u0001\nNote that these are computed using the exposure-map cor-\nrected count-rates, so that energy dependent vignetting\nis approximately corrected. All sources in the sample se-\nlected here had positive count rates in all bands.Also, note\nthat the typical number of counts per source is fairly small\nand therefore a detailed individual spectral analysis of\neach source is di\u000ecult and beyond the scope of this paper.\nTable 3 contains the basic X-ray data on these sources.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the integrated source counts derived\nfrom this survey. The source density at the survey limit is\n113\u000621 sources deg\u22122. This curve is to be compared with\nthe ROSAT source counts (Hasinger et al. 1998) which we\nconverted to our 0.5{4.5 keV band by using a \u0393 = 2 spec-\ntrum which is consistent with the average value of HR1\n(see below). Our source counts are \u001860% higher than the\nROSAT ones at the survey limit. Choosing a conversion\nfactor corresponding to a power-law with spectral index\n\u0393 = 1:7 just brings the ROSAT curve up by \u001815%, still\nsigni\fcantly below our source counts.\nWe also compare the source counts with those de-\nrived in the 2{10 keV from ASCA (Ueda et al. 1999) and\nChandra (Mushotzky et al. 2000). Note that the Baldi\net al. (2001) source counts, based on XMM-Newton data,\nare consistent with these earlier work. Here a conversion\nfactor for \u0393 = 1:6 has been applied, which is consistent\nwith the value of HR2 (see below). Our source counts fall\nmodestly below (17%, only \u00181 sigma signi\fcant) those in\nthe harder band at the survey limit. It is clear that by\nselecting in the 0.5{4.5 keV band we \fnd a large fraction\nof the sources that ROSAT missed, but we may still be\nmissing a small fraction of the hard sources detected in\nthe 2{10 keV band.\nFigure 3 shows the hardness ratios for the sources as a\nfunction of flux. We must caution that although the two\n\felds under consideration have di\u000berent Galactic absorb-\ning columns and furthermore have been observed with dif-\nferent EPIC-pn \flters (thin and medium, see Table 1), the\ne\u000bect of both of these facts on the hardness ratios (par-\nticularly HR1) is completely negligible. No obvious trend\nof the source spectra is seen with source flux. The so-\ncalled spectral paradox (Fabian & Barcons 1992), i.e., the\nsource\u2019s spectra being steeper than the X-ray background\nspectrum (\u0393 \u0018 1:4), is therefore not obviously solved at\nthis flux level, i.e., we do not \fnd a signi\fcant sample of\nsources that have an X-ray spectrum close to that of the\nX-ray background. This is also revealed by the histograms\nof HR1 and HR2 which are shown in Fig. 4 together with\nthe expected values for various power laws with galactic\nabsorption. The weighted averages of the hardness ratios\nare hHR1i = \u22120:69 \u0006 0:03 and hHR2i = \u22120:37 \u0006 0:03,\nconsistent with a fairly steep X-ray spectrum (\u0393 = 1.6{\n2.0). Further details on the X-ray spectra of the di\u000berent\nsource classes are given in Sect. 5.2.\n3. Optical observations\n3.1.

Histograms of the values of HR1 and HR2. Marks for\nstandard power-law spectra with various values of the photon\nspectral index \u0393 are shown.\nAstrometric calibration was performed in two di\u000berent\nways. First a 12 parameter plate solution was applied to\neach one of the 4 CCDs of the WFC independently, by\nmatching sources found in the image to USNO source po-\nsitions. Residuals were typically found to be of the order\nof 0.3 arcsec for \u0018100\u2212200 matched sources. A second as-\ntrometric calibration (along the lines of the WFC survey)\nwas performed by a simple 6 parameter plate solution over\nthe whole 4-CCD image, but taking into account the pre-\nviously calibrated telescope distortion cubic term. In this\ncase the sources found were matched to APM source posi-\ntions with similar residuals. We found the position of the\ncandidate counterparts to X-ray sources to be consistent\nin both methods to within <0:5 arcsec.\n3.2. Selection of candidate counterparts\nIn order to search for candidate counterparts of the X-ray\nsources, we have used the i0-band WFC image. Optical\nsource lists for these images have been constructed by us-\ning the Sextractor algorithm (Bertin & Arnouts 1996).\nSources were recorded if a minimum number of 10 con-\nnected pixels (of 0.33 arcsec) lay above 2 standard devi-\nations of the background. Indeed some very faint sources\nescaped this detection algorithm, but the impact on the\nsearch for candidate counterparts was very limited.\n528 X. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey\nCounterparts for the X-ray sources were searched for\nin the optical image lists. Candidate counterparts had to\nbe either within the 5\u001b statistical error or within 5 arcsec\nfrom the position of the X-ray source. This last criterion\nwas used to accommodate any residual systematics in the\nastrometric calibration of the X-ray EPIC images.\nThe result of this search was very encouraging. Out of\nthe 29 X-ray sources, 24 showed a single candidate coun-\nterpart, 4 showed two candidate counterparts and the re-\nmaining source showed no or very faint candidate coun-\nterpart in the i0-band image. The two basic conclusions to\nextract from this are that the selection of \flter and depth\nof the images are appropriate to this sample and that\nthe X-ray positional errors provided by XMM-Newton are\ngood enough to single out a unique counterpart for the\nvast majority of the high-galactic latitude sources.\n3.3. Spectroscopic observations\nCandidate counterparts were spectroscopically observed\nwith various spectrographs in order to identify the nature\nof the sources. Table 5 lists the relevant parameters of the\nspectroscopic instrumental setup used. At the source den-\nsity we are dealing with (\u0018100 deg\u22122) \fbre spectrographs\nare likely to be the most e\u000ecient. However, we had a very\nlimited amount of nights with this instrumentation and\nfurthermore the \fbres used were too large (2.7 arcsec di-\nameter) to detect the faintest objects. Therefore a signif-\nicant fraction of the sources were identi\fed with long-slit\nspectrographs.\nAs pointed out before, the vast majority of X-ray\nsources have a unique candidate counterpart. For the cases\nwhere there were two candidate counterparts we observed\nthe brightest one (which happened also to be the closest\none to the X-ray source) which invariably turned out to\nbe a plausible identi\fcation (i.e. some sort of AGN).\nThe spectra were reduced using standard IRAF tech-\nniques. These included de-biasing, flat \felding, illumina-\ntion correction (whenever a twilight flat was available),\ncosmic ray rejection, spectral extraction and background\nsubtraction, arc lamp wavelength calibration and flux cal-\nibration by using spectrophotometric standards. The flux\ncalibration does not have to be understood in absolute\nterms, as signi\fcant fractions of the light escaped the cor-\nresponding apertures and no attempt has been made to\ncorrect for this. Nevertheless the overall spectral shape, if\nnot the normalisation, should be approximately correct.\nThat is especially true for the long-slit spectra which in\nthe majority of the cases were obtained with the slit ori-\nented in parallactic angle.\nThe case of \fbre spectroscopy deserves further com-\nment. The relative \fbre throughput was obtained by ob-\nserving in o\u000bset sky positions within the same \fbre con-\n\fguration under use. In the proper on-target observations,\nthe sky was subtracted by combining all the sky \fbres that\nwe placed in regions free from bright sources. We applied\nthe same procedure to the o\u000bset sky observations, which\nallowed us to tweak the relative sensitivity of the \fbres\nby making sure that no signi\fcant residuals were left in\nthese spectra after the sky was subtracted. In a couple of\niterations we found a satisfactory solution for the relative\n\fbre sensitivity and then we used this to sky-subtract the\ntarget apertures. It must be stressed that sky lines are\nvery di\u000ecult to subtract at this spectral resolution and\ntherefore residuals will unavoidably be present in the \f-\nbre spectra.\nWe must emphasize that \fbre spectroscopy, even with\nthe large \fbre aperture of 2.7 arcsec, was very e\u000ecient\nin identifying the optically brightest conterparts in the\nMkn 205 \feld. We allocated a total of 26 \fbres on optical\nsources in a single setup, which included several corre-\nsponding to X-ray sources below the flux cuto\u000b. We suc-\nceeded in identifying 8 X-ray sources above the flux cuto\u000b\nand a futher 3 below it in a total time of 2.5 hours in-\ncluding all overheads. This is at least twice as e\u000ecient as\nlong-slit spectroscopy on the same telescope.\nThis high e\u000eciency in the \fbre spectroscopy relied,\nhowever, on two basic facts: the night was dark (so the\nsky background and noise were as low as possible) and\nthe number of X-ray sources with a single candidate coun-\nterpart was very large. It must be pointed out that \fbre\nspectrographs do not usually allow to place \fbres within\nseveral arcsec at best, and therefore it is not possible to\nobserve di\u000berent candidate counterparts of the same X-ray\nsource within the same \fbre setup.\n4. Identi\fcation of the X-ray sources\nTable 6 lists the optical identi\fcation of the sources to-\ngether with their optical magnitudes. The classi\fcation\nwe have chosen includes several source classes: Broad-\nLine Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGN), Narrow Emission\nLine Galaxies (NELG, which invariably turned out to\nbe Narrow-Line AGN), non-emission line galaxies (Gal),\nActive Coronal stars (AC), stars without signs of activity\n(STAR) and clusters of galaxies (Clus).\nFinding charts and spectra of these sources can be\nfound under the AXIS programme web pages (http:\/\/\nwww.ifca.unican.es\/~xray\/AXIS). Here we add some\nnotes on individual objects\nXMMU J010327.3-064643 is the faintest optical source\n(in r0, i0 and Z) with hints of narrow emission lines. We\nhave binned the spectrum into bins of 600 \u0017A each, and ap-\nplied a photometric redshift technique using a set of galaxy\ntemplates as in Fern\u0013andez-Soto et al. (1999). The mini-\nmum \u001f2 happens at z = 1:01, which allows us to interpret\nan apparently narrow emission line as CIII], and a dubi-\nous [OII]. We therefore tentatively classify this source as\na NELG, although its high luminosity (1:8\u0002 1044 erg s\u22121)\nwould promote it to QSO2. The optical colours of this\nsource do indeed correspond to a QSO or to a starforming\ngalaxy (see Fig. 6, where this source is the empty circle at\nthe bottom of the graph). The classi\fcation and redshift\nof this source are at present very uncertain.\nX. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey 529\nTable 5.

Optical colour g0 \u2212 i0 as a function of i0-magnitude.\nSymbols as in 3.\nXMMU J122258.1+751934 is a faint source, with a de-\ntected but weak emission line that we believe to be [OII]\nand dubious [OIII] doublet at z = 0:257. Since the spec-\ntrum is very noisy, we applied the photometric redshift\ntechnique to the binned spectrum. The minimum \u001f2 is\nindeed found at z \u0018 0:3.\nXMMU J122120.5+751616 appears to have a very blue\nspectrum, but the H\f line, which is weak, does not appear\nto be broad. On the other hand it has strong [NeV], [OII]\nand [OIII] doublet. Therefore we have classi\fed it as a\nNELG.\nXMMU J010328.7-064633 and XMMU J010316.7-\n065137 appear to be BAL QSOs. They will be discussed\nin Sect. 5.4\nFigure 5 shows the g0\u2212i0 colour of the identi\fed sources\nas a function of their i0-magnitude. As expected, BLAGNs\nare usually bluer than the NELGs where the optical light\nis dominated by the host galaxy rather than by the active\nnucleus.\nTo further explore the optical colours, we plot in Fig. 6\nthe r0 \u2212 i0 versus g0 \u2212 r0 optical colour-colour diagram\nfor the identi\fed sources. We overlay median colours for\nQSOs, as derived from the Sloan Digitized Sky Survey\n(Richards et al. 2001), in the redshift range z = 0{3 and\nfor E\/S0 galaxies, as derived from the Coleman et al.\n(1980) template, in the redshift range z = 0{1.

The influ-\nence of cosmological Lyman-\u000b absorption has not been\nincluded, as it is only relevant in the g0-band for redshifts\nz > 3. Clearly, the X-ray sources classi\fed as BLAGNs\nhave optical colours as expected for QSOs, and the X-ray\nsources identi\fed as NELGs fall in the region where the\ngalaxies lie (either E\/S0 or more likely reddened starform-\ning galaxies). This implies again that in NELGs most of\nthe optical light we see comes from the host galaxy, unlike\nthe X-ray emission which comes from the nucleus.\n4.1.

We then analyzed the\no\u000bsets of the optical position with respect to the X-ray\nposition. These are shown in Fig. 7, where error bars are\njust the X-ray positional errors, which by far dominate\nover the optical position ones.\nAn obvious feature to note is that, apart from the\nsource XMMU J122017.9+752212 which is extended both\nin X-rays and in the optical (NGC 4291), there is no ob-\nvious trend of o\u000bsets being larger for any source class. In\nparticular the sources classi\fed as NELGs (which in fact\nare all AGNs) are unlikely to be chance coincidences, as\nin that case they would exhibit larger o\u000bsets with respect\nto the X-ray sources.\nFigure 8 shows the histogram of these o\u000bsets normal-\nized to their corresponding statistical errors. Assuming\nthat position errors are well reproduced by a Gaussian,\nthis normalized o\u000bset x should be distributed as\nfpos(xjx0) \/j x\u2212 x0 j exp\n(\u2212 j x\u2212 x0 j2 =2\u0001 (1)\nwhere in the absence of systematic shifts x0 = 0. Actually\nx0 measures the magnitude of systematic residuals in units\nof statistical errors. An attempt to \ft the histogram of\nFig. 8 without systematics reveals that it can only re-\nproduce the \frst peak (at around x \u0018 1), but leaves the\nsecond peak unexplained. Then we maximum-likelihood\n\ftted the sum of two of the above functions, one with\nx0 = 0 and a second one with the systematic shift x0\nas a free parameter, the relative contribution of both\nterms being also a free parameter. The result (\ft shown\nin Fig. 8) is that about 83% of the sources have no sig-\nni\fcant systematic shifts and the remaining 17% of the\n532 X. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey\nFig. 8. Histogram of o\u000bsets (Optical { X-ray) scaled to the\ncorresponding statistical uncertainty in the X-ray position. The\nbest \ft accounting for systematics is also shown.\nsources have systematic shifts of \u00184:5 statistical errors\n(typically \u00183\u22124 arcsec).\nA closer inspection of the sources showing residual as-\ntrometric systematics shows that all of them are in the\nMkn 205 \feld, all of them are relatively bright and only\none of them is relatively close to the centre of the \feld\n(but then close enough to the Mkn 205 point-spread func-\ntion tail). We do not fully understand the reason for this,\nbut perhaps it might be related to the overall astromet-\nric solution being dominated by some spurious matches of\nX-ray sources fainter than the ones used in our survey. The\nresiduals are, however, so small that they are irrelevant for\na high galactic latitude \feld. Much more care should be\ntaken, however, in galactic plane \felds where the density\nof optical sources is much larger and chance associations\nmight produce a completely wrong astrometric solution.\nWe suggest in this case to use a very limited number of\nsecure identi\fcations to derive a \frst astrometric correc-\ntion and then iterate as the number of identi\fed sources\ngrows.\n5.2. Overall source populations\nAs expected, the majority of the identi\fed X-ray sources\nare extragalactic (only 1 galactic AC), and in particular\nAGN. Figure 9 shows the optical to X-ray relation for the\nX-ray sources. We see that most, if not all, of the BLAGNs\nwill be identi\fed in the medium sensitivity survey (i.e.\nat a flux limit of 2 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121) down to i0 \u0018\n22m. NELGs and other galaxies are typically fainter, but\nwe expect to identify large fractions of them within the\nAXIS resources. We can conclude from this pilot study\nthat >90% of the medium sample can be identi\fed with\nthe AXIS programme.\nOne remarkable feature of this survey is that we have\nfound no clusters of galaxies as counterparts of the iden-\nti\fed X-ray sources.

Symbols as\nin 3.\nROSAT Deep Cluster Survey (Rosati et al. 1998) we\nwould have expected <2\u22123 clusters in our sample. We\nmust further stress that there are no cluster candidates\nin the unidenti\fed sources, down to the sensitivity limits\nof the optical images. Actually, the sliding box algorithm\nused to search for sources in the XMM-Newton images\nis not optimized for the detection of extended sources.\nTherefore we do not expect to be complete in groups and\nclusters. In fact, extended sources in XMM-Newton im-\nages are the subject of on-going parallel studies within\nthe XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre activities.\nWe have cross-correlated the X-ray source positions\nwith the NVSS radio survey (Condon et al. 1998). No\ncoincidences closer than 10 arcsec are found for the flux-\nlimited sample. The only radio source within 30 arcsec of\nan X-ray source is a faint source of 2.4 mJy, just below the\ncompleteness level of NVSS, 14.4 arcsec away from XMMU\nJ010400.9-064949. The NVSS positional uncertainty for a\nsource this faint (rms about 7 arcsec), when combined with\nthe astrometric accuracy of our X-ray sources (Sect. 5.1)\nmake it unlikely that this is a true association. For the\nfull sample of 89 sources found by our source-searching\nalgorithms, the number of coincidences within 30 arcsec\nincreases from zero to one, with a source of 2.7 mJy be-\ning found 7.1 arcsec from an unidenti\fed X-ray source of\n5:6\u000210\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Despite the fact that this is likely\nto be a true association, preliminary statistics based on\nabout 3000 X-ray sources from the ChaMP survey (Wilkes\net al. 2001; Wilkes & Green 2001, private communication)\n\fnd a radio association with NVSS which increases with\nX-ray flux, and with which our two XMM-Newton \felds\ndisagree at the 95% con\fdence level. Work is underway\nto investigate the radio properties of larger samples of\nsources.\n5.3.

Luminosity-redshift relation for the extragalactic\nsources identi\fed in the sample. Symbols as in 3.\nexception of NGC 4291, which has a luminosity not far\nfrom that of a normal galaxy (\u00183 \u0002 1040 erg s\u22121), all the\nremaining extragalactic objects have luminosities higher\nthan \u00181042:5 erg s\u22121, so there is no doubt they host an\nActive Galactic Nucleus. In particular, all the objects clas-\nsi\fed as NELGs, should in reality be called Narrow-line\nAGNs (NLAGNs). Indeed some (if not all of them) exhibit\n[OIII] lines much stronger than [OII] and\/or [NeV] emis-\nsion lines, all of which are features of a hard non-stellar\nionizing continuum in the narrow-line emitting region.\nThe weighted average hardness ratios for BLAGN are\nhHR1i = \u22120:68 \u0006 0:01 and hHR2i = \u22120:31 \u0006 0:04. It is\ninteresting to note that for a single power-law spectrum,\nthese values correspond to \u0393 \u0018 2 and \u0393 \u0018 1:6 respectively,\ni.e., it appears that BLAGN have a hardening in their\nspectrum towards high photon energies.\nIt is remarkable, however, that the average spectra\nof BLAGN do not appear to be consistent with a sin-\ngle power law spectrum. Indeed, while HR1 is consistent\nwith an unabsorbed \u0393 = 2 spectrum, at harder photon en-\nergies HR2 calls for a much flatter X-ray spectrum, with\n\u0393 \u0018 1:6. A similar result has been recently found by Pappa\net al. (2001) by co-adding ROSAT and ASCA spectra\nof 21 BLAGN. Our result con\frms that this is not due\nto a mismatch between ROSAT and ASCA calibrations\nand amphasizes the power of XMM-Newton in broad-band\nX-ray spectral studies.\nThe spectral shape that we infer for BLAGN was \frst\nempirically proposed by Schwartz & Tucker (1988) in\norder to reproduce the XRB spectrum. The subsequent\ndiscovery of a Compton reflection bump in the X-ray\nspectrum of Seyfert 1 galaxies (Pounds et al. 1990) sug-\ngested that reflection-dominated AGN (i.e., AGN where\n>90% of the observed X-rays would have been reflected\nin cold\/warm material) could contribute the bulk of the\nX-ray background (Fabian et al. 1990). Although no sig-\nni\fcant population of such sources has been detected, it\nis likely that we are witnessing the e\u000bects of Compton\nreflection or a similar phenomenon in the average X-ray\nFig. 11. Hardness ratios HR1 and HR2 as a function of red-\nshift z. Symbols as in 3. We also plot expected values for single\npower law spectra with \u0393 = 1:4 and \u0393 = 2.\nspectra of the z \u0018 1\u22122 BLAGN in our sample. If the\nCompton reflection bump entering the 4.5{10 keV band\nis the ultimate reason for the hard values of HR2, then\na trend with redshift should be seen. In Fig. 11 we plot\nboth hardness ratios HR1 and HR2 as a function of red-\nshift for the extragalactic objects. No trend is found in\nHR1 vs. z for BLAGN, and at best we can only claim\na hint of HR2 becoming higher at high redshifts. That,\nwhich would be expected if Compton reflection is respon-\nsible for the hardening of the spectrum, needs much more\ndata to be con\frmed.\nWe only \fnd marginal evidence for the NLAGN having\na harder spectrum than BLAGN (see Fig. 3). Such a trend\nhad been found in ROSAT surveys (Romero-Colmenero\net al. 1996; Almaini et al. 1996). The weighted average\nhardness ratios for these objects are hHR1i = \u22120:48\u00060:11\nand hHR2i = \u22120:37\u0006 0:04. hHR2i agrees with the corre-\nsponding value for BLAGNs, but HR1 is slightly higher,\nalthough only at \u00182\u001b signi\fcance. If we interpret the\nmarginal di\u000berence in terms of a \u0393 = 2 power-law spec-\ntrum being a\u000bected by intrinsic absorption in NLAGN,\nthe inferred column density is NHI = 5 \u0002 1022 cm\u22122 at a\nredshift of z = 0:4 where most of the NLAGNs are located.\nWe must recall that evidence has been accumu-\nlated that X-ray photoelectric absorption and optical\n534 X. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey\nspectroscopic classi\fcation do not appear to have a one-\nto-one relation. For example hard X-ray sources found\nin ROSAT surveys contain large fractions of unobscured\ntype 1 QSOs and Seyferts (Page et al. 2001). On the con-\ntrary, dusty warm absorbers produce little e\u000bect in the\nX-ray broad-band colours of AGN, but substantially influ-\nence their optical appearence. The underlying reason for\nall these apparent inconsistencies could be the di\u000berent\ndistributions of atomic gas and dust in the close environ-\nment of the AGN central engine (Maiolino et al. 2001),\nperhaps due to dust sublimation near the center (Granato\net al. 1997).\nSource XMMU J122017.9+752212 (NGC 4291) de-\nserves further comment. X-ray emission from this galaxy\nwas detected with Einstein (Canizares et al. 1987).\nRoberts & Warwick (2000) analyzed ROSAT HRI images\nof nearby galaxies and \fnd a nuclear X-ray point source\nwithin 6.8 arcsec from the centre of NGC 4291. The ex-\ntended X-ray emission of this source in the 0.5{4.5 keV\nXMM-Newton image clearly masks out a part of the sky,\nwhich is why we have removed a 1.5 arcmin radius circle\naround it. However, when this region is examined only in\nthe 2{10 keV band, the di\u000buse emission disappears. What\nis then seen is a point source approximately coincident\nwith the nucleus of NGC 4291 and a further 4 sources\nwithin the excised region, some of which might possibly\nbe associated with the galaxy. The fact that NGC 4291\npresents a point source in its center is a strong sugges-\ntion that an active nucleus might be actually hidden in\nthe centre of this optically dull galaxy. A more complete\ndiscussion of this interesting galaxy and its environment\nis beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented\nelsewhere.\n5.4. The Broad-Absorption Line QSOs\nAmong the sample of BLAGN we \fnd 2 (XMMU\nJ010328.7-064633 at z = 1:82 and XMMU J010316.7-\n065137 at z = 1:91) Broad-Absorption-Line (BAL) QSO\n(see Figs. 12 and 13). Parameters of the corresponding\nbroad-absorption line systems (based on the CIV line)\nare listed in Table 8. In particular we have computed the\nso-called Balnicity index introduced by Weymann et al.\n(1991) as a way to provide a continuous classi\fcation be-\ntween BAL and non-BAL QSOs. In the context of the\nsample studied by Weymann et al. (1991) the value of the\nBalnicity Index is in the low end for XMMU J010316.7-\n065137 but close to average for XMMU J010328.7-064633.\nBAL QSOs have been practically absent from previous\nX-ray selected samples. There have been a few exceptions:\n1 BAL QSO in the Einstein Medium Sensitivity Survey\nat z = 2:027 (Stocke et al. 1991) and more recently the\nELAIS\/BeppoSAX survey at z = 2:2 (Alexander et al.\n2001), the Chandra deep \feld south at z = 2:75, (Giacconi\net al. 2001) and the survey of ROSAT hard X-ray sources\nat z = 2:21 (Page et al. 2001).\nTable 8. Parameters of the broad absorption systems found in\nthe BAL QSOs, based on the CIV line: Wrest is the rest-frame\nequivalent width of the broad-absorption line, vej its ejection\nvelocity from the QSO and BI is the Balnicity index de\fned in\nWeymann et al. (1991).\nSource Wrest vej BI\n(\u0017A) (km s\u22121) (km s\u22121)\nXMMU J010316.7-065137 5 19 000 580\nXMMU J010328.7-064633 34 34 000 3650\nFig. 12. Optical spectra of the BAL QSO XMMU J010328.7-\n064633 obtained with the ISIS spectrograph on the WHT. Both\nblue and red arm spectra (which have di\u000berent channel size)\nare shown.\nFig. 13. Optical spectra of the BAL QSO XMMU J010316.7-\n065137 obtained with the ISIS double spectrograph on the\nWHT. Both blue and red arm spectra (which have di\u000berent\nchannel size) are shown.\nThe paucity of BAL QSOs in previous X-ray surveys is\nhardly surprising, as the gas ejected by BAL QSOs which\nis responsible for the broad absorption lines will e\u000eciently\nabsorb soft X-rays. Previous X-ray missions, mostly sen-\nsitive to soft X-rays like Einstein and ROSAT , are ex-\npected to have a much reduced sensitivity to BAL QSOs\nX. Barcons et al.: AXIS medium survey 535\nwith respect to optical surveys. It is illustrative to notice\nthat the only ROSAT -discovered BAL QSO was found in\na selection of hard X-ray spectrum sources.\nWe \fnd it intriguing that the BAL QSOs have \\nor-\nmal\" values of HR1: \u22120:79\u0006 0:08 for XMMU J010328.7-\n064633 and\u22120:62\u00060:17 for XMMU J010316.7-065137 (the\naverage over all sources in the sample is \u0018\u22120:69\u00060:01 for\nHR1). Indeed, the high redshift of the two objects helps\nto move the intrinsic photoelectric absorption feature be-\nlow our detection band (0.5{4.5 keV). Assuming z = 1:85,\nand an unabsorbed \u0393 = 2 power-law spectrum, an intrin-\nsic absorbing column of \u00181022 cm\u22122 increases the value\nof HR1 from \u22120:68 in the absence of intrinsic absorption\nto \u22120:61. It is then clear that these objects cannot have\nintrinsic columns signi\fcantly in excess of 1022 cm\u22122 or\notherwise we would see it in their X-ray spectra. However,\nthese are unusually small values for the absorbing columns\nin BAL QSOs. Gallagher et al. (2001) report on ASCA\nand Chandra observations of several BAL QSOs, and the\ninferred absorbing columns always exceed 1022 cm\u22122 and\nsometimes by a large amount. Here we see that low (neu-\ntral) column density BAL QSOs do exist. Perhaps high\nionisation and\/or partial covering could bring to agree-\nment the apparent small X-ray absorbing column with a\nsizeable CIV broad absorption line.\nA further remarkable fact is that both BAL QSOs lie\nat the redshift where the distribution of BLAGN peaks.\nThis might be telling us that we are only seeing the tip of\nthe iceberg, i.e., we have only detected BAL QSOs at the\nredshift where this detection would be more likely (helped\nindeed by the K-correction discussed above).\nWhat remains to be understood is why BAL QSOs\nwere practically absent in ROSAT surveys of similar\ndepth (e.g. Boyle et al. 1994). The sensitivity to higher\nX-ray photons of our current survey (0.5{4.5 keV) with\nrespect to the standard 0.5{2 keV ROSAT band does not\nmake a big di\u000berence: for a z = 1:85, intrinsically absorbed\n(1022 cm\u22122) power-law (\u0393 = 2) QSO spectrum, only\u001820%\nof the counts from the source fall in the 2{4.5 keV band\nin EPIC pn. A source with that spectrum at our sur-\nvey limit, would have a 0.5{2 keV flux slightly above\n\u00181 \u0002 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and would have been therefore\ndetectable in the so-called ROSAT deep survey (Boyle\net al. 1994).\n6. Conclusions\nAs expected, the majority (25 out of 29 or 86%) of the\nX-ray sources identi\fed in this sample are AGN. These are\ndivided into 25% Narrow-line AGN and 75% Broad-Line\nAGN. Narrow-line AGNs have some hints of photoelectric\nabsorption with respect to the BLAGN population, but\nthe e\u000bect is less than \u00182\u001b signi\fcant in our small sample.\nInferred columns for narrow-line AGNs at z \u0018 0:4 would\nbe around \u00185\u0002 1022 cm\u22122.\nPerhaps the most remarkable \fnding is that 2 out of\n24 AGN are BAL QSOs, i.e., \u001810%. This is similar to\nthe fraction of BAL QSOs in optically selected samples.\nThe X-ray spectrum of these BAL QSOs does not show\nevidence for photoelectric absorption, and the limits we\nderive for the intrinsic absorption column (<1022 cm\u22122)\ntell us that these are unusual objects among the BAL\nQSO population in their X-ray spectra.\nThe AXIS high-galactic latitude medium survey is\nnow progressing with \u0018250 X-ray sources spectroscopi-\ncally identi\fed. Large numbers of sources are needed, not\nonly to study in detail the overall properties of the domi-\nnant source population (AGN in this case), but also to \fnd\nand characterize the rarer populations, e.g., BAL QSOs or\noptically dull galaxies (Mushotzky et al. 2000; Baldi et al.\n2001).\nAcknowledgements.
