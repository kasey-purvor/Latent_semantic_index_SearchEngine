Currently, the tiles are applied to surfaces using either tile grouts or adhesive, with tile grout \n(typically epoxy based) or silicon resin being used to fill the void between adjoining tiles. A major \ndifficulty with tiled surfaces is that contaminants can enter into, and exit a space via a tiled surface, \nthrough the tile grouts used to fill the void between adjoining tiles, or in the case of silicon resin \nsealants, pass around the edges of the seal because the sealant is not fully adhered to the tile surface \ndue the presence of small voids that increase in size over time along the sealant\/tile interface [1]. The \nproblem is compounded, due to the tile grouts porosity, by water, germs and other harmful agents, \nwhich have the ability to permeate into cavities behind the tiles, corroding the bonding agent used to \nfix the tile to the substrate, the substrate itself or even the ceramic tile. Moreover, the predominant \nproblem with commercially available tile grouts is that because they are very difficult to clean, over \ntime they become contaminated, and have to be removed physically or mechanically; an arduous and \ncostly undertaking.  \nThis paper investigates the feasibility and characteristics of using of high power diode laser (HPDL) \nbeams to produce a tough, inexpensive seal in the void between adjoining vitrified ceramic tiles using \na newly developed amalgamated ceramic and oxide compound grout, as well as an amorphous, crack-\nfree surface glaze on the amalgamated compound seal using an enamel powder. Thus the tiles are \nsealed together, preventing any further contamination activity; in effect creating a completely sealed \nsurface that is both impermeable and relatively simple to clean and maintain since contaminants are \nbasically arrested on the tile and glazed seal surface. Because such a seal would be an integral a part \nof the surface as the tiles themselves, the necessity to remove old or contaminated grout from the void \nbetween the tiles would be eradicated (a 2.5-25 fold increase in wear life over conventional epoxy tile \ngrout has been demonstrated and is described in Part II of this paper). Clearly, the economic and \nmaterial benefits to be gained from the development of a more effective and efficient tile grout could \nbe significant. At present there is no reported work concerning the sealing of tile grout using laser \nbeams. \nIn previous studies the sealing of engineering ceramic surfaces using lasers has been demonstrated. \nThe remelting of Zr02 based protective ceramic layers using a CO2 laser [2] with power densities \n  4 \nranging from 8.5-17 kW\/cm2 was shown to markedly decrease the level of structural defects and the \nlamellar microstructure. The remelting of Zr02 based protective ceramic layers plasma sprayed onto a \nvariety of bond coats using cw and pulsed CO2 lasers [3] revealed that a pulsed laser produced less \ncracks, whilst the use of external flowing gas, such as He or Ar, resulted in increased cracking. \nHowever, the laser treated surfaces in both studies displayed the phenomenon of delayed fracture due \nto unrelieved thermal stresses. The laser melting of plasma sprayed ceramic coatings based on Al2O3, \nTiO2 and Zr02 by cw and pulsed CO2 lasers [4] revealed that the extent of cracking was a function of \nthe total energy input to the surface and the thermophysical properties of the ceramic coatings. \nConsequently it was concluded that, to avoid cracking in such materials when remelting using the \nCO2 laser it was essential to pre-heat the workpieces to around 800\n0C and thus reduce the thermal \ngradient [4]. \nThe firing of vitreous enamel frits onto steel substrates using CW CO2 laser irradiation has proved \nsuccessful [5, 6]. The fired enamels were found to be well bonded to the substrate and displayed                     \nan undulating surface morphology with minor porosities and a uniform microstructure. In both \nstudies, however, pre-heating in a furnace of the steel substrate to 2000C was necessary in order to \navoid microcracking. The firing of vitreous enamel frits onto glass substrates using CO2 lasers has \nalso been studied. Using a 4 kW-cw laser, conventional enamel frits containing PbO (to reduce the \nfiring temperature) were fired onto flat glass sheets [7] and the resultant temperature development \nwas analysed. Because of the localised heating nature of laser radiation, temperatures in excess of \n10000C could be achieved without causing any deformation of the substrate glass. As such, it proved \npossible to fire PbO-free enamel frits [8]. Furthermore, the gloss and the smoothness of the laser fired \nenamel were comparable to those of conventional furnace fired enamels. However, in both studies, \npre- and post-heating of the enamels in a furnace to temperatures in the range of the enamel melting \ntemperature was necessary in order to relieve thermal stresses.  \nResearch was conducted by the authors to determine the possibility of producing a laser induced \nimpervious surface glaze on a variety of vitrifiable substances placed in the void between adjoining \nvitrified ceramic tiles, thus sealing and joining together the tiles permanently. In this paper we report \na new technique of producing diode laser sealed surfaces without the need of pre-heating or special \natmospheric conditions. This procedure has been applied to the sealing of ceramic tile grout. The \nadvantages of using a HPDL are numerous, namely its portability, relatively simple beam delivery \nand high energy efficiency. Additionally, the lasers potential for large economies of scale means that \n  5 \nin time, low cost laser power can be realised, thus making many HPDL application possibilities \neconomically viable. \nGROUT MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT \nCommercially available epoxy tile grout is formulated from four main components; acrylic emulsion, \nlimestone, dolomite and a cellulose substance. The limestone and dolomite act as fillers and the \ncellulose substance is added basically to thicken the grout. It is well established that glazing can only \nbe achieved using materials containing at least some of the essential glass network forming \ncompounds such as SiO2 and BO3, along with some glass network modifying and intermediate \ncompounds such as Na2O, Al2O and MgO [9]. As such, it proved impossible to directly glaze epoxy \ntile grouts. Also, the coating of epoxy tile grout with a vitrifiable substance was not possible since the \nactual bonding mechanism by which the grout adheres to surfaces to which it is applied is \nmechanical, or more precisely hydraulic, and is achieved as a result of the acrylic emulsion \nhydraulically bonding to the surface [10]. Since the grout does not bond to surfaces chemically, it is \nunable to withstand elevated temperatures. Indeed, at temperatures above 2000C the grout will \nactually debond from the surface it is applied to [11]; a temperature well below the softening point of \ncommercial vitreous coating materials. \nInitial experiments conducted by the authors using such materials (vitrified ceramic tile powder and \npyrex glass powder) resulted in reasonable quality seals being produced. However, surface \nmicrocracks and porosities were ever-present features of the glazes, and as such, rendered them \nunsuitable for sealing purposes. Similarities in the results of this work are reflected by those of Shaw \n[12] and Fabes [13] who used laser radiation to densify sol-gel silica glass. Despite the fact that the \nlaser densification of the sol-gel was successful, in terms of the speed of the process and the levels of \ndensification achieved, surface blistering and microcracking always resulted. This is perhaps to be \nexpected, since under normal glass manufacturing conditions the glass is raised to its softening \ntemperature and held there for many hours, not just for the few seconds it takes for the laser to pass \nacross and irradiate the glass solution or the powders. It would appear from this work that, for such \nmaterials, the laser process was too rapid, particularly in terms of the resultant high cooling rates \nwhich are typically in the order of 102-104 0\/s [14], thus not permitting the glass network formers, \nSiO2 and B2O3, to fuse properly resulting in deep cracks and porosities [9]. Surface microcracking \nwas due, in part, to the solidified material over contracting as a result of the elevated melting \n  6 \ntemperatures caused by the relatively high SiO2 content of the materials [9]. However, the formation \nof microcracks was principally due to excessive thermal stresses resulting from the greatly reduced \nheating\/cooling cycle times which create a large thermal gradient between the melted region and the \ncooler surrounding material [15]. The resultant porosities were due to either the materials lack of \nfluidity when melted, preventing bubbles from escaping the surface properly [9], or the lack within \nthe materials composition of compounds such as Fe2O3 or FeS2 which are known to reduce the \namount of oxygen released during melting and resolidification [16]. \nBased on the results of these initial experiments, efforts were made to produce a glaze on the surface \nof unmixed, individual vitrifiable oxide materials. The results of these initial laser glazing \nexperiments gave a clear indication that better results would be more likely from using combinations \nof these vitrifiable compounds in suitable ratios with other substances, and indeed with each other, in \norder to optimise the beneficial properties, and reduce the detrimental properties of the constituent \nmaterials. Table 1 details the amalgamated oxide compound grout (AOCG) composition that was \nfound to give the optimum seal results and the characteristics that each compound imparts on the \nblend during laser irradiation. \nIn order to form a manageable paste the AOCG was mixed with approximately 50wt% water diluted \nsodium silicate solution. Sodium silicate solution, or waterglass as it is more commonly known, is a \nviscous colourless solution of colloidal sodium silicate. It is a silica containing aqueous solution that, \nwhen combined with other solutions such as the AOCG, forms a gel-like mass of silicate hydrate. \nSuch a mass remains soft and malleable until it is exposed to CO2 gas, either by means of a direct \nflow or through contact with the atmosphere, whereupon it hardens from the complete hydrolysis of \nthe dissolved sodium silicate by the reaction [17] \n   Na2SiO3 + CO2 \u2192 Na2CO3 + SiO2 (colloidal) (1) \nNotwithstanding this, exposure of the hardened mass to water results in a reversing of the process and \nthe mass returns to a gel-like state. However, heating of the hardened mass in effect fires the \nwaterglass (similar to that of a ceramic material) [17], increasing its strength and enabling it to \nwithstand water exposure. Nevertheless, despite the fact that good quality seals could be produced \nusing the AOCG, a microscopic examination of the laser treated AOCG surface revealed the structure \nto be polycrystalline. Thus, such a seal would be unable to function correctly, still allowing water, \ngerms or other harmful agents to permeate through its surface [15]. \n  7 \nThe thermal characteristics of the AOCG in terms of the compressive strength with increased \ntemperature were investigated and are shown in Figure 1. The strength of the AOCG in terms of \nincreasing temperature is determined primarily by the waterglass, since the strength of the individual \noxide compounds varies little or not at all at relatively low temperatures (<5000C) [18]. As one can \nsee, as the temperature is increased up to 1500C the compressive strength of the AOCG increases to \nmaximum of 12.4 MPa. This is due to the extensive dehydration of the silica gel between 1000C and \n1500C, resulting in a gel mass which is water-free and therefore stronger [19]. However, once the \ntemperature exceeds 1500C the compressive strength of the AOCG decreases to 3.9 MPa from where \nit decreases uniformly to a minimum of 3.7 MPa at 6000C. The interim maximum in compressive \nstrength observed at around at 7000C can be attributed to the crystallisation phenomena of the \nNa2O.2SiO2 within the waterglass [19]. The maximum compressive strength of 12.4 MPa for the \nAOCG compares similarly with 10.5 MPa for the conventionally available waterproof ready mixed \ncoloured tile grout. However, the general thermal resistance properties of the AOCG were found to \nbe far superior to those of the waterproof ready mixed coloured tile grout. Even at a temperature of \n8000C no breakdown of the AOCG was observed, whilst it is known that waterproof ready mixed \ncoloured tile grout loses its integrity at temperatures above 2000C [10]. Also, at temperatures above \napproximately 1000C the complete irreversibility of the water glass reaction, that is, the rehydration \nof the water glass when exposed to water, was achieved. \nAs was shown earlier, without any exposure to heat the AOCG will harden simply through              \ncontact with the atmosphere according to Equation (1). However, the fact that the AOCG in this state \nis hydraulically bonded, as opposed to chemically bonded, combined with the retention of chemical \nand mechanical water (that is water that is bonded into the materials matrix and water that is added \nrespectively) means that the hardened mass will rehydrate when exposed to water [17, 19]. Heating of \nthe AOCG in this state is similar in effect to the firing of ceramic, in that the heating causes gradual \nceramic \u2018sintering\u2019 of the materials; dehydrating the mechanical water, dehydroxylating the chemical \nwater and generally bonding together and stabilising the substances, until at around 1000C sufficient \npyrochemical changes have occurred to prevent any rehydration of the AOCG [17, 20]. \nTo overcome the inherent problems of a polycrystalline seal, an amorphous surface layer on top of \nthe AOCG was produced by applying an enamel glaze to the seal surface. This was achieved by \napplying a 250\u00b5m layer of the enamel frit onto the laser treated AOCG surface. The composition of \nthe enamel consisted mainly of SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn, F and small quantities of Ba, Al2O3 and Ni. \n  8 \nFurther experiments showed (see Results and Discussion) that because of the wettability \ncharacteristics of the AOCG, it was necessary to laser treat the compound surface prior to the \napplication of the enamel. Thus the sealing process is achieved in two-stages, and consequently the \nseal itself consists of two distinct components, an AOCG substrate and a glazed enamel surface; the \naim being that the AOCG seal provides a tough bulk substrate which simply acts a filler for the void \nbetween adjoining tiles whilst the enamel provides an impervious surface glaze. \nLASER PROCESSING EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE \nThe experiments were carried out using UK standard 150 x 150 x 5mm vitrified ceramic tiles of \nvarious colours; white, navy blue, leaf green and jet black, cut into smaller pieces, 20 x 20mm, for \nexperimental purposes and applied in pairs to an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) substrate using \nstandard epoxy tile grout (Vallance Ltd., Leeds, UK). The spacing between the vitrified edges of each \ntile pair was the industry recommended 1.5mm. The fixed ceramic tile pieces were then allowed to \nset for the standard setting time of one day. The tiles were then sealed by means of a two stage \nprocess. A compound of mixed vitrifiable oxide powders such as SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, ZrO2 and \nZnO, etc. was produced. The oxide powders were sieved to ensure a particle size of less than 75\u00b5m, \nthen thoroughly mixed together to ensure homogeneity, along with approximately 50wt% water \ndiluted sodium silicate solution so as to form a manageable paste. The amalgamated oxide compound \ngrout was then placed into the void, flush to the surface of the tiles and allowed to cure for two days. \nThe set compound was then irradiated using the HPDL and overlaid directly with a thin layer \n(250\u00b5m) of enamel frit which, in order to form a manageable paste, was mixed with 20wt% white \nspirit. The composition of the enamel consisted mainly of the following; SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn, F \nand small quantities of Ba, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size was <75\u00b5m. The enamel frit paste \nwas allowed to cure for one to two hours and then irradiated immediately with the defocused HPDL \nbeam. \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810nm \u00b120nm and \noperating in the CW mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The laser beam was \ndelivered to the work area by means of a 4m long, 600\u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of \nwhich was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry \ntable. The grouts were irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam spot \n  9 \ndiameter of 1.75mm and laser powers (measured at the workpiece after fibre and optics losses using a \nPower Wizard power meter) of 10-45 W. Figure 2 illustrates the laser processing experimental \narrangement, where the defocused laser beam was fired along the vitrifiable substances placed in the \nvoid between adjoining vitrified ceramic tiles by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam using \nthe x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 1-20 mm\/s. In order to study the \npossible effects of different process gasses, 3 l\/min of coaxially blown Ar or O2 assist gas was used to \nshield the laser optics, whilst the fumes produced were removed with an extraction system  \nIn order to analyse the laser treated specimens, they were sectioned with a Struers cutting machine \nusing a diamond rimed cutting blade, and then polished using cloths and diamond suspension pastes. \nThe sectioned samples were then examined using optical microscopy, SEM, EDX, and XRD \ntechniques. \nRESULTS \nLaser Effects on the Amalgamated Oxide Compound Grout \nExposure of the AOCG to laser irradiation results in rapid heating of the surface, for most materials \ntypically 103-105 0C\/s [14], which leads to the further densification of the AOCG surface with the \nremoval of the pores between the starting particles of the compound, combined with growth together \nand strong bonding between adjacent particles [22]. A microscopic cross-sectional examination of the \nlaser treated AOCG showed clearly an upper densified layer, with a gradual decrease in the amount \nof densification as the depth increased. Also, an XRD analysis revealed that the structure of the laser \ntreated AOCG surface was of a polycrystalline nature, indicating that the densification is achieved by \nsolid-state material transport, driven by differences in free-energy or chemical potential, rather than \nby the formation of a liquid glass phase, as is the case with ceramic materials [22]. \nThe densification of the AOCG through interaction with the HPDL beam also results in a colour \nchange; changing from beige to black. These changes are due to the resultant phase transitions and \nalso, the presence in small concentrations of metal transition ions in various oxidation states within \nthe AOCG composition, in particular, ferric ions in Fe3+ and Fe2+ oxidation state. Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions \nare known to give rise to green and blue colours respectively when subjected to intense heating [23]. \nHowever, if both phases are present within the composition, then the colour is determined by the \nFe3+\/Fe2+ ion ratio, resulting in dark blue or black colours [23]. \n  10 \nThe Effects of Different Shroud Gases on the Enamel Glaze \nFigure 4 shows the typical morphology of the enamel glaze produced with (a) O2 and (b) Ar shield \ngases. In both instances the surface is undulated and displays no porosities. However, the crack \ndensity in the Ar shield gas sample is higher that that of the O2 treated sample.  \nBecause of its open structure, it is possible for gases to dissolve molecularly in glass, and, if the gas \nmolecule is small enough, it can diffuse rapidly in a simple glass such as fused silica [9]. Indeed, \ngases such as H2 and O2 are known to dissolve molecularly in glass and can also react with the glass \nnetwork [9]. It was noted that the quality of the enamel glazes, in terms of smoothness, porosity and \nmicrocracks, of the vitreous glazes produced was significantly influenced by the type of shield gas \nemployed. The use of O2 as the shield gas significantly reduced the number of porosities and \nmicrocracks within the vitreous glaze as well as producing a much smoother surface, indicating that a \nconsiderable amount of O2 interacted with the glass network increasing the heat generation and \nsubsequently the fluidity of the melt. In contrast, the Ar did not interact with the glass network and \nwas consequently trapped within the more viscous melt in the form of bubbles. As such, when \nemploying O2 bubbles within the melt were much reduced and escaped from the melt more readily \ndue to its lower viscosity, thus reducing the number of porosities. \nMicrostructures and Heat Affected Zone Characteristics \nThe typical microstructure of the surface of the AOCG before and after laser irradiation is shown in \nFigure 4. From Figure 4(a) it can be seen clearly that before laser treatment the surface of the AOCG \nappears coarse, with individual crystals of the constituent components being clearly discernible. After \nlaser treatment (Figure 4(b)) the surface appears cellular-dendritic with the crystals being semi-\nordered, showing that fusion of the individual particulates has occurred. Such a solidification \nstructure is indicative of rapidly solidified microstructures [24]. Indeed, the XRD analysis of the \nAOCG surface before and after laser treatment revealed that after laser treatment the AOCG surface \nhad become more amorphous due to partial laser vitrification. On the whole, the phases present \nwithin the laser treated region were the same, however, their proportions were different. In particular, \nafter laser treatment it was not possible to detect any SiO2 whilst the Al2O3 was depleted. This is \nprobably due to the fact that these materials are glass forming elements and as such would have \nvitrified when laser irradiated. \n  11 \nThe microstructure of the bond regions between the enamel seal and the laser treated AOCG and the \nenamel seal and the vitreous surface of the ceramic tile are shown in Figure 5. As one can see from \nFigure 5(b), there is no dendritic growth in any of the three bond regions which is characteristic of \nenamels fired onto substrates containing Fe, Si and in particular, Co [25]. However, as Figure 5(b) \nshows, combined with an EDX analysis of the bond region between the enamel seal and the laser \ntreated AOCG, an interface region in which some of the base AOCG had dissolved into the enamel \nexists.  \nFigure 6 shows the heat affected zone (HAZ) produced in the AOCG as a result of the laser \ninteraction. The HAZ is typically around 150\u00b5m thick. Because the main component of AOCG is \nchamotte which contains a certain amount of CaCO3, on interaction with the laser beam the rapid \nlocalised surface heating results in the decomposition of the CaCO3 at temperatures between 825\n0C \nand 9500C in accordance with the recognised chemical reaction [26]. \n CaCO3 = CaO + CO2 - 42.52 kcal\/mole (2) \nAs one can see, the breakdown results in unslaked lime (CaO) and CO2 gas. The CO2 gas simply \nenters into the atmosphere, whilst the CaO either rests below the semi-amorphous irradiated zone \nproducing a mark. Indeed, by using a phenolphthalein indicator followed by water misting, it was \npossible to clearly discern the HAZ around the laser treated zone on the AOCG, since \nphenolphthalein is an indicator which is colourless in CaO, turning violet-red in the presence of \nCa(OH)2 due to the change in pH. \nDISCUSSION \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread to \ncover (wet) the solid surface [27]. The angle which the liquid subtends with the solid is known as the \ncontact angle. In practice, for wetting to occur the contact angle \u03b8<900. If \u03b8>900 then the liquid does \nnot wet the solid and no adhesion occurs [27]. From wetting experiments conducted (using the sessile \ndrop technique) with the molten enamel frit and the AOCG before and after laser irradiation, the \ncontact angle was measured  \nOnce irradiated by the HPDL beam the enamel powder melts, transforming to a liquid phase. As \nsuch, the process of the bonding of the enamel to the AOCG substrate is determined by the \n  12 \nwettability of the seal. The term wetting in its most general sense is used to denote the displacement \nof air from a liquid or solid surface by water or an aqueous solution [27]. When a drop of liquid is in \nfree space it is drawn into a spherical shape by the tensile forces of its surface tension. When such a \ndrop of liquid is brought into contact with a flat solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and \nthus whether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular \nforces that exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive) [27]. The \nindex of this effect is the contact angle \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. \u03b8 is related to the \nsolid and liquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and the solid-liquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the \nprincipal of virtual work expressed by the rearranged Young\u2019s equation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (3) \nThus, when \u03b8<900 wetting will occur, whilst when \u03b8>900 non-wetting will result. Clearly, to achieve \nwetting, \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a lower surface tension \nwill always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to reduce the total free-\nenergy of the system [28]. This is due to fact that the molecular adhesion between solid and liquid is \ngreater than the cohesion between the molecules of the liquid [27]. \nThe adhesion intensity of a liquid to a solid surface is known as the work of adhesion. Based on the \nnature of the attractive forces existing across the liquid-solid interface, wetting can be classified into \nthe two broad categories of physical wetting and chemical wetting. In physical wetting the attractive \nenergy required to wet a surface is provided by the reversible physical forces, such as the van der \nWaals and dispersion forces. In chemical wetting adhesion is achieved as a result of reactions \noccurring between the mating surfaces, giving rise to chemical bonds [29].  \nIn practice, complex combinations of the various bonding mechanisms actually occur, varying \naccording to the types of materials used [29]. For the AOCG and the enamel, the mechanisms \ninvolved in ceramic-glass bonding are reasonably applicable. These principally include physical \nbonding (van der Waals forces), chemical bonding (oxide transformation and O2 bridging) and on a \nvery small scale, electrochemical reactions such as the electrolytic effect due to the presence of ferric \noxides within the AOCG reacting with other oxides in the enamel [29]. However, in the case of the \nAOCG and the enamel, the bonding mechanism is chiefly due to physical forces, since adhesion \nbetween many materials is assured by electron transfer and is thus related to bandgap energy [30]. \n  13 \nThus, for non-conducting materials, such as the AOCG, with large bandgaps, there will be practically \nno free charges inside the ceramic crystals, even at elevated temperatures. In this case the electron \ntransfer at the interface will not take place since the electron transfer depends exclusively on the \nconcentration of free charges in the ceramic crystal [30]. As a result, the chemical contribution to the \nwork of adhesion is negligible [30]. Notwithstanding this, the bonding mechanism between the laser \ntreated AOCG and the enamel is not entirely due to physical forces. As Figure 7(a) shows, slight \nmicrostructural changes at the interface between the AOCG and the enamel have occurred. Indeed, \nenamel glazes on ceramic materials, such as the AOCG, typically are bonded as a result of some of \nthe base material dissolving into the glaze [29], with wetting characteristics often being achieved or \nenhanced by a reaction at the interface at an elevated temperature [27]. Furthermore, when the \nsamples were pulled apart in this region debris from both components was to be found on each of the \ntwo pieces, again indicating some form of chemical bond.  \nPrior to laser irradiation it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the surface of the AOCG. As has \nalready been seen, the contact angle was measured as 1180, and as such would prevent the enamel \nfrom wetting the AOCG surface. Indeed, laser interaction with the enamel when placed on the \nuntreated AOCG surface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel; the formation of small \nspheres approximately the diameter of the laser beam itself [31]. There are perhaps two possible \nreasons for the fact that laser treatment of the AOCG is essential in order that the enamel completely \nwets the surface of the AOCG. Firstly, HPDL irradiation of the surface resulted in the fusion of the \nindividual crystals (Figure 5(b)), altering the structure from polycrystalline to semi-amorphous, \ncreating a much more consolidated surface. It is well established that complete wetting of a surface \nwill only occur if the liquid surface energy is less than the solid surface energy [37, 38]. But, this \npartial vitrification may have given rise to an decrease in the surface tension of the AOCG, therefore \nallowing the enamel to adhere to the AOCG surface since low surface energy liquids, such as the \nmolten enamel, do not strongly adhere to high surface energy solids, such as the AOC. Secondly, \nwetting may have been influenced, to a lesser extent, by the increase in the number of oxides present \nin the AOCG surface as a result of the laser treatment, which is known to increase the likelihood of \nwetting [32]. Additionally, the presence of Fe3+ ions in the laser treated AOCG surface, as indicated \nby the colour change, may also have contributed to wetting, since it is known that Fe3+ ions \neffectively reduce the contact angle [33]. However, as Figure 6(a) shows, sound adhesion was \nensured as a result of the enamel penetrating into the irregularities in the laser treated AOCG surface.  \n  14 \nThe glazes produced with the enamel fired using the HPDL displayed no porosities and, depending \nupon the shield gas used, few to no microcracks. The major reason for the reduction, and even \neradication of microcracks is the reduction in the thermal gradient \u2206T, during laser irradiation. This is \ndue partly to the fact that the softening point of the enamel powder is around 5000C, much lower than \nmany of the other materials tested. Therefore, the tensile stresses that result from the unrelieved \nelastic stresses that occur due to the contraction of the material between the softening point (5000C) \nand ambient temperature (200C) are much reduced to a value below that of the fracture strength. The \nthermal stress \u03c3, induced by a thermal gradient can be calculated using the Kingery equation: \n  \u03c3\n\u03b1\n\u03c5\n=\n\u2212\nE T\u2206\n1\n  (4) \n  where,  E = Young\u2019s Modulus (N\/m2) \n                          \u2206T  = Thermal Gradient (K) \n   \u03b1 = Coefficient of thermal expansion (K-1) \n  \u03bd  = Poisson\u2019s ratio \n\u2206T is the difference between the critical temperature (below which stresses can no longer be relieved) \nand ambient temperature. For pyrex glass this is the difference between the softening point, 7800C \nand ambient temperature 200C. Since the softening point of pyrex glass is 7800C [9], that is pyrex \nglass can be plastically deformed at temperatures above 7800C, thermal stresses arising during \ncooling from above 7800C are relieved by plastic deformation. However, unrelieved elastic stresses \nresult due to contraction occurring between 7800C and ambient temperature 200C. Thus for pyrex \nglass \u2206T=7600C. So, by using the following values for pyrex glass; E=6.42 x 104 MN\/m2,                 \n\u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1, \u2206T=7600C and \u03bd=0.176, when the pyrex glass powder was irradiated by the laser \nbeam the thermal stress produced according to Equation (4) is 185 MN\/m2. Since this is in excess of \nthe fracture strength of pyrex glass, 120 MN\/m2 [9], cracking will occur, and can only be avoided by \nsevere distortion or through the reduction of \u2206T by pre-heating. For the enamel, however, the \nsoftening temperature is 5000C, therefore \u2206T is only 4800C. Also, E=6.25 x 104 MN\/m2,                        \n\u03b1=33 x 10-7 K-1 and \u03bd=0.162 [18]. Again, using Equation (5) the thermal stress induced in the enamel \nduring HPDL irradiation is calculated to be 118 MN\/m2, which is below the fracture strength of the \nenamel, 135 MN\/m2 [18]. As such, cracking will not occur, making any pre-heating completely \nunnecessary. \n  15 \nAlso, because the output beam from the HPDL is inherently non-Gaussian in nature, a temperature \nprofile that peaks in the centre of the irradiated region and tapers off to room temperature at the \ncircumference [4] is avoided. Thus, during cooling the contraction of any part is not opposed by the \nneighbouring elements, which are at different temperatures when a Gaussian beam is used. As such \nthe resultant high radial, tangential and axial stresses are greatly reduced. \nCONCLUSION \nVitrified ceramic tiles have been successfully sealed using a 60 W-cw high power diode laser \n(HPDL) with power densities as low as 500 W\/cm2 and at rates as high as 600 mm\/min. A two-stage \nprocess has been developed using a new grout material which consists of two distinct components: an \namalgamated compound substrate and a glazed enamel surface; the amalgamated compound seal \nprovides a tough bulk substrate which simply acts a filler for the void between adjoining tiles, whilst \nthe enamel provides an impervious surface. The temperature resistance of the AOCG proved to far \nsuperior to that of conventional tile grout, with complete integrity at 5000C, whilst the tile grout fails \nat temperatures in excess of 2000C. \nContact angle measurements revealed that because of the wettability characteristics of the \namalgamated oxide compound grout (AOCG), laser surface treatment was necessary in order to alter \nthe surface from a polycrystalline to a semi-amorphous structure, thus allowing the enamel to adhere. \nThe surface of the tiles proved to accommodate complete wetting with the enamel. Bonding of the \nenamel to the AOCG and the ceramic tiles was identified as being principally due to van der Waals \nforces (dispersion forces), and on a very small scale, slight microstructural changes occurring at the \ninterface between the AOCG and the enamel resulting in some of the base AOCG material dissolving \ninto the glaze. \nThe mechanical testing and an analysis of the corrosion properties of the AOCG with and without the \nenamel top seal, as well as the seal\u2019s life characteristics, are presented in Part II of this paper. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/K99770), the EPSRC: CDP Group (CASE Award No. 95562556) and BNFL for their \n  16 \nfinancial support.

The most essential element in glass forming. Increases \nthermal shock and acid resistance. \nAluminium Oxide Glass network intermediate element. Increases viscosity and improves stability \ntowards devitrification, as well as the glasses durability \nMagnesia Glass network modifier. Lowers softening temperature. Reduces number of \nnetwork bonds and therefore reduces viscosity. Has a beneficial stabilising effect. \nZinc Oxide Imparts fluidity (reduces the viscosity) and ease of melting without effecting \nthermal expansion. Also increases resistance to thermal shock.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
