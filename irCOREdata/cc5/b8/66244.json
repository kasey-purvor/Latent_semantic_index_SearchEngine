They form part of a court case brought by the parishioners of St\nOswald\u2019s church in Durham against Bishop Thomas Hatfield between 1360 and 1364.\nThe details of the whole case are irrelevant here; suffice to say that in the course of it\nthe parishioners appealed to Rome and had their case heard by papal judges-delegate\nin York, beginning late in 1360, with the witnesses recorded in February the next year.\nMiscellaneous Charter in the Durham Cathedral Muniments 5527a tells us that the\nwitnesses it listed were heard on 4\u20136 February 1360(1), 5527c and 2610 give 5 and 6\nFebruary for their lists;1 2611 says its list was heard on 14\u201316 February. Details about\ntravel came to be included because, when Hatfield was summoned to York, he or his\nlawyers contended that York was too far from the boundary of his diocese for him\nconveniently to come.2\nI have added as an appendix the names of the witnesses with, next to each, the\nMiscellaneous Charters of the Cathedral of Durham where the copies of their evi-\ndence are contained. In order to understand the depositions one needs to realize that\nHatfield\u2019s case was that he had been summoned \u2018to a place too far away considering\nthe person of the aforesaid reverend father, the difficulties of the journey and the\ntime of year, which was much more than a day\u2019s journey\u2019 [ad locum nimis remotum\nconsiderate persona reverendi patris, viarum discrimina et temporis qualitate, longa ultra\nunam dietam].3\nAfter Martinmas, he claimed, the roads were far too muddy. One of his points\nwas that York was further from the Tees than Canterbury is from Rochester \u2018which\nis commonly considered in England to be an ordinary day\u2019s journey\u2019 [que quidem\n1 D(urham) C(athedral) M(uniments), Misc Ch 5527c, fols 9v, 10v.\n2 The points pleaded in this part of Hatfield\u2019s case are in DCM, Loc XXVII 26(20).\n3 DCM, Loc XXVII 26 (18).\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) U\nniv\ners\nity\n of\n Le\ned\ns\n120 TRAVEL FROM DURHAM TO YORK\ndistancia communiter reputatur in Anglia una dieta vulgaris].4 Thus, according to his\nlawyers, the summons breached canon law. William Lyndwood, the almost contem-\nporary English canonist, said that someone cited to appear must be given enough time\nand that what counted as enough must depend on the type of case, the distance, and\nthe quality of the people concerned.5 A day, he said, was to be considered a natural\nday and would vary according to the area.6 Thus the case of Hatfield came to discuss\nwhether the Bishop could or could not reach York in one day from the boundaries of\nhis diocese of Durham.\nThe Durham archives have preserved the depositions of forty-four witnesses for\nboth sides of the case, some remarkably detailed. Many gave their age and status\nand some explained where they were living now. All gave reasons for their answers.\nThe questions they were asked included in all cases what they considered to be the\nshortest way from the boundaries of the diocese to York, how long that distance\nwas and what the route was. They were also asked what they considered to be a day\u2019s\njourney, and some of them replied with opinions about whether the Bishop could do\nit in winter. The witnesses ranged from Master Hugo de Fletham to William Porter\nfrom Durham, a fishmonger, persons of very different experience and social status.\nTherefore their estimates of the length of journey possible and of the ways that it\ncould be done varied greatly.\nThe question of what was considered a day\u2019s journey produced the most dissimilar-\nity, revealing striking differences between persons with different occupations. Only\nMaster Hugo de Fletham, who was a clerk and notary, showed clear consciousness\nof the difference between a day for legal purposes and an ordinary one. He put it\nthat there was one sort of day ordinarily used and another which was legal, written\nin the law. [quod una (dieta) est vulgaris et alia legalis que scribitur in iure] The day,\nnot surprisingly, was measured for most of the witnesses from sunrise to sunset. They\nexpressed this in different ways. William de Sockburn, a householder living in\nBishopton \u2018cultivating land but formerly a cloth merchant travelling through the\narea\u2019 [moram trahens in Bishopton paterfamilias, colens terras nunc et aliquando fuit\nmercator panni communiter laborans per patriam], said robustly that noble persons\n\u2018may rise with the sun and go to bed before it sets if they wish\u2019 [surgant cum sole et\ncubent ante occasum si velint]. Others had other ways of measuring the day\u2019s length.\nRichard de Croxdale, living in Durham, said that the day began \u2018with daylight fit\nfor counting money\u2019 [cum luce diei apto ad numerandum pecuniam] and ended with\nthe light.\nMeasurements by daylight meant that winter and summer days were of very differ-\nent lengths and witnesses would say that they were describing \u2018these parts\u2019, with their\nshort winter day and very long day in summer. Dominus Walter Jakes, a mass priest\nfrom Durham City, and Dominus Thomas Cupper, another priest from Durham,\nboth described travelling to York from Darlington about 2 February, probably in fact\nto give this evidence. They went via Neasham, which they reached \u2018at full day\u2019 or \u2018at\n4 DCM, Loc XXVII 26 (20).\n5 W.

They must therefore have started in the semi-dark. John Travers of Meles\n(Meaux?) talked of starting two or three miles before day. This usage merely confirms\nthat most witnesses realized that a winter day was much shorter than a summer one\nand measured the day by the distance they reckoned to be able to travel. For most\nof the witnesses for the citizens, however, about thirty miles in a day in winter on\nhorseback and between thirty-six and forty in summer was what a man could do. So\nsaid, for example Dominus Robert Aresom or Sireson, a chaplain and mass-priest\nfrom Wearmouth. It was in their interest, of course, to lengthen the day. Some\nclaimed remarkably long days even in winter. Alexander de Belingham claimed\nto have gone with Hatfield into Scotland the last time the King was in Scotland\n(therefore in 1356)7 and they travelled with all the Bishop\u2019s train in one day in winter\nfrom the little town (villeta) called Bankyll (?Bankshill in Dumfrieshire) to Bolton\nin [East] Lothian (Louzian) on about 2 February, a distance much more than thirty\nmiles. He claimed to have travelled sixty miles on horseback in one day [ipsemet\niuratus transivit ut dicit per lx miliaria uno die cum equo suo]. Roger of Dunnington,\nwho lived at Angrum two miles from Sockburn and was a servant of Robert de Herle,\nknight (whom we will meet again), declared that in summer he often walked from\nDarlington to York. He often came from Sockburn to York, beginning his day at\nSockburn, having first set his lord\u2019s servants to the plough and still arrived at York in\ndaylight [incepit diem suam apud Sockburne positis primo per servientes domini bobuis\net iumentis ad arandum et venit ad Ebor\u2019 per lucem diei illius]. Clearly these last were\ntough, vigorous men. Not all were like this, evidently. Robert de Sireson, for instance,\nsaid that \u2018in summer he began his day immediately after sunrise and ended it\nlong before sunset, that is about midday, although he usually travelled very gently\u2019\n[tempore estivo post ortum solis statim incipiet dietam huismodi et finiet diu ante\noccasum solis videlicet circa meridiem licet communiter et valde delicate laboraret].\nThere were, of course, many reasons why a day\u2019s journey might be shorter.\nWitnesses recognized that much depended on the quality of the horse. So John de\nDunwell, who lived in York, had come over a river crossing in summer \u2018with small\nhorses\u2019 [cum parvis equis]. William de Munketon reckoned that in summer \u2018sometimes\npeople riding stronger horses\u2019 could do between forty-eight and fifty miles in one\nday [aliquando in forcioribus equitantibus]. Thomas Cupper said that he had done\nDarlington to York in one day in summer and others with him, \u2018with weak horses\u2019\n[cum equis debilibus]. Richard of Croxdale had done the journey with one small horse\nand considered that episcopal horses would be stronger than his.\nClearly much depended also on the fitness of the rider. It is of interest to see that\nas an alternative to itinero for \u2018travel\u2019 our text uses laboro, an accepted usage which\nseems to imply journey on business, though I have translated it \u2018travel\u2019 in most\ncontexts. Galfridus de Thornton, a servant in York, claimed to have walked following\nhis master\u2019s horse from Darlington to York even on the shortest day and was sure\nthat this was a day\u2019s journey \u2018for anyone who is strong and able to travel\u2019 [pro\nquocumque potente et valente laborare]. He claimed to have done the journey from\n7 See DNB article on Hatfield.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) U\nniv\ners\nity\n of\n Le\ned\ns\n122 TRAVEL FROM DURHAM TO YORK\nNeasham (on the banks of the Tees in Durham diocese) in the company of nuns,\npresumably from the convent there, who could be supposed to be weaker creatures.\nDominus Richard Talbot, a chaplain to Master William Farnham, said that he knew\nthat Hatfield was able to make a journey longer than that from Darlington or\nNeasham to York in winter, asserting that \u2018the bishop is quite young and fit to travel\nand this witness has seen him, so he says, riding steadily and fast\u2019 [et est idem\nepiscopus satis juvenis et robustus ad laborandum quem vidit iste testis ut dicit firmiter et\nvelociter equitare].\nSome of the witnesses, however, recognized that bishops were not just ordinary\ntravellers. Clearly a bishop might be expected to wish to hear mass on the day of\ntravel. Witnesses were asked about fitting mass into their day and a very few said they\ndid so. Thomas Bower, a forester from Weardale, said that \u2018some of the merchants\nwith whom he had travelled (from Darlington to York) sometimes heard mass on the\njourney\u2019 [quosdam ipsorum sic itinerantium aliquando vidit audire missas suas in medio\nitinere]. Dominus Richard Talbot, as befitted a chaplain, had often heard mass on\nthe journey from Neasham to York. William de Munketon said that, coming from\nYork, merchants heard mass on the Ouse Bridge, no doubt at the chantry chapel of St\nWilliam.8 But far more said that mass did not come into their day; their testimony can\nbe summed up by that of John de Coucy, a butcher of York, who said bluntly \u2018men\nwho travel rarely hear mass . . . especially such as he saw doing these day\u2019s journeys,\nthat is common men such as merchants with their packs and bundles\u2019 [homines\nqui communiter itinerant per raro audiviunt missas suas . . . precipue tales quales ipse\nvidit facere dictas dietas, videlicet vulgares homines sicut sunt mercatores cum packis\net fardellis suis].\nFurthermore, of course, the Bishop was a great man and would travel \u2018with his\nhousehold, bringing equipment for divine service and with sumpter horses, hand-carts\nand wheeled carts\u2019 [ducere secum totam familiam suam, caragium cum carrectis . . .\net cum falleris et capella]. The vicar of St Mary\u2019s church, Bishophill Junior, in York,\nWalter of Middleham, regarded this as \u2018fitting\u2019 [ut decet].9 This clearly made a great\ndifference to speed, so that Robert Sireson, for instance, thought that the Bishop\ncould fit in mass with his household but not if he wanted to travel in one day with all\nhis train. For this sort of reason some of the witnesses made an episcopal day much\nshorter than that for an ordinary commercial traveller. William Dobyn from Durham\nCity, and Thomas de Wham, another chaplain from Durham, put the episcopal\nday in winter at twenty miles. William Boner, a chaplain from Kirklington in York\ndiocese though now subject to the bishop of Durham, and Walter de Wynerthorp\nanother chaplain, put it at twenty-four or even twenty miles, whereas Boner thought\nthe more ordinary travellers might cover thirty. John Travers, a forester of Girsby,\nhowever, said he had served the Bishops of Durham Louis de Beaumont and Richard\nde Bury for a long time, and they regularly did thirty-two miles a day in winter.\nBracton, calculating for merchants to come and go in one day and do business in\nbetween, had estimated twenty miles.10\n8 Victoria County History: City of York, ed.

These certainly included the crossing of the River Tees, which\nmarked the boundary between the dioceses of Durham and York. The journey out of\nthe diocese of Durham to York was understood by all the witnesses to go from\nDarlington over the Tees and from there via Northallerton, Thirsk, Tollerton, or\nHelperby and then to York. Robert de Sireson thought that one could go to Thirsk\n\u2018on a high way\u2019 [per altam viam] by Sessay and Easingwold. This journey, from\nDarlington by modern roads, is about forty-eight miles. Some witnesses were anxious\nto say that in winter-time the roads were dreadful. Walter de Wynerthorp considered\nthat from Martinmas (11 November) to 2 February the roads between York and\nNorthallerton \u2018are very muddy and difficult to travel on\u2019 [sunt valde lutose et difficile\nad transeundum]. John Travers of Meles agreed with him; it had been like this since\nlast Michaelmas, but he added \u2018except when there was a strong and great frost so that\nmen could pass over the frozen earth and water\u2019 [excepto quando fuit forte et magnum\ngelu ita quod homines poterant super terram et aquam congelatam transire]. John knew\nthat this journey was very difficult to do between All Saints (1 November) and\nMartinmas (11 November) because when he did do it he only stopped to eat at Thirsk\nand even then scarcely did it in one day.\nNot all the witnesses agreed with this, of course. John Travers of Girsby thought\nthat there was what he called \u2018a royal highway\u2019 [alta via regia strata] from the end\nof the vill of Girsby and through its fields from York towards Durham. Robert\nSireson thought that the road from Girsby was very short to York and \u2018very easy to\ntravel on\u2019 and he called it \u2018a royal road and a high and public way\u2019 [miliaria . . . facilia\nad transeundum et dicit quod regia strata et alta ac via publica].\nThe major obstacle to speedy travel out of the diocese of Durham southwards\nwas the crossing of the Tees, which for much of its length in County Durham marked\nthe boundary of the diocese, and most witnesses were questioned closely about\nthe nearest crossing places for those who wished to get to York. There was general\nagreement that the usual crossing point was at Neasham, about four miles from\nDarlington, where indeed two fords can still be discerned. The advantage of this\ncrossing was that it had a ford and a boat which could also take horses and clearly\nhad a regular ferry. Richard Talbot said that the usual custom for those going from\nDurham to York was to spend the night either at Darlington or Neasham. He knew\nof other ways over the river but said that Neasham was \u2018the most common way for\nordinary men\u2019 [majus commune passagium pro communibus hominibus]. The bishop\nhad a manor at Darlington in any case.11 William de Sockburn said that at Neasham\nthere was \u2018usually a boat ready for horsemen and all\u2019 [navicula que est ibi communiter\nparata pro equitibus et omnibus]. This meant that even if the water was high one could\nusually cross.\nThere were other crossings, however. If one looks at the map one can see that at\nSockburn the river does an enormous meander, thus taking the diocese of Durham\nnearer by about two miles to York than Neasham. According to some witnesses, two\n11 G. Cookson, The Townscape of Darlington, VCH Studies (2003), pp. 13\u201314, 23\u201326.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) U\nniv\ners\nity\n of\n Le\ned\ns\n124 TRAVEL FROM DURHAM TO YORK\npossible places could be used to cross there. Some of the witnesses talk of crossing at\nSockburn, others talk of crossing near Smeaton mill. These almost certainly describe\nthe same crossing viewed from either side of the river. There was a mill on the\nTees a mile beyond [Great] Smeaton, called by Alexander de Belingham \u2018the new\nmill\u2019 [de Smethton usque vadium et transitum iuxta molendinum quod vocatur novum\nmolendinum super aquam de Tese situatum est unum miliarem tantum] and there was\na ford where horsemen could cross.12 William de Sockburn said\nThose wishing to cross the water at the mill usually cross by the ford with their horses because\nthere is no boat for horses there . . . but only for those on foot who commonly cross there\n[Volentes transire aquam ad predictum molendinum communiter transeunt per vadium cum equis\nquia ibi non est navicula pro equis . . . sed dumtaxat pro hominibus peditibus qui communiter\ntranseunt ibidem].\nGalfridus de Thornton explained that there was \u2018no boat big enough for taking\nhorses there\u2019 [non est tam magna navicula ibidem que sufficiat ad transvehendum equos].\nWilliam de Munketon, however, said that there was both a boat and a ford at the\nmill. Richard Chalunner from Durham and John del Bires from Shincliffe near\nDurham both said that at the mill of Smeaton there was a common passage and\nboth agreed that when the water was low one could cross by boat and ford and\nwhen it was high by boat [est commune passagium quando aqua est alta et per vadium\net navem quando aqua est bassa (Chalunner). . commune passagium per navigium et\nquando aqua est bassa per equos]. Thomas Benet, rector of [Kirby] Sigston, knew the\ncrossing and knew also of its difficulties. He had crossed the ford on horse-back\n\u2018on Wednesday last\u2019 [die mercurii proxime preterito] \u2018and the water came up to his\nhorse\u2019s belly\u2019 [et aqua inde tetigit equum usque ventrem]. We need to remember that\nhe was giving his evidence in early February. John Dunwell of York however, who\nhad recently been in the service of Thomas Neville, the Archdeacon of Durham, had\ncrossed at Smeaton mill in summer and had seen there \u2018a safe boat for carrying men\nand horses\u2019 [unam securam navem ad portandam homines et equos].\nThe explanation of these different perceptions was given in part by Walter de\nMiddleham who explained that \u2018the miller usually kept a boat there in which he\ntook people on foot but he did not take horses unless the water was low\u2019 [molendarius\ndicti molendini tenet ibidem communiter unam naviculam per quam aliquando pedites\ncommuniter ibidem transeunt dictam aquam sed equites non transeunt ibidem nisi\nquando aqua est modica et bassa]. Robert Sireson said that people crossed by the\ncommon passage at the ford with horses at all times of year. . but there is not a common\ncrossing except with a horse and not by boat because there is not usually a boat except one for\nfishing which the miller of the mill keeps there [transeunt per vadium et est commune passagium\n. .cum equis omni tempore anni. .non sit ibidem communis transitus . . . nisi cum equo, non per\nnaviculam quia ibi non est communiter aliqua navicula nisi fuerit pro piscibus capiendis quam\nmolendarius dicti molendini ibidem tenuit] . . .\nJohn Travers of Girsby, however, said that at the mill there was not a common\npassage and people \u2018could only cross there if they were special friends or familiars\nof Sir Robert of Herill (or Herle)\u2019 [nisi sint speciales amici vel familiares domini Roberti\nde Herill]. Robert Herle was described by some (Roger of Dunnington and John of\n12 VCH, Yorks, North Riding, I, 198 for a mill in this area.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) U\nniv\ners\nity\n of\n Le\ned\ns\n125MARGARET HARVEY\nRavenston, the latter having also served his father) as a knight who was lord of\nGirsby and Sockburn. Sockburn was held by the Conyers family and this Robert\nmust have been a sub-tenant; Petronilla Conyers, daughter of Sir John Conyers,\nmarried a Robert Herle.13 The importance of his part in all this testimony was that the\ndiocese of Durham did not in fact end at the Tees at Sockburn, since the parish of\nSockburn, in Durham diocese, also included Girsby and what is now East Sockburn,\nover the water in North Yorkshire. Since the main point at issue was the nearest way\nout of the diocese of Durham to York, it mattered exactly where the boundary was.\nThe edge of Durham diocese at Girsby was much nearer to York than Neasham.\nOne or two witnesses showed very clear understanding of the jurisdictions involved.\nRobert de Sireson described how one could come to Durham diocese from York\nwithout crossing the Tees at all. The fields [campos] of Girsby were the nearest part\nof the diocese of Durham and Girsby was in the parish of Sockburn. Walter de\nMiddleham was even more specific. He said that the diocese ended at a certain\nwood called Thurstandale wood, (which is the modern Staindale Wood).14 Caldehall\nand this wood and the fields of Dinsdale were all in the diocese of Durham. Those\nquestioned about this attested that they knew that the area was in Sockburn parish\neither because the people of Girsby paid their tithes to Sockburn (William de\nSockburn) or because they buried their dead in Sockburn cemetery (William de\nMunketon).\nThis complicated set of jurisdictions also covered another way of crossing the river,\nbut one which was clearly not well known in 1361. If one came via the Girsby fields,\nMiddleham said there was a straight road to the river at Pountaysbrigg (Pontees-\nbridge). He said that this had been the crossing \u2018before the bridge was broken, which\nhe thought had happened about six years before\u2019 [ubi solebant homines communiter\ntransire antequam pons ille fuit confractus quod contigit hinc a sex annis elapsis ut\nrecolit]. He usually crossed at Sockburn. Ponteesbridge is mentioned only by two\nother persons. Robert de Sireson said that one could go through the Girsby fields\nto this bridge where there was a common passage over the Tees with horses. Adam\nde Dunelm, who lived in York, said that the bridge was near the mill and that\n\u2018men could now cross it and had been able to do so for about six months\u2019 [unus pons\nvocatus Pontasbrigg per quem homines transire nunc possunt et potuerunt per totum\ndimidium anni proxime iam preteriti]. So little known was this that the scribe who\ncopied it had first written Persbrigg (Piercebridge). Ponteesbrigg was a well-attested\nbridge across the river at Dinsdale which was probably Roman in origin and had a\nchapel and a hermitage.15 It is marked on the six-inch Ordnance Survey map of 1899\nas crossing the river at Dinsdale Park.16 As we have seen most of the travellers did not\nuse it, perhaps because they continued to think it was broken. There is no sign of a\nbridge there now but a track does lead down to where one may have been.\n13 R Surtees, The History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham, 4 vols (1823), III, 247.\n14 VCH, Yorks, North Riding, I, 449\u201354 for the whole parish of Sockburn.\n15 The Victoria History of the County of Durham, ed.

Those\ncoming south from Durham seem to have stayed the night at Darlington and\ncertainly the bishop could do so at his own manor. Many people coming the other\nway did the same. If they could not get to Darlington in time in winter they stayed\nat Northallerton. Thomas de Wham from Durham said that there was no common\nhospice at Neasham so that people either went to Smeaton or Darlington in one day.\nJohn de Ravenston, going from Darlington to York in summer, \u2018stopped in three\nplaces to feed his horse\u2019 [moratus fuit in tribus locis pascendo equum suum]. He did not\nsay where.\nSome of these witnesses tell one something about their travels and their jobs.\nWilliam Porter and Adam Serjaunt were both sellers of fish and both thought that\nthe journey via Sockburn was very difficult in winter. Porter said that he often\nbrought fish for sale from Durham diocese to York and more usually passed along\nthe roads at night \u2018as is usual for men of his kind exercising this kind of trade\u2019 [sicut\nest de more hominum sue condicionis exercencium huiusmodi mercimonium]. Adam\nsaid he was a fisherman [piscarius] who commonly journeyed with his horses bearing\nhis fish to sell beyond the diocese of Durham to the city of York at all times of year.\nHis day\u2019s journey began \u2018after the market at York or in other places, sometimes\nearlier, sometimes later and he travelled a lot at night\u2019 [post forum factum in Ebor vel\nin aliis locis diocesis Dunelm et aliquando citius et quandoque tardius et multum laborat\nin noctibus]. Thus he did not know what a day for an ordinary person might be.\nRobert, son of Peter of Girsby, recounted how last Lent he had travelled from Girsby\nto York \u2018with a horse carrying a sack of wool weighing twenty stones\u2019 [cum uno equo\nportante unum saccum de xx petris lane usque Ebor]. Several of those who said they\nknew the road from York to Darlington well, knew it because they went to the fairs\nat Darlington. Alexander de Belingham, who said he was from Eryholme, had seen\n\u2018several merchants and other artisans with their goods and carts\u2019 [plures mercatores et\nalios artifices cum suis mercimoniis et caragiis] at the time of the last Darlington fair\ntravelling from York to Darlington. This probably applied to the butchers of York.\nWilliam Waldyng, Thomas Doghty, William Attehall, John Coucy, and Robert de\nDuncolm. Roger of Dunyngton had been several times at the fair at Northallerton.17\nSeveral of the witnesses were employed by ecclesiastical persons. John de Dunwell\nsaid that he had not long since been in the household of Thomas Neville, Archdeacon\nof Durham. The Archdeacon was the son of Ralph, first Baron Neville of Raby, who\nbecame archdeacon in 1334 and was a senior canon of York at the time.18 He had\nbeen appointed one of the judges-delegate in this case by the papal curia but had\ndeclined because he was too busy.19 Very possibly he did not wish to be embroiled in\nwhat appears a very politically charged case. John Travers of Girsby had travelled\nwith the Bishops who employed him, Louis de Beaumont (1317 \u00d7 33) and Richard\n17 C. M. Newman, Late Medieval Northallerton.

William de Munketon travelled on his own business but also\nhad done business for the Prior of Durham at Howden and Hemingbrough, where the\npriory owned livings. Munketon was one of those who had given separate evidence\nabout the beginning of the case. He described how he had gone with Robert Litster,\nthe leading parishioner, to interview Hatfield in the course of the argument.20 Richard\nof Croxdale had gone from Darlington to Neasham \u2018on the Wednesday after the\nPurification last\u2019 (3 February 1361) and there had delivered a letter to the nun who\nwas the doorkeeper of the nuns at Neasham convent. John Travers de Meles, who\nthought even the way by Neasham was too muddy for the Bishop in winter, knew the\njourney because he had been with others attempting to ride it from York, and named\nthem as John de Appleby, Official of Durham and Master Simon de Neuton. Appleby\nwas probably the man who was soon to leave Durham for the Roman curia where\nhe became an advocate at the papal court.21 William de Esshe had travelled with\nHugh de Fletham and Hugh de Tesedale, both involved in the ecclesiastical courts.\nOne or two described the travels of the Bishop. John Travers of Girsby knew from\nmembers of the Bishop\u2019s household that the Bishop travelled from Bishop Auckland\nto Crayke, his manor near York and into much more remote parts. Walter Jakes\nhad seen the Bishop do this journey in winter. William Munketon had seen the Bishop\narriving at Crayke from Howden on the vigil of the Assumption last year (14 August\n1360) and he got there at about midday. Thomas Benet had travelled with the Bishop\nto London once with a clerk from the Bishop\u2019s household. The Bishop was clearly\nthought to be a frequent and intrepid traveller.\nIt is equally striking that some of the witnesses had travelled little and professed not\nto know roads with which one might have expected them at least to be acquainted.\nSeveral professed to know nothing of Sockburn or Smeaton, though familiar with\nNeasham. Examples were William de Caldebeck of Gateshead, John de Colchester\nand William Dobyn of Durham. William Whitberd of Durham had only done the\njourney from Neasham twice, once to come to give his evidence. Several were also\nanxious to disassociate themselves from any suggestions that they knew about bishops\nand their ways. The usual disclaimer was to say that those they knew about were\n\u2018ordinary people\u2019 [personas vulgares]. The former cloth merchant turned farmer,\nWilliam de Sockburn, was more emphatic, saying that \u2018he had not travelled much in\nthe company of bishops\u2019 [non multum laboravit in comitativa episcoporum].\nThus some of the perceptions of the ease or difficulty of the roads sprang from the\nsocial level of the persons involved. What one can discover about the witnesses shows\nvery varied status. There was, not surprisingly, a group of clergy. Hugo de Fletham,\na notary, was scribe to the York Chapter.22 Richard Talbot described himself as living\nin Durham with Master William de Farnham. Farnham was a canon lawyer, rector\nof Walkington, Official to Hatfield (an important judicial position), advocate of the\nConsistory court of Durham and a former chaplain to John Thoresby, Archbishop\nof York.23 Talbot must therefore have been in a very good position to know about\n20 DCM, Loc XXVII 26 (17).\n21 Emden, Oxford, I, 40\u201341.\n22 DCM, 1.3 Archiep.4, dated 1356.\n23 Notes from the card-index in 5, The College, Durham.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) U\nniv\ners\nity\n of\n Le\ned\ns\n128 TRAVEL FROM DURHAM TO YORK\nthe Bishop\u2019s habits. Thomas Benet, rector of Kirby Sigston, York diocese, would\nhave been appointed by Durham Priory, as would Thomas Bowes, rector of West\nRounton.24 In 1366, Thomas de Wham was rector of St Mary in the North Bailey,\nDurham City in the gift of Durham Priory also.25\nSeveral of the lesser clergy were chaplains living in Durham. Walter de Wynerthorp\nhad given evidence of the incident in St Nicholas church, Durham which had sparked\noff the trouble. He had seen it all from the nave.26 It would appear from the evidence\nconcerning \u2018days\u2019 that there was an attempt to impugn his good faith; \u2018asked whether\nhe was a criminal \u2018he did not wish to reply\u2019 [Interrogatus an sit criminosus dicit quod\nnon vult respondere]. Since the whole case had begun with an episcopal visitation some\ncriminal records may have surfaced. John de Baumburgh, a chaplain, can often be\nseen acting as either a trustee or as a conveyor of land in Durham City between 1356\nand 1380.27 In 1371 he acted for Robert Litster who was the leader of the parishioners\ninvolved in the case against Hatfield.28 Before 1376, and again (or still) in the 1380s\nhe was procurator of St Oswald\u2019s church, that is he acted as the agent for the priory\nin all the financial affairs of the parish.29 Walter Jakes, with his brother John who\nwas also a Durham chaplain, was yet another of these chaplains, who can be seen\ndoing business in property with Baumburgh in 1356.30 Walter also served as the\nchaplain of the country chapel of Croxdale, outside Durham but part of St Oswald\u2019s\nparish, between 1356 and 1359.31 Thomas Cupper can also be seen acting as a trustee\nfor property transactions in the city between 1364 and 1377.32 He was paid by\nthe priory for celebrating at St Margaret\u2019s chapel, a dependency of St Oswald\u2019s, in\n1368\u201369.33 William de Esshe had part of a tenement in Durham in 1382\u201383, which\nhad previously been held first by John de Smethton, then by Walter Jakes and then\nby Walter\u2019s sister Agnes. These people must therefore have known each other, but\nthen Durham was a very small city.34\nThe Durham and York laity who gave evidence can also sometimes be traced\nelsewhere. John de Colchester was probably the man who in 1352 with his wife Joan\ngranted a messuage in Elvet, Durham.35 Roger de Normanton seems to have owned,\nwith his wife, a tenement in the marketplace in Durham in 1362.36 William Porter held\na burgage in Alvertongate in 1352.37 There is an Adam de Serjaunt, perhaps the father\n24 VCH, Yorks, North Riding, I, 409, 446; Benet was a witness to DCM, 1.3.Archiep.4, in 1356.\n25 R.

What it tells about Pontees-\nbridge, for instance, is not found anywhere else. It is in any case very unusual to find\nsuch a diverse group discussing travel conditions in this way. What it also reveals is\nthat, preposterous though in one sense it seems, the Bishop probably had a point\nwhen he said that travel for him was difficult in winter. One can read between some of\nthe lines to see that although the distances stated could be done in winter they often\nmight not be achieved and certainly not by anyone travelling in any style. It is not\npossible to think of the Bishop of Durham crossing the Tees quickly even over the\nford at Neasham, and even in summer, which all agreed was easy enough, or striding\nout like a merchant with a packhorse.\nAPPENDIX\n(Names of Witnesses)\nATTEHALL, William, butcher [carnifex] and citizen of York.
