INTRODUCTION\nIn Perera v Civil Service Commission (No 2) ([1983] ICR 428, followed in Meer v London  Borough  of  Tower  Hamlets  [1988]\nIRLR  399)  the  Court  of  Appeal  created  an  anomaly  in  British  discrimination  law  has  been  allowed  to  grow  and  become\nestablished.  The facts were that Mr Perera applied for a  post  as  a  legal  assistant.   The  selection  criteria  stated  inter  alia  that\n\u2019candidates with a good command of the English language, experience  in  the  UK  and  with  British  nationality  would  be  at  an\nadvantage\u2019.  Mr Perera argued that those criteria had an adverse impact on persons of his (Sri Lankan) racial group.   The  Court  of\nAppeal did not get as far as that argument, holding that the selection criteria, expressed as  \u2019mere  preferences\u2019  did  not  amount  to\n\u2019absolute bars\u2019 to the job and thus fell outside of the definition of discrimination provided  by  s  1(1),  Race  Relations  Act,  which\ndemands that the employer applies a \u2019requirement or condition\u2019.  Stephenson, LJ reasoned (at 437):\n            \u2019...a brilliant man whose personal qualities made him  suitable  as  a  legal  assistant  might\nwell have been sent forward... in spite of being, perhaps, below standard on his knowledge\nof English...\u2019\nThat comment reveals the problem.  If a candidate has to be \u2019brilliant\u2019 in order to  compensate  for\na racially based \u2019weakness\u2019 then he is at a disadvantage because of  his  race.   A  \u2019brilliant\u2019  black\nperson will obtain a post otherwise suitable for an \u2019average\u2019 white person.\nIt was the use of the word advantage in the criteria which ensured that the advertisement did not infringe the Act.  Only  if\nthe advertisement were modified to read \u2019Candidates must have an excellent command of English...\u2019  would  it  have  infringed  the\nlegislation, so the Court stated.  This is because in that modified example each criterion is promoted from a \u2019mere preference\u2019  to  a\n\u2019requirement or condition\u2019.\nClearly the aim of Britain\u2019s discrimination legislation is to prevent racial groups and women being\nput at a disadvantage.  Yet Perera stands in the way of fulfilment of that aim.\nSince Perera was decided in 1983 it has been  followed  many  times  -  until  now.   In  Falkirk  Council  v  Whyte  a  Scottish\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal may have made history by being the first tribunal or court in Britain  expressly  to  turn  its  back  on\nPerera and open the door to an overdue change to the law.\nThe anomaly created by Perera stems from the British definition  of  indirect  discrimination,  which  is  based  upon  the\nlandmark decision of the US Supreme Court in Griggs v Duke Power Co 401 US 424 (1971).  In  this  case  Duke  Power  required\neither a high school diploma or the passing of intelligence tests as conditions of employment, transfer or promotion.   Consequently\na disproportionate number of blacks were rendered ineligible for employment, transfer or promotion, as the  case  may  have  been.\nThese requirements could not be shown to be related to  job  performance.   Section  703(a)  of  Title  VII,  Civil  Rights  Act  1964\nprovided that it was unlawful employment practice for an employer to limit, segregate, or classify  employees  to  deprive  them  of\nemployment opportunities or adversely to affect their status because of race, colour, religion, sex, or national origin.   However  no\ndefinition of discrimination was provided by the legislation.  Further, s. 703(h) authorised the use of any  professionally  developed\nability test, provided that it was not \u2019designed, intended, or used to discriminate because of race....\u2019  In  their  defence  Duke  Power\nshowed that they had not intended that the tests should have a disparate impact on blacks.  However the Supreme court held that  s.\n703 only allowed ability tests so far as they could be shown to be related to job  performance.   As  the  employer  could  not  show\nthat, they were unlawful.  This was so even though the employer did not intend to discriminate.  In delivering the  judgment  of  the\ncourt Burger, CJ gave a classic account of the reasoning of indirect discrimination (at 429):\n            \u2019Congress has now provided that tests or criteria for  employment  or  promotion  may  not\nprovide equality of opportunity merely in the sense of the fabled offer of milk to  the  stork\nand the fox.  On the contrary, Congress has now required that the posture and condition  of\nthe job-seeker be taken into account.  It has - to resort again to the fable - provided that the\nvessel in which the milk is proffered be one all seekers can  use.   The  Act  proscribes  not\nonly overt discrimination but also practices  that  are  fair  in  form,  but  discriminatory  in\noperation.   The  touchstone  is  business  necessity.   If  an   employment   practice   which\noperates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice\nis prohibited.\u2019\nThis has become known as disparate impact theory.  The British definition of indirect discrimination is  based  upon  this\ntheory.  It can be seen that the theory rests upon two broad limbs.   First,  the  claimant  must  show  that  a  practice  has  led  to  an\nadverse impact on a protected group.  For example  where  a  high  school  diploma  is  a  condition  of  employment  and  a  higher\nproportion of whites than blacks complete high school.  Second, the burden shifts to the defendant to  prove  that  the  practice  was\nnecessary to achieve the aim.  For instance, was a high school diploma necessary to perform the job?  Note where  the  burden  lies\nfor each element.\nThe inclusion of provisions for indirect discrimination in Britain\u2019s legislation is a  direct  result  of\nthe then (Labour) Home Secretary\u2019s (Roy Jenkins, now  Lord  Jenkins  of  Hillhead)  discovery  of\nGriggs whilst on a trip to the United States.  Mr Jenkins, upon his return, introduced section 1(1)(b) (indirect discrimination)  in  a\nlate amendment to the 1975 Sex Discrimination Bill.  A definition of indirect discrimination was included in the  Bill  and  became\nlaw.  That last  minute  inclusion  explains  why  the  White  Paper  (Equality  for  Women  Cmnd  5724)  which  preceded  the  Bill\ncontained no indication of the Government\u2019s understanding of, and policy towards, indirect discrimination.\nA year later the same definition was  included  in  the  Race  Relations  Act  1976.   This  time  the\nrespective White Paper, Race Relations (Cmnd. 6234), included some indication of the Government\u2019s aims in  introducing\nindirect discrimination laws.  However, the imprecise use of language in that  document  made  matters  no  clearer.   This  perhaps\nreflected the Government\u2019s failure to foresee  the  general  lack  of  enthusiasm  that  the  judiciary  would  have  for  implementing\nindirect discrimination law.\nThe White Paper on Race Relations stated that direct discrimination laws alone could not address the \u2019practices and\nprocedures which have a discriminatory effect\u2019 and \u2019practices which are fair in a formal sense but discriminatory in their  operation\nand effect\u2019 (at para 35).  Clearly the sentiment here can be traced  to  Griggs.  Further  on  the  Government  outlined  the  intended\nlegislation.  In place of the words \u2019practice and procedure\u2019, one finds \u2019requirement and condition\u2019  (at  para  55).   It  is  this  phrase\nwhich is at the root of the anomaly, and has been used by the Court of Appeal to narrow considerably the scope of the Act.\nWhen the American two-limbed theory (see Griggs, above) of indirect  discrimination  was  translated  into  British\nlegislation, (ie Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and Race Relations Act 1976, and  by  a  1989  amendment,  s.  16,  Fair  Employment\n(Northern Ireland) Act 1976) more detail was added.  The same formula, with necessary adjustments, was used in s.  1(1)(b),  Race\nRelations Act and s. 16 Fair Employment (NI) Act.\nSection 1(1)(b), SDA defines indirect discrimination thus:\n\u20191(1) A person discriminates against a woman in any circumstances relevant\nfor the purposes of this Act if -\n(a)...\n(b)            he applies to her a requirement or condition which he applies or would apply equally to a man but,\n(i)         which is such that  the  proportion  of  women  who  can  comply  with  it  is  considerably\nsmaller than the proportion of men who can comply with it, and\n(ii)        which he cannot show to be justifiable irrespective of the sex of the person to  whom  it  is\napplied, and\n(iii)      which is to her detriment because she cannot comply with it.\u2019\nIn broad terms that means that to make out a case the complainant  would  have  to  show  that  the\nemployer applied an apparently  neutral  requirement  which  had  a  disparate  impact  on  women\n(including the complainant) and was not justified.\n2. WHYTE AT FIRST INSTANCE\nIn Whyte the  appellant  employer  advertised  a  post  of  first-level  line  manager.   One  of  the  selection  criteria  stated  that\n\u2019management training and supervisory experience\u2019 was \u2019desirable\u2019.  The three  respondent  complainants  each  made  unsuccessful\napplications for the post.  They alleged that the criterion above amounted to unlawful  sex  discrimination  because  a  considerably\nlesser proportion of women than men had such experience. (The applicants themselves  had  no  such  experience.)   The  industrial\ntribunal upheld their claim and the employer appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal (\u2019EAT\u2019).\n3. WHYTE ON APPEAL\nThe EAT dismissed the employer\u2019s appeal.  They noted that the  preponderance  of  women  in  basic  grade  social  work  posts  in\ncontrast to promoted posts was \u2019so overwhelming\u2019 that it was \u2019inevitable\u2019 that any requirement  for  prior  management  experience\nwould disadvantage women.  Further, they upheld the industrial tribunal\u2019s finding that the criterion and the weight  placed  upon  it\nby the employer was not justified: this was only a first level managerial post and  so  it  was  wrong  to  attach  such  importance  to\nprevious experience in contrast to other qualities, including, aptitude.\nHowever the main - and most interesting - issue concerned  the  statutory  phrase  \u2019requirement  or\ncondition\u2019.  As we have seen, since 1983 (Perera) the Court of Appeal has maintained that  s.  1(1),  SDA  demands\nthat the defendant employer must have applied a \u2019requirement or condition\u2019 in the sense of an \u2019absolute bar\u2019 to the job.\nIt will be recalled that in Whyte the employer stated that management training and supervisory experience was  \u2019desirable\u2019,\nrather than say \u2019necessary\u2019 or \u2019essential\u2019.  Thus it may have been possible for an applicant without such experience to  still  get  the\njob.  In other words the criterion did not amount to an \u2019absolute bar\u2019 to the job and, according to Perera, fell  outside  the  scope  of\nthe Act.  The EAT held otherwise, for two reasons.\nFirst, the industrial tribunal found that although the criterion was expressed as a \u2019mere preference\u2019 in practice\nit operated as an absolute bar.  They noted that one of the complainants would have got the  post  but  for  her  lack  of  supervisory\nexperience.  This distinction between form and substance was a finding of fact which the EAT - as an appellate  tribunal  -  did  not\nfeel able to interfere with.  Not only is this a refreshingly positive and realistic approach,  it  should  be  the  correct  one.   The  Act\ndemands that a requirement is applied.  It does not demand that one is merely expressed.  Yet in  most  cases  on  this  point  courts\nhave failed to look behind the form of a criterion, allowing employers to avoid the anti-discrimination  legislation.   One  exception\nis Jones v University of Manchester ([1993] ICR 474) where the English Court of Appeal took a similar line to the EAT  in  Whyte:\nthey refused to interfere with an industrial tribunals\u2019 finding  that  a  criterion  (\u2019candidates  aged  between  27-35  years  would  be\npreferred\u2019) was in practice applied as an absolute bar.  However that decision was confined  to  a  finding  of  fact  and  in  no  way\nundermined the authority of Perera, which was applied.\nOn that ground alone the decision could rest.  But the EAT went on to approve a line of  reasoning\ntaken by counsel for the complainants.  Lord Johnston recalled:\n            \u2019It was counsel\u2019s essential submission that one should not interpret the words \"requirement\nor  condition\"  on  any  narrow  or  restricted  basis,  having  regard  to  the   fact   that   the\nlegislation was based upon European Directive No 207\/76 [the Equal Treatment Directive]\ncovering   sex   discrimination   which   therefore   fell   to   be   treated   differently    from\ndiscrimination on grounds of race.  Since the employers here were part of the emanation of\nthe State, this tribunal, and indeed the industrial tribunal, could apply the Directive without\nreference to the legislation; but, in any event, if the legislation required it to be  interpreted\non any particular basis it should be consistent with the purpose of  the  Directive  -  the  so-\ncalled \"purposive approach\" which can be found supported by the House of Lords in  Litster\nv Forth Dry Dock Engineering Co Ltd [1990] 1 AC 546.  He submitted that Perera had been rightly criticised even in the\ncontext of race relations (Meer v Tower Hamlets London Borough Council [1988]  IRLR  399,  CA),  which  was  all  the\nmore reason for not applying it to the scope of sex discrimination.  The proper approach  should  be  whether  or  not  the\nfactor, to give it a neutral phrase, hindered women as opposed to men in the particular context,  here  the  application  for\nthe post in question.\u2019\nLord Johnston concluded:\n            \u2019In many ways this was  a  classic  situation  of  indirect  sex  discrimination,  with  mostly\nwomen in basic grade posts, and mostly  men  in  promoted  management  posts  -  a  vivid\nexample of what the Act and its forerunners in the United States set out to eliminate, ie those\npractices which had a disproportionate impact on women and were not justifiable for other reasons...\u2019\n4. ANALYSIS\nThis  judgment  was  unusual  in  that  Lord  Johnston  adopted  the   words   of   counsel   for   the\ncomplainants as part of his reasoning.  And the decision was made without any apparent reference\nto conflicting authority or the minor errors in counsel\u2019s submission.\n(a) The Errors in Whyte\nOf the minor failings the first was that the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 was not based upon the Equal\nTreatment Directive.  The Directive was not even adopted until 1976  (OJ  L39\/76)  and  came  into  force  in  1978.   Whereas  the\nDirective is solely concerned with employment matters the SDA covers education and the supply of services, goods,  facilities  and\npremises as well as employment.  See also Duke v GEC Reliance [1988] AC 618, HL.  However, although the proposition (that the\nSDA was based on the Directive) is mistaken the conclusion deriving from it is not.  According to  the  European  Court  of  Justice\n(\u2019ECJ\u2019) domestic courts should interpret domestic legislation as far as possible to accord with a Directive whether the domestic law\nin question was enacted before or after the Directive (Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimintacion Case C 106\/89\n[1990] 1 CMLR 305.\nSecond, Litster was cited as authority for the  \u2019purposive\u2019  approach  to  interpretation  of  the  domestic  legislation.   Whereas\nLitster is an adequate authority, there are more appropriate ones.  In Whyte the Equal Treatment  Directive  was  directly  effective.\nThis is because the employer was an \u2019emanation of the State\u2019 who was thus bound to implement the Directive.  However in  Litster\nthe employer was a private party and  so  not  obliged  to  implement  the  Directive.   That  was  a  case  where  the  Directive  was\nindirectly effective.  More appropriate House of Lords authorities would have been Garland v  British  Rail  Engineering  [1983]  2\nAC 751 and Pickstone v Freeman [1989] AC 66.  The principle is the  same  though:  so  far  as  it  is  possible  to  do  so  domestic\nlegislation should interpreted to accord with the wording and purpose of the Directive.  In cases of direct  effect  only,  if  the  court\ncannot interpret the statute to accord with the Directive they may simply ignore the statute and apply the  Directive  itself  -  that  is\nthe principle of supremacy of EC law: Factortame v Secretary of State for Transport [1990] 2 AC 85, HL.  In  Whyte  no  authority\nwas cited for that proposition.\n(b) Conflicting Authorities: Does Perera apply to the SDA?\nThe  second  shortcoming  concerns  the  absence  of  the  conflicting  authorities.  One   of   those\nauthorities was in fact Meer which was cited in support of the decision to disregard Perera.  Meer was heard in 1988, some\nfive years after the Perera decision.  The facts were broadly similar to Perera and so the Court felt bound  by  precedent  to  follow\nPerera.  However only one (of three) Court of Appeal judges expressed a doubt over the correctness of Perera;  Balcombe, LJ said\nobiter that had he not been bound there were \u2019strong arguments\u2019 that Perera \u2019may not be consistent with the object of  the  Act\u2019  (at\n403).  On the other hand Dillon, LJ  expressed  no  opinion  on  Perera  whilst  Staughton,  LJ  positively  endorsed  it  stating  that\notherwise s. 1(1)(b) \u2019would have such an extraordinary wide and capricious effect\u2019 (at 403).\nPut simply Meer is a conflicting case containing one obiter dictum, which may weaken its authority but which  cannot  destroy\nit.  It cannot be said, as the EAT did, that the speeches Meer, taken as a whole, criticised Perera; on balance they supported it.\nIn Whyte, Perera was distinguished as being a case concerning the Race Relations Act  and  not  the  Sex  Discrimination  Act.   Of\ncourse Meer could be distinguished that basis too.  However the EAT did not consider a number of cases where the construction  in\nPerera was applied to the Sex Discrimination Act.  For instance: in the Court of Appeal,  Jones  v  University  of  Manchester  (see\nabove) and in Employment Appeal  Tribunals,  Meikle  v  Nottingham  City  Council  EAT\/249\/92,  (Transcript)  14th  April  1994,\nLondon Borough of Greenwich v Robinson EAT\/745\/94, (Transcript) 21st November 1995, Mutemasango v  Staffline  Recruitment\nLtd EAT\/517\/95, (Transcript) 13th May 1996 and Connelly v Strathclyde Regional Council EAT\/1039\/94, (Transcript)  8th  March\n1995.  This last case, where a Scottish EAT held (reluctantly) that they were bound by Perera, was in  fact  cited  by  the  employer\nbut not dealt with in Lord Johnston\u2019s speech.\n(c) Conflicting Authorities: The status of EC law\nThere are several judicial statements asserting that section 1(1), of the Sex Discrimination  Act  is  unaffected  by  EC  law.   These\nassertions are responses to Enderby v Frenchay Health Authority [1994] ICR 112.  In this case a speech therapist made  a  claim  of\nequal pay for work of equal value.  She compared her pay with that of a pharmacist who, it was accepted did work of  equal  value.\nThe vast majority of speech therapists were women and most of the pharmacists were men.  The pay of  both  workers  was  set  by\ncollective bargaining: each group (that is speech therapists and pharmacists) having a  separate  agreement.   Therefore  this  was  a\ncase of indirect discrimination.\nNow the relevant domestic legislation in this case is the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination\nAct.  The Equal Pay Act provides, inter alia, that there shall be equal pay for work of equal value.   But  only  the  Sex\nDiscrimination Act provides a definition of indirect  discrimination  (s.  1(1)(b),  above).   Article  119  of  the  Treaty  of  Rome  is\ndirectly effective here as well: See Jenkins v Kingsgate (Case 96\/80) 1981 ECR 911.\nThe Health Authority argued, inter alia, that the Equal Pay Act was but a detailed exposition of the  Sex  Discrimination\nAct; an equal pay claim may be based  upon  direct  or  indirect  discrimination.   In  either  case  a  court  should  look  to  the  Sex\nDiscrimination Act for a definition of the type of discrimination in question.  Therefore, the Health Authority  argued,  in  an  equal\npay case based on indirect discrimination, the applicant must show that there was a requirement or  condition  (as  stipulated  by  s.\n1(1)(b), SDA) applied by them, which caused the variation in pay.  No such requirement had been applied to any  speech  therapist.\nDoctor Enderby could train and qualify as a pharmacist and receive the preferable remuneration.  There was no barrier in  her  way\nbecause she was a woman.  The only cause of the lower pay was her decision to enter a less well paid profession.\nThe case went all the way to the ECJ where it was held that in equal pay claims under Article  119\nit was not necessary to show that the employer had applied a \u2019requirement or  condition\u2019.   Thus  it\nwas  not  possible  to  import  into  the  British  Equal  Pay  Act  1970  the  definition   of   indirect\ndiscrimination from the Sex Discrimination Act, even though the two  Acts  form  \u2019a  single  code\u2019\n(Shields v Coome Holdings [1978] ICR 1159 CA and Rainey v Greater Glasgow Health Board [1987] AC 224, HL) and  only  the\nSDA provides a definition of indirect discrimination.\nClearly Enderby is authority for the proposition that the element \u2019applies a requirement or condition\u2019 does not apply to  cases  of\nequal pay - under Article 119 or the EPA.  But does this principle of Enderby extend to cases brought under the Sex Discrimination\nAct and even the Race Relations Act?  Judges in three English cases have commented  on  the  effect  of  Enderby.   They  have  all\nconfined it to equal pay claims only.\nIn the first case, British Coal v Smith ([1994] ICR 810), Balcombe, LJ speaking for the Court of Appeal stated:\n            \u2019In our judgement, the result of Enderby is that a clear  distinction  has  to  be  made  between  the  \u2019objective\njustification\u2019 required by Article 119 of the Treaty... and the separate question whether indirect discrimination as  defined\nin the British statute, which requires the positive application of a requirement or condition,  is  shown  to  be  \"justifiable\"\npursuant to section (1)(b)(ii) of the [Sex Discrimination] Act of 1975.\u2019\nIn Ratcliffe v North Yorkshire County Council ([1995] 3 All ER 597, HL), in a speech with which the  other  Law  Lords  agreed,\nLord Slynn (without referring directly to Enderby) stated:\n            \u2019In my opinion the 1970 [Equal Pay] Act must be interpreted in its amended form  without\nbringing in the distinction between so-called \"direct\" and \"indirect\" discrimination.\u2019\nThe third English case to comment on the effect of Enderby was Bhudi v  IMI  Refiners  [1994]  ICR  307,  EAT.\nThis was a claim under the Sex Discrimination Act where the Equal Treatment Directive had indirect effect only.  In  this  case  the\nrespondents  employed  full-time  (mainly  men)  and  part-time  (mainly  women)  cleaners.   They  made  the   part-time   cleaners\nredundant because: (a) they were administered by a  separate  department;  (b)  they  worked  out-of-office  hours,  unlike  the  full-\ntimers; and (c) it was (therefore) cheaper to contract  out  the  part-time  work.   This  adversely  affected  women.   The  employers\nargued that no \u2019requirement\u2019 had been applied for the  purposes  of  section  1(1)(b)  of  the  Sex  Discrimination  Act.   Mrs  Bhudi\ncontended that the result of Enderby was that there was no longer a need to prove that there was a requirement  in  the  sense  of  an\n\u2019absolute bar\u2019.\nMummery, J rejected Mrs Bhudi\u2019s contentions on two  grounds.   First,  he  stated  that  Enderby  was\nconfined to cases on equal pay brought under Article 119.  Second (at 315), the Tribunal was bound by House of  Lords\u2019  authority\nthat it was open to a domestic court to interpret a statute in accordance with a directive, as interpreted by the  ECJ,  \u2019only  if  it  was\npossible to do so\u2019.  But as the phrase in section 1(1)(b) SDA was \u2019not open to  divergent  interpretations\u2019  this  could  not  be  done.\n(Mummery,  J  cited  for  support  the  House  of  Lords\u2019  decisions  in  Duke  v  Reliance  Systems  [1988]  AC  618,   Finnegan   v\nClowney [1990] 2 AC 407 and Webb v Emo Air Cargo [1988] 1 WLR 49.  The judgement did however recognise  (at  315)  that  at\nsome time in the future a higher court (\u2019probably the ECJ\u2019) may hold that the Equal Treatment Directive applies to all cases of  sex\ndiscrimination and that the domestic legislation would have to be amended accordingly.)  Thus it is  clear  that  the  English  judges\nare stoutly defending any attacks on the Perera doctrine based on Enderby.\nIt would seem then that the state of the authorities before the tribunals  in  Whyte  were  this.   The  notion\n\u2019requirement or condition\u2019 does not apply in claims of equal pay where that claim is based upon indirect sex discrimination.  In  all\nother cases of indirect discrimination (ie under the SDA, RRA and presumably the  Fair  Employment  (NI)  Act)  the  complainant\nmust show that there was a \u2019requirement or condition\u2019 in the form of an \u2019absolute bar\u2019: Perera is still good law although it  is  clear\nthat this anomaly is under pressure from Europe.\n(d) Arguments to Support Whyte\nThe EAT in Whyte failed to consider any of these conflicting authorities.  If they were faced with them, could they  have,  with\nreasons, come to the same decision?\nFirst it is clear that in case where the Directive has direct  effect  that  Directive  will  prevail  over\nconflicting domestic law.  So the next stage is to inquire as to  whether  the  Directive  demands  a\n\u2019requirement or condition\u2019 in the form of an \u2019absolute bar\u2019.  There are no ECJ cases on that  point.\nHowever the Directive does not expressly demand a \u2019requirement\u2019.   Further,  in  related  fields  of\ndiscrimination law the ECJ has declined to make the  distinction  between  a  \u2019preference\u2019  and  an\n\u2019absolute bar\u2019: Enderby (under A 119, equal pay) and Ingetraut Scholz v  Opera  Universitaria  di  Cagliari  Case  C-419\/92\n[1994] ECR 1-507 (under A 48, which prohibits discrimination based on nationality between workers of Member States).   Thus  it\nseems highly unlikely that one could import such a notion into  the  Directive.   Accordingly  the  EAT  in  Whyte  were  correct  to\nassume that the Directive could offer a remedy if the domestic law could not.\nThe next point is the interpretive one.  The EAT felt that it was possible  to  interpret  the  SDA  in\naccordance with the Directive.  This is, in many ways, a more important point.  This is because  in\ncases where the employer is not an emanation of the State, the Directive shall only have indirect effect.  In other words  a\ncourt could not apply the Directive.  The only recourse to EC law is by interpreting section 1(1) in accordance  with  the  Directive.\nIn Whyte the EAT thought that that was possible.  In Bhudi they  thought  that  it  was  not.   The  better  view  was  held  in  Whyte.\nLogically, a criterion expressed as a \u2019preference\u2019 is a requirement: it is an absolute bar to gaining an advantage in the job  selection\nprocedure.  This interpretation in no way distorts the statutory words and accords  with  the  purpose  of  the  domestic  statute  and,\nmore importantly, with the Directive.\nThere is support for  this  view  in  Australia,  where  there  is  similarly  worded  legislation.   The\nFederal Court of Western Australia refused to follow Perera in Secretary of Department of Foreign  Affairs  and\nTrade And: Styles ((1989) 88 ALR 621, see also Waters v Public  Transport  Corporation  (1991)  173  CLR  349,  High  Court  of\nAustralia).\n5. CONCLUSION\nThe tribunals in Whyte are to be commended for being the first to confront the absurdity which is Perera.  As  we  have  seen\nthe decision can be supported on three grounds.  (1) The Equal Treatment Directive, which does not demand an \u2019absolute bar\u2019 was,\nin this case, directly effective.  It was thus open to the tribunal to disregard conflicting  UK  law  and  simply  apply  the  Directive.\nFactortame is authority for that.  (2) In substance - if not in form - it was possible to conclude that  an  \u2019absolute  bar\u2019  to  selection\nhad been applied.  Jones is Court of Appeal authority for that.  (3)  It was possible to construe s. 1(1)(b), SDA  in  accordance  with\nthe Equal Treatment Directive  without  distorting  the  statutory  words.   The  construction  would  be  that  s.  1(1)(b)  includes  a\nrequirements needed to be put at an advantage in the selection process.\nHowever, in the short term, the case will present problems.  The absence of citation of  conflicting\ncases and miner errors undermine its authority.  In any future hearing on similar facts Whyte could  be\neasily distinguished for those reasons.  So, at present, the case may be  of little help to claimants.  But  that  does  not  mean  to  say\nthat it favours employers -  for the law is now uncertain.  Clearly an appeal is  needed  to  restore  certainty  and,  one  might  hope,\ndrive the absurdity of Perera out of British law for good.  As Perera is a Court of Appeal decision, the  only  place  for  that  is  the\nHouse of Lords, or even the European Court of Justice.\nPost Script.\nSince Whyte the European Commission has published the Burden of Proof Directive (97\/80\/EC).  Article 2 provides a  definition\nof  indirect  discrimination,  which  \u2019shall  exist  where  an  apparently  neutral  provision,  criterion  or   practice   disadvantages   a\nsubstantially higher proportion of the members of one sex...\u2019.  Clearly Whyte accords with this definition and Perera does not.  The\nBritish Government are obliged to implement the Directive by 1st January 2001 and in doing so they will abolish Perera.\n"}
