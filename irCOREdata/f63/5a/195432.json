Semiconducting nanotube (NT) quantum dots are technologically important. Recent\nadvances include the first measurement of the addition energy of a semiconducting NT quantum dot [1]\nand the fabrication of a room temperature single electron transistor (SET) based on a semiconducting NT\nquantum dot [2]. However, although these novel 1D artificial atoms are important, their physics is not\nwell understood. One of the major problems is that the nature of the quantum dot confinement potential\nis unknown and we address this problem here. We describe an effective mass approach for calculating\nthe states of a few interacting electrons in a NT quantum dot and investigate the effect of the confinement\npotential on the dot addition energy.\nWe are interested in quantum dots similar to the dot in the NT SET device studied by Jarillo-Herrero et\nal [1]. In this device, a semiconducting tube is placed between two metallic contacts and separated from\na back-gate by a thin insulating layer. The SET operation is controlled by a quantum dot which is formed\nnear the tube centre where electrons may be confined electrostically. The difficulty is that the exact form\nof this dot confinement is not understood. The total confinement will probably contain contributions from\nboth the back-gate potential and the Schottky barriers at the interface between the nanotube and the contacts\n[1]. While the contribution from the back-gate will be approximately harmonic close to the tube centre,\nthe Schottky barrier contribution is more difficult to estimate. Although the exact form of the confinement\npotential is unknown it is clear that it will lie somewhere between a smoothly varying harmonic potential\nand an abruptly varying hard wall potential. We compare the few particle charge density and addition\nenergy for these two extremes of the NT quantum dot confinement and show that the confinement in the\nexperimental system is more likely to be harmonic.\n2 Calculation. We calculate the states of a few interacting electrons in a semiconducting NT quantum\ndot. We use a dot model based on the NT quantum dot studied experimentally by Jarillo-Herrero et al [1].\nIn this type of quantum dot electrons are confined at the centre of a nanotube of roughly a few hundred\n\u2217 Corresponding author: e-mail: mr6@le.ac.uk, Phone: +44 116 2523582, Fax: +44 116 2522770\npss data will be provided by the publisher\n2 Mervyn Roy and P. A. Maksym: A semiconducting nanotube quantum dot\nnanometres in length, L. Typically, the dot length scales are a few tens of nanometres and the dot energy\nscales are of the order of a few, to a few tens, of meV. We consider nanotubes with a band gap, Eg ,\nmuch larger than this energy scale and a unit cell length, T , much smaller than this length scale. We can\nthen ignore the excitations of the radial and angular tube sub-bands and the nanotube dot is effectively\none dimensional. We describe the interacting electrons in this dot with the single band effective mass\nHamiltonian,\nH =\nN\u2211\ni\n\u2212~2\n2m\u2217\nd2\ndz2i\n+ U(zi) +\n\u2211\ni6=j\nV (|zi \u2212 zj |), (1)\nwhere N is the number of electrons, U(zi) is the single particle confinement potential and V (|zi \u2212 zj |)\nis the effective Coulomb interaction. We calculate the effective mass, m\u2217, from a 4 orbital, 3rd nearest\nneighbour, tight binding calculation with the parameterisation of Porezag et al [3].\nTo calculate the few electron states we diagonalise the Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) exactly in a basis of\ndeterminantal functions. We are interested in two types of single particle confinement potential, either\nhard wall (U(z) = \u2212Vo, |z| < L2 , 0 otherwise) or harmonic (U(z) =\n1\n2\nm\u2217\u03c92z2) confinement. In each\ncase we expand the interacting few electron states in the determinantal basis that diagonalises the single\nelectron part of the Hamiltonian. This ensures that the calculation is efficient and allows us to converge the\nground state energy to within 0.1%. Typically we need to include approximately 105 Slater determinants\nin the expansion to obtain this level of convergence for 6 electrons.\nWe derive the effective Coulomb interaction between two electrons in the dot from the standard form\nof the interaction between charged particles on the surface of a cylinder. If we assume that the interaction\ncannot scatter electrons between the angular sub-bands of the tube then,\nV (|z|) =\ne2\n4pi\u000fo\u000fr\n\u221a\n|z2|+ 4R2\n2\npi\nK\n(\n2R\u221a\n|z2|+ 4R2\n)\n, (2)\nwhere z = zi \u2212 zj , R is the nanotube radius, \u000fr is the relative permittivity of the nanotube, and K is an\nelliptic integral of the first kind. Close to z = 0 the interaction diverges like log(z) and, as expected, the\ninteraction depends inversely on R: for larger tubes the effective Coulomb interaction is smaller.\nThe semiconducting nanotube in the Jarillo-Herrero device is a 35,0 zigzag tube. In the zigzag class of\ntubes the conduction band is doubly degenerate and we should include the effect of both bands in equation\n(1). However, in any real nanotube SET device, this degeneracy will be broken by, for example, the\nelectric field across the nanotube, or a lack of rotational symmetry at the contacts. We have investigated\nthe effect of the band splitting with a 2 band calculation [4] and we find that the ground state energies, and\nhence the addition energies are relatively insensitive to the splitting. At large splittings (\u2248 ~\u03c9) the results\nof the single band and 2 band calculations are identical. We know that the bands in the experimentally\ninvestigated nanotube must be significantly split because the measured addition energy oscillates with a\nperiod of 2 electrons. There is no evidence for any 4 electron periodicity which would signify the presence\nof a second degenerate, or nearly degenerate, band. The single band Hamiltonian (Eq. (1)) is therefore a\ngood approximation to the Hamiltonian of the NT dot device investigated in the experiment.\n3 Results. We have calculated the few electron charge densities and the addition energies for quantum\ndots with both harmonic and hard wall confinement in a 35,0 zigzag nanotube of length L = 270 nm\n(R = 1.37 nm, m\u2217 = 0.0345, T = 0.426 nm, and Eg = 262.4 meV). The NT dot addition energy is given\nby, EA(N) = EN+1 \u2212 2EN + EN\u22121, where EN is the ground state energy of the N electron dot. The\nvariation in EA with N essentially depends on the ratio between the single particle confinement energy\nand the Coulomb interaction strength. In the weakly correlated regime the Coulomb interaction strength\nis small and the addition energy oscillates with N while, in the strongly correlated regime, the Coulomb\ninteraction dominates and EA varies smoothly with N .\nc\u00a9 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

With these parameters our\nbest value for E6 is only converged to \u2248 5% with\n2.9 \u00d7 105 Slater determinants in the expansion.\n3.1 Constant interaction model. In the weakly correlated regime, quantum dots are often analysed\nqualitatively with the constant interaction (CI) model [1]. In this model the Coulomb interaction energy is\nconstant, or slowly varying with N and, crucially, the single particle levels are assumed to fill up according\nto Hunds rule. The CI energy is then equal to EA(1), and the magnitude of the oscillations is related to the\nsingle particle level spacing. For example, in a quantum dot with harmonic confinement, EA(2)\u2212EA(1) =\n~\u03c9. In the Jarillo-Herrero device, the CI model constant interaction is large (\u2248 45 mev) compared to\n~\u03c9 \u2248 5 meV. From Fig. 1 it is clear that the CI model is unsatisfactory: the results of our full calculation\nwith parameters derived from the CI model do not reproduce the experimentally observed features. This is\nbecause the interaction is so large. The interaction significantly mixes the single particle states and hence\nthe assumption of simple, Hunds rule, shell filling breaks down.\n3.2 Comparison between harmonic and hard wall confinement. To obtain addition energies with\noscillations similar to those observed [1] we must increase the ratio of the single particle confinement\nenergy to the Coulomb interaction strength from the value obtained with the CI model (Fig. 1). The\nCoulomb interaction is scaled by the tube dielectric constant, \u000fr. The value of this constant is unknown\nbut, typically, 1 < \u000fr < 7 is assumed [5]. Here, we choose \u000fr = 6. Then, to obtain oscillations in\nEA(N) of approximately 5 meV we increase ~\u03c9 to 34.5 meV (Fig. 2). In this case the calculated EA(N)\nreproduces some of the features of the measured addition energy but decreases slightly too quickly with\nN . However, in the real system, the harmonic confinement is not constant but will increase with N . This is\nbecause, to put more electrons inside the dot, the back-gate potential must be raised and this will increase\nthe harmonic confinement. If the insulating layer between tube and back-gate is relatively small (< 50\nnm) the variation in harmonic confinement is significant and the rate at which EA decreases with N will\nbe much reduced.\nFrom Fig. 2 it is clear that the electrons in both the harmonically confined dot (~\u03c9 = 5.5 mev) and the\nhard wall dot are too strongly correlated. To drive the hard wall system into the weakly correlated regime\nand hence obtain oscillations in EA we need to reduce the dot width to less than 50 nm. With this type\nof confinement the dot width essentially controls the single particle level spacing and hence EA(N). The\nsingle particle level spacing is relatively insensitive to Vo. Instead Vo determines how many electrons will\nfit inside the dot. When L = 50 nm we need Vo > 1 eV to fit more than 5 electrons inside the dot.\nIn the strongly correlated limit the Coulomb interaction dominates, the electrons are forced as far apart\nas possible and tend to localise (Fig. 3). This electron localisation is, unsurprisingly, much more likely\nto occur with hard wall confinement when U(z) is flat inside the dot. When the Coulomb interaction\ndominates, the electrons form Wigner crystal-like states and we can show that the 2 electron ground state\nin a dot with weak harmonic confinement is well described by a molecular approximation [4]. For example,\nwith ~\u03c9 = 5.5 meV and \u000fr = 6 the molecular approximation is accurate to 2% for E2.\nc\u00a9 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim\n4 Mervyn Roy and P. A.

We have investigated the form of the confine-\nment potential in the NT dot and shown that, while some of the experimentally observed features in the\naddition energy may be reproduced with harmonic confinement, they cannot be explained if the quantum\ndot confinement is an abrupt potential step.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by EPSRC grant and was performed using the University of Le-\nicester Mathematical Modelling Centre\u2019s Supercomputer.\nReferences\n[1] P.
