Here, we present an investigation of the \nrelationships between two components of size (height and weight) and life history \noutcomes for men in a rural Gambian population. This population suffered seasonal \nfood shortages and high disease loads, and lacked access to medical care or \ncontraception. We find that there is no relationship between height and mortality \namong adult men. Tall men also do not have more children than shorter men, though \nthey do contract slightly more marriages than shorter men. Tall men, therefore, do not \nseem to have higher reproductive success in this Gambian population. Instead, weight \n(measured by BMI) appears to be a better predictor of life history outcomes, and \nultimately reproductive success, in this population. Heavier men have lower mortality \nrates, contract more marriages and have higher fertility than thinner men.  \n 4 \nIntroduction \nSize is an important component of life history analysis, as it is both a determinant and \nan outcome of life history decisions (Roff 1992; Stearns 1992). For example, adult \nsize is often the result of a trade-off between growth and reproduction \u2013 in many \nspecies growth ends when reproduction begins, so that individuals who start \nreproducing early end up as small adults (Allal et al. 2004; Stearns and Koella 1986). \nSize then determines demographic outcomes in adulthood, such as mortality and \nfertility. Larger individuals tend to have lower mortality and higher fertility rates \n(Gaillard et al. 1989; Harvey and Clutton-Brock 1985). Size has costs, however \n(Blanckenhorn 2000). If reproduction only begins when growth ends, individuals who \ngrow for long periods to become large adults may lose out to their competitors by \nstarting reproduction relatively late (and also risk dying before they can begin \nreproducing). Larger individuals also need greater energy intakes to maintain their \nlarge bodies, requiring greater time spent in food acquisition. The aim of this paper is \nto explore the effects of size on life history outcomes, and ultimately reproductive \nsuccess, in a population of Gambian men. \n \nSize can be measured in more than one way. A simple measure might be the overall \nweight of an individual. However, in capital breeders (species which store energy for \nreproduction) such as Homo sapiens, weight confounds two variables. It is a \ncomposite of both stature (or the size of the skeleton) and body composition \n(individuals with both more stored fat and greater lean tissue will be heavier than \nthose with less). Both overall stature and body composition are likely to have an \nimpact on life history variables. Stature is an indicator of chronic energy availability \u2013 \nindividuals who experienced low energy availability throughout their growth period \n 5 \nwill become smaller adults than those who had greater resource access during growth \n(Silventoinen 2003). But it is also correlated with life history outcomes for reasons \nunrelated to energy availability. For example, in many species, overall size affects \nmortality risk because smaller individuals are more at risk of predation than larger, \nhence providing one explanation for the correlation between size and mortality risk \n(Roff 1992). Body composition, on the hand, is a good indicator of the energy \navailable during adulthood itself. Individuals with low body mass will have relatively \nfew energetic reserves to devote both reproducing and maintaining body condition, \nand may have lower reproductive and higher mortality rates than those of greater \nbody mass (Glazier 2000). Additionally, males with greater lean tissue, and therefore \nmuscle mass, are likely to out-perform their weaker rivals in competition for mates. In \nour own species, these two components of size can be measured using height and \nBMI (body mass index, height\/weight2, a measure of fatness: Ferro-Luzzi et al. 1992).  \n \nPrevious research on humans has shown that height is linked with life history \noutcomes. Taller individuals tend to have lower mortality rates than shorter \nindividuals (Marmot et al. 1984; Waaler 1984), though the universality of this \nrelationship has recently been disputed (Samaras et al. 2003). Analysis of cause-\nspecific mortality suggests that taller individuals have lower mortality for some \ncauses of death, such as cardio-vascular disease, but for other causes of death, \nincluding several cancers, there is either a positive association between height and \nmortality or no correlation at all (Barker et al. 1990; Leon et al. 1995; Smith et al. \n2000; Song et al. 2003). Height has also been linked to marital and fertility outcomes \nin men. In Western populations, tall men have more marriages, are less likely to be \nchildless and have more children than shorter men (Mueller and Mazur 2001; Nettle \n 6 \n2002; Pawlowski et al. 2000), which ultimately leads to a positive correlation between \nheight and reproductive success.  \n \nA potential problem with a full understanding of the relationship between height and \nlife history outcomes is that much of the research cited above has been done in \nmodern Western populations (but see Costa 1993; Kemkes-Grottenthaler 2005; \nMurray 1997 for research on the height-mortality relationship in historical Western \npopulations). Given that the relationship between height and mortality appears to \ndepend on cause of death, and that the main causes of death are known to differ \nbetween environments, it is also possible that the height-mortality relationship may \ndiffer between the well-nourished West and populations living under greater \nenvironmental stress. The determinants of other life history outcomes, such as marital \nand fertility rates, also differ between environments. The little research done on height \nand fertility outcomes in non-Western populations suggests that ecology also needs to \nbe taken into account when investigating the link between height and reproduction. \nTall men, for example, have higher reproductive success, in terms of number of \nsurviving offspring, in a !Kung population and among a rural Bantu-speaking \npopulation in Namibia, but among urban Namibian Bantu-speakers shorter men have \nhigher reproductive success (Kirchengast 2000; Kirchengast and Winkler 1995).  \n \nPrevious research on weight and mortality has also shown clear evidence of a \ncorrelation. Thin individuals have been shown to be at high risk of death in both \ndeveloped and developing world populations (Engeland et al. 2003; Flegal et al. \n2005; Hosegood and Campbell 2003; Rissanen et al. 1991; Rotimi et al. 1999). \nHowever, over-weight individuals also seem to have higher mortality than those of \n 7 \nmedium weight (Ajani et al. 2004; Engeland et al. 2003; Murray 1997). Having few \nenergetic reserves to spend on maintaining body condition is risky, then, but there are \nphysiological costs to excess energy storage, so that the optimum weight may be \nmoderate, rather than excessive, fatness. \n \nWeight and fertility outcomes are less well studied, at least in men, but there is \nconsiderable indirect evidence that they are linked. Energetic resources correlate with \nreproductive endocrine function in men both within and between populations \n(Bribiescas 1996; Bribiescas 2001), and this variation may affect male fertility. For \nexample, disease load (which will be correlated with energetic reserves \u2013 men with \ngreater energetic reserves have more energy available to devote to immune function) \nhas the potential to affect male fecundity. Fevers have been shown to negatively affect \nsperm production (McFalls and McFalls 1984), and may adversely affect other \nrequirements of successful reproduction, such as coital frequency. But weight does \nnot only measure relative fatness, it is also an indicator of lean tissue and muscle mass \n(Norgan, 1990; Della Bianca et al., 1994). More important than their effects on \nspermatogenesis and coital frequency may be the effect energetic reserves and disease \nburden have on investment in muscle tissue (Muehlenbein, 2006). Male reproductive \nsuccess is heavily dependent on attracting, competing for and keeping mates, which is \nlikely to be affected by muscle mass. Larger men with greater muscle mass have \nhigher physical work capacities and are more productive than smaller men (Ferro-\nLuzzi, 1985; Spurr, 1988), and may therefore be more attractive as mates. The \ndrawback of muscle tissue is that it is expensive to maintain, and men of higher body \nmass have greater energetic requirements than smaller men (see Della Bianca et al., \n1994 for evidence from this Gambian population). Men with high muscle mass might \n 8 \nthen suffer during periods of food shortage, so that muscularity might not be entirely \nbeneficial in the variable environment in which these Gambian men.  \n \nAims of this study \nMuch of the research looking at relationships between size (both height and weight) \nand life history variables such as mortality and reproductive outcomes has been \ncarried out on Western populations. While these populations are certainly not \nuniform, they do share some rather unusual demographic and anthropometric \ncharacteristics when compared to most human populations throughout our history. \nMortality and fertility rates are low, and individuals are relatively tall and fat (over-\nnutrition is now a more serious health problem than under-nutrition). The aim of this \nstudy is to examine the relationship between male height, weight and life history \nvariables in a rural Gambia population, which suffered seasonal food stress and where \nmedical care was absent. \n \nData \nThe data were collected from 4 villages in rural Gambia, largely by Ian A. McGregor, \na medical doctor funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC). McGregor \ncarried out a research programme in these villages between 1950 and 1980 \n(McGregor 1991; McGregor and Smith 1952). In 1974, another MRC-funded team, \nthe Dunn Nutrition Unit (DNU), also began research in the area. Data on births and \ndeaths have been collected systematically since 1950 for all villages. Anthropometric \ndata were collected by McGregor during surveys undertaken at least once a year \nbetween 1950 and 1980. McGregor also collected additional demographic information \nfrom villagers during these surveys, including details of marriages for 2 of the 4 \n 9 \nvillages. Little medical care or contraception were available during the first 25 years \nof the study, though some medical treatment was available when McGregor and other \nresearchers were present in the villages. During this period, the villages were \nagricultural, farming rice and millet as primary staples. The diet was essentially \nvegetarian. There were considerable seasonal and annual fluctuations in food \navailability and disease prevalence.  \n \nData are still being collected today at this field site, but in 1975 the DNU established \na permanent medical clinic in one of these villages (Keneba) leading to a dramatic \nchange in the demography of these villages (Weaver and Beckerleg 1993). Much of \nthe analysis that follows (except where otherwise stated) is confined to the period \nbetween 1950 and 1974. This restriction was used partly because of the dramatic \nchange in demography as a result of the medical clinic but also for reasons of data \navailability and quality. Systematic surveys of all villagers were no longer carried out \nafter 1980, and the focus of research shifted to women and children, so that relatively \nlittle information on adult men is available after this date. The quality of demographic \ndata is also considered somewhat more questionable after 1980. \n \nBetween 1950 and 1980, men in this population were relatively short and light, but \nthe majority were within the limits of BMI considered to be adequately nourished \naccording to international standards. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for all \nanthropometric and demographic variables used in this analysis. A mean adult height \nand BMI for each individual was calculated by taking the average of all \nmeasurements obtained from that individual after the age of 20 years (BMI fluctuates \nover time but the measurements taken from a single individual are highly correlated, \n 10 \nso that this average figure should be good indication of the individual\u2019s overall \ncondition). From these averages, mean height of men in this population was 168cm \n(about 5\u20196) and mean BMI 20.4. 86% of men had a BMI of between 18.5-24.9 \n(considered the cut-off points for adequate nutritional status); a small proportion were \nunderweight (13% had a BMI below 18.5) but very few were overweight (0.8% had a \nBMI of 25 or more) and none obese (with a BMI of 30 or more). Individuals tended to \nlose weight during the rainy season, when food shortages were combined with an \nincrease in agricultural workload and disease prevalence, but gained weight again \nduring the \u2018harvest\u2019 season (McGregor, 1976). The great majority of anthropometric \nmeasurements were taken during the harvest season, when villagers were more likely \nto be available because of their lighter work burden. \n \nMethods \nTo estimate the relationship between size and life history outcomes in men in this \npopulation, we first analysed the effects of both height and BMI on the probability of \ndeath during adulthood for men of all ages between 1950 and 1974. Then we \ninvestigated the impact of size on marital and fertility outcomes for those men nearing \nthe end of their reproductive lives (defined as having reached the age of at least 50) by \n1975, in order to determine whether size was related to variables correlated with \nreproductive success.  \n \nMortality of all adult men  \nThe effect of size on the probability of dying in adulthood (i.e. from the age of 21 \nyears) was analysed using discrete-time event history analysis (EHA). We used age \n21 to define adulthood as most men would have reached their final adult height by \n 11 \nthis age. Despite high child mortality in this population, men who survived childhood \ncould expect to live relatively long lives: the median age at death for those who \nsurvived to age 21 was 67 years (Table 1). EHA models the probability of an event, in \nthis case a death, happening over time. Such models have the two advantages of being \nable to deal with censored data, and can include time-varying covariates (Allison \n1984). Discrete-time models are used in this analysis as time to event (death) is \nrecorded in years, which are relatively large units of time. When such large time units \nare used, discrete-time models are more appropriate because of the difficulty \ncontinuous time models have dealing with \u2018ties\u2019 i.e. several events occurring in the \nsame time interval (Steele et al. 1996; Yamaguchi 1991). Individuals were both right-\ncensored (those without a known date of death were right-censored at the age they \nwere last known to be alive, and all individuals still alive were censored in 1975) and \nleft-censored (those who reached the age of 21 before 1950 were only included in the \nanalysis from the age they had reached in 1950).  \n \nHeight and BMI were entered into separate models to test for their effects on the \nprobability of death in adulthood. Models were run separately for height and BMI \nsince the two variables are not entirely independent (although in fact exploratory \nanalysis demonstrated that the substantive results are unchanged whether the size \nvariables are entered separately or simultaneously into statistical models). Non-linear \neffects of both measures of size were tested for by including quadratic terms, and by \ncalculating quartiles of each anthropometric measure and including dummy variables \nfor three of the four quartiles. EHA assumes proportional hazards: this assumption \nwas tested by including interactions between age and both size variables. These \ninteractions were not significant so were dropped from the final models. The models \n 12 \ncontrolled for birth cohort. Exploratory models also controlled for village of \nresidence, but village appeared to have little relationship to adult mortality risk so this \nvariable from dropped from the final models. \n \nBMI was included as a time-varying covariate. Few individuals were surveyed in \nevery year between 1950 and 1980, so a mean BMI measurement was calculated for \neach individual for 5-year age blocks (for the ages 21-24, 25-29, 30-34 etc, up to the \nage groups 70-74, 75 and over), assuming the individual had more than one \nmeasurement in the 5-year age block. These mean BMI measurements were then \nentered into the model as time-varying in 5-year age blocks. If no measurements were \ntaken in a particular age block, the mean of the 2 measurements in the immediately \nyounger and older age blocks was calculated and included in the model for the age \nblock with missing data. All measurements taken within 12 months of death were \nexcluded when calculating these 5-year means, to avoid a decline in body condition \nprior to death contaminating the results.  \n \nHeight is clearly less variable with age than BMI, though does show a decline in older \nadults. Height was therefore included as time-constant until the age of 49 years, and \ntime-varying for older individuals. A mean height was calculated for each individual \nusing all measurements collected between the ages of 21 and 49, and this \nmeasurement was included as the individual\u2019s height for ages under 50 years. From \nthe age of 50 onwards, height was included as a time-varying covariate. These time-\nvarying height measures were constructed using the same method as for BMI. \n \nMarital and reproductive outcomes of men 50+ \n 13 \nSample \nFor the marriage and fertility analyses, we restricted our analysis to a sub-sample of \nthe population: we only included men nearing the end of their reproductive lives (i.e. \nhad reached at least the age of 50 years) in 1975, and only men from the two villages \nwith marriage data1. Restricting the analysis only to older men was done for both \ntheoretical and practical reasons. Restricting the sample to men nearing the end of \ntheir reproductive lives gives the best indication of how size impacts on overall \nreproductive success in this population. This restriction also reduces the impact of \ndata limitations on the analysis. For example, we cannot use EHA to investigate \nmarital success for men of all ages as we have very few dates of marriage in our \ndataset, so that we are limited to investigating the impact of size on the total number \nof marriages contracted. Including men of all ages in this analysis would introduce \nconfounds due to censoring. In addition, the great majority of the children fathered by \nolder men would have been produced before 1975 when demographic data collection \nwas reasonably accurate, and before the medical clinic had a substantial impact on \nmortality and fertility rates (in this population only 17% of children were born to \nfathers of 50 or older). The fertility analyses were restricted to the sub-sample of men \nfrom the two villages with marriage data partly because the fertility information was \nthought to be more complete for these villages but also because the final regression \nmodel in this section includes number of marriages as a covariate. Restricting all \nanalyses to men from the two villages with marriage data therefore means that the \nresults of all regression models in this section can be directly compared. \n \n                                                 \n1\n We have, in fact, run all the fertility analyses described here on samples using men from all villages \nand of all ages, and the results are very similar to those obtained from analyses using only the sample \ndescribed here \n 14 \nAlmost all men in this sample were reported to have been married at least once: only \n2% had no recorded marriages (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics on marriage and \nfertility). No analysis was therefore performed on the likelihood of marriage. There \nwas much more variation in the number of marriages men contracted, both because \nthis is a highly polygynous society, and because divorce was not uncommon. Of this \nsample, 86% had been married more than once (not necessarily polygynously), and \n62% had had more than 2 wives. The average number of marriages was 3.27 (note \nthis is the average total number of marriages, rather than current number of wives). \nChildlessness was also relatively uncommon in this sample: only 5% of these men \nhad no recorded children. The average number of children born was 9.35, of whom \n5.14 survived to age 14. For those men who did have children the average age at first \nbirth was 34 years. \n \nAnalysis \nTo investigate the impact of size on male marital and reproductive outcomes, we \nperformed 5 separate linear regression analyses. The dependent variables are listed \nbelow for each model: \n1. Model 1: number of marriages contracted \n2. Model 2: age at first birth \n3. Model 3: total number of children born \n4. Model 4: number of children surviving to age 14 \n5. Model 5: number of children surviving to age 14 (controlling for number of \nmarriages) \n \n 15 \nEach model was run twice: the first time to test for an effect of height; the second to \ntest for an effect of BMI. Again, models were run separately for height and BMI since \nthese two variables are not entirely independent (but again the results were similar if \nheight and BMI were entered into the same models). The height and BMI \nmeasurements included in these models were average measurements. For each man, \nan average height and an average BMI was calculated from all measurements taken \nafter the age of 20. Though BMI (and, to a lesser extent, height) clearly changes over \ntime, repeated measurements from each individual are highly correlated. These \naverage measurements were thought to adequately capture an individual\u2019s size. \nAdditional models were run controlling for the average age at which an individual\u2019s \nmeasurements were taken, and the number of times an individual had been measured, \nin case biases might be introduced due to age at, or frequency of, measurement. These \ncontrols made no difference to the results, so were not included in the final models. \nAs with the mortality analysis, exploratory models were run to test for non-linear \neffects of both height and BMI. \n  \nIn all 5 analyses, the man\u2019s age at death or censoring was included as a covariate to \ncontrol for the fact that not all men will have completed reproduction by the age of \n50. Any man without a known date of death was censored at the date when they were \nlast known to be alive. Age was estimated for individuals born before 1950 based on \nboth physical characteristics, and social age group (all individuals belong to kafos \u2013 \ngroups of individuals of similar age \u2013 and age-ranking of each kafo is known). Some \nmen in this sample will have begun reproducing before 1950 when systematic data \ncollection began. McGregor attempted to reconstruct the fertility and marriage \nhistories of men before 1950, but it is likely that data are less complete for events that \n 16 \noccurred before 1950 than those that occurred after the demographic surveillance \nsystem had been set up. Birth cohort is also controlled for in all models to reduce the \neffects of this potential bias. There were some differences in marriage and fertility \noutcomes between the villages in this study (Billewicz and McGregor 1981), so a \ncontrol for village was also included in all models. \n \nModels 1-4 therefore included identical independent variables (either height or BMI, \nvillage, birth cohort and age at death or censoring) but each had a different dependent \nvariable. Model 1 aimed to test the effect of size on the number of marriages \ncontracted. Models 2 to 4 aimed to test for an effect of size on age at first birth, total \nnumber of children born and number of children surviving to age 14. The last \noutcome is considered to be the closest proxy of reproductive success. Model 5 aimed \nto test for an effect of size on reproductive success, but controlling for the number of \nmarriages each man had contracted. Size can potentially affect male reproductive \nsuccess in two ways: either by affecting the number of marriages a man can contract \nor by directly affecting fertility outcomes. Model 5 was used to determine whether \nthere was an additional effect of size on fertility, even when controlling for the \nnumber of marriages.  \n \nResults \nMortality of all adult men  \nTable 2 shows the results for both event-history models of the probability of dying: \none testing for an effect of height and one testing for BMI (control variables are not \nshown in either Table 2 or Table 3 for clarity). There was no relationship between \nmale height and the probability of death in adulthood, regardless of whether height \n 17 \nwas modelled as a linear or non-linear function. BMI was significantly correlated with \nthe probability of death. The relationship between BMI and mortality was not linear, \nas the best fitting model included terms for both BMI and BMI squared. Visual \ninspection of this relationship indicates that under-nutrition is a more serious risk to \nmen\u2019s survival chances than over-nutrition. Figure 1 shows the model predictions of \nthe probability of dying across the observed range of BMI in this population. \nMortality risk did start to rise in men considered overweight by international \nstandards (i.e. had a BMI of 25 or more), but there were very few overweight men in \nthis population. Men at the very bottom of the BMI distribution (BMI of 13) showed \nmuch higher risks of death per year than those at the very top of the observed BMI \ndistribution (BMI of 29).  \n \nMarital and reproductive outcomes of men 50+ \nMarriage \nFigures 2a and 2b show scatterplots of number of marriages contracted against height \nand BMI respectively, and include the fitted univariate linear regression lines. These \nplots suggest that both size variables are positively correlated with the number of \nmarriages contracted. The results of the regression models displayed in Table 3 \nconfirm this. Table 3 shows the parameter estimates, standard errors and significance \nlevels for the height and BMI variables in each of the 5 regression models run on \nmarriage and fertility outcomes (control variables are excluded from the table for \nclarity). The results of Model 1 show that both height and BMI are significantly and \npositively related to the number of marriages men contracted, so that taller and \nheavier men had more wives than shorter and lighter men. Both relationships appear \n 18 \nto be linear as including non-linear functions for either height or BMI did not improve \nthe fit of the models.   \n \nFertility \nFigures 3a and 3b show scatterplots of reproductive success (number of children \nsurviving to age 14) against height and BMI respectively, and also show the fitted \nunivariate regression lines. These figures suggest that height is not significantly \nrelated to the number of surviving children, but that BMI is significantly and \npositively correlated with this outcome. The results of the linear regression analyses \nshown in Table 3 confirm this. Models 2-5 show that height was not significantly \nrelated to any of the fertility measures, though the results of all models were in the \nexpected direction (i.e. taller men had a lower age at first birth, more children and \nmore surviving children). Including non-linear terms for height did not result in \nsignificant correlations between height and any fertility outcome. BMI was, however, \nsignificantly related to all fertility outcomes: heavier men had more children, more \nsurviving children and a lower age at first birth. Model 5 investigated the effect of \nsize on number of children surviving to age 14, controlling for the number of \nmarriages contracted. The results of this model suggest that BMI remains significantly \ncorrelated with number of surviving children, even when controlling for number of \nmarriages, though the size of the parameter estimate is reduced slightly. As expected, \nnumber of marriages was also significantly positively related to the number of \nsurviving children (the parameter estimate for number of marriages in the regression \nmodel which included BMI as the size covariate was 0.75, SE=0.17 , p < 0.001). \nAgain, including non-linear terms for BMI did not improve the fit of the models.   \n \n 19 \nDiscussion \nIn the Gambia, male height was not correlated with either mortality or fertility \noutcomes, though tall men did contract slightly more marriages than shorter men. \nWeight instead appears to be a better predictor of reproductive success, as men with \nhigher BMIs had lower mortality rates and both more marriages and more children \n(note that very few men in this population were overweight, so that heavier men were \nthose within the range considered a healthy weight, rather than over-nourished men). \nThere was some indication that the relationship between BMI and mortality was \ncurvilinear in that, though under-nourished men had the highest mortality rates, men \nat the top of the BMI distribution also appeared to have slightly higher mortality than \nthose of average BMI. Few men were at the upper end of the BMI distribution, \nhowever, so that the detrimental consequences of low weight were likely to be of \nmore functional significance. The relationships between BMI and both marriage and \nfertility were linear.  \n \nThese results contrast somewhat with research done on Western populations. In the \nWest, taller men have higher reproductive success than shorter men, apparently \nbecause of their greater success on the marriage market. Though there was a small \npositive correlation between height and number of marriages in this Gambian \npopulation, there is little other evidence that height matters to either men or women \non the marriage market. In Western populations there is frequently positive assortative \nmating for height, so that taller men marry taller women (McManus and Mascie-\nTaylor 1984; Sanchez-Andres and Mesa 1994). There is also a strong \u2018male-taller\u2019 \nnorm: marriages in which the husband is shorter than the wife are rare (Gillis and \nAvis 1980). Both observations are indications that height matters when Western \n 20 \nindividuals are choosing a mate. There is no such evidence for either assortative \nmating for height or a male-taller norm in this Gambian population, suggesting height \nis not an important factor on the marriage market (Sear et al. 2004).  \n \nThis lack of evidence for strong mate preferences for height in the Gambia suggests \nthe small positive correlation between height and number of marriages may be \nbrought about by factors other than female choice for tall men. Taller men may be \nwealthier in this population, and thus able to afford more wives. Regardless of the \nmechanism for this relationship, it is rather puzzling that the positive relationship \nbetween number of marriages and height does not translate into higher reproductive \nsuccess for tall men (since number of wives is a significant predictor of reproductive \nsuccess for men in this population). Though the relationships between height and \nnumber of marriages and between number of marriages and reproductive success are \nstatistically significant, the r2 values suggest the proportion of variance explained in \neach model is rather small (r2 = .10 for the regression on number of marriages \nincluding height as a covariate; r2 = .20 for the regression on number of children \nsurviving to 14 including both height and number of marriages). Given that marriages \nare rather unstable in this society, and that a relatively high proportion of marriages \ndid not produce children (~30% of marriages were childless), the number of \nmarriages may not necessarily be a very strong predictor of reproductive success for \nmen in this population. Further exploration of this dataset suggests that taller men \nmay have been more likely to have childless marriages than shorter men (results not \nshown). The reasons for this are unclear, but may provide an explanation for the lack \nof an association between height and reproductive success, despite a positive \ncorrelation between height and number of marriages. \n 21 \n \nEven if we set aside the issue of marriage, the lack of a relationship between male \nheight and reproductive success is perhaps surprising. We might have expected to see \na positive correlation between height and both survival and reproduction in a food-\nstressed population such as this because tall height should correlate with relatively \ngood environmental conditions in childhood. Good conditions in childhood should \ncorrelate with positive demographic outcomes in later life both because a good \nenvironment in childhood may well be correlated with similarly good conditions in \nadulthood, and because poor conditions in childhood can result in physiological \nchanges which result in poor health and higher mortality in adulthood (Barker 1994; \nGluckman et al. 2007). But human populations vary considerably in their overall level \nand variability of energy availability, disease load, prominent causes of death and \nspeed of growth: all factors which may affect the height-mortality relationship. Speed \nof growth, for example, may be important because laboratory studies on rodents have \nsuggested there may be costs to fast growth in that calorie restricted animals have \nslower growth but extended lifespans (Rollo, 2002). In this Gambian case, variability \nof energy availability may be important. In this variable environment, food resources, \nenergetic expenditure and disease load all vary both seasonally and annually. Since \nlarger individuals have higher energetic requirements, tall men may suffer during \nperiods of food shortage because of their higher energetic requirements, cancelling \nout any health advantages that taller men might have. The other limited evidence from \nnon-Western modern populations does indicate that there may be some variation \nbetween populations in the relationship between height and mortality. While some \nhistorical or developing country populations show a negative relationship between \nheight and mortality risk (e.g. Costa 1993; Kemkes-Grottenthaler 2005), some show \n 22 \nno relationship (Hosegood and Campbell 2003; Murray 1997), or a U-shaped \nrelationship (for women in this Gambian population: Sear et al., 2004). More \ninformation on the height-mortality relationship is needed across a range of \npopulations so that a systematic analysis of the causes of this variation can be \nconducted.  \n \nIn contrast to the height-mortality relationship, the association between BMI and \nmortality in Gambian men is more similar to that seen in the West: individuals of both \nlow and high BMI have higher mortality rates than those of adequate BMI. Though \nthis relationship is curvilinear in most populations, there has been some debate about \nwhat is the optimal BMI in terms of mortality risk. A few recent Western studies have \nshown that overweight individuals (i.e. those with a BMI of 25-29) may not have an \nincreased mortality risk compared to those of adequate weight, and that only obesity \n(BMI>29) increases mortality risk (Flegal et al. 2005; Laara and Rantakallio 1996). \nThis has led some authors to argue that the detrimental effects of over-weight are \ndecreasing over time, perhaps because of improved health care (Flegal et al. 2005; \nHenderson 2005). That we see an increase in mortality risk for Gambian individuals \nwho have a BMI of only around 24 or 25 is consistent with this argument. Relatively \nfew Gambian men have such high BMIs, however. Of more relevance to this \npopulation is the detrimental effect of under-weight. \n \nWhat BMI is measuring may also differ between environments. In the well-nourished \nindustrial world, BMI is an indicator of fatness. In leaner populations, while BMI may \nalso provide an indicator of fatness or energy reserves, differences in BMI at the \nlower end of the scale may reflect differences in lean tissue as well as fat reserves \n 23 \n(Norgan, 1990; Norgan, 1994; Shetty and James, 1994). The high mortality rates of \nmen at the very bottom of the BMI distribution may result from the detrimental \nconsequences not just of a lack of energetic reserves, but a lack of lean tissue as well. \nThe slight increase in mortality risks to the heaviest men indicates that high body \nweight also has costs in this environment. As with tall men, the heaviest men in this \npopulation may also suffer during periods of food scarcity because of their higher \nenergetic requirements.  \n \nThe relationship between nutritional status and fertility is, to our knowledge, \nrelatively little studied in men, although at least one previous study has found a \nsimilar positive relationship between BMI and fertility to that seen here (Kirchengast \n2000). Such a positive relationship is to be expected, as nutritional status is likely to \nbe correlated with both wealth and health, and therefore with marital prospects. \nWealthy men will be able to afford more wives. Healthier men may also be more \nattractive as marriage partners to women (see Kurzban and Weeden, 2005 for an \nexample that weight matters, at least when American women are choosing a partner). \nThis analysis confirms that heavier men in the Gambia do have more wives than \nlighter men. This analysis also suggests that the BMI-fertility relationship may not be \nentirely mediated by number of wives, however, as even controlling for the number of \nmarriages there is still a significant relationship between BMI and fertility outcomes. \nThis provides evidence that there may be a direct link between BMI and male fertility, \nthrough the influence of energetic status on male physiology. An alternative (though \nnot necessarily mutually exclusive) explanation is that there is an indirect link, if \nhealthier men are married to healthier women, and healthier women have higher \nfertility.  \n 24 \n \nConclusion \nIn summary, this paper suggests that there is no association between male height and \nreproductive success in a rural Gambian population. Here, weight (BMI) is a better \npredictor of life history outcomes than height: heavier men have lower mortality, \nmore marriages and higher fertility than lighter men, ultimately leading to higher \nreproductive success. Though the number of marriages men contract is a significant \npredictor of reproductive success, the relationship between BMI and reproductive \nsuccess is not entirely mediated by the greater number of wives heavier men acquire. \nThis suggests there may be a direct link between energetic availability and fertility in \nmen. Given that there is clearly variation between populations in the relationship \nbetween size and life history variables, we suggest further research needs to be \nundertaken to explore these relationships across a variety of populations, in concert \nwith further work on the mechanisms which underlie these relationships.  \n  \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to the many helpful comments from delegates at the IUSSP Seminar on the \nEcology of the Male Life Course, Rauischholzhausen, October 2006.\n 25 \nReferences  \nAjani U.A., P.A.
