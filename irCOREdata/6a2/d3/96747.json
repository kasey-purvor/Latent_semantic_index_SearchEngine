INTRODUCTION\nThe origin of pigmentation patterns on animal coats has\ncertainly raised questions in every curious mind. In his story\n\u201cHow the leopard got his spots\u201d \u00031\u0004, Kipling was not trying\nto give the question a scientific answer. He did not mean to\nbe serious about Darwinism either when he said the zebra got\nhis stripes pattern by standing long in the checked shadow.\nThe law of natural selection might have already answered the\nwhy question, but to many scientists, an answer, which mod-\nern genetics obviously can not offer, to the how question\nwould be more meaningful. One possible mechanism to ex-\nplain how animals get their coat patterns was proposed by\nTuring \u00032\u0004 in 1952. By assuming there are two kinds of mor-\nphogens diffusing on a surface and interacting with each\nother, he showed that the distributions of the morphogens\nwould form spatial patterns. In 1972, Gierer and Meinhardt\n\u00033\u0004, with the help of a computer, successfully generated spa-\ntial patterns of anatomical structures in hydra using the Tur-\ning model and showed that the model was consistent with the\nresults of a number of regeneration and implantation experi-\nments. Since then many Turing-type models described by\ncoupled systems of reaction-diffusion equations have been\nused for generating patterns in mammals \u00034,5\u0004, fish \u00035\u20138\u0004,\nladybugs \u00039\u0004, bacterial colonies \u000310\u201312\u0004, phyllotaxis \u000313,14\u0004,\nand many others. The text book Mathematical Biology \u000315\u0004\nwritten by Murray contains many such examples, as well as\nanalysis techniques for and properties of Turing models.\nOne caveat is in order. People used Turing models be-\ncause these models are powerful in generating patterns, not\nbecause there is, as yet, uncontroversial evidence that pat-\nterns in biology arise as a result of a Turing reaction-\ndiffusion process. However, evidence of morphogens\u2014the\nessential ingredients of the Turing models\u2014has emerged re-\ncently \u000316\u0004, and Turing structures were discovered in chem-\nistry some 15 years ago \u000317,18\u0004. Thus, soon the study of the\nTuring model and its application to biological systems may\nnot simply be of academic interest.\nAmongst the myriad of pigment patterns exhibited in the\nanimal kingdom, the spotted pattern of the leopard holds a\ncertain fascination. The \u201cspotted\u201d pattern of the leopard is\nactually more precisely a rosette pattern. Even without the\nhelp of the charming fable \u00031\u0004, it still attracts researchers\n\u000319\u201322\u0004 because it offers an optimal level of challenge for\ngenerating it. The same may be said for the patterns on the\njaguar, which appear too complicated to be generated by a\nstraightforward application of a Turing model.\nThe pigmentation patterns on leopards and jaguars change\nas they grow. In Figs. 1 and 2 we show pictures of a leopard\nand a jaguar, respectively, in three stages of development\nwith distinct coat patterns \u000323\u0004. Broadly speaking, the mark-\nings change from spots to rosettes. This pattern transforma-\ntion is consistent with the results of a recent phylogenetic\nanalysis \u000324\u0004. In light of this, we construct a model in which\nwe propose two stages of patterning. In the first stage, spots\nare generated in a similar manner for both the leopard and\nthe jaguar. In the second stage, we tune model parameters to\ngenerate, separately, the patterns of the adult animal. We\nshow that, in this way, the temporal sequence of patterns\nshown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 can be produced by our model.\nII. A TWO-STAGE MODEL\nWe use the simple reaction-diffusion model adopted by\nBarrio et al. \u000325\u0004 which is essentially transformed so that it\nhas a steady state at \u00010,0\u0002, that is, the variables should be\nviewed as deviations from a steady state, rather than actual\nconcentrations. The model has very simple nonlinear inter-\naction terms: quadratic and cubic interactions between two\nmorphogens u and v:\n\u0001u\n\u0001t\n= D\u0003\u00022u + \u0004u + v \u2212 r2uv \u2212 \u0004r3uv2,\n\u0001v\n\u0001t\n= \u0003\u00022v + \u0005u + \u0006v + r2uv + \u0004r3uv\n2\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere D is the ratio of the diffusion coefficient of the acti-\nvator u to that of the inhibitor v, and \u0003 is a scaling variable\nwhich can be viewed either as the relative strength of the\ndiffusion compared to the interaction terms, or as a measure\nof the length scale in the problem. It is known that D has to\nbe smaller than one to obtain spatially nonuniform stable\npatterns. The quadratic and cubic interaction terms favor pat-\nterns of spots and stripes, respectively \u000325\u201327\u0004. We consider\nthe above problem on the spatial domain of a square and\nimpose zero flux boundary conditions. Without diffusion, the\nsystem has two stable uniform solutions. By taking \u0005=\u2212\u0004,\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 011914 \u00012006\u0002\n1539-3755\/2006\/74\u00011\u0002\/011914\u00018\u0002 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society011914-1\nthe two solutions degenerate to be simply the one \u0001u ,v\u0002\n= \u00010,0\u0002 at all points in space considered.\nStandard linear analysis \u000315\u0004 can be carried out to guide\nthe choice of parameter values D, \u0003, \u0004, \u0006, r2, and r3, so that\nthe model exhibits \u201cdiffusion driven\u201d \u0001or Turing\u0002 instability,\nthat is, the uniform steady state is stable in the absence of\ndiffusion but becomes unstable when diffusion is present. In\nthe case of this model, the linearization is trivial since one\nsimply ignores the higher order terms in Eqs. \u00011\u0002. As usual,\nwe assume that the morphogen concentrations u and v take\nthe form\nu\u0001x\u0001,t\u0002 \u0005 u0e\u0007teik\n\u0001\n\u00b7x\u0001\n,\nv\u0001x\u0001,t\u0002 \u0005 v0e\u0007teik\n\u0001\n\u00b7x\u0001\n. \u00012\u0002\nImposing the zero-flux condition on the boundary \u0001which\nmeans that morphogens do not flow out of the region con-\nsidered\u0002, results in solutions with the form Eq. \u00012\u0002 only being\nadmissible for a set of discrete values of k, which are called\nadmissible modes. The temporal growth rate \u0007 can easily be\nfound as a function of the possible modes indicated by k, by\nsubstituting the above solution into the linearized version of\nEq. \u00011\u0002 yielding a dispersion relation from which one can\nchoose parameters to allow only a small number of modes to\ngrow in time \u0003Re\u0001\u0007\u0002\b0, so that the diffusion-driven insta-\nbility leads to patterns\u0004 and, in particular, to enhance any\nparticular mode \u000325,28\u0004. We use the following set of values\nfor parameters to generate a stable spotted pattern on a\nsquare of 200\t200 points shown in Fig. 3. The initial values\nof u and v at each point are assigned randomly between 0\nand 1.\nD = 0.45, \u0003 = 6, \u0004 = 0.899, \u0006 = \u2212 0.91, r2 = 2,\nr3 = 3.5. \u00013\u0002\nWith this set of parameters, the mode with k=0.27 is en-\nhanced most and this corresponds to the spot pattern \u0001Fig. 3\u0002.\nThis is stage 1. We now use this as our initial distributions\nfor u and v to generate, in stage 2, the patterns in the adult.\nThe use of a spotted pattern for our initial distributions of u\nand v is based on the recent report of Werdelin and Olsson\n\u000324\u0004. They found, regardless of which of several different\nphylogenies of felids is used, that flecks \u0001small spots not\norganized into patterns\u0002 are the primitive pattern of the felid\nfamily. All other patterns, including rosettes \u0001small spots or-\nganized into patterns of six or fewer spots\u0002 and blotches \u0001ir-\nregularly shaped areas of dark on a usually lighter back-\nground\u0002, develop from it. We see from Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 \u000323\u0004\nthat the patterns on leopards and jaguars are indeed spots\n\u0001flecks\u0002 in the young, which then gradually transform into,\nrespectively, rosettes and blotches in the adult \u000329\u0004. Pigmen-\ntation pattern alteration during growth is observed in a num-\nber of animals \u00036,30\u0004. For example, Asai et al. have used a\nTuring reaction-diffusion model to simulate the skin pigmen-\ntation patterns of the zebrafish in various stages of growth by\nchanging parameters with time \u000330\u0004. Aragon et al. have also\nused a particular pattern as a seed for generating spatial pat-\ntern in sea urchins \u000328\u0004.\nIII. PARAMETER SELECTION DURING GROWTH\nWe start with the parameter values given in Eq. \u00013\u0002 and\nobtain the spotted pattern shown in Fig. 3. We then, in the\nFIG. 1.

As stated\nabove, the quadratic term in Eq. \u00011\u0002 favors spots. Increasing\nthe value of r2 will enhance the density of spots and increase\nthe spatial gradients of morphogen concentration profiles.\nThe initial spots in Fig. 3 grow darker and begin to change\ninto rings \u0003Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002\u0004. We next make changes to D and \u0003. At\nthis point, let us discuss the effects of parameter D and \u0003.\nA general linear analysis \u000315,28\u0004 shows that the necessary\nconditions for yielding Turing patterns are given by\nfu + gv\n 0,\nfugv \u2212 fvgu\b 0,\nDgv \u2212 fu\b 0,\n\u0001Dgv \u2212 fu\u00022 \u2212 4D\u0001fugv \u2212 fvgu\u0002\b 0, \u00014\u0002\nwhere fu, fv \u0001gu ,gv\u0002 denote the partial derivatives of f\u0001g\u0002\nwith respect to u and v. Based on these conditions we plot\nthe \u0001\u0004 ,\u0006\u0002 parameter space to show the Turing space\u2014the\nregion in which Turing patterns are predicted to occur from\nthe linear stability analysis \u0001Fig. 5\u0002. Our choice of \u0001\u0004 ,\u0006\u0002 is\nindicated in Fig. 5.\nThe dispersion relation \u0007\u0001k\u0002 can be found \u000328\u0004 from the\ncharacteristic equation:\n\u00072 + \u0003\u00011 + D\u0002\u0003k2 \u2212 \u0004 \u2212 \u0006\u0004\u0007 + D\u00032k4 \u2212 \u0003\u0001\u0004 + D\u0006\u0002k2\n+ \u0004\u0001\u0006 + 1\u0002 = 0. \u00015\u0002\nTo see the effects of the parameters D and \u0003, we plot in Fig.\n6 the dispersion relation corresponding to several values of\none parameter while keeping the others fixed. We see in gen-\neral that the available Turing modes \u0003Re\u0001\u0007\u0002\b0\u0004 shift to\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Coat patterns of a jaguar at different stages of growth: \u0001a\u0002 spots \u00015 weeks\u0002, \u0001b\u0002 irregular rings \u00013 months\u0002, \u0001c\u0002 small\nspots enclosed by irregular broken polygons \u0001adult\u0002.\nTWO-STAGE TURING MODEL FOR GENERATING\u00bc PHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 011914 \u00012006\u0002\n011914-3\nhigher wave numbers \u0001larger k\u0002 when \u0003 is decreased \u0001see, for\nexample Ref. \u000315\u0004\u0002. The minimal value of wave number k\nthat can support the Turing pattern can be easily found to be\ninversely proportional to the square root of \u0003 \u000328\u0004. On the\nother hand, when D is decreased, the available Turing modes\nincrease, and all available modes are enhanced further \u0001\u0007\ngets larger\u0002.\nWith this understanding, for the leopard pattern, we force\nthe system to switch to a higher wave number mode by de-\ncreasing \u0003 from 6 to 3.8. We immediately see a few rings\nbegin to break. The breaking process continues until we\nchange the value of D to a lower value D=0.15 to stabilize\nthe pattern \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004 \u000331\u0004. For the jaguar pattern, similar\nsteps are taken: increase r2 first, and then decrease \u0003, and\nfinally decrease D. There are two different settings from the\ncase of the leopard. We increase r2 from 2 to 7 and keep it\nfixed at that value for a longer time than in case of the leop-\nard so that the rings become larger and compress one another\nto form hexagonal shapes. Note also that an inner ring begins\nto appear so that every ring changes to a double ring \u0003Fig.\n7\u0001a\u0002\u0004. In the second step, we decrease \u0003 to 1.8, which is\nlower than the value 3.8 in the leopard case, to \u201cbreak\u201d\nmodes. Thus the enhanced mode shifts to one with a higher\nwave number according to the dispersion relation shown in\nFig. 8. The inner ring breaks first. When the inner rings are\nbroken completely and some outer rings begin to break, we\ndecrease D \u0001to 0.15\u0002 to stabilize the final pattern \u0003Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002\u0004\n\u000331\u0004.\nIV. COMPARISON WITH REAL PATTERNS\nCoat patterns of a typical leopard at three stages of growth\nare shown in Fig. 1 \u000323\u0004. Roughly speaking, the pattern\ngrows from spots to rings and then to rosettes. Our simula-\ntion aims to follow this temporal sequence and indeed it\nsuccessfully generates the sequence of patterns \u0003Fig. 3, Figs.\n4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004. Previous simulations using a one-stage Turing\nmodel \u000319,20,22\u0004 might have produced final rosette patterns\nsimilar to the patterns of real leopards, but they left the pro-\ncess of the sequential development of pattern unanswered.\nOur results for the pigment patterns of the jaguar \u0003Fig. 3,\nFigs. 7\u0001a\u0002 and 7\u0001b\u0002\u0004 compare well with those actually ob-\nserved \u0001Fig. 2\u0002. The patterns in the adult \u0001small spots en-\nclosed by irregular broken polygons\u0002 are particularly difficult\nto generate using a one-stage Turing model. Even if it is\npossible, it still fails to explain the temporal series of patterns\nobserved during the growth of the animal. Our model sug-\ngests that it would be easier to obtain a complicated pattern\nin steps, and at the same time, one can capture key aspects of\nthe temporal development.\nNote that our simulations are consistent with the fact that\nthe number of rosettes or patches on the adult leopard or\njaguar is roughly the same with the number of spots on\nyounger animals. This is different from the case of angelfish\nwhere the number of stripes increases as the fish grows \u00036\u0004.\nFIG. 3. Spot pattern generated by the Turing model Eq. \u00011\u0002.\nParameters are D=0.45, \u0003=6, \u0004=0.899, \u0006=\u22120.91, r2=2, r3=3.5.\nThe pattern is used as the initial distributions for the morphogens u\nand v in the second stage of the model.\nFIG. 4. Simulated patterns corresponding to the case of the leop-\nard in the second stage. Starting from the spot pattern \u0001Fig. 3\u0002, we\nincrease r2 from 2 to 7 to obtain \u0001a\u0002, and then decrease \u0003 from 6 to\n3.8 to obtain \u0001b\u0002, which is then stabilized by decreasing D from 0.45\nto 0.15.\nLIU, LIAW, AND MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 011914 \u00012006\u0002\n011914-4\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe choice of the parameters for producing patterns in\ndifferent steps for either the leopard or jaguar is not unique.\nThere are wide ranges of values of the parameters that we\ncan use to obtain spotted patterns, and any of which can, in\nprinciple, be used as initial distributions to generate patterns\nof the adult leopard and jaguar as long as the subsequent\nvariations can be adjusted accordingly. For example, two\nother choices for parameters \u0004 and \u0006 in the Turing space are\n\u00010.77,\u22120.91\u0002 and \u00010.77,\u22120.99\u0002 \u0001Fig. 5\u0002.

In general, robustness is difficult to ob-\ntain for global patterning mechanisms. The work of Dillon et\nal. \u000332\u0004 and Crampin et al. \u000333\u0004 has shown how modifying\nthe Turing system through controlling the boundary condi-\ntions or incorporating domain growth can greatly increase\nthe robustness of certain patterns. In the present study, the\ncrucial point for generating patterns of the felid family by a\nTuring model is by use of the two-stage growth process in\nwhich the spotted pattern is generated in the first stage. The\nfinal patterns are determined by suitable changes of param-\neters and the timing of their changes in the second stage. In\nparticular, the timing of the last decrease of parameter D\nplays an important role. In the case of jaguar, when \u0003 is\ndecreased, the inner rings normally break into four small\nspots and some of these spots gradually disappear. A timely\ndecrease of D produces our final pattern \u0003Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002\u0004. Due to\nthe complexity of the parameter space, it is formidable for\nthe present to map out all the possible ranges of parameters\nthat can yield desired patterns. Moreover, in the second stage\nprocess we are dealing with spatially dependent patterns and\nso to fully understand the effects of parameter values would\nrequire a stability analysis in a highly nonlinear regime. This\ncould only be done numerically. However, as we see below,\nthe general intuition we have gained on how a certain param-\neter affects the system in the linear regime seems to hold in\nthis much more complex situation.\nIn the second stage of the simulation, we change the pa-\nrameters r2, \u0003, and D sequentially from one value to another.\nAlthough we do not have precise evidence that parameters\nchange in the system, we are motivated to change the diffu-\nsion coefficient since it sets the overall scale of the system\nand this changes as the individual grows. Since the growth of\nan animal is a continuous process, the change of \u0003 is more\nlikely to change continuously as well. In view of this, we\nhave further adopted two continuous transition processes for\nparameters r2, \u0003, and D changing from one value to another.\nThe first is a linear function for the change of a parameter g\nfrom gi to gf \u000330\u0004:\ng\u0001t\u0002 = gi + c\u0001gf \u2212 gi\u0002 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere c is the changing rate of the parameter g during the\nchanging period. Another more smooth function at both ends\nof the changing period is given by the logistic growth func-\ntion:\ng\u0001t\u0002 =\ngf\n1 + e\u2212ct\u0001gf\/gi \u2212 1\u0002\n. \u00017\u0002\nAgain, the value of c governs the changing rate. We found\nthat it is possible to find a range of possible values of c for\neach parameter r2, \u0003, and D so that the results obtained in\nSec. III hold. Namely, we can obtain similar final patterns for\neither the leopard or the jaguar with those using sudden\nchanges of parameters. For example, for the case of jaguar\npattern Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002, we use Eq. \u00017\u0002 to change \u0003 from 6 to\napproach 1.8. A similar pattern to Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002 is obtained when\nthe changing rate c is greater than 1.0. We are currently\nworking on the details of these simulations and their analy-\nsis.\nTo gain some insights to the patterns, we compute the\npower spectra of the simulation patterns using the two-\ndimensional Fourier transform. In Fig. 9 we show our simu-\nlation patterns of the jaguar at four consecutive steps to-\ngether with their two-dimensional power spectra. We see\nFIG. 9. Simulation patterns of the jaguar at four sequential steps \u0001a\u0002\u2013\u0001d\u0002 and the corresponding spectra of two-dimensional Fourier\ntransform \u0001e\u0002\u2013\u0001h\u0002. The dimensions of the spatial pattern are 200\t200 pixels. Using pixel as the unit of length, the distance between two\nspots in patterns \u0001a\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002 is about 25 on average. Thus the first conspicuous frequency in the power spectrum is about 0.04 which appears\nin \u0001e\u0002 as the smallest white ring in the middle. The smallest white ring in \u0001g\u0002 has a radius of about 0.08. This can be understood since the\naverage distance between bands of the rings in \u0001c\u0002 is about one half of the distance between spots in \u0001a\u0002 or \u0001b\u0002. The frequency range is from\n0 \u0001center\u0002 to 0.5 \u0001edge\u0002 in \u0001e\u0002\u2013\u0001h\u0002. We have taken log values of the intensity to increase contrasts of the spectra \u0001e\u0002\u2013\u0001h\u0002.\nLIU, LIAW, AND MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 74, 011914 \u00012006\u0002\n011914-6\nthat, as the spatial patterns go from small spots to larger\nspots, then rings, and finally broken rings, the high frequency\nmodes \u0001white regimes with large radii to center\u0002 are gradu-\nally enhanced while the lowest conspicuous frequency mode\n\u0003the white ring with smallest radius in Fig. 9\u0001e\u0002\u0004 disappears\nat the third step \u0003Fig. 9\u0001g\u0002\u0004. It is even clearer from Fig. 10\nwhere we plot one-dimensional power spectra by taking in-\ntensity along the horizontal line through the center of every\ntwo-dimensional frequency domain in Fig. 9. In the first step,\nwhen the spatial pattern consists of spots, there is a peak at\nlow frequency 0.041 in the power spectrum. When the pa-\nrameter r2 is increased in the second step, this peak is en-\nhanced and some high frequency modes begin to appear. For\nthe rings pattern \u0003Fig. 9\u0001c\u0002\u0004, this low frequency peak disap-\npears, consistent with Fig. 6\u0001a\u0002 where we see the effect of\ndecreasing \u0003. The most enhanced frequency is now 0.081\nwhich is about two times the value for the case of the spot\npattern. This can be understood because the average distance\nbetween the bands of the rings is about one half of the dis-\ntance between spots. In our final pattern for the jaguar we\nhave some broken rings which means more high frequency\nmodes appear in the power spectrum.\nWe can directly see the relation between a spatial pattern\nand its frequency modes by comparing the result of the in-\nverse Fourier transformation of the truncated frequency do-\nmains with the original pattern. Take the pattern of the third\nstep shown in Fig. 9\u0001c\u0002 for example. Truncating the fre-\nquency at the value 0.061 \u0003Fig. 11\u0001a\u0002\u0004, the resultant pattern\n\u0003Fig. 11\u0001b\u0002\u0004 of the higher frequency part matches the original\npattern \u0003Fig. 9\u0001c\u0002\u0004 very closely, while that of lower frequency\npart \u0003Fig. 11\u0001c\u0002\u0004 can be hardly recognized to be related to the\noriginal pattern. On the other hand, the spot pattern \u0003Fig.\n9\u0001a\u0002\u0004 can be reproduced almost completely using a low-pass\nfilter.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA recent phylogenetic analysis showed that flecks are the\nprimitive pigmentation pattern of the felid family and all\nother patterns, including rosettes and blotches, develop from\nit. The development of the coat makings of the leopard and\njaguar is consistent with this result. Based on this result, we\ntook a simple Turing model and generated patterns at differ-\nent growth stages of the leopard and jaguar by tuning param-\neters of the model in steps. We first generated the spotted\npattern for the young leopard and jaguar. In the second stage,\nthree parameters were changed in sequence to enhance, to\nshift, and to stabilize spatial modes consistent with the\npattern transformation observed during the growth of the\nanimals. The rosette patterns on adult leopards were obtained\nin three steps, while the more complicated patterns on\nadult jaguars were obtained similarly with a different set of\nparameters.\nTuring models have been demonstrated previously in\nmany examples to generate patterns similar to those ob-\nserved in nature. However, few studies address the pattern\nchanges during growth. In this article we have successfully\nused a simple Turing model to generate the temporal evolu-\ntion of coat markings in the leopard and jaguar at different\nstages of growth by tuning the parameters of the model dur-\ning growth. It is not unreasonable to propose that parameters\nof the model would change during growth. Note that al-\nthough we have not explicitly included growth of the domain\nin this study, the parameter \u0003 is inversely related to domain\nscale, so we would expect that an increase in domain size\nwould correspond to a decrease in this parameter.\nIn conclusion, we have shown the ability of a Turing\nreaction-diffusion model to exhibit a temporal sequence\nof spatial patterning that is consistent with some examples\nin nature. This lends further support to the role of morpho-\ngens in developmental biology but of course does not prove\nFIG. 10.
