After all, we practically invented social class in England, where\nthe industrial proletariat was born. However, very shortly after arriving at the\nCenter for Working Class studies it became apparent that something rather dif-\nferent and exciting is currently happening to the study of social class and the\nworking-class in the United States. The conference included a truly impressive\ncollection of offerings from a wide variety of academic papers, through perfor-\nmance art and poetry readings to an inspirational session of readings from a new\nbook written and read by steelworkers; The Heat: Steelworker Lives and Leg-\nends, (Cedar Hill Publications, Arkansas, 2001). If you haven\u2019t read this book\nyet I would advise you to dash out and buy it now!\nThe wide variety of substantive material presented in the sessions included\nwork from within most of the disciplines within the humanities and social sci-\nences. The one thing that the overwhelming number of papers had in common\nwas their stress upon presenting and underlining the agency of working-class\npeople. Without in any way lapsing into romanticism, most accounts sought to\nportray aspects of working class life that are usually neglected within the acad-\nemy. The exciting thing about such work is that while remaining substantively\nfocused it becomes of necessity a simultaneous critique of the academy and\nwider society. In a climate in my own country where much that once stood as\ncritical theory has become staid, conformist, and elitist it is very refreshing to\nfind an area of work with a vibrancy and excitement that is reminiscent of the\nearly years of the feminist movement. A further parallel with that movement is\nthe controversies that rage over the theoretical frame that best fits the further\ndevelopment of the area. One such theme that ran across a number of sessions\nwas the relationship of working-class studies to Marxism. The case made elo-\nquently by Barbara Foley (Rutgers University) was well presented and sup-\nported by a minority of people, it argued that working-class studies can best be\naccommodated within a Marxist framework. A response to this position was pro-\nvided by, among others, Jack Metzgar (Roosevelt University) and Michael\nZweig (SUNY Stony Brook). They argued quite convincingly that while work-\ning-class studies needs to recognise the immense analytical value of some of the\nmain concepts of Marxism it is nevertheless the case that to merely reduce work-\ning class studies to Marxism would impose too much of a conceptual straight-\njacket. For Metzgar and Zweig the important thing about working-class studies\nInternational Labor and Working-Class History\nNo. 61, Spring 2002, pp. 177\u2013179\n\u00a9 2002 International Labor and Working-Class History, Inc.\nas it is presently being developed in the United States is that the approach to the\nworking class is a one that can unite conceptions of class as a relationship and as\nan identity in a way that is rather more creative than is captured in notions of\n\u201cclass in itself\u201d and \u201cclass for itself.\u201d Zweig, in particular, argued that there must\nbe space to study class as \u201clived experience;\u201d the agency of working-class peo-\nple must be recognized as a way of challenging the objectifying tendencies of\nmuch academic work, including some varieties of Marxism.\nThese themes were present in some of the other sessions although they\nwere often implicit within the substantive accounts rather than being highlight-\ned as a central theoretical object to be addressed. Thus the plenary session giv-\nen by Alessandro Portelli (University of Rome La Sapienza) was a lively advo-\ncacy of the potential of oral history techniques to represent the often-silenced\nvoices of working-class people. Such approaches not only \u201ctell the stories\u201d but\nthey also \u201cname the names.\u201d In the face of much academic practice that is ob-\njectifying in its approach to working class people, oral history follows the ac-\ncounts that are constructed by people themselves as active agents. Oral history\nforces us to realise that there is a lot more to the working class than just the work-\ning life. This approach produces problems, or more correctly challenges, for\nexisting theoretical traditions and in a comment that prefigured the debate on\nthe relationship with Marxism, Portelli was of the opinion that oral history ap-\nproaches would ultimately contribute to the creation of a \u201cmore complex Marx-\nism.\u201d Any accounts of working-class life that can\u2019t and don\u2019t engage with issues\nsuch as respect and other feelings were seen to be lacking in some fundamental\nways. In conclusion Portelli produced a refreshing inversion of much that is cur-\nrently taken as read about working-class life, he argued that one of the main mes-\nsages of the work that he has undertaken is that there exists a \u201cthin layer of the\nartificial\u2014of T.V., of shopping malls\u201d beyond which more fundamental issues of\nlife, death, of survival, both in literal and in cultural terms, remains alive and ac-\ncessible to those who will listen.\nMany of the presentations at the conference shared with the Portelli ac-\ncount an iconoclastic interrogation of what stands as accepted wisdom about the\nnature of the working class. This is possible because of the reflexive nature of\nmuch of the research being undertaken. One of the real strengths of working-\nclass studies as witnessed at Youngstown is that the work being undertaken is\nnot just of academic interest to detached researchers. Rather the practice of\nworking-class studies involves a commitment not only to rigorous research but\nalso simultaneously to a critical pedagogy that recognizes the often-classed na-\nture of the formal process of education itself. The ability and willingness of re-\nsearchers to situate themselves in relation to the class-based processes involved\nin the education system with its conventions and proclivities, its preoccupations\nand silences is truly refreshing and stands in stark contrast to the objectivist po-\nsitions that seem the only accepted standpoints in relation to the study of social\nclass in England. This more reflexive approach is further strengthened by the in-\nterdisciplinary nature of working-class studies that was so apparent in most of\nthe sessions. Panels saw sociologists sitting alongside scholars of English litera-\n178 ILWCH, 61, Spring 2002\nture or American studies, geographers together with economists and philoso-\nphers and importantly the focus upon the overriding substantive importance of\nworking-class studies ensured that those from such different disciplines could ef-\nfectively communicate with each other. In the sessions I attended I didn\u2019t wit-\nness any of the disciplinary imperialism that is sometimes a feature of more spe-\ncialist conferences.\nAs you can probably tell by now I was well impressed by this conference in\nfact I consider it to be the best conference that I have ever attended in the twen-\nty-three years that I have been involved in higher education! There is one fur-\nther reason why I rate this conference so highly, and Michael Zweig drew at-\ntention to this in one of the plenary sessions where he praised the \u201cgenerosity of\nspirit\u201d that was evident in the interactions between participants. This quality\ncannot be explained in terms of the structure of the conference but may have\nsomething to do with the substance, unveiling the silencing of people can make\nus pause and reflect upon our own willingness to listen. More specifically how-\never in the case of Youngstown the co-directors of the center, Sherry Linkon and\nJohn Russo have created something very special which is imbued with such a\ngenerosity and I am grateful to them that for the duration of the conference this\nappears to be catching. This conference with its intellectually stimulating mate-\nrial, its interdisciplinary format and its generosity of spirit is what I came into\nacademia for. I am already eagerly looking forward to returning to Youngstown\nin 2003 for the next conference.
