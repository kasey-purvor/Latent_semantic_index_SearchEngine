However, toxic shock loads produced a N2O response of a rise 26 \nin off-gas concentrations ranging from 16.5 - 186.3 ppm, followed by a lag-time 27 \nranging from 3-5 h ((0.43-0.71)*HRT) of increased NH3-N and\/or NO2- in the effluent 28 \nranging from 3.4 - 41.2 mg.L-1.

Introduction 38 \n 39 \nNitrogen removal has become an important part of wastewater treatment processes 40 \ndue to the significant impact of nitrogen compounds (NH4+-N, NO3--N and NO2--N) 41 \non the aquatic environment and more stringent legislation on wastewater discharges. 42 \nDischarge limits for nitrogen have been now set between 10 and 15 mg.L-1 within the 43 \nEuropean Community and some developed countries have even more stringent 44 \nrestrictions (Jonsson et al., 2001).  To meet this demand, the most commonly used 45 \nmethod for nitrogen removal is biological treatment based on aerobic nitrification and 46 \nanoxic denitrification, both of which may produce nitrous oxide (N2O) (Colliver and 47 \nStephenson, 2002).  48 \n 49 \nIn microbial nitrification, N2O formation can occur in two ways during the oxidation 50 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 3 - \nof ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2-) (Prosser, 1989): (i) reduction of NO2- catalysed by 51 \nnitrite reductase (NiR); (ii) chemical decomposition of NO2- or intermediates (NH2OH) 52 \nof ammonia oxidation (Itokawa et al., 2001).  Although the actual mechanism is still 53 \nlargely unknown or debatable, the efficiency of ammonium conversion to N2O 54 \nappears to be higher at low oxygen concentrations or low sludge retention times (SRT) 55 \n(Goreau et al., 1980; Noda et al.,2003; Kampschreur et al., 2008).  The biological 56 \ndenitrification process removes the excess nitrogen by reducing NO2- and NO3- to 57 \nmolecular nitrogen (N2).  It is during this process that N2O is an obligate intermediate 58 \n(Wicht, 1996).  Several factors, such as low influent COD\/total nitrogen (TN,) high 59 \ndissolved oxygen (DO) and low pH, may stimulate production of N2O during the 60 \ndenitrification process (Hanaki et al., 1992; Burgess et al., 2002a).  Furthermore, N2O 61 \ncan also be produced by nitrifier denitrification (ND pathway) where the oxidation of 62 \nNH4+ into NO2- is followed by the reduction of NO2- to N2O and N2 (Bock et al., 1995;  63 \nItokawa et al., 2001).  The sequence of reactions is carried out by only one group of 64 \nmicroorganisms, namely autotrophic NH3-oxidizers, typified by Nitrosomonas 65 \neutropha (Wrage et al., 2001).  It is unsurprising that high N2O emissions have been 66 \nobserved in a variety of wastewater treatment processes.  However, N2O gas has an 67 \nadverse impact on the environment (von Schulthess et al., 1994), as it is known to be 68 \none of the greenhouse gases under the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 where reduction targets 69 \nwere agreed (Dore et al., 2005). 70 \n 71 \nWhen toxic upsets occur the system receives a loading shock, resulting in lower 72 \ntreatment efficiency or process failure (Gutierrez et al., 2002).  If toxicants do hinder 73 \nthe activity of nitrifying bacteria, it will cause leakage of ammonia into the effluent, 74 \noften resulting in breaches of discharge consents (Hayes et al., 1998).  With the need 75 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 4 - \nto stringently monitor toxic shock loads, there has been an increase in new techniques 76 \nand technologies available for monitoring changes in wastewaters, e.g. on-line NH3 77 \nanalysers and respirometers (Vanrolleghem and Lee, 2003).  The purpose of these 78 \nonline monitoring instruments is to obtain specific information about changes in 79 \nwastewater quality (particularly at the inlet) and to ensure treatment efficiency for 80 \ncompliance assessment and control (Bourgeois et al., 2001).  There are currently two 81 \nmain types of on-line early warning methods: respirometric methods and microbial 82 \nmethods both of which require analysis of dissolved compounds (Vanrolleghem and 83 \nLee, 2003).  These technologies allow for early warning but can be costly to maintain, 84 \ngive false negatives (Love and Bott, 2000) and are prone to sensor fouling due to the 85 \nhostile environment in which the sensors have to be placed (Pedersen and Petersen, 86 \n1996).  More recently, Burgess et al (2002a) demonstrated a strong relationship 87 \nbetween ammonia shock loads and the concentration of N2O in the off-gas from the 88 \naeration tank.  This suggests that the changes in N2O concentration in the exhaust gas 89 \nfrom a nitrifying process may be a useful parameter for monitoring such processes 90 \n(Burgess et al., 2002b; Butler et al., 2005a).  As a result, a more efficient early-91 \nwarning system for the nitrification processes can be established based on N2O 92 \nemissions as long as the off-gas N2O concentration can be monitored on line. 93 \n 94 \nThe purpose of this work therefore was to gain a better understanding of the 95 \ncorrelation between N2O accumulation and the increasing of effluent NH3\/NO2 in 96 \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTP) under varying shock loads and further to 97 \nestablish whether off-gas N2O could be used as a non-invasive early warning indicator 98 \nto predict nitrification failure.  99 \n 100 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 5 - \n2. Materials and Methods 101 \n 102 \n2.1 Activated sludge pilot plant 103 \n 104 \nA pilot-scale activated sludge plant (Fig. 1) comprising of a control and test lane was 105 \nused to represent full-scale sewage works as recommended in the literature (Horv\u00e1th 106 \nand Schmidtke, 1983).  Each lane plant consisted of an aeration tank (315 L) and a 107 \nclarifier (100 L).  An anoxic selector zone with a volume of 10L was used as a dosage 108 \nmixing area for shock load experiments.  For the initial start-up, the aeration basin 109 \nwas filled with half wastewater and half recycled activated sludge (RAS) from a full-110 \nscale municipal waste water treatment works (Anglian Water, Cotton Valley, UK).  111 \n 112 \nFig.1-Schematic diagram of the pilot-scale activated sludge plants 113 \n 114 \n2.2 Plant operation 115 \n 116 \nThe influent settled sewage was supplied from Cranfield University Wastewater 117 \nTreatment Works at a rate of 45 L.h-1 giving a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 7 h. 118 \nThe wasted activated sludge (WAS) and Recycled Activated Sludge (RAS) were 119 \ndelivered by a peristaltic pump (505U, Watson and Marlow, UK).  Sludge 120 \nrecirculation was controlled at 100% of the average influent flow.  The sludge age 121 \nwas maintained at approximately 15 d after the acclimatization period.   122 \n 123 \n2.3 Experimental design and approach 124 \n 125 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 6 - \nPrior to the experiments, the pilot plants were operated for at least two sludge ages 126 \n(30 d) with stable process performance parameters as expected for a full-scale 127 \ntreatment plant.  Two lanes were used, a test to measure any response from the shock 128 \nload and a control to ensure validity of the response.  Following each shock load, the 129 \ntest  was allowed to return to pre-shock stable-operation for one sludge age before the 130 \nnext shock load. At the start of each shock load (0 h), the mixed liquor dissolved 131 \noxygen (MLDO), pH, temperature and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) as well 132 \nas influent and effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH3-N, NO2--N, NO3--N 133 \nand N2O were measured in both test and control.  The influent and effluent NH3-N, 134 \nNO2--N, NO3--N, N2O and DO were monitored either every 30 min or every 60 min 135 \nfor the duration of the 9 h experimental period.  There was a total of eight shock loads, 136 \ndefined as runs 1-8, with repetition of each experiment (see Table 1).   137 \n 138 \nFor Runs 1 and 2, the aim was to reduce the ML DO concentration to <1.0 mg.L-1 for 139 \n1 h, after which the air was turned back on.  This was accomplished by turning the air 140 \noff at 0 h and then turning it back on at 1 h.  Ammonia overload experiments (Runs 3 141 \nand 4) were undertaken by adding 2.55 g of NH3-N (7.5 g of NH3Cl dissolved in 1 L 142 \nof distilled H2O) to the test pilot plant lane with a shock load calculated to exert an 143 \ninstantaneous NH3-N loading of 2.7mgNH3-N g MLSS-1 (mean value) and an oxygen 144 \ndemand of 3.5 mg.L\u20131 on the 315 L aeration tank.  The shock load was added via a 145 \nperistaltic pump at a rate of 45 L.h-1 to the anoxic zone at 0 h.  146 \n 147 \nAllylthiourea (ATU) is an effective inhibitor of nitrification processes, blocking the 148 \nNH3-N to NH2OH step of ammonia oxidation by inhibiting Nitrosomonas and not 149 \naffecting the heterotrophic biodegradation activity (Hall, 1984; Reuschenbach et al., 150 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 7 - \n2003). In this experiment (Runs 5 and 6), a shock load of ATU of 239.4 mg dissolved 151 \nin 1 L of distilled H2O was pumped at 45 L.h-1 into the anoxic zone at 0 h.  Sodium 152 \nazide (NaN3) is a strong, selective inhibitor of nitrite oxidation.  It inhibits the 153 \noxidation of NO2- to NO3- but does not affect the oxidation of NH4+ to NO2- (Ginestet 154 \net al., 1998). Two NaN3 shock loads (Runs 7 and 8) were carried out to examine the 155 \nN2O response when interrupting the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate.  A shock load of 156 \n7.245 g of NaN3 dissolved in 1 L of distilled H2O was pumped at 45 L.h-1 into the 157 \nanoxic zone at 0 h, a dose calculated to give 75 % inhibition.  158 \n 159 \n2.4 Analytical methods 160 \n 161 \nA gas analyser (7700 IR, Signal, UK), which used a dual-beam non-dispersive 162 \ninfrared (NDIR) method, accurately measured N2O gas ranging from 0 - 1,200 ppm (\u00b1 163 \n1 %).  The N2O monitor was calibrated from compressed air and 1,000 ppm N2O 164 \n(BOC Group Plc, UK) weekly, with a detection limit of 0.1 ppm.  The N2O 165 \nconcentration was initially read from the front screen panel, but the NaN3 experiments 166 \nused a datalogger to store the results (Squirrel 400, Grant, UK).  Simultaneously, an 167 \nN-TOX\u00ae N2O analyser (Water Innovate Ltd, UK) was used in one of the NaN3 168 \ninhibition experiments to quantify off-gas N2O emissions.  The gas analyser remained 169 \nseparate from the activated sludge at all times, drawing off-gas by a small pump 170 \nhoused in the gas analyser from the headspace of a hood on the surface of the aeration 171 \ntank via Perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) tubing.  The non-contact method avoided operational 172 \nproblems normally associated with sensor fouling and corrosion. 173 \n 174 \nInfluent and effluent COD, NH3-N, NO2--N, NO3--N were detected with Hach vial 175 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 8 - \nmethods (Camlab and Merck vial method, Vwr International adapted from Standard 176 \nMethods, APHA, 1998).  Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) were measured 177 \naccording to Standard Methods (American Public Health Association, 1998). 178 \n 179 \n3. Results 180 \n 181 \nThe pilot-scale activated sludge plant received concentrations of COD and NH3-N 182 \nranging from 136 - 326 and 21.5 - 45.3 mg.L-1 respectively (Table 2).  Pre-shock 183 \nstable operation data showed that the pilot plants had COD and NH3 removals ranging 184 \nfrom 64.0 - 91.2 % and 93.5 - 100 % respectively, mimicking that of a full-scale plant 185 \n(Table 2).  During pre-shock operation, N2O emissions were low and showed little 186 \nvariation ranging from 0 - 0.5 ppm (Table 2).  Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) 187 \nvaried from 1508 - 4261 mg.L-1 and ML pH ranged from 6.39 - 7.12 in the activated 188 \nsludge lanes (Table 3).  Mixed liquor dissolved oxygen ranged from 1.8 - 4.7 mg.L-1 189 \nand ML temperature ranged from 16.1 - 21.0\u2103 (Table 3).  During all shock loads, the 190 \ncontrol-rig was monitored along side the test-rig and no responses in terms of N2O, 191 \nML DO and effluent NH3; NO2- and NO3- were observed. 192 \n 193 \nIn both the O2 deprivation runs (Runs 1 and 2), the air was turned off for a period of 1 194 \nh and ML DO was seen to drop below 1 mg.L-1 (Fig.2).  There was no submersible 195 \npump to maintain mixing of the MLSS, and so no N2O was observed in the first hour 196 \n(Fig. 2).  When the air was turned back on, there was an immediate rise in the N2O 197 \nconcentration and a peak could be seen over the following 2 h at 16.5 and 17.1 ppm 198 \nfor Runs 1 and 2 respectively.  In other words, the maximum N2O emission occurred 199 \nafter 1 h from the start of aeration, which was mainly due to the lower ML DO (below 200 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 9 - \n1 mg.L-1) during the first two hours.  After the peak, the N2O emission rates in two 201 \nruns were decreased gradually and were stable at relatively low levels after the DO 202 \nrose to pre-shock concentrations (about 4 h (Run 1) and 5 h (Run 2) after the 203 \nadjustment).  204 \n 205 \nFig. 2- Run 1 (a) and Run 2 (b) - Loss of aeration experiment; Headspace N2O, 206 \nNH3-N Effluent, NO3--N Effluent and Dissolved Oxygen (secondary y-axis); A 207 \nvertical line at 7h shows when that the experimental period reached one HRT. 208 \n 209 \nIncreases in effluent NH3 can be seen at 7 h (one HRT) in both runs, although during 210 \nRun 1 higher increase to 13.1 mg.L-1 compared with 3.4 mg.L-1 in Run 2 was 211 \nobserved.  Nitrite was also monitored in Run 2 and was seen to rise to around 2.5 \u2013 212 \n5mg.L-1 with effluent NH3 at the HRT, with a concurrent decrease in effluent NO3- 213 \nconcentrations. 214 \n 215 \nIn Runs 3 and 4, the ammonia shock experiment, initial influent NH3 concentration 216 \nwere 32.4 and 41.3 mg.L-1 respectively.  With ammonia shock loads of 2.82 (Run 3) 217 \nand 2.61 (Run 4) mgNH3-N g[MLSS]-1, an instantaneous sharp increase was seen in 218 \nthe N2O emissions (Fig.3), with maximum peaks of 18.3 and 22.3 ppm for Runs 3 and 219 \n4 respectively, which then declined to pre-shock concentrations.  A sharp increase in 220 \neffluent NH3 was also observed after one HRT, with maximum concentrations of 41.2 221 \nmg.L-1 (Run 3) and 39.1mg.L-1 (Run 4) respectively.  On the other hand, an increase 222 \nof effluent NO2--N occurred in run 4 (Fig 3b) but on a smaller scale at approximately 223 \n1.5 mg.L-1 NO2--N, which might be explained by the relatively low levels of the 224 \nammonia shock load.  A simultaneous drop in ML DO, i.e. declining from 2 to 0.3 225 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 10 - \nmg.L-1 in Run 3 and 2.8 to 0.8 mg.L-1 in Run 4, was seen following the ammonia 226 \nshock load, recovering 3 h later in both runs.  The minimum of the ML DO was 227 \naccompanied by a peak in N2O emission 60 min after the start of the ammonia shock 228 \nloads.  229 \n 230 \nFig. 3-Run3 (a) and 4(b).Ammonia shock experiment; Headspace N2O, NH3-N 231 \neffluent, NO3--N effluent and Dissolved Oxygen (secondary y-axis). A vertical line 232 \nat 7h shows when that the experimental period reached one HRT.  233 \n 234 \nAn initial ATU dose of 23.94 mg, calculated to give a 75 % inhibition to activated 235 \nsludge (CIWEM, 1997), gave no response.  So the dosage was increased to 239.4 mg 236 \nATU for runs 5 and 6.  After the ATU addition, immediate rises in N2O off-gas 237 \nconcentrations of 26.7 and 20.1 ppm were observed for Runs 5 and 6 respectively 238 \nfollowed by a 4 h recovery period to pre-shock concentrations (Fig. 4). After one 239 \nHRT, a simultaneous increase in effluent NH3 and a decrease in effluent NO3- were 240 \nobserved in both runs. Maximum observed NH3-N were at concentrations of 11.4 and 241 \n12.5 mg.L-1 for Runs 5 and 6, with NO2- effluent increasing also at the HRT (Fig 4b).  242 \nUnlike the two former experiments, ML DO in these two runs increased slightly 243 \nduring first two hours and then reverted to pre-shock concentrations gradually.  This 244 \nindicated that the rise in N2O off-gas was directly related to toxicity, and not due to 245 \nthe impact of available oxygen. 246 \n 247 \nFig.4-Run 5 (a) and Run 6 (b).

As shown in Fig. 5, an immediate and sharp rise in N2O 254 \nemission occurred, peaking at 186.3 and 147.5 ppm for Runs 7 and 8 respectively, but 255 \ndid not recover to pre-shock concentrations.  In particular, it should also be mentioned 256 \nthat N2O emission characteristics or patterns in these two runs were significantly 257 \ndifferent.  A remarkable N2O peak occurred in Run 7, after which the N2O profile 258 \ndeclined gradually.  In contrast, during Run 8, a sharp and continuous rise of N2O 259 \nconcentration was observed but had not reached a peak until at 7 h ( one HRT), 260 \nfollowed by a constant level for the prolonged reaction.  Concomitantly, there was a 261 \ndrop in effluent NO3- at 7h and an increase in effluent NO2- to maximum observed 262 \nconcentrations of 9.8 and 8.7 mg.L-1 for Runs 7 and 8 respectively.

Discussion 280 \n 281 \nIn both the loss of aeration and ammonia overloading experiments, the transient 282 \naccumulation of N2O was observed in the aerobic period, followed by a lag time of 283 \napproximately 3-5 h before an increase in NH3-N and NO2--N effluent.  It is this lag 284 \ntime that provided the early warning.  These results confirmed the findings of Burgess 285 \net al. (2002b), who proposed that off-gas N2O from aeration tanks can provide early 286 \nwarning of nitrification failure when effective loss of dissolved oxygen occurs, either 287 \ndue to loss of aeration or a high oxygen demand load. In the oxygen depletion 288 \nexperiments, the N2O increase was not observed until the air was turned back on.  289 \nKimochi et al. (1998) also observed N2O concentrations in the headspace to be the 290 \nhighest immediately after starting aeration and gradually decreasing with time.  291 \nSimilar results were reported by Zheng et al. (1994) and Burgess et al. (2002b), who 292 \nboth found that a high concentration of N2O was produced by activated sludge 293 \nsystems during the nitrification process under low DO conditions.  Moreover, Noda et 294 \nal. (2003) revealed that N2O emission was accelerated under low DO conditions 295 \ninsufficient for nitrification.  Previous authors have reported that the mechanism for 296 \nN2O release by ammonia oxidisers is a simultaneous reduction of NH3 and oxidation 297 \nof NO2- (Poth and Focht, 1985; Anderson et al., 1993; Bock et al., 1995).  Research 298 \nby Poth and Focht (1985) has shown that NO2- could act as an electron acceptor 299 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 13 - \nduring oxygen-limited nitrification.  Their findings suggested that ammonia oxidizing 300 \nbacteria (AOB) such as Nitrosomonas possess a nitrite reductase enzyme, which is 301 \nactivated under oxygen-limiting conditions and dominated over the nitrite 302 \noxidoreductase enzyme.  The decrease in effluent NO3- for the experiments when 303 \naeration was ceased suggested that the nitrite oxidisers were inhibited due to the lack 304 \nof oxygen and were unable to oxidise the NO2- through to NO3-.  Also, Laanbroek and 305 \nGerads (1993) demonstrated that the ability of ammonia oxidisers to substitute oxygen 306 \nwith nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor at low oxygen concentrations gave them 307 \na competitive edge over nitrite oxidisers.  308 \n 309 \nBased on the above discussion, we concluded that the increase in N2O concentration 310 \nin DO depleted experiments was a result of the decrease in DO, which caused the 311 \nbacteria to use nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor (Kuai and Verstraete, 1998).  312 \nHowever, in municipal wastewater treatment plants, nitrogen removal is achieved at 313 \nlow oxygenation to reduce cost, i.e. in conditions favorable to N2O production.  So, 314 \non-line monitoring ML DO and off-gas N2O emissions for the biological nitrification 315 \nprocesses could be of significance in terms of saving operating costs as well as 316 \nprotecting the environment. Recent simulation studies undertaken by Sivret et al. 317 \n(2008) indicate that nitrous oxide could be used to provide better control of aeration in 318 \nnitrifying activated sludge plants.  319 \n 320 \nIn both the inhibitor experiments, a N2O response was followed by an increase in 321 \neffluent NH3 and\/or effluent NO2-.  It is again the lag time that provided the early 322 \nwarning for nitrification failure.  By the addition of an inhibitor, nitrification did not 323 \nprogress sufficiently, and thus accumulation of ammonia and\/or nitrite was observed. 324 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 14 - \nFor the ATU inhibitor experiment, since the first step of nitrification was blocked, 325 \nN2O emissions were probably produced only through denitrification by heterotrophic 326 \ndenitrifying bacteria.  Although the N2O emission rate from the denitrification 327 \npathway is lower under a high oxygen concentration compared to that at low oxygen 328 \nconcentration, N2O was observed since denitrifying bacteria are able to denitrify in 329 \naerobic conditions (Krul and Veemingen, 1977).  Likewise, a previous study has also 330 \nobserved that the N2O concentration increased when an ATU dose of 0.076 mg.L-1 331 \nwas applied to the aeration tank (Burgess et al., 2002b). At full-scale, the off-gases 332 \ncan be captured via a hood before delivery to the N2O detection system; this has been 333 \ndemonstrated on full-scale industrial and municipal activated sludge plants (Butler et 334 \nal., 2005b).  335 \n 336 \nMitigation of nitrification toxicity could be achieved by a range of possible actions; 337 \nthe simplest might be diversion of incoming flow to holding tanks, to be blended into 338 \nthe plant over time. Alteration of process operating conditions that are recognised as 339 \nfavourable to nitrification, e.g. pH adjustment and increasing aeration, is another 340 \nobvious strategy. If the cause of the toxic event is a known chemical, then a specific 341 \nmitigation strategy could be used e.g. addition of multivalent cations to prevent 342 \nnitrification inhibition by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Hu et al., 2003). 343 \nBioangmentation with nitrifying bacteria has also been used to improve ammonia 344 \nremoval, however, large amounts would be needed for severe shocks (Abeysinghe et 345 \nal., 2002). It is also possible that addition of copper could stimulate nitrification 346 \n(Ensign et al., 1993). 347 \n 348 \n5. Conclusions 349 \nTPIRCSUNA\nM DETPECCA\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n - 15 - \n 350 \nAll shock loads experiments showed that the observed N2O peak always preceded the 351 \nappearance of ammonia\/nitrite in the effluent by approximately 3-5 h, i.e. 352 \n0.43~0.71*HRT.  It is this lag time, before NH3 and\/or NO2- appears in the effluent, 353 \nwhich provides early warning for nitrification failure.  The increase of N2O emission, 354 \ntherefore, may be a good indicator for monitoring the nitrification process, as they are 355 \ncorrelated to both influent wastewater characteristics (e.g. ammonia load, toxic 356 \ninhibitors) and operational parameters (e.g. DO) for the aeration tank.  357 \n 358 \nAcknowledgement 359 \n 360 \nThis investigation was funded in part by Severn Trent Water through an industrial 361 \nCASE studentship and the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council 362 \n(EPSRC).
