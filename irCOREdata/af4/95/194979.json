The same applies to a large extent, to \nthe concepts and practices linked to educational leadership in the multi-ethnic British \nsociety. This approach tends to ignore the rich diversity of the societal fabric where more \nthan a quarter of the population is of different ethnic origins (National Statistics 2001), \nwith diverse socio-cultural and knowledge heritages.  \n \nThe growing multi-cultural nature of educational institutions (Shah 2004) underpins the \nneed to acknowledge, and to respond to this diversity. Different cultures reflect different \nvalues and patterns of behaviour (Marsh 1994). Accordingly, cultural circumstances alter \nthe views that people take about a given issue (Greenfield 1993: 461) and influence \napproaches and practices. This paper is an effort to draw attention to the knowledge gap \nin theory and application regarding diverse perspectives of educational leadership - an \nissue which is foreseen as gaining higher significance with the fast changing societal \nstructures in Britain.  \n \nThis paper discusses an Islamic perspective of educational leadership. The current focus \nis influenced by the fact that there are 1.8 million Muslims in Britain (The Guardian \n2002), and according to the National Statistics (2001), they emerge as the largest \nreligious group after Christianity. Secondly, unlike some other faith groups, Muslims \ntend to highlight their religious identity (Brah 1996; Jacobson 1998; Modood 1990; \nModood et al 1997; Nielsen 1987). And finally, any association between the \nethnicity\/identity and educational performance\/achievement of the Muslim students in the \nBritish education system should not foreclose the possibilities of exploring the impact of \nhow leadership is conceptualized by them.  \n \n 2 \nAccording to the national statistics (2001), 52% Muslims in Britain fall within the age \ncategory of under 24, and 50% are British born citizens not \u201esojourners\u201f, as Haddad \n(2002) argues, and many are in HE (Modood 1997: 73; 82) with implications for \neducational leaders regarding expectations and experiences of these young people. 33.8% \nof the Muslims are aged 0-15 years and fall within the compulsory education age. How \nthey conceive and perceive educational leadership, and how they receive it, is bound to \ninteract with their learning experience and performance. Furthermore, in the backdrop of \nthe current increasing demand for faith schools from the Muslims in Britain, a multi-\ndirectional knowledge sharing can be contributive to societal cohesion and stability as \nwell as to improved practice and performance on educational sites. \n \nThis paper introduces leadership as a concept formulated in context. It briefly presents \nphilosophical and theoretical underpinnings of these conceptualizations from an Islamic \nperspective, and discusses the broader aims of education in Islam and their contribution \ntowards the development of \u201eself\u201f (nafas), to provide a background to locate educational \nleadership. The high status of knowledge in Islam and the interplay between knowledge \nand leadership, which underpin notions of educational leaders in Muslim societies, are \nexplored to provide a philosophical anchoring to these conceptualisations. How these \ndiscourses interact to formulate concepts of educational leadership in Muslim societies is \ndiscussed next. The implications of these constructions in the societies where Muslims \nare in minority are debated in the final section with a focus on the British context and the \nnotions of educational leadership in the Western leadership literature. \n \nEducational Leadership in Context \nThe concept of educational leadership varies across societies and cultures. Different \ninterpretations of leadership reflect the ways of looking at it and the philosophical and \ntheoretical assumption behind them:  \n \n\u2026 classifications, theories and descriptions depend not only upon the way the world \nis but also upon what it is we want to show or display. It is not reasonable to suppose \n 3 \nthat there could be one classification or descriptive scheme, which could serve for all \npurposes. (Hughes 1990:158)  \n \nVariations in interpretation arise also because in different societies \u201eleadership derives \npower and influence from different formal or informal sources of position, person, \nknowledge, and wisdom\u201f (Mullins 1995:229; also Handy 1995; Sergiovanni 1984). Even \nsimilar concepts and procedures carry different meanings and understandings, for \nexample: \n \nFor the Russians the consensus has traditionally been something handed down in \nfully approved form from a centralised authority, whereas in Canada consensus is \nusually something established by a group of professionals working locally. \n(Begley 2003:46) \n \nRelevant literature highlights that the culture and ethos of leadership also \"differ in \nfundamental ways across nations\" (Fullan 1992:viii). How a particular society perceives \nand constructs educational leadership, therefore, needs to be understood and debated in \ncontext. When leadership is wrenched from the context and theorised, the complexity and \nambiguity of the concept and subsequent difficulties in interpretation\/s increase. Pugh and \nHickson discuss education as a \u201edeeply cultural institution\u201f (Pugh and Hickson 2003:11) \nwhere theory and practice are shaped by the values, beliefs, ideologies, behaviour and \nconventions in that social system. Child makes a similar argument, using the Weberian \nframework of formal rationality and substantive rationality to explain the impact of \nideational systems (cultural, religious and political) on social institutions, placing \neducation on the top (2003: 42).  \n \nHofstede\u201fs landmark study, in spite of the fact that it focuses on business management, \nhighlights the interplay between the culture and the practices, involving the managers \n(leaders!) and the managed (led!). He argues that ideas about leadership reflect the \ndominant culture (2001: 388), and cites examples to draw attention to the effect of societal \nconceptualisations on leadership practices. He compares countries like Norway and Sweden \n 4 \n\u201ewhere management assumed that initiative was to be taken by the subordinates\u201f, while in \nthe USA this tends to be seen as an infringement of the \u201emanagement prerogatives\u201f; and \nfrom a high power\/distance culture like Greece the subordinate\u201fs complain was \u201eHe is the \nboss. Why doesn\u201ft he tell me?\u201f when the expatriate US boss asked his opinion on how much \ntime a job should take (2001: 389). Walker & Dimmock (2002) discussing the impact of \nsocietal and organizational cultures on leadership theory and practice in education, argue \nthat the notion of educational leadership is formulated in the backdrop of values, patterns \nof behaviour and ideologies of a community. For example, the patriarchal notion of \nleadership in China draws its power and responsibilities from the social ideology drawn \nfrom Confucius, and functions within that value system (Tung, 2003). In Chinese society, \nsocial harmony is highly valued, and it determines the leadership concepts and practices - \nexpectations and responses - as reflected in the decision-making processes of a group of \nHong Kong principals (Walker 2002).   \n \n\u201eLeaders\u201f and the \u201eled\u201f participate in related activities informed by their ideological and \ncultural knowledge \u2013 transmitted from generation to generation and learned through \nliving and sharing with a group or community as its member - explained by Bourdieu \n(1977) as \u201ehabitus\u201f. An absence of the \u201etacit knowledge\u201f (Polanyi 1967) gained through \n\u201ehabitus\u201f poses an awareness gap for those leading educational institutions in \nmulticultural societies, and this requires deliberate efforts to devise measures for \nbecoming better informed. \n  \nAs different cultures, societies and communities construe leadership in different ways, \nthe need to explore these constructions becomes highly significant in multi-ethnic \ncontexts. In Islam, association between religion, knowledge and teaching creates a \ndiscourse of educational leadership, which elevates teaching\/learning to a sacred duty of \nthe highest order. The notion of teacher-leader in religious texts (Shah 1999a), and \nassociated discourses (Talbani 1996; Foucault 1977; 1980) has historically influenced \nand continues to influence these formulations and conceptualisations.  \n \n 5 \nFrom an Islamic perspective, \u201eleading\u201f has strong connotations of leading towards \nknowledge and \u201erighteousness\u201f, through \u201ewords\u201f and \u201eacts\u201f, entailing a knowledge status \nfor the teacher\/leader, as well as perceiving her\/him as a role model in a holistic sense, \nand this is debated in the next section. This conceptualization of teacher-leader, to a \ncertain extent, has been shared by different religions (Islam, Christianity, Hinduism), \ncultures (Chinese, Japanese), and ideologies (Bourdieu 1977; Freire 1972; 1973). There is \nno denying that under the impact of globalization, market pressures, institutional \nreorganizations, and internationalisation of technology, the blurred boundaries between \nteacher and leader, even in the more traditional societies, are changing into sharper \ndistinctions between teacher-leader\/manager-leader in some aspects. However, these \nsocio-economic processes are also introducing multiple similarities in leadership \npractices and theorising across diverse contexts. This may not eliminate specific \nideological features in some cases, but it could provide a forum for engagement and for \nenhancing understanding.  \n \nAn Islamic Perspective: Islam, Knowledge and Self \nReligious texts and teachings of Islam propound a particular philosophy of education and \neducational leaders, which provides a basis for similarities of concepts and practices \nwithin the overarching umbrella of Muslim Ummah\n2\n, and also underpins the perceptions \nand responses of Muslims in predominantly non-Muslim contexts. In spite of variations \nacross the range of Muslim societies, sacred religious texts remain the sources of \nlegitimation, contributing to a philosophical likeness. Any variations within and across \nthese societies are formulated at various intersections influenced by multiple factors. \nHowever, developments perceived as deviations from Islamic teachings often entail \nintense political and intellectual engagement to avoid \u201elegitimation crisis\u201f (Habermas \n1976; Giddens 1990) that could cause complications at implementation stage, as has been \nthe case in Pakistan over the recent years, in the efforts towards curriculum development \n(Nayyar and Salim 2002) and improving the system of examinations (Ali 2005; Hussain \n2005).  \n \n 6 \nThe notion of educational leadership in Islam derives from Islamic philosophy of \neducation, and contextual variations of conceptualization and practice across Muslim \nsocieties involve interpretations informed by an understanding of religious texts, which \nreinforces the interplay between faith and concepts. Muslim scholars often argue that the \nsocial, educational and related notions and concepts in Muslim societies \u201ecannot be truly \nappreciated without some accurate understanding of the Islamic faith and civilisation\u201f \n(Tabawi 1972:19). The basis of the Islamic philosophy of education is located in faith as \nreflected in the Quranic caveat that God is the ultimate knower (2.32): \n \n\u2026 and above every one possessed of knowledge is the All-knowing One.  \n(The Quran 12.76) \n \nThe claim is that all knowledge rests with God, and human beings are the best of creation \nbecause they partake of this Godly quality: \n \n God has bestowed on [human beings], and [human beings] alone among all the \ncreated things, ability to recognise, understand, and emulate the attributes of God, \nand realise them in practice in this life. (Hussain and Ashraf 1979:10) \n \nThe ontological debates and epistemic questions regarding the philosophy of knowledge \nin Islam and the nature of human knowledge are beyond the scope of this paper\n3\n. The \nfocus here is on the concept of educational leadership from an Islamic perspective, and \nthe debates contributing to the development of this concept in Muslim societies. \nNevertheless, some understanding of the nature of knowledge and the importance of the \nacquisition of knowledge from a Muslim perspective may be useful to understand why \nleadership, especially educational leadership is construed in particular ways by Muslims.  \n \nIslam, with its claims to universality and comprehensibility, seeks to encompass every \naspect of human endeavour. The aim of Islamic education is to develop humans through \nknowledge to enable them to follow the path of righteousness, and to become useful \nmembers of the Ummah and the society. This underpins the faith dimension of \u201eeducation \n 7 \nfor all\u201f4 in Islam where learning becomes a religious obligation, \u201ccompulsory on every \nMuslim male and female\u201d (Karim 1938:351), spanning the whole life5 (Al-Attas 1979; \nAshraf 1995; Maududi 1980; Nasr 1985; Tibawi 1972). The role of Islamic education is \nperceived as giving meaning to life and enriching it, instilling discipline and preserving \nhuman values, and strengthening and advancing human societies. These perceptions \ncontribute to enhanced expectations of Muslim learners and communities from \neducational institutions and leaders. \n \nThe Islamic theory of education derives from the Quranic concepts (Abdullah 1982:43). The \nnature of knowledge (revealed and acquired) and its contribution towards individual's \nholistic development are some such elements that shape the approach, and determine the \nrole of knowledge and the knowledge-givers. The stress on seeking and acquiring \nknowledge is one of the basic tenets of Islam, (Al-Bukhari, Vol. 1), emphasizing that only \nthose who have knowledge \u201etread the path of righteousness (taqwa)\u201f (the Quran 35:28), and \nit is linked to elevated status:  \n \n O mankind, We have created you from male and female; and We have divided you \ninto tribes and sub-tribes so that you could know each other. Verily the most \nhonoured (akramakum) of you in the sight of God is the most righteous (atqakum) \nof you. (The Quran 49:13) \n \nRighteousness is attained through knowledge and by application of that knowledge to every \naspect of life. The aim of education in Islam is to prepare human beings for leading a life of \n\u201erighteousness\u201f in a social context which underpins relevant conceptualizations on \neducational sites.  \n \nIn Islam, education is for the holistic development, and religion is not a mere set of moral \nprincipals, but a complete system encompassing and integrating the political, social, and \neconomic, as well as personal, moral, and spiritual aspects of life (Dabashi 1993:439; also \nMaududi 1980; Nasr 1985). Learning and knowledge are not a matter of individual choice \nor priority, determined by personal needs or market forces. It is a duty imposed by God and \n 8 \ndefined as the path to \u201erighteousness\u201f (Al-Attas 1979; Ashraf 1995; Tibawi 1972). Seeking \nknowledge is jihad\n6\n, an effort in the way of God\n7\n (Al-Bukhari, Vol. 1), aiming at the \ndevelopment of individual as a whole being so that s\/he acts for the sake of God: \n \n If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will \nenter paradise. (The Quran 4:124)  \n \nProceeding from this thesis, \u201eself\u201f is the site where knowledge articulates, and educational \nleaders are perceived as playing a significant role in this process. The Quranic view of self is \ndynamic with an infinite capacity for development: \n \n \u201eVerily We will raise you to higher and higher levels\u201f (84:19) \n \nAnd self is not a passive recipient of \u201ehigher levels\u201f. In fact, it is an active participant in \nactualising its potentialities, possessing an agency in creating and developing its \nsubjectivity: \n \n The self (nafs) owns only that which it earns and it changes through what it \nassimilates, good or bad. (The Quran 74:38) \n \nThe role of educational leadership, by virtue of being involved in knowledge building, \nand because of the status of knowledge in Islam (the Quran 2:70), is a major contributing \nfactor to this 'process of becoming\u201f (Choudury, 1993:6). Furthermore, seeking knowledge \nhas a collective dimension \u2013 to share that knowledge with others. Teaching\/learning \npertains to the realm of haqook-al-abaad (obligations of human beings to one another), \nand teaching is the duty of the prophets\n8\n who are perceived as Muallams (knowledge-\ngivers). The emphasis on the importance of teaching\/learning underpins the high status of \nteachers and educational leaders. As the aim of education embraces the development of \nthe Ummah and the society, this extends the role of educational leaders and teachers \nbeyond the institutions. The emphasis on the social and collective in Islam is evident in \n 9 \nthe pronouncement that \u201eGod will forgive the sins of faith but not those committed \nagainst other human beings\u201f (Al-Bukhari).  \n \nIslam, Education and Leadership \nThe Islamic philosophy of education draws from the belief that God, the ultimate knower, \n\u201etaught to man the knowledge of things\u201f (the Quran 96:1-5). The discourse of God as \nteacher raises teaching\/knowledge-giving to the level of the highest-status activity and \nestablishes the link between knowledge, knowledge sharing and leadership. Adam, the first \nhuman being in Islamic theology was made vicegerent on earth because God had \u201etaught \nAdam the nature of things\u201f (the Quran: 2:31). To this Adam the angels were asked to \nperform 'sijda'\n9\n (the Quran 2:34). The ensuing argument between God and the Archangel as \nto the cause of Adam's superiority (the Quran 2:30-33) underpins the high status of \nknowledge in Islam, and its association with leadership. The question is forcefully and \nclearly raised in the Quran:  \n \n Are those who possess knowledge and those who do not on equal footing?\n10\n (The \nQuran: 39:9) \n \nThe relevant points that emerge here are that in Islamic philosophy of knowledge, \nultimate knowledge lies with God, and human knowledge is limited and fragmentary; \nsecondly, knowledge and giving knowledge are Godly attributes; and thirdly, knowledge \nand sharing knowledge (teaching\/learning!) are the sources and justification of status and \nleadership. This perspective contributes to the blurring of boundaries between teacher and \nleader, and underpins theoretical constructions of educational leadership in Muslim \nsocieties.  The Quran repeatedly emphasises that none can grasp the meaning of revelations \nexcept men of understanding and those firmly grounded in knowledge (the Quran: 3:7-8; \n6:105; 22:55; 24:6), thus suggesting that only those who possess knowledge and \nunderstanding are capable of guiding and leading people, the tasks obligatory for the \nprophets. The promise made in a later verse that \"God will raise in ranks those of you who \nbelieve as well as those who are given knowledge\" (the Quran 58:11) is another example of \n 10 \nthe relationship between knowledge and status. The prophets, otherwise ordinary human \nbeings, have elevated status among mankind because of their knowledge\n11\n:  \n \nAnd certainly We gave knowledge to Dawood and Sulaiman, and they both said: \nPraise be to Allah, Who has made us to excel many of His believing servants. \n(The Quran 27:15) \n \nAnd then: \n \n\u2026 their prophet said to them: Surely Allah has raised Talut to be a king over you. \nThey said: How can he hold kingship over us while we have a greater right to \nkingship than he, and he has not been granted an abundance of wealth? He said: \nSurely Allah has chosen him in preference to you, and He has increased him \nabundantly in knowledge. (The Quran 2:247) \n \nThe prophets are often referred in the Quran as teachers. For example, the prophet \nMohammed, who was a religious and political leader, also taught men and women (Al-Hibri \n1982; Mernissi, 1991), and was called muallam (teacher). From this convergence of the \nreligious, social, political, and educational roles, evolves a concept of educational leadership \nin Islam, which has retained some of its distinctive ideological features over time. \n \nIn addition to that, teacher\/leader (Muallam) has the authority and status of a parent - the \nhighest authority in the Islamic social system (the Quran 6:151; 17:23; 29:8-9; 31:14; \n46:15). Its transference to the teaching role is indicative of the utmost respect accorded to \nteacher by the religion, and has implications for managing and leading Muslim students \nin multi-faith contexts like Britain. This concept of parent-like authority vested in \nteacher\/leader is balanced by responsibilities and by an emphasis on values and \naccountability; nevertheless, it provides another source for teacher\u201fs authority and \nleadership role, blurring the boundaries further. From this brief discussion, emerges a \nthree dimensional model of educational leadership with explicit overlaps: \n \n 11 \n Teaching with knowledge and understanding - educator \n Guiding with wisdom and values \u2013 prophet\/leader \n Caring with responsibility and commitment - parent \n \nThis merging of the discourses problematises conceptualisations across the range of \nMuslim societies and over times due to organisational changes, but the centrality of the \nteaching role and its association with leading dominates formulations of leadership \nconcepts, with knowledge and knowledge-giving as significant dimensions. Teaching, \nleading and caring become intertwined activities, with a wider remit. Islam agrees with \nthe broad educational aims of creating 'good individuals' and 'good citizens' but it \nattaches great importance to faith, piety and moral values as fundamental aims of \neducation (Al-Attas 1979:V). This widens the dimensions of the teacher's task, creating \n\u201ea close relationship between the teacher and the taught, spiritual as well as professional\u201f \n(Al-Attas 1979:111), combining the teacher and a wider leadership role into one. Men of \nknowledge and learning guide the learners nearer to God and are attributed the highest \nstatus as the 'heirs of prophets' (Al-Bukhari), which is one reason of a deeply embedded \nconcept of respect for the teacher\n12\n in Muslim societies, and contributes to the acceptance \nof their leadership role. \n \nThe fusion of multiple roles within the discourse of educational leadership underpinned the \nnotion of high respect for the teacher\/leader, particularly in early Islam, and it was \nstrengthened by the assumption that guiding towards knowledge was an act of giving which \ncould not be repaid. This explains why in the first few centuries of its advent there was no \nconcept of a paid teacher in the Muslim world\n13\n. The Muslim scholars taught in mosques or \nhomes to all those who came seeking knowledge (Al-Attas 1979:97). The ancient seats of \nlearning in Islam grew up around certain personalities who attracted people alike for their \nlearning and their piety (Hussain and Ashraf 1979:104). It was a process of \u201egiving\u201f \nknowledge and developing the self \u2013 developing the person of the learner as a whole by \nproviding guidance in all areas of personality. From this close articulation between religion \nand education emerged an Islamic notion of educational leadership, where knowledge and \n 12 \nthe conduct of the teacher\/leader both contributed in guiding the learners\u201f progress towards \nintellectual, moral and material development. \n \nHowever, the situation continued undergoing changes and modifications as Islam spread \ninto further areas, and interacted with different religions, cultures, and socio-economic \nbackgrounds. Al-Azhar was the first formal seat of learning established in Egypt in the \nfourth century, and was followed by Al-Nizamiyyah in Baghdad, where state-paid \nteachers were appointed (Tibawi 1972:30). These developments in education added new \ndimensions to the role of 'the leading scholar', involving management of more formal \nstructure, but without displacing the teacher\/leader discourse. The Muslim rulers \nrespected and admired eminent scholars, and at times sought their approval to win the \npublic support. Bernstein's in his interesting discussion of knowledge and control states:  \n \nThe way a society selects, classifies, distributes, transmits, and evaluates \neducational knowledge reflects both the distribution of power and the principles \nof social control. (1987:47)  \n \nLocal and global economic, social, and political changes are leading different societies \ntowards redefinitions of leadership role in different educational contexts, where the leader \n\"either provides solutions to the problems of people, or brings the hope that solutions are \npossible\" (Iqbal 1981:182). However, from an Islamic perspective, the institutional \nleadership continues to involve more than organizational management, including the \nresponsibilities for the holistic development of the learners and the wider community. The \nteacher is perceived as a leader, within and beyond the classroom context, expected to fulfill \nthe leadership role as a guide to knowledge and conduct, and to be a role model. This \nblurring of boundaries between the teacher and leader points to the extent of the \nexpectations of Muslim students from the educational leaders and teachers, and can partly \nexplain the respect and status commanded by the people in educational leadership positions, \nas well as the frustrations when the expectations remain unsatisfied.  \n 13 \n \nEducational Leadership and Muslim Communities \nGlobalisation (Giddens 1993; Reeves 1995), communication explosion (Braun and \nWarner 2003), internationalisation of technology, and economic universalism (Child \n2003) are drawing the world closer and smoothing out many differences in practices in \ndiverse fields of human activity, across societies and countries. However, there is an \nincreasing awareness of diversity and of the issues of identity embedded in cultures and \nsocial systems (Anwar 1998; Brah et al 1999; Hall 1993; Tajfel 1978; Vincent 2003), \nwhich is reflected in concepts and practices in education.  \n \nIn the case of Islam, issues of identity and impact of ideational systems on education and \nrelated concepts have deeper significance. In spite of the Modernism of the post-Second-\nWorld-War world, with its emphasis on \u201emeta narratives\u201f of democracy and equality \nnudging religion to the background, the tensions between the liberal and the religious \nthoughts in education have continued (Ahmed 1992), escalating with the revival of \nreligions in the post-modern world (Ahmed 1992; Ahmed and Donnan 1994; Bauman \n1996; 1997). The educational sites have, consequently, become locations for the interplay \nof competing notions and discourses (Foucault 1980), adding to the challenges of \nmanaging and leading multiethnic educational institutions.  \n \nAs mentioned above, the Muslims tend to highlight their religious identity, irrespective of \nthe level of commitment to religious practices. They are identified both by themselves \nand others as Muslims. Discussing why the British Muslims\u201f \u201eattachment to their religion \nis not progressively weakened or diluted as a result of the fact that they are living in non-\nMuslim society\u201f (Jacobson, 1998:126), Jessica Jacobson explains three levels of religious \noriented actions that make them distinctive \u2013 at the level of normal practice (prayers etc), \nroutine behaviour (dietary issues), and social conduct (morality code etc) (1998:128). She \ntreats religion (separately from ethnicity) as a basis of social identity in the case of \nMuslims, and explains it as \u201ecommitment to a universalistic religion with a global reach\u201f \n(1998:11). \n 14 \nSecondly, the history and the tradition of the religious institutions of learning (usually \ncalled madaras), which are, and have been led by religious scholars (Ulema) in the \nMuslim societies, have contributed to sustaining the relevant conceptualisations. These \neducational leaders have helped maintain the notion of educational leaders as spiritual, \nmoral and academic mentors. Even in the present day Muslim societies, when there are \nongoing heated debates concerning the knowledge status of the Ulema\n14\n and their \nteaching missions, the number and sizes of these institutions have been growing not only \nin the Muslim countries like Afghanistan, Indonesia, Lebanon, Pakistan and many others, \nbut even in many Western countries where Muslim are in minorities. The Ulema, due to \nthe tradition of respect accorded to religious scholars in Muslim societies, have enjoyed \nan easier access to masses in Muslim communities as compared to formal state-managed \neducational institutions; and in the absence of critical engagement with religious \nknowledge\n15\n among the masses, they have commanded respect and obedience through \ncontrol over interpretation of religious texts and discourses (Foucalt 1988; Shah 1998; \nTalbani 1996). The teachers\u201f leadership role and power diluted within the formal \nhierarchical power structures are thus re-appropriated within a religious discourse. \n \nThirdly, the ultimate source of reference in Islam is the Quran\n16\n. There can be variations \nin the interpretations of the Quranic teachings and commands (Al-Hibri 1982; Shah 1998) \nbut no refutations. The vast range of Muslim societies may formulate diverse \ninterpretations but the validation and authenticity of these interpretations is dependent on \nalignment with the authentic religious texts, mainly the Quran and the Hadith (the \nsayings of the prophet Mohammed). The concept of the teacher as leader derives directly \nfrom the Quran and the Hadith, and in spite of the debates around definitions of \nknowledge, teacher, leadership, and the realities of a material world, it retains \nassociations with status and respect in the Muslim societies. One explanation can be that \nthe education policies and systems of different Muslim states, such as Iran, Pakistan, \nSaudi Arabia and others, explicitly acknowledge their religious orientation and ethos, \nthus adding to the power of the discourse. For example, the first stated aim of Pakistan\u201fs \nNational Education Policy (1998-2010) is:  \n \n 15 \nWithin the context of Islamic perception, education is an instrument for \ndeveloping the attitudes of individuals in accordance with the values of \nrighteousness to help build a sound Islamic society. \n \nAll teachers\/educational leaders are required to possess certain religious knowledge to \nfulfil their roles as guides to knowledge and conduct, in keeping with the Quranic \nteachings. The specific guidelines in this policy document detail how to train all staff \n(teachers and leaders), who are also held responsible for \u201edissemination of information on \nfundamental principles of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran, and as applicable to the \ndevelopment of an egalitarian Muslim society\u201f (National education Policy 1998-2010: \n3.4.7.). The recruitment format for all staff emphasises basic knowledge of Islam, ability \nto read the Quran, religious practices and moral values as essentials. The political \ncompulsion to acknowledge their Islamic identity for legitimacy purposes can be an issue \nfaced by the Islamic countries, but this contributes to sustaining certain similarities across \ncommunities. \n \nAdmittedly, there are conceptual variations, not only in different Muslim societies and \ncountries, but also between different types of educational institutions (Siddique 1998). \nFor example, the educational leaders in the religious schools (madaras) in countries like \nPakistan and Indonesia\n17\n, and the government institutions in both the countries are \nexpressions of different conceptualisations, reflected in leadership styles and perceptions. \nHowever, the essential position remains unchallenged theoretically, that an educational \nleader must be a constant seeker and giver of knowledge, who acquires the right and \nresponsibility to lead through knowledge, in the tradition of the prophets. In addition to \nthat, an educational leader, from an Islamic perspective, is one who practices what s\/he \nteaches, thus ascertaining links between theory and practice.  \n \nThe next section weaves together the discussion with a focus on the British context. It \nwill seek to highlight the conceptual similarities and shared-ness in some notional fields \nbetween an Islamic leadership concept and some widely acclaimed Western notions of \neducational leadership. \n 16 \n \nImplication in the societies where Muslims are in minority \nThe primary aim of education in Islam is \u201eto facilitate developing those values whose \nroots are in the attributes of God and which God has planted within human beings as \npotentialities\" (Ashraf 1995). The educational leaders should ideally bring out these \n'potentialities' and develop them to the maximum possibilities, with a focus on \u201eholistic \ndevelopment\u201f. This philosophy of education, to some extent, is reflected in the liberal \nconcept of education promulgated by thinkers like Freire (1972). This extends the role of \nthe educational leader beyond the educational to include the intellectual, social, moral, \nspiritual, and even personal, with the responsibility of leading the people to the \u201eright \npath\u201f, or in Freire\u201fs words, to\u201f transform the world\u201f (1972:27). This also implies that the \nleader should possess the highest values, or as constructed in the Islamic philosophy, \u201e\u2026 \nthe one whom Allah has given wisdom and he acts according to it and teaches it to \nothers\u201f (Al-Bukhari Vol. 1).  \n \nIn spite of a philosophical uniqueness located in faith, Islamic notions of educational \nleadership share significant aspects of different leadership concepts, propounded in the \nWestern literature. Similarities can be perceived across certain dimensions of Islamic \nnotions of educational leadership and the leadership concepts such as reflective, \ntransformational, ethical\/moral, collaborative, dialogical and \u201eservant leadership\u201f. \nGoddard briefly describes fourteen leadership styles identified from the literature \n(2003:14), and in his discussion of servant leadership - where leadership has \u201eno personal \ngain\u201f but is only for a \u201ejust and right\u201f cause - he offers examples of Mohammed, Buddha \nand Christ as \u201ethe great religious teachers of the past\u201f (2003:16). This concept of \u201eservant \nleadership\u201f (Greenleaf 1996) for \u201eno personal gain\u201f, is reflected in the concept of unpaid, \ncommitted Muallam in early Islam (Shah 1999). But this is just one dimension\n18\n of a \ncomplex concept. It is a multidimensional notion, and as such bears similarities and \ndifferences. An enhanced understanding can add to developing the concept to the \nsatisfaction of wider stakeholders in multi-cultural contexts. The remaining discussion \nwill focus on certain shared attributes, arguing that myriad facets of Islamic philosophy \n 17 \nof educational leadership bear certain similarities with mainstream theorizing. The need \nis to recognize and value the overlaps, and avail these for enhanced understanding.  \n \nIn a presentation to the 2002 International Thinking Skills Conference, Robert Sternberg \nemphasises that educational leaders need wisdom. This growing emphasis on \u201ewisdom in \nleadership\u201f (Ribbins 2003:171), \u201ereflection\u201f (Schon 1983) and \u201evalues\u201f (Hodgkinson 1991) \nreflects diverse aspects of Islamic notions of educational leadership expounded fourteen \ncenturies ago. This highlights how two different sources and frameworks of thinking have \ncome to similar understandings. Discussing \u201eWhat is good leadership? What is good \nleader?\u201f Peter Ribbins  (2003:172) highlights the role of \u201ewisdom19\u201f and an understanding \nof values for the good leaders. Hodgkinson is very explicit in articulating the point that \n\u201eother things being equal, [institutions] will wish to appoint the wise men and women to \nits administrative offices\u201f (1996:8). These caveats reverberate the Quranic endorsement \nof people of knowledge and wisdom\n20\n as being the prophets, leaders and Muallams \u2013 who \nare guided by these qualities in reflection and practice. \n \nThe concept of reflective leadership (Schon 1983) has been gaining widespread acclaim \nover the last few decades. It is perceived as leading to self-understanding and \nunderstanding others, which can help resolve conflicts, tensions, and problems of division \nin organisations and societies. In Islam, meditation and reflection are highly emphasized \nas the attributes of prophets (Muallams!): \n \nAnd He has made subservient to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever \nis in the earth, all, from Himself; most surely there are signs in this for a people \nwho reflect. (the Quran 45:13)  \n \nThe earlier discussion highlighted the fluidity of the roles of prophets and Muallams. \nMohammed, the first educational leader in Islam (Ali 1964; Mernissi 1991a; Watt 1961), \nspent thirteen years in meditation before he was ordained as one who \u201eteaches \u2026 [people] \nthe Book and the wisdom and teaches \u2026 that which you did not know\u201f (the Quran \n2:151), and this underlines the interaction between teaching, leading and reflection. \n 18 \nWithdrawing from \u201epublic\u201f and going into seclusion to reflect remained a feature of \nMohammed\u201fs demeanor throughout his life (Mernissi 1991a). This practice echoes in \nGreenfield and Ribbins, suggesting to the educational leaders to withdraw from practice \nto reflect, arguing for: \n \n\"a kind of philosophic withdrawal to look at the larger issues in fresh \nperspectives. Perhaps they will return and administer as they were doing it before, \nbut with an added insight\". (Greenfield and Ribbins 1993: 257) \n \nThe high emphasis on reflection in Islamic theory and practice reverberates in Schon\u201fs \n(1983) theory of reflective practice and in Greenfield and Ribbins\u201f argument that \u201eWe \nneed leaders in education who can think about the larger issues\u201f (1993:258-9). Reflection \nis increasingly being perceived as creating a space to think and analyse, a stance equally \nvalued for learning (Bloom 1964; Kolb 1984) and leading (Schon 1987). Many studies \nrecommend \u201ethose stepping into the school leader's role to spend time reflecting on \npersonal values, ethical stances and other similar matters as a way of adjusting to the \ndemands of the 'hot seat' (Daresh 2000). The concept of reflection is no longer contested. \nThe unresolved phenomenon is \u201ehow\u201f, \u201ewhen\u201f and \u201eto what extent\u201f in the present day \nwork contexts, in view of the issues of time management for those in leadership \npositions, and the tensions around balancing action and reflection:  \n \n\u2026 the headlong pressure on educational leaders \u201eto act, to do, to be the leader\u201f, \nwhich militates against a reflective attitude \u2013 a stance which is needed for the \ngrowth of worthwhile values and of character (Greenfield & Ribbins 1993:258-9). \n \nThis draws attention to another dominant feature of leadership in Islam, being voiced \nstrongly in the recent literature on leadership - the emphasis on moral and ethical values \nfor leaders and teachers (Shah 2006). The Quran lays down an explicit charter of values \nand morality aiming at self-discipline and character building. The Prophet is an \nexpression of these moral and ethical values, as the Quran vouches, \u201eAnd most surely you \nconform (yourself) to sublime morality\u201f (68:4). The growing recognition of \u201emeditation \n 19 \non values\u201f (Greenfield and Ribbins 1993:262), and perception of \u201eLeadership a Moral art\u201f \n(Hodgkinson 1991; 1996; also Greenfield and Ribbins 1993; Sergiovanni 1992) in the \nrecent leadership literature recognizes this dimension by arguing that leaders have to take \nvalue-positions:  \n \nNotions of caring, justice and ethics are the foundations \u2026 The actions of the \nleader cannot be separated from the value positions held, for understandings of \n\u201eright\u201f, \u201ewrong\u201f, or even \u201e(not) appropriate\u201f, depend upon recognition of \nindividual world views and beliefs. (Goddard 2003:17)  \n \nMany research studies have highlighted the significance of leadership values in \ninstitutional contexts as contributive to \u201esuccess\u201f (Begley and Johansson 2003; Bennet \nand Anderson 2003; Day 2000; Harris and Chapman 2002; Harris et al 2003; Hopkins \n2001). A recent paper by Kathryn Riley discusses the \u201emoral and ethical imperatives that \ndrive school leaders\u201f (Riley et al 2004:2), arguing for leadership grounded in personal \nvalues drawing from ethical and moral roots. For Islamic leadership, the ultimate source \nof these values is faith and religious philosophy, but the aim in both cases is an emphasis \non basic human values and a realization to develop a \u201edistinction between right and \nwrong\u201f: \n \n\u201cIf moral leadership is to be exercised and pedagogy re-engineered with any \ndegree of success, then future leaders will need a firm set of values. No doubt \nmany will have their own list, but integrity, social justice, humanity, respect, \nloyalty and a sharp distinction between right and wrong, will all need to be \nincluded\u201f. (Bennet 2000:3) \n \nThis reinforces the Islamic perspective of emphasis on values. Muslims, as a \u201ecommunity \nof believers\u201f21, have always been as diverse and dense regarding culture, colour, \nlanguage, ethnicity, dress, and others, as a present day multi-cultural school in Britain. A \npoint worth considering is does the need for values increase with increased diversity! Is it \n 20 \nthe multicultural nature of Muslim Ummah that underpins the emphasis on values and \ninclusion, and to what extent can that approach be inclusive of non-Muslim perspectives? \n \nIslam proclaims equality and fraternity, and strongly favours consensus as the desirable \nsource of decision-making (Ahmed 1992; Nasr 1985). The emphasis on equality and \njustice in Islam aims at inclusion and embracing diversity (the Quran 49:13). This \nrequires an understanding and recognition of the values of all the diverse groups, \naddressing the issues around \u201ewhose values\u201f or \u201ewhat values\u201f. If values with morals and \nethics are \u201ethe very stuff of leadership\u201f (Hodgkinson 1991:11), the issue of \u201ewhose \nvalues\u201f gains central significance. Riley et al (2004:9) attend to the issue by discussing \nthe extent to which the leader\u201fs values and beliefs, the school\u201fs values and beliefs and the \ncommunity\u201fs values and beliefs are harmonized for effectiveness.  \n \nThe harmonization of multiple value-perspectives presupposes interaction between the \nleaders and the led \u2013 the led having more understanding of their situation than the leader \n(Freire 1972; 1973). This dialogical leadership is another concept embedded in Islamic \nphilosophy, where the mosque offered the space for dialogue, and where the Prophet \nengaged in dialogue with individuals and learners five times a day. Fatima Mernissi \n(1991a) highlights the prophet\u201fs willingness and patience to listen to opinions and \narguments, and to reflect on these before making any responses. The concepts of Ijtihad \n(Ahmed 1992) and Shura (Mernissi 1991a) are some other expressions of dialogical \nleadership. Dialogue, as a two-way activity, provides knowledge and understanding to \ntake informed value positions and make decisions. This can be valuable for the \neducational leaders, particularly in multi-ethnic contexts, to immerse themselves in their \ncommunity of learners to understand how certain actions are perceived and understood by \ndiverse sub-groups, because for those in marginalized communities, school leaders are \npredominantly outsiders. Reaching across these divides, with a focus on internal and \nexternal linkages helps build bridges: \n \n\u201eThe more we learn about others, the more collaborative, responsive, and linked \nto self-interests will be the work we can do with our partners\u201f  (Rubin 2002:xi) \n 21 \n \nThe notions of collaboration and sharing change epistemic orientation in context \u2013 in the \nexternal-to-school context the focus is on net-working, links, relationships; in the \ninternal-to-school context it has come to be perceived as distributed leadership (Fullan \n2001; Harris 2002; Harris and Lambert, 2003; Hopkins 2001; Telford 1996). \nTheoretically, both evolve from the premise of democratic practices underpinned by \ncommunication. Engaging many people in leadership activity is at the core of distributed \nleadership in action. The notion \u201eextends the boundaries of leadership significantly as it is \npremised upon high levels of \u201eteacher involvement\u201f and encompasses a wide variety of \n\u201eexpertise, skill and input\u201f (Harris and Lambert 2003:16). Hopkins (2001) claims that the \nform of leadership most often associated with improved learning outcomes is one that is \ndistributed or shared. The focus is the learner, as in Islam, and the aim is \n\u201eachievement\/effectiveness\u201f (\u201eholistic development\u201f!), which certainly requires a pooling \ntogether of leadership from all levels, and thus places increased emphasis on teachers\u201f \nleadership role and leaders\u201f teaching role. This does involves a \u201etransformational\u201f \ndimension, providing both intellectual stimulation and individual support to all those \nbeing led (Burns 1978). Burns concept of transformational leadership is predicated on a \npositively educative engagement between leaders and followers. Leithwood et al (1996) \nperceive it as a vision-driven planning for the future, focusing on continuous \nimprovement, which again agrees to Islamic notion of developing Insan-e-kamil \u2013 a \ncomplete person (Siddiqui 1998:1), and fits well within the frame of haqook-al-abaad \nand haqook-Allah. These developing concepts are moving towards a blurring of \nboundaries between leader\/teacher, led\/leaders, and internal-to-school\/external-to-school, \na position taken by Islamic philosophy of education, as discussed above:  \nDoes this point to the need to reconstruct the notions of leadership, drawing from diverse \nperspectives?  \nDoes this indicate the significance of perspectives formulated within multi-ethnic \ncommunities (i.e. Muslin Ummah), and to \u201elook analytically at those different conditions \nof production of theory and assess how far \u2026 [these] insights are transferable to our \nsituation\u201f (Robbin 2004:429)? \n 22 \n \nConclusion: overlaps in conceptual frameworks of educational leadership \nThere is no denying the tensions across conflicting ideological positions and concepts, but \nthis does not negate working towards increased understanding. An understanding of the \nfactors influencing Islamic notions of leadership, and of other perspectives, can be useful \nfor inclusiveness, particularly in the wake of increasing assumptions and misconceptions \nraging across the historic divide of Muslim\/non-Muslim hindering understanding and \ncausing concerns in multi-ethnic societies like Britain (Convay 1997). Research confirms \nthat in the educational institutions, assumptions about Muslims and their socio-cultural \npractices tend to influence attitudes and practices towards the Muslim staff and students, \naffecting their achievement and performance (Abbas 2002; Connolly & Troyna 1998; Haw \n1998; Mac an Ghaill 1994; Osler 1997; 2003; Parker-Jenkins 1995; Rakhit 1998). The \nperformance and progression issues of the Muslim students and the staff in Britain are \nincreasingly being perceived as leadership issues. The assimilation approaches practised \nin schools as a reaction and response to increased immigration in the post-second-world-\nwar scenario complicated the leadership-management of \u201emulti-ethnic\u201f schools by \ncamouflaging the real issues.  \n \nThe emerging leadership concepts reflect genuine efforts to restructure leadership in a \nrealistic context, based on an acknowledgement and celebration of diversity, \ncorresponding to Islamic philosophy and may be to many others. An Islamic leadership \nperspective is not a matter of notional constructions of \u201eknowledge-givers\u201f through \nreligious texts and discourses. It is a quintessence of all those principles and values \nassociated with the \u201erighteous path\u201f, and which have high value for the Muslims. These \nconcepts have a bearing on the attitudes, code of conduct, behaviour and demeanour of \neducational leaders in the Muslim societies. A model educational leader, from the \nMuslims\u201f perspective has to be value-conscious irrespective of the fact to what extent do \nthey follow that path themselves (Jacobson 1998). Islam celebrates diversity (The Quran \n49:13), and declares that faith can not be imposed by force. Coming from this philosophical \nposition, the Muslim students and community would understand differences of culture and \nfaith, but they would expect the leaders to live up to a value model to command that respect \n 23 \nand relationship which, in Islam, forms the basis of teaching and leading. The \u201esense-\nmaking agenda\u201f suggested by Tim Simkins draws attention to the emerging contexts and \nassociated needs by highlighting the need for \u201emaking sense\u201f of:  \n \n the ways in which leadership itself is conceived; \n the role and purposes of the organization within a dynamic and conflictual \npolicy environment; \n the ways in which leadership roles are changing and should change; \n the ways in which power and authority are and should be constituted and \ndistributed in educational organizations; \n \u201eother worlds\u201f across inter-professional and organizational boundaries; \nand  \n using leadership development to understand sense-making itself. \n \nLeadership perspectives are not fixed entities. These evolve and develop, although the \nnature and scope of change may vary from context to context. Even within Muslim \nsocieties there are considerable variations in practice over time and across regional \ncultures (Siddique 1998), in spite of a shared philosophical base. Across philosophical \nand other divides, differences might be more pronounced in practice, but a base of shared \nhuman values can guide to resolve tensions, not by eliminating differences, but by \nrespecting and integrating conflicting philosophies and concepts. A pre-requisite is \ncommunication and, according to Hofstede, ccommunication across cultures \u201estimulates \nreflection and reorientation\u201f (2001: 390), which may mean a reorientation of leadership \ntheory in the case of educational leadership, moving towards construction of a leadership \nmodel to the satisfaction of component groups in multicultural institutions. We certainly \nneed complex theoretical constructs to reconfigure and re-conceptualize leadership in \ncomplex contexts. This paper argues for engaging with, and drawing from, diverse \nsources to enrich theory and practice and to develop leadership model to meet the \nchallenges of changing population structures in schools, and suggests engagement with \ndiverse leadership perspectives to work towards that goal. \n \n 24 \nAgenda for Research into Islamic Educational Leadership in Britain \nIn spite of a large Muslim population in Britain, research into Islamic Educational \nLeadership remains a neglected field, as in many other countries. In the emerging multi-\ncultural multi-faith societies, with the surfacing of a global wave of religious resurgence, \nthe need to enhance knowledge and understanding of diverse communities gains extreme \nsignificance, particularly to maintain social stability and harmony that contribute to \neducational engagement. This places tremendous responsibility on educational leaders \nwho are expected to provide not just the future work force but also the future citizens \nwith respect for plurality and diversity of values perspectives. As I argue elsewhere (Shah \n2006), lack of understanding and lack of respect for diversity can create a context of \nconflict and resentment that may ultimately contribute to occurrences like 9\/11 and 7\/7. \nEducational leaders and researchers have responsibility to develop a knowledge base that \ncan improve mutual understanding and respect. In the case of Muslim community, a basic \nresearch agenda may focus on building that knowledge base by exploring: \n Quranic philosophy of education \u2013 towards making education a positive \nexperience \n Teacher\/leader and knowledge status in Islam and its implications for \nteaching\/learning \n Conceptualisations of educational leadership in Muslim and non-Muslim \ncommunities\/ societies \n Muslim learners\u201f expectations of educational Leadership in Britain \n Experiencing Muslimness in educational institutions in Britain \n Muslim learners\u201f perceptions of leadership, and leadership perceptions of \nMuslim learners: the interplay \n Faith, citizenship and education  \n \nThe world has moved on from \u201eone-nation country\u201f scenario, and in today\u201fs multiply \ndiverse global village the issue is to learn how to live together. The only long term \neffective option appears to be to enhance knowledge and understanding, and this brings \nthe focus back to further research. No doubt there are, and will be, issues of how and who \n 25 \nand what in research, challenging ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies. But \neven if we don\u201ft agree on any answers, at least the questions raised will make us all think. \n \n \nAcknowledgements:  \nThank you to colleagues for their very useful comments, and support, in developing this \npaper. \n \nBibliography: \nAbbas, T.

The \nroot word of Ummah is umm which means 'mother' in Arabic (Ahmed 1992). In the first chapter of  'Ummah or Nation', \nDr. Al-Ahsan (1992) discusses the Quranic concept of Ummah, referring to the sixty-four occurrences of the term in the \nQuran. Commonly, this term is used among Muslims to convey the fact that all Muslims the world over constitute one \nummah or community (see also Geaves 1996 (chapters II and III); Iqbal 1996). \n3 Some discussions in Al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee, Al-Kind\u00ee and Ibn Rushd can help to understand these debates. \n4 This concept of education for all forms the basis of Islamic philosophy of education, while in many early societies \naccess to education has been limited. For example in early church schools, education was limited to clergymen and \nlandlords (Murphy, 1971), while in the pre-Islamic India education was the privilege of the Brahmins, and only restricted \nlearnings (three Rs) were permitted to Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, completely excluding the Sudras (Haq 1954; Miller 1968).  \n5 The two point agenda of \u201eeducation for all\u201f and \u201elifelong learning\u201f which is increasingly gaining credibility in the \ndeveloped world. \n6 One of the five pillars of Islam, and a highly contested concept, which essentially stands for struggle in Islam. The \ntwo major terms associated with it are: 'Jihad bil-Ilm', which means effort through knowledge; and 'Jihad bil-Saif' \nwhich signifies the 'defense of Islam\u201f, where 'saif' literally means sword. Jihad in all its forms symbolises a struggle for \nthe \u201eright\u201f, valuable than one's own life, and carries promises of highest reward. See also Christie 1991; Nielsen 1992). \n7 There are examples of the Mohammed's (the prophet in Islam) insistence for the Muslims to pursue knowledge \nwherever they find it  'even to the borders of China'  (Ashraf 1995).  \n8 The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \u201eWhomsoever Allah intends to do good, He gives right understanding of \nreligion, and knowledge is maintained only through teaching.\u201f (Hadith Bukhari in A Manual of Hadith by Maulana \nMuhammad Ali). \n 9 'Sijda' (bowing the head) in the Islamic context is the ultimate mark of respect and obedience, and except this one \nreference in the Quran, due only to God. \n10 The interrogative expression is often used in the Quran for emphasis.  \n11 Some prophets named in the Quran as having been given knowledge are Noah, David, Solomon, Moses (28:24), \nJoseph (12:22), and Jacob (12:68). \n12 For details see Hussain and Ashraf 1997: \u201eThe Teacher and the Taught\u201f, and Iqbal 1996:61-111. \n 13 Later, the situation underwent changes as Islam spread into further areas, and interacted with different religions, and \nsocio-economic backgrounds. Al-Azhar was the first formal seat of learning established in Egypt in the fourth century, \nand was followed by Al-Nizamiyyah in Baghdad, where state-paid teachers were appointed (Tibawi 1972:30). \n14 Ulema have traditionally commanded high respect and status in Muslim societies due to their knowledge, but there has \nbeen an increasing dissatisfaction with their knowledge claims in the present times. \n15 Religious knowledge, broadly speaking, includes knowledge of the sacred texts, and knowledge about the pillars of \nthe religion, the articles of faith, and the Shari'ah. \n16 Believing and obeying the Quranic teachings is a part of faith for Muslims. \n17 Schools run by \u201eNahlatul Ulama\u201f (Educational Management News, Issue 22, Jan 2004, p 13. \n18 Cheng (2002) lists five dimensions of leadership \u2013 human, structural, political, cultural and educational \u2013 developed \nfrom Boleman and Deal\u201fs (1997) four leadership functions, and Sergiovanni\u201fs (1984) model of five leadership forces - \n- technical, human, educational, symbolic, and cultural leadership, which point to the scope and depth of leadership \nconcepts. \n19 Davies and Davies define wisdom as \u201ethe capacity to take the right action at the right time\u201f (2004:35) - a simple \ndefinition which can absorb multiple interpretations. \n20 In Islamic philosophy, God is \u201ethe Knowing\u201f, \u201ethe Wise\u201f (4:11; 4:24; 4:92; 4:111; 4:170; 6:83; 6:139; 8:71; 9:15; \n12:100; 15:25; 22:52; 33:1 and many others). Human leadership is justified in the Quran on the basis of human beings \npartaking these Godly attributes of \u201ethe Knowing\u201f and \u201ethe Wise\u201f. \n21 A highly diverse community, extending beyond the variables like race, \u201eethnicity\u201f, colour, language, dress, and \nothers. \n"}
