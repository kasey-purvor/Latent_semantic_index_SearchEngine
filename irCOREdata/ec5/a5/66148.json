This study of Isabel of\nAragon (c. 1270\u20131336 ), wife of King Dinis of Portugal (1279\u20131325), who was venerated as a saint from\nshortly after her death, aims to explore the relationship between Isabel\u2019s queenship and her sainthood. It\nengages with recent research, and critiques obvious comparisons between Isabel and her great-aunt St\nElizabeth of Thuringia. Isabel may also be compared with numerous other medieval European queens and\nher main vita displays striking similarities to royal courtesy literature found elsewhere.\nO n 26 March 1612 witnesses watched the opening of a tomb in theFranciscan nunnery of Santa Clara in Coimbra, Portugal. One ofthem later described the condition of the body found inside:\ndespite being nearly three hundred years old, the sainted body was whole, the face\nnoble, the hair golden and still attached to the skin, the arm and right hand entire,\nthe nails as if they were of a living person ... and in the features of the face there was\ngreat similarity to the effigy that we see on the tomb.1\nMedical practitioners in attendance confirmed the body\u2019s lack of corruption;\nGonc\u00b8alo Dias, chief surgeon of Coimbra, remarked: \u2018I feel for certain that it is\nbeyond natural order for a body to be somany years without decay, which can\nonly be miraculous. \u20192 Whose was this miraculous body and why did it arouse\nsomuch interest? The tombwas that of Isabel of Aragon, wife of KingDinis of\nPortugal (1279\u20131325), who had indeed died nearly three hundred years earlier\non 4 July 1336, and the tomb-opening was part of a long-drawn-out process\nthat eventually led to her canonisation on 25 May 1625. Known as the Rainha\nSanta, Isabel is venerated as Portugal\u2019s only officially canonised royal saint.\nThe cult of Isabel of Aragon first came to my attention in the context of\nwider research on the relationship between medicine and religion in late\n1 A.

Physicians were involved in various aspects of Isabel\u2019s\ncult, as evidenced by the descriptions of her body in 1612, and Isabel had\nattributed to her a number of healing miracles of medical interest. It\nbecame apparent that before much progress could be made on the medical\naspects of the cult, it would be necessary to explore both the cult and Isabel\u2019s\nlife in more detail. Hagiography has only relatively recently become a serious\nsubject of investigation in Portugal, and there is very little interest in\nqueenship.3 In contrast, these fields have developed elsewhere by leaps and\nbounds. Once scarcely studied at all, queens are now seen as powerful\nindividuals with a major stake in the political process of their husbands\u2019\nrealms.4 Similarly the creation of royal saints\u2019 cults is now viewed as an\nintrinsic part of dynastic power-building, and the saints themselves represent\na distinct form of medieval spirituality.5 It therefore seemed that the time was\nright to embark on a study of Isabel\u2019s sainthood and queenship, making use\nof new scholarship.\nApplying this scholarship to a Portuguese queen has proved surprisingly\ndifficult. The early fourteenth century is one of the least-known periods in\nIberian history and the whole issue of Iberian sainthood is problematic.\nHistorians argue that there was no tradition of sacral kingship similar to that\nwhich created royal cults elsewhere, and note that few Iberian saints were\npapally recognised during the Middle Ages.6 Further research reveals that\nIsabel of Aragon was far from being the only Portuguese royal saint, but if\nthese monarchs lacked the quasi-sacral qualities of northern, that is English\nor French, monarchy \u2013 remaining largely uncrowned, unanointed and laying\nno claim to healing powers \u2013 how did they become saints?7 It is clear\nthat much needs to be done on this subject. There has at least been some\n3 F. F. de la Figanie`re, Memorias das rainhas de Portugal : D. Teresa \u2013 Santa Isabel, Lisbon 1859,\nhas not been superseded.

The two historians whose work is particularly relevant\nare Gabor Klaniczay, who studies the saintly princesses of central Europe,\nand Jo Ann MacNamara, who has explored the careers of early medieval\nsaint-queens.9 The career of Isabel of Aragon is rarely considered outside the\nIberian peninsula, passing only fleetingly through some of the literature,10\nyet she is an example of queenly sainthood from a later period than\nthat studied by MacNamara, and she offers a parallel perspective from a\ndifferent part of Europe to that studied by Klaniczay. An exploration of\nIsabel\u2019s life and cult provides an opportunity to examine current ideas on\nqueenship and sainthood using a less well-known figure as a kind of\nlitmus test.\nIsabel was born in c. 1270 to Pere III of Aragon (Pere II of Catalonia)\nand Constance Hohenstaufen (see Figures 7, 8 below). Through her father\nshe was a great-niece of Elizabeth of Hungary or Thuringia (d. 1231), one of\nthe most influential saints of the late Middle Ages. In 1281\/2 Isabel married\nDinis of Portugal. Although his reign is often viewed as the high point of\nthe Portuguese Middle Ages, it was marred by civil war in 1319\u201323 between\nDinis and his favoured illegitimate son Afonso Sanches on the one side,\nand Isabel and her son, the future Afonso IV (1325\u201357), on the other.\nIt is usually said that consequently Isabel\u2019s was an unhappy marriage.\nThe couple had two children: Afonso (born 1291) and Constanc\u00b8a (born 1290),\nthe latter marrying Fernando IV of Castile (1295\u20131312) in 1302 and dying\nshortly after him in 1313, leaving a baby son Alfonso XI (1312\u201350).\nThe successive minorities experienced by Castile during this period\n8 T.

From her surviving letters\nto her brother Jaume II of Aragon (1285\u20131327), we know that Isabel arranged\nmarriages, intervened in legal cases and occupied herself with her family in\nCastile, Aragon and Portugal. A few days before Dinis died in January 1325,\nIsabel declared that she would not be buried next to him in his Cistercian\nfoundation near Lisbon, but would lie in her own Franciscan foundation\nof Santa Clara in Coimbra. On 8 January, the day after Dinis died,\nIsabel took the Franciscan habit (though she did not profess as a nun) and\ndevoted the rest of her life to Santa Clara. She seems to have lived in\nretirement there as a widow, so it is surprising that on 4 July 1336 death found\nher many miles away in Estremoz near the border with Castile, perhaps\ninvolved in negotiations between Afonso IV of Portugal and Alfonso XI of\nCastile.11\nIsabel\u2019s body was brought back to Santa Clara for burial and within\ndays miracle cures were reported. A Franciscan inquiry was set up to\ninvestigate them, and the state of Isabel\u2019s body, which had not decomposed\ndespite the journey across the hot Alentejo plains. Both in 1336 and later\nin 1612 when Isabel\u2019s tomb was opened, the preservation of her corpse\nwould count as evidence for her sanctity. The historian luckily has\naccess to one of the original notarial documents pertaining to this early\ninquiry.12 Otherwise, though, we are dependent on Isabel\u2019s main vita,\nwhich survives only in a late sixteenth-century copy belonging to Santa\nClara of an early fifteenth-century copy of the original written in c. 1340.13\nThis vita is accepted as genuine and, although it is anonymous, is usually\nattributed to Salvado Martins OFM, bishop of Lamego, one of Isabel\u2019s\nexecutors, who appears to have headed the inquiry into her miracles.14\n11 N.

I hope to discuss the\nthorny issue of authorship elsewhere.\n16 Nunes, \u2018Vida e milagres \u2019, divided the vita into the following chapters : 1, 3\u20136: childhood,\nmarriage, journey to Portugal ; 7-(13) : early years of marriage, children, husband\u2019s infidelities,\nintervention in dispute between Dinis and brother, involvement in arbitration of Castilian-\nAragonese conflict, son\u2019s marriage ; 14\u201316: civil war ; 17\u201322: charitable activity during\nmarriage ; 23\u201331, 33 : widowhood, pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, construction of\nSanta Clara, liturgical routine, later charitable work; 34, 36: death and corpse\u2019s journey to\nCoimbra; 2, 32, 35: genealogy; 37\u201345: eight miracles recorded in 1336; 46: miracle dated\n1337 ; 47\u201351: five in vita miracles ; 52\u20138: six posthumous miracles. The Bollandists divided the\nsame material into thirteen chapters comprising one hundred and thirty-one sections. I hope\nto deal with this problematic structure elsewhere.\nI SABEL OF ARAGON : MODEL QUEEN OR MODEL SA INT? 673\nThe relationships between these works and the main vita require\nthorough analysis that cannot be carried out here, but it is worth noting\nthat one of the offices and the short vita were both dedicated to Queen\nCaterina (d. 1578), sister of the Emperor Charles V and wife of Joa\u02dco III of\nPortugal (1521\u201357) ; relevant when assessing the long-term influence of\nIsabel\u2019s cult.17\nThe title to this paper seems to establish a dichotomy between model\nqueenship and model sainthood, whereas historians usually view them as\nclosely related ideals. For example, it is clear from medieval iconography\nand literature that the perfect queen and the perfect female saint throughout\nthis period was the Virgin Mary, and that in official documents and\nhagiographical writings numerous women articulated their identities, powers\nand aspirations, or had them articulated for them, with reference to Marian\nimagery.18 It is also undeniable that some of the earliest female saints\n(after the martyrdoms of the early Church) were royal wives, like Bertha\nof Kent or Clotilde of Merovingian Gaul, who were able to intercede\nsuccessfully between their pagan husbands and Christian missionaries, and\nthat throughout the Middle Ages queens appear to have practised charity\nand interceded politically in increasingly ritualised ceremonies in imitation of\nthese earlier models. This is the theory put forward by Jo Ann MacNamara,\namongst others, who argues that sainthood thus became an attribute of\nqueenship, although the idea does leave threads hanging.19 First in that\nMacNamara\u2019s model saint-queen died out in the mid-thirteenth century, as\nChristendom ceased to expand and absorb non-Christian peoples, which\nleaves Isabel of Aragon high and dry.20 Second, the model does not recognise\nthat intercession was an active role of queens long before Christianity, as\nattested by the biblical figure of Esther, often used prior to the thirteenth\ncentury in preference to Marian images of queenly authority.21 Queenliness\nand saintliness are therefore not such obvious companions as one might\nthink, and their early relationship demands further investigation.\nThere is here a gender relationship peculiar to a particular time in history.\nThere were very few female saints in the early Middle Ages and most of them\n17 Cro\u00b4nica de Portugal de 1419, ed.

The only married women who\nachieved sainthood before the late Middle Ages were queens. Even when the\nsituation changed later, encouraging veneration of married lower status\nwomen like Bridget of Sweden (d. 1373) or Dorothy of Montau (d. 1394), there\ncontinued to be an ambivalence towards chastity and child-bearing, an\nambivalence that queens, whose main function was to produce an heir, to\nsome extent escaped. In order to achieve sainthood an individual had to have\na certain amount of visibility in society,22 and also, in accordance with the\nseminal ideas of Peter Brown concerning the holy man, had to be in a liminal\nposition within a community yet also be a figure of power able to intercede\nbetween the community and the outside world. There has been some debate\nover whether these ideas can be applied to holy women, but certainly the\nonly visible women were queens or royal abbesses in the early Middle Ages,\nand queens in particular, often as foreigners of a different faith in their\nhusband\u2019s courts, certainly fulfilled Brown\u2019s criteria for holy intercessors.23\nIt might be more accurate to argue that instead of sainthood being an\nattribute of queenship, hagiographers and others saw queenship as an\nintegral part of sainthood. Queens were simply more likely to become saints\nthan other women. However, although most European queens appear to\nhave behaved in similar ways throughout the Middle Ages relatively few\nbecame saints. Why this was the case? Did queens aspire to be saints or good\nqueens? How were they viewed by their contemporaries and by subsequent\ngenerations : why were some queens remembered as saints, and others as\nJezebels? It is generally understood that political, social and geographical\nfactors have as much to do with sainthood as does behaviour, but it is not\nclear whether this understanding has been applied to the saint-queen. The\nargument presented here is that since there were few saint-queens in\nmedieval Europe, but many queens, all requiring training and advice of some\nkind, there was surely a model of good queenship that need not have\nanything at all to do with sainthood.\nThere were only a few guides to queenship circulating in medieval\nEurope.24 The Siete partidas of Alfonso X of Castile, a law code compiled in the\n1260s, is rather limited in its description of the queen\u2019s role. It describes the\nselection of the king\u2019s wife and his relationship with her, placing great\nemphasis on her lineage and good habits, her role in the education and\n22 J.

The only advice on religious behaviour is the recommendation that\nprincesses learn to read the Hours and the Psalter.25 Another key work is\nChristine de Pizan\u2019s Treasure of the city of ladies written in 1405 as a guide for the\nyoung bride of the French dauphin. Here the princess is supposed to nurture\nthe good-will of her husband\u2019s people, keep the peace and not take sides in\ndisputes, take care of her husband\u2019s physical and spiritual health, even if he\nhas affairs, dispense charity in secret, keep women of good repute around\nher, take pains with her children\u2019s education and work hard to support the\nheir once widowed.26 Notably, Christine believed that Elizabeth of Hungary\nwas a saint in spite of her queenly status not because of it. A pious princess\ncould become a saint but it was not the goal of her career and certainly not an\nattribute of her royal status ; most queens would be lucky even to get into\nheaven in Christine\u2019s view.27\nIt is clear from a brief summary of these two texts that the life of the ideal\nqueen was similar in many ways to the life of Isabel of Aragon as recorded in\nher vita. Since the Siete partidas was known in Portugal and Isabel\u2019s husband\nDinis consciously modelled himself on his grandfather Alfonso X, it is possible\nthat this legal code influenced Isabel.28 As for Christine de Pizan\u2019s work,\nalthough it obviously could not have influenced Isabel herself, it is uncanny\nhow close Christine\u2019s advice is to Isabel\u2019s experience. Subsequently, the\nTreasure of the city of ladies became well-known in Portugal after another Isabel\n(d. 1472), daughter of Joa\u02dco I (1385\u20131433), admired the work when she became\nduchess of Burgundy in 1430, and sent it to her niece, also Isabel, queen of\nPortugal (d. 1455), who had it translated into Portuguese. It was eventually\npublished as the Espelho de Cristina in 1518 at the instigation of Queen Leonor\n(d. 1525), widow of Joa\u02dco II (1481\u201395).29 There is thus firm evidence that this\ncourtesy manual influenced Portuguese royal women, though it is not yet\npossible to show whether early-modern queens were aware of the similarities\nbetween the Espelho and the Isabelline hagiography also produced in a royal\ncontext in the mid-sixteenth century.\nPart of the problem with these texts is that there are not enough\ncomparative studies of Iberian and northern queenship or sainthood to allow\nmore accurate judgement of Isabel\u2019s activity. Two possible avenues will be\nexplored here. First, comparison will be made between Isabel of Aragon and\n25 Vann, \u2018Theory and practice of medieval Castilian queenship\u2019, 126\u20137; Alfonso X, Las siete\npartidas, trans. S. P.

Second, comparison will be made between Isabel\nand the most influential female royal saints of the period, those of Hungary\nstudied by Klaniczay. If there were a model of saintly behaviour followed by\nIsabel and\/or her hagiographer then we would expect to find it coming from\nthis direction.\nSince Isabel of Aragon was the great-niece of St Elizabeth of Hungary, it is\neasy to assume that she modelled herself on her kinswoman and aspired to\njoin the wider Hungarian pantheon of saints. Indeed, Hungarian observers\nreadily included Isabel in this blessed company. In 1307 the bishop of Zagreb\ngave a speech to the Hungarian nobility in favour of the candidature\nto the Hungarian throne of the Angevin prince Charles Robert (d. 1342),\ndescendant like Isabel of Andrew II of Hungary, in which he argued that\nCharles\u2019s right to the throne was based on his saintly lineage. He listed\nElizabeth of Hungary, Isabel of Aragon, Margaret (d. 1270) and Cunegond\n(d. 1292) (Elizabeth of Hungary\u2019s saintly nieces), Louis of Anjou, Franciscan\nbishop of Toulouse (d. 1297) and Louis IX of France (d. 1270), as the most\nimportant of the many saints found in the late medieval Hungarian-Capetian\ndynastic network.30 Hungarian historians have recently cast doubts on the\nauthenticity of this speech, not least because Isabel of Aragon was still alive in\n1307.31 However, it is an indication that at some point Isabel was recognised\nas belonging to the Hungarian saints\u2019 \u2018club\u2019.\nThe problem is that we need to understand Isabel within an Iberian\ncontext, not a Hungarian one. Undoubtedly Isabel\u2019s hagiographer was aware\nof some of these northern saints since he or she claimed that Isabel had been\nnamed after her great-aunt, and also referred to her kinship with Louis of\nToulouse.32 There is no mention though of other Hungarian saints, nor of\nLouis IX of France, despite the fact that he was first cousin to Isabel\u2019s father-\nin-law, Afonso III of Portugal. It is not clear whether Isabel\u2019s relationship to\nElizabeth and Louis was meant to be dynastic, saintly or indeed Franciscan.\nElizabeth is usually seen as a Franciscan saint, although she had no\nreal affiliation to any religious order during her lifetime; Louis gave up\nthe Angevin kingship in order to become a friar ; and Isabel supported the\nFranciscans in a country where royal patronage usually focused on the\nCistercians. Since Isabel\u2019s cult developed in a Franciscan context, this theory\nhas weight. On the other hand, the vita has a strongly dynastic flavour,\nincluding lists of Isabel\u2019s relatives that have much more to do with Aragon\n30 Klaniczay, Holy rulers, 324\u20135.\n31 Ibid. ; cf. idem, The uses of supernatural power : the transformation of popular religion in medieval and\nearly-modern Europe, trans.

For example, Dinis\u2019s grandfather, Alfonso X of Castile,\nappears because he married Isabel\u2019s aunt Violant, he helped Jaume I \u2018 the\nConqueror\u2019 of Aragon conquer Murcia from the Moors and he was the son\nof Fernando III of Castile \u2018who conquered Seville \u2019.33 Louis of Toulouse was\nmentioned because Isabel\u2019s sister Violant married his brother Robert of\nNaples. Portuguese royal saints, such as Dinis\u2019s own great-aunt Teresa, have\nno place at all in the vita, suggesting that sainthood as such was not the model\nfollowed here.34 Lineage probably was a key element in Isabel\u2019s sainthood,\nbut it was an especial Iberian dynastic mystique built on conquest and\npersonal prestige, not on kinship to other European saints.\nTurning to Isabel\u2019s pious behaviour in her vita, there do appear to be\nsimilarities between her life and that of Elizabeth of Hungary.35 It can be\nargued that to some extent their behaviour is partly formulaic, knowingly\nbased around the Seven Acts of Mercy. It is not necessarily the case that\nIsabel was imitating Elizabeth; both women could have been conforming to\na standard model of piety that informed the charitable work of numerous\nEuropean women, and men, who supported religious houses and provided\npoor relief. It is also recognised that hagiographers copied motifs from one\nsaint\u2019s life to another. Isabel\u2019s most famous miracle, in which her charitable\ngiving is concealed from her husband by alms turning into roses, cannot be\nfound before the sixteenth century and derives from an apocryphal story told\nabout Elizabeth from the second half of the thirteenth century.36 There are\nfurther parallels between the lives of Isabel and Elizabeth. Both women were\nforeigners in their husbands\u2019 lands and suffered periods of dispossession and\nexile. They were wives and mothers who endeavoured to lead pious lives\nwhile married but were liberated by widowhood. However, these similarities\nare outweighed by some significant differences. In contrast to Isabel,\nElizabeth had a loving relationship with her husband, though she later\nrejected her children, and she engaged in a variety of mystical and self-\nmortifying acts under the guidance of her harsh spiritual advisor Conrad of\n33 Ibid. 173, 174, 189.\n34 B.

Finally, the most important difference between\nthese women was the political influence wielded by Isabel as queen. It is in\nthis context that comparison between Isabel and the central European\nprincesses studied by Klaniczay is less meaningful.\nThere is no consensus amongst historians as to what constituted queenly\npower and whether it increased or declined during the Middle Ages, but by\nwhatever criteria one uses, Isabel of Aragon was a powerful figure in\nfourteenth-century Iberia.39 Few of the central European women studied by\nKlaniczay, on the other hand, were able to exercise much political power,\nand those who did usually suffered the consequences ; Gertrude of Meran, St\nElizabeth\u2019s mother, was murdered for her political interference in 1213.40\nPrincesses like Elizabeth and her niece Margaret of Hungary were essentially\npowerless, whether this was the fate dealt out to them by fathers and\nbrothers, or the result of their own submission to rigid spiritual regimes.\nIronically, the saintly reputations this lifestyle created were indeed\nempowering, enabling some princesses later to intervene in dynastic\ndisputes.41 The dynastic cults maintained by the descendants of these\nwomen were also politically powerful.42 All this suggests that comparison\nbetween royal saints from different parts of Europe has to take into account\ncontrasting political systems, and differing relationships between spiritual\nand secular powers. Further comparison of the cults in question could be\nuseful, but the Hungarian context should not be pursued to the detriment of\nthe Portuguese.\nIf we focus on the Portuguese context, it does in fact become clear that\nElizabeth meant something to Isabel. First, there is the evidence of Isabel\u2019s\ntomb in Santa Clara, designed according to her specifications as part of the\nconstruction work on the nunnery (see Figures 3\u20136).

It\ntherefore seems that Franciscan and dynastic ideals were woven together in\nthe queen\u2019s projection of her self-identity.43 Secondly, there is documentary\nevidence that Isabel venerated her great-aunt. In a codicil of her will of 1327\nshe founded a hospital near Santa Clara de Coimbra dedicated to her, and\nSanta Clara itself was dedicated to both Clare and Elizabeth.44 Elizabeth\u2019s\ncult was popular in Aragon in the late thirteenth century,45 but virtually\nunknown in Portugal before Isabel arrived in 1282, so it would appear that\n\u00a9Iona McCleery 2002\nFigure 3.

It is not clear when\nthe dedication of the new foundation was decided; its first stone was not\nformally laid until 1286, but a community of women already seems to have\nbeen living on the site by then. There is no evidence that Isabel was involved\nin the foundation until after Mo\u00b4r\u2019s death in 1302, by which time Santa Cruz\nhad won its case and Isabel had to re-found the nunnery in 1314. It is possible\nthat Mo\u00b4r Dias founded the nunnery in honour of the new queen and her\ndynastic saint. Mo\u00b4r\u2019s sister, Joana, and brother-in-law, Ferna\u02dco Fernandes\nCogominho, were prominent members of the royal court who would\nhave informed Mo\u00b4r about Isabel\u2019s religious preferences. Also, one of the\nprocurators responsible for bringing Isabel to Portugal, Joa\u02dco Martins de\nSoalha\u02dces (d. 1325), later bishop of Lisbon and finally archbishop of Braga, was\n\u00a9Iona McCleery 2002\nFigure 4.

Isabel\u2019s period of widowhood spent in\nSanta Clara is the least studied period of her life, and the flourishing of her\ncult until the present day depended on local political and religious forces that\nrequire further investigation.\nAs can be seen from the family trees (see Figures 7, 8), it is possible to compare\nIsabel of Aragon to numerous European queens; however, only a few can\nbe discussed here. Firstly, consider Isabel\u2019s Aragonese family. Her mother\nConstance (d. 1300), founded and lived in a Franciscan nunnery in Sicily after\nshe was widowed, left money in her will to found Franciscan hospitals in\nBarcelona and Valencia and was eventually buried in the Franciscan habit in\n\u00a9Iona McCleery 2002\nFigure 5.

With her husband, Robert of Naples, Sancia supported the\nSpiritual Franciscans against the pope and deeply venerated Elizabeth of\nHungary as a dynastic saint ; both Sancia and Robert were descended from\nthe Hungarian royal family. After Robert\u2019s death, Sancia ruled Naples as\nregent for his grand-daughter Joanna, became a Franciscan nun in 1344, and\nwas eventually buried in her own foundation, Santa Chiara of Naples.\nJoanna later wrote to the pope claiming that Sancia\u2019s body had been found\nincorrupt. No pope could countenance a saint who had worked so hard to\noppose papal policy but Joanna\u2019s belief that Sancia was a saint may have\nbeen shared by others, suggesting another complex relationship between\nqueenship and sainthood.50\nTurning to Castile, we can compare Isabel to her aunt Violant, wife of\nAlfonso X (d. 1300), to Isabel\u2019s own mother-in-law Beatriz de Guille\u00b4n (d.\n1303), Alfonso\u2019s illegitimate daughter, and to Violant\u2019s daughter-in-law\nMaria de Molina (d. 1321), wife of Sancho IV. Violant and Beatriz intervened\nin the civil war of the early 1280s between Alfonso X and the future Sancho IV,\nwhich is similar to the Portuguese civil war of forty years later.51 Maria de\nMolina (d. 1321) ruled Castile during the minorities of her son Fernando IV\nand grandson Alfonso XI in the early fourteenth century, and is mentioned\nseveral times in Isabel\u2019s vita and in her correspondence.52 It is to be hoped\nthat future work on Iberian queens will investigate the lives of these women\nfurther, revealing the complex political and cultural network that links them\ntogether.\nIsabel can also be compared to the queens of England. It is not surprising\nthat parallels can be found with the lives of Eleanor of Provence (d. 1291), wife\nof Henry III (1217\u201372), or Eleanor of Castile (d. 1290), wife of Edward I\n(1272\u20131307), since they came from worlds not that far removed from\nPortugal.53 A more unexpected comparison can be made with Isabella of\nFrance (d. 1358), wife of Edward II (1307\u201327) and Isabel of Aragon\u2019s first\ncousin once removed. Isabella acted as diplomat in negotiations between\nFrance and England; became involved in a rebellion in 1326\u20137 that closely\nresembles the Portuguese civil war of a few years earlier ; largely retired from\ncourt life after her son Edward III came to power in 1330; and eventually\nchose to be buried in Greyfriars, London, rather than in the more usual\nWestminster Abbey.

England and France\nwere long-term rivals as Aragon and Portugal never were so it is likely that\nthis determined the queens\u2019 careers from the beginning. However, the\nrelationships between the women and their sons were also crucial. Afonso IV\nof Portugal, a mature married man, could have been disinherited by Dinis if\nit had not been for his mother\u2019s help, whereas the teenage Edward III\u2019s\nposition in relation to his mother and her co-conspirator Roger Mortimer\nwas more ambiguous.55 Further comparison between these two queens would\nilluminate the processes behind the construction of royal power and\nreputation.\nTeresa Vann, in her study of Castilian queenship, argues that thirteenth-\ncentury queens remained closely tied to the interests of their kin and that\ntheir power depended on their own family background.56 This is certainly\nborne out by the careers of all the queens described here. Isabel of Aragon\u2019s\nletters indicate that her ties to Aragon were of paramount importance, and\nthat her Aragonese identity underpinned her power in Portugal. Her\nmarriage to Dinis can be explained by the need to counterbalance Castilian\naggression in the peninsula, and her ability to intercede with her husband\nwas based on the prestige of the well-established house of Barcelona rather\nthan on the dubious power granted by her husband\u2019s dynasty. After all, when\nDinis and Isabel married he was the excommunicate son of a bigamous\nusurper. This being the case, it is likely that models of queenly behaviour\nwere learned within the birth family, probably passed down from mother to\ndaughter. Indeed, the Siete partidas of Alfonso X emphasise the queen\u2019s\nresponsibility for the education of her daughters. Even where children were\nextremely small when they left home \u2013 Isabel became responsible for her\ndaughter-in-law when she was four \u2013 mothers-in-law, often relatives\nthemselves, were effective substitutes. Very few of the women discussed\nhere came to be viewed as saints, but they all behaved in remarkably similar\nways as queens and this must be because there was a standard form of\nbehaviour that they learned as children.\n54 S.

Was it done through imitation and personal example, or through\nformal training and textual guidance? It is possible that intercessory rituals\nundergone by new English queens may have been training sessions, and\nthere are traces of a similar episode placed early in Isabel\u2019s career in the vita.57\nPondering this possible textual example, leads one to consider what may\nhave been behind the writing of Isabel of Aragon\u2019s vita. The saint whom\nIsabel most closely resembles is not Elizabeth of Hungary, but Margaret (d.\n1093), Anglo-Saxon wife of Malcolm Canmore of Scotland. Margaret\u2019s vita,\nusually attributed to her confessor Turgot, prior of Durham and later bishop\nof St Andrews, is strikingly similar to Isabel\u2019s. Both works describe close links\nto religious houses whose fortunes are tied up in the queen\u2019s reputation\n(Dunfermline Abbey in Margaret\u2019s case), concern with children, similar\nliturgical routines, very few demeaning acts of piety and examples of secret\nacts of charity. Ironically there is even a link to Hungary since Margaret was\nborn there.58 Spiritually Isabel has far more in common with Margaret than\nshe has with the mystical saints of the fourteenth century; hers is a much\nmore old-fashioned type of sainthood. It is also a more old-fashioned type of\nqueenship. The political situations of Margaret and Isabel were quite similar\ndespite the fact that they lived three centuries apart. Scotland and Portugal\nwere both relatively new small kingdoms undergoing consolidation, and\nneither had crowned or anointed kings. They each had big awkward\nneighbours and more or less integrated minority groups. In this respect Isabel\nfits the model of conversion queen put forward by Jo Ann MacNamara.\nFourteenth-century Portugal, with its memories of Moorish conquest and\ninterests in North Africa and the Atlantic, sometimes compares less well with\ncontemporary France or England than with medieval kingdoms developing\nin frontier zones such as Scotland in the eleventh century, and indeed\nHungary through to the thirteenth.59\nThere is no need for a direct link between the vitae of Isabel and\nMargaret ; it is another example of how models of queenship can\ntranscend time and space. The important point is that the life of St\nMargaret seems to have been written as a guide to queenly behaviour for\nher daughter Matilda (d. 1118), the wife of Henry I of England.60 This\n57 P. Strohm, \u2018Queens as intercessors \u2019, in P. Strohm, Hochon\u2019s arrow: the social imagination of\nfourteenth-century texts, Princeton 1992, 95\u2013119 at pp. 105\u20136; Vita, 178. According to the vita Isabel\nintervened in a quarrel between Dinis and his brother Afonso at an early stage in her queenly\ncareer.\n58 L. L.

In fact the vita may have been aimed at\nthree members of Isabel\u2019s family: her daughter-in-law Beatriz (d. 1359),\nand her grand-daughters Maria (d. 1357), queen of Castile, and Leonor (d.\n1359), queen of Aragon. All three feature prominently in the vita ; the\nauthor reminds the reader that they were left jewelled crowns in Isabel\u2019s\nwill, thus presenting an image of one queen passing on her wealth and\nprestige to others.61 In Beatriz\u2019s case, she was the only person to play a\nrole similar to Isabel\u2019s within Santa Clara, serving the nuns in their new\nrefectory. She was also present when Isabel had a vision of Christ and the\nVirgin Mary just before her death.62\nExamining the careers of these younger women may reveal whether they\nfollowed the model of queenship presented by Isabel. Leonor, queen of\nAlfons IV of Aragon, was widowed early. She quarrelled with her stepson\nPere IV over the rights of her own sons, and became involved in a war\nbetween Aragon and Castile. According to chroniclers, her nephew Pedro I\nof Castile eventually had her killed.63 Leonor\u2019s character, as represented in\nthe chronicles, is not flattering, and in this she compares well with Isabella of\nFrance. Her cousin Maria, on the other hand, was lauded by chroniclers,\nalthough she did not behave very differently. Her husband Alfonso XI of\nCastile preferred his mistress Leonor de Guzman and favoured his children\nby her. Like Isabel, Maria apparently accepted her husband\u2019s affair but\nsupported the interests of her own son, Pedro I. According to chroniclers, she\nalso interceded politically between her husband and her father persuading\nthem to ally against Morocco, an alliance that resulted in a Christian victory\nat Salado in 1340. One of the last great encounters of the Reconquista, this\nbattle may have provided the background to the writing of Isabel\u2019s vita as it\nglorifies such alliances and downplays the more usual competitiveness of the\nIberian kingdoms. Reality of course was much more interesting. It was Maria\nwho ordered the execution of her rival Leonor in 1351, and one of Alfonso\u2019s\nillegitimate sons, Enrique II, deposed Maria\u2019s son Pedro I in 1369, thus\noffering the opposite yet always possible outcome of the kind of conflict in\nwhich Isabel and her son had engaged.64\nMaria\u2019s mother Beatriz may also have tried to behave like her\npredecessor during a major conflict between her son Pedro and his\nfather caused by the murder of Pedro\u2019s concubine, Ine\u02c6s de Castro, at his\nfather\u2019s orders in 1355. Beatriz also supported the Franciscan order and like\n61 Vita, 179, 186, 192; Vasconcelos, Evoluc\u00b8a\u02dco, ii. 13\u201314. 62 Vita, 188, 191.\n63 Pere III of Catalonia (Pedro IV of Aragon), Chronicle, trans.

However, the\ncomparison ends there as she and her husband were buried in Lisbon\nCathedral.65 This may have been a blow to the author\u2019s hopes, since he or\nshe no doubt had hoped to encourage imitation of all aspects of the old\nqueen\u2019s behaviour, including burial in her foundation. Unfortunately,\nPortuguese monarchs still preferred Cistercian houses or chose burial in the\ncathedral of a city that had long since superseded Coimbra in importance.\nHopes may initially have been high for Santa Clara because Ine\u02c6s de Castro,\nmurdered in Coimbra, was at first buried there, but after six years Pedro\nremoved her to Cistercian Alcobac\u00b8a.66 The abbess of Santa Clara who\narranged the initial burial \u2013 none other than Isabel de Cardona, the old\nqueen\u2019s niece \u2013 must have been bitterly disappointed at this. Her possible\nauthorship of the vita could stem from natural interest in the careers of her\nroyal cousins and the fact that she had most to gain from Isabel\u2019s cult in the\nlong-term.67 By writing the vita, Isabel de Cardona may have hoped to secure\nthe future glory of both her family and her nunnery by extolling the virtues of\nthe Rainha Santa. Giving advice in the form of a saint\u2019s life simply reinforced\nthe message. There was no need for Isabel\u2019s female descendants to aspire to\nsainthood; it would be enough if they followed the advice given and became\nmodel queens.\nIsabel of Aragon may have been a model queen for the women of her\nimmediate family. Did she continue to influence subsequent generations, or\nwas she just remembered as an ancestral saint? In 1428 Duarte, son and heir\nof Joa\u02dco I of Portugal, married Leonor, daughter of Fernando I of Aragon.\nThe ceremony took place in Santa Clara de Coimbra near Isabel\u2019s tomb and\nDuarte\u2019s brother, Henry \u2018 the Navigator\u2019, explained that for Leonor \u2018it was\njust as if she had married from the house of Queen Isabel who also came\nfrom Aragon. Every one of us thought that this matter had worked out so well\nbecause of the holiness of the said Queen Isabel from whose house it had\nstarted\u2019.68 Significantly, Leonor was the first Aragonese princess to marry a\nPortuguese crown prince since Isabel did so nearly 150 years before, and for\nmuch the same reason: restoring the balance of power against Castile, so this\nmethod of settling Iberian conflict through marriage created a link between\n65 See Beatriz\u2019s will of 1358 in A.

Dinis imprisoned Isabel in Alenquer during the civil war as her\nuse of this stronghold made her a threat in his eyes. Thus Caterina and Isabel\nwere also linked across the centuries by their queenship rather than by any\naspirations to sainthood.\nIsabel not only influenced her female descendants. Joa\u02dco I, an illegitimate\nson who usurped the throne in 1385, was trying to establish a new dynasty, so\nit is likely that the cult of his Aragonese great-grandmother represented\nlegitimacy, continuity and prestige, much as the alliance with Aragon sealed\nby the marriage of his son represented stability. Isabel probably also had a\nlegitimising function in the eyes of the Habsburg rulers of a united Spain\nand Portugal who eventually secured her canonisation in the seventeenth\ncentury, and of the Braganzas who visited Isabel\u2019s tomb until the Portuguese\nmonarchy was overthrown in the early twentieth century.70 For these\nmonarchs, the figure of the Rainha Santa was tied up in their understanding of\ntheir royal authority. She was more queen than saint to them. Those people\nwho saw Isabel as saint first and foremost were the local people of Coimbra,\nso it is ironic that they still venerate her today, while the idea of a Portuguese\nroyal family is a fading memory.\nIsabel was not a model saint in that she does not compare well to the female\nsaints of the late Middle Ages, including those of the royal house of Hungary.\nThis does not mean that she was not influenced by the example of her aunt,\nElizabeth of Hungary, but hers was a cult that linked Isabel as much to her\nhome in Aragon as to the Franciscan order. The original foundation of Santa\nClara de Coimbra by the Portuguese was in homage to the new queen\u2019s\norigins rather than real appreciation of her saintly lineage; the survival of the\nqueen\u2019s cult in Santa Clara today is a reflection of local religious and political\ninfluences. Isabel is a model queen in two respects : first in that she conforms\nto a model of good queenship, including religious and political behaviours, as\npractised by her mother and numerous other royal women both of her own\ntime and earlier. It seems likely that queenship was taught within families,\neffective even in cases where mother and daughter were separated early on,\nand the interests of a queen\u2019s birth family dictated the nature of her power\nand prestige. Isabel is a model queen in a second respect in that she served as\n69 [de Gois], \u2018Lenda\u2019, 43. 70 Vasconcelos, Evoluc\u00b8a\u02dco, i. 511\u201318.\nI SABEL OF ARAGON : MODEL QUEEN OR MODEL SA INT? 691\na model for future queens of her dynasty, and indeed one of the functions of\nthe vita may have been to guide these women. Isabel was obviously\nremembered as a family saint, but the fact that she had been a queen\nresonates through time. It is not for nothing that she is still called the Rainha\nSanta.\n692 IONA MCCLEERY\n"}
