To investigate the machining \ncharacteristics, bisphenol A polycarbonate has been laser machined in air and under a controllable \nopen liquid film. To provide quantitative analysis, ablation threshold, ablation rate and the attenuation \ncoefficient of the immersing DI water fluid were measured. In ambient air the threshold fluence was \nmeasured to be 37 mJ.cm\n-2\n. Thin film immersion displayed two trends: threshold fluences of 58.6 \nmJcm\n-2\n and 83.9 mJcm\n-2\n. The attenuation of DI water was found to be negligible; thus, the change in \nablation rate resulted from increased confinement of the vapour plume by the liquid medium, \ngenerating higher Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the beam, lowering the laser etch rate. \nSimultaneously, splashing motivated by the confined ablation plume allowed release of plume \npressure before plume etching commenced. This contributed to the loss of total etching efficiency. \nTwo interaction scenarios were obsereved as a result of splashing: (i) intermediate threshold fluence, \nwhere splashing occured after every pulse in a mode that interrupted the flow entirely, leaving an \nambient air interaction for the following pulse; (ii) high threshold fluence, where splashing occured \nfor every pulse in a mode that allowed the flow to recommence over the image before the next pulse \ncausing every pulse to experience Bremsstrahlung attenuation. Since attenuation of the immersion \nliquid was negligible, it is the action of the constrained ablation plume within a thin flowing \nimmersion liquid, the resultant Bremsstrahlung attenuation and splashing events that are the critical \nmechanisms that modify the primary ablation characteristics. \nIntroduction \nThe use of liquid immersion ablation was attempted primarily with the intention of debris control \nduring excimer laser micromachining of Bisphenol A polycarbonate, alternatively known as lexan [1]; \nhowever, Dowding [2] found that the use of thin film laminar flow water immersion during excimer \nablation  of bisphenol A polycarbonate resulted in a reduction in surface roughness of machined \nfeatures. This effect has potential benefits for micro lens array manufacture where profile accuracy is \nkey [3]. The reduction in surface roughness is an interesting phenomenon with many possible causes. \nThe smoothing effect of liquid immersion observed by Dowding [2] suggests the ablation mechanism \nis altered significantly by the action of laminar flow liquid immersion. This may result in an alteration \nto two primary parameters used for measuring pulsed laser machining efficiency: (i) the ablation \nthreshold; (ii) the ablation rate. \nUp to this time all research into liquid immersion assisted laser machining has involved stagnant \nliquid. This work explores for the first time the impact of laminar flow liquid immersion on ablation \nrate and ablation threshold, using the data gleaned to identify any differences in the machining \nmechanism between ablation in ambient air and under laminar flow liquid immersion. \nAll mediums through which electromagnetic radiation passes present resistance to progress dependent \nupon medium characteristics and wavelength [7]. The use of a liquid to cover a material to be ablated \nposes an added complexity to the beam path. The light must pass from the demagnifying optic, into \nambient air, then into de ionized (DI) water before colliding with a sample surface, whereafter the \nbeam should reach focus. At every medium interface the beam will encounter changes in refractive \nindex, modifying the focal length of the demagnified beam. Each new medium poses losses to beam \nenergy through reflectance and attenuation [6,7]. This loss of beam energy will result in lower beam \nfluence at the image. Lower fluence should correspond with a lower ablation rate [8]; therefore it is \nexpected that the depth of a feature machined under liquid immersion will be lower than that of a \ncorresponding feature machined in ambient air. \nThe ablation rate and threshold are dependent upon the ablation mechanism that removed the material \nto produce the feature. This ablation mechanism is a complex and contentious subject, with recent \nliterature alluding to a number of mechanisms that work together simultaneously [11-Error! \nReference source not found.]. The most common practice for laser micromachining is for ablation to \ntake place in an ambient air environment, allowing simple material loading and rapid processing times \nwithout the need for time consuming gas evacuation procedures. The ablation mechanism is also \nmaterial specific, with much debate surrounding the exact nature of polymer interactions with short \nwavelength laser beams. In the case of a 248 nm beam interacting with a polymer material in ambient \nair, the theory of explosive evaporation, postulated by Kelly and Miotello [17], which accounts for a \nprimarily photochemical interaction with a photothermal element active between beam photons and \nthe material\u2019s atomic matrix. Yang [19] develops on this to explain that formation of ablation \nproducts during pulsed laser ablation, PLA, in gasses is a result of condensation of the plasma plume \ngenerated by the ejection of ablated gaseous products from the solid target. In this scenario, there are \nthree critical stages, generation, transformation and condensation. The key stage with respect to a \nmachined feature is the generation phase. In the case of laser ablation in a gas at atmospheric pressure, \nthe vapour plume can expand relatively unimpeded as there is little difference in density and viscosity \nbetween the vapour plume and surrounding atmosphere as described in Figure 2. When ablating \nmaterial beneath a film of liquid the interaction between beam, plume and material changes: the \nexpansion of the plume is now restricted by the increased viscosity of the surrounding liquid [20]; \nmolecules attempting to escape the plume are prevented by the plume\/liquid interface as described in \nFigure 2. The confinement of the ablation plume has been found by Zhu et al. [Error! Reference \nsource not found.] to etch the surface of the workpiece. Zhu et al. claim the optimum film thickness \nfor ablation rate to be approximately 1.1mm. Recently Elaboudi et al. [Error! Reference source not \nfound.-Error! Reference source not found.] have conducted experiments using 248 nm excimer \npulsed radiation to ablate polymer targets including polycarbonate. These results provide support for \nthe findings of previous authors: the ablation threshold decreases when using liquid immersion \n(Elaboudi et al. use ultrapure water) compared to traditional ablation in ambient air; photomechanical \ninteractions driven by thermal evaporation are primarily responsible for the ejection of debris \nmaterial; typically debris generated had a diameter of 50 nm and a chemistry close to that of the \noriginal material, supporting a \u201ccold\u201d or photomechanical removal mechanism. Another theory \npostulated by these authors [Error! Reference source not found.] is that some debris is generated by \na hydrolysis reaction for immersed PET ablation in addition to photochemical degradation as an \nexplanation for the decreased ablation threshold of the PET when immersed in ultra pure water. The \nuse of excimer laser radiation also has been shown to have an impact on the morphology and \nmicrostructure of polycarbonate. Parvin et al. [26] use 248 nm excimer radiation amongst other \nwavelengths to irradiate polycarbonate samples. Use of high fluences (6 J.cm\n-2\n) resulted in extensive \ncrosslinking of the polycarbonate microstructure, thus generating significant surface hardening of the \nmaterial. Zangeneh et al. [27] credit this increase in surface hardness to a change in the size and \npopulation of the micro cone shaped microstructure of the material, which increase drastically at high \nlaser fluences. \nMAIN TEXT \nExperimental Procedures \nMaterials \nBisphenol A polycarbonate (Holbourne Plastics, Ltd), was as received in 1200 mm x 1000 mm sheets \nof 0.5 mm thickness. Prior to excimer laser processing, the bisphenol A polycarbonate sheet was cut \ninto rectangular sections of 30 mm x 10 mm using scissors, as this is a shear cutting technique which \navoids production of debris. Protective cover sheets were then peeled off each sample. \nLaser Processing Procedure \nAn excimer laser (EMG 203 MSC; Lambda Physique, GmbH) using KrF as the excitation medium \nwas used to produce a pulsed beam with a wavelength of 248 nm and pulse duration of 25 ns. \nThereafter the beam was supplied to a laser micromachining optics assembly (EX-PS-500; Exitech \nLtd), where the raw beam was homogenised in the x- and y-axis before being passed through a \nstainless steel mask to produce either a square or circular objective beam. The masked beam was then \ndemagnified by 15x to produce an ablation spot with a depth of focus (DoF) of 6 \u03bcm. A profile of the \nmasked beam has been obtained using a beam profiler (SP620U; Spiricon, Ltd). As one can see from \nFigure 3, it demonstrates a lack of squareness to the beam profile. In this instance this causes greater \npower density on the left of the mask. \nImmersing any sample to be machined under a thin film laminar flow of DI water presents significant \ntechnical challenges. The possibility of beam generated splashing means an enclosure to the test rig is \nrequired to protect the tool optics from water damage whilst maintaining a stable environment within \nwhich to machine. In this work a fused silica window was used to allow the beam to pass into the \nenclosure with minimum loss as shown schematically in Figure 4. However, the masked and \ndemagnified beam was not columnated on the tool used; thus when it passed through the fused silica \nwindow of the enclosure the focal length of the beam was modified. The tool used for these \nexperiments used an auto focussing system. This meant the correct focal length of the tool without the \nenclosure, to which the sample is set before the experiment was conducted, would be outside the focal \nrange of the tool when the enclosure window was installed. This is the reason for the poor focus \nexperienced by Dowding [2]. To check the effect of focus modification using liquid immersion, \naccurate dry focus must be maintained; hence the window had to be removed. Even without the \nenclosure window the use of an immersion liquid presented complexities for the beam path. \nAs shown in figure 4 the sample was mounted on a stainless steel table by means of the capillary \naction of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) which was applied to the sample table before the sample was \nmounted. The table was located to a pivot cradle by a tongue and groove arrangement twined with a \ndowel for linear constraint - magnets allowed simple and secure repeatable fixing between the table \nand cradle. The cradle allowed the table to be tilted around its mid-point by use of an adjustable \nthumb screw that supported the water inlet end of the table. This tilt mechanism had two experimental \napplications. First it allowed the angle of incidence between the excimer laser beam and the sample to \nbe modified. Second, it allowed the run-off rate of the liquid to be changed independently of the \nsupplied liquid flow rate; hence the film thickness on the sample could be controlled. Liquid was \nsupplied by use of gravity feed from a butt supported at a constant height. The supply was gated by a \nvalve to allow rudimentary control of flow rate before being delivered though a flat nozzle mounted \n0.5 mm above the sample. The sample table and water nozzle were positioned over a miniature basin \nwith a hose leading to a sealed storage tub positioned a distance below the basin, again using gravity \nfeed to ensure evacuation of liquid from the basin. \nThe basin geometry also provided location for a clear perspex enclosure within which a controlled \nenvironment for experiments could be maintained. That enclosure provided repeatable location for the \nwater nozzle with respect to the basin and therefore sample table. The enclosure was not entirely \nsealed for the purpose of maintaining more accurate focus for these experiments, as described above. \nThis did present a danger to the tool optics from beam-generated splashing of the immersion liquid; \nbut with the use of a small orifice this possibility was minimized. \nDuring normal open use the rig was mounted on a driven lift stage that was adapted to dynamically \nadjust the sample height dependent upon a signal generated by logical interpretation of the deflection \nof a reflected reference beam. With the inclusion of the perspex enclosure for these experiments; \nhowever, the reference beam was obstructed and this dynamic focussing method could not be used. \nInstead the sample height is set before the experiment to being as close to the centre of DoF as \npossible, then the stage is set to maintain its location whilst the sample and enclosure are mounted to \nit, as the dry samples displayed in figure 5 show, this is a viable method for finding focus with this \nequipment. The depth of focus, DoF, also played an important role in limiting the tilt angle (for a 500 \n\u00b5m diameter spot size the maximum tilt angle possible whilst keeping the entire image inside focal \ntolerance is 1.36\u00b0, assuming the centre of the image lies at the pivot axis) \nEach sample was used for only one test to prevent cross-contamination. After lasing ended the \nenclosure was removed and the sample placed into a cell of a sealed sample tray to protect it from \natmospheric dust. \nSamples were produced separately for ambient air and liquid immersion. To measure ablation \nthreshold separate samples were produced whilst requesting the  laser pulse energies listed in column \nA of Table 1. These requested pulse energies delivered the spot energies listed for ambient air and \nliquid immersion in columns b and c respectively of Table 1. All beam energy values quoted in this \nwork were measured using a power meter head (LMP 10i, Coherent, Inc) connected to a reader unit \n(Labmaster; Coherent, Inc). Spot energies were measured twice for each sample - once before the \nsample was machined and once after the sample was machined. In this way any change in the beam \nbetween measurements was accounted for. The image spot diameter for the dry samples was 650 \u03bcm; \nthe spot diameter used for the liquid immersion was 530 \u03bcm. To measure the ablation threshold in \nambient air 500 pulses were used at 10 Hz, measured by opening the laser shutter for 50 s. Assuming \na human accuracy of \u00b10.15 s, a pulse number error of \u00b11.5 can be quoted for these results. To measure \nthe ablation threshold for liquid immersion 150 pulses were used at a rate of 30 Hz, measured by \nopening the shutter for 5 s. Assuming the same human accuracy as that estimated for the ambient air \nsamples gives a pulse number error of \u00b14.5. The lower number of pulses used for the immersion \nsamples was a requirement because the DI water supply was limited to a small butt and the extraction \nsystem became overwhelmed quickly by water volume as it did not include and extraction pump. \nTo produce ablation rate samples a laser pulse energy of 200 mJ was requested for all samples. Again \nthe spot energy for every sample was measured both before and after the sample was machined, with \nthe average of these two values stated for the corresponding sample in columns B and D of Table 2. \nSamples were produced using differing numbers of pulses. These numbers are displayed in columns A \nand C of Table 2. \nSample Analysis Techniques \nBecause depth measurement using an optical microscope requires human judgement, the ablation \ndepths were measured using a dragged needle profiler (CM300 Talysurf; Taylor-Hobson, Ltd). As \nsuch, any possibility of profile error was minimized. \nResults and Discussion \nEffects of thin film laminar flow water immersion ablation on Ablation Threshold \nThe ablation threshold can offer insight into the nature of the ablation mechanism at work in a beam \u2013 \nmaterial interaction. In the case considered herein the beam and material remain the same, but the \nmechanics of that interaction in terms of chemical reactions, Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the plume \nand the contribution of plume etching to the removal of material yield a significant modification to the \nablation threshold. Two data sets (ablation in ambient air and ablation under thin film laminar flow DI \nwater immersion) are plotted in graph Figure 6. The plot of data for the sample machined in ambient \nair shows a strong linear correlation, with all the results being tightly packed around the trend line. \nThis would suggest that the threshold value yielded for ablation in ambient air is accurate. The data \nplotted for immersion machined samples includes four anomalies, plotted as triangles in Figure 6. \nThis is interesting as these four anomalies appear to lie in a trend, which yields an intermediate \nthreshold fluence value between ablation in ambient air and under typical liquid immersion. The \nintermediate group could be caused by either one of three occurrences or a combination thereof: (i) \nThe liquid flow changes in geometry with respect to time due to natural turbulence generated surface \nripple; thus a thinner or non-existent liquid coating to the material surface may have been present for a \nperiod during the machining of anomalous results. (ii) Ablation plume generated splashing could also \ncause significant geometric change to the liquid flow with a similar result: the plume, which becomes \ncompressed by the high viscosity of the immersion liquid to a pressure that is uncontainable by a thin \nfilm of covering fluid, results in liquid rupture and splashing. The result of such splashing is an \nuncovered section of the sample in the flow, thus allowing a following pulse unobstructed access for \nablation in an ambient air interaction, surrounded by flowing liquid. This is inline with the findings of \nZhu et al. [Error! Reference source not found.] (iii) The focus of the anomalous results could have \nbeen unusually good when compared to the general trend of these samples as all the anomalous results \nwere greater than the trend. This is a situation that is a consequence of changing immersion fluid \nsurface geometry, where non-repeatable flow geometry could act to focus or defocus the beam with \nrespect to time, resulting in varying fluence levels, and varying etch depths. This effect would result \nin a widened spectrum of depth data, rather than the clear data groupings demonstrated in this data. \nThe threshold fluence for bisphenol A polycarbonate is only 37.7 mJcm\n-2\n in ambient air, indicating \nthe excellent machining attributes that bisphenol A polycarbonate poses for excimer laser machining. \nSuch a finding is in accord with those of Lemoine et al. [10]. In contrast, the non-anomalous plot for \nthin film laminar flow water immersion machined samples require 66.7 mJcm\n-2\n, a significant increase \nin threshold fluence over the sample machined in ambient air. This goes against the findings of \nFabbro et. al [20] and Elaboudi et al. [Error! Reference source not found.-Error! Reference \nsource not found.], who found that the use of liquid immersion using thicker, stagnant films of \nultrapure water greatly reduced the ablation threshold. According to Zhu et al. an optimum flow \nthickness for liquid immersion ablation exists [Error! Reference source not found.], occurring at \naround 1.1mm. Since film thickness is critical, then it is reasonable to postulate that the beam passes \nthrough the medium to the sample as normal and ablation commences, generating an ablation plume; \nthe liquid restricts the expansion of the plume, compressing it, increasing its optical density with \nrespect to a similar plume unimpeded in ambient air, thus resulting in greater Bremsstrahlung \nattenuation and lower laser etch rates. Simultaneously, the increased pressure of the plume, in union \nwith the thin (less than 1.1mm thickness) laminar film causes rupture of the flow, resulting in \nsplashing of the immersion liquid and a loss of plume pressure before the plume etch threshold of the \nmaterial is achieved. Hence the laser etch rate is decreased without the addition of plume etching that \nnormally occurs when using thick (over 1.1mm) films. This indicates that the four erroneous data \npoints plotted in Figure 6 were machined in a situation where the etching contribution given by the \nlaser beam was higher: The splashing occurred in a mode that allowed more pulses to arrive at the \nsample surface without having to pass through a liquid medium, thus not experiencing the \nBremsstrahlung attenuation of the compressed plume generated by the previous pulse, giving a lower \neffective threshold fluence at the image. \nThe gradients shown in Figure 6 for ambient air and thin film laminar flow water immersion \nmachining suggest that the ablation rate response of liquid immersion with increasing fluence is \ngreater than the response of ablation in ambient air. Further inspection of the plot gradients yields \nsupport for the explanation of the anomalous results detailed above. The anomalous data points \ndisplay the steepest gradient and all fall close to the trend line. This observation supports the idea that \nchanges in liquid flow geometry gives increased ablation rate rather than the effects of randomly \nimproved focus. The precise cause of this change in geometry can also be attributed using the gradient \nas evidence; for if the erroneous results were purely due to nozzle generated flow variations the \ngradient would have been similar to that of the non-anomalous results, but less tightly packed around \nthe trend line as this would be a random error response. More likely is a change in liquid geometry \ndue to plume generated splashing: as fluence rises, volumes of water removed from the flow by \nsplashing are proportionate. Consequently higher fluence pulses result in greater exposure of the \nsurface to ambient air  and more exposure to an ambient air level of laser etching [2]. \nEffects of thin film laminar flow water immersion ablation on Ablation Rate \nThe ablation rates for bisphenol A polycarbonate machined in ambient air and under thin film laminar \nflow water immersion are shown in Figure 7. The ablation rate is gives useful information concerning \nvolumetric removal of material once above the fluence threshold of the material and will give further \ninsight into efficiency of etching under a thin laminar flow water film. It must be noted that the plot \nmade in ambient air is less prone to error due to the higher number of pulses used. Despite the small \nnumber of pulses used to collate data for immersion ablation, the plot generated shows that every \npoint is close to the trend line; thus an accurate measurement of the true ablation rate has been \nobtained. \nFigure 7 demonstrates laser machining in ambient air offers higher ablation rates than thin film \nlaminar flow water immersion machining as would be expected given the threshold fluence values \ndetermined from Figure 6, but the decrease in ablation rate due to the use of immersion ablation is not \nsignificant. The difference between the gradients of the trend lines for ablation in ambient air and \nunder thin film laminar flow water immersion is 0.09, showing a drop in ablation rate of 20%. It was \nexpected that ablation rate in liquid would be lower than that of ambient air; if the threshold fluence \nfor removal of material in ambient air is half that required under liquid immersion, it can be expected \nthat removal of material will continue at a similarly high rate once the fluence threshold is exceeded. \nInstead the difference in ablation rate is minimal (50% was expected, 20% measured), once again \nsupporting the proposed scenario stated above, where ablation plume motivated splashing of the \nimmersion fluid film releases the plume vapour and allows less Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the \nfollowing pulse. \nDe Ionized Water Attenuation of excimer laser radiation. \nThe results of the ablation threshold and rate experiments detailed above are interesting; they raise \ntwo potential reasons for the response to medium change: (i) increased Bremsstrahlung attenuation \ngenerated by restricted plume expansion as described by Zhu et al. [Error! Reference source not \nfound.], without the plume etching mechanism that normally accompanies plume compression due to \nvapour plume motivated splashing of the immersion film before plume the plume etch pressure \nthreshold of the sample is achieved; (ii) the attenuation of the DI water medium is significantly \ndifferent to that of air and is attenuating the beam on route to the sample and lowering the image \nfluence. For conclusive support for one of these possibilities the attenuation of the immersion medium \nwas measured. A special pot has been manufactured, using a fused silica slide that has been epoxy \nresin bonded to a transparent acrylic tube which is internally marked with a millimetre scale. This pot \nwas placed on top of the power meter head, both of which are a significant distance below the focal \npoint of the optics. The mask used for this experiment would give a 500 \u03bcm diameter circular spot at \nfocus. The water level and corresponding readings taken are plotted in Figure 8. The effect of \nincreasing water depth for the beam to pass through is small. Most fluctuations in the values can be \nexplained by the random variations in pulse energy, pulse to pulse, inherent of excimer lasers. Thus it \nfollows that the loss of etch rate by use of liquid immersion must be a mechanism other than \nimmersion medium attenuation of the laser beam. Hence this result gives further support for the \nproposal that splashing and the mode of splashing with regard to the loss of plume etching and \nincrease in Bremsstrahlung attenuation is the reason for a loss in lasing efficiency. Indeed, the \nfindings of Fabbro et al. [20] and Elaboudi et al. [Error! Reference source not found.-Error! \nReference source not found.] showed for open thick film immersion lasing efficiency is increased, \nbut Xhu et al. [Error! Reference source not found.] showed that the effectiveness of an open film is \nlimited to a critical film thickness of 1.1mm. The findings in this work were obtained using a film \nthickness much lower than 1.1mm. It must be noted that the fluence of the beam at the surface of the \nliquid is insufficient to cause splashing, thus the effect of splashing to the loss of beam energy cannot \nbe measured with this technique. It would be of interest to define a magnitude for the effect of \nsplashing by placing a pool of water in the DoF of the laser optics and taking a set of beam energy \nreadings for differing energies and liquid depths. Nevertheless the findings herein are insightful \ninsofar as they show that a loss in lasing fluence, and therefore efficiency, is not the result of the DI \nwater liquid medium when using open thin film laminar flow immersion assisted machining, but is \ncaused by the interaction between vapour plume, beam and surrounding thin liquid medium. \nConclusions \nMeasurements of ablation threshold and ablation rate when KrF excimer laser machining bisphenol A \npolycarbonate samples in ambient air and immersed in a thin film laminar flow of DI water showed \ndifferences in the machining mechanisms. In ambient air the threshold fluence was measured to be 37 \nmJcm\n-2\n with an ablation rate of 0.459 \u03bcm\/pulse, under thin film immersion two trends were identified, \ngiving threshold fluences of 58.6 mJcm\n-2\n and 83.9 mJcm\n-2\n respectively, the ablation rate for immersed \nsamples was measured to be 0.367 \u03bcm\/pulse. The attenuation coefficient of the immersing DI water \nwas measured separately and found to be negligible. \nThe observed change in ablation rate and ablation threshold cannot be directly explained by the \nattenuation coefficient of the water medium. It is believed that the change in ablation rate was \ngenerated by the increased confinement of the vapour plume by the liquid medium during immersion \nablation. This in turn generated higher Bremsstrahlung attenuation of the beam and subsequently \nproduced the observed 20% reduction in the laser etching rate from 0.459 \u03bcm\/pulse to 0.367 \n\u03bcm\/pulse. This is reasonable because in contrast to thick film liquid immersion where the confinement \nand resultant increased pressure of the plume etches the sample to a greater extent than the laser, the \nablation plume can only be constricted to a limited extent by thin film laminar flow immersion before \nthe ablation plume causes rupture and splashing of the immersion liquid. This means that the beam \nstill experiences some extra Bremsstrahlung attenuation before liquid rupture occurs, but the action of \nplume etching is nonexistent for thin films. \nThe observed splashing of the thin film laminar flow DI water during excimer laser machining was \nrecorded in the data spread. This suggests that two independent interaction types are active: (i) an \nintermediate threshold fluence level where splashing occurs after every pulse in a mode that interrupts \nthe flow entirely. This leaves an ambient air interaction for the following pulse; (ii) a high threshold \nfluence level where splashing occurs for every pulse in a mode which allows the flow to recommence \nover the image before the next pulse. This results in every pulse experiencing high Bremsstrahlung \nattenuation. These two scenarios show a relationship between pulse fluence and fluid rupture timing, \nwhere medium fluence causes maximum flow disruption by splashing and high fluence results in \ninstantaneous but short term interruption of the flow. \nFurther verification was obtained from measurement of the attenuation of the immersing liquid, which \nwas found to be negligible. This establishes that the immersing liquid is not in itself responsible for \nthe loss of fluence at the image and therefore lasing efficiency, but instead is the consequence of the \naction of the ablation plume when constrained within a thin flowing immersing liquid and the \nresultant Bremsstrahlung attenuation and splashing events that occur. Clearly it is the interaction of \nthe confined plume with the beam, combined with the inability of the plume to etch the surface of the \nsample that is of importance. \nReferences \n1 Dowding, C.
