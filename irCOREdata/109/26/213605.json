In \nthis paper, we adopt a multilevel simultaneous equation modelling approach to assess the \nimpact of school resources on pupil attainment at age 14. This paper is the first to apply a \nsimultaneous equation model to estimate the impact of school resources on pupil \nachievement, using the newly available National Pupil Database\/Pupil Level Annual School \nCensus (NPDB\/PLASC).  \n \nKeywords: education production function, multilevel simultaneous equation model, school \nresources \n \n*Address for correspondence: Fiona Steele, Centre for Multilevel Modelling, Graduate \nSchool of Education, University of Bristol, 2 Priory Road, Bristol BS8 1TX, Email: \nFiona.Steele@bristol.ac.uk \n2 \n1. Introduction \n \nFor policy-makers and parents alike, improving educational achievement in UK schools is a \npolicy priority. There is certainly an economic imperative to raise educational achievement, \ngiven that an additional year of education in the OECD area is estimated to increase \neconomic output by between 3 and 6% (OECD, 2004). Currently, the UK spends around 5% \nof its annual Gross Domestic Product on education, including primary, secondary and \npostsecondary (compared to an OECD mean of 5.6%), and expenditure has been increasing \nsince the mid 1990s. Nonetheless, spending in UK secondary schools (US$5933) is below the \nOECD mean of US$6510 (OECD, 2004). However, lower expenditure does not necessarily \nmean lower achievement, at least in aggregate. The UK, along with countries such as \nAustralia, Finland, Ireland and Korea, spends a lower than average amount on secondary \nschooling but its pupils perform relatively well in international tests of pupil achievement, \nsuch as the Programme for International Pupil Assessment (Machin and Vignoles, 2005). An \nobvious policy question is therefore whether an increase in per pupil expenditure on \neducation, or a reduction in the average pupil-teacher ratio in schools, is a viable means of \nimproving pupil attainment across the board. There are a number of reasons why this may not \nin fact be a feasible policy option. One possibility that is much discussed in the literature, and \nwhich has hugely important policy implications, is that state schools are inefficient in their \nuse of resources, so that higher spending schools do not systematically have better pupil \noutcomes (Hanushek, 1997). This paper not only aims to provide empirical evidence to guide \npolicy-makers on this issue, but also seeks to overcome some important methodological \ndifficulties that plague many of the previous studies in this area of research. \n \nAnother policy issue of particular concern in the UK is the low achievement of specific \ngroups of pupils, such as those from lower socio-economic backgrounds and certain gender\/ \nethnic groups. Again, an obvious question is whether we should be improving the outcomes \nof these pupils by spending more on their education. This research question is explored in our \nprevious work on this issue (Leva\u010di\u0107 et al., 2005), which used an instrumental variable \napproach, and some preliminary simultaneous equation modelling, to examine the \nrelationship between school resourcing levels and the attainment of different subgroups of \nEnglish pupils. Here, we extend the multilevel simultaneous equation model used in this \nearlier work to try to accurately ascertain the direction and magnitude of any links between \nschool resources \u2013 as measured by per student expenditure and the school pupil-teacher ratio \n3 \n\u2013 and the mean educational attainment of pupils in England.   \n \nThere is a large and controversial literature analysing the relationship between school \nresourcing levels and pupil achievement, dating back to the pioneering work by Coleman et \nal. (1966). Early work on this issue using US data suggested a weak and somewhat \ninconsistent relationship between school resources and pupil achievement (Burtless, 1996; \nHanushek, 1979, 1986, 1997; see also Volume 78 of the Review of Economics and Statistics \nfor a range of articles on this issue). International research confirms this view (W\u00f6\u00dfmann \n2003).  However, this view was disputed by some, including Laine et al. (1996), Card and \nKrueger (1992) and Krueger (2003). A recent and comprehensive summary of a range of \nevidence on the impact of class size is Averett and McLennan (2004). They found the \nevidence base to be mixed, in terms of methodologies and results, and were unable to reach a \ndefinite conclusion about the impact of smaller classes on pupil achievement.  \n \nOne possible explanation for finding a weak relationship between classroom and school \nresourcing levels and pupil achievement is that schools are inefficient, lacking the \ncompetitive pressures required to make them use resources more effectively. Thus the issue \nof resourcing also relates to a large and growing body of work that has investigated, either \ntheoretically or empirically, the impact of increased competition and quasi-market forces in \neducation (for example, Glennerster, 1991; Cohn, 1997; and Bradley et al., 2000). Another \npossible explanation for the insignificant relationship between resourcing levels and pupil \nachievement is that the way in which education is delivered, i.e. the technology of education \nproduction, may need to vary across pupil types. Lazear (2001), for example, found evidence \nthat optimal class sizes were much larger for better-behaved pupils. This too might explain \nwhy it is difficult to find significant class size effects. \n \nLargely however, the controversy in this literature centres on the extent to which studies that \nshow no significant relationship between school resources and pupil achievement are able to \novercome a number of methodological difficulties. One major methodological difficulty in \nthe literature is the problem of the endogeneity of school resources due to the non-random \nway in which funds are allocated across schools.  In the UK, schools with higher \nconcentrations of lower attaining pupils receive more funding per pupil.  If this feature of \nresource allocation is ignored, a true positive effect of increasing resources will be \nunderstated.  In addition, there may be unobservable or poorly measured characteristics of \n4 \nschools, and also of local education authorities (LEAs), which influence both resource \nallocation and pupil attainment.  For example, one factor in the funding allocation formula \nused by LEAs is the proportion of socially disadvantaged pupils in a school, which is also \nassociated with pupil outcomes.  If a model for pupil attainment does not include adequate \nmeasures of pupils\u2019 social background, a true positive resource effect will be diluted or may \neven appear negative.  \n \nThere are a number of potential methods that might be used to overcome this endogeneity \nproblem, including random assignment. For example, the Tennessee STAR class size \nexperiment randomly allocated children in primary school to small and large class sizes. \nResults from STAR suggest that smaller classes do increase pupil attainment and that gains \npersist to the school leaving age and college (Krueger and Whitmore, 2001). Another method \nthat is used to overcome the endogeneity problem is a natural experiment. The international \nliterature using natural experiments, such as rules on class size, or court-imposed policies to \nraise spending on schools, has produced mixed results. Angrist and Lavy (1999) and  Jepson \nand Rivkin (2002) found positive effects of smaller class size on pupil attainment for Israel \nand California respectively.  However, Hoxby (2000) found no effect of class size in \nConnecticut, while Dobbelsteen et al. (2002), instrumenting on teacher allocation rules, \nreported a significant positive effect of larger class size on attainment for the Netherlands.  \n \nYet another approach to tackling endogeneity is to include a large number of control \nvariables to reduce the possibility of covariance between resources and any unobserved \nvariables that affect attainment. For example, Wilson (2000) using extensive data on family \nand neighbourhoods for the US found school spending to be positively related to high school \ngraduation and years of schooling. Another method tried by Hakkinen et al. (2003) is to use \npanel data over a number of years to difference out school and district effects. They find no \neffects on exam scores in Finnish upper secondary schools of changes in per pupil spending \nfrom 1990-98. \n \nIt is fair to say, however, that the vast majority of school resource effect studies have not \nbeen able to address the endogeneity problem. This is certainly the case in the UK (Leva\u010di\u0107 \nand Vignoles, 2002). UK studies that have made some attempt to address endogeneity have \ngenerally found small but statistically significant positive effects from school resource \n5 \nvariables on educational outcomes (Dearden et al., 2001; Dolton and Vignoles, 2000; \nDustmann et al., 2003; Iacovou, 2002).  \n \nEndogeneity issues are not the only methodological difficulty in this literature. For example, \nmuch of the work on resourcing has had to rely on quite aggregated data, rather than data at \nthe level of the individual pupil. Aggregation bias is therefore a problem for some of the \nstudies in this field (Hanushek et al., 1996). Only recently in the UK has large-scale \nnationally representative pupil level data become available with which one can address the \nresourcing issue.  \n \nAnother important methodological issue to be considered is the intra-school correlations in \npupil responses.  The need to control for clustering in the analysis of hierarchically structured \ndata is well known (see, e.g., Goldstein, 2003).  One consequence of ignoring clustering is \nthe underestimation of standard errors due to the decrease in the effective sample size, and in \ngeneral the underestimation is most severe for explanatory variables defined at the cluster \nlevel.  In the present case, it is especially important to adjust for clustering because the \nvariables of major interest, measures of school resources, are school-level characteristics.   \n \nIn this paper, we adopt a multilevel simultaneous equation modelling approach to assess the \nimpact of school resources on pupil attainment at age 14. A multilevel model is used to allow \nfor clustering of pupil outcomes by school and LEA, and clustering of school resources by \nLEA.  A simultaneous equation model is used to adjust for the endogeneity of school \nresource allocation.  In this approach, pupil attainment and a measure of school resources are \ntreated as a bivariate response.  A multilevel model is defined for each response with LEA \nand school level random effects included in each; these random effects may be correlated \nacross the attainment and resource equations, which allows explicitly for correlation between \nthe unobserved LEA and school characteristics that influence each response.  Our approach \ndiffers from the instrumental variable (IV) method traditionally used to account for \nendogeneity in the assumptions made about the level at which selection effects operate.  The \nstandard approach involves estimating equations for the outcome of interest and the \nendogenous regressor, either simultaneously or more commonly in two stages, but the \nequations are linked via correlated residuals defined at the lowest level of observation, in this \ncase the pupil.  This method may be inappropriate on two counts:  first, it incorrectly treats \nschool resources as a pupil-level variable and, second, it does not recognise that endogeneity \n6 \narises due to correlation between unobservables at the school or LEA level rather than at the \npupil level.   \n \nThus our approach takes account of observable and unobservable selection processes at the \nlevel of the school and LEA that determine resourcing levels. We also recognise that there are \npotentially pupil-level selection processes: good students may choose better schools and these \nschools will on average be less well funded.  We do allow for pupil selection of schools on \nthe basis of observable characteristics. In particular we control for prior achievement (akin to \nthe value-added model) and socio-economic status of the pupil, as well as some other pupil \ncharacteristics that may determine school choice. This study therefore goes a long way to \nredress the methodological difficulties of earlier work, which we anticipate will lead to \nresource effects becoming more apparent. Nevertheless, we do not control for selection of \nschools by pupils on the basis of unobservables. Thus, given the negative correlation between \nschool performance and school resourcing, our estimates may still be conservative and \nunderstate the effects of resourcing. \n \nThis paper is the first to apply a simultaneous equation model to estimate the impact of \nschool resources on pupil achievement, using the newly available National Pupil Database \nand Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (NPDB\/PLASC) data sets.  The NPDB\/PLASC data \nsets contain information on the characteristics and achievement of every pupil in an English \nschool, as well as characteristics of the schools themselves.  The NPDB\/PLASC data are \nsupplemented by information on schools\u2019 levels of resourcing, derived from data submitted to \nthe Department for Education and Skills by local education authorities. NPDB\/PLASC \nprovides information on individual pupils\u2019 attainment at age 14 (Key Stage 3) in 2003 and \ntheir attainment at age 11 (Key Stage 2) in 2000, enabling us to control for prior attainment in \nour model. Previous work in this area has been restricted to using either more aggregated data \n(at the school or LEA level) or relying on the National Child Development Study data set \nthat, whilst rich, is somewhat dated in terms of providing empirical evidence to inform \neducation policy today (its sample consists of a cohort born in 1958).  \n \n2. Background on the Secondary Education System in England \n \nIn England, educational spending on both primary and secondary schooling is administered \nby 150 local education authorities (LEAs), which are under local government control. \n7 \nHowever, in the years for which our study data were collected, the majority of the money for \neducation came from central government via a block grant (the Revenue Support Grant) to \nthese LEAs for all local services. LEAs could spend this grant more or less according to their \nown priorities, and decide to spend more or less than the amount notionally allocated per \npupil in the block grant. The amount of money received by a particular LEA from central \ngovernment nominally for education, which until recently was known as the Education \nStandard Spending Assessment (SSA), depends on a number of factors that influence the \nexpected educational costs in an LEA. For example, the education SSA takes account of pupil \nnumbers, socio-economic factors (e.g. the number of immigrants in the area, the proportion \nof the local population in lower socio-economic groups and the numbers of families on state \nbenefit), population density and cost of living in the area.  \n \nThe fact that socio-economic factors partly determine the SSA implies that in the UK greater \nschool resources are allocated to areas of greater educational need. This is reinforced by the \nfact that the actual block grant given to LEAs takes account of the potential in the LEA to \nraise local tax for educational spending. Thus prosperous areas tend to receive less from \ncentral government since they can potentially raise more revenue from local taxation. The \nactual expenditure per pupil also varies systematically by LEA according to factors such as \nthe political party in control of the local authority and their educational priorities. The fact \nthat LEAs have some discretion over how to spend the grant they receive\n \nagain reinforces the \npoint that endogeneity is likely to be a problem in any analysis of the influence of educational \nexpenditure on pupil achievement. \n \nUnfortunately our data restrict us to looking at the effect of school resourcing on pupils and \nschools in the state education system. More than half a million pupils in England are, \nhowever, educated in private schools. Such schools are more highly resourced, with funding \nlevels being, on average, nearly 50% higher in the private sector. Pupils in private schools are \nneedless to say more advantaged, coming from higher socio-economic backgrounds. To the \nextent that they are also more able and may also come from families that place a particularly \nhigh value on education, they are not representative of the entire population of pupils. Our \nestimates do not therefore address the issue of the impact of school resourcing for all pupils \nbut only those educated in the state education system.  \n \n3. Methods \n8 \n \n3.1 The standard multilevel modelling approach \n \nWe denote by ijky  the attainment at age 14 in maths, English or science of pupil i  ( i =1, . . ., \njkn ; \uf0e5\uf03d\nkj\njknn\n,\n)  in school j  ( j =1, . . ., kJ ; \uf0e5\uf03d\nk\nkJJ ) in LEA k  ( k =1, . . ., K ).  The \nstandard approach to modelling attainment, allowing for clustering at the school and LEA \nlevels, would be to fit a three-level random effects model.  The simplest such model allows \nthe regression intercept to vary randomly across schools and LEAs (Snijders and Bosker, \n1999: 63-66): \n \nijk\ny\njk\ny\nkjkijk\nT\nijk euvzy \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\n)()(\uf062x\u03b1     (1) \n \nwhere ijkx  is a vector of explanatory variables defined at the pupil, school or LEA level, \u03b1  is \na vector of associated coefficients, jkz  is a measure of school resources with coefficient \uf062 , \nand )( ykv , \n)( y\njku  and ijke  are residuals for LEAs, schools and pupils respectively.  Typically, the \nresiduals are assumed to be normally distributed: ),0(~ 2 )(\n)(\nyv\ny\nk Nv \uf073 , ),0(~\n2\n)(\n)(\nyu\ny\njk Nu \uf073  and \n),0(~ 2 )( yeijk Ne \uf073 .   \n \nA further assumption of the standard multilevel model is that the residuals at each level are \nuncorrelated with the predictor variables ijkx  and jkz .  For the reasons given in Sections 1 \nand 2 above, however, this assumption is questionable because the mechanisms by which \nresources are allocated to schools are likely to be related to the unobserved determinants of \npupil attainment; these unobserved factors may be acting at the school or LEA level or both, \nleading to nonzero correlations between jkz  and either or both of \n)( y\njku  and \n)( y\nkv .   \n \n3.2 A simultaneous equation model for attainment and resource allocation \n \nOne way to allow for the potential endogeneity of resources jkz  with respect to attainment \nijky  is to model the resource allocation process jointly with attainment.  A two-level random \nintercept model for school resources is \n9 \n \n)()( z\njk\nz\nkjk\nT\njk uvz \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d w\u03b3      (2) \n \nwhere jkw  is a vector of explanatory variables defined at the school or LEA level, \u03b3  is a \nvector of coefficients, and )( zjku  and \n)( z\nkv  are school and LEA level residuals with variances \n2\n)( zu\uf073  and \n2\n)( zv\uf073 . \n \nEquations (1) and (2) define a simultaneous equation model.  The equations are linked via the \nschool and LEA residuals and must therefore be estimated jointly.  At each level, we assume \nthat the residuals follow bivariate normal distributions, i.e. ),(~][ 2\n)()(\nu\nTz\njk\ny\njkjk Nuu \u03a90u \uf03d  \nand ),(~][ 2\n)()(\nv\nTz\nk\ny\nkk Nvv \u03a90v \uf03d .  We denote the covariances at the school and LEA level \nby )( yzu\uf073 and \n)( yz\nv\uf073  respectively.  Likelihood ratio tests may be used to test whether either \n)( yz\nu\uf073  or \n)( yz\nv\uf073 , or both, are equal to zero.  A covariance that is significantly different from \nzero implies that jkz  is endogenous, and the nature of the selection effect is given by the \ndirection of the covariance estimate.  \n \n3.2.1 Identification \n \nIn order to identify the simultaneous equation model given by (1) and (2), the vector jkw  \nmust contain at least one variable, called an instrument, which is not contained in ijkx .  To \nqualify as an instrument, a variable must predict the allocation of resources across schools, \nbut should not have a direct effect on attainment. \n \nFinding adequate instruments in this area of research is quite problematic (Burtless, 1996). \nGiven that school funding varies by LEA, and that LEAs are subject to political control, the \npolitical party in control of the local authority is one potential instrument. We argue that \npolitical control of the local authority will affect educational spending in that LEA but will \nnot directly impact on pupil achievement. The first instrument is therefore a variable \nindicating the political control of the local authority, i.e. whether Labour, Conservative, \n10 \nLiberal or other (including no overall political control by one party). The mean raw \nexpenditure per pupil is highest in Liberal and Labour controlled local authorities (\u00a33037 and \n\u00a32980 per pupil respectively), and lowest in Conservative controlled authorities (\u00a32762 per \npupil).  \n \nIt is possible that residents who place greater emphasis on education (and hence whose \nchildren tend to do better in school) will vote for parties that advocate higher educational \nspending. However, residents vote for a party that has policies on a number of different \nissues, not just educational spending. It is not clear that residents will vote purely, or even \nprimarily, on the basis of parties\u2019 educational spending plans, especially as in the UK local \nelections are generally dominated by national politics. It is therefore unlikely that educational \nspending is a major issue in most local elections.  \n \nOur second instrument is lagged school size, which is an instrument that has been used by \nothers in the field (Iacovou, 2002). School size (in terms of pupil numbers) is a key factor \npredicting the per capita level of funding in a school. The correlation between lagged school \nsize and expenditure per pupil is \u20130.30 and significant at the 5% level. The correlation \nbetween lagged school size and the pupil-teacher ratio is +0.11 and significant at the 5% \nlevel.   \n \nFor school size to be an adequate instrument it must not impact directly on pupil \nachievement. In the US, a review by Cotton (1996) could find no evidence that school size \nhas a direct impact on pupil attainment (see also studies such as Griffiths (1996) and Luyten \n(1994)), although there are some US studies that suggest small or medium schools are more \neffective (Lee and Leob, 2000; Borland and Howsen, 1992). As argued by Borland and \n11 \nHowsen (1992), however, many US studies have failed to account for individual pupil ability. \nIn any case the effect of schools size may be institutionally and country specific, particularly \ngiven that processes that determine both funding and the allocation of pupils to schools vary \nby country (and even within countries). \n \nIn the UK, two studies that have relied on school-level data and that do not control for pupil-\nlevel characteristics, have found larger schools to have better pupil attainment (Bradley and \nTaylor, 1998; Barnett et al., 2002). However, studies that have relied on individual-level \nregressions of pupil performance in the UK have not found school size to be a significant \ndeterminant of pupil attainment (Gibbons et al., 2006; Taylor and Nguyen, 2006). Even \nstudies using school-level data such as Bradley et al. (2000) have found small effects. For \nexample, Bradley et al. use school-level data to examine the determinants of school-level \nexam performance, admission numbers, school size and school capacity. They suggested a \nnumber of potential determinants of school size, including demographic factors, prior school \nperformance and the physical capacity of the school, as well as LEA policy. Their empirical \nwork suggested that although higher performing schools did expand at a faster rate, the effect \nwas very small. Generally they concluded that school performance had a minimal effect on \nschool size particularly for large schools, possibly because schools and LEAs are reluctant to \nexpand schools and partly because physical capacity constraints are genuinely binding. \n   \nThus an argument can be made that in the UK context more effective schools tend to be \nbigger because they attract more pupils, thereby causing a positive relationship between \nschool size and pupil achievement. Although empirical evidence from Bradley et al. (2001) \nsuggests this effect is small, in our data we are able to control for this by including an \nindicator of how popular and \u2018full\u2019 the school is as well as a measure of lagged school \n12 \nperformance. (The school\u2019s percentage capacity utilization is calculated as the actual number \nof students in years 7-11 compared to the maximum physical capacity in terms of student \nnumbers, as determined by the Department for Education and Skills.) As a further robustness \ncheck, we also re-estimated our models using lagged school capacity, rather than lagged \nschool size. This was on the grounds that school capacity is simply a function of the physical \nconstruction of the school, unrelated to current pupil enrolment (although Bradley et al. \n(2000) find small positive effects from an excess demand for pupil places on schools\u2019 \nexpansion of their capacity). There is little change in the results when this alternative \ninstrumental variable is used. Our results were also robust to excluding very large and very \nsmall schools from the sample.   \n \nFinally, likelihood ratio tests were used to determine whether the chosen instruments are \nsignificantly related to the school resource measures.  Taking each resource variable as a \ndependent variable, as in (2) above, two models were fitted and compared: the full model \nwith instruments, and the model omitting instruments.  We find that political control of the \nlocal authority and lagged school size are jointly significant predictors of both expenditure \nper pupil and the pupil-teacher ratio (p<0.001 for each resource measure).  \n \n3.2.2 Estimation \n \nThe simultaneous equation model can be framed as a multilevel bivariate response model.  \nFor each individual, we can define a bivariate response rijky  ( r =1, 2) where ijkijk yy \uf03d1  and \njkijk zy \uf03d2 .  In addition, we define two response indicators as follows: \n \n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\njkrijk\nijkrijky\nrijk zy\nyy\nI\nif0\nif1\n)(\n, \n)()( 1 yrijk\nz\nrijk II \uf02d\uf03d . \n \n13 \nEquations (1) and (2) can then be written in the form of a single equation for the stacked \nresponses { rijky } as \n \n.)()()()()(\n)()()()()()()(\nz\nrijk\nz\njk\nz\nrijk\nz\nk\nz\nrijkjk\nT\ny\nrijkijk\ny\nrijk\ny\njk\ny\nrijk\ny\nk\ny\nrijkjk\ny\nrijkijk\nT\nrijk\nIuIvI\nIeIuIvIzIy\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d\nw\u03b3\nx\u03b1 \uf062\n  (3) \n \nThe way in which the responses are stacked is unimportant provided that values of ijky  and \njkz  are sorted by LEA and by school within LEA. In the standard bivariate model, both \nresponses are at the individual level and therefore the bivariate response vector will be of \nlength n2  (Goldstein, 2003; Chapter 6).  In the present case, however, the responses are \ndefined at different levels of the hierarchy: ijky  is a pupil-level response, while jkz  is at the \nschool level.  While we could replicate values of jkz  for pupils in the same school, it is more \ncomputationally efficient to restructure the data so that there is a single observation of jkz  for \neach school, leading to a response vector of length Jn \uf02b with 1\uf02bjkn  records per school.   \nThe explanatory variables in (3) are the two-way interactions between )( yrijkI  and each element \nof ][ jk\nT\nijk zx , and between \n)( z\nrijkI  and the elements of \nT\njkw .  The random effects in the \nattainment and resource equations are fitted by allowing the coefficient of )( yrijkI  to vary across \npupils, schools and LEAs, and the coefficient of )( zrijkI  to vary across schools and LEAs. \n \nWe estimated model (3) using reweighted iterative generalised least squares (RIGLS) as \nimplemented in  MLwiN v2.0 (Rasbash et al., 2004). \n \n4. Data \n \nThe data for this paper come largely from the National Pupil Data Base (NPDB) and the \nPupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC). The NPDB contains information on pupil \nachievement as they progress through the school system, including their scores on the various \ntests taken at Key Stage 1 (age 7) through to Key Stage 4 (GCSE). NPDB information on \nindividual pupils is merged into PLASC, which contains data on school characteristics (size, \n14 \ntype, pupil-teacher ratio etc.) and pupil characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, eligibility for \nfree school meals etc.). (Further information on the NPDB\/PLASC datasets and how to \naccess them can be found at http:\/\/www.bris.ac.uk\/Depts\/CMPO\/PLUG\/whatisplug.htm.) We \nthen merged additional data into NPDB\/PLASC on school expenditure (from Department for \nEducation and Skills Section 52 data) and political control of the local authority, as well as \n2001 Census information on the socio-economic characteristics of each child\u2019s \nneighbourhood.  The analysis sample contains 430,061 pupils who are nested within 2,950 \nschools in 147 local education authorities. \n \nOur model estimates the impact of school resources on pupil achievement in English, \nmathematics and science at age 14, i.e. Key Stage 3 in 2002\/3. We include as an explanatory \nvariable each pupil\u2019s prior achievement at Key Stage 2 (age 11) on entry to secondary school, \ni.e. in 1999\/2000. The dependent variables are the age 14 test scores.  The raw scores vary \nfrom 0 to almost 9 for maths, and from 0 up to almost 8 for science and English; standardised \nscores were used in the analysis.   \n \nThe resource variables we use are all at school level, namely expenditure per pupil (deflated \nby an indicator of the cost of living in the area, the Area Cost Adjustment), the average pupil \nteacher ratio in the school and the ratio of pupils to non-teaching staff.  The resource \nvariables were averaged over the three years that the sample was in secondary school. We \nestimated separate models for the expenditure and the staffing resource variables, since the \nmajority of school spending is on teachers. Teacher salary costs are on average 61% of \nsecondary schools\u2019 expenditure (OFSTED, 2003). If expenditure per pupil and the pupil-\nteacher ratio are included in the same model, then the effect of the pupil-teacher ratio is \nbiased downwards because a lower pupil-teacher ratio for a given level of spending \n15 \nautomatically implies that there are less resources available for other inputs (Todd and \nWolpin, 2003).   \n \nWe control for a range of pupil and school variables (details given in the Appendix), as \ndescribed in Leva\u010di\u0107 et al. (2005). In particular, in the attainment models we control for the \nprior achievement of the pupil at Key Stage 2 (age 11).  Thus we are estimating a model of \nthe impact of resources on pupil progress between age 11 and age 14. Including pupil prior \nachievement also allows for observable pupil-level selection processes that may cause more \nor less able pupils to be selected into different schools, as discussed earlier. We also control \nfor pupils\u2019 gender, age, whether they have any special educational needs, whether they are \neligible for free school meals and their ethnicity.  \n \nAt the school level, we have a rich set of controls that are included in both the attainment and \nthe resource equations, including various descriptors of school type, gender and age mix of \nthe school, as well as the socio-economic status of the school as measured by the proportion \nof children eligible for free school meals. In addition we include in the resource equations a \nmeasure of lagged school performance, i.e. the proportion of pupils achieving 5+ grade A*-C \nGCSEs in 1999, which predates the point at which this cohort of pupils entered the school. \nThis is included to account for the fact that, in general, higher levels of resources are \nallocated to lower performing schools.  Lastly, in the attainment model we also include a \nnumber of controls derived from the 2001 Census, which are designed to capture \ncharacteristics of the pupil\u2019s neighbourhood. For example, we control for the proportion \nunemployed in the pupil\u2019s postcode area. These Census controls are particularly useful given \nthe rather limited measures of socio-economic background for the individual.  Full \ndescriptive statistics are given in Table 1. \n16 \n \n5. Results \n \nWe begin by examining the extent to which pupil attainment scores are clustered within \nschools and LEAs, and school resources are clustered within LEAs.  Table 2 shows estimates \nof the residual variance at each level, from which estimates of the intra-school and intra-LEA \ncorrelations have been calculated.  The estimates for attainment are from fitting separate \nthree-level models for attainment at age 14 in maths, science and English, adjusting for \nattainment at age 11 in the same subjects.  Thus the variance components represent the \nvariances at each level in the progress between entry into secondary school and age 14.  The \nestimates for school resources are from fitting separate two-level models to the expenditure \nand staffing measures.  At this stage of the analysis, no pupil or school characteristics have \nbeen included, with the exception of prior attainment in the achievement models.   \n \nIn a random intercept model, the intra-LEA (school) correlation can be interpreted as the \nproportion of the total variance that is due to differences between LEAs (schools), or the \ncorrelation between the expected progress of two randomly selected pupils from the same \nLEA (school). The intra-school correlations for attainment show that there are moderate \nschool effects on adjusted performance in all three subjects, with the strongest effect on \nEnglish scores; 22% of the total variance in English progress is due to differences between \nschools.  After taking into account school effects on progress, LEA effects are very weak. \nTurning to the school resource measures, we find that 16% of the total variance in \nexpenditure per pupil can be explained by differences between LEAs.  This moderately high \nintra-LEA correlation implies that while LEAs vary in their mean expenditure per pupil \n(averaging across all schools in an LEA), there is similarity in the expenditure of schools in \nthe same LEA.  There is rather less homogeneity within LEAs in pupil-teacher ratios. This is \na reflection of the fact that, whilst overall per pupil spending in each school is determined at \nLEA level, schools themselves have much more discretion over how this money is spent, and \nin particular they have some control over the pupil-teacher ratio in each class and year in the \nschool. \n \nWe next consider the evidence for the endogeneity of school resources with respect to pupil \nattainment.  Table 3 shows the results from likelihood ratio tests comparing, for each subject \nand resource measure, a standard multilevel model and a simultaneous equation model.  All \n17 \nmodels include a number of controls for pupil background and school characteristics, as \ndescribed in Section 4. In the standard model, the covariances between the school and LEA \nresiduals across the attainment and resource equations are constrained to equal zero, while in \nthe simultaneous equation model these covariances are freely estimated.  Thus we are testing \nthe null hypothesis that 0)()( \uf03d\uf03d yzv\nyz\nu \uf073\uf073 , which is a test of the exogeneity of the relationship \nbetween attainment and resources.  Rejection of the null implies that school resources are \nendogenous to attainment, in which case estimates of the impact of resources on attainment \nfrom the standard multilevel model will be biased.  We find strong evidence that both per \npupil expenditure and the pupil-teacher ratio are endogenous to attainment in science.  There \nis also evidence that staffing and, at the 10% level, expenditure are endogenous to maths \nattainment. We conclude, however, that both resource variables are exogenous to English \nattainment.  \n \nHaving established that both of our school resource indicators are endogenous to attainment \nin maths and science, we can examine estimates of the residual correlations to assess the \ndirection of selection effects and whether they operate at the school or LEA level or both.  \nThe correlation at the LEA level is interpreted as the (residual) association between the LEA \nmean level of resources (expenditure or staffing) and LEA mean attainment.  A strong \ncorrelation at this level would suggest a selection effect that is driven by the way in which \ncentral government allocates resources to local authorities. The residual correlation at the \nschool level measures the within-LEA association between school resources and school mean \nattainment.  A strong correlation at the school level implies a selection effect that is due to the \nnature of resource allocation among schools within an LEA, i.e. non-random allocation \nwithin LEAs.  A dominant LEA-level correlation would suggest that selection is largely the \nresult of central government policy and political choice at local level, as Conservative LEAs \ntend to be lower spending authorities.   \n \nTable 4 shows estimates of the correlation between the school and LEA residuals across the \nresource and attainment equations in the simultaneous equation model. We discuss only the \ninterpretation of the correlations between resources and attainment in maths and science, \nsince exogeneity tests (Table 3) suggest that resources may be assumed exogenous to English \nscores. The school and LEA-level correlations between the residuals for expenditure per \npupil and attainment in maths and science are negative; these correlations are strongest for \n18 \nscience and, for both subjects, the LEA-level correlation is the largest.  A negative correlation \nat the LEA level implies that unobserved LEA factors influencing school expenditure are \nnegatively correlated with the unobserved LEA-level determinants of pupil attainment.  \nEquivalently we may conclude that, even after controlling for a rich set of explanatory \nvariables, there is a negative association between the mean level of expenditure in an LEA \nand the LEA mean attainment.  A negative selection effect is consistent with the policy of \ncompensatory funding where schools with greater learning needs receive more funding per \npupil (see Section 2). The evidence suggests that the selection effect is stronger at the LEA \nlevel, which is as one would expect, given that the expenditure for education that is \nnotionally allocated to each LEA (the education Standard Spending Assessment discussed in \nSection 2) is determined by central government on the basis of a formula that explicitly \nincludes many factors likely to be highly correlated with pupil attainment. For example, \ncentral government takes the following factors into account when determining the level of \neach LEA's education SSA: the proportion of immigrants in the area, the proportion of the \nresident population on benefits and indicators of deprivation.  The selection effect is greatest \nfor science, particularly at LEA level. It appears that the socio-economic factors that \ndetermine each LEA's allocation for expenditure on education are also more highly correlated \nwith science achievement. Further investigation is required as to why this might be the case \nbut our results clearly indicate that resourcing effects vary across subjects.  \n \nThe residual correlations between maths and science attainment and the pupil-teacher ratio \nfollow a similar pattern to those for attainment and expenditure, although the correlations are \nnow positive because a high pupil-teacher ratio is an indicator of lower resources.   However, \nthe correlations at both levels are stronger than for expenditure, particularly at the school \nlevel. The fact that the selection effect is greater for the pupil-teacher ratio, as compared to \nexpenditure, indicates that there is more autonomy for schools to determine how they spend \ntheir resources. The large positive selection effect is consistent with the widely held view that \neducation professionals tend to allocate poorer performing pupils into smaller class sizes. \nThis phenomenon may also occur at LEA and school level, whereby schools with lower \nperforming pupils either are allocated or opt for lower pupil teacher ratios. This would come \nabout by LEAs systematically attempting to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in their most \ndisadvantaged schools and by schools with disadvantaged pupils opting to have a lower \npupil-teacher ratio for a given level of expenditure, as compared to their more prosperous \ncounterparts.  \n19 \n \nIn Table 5 we demonstrate the impact of adjusting for endogeneity on estimates of the effects \nof school resources on pupil attainment.  For each subject and resource indicator, \nstandardised coefficients are presented for two models: the standard multilevel model \ndenoted in (1), which assumes that resources are exogenous, and the simultaneous equation \nmodel denoted jointly by (1) and (2), which allows for endogenous resource effects.  Based \non the results from either model, we would predict a statistically significant, though small, \nimprovement in pupils\u2019 maths and science progress for an increase in the expenditure per \npupil or a decrease in the pupil-teacher ratio, et ceteris paribus. When we allow for \nendogeneity, however, the magnitude of these effects increases substantially.  The increase in \neffect size is expected due the nature of selection implied by the direction of the residual \ncorrelations between resources and attainment (Table 4).   \n \nTo assess the effects of school resources on English attainment, we may interpret the \nestimates from the standard multilevel model due to the lack of significance of the residual \ncorrelations in the simultaneous equation model (Table 3).  We find a counter-intuitive \nnegative effect of expenditure per pupil on English progress, and no significant effect of the \npupil-teacher ratio. It has been suggested that the school environment has a lesser effect on \nprogress in English than in other subjects, partly because the home environment is relatively \nmore important in determining language development. This might explain why the pupil-\nteacher ratio does not have a significant impact on pupil progress in English, particularly at \nthe relative low levels of pupil-teacher ratio found in the English education system (relative \nto world standards). However, it does not explain why expenditure might be negatively \nrelated to English progress.  \n \n6. Discussion \n \nThis paper has adopted a multilevel simultaneous equation modelling approach to determine \nthe impact of school resources on pupil attainment at age 14. The primary objective of the \npaper was to determine whether additional expenditure on education would lead to improved \npupil attainment, clearly an important issue for policy makers attempting to raise standards in \neducation and improve the performance of low achieving groups. The paper, building on \nprevious work using an instrumental variable approach (Leva\u010di\u0107 et al., 2005), addresses a \nnumber of methodological difficulties in this literature, in particular the endogeneity of \n20 \nschool resource levels, and the intra-school correlations in pupil responses.    \n \nIn policy terms our results suggest the following. First, additional resources do have a \npositive impact on attainment in mathematics and science but not for English. These positive \nresource effects are particularly strong once we account for the endogeneity of school \nresources, i.e. once we allow for the fact that in the UK education system more resources are \nsystematically allocated to LEAs and schools that have lower attaining pupils. The magnitude \nof the effects from the simultaneous equation model suggest that an additional \u00a31000 per \npupil in the funding level would increase pupil achievement by on average 0.07 of a level in \nmathematics and just under 0.2 of a level in science. In contrast, a reduction in the pupil \nteacher ratio of one would increase pupil achievement by between 0.12 and 0.13 of a level in \nmathematics and science. To put these potential increases in achievement into context, pupils \nare expected to improve their achievement by 0.5 of a level each year. Thus one can conclude \nthat these resource effects are important but relatively modest. As has already been discussed \na related and important policy question is how the impact of additional resources on \neducational attainment may differ across different types of student, e.g. those from lower \nsocio-economic backgrounds, different ethnic groups and such like. These questions are \naddressed in Leva\u010di\u0107 et al. (2005). \n \nFrom a policy perspective, this suggests that better funded schools, and those with lower \npupil-teacher ratios, have higher pupil attainment ceteris paribus than schools with lower \nlevels of resources. The magnitude of the effects suggests that policies to reduce pupil-\nteacher ratios in secondary schools may be particularly effective, particularly for improving \npupil attainment in science and mathematics. This is reassuring for policy-makers as it \nsuggests that schools do use resources efficiently, at least to some extent, in that we find a \nsystematic positive relationship between resource inputs and pupil outcomes for science and \nmathematics. However, we find insignificant or even negative resource effects for English. In \nother words, we find no evidence that schools and LEAs that have higher levels of \nexpenditure per pupil and lower pupil-teacher ratios have better pupil attainment in English. \nThis might imply that schools are not efficient in their use of resources in English. However, \nan alternative possibility is that family background and home environment play a more \nimportant role in determining attainment in English, and that we are unable to fully model \nthis process with the available data. This latter suggestion is conjecture at this point and the \nissue clearly merits further research.  An alternative suggestion is that the KS3 English tests \n21 \nare a poorer measure of pupils\u2019 \u2018real\u2019 attainment in English than in science and maths. There \nis some support for this from the fact that English KS3 is not as well predicted by English \nKS2, as are Maths and science at KS3 by their respective subjects at KS2.  \n \nThe first strong methodological message from this paper is that any analysis of the \nrelationship between school resources and pupil attainment needs to allow fully for both \nvariation in resource effects across different subjects and for the endogeneity of resource \nallocation. The magnitude of the resource effects is considerably larger once endogeneity is \nallowed for, indicating that studies that do not allow for endogeneity will have estimates that \nare biased downwards. \n \nThe paper also makes another important methodological contribution to the literature. \nGenerally the standard instrumental variable method used in this literature to overcome the \nendogeneity of school resources assumes that any selection bias is operating at the lowest \nlevel of observation. In this paper we allow for selection at both the level of the school and \nthe level of the LEA. In the analysis this turns out to be important as there is selection at both \nLEA and school level. Furthermore, the extent of the selection bias varies by subject and by \nthe nature of the resource variable being considered. Specifically, the school and LEA-level \ncorrelations between the residuals for expenditure per pupil and attainment in maths and \nscience are negative, are particularly strong for science and are larger at the LEA-level.  What \nthis result implies is that resource allocation in the UK education system is compensatory, i.e. \ndisadvantaged schools and LEAs have higher levels of spending. Furthermore, there is strong \nselection at the LEA level, reflecting the fact that central government determines the amount \nallocated to each LEA to spend on education on the basis of a number of socio-economic \nindicators of disadvantage, many of which are also negatively correlated with pupil \nattainment. In terms of the pupil-teacher ratio, the correlations at both school and LEA level \nare stronger than for expenditure, particularly at the school level. The fact that the selection \neffect is greater for the pupil-teacher ratio is explained by the fact that schools themselves \nhave much discretion over how this money is spent and disadvantaged schools may be more \nlikely to use their expenditure to reduce their pupil-teacher ratio.  In conclusion, in models \nthat do not allow for this endogeneity, or only allow for selection at the level of the school, an \nimportant source of selection bias will be ignored.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n22 \nWe are very grateful for the helpful comments made by the Joint Editor, Antony Fielding, \nand two referees. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAngrist, J., and Lavy, V.

There are ten areas of specialism: arts, business & \nenterprise, engineering, humanities, languages, mathematics & computing, music, science, sports and \ntechnology. Specialist schools have a focus on those subjects relating to their chosen specialism but must also \nmeet the National Curriculum requirements and deliver a broad and balanced education to all pupils. \n  \nx A school judged by inspectors to be \"failing or likely to fail to give its pupils an acceptable standard of \neducation\" (Schools Inspection Act, 1996). \n \nxi The Beacon Schools programme was established in 1998. It identified high performing schools  \nacross England (designated as beacon schools) and was designed to build partnerships between these schools \nand represent examples of successful practice, with a view to sharing and spreading that effective practice to \nother schools to raise standards in pupil attainment. \n \nxii Leading edge partnerships: A central government programme which provides funding for partnerships \nbetween schools.  The programme encourages partnerships between high-performing schools and weaker \nschools with the objective of raising standards.  \n \nxiii Leadership incentive grants: A central government programme which was designed to strengthen \nleadership within schools, particularly in deprived areas.  The programme provided additional funding and \nencouraged collaboration between schools.   \n \nxiv\n Teachers\u2019 pay relative to average gross weekly full-time earnings.
