Introduction\nMOVEMENT related brain activity has been studied formany years by means of readiness potentials (RPs) [1].\nThe RP is typically recorded during execution of self-paced\nvoluntary movements. The contralaterally dominant part of\nmovement related brain activity preceding movement is called\nlateralized readiness potential (LRP) [2]. This may be com-\nputed by subtraction of slow EEG potentials recorded ipsi-\nlaterally to the side of movement from potentials recorded\ncontralaterally, followed by averaging of resultant potentials\nassociated with left and right finger movements [3]. Temporal\nand spatial characteristics of averaged RPs and LRPs have\nbeen well investigated in cognitive and clinical neuroscience\nstudies [1], [4].\nAsymmetric RPs during discrete finger movements are\nreadily recordable from almost all subjects, i.e. see [1] where\nManuscript received September 03, 2008; revised January 26, 2009; revised\nApril 03, 2009.

Sanei is with the Centre of Digital Signal Processing, School of\nEngineering, Cardi\u000b University, Cardi\u000b CF24 3AA, UK.\npioneering studies showed that RP can be detected several\nhundred milliseconds prior to an overt movement. It has been\nconcluded [1], [5], [6] that the asymmetric spatial distribution\nof these scalp potentials reflects motor preparation for a spe-\ncific e\u000bector. The simple nature of RP signals has made them\nfairly e\u000bective for BCI applications [7], [8]. For instance, the\nBerlin and Tu\u00a8bingen BCI research groups have achieved above\n90% correct binary classification rates [7]\u2013[11] by developing\nvarious methodological and mathematical techniques. Despite\nthe outstanding BCI performances by means of RPs, the use of\nsuch an approach is limited when compared to the P300- and\nthe \u0016 rhythm-based BCI protocols. There are several issues\nlimiting the applicability of RPs; first, the inevitable DC drifts\nin EEG measurements due to sweating or electrode displace-\nments, especially if the experiments become lengthy. Second,\nseveral low frequency artifacts such as postural changes, respi-\nration and DC drifts within short data windows of 0.5 second\nlength before the movement onset reduce the signal (RP) to\nnoise ratio. In addition, after segmenting the recorded EEGs, a\nbaseline removal stage is needed [8]. Although finding a short\nreference interval can be straightforward in o\u000fine analysis,\nthe identification of such a reference interval within the online\nEEG stream is troublesome in real-time applications. Another\nproblem arises from the nature of the RP: in order to allow\nthe RP build up over time, the inter-movement interval should\nbe several seconds [1]. Recent BCI studies, such as in [8],\n[12], have attempted to modify the conventional RP-based BCI\nparadigms by instructing the subjects to tap at faster paces\nthan usual. The information transfer rate (ITR) - measured in\nbits per minute (bpm) [13], [14] - was increased. However,\nfaster tapping led to decrement of the correct classification\nrates (CCRs). For instance, as reported in [12], in binary\nclassification of RP features, the mis-classification increased\nfrom 5% (ITR [bpm] \u0019 18.6) to 19% (ITR [bpm] \u0019 52.9) when\nthe inter-tap intervals (ITI) dropped from 2 to 0.5 seconds.\nAn alternative approach for BCI based on ssMRPs is\npresented here which overcomes the above di\u000eculties and pro-\nvides desirable classification rates in a high ITR framework.\nIt does not imply any extra computational load and therefore,\nits real-time implementation is possible.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we first\nbriefly review the conventional applications of brain steady-\nstate visual evoked potentials (ssVEP) for BCI. The main\nmotivation and the neurological background of using ssMRPs\nfor BCI applications are then presented. In Section III, we\npropose an e\u000bective ssMRP recording protocol suitable for\nreal-time BCI applications and explain the two experiments\nwe carried out. Then, the pre-processing, feature extraction,\n2and classifier design stages are described. Section IV reports\nthe results where the spatio-temporal characteristics of the av-\neraged ssMRPs will be first presented. We subsequently report\nthe results of our BCI scheme during the movement initiation\nand the synchronization states and also during the course of the\ntrials. We further investigate the e\u000bect of the time window size\non the BCI performance in Section IV-C. In Section IV-D, we\nconsider the e\u000bect of the co-existing transient visual evoked\npotentials (VEPs) on ssMRP measurements. The applicability\nof ssMRP-based BCI in real-life rehabilitation problems and\nits extension to motor imagery BCI are then discussed in this\nsection. Moreover in section IV-F, we investigate how success-\nful the subjects are in maintaining the correct rhythm when\nthe taps are carried out without the visual cues. Section V\npresents the concluding remarks.\nII. Brain Steady-State Potentials for BCI\nConventionally, in steady-state potential based BCI, users\nare exposed to rhythmic visual or audio cues. For instance, in\nthe increasingly important steady-state visual evoked poten-\ntials (ssVEP)-based BCI system, bilaterally distributed visually\nevoked brain potentials are recorded from the visual cortex.\nSince the fundamental frequency of the stimulation [15],\n[16] and its first few harmonics [17] are dominant spectral\ncomponents of the recorded EEG, multi-class BCIs may be\nrealized without extensive subject training [18]. In an ssVEP-\nbased BCI, in order to have an output the user has to shift their\ngaze to the flashing stimulation corresponding to the task of\ninterest and hence the BCI would be limited to recovering eye\nposition or the direction of attention1. The ssVEP-based BCIs\nmay potentially be unpleasant for the users who have to attend\nthe repetitive high-frequency (usually about 10 Hz) flashing\nvisual stimuli for the BCI to generate continuous outputs.\nThe objective of this paper is therefore, to introduce a high\nperformance BCI methodology based on steady-state finger\nmovement related potentials, independent of eye direction. In\nthis approach, low-frequency (2 Hz) flashing visual stimuli\nare exploited and the subjects are asked to tap in synchrony\nwith them rather than to gaze at them. It has been shown [1]\nthat readiness potentials of about 2 Hz are EEG correlates\nof voluntary movement preparation. Therefore, as a prime\ncandidate we used this frequency. Repp [20] in his extensive\nbehavioral experiments has shown that sensorimotor synchro-\nnization to visual cues of up to maximum 3 Hz is possible.\nHowever, when audio signals are used the synchronization\nmay be maintained up to relatively higher frequencies of up\nto 7-8 Hz. However, in the BCI context it is fair to say that\nssMRPs do not have the broad frequency range of ssVEPs\nand whether EEG potentials generated by tapping with higher\nfrequencies would be classifiable on the single-trial basis is\nsubject to further research.\nExecution of simple unimanual repetitive finger movements\nis associated with activity within the Rolandic fissure of the\ncontralateral hemisphere corresponding to the primary senso-\nrimotor cortex [21]. Our extensive behavioral neuroimaging\n1Recently, Kelly et al. in [19] have reported a ssVEP-based BCI indepen-\ndent from gaze direction by classification of VEPs recorded during visual\nspatial attention.\nstudies on rhythmic movements have led to the hypothesis that\nthere are distinct brain structures which perform automatic vs.\ncognitively controlled timing for repetitive movements [22],\n[23]. The automatic control (AC) system is primarily involved\nin continuous movements with frequencies greater than 1\nHz, i.e. sub-second intervals. It is likely to employ neural\nassemblies within the primary motor system. Furthermore, we\nhave concluded that once a fast rhythmic task is selected and\ninitiated, it may be executed without direct attention [24]. The\ntiming control of a continuous series of fast and predictable\nmovements should therefore require attention merely during\nthe selection and initiation phases. On the other hand, the\ncognitively controlled (CC) timing system is more exploited\nin controlling movements at intervals much longer than 1s, i.e.\nat < 1 Hz frequencies. The CC timing structure requires the\nactivation of additional lateralized prefrontal and parietal lobe\nstructures.\nSchaal et al. in [25] have verified that in discrete single-joint\nmovements higher brain functions such as working memory\n(the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), recall (the ventrolateral\nprefrontal cortex), and attention (the intraparietal sulcus and\ninferior parietal lobe) may be involved. In contrast, rhythmic\nmovements show much less cerebral activity; the only sig-\nnificantly active region is the contralateral motor cortex. Intu-\nitively, one would assign the AC system for timing of rhythmic\nmovements and the CC systems for discrete movements.\nConventionally in BCI, subjects are instructed to move\n(imagine the movement of) their finger on a discrete-time\nbasis. In contrast, it is hypothesized here that during fast\nrhythmic finger tapping, the AC timing system is involved and\nhence ssMRPs are confined to the contralateral sensorimotor\ncortex. This, in turn, implies that non-rhythmic motor related\nactivities emanating from frontal cortex will be attenuated.\nTherefore, if a motor task is carried out (real or imaginary)\nsynchronized to a rhythmic (2 Hz) stimulus, the neural re-\nsponses (ssMRPs) will oscillate at the same frequency and\nhence, there should be a peak in the power spectrum of the\nrecorded EEGs at the frequency of the oscillatory cue (and\npossibly its harmonics). Interestingly, this peak can represent\na carrier frequency by which the EEGs are modulated. If\nthe oscillations shows stronger amplitudes on the hemisphere\ncontralateral to the moving finger, the ssMRP can be regarded\nas a potential signal for BCI applications.\nIII. Method\nTwo experiments were conducted to test the ssMRP-based\nBCI in practice. First, we recorded ssMRPs during repetitive\nreal finger movements. In the second experiment, we further\ninvestigated the potential and limitations of the ssMRPs-based\nBCI. Specifically, we address the three following issues. First,\nwe document the transient e\u000bect of the visually evoked poten-\ntials (VEP) caused by repetitive visual stimuli on the proposed\nBCI system. Second, we discuss how the proposed method is\nextensible to imagined movements. The classification scores of\nEEGs recorded during imagined rhythmic movement are pre-\nsented following a short overview of the rhythmic modulation\nof cortical potentials by imagined tapping. Third, repetition\n3Each Trial - 7 s\n     1 s\nFixation\n     +\n                   6 s\nFinger Tapping wth Cue\n             X     +     X\nFig. 1. Temporal structure of each trial; first dataset.\nof a movement at an exact pace usually relies on an external\nstimulus - at least in the initiation and synchronization stages.\nThis limitation can constrain the \u201creal-life\u201d applicability of the\nssMRP-based BCI machines. We therefore recorded ssMRPs\nbut without presenting the visual cues to objectively investigate\nto what extent a learnt pace can be maintained. EEG analysis,\ni.e. pre-processing and classification, in these two scenarios\nare the same as those addressed in experiment I.\nA. Experiment 1: Real Movements\nFive right-handed healthy individuals (one female) (age 33\u0006\n9) participated in the first experiment. They had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision, with no apparent motor problems,\nand no previous BCI experience. All gave informed consent.\nSubjects I and III had previous musical training.\nIn this experiment EEG signals were recorded during rhyth-\nmic left or right finger tapping. The experiment was run in a\nquiet, normally illuminated room. The participants were seated\ncomfortably in an armchair with the forearms placed on the\narmrests of the chair. Two force transducers were attached\nto the armrests, on top of which the participants held their\nindex fingers of each hand. The stimuli were presented in\nwhite against a grey background on a 17 inch monitor at a\nresolution of 800 \u0002 600. The viewing distance was set to 100\ncm.\nThe Ag\/AgCl scalp electrodes were placed according to\nthe 10-5 system [26] using a carefully positioned nylon cap.\nThe EEG potentials were recorded continuously with 128\nelectrodes relative to an (o\u000b-line) averaged left and right mas-\ntoid reference. The eye-movements and blinks were monitored\nby bipolar horizontal and vertical electro-oculogram (EOG)\nderivations. The EEG and EOG signals were amplified with a\nbandpass of 0-128 Hz using a BioSemi Active-Two amplifier\nand sampled at 512 Hz.\nEach of five subjects first underwent a practice block of\n20 trials. The main recording session comprised of eight\nblocks, each contained 40 trials, resulting in 320 trials for\nfurther analysis. The trial temporal structure is illustrated in\nFig. 1. Each trial lasted 7 seconds which included one second\nfor initial fixation and another 6 seconds for EEG recording\nduring rhythmic tapping. In the first second of each trial a\nfixation cross \u201c+\u201d was shown in the center of the screen.\nSubsequently, while the cross was kept constant in the center,\ntwo rhythmically flashing \u201cX\u201ds appeared at the left and right\nsides of the cross for 6 seconds; each was 10 cm away\nfrom the center. The flashing frequency was set to 2 Hz. The\nparticipants were instructed to tap on one of the force sensors\nunder left or right index fingers at a constant rate of 2 Hz in\ntime with the flashing cues.

Temporal structure of each trial; second dataset.\nwas approximately one and half seconds, randomly changing\nwith a variance of 150 milliseconds, so that the subjects would\nnot guess the start of next trial. The choice between right or\nleft finger tapping was made freely by the participants in each\ntrial. However, they were asked to be fair between right and\nleft responses. Therefore, on average we collected almost equal\nnumber of trials in each class across subjects.\nThe main reason for showing the flashing cues was to give\nthe subjects a 2 Hz pace. Equidistant visual cues on either side\nfrom the center should not cause asymmetrically distributed\npotentials over the motor cortex. Moreover, the subjects were\nasked to maintain fixation on the central cross during the\ncourse of tapping. Later in Section IV-D, we show how\neye-fixation and inattention to the cues should attenuate the\nstimulus-driven VEPs. Force transducers were utilized instead\nof conventional response switches in order to provide a setup\nin which the subjects did not actually press any switch, just\nperformed repetitive tapping, which maintained the continuity\nof the repetitive finger movement.\nB. Experiment 2: Imaginary Movements\nIn this experiment we investigated ssMRPs generated during\nimaginary movements. One right-handed healthy male (age\n32) who did not have any BCI experience took part in this\nstudy; he had not participated in the first experiment. The\nEEG recording hardware setup was as described earlier in\nSection III-A. The recording session was comprised of eight\nblocks, each contained 30 trials, resulting in 240 trials for\nfurther analysis; almost equal number of trials for left and\nright fingers were recorded. This subject also first underwent\na practice block of 20 trials.\nThe trial temporal structure is illustrated in Fig. 2. Each\ntrial lasted 12 seconds which included 2 seconds for initial\nfixation and 2 second for synchronizing the correct 2 Hz\npace with the visual cues. Next followed a 3 second period\nwhen imagined rhythmic finger movement were carried out.\nNext came another 3 second period when the subject was\ninstructed to make real tapping movement, but without the\nrhythmic visual cues on the screen. In the final 2 seconds, the\nvisual cues re-appeared on the screen to give a feedback on\nsynchronization. The subject was asked to continue tapping in\ntime with the cues; this data was not analyzed. Throughout the\n12 seconds the fixation cross was maintained in the middle of\nthe screen and the participant was asked to maintain fixation\nthroughout the trial. Note that the switching time between the\nthird stage (imagination of movement) and the fourth stage\n(real tapping without cue), was instructed to the subject by\nreplacing the central fixation cross \u201c+\u201d with an \u201cX\u201d for 100\nmilliseconds.\n4CP5   \nCPP5h \nCCP5h \nCP3   \nCPP3h \nCCP3h \nCP1   \nCPP1h \nCPz   \nCPP2h CPP4h \nCP2   \nCCP4h \nCP4   \nCPP6h \nCCP6h \nCP6   \nFC5   \nFCC5h \nC5    C3    \nFCC3h \nFC3   FC1   \nC1    \nCCP1h \nCz    \nFCC1h \nFCz   \nFFC1h FFC2h \nFC2   \nFCC2h \nCCP2h \nC2    C4    \nFCC4h \nFC4   FC6   \nFCC6h \nC6    \nFFC5h FFC3h FFC4h FFC6h \nFig. 3. The 45 electrodes over the sensorimotor cortex which were included\nin the classification.\nC. Preprocessing\nThe EEG preprocessing was performed o\u000b-line using Brain-\nVision Analyzer, Brain Products GmbH. Continuous EEG\nrecordings were o\u000b-line segmented in epochs from 1-7 s after\nthe trial onset in the first and 2-10 s in the second set of\nmeasurements. Specifically, we followed a dual-stage artifact\nrejection procedure: first, all trials in which the absolute\ndi\u000berence between the maximum and minimum values of\neach vertical EOG channels was greater than 100 \u0016V were\nrejected. Then, we visually searched and rejected the trials in\nwhich other artifacts, e.g. body\/eye movements or electrode\ndisplacements, were evident.\nOn average respectively, 15% and 10% of trials were\nrejected in the first and second experiments. Multi-channel\nEEG measurements from scalp electrodes were then narrow\nbandpass filtered between 1.5-2.5 Hz. The preprocessed EEG\nsegments, on average, almost equal number of trials in each\nclass per subject were exported to Matlab, for the single trial\nfeature extraction and classification stages.\nD. Feature Extraction\nPreprocessed trials from 45 electrode signals over the senso-\nrimotor cortex area were considered; Fig. 3 depicts these elec-\ntrodes. Each trial was temporally sub-segmented into several\noverlapping windows. The energies of the bandpassed EEG\nrecordings were computed in each data window and the feature\nvectors were constructed. The energy features are approxi-\nmately chi-square distributed, therefore, taking the logarithm\nmakes them almost Gaussian distributed and a linear second\norder statistics-based classifier such as FLD, see Section III-E,\nis expected to perform better [27]. Therefore, the classification\noperations were repeated using the log-energy features of\nEEGs. The left and right finger movement classification was\nperformed after the feature space dimension reduction using\nprincipal component analysis (PCA).\nIn a further step, in order to accentuate the localized activity\nand reduce volume conduction e\u000bects in multi-channel EEG,\nthe current source density (CSD) transform (available in the\nBrainVision Analyzer software) was used before computing\nthe features of preprocessed signals. We expect that imple-\nmentation of the CSD before the feature extracting stage would\nincrease the classifier performance.\nE. Classifier Design\nThe linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on\nthe Fisher\u2019s ratio [28] is utilized here mainly due to its simple\ncomputations. For a two-class classification problem, assume\nthat the training patterns is given as X = fx1; x2; \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ; xlg =\nfX1;X2g \u001a \u0092N where the elements of X1 = fx11; x12; \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ; x1l1 g\nbelong to class L1 and similarly X2 = fx21; x22; \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 ; x2l2 g contains\npatterns from L2. The FLD computes a vector w to maximize\nthe between-class distance while minimizing the within-class\ndistance of the feature samples by a linear mapping as f (x) =\nhw:xi + b, where h:i denotes inner product operator. Vector\nw may be computed by maximizing the class separability\ncriterion J(w);\nw = max\nw\nJ(w) = max\nw\nw0SBw\nw0SWw\n(1)\nwhere SB and SW are respectively the between and within class\nscatter matrices. The bias b of the linear rule is determined\nusing hw:m1i + b = \u0000(hw:m2i + b) and the solution to (1) is\nw = SW\u00001(m1 \u0000m2); see [28].\nIV. Results\nThe results of each experiment are reported separately\nhere. For the first experiment, the averaged ssMRPs are first\npresented. We subsequently report the results of our BCI\nscheme during the movement initiation and the synchroniza-\ntion states and also during the course of the trials. The e\u000bect\nof the time window size on the BCI performance is then\ninvestigated in Section IV-C. We also report the e\u000bect of\nthe co-existing transient visual evoked potentials (VEPs) on\nthe ssMRP measurement, ssMRP extension to motor imagery\nBCI, and separability of ssMRP-based BCI generated without\npresenting the visual cues.\nA. Topographic Analysis of the Averaged EEG Recordings\nOf primary interest was the ssMRPs developed during\nrhythmic tapping. Therefore, bandpass filtered (1.5-2.5 Hz)\nand current source density (CSD) [29] transformed EEGs\nrecorded during repetitive left and right finger movement trials\nfrom the representative subject I were used to visualize the\nssMRPs in the time domain. The respective topographic maps,\nFig. 4 and Fig. 5, show a rapid development of lateralized\nrhythmic activity over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex.\nTopographical maps show snapshots of the spatial distribution\nof the ssMRPs every 250 ms, that is, at peaks and troughs of\n2 Hz rhythm.\nB. Classification during Initiation of Rhythmic Tapping\nThe experiment was designed in such a way that in the\nfirst second of each trial, the subjects initiated the rhythmic\nmovement by adopting the correct 2 Hz pace from the visual\ncues and then continued tapping with the acquired rhythm.\nMovement initiation may cause EEG activities coming from\nbilateral or lateralized areas of the brain other than the con-\ntralateral sensorimotor cortex which can result in slight degra-\ndation in the BCI classification performance. Particularly, these\n5Fig. 4. Averaged pre-processed EEGs during repetitive left finger movement\nfor Subject I. Topographical maps have been depicted in consecutive 0.25 s\ntime windows. The top-left map illustrates the averaged EEGs over 0 and\n0.25 seconds time window and the bottom right ones present those of the last\n0.25 seconds window, i.e 5.75 to 6 seconds. Notice the rapid development of\nthe lateralized 2 Hz signal on the contralateral right hemisphere.\nactivities may be attributed to potentials generated by frontal\nstructures including pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA)\nand dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), engaged during finger se-\nlection, movement initiation, and synchronizing to the external\ncue [24]. In addition, in order to tap in synchrony with the\nvisual stimuli, attending to the visual cues inevitably causes\nVEPs to be produced by posterior visual areas. Therefore, one\nwould expect that poor classification performance would be\nachieved during the selection and initiation phases in each\ntrial. The performance should eventually increase after the first\nsecond.\nIn order to investigate how much EEG data should be\nrecorded after the trial onset to have a reliable BCI output,\nwe considered the eight first time intervals, i.e. 0-0.5 s, 0-\n1 s, 0-1.5 s, 0-2 s, 0-2.5 s, 0-3 s, 0-3.5 s, and 0-4 s. For\nclassification, the 45 electrode signals over the sensorimotor\ncortex area depicted in Fig. 5 were considered. The feature\nvector consisted of the (logarithms of the) signal powers at 2\nHz in two conditions: with and without the CSD transform. In\norder to reduce the dimension of the classifier input space, we\nused PCA transform and introduced the first three principal\ncomponents of the feature vectors to the FLD classifier. The\nclassifier was trained on a randomly selected 60% of the\nresulting reduced feature vectors and tested with the remaining\n40%. This cross validation procedure was repeated 400 times.\nThe averaged classification results and their corresponding\nstandard deviations are detailed in Tables I and II.\nNote that the first two time intervals, 0-0.5 s and 0-1 s,\nmay be too short to include enough cycles of the 2 Hz rhythm\nto allow reliable BCI results. However, they can provide an\nindication of the performance lower bound. The classifier per-\nformance eventually increases in later intervals. Tables I and II\nreport that the implementation of the CSD transform increased\nthe CCR for subjects II, IV, and V. However it did not enhance\nthe performance for subjects I and III. Interestingly, for these\ntwo subjects the classification results were in an acceptable\nrange in the very early time windows, indicating that following\nFig. 5. Averaged pre-processed EEGs during repetitive right finger movement\nfor subject I. Topographical maps have been depicted in consecutive 0.25 s\ntime windows. The top-left map illustrates the averaged EEGs over 0 and\n0.25 seconds time window and the bottom right ones present those of the last\n0.25 seconds window, i.e 5.75 to 6 seconds. Notice the rapid development of\nthe lateralized 2 Hz signal on the contralateral left hemisphere.\ninitiation, synchronization stabilized very fast. This might be\ndue to their previous musical training. All subjects had a short\ntraining block before the actual recording, nevertheless, they\nreported afterwards that they had to attend to the pace or the\nonset of each trial. As expected, Tables I and II report that\nhigher classification results can be achieved if the log-energies\nof the EEGs are fed to the classifier.\nC. Classification through the Trial\nAfter the initiation and the synchronization phases, subjects\ncan keep tapping at almost the exact correct pace. Hence,\none could predict that classification based on steady tapping,\nafter the initiation, would be highly reliable. In order to test\nthis finding in the BCI context, we classified the log-energy\nfeatures of bandpass filtered EEGs in multiple overlapping\ntime windows. Particularly, the discrimination accuracy was\ncompared for three di\u000berent sliding time window (TW) du-\nrations, i.e. L = 1 s, L = 2 s, and L = 3 s and the sliding\nstep was set to 0:125 s. Therefore, for L = 1 the TWs were\n0 \u0000 1 s, 0:125 \u0000 1:125 s, \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 , and 5 \u0000 6 s, for L = 2 they were\nas 0 \u0000 2 s, 0:125 \u0000 2:25 s, \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 , and 4 \u0000 6 s, and likewise for\nL = 3, the windows 0 \u0000 3 s, 0:125 \u0000 3:125 s, \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 , and 3 \u0000 6\ns were considered. Moreover, the ITR [bpm] as the second\nmeasure of performance was computed for each time window\nsize according to [13] as\nITR [bpm] =\n\"\nlog2 N + P log2 P + (1 \u0000 P) log2\n1 \u0000 P\nN \u0000 1\n#\n\u0002 60\nL\n(2)\nwhere N = 2 is the number of classes, P is the probability\nof correct classification, and L is the length of the window in\nseconds.\nThe same 45 electrode signals over the sensorimotor cortex\narea were considered. For each window size, we randomly\nselected 60% of the computed log-energy feature vectors\nfor FLD training and the remaining 40% of the feature\nvectors were used for FLD testing. The random selection\n6TABLE I\nAveraged CCRs and their corresponding standard deviations in [%] during movement initiation; without CSD.\nInterval vs. Subject I II III IV V\nFeature !

We\nexperimentally concluded that the first three principal com-\nponents of the feature space yields acceptable CCRs for\nour dataset. Evidently, more advanced pattern classification\nand dimensionality reduction techniques can be utilized for\nperformance optimization which fall outside the scope of this\npaper. Tables III and IV summarize the achieved performances.\nFor each time window size and for each subject, the minimum\nand maximum computed CCRs and ITRs are also reported.\nAs expected, in both Tables III and IV for all five subjects,\nthe averaged CCRs increase when larger time windows are\nconsidered. On the other hand, the ITR is inherently influenced\nby the decision-speed, that is the length of the time window\nL; the averaged ITRs decrease when L increases. Therefore as\nfor any other BCI mechanism, in ssMRP-based BCI there is a\ntradeo\u000b between the feature extraction-classification window\nsize and the BCI speed. The utilization of the CSD transform\nand the logarithm of energy as feature resulted in apparent\nhigher averaged CCRs in Table IV compared to Table III.\nD.

This approach attenuates the VEPs considerably.\nIn Section IV-B, we mentioned that the subjects of the first\nexperiment reported that they had to attend the visual cues\nat the beginning of each trial which could lead to VEPs that\nlowered the classification performance in the first second of\neach trial, Table I and Table II.\nIn order to verify the correspondence between the at-\ntenuation of the VEPs and gradually improving CCRs, we\nmonitored VEPs during the first two seconds of each trial\n(Fig. 4). In that two seconds period, four visual stimuli were\npresented to the subject and each was followed by a VEP\nafter approximately 170 ms. Fig. ?? depicts the averaged VEPs\nacross the period for electrode PO7, PO8, C3, and C4. The\ncorresponding full scale topographical distributions at times\n0.42 s, 0.92 s, 1.42 s, and 1.92 s are plotted in Fig. ??\nto Fig. ??. Importantly, note the large amplitude of the first\nVEP and the attenuation of the following VEPs at PO8. This\nrapid attenuation would greatly reduce VEP contamination of\nssMRPs after the first second. Moreover, either in the absence\nof or during a motor act the VEPs are largely confined to\nthe visual cortex (Fig. ?? to Fig. ??). Therefore for BCI,\nVEP contamination of ssMRPs recorded from the motor cortex\nshould be limited to only the beginning of each trial.\nE. Imagination of rhythmic tapping for BCI\nCortical signals produced during overt or covert movements\npresent similar spatio-temporal patterns as the motor cortex\nbehaves in similar ways during both. In [32], it was shown that\nrhythmic imagination of left and right finger movements with\nfrequencies greater than 1 Hz modulates cortical potentials and\nleads to ssMRPs. However in rhythmic motor imagination, it\nis not possible to objectively verify whether the subject could\nsuccessfully maintain the correct pace. Osman et al. in [32]\nshowed that high frequency rhythmic motor imagination can\nbe carried out after extensive subject training in real rhythmic\nmotor actions.\nWe tested whether classification of ssMRPs recorded during\nrhythmic finger movement imagination is feasible for BCI\napplications. Hence, in the second experiment the subject\nwas instructed to repetitively imagine left or right finger\nTABLE V\nAveraged CCRs, their corresponding standard deviations in [%], and\naveraged ITRs in (bpm) for the second dataset\nPeriod Motor Imagery Without Cue\nTW CCR ITR CCR ITR\nMin 83:47 \u0006 7:2 21.1 63:16 \u0006 6:1 3.0\n1 s Avg 90:21 \u0006 3:2 32.2 81:36 \u0006 7:1 9.1\nMax 91:56 \u0006 0:9 34.9 95:92 \u0006 2:6 45.2\nMin 92:78 \u0006 1:1 18.7 72:38 \u0006 5:0 4.5\n2 s Avg 93:49 \u0006 0:4 19.5 84:79 \u0006 8:7 23.1\nMax 95:12 \u0006 0:4 21.5 98:44 \u0006 2:9 26.5\nmovements after the early fixation period and adopting the\ncorrect pace after fixation at the beginning of each trial, see\nFig. 4. The same classification procedure using two time\nwindows of lengths 1 s and 2 s was carried out. The averaged\nCCRs, their corresponding standard deviations, and the ITRs\nare shown in Table V. The relatively high classification rates of\nabout 90:2% and 93:4%, respectively when the time window\nwas 1 s or 2 s, demonstrate the applicability of the ssMRPs for\nmotor imagery- based BCI. Note that as in Section IV-C, using\na wider time window enhances the classification performance,\nbut reduces the ITR.\nF. Extension to BCI without Visual Cue\nAll established BCI approaches require external visual or\naudio cues to certain levels. For instance the ssVEP- or P300-\nbased BCI would not be possible without the visual stimuli.\nHowever, the ssMRPs can be generated without the visual cues\nafter the subjects adopt the correct pace. As shown in Fig. 4, in\nthe fourth part of each trial the subject started to rhythmically\ntap but without the rhythmic visual cue. Then, the subject was\nasked to continue tapping in the fifth period for another 2\nseconds when the cues appeared.\nThe participant\u2019s success at tapping with the correct rhythm\nis reflected in Fig.7 which displays the time between suc-\ncessive taps (inter-tap intervals). The fourth and the fifth\nperiods included respectively 6 and 4 taps and hence 5 and\n3 intervals. Fig. 7 reports that the subject maintained a pace\nof approximately 2.2 Hz. Moreover, these results match our\n80 0.25 0.42 0.75 0.92 1.25 1.42 1.75 1.92\n\u221215\n\u221210\n\u22125\n0\n5\nTime (s)\n\u00b5\nV\nVisual Evoked Potentials \n \n \nPO7\nPO8\nC3\nC4\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)\nFig. 6.

Note the change in amplitude scaling of the topographic maps in (b)-(e).\nearlier findings that once a fast rhythmic action is started it\ncan be carried out almost automatically [24].\nAs before, two di\u000berent time windows of 1 s and 2 s\nwere considered and the pattern classification procedure was\nimplemented; the results are reported in Table V. Note that,\nthe averaged CCRs during the \u201cTapping Without Cue\u201d are\nrelatively lower than that of \u201cMotor Imagery\u201d. This can\nbe explained as transition from motor imagination to real\nmovement could activate brain areas other than sensorimotor\ncortex and consequently a transient drop in the CCRs. Another\npotential cause could be the replacement of the central fixation\ncross with an \u201cX\u201d for about 100 milliseconds which elicits a\nVEP. As we utilize no spatial filtering to attenuate the e\u000bect\nof this VEP, deterioration of the CCRs are inevitable.\nV. Conclusions\nThe present study used the ssMRPs to provide a measure\nof sensorimotor cortex activation during rhythmic tapping and\nsuggested a potential application for a real-time high accuracy\nBCI. In this approach the subjects were asked to cyclically\nmove their left or right index fingers at a pre-determined fre-\nquency. Therefore, the lateralized and band limited ssMRP was\ndetected from the sensorimotor cortex. The main advantage\nof the ssMRP-based BCI over other approaches is its simple\nrecording setup and straightforward computations. Comparing\nto BCI machines based on RPs, using the ssMRP for BCI\nwould not be di\u000ecult for the subjects since in each trial they\nare actively involved in the experiment, rather than waiting\nfor several seconds before the exertion of a single discrete\nmovement.\nHere, the ssMRP-based BCI has been tested for six healthy\nsubjects. However, its physiological background and simplicity\nof the recording setup support the repeatability of the exper-\niments. In the first experiment, the maximum performance\nwas attained for data windows lying in the middle of each\ntrial, at approximately 3-4 seconds after the movement onset\nin each trial for all participants. For most subjects reliable\nclassification rates could be achieved with shorter data lengthes\n0\n400\n425\n450\n475\n500\nIn\nte\nr\u2212\nTa\np \nIn\net\nrv\nal\n (m\ns)\nWithout Visual Cue With Visual Cue\nFig. 7. Distribution of inter-tap intervals (time between successive taps)\nwithout and with the visual cues. Error bars show the standard deviations.\nand the average CCR for a data window of only 2 s with (or\nwithout) the CSD transform was 94.6% (or 91.2%).\nThe use of CSD transform and the log-energy features in-\ncreased the performance. However, in order to test whether that\nincrease is statistically significant more subjects are needed.\nOn the other hand, real-time implementation of such non-linear\ntransformation is not trivial. A simpler approach would be to\nincorporate the Laplacian derivative of EEGs at each electrode\nsite which is the second derivative of the spline function at that\nlocation. Similar to the CSD transform, it is related to the rate\nof change over space and amplifies the contribution of nearby\nelectrical sources and diminishes that of distant ones.\nWe argue that the ssMRP-based BCI is simpler than the\nssVEP-based BCI systems in terms of subject training time\nand signal analysis. In the proposed method, advanced spectral\nestimation algorithms are not necessary since instead of fre-\nquency separation of ssVEP, only one frequency is dealt with.\nIn other words, instead of exploiting the spectral disparity\nin the signal processing unit of the BCI machine, the topo-\ngraphical distribution of scalp EEG signals in the frequency\nband of interest is used to identify the e\u000bector. The ssMRP\napproach for BCI can be extended beyond the present example\nin a number of ways. To begin with, it should be possible to\nrealize all the ssVEP-based applications by the ssMRPs where\n9a continuous BCI signal rather than a chain of discrete outputs\nis needed; a prime example is robot or wheelchair navigation.\nSecond, the large number of electrodes utilized in this research\nshould not generally be regarded as a hindrance towards end-\nproduct BCI and acceptable performance can be expected from\nfewer electrodes situated over the two motor cortices (Fig. 5).\nThere is subtle di\u000berence here between our interpretation\nof the ssMRPs and that of Gerlo\u000b et al. in [21] where each\ntap was treated individually for exploring EEG correlates of\nsensorimotor activity around the tap onset. However, in our\nwork we treat taps in a short train, i.e. in windows of one,\ntwo, or three seconds, and search for their EEG signatures.\nOn the other hand, a challenging research question would be\nthe classification of ssMRPs but on the classic tap-by-tap basis\nwhich e\u000bectively follows [8] and [12]. In [21] it was shown\nthat the averaged tap-by-tap segmented ssMRPs show distinct\npre-movement motor and post-movement sensory components.\nFor the pre-movement component, one would expect to iden-\ntify a radial dipole source in the primary motor cortex con-\ntralateral to the side of the movement followed by a tangential\npost-movement source located in the primary sensory cortex\nslightly inferior to the former source. These two sources would\nreflect the repetitive e\u000berent and re-a\u000berent motor outputs\nand sensory inputs. Therefore, capturing such a pre-movement\nEEG negative signatures of centro-parietal activity followed\nby a complex of \u201cfrontal negative\u201d-\u201cparietal positive\u201d EEG\ndistribution can significantly enhance the performance of the\nssMRP-based BCI if it can be realized for the single trial data.\nNote that there are also certain di\u000berences between our\nrecording setup and those of previous studies such as [8]\nand [12] where the participants could alternate between right\nand left fingers in consecutive short intervals. That is, the\nsubject could decide whether to move the left or right index on\neach tap. In [8] and [12], the participants were not provided\nwith rhythmic visual cues and therefore a series of discrete\nmovements were carried out rather than rhythmic continuous\nmovements. Therefore, as discussed in Section II, the lower\nclassification performances they obtained might be due to the\nrepetitive activation of the frontal cortex during the initiation\nof each discrete movement. In [8] the actual number of\ntaps per hand and the inter-hand transition matrix had to be\ncomputed objectively and shown on the screen; the taps on\nthe keyboard were extracted as markers into the stream of\nEEG measurements. Therefore, if the tap rate or the number\nof alterations deviated from pre-instructed rate, the subject\nwas informed so those could be compensated accordingly. In\nsuch a scenario, one could not expect steady state MRPs to\nbe generated. Finally, In specific applications, such as typing\non the keyboard, the BCI system should ideally be able to\ndistinguish between left and right finger movements in each\nindividual discrete tap. However, there are other applications\nsuch as navigating a wheelchair, in which a smooth and\ncontinuous BCI output is demanded. We believe that with\nfurther refinements our protocol will lead to a reliable and\nrobust BCI.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Benjamin\nBlankertz at Berlin BCI for his comments on EEG recording\nprotocol used in [8] and [12].\nReferences\n[1] M.
