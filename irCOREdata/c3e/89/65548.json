A review of the \nexisting literature finds both pessimistic and optimistic accounts of the impact of \nhomeworking on employee attitudes and behaviors.  Drawing on a survey of 749 managerial \nand professional employees in knowledge intensive industries, the study finds more support \nfor the optimistic perspective. The findings suggest that homeworking is positively \nassociated with employee wellbeing and a more balanced work-home relationship.  There is \nno evidence that organizational citizenship behaviours are reduced by homeworking but \nthere is some support for homeworking undermining employees\u2019 perception of the \norganization as supporting their careers and personal development. \n. \n \nKey words: spatial flexibility, homeworkers, wellbeing, work-life balance, organizational \ncitizenship behaviour, knowledge workers \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nMany futurists\u201f visions of work predict a functionally flexible, transitory and portable \nworkforce, especially for those employed in the knowledge-based industries (e.g.  Knell, \n2000). The debate suggests that organizations need to be more agile and nimble in order to \nsurvive in hyper-competitive and global markets, so that flexibility has become something of \nan organizational panacea, facilitating firms\u201f rapid adaptation to market conditions in highly \ncompetitive and rapidly changing environments. Organizational flexibility is often seen as an \neffective solution to many managerial problems, from cost control to coping with skill \nshortages. Paralleling managerial interest, research on organizational flexibility has grown \nrapidly of late. There are now large literatures on labour flexibility, especially on the three \ncategories identified by Atkinson\u201fs (1984) model of the flexible firm namely, numerical, \nfunctional and pay flexibility. In this study we are concerned with a rather neglected aspect of \nthe labour flexibility debate, homeworking in the new knowledge based economy.  \n \n 3 \nThe study of homeworking has a long history in many traditional sectors and studies have \nexamined the work and family lives of homeworkers at all levels in the organization from the \nhighly skilled free-lance professional to the outsourced pieceworker. There is a growing \nliterature on the impact of employers\u201f use of flexibility on employee attitudes and behaviours. \nThere is research on, for example, numerical flexibility through temporary staffing, and the \nuse of agency staff, interims, and sub-contractors (Benson, 1998; Moorman and Harland, \n2002; Liden et al 2003); functional flexibility (Berg and Velde, 2005; Cordery et al 1993); \nand pay flexibility (Tremblay, Sire and Pelchat, 2004). However, we can locate no equivalent \nstudies which systematically compare the work attitudes of home- and office-based workers. \nAlthough the study of alternative location working and especially homeworking is well \ndeveloped, the dominant methods of inquiry into the working lives of homeworkers has been \nvia the secondary analysis of large data sets and through in-depth qualitative studies, usually \ninterview based, rather than through survey-based research designs. \n \nThus, using data sets such as the Labour Force Survey (Felstead et al, 2001) and WERS \n(Felstead et al, 2002), we have analyses of the growth of alternative location working, the \ntypes of occupation and industries such working occurs in, and the types of individual \ninvolved in working from home and office. Equally, from the richly detailed work of \nqualitative researchers (Tietze and Musson, 2006; Halford 2005; Beach, 1989), we have a \nbalanced insight into the pitfalls and problems of homeworking in comparison to the rather \nrosy picture constructed by past research. However, such studies have left an important gap in \nour knowledge of the impact of spatial location on employee wellbeing, work-life balance \nand outcomes such as willingness to engage in extra role behaviours, intent to quit and \nabsenteeism. In this paper, we draw on a survey of managerial and professional employees in \n 4 \nknowledge based industries to address these research gaps.  Our key contribution is to \nevaluate the impact of home- versus office-based working on employee work attitudes and \nbehaviours. We seek to answer the following question: does the location of work (office or \nhome) really matter to knowledge workers? \n \nLiterature and hypotheses \n \nThe benefits of flexibility for organizational performance are now generally well established \n(Hatum and Pettigrew, 2006; Desombre et al 2006). However, we know less about the impact \nof organizational flexibility on those who are required to be the most flexible; the worker. In \ngeneral two broad, and very different, accounts can be found on the future of work for the \nflexible worker. First, a rather pessimistic account of the flexible worker portrays the work \nexperience as one where individuals are part of a \u201cdegraded\u201d workforce. Labour historians\u201f \naccounts of homeworking and \u201cputting out\u201d work systems have often condemned \nhomeworking as an essentially exploitative process (Boris, 1994).  Homeworkers in manual \noccupations are disproportionately made up from women and ethnic minority workers, who \nmay be especially vulnerable to exploitation (Felstead and Jewson, 2000). Recent studies of \nhomeworkers have emphasized the continuing potential for exploitation, reporting examples \nof disadvantaged work groups with low pay, high levels of job insecurity and poor benefits \n(Phizacklea and Wolkowitz, 1995; Heyes and Gray, 2001; Jurik, 1998). Homeworker \nexploitation has continued despite coordinated approaches involving codes of practice, \nethical trading initiatives, anti-sweat shop campaigns, campaigns for legislative protection \nand organizing drives by unions and NGO\u201fs such as the National Group on Homeworking \n(Williams, 2005). \n 5 \n \nSecond, a more optimistic view sees the emergence of a new type of homeworker; the \nflexible knowledge worker. Such individuals are seen as highly valued \u201cfree workers\u201d \n(Donnelly, 2006; Knell, 2000), who are independent, empowered and posses high-levels of \nself-generated human and social capital, and who can determine their own working \narrangements. Many observers have welcomed the growth of homeworking as a potentially \nliberating structure for workers, as a means of breaking away from oppressive employment \npractices. There are several upbeat accounts of the new professional homeworker (Berke, \n2003). According to Hardhill, popular writing on technology-enabled homeworking stresses \n\u201cthe freedom, flexibility and new opportunities it gives\u201d (2003:156). In these accounts, \nhomeworking is viewed as a family-friendly work practice that results in better work-life \nbalance, an ability to combine child rearing and career development, reduced stress levels, \nand reduced levels of conflict between work and home (Huws, 1993). In addition, absence \nand quit rates are argued to be much reduced by homeworking, as the demands of work and \nhome are more easily accommodated due to the greater flexibility provided (Frolick et al, \n1993; Bricknell, 1996). \n \nSystematic evaluation of the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives as they apply to the \nspatially flexible new knowledge worker are few and far between. There is large-scale panel \ndata evidence on \u201catypical\u201d flexible workers, suggesting that such employees do not have \nreduced levels of wellbeing (measured in terms of health and life and job satisfaction) when \ncompared to traditionally employed workers (Bardasi and Francesconi, 2003).  However, this \nstudy only examined flexibility in terms of part-time versus full-time and temporary versus \npermanent contract work patterns, rather than considering work location.  \n 6 \n \nFelstead et al\u201fs (2002) analysis of the employee data from WERS 98 examined the attitudes \nof those \u201centitled\u201d to work at home compared to those \u201cdenied\u201d the opportunity to work from \nhome. For non-manual employees the \u201centitleds\u201d had significantly higher levels of job \ninfluence, positive perceptions of the workplace climate, organizational commitment, and job \nsatisfaction but also reported higher levels of work intensification. However, the concern here \nis that we may not be picking up a location effect as such, but rather an empowerment \nimpact, as it is not clear how many of the entitleds actually did work from home. In fact, the \nevidence suggests that few of those entitled to work at home for part of their working week \ntake advantage of the opportunity (Perlow, 1997; Hochschild, 1997).  \n \nExplanations for this lack of take up of homeworking have centred on the need to be present \nat work for individual performance evaluations in \u201cface time\u201d work cultures (Bailyn, 1993). \nFace time work cultures are defined by Kossek (2003) as where time spent at work is seen as \na signal of an individual's level of productivity and organizational commitment.  Hoschschild \n(1997) offers a different explanation for this lack of take up, arguing that workers are voting \nwith their feet \u2013 and the workplace wins.  The modern organizational culture for professional \nworkers is argued to be a large pull factor as its makes such workers feel valued and \nappreciated.  In contrast, home life with its struggles for space, interruptions, noise and \ndomestic squabbles has been seen as \u201cnothing short of a torment\u201d (Coverdill, 2000: 234).  \n \nIn assessing this rather limited evidence on the impact of work location on employee attitudes \nand behaviors, it is clear that there are both disadvantages and advantages for the individual \nemployee in homeworking. Daniels et al (2001: 1152) hypothesize a range of individual costs \n 7 \nand benefits associated with increased teleworking.  The main costs for employees include \nfewer chances for promotion and training\/development, more routine work, increased conflict \nbetween work and home, limited face to face contact with colleagues, increased social \nisolation, reduced job security and more time spent working.  The benefits of teleworking for \nthe individual are suggested to be more time for home and family, greater job autonomy, less \ncommuting and stress, and more flexible work hours.  \n \nIn sum, it seems that the consequences of increased homeworking on employees are most \nevident in four areas; employee wellbeing; career progression and opportunities for training \nand development; family-friendly working; and levels of employee work effort and absence. \nAmongst managerial and professional employees in the knowledge intensive industries, we \nmay expect findings to be in line with the more optimistic conceptualization of the impact of \nalternative work location, that in general homeworking will be associated with higher levels \nof employee wellbeing. We conceptualize employee wellbeing broadly as involving job and \nlife satisfaction, feelings of empowerment and organizational commitment, and having a \npositive mood state and low levels of stress, emotional burnout, absenteeism, and \norganizational withdrawal cognitions.  \n \nBased on these arguments, we hypothesize as follows: \n \nHypothesis 1: After controlling for total hours worked, there will be a positive association \nbetween the level of hours worked at home and: a). job satisfaction, b). life satisfaction, c). \npsychological empowerment, d). organizational commitment). positive affect, and a negative \n 8 \nassociation with f). organizational withdrawal cognitions, g). absenteeism h). stress and i). \nemotional burnout. \n \nThe exception to this positive impact on employee wellbeing is that homeworking appears be \nassociated with reduced career and training and developments opportunities. Here the strong \nlinking of career and developmental opportunities to informal and closed discussions in the \nworkplace (e.g. Harris and Brewster, 1999) is argued to favour the office based-worker over \nthe homeworker.  \n \nHypothesis 2: After controlling for total hours worked, there will be a negative association \nbetween the level of hours worked at home and employee\u201fs perceptions of organizational \nsupport for careers and training and development. \n \nThe nature of the relationship between work and family life has been one of the most widely \ndebated topics in management over the last decade or so. A general consensus has emerged in \nthe literature that work-life balance is improved by homeworking (Baines and Gelder, 2003; \nFelstead, Jewson, Phizacklea, and Walters, 2002; Sullivan and Lewis, 2001; Beach, 1989). \nThe general argument is that not only does homeworking provide the homeworker with the \nadvantages deriving from greater  control and flexibility in relation to  the pace and timing of \nwork but that it insulates them from a range of stresses emerging from office based working  \nsuch as long hours spent commuting and competitive peer pressure in the workplace (Green, \n2001).  \n \n 9 \nHypothesis 3: After controlling for total hours worked, there will be a positive association \nbetween the level of hours worked at home and a). employee\u201fs perceptions of family \nsupportive organizational practices and a negative association with b). family-to-work and c). \nwork-to-family conflict. \n \nWe also examine the relationship between alternative location working hours and \norganizational citizenship behaviour (OCB).  Organizational citizenship behaviour is strongly \nassociated with organizational performance across a wide range of measures (Podsakoff and \nMacKenzie, 1997). Some organizational citizenship behaviors are targeted at helping the \norganization, so-called OCB-Organizational (OCB-O). These include highly cooperative \nbehaviors which help increase efficiency and productivity, such as volunteering for things \nthat are not absolutely required by the job and making innovative suggestions to improve \nquality or reduce waste (Organ, Podsakoff, and Mackenzie, 2006). Such behaviors go beyond \nbasic compliance with job requirements, to include discretionary behaviors which reflect a \nhighly cooperative adherence to the spirit as well as the letter of organizational requirements. \nAnother category of OCB\u201fs involve helping specific individuals within the organization, \nusually co-workers. Labelled as OCB-Individual (OCB-I), such behaviours include helping \nnew co-workers settle into the job.  \n \nWe can find no studies that have examined the citizenship behaviours of alternative location \nworkers, but drawing from contact theory as a predictive explanation of behavior at work \n(Gutek, Cohen and Konrad, 1990), the suggestion is that physical proximity and frequent \ncontact with the organization are necessary to develop the underpinning attachment needed to \nengage in citizenship behaviours directed at helping the organization. There is some evidence \n 10 \nfrom research on \u201chot desking\u201d \u2013 where employees are not assigned dedicated workspaces, \nbut work from any desk that happens to be vacant \u2013 that physical location has significant \nimplications on the way in which employees engage with the organization (Millward, Haslam \nand Postmes, 2007).  Employees with assigned desks had higher levels of organizational and \nteam identification than those without a desk.  This argument suggests that the more distal \nhomeworking will be less strongly associated with OCB behaviors, such that those who \nspend a higher proportion of their time working at home may actually show lower levels of \nOCB-O than their colleagues who work mainly from the office. An additional argument, over \nand above the differing motivational bases for OCB of home and office based workers, does \nnot depend on the logic that homeworkers are unwilling or less motivated to perform these \nextra role behaviours, but that their physical separation from the organization and from their \nco-workers reduces their opportunity to engage in such extra-role behaviors, either OCB-O or \nOCB-I.  Thus, we hypothesize as follows: \n \nHypothesis 4: After controlling for total hours worked, there will be a negative association \nbetween the level of hours worked at home and organizational citizenship behavior. \n \nMethod \n \nSample. Alternative location working is most common in managerial and professional \noccupations and in knowledge intensive industries (Felstead et al, 2002).  Thus a self-\ncompletion web-based questionnaire was administered to an appropriate sample of \nmanagerial and professional employees in knowledge intensive organizations during July \n2006. The sample was drawn from the client list of a UK management consultancy firm \n 11 \nspecializing in the knowledge intensive sector.  A total of 918 responses were received by the \ncut off date, and following deletion of cases with missing values, 749 were usable.   The \nmedian age of respondents was 30-39; the median organizational tenure was 3-4 years and \njob tenure 1-2 years. Thirty-eight percent of respondents were female, with sixty-six percent \nmarried or living as married.  Twelve percent of the sample were board level managers, 26 \npercent were senior managers, 26 percent were middle managers, 13 percent first-line \nmanagers and 18 percent professionals and 3 percent others.  \n \nMeasures.  Unless stated otherwise, responses were on a seven-point scale, from \u201cstrongly \ndisagree\u201d (1) to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d (7). Where other response scales were used this was done to \nbe consistent with previous research.  \n \nJob satisfaction was measured with three items from the Michigan Organizational \nAssessment Questionnaire (as reported in Spector, 1997), for example: \u201cGenerally speaking, I \nam very satisfied with this job\u201d. Life satisfaction was measured with three items from Neal, \nSirgy and Uysal (1999), for example: \u201eI am generally happy with my life\u201f. We added a fourth \nitem: \u201eAll in all, I am satisfied with my life as a whole\u201f. Organizational commitment was \nmeasured with Meyer and Allen\u201fs (1997) six-item affective commitment scale, for example: \n\u201cI really feel as if this organization\u201fs problems are my own.\u201d  Withdrawal cognitions were \nmeasured with three items, for example: \u201cI often think of quitting this job.\u201d  Absence was \nmeasured with a single item   \u201cHow many days have you been absent from work (not \nincluding holidays) over the last 12 months?\u201d (0-2 days, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-24, 24 or \nmore) scored 1-7. \n \n 12 \nBurnout was measured with nine items taken from Maslach and Jackson\u201fs (1981) emotional \nexhaustion scale with a sample item being \u201cI feel emotionally drained from my work.\u201d   \nRespondents were asked \u201cThink about how you feel about your work.  How often do you feel \neach of the following? anchored 1= never and 7 = every day. Overall job stress was measure \nwith a four-item scale from Spreitzer et al (1997) with a sample item being \u201cMy job is \nextremely stressful\u201d.  Empowerment was measured using Spreitzer's (1995, 1996) 12-item \npsychological empowerment scale. The four sub-scales, meaning, competence, self-\ndetermination and impact, were added to provide an overall empowerment construct, as is \ncommonly done in the literature (e.g., Spreitzer, 1995, 1996). Items included: \u201cThe work I do \nis very important to me\u201d (meaning), \u201cI am confident about my ability to do my job\u201d \n(competence), \u201cI have significant autonomy in determining how I do my job\u201d (self-\ndetermination), and \u201cMy impact on what happens in my department is large\u201d (impact). \nPositive affectivity was measured with three items from Agho et al., (1992), for example: \u201cI \nlive a very interesting life.\u201d Perception of organizational support for careers and training \nand development was measured with a 4 item sub-scale from Gould-Williams (2005) with \nsample items being \u201cI am provided with sufficient opportunities for training and \ndevelopment\u201d and \u201cI have the opportunities I want to be promoted\u201d.  \n \nPerceptions of family supportive organizational practices were measured with six high \nloading items drawn from Allen (2001), with a sample item being \u201cIt is assumed the most \nproductive employees are those who put their work before their family life\u201d (reverse scored). \nFamily-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict were measured with two five item scales \nfrom (Netmeyer et al, 1996) with sample items, respectively, \u201cThe demands of my family \ninterfere with work-related activities\u201d; \u201cThe amount of time my job takes up makes it \n 13 \ndifficult to fulfill family responsibilities\u201d. Organizational citizenship behavior-organization \n(OCB-O) was measured with five items drawn from the compliance dimension of Smith, \nOrgan and Near (1983) representing behaviours targeted at the organization (e.g., \u201cVolunteer \nfor things that are not absolutely required\u201d). Organizational citizenship behavior-individual \n(OCB-I), representing behaviours targeted at individuals, was measured with items (e.g. \n\u201cHelp new people settle into the job\u201d, \u201cHelp others who have heavy workloads\u201d) based on the \naltruism dimension of Smith, Organ and Near (1983). Responses for both OCB-O and OCB-I \nwere on a five-point scale, reflecting the frequency of engagement in the activity (\u201cnever\u201d to \n\u201calways\u201d). Hours worked at home was measured by asking respondents to report the number \nof hours worked at home in a typical work week in the ranges: under 5, 5-9,10-14,15-19, 20-\n24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, over 60 hours scored 1 to 13.  \n \nWe included the following control variables in our analyses: age ( under 20, 20-29, 30-39, \n40-49, 50-59, 60-65, over 65) scored 1 to 7, gender (female = 1; male = 0) and marital status \n(married = 1; single\/divorced\/other = 0), and total weekly hours worked in a typical work \nweek (under 10, 10-14,15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, over \n60 hours) scored 1 to 12.  \n \nResults \n \nMean, standard deviations, correlations and alphas for the study variables are reported in \ntable 1. All the multi-item scales had alphas greater than .7 with the exception of positive \naffect (.58), stress (.56) and OCB-O (.69) which were slightly below.   \n \n 14 \nInsert table 1 near here \n \nThe regression analyses are shown in table 2.  Of the control variables, age was positively \nassociated with job satisfaction, life satisfaction, psychological empowerment, perceptions of \nfamily friendly work organization, affective commitment and positive affect, and negatively \nassociated with burnout, stress, work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict and \nwithdrawal cognitions.  Gender and marital status were in general less important, with gender \npositively associated with job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, OCB-I and \npositive effect and negatively associated family-to-work conflict, OCB-O and withdrawal \ncognitions.  Marital status was negatively associated with positive affect and positively \nassociated with OCB-O. Total hours worked was positively associated with affective \ncommitment, psychological empowerment, burnout, stress, work-to-family conflict, family-\nto-work conflict OCB and OCB-I, and negatively associated with life satisfaction and \nwithdrawal cognitions. Not surprisingly, it seems that longer working hours in total tends to \nundermine employee wellbeing.  \n \nInsert table 2 near here \n \n \nHypothesis 1 suggested that after controlling for total hours worked homeworking will be \nassociated with employee wellbeing. The findings in Table 2 show support for hypotheses \n1)a. , 1)b., 1)c. , 1)e., 1)h., and 1)i. with hours worked in the home positively associated with \njob and life satisfaction, psychological empowerment, positive affect and negatively \nassociated with burnout and stress. We found no significant relationships between hours \n 15 \nworked at home and organizational commitment, withdrawal cognitions, and absenteeism \nproviding no support for hypotheses 1)d., 1)e. and 1)g. These findings provide partial support \nfor hypothesis 1, that homeworking is associated with employee wellbeing. \n \nHypothesis 2 examined the relationship between homeworking and an employee\u201fs \nperceptions of the organization as supporting their career aspirations and personal \ndevelopment needs. Our suggestion was that homeworking would be negatively associated \nwith perceived career development opportunities. The hypothesis was supported, with a \nsignificant negative association providing some support for Hypothesis 2.  \n \nHypothesis 3 concerned the impact of work location on employees\u201f work-life balance. We \nexamined the impact of homeworking on employee\u201fs perceptions of their organization as \nfamily friendly and the levels of family-to-work and work-to-family conflict. The findings in \nTable 2 show some support for the positive impact of homeworking hours on work life \nbalance. Hours worked at home were positively associated with perceptions of the \norganization as family friendly, and negatively associated with family-to-work conflict \nproviding support for hypotheses 3)a. and 3)b. There was no such association for work-to-\nfamily conflict, suggesting that working at home provides no help here. It appears that the \ngreater flexibility afforded by working at home helps prevent family responsibilities \ninterfering with work, but that it does not prevent work responsibilities interfering with \nfamily life.    \n \nHypothesis 4 concerned the impact of homeworking on OCB-O and OCB-I.  The findings in \nTable 2 show a positive association between total hours worked and both OCB-O and OCB-I, \n 16 \nbut there was no significant association between homeworking and OCB, providing no \nsupport for hypotheses 4. There is thus no evidence for our suggestion that working at home \nisolates the individual worker to such an extent that OCB declines. \n \n \nDiscussion and conclusions \n \nThere has been a vigorous debate on the impact of new forms of work organization. This has \npolarized somewhat, with the literature falling into optimistic and pessimistic accounts of the \nimpact of increased alternative location working arrangements. Our findings in this study, on \nbalance, provide some qualified support for the more optimistic perspective of homeworking. \nWe find that homeworking hours are positively associated with employee wellbeing, with \nhours worked in the home being positively associated with job and life satisfaction, \npsychological empowerment, and positive affect, and negatively associated with burnout and \nstress.  \n \nHowever, improved wellbeing of homeworkers may come at a price. One of the main \nconcerns of those most pessimistic about homeworking, that it undermines organizations \nwillingness to invest in the training and development of such workers and negatively impacts \non their career progress, found some support in this study. There was a significant negative \nrelationship between hours worked in the home and perceptions of organizational support for \ncareer development and training. It seems, at least for managerial and professional employees \nin knowledge based industries, that homeworking can act as an antidote to the stresses and \nstrains caused by office based working and reduce the negative impact of such work \n 17 \nenvironments on employee wellbeing, but that this may come at the expense of lower levels \nof support for career development. \n \nFamily friendly working cultures and work-life balance have been one of the key topics of \nrecent HRM research. One of the contributions of this paper is to add some new insights to \nthis debate from the perspective of spatial flexibility. From the general pattern of findings of \nthis study the family-friendly workplace appears to be one with more home-based working. \nHours worked at home were positively associated with perceptions of the organization as \nfamily friendly, and negatively associated with family-to-work conflict. However, there was \nno significant association between homeworking and work-to-family conflict. These findings \nsuggest that the greater flexibility afforded by working at home rather than in the office helps \nprevent family responsibilities interfering with work, but that it does not prevent work \nresponsibilities interfering with family life. On reflection, this pattern of findings is perhaps \nnot too surprising, since working at home is hardly associated with a reduced opportunity for \nfamily to interfere with work.  \n \nThere has been a debate in the alternative location working literature on the impact of such \nworking arrangements on work effort and performance. The advocates of telework often \nargue for its introduction using a business case based on improved employee productivity \n(Collins, 2005). We sought to examine this issue by analyzing the impact of homeworking on \norganizational citizenship behaviours targeted at the organization and individuals. We found \nthat total hours worked was positively associated with both OCB-O and OCB-I, but that \nhomeworking hours were not significantly associated with OCB. The effects of homeworking \non OCB appear from our findings to be benign, with no evidence for our suggestion that \n 18 \nOCB would be undermined by homeworking due to lower levels of motivation and \nopportunity for such behaviours.  \n \nAn often-voiced argument for why homeworking is not more widely practiced is that \nemployers are concerned about losing control over the efforts of non-office located staff \n(Felstead, Jewson and Walters, 2003). For example, Tietze and Musson report homeworkers \nas indulging in the practice of \u201cgift-time\u201d by rewarding themselves with time-off work for \nefficient working.  Our findings on OCB are significant in removing a potentially important \nargument against the use of homeworking by business organizations anxious to maximimise \nproductivity and performance. It would also be interesting to examine the relationship \nbetween homeworking and in-role and organizational performance in other work contexts. \nThis is clearly an area that that would merit further research.  \n \nIn conclusion, we suggest there is a need to refine the arguments of Daniel et al (2001) in \nrelation to the costs and benefits of homeworking.  The overall pattern of findings in this \nstudy suggests that there are some costs associated with homeworking for the individual, in \nterms of reduced career development opportunities, but that homeworking is also associated \nwith employee wellbeing along several dimensions. We have been concerned primarily with \nthe association between homeworking and employee attitudes. We suggest that future \nresearch might focus also on the costs and benefits to employers.  \n \nOur findings must be interpreted in light of the limitations of the study. First, our findings \nmay be susceptible to common method bias, since our measures all originated from an \nemployee survey. Second, since the study was cross-sectional we cannot make definitive \n 19 \nconclusions on causation. Longitudinal studies would be very useful in allowing us to say \nmore about issues of causation. Third, our data comes from one country, Britain, from one \ngroup of employees \u2013 managers and professionals, and from knowledge intensive \norganizations. Whether our findings would replicate in other countries, different groups of \nworkers, and in other sectors remains to be seen.  Finally, we suggest that although the study \nhas several limitations, the findings here would seem to suggest that location of work really \ndoes matter for the knowledge worker, and that there may be very real benefits to employees \nin an increase in homeworking, at least for this kind of employee. \n 20 \nReferences \nAgho, A.O., J.L.
