INTRODUCTION\nWaves confined in irregularly shaped geometries of opti-\ncal microresonators (such as micro-optical lasers made of\nsemiconductors [1], microcrystals [2], or laser dye droplets\n[3]) pose practical and theoretical challenges, as an intricate\ninterference pattern arises from the multiple coherent scatter-\ning off the confining boundaries. This is especially true at\nresonant conditions, when the multiple scattering results in\nsystematic constructive interference. The most direct probes\nof these microresonators are scattering experiments: The sys-\ntems are illuminated with a coherent light source, and the\nscattering cross section is detected. The resonant peaks ob-\nserved in the cross section are related to quasibound states\n(found at complex energies or frequencies), which can be\nobserved as the working modes of micro-optical lasers. Ir-\nregular geometries are favored because they offer a rich\nmode structure and permit highly anisotropic modes with\nwell-defined directed emission [4]. The resonance pattern in\nthe total scattering cross section does not reflect this richness\nin the mode structure\u2014according to Breit-Wigner theory, the\nweight and width of a resonance is determined by the life-\ntime of the mode; the wave pattern itself is of no concern [5].\nIn this paper, we show that complemental information about\nthe quasibound states is contained in the directly accessible\noptomechanical response of the system, which actually does\ndistinguish between modes of different degree of anisotropy.\nThe optomechanical probes of the resonances and the as-\nsociated quasibound states that we discuss in this paper are\nthe force and the torque exerted on the dielectric microreso-\nnator by the light pressure of an illuminating beam. We focus\non the practically most useful case of irregular but effec-\ntively two-dimensional geometries, and also allow for a finite\namplification rate. Over the past decade, optomechanical\ntools based on light pressure have found various applications\nin the manipulation of microscopic objects, for which usually\nsimple shapes have been assumed, and precision detection of\nthe acting forces have become commonplace [6]. For in-\nstance, dielectric objects of micrometer dimensions have\nbeen brought into rotation by light pressure, and the acting\ntorque has been determined from the rotation of the object in\na viscous medium [7\u201313]. Typical torques are of the order of\n10\u221217 N m for micrometer-sized objects at 500 nm wave\nlength and 10 mW intensity. These dimensions and operation\nparameters are also typical for optical microresonators and\nmicrolasers. The rotation rate depends on the viscosity of the\nambient medium and is of order of several hertz (typical\nforces are of the order of 10\u2013100 pN). In some of these\nexperiments torques as small as .10\u221219 N m proved to be\nsufficient to induce rotation. The rotation technique can be\nused not only to determine the torque, but also to determine\nthe viscosity once the torque has been obtained by indepen-\ndent (e.g., optical) means [14\u201316]. Microelectromechanical\nsystems [17] have not been applied in this context so far, but\nin principle are also sensitive enough to detect the optom-\nechanical response.\nWe suggest to use the optomechanical response for ana-\nlyzing the internal wave dynamics in complicated geom-\netries. We demonstrate that the mechanical response contains\ninformation which is analogous to the scattering cross sec-\ntion and the delay time (the conventional probes for reso-\nnances), but is sensitive to other, complemental aspects of\nthe quasibound states, such as their degree of anisotropy\n(which is reflected by the torque). Consequentially, the me-\nchanical probes help to distinguish between different wave\npatterns. At finite amplification rate within the medium, they\ncontain information on the far-field emission pattern. Our\ngeneral argumentation is supported in a practical setting by\nnumerical computations for the annularly shaped dielectric\ndisk shown in Fig. 1, which displays a multifaceted set of\nwave patterns due to its non-integrable classical ray dynam-\nics [18,19]. We use two different numerical procedures, the\nwave-matching method (see, e.g., Ref. [19]) and the bound-\nary element method [20].\nPHYSICAL REVIEW A 70, 012703 (2004)\n1050-2947\/2004\/70(1)\/012703(8)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 012703-1\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II, we\nbriefly discuss resonances, quasibound states, and conven-\ntional probes of their detection (the Wigner delay time and\nthe scattering cross section) in the framework of scattering\ntheory. Section III contains the principal results of this paper.\nSection III A provides the kinematical relations for the force\nand torque in terms of the information provided by the scat-\ntering matrix. In Sec. III B we compare the conventional and\nmechanical probes for the annular resonator and show that\nthe anisotropy of the wave pattern is tested by the torque.\nRounding up the considerations, in Sec. III C we discuss\nhow the far-field emission pattern can be inferred by means\nof amplification. Our conclusions are collected in Sec. IV.\nThe Appendix contains details on the derivation of the kine-\nmatical relations.\nII. RESONANCES AND QUASIBOUND STATES\nIN SCATTERING THEORY\nA. Scattering approach\nIn this paper we apply standard scattering theory to the\neffectively two-dimensional systems in question. We sepa-\nrate the two polarizations of the electromagnetic field, with\neither the electric field\nEz = Refexps\u2212 ivtdcg s1d\nor the magnetic field\nBz = c\u22121Refexps\u2212 ivtdcg s2d\npolarized perpendicular to the plane. In both cases, the com-\nplex wave function c fulfills the two-dimensional Helmholtz\nequation\nsD + n2k2dc = 0, s3d\nwhere n is the position-dependent refractive index, k=v \/c is\nthe wave number, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.\nAmplification is modeled by a complex refractive index with\nIm n,0.\nWe choose a circular region A of radius R.R, contain-\ning the resonator, and decompose the wave function in the\nexterior of A in the usual Hankel function basis,\nc = o\nm\nfam\nsindHm\ns2dskrd + am\nsoutdHm\ns1dskrdgeimf, s4d\nwhere r and f are polar coordinates. (Here and in the fol-\nlowing, all sums run from \u2212\u2018 to \u2018.) The angularly resolved\nradiation in the far field is given by\nIsfd =\n2\npuku Uom amsoutdeimsf\u2212p\/2dU2. s5d\nBelow the laser threshold, the expansion coefficients a\nm\nsoutd\nof the outgoing wave are related to their incoming counter-\nparts a\nm\nsind by linear relations\nam\nsoutd\n= o\nm8\nSmm8am8\nsind\n, s6d\nwhere the coefficients Smm8 form the scattering matrix. The\nscattering matrix fulfills the time-reversal symmetry\nSm,n = S\u2212n,\u2212ms\u2212 1dm+n, s7d\nand is unitary for real k and n. For complex values, unitarity\nis replaced by\nS\u22121sk,nd = fSsk * ,n * dg\u2020. s8d\nB. Poles and quasibound states\nQuasibound states are found at complex values kc of k\nthat permit nontrivial solutions asoutd=ac in the case of no\nincident radiation,\nasind = S\u22121asoutd = 0 . s9d\nIt follows that the values kc are the poles of the scattering\nmatrix, which (for real n) all reside in the lower complex\nplane as a consequence of causality.\nFor the annular resonator, complex values kc are shown in\nthe bottom panel of Fig. 2, and some typical wave patterns\nare presented in the right panels of Fig. 3. For this system\nwith a reflection symmetry about the x axis, the quasibound\nstates occur with even and odd parity [21], and further can be\ndivided into whispering-gallery modes localized at the inte-\nrior interface (class Wint) or at the exterior interface (class\nWext), and more extended modes that we group into two\nclasses A (inside the interior circle, these modes are of\nwhispering-gallery character) and C (the remaining modes).\nClose to resonance in the complex k-plane fk\n<k\nc\nsevend\n,k\nc\nsodddg, the scattering matrix can be approximated by\n[22]\nS <\nac\nsevend\n^ a\u02dcc\nsevend\nk \u2212 kc\nsevend +\nac\nsoddd\n^ a\u02dcc\nsoddd\nk \u2212 kc\nsoddd , s10d\nwhere a\u02dcc,m= s\u22121dmac,m due to time-reversal symmetry and we\naccounted for the potentially quasidegenerate partner of op-\nposite parity (indicated by the superscripts).\nFIG. 1. The annular resonator used in the numerical investiga-\ntions of this paper is composed of two circles with radii R and R8\n=0.6 R, and eccentricity d=0.22 R. The refractive index is n=1\noutside the resonator, n=1.8 in the annular region between the\ncircles, and n=3.3 inside the interior circle.\nSCHOMERUS, WIERSIG, AND HENTSCHEL PHYSICAL REVIEW A 70, 012703 (2004)\n012703-2\nIn general, the quasibound states found for complex kc\nand real n can be transported to real values of k.Re kc by\nsetting Im n. Im kc Re n \/Re kc, corresponding to an active,\namplifying medium close to threshold [23]. Above threshold,\npoles formally move into the upper complex plane, which\nphysically indicates instability, and the linear relation be-\ntween asind and asoutd breaks down. Yet, in homogeneously\namplifying media the lasing modes are well approximated by\nthe cold-resonator modes [24\u201326]. The far-field emission\npattern of the laser\nIcsfd =\n2\npuku Uom ac,msoutdeimsf\u2212p\/2dU2, s11d\nis then given by Eq. (5), evaluated with the quasi-bound state\nac that wins the mode competition (the first mode that be-\ncomes unstable).\nC. Resonances and their conventional probes\nThe values kc are the poles of S where this matrix is\nsingular, and are reflected by resonances of the system at real\nvalues k=Re kc. Conventional probes for resonances are ob-\ntained from the total scattering cross section\nFIG. 2. (Color) The top panels show four quantities (in arbitrary\nunits) as a function of k that probe for resonances in the annular\nresonator: The Wigner delay time tW, the angle-of-incidence aver-\naged scattering cross-section s0, the angle-of-incidence averaged\nforce in forward direction F0, and the variance of the torque var N.\nThe lower panel shows the complex resonance wave numbers kc of\nquasibound states, classified by their wave patterns as described in\nthe text: Wint (s), Wext (n), A (h), C (L). Open symbols indicate\nmodes of even parity, full symbols are modes of odd parity. The\ncomplex resonances are also indicated by the spikes in the top pan-\nels, located at k=Re kc with height proportional to the life time\n1\/ s\u22122c Im kcd. Additionally, the resonances of Fig. 3(a)\u20133(e) are\nindicated by the arrows at the very top.\nFIG. 3. (Color) The panels (a\u2013e) show results for various com-\nbinations of k and Im n tuned very close to resonance with the\nquasibound states of odd parity shown on the right, with (a) kc\n=6.009\u2212 i0.008 (class Wint), (b) kc=6.228\u2212 i0.116 (class C), (c) kc\n=7.554\u2212 i0.063 (class Wext), (d) kc=7.847\u2212 i0.145 (class C), (e) kc\n=9.026\u2212 i0.022 (class A). In the top graph of each panel, the angu-\nlar dependence of the far field Ic (red) on the radiation direction f\nis compared to the angular dependence on the illumination direction\nf0 (note Ref. [28]) of the scattering cross-section s (green), the\nweighted delay time t (blue), and the x component of the force, Fx\n(purple)\u2014the four lines are almost indistinguishable. In the bottom\ngraph of each panel, the (squared) torque N2 (red) is compared to\nthe interference term Ic8\n2 (green), defined in Eq. (25). The blue curve\nis N2 evaluated at real n.

Note that the signal s0\nis, in general, of low contrast and, apart from a relatively\nstrong background modulation, rather featureless. Still, the\nenhanced scattering of the light field at resonance promises a\nmarked mechanical response, which we investigate in the\nremainder of this paper. Indeed, the signal of the mechanical\nresponse will display a much better contrast for a set of sys-\ntematically selected resonances.\nIII. MECHANICAL DETECTION OF RESONANCES\nA. Kinematics\nIn this subsection we provide general kinematic relations\nfor a two-dimensional resonator in a light field, which in the\nfollowing Secs. III B and III C will be used to characterize\nresonances and wave patterns.\nThe mechanical forces exerted by the light field on a di-\nelectric medium originate from the refraction and diffraction\nat the dielectric interfaces\u2014ultimately, from the deflection\n(and creation, at finite amplification) of the photons. The\nkinematics in the combined system of light field and medium\ncan be obtained from the conservation laws of total angular\nand linear momentum, which equate the torque and force\nacting on the medium to the deficit of the angular and linear\nmomenta carried by the electromagnetic field into and out of\nthe circular region A. (The center of this region is identified\nwith the point of reference for the torque, and in our example\nis taken as the center of the exterior circle.) Note that the\nconservation laws also hold in an amplifying medium, due to\nthe recoil of each created photon. The kinematic relations\nhence follow from integrals of Maxwell\u2019s stress tensor [29]\nover the boundary of A. After some algebra (for details see\nthe Appendix), we find the time-averaged force and torque\n(per unit of thickness of the resonator) in the compact form\n[30]\nFx + iFy =\n2\u00ab0i\nk om fam\nsindam+1\nsind*\n\u2212 am\nsoutdam+1\nsoutd*g , s17d\nN =\n2\u00ab0\nk2 om mfuam\nsindu2 \u2212 uam\nsoutdu2g . s18d\nIn absence of amplification and for plane-wave illumination,\nit is easily seen that the direction-averaged force and torque\nvanish from the unitarity constraints of the scattering matrix\nkFx + iFylf0 =\n\u2212 i\u00ab0\n2k o\nm,m8\nSmm8Sm+1,m8\n*\n= 0, s19d\nkNlf0 =\n\u00ab0\n2k2om mS1 \u2212 om8 uSmm8u2D = 0. s20d\nTwo simple quantities that do not vanish are the mean of the\nforce component Fi =Fxcos f0+Fysin f0 in forward direc-\ntion,\nF0 = kFilf0 =\n\u00ab0\n2k\nRe o\nm,m8\nsdmm8 \u2212 Sm8mSm8+1,m+1\n* d , s21d\nand the variance var N= kN2lf0 of the torque\nvar N =\n\u00ab0\n2\n4k4 o\nm,m8,ni\n8\nmm8Smn1\n* Smn2Sm8n3\n* Sm8n4. s22d\nHere, the prime at the sum enforces the restriction n1+n3\n=n2+n4.\nB. Resonances\nBecause scattering is enhanced at resonance, we expect\nthat var N and F0 are global characteristics of the resonances\ncomparable to s0 and tW, while N and Fi provide angularly\nresolved information as a function of the incident radiation\ndirection f0, analogously to s and t. The results in Figs. 2\nand 3 demonstrate this promise to hold true.\nFigure 2 shows the global characteristics s0, tW, var N,\nand F0 for the annular resonator as a function of k. The plot\ndemonstrates a clear correspondence of the resonant peaks in\nall four quantities. Evidently, each quantity probes another\naspect of the resonances, such that their relative weights are\ndifferent. As usual, the delay time tW displays the largest\npeaks for the very narrow resonances associated to long-\nliving quasibound states. Presently, the longest-living states\nare those of class Wint, followed by those of class Wext and A,\nwhile the states of class C are hardly visible here. The scat-\ntering cross-section s0 displays smaller peaks (sometimes,\ndips) on a modulated background, and does not provide a\ndistinctive discrimination between the different states.\nThe force and torque are sensitive to the wave pattern\nitself, and for the annular resonator display a marked re-\nSCHOMERUS, WIERSIG, AND HENTSCHEL PHYSICAL REVIEW A 70, 012703 (2004)\n012703-4\nsponse especially for the quasibound states of class Wext and\nA (for small k, also for class C). The peak-to-valley ratio in\nthe variance of the torque (e.g., <5 for the peak at k<6.2)\ncan take much larger values than in the scattering cross sec-\ntion (where the ratio rarely exceeds 1.2) for resonances with\na rather anisotropic internal wave pattern.\nThis principal conclusion of the present paper is sup-\nported in more detail by the five examples in Fig. 3. The\nwave patterns shown in the right panels are inhomogeneous\nto various extent, even though the inhomogeneity does not\nautomatically translate into very anisotropic far-field emis-\nsion patterns for these rather low values of RekcR. Let us\ninspect the associated resonance peaks in Fig. 2. For the\nquasibound state of Fig. 3(a), force, torque, and scattering\ncross section detect the resonance with comparable contrast;\nthe best signal is given by the delay time, which, however,\nmust be remembered to be an inconvenient tool for practical\nconsiderations. Figure 3(b) pertains to a comparatively short-\nliving mode (with large uIm kcu). This mode is hard to detect\nby the conventional probes, but gives a very clear signal in\nthe mechanical probes, especially, in the torque. For the case\nof Fig. 3(c), the best signals are provided by the force and by\nthe delay time, followed by the scattering cross section,\nwhile the torque is insensitive to this resonance. The case of\nFig. 3(d) illustrates that resonances with both a short life\ntime and a rather homogeneous wave pattern are hardly de-\ntected by any of the four probes\u2014such modes, however, are\nalso of subordinate interest in the practical applications. The\nmode of Fig. 3(e) gives a torque signal with a much higher\ncontrast than the force or the scattering cross section; only\nthe delay time signals the resonance to a similar extent.\nThe most remarkable difference in Fig. 3 is between pan-\nels (b) and (d)\u2014both modes of class C displayed there have\na short lifetime, which inhibits their detection by conven-\ntional means, but the mode of panel (b) is detectable by\noptomechanical means, in keeping with the larger anisotropy\ndisplayed by its wave pattern (note the regions of concen-\ntrated intensity above and below the interior circle).\nC. Far field\nIn the practical application of micro-optical lasers, the\nanisotropy of the internal wave pattern is a desired design\ngoal since it is the prerequisite for directed emission in the\nfar field. To which extent can the far field be inferred from\nthe angularly resolved information contained in N, F, s, and\nt? This rather innocent question turns out to be surprisingly\nsubtle in view of the following observation: In absence of\namplification (real k and n), the angle-of-incidence averaged\nfar field\nI0sfd = kIsfdlf0 s23d\nis independent of f. Here, we average over the angle of\nincidence f0 since the quasibound states are defined without\nreference to any excitation mechanism. The angle of inci-\ndence f0 enters the far field (5) via Eq. (14), and after taking\nthe average the earlier statement follows from the unitarity of\nthe scattering matrix. In other words, in the absence of am-\nplification, the angle-of-incidence averaged far-field radia-\ntion pattern does not carry any intrinsic information about\nthe quasibound states, even at resonant conditions.\nCan the far field of the quasibound states be inferred from\na more sophisticated analysis of Isf ;f0d, i.e., by taking the\ndependence of the angle of incidence into account? This\nwould require the delicate task to discard the component of\nthe light that is directly reflected at the first encounter of the\nboundary from the outside. The direct contribution is essen-\ntially independent of the quasibound states: the latter are\ndetermined by a constructive-interference condition for re-\nflection from the inside of the system while the directly re-\nflected radiation never ever enters the medium. For instance,\nin our model system, the directly reflected wave component\ncontains no information on the interior circle, which, how-\never, is crucial in the formation of all quasibound states.\nThe situation changes significantly at finite amplification:\nThen, already the angle-of-incidence averaged intensity\nI0sfd is modulated, and is influenced by the quasibound\nstates closest in k. At exact resonance in the complex\nk-plane, approximation (10) of the scattering matrix entails\nasoutd~ac with a large proportionality constant due to the\nresonant denominator. Hence, the contribution asind of the\nincident radiation can be neglected, and Isfd~ Icsfd as de-\nfined in Eq. (11), independent of the mode of excitation.\nFurthermore\nssf0d ~ tsf0d ~ uFxsf0du ~ Icsf = f0d , s24d\nsince again asoutd~ac dominates over asind in Eqs. (12), (13),\nand (17). Equation (24) entails a duality between the illumi-\nnation direction f0 and the radiation direction f. This dual-\nity relies on the time-reversal symmetry [28], which is incor-\nporated in Eq. (10) by the relation between ac and a\u02dcc. For a\nrepresentative set of resonances at real k and complex n, the\nfar field Icsfd is shown in the left panels of Fig. 3, along with\nthe angular dependence of s, t, uFxu, and N on the direction\nof incident radiation, f0.

The reflec-\ntion symmetry also suppresses N compared to nonsymmetric\nsystems: The otherwise dominant contribution from asoutd\n=ac vanishes for each given quasibound state, ommuac,mu2\n=0, because of pairwise cancellation of the terms with oppo-\nsite m. However, N is still enhanced compared to the non-\nresonant situation: A nonvanishing result (of order uk\u2212kcu\u22121)\nis obtained from the interference between the resonant state\n(with large coefficients) and the nonresonant states (with\nmoderate coefficients).

CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, the force and torque exerted by light pressure\non a dielectric resonator allow to detect resonances and help\nto characterize the wave patterns of the associated quasi-\nbound states. For anisotropic wave patterns that support a\nhigh angular-momentum transfer, the peak-to-valley ratio in\nthe mechanical probes (notably the torque) exceeds by far\nthe moderate values observed in the scattering cross section,\nwhich is notoriously insensitive to the wave pattern.\nWe put our work in the context of directed transmission\nfrom micro-optical lasers, and took amplification into ac-\ncount. Enhanced sensitivity to internal structure is also de-\nsired in several applications involving simpler passive or ab-\nsorbing media, such as cells with organelles or liquid drops\npolluted with inclusions.\nSince resonance provides a very effective scattering\nmechanism by constructive interference, the typical forces\nand torques estimated for common micrometer sized dielec-\ntric resonators under typical radiation conditions are in the\nrange of the optomechanical experiments mentioned in the\nintroduction. In the viscous rotation experiments, the reso-\nnances will depend on the refractive index of the surrounding\nliquid, which may not be desirable for a precise characteriza-\ntion of the resonator, but also introduces an additional poten-\ntially useful control parameter. Detection by microelectrome-\nchanical systems offers the advantage to control the\nresonator orientation with respect to the incoming radiation.\nThe numerical part of this work concentrated on the\nwave-optical regime, in which the wave length is not much\nsmaller than the geometric features of the system and inter-\nference patterns are most complex. Some micro-optical la-\nsers operate at smaller wave lengths (larger values of the\nwave number k) than accessed in our numerics. In this re-\ngime, semiclassical relations between the internal wave pat-\ntern and the far-field emission pattern can be formulated,\nwhich also relate the directed emission desired for micro-\noptical laser to the underlying anisotropy of the internal\nwave pattern. The results of this work hold the promise that\nin this semiclassical regime, modes with directed emission\ncan be identified by the torque. The selectivity of the torque\nfor anisotropic modes should be even enhanced for these\nlarger values of k by the following mechanism: Isotropic\nmodes frequently arise from a large collection of unstable\nray trajectories [31], and can be described as a superposition\nof random waves [32]. As k is increased, more and more\nrandom-wave components become available, and hence, the\nmechanical response is suppressed by self-averaging. Aniso-\ntropic modes are guided by just a few trajectories such that\nthe self-averaging mechanism does not apply to them, and\nconsequently they remain well detectable by their optom-\nechanical response.\nAPPENDIX: DERIVATION OF THE KINEMATICAL\nRELATIONS\nThe calculation of the force\nF = E\nS\ndSnT sA1d\nand the torque\nN = E\nS\ndSsnTd 3 r sA2d\n(where n is the unit vector in normal direction to the surface\nS) starts with the stress tensor\nT = \u00ab0SE ^ E \u2212 12E21D + 1m0SB ^ B \u2212 12B21D . sA3d\nIn the two-dimensional case, we integrate over the circle ]A\nof radius R (the physical force and torque are obtained by a\nmultiplication with the thickness of the sample), and it is\nnatural to work in polar coordinates.\nDepending on the polarization, we insert the electromag-\nnetic field\nHE = Re e\u2212ivtcez,B = Im v\u22121e\u2212ivtsR\u22121]fcer \u2212 ]rcefd ,J sTMd ,\nHB = c\u22121 Re e\u2212ivtcez,E = \u2212 c Im v\u22121e\u2212ivtsR\u22121]fcer \u2212 ]rcefd ,J sTEd ,\nsA4d\nwhere the wave function fulfills the Helmholtz equation (3)\nand is decomposed in the basis of Hankel function, Eq.
