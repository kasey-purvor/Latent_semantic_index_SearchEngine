As it involves orienting nuclear spins in living tissue with a high magnetic field, in the majority \nof cases the patient must be placed in the centre of a large magnet in a small space to optimise image \nresolution: the scanning procedure requires that the patient be inserted \u2013 either head first or feet first \n\u2013 into the bore of the machine (which has a diameter of 55 cm and a length of 180 cm) and that they \nremain there for a considerable length of time.  Additionally, if the head is the focus of the scan, this \nis enclosed in a head coil in order to keep it still.  Published reports typically indicate that 15% of \npatients describe severe claustrophobic reactions while in the bore of the machine.  Apart from the \ndistress caused by this, such reactions can result in the degrading of images obtained, or in premature \ntermination of the procedure [1, 2, 3, 4].  Records at a local hospital for instance, indicate that over a \nseven year period, 1% of people undergoing MRI could not complete the scan as a result of \nclaustrophobic reactions. Some patients, and non-patient participants in costly research programmes, \nrefuse to enter the scanner at all.   \n \nIt has been reported that 13% of patients undergoing MRI experience panic attacks during the \nprocedure [5].  When such panic reactions occur in agoraphobic situations, they are known to be \nassociated with the triggering and\/or exacerbation of agoraphobic fear [6].  This observation would \nlead us to expect that in vulnerable individuals the MRI procedure alone could lead not only to the \ntriggering of pre-existing claustrophobia, but to the onset of claustrophobia itself: there is some very \nlimited evidence to suggest that in some patients claustrophobia may be initially provoked by the \nexperience of being in the scanner [7].   \n \nStudies on claustrophobia, and the development of treatments, were previously largely behavioural \n  \n4\n4\n[8,9], but more recently, the focus has turned to the role of cognitions. Rachman and colleagues \nhave demonstrated that the experience of claustrophobic anxiety and its reduction is closely related to \nbeliefs about suffocation and restriction, indicating that cognitions play an important role in \nclaustrophobia.  In experiments looking at the reduction of fear in claustrophobia for example, [10] \nthe authors found that they could identify two key cognitions which \u2013 if endorsed by people with \nclaustrophobia \u2013 predicted those who did not benefit from repeated exposure to the claustrophobic \nsituation and, in some instances, even experienced an increase in claustrophobic fear.  Those beliefs \nwere: \u201cI am going to pass out\u201d and \u201cI am going to suffocate\u201d.  They also noted that the experience of \nintense bodily symptoms (similar to those usually associated with panic attacks) prevents people \nfrom becoming used to the situation.  Those most frequently reported by participants were: shortness \nof breath (endorsed by 100% of the non-habituators), dizziness (86%) and choking\/smothering \nsensations (57%).  A follow up study, [11] gathered more extensive data relating to the interaction \nbetween cognition and peripheral physiology, which provided further evidence for the importance of \nbeliefs and bodily sensations and confirmed that claustrophobia is composed of two main elements \u2013 \nfear of suffocation and fear of restriction.   Rachman later went further and suggested that the beliefs \n\u2018I will be trapped\u2019, I will suffocate\u2019 and \u2018I will lose control\u2019 are critical cognitions in the maintenance \nof claustrophobia which, when eroded by treatment, can collapse the \u2018cognitive constellation\u2019 [12 p \n179] surrounding the claustrophobic anxiety and lead to its elimination. \n \nStudying claustrophobia in the context of MRI provides a further opportunity to examine the factors \nwhich may be involved in its aetiology, maintenance and treatment.  In [5] for instance the authors \nassessed fear in relation to the claustrophobia-related cognitions of 80 patients undergoing first-time \nscans.  Twenty five percent of the patients experienced moderate to severe anxiety, 13.75% suffered \na panic attack and 4% stopped the scan prematurely due to anxiety.  Scores on a multiple-item \n  \n5\n5\nclaustrophobia questionnaire [11] predicted which patients would suffer the most distress and \ndiscriminated between those who did, and did not, report panic during the scan.  Similarly, measures \nof subjective anxiety during the scan were correlated with thoughts characteristic of claustrophobia \n(restriction and suffocation).   However, Harris et al. [13] using a questionnaire (MRI-FSS) derived \nfrom the Fear Survey Schedule [14] showed that fears associated with the unpleasant physical \nproperties of the scanner itself (such as confinement, noise and isolation) were a better predictor of \npanic in the scan than either the claustrophobia questionnaire [11]or a measure of state anxiety.  A \nlater study, [15] evaluated the MRI-FSS and found that it could predict symptoms of panic and \nanxiety in the scanner better than a variety of other measures \n \nThe present study therefore aims to further explore the role of the above factors in the experience of \nclaustrophobic anxiety, in the context of the MRI scanner, and to identify the related cognitions.  It \nwill examine the way in which this anxiety is related to negative cognitions such as fear of \nsuffocation, of losing control or of being trapped and also how such anxiety is mitigated \u2013 or \nexacerbated - by the use of safety strategies and the individual\u2019s perception of the physical sensations \nexperienced.  In [16] for example the authors found that encouraging the use of safety behaviours by \nthose undergoing treatment for claustrophobia was related to more fear both after treatment and later \nat follow-up.   \n \nClearly in the case of MRI scans there are other issues to be taken into account which could increase \nthe patient's level of anxiety and raise their vulnerability to claustrophobic reactions.  As noted above, \nin many cases the scan is investigating a problem of a serious nature. In consideration of this the \npresent study also investigates the patients\u2019 background levels of anxiety, depression and health \nanxiety in order to control for the effect of these on levels of anxiety.  Subsidiary research questions \n  \n6\n6\nconcern whether the patient\u2019s position in the scanner (head first or feet first) and whether or not \nthey were put into the head coil had an impact on their anxiety level.  The answers to these questions \nmay have considerable practical value in improving patient experience of scanning procedures.    \n \nThe aims of the study then, are: 1) establish the factors related to the anxiety experienced in the \nscanner; 2) to explore the cognitions most associated with this anxiety; 3) to investigate whether \nposition in the scanner or wearing a head coil has an impact on anxiety levels; and finally 4) to \nexplore whether previous experience in the scanner is related to the levels of anxiety experienced \n \nMETHOD \n \nParticipants \nThe participants were outpatients between the ages of 18 and 82 (mean age 45.34 years) at the \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging unit.  Data were collected from patients over four consecutive weeks.  \nOne hundred and seventy two adult outpatients were approached initially; of these 146 agreed to \nparticipate.  16 pulled out for a variety of reasons (5 were too anxious to continue and 11 did not have \ntime) after the first stage, leaving a final number of 130 people who agreed to take part.  Finally, they \nwere also given a pack of questionnaires to return by post: 100 people returned this set of \nquestionnaires.   A check was carried out as to whether the 33 people who did not complete the pre-\nscan questionnaires were different in their subsequent ratings of anxiety and claustrophobic \nsymptoms to the 97 who did fill them in.  There were no differences between the groups. A check \nwas also carried out as to whether the 30 people who did not return the final set of questionnaires \nwere different in terms of any of the measures, including claustrophobic anxiety, to the 100 who did \nreturn them: they were not.  There were no significant differences between the groups on any of the \n  \n7\n7\nmeasures of claustrophobia, and we can therefore be confident that our sample was not biased.  \n \nDemographic details gathered were: age, gender and marital status. Details were also obtained of \ntheir position in scanner (head or feet first), whether or not their scan necessitated their head being \nheld stable in the head coil (a quadrature bird cage design), length of time since last scan, and number \nof previous scans. \nAs the demographic details questions were part of the pack returned by post, details of only those 100 \npeople who returned them are available: 57 patients were female and 43 male;  mean age 44.31, \nrange 18 to 82; years of education since age 12 mean 6.63 years, range 0 to 18 years; mean number \nof previous scans was 0.71, range 0 to 6, (60 patients had had no previous scan, 22 had had one \npreviously, 10 two previously, 5 three previously, 2 four previously and 1 six previously).  The mean \ntime since last scan was 17 months (range 1 week to 9 years); 61 were married, 27 single, 6 divorced, \n4 widowed and 2 separated. \nNot all of the participants were able to fill in all the questionnaires, hence the varying number of \nparticipants reported in the various analyses in the results section below.   \n \nMeasures \nAnxiety score \n This is a single-item measure of subjective anxiety.  It asked patients to rate how often they \nexperienced anxiety in the scanner on a 9-point scale from 0 (\u2018never\u2019) to 8 (\u2018all the time\u2019).   \nAdditional prompts were above the number 2 (\u2018rarely\u2019), 4 (\u2018about half the time\u2019) and 6 (\u2018often\u2019).  As \na check on the reliability and validity of this measure, scores were compared with scores on the \nSpielberger State anxiety index (STAI), completed before and after the scan, and the Beck Anxiety \nInventory (BAI). See below for further details of these.   Anxiety scores were highly correlated with \n  \n8\n8\nthe pre-scan STAI (r=0.576,  p<0.01),  the post scan STAI (r=0.650,  p<0.01) and the BAI \n(r=0.565,  p<0.01).    \nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [19] \nSpielberger STAIy-2 (State-Trait Anxiety Index) self evaluation questionnaire. This study only uses \nthe \u2018state\u2019 part of the questionnaire in order to reduce the burden on participants and because trait \nanxiety is not the focus of the study. This was included as a check on the validity on the single item \nmeasure of anxiety.  This consists of a series of 20 statements (e.g. I feel calm; I feel at ease; I am \njittery; I am overexcited and rattled; I feel confident) which the respondent is asked to endorse on a \nfour-point scale (not at all, moderately so, very much so) according to how they feel \u201cright now at \nthis minute\u201d.  Initial construction and validation of this questionnaire was extremely rigorous and it \nhas been used extensively as an anxiety measure.  The internal consistency for the version, used here, \nis a Cronbach-Alpha coefficient of .92.     \n \nClaustrophobic Situations Questionnaire (CLAUSITQ) \nThe most widely used measure of claustrophobia has been the Rachman and Taylor claustrophobia \nquestionnaire [11]. However a large proportion of the items on this scale refer to situations that the \npatient is unlikely to have experienced (e.g. '200 feet below the surface of the water in a small \nsubmarine' and 'standing for 15 minutes in a straitjacket') so its ecological validity may be \ncompromised. The 21-item questionnaire used in the present study was designed by the authors to \nadditionally assess level of claustrophobic fear in everyday situations - which all of the subjects were \nexpected to have experienced.  Examples are, 'going into a small cubicle in a public toilet' or 'going \ninto a lift', \u2018going into a cupboard under the stairs\u2019.  An initial pool of items was generated on the \nbasis of pilot work, consisting of situations which involved going into or staying in small spaces.  \nAfter further piloting, this list was modified so that only items which reflected claustrophobic fear \n  \n9\n9\nremained while items which showed ceiling or floor effects were removed. Participants were \nrequired to rate their level of anxiety in these situations on a 9-point scale with anchors at every \nsecond point: 0 = not at all anxious, 2 = slightly anxious, 4 = moderately anxious, 6 = very anxious, 8 \n= extremely anxious. The internal consistency of the questionnaire, assessed using Cronbach's alpha \nwas \u03b1 = 0.93 indicating high internal consistency.   \n \nThe Strategies Questionnaire (STRATQ) \nThe Strategies Questionnaire, was designed by the authors to measure common avoidance and safety-\nseeking behaviours, was constructed using patients' reports of their experiences of the scan collected \nduring the pilot study. It consisted of 8 items assessing how often people used particular strategies to \nhelp them cope with the scan. These were: closed your eyes, used deep breathing, tried to relax, tried \nto visualise other things, tried to blank the whole thing out, tried to think about other things, tried to \nkeep control over your mind and tried to concentrate on the procedure. The questionnaire asked the \nparticipants to rate \u2018how often you did the following things during your MRI scan\u2019  on a 9-point scale \nwith anchors at the following points: 0 = never, 2 = rarely, 4 = about half the time, 6 = often and 8 = \nall the time. Internal consistency, assessed using Cronbach's alpha was \u03b1=0.65. \n \nThe Panic Symptoms Questionnaire (PSQ) \nThis is a 13 item scale.  Items are the 13 common physical symptoms of panic as specified by DSM \nIV [17].  Participants were required to rate how often they experienced these symptoms  on a scale of \n0 (never) to 8 (all the time).  Internal consistency, assessed by Cronbach's alpha was high: \u03b1 = 0.89 . \n \nClaustrophobia Restriction and Suffocation Questionnaire (CRSQ)  \nA short (12-item) version of the Rachman and Taylor questionnaire described above [11], adapting \n  \n10\n10\nprevious items to make them more specifically relevant to the restriction and suffocation \ncomponents of claustrophobia.  For example, where in the longer questionnaire the item was \u2018getting \ninto a sleeping bag\u2019, the item here is \u2018lying in a tight sleeping bag enclosing legs and arms, tied at the \nneck unable to get out for 15 minutes. This is a 5 point scale and participants are asked to indicate \nhow anxious they would be \u2018having a pillow over your face\u2019, \u2018in a public washroom and the lock \njams\u2019, handcuffed for 15 minutes\u2019 \u2018swimming with a nose plug\u2019 and so on. Anchors were \u2018not at all \nanxious\u2019 to \u2018extremely anxious\u2019.  Each scale has 6 items belonging to it:  the Restriction items have a  \nCronbach\u2019s Alpha of  \u03b1 =0 .90 and the Suffocation items a Cronbach\u2019s Alpha of  \u03b1 =0.82 \n \nThe Claustrophobic Cognitions Questionnaire (CCOGQ) \nThe Claustrophobic Cognitions Questionnaire is based on the Phobic Cognitions Questionnaire [18].   \nAdditionally, it contains items derived from verbal reports of patients collected during pilot work. It \nasks participants to rate how often each of the 21 thoughts occurred to them while in the scanner.  \nItems were scored on the same 9-point scale (where 0 = never and 8 = all the time.  In order to save \ntime, only the frequency of the thoughts (rather than the distress associated with them) was elicited: \nprevious studies have shown that there is such a high correlation between scales relating to frequency \nof and distress (caused by intrusive thoughts in this instance), that one is redundant.   The cognitions \nlisted are a combination of thoughts directly related to the experience of the machine such as, 'I am \ngoing to get stuck in here', 'The machine is harming me' and negative thoughts as to the consequences \nof anxiety such as 'I am going to faint in here', 'I will have a heart attack'. The Cronbach alpha value \nwas \u03b1 = 0.94 indicating high internal consistency.  Concurrent validity was tested by examining the \nrelationship between it and the full 21 item standardised measure of claustrophobia (CLC: Rachman \nand Taylor 1993) described above: r=0.452, p<0.0001 \n. \n  \n11\n11\nOther measures \nStandardised clinical questionnaires were as follows:  \nBeck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) [20].  \nDepression: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [21].  \nHealth anxiety: Health Anxiety measure (consisting of three parts, the HAI, measuring \nhypchondriacal symptoms, HypA measuring avoidance of illness-related issues and HypR measuring \nreassurance seeking about health [22]. \n \nProcedure \nPre-scan \nPatients were approached five minutes before their scan and invited to participate in the study. \nIf they agreed they completed the measure of state anxiety (STAI).  In addition they were given an \ninformation sheet to read about the study, and written consent was obtained.    If patients were called \nwithin five minutes, completion of this questionnaire was not always possible.  Staff in the unit were \nvery aware of the anxiety-inducing aspects of the process and were very supportive and helpful to \nanxious patients.  The diameter of the scanner bore was 58 centimetres horizontally, and 42 \ncentimetres vertically.  \n \nPost-scan \nFive minutes after the scan, patients were given the single item anxiety measure, the STAI again, the \nPanic Symptoms Questionnaire (PSQ), the Strategies Questionnaire (STRATQ) and the \nClaustrophobic Cognitions Questionnaire (COGQ).  In view of the large number of questionnaire \nmeasures to be completed participants were allowed to complete some of the post scan measures at \nhome and were given a prepaid addressed envelope (for the purposes of analysis no distinction was \n  \n12\n12\nmade between post scan measures completed in the clinic or at home). The home pack contained \nthe Claustrophobic Situations Questionnaire (CLAUSITQ), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the \nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI),  The Health Anxiety, Hypochondriacal Avoidance and \nReassurance seeking scales (HAI, HypA and HypR)  and the claustrophobia restriction and \nsuffocation scale (CRSQ).  Figure 1 shows this process graphically. \nFIGURE 1 \n \n \nRESULTS \nFactors related to the experience of anxiety in the scanner. \nThe first analysis addressed the question of which factors were important in the experience of anxiety \nin the scanner. \n First, the data set was split into three groups in line with the wording of the anxiety measure:- a low \nanxiety group who scored 2 or under on the measure of subjective anxiety experienced during the \nscan (i.e. they rarely felt anxious or felt no anxiety at all)  a medium anxiety group who scored 3, 4 or \n5  (i.e.  they were anxious less than half the time but more often than rarely) and a high anxiety group \nwho scored 6 or more on the anxiety measure (i.e. they felt anxious about half the time or more).  \nOf the 130 people who responded to this item, 70 (53.85% of the sample) were in the high anxiety \ngroup, 35 (26.93%) in the medium anxiety group and 25 (19.23%) were in the low anxiety group.  \nThere were no differences between these three groups on measures of health anxiety, \nhypochondriacal avoidance and reassurance-seeking, or depression.   \nConcurrent validity of the anxiety measure was explored by one way analysis of variance: a \nsignificant difference was found between these groups on the standardised measure of state anxiety \n(STAI) administered immediately after the scan (F2,94=37.93, p=0.0001).  Tukey\u2019s test revealed that \n  \n13\n13\nthe groups were all different from each other, with means of 27.43, 39.11 and 47.22 on the STAI \nin the low, medium and high anxiety groups respectively.   \n \nThe relationship between levels of anxiety and a variety of measures were then explored.   The three \ngroups (low, medium and high anxiety) were examined in relation to their scores on the measures of \nclaustrophobic restriction and suffocation (CRSQ), strategies employed to contain claustrophobic \nanxiety in the scanner (STRAT), symptoms of panic felt in the scanner (PSQ) and cognitions about \nthe consequences of being in the scanner (CCOGQ).  The groups differed on all measures, however, \nTukey\u2019s test revealed that the differences were to be found between the high and low anxiety groups, \nwith the medium group not being different to either, except with regard to panic symptoms and \nclaustrophobic cognitions, where all three groups were significantly different from each other. Table \n1  below shows these results in full. \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe relationship between cognitions and anxiety \nThe second research question was first addressed by exploring whether particular cognitions are \nrelated to the amount of anxiety experienced during the scan, and the relative importance of these.  \nA stepwise multiple regression was carried out using the same variables as above: claustrophobic \nrestriction and suffocation, strategies employed to contain claustrophobic anxiety in the scanner \n(STRAT), symptoms of panic felt in the scanner (PSQ) and cognitions about the consequences of \nbeing in the scanner (CCOGQ). The single-item measure of anxiety was the outcome variable. Only \nthree of five possible explanatory variables were significantly predictive of anxiety: the order in \nwhich they were entered into the regression model is shown in Table 2. \n  \n14\n14\n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe strongest predictor of anxiety appears to be the perception of the amount of time spent having \npanic symptoms in the scanner, followed by the number of thoughts about the (negative) \nconsequences of being in the machine and finally by the number of techniques employed to control \nthe anxiety. \n \nThe details of the second research question were further investigated.  Given the apparent \nimportance of the number of negative thoughts to the experience of anxiety, this variable was \nfurther assessed in order to determine  the relative importance of type of thought to the experience \nof anxiety.  To do this the cognitions were divided into 6 categories: fear of being trapped (TRAP \ne.g. I am going to get trapped in here, I am going to get stuck); fear of suffocation (SUFF e.g I will \nnot be able to breathe; I will suffocate in here); fear of losing control (CONTROL e.g. I will lose \ncontrol; I will go insane); fear of coming to harm (HARM e.g. I am going to have a stroke in here; I \nwill die in here; I will have a heart attack); fear of the machine causing harm (M-HARM e.g. \nSomething will go wrong with the machine when I\u2019m in it; the machine is harming me); fear of \nmaking a fool of oneself (FOOL e.g. I will do something that will spoil the scan; I will make a fool \nof myself).  These items were entered into a multiple regression analysis with scores on the anxiety \nmeasure as the outcome variable.   Only three of the six possible explanatory variables (types of \nthought) were significantly predictive: the order in which they were selected as predictors is shown \nin Table 3 \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n  \n15\n15\nSo, looking at the relative importance of types of beliefs within the set of claustrophobic \ncognitions alone, the frequency of fears of suffocation, of the machine causing harm and of losing \ncontrol to were found to predict the amount of anxiety felt in the scanner most effectively.  \n \nPosition in the scanner or wearing a head coil: the impact on anxiety levels \nThe third question to be addressed was whether more anxiety was experienced by: those with a head \ncoil or those without; and those who were put into the scanner feet first as opposed to head first.  \nThere were no between group differences in initial levels of state anxiety.  Importantly there were \nalso no differences in the specific post scan measure of scanner related  anxiety in either the \ncomparison of head coil and no head coil condition or the head vs feet first condition.  In all cases, \nt<1.   \n   \nThe relationship between previous experience in the scanner and levels of anxiety.  \nThe final analysis explored whether there were any differences in anxiety ratings as a function of \nnumber of previous scans, and length of time since last scan..  Patients were grouped according to \nwhether they had had no previous scans (n=78), one previous scan (n=30), or more than one previous \nscan (n=22, range 2-6).  Due to the different sizes of participant in each of these groups, a Kruskal-\nWallis test was used, with anxiety as the dependent variable.  There was a significant difference \nbetween the groups ((F2,127=4.23,  p=0.016), with mean ranks of 71.78, 63.32 and 46.23 respectively, \nindicating that the more often the patient had been scanned previously, the less anxiety they reported.   \nHowever, there was no relationship between anxiety and the amount of time since last scan. \n \nDISCUSSION \n \n  \n16\n16\nThere were four research questions in the present study.:- to establish the predictors of the \nanxiety experienced in the scanner; to explore which cognitions are most associated with this anxiety; \nto investigate whether position in the scanner or wearing a head coil had an impact on anxiety levels; \nand to explore whether previous experience in the scanner is related to the levels of anxiety \nexperienced. \n \nA variety of factors were found to be of possible importance in the experience of anxiety in the \nscanner, including the amount of time spent having physical symptoms of panic, the number and type \nof cognitions judged to have been experienced while in the machine and the number of strategies \nemployed to control levels of anxiety.  This finding is in line with McIsaac et al. [5].  The results \nsuggest that the most important predictor of the amount of anxiety perceived during the scan was the \nperceived amount of time spent having physical symptoms of panic.  The number of strategies \nemployed to offset this was also predictive and while unsurprising \u2013 in that anxiety symptoms and \ncoping mechanism\/safety strategies are always closely related \u2013 this does nevertheless contribute to \nour understanding of the process.    \n \nThe most interesting finding concerned the cognitions most associated with this anxiety.  These were \nspecific claustrophobic cognitions to do with suffocation, with the harm caused by the machine and \nwith ideas of control. The next most important predictors were strategies used to cope in the machine.   \nThis is broadly in line with the findings of the authors of [13] who suggest that it is the unpleasant \nphysical properties of the scanner itself which is the most important factor in the triggering of \nanxiety, and with other research[23]  which notes the importance of beliefs around the subject of self \ncontrol, to the experience of being in the scanner.   \n \n  \n17\n17\nAdditionally, it was found that there was no effect of position in the scanner or use of a head coil \non the level of anxiety experienced in the scanner. This contrasts with the results of the McIsaac et al \n[5] study. However, given that fear of suffocation seems to be more salient than fear of restriction, \nand the head coil is open, this may be a partial explanation of this lack of effect.  Similarly, as the \nbore in the machine used in this study was open at both ends the final resting position is the same \nwhichever way it is entered.  It may also be the case that for many, MRI is stressful regardless of \nposition or use of head coil and possibly those who interpret bodily symptoms in a catastrophic \nmanner may already be at the ceiling of possible responses, so whether or not there are added \nstressors will make little difference. \n \nFinally, there is some evidence to suggest that people undergoing a series of scans become less \nanxious over time. However, as the majority of people only undergo one scan, this does not \nsignificantly affect the fact that it is important to understand the triggers of anxiety for those \nundergoing their first experience.   \n \nThis study does suffer from some methodological limitations.  A few of the participants were called \naway to their scans before being able to complete the initial state anxiety questionnaire.  Most of the \nquestionnaires were filled out after the scan in the clinic, or at home.  However as the claustrophobia \nquestionnaires have been shown to have high reliability, and are thus robust over time, it would not \nbe expected that they would be affected by this.  Again, although some 30 people did not send back \nthe questionnaires, 100 people did, which is a very high response rate.  Additionally, there was no \ndifference on any of the target variables between participants who did and who did not fill in all the \nquestionnaires so the sample does not appear to be subject to any particular bias.  Another limitation \nis that the participants were required to complete quite a large number of questionnaires: however, in \n  \n18\n18\nan exploratory study such as the one reported here it is important to be inclusive in order to \ncapture as many of the possibly relevant psychological factors as possible.   \n \nAnother possible limitation of the study is that different staff were dealing with the patients at \ndifferent times.   Physicians\u2019 communication styles and ways of dealing with patients have been \nfound to have an influence on treatment adherence for example [24, 25].  This was not examined in \nthe present study but could be a fruitful area for future research, as could staffing levels and work \nflow speed. \n \nTaken together, the present study and the studies described above also suggest that the claustrophobic \nresponse to MRI has much in common with other anxiety disorders, (particularly panic disorder and \nof course other specific phobias), in terms of characteristic beliefs about threat and catastrophe.   \nThere is also evidence that underlying the claustrophobic reaction is a vestigial, powerful and \nprimitive fear of being suffocated: human fear reactions when trapped in enclosed spaces are very \nsimilar to those shown by animals when prevented from escaping a situation [26].  However, this is \nnot to say that such fears are beyond the reach of reason \u2013 as has been illustrated here, the cognitive \ncomponent may be important even when the origin of the fear can be described as innate.  \n \nAnother important point is that while there may be individual differences in the degree to which \npeople fear restriction or suffocation, as in other phobias, the catastrophic interpretation of this fear \nand the bodily sensations that go along with it appear to be driven by specific and particular beliefs \nsuch as those identified here about the perception of possible harm, of control and of coping \nstrategies: this could be the distinguishing factor between those who panic in enclosed spaces and \nthose who experience identical physiological symptoms of anxiety but who do not panic. \n  \n19\n19\n \nThe implications of this study for hospital and clinical staff are that they may be able to identify \npatients who are likely to terminate the scan prematurely, or become extremely anxious and restive \nduring the scan, using a brief measure targeting the factors here found to be important in the \nexperience of claustrophobia in the scanner.  This could be sent out to patients before their \nappointment, potential claustrophobia identified and ameliorative measures put in place:  they may \ngiven for example, additional information about the amount of air needed to sustain life and the air \nflow in the scanner, as well as factual information about the physical properties of the scanner, with \nan emphasis on the safety aspects.  Some patients may need more specific interventions relating to \npanic and this can be drawn from the literature on cognitive models of panic disorder.  New advances \nin the technology may also bring their own challenges: the development of array coils for example, \nwhich involve laying flat panels around the targeted area, in some cases several together, possibly in \naddition to the patient being strapped to the scanner table, may increase the incidence of \nclaustrophobic reactions and would be useful to investigate in the future.  \n    \nOne session treatment for specific phobias has been found to be highly effective (e.g.[25]) and those \npatients with pre-existing claustrophobia may benefit from one-session treatment \u2013 particularly if \nthere is a replica (non functioning) scanner such as those found in research departments.  The first \nauthor of the study presented here for example, building on the findings reported, was able to carry \nout a brief but effective intervention with a severely claustrophobic woman who was unable to \ntolerate the thought of entering a scanner in order to have a vital head examination.  This intervention \nwas based on the factors found to be most associated with anxiety in the scanner and the strategies \ncommonly used to combat it:  she was given information about the nature and course of anxiety, the \ntype of experiences she may expect, and facts about the safety of the equipment.  She was also taught \n  \n20\n20\na very simple breathing exercise.  All of these contributed to an increase in her sense of being \nable to exercise some control over herself in the situation and enabled her to tolerate being in the \nscanner for a considerable length of time.  These are techniques derived from cognitive behaviour \ntherapy and relaxation training, shaped by findings from the present study and targeted at the specific \nsituation of being in a scanner -  a situation which shares many of characteristics found in the more \ngeneral experience of claustrophobia.   \n \nBrief interventions have been found to be particularly effective in the treatment of specific phobias:  \n\u00d6st et al. for instance [26] compared one versus five sessions of exposure and five sessions of \ncognitive therapy in the treatment of claustrophobia and found that all were equally effective.  Other \nstudies have focussed on the importance of the availability of aids to safety (such as the ability to \ncommunicate with the experimenter, access to fresh air), even when these are not actually used [27].  \nThis resonates with the finding here that issues around the perception of control may be important.  \nPrevious studies of interventions with people who were phobic of undergoing dental treatment using \nvideo information and coping techniques for example, have been highly effective [28, 29] as have \ntechniques involving emotional processing (e.g.[30] )   \n \nThe study presented here has provided more evidence to enable further refinement and distillation of \nsuch techniques in the context of MRI scanning.  It is hoped that this may be helpful in preventing \nearly termination of scans or reducing motion artefact in the image produced.  The next stage will be \nto further refine and test a short MRI-specific diagnostic instrument in order to be able to accurately \nidentify those people most in need of help before they attend the examination session, and to test the \nefficacy of a targeted intervention in a clinical setting. \n \n  \n21\n21\nAcknowledgements \n  \n22\n22\n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
