Encounters between the Islands and the wider world began centuries ago with the visits of collectors of sea cucumbers and birds\u2019 nests, Malay pirates and Burmese slave traders. The latter went in search of the Islands\u2019 indigenous peoples, hunter-gatherers who they seized and sold into slavery in Southeast Asia. The islanders\u2019 fierce resistance against such exploitation perhaps explains why, from as early as the tenth century, travellers including Marco Polo later on described them as ferocious cannibals with horse or dog-shaped faces.ii But it seems also that traders perpetuated this representation, as well as the idea that the Islands were totally isolated from the outside world, in order to hold onto their commercial advantage. During the eighteenth century, the East India Company became interested in the Andamans because it was anxious about the implications of the islanders\u2019 hostility to outsiders in a region criss-crossed by increasingly important trade routes. It made a short-lived attempt at colonization in the 1790s, when there were four major population clusters \u2013 the Sentinelese, the Jarawa, the Onge and the Andamanese (sometimes called the Great Andamanese) - and twelve dialect groups. Permanent settlement came in the aftermath of the 1857 Indian Revolt, when the British established the Andamans as a penal colony. In 1780, it was estimated that there were 6,500 indigenous inhabitants; in the year 2000 that figure stood at just 485.iii   \n 4 \nThere are significant parallels between the history of indigenous-settler contact in the Andaman Islands and in other colonial frontiers - what Mary Louise Pratt and Greg Dening have called contact zones and beach crossings, respectively - across Asia, North America, New Zealand, the Pacific and southern Africa.iv As Philip D. Morgan writes in an overview of encounters between British and indigenous peoples during the period 1500-1800, though we must be mindful of the importance of locality, there were similarities across time and place at moments of first contact.v As we will see, eighteenth and nineteenth-century colonial officials drew on their understanding of other geographical contexts to bring their often-violent encounters with the Andamanese into larger frameworks of imperial practice, knowledge and representation. Given their shared histories of penal colonization and indigenous displacement, comparisons between the Andamans and Australia are perhaps especially striking.vi In relation to the significance of a common framework, I am taken also with Morgan\u2019s invocation of the importance of ethnography in the creation of \u2018the encounter\u2019 itself, as explorers, settlers and others found themselves unable to view indigenous peoples beyond the lens of previous representations.vii With respect to the Andamans, the British drew on a wide repertoire of indigenous representations from across the globe, incorporating and extending contemporary understandings of \u2018race\u2019, gender and subalternity.viii\n \n They certainly took for granted also centuries-old views that islanders were fierce, bestial man-eaters, as was believed both in Europe and in mainland South and Southeast Asia at the time.  \n 5 \nIn this paper I will explore something of the local specificities and broader imperial context of the colonial frontier in the Andamans during the period 1771-1864, though a discussion of the kidnap of indigenous peoples. This represents the period from the first British captivity to the spatial consolidation of indigenous confinement within an institution the British called the Andaman home. I will show that the British viewed captivity as an important means through which they could learn about Andaman islanders, as well as through which they could create cultural interlocutors who could move to the settlement\u2019s advantage between the penal colony, the beach and the forest. In this, they drew on their understanding of indigenous encounters beyond the Bay of Bengal. There was a significant gendered dimension too, with settlers threatening or unleashing sexual violence against island women. This impacted on colonial policy and native experience in significant ways. In contextualising this discussion, it is important to underscore the point that during the 1790s and again in the 1850s and 60s the Andamans was a penal colony of Indian convicts and its associated infrastructure rather than a free settlement, and so there was no straightforward encounter between \u2018colonized\u2019 and \u2018colonizers\u2019. Not only did the treatment of islanders substantially mirror that of Indian convicts, but also during the middle of the nineteenth century convicts themselves became imbricated in \u2018contact missions\u2019 with indigenous peoples, as well as in their kidnap and confinement. For this reason, when I write of \u2018settlers\u2019 I do so in collective reference to officials, convicts, naval brigadesmen and\/ or other guards.  \n 6 \nBefore turning to a discussion of what I call the experimental captivity of islanders during the late eighteenth century, I would like to mention briefly the methodological positioning of this piece. In common with many other frontier contexts, there are no islander-generated contemporary written or oral perspectives on the colonization of the Andamans. Beyond weekly official reports, correspondence with the mainland, and short mention in the memoirs of exactly one naval brigadesman and one convict, islander perspective is found in what Morgan describes as the margins of colonial discourse; in the \u2018asides, silences, gestures, snatches of conversation, snippets of action.\u2019ix And the location of indigeneity within a colonial world-view is, of course, deeply problematic. For this reason, some anthropologists in this and other contexts have taken a step back from the records to seek likely perspective in alternative cultures and cosmologies, or to seek out orally transmitted memories of colonialism.x Squaring up to archival absences, other scholars have even flirted at the margins of literary reconstruction.xi\n \n This paper proposes a reading of between the cracks of the official record to offer limited glimpses into both the tactics and, more speculatively, indigenous experiences of captivity and kidnap in the Andamans. I present the relative silence of islanders deliberately, for archival elisions are a crucial reminder of the violence that underpinned this grossly unequal encounter, the relative (though obviously not total) powerlessness of the Andamanese in the face of colonial pistols and rifles, and the domination that eventually sealed their fate.  \nExperimental captivity, 1771-1857 \n 7 \nA significant element of the colonial exploration of the Andamans was islander kidnap. As its commercial interests in the Bay of Bengal grew during the second half of the eighteenth century, the British took captive and observed closely Andamanese islanders; watching, touching, feeling and measuring them, listening for languages that they might understand. Surveyors mused on their likely racial origin, taking for granted a priori ethnographic representations of their savagery, but desirous of piecing together their biological, social and cultural \u2018race\u2019 in order to confront them with material evidence of British civilization and superiority, and thus to persuade them of the benefits of colonization. Debates about monogenesis and polygenesis (human descent from one common or multiple ancestors) were never far below the surface. Marine surveyor Captain John Ritchie produced the first written account of the colonial encounter with islanders in 1771. He described the terror of two islanders taken from their canoes and put on board his survey ship, writing: \u2018they were two lads about 14 years of age; and no doubt, thought that they would be immediately sacrificed: despair was strongly painted in their faces and neither of them could support their weight, but fell upon the deck, as if they had lost the use of their limbs.\u2019 His interest in the origin of the islanders was clear, as he continued: \u2018All of them were Cafferies \u2026 it is not to be doubted by they are a race of people, very distinct from those of the adjacent countrys.\u2019xii  The British colonized the Andamans for the first time in September 1789, establishing a settlement on Chatham Island in Port Cornwallis (now Port Blair). Lieutenant R. H. Colebrooke, sent to survey the Islands with Lieutenant Archibald Blair during 1789-90, claimed the islanders as \u2018a race of men the least civilized, \n 8 \nperhaps, in the world; being nearer to a state of nature than any people we read of.\u2019 Unlike Ritchie, he faced showers of arrows and despite his best efforts was unable to seize a single man or woman. This perhaps explains his description of the Andamanese as \u2018cunning, crafty and revengeful\u2019, at times threatening and at others \u2018docile, with the most insidious intent\u2019. He wrote:  They will affect to enter into a friendly conference, when, after receiving with a show of humility whatever articles may be presented to them, they set up a shout, and discharge their arrows at the donors. On the appearance of a vessel or boat, they frequently lie in ambush among the trees, and send one of their gang, who is generally the oldest among them, to the water\u2019s edge, to endeavour by friendly signs to allure the strangers on shore. Should the crew venture to land without arms, they instantly rush out from their lurking places, and attack them.  \u2018Like brutes,\u2019 he went on, \u2018their whole time is spent in search of food.\u2019 And: \u2018In the morning they rub their skins with mud, and wallow in it like buffaloes \u2026 Their dwellings are the most wretched hovels imaginable.\u2019 Such descriptions might be incorporated within colonial discourses about uncivilized indigenes more generally. Colebrooke surmised: \u2018The ferocious natives of New Zealand, or the shivering half-animated savages of Terra del Fuego, are in a relative state of refinement, compared to these islanders.\u2019xiii   In 1792, government ordered the removal of the colony across the harbour to a settlement also named Port Cornwallis, placing it under the charge of Governor Alexander Kyd. Between 1793 and 1795 the British transported about 700 Indian convicts there; accompanied by officers and guards.xiv We know relatively little about British and convict relations with the Islands\u2019 indigenous peoples during this period, except that islanders raided the colonial \n 9 \nsettlement in search of food, iron and other goods.xv Lieutenant Blair seized two islanders during one such incident in 1792 and took them to Calcutta. Governor Kyd noted their \u2018unmuscular physique\u2019, and their \u2018dark, oily-coloured Coffree\u2019 complexion. \u2018From what has been collected respecting their manners,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018they fall to be ranked amongst the lowest yet discovered on the scale of civilisation \u2013 in a word \u2013 Man in the rudest state of nature\u2019. Comparing their height to Laplanders \u2013 \u2018amongst the lowest in stature of the human race\u2019 \u2013 he made extensive notes on their height, noses, lips, hair and teeth, as well as what they ate, the tone of their voices, and their singing and dancing. Kyd concluded that despite the \u2018degrading situation\u2019 in which the kidnapped men were placed, they were \u2018remarkably cheerful\u2019. This was, he noted, \u2018widely different from the frigidity of disposition attributed to the American Indians, apparently implying a greater share of intellectual sprightliness than might be expected from a subject endowed with the obtuse and untutored organs.\u2019xvi  Lieutenant-Colonel Michael Symes, who visited the Islands in 1795, described the first capture of three Andamanese women. The women so feared sexual assault [Symes assumed] that they took it in turns to sleep. After they managed to escape, he lamented without a trace of irony: \u2018the object was to retain them by kindness, not by compulsion, an attempt that has failed on every trial.\u2019\nxviii\nxvii In a second incident, islanders killed two men who had \u2018proceeded to offer violence\u2019 against a captive woman. This violent offering almost certainly referred to the woman\u2019s rape.  I will return to the issue of sexual violence against Andamanese women in my discussion of the period following permanent colonization in 1858. For now, I would like to note that the captivities associated \n 10 \nwith British colonization of the Islands during the mid-1790s had much in common with practices in the penal colony of New South Wales a decade earlier. As Inga Clendinnen shows, British settlers there kidnapped indigenous people in the hope of learning something of aboriginal culture, and of reconciling them to colonization, against a backdrop of extreme, often sexual, violence.xix Across the Bass Straits in Van Diemen\u2019s Land, the British kidnapped aboriginal children, in part in a bid to impart religious salvation upon them, but more prosaically as unpaid workers and points of liaison between settlers and indigenous landowners. Paradoxically, as James Boyce explains, captive children often had greater mobility than British ex-convicts still under restrictions of movement.xx  In May 1796, in the face of high rates of sickness and mortality in the Andamans \u2013 described as a great embarrassment - the East India Company decided to abandon the Islands. It transferred the convicts to one of its other Indian penal settlements, on the island of Penang.\nxxiii\nxxi At this time, Governor Kyd took an Andamanese boy who he claimed he had found \u2018in the last stage of famine\u2019 back to Calcutta, where he employed him as a servant. As Symes put it, the boy was \u2018much noticed for the striking singularity of his appearance\u2019.xxii In the decades that followed British abandonment, trading vessels captured several islanders and took them to the mainland. In 1819, islanders fired on a Burmese junk anchored two miles from the shore. The crew captured a man and a boy, and took them to Penang. The man died on the way, but the boy was taken into the service of Captain Anderson of the Bengal Army. He learned Urdu and Malay, but \u2018took to drink\u2019 and died.  Another settler recalled the arrival of a family of four in Penang in the late 1830s. Only the girl survived, and when she was \n 11 \nfourteen she was put into service as ayah (nursemaid) to the head clerk of the police court. She later went to Malacca and then on to Singapore where it is said that she opened a girls\u2019 school.xxiv  In their forced voyages across the Bay of Bengal and in their employment in domestic servitude, the captivity of islanders bore more than a passing resemblance to the slave trade. These kidnaps might be seen as part of the continuum of slavery and bondage characteristic of South and Southeast Asia at the time.\nxxvii\nxxviii\nxxv Within colonial labour practices, distinctions between \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018unfreedom\u2019 were blurred, with convict transportation itself a case in point.xxvi Local polities enslaved Andaman islanders in the royal courts of India, Siam, Burma and the Malay Peninsula.  And the possibility of enslavement was of course bound up with assumptions about inferior \u2018races\u2019. After they abandoned the Islands in 1796, and in the context of ongoing global disputes about the merits of monogenesis and polygenesis, the British remained intrigued by the idea that islanders could provide clues to the origins of humankind, shared or otherwise. In 1819, a man called William Jack wrote of the Bishop of Calcutta\u2019s interest in two Andamanese men living in Penang: \u2018certainly there could not well be conceived a greater contrast than was exhibited between the portly form of the Bishop himself, and the two poor wretches he was examining. I should have liked to have asked him whether he really believed himself to have sprung from the same common stock with them; and whether Adam resembled these Aborigines.\u2019   \nConvicts, kidnaps and confinement: 1858-64 \n 12 \nMost famous of all the Andaman captures in the run-up to Britain\u2019s permanent colonization in 1858 was the kidnap of an islander by the survey party sent to choose the best site for a penal colony for mutineers and rebels convicted in the aftermath of the 1857 Indian Revolt. The British had been interested in re-colonizing the Andamans for some years previously, after a series of indigenous attacks on distressed vessels.xxix\n \n Henry Hopkinson, commissioner of Burma, wrote in 1856: \nLooking on the map at the magnificent situation of these islands, their proximity to such seats of trade as Madras, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Moulmein, Penang, and Singapore, considering their extent \u2026 their many fine harbours, and the prospect \u2026 of the abundant fertility of their soil, it does seem astonishing that \u2026 instead of offering a refuge to the miserable storm-driven vessel, they should be a snare in her path leading to utter destruction, and in place of engaging the enterprise, and furnishing subsistence to thousands of industrious colonists, they should be left in the possession of a handful of degenerate negroes, degraded in habits and intelligence to a level little above the beasts of the forest with which they dwell.xxx  But it was 1857 that provided the catalyst to colonization, after the widespread destruction of British-built jails and the closure of India\u2019s Southeast Asian penal settlements to new transportation convicts left the government without a place for the safe incarceration of mutineers and rebels. Within the context of the immediate penal crisis, however, Britain\u2019s desire to \u2018pacify\u2019 the Islands\u2019 indigenous peoples was important. Later on in the nineteenth century, the British officer in charge of islanders, M. V. Portman, reminded his readers: \u2018Long before the Mutiny the conduct of the Andamanese had made it imperative that the Islands should be occupied, and friendly relations established with the Aborigines\u2019.xxxi Portman\u2019s use of the language of occupation is an important reminder of the underlying violence of the colonial settlement of the Islands. It \n 13 \nalso speaks to assumptions that in the mid-nineteenth century \u2018friendship\u2019 with islanders was both possible and desirable.  The head of the 1857 survey party, F. J. Mouat, wrote a detailed description of his visit to the Andamans, and his account and its associated illustrations were reproduced, summarized and reviewed in a range of contemporary publications.xxxii\nxxxiii\nxxxiv\n The party dragged a man on board ship, called him \u2018Andamans John\u2019 or \u2018Jack\u2019 (we do not know his real name), and took him to Calcutta where he was photographed and presented to Governor-General and Lady Canning. In a letter to Queen Victoria, Lady Canning wrote that he was \u2018gentle and tractable and imitates everything and is amused at everything from a glass of water upwards\u2019.  The British kidnapped \u2018Jack\u2019 in order to gather information about islanders, and as a conduit for knowledge of the supposed benefits of colonial \u2018civilization\u2019. However, he fell ill, and so they returned him to the Islands to an uncertain fate. The widespread visual reproduction of engravings taken from contemporary photographs in popular publications in Britain, notably Mouat\u2019s published account but also the Illustrated London News, is the reason for which he is so well known (figure 2). Vishavjit Pandya describes \u2018Jack\u2019s kidnap as a contact event that became a \u2018sign\u2019 of colonial expansion, seen by a public familiar with viewing single native bodies as representations of whole cultures.   The survey party \u2018captured\u2019 the Andamanese in other ways too, raiding their settlements and taking bows, arrows, nets and other implements. Images of these cultural artefacts were reproduced alongside pictures of islanders in \n 14 \ncontemporary periodicals (figure 3). Stolen goods were also displayed at colonial exhibitions in such a way as to render material culture a crucial signifier of Andamanese \u2018primitiveness\u2019.\nxxxvi\nxxxvii\nxxxviii\nxxxix\nxxxv The 1857 survey party also stole human remains. Mouat for instance presented the skeleton of a man killed by the Andamans committee to the British Museum.  Whilst kidnaps and the theft of islanders\u2019 possessions offered the lure of accessing and representing cultural practices to a metropolitan audience, the careful description and measurement of Andamanese captives were precursors to anthropometric investigations in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, when Darwinist ideas about evolution had in large part settled disputes about human origins. Colonial ethnographers like E. H. Man and M. V. Portman then used sticks, calipers and other devices to measure islanders\u2019 \u2018race\u2019. Their findings were of enormous interest to scientists well into the end of the nineteenth century.  Across the Empire, from Cape Town to Bermuda, the Caribbean and Singapore, colonial officers were similarly engaged in the anthropometric study of incarcerated or otherwise confined indigenous communities.  In the South Asian context, David Arnold has described the disciplinary and medical practices associated with hospitals, jails, asylums and lock-hospitals as the colonization of the body itself.   The British shipped the first batch of 200 mutineers and rebels to the Andamans in March 1858 under the charge of medical officer J. P. Walker. By the end of the following year, over 3,500 more convicts had been transported to the Islands.xl Ordinary offenders joined them once the 1857 crisis had passed and by 1865 the penal colony\u2019s average daily muster was almost 4,000 strong.xli There was ongoing violence between islanders and settlers. During the early months of \n 15 \ncolonization, escaped convicts usually returned to the settlement of their own accord, sick and injured, recounting tales of the deaths of their comrades at the hands of indigenous peoples. But the government of India remained keen to avoid what it called \u2018collisions\u2019, and reacted furiously to what it called \u2018unprovoked\u2019 aggression towards the Islands\u2019 indigenous inhabitants. It was especially aggrieved to learn of clashes with \u2018public functionaries\u2019, rather than convicts.\nxliii\nxlii The British hoped to keep the convicts apart from islanders \u2013 in 1858 Walker even proposed to expel them from tracts of land and to establish a military cordon  \n \n- but the idea of separating the penal colony from the Andamanese remained little more than a fantasy.  \nPortman claimed later in the 1890s that the islanders told him that they had sympathised with the convicts at the time of colonization, for they realised that they were working as forced labour, and so they had targeted authority figures. Thus convict overseers removed their special turbans, badges and belts when going out to work.xliv During one attack on a working party in 1859, islanders apparently indicated that the convicts should move away and allow them to attack their naval guard. In scenes reminiscent of those described by Clendinnen for New South Wales in Dancing With Strangers, Portman described what happened next: \u2018During the two hours they had possession of the encampment they beckoned the convicts to come and dance with them, and they, from fear, complied. Ludicrous groups of savages with a convict on each side, with arms entwined, were engaged in stamping motions which appeared intended for dancing.\u2019xlv In light of Portman\u2019s later discussions with islanders, it \n 16 \nis difficult to read this as anything other than a performance of solidarity against colonial authority.   The British were always mindful that comparisons could be drawn between the Andamans and other colonial settlements. The first government report on the penal colony, in March 1859, predicted that like \u2018miserable creatures\u2019 elsewhere, civilization would kill off the islanders:  It is not difficult to foresee that, should our occupation of the land be prolonged, and the dense jungle which now covers every spot of ground be made to yield to the axe and the ploughshare, these miserable creatures will rapidly disappear, sharing the fate of the red tribes of North America, and the less naturally gifted aborigines of Australia, and other lands where civilization has alike proved fatal to the original possessors, and the natural products of the soil.xlvi  In this context, the British remained interested in Andamanese origins too. Evidently sympathetic to polygenesis, the commissioner of Tenasserim Albert Fytche drew attention to the Andamanese as the remnants of \u2018a race formerly very extensively diffused over South eastern Asia and its Archipelago, which, for the most part, has been extirpated by races more advanced towards civilization, being now driven to remote islands, or mountain fastnesses, such as the Andamans\u2019. He associated the issue of blankets to Tasmanian aborigines and New Zealanders with their death in large numbers from pulmonary diseases, and predicted the same fate for the Andamanese.xlvii These were allusions to what we now understand as the dramatic demographic consequences of land clearance, population movement, and exposure to previously unknown diseases like smallpox and syphilis. But at the time, they seemed to confirm ideas around multiple human origins. Across Empire, the British appropriated the bodies of \n 17 \nthose who died, dissecting human remains in their physiological investigations into the \u2018races of mankind\u2019.xlviii Portman went as far as to write: \u2018we have reason to think that the race who inhabited New Zealand before the advent of the Maoris were Negritos allied to the Tasmanians and Andamanese.\u2019xlix  In an attempt to prevent further violence between islanders and the settlement, when J. C. Haughton replaced Walker as superintendent in 1859 he banned visits to places the Andamanese were known to frequent and suspended further exploration into the interior.l However, despite this injunction by early 1860 a few friendly contact missions had been made. Convicts and brigadesmen exchanged bottles, nails, shirts, belts, neckerchiefs, and turbans for necklaces and belts \u2018made of grass and twine\u2019.li The most extended early encounter took place in mid-1860, under the direction of head convict overseer Khoosheee Lall. It lasted for two and a half hours in full view of \u2018a great crowd of convicts\u2019 on Viper Island. Lall described how a man had taken hold of his clothing, and with the word \u2018kuprah\u2019 indicated both his knowledge of Hindustani and his desire for the item. Lall explained that he had taken some cloth from his convict orderly Buckorie Sing, whilst another convict Rughmundur Sing used it to dress the man and his male companions in pugris (turbans), dhotis (cloth wrapped around the waist and legs), and mirzais (jackets). They resembled Madrasis, Lall reported, and \u2018appeared quite delighted.\u2019 They then exchanged sweetmeats, a melon, bead necklaces, and leg irons for Andamanese necklaces, belts, and armlets.lii  Despite what was presented as successful (i.e. non-violent) contact, coupled with British occupation and clearance of Andamanese territory was a \n 18 \nfundamental incompatibility between the desire of both Andamanese and settlers to appropriate and to protect property. The Andamanese wanted food, working implements, cloth, and iron, and the British desired bows, arrows, and jewellery. As Portman put it later on, the Andamanese objected to \u2018strangers coming to their villages and taking away their property \u2026 such conduct on our part could only provoke ill-feeling and hostility on theirs.\u2019liii By the end of 1860, relations had soured considerably, and the Andamanese killed a naval brigadesman and made raids on convict working parties, taking plantains, tools, identificatory neck tickets, and Brahminical threads, amongst other goods. In retaliation, the settlers captured six Andamanese men, handcuffing them, tying their arms behind their backs, and putting them under guard in the naval barracks. Haughton reported that in the face of their \u2018natural effort to regain liberty\u2019 they were \u2018as slippery as eels\u2019.liv   This kidnap reinvigorated practices of capturing and confining the Andamanese. Naval brigadesmen became trackers, guards and even collectors and producers of colonial knowledge. At the turn of 1860\/61, brigadesmen were placed in charge of three of the captives, with the brief of learning something of their cultural practices. Explicitly drawing on Daniel Defoe\u2019s vision of a cannibal island, they named them \u2018Punch\u2019, \u2018Friday\u2019, and \u2018Crusoe Blair\u2019 (after the lieutenant), for there was an extraordinary belief at the time that they had \u2018no \nproper names for each other\u2019.lv The brigadesmen took the three men to superintendent Haughton\u2019s house, where Lieutenant Hellard of the naval brigade noted \u2018they were very much taken up with little Harry H \u2013\u2019, likely the superintendent\u2019s son. They dressed them in naval uniforms, with the words \u2018I.N. \n 19 \nBrigade\u2019 on the ribbons of their straw hats, and tied them up.\nlviii\nlvi One of the men, \u2018Punch\u2019, managed to bite through his rope and escape. \u2018Friday\u2019 and \u2018Crusoe\u2019 also bolted, but were quickly recaptured and fettered. I doubt they found much comfort in Hellard\u2019s note that the irons were only \u2018slight\u2019.lvii \u2018Irons are not at all pleasant,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018within a few days they are very anxious to have them taken off, and towards dark, they pretend to have pains in their limbs.\u2019 However, given the likelihood of escape, he would not allow it.    Three more Andamanese were kidnapped a few days later, though Hellard noted that the two sets of captives were from different communities, for \u2018they did not show any sign of pleasure at seeing them.\u2019lix Finding that \u2018nothing further was to be gained\u2019 from any of them, Haughton decided to let the first captives \u2013 \u2018Punch\u2019, \u2018Friday\u2019, and \u2018Crusoe Blair\u2019 - go. Notes on their confinement incorporate fascinating details: what they ate; how they cooked; medical practices; their love of children and animals, singing, and dancing; and, their astonishment at mirrors. But settlement officials and brigadesmen failed to learn more than a few words of their language, or to find out anything about their spiritual or religious beliefs. Haughton noted that upon their release they showed a great deal of affection for their sailor guards, and that they had tried to encourage him to accompany them into the jungle.lx His is the first of many references to the growth of warm personal ties between the naval brigade and the Andamanese. Haughton\u2019s replacement, superintendent R. C. Tytler, noted also the affection the Andamanese had for brigadesmen and petty officers. One man who had lost a leg was delighted with a crutch made for him by the sailors. Later on, islanders slept in the settlement boats.lxi In the absence of indigenous \n 20 \nperspective, we should be wary of reading intimacy into coping strategies in the face of domination. Indeed, Hellard noted that when left alone in the naval barracks, the men \u2018became frightened, and clung to the men in charge, and begged them not to let them go\u2019.\nlxiii\nlxii Moreover, supposedly \u2018friendly\u2019 contact was frequently underpinned by violence. Brigadesmen knocked \u2018Crusoe\u2019s teeth out on the way to Moulmein, as punishment for some supposed misdemeanour, and beat islanders at other times.    The fate of the three other captives \u2013 named similarly \u2018Port Blair\u2019, \u2018Crusoe\u2019, and \u2018Jumbo\u2019lxiv - was quite different, for the British viewed them not as a potential source of cultural knowledge but as a means of communicating supposed colonial superiority to their fellow islanders. With this in view, government shipped the men to Rangoon with the aim of communicating to them \u2018some idea of the power and resources of their captors\u2019.lxv They were keen to learn their language, and on arrival the men were kept in the jail yard under the charge of an English sailor, who took them out on daily walks. No progress was made, however, and so the British sent them on to Moulmein. Thinking that they were being taken back to Port Blair, the men were apparently \u2018disappointed\u2019 when taken ashore. \u2018Jumbo\u2019 fell sick, and the others became homesick and \u2018pining\u2019. An escape attempt failed after local villagers captured them, and shortly afterwards \u2018Jumbo\u2019 died. The surviving men were photographed (figure 4).lxvi A little progress was made with learning vocabulary, and the men learned how to sew and use scissors, to sit to table, to use cutlery, and to bathe with soap. But in general terms the British viewed the kidnap as unsuccessful and so returned \n 21 \n\u2018Port Blair\u2019 and \u2018Crusoe\u2019 to the Andamans. The Deputy Commissioner of Amherst, S. R. Tickell, who had taken charge of them, wrote in 1863:  The experiment of civilizing these two, by weaning them from their wild habits and creating artificial wants, to supply which should involve the necessity of frequent visits to the settlement, and thus form as it were the nucleus of increasing intercourse with a superior race, has certainly so far failed.lxvii  Three decades later, Portman disagreed. He wrote that it was a turning point: from what the men had told their fellow islanders at the time, they had realised the nature and extent of British dominance in the region and the limits of their continued resistance.lxviii Indeed, it was said that after their return to the islands the men had behaved well.lxix\n \n \nAt the beginning of 1863, the British began actively to encourage naval brigade visits to Andamanese settlements. Petty officer of the naval brigade Harry Smith led a series of exchanges of biscuits, bread, plantains and other small items for islanders\u2019 bows and arrows, bringing them to the settlement headquarters at Ross Island.\nlxxii\nlxx Superintendent Tytler wrote: \u2018I have no doubt that the time has now arrived when we may reasonably hope to reclaim and civilize these children of Nature.\u2019lxxi He expressed a wish to use Smith and his brigadesmen to accomplish this aim.   Permeating all contact missions was the underlying threat of capture and confinement. In his account of the \u2018friendly intercourse\u2019 of early 1863, for instance, superintendent Tytler wrote of how a \u2018boy and a man went over to Ross Island\u2019. In contrast, a naval brigadesman stationed on the Islands at the time, \n 22 \nEdwin Forbes, described in a letter home the same journey as a \u2018seizure\u2019 or \u2018kidnap\u2019, transforming it discursively into a quite different sort of event.lxxiii\nlxxiv\nlxxvi\n And the purpose of kidnaps at this time was both to create cultural go-betweens and to \u2018civilize\u2019 islanders. The brigadesmen carefully dressed the Andamanese up, especially the women whose near-nudity appeared indecent to them. The captive man known as \u2018Jack\u2019 was put in naval uniform during his journey to Calcutta in 1858;  \u2018Punch\u2019, \u2018Friday\u2019, and \u2018Crusoe Blair\u2019 were given straw hats during their confinement; and the islanders captured and sent to Rangoon in 1861 were dressed in \u2018slops and jumpers of white duck, and straw hats, bound with broad black ribbon, bearing the ship\u2019s name to which their former guardian had belonged.\u2019lxxv Such clothing transformed islanders from \u2018children of nature\u2019 to \u2018colonized subjects\u2019. This transformation was represented visually in a range of contemporary photographs and engravings, most notably the 1858 image reproduced in Mouat\u2019s Adventures and Researchers (figure 2), which was reproduced widely in contemporary periodicals like the Illustrated London \nNews.   For their part, the convicts appear to have been simultaneously afraid and disdainful of the Andamanese. In the face of a series of violent raids on convict working parties, Tytler wrote of the convicts\u2019 constant dread of attack: \u2018even the utterance of the word Coffree or Junglee admees nearly paralyzes them\u2019. He feared for the viability of new colonial outposts at the sites of Aberdeen and Haddo in the face of the prospect of mass desertion by the intimidated convicts.lxxvii And yet convicts seem also to have dismissed Andamanese prospects, and in this sense shared official views about their inevitable demise. \n 23 \nOne government report claimed that the convicts looked on them as \u2018vermin to be extirpated\u2019.lxxviii\nlxxix\n According to the superintendent of Allahabad central jail, writing in 1859, three convicts pardoned and returned to India told him of \u2018strong black cannibals with horse-shaped faces\u2019. They claimed that they would be cleared away with the jungle.  The Andamanese mocked the convicts, mimicking with what one official described as \u2018painful and cruel accuracy their affrighted and deprecating gestures\u2019, as they implored: \u2018Ram, Ram\u2019.lxxx  The Andamanese view of the convicts perhaps expresses something of the ambivalence of colonization through penal transportation, for convicts were simultaneously both a crucial part of the occupying force and under sentences of forced labour - or to put in another way both colonizers and colonized. One archival fragment that speaks to this point is the writing of convict Munir Shikohabadi, who penned a lengthy poem at about this time. His verse includes the couplet: \u2018Blackness belongs to the jungle people, whiteness to the Europeans \/ The prisoners on this island are caught day and night in two-colouredness\u2019. In the original Persian, \u2018two-colouredness\u2019 invokes a sense of \u2018double-dealing\u2019, which captures neatly the nature of this peculiar colonial dilemma.lxxxi\nlxxxii\nlxxxiii\n But as we have seen there were significant lines of rupture between islanders and settlers. Islanders even learned some Urdu, which was the lingua franca of officials and convicts. They knew how to ask for kaprah (cloth) and water (\u2018panno\u2019 [pani]).  One Eurasian convict, James David, went as far as to state in 1863 \u2018the Andamanese were kind to me and kissed and called me \u201cUbba\u201d [father]\u2019.   \nTowards a gendered reading of colonization and captivity \n 24 \nThere is also the question of intimate relations in an almost exclusively male penal colony. We know almost nothing about personal relationships between convicts during the early colonial period - beyond the worries of British officials about the prevalence of \u2018unnatural crime\u2019 within an exclusively male penal colony. Both Mouat and the first government inspector of the Andamans, surgeon G. G. Brown, expressed fears that the Andamans would descend into the moral chaos of the notorious Australian penal colony at Norfolk Island. Mouat wrote that, without women, the Islands would become a \u2018pandemonium of the worst description\u2019.lxxxiv\nlxxxv\n In 1858, the government of India ordered that although no immediate measures were necessary, in order to address the gender imbalance of the incipient colony, a system of convict family migration should eventually be worked out according to \u2018judgment and experience\u2019.  \n \nIn the absence of a free settlement, unlike in the whaling stations of early colonial Tasmania or the fur trade in colonial Canada, there was no need to use intimate relations as means of breaking into trading networks. On the contrary, the British strongly discouraged all communities from sexual relations with the Andamanese, fearing the exacerbation of hostilities.  \nAnd yet there is no question that there was sexual contact between islanders and settlers during the early years of colonization. An early allusion to relations might be read into a slightly ambiguous statement about the naval brigade\u2019s contact with islanders in 1863, when it was said that one evening \u2018friendly intercourse was in every sense of the word finally established.\u2019lxxxvi Whether this was the case or not that night, within the first ten years of colonization Andamanese women were giving birth to children fathered by \n 25 \nsettlers, though the archives are silent on whether they were convicts, naval brigadesmen or British officials. One rare exception is the escaped mutineer Dudhnath Tiwari, who lived with islanders for some months, and left an Andamanese woman pregnant when he fled to warn of an attack on the colonial settlement in 1858.lxxxvii\nlxxxviii\nlxxxix\n Violence always underlay sexual intercourse between settlers and islanders, whether through coitus as an act metaphorically representative of colonial invasion and occupation of the Andamans, more literally during sexual assault, or through the spread and effects of venereal disease. Certainly, by the second half of the 1860s there was a high rate of stillbirth, likely caused by maternal syphilis. At the time officials made epidemiological associations between islander \u2013 settler sexual relations, venereal disease, and infant mortality.  One British officer even went as far as to suggest an institutionalised programme of \u2018new blood put in them by marriage to Natives of other countries, such as Africans.\u2019 Superintendent B. Ford barely drew breath before rejecting the idea out of hand.   A turning point in the history of the settlement revolved around an attempted rape that led to the death of a naval brigadesman called James Pratt at the hands of two islanders. On 28 January 1863, P. W. Fendall, commander of the Andamans detachment, reported that it has been an entirely unprovoked attack.xc Clendinnen has noted official bemusement at the supposedly unpredictable response of native peoples to the settlement of New South Wales, as Aborigines seemed to waver between friendliness and open hostility.xci After Pratt\u2019s death, one government of India official compared the Andamans to Australia in this respect, writing: \u2018The same series of events has presented itself \n 26 \nover and over again with the Australian aborigines \u2013 friendly intercourse, excessive confidence on the part of the European, then unexplained treachery from the Natives.\u2019 In the Andamans, officials explained islander violence through reference to the scale of civilization: \u2018with races of such low organization, there is never any security against sudden outbreaks of rage or cupidity in individuals.\u2019\nxciii\nxcii Tytler subsequently described his \u2018children of nature\u2019 as \u2018treacherous, blood-thirsty, and murderous\u2019. \u2018We have no reason to look on them as a poor miserable, savage, ignorant[,] helpless race\u2019 he wrote. \u2018They are not so, and have proved themselves not to be so. They are treacherous where no cause for treachery exists. They are blood-thirsty, subtle murderers, possessing all the facilities, understanding and senses common to other men, but destroying life under the garb of friendship when the opportunity offers.\u2019   But we might look beyond discourses of race and make sense of islanders\u2019 apparently unpredictable behaviour if we consider it as a quite coherent response to the violence and sexual exploitation that was rarely acknowledged by officials. The brigade captured two islanders allegedly involved in the incident \u2013 they called them \u2018Jumbo\u2019 (later identified by Portman as Tura) and \u2018Snowball\u2019 (Lokala)xciv - and placed them in irons.xcv Tytler wrote at the time of the need to take \u2018compulsory measures\u2019 to put them to work at land clearance. \u2018By this means alone will this savage tribe be reclaimed to civilization\u2019, he went on, \u2018and no other conciliatory means with them can ever be of avail\u2019.xcvi However, events were more complicated than they first appeared, for after receiving what he described as \u2018hints quite accidentally\u2019, when Tytler made further enquiries in the naval barracks a few weeks afterwards, it emerged that Pratt had attempted to \n 27 \nrape one of the women, \u2018Madam Cooper\u2019. Her \u2018husband\u2019 had killed Pratt as a result. Some of the sailors claimed that there had been no previous \u2018connection\u2019 with the women; others maintained that they had gone frequently into the woods with the unattached women - at the instigation of Andamanese men. All were agreed that the women were \u2018decent\u2019 and did not encourage the men sexually. The problem with Pratt had emerged, they alleged, because \u2018Madam Cooper\u2019 was the man they knew as \u2018Jumbo\u2019 (Tura)\u2019s wife. As Tytler put it, this altered significantly events, and placed the conduct of the Andamanese \u2018in a different light to that formerly shewn.\u2019 Petty officer Smith left the Islands shortly afterwards, presumably in disgrace, though there is no record of his official admonishment.xcvii    By the time knowledge of the attempted rape came to light, Pratt\u2019s death had provoked a fundamental shift in local policy. Tytler had already ordered \u2018Jumbo\u2019 (Tura) and \u2018Snowball\u2019 (Lokala) into custody on Ross Island, and induced (by what means we do not know) the woman known as \u2018Madam Cooper\u2019 (by now known as \u2018Topsy\u2019) and a boy known as \u2018Sambo\u2019, \u2018Snowball\u2019 (Lokala)\u2019s brother, to join them. Tytler built them a house, and employed convicts under his personal supervision \u2018to wait upon them and attend to their wants like servants.\u2019 He placed in charge the recently ordained Calcutta-born and British-educated Reverend Henry Corbyn. This arrangement formed the basis of a long-term institution for the Andamanese, which islanders called the Boudla[h],xcviii and the British called the Andaman home.xcix They were removed from the watchful eyes of sailors, and placed under the charge of convicts. Brigadesman Edwin Forbes \n 28 \nwrote of the change: \u2018the Andamans hate the sight of a Coolie and would cut their throats as quick as they would look at them\u2019.c  \nInstitutionalised captivity in the Andaman home The Andaman home was an institution of detention that aimed to \u2018improve\u2019 islanders, forcing them into productive labour through creating dependency on addictive consumables such as tobacco and rum. In effect, it extended and institutionalised earlier practices of kidnap and capture. However, it also replicated significant elements of the management of convicts in the Andamans penal colony. Islanders were placed in confinement, fettered, handcuffed, photographed, flogged, beaten, and guarded, mirroring substantively the treatment of Indian convicts. They even faced the prospect of banishment overseas. \u2018Jumbo\u2019 (Tura) for instance spent six months in irons in Moulmein in punishment for brigadesman Pratt\u2019s death. The same sanction was held out to islanders involved in violent incidents later on.ci In 1863, Tytler went as far as to suggest that the islanders should be rounded up and sent en masse to the nearby Cocos Islands and forced to clear and cultivate land and, thus, to \u2018learn civilization\u2019. There was some precedent for his idea in colonial Van Diemen\u2019s Land, where government had instituted a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing during the 1830s. The government rounded up Tasmanian aborigines by force or by trickery and deported them to Flinders Island in the Bass Straits.cii The government of India, however, was far from enthusiastic about his idea, though it continued to support the taking of Andamanese to the mainland.ciii  \n 29 \nIn 1863, Corbyn took one group of eight islanders to Calcutta in order that they might \u2018describe to their people, on their return, the superior advantages of a civilized life.\u2019civ The British hoped to impress them with the city\u2019s rail yards, cantonments and pig farms.cv During the trip, two of the party drowned, one was murdered, and one died of \u2018natural causes\u2019. Back in the Andamans three years later, one of the returned men murdered another.cvi During the second half of the 1860s, the British continued to take islanders to India. Officer in charge of the Andamanese J. N. Homfray\u2019s group was even photographed with a group of seven men and women in Calcutta in October 1865 (figure 5). Homfray claimed that when the party left, the islanders had cried (\u2018and were very sorry in my leaving them\u2019), but when it returned, they were so pleased to see him that they danced and sang all night (\u2018rejoicing at the accounts of treatment their friends had received at the hands of myself and others.\u2019)cvii\n \n  \nJust as the islanders violently opposed colonial settlement, it would be a mistake to ignore their challenge to internment in the Home. In 1863 Corbyn wrote of the indiscipline of the \u2018insane frolic\u2019 that \u2018almost\u2019 baffled his efforts \u2018to civilize and instruct\u2019 the Andamanese men, women and children under his charge:   The boy would rush off to one end of the room and dance and shout defiance. Madam Cooper would fling herself into an easy-chair \u2026 Another would run to the door and call for Judder (cocoanuts) and Panoo (water) \u2026 or a light for a cigar \u2026 or else seize something on the table and set the rest into screams of laughter ... Joe, who is a very dodging and deceptive man, but extremely playful, almost always laughing and in high spirits, would try every artifice to escape the mat-work \u2026 Jacko shewed a more pugnacious spirit, and was inclined to resist with force till he found such resistance unavailing. The same opposition was encountered in teaching Topsy and Bess sewing.cviii \n 30 \n Corbyn wrote of using physical force against islanders, striking them with his hands or cane, though the Andamanese were no passive subjects. When he slapped them, they slapped him back, with \u2018jocular or abusive remarks, which provoked roars of laughter from the rest at my expense\u2019. His attempts to hold the head of one boy over his book to force repetition of the alphabet was met with a bodkin pointed at his eyes, \u2018with a sign that he would pierce them with it unless I gave up that obnoxious mode of teaching him.\u2019 And yet, Corbyn claimed that the Andamanese were deeply affectionate: \u2018I am almost crushed by the weight of their embraces\u2019.cix One mainland contemporary wrote with incredulity of Corbyn\u2019s contradictory account, denouncing his descriptions of dancing and physical intimacy with \u2018savages\u2019 a \u2018ludicrous hoax\u2019. It revealed, he noted, \u2018Muscular Christianity reduced to an absurdity.\u2019cx The following year there was a mass \u2018escape\u2019 (and subsequent \u2018arrests\u2019), when prompted by convict violence, all the islanders then on Ross swam to South Andaman.cxi  The Andamanese also mounted attacks on convicts associated with the Andaman home. \u2018I always thought that it was a good thing to have Church and a minister of the Gospil [sic] at hand\u2019, naval brigadesman Forbes wrote in 1864, \u2018but this place was bad enough without [Corbyn] now it is ten times worse.\u2019cxii The home itself became a strange spectacle \u2013 a space of Andamanese experimental captivity within a place of Indian convict colonization \u2013 and as such drew what Corbyn described as \u2018crowds of Europeans and natives\u2019 who expressed \u2018unaffected astonishment\u2019 at the islanders. \u2018People flocked to visit them,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018as they would visit wild beasts in a Menagerie\u2019. For their part, \n 31 \nthe islanders seem to have enjoyed playing on this reaction; performing \u2018various antics to elicit mirth and gifts\u2019, scattering \u2018frightened Natives\u2019 left and right, making \u2018wild sonorous war shouts\u2019 to terrify their \u2018gaping spectators\u2019, and \u2018bursting with laughter\u2019 as they turned their audience into dancing performers.cxiii   Corbyn sought to \u2018educate\u2019 islanders in other ways too. After islanders shot arrows at two escaped convicts, he found \u2018but one way\u2019 of explaining that future attacks would be met with summary retribution. He brought four men \u2013 \u2018Jumbo\u2019, \u2018Topsy\u2019, \u2018Joe\u2019, and \u2018Jacko\u2019 - before one of the wounded men, pointing to his injuries and acting out their affliction with a bow and arrow. He gestured toward their camp and used some \u2018disconnected words of their language\u2019 to explain that their tribe had been to blame. He then pointed a pistol at each of the men in turn. Clearly terrified, they shook with fear. Tytler recalled how \u2018Topsy\u2019 had made \u2018frantic gestures\u2019, pointing southward at another tribe, and pointing to Jumbo\u2019s fetters indicated that she would go and find the responsible man so that he too could be put in chains. Corbyn took the men on to see the second wounded convict in hospital, by which time Jumbo was so afraid that he could hardly stand. \u2018I felt that it was better to cause momentary terror \u2026 than any longer to allow the lives of unoffending persons to be exposed to their cruel caprices and brutal love of butchery\u2019, he wrote, claiming that it resulted in an improvement in the islanders\u2019 willingness to assist the settlement.cxiv The inhumanity of this frightening encounter hardly bears further elaboration. Tytler, meanwhile, was firm in his belief that the Andamanese needed to be \n 32 \ntaught that they were British subjects, and so were under \u2018bounden duty\u2019 of obedience.cxv  As the British had hoped, islanders came to depend upon the Andaman home for food, tobacco and other supplies, to the point that officials even began to use strategies of exile from Ross to punish misdemeanours.\ncxvii\ncxviii\ncxvi Indeed, despite Corbyn\u2019s somewhat defensive claim that the Andamanese stayed willingly at the home, their residence there was at best the result of the creation of a relationship of dependence on food and narcotics, and at worst an expression of what Portman described later in the 1890s as \u2018considerable and illegal pressure\u2019.  As early as 1858, the head of the Andamans committee, F. J. Mouat, drew out something of the complexities of attempts to draw distinctions between incarceration, kidnap and captivity. He argued that, as law and order were entirely absent from Andamanese society, islanders did not know right from wrong and thus they were as morally irresponsible for their acts as were lunatics. Mouat thought that it was unlikely that \u2018natives\u2019 would ever understand fully the penal intent of incarceration, and doubted that the Andamanese themselves differentiated it from kidnapping.  \n \nMouat\u2019s words are strongly suggestive of the overlaps in islanders\u2019 understanding of \u2018capture\u2019 and \u2018penal incarceration\u2019, as well as more profoundly the inherent ambiguities of drawing clear lines of distinctions between them.  \nConclusions Kidnap and captivity were a necessary precondition for Britain\u2019s more extensive, permanent colonization of the Andamans during the late eighteenth and \n 33 \nnineteenth centuries, for they enabled close observation of the Islands\u2019 indigenous peoples. At the time, islanders formed part of larger imperial discussions about \u2018race\u2019, with officials drawing on ideas and representations from across the globe. After colonization, captive islanders held out hopes for the creation of cultural interlocutors, who could educate their fellow islanders about British superiority and \u2018civilization\u2019 and so persuade them of the benefits of settlement. As a British penal colony for Indian convicts, there were a variety of relationships at work within indigenous \u2013 settler contact more broadly. Convicts shared colonial understandings of Andaman islanders, and became incorporated into both contact missions and practices of indigenous confinement. But there is also evidence that islanders drew their own distinctions between the settlers. Certainly, no simple lines between \u2018colonizer\u2019 and \u2018colonized\u2019 can be drawn. There are interesting parallels in this respect with the convict settlements of New South Wales and Van Diemen\u2019s Land, where the heightened significance of relationships of confinement \u2013 and resistance against them - shaped and gendered relationships in significant ways. Colonial officers in the Andamans were strongly aware of these comparisons, which drew a supposedly isolated penal colony into the networks of Empire. In this respect the Islands might be seen as part of a single frame of reference for colonial indigenes.cxix\n \n But within the significant overlaps between the treatment and experiences of convicts and islanders, we glimpse something of the ambiguities of penal colonization too. \nAcknowledgements This article was completed as part of the ESRC project \u2018Integrated Histories of the Andaman Islands\u2019 (award no.
