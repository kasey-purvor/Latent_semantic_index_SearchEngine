Briefly, fluorochrome\nexcitation with TPE is restricted to the objective lens focal volume, obviating the need for a\nconfocal aperture required by CLSM to filter \u2018out-of-focus\u2019 background light. In the absence\nof background light being generated, the emission light is permitted to bypass the confocal de-\nscanned detection pathway. A properly implemented non-descanned detection (NDD) design\ncan therefore improve system detection sensitivity. Increased sensitivity, together with reduced\nscattering and absorption of the longer wavelength excitation beam should also result in\nimproved imaging deeper into tissue (3,4). The localized excitation volume and increased\nsensitivity may reduce photo-bleaching and photo-damage, with improvements expected in\ncell viability. The main drawback is the cost, specifically that of a pulsed (mode-locked) near-\ninfra red (NIR) laser (\u223c\u00a3100,000), needed to provide a light source intense enough for adequate\nTPE events for image times of \u223c1s.\nData that compare TPE with OPE show advantages, but these studies have examined the effect\nof limited excitation wavelengths. In a classic study (2), 1047nm was employed for the long-\nterm imaging of developing hamster embryos. TPE imaging for 24hrs did not inhibit cell\ndivision. Indeed the near infra-red (NIR) laser-exposed embryo subsequently implanted into a\nrecipient female, resulted in a successful birth (2). This was in contrast to 8hrs of visible laser\nconfocal imaging of unstained embryos which inhibited cell division and arrested subsequent\nembryo development. Similarly, an improvement in cell viability with 710nm TPE was also\nshown when compared to 352nm confocal imaging (5). For imaging depth comparisons, a\n1047nm laser was used to demonstrate a doubling of imaging depth with TPE compared to\n488nm confocal imaging (3). TPE advantages over OPE were not obvious without minimising\nthe NIR exposure and optimizing NDD system sensitivity (6).\nConventional OPE CLSM has long helped researchers to study cells within connective tissues\n(see (11)). These tissues are ideally suited for cell visualization, as cell density is relatively low\nand the cells are clearly visible against the extra-cellular matrix (14-16) which shows little\nauto-fluorescence at low laser powers. The proposed advantages of TPE over OPE CLSM\nshould allow deeper imaging into the tissue, whilst retaining cell viability. Chondrocytes\ncomprise \u223c5% of articular cartilage (17) but are wholly responsible for extra-cellular matrix\nturnover. Relatively little is known of in situ chondrocyte physiology in either healthy or\ndegenerate cartilage, but the volume, morphology and volume regulation of a subset of these\ncells (18,19) may play a role in the initiation \/ progression of osteoarthritis. Although it is\ntempting to study the physiology of chondrocytes isolated from their native extra-cellular\nmatrix, this exposes them to changes in e.g. ion concentrations and osmolarity, consequently\naltering chondrocyte behaviour (15). The advent of CLSM allowed researchers to study these\ncells in situ with obvious advantages for understanding their physiology. However the rate of\nintracellular fluorophore bleaching and sensitivity of the cells after repeated exposure to OPE\nlimited the period of visualization possible. TPE laser scanning microscopy should improve\nthe time course during which the cells can be safely studied, and the ability to image\nchondrocytes deeper within the tissue, removed from possible artifacts at cut surfaces (20).\nInitial two-photon laser scanning microscopy work in our laboratory proved promising, but it\nsoon became clear the advantages associated with this technique were subtle and dependent\nupon the TPE wavelength used.\nA number of studies address the effect of TPE on cellular viability and the importance of\nexcitation wavelength (21). However to our knowledge, no quantitative study has been\nperformed comparing the properties of OPE vs TPE over the tunable range (720-980nm) of\ncommonly-used near infra-red (NIR) pulsed lasers attached to commercially-available two-\nphoton laser scanning microscopy systems using standard visible wavelength excited\nfluorophores. For instance, the hamster embryo survival study (2) used 1047nm TPE excitation,\nBush et al. Page 2\nFront Biosci.

Additionally, reports highlighting\nTPE microscopy improvements in sensitivity and depth of imaging have used systems equipped\nwith non-standard detection systems (3,22). In the present report, we investigated the\nwavelength dependence of two-photon laser scanning microscopy to determine the advantages\nrelative to single (i.e. OPE) 488nm CLSM for our Zeiss 510NLO (non-linear optics) system.\nUsing intracellular calcein as the fluorophore, we compared cell viability, fluorophore photo-\nbleaching, and image contrast with image depth. The results showed that both non-de-scanned\ndetection (NDD) and non-NDD TPE offered some advantages compared to confocal imaging,\nas demonstrated by tracking volume changes of in situ chondrocytes in response to a hypo-\nosmotic challenge, and their subsequent regulatory volume decrease (RVD). We also\nhighlighted problems associated with TPE, and the importance of choosing an optimum TPE\nwavelength for a particular application and instrument. The imaging benefits of TPE exhibit\nclear wavelength dependence, and in some cases TPE proved detrimental to live cell imaging.\nHence, for a specific application that would theoretically appear to favour two-photon laser\nscanning microscopy, careful consideration and examination of the apparent advantages need\nto be assessed when using standard commercial CLSM systems.\n3. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n3.1 Biochemicals and solutions\nCalcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) were obtained from Cambridge Bioscience,\nCambridge, U.K. and stock solutions of each made to 1mM with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)\nor water respectively. The standard tissue culture medium was serum- and phenol red-free\nDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium buffered with (N-[2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N\u2019-[2-\nethanesulphonic acid]; HEPES; 10mM); 280mOsm.kg-1 H2O; pH 7.4; see (14), all purchased\nfrom the Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Gillingham, U.K.). Media of 180mOsm were obtained using\nHEPES-buffered water and checked using a freezing-point Micro Osmometer Model 3300\n(Advanced Instruments, U.S.A.).\n3.2. Cartilage preparation\nFull depth, bovine articular cartilage explants were removed under aseptic conditions with\nunderlying bone attached from the metacarpal-phalangeal joint of cattle (\u223c30mths) obtained\nfrom the local abattoir (14). Explants were maintained at 37\u00b0C and pH 7.4 in culture medium\nuntil required. Care was taken to standardize the tissue by sampling from the same distinct\nload-bearing anatomical region of all joints. Samples were incubated with calcein-AM (5\u03bcM,\n30mins at 37\u00b0C) to load the cells with the fluorescent dye calcein. PI, if required, was added\nto media to a final concentration of 5\u03bcM. Tissue was then attached to the base of a 35mm\nplastic culture dish using cyano-acrylate glue applied to a point distant from that being\nobserved. Explants were mounted transversely so that cells within the superficial through to\nthe deep zones of cartilage could be imaged.\n3.3. Excitation spectrum of intracellular calcein\nThe ability of calcein within in situ chondrocytes to interact with two-photons of a particular\nwavelength is determined by a spatial and temporal relationship (cross section area; cm4.s\/\nphoton), and was measured on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100MP multi-photon\/laser scanning unit\n(Carl Zeiss Ltd., Herts., UK) attached to a Nikon E600FN upright microscope (Nikon Ltd.,\nSurrey, UK) using a Nikon 60x\/1.0NA ceramic water-dipping objective. Two-photon\nexcitation was provided by a Chameleon\u00ae titanium-sapphire NIR tuneable laser (Coherent\nInc., CA, U.S.A.). This system was utilised because automated spectral acquisitions were\ncontrolled by custom Visual Basic scripts within LaserSharp software (John Dempster,\nUniversity of Strathclyde). The laser beam was attenuated with an electro-optical modulator\n(model 350-50-02-BK, ConOptics) and the system calibrated and controlled by the script to\nBush et al. Page 3\nFront Biosci.

Calcein fluorescence was detected using non-de-scanned detectors (emission from\n500-550nm) and the TPE fluorescence cross-sections were obtained from the mean\nfluorescence at each wavelength, normalised by the wavelength and sample pulse duration\n(Carpe, APE, Berlin, Germany) (23).\n3.4. Zeiss LSM510 NLO\/Coherent Verdi Mira imaging system\nAn upright Zeiss Axioskop LSM510 NLO (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, Herts, UK)\nlaser scanning microscope with visible and NIR pulsed excitation sources was used to acquire\nfluorescent images of in situ calcein-loaded, mid-zone chondrocytes with a C-Apochromat\n63x\/0.95NA ceramic water-dipping objective. The system employed is shown\ndiagrammatically in Figure 1.\nVisible wavelength imaging of calcein (EXmax = 494nm, EMmax = 517nm) was performed\nusing a 488nm argon laser, and fluorescence detected using internal (de-scanned) detectors,\nwith the light passing through a 500-550nm band pass filter. When required, simultaneous\nimaging of PI (EXmax = 536nm, EMmax = 617nm) was performed by adding a helium\/neon\n543nm laser, fluorescence being detected through a long pass 560nm filter. Confocal pinholes\nin front of each detector were set to 1 Airy unit.\nTwo-photon excitation was provided by a 10W Verdi\/Mira manually tunable (range\n700-1000nm) NIR pulsed titanium-sapphire laser (Coherent Inc., CA, U.S.A.). The maximal\nability of our system to elicit calcein fluorescence was determined by measuring the \u2018at sample\u2019\npower (LaserCheck, Coherent Inc., CA, U.S.A.) over the range 720-920nm. Detection of\ncalcein and PI fluorescence was performed using either internal detectors (as for the visible\nexcitation protocol described above, except that detector pinhole diameters were opened to\ntheir maximum of 1000\u03bcm), or using NDDs. The NDD system employed two detectors that\nshare the epi-fluorescent excitation path of the microscope. All manual epi-fluorescence irises\nwere left fully open and neutral density filters removed during NDD detection. The\nfluorescence emission light was diverted from the scanning unit and directed towards the \u2018non-\nde-scanned\u2019 photomultipliers. The NDD unit comprised a 560nm chromatic reflector with\n500-550nm and 575-640nm band pass filters for calcein and PI, respectively. The emission\nlight path for TPE routinely contained a BG39 filter to block any reflected NIR light.\n3.5. In situ chondrocyte viability\nCell death was identified by morphological changes (non-osmotically induced swelling), a\nrapid loss of calcein fluorescence. In cells where calcein fluorescence was low due to photo-\nbleaching, the additional reduction in calcein signal associated with cell death was difficult to\nvisualise. In such cases, two further methods of cell viability were employed. Firstly, the\nvisualization of cell morphology, showed an increase in diameter just prior to loss of calcein.\nSecondly, PI, which is impermeable to viable cells, only fluoresces once bound to nucleic acids\nof cells with a compromised plasma membrane. Calcein in conjunction with analogues of\nethidium iodides are common assays of cell viability (24). A range of TPE wavelengths was\nemployed (720-960nm) to compare cell viability with 488nm OPE exposure.\nTo standardize imaging protocols under different excitation wavelength conditions, detector\nsensitivity voltage was kept constant and image brightness between samples adjusted by\naltering excitation laser power, thereby maintaining a consistent level of calcein fluorescence.\nDue to the longevity of cells under certain excitation wavelengths, and also to achieve\ndifferential levels of cell death over a 30min time course, a relatively low detector gain of 500V\nwas used, which subsequently required greater laser power. The requisite image intensity was\nachieved when the brightest cells in the field of view exhibited a maximum grey scale intensity\nBush et al. Page 4\nFront Biosci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2008 December 19.\nU\nKPM\nC\n Funders G\nroup Author M\nanuscript\nU\nKPM\nC\n Funders G\nroup Author M\nanuscript\nof 250-254 (8-bit grey scale 0-255), thus avoiding pixel saturation. Care was taken to minimize\nthe exposure of cells to laser light during set-up. Image acquisition was performed using a\ndigitisation of 512\u00d7512 pixels (area \u2248146\u03bcm2). Line scans were averaged 4x with each frame\ntaking \u22484secs to complete. Image acquisition was stopped after all the cells in the field of view\nhad either died or been exposed to a minimum of 30 minutes of continuous exposure.\n3.6. Imaging of chondrocytes deep within cartilage\nIn situ chondrocytes were loaded with calcein as described above. Protocols for calcein-loaded\nchondrocytes deep in cartilage were similar to those used for assessment of cell viability,\nhowever for these measurements, PI was not present in the culture medium. In addition, unlike\nthe protocols for measuring cell viability, optimum imaging (i.e. the best possible contrast\nbetween cell and background) was achieved by adjusting both detector sensitivity and laser\npower which was increased to offset loss of signal with imaging depth. For the maximum\npossible laser power at our disposal, the splitting mirror (see Figure 1, normally used to divide\nthe NIR laser between inverted and upright microscope systems) was removed. A maximum\ndetector gain of 750V was used, as higher voltages resulted in an unacceptable level of image\nnoise. Images were acquired at 30 m depth intervals from the cut surface using internal de-\nscanned (confocal path) detectors and the NDDs at wavelengths between 720 and 960nm with\n40nm intervals. Similarly, 488nm confocal images were obtained using the same protocols\nwith the confocal path pinhole set for 1 Airy disk.\n3.7. Measurement of in situ chondrocyte volume and volume regulation\nImages of calcein-loaded in situ chondrocytes were acquired using a scanning speed of \u223c1.2Hz\nwith double frame integration for a 512x512 pixel image (see above). At each time point,\n\u223c30x serial images were acquired using 1\u03bcm z-sectioning. Following the acquisition of images\nfor resting cell volumes, media were changed from 280 to 180mOsm by manual aspiration\nwith the decrease in osmolarity complete in <15secs. Subsequent time-lapse images were then\nacquired 10secs after the media change and repeated every 60secs over a 30min period. This\nprotocol was performed for 488nm OPE and compared with 800nm TPE and NDD detection.\n3.8. Image analysis\n3.8.1 In situ chondrocyte volume estimation\u2014OPE and TPE data sets, correctly\nacquired, can provide 3D information that can be reconstructed using imaging software to\nprovide quantitative volumetric data of in situ chondrocytes (15). A water-dipping objective\nlens was used to reduce spherical aberrations (25). The sample refractive index was assumed\nto be close to water, thus no adjustments were made for an actual focal plane relative to the\nmechanical (focus motor) focal plane.\nTo correctly determine the volume of an object, the edge of the cell must be determined\naccurately. This was achieved using a threshold segmentation method. Individual cells were\n\u2018isolated\u2019 as regions of interest and a 40 or 45% threshold (for OPE or TPE respectively) used\nto identify the boundary between the cell (foreground) and matrix (background) using Volocity\nsoftware (Improvision Inc., MA, U.S.A.). The thresholds used for OPE and TPE were\nconfirmed by calibration using 10.16\u00b10.1\u03bcm diameter fluorescent latex beads (Polyscience\nInc., U.S.A.).\n3.8.2. Calculation of calcein bleaching rate\u2014The continuous scanning of in situ\nchondrocytes used to determine cell viability also provided data for the measurement of the\ncalcein bleaching rate. The reduction in dye fluorescence was obtained by measuring the\naverage fluorescence within a region encompassing the image of individual cells using LSM\n5 Image Examiner\u2122 software (Carl Zeiss Ltd., Herts., UK). Average fluorescence was plotted\nvs time, and half times (min-1) for the reduction in calcein fluorescence were recorded from\nBush et al. Page 5\nFront Biosci.

Estimation of contrast measurement with image depth\u2014Assessment of\nchondrocyte image quality deep into cartilage was performed by measuring the contrast\nbetween cell \u2018foreground\u2019 and cartilage matrix \u2018background\u2019 (signal:background).\nQuantification was achieved using Zeiss LSM Image Examiner\u2122 software by drawing a line\nthrough the longest diameter of the cell and producing an intensity plot profile. The portion of\nthe plot corresponding to the edge of the cell was fitted by linear regression (Excel, Microsoft,\nU.S.A.) and the gradient (change in fluorescence intensity\/m (Dfi\/\u03bcm)) recorded.\n3.9. Data analysis\nData were expressed as means\u00b1SD from n cells. Where applicable, means were compared using\nStudent\u2019s unpaired or paired t-tests as appropriate between or within independent experiments\nrespectively.\n4. RESULTS\n4.1. Fluorescence profile for TPE excitation of intracellular calcein\nThe relative emission fluorescence of calcein, using constant \u2018at sample\u2019 laser power (5mW),\nover the range of 720-960nm TPE wavelengths is shown in Figure 2. The data for average\ncalcein fluorescence from a single optical section through three chondrocytes in situ varied\nmarkedly with NIR excitation wavelength. Maximal emissions were obtained using TPE\naround 920-930nm, below double the OPE EXmax of 488nm. Additionally, TPE from 720nm\nto 780nm also elicited strong calcein fluorescence, with a marked reduction from 800nm to\n900nm. However, the relative transmission of NIR wavelengths through the Zeiss LSM510\nsystem decreased sharply above 840nm. Therefore, at the measured peak calcein excitation\nTPE wavelengths, \u223c920nm, limited system TPE potential was available at the sample plane.\n4.2. The effect of OPE vs TPE on in situ chondrocyte viability\nCell death was determined by morphological changes (notably an increase in cell diameter not\nassociated with a change in extra-cellular osmolarity) and also by a rapid loss of calcein\nfluorescence, over and above calcein bleaching, followed by the appearance of PI fluorescence.\nAn example is shown (Figure 3) for two adjacent cells exposed to continuous 780nm TPE.\nFigure 3(a) shows images of the cells at 5, 15, 25, and 35mins with intracellular fluorescence\nplotted vs time (Figure 3(b)). The lower cell survived TPE over the entire time course, with\ncalcein fluorescence bleaching clearly evident. The upper cell exhibited a similar rate of calcein\nbleaching, but at 20mins showed a further rapid loss of calcein fluorescence with a subsequent\nappearance of red PI fluorescence confirming cell death.\nTable 1 shows the percentage viability and the average time for cell death to occur after 30mins\ncontinuous laser exposure. Two of the 14 cells (14%) imaged using 488nm OPE appeared to\ndie, both cells surviving for nearly 30mins. A large reduction in cell viability using 720nm\nTPE was observed, with 86% of the cells dying over an average exposure time of \u223c12mins.\nTPE at 760nm was adept at reducing cell survival still further, with all cells exposed dying\nwithin a few mins. With the TPE wavelength raised to 800nm, chondrocyte survival improved,\nwith no cell death observed at TPE wavelengths of 840nm and above. In other experiments,\nno cell death was observed with TPE wavelengths above 880nm, even after 60min exposure.\nThe use of NDDs improved sensitivity and hence reduced the laser power required for\nmeasurable calcein fluorescence under the TPE conditions employed. Where cell death was\nobserved with de-scanned detection, NDD detection improved cell viability at all wavelengths,\nbut most noticeably at 760nm where cell survival improved from zero to \u223c50%. The time for\nBush et al. Page 6\nFront Biosci.

Intracellular calcein bleaching: OPE vs TPE\nCalcein bleaching is illustrated for two cells (Figure 3(b)), with the rate being determined by\nmeasuring the fluorescence of a ROI encompassing the cell boundary, and plotted vs time. A\ndramatic loss in fluorescence associated with cell death was omitted from bleaching rate\ncalculations. Half-life constants (t\u00bd) of bleaching were derived from the exponential decay line\nfit (inset of Figure 3) and values plotted (Figure 4). Unexpectedly, because of the numerous\nfactors affecting the rate of bleaching, a single exponential decay curve fitted the data well, as\nseen for non-mobile fluorescein (26). This was surprising given the majority of intracellular\ncalcein is mobile, hence its use as a cell viability \u2018reporter\u2019 with rapid loss occurring when the\nplasma membrane becomes compromised (27). Double exponential analysis showed no\nimprovement in fit (r2=0.986 and 0.979, single and double decay respectively).\nOPE caused a greater rate of bleaching, however TPE-induced bleaching with wavelengths\nbelow 800nm was only marginally better than OPE. TPE bleaching rates were dramatically\nreduced at 800 and 840nm, while wavelengths >840nm showed no measurable bleaching.\nFigure 4 also shows the rate of bleaching was not consistent across TPE wavelengths. Bleaching\nwas relatively high for 720 and 760nm TPE, compared to 800 and 840nm. The application of\nNDD detection further reduced calcein bleaching at all TPE wavelengths. This appeared most\npronounced at longer TPE wavelengths, since at 840nm t\u00bd increased by 10mins. However\nwhen the improvement afforded by NDD on t\u00bd was analysed in relative terms, 760nm TPE\ncalcein bleaching showed the biggest benefit with t\u00bd lengthening from 0.37 to 6.69mins, a 20x\nincrease.\n4.4. Depth of imaging: OPE vs TPE\nThe ability of different excitation wavelengths to generate intracellular calcein images deep\ninto articular cartilage is shown in Figure 5. Images were acquired at 30\u03bcm intervals into the\ntissue from the cut surface (see Materials and Methods), with the same field of view being\nimaged with or without NDDs at each TPE wavelength employed. The 488nm OPE images\nwere taken of identical fields of view used for 720nm TPE. Unlike previous protocols, 750V\ndetector gain was used, and to maintain signal:background ratio the laser power was increased\nas deeper images were acquired.\nThe depth of imaging possible at varying TPE (Figure 5) was of a similar pattern to that shown\nfor the calcein excitation profile (Figure 2), since the ability of TPE to elicit an image deep\ninto the cartilage was similar to the relative efficiency of TPE to excite intracellular calcein.\nSurprisingly, OPE 488nm CLSM images produced comparable or better image contrast with\ndepth than all TPE wavelengths used (720-920nm) with de-scanned detection. The use of\nNDDs improved the depth of imaging possible with all the TPE wavelengths examined, but\nonly 920nm showed a large improvement in imaging depth, from 180\u25a1m to 330\u25a1m. However\nthe quality of images from deeper within the tissue was very poor.\nOur application requires an image of adequate quality to accurately determine cell volume, and\nthis may render the deeper images acquired with TPE unusable. The volume analysis relies\nupon accurate identification of the edge of a cell, which is dependent upon the contrast between\nthe extra-cellular matrix (background) and chondrocyte (foreground). Hence the greater the\ncontrast between cell fluorescence and extra-cellular matrix, the more accurate the edge\ndetection becomes. Image contrast was determined as defined (see Materials and Methods),\nthe contrast being calculated along a line plotted through the longitudinal axis of each cell\nimaged at increasing depths into the cartilage. The rate of fluorescence intensity change from\nBush et al. Page 7\nFront Biosci.

The data plotted as a\n3D contour refers to images of cells obtained using NDDs, whereas the data obtained without\nNDDs are drawn as black lines. TPE of 720, and 840 to 920nm provided the best contrast, but\nas with all wavelengths used, the contrast decreased quickly with depth.\nTo ascertain the minimum contrast required to calculate accurate volumes, a group of in situ\ncells were imaged using identical scan settings as used for regulatory volume decrease (RVD)\nexperimental protocols (see Materials and Methods). Detector gain was sequentially reduced\nto mimic a reduction in contrast (data not shown). Subsequent volume analysis indicated that\nonly cells with a contrast >75Dfi\/\u03bcm resulted in consistent volumes. Cell volume estimates\nbelow this value were considered unreliable. Therefore, from curve fit data, only cell images\nobtained up to a depth of 114 \u03bcm using 488nm OPE, and for TPE 165\u03bcm (no-NDD) and\n174\u03bcm (NDD) could reliably be used for quantitative cell volume analysis in our system.\n4.5. In situ chondrocyte RVD: comparison of OPE vs TPE\nTPE of 760nm provided the greatest \u2018at sample\u2019 power for our system and ability to produce\ncalcein fluorescence (Figure 2). However, the detrimental effects on cell viability (Table 1)\nand calcein bleaching (Figure 4) discounted it from successful frequent imaging protocols.\nWavelengths \u2265900nm were optimal for eliciting calcein fluorescence (Figure 2), and the best\nfor cell survival (Table 1) and minimal calcein bleaching (Figure 4), the transmission levels to\nthe sample were poor (Figure 2). Hence as a compromise, a TPE wavelength of 800nm was\nchosen to compare with 488nm OPE.\nThe response of in situ articular chondrocytes to a hypo-osmotic challenge (280-180mOsm)\napplied to a cartilage explant is shown in Figure 7. Time-lapse 3D data sets obtained at 60sec\nintervals (30\u00d7 1\u03bcm sections, with a 25sec rest period between each 3D acquisition). The\nprojected image from two typical cells exhibiting similar maximum swelling imaged using\n800nm (Figure 7(a), upper panel) and 488nm (Figure 7(a), lower panel) at selected time points\nis shown. The cell imaged using 800nm TPE showed no evidence of calcein bleaching, whereas\nthe cell imaged using 488nm OPE was clearly less bright with time. Measured volumes from\neach cell at each imaged time point are shown in Figure 7(b). Both excitation protocols reported\na significant and equal increase in cell volume on exposure to 180 from 280mOsm and cell\nvolume recovery was subsequently observed. The rate of RVD was identical over initial time\npoints. As the TPE imaged cell continued to show RVD in an expected manner (12), OPE\nimaging resulted in an increase in apparent RVD behaviour. The cell imaged using OPE\napparently showed a reduction of \u224840% from its resting volume. On further inspection, this\nwas due to calcein bleaching reducing the contrast between cell and matrix, the contrast\neventually being insufficient to enable an accurate determination of cell volume.\n5. DISCUSSION\nWe have assessed whether there are quantitative advantages offered by an \u2018off the shelf\u2019 TPE\nsystem over standard OPE CLSM. We found that TPE reduced fluorophore bleaching.\nHowever, cell viability and depth of acquisition with adequate image quality were only slightly\nimproved. The benefits of TPE were highly wavelength-dependent, i.e. for cell viability the\nadvantages were more pronounced at longer wavelengths, whereas the ability to elicit strong\ncalcein excitation was only evident using our system at shorter wavelengths.\n5.1. TPE of calcein\nCalcein fluorescence is widely used for volume and viability measurements (24,27-29), and is\nutilised here to compare and optimise TPE and OPE imaging on a commercial system.

TPE between 910-930nm was most efficient\nat eliciting calcein fluorescence with TPE of 730-780nm also being effective, a similar profile\nto the parent compound fluorescein (30,31).\nWhilst calcein TPE fluorescence shown in Figure 2 was obtained with a constant \u2018at sample\u2019\npower (5mW), the availability of TPE at a given wavelength at the sample plane depends on\nthe laser output and loss of power through the system. The \u2018at sample average power\u2019 is very\nimportant for TPE where fluorescence intensity increases by the square of the excitation power\n(26). Manufacturer\u2019s data (Coherent Inc., CA, U.S.A.) show maximal laser power at \u223c800nm,\nbut when system transmission is also taken into consideration, a peak \u2018at sample\u2019 power of\nonly 8.2mW was recorded at 760nm (Figure 2). The \u2018at sample\u2019 power available reduced\nalarmingly beyond 800nm, and at 900nm reduced to \u223c2mW or 1\/16th the TPE compared to\nthe sample TPE peak at 760nm. Although our \u2018pen-meter\u2019 measurements were not precise, the\n\u2018at sample\u2019 power results are similar to those reported for a near-identical Zeiss LSM510 NLO\nsystem fitted with a 40x\/1.3NA Plan NeoFluar objective (32). The optimum wavelength for\nfluorophore excitation in our system (760nm) however, may not reflect the ideal set-up for a\nparticular experiment (see below).\n5.2. Rates of calcein bleaching: OPE vs TPE\nWhilst OPE produced greater photo-bleaching rates, bleaching rates with TPE varied with the\nwavelength employed (Figure 4). Fluorescence emission intensity was matched across all TPE\nwavelengths, therefore TPE induced photo-bleaching was not simply a consequence of the\nnumber of fluorophore excitation events. Bleaching rates were considerable at 720 and 760nm\nTPE, in agreement with a previous study predicting more focal volume bleaching with TPE\ncompared to OPE (26). Bleaching rates were only reduced at the longer TPE wavelengths\n>800nm. The reason for such high rates of bleaching <800nm was unclear, but not due to\nvariations in the NIR pulse width (26) or subsequent single photon absorption after TPE (33).\nImproved photo-stability with \u223c800nm TPE has also been demonstrated for Fura-4F in cardiac\nmyocytes using a commercial system and not using NDD (23). The choice of excitation\nwavelength was important. Reducing laser exposure, by improved detection sensitivity is also\nkey in reducing photo-bleaching (6) as shown by improved photo-stability with the use of\nNDDs (see section 5.5).\n5.3. Comparison of OPE vs TPE on cell viability\nPrevious studies show TPE illumination can be detrimental to live cell imaging (5,9,21,\n34-41). However the majority of these studies were examining the effect of total power, pulse\nwidth, and exposure time, using few TPE wavelengths. The wavelength dependence of photo-\ndamage shown here, agreed with previous observations of photo-toxicity associated with\noptical tweezers (21,40,41). Eukaryotic cells were most sensitive to TPE of 750-760nm (40,\n41) and 900nm (40) during optical trapping. Whilst there may be differences in the reports of\nlonger TPE (>800nm) wavelength dependence of photo-toxicity, the deleterious effects of TPE\n<800nm are in agreement with our study. We show cell damage at TPE <800nm was more\nsevere than imaging using 488nm OPE, even when NDDs were employed to reduce TPE\nexposure.\nThe pattern of TPE wavelength cyto-toxicity dependence is similar to the cross-sectional\nspectra of endogenous flavoproteins, the TPE of flavonoids NAD(P)H, FAD, and LipDH peak\nat 700nm with a minimum at \u223c800nm (38). The photoreduction of endogenous flavoproteins\nby TPE liberates free reactive oxygen species (ROS; (42)) which can trigger a cellular cascade,\nultimately resulting in death, as shown in PtK2 cells exposed to relatively low levels of TPE\nillumination (37). The addition of free radical scavengers e.g. catalase (42), ascorbate (43), or\nBush et al. Page 9\nFront Biosci.

For experiments where cell viability\nis an issue but TPE is preferred, the understanding of photo-toxicity across the range of TPE\nwavelengths is important.\n5.4. Improved tissue depth of imaging by TPE compared to OPE\nReduced tissue absorption and scattering of NIR wavelengths, together with the focal nature\nof TPE permitting non-confocal detection, should provide imaging deeper within biological\nspecimens compared with OPE. Previous studies appear persuasive but were often obtained\nusing modified systems with bespoke detection devices (3,45). Whilst our data concur with\nrespect to improved imaging depth, only 920nm TPE with de-scanned detection made marked\nimprovements compared to OPE, and not to the doubling of depth as reported elsewhere (3,\n25). This was in part due to the imaging depth (210\u03bcm) obtained with 488nm OPE, impressive\nwhen compared to the theoretical OPE image maximum of \u2248100\u03bcm (46). In a comparable\nstudy, the image depth obtained in rat cartilage with 488nm OPE of Oregon-green was only\n69\u03bcm(45).\nWhilst 920nm TPE is optimal for calcein fluorescence, it is associated with extremely poor \u2018at\nsample\u2019 power (Figure 2), yet still managed to produce the greatest imaging depth. It is possible\nthat reduced tissue scattering with increased wavelength compensated for poor power\navailability, the quadratic dependence of two-photon absorption making the process extremely\nsensitive to the power available. Emitted light may also be subject to tissue scattering, and even\nwith the detector pinhole fully open is still relatively \u2018confocal\u2019. Indeed, significant\nimprovements to imaging depth were obtained when NDDs were employed using 920nm TPE\n(330\u03bcm, Figure 5), far exceeding any other TPE wavelength with identical NDD protocols.\nHowever, image quality from NDD detection at improved depths was poor. Our analysis\nprotocols require image quality high enough to obtain reliable estimates of cell volume as\npreviously described to determine chondrocyte volume within bovine (14,15,28) and human\ncartilage (16,19). This thresholding technique loses accuracy if the contrast between cell and\nbackground fluorescence is diminished (i.e. reduced signal:background ratio). To provide a\nmeasure of S:B, the gradient of fluorescence intensity between cell and extra-cellular matrix\nwas determined (Figure 6). The shallower the gradient, the greater the error in accurate edge\ndetection and hence cell volume estimation. An error of \u224810% in the diameter of a spherical\ncell will result in error of \u224830% in its volume. This is equivalent to an in situ chondrocyte\nvolume change caused by a 100mOsm dilution in the culture media (15) and could clearly lead\nto a serious misinterpretation of results. A gradient below \u224875Dfi\/\u03bcm resulted in poor volume\nestimation (data not shown). Therefore, for our volume measurements, TPE imaging did offer\nsome advances over OPE. The application of NDDs did little to improve imaging depth further.\nHowever, for some applications, images acquired with NDD detection 300\u25a1m into cartilage\nmay be adequate for other purposes For example, we have observed potentially important,\nlarge abnormal cytoplasmic processes in osteoarthritic human cartilage (16,47) deep into the\ntissue using TPE.\n5.5. Comparison of \u2018de-scanned\u2019 and \u2018non-descanned\u2019 detection systems\nNDDs improve emission light detection sensitivity by positioning the detectors out of the\n\u2018scanning\u2019 route used for standard CLSM, reducing the mirrors, filters, and the pinhole\naperture, each of which reduce the total number of photons reaching de-scanned detectors.\nSubsequent improved detection sensitivity should enhance cell viability (Table 1), reduce\nbleaching (Figure 4), and preserve contrast with increased imaging depth (Figures 5-6).\nHowever, the improvements we observed were not dramatic. The NDDs of our system, while\nsituated out-with the \u2018scanning route\u2019, were not optimally positioned. The NDDs were a long\ndistance from the sample plane, and mirrors\/irises in the detection pathway reduced detection\nsensitivity.\nBush et al. Page 10\nFront Biosci. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2008 December 19.\nU\nKPM\nC\n Funders G\nroup Author M\nanuscript\nU\nKPM\nC\n Funders G\nroup Author M\nanuscript\nStudies showing dramatic depth of imaging improvements using NDDs tend to have detectors\nsituated directly beneath the objective lens (direct trans-detection), emitted detection used\nalone (3) or combined with epi-fluorescence NDDs (48). Whilst such systems are becoming\ncommercially available, they tend to be designed for specific applications, and may not be\nsuitable for a multiuser\/study facility. Multifunctional turn-key TPE systems tend to be\nadaptations of existing CLSM configurations with limited redesigns of the optical microscope,\nreducing the possible placement of NDDs and not optimising the emission detection pathway.\nAlthough detector development continually offers improved sensitivity, positioning of NDDs\nin an optically \u2018cleaner\u2019 light path would provide significant improvement in image acquisition\nand make the purchase of these detectors a valuable addition. Otherwise, the cost would only\nbe appropriate if any small improvement in imaging sensitivity were advantageous.\n5.6. Comparison of OPE vs TPE for measuring RVD\nIn situ chondrocytes were exposed to hypo-osmolarity, initial cell swelling (15) and subsequent\nvolume recovery were almost identical using either OPE or TPE. However, after the 5th image,\nthe volumes determined using the two techniques diverged (Figure 7). Calcein bleaching in\ncells imaged using OPE, resulted in a reduced S:B ratio and erroneous cell volume estimations.\nThus, observations of in situ chondrocyte volume in previous studies were limited to \u223c5 time\npoints (14-16,19), and even less for fragile chondrocytes within degenerate human cartilage\n(unpublished observations). In contrast, 18 consecutive images over 25mins were obtained\nusing TPE, with the chondrocytes showing the anticipated (14) volume regulatory behaviour\nof healthy cells.\n5.7. Summary\nSince 1994 (4) the potential to Life Sciences of an \u2018improved\u2019 laser scanning microscope using\nTPE became possible with the advent of commercially-available solid-state NIR pulsed lasers.\nDue to the high cost of these systems, a justification of the benefits afforded by TPE over OPE\nshould be demonstrated. For many TPE laser scanning microscopy studies, the proposed\nimprovements of TPE appear justified. However to date there are very few studies that\nsystematically describe these proposed advantages using \u2018off the shelf\u2019 equipment.\nFor our system, and protocols for calcein-loaded in situ chondrocytes, we showed that TPE\ndoes offer improvements over 488nm OPE, but the overall picture is complex. The greatest\nadvantage of TPE was the reduction in calcein photo-bleaching and improvement in cell\nviability at TPE >800nm. This allowed better temporal resolution and permitted more accurate\ntracking of cell RVD. Whilst the increased image depth was evident, for our purposes the image\nquality was not of a high enough S:B ratio to allow accurate image processing and would not\nbe a justification for utilising TPE alone.\nTPE above 900nm offered optimal calcein fluorescence, the lowest dye bleaching rates, and\ndeepest image acquisition, but the transmission of these longer wavelengths through our system\nto the sample was poor. Improvements in the NIR transmission spectrum of acousto-optical\nmudulators are desired. Furthermore the system sensitivity is critical, and reducing the\nexcitation insult to living cells will further improve viability (44) and reduce fluorophore\nbleaching. Improved positioning of NDDs is required to maximise their potential.\nIt is clear that optimal imaging conditions are not easy to determine without initial trials being\nperformed. Unfortunately this relies upon having access to a two-photon laser scanning\nmicroscopy system and associated staff before deciding whether the outlay is justified. Other\ntechniques made available by focal pulsed excitation, e.g. photolysis of \u2018caged\u2019 compounds\n(49) and fluorescent lifetime imaging (FLIM; 50), may help validate the high system cost.\nBush et al.

(b) The volume of each cell was determined and\nplotted relative to the initial volume vs time. Hypo-osmotic challenge caused an initial increase\nin cell volume (\u224830%) followed by matched RVD in both cells over the next 3 time points.\nAfter the 5th time point (arrow) the 488nm exposed cell appeared to show accelerated RVD\ncompared with TPE.
