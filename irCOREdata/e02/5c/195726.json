Introduction \nDecisions with uncertain outcomes are often made repeatedly. For example, gamblers \nplay the same games repeatedly, savers choose repeatedly where to invest their money, and \nchess players choose repeatedly from their opening repertoires. A remarkable feature of such \nrepeated decisions is that people tend to approach them in a strikingly different frame of mind \nfrom the way they approach single or unrepeated decisions. The classic illustration of this is \nthe following gamble that Samuelson (1963) offered to a colleague: on the basis of a coin toss, \na 50% chance of winning $200 and a 50% chance of losing $100. The colleague declined the \ngamble and commented: \u201cI won\u2019t bet because I would feel the $100 loss more than the $200 \ngain. But I\u2019ll take you on if you promise to let me make 100 such bets\u201d (p. 109). \nAlthough this argument seems intuitively appealing, Samuelson (1963) labeled it a fallacy \nand proved a theorem to the effect that \u201cif you would always refuse to take favorable odds on \na single toss, you must rationally refuse to participate in any (finite) sequence of such tosses\u201d \n(p. 111). Informally, assume that after 99 gambles a decision maker were offered the 100th. \nAmbiguity aversion   2 \nBy assumption, a single gamble is unacceptable, hence this one would be declined. \nFurthermore, knowing that the 100th gamble would be declined, the decision maker would \nhave recognized the 99th to be, in effect, a single gamble, and would therefore have declined \nit previously. The same reasoning unfolds back to the first decision, which would also have \nbeen declined. Tversky and Bar-Hillel (1983) proved that declining the single gamble and \naccepting the repeated gamble violates unobjectionable conditions of transitivity or \ndominance. \nPsychologically, the gamble repeated 100 times nevertheless seems more appealing than \nthe single gamble. It offers an expected gain of $5,000 with only a tiny (< 1%) probability of \nloss, compared with a 50% probability of loss from the single gamble. Lopes (1981) endorsed \nthe policy of accepting only the repeated gamble and concluded from Samuelson\u2019s (1963) \nexample that expected utility maximization \u201cis simply not sensible\u201d (p. 385). Many years later, \nshe wrote that she would \u201cneither repent nor recant\u201d that conclusion (Lopes, 1996, p. 183). \nExperimental evidence suggests that human decision makers share similar intuitions. \nMontgomery and Adelbratt (1982) explained the concept of expected value to their \nparticipants, provided them with sets of 17 gambles, each displayed with its expected value, \nand invited them to select a preferred option from each set. The participants usually deviated \nfrom expected value when making single choices \u2013 some even remarking that numerical \ncalculation was irrelevant to gambles played only once \u2013 but maximized expected value when \nrepetitions were allowed. Most of Redelmeier and Tversky\u2019s (1992) participants accepted \nrepeated gambles but rejected the corresponding single gamble. DeKay and Kim (2005) \nreplicated this effect, at least for decisions involving monetary payoffs. Keren and Wagenaar \n(1987) and Keren (1991) observed violations of expected utility theory (certainty and \npossibility effects) in single choices but not in repeated choices. Wedell and B\u00f6ckenholt (1990, \n1994) reported that preference reversal, another violation of expected utility theory, was \nsignificantly reduced under repeated choices, and most participants justified their repeated \nbut not their single choices by integrating probabilities with outcomes. Experimental \nevidence converges on the conclusion that decision makers generally conform more closely to \nnormative expected utility theory in repeated than single gambles. \n \n1.1. Loss aversion \nA compelling reason for rejecting a single gamble with positive monetary value is loss \naversion. This is a greater sensitivity to losses than to gains, represented in prospect theory \n(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) by a point of inflection in its utility function at the origin. \nRecall that Samuelson\u2019s (1963) colleague refused the single gamble for this very reason. \nTversky and Kahneman (1992) estimated that losses are weighted 2.25 times as heavily as \ngains, relative to the status quo point, so that the disutility of losing $100 is more than twice \nthe utility of gaining $100. Suppose a decision maker\u2019s utility for gains is equal to monetary \nAmbiguity aversion   3 \nvalue but for losses is equal to monetary value multiplied by 2.25. Then the expected utility \nof the single gamble offering 50% chance of winning $200 and a 50% chance of losing $100 \nis negative: (1\/2)(200) + (1\/2)(\u2013100 \u00d7 2.25) = \u201325, but the expected utility of the repeated \nversion is positive. For example, the expected utility of a portfolio of two gambles is \n(1\/4)(400) + (1\/2)(100) + (1\/4)(\u2013200 \u00d7 2.25) = 37.50. This provides a possible explanation for \nthe greater attractiveness of repeated gambles. When loss aversion arises from narrow \nframing, it is called myopic loss aversion (Benartzi & Thaler, 1995, 1999; Thaler, Tversky, \nKahneman, & Schwartz, 1997). For example, myopic loss aversion could cause Samuelson\u2019s \ncolleague to decline a single gamble offered on 100 successive days, although the \n100-gamble sequence would be acceptable if broadly framed as an aggregated portfolio. \nIn mixed gambles involving potential gains and losses, an outcome parameter of \nparticular salience to loss-averse decision makers is the probability of loss. Preferences for \ngambles are known to be more highly correlated with probabilities of gain\/loss than with \npayoff sizes (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 1971; Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1968; Tversky, Sattath, & \nSlovic, 1988). In many cases, the probability of loss is smaller in a repeated gamble than in \nthe corresponding single gamble, although this is counterbalanced by the increased size of the \npossible loss. Loss aversion coupled with a tendency to focus specifically on the probability \nof loss may explain the relative attractiveness of such repeated gambles. \nFor practical and ethical reasons, experiments incorporating actual rather than \nhypothetical payoffs generally involve smaller or larger gains, rather than gains and losses, \nruling out direct investigation of loss aversion and the risk-seeking behavior that it is believed \nto induce. However, Bosch-Dom\u00e8nech and Silvestre (2006) studied actual gains and losses \nand found that, for large losses, most decision makers were risk averse rather than risk \nseeking. Nevertheless, in circumstances in which loss aversion does occur, it seems \nreasonable to assume that it extends, to a degree at least, to opportunity costs. A loss-averse \ndecision maker is likely to be motivated not only to avoid absolute losses, but also to avoid \nrelative losses involved in forgoing potentially more rewarding options. \n \n1.2. Ambiguity aversion \nRepetition effects have been investigated thoroughly in known-risk gambles, but no \nsystematic comparisons of single and repeated ambiguous gambles appear to have been \npublished, although Einhorn and Hogarth (1986) included a parameter representing the amount \nof new information gained (e.g., from repetitions) in their formal model of decision making \nunder ambiguity (Equation 9; see also Einhorn & Hogarth, 1985, Equations 8 and 9). \nAmbiguous choices are those for which outcome probabilities cannot be calculated or \nestimated from empirical evidence. Knight (1921), who first highlighted them, used the term \nuncertain for what is less ambiguously called ambiguous and gave an example of two men \ndrawing balls from an urn: \u201cOne man knows that there are red and black balls, but is ignorant of \nAmbiguity aversion   4 \nthe numbers of each; another knows that the numbers are three of the former to one of the \nlatter\u201d (pp. 218\u2013219). The first man chooses under ambiguity; the second under risk. \nMost decision makers prefer risky to ambiguous choices. This is the ambiguity aversion \neffect, the classic demonstration of which is the Ellsberg paradox (Ellsberg, 1961). Two urns \nare filled with red and black balls, Urn A containing 50 red and 50 black balls, randomly mixed, \nand Urn B an unknown ratio of 100 red and black balls, randomly mixed. A decision maker \nchooses a color (red or black) and then an urn (A or B) from which to draw, winning a prize for \ndrawing a ball of the chosen color. Typically, 60\u201370% of decision makers prefer to draw from \nthe risky Urn A, and experimental evidence has shown this effect to be powerful and robust \n(Camerer & Weber, 1992; Curley & Yates, 1989; Frisch & Baron, 1988; Keren & Gerritsen, \n1999; Pulford & Colman, 2008; Rode, Cosmides, Hell, & Tooby, 1999). It occurs even when \ndecision makers, though ignorant of the ratio of red to black balls in Urn B, know that every \npossible ratio is equally likely, although this second-order probability information implies that \nthe first-order probabilities are equal. \n \n1.3. Modified Ellsberg urn choice \nIn the experiments described below, we used a modified Ellsberg urn choice inspired by \nSamuelson\u2019s (1963) asymmetric gamble. For a risky choice, the payoff for success was NT 500 \n(US$16.50), and for an ambiguous choice, it was NT 600 (US$20.00). Assuming all possible \ndistributions to be equally likely, an expected payoff maximizer should prefer the ambiguous \nchoice. Furthermore, a decision maker is more likely to receive a larger payoff from the \nambiguous than the risky choice. Comparing a risky and an ambiguous pair of options (R, A), \nthere are four equiprobable combinations: (0, 0), (0, 600), (500, 0), and (500, 600). In two cases \nthe ambiguous option A pays more than the risky option R, and in one case the risky option \npays more. A decision maker is therefore twice as likely to gain more from the ambiguous \noption (p = 1\/2) than from the risky option (p = 1\/4). \nThe expected value of the risky option repeated 100 times is 100  1\/2  500 = NT 25,000. \nThe probability of gaining more by choosing the repeated ambiguous option is calculated as \nfollows. If every possible distribution is equally likely, then, by symmetry, the probability of \nsuccess on each component gamble is 1\/2. A decision maker gains more from 100 repetitions \nof the ambiguous option than from 100 repetitions of the risky option (expected value = NT \n25,000) if s ambiguous gambles are successful and 600s > NT 25,000. This holds for s > \n25,000\/600, that is, for all s \u2265 42. The probability q of obtaining at least 42 successes in 100 \ngambles is \n100\n100\n42\n100\n.5 .5 .96.\ns s\ns\nq\ns\n \nAmbiguity aversion   5 \nThe probability of gaining more from the ambiguous than the risky option is therefore p = .50 \nfor a single choice and q = .96 for a choice repeated 100 times. A decision maker should \naccordingly prefer the repeated ambiguous choice to the single ambiguous choice. \nThe rest of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2 we report an experiment \ncomparing single and repeated risky and ambiguous choices, framed either as modified \nEllsberg urn choices or as marketing strategy choices. In Section 3 we report a replication in \nwhich we counterbalance presentation orders and provide participants with second-order \nprobabilities for ambiguous options. Section 4 contains a general discussion. \n \n2. Experiment 1 \nThe purpose of this experiment was to explore, apparently for the first time, decision \nmaking in single and repeated choices under both risk and ambiguity. Our main hypothesis \nwas that decision makers would choose ambiguous options more frequently in repeated than \nsingle choices, repetition thus dampening ambiguity aversion. To provide an indication of the \nrobustness of any repetition effects, we presented the decisions as either a modified Ellsberg \nurn choice or a marketing strategy choice. We did not attempt to make the marketing strategy \nchoice exactly equivalent to the urn choice, because it was not part of our intention to \ncompare the two; we needed only to compare single and repeated choices separately in each. \nWe also collected self-ratings of decision confidence. Pulford and Colman (2007, 2008) \nsuggested that ambiguity aversion may be associated with intolerance of uncertainty. They \ncited evidence that most people prefer to avoid events and circumstances that are difficult to \nunderstand, and they interpreted ambiguity aversion as a particular manifestation of this. A \nsubsidiary hypothesis was accordingly that participants would be more confident of repeated \nthan single ambiguous choices. \n \n2.1. Experimental design and decision tasks \nEach participant made a single urn choice followed by a repeated urn choice or a single \nfollowed by a repeated marketing strategy choice. The experimental design was a 2 \u00d7 2 \nfactorial experiment: Repetition (single versus repeated) \u00d7 Frame (urn choice versus \nmarketing strategy choice), with repeated measures on the repetition factor. The choices were \npresented to the participants as follows (translated from Mandarin). \n \nSingle urn choice. Image that you have a ticket to participate in one of two bets: Urn 1 \ncontains 50 red balls and 50 green balls, whereas Urn 2 contains 100 red and green balls \nin unknown proportions. The proportion of red and green balls in Urn 2 is governed by \ncomputer. Draw a ball blindly from an urn and guess its color. If you choose Urn 1 and \nyour guess is correct, then you win NT 500. If you choose Urn 2 and your guess is correct, \nthen you win NT 600. Which urn would you choose? \nAmbiguity aversion   6 \nRepeated urn choice. If such gamble is repeated 100 times, then once you choose the \nurn, you have to play the bet 100 times with the same urn. Once you have decided how to \nplay, which urn would you choose? If you choose Urn 1, then you have to guess the color \neach time before you draw a ball, and you will win NT 500 each time your guess is right \nor nothing if your guess is wrong. If you choose Urn 2, then the computer resets the \nbalance of red and green balls each time before you guess the color and draw a ball. You \nwill win NT 600 each time your guess is right or nothing if your guess is wrong. The total \nmoney you win depends on the number of times you win and the prize (NT 500 if you \nchoose Urn 1 and NT 600 if you choose Urn 2, each time). \nSingle marketing strategy choice. Image that you are the CEO of an international \ncompany, and the marketing manager has recently planned two new service programs for \nTaiwanese customers based on the company\u2019s advantages: M program and Z program. \nYou believe that both programs might create advantages and bring huge profits for the \ncompany; however, you have to choose one of them rather than both because of your \nlimited resources. Based on previous experience and the ability of competitors, the \nadvisors of your company all agree that the success probability of Option M would be \n50%. However, they argue that the probability of success of Option Z might be from 40% \nto 80%, because they are unsure whether competitors will be able to offer the same \nservice. If the program you choose is successful, then no matter whether you choose M or \nZ, you would make NT 50 million for your company. Which program would you choose? \nRepeated marketing strategy choice. As the CEO, you find out that 10 other overseas \nsubsidiary companies face the same choices between the two service programs. The \nmarket scales of the 10 countries in which your subsidiary companies are located are \nsimilar to that of Taiwan. Because your company is international, you hope to keep the \nservice programs in all subsidiaries identical. Now you have to decide which program \nwill be conducted (the success or failure of the program in one country will not influence \nthe probability of success or failure in the other country). Which one would you choose? \n \n2.2. Participants \nA convenience sample of 138 students (80 women and 58 men, mean age 24.25 years), \nrecruited by approaching students on two different campuses in Taiwan, were assigned \nrandomly to urn choice or marketing strategy choice treatment conditions, each containing 69 \nparticipants. Participants made decisions involving hypothetical payoffs but were not \nremunerated personally. \n \n2.3. Procedure \nParticipants read a page of instructions and then indicated their preferred options, first for \nthe single choice, and then, on a separate page, for the repeated choice. In the urn choice \nAmbiguity aversion   7 \ncondition, they responded to the following question in writing after each choice: \u201cOn the \nwhole, you feel __% confident that your decision would bring you the most profit.\u201d In the \nmarketing strategy choice condition, the question was: \u201cOn the whole, you feel __ % \nconfident that your decision would bring most profit for your company.\u201d Finally, they were \nthanked and debriefed. \n \n2.4. Results and discussion \nThe results are shown in Table 1. Because single and repeated choices were not \nindependent (the same participants made both), we performed chi-square goodness of fit tests \nseparately for single and repeated choices. In the single urn choice, 31.88% (22\/69) of \nparticipants chose the ambiguous option, \u03c72(1) = 9.06, p < .01, w = .36 (medium ambiguity \naversion effect size), rising to 50.72% (35\/69) for the repeated choice: \u03c72(1) = 0.01, ns (no \nambiguity aversion). Of the participants who chose the risky single urn option, 38.30% \n(18\/47) switched to the ambiguous repeated option, whereas of those who chose the \nambiguous single option, only 22.73% (5\/22) switched to the risky repeated option. \nApplication of the CATMOD modeling technique for repeated-measures categorical data \n(Stokes, Davis, & Koch, 1995) shows the difference between these two proportions to be \nsignificant: \u03c72(1) = 8.24, p < 0.01, w = .35 (medium). These choice data confirm our main \nhypothesis for urn choices. \n \nTable 1 \nExperiment 1: Numbers of participants who chose risky (R) and ambiguous (A) options in \nsingle and repeated choices, and differences in self-rated confidence (DiffConf ) between \nrepeated and single choices for participants who chose ambiguous repeated options \nSingle choice \nRepeated choice \nUrn choice  Marketing strategy choice  \nR A Total DiffConf (%) R A Total DiffConf (%) \nR 29 18 47 14.45 13 17 30 10.89 \nA 5 17 22 6.24 7 32 39 4.69 \nTotal 34 35 69  20 49 69  \n \nIn the marketing strategy condition, 56.52% (39\/69) of participants chose the ambiguous \nsingle option, \u03c72(1) = 1.17, ns, rising to 71.01% (49\/69) in the repeated choice: \u03c72(1) = 12.19, \np < .001, w = .42 (medium to large). The absence of ambiguity aversion in the single choice \nmay be due to the smaller range of probabilities of success for the ambiguous marketing \nstrategy choice (range 40\u201380%) than the ambiguous urn choice (range 0\u2013100%), probably \ndiminishing the effect of ambiguity aversion (MacCrimmon & Larsson, 1979; Yates & \nZukowski, 1976), but a repetition effect is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, 56.67% (17\/30) \nAmbiguity aversion   8 \nof participants who chose the risky single option switched to the ambiguous repeated option, \ncompared to only 17.95% (7\/39) who chose the ambiguous single option and switched to the \nrisky repeated option, and CATMOD analysis shows the difference between these proportions \nto be significant: \u03c72(1) = 4.43, p = 0.03, w = .25 (small to medium). These data confirm our \nmain hypothesis for marketing strategy choices. \nParticipants who chose ambiguous repeated options were more confident of those choices \nthan of their single choices. In Table 1, the columns labeled \u201cDiffConf\u201d show differences \nbetween self-rated confidence in repeated and single choices for participants who chose \nambiguous repeated options. Larger percentages indicate greater increases in self-rated \nconfidence from single (risky or ambiguous) choices to repeated ambiguous choices. For \nparticipants who chose the risky single urn option, then the ambiguous repeated option, \nself-rated confidence increased from 55.83% to 70.28%, and this difference (14.45%) is \nsignificantly different from zero according to a one-sample t test: t(17) = 3.73, p < .01, d = \n0.88 (large). Similarly, for those who chose the ambiguous single urn option, then the \nambiguous repeated option, self-rated confidence increased significantly from 65.29% to \n71.53%: t(16) = 4.45, p < .01, d = 1.08 (large). In contrast, participants who chose the risky \nrepeated urn option (omitted from Table 1) did not show significant changes in confidence \nrelative to risky single choices t(28) = 1.22, ns, or ambiguous single choices, t(4) = \u20131.63, p \n< .10, ns. These findings confirm our subsidiary hypothesis for urn choices. \nIn the repeated marketing strategy choice condition, self-rated confidence of participants \nwho chose the risky single option increased from 61.76% to 72.65% when they switched to \nthe ambiguous repeated option, t(16) = 3.82, p < .01, d = 0.93 (large); and confidence of \nthose who chose the ambiguous single option increased from 66.72% to 71.41% when they \nchose the ambiguous repeated option: t(31) = 3.26, p < .01, d = 0.58 (medium). In contrast, \nthose who chose the risky repeated option (omitted from Table 1) showed no significant \nchanges in confidence relative to their previous risky single choices, t(12) = \u20131.24, ns, or \nambiguous single choices t(6) = \u20131.10, ns. These confidence data replicate those for urn \nchoices and confirm our subsidiary hypothesis for marketing strategy choices. \n \n3. Experiment 2 \nTwo potentially important extraneous variables were uncontrolled in Experiment 1. First, \nthe higher expected values associated with ambiguous than risky options relied on \nparticipants assuming that all ratios of successful to unsuccessful outcomes in the ambiguous \nchoices were equally likely, but this was not made explicit to them. Second, the presentation \norders of the single and repeated choices were not counterbalanced, and consequently \ndifferences between single and repeated choices could conceivably have been due to an order \neffect. Experiment 2 was designed to correct these imperfections. \n \nAmbiguity aversion   9 \n3.1. Participants \nA convenience sample of 243 participants (180 women and 63 men, mean age 21.95 \nyears), was recruited by approaching students on two different campuses in Taiwan. \nParticipants were assigned randomly to four experimental conditions: single then repeated \nurn choice (N = 63), repeated then single urn choice (N = 55), single then repeated marketing \nstrategy choice (N = 63), and repeated then single marketing strategy choice (N = 62). As in \nExperiment 1, participants were not remunerated. \n \n3.2. Design and procedure \nThe design and procedure followed Experiment 1, with two exceptions. First, the \npresentation orders of single and repeated choices were counterbalanced, with appropriate \nmodification of the question requesting second choices. Second, participants were told \nexplicitly that every possible ratio of successful to unsuccessful outcomes of ambiguous \nchoices was equally likely. In the urn choice condition, the instructions contained the \nfollowing sentence (in Mandarin), the words in italics having been added for this experiment: \n\u201cThe proportions of red and green balls in Urn 2 are governed by computer, and every \npossible ratio is equally likely (i.e., the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, \u2026, 100 red balls are equally \nlikely).\u201d In the marketing strategy choice condition, the corresponding sentence was: \n\u201cHowever, they argue the success probability of Option Z might be from 40\u201380% (because \nthey are unsure whether competitors will be able to offer the same service), but they believe \nthat every possible probability of success is equally likely.\u201d \nThe experimental design was 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 factorial: Frame (urn choice versus marketing \nstrategy choice) \u00d7 Order (single choice first versus repeated choice first) \u00d7 Repetition (single \nversus repeated), with repeated measures on the repetition factor only. \n \n3.3. Results \nCATMOD analysis, with risky or ambiguous urn choice as the dependent variable and \norder, repetition, and the Order  Repetition interaction as sources of variance, revealed that \nonly the switch in participants\u2019 preferences between single and repeated choices was \nsignificant, \u03c72(1) = 6.39, p = .01, w = .16 (small). We therefore pooled the data across the two \ntask orders for further analysis (see Table 2). \n \nAmbiguity aversion   10 \nTable 2 \nExperiment 2: Numbers of participants who chose risky (R) and ambiguous (A) options in \nsingle and repeated choices, and differences in self-rated confidence (DiffConf ) between \nrepeated and single choices for participants who chose ambiguous repeated options \nSingle choice \nRepeated choice \nUrn choice  Marketing strategy choice  \nR A Total DiffConf (%) R A Total DiffConf (%) \nR 39 34 73 7.38 30 48 78 11.14% \nA 16 29 45 9.52 10 37 47 5.68% \nTotal 55 63 118  40 85 125  \n \nFor urn choices, only 38.14% (45\/118) of participants chose the ambiguous single option, \n\u03c72(1) = 6.64, p < .01, w = .24 (medium ambiguity aversion effect), rising to 53.39% (63\/118) \nfor the repeated option: \u03c72(1) = 0.54, ns. Moreover, 46.57% (34\/73) of participants who chose \nthe risky single option switched to the ambiguous repeated option, whereas only 35.56% \n(16\/45) of those who chose the ambiguous single option switched to the risky repeated option, \nand CATMOD analysis shows the difference between these proportions to be significant: \u03c72(1) \n= 6.39, p = .01, w = .23 (small to medium). These results replicate those of Experiment 1. \nFor marketing strategy choices, 37.60% (47\/125) of participants chose the ambiguous \nsingle option, \u03c72(1) = 7.69, p < .01, w = .25 (small to medium ambiguity aversion effect), \nrising to 68% (85\/125) in the repeated choice: \u03c72(1) = 16.20, p < .001, w = .36 (medium to \nlarge). Moreover, 61.54% (48\/78) of participants who chose the risky single option switched \nto the ambiguous repeated option, whereas only 21.28% (10\/47) of those who chose the \nambiguous single option switched to the risky repeated option, and CATMOD analysis shows \nthat the difference between these proportions is significant: \u03c72(1) = 31.17, p < 0.01, w = .50 \n(large). These findings on switching also replicate those of Experiment 1. \nIn the urn choice condition, order had no significant effect on self-rated confidence, F(1, \n116) = 0.37, ns, therefore we pooled the confidence data across orders. As in Experiment 1, \nself-rated confidence of participants who chose the risky option in the single urn choice was \nsignificantly higher when they chose the ambiguous repeated option: 50.41% versus 57.79%, \nt(33) = 1.91, p < .05, one-tailed, d = 0.33 (small to medium). Similarly, confidence of \nparticipants who chose the ambiguous single option increased significantly when they chose \nthe ambiguous repeated option, from 55.17% to 64.69%: t(28) = 3.35, p < .05, d = 0.62 \n(medium to large). In contrast, confidence hardly differed between single and repeated urn \nchoices for participants who chose the risky repeated option, regardless of whether they chose \nthe risky single option, t(38) = 0.16, ns, or the ambiguous single option, t(15) = 0.41, ns. \nThese results corroborate the findings on confidence of urn choices of Experiment 1. \nAmbiguity aversion   11 \nIn the marketing strategy choice condition, because order had no effect on confidence, \nF(1, 123) = 0.00, ns, we pooled confidence data across orders once again. Confidence of \nparticipants who chose the risky option increased when they chose the ambiguous repeated \noption, from 56.71% to 67.85%: t(47) = 4.31, p < .05, d = 0.62 (medium to large). Similarly, \nparticipants who chose the ambiguous single option showed higher confidence when they \nchose the ambiguous repeated option: 65.00% versus 70.68%, t(36) = 3.10, p < .05, d = 0.51 \n(medium). Once again, confidence levels of participants who chose the risky repeated option \nshowed no such differences, regardless of whether they chose the risky single option, t(29) \n= \u20130.49, ns, or the ambiguous single option, t(9) = 0.83, ns. These findings relating to \nconfidence of marketing strategy choices also replicate those of Experiment 1. \nTaken together, the result of this experiment fully corroborate those of Experiment 1. The \nmore rigorous controls in this experiment reinforce our confidence in the findings. \n \n4. General discussion \nOur experiments provide remarkably consistent and robust evidence of repetition effects \nin decision making under ambiguity.\n1\n In particular, participants chose ambiguous options \nsignificantly more frequently in repeated-choice than single-choice conditions. This occurred \nin Experiment 1, when the ambiguous option was truly ambiguous, and in Experiment 2, \nwhen the participants knew that all possible probabilities of success of ambiguous choices \nwere equally likely. Our results are broadly consistent with findings on decision making \nunder risk, in which participants have conformed more closely to the normative prescriptions \nof expected utility theory in repeated than single choices (DeKay & Kim, 2005; Keren, 1991; \nKeren & Wagenaar, 1987; Montgomery & Adelbratt, 1982; Redelmeier & Tversky, 1992; \nWedell & B\u00f6ckenholt, 1990, 1994). \nIn our single urn choice conditions, significant ambiguity aversion occurred, in line with \nevidence stretching back to Ellsberg (1961), but in repeated urn choices, a majority of \nparticipants chose the ambiguous options in both experiments. Furthermore, significantly \nmore participants chose the risky option in the single urn choice and the ambiguous option in \nthe repeated choice than the other way round, and this result was also replicated even when \nthe orders of single and repeated choices were counterbalanced in Experiment 2. \nTo provide an indicative check of robustness, both experiments included a marketing \nstrategy choice condition in which some features of the modified Ellsberg urn choice were \nframed in a lifelike scenario. The urn choice and marketing strategy choice were not designed \nto be fully equivalent, because we were concerned not with comparing them but with \ninvestigating repetition effects separately in each. The number of repetitions, the range of \nprobabilities of success in the ambiguous option, and the payoff structure differed slightly \nbetween the urn choices and marketing strategy choices, but these differences have no \nbearing on the repetition effects that we investigated. In Experiment 1, ambiguity aversion \nAmbiguity aversion   12 \ndid not occur in single marketing strategy choices, probably because of the relatively \nrestricted variance in the probability of success of the ambiguous choice; in Experiment 2, a \nsmall to medium ambiguity aversion effect occurred. However, in both experiments, \nparticipants chose ambiguous options more frequently in repeated than single market strategy \nchoices, and more participants chose risky single choices and ambiguous repeated choices \nthan the other way round, replicating the asymmetric switching effects found in urn choices. \nTaken together, these results suggest that repetition diminishes the effect of ambiguity \naversion. Participants found ambiguous options more attractive under conditions of repeated \nchoice. An obvious explanation for this is loss aversion, which has been used to explain \ndecision makers\u2019 greater adherence to normative principles in repeated risky gambles \n(Tversky & Bar-Hillel, 1983; Thaler et al., 1997). Loss-averse decision makers, especially \nthose who focus on the probability of loss, may be motivated to reject a single ambiguous \ngamble but to accept the same gamble if it is multiply repeated. \nAnother possible interpretation is suggested by the comments of some of Montgomery \nand Adelbratt\u2019s (1982) participants that numerical calculation is inapplicable to single \ngambles. Many people evidently believe that probability is something that applies only in the \nlong run and is irrelevant, or less relevant, to single choices. Such people may feel that the \nuncertainty inherent in ambiguous choices is somehow eliminated or reduced if the choices are \nrepeated, making probabilities seem more relevant. \nIndirect support for this interpretation comes from self-ratings of confidence in our \nexperiments. Participants who chose the ambiguous repeated options were invariably more \nconfident of their choices than of their single choices, whether their single choices were risky \nor ambiguous. This suggests that the disturbing quality of an ambiguous choice may be \ndissipated when the choice is repeated. Ambiguity-averse decision makers who feel that a \nsingle ambiguous choice is bound to go against them may anticipate a \u201cfairer\u201d outcome from \na long sequence of ambiguous choices. People who believe that luck tends to be loaded \nagainst them in single events may feel safer in repeated sequences of events, perhaps in the \nbelief that good and bad luck tend to balance out in the long run. \nOne obvious avenue for further research relates to mixed ambiguous gambles involving \npotential losses as well as gains. There is evidence suggesting that decision makers tend to \nchoose ambiguous options more frequently under such conditions (Cohen, Jaffray, & Said, \n1985; Goldsmith & Sahlin, 1983). If loss aversion is a key factor driving repetition effects, \nthen these effects should be sharpened in mixed gambles, because real losses should have \nstronger psychological effects than mere opportunity costs. Experiments exposing \nparticipants to the possibility of losing some of their own money pose serious methodological \nproblems, but gambles involving hypothetical losses or real losses from initial endowments \nof \u201chouse money\u201d are feasible. \n \nAmbiguity aversion   13 \nAcknowledgments \nThe research reported in this article was supported by research NSC 97-2410-H-218-025 \nfrom the National Science Council of Taiwan.
