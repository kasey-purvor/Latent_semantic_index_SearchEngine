The standard model 4 \nwas compared with versions in which runoff generation was described by parameterizations based 5 \non either the Probability Distributed Model (PDM) or modified forms of TOPMODEL, all of which 6 \nused probability functions to describe the subgrid distribution of soil moisture. The model results 7 \nwere compared with observed streamflow in three catchments in southern France. After calibration, 8 \nthe PDM- and TOPMODEL-based parameterizations performed substantially better than the 9 \nstandard model. The TOPMODEL approach gave the best results through allowing a more 10 \nresponsive subsurface flow that contributed to peak flows and also better captured the slower 11 \nchanges during recessions. This approach was sensitive to uncertainty in the value of the 12 \ntopographic index. The PDM-based model only changed the calculation of surface runoff and 13 \nretained the standard description of subsurface runoff, and this limited the possible improvement in 14 \nperformance. In principle the values of the new parameters can be determined from observations, 15 \nbut in practice calibration is likely to be required. However, for each new parameterization, a single 16 \nset of parameter values was found that performed well in all catchments. The simulated soil 17 \nmoisture and surface heat fluxes during summer dry periods were affected by the choice of runoff 18 \nparameterization. 19 \n 20 \n 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 3 \n 1 \n1. Introduction 2 \nLand surface models for use in climate and NWP models have traditionally concentrated on 3 \nthe modeling of the radiative and turbulent fluxes that the atmospheric models require as boundary 4 \nconditions. Further, there has been a tendency to develop relatively sophisticated one-dimensional 5 \nmodels, in which the detail is in the vertical, while ignoring issues of horizontal heterogeneity 6 \nwithin a gridbox [Koster et al., 2000]. Both of these historical factors have tended to mean that the 7 \ngeneration of runoff is treated very simply in land surface models. However, an unrealistic 8 \nsimulation of runoff can have detrimental effects on the simulation of evaporation [Koster and 9 \nMilly, 1997 ] and hence on the partitioning of the surface energy fluxes. Furthermore, researchers 10 \nare making increasing use of coupled models, linking atmosphere, land and ocean, in which runoff 11 \nis a quantity of primary concern. 12 \nThe processes governing the generation of runoff at the scale of a hillslope are complex and 13 \nvary strongly with time and space. Runoff is often considered to be either surface runoff in which 14 \nthe water flows over the land surface, or subsurface runoff. Surface runoff can be divided into that 15 \ngenerated by infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanisms. Infiltration excess runoff occurs 16 \nwhen the rainfall rate is greater than that at which the water can infiltrate into the soil. Rainfall in 17 \nexcess of infiltration will then flow downslope as overland flow towards stream channels. 18 \nSaturation excess overland flow occurs when rain falls onto saturated soil, often in valley bottoms 19 \nand riparian areas. In either case, water that infiltrates the soil will eventually reach a layer of low 20 \npermeability, at which point it becomes a downslope subsurface flow. In many catchments aquifers 21 \nalso contribute to the subsurface flow. 22 \nA coarse resolution land surface model cannot explicitly model the complexities of runoff 23 \ngeneration within a catchment and instead aims to represent the major processes via subgrid 24 \nparameterizations. A popular solution involves the use of probability distribution functions (pdfs) to 25 \nrepresent subgrid variability, usually either a pdf of soil storage capacity [e.g., Dumenil and Todini, 26 \n 4 \n1992; Wood et al., 1992; Liang and Xie, 2001] or of topographic characteristics [e.g., Famiglietti 1 \nand Wood, 1994; Stieglitz et al., 1997; Ducharne et al., 2000; Chen and Kumar, 2001; Gedney and 2 \nCox, 2003]. Both approaches aim to describe the impact of subgrid variability of soil moisture on 3 \nrunoff production. 4 \nIn models that use a pdf of storage capacity, the distribution can be treated as a convenient 5 \nfunctional form, as in the VIC model [Wood et al., 1992], but can also be understood in terms of a 6 \nstatistical distribution of connected soil moisture stores and their overall response to rainfall, as in 7 \nthe Probability Distributed Model (PDM, [Moore, 1985].) The parameters of the distribution can be 8 \nfound from calibration of the overall runoff model, or an attempt can be made to infer them from 9 \nphysical characteristics of the catchment such as topography and soils [Dumenil and Todini, 1992; 10 \nHagemann and Gates, 2003]. The second type of model is based on TOPMODEL  [Beven and 11 \nKirkby, 1979]. The tendency of each location within a catchment to be saturated is estimated using a 12 \ntopographic index \u03bb, defined as )tan\/ln( \u03b2\u03bb a= , where a is the area draining to this location per 13 \nunit contour length and tan\u03b2 is the slope of the land surface. The pdf of \u03bb is used to calculate the 14 \noverall saturated area. Famiglietti and Wood [1994] combined TOPMODEL with a land surface 15 \nmodel, while Stieglitz et al. [1997] developed a simpler version of TOPMODEL for climate models 16 \nand applied the equations to the single soil column that represented the average state of the 17 \ncatchment.  18 \nThe increasing availability of relatively high resolution fields of terrain height has meant that 19 \nparameterizations based on the TOPMODEL approach have been implemented in several models 20 \n[Ducharne et al., 2000; Chen and Kumar, 2001; Habets and Saulnier, 2001; Warrach et al., 2002; 21 \nNiu and Yang, 2003]. Although TOPMODEL is physically-based, many of the assumptions only 22 \nhold in certain catchments or at certain times [Beven, 1997] and must be regarded as poorer 23 \napproximations at the scale of climate models. 24 \nHabets and Saulnier [2001] compared the VIC and TOPMODEL-type approaches and found 25 \nlittle difference in results, but a study by Warrach et al. [2002] found in favor of TOPMODEL. 26 \n 5 \nOther studies have compared a TOPMODEL-type approach with simpler schemes and found that 1 \nthe topographic approach gave better estimates of runoff, with improved subsurface flow again 2 \nbeing important [Stieglitz et al., 1997; Chen and Kumar, 2001]. 3 \nThe land surface model used in the present study is the Met Office Surface Exchange Scheme 4 \n(MOSES, Essery et al., 2003). MOSES has been used with both PDM [Blyth, 2002; Boone et al., 5 \n2004] and TOPMODEL-type parameterizations of runoff [Gedney and Cox, 2003], but a 6 \ncomparison of these has not previously been attempted. The present work was motivated by the 7 \ndesire to identify which parameterization better represented observed river flows and complements 8 \nprevious studies by testing a range of model formulations on the same data and presenting 9 \nsensitivity studies. 10 \nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the model and data 11 \nused, and Section 3 presents results with the standard model. Sections 4 to 6 give the results of 12 \nalternative parameterizations, before Section 7 provides an overall comparison of the models.  13 \n 14 \n 15 \n2. Model, Data and Methodology 16 \n2.1. Description of the Model 17 \n Details of MOSES can be found in Essery et al. [2003], while a few key features will be 18 \nhighlighted here. The soil is divided into vertical layers and moisture fluxes between layers are 19 \nmodeled using a finite difference approximation to the Richards\u2019 equation, with the soil hydraulic 20 \ncharacteristics following Clapp and Hornberger [1978]. Water drains from the bottom of the soil 21 \ncolumn at a rate equal to the hydraulic conductivity of the bottom layer. Surface runoff is generated 22 \nby the infiltration excess mechanism following Dolman and Gregory [1992], assuming an 23 \nexponential distribution of point rainfall rate across the fraction of the catchment where it is raining. 24 \nInfiltration excess runoff is relatively rare on the gridscale of a climate model, and most runoff from 25 \n 6 \nMOSES is via drainage. Alternative parameterizations for runoff generation were introduced, as 1 \ndescribed below, but all other aspects of the model, including the calculation of infiltration excess 2 \nrunoff, were unchanged. 3 \n 4 \n2.2 PDM-based Runoff Scheme 5 \n The Probability Distributed Model (PDM) is described by Moore [1985] and Moore and Bell 6 \n[2002]. In PDM, the distribution of soil storage capacity within a catchment is modeled by a pdf. In 7 \nthis study each catchment was modeled as a single gridbox and the following development uses the 8 \ngridbox mean storage S. As precipitation is added to the soil stores, the smaller stores are the first to 9 \nsaturate. The fraction of the gridbox that is saturated can be shown to be  10 \n1\n0max\n011\n+\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212=\nb\nb\nsat SS\nSSf  11 \nwhere S0 is the minimum storage below which there is no surface saturation, Smax is the maximum 12 \npossible gridbox storage (at saturation) and b is a shape parameter. The interpretation of the value 13 \nof b in terms of the shape of the pdf is discussed by Moore [1985]. Subsequent precipitation on the 14 \nsaturated fraction of the catchment generates surface runoff, which is calculated as shown in the 15 \nAppendix. Surface runoff can be generated before the entire catchment is saturated, and the amount 16 \nof runoff depends in part on the antecedent soil moisture. Note that if S0=0, PDM reduces to the 17 \nform used in several models, including VIC. MOSES_PDM calculated saturation excess surface 18 \nrunoff following PDM and introduced three new parameters. Available data were used to prescribe 19 \nSmax (see Section 4.1), leaving b and S0 to be calibrated.  20 \n 21 \n 7 \n2.3. TOPMODEL-based Runoff Scheme 1 \n For details of the theory underlying TOPMODEL, see Beven and Kirkby [1979] and 2 \nSivapalan et al. [1987]. In TOPMODEL, the spatial variability of soil moisture is parameterized in 3 \nterms of the spatial distribution of \u03bb. The saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, is assumed to 4 \ndecrease with depth beneath the surface (z) as 5 \n \nfz\nss eKzK\n\u2212\n= 0)(  6 \nwhere Ks0 is the saturated conductivity at the soil surface and  f is a decay parameter. Chen 7 \nand Kumar [2001] introduced an anisotropy factor, \u03b1, to account for differences of Ks in the vertical 8 \nand horizontal directions, Ksx= \u03b1 Ksz (hereafter, the subscript z is dropped and Ks refers to the 9 \nvertical direction). Lateral subsurface flow (known as baseflow) occurs at a rate given by 10 \nwfzs\nb eef\nK\nR \u2212\u039b\u2212= 0\n\u03b1\n  (1) 11 \nwhere \u039b and zw are the catchment averages of \u03bb and the depth to the water table respectively. 12 \nGiven zw, the saturated fraction of the catchment can be calculated from the pdf of \u03bb [Beven and 13 \nKirkby, 1979]. For a rainfall rate P (net of interception), saturation excess surface runoff is 14 \ncalculated as 15 \nPfR sats = . 16 \nTOPMODEL was implemented in the current work following the approach of Stieglitz et al. 17 \n[1997], and this version of the model was called MOSES_TOP. There was no drainage though the 18 \nbottom of the soil column and the depth to water table was diagnosed using an equilibrium 19 \nassumption for the soil water at each timestep, following Chen and Kumar [2001]. The baseflow 20 \nwas partitioned between layers beneath the water table according to the transmissivity of each layer. 21 \nSome previous studies [e.g. Chen and Kumar, 2001] calculated evaporation separately for the 22 \n 8 \nsaturated and unsaturated fractions of the catchment, but MOSES_TOP used the gridbox average 1 \nsoil moisture when calculating transpiration. 2 \nMOSES_TOP involved several new parameters. Available data were used to prescribe Ks0 3 \n(see Section 5.2) and the two parameters used to describe the pdf of \u03bb, leaving f and \u03b1 to be 4 \ncalibrated. 5 \n2.4 The Study Area, Data Sources and Methodology  6 \nThis study focuses on three subcatchments of the Rh\u00f4ne basin in southeast France that were 7 \nalso considered as part of the Rh\u00f4ne-AGG experiment [Boone et al., 2004]. Brief details of each are 8 \ngiven in Table 1, while their locations can be seen in Fig.1 of  Boone et al. [2004]. All of the 9 \ncatchments were relatively wet, with annual precipitation in excess of 1200mm and relatively little 10 \nsnowfall. 11 \nLand surface and soil properties were specified as in the Rh\u00f4ne-AGG experiment. 12 \nSimulations with MOSES and MOSES_PDM used four soil layers, with total depth equal to the 13 \nobserved catchment-average (typically 2 to 3 m). Simulations with MOSES_TOP used the same top 14 \nfour layers, but added two deeper layers to take the bottom of the soil column to 10m. Each 15 \ncatchment was represented as a single grid box. The areas of the catchments correspond to a length 16 \nscale of 30-50km, which is sufficiently large to include substantial subgrid variability of surface and 17 \nsoil characteristics. The model was driven by 3-hourly, catchment-average meteorological 18 \nconditions (see Boone et al., 2004). 19 \nModel performance was assessed by comparing simulated and observed streamflow. Only the 20 \ntreatment of runoff in the model was altered, hence some of the error in simulations could be a 21 \nresult of deficiencies in other parameterizations.  MOSES has no representation of runoff routing in 22 \nstreams, but all parts of  the three catchments are closer than one day\u2019s travel to the catchment 23 \noutlet (A.Boone, personal communication, 2003) and the need for explicit consideration of flow 24 \nrouting was avoided by comparing three-day averages of modeled runoff and observed streamflow. 25 \n 9 \nThe model was spun up by repeatedly simulating the period August 1985 to July 1986 until a quasi-1 \nsteady state was obtained. Each integration was then continued for three years to July 1989. 2 \nCalibration used data for August 1986 to July 1987, and August 1987 to July 1989 was used as a 3 \nvalidation period to assess the model performance outside the calibration period. 4 \nThe statistic that is used in most of the analysis that follows is the modeling efficiency [Nash 5 \nand Sutcliffe, 1970], defined as  6 \n( )\n( )\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212= N\ni\ni\nN\ni\nii\nOO\nOM\nE\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1  7 \nwhere Mi denotes a modeled value at time i, Oi an observed value, an overbar indicates the average 8 \nand the sum is over N times. E is a measure of the extent to which the model is an improvement 9 \nover using the average observed flow, with a perfect model giving E=1. The quadratic nature of E 10 \nmeans that it is sensitive to outliers, and mistimed peaks result in substantially lower values. The 11 \nmodel bias ( 0\u2212M ) and mean absolute error (MAE; \u2211\n=\n\u2212\nN\ni\nii OMN\n1\n1 ) are also used below. 12 \nCalibration was performed by specifying a set of values for each parameter, and running the 13 \nmodel for all possible combinations of values. This was considered to give reasonable estimates of 14 \nthe optimal parameter values because the response surfaces were relatively smooth. 15 \n 16 \n3. Simulations with MOSES 17 \nSummary statistics for simulations with MOSES are given in Table 2. On average, MOSES 18 \nproduced more runoff than observed, with a large wet bias in the Ognon. The bias in the Ognon 19 \ncould be reduced by calibrating the soil hydraulic properties, but a substantial bias remained and it 20 \nwas decided to use the soil properties as given for all catchments. 21 \nPrecipitation and observed and modeled streamflow for one year in the Ain are shown in 22 \nFig.1a and b. The modeled flow was dominated by drainage (over 99% of the total), with negligible 23 \n 10 \nsurface runoff. (All runs in the present study produced small amounts of infiltration excess runoff.) 1 \nThe modeled peaks were generally too low and late, consistent with the fact that runoff was largely 2 \ngenerated by drainage through the bottom of the soil column, while there was too much flow during 3 \nrecessions. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for all catchments. 4 \n 5 \n4. Simulations with MOSES_PDM 6 \n4.1 Calibration of MOSES_PDM 7 \nThe pdf of soil storage capacities used in MOSES_PDM is described by the shape parameter 8 \nb and the storage parameters S0 and Smax. Smax was set to \u03b8sat zpdm, where \u03b8sat is the volumetric 9 \nmoisture content at saturation. zpdm is the depth over which soil moisture is considered for PDM and 10 \nwas taken to be 1m. The model was calibrated for each catchment by varying b between 0 and 10, 11 \nand S0\/Smax between 0 and 1. The optimal parameter values are given in Table 3, while Fig.2 12 \nillustrates the E values. In this figure, MOSES and then three runs of MOSES_PDM are shown for 13 \neach catchment (the runs with TOPMODEL are considered later). The MOSES_PDM runs are: (1) 14 \nPDM_0: the best calibrated model with the constraint that S0 was zero (2) PDM_calib: the best 15 \ncalibrated model for each catchment (3) PDM_best: the single pair of parameter values that, when 16 \nused for all catchments, gave the best results averaged over the three catchments. In the remainder 17 \nof this work, such a \u201cbest\u201d set of values is termed a \u201cbest overall\u201d set. The final group in this figure, 18 \nlabeled \u201caverage\u201d, shows the efficiency averaged over the three catchments. (Note that in Fig.2, E 19 \nfor PDM_calib in the Ognon is less than that for the best overall model because E is given for the 20 \nvalidation period, not the calibration period.) 21 \nFor the Ain and Ardeche, MOSES_PDM performed substantially better than MOSES. The 22 \nfinal set of results in Fig.2 confirms that, on average, MOSES_PDM performed substantially better 23 \nthan MOSES. On average, restricting the model to S0=0 (PDM_0, as used in VIC) still resulted in 24 \nconsiderable improvement over MOSES, but non-zero values of S0 gave better results. It was not 25 \n 11 \nsurprising that adding a parameter allowed better simulations, but non-zero values of S0 also make 1 \nphysical sense, as discussed below. The best overall model (PDM_best) had parameter values 2 \nS0\/Smax=0\u00b775,  b=10. 3 \nThe modeled streamflow for the Ain, using the \u201cbest overall\u201d parameters, is shown in Fig.1c. 4 \nComparison with the MOSES results (Fig.1b) shows that the timing of the peaks was better 5 \nsimulated by MOSES_PDM, but the peaks remained low. Fig.1d shows that subsurface drainage 6 \nwas dominant (over 75%), with saturation excess surface runoff contributing to the peaks. 7 \nMOSES_PDM also showed excessive flow during recessions, consistent with the fact that drainage 8 \nwas simulated in the same way as by MOSES. The lower infiltration with PDM was largely 9 \nbalanced by reduced drainage, and total runoff was very similar between runs with and without 10 \nPDM. 11 \n4.2 Sensitivity of MOSES_PDM 12 \nThe sensitivity of MOSES_PDM to parameter values is illustrated by the whiskers shown 13 \nnext to PDM_best in Fig.2. These show the effects of varying S0 by \u00b110% about its value in the best 14 \noverall model. The sensitivity to b was too small to be plotted in this way. In every catchment, the 15 \nsensitivity was sufficiently small as to mean that the \u201cbest overall\u201d parameters gave better results 16 \nthan MOSES. 17 \nThese results are best interpreted with the help of Fig.3, which shows the response surface for 18 \nthe Ain. Small values of  S0 meant that nearly every rainfall event would result in surface runoff, in 19 \nwhich case b<1 was best (relatively more larger stores \u2013 see Moore [1985]) since this gave a 20 \nsmaller saturated fraction and reduced the size of the runoff peaks. The highest efficiency was 21 \nfound with S0\/Smax ~0.7, meaning that no saturation excess runoff was generated until the soil was 22 \n70% saturated. This gave good results by generating surface runoff to augment large peaks of 23 \nstreamflow when the catchment was very wet, while not generating any surface runoff over a drier 24 \ncatchment. This seems reasonable, since for many dry catchments one would expect there to be 25 \n 12 \nlittle or no saturated area (outside channels) and a rainfall event could all be absorbed by the soil 1 \nwithout any surface runoff. S0\/Smax ~0.7 favoured larger values of b (relatively more small stores) 2 \nsince these tend to give more runoff during the peak flows. As small b or large S0 increased the ratio 3 \nof subsurface to surface runoff, the best runs in Fig.3 were all dominated by subsurface flow. 4 \nThe simpler parameterization with S0=0 was very sensitive to b and an advantage of allowing 5 \nlarger values of the threshold S0 was that this sensitivity was reduced, particularly for S0\/Smax ~0.7. 6 \nIn all catchments the response surface of E showed slow variation around the optimum. This meant 7 \nthat the simulation for a given catchment was not critically dependent upon the exact parameter 8 \nvalues and, more importantly, it was possible to identify a \u201cbest overall\u201d set of parameters.  9 \n4.3 A Priori Estimation of Parameter Values for MOSES_PDM 10 \nThe values of b can be set by calibration  [e.g. Warrach et al., 2002] or may be considered 11 \nconstant over all catchments [e.g. Habets et al., 1999]. Other studies have attempted to link the 12 \nparameters of PDM-like models to physical characteristics. Dumenil and Todini [1992 ] calculated 13 \nb as a simple function of the subgrid standard deviation of elevation, so that hilly terrain gave a 14 \nlarger value of b and would tend to give more runoff. Hagemann and Gates [2003] used a soil 15 \ndataset to characterize the subgrid distribution of soil storage and fitted a pdf to this.  16 \nIn the present work, the relatively low sensitivity of MOSES_PDM to parameter values meant 17 \nthat both methods for estimating values a priori gave reasonable results. However, better results 18 \nwere obtained by using a single set of calibrated parameters for all catchments. Moreover, both a 19 \npriori methods are potentially sensitive to the resolution of the data used. More catchments would 20 \nneed to be studied to determine if there is any useful relationship between parameter values and 21 \ncatchment characteristics, and in the meantime we propose to use the \u201cbest overall\u201d parameters for 22 \nall catchments. 23 \n 24 \n 25 \n 13 \n5. Simulations with MOSES_TOP 1 \n5.1 Estimation of parameters of the topographic index 2 \nThe pdf of \u03bb for each catchment was modeled as a two-parameter gamma distribution, using 3 \nthe HYDRO1K global dataset (http:\/\/edc.usgs.gov\/products\/elevation\/gtopo30\/hydro) to calculate 4 \nthe mean (\u039b) and standard deviation (\u03c3\u03bb) of \u03bb for each catchment. These statistics are sensitive to 5 \nthe resolution of the elevation data used [e.g., Wolock and Price, 1994; Zhang and Montgomery, 6 \n1994; Saulnier et al., 1997; Kumar et al., 2000; Wolock and McCabe, 2000; Ibbitt and Woods, 7 \n2004; Bormann, 2006; Pradhan et al., 2006]. Generally \u039b decreases as finer resolution data are 8 \nused, while Kumar et al. [2000] showed that \u03c3\u03bb also decreases. For global or other large-scale 9 \napplications, data on a 1 km grid (such as HYDRO1K) are often used, but Ibbitt and Woods [2004] 10 \nsuggested that data at much greater resolution would be required to estimate the \u201ctrue\u201d value. Figure 11 \n4 summarises the results of several published estimates of how \u039b varies with grid size. These 12 \nstudies have considered different locations and there is considerable scatter between the results. In 13 \ngeneral there appears to be a modest decrease of \u039b down to grid sizes of the order of 100m, with a 14 \nmuch larger rate of decrease for smaller grid sizes. Ibbitt and Woods [2004] and Pradhan et al. 15 \n[2006 ] have considered how a theory for downscaling might be developed, but as yet there is no 16 \nrobust method with which to adjust \u039b.  17 \nFar from it being the case that \u039b has a value that can be defined via readily-available 18 \ntopographic data, the value of \u039b is highly uncertain. Some studies authors have acknowledged the 19 \nscale-dependence of \u039b, and have attempted to correct for it. For example, Chen and Kumar [2001] 20 \ndownscaled from 1km to 90m, while Niu and Yang [2003] downscaled from 1km to 100m. 21 \nHowever, Fig.4 suggests that estimates of \u039b may continue to vary to much smaller scales. This 22 \nuncertainty in \u039b is important because, as will be shown later, variations in \u039b\n \nof this size can result 23 \nin substantially different model performance.  24 \n 14 \nIn the current work, the simple relationship \u039b= \u039b1000-5 was to used to calculate \u039b from the 1 \nHYDRO1K value of \u039b1000. This arbitrary rule was intended to capture some of the behaviour shown 2 \nin Fig.4 as the grid size decreases from 1km to of the order of 10m. Implicit in this approach was 3 \nthe assumption that there is a \u201ccorrect\u201d value of \u039b, which might be determined with high resolution 4 \ndata. This gave values of 7\u00b76, 6\u00b70 and 7\u00b73 for the Ain, Ardeche and Ognon respectively. No attempt 5 \nwas made to account for the effect of data resolution on \u03c3\u03bb. The calculated values of \u039b are clearly 6 \nsubject to large uncertainty and the sensitivity of the models to the value of \u039b is explored below. 7 \n5.2 Calibration of MOSES_TOP 8 \nExisting global datasets generally do not contain enough information to specify a vertical 9 \nprofile of Ks. Previous studies have adopted a variety of approaches to relate a given value of Ks to a 10 \nsurface value (Ks0) and the decay parameter f [Stieglitz et al., 1997; Chen and Kumar, 2001; 11 \nWarrach et al., 2002; Decharme et al., 2006]. For the current work, the value of Ks that was 12 \nprovided for each catchment was assumed to be the average down to a depth of 2m (results were not  13 \nparticularly sensitive to this depth). The value of Ks0 was then calculated for each value of f. This 14 \nresulted in relatively large values of Ks close to the surface, consistent with the existence of 15 \nmacropores and less compacted soil in these layers. 16 \nMOSES_TOP was calibrated by varying f over the range 1 to 9, and \u03b1 over the range 1 to 100. 17 \nThis range of \u03b1  was motivated by results in the literature. Chen and Kumar [2001] used a value of 18 \n2000, found by calibration, while Niu and Yang [2003] used values in the range 10-20. In a review 19 \nof published results, largely from laboratory and pumping tests, Kumar [2004] noted values in the 20 \nrange of 0\u00b74 to 562, with most studies suggesting a maximum of less than 100. 21 \nThe calibrated parameter values are shown in Table 4. Again, it was possible to identify a 22 \nsingle set of parameters that gave good results in all catchments: f=3\u00b70, \u03b1=100. The values of f 23 \nfound by calibration were of the order of 3-4 and were broadly consistent with those found in 24 \nprevious modeling studies [Stieglitz et al., 1997; Chen and Kumar, 2001; Warrach et al., 2002; Niu 25 \n 15 \nand Yang, 2003; Decharme et al., 2006], and certainly within the wide range found by Beven [1982] 1 \nin observations. The last line in Table 4 shows that the decision to restrict \u03b1 to values of 100 or less 2 \ndid not drastically affect the results. 3 \nThe last two bars in each section of Figure 2 represent E for MOSES_TOP calibrated for each 4 \ncatchment, and MOESES_TOP with \u201cbest overall\u201d parameters. Simulations with MOSES_TOP 5 \nwere better than those with MOSES in all catchments, particularly the Ain and Ardeche. The 6 \nsimulated hydrograph shown in Fig.1e confirms that the timing and size of peak flows were well 7 \ncaptured by MOSES_TOP, and recessions were also generally well matched. Figure 1f shows that 8 \nthe optimal parameters resulted in runoff that consisted largely of subsurface flow (84%). Although 9 \nMOSES and MOSES_TOP were both dominated by subsurface flow, the more rapid variations of 10 \nMOSES_TOP compared much more favorably with the observed streamflow.  11 \n5.3 Sensitivity of  MOSES_TOP 12 \nThe sensitivity of MOSES_TOP to the values of f and \u03b1 is illustrated for the Ain in Fig.5a. 13 \nWith f=3, using \u03b1=1 gave simulations that were much too \u2018flashy\u2019 due to low baseflow and a large 14 \nsaturated fraction. A better match to observations was found with larger values of \u03b1 which gave 15 \nincreased baseflow and smaller saturated fraction. Sensitivity to \u03b1 was small for \u03b1\u2265200, but was 16 \nmuch greater when \u03b1 was in the range suggested as physically plausible, namely \u03b1~100. (This result 17 \nis sensitive to the value of \u039b \u2013 see below). 18 \nLarger values of f gave faster decrease of Ks with depth, which tended to produce a higher 19 \nwater table (i.e. closer to the surface) and greater baseflow. With \u03b1=2000, using f=1 gave a lower 20 \nwater table but low flows were too high and peaks too low. f=8 meant the low flows were too small, 21 \nbut the column could wet up quickly, giving large saturated fraction and peak flows that were too 22 \ngreat. Hence an intermediate value of f gave best results (Fig.5a). 23 \nThe model\u2019s sensitivity to \u039b is summarized in Fig5b, which shows E as a function of \u2206\u039b1000, 24 \nthe amount subtracted from \u039b1000. Increasing \u039b decreases baseflow by Eq.1 and gives a higher 25 \n 16 \nwater table. Figure 5b shows that for f=3, \u03b1 =1000, sensitivity to \u039b was low for values of \u2206\u039b1000<-1 \n2. For \u03b1 =100, \u2206\u039b1000<-5 was required and the standard runs (\u2206\u039b1000=-5) lay in this regime. For 2 \n\u03b1=1, \u2206\u039b1000\u2248-10 (c.f. average \u039b1000=11.6) was required to get similarly large E values. This 3 \nparameter interdependency is considered further in the next section. 4 \n5.4 Interplay Between Parameters of  MOSES_TOP 5 \nPrevious studies with TOPMODEL noted that the same runoff could be obtained in 6 \nsimulations with different values of \u039b, as long as the transmissivity values were adjusted 7 \nappropriately [Franchini et al., 1996; Saulnier et al., 1997]. For TOPMODEL, the problem was 8 \noften approached in terms of how to adjust \u039b so that values of Ks0 found by calibration could be 9 \napplied in models of different gridbox size. In the present work, Ks0 was set using soil data and in 10 \nthat sense was removed from the problem. However, the introduction of \u03b1 means that the terms \u03b1 11 \nand e-\u039b in Eq.1 can show similar compensation, assuming the same depth to water table. That is, 12 \nconsidering two simulations with identical values of f, Ks0 and zw, but the first uses (\u039b1, \u03b11) while 13 \nthe second has the distinct values (\u039b2, \u03b12), Eq.1 shows that the same runoff will result if 14 \n\u03b12= \u03b11 exp(\u039b2- \u039b1)     (2). 15 \nFranchini et al. [1996] show that the assumption of equal zw is generally valid for TOPMODEL, 16 \nand comparisons of simulations confirmed that Eq.2 was also a good approximation for 17 \nMOSES_TOP across a wide range of parameter space. This compensation between parameters 18 \nexplains the family of curves seen in Fig.5b, with the maximum E found at smaller \u039b as \u03b1 19 \ndecreases. The large values of \u03b1 that were found by calibration in Chen and Kumar[2001] may, in 20 \npart, have been necessary to adjust for insufficient downscaling of \u039b.. 21 \nThe TOPMODEL-type parameterization used here is, in some senses, over-parameterized. 22 \nThe values of \u03b1 and \u039b are highly uncertain, and there is compensation between them. This 23 \nmotivated Niu and Yang [2003] to develop an alternative parameterization, which is described in 24 \nSection 6.2 below. 25 \n 17 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n6. Alternative TOPMODEL-type Parameterizations 4 \nThe previous section established that a parameterization based on TOPMODEL gave the best 5 \nsimulations of runoff. TOPMODEL has been implemented in a variety of ways in land surface 6 \nmodels. This section considers the sensitivity of our model to aspects of the parameterization. 7 \n6.1 Description of MOSES_TOPgc 8 \nGedney and Cox [2003] implemented TOPMODEL in MOSES assuming that the exponential 9 \nprofile of Ks only held below the bottom of the standard soil model at 3m. The standard soil layers 10 \nwere augmented by a deeper layer in which a simplified treatment of soil water was used. In the 11 \npresent work, tests showed that this model was relatively unresponsive because the soil moisture in 12 \nthe deep layer was assumed to all lie below the water table, with a dry layer between this and the 13 \nbottom of the standard soil model. To produce a more realistic response of the water table, the 14 \nmoisture distribution in the deep layer was taken to be in equilibrium with the drainage at the 15 \nbottom of the standard soil model. This modified version was used here as MOSES_TOPgc 16 \nMOSES_TOP and MOSES_TOPgc differed in terms of the vertical variation of Ks and in the 17 \nnumber of soil layers. Both required the parameters f and \u03b1 to be calibrated, and \u039b was set to \u039b1000-18 \n5.  19 \n 20 \n6.2 Description of MOSES_TOPsim 21 \nNiu and Yang [2003] and Niu et al. [2005] described a model called SIMTOP that was 22 \ninspired by the form of  TOPMODEL, but was considered simpler. In the present study, this model 23 \nwas implemented as MOSES_TOPsim. The saturated fraction was calculated as 24 \n 18 \n)exp(max wsat cfzff \u2212=  1 \nwhere fmax is the saturated fraction when the mean depth to the water table is zero, and can be found 2 \nas the fraction of the catchment with \u03bb\u2265\u039b. The value of c was found by fitting an exponential 3 \ndistribution to that part of the pdf with \u03bb\u2265\u039b, where an exponential often gives a good fit [Woods 4 \nand Sivapalan, 1997; Niu et al., 2005]. Subsurface runoff is calculated as 5 \n \nwfz\nbb eRR\n\u2212\n= max  (3) 6 \nwhere the parameter Rbmax is the subsurface runoff when the depth to the water table is zero. Niu et 7 \nal. 2005] considered that the advantage of using Eq.3 rather than Eq.1 to calculate Rb was that the 8 \nsingle, entirely calibrated term Rbmax replaced the product of \u03b1, Ks0, 1\/f and e-\u039b.  9 \nMOSES_TOPsim was implemented with four soil layers down to the depth given in the soil 10 \ndataset. In all other respects, MOSES_TOPsim followed MOSES_TOP.  11 \n6.3 Calibration of MOSES_TOPgc and MOSES_TOPsim 12 \n Table 4 shows that, after calibration, MOSES_TOPgc performed slightly better than 13 \nMOSES_TOP. MOSES_TOPgc, for which Ks decays only in the deep layer, favored higher values 14 \nof f which reduced Ks more quickly in the deep layer. Sensitivity to parameter values was also 15 \nsimilar in each model (not shown). In summary, the modifications of Gedney and Cox [2003] 16 \nappear to have largely retained the functioning of a model based on Stieglitz et al. [1997]. 17 \nMOSES_TOPsim was calibrated by varying f in the range 0 to 8, and Rbmax over 0\u00b75-10\u00d710-4 18 \nkg m-2 s-1. Table 4 shows that this version of the model could be calibrated to give statistics very 19 \nsimilar to those of MOSES_TOP and MOSES_TOPgc. The optimum value of f =3 was similar to 20 \nthat found by Niu et al. [2005], while Rbmax=1.0\u00d710-3 kg m-2 s-1 was slightly larger, although 21 \ndifferent catchments were studied. Again, the optimum parameters meant more subsurface runoff 22 \n(89%) than surface runoff. By equating Eq.1 and Eq.3, using f=3 and other values appropriate to the 23 \n 19 \ncatchments, we find that Rbmax=1.0\u00d710-3 kg m-2 s-1 is equivalent to \u03b1\u2248250 on average, which is 1 \ncomparable to the values used for MOSES_TOP. 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n7. Intercomparison of models 5 \n7.1 Runoff 6 \nThe ability of each model to simulate the observed streamflow is summarized in Table 5, 7 \nwhile values of E can be compared in Fig.2. In Table 5, values shown are for the best overall 8 \nparameter values for each model (that is, the parameter values that when used in all catchments 9 \ngave the largest E averaged over all catchments). For E and MAE, all of the parameterizations 10 \nscored better than the original MOSES. The best models were MOSES_TOPgc and 11 \nMOSES_TOPsim. Similar results held for the bias, although MOSES_TOP actually increased the 12 \nbias. The fact that all statistics tended to improve while calibration considered only E, increases our 13 \nconfidence that the new models are a real improvement. The sensitivity of the calibrated models to 14 \nchanges in parameters around the optima was also broadly similar \u2013 as shown in Fig.2 for 15 \nMOSES_PDM and MOSES_TOP. 16 \nIn view of the remaining uncertainties, and the likelihood of variations between catchments, 17 \nall the TOPMODEL-type parameterizations can be considered to belong to a \u201ctop group\u201d that 18 \nperformed best. The fact that all the TOPMODEL-type formulations can be calibrated to perform 19 \nsimilarly is not surprising, given that the process representation is very similar in each. The 20 \nTOPMODEL approach gave subsurface runoff that could vary more rapidly than the formulation 21 \nused in MOSES and MOSES_PDM. The longer term behavior in recessions was also captured 22 \nbetter, as shown by the autocorrelation of streamflow, which is shown for the Ain in Fig.6. That is, 23 \nthe alternative formulation of subsurface flow in the TOPMODEL-type models was crucial to their 24 \nsuperiority, with a lesser contribution from the saturation excess surface flow (although the two are 25 \n 20 \nintimately linked). At the scale of these catchments (>1000 km2) it is quite possible that, outside of 1 \nthe stream network, subsurface flow is dominant. 2 \nWhile the TOPMODEL group introduced alternative ways of calculating both surface and 3 \nsubsurface runoff, MOSES_PDM represented an intermediate class in which only the calculation of 4 \nsurface runoff was altered from MOSES. Consistent with this, results were intermediate between 5 \nthose of MOSES and the TOPMODEL group, although E values were close to those of the latter. 6 \nFor MOSES_PDM, the inclusion of saturation excess surface runoff during rain events greatly 7 \nimproved the simulation of peak flows. The contribution of surface runoff meant MOSES \u2013PDM 8 \nshowed more variation than MOSES over timescales of a few days, but at longer timescales the 9 \ncurve for MOSES_PDM relaxes back onto that for MOSES (Fig. 6), because both simulated 10 \ndrainage in the same way. It seems likely that the performance of MOSES and MOSES_PDM could 11 \nbe improved by altering the representation of subsurface drainage (and calibrating any additional 12 \nparameters), but this was not investigated here. 13 \nThe new parameterizations tended to perform better than MOSES in the Ain and Ardeche, but 14 \ntheir superiority was less marked in the Ognon. In the Ain and Ardeche, the correlation of 15 \nprecipitation and streamflow was greatest when streamflow was lagged by one day (not shown). In 16 \nthe Ognon, the maximum correlation occurred with a lag of 3 days. This simple result could be 17 \ninfluenced by several factors, but suggests a difference between the catchments. The nature of this 18 \ndifference is unknown, but possible factors are that the Ognon has extensive limestone and karst 19 \n[BRGM, 1970, although some is also present in the Ain], and is also the flattest catchment studied. 20 \n 21 \n7.2 Soil water and energy balance 22 \nThe catchments studied here were relatively wet and the various parameterizations tested had 23 \nrelatively little impact on the total runoff or evaporation: soil evaporation was rarely limited by 24 \nmoisture availability and changes in surface runoff were largely balanced by opposite changes in 25 \n 21 \nthe subsurface. However, moisture stress became more important in drier summers and then the 1 \ncalculated turbulent fluxes were sensitive to the parameterization of subgrid variability. Figure 7a 2 \nshow the soil wetness (expressed as a fraction of saturation) in the top 1m of soil for the Ardeche 3 \ncatchment during part of 1986. (MOSES, MOSES_PDM and MOSES_TOPgc simulated similar 4 \nsoil wetness during this period, so only MOSES is shown. Similarly, MOSES_TOPsim was similar 5 \nto MOSES_TOP.) In MOSES, the period of vegetation stress started a month earlier and lasted 6 \nlonger than with MOSES_TOP, with substantial impacts on the modeled evaporation (Fig.7b). 7 \nCumulative evaporation was 28% greater in MOSES_TOP over the period June to September 1984 8 \nwhile sensible heat was 31% lower (not shown). Differences of this magnitude would have 9 \nsubstantial impact on an atmospheric model: if this average heat flux difference was assumed to 10 \noccur over 12 hours of daytime and to diverge in a 1km deep boundary layer, the temperature 11 \ndifference would be ~1.3K. 12 \nAlthough all the TOPMODEL-based models were calibrated to give similar performance for 13 \nrunoff, their internal state variables often had rather different values. For example, during the period 14 \nshown in Fig.7 the water table was on average 1.4m deeper in MOSES_TOPgc than in 15 \nMOSES_TOP, as a result of differences in parameterization and parameter values. Although this 16 \ndifference was not significant to the present work, it could be important for other processes, for 17 \nexample trace gas emission over wetlands. 18 \n 19 \n8. Discussion 20 \n When calibrated, both the PDM and TOPMODEL-type approaches perform better than the 21 \nstandard MOSES model which has no representation of subgrid soil moisture variability. The 22 \nTOPMODEL-type approach is found to be superior over three catchments of the size of a typical 23 \ngridbox in an atmospheric model. This is in agreement with the findings of Warrach et al.[2002] for 24 \na single, small catchment. The similar forms and results of the TOPMODEL-type parameterizations 25 \nsuggest that any of these models could be used, but this result will have to be confirmed for other 26 \n 22 \nenvironments. The PDM and TOPMODEL-TYPE approaches have optimum parameter values that 1 \ndo not vary much for the three catchments studied, suggesting that detailed calibration may not be 2 \nrequired for every catchment. 3 \nFor models using a PDM-like approach, Dumenil and Todini [1992] and Hagemann and 4 \nGates [2003] have suggested how the parameters can be related to catchment characteristics, but 5 \nthese require further investigation and most studies have calibrated the parameters. 6 \nIn principle, an attractive feature of TOPMODEL is that readily-available elevation data can 7 \nbe used to define an important input, namely the pdf of \u03bb. However, many studies have shown that 8 \nthe pdf is sensitive to the resolution of the data, and so even the topographic parameters are 9 \nuncertain. This uncertainty has led some to abandon or revise the use of \u03bb in their models [Niu et 10 \nal., 2005; Decharme et al., 2006]. In the present work, compensation between parameters meant 11 \nthat the importance of uncertainty in \u03bb varied with the value of \u03b1. In the present study, the approach 12 \ntaken was to adjust \u039b (broadly in line with that suggested by scaling studies) and calibrate \u03b1 within 13 \nthe range suggested as physically reasonable. The robustness of this procedure will be investigated 14 \nin future work. Users of TOPMODEL-type models must be aware of the uncertainty in \u03bb and its 15 \npossible impact on their model and its calibration. 16 \nDespite the large uncertainty in global fields of \u03bb, there does appear to be useful information 17 \nin this data. For example, our unpublished work shows significant correlations between HYDRO1K 18 \n\u03bb and observed extent of inundation. Thus although the absolute value of \u03bb is uncertain, it might be 19 \npossible to employ a relatively simple downscaling or correction method, and retain useful 20 \ninformation about spatial variability.  21 \nThe large uncertainty in parameter values for the models studied suggests that some 22 \ncalibration is currently essential for models of runoff generation. The need to calibrate a model is 23 \nnot necessarily a major obstacle to global implementation if, as was the case here, the model is not 24 \nvery sensitive to variations of parameter values around the optimum values. Further, Gulden et al. 25 \n[2007] suggest that a suitable choice of hydrological parameterization can reduce the sensitivity of a 26 \n 23 \nmodel to poor choices of uncertain parameter values, although which of the schemes tested here 1 \nwould fare best in that respect has not been examined. 2 \nAlthough it is tempting to relate all these models, and in particular those based on 3 \nTOPMODEL, to processes that occur on the scale of a small catchment, they are all highly 4 \nsimplified representations of reality. Particularly at larger scales, the parameterizations may be 5 \nbetter thought of as convenient functional forms that capture some of the essential dynamics of 6 \ncatchments. 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n9. Conclusions 10 \nThe impact of different parameterizations of runoff generation in the MOSES land surface 11 \nmodel was tested using observed streamflow from three mesoscale catchments. Parameterizations 12 \nbased on the Probability Distributed Model (PDM) and TOPMODEL were implemented. Runoff in 13 \nthe standard MOSES is dominated by drainage which varies too slowly to match the observed 14 \nstreamflow. MOSES_PDM added a representation of saturation excess surface runoff to the 15 \nstandard model, while the TOPMODEL-based models additionally altered the representation of 16 \nsubsurface runoff. After calibration, the alternative parameterizations performed considerably better 17 \nthan the standard model. The best results were found using any of the parameterizations based on 18 \nTOPMODEL, which were better because they allowed the subsurface runoff to vary more quickly, 19 \nwith smaller volumes of surface runoff contributing to flow peaks. Although all the new models 20 \nrequired extra calibration, a single set of parameter values was identified for each that could be used 21 \nin all catchments with results comparable to those found from calibration. Attention was drawn to 22 \nuncertainty in the value of the topographic index, which is an important parameter in TOPMODEL-23 \ntype models. The simulation of turbulent fluxes during dry periods was sensitive to the choice of 24 \nparameterization, which would be important when coupled to an atmospheric model. 25 \n 24 \nOur future work aims to extend this work to other environments, and to investigate the use of 1 \ncatchment characteristics for estimating parameters a priori. We also intend to investigate the use of 2 \nremote sensing products for the assessment of runoff parameterizations, particularly moisture stress 3 \n[e.g. Anderson et al., 2007], inundation and wetland extent [e.g. Prigent et al., 2001]  and changes 4 \nin terrestrial water storage [e.g. Niu et al., 2007]. 5 \n 25 \nAcknowledgements 1 \nThis work was supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and the UK 2 \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under the Climate Prediction Programme 3 \nPECD 7\/12\/37.
