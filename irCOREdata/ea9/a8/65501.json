Possible explana-\ntions include an increase in sedentary lifestyles\nand changes in dietary patterns and eating\nhabits.7 Among adults it appears that average\nrecorded energy intake in Britain has declined\nsubstantially as obesity rates have escalated,\nwhich may suggest that sedentary lifestyles are\nan important factor.8 9\nObesity in childhood can cause dyslipidaemia,\nhyperinsulinaemia, and hypertension.10 Addition-\nally, the first obesity related cases of type 2\ndiabetes in white adolescents have been reported\nin the UK.11 Overweight and obesity are also\nknown to have a significant impact on psycho-\nlogical wellbeing with many children developing\na negative self-image and experiencing low self-\nesteem.12 13\nHalting the rising prevalence of overweight and\nobesity in children is a public health priority,14 and\nthere are now a number of government initiatives\nspecifically targeting schools and school\nchildren.15\u201318 Additionally, guidelines on the\nweight management of children and adolescents\nin primary care have been published by the Royal\nCollege of Pediatrics and Child Health in conjunc-\ntion with the National Obesity Forum,19 and are\nforthcoming from the Scottish Intercollegiate\nGuidelines Network.20\nBased upon updated Cochrane reviews,21 22 this\npaper focuses on the effectiveness of interven-\ntions in the prevention and treatment of child-\nhood obesity. The Cochrane review on prevention\nincluded non-randomised studies, but this paper\nfocuses exclusively on randomised controlled\ntrials (RCTs). Only studies with over 20 partici-\npants have been reported in the text, but the\nresults of all 35 included RCTs are reported in\ntables 1\u20133.\nEFFECTIVENESS\nSchool based programmes (table 1)\nHealth promotion\nOne school based RCT (n=227) assessed the\neffects of using a classroom based curriculum to\nreduce television, videotape, and video game use\non changes in physical activity, dietary intake,\nand obesity (adiposity).23 At 7 months follow up\nthe children in the intervention group (n=106)\nwere found to watch significantly less television\nand to play fewer video games than children in\nthe control group. Children in the intervention\ngroup also had statistically significant decreases\nin body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold thick-\nness, waist circumference, and waist to hip ratio\ncompared with the control group.\nPhysical activity\nIn the first RCT (n=310), trained staff encour-\naged infant school classes (mean age 4.5 years) to\ntake part in a 30 week exercise programme.24 At\nthe end of the programme there were no statisti-\ncally significant differences between children\nwho exercised and those in the control group,\nalthough the prevalence of obesity decreased in\nboth groups of children.\nThe second RCT evaluated a physical education\nprogramme (project SPARK) designed to provide\nhigh levels of exercise for children in three 30\nminute sessions per week over an 18 month\nperiod.25 The children in the two exercise groups\nwere led by either specialist PE teachers or class-\nroom teachers. At the end of the programme there\nwere no statistically significant differences in the\nlevels of obesity between those in the exercise\ngroup and those in the control group.\nMultifaceted interventions\nThe Active Programme Promoting Lifestyle in\nschools (APPLES) RCT (n=636) included chil-\ndren aged 7\u201311 years.26 The programme consisted\nof teacher training, modification of school meals,\nthe development of school action plans targeting\nthe curriculum, physical education, tuck shops,\nand playground activities, and was compared\nwith a no intervention control group. Ten primary\nschools were randomised and at 1 year there was\nno difference in change in BMI scores between\nthe two groups. The APPLES programme had\nlittle effect on children\u2019s eating behaviour other\nthan a modest increase in the consumption of\nvegetables.\nThe Kiel Obesity Prevention Study (KOPS) was\na primary school based intervention which\nassessed the additional impact of a family based\nprogramme for obese children or normal weight\nchildren with obese parents (n=297).27 This RCT\nSee end of article for\nauthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nP Wilson, NHS Centre for\nReviews & Dissemination,\nUniversity of York York\nYO10 5DD, UK;\npmw7@york.ac.uk\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n65\nwww.qshc.com\n group.bmj.com on November 5, 2009 - Published by qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nTable 1 RCTs evaluating school based programmes\nReference Participants Intervention, duration Results Comments\nHealth promotion\nRobinson23 (USA,\n1999)\nSchool children (grades\n3\u20134)\nMean age: 8.9 years\n% female: not given\nI: An 18-lesson, 6-month classroom curriculum to reduce television,\nvideotape, and videogame use (n=106)\nC: Usual school curriculum (n=121)\nFollow up: 7 months\nAdjusted change in BMI (kg\/m2) \u20130.45 (95% CI \u20130.73 to\n\u2013-0.17, p=0.002)\nSignificantly greater reductions were also observed in the I\ngroup in terms of triceps skinfold thickness (p=0.002), waist\ncircumference (p<0.001) and waist-to-hip ratio (p<0.001)\nIntervention group children watched significantly less television\n(p<0.001) and played fewer video games (p<0.01) than control\ngroup children.

Control children received no intervention. At 1 year\nthere were no significant differences in mean BMI scores\nbetween the two groups.\nA large RCT (n=1295) involving the multi-faceted \u201cPlanet\nHealth\u201d programme targeted older children (aged 11\u201313\nyears).28 This programme promoted physical activity,modifica-\ntion of dietary intake, and reduction of sedentary behaviours.\nControl schools received their usual health curricula and\nphysical education classes. After 18 months the prevalence of\nobesity among girls in the intervention schools was reduced\ncompared with controls (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.93;\np=0.03). In addition, there were fewer obese girls in the inter-\nvention group than in the control group (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.07\nto 4.35; p=0.04). The programme significantly reduced televi-\nsion viewing hours for both boys and girls.\nA much smaller RCT (n=43) assessed whether a \u201cDance for\nHealth\u201d programme had a greater impact on increasing aero-\nbic capacity, maintaining or decreasing weight, and improving\nattitudes towards fitness than usual physical education\n(n=38).29 At the end of the programme there was a\nstatistically significant decrease in BMI and change in heart\nrate for girls in the intervention group compared with those in\nthe control group. There were no statistically significant\ndifferences between the groups for boys.\nFamily based interventions (table 2)\nHealth promotion\nIn one RCT (n=55) an obesity prevention programme (which\nstressed the importance of eating a low fat, low cholesterol\ndiet and increasing activity) was compared with a control\ngroup that took part in a general health education\nprogramme.30 At the end of the 12 week study there was a sta-\ntistically significant difference in favour of the intervention in\nterms of the percentage of daily calories from fat.\nIn a second RCT, 26 families with non-obese children who\nhad obese parents were randomised to groups that encour-\naged fruit and vegetable intake or decreased intake of high\nfat\/high sugar foods.31 At 1 year follow up there was a signifi-\ncantly greater decrease in percentage overweight in favour of\nparents in the increased fruit and vegetable group, but no sig-\nnificant between group differences in percentage overweight\nfor children.\nA third RCT (n=185) compared two types of intervention\n(routine general information leaflet versus enhanced infor-\nmation about a specific diet, physical activity, active parental\ncommitment, and food diary) delivered by family paediatri-\ncians in primary care (table2).32 At 1 year follow up, although\nboth intervention groups showed a reduction in percentage\noverweight from baseline, the reduction was significantly\ngreater in the enhanced information group than in the routine\ninformation group.\nPhysical activity and health promotion\nIn one RCT (n=53) dietary education was compared with\ndietary education plus exercise and (for the first s6months\nonly) a waiting list control.33 At 12 months a statistically sig-\nnificant decrease in terms of percentage overweight from\nbaseline was found for both intervention groups, but there\nwere no differences between the two groups. In a second RCT\n(n=23) comparing dietary education with dietary education\nplus exercise, statistically significant decreases in percentage\noverweight from baseline were observed for both groups.34 At\n6 months (but not 12 months) follow up the dietary education\nplus exercise group showed a statistically significant greater\nreduction in percentage overweight than the diet only group.\nA third RCT (n=35) compared a callisthenics group, a life-\nstyle exercise group, and an aerobic exercise programme.35 All\nTa\nb\nle\n1\nco\nnt\nin\nue\nd\nRe\nfe\nre\nnc\ne\nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nan\nts\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn,\ndu\nra\ntio\nn\nRe\nsu\nlts\nC\nom\nm\nen\nts\nG\nor\ntm\nak\ner\n28\n(U\nSA\n,1\n99\n9)\nSc\nho\nol\nch\nild\nre\nn\n(g\nra\nde\ns\n6\u2013\n8)\nM\nea\nn\nag\ne:\n11\n.7\nye\nar\ns\n48\n%\nfe\nm\nal\ne\nI:\nSc\nho\nol\n-b\nas\ned\nin\nte\nrd\nis\nci\npl\nin\nar\ny\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\nfo\ncu\nse\nd\non\nde\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nte\nle\nvi\nsi\non\nvi\new\nin\ng,\nde\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nco\nns\num\npt\nio\nn\nof\nhi\ngh\n-fa\ntf\noo\nds\n,\nin\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nfru\nit\nan\nd\nve\nge\nta\nbl\ne\nco\nns\num\npt\nio\nn\nan\nd\nen\nco\nur\nag\nin\ng\nin\ncr\nea\nse\ns\nin\nph\nys\nic\nal\nac\ntiv\nity\n(n\n=6\n41\n)\nC\n:N\no\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\n(n\n=6\n54\n)\nFo\nllo\nw\nup\n:1\n8\nm\non\nth\ns\n(2\nsc\nho\nol\nye\nar\ns)\nC\nha\nng\ne\nin\npr\nev\nal\nen\nce\nof\nob\nes\nity\nin\ngi\nrls\n(%\n):\nC\n=+\n2.\n2,\nI=\n\u20133\n.3\nA\ndj\nus\nte\nd\nO\nR=\n0.\n47\n(9\n5%\nC\nI0\n.2\n4\nto\n0.\n93\n,p\n=0\n.0\n3)\nC\nha\nng\ne\nin\npr\nev\nal\nen\nce\nof\nob\nes\nity\nin\nbo\nys\n(%\n):\nC\n=\u2013\n2.\n3,\nI=\n\u20131\n.5\nA\ndj\nus\nte\nd\nO\nR=\n0.\n85\n(9\n5%\nC\nI0\n.5\n2\nto\n1.\n39\n,p\n=0\n.4\n8)\nRa\nnd\nom\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\nn:\nTe\nn\nsc\nho\nol\ns\nm\nat\nch\ned\nac\nco\nrd\nin\ng\nto\nto\nw\nn,\nsi\nze\nan\nd\net\nhn\nic\nco\nm\npo\nsi\ntio\nn,\nra\nnd\nom\nis\ned\nus\nin\ng\nra\nnd\nom\nnu\nm\nbe\nrt\nab\nle\nBl\nin\ndi\nng\n:\nC\nhi\nld\nre\nn:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nov\nid\ner\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne\nas\nse\nss\nor\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nM\nul\nle\nr2\n7\n(G\ner\nm\nan\ny,\n20\n01\n)\nSc\nho\nol\nch\nild\nre\nn\nM\nea\nn\nag\ne:\nno\ntg\niv\nen\n.\nA\nge\nra\nng\ne\n5\u2013\n7\nye\nar\ns\n%\nfe\nm\nal\ne:\nno\ntg\niv\nen\nI:\nA\nts\nch\noo\nl,\nan\n8\nho\nur\nco\nur\nse\nof\nnu\ntri\ntio\nn\ned\nuc\nat\nio\nn\nin\ncl\nud\nin\ng\n\u201ca\nct\niv\ne\u201d\nbr\nea\nks\ngi\nve\nn\nby\na\nsk\nill\ned\nnu\ntri\ntio\nni\nst\nan\nd\na\ntra\nin\ned\nte\nac\nhe\nr.\nIn\ncl\nud\ned\nth\ne\nfo\nllo\nw\nin\ng\nm\nes\nsa\nge\ns:\n\u201ce\nat\nfru\nit\nan\nd\nve\nge\nta\nbl\nes\nea\nch\nda\ny\u201d\n,\u201c\nre\ndu\nce\nin\nta\nke\nof\nhi\ngh\nfa\ntf\noo\nds\n\u201d,\nke\nep\nac\ntiv\ne\nat\nle\nas\nt1\nho\nur\nea\nch\nda\ny\u201d\n,\n\u201cd\nec\nre\nas\ne\nTV\nco\nns\num\npt\nio\nn\nto\nle\nss\nth\nan\n1\nho\nur\npe\nrd\nay\n\u201d.\n(A\ndd\niti\non\nal\nfa\nm\nily\n-b\nas\ned\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\npl\nus\na\nstr\nuc\ntu\nre\nd\nsp\nor\nts\npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne\nw\ner\ne\nof\nfe\nre\nd\nto\nfa\nm\nili\nes\nw\nith\nov\ner\nw\nei\ngh\nto\nro\nbe\nse\nch\nild\nre\nn\nan\nd\nto\nfa\nm\nili\nes\nw\nith\nno\nrm\nal\nw\nei\ngh\ntc\nhi\nld\nre\nn\nbu\nto\nbe\nse\npa\nre\nnt\ns)\n(n\n=1\n36\n)\nC\n:N\no\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\n(n\n=1\n61\n)\nFo\nllo\nw\nup\n:O\nne\nye\nar\nM\ned\nia\nn\nBM\nI(\nba\nse\nlin\ne,\n1\nye\nar\n):\nI=\n15\n.2\n,1\n6.\n1;\nC\n=1\n5.\n4,\n16\n.3\n;\np=\nN\nS\nM\ned\nia\nn\ntri\nce\nps\nsk\nin\nfo\nld\n(m\nm\n)(\nba\nse\nlin\ne,\n1\nye\nar\n):\nI=\n10\n.9\n,1\n1.\n3;\nC\n=1\n0.\n7,\n13\n.0\n;p\n<0\n.0\n1\nRa\nnd\nom\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\nn:\nm\net\nho\nd\nno\ntd\nes\ncr\nib\ned\nBl\nin\ndi\nng\n:\nC\nhi\nld\nre\nn:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nov\nid\ner\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne\nas\nse\nss\nor\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nI=\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn;\nC\n=c\non\ntro\nl.\nThe prevention and treatment of childhood obesity 67\nwww.qshc.com\n group.bmj.com on November 5, 2009 -

At 1 year follow up in the first RCT, all groups\n(increased exercise, decreased sedentary behaviours or both)\nhad lost weight compared with baseline.37 However, children\nin the reduced sedentary behaviour group had a statistically\nsignificant greater reduction in percentage overweight than\nthe other groups. In the other RCT all groups (high or low\nincreased physical activity, high or low decreased sedentary\nbehaviours) showed significant decreases in percentage over-\nweight at 6 and 24 months compared with baseline.38\nHowever, the differences between the groups were not statis-\ntically significant.\nBehaviour modification programmes (table 3)\nParents as agents of change\nIn one RCT (n=33) overweight children (aged 8\u201312 years) and\ntheir parents were assigned to a multi-component behavioural\n\u201cweight reduction only\u201d programme, a parent training\nprogramme involving the same multi-component weight\nreduction behavioural treatment preceded by a short course\nfor the parents in child management skills, or a waiting list\ncontrol.39 At 1 year follow up, while both intervention groups\ngained weight, there was a statistically significant increase in\npercentage overweight in the weight reduction only group\ncompared with the parent training group.\nIn the SHAPEDOWN programme, parents were instructed\non strategies for supporting the weight loss efforts of their\nchildren, including altering family dietary and activity\npatterns and improving parenting and communication\nskills.40 At 15month follow up, participants in the intervention\nprogramme (n=37) had statistically significant decreases in\nrelative weight compared with a no-intervention control\ngroup (n=29).\nAnother RCT (n=39) evaluated the effects of targeting\nobese children and their parents for mastery of diet, exercise,\nweight loss, and parenting skills over 2 years.41 A control group\nwas taught general strategies for changing behaviour. At 6 and\n12 months follow up, children in the intervention group had a\nstatistically significant relative weight reduction compared\nwith controls. These results were not maintained at 2 years.\nThe final RCT (n=60) examined the effects of parents tak-\ning responsibility for their children\u2019s behaviour change\ncompared with the conventional approach in which children\nwere responsible for their own weight loss.42 At 1 year follow\nup, children in both groups showed a significant decrease in\nobesity, although there was a statistically significantly greater\nreduction in the parent-led intervention group.\nFamily based behaviour modification programmes\nOne RCT (n=42) compared three methods of involving (or not\ninvolving) mothers (mother-child separately, mother-child\ntogether, and child alone) in the treatment of their obese\nadolescents.43 The intervention programme consisted of\nbehaviour modification, social support, diet, and exercise. At 1\nyear follow up, the \u201cmother-Child separately\u201d group had lost\nsignificantly more weight and showed greater reductions in\npercentage overweight than the other two groups which, in\nturn, did not differ from each other.\nA second trial (n=40) compared behavioural treatment\ngroups (parent plus child, child only) with a waiting list con-\ntrol group.44 Children in both behavioural groups lost weight\nTa\nb\nle\n2\nco\nnt\nin\nue\nd\nRe\nfe\nre\nnc\ne\nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nan\nts\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nns\n,\ndu\nra\ntio\nn\nRe\nsu\nlts\nC\nom\nm\nen\nts\nJo\nhn\nso\nn5\n7\n(U\nSA\n,1\n99\n7)\nO\nbe\nse\nch\nild\nre\nn\n(a\nge\nd\n8\u2013\n17\nye\nar\ns)\nan\nd\nth\nei\nrp\nar\nen\nts\nM\nea\nn\nag\ne:\n11\n.0\nye\nar\ns\n72\n%\nfe\nm\nal\ne\nI1\n:7\nw\nee\nk\nnu\ntri\ntio\nn\nan\nd\nea\ntin\ng\nha\nbi\nti\nnt\ner\nve\nnt\nio\nn,\nfo\nllo\nw\ned\nby\n7\nw\nee\nk\nae\nro\nbi\nc\nex\ner\nci\nse\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\n(n\n=9\n)\nI2\n:7\nw\nee\nk\nae\nro\nbi\nc\nex\ner\nci\nse\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\nfo\nllo\nw\ned\nby\n7\nw\nee\nk\nnu\ntri\ntio\nn\nan\nd\nea\ntin\ng\nha\nbi\nti\nnt\ner\nve\nnt\nio\nn\n(n\n=1\n0)\nC\n:1\n4\u2013\nw\nee\nk\ned\nuc\nat\nio\nn\non\ndi\net\nan\nd\nex\ner\nci\nse\nw\nith\nin\nstr\nuc\ntio\nns\nfo\nrb\neh\nav\nio\nur\nal\nch\nan\nge\ns\n(n\n=9\n)\nFo\nllo\nw\nup\n:9\nw\nee\nks\n,1\n6\nw\nee\nks\nan\nd\n5\nye\nar\ns\n(n\n=6\nin\nea\nch\ngr\nou\np\nat\n5\nye\nar\nfo\nllo\nw\nup\n)\nM\nea\nn\nw\nei\ngh\nt(\nkg\n):\nW\nee\nk\n1:\nI1\n=7\n3.\n2,\nI2\n=7\n2.\n0,\nC\n=6\n8.\n6\nW\nee\nk\n9:\nI1\n=7\n2.\n0,\nI2\n=7\n3.\n4,\nC\n=6\n8.\n5\nW\nee\nk\n16\n:I\n1=\n70\n.8\n,I\n2=\n71\n.0\n,C\n=6\n8.\n9\nC\nha\nng\ne\nin\nw\nei\ngh\nto\nve\nrw\nee\nks\n1\u2013\n16\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nfo\nrI\n1\n(p\n<0\n.0\n1)\nC\nha\nng\ne\nov\ner\nw\nee\nks\n9\u2013\n16\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nfo\nrI\n2\n(p\n<0\n.0\n1)\nM\nea\nn\n%\nof\nid\nea\nlb\nod\ny\nw\nei\ngh\nt(\npr\net\nre\nat\nm\nen\nt,\n5\nye\nar\nfo\nllo\nw\nup\n):\nI1\n=1\n68\n.8\n,1\n37\n.3\nI2\n=1\n53\n,1\n37\n.8\nC\n=1\n86\n.5\n,1\n75\n.2\nI1\nan\nd\nI2\nbo\nth\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nly\nlo\nw\ner\nth\nan\nC\n(p\n<0\n.0\n1)\nRa\nnd\nom\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\nn:\nM\net\nho\nd\nno\nt\nde\nsc\nrib\ned\nBl\nin\ndi\nng\n:\nC\nhi\nld\nre\nn:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nov\nid\ner\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne\nas\nse\nss\nor\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nEp\nste\nin\n38\n(U\nSA\n,\n20\n00\n)\nO\nbe\nse\nch\nild\nre\nn\n(a\nge\nd\n8\u2013\n12\nye\nar\ns)\n)a\nnd\nat\nle\nas\nto\nne\npa\nre\nnt\nM\nea\nn\nag\ne:\n10\n.5\nye\nar\ns\n68\n%\nfe\nm\nal\ne\nI:\nIn\ncr\nea\nsi\nng\nph\nys\nic\nal\nac\ntiv\nity\n(h\nig\nh\ndo\nse\n,n\n=1\n9\nlo\nw\ndo\nse\n,n\n=1\n8)\nC\n:D\nec\nre\nas\nin\ng\nse\nde\nnt\nar\ny\nbe\nha\nvi\nou\nr(\nhi\ngh\ndo\nse\n,n\n=2\n0;\nlo\nw\ndo\nse\n,n\n=1\n9)\nBo\nth\ngr\nou\nps\nre\nce\niv\ned\n6\nm\non\nth\ns\ntre\nat\nm\nen\nta\nnd\nfo\nllo\nw\ned\nth\ne\n\u201ct\nra\nffi\nc\nlig\nht\n\u201d\ndi\net\nFo\nllo\nw\nup\n:1\n2\nan\nd\n24\nm\non\nth\ns\nC\nha\nng\ne\nin\npe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\nov\ner\nw\nei\ngh\ntf\nro\nm\nba\nse\nlin\ne\n(m\nea\nn,\nSD\n):\n0\u2013\n6\nm\non\nth\ns:\nI:\nlo\nw\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n25\n.6\n(8\n.1\n),\nhi\ngh\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n26\n.4\n(1\n0.\n5)\nC\n:l\now\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n22\n.4\n(1\n2.\n6)\n,h\nig\nh\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n27\n.4\n(1\n0.\n7)\nA\nll\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\n(p\n<0\n.0\n1)\n0\u2013\n24\nm\non\nth\ns:\nI:\nlo\nw\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n12\n.4\n(1\n3.\n3)\n,h\nig\nh\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n13\n.2\n(1\n6.\n4)\nC\n:l\now\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n11\n.6\n(2\n1.\n9)\n,h\nig\nh\ndo\nse\n=\u2013\n14\n.3\n(1\n6.\n9)\nA\nll\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\n(p\n<0\n.0\n1)\nRa\nnd\nom\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\nn:\nFa\nm\nili\nes\nstr\nat\nifi\ned\nby\nge\nnd\ner\nan\nd\nde\ngr\nee\nof\nch\nild\nan\nd\npa\nre\nnt\nob\nes\nity\nBl\nin\ndi\nng\n:\nC\nhi\nld\nre\nn:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nov\nid\ner\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne\nas\nse\nss\nor\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nI=\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn;\nC\n=c\non\ntro\nl.\nThe prevention and treatment of childhood obesity 69\nwww.qshc.com\n group.bmj.com on November 5, 2009 -

There were\nno statistically significant differences between the groups at\neither 3 or 6 months follow up.\nAnother RCT compared four different behaviour modifica-\ntion programmes (summer camp training, advice in a single\nsession, group outpatient, individual outpatient) for obese\nchildren against a control group.48 However, the only\nparticipants who were randomised were those allocated to the\ntwo outpatient programmes (n=93). A statistically significant\nreduction in mean percentage overweight was found at 6 and\n12 months follow up for both outpatient groups compared\nwith baseline. However, there were no statistically significant\ndifferences between the two groups.\nA 6 month family based behavioural weight control\nprogramme (n=67 families) compared parent and child prob-\nlem solving, child problem solving, and \u201cstandard\u201d family\nbased treatment (no problem solving).49 Over 24 months\nfollow up the \u201cstandard\u201d group had a larger decrease in BMI\nthan the parent and child group.\nFinally, 31 families with obese children were randomised to\nreceive \u201cmixed\u201d behavioural treatment (a mixture of individu-\nalised plus group therapy) or \u201cgroup\u201d behavioural treatment\n(that did not involve individual therapy).50 At 12 months fol-\nlow up, both treatments produced a statistically significant\nreduction in percentage overweight and BMI compared with\nbaseline. However, there were no significant differences\nbetween the groups.\nBehaviour modification with no parental involvement\nOne RCT (n=197) of a 6 week inpatient rehabilitation\nprogramme for children and adolescents compared a three\npart cognitive-behavioural programme with a programme\nthat provided muscle relaxation training.51 Both intervention\ngroups received the same diet and exercise programme. In\nboth groups the percentage overweight was significantly\nreduced over the course of 1 year compared with baseline. Dif-\nferences between the groups were not statistically significant.\nPharmacological interventions\nOne RCT examined the effects of metformin on BMI, serum\nleptin, glucose tolerance, and serum lipids in 29 obese young\npeople aged 12\u201319 years with fasting hyperinsulinaemia and a\nfamily history of type 2 diabetes.52 At the end of the 6 month\nTa\nb\nle\n3\nco\nnt\nin\nue\nd\nRe\nfe\nre\nnc\ne\nPa\nrt\nic\nip\nan\nts\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nns\n,\ndu\nra\ntio\nn\nRe\nsu\nlts\nC\nom\nm\nen\nts\nG\nol\ndf\nie\nld\n50\n(U\nSA\n,\n20\n01\n)\nFa\nm\nili\nes\nw\nith\nob\nes\ne\nch\nild\nre\nn\n(a\nge\nd\n8\u2013\n12\nye\nar\ns)\nM\nea\nn\nag\ne:\nI1\n=9\n.8\nye\nar\ns,\nI2\n=1\n0.\n3\nye\nar\ns\n71\n%\nfe\nm\nal\ne\nI1\n:M\nix\ned\ntre\nat\nm\nen\nt,\nw\nhe\nre\nby\npa\nrti\nci\npa\nnt\ns\nre\nce\niv\ned\na\nm\nix\ntu\nre\nof\nin\ndi\nvi\ndu\nal\nis\ned\npl\nus\ngr\nou\np\ntre\nat\nm\nen\nt(\nn=\n12\n)\nI2\n:g\nro\nup\ntre\nat\nm\nen\ntt\nha\ntd\nid\nno\nti\nnv\nol\nve\nin\ndi\nvi\ndu\nal\nth\ner\nap\ny\n(n\n=1\n2)\nFo\nllo\nw\nup\n:6\nan\nd\n12\nm\non\nth\ns\nM\nea\nn\n(S\nD\n)c\nha\nng\ne\nin\npe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\nov\ner\nw\nei\ngh\nt:\nBa\nse\nlin\ne\u2013\n6\nm\non\nth\ns:\n\u20139\n.9\n7\n(8\n.7\n)\nBa\nse\nlin\ne\u2013\n12\nm\non\nth\ns:\n\u20138\n.0\n4\n(1\n0.\n3)\nM\nea\nn\n(S\nD\n)c\nha\nng\ne\nin\nZ-\nBM\nI:\nBa\nse\nlin\ne\u2013\n6\nm\non\nth\ns:\n\u20130\n.5\n9\n(0\n.4\n9)\nBa\nse\nlin\ne\u2013\n12\nm\non\nth\ns:\n\u20130\n.6\n4\n(0\n.6\n3)\nD\nat\na\nfo\nrs\nep\nar\nat\ne\ngr\nou\nps\nno\ntg\niv\nen\nA\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nre\ndu\nct\nio\nn\nin\npe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\nov\ner\nw\nei\ngh\nta\nnd\nZ\u2013\nBM\nIw\nas\nfo\nun\nd\nfo\nrb\not\nh\nty\npe\ns\nof\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\nov\ner\ntim\ne\n(p\n<0\n.0\n01\n),\nth\nou\ngh\nth\ner\ne\nw\ner\ne\nno\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\ndi\nffe\nre\nnc\nes\nbe\ntw\nee\nn\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nns\n.\nI2\nw\nas\nfo\nun\nd\nto\nbe\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nly\nm\nor\ne\nco\nst\nef\nfe\nct\niv\ne,\ndu\ne\nto\nth\ne\ngr\nea\nte\nre\nxp\nen\nse\nof\nI1\nRa\nnd\nom\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\nn:\nM\net\nho\nd\nno\ntd\nes\ncr\nib\ned\nBl\nin\ndi\nng\n:\nC\nhi\nld\nre\nn:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nov\nid\ner\ns:\nN\no\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne\nas\nse\nss\nor\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nog\nra\nm\nm\nes\nw\nith\nno\npa\nre\nnt\nal\nin\nvo\nlv\nem\nen\nt\nW\nar\nsc\nhb\nur\nge\nr5\n1\n(G\ner\nm\nan\ny,\n20\n01\n)\nO\nbe\nse\nch\nild\nre\nn\nan\nd\nad\nol\nes\nce\nnt\ns\n(a\nge\nd\n9\u2013\n19\nye\nar\ns)\nM\nea\nn\nag\ne:\nI=\n13\n.8\n,C\n=1\n3.\n1\n%\nfe\nm\nal\ne:\nno\ntg\niv\nen\nIn\npa\ntie\nnt\nre\nha\nbi\nlit\nat\nio\nn\npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne\nI1\n.G\nro\nup\nw\nhi\nch\npa\nrti\nci\npa\nte\nd\nin\n\u201co\nbe\nsi\nty\ntra\nin\nin\ng\u201d\n(a\nth\nre\ne\npa\nrt\npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\ne\nw\nhi\nch\nin\ncl\nud\ned\na\nco\ngn\niti\nve\n-b\neh\nav\nio\nur\nal\ntra\nin\nin\ng\npr\nog\nra\nm\n,\na\nca\nlo\nrie\nre\ndu\nce\nd\ndi\net\nan\nd\nan\nex\ner\nci\nse\npr\nog\nra\nm\n;n\n=1\n21\n)\nI2\n.G\nro\nup\nw\nhi\nch\nun\nde\nrto\nok\nth\ne\nsa\nm\ne\ndi\net\nan\nd\nex\ner\nci\nse\npr\nog\nra\nm\nm\nes\nbu\ntr\nec\nei\nve\nd\nm\nus\ncl\ne\nre\nla\nxa\ntio\nn\ntra\nin\nin\ng\nin\nste\nad\nof\nth\ne\nps\nyc\nho\nlo\ngi\nca\nl\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn\nco\nm\npo\nne\nnt\n(n\n=7\n6)\nFo\nllo\nw\nup\n:6\nan\nd\n12\nm\non\nth\ns\nC\nha\nng\ne\nin\nm\nea\nn\npe\nrc\nen\nta\nge\nov\ner\nw\nei\ngh\nt:\n6\nw\nee\nks\n:I\n1=\n\u20131\n5.\n47\n,I\n2=\n\u20131\n4.\n03\nBo\nth\ngr\nou\nps\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\nly\nre\ndu\nce\nd\nth\nei\nrp\ner\nce\nnt\nag\ne\nov\ner\nw\nei\ngh\nto\nve\nrt\nhe\nco\nur\nse\nof\non\ne\nye\nar\nco\nm\npa\nre\nd\nw\nith\nba\nse\nlin\ne.\nD\niff\ner\nen\nce\ns\nbe\ntw\nee\nn\nth\ne\ngr\nou\nps\nw\ner\ne\nno\nt\nsi\ngn\nifi\nca\nnt\n(p\nva\nlu\nes\nno\ntr\nep\nor\nte\nd)\nRa\nnd\nom\nal\nlo\nca\ntio\nn:\nM\net\nho\nd\nno\ntd\nes\ncr\nib\ned\nBl\nin\ndi\nng\n:\nC\nhi\nld\nre\nn:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nPr\nov\nid\ner\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nO\nut\nco\nm\ne\nas\nse\nss\nor\ns:\nU\nnc\nle\nar\nI=\nin\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nn;\nC\n=c\non\ntro\nls.\n72 Wilson, O\u2019Meara, Summerbell, et al\nwww.qshc.com\n group.bmj.com on November 5, 2009 - Published by qshc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nstudy a statistically significant difference (p<0.02) was found\nbetween the BMI scores for the intervention group (BMI\ndecreased) compared with the placebo group (BMI increased).\nThe National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has\napproved the use of two drugs, orlistat and sibutramine, in the\nmanagement of adult obesity.53 54 However, there is no\nguidance for the use of these agents in children. An RCT trial\nof the use of orlistat in obese 12\u201317 year olds funded by the US\nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development is\ncurrently ongoing.55\nIMPLICATIONS\nThere is a lack of good quality evidence on the effectiveness of\ninterventions on which to base national strategies or to inform\nclinical practice. Trials are often small in size, have high drop\nout rates, are poorly reported, and crucially involve settings\nthat may be difficult to translate to the UK. Additionally,many\nof the interventions have been evaluated in only one or two\nstudies and most of the research has been conducted in North\nAmerica. Many of the studies recruited children either\nthrough existing specialist obesity centres or media advertise-\nments. As such, results from these studies may not be applica-\nble to children and their families in other settings.\nFuture research must be of good methodological quality,\ninvolve large numbers of participants in appropriate settings,\nand needs to be of longer duration and intensity. The cost\neffectiveness of obesity related prevention and treatment\nneeds to be addressed.\nThere are now a number of government initiatives\nspecifically highlighting the key role that schools can play in\nimproving the health of children. There is some evidence that\nmultifaceted school based programmes that promote physical\nactivity, the modification of dietary intake, and the targeting\nof sedentary behaviours may help to reduce obesity in school\nchildren, particularly girls.\nMultifaceted family based programmes that involve par-\nents, increase physical activity, provide dietary education, and\ntarget reductions in sedentary behaviour may help children to\nlose weight.\nThere is some evidence that family based behaviour modifi-\ncation programmes,where parents take primary responsibility\nand act as agents of change, may help children to lose weight.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe following CRD staff (in alphabetical order) comprised the Effective\nHealth Care childhood obesity review team: Christopher Bridle, Sarah\nKing, Lisa Mather, Mark Rodgers, Nancy Rowland, Frances Sharp,\nAmanda Sowden and Paul Wilson.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\nP Wilson, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of\nYork, York, UK\nS O\u2019Meara, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, UK\nC Summerbell, S Kelly, School of Health and Social Care, University of\nTeesside, UK\nREFERENCES\n1 NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.
