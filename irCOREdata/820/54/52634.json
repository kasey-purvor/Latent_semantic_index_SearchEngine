Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 3\nIntroduction \nFingerprints have a key role in crime detection.  The comparison of fingerprints recovered from a crime \nscene with either fingerprints taken from a suspect or with an individual\u2019s record held on a database \nprovides a powerful tool.  Fingerprint evidence found at a crime scene may be described as visible, plastic \n(impression) or latent.  Latent fingerprints are the most commonly encountered type at crime scenes and are \nnot readily visible.  Visualisation techniques are a commonplace tool employed to enhance such \nfingerprints, enabling them to be recorded and identified.  A wide array of chemical, physical and optical \ntechniques is used including ninhydrin, cyanoacrylate (superglue) fuming and powdering [1].  \nImprovements of current techniques are continually sought providing greater sensitivity and wider \napplications.   \n \nThe identification of novel enhancement techniques occupies much of the research in this field.  A variety \nof strategies are employed in the development of new latent fingerprint enhancement techniques such as the \nexploitation of chemical analogues of existing reagents or the application of reagents used in other fields \n[2,3].  A further strategy involves the targeting of specific compounds in latent fingerprint residue, for \nexample the detection of drug metabolites using antibodies immobilised on nanoparticles or the \nimmunodetection of peptides and proteins [4,5,6].  In some instances these enhancement techniques may \nprovide information about personal habits, as well as develop ridge detail [4,5].  Novel applications of \nanalytical techniques, including micro-X-ray fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and \ntime-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry are also being used in the visualisation of latent fingerprints \nand to study their behaviour [7,8,9,10].  Prior knowledge of the chemical composition of latent fingerprint \nresidue, and its behaviour after deposition on a surface, would aid the identification of target components, \nand in particular those which are common to all fingerprints, to allow for a universal reagent or technique \nto be developed.  \n \nLatent fingerprints are composed of the natural secretions of glands in the skin, principally eccrine and \nsebaceous glands.  Eccrine sweat consists predominantly of water and the remainder is a highly complex \nmixture of organic (e.g. amino acids, proteins and lactate) and inorganic material (e.g. Na+, K+, Cl- and \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 4\ntrace metal ions).  Sebaceous secretions are predominantly composed of fatty acids, glycerides, cholesterol, \nsqualene and a variety of lipid esters.  Environmental contaminants, e.g. bacteria spores, dust, cosmetics, \nhair products and tobacco products, may also contribute [11].  Whilst extensive data are available on the \nconstituents of sweat, relatively little data is currently available on the specific composition of \u2018real\u2019 latent \nfingerprints and how it changes with time after deposition. \n \nMany of the latent fingerprint studies conducted to date have studied the lipid components namely fatty \nacids, long chain fatty acid esters, squalene, cholesterol and wax esters.  The lipid composition of latent \nfingerprints has been found to vary between individuals with age and gender [12,13,14].  Chemical changes \nthat occur following deposition and environmental conditions are an important factor [15].  Unsaturated \ncompounds such as squalene, oleic (cis-9-octadecenoic) and palmitoleic (cis-9-hexadecenoic) acids are \npredominantly lost over time, whilst saturated compounds essentially remain unchanged [13,15].  Lower \nmolecular weight compounds, such as short chain fatty acids appear in the fingerprint as it ages and are \nformed as unsaturated compound degradation products.  Degradation of squalene is more rapid in light \nconditions compared to dark [15]. Mountfort et al. [16] identified squalene oxidation products in aged \nlatent fingerprints including squalene monohydroperoxide and squalene epoxide and suggested that these \nand other oxidation products could be potential targets for novel visualisation reagents. \n \nIt is estimated that the average amino acid content of a fingerprint is 250 ng [17].  Amino acids present on \nthe surfaces of the hands have been studied previously in the 1960s, although not in the context of latent \nfingerprints per se [18,19,20]. The relative concentrations of free amino acids are comparable between the \nstudies with serine, glycine, ornithine and alanine being most abundant.  Cuthbertson [21] studied the \naqueous components of latent fingerprints including amino acids and chloride.  Chloride concentration was \nfound to vary between donors (age, occupation) and was affected by digit used and the porosity of the \nsubstrate.  The mean concentration of chloride was almost three times greater in those fingerprints \ndeposited on filter paper compared to those on aluminium foil. \n \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 5\nA novel procedure which permits the simultaneous analysis of lipid and nitrogenous material, namely fatty \nacids, squalene and amino acids, in \u2018real\u2019 latent fingerprints has previously been reported [22]. The protocol \naimed to allow the analysis of the natural distribution of a variety of substances in latent fingerprints.  One \nof the key objectives of the protocol was to ensure that the fingerprint collection protocol mimics as closely \nas possible fingerprints as would be found at a crime scene. The use of this protocol to study the qualitative \nand quantitative variation between individuals in the amino acid and fatty acid content of their latent \nfingerprints is reported here.  The impact of the sampling protocol on fingerprint residue composition is \nalso explored to inform our interpretation of fingerprint studies. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nMaterials \nL-asparagine (Asn), L-p-chlorophenylalanine (cPhe), L-cysteine (Cys), 4-hydroxy-L-proline (HPro), L-\nornithine hydrochloride (Orn) and L-tryptophan (Trp) (all > 99%), octanoic (C8), decanoic (C10), \nundecanoic  (C11), dodecanoic (C12), tridecanoic (C13), tetradecanoic (C14), cis-9-tetradecenoic (C14:1), \npentadecanoic (C15), hexadecanoic (C16), cis-9-hexadecenoic (C16:1), octadecanoic (C18), cis-9-\noctadecenoic (C18:1), cis-9,12-octadecadienoic (C18:2) and eicosanoic (C20) acids (all \u2265 98%), pyridine \n(ACS reagent) and squalene (98%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, Dorset).  The amino \nacid standard AA-S-18, containing L-alanine (Ala), L-arginine (Arg), L-aspartic acid (Asp), glycine (Gly), \nL-glutamic acid (Glu), L-isoleucine (Ile), L-leucine (Leu), L-lysine (Lys), L-methionine (Met), L-\nphenylalanine (Phe), L-proline (Pro), L-serine (Ser), L-threonine (Thr), L-tyrosine (Tyr), L-valine (Val) at \n2.5 \u03bcmol mL-1 and L-cystine at 1.25 \u03bcmol mL-1, was also obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.  Heptadecanoic \n(C17, 99.3%), and tetracosanoic (C24, 99.3%) acids, ethyl chloroformate (ECF, > 98%) and iso-octane (> \n99.5%) were obtained from Fluka (Gillingham, Dorset).  Acetonitrile (ACN), hexane, methanol, ethanol, \nand chloroform were of analytical-reagent or HPLC grade and were obtained from Fisher Scientific UK \nLimited (Loughborough, Leics.).  Hydrochloric acid (0.1 M and 1 M) was volumetric analysis grade and \nalso obtained from Fisher Scientific UK Limited.  Sodium hydroxide pearls (> 98%), purchased from \nPhillip Harris (Shenstone, Lichfield), were used to prepare a 1% w\/v solution in deionised water. Mylar\u00ae \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 6\n002, polyester film, 23 \u03bcm thickness, was obtained from DuPont Teijin Films (UK) Limited \n(Middlesbrough, UK). \n \nPreparation of calibration samples for quantification \nEquimolar amino acid calibration solutions were prepared in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, using the amino acid \nstandard solution AA-S-18 and solutions prepared from individual standards, ranging between 1.25 and 200 \nnmol mL-1.  Equimolar fatty acid solutions in hexane were prepared ranging between 5 and 1200 nmol mL-\n1.  \n \nAmino acid and fatty acid calibration samples were prepared, extracted, derivatised and analysed by GC-\nMS each day.  For each calibration sample, 25 \u03bcL amino acid calibration solution were applied to a 2 cm by \n2 cm piece of Mylar\u00ae 002 polyester film (pre-washed in each of methanol, 1% (w\/v) sodium hydroxide and \nacetone in turn) and allowed to dry at room temperature overnight (maximum 15 hours).  Twenty-five \nmicrolitres of the corresponding fatty acid calibration solution were applied to the sample on top of the \namino acids and allowed to dry (5 min).  Eight microlitres nonadecanoic acid (1.875 \u03bcmol mL-1 in hexane, \nfatty acid internal standard) and 8 \u03bcL p-chlorophenylalanine (0.3125 \u03bcmol mL-1 in methanol, amino acid \ninternal standard) were applied in turn.  The samples were allowed to dry fully for 10 minutes. \n \nSqualene calibration standards for GC-FID analysis were prepared by depositing 25 \u03bcL squalene (0 \u2013 5 \n\u03bcmol mL-1 in chloroform) and 8 \u03bcL nonadecanoic acid (1.875 \u03bcmol mL-1 in hexane) on a 2 by 2 cm piece \nof Mylar\u00ae (pre-washed as described previously) and allowed to dry.     \n \nCollection of latent fingerprint samples \nFingerprint samples were collected in accordance with the University of Lincoln ethical approval protocol \n(Table 1).  Donors gave their informed consent and all samples and donor information were anonymised \nand identified using an alphanumeric code.  Donors were requested not to have washed their hands in the \nhour preceding sampling.  Donors rubbed their hands together to evenly distribute skin surface residues.  \nTwo fingerprints were deposited on a Mylar\u00ae 002 strip (10 cm x 2 cm, pre-washed as described above) \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 7\nfrom each of the left middle, left ring, right ring and right middle fingers, with as little overlap as possible \n(i.e. eight fingerprints deposited in total).  The donor\u2019s fingers were placed onto the substrate by the \nresearcher to control the amount of pressure applied and contact time.  These fingerprint samples are \nreferred to as the \u2018natural\u2019 samples.  \n \nThe donor then rubbed their fingers across the forehead and nose regions of their face for approximately 10 \nseconds and subsequently rubbed their hands together as previously.  The procedure described above was \nrepeated to collect samples for chemical analysis.  These samples are referred to as the \u2018groomed\u2019 samples. \n \nThirty minutes after collection, 8 \u03bcL L-p-chlorophenylalanine in methanol (0.3125 \u03bcmol mL-1) and 8 \u03bcL \nnonadecanoic acid in hexane (1.875 \u03bcmol mL-1) were applied evenly to each fingerprint sample collected \nfor chemical analysis.  Negative controls were prepared in the same way, using a 10 x 2 cm strip of Mylar\u00ae \nwithout the addition of fingerprints.   \n \nExtraction and derivatisation of sample \nFor each fingerprint and calibration sample, the Mylar\u00ae was cut smaller into 5 mm by 5 mm squares using a \nscalpel and glass Petri dish which were cleaned with acetone and ethanol between samples.  The sample \nwas then placed in a 4 mL amber glass vial with 1 mL of 1% (w\/v) sodium hydroxide, ethanol and pyridine, \n75:40:10 v\/v\/v.  After 1 hour on a shaker (200 cycles min-1), 200 \u03bcL ECF:iso-octane 1:3 (v\/v) were added \nand the sample vortexed for 30 seconds.  After 1 minute, 40 \u03bcL pyridine and 50 \u03bcL ECF were added, \nvortexed for a further 30 seconds and left to stand for 2-3 minutes.  The solvent was then transferred to a \nsecond 4 mL amber vial containing 1 mL chloroform with 1% (v\/v) ECF.  The sample was vortexed for 30 \nseconds and allowed to separate.  The upper aqueous layer was removed and discarded.  One millilitre \nhydrochloric acid (1 M) was then added and the sample vortexed for 30 seconds.  The lower organic phase \nwas transferred to a 2 mL amber vial and was reduced in volume to approximately 500 \u03bcL under a stream \nof nitrogen at room temperature.  The sample was transferred to a 200 \u03bcL autosampler vial in aliquots and \nevaporated to dryness.  Fifty microlitres chloroform were then added and the sample sonicated for 1 \nminute.  Samples were not injected until at least 30 minutes after chloroform addition.   \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 8\n \nGC-MS Analysis \nSamples were analysed on a Thermo Finnigan Trace GC coupled with a Thermo Finnigan Trace MS (Mass \nSpec UK Ltd, Oldham, UK).  One microlitre aliquots were injected onto a DB-17ms fused silica capillary \ncolumn (30 m x 0.25 mm internal diameter (i.d.) x 0.15 \u03bcm 50% phenylmethyl silicone film thickness, J & \nW Scientific, Folsom, CA) in splitless mode.  The column was held at 100 oC for 4.5 minutes, ramped to \n190 oC at 10 oC min-1, then to 250 oC at a rate of 6 oC min-1 and finally held for 10 minutes.  The carrier gas \nwas helium (1 mL min-1) and injector and transfer line temperatures were 250 oC. \n \nThe mass spectrometer was operated in scan and selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode.  All samples were \nanalysed in SIM mode for quantification.  Fingerprint and negative control samples were also analysed in \nscan mode for qualitative purposes.  In scan mode, the spectrometer was set to monitor ions 50 to 500 m\/z \nwith a scan time of 1 second, following a 4.5 minute solvent delay.  In SIM mode, the spectrometer was set \nto monitor at least three characteristic ions per compound.  For the positive identification of a compound, \nion ratio matches for three characteristic ions (within \u00b1 25% range of standard) and a relative retention time \nmatch (\u00b1 3 s.d. range of standard) were required [22]. \n \nGC-FID Analysis \nSqualene analysis was carried out on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 500 Gas Chromatograph with flame ionisation \ndetection (GC-FID), using a CP Sil 5CB column (15 m x 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 \u03bcm 100% \ndimethylpolysiloxane film thickness, Varian, Lake Forest, CA).  A 1 \u03bcL aliquot was injected in splitless \nmode in duplicate.  The column was held at 65 oC for 10 minutes, ramped to 125 oC at 10 oC min-1 and held \nfor 5 minutes.  It was then ramped at 10 oC min-1 to 170 oC, held for 2 minutes, ramped at 5 oC min-1 to 250 \noC and held for a further 5 minutes.  Squalene calibration standards, \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 fingerprint \nsamples and negative controls were injected in duplicate and analysed as described. \n \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 9\nStatistical analysis \nStatistical analyses (t-tests and paired t-tests) were performed using SPSS 14.0, with 95 % (P < 0.05) \nconfidence level to determine significant quantitative differences between donors for each compound.  \nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the amino acid, fatty acid and squalene quantitative \ndata using TANAGRA version 1.4.31 to identify similarities and differences between donors and sample \ntypes [23]. \n  \nResults and Discussion \nLatent fingerprints were collected on a non-porous substrate from a small population of donors.  Amino \nacids and fatty acids were extracted and derivatised to form N(O,S)-ethoxycarbonyl amino acid ethyl esters \nand fatty acid ethyl esters respectively, which were identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass \nspectrometry (Table 2). \n \nEighteen donors participated, nine males and nine females, ranging in age between 18 and 57 years old \n(Table 1).  Four donors were vegetarian and four were smokers.  A number of donors were taking \nmedication and several were wearing cosmetic products or had used a moisturiser on the day of sample \ncollection.  Two types of fingerprints were collected from each donor.  In the first instance \u2018natural\u2019 \nfingerprints were collected with no specific pre-treatment.  Donors were only requested to have not washed \ntheir hands in the hour preceding sampling.  For the second \u2018groomed\u2019 sample, donors were instructed to \nrub their fingers across their forehead and the region around the nose.  This activity loads the fingertips \nwith sebaceous secretions, which are abundant on the face [24,25].  This \u2018grooming\u2019 activity is often used \nin fingerprint studies prior to fingerprint deposition.  The donor\u2019s fingers were applied to the substrate by \nthe researcher to ensure that fingertip area sampled, time of contact and pressure were as consistent as \npossible between donors. \n \nAll fingerprint samples were analysed in SIM mode for identification and quantification of amino acids and \nfatty acids listed in Table 2.  Compounds were identified on the basis of relative retention time (RRT) and \nion ratio matches.   \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 10\n \nFingerprint profiles \nIndividual variation is apparent when the total ion chromatograms (TIC) are compared (Figure 1).  \nQualitative (number of peaks present) and quantitative (peak size) differences can be seen between \nindividuals and also between the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 samples (note the differences in ordinate scales).  \nTarget compound chromatograms (TCC) further emphasise sample variation (Figure 2).  To construct the \nTCC, target compounds (fatty acids and amino acids listed in Table 2 in addition to squalene) were \nidentified in the TIC and the base peak ion of the mass spectrum quantified and plotted against retention \ntime.  It should be noted that the ordinates in the TIC and the TCC are total detector response and base peak \nion area respectively, and therefore the relative distribution of target compounds appears different in the \ntwo chromatograms.  The TCC is simpler than its corresponding TIC allowing for more effective \ncomparison and pattern recognition.  Background compounds, which include phthalates such as diethyl-, \ndibutyl- and bis(2-ethylhexyl)- thought to arise from the Mylar\u00ae film (also present in the negative controls), \nare particularly prominent in the TIC (for example 14.78, 15.10, 17.60 and 26.39 minutes) but are not \nincluded in the TCC. \n \nFatty acid composition \nOctanoic acid, decanoic acid, undecanoic acid, dodecanoic acid and cis-9-tetradecenoic acid gave quadratic \ncalibration curves over the range 5-1200 nmol mL-1 with a correlation coefficient (R2) exceeding 0.99 in all \ncases with the exception of octanoic acid (0.92) and undecanoic acid (0.97).  All other fatty acids gave \nlinear calibration curves over the same concentration range, with R2 values exceeding 0.99 in most cases \nand 0.97 in all.  For quantification all samples were corrected using appropriate blanks.  Dodecanoic acid, \ntetradecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid and cis-9-octadecenoic acid \nwere positively identified in all samples and in most cases exceeded the limit of quantification (200 \u2013 394 \nng deposited, mean blank + 10 standard deviations, [26]).  Tridecanoic acid, cis-9-hexadecenoic acid, \nheptadecanoic acid, cis-9,12-octadecadienoic acid, eicosanoic acid and tetracosanoic acid were positively \nidentified and above the limit of detection (96 \u2013 464 ng deposited, mean blank + 3 standard deviations [26]) \nin some samples but not above the limit of quantification in most cases (137 \u2013 570 ng deposited).  The \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 11\nremaining fatty acids, octanoic, decanoic, undecanoic and cis-9-tetradecenoic acids, were not positively \nidentified in any fingerprint samples. \n \nTotal fatty acid deposited ranged from 0.16 to 3.37 \u03bcg per fingerprint, for those positively identified.  There \nis wide variation in the relative amounts of each fatty acid found in the latent fingerprint samples (Figure \n3).  Hexadecanoic acid was the most abundant in all samples followed by octadecanoic acid and cis-9-\noctadecenoic acid, consistent with previously published data [13,15,27].  Quantitative differences were \nfound between the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 fingerprint samples (Figure 3a).  Significantly (P < 0.05) \ngreater amounts of fatty acids were deposited in the latter, consistent with the act of \u2018grooming\u2019 and \ntouching sebum-rich areas of the face immediately prior to depositing the fingerprints.  In Figure 3b the \namount of each fatty acid is normalised to hexadecanoic acid in the sample.  The qualitative differences \nbetween the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 sample types were less marked.   \n \nVariation is evident in the distribution of individual fatty acids between donors (Figure 3).  This may be \ndue to donor-dependent factors such as diet or cosmetic use.  Comparison of the differences between the \ntwo sample types for individual donors reveals further variation.  The increase in individual fatty acids after \nthe act of grooming varied from 1% (\u2018natural\u2019 sample 29.93 ng tetradecanoic acid per fingerprint, \n\u2018groomed\u2019 sample 30.23 ng) to over 2000% (28.54 to 650.92 ng cis-9-octadecenoic acid).  The decrease in \nmaterial deposited varied from 12% (43.39 to 38.26 ng octadecanoic acid) to almost complete absence.  \nThe percentage increase or decrease for any given donor was not consistent for all fatty acids indicating \ndifferential distribution on both the fingertips and the face.  Overall, the increase in total fatty acid after \ngrooming was 22-2000%, which clearly demonstrates the significant impact the sampling protocol has on \nthe chemical composition of the latent fingerprints deposited. \n \nOnly one donor, Donor 18, deposited less material overall in their \u2018groomed\u2019 sample (4.5%) compared to \ntheir \u2018natural\u2019 sample.  Whilst there was an overall decline in fatty acid deposited, there was an increase \nseen for hexadecanoic (5%), cis-9-octadecenoic (8%), and octadecanoic acids (17%).  Donor 18 was an 18-\nyear-old female donor, who reported taking the antibiotic erythromycin.  Antibiotics affect  bacterial lipase \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 12\nactivity responsible for the hydrolysis of triglycerides in sebum secreted onto the skin and therefore would  \nreduce the levels of selected free fatty acids available to be picked up during \u2018grooming\u2019 [28].  The sample \npopulation in this study is, however, limited.   \n \nThe relative distribution of tetradecanoic, octadecanoic and cis-9-octadecenoic acids (normalised using \nhexadecanoic acid) in the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 samples were consistent with the studies of Mong et al. \n[13] and Archer et al. [15], with the exception of octadecanoic acid which was present in greater relative \namounts in the latter study.  Mong et al. and Archer et al.  collected fingerprints on filter paper and their \nsampling protocols included the donors rubbing their fingertips across the forehead prior to depositing \nfingerprints.  Consequently absolute quantitative comparisons are difficult between the studies.   \n  \nAmino acid composition \nAll amino acids gave linear calibration curves over the concentration range 1.25-200 nmol mL-1 with R2 \nvalues exceeding 0.99 in most cases and 0.95 in all.  Arginine, cystine, and histidine were not detected in \nany calibration standards or fingerprint samples.  Hydroxyproline, methionine and tryptophan were not \npositively identified in any fingerprint samples, consistent with previous studies where they were detected \nat very low levels or not at all [18,19,20].  Lysine, ornithine and tyrosine were detected and positively \nidentified in most fingerprint samples.  However, they behaved inconsistently in the calibration standards \nand therefore accurate quantification was not possible in this study.  These amino acids will not be \ndiscussed further. \n \nGlycine, valine, leucine, serine, proline, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, phenylalanine and \ncysteine were positively identified in all fingerprint samples with a few exceptions.  Alanine was at least \npartially identified (one ion ratio or more) in most samples.  Qualitative ion peaks (70, 144, 189 m\/z) were \noften difficult to integrate or absent.  No ion ratio matches were found for isoleucine in approximately half \nof the samples.  Threonine was positively identified in most samples but was not found in levels greater \nthan the negative controls in any samples except two.  In most cases all samples were found to be above the \nlimit of quantification for most amino acids (15.5 \u2013 28.1 ng deposited).  \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 13\n \nSerine was the most abundant amino acid followed by glycine, alanine and aspartic acid.  The relative \nabundance of amino acids was in general consistent with previously published studies [18,19,20].  Wide \nvariation is observed between the donors with total amino acid deposited ranging from 20.7 to 345.1 ng per \nfingerprint.  There is no correlation between total amount of fatty acid and total amino acid deposited in the \n\u2018natural\u2019 fingerprint samples (Figure 4a) as expected since they are predominantly from different sources, \nnamely sebaceous secretions and eccrine sweat respectively.  There is also no correlation for the \u2018groomed\u2019 \nfingerprint samples (Figure 4b). \n \nThe significant quantitative differences between the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 fingerprint samples seen for \nthe fatty acids were not observed in the case of the amino acids (P > 0.05, Figure 5a).  The data indicate \nthat the predominantly lipid material, picked up on the fingertips during the \u2018grooming\u2019 procedure, did not \ninhibit the extraction of amino acids from the fingerprint using this experimental procedure.  If this had \nbeen the case, the amino acid levels in the \u2018groomed\u2019 samples would have been consistently lower.  For \nover half of the donors (n = 10) there was a decline in the total amount of amino acid deposited in the \n\u2018groomed\u2019 sample compared to the \u2018natural\u2019 sample and an increase for the remaining donors.  A consistent \nincrease (or decrease) was not always seen, however, for all individual amino acids for a given donor.  For \nsome donors, selected amino acids were only found in either the \u2018groomed\u2019 or the \u2018natural\u2019 sample.  In the \nsampling protocol employed, the \u2018natural\u2019 sample was collected first and there was a minimal time delay \nbefore the collection of the \u2018groomed\u2019 sample (typically 10 minutes, exact time dependent on length of time \ntaken to deposit all fingerprint samples and conduct \u2018grooming\u2019 procedure).  It is expected that the amino \nacids present on the fingertips are depleted to some extent in the first fingerprint sample and are not \nreplenished by the \u2018grooming\u2019 procedure and thus lower amounts of amino acids are expected in the \n\u2018groomed\u2019 samples.  The interactions between the eccrine and sebaceous components on the fingertip and \nwith the non-porous substrate are not clearly understood.  It may be that the amino acids were not fully \ndepleted in the first sample.  Amino acids may be picked up on the fingertips from the forehead during \ngrooming [29,30].  Qualitatively, the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 samples were comparable, with the \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 14\nexceptions of the relative amounts of alanine and glycine, which appear to be more abundant in the former \n(Figure 5b).  The differences in relative abundance were significant in the case of glycine (P < 0.05). \n \nSqualene \nSqualene was identified in the fingerprint samples by mass spectral analysis and consequently the \nfingerprint samples were re-analysed by GC-FID for quantification.  The squalene content of the fingerprint \nsamples is summarised in Figure 6.  Significantly greater amounts of squalene were deposited in the \n\u2018groomed\u2019 sample compared to the \u2018natural\u2019 sample (P < 0.001).  The amount of squalene increased by \nbetween 1.5 to 68.4 times, as expected since squalene is derived from sebaceous secretions [24,25].  As \nseen for the fatty acids, quantitative variation was evident between donors.  For example, the \u2018natural\u2019 \nfingerprint samples of Donor 4 and Donor 17 contained comparable amounts of squalene, 124.25 and \n124.24 ng per fingerprint respectively.  However, their \u2018groomed\u2019 samples were very different with that of \nDonor 4 (1282.00 ng) containing more than double Donor 17\u2019s sample (623.15 ng).  Squalene was not \nfound in the \u2018natural\u2019 samples of Donor 9 and following \u2018grooming\u2019 283.01 ng per fingerprint were \ndeposited.   \n \nThe relative squalene content (normalised to hexadecanoic acid) of the samples in this study were again \ncompared with those of Mong et al. [13] and Archer et al. [15].  The \u2018groomed\u2019 samples were comparable \nto those of Mong et al., whilst the \u2018natural\u2019 samples were lower and comparable to the Archer et al. \nsamples. \n  \nIndividual variation and personal traits \nCharacteristic compounds may be found in a latent fingerprint which could potentially be exploited to \nprovide donor information such as age or a personal habit [4,5,31].  The individual amino acid and fatty \nacid composition data were studied to determine whether any quantitative variation arose as a consequence \nof a particular donor attribute, namely gender, diet, age and smoking. \n \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 15\nGender differences in the amino acid content of sweat have been reported previously [30].  Individual mean \namino acid levels were higher in females (n = 9) compared to males (n = 9) but only in the case of \nasparagine in the \u2018natural\u2019 samples was this difference significant (P < 0.05).  Conversely, for most fatty \nacids the mean amount per fingerprint was higher in the male samples compared to the female samples, \nalthough this was not significant (P > 0.05).  Penn et al. [32] reported that pentadecanoic, hexadecanoic and \nheptadecanoic acids in axillary sweat were characteristic of male subjects.  Pentadecanoic and \nhexadecanoic acids were found in this study to be in greater abundance in the male \u2018groomed\u2019 samples \ncompared to the female \u2018groomed\u2019 samples, although this was not significant (P > 0.05).  Quantitative \ndifferences between the \u2018ungroomed\u2019 samples were smaller.  It should be noted that individual quantitative \ndifferences may arise as a consequence of differences in fingerprint surface area. \n \nAmino acid content was found to differ between the vegetarian donors (n = 4) and those with an \nomnivorous diet (n = 14).  In the \u2018natural\u2019 samples most amino acids were comparable.  The mean amount \nof alanine, glycine and serine was higher for the vegetarian donors although not significantly (P > 0.1).  \nThese differences were not evident in the \u2018groomed\u2019 samples.  For the fatty acids, composition was \ncomparable for the \u2018natural\u2019 samples.  Pentadecanoic acid, however, differed significantly between the \nomnivores and vegetarians (P < 0.05).  Comparing the \u2018groomed\u2019 samples, mean amounts were higher in \nthe omnivore samples compared to the vegetarians.  Striking differences were evident for hexadecanoic and \ncis-9-octadecenoic acids, although a significant difference was found only for the latter (P < 0.01). \n \nNo significant differences were found between the non-smokers (n = 14) and the smokers (n = 4) for any \namino acid or fatty acid.  The donors were arbitrarily divided into \u201820 years and under\u2019 (n = 12) and \u201821 \nyears and over\u2019 (n = 6) groups.  Significant differences (P < 0.05) between the two groups were found for \nalanine, glycine and valine in the \u2018natural\u2019 samples.  In the case of the fatty acids, a significant difference \nwas seen only for dodecanoic acid in the \u2018natural\u2019 samples (P < 0.05). \n \nBased on this limited quantitative data, no compound has been identified as a marker for a particular donor \ntrait.  This was as expected since these compounds are generic and commonly found in sweat and \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 16\nsebaceous secretions.  It should be noted that the variation seen will not be mutually exclusive and only due \nto one particular donor trait, but will be a consequence of a combination of contributory factors. \n \nPrinciple component analysis was performed of the entire target compound quantitative data in order to \ndetermine whether it is possible to differentiate different sample types using all compounds.  Figure 7 \nshows the principle component scores plot of PCA1 and PCA2, which account for 82% of the variance \nobserved in the population.  The scores plot illustrates that the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 samples may be \ndifferentiated although there is some overlap.  The differences between the male and female samples are \nless marked.  As expected the fatty acid and squalene variables showed close correlation and were \nnegatively correlated to the amino acids along PCA2.  This would suggest that PCA2 gives discrimination \nbetween \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 samples of which there is some evidence in Figure 7 and is consistent \nwith the observations in Figures 3 and 5.  There was no discrimination between samples on the basis of the \nother donor attributes namely diet, age and smoking.  \n \n  \n \nConclusions \nThis study further develops our current understanding of latent fingerprint composition.  The amino acid, \nfatty acid and squalene composition of latent fingerprints was found to vary quantitatively between \nindividual donors in this study.  Whilst many of the compounds studied were found to be common to all \nsamples, the relative amounts were found to differ.  The impact of the sampling protocol on the quantitative \nanalysis of fingerprints has also been clearly demonstrated.  The act of \u2018grooming\u2019 prior to depositing latent \nfingerprints had a significant effect quantitatively, and to a lesser extent qualitatively, on the fatty acid \ncomposition of the samples.  Although the same marked effect was not seen for all amino acids, \u2018grooming\u2019 \ndid affect some.  Principal component analysis allowed the differentiation of the \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018groomed\u2019 \nfingerprint samples.  There was no such differentiation found on the basis of gender, diet, age or smoking. \n \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 17\nThe need to consider the sampling protocol when conducting and evaluating latent fingerprint studies has \nbeen highlighted.  Analyses here indicate that the use of \u2018groomed\u2019 or \u2018enhanced\u2019 fingerprints could \nseriously compromise the validity of fingerprint reagent assessments. This would be particularly so with \nregard to reagents for sebaceous components where, on average, fatty acid content could be over \nrepresented by a factor of four. Squalene could be over represented by a factor of sixteen and total \nsebaceous mass over represented by a factor of six. Use of \u2018natural\u2019 fingerprints is therefore recommended \nfor all trials of reagents.   \nForensic Sci. Int., 2010, Vol. 199, 93-102 \n \n 18\nReferences \n[1] V.
