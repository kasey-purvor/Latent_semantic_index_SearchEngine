Introduction\n[2] Stability properties of space current sheets (CS)\ndepend on the sheet parameters as well as on how the\nequilibrium is established. The most well-known 1-d current\nsheet model has a broad maximum of current density in the\nsheet center. Other possibilities can include a strong con-\ncentration of the current in the central region due to the ion\ninertia forces in an anisotropic plasma [Sitnov et al., 2000],\nor more complicated distributions with double off-center\npeaks. Such bifurcated current sheet, for example, can be\nborn in the plasma outflow region when the magnetic\nreconnection process is operating [e.g., Arzner and Scholer,\n2001]. Whether and where bifurcated current sheets really\noccur in space, and whether they are an important constit-\nuent of the explosive dissipative process responsible for the\nsubstorms, are still open questions.\n[3] The observational evidence for bifurcated current\nsheets is yet very scarce. Previous studies with ISEE-1\/2\ndual s\/c system gave only one example of a bifurcated thin\ncurrent sheet [Sergeev et al., 1993]. Other arguments for the\nexistence of bifurcated CS have been given by Hoshino et\nal. [1996] although they refer to the distant tail plasma\nsheet, where the properties are different from those in the\nnear- and mid-tail regions. Further evidence of current\nbifurcation has been recently given by Asano [2001] who\nstatistically analysed current densities obtained from ion and\nelectron velocities measured by the Geotail spacecraft.\n[4] Reconstruction of the spatial profile of plasma param-\neters (including electric current) in the time-varying plasma\nsheet can be done with Cluster observations if the spacecraft\nrepeatedly crosses the current sheet. This occurs when the\nvertical oscillating motions of the plasma sheet (flapping\nmotions) have a large amplitude. The origin and the nature\nof such waves also have not yet been established, although\nthey carry important information on the processes destabi-\nlizing the current sheet. Because of difficulties to study\nthem with a single s\/c there are only few attempts [e.g.,\nToyichi and Miyasaki, 1976; Bauer et al., 1995; Sergeev et\nal., 1998] yet with no consistent mode identification.\n2. Observations and Data Analysis\n[5] At 22 UT on September 26, 2001, Cluster was located\nat [\u000318; +7; 0] RE (in GSM coordinates, used everywhere if\nnot mentioned otherwise) near the plasma sheet northern\nboundary. The IMF was mostly northward during preceed-\ning hours, so the magnetic activity was low. Distinct sudden\nactivation of the westward auroral electrojet was recorded at\n2223 UT near midnight in the center of the IMAGE ground-\nbased network, with maximum negative magnetic bay\namplitude (\u0001140 nT) at the MAS station (Figure 1). The\nquicklook of the WIC camera on the IMAGE satellite\nconfirmed that the auroral brightening occurred at 2223\nUT in the 21\u201324 MLT sector. Pi2 pulsation onset was\nrecorded at 2224 UT on subauroral stations of the SAMNET\nnetwork (not shown). Another feature of interest in the\ncontext of our study is a factor of 2 drop of solar wind\ndensity (and dynamic pressure, PD). It was later recorded as\na sudden negative impulse (\u0003SI in Figure 1) at \u00012216 UT\nby GOES-10 in the dayside magnetosphere. The onset of\nintense flapping motion at X \u0001\u000318 RE was observed by the\nCluster s\/c after 2218 UT, a few minutes before the ground\nonset of substorm activation. Five s\/c entries to the plasma\nsheet from the lobe were observed while the first (at \u00012218\nUT) not of interest as three of the four s\/c stayed in the lobe.\n[6] Figure 2 displays the detailed view of observations\nduring the oscillations A to C which have an apparent\nperiod of \u00013 min. The upper plot shows an intercomparison\nbetween the Ey electric field component measured by the\nEFW instrument (double probe) [Gustafsson et al., 2001]\nand the y-component of Vp \u0004 B (Vp is the proton velocity\nfrom CIS-1 mass spectrometer [Re\u00b4me et al., 2001], B is the\nmagnetic field vector from [Balogh et al., 2001]).\n[7] Being confident in the quality of plasma measure-\nments, we now integrate Vpz to visualize the flapping\noscillation and to get an estimate of its vertical scale.\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 30, NO. 6, 1327, doi:10.1029\/2002GL016500, 2003\n1Institute of Physics, St. Petersburg University, St. Petersburg, Russia.\n2Institut fu\u00a8r Weltraumforschung der O\u00a8AW, Graz, Austria.\n3Imperial College, London, UK.\n4CESR\/CNRS, Toulouse, France.\n5Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Uppsala, Sweden.\n6Max-Planck-Institut fu\u00a8r extraterrestrische Physik, Garching, Germany.\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/03\/2002GL016500$05.00\n60 - 1\nIndeed, this gives a similar variation at both s\/c #1 and #3\n(Figure 2b) consistent with the flapping-related Bx variation\n(Figure 2c). It also shows a clear trend: it is larger at s\/c #1,\nwhich stayed above the neutral sheet and can be interpreted\nas contribution from the convection plus some spurious\neffects. In the following analysis we use detrended data with\nthe trend computed over the time interval from 2216 UT till\n2250 UT, which had slopes of 21.5 km\/s and 16.8 km\/s at s\/\nc #1 and #3. This will be referred to as the vertical distance\nZ* and used below in the Figure 3.\n[8] To analyse the flapping oscillation in more detail we\nuse inter-s\/c timing as well as Minimum Variance Analysis.\nThe MVA in our case was applied to the short (15\u201330 s)\ntime intervals during which the s\/c crossed from the lobe\nboundary to the neutral sheet or vice versa. They character-\nize a part of the upward\/downward phase of the current\nsheet oscillatory motion in either the northern half (data\nfrom all s\/c) or the southern half (only #3 provides data) of\nthe current sheet. 20 of 21 MVA determinations gave well-\nresolved MVA normals (with intermediate-to-minimal\neigenvalue ratio exceeding 3). Their projections to the Y-Z\nplane are displayed in Figure 2d, the x-component of the\nnormal is always smaller as compared to nY and nZ, so the\ntilt in X-Z plane is insignificant.\n[9] The most consistent results come from data of s\/c #3,\nwhich crossed the entire sheet between the two lobes. It\nshows the opposite Y-slopes at upward\/downward phases of\nthe flapping oscillation, which have the same sense in the\nnorthern and southern halves of the current sheet for each\nphase. The same sense of sheet tilt in northern and southern\nregions implies that the sheet is tilted as a whole (suggesting\nkink mode) rather than being locally expanded and con-\ntracted (like in the sausage wave). Other s\/c show typically\nsmaller slopes of the normal (probing only part of the\noscillations), in many cases their average (except for\nupward phases of oscillations A and B) are of the same\nsense and agree with s\/c #3.\n[10] The timing of the Bx component records at four s\/c\n(Figure 2c) confirms essentially this MVA-based picture.\nFirst, it shows a well-ordered vertical structure of the current\nsheet (BX3 is always much smaller than BX1 if not in the\nlobes, consistent with s\/c #3 being at smaller Z than other\nthree s\/c, see Figure 1). For other s\/c having nearly the same\nZ coordinate, the variations are similar with a small time\ndelay between #1 and #4 but a large delay between those\nand s\/c #2. This agrees with the sheet tilting mostly in the Y-\nZ plane. The time delay from #1, 4 to #2 varied between 23 s\nand 41 s for the upward and downward parts of oscillations\nA, B, and C, which corresponds to a duskward propagation\nof the large-scale wave with a wavelength in Y-direction\nabout 2 RE. This length is comparable to the vertical\nflapping amplitude which is \u00011 RE from Figure 2b (if\nsubtracting the trend). The largest tilt of the sheet in Y-Z\nplane was observed for oscillation B (60\u0001\u201375\u0001 according to\ns\/c #3 data). This is consistent with other sources: it has the\nFigure 1.

According to Sergeev et al., [1998]\nin the case of good linear correlation between Vz and dBx\/dt\nthe regression coefficient v gives information about the\naverage gradient dBx\/dz, allowing to infer the current\ndensity and current sheet scale. Figure 3a demonstrate a\ngood anticorrelation (correlation coefficients \u00030.79 and\n\u00030.74) between these quantities. The average slope of\n\u000185 km\/nT corresponds to of \u00019.4 nA\/m2, and the average\nCS half-thickness (ha \u0005 BL\/(dBx\/dz) = BLn) appears to be ha\n\u00012300 km =0.36 RE (with BL = 27 nT). Another method\ncould use the apparent distance of s\/c from the neutral sheet\nZS* = Z0 \u0003\nR\nVzdt (with subtracted long-term trend, as\nmentioned above, and Z0 chosen to get ZS* = 0 at the neutral\nsheet, where Bx = 0). Data from both s\/c (#1 and #3 in\nFigures 3b and 3c) show remarkable similarity in all\nindividual crossings: they indicate a reduced dBx\/dz in the\ncentral part of the current sheet (where Bx \u0006 BL), and\nenhanced gradient (enhanced current density) concentrated\nin the boundary part (in most cases between Bx = 10 nT and\n20 nT). The half-thickness of the whole sheet is comparable\nto the average above obtained (2300 km), with the thickness\nof concentrated current \u0001500 to 1000 km and maximal\ncurrent densities of 20 nA\/m2. These values give the upper\nlimit of the actual CS thickness as the method ignores the\ntilt \u0001 of the current sheet in Y\u2013Z plane which could be quite\nsignificant.\n[12] Following the approach by Sergeev et al. [1993] and\nassuming a 1D current sheet, we use the difference dBx =\nBx1\u2013Bx3 of the X-components measured by s\/c #1 and #3,\nwhich gives us the total current in the horizontal slab\nbetween two s\/c. With the s\/c separation dZ13 it gives the\ncurrent density simply as jy = dBx13\/(m0dZ13 cos \u0001), where \u0001\nis the angle between Z-axis and the normal to the sheet. As a\nlabel of position in the current sheet where this current\ndensity has to be assigned, we use the Bx component value\nin the mid point, that is Bxa = 0.5(Bx3 + Bx1). This gives us\nthe relative vertical distance (with Bx = 0 at the center).\n[13] Hodograms of dBx versus Bxa at the top of Figure 4\nshow that initially (crossing A, showing most severe and\ncomplicated variations) the dynamics is very complicated,\nbeing possibly dominated by transient and\/or wave features.\nThen, starting from the most deep plasma sheet crossing B\n(after 2225:20 UT) the trajectory displays a systematic\nbehaviour, with a deep local minimum in the central part\n(where Bx \u0001 0) and the maximum dBx at |Bx| \u000115 nT. This\nbehaviour is repeated in the crossings C, D, so this bifur-\ncated current structure was nearly stable for the next \u000115\nminutes. The dBx value at the current maximum evolved\nfrom \u000125 nT (B) to \u000117 nT (C) and \u000112 nT (D), consistent\nwith the \u00012 times current sheet broadening during that time\ninterval. Note that the 20 nT difference at the large separa-\ntion dZ13 = 1560 km gives \u000110 nA\/m2, which is the lower\nlimit for the current density in the maximum region. The\nbottom panel in Figure 4 shows the occurrence rate of\nmagnetic field Bx values; here we used the merged 1 s data\nfrom s\/c #1 and #3 between 2220 and 2240 UT. As argued\nby Hoshino et al. [1996], in the case of constant flapping\nvelocity Vz the Bx-occurrence frequency is inversely propor-\ntional to the vertical Bx gradients, so the peaks in the current\ndensity ( jy \u0001 dBx\/dz) should correspond to minima in the\noccurrence rate. Taking into account that the occurrence rate\nis skewed toward the northern lobe, where s\/c #1 stayed\nmost of time (this trend is marked by the dashed line on the\nplot), this occurrence plot shows excellent agreement with\nthe dBz vs. Bxa profiles. Both methods confirm the findings\nFigure 3. (a) Relationship between Vz and dBx\/dt in the\nflapping current sheet, (b,c) Bx profiles vs. the Z* scale\nobtained by Vz integration for individual crossings, across\nthe neutral sheet (where Z* = 0).

The most clear pattern was found\nfor the density which shows a plateau in the broad central\nregion between the peaks of bifurcated current as well as\nsharp decreases towards the lobe-plasma sheet boundary.\nNo special features are noticed in x- and y-components of\nthe proton flow. Particularly, the dawnward Vy (opposite to\nthe direction of cross-tail current) shows no peculiar feature\nin the current maximum region. This may be an indication\nthat the bifurcated current is supported by electrons. We\nfailed to find the quadrupole By perturbation near the current\nmaximum region which is expected to be generated by the\nHall currents near the reconnection region [e.g., Arzner and\nScholer, 2001] and conclude that, if existed, it was too weak\n(less than a few nT) and masked by the strong noise.\n3. Discussion and Concluding Remarks\n[15] Main results of this study are the interesting proper-\nties of the flapping wave allowing to identify it as the kink\nmode, and reliable identification of the current bifurcation.\nBoth results have considerable support in recent observa-\ntions made also during substorms. Runov et al. [2002]\nreported MVA results indicating that the basic tilt of the\nplasma sheet in the flapping wave is in the Y-Z plane, they\nalso inferred that the basic propagation is in the Y-direction\nfrom the timing analysis at Cluster s\/c. Our results extend\nthese findings and also show the consistence of normals\ndetermined in northern and southern halves of the sheet with\nthe kink mode character of the flapping wave.\n[16] Signatures of bifurcated current were recently\nreported by Nakamura et al. [2002] in an onset-associated\nfast Earthward flow and by Runov et al. [2002] during a\nsubstorm activation. Double off-center peaks of the current\ndensity shown in our study (Figure 4, top) resemble the\nprofiles inferred by Sergeev et al. [1993] (during substorm\nactivation with strong Earthward flow pulse) and Runov et\nal. [2002], which also displayed a peak at Bx \u0001 0.5BL and a\nfactor 2\u20133 difference between off-center current density\npeak and current minimum at the center. Our results extend\nthese findings in that (1) three different methods gave the\nsame results, and (2) the bifurcated current picture was\nfound to be stable as it repeated a few times during \u000115 min\nof flapping wave observations.\n[17] However unlike previous studies in our event there\nwere no strong flows: Vpx rarely exceed +200 km\/s, which is\nmuch less than the expected Alfven speed in the lobes.\nStagnant bifurcated current sheets have been sometimes met\nin the analysis made by Hoshino et al. [1996]. This feature\nmakes it questionable that reconnection is the ultimate\nreason of the bifurcated structure. A process of a thin\ncurrent sheet \u2018\u2018aging\u2019\u2019, described by Zelenyi et al. [2002],\nmay be an alternative mechanism of the CS bifurcation.\n[18] Acknowledgments.
