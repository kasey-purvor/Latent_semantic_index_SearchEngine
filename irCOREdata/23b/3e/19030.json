POR\nfacilitates electron transfer from NADPH to key enzymes\ninvolved in glucocorticoid and sex steroid synthesis,\n17a-hydroxylase\/17,20 lyase (CYP17A1), CYP21A2\n(21-hydroxylase) and CYP19A1 (aromatase). There-\nfore, mutant POR results in clinical presentation with\ndisordered sex development (DSD) and glucocorticoid\ndeficiency (1, 2). Intriguingly, individuals of both sexes\nmay present with DSD, i.e. 46,XX DSD and 46,XY DSD.\nWhile undervirilization of affected male individuals is\nreadily explained by insufficient sex steroid synthesis,\nvirilization in girls is thought to be consequent to the\nexaggerated activity of an alternative pathway towards\nandrogen synthesis that is active in fetal life and ceasesndocrinology\ne distributed under the terms of the European J\nnd reproduction in any medium, provided the oriactivity shortly after birth (1). Individuals affected by\nORD also often present with skeletal malformations,\nmost likely consequent to impaired synthesis of\ncholesterol (4, 5) and retinoic acid metabolism (6),\nboth of which play a crucial role in the regulation of\nfetal bone development and growth (5, 7).\nIn addition to facilitating steroid and sterol synthesis,\nPOR provides electrons to all major drug-metabolizing\ncytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, and thus it is\nconceivable that mutant POR will also disrupt drug\nand xenobiotic metabolism (Fig. 1). Five CYP enzymes\n(CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4)\nare responsible for the metabolism of more than 80% of\nall drugs (8). CYP3A4 represents the major player\ninvolved in the metabolism of more than half of existing\ndrugs, notably also in the inactivation of steroid\nhormones including glucocorticoids and sex steroids (9).\nA functional impact of sequence variants in the POR\ngene on hepatic drug metabolism by POR sequence hasDOI: 10.1530\/EJE-10-0764\nOnline version via www.eje-online.org\nournal of Endocrinology\u2019s Re-use Licence which permits unrestricted non-\nginal work is properly cited.\nPOR\nSteroid synthesis\n(sex steroids,\nglucocorticoids)\nCYP17A1\nPOR\nDHEA\nPOR\nSterol synthesis\nand retinoic acid\nmetabolism\nCYP51A1\nSQLE CYP26C1\nHepatic phase 1\ndrug-metabolism\nCYP1A2\nCYP3A4\nCYP2D6\nCYP2C9 CYP2C19\nPOR\nPOR\nPOR POR\nPOR\nPOR\nPORPOR\nCYP26A1\nPOR CYP26B1\nPOR\nCYP21A2\nCortisol\nCYP19A1\nPOR\n17\u03b2-oestradiol\nHO\nHO\nO\nHO\nHO OH\nO\nO\nH H\nH\nOH\nFigure 1 P450 oxidoreductase (POR) transfers electrons to all\nmicrosomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.

Here, we have studied the activities of\nthe five major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes in two\nindividuals carrying the POR variant A287P, the most\nfrequently observed disease-causing POR mutation in\nCaucasians.Subjects and methods\nSubjects\nA 48-year-old patient with congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia due to ORD and her clinically unaffected\n72-year-old mother participated in the study. The\nneonatal and pubertal presentation of this patient has\nbeen reported elsewhere (J Idkowiak, unpublished\nobservations); in brief, she presented at birth with\nseverely virilized external genitalia, i.e. 46,XX DSD, and\nwas wrongly assigned to the male gender. At the age of\n5 years, sex reassignment was prompted by the birth ofwww.eje-online.orga virilized sister. Owing to lack of spontaneous pubertal\ndevelopment, puberty had been induced at the age of\n17 years by equine oestrogens and progesterone.\nDetailed assessment at the age of 24 years revealed\nelevated serum progesterone and 17OH-progesterone,\nlow serum androgens, partial adrenal insufficiency with\nan impaired cortisol response to ACTH stimulation and\nclinical and radiological evidence of mild dysmorphic\nfeatures (low set ears, clinodactyly, camptodactyly and\nbrachydactyly). Blood pressure was elevated on\nrepeated measurements (systolic 140\u2013160 mmHg and\ndiastolic 90\u201395 mmHg).\nOestrogen\/progestin replacement was continued\nuntil the age of 37 years, when she was diagnosed\nwith breast cancer, despite a negative family history. The\ntumour was 3 cm in diameter, with a mixed histological\npicture featuring foci of ductal adenocarcinoma as well\nas stromal myxoid changes; tumour tissue was negative\nfor oestrogen and progesterone receptor staining and\nHer-2\/neu amplification. Oestrogen\/progestin replace-\nment was stopped post surgical follow-up until her\ncurrent age of 49 years did not reveal a recurrence.Methods\nPOR and CYP enzyme genotyping To ascertain the\ndiagnosis of ORD, genetic analyses were performed after\nobtaining written informed consent and with approval\nof the South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee.\nThe coding region of the POR gene (GeneID 5447) was\namplified as previously described (1), employing\ngenomic DNA from the patient and her mother.\nIn addition to POR sequencing, we performed\ngenotyping for common variant alleles of the genes\nencoding the major drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes\nsince such sequence variants have been shown to\ncontribute to an individual\u2019s drug response. Analyses\nincluded the determination of variant alleles *2 and *3\nof CYP2C9 (15), allele *2 of CYP2C19 (16) and alleles\n*3, *4, *5, *6 and the gene duplication of CYP2D6 (17).\n*n denotes the individual allele as decided by the Human\nCYP Allele Nomenclature Committee (http:\/\/www.\ncypalleles.ki.se\/).\nIn vivo low dose cocktail phenotyping Both subjects\nunderwent in vivo phenotyping to assess the activities of\nthe major hepatic drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes\ncarried out after obtaining informed consent and with\napproval of the ethics committee of the University\nHospital Cologne. Low doses of validated substrates\nselective for each of the five major drug-metabolizing\nCYP enzymes were orally administered simultaneously\nas a \u2018cocktail\u2019 (Table 1), thereby allowing for estimation\nof several metabolic pathways in a single assessment\n(18).

CYP2D6 genotyping found\nCYP2D6 gene duplication in subject 1 (patient),\nconsistent with an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype,\nwhile variant alleles identified in subject 2 (mother)\npredicted a rapid metabolizer phenotype (Table 2).\nHowever, despite CYP genotyping results predictive of\nnormal to high enzymatic activities, in vivo drug cocktail\nphenotyping revealed low activities of all tested CYP\nenzymes in both subjects (Fig. 2). The patient and her\nmother had similarly decreased activities of CYP1A2\n(oral caffeine clearance (ml\/min per kg body weight);\nsubject 1, 0.25; subject 2, 0.35) and CYP2C9 (plasma\ntolbutamide concentration 24 h post dose (mg\/ml);\nsubject 1, 13.9; subject 2, 7.8), clearly below the 5th\npercentile of a normal reference population (Fig. 2).\nAlso CYP2C19 activity was similarly low in both\nsubjects (plasma omeprazole\/5-hydroxyomeprazole 4 hpost dose; subject 1, 2.79; subject 2, 2.66), albeit still\nwithin the lowest quartile of the normal reference range\n(Fig. 2). However, with regards to CYP2D6 and\nCYP3A4, we observed lower metabolic capacities for\nsubject 1 who was homozygous for POR A287P than for\nsubject 2 who carried only one mutant POR A287P\nallele. Subject 1 showed clearly subnormal conversion\nof the probe drugs, whereas observed metabolic\ncapacities of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 for subject 2 still\nvaried within the lowest normal range (CYP2D6:\nplasma dextromethorphan\/dextrorphan 3 h post dose;\nsubject 1, 5.05; subject 2, 0.68; CYP3A4: oral\nmidazolam clearance (L\/hl); subject 1, 10.7; subject 2,\n39.7) (Fig. 2).Discussion\nHere, we have provided in vivo evidence for impaired\ndrug metabolism as a consequence of mutant POR.\nIn vivo cocktail phenotyping revealed grossly diminished\nactivities of drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes in the two\nsubjects carrying the POR A287P mutation, a disease-\ncausing POR variant most frequently found in Cauca-\nsians (1, 2).

Of note, the clinically observed drug-\nmetabolizing CYP enzyme activities in the two subjects\nwere severely decreased despite CYP genotyping results\npredictive of normal to high activities. This suggests that\nthe effect of genetic variation in POR on interindividual\nvariability in drug metabolism may be at least as\nimportant as that of variant CYP alleles.\nWe have previously shown that POR A287P\ndifferentially affects the activity of electron-accepting\nsteroidogenic CYP enzymes, namely a preferential\ninhibition of 17-hydroxylase over 21-hydroxylase, as\ndemonstrated in vitro and also in vivo by increased\nurinary excretion of corticosterone over cortisol metab-\nolites, causing a relative accumulation of steroids with\nmineralocorticoid-like activity (24). The clinical signi-\nficance of this finding is clearly reflected by the clinical\nphenotype of the current patient who presented with\nmanifest arterial hypertension at the age of 24 years,\nmost likely a consequence of mild mineralocorticoid\nexcess. In addition, it has been shown that POR A287P\ndoes not result in any inhibition of CYP19A1 activity\n(25), further highlighting the differential effects of this\nmutant. Thus, it is entirely possible that distinct POR\nvariants may have only modest effects on steroidogenic\nCYP enzymes but could severely disrupt drug-metaboliz-\ning CYP enzymes.\nPOR is a highly polymorphic gene with more than\n140 documented sequence variants in the POR-coding\nregion, including 40 present on more than 1% of alleles\n(26). A number of in vitro studies and a recent in vivo\nstudy have attempted to address the correlation between\ngenetic variation in POR and drug-metabolizing CYPwww.eje-online.orgenzyme activities (10\u201314, 27). A recent study demon-\nstrated reduced in vitro CYP3A4 activity due to POR\nA287P (13). However, another study demonstrated\ncomplete abolishment of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19\nactivities by POR A287P in vitro (10), which contrasts\nwith our in vivo finding of clearly diminished albeit still\ndetectable CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 activities in our\npatient carrying homozygous A287P. This emphasizes\nthat in vitro assays are valuable, but will not always\ncorrectly reflect complex systems such as the CYP\u2013POR\ndrug-metabolizing complex, where genetic variants\nwithin more than one gene may impact on the\nenzymatic activities observed in vivo. Obviously, we\ncannot exclude that the observed reduction in drug-\nmetabolizing enzyme activities in our two subjects of\nsimilar familial genetic background could be due to\nanother, hitherto not yet identified genetic variation.\nHowever, the significance of POR for drug metabolism\nwas also indicated by previous rodent-based studies\nanalysing liver-specific Por deletion, demonstrating\ndisruption of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism (28)\nand reduced activation of the chemotherapeutic pro-\ndrug cyclophosphamide (29). Another possible caveat is\nthat the heterozygous mother was 78 years of age, and\nthe drug metabolism profile was compared with CYP\ngenotype-matched controls but could not be directly\ncompared with age-matched controls as such data are\nnot available. However, there is no general loss of hepatic\nCYP activity with age, as previously shown in vitro (30)\nand in vivo (31), which would explain the uniform low\nactivity in the mother.\nOf note, our patient developed breast cancer at the\nvery early age of 37 years, despite a negative family\nhistory. It is tempting to speculate about the possible\ncontribution of mutant POR to the development of this\nearly onset breast cancer. CYP3A4 is the major enzyme\ninvolved in the inactivation of steroid hormones\nincluding glucocorticoids and sex steroids (9), and we\nfound that in vivo CYP3A4 activity was grossly reduced\nin our patient, who had received standard dose\noestrogen replacement for 20 years prior to being\ndiagnosed with breast cancer. Impairment of CYP3A4\nactivity, as documented in our patient, will have\nundoubtedly resulted in delayed breakdown of and\nincreased exposure to oestrogen, a well-known risk\nfactor for breast cancer. CYP3A4 activity is known to\ndisplay broad interindividual variability and, in contrast\nto other drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes, convincing\nassociations between variant CYP3A4 alleles and\nobserved in vivo enzymatic activity are lacking (32).\nThus, variant POR might be a more important\nmodulator of CYP3A4 function than genetic variation\nin CYP3A4 itself.\nOur finding of grossly impaired drug-metabolizing\nactivities in our patient despite carrying variant CYP\nalleles predictive of high enzymatic activities inevitably\nposes the question whether this should alter clinical\nmanagement.
