Yet, for several decades, about a\nbillion people in developing countries have\nnot had a safe and sustainable water supply.\nIt has been estimated that a minimum of\n7.5 litres of water per person per day is\nrequired in the home for drinking, prepar-\ning food, and personal hygiene, the most\nbasic requirements for water; at least\n50 litres per person per day is needed to\nensure all personal hygiene, food hygiene,\ndomestic cleaning, and laundry needs [1].\nThis domestic water consumption is\ndwarfed by the demands of agriculture\nand ecosystems, even in wealthy countries\nwhere per capita domestic water consump-\ntion greatly exceeds these figures [2]. To\ncover all these requirements and to avoid\nwater stress, experts generally agree that\nabout 1,000 cubic metres of freshwater per\ncapita per year is needed [3].\nA key target of Millennium Development\nGoal (MDG) 7, which aims to ensure\nenvironmental sustainability, is \u2018\u2018to reduce\nby half the proportion of people without\nsustainable access to safe drinking water and\nbasic sanitation by 2015\u2019\u2019 [4]. This water\nsupply target underpins several other\nMDGs, including those relating to poverty\n(MDG1), education (MDG2), and gender\nequality (MDG3). In particular, it underpins\nMDG4, the reduction of child mortality,\nbecause many deaths in young children in\ndeveloping countries are due to diarrhoeal\ndisease, and unsafe water is a key risk factor\nfor diarrhoeal disease in this age group [5].\nThe WHO\/UNICEF Joint Monitoring\nProgramme for Water-supply and Sanita-\ntion (JMP), which monitors progress on\nthe MDG water supply target, identifies\nthree categories of drinking water supply:\n(a) water piped into the dwelling, plot, or\nyard; (b) other improved sources (including\npublic taps, protected springs, hand\npumps, and rainwater harvesting); and (c)\nunimproved sources (open water, unpro-\ntected from contamination) [6]. JMP as-\nsumes that \u2018\u2018improved\u2019\u2019 water should be\navailable not only for drinking but also for\nfood preparation and personal and home\nhygiene, but it provides no official defini-\ntion of how near a water source should\nbe to a dwelling to be called improved.\nHowever, a distance of,1,000 m has been\nsuggested as an appropriate distance for\nmeeting the MDG targets [7].\nIn poorly served countries, achieving the\nMDG water supply target will involve\nincreasing water availability for domestic\nuses, improving water quality, and bring-\ning about changed water-use and water-\nmanagement habits. In the wealthy coun-\ntries where adequate quantities of domestic\nwater are already available on demand, the\nmain task over the next few years will be to\nsustain water quality given the increasing\npressures of pollution. However, global\nwater supply targets need to be tempered\nby a recognition of the real demand (as\nexpressed in user willingness and ability to\npay), which may be less ambitious than the\ninternationally agreed target. Furthermore,\naccount needs to be taken of the realities\nof frequently poor levels of functionality.\nIt is relatively easy to increase coverage\nthrough construction of water supply\nsystems, but it is much more difficult to\nensure that such systems continue to\nprovide service over the long term.\nWe therefore argue in this paper for a\nserious commitment by national govern-\nments and their partners to ensure ade-\nquate water supply services for all (the\nMDG target, if met, would still leave 672\nmillion people with an unimproved supply\n[6,8]). In addition, we call for increased\nattention to be paid to ensuring continuing\nservice provision. This will mean finding\nnew ways to enhance public demand for\nimproved services (that might translate\ninto a willingness to pay), and a public and\nprivate sector ethos that puts high value on\nthe quality of construction and ongoing\nservice delivery.\nWater Supply and Health\nInadequacies in water supply affect\nhealth adversely both directly and indi-\nrectly (Box 1 and below). An inadequate\nwater supply also prevents good sanitation\nand hygiene. Consequently, improvements\nin various aspects of water supply repre-\nsent important opportunities to enhance\npublic health. Box 2 lists six attributes of\ndomestic water supply that determine\nwhether it is effective in the preservation\nof good health [14].\nThe Policy Forum allows health policy makers\naround the world to discuss challenges and\nopportunities for improving health care in their\nsocieties.\nCitation: Hunter PR, MacDonald AM, Carter RC (2010) Water Supply and Health.

This focus is not surprising given\nthat diarrhoeal disease is the second most\ncommon contributor to the disease burden\nin developing countries (as measured by\ndisability-adjusted life years [DALYs]),\nand poor-quality drinking water is an\nimportant risk factor for diarrhoea\n[18,19]. Most of the excess disease burden\nin developing countries falls on young\nchildren\u201417% of all deaths in children\nunder 5 years are attributed to diarrhoea\n[15]. Figures 1 and 2 illustrates how an\ninadequate water supply is a contributor to\ndeaths in children under 5 years [18,19]. It\nshows that both the gross domestic\nproduct per capita (GDP) [20] and the\nproportion of the population without\naccess to improved water are highly\ncorrelated with infant mortality (p,0.001\nfor both). Both measures remain indepen-\ndent risk factors for infant mortality in a\nmultiple predictor variable regression.\nWhile this analysis does not prove a direct\ncausal relationship, since access to im-\nproved water services is likely to be\naccompanied by improvements in other\nservices (such as sanitation), it is clear that\na broad statistical relationship exists be-\ntween improved water services and lower\ninfant mortality for countries of similar\nGDP.\nThe focus on acute diarrhoea, however,\nalmost certainly underestimates the disease\nburden caused by inadequate water and\nsanitation. There is a strong link between\nrepeat or chronic diarrhoeal disease,\nmalnutrition, and the poor educational\nand physical growth that can seriously\naffect the ability of children to reach their\nfull potential [21]. It has been suggested\nthat if the impacts of these chronic effects\nare taken into consideration, the real\nglobal disease burden due to diarrhoea\n(and, consequently, the health benefits of\nwater and sanitation interventions) would\nbe about twice the current estimates,\nwhich are based only on acute illness and\nmortality [21].\nThe evidence that improving access to\nsafe drinking water reduces the risk of\ndiarrhoeal disease in children is strong.\nHowever, since the early 1980s and\nespecially since Esrey\u2019s work in the late\n1980s [22], there has been a heated debate\nover the relative importance of water\nquantity and water quality in reducing\nthe incidence of diarrhoeal disease. The\nrather differing analyses of Esrey and\nsubsequent workers have led to different\nemphases in water supply interventions\u2014\nespecially in regard to the role of point-of-\nuse household water treatment technolo-\ngies (see Text S1).\nImportantly, however, whatever inter-\nvention is introduced, recent evidence\nsuggests that even occasional short-term\nfailures in water supply or water treatment\ncan seriously undermine many of the\npublic health benefits associated with an\nimproved water supply [23]. This evidence\nis not an argument against attempting to\nimprove water quality, whether through\ncommunity or household water treatment\ntechnologies, but it draws attention to the\nvital importance of developing systems\nthat will continue to deliver safe water in\nthe long term.\nDrinking Water and Nondiarrhoeal\nDisease\nInadequate access to safe drinking water\nis also associated with several nondiar-\nrhoeal diseases [24]. Chronic or acute\nexposure to many organic and inorganic\nSummary Points\nN A safe, reliable, affordable, and easily accessible water supply is essential for\ngood health, but for several decades almost 1 billion people in developing\ncountries have lacked access to such a supply.\nN A poor water supply impacts health by causing acute infectious diarrhoea,\nrepeat or chronic diarrhoea episodes, and nondiarrhoeal disease, which can\narise from chemical species such as arsenic and fluoride. It can also affect health\nby limiting productivity and the maintenance of personal hygiene.\nN Reasons for the limited progress towards universal access to an adequate water\nsupply include high population growth rates in developing countries,\ninsufficient rates of capital investment, difficulties in appropriately developing\nlocal water resources, and the ineffectiveness of institutions mandated to\nmanage water supplies (in urban areas) or to support community management\n(in rural areas).\nN Strenuous efforts must be made to improve access to safe and sustainable\nwater supplies in developing countries, and, given the health burden on the\npublic and the costs to the health system, health professionals should join with\nothers in demanding accelerated progress towards global access to safe water.\nBox 1. The Classification of Water-Related Disease\nThe standard classification of water-related disease was first proposed by David\nBradley [9] (Table 2). Although there have been suggested improvements since\n[10], none have gained as much recognition as the original system, probably\nbecause they are less focused on disease transmission mechanisms.\nAlthough this four-part classification has served a useful role in highlighting some\nof the public health impacts of inadequate water systems, it has also directed\nattention away from some other important health issues, namely:\nN There is no room in the classification for chemical-mediated diseases such as\narsenic and fluoride poisoning, which have major impacts in certain localities\n[11,12].\nN The classification takes no account of the impact on health of the need to\ncollect and transport water for many of the world\u2019s population. For example,\nmany children and women in developing countries have to carry heavy\ncontainers of water long distances each day, and there have been no systematic\nstudies about the impact this has on musculoskeletal health.\nN The long walks needed to collect water may also increase the spread of certain\ninfectious diseases though a community. For example, an epidemic of\nmeningococcal disease in a Sudanese refugee camp seemed to spread along\nthe routes that people take to collect their water [13].\nN Unpleasant tastes or odours (for example, arising from iron content of\ngroundwater, or associated with chlorination) in water supplies that are\nmicrobiologically safe may act as a deterrent to use of safe sources, so exposing\nusers to health risks associated with unprotected water sources.\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 2 November 2010 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e1000361\nchemical agents has been implicated in\nadverse health effects that range from\nacute nausea and vomiting or skin rashes,\nto cancer and foetal abnormalities [24].\nInorganic pollutants in drinking water that\nhave been linked with disease include\narsenic, copper, fluoride, lead, and nitrate.\nOrganic compounds that have caused\nconcern include pesticides, chlordane,\nphenol, and trihalomethanes [24]. More\nrecently, endocrine-disrupting compounds\nand pharmaceuticals in drinking water\nhave been causing concern [25].\nIn the developing world, one of the\nmost dramatic demonstrations of the link\nbetween drinking water and nondiarrhoeal\ndisease is the arsenic crisis in Bangladesh\n[26]. Arsenic in drinking water can have\nsubstantial adverse effects on health,\nincluding skin cancer and gangrene [27].\nThe Bangladesh crisis occurred because\nboreholes constructed to provide people\nwith clean drinking water often provided\nwater with naturally high arsenic concen-\ntrations. Fluoride in drinking water is also\ncausing increasing concern in the devel-\noping world. About 200 million people are\nat risk of exposure to elevated concentra-\ntions of fluoride in drinking water, which\ncan lead to dental and sometimes skeletal\nfluorosis [12,28]. Although the global\ndisease burden estimates for nondiarrhoeal\ndiseases associated with water supply\nproblems such as these fall far below\nsimilar estimates for diarrhoeal disease\n[29,30], the communities actually affected\nby these diseases can suffer severely.\nIndirect Links between Water and\nHealth\nIn addition to the direct health benefits\nof improved safe water supplies, there are\nmany indirect benefits. For example, the\nstrong relationship between water and\nlivelihoods in all regions and economies\nof the world affects health indirectly. In\ndeveloping countries, deficiencies in water\nsupply, whether for productive or domes-\ntic uses, have direct negative impacts on\nlivelihoods; in wealthier countries, past\ninvestment in water infrastructure and the\nability to invest more in the present\nincrease water security and, arguably,\nprosperity [31].\nLack of water can also lead indirectly to\ndisease via malnutrition. Several authors\nargue strongly for investments in low-cost\nwater harvesting techniques, irrigation,\nand clean water provision as a means of\nincreasing food production and reducing\ninfectious disease burden [32,33]. Numer-\nous examples exist across sub-Saharan\nAfrica and south Asia in which access to\na small amount of irrigated land has\ntransformed food security for highly vul-\nnerable households [34]. A study of child\nnutrition in otherwise comparable com-\nmunities with and without access to\nirrigation in central Kenya found clear\nevidence that irrigation contributed to\nhigher energy intakes and reduced chronic\nmalnutrition in children [35]. However,\nmixed conclusions were found in a study\ncomparing households close to and distant\nfrom two dams in Burkina Faso [36].\nFinally, improvements in water supply\nare essential prerequisites for improved\npersonal and home hygiene and to enable\nsanitation facilities to be kept clean.\nConsequently, the direct health effect of\nimproved water supply is likely to be\nextended by its indirect effects on sanita-\ntion and hygiene.\nEconomic Returns\nA recent study of the economic returns\non investments in water supply and\nsanitation indicated that every US$1 spent\non water supply and sanitation services\ncould lead to an economic return of\nbetween $5 and $46, with the highest\nreturns in the least-developed areas [16].\nMuch of this additional income was from\nBox 2. Six Factors That Determine Whether a Water Supply Can\nMaintain Good Health Effectively\nThe quality of the water relates to pathogens and chemical constituents in water\nthat can give rise to both diarrhoeal and nondiarrhoeal disease.\nThe quantity of water available and used. This is largely determined by (a) the\ndistance of carry involved, where water has to be transported (often on the heads\nor backs of children and women), and (b) the wealth of the user.\nAccess to water may be primarily a matter of physical distance or climb, but it may\nhave socioeconomic and\/or cultural dimensions if certain social groups are\ndenied access to particular water sources through cost or culture (see Figure 4).\nThe reliability of both unimproved and improved water supplies. Many cities in\nAsia, for example, supply piped water for only a few hours per day, or for a few\ndays in every week and many unimproved rural water supplies dry up regularly.\nThe cost of water to the user. This is represented by the cash tariff that is paid to a\nutility or provider or, in the case of unimproved water supplies, by the time and\nhealth penalty paid by the user.\nThe ease of management for the end user. In urban utility-managed supplies the\nuser merely pays a tariff; in rural settings in developing countries, users are\nexpected to play a major part in operation, maintenance, and management.\nFigure 1. Global association between national access to improved water source, GDP\nand infant mortality. Data sources [6,20,66].\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.1000361.g001\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 3 November 2010 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e1000361\nthe time saved by having reliable water\nclose to the household. Other studies also\nsuggest that investments in water alleviate\npoverty [37,38]. The balance of evidence\nfavours the likelihood that water and\nsanitation interventions have economic\nbenefits beyond those that simply relate\nto reduced health care costs. Indeed, it has\nbeen argued that adequate water and\nsanitation is an essential prerequisite to\neconomic development. Thus, poor coun-\ntries with access to improved water\nexperienced average annual growth of\n3.7% whereas countries with the same\nper capita income but without such access\nhave an annual growth of only 0.1% [39].\nStatus and Trends\nNowadays, many more people have an\nimproved water supply, as defined by JMP\n[6], than in the late 1970s. However, this\nincreased coverage has only just matched\nglobal population growth. The absolute\nnumber of people lacking access to an\nimproved water supply has hovered around\n1 billion since the late 1970s [6,40].\nUnfortunately, it is probable that the\npopulations remaining to be adequately\nserved (for example, in remote rural areas\nof low-income countries and in the peri-\nurban slums of the world\u2019s towns and cities)\nrepresent the most intractable problems.\nThe 1990 (base year for the MDGs) and\n2008 (most recent) statistics on urban\nwater supply show coverage rising from\n95% to 96%, while the total urban\npopulation has grown over this period\nfrom 2.3 billion to 3.4 billion. In rural\nareas, the coverage estimates are 64% and\n78% for 1990 and 2008, respectively,\nwhile the total rural population has grown\nfrom 3.0 billion to 3.4 billion (Table 1).\nOverall, 84% of people still not enjoying\nan improved water supply live in rural\nareas, but it is the urban areas that are\nstruggling most to keep ahead of popula-\ntion growth rates, which are commonly\ndouble the national averages.\nWith 2015 (the MDG target year) fast\napproaching, there is a heavy emphasis\ninternationally on accelerating progress\ntowards the coverage target. Nevertheless,\nthis push needs to be tempered with\nrealism and an emphasis on maintaining\nexisting water supplies in a functional\nstate. No-one wishes to see developing\ncountries littered with defunct water\nsupply systems as a legacy of the MDGs.\nDelivering a Better Water Supply\nIn wealthy nations, high-quality water is\nuniversally available with large amounts of\nmoney being spent to assure reliable\nhousehold supplies. In poorer countries,\nimproved access to water is generally\ndelivered through communally managed\npublic water points in rural areas and\nunreliable distribution systems in towns\nand cities. Unfortunately, many water\nsupply interventions in developing coun-\ntries do not last [41]. In a recent study of\n15 villages in South Africa with supposedly\nimproved water supplies, three villages\nhad insufficient water because their wells\nhad dried up or were incapable of meeting\nthe demand [42]. Five more villages had\nno water on the day of inspection\u2014two\nbecause their water pump had broken, two\nbecause there was no money to buy diesel\nfor the pump, and one because the pump\noperator was ill. This example illustrates\nsome of the challenges associated with\nkeeping water supply systems working over\nthe long term. Similarly, a study of water\nsupplies and arsenic mitigation technolo-\ngies in Bangladesh found that only about\n64% of the interventions were operational\n[43]; other studies suggest that across sub-\nSaharan Africa about one third of hand\npumps are nonfunctioning [44].\nUnfortunately, in low-income countries,\nrevenues recovered from the users of\nimproved water supplies are frequently\ninsufficient to meet the real running costs\nof both rural and urban water supplies, so\nsystems either deteriorate or need to be\nheavily subsidized. It is important that user\ntariffs are affordable, but that promising\napproaches for improving revenue gener-\nation include finding ways to reduce or\nspread the costs of establishing house\nconnections (in the case of urban piped\nsupplies), developing microfinance instru-\nments for rural user fees, and encouraging\nself-help and small enterprise-driven ap-\nproaches. Nevertheless, there needs to be\nrecognition that the true demand for\nimproved services (expressed as willingness\nto pay) may not yet match the level of\nservice being promoted through interna-\ntional targets such as those included in the\nMDGs.\nThere is increasing recognition of the\npart that self-help (self-supply) initiatives\nand small enterprises can play in delivering\nimproved and sustainable water services. A\nrecent review of water, sanitation, and\nhygiene for the Bill & Melinda Gates\nFoundation identified three broad ap-\nproaches to service provision: (a) externally\ndriven approaches (initiated by agencies\nother than the water users, and usually\nheavily subsidized); (b) self-supply initiatives\n(driven by user demand); and (c) enterprise-\ndriven approaches, in which local private\nentities supply goods and services to\ngovernments, nongovernmental organiza-\ntions (NGOs), and water users directly [45].\nThe last two, which could be combined,\nrepresent very different approaches from\nthe conventional, externally driven ap-\nproach. However, a heavy dependence on\n\u2018\u2018private\u2019\u2019 (mostly shallow groundwater)\nsources, which may be poorly constructed\nand vulnerable to contamination or failure\nduring dry periods, has important health\nimplications [46].\nOver the last decade, debates about\nprivate sector participation and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships for the improvement\nof water supply services have generated\nmore heat than light. There is little doubt\nFigure 2. Association between national access to improved water source, GDP and\ninfant mortality for Africa. Data sources [6,20,66].\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.1000361.g002\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 4 November 2010 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e1000361\nnow that the private sector is unlikely to\ninvest significant sums to modernize or\nextend water supply systems. However,\nthis sector has always had an important\nrole in the supply of goods and services,\nand in consultancy, supervision, and\ncapacity-building. These roles are unlikely\nto disappear and we therefore take a\npragmatic attitude to the involvement of\nthe private sector: local context determines\nwhat arrangements work best [47].\nIn recent years, WHO has promoted the\nidea of Water Safety Plans (WSPs) [48]. A\nWSP is a risk-based approach to public\nhealth achieved through water quality and\ncatchment management strategies under\nthe slogan \u2018\u2018managing drinking water\nquality from catchment to consumer.\u2019\u2019\nAlthough the WSP approach is widely\nutilised in urban piped supply systems,\nthere have been few attempts to implement\nthe approach in rural settings, where\ndistant water sources are the norm\n[49,50].\nConstraints and Challenges\nWhy the Slow Progress?\nSlow progress toward full water supply\ncoverage at a national level [6] may be\nrelated to national GDP [20], government\neffectiveness [51], or shortages of water\n[52]. We have explored the relationship\nbetween these three variables and coverage\nTable 1.

Its significance more locally is consid-\nered below. However, the proportion of\npeople with access to safe water was\ncorrelated with GDP (p,0.001) and gov-\nernment effectiveness (p,0.001). In a\nmultivariate model, GDP remained the\nonly significant independent covariate.\nClearly, therefore, a low GDP is a major\nchallenge facing efforts to improve water\nsupplies. Below we discuss some of the\nother reasons for slow progress.\nGovernment Effectiveness\nGovernment effectiveness in low-in-\ncome countries is often poor, and govern-\nments often lack capacity or show institu-\ntional weaknesses [53]. Such weaknesses\nrange from lack of individual professional\nskills, understaffing, poor motivation, in-\nadequate resources, and poor organisa-\ntional management, through to inappro-\npriate policies handed down to local\ngovernment from central authorities. In\naddition, corruption has been highlighted\nas a major threat to service delivery [39].\nLimited effectiveness of the Ministries\nand local government authorities responsi-\nble for water supply can be exacerbated by\ninsufficient political commitment at the\nhighest governmental levels and by the\nweaknesses of private companies contract-\ned to carry out construction or system\nmanagement. Furthermore, the profession-\nal and technical staff of central government\nand local authorities often find their own\nhigh levels of commitment constrained by\nthe systems within which they work.\nDissociation of the Health and Water\nSectors\nIn industrialised countries, much of the\nearly drive to provide water and sanitation\ncame from the medical community\n[54,55]. These days, the responsibility for\nthe management of these services usually\nrests with engineers and others not for-\nmally part of the public health system.\nThis dissociation of responsibility for water\nservices from generic public health has led\nto problems. For example, although ben-\nefits are usually \u2018\u2018accrued\u2019\u2019 by the health\nservice, the costs of water infrastructure\nand maintenance are borne by water\nutilities or boards, making expenditure\ndecisions difficult [56]. Nevertheless, the\npublic health community in general and\nthe public health consultant in particular\nmust be intimately involved in the provi-\nsion of water services, playing such\nimportant roles as setting the health-based\ntargets of WSPs [57] and designing and\nmanaging surveillance systems for water-\nborne disease [58].\nThe Walkerton tragedy\u2014a fatal water-\nborne disease epidemic in Ontario, Canada\nthat occurred in 2000\u2014provides a good\nexample of what can go wrong if public\nhealth oversight is completely removed\nfrom water providers [59]. One of the\nunderlying problems in this outbreak was\nthat the plant operators did not understand\nthe importance and significance of water\nquality monitoring, so did not monitor\nadequately nor report problems when they\noccurred. These lapses led to seven deaths\nand an estimated 2,000+ illnesses.\nThe Availability of Water Resources\nSustainable domestic water supplies\ndepend on the availability of reliable water\nresources that can be easily developed.\nFresh water resources are not spread\nevenly across the globe (Figure 3). Most\nof the wealthier areas of the world\nexperience sufficiently frequent rainfall to\nreplenish rivers, reservoirs, and aquifers\nreliably, and have the capacity to store and\ntransfer that water [31]. Nevertheless,\neven wealthy countries are not free from\nthe problems of occasional droughts, as\nrecently seen in Spain and Australia.\nIn many parts of Africa and Asia, the\nlong dry season and dispersed nature of\nmany of the populations who currently\nhave no reliable water supply mean that\nthe development of groundwater (a natu-\nral reservoir) is the only realistic option for\nsignificantly improving drinking water\ncoverage [60]. Consequently, statistics on\nnational water resources are not a good\nTable 2.

The important factor is\nthe availability of water resources (usually\ngroundwater) close to the point of need.\nGroundwater is not a panacea, however,\nand its development and use need careful\nattention. First, in some locations even\nsmall-scale groundwater supplies can be\ndifficult to find and develop [61]. Such\nlocations are often a priority for water\nsupply intervention since they are beset\nwith diseases related to high dependence\non contaminated surface water sources. A\nlack of appreciation of the variability in\nthe nature and occurrence of water\nresources is a major reason for expensive\nand unreliable supplies [62].\nSecond, groundwater resources rely on\nrainfall for renewal and are strongly\naffected by climate variability and climate\nchange [63]. Overabstraction of water,\nwhich can lead to falling water levels and\nthe exhaustion of resources, is a growing\nglobal problem, exacerbated by climate\nchange, population growth, and urbanisa-\ntion (see Text S2) [64].\nFinally, ground water sources across the\nglobe are increasingly being polluted\nthrough intensive agriculture, industry,\nand poor sanitation [64]. For wealthy\ncountries, this increases the costs of\nproviding access to safe water, because\nmore extensive water treatment is re-\nquired. In poor countries, expensive water\ntreatment is not affordable and there is\nlittle option but to drink increasingly\ncontaminated water.\nManagement of Water Supply\nTechnology\nOne of the myths of community water\nsupply in rural areas of low-income\ncountries is that users benefiting from\naccess to modern technology will, after a\nshort period of training, manage the\nsystem themselves. The reality is that years\nof external support may be needed to\nbuild the necessary capacity [41]. Without\nongoing external support (which is often\nabsent in the context of weak local\ngovernment), communities often fail to\neffectively manage modern technology for\nmore than a few years.\nEver since Schumacher\u2019s seminal work\npromoting the idea of \u2018\u2018intermediate\ntechnology,\u2019\u2019 individuals and organisations\nengaged in poverty alleviation have strug-\ngled to define what is now called \u2018\u2018appro-\npriate technology\u2019\u2019 [65]. The key is the\nmatch, or \u2018\u2018fit,\u2019\u2019 between the technology,\nthe users, and those who have to manage\nand maintain it. Whether we are dealing\nwith a rural water supply system managed\nmainly by the user community [60], or a\nmore technically sophisticated urban sup-\nply system (see Text S3), this fit is essential.\nModern technologies are only manageable\nif the right skills, resources, and incentives\nexist, and if appropriate support structures\nare provided.\nFinance\nThe level of water sector financing in\nlow-income countries is widely criticised as\nbeing inadequate, but at the same time\nwater supply budgets are often under-\nutilised or ineffectively used. Delays in the\nrelease of central government funds to\nlocal authorities combine with inadequate\nallocations for operational expenses to\nrender local governments ineffective in\ndisbursing the funds that do reach them.\nImportantly, though, the additional\nUS$11.3 billion that is needed annually\nto meet the water and sanitation MDG\ntargets\u2014a relatively small investment (a\nfew dollars per capita per year) that is\n\u2018\u2018highly feasible and within the reach of\nmost nations\u2019\u2019\u2014would yield an estimated\nseven-fold return [39].\nFigure 4. Although classified as an improved water supply, collecting water from a\ncommunity tap still requires considerable time and effort. (Photograph: Paul R. Hunter).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.1000361.g004\nPLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 7 November 2010 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e1000361\nImproved water supplies (in JMP ter-\nminology) usually attract a tariff or water\ncharge. In low-income countries it is\ncommon for such tariffs to be set at levels\nthat are below the real running costs. In\nsuch cases a vicious circle often becomes\nestablished, in which below-cost tariffs\nlead to inadequate investment in mainte-\nnance, which results in deteriorating\nservice and further unwillingness to pay\neven low tariffs.\nWater consumers without an improved\nwater supply do not pay a financial tariff\nfor water. Even though they may pay\nheavily in terms of health, time, and\nenergy, it often proves extremely difficult\nto change the mindset of consumers who\nare used to water being \u2018\u2018free.\u2019\u2019 Even small\nwater charges are not welcomed by\nconsumers, and revenue collections that\nstart as regular monthly charges often\ndeteriorate to ad hoc collections or\ndisappear altogether. Financial irregulari-\nties also often militate against continued\npayment of charges.\nStrategies to Achieve an Improved\nWater Supply\nAccess to a safe and continuous supply\nof water for drinking, cooking, and\npersonal hygiene is an essential prerequi-\nsite for health. An inadequate water\nsupply\u2014whether as a result of poor access\nor quality, low reliability, high cost, or\ndifficulty of management\u2014is associated\nwith significant health risks. These health\nrisks are experienced most strongly by the\npoorest nations, and the poorest house-\nholds within nations. A good water supply\nis necessary for good sanitation and\nhygiene, and to underpin livelihoods,\nnutrition, and economic growth.\nThe global MDG target on water\nsupply is likely to be met [6] but will leave\nmany hundreds of millions of people\nwithout an adequate water supply. Fur-\nthermore, the targets are highly unlikely to\nbe met in sub-Saharan Africa. Failure to\nextend water supply services at an ade-\nquate pace is largely a consequence of high\npopulation growth rates in the low-income\ncountries, insufficient investment (al-\nthough the sums needed are not large),\nand poor governance. Failure of existing\nwater supplies is often due to weak\nfinancial and management arrangements\nfor operation and maintenance, and a\nmismatch between the technology, the\nwater environment, and the capacity of\nusers to maintain systems. The result is\npoorly performing or broken down urban\nand rural water supply systems, and\ncontinuing poor health.\nWhile the health systems of developing\ncountries are not directly responsible for\nchanging this situation, poor water sup-\nplies place large burdens of disease on\ntheir populations, and it is those popula-\ntions and their national health services that\npick up the costs of diarrhoea and other\ndiseases. Health professionals should\ntherefore join those from other sectors\n(infrastructure, education, and economic\ndevelopment) in demanding change.\nHowever, it is clear that many uncer-\ntainties remain about how to improve\npublic health through improvements in\nthe water supply. Thus, more and better\nresearch is desperately needed, in partic-\nular larger and longer double-blinded\nrandomized controlled studies of the\nhealth impacts of water supply and quality\ninterventions at the community and\nhousehold level.\nBut it is equally clear that action must\nnot wait for the outcomes of such research.\nWe know enough now about the impor-\ntance of improved water supply, sanita-\ntion, and hygiene in relation to health to\nconsider universal access to these services\nto be an urgent imperative.\nSupporting Information\nText S1 Quantity versus quality and the\nrole of household water treatment.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.\n1000361.s001 (0.09 MB PDF)\nText S2 Climate change, drinking water,\nand health.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.\n1000361.s002 (0.07 MB PDF)\nText S3 The growing issue of urban\nwater supply.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.pmed.\n1000361.s003 (0.07 MB PDF)\nAuthor Contributions\nICMJE criteria for authorship read and met:\nPRH AMM RCC.
