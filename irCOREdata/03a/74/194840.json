Recently, however, observations\nwith XMM\u2013Newton and Chandra have revolutionized our under-\nstanding of heavily obscured AGN [for a complete description of\nXMM\u2013Newton, Chandra and their relative capabilities, see Jansen\net al. (2001) and Weisskopf et al. (2002) and references therein]. The\ncombination of the high spatial resolution afforded by Chandra, the\nlarge collecting area of XMM\u2013Newton and the high spectral resolu-\ntion X-ray spectroscopy capabilities (in the form of X-ray grating\nand CCD instruments) of both missions across the 0.1\u201312 keV band\n\u0002E-mail: schurch@andrew.cmu.edu\nis beginning to reveal many new details of the X-ray emission from\nheavily obscured AGN, particularly with regard to the soft X-ray\nemission from these objects. Chandra observations of several heav-\nily obscured AGN have revealed considerable extended soft X-ray\nemission in each source, which is tightly correlated with the [O\nIII] (\u03bb5007) emission observed with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST; NGC 1068, Young, Wilson & Shopbell 2001; Mrk 3, Sako\net al. 2000; NGC 4151, Ogle et al. 2000; Circinus, Sambruna et al.\n2001). In several of these sources (e.g. NGC 1068, Young et al.\n2001), the extended X-ray emission and the [O III] (\u03bb5007) emis-\nsion clearly trace the spiral arms and other large-scale structures\nout to a considerable distance from the active nucleus of the galaxy.\nSimilarly, recent spectral observations of these AGN with the X-\nray grating instruments on board Chandra (NGC 1068, Brinkman\net al. 2002; Ogle et al. 2003; Mrk 3, Sako et al. 2000; NGC 4151,\nOgle et al. 2000; Circinus, Sambruna et al. 2001) and XMM\u2013Newton\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n2 N. J. Schurch et al.\n(Kinkhabwala et al. 2002) have revealed soft X-ray spectra domi-\nnated by prominent emission lines from a range of light elements\n(e.g. C, N, O, Ne, etc.). These observations constitute a growing\nbody of evidence that suggests that the soft X-ray emission from\nheavily obscured Seyfert galaxies is largely composed of soft X-\nray emission lines that originate in gas that is photoionized (and\nphotoexcited) by the central AGN.\nThe type 1.5 Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 was identified as an X-ray\nsource over 30 years ago (Gursky et al. 1971). One of the brightest\nAGN accessible in the X-ray band, NGC 4151 has been extensively\nstudied by missions such as EXOSAT , Ginga, ROSAT , ASCA, CGRO\nand more recently RXTE, BeppoSAX, Chandra and XMM\u2013Newton.\nThis observational focus has revealed that the spectrum of NGC\n4151 from 0.1 to 100 keV comprises a complex mixture of emis-\nsion and absorption components, probably originating in a variety\nof locations from the innermost parts of the putative accretion disc\nin NGC 4151, out to the extended narrow-line region (ENLR) of the\ngalaxy. Despite the relatively poor quality of the spectra, previous\nobservations (particularly observations with ASCA) did tentatively\nreveal several unresolved soft X-ray features, suggesting that the soft\nX-ray emission was somewhat more complex than had been previ-\nously suggested. The most prominent feature found with ASCA was\nat an energy of \u223c0.88 keV and was tentatively associated with O VIII\nLy\u03b1 radiative recombination continua (RRC) (Weaver et al. 1994;\nGriffiths et al. 1998). The detailed nature of the soft X-ray emission\nin NGC 4151 has only recently been revealed through a Chandra\nHETG observation (Ogle et al. 2000; Yang, Wilson & Ferruit 2001).\nThis observation demonstrated that the soft X-ray spectrum was\ncomposed almost entirely of emission lines and RRC, with little or\nno detected continuum emission of any form (and hence no absorp-\ntion features). Utilizing the excellent spatial resolution of Chandra,\nOgle et al. (2000) resolved \u223c70 per cent of the soft X-ray emission\nas extended emission, originating up to 11.5 arcsec from the AGN,\nwhich demonstrated an excellent correspondence with the biconi-\ncal [O III] (\u03bb5007) emission previously imaged with the HST (Evans\net al. 1993). The Chandra observation was even capable of resolving\nthe spatial profiles of several of the brightest emission lines (includ-\ning the iron K\u03b1 emission line), showing that the individual line\nemission was genuinely extended along the direction of the optical\nionization cones. The Chandra observation dramatically confirmed\nthat the hard X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 is strongly cut off below\n2 keV and that the soft excess is not predominantly produced by\nelectron scattering of the hard X-ray continuum. The Chandra anal-\nysis finds evidence for both photoionized and collisionally ionized\n(thermal) gas in the ENLR. However, many of the details of the\nionized medium remained elusive, as a result of the large number\n(33 in total) and low significance of the features detected.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the XMM\u2013\nNewton observations of NGC 4151. Section 3 presents the XMM\u2013\nNewton RGS spectra and discusses the spectral modelling in terms\nof emission from an ionization cone. Section 4 compares the RGS\nspectra of NGC 4151 with the soft X-ray spectra of NGC 1068 and\nMrk 3. Section 5 presents a preliminary look at the correspondence\nbetween the XMM\u2013Newton RGS and the XMM\u2013Newton EPIC soft\nX-ray spectra of NGC 4151.\n2 T H E X M M \u2013 N E W TO N O B S E RVAT I O N S\nNGC 4151 was observed with XMM\u2013Newton five times during 2000\nDecember 21\u201323. The RGS instruments were active for all five\nobservations and the data were processed with the standard RGS\npipeline processing chains incorporated in the XMM\u2013Newton SAS\nv5.4.1. Dispersed source spectra and background spectra were ex-\ntracted with the automated RGS extraction tasks in the SAS. The\nSAS filters the RGS events in dispersion channel versus CCD pulse\nheight space to separate the data from the different spectral orders.\nInvestigation of the individual spectra indicate that the second-order\nRGS spectra contain a negligible amount of information (a count\nrate of \u000110 per cent of that in the first-order spectra, despite hav-\ning \u223c60 per cent of the effective area below 10 \u00c5) and as a result\nonly the first-order spectra are presented here. The resulting spec-\ntra have a total effective exposure time of \u223c128 ks and \u223c125 ks\nfor the RGS 1 and 2 instruments respectively. A previous inves-\ntigation of the XMM\u2013Newton EPIC spectra confirms that the soft\nX-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 remained relatively constant for the\nduration of the observation (Schurch et al. 2003). The spectra from\nthe five observations were co-added to produce a single high signal-\nto-noise ratio source spectrum and a single background spectrum\nfor each RGS instrument. The full spectra and individual lines were\nanalysed with both maximum-likelihood and \u03c72 minimization tech-\nniques. For the maximum-likelihood analysis the spectra were left\nunbinned; however, for the \u03c7 2 minimization techniques (which, in\ngeneral, are not particularly well suited to fitting the sharp features\nobserved in this and similar high-resolution soft X-ray spectra), the\nspectra were binned to a minimum of 20 counts per spectral channel.\nInvestigation of the spatial extent of the X-ray emission observed\nby XMM\u2013Newton reveals that the soft X-ray emission is not sig-\nnificantly extended on scales greater than the mirror point spread\nfunction (PSF), consistent with the details of the previously reported\nChandra observation of NGC 4151 (Ogle et al. 2000).\n3 M O D E L L I N G T H E R G S S P E C T R A\nFig. 1 shows the XMM\u2013Newton RGS spectra from the combined\nobservations of NGC 4151. The spectrum is completely dominated\nby line emission and RRC. Line emission is clearly detected from\nhydrogen-like and helium-like ionization states of neon, oxygen,\nnitrogen and carbon, and in many cases the line emission asso-\nciated with these ions is not limited to the Ly\u03b1 (2p\u20131s) transition\nbut includes higher-order resonance transitions (np\u20131s) labelled \u03b2\u2013\u03b5\nfor the different hydrogen-like and helium-like species respectively.\nMuch of the unidentified line emission below \u223c16 \u00c5 can be asso-\nciated with a multitude of unresolved iron L-shell emission lines,\nalong with some contribution from hydrogen-like and helium-like\nsilicon and magnesium. The spectra show no significant continuum\nemission and no fluorescent line emission. (There may be a marginal\ndetection of silicon K\u03b1 fluorescence at \u223c7.1 \u00c5. However, without\na good knowledge of the iron L-shell emission in this region, it is\nnot possible to measure the line cleanly.)\n3.1 The emission lines\nThe spectrum is remarkably similar to the soft X-ray spectrum of\nthe archetypal bright type 2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, reported by\nKinkhabwala et al. (2002). Both sources show strong emission-line\ntriplets from helium-like nitrogen and oxygen, with a similar pattern\nof resonance, intercombination and forbidden linestrengths. Follow-\ning the analysis of the XMM\u2013Newton RGS observation of NGC 1068\npresented in Kinkhabwala et al. (2002), line fluxes, centroid energies\nand linewidths were determined for the bright, unambiguously iden-\ntified, emission lines observed in the spectra. The spectral fits quoted\nhere for individual strong line features were performed with \u03c7 2 min-\nimization techniques (and correspondingly the data were binned to\na minimum of 20 counts per spectral channel).

RGS 1 (red) and RGS 2 (blue) spectra of NGC 4151. The spectra here are unbinned. Spectral discontinuities are caused by chip gaps in the CCD\narrays and the effects of the damaged RGS CCDs. Unambiguously identified hydrogen-like and helium-like emission lines are labelled along with the clearly\nidentified RRC.\nthe fit properties using maximum-likelihood fitting techniques for\nindividual lines reveals that the best-fitting parameters are not sig-\nnificantly different using these statistical techniques in comparison\nwith the \u03c72 fits, as expected given the bright nature of the features\nexamined here. The intrinsic profiles of the emission lines are repre-\nsented by a line model with a Gaussian profile (we caution, however,\nthat the original line profile may in fact not be Gaussian, although\nit does appear to be a good approximation for the lines presented\nhere), which allows the determination of accurate line centroid en-\nergies, fluxes and, in some cases, linewidths. The results of fitting\nthis profile to the brightest emission lines are given in Table 1.\nThe measured fluxes take account of the Galactic column density\n(2.1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122; Warwick, Done & Smith 1995) using the tbabs\nmodel in XSPEC, and the line shifts are measured with respect to the\nsource redshift of z = 0.00332. The systematic uncertainty on mea-\nsuring the centroid line energies of the lines is estimated to be \u223c8 \u00d7\n10\u22123 \u00c5 (which corresponds to about 150 km s\u22121; XMM Users Hand-\nbook v2.1, 2002). The quoted errors are 90 per cent confidence\nlevels as defined by a \b\u03c72 = 2.71 criterion (i.e. assuming one pa-\nrameter of interest) and include the systematic uncertainty added in\nquadrature. Most of the measured line centroid energies are con-\nsistent with a mild blueshift, of between \u223c100 and 1000 km s\u22121,\nwith respect to the systemic velocity of the lines. This implies a\nline-of-sight outflow velocity for the ionized material of\u00021000 km\ns\u22121, consistent with the line shifts of the absorption lines observed\nin the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of NGC 4151 (\u223c600 km s\u22121; Kriss\net al. 1995). Many of the observed linewidths are largely uncon-\nstrained, with the spectral fitting only yielding upper limits (these\nare not quoted in Table 1); however, the seven linewidths that are\nconstrained by the spectral fitting appear to show a bimodal distribu-\ntion, with the shorter-wavelength lines having an average linewidth\nof \u03c3 \u223c 0.025 \u00c5 (1000 km s\u22121 full width at half-maximum, FWHM)\nand the longer-wavelength lines having an average linewidth of\n\u223c0.005 \u00c5 (\u223c200 km s\u22121 FWHM). The observed linewidths im-\nply that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the outflowing material\nis \u00021000 km s\u22121, which is somewhat lower than the linewidths of\nthe absorption lines observed in the UV (1000\u20132500 km s\u22121; Kriss\net al. 1995). The bimodal distribution of the linewidths as a function\nof the wavelength of the line is suggestive of a scenario in which\nindividual clouds of emitting material close to the source of the ion-\nizing continuum are moving more rapidly than clouds further from\nthe continuum source. The large majority of the soft X-ray flux of\nNGC 4151 as measured by Chandra is not extended on scales larger\nthan \u223c2 arcsec, demonstrating that the reported extended soft X-ray\nflux will not contribute considerably to the linewidths measured in\nthe RGS spectrum.\n3.2 Temperature diagnostics with radiative recombination\ncontinua\nThe RRC identified in the RGS spectra are the result of a\nfree electron recombining directly into a bound state of an ion.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 350, 1\u20139\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n4 N.

The free electrons can have any energy above the recom-\nbination threshold and hence the feature produced is neither sym-\nmetrical nor narrow. The energy of the electrons prior to the re-\ncombination process is dependent upon the electron temperature\nof the emitting plasma, and hence the width of the RRC features\nprovides a direct measurement of the recombining electron temper-\nature, T e (Liedahl & Paerels 1996; Liedahl 1999). RRC originating\nin hot plasmas are broad and often subtle features; however, RRC\nfrom cool plasmas are narrow, prominent, features. The velocity\ndispersion of the emitting material will affect the RRC in exactly\nthe same manner as it affects the emission lines discussed previ-\nously, but this effect is negligible here because of the low velocities\nof the ions involved compared to that of the electrons. RRC from\nhydrogen-like and helium-like ionization states of Ne, O, N and C\nare clearly identifiable in Fig. 1. Electron temperatures were de-\ntermined for the bright, unambiguously identified, RRC (Table 2)\nusing the RRC profiles generated by the \u2018ionization cone\u2019 model\ndiscussed in Section 3.4 fitted, using \u03c72 minimization techniques,\nto the individual RRC. Again, an examination of the fit properties\nusing maximum-likelihood fitting techniques for individual features\nreveals that the best-fitting parameters are not significantly different\nusing these statistical techniques in comparison with the \u03c72 fits. The\nderived electron temperatures imply electron temperatures of \u223c(2\u2013\n4) \u00d7 104 K. The association of high-ionization emission lines (e.g.\nO VIII, Ne X, etc., identified in the previous section) with such a low-\ntemperature plasma is strongly indicative of a plasma whose ioniza-\ntion state is governed by photoionization as opposed to collisional\nionization.\nTable 2.

Ratios of the\nmeasured line fluxes for the recombination, intercombination and\nforbidden lines from helium-like ions provide a diagnostic of the\nelectron density and temperature in hot plasmas. Gabriel & Jordan\n(1969) were the first to recognize the importance of the helium-like\ntriplet lines and used linestrength ratios to analyse the solar corona\nspectra in detail. The ratio of the intensity of the forbidden line to the\nintensity of the intercombination line (R, where R = f \/i) is sensitive\nto the electron density of the plasma, and the ratio of the sum of\nthe intensities of the forbidden and intercombination lines to the\nintensity of the resonance line [G, where G = (i + f )\/r ] is sensitive\nto the electron temperature of the plasma. For a detailed discussion\nof the manner in which the ratios depend on the electron density\nand the plasma temperature, see Pradhan et al. (1981), Porquet &\nDubau (2000) and Porquet et al. (2002) and references therein.\nThe R and G ratios for the Ne, O and N triplets observed in the\nRGS spectrum of NGC 4151 are given in Table 3. The G-values\nimply an electron temperature of \u0002105 K, consistent with the elec-\ntron temperatures implied from the properties of the observed RRC\nand consistent with photoionization being the dominant ionization\nmechanism in the plasma (Porquet & Dubau 2000). The R-values\nimply electron densities of \u223c108\u2013109 cm\u22123 in nitrogen and oxy-\ngen and \u223c1010\u20131011 cm\u22123 in neon (Porquet & Dubau 2000). In\nparticular, the ratios calculated from the oxygen triplet (which is\nboth the strongest and the least confused of the helium-like triplets)\nstrongly imply a photoionized plasma. However, extracting detailed\nvalues of density and temperature for the emitting material is com-\nplicated by the possibility that a strong radiation field (i.e. photoex-\ncitation) can mimic the effect that a relatively high density has on\nthe linestrengths. In such a situation, the electron density and, to a\nlesser extent, the electron temperature can be overestimated (Porquet\net al. 2002). We note that the expected contribution of blended\ndielectronic satellite lines to these ratios has not been taken into\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 350, 1\u20139\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThe complex soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 5\nFigure 2. Schematic cartoon of the \u2018ionization cone\u2019 model (not to scale).\nThe central nuclear components (black hole and accretion disc), denoted by\nthe black spot, are surrounded by a dense absorbing torus of neutral dust and\ngas. The optically thin material perpendicular to the plane of the absorbing\ntorus sees the direct continuum from the X-ray source and becomes strongly\nionized, forming ionization cones. The line emission from these cones is\nobservable from type 2 Seyfert galaxies due to the suppression of the direct\ncontinuum, whereas the ionization cones in type 1 Seyfert galaxies are only\nseen through their absorption of the direct continuum (Kinkhabwala et al.\n2002).\naccount in the values quoted here. For the N and O triplets this\ncontribution is negligible; however, the Ne triplet is significantly\naffected. For a high-temperature, collisionally dominated plasma,\nthe additional contribution can result in an error of \u223c1 per cent and\n\u223c9 per cent for the R and G ratios, respectively. However, for a\nphotoionized plasma, where the temperatures are several orders of\nmagnitude lower, this effect can be considerably greater (Porquet\net al. 2002).\n3.4 The ionization cone model\nGiven the similarity between the RGS spectra of NGC 1068\nand 4151, we utilize the \u2018ionization cone\u2019 model developed by\nKinkhabwala et al. (2002) in their analysis of the RGS spectrum\nof NGC 1068, to fit the RGS spectrum of NGC 4151. This model,\nwhich was incorporated into XSPEC for ease of spectral fitting, re-\nproduces the hydrogen-like and helium-like line emission, and the\nassociated RRC, from an irradiated cone of optically thin plasma\n(cf. the ionization cones observed in [O III] by HST) shown schemat-\nically in Fig. 2. The model includes the effects of both photoioniza-\ntion and, crucially, photoexcitation. Photoexcitation is the process\nby which the absorption of a photon with insufficient energy to\nionize the atom results in the transition of an inner-shell electron\nto a higher energy level within the atom. The excited electron will\nrapidly undergo one or more radiative transitions, decaying back to\nits original energy state. For each atomic species, photoexcitation\nis expected to enhance the intensity of the higher-order resonance\ntransition lines relative to the first-order resonance line. Photoex-\ncitation was observed to play a significant role in the spectrum of\nNGC 1068, where the Ly\u03b2, Ly\u03b3 and Ly\u03b4 lines were significantly\nstronger than predicted by models based on pure photoionization or\ncollisional ionization.\nHere, as with NGC 1068, the plasma is irradiated by the unab-\nsorbed intrinsic power-law continuum, the slope of which in the\ncase of NGC 4151 is fixed at \u000f = 1.65, based on the analysis of\nthe hard X-ray XMM\u2013Newton EPIC spectrum presented in Schurch\net al. (2003). The luminosity of the central source, LX, and the\ncovering fraction of the cone, f , are fixed at L X = 6 \u00d7 1043 erg\ns\u22121 and f = 0.1, respectively. The modelling includes both Galac-\ntic column density (2.1 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122; Warwick et al. 1995) using\nthe tbabs model in XSPEC and a source redshift of z = 0.00332.\nThe electron temperatures for each atomic species were fixed at the\ntemperatures found from the analysis of the RRC (Table 2), where\npossible, and the remaining RRC temperatures were fixed at the\ntemperatures identified for NGC 1068 by Kinkhabwala et al. (2002)\n\u2013 based on the similarity between the observed bright RRC in NGC\n4151 and the corresponding RRC in NGC 1068. The remaining\nfree parameters of the model are the transverse velocity distribution\nof the lines, \u03c3 obsv , the radial velocity distribution of the lines, \u03c3 radv ,\nand the radial column density of each individual atomic species,\nNradion. The modelling presented in the next section includes a sig-\nnificant contribution from iron L-shell emission lines. Iron L-shell\nemission, known to be present in the soft X-ray spectrum of both\nMrk 3 and NGC 1068, will contribute significantly between \u223c9 and\n16 \u00c5 (0.75\u20131.4 keV) and will result in an artificially high measure\nof the ionic column densities of neon and magnesium if it is not\nincorporated in the modelling.\n3.5 Fitting the ionization cone model to the RGS spectra\nThe ionization cone model was fitted to the RGS spectra in XSPEC for\nsimplicity. We note that the \u03c7 2 minimization techniques, used earlier\nin the paper to fit specific bright spectral features, are, in general, not\nwell suited to fitting wide-band X-ray grating spectra, which often\nincorporate many additional low-significance spectral features. With\nthis in mind, the ionization cone model is fitted to the RGS spectra\nof NGC 4151 using maximum-likelihood fitting techniques. The\ncomplexity of this specific model makes the accurate determination\nof individual parameter errors problematic. Despite this caveat, the\nmodel provides a \u2018good fit\u2019 to all the hydrogen-like and helium-\nlike line emission and RRC observed in the RGS spectra. Here,\nthe term \u2018good fit\u2019 refers only to a set of parameters that correctly\nreproduces the distinct features observed in the spectrum (i.e. it\nis not a statistical measure of the goodness of fit of the model).\nBecause of this, statistical errors are not quoted for either the column\ndensities or the velocity measurements. Fig. 3 shows the best fit of\nthe ionization cone model to all the hydrogen-like and helium-like\nemission lines and RRC in the RGS spectrum of NGC 4151. The\nbest-fitting radial ionic column densities and the associated RRC\nelectron temperatures are given in Table 4; \u03c3 obsv has a best-fitting\nvalue of \u223c400 km s\u22121 and \u03c3 radv has a best-fitting value of \u223c330 km\ns\u22121.

Both sources show strong\nhydrogen-like and helium-like line emission and RRC from carbon,\nnitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium and silicon. The resemblance\nbetween the spectra is apparent in the details of the spectra as well\nas on a more general level. For example, both sources show similar\npatterns of resonance, intercombination and forbidden linestrengths\nfor the helium-like triplets of nitrogen and oxygen and both show\nsignificant (but unresolved) iron L-shell emission. The properties of\nthe detected emission lines are remarkably alike in the two sources,\nin terms of both the lines present and the scale of their energy shifts.\nIn both sources the prominent emission lines are blueshifted by\n<1000 km s\u22121 with average line shifts of 305 and 375 km s\u22121 for\nNGC 4151 and 1068, respectively (Kinkhabwala et al. 2002). The\nlinewidths measured for NGC 1068 do not show the bimodal distri-\nbution observed in NGC 4151. However, since only seven lines have\nconstrained linewidths in the NGC 4151 spectrum, compared to 23\nlines with constrained widths in the NGC 1068 spectrum, caution\nshould be strongly emphasized in interpreting the validity of the\ndistribution of linewidths in NGC 4151. Interestingly the average\nlinewidth found in the NGC 1068 data (\u223c1100 km s\u22121 FWHM) is\ncomparable to the average linewidth of the group of broader lines\nin the NGC 4151 spectrum (\u223c1000 km s\u22121 FWHM). It is tempting,\nbased upon a comparison of the helium-like triplet plasma diagnostic\nratios (R and G; Section 3.3) to infer that the ionization cones in NGC\n4151 have a somewhat lower electron temperature and a somewhat\nhigher electron density than those in NGC 1068 (Kinkhabwala et al.\n2002). Unfortunately, the situation may not be as clear cut as this\nsimple comparison suggests, primarily due to the unknown effect\nof photoexcitation on the diagnostic ratios (discussed previously in\nSection 3.3). The best-fitting ionic column densities for NGC 1068\nwere found to be similar to those observed in absorption for type 1\nSeyfert galaxies, implying either radially stratified ionization zones\nor, more likely, a broad distribution of densities at any given ra-\ndius. An inspection of the radial column densities fitted to the RGS\nspectrum reveals that NGC 4151 appears to have less ionized ma-\nterial in its ionization cones, by a factor of \u223c3.5 on average. The\nbest-fitting ionic electron temperatures, based on the widths of the\nRRC features, are also extremely similar between NGC 4151 and\n1068 (although the comparatively large errors on these temperatures\nprevents any definite conclusions being drawn regarding this simi-\nlarity). The ionic column densities are dependent on a combination\nof factors including cone length, density, ionization parameter and\nthe filling factor of the material. Lower ionic column densities could\nbe the result of lower ionizing flux or less material in the ioniza-\ntion cones. However, a somewhat more plausible explanation, in line\nwith the smaller R-values from the helium-like line triplets, could be\nthat the material in the ionization cones of NGC 4151 is rather more\ndense than the material in the ionization cones of NGC 1068. Since\nthe recombination rate is dependent on the density of the material,\nthis can result in a smaller ionized fraction for a similar ionizing\ncontinuum.\n4.2 The comparison with the Chandra HETG observation\nof Mrk 3\nThe Chandra HETG observation of Mrk 3 was the first published\nhigh-resolution soft X-ray spectrum of a type 2 Seyfert galaxy and\nshowed unambiguously that the soft X-ray emission in Mrk 3 is\ncomposed almost entirely of emission lines and RRC, with little or\nno continuum emission. The soft X-ray spectrum of Mrk 3 is, again,\nremarkably analogous to the soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151,\nthough with somewhat less statistical significance due to the rapidly\ndecreasing effective area of the HETG instrument at wavelengths\nabove \u223c9 \u00c5. In both sources there is strong evidence to suggest\nthat the observed emission lines are produced in a photoionized and\nphotoexcited plasma (Sako et al. 2000). The importance of photoex-\ncitation in the spectrum of Mrk 3 is highlighted by the observed weak\niron L-shell emission, rather than by the enhanced higher-order res-\nonance transitions, rejecting explanations from a recombination- or\ncollisionally dominated plasma. Despite this impressive spectrum,\nthe Chandra observation of Mrk 3 only partially resolves two of\nthe helium-like line triplets detected in the RGS spectrum of NGC\n4151 (oxygen and neon), because of the limited number of photons\nin each feature, and as a result many of the properties of the plasma\nare not well constrained. In particular, the resonance and intercom-\nbination lines of these triplets cannot be separated and as a result\nSako et al. (2000) quote a different diagnostic line ratio, i.e. (r +\ni)\/ f , from the line ratios used here.\nAt wavelengths shorter than \u223c9 \u00c5, the Chandra spectrum shows\nevidence for a reflection-dominated continuum along with clear de-\ntections of emission lines that are either extremely difficult or impos-\nsible to detect with the RGS (given its limited spectral bandpass),\nnamely Fe XXVI, Fe XXV, Fe K\u03b1, S xvi, S XV, S K\u03b1, Si XIV, Si\nXIII, Si K\u03b1, Mg XII and Mg XI (Sako et al. 2000). This plethora of\nlines highlights the complementary capabilities of XMM\u2013Newton\nand Chandra and strongly supports future observations of bright,\nheavily obscured AGN with both Chandra (using the HETG) and\nXMM\u2013Newton, to obtain the highest possible resolution X-ray spec-\ntra over the widest possible energy range. The line ratios calculated\nfrom the Chandra detections of the helium-like silicon and magne-\nsium line triplets (i.e. Si XIII and Mg XI) are all inconsistent with the\nexpected values for a collisionally ionized plasma and are marginally\nconsistent with the predictions from a photoionized plasma, similar\nto the conclusions from the triplet ratios for both NGC 4151 and\n1068.\n5 A B R I E F C O M PA R I S O N W I T H T H E\nX M M \u2013 N E W TO N E P I C S P E C T R A\nOne of the strengths of XMM\u2013Newton is that all the science instru-\nments operate simultaneously during each observation, allowing\na direct comparison between the high-resolution spectra from the\nRGS instruments and the lower-resolution spectra from the EPIC\nCCD detectors. This comparison is particularly useful in exposing\nfeatures in each source spectrum that the other detectors struggle\nto detect. For example, broad features present in the 0.3\u20132.5 keV\nrange are not easily identified in RGS spectra, but will be more\nclearly observed by the EPIC instruments. Conversely, features that\nappear to be broad in the EPIC spectrum may be resolved into a\nset of individual narrow lines by the RGS instruments. Conclusions\nfrom the process of comparing the EPIC and RGS spectra are com-\nplicated by the need for good calibration and cross-calibration for\neach instrument involved.\nFig. 4 shows the full-window mode EPIC PN spectra fitted with a\nmodel that combines the best fit of the hard X-ray model developed\nin Schurch et al. (2003) and the best fit of the \u2018ionization cone\u2019 soft\nX-ray model presented in Section 3.4. In addition to the hard X-ray\nmodel and the ionization cone model, a silicon K\u03b1 line was included\nin the fitting. The energy of the line was fixed at 1.73 keV and the\nlinewidth was fixed to be the same width as the iron K\u03b1 linewidth.\nThe line flux was fixed to be 5 per cent of the flux contained in the\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 350, 1\u20139\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n8 N.

Initially the column densities of the hydrogen- and helium-\nlike atomic species were fixed to be the values measured by the RGS\ndata. Key parameters in the hard X-ray model (e.g. ionization param-\neter, iron K\u03b1 line flux, etc.; see Schurch et al. 2003 for details) were\nfree parameters in the fit, but no contributions from iron L-shell tran-\nsitions were included in the fit. This highly restricted model does not\nprovide a good fit to the EPIC spectrum, with considerable residuals\nremaining below 2 keV. Relaxing the constraints of the model by in-\ncorporating a contribution from iron L-shell emission improves the\nfit considerably and results in similar values for the column densities\nof iron ionization states from Fe XVI\u2013XXIII to those found with the\nRGS. Despite the improvement, the overall fit remains poor, with\nconsiderable residuals still remaining across the soft X-ray region.\nRelaxing the constraints of the model more considerably by allow-\ning the column densities of the hydrogen- and helium-like atomic\nspecies to be free parameters in the model fit provides a reasonable\nfit to the broad-band X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 (\u03c72 = 2709\nfor 2194 degrees of freedom); however, residuals remain in the fit\nbelow 2 keV at a level of \u223c10 per cent (Fig. 4). The best-fitting\ncolumn densities for the hydrogen- and helium-like atomic species\nare typically within a factor of \u223c3 of the best-fitting column den-\nsities determined from the RGS modelling. We do not quote these\nvalues here because the relatively poor spectral resolution of the\nEPIC instruments results in considerable degeneracy between the\ncolumn densities measured for specific atomic species, making any\nspecific values at best unreliable and at worst misleading. Despite\nthis caveat, we note that the best-fitting column densities of N VII,\nNe X and Si XIV measured in the EPIC data are considerably lower in\ncomparison with those measured in the RGS data (factors of 3.5, 40\nand 16 respectively). The modelling is not significantly improved\nby the addition of either a soft X-ray power law (representing a scat-\ntered fraction of the underlying continuum) or blackbody emission\n(to represent the canonical \u2018soft X-ray excess\u2019 often observed in\ntype 1 Seyfert galaxies). Considerably more detailed modelling of\nthe RGS spectrum utilizing the additional data from the most recent\nXMM\u2013Newton observations of NGC 4151, coupled with improve-\nments in the relative instrument calibrations, is required before any\nfirm conclusions on the nature of the remaining fitting residuals can\nbe determined.\n6 S Y N O P S I S\nWe present a detailed analysis of the RGS spectrum of NGC 4151\nfrom a total of \u223c125 ks of XMM\u2013Newton observations. The EPIC\nspectra from these observations are presented in Schurch et al.\n(2003). The analysis uses the high spectral resolution of the RGS\ninstruments to characterize the nature and origin of the soft X-ray\nspectrum of NGC 4151.\n(i) The soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 (Fig. 1) is completely\ndominated by line emission and radiative recombination continua.\nLine emission, including higher-order (\u03b2\u2013\u03b5) resonance transitions,\nis clearly detected from hydrogen-like and helium-like ionization\nstates of neon, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon. Much of the uniden-\ntified line emission below \u223c16 \u00c5 can be associated with a combi-\nnation of iron L-shell emission and lines from hydrogen-like and\nhelium-like silicon and magnesium.\n(ii) The RGS spectra show no significant continuum emission\nand no fluorescent line emission associated with neutral material.\n(iii) The measured line centroid energies are consistent with a\nblueshift of between \u223c100 and 1000 km s\u22121, with respect to the\nsystemic velocity of NGC 4151. The seven observed linewidths\nthat are constrained by the data tentatively suggest a bimodal\ndistribution, with average linewidths of \u223c1000 and \u223c200 km\ns\u22121 (FWHM). The measured line blueshifts are generally consis-\ntent with the outflow velocities of the absorption lines observed\nin the UV spectrum of NGC 4151 (Kriss et al. 1995), imply-\ning that the UV and X-ray line features originate in the same\nmaterial.\n(iv) Plasma diagnostics, based on the ratios of the resonance,\nintercombination and forbidden lines of the observed helium-like\ntriplets, imply electron temperatures of \u223c(1\u20135) \u00d7 104 K and elec-\ntron densities of \u223c108 cm\u22123 in nitrogen and oxygen and \u223c1010 cm\u22123\nin neon (Porquet & Dubau 2000). We note again that the effects of\nphotoexcitation may have a considerable effect on the values of elec-\ntron temperature and density determined by these diagnostic ratios\n(see Section 3.3). The wide range of the calculated electron densi-\nties is suggestive of either a \u2018clumpy\u2019 extended narrow-line region\nor a region in which the material has grossly non-solar elemental\nabundances.\n(v) The soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 is remarkably similar\nto the soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 1068 (Kinkhabwala et al. 2002).\nThe correspondence between the two source spectra is evident on\nthe general scale from the strong emission lines and RRC associated\nwith the same ionic species, which dominate the spectra of both\nsources. The resemblance of the NGC 4151 and 1068 soft X-ray\nspectra is also apparent in the details of the spectra (i.e. the similar\nhelium-like triplet ratios and RRC temperatures).\n(vi) The \u2018ionization cone\u2019 model, developed by Kinkhabwala\net al. (2002) to model the RGS spectra of NGC 1068, reproduces all\nof the hydrogen-like and helium-like emission features observed in\nthe soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 in detail. The best-fitting ra-\ndial and transverse velocities of the material in the ionization cones\nagree well with the blueshift and velocity dispersion measured from\nthe individual line centroid energies, and are similar to the radial and\ntransverse velocities measured from the soft X-ray spectrum of NGC\n1068. The individual ionic column densities are somewhat smaller\nthan those measured for NGC 1068, which, in combination with the\nplasma diagnostic ratios from the helium-like triplets, suggests that\nthe material in the ionization cones of NGC 4151 may be somewhat\ndenser than the material in the ionization cones of NGC 1068.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 350, 1\u20139\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThe complex soft X-ray spectrum of NGC 4151 9\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nNJS gratefully acknowledges financial support from PPARC, and\nNJS and REG also acknowledge the support of NASA grant NAG5-\n9902.
