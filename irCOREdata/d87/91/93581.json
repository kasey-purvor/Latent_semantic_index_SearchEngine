We refer to the latter as aggregate balanced growth.\nThe restrictions needed to yield structural change consistent with the facts\nand aggregate balanced growth are weak restrictions on functional forms\nthat are frequently imposed by macroeconomists in related contexts.\nWe obtain our results in a baseline model of many consumption goods\nand a single capital good, supplied by a sector that we label manufacturing.\nOur baseline results are consistent with the existence of intermediate goods\nand many capital goods under some reasonable restrictions. Production\nfunctions in our model are identical in all sectors except for their rates of\nTFP growth and each sector produces a differentiated good that enters a\nconstant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function. We show that a\nlow (below one) elasticity of substitution across final goods leads to shifts\nof employment shares to sectors with low TFP growth. In the limit the\nemployment share used to produce consumption goods vanishes from all\nsectors except for the one with the smallest TFP growth rate, but the\nemployment shares used to produce capital goods and intermediate goods\nconverge to non-trivial stationary values. If the utility function in addition\nhas unit inter-temporal elasticity of substitution, during structural change\nthe aggregate capital-output ratio is constant and the aggregate economy\nis on a balanced growth path.\nOur results contrast with the results of Cristina Echevarria (1997), John\nLaitner (2000), Francesco Caselli and Wilbur Coleman II (2001) and Dou-\nglas Gollin, Stephen Parente and Richard Rogerson (2002) who derived\nstructural change in a two- or three-sector economy with non-homothetic\npreferences. Our results also contrast with the results of Piyabha Kongsamut,\nSergio Rebelo and Danyang Xie (2001) and Reto Foellmi and Josef Zweimuller\n(2005), who derived simultaneous constant aggregate growth and struc-\ntural change. Kongsamut et al. (2001) obtain their results by imposing a\nrestriction that maps some of the parameters of their Stone-Geary utility\nfunction onto the parameters of the production functions, abandoning one\nof the most useful conventions of modern macroeconomics, the complete in-\ndependence of preferences and technologies. Foellmi and Zweimuller (2005)\nobtain their results by assuming endogenous growth driven by the intro-\nduction of new goods into a hierarchic utility function. Our restrictions are\nquantitative restrictions on a conventional CES utility function that main-\ntains the independence of the parameters of preferences and technologies.\n2\nOur results confirm William J Baumol\u2019s (1967) claims about structural\nchange. Baumol divided the economy into two sectors, a \u201cprogressive\u201d one\nthat uses new technology and a \u201cstagnant\u201d one that uses labor as the only\ninput. He then claimed that the production costs and prices of the stagnant\nsector should rise indefinitely, a process known as \u201cBaumol\u2019s cost disease,\u201d\nand labor should move in the direction of the stagnant sector.1\nIn the more recent empirical literature two competing explanations\n(which can coexist) have been put forward for structural change. Our ex-\nplanation, which is sometimes termed \u201ctechnological\u201d because it attributes\nstructural change to different rates of sectoral TFP growth, and a utility-\nbased explanation, which requires different income elasticities for different\ngoods and can yield structural change even with equal TFP growth in all\nsectors. Baumol, Sue Anne Batey Blackman and Edward N. Wolff (1985)\nprovide empirical evidence at the 2-digit industry level, consistent with our\nmodel. Irving B. Kravis, Alan W. Heston and Robert Summers (1983) also\npresent evidence that favors the technological explanation, at least when\nthe comparison is between manufacturing and services. Two features of\ntheir data that are satisfied by the technological explanation proposed in\nthis paper are (a) relative prices reflect differences in TFP growth rates\nand (b) real consumption shares vary a lot less over time than nominal\nconsumption shares.2 Our model is also consistent with the observed pos-\nitive correlation between employment growth and relative price inflation\nacross two-digit sectors3 and with historical OECD evidence presented by\nSimon Kuznets (1966) and Angus Maddison (1980) for one-digit sectors.4\n1Baumol controversially also claimed that as more weight is shifted to the stagnant\nsector, the economy\u2019s growth rate will be on a declining trend and eventually converge\nto zero. This claim contrasts with our finding that the economy is on a balanced-growth\npath. We get our result because we include capital in our analysis, ironically left out\nof the analysis by Baumol (1967, p.417) \u201cprimarily for ease of exposition ... that is\n[in]essential to the argument\u201d.\n2See Rodney E. Falvey and Norman Gemmell (1996) for an update of some of their\nresults. Falvey and Gemmell find a unit income elasticity and a small (negative) price\nelasticity for services in a cross-section of countries, consistent with our results.\n3These correlations are shown in the working paper version of this paper, L. Rachel\nNgai and Christopher A. Pissarides (2004).\n4Kuznets (1966) documented structural change for 13 OECD countries and the USSR\nbetween 1800 and 1960 and Maddison (1980) documented the same pattern for 16 OECD\ncountries from 1870 to 1987. They both found a pattern with the same general features\nas the predictions that we obtain when the ranking of the average historical TFP growth\nrates is agriculture followed by manufacturing followed by services.\n3\nSection 1 describes our model of growth with many sectors and sec-\ntions 2 and 3 respectively derive the conditions for structural change and\nbalanced aggregate growth. In sections 4 and 5 we study two extensions\nof our baseline model, one where consumption goods can also be used as\nintermediate inputs and one where there are many capital goods. The\nAppendix discusses the implications of one more extension, differences in\ncapital intensities across sectors, and contains proofs of the main results.\n1 An economy with many sectors\nThe baseline economy consists of an arbitrary number ofm sectors. Sectors\ni = 1, ...,m\u2212 1 produce only consumption goods. The last sector, which is\ndenoted by m and labeled manufacturing, produces both a final consump-\ntion good and the economy\u2019s capital stock. We derive the equilibrium as\nthe solution to a social planning problem. The objective function is\nU =\nZ \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03c1tv (c1, .., cm) dt, (1)\nwhere \u03c1 > 0, ci \u2265 0 are per-capita consumption levels and the instanta-\nneous utility function v (.) is concave and satisfies the Inada conditions.\nThe constraints of the problem are as follows.\nThe labor force is exogenous and growing at rate \u03bd and the aggregate\ncapital stock is endogenous and defines the state of the economy. Sectoral\nallocations are controls that satisfyPm\ni=1 ni = 1;\nPm\ni=1 niki = k, (2)\nwhere ni \u2265 0 is the employment share and ki \u2265 0 is the capital-labor ratio\nin sector i, and k \u2265 0 is the aggregate capital-labor ratio. There is free\nmobility for both factors.\nAll production in sectors i = 1, ...,m \u2212 1 is consumed but in sector m\nproduction may be either consumed or invested. Therefore:\nci = F i (niki, ni) \u2200i 6= m (3)\nk\u02d9 = Fm(nmkm, nm)\u2212 cm \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03bd) k (4)\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 is the depreciation rate. Production function F i (., .) has\nconstant return to scale, positive and diminishing returns to inputs, and\nsatisfies the Inada conditions.\n4\nThe social planner chooses the allocation of factors ni and ki across m\nsectors through a set of static efficiency conditions,\nvi\/vm = FmK \/F\ni\nK = F\nm\nN \/F\ni\nN \u2200i. (5)\nThe allocation of output to consumption and capital is chosen through a\ndynamic efficiency condition,\n\u2212v\u02d9m\/vm = FmK \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03c1+ \u03bd) . (6)\nwhere F iN and F\ni\nK are the marginal products of labor and capital in sector\ni.5 By (5), the rates of return to capital and labor are equal across sectors.\nIn order to focus on the implications of different rates of TFP growth\nacross sectors we assume production functions are identical in all sectors\nexcept for their rates of TFP growth:\nF i = AiF (niki, ni) ; A\u02d9i\/Ai = \u03b3i; \u2200i, (7)\nWith these production functions, we show in the Appendix that static\nefficiency and the resource constraints (2) imply\nki = k; pi\/pm = vi\/vm = Am\/Ai; \u2200i, (8)\nwhere pi is the price of good i in the decentralized economy.\nThe utility function has constant elasticities both across goods and over\ntime:\nv (c1, ..., cm) =\n\u03c6 (.)1\u2212\u03b8 \u2212 1\n1\u2212 \u03b8 ; \u03c6 (.) =\n\u00b3Pm\ni=1 \u03c9ic\n(\u03b5\u22121)\/\u03b5\ni\n\u00b4\u03b5\/(\u03b5\u22121)\n(9)\nwhere \u03b8, \u03b5, \u03c9i > 0 and \u03a3\u03c9i = 1. Of course, if \u03b8 = 1, v(.) = ln\u03c6(.) and\nif \u03b5 = 1, ln\u03c6(.) =\nPm\ni=1 \u03c9i ln ci. In the decentralized economy demand\nfunctions have constant price elasticity \u2212\u03b5 and unit income elasticity. With\nthis utility function, (8) yields:\npici\npmcm\n=\n\u00b5\n\u03c9i\n\u03c9m\n\u00b6\u03b5\u00b5Am\nAi\n\u00b61\u2212\u03b5\n\u2261 xi \u2200i. (10)\nThe new variable xi is the ratio of consumption expenditure on good i to\nconsumption expenditure on the manufacturing good and will prove useful\nin the subsequent analysis. The intuition behind this formula is in terms\n5The corresponding transversality condition is lim\nt\u2212\u2192\u221e\nk exp\n\u00b3\n\u2212\nR t\n0\n(Fmk \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 \u03bd) d\u03c4\n\u00b4\n=\n0.\n5\nof price elasticities, given that all goods have unit income elasticity. The\nratio of consumption expenditures is a weighted average of the ratio of the\nweights of each good in the utility function and of their relative prices. A\nhigher price ratio pi\/pm raises the ratio of expenditure on good i to good\nm by one minus their common price elasticity.\nWe also define aggregate consumption expenditure and output per capita\nin terms of manufacturing:\nc \u2261\nPm\ni=1\npi\npm\nci; y \u2261\nPm\ni=1\npi\npm\nF i (11)\nUsing static efficiency we derive:\nc = cmX; y = AmF (k, 1) (12)\nwhere X \u2261\nPm\ni=1 xi.\n2 Structural change\nWe define structural change as the state in which at least some of the labor\nshares are changing over time, i.e., n\u02d9i 6= 0 for at least some i. We derive in\nthe Appendix (Lemma A2) the employment shares:\nni =\nxi\nX\n\u00b5\nc\ny\n\u00b6\n\u2200i 6= m, (13)\nnm =\nxm\nX\n\u00b5\nc\ny\n\u00b6\n+\n\u00b5\n1\u2212 c\ny\n\u00b6\n. (14)\nThe first term in the right side of (14) parallels the term in (13) and so\nrepresents the employment needed to satisfy the consumption demand for\nthe manufacturing good. The second bracketed term is equal to the sav-\nings rate and represents the manufacturing employment needed to satisfy\ninvestment demand.\nConditions (13) and (14) drive our structural change results. To see the\nintuition behind them, note that by aggregation over all i, we obtain that\nin our economy the employment share used to produce consumption goods\nis equal to c\/y, and the employment share used to produce capital goods is\n1\u2212 c\/y. Conditions (13) and (14) state that the same holds for each sector\ni. From (10) and (12), the consumption expenditure share of each sector is\npici\/pmc = xi\/X. So the employment share of consumption good i is the\nconsumption share of good i multiplied by the employment share of total\n6\nconsumption. Equivalently, the employment share of consumption good i\nis the average propensity to consume good i : ni = pici\/pmy.\nCondition (13) has the important implication that the growth rate of\ntwo sectors\u2019 relative employment depends only on the difference between\nthe sectors\u2019 TFP growth rates and the elasticity of substitution between\ngoods:\nn\u02d9i\nni\n\u2212 n\u02d9j\nnj\n= (1\u2212 \u03b5)\n\u00a1\n\u03b3j \u2212 \u03b3i\n\u00a2\n\u2200i, j 6= m. (15)\nBut (8) implies that the growth rate of relative prices is:\np\u02d9i\npi\n\u2212 p\u02d9j\npj\n= \u03b3j \u2212 \u03b3i \u2200i (16)\nand so,\nn\u02d9i\nni\n\u2212 n\u02d9j\nnj\n= (1\u2212 \u03b5)\n\u00b5\np\u02d9i\npi\n\u2212 p\u02d9j\npj\n\u00b6\n\u2200i, j 6= m (17)\nProposition 1 The rate of change of the relative price of good i to good j\nis equal to the difference between the TFP growth rates of sector j and sector\ni. In sectors producing only consumption goods, relative employment shares\ngrow in proportion to relative prices, with the factor of proportionality given\nby one minus the elasticity of substitution between goods.6\nThe dynamics of the individual employment shares satisfy:\nn\u02d9i\nni\n=\nc\/\u02d9y\nc\/y\n+ (1\u2212 \u03b5) (\u03b3\u00af \u2212 \u03b3i) ; \u2200i 6= m (18)\nn\u02d9m\nnm\n=\n\"\nc\/\u02d9y\nc\/y\n+ (1\u2212 \u03b5) (\u03b3\u00af \u2212 \u03b3m)\n#\n(c\/y) (xm\/X)\nnm\n(19)\n+\n\u00c3\n\u2212c\/\u02d9y\n1\u2212 c\/y\n!\u00b5\n1\u2212 c\/y\nnm\n\u00b6\nwhere \u03b3\u00af \u2261\nPm\ni=1 (xi\/X) \u03b3i is a weighted average of TFP growth rates, with\nthe weight given by each good\u2019s consumption share.\nEquation (18) gives the growth rate in the employment share of each\nconsumption good as a linear function of its own TFP growth rate. The\nintercept and slope of this function are common across sectors but although\nthe slope is a constant, the intercept is in general a function of time because\nboth c\/y and \u03b3\u00af are in general functions of time. Manufacturing, however,\ndoes not conform to this rule, because its employment share is a weighted\n6All derivations and proofs, unless trivial, are collected in the Appendix.\n7\naverage of two components, one for the production of the consumption\ngood, which conforms to the rule, and one for the production of capital\ngoods, which behaves differently.\nThe properties of structural change follow immediately from (18) and\n(19). Consider first the case of equality in sectoral TFP growth rates, i.e.,\nlet \u03b3i = \u03b3m \u2200i. Our economy in this case is one of balanced TFP growth,\nwith relative prices remaining constant but with many differentiated goods.\nBecause of the constancy of relative prices all consumption goods can be\naggregated into one, so we effectively have a two-sector economy, one sector\nproducing consumption goods and one producing capital goods. Structural\nchange can still take place in this economy but only between the aggregate\nof the consumption sectors and the capital sector, and only if c\/y changes\nover time. If c\/y is increasing over time, the investment rate is falling and\nlabor is moving out of the manufacturing sector and into the consumption\nsectors. Conversely, if c\/y is falling over time labor is moving out of the\nconsumption sectors and into manufacturing. In both cases, however, the\nrelative employment shares in consumption sectors are constant.\nIf c\/y is constant over time, structural change requires \u03b5 6= 1 and differ-\nent rates of sectoral TFP growth rates. It follows immediately from (16),\n(18) and (19) that if c\/\u02d9y = 0, \u03b5 = 1 implies constant employment shares\nbut changing prices. With constant employment shares faster-growing sec-\ntors produce relatively more output over time. Price changes in this case\nare such that consumption demands exactly match all the output changes\ndue to the different TFP growth rates. But if \u03b5 6= 1, prices still change\nas before but consumption demands are either too inelastic (in the case\n\u03b5 < 1) to match all the output change, or are too elastic (\u03b5 > 1) to be\nsatisfied merely by the change in output due to TFP growth. So if \u03b5 < 1\nemployment has to move into the slow-growing sectors and if \u03b5 > 1 it has\nto move into the fast-growing sectors.\nProposition 2 If \u03b3i = \u03b3m \u2200i 6= m, a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor structural change is c\u02d9\/c 6= y\u02d9\/y. The structural change in this case is\nbetween the aggregate of consumption sectors and the manufacturing sector.\nIf c\u02d9\/c = y\u02d9\/y, necessary and sufficient conditions for structural change\nare \u03b5 6= 1 and \u2203i \u2208 {1, ..,m\u2212 1} s.t. \u03b3i 6= \u03b3m. The structural change in this\ncase is between all sector pairs with different TFP growth rates. If \u03b5 < 1\nemployment moves from the sector with the higher TFP growth rate to the\nsector with the lower TFP growth rate; conversely if \u03b5 > 1.\n8\nProposition 2 for \u03b5 < 1 confirms the structural change facts identified\nby Baumol et al. (1985). When demand is price inelastic, the sectors with\nthe low productivity growth rate attract a bigger share of labor, despite\nthe rise in their price. From the static efficiency results in (8) and (12)\nwe find that the nominal output shares (defined as piF i\/pmy) are equal to\nthe employment shares in all sectors, and by (10) the nominal consumption\nshares are given by xi\/X, so the results obtained for employment shares also\nhold for nominal consumption and output shares. But real consumption\ngrowth satisfies\nc\u02d9i\/ci \u2212 c\u02d9j\/cj = \u03b5\n\u00a1\n\u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3j\n\u00a2\n; \u2200i, j, (20)\nan expression also satisfied by real output shares \u2200i, j 6= m.\nA comparison of (15) with (20) reveals that a small \u03b5 can reconcile\nthe small changes in the relative real consumption shares with the large\nchanges in relative nominal consumption shares found by Kravis et al.\n(1983). The authors concluded that their finding is evidence in favor of the\ntechnological explanation of structural change. More recently Daniel E.\nSichel (1997) found the same pattern for relative output shares, and Falvey\nand Gemmell (1996) found that the real consumption share of services (a\nsector with low TFP growth rate) falls very gradually with income, both\nof which are consistent with our model when \u03b5 < 1.\n3 Aggregate growth\nWe now study the aggregate growth path of this economy, with the objec-\ntive of finding a sufficient set of conditions that satisfy structural change as\nderived in the preceding section, and in addition satisfy Kaldor\u2019s stylized\nfacts of aggregate growth. Recall that for the analysis of structural change\nwe imposed a Hicks-neutral technology. It is well-known that with this type\nof technology, the economy can be on a steady state only if the production\nfunction is Cobb-Douglas. We therefore let F (niki, ni) = k\u03b1i ni, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) .7\nWith TFP in each sector growing at some rate \u03b3i, the aggregate economy\nwill also grow at some rate related to the \u03b3is. The following Proposition\nderives the evolution of the aggregate economy:\n7Daron Acemoglu and Veronica Guerrieri (2005) examined the implications of dif-\nferent capital intensities for economic growth and structural change. They show that\ncapital deepening can cause both structural change and unbalanced growth. We exam-\nine in the Appendix the implications of different capital shares and a fixed factor for\nour model.\n9\nProposition 3 Given any initial k(0), the equilibrium of the aggregate\neconomy is a path for the pair {c, k} that satisfies the following two dif-\nferential equations:\nk\u02d9\nk\n= Amk\u03b1\u22121 \u2212\nc\nk\n\u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03bd) , (21)\n\u03b8\nc\u02d9\nc\n= (\u03b8 \u2212 1) (\u03b3m \u2212 \u03b3\u00af) + \u03b1Amk\u03b1\u22121 \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03c1+ \u03bd) . (22)\nWe define an aggregate balanced growth path such that aggregate out-\nput, consumption and capital grow at the same rate. It follows from Propo-\nsition 3 that a necessary condition for the existence of an aggregate bal-\nanced growth path is that the expression (\u03b8 \u2212 1) (\u03b3m \u2212 \u03b3\u00af) be a constant.\nTo show this, let:\n(\u03b8 \u2212 1)(\u03b3m \u2212 \u03b3\u00af) \u2261 \u03c8 constant. (23)\nDefine aggregate consumption and the capital-labor ratio in terms of effi-\nciency units, ce \u2261 cA\u22121\/(1\u2212\u03b1)m and ke \u2261 kA\u22121\/(1\u2212\u03b1)m and let gm \u2261 \u03b3m\/(1\u2212\u03b1),\nthe rate of labor-augmenting technological growth in the capital-producing\nsector.\nThe dynamic equations (21) and (22) become\nc\u02d9e\/ce =\n\u00a3\n\u03b1k\u03b1\u22121e + \u03c8 \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03bd + \u03c1)\n\u00a4\n\/\u03b8 \u2212 gm (24)\nk\u02d9e = k\u03b1e \u2212 ce \u2212 (gm + \u03b4 + \u03bd) ke. (25)\nEquations (24) and (25) parallel the two differential equations in the con-\ntrol and state of the one-sector Ramsey economy, making the aggregate\nequilibrium of our many-sector economy identical to the equilibrium of the\none-sector Ramsey economy when \u03c8 = 0, and trivially different from it\notherwise. Both models have a saddlepath equilibrium and stationary so-\nlutions\n\u00b3\nc\u02c6e, k\u02c6e\n\u00b4\nthat imply balanced growth in the three aggregates. The\ncapital-labor ratio is growing at the rate of growth of labor-augmenting\ntechnological progress in the sector that produces capital goods, gm. Ag-\ngregate consumption and output deflated by the price of manufacturing\ngoods are also growing at the same rate.\nProposition 2 and the requirement that \u03c8 be constant yield the impor-\ntant Proposition:\nProposition 4 Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an\naggregate balanced growth path with structural change are:\n\u03b8 = 1,\n\u03b5 6= 1; and \u2203i \u2208 {1, ..,m\u2212 1} s.t. \u03b3i 6= \u03b3m.\n10\nRecalling the definition of \u03b3\u00af following equation (19), Proposition 3 im-\nplies that the contribution of each consumption sector i to aggregate equi-\nlibrium is through its weight xi in \u03b3\u00af. Because each xi depends on the sector\u2019s\nrelative TFP level, the weights here are functions of time. So \u03b3\u00af cannot be\nconstant during structural change and the only way that \u03c8 can be constant\nis through \u03b8 = 1, which yields \u03c8 = 0. In this case our aggregate economy\nin c and k becomes formally identical to the one-sector Ramsey economy\nwith growth rate \u03b3m. There are two other conditions that give a constant\n\u03c8 and so yield balanced aggregate growth: \u03b3i = \u03b3m \u2200i or \u03b5 = 1. But as\nProposition 2 demonstrates neither condition permits structural change on\nthe balanced growth path, where c\/y is constant.\nProposition 4 requires the utility function to be logarithmic in the con-\nsumption composite \u03c6, which implies an intertemporal elasticity of substi-\ntution equal to one, but be non-logarithmic across goods, which is needed\nto yield non-unit price elasticities. A noteworthy implication of Proposi-\ntion 4 is that balanced aggregate growth does not require constant rates\nof growth of TFP in any sector other than manufacturing. Because both\ncapital and labor are perfectly mobile across sectors, changes in the TFP\ngrowth rates of consumption-producing sectors are reflected in immediate\nprice changes and reallocations of capital and labor across sectors, without\neffect on the aggregate growth path.\nTo give intuition for the logarithmic intertemporal utility function we\nrecall that balanced aggregate growth requires that aggregate consumption\nbe a constant fraction of aggregate wealth. With our homothetic utility\nfunction this can be satisfied either when the interest rate is constant or\nwhen consumption is independent of the interest rate. The relevant interest\nrate here is the rate of return to capital in consumption units, which is\ngiven by the net marginal product of capital, \u03b1y\/k \u2212 \u03b4, minus the change\nin the relative price of the consumption composite, \u03b3m \u2212 \u03b3\u00af. The latter\nis not constant during structural change. In the case \u03b5 < 1, \u03b3\u00af is falling\nover time (see Lemma A3 in the Appendix for proof), and so the real\ninterest rate is also falling, and converging to \u03b1y\/k\u2212\u03b4.With a non-constant\ninterest rate the consumption-wealth ratio is constant only if consumption\nis independent of the interest rate, which requires a logarithmic utility\nfunction.8\n8After re-examining the evidence, Robert Barro and Xavier Sala-i-Martin (2004,\np.13) concluded, consistent with our model, \u201cit seems likely that Kaldor\u2019s hypothesis of\na roughly stable real rate of return should be replaced by a tendency for returns to fall\n11\nUnder the condition of Proposition 4 there is a steady-state character-\nized by aggregate balanced growth, in the sense that in this steady state\nthe aggregate ratios are constant. In order to achieve this balance, the\naggregates c and y are divided by manufacturing price, to conform to the\naggregate k. If some other price index is used as deflator, the rate of growth\nof the aggregates is constant only if the rate of growth of the price index\nis constant, but of course the aggregate ratios are still constant. The pub-\nlished aggregate series studied by macroeconomists usually use an average\nprice as deflator which does not have fixed weights. If the price index used\nto deflate national statistics is some p\u02dc, the published real aggregate income\nis y\/p\u02dc. If the weights used to construct p\u02dc are the sector shares, p\u02dc changes\nduring structural change. But because sector shares do not change rapidly\nover time, visually there is virtually nothing to distinguish the \u201cstylized\nfact\u201d of constant growth in reported per capita GDP with another \u201cstyl-\nized fact\u201d of constant growth in our per capita output measure.9\nNext, we summarize the dynamics of employment shares along the ag-\ngregate balanced growth path.\nProposition 5 Let sector l denote the sector with the smallest TFP growth\nrate when \u03b5 < 1 or the sector with the biggest TFP growth rate when \u03b5 > 1.\nOn the aggregate balanced growth path, nl increases monotonically. Employ-\nment in the other sectors is either hump-shaped or declines monotonically.\nAsymptotically, the economy converges to an economy with\nn\u2217m = \u03c3\u02c6 = \u03b1\n\u00b5\n\u03b4 + \u03bd + gm\n\u03b4 + \u03bd + \u03c1+ gm\n\u00b6\n; n\u2217l = 1\u2212 \u03c3\u02c6\nwhere \u03c3\u02c6 is the savings rate along the aggregate balanced growth path.\nProposition 5 follows immediately from (18)-(19) and Lemma A3. Con-\nsider the case \u03b5 < 1, the one for \u03b5 > 1 following by a corresponding ar-\ngument. For \u03b5 < 1, sector i expands if and only if its TFP growth rate\nis smaller than \u03b3\u00af, and contracts if and only if its growth rate exceeds it.\nBut if \u03b5 < 1, the weighted average \u03b3\u00af is decreasing over time (see Lemma\nA3 in the Appendix). Therefore, the set of expanding sectors is shrinking\nover some range as an economy develops.\u201d In our model it is converging from above to\na positive value.\n9Nicholas Kaldor (1961, p.178) spoke of a \u201csteady trend rate\u201d of growth in the \u201cag-\ngregate volume of production.\u201d In Ngai and Pissarides (2004, Fig.4) we plot our series\nof per capita real incomes and the published chain-weighted series for the United States\nsince 1929, and show that they are virtually indistinguishable from each other.\n12\nover time, as more sectors\u2019 TFP growth rates exceed \u03b3\u00af. This feature of\nthe model implies that sectors with TFP growth rates below the initial \u03b3\u00af\nexhibit a hump-shaped employment share, an implication that we believe is\nunique to our model. These employment shares first rise but once \u03b3\u00af drops\ndown to their own \u03b3i they fall.\n10\nIn contrast to each sector\u2019s employment share, once the economy is\non the aggregate balanced growth path output and consumption in each\nconsumption sector grow according to\nF\u02d9 i\nF i\n=\nA\u02d9i\nAi\n+ \u03b1\nk\u02d9i\nk\n+\nn\u02d9i\nni\n= \u03b5\u03b3i + \u03b1gm + (1\u2212 \u03b5) \u03b3\u00af. (26)\nIf \u03b5 6 1 the rate of growth of consumption and output in each sector is\npositive (provided \u03b3i \u2265 0), and so sectors never vanish, even though their\nemployment shares in the limit may vanish. If \u03b5 > 1 the rate of growth of\noutput may be negative in some low-growth sectors, and since by Lemma\nA3 \u03b3\u00af is rising over time in this case, their rate of growth remains indefinitely\nnegative until they vanish.\nFinally, we examine briefly the implications of \u03b8 6= 1. When \u03b8 6= 1\nbalanced aggregate growth cannot coexist with structural change, because\nthe term \u03c8 = (\u03b8 \u2212 1) (\u03b3m \u2212 \u03b3\u00af) in the Euler condition (24) is a function\nof time. But as shown in the Appendix Lemma A3, \u03b3\u00af is monotonic. As\nt \u2192 \u221e, \u03c8 converges to the constant (\u03b8 \u2212 1) (\u03b3m \u2212 \u03b3l), where \u03b3l is the\nTFP growth rate in the limiting sector (the slowest or fastest growing\nconsumption sector depending on whether \u03b5 < or > 1). Therefore, the\neconomy with \u03b8 6= 1 converges to an asymptotic steady state with the\nsame growth rate as the economy with \u03b8 = 1.\nWhat characterizes the dynamic path of the aggregate economy when\n\u03b8 6= 1? By differentiation and using Lemma A3, we obtain\n\u03c8\u02d9 = (\u03b8 \u2212 1)(1\u2212 \u03b5)\nPm\ni=1 (xi\/X) (\u03b3i \u2212 \u03b3\u00af)2 (27)\nwhich is of second-order compared with the growth in employment shares\nin (15), given that the \u03b3s are usually small numbers centered around 0.02.\nTherefore, the rate of growth of the economy during the adjustment to the\nasymptotic steady state with \u03b8 6= 1 is very close to the constant growth\n10Maddison (1980, p. 48) in his study of historical OECD data found a \u201cshallow bell\nshape\u201d for manufacturing employment for each of the 16 OECD countries, which can be\nreproduced by our model if the manufacturing TFP growth rate takes values between\nthe TFP growth rates of agriculture and services.\n13\nrate of the economy with \u03b8 = 1, despite ongoing structural change in both\neconomies.\n4 Intermediate goods\nOur baseline model has no intermediate inputs and has only one sector\nproducing capital goods. We now generalize it by introducing intermediate\ninputs and (in the next section) by allowing an arbitrary number of sectors\nto produce capital goods. The key difference between intermediate goods\nand capital goods is that capital goods are re-usable while intermediate\ngoods depreciate fully after one usage. The motivation for the introduction\nof intermediate inputs is that many of the sectors that may be classified as\nconsumption sectors produce in fact for businesses. Business services is one\nobvious example. Input-output tables show that a large fraction of output\nin virtually all sectors of the economy is sold to businesses.11\nAs in the baseline model, sectors are of two types. The first type pro-\nduces perishable goods that are either consumed by households or used\nas intermediate inputs by firms. We continue referring to these sectors as\nconsumption sectors. The second type of sector produces goods that can\nbe used as capital. For generality\u2019s sake, we assume that the output of\nthe capital-producing sector can also be processed into both consumption\ngoods and intermediate inputs.\nThe output of consumption sector i is now ci+hi, where hi is the output\nthat is used as an intermediate good. Manufacturing output can be con-\nsumed, cm, used as an intermediate input, hm, or used as new capital, k\u02d9.We\nassume that all intermediate goods hi are used as an input into an aggre-\ngate CES production function \u03a6(h1, ..., hm) =\nhPm\ni=1 \u03d5ih\n(\u03b7\u22121)\/\u03b7\ni\ni\u03b7\/(\u03b7\u22121)\nthat\nproduces a single intermediate good \u03a6, with \u03b7 > 0, \u03d5i \u2265 0 and \u03a3\u03d5i = 1.\nThe production functions are modified to F i = Ainik\u03b1i q\n\u03b2\ni , \u2200i, where qi is the\nratio of the intermediate good to employment in sector i and \u03b2 is its input\nshare, with \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 and \u03b1+\u03b2 < 1. When \u03b2 = 0, we return to our baseline\nmodel. We show in the Appendix that a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor an aggregate balanced growth path with structural change is \u03b7 = 1, i.e.\n11According to input-output tables for the United States, in 1990 the percentage dis-\ntribution of the output of two-digit sectors across three types of usage, final consumption\ndemand, intermediate goods and capital goods was 43, 48 and 9 respectively. In virtually\nall sectors, however, a large fraction of the intermediate goods produced are consumed\nby the same sector.\n14\n\u03a6(.) should be Cobb-Douglas.12 When \u03a6(.) is Cobb-Douglas, our central\nresults from the baseline model carry through, with some modifications.\nThe aggregate equilibrium is similar to the one in the baseline model:\nc\u02d9\nc\n= \u03b1Ak(\u03b1+\u03b2\u22121)\/(1\u2212\u03b2) \u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03c1+ \u03bd) , (28)\nk\u02d9\nk\n= (1\u2212 \u03b2)Ak(\u03b1+\u03b2\u22121)\/(1\u2212\u03b2) \u2212 c\nk\n\u2212 (\u03b4 + \u03bd) (29)\nwhere A \u2261\nh\nAm (\u03b2\u03a6m)\n\u03b2\ni1\/(1\u2212\u03b2)\nand \u03a6m is the marginal product of the\nmanufacturing good in \u03a6. The growth rate of A is constant and equal to\n\u03b3 = \u03b3m + (\u03b2\nPm\ni=1 \u03d5i\u03b3i) \/ (1\u2212 \u03b2) , where \u03d5i is the input share of sector\ni in \u03a6. Therefore, we can define aggregate consumption and the aggre-\ngate capital-labor ratio in terms of efficiency units and obtain an aggregate\nbalanced growth path with growth rate (\u03b3m + \u03b2\nPm\ni=1 \u03d5i\u03b3i) \/ (1\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 \u03b2) ,\nwhich is the sum of labor-augmenting technological growth in the capital-\nproducing sector and a \u03b2 fraction of labor-augmenting technological growth\nin all sectors that produce intermediate goods. Recall the aggregate growth\nrate in the baseline model depended only on the TFP growth rate in manu-\nfacturing. In the extended model with intermediate goods, the TFP growth\nrates in all sectors contribute to aggregate growth.\nThe employment shares (13) and (14) are now modified to:\nni =\nxi\nX\n\u00b5\nc\ny\n\u00b6\n+ \u03d5i\u03b2; \u2200i 6= m (30)\nnm =\n\u2219\nxm\nX\n\u00b5\nc\ny\n\u00b6\n+ \u03d5m\u03b2\n\u00b8\n+\n\u00b5\n1\u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 c\ny\n\u00b6\n. (31)\nFor the consumption sectors, the extra term in (30) captures the employ-\nment required for producing intermediate goods. \u03d5i is the share of sector i\u2019s\noutput used for intermediate purposes and \u03b2 is the share of the aggregate\nintermediate input in aggregate output. For the manufacturing sector, the\nterms in the first bracket parallel those of the consumption sectors. The\nsecond term captures the employment share for investment purposes.\nOur results on structural change now hold for the component of employ-\nment used to produce consumption goods, (xi\/X)(c\/y). The definition of xi\nand X is the same as in the absence of intermediate goods. The contribu-\ntion of intermediate goods to sectoral employment dynamics is the addition\n12Nicholas Oulton (2001) claims that if there are intermediate goods, and if the elastic-\nity of substitution between the intermediate goods and labor is bigger than 1, Baumol\u2019s\n\u201cstagnationist\u201d results could be overturned (in the absence of capital). No such possi-\nbility arises with Cobb-Douglas production functions.\n15\nof the constant employment share \u03d5i\u03b2, with no impact on the other two\ncomponents of employment. Following on from this, the asymptotic results\nin Proposition 5 are also modified. Asymptotically, the employment share\nused for the production of consumption goods still vanishes in all sectors\nexcept for the slowest growing one (when \u03b5 < 1), but the employment share\nused to produce intermediate goods, \u03d5i\u03b2, survives in all sectors.\n5 Many capital goods\nIn our second extension we allow an arbitrary number of sectors to produce\ncapital goods. We study this extension with the baseline model without\nintermediate inputs.\nWe suppose that there are \u03ba different capital-producing sectors, each\nsupplying the inputs into a production functionG, which produces a capital\naggregate that can be either consumed or used as an input in all production\nfunctions F i. Thus, the model is the same as before, except that now the\ncapital input ki is not the output of a single sector but of the production\nfunction G. The Appendix derives the equilibrium for the case of a CES\nfunction with elasticity \u00b5, i.e., when G =\nhP\u03ba\nj=1 \u03bemj (F\nmj)(\u00b5\u22121)\/\u00b5\ni\u00b5\/(\u00b5\u22121)\n,\nwhere \u00b5 > 0, \u03bemj \u2265 0 and Fmj is the output of each capital goods sectormj.\nG now replaces the output of the \u201cmanufacturing\u201d sector in our baseline\nmodel, Fm.\nIt follows immediately that the structural change results derived for\nthe m\u2212 1 consumption sectors remain intact, as we have made no changes\nto that part of the model. But there are new results to derive concern-\ning structural change within the capital-producing sectors. The relative\nemployment shares across the capital-producing sectors satisfy:\nnmj\/nmi =\n\u00b3\n\u03bemj\/\u03bemi\n\u00b4\u00b5 \u00a1\nAmi\/Amj\n\u00a21\u2212\u00b5\n; \u2200i, j = 1, .., \u03ba (32)\nn\u02d9mj\nnmj\n\u2212 n\u02d9mi\nnmi\n= (1\u2212 \u00b5)\n\u00b3\n\u03b3mi \u2212 \u03b3mj\n\u00b4\n; \u2200i, j = 1, .., \u03ba (33)\nThese equations parallel (13) and (15) of the baseline model and the intu-\nition behind them is the same.\nWhen there are many capital goods, the Am of the baseline model is\nreplaced by GmjAmj for each sector mj, where Gmj denotes the sector\u2019s\nmarginal product in the production of aggregate capital and Amj is the\nsector\u2019s TFP level. This term measures the rate of return to capital in the\njth capital-producing sector, which is equal across all \u03ba sectors because\n16\nof the free mobility of capital. In the Appendix we derive the aggregate\ngrowth rate:\n\u03b3m =\nP\u03ba\nj=1 \u03b6j\u03b3mj ; \u03b6j \u2261 \u03be\n\u00b5\nmjA\n(\u00b5\u22121)\nmj \/\n\u00a1P\u03ba\ni=1 \u03be\n\u00b5\nmiA\n(\u00b5\u22121)\nmi\n\u00a2\n, (34)\nwhich is a weighted average of TFP growth rates in all capital-producing\nsectors. The dynamic equations for c and k are the same as in the baseline\nmodel, given the new definition of \u03b3m.\nIf TFP growth rates are equal across all capital-producing sectors, c\nand k grow at a common rate in the steady state. But then all capital pro-\nducing sectors can be aggregated into one, and the model reduces to one\nwith a single capital-producing sector. If TFP growth rates are different\nacross the capital-producing sectors and \u00b5 6= 1, there is structural change\nwithin the capital-producing sectors along the transition to the asymptotic\nstate. Asymptotically, only one capital-producing sector remains. In the\nasymptotic state, c and k again grow at common rate, so there exists an as-\nymptotic aggregate balanced growth path with only one capital-producing\nsector.\nA necessary and sufficient condition for the coexistence of an aggregate\nbalanced growth path and multiple capital-producing sectors with different\nTFP growth rates is \u00b5 = 1. The reason for this result is that a balanced\naggregate path requires a constant \u03b3m, which is unattainable if the relative\nTFP levels in the capital-producing sectors are allowed to influence it.\nFrom (34), the influence of the productivity levels disappears only when\n\u00b5 = 1. The aggregate growth rate in this case is \u03b3m\/ (1\u2212 \u03b1) where \u03b3m =P\u03ba\nj=1 \u03bemj\u03b3mj . Using (32), the relative employment shares across capital-\nproducing sectors are equal to their relative input shares in G. There is\nno structural change within the capital producing sectors, their relative\nemployment shares remaining constant independently of their TFP growth\nrates.\nThe model with \u03b5 < 1 and \u00b5 = 1 has clear contrasting predictions about\nthe relation between the dynamics of sectoral employment shares and TFP\ngrowth (or relative prices). Sectors that produce primarily consumption\ngoods should exhibit a well-defined linear relation between their employ-\nment share growth and their TFP growth rate; sectors that produce many\nintermediate goods should still have a positive linear relation, but less well-\ndefined because of the constant term due to the production of intermediate\ngoods. But sectors that produce primarily capital goods should exhibit\nno linear relation at all between their employment share growth and their\n17\nrelative TFP growth rate.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have shown that different TFP growth rates across industrial sectors\npredict sectoral employment changes that are consistent with the facts if\nthe substitutability between the final goods produced by each sector is low.\nBalanced aggregate growth requires in addition a logarithmic intertempo-\nral utility function. Underlying the balanced aggregate growth there is\na shift of employment away from sectors with high rate of technological\nprogress towards sectors with low growth, and eventually, in the limit, all\nemployment converges to only two sectors, the sector producing capital\ngoods and the sector with the lowest rate of productivity growth. If the\neconomy also produces intermediate goods the sectors that produce these\ngoods also retain some employment in the limit, which is used to produce\nthe intermediate goods.\nOur results are consistent with the observation of simultaneous growth\nin the relative prices and employment shares of stagnant sectors such as\ncommunity services, with the near-constancy of real consumption shares\nwhen compared with nominal shares. It is also consistent with the long-run\nevidence of Kuznets (1966) and Maddison (1980) concerning the decline of\nagriculture\u2019s employment share, the rise and then fall of the manufacturing\nshare and the rise in the service share. The key requirement for these results\nis again a low substitutability between final goods. Of course, at a finer\nsector decomposition the elasticity of substitution between two goods may\nreasonably exceed unity; as for example between the output of the sector\nproducing typewriters and the output of the sector producing electronic\nword processors. Our model in this case predicts that labor would move\nfrom the sector with low TFP growth to the one with the high TFP growth.\nThe approach that we suggested for intermediate and many capital goods,\nnamely the existence of subsectors that produce an aggregate that enters\nthe utility or production function, is an obvious approach to the analysis of\nthese cases. Within the subsectors there is structural change towards the\nhigh TFP goods but between the aggregates the flow is from high to low\nTFP sectors.\n18\nAppendix: Proofs\nLemma A1 Equations (2), (5) and (7) imply equation (8).\nProof. Define f (k) \u2261 F (k, 1) , omitting subscript i, (7) implies FK =\nAf 0 (k) and FN = A [f (k)\u2212 kf 0 (k)] . So FN\/FK = f (k) \/f 0 (k)\u2212 k, which\nis strictly increasing in k.

The\nproduction function is F i = Aik\n\u03b1i\ni z\n1\u2212\u03b1i\u2212\u03b2i\ni ni, where \u03b2i is labor share and zi =\nZi\/Ni is a fixed factor per unit of labor. Suppose \u03b1i+\u03b2i= 1 for i 6= 1, and\n\u03b11+\u03b21< 1, i.e. the fixed factor is used in sector 1 only. Static efficiency implies\nni\/nj =\n\u00a1\n\u03b2i\/\u03b2j\n\u00a2\n(\u03c9i\/\u03c9m)\n\u03b5 (pi\/pj)\n1\u2212\u03b5 , \u2200i, j 6= m,\nso the result that relative employment shares grow in proportion to relative\nprices, equation (17), is independent of different factor shares and the existence\nof a fixed factor . Our other results are modified as follows. The static efficiency\ncondition (8) is replaced by\nki = \u03bbikm, pi\/pm = (Am\/Ai) (\u03c2m\/\u03c2 i) k\u03b1m\u2212\u03b1im z\n\u03b1i+\u03b2i\u22121\ni ;\n\u03bbi \u2261\n\u03b2m\u03b1i\n\u03b2i\u03b1m\n, \u03c2 i \u2261 \u03b1\u03b1ii \u03b21\u2212\u03b1ij .\nDifferent capital shares add the term (\u03b1m \u2212 \u03b1i) k\u02d9m\/km in (16). In a growth\nequilibrium with km growing, lower \u03b1i is another reason for higher relative price\nin sector i. Combining the relative price and relative employment equations,\ndifferent capital shares add the term (1\u2212 \u03b5) (\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b1i) k\u02d9m\/km in (15). The\nexistence of a fixed factor modifies (15) to\n[1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21) (1\u2212 \u03b5)]\nn\u02d91\nn1\n\u2212 n\u02d9j\nnj\n= (1\u2212 \u03b5)\n\u00a1\n\u03b3j \u2212 \u03b31\n\u00a2\n+(1\u2212 \u03b5) (\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b11)\nk\u02d9m\nkm\n,\n\u2200j 6= m. If n1 is falling, then the presence of a fixed factor implies that n1 falls\nat a faster rate.
