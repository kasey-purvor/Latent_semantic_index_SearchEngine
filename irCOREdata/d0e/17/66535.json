In this paper we develop a new palaeogeographic \nmodel for this depositional complex using a large dataset of recently acquired litho-, \nbio- and chrono-stratigraphic data.  Our analysis shows how, over the last 2000 years, \nthree large tidal inlets have influenced the pattern of back-barrier inundation and \nsedimentation, and controlled the stability and evolution of the barrier by determining \nthe location of cross-shore sediment and water exchange, thereby moderating \nsediment supply and its distribution. The sheer size of the foreland has contributed in \npart to its resilience, with an abundant supply of sediment always available for ready \nredistribution.

Humans \nemerge as key agents of change, especially through the process of reclamation which \nfrom the Saxon period onwards has modified the back-barrier tidal prism and \npromoted repeated episodes of fine-grained sedimentation and channel\/inlet infill and \nclosure.  Our palaeogeographic reconstructions show that large barriers such as \nDungeness Foreland can survive repeated \u201ccatastrophic\u201d breaches, especially where \ntidal inlets are able to assist the recovery process by raising the elevation of the back-\nbarrier area by intertidal sedimentation.  This research leads us to reflect on the \nconcept of \u201ccoastal resilience\u201d which, we conclude, means little without a clearly \ndefined spatial and temporal framework.  At a macro-scale, the structure as a whole \nentered a phase of recycling and rapid progradation in response to changing sediment \nbudget and coastal dynamics about 2000 years ago. However, at smaller spatial and \ntemporal scales, barrier inlet dynamics have been associated with the initiation, \nstabilisation and breakdown of individual beaches and complexes of beaches.  We \ntherefore envisage multiple scales of \u201cresilience\u201d operating simultaneously across the \ncomplex, responding to different forcing agents with particular magnitudes and \nfrequencies.   \n \nKeywords: Barrier; Gravel; Inlet system; Saltmarsh; Reclamation; Sea-level change \n \n*Corresponding author (email: A.J.Long@Durham.ac.uk) \n \n1. Introduction \n \n\u201cCoastal resilience\u201d describes the self-organising ability of a coast to respond \nin a sustainable manner to morphological, biological and\/or socio-economic pressures \n(Klein et al., 1998).  From a morphological perspective, it is a concept that is helpful \nin understanding the ability of a coastal landform to respond to external drivers that \ninclude relative sea-level (RSL) rise, an increase in storm magnitude\/frequency, or a \nfall in sediment supply.  A morphologically resilient coast is one that can maintain its \nlong-term form despite experiencing short-term variations in the forcing processes, \nincluding sediment supply, on which it depends.  Sand and gravel barriers can \ndemonstrate morphological resilience over a range of temporal and spatial scales.  \n 2\n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \nOver short-timescales (days to years), barriers may demonstrate resilience by \ndissipating or reflecting the energy of high waves or large storms and, though \nexperiencing a degree of morphological change, are nevertheless able to maintain \ntheir structural integrity.  However, barrier resilience over longer time-scales can \ninvolve larger-scale dynamic adjustment due to changes in RSL or variations in \nsediment supply with, for example, changes in inlet dynamics or phases of barrier \nprogradation or erosion.  Observational and geological records also show that the \nmorphological and dynamic resilience of barriers can be exceeded when a \ngeomorphological threshold is crossed and a barrier breaks down (Forbes et al., 1995; \nJennings et al., 1998).   \n \nConceptual models for the development of coarse clastic barriers suggest that \nbarrier evolution, and by extension barrier resilience, is controlled by the interplay \nbetween the rate of RSL rise, sediment supply, longshore drift, basement topography, \nas well as storm incidence and magnitude (Orford et al., 1991, 2002).  In general, low-\ngradient swash-aligned coasts that experience RSL rise are characterised by \ntransgressive barriers whose resilience is strongly determined by the rate at which \nsediment is eroded from the shoreface and transported into the back-barrier (Roy et \nal., 1994).  In the case of headland spits, such as Dungeness Foreland, these are \nprogradational barrier complexes that extend down-drift in response to a dominant \nlittoral drift pattern.  Their morphological resilience depends on sufficient sediment \nsupply along the barrier length.  Progressive down-drift extension of these drift-\naligned structures is characterised by the deposition of successive beach ridges.  New \nridge progradation occurs episodically during storms, although tidal currents are \ninvolved in building the sub-tidal platform on which the beaches accumulate. \n \nMaintaining coastal resilience is increasingly viewed as a desirable outcome \nfor coastal management since a resilient coast is better able to accommodate \nperturbations driven by natural and anthropogenic processes than one that has limited \ncapacity for internal change (Nicholls and Bransen, 1998).  However, we still do not \nthoroughly understand the roles that morphology, palaeogeography and sediment \nsupply play in the resilience of sand and gravel barriers over century to millennial \ntime-scales.  This information gap has meant that many current coastal defence and \n 3\n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \nerosion protection measures may not be attuned to the response mechanisms through \nwhich coastal resilience is enhanced. \n \nIn this paper we explore the evolution and resilience of Dungeness Foreland, a \nlarge sand and gravel barrier located in the eastern English Channel (Fig. 1) that \ncomprises several hundred storm beaches that date from at least 4000 calibrated years \nbefore present (cal. yrs BP, AD 1950).  Dungeness Foreland encloses an extensive \narea of fine-grained marsh sediments that have accumulated in the lee of the barrier \n(now Romney, Walland and Denge marshes).  A recent programme of research, \ninvolving coring and analyses of back-barrier and barrier sediments, enables us to \ndevelop a new palaeogeographic model for the study area based on a review of a large \ndatabase of palaeoenvironmental information.  This model is based on several \nthousand boreholes, over 40 radiocarbon-dated microfossil diagrams, 39 new \nOptically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) age determinations, as well as a rich \narchival and archaeological record summarised in a set of recent research monographs \n(Eddison and Green, 1988; Eddison, 1995; Eddison et al., 1998; Long et al., 2002) \nand web-based material (www.romneymarsh.net).  Our focus is on the role of coastal \nmorphology and palaeogeography in controlling coastal resilience over different \nspatial and temporal scales.   \n \nCentral to our work is the history of three large tidal inlets which we consider have \nplayed a strong role in determining the morphological resilience of the Dungeness \nForeland.  When operating, these inlets were kept open by tidal flux which is a \nfunction of tidal range, wave climate and tidal prism (Bruun and Gerritsen, 1959).  \nStudies elsewhere show that tidal inlets enable the deposition of large volumes of \nsediment in back-barrier areas that can provide a platform against which a barrier can \nstabilise and over which it may then migrate (FitzGerald et al., 2002; Cleary and \nFitzGerald, 2003; Davis and Barnard, 2003).  Moreover, the shoreface sediment \nplatform is also an important precursor to the deposition of new beaches on \nprograding barriers such as Dungeness Foreland.  The location of tidal inlets relative \nto the barrier coastline is significant since it influences the input of sediment to the \ncoastal cell and, hence, the pattern of sediment processing.  This is particularly so for \ndrift-aligned barrier complexes. \n 4\n 134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n141 \n142 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n148 \n150 \n151 \n152 \nFig. 1.

To provide a broad-scale stratigraphic framework for the region by linking pre-140 \nexisting data from the back-barrier area with newly acquired data from the Rye \nand Romney inlets and the beach complex of Dungeness Foreland;  \n2. Using this framework, to reconstruct the depositional history of Dungeness 143 \nForeland, with particular attention paid to the role of the tidal inlets that \nformerly existed at Hythe, Romney and Rye as a controlling influence on barrier \nresilience; \n3. To explore the interdependence of the barrier, tidal inlet, and back-barrier 147 \nsediments, and;   \n4. To examine the natural and human influences that contribute to the 149 \nmorphological resilience of Dungeness Foreland, and to explore the implications \nof this research for existing models of barrier evolution.  \n \n 5\n2.

The main sources of \ngravel derive from offshore and the longshore movement of sediment released from \nthe erosion of the chalk cliffs and associated Pleistocene deposits (Long et al., 1996) \n(Fig. 1).  A platform of subtidal and intertidal deposits underlies much of Rye Bay, \nDungeness Foreland and the back-barrier marshes (Greensmith and Gutmanis, 1990; \nLong and Innes, 1995; Dix et al., 1998).   The deposition of the Rye Bay shelf sand \nbody (SSB) is explained by several factors (Dix et al., 1998).  First, the area is located \nat the downwind end of the English Channel, one of the stormiest seas in the U.K, and \nit therefore experiences the typically high energy wind\/wave conditions necessary for \nSSB deposition.  Second, SSB development is favoured by a steep (>1\u00b0) shoreface \n(Roy et al., 1994).  Outside the limits of Rye Bay, bedrock outcrops as an eroded \nplanar surface with a gradient typically <0.6\u00b0, whereas across Rye Bay bedrock \ngradients steepen from the exposed bedrock platform that outcrops in the intertidal \nzone beneath Fairlight Cliffs (Fig. 1).  Finally, following the early Holocene opening \nof the Strait of Dover, stratigraphic evidence and palaeotidal modelling (Austin, 1991) \nsuggests that the tidal range increased significantly and a strong nearshore easterly \nmovement of sand began towards the Strait of Dover (Long et al., 1996).   \n \nThe beach gravel of Dungeness Foreland mostly comprises cherty sandstones \nderived from the Upper Greensand, fine-grained sandstones from the Upper \nGreensand and various quartzites.  The gravel on the beach ridge crests are generally \nfiner than that in the lows, and grain size varies between c. 8 mm and 150 mm (Green, \n1968).  Beach ridge amplitude varies between c. 0.5 m and 2 m (Plater and Long, \n1995).     \n \nThe present tidal range at Dungeness is 6.7 m and the height of mean high \nwater spring tides at Dungeness Point is +4.03 m OD.  Relative sea-level (RSL) in \nthis region has generally risen during the Holocene (Fig. 2) (Waller and Long, 2003; \n 6\nLong et al., 2006).  The rate of rise was greatest before c. 5000 cal. yrs BP, typically \n>3 mm yr-1, after which there was a pronounced slow-down to <2 mm yr-1 as the \nglobal production of meltwater fell.  Trends from the late Holocene are difficult to \nestablish because most of the data from the last 4000 years have been lowered from \ntheir original elevation by sediment (including peat) compaction.  The exposed gravel \nat Dungeness Foreland covers c. 2160 ha, with a further 1150 ha of gravel lying \nburied beneath marsh sediments. \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n \n2.2  Previous work \n \n2.2.1 Dungeness Foreland \n \nA continuous barrier running from Fairlight towards Hythe has been an element of \nmost evolutionary models of Dungeness Foreland, including those dating from the \nnineteenth century (Elliott, 1847; Lewin, 1862; Drew, 1864; Burrows, 1884; Gulliver, \n1897).  However, these early models were largely speculative being based on scant \nstratigraphic evidence and no absolute dating.  Following a systematic mapping of the \nmorphology of the Dungeness beaches, Lewis (1932) and Lewis and Balchin (1940) \nassigned ages to individual shorelines based on cartographic and documentary \nevidence.  They suggested that the beach ridges near Broomhill Level (Fig. 1), which \nare the lowest that outcrop at the surface in the study area, accumulated in the pre-\nRoman period.  This suggestion has subsequently been confirmed by radiocarbon \ndates of c. 3500 cal. yrs BP from organic deposits that overlie the beaches (Tooley \nand Switsur, 1988; Plater et al., 2002).   \n \n 7\n 212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \nFig. 2.

The location map shows the transect locations. \n \nA series of deep boreholes in the region of the Dungeness nuclear power \nstation (Fig. 1) penetrate to bedrock (at -30 m to -35 m OD) and reveal a stratigraphic \nsequence indicating coastal emergence, with offshore and lower shoreface sands that \nare overlain by upper shoreface sands, surface gravel and storm beach gravels (Hey, \n 9\n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n258 \n259 \n1967; Greensmith and Gutmanis, 1990).  This sequence is partly repeated in a \nborehole from Holmstone Beach between Jury\u2019s Gap and Galloway\u2019s Lookout (Fig. \n1) (Plater et al., 2002).  Further evidence of a progradational shoreface that pre-dates \nbeach ridge deposition comes from an offshore seismic investigation which identified \na series of convex-upward reflectors indicative of a seaward-prograding shelf sand \nbody that provided the platform on which the foreland beaches accumulated (Dix et \nal., 1998, see above). At the nuclear power station site, Greensmith and Gutmanis \n(1990) dated detrital shell and other organic material to establish a minimum age of c. \n3100 cal. yrs BP for a sandy facies (beneath the 5 to 6 m thick surface gravels).  \nHowever, radiocarbon and OSL dates, detailed below in Section 5, indicate that the \nmain body of the extant surface gravel beaches here accumulated more recently, \nprobably in the last two thousand years.  \n \n2.2.2 Tidal inlet history \n \nPrevious research has described late Holocene tidal inlets at Hythe, New \nRomney and Rye (Fig. 1) (e.g. Green, 1968; Cunliffe, 1980, 1988; Green, 1988; \nEddison, 2000; Rippon, 2002).  The Hythe inlet, which is likely to have been an early \nconduit for the river Rother (or \u201cLimen\u201d), existed during the Roman period (Cunliffe, \n1980).  By the late Saxon period this inlet was much reduced in size and a breach had \ndeveloped at Romney, where a Medieval port prospered before sediment infilled the \nharbour in the 13th century AD.  The third inlet at Rye is widely believed to have \ndeveloped following a catastrophic breach of the barrier during storms in the 13th \ncentury AD.  This inlet and its associated harbours persisted until the 17th century AD \n(Eddison, 1998, 2000).    \n \n2.2.3 Romney and Walland Marshes \n \nLithostratigraphic investigations across Romney and Walland Marshes (Waller \net al., 1988; Long and Innes, 1995; Long et al., 1996, 1998; Spencer et al., 1998a, b) \ncorroborate a basic stratigraphic model proposed by Green (1968) who identified four \nstratigraphic units above bedrock: a lower sand, blue clay, main marsh peat and \nyounger alluvium (Fig. 3).  The lower sand accumulated from c. 7800 cal. yrs BP, \nwhen RSL rise was rapid and when the tidal range increased following the opening of \n 10\n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \nthe Strait of Dover (Long et al., 1996).  Diatoms and foraminifera demonstrate that the \nblue clay immediately beneath the peat accumulated under intertidal mudflat and \nsaltmarsh environments.  The peat is up to 6 m thick in the valleys on the western side \nof Walland Marsh and thins eastward - near Midley Church the peat is only c. 0.5 m \nthick (Long and Innes, 1993).  The basal and upper contacts of this unit rise in altitude \nin an easterly direction, suggesting that their deposition occurred as a back-barrier \ninlet infilled (Allen, 1996; Spencer et al., 1998a).  Radiocarbon dates from the base of \nthe peat show that it spread from the valleys in the west after c. 6000 cal. yrs BP and \nby c. 3000 cal. yrs BP was forming across Walland Marsh and abutting the western \nedge of Dungeness Foreland.  Peat is restricted to the northern edge of Romney Marsh \nproper with thick deposits of laminated sands and silts present across much of the \ncentral and southern part of the marsh (Long et al., 1998; Fig. 3). \n \nDates of between c. 3000 and c. 1700 cal. yrs BP have been obtained from the \ntop of the peat (Long et al., 1998; Waller et al., 1999).  The upper contact of the peat \nis almost always abrupt and locally shows signs of erosion.  In places, tidal creeks \nhave cut through the peat and removed it entirely.  The largest channel (historically \nreferred to as the \u201cWainway Channel\u201d) is recorded to the south of Moneypenny Farm \nand Little Cheyne Court (Figs. 1 and 3 (Transect 1)). Other smaller channels \n(typically several tens to hundreds of meters across) are common in central and \nsouthern parts of Walland Marsh, although they are much less frequent across the \nnorthern marshlands. \n \n3. Methodology \n \n The lithological data presented in this paper for the marshland sediments were \nmainly collected using a gouge corer, with sample cores for laboratory analysis \nretrieved using a percussion or \u201cRussian\u201d corer.  The deep boreholes that extend \nthrough the gravel of Dungeness Foreland, and which were used for the collection of \nsamples for OSL dating, were drilled using  \n 11\n290 \n291 \n292 \nTable 1.

All site elevations are reported in meters with respect to the U.K. Ordnance \nDatum (OD) which approximates mean sea-level.  The detailed methods and results of \nthe newly collected litho-, bio and chronostratigraphic data summarised in this paper \ncan be found in Roberts and Plater (2005), Schofield and Waller (2005), Long et al. \n(2006), Waller et al. (2006), Waller and Schofield (2006) and Stupples and Plater \n(submitted). \n \nThis paper uses a chronology based on a variety of data sources.  The \nradiocarbon dates (Table 1) are cited in calibrated years before present (cal. yrs BP), \nwhere BP is AD 1950.  Freshwater (terrestrial) samples are calibrated using the \nCALIB 5.0.1 programme (Reimer et al., 2004).  Marine samples are calibrated using \nthe Marine04 dataset with a local marine reservoir effect (\u2206R) for the English Channel \nof -32 \u00b1 56 yrs (Harkness, 1983).  The OSL dates were originally calculated in years \nbefore 2000 AD (Roberts and Plater, 2005), but here we adjust them to years before \nAD 1950 to allow direct comparison to the calibrated radiocarbon dates (Table 2).  \nFinally, historical dates are referred to in years AD. \n \n4. A new stratigraphic model for the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland \ndepositional complex \n \nIn this section we present a new stratigraphic model for the south coast of the \ndepositional complex that links the barrier and back-barrier sediments, including the \ntidal inlets that once existed at Romney and Rye (Fig. 4).  The transect is divided into \nseven sections.   \n \n 13\n4.1.

At Pewis Marsh, for example, highly humified peat \nfrom the upper contact has been dated to c. 3700 cal. yrs BP (Waller et al., 2006).  A \nthin slope-wash deposit that mantles the peat is dated to between c. 1700-2200 cal. yrs \nBP (Waller et al., 2006).  This provides a minimum age for the return  \n \nTable 2.

Peat formation was sustained for a much longer \nperiod in the central part of the Brede valley near West Winchelsea, where saltmarsh \ndeveloped on top of the peat only after c. 1300 cal. yrs BP (Long et al., 2006).  \nSeveral centuries after this initial inundation there was a rapid increase in water depth \nand tidal energy, probably associated with historically documented flooding in the \n13th century AD which resulted in the deposition of c. 4 m of tidally-laminated \nsediments before site reclamation by c. 1460 AD.   \n \n4.2.

We suspect that the peat once extended uninterrupted \nacross this area but has been eroded by the large tidal channels that developed here in \nthe Medieval period (the Rother, Wainway Channel and Brede channels).  A deep \nborehole that penetrated the late Holocene beaches at Castle Farm (Fig. 4) yielded \nthree OSL dates in age sequence and record sand accumulation from 890 \u00b1 70 yrs BP \nthrough to 560 \u00b1 30 yrs BP after which the surface gravel was deposited (Roberts and \nPlater, 2005).  The oldest of these dates corroborates the radiocarbon evidence from \nthe lower Brede (West Winchelsea) suggesting a tidal inlet in this area from at least \n1000 yrs BP, with sand accumulating on an intertidal or subtidal shoreface in front of \nthe contemporaneous shoreline.  \n \nThe transect extends across the former Wainway Channel, now infilled by a \ndeep sequence (from c. +2.5 m OD to at least to -3 m OD) of tidally laminated sands \nand silts with occasional pockets of eroded peat and broken shells.  The northern edge \nof this channel marks the limit of the erosion associated with the Rye inlet and is \nnotable for a surface outcrop of gravel which forms a series of small cuspate beaches \nin the Moneypenny Farm area (Fig. 4).  The conventional marshland sequence (see \nsection 2.2.3) occurs to the north of this gravel outcrop where the upper levels of the \npeat contain a layer rich in Sphagnum macrofossils indicating the development of a \nraised bog during the later stages of peat growth; dating evidence at Little Cheyne \nCourt suggests raised bog development after c. 2700 cal. yrs BP (Waller et al., 1999).  \nThe bog was inundated soon after c. 900 cal. yrs BP at East Guldeford and Little \nCheyne Court, and buried by marine\/brackish sediments that extend to the modern \nsurface.  In contrast, at Moneypenny Farm these post-peat sediments are overlain by \nsand and the surface outcrop of gravel. A sample of this sand yielded an OSL age of \n460 \u00b1 30 yrs BP (Roberts and Plater, 2005).   \n \n4.3. Little Cheyne Court to Jury\u2019s Gap (Fig. 4, Section 3)  \n \nInundation of the raised bog at Little Cheyne Court occurred as a result of \nflooding from the adjacent Wainway Channel.  This channel is c. 1000 m wide \nbetween Little Cheyne Court and Sandylands (Broomhill Level) (Green, 1968; Long \n 16\n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n407 \n408 \n409 \n410 \n411 \n412 \n413 \n414 \n415 \n416 \n417 \n418 \n419 \n420 \n421 \n422 \n423 \n424 \n425 \n426 \n427 \n428 \n429 \n430 \n431 \n432 \nand Innes, 1995).  Near to Little Cheyne Court, there is evidence for a marked up-core \nchange in channel stratigraphy, from coarse, saturated sands to finer-grained, well-\nlaminated sands and silts above c. -1 m OD (Fig. 4).  A single valve of the mollusc \nCerastoderma edule from the base of the laminated sand yielded a date of 655-925 \ncal. yrs BP (Evans et al., 2001).   \n \nBuried gravel of mid to late Holocene age occurs across much of Broomhill \nLevel (Fig. 4). OSL dates indicate the shoreface sands below this gravel were in place \nby c. 4700 yrs BP (Roberts and Plater, 2005).  Locally the gravel subcrop is overlain \nby a 0.5 m-thick organic deposit which, dating at Tishy\u2019s Sewer from c. 3200-3800 \ncal. yrs BP, provides a maximum age for gravel deposition (Tooley and Switsur, \n1988).  To the north-east, in the Scotney Marsh area (Fig. 1), peat abuts the western \nmargin of the gravel outcrop of Dungeness Foreland (Spencer, 1997; Spencer et al., \n1998a, b).  Radiocarbon dates indicate several phases of peat development here \nbetween c. 3800 and c. 1600 cal. yrs BP (Spencer and Woodland, 2002).  The clastic \nsediments overlying and intercalated with these peats suggest that tidal waters \npenetrated behind the gravel barrier from early as c. 3200 cal. yrs BP, with repeated \ntidal flooding until at least the late Roman period.  These tidal waters may have \npenetrated the barrier from the south coast of the foreland, or from a tidal inlet at \nHythe or Romney (see below).  A marine\/brackish influence in the Scotney Marsh \narea during the Roman period is supported by archaeological evidence for saltmaking \n(Barber, 1998).  \n  \n4.4.  Dungeness Foreland \u2013 Jury\u2019s Gap to Galloway\u2019s Lookout (Fig. 4, Section 4) \n \nThe gravel outcrop has a surface relief of +3 m to +4 m OD at Jury\u2019s Gap and \nrises in an easterly direction to c. +5 m OD on Holmstone Beach (Fig. 4).  OSL dates \nfrom the Midrips indicate that the shoreface sands below the SW-NE trending gravel \nridges here were in place soon after the equivalent deposits at Broomhill Level, c. \n4700 yrs BP (Roberts and Plater, 2005).  These older inner beach ridges extend NW \nbeyond Lydd and indicate an early period of drift-aligned sediment movement and \nbarrier extension towards Hythe. \n \n 17\n433 \n434 \n435 \n436 \n437 \n438 \n439 \n440 \n441 \n442 \n443 \n444 \n445 \n446 \n447 \n448 \n449 \n450 \n451 \n452 \n453 \n454 \n455 \n456 \n457 \n458 \n459 \n460 \n461 \n462 \n463 \n464 \n465 \n466 \n The rate of eastward barrier development appears to rise after c. 2000 yrs BP \n(Fig. 4), though this may equally reflect a shift in the axis of foreland progadation \n(Roberts and Plater, 2005).  Thus, OSL dates from Holmstone Beach, South Brooks \nand Lydd Beach all provide a similar minimum age for gravel deposition of c. 1900 \nBP.  Independent support for this chronology comes from a radiocarbon-dated plant \nmacrofossil at the base of Wickmaryholm Pit; a natural waterlogged depression on the \nforeland surface (Long and Hughes, 1995) (Fig. 4).   \n \n Several areas of marshland sediment interrupt the continuity of the gravel \nbeaches along the south coast of the foreland (e.g. the Midrips, Wicks and South \nBrooks).  Each is infilled with up to 4 m of sediment, typically comprising a lower \nlaminated sandy silt and an upper, mottled silt clay.  Diatoms from a core collected \nfrom South Brooks (Long and Hughes, 1995) demonstrate deposition occurred under \ntidal channel conditions, whilst the tidally-laminated sediments within these sites are \nindicative of sediment accretion rates of the order of 0.3 m yr-1 (Stupples and Plater, \nsubmitted).  Air photographs, as well as Green\u2019s (1968) soil map, show that some of \nthese tidal channels cross-cut older beaches and, therefore, post-date gravel \ndeposition.  The origin and, in particular, the age of these marsh sediments are \ndifficult to establish due to the lack of in situ carbonaceous material for dating.  \nEddison (1983) has observed ridge and furrow patterns in the Wicks, which are \ninterpreted as evidence for an \u201cearly phase\u201d of agriculture.  A \u201clater phase\u201d of more \nintense activity, perhaps associated with saltmaking, is suggested by a set of closely \nspaced rectangular ditches, on top of which is a sea wall that dates from the mid-13th \ncentury AD and which was part of an extensive set of walls across Walland Marsh \nbuilt in response to the threat of flooding at this time (Eddison, 1983; Eddison and \nDraper, 1997). \n \n4.5. Galloway\u2019s Lookout to Denge Marsh (Fig. 4, Section 5) \n \nThe gravel beaches rise further in elevation between the eastern edge of Lydd \nBeach at Galloway\u2019s Lookout and Muddymore Pit, with one set of beaches reaching a \nmaximum altitude of c. +6.5 m OD (Lewis and Balchin, 1940; Plater and Long, \n1995).   These high beaches lie to the west of Denge Marsh and several of them curve \nback on themselves to form a prominent beach that runs in an arc back along the line \n 18\n467 \n468 \n469 \n470 \n471 \nof the Dengemarsh Road and defines the eastern edge of the town of Lydd.  This \nbeach can be traced northwards as a thin finger of gravel that extends towards New \nRomney.  To the east and north of this beach are the fine-grained marsh sediments of \nDenge Marsh. \n \n 472 \n473 \n474 \n475 \n476 \n477 \n478 \nFig. 4. Stratigraphic transect along the south coast of the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex. Radiocarbon \ndates are cited in calibrated years before present (AD 1950) (cal. Yr BP) with a two sigma age range. Marine samples are \ncalibrated using the Calib Marine04 dataset with a local marine reservoir effect (\u0394R) for the English Channel of \u221232\u00b156 yr \n(Harkness, 1983). OSL ages are presented in full in Roberts and Plater (2005) and Roberts and Plater (in press), and are cited in \nyears before AD 1950 to enable comparison with the radiocarbon dates. \n \n 19\n 479 \n480 \n481 \n482 \n483 \n484 \n485 \n486 \n487 \n488 \n489 \n490 \n491 \n492 \n493 \n494 \n495 \n496 \n497 \nFig. 4 (continued) \n \nAn age of c. 1000 yrs BP for the prominent Dengemarsh Road beach is \nderived from several sources.  OSL dates from shoreface sands at Manor Farm \nsuggest a minimum age for the overlying gravel of 930 \u00b1 40 yrs BP (Fig. 4) (Roberts \nand Plater, 2005) and a radiocarbon date from the base of Muddymore Pit, provides a \nmaximum age for gravel deposition of 782-925 cal. yrs BP (Schofield and Waller, \n2005).  The age difference between Lydd Beach (c. 1900 yrs BP) and the Dengemarsh \nRoad beach implies a decline in the rate of foreland progradation.  However, this \nsimply reflects a change in the axis of progradation, as the intervening ridges were \nclearly deposited at the distal portion of the prograding foreland.  Together, these data \nsuggest that the foreland migrated rapidly in a north-easterly direction between c. \n1900 and 1000 yrs BP. \n \nShells of Cerastoderma edule from laminated sands and silts that overlie \ngravel at Manor Farm (Fig. 4) are radiocarbon dated to 1048-1306 cal. yrs BP (Plater \net al., 2002), whilst two dates on a whale skeleton found during gravel extraction to \nthe north at Cockles Bridge indicate marine sedimentation here at 914-1175 cal. yrs \n 20\n498 \n499 \n500 \n501 \n502 \n503 \n504 \n505 \n506 \n507 \n508 \n509 \n510 \n511 \n512 \n513 \n514 \n515 \n516 \n517 \n518 \n519 \n520 \n521 \n522 \n523 \n524 \n525 \n526 \n527 \n528 \n529 \n530 \n531 \nBP (Gardiner, 1998; Gardiner et al., 1999). Historical sources indicate that much of \nthe area was used for salt manufacture from c. 1000 AD onwards (Vollans, 1995).   \n \n4.6. Denge Marsh to Dungeness Point (Fig. 4, Section 6) \n \nEast of Muddymore Pit, the main transect continues across the gravel beaches \nto the nuclear power station and Dungeness Point itself, which marks the easternmost \nlimit of the complex.  Beach ridge elevations continue to rise to the present ness, \nwhere altitudes of between +6 m and +7 m OD are attained. OSL ages on the sub-\ngravel shoreface are indicative of rapid coastal progradation between 930 \u00b1 40 and \n630 \u00b1 30 yrs BP.  Historical data, summarised in Lewis and Balchin (1940), indicate \neastward progradation rates between 1617 AD and 1844 AD of at least 5.5 m yr-1, and \nup to 3.6 m yr-1 between 1844 AD and 1939 AD (Fig. 1).   \n \n4.7. Denge Marsh to Romney (Fig. 4, Section 7) \n \nNortheastward from Denge Marsh, OSL age data suggest rapid shoreface \nextension between 1310 \u00b1 70 and 400 \u00b1 20 yrs BP, with extension beyond \nDengemarsh Road probably commencing as recently as 930 \u00b1 40 yrs BP (Roberts and \nPlater, 2005).  These observations confirm the suggestion of Lewis (1932) for easterly \ngrowth of the foreland during the post-Roman era, switching to more northerly \naccretion from late Saxon times.  Indeed, the tightly recurved, short gravel beaches \neast of Denge Beach do not extend across Denge Marsh.  This indicates that at this \ntime the shoreface sand platform was not sufficiently developed to the north and \nnorth-east to enable continuous gravel barrier extension across the entire shore.  This \nphase of barrier progradation clearly occurred under a very different set of dynamic \ncontrols to the previous 4000 years (i.e. 5000-1000 cal. yrs BP). \n \n5. Palaeogeography of the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional \ncomplex \n \nIn the following sections we reconstruct the history of the Romney \nMarsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex. Particular emphasis is placed on \nthe evolution of the three tidal inlets (first at Hythe, then Romney and Rye) and their \n 21\n532 \n533 \n534 \n535 \n536 \n537 \n538 \n539 \n540 \n541 \n542 \n543 \n544 \n545 \n546 \n547 \n548 \n549 \n550 \n551 \n552 \n553 \n554 \n555 \n556 \n557 \ninfluence on barrier development.  The reconstructions allow us to explore the driving \nmechanisms responsible for the long-term resilience of Dungeness Foreland, as well \nas models of barrier evolution more generally. \n \n5.1.  The Hythe inlet (Fig. 5) \n \nGeomorphic and archaeological evidence demonstrate a tidal inlet persisted in \nthe north-eastern part of Romney Marsh proper during the late Holocene. Green \n(1968) attributed a large area of calcified soils in the area to this inlet.  Indeed, the \nposition of these deposits, stratigraphically above the peat along the northern edge of \nthe inlet, shows that an expansion in tidal inundation across former freshwater \nwetlands occurred during the late Holocene.  Radiocarbon dates of c. 3200 cal. yrs BP \n(RM18) and c. 2300 cal. yrs BP (RM7) from Romney Marsh proper (Fig. 1, Long et \nal., 1998) provide minimum ages for this inundation.  However, the upper peat contact \nin these cores and elsewhere across Romney Marsh is abrupt and we suspect the \ninundation occurred later, possibly in the Roman period given the charcoal and burnt \nsilt in the overlying sediment of RM18.  Certainly archaeological evidence for \nsaltmaking is abundant across large areas of Romney Marsh during the 1st and 2nd \ncenturies AD (Cunliffe, 1988; Reeves, 1995), reflecting a pattern that was widespread \nin other coastal lowland areas in the UK and elsewhere on North Sea coasts during the \nRoman period (e.g. Hall and Coles, 1994; Rippon, 1996; Bonnot-Courtois et al., 2002; \nBehre, 2004).  A third century AD Roman port known as Limana (below the fort now \nknown as Stutfall Castle, Fig. 5) existed close to Hythe, near to the mouth of a tidal \ninlet (Cunliffe, 1980), and Gardiner et al. (2001) believes that there may well have \nbeen an earlier fort here too, perhaps dating from as early as 130 AD.   \n \n 22\n 558 \n559 \n560 \n561 \n562 \n563 \n564 \n565 \n566 \n567 \n568 \n569 \n570 \n571 \n572 \n573 \n574 \n575 \n576 \n577 \nFig. 5. Palaeogeographical reconstruction of the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex when the Hythe inlet \nwas dominant (c. AD 300\u2013400). \n \nThere is little archaeological evidence for the occupation of Romney Marsh \nproper between the 2nd century AD and the Saxon period.  One hypothesis is that the \narea was inhospitable due to the marine flooding noted above increasing in intensity \nfor at least several centuries after 200 AD (Cunliffe, 1988; Reeves, 1995).  This could \nbe related to a period of increased storm magnitude and frequency and\/or a rise in \nRSL, with inundation accompanied by the localised erosion and subsequent \ncompaction of the peatlands. Green (1968) suggests that the western limit of thick, \nnear-surface peat, is close to a line that connects Lydd, Old Romney, Ivychurch and \nNewchurch (Fig. 1).  However, tidal inundation probably reached further west, across \nonto what is today eastern Walland Marsh via several major west-east aligned creeks \nthat are mapped by Green (1968) close to Brookland and Wheelsgate (creek numbers \n2 and 3, Fig. 5).  There is no evidence for a tidal inlet at either Romney or Rye prior to \nthe 7th century AD. \n \nIncreased occupation of Romney Marsh from the mid-Anglo-Saxon period \nonward suggests that tidal waters were retreating by this time as the Hythe inlet \n 23\n578 \n579 \n580 \n581 \n582 \n583 \n584 \n585 \n586 \n587 \n588 \n589 \n590 \n591 \n592 \n593 \n594 \n595 \n596 \n597 \n598 \n599 \n600 \n601 \n602 \n603 \n604 \n605 \n606 \n607 \n608 \n609 \n610 \n611 \ninfilled. Thus, Reeves (1995) records pottery dating from the 8th to the 10th century \nAD across much of Romney Marsh proper, indicating that reclamation and land \nsettlement were well advanced by this time. Gardiner et al. (2001) track the infilling \nand closure of the Hythe inlet during this interval caused by the northward extension \nof sand and gravel beaches close to Sandtun; a port located on a sand spit close to \nHythe.  Two occupation layers here are dated to 690-775 AD and up to c. 840 AD, \nafter which the site was sealed by blown sand. The closure of the Hythe inlet probably \nreflected a combination of a reduction in tidal prism (itself possibly associated a \nchange in the outfall of the River Rother) and the northward drift of sand and gravel \nbeaches from the Lydd-Dymchurch area. Aeolian deposition may also have been \nimportant and suggests an abundance of shoreface sand at this time. \n \n5.2.  The Romney inlet (Fig. 6) \n \nHistorical documents refer to the existence of Romney (or \u201cRumensea\u201d), a \nport that stood on the shores of a tidal inlet, from at least AD 741 (Brooks, 1988; \nEddison, 2000).  This indicates that the east coast barrier was breached at broadly the \nsame time (if not before) as the Hythe inlet was closing.  We suspect that the two \nevents may have been linked, and that the Romney breach resulted from \ncannibalisation of the proximal part of the spit complex.  Such a process is an inherent \ntendency of drift-aligned barriers and would have been encouraged by increased \nnorthward drift of sediment towards Hythe. A second possibility is that a tidal channel \nthat flowed along the inside of the Lydd to Hythe beaches, possibly Green\u2019s (1968) \ncreek 1 (Fig. 5), weakened the barrier in the Romney area and promoted breaching. \n \nIt is not easy to reconstruct the former geometry of the newly established \nRomney inlet and the size of the associated back-barrier tidal prism (Fig. 6).  Today, \nmuch of the inner part of the inlet is infilled with mounds of sand and silt, some \nthought to be associated with Medieval salt making (Vollans, 1995).  However, the \nabsence of the tidal flooding of Romney Marsh proper at this time suggests that a \n\u201cprobable\u201d sea wall (Green, 1968) that can be traced in a westerly direction from New \nRomney, acted as a northerly boundary to this inlet (Fig. 6).  This wall can be tracked \nfurther inland as the Rumensea Wall, which, according to Allen (1996, 1999), was a \nmajor sea defence that separated Walland from Romney Marsh proper from as early \n 24\n612 \n613 \n614 \n615 \n616 \nas perhaps 700 AD.  The Rumensea Wall extends nearly all the way to the upland \nnear Appledore, suggesting that it was built after the development of the Romney inlet \nand was designed to protect the economically important regions of Romney Marsh \nproper from flooding along its entire length.  \n \n 617 \n618 \n619 \n620 \n621 \n622 \n623 \n624 \n625 \n626 \n627 \n628 \n629 \n630 \n631 \n632 \n633 \nFig. 6. Palaeogeographical reconstruction of the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex when the Romney \ninlet was dominant (c. AD 700\u2013800). \n \nThe Rumensea Wall was constructed on the east bank of a small creek (the \nRumensea). A second more substantial creek that appears to be associated with the \nRomney inlet can be identified to the south of Brookland in the stratigraphic transect \nof Long and Innes (1995) (Fig. 3, Transect 1). This channel is infilled with thick \ndeposits of laminated sands and silts.  It cuts across the main marsh peat which \nappears to been totally removed by erosion.  Spencer et al. (2002) record similar tidal \nchannel deposits, also incised through the peat, to the northwest of Midley Church.  \nThe distribution of the Brookland and Midley channel deposits closely matches a \nswath of Snargate-Finn soils mapped by Green (1968) that extend in a loop from close \nto Snargate, around Brookland and then south towards Cheyne Court. Compared to \nthe Rumensea, this channel, termed here the \u201cCheyne Channel\u201d, appears to be a much \nlarger and wider (c. 1.2 km) feature and, therefore, one of considerably more \nsignificance to the Medieval landscape of Walland Marsh.  Whether this provided a \n 25\n634 \n635 \n636 \n637 \n638 \n639 \n640 \n641 \n642 \n643 \n644 \n645 \n646 \n647 \n648 \n649 \n650 \n651 \n652 \n653 \n654 \n655 \n656 \n657 \n658 \n659 \n660 \n661 \n662 \n663 \n664 \n665 \n666 \n667 \nroute for the river Rother south across Walland Marsh to Romney and thus the \nEnglish Channel is not yet certain, although it must be considered likely.   \n \nThe extent of flooding of Walland Marsh appears initially to have been limited \nby the presence of the raised bog.  Indeed, the Cheyne Court area (immediately west \nof the Cheyne Channel) was not flooded until at least c. 900 AD, suggesting that it \nmust have stood above the tidal waters for at least 200 years after the Romney breach. \nThe soil survey map (Green, 1968) shows that the Cheyne Channel was confined \nbetween two major sets of embankments which were evidently constructed to limit \nflooding, both eastwards towards the Rumensea Wall and also to the southwest across \nWalland Marsh.  \n \nAfter about 1000 AD, the back-barrier area of the Romney inlet, including the \nCheyne Channel, began to infill and the tidal prism fell.  This process was greatly \nenhanced by reclamation from at least the 11th century AD onwards, if not before \n(Eddison and Draper, 1997).  Much of Romney Marsh proper was densely populated \nat this time, the pressure to acquire new land was high, and the intertidal expanses \nassociated with the Romney inlet must have been a prime target for reclamation.  A \nreduction in size of the Romney tidal prism would have had several consequences.  \nThe first, as observed on the German and Belgium coasts during the Medieval period \n(Behre, 2004; Meier, 2004), is to cause a reduction in the area available for \naccommodating storm waters.  This would have increased the likelihood of \ncatastrophic coastal inundation during storms, especially when combined with \ncompaction and lowering of the reclaimed and drained land behind the sea walls.  A \nsecond consequence would have been to reduce the cross-sectional area of the tidal \ninlet and promote sediment infilling of the breach.  Tidal inlet reduction can cause a \ndecrease in the size of the ebb-tidal delta and the onshore migration of large swash \nbars, as noted by FitzGerald et al. (2002) at Chatham Harbor Inlet (Cape Cod, U.S.A).   \nThis appears to have occurred as the Romney inlet infilled, with the development of a \nwide intertidal platform of sands and silts providing the foundation on top of which \nDungeness Foreland could prograde.  \n \nThere is abundant historical and geomorphological evidence that these \nprocesses were accelerating from the 11th century AD onwards.  The progressive \n 26\n668 \n669 \n670 \n671 \n672 \n673 \n674 \n675 \n676 \n677 \n678 \n679 \n680 \n681 \n682 \n683 \n684 \n685 \n686 \n687 \n688 \n689 \n690 \n691 \n692 \n693 \n694 \n695 \n696 \n697 \n698 \n699 \n700 \n701 \ninfilling of the tidal inlet was aided by silting of the back-barrier area and tidal inlets \nacross Walland Marsh, including parts of Denge Marsh and Belgar (Fig. 6).   This \nprocess continued despite the construction of the Rhee Wall; an artificial watercourse \nthat parallels the Rumensea Wall that was built in a failed attempt to flush out the \nharbour during the 13th century AD with tidal water which by this time extended \nnorthwards from the Rye area along the western edge of Walland Marsh to Appledore \n(Vollans, 1988; Green, 1988; Eddison, 2002).  \n \n5.3.  The Rye inlet (Fig. 6) \n \n            Historical evidence demonstrates the presence of a major tidal inlet at Rye in \nthe 13th century AD (Green, 1968; Eddison, 1998).  However, it is now clear that a \nbreach in the barrier occurred here from c. 700 AD, at which time the Romney and \nRye inlets may have been joined (Fig. 6).  Evidence for this early breach is provided \nby the radiocarbon dates (c. 1300 cal. yrs BP) for the end of peat formation at West \nWinchelsea and the development of saltmarsh environments here and at East \nGuldeford shortly after. A breach near Rye would have caused a substantial reduction \nin the longshore drift of sediment across Rye Bay and the reworking of down-drift \nportions of the foreland along the south coast (i.e. to the east of the breach). The \nmarked change in beach ridge orientation and distal extent in the beach ridges east of \nGalloway\u2019s Lookout suggest rapid north-eastward progradation of the ness at this \ntime.  With both tidal inlets open, tidal waters initially extended across the upstanding \npeatlands of southern Walland Marsh, including the margins of the raised bog.  \nHowever, as noted above, reclamation of northeastern Walland Marsh, notably the \narea between the Cheyne Channel and the Rumensea Wall, caused the size of the \nRomney inlet to fall.  It appears that simultaneously the Rye inlet expanded until it \ncame to dominate the back-barrier area of Walland Marsh, west of the large walls (or \n\u201cGreat Cordon\u201d (Eddison and Draper, 1997) that delimit the western margin of the \nCheyne Channel.  The contraction of the Romney inlet was greatly facilitated by the \nconstruction of a set of embankments from the Cheyne Channel to Midley and thence \nonto the gravel beaches at Lydd.  A pronounced west to east fall in ground surface \nelevation across these embankments, of between c. 1 m to 2 m (Long and Innes, 1995; \nSpencer, 1997), confirms the relative timing of these changes in inlet dimensions.   \n  \n 27\n702 \n703 \n704 \n705 \n706 \n707 \n708 \n709 \n710 \n711 \n712 \n713 \n714 \n715 \n716 \n717 \n718 \n719 \n720 \n721 \n722 \n723 \n724 \n725 \n726 \n727 \n728 \n729 \n730 \n731 \n732 \n733 \n734 \nReclamation of the remaining intertidal areas of Walland Marsh continued \nuntil at least 1234 AD (Eddison, 1998), but from the middle of the 13th century AD \nonwards there is growing reference in historical documents to the construction (or \nstrengthening) of sea defences across Walland Marsh to protect land from flooding \nfrom the Rye inlet, as opposed to new land claim (Eddison, 1998).  This switch to a \nmore defensive mode of land management records the start of a period of renewed \nflooding of the back-barrier area which was aggravated by the major storms of the \nmiddle and later 13th century AD.   \n \nOur reconstruction indicates that the 13th century AD storms enlarged a pre-\nexisting early tidal inlet at Rye.  An indication of the dimensions of the breach can be \nestimated from the distribution of peat, which has been eroded from a 4 km wide \ncorridor in the Rye area (Long et al., 2006).  A gravel outcrop along the northern \nshore of the Wainway Channel at Moneypenny Farm (Section  5.2) is derived from \nmaterial pushed northward during this breach and subsequently redistributed by \nlittoral drift down the Rother estuary and into the Wainway Channel, with the \nrecurves which mark its eastward limit forming as late as c. 500 yrs BP (Section 4.2).  \nHowever, there is no evidence in the stratigraphy around Rye for further substantial \ndeposits of gravel inland of this inlet (Long et al., 1996).  This suggests that the gravel \ncomponent of the Rye barrier was already of limited volume by the 13th century AD.  \nElsewhere, the widening of the Rye breach allowed tidal waters to inundate much of \nWalland Marsh, extending as far east as the \u201cGreat Cordon\u201d (Fig. 7).  This flooding \nresulted in a final inundation and rapid burial by collapse of the remaining areas of \nraised bog on Walland Marsh, as well as extensive areas of peat in the valleys to the \nwest of the study area (Long et al., 2006). \n  \nThe widening of the Rye inlet allowed the town to develop as one of the most \nimportant ports in southern England. However, its prosperity was short-lived since \nrenewed land claim after the thirteenth century storms once again rapidly diminished \nthe back-barrier tidal prism (Gardiner, 2002). Gravel began to accumulate again both \nsides of the breach from about 1400-1600 AD.  By this time the inlet was sufficiently \nfull of sediment (mostly sands and silts) to provide a platform on which the gravel \nbeaches of Rye Harbour could develop (Fig. 7).   This marked the final stages in the \n 28\n735 \n736 \n737 \n738 \n739 \n740 \n741 \n742 \n743 \n744 \n745 \n746 \n747 \n748 \n749 \n750 \n751 \n752 \n753 \n754 \n755 \n756 \n757 \n758 \n759 \n760 \n761 \n762 \n763 \n764 \n765 \n766 \n767 \nhistory of the Rye inlet, which from this point onwards became a narrow tidal channel \nwith only limited anchorage inland.  \n \n6. Discussion \n \nThe Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex has displayed \na remarkable morphological resilience over the last 4000 years, responding to changes \nin RSL, sediment supply, storms, and two major breaches associated with widespread \nback-barrier flooding.  What, then, are the factors that contributed to this resilience \nand what are the implications of our work for a wider understanding of mixed sand \nand gravel barrier dynamics? \n \n6.1 Sediment supply and transport \n \nAn abundant sediment supply has clearly been critical, both from external \nsources and also from internal reworking.  Smaller mixed sand and gravel barriers on \nparaglacial coasts generally complete a life-cycle in a matter of a few centuries or \nmillennia, their geologically ephemeral existence dictated by a finite supply of \nsediment released by localised erosion of cliff material (e.g. Orford et al., 1991; \nForbes et al., 1995).  Once the source of material has been exhausted, barriers switch \ninto a breakdown phase associated with up-drift cannibalisation followed by \nbreaching and structural re-organisation.  In contrast to these smaller-scale structures, \nthe large barrier system of Dungeness Foreland has a geomorphological persistence \nthat is quantified in thousands of years.  \n \nExternal sediment supplies to Dungeness Foreland include episodic longshore \ndelivery of sediment from the regional Selsey Bill \u2013 Dungeness coastal cell, as well as \noffshore sources from the floor of the English Channel.  The former will have been \nprevalent during periods of high storm incidence when headland by-passing was \npossible, and\/or when the tidal inlets along the Sussex coast were closed, thereby \nfacilitating the easterly movement of sediment to the Dungeness depocentre (Jennings \nand Smyth, 1990; Nichols, 1991).  The latter is not thought to be a significant \ncontributor during the late Holocene and, as demonstrated by a seismic survey of Rye \n 29\n768 \n769 \n770 \nBay, the majority of offshore sediment at or below wave-base is sand and not gravel \n(Dix et al., 1998). \n \n 771 \n772 \n773 \n774 \n775 \n776 \n777 \n778 \n779 \n780 \n781 \n782 \n783 \n784 \n785 \n786 \n787 \nFig. 7. Palaeogeographical reconstruction of the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex when the Rye inlet \nwas dominant (c. AD 1400). \n \nDungeness Foreland has been periodically nourished by locally available \nsediment released through cannibalisation of the updrift portions of the barrier, which \nwere presumably once more extensive in Rye Bay than present based on the \norientation of extant beaches along the foreland\u2019s south coast.  This process is similar \nto that described in other case studies from North America (e.g. Forbes et al., 1995) \nand Argentina (Isla and Bujalesky, 2000).  Drift-aligned barriers are especially \nsensitive to reductions in sediment supply with up-drift reworking leading to the \ncreation of distinct erosion\/accretion cells.  Cell fragmentation may eventually lead to \nbreaching and tidal inlet formation, such as occurred at Romney and at Rye.  Carter \nand Orford (1991) note that localised protuberances of sediment may develop at \ndowndrift locations in these cells, and such a process appears to explain some of the \nabrupt changes in beach ridge orientation and extension observed on the south coast \nof Dungeness Foreland, east of Galloway\u2019s Lookout (Fig. 1).  These changes in beach \n 30\n788 \n789 \n790 \n791 \n792 \n793 \n794 \n795 \n796 \n797 \n798 \n799 \n800 \n801 \n802 \n803 \n804 \n805 \n806 \n807 \n808 \n809 \n810 \n811 \n812 \n813 \n814 \n815 \n816 \n817 \n818 \n819 \n820 \n821 \nridge morphology date from around the time of the establishment of the Rye inlet and \nprobably record accumulation of sediment at the downdrift end of a newly formed \nRye \u2013 Dungeness sediment cell.   \n \nThe history of Dungeness Foreland is essentially one of fragmentation; an \ninitial single drift-aligned structure that extended across much of the study area \ndeveloped into a succession of smaller cells characterised by accretion and erosion \nassociated with the opening and closing of different tidal inlets.  In this sense, the term \n\u201ccoastal resilience\u201d means little without a clearly defined spatial and temporal \nframework.  At a landform scale, Dungeness Foreland has demonstrated remarkable \nmorphological resilience.  But at small spatial scales and shorter temporal intervals, \nbarrier inlet dynamics have been associated with the repeated creation and destruction \nof individual beaches and complexes of beaches.  The landform demonstrates multiple \nscales of \u201cresilience\u201d that operated simultaneously across the complex in response to \ndifferent forcing agents of different magnitudes and frequencies.  These issues of \nscale are relevant when considering the application of Orford et al.\u2019s (1991) three \nphase model of barrier initiation, stability and breakdown to large sand and gravel \nbarriers such as Dungeness.  In particular, it is helpful to reflect further on the \ninteractions between sediment supply, sediment transport and nearshore bathymetry \nand accommodation space.   \n \nFor drift-aligned structures, multiple modes of barrier behaviour arise from the \ninterplay between sediment supply, nearshore bathymetry, accommodation space and \nwave climate (e.g. Cooper and Navas, 2004).  During the early and mid Holocene, the \nRye Bay bathymetry was relatively deep and the area would have been a sediment \nsink (Dix et al., 1998).  However, by the post-Roman period the bay had shallowed \nand infilled.  From this time onwards, the down-drift export of upper-shoreface gravel \nincreased and Rye Bay developed a sediment deficit.  This process caused the Rye \nBay barrier to erode and made it increasingly vulnerable to overtopping, overwashing \nand eventual breaching.  Once breached, new deep water conditions developed in the \nbreach vicinity and sediment accumulation and the process of barrier healing began. \nThus, as the Rye Bay completed a cycle of initiation, stability, breakdown and \nreformation, so the down-drift part of Dungeness Foreland grew and contracted in \nharmony.   \n 31\n822 \n823 \n824 \n825 \n826 \n827 \n828 \n829 \n830 \n831 \n832 \n833 \n834 \n835 \n836 \n837 \n838 \n839 \n840 \n841 \n842 \n843 \n844 \n845 \n846 \n847 \n848 \n849 \n850 \n851 \n852 \n853 \n854 \n855 \n \n6.2 Relative sea-level change \n \n The Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex is located in a \nregion of the northwest Europe that is experiencing gradual, long-term crustal \nsubsidence as a result of on-going glacio-isostatic adjustment following the \ndeglaciation of the British and Fennoscandanavian ice sheets.  As a result, the trend in \nRSL throughout the Holocene has been upwards although, as is apparent from Fig. 2., \nthe rate of RSL has changed quite significantly.  Regrettably, the quality of the RSL \nobservations from the study area is not high, due to the contaminating effects of \nsediment compaction.  Nevertheless, the abrupt slow-down in the rate of RSL at c. \n4000-5000 cal. yrs BP is a regional feature observed elsewhere in southern England \n(Waller and Long, 2003) and it is noteworthy that this period of time coincides with \nthe earliest dates that are presented in this paper for the deposition of the gravel \nbeaches across Broomhill Level (Section 4.3 above).  Indeed, Jennings and Smyth \n(1990) have previously argued that this pronounced slow-down in mid Holocene RSL \nfacilitated the onshore transfer of sediment to form gravel barriers along the Sussex \ncoast under a strongly dissipative nearshore regime.  The altitude of the Dungeness \nbeach ridges rise through time, from c. +1 m OD on Broomhill Level to c. +6 to +7 m \nOD on Denge Beach and the current eastern shore of the complex (Fig. 4).  Some of \nthis increase may be explained by changes in beach ridge orientation, sediment \nsupply, as well as storminess (Plater and Long, 1995), but based on the trends in Fig. \n2, at least 3 m or so of this increase must record the millennial-scale rise in RSL from \nthe mid Holocene to present.  These observations indicate that conditions for the \ndevelopment of the foreland probably originated in response to the mid Holocene \nslow-down in RSL, but that the foreland has continued to grow over millennial \ntimescales, regardless of a continuing upwards trend in long-term RSL.    \n \n A more challenging question is to determine whether the reslience of the \nforeland has been affected over shorter timescales by high frequency variations in \nRSL and, in particular, variations in storminess.  During the late Holocene, our \nreconstruction identifies two time periods of particular importance to the history of \nthe Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland depositional complex; the first around c. \n2000 cal. yrs BP and the second at c. 700 AD.  Changes in barrier behaviour at these \n 32\n856 \n857 \n858 \n859 \n860 \n861 \n862 \n863 \n864 \n865 \n866 \n867 \n868 \n869 \n870 \n871 \n872 \n873 \n874 \n875 \n876 \n877 \n878 \n879 \n880 \n881 \n882 \n883 \n884 \n885 \n886 \n887 \n888 \n889 \ntimes had far-reaching and inter-connected consequences for the foreland and the \nback-barrier areas. Although there is little evidence for a period of enhanced storms \nduring the Roman period, studies elsewhere suggest an increase in dune formation \n(e.g. Tooley, 1990; Orford et al., 2000) during the Medieval Warm Period, when the \nRye and Romney inlets developed.  However, the latter provide, at best, loose \nchronological correlatives to the c. 1300 cal. yrs BP breaches at Romney and Rye, and \nthe dating evidence is currently too weak to invoke enhanced storminess as a common \ncause for their development.   \n \nThe evidence for tidal inundation of Romney and Walland Marshes during the \nRoman period is matched elsewhere in the UK and the southern North Sea basin.  In \nthe Severn Estuary, for example, coastal flooding is well documented on the Somerset \nLevels, the Avon Levels, as well as the Gwent Levels (Godwin, 1943; Rippon, 1997).  \nIn North Germany, Behre (2004) describes how in the 1st century AD coastal \ndwellings were abandoned and the remaining inhabitants protected themselves by \nconstructing their houses on raised mounds known as Wurten.  Many of the coastal \ndwelling sites in Lower Saxony were abandoned by the 3rd century AD, probably due \nto coastal flooding (Mier, 2004).  Such a regional trend suggests RSL rise and \nassociated erosion at this time was a likely contributory factor to inundation and \nabandonment.  It is probable that there was a significant anthropogenic component to \nthese inundations, with land claim likely to have significantly increased flood levels. \n \n6.3 Barrier and back-barrier interactions \n \nIn addition to abundant sediment supply, barrier resilience is promoted by the \nclose interaction between the barrier and the back-barrier.  This is well-illustrated by \nthe repeated ability of the tidal inlets to narrow and then close, effectively healing the \noriginal breach via back-barrier sedimentation and ebb- and\/or flood-tidal delta \ndevelopment.  For example, during the Medieval period, when the Romney and Rye \ninlets were simultaneously open, the foreland became an island.  Back-barrier infilling \nand tidal inlet closure ensured that the landform reformed into a single structure \nrelatively quickly, probably within a few hundred years. However, only with the \nHythe inlet does the process of inlet closure appear to have been an entirely natural \nprocess (although Reeves (1995) suggests even here there was a human-dimension); \n 33\n890 \n891 \n892 \n893 \n894 \n895 \n896 \n897 \n898 \n899 \n900 \n901 \n902 \n903 \n904 \n905 \n906 \n907 \n908 \n909 \n910 \n911 \n912 \n913 \n914 \n915 \n916 \n917 \n918 \n919 \n920 \n921 \n922 \n923 \ninlet closure\/contraction at Romney and Rye were strongly influenced by reductions \nin tidal prism due to aggressive reclamation and by artificial maintenance of the tidal \nRother as a navigable channel. \n \n6.4 Implications for the management of sand and gravel barriers \n \nThese observations on self-organisation have implications for coastal \nmanagement strategies.  Firstly, it is clear that drift-aligned sand and gravel barriers \nare dynamic landforms at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.  Any attempt to \nrestrict this dynamism ignores the fact that this is an inherent element of the long-term \nresilience of these landforms.  Secondly, the Rye-Dungeness barrier system has a \nparticular response to reduced sediment supply \u2013 it breaches.  These breaches, at \nRomney and Rye, interrupted the efficient drift-cell export of sediment which would \nclearly have been unsustainable in the long-term.  Each was followed by re-sealing as \ncell fragmentation and deeper nearshore waters prompted renewed sediment \naccumulation.  This tendency to breach under periods of sediment stress could \npotentially be used to the long-term future benefit of the landform.   \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nWe have proposed a new stratigraphic model for the Dungeness \nForeland\/Romney Marsh depositional complex based on a detailed review of a wide \nrange of data. An early drift-aligned structure that extended uninterrupted from \nFairlight towards Hythe, is envisaged in line with previous reconstructions.  This \nbarrier was in place by c. 5000 to 4000 cal. yrs BP.  For the next 2000 to 3000 years, \nthe barrier remained a largely stable form, building relatively slowly to the east, \nincreasingly nourished with sediment cannibalised from up-drift sources in Rye Bay.   \n \nMarine conditions returned across Romney Marsh proper after c. 2000 cal. yrs \nBP, penetrating across parts of Walland Marsh.  The phases of tidal flooding have not \nbeen conclusively dated, but one may correlate with the marine inundation that is \nrecorded in many coastal lowlands in the UK and the southern North Sea basin during \nthe Roman period.  Between c. 700-1700 AD, the evolution of Dungeness Foreland \nwas closely linked to the opening and subsequent contraction\/closure of tidal inlets at \n 34\n924 \n925 \n926 \n927 \n928 \n929 \n930 \n931 \n932 \n933 \n934 \n935 \n936 \n937 \n938 \n939 \n940 \n941 \n942 \n943 \n944 \n945 \n946 \n947 \n948 \n949 \n950 \n951 \n952 \n953 \n954 \n955 \n956 \n957 \nRomney and Rye.  For a period of time, perhaps lasting a few hundred years, we \nbelieve that the two inlets operated simultaneously and that Dungeness Foreland \nbecame an island.  Closure of the Romney inlet was aided by extensive reclamation \nthat reduced the back-barrier tidal prism and probably also diminished the size of the \nRomney (and Rye) ebb-tidal delta.  An initially small inlet at Rye was significantly \nwidened in the 13th century AD by a period of intense storms.  There followed a \nrelatively brief interval of renewed flooding across Walland Marsh, and then a more \nprotracted infilling of the main tidal channels \u2013 the Wainway, Rother and Brede.  \nRenewed reclamation accelerated tidal prism reduction and inlet closure, with \nsignificant infilling occurring after c. 1500 AD by sand and gravel derived from up-\ndrift sources.   \n \nOur work highlights that resilient coasts are not necessarily stable coasts.  \nCertainly, with respect to our study area, much of the Dungeness resilience can be \nattributed to the sheer size of the depositional complex that includes the foreland and \nthe back-barrier marshland.   Their co-dependence demonstrates that current \nmanagement schemes that preclude the possibility of significant cross-barrier \nsediment and water exchange are at odds with the longer-term dynamic resilience of \nthis landform.  Indeed, the large height difference between the barrier and back-\nbarrier areas, and the extensive use of hard defences along Pett Level, at Broomhill, \nand also Dymchurch (Robinson, 1988), combine to create a coastal landform that has \nlittle capacity for internal readjustment in response to future changes in RSL, storms \nand sediment supply without radical readjustment of its boundary conditions.  Thus, \nthe Holocene record demonstrates that the Romney Marsh\/Dungeness Foreland \ndepositional complex retains significant potential for coastal resilience but that, as \nwith many managed coastal lowlands in the developed world, this will only be \nrealised if the constraints of \u2018hard\u2019 engineered coastal protection measures are \nloosened and \u2018soft\u2019 engineering solutions are considered on spatial and temporal \nscales more attuned to inherent (and previously demonstrated) resilience \ncharacteristics.   \n \n Large mixed sand and gravel barriers like Dungeness Foreland are inherently \nresilient landforms capable of internal recycling of sediment to maintain overall \nlandform integrity.  We identify multiple spatial and temporal scales of morphological \n 35\n958 \n959 \n960 \n961 \n962 \n963 \n964 \n965 \n966 \n967 \n968 \n969 \n970 \n971 \n972 \n973 \n974 \n975 \n976 \n977 \n978 \n979 \n980 \n981 \n982 \n983 \n984 \n985 \n986 \n987 \n988 \n989 \n990 \n991 \nresilience, often with different elements of the same landform experiencing \nsynchronous phases of erosion, stability or accretion.  The repeated development of \ntidal inlets facilitates cross-barrier exchange of water and sediment, but these inlets \nalso disrupt any tendency toward landform self-destruction that is inevitable in an \nefficient drift-dominated system that experiences sediment depletion.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis work was completed with the support of two grants from English Heritage under \nthe Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund as well as support from the Romney Marsh \nResearch Trust and the Colyer-Fergusson Charitable Trust.
