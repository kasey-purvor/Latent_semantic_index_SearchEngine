INTRODUCTION 74 \n 75 \nAnthropogenic emissions of SO2 have risen since 1850 due to increased industrial 76 \nactivity (LeFohn et al., 1999), rendering atmospheric sulphate aerosols key agents in 77 \nforcing recent climate (e.g. Smith et al., 2001). Such increased emissions are 78 \ndocumented in ice core records of sulphate deposition, which are currently considered 79 \nthe premier archive of past atmospheric sulphur concentrations (e.g., Patris et al., 80 \n2000, 2002; Isaakson et al., 2005). However, ice core localities are frequently distal 81 \nfrom sources of SO2 emissions and reflect a relatively clean atmospheric boundary 82 \nlayer. Due to the relatively short lifetime of sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, the 83 \nimpact of anthropogenic sulphur emissions on the climate and biogeochemistry of 84 \nsulphur cycling is most acute at local and regional scales. Historical quantification of 85 \nsulphur inputs to terrestrial environments has been demonstrated through sulphur 86 \nisotope ratios in archived soil and herbage samples from the UK (Zhao et al., 1998), 87 \nfrom wood of coniferous trees in Japan (Kawamura et al., 2006) and from lake and 88 \npeat sediment cores in Europe (Bottrell and Coulson, 2003; Coulson et al., 2005; 89 \nNovak et al., 2005) and Canada (Mayer et al., 2007). 90 \n 91 \nSpeleothems can yield multi-proxy, high resolution records of the palaeoenvironment, 92 \nand are formed through the carbonation of host carbonate bedrocks and re-93 \nprecipitation of calcite within cave environments (see review by Fairchild et al., 94 \n2006a). The incorporation of trace elements, organic molecules and specific stable 95 \nisotope signatures in speleothem carbonate provides a suite of geochemical 96 \nparameters capable of capturing a cave\u2019s response to the external environment. Thus, 97 \ntrace amounts of sulphur discovered as sulphate in speleothems suggest that 98 \nstalagmites may record key aspects of atmospheric variability in sulphate content at 99 \nlocal and regional scales (Frisia et al., 2005; Fairchild et al., 2006a). Sulphate is 100 \ninferred to be present in speleothem calcite as Carbonate Associated Sulphate (CAS) 101 \nidentified in the geological record of marine carbonates (e.g. Bottrell and Newton, 102 \n2006). XANES analysis has been used in both marine (Pingitore et al., 1995) and 103 \nspeleothem carbonate (Frisia et al., 2005) to identify the oxidation state of the 104 \nconstituent sulphur as sulphate, implying its presence within the calcite lattice as a 105 \nstructural substitution for carbonate. However, sulphur concentration data alone 106 \ncannot directly identify the source of speleothem CAS (Wadleigh et al., 1996; Frisia 107 \net al., 2005). Atmospheric variability in sulphate content is controlled by natural as 108 \nwell as anthropogenic sources of sulphur and may be modified by biogeochemical 109 \ncycling and additional sources of sulphur stored within the surrounding bedrock and 110 \nsoil waters (Figure 1). The sulphate content of cave drip waters and associated 111 \nstalagmites may thus represent a mixed signal, reflecting not only the local variability 112 \nin atmospheric sulphate content, but also biogeochemical cycling in the ecosystem 113 \nabove the cave. Sulphur and oxygen isotope systematics of sulphate differ markedly, 114 \nand in principle should enable the provenance of sulphate within speleothems to be 115 \nestablished permitting further deconvolution of the mixed atmospheric \/ 116 \nbiogeochemical signal archived within speleothems.  117 \n 118 \n2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 119 \n 120 \nFigure 1 summarises the potential sources of sulphate contributing to speleothem 121 \nCAS with characteristic \u03b434S compositions. Primary sea-salt aerosols released into the 122 \natmosphere from sea spray are derived from the well-mixed reservoir of marine 123 \nsulphate and have a \u03b434S value identical to that of sea water (~ +21 \u2030). Biogenic 124 \nsources of secondary sulphate aerosol are derived from marine emissions of 125 \ndimethylsulphide (DMS) and are generally depleted in 34S relative to seawater 126 \nsulphate, with reported \u03b434S values of +15.6 \u00b13.1 \u2030 (Calhoun et al., 1991). 127 \nContinental emissions of sulphate aerosol can be divided into anthropogenic and 128 \nbiogenic emissions. In the northern hemisphere, sulphate in precipitation sourced 129 \npredominantly from anthropogenic emissions is usually assigned an average \u03b434S 130 \nvalue between -3 and +9 \u2030 (Mayer, 1998), despite the \u03b434S composition of the source 131 \nmaterials varying beyond this range (see compilation of source material values in 132 \nNielson, 1974). Continental biogenic emissions of sulphur consist predominantly of 133 \ngaseous organic sulphides from the decomposition of organic matter associated with 134 \nplants and soils. Such emissions have a wide range of \u03b434S values depending upon the 135 \nredox status under which they are formed. Under oxidising conditions, their isotopic 136 \ncomposition should be similar to that of local precursor sulphate derived from 137 \nprecipitation, groundwater and lithogenic sources. This is quoted to have an average 138 \n\u03b434S value close to 0 \u2030 (Nielson, 1974), although reducing conditions induce 139 \nextensive fractionation to the source compounds. This fractionation varies with 140 \nenvironmental conditions although when the size of the substrate pool is unlimited, 141 \ngaseous organic sulphides may be fractionated so they are up to 70 \u2030 lighter than the 142 \nprecursor sulphate (Brunner and Bernasconi, 2005). 143 \n  144 \nDue to the widely differing source composition of oxygen isotopes involved in the 145 \noxidation of sulphur compounds to sulphate, the oxygen isotopic composition of 146 \nsulphate in speleothems should enable the distinction between sulphate which is 147 \nsourced directly from the atmosphere and that produced by nutrient cycling in 148 \nterrestrial ecosystems (e.g.: Mayer et al., 1995a, b; Likens et al., 2002), thus aiding 149 \nprocess- identification as well as source provenance. Published values for the \u03b418O 150 \ncomposition of atmospheric sulphate range from -3 to +41.7 \u2030 VSMOW (see 151 \ncompilation of published values in Jamieson and Wadleigh, 1999; Jenkins and Bao, 152 \n2006). This wide range reflects the different reaction pathways of gaseous sulphide 153 \noxidation in the atmosphere, the oxygen isotopic composition of the oxidants involved 154 \nand the mixing ratio between aerosols formed at source as sulphate (primary aerosols) 155 \nand those produced in the atmosphere from gaseous precursors (secondary aerosols) 156 \n(see review by Holt and Kumar, 1991). Secondary aerosols formed from gaseous 157 \nprecursors do not carry oxygen isotopic signatures indicative of source provenance, 158 \nbut reflect only the pathways of sulphide oxidation in the atmosphere due to a rapid 159 \nisotopic equilibration between reduced sulphoxy intermediate species and H2O. 160 \nSource provenance signatures of \u03b418O in reduced sulphur compounds emitted into the 161 \natmosphere are thus erased during oxidation to secondary aerosol species.  Primary 162 \nsulphate aerosols retain their source \u03b418O-SO4 composition during transport through the 163 \natmosphere. These can be sourced from sea spray (+9.7 \u2030; Lloyd, 1967) or from 164 \nindustrial activity with \u03b418O-SO4 signatures up to +45 \u2030 (Holt et al., 1982; Jamieson 165 \nand Wadleigh 1999). The proportion of primary aerosol present in the atmosphere 166 \nthus significantly influences the value of bulk \u03b418O-SO4 aerosol deposition.  167 \n 168 \nSubsequent to sulphate aerosol deposition, biogeochemical cycling of sulphur resets 169 \nthe oxygen isotopic composition of atmospheric-derived sulphate according to 170 \nenvironmental conditions. Where aerobic oxidising conditions prevail in the overlying 171 \ncave soils, biogeochemical cycling of deposited sulphate may induce assimilatory 172 \nsulphate reduction to organic-S compounds and mineralisation back into the inorganic 173 \nphase. This causes only minimal fractionation to 34S\/32S ratios compared to precursor 174 \nsulphate derived from precipitation, groundwater and lithogenic sources. Sulphate 175 \n18O\/16O ratios however, are a product of incorporating four oxygen atoms obtained in 176 \nvarying proportions from the surrounding soil water and atmospheric oxygen 177 \n(Equation 1). 178 \n 179 \n\u03b418O-SO4 = [(\u03b418Oatm O2 \u2013 \u03b5 SO4-atm) \u00d7 fO2 atm ] + (\u03b418Owater \u00d71- fO2 atm)  (1) 180 \n 181 \nwhere fO2 atm and 1- fO2 atm represent the fraction of oxygen obtained from the 182 \natmosphere and soil water respectively, and \u03b418O-atm O2 and \u03b418O-water represent the 183 \noxygen isotopic compositions of atmospheric O2 (+23.88 \u2030; Barkan and Lus, 2005) 184 \nand water. \u03b5 SO4-atm is the isotopic enrichment associated with the incorporation of 185 \natmospheric O2 into sulphate, demonstrated experimentally to have a value of -8.7 \u2030 186 \n(Lloyd, 1968). 187 \n 188 \nSulphoxy intermediate compounds (SO, SO2, HSO3\n-) can be exposed to rapid isotopic 189 \nequilibration with the surrounding water. The isotopic composition of the constituent 190 \noxygen can thus be reset such that up to 75% of the oxygen in the final sulphate 191 \nmolecule has an isotopic composition controlled by meteoric water (Holt, 1981). 192 \nWhere mineralisation of organic compounds to sulphate is sufficiently rapid such that 193 \nsulphoxy intermediate species do not become fully equilibrated with meteoric water, 194 \nthe final sulphate molecule may contain a greater proportion of oxygen sourced from 195 \natmospheric O2 (Bottrell, 2007). The \u03b4\n18O-CAS contained within speleothem calcite is 196 \nthus sensitive to the relative proportions of atmospheric O2 and water oxygen 197 \nincorporated into the sulphate molecule. Isotopic signatures may therefore have a 198 \ntheoretical upper end-member composition of +14.8 \u2030 where all four oxygen atoms 199 \nare derived from atmospheric O2 (Bottrell and Newton, 2006) and range towards the 200 \noxygen isotopic composition of the ambient water where equilibration with meteoric 201 \nwater imparts up to 75% of the isotopic composition. Where sulphur is contained 202 \nwithin organic matter as ester sulphate compounds and liberated through enzyme 203 \nhydrolysis (e.g. Fitzgerald, 1976), at least three of the oxygen atoms in the newly 204 \nmineralised sulphate are sourced directly from the organically bound sulphate 205 \nmolecule.  As such, a depletion of only 2-3 \u2030 is observed in oxygen isotope 206 \ncomposition compared to the original sulphate ester compound (Mayer et al., 1995b).  207 \n 208 \nUnder reducing conditions, processes of microbial sulphate reduction may cause 209 \nextensive kinetic fractionation of \u03b434S. Fractionation of \u03b418O-SO4 however, is manifest 210 \nas an equilibrium isotopic exchange between the ambient water and the residual 211 \nsulphate pool such that an enrichment factor of +29 \u2030 at 5 \u00b0C may be apparent if 212 \nequilibrium is approached (Fritz et al., 1989; Brunner et al., 2005; Wortmann et al., 213 \n2007). During initial stages of sulphate reduction, \u03b434S-SO4 and \u03b418O-SO4 signatures 214 \ndemonstrate a linear fractionation relationship, typical of a kinetic reaction 215 \nmechanism. When sulphate reduction reaches an advanced state however, residual 216 \n\u03b418O-SO4 signatures approach a constant equilibrium value and \u03b4\n34S-SO4 residual 217 \nsignatures continue to become enriched in 34S according to a typical Rayleigh 218 \nfractionation trajectory (Brunner et al., 2005). Where cyclical reduction - re-oxidation 219 \nof sulphate occurs within the same environment, values of \u03b418O-SO4 may display an 220 \noffset between the equilibrium oxygen isotope signature and the measured values. Re-221 \noxidation of sulphite to sulphate involves the incorporation of one additional oxygen 222 \nfrom an external source such as water (enrichment factor = + 4 \u2030; cf.Taylor et al., 223 \n1984). The resulting oxygen isotope composition in the residual sulphate can be 224 \napproximated as; 225 \n 226 \n\u03b418O-SO4 = [0.75 \u00d7 (\u03b418OH2O + \u03b5 SO4-H2O)] + 0.25 \u00d7 (\u03b418OH2O + 4 \u2030)]   (2) 227 \n 228 \nwhere \u03b5 SO4-H2O is the equilibrium isotopic enrichment between \u03b418O in the residual 229 \nsulphate pool and that in the surrounding water (after Brunner et al., 2005). The 230 \ninfluence of re-oxidation upon 34S values however will be to retain a signature similar 231 \nto the initial products if isotope mass balance is maintained (e.g., Barker et al., 1998). 232 \nThe extraction and analysis of \u03b434S and \u03b418O from speleothem CAS thus holds the 233 \npotential to record the sulphur sources and biogeochemical transformations present 234 \nalong the flow pathways of speleothem-feeding drips. 235 \n 236 \nTraditional methods used for the extraction and analysis of SO4-S and SO4-O from 237 \ncarbonates rely on the acid digestion of large quantities of material (typically 100 to 238 \n300 g) and the extraction of sulphate as barium sulphate (e.g. Gellatly and Lyons, 239 \n2005). The large volumes of carbonate material required have thus frequently 240 \nconstrained the type of samples analysed for sulphate isotopic composition. Where 241 \ngeological carbonates are present in abundance or contain significant quantities of 242 \nsulphur, such constraints are not applicable. However, in speleothem carbonate, 243 \nsulphur content is low and the material available for analysis is necessarily limited. 244 \nNew methods to reduce the sample size of carbonate material required for the 245 \nextraction and analysis of \u03b434S-SO4 and \u03b418O-SO4 have been developed as a part of this 246 \nstudy, thus enabling the sulphur isotopic characterisation of speleothem archives. 247 \nHere we report the first determinations of 34S\/32S and 18O\/16O ratios of CAS extracted 248 \nfrom speleothems. The samples originate from two cave sites in contrasting locations, 249 \ndemonstrating the power of the dual isotope approach for palaeoenvironmental 250 \ninterpretation. We compare modern time series of a stalagmite collected from within 251 \nBrowns Folly Mine, UK, where values of \u03b434S-CAS illustrate a dominant control by 252 \nanthropogenic SO2 emissions, with that of a stalagmite from Crag Cave, S.W Ireland, 253 \nyielding \u03b434S-CAS and \u03b418O-CAS signatures representative of sulphate reduction and re-254 \noxidation in the soils above the cave.    255 \n 256 \n3. SITE AND SAMPLE DESCRIPTION 257 \n 258 \nBrowns Folly Mine, Bathford, SW England, was developed in the 19th century for the 259 \nextraction of building stone from the surrounding limestone (the Bath Oolite member 260 \nof the Jurassic Great Oolite series) (for cross section of mine site see Baldini et al., 261 \n2005; Fairchild et al., 2006b). Mining activity commenced in 1836 and continued 262 \nuntil the mines were abandoned in 1886, thus constraining the maximum possible age 263 \nof the associated speleothems. The mines remained closed for approximately 100 264 \nyears until re-opened by cavers in the 1970s (Baker et al., 1998, 1999). Lithologies of 265 \nthe overlying Middle Jurassic bedrock are mainly oolitic and skeletal limestones, 266 \ncontaining a minor sand and clay component and a porosity of 0 to 40 % (Fairchild et 267 \nal., 2006b), with an absence of pyrite and other sulphide minerals. Vertical fractures 268 \ndissect the horizontally stratified limestone formations providing a route for rapid 269 \nfissure flow of groundwater into the mine system. Slower seepage flow is fed by 270 \nminor fissures and water stored within the porous limestone matrix (Baker et al., 271 \n1999; Fairchild et al., 2006b). Vegetation has gradually re-established itself over the 272 \nstudy site since the cessation of mining operations in 1886 such that secondary 273 \ndeciduous forest of mixed ash, sycamore and oak is now prevalent (Baldini et al., 274 \n2005). The sampled stalagmite (BFM-Boss) was extracted in 1996 from a chamber 275 \napproximately 300 m from the mine entrance (Baldini et al., 2005) and represents a 276 \ncontinuous deposition of calcite in annual couplets of clear and inclusion-rich 277 \nlaminae. Three independent lamina thickness counts established 77\u00b13 annual couplets 278 \nat the central growth axis suggesting that BFM-Boss nucleated no later than 1916. 279 \nAnnual calcite deposition rates remained low until 1975, when couplet thicknesses 280 \nincrease dramatically, indicating an increase in growth rate. The nucleation of BFM-281 \nBoss approximately 30 years after the closure of the mines is thought to reflect either 282 \nthe time taken for the development of a stable hydrological system subsequent to the 283 \ncessation of mining activity, or the slow rate of vegetation establishment above the 284 \ncave site. Baldini et al., (2005) showed that vegetation development had a strong 285 \ninfluence on the \u03b413C and \u03b418O record of this sample. 286 \n 287 \nCrag Cave, located in County Kerry, Ireland, is developed in Lower Carboniferous 288 \nlimestone some 20 km from the Atlantic coast of SW Ireland (McDermott et al., 289 \n1999) (for site details see Tooth and Fairchild 2003; Baldini et al., 2006). Discovered 290 \nin 1981, parts of the relatively shallow cave system (c. 20m deep) were opened as a 291 \ntourist cave in 1985, although restricted access to the cave interior has ensured the 292 \nmaintenance of near-pristine conditions, rendering it ideal for hydrochemical studies 293 \n(Baldini et al., 2006). The surrounding bedrock, belonging to the Lower 294 \nCarboniferous Cloonagh Formation is dominantly limestone, with small amounts of 295 \ndolomite and some pyrite (Tooth and Fairchild, 2003). Till deposits overlying the 296 \ncave are of variable thickness (0.1-2.5m thickness) belonging to the Munsterian 297 \n(Marine Isotope Stage 6) glaciation. The low permeability of the fine grained clay 298 \nmatrix encourages saturation and a constant supply of water to the stalagmite-feeding 299 \ndrips, and streaks of iron oxide staining demonstrate the presence of oxidising 300 \nconditions in isolated zones and hence the existence of redox cycling. The presence of 301 \na crack and fissure network allows the till deposits to be regarded as a dual-porosity 302 \nsystem, facilitating both rapid water throughput via fracture flow and a more constant 303 \nmatrix seepage flow supplied from the large storage capacity of the micropores 304 \n(Tooth and Fairchild, 2003). The sampled stalagmite, CC-Bil, was removed from a 305 \npassage 30 m below the ground surface in 2002. The drip that fed stalagmite CC-Bil 306 \nformed on the tip of a 1m long soda straw stalactite and is classed as a \u2018seepage flow 307 \nsite\u2019 under the classification of Smart and Friederich (1986). Drip rates at this site and 308 \nothers in close proximity are low (site CC-Bil = 0.08 ml\/min) and show very little 309 \nvariation through time (site CC-Bil drip rate CV = 5.4 %) (Tooth and Fairchild, 2003; 310 \nBaldini et al., 2006). Based on visible calcite deposition on loggers underneath the 311 \ndrip feeding stalagmite CC-Bil, this stalagmite was actively growing when collected 312 \nin 2002. U-series dating demonstrates a basal mean ICP-MS U-Th age of 1752 AD 313 \n(+\/- 7 years) and an approximately linear growth rate over the past 260 years. 314 \n 315 \n4. METHODOLOGY 316 \n4.1. Sulphate extraction 317 \n 318 \nSulphur concentrations in each of the stalagmites were determined by high resolution inductively 319 \ncoupled plasma mass spectrometric analysis (HR-ICPMS) of calcite powders at Kingston University, 320 \nUK, drilled in 2 mg aliquots from the central axis of the stalagmite and digested in 8 ml of 2 % HNO3 321 \n(Aristar grade). Depending upon the concentration of CAS, larger aliquots of calcite (~200 mg) were 322 \nprepared for sulphur and oxygen isotope analysis by sampling in a continuous fashion down the 323 \nstalagmite central growth axis, each sample aggregating several years of growth. Using the 324 \nconcentration data obtained through HR-ICPMS analysis, the size of each carbonate sample was 325 \ncalculated to yield a minimum of 35 \u00b5g of sulphur, representing the quantity of sulphur required for 326 \nanalysis by CF-IRMS (continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry) given the instrumental 327 \nconfiguration outlined below. Parallel sampling tracks enabled the integrity of \u03b434S and \u03b418O analyses 328 \nto be assessed through sample replication. The methodological approach to sulphur and oxygen isotope 329 \nextraction was based upon procedures reported in Newton et al. (2004), albeit simplified as the relative 330 \npurity of stalagmite carbonate precluded the need for pre-treatment with sodium hypochlorite and 331 \nbromine water to remove organic contaminants and trace amounts of pyrite, respectively. Given the 332 \nsmall quantities of sulphur extracted per sample, the following protocol was designed to minimise 333 \nsample handling and contamination in all steps of the procedure. 334 \n 335 \nDrilled stalagmite powders were digested overnight in 1 ml of 4M hydrochloric acid (Aristar grade) 336 \nwithin polyethylene syringes, capped with Luer tips. Syringe filtration through pre-rinsed 0.2\u00b5m nylon 337 \nfilter capsules (Puradisc, Whatman\u00ae) enabled sample transfer between vessels with the minimum of 338 \nproduct loss. The extraction of sulphate as barium sulphate was undertaken following precipitation 339 \nusing barium chloride solution. Two different techniques of precipitate concentration were used to 340 \ncollect the barium sulphate from solution: filtration and centrifugation. Where filtration was the method 341 \nemployed, 0.5 ml of 1 M barium chloride solution was added to the filtered carbonate digest solution 342 \nwithin the housing of a second polyethylene syringe. Samples were left to precipitate and mature for 2 343 \n\u2013 3 days, prior to syringe filtration through quartz microfibre filters using an in-line filter capsule 344 \n(Swinnex, millipore) modified to hold filter papers 7 mm in diameter. Each filter loaded with 35 \u00b5g of 345 \nS (~250 \u00b5g BaSO4) was transferred into a tin capsule, dried at 70 \u00b0C and stored in a desiccator prior to 346 \nmass spectrometric analysis (Figure 2). 347 \n 348 \nHowever, based upon the decomposition of quartz above 700 \u00b0C and the release of constituent oxygen, 349 \nthe use of quartz microfibre filters as a means of pre-concentrating barium sulphate precluded analysis 350 \nfor \u03b418O-SO4 by this method. Centrifugation in association with an inert medium was thus employed as 351 \nthe method of pre-concentration for the remainder of the study. Carbonate digest solutions were 352 \nsyringe-filtered into 1.5 ml centrifuge vials and precipitated as barium sulphate following addition of 353 \n0.2 ml of 1M barium chloride solution. Contact time between free sulphate ions in solution with strong 354 \nacid was minimised to ~ 1 hour to prevent potential oxygen isotopic exchange between sulphate and 355 \nwater under acidic conditions (e.g. Gellatly and Lyons, 2005;  Newton et al., 2004; Hurtgen et al., 356 \n2002). Addition of quartz powder (~ 2 mg; EuroVector isotopic grade) served as an inert medium onto 357 \nwhich barium sulphate could precipitate, thus increasing the mass of product and enabling ease of 358 \nhandling. Sulphate for \u03b418O analysis was precipitated onto powdered glassy carbon (~ 0.5 mg, Euro 359 \nVector isotopic grade) as the inert medium. Samples of barium sulphate were left to mature for ~72 360 \nhours prior to repeated centrifuging and washing with de-ionised water to remove excess barium. The 361 \nresultant pellets of quartz powder with barium sulphate and glassy carbon with barium sulphate were 362 \noven dried at 70 \u00b0C and transferred to tin or silver capsules for \u03b434S and \u03b418O analysis respectively 363 \n(Figure 2).  364 \n 365 \nTo overcome possible problems associated with oxygen release during the decomposition of quartz 366 \npowder contributing to SO2 beam intensities and thus influencing \u03b4\n34S measurements (e.g. Fry et al., 367 \n2002), similar quantities of quartz powder were added to standard materials as well as samples prior to 368 \ncombustion. This effectively supplied a large reservoir of oxygen in the form of quartz powder, 369 \nbuffering the oxygen composition of the SO2 gas for both samples and standards. 370 \n 371 \n4.2. Mass spectrometric analysis 372 \n 373 \n34S\/32S and 18O\/16O ratios of product barium sulphate were determined using a EuroVector elemental 374 \nanalyser linked to a GV Isoprime continuous flow mass spectrometer at the University of Birmingham. 375 \nCombustion of samples within tin capsules in the presence of vanadium pentoxide at 1030 \u00b0C yielded 376 \nSO2 for determination of \u03b4\n34S-SO4 and pyrolysis within silver capsules in the presence of nickelised 377 \ncarbon at 1250 \u00b0C yielded CO for determination of \u03b418O-SO4. \u03b4\n34S values were corrected against CDT 378 \nusing within run analyses of international standard NBS-127 and SO5 (assuming \u03b434S values of +20.3 379 \n\u2030 and +0.5 \u2030 respectively (IAEA, 2004)) and \u03b418O was corrected to VSMOW using  NBS-127 and 380 \nSO6 (assuming \u03b418O values of +9.3 \u2030 and -11.3 \u2030 respectively (IAEA, 2004)). Within-run standard 381 \nreplication (1 SD) was <0.3 \u2030 for both sulphur and oxygen. Sample replication from two parallel 382 \nsample tracks drilled in stalagmite BFM-Boss were < 0.4 \u2030 (1 SD) for \u03b434S values and < 0.5 \u2030 for 383 \n\u03b418O values based on sample replication in stalagmite CC-Bil. 384 \n 385 \nProcedural standard solutions of calcium sulphate and sodium sulphate were used to test the integrity of 386 \nthe methodology for precipitation and analysis of small quantities of barium sulphate for \u03b434S and \u03b418O 387 \ndeterminations respectively. Calcium sulphate solution precipitated as barium sulphate under acidified 388 \nconditions and analysed according to the above methodology using quartz microfibre filters, yielded 389 \n\u03b434S-SO4 signatures of +3.2 \u2030 (0.3 \u2030 1 SD, n = 20) compared to \u03b4\n34S values of  +2.9 \u2030 (0.3 \u2030 1 SD, 390 \nn = 13) for analysis of raw calcium sulphate powder. Where centrifuging with quartz powder was used 391 \nas the method of pre-concentration, analyses of standard calcium sulphate solution precipitated as 392 \nbarium sulphate, yielded \u03b434S-SO4 isotopic values of +2.6 \u2030 (0.3 \u2030 1 SD, n = 12). Sodium sulphate 393 \nsolution precipitated as a bulk quantity of barium sulphate yielded \u03b418O-SO4 isotopic signatures of +12.6 394 \n\u2030 (0.4 \u2030 1 SD, n = 8) compared to analyses obtained following the centrifuging method of pre-395 \nconcentration under analogous acidified conditions, of +13.0 \u2030 (0.7 \u2030 1 SD, n = 6). 396 \n 397 \nBlank contamination associated with \u03b434S determinations were zero. A small blank signal associated 398 \nwith oxygen analysis is most likely associated with trace levels of oxides on the glassy carbon and 399 \nnickelised carbon catalyst, but was too small to determine accurately. To overcome the potential impact 400 \nof blank contribution upon reported \u03b418O values, standard materials and samples were analysed using 401 \nthe same quantities of glassy carbon powder and nickelised carbon catalyst. 402 \n 403 \n5. RESULTS 404 \n 405 \n5.1. BFM-Boss 406 \n 407 \nFigure 3 displays sulphur concentrations and \u03b434S and \u03b418O values of carbonate 408 \nassociated sulphate in stalagmite BFM-Boss. Sulphur concentrations are between 150 409 \nto 250 ppm (Table 1) and are coincidentally similar to those of the surrounding 410 \nbedrock (range 156 to 312 ppm) (Table 2). The \u03b434S-CAS values associated with BFM-411 \nBoss are between +3.5 and +5.5 \u2030 and significantly lower than those contained 412 \nwithin the surrounding bedrock (+17.9 to +22.0 \u2030). \u03b418O-CAS signatures within the 413 \nspeleothem range between  +10.3 \u2030 to +13.7 \u2030. Table 3 displays the ionic 414 \ncomposition of the feeding drip-water to stalagmite BFM-Boss. Sulphate 415 \nconcentrations displayed as a percentage sea-salt sulphate (% SSS) are calculated on 416 \nthe assumption that sea spray has a molar SO4\/Cl ratio of 0.0516 and is the source of 417 \nall Cl- in the drip waters (after Holland, 1978), such that 29 % (1 SD = 15%) of all 418 \nsulphate is calculated to be of inorganic marine provenance. Further, sulphate 419 \nconcentrations within drip waters comprise just 1.4 % sulphate sourced from the 420 \nbedrock based on Ca\/SO4 ratios given in Table 2 (equation 3). 421 \n 422 \n% bedrockSO4 = [1 \/ (\nbedrock Ca:SO4 \/ \ndripwaterCa) \/ dripwater SO4] \u00d7 100   (3) 423 \n 424 \n This assumes all calcium in the cave drip waters is sourced from dissolution of the 425 \nkarst bedrock, with negligible contribution from dissolution of calcareous dust 426 \nparticulates in the atmosphere, and assumes ratios are unaffected through chemical 427 \nevolution associated with limited levels of prior calcite precipitation (Tooth and 428 \nFairchild, 2003). 429 \n 430 \n5.2. CC-Bil 431 \n 432 \nSulphur concentrations within stalagmite CC-Bil are between 100 and 200 ppm and 433 \nvalues of \u03b434S-CAS range between +16.8 and +19.1 \u2030 and \u03b4\n18O-CAS between +19.2 and 434 \n+23.9 \u2030 (Table 4, Fig 4). Bedrock concentrations of sulphur are low and range 435 \nbetween 51 and 92 ppm (Table 2), and isotopes of \u03b434S and \u03b418O within the lower 436 \nCarboniferous limestone within which Crag Cave is formed are reported to range 437 \nbetween +13 to +15 \u2030 for \u03b434S based on CAS-derived S isotopes and +14 to +19 \u2030 438 \nfor \u03b418O based on marine evaporites (Bottrell and Newton, 2006). Drip sites feeding 439 \nand immediately adjacent to stalagmite CC-Bil display sulphate concentrations which 440 \nare consistently between 7.9 to 8.5 ppm. % SSS consistently accounts for 36 % of the 441 \nmeasured drip water sulphate and % bedrock-derived sulphate represents just 1.1 % of 442 \ndrip water sulphate composition (Table 4).  443 \n 444 \n6. DISCUSSION 445 \n 446 \n6.1. Browns Folly Mine; BFM-Boss 447 \n 448 \nOn the understanding that the chloride content of cave drip waters can be used as an 449 \nindicator of primary sea spray aerosol content at each site, apportionment of 450 \nspeleothem CAS between the remaining sources is possible using the \u03b434S end 451 \nmember compositions and \u03b418O process information outlined above. Based on the 452 \n%SSS content and ratio of calcium to sulphate in cave drip waters feeding stalagmite 453 \nBFM-Boss (Table 3), 29 % of the constituent sulphate appears to be of primary 454 \nmarine origin and just 1.4 % is sourced from the carbonate bedrock. As the \u03b434S 455 \nmarine end-member value for primary sea salt aerosol is +21\u2030 and the bedrock has 456 \nan average \u03b434S composition of +20 \u2030, mass balance suggests the additional source 457 \nof sulphur contributing to contemporary speleothem CAS must have a \u03b434S value 458 \nclose to -3 \u2030 (actual measured \u03b434S composition +3.5 to +5.5 \u2030). On the basis that 459 \nanthropogenic emissions of sulphur in precipitation are documented to reside between 460 \n-3 and +9 \u2030 in industrialised countries of the northern hemisphere (Mayer, 1998), 461 \nthis would suggest the non sea salt sulphur within stalagmite BFM BOSS is derived 462 \npredominantly from anthropogenic pollution (e.g., Zhao et al., 1998) (Fig. 5). Such an 463 \ninterpretation is consistent with the industrial nature of the region surrounding this 464 \nparticular site. Continental biogenic emissions of reduced sulphur compounds may 465 \nalso have \u03b434S values within the range required to account for the additional source of 466 \nsulphur contributing to speleothem CAS. However, oxidation of such biogenic 467 \nemissions within the atmosphere would render the constituent oxygen isotopes too 468 \nlight to account for the source of speleothem sulphate (see Figure 5). Bedrock-derived 469 \nCAS \u03b434S values (+17.8 to +21.9 \u2030) are considerably higher than sulphate 470 \nstructurally bound within stalagmite calcite. Release of this heavy bedrock sulphate 471 \ninto groundwaters may contribute an additional source of sulphate to the drip water, 472 \nalthough in the most recently deposited speleothem calcite, bedrock sulphate 473 \ncontributes just 1.4 % of the total stalagmite CAS composition. \u03b434S values are stable 474 \nbetween 1960 to 1992 at ~ +3.6 \u2030, although calcite deposited prior to 1962 hosts 475 \n\u03b434S-CAS values up to +5.5 \u2030. This may reflect lower sulphur emissions from 476 \nindustrial activity during the early 20th C and relatively greater contributions from 477 \nmarine and bedrock derived sources with heavier sulphur isotopic composition. The 478 \nlack of co variation between sulphur concentrations and sulphur isotopes post 1960 479 \nmay reflect the dominant source of anthropogenic sulphur in the atmosphere. The 480 \nminimal relative contribution from additional sulphur sources may cause little 481 \nperturbation from pollution end-member compositions. 482 \n 483 \n\u03b418O-CAS signatures range from +10.3 \u2030 to +13.7 \u2030, with the heavier isotopic values 484 \nfound during the earlier growth phases of the stalagmite. These signatures fall in a 485 \nrange where interpretations of sulphur cycling in the sediments and biomass above the 486 \ncave are somewhat ambiguous. The \u03b418O-CAS compositions are similar to those 487 \nexpected in atmospheric sulphate deposition (Figure 5) and could represent a direct 488 \ntransfer of atmospheric precipitation into the cave environment via rapid flow routing, 489 \nhaving undergone very little biogeochemical transformation. Based on 29 % sea salt 490 \nsulphate contribution as primary marine aerosol (\u03b418O-SO4 of primary marine aerosol 491 \nis +9.7 \u2030 (Lloyd, 1967)), the remaining non sea salt sulphate (NSS) in the youngest 492 \npart of the stalagmite is calculated to have an end member composition of +10.9 \u2030, 493 \ntypical for atmospheric sulphate deposition of mixed primary anthropgenic and 494 \nsecondary aerosol sulphate origin. 495 \n 496 \nTo produce drip water sulphate with 18O\/16O ratios identical to those found in 497 \nspeleothem CAS via biogeochemical mineralisation of organic sulphur would require 498 \napproximately 80 % of the constituent oxygen to be sourced from atmospheric O2 499 \n(assuming fractionation during the mineralisation and incorporation of atmospheric 500 \noxygen into sulphate to be -8.7 \u2030 (Lloyd, 1968) and an average drip water \u03b418O-H2O 501 \ncomposition of -5 \u2030. However, given that experimental data have demonstrated 502 \nbiological reaction pathways may produce sulphate containing a maximum of 55 % 503 \natmospheric O2 only under exceptional circumstances (Toran and Harris, 1989), the 504 \nbiogeochemical mineralisation of organic sulphur compounds to sulphate is not 505 \nconsidered to be apparent in the drip water flow pathway feeding this stalagmite (Fig. 506 \n5).  507 \n 508 \nIf the main source of sulphate contained within organic matter is present as organic 509 \nester sulphate compounds, hydrolysis may produce free sulphate ions within a 2-3 \u2030 510 \nrange of the oxygen isotopic composition of the original sulphate compound (Mayer 511 \net al., 1995b). This would give an initial oxygen isotopic composition of 512 \napproximately 12-13 \u2030, consistent with an atmospheric aerosol source.  513 \n 514 \nThere is clear evidence at this cave site for both a long term hydrological storage 515 \ncomponent and a very rapid flow route at times of high rainfall (Fairchild et al., 516 \n2006b), thus both mechanisms (ester sulphate hydrolysis and rapid flow routing) 517 \nremain possible contributors to the observed \u03b418O-CAS signatures at this site. 518 \n 519 \n6.2. Crag Cave; CC-Bil  520 \n 521 \nCrag Cave presents a contrasting case in being largely isolated from sources of 522 \nanthropogenic SO2 emissions and the large scale combustion of fossil fuels due to a 523 \npredominantly westerly airflow and its position on the western periphery of Europe 524 \n(Aherne and Farrell, 2002). Prevailing westerly winds typically provide the main 525 \nsource of atmospheric sulphur transporting aerosol of primary sea salt origin onto the 526 \ncontinental margin (Aherne and Farrell, 2002; Jordan, 1997). 527 \n  528 \nRatios of sulphate to chloride in atmospheric deposition from the region typically 529 \ndefine a sea salt component of ~80 % (Aherne and Farrell, 2002; Jordan, 1997), of 530 \nwhich the remaining 20% could be sourced from DMS, distal sources of pollution, or 531 \ncontinental biogenic emissions. This contrasts with ratios to chloride in drip waters 532 \nfeeding stalagmite CC-Bil, where just 35% of sulphate is of sea salt origin. This 533 \nsuggests an additional source of sulphur is obtained from somewhere along the drip 534 \nwater flow path. Values of \u03b434S-CAS in recent speleothem calcite are +18.6 \u2030 (Table 535 \n4), leaving an end-member non sea salt sulphate composition of +17.2 \u2030. This value 536 \nappears typical of measured atmospheric deposition in the region (Bottrell and Novak, 537 \n1997; quoted average value of +17.8 \u2030) although could represent any mixture of 538 \natmospheric sources stored within the soil profile as organic sulphur, prior to re-539 \nmineralisation and release into the drip water flow path. Based on a comparison of 540 \nCa\/SO4 ratios in bedrocks and drip waters, carbonation and release of sulphate from 541 \nthe surrounding bedrock appears to contribute just 1.1 % of sulphate to the drip water 542 \ncomposition and is thus insufficient to account for the additional sulphate source. 543 \nSignatures of \u03b418O-CAS are used below to try and identify the nature of this additional 544 \nnon sea salt sulphate. 545 \n 546 \nValues of \u03b418O-CAS are isotopically enriched in 18O beyond that expected for values of 547 \natmospheric sulphate in an environment distal from extensive inputs of industrial 548 \npollution. \u03b418O-CAS  values are also  in excess of sulphate oxygen signatures produced 549 \nthrough 1) biogeochemical mineralisation of sulphur to sulphate under oxidising 550 \nconditions; 2) oxidation of continental biogenic emissions released into the 551 \natmosphere; 3) oxidation of marine DMS compounds; or 4) the release of primary 552 \nseasalt aerosol (Figure 6). The only feasible mechanism of obtaining oxygen isotopes 553 \nso enriched in 18O would entail a degree of sulphate reduction. During initial stages of 554 \nsulphate reduction, \u03b434S-SO4 and \u03b418O-SO4 signatures demonstrate a linear fractionation 555 \nrelationship, typical of a kinetic reaction mechanism. However at an advanced stage 556 \nof sulphate reduction, equilibrium oxygen isotope exchange between reduced sulphur 557 \ncompounds and ambient water enables enrichment of 18O in residual sulphur 558 \ncompounds dependent upon the temperature and isotopic composition of the 559 \nsurrounding water (enrichment ~ +28 \u2030 at cave temperature of 10.4\u00b0C; cf. Fritz et al., 560 \n1989). Given that the average \u03b418O-H2O composition of the drip water feeding 561 \nstalagmite CC-Bil has a value of -5.4 \u2030, equilibrium isotopic exchange during 562 \nsulphate reduction would thus impart an oxygen isotopic composition approaching 563 \n+23 \u2030 in the residual sulphate, similar to that measured in stalagmite CC-Bil (Table 564 \n4). The offset between the lowest measured \u03b418O-CAS  composition and the proposed 565 \nequilibrium value of +23 \u2030 may indicate a small contribution from the re-oxidation 566 \nof sulphur compounds and the direct incorporation of an oxygen atom from water 567 \nduring sulphite oxidation. The range in \u03b418O-CAS signatures through time is thus likely 568 \nexplained through differences in the oxygen isotope exchange rates according to 569 \nchanges in the oxygen isotope composition of ambient water, temperature variations 570 \nand the degree of re-oxidation (Brunner et al., 2005).  571 \n 572 \nGiven the extent of sulphate reduction inferred to occur along the drip water flow 573 \npath, provenancing the source of additional sulphate using isotopic end member 574 \nanalysis is not possible. The following two mechanisms may produce drip waters at 575 \nCrag Cave with sulphate isotopic compositions similar to those measured in CC-Bil. 576 \n1) The oxidation of pyrite to sulphate would typically contribute a source of 577 \nisotopically light sulphur. Subsequent reduction of sulphate may produce residual 578 \nsulphate enriched in 34S and 18O. Such a mechanism would have to occur under a 579 \nsystem where regions of reduction are spatially isolated from areas of sulphide 580 \noxidation, thus allowing kinetic fractionation and enrichment of 34S in the residual 581 \nsulphate pool. Given the local presence of pyrite within bedrock horizons sampled 582 \nfrom elsewhere within the cave (Tooth and Fairchild, 2003), this remains a potential 583 \nsource and cannot be disregarded conclusively.  2) Alternatively, the mineralisation of 584 \norganic sulphur compounds to sulphate may contribute an additional source of 585 \nsulphur with similar isotopic composition to that found in atmospheric precipitation. 586 \nExtensive cyclical sulphate reduction\/re-oxidation will enrich oxygen isotopes to a 587 \nfew per mille lighter than the equilibrium value of +23 \u2030, whilst sulphur isotopes 588 \nwill undergo very little net fractionation between atmospheric deposition and drip 589 \nwater composition as isotope mass balance is maintained. Net fractionation of sulphur 590 \nisotopes would be close to unity and reduction\/oxidation would have to take place 591 \nwithout extensive product loss from the reactant pool. The sulphur isotopic 592 \ncomposition of speleothem CAS should thus reflect the isotopic composition of 593 \natmospheric sulphur deposition, assuming minimal fractionation during uptake and 594 \ncycling through vegetation. The soil and vegetation thus acts as a store of organic 595 \nsulphur which is slowly released into dripwater flowpaths and speleothem calcite (cf. 596 \nEinsiedel et al., 2006).  597 \n 598 \nThus, based on \u03b434S and \u03b418O signatures obtained from speleothem CAS at Crag 599 \nCave, the drip water feeding stalagmite CC-Bil appears to be subjected to reducing 600 \nconditions along the flowpath, mostly likely within the till. The water-saturated nature 601 \nof the fine grained, clay rich till above the cave provides the necessary conditions for 602 \nsulphate reduction, whilst patches of iron staining and soil pH as low as 3.5 may be 603 \nindicative of sulphide oxidation utilising FeIII as an oxidising agent under sub-oxic 604 \nconditions (Soil profile descriptions obtained from Tooth, 2000). For pyrite oxidation 605 \nand subsequent reduction to produce isotopic values similar to those observed in 606 \nspeleothem CAS, processes of oxidation and reduction must be spatially separate.  607 \nWhere cyclical sulphate reduction\/re-oxidation is apparent, the re-oxidation of 608 \nreduced sulphur compounds draws the \u03b418O composition of the residual sulphate away 609 \nfrom the equilibrium value and may be extensive enough to reverse the kinetic 610 \nisotopic enrichment of 34S such that there is very little net fractionation of source 611 \nsulphur compounds.  612 \n 613 \n 614 \n 615 \n7. CONCLUSIONS 616 \n 617 \nThere is currently very limited knowledge regarding the historical impacts of 618 \nincreased SO2 emissions from anthropogenic pollution at the local and regional scale. 619 \nHere, stalagmites have been demonstrated to contain sulphur in the form of calcite 620 \nassociated sulphate which can be readily extracted and analysed for \u03b434S-SO4 and \u03b4\n18O-621 \nSO4 signatures. Using the techniques established above, sulphur and oxygen isotope 622 \nmeasurements are conducted using approximately 200 mg of calcite powder 623 \n(equivalent to just 35 \u00b5g of S) to obtain a time series record of sulphur inputs to the 624 \nkarst system. Source partitioning of the constituent sulphate using end-member 625 \nisotopic analysis, sea salt ratios to chloride and bedrock ratios of Ca\/SO4, has 626 \nidentified the dominant component of sulphur at Browns Folly Mine to be of 627 \nanthropogenic origin reflecting the industrial nature of the surrounding region. 628 \nSulphur and oxygen isotope ratios of speleothem CAS at Crag Cave, W. Ireland, 629 \nreflect processes of sulphate reduction along drip water flow paths and are therefore 630 \nunsuitable for directly obtaining atmospheric sulphur records. Thus the potential for 631 \nspeleothems to be used as archives of atmospheric sulphur pollution appears 632 \nencouraging where sediments overlying the cave system are oxidising throughout, as 633 \nmight be expected where thin brown earth soils are found in many temperate and 634 \nMediterranean climate zones. Where stalagmites are fed by drip waters of low redox 635 \nstatus, for example at high latitudes where clay rich tills or peat soils are frequently 636 \nfound, their use as archives of atmospheric sulphur pollution appears limited due to 637 \nthe extensive fractionation associated with processes of sulphate reduction. However, 638 \nuse of sulphate sulphur and oxygen isotopes as indicators of reducing status may have 639 \nimportant implications in future speleothem studies for the interpretation of additional 640 \npalaeoclimatic variables.  At carefully selected cave sites, speleothems hold the 641 \npotential to record short term variability in atmospheric sulphur loading and thereby 642 \nenable an understanding of the local and regional significance of anthropogenic versus 643 \nnatural sulphur aerosols in forcing climatic change. 644 \n 645 \n8.

Values are \ngiven for predominantly anthropogenic sulphate in rain in industrialised countries of the northern hemisphere (range -3 to +9 \u2030; Mayer, \n1998); sulphate aerosol from ocean surface (+21 \u2030; Rees, 1978); marine biogenic emissions as DMS (+15.6 +\/- 3.1 \u2030; Calhoun et al., \n1991); continental and intertidal biogenic emissions (0 to -30 \u2030; Nielson, 1974); volcanic eruptions (~ 0 \u2030; Nielson, 1974). \n \n \n  \n \n \nFigure 2: Diagram showing the two approaches (centrifugation and filtration) to extracting and concentrating sulphate from speleothem calcite \nas barium sulphate prior to \u03b434S and \u03b418O analysis. \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Sulphur concentration, \u03b434S-CAS  and \u03b4\n18O-CAS  in stalagmite BFM-Boss. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Suphur concentration, \u03b434S-CAS  and \u03b4\n18O-CAS  in stalagmite CC-Bil. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Diagram illustrating the range of \u03b434S-CAS and \u03b4\n18O-CAS  in stalagmite BFM-Boss compared to potential sulphate sources.

The range of \nmeasured \u03b434S-CAS and \u03b4\n18O-CAS is distinct compared to other sources of sulphate, suggesting additional sulphur cycling must modify the \ncomposition of the source materials prior to incorporation into stalagmite calcite.
