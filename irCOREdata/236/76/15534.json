For the past two and a half hours she has \njourneyed towards this beach, travelling through a veritable \u2018haath\u2019 (bazaar) of merchant \nvessels at anchor, all of them waiting to enact the same journey. On the beach, towering \nover palm trees, approximately 20 - 25 other vessels, for the most part oil tankers and bulk \ncarriers, lie in varying states of dismemberment. After decades of journeying between ports, \nthe Al Nabila IV has arrived at her final resting place, Sitakunda beach near Chittagong, \nBangladesh, one of the world\u2019s primary locations for ship breaking.1 The skeleton crew - \naccompanied on this occasion by three Bangladeshi researchers - leaves the vessel, \ndescending a steep ladder to a small motorised launch, which transports them to the shore. \nSmoke and the noise of oxyacetylene torches and hand-held hammers fill the air.  \nThousands of men, working for 37 ship breaking yards, are going about the task of breaking \nup these huge fossils, the remainder of the world\u2019s commercial shipping fleet. For the Al \nNabila IV the immediate future will be this: first, workers will strip out all \u2018soft\u2019 items \nincluding furnishings, fixtures and furniture. Then other workers will climb the hull, cutting \noff block sections of metal to fall to the mud flats below, where they will be attached to \ncables by teams of workers and then winched back up the beach, to where yet more \nworkers will cut and hammer them into smaller sections of plate metal. The plates and bars \nwill then be loaded onto trucks by other workers, to be taken a couple of kilometres to \nnearby rerolling mills that provide 90% of all the steel consumed in Bangladesh. And so it \nwill go on, for approximately five months until the Al Nabila IV is literally no more. \n                                                          \n1\n Recent statistics give a clear indication of the global patterns of ship breaking, as well as their connection to \nthe global downturn. A total of 704 commercial ships were scrapped in 2008, the majority of these in \nBangladesh and India. In 2009, Clarkson Research Group reports 1,014 ships were sold for scrapping \u2013 a clear \nindication of the effect of recession on the global shipping fleet. The major destination points for ships \ndestined for scrapping  are India (40%), Bangladesh (21%) and China (17%), with Pakistan and Turkey being \nlesser players in the market (Source: Browne,  2009).   \n 3 \n \n12 kilometres away in Chittagong city, fuelled by a stream of overseas remittances and the \ngrowth of an export-led garment industry, lives an urbanised and increasingly globalised \nBangladeshi middle class. Demand for new urban housing has exploded in this country of \n150 million people, fuelling in turn a construction boom in low rise flats and apartments \nalongside more traditional urban housing. Allied with the boom in construction is a \nburgeoning consumer culture, characterised by global fashion and a taste for modern \ndesigns and home interiors. The new homes need filling and for the Bangladeshi middle \nclasses, as well as a few items of teak furniture that are either handed from generation to \ngeneration or bought as wedding gifts, that means domestic furniture that is increasingly \nmodern in its design, affordable and disposable.     \nThis paper charts the connections between these at first sight unconnected activities and \ntrends, to look at the entanglements of end-of-life ships and middle class homes in \nBangladesh. It traces the connections between ship breaking and middle class domestic \ninteriors, looking at how the one is translated into the other in both material and aesthetic \nregisters. To do so it begins with the literature that has thus far addressed the links between \nconsumer culture and production activities \u2013 studies which have followed Appadurai\u2019s \n(1986) call to follow the things. This literature has cast light on the process of \ncommodification and (de-)fetishisation. However, we suggest it has been limited in its reach, \nstill dominated by what Crewe (2000, page 281) characterised as \u2018food, flowers, fruit and \nfashion\u2019. Moreover, it has been restricted in its conceptualisation of \u2018following\u2019 the things, \nconfining this to movement up the value chain to the point of acquisition by western \nconsumers.  A focus on end-of-life ships brings into relief the commodity\u2019s descent towards \nrubbish value (Thompson, 1979) and disposal (Gregson et al, 2007) and the extended social \nand economic lives of things (Kopytoff, 1986; Gregson and Crewe, 2003). Ships are both \ncommodities in themselves and the conduits for the global flow of goods in commodity \nchains. They enable the movement of things up and down the value chain, in and out of the \ncommodity phase, and between geographically differentiated value regimes. Literally, then, \nto \u2018follow the thing\u2019 through commodity chains means that research should be following \nships. And if commodities have biographies and lives, then so too do the ships that transport \nthem.  Eventually, however, ships are sent to their demise, when the scrap value of their \n 4 \n \nconstituent materials outweighs the costs of maintaining them. Yet following end-of-life \nships to the point of their demise flags-up that ships are not just singular objects but \nsimultaneously multiple, heterogeneous things and materials. Drawing on ethnographic \nresearch conducted in Sitakunda, Bhatiary and Chittagong, Bangladesh, the paper shows \nhow the demise of end-of-life ships is marked by their morphing through two inter-\nconnected and geographically proximate sites of translation which epitomise what Hawkins \n(2006) calls the arts of transience, working with the mutability of things. The destructive \nlabour of ship breaking on a beach at Sitakunda is shown to create a range of objects and \ndifferentiated streams of material which form the basis for secondary manufacturing, craft \nand retail activities in Bhatiary. The resultant products are subsequently distributed through \nBangladesh\u2019s major cities, homes and workplaces. Taking the domestic as our focus in this \npaper, we show how furniture derived from ship breaking and revalorised through \nsecondary manufacturing, craft and retail activities is appropriated in the homes of the \nBangladeshi middle classes, with an empirical focus on Chittagong. The paper concludes by \nposing some key challenges for research that traces commodity flows, both from within the \n\u2018follow the thing\u2019 frame and from a vital materialist perspective, and by highlighting that the \nmaterial potentialities of the arts of transience are not always positive. We close the paper \ntherefore with a bitter twist, showing that reuse, recycling and re-manufacturing can have \ndeleterious consequences.  \n2: Following things \u2013  a critique \nThe links drawn between spatially distinctive yet temporally coincident activities linking \nconsumers with producers are ones forged typically through approaches that are \ncharacterised as \u2018following the things\u2019. Originally this approach aimed to defetishise \ncommodities through the political project of connecting (western) consumers with \nunknown, unseen and unheard producers in (often far away) lands. That origin is clear when \nIan Cook reflects on Shelley Sacks exhibition Exchange Values, where a gallery of banana \nskins exported from the Caribbean to the West was surrounded headphones playing the \nstories of the producers, explaining how demands for cheap produce, powerful \nsupermarkets and intermediaries drive down their standard of living. The power of that \ntestimony moved him to wonder: \n 5 \n \n\u2018Suppose you went to a supermarket before opening time. Switched on the food. \nAnd could hear whispering like this. Suppose you could pick things off the shelf, put \nthem to your ear and listen to the people who had helped to get them there talking \nto you. What would they say and ask?\u2019(Cook and et al., 2006, pages 655-6) \nIn recent years, this approach has been applied and developed in relation to a range of \ncommodities, including papaya, hot pepper sauce, denim jeans, fashion clothing, cut \nflowers, chewing gum, rubber, chicken, sugar, wine and tourist souvenirs (Cook et al, 2004; \nCook and Harrison, 2007; Cook et al., 2007; Dwyer and Jackson, 2003; Kleine, 2008; Long \nand Villareal, 1999; Ramsay, 2009). Although focusing on very different products, these \nstudies of the \u2018geographical lives of commodities\u2019 (Castree, 2001) all track back through the \nassembling of a pre-figured point of sale commodity and\/or commodities. \u2018Following\u2019 \ntherefore is conducted either literally along the supply chains, to the point of realisation of \nthe commodity in its final form through acquisition at the point of sale, or is distributed over \na web of supply chains connecting networks of producers, buyers, technicians, product \ndesigners, retailers and consumers. The ethnographic vignette with which we began this \npaper, however, does not fit this frame. Rubbish ships, like the Al Nabila IV, are not being \npassed along a series of sites intact or even attracting symbolic layering and meanings on \ntheir way to becoming a final commodity. Rather, they are being unmade; stripped of \nsymbolic associations (their names, their histories), they are not coming together but are \nbeing scattered into smaller parts. The work is destructive. It is about the labour of breaking \nthings up, not putting them together (Gregson et al 2010).  \nTo date, research on \u2018following the things\u2019 has not addressed the back-end of the value \nchain, or indeed any activity beyond the initial consumer. In this respect, it has close \naffinities with material culture\u2019s neglect of the social and physical death of things \n(Colloredo-Mansfield , 2003; Dant, 2005). This is a surprising omission, given the inclusion of \na key chapter by Igor Kopytoff in Appadurai\u2019s influential collection, and the insistence \ntherein that goods move in and out of the commodity phase, and that they have extended \nsocial and economic lives. Where extended lives have been addressed within geography, \nthis has largely been in terms of constituting the home \u2013 especially \u2018the material cultures of \nobjects and their use, display and meanings within the home\u2019 (Blunt, 2005, page 506; Leslie \n 6 \n \nand Reimer, 2003) \u2013 where the linkage of products and practices is seen as what \nconsumption actually involves (Shove and Southerton, 2000; Warde, 2005; Watson and \nShove, 2008). The thing is occasionally followed into the domestic world, but rarely beyond \nit, in spite of the emerging work on second-hand exchange, consumption and disposal \n(Gregson and Crewe, 2003; Clarke, 2000; Gregson et al, 2007a, 2007b; Reno, 2009). Taking \nits inspiration from both Kopytoff and Thompson, this latter work rests on a reading of \nconsumption that emphasises not the realisation of value in the initial point of sale but \ncombines the senses of consumption as practice or making use with the material \netymological sense of consumption as depletion, exhaustion and using-up, and as \nintrinsically linked to ridding, disposal and wasting (Hetherington, 2004; Gregson, 2007; \nO\u2019Brien, 2008). \u2018Following\u2019 for this approach does not end with the western consumer. \nRather, the western consumer, and for that matter the western home, is but one moment in \nthe circulation of goods. Discarded consumer goods become captured within other \nnetworks which work to move them eventually either to sites of secondary processing, \ntreatment and revaluation, often in Africa, India or China, or to sites of \u2018disposal\u2019 such as the \nlandfills and incinerators of western Europe or the dumps of Africa and China (BAN, 2002, \n2005). Thus, discarded clothing, consumer durables, electronic goods, paper and plastic, \nmove to West Africa (European Environment Agency, 2009; Tranberg Hansen, 2000), \nSouthern China (Iles, 2004; Lepawsky and McNabb, forthcoming; Tong and Wang, 2004) and \nSouth and North India, there to be \u2018recycled\u2019 into yet further commodities (Norris, 2004a, \n2004b), many of which will return in another guise to be purchased by western consumers.    \nAlong with its neglect of the back-end of the value chain, to date \u2018following the things\u2019 \nresearch has concentrated on a relatively narrow range of commodities \u2013 mostly food and \nfashion \u2013 primarily sold in western consumer markets. As noted above, this approach \noriginated in efforts to counter commodity fetishism and has clear connections with the \npolitics of ethical trade and consumption. Work in this vein has moved from an initial \nimpetus to make the production chain transparent, and a tendency to have the clear-\nsighted analyst guide us from guilty consumption to exploited producer, to more creatively \ncritical fetishisms (Foster, 2006, page 286) that, in Taussig\u2019s phrase, \u2018get with the fetish\u2019 to \nrework it (Cook 2006, page 658).  Nonetheless, it is characterised by at least four problems. \n 7 \n \nThe first problem has been a tendency to position those in the global south solely as \nproducers supporting corporately driven flows, rather than as multiply entangled \u2013 as \nconsumers and instigators \u2013 in flows that have more diverse paths and connections \n(Raghuram, 2004, pp 121 \u2013 4; Wilk, 2006). A second problem is the emphasis placed on \nwestern consumption and western consumers. This neglects the burgeoning consumer \ncultures of India, China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan, to take just some of the most \nobvious examples (Brewer and Trentmann, 2006; Chua, 2000; Clammer, 1997, 2003). But a \nfurther implication is that a highly particular pattern of consumption and type of (western) \nconsumer comes to stand for a universal consumer and consumption. A third problem, \nfollowing the thing tends to focus attention upon objects that become successfully \nstabilised. A fourth, and consequent, problem is that a vast range of intermediary things \nthat are consumed in production and circulation -- from packaging to off-cuts to energy to, \nindeed, ships -- become subsumed within, maybe obscured by, final commodities.  \nShips are both the glue and grease of the global economy and of globalisation, whilst the \nshipping industry is often represented as an exemplar case of a global industry and \ntransnational workforce (ILO, 2004; Sampson and Bloor, 2007). The contemporary merchant \nvessel, combined with the technology of the big box container, is the means by which most \ncommodities move around the world \u2013 although its central role and those of maritime \nspaces is all too often overlooked (Sekula, 1995: Levinson, 2006). But ships too are also \ncommodities and, like all commodities, they move in and out of the commodity phase, as \nwell as shift through value regimes. In the case of ships a commercial life, which is likely to \nbe 25 \u2013 32 years, will include periodic refits and probably progressive downgrading in terms \nof capacities, profitability and value. The Al Nabila IV with which we began this paper, \nhowever, is a ship of rubbish value. Rubbish value ships are offered for sale in the shipping \nindustry\u2019s demolition market. In this case the vessel will have been purchased by \n\u2018Bangladeshi interests\u2019 \u2013 not for its use and exchange value as a ship but for materials,  \nprimarily thousands of tons of steel scrap. In the demolition market, the Al Nabila IV is \nvalued not as an object but in terms of its \u201clight weight tonnage\u201d, that is as weight in \nmaterials. Indeed, price will have depended on estimated valuations of materials and how \neasy they are to extract through breaking and then open to revaluation.  \n 8 \n \nPaying attention to things like the Al Nabila IV highlights the material potentiality in things \nin ways that many current accounts of \u2018following the things\u2019 obscure. For all its capacity to \nattend to the distributed qualities of assembling things, \u2018following the things\u2019 research \nstabilises and condenses things, freezing them in the still life that is the object of the point \nof sale commodity, or \u2013 more rarely \u2013 in the lives of these objects with consumers.  While \nwork on food products has attended to their specific material affordances (e.g. Stassart and \nWhatmore, 2003), the product is rarely materially unravelled or recombined. Looking at the \nback-end of the value chain and at commodities of rubbish value does not merely extend \nthe following of things over more of their social and economic lives. It is more profound \nthan this. For what it does is to destabilise the thing itself. It shows that the thing is multiple, \nmutable and material; and that the thing and the commodity are but moments in the \ncirculation and assembling of material. We come back to this point in our conclusion. Before \nthis, we highlight the complexities and entanglements of mutable things deemed of rubbish \nvalue. Having arrived at Sitakunda beach, Bangladesh, the Al Nabila IV has entered a \ncomplex, integrated site of object demolition, materials separation and segregation, re-use \nand secondary manufacturing, centred on the district of Bhatiary ( Figure 1). \n Figure 1 about here \n \nIn the following section we trace some of the material transformations and translations \ninvolved in this site. The constituents of the ships move through this complex in many \ndirections. Thus, steel plate from the ships provides 90% of the steel used in Bangladesh and \nis turned into reinforcing rods for the concrete making the new houses and apartments \nspringing up in Bangladeshi cities; ship chandlery is resold to equip the coastal fishing fleet; \nand electric motors and components are reconditioned and sold to land-based industries \nwith, for instance, ships\u2019 boilers and compressors being used in dyeing fabric and generators \nto power the factories producing garments for the clothes export sector. Indeed the proud \nboast of the industry is that 99% of an end-of-life ship is \u2018recycled\u2019. Given their connections \nto the home, to domestic consumption and to consumers, it is what was once the \ndesiderata of the trade \u2013 the furnishings and how they have come to permeate Bangladeshi \nconsumer culture \u2013 that are the most pertinent things to follow in this instance and for  the \n 9 \n \ndevelopment of debates on following the thing. Our empirical focus in the paper therefore \nis on the furniture shops of Bhatiary, the transformations they effect, and the appropriation \nof ship breaking furniture by the Bangladeshi middle classes.   \n \n3: Sites of translation, transformation and re-valuation  \n3.1: The furniture businesses of Bhatiary: a tale of rubbish turned to value  \nBhatiary could be dubbed \u2018recycling city\u2019. Since the mid 1980s, hundreds of shops have \nsprung up till they now stretch from Chittagong City Gate some 9 km to Sitakunda and \nSitalpur. The shops line the Dhaka-Chittagong highway, the main trunk road in Bangladesh. \nThey sell almost everything, from lifeboats to kitchen sinks and cooking equipment, from \nwestern toilets to gym equipment and generators. More recently, a further spin-off has \nevolved in Chittagong city, specialising in electronics and consumer durables. The supply \nchain of all these business depends upon the ship breaking industry on the beach.  \nOriginally these shops were a means of simply disposing of the sundry, unvalued soft goods \nof the ships. Pioneer sellers tell stories from the early 1980s of \u2018poor people collecting \nleftover materials from the yards and selling them by the roadside\u2019; of \u2018local people \nscavenging and making fences out of ship breaking board or of using it as firewood\u2019; and of \nship breakers chucking board on the beach as they broke up their ships. Scavenging and \nwasting are central to the narratives of the early pioneers in the business. The pioneers \nportray themselves as doing a favour to the ship breaking businesses, through taking \nunwanted materials off their hands. 2 In such narratives, ship breakers are depicted as \nseeing no value in furniture, fixtures and fittings, whilst the self-positioning of the furniture \npioneers is as the heroic agents of salvage. \u2018Please release me from this burden\u2019 is a phrase \ncommonly attributed by pioneer furniture makers to the ship breakers, along with \u2018at that \ntime this stuff was nothing but trouble for them, they just wanted to get rid of it\u2019. In their \nself-narrative, the furniture makers identify themselves as having seen the scope for \n                                                          \n2\n A field survey conducted for the this project visited every second-hand outlet in Bhatiary in the course of \n2008, documenting location, products, reprocessing, ownerships, alliances and employment and interviewing \nmany owners. \n 10 \n \nentrepreneurial activities without having the capital to enter the breaking business itself. \nIndeed, some early innovators moved from supplying workers to break up ships to owning \nworkshops processing their fittings. Nowadays, the major furniture businesses send agents \naboard the ships and the ship breakers organise auctions for the contents. \nWhilst initially retailers would sell goods \u2018as-is\u2019, that is in the condition in which they came \nfrom the ships, the furniture sector has grown though moving into repair, renovation, \nreconditioning and re-fabrication work. There are currently 72 furniture units in Bhatiary \n(2008 survey data), owned by 22 partnerships or individuals. Almost all of these shops have \na refurbishment facility attached. This may vary from such simple actions as providing backs \nfor cupboards no longer bolted to ship bulkheads, through to recovering soft furnishings but \nincreasingly it means taking only the carcass of furnishings or boards as raw materials to \nproduce almost entirely new products.  The larger enterprises employ between 30-40 \npeople each, all of them male, working in the full range of carpentry and furniture making \nskills \u2013 cutting board, constructing frames, doing joinery, gluing, upholstering, a-fixing \nsurface materials (notably Formica - see Figure 2)), patterning and polishing, as well as \nselling.  \n \n Figure 2 about here \nThe workers in these refurbishing workshops are all either skilled craftsmen or akin to \napprentices learning their trades. Most are migrant workers from Chandpur and Noakhali \ndistricts, and are typically recruited through kinship networks. Their jobs, indeed the \nlivelihoods of all those working in the furniture sector in Bhatiary (estimated at 10,000, 2008 \nsurvey data), are dependent upon a steady supply of board and wood from the ship \nbreaking yards, and therefore a constant flow of ships being broken. Neither can be \nassumed. The ship breaking industry in Bangladesh is increasingly subject to overt \nchallenges, both for the environmental degradation the industry causes and for its labour \nconditions (Cairns, 2007; Greenpeace, 2005; Hossain and Islam, 2006; YPSA, 2005). \nFurthermore, the industry is entirely dependent upon a supply of ships for demolition which  \nis a mirror image of the peaks and troughs of global trade.  \n 11 \n \nThe supply chain to the furniture shops is itself controlled by the one-third of the furniture \nsector able to muster both the finances and the skills to bid on an increasingly differentiated \nset of lots sold by the ship breakers. Effectively, as the furniture sector has grown and \nbecome more successful, so too has its complexity, its commercial sophistication and its \ndivision of labour. Indeed, the major sellers all have bidding specialists and financial \npartners alongside the more traditional furniture and refurbishment specialists, and all sell a \nvariety of board, wood and leftover wood scrap within the construction and building trade \nas well as to other furniture businesses in Bhatiary.  \nTo transform the board and fittings from rubbish into a once more valuable commodity \nrequired more than carpentry skills. It required a market of consumers. Initially local \nunderstandings of ship breaking furniture, based on its opportunistic use as fencing or its \nabandonment by the roadside, dumped on the beach or in drains, emphasised its seeming \npoor quality and lack of durability. Added to this were local myths about the water-proof \nnature of ship furniture, leading to misuse, and also design anomalies that came from items \nbeing originally incorporated into the structure and fabric of the ship itself. Transferred to \nland, such furniture lacks many of the design features (such as backs) that are taken-for-\ngranted in domestic furniture. Add to that their used condition, compounded by a lack of \ncare devoted to the furniture\u2019s removal, and such items were never going to be easy to sell \nto the Bangladeshi middle classes for use in their homes. Indeed, even to sell them at all \nrequired that the incipient furniture businesses develop repair and refurbishment facilities.  \nFor the approximately 45% of the Bangladeshi population in absolute poverty, furniture of \nthe type discussed in this paper is an irrelevance. For the remaining 55% however, \ncomprising the middle classes and elite, it came to offer new possibilities. Prior to the \nadvent of the ship breaking furniture sector, furniture in Bangladesh equated to teak. \nExpensive, extremely durable, handed down through the generations and also purchased \nfor wedding gifts, teak furniture conveyed, and continues to convey, social status and \nstanding in Bangladesh. Increasing scarcity and extremely high prices, however, provided an \nopening in the market for a different type of furniture. It is this gap that the incipient \nfurniture businesses spotted and exploited. Selling their initial goods through a \u2018try it and \nsee how you get on with it\u2019 narrative, they found that consumers began to value their \u2018new\u2019 \n 12 \n \nfurniture precisely because of how it stood in opposition to teak. Thus, as we show in the \nnext section, ship breaking furniture came to be valued because it was cheap (compared to \nteak), and because \u2013 whilst it was durable \u2013 it could also (and unlike teak) be discarded, \nprecisely because it was cheap and of less value. Ship breaking furniture therefore could be \ngiven away to relatives, left behind if one moved, and thrown away if it broke. Its value, \nthen, was in its transience as well as its price, and in the way it fitted in with the lives of an \nincreasingly mobile Bangladeshi middle class.  \nFrom the late 1990s, the market has moved into a new phase related to the rise of \ninternational-style branded furniture appealing to a more modern, more self-consciously \ndesigned aesthetic. Most prominently, the Otobi brand in particular appealed to younger \ntastes, refracted through a spatial imaginary of \u2018international\u2019 style whose putative globality \nboth reflected and restated widening Bangladeshi middle class horizons. Furnishings here \nare infused with a complex mix of national and global signifiers, or better, nationally \nunderstood signifiers of globality (Reimer and Leslie, 2008). Larger firms, such as Sun \nFurniture House,3 provide an exemplar case of how the ship breaking furniture sector has \nbeen able to domesticate this aesthetic, utilising Formica and glue to create a desirable \n\u2018Mock Otobi\u2019 for a large number of lower middle class consumers (see Figure 3).  \n \n Figure 3 about here \nSun Furniture House\u2019s entry into the ship breaking furniture business in the mid 1990s was \ninitially shaky. The owner of the business Mr Abdul Alim, tells the story of how his \ncompany\u2019s use of Formica was originally decried by the other businesses which relied more \non traditional carpentry and polishing skills, as well as on upholstering skills, to revalorise \nboards and frames. Formica, however, enabled Sun Furniture to cover over the blemishes \nand marks of wear on ship breaking furniture, to present it as shiny and new -- in local \nparlance \u2018chock-chocky\u2019 (see figure 4). With Formica\u2019s surfaces capable of being produced in \neither matt or glossy finishes, and with myriad patterns, Sun Furniture now generates \n                                                          \n3\n All names are pseudonyms. \n 13 \n \nbespoke orders from Chittagong\u2019s lower middle class who desire, yet cannot afford, Otobi. \nWhile Sun Furniture\u2019s \u2018Mock Otobi\u2019 \u2018chock chocky\u2019 may have started as an affordable \nalternative it has now grown into a new ship breaking furniture brand with its own cachet, \nand its products are widely distributed throughout Bangladesh via wholesalers, retailing in \nFeni, Sylhet, Rajshahi and Noakhali.  \n Figure 4 about here \nThe furniture shops and allied refurbishment workshops of Bhatiary show clearly how \nleftover, discarded goods declared to be of rubbish value by ship breakers were captured, \ntransformed and revalorised. They show too how this revalorisation is dependent upon \ncreating markets for new products. That the furniture businesses of Bhatiary have been so \nsuccessful in this regard is in no small part down to having fabricated and re-commodified \ngoods whose value lies in their difference from other goods, particularly teak. Yet other \nbusinesses within the sector have shown themselves equally able to adjust to the \ncompetition posed by new brands in the market, by reproducing the copy more cheaply.  \n3.2: Ship breaking furniture in the homes of the Bangladeshi middle class \nHaving discussed how the Bhatiary furniture businesses revalorise the wastes of the ship \nbreaking businesses, we turn in this section to consider how these items are appropriated \nby Bangladeshi middle class consumers. We draw here on 39 interviews with householders, \nconducted in Bengali, spread across the middle classes, and present three households as \nexemplar cases. All of the households live in Chittagong City and they were recruited \nthrough social networks and snowballing methods.4 \n                                                          \n4\n Methodological note: The fieldwork here involved 2 local female field assistants without whom access to \nBangladeshi homes would have been impossible. Initial plans to \u2018follow the things\u2019 from shops, even those \nwith whom we had good relations, foundered both due to the difficulties of contacting buyers in the shops or \nexplaining our purposes in subsequent phone calls.  The process of recruitment was not easy, hampered at \nmany stages from the reticence of many shopkeepers to divulge details of their consumers, and then, where \nwe did have details on customers, the rapid turnover of residence and contact phone details made contact \ndifficult. If contact was made the suspicions of many consumers (that the research was to do with NGOs trying \nto shut down ship breaking, that it was a subterfuge to contact women, or to gain entry to the home for \nnefarious purposes, that it was to do with taxation or the then military regime) meant gaining consent for an \ninterview was often difficult and then finally, even if the respondent was willing to participate, finding the \nresidences, given the lack of any definitive street map of the rapidly growing Chittagong, was something of a \n 14 \n \nMrs S is a widow in her mid fifties living with one of her elder daughters and her family in a \none-storey small rented house in the Noia Bazar area on the outskirts of Chittagong City. \nThe house comprises two rooms alongside a kitchen and bathroom. The front room acts as a \nliving\/bedroom with the other being the main bedroom. Space is at a premium in this home, \nyet it is crammed full of furniture \u2013 to the extent that it is almost impossible to move. In the \nbedroom, aside from a teak bed which was her daughter\u2019s wedding gift, there is an \nupholstered sofa, a steel clothes rack and a wooden chair. In the main room is a second \nmatching upholstered sofa, a bed-cum-sitting area, a small table and a cupboard\/chest, on \nwhich stands a TV. All this furniture, with the exception of the teak bed, is ship breaking \nfurniture purchased in Bhatiary. Much of this furniture was purchased relatively recently. \nMrs S bought the second bed two years ago, in part on the advice of her neighbour who \nstressed the competitive prices to be found in Bhatiary, and has bought all the rest \nsubsequently. Mrs S talks about this furniture in ways which emphasise the multiple ways \nshe values these items: in terms of affordability, as a worthy substitute for the unobtainable \n(teak), as fashionable, as varied in design and as well made. She says:  \n\u2018It is very good and cherished by us *...+ (it) is within the range of our ability and \naffordability. We can\u2019t buy teak furniture so it is very beautiful and attractive to us. \nPeople like us are basically the lower income group and the only option is ship \nbreaking furniture both for design and by necessity\u2019.  \nShe thus makes a \u2018choice of the necessary\u2019 in Bourdieu\u2019s felicitous phrase (1984, page 372). \nNevertheless, she emphasises  \n\u2018there is a big difference between today\u2019s products and previously. Ship breaking \nfurniture used to look second hand but the way it is made nowadays in Bhatiary with \nFormica and other materials is far better. Last year when I went to Bhatiary to \n                                                                                                                                                                                    \nchallenge. Thus the most successful interview recruitment technique was to work by snowballing, building \nfrom contacts in identifiable fractions of the middle class. Within Bangladesh, the expansion of service sector \nemployment, increasing remittances, and a trend towards entrepreneurship and self- employment have \ncreated a new middle-income strata. A distinction between upper and lower middle class is widely recognised \nin popular parlance, and reflects the wide range of incomes from 7000 to 50000 taka monthly (around \u00a365 to \n\u00a3500). As we show in this section, more fine-grained differentiations are embodied, expressed and recursively \nproduced through consumer cultures.  \n 15 \n \npurchase this sofa set I was really impressed to see all the different designs and that \nmany of these items are chock-chocky\u2019.  \nMrs K is mid thirties and a school teacher. She has one child and her husband works for a \nprivate company. They live in a two bedroom flat in Agrabad, a middle class residential \nneighbourhood close to the financial and business quarter in Chittagong City. The flat has a \nliving room, a dining room, a master bedroom, children\u2019s bedroom and two toilets. Mrs K is \nfrom Dhaka originally and the couple moved to Chittagong shortly after their marriage, nine \nyears ago. They started their married lives in a small one-bedroom flat, similar to the \nprevious case study. Initially they had no furniture for the flat. A friend told them about \nBhatiary, where the furniture was both ready-made, ready to take away and also reasonably \npriced. Mrs K explains:  \n\u2018When we went there for the first time we were so surprised to see that the whole \nof Bhatiary area is full of ship breaking furniture and the price was so reasonable. It \nwas really helpful for us to start a new life as a newly married couple with only my \nhusband earning. First, we bought one bed and one wardrobe which were essential \nitems and desperately needed by us. Afterwards we also bought a dining table and \nsofa set \u2013 I really liked the furniture\u2019.  \nToday Mrs K\u2019s home has a mix of ship breaking furniture and new international style \nfurniture and furnishings, including some items from Otobi and some teak. The main living \nroom includes a large sofa in blue, gold and pink cloth, an ornamental table and an \nemergency bed for guest use. The master bedroom includes a teak bed, a chest of drawers \nfrom Bhatiary, and two pieces of Otobi furniture \u2013 a wardrobe and a dressing table\/mirror. \nThe dining room however still contains the same oval, formal dining table and set of chairs, \npurchased \u2018as is\u2019 in Bhatiary when they were first married.  \nIt is instructive to compare how Mrs K talks about ship breaking furniture now compared to \nearlier on in her life. Acknowledging the impossibility of purchasing any other type of \nfurniture as \u2018newly-weds\u2019, she now sees this furniture as \u2018cost effective but not fashionable\u2019. \nIndeed, whereas for Mrs S, \u2018chock-chocky\u2019 connotes a stylish aesthetic, for Mrs K it is not. \nFor her, using Formica has lowered the quality of the product, impacting negatively on its \n 16 \n \nappearance. She says: \u2018The glossiness of the Formica or the covering fabric of the sofas is \nvery bright which I feel is less sophisticated\u2019.  \nThe changing consumption of ship breaking furniture within Mrs K\u2019s home over the years \nilluminates the ambiguities of ship breaking furniture within the taste registers of the \nBangladeshi middle classes. For Mrs K, furniture is understood to convey social status and \nstanding. Ship breaking furniture is problematically, even negatively, positioned in relation \nto social status. Thus, \u2018chock-chocky\u2019 is too brash, or too \u2018loud\u2019 (to use an English \ntranslation). It is a marker of a lack of sophistication. In another sense, ship breaking \nfurniture is understood here as \u2018second-hand\u2019, in its negative sense. As a consequence, in \nMrs K\u2019s current home certain items of ship breaking furniture have been relegated to the \nprivate areas of the house where taste matters less \u2013 notably a child\u2019s bedroom \u2013 and \nreplaced with objects that accord with different, assumed to be more modern, taste \naesthetics. Paradoxically confirming this class aesthetic, however, another item of ship \nbreaking furniture \u2013 the \u2018as is\u2019 dining room table and chairs \u2013 is proudly displayed in another \npublic room. It is \u2018unadulterated\u2019 and high quality original furniture. The confines of Mrs K\u2019s \nflat therefore contain a conjuncture and collision of taste registers in which ship breaking \nfurniture is multiply positioned.  \nMr J is an engineer in a mobile phone company who lives in Sarsen Road -- a well known \naffluent neighbourhood in Chittagong City. He is in his forties and lives in a gated complex of \nluxurious rented apartments with his wife and two children, and is one of a large number of \nBangladeshi return migrants. In his case he spent some years working in Canada. Prior to \nthis, and before he married, Mr J\u2019s furniture came exclusively from Bhatiary. This furniture \nwas left in situ when the family went to Canada but, on their return, and move to Sarsen \nRoad, the family sent the vast majority to relatives in the \u2018village home\u2019. They then filled \ntheir new home with entirely new furniture, the majority of it teak. Ironically they thus sent \nthe \u2018modern\u2019 furniture to be valued in the \u2018traditional\u2019 village, while as modern urbanites \nthey bought \u2018traditional\u2019 forms.5 Whilst his wife regards Bengali teak furniture as highly \n                                                          \n5\n It is important to flag that the valorisation of the traditional aesthetic, even its reproduction as commodified \ntypes, has echoes across Bengal and often carries a gendered charge about who are the protectors of tradition \n(Nag, 1991). Such wider patterns are beyond the scope of this paper, as are interesting comparisons with \nhomes, objects and memories in the South Asian diaspora (Tolia-Kelly, 2004a, 2004b).  \n 17 \n \ndesirable and authentic, Mr J continues to value ship breaking furniture for its durability and \nlasting qualities. He maintains that home aesthetics are unconnected with brands or prices \nbut that what matters instead is the order and maintenance of interiors. For him the home \nis less about exactly what is put in it and the status such items allegedly confer, and rather \nmore about the arrangement and conjunctures of things. He says: \u2018Home is a natural nest. It \nhas to be well organised and well arranged\u2019. Unusually for a man in his position, he is \npositively disposed towards ship breaking furniture, saying: \u2018I do not feel shy about showing \npeople that I have ship breaking furniture; [ ... ] I even encourage people to use ship \nbreaking furniture\u2019. Nonetheless, the flat contains just one item of ship breaking furniture, a \nreading table in his daughter\u2019s bedroom, in which all the other items are teak. Elsewhere, \nthe furniture in all the public rooms is teak, whilst his son\u2019s room is furnished exclusively \nwith Otobi originals, a response to the taste demands of the son\u2019s generation.  \nThe almost total absence of ship breaking furniture and the conspicuous presence of teak \nand Otobi in Mr J\u2019s home are indicative of the entanglement of value, brand and material \nculture in the homes of the Bangladeshi middle classes. Here, in the upper echelons of this \nsocial class, where authenticity is affordable, it is materialised, through the historically \ntraditional form of teak or in the modern designs of Otobi. Ship breaking furniture, whilst \nvalued rhetorically and remembered nostalgically, has no place in this aesthetic register, \neither as the copy or in its refurbished form. Physically and aesthetically it is of rubbish value \nin the milieu of Sarsen Road, albeit that its potential for revaluation in other settings is still \nacknowledged  \u2013 bundled onto a truck or motorised rickshaw it passes into another value \nregime centred on the rural economy and rural livelihoods.6  \nAt one level the households discussed above provide yet further testimony to the cross-\ncultural purchase of Bourdieu\u2019s (1984) arguments about the interplay of distinction and \ntaste. In the homes of the Bangladeshi middle classes distinction is inflected through the \nlogics of affordability and necessity, convenience and availability, as well as aesthetic \n                                                          \n6\n Alternative conduits for the disposal of unwanted ship breaking furniture are typical of the hand-me-\ndown\/around social economy and include giving things to waged domestic workers (commonly employed by \nthe Bangladeshi middle class) and to second-hand shops, as well as abandoning things in public space, where \nthey may be salvaged.  \n 18 \n \nregisters. Registers and logics conjoin to generate distinctive tastes and immediately \nrecognisable types of domestic interior. For the lower middle classes, domestic space is \nproduced through a taste of necessity. Here just having and possessing furniture works to \nmark a critical distinction, the separation from poverty. When allied with the affordability of \nship breaking furniture, possession works to valorise an interior stuffed to capacity with ship \nbreaking furniture (Figure 5). Having furniture morphs to having domestic space crammed \nfull of furniture. At the same time, it is the bright, shiny, glossy surface qualities of \u2018chock-\nchocky\u2019 that are valued here. In contrast, it is precisely those qualities (\u2018chock-chocky\u2019) \nwhich are regarded with disdain by other fractions of the Bangladeshi middle class, for \nwhom \u2018chock-chocky\u2019 ship breaking furniture is seen to be poorly made, inauthentic and the \nhallmark of bad taste. In their homes what matters is authenticity, understood in terms of \neither materials (teak) or design (modern, international brands). Thus, whilst teak continues \nto be highly sought after, to predominate in the homes of the upper middle class and the \nelite, and to be the prevailing wedding gift of choice, modern design aesthetics are being \nincreasingly adopted by younger people. Valuing \u2018brand\u2019 over indigenous materiality, this \ndistinction is a generational one which points to the rise of global consumer cultures \namongst the younger Bangladeshi middle class.  \n \n Figure 5 about here \nThe broad contours of how distinction and taste work themselves out in the context of the \nBangladeshi middle class will be familiar enough to those conversant with consumption \ndebates. Of greater interest, however, is that ship breaking furniture continues to be valued \nby the upper echelons of the middle class, as a generic type if not as an actual physical \npresence. In part this value is predicated upon absence, nostalgia and memory. Thus, whilst \nfor some of the middle class ship breaking furniture is an ambivalent accommodation, for \nothers it works as both a marker of social progress and social mobility and as fondly \nremembered, but no longer present, pieces of material culture that marked the start of \nmarried life and the first family home. Running alongside this is a value grounded in \ndisposability. That ship breaking furniture can be discarded, and that it is disposed of \nthrough intra-familial gifting and the hand-me-down\/hand-around social economy is a \n 19 \n \nmeasure of its social worth. To be able to gift furniture in a country where 40% of the \npopulation are without furniture, and to be able to place this furniture with poor relations \nliving in rural areas, is both open to notions of care and responsibility towards family (or \nknown others) and simultaneously a means of registering in a highly material way the social \nmobility of family members.  \nRead thus, ship breaking furniture begins to emerge as a type of furniture whose value lies \nin that it can be whatever the consumer wants it to be: a beautiful substitute for the \nunattainable (teak), as offering comfort and convenience, as fashionable, as a nostalgic \nmemory, as disposable, as conferring of generosity and care. Such mutability in meaning is, \nwe suggest, intimately linked to the conditions of the furniture\u2019s production and the infinite \nvariety of its form. Ship breaking furniture is not often second-hand furniture. The vast bulk \nof this furniture is fabricated from materials leftover from the process of object destruction \nand steel scrap recovery that goes on on Sitakunda beach. Built on \u2018wastes\u2019 and materials \nrather than objects, Bhatiary\u2019s furniture businesses are an instance of secondary \nmanufacturing and founded on imagining and fabricating these materials into objects and \ncommodities that resonate with the aesthetic tastes of the Bangladeshi middle classes. As \nsuch, these businesses have the capacity to endlessly reinvent their products, to keep \nproducing \u2018chock-chocky\u2019 and to produce the cheaper copy that looks just as new. These \nbusinesses matter to broader debates precisely because, in their appeal to a large, \nguaranteed market of lower middle class consumers across Bangladesh, they show that \nrubbish dumped on a beach can be reclaimed and re-valued; that the arts of transience can \nindeed turn \u2018waste\u2019 into value.   \n4: Conclusions  \nOur concern in this paper has been with things at the back-end of the value chain, things \ndeemed to be of rubbish value. The paper shows clearly Thompson\u2019s point, that rubbish is \nno end point but rather a fulcrum point and that the arts of transience are critical to \nrekindling value. Nonetheless, where the paper departs from previous work, and from other \nresearch on second-hand exchange and consumption, as well as from cultural work on \nsalvage (Soderan and Carter, 2008), is in its departure from a focus on a stable object of \ndevaluation and revalorisation. The dismembered objects on Sitakunda beach testify to \n 20 \n \nrubbish value\u2019s connection to the material, its properties and capacities. Here, on this \nbeach, the temporal and physical limits of particular object forms and configurations of \nmaterial have been reached. As forms they no longer have any value. Rather, at this point, \ntheir value is not as a thing but a function of their materialities and their ability to multiply \nand mutate. The ships cease to be vessels but revert to being thousands of tons of scrap \nsteel and more. To stop seeing objects and to see them as conjunctures of materials \nrequires a gestalt shift. The social sciences customarily focus upon objects \u2013 be that in \nmaterial culture studies, museum studies, consumption research, as well as for research \nthat has followed the things.  A focus on end-of-life objects, however, insists on seeing that \nthings are assemblages, ontological conjunctures of stuff, materials, brought together and \nheld together, but also coming apart and wrenched asunder. \nThe implications of this focus and these arguments for following the things research are \nconsiderable. Two points are particularly noteworthy. The first is that in confining attention \nto movement up the value chain, such work has both truncated the temporally and \ngeographically extended lives of things and neglected that things travel down, as well as up, \nthe value chain. Bangladesh is but one destination for rubbish value ships; India, China and \nPakistan are others. Other end-of-life consumer goods display similar geographies. The work \nof NGOs in particular has been critical to exposing the environmental and labour \nconsequences of such traffic in things, but the full implications of these flows remain to be \ntaken up by geographers interested in commodity chains, whose attention remains \nprimarily with the production of point of sale commodities consumed by western \nconsumers. A second point follows on. This is that in paying attention to point of sale \ncommodities, following the things research works to stabilise things in the still life of the \nobject form. This stabilises the object by stilling material and placing it utterly at the \ncommand of capital. Flatter ontological perspectives such as vital materialism acknowledge \nthat it takes much to hold things together and that material is both agentic and \nperformative (Barad, 2007; Bennett, 2001, 2004, 2007; Mackenzie, 2009). Seen thus, things \nare inherently unstable, materially as well as in their meanings \u2013 hence the importance of \nrepair and maintenance activities (Graham and Thrift, 2007; Gregson et al, 2009). But repair \nand maintenance are unable to keep holding things together. The Al Nabila IV with which \n 21 \n \nwe began this paper makes precisely that point. Objects, even objects as durable as this 30 \nyear old ship, eventually start to come apart, economically and physically, symbolically and \nsocially. As such, the object is but a temporary moment in an endless process of assembling \nmaterials, a partial stabilisation and a fragile accomplishment that is always inexorably \nbecoming something else, somewhere else.  \nThe instability in things points finally to the importance of the arts of transience. To work \nwith the future potentialities in things, with what things might become, is not an art \npossessed equally by all places. Animating materials anew, rekindling them is curtailed not \njust by limits of the imagination, by knowledge or indeed by ways of seeing, it is framed too \nby the categories and classifications that surround stuff in particular parts of the world \u2013 \nparticularly discarded objects declared to be \u2018end-of-life\u2019 \u2013 and by the markets that are \navailable to goods fabricated from secondary materials. Correspondingly, the places in the \nworld where the arts of transience are most vividly articulated are precisely those places \nwhere materials and \u2018wastes\u2019 are lightly regulated or unregulated and those where end-of-\nlife goods inexorably find their way to as a result. Bhatiary \u2013 and Bangladesh more generally \n\u2013 is one such place, and that Bhatiary emerged in conjunction with a spatially proximate ship \nbreaking business is indicative of the affinities between the activities of object destruction \nand revaluation. Bhatiary\u2019s arts of transience exemplify a flat ontological politics of materials \nbeing disassembled, reassembled and enrolled in new configurations \u2013 and reveal the \ndangers as well as productivities of such flattened ontologies. There  a bitter twist to the \ncelebrated virtue of recycling 99% of the ship materials returns to haunt the discussion. \nWith no distinction between materials, the furniture businesses of Bhatiary and their agents \nstrip out and rework their furniture from a range of boards -- some benign, some of toxic \nasbestos. The latter boards are also sold extensively within the construction industry and \ntherefore have been distributed widely across Bangladesh, notably in new build flats and \napartments. Correspondingly, we end the paper by sounding a note of caution regarding the \narts of transience. Whilst all materials have the potential to keep being assembled, there are \nsome materials which would surely be better off stabilised as wastes \u2013 even if thus \nsequestering them requires much by way of maintenance work. Asbestos is one such \nmaterial. The challenge for an ontological politics of vital materialisms is not just to \n 22 \n \nrecognise the distinctions in materials but to devise appropriate interventions that remain \nalive to the potential in the arts of transience whilst recognising their dangers.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper stems from research conducted under The Waste of the World programme, \nfunded by the Economic and Social Research Council (RES000232007).
