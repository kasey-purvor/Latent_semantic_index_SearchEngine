DH1 3LE \nEngland \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nLike a lot of my work, this article was stimulated by events around me in the \nnorth east of England. Specifically, the trigger was the proposal and \nsubsequent campaign for an elected Regional Assembly as part of an \nemerging devolved system of government in the English Regions and its \ndecisive rejection by a substantial majority of those who voted in a \nreferendum in November 2004. During the 1980s voices began to be raised in \nthe north east for a degree of constitutional reform and regional devolution as \na more effective way of tackling the region\u2019s continuing poor economic \nperformance (for example, see Byrne, 1990). In part, this reflected the failures \nof central government regional policies for the region to bring about an up-turn \nin the region\u2019s economic fortunes \u2013 indeed, these regional policies were \nswamped in their effects by waves of deindustrialisation as nationalisation \nbecame a mechanism for a profound regional deindustrialisation (Hudson, \n1989). These tendencies were reinforced sharply as the Thatcherite \nGovernment sought actively to cut the scope of state involvement in economy \nand society \u2013 with heavy impacts on regions such as the north east (for \nexample, see Beynon et al, 1991; 1994). From 1997 Blair\u2019s \u2018New Labour\u2019 \ngovernment embraced much of the Thatcherite neo-liberal economic agenda, \nand at the same time added a new strand in terms of seeking further to \ndevolve political power from central government to English regions and the \nCeltic nations (for discussion of these developments, see Morgan, 200i; \nTomaney, 2000).  \n \nWhile the devolution movements in Scotland and Wales were informed by \ncomplex mixtures of cultural, economic and political motives, much of the \nimpetus for this increased emphasis on devolution in England was more \nstraightforwardly economistic: that is, a belief that this would help reduce \ndifferences in regional economic performance and productivity and provide an \nalternative to the failures of past central government regional policies for \nperipheral regions. Consequently, especially among policymakers, the debate \nhas focused in particular on how the powers and functions of elected regional \nassemblies could be used to promote regional economic development and \nreduce regional inequalities (Russell Barter, 2002). Nowhere was this more \napparent than in north east England (Humphrey and Shaw, 2004). The \nnegative effects of central government policies in and on north east England \ncreated space for those who - drawing on a history of cross-class regionalist \nsolutions that go back to the 1930s (Hudson, 2005a) - wished to argue for a \n 1\ngreater degree of devolution of political power to the region.  More specifically, \nthey asserted that devolving the power of decision and commensurate \nresources to the region would create conditions for \u2013 if not quite guarantee - \nregional economic revival. In seeking to understand events unfolding around \nme in north east England - the reasons why this campaign gathered pace and \nwhy the offer of an elected Regional Assembly was rejected \u2013 I began to \nreflect upon the more general tendency to devolved government over much of \nthe capitalist world and to draw upon several developments in human \ngeography and related social sciences in the 1980s and 1990s that were both \nstimulated by and also encouraged this tendency.  \n \n \nChanges in the character of contemporary capitalism: the rise of neo-\nliberal globalisation, claims about the limits to national state activity and \nthe need for new governmentalities \n \nBy the latter half of the 1970s, the limits to Keynesian welfare statism had \nbecome evident, with fears of fiscal crisis (O\u2019Connor, 1973) leading to sharp \ncut-backs in the scope of state expenditure leading to widening intra-national \nregional inequalities over much of the capitalist world (for example, see \nDunford, 1994). The boundaries of state involvement in economy and society, \nit was claimed, had to be drawn more narrowly to allow greater scope for \nmarket forces as resource allocating mechanisms as the only route to restore \neconomic growth and prosperity. There were claims that previously powerful \nnational states were being disabled as a result of resurgent processes of \nglobalisation, a force beyond the control of national governments. The view \nthat national government policies can only adapt to globalisation trends and \nseek to ride with the tide and reap such benefits as is possible from so doing \ngained widespread acceptance in dominant policy circles. This reflected an \nemergent new dominant \u2013 if not quite hegemonic - governmentality (on the \nFoucauldian concept of governmentality, see Dean, 1999) that re-imagined \nrelations between economy, state and civil society and the re-scaling of \npolitical power within and beyond the state as the only possible response to \nautonomous processes of globalisation that somehow had a life of their own, \nbeyond the reach of political and social intervention. As such, all that could be \ndone was to adapt to them \u2013 there was, so the new consensus had it, no \npossibility of challenging them. Now this is clearly a one-sided and partial view \nof neo-liberal globalisation. Not least it conveniently ignored the extent to \nwhich neo-liberal globalisation was authored and scripted by some powerful \nnational states \u2013 notably the USA and UK -, and associated international \norganisations such as the IMF and World Bank, buttressed by supportive \nacademic commentators and apologists. Nonetheless it was a very influential \none.  \n \nThis emergent neo-liberal governmentality also re-imagined relations between \nthe national state and sub-national political entities. Political power was - \nallegedly \u2013 to be devolved to regions to enable them actively to compete for \ncapital investment as the route to economic prosperity. As all regions could \nsuccessfully compete, all could be \u201cwinners\u201d, and as a result regional \neconomic inequalities could be evened out.  For peripheral and  \n 2\ndeindustrialised regions such as north east England the reality was rather \ndifferent, not least because of the effects of previous phases of uneven \ndevelopment so that the inter-regional competitive playing field was far from \nlevel.  As a result, the outcome was participation in a race to the bottom \nbased on seeking to undercut competitor regions on cost as concerns with \nregional plans were replaced with regional strategies, premised on the \nassumption that there was no choice but to adapt to the external forces of \nglobalisation processes. \n \nRe-thinking the region: regions as subjects of policy \n \nThe growing emphasis within this emergent neo-liberal governmentality upon \nthe region as a pro-active subject rather than passive object in receipt  of \ncentral government financial aid, a political actor as well as a site of political \nactivity, chimed nicely with the growing emphasis on re-thinking the concept \nof the region that was increasingly in evidence from the later part of the \n1980s. The key in this process of re-thinking was what we might term the \nrelational turn (see Allen et al 1998; Amin, 2004). Regions are seen as \nconstituted from spatialized social relations, stretched out over space and \nmaterialised in various form, and representational narratives about them. \nRegions can be seen as products of complex condensations of social \nrelationships, of varying density and variety, which combine contingently in \nspecific time\/space couplings to produce what are, in the last analysis, unique \nregions.  \n \nThis relational approach provides a way of thinking that discloses a region \nwhich is by no means necessarily a whole, with the characteristics of \ncoherence which that term implies; nor is it necessarily a bounded and closed \nentity.  However, it is also the case that there is a wealth of evidence of \npeople seeking to construct regions as if they were closed, bounded and \ncoherent, with shared and unified regional interests. A relational approach \nemphasises that regions are defined for specific purposes, socially \nconstructed, both discursively and materially, in relation to specific criteria \n(Hudson, 2001, 255-85). This raises the critical questions of who acquires the \npower to represent a region in this way and speak on its behalf as it performs \nas a political subject in policy debates (Hudson, 2005b).   \n \n \nRe-organising the state \n \nIn recent years, the expansion of regional governance and government and \ngrowing devolution to regions has been reflected in and, to a degree, \nencouraged by a burgeoning academic literature (for example, Agnew, 2000; \nKeating, 1998). One of the more influential interpretations of this \ndevolutionary tendency is that of Jessop (for example, 1997; 2003; see also \nBrenner et al, 2003), which sees regional devolution as part of the new multi-\nscalar architecture of governance. This involves internationalisation of policy \nregimes, the de-nationalisation (\u2018hollowing out\u2019) of the political system with \ndevolution of power within the state to cities and regions and a selective shift \nof power and influence out of the state and into organisations in civil society \n 3\nvia a process of de-statisation. These shifts are linked to the emergence of \nnew network concepts and networked forms of regional governance, policy \nformation and delivery (for example, Benz A and F\u00fcrst D, 2002; Sternberg et \nal, 2000), crossing the state\/civil society boundary. These new forms of \ngoverning are typically referred to as partnerships, with temporary Task \nForces as an important innovation in this mode of policy delivery (Pike, 2002). \nOften, however, such networked approaches to regional policy and \ndevelopments ignore that point that such networks are constructed within the \ncontext of existing networks of social relations characterised by sharp power \nasymmetries (Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2003). Furthermore, the growing \nemphasis on governance is recognition of the increasing importance - or \nperhaps more accurately is increasing recognition of the importance - of the \ninstitutions of civil society as well as those of the state in securing the conditions \nunder which the economy is possible.  \n \nIn one respect, however, devolution to regions (and indeed other sub-national \nspatial scales) is well-established, as the central state has shifted the \nadministration of its policies to sub-national scales for reasons of both \nadministrative efficiency and legitimacy in many countries. What is claimed to \nbe new and qualitatively different about more recent regional devolution is that \nit encompasses the power to decide, plus resources to implement decisions, \nat regional level.  Others, however, dispute this, and argue that what has been \ndevolved to the regional level is responsibility without authority, power and \nresources. In effect, the national state shifts responsibility to the regional level \n\u2013 and if economic revival does not follow, it can lay the blame at the door of \nregional actors and organisations. Clearly which interpretation is correct is of \nsome significance, theoretically and practically, not least in terms of the \ncapacity to transform regional economies and radically alter regional \neconomic development trajectories.  \n \n \nRegional success stories: myths, illusions and raised expectations \n \nThere are certainly frequent claims in the literature over the last decade or so \nthat many of the regions that have experienced strong economic growth, \neconomic resurgence and transformation in a globalising world are those \nendowed with well-developed networks of regional institutions (for example, \nHarding et al, 1999; Storper, 1995; 1997). Proponents of devolved regional \ngovernment draw attention to a number of by now well-known, and rather \nstylised, \u201cregional economic success stories\u201d \u2013 such as the Third Italy, Silicon \nValley, or Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg \u2013 claiming that these are successful regional \neconomies because they have devolved forms of regional governance and \nappropriate \u201cinstitutional thickness\u201d (Amin and Thrift, 1994). Such regions are \nregularly cited as examples that demonstrate the close link between devolved \ngovernment, regional institutions and regional economic success. In so far as \nthis reflected a re-recognition of the social basis of the economy, it was to be \nwelcomed. In so far as it suggested that this re-socialisation could and should \ntake place at the regional scale, it was more problematic, not least because of \nthe legacy of the map of uneven development as a result of previous phases \nof capitalist development. By suggesting that the experiences of the \u201csuccess \n 4\nstories\u201d were generalisable and transferable, so that all regions could be \n\u201cwinners\u201d and the map of development thereby could be made more even and \nequitable. This led to raised expectations in other parts of the world - for \nexample, in post-Franco Spain, \u2018La Espa\u00f1a de las Autonom\u013aas\u2019 (Fern\u00e1ndez \nRodr\u013aguez, 1985), the United Kingdom and more generally the European \nUnion, with the emergence of \u201cThe Europe of the Regions\u201d - that regional \ndevolution would lead to more even economic development.  \n \nSuch claims, however, rest on a \u201csurprising\u201d paucity of supportive empirical \nevidence as to the links between devolution, regional economic success and \nregional inequality (Rodr\u013aguez\u2013Pose and Gill, 2004, 2117). Typically such \nevidence as there is of the link between devolved regional government and \nregional economic success is evidence of association rather than causation \n(cf. Boyer, 2005; Coriat and Dosi, 1998).  More generally, as Pike and \nTomaney (2004, 2093) put it, the precise nature of the linkages between \nregional governance and social development \u2013 and even more so, the \ncharacter and direction of any causal links between them \u2013 \u201cremains subject \nto conjecture\u201d. For Giordano and Roller (2004, 2165), reflecting on the \nevidence from a range of studies, the \u201ccommon assumption \u2026 that greater \nregional autonomy has led to positive impacts upon economic well-being\u201d is a \n\u201csomewhat bold claim\u201d. Not least, this is because of the persistence of \nregional inequalities and uneven development despite regional devolution. As \nthey go on to point out (ibid, 2179, emphasis added) in relation to Spain, \n\u201ccreating regional government has done very little to narrow deeply \nentrenched and long-standing disparities between the relatively wealthier and \npoorer Spanish regions. Although it is fair to say that greater autonomy has \nhelped to improve the economic fortunes of some of the poorer regions, at the \nsame time it is the wealthier regions that have benefited relatively more from \nhaving greater autonomy\u201d. In short, while some poorer regions have improved \ntheir economic fortunes, the major beneficiaries have been the already more \nprosperous regions \u2013 so that the map of inequalities has both widened and \nbecome more complicated.  \n \nMore generally, having reviewed the available evidence regarding the \nrelations between regional disparities and political decentralisation processes \nin Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Spain and the USA, Rodr\u013aguez\u2013Pose and Gill \n(2004, 2115) conclude that \u201cclaims of a supposed economic dividend in terms \nof territorial equity should be greeted with caution, if not with outright \nsketpicism\u201d.  Indeed they go further and in a similar  manner to Giordano and \nRoller in the specific case of Spain suggest that the persistence of regional \ninequalities is because of \u2013 rather than despite \u2013 such devolution. \nRecognising that \u201cthe causal direction of [the] relationship remains \nunconfirmed\u201d (an important caveat), \u201c in each of the countries examined the \nexplanation of rising inequality across regions could be logically traced to the \npolitical and policy-making events that have surrounded evolving centre-state \nrelations since 1980.   But in every case \u2013 with the possible exception of \nBrazil - there is sufficient evidence to suspect a relationship between \ndevolutionary initiatives and rising inequalities\u201d. While not the only cause, \ninstitutional decentralisation has a \u201clarge bearing\u201d on the persistence of \nregional inequality (Rodr\u013aguez\u2013Pose and Gill, 2004, 2100). At best, then \u2013 as \n 5\nthe ambiguity over the Brazilian case and the small number of Spanish \nregions that have benefited economically from devolution, as alluded to by \nGiordano and Roller suggests - if political devolution is to have positive effects \non regional economic performance and the map of regional inequality, then \nthese effects are contingent and understanding these contingencies takes on \npressing theoretical and practical importance.   \n \nMoreover, regional growth models in the iconic and exemplary successful \nregions are not only claimed to be grounded in regionally-specific institutions \nand devolved forms of governance but also to be socially inclusive and \negalitarian developmental models. However, the available evidence as to the \nsocial relations of the economy in these regions often sits uneasily with such \nclaims. In so far as there is evidence of regional economic success, it is often \nseemingly based upon exploitative and regressive social relations within the \nworkplace in terms of low wages and poor working conditions (for example, \nsee Hadjimichalis, 2005; Ferus-Comelo, 2005). This is in strong contrast to \nthe stylised accounts that represent these as examples of socially inclusive \nand progressive growth models. Thus, more generally this reinforces the \nsalience of the conclusion that \u201cwhat devolved governance is for and in whose \ninterest remain fundamental questions\u201d (Pike and Tomaney, 2004, 2091). \n \nIn summary, there may well be circumstances in which devolved regional \ngovernment may (but does not automatically) bring a range of benefits other \nthan regional economic revival \u2013 such as greater political accountability and \ntransparency in decision making and political processes (for example, as in \npost-Franco Spain: see Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u013aguez, 1985). These are to be \nwelcomed. Critically, however, the frequently asserted link between political \ndevolution and economic success, which came to form the main plank of the \nargument for an elected Regional Assembly in north east England, is often \njust that: asserted, without a firm evidential basis that convincingly \ndemonstrates that the relationship is causal and that the direction of causation \nis from political devolution to economic success rather than vice versa. Now of \ncourse it could be argued that causation in social life is always more \ncomplicated, involving multi-variate relations and recursive feedback loops, \ncomplex processes and emergent effects and properties \u2013 but that is a \ndifferent issue \u2026 \n \n \nConclusions \n \nThe main conclusions relating to putative links between devolved regional \ngovernment and\/or governance and regional economic success can be \nsummarised as follows.  First, there are many good reasons to support \nregional devolution, such as increased accountability and transparency in \npolitical decision-making. Even so, the extent to which this would involve \ndevolving power to the region and, if power was devolved, what this would \ntranslate to in terms of progressive developmental policies and transparent \nand accountable decision making, remains unclear. The proliferation of \nappointed and unelected organisations such as QUANGOS and Task Forces \nemphasises that there is no necessary connection between devolution and \n 6\nenhanced accountability and transparency (Pike, 2004). Secondly, and \ncritically, regional devolution is unlikely to lead to regional economic success \nin the north east of England \u2013 and indeed in other peripheralised regions, \nespecially if economic success continues to be defined via the parameters of \nthe formal mainstream capitalist economy (such as profitability and share-\nholder value). The law of value and processes of combined and uneven \ndevelopment are integral to the expansion of capital (for example, see \nHarvey, 1982) and as such cannot simply to abolished by regional devolution. \nAt best political devolution may be a necessary condition for regional \neconomic revival in some peripheralised regions but it is certainly not a \nsufficient one \u2013 and it cannot be the basis of a \u201cwin win\u201d scenario in which all \nregions become economically successful and equally prosperous. \nFurthermore, there are numerous examples of regional economic growth in \nthe absence of political devolution to the region. However, regional economic \nsuccess does not necessarily equate with socially inclusive and equitable \ndevelopment within a region. Moreover, it may well be that regional devolution \nmay exacerbate the problems of weak and peripheralised  regions precisely \nbecause it further reinforces the advantages of those core regions that are \nalready economically more successful. The success of some regions in \n\u201cwinning\u201d may be directly related to the failure of others in \u201closing\u201d. As concern \nfor inter-regional equality is (albeit only implicitly) compromised by policies \nthat emphasise regional autonomy, and the role of government in promoting \ninter-regional equity gives way to an emphasis upon securing conditions to \nallow regions to compete in place-markets, devolution to regions \u201chas \nunleashed forces that seem to be contributing to perpetuate and, in some \ncases, aggravate existing disparities\u201d (Rodr\u013aguez\u2013Pose and Gill, 2004, 2115).  \nThe clear implication is that if such peripheralised and marginalised regional \neconomies are to be revived and regenerated, this will require a lot more than \nsimply some limited devolution of political power within the structures of the \nstate and systems of multi-level and multi-scalar governing. It remains an \nopen question as to the extent to which this would be possible, precisely \nbecause they have been peripheralised as a consequence of the inner \ndynamic of capital accumulation and the combined and uneven character that \nthe capitalist form of economic development necessarily and unavoidably \nassumes.  \n \nThirdly, on the other hand, a failure to appreciate that there is no necessary \ncausal relationship between regional devolution and regional economic \nsuccess may well seriously weaken the case for regional devolution, which on \nother grounds may be something to welcome. Therefore there are manifest \npolitical dangers in pinning the argument for regional devolution to the mast of \n\u2018regional economic success\u2019. This is only likely to lead \u2013 once again - to \nunrealised expectations and disappointment, discrediting the concept of \ndevolution per se and cutting the ground from beneath the other to be \nwelcomed ways in which the concept of greater political devolution and \nregional accountability could enhance life in peripheral regions. Fourthly, there \nis a need for eternal vigilance to guard against the danger of allowing the \npursuit of the Holy Grail of regional economic renewal and revival via regional \ndevolution to become the \u2018enabling myth\u2019 (Dugger, 2000) through which the \ncentral state shifts the blame onto the victim for the continuing economic \n 7\nproblems of regions such as north east England. Finally, there is a need to \nrecognise the limits to devolution of power within the formal political system in \norder to open up space in which to explore more radical alternatives.  \n \nThis re-thinking would need to encompass at least five dimensions. First, re-\nthinking the economy, and recognising that this embraces much more than \nthe formal mainstream market economy. Secondly, re-thinking development \nso as, for example, to give much more weight to questions of distribution and \nissues such as health and well-being. Thirdly, re-thinking appropriate forms of \npolitics, to explore more participatory forms of democratic practice, more open \nand transparent fora for political decision making beyond as well as within the \nformal structures of party politics. Fourthly, recognising the limits to the \nregional, and insisting that the national state continues to acknowledge its \nresponsibilities for the social and economic well-being of its citizens, wherever \nthey live. For example, as Rodr\u013aguez\u2013Pose and Gill (2004, 2115) conclude, \n\u201c(regional) devolution per se will \u2026not deliver greater territorial equity. This \nobjective would require the establishment of substantial interterritorial fiscal \nequalisation systems at the national or supranational level if the persistence \nand permanence of economic disparities are not to become one of the \nhallmarks of future geographies\u201d. More generally, \u201cthe national state remains \npivotal and often decisive in shaping the character and extent of subnational \ngovernance and economic and social development (Pike and Tomaney, 2004, \n2093). Acknowledging the force of this point, however, it is equally important \nto stress that the state apparatus cannot be simply and non-problematically \n\u2018captured\u2019 to address the needs of the mass of the population of north east \nEngland or any other peripheralised region. The key issue then becomes the \narchitecture of the system of governing and the power relations between the \nregional and national within, but also beyond, the structures of the state. \nFinally, and perhaps most importantly of all, re-thinking the region to escape \nthe limitations of the myth of a unified (and unifying) regional interest and \nexplicitly acknowledge the existence of different \u2013 and at times openly \ncompetitive, grounded in different class structural positions and other sources \nof social power \u2013 interests held by individuals and social groups living in the \nsame space. Within such an agonistic politics, which interests prevailed and \nwhich were prioritised in state policy agendas would be seen as the outcome \nof overtly political struggle based on a recognition of legitimate (or at least \nlegally sanctioned) difference \u2013 often grounded in structurally asymmetrical \npower relations - rather than a presumption of homogeneity of interest on the \nbasis of a shared regional identity. Recognition of this emphasises that \nprogress towards new moral geographies would need to grapple with more \ncomplex spatialities than simply those of inter-regional relations. \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nA number of people very kindly contributed to the preparation of this progress \nreport by supplying material that I have drawn on in writing it: Simon \nBatterbury; Sara Fuller; Sara Gonsalez; Neill Marshall; Damian Maye; Andy \nPike; and Andr\u00e9 Rodriguez-Pose.  \n \n 8\n \nReferences \n \nAgnew J, 2000, \u201cFrom the political economy of regions to regional political \neconomy\u201d, Progress in Human Geography, 24, 101-110. \n \nAllen J, Massey D and Cochrane A, 1998, Re-thinking the Region, Routledge, \nLondon. \n \nAmin A, 2004, \u201cRegions abound: towards a new politics of place\u201d, \nGeogfrafiska Annaler B, 86, 33-44. \n \nAmin A and Thrift N, 1994, \u201cLiving in the global\u201d, in Amin A and Thrift N (Eds.), \nGlobalization, Institutions and Regional Development in Europe, Oxford \nUniversity Press, Oxford, 1-22. \nBenz A and F\u00fcrst D, 2002,\u201dPolicy learning in regional networks\u201d, \nEuropean Urban and Regional Studies, 9, 212-35. \n \nBeynon H, Hudson R and Sadler D, 1991, A Tale of Two Industries: The \nContraction of Coal and Steel in North East England, Open University Press, \nMilton Keynes. \n \nBeynon H, Hudson R and Sadler D, 1994, A Place Called Teesside: A Locility \nin a Global Economy, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh. \n \nBoyer R, 2005, \u201cInstitutional Complementarity: Related concepts, origins, \nmethods and research agenda\u201d, in Wood G (Ed.)
