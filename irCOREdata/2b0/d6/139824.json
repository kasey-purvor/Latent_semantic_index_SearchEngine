From unmanned ground and air vehicles to hand held cellular phones, the emphasis is on \nsize reduction and increased operating envelope1,2,3. The term micro aerial vehicle (MAV) refers to a \nsmaller-size of remotely controlled aircraft (UAV). The target dimension for MAVs today is \napproximately 10-15cm, while development of insect-size aircrafts, though a highly-motivated challenge, \nis not expected in the near future. Potential military, scientific, police and mapping are the more important \napplications that motivate the target. Another promising area is remote observation of hazardous \nenvironments which are hard or in-accessible to ground vehicles. MEMS technology has brought major \nimprovement in all aspects except one; power sources2,3. In order to comply with miniaturization, the need \nfor high energy-density power units is becoming more and more apparent. Large scale high energy-density \nsources, such as jet engines and turbines are commonplace, yet no sources that suit the micro scale devices \ncurrently exist. Over the last two decades the energy density of chemical storage cells (batteries) has only \nincreased by a factor of two (on average 600kJ\/kg alkaline and 1,200kJ\/kg lithium), far less than the \nincreasing demand5,6,7. The growing gap between demand and supply has led intense search elsewhere. In \nthese efforts, owing to the superior energy densities of hydrocarbon fuels (on average 30,000-\n40,000kJ\/kg), it is immediately evident that herein lies a possible solution. Even with thermal efficiencies \nas low as 5%, ICE converted hydrocarbon fuels are still superior to battery-motor electrical systems8.  \nMicro-Engines are not simply smaller versions of their macro-scale counterparts. Many of the major \ncomponents cannot be easily reduced in order to achieve proper functioning and it is clear that the micro \nscale engine is to be very different from the macro scale known to us6. Physical processes such as \ncombustion, heat transfer and gas exchange are to be re-evaluated at a fundamental level before they may \nbe applied to micro-engines. Research has shown that a power law was found that relates engine power to \nengine mass8. Additional concerns are friction, sealing and fabrication limitations6.  \nLee and Kwon4 suggested that lower limit of the combustor size and the combustion efficiency in small-\nscale combustors are two of the most prominent questions. A major problem in the development of a \nmicro-engine is the combustion in a very limited volume. Existing understanding of combustion in a \nvolume that is comparable to the laminar flame thickness is limited9. One of the impeding factors is the \nquenching distance. Quenching phenomena in micro scale combustion may be due to two primary \nmechanisms, thermal and radical quenching. Thermal quenching occurs when the heat loss through the \nchamber wall is too high for the combustion process to be self-sustained. Radical quenching occurs due to \nadsorption of radicals on the combustion chamber walls that results in lack of homogeneous combustion2. \nBoth mechanisms become more significant in the micro-scale, the former being of more concern than the \nlater. Common values of boundary flame quenching of hydrocarbon fuels are 1mm. Considering a \ncombustion chamber that is as small as 4mm in diameter conveys the problem. How to prevent thermal \nquenching and achieve stable combustion is one of the most challenging issues in micro-combustion10.  \n 4\nAnother concern is residence time. In order to achieve stable combustion, reactant residence time must be \nlonger than the chemical reaction time. On the macro-scale, residence time is always long enough and is \nnever a limiting factor. Decreasing the combustion chamber\u2019s dimensions leads to significant reduction of \nresidence time since the flow speed cannot be reduced accordingly11. In order to maintain a working cycle \nand sufficient power output, higher engine velocities must be maintained. This leads to shorter residence \ntime while chemical reaction time stays the same. This phenomenon has subsequent consequences since \ninsufficient residence time leads to incomplete or partial combustion, in turn leading to insufficient heat \ngeneration and further quenching12.  \nSubstantial heat transfer to the boundaries could influence micro-combustion. Heat generation is \nproportional to the combustor volume while heat loss is proportional to the surface area. This ratio is \ninversely proportional to the characteristic dimension of the combustion chamber. Thus, the heat transfer \nrate increases as the chamber dimension decreases. This is advantageous in micro-chemical systems \nbecause highly exothermic processes such as catalytic partial-oxidation reactions and the catalytic \noxidation can be controlled5. In our case, however, this phenomenon is counter-productive since excessive \nheat loss will in turn lead to increased quenching and eventually to output losses. Reduced scale also \nincreases the temperature gradient at the jacket and further increases the conduction heat loss. \nThe characteristic length of the combustion chamber and the reacting gas flow path in micro-combustors is \nstill sufficiently larger than the molecular mean-free path of the air and other gasses flowing through the \nsystem. Hence, the fluid media can be reasonably considered as continuous2. Since all the characteristic \ndimensions in micro-combustion are small and Reynolds numbers are well under turbulent values, a \nlaminar viscous flow may be considered. Sher and Levinzon13 showed that even if perfect mixing, and \ninfinite flame speed are considered for a spark-ignition engine, the energy released by the fuel strongly \ndepend on the effective volume of the burning volume. This in turn, determines the maximum cycle \ntemperature, and thus its efficiency and specific power. \nHomogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), was first identified and studied by Onishi14. It \ninvolves compressing a homogenous fuel-air mixture until it self-combusts. It differs from Diesel \ncombustion because the charge is premixed and only then compressed and it differs from SI combustion \nbecause the ignition is spontaneous and not spark-induced. The combustion occurrence depends on \nchemical kinetics and the compression process15. Verified characteristics of HCCI include: 1. Ignition \noccurs simultaneously at numerous locations within the combustion chamber, 2. Traditional flame \npropagation advance is absent, 3. There is no need of an external event to initiate ignition, 4. Both rich and \nextremely lean fuel mixtures may be used, 5. Charge is consumed rapidly, 6. A wide variety of fuels may \nbe used, 7. Essentially, no compression ratio limitations5,6,16. When considering micro-scale applications, \nHCCI advantages are an apparent answer to most of the impeding concerns. Combustion rates limited by \nkinetics rather than transport and essentially no flame propagation lead to shorter charge consumption time \nand in turn higher operational engine speeds are allowed. Auto ignition implies that the charge is \nconsumed uniformly, consequently minimizing quenching effects. Both these traits essentially bring \ncombustion closer to a constant volume procedure pushing the thermodynamic process closer to an ideal \n 5\nOtto cycle. No external ignition system is required absolving both the timing issues at the high speeds and \nthe need for micro-scale spark inducers that fit the mechanism. The ability to sustain combustion with very \nlean mixtures reduces fuel mass losses via leakage between the piston and cylinder, adversely enhancing \nfuel consumption efficiency6,13. \nBecause of the high surface to volume ratio of miniature IC engine, the friction between the sealing rings \nand the cylinder walls become a major factor, and in some cases are in the order of the engine power. For \nthis reason, no rings are practically installed in these engines. Consequently, high precision manufacturing \nis needed in order to minimize the piston-cylinder walls gap. Practically m\u03bc2010 \u2212 is feasible. In these \nengines charge leakage is therefore unavoidable, and thus high engine speed is needed to lessen the losses \nincurred. However, when the piston velocity is faster, hydrodynamic friction losses between the piston and \nthe cylinder-walls become more and more important. Sher et al.17 proposed that the lower possible \nminiaturization limit of the HCCI engines is predominantly determined by the charge leakage through the \ncylinder-piston gap. A comprehensive mathematical model has been developed to characterize the relevant \nprocesses inside the cylinder (including the cylinder-piston gap) and then solve numerically to yield the \ninter-relationships between the charge leakage through the cylinder-piston gap, the engine geometrical \ndimensions and the engine speed. They found that the minimal practically possible size of a miniature \nHCCI engine depends on two major parameters; the engine speed and the gap width between the piston \nand the cylinder walls. It was postulated that since no rings are involved in miniature engines, the higher \nthe engine speed and the smaller the cylinder -piston gap width are, the higher the engine efficiency is.  \nHowever, in practical terms, the engine speed is limited by the strength of material from which the \nmechanical mechanism is made of (connecting rod, bearings, piston pin and crank). The gap width is \npractically limited by the fabrication method, thermal expansion coefficient and mechanical unsymmetrical \nstresses.  \nIn the present work we propose an approximate analytical solution to this problem. An approximated \nanalytical solution is proposed to yield the lower possible limits of scaling-down HCCI cycle engines. The \npresent work presents a simple algebraic equation that shows these inter-relationships, thus constituting \nanalytical expressions to postulate the lower possible miniaturization limits of IC engines. \nTheoretical Consideration \nIn this section a phenomenological approximate model is developed to consider the relevant processes \ninside the cylinder of a Homogeneous-Charge Compression-Ignition (HCCI) engine. Figure 1 shows a \nschematic sketch of a simple SI crankcase-scavenged two-stroke engine18. Special attention is drawn to the \ninter-relationships between the charge leakage through the cylinder-piston gap, the engine geometrical \ndimensions and the engine speed. The cycle has been simplified and idealized in order to constitute the \nlowest possible scaling-down limit of an HCCI engine. \nBasic assumptions \n1. HCCI two-stroke engine with no piston rings. \n 6\n2. In order to find the lowest scaling down law, except for the gas exchange process and possible \ncharge leakage, an ideal Otto cycle is considered: combustion occurs in a constant volume \nprocess, and compression and expansions strokes are adiabatic. \n3. The fresh charge and the burnt gas, each, behaves as an ideal gas with cp=const. \n4. The scavenging is a perfect mixing process. \n5. The flow through the gap is isothermal, compressible, one-dimensional, and quasi-static. \n6. The leakage reduces the effective compression process. The minimum effective compression \nprocess is determined by the lowest allowed compression temperature which must be higher \nthan the fuel ignition temperature, thus, igncompressio TT > . \nBased on a previous study13, it is postulated that the engine scaling-down limit is determined \npredominantly by the amount of charge induced and the amount of leakage through the gap between the \npiston and the cylinder. It is thus expected that at low engine speeds the amount of charge leakage has an \nimportant effect on the engine power, while at higher engine speeds  the amount of leakage per cycle \nreduces, and the cylinder charging efficiency and engine friction losses dominate the engine performance. \nEstimation of the cylinder charging efficiency and engine power \nThe scavenging process is assumed to be a perfect mixing process18, and thus the charging efficiency of the \ncylinder is:  \n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u0394\u2212\u2212== \u03c4\u03b7\ningch\ncylinder\ncylinder\nch\nt\nm\nm arg\nmax_\nexp1  (1) \nWhere \u03c4 is the time period during which the scavenging ports open.

Following Heywood and Sher18, the \ntypical effective scavenging port area is half of the cylinder cross section area. A fair estimation of the \ncharacteristic time required to fill the cylinder may be obtained when the charging velocity is assumed to \nbe close to sonic. Thus, \n00\n21\na\nL\nAreaPortScavengingEffective\nvolumetrappedMaximun\na\n==\u03c4 , and eq.

The power losses due to the friction between the \ncylinder skirt, the rings and the cylinder wall are represented mainly by the 3rd term of eq. (6), and \ntherefore this parameter is to be calibrated to fit a no rings engine. The engine brake power, by definition, \nis the difference between ip (eq. 5) and fp (eq. 6) thus, fpipbp \u2212= . \n 8\nModel Calibration \nThe mathematical model has been calibrated to fit experimental results of two small bore engines. The first \nengine, TD .020, is one of the smallest 2-stroke engines ever produced (the only smaller one known to the \nauthors is the TD .010 produced in 1997. Its bore=0.602cm, stroke=0.574 and swept volume=0.1634cc. No \nformal data is available for this engine). The 2nd engine, TD 0.15 is another small bore engine for which \nrelevant data are available. The specifications of the two engines are tabulated in the following table: \nTable 1: Engine specifications \nEngine type COX 2-stroke COX 2-stroke \nEngine model TEE-DEE .02 TEE-DEE .15 \nScavenging system Schnurle Schnurle \nCharging Naturally aspirated Naturally aspirated \nBore [cm] 0.762 1.486 \nStroke [cm] 0.716 1.488 \nSwept volume [cc] 0.3266 2.45 \nPeak power output [W] 41.0 at 23,200rev\/min 260.0 at 17,000rev\/min \nFigure 2 shows how the 3rd term friction coefficient - c in eq. (6), affects the prediction of the specific \npower curve of these particular engines. Also shown are some available experimental results19. The effect \nof the charging deterioration is clearly seen for the case of a hypothetical engine without friction (c=0), \nwhere the specific power deviate from a linear dependence on the engine speed (in fact, the 1st and 2nd \nterms of eq. (6) are not zero, but the 1st is a constant and doesn't depend on the engine speed, while the 2nd \ncontributes a negative value to the friction losses). Beside of the breathing constrains, the friction losses \nplay a major role in shaping the performance curves of any engine, and it seems that c=2.2 fits best the \nexperimental results of the two COX engines. \nResults and Discussion \nIn order to achieve good scavenging in small two-stroke engines, the cylinder length to the cylinder bore \nratio should be around a unity18. In the following discussion (except for the two specific engines for which \nexact dimensions are provided) we assume L~D, and thus the engine characteristic dimension is the engine \nbore. In HCCI engines, ignition occurs when the temperature of the cylinder charge reaches the ignition \ntemperature. For an adiabatic cylinder, the in-cylinder temperature prior to ignition depends on the \ncompression ratio and the charge fraction loss due to leakage. The charge fraction loss due to leakage \ndepends on the engine dimensions (bore and ports heights), gap width and engine speed. It follows that for \na particular geometry, the engine speed must exceed a certain value such that the time allowed for leakage \nis short enough to obtain the required effective compression, as illustrated in Fig. 3a for a cylinder bore of \n3cm. As expected, a wider gap width results in a higher required compression ignition to ensue ignition at \na given engine speed. The required compression ratio increases at low engine speeds and approaches a \nconstant value at the higher engine speeds. For wider gaps the requirement becomes higher in particular at \n 9\nlow engine speeds. The corresponding specific power of the engine, i.e., power to volume ratio, increases \nas the gap width decreases (Fig. 3b). At low engine speeds, it increases nearly linearly with the engine \nspeed, while at higher engine speeds the specific power reaches a maximal value and then drops to zero. \nThe latter is attributed to the deterioration of the charging efficiency and the increasing friction power \nlosses as the engine speed increases. \nThe effect of the engine size on the required compression ratio and corresponding specific power for a gap \nwidth of 20\u03bcm, is shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, respectively. As compared to the larger engine with the same \ngap width, in the smaller engines the charge fraction loss is higher and the minimum required piston speed \nincreases. This may explain the experienced starting difficulties of small engines w\/o glow plugs, in which \nhigh speed starters are needed. Figure 4 also suggests that the engine speed at which the engine develops \nits maximum power depends on the engine bore. Closer examination revealed that it doesn't depend \nnoticeably on the gap size though its maximal power does significantly as shown soon after. Figure 5 \nshows the relationship between the speed at which the engine develops its maximum power and the engine \nbore for miniature engines. \nThe effects of the gap width between the piston and the cylinder wall on the minimum required \ncompression ratio and specific power is demonstrated in Figs. 6a and 6b for a miniature engine as \ndescribed in table 1. As compared to the hypothetical case for which no gap is involved, the maximum \nengine power drops dramatically from above 200W\/cc to below 50W\/cc when the gap increases to 20\u03bcm, \nwhich may explain the traditional low overall efficiencies of energy conversion (to distinguish from the \nthermal cycle efficiencies) of miniature engines. The required compression ratio for maximum power \nincreases from around 6 to 16, while the speed range of engine operation becomes noticeably narrower. \nFigure 3 shows how the specific power and maximum engine speed depend on the gap width for a cylinder \nbore of 3cm. It is noted that while the maximum engine speed is not realistic, the engine speed at which \nmaximum power is obtained is an important and practical parameter for such small size engines. Figure 3 \nalso suggests that the gap width is a crucial parameter in scaling down engines; a gap width above 20\u03bcm \ncasts a severe limitation for the engine size. It is anticipated that for such high engine speeds a high \nvolatile, low ignition temperature and low ignition delay fuels are essentially required. Figure 7 shows how \nthe ignition temperature of the fuel affects the required minimum compression ratio and minimum engine \nspeed, for a small bore engine of 0.762cm with a gap width of 10\u03bcm. The value of 0.762cm corresponds to \na 0.3266cc engine which represents one of the smallest available 2-stroke engines in the market. The \ntypical fuel for a miniature two-stroke engine is a 30% nitro-methane fuel with an ignition temperature of \naround 600K. The ignition temperature of the fuel is clearly an important issue for the engine designer. \nFigure 8 shows some  important results that can be drawn from the present study; it shows the maximum \nspecific power of a miniature engine vs. the gap width and its cylinder bore. The corresponding engine \nspeeds are shown in Fig. 5. The following conclusions may be postulated: 1) the engine power decreases as \nthe gap width increases. 2) As the engine size decreases the power output is less sensitive to the gap width. \n3) For a gap width of 10\u03bcm (which is typical to the present surface texture), the minimum possible engine \n 10\nsize is 0.4cm bore (corresponds to 0.05cc). 4) For a more realistic gap width of 20\u03bcm (which reflects \nthermal distortions in well-designed engines), the minimum possible engine size is 0.7cm bore \n(corresponds to 0.27cc). The COX TD .010 is the smallest engine ever produced commercially had a \nbore=0.602cm and a stroke=0.574 (corresponds to a swept volume=0.1634cc). Fig. 8 suggests a maximum \ngap width=16m\u03bc for this engine. 5) For smaller engines of 0.3 or 0.2cm bore, the engine should be \nmanufactured such that  the gap width at operation conditions must be as small as a few microns, while \nengines' speeds at maximum power are expected to be higher than 30,000rev\/min. Even though such a \nsmall gap can hardly be achieved today in practice without sealing rings, it is still a challenging and \ninteresting task for the future. \nThe lower possible limits of scaling-down HCCI cycle engines can be fairly estimated for high engine \nspeeds, which are typical for miniature engines with the following additional assumptions. For this purpose \nwe assume that the 3rd term of eq. (6), which represents the power losses due to the friction between the \ncylinder skirt, the rings and the cylinder wall, becomes dominant. Considering that\n604\n2 NLDtfmepfp \u03c0= , \nand \nL\nu\nN piston\n2\n60= , eq. (6) yields: \n3\n226\n32\n6010\npistonuL\nDcfp \u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b=\n\u2212\u03c0  (7) \nFurthermore, figs. 3 and 4 show that for the examined cases the maximum power of the engine is obtained \nat about half of its maximum possible speed. Therefore, the maximum engine speed, which is evidently \nachieved when fpip = , may be derived from the following equation:  \n( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) cpistoncpistonthpiston\npistoncChth\nh\nFA\nFA\nc\nL\nu\na\nDu\nau\nu\nL\nDcNh\nFA\nFALD\n+\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212\n\u23aa\u23ad\n\u23aa\u23ac\n\u23ab\n\u23aa\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\u2212\u2212=\n\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u22c5=+\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n11030\n41\n3\n1exp1\n:or\n84\n6010\n6014\n)1(\n62\n0\n2\nmax0max\n0\nmax\n2\nmax\n3\n226\n0\n2\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03b4\u03b7\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b7\u03b7\n (8) \nEquation (8) is an approximate implicit equation that relates the maximum possible engine speed to the \ncylinder dimensions and gap width. Equation (8) constitutes the lower possible miniaturization limits of IC \nengines. \nConclusions \nIn the present work a phenomenological model has been developed to consider the relevant processes \ninside the cylinder of a Homogeneous-Charge Compression-Ignition (HCCI) engine. The inter-\nrelationships between the pertinent parameters (the charge leakage through the cylinder-piston gap, the \nengine geometrical dimensions and the engine speed), has been established. An approximated analytical \n 11\nsolution is proposed to yield the lower possible limits of scaling-down HCCI cycle engines. The present \nwork presents simple algebraic equations that shows the inter-relationships between the pertinent \nparameters, and constitutes the lower possible miniaturization limits of IC engines. We show that the \nminimal practically possible size of a miniature HCCI engine  depends on two major parameters; the \nengine speed and the gap width between the piston and the cylinder walls; the higher the engine speed and \nthe smaller the cylinder piston gap width are, the higher the engine energy conversion efficiency is.  \nHowever, in practical terms, the engine speed is limited by the strength of material from which the \nmechanical mechanism is made of (connecting rod, bearings, piston pin and crank). The gap width is \npractically limited by the fabrication method, thermal expansion coefficient and mechanical asymmetrical \nstresses. Current technology allows an engine speed of up to around 40,000 to 60,000rev\/min, while a gap \nwidth of 6-8\u03bcm is hardly feasible. Under these conditions, we found that the minimum allowed engine size \nis between 0.3 and 0.4cc. \nReferences \n1 Cadou, C. and Menon, S., \u201cScaling of Losses in Small IC Aero Engines with Engine Size\u201d, 42nd \nAIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, Reno, AIAA-2004-0690, Reno NV, Jan, 2004. \n2 Hua, J., Wu, M. and Kumar, K., \u201cNumerical simulation of the combustion of hydrogen-air mixture \nin micro-scaled chambers.
