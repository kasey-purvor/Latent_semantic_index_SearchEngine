Introduction \n \nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP; Figure \n1) underwent the most dramatic warming of any region in the Southern Hemisphere (Vaughan et \nal., 2003). Mean annual air temperatures here increased by nearly 3\u00baC during this period, with the \nwarming concentrated predominantly in the austral fall and winter (King and Harangozo, 1998; \nTurner et al., 2005). Whilst some studies have linked a warming in this region to a change in the \nlarge-scale atmospheric circulation (in particular, a strengthening of the polar vortex, e.g. \nThompson and Solomon (2002), an explanation for the full magnitude and seasonality of the \nobserved warming remains elusive.  \n \nA paucity of reliable information on atmospheric circulation prior to the availability of satellite \ntemperature sounder data in the late 1970s has hampered studies seeking to elucidate the causes \nand nature of the WAP warming. However, recent data have shown a strong correlation between \natmospheric circulation in this region and WAP temperatures. Anomalously cyclonic conditions \nhave been observed to be associated with warmer WAP winters as a result of increased warm air \nadvection. Conversely, anomalously anticyclonic conditions have been observed to be associated \nwith colder WAP winters caused by a decrease in warm air advection (Turner et al., 1997). \nAccordingly, it seems likely that the trend toward higher WAP temperatures has been \naccompanied by a shift toward more cyclonic atmospheric circulation. The observed increase in \nprecipitation at WAP stations during the period 1956-1992 is consistent with such a shift (Turner \net al., 1997). \n \n 4\nThe warming over the Antarctic Peninsula has had a profound influence on the ice sheet. A recent \nstudy showed that the majority of glaciers retreated during the past 50 years, and that average \nretreat rates are accelerating (Cook et al., 2005). It has also been shown that the annual duration \nof melting conditions has increased markedly on the Antarctic Peninsula (Vaughan, 2006). \nWhilst the majority of the increased meltwater will be refrozen within the ice sheet, there are \nindications that the increased runoff will make a significant contribution to global sea level rise \n(Vaughan, 2006). \n \nSignificant changes have also been observed in sea ice adjacent to the WAP. A long-term \nreduction in sea ice extent in the Bellingshausen Sea has been inferred, based on comparisons of \nmodern data with earlier (sparse) data from ship observations during the middle of the twentieth \ncentury (King and Harangozo, 1998). The Bellingshausen Sea has also undergone a shortening of \nthe sea ice season during the satellite era (Jacobs and Comiso, 1993; Parkinson, 2002).  \n \nRelatively little is known concerning the role of the ocean in this WAP climate change. There are \nindications of a large-scale warming of the deep waters of the Southern Ocean (Gille, 2002), \nsome of which intrude onto the shelf in modified form, and studies have shown that melt rates of \nglaciers can depend strongly upon the temperature of marine waters impacting on them \n(Shepherd et al., 2004). However, the hypothesised link between changing ocean and glacial \nconditions is not yet proven. Observations of changing properties in the WAP and Bellingshausen \nSea regions during the second half of the twentieth century have shown a profound warming of \nthe summer ocean surface, of sufficient magnitude to have ecological consequences (Meredith \n 5\nand King, 2005). There has also been a marked salinification of the summer ocean surface, \ncaused by mixed layer processes driven by reduced sea ice formation (Meredith and King, 2005). \n \nIt is important to develop an understanding of the freshwater budget of the upper ocean adjacent \nto the WAP. At temperatures near the freezing point, seawater density depends almost entirely \nupon salinity. Accordingly, freshwater supplied to the ocean surface will act to strongly stabilise \nthe water column, whilst sea ice formation (extraction of freshwater from the ocean surface) will \ndestabilise the upper ocean and lead to deeper mixed layers (Meredith et al., 2004; Smith and \nKlinck, 2002). Research in the WAP region has shown that water column stability and a shallow \nmixed layer are essential to phytoplankton bloom development (Mitchell and Holm-Hansen, \n1991). Seasonal variability in the amount and spatial extent of glacial meltwater supplied to the \nocean plays a critical role in oceanic ecosystem processes, and particularly primary production \n(Dierssen et al., 2002). For example, adding a thin lens of freshwater to the ocean surface will \ngreatly increase its stability, hence enabling phytoplankton to remain within a favourable light \nenvironment by preventing mixing to depths where light is a limiting factor. It should also be \nnoted that glacial meltwater can be enriched in iron and other micronutrients, resulting from the \nglacial scouring of underlying rock surfaces and accumulation from atmospheric deposition \n(Dierssen et al., 2002). It has been argued that increased runoff from melting glaciers as the \nAntarctic Peninsula continues to warm could lead to an increase in biomass in coastal waters, and \na shift in phytoplankton assemblage composition (Dierssen et al., 2002). It is known that in the \nWAP region, lower salinities are associated with a transition from a diatom-dominated system to \none dominated by smaller cryptophytes, with potential consequences for the abundance of \nzooplankton populations (Moline et al., 2000).  \n 6\n As well as being sensitive to climate variability itself, changes in the region west of the WAP can \nalso drive variability in ocean properties at lower latitudes. Results from climate modelling \nstudies have shown that the Bellingshausen Sea area, when \u201chosed\u201d with additional freshwater \ninputs, can induce variability in ocean properties in the tropical Atlantic on decadal timescales, \nwith oceanic advection being a key process (Hickey and Weaver, 2004). \n \nGiven the importance of freshwater to both physical and ecological dynamics west of the WAP \nand beyond, it is clearly desirable to maintain systematic monitoring capable of distinguishing the \nchanging inputs to the ocean of freshwater from different sources, so that their effects (separately \nand combined) can be properly ascertained. In this paper, we present initial results from such a \nstudy, and comment on the implications of the observed levels and variability of the different \nfreshwater inputs. \n \n2. Background \n2.1 Oceanographic context \n \nThe Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (SO GLOBEC) fieldwork area is \ncentred on the central section of the WAP shelf, including Marguerite Bay (Figures 1, 2). \nMarguerite Bay is open to the west, bounded to the north and south by Adelaide Island and \nAlexander Island respectively, and closed to the east by the Antarctic Peninsula. The WAP shelf \nis typically around 450 m deep, with a deep trough, dubbed the Marguerite Trough, running into \n 7\nMarguerite Bay from the shelf edge. Maximum depths of around 1600 m are found close to \nAlexander Island (Figure 2). \n \nThe water mass structure over the WAP continental shelf and in Marguerite Bay is relatively \nstraightforward, and has been described in detail previously (Hofmann et al., 1996; Klinck et al., \n2004; Meredith et al., 2004; Smith et al., 1999). The oceanic source for all other water masses \nfound here is Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). This is the voluminous, mid-depth water mass of \nthe Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the southern boundary of which flows northeastward \nclose to the WAP shelf slope. CDW can intrude onto the WAP shelf in certain locations, and it is \nbelieved that deep troughs that cross the shelf break (e.g. the Marguerite Trough) are important \nfor this transfer. Unlike many other Antarctic shelf regions, there is no Antarctic Slope Front at \nthe outer shelf break and slope (Jacobs, 1991; Whitworth et al., 1998); consequently there is no \ndynamic barrier to the flow of CDW onto the shelf (Talbot, 1988). Momentum advection and \ncurvature of the shelf break are important in driving CDW onto the shelf, following which the \ngeneral shelf circulation can draw the CDW into the interior (Dinniman and Klinck, 2004). In a \nstudy of CDW intrusion onto the shelf along Marguerite Trough, it was deduced that the inflow is \nepisodic, and that 4-6 events can occur in a year (Klinck et al., 2004). \n \nCDW typically has potential temperatures of 1.0-2.0\u00baC and salinities of 34.60-34.74. It is usually \nconsidered as being comprised of two separate water masses, namely Upper CDW (UCDW), \ncharacterised by a relative maximum in potential temperature at a potential density of 27.72, and \nLower CDW (LCDW), characterised by a relative maximum in salinity at a potential density of \n27.80. UCDW is the form of CDW that dominates the deeper layers of the WAP shelf, though \n 8\nLCDW has been observed in the deepest parts of some of the troughs (Klinck et al., 2004). The \nmechanisms by which LCDW intrudes onto the shelf are presently not well known.  \n \nA pycnocline separates the UCDW from the overlying Antarctic Surface Water (AASW). In \nwinter, AASW is a relatively thick layer (typically 50-100 m) of cold water, with temperatures \nclose to the freezing point and salinities around 33.5-34.0. During summer, ice melt freshens the \nvery surface of this layer, which is also warmed by insolation. This warmer, fresher layer is \nundercut by the remnant of the deep winter mixed layer; this is termed Winter Water (WW) \n(Mosby, 1934; Toole, 1981), and is characterised by a minimum in potential temperature. \n \nModification of the shelf UCDW can be explained by a combination of across-shelf diffusion of \nheat and salt from offshore UCDW and vertical diffusion of heat and salt across the permanent \npycnocline into the WW layer (Smith et al., 1999); this does not, however, preclude variability in \nthe advective transfer of UCDW onto the shelf. Diffusive-convective instability is thought to be \nimportant for the upward heat flux across the pycnocline, and it is believed that the UCDW \nintrusions onto the shelf are important in both the heat and salt budgets of the area (Smith and \nKlinck, 2002). They are also likely to be ecologically important. \n \nCirculation on the WAP shelf includes a coastal current that flows southwest along the west coast \nof Adelaide Island and into Marguerite Bay, then around the bay before exiting near Alexander \nIsland (Beardsley et al., 2004; Klinck et al., 2004; Moffat et al., 2007). Its pathway through \nMarguerite Bay is, however, difficult to trace (Moffat et al., 2007). It is believed that this coastal \n 9\ncurrent may result from seasonal buoyancy forcing, primarily due to the input of coastal runoff at \nthe western flank of the WAP (Moffat et al., 2007).  \n \nThere is marked interannual variability in water mass properties in the region. For example, it has \nbeen shown that ocean properties in northern Marguerite Bay show variability in response to \natmospheric and cryospheric forcing associated with the El Ni\u00f1o \/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) \nphenomenon (Meredith et al., 2004). An especially deep winter mixed layer was observed in \nresponse to the strong 1997\/98 El Ni\u00f1o event. This produced a deep (~150 m) and saline (~34.0) \nvariety of WW that persisted into the following summer, with putative biogeochemical and \necological consequences (see Meredith et al. (2004) and Clarke et al. (2007) for discussion). \nConsideration of the forcings indicated that the scale of the ocean response to El Ni\u00f1o covered a \nbroader spatial area than just the northern part of Marguerite Bay, though it was not possible to \ndetermine its full extent.  \n \n2.2 Sea ice characteristics \n \nThe northern part of Marguerite Bay is a seasonally ice covered region. Observations of ice cover \navailable from passive microwave satellite sensors, such as the SSM\/I, show Marguerite Bay \ntypically ice-free (or with low concentrations) from December to March, although the start and \nend dates of the ice-free period can vary from November to January and March to May \nrespectively. The presence of Rothera Research Station on Adelaide Island at the northern head \nof Marguerite Bay (Figures 1, 2) facilitates year-round in situ observations of sea ice \nconcentration and type. Observations have been archived since 1997, and are summarised in \n 10\nFigure 3. They are split into several subsidiary bays: Ryder Bay (where the oceanographic time \nseries is taken) being the most comprehensively archived, although observations for Jenny Bay, \nSouth Cove and Hanger Cove are also available. Ryder Bay is typically largely covered in fast ice \nfrom June to September. There are typically periods of weeks where the fast ice cover is \n10\/10ths, interspersed with periods of a few days of lower concentration where there is clear \nwater or brash ice. Ice free conditions and days with small concentrations of brash ice dominate \nthe rest of the year; it is unusual for there to be multi-year ice.  \n \nThere are sporadic measurements of ice thickness available for Ryder Bay, though by logistical \nnecessity these are only made on \u201csafe\u201d areas of fast sea ice. Depths are typically 0.5 m during \nthe late winter. In heavy ice years, such as 2002, the fast ice can last from May to November, \nwhereas in light ice years, such as 1998, the periods of persistent fast ice can be as short as a few \ndays. Meredith et al. (2004) show time series of monthly-mean sea ice fraction (independent of \nice type) for 1998 to 2002 (their Figure 9). They also describe calculations of ice production, \nbased on a simple 1-dimensional surface energy balance model, which uses primarily in situ \nmeteorological and sea ice observations to calculate ice production amounts. Their Figures 12 \nand 17 illustrate that around 0.01 m of sea ice per day are produced during the freezing season; \naccumulating to (on average) 1.9 m per year.     \n \n2.3 Oxygen isotopes as oceanographic tracers \n \nWhilst measurements of salinity are often sufficient to quantify total freshwater input to the \nocean, they cannot elucidate the relative contributions from different freshwater sources: other \n 11\ntracers are required for this. The ratio of oxygen isotopes in seawater (H218O to H216O) is \nespecially useful in this context (Craig and Gordon, 1965). In general, \u03b418O (the sample ratio of \nH218O to H216O referenced to the international standard, Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water \n(VSMOW)) at the surface of the ocean is increased by evaporation and decreased by \nprecipitation. Away from the surface, \u03b418O is a conservative tracer. In these contexts, it is similar \nto salinity as an ocean tracer. Indeed, it is well known that the surface of much of the world ocean \nshows a quasi-linear relationship between salinity and \u03b418O, with the slope depending on the \nevaporation\/precipitation characteristics of the regions under study.  \n \nUnlike salinity, however, \u03b418O in precipitation decreases with increasing latitude due to its \ncorrelation with temperature. High-latitude precipitation is isotopically light (i.e. depleted in the \nheavier H218O molecule), with \u03b418O values as low as \u201350\u2030 reported (Weiss et al., 1979). The \nisotopically light nature of glacial ice (which is formed from high-latitude precipitation) has \nproved valuable in tracing the input of glacial ice melt to the Antarctic Bottom Water that forms \non the shelves of the continent (e.g. Schlosser et al., 1990; Schlosser et al., 1991; Weiss et al., \n1979; Weppernig et al., 1996). A second important difference between salinity and \u03b418O is their \nbehaviours during sea ice formation and melting. Ocean salinity is strongly affected by these \nprocesses, as a result of brine rejection or freshwater addition. However, \u03b418O is only very \nmarginally affected by these processes, with the fractionation factor for ice in equilibrium with \nseawater being of order 1.0026 to 1.0035 (Lehmann and Siegenthaler, 1991; Macdonald et al., \n1995; Majoube, 1971). The small isotope difference between sea ice and the surface water from \nwhich it formed has been used in various studies to distinguish sea ice melt from meteoric \nfreshwater input (i.e. from freshwater deriving from the atmosphere), which is isotopically much \n 12\nlighter at high latitudes (e.g. Bauch et al., 1995; Jacobs et al., 1985; Meredith et al., 1999; \nMeredith et al., 2001; Schlosser et al., 1994). We use \u03b418O data here in this context. \n \n3. Methods \n \nSince late 1997, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has been conducting the Rothera \nOceanographic and Biological Time Series (RaTS) project in Ryder Bay, close to the BAS \nResearch Station at Rothera on Adelaide Island (Figure 2). As part of RaTS, a Chelsea \nInstruments Aquapack Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) instrument was used to profile \nthe upper-ocean characteristics up to the end of 2002. The instrument package was lowered and \nraised using a hand-cranked winch, with casts limited to a maximum depth of 200 m by the \npressure rating of the instrument (water depth at the sampling site is approximately 400 m). In \nearly 2003, this instrument was replaced by a SeaBird SBE19, the higher pressure rating of which \nhas enabled profiling that approaches the seabed. Both instruments were operated in self-\nrecording mode, with data downloaded immediately after collection at Rothera. Casts were \nconducted from an inflatable boat during the ice-free months of the austral summer, and through \na hole cut in the sea ice during the austral winter.  \n \nPrecision of the CTD data was maintained by performing concurrent casts with SeaBird 911plus \nCTDs during the regular visits of RRS James Clark Ross and ARSV Laurence M. Gould to \nRothera. The SeaBird salinity data were themselves calibrated using discrete samples measured \non a Guildine Autosal 8400B salinometer, standardised with International Association for the \n 13\nPhysical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO) P-series standard seawater. Offsets to the Aquapack and \nSBE19 salinity data were applied to reconcile them with the calibrated SeaBird 911plus data.  \n \nIn addition to the RaTS CTD casts, discrete water samples were taken from 15 m depth at the \nRaTS site using a Niskin bottle closed with a brass messenger. These samples have been used for \na range of purposes, including measurements of size-fractionated chlorophyll and macronutrient \nconcentrations. Since early 2002, samples from these Niskin bottles have also been drawn for \noxygen isotope analysis; here we use data from the years 2002 and 2003. These samples were \nstored in 150 ml medical flat bottles with rubber inserts in the caps; these were sealed with \nParafilm to prevent evaporation. Batches of oxygen isotope samples were transported annually \n(held at +4\u00baC in the dark) to the Natural Environment Research Council Isotope Geosciences \nLaboratory (NIGL, Keyworth, U.K.). The waters were analysed for isotopes using the \nequilibration method for oxygen (Epstein and Mayeda, 1953) and a VG Isoprep 18 and Sira 10 \nmass spectrometer. During CTD casts performed from RRS James Clark Ross, the opportunity \nwas taken to collect several samples from different depth levels, to better elucidate the vertical \ndistribution of the different freshwater components; these vertical profiles of \u03b418O were obtained \nin successive Decembers of 2001, 2002 and 2003. These samples were stored and transported in \nan identical fashion to the RaTS time series samples. All samples were analysed in triplicate to \nensure data integrity; average precision of these samples is better than \u00b1 0.02\u2030. Data are \navailable upon request by contacting the authors. \n \n4. Results \n4.1 Profiles and time series \n 14\n Figure 4 shows the vertical profiles of salinity and \u03b418O obtained during the Decembers of 2001, \n2002 and 2003. The profiles show a broadly similar structure, with the deepest water present \nrepresenting the upper layer of CDW. This is saline compared with the overlying waters \n(approximately 34.62), and relatively isotopically heavy (i.e. relatively enriched in the heavier \nH218O molecule) with \u03b418O values of approximately \u20130.08\u2030. Above this, the profiles become \nfresher and isotopically lighter toward the surface, where values are around 33.7 to 33.8 in \nsalinity, and \u20130.55 to \u20130.60\u2030 in \u03b418O. That the surface waters are both fresh and isotopically \nlight compared with CDW indicates that these waters contained significant meteoric water, not \nsolely sea ice melt. The similarity of the profiles might be taken to suggest minimal interannual \nvariability over this period; however, data with a higher frequency of sampling are needed to \navoid aliassing problems. \n \nThe RaTS CTD time series of salinity, potential temperature and density for the upper 200 m of \nthe water column are shown in Figure 5. For reference, the deeper CTD profiles with full-depth \n\u03b418O data (conducted from RRS James Clark Ross and shown in Figure 4) were performed at the \nstart, middle and end of the sequence shown in Figure 5. The data show seasonal progressions of \nproperties that are relatively typical of this location (e.g. Meredith et al., 2004), with freshest \nsurface water during January-March (around 32.0 to 33.0), and most saline surface water during \nthe austral fall and winter (August-October, around 33.5 to 33.9). Potential temperature is highest \nduring December-February (typically 1-3\u02daC), reaching the surface freezing point by June and \nremaining there until October\/November. Density strongly resembles salinity, as a consequence \nof the equation of state being dominated by salinity at low temperatures. There is some evidence \n 15\nof difference between the two years, particularly in the depth of the winter mixed layer, which is \nconsiderably deeper in 2003 compared with 2002. We believe this is due to variability in the \nlarge-scale atmospheric forcing of the system, and will discuss this separately. \n \nTime series of salinity and potential temperature from 15 m depth in the RaTS CTD data during \n2003 and 2003 are shown in Figure 6 (upper and middle panel). The seasonality is again obvious, \nwith freshest and warmest waters during the austral summer, and high salinities and freezing-\npoint temperatures during the austral winter. Figure 6 (lower panel) shows the corresponding \nseries of \u03b418O from samples collected at 15 m depth. This also shows a marked seasonal signal, \nwith isotopically lightest values (down to \u20130.8 to \u20130.9\u2030) during the austral summer, and \nisotopically heaviest values (up to around \u20130.5\u2030) during the austral winter. This seasonality in \n\u03b418O is a strong indication of seasonality in the meteoric water input to northern Marguerite Bay, \nsince sea ice processes alone would induce seasonality in salinity, but not significantly in \u03b418O. \nNote that, even during winter, the \u03b418O value at 15 m is still much lower than that of the \nunderlying CDW (Figure 4), indicating that significant meteoric water remains in the upper \nlayers of Marguerite Bay throughout the year.  \n \n4.2 Seasonal freshwater loci \n \nFreshwater loci (the evolution in time of the salinity\/\u03b418O relationship) form a useful way of \ndetermining the dominant processes and the temporal variability of their influence. The locus for \nthe 2002 data from the RaTS sampling site is shown in Figure 7. For this diagram, data points \nhave been colour-coded and labelled according to the time of year. Extrapolations between the \n 16\nendpoint of CDW and the meteoric water endmembers (precipitation and glacial meltwater) are \nmarked (dashed lines), along with an approximate median line. (Section 4.3 details the isotope \ncharacteristics of these freshwater sources in more detail). In Figure 7, mixing of Marguerite Bay \nsurface water with CDW would move the data points diagonally upward, along the line toward \nCDW. Conversely, mixing with meteoric water would move the points diagonally downward, \nalong the line toward fresher, isotopically lighter waters. Sea ice processes would move the data \npoints almost horizontally on this diagram. \n \nThe cluster of data points for January (yellow) have salinities of around 33.0-33.4, and \u03b418O \nvalues mostly between \u20130.6 and \u20130.7\u2030. If we consider the November\/December 2002 conditions \n(black data points) to be broadly indicative of the likely conditions in late 2001 (for which we \nhave no \u03b418O data), the shift in the salinity- \u03b418O characteristics from November\/December to \nJanuary would be partly horizontal (to the left) and partly diagonal (toward isotopically light \nfreshwater), and thus a combination of addition of sea ice melt and an addition of meteoric water. \nThe next cluster of points on the locus (February-May; green) represents the freshest and \nisotopically lightest data in the sequence, with salinities as low as 32.9 and \u03b418O less than \n-0.85\u2030. The shift to this cluster is indicative of the addition of substantial quantities of meteoric \nwater, but significantly no sea ice melt is involved (there is no extra horizontal shift relative to \nthe meteoric water envelope lines). The transition to the next cluster (June\/July; red) sees data \npoints moving toward higher salinities and higher \u03b418O values. The cluster moves horizontally \nout of the meteoric water envelope, thus we infer both that both freezing and mixing with CDW \n(as the mixed layer deepens) are important for this transition. The following transition to August-\nOctober (blue points) sees generally higher salinities (around 33.75) with little change in \u03b418O: \n 17\nthis mainly horizontal shift is indicative of the effect of sea ice formation. During \nNovember\/December (black points), salinities and \u03b418O values are concurrently at their highest \n(approximately 33.8 and \u20130.5\u2030 respectively). \n \nThe corresponding locus for 2003 in shown in Figure 8. Whilst there are strong similarities with \nthat of 2002 (Figure 7), there are also clear differences. The locus is clustered much more tightly \nto the meteoric water envelope (dashed lines), indicating less variability in the prevalence of sea \nice melt at 15 m throughout the year. Indeed, only parts of the August-October and \nNovember\/December clusters lie outside the envelope. From November\/December 2002 (Figure \n7) there is a small, predominantly horizontal shift toward January 2003 (yellow cluster, Figure 8), \nindicative of small quantities of sea ice melt. Conversely, during the transition to February-May, \nthe cluster of points remains close to the middle of the meteoric water envelope. This indicates \naddition of meteoric water, and minimal influence of sea ice processes. The locus between \nJune\/July and August-October 2003 (red and blue, Figure 8) lies predominantly (but not \nexclusively) within the meteoric water envelope, indicating mixing with CDW to be dominant \nprocess, but with some sea ice formation occurring also. More mixing with the underlying CDW \nin 2003 compared with 2002 is not unexpected, given the deeper winter mixed layer in 2003.  \n \nIt is important to note that the tighter clustering of the data points to the meteoric water envelope \nin 2003, compared with 2002, indicates only that the sea ice prevalence was less variable at 15m \ndepth during this year, it does not indicate that it was less significant in the water column as a \nwhole. Given the deeper mixed layer in winter 2003, sea ice melt integrated over the mixed layer \n 18\ncould well be more significant in 2003. To fully address this, it is useful to first quantify the \nrelative contributions from the freshwater sources. \n  \n4.3 Quantification of freshwater components \n \nTo quantify the relative prevalence of the respective freshwater contributors, we solved the three-\ncomponent mass balance for each isotope sample collected: \n \nfcdw + fsim + fmet = 1     (1) \nScdw.fcdw + Ssim.fsim + Smet.fmet = S    (2) \n\u03b4cdw.fcdw + \u03b4sim.fsim + \u03b4met.fmet = \u03b4    (3) \n \nwhere: \nfcdw, (sim), [met] is the derived fraction of UCDW, (sea ice melt), [meteoric water],  \nScdw, (sim), [met] is the salinity of the UCDW, (sea ice melt), [meteoric water] endmember, \n\u03b4cdw. (sim), [met] is the \u03b418O of the UCDW, (sea ice melt), [meteoric water] endmember, \nS is the measured salinity, \n\u03b4 is the measured \u03b418O value. \n \nThe choice of values for characteristics of the endmembers (i.e. the undiluted sources prior to \ntheir being mixed to form the waters that were sampled) is important in determining realistic \nfractions for the freshwater contributors. Most of these are already clearly established, but others \n(such as the average \u03b418O of meteoric water) are less well known. We have instigated a program \n 19\nof measuring these endmembers more thoroughly, but for the purposes of the present paper we \nhave adopted the following values (summarized in Table 1). The meteoric water endmember \nsalinity is set to 0. The CDW endmember salinity is set to 34.62; this is the deepest value \nobtained during the vertical profiling at the RaTS site. Note that this value does not represent \n\u201cpure\u201d CDW in the ACC, but rather best depicts the local variety to which freshwater is added. \nThe CDW \u03b418O is set to \u20130.08\u2030; again, this is the deepest value obtained during the vertical \nprofiling at the RaTS site, and is used for the same reasons given above. The sea ice melt salinity \nendmember is set to 7, which is a representative value for the region under study. The \u03b418O \nendmember value for sea ice is set to +2.1\u2030, derived as a realistic \u03b418O value of the surface \nwater for this area plus an offset to account for fractionation upon freezing.  \n \nThe largest uncertainties are associated with the choice of \u03b418O value for the meteoric water \nendmember. This is because it is a combination of local precipitation (which can have a large \ndegree of variability if measured directly), and glacial ice melt. Glacial ice melt itself can be in \nthe form of surface runoff, or melt from a glacier or ice shelf in direct contact with the ocean. \nPrecipitation and glacial ice melt can have different \u03b418O values, since precipitation that is \nincorporated into glaciers may have accumulated at different surface elevations and\/or can have \nfallen during a time of different climatic conditions. The isotope values of the different terms in \nthe mass balance of the northern end of George VI ice shelf (which calves into Marguerite Bay) \nwere discussed previously by (Potter and Paren, 1985). They observed that the ice flux into the \nshelf had a \u03b418O value of around \u201320\u2030, whereas direct accumulation onto the northern part of the \nice shelf in the form of precipitation had a much higher \u03b418O value, around \u201313\u2030. Accordingly, \nwe have adopted a value of \u201317\u2030 as a reasonable mean \u03b418O value of the meteoric endmember \n 20\nin our freshwater balance, though with large associated uncertainty. Errors in the derived \nfreshwater percentages resulting from uncertainty in choice of endmember (determined through \nsensitivity studies) and measurement error are typically around \u00b1 1%. \n \nThe results of these calculations are shown in Figure 9, the upper curve of which shows the \ntemporal evolution of the meteoric water percentage at 15 m depth, and the lower curve of which \nshows the corresponding sea ice melt percentages. Note that the sea ice melt percentages are \nfrequently negative; this indicates that at the time of sampling, there had been a net sea ice \nformation from these waters. Meteoric water percentages vary between nearly 5% during the late \naustral summer and fall to less than 3% during the austral winter. Sea ice melt percentages vary \nbetween 0-1% during the austral summer, to \u20131 to \u20132% during the austral winter.  \n \nIt should be noted that the meteoric water prevalence is always higher than the sea ice prevalence, \ndemonstrating clearly the importance of meteoric water inputs at this location. The seasonality in \nthe meteoric water is comparable to that in the sea ice melt (around 2% range in both years, \ncompared with ~2% and 1% for sea ice melt in 2002 and 2003 respectively). This indicates that \nassumptions of freshwater seasonality being controlled predominantly by sea ice formation and \nmelting in Antarctic coastal waters are not necessarily valid. We note that Ryder Bay, although \nbeing fairly open, is surrounded by glaciers which may have increased the glacial meltwater input \nat the RaTS site above that typical for the WAP shelf as a whole. \n \nAs observed above, the sea ice melt at 15 m is much less variable in 2003 compared with 2002. \nIn particular, during the months July through October, the values for sea ice melt are around \u20130.5 \n 21\nto \u20131.0% in 2003, compared with around \u20131.5% in 2002. However, the mixed layer was much \ndeeper in 2003, down to around 180 m in August and averaging around 120 m for July to \nOctober (Figure 5). During 2002, the mixed layer for the same period was approximately one \nthird as deep, around 40 m. If we assume momentarily that the freshwater fractions derived for \n15 m depth are spread equally over the full depth of the mixed layer, then the integrated sea ice \nmelt percentages in 2003 become comparable to those in 2002, and very possibly larger. \n \nWe should note that the above calculation makes a number of assumptions, for example it ignores \nthe possibility of changes in freshwater content beneath the mixed layer in the underlying \npycnocline. With data from just one level (15 m), we cannot fully quantify the separate integrated \nfreshwater components in the upper ocean as a function of time. However, using the full-depth \nprofiles of \u03b418O obtained from RRS James Clark Ross during the Decembers of 2001, 2002 and \n2003, we can at least calculate the freshwater inventories at these times. To do this, we first \ncalculated the relative freshwater percentages for these profiles using Equations 1-3 above. The \nresults of this are shown in Figure 10, from which it can be seen that the meteoric water content \ngreatly exceeds the sea ice melt content. Meteoric water content reaches 3% at the surface, whilst \nsea ice melt content at the surface is between \u20130.5 and \u20131.0%. To quantify the total freshwater \ncomponents present in the water column at the time of sampling, we integrated the derived \nfractions with depth: \n \n\u222b= 0\nZ\nmet met\nmax\ndzf  H      (4) \n \n 22\ndz f H\n0\nZ\nsimsim\nmax\n\u222b=      (5) \n \nwhere  Hmet is the column inventory of meteoric water, \n Hsim is the column inventory of sea ice melt, \n Zmax is the deepest level over which the profile is integrated. \n \nThe results of these calculations are shown in Figure 10. Meteoric water inventories were \nbetween around 4.0 and 4.5 m, with uncertainty of around 1 m. Sea ice melt inventories were \naround \u20131 m, with similar uncertainty. Accounting for the difference in density between water \nand ice (ratio of around 0.9), this would indicate that a net amount of around 1.1 m of sea ice had \nbeen formed from the water column at the time of sampling, although the uncertainty in this \nestimate is large. Note that this does not imply that sea ice of this thickness of existed in \nMarguerite Bay at the time; rather it is indicative of the net thickness of sea ice that had formed \nfrom the water column up to the time it was sampled. \n \nIt is also important to note that the quantified prevalences of sea ice melt and meteoric water are \nfrom just one location, and previous observations (Meredith et al., 2004) indicate that oceanic \nadvection is important in controlling the temporally-evolving properties in northern Marguerite \nBay. The importance of advection to the freshwater budget of this area is seen further from \ncalculations of local ice production per unit area, made with a one-dimensional model and using \nforcings derived from meteorological and sea-ice observations collected at the nearby Rothera \nResearch Station. Details of the ice production model and its application to the Marguerite Bay \nregion have been described previously (Meredith et al., 2004; Renfrew et al., 2002).  \n 23\n Annual ice production derived using this model was 2.97m in 2001, 0.98m in 2002, and 2.80m in \n2003. The lower ice production in 2002 was primarily due to a generally high sea ice fraction \nduring the winter months, which cut off further sea ice production, and also contributed to the \nrelatively shallow mixed-layer (Figure 5) by limiting wind-induced oceanic mixing.  Whilst the \n2002 value agrees well with the isotope-derived value for ice formation of 1m, especially given \nthe significant uncertainty in this value, the 2001 and 2003 values do not. The discrepancy arises \nbecause the model quantifies ice production at a single location, whereas the isotope-derived \nvalue inherently includes waters that are advected through the sampling area, and which may \nhave received freshwater inputs at significant distances from the RaTS site. It has been \ndemonstrated already that the RaTS hydrographic data show variability in response to changes in \nlarge-scale forcing and climate variability (Meredith et al., 2004), rather than changes in purely \nlocal conditions, and clearly this is equally significant for more exotic tracers such as oxygen \nisotopes. It is important to bear this in mind when interpreting the results presented here. \n \n6. Discussion and Conclusions \n \nWhilst the tracers we have used (salinity, \u03b418O) are not capable of distinguishing glacial ice melt \nseparately from direct precipitation into the ocean, there are good reasons to suspect that the \nglacial ice melt component is the largest contributor to the meteoric water. For example, during \n2002, there is a phase difference between the peak freshwater prevalences (Figure 9). The sea ice \nmelt percentage peaked in late January, whereas the meteoric water did not peak until March. \nThis indicates that the meteoric water was not dominated by snow that had accumulated on top of \n 24\nthe sea ice during winter, else they would have peaked at the same time. The difference in the \ntimes of peaking therefore reflects the time for maximum glacial runoff to reach the RaTS \nsampling site. \n \nA further indication of the relative importances of glacial ice melt and precipitation in the \nmeteoric water input to the ocean is provided from meteorological analyses. Note that \nmeasurements of precipitation in this region are sparse, and it is difficult to distinguish incident \nprecipitation from blowing snow. Therefore, we instead examined the output of a regional \natmospheric model, integrated for 7 years with a horizontal grid spacing of 14 km and \nrealistically forced at the boundaries (Van Lipzig et al., 2004). Figure 11 shows the precipitation \naveraged over Marguerite Bay; it can be seen that average precipitation into Marguerite Bay is of \norder 0.1 m per month (around 1.2 m annual average), with a significant semiannual term \nsuperposed. Whilst there is uncertainty concerning the rate at which this precipitation is mixed to \ndeeper layers in the ocean or advected away from the region of input, this is significantly less \nthan the column inventory of meteoric water measured at the RaTS site in December (around \n4 m). This again suggests glacial ice melt to be the dominant source of meteoric water input.  \n \nThe significant amounts of glacial ice melt input to the ocean has important consequences for \nboth the physical and biological systems. The freezing point of water is a function of salinity, \nthus the input of glacial ice melt will act to influence further sea ice production. This will \nsubsequently impact on local processes such as air-sea fluxes of heat, momentum, and so on. \nThere are large-scale consequences also; for example, studies with coupled climate models have \nindicated that enhanced freshwater inputs to the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula can, over \n 25\nlong periods, induce changes in ocean temperature, salinity and isopycnal depth in the tropical \nAtlantic (Hickey and Weaver, 2004). Indeed, this mechanism was put forward as a possible \nexplanation for an observed decadal mode of tropical Atlantic variability. \n \nGlacial ice inputs are known to be important for ecosystem dynamics in Antarctic waters. Glacial \nmeltwater can by enriched in iron and other micronutrients, and thereby constitute a source of \nessential trace micronutrients for offshore waters, with consequences for primary production \nthere (Dierssen et al., 2002). Release of glacial meltwater will also act to stabilise the water \ncolumn. This will have the action of retaining phytoplankton within a favourable light \nenvironment by reducing the depth of mixing, and it is known that water column stability and a \nshallow mixed layer are critical for phytoplankton bloom development in this region (Mitchell \nand Holm-Hansen, 1991). There will also be secondary consequences of a shallower mixed layer \nand larger concentrations of phytoplankton. For example, these factors will tend to restrict heat \ninput from the atmosphere to shallower depths, by blocking the downward penetration of \nradiation and restricting the depth of mixing of warmed surface waters. This will tend to produce \nwarmer surface waters, again with impacts on sea ice production and associated biogeochemical \nand ecological functions. \n \nThe seasonal cycles of meteoric water and sea ice melt fractions that we have derived represent \nthe present-day situation at the western Peninsula, following at least 50 years of rapid regional \nclimate change. As this change continues, the mean prevalence and seasonality in the freshwater \nfractions will undoubtedly change also. For example, the majority of glaciers on the Peninsula are \nretreating, and this retreat is accelerating (Cook et al., 2005). It is also known that the annual \n 26\nmelting period has been increasing at the Peninsula, at a rate of around half a day per year \n(Torinesi et al., 2003). These changes will act to increase the prevalence of meteoric water, and \nare also likely to increase the magnitude of its seasonality (c.f. Figure 9).  \n \nAlthough data from the pre-satellite era are sparse, indications are that the sea ice extent in the \nBellingshausen Sea has decreased significantly since the 1950s (King and Harangozo, 1998). For \nthe satellite era, various studies have shown geographically-significant patterns of sea ice \nchanges. It has been shown that sea ice duration in the region west of the Peninsula has decreased \nin duration by around 1-2 days per year (Parkinson, 2002; Vaughan et al., 2003). It is worth \nnoting that the atmospheric warming trend at the Peninsula is strongest during April-September, \ncoinciding with the time of strongest sea ice formation. Overall, these changes (if continued) are \nlikely to be represented as a \u201cflattening\u201d of the seasonal sea ice melt curve (c.f. Figure 9), with \nless positive sea ice melt during summer and less negative sea ice melt during winter. This \naccords well with observations of previous changes in surface ocean salinity in the \nBellingshausen Sea during the second half of the last century (Meredith and King, 2005), where a \nstrong summer salinification was observed, driven by mixed layer processes associated with \nreduced sea ice production. This summer salinification is equivalent to a long-term reduction in \nthe summer prevalence of sea ice melt, and would be seen as a reduction in the seasonality of the \nsea ice melt curve (Figure 9). \n \nIt has been shown previously that winter mixed layer depths in the region of Marguerite Bay and \nthe WAP depend critically on the rate of sea ice production (Meredith et al., 2004; Smith and \nKlinck, 2002). The changes that have been observed at the WAP include a reduction in sea ice \n 27\nformation; this will act to reduce the mixed layer depths, with likely impacts on biogeochemical \nprocesses and primary production. \n \nUnlike many regions around Antartica, the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula is not one \nwhere appreciable quantities of dense water are formed on the shelf. Consequently, for example, \nthere are no major sources of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) in this sector of the Southern \nOcean. However, downslope convection of dense water from the shelf has been observed \noccurring in front of Elephant Island, at the very tip of the Peninsula (Meredith et al., 2003), with \nsubsequent ventilation of the deep CDW and AABW layers. Sea ice production is believed to be \nimportant to the production of this dense water, by adding salt to the shelf waters during winter. \nIf the climate change continues in this region, extending to the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, this \nmode of ventilating the deep Southern Ocean may be shut off. \n \nWe note that our time series reflects the temporal evolution of freshwater characteristics at just \none location. However, it has been seen previously (and is reiterated here) that this location is \nsensitive to large-scale climate change and variability (Meredith et al., 2004), and we believe it is \nlikely to give indications of conditions and processes at broader scales than purely local. The \nwintertime data we are able to acquire from this location makes the series especially valuable in \nmonitoring the evolving physical and ecological systems, since this is when some of the key \nprocesses occur (sea ice production, mixed layer deepening, mixing with CDW etc.). As climate \nchange continues at the WAP, monitoring programs such as RaTS will continue to track the \necosystem\u2019s response. Continued time series measurements of oxygen isotopes, using the \n 28\nmeasurements presented here as a baseline, will enable determination of the changes in \nfreshwater forcings, and the ecosystem changes that are induced in response. \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe thank Rayner Piper, Andrew Miller and the Boating Officers at Rothera for undertaking the \ncollection of data and samples used in this paper.
