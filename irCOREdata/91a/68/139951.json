In every issue of business strategy review we\nprovide an update on what some of the world's leading thinkers are currently working on.\nFrancesca Cornelli\nAcademic (London Business School)\nRecent work: Co-author of The Global Economic Impact of Private Equity Report 2008 (World Economic Forum,\n2008)\nTwo of the main projects I am working on concern private equity. The first looks at the boards of public companies\nthat have gone through a leveraged buyout and, as a result, become private companies. We look at the presence of\nprivate equity people on the boards and whether that relates to how difficult a deal was or to the outcome. We find\nevidence that private equity people become more involved in the most difficult deals and have a positive impact on\nthe final outcome.\nAnother thing we are looking at concerns management. There\u2019s a debate about whether managers in public\ncompanies are dismissed when they perform badly or when the industry is in crisis. There is some evidence that\nthey\u2019re actually dismissed when the industry is in crisis \u2013 something that is clearly not their fault. This is therefore\ninefficient. We look at whether the firing of managers in private equity companies is more efficient. Very often the\nmanagers of companies that underwent leveraged buyouts talk about having longer-term objectives and not\nneeding to focus on short-term profits. Contrary to such claims, we find management turnover in those companies\nis much higher. However, we also find that private equity companies are more willing and able to fire people based\non the poor performance of the company rather than of the industry or market.\nI am also looking at the entire issue of transparency. Following various corporate scandals, the argument put\nforward is that more transparency is better. Actually, you can argue that transparency can make matters worse.\nWhen you make more information available, managers\u2019 compensation may be affected and, therefore, the\nbehaviour of managers may change. They will have more incentives to manipulate the additional information,\nsince the public is more likely to rely on such information when valuing the company. Calls for transparency are\nusually based on present management behaviour; but this is misleading, because as managers are not currently\ndisclosing this additional information and are not compensated on the basis of it, they are not taking into account\nthe effect of the additional disclosure when they make decisions. If such changes will actually be implemented,\nmanagers\u2019 compensation will be affected and so will their decisions.\nRichard D\u2019Aveni\nAcademic (Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College)\nRecent work: Hypercompetition (Free Press, 1994), Strategic Supremacy (Free Press, 2001) and Beating the\nCommodity Trap (Harvard Business School Press, 2009)\nI have been looking at the perils of commoditization and, in particular, what I call the commodity trap \u2013 the title of\nmy new book. The basis of my thinking is that long-term competitive advantages are no longer appropriate,\nrelevant or effective. In an increasingly hypercompetitive world, strategy is about sequencing lots of short-term\nadvantages and exploring your way forward. For most companies, that means learning to live with creeping\ncommoditization.\nThe trouble is that most managers approach this problem from the wrong standpoint. Conventional wisdom on\nhow to cope with commoditization suggests there is one simple solution: differentiation. That is a misconception \u2013\nand a dangerous one at that. My research shows that when you are fighting a commodity trap, even continuous\ndifferentiation will not suffice.\nLet\u2019s be clear: adding bells and whistles, or augmenting products or services to differentiate your products or\nservices from those of competitors, can be a powerful tool for escaping the commodity trap in the short run. But\nrivals are usually quick to follow, and there is sometimes no place to run or hide. Typically, firms pursuing\ncontinuous differentiation end up trapped in an endless race that improves products but not profits. What they need\nis a more sophisticated approach that gives them more long-term control of the situation. And that, I hope, is what\nBeating the Commodity Trap provides.\nAndrew Kakabadse\nAcademic (Cranfield University School of Management)\nRecent work: Leading the Board (Palgrave, 2007)\nWhat I am working on at the moment goes back to an experience I had in the mid-1990s when I was invited to an\noutlying province of China called Hunan. I was there acting as an advisor to a multinational company setting up in\nthe area. On arriving, I was introduced to the Chinese minister and offered a refreshing, if potent, local rice wine\ncalled Maotai. No negotiations, I was told, would take place until the local customs were complete. What I later\nrealized was that in this particular province, strangers are required to drink 19 shots of the local liquor to prove\nthey are worthy to be admitted to the negotiating table. Drawing on my early experiences, I drained my glass \u2013 21\ntimes. By still being able to walk after 21 shots of rice wine, I passed the test. The hangover was memorable,\nthough temporary, but the metaphor remained with me.\nSince then I have observed time and time again how local culture and global leadership are entwined. Every\nsituation is different. Every country and even every province has its own unique ways and nuances. Global citizens\nbeware. What is regarded as unprofessional in one part of the world is a test of a leader\u2019s character in another.\nWhat is seen as corruption in one place is seen as deep-seated familial loyalty in another. But it is only by\nnavigating the differences that business leaders can operate effectively on the global stage. And when it comes to\nglobal commerce, Western leaders have as much to learn as, if not more than, their Eastern counterparts.\nI am now working on a book that looks at what it takes to succeed as a global leader of a modern organization.\nRosabeth Moss Kanter\nAcademic (Harvard Business School)\nRecent work: Confidence (Three Rivers Press, 2006) and SuperCorp: How Vanguard Companies Create\nInnovation, Profits, Growth, and Social Good (Crown, 2009)\nMy new book, to be published later this year, is about a handful of companies that set a model for how values and\nprinciples can drive every aspect of a business \u2013 strategies, innovation models, sources of innovation, approaches\nto acquisitions and merger integration, workplaces, the new shape of careers, and influence in the workplace. It\u2019s\nalso about their approaches to diversity, a major issue as companies increasingly globalize whether they operate\noutside of their home country or not. I also consider their contributions to the public sphere. At each of the\ncompanies we investigated, we conducted interviews; in many cases we did 50\u201375 interviews. I ended up with\nabout 375 interviews in 20 countries.\nMy conclusion is that this set of companies, while not perfect, still represents a source of hope for the world; and\nthey could potentially even serve as a buffer against oppressive governments and oppressive religions \u2013 even\noppressive ideologies \u2013 because they have an interest that transcends the merely cosmetic. They have an interest in\nimproving standards around the world, and they tend to carry these standards with them from place to place.\nThese companies \u2013 what I call supercorps \u2013 manage to be very large and yet highly personalized in the ways they\nconnect to people and the ways they allow identity to be expressed. They are global in orientation and in their\nthinking and yet are intensely local and locally embedded in their on the-ground activities.\nThe changes they\u2019ve made are very 21st-century. For most of the companies \u2013 which include IBM, Procter &\nGamble, Cemex, ICICI Bank in India, and Omron in Japan \u2013 the emphasis on their values and principles as\nguidance systems for every aspect of the company is really a 21st-century emphasis. They may have had\nstatements before that, but they were all renewed, refurbished, and updated to fit the new realities and are much\nmore apparent as a management tool than they had been previously.\nMarkus Reitzig\nAcademic (London Business School)\nRecent work: (with Joachim Henkel) \u201cPatent sharks\u201d (Harvard Business Review, June 2008)\nIf you look at all the mega trends \u2013 climate change, population growth and so on, all can be seen as threats or\nopportunities. Managers who view them as opportunities can, despite all the associated uncertainty, be sure of one\nthing: innovative solutions are needed and will sell. As a result, the study of \u201cinnovation\u201d has gained a lot of\nattention. In this domain, you can talk much of people, procedures and processes, but undoubtedly the solutions\nwill have a lot to do with technology, technology that we currently don\u2019t have control over and that needs to be\ndeveloped. How to make money through technological innovation is thus more topical than ever, and the literature\non value creation through technology is rich. One thing people haven\u2019t written so much about, however, is who\ngets the highest return on investment in this whole technology game and captures most value. Interestingly, these\nare not necessarily the most creative, technologically advanced or the most futuristic firms. Finally, we know even\nless about how value creation and value capture in the technology game are related; in other words, how a firm\nshould strategically go about developing technology contingent on its appropriation strategy.\nThis myopia is undesired, yet easily understood. If you look at the history of strategy, everyone\u2019s theoretically\nconcerned with three things: value creation, value appropriation and how they are linked. Yet, because creation is\nthe seemingly sexy part, that is what most people write about. Creation is the thing that resonates with managers,\nbut a lot of profit differences are driven by appropriation. And innovation strategies that tailor initial value creation\nto the envisaged exploitation appear to be the most profitable.\nWhy did Motorola make more money in its GSM venture than any other firm? Not because it was necessarily more\ninventive, not because it had the better technology, but it participated in the technology game with an eye on what\nit could finally drive home. In contrast, other companies started to invest hoping that in the end there would be\nsomething for everybody out there.\nIBM donated 500 patents to the open source community, basically because it understands that if you want to\nmanage that trade-off between value creation and value appropriation, there are certain actions you need to take\nthat can seem counterintuitive at first sight.\nThe biggest challenge in innovation management, and indeed strategic management, is to understand how certain\nfirms make more money than others, despite drawing on similar resources. I am fundamentally concerned in my\nresearch with answering two questions: how do I make more money out of my technology investment than\nsomeone who is technologically equally capable? And how can I strategically tailor my early-stage value-creation\nactivities to subsequent exploitation?\nThere are a number of strands to this research. First, I am looking at how companies can use all of the options that\nthe legal system gives them to appropriate returns for their innovation investment. Particularly, I wonder how legal\nappropriation considerations influence early stage R&D decisions.\nSecond, in the area of open source, I\u2019m trying to understand how it can happen that firms apparently turn the\nsystem of intellectual property rights around by making their costly exclusion rights accessible to the public. What\nmy co-authors and I appear to find in the data we\u2019re currently collecting is that benefits accrue to firms that are\ntrying to shape an open movement so that it perfectly suits their corporate purposes. This is a very sophisticated\napproach to managing the trade-off between the creation and appropriation of value.\nAnother research project I\u2019m working on with several partners is trying to understand how to custom tailor\ncorporate idea generation so it will yield the highest number of actually useable ideas. Behind this, we always have\nan eye on the fact that innovation is about more than just generation of value. It is about the generation conditional\non the expected exploitation of value. Firms do not care about making the pie as big as possible, they do not care\nabout getting the biggest slice of any given cake \u2013 they care about how much finally ends up on their plate.\nFons Trompenaars\nFounder of Trompenaars Hampden-Turner, an Amsterdam-based consultancy.\nRecent work: Author of the bestselling Riding the Waves of Culture (Nicholas Brealey, 1997) and Riding the\nWhirlwind(Infinite Ideas, 2007).\nOur next book will be on the integral organization, in which we will discuss sustainability and reconciling what we\ncall the 10 Golden Dilemmas. This is an enormous piece of work, and that\u2019s why the book has already been\nsimmering in the background for seven years. In our database we have about 8,000 dilemmas which we have\ncaptured via our client work. We have categorized them and have come out with 24 succinct and distinct families\nof dilemmas, of which global versus local or equal opportunity\nare still in the process of conducting research.\nThere are five stakeholders in a business\nThe value of an organization is created by how one reconciles th\ninterconnect these five stakeholders. These dilemmas exist because resources are scarce: what is given to one\nsegment of the cycle must be taken from another. The solution to these dilemmas exists with created value,\nmany cases a new value, making a company highly sustainable. This also ties to our most recent book, Servant\nLeadership Across Cultures (Infinite Ideas, 2008), whereby servant\nindividual level.\nThe other thing we are doing with the dilemmas is measuring where companies position themselves on each\ndilemma, including the viewpoints of a selection of the other stakeholders. What we have found up until now is\nthat there is a high correlation between the compani\ntheir organization. This allows us to create an assessment of the organization, not looking back as most accountants\nwould do, but predicting the sustainability of the organization. And that\u2019s wh\ndilemmas, assessing the sustainability and providing a practical guide on how to reconcile that dilemma, providing\nbest practices and linking it to the value of an organization\nperformance. A great tool, especially in these tough times.\nKim Warren\nAcademic (London Business School)\nRecent work: Strategic Management Dynamics (Wiley, 2008)\nGiven the gratifying early interest in Strategic Management Dynamics, I now find my\ntreadmill of keeping it up to date, both\nAlthough primarily intended as a core MBA strategy textbook, it is also proving popular with strategy\nprofessionals in consulting and corporate staff positions.\nEarly feedback suggests that the book is proving popular because it addresses some long\nthe strategy community \u2013 the limitations of qualitative strategy tools, low popularity with stude\nstrategy courses, and recruiters\u2019 concern about limited capability among their new hires.
