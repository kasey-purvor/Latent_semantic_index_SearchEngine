In principle, the Lyman series lines should be equally useful but,\nlying in the far-ultraviolet (FUV), are only accessible from space. Nevertheless, there are\nsituations (for example, where the optical white dwarf spectrum is highly contaminated by\nthe presence of a companion) in which use of the Lyman series may be essential. Therefore,\nit is important to establish whether or not the Lyman lines provide an equally valid means\nof measurement. We have already made a first attempt to study this problem, comparing\nLyman line measurements from a variety of FUV instruments with ground-based Balmer line\nstudies. Within the measurement uncertainties, we found the results from each line series to\nbe broadly in agreement. However, we noted a number of potential systematic effects that\ncould bias either measurement. With the availability of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic\nExplorer (FUSE) data archive and observations from our own Guest Observer programmes,\nwe now have an opportunity to examine the use of the Lyman series in more detail from\nobservations of 16 DA white dwarfs. Here we have data produced by a single instrument and\nprocessed with a uniform data reduction pipeline, eliminating some of the possible systematic\ndifferences between observations of the same or different stars. We have also examined the\nscatter in values derived from multiple observations of the same star, which is significant.\nThe new results partially reproduce the earlier study, showing that Balmer and Lyman line\ndetermined temperatures are in good agreement up to \u223c50 000 K. However, above this value\nthere is an increasing systematic difference between the Lyman and Balmer line results, the\nformer yielding the higher temperature. At the moment, there is no clear explanation of this\neffect but we think that it is most likely associated with deficiencies in the detailed physics\nincorporated into the stellar model atmosphere calculations. Even so, the data do demonstrate\nthat, for temperatures below 50 000 K, the Lyman lines give reliable results. Furthermore,\nfor the hotter stars, a useful empirical calibration of the relationship between the Lyman and\nBalmer measurements has been obtained, which can be applied to other FUSE observations.\nKey words: stars: atmospheres \u2013 white dwarfs \u2013 ultraviolet: stars.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nIn seeking to understand the evolution of white dwarf stars, two\nof the most important measurements that can be made are of the\neffective temperature (T eff) and surface gravity of any individual\n\u0002E-mail: mab@star.le.ac.uk\nobject. A key breakthrough in this area was the realization that both\nT eff and log g could be determined from the shape and strength\nof the profiles of the Balmer absorption lines visible in the opti-\ncal spectra. This technique was pioneered by Holberg et al. (1985)\nand extended to a large sample of white dwarfs by Bergeron, Saf-\nfer & Liebert (1992). Combining their results with the theoretical\nwhite dwarf evolutionary models of Wood (1992), Bergeron et al.\n(1992) were able to study the mass distribution of stars in detail.\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS\nWhite dwarf temperatures and gravities 563\nSubsequent studies have taken account of the effects of thin exter-\nnal layers of non-degenerate H and He in the evolutionary models\n(Wood 1995) and, more recently, the prior evolution of the pre-white\ndwarf (Blo\u00a8cker 1995; Driebe et al. 1998).\nDuring the past decade, the Balmer line technique has become\nthe standard method for studying white dwarfs hotter than 10 000\u2013\n12 000 K. Above this temperature range, the Balmer line strengths\nare monotonic functions of T eff and problems associated with in-\ncluding convection are much diminished. Such work has under-\npinned the value of various other optical white dwarf surveys (Bra-\ngaglia, Renzini & Bergeron 1995; Finley, Koester & Basri 1997)\nand of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray-selected white dwarf\nsamples (Fleming et al. 1996; Marsh et al. 1997; Vennes et al. 1997;\nNapiwotzki 1999). In these samples, the majority of the stars are iso-\nlated objects. If any are in binaries, they are either wide, resolved sys-\ntems or the companions are late-type dwarfs, where the white dwarf\ncan be spectroscopically isolated. However, when a white dwarf bi-\nnary companion is spatially unresolved and of type K or earlier, the\nwhite dwarf signature is hidden in the glare of the more luminous\nobject and, therefore, the Balmer lines cannot be used for determina-\ntion of T eff or log g. A well-known illustration of this problem is the\nDA + K star binary V471 Tauri, which has been extensively studied\nand where the Lyman series spectrum obtained by the Orbiting and\nRetrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometers (ORFEUS)\nmission was used to obtain the first accurate measurements of T eff\nand log g (Barstow et al. 1997).\nA major result of the EUV sky surveys conducted by ROSAT and\nthe Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) was the discovery of many\nunresolved binary systems containing white dwarfs and companion\nspectral types ranging from A to K (Barstow et al. 1994b; Burleigh,\nBarstow & Fleming 1997; Vennes, Christian & Thorstensen 1998).\nTherefore, a large pool of potential sources exists, for which Ly-\nman series observations are essential to determine T eff and log g.\nSuch information can then be coupled with dynamical information\nfrom the binary and a Hipparcos parallax, measured for the bright\ncompanion to provide model-independent estimates of white dwarf\nmass, testing the evolutionary theories that have been applied to the\nstudies of large isolated samples of white dwarfs.\nWhile the Lyman \u03b1 line is encompassed by the spectral cover-\nage of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST), a single line cannot provide an unambigu-\nous measurement of T eff and log g. Access to the full Lyman series\nlines has been provided by the short duration Hopkins Ultraviolet\nTelescope (HUT) and ORFEUS missions. They provided observa-\ntions of a number of white dwarfs at wavelengths down to the Lyman\nlimit, yielding a first opportunity to compare Balmer and Lyman line\nmeasurements systematically. In a previous paper (Barstow et al.\n2001), we carried out an evaluation of all the available archival data\nfor these missions, including some early spectra from the Far Ultra-\nviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Comparing the results with\nthose from the standard Balmer line analysis, we found general over-\nall good agreement between the two methods. However, significant\ndifferences are noted for a number of stars. These differences are not\nalways consistent in that sometimes the Balmer temperature exceeds\nthat derived from the Lyman lines and in other instances is lower.\nThis is not what would be expected if the problems arose from the\nlimitations of the stellar atmosphere calculations and the treatment\nof the Lyman and Balmer line broadening. We concluded that it is\nmore likely that we were observing systematic effects arising from\nthe observations, the data reduction and the analysis.\nIn this new paper, we re-examine the issue of the Lyman line anal-\nysis with a greatly expanded far-ultraviolet (FUV) data set available\nfrom the FUSE archive. These spectra cover the complete Lyman\nline series from \u03b2 to the series limit, excluding Lyman \u03b1. It is now\npossible to consider a larger number of stars, particularly at values of\nT eff above 50 000 K, a range that was sparsely sampled by Barstow\net al. (2001). In addition, FUSE has observed some of the targets\nmany times, for purposes of monitoring the instrument calibration.\nStudy of the variation in T eff and log g within these is a powerful\ntool for examining systematic effects in the instrument and analysis\nprocedure.\n2 O B S E RVAT I O N S\n2.1 Lyman line spectra\nAll the FUV spectra for 16 DA white dwarfs utilized in the present\npaper were obtained by the FUSE spectrographs and cover the full\nLyman series, with the exception of Lyman \u03b1. Table 1 summarizes\nall the observations, taken by us from the Multimission Archive\n(http:\/\/archive.stsci.edu\/mast.html), hosted by the Space Telescope\nScience Institute. Although flux calibrated data are available in\nthe archive, after processing through the FUSE data pipeline, we\nhave reprocessed the data ourselves to provide better control of the\nquality and a completely uniform calibration, which may vary ac-\ncording to the age of the processed data in the archive. We discuss\nthe data selection and processing below.\nThe FUSE mission was placed in low Earth orbit on 1999 June 24.\nAfter several months of in-orbit checkout and calibration activities,\nscience operations began during 1999 December. Therefore, approx-\nimately three years of data now reside in the archive. An overview\nof the mission is given by Moos et al. (2000) and its in-orbit per-\nformance is described by Sahnow et al. (2000). The spectrograph is\ndescribed in detail by Green, Wilkinson & Friedman (1994). Fur-\nther useful information is included in the FUSE Observer\u2019s Guide\n(Oegerle et al. 2002), which can be found with other technical doc-\numentation on the FUSE website (http:\/\/fuse.pha.jhu.edu).\nAlthough a large number of scientific papers have been published\nincorporating FUSE data, there are several of instrumental issues\nthat affect the quality and usefulness of the spectra in this analysis.\nTherefore, we give a brief description of the spectrometer and its\ncurrent status in this context. Based on a Rowland circle design, it\ncomprises four separate optical paths (or channels). Each of these\nconsists of a mirror, a focal plane assembly (including the spec-\ntrograph apertures), a diffraction grating and a section of one of\ntwo detectors. The channels must be co-aligned so that light from\na single target properly illuminates all four channels, to maximize\nthe throughput of the instrument. Two mirrors and two gratings\nare coated with SiC to provide sensitivity at wavelengths below\n\u223c1020 A\u02da, while the other two mirror\/grating pairs are coated with\nLiF on Al. This latter combination yields about twice the reflectivity\nof SiC at wavelengths above 1050 A\u02da, but has little reflectivity below\n1020 A\u02da. The overall wavelength coverage runs from 905 to 1187 A\u02da.\nSpectra from the four channels are recorded on two microchannel\nplate detectors, with a SiC and LiF spectrum on each. Each detector\nis divided into two functionally independent segments (A and B),\nseparated by a small gap. Consequently, there are eight detector\nsegment\/spectrometer channel combinations to be dealt with in\nreducing the data. The nominal wavelength ranges of these are\nlisted in Table 2. Maintaining the co-alignment of individual\nchannels has been difficult in-orbit, probably due to thermal effects.\nA target may completely miss an aperture for the whole or part of\nan observation, while being well centred in the others.

To minimize this problem, most observations have been con-\nducted using the largest aperture available (LWRS, 30 \u00d7 30 arcsec).\nThis limits the spectral resolution to between 10 000 and 20 000,\ncompared to the 24 000\u201330 000 expected for the 1.25 \u00d7 20 arcsec\nHIRS aperture. However, this is not important in the analysis pre-\nsented here, as the Lyman linewidths span at least 10 A\u02da or more.\nVarious spectra analysed here were obtained through HIRS, MDRS\nor LWRS apertures and in TIMETAG or HISTOGRAM mode as indicated\nin Table 1.\nThere are several effects associated with the detectors and elec-\ntronics, including dead spots and fixed pattern efficiency variations.\nPotentially, these can lead to spurious absorption features in the\nprocessed data if they cut the dispersed spectrum at any point. One\nparticular example is the \u2018worm\u2019, which is a strip of decreased flux\nrunning along the dispersion direction that can attenuate the in-\ncident light by as much as 50 per cent. The \u2018worm\u2019 is a shadow\ncast by the electron repeller grid in the detector, located \u223c6 mm\nabove the microchannel plate surface. In the cross-dispersion di-\nrection, the spectrograph optical design places the \u2018vertical\u2019 focus\nat a similar distance above the detector surface. A strong feature\nis seen if the linear image produced by the grating coincides in\nthree-dimensional space with one of the grid wires. If the height\nof the spectral line image above the detector is close to that of the\ngrid wires, the strength of the shadow is very sensitive to the place-\nment of the star in the aperture. In such cases, the flux calibration is\nnot reliable. The shadowing effects are also wavelength-dependent\nand may be manifested as a depression in the flux, for example at\n\u223c1100\u20131140 A\u02da in the REJ2334\u2212471 spectrum of Fig. 1. In the\nspectra we have examined, the \u2018worm\u2019 seems to be mostly confined\nto wavelengths longward of the Lyman lines.\nWe have used data from both our own Guest Observer pro-\ngrammes and all those available in the public archive up to \u223c mid-\n2003 for this work. The targets are confined to hot, DA white dwarfs\nwith T eff above \u223c20 000 K. We know that the heavy element content\nof a white dwarf atmosphere can affect the perceived temperature,\ndetermined from the Balmer lines (Barstow, Hubeny & Holberg\n1998). Therefore, we have only chosen stars for which we possess\nenough information about their heavy element content from FUV\nobservations to assign an appropriate atmosphere composition. Our\nmost recent abundance measurements for these stars can be found\nin Barstow et al. (2003).\nAll the data obtained from the archive (Table 1) were reprocessed\nusing V2.0.5 of the CALFUSE pipeline. Following the bulk of the anal-\nysis reported here, two new versions of the pipeline (V2.2.1, V2.2.3)\nwere released. Therefore, we reprocessed a subset of the data with\nthese latest versions to confirm that any changes made do not affect\nour results. For example, observation 13 of the G191\u2212B2B series\nyields T eff = 57 645 K and log g = 7.60, when processed with CAL-\nFUSE V2.0.5 (see Table 3). The corresponding values for CALFUSE\nV2.2.1 are 57 702 K and 7.58, respectively, in good agreement with\nthe statistical uncertainties. We find a similarly small difference for\ndata processed with versions 2.2.1 and 2.2.3.

Because the signal-to-noise of these can be\nrelatively poor and the wavelength binning (\u223c0.006 A\u02da) oversam-\nples the true resolution by a factor of \u223c10, all the spectra were re-\nbinned to a 0.02 A\u02da pixel size for examination. Any strong interstellar\nabsorption features present are used to verify that the wavelength\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\n566 M. A. Barstow et al.\nscales for each exposure are well aligned. Individual exposures are\nthen co-added to produce a single spectrum, using our own, spe-\ncially written IDL routine, weighting the individual spectra by their\nexposure time. This whole procedure was repeated for all eight de-\ntector\/channel side combinations.\nFor the purposes of the analysis of the Lyman lines, we needed\nto combine the individual spectral segments to provide continuous\ncoverage across the line series. While this is done automatically\nduring the pipeline processing for the archive, there is no mecha-\nnism for taking into account variable exposure (from drift in and\nout of the aperture) or other effects. Therefore, it was necessary for\nus to develop our own procedure which takes due account of the\nabove problems and which can deal with the differing wavelength\nranges and spectral bin sizes of each segment. First, all the spectra\nare resampled on to a common wavelength scale of 0.02 A\u02da steps to\nreduce the level of oversampling. The resampled\/rebinned spectra\nare then co-added, weighting individual data points by the statisti-\ncal variance, averaged over a 20 A\u02da interval, to take into account any\ndifferences in the effective area of each segment and any differences\nin exposure time that may have arisen from rejection of bad data\nsegments (e.g. those with reduced exposure due to source drift).\nThrough visual inspection, it is apparent that the statistical noise\ntends to increase towards the edges of a wavelength range. In cases\nwhere the signal-to-noise ratio is particularly poor (<3:1 per reso-\nlution element) in these regions, we have trimmed the spectra (by\n\u223c2\u20133 A\u02da) to remove these data points prior to co-addition. Examples\nof the resulting spectra, taking one of the higher signal-to-noise data\nsets for each star, are shown in Fig. 1. The region of poor signal-to-\nnoise ratio seen in the 1080\u20131087 A\u02da region for all the spectra is due\nto there being no LiF data available at those wavelengths. Where we\nhad multiple exposures for any white dwarf, we carried out a fur-\nther stage of evaluation of the spectra, discarding those where the\nsignal-to-noise ratio was particularly poor or where the flux levels\nappeared to be anomalous, when compared to the remainder.\n2.2 Optical spectra\nMost of the optical data used here for the Balmer line measurements\nwere obtained as part of a spectroscopic follow-up programme, cov-\nering both Northern and Southern hemispheres, for the ROSAT X-\nray and EUV sky survey. Full details of the observations were origi-\nnally published by Marsh et al. (1997) and we have made use of these\nspectra in many subsequent publications (e.g. Barstow et al. 1998,\n2001, 2003). The main difference between the Northern and South-\nern hemisphere spectra is their resolution, \u223c8 A\u02da (FWHM) and \u223c3\nA\u02da (FWHM) respectively. Subsequently, some of the original spectra\nhave been supplemented by more recent observations, where the for-\nmer did not span the complete Balmer series due to the limited size\nof the available CCD chip, as discussed by Barstow et al. (2001). For\nsome of the stars we consider here, the \u2018new\u2019 observations cover the\nsame wavelength range as the \u2018old\u2019 but have better signal-to-noise\nratio. We analyse all these data here, as they provide a useful test of\nthe consistency between repeated ground-based observations of the\nsame star, using the same instrument configuration, in the same way\nas the multiple FUSE Lyman line observations discussed above.\n3 M O D E L AT M O S P H E R E C A L C U L AT I O N S\nA key element of our earlier paper (Barstow et al. 2001), comparing\nLyman line measurements from HUT , ORFEUS and early FUSE\ndata sets with those from the Balmer lines, is the internal consistency\nof utilizing a common grid of spectral models. We use the same\ngrids of models here, computed using the non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (NLTE) code TLUSTY (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) and its\nassociated spectral synthesis programme SYNSPEC.\nThe stars included in this study span the complete temperature\nrange of the hot H-rich DA white dwarfs and, therefore, have a range\nof compositions. The hottest stars contain significant quantities of\nheavy elements at abundance levels similar to the prototypical star\nG191\u2212B2B, while most of the cooler objects have more or less\npure-H envelopes (see, for example, Barstow et al. 2003). A few\nstars have intermediate photospheric compositions. Therefore, we\nused two appropriate separate grids of models for fitting the Lyman\nand Balmer lines. For those stars containing heavy elements, which\nare all the stars with T eff above 50 000 (except for HZ43), we fixed\nthe abundances at the values determined for G191\u2212B2B in an earlier\nanalysis using homogeneous models (He\/H = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125, C\/H =\n4.0 \u00d7 10\u22127, N\/H = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22127, O\/H = 9.6 \u00d7 10\u22127, Si\/H = 3.0\n\u00d7 10\u22127, Fe\/H = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125, Ni\/H = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22127), but taking into\naccount that the C IV lines near 1550 A\u02da have subsequently been\nresolved into multiple components by the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS; Bruhweiler et al. 2000). While not all stars\nhave exactly the same heavy element abundances, our recent work\nhas shown that the differences are not very large (Barstow et al.\n2003) and, at this level, will not have a significant effect on the\nBalmer\/Lyman line measurements (Barstow et al. 1998). For those\nstars without significant quantities of heavy elements, we used pure-\nH models for the analysis.\nBecause we are concerned with studying the H line profiles in\nthis work, the spectral synthesis code and line broadening included\ntherein are particularly important. In SYNSPEC, we have replaced the\nhydrogen Stark line broadening tables of Scho\u00a8ning & Butler (private\ncommunication) by the more extended tables of Lemke (1997). The\nlatter allow a more accurate interpolation of the electron density\nfor high-density environments, such as the atmospheres of white\ndwarfs. The spectra produced by the TLUSTY\/SYNSPEC codes were\nrecently extensively tested against the results of Koester\u2019s codes\n(Hubeny & Koester, in preparation). The differences in the pre-\ndicted spectra for T eff = 60 000 K and log g = 8 were found to\nbe below 0.5 per cent in the whole UV and optical range. Further-\nmore, we have found that the inaccuracy in the interpolations of\nthe Scho\u00a8ning and Butler tables, together with some fine details of\nour treatment of the level dissolution, were the primary reason for\nthe disagreement between the spectroscopically deduced T eff using\nTLUSTY and the Koester models obtained by Barstow et al. (1998).\nThese changes largely resolve the differences between codes noted\nby Bohlin (2000).\n4 D E T E R M I NAT I O N O F T E M P E R AT U R E\nA N D G R AV I T Y\nThe technique for determining T eff and log g, by comparing the ob-\nserved line profiles with the predictions of synthetic spectra, is well\nestablished for the Balmer lines; see Holberg, Wesemael & Basile\n(1986) and Bergeron et al. (1992) and many other subsequent au-\nthors. We have described our own Balmer line analysis technique in\nearlier papers (e.g. Barstow et al. 1994a). The Lyman line analysis\ntechnique is similar, but we have developed the exact approach dur-\ning a series of papers and, therefore, reiterate the current procedures\nhere.\nAn analysis of both series of lines was performed using the pro-\ngram XSPEC (Shafer et al. 1991), which adopts a \u03c72 minimiza-\ntion technique to determine the model spectrum giving the best\nagreement with the data. For the Balmer lines, we include H\u03b2\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\nWhite dwarf temperatures and gravities 567\nFigure 2. Model atmosphere fit (black histogram) to the Balmer line spec-\ntrum of PG1342+444 (grey error bars).\nthrough to H\u03b5 simultaneously in the fit. Applying an independent\nnormalization constant to each ensures that the result is indepen-\ndent of the local slope of the continuum, reducing the effect of any\nsystematic errors in the flux calibration of the spectrum.\nIn contrast to the ground-based Balmer line series observations,\nthe Lyman series are obtained using space-based platforms. Hence,\nthere are no systematic errors arising from an atmospheric extinc-\ntion correction. Furthermore, the flux calibration is usually obtained\nfrom a detailed off-line calibration of the instrument, applied as part\nof the standard pipeline, rather than direct comparison of the spec-\ntrum with that of a selected standard star. Because the instrument\ncalibration still refers to observations of well-studied stars, such as\nwhite dwarfs, some systematic uncertainties will still apply, but will\nbe different from and independent of those arising from ground-\nbased techniques.\nUnlike the Balmer lines, which can be isolated individually\n(Fig. 2), the Lyman series generally overlap substantially shortward\nof Lyman \u03b2. Therefore, we divided the FUSE data into two wave-\nlength ranges: from 1000 to 1050 A\u02da, incorporating the \u03b2 line, and\nfrom 930 to 990 A\u02da, covering the remaining lines (\u03b3 through \u03b5 in-\nclusive). To take account of any low-frequency systematic effects in\nthe flux calibration, we applied individual normalization constants\nto each of the two sections of data.\nApart from applying an extinction correction and flux calibration,\nanalysis of the Balmer lines is straightforward (Fig. 2), as the lines\nare, in general, uncontaminated by any other components, unless the\nstar has a binary companion and the spectrum composite. However,\nmany of the Lyman series spectra show strong emission lines, due to\nthe Earth\u2019s geocorona, superimposed on the white dwarf spectrum.\nSecondly, interstellar H I absorption can artificially deepen the core\nof the Lyman absorption lines. These two effects compete with each\nother and occasionally conspire to cancel each other out, but usually\nthey must be removed from the data in an appropriate way.\nObserved geocoronal line strengths are determined primarily by\nthe intensity of the resonantly scattered solar Lyman emission lines,\ntemporal factors and observing geometry. In general, Lyman \u03b2 is\nthe most intense with the higher-order lines showing a strong pro-\ngressive decrease. However, even if no obvious emission feature is\nseen in any Lyman absorption line, there may still be a contribution\nwhich distorts the line core from its natural shape. The geocoronal\nradiation has a natural Doppler width, which is further broadened\nin the instrument by the diffuse nature of the source and the spectral\nFigure 3.

For the LWRS, for example, the airglow lines will have a\nwidth of \u223c0.3 A\u02da and weak emission features may distort the stellar\nspectrum without being immediately obvious. As a result of differ-\nences in the relative velocity of the stellar and geocoronal sources,\nthe emission lines are not necessarily aligned with the stellar cores.\nIn this work, we ignore the central regions of each Lyman line core\nto remove the contamination from both geocoronal and interstellar\nmaterial, as illustrated by the data gaps in Fig. 3. We also remove\nall other interstellar absorption lines.\nThe white dwarf GD659, shown in Fig. 3, has an atmosphere\nlargely devoid of heavy elements. Although C, N and Si are de-\ntected by HST , at longer wavelengths than covered by FUSE, no\nfeatures (other than interstellar lines) are visible above the signal-\nto-noise of the data considered here. However, this is not true for\nall white dwarfs in the sample. In particular, a number of heavy\nelement absorption lines are visible in the spectra of the hottest,\nheavy element-rich stars, as shown very clearly in Fig. 1. In princi-\nple, the heavy element lines can be treated explicitly in the model\ncalculations and synthetic spectra. However, there are two problems\nwith this approach. The FUSE spectral range is only now becoming\nwell studied. In the context of white dwarf observations, it is not\ncertain that we have taken into account all the possible transitions\nin the models and we have little experience regarding the reliabil-\nity of the atomic data used. Furthermore, as we have seen in the\nSTIS spectra, the detailed line profiles can be strongly affected by\nthe stratification of atmospheric material (see Barstow et al. 2003),\nan effect not included in the present calculations. All the evidence\nwe have from our recent work (e.g. Barstow et al. 1998) suggests\nthat these details only have a secondary influence on the shape and\nstrength of either the Lyman or Balmer series lines. However, from\na statistical point of view, strong heavy element absorption lines\ncould have an undue influence on the overall fitting procedure, par-\nticularly if they are not accurately reproduced by the assumed value\nand depth dependence (homogeneous in this case) of the abundance.\nConsequently, we have removed all significant photospheric lines\nfrom the spectra during the analysis, as shown for REJ1738+665\n(Fig. 4). Comparing this spectrum with that of GD659 in Fig. 3, it\ncan be seen that there is an increased number of gaps in the data,\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\n568 M. A.

Strong\ninterstellar (including H2) and photospheric lines have also been removed\nfor the analysis. The best-fitting spectrum is represented by the black curve\nand the data by the grey error bars.\nfrom where the heavy element lines have been excised. We note\nthat, for REJ1738+665, we have also had to remove a number of\ninterstellar H2 lines that are present in the spectrum of this object.\nWe have analysed FUSE and ground-based data for a total of\n16 hot DA white dwarfs with temperatures ranging from 67 000 K\n(REJ1738+665) down to 22 500 K (WD1620\u2212391), determined\nfrom the Balmer lines. These results are listed in Table 3. The 1\u03c3\nerrors listed are the formal statistical uncertainties determined by\nallowing T eff and log g to vary until \u03b4\u03c7 2 reaches a value of 2.3, cor-\nresponding to the 1\u03c3 level for two degrees of freedom. It should be\nnoted that these errors do not take into account possible, significant,\ncontributions from systematic effects related to the data reduction\nand calibration processes. As we have discussed in our earlier pa-\nper on Lyman series studies (Barstow et al. 2001), such effects can\noften be a factor of 2\u20133 larger than the statistical values. Having\nrepeated observations of several stars with the same instrument af-\nfords an opportunity to examine this particular problem in detail.\nConsequently, Table 3 lists separately all the values of T eff and log\ng obtained for those stars with multiple observations.\n5 D I S C U S S I O N\n5.1 Multiple observations of individual stars\nWhite dwarfs are often used as photometric calibration sources for\nUV instruments due to their flux stability and relative ease of mod-\nelling the flux distribution. Consequently, many of the targets in-\ncluded in this work have been observed more than once, as shown\nin Table 3. Indeed, 10 of the 16 white dwarfs studied have been ob-\nserved more than once and some many times. For example, we have\n13 separate observations of G191\u2212B2B and 14 for REJ2214\u2212492.\nIt is clear, merely from inspection of Table 3 that there is some scat-\nter in values of both T eff and log g obtained for individual stars. To\nappreciate the range of this scatter in the context of the statistical\nuncertainties and the spread of values for the sample as a whole,\nall the individual Lyman line measurements are displayed in the\nT eff\/log g plane in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the scatter in data\nvalues is larger than the typical systematic errors applied to both\nT eff and log g. In general, the extent of the variation is related to\nthe number of observations in each white dwarf sample. This might\nindicate some standard distribution, such as a Gaussian, but the num-\nber of measurements is too small to prove this for any of the stars\nstudied.\nWhatever the particular reason for the spread in values of T eff\nand log g, the observed scatter is an important indication of the true\nmeasurement error. If we make the assumption that the systematic\neffects produce a normal distribution of uncertainty, then we can\ncalculate a simple mean value and assign a 1\u03c3 uncertainty from the\nvariance. The results of this exercise are summarized in Table 3, for\nboth Balmer and Lyman line analyses. This reduction of repeated\nmeasurements to a single value is most appropriate where the sample\nsize is large. At most we only have two Balmer line observations for\neach star. For the Lyman lines, we have a wider range of multiple\nvalues, from 2 to as many as 14, for REJ2214\u2212492.\nThe large number of values we have for both REJ2214\u2212492 and\nG191\u2212B2B (14 and 13 respectively) gives the best comparison\nof the total measurement error with the formal statistical value.\nFor example, the 1\u03c3 statistical errors on T eff range from 43 to\n360 K for G191\u2212B2B, compared to 831 K computed from the\nsample variance. Similarly the statistical range of 109 to 480 K\nfor REJ2214\u2212492 is smaller than the 1297 K determined from the\nsample scatter. In our previous paper on Lyman line measurements\n(Barstow et al. 2001), we suggested (as also indicated by other au-\nthors) that the statistical errors underestimated the true uncertainties\nby a factor of 2\u20133. This is so for the largest statistical errors, de-\ntermined for the spectra with the lowest signal-to-noise. However,\nwhen the signal-to-noise is increased the underestimation factor is\nmuch larger (10\u201320) for these stars.\nFigs 6 and 7 show how the statistical errors in T eff and log g de-\npend upon the signal-to-noise of each observation of REJ2214\u2212492,\nwhich we have computed from the measured average flux in the\n1050\u20131055 A\u02da range and its associated statistical error. There is\na clear relationship with smaller errors associated with increased\nsignal-to-noise and a one-to-one correspondence between the re-\nsults for T eff and log g, albeit with some scatter. However, the best\ninformation we have on the overall uncertainties comes from the\nscale of the sample variance, which is \u223c1.5 per cent of T eff for\nG191\u2212B2B and REJ2214\u2212492. The errors in log g are of a sim-\nilar magnitude. It is important to note that there is no correlation\nbetween the magnitude of the statistical errors (and by implication\nthe signal-to-noise) and the measured values of T eff or log g.\nBoth REJ2214\u2212491 and G191\u2212B2B are among the hottest\nstars in the group of DA white dwarfs we have studied. Unfor-\ntunately, no cooler DAs have been observed so intensively. How-\never, the observations of GD394 (6) and GD153 (4) suggest that\nthat the systematic measurement uncertainties decrease by no more\nthan a factor of \u223c2 toward the cooler end of the temperature\nrange.\nIt is clear from this analysis that, however much we improve the\nsignal-to-noise of the observations, effects other than the simple\nphoton counting statistics ultimately limit us. So far, we have not\nconsidered the possible sources of the measurement scatter that we\nsee and to decide on which are the most important will probably re-\nquire a controlled series of observations. Nevertheless, we can elimi-\nnate some possibilities and discuss the magnitude of others. Because\nwe are using the same instrument, pipeline processing\/calibration\nand stellar atmosphere models for the spectral analyses, we can al-\nready eliminate these factors. Hence, we need only consider the\ndifferences that can arise between specific observations. One possi-\nble variable is the level of the background, which can vary with time\nand geometrical factors associated with the location of the satellite\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\nWhite dwarf temperatures and gravities 569\nTa\nbl\ne3\n.\nVa\nlu\nes\no\nfT\nef\nf\nan\nd\nlo\ng\ng\no\nbt\nai\nne\nd\nfo\nra\nll\nFU\nV\nan\nd\ngr\nou\nnd\n-b\nas\ned\no\npt\nic\nal\no\nbs\ner\nva\ntio\nns\no\nft\nhe\n16\nw\nhi\nte\ndw\nar\nfs\nin\ncl\nud\ned\nin\nth\nis\nst\nud\ny.\nA\nll\nth\ne1\n\u03c3\ner\nro\nrs\nqu\not\ned\nfo\nre\nac\nh\nsp\nec\ntru\nm\nar\ne\nth\nes\nta\ntis\ntic\nal\nu\nn\nce\nrt\nai\nnt\nie\ns,\nw\nhi\nle\nth\ne1\n\u03c3\ner\nro\nrs\nlis\nte\nd\nfo\nrt\nhe\nsim\npl\nem\nea\nn\ns\no\nft\nhe\nm\nu\nlti\npl\neo\nbs\ner\nva\ntio\nns\nar\ne\nde\nriv\ned\nfro\nm\nth\nes\nam\npl\nev\nar\nia\nnc\nef\nor\nea\nch\nin\ndi\nv\nid\nua\nls\nta\nr.\nO\nbs\ner\nva\ntio\nn\nn\nu\nm\nbe\nrs\nfo\nr\nth\neL\nym\nan\nse\nrie\nsm\nea\nsu\nre\nm\nen\nts\nre\nfe\nrt\no\nth\nes\npe\nct\nra\nlis\nte\nd\nin\nTa\nbl\ne\n1.\nB\nal\nm\ner\nlin\ne\nm\nea\nsu\nre\nm\nen\nts\nLy\nm\nan\nlin\ne\nm\nea\nsu\nre\nm\nen\nts\nM\nea\nn\nB\nal\nm\ner\nlin\ne\nv\nal\nue\ns\nM\nea\nn\nLy\nm\nan\nlin\ne\nv\nal\nue\ns\nSt\nar\nT e\nff\n(K\n)\nEr\nro\nr\nlo\ng\ng\nEr\nro\nr\nN\no\nT e\nff\n(K\n)\nEr\nro\nr\nlo\ng\ng\nEr\nro\nr\nT e\nff\n(K\n)\nEr\nro\nr\nlo\ng\ng\nEr\nro\nr\nT e\nff\n(K\n)\nEr\nro\nr\nlo\ng\ng\nEr\nro\nr\nR\nEJ\n17\n38\n+6\n65\n66\n76\n0\n12\n30\n7.\n77\n0.\n10\n75\n79\n9\n68\n5\n7.\n85\n0\n0.\n03\n3\nPG\n13\n42\n+4\n44\n66\n75\n0\n24\n50\n7.\n93\n0.\n11\n54\n30\n8\n86\n9\n7.\n90\n1\n0.\n07\n5\nR\nEJ\n22\n14\n\u22124\n92\n61\n60\n0\n23\n00\n7.\n29\n0.\n11\n1\n70\n65\n7\n26\n5\n7.\n59\n0\n0.\n02\n5\n70\n76\n9\n12\n97\n7.\n59\n0\n0.\n06\n8\n2\n70\n88\n4\n27\n0\n7.\n53\n8\n0.\n02\n6\n3\n72\n10\n9\n24\n3\n7.\n65\n8\n0.\n02\n1\n4\n70\n58\n3\n19\n0\n7.\n73\n7\n0.\n01\n8\n5\n72\n81\n3\n20\n6\n7.\n56\n0\n0.\n01\n8\n6\n71\n94\n8\n14\n9\n7.\n53\n7\n0.\n01\n4\n7\n70\n24\n3\n15\n0\n7.\n55\n3\n0.\n01\n5\n8\n70\n92\n0\n14\n0\n7.\n57\n0\n0.\n01\n4\n9\n68\n24\n7\n17\n3\n7.\n61\n0\n0.\n01\n5\n10\n70\n99\n4\n14\n4\n7.\n56\n2\n0.\n01\n4\n11\n68\n39\n6\n16\n1\n7.\n53\n5\n0.\n01\n5\n12\n72\n03\n7\n14\n7\n7.\n53\n4\n0.\n01\n9\n13\n70\n06\n1\n48\n0\n7.\n55\n3\n0.\n04\n3\n14\n70\n87\n3\n10\n9\n7.\n72\n1\n0.\n01\n0\nR\nEJ\n05\n58\n\u22123\n73\n59\n51\n0\n22\n10\n7.\n70\n0.\n14\n65\n86\n2\n59\n8\n7.\n61\n0\n0.\n08\n5\nR\nEJ\n06\n23\n\u22123\n71\n58\n20\n0\n18\n00\n7.\n14\n0.\n11\n1\n64\n71\n1\n17\n2\n7.\n54\n6\n0.\n01\n6\n65\n75\n7\n14\n79\n7.\n54\n0\n0.\n00\n4\n2\n66\n80\n3\n21\n5\n7.\n54\n1\n0.\n02\n0\nR\nEJ\n23\n34\n-4\n71\n53\n20\n5\n13\n00\n7.\n67\n0.\n10\n1\n56\n19\n6\n41\n0\n7.\n70\n4\n0.\n03\n4\n55\n93\n3\n51\n0\n7.\n72\n0\n0.\n02\n0\n2\n55\n34\n5\n12\n8\n7.\n74\n6\n0.\n00\n7\n3\n56\n25\n8\n25\n0\n7.\n70\n5\n0.\n01\n8\nG\n19\n1\u2212\nB\n2B\n51\n51\n0\n88\n0\n7.\n53\n0.\n09\n1\n58\n70\n6\n15\n0\n7.\n65\n4\n0.\n01\n1\n53\n03\n5\n21\n56\n7.\n57\n0.\n05\n58\n15\n2\n83\n1\n7.\n64\n0\n0.\n06\n1\n54\n56\n0\n20\n0\n7.\n60\n0.\n02\n2\n56\n95\n0\n18\n5\n7.\n57\n3\n0.\n05\n0\n3\n57\n83\n4\n30\n8\n7.\n60\n8\n0.\n02\n2\n4\n58\n35\n2\n43\n7.\n71\n5\n0.\n03\n6\n5\n58\n38\n8\n53\n7.\n70\n6\n0.\n03\n6\n6\n58\n68\n7\n23\n3\n7.\n71\n2\n0.\n01\n5\n7\n59\n18\n3\n27\n8\n7.\n72\n0\n0.\n01\n8\n8\n58\n69\n0\n41\n3\n7.\n69\n1\n0.\n03\n0\n9\n58\n14\n1\n36\n0\n7.\n62\n5\n0.\n03\n0\n10\n57\n09\n8\n17\n5\n7.\n63\n3\n0.\n01\n0\n11\n56\n85\n9\n18\n1\n7.\n54\n1\n0.\n01\n5\n12\n57\n64\n5\n11\n0\n7.\n60\n0\n0.\n00\n5\n13\n59\n44\n1\n78\n7.\n58\n9\n0.\n06\n0\nG\nD\n24\n6\n51\n30\n0\n85\n0\n7.\n91\n0.\n07\n1\n52\n28\n9\n31\n8\n7.\n84\n3\n0.\n03\n0\n52\n40\n2\n86\n8\n7.\n89\n0\n0.\n09\n0\n2\n51\n39\n6\n43\n0\n8.\n00\n0\n0.\n02\n0\n4\n53\n51\n4\n24\n6\n7.\n78\n2\n0.\n02\n1\n5\n52\n41\n1\n21\n9\n7.\n87\n9\n0.\n02\n0\nR\nEJ\n04\n57\n\u22122\n81\n50\n96\n0\n10\n70\n7.\n93\n0.\n08\n1\n67\n02\n0\n20\n7\n8.\n00\n0\n0.\n00\n3\n66\n82\n1\n28\n2\n8.\n00\n0\n0.\n01\n0\n3\n66\n62\n1\n26\n5\n8.\n00\n0\n0.\n00\n2\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\n570 M.

Furthermore, Barstow et al. (2001) have already shown\nthat errors of a few per cent in subtraction of background or scat-\ntered light components can give rise to errors of the size noted\nhere.\nIn the case of FUSE observations, there is an additional effect to\nconsider, the location of the source in the aperture. While the align-\nment of one of the four spectrographs is accurately and reliably\nmaintained through the attitude control system, there is flexure in\nthe relative alignment of each of the other spectrographs due to ther-\nmal effects. While great care is taken to minimize this effect, source\ndrift within the apertures cannot be entirely eliminated and is not\ntaken into account in either the exposure time or flux calibration. In\nextreme cases, the source may drift completely out of the aperture.\nIn this event, the true exposure will be less than the expected time\nand the flux calibration will yield a clearly erroneously low value.\nHowever, if the source remains within the aperture for the complete\nduration of the observation, but is subject to vignetting, or only drifts\nout for a very short net period, the result will be less obvious. The\n\u2018worm\u2019 effect, discussed in Section 2.1 may also be sensitive to the\nprecise source alignment. A comparison of the flux levels of the\nrepeated observations of the same star (e.g. REJ2214\u2212492, Fig. 8)\nthat we have used, in which we have mostly excluded any gross\nalignment problems, shows scatter at the few tens of per cent level,\nwhich might be an indication of the behaviour discussed above. In-\ndeed, Barstow et al. (2001) have also demonstrated that such modest\nerrors in the flux calibration can give rise to the systematic errors\nin T eff and log g that we report here. However, the overall degree\nof consistency between the results from the various observations\nthat we have used is a good indication that our results are not un-\nduly sensitive to source alignment problems and the effects of the\n\u2018worm\u2019. Note that the slight trend for apparently decreasing flux\nis erroneous as the observations are not time ordered, but follow\nthe sequence of programme and observation numbers. There is one\nobservation (number 13), which has a much lower flux than the\nothers, indicating a misalignment\/overestimated exposure. This is\nan unusual occurrence, particularly as it happened while using the\nLWRS, which should be less sensitive to alignment problems. An\ninspection of the housekeeping records shows that this observation\nwas made during a period when the satellite had an unusual point-\ning problem, associated with a reaction wheel running at a speed\nthat was a harmonic of one of the telescope resonant frequencies (J.\nKruk, personal communication). This yielded a larger than normal\npointing jitter. Interestingly, this overall effect seems to have just\nproduced a simple scaling of the flux across the whole spectrum\nand does not lead to obviously anomalous values of T eff or log g.\n5.2 Comparison of Balmer and Lyman line measurements of\nT eff and log g\nFollowing the discussion of Section 5.1, we are now able to make\nrealistic estimates of the true observational errors inherent in the\nmeasurement of T eff and log g, using the Balmer and Lyman lines. To\nmake direct comparisons between each measurement technique we\nhave plotted the simple mean values, where multiple observations\nexist, of the Lyman T eff and log g against the Balmer T eff and log g\nin Figs 9 and 10, respectively. The error bars displayed are derived\nfrom the variance of the sequence of observations for each star,\nexcept where only one observation is available. Then we use just the\nstatistical error, noting the comments in Section 5.1, which indicate\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\nWhite dwarf temperatures and gravities 571\n7.4\n7.6\n7.8\n8.0\n8.2\n8.4\n8.6\n30000 35000 40000 45000 50000 55000 60000 65000 70000 75000\nTemperature (K)\nlo\ng\ng\nG191-B2B\nGD394\nHZ43\nGD246\nGD153\nGD659\nREJ0457-281\nREJ0623-371\nREJ2214-492\nREJ2334-471\nFigure 5.

Uniquely, as already reported by Barstow et al.\n(2001, 2002), PG1342+444 has a Lyman line determined temper-\nature that is significantly lower than the value measured from the\nBalmer lines. Conversely, the Lyman temperature of REJ0457\u2212281\nis significantly in excess of the Balmer line result, at a level sev-\neral times that observed in the other stars in the sample. This same\ndiscrepancy was also observed in the earlier ORFEUS observation\nFigure 10. Scatter plot of the simple mean values of log g measured us-\ning the ground-based Balmer and FUSE Lyman lines.

(2001), showing a\nconsistent result for observations made with different instruments.\nWith a clear trend observed, as described above, for all the other\nstars in the sample, it appears that these two objects are peculiar in\nsome still to be identified way. Observations of more stars in this\ntemperature range will be needed to establish just how unique these\nstars are. With a comparatively small sample, it remains possible\nthat we are seeing a couple of outliers from a distribution around\nthe general trend.\n5.2.2 Surface gravity comparisons\nThe picture is less clear-cut for the Lyman and Balmer log g mea-\nsurements (Fig. 10). In general, there is good agreement between\nthe measurements for most stars, but no particular trend is seen for\nthe four stars that have differing Lyman and Balmer log g values.\nOf these, GD394 may be peculiar. The gravity measured using the\nLyman lines is significantly larger than the Balmer result. However,\nDupuis et al. (2000) have found GD394 to be photometrically vari-\nable in the EUV and have observed an extreme abundance of Si in\nthe optical. Episodic accretion is proposed as the origin of a large\nEUV dark spot on the surface, which may also explain the anoma-\nlous Si abundance. The presence of this feature, if associated with\na different temperature to the rest of the star, may affect the line\nprofiles, compared to the homogeneous pure H atmosphere predic-\ntions. In addition, any effect will be averaged in some way over the\nobservation duration according to the phase of the 1.150-d cycle.\nThe phase coverage is unlikely to be the same for optical and FUV\nexposures. Although the discrepancy is less obvious in Fig. 9, the\nBalmer temperature is higher than the Lyman value.\nIn the case of WD1620\u2212391, the Lyman determined gravity is\nlower than that obtained from the Balmer lines. Examination of the\nspectrum in Fig. 1 reveals the presence of quasi-molecular Lyman\nsatellite lines, distorting the normal profiles (e.g. Wolff et al. 2001).\nBecause we did not include a treatment of these features in the stellar\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\nWhite dwarf temperatures and gravities 573\nmodel atmosphere calculations, it is likely that the Lyman gravity\nis incorrect.\nThe two remaining stars, REJ2214\u2212492 and REJ0623\u2212371, are\nthe two lowest gravity objects in the sample. If we exclude GD394\nand WD1620\u2212391 from consideration, they may define a trend of\ndeparture from the line of equal Lyman and Balmer gravity at low\ngravity, the former having the higher value, similar to the disagree-\nment between Lyman and Balmer line temperatures. However, if\nreal, this trend is less clear-cut than for the temperature comparison.\nIt is notable that these objects are also among the hottest in the sam-\nple with significant quantities of heavy elements and strong absorp-\ntion lines in the FUSE wavelength range. Apart from REJ1738+665,\nwhere there are a large number of interstellar H2 absorption lines,\nwe have had to remove more absorption lines from the FUSE spec-\ntra of these stars than any others. To test how much influence this\nhas on the results of the spectral analysis, we prepared a subgrid\nof synthetic spectra, with heavy element spectral lines included, for\nthese two stars. Within the statistical errors, the results are unaltered\nby the analysis with the more detailed models.\n5.3 Implications for the model atmosphere calculations\nWe have examined the scope of the possible systematic errors in\nthe analyses that have been performed and taken their magnitude\ninto account in the comparisons of Lyman and Balmer observa-\ntions shown in Figs 9 and 10 and discussed above. In this context,\nit is clear that the observed differences are significant. If our un-\nderstanding of the stars and their atmospheres was complete then\nwe should have good agreement. Hence, the discrepancies we re-\nport are an indication that the model calculations are deficient in\nsome way for the heavy element-rich hottest DAs. In terms of the\ntreatment of photospheric heavy elements, these models are highly\nadvanced, dealing with many millions of transitions. However, the\natmospheres are assumed to be homogeneous when there is contra-\ndictory evidence from the work of Holberg et al. (1999), Barstow,\nHubeny & Holberg (1999), Dreizler & Wolff (1999) and Schuh,\nDreizler & Wolff (2002). A self-consistent treatment with radiative\nlevitation included in the model atmosphere calculations needs to\nbe developed.\nAlthough the model stratification is a likely explanation of the\nproblem, there are other possibilities that should be considered in\nfuture model developments. The treatment of the hydrogen lines is\nwell advanced in the detailed inclusion of the higher level lines and\nthe line broadening theory, but most of the work in validating the\ninput physics has been based on the Balmer line analyses, with little\nopportunity to consider the Lyman lines in detail. Treatment of the\nLyman lines in the models may need further examination. However,\nthe good agreement of the Balmer and Lyman line measurements\nat temperatures below 50 000 K suggests that the line broadening\ntheory is not the problem.\nThe models computed for this analysis include most but not all\nof the heavy elements detected in the atmospheres of these stars.\nAl, P and S have been detected in the hottest stars. Although these\nelements have many fewer lines than Fe and Ni, which dominate\nthe atmospheric structure, along with the strong resonance lines of\nC, N, O and Si, their inclusion may yield subtle modifications to the\nLyman line profiles that can explain our observations.\nIn some of our earlier work, we have established that the val-\nues of T eff and log g determined from Balmer line analyses are\nsensitive to assumptions about the white dwarf photospheric com-\nposition. We have included heavy elements in the models used here\nat the known abundances. However, it is worth examining whether\nor not altering these abundances might have some influence on the\nLyman\/Balmer temperature discrepancy that we have observed. To\ndo this, we computed two further grids of models with 0.1 times\nand 10 times the nominal abundances and we carried out a test on\none FUSE observation from each of two stars, G191\u2212B2B (obs 1)\nand REJ2214\u2212492 (obs 7). We find that the heavy element content\nchanges the magnitude of the difference between Lyman and Balmer\nvalues of T eff. The difference is larger for the 0.1 times abundance\nmodels and smaller when the abundance is 10 times the nominal\nvalue. However, the changes in the temperature difference are only\n\u223c20\u201330 per cent and the discrepancy remains significant. We con-\nclude that the observed temperature discrepancy is not very sensitive\nto assumptions about the photospheric abundances. It is important\nto note that there is little scope for errors in the abundance deter-\nminations as large as the factors examined here (see Barstow et al.\n2003). However, the fact that we do see some effect may be a hint\nthat depth dependence of the heavy element abundances could be\nimportant.\nIt is important to remember that the Balmer and Lyman line mea-\nsurements give good agreement for those stars with temperatures\nbelow 50 000 K and most surface gravities. Therefore, any stars\nthat fall into this temperature range can be studied reliably using just\nthe Lyman lines when the Balmer lines are not accessible. The re-\nsults presented here also provide an empirical relationship between\nthe Lyman and Balmer line derived temperatures above 50 000 K.\nApart from exceptions such as REJ0457\u2212281 and PG1342+444,\nthe relationship appears to be single valued. Of course, until we have\ndiscovered what makes these two stars unusual, we cannot know, a\npriori, which of the hot stars we observe do follow the relation and\nwhich do not.\nAll the stars with values of T eff below 50 000 K have more or\nless pure H atmospheres and were, therefore, analysed using pure\nH models. This included GD394, which is known to have some\nheavy element content. However, the heavy element grid calcula-\ntions did not extend down to such a low temperature. It is interesting\nthat the Lyman\/Balmer temperature discrepancy is only associated\nwith stars analysed using the heavy element blanketed models. To\nascertain whether or not the temperature problem is particularly as-\nsociated with the heavy element models, we repeated the analysis\nfor selected spectra from those stars with T eff above 50 000 K with\npure H models. Although, as expected from the study of Barstow\net al. (1998), the actual values of T eff were higher than for the heavy\nelement models, the difference between the Lyman and Balmer line\nresults is of a similar magnitude.\nBecause the Balmer lines have usually been used to measure T eff\nand log g for the hot DA white dwarfs, it is tempting to assume\nthat the Balmer line analyses give the \u2018correct\u2019 values for the hottest\nwhite dwarfs. This is not necessarily the case. Whatever the un-\nderlying physical explanation of the high temperature discrepancy,\nthe effect could modify both series of absorption lines, with the\ntrue value of T eff between the values we determine. It might even\nbe the case that the Lyman lines give the more reliable temperature\ndetermination.\n6 C O N C L U S I O N\nWith the availability of the FUSE data archive and observations\nfrom our own Guest Observer programmes, we examined the use\nof the Lyman series to determine the values of T eff and log g for a\nsample of 16 hot white dwarfs. Having a source of data produced\nby a single instrument and processed with a uniform pipeline, we\nwere able to eliminate some of the possible systematic differences\nC\u00a9 2003 RAS, MNRAS 344, 562\u2013574\n574 M. A. Barstow et al.\nbetween observations of the same or different stars associated with\ndifferent instruments. However, it is clear from this study that sys-\ntematic errors in the overall observation, data reduction and analysis\nprocedures dominate the measured uncertainties. We have used the\nscatter in values derived from multiple observations of some stars\nto determine more realistic errors in the measurements than ob-\ntained just from the statistical error values. The new results partially\nreproduce our earlier study, where we studied a more limited stel-\nlar sample with data from HUT , ORFEUS and a few early FUSE\nobservations, showing that Balmer and Lyman line determined tem-\nperatures are in good agreement up to \u223c50 000 K. However, above\nthis value there is an increasing systematic difference between the\nLyman and Balmer line results, the former yielding the higher tem-\nperature. At the moment, there is no clear explanation for this effect\nbut we think that it is most likely associated with deficiencies in\nthe detailed physics incorporated into the stellar model atmosphere\ncalculations. Even so, the data do demonstrate that, for temperatures\nbelow 50 000 K, the Lyman lines give reliable results. Furthermore,\nfor the hotter stars, a useful empirical calibration of the relationship\nbetween the Lyman and Balmer measurements has been obtained,\nthat can be applied to other FUSE observations.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThe work reported in this paper was based on observations made\nwith the NASA-CNES-CSA FUSE observatory.
