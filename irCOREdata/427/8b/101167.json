Even though Thailand was running a current account deficit of \nalmost 8% of GDP and, hence, was susceptible to an exchange rate correction, other \ncountries in the region, that were subsequently affected by speculative attacks in the \nforeign exchange market were not experiencing equivalently large external imbalances at \nthe time. The region\u2019s impressive GDP growth rates in the early 1990s had earned the \ncountries the title \u2018Asian tigers\u2019. With a reputation for fiscal prudence and reasonably low \ninflation rates it seemed that little threatened their continued economic advance. \n With the liberalization of capital accounts new foreign money was channelled into \nthe south-east Asian economies mainly through the banking system. However, a \ncombination of asymmetric information and moral hazard problems led to excessive \nborrowing (e.g. Mishkin, 1999, Corsetti et al., 1998). An underestimation of the risks \nboth by bank managers and international investors meant that several firms were \nburdened with substantial amounts of foreign currency short-term debt. This constituted a \nserious problem, as most firms\u2019 earnings were in local currency, an imbalance that \nseriously exposed them to the risk of devaluation.    \n So, the source of the Asian crisis was not related to the macroeconomic \nfundamentals but rather to the inability of the private sector to allocate funds to the most \nproductive uses through an appropriate assessment of risks. In other words, the region\u2019s \n                                                 \n2 Available at http:\/\/www.imf.org\/external\/np\/exr\/facts\/asia.htm. \n 2\nproblem was structural in the sense that financial market regulation, supervision and \nmanagement were inadequate. The real effects of the crisis were painful, as growth rates \nin the region were adversely affected. Related speculative pressures in the FX markets \neventually led several governments to abolish their currency pegs (at least temporarily) \nand, as a result, the region\u2019s currencies depreciated sharply \u2013a possible reason for the \nresumption of positive growth rates relatively soon after the crisis. \n Since these events took place, a substantial amount of research has examined the \nmechanisms through which the crisis was dispersed amongst countries in the region. This \npaper covers similar ground, but uses recently devised econometric tools. It also exploits \na more complete set of data running up until 2004. This allows comparisons to be made \nbetween crisis and non-crisis periods. More specifically, the paper addresses a number of \nresearch questions. \n            First, is the relationship between currencies as measured by exchange rates \ndifferent from that between wider FX market pressure indicators? If so, this suggests that \ndifferent countries may respond to spillover effects in different ways with some allowing \nthe exchange rate to take the strain of adjustment and others opting for rising interest \nrates and\/or reserve decumulation. Second, does the relationship (the extent and nature of \nthe spillovers) differ between crisis and non-crisis periods? This is an important question \nfor the risk management of internationally diversified portfolios. If the relationship \nchanges, then what might be sensible behaviour before a crisis may not be as sensible \nduring (or after) it. Third, are contagion effects present is south-east Asian FX markets \nand, if yes, which countries are the sources and which the recipients?              \n 3\nThe paper is empirical. We do not seek to impose and test any particular model. \nHowever, the relationships we examine are informed by the relevant theory. Thus, before \nmoving on to examine the empirical evidence we attempt to place our empirical research \nin the context of existing analysis of economic and financial crises and contagion. \n \nCrisis, Interdependence and Contagion \nThe economic crises of the 1990s and early 2000s have generated interest in a \nrange of issues. The first issue is that of why crises occur. The \u2018first generation\u2019 model \n(see e.g. Krugman, 1979) accentuates fiscal and monetary mismanagement leading to \ncurrency overvaluation and reserve depletion. The \u2018second generation\u2019 model (see e.g. \nObstfeld, 1994) emphasises inconsistencies between domestic and external targets at a \nfavoured exchange rate, which induces speculators to anticipate devaluation. The \u2018third \ngeneration\u2019 model (see e.g. Corsetti et al. 1999) focuses on deficiencies in the domestic \nand foreign financial sectors that then result in a \u2018feast and famine\u2019 pattern of capital \nflows. \n The second issue relates to the nature of crisis spillovers between countries. These \nmay reflect economic interdependencies via, for example, foreign trade, but they may \nalso reflect contagion when market psychology changes. Part of the recent literature seeks \nto disentangle the extent to which country correlations capture interdependencies as \nopposed to contagion, and to examine the extent to which crises lead to closer \ncorrelations than would be expected on the basis of economic interdependencies.3\n                                                 \n3 Forbes and Rigobon (2002) highlight the role of heteroscedasticity in testing for contagion, where the \nlatter is defined as a significant change in the real transmission mechanism in crisis states. Empirical studies \nof contagion adopting various definitions include, among others, Eichengreen et al. (1996), Glick and Rose \n(1999), Caramazza et al. (2000), Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000) and Van Rijckeghem and Weder (2001).  \n 4\n  Both of the above issues have received a great deal of attention in the literature. A \nrelated topic of interest, which we address in this paper, is that of the nature of cross-\ncountry correlations involving measures of pressure in the FX market. Imagine that there \nis a financial crisis in one country which leads to a deterioration in overall market \npsychology and to increasing market pessimism. Capital markets may then seek to \nwithdraw funds from other countries whose foreign exchange markets will as a result be \nput under pressure (this is the \u2018common lender effect\u2019, where investors holding \ninternational portfolios and seeking liquidity will sell assets in a market following an \nasset price fall in another). The crisis in the first country triggers a FX crisis elsewhere. \nOf course, some countries may be more vulnerable to crisis than others; the second \ngeneration model emphasises the interplay between time-inconsistent policy objectives \nand vulnerability. But there may also be differences in response. Some affected countries \nmay be more inclined to allow the value of their currencies to fall, others may opt for \nmore rapid decumulation of reserves and still others may be more inclined to raise \ninterest rates. Finally, some countries may attempt to insulate themselves from the crisis \nby imposing capital controls. The choice will ultimately be affected by views about the \neffectiveness of alternative responses and the political economy of the distribution of \ngains and losses associated with them. Given that such views may vary across countries it \nseems probable that FX pressure will be exhibited in different forms in different \ncountries. \n Our paper in part explores this issue. There are two ways in which we could \napproach it. An ambitious approach would be to establish theoretical priors on the basis \n 5\nof a formal analysis of the views and preferences discussed above. A second, less \nambitious but much more manageable approach, and the one we adopt here, is to examine \nthe nature and structure of FX market correlations. By examining the revealed \npreferences of countries\u2019 authorities we can perhaps infer something about their \nperceptions of the effectiveness of the various instruments as well as the political \neconomy of gains and losses. \n A further issue in the context of crises relates to their spatial distribution. At one \nlevel there is the question of whether crises are regionally contained. But beyond this \nthere are the questions of whether, at a more disaggregated level, regional \u2018neighbours\u2019 \nare differently affected and why they may be differently affected. The concept of \n\u2018regionalisation\u2019 suggests that there will be little regional differentiation, since regional \nproximity is sometimes assumed to be the driving force behind contagion. However, this \nmay be unduly simplistic. Instead, it is perhaps more realistic to posit that, even within \nregions, there will be variations in crisis vulnerability. For this reason capital markets \nmay not regard all \u2018regional\u2019 assets as equally close substitutes for one another. \n The above discussion leads to a more subtle issue. Where spillovers incorporate \nboth interdependence and contagion, it may in principle be that the pattern of correlations \nchanges depending on whether or not there is a crisis. Thus, for example, two countries \nwhere there are relatively limited economic interdependencies may reveal relatively low \nFX spillovers in non-crisis conditions. In crisis conditions, however, other factors may \ncome into play, such that the vulnerability to crisis and the degree of substitutability \nbetween financial assets. This may then mean that crisis correlations are significantly and \nrelatively higher in a crisis. If this were to be the case, it would have implications for \n 6\ncreditors\u2019 portfolio management. Portfolio managers can clearly seek to reduce portfolio \nrisk by means of diversification. But diversification will not help if there is a close \npositive correlation between the different assets in the portfolio. If, however, the pattern \nof correlation changes as between crisis and non-crisis periods, the composition of the \nrisk-minimising portfolio will also change. A portfolio that minimises risk in non-crisis \nconditions may fail to insulate returns in a crisis where minimising risks may be even \nmore important. \n In summary, while this paper is essentially empirical, it is motivated by the \nexisting theory and literature on crisis and contagion. In what follows, we seek to \ndetermine the extent and nature of spillovers during crisis and non-crisis periods in the \noccasionally turbulent FX markets of south-east Asia.  \n \nData and Variables \n Monthly nominal bilateral exchange rates with the US dollar for Indonesia, Korea, \nMalaysia, the Philippines and Thailand are taken from International Financial Statistics \npublished by the IMF. Figure 1 captures the recent history of exchange rate movements in \nthe south-east Asian FX markets. The five countries in our sample had implemented a \nvariety of exchange rate regimes over the sample period, but immediately before July \n1997 they were all de facto fixing their currencies to the US dollar. When speculative \npressures in the region arose, interest rates escalated and international reserves fell in an \neffort to defend the values of the local currencies. Eventually, the countries abolished \ntheir quasi-fixed exchange rate regimes and floated their currencies.4  \n                                                 \n4 According to Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) prior to the 1997 events all countries in the sample were \nrunning de facto pegs against the US dollar (except Malaysia, which was operating a de facto moving band \n 7\n We use nominal exchange rates, interest rates and international reserves in the \nconstruction of a foreign exchange (FX) market pressure indicator (fxmpi). Our analysis \nis based on two \u2018crisis\u2019 measures: the percent change in the values of the nominal \nexchange rate (dlxr) and fxmpi.5 Increases in the value of fxmpi signify more pressure \n(hence the negative sign for the reserves component of the indicator): \n[ ] 100**** tttt dlresdirdlxrfxmpi \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 \u2212+= , \nwhere dir is the change in the domestic interest rate and dlres is the change in the natural \nlogarithm of international reserves minus gold (in dollars). The weights of the variables \nare determined as follows: \ndlresdirdlxr\ndlxr\nSDSDSD\nSD\n111\n1\n++\n=\u03b1 , \ndlresdirdlxr\ndir\nSDSDSD\nSD\n111\n1\n++\n=\u03b2 , and \ndlresdirdlxr\ndlres\nSDSDSD\nSD\n111\n1\n++\n=\u03b3 , \nwhere SD stands for standard deviation. The need to use both measures arises from the \nfact that it is possible that nominal exchange rate movements do not reveal the extent of \nspeculative pressures. These may be reflected by the use of other policy instruments (e.g. \n                                                                                                                                                 \naround the US dollar). Post-crisis all currencies were freely floating (or falling). Eventually some reverted \nto managed floats (Philippines, Thailand) or established new pegs (Malaysia). \n5The variable fxmpi has its roots in Girton and Roper (1977). The use of similar indices to capture pressures \nin the FX market is not unusual (e.g. Eichengreen et al., 1996), even though there have also been criticisms \n(see Eika et al., 1996 and Willett and Nitithanprapas, 2000). \n 8\nreserves, interest rates and capital controls). Hence, we can use fxmpi to assess the \npresence of speculative pressures and dlxr to determine how successful these have been.6  \n Table 1 provides descriptive statistics and correlations for the two crisis measures. \nEven though percent changes in exchange rates are highly correlated between countries in \nthe sample, the same cannot be said about the wider pressure indicator.  Figures 2a and \n2b plot the series over time. The increased volatility in mid 1997 is evident in both. But \nwhereas the volatility of fxmpi subdued post-1997 (with the exception of Indonesia), the \nvolatility of dlxr increased (with the exception of Malaysia that quickly resorted to a \nfixed exchange rate regime). This is natural, since following the adoption of flexible \nexchange rates after the crisis pressures in the FX market were reflected in changes in the \nexchange rate, hence reducing the need for use of interest rates and\/or reserves as policy \ninstruments.   \n \nTranquil and Crisis Regimes \n To model the time series we adopt a commonly used strategy for the analysis of \nstructural change: a Markov regime switching model (see e.g. Hamilton, 1989). This \napproach is appropriate, as the model assumes autoregressive processes in which the \nparameters depend on the realizations of an unobserved regime variable, which in turn is \nmodelled as a Markov chain. The latter assumes that realizations of the state only depend \non their (chronologically) previous realization. The regime variable is discrete and can \nonly take two values: 0 if there is no crisis and the distribution has a low mean and 1 if \nthere is a \u2018crisis\u2019 and the distribution has a high mean. In contrast to Hamilton (1989) we \nassume a heteroscedastic setting in which the variance changes across the two regimes. \n                                                 \n6 We do not incorporate a measure of capital controls in our estimations because of the unreliability of data. \n 9\n The model can be written as \n( ) ttttt yysy \u03b5\u03b2\u03b2\u00b5 \u03c1\u03c1 +++=\u2212 \u2212\u2212 ...11 , \nwhere \u03c1  denotes the order of the autoregression and \u00b5  is the regime-dependent mean \nconditional on the state variable, . The ts \u03b2 s are autoregressive coefficients to be \nestimated and \u03b5  is a normally distributed error term with zero mean and regime-\ndependent variance. In this setting, we can estimate the matrix of transition probabilities, \nwhich contains the probabilities of remaining in one regime and of switching to another. \nIn the case with two regimes we have four such probabilities: , ,  and , \nwhere, for example,  gives the probability of remaining in regime 1 and  gives the \nprobability of switching from regime 1 to regime 2.\n11p 12p 21p 22p\n11p 12p\n7  \nTable 2a gives the results of the estimations of a heteroscedastic Markov \nswitching (intercept) model with two regimes and three autoregressive terms for fxmpi, \nwhich is denoted as MSIH(2)-AR(3) using Krolzig\u2019s (1997) notation.8 It can be seen that \nfor Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines regime 2 is identified as one with \nhigher FX pressures (as captured by the higher mean). In contrast, for Thailand regime 2 \nis the low pressure regime. In all cases, regime 2 is more volatile (as captured by the \nhigher standard errors). Both regimes are quite persistent, although regime 2 less so than \n1, indicating that the probability of switching from a non-crisis to a crisis regime is lower \nthan the probability of switching from a crisis regime to a non-crisis regime. Results for \ndlxr (Table 2b) are quite similar, although regimes are now less persistent. In addition, \n                                                 \n7 The model of Hamilton assumes that the transition probabilities are constant. This has the implication that \nexogenous variables cannot affect the probability of switching from one regime to another. Diebold (1994) \nand Filardo (1994) extend the model to time-varying transition probabilities.  \n8 Setting a different lag length than the reported of three months does not affect the results substantially. \n 10\nand consistent with the rest of the sample, regime 2 for Thailand is now a crisis regime. \nMalaysia\u2019s distributions of observations across the two regimes are the same.  \nVisual inspection of the crisis regime probabilities using both measures (not \nreported) shows that for most countries the period from mid 1997 to early 1998 was \ncharacterized by speculative pressures and falls into the category of a crisis regime. The \napparent \u2018synchronicity\u2019 of the incidence of crises may reflect regional inter-dependence \narising from trade links, a common unobserved shock, or contagion. \n In this paper, we do not try to determine the exact classification of the spillovers \nalthough we do test several related hypotheses. First, we examine the contemporaneous \ncorrelations between the pressure indicators across regimes. This has important \nimplications for portfolio management. The possibility that the correlations may change \nsign and\/or magnitude in different states of the world could affect the risk characteristics \nof a portfolio with holdings in the different markets. In order to carry out this exercise we \nneed to extend the methodology to a Markov switching vector autoregression (see Kolzig, \n1997). Examining the FX market in the context of a system of interrelated economies has \nthe advantage that we are allowing the market in question to be affected by recent \nmovements in other markets as well as by recent movements in the market itself. Hence, \nwe can calculate and compare the (regime-dependent) correlations.  \n Second, we construct the multivariate version of the Forbes and Rigobon (2002) \ncontagion test, as proposed by Dungey et al. (2005). This allows us to examine the effects \nof each country\u2019s FX market on the rest of the countries in the sample, while controlling \nfor the effect of heteroscedasticity. Even though there is no agreed definition of contagion \n 11\nin the literature (see pp. 96-98 in Chui and Gai, 2006 for a taxonomy of definitions) we \nwill interpret as contagion an increase in conditional correlations in the crisis regime. 9\n  \nRegime-dependent Correlations \n Turning to the VAR version of the fixed transition probability model, the system \ncan now be written as \n( ) tjt\nj\njtt yBsy \u03b5\u00b5\n\u03c1\n+=\u2212 \u2212\n=\n\u2211\n1\n, \nwhere y is a vector of dependent variables and B denotes a matrix of estimated \nparameters. Matrices B are square matrices with the number of columns and rows equal \nto the number of series in the autoregression. There are as many Bs as the order of the \nautoregression. \nEstimation of this model assuming two regimes and an autoregressive order \u03c1 =1 \n(consistent with the Schwarz criterion) gives the results reported in table 3. It is evident \nthat, for both measures, regime 1 is classified as a tranquil regime with a low mean and \nvariance, whereas regime 2 is classified as a crisis regime with a high mean (indicating \ndevaluations\/pressures in FX) and increased volatility. The tranquil regime continues to \nbe highly persistent implying that switching to a crisis regime is associated with a \nrelatively low probability. Switching back from a crisis regime to a tranquil one is, on the \nother hand, associated with a higher probability, even though crisis regimes are also fairly \npersistent.  \n                                                 \n9 Our approach does not include fundamentals given the monthly frequency of our data and the absence of \nagreement in the literature on what would constitute a universally accepted set of fundamentals.  \n 12\n Figure 3 plots the (smoothed) probabilities of being in crisis across the two \nmeasures. Following the turbulence of the second half of 1997 the FX pressures, as \ncaptured by fxmpi, subsided. Exchange rate depreciation continued for several years after \n1997 without being accompanied by higher interest rates or a loss of reserves. \n Table 4 shows the estimated correlations for the five countries across the two \nregimes. It can be seen that, for both measures, the magnitude of the correlations change \nfrom one regime to the other. In some instances, the sign of fxmpi correlations changes as \nwell. For example, Thailand\u2019s correlations with the rest of the countries in the sample \nchange sign across the two regimes. However, an investor with no sophisticated \ninformation about the prevailing state of the world at each observation would potentially \nbase his\/her fund allocation strategy on non-regime dependent (constant) correlations like \nthose reported in Tables 1c and 1d. Even though the differences between the constant \ncorrelations and the crisis ones are less pronounced, it is still possible for the constant \ncorrelations to convey misleading information. For example, Thailand\u2019s fxmpi correlation \nwith Korea is -2.6% increasing to 3.5% during crises. The implication is that an investor \nwith assets in Thailand and Korea, who may have allocated funds based on the small \nnegative correlation between the two countries, will find that the benefits from such \ndiversification are slightly reduced during times of crisis, as the devaluation probability \nand associated default risks increase simultaneously in both countries in times of FX \nturbulence. However, some of the correlations move in the opposite direction, i.e. from a \npositive correlation to a negative one during a crisis period. Even so, in most cases the \ndifferences in magnitude are not dramatic, a fact that limits the usefulness of the extra \n 13\ninformation contained in regime-dependent correlations. The same conclusion can be \nreached from an analysis of exchange rate correlations.     \n \nContagion \n          We now turn to the issue of contagion. Forbes and Rigobon (2002) have shown that \nan increase in correlations in a crisis state does not necessarily represent contagion. Even \nwithout a change in the real transmission mechanism the increased volatility in one \nmarket will result in higher correlation with another market in a crisis state. Forbes and \nRigobon (2002) construct a correlation coefficient that controls for the effects of \nheteroscedasticity. Dungey et al. (2005) have extended the test in a multivariate setting. \nFor country 1, e.g., we have  \n( ) tt\nnc\nt\n,111\n1,\n,1 '' \u03bd\u03b4\u03c7\u03c6\u03c3\n\u03c9 +\u2297\u039b+\u039b= , \nwhere t,1\u03c9  contains the stacked values of fxmpi or dlxr for country 1 (the observations \nthat correspond to the tranquil periods stacked on top of the observations that correspond \nto the crisis periods), nc\u03c3  denotes the (non time-varying) standard deviation of the non-\ncrisis observations, \u03c6  and  \u03c7  are vectors of estimated coefficients, \u039b is a matrix \ncontaining scaled, stacked observations of fxmpi or dlxr for the rest of the countries, i.e. \n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n1,\n,1\n2,\n,2 ...\nnnc\ntn\nnc\nt\n\u03c3\n\u03c9\n\u03c3\n\u03c9\n, and  t\u03b4  is a stacked dummy variable taking the value 0 if the system is \nin a tranquil state and 1 if it is in a crisis state. Similar equations are constructed for the \nrest of the countries. \n 14\n The classification of observations as crisis or non-crisis is based on the estimation \nof a MSIH(2)-VAR(1) model. The system of equations is estimated with the seemingly \nunrelated regression (SUR) method. The estimates contained in \u03c7  capture contagion \neffects (if any) so that we can examine the direction and magnitude of spillovers arising \nfrom a particular country during a crisis. Table 5 presents results for fxmpi and dlxr. \nFocusing on the FX market pressure indicator it turns out that Korea, Malaysia and the \nPhilippines seem to \u2018export\u2019 their FX pressures to Indonesia and Thailand, both of which \nappear to be victims of contagion during the sample period. Thailand on the other hand, \nwhich was the first country to devalue in 1997, only seems to affect Korea. Focusing on \nexchange rate changes, there is no clear direction of contagion effects. Indonesia affects \nand is affected by Thailand. It also affects the Philippines, which in turn affects Thailand \nand Korea. Korea affects Malaysia.  \n These results seem to affirm that no one country in particular is responsible for \ninfecting the others. Over the period of the sample (1990-2004) several of the featured \ncountries seem to have exported their shocks regionally at some stage affecting \nneighbouring countries to a varying extent. Identifying these shocks requires an extensive \ncase-by-case study and is the next step of this research. In addition, the results between \nfxmpi and dlxr are strikingly different, a fact that highlights the different types of \ninformation that the two measures convey: fxmpi is a wider measure and can indicate a \ncrisis even in the absence of an actual devaluation, whereas dlxr only indicates a crisis \nwhen there is a substantial loss in the value of the currency (in terms of $US) but can \nmiss speculative pressures where the use of reserves and the interest rate has been \nsuccessful.  \n 15\nConcluding Remarks  \n In this paper, we have used recent advances in econometric techniques to answer \nquestions about the interrelationships between south-east Asian foreign exchange markets \nduring the period 1990-2004 with a view to gaining a better understanding of a number of \nissues to which the recent literature directs us. South-east Asia is particularly interesting \ngiven the opportunity to examine countries that are frequently and somewhat loosely \nclassified together, as well as the transition sequence from periods that may be \ncharacterised as non-crisis to crisis and back to non-crisis. \n       As we anticipate from our consideration of the relevant theory, we find that the \npattern of spillovers varies across countries in the region in terms of their effects on \nexchange rates, interest rates and reserve levels. This implies that monetary authorities \nrespond in different ways to FX market pressures. Some are less prepared to see currency \ndepreciation than others, even in the context of crises. However, in this paper we do not \nexplore in detail what accounts for these differences although we do briefly discuss \npossible explanations. \nWe also find that there are significant differences in the strength of spillovers \nsuggesting that contagion is not simply a matter of regionalisation. This finding could, \nhowever, be consistent with a number of potential explanations involving different \ndegrees of interdependence, capital market imperfections, and vulnerability to crisis. \nFurther research would be needed to tease out the relative importance of these factors in \nexplaining the different spillover patterns observed in the region. In this paper we do \ndiscover that the pattern of correlation between countries sometimes varies across crisis \nand non-crisis periods, even though not dramatically. Importantly, some types of \n 16\ndiversification that may be risk-reducing during a non-crisis period may not be risk-\nreducing during a crisis. This finding also suggests that reserve pooling arrangements that \ndepend on negative correlations amongst participants may be ill-informed if non-crisis \nperiods are used to identify correlations that are, in practice, contingent on whether crises \nexist.  \nIn short the findings reported here counsel against simplistic analyses of \ncontagion. Even at the regional level the nature of spillovers is quite complex and the \nresponses to them are diverse. We are therefore able to reject stories that emphasise \nuniformity. However, at this stage we are only offering potential explanations of the \ndiversity we observe. The next stage in research is to seek a richer and evidence-based \nexplanation of these differences. \n 17\nREFERENCES \nCaramazza, F., Ricci, L. and Salgado, R.
