WALKER\nDepartment of Physics, University of Surrey,\nGuildford GU2 7XH, UK\np.walker@surrey.ac.uk\nReceived (received date)\nRevised (revised date)\nAs a subset of radioactive beams, isomer beams open up the dimensions of excitation\nenergy and angular momentum. The problem of isomer decay rates is briefly presented,\nas they are not yet well understood. The use of isomer beams for nuclear structure\ninvestigations is reviewed, using examples related to exotic decay modes, charge radii,\nand Coulomb excitation. There are also unique possibilities for the study of induced\nelectromagnetic depopulation. A key aspect is beam purification, for which different\ntechniques are discussed.\n1. Introduction\nIsomers are metastable excited states of atomic nuclei.1,2 They can decay by the\nsame mechanisms as unstable ground states, as illustrated in Figure 1. In addi-\ntion, isomers (but not ground states) can decay electromagnetically, by \u03b3-ray or\nconversion-electron emission.\nThere is no strict lower half-life limit required for an excited nuclear state to\nbe called an isomer. It is rather a practical matter of being able to use the lifetime\nto distinguish isomer radiations from the majority of \u201cprompt\u201d radiations that\nare emitted following nuclear reactions. The present work is concerned with iso-\nmer beams from electromagnetic separation devices, which typically require about\n500 ns for in-flight separation, and about 50 ms for isotope separation on-line (ISOL)\ntechniques. A perspective on the range of isomers3 with an excitation energy of at\nleast 1 MeV and a half-life exceeding 50 ms, is given in Figure 2. Any of these, as\nwell as others at lower excitation energies, can be considered as potential isomer\nbeams by in-flight or ISOL techniques. A different perspective is given in Figure 3,\nwhere the requirement is for I > 10 ~ and T1\/2 > 50 ms.\n2. Added dimensions\nIt is evident that isomers give access to the added dimensions of excitation energy\nand angular momentum, as compared to nuclear ground states. There are essentially\nthree classes of isomer: shape traps, yrast traps, and K traps. It is problematic to\n1\nAugust 10, 2006 11:33 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE walker\n2 P.M.

K traps depend on the orientation of the\nangular momentum vector, and they occur only in deformed nuclei with an axis of\nsymmetry. They account for most of the examples in Figure 2 that are away from\nshell closures.\nIt is expected that additional isomers will be discovered in nuclei far from\n\u03b2 stability, and various models can be used to make predictions. For example,\nthe neutron-rich nuclide 188Hf is predicted5,4,6 to be very favourable for long-lived,\nhigh-spin isomers. Indeed, some of the isomers in the 188Hf region are most likely\nto \u03b2 decay, rather than \u03b3 decay, and there may be an A \u2248 188 island of \u03b2-decaying\nhigh-spin isomers, only reaching nuclear ground states close to \u03b2 stability. The\nA = 188 decay chain is schematically illustrated in Figure 4. One potential com-\nplication is that 188Hf (N = 116) is itself close to the neutron number (N = 118)\nwhere a prolate-oblate shape change is expected.7 Nevertheless, energy-surface cal-\nculations predict well defined prolate, axially symmetric shapes for the ground,\n10\u2212, and 18+ states of 188Hf, with \u03b22 = 0.175, 0.177 and 0.185 respectively,\n6 as\nillustrated in Figure 5, so that K isomerism is most likely.\nBeams of isomers can be used and studied in a variety of inter-related ways: (i)\nThey give access to the structure of exotic nuclei and exotic decay modes at the lim-\nits of experimental accessibility. In this category, proton and neutron decays will be\nconsidered. (ii) Isomers live long enough to enable static electromagnetic properties\nto be measured. Here, the charge radii of multi-quasiparticle isomers will be dis-\ncussed.

An important consideration is\nalways the ability to bring sufficient angular momentum into the initial reaction,\nwhich is a critical factor for isomer production by projectile fragmentation.8,9 First,\nhowever, consideration is given to isomer decay rates, since these determine their\nvery existence.\n3. Isomer decay rates\nThe half-lives of isomers depend on many factors, and so far it is not possible to\nmake reliable predictions, except in special cases. The series of N = 80, Ipi = 10+\nseniority isomers in spherical nuclei, for example, show10 the effect of the structure\nof the state to which the isomer decays.\nIn deformed nuclei, K isomers arise when the decay can only take place by\n\u201cK-forbidden\u201d transitions with \u2206K > \u03bb, where \u03bb is the transition multipolarity.\nThe implied K mixing can be rotational (Coriolis), vibrational (\u03b3 tunnelling), or\nstatistical, as discussed in ref.4 The statistical, or level-density, effect is illustrated\nin Figure 6, which has been updated from ref.4, including recent data11,12,13,14 for\n183,184Os, 174Yb, and 174W, respectively. The curve through the data is based on\nlevel-density considerations.15 In the graph, the reduced hindrance is defined as\nf\u03bd = F\n1\/\u03bd\nW , where FW is the Weisskopf hindrance factor, and \u03bd = \u2206K \u2212 \u03bb is the\ndegree of forbiddenness.\nThe data points that fall below the level-density estimate can be explained,\nat least in part, by Coriolis K mixing, and especially through the influence of so-\ncalled t bands16 (the high-K equivalent of s bands). This aspect is illustrated by\nthe two values16 given for 179W: the filled square assumes that the state to which\nAugust 10, 2006 11:33 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE walker\nISOMER BEAMS 5\n0.20      0.25                   0.20     0.25\n0.10\n0.20\nK\n\u0000\n= 0+ K\n\u0000\n= 18+\nFig. 5.

The importance of accounting for t-configuration mixing\nis evident, but often this cannot be done quantitatively, and its effect has not been\nincluded in evaluating the other data in Figure 6.\nThe recent data point14 for the 174W, Kpi = 12+ isomer is of special interest\nbecause it goes against the \u03b3-tunnelling prediction. The 6+ isomer decay in 174Yb\n(not illustrated) is also a problem13 for the \u03b3-tunnelling description. A model is\ncertainly needed that includes both \u03b3-tunnelling and Coriolis mixing in a consistent\nframework.\n4. Proton and neutron decays\nThe first example of proton radioactivity was found17 from a 19\/2\u2212, 3-quasiparticle\nisomer in 53Co, with 1.56 MeV proton emission leading directly to the 0+ ground\nstate of 52Fe. This kind of nucleon emission from a multi-particle configuration\nis hard to describe theoretically18,19 but leads to the expectation that neutron\nemission will be a possible mode of radioactive decay on the neutron-rich side of\n\u03b2 stability. Although the Coulomb barrier would be absent, a substantial centrifu-\ngal barrier remains for high-spin-isomer decay. A schematic illustration is given in\nFigure 7.

The curve\nrepresents a spin-dependent level-density estimate.\nisomer,20 for example. While it would be difficult to observe the associated mono-\nenergetic neutrons, alternative detection methods can be envisaged, such as through\nthe capture of the isomeric nucleus in a storage ring, and the observation of the\nproduct nucleus when the isomer decays. Such single-ion decay observations have\nbeen clearly identified for other decay modes21 in the ESR at GSI.\nMulti-quasiparticle proton-emitting isomers have also been found9,22 in 54Ni and\n94Ag. Furthermore, 2-proton emission has been identified from the 94Ag isomer.23\nIt seems that the continuing exploration of isomers close to the drip lines will\nmost likely reveal further examples of exotic decay modes, with important physics\nimplications.\n5. Charge radii\nA very productive use of low-energy ion and atom beams has been for the inves-\ntigation of nuclear charge radii and electromagnetic moments, by collinear laser\nspectroscopy.24 The method is well suited to isomers with T1\/2 > 50 ms, and re-\nfractory elements such as hafnium25 can be studied with ion-guide techniques. It\nis particularly intriguing that isomer charge radii are found26,27 to be smaller than\ntheir corresponding ground-state radii.

Coulomb excitation\nWith the on-going development of radioactive-beam facilities, which generate in-\ntense beams of unstable nuclides at energies close to and above the Coulomb bar-\nrier, there is the possibility to investigate nuclear reactions with isomer beams. The\nCoulomb excitation of isomeric states is one of the most straightforward isomer\ninteractions to study, and some results are already available.\nPioneering work, with inverse fusion-evaporation reactions to generate the iso-\nmer beam, was carried out at the HSIB facility at RIKEN, where secondary\nCoulomb excitation of the 2.4 \u00b5s, 8\u2212 isomer in 174Hf was successfully observed.28\nMore recently29 secondary Coulomb excitation of the 4 m, 6\u2212 isomer in 68Cu\nhas been studied at CERN-ISOLDE following proton spallation reactions. Here,\nattention is drawn to two remarkable features of this study. First, laser resonance\nionisation was used to generate an almost pure, accelerated isomer beam \u2212 a land-\nmark achievement. Second, the observed Coulomb excitation is associated with\nisomer depopulation, i.e. at least some of the decay of the Coulomb-excited states\nbypasses the isomer and proceeds promptly to the ground state. This is of general\ninterest2,30 with regard to the quest to control, and indeed enhance, isomer decay\nrates by electromagnetic processes (which have no influence on ground-state de-\ncay rates). Purified isomer beams present a new and unique opportunity to study\ninduced electromagnetic depopulation.\nAugust 10, 2006 11:33 WSPC\/INSTRUCTION FILE walker\n8 P.M. Walker\n7. Isomer beam purification\nAs illustrated above, isomer beams present a range of openings for nuclear structure\ninvestigations, from keV energies upwards, and high-energy isomer beams offer novel\noptions specifically for secondary nuclear reactions. However, beam purification is\na key issue. In general, mass separators have insufficient resolution to distinguish\nisomers from ground states.\nSo far, there appear to be three distinct ways to achieve isomer-beam purifica-\ntion. The simplest, conceptually, is to choose an isomer which is longer lived than\nits respective ground state, and to wait for the ground state to decay. This is a very\nrestrictive condition, but may be used with, for example, the 45 s, 18+ isomer of\n212Po, where the ground-state half-life is just 300 ns.\nSecondly, the method of laser resonance ionisation can be highly selective, as\ndiscussed above; and thirdly, storage rings21,31 offer sufficient resolution, at least in\nprinciple, to physically remove a ground state and leave its isomer.\nIn addition, for \u00b5s isomers produced initially in-flight by fusion-evaporation or\nprojectile-fragmentation reactions, it is possibile28 to use time correlations with\nthe isomer decay radiations to select events associated with secondary Coulomb or\ninelastic excitations. More complex possibilities of this type, i.e. exploiting time-\ncorrelated decays, include secondary transfer reactions to \u00b5s isomers.\n8. Outlook\nThe opportunities with isomer beams are many and varied, and only the first steps\nhave so far been taken to exploit them. The future utility of such beams depends\non the combination of appropriate beam energy, beam intensity, beam purity, and\nother aspects of beam quality \u2212 spatial, energy and time resolutions. While some\nof these requirements are integrated into on-going radioactive-beam developments,\nother isomer-specific features will need separate attention; and there are many open\nquestions, such as whether it will be possible to identify neutron radioactivity from\nisomers in neutron-rich nuclides.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Re-\nsearch Council.
