INTRODUCTION \nSigma Delta modulation achieves A\/D and D\/A conversion by using some very \nsimple and low cost components [1]. Hence, SDMs are common in many industrial and \nengineering applications. Research and development of SDMs has been concerned with \nthe use of multi-bit quantizers because SDMs with single bit quantizers are highly \nunstable and typically overloaded [2]. \nIt is well known that elliptical fractal patterns may occur in bandpass SDMs with \nsingle bit quantizers [3]. The question arises whether similar patterns will occur for the \nmulti-bit case. If the saturation regions of the quantizers are not activated and there are \nan infinite number of bits for the implementation of the quantizers, then the bandpass \nSDMs become linear systems and fractal behavior would not occur. Consequently, one \nmay ask if the number of bits of the quantizers is increased, but the saturation regions of \nthe quantizers are still not activated, would the nonlinear behavior disappear? If not, \nwhat behaviors would be shown on the phase portraits as the number of bits of the \nquantizers is increased? \nThe organization of the letter is as follows. The system is described in Section II. \nSome results are shown in Section III. The conclusion is summarized in Section IV. \n \nII. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION \nConsider the bandpass SDM discussed in [3]. It can be described by the following \nstate space equation: \n 3\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )kkkk CuBsAxx +\u2212=+1  for 0\u2265k , (1) \nwhere ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]Tkxkxk 21\u2261x  is the state vector function of the system, \n( ) ( ) ( )[ ]Tkukuk 12 \u2212\u2212\u2261u  is a vector containing the past two consecutive points from \nthe input signal ( )ku , \n\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2261 \u03b8cos21\n10\nA , and \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u2212\u2261\u2261 \u03b8cos21\n00\nCB  (2) \nin which the superscript T  denotes the transpose operator and ( ) { }0\\,\u03c0\u03c0\u03b8 \u2212\u2208 . When \n{ }\u03c0\u03c0\u03b8 ,0,\u2212\u2208 , the system is either a lowpass or highpass SDM, which is out of the \nscope of this letter. We consider the case when ( )kx  and ( )ku  are real signals and ( )ku  \nis a constant input, that is ( ) uu =k  for 0\u2265k . \nFor the N-bit bandpass SDMs, \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )[ ]TkxQkxQk 21\u2261s  for 0\u2265k , (3) \nwhere Q  is a uniform midrise quantizer and represented as \n( )\n\u23aa\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u23a9\n\u23aa\u23aa\n\u23aa\n\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2260\u2264\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b\n\u0394\n\u0394\n=\n>\n\u2261\n0 and \n00\nyLy\ny\nceil\ny\ny\ny\nLy\ny\ny\nyQ , (4) \nin which \u0394  is the step size of the quantizers and defined as  \n12\n1\n\u2212\u2261\u0394 N , (5) \n( )12 1 \u2212\u0394\u2261 \u2212NL , (6) \ny  denotes the absolute value of y  and ( )yceil  is the nearest integer of y  towards \ninfinity. ( )ks  is a vector containing discrete output sequences. The values of ( )ks  can \nbe viewed as symbols, so ( )ks  is called a symbolic sequence. \nOnce the initial conditions ( )0x , the filter parameters of the system \u03b8 , the input u  \nand the number of bits of the quantizers N  are given, the state vector function ( )kx  \n 4\nand the symbolic sequences ( )ks  (or the output sequences of the systems) can be \nuniquely determined by equation (1). \n \nIII. RESULTS \nFigure 1a-1c shows the phase portraits of a bandpass SDM and Figure 1d-1f shows \nthe shifted phase portraits of a bandpass SDM with \n( )158532.0cos 1 \u2212= \u2212\u03b8 , [ ]T113.0\u2212=u , ( ) [ ]T5.000 =x  (7) \nand different values of N . The values of the state variables are bounded by 1\u2212  and 1. \nThis means the system is operating in the quantization region,  \n( ) Lkxi \u2264  for 0\u2265k  and for 2,1=i , (8) \nand the saturation regions ( ( ) Lkxi > ) are not activated. Therefore, as the number of \nbits of the quantizers is increased, the bandpass SDM is a closer approximation of the \ncorresponding linear system. So by estimating the behavior of the system using the \ncorresponding linear model, the system is expected to converge to a fixed point located \nat [ ]T4.04.0 . However, elliptical fractal patterns are exhibited on the phase portrait \neven when a large number of bits (N=37) are used for the implementation of the \nquantizers. \n According to this result, the visual appearance of the phase portraits between the \ninfinite state machine and the finite state machine with high bit quantizers is different. \nThis result is different from the existing results on second-order digital filters with \ntwo\u2019s complement arithmetic [4], where there are visually indistinguishable elliptic \nfractal patterns shown on the phase portraits when 16 bits are used for the \nimplementation of the quantizers. Besides, the fractal pattern may occur for low bit \nquantizers. This result is also different from the existing results [4], in which the fractal \n 5\nbehavior exists only for high bit quantizers. \n \n \n 6\nFigure 1. The phase portraits of bandpass SDMs. (a) 2=N  (b) 3=N . (c) 8=N . \nThe shifted phase portraits of bandpass SDMs. (d) 16=N . (e) 32=N . (f) 37=N .\n \n \n \nMoreover, some interesting results are found. It is shown in Figure 1 that the \ntrajectories converge to a single ellipse when 2=N , while the trajectories exhibit \nelliptic fractal patterns when 3=N , 8=N , 16=N , 32=N  and 37=N . When the \nnumber of bits in the quantizers is increased by one, such as from 2=N  to 3=N , the \ntrajectories change dramatically from a single ellipse to an elliptical fractal pattern. \nBesides, the regions of the elliptical fractal patterns get smaller and smaller as the \nnumber of bits of the quantizers is increased. This means, the amplitudes of the \nnonlinear oscillations are smaller when the number of bits of the quantizers rises. \nNevertheless, the frequency spectra are still very rich. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this letter, some new results on multi-bit bandpass SDMs are presented. It is \nfound that elliptical fractal patterns may be exhibited on the phase plane of multi-bit \nbandpass SDMs even though the saturation regions of the quantizers are not activated \n 7\nand high bit quantizers are used. In addition, we find that a bit change in the quantizers \ncan change the behaviors of the systems dramatically. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe work obtained in this letter was supported by a research grant from Queen \nMary, University of London. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Philip Steiner and Woodward Yang, \u201cA framework for analysis of high-order \nsigma-delta modulators,\u201d IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems\u23afII: Analog \nand Digital Signal Processing, vol. 44, no. 1, pp. 1-10, 1997. \n[2] Stanley P.
