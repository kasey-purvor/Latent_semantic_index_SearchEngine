The broad\nscope of the papers in this open issue - courseware design, collaborative learning,\nevaluation, student use of electronic bibliographic databases, staff development - bears\nwitness to one of the most fascinating aspects of learning technology: its broad-based\ninterdisciplinary nature.\nWe feel strongly that ALT-J should provide a forum for scholarly debate, which reflects the\neclectic nature of learning technology. However, there is a danger that, with a diverse\nprofile, the journal could lose a sense of direction. With this in mind we have identified\nfour areas that we would like to encourage:\n\u2022 The application of learning technology is in its infancy. HE institutions are trying out\ndifferent approaches in an attempt to match the use of technology to local needs and\ndemands. We can all learn from each other in this context, and we see ALT-J as\nproviding opportunities for strategic initiatives to be reported, leading to a discussion\nof issues such as staff training, resourcing and management.\n\u2022 Our view is that ALT-J is a scholarly journal. As such a prime rationale for the journal is\nthe publication of the results of empirical research, and we wish to encourage research\npapers.\n\u2022 The youth of learning technology makes it very important that we think creatively\nabout the future. 'Brain-storming' has a role in thinking creatively about the\neducational use of technology, and we wish to encourage papers that reflect on future\ndevelopments.\n2\nALT-] Volume 7 Number 2\n\u2022 The journal must guard against being parochial. The boundaries in education are being\neroded - notably in the blurring of notions of higher and further education. Likewise\nthe interface between the commercial and industrial sectors and education is becoming\nmore diffuse. Education is becoming more international, in some part due to the\npossibilities afforded by information and communications technology. We intend to\nencourage papers that look to cross-phase developments, explore relationships with\nindustry and commerce, and have international dimensions.\nIn line with these aims we have decided that in addition to the annual conference edition,\nwe will publish a special issue on a key topical theme or research area or work which\nreflects current developments in a particular sector. This will give an annual profile for the\njournal consisting of a special conference issue published in April, an 'open' issue\npublished in July, and a special thematic issue published in November. In this way we hope\nthat we will provide an opportunity for a wide range of papers to be published in a focused\nway, to reflect the four key themes of the journal.\nTo launch this new format, Issue 7.3 will develop the fourth aspect outlined above by\nfocusing on work from the commercial sector and in particular will describe the\neducational work associated with the BT Laboratories at Martlesham Heath. The work in\nthe BT Laboratories picks up on all four of the themes we have identified: interdisciplinary\nresearch and development, links between further and higher education, relationships with\nindustry and commerce, and state-of-the-art research and development in learning\ntechnology. We would welcome suggestions for the next special edition to be published in\nNovember 2000.\nDavid Squires and Gr\u00e1inne Conole\n3\n"}
