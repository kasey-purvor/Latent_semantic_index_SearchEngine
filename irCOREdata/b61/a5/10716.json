Six experienced national youth male butterfly\nswimmers undertook a maximal effort repeated sprint\ntest set, during which swimmers were filmed with two underwater\nand two above water cameras (oblique plane) at 50Hz.\nThe whole body was digitised during a full stroke cycle for each\nview, with the three-dimensional coordinates being obtained\nusing a DLT algorithm. The results of this study indicate that\nas swimming speed decreased (i) stroke rate decreased while stroke length remained relatively constant, (ii) hand movement\npatterns remained similar while changes in elbow angle suggested\nthat the effectiveness of joint flexors and extensors may\nhave been reduced, (iii) the Upsweep, Recovery and Catch\nappear to the critical stroke phases when swimmers become\nfatigued.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.fade.up.pt\/rpcd\/_arquivo\/RPCD_vol.6_supl.2.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>Revista Portuguesa de Ciencias do Desporto<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2010-03-02T11:14:43Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>Portuguese journal of sports sciences, 2006, vol. 6, no. suppl 2, pp. 70-73<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1645-0523<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/93360<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.fade.up.pt\/rpcd\/entrada_ingles.html<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.fade.up.pt\/rpcd\/_arquivo\/RPCD_vol.6_supl.2.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"pt","id":35,"name":"Portuguese"},"relations":["http:\/\/www.fade.up.pt\/rpcd\/entrada_ingles.html","http:\/\/www.fade.up.pt\/rpcd\/_arquivo\/RPCD_vol.6_supl.2.pdf"],"year":2010,"topics":["Repeated sprinting","Kinematics","Butterfly swimming"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
