To improve current treatment strategies, we have combined comprehensive chemical-genomic screening in\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae and validation in C. albicans with the goal of identifying compounds that can couple with the\nfungistatic drug fluconazole to make it fungicidal. Among the genes identified in the yeast screen, we found that only AGE3,\nwhich codes for an ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase activating effector protein, abrogates fluconazole tolerance in C.\nalbicans. The age3 mutant was more sensitive to other sterols and cell wall inhibitors, including caspofungin. The deletion of\nAGE3 in drug resistant clinical isolates and in constitutively active calcineurin signaling mutants restored fluconazole\nsensitivity. We confirmed chemically the AGE3-dependent drug sensitivity by showing a potent fungicidal synergy between\nfluconazole and brefeldin A (an inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ADP ribosylation factors) in wild\ntype C. albicans as well as in drug resistant clinical isolates. Addition of calcineurin inhibitors to the fluconazole\/brefeldin A\ncombination only initially improved pathogen killing. Brefeldin A synergized with different drugs in non-albicans Candida\nspecies as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. Microarray studies showed that core transcriptional responses to two different drug\nclasses are not significantly altered in age3 mutants. The therapeutic potential of inhibiting ARF activities was demonstrated\nby in vivo studies that showed age3 mutants are avirulent in wild type mice, attenuated in virulence in\nimmunocompromised mice and that fluconazole treatment was significantly more efficacious when ARF signaling was\ngenetically compromised. This work describes a new, widely conserved, broad-spectrum mechanism involved in fungal drug\nresistance and virulence and offers a potential route for single or improved combination therapies.\nCitation: Epp E, Vanier G, Harcus D, Lee AY, Jansen G, et al.

Particularly affected are immu-\nnocompromised individuals with cancer or AIDS, people\nundergoing organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n(HSCT), and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy or\nimplantable prosthetic devices [1,2]. The growing population of\nthese at-risk groups is reflected in an increase in invasive fungal\ninfection over the last three decades [3]. Annual treatment costs\nfor fungal therapies reach $2.6 billion in the US alone [4]. Despite\navailable therapy options mortality rates approaching 30\u201350%\n(Candida species) and 30\u201380% (Aspergillus species) remain high [5,6].\nCandida and Aspergillus species together account for ,70% of all\ninvasive fungal infections, with Candida albicans and Aspergillus\nfumigatus predominating [7,8,9]. Currently, three classes of\nantifungal drugs are suitable for treatment of systemic infections\ncaused by these fungi: polyenes (most notably amphotericin B) and\nazoles (e.g. fluconazole, FCZ) have been applied for decades, while\nthe echinocandins (e.g. caspofungin, CF) represent a new class of\nantifungal that has entered treatment regimes over the past 10\nyears [10,11]. While these therapy options can be effective, they\nalso exhibit several shortcomings. First, current antifungals target a\nvery limited number of biological processes. The majority of\navailable drugs target ergosterol (polyenes) or inhibit lanosterol\n14a-demethylase (azoles), resulting in the accumulation of toxic\nsterol intermediates that disrupt membrane integrity and lead to\nmembrane stress. Because ergosterol, the major sterol in fungal\ncell membranes, is analogous to the mammalian lipid cholesterol,\nthis strategy, particularly when amphotericin B is applied, can be\nproblematic due to host toxicity [10]. Another complication of\ncurrent antifungal strategies is that available drugs each possess a\ndifferent spectrum of antifungal activities. For instance, azoles are\ntypically fungistatic against pathogenic yeasts such as Candida\nspecies, but fungicidal against molds (Aspergillus species). CF, on the\nother hand, is fungicidal against yeasts and fungistatic against\nmolds [12]. Finally, and most importantly, the small number of\ntreatment options available has resulted in widespread drug\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nresistance in pathogenic species. For each of the three major\nclasses of antifungals (polyenes, azoles, echinocandins) isolation of\ndrug-resistant clinical strains has been reported [11,12,13]; azole-\nresistant Candida, in particular, is now common among isolates\nfrom HIV-positive patients [14]. Developing new antifungal\nstrategies, therefore, remains a pressing need.\nOne approach to satisfy this need is through combination\nantifungal therapy, where two (or more) agents combined are\nsignificantly more efficacious compared to either agent alone. This\napproach has recently been validated in a randomized, placebo-\ncontrolled trial, where approved antifungals were combined with\nimmune regulatory agents [15]. Results from this study suggested\nthat combining ergosterol inhibitors with a recombinant human\nmonoclonal antibody against heat-shock 90 protein (HSP90)\nshowed increased therapeutic benefits compared to monotherapy\nagainst Candida infection. Although the precise mechanisms\ninvolved remain elusive [16], extensive experiments have further\nestablished the benefits of such combinatorial approaches. For\ninstance, a potent synergy resulted when inhibitors of HSP90\n(geldanamycin, radicicol) or inhibitors of HSP90\u2019s key client\nprotein, calcineurin (cyclosporin A (CsA), FK506) were combined\neither with azoles or echinocandins against C. albicans\n[10,16,17,18,19,20,21]. Similarly, pharmacological compromise\nof HSP90\/calcineurin-signaling enhanced the efficaciousness of\nechinocandin treatment against A. fumigatus in vitro as well as in\ninsect and mouse infection models [16,17]. Although these\nexamples clearly demonstrate the potential for combination\nantifungal therapy, human host toxicity associated with inhibition\nof HSP90 or suppression of the human immune system by CsA\/\nFK506 currently precludes the use of such inhibitors in the clinic\n[16,22]. While a non-immunosuppressive FK506 analogue (L-685,\n818) has been identified, proprietary restrictions have currently\nprevented further testing [22]. Therefore, identification of new\nantifungal targets for optimal fungal killing remains a priority.\nOne of the challenges of finding new antifungal targets in C.\nalbicans is the lack of sophisticated screening technologies often\nemployed with, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Various large-\nscale chemical-genomic drug screening methods are now well\nestablished in S. cerevisiae, and have been effective for elucidating\ndrug targets or revealing insights into the modes of action of\nbioactive compounds [23,24,25,26,27]. Similar approaches have\nonly recently been applied directly to fungal pathogens [28]. Using\nS. cerevisiae as a model, we previously performed chemical-genomics\nto systematically analyze the genetic requirements to survive FCZ\ntreatment [29]. In that work, we identified 22 genes that become\nessential for S. cerevisiae survival in the presence of FCZ.\nHere, we expanded that work with the aim of identifying\nsynergistic drug interactions that render FCZ fungicidal in C.\nalbicans. To this end, we validated the S. cerevisiae FCZ-cidal gene\nset [29] in C. albicans. From 22 predicted genes, we found that only\none gene, AGE3, mediated FCZ tolerance in the pathogen. We\nfurther show that both genetic and pharmacological compromise\nof ARF (ADP ribosylation factor) activities, a process that depends\non Age3p, creates sensitivity to all three classes of antifungals used\nin clinics (polyenes, azoles, echinocandins), overrides clinical drug\nresistance and the calcineurin pathway, synergizes with fungistatic\ndrugs against the two major pathogenic fungal species (C. albicans\nand A. fumigatus) and modifies fungal virulence in two established\nmouse models of candidiasis. Given that drug treatment in mice\nwas significantly more efficacious when ARF activity was\ngenetically compromised, this demonstrates that targeting ARF\nsignaling has potential for antifungal therapies.\nResults\nAge3p mediates azole tolerance and sensitivity to cell\nwall inhibitors in C. albicans\nTo identify genes that become essential for survival in the\npresence of FCZ, we previously screened the non-essential S.\ncerevisiae knock-out collection (about 4900 strains) and identified 22\nmutants that showed a robust FCZ-cidal phenotype [29]. BLAST\nsearches identified C. albicans homologs for 21 of those S. cerevisiae\ngenes. YDR532c appears to be the only gene that lacks a clear C.\nalbicans homolog (Table S1). Recreating knockout or transposon\ninsertion mutations of the 21 candidate genes in C. albicans, we\nfound that four mutants (bem2, sac6, srb8 and ssn3) showed FCZ\nsensitivity comparable to WT (Table S2, Figure S1). Twelve C.\nalbicans mutants (57%) showed increased FCZ sensitivity, but all of\nthese mutants could still resume growth when incubated for\nextended time in the presence of FCZ. Four genes (GCN5, NGG1,\nERG11 and NUP84) were linked to a slightly resistant FCZ\nphenotype. Only one mutant, age3 (ORF19.3683), showed the FCZ\nsensitive phenotype predicted from the yeast screen. We therefore\nfocused further investigation on AGE3.\nWe validated the FCZ sensitivity of age3 cells by three different\nassays. When tested in a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nassay, the age3 mutant initially showed similar drug sensitivity as\nWT and revertant strains at 24 hours. Since FCZ on its own is\nfungistatic, however, WT cells demonstrated robust growth above\nthe initial MIC point after prolonged incubation (72 hours), a\nfeature referred to as tolerance [19]. In contrast, age3 cells did not\nresume growth above the 24 hours MIC point, indicating that age3\nmutants lost tolerance to FCZ (Figure 1A, Table S2). These results\nwere confirmed visually by growth on solid rich media in the\npresence of FCZ (Figure 1B). We further characterized the FCZ\nsensitivity of age3 cells by time-kill curves. Under FCZ treatment,\nthe number of viable age3 cells slightly decreased over time, while\ngrowth of WT cells in the presence of FCZ continued (Figure 1C).\nAuthor Summary\nCandida albicans is a fungus that normally resides as part\nof the microflora in the human gut. Candida species can\ncause superficial infections like thrush in the healthy\nhuman population and life-threatening invasive infections\nin immunocompromised patients. Fungal infections are\noften treated with azole drugs, but due to the fungistatic\nnature of these agents, C. albicans can develop drug\nresistance, leading to therapy failure. To improve the\naction of azoles and convert them into fungicidal drugs,\nwe first systematically analyzed the genetic requirements\nfor tolerance to one such azole drug, fluconazole. We\nshow, both genetically and pharmacologically, that com-\nponents of the ARF cycling machinery are critical in\nmediating both azole and echinocandin tolerance in C.\nalbicans as well as several other pathogenic Candida\nspecies and in the pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus.\nWe highlight the importance of ARF cycling in drug\nresistance by showing that genetic compromise of ARF\nfunctions overrides common drug resistance mechanisms\nin clinical samples and other key regulators of azole\/\nechinocandin tolerance. We validated the therapeutic\npotential of ARF cycling in two mouse models and provide\nevidence that drug treatment is more efficacious when\nARF activities are genetically compromised. Our study\ndemonstrates a new mechanism involved in two impor-\ntant aspects of the biology of human fungal pathogens\nand provides a potential route for improved antifungal\ntherapies.\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nWe then tested the age3 mutant against a variety of antifungals\nto gauge the specificity of the mutation. We included various\ncompounds, including second-generation azoles (voriconazole),\nnon-azole ergosterol inhibitors (terbinafine) and other membrane-\ntargeting drugs (amphotericin B). We found that age3 cells showed\na generalized increased sensitivity to these compounds\n(Figure 1D). Among all cell-membrane drugs tested, the azoles\ncaused by far the most significant enhancement in sensitivity in\nthe age3 mutant.\nIn order to determine the effect of deleting AGE3 on the\nintegrity of the cell wall, we tested the age3 mutant for sensitivity to\na variety of cell wall perturbing agents and other agents whose\neffect have been linked to altered cell wall and glycosylation. The\nage3 mutant was slightly more sensitive to the b-1,3 glucan\nsynthase inhibitor CF. Similarly, age3 cells were slightly more\nsensitive to calcofluor white, a phenotype that is usually associated\nwith altered chitin structures along the cell wall [30]. More\nremarkably, age3 cells were extremely sensitive to hygromycin B, a\nphenotype usually seen in glycosylation mutants [31,32]\n(Figure 1D, 1E). No change in sensitivity was observed in the\npresence of other agents such as caffeine, cycloheximide,\nmenadione, nocodazole, rapamycin, 5-FC and wortmannin (data\nnot shown). Together, these data suggest that while AGE3 plays a\nmajor role during membrane stress in C. albicans, its influence on\nthe integrity of the cell wall remains somewhat less clear (see\ndiscussion).\nFigure 1. Age3p plays a major role in azole tolerance in C. albicans. (A) Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assay in rich YPD media\nshowing that age3 cells are initially almost equally sensitive to FCZ compared to WT and revertant strains (24 hours reading, top), but fail to grow\nabove this MIC threshold after prolonged incubation (72 hours reading, middle). MIC assays with two-fold serially diluted drug concentrations were\ndone in duplicate and optical densities were normalized to drug-free control wells (see color bar). After 72 hours of incubation, 2 ml of each well of\nthe MIC assay was spotted on fresh YPD media to assess the extent to which cells recover from the drug treatments (bottom). YPD recovery plates\nwere incubated for 24 hours at 30uC. (B) FCZ sensitivity assayed on solid YPD media. No age3 colonies grew on YPD plates containing 24 hours-supra-\nMIC concentrations of FCZ. Overnight cultures were adjusted to OD600 of 0.1, and then serially diluted four-fold, before 2 ml were spotted on plates.\nPlates were incubated for 48 hours at 30uC. (C) Time-kill curves in YPD media confirming that knocking out AGE3 abrogates tolerance to FCZ. The\nnumber of viable age3 cells decreases slightly over time, while growth of WT cells in the presence of FCZ still occurs. FCZ was used at 10 mg\/ml.\nShown is the average of two independent experiments plus SD values. Note that age3 cells grow as efficiently as WT cells in the absence of drugs. (D)\nMIC assays in YPD media shows that age3 mutants are extremely sensitive to numerous azoles after 48 hours and mildly more sensitive to non-azole\nergosterol inhibitors (terbinafine, amphotericin B) as well as cell wall inhibitors when compared to WT cells. Fold reduction represents the ratio of the\nMIC value for WT over the MIC value of the age3 mutant. (E) age3 cells show differential sensitivity to different cell wall inhibitors on YPD media\nplates. The assay was done as described in (B).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.g001\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 3 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nDeleting AGE3 overrides clinical drug resistance and the\ncalcineurin pathway\nAmong the most commonly encountered resistance mechanisms\nin drug treated clinical C. albicans isolates are over-expression of\ndrug pumps or alterations in sterol biosynthesis [13,33,34]. To test\nwhether such common mechanisms of drug resistance are still\neffective in the absence of AGE3, we deleted AGE3 in two FCZ-\nresistant clinical strains. The strain F5 carries a mutation in the\ntranscription factor MRR1, which leads to constitutive over-\nexpression of drug pumps. The strain S2 carries a mutation in the\ntranscription factor UPC2, which causes up-regulation of ergos-\nterol biosynthesis genes [35,36]. Figure 2A shows that deleting\nAGE3 in strains F5 and S2 restored FCZ sensitivity even below\nWT levels, suggesting that loss of AGE3 abrogates FCZ-resistance\nin these clinical isolates.\nBecause age3 mutants lost tolerance to FCZ and because the\ncalcineurin pathway is known to mediate FCZ-tolerance in WT as\nwell as drug resistant clinical isolates [10,19], we tested whether\nconstitutive calcineurin signaling could reverse the AGE3-depen-\ndent FCZ sensitivity. The calcineurin pathway can be activated by\naddition of extracellular CaCl2 [19]. C. albicans WT became\nresistant to FCZ after only 24 hours of growth in the presence of\nextracellular CaCl2, while this rescue was not observed in the\nabsence of AGE3 (Figure 2B). To further verify this observation, we\ndeleted AGE3 in a constitutively active calcineurin signaling\nmutant (DSY2146) that is resistant to FCZ even in the absence of\nextracellular CaCl2 [19]. Deleting AGE3 in this constitutively\nactive calcineurin mutant restored FCZ sensitivity both in the\nabsence and in the presence of extracellular CaCl2 (Figure 2B).\nThese results suggest that constitutive calcineurin signaling does\nnot rescue the age3-dependent FCZ sensitivity. The results also\nsupport an argument that AGE3 and calcineurin-dependent\nprocesses could be linked (see discussion).\nPharmacological compromise of ARF cycling converts\nFCZ into a fungicidal drug in C. albicans\nGiven AGE3\u2019s role in sensitivity to various drugs and its\nimplication in clinically relevant processes such as drug resistance,\ntargeting either AGE3 or its biological process seemed a plausible\navenue for combination therapies to render FCZ fungicidal. The\nS. cerevisiae homolog of C. albicans AGE3 is GCS1, which encodes an\nARF GAP (ADP-Ribosylation Factor GTPase Activating Protein)\n[37]. ARFs are small G-proteins of the Ras GTPase superfamily\nthat cycle between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-\nbound state. ARF guanine nucleotide cycling, and hence function,\nis regulated by GAPs and GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange\nfactors) [38]. ARFs are involved in a variety of processes including\nvesicle trafficking (Golgi-to-ER retrograde vesicle trafficking, trans\nGolgi network-endosomal transport, transport from the Golgi to\nthe membrane) and actin cytoskeleton organization [39,40,41,42].\nBrefeldin A (BFA), a metabolite from the fungus Penicillium\ndecumbens, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of ARF activity. Protein\ncrystal structures showed that BFA binds to a ternary complex of\nARF-GDP-GEF, thus stabilizing this otherwise transient protein-\nprotein interaction [43,44,45,46,47,48]. Given that ARF cycling is\na well-established target of BFA, we reasoned that BFA might be\nFigure 2. Deleting AGE3 overrides clinical drug resistance and the calcineurin pathway.

(B) Calcineurin signaling stimulated either by extracellular CaCl2 or\nby a constitutively active mutation in strain DSY2146 leads to FCZ resistance. age3 mutants do not respond to extracellular CaCl2, while knocking out\nAGE3 in strain DSY2146 restored FCZ sensitivity. Disc diffusion assays were done by plating 26105 cells on YPD plates followed by applying discs\ncontaining 50 mg of FCZ to the surface of agar. Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 30uC.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.g002\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nan ideal drug to synergize with FCZ in WT C. albicans by\nchemically mimicking the age3-dependent FCZ sensitivity. As\nillustrated by time-kill curves in Figure 3A, combining FCZ with\nBFA resulted in a potent fungicidal synergy in WT C. albicans,\nwhile either drug alone had only minor effects on cell growth. To\ncompare the BFA\/FCZ synergy to a well-established fungicidal\nsynergy, we repeated the time-kill curves with CsA in combination\nwith FCZ. CsA\/FCZ co-treatment resulted in a similarly strong\nsynthetic phenotype after 24 hours. This observation corroborates\nprevious findings that calcineurin inhibition plus FCZ results in a\npotent fungicidal combination as assayed at 24 hours of drug\ntreatment [19]. A triple drug combination of FCZ\/BFA\/CsA was\nsignificantly more efficacious than either FCZ\/CsA or FCZ\/BFA\nalone at 24 hours. However, when monitored for more than\n24 hours, conditions that have not previously been reported [19],\ncells treated with FCZ\/CsA could recover and resume growth,\nwhile cells treated with FCZ\/BFA or FCZ\/BFA\/CsA could not\nresume growth above the detection limit (<10 cells\/ml). At\n72 hours, drug combinations of either FCZ\/BFA or FCZ\/BFA\/\nCsA appeared equally efficacious with no evidence of growth,\nwhile cells treated with FCZ\/CsA continued to proliferate. Similar\nresults were obtained when another calcineurin inhibitor, FK506,\nwas combined with FCZ. These results suggest that while the\ncombination of calcineurin inhibitors and an azole is initially\nefficient in pathogen killing, over prolonged drug treatment,\ncombining ARF inhibitors with azoles is more efficacious.\nA dose-matrix titration assay measuring growth of treated cells\nconfirmed the synergy between FCZ\/BFA (Figure 3B, Table S3).\nFigure 3. Pharmacological inhibition of ARF cycling results in a potent, fungicidal synergy in combination with FCZ in C. albicans. (A)\nTime-kill curves demonstrating that, while combining FCZ and BFA was initially equally efficacious in pathogen killing compared to combining FCZ\nand calcineurin inhibitors (FK506 or CsA), extended drug exposure only remained efficacious in pairwise BFA\/FCZ combinations. Triple drug\ncombinations of BFA\/FCZ\/calcineurin inhibitors were only initially (24 hours) more efficacious, but at 72 hours appeared equally efficacious\ncompared to BFA\/FCZ. The assay was done in YPD media. Drugs were used at 10 mg\/ml for FCZ, 15 mg\/ml for BFA, 1 mg\/ml for CsA and 1 mg\/ml for\nFK506. (B) Dose-matrix titration assay confirming the FCZ\/BFA synergy in WT and drug resistant clinical isolates 5674, S2 and F5 in rich YPD media\n(top). Dose-matrix titration plates were incubated for 72 hours after which aliquots of each well were spotted on fresh YPD recovery plates (bottom).\nNo-growth of recovery plates confirmed fungal cell death of the drug synergy. Recovery plates were incubated for 24 hours. Dose-matrix titration\nassays were analyzed as described for MIC assays in Figure 1A.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.g003\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nWe also tested whether the FCZ\/BFA synergy is still effective in C.\nalbicans drug resistant clinical isolates and found that, although\nconsiderably higher concentrations of FCZ were needed, there was\nsynergy in isolates F5 and S2 as well as in isolate 5674, which\ncarries a gain-of-function mutation in TAC1, a transcriptional\nactivator of CDR drug efflux pump genes [49]. Thus, genetic\ncompromise of ARF cycling by deleting AGE3 abrogated FCZ\ntolerance, while pharmacological compromise of ARF cycling by\nadding BFA converted the fungistatic drug FCZ into a fungicidal\nagent in WT and FCZ-resistant C. albicans clinical isolates.\nTogether, this suggests that the process of ARF cycling becomes\nessential during cell membrane stress in this pathogen.\nCombining ARF inhibition with other drugs across fungal\nspecies\nImportantly, genetic or pharmacological compromise of ARF\ncycling did not appear to significantly affect the cells\u2019 initial\nresponse to FCZ (Figure 1A, 3B, Table S2). Instead, ARF cycling\ninhibition seems to act on tolerance. To test whether the effect of\nBFA on tolerance is observed in combination with other azole\ndrugs, we tested miconazole (MICO) and ketoconazole (KETO) in\ncombination with BFA, because MICO and KETO alone did\nshow a tolerance effect (Figure 4A). When tested in a dose-matrix\ntitration format, BFA synergized with MICO and KETO against\nWT C. albicans, independently of which media were used\n(Figure 4A, Figure S2).\nAlthough CF is generally considered fungicidal in C. albicans, we\ntested whether BFA would synergize with CF. Recent reports\nshowed that C. albicans can start to grow at supra MIC\nconcentrations of CF, an outcome referred to as the paradoxical\nor trailing growth effect [50,51]. BFA did synergize with CF against\nWT C. albicans in a dose matrix titration assay at supra MIC\nconcentrations of CF (Figure 4B). Together, these results indicate\nthat genetic and pharmacological compromise of ARF cycling\ninfluences not only cell membrane stress, but also cell wall stress.\nTo examine whether BFA\u2019s inhibition of azole tolerance is\nconserved across other pathogenic Candida species, we tested BFA\/\ndrug interactions in C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata and C.\nkrusei. Together, these species account for ,30\u201340% of all Candida\nisolates causing invasive infections; furthermore, C. glabrata and C.\nkrusei are notoriously difficult to treat with FCZ [7,8,12]. C.\ntropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata showed tolerance in the\npresence of FCZ, MICO and KETO (Figure 5A); these azoles\nsynergized with BFA in dose-matrix titration assays with these\nfungi. FCZ also synergized with BFA in the non-pathogenic yeast\nS. cerevisiae (data not shown). On the other hand, C. krusei did not\nshow an obvious tolerance effect (i.e. .2 fold variations between\n24 hours and 72 hours MIC readings), which could explain why\nBFA did not synergize with azoles in this pathogen (Figure 5B).\nTo further investigate ARF cycling inhibition as a mechanism\nof abrogating drug tolerance in non-Candida human fungal\npathogens, we asked whether BFA would synergize with FCZ or\nCF against A. fumigatus. Consistent with the idea that ARF\ncycling inhibition acts primarily on tolerance, a disc diffusion\nassay in A. fumigatus demonstrated that BFA synergized with CF,\na drug that is generally fungistatic in A. fumigatus (Figure 6). CF\ntreatment created an inhibition zone against A. fumigatus where\ncells could still grow within that zone due to the fungistatic\nnature of CF. In contrast, when BFA was combined with CF,\nnot only was the size of that inhibition zone increased, but\ngrowth within that zone was also remarkably reduced. A MIC\nassay in defined synthetic media independently confirmed that\nCF synergized with BFA against A. fumigatus (Table S3). On the\nother hand, we found that BFA did not synergize with FCZ, a\ndrug that is considered fungicidal in A. fumigatus (data not\nshown) [12]. In general, pharmacological compromise of ARF\ncycling in A. fumigatus was not as efficacious as in Candida species,\npossibly because BFA on its own had a more pronounced\nimpact on growth of A. fumigatus compared to Candida species\n(Figure 6, Table S3). Taken together, these results show that\nFigure 4. Pharmacological compromise of ARF cycling synergizes with various azoles as well as the cell wall inhibitor CF. (A) MIC\nassays in YPD media demonstrated that WT C. albicans shows tolerance to MICO and KETO (top, compare 24 hours to 72 hours MIC readings).\nCombining BFA with either MICO or KETO resulted in a similarly potent fungicidal combination compared to BFA\/FCZ (bottom).

We therefore\nperformed microarray studies to test how transcriptional regula-\ntion is altered in age3 mutants. We first compared WT to age3 cells\nin the absence of drugs and found that 23 genes were differentially\nregulated when AGE3 was absent (Table S4). Among those 23\ngenes were five GPI-anchored cell wall proteins (ECM331, PGA13,\nCRH11, SAP9, PGA26) and two genes with phospholipase activity\n(FGR22 and PI-PLC). Because none of these genes have been\nlinked to FCZ tolerance, it is currently unclear how they might\ninfluence the age3-dependent drug phenotypes.\nWe next analyzed the transcriptional response to FCZ. A typical\ntranscriptional signature to FCZ is upregulation of ergosterol\ngenes, presumably to compensate for depletion of these membrane\nlipids [54,55]. This core response to FCZ was not changed in the\nabsence of AGE3. All ergosterol genes that became significantly\nupregulated in FCZ-treated WT cells were similarly upregulated\nin FCZ-treated age3 cells (Table S5). Besides this core response to\nFCZ, clustering analysis of genes that were significantly regulated\n(.2 fold expression change and p-value ,0.05) further confirmed\nthat the overall transcriptional response to FCZ was very similar in\nWT and age3 cells (Figure S3A, Table S6).\nA similar lack of AGE3-dependent transcriptional consequences\ncould be observed in microarray experiments when the cell wall\ninhibitor CF was used. Clustering analysis revealed that CF-\ntreated WT cells and CF-treated age3 cells showed an almost\nidentical transcriptional response, with a significant overlap (p-\nvalue 4.86102194) of differentially regulated genes (Figure S3B,\nTables S7, S8). This overlap of 168 genes showed further\nstatistically significant similarity (p-value 1.861027) when com-\npared to core C. albicans CF-responsive genes previously identified\nin two independent studies [52,56]. Therefore, the core transcrip-\ntional response to CF in C. albicans seems not to depend on AGE3.\nIn summary, these microarray experiments suggest that deleting\nAGE3 does not cause major transcriptional changes in the\npresence of two different drug classes and further indicates that\npost-transcriptional processes might play a more dominant role in\nterms of ARF cycling-dependent drug phenotypes.\nThe age3 mutant is avirulent in WT mice\nTo evaluate whether AGE3 is a good drug target in vivo, we first\ninjected age3 mutant cells into WT B6 mice, and found that age3\ncells are avirulent in this mouse model. While 100% of mice\ninfected with WT C. albicans became moribund within 11 days\npost-infection, none of the age3 mutant strain infected mice\nbecame moribund during the same time frame (Figure 7A). To\ntest whether mice infected with age3 cells had cleared the\ninfection, we sacrificed half of the mutant group on day 11 to\nanalyze kidney fungal burden (Figure 7B). On average, kidney\nfungal load was significantly reduced (p-value ,0.01, Mann\nWhitney test) in the age3 group compared to moribund WT-\ninfected mice. We continued with the other half of age3 mutant-\ninfected mice until the end of the experiment (day 21), but again\nfound that none of the age3-infected mice became moribund.\nComparing fungal load from these mice showed that three mice\nhad cleared the infection, while two mice had a fungal load that\nwas comparable to WT-infected mice. On average, however,\nthere were significantly fewer age3 cells recovered from the\nhost compared to moribund mice infected with WT C. albicans (p-\nvalue ,0.02, Figure 7B).\nOne key virulence factor in C. albicans pathogenicity is hyphal\nformation [57]. Because Arnold Bito and coworkers (Lettner T.,\nZeidler U., Gimona M., Breitenbach M., Bito A., manuscript\nsubmitted, personal communication from A. Bito) have\nobserved some hyphal formation defects on solid media as well\nas defects in invasive growth in age3 mutants, we collected\nkidneys for histological examination on day 11 from both WT-\ninfected and age3-infected mice. No obvious difference was\nfound between kidney sections recovered from WT or from age3-\ninfected mice (Figure 7C). In all kidney sections examined, age3\ncells could be observed as elongated hyphal structures.\nTherefore, it remains unclear why age3-infected mice with a\nhigh fungal burden did not show any clinical signs, but might\nindicate that additional virulence factors are affected in age3\nmutants.\nGenetic inhibition of ARF cycling results in attenuated\nvirulence in an immunocompromised mouse model of\ndisseminated candidiasis and FCZ treatment is\nsignificantly more efficacious when ARF activity is\ngenetically compromised\nTo help evaluate the therapeutic potential of FCZ treatment of\nage3 mutant-infected mice, we required a mouse model where age3\ncells retain at least partial virulence.

In this\nvery sensitive animal system, C. albicans WT and revertant-infected\nA\/J mice became rapidly moribund after 20 to 24 hours, while\nage3 mutant-infected A\/J mice survived significantly longer, with\na median survival of two days (p-value ,0.02, Log-rank test)\n(Figure 8A). However, comparing fungal burden indicated that\nmice infected with C. albicans age3 cells accumulated a significantly\nhigher fungal load when moribund (p-value ,0.02), with hyphal\nformation still observed in the age3 mutant-infected mice\n(Figure 8B, data not shown).\nTo test whether genetic compromise of ARF activity holds\ntherapeutic potential, we repeated this experiment and injected\nWT, age3 and the revertant strains in A\/J mice to compare\nsurvival lengths after two days of FCZ therapy. FCZ adminis-\ntration extended survival of all three groups (p-value ,0.001), but\nwas significantly more efficacious in the mutant-infected mice,\nextending median survival time more than 10-fold compared to\n7.5-fold median survival time extension for both the WT and\nrevertant groups (p-value ,0.01 for posthoc comparison between\nage3 mutant group with and without FCZ, versus p-value .0.05\nposthoc comparison between WT with and without FCZ or p-\nvalue .0.05 for posthoc comparison between revertant with and\nwithout FCZ, Dunnett\u2019s Multiple Comparison) (Figure 8C). In\nsummary, we conclude from these in vivo experiments that genetic\ncompromise of ARF cycling results in avirulence in WT mice,\nsignificant attenuation in virulence in an immunocompromised\nmouse model and further suggests that FCZ treatment in A\/J\nmice is more efficacious when ARF cycling is genetically\ncompromised.\nDiscussion\nIdentifying new drug targets is an important step in the\nchallenging task of developing new antifungal therapies, which are\nurgently needed due to the emergence of drug resistance to every\nclass of antifungals currently in clinical use [11,59]. Using a\ncomprehensive reverse-genetics screen, we identified Age3p and\nthe process of ARF cycling as potential new drug targets. We\nfurther established a widely conserved, potent fungicidal chemical\nsynergy between the ARF cycling inhibitor BFA and several\nfungistatic drugs, and, through two murine infection models,\nvalidated the potential of ARF cycling as an antifungal target.\nTo render FCZ fungicidal through combination with other\ndrugs, we applied a large-scale chemical-genomic approach in S.\ncerevisiae and found 22 FCZ-cidal genes (Table S1) [29]. The S.\ncerevisiae screen proved to have predictive power in that 12 of the\n22 genes (57%) identified in S. cerevisiae were validated in C. albicans\nwith an increased FCZ sensitivity (Figure S1, Table S2). Among\nthose genes, only CDR1 and ADA2 have previously been linked to\nFCZ sensitivity in C. albicans [52,60]. On the other hand, our\nscreen linked four genes to FCZ resistance in the pathogen\n(NUP84, ERG11, GCN5 and NGG1). One of those genes, ERG11,\nhas previously been linked to FCZ resistance in C. albicans [61]. Of\nnote, Sanglard and coworkers have shown that the C. albicans erg11\nmutant was sensitive to a variety of drugs, including BFA [61].\nTwo other C. albicans genes that have been linked to FCZ\nresistance in our screen (GCN5 and NGG1) are part of the SAGA, a\nconserved transcriptional co-activator [62]. Our data therefore\nexpand the known events of transcriptional rewiring between S.\ncerevisiae and C. albicans in regards of drug resistance [63,64], as\nFigure 7. Genetic compromise of ARF cycling in C. albicans results in avirulence in a WT mouse model of disseminated disease.

The observation that different subunits of the same\ntranscriptional co-activator complex regulate the opposing phe-\nnotypes of drug sensitivity or drug resistance illustrates the extreme\nadaptability and flexibility of transcriptional regulatory networks\nin fungi.\nGiven that diverse essential processes exhibit significantly\ndifferent regulation in S. cerevisiae and C. albicans [65,66,67],\nreorganization of transcriptional regulation might in general\naccount for C. albicans mutants that showed different drug\nphenotypes compared to the yeast prediction. Despite these\nconsiderations, budding yeast genetics remains a convenient and\npowerful approach to predict phenotypes in pathogenic fungal\nspecies, at least until similar sophisticated screening techniques\nbecome available in the pathogen itself.\nAn alternative speculation why the success rate of our screen\nwas not higher is that the gene encoding ERG11, the target of FCZ\nin both species, is essential only in S. cerevisiae [29,61]. Thus, there\nmay be redundant mechanisms for sterol biosynthesis in C. albicans,\na suggestion that is further supported by the observation that\nanother ergosterol biosynthesis gene, ERG24, is essential in S.\ncerevisiae, but not in C. albicans [68].\nChemical compromise of ARF cycling appeared far more\npotent than genetic compromise. When age3 mutants were treated\nwith FCZ, the number of viable cells was reduced in time-kill\ncurve experiments by less than one log value, whereas combining\nFCZ with BFA reduced the number of viable WT cells more than\none log value over the same time (Figure 1C, Figure 3A). Similarly,\nchemical compromise appeared more potent than genetic\ncompromise in terms of synergy with CF. The age3 mutant was\nonly 2-fold more sensitive to CF than WT. On the other hand,\ncombining BFA with CF resulted in a 32-fold reduction in\nsensitivity to CF in WT cells (Figure 1D and 1E, Figure 4B). These\ndifferences likely reflect that, while chemical interference with\nARF function inhibits potentially all ARF GEFs, genetic\ninactivation was restricted to one ARF GAP (AGE3). Thus, it\nremains possible that some aspects of ARF signaling continue to\nfunction in the absence of AGE3 under drug conditions, a\nsuggestion that is supported by work in yeast that demonstrated\nthat several ARF GAPs provide redundant functions [39,40].\nThe finding that both genetic and pharmacological blockage of\nARF function result in increased azole sensitivity suggests that,\namong the multiple cellular roles described for the yeast\nhomologue of AGE3, defects in proper ARF cycling and, therefore,\ndefects in intracellular vesicle trafficking are responsible for drug\nphenotypes. One hypothesis to explain how incorrect vesicle\ntrafficking could result in age3-dependent drug sensitivity is\nmislocalization of drug pumps. However, CDR1 and MDR1, two\nmajor drug pumps in C. albicans appear not be involved, as Arnold\nBito and coworkers (Lettner T., Zeidler U., Gimona M.,\nBreitenbach M., Bito A., manuscript submitted, personal com-\nmunication from A. Bito) observed that CDR1 and MDR1 pumps\nare correctly localized to the plasma membrane in age3 mutants.\nThey further established that CDR1 drug pump activity was not\naffected in the absence of AGE3.\nAnother plausible explanation that could account for the azole\nsensitivity of age3mutants is defects in the biosynthesis of ergosterol\nor problems in transporting this membrane lipid to the cell\nmembrane. Our microarray experiments provided evidence that\nthe target pathway of azoles is not affected transcriptionally in the\npresence or the absence of FCZ (Figure S3A, Tables S5 and S6).\nWe further found that the amount of ergosterol is similar in the\nplasma membrane of age3 mutants compared to WT (our\nFigure 8. age3 mutants are attenuated in virulence in A\/J mice\nand FCZ treatment significantly extends survival of age3-\ninfected A\/J mice. (A) age3 mutant-infected mice survive significantly\nlonger with a median survival of two days versus one day for WT and\nrevertant-infected mice. Six mice were used per experimental group. (B)\nFungal kidney burden was examined from moribund mice and was\nsignificantly higher in age3 mutant recovered cells compared to WT or\nrevertant control groups. (C) A short FCZ therapy (4.5 mg\/kg\nintraperitoneally once immediately after fungal infection, once on day\none and once on day two post fungal infection) is significantly more\nefficacious when ARF cycling is genetically compromised as only the\nmajority (83%) of mutant-infected mice survive until the end of the\nexperiment (day 21). Six mice were used for WT and revertant groups\nand 12 mice for the age3 mutant group.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.g008\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nunpublished data). These findings together with epistasis experi-\nments showing that deletion of AGE3 restored azole sensitivity in\ndifferent clinical isolates, suggest that the azole sensitivity of age3\ncells is unlikely to depend on established mechanisms.\nFinally, in support of the vesicle transport hypothesis is the\nobservation that while age3 cells showed slightly increased\nsensitivity to different cell wall perturbing agents (CF and\ncalcofluor white), the most impressive effect besides azoles was\nobserved when age3 cells were treated with hygromycin B\n(Figure 1D). Hygromycin B sensitivity is usually linked to\nglycosylation defects [31,32]. Therefore, it remains possible that\nsome glycosylated proteins, including GPI-anchored proteins that\nnormally reside in the cell wall, are not properly localized in age3\ncells. How precisely defects in vesicle trafficking influence the\nobserved drug phenotypes and whether drug sensitivity is caused\nby a general aspect of the secretory pathway or of a particular cell\nmembrane or wall protein remains to be determined.\nDrug resistance and virulence are two important biological\naspects of pathogenic fungal species. While different fungal drug\nresistance mechanisms are now well understood [69,70], various\nvirulence-related attributes have been described that help Candida\nto cause infections [57,59,71]. Whereas genes critically involved\neither in drug resistance or virulence are attractive drug targets\n[59], an undeniably better option is targeting genes that are\ninvolved in both processes. The broad-range sensitivity to azoles\nand an echinocandin together with in vivo data showing that age3\nmutants are avirulent in WT and exhibit significantly attenuated\nvirulence even in an immunocompromised mouse model, indicates\nthat Age3p and the process of ARF cycling is one such option. We\nfurther explored the therapeutic potential of ARF cycling\ninhibition by demonstrating that, in A\/J mice, FCZ treatment\nwas significantly more efficacious when ARF activity was\ngenetically compromised.\nOne of our major problems was to reproduce the potent in vitro\nsynergy of FCZ\/BFA in animal models as we observed that a\nFCZ\/BFA combination failed to rescue A\/J mice infected with\nWT C. albicans (data not shown). One reason why the in vitro\nsynergy failed to translate to in vivo conditions could be that BFA\nhas low bioavailability characteristics [72] and efforts to chemically\nimprove these unfavorable properties have not been successful so\nfar [73,74]. The ability of BFA to induce apoptosis in cancer cells\nhas stimulated an interest for developing BFA as an anti-cancer\ntherapeutic agent [75,76,77,78,79,80]. Increasing evidence also\nshows that a variety of small G protein signaling pathways of the\nRas superfamily, like RHO, RAS and ARF, have been linked to\ntumorigenesis [81,82,83]. Thus, despite being evolutionarily\nconserved, targeting ARF activities could be beneficial not only\nfor antifungal, but also for cancer therapies. Clearly, one future\nchallenge lies in finding fungal-specific ARF activity inhibitors that\nretain favorable bioavailability in vivo, a challenge that can now be\napproached cost- and time-effectively through virtual screening\nwith both mammalian and yeast crystal structures of different ARF\ncycling proteins at hand [43,44,45,46,47,48,84,85].\nThe age3 mutant lost tolerance to FCZ (Figure 1). This\nphenomenon of losing tolerance under membrane stress is not\nunique to ARF cycling. Previous work established that when\nHSP90 or calcineurin is genetically or pharmacologically inhibited\nin different fungal species, cells show a similar loss of tolerance and\nare not able to survive membrane stress [17,18,22,86]. Additional\nphenotypes that calcineurin inhibition shares with ARF inhibition\ninclude synergism with azoles and echinocandins as well as\nreduced virulence in the bloodstream of the host [17,19,87]. These\noverlapping phenotypes, together with our epistasis experiments\nthat showed that deleting AGE3 overrides constitutive calcineurin\nsignaling, provide some arguments that ARF cycling and HSP90\/\ncalcineurin-dependent processes could be coupled. Although\noverlapping functions cannot be excluded, several lines of evidence\nsupport the current model that ARF and HSP90\/calcineurin\ninhibition constitute two distinct mechanisms contributing to drug\ntolerance. First, a triple combination of azole\/calcineurin\/ARF\ninhibition is more efficacious than either pairwise combination at\n24 hours. Second, consistent with previous observations that long\nterm azole resistance evolves towards HSP90\/calcineurin-inde-\npendency [20], cells treated with calcineurin inhibitors plus FCZ\nrecover after prolonged incubation, while BFA\/FCZ treated cells\ndo not. Finally, if ARF cycling is in fact coupled to HSP90\/\ncalcineurin signaling, then we might expect age3 mutants to copy\nother HSP90\/calcineurin phenotypes besides the demonstrated\nreduced virulence and drug sensitivity. One explanation, for\ninstance, why calcineurin mutants are avirulent is that they do not\nsurvive in the presence of FBS or Ca2+ ions present in host serum\n[19,88]. We found, however, that age3 mutants can survive FBS\nand Ca2+ stresses (data not shown).\nMore work is therefore required to elucidate how ARF G\nprotein signaling relates to HSP90\/calcineurin and other signaling\npathways that share ARF-related phenotypes. With four ARF\nproteins, six ARF GAPs and seven ARF GEFs identified in yeast\nso far [89], this provides a rich resource for further investigations\ninto which aspects of vesicle transport and ARF G protein\nsignaling are responsible for two important aspects of the biology\nof pathogenic fungal species.\nMaterials and Methods\nStrains, plasmids, primers and culture conditions\nAll strains, primers and plasmids used in this study are described\nin supplementary Table S9, S10 and S11, respectively. C. albicans\nmutants were constructed either with the UAU1-transposon\ninsertion strategy [90] or by deleting the coding sequence of\ngenes (Table S9). For insertion and deletion mutant construction,\nat least two mutants independently derived from two distinct\nheterozygous mutants were analyzed in each case. With regards to\nthe AEG3 gene (ORF19.3683), we propose to use AGE3 as standard\nname for the C. albicans homolog of S. cerevisiae\u2019s GCS1, because\nanother gene (ORF19.5059) has already been named \u2018GCS1\u2019 in the\nCandida literature [91]. For the AGE3 deletion mutant, long 100-\nmer primers flanking up- and downstream sequences, respectively,\nof the coding sequence of AGE3 were used to amplify marker\ncassettes pFA-HIS1 and pFA-ARG4 [92]. Transformation was\ncarried out according to standard protocols [93] and selected on\nsynthetic media (2% dextrose, 6.7% yeast nitrogen base without\namino acids, 2% agar) containing the necessary auxotrophic\nsupplements. Correct marker integration was PCR-verified as\ndescribed [94]. As genetic manipulation in C. albicans can\nfrequently lead to aneuploidy [95,96], we verified the absence of\nany chromosomal rearrangements by Comparative Genome\nHybridization (CGH) and found that deletion mutants of AGE3\nwere aneuploidy free (Figure S4). For constructing the AGE3-\nrevertant strain, the SAT1 flipper cassette was used [97]. Briefly,\nthe AGE3 coding sequence including upstream and a short\ndownstream flanking sequence was amplified with primers\noEE242\/oEE243, KpnI\/XhoI-digested and cloned into the KpnI\/\nXhoI-digested pSFS2A plasmid, resulting in plasmid pCaEE25,\nwhich was sequenced. A long downstream flanking sequence of\nAGE3 was amplified with primers oEE237\/oEE238, NotI\/SacII-\ndigested and then cloned into the NotI\/SacII-digested plasmid\npCaEE25, resulting in plasmid pCaEE27. Following KpnI\/SacII\ndouble digestion of plasmid pCaEE27, this digestion was\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\ntransformed directly into the age3 deletion strain. Selection was\ndone on YPD plates containing 200 mg\/ml nourseothricin, as\ndescribed [67] and PCR-verified. Counterselection of the\nnourseothricin marker was done as described [67].\nThe nourseothricin marker cassette [97] was also used to delete\nAGE3 in FCZ-resistant strains F5, S2 and DSY2146. Briefly, a\nlong upstream coding sequence of AGE3 was first amplified from\npEE27 with primers oEE235\/oEE236, Kpn1\/Xho1 digested and\nthen cloned into the Kpn1\/Xho1 digested plasmid pEE27, therefore\nreplacing the coding sequence of AGE3. The resulting plasmid was\ndesignated pEE43.\nCandida strains were routinely cultured at 30uC in either rich\nYPD media (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose,\nsupplemented with 50 mg\/ml uridine) or RPMI-MOPS media\n(RPMI-1640, SIGMA, supplemented with 0.3 g\/l L-glutamine,\n50 mg\/ml uridine, 2% glucose, pH adjusted with MOPS buffer to\n7.0). Media plates were supplemented with 2% agar. A. fumigatus\nwas cultured in half-strength YPD media (not enriched with\nuridine) or RPMI-MOPS media (not enriched with uridine).\nMedia plates were supplemented with 1.5% agar.\nAntifungal susceptibility testing\nBecause drug susceptibility results did not differ significantly\nbetween WT C. albicans strains SC5314 (isolate) and SN95 (a\nstandard laboratory auxotrophic mutant used to construct deletion\nmutants) [98] (Table S2), WT usually refers to SN95 unless\nindicated otherwise. Drug stock solutions were prepared using\nethanol\/10% Tween 20 as solvent for FK506 (5 mg\/ml),\ncyclosporin A (25 mg\/ml), DMSO for fluconazole (300 mg\/ml),\nmiconazole (100 mg\/ml), ketoconazole (16.6 mg\/ml), itracona-\nzole (10 mg\/ml), amphotericin B (20 mg\/ml), calcofluor white\n(50 mg\/ml), brefeldin A (20 mM), hygromycin B (50 mg\/ml), and\nwater for caspofungin (10 mg\/ml). All drugs were obtained from\nSigma, except caspofungin (Merck), fluconazole and itraconazole\n(both from SpectrumChemical, Mfg Corp, USA). Once in\nsolution, drugs were stored at 220uC. Initial antifungal sensitivity\ntesting with all C. albicans FCZ-cidal candidates was done using a\nmodified version of the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) procedure [99].\nBriefly, 50 ml of drugs at two-fold the final concentration was\nserially diluted in flat-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning\nInc., NY, USA) and combined with 50 ml of overnight Candida\ncultures adjusted to 16104 cells\/ml. MIC plates were incubated at\n30uC without shaking and optical densities were read at indicated\ntime points with a Tecan Safire plate reader. The MIC was\ndetermined by the first well with a growth reduction of .95% in\nterms of OD600 values in the presence of a compound compared to\nuntreated control cells. Before the 72 hours OD600 readings, plates\nwere carefully shaken, so that a representative aliquot of 2 ml of\neach well could be spotted on fresh YPD recovery plates to assess\nthe extent to which cells recover from the drug treatments.\nRecovery plates were incubated at 30uC between 24 hours and\n48 hours before being photographed. Drug susceptibilities of\nrobust hits that resulted from this initial MIC testing were then\nconfirmed on solid media plates containing FCZ, disc diffusion or\ntime-kill curve assays, as described [19].\nDose-matrix titration assays were used to evaluate drug\nsynergies. Briefly, dose-matrix titration assays were done as\ndescribed for the MIC assays, except that the final volume was\n150 ml; 50 ml of three-fold the final drug concentration of drug A\nwas dispensed in two-fold serial dilution steps across seven columns\nof the plate, 50 ml of three-fold the final drug concentration of\ndrug B was dispensed in two-fold serial dilution steps down seven\nrows of the plate; 50 ml of overnight Candida cultures adjusted to\n1.56104 cells\/ml was dispensed in all drug containing wells plus\none control well containing no drugs. Synergy of a compound pair\nwas quantified with respect to the Loewe additivity model [100]\nvia the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC index) =\n(MICA in combo\/MICA alone) + (MICB in combo\/MICB alone), where\n\u2018\u2018MICA in combo\u2019\u2019 is the MIC of drug A in combination,\n\u2018\u2018MICA alone\u2019\u2019 is the MIC of drug A alone, \u2018\u2018MICB in combo\u2019\u2019 is\nthe MIC of drug B in combination and \u2018\u2018MICB alone\u2019\u2019 is the MIC of\ndrug B alone, respectively. Compound pairs were classified as\nsynergistic if its FIC index is #0.5, the standard threshold\n[100,101]. For calculation purposes of the FIC index, MIC values\nof .1, .2, .8, .16, .64, .128, .2048, .4096 were assumed\nto be 2, 4, 16, 32, 128, 256, 4096, 8192, respectively. MIC and\ndose-matrix titration results were visualized with TreeView version\n1.6 (http:\/\/rana.lbl.gov\/EisenSoftware.htm).\nA. fumigatus disc diffusion assays were done as described [16],\nwith the following modifications. Conidiation was induced on\nYPD plates incubated at 37uC for seven days. Conidia were then\nwashed off the plates and suspended in PBS+0.1% Tween media\nbefore spreading 16105 conidia on appropriate plates. Discs\ncontaining 6.4 mg caspofungin were applied and the plates were\nincubated at 35uC for 48 hours. A. fumigatus MIC assays were done\nexactly as described [102]. All MIC and dose-matrix titration\nassays with Candida and Aspergillus were independently performed\non at least two different occasions.\nVirulence studies\nVirulence testing of C. albicans was done as previously described\n[58]. Briefly, 8- to 12-week old C57BL\/6J or A\/J mice (Jackson\nLaboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were inoculated via the tail vein\nwith 200 ml of a suspension containing 36105 C. albicans in PBS.\nMice were closely monitored over a period of maximally 21 days\nfor clinical signs of disease such as lethargy, ruffled fur, or hunched\nback. Mice showing extreme lethargy were considered moribund\nand were euthanized. All experimental procedures involving\nanimals were approved by the Biotechnology Research Institute\nAnimal Care Committee, which operates under the guidelines of\nthe Canadian Council of Animal Care. Statistical analysis of\nsurvival curves as well as fungal load was done with GraphPad\nPrism version 5.0b. For kidney sections, extracted organs were\nfixed in 10% formaldehyde (Sigma) and processed at the Histology\nCore Facility at McGill (http:\/\/cancercentre.mcgill.ca\/) by\nstaining thin slices of tissue sections with Grocot\u2013Gomori\nmethenamine silver to visualize fungal cells.\nMicroarray and CGH studies\nComparative Genome Hybridization (CGH) analysis was done\nas previously described [49] with the following modifications.\nGenomic DNA was extracted from a C. albicans culture grown to\nsaturation with the Qiagen Genomic DNA Extraction kit\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA hybridization\nwas done with the Advalytix SlideBooster for 16 hours at 42uC\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nFor the fluconazole microarray experiment, overnight cultures\nof C. albicans cells were diluted to OD600 of 0.05 in fresh YPD\nmedia, grown to early logarithmic phase (OD600 0.8) and split into\ntwo 50 ml cultures in 250 ml Erlenmayer flasks. One culture was\nfluconazole treated (600 mg\/ml), while the other group received\nan equal amount of DMSO as control. Cultures were grown for\none hour, spun down, the supernatant was removed and the cell\npellet was nitrogen-flash frozen and stored at 280uC until further\nuse. RNA was extracted according to the hot-phenol protocol\n[103]. For the caspofungin microarray experiment, logarithmically\ngrowing cells were treated with 125 ng\/ml caspofungin for one\nhour, as previously described [52]. RNA was extracted with the\nARF Cycling, Fungal Drug Resistance and Virulence\nPLoS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 February 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 2 | e1000753\nRNase easy kit (Qiagen), as described [67]. Probe labeling,\nhybridization and slide washing was done as described [104],\nexcept that the SlideBooster was used for hybridization. At least\nthree biological replicates including dye swaps were used for each\ncondition on double spotted ORF microarrays (6,394 intragenic\n70-mer oligonucleotide probes) [104]. Scanning was done with a\nScanArray Lite microarray scanner (Perkin Elmer). QuantArray\nwas used to quantify fluorescence intensities and data analysis was\ncarried out using Genespring v.7.3 (Agilent Technologies). To\ncompare overlap of different gene lists as well as analyzing Gene\nOntology enrichment, p-values were calculated using the hyper-\ngeometric distribution as described in the GO Term Finder\nTool web site (http:\/\/www.candidagenome.org\/cgi-bin\/GO\/\ngoTermFinder). Gene lists can be found in Tables S4, S5, S6,\nS7 and S8.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Phenotypes of the predicted FCZ-cidal genes in C.\nalbicans as determined on rich media containing FCZ. Five-fold\nserial dilutions starting with an overnight culture diluted to OD600\nof 0.1 was spotted (2 ml) on YPD or YPD + 2 mg\/ml FCZ. Plates\nwere incubated at 30uC for the time indicated.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s001 (5.05 MB TIF)\nFigure S2 BFA synergy with different azoles in synthetically\ndefined RPMI media at 30uC. (A) Prior to synergy testing, C.\nalbicans WT strain was tested for drug sensitivity, which was\nmeasured over time on day one (24 hours), day three (72 hours)\nand day six (144 hours), respectively. Data was analyzed as in\nFigure 1A. (B) Optical densities of dose-matrix titration assays\nwere measured on day three (72 hours) or day six (144 hours),\nrespectively. Additionally, spot assays were done on day six.\nExcept for media, assays were performed and analyzed as in\nFigure 1A and 3B.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s002 (2.15 MB TIF)\nFigure S3 Core transcriptional responses to FCZ or CF are not\nsignificantly affected in the absence of AGE3. (A) Transcriptional\nanalysis under FCZ treatment. Significantly regulated genes (.2\nfold change, p-value ,0.05) were selected when WT was treated\nwith FCZ (WT+FCZ vs. WT) and combined with significantly\nregulated genes when age3 cells were FCZ treated (age3+FCZ vs.\nage3) to build a cluster tree (top). The same gene list was used to\nvisualize in the Venn diagram (bottom) a significant overlap of core\nFCZ-responsive genes. (B) Transcriptional analysis under CF\ntreatment. Gene lists were selected in the same way as described\nfor the FCZ treatment to build a cluster tree. The Venn diagram\nillustrates that there is a significant overlap of core CF responsive\ngenes. Tables S4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 list exact transcript changes for\nall significantly regulated genes used in the FCZ and CF analysis.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s003 (0.89 MB TIF)\nFigure S4 No aneuploidies were detected in the AGE3 deletion\nmutant by CGH analysis. Cy3 labeled genomic DNA from either\nage3 mutants or strain BWP17 was hybridized to DNA\nmicroarrays with Cy5 labeled genomic DNA from the reference\nstrain SC5314. Shown are plots of CGH (comparative genome\nhybridization) analyses, where the y-axis shows the log2 fluores-\ncence ratio of the mutant strains versus SC5314 and the x-axis\nshows all chromosomes (1 to R). A single black rhombus represents\nthe log2 fluorescence ratio plotted as a function of its position in\nthe C. albicans\u2019 assembly 21. In this representation, a 1.5-fold\nincrease in fluorescence ratio (i.e. 3 chromosome copies versus 2)\nequals a log2 ratio of,0.58. (A) CGH shows the known loss of one\nend of chromosome 5 in strain BWP17. This strain is also\nauxotroph for URA3, HIS1, ARG4. (B) The prototrophic age3\nmutant does not have any chromosomal rearrangements as\ndetermined by CGH.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s004 (7.62 MB TIF)\nTable S1 The 22 FCZ-cidal genes in S. cerevisiae and the C.\nalbicans homologs.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s005 (0.04 MB XLS)\nTable S2 Phenotypes of the predicted FCZ-cidal genes in C.\nalbicans as determined by MIC assay in YPD media.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s006 (0.04 MB XLS)\nTable S3 Drug synergy interaction as determined by FIC index.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s007 (0.04 MB XLS)\nTable S4 The genes listed here were significantly regulated (.2\nfold, p-value ,0.05) in absence of AGE3.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s008 (0.04 MB XLS)\nTable S5 Fluconazole (FCZ) responsive genes as identified by\nmicroarray analysis.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s009 (0.07 MB XLS)\nTable S6 This list contains the same genes as Table S5, but the\ngenes are colored here according to the Venn Diagram in Figure\nS3A (bottom).\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s010 (0.07 MB XLS)\nTable S7 Caspofungin (CF) responsive genes as identified by\nmicroarray analysis.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s011 (0.13 MB XLS)\nTable S8 This list contains the same genes as Table S7, but the\ngenes are colored here according to the Venn Diagram in Figure\nS3B (bottom).\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s012 (0.13 MB XLS)\nTable S9 Strains used in this study.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s013 (0.04 MB XLS)\nTable S10 Primers used in this study.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s014 (0.05 MB XLS)\nTable S11 Plasmids used in this study.\nFound at: doi:10.1371\/journal.ppat.1000753.s015 (0.03 MB XLS)\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Robert Annan for critical reading of the manuscript.
