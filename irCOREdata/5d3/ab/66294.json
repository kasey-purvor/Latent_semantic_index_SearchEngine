There is a consensus amongst petrologists that several conditions must be met \nto generate boninitic magma. First, the magnesium- and silica-rich nature of the melts \nand very low absolute concentrations of some trace elements (e.g. Nb, Ta, Ti) and \nheavy rare earth elements requires low pressure melting of residual (harzburgitic) \nperidotite, such as may be found in oceanic mantle lithosphere overriding a subducted \nslab. Second, because this residual source had previously lost a basaltic melt fraction \nan abnormally high heat flux is required to promote melting [Falloon and \nDanyushevsky, 2000]. Third, boninite series lavas display enrichment of the large ion \nlithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) relative to high \nfield strength elements (HFSEs).  High LILE\/HFSE ratios are widely regarded as \nindicating a (hydrous) fluid flux from subducted oceanic lithosphere into the depleted \nperidotite [Crawford et al., 1989; Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Stern et al., 1991; Pearce et \nal., 1992]. The presence of such a fluid in the source will also contribute to lowering \nthe solidus temperature of the residual peridotite. Finally, a mechanism is required to \nexplain the elevation of Zr\/Sm, Hf\/Sm and Zr\/Ti ratios in boninites compared to other \ntypes of lavas. The most common explanations of this feature have involved sources \nrelated to ocean island basalt (OIB) magmatism [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Stern et al., \n1991; Hickey-Vargas and Reagan, 1987], or partial melting of the subducted oceanic \ncrust in the amphibolite field [Pearce et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 1994]. New Hf isotope \nevidence appears to rule out the slab-melting hypothesis in boninites from the western \nPacific and favours melting of mafic components stored in the shallow mantle or \nlower crust of the overriding plate [Pearce et al., 1999]. \nBoninitic rocks are found in two main settings.  Several convergent margins contain \nboninitic lavas and these have been used to provide the primary evidence for the \ntectonic setting in which this style of magmatism occurs.  The best studied locations \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 4 \nof Cenozoic boninite lavas are the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc, Cape Vogel in Papua \nNew Guinea, the Northern Tonga arc and the Setouchi Volcanic belt of Japan \n[Crawford et al., 1989 and references therein; Falloon and Danyushevsky, 2000].  A \nnumber of Phanerozoic ophiolite sequences also contain boninitic rocks, most notably \nthe Cretaceous Troodos ophiolite in Cyprus [Cameron, 1985] and the Cenozoic \nZambales ophiolite of the Philippines [Encarnaci\u00f3n et al., 1999].  Boninites are absent \nin many arcs and where they do occur a notable feature is their limited volume \ncompared to contemporaneous magmatism, principally in the form of island arc \ntholeiites [Crawford et al., 1989].  Boninites are volumetrically subordinate to \ntholeiitic lavas in Papua New Guinea [Jenner, 1981] and in both the Troodos and \nZambales ophiolites [Cameron, 1985, Encarnaci\u00f3n et al., 1999].  Where volume \nestimates have not been made boninites still apparently form rare or spatially \nrestricted amounts of the total igneous assemblage e.g. Setouchi belt [Tatsumi and \nMaruyama, 1989], New Caledonia [Cameron, 1989] and the northern Tonga Trench \n[Falloon and Danyushevsky, 2000].  In stark contrast to this are the Middle Eocene \nboninitic lavas that comprise a significant fraction of basement throughout the Izu-\nBonin and Mariana forearcs [Crawford et al., 1989; Pearce et al., 1992; Taylor et al., \n1994; Bloomer et al., 1995]. This magmatic suite, which will be collectively referred \nto as the IBM boninite suite, requires that conditions conducive to boninite genesis \noccurred over a large area (2000km long by 300km wide) in a relatively short interval \n[Taylor, 1992] in the Eocene.  Indeed, recent 40Ar-39Ar dating suggests that the \nboninite magmatism was initiated almost simultaneously throughout this area in the \nearly part of the Middle Eocene and was, for the most part, a very short-lived event \n[Cosca et al., 1998]. \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 5 \nRecent hypotheses for generation of the IBM boninite suite have favoured models in \nwhich a high geothermal gradient was achieved through the combination of two \neffects. These are that (1) very young, and hence hot, oceanic lithosphere, or even a \nspreading centre, was subducted beneath (2) young, hot lithosphere of the Philippine \nSea Plate [Crawford et al., 1989; Pearce et al., 1992, Taylor et al., 1994]. The \ncombination would generate an abnormally high heat flux in the subduction zone thus \npermitting melting of both the residual harzburgitic lithosphere in the overriding plate \nand the subducted slab. However, there are geodynamic problems with such a tectonic \narrangement. First, the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc basement is composed largely of \nthe IBM boninite suite and associated tholeiites with only localised evidence for pre-\nEocene magmatic activity (e.g. DSDP Site 458 [Hickey-Vargas, 1989]). This implies \nthat subduction was initiated close to, and almost parallel to, a spreading centre over a \ndistance of approximately 2000km and that very young, buoyant crust was the first \ncrust to enter the trench over its entire length. Comparison with other sites of known \nridge-subduction zone collision suggests this is extremely unlikely. Attempted ridge \nsubduction west of the Antarctic Peninsula led to a cessation of subduction [Hole et \nal., 1995] and widespread boninitic magmatism is not recognised either here or in \nlocations such as northern Cascadia where subduction of very young oceanic \nlithosphere has been successful [Green and Harry, 1999]. Second, new Hf isotope \nevidence indicates that slab melting played a negligible role in the genesis of the IBM \nboninites [Pearce et al., 1999]. This finding removes one of the principal geochemical \nrequirements for subduction of a young slab. Third, although a young, hot overriding \nplate can be reconciled with models for the early Cenozoic tectonics of the region this \ncannot explain the evolution of geochemistry in lavas from the backarc region of the \noverriding plate.  Pre-Eocene magmatism produced trace element-depleted I-MORB \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 6 \nbut this was succeeded by trace element-enriched and isotopically distinct magmatism \nduring the Middle Eocene, followed by a reversion to I-MORB geochemistry (see \nbelow). \nWhile their association with the onset of widespread subduction in the Izu-Bonin-\nMariana arc is well established [Bloomer et al., 1995], boninites have not been \nidentified in more recently initiated subduction zones of similar dimensions such as \nthe Bicol arc in the eastern Philippines [Divis, 1980] or the Sunda and Banda arcs in \neastern Indonesia [Wheller et al., 1987]. There are probably several tectonic scenarios \nthat can achieve the combination of heating and hydrous fluxing of harzburgite that \nare required for boninite magmatism as is reflected in the presence of boninitic rocks \nin a number of subduction zones and supra-subduction zone ophiolites. However, the \nexceptional volume of boninitic lavas erupted in the Middle Eocene IBM, compared \nto other Cenozoic arcs and Phanerozoic supra-subduction zone ophiolites, suggests \nthat unusual thermal, chemical and\/or tectonic conditions may have prevailed at that \ntime. In order to identify the conditions that generated the IBM suite it is necessary to \nunderstand the Middle Eocene tectonics of the western Pacific. \nMiddle Eocene tectonics of the equatorial western Pacific \nBoninites of the IBM suite were erupted at the present eastern margin of the \nPhilippine Sea Plate during the Middle Eocene [Bloomer et al., 1995; Taylor, 1992; \nCosca et al., 1998; DeBari et al., 1999]. The geographic locations of relevant tectonic \nelements are highlighted in Figure 1, and Figure 2 shows a reconstruction of the area \nat 50 Ma after Hall [Hall, 1996]. \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 7 \nPre-Middle Eocene Philippine Sea Plate \nFragments of oceanic crust dredged from the inner trench wall of the Izu-Bonin \nTrench bear a distinctive Indian Ocean (I-)MORB isotopic signature [DeBari et al., \n1999]. The age of these crustal fragments is unknown but is probably similar to or \ngreater than Late Cretaceous ages determined radiometrically for rocks dredged from \nthe Amami-Oki Daito Province, which forms the northern part of the Philippine Sea \nPlate ([Shiki et al., 1985]; Fig. 1). This suggests that prior to the Middle Eocene the \nPhilippine Sea Plate was comprised of the Amami-Oki Daito Province, which is \nprobably of arc origin [Taylor, 1992; Shiki et al., 1985; Mills, 1980], and some \noceanic crust generated in the I-MORB domain. \nMiddle Eocene spreading in the West Philippine Basin \nThe West Philippine Basin forms the largest tract of the Philippine Sea Plate and is \nbounded by the Philippine Trench to the west, the Ryukyu Trough to the northwest, \nand the Palau-Kyushu Ridge to the east (Fig. 1). It comprises three main sections; a \nnorthwestern sub-basin, the main or northern sub-basin and a southern sub-basin \n[Mrozowski et al., 1982]. The northern sub-basin can be further divided into the \nAmami-Oki Daito province in the north and the deeper central portion containing the \nNW-SE striking Central Basin Fault. The Central Basin Fault represents an extinct \nocean ridge system that facilitated separation of the Amami-Oki Daito province and \nthe undated southern sub-basin by seafloor spreading [Mrozowski et al., 1982; Lewis \net al., 1982; Hilde and Lee, 1984]. \nMrozowski [Mrozowski et al., 1982] identified paired magnetic anomalies 20-17 \ntrending NW-SE in the central part of the basin giving a minimum age of 46 Ma for \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 8 \nthe initiation of spreading at the Central Basin Fault. Hilde and Lee [Hilde and Lee, \n1984] interpreted magnetic anomalies extending through the Amami-Oki Daito \nprovince as indicating spreading from about 60 Ma. However, Okino [Okino et al., \n1999] have suggested that the seafloor immediately south of the Amami-Oki Daito \nProvince may preserve a different, N-S spreading fabric. Radiometric ages of 49 Ma \nand 19 Ma have been obtained by 40Ar-39Ar dating of magmatic rocks from DSDP \nSite 294, which sampled basement immediately south of the Oki Daito Ridge (Fig. 1; \n[Ozima et al., 1977; Hickey-Vargas, 1998]). Excess argon may have confounded the \nlatter determinations [Hickey-Vargas, 1998] since the older age is similar to that of \nnearby magnetic anomalies and the age inferred for the sedimentary cover drilled at \nSite 294. Furthermore, the older age is in closer accord with Middle Eocene ages (c. \n45 Ma) determined for basement at DSDP Site 291 on the opposite margin of the \nbasin ([Hickey-Vargas, 1998]; Fig. 1). The radiometric ages and their overlying \nsediments indicate that the onset of spreading in the central West Philippine Basin \nbegan in the latest part of the Early Eocene or the earliest Middle Eocene. \nThe oceanic crust of the southern sub-basin is distinct from the central part of the \nWest Philippine Basin. Acoustic basement in the southern sub-basin is smoother and \nis at shallower depth below sea-level than the crust closer to the Central Basin Fault, \nsuggesting greater crustal thickness [Mrozowski et al., 1982; Okino et al., 1999]. \nThicker, smoother crust devoid of fracture zones is a characteristic found in many \nparts of the North Atlantic close to Iceland, which White [White, 1997] attributed to \nhigher melt fluxes and slower cooling rates as a result of higher mantle potential \ntemperature. The differences in crustal structure suggest the initial, Middle Eocene, \nphase of opening in the West Philippine Basin involved more voluminous melt \ngeneration than during subsequent spreading, possibly as a result of hotter mantle and \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 9 \nhigher heat-flow. The initial oceanic crust may also have formed with a higher \nspreading rate [Mrozowski et al., 1982; Okino et al., 1999]. \nNon-boninitic Middle Eocene magmatism \nThe IBM boninite suite was not the only magmatic event to affect the Philippine Sea \nPlate during the Middle Eocene.  Magmatism also occurred in the newly forming \nWest Philippine Basin and in the Amami-Oki Daito province on the northern margin \nof the rift (Fig. 1 and 2). Rifting was responsible for the opening of the West \nPhilippine Basin but the range of trace element and isotopic compositions \ncharacterising magmatism in these two areas can not be reconciled solely with \ndecompression melting of depleted upper mantle. \nPre-Middle Eocene lavas from the West Philippine Basin that are depleted in the most \nincompatible elements have Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios that resemble I-MORB \n[DeBari et al., 1999] while Middle Eocene lavas tend to be incompatible element-\nenriched and show isotopic evidence for the presence of an additional component \nsimilar to EM-2 [Hickey-Vargas, 1998]. This latter signal is strong in the igneous \nbasement of DSDP Sites 291, 292 and 294 on the southern- and northern-most edges \nof the West Philippine Basin (Fig. 1). These sites represent the first crust that formed \nduring Middle Eocene spreading. Incompatible element-enriched sills with EM-2 \nisotopic ratios were also emplaced into early Middle Eocene sediments in the Daito \nBasin (at DSDP Site 446; [Hickey-Vargas, 1998]) and have yielded early-Middle \nEocene radiometric ages [Hickey-Vargas, 1998; McKee and Klock, 1980] suggesting \nthis source was available throughout the newly forming rift. Further north, Middle \nEocene conglomerates from DSDP Site 445 (Fig. 1) commonly contain fragments of \nalkali basalt with titanaugite phenocrysts [Mills, 1980; Tokuyama et al., 1980] and \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 10 \npotassic trachyandesite dated as 48.5 \u00b1 2 Ma has been dredged from the Amami \nPlateau [Matsuda et al., 1975]. Hickey-Vargas [Hickey-Vargas, 1998] refers to lavas \ndisplaying trace element enrichment and EM-2 isotopic affinity collectively as \nPhilippine Sea Plate OIB (PSP-OIB).  Drilling and dredging throughout the northern \npart of the West Philippine Basin suggest that alkaline magmatic activity was \nrelatively widespread during the Middle Eocene.  Furthermore, all analyses conducted \nthus far for alkaline and tholeiitic lavas with reliable radiometric or stratigraphic age \ncontrols indicate that this part of the basin was characterised by magmatism with EM-\n2 ocean island basalt geochemistry [Hickey-Vargas, 1998]. \nIn contrast to PSP-OIB, Philippine Sea Plate crust created prior to the opening of the \nWest Philippine Basin resembles I-MORB [DeBari et al., 1999]. Similarly, the \nyoungest drilled and dredged sections of the West Philippine Basin at DSPD Site 447 \nand the Central Basin Fault possess I-MORB trace element and isotopic signatures \n[Pearce et al., 1999, Hickey-Vargas, 1991]. Furthermore, the spreading rate in the \nmain part of the basin may have decreased in the latter part of the Middle Eocene \n[Mrozowski et al., 1982; Hilde and Lee, 1984; Okino et al., 1999]. Therefore, an \nisotopically distinct source that yielded lavas with large enrichments of incompatible \ntrace elements and an EM-2 isotopic signature appears to have been introduced into \nthe mantle beneath the West Philippine Basin at, or immediately before, the time that \nseafloor spreading began. Towards the end of the Middle Eocene magmatism forming \nthe central portion of the West Philippine Basin closely resembled I-MORB again \n[Pearce et al., 1999; Hickey-Vargas, 1991]. Suitable samples are not available to test \nfor the presence of similar magmatism in the southern sub-basin of the West \nPhilippine Basin but its morphological similarities suggests that it may be a \ncomplementary margin to the Amami-Oki-Daito province (see above). \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 11 \nMiddle Eocene uplift in the West Philippine Basin \nSeveral authors have suggested that the Early Eocene or earliest Middle Eocene saw a \nperiod of uplift affecting the Amami-Oki Daito Province. A lack of in situ shallow \nwater fossils in Upper Cretaceous to Lower Eocene sediments of the Amami-Oki \nDaito province correlates with a transgression of Pacific reefs [Mills, 1980]. However, \nNummulites boninensis is a common constituent of the Middle Eocene sections of \nDSDP\/ODP holes and dredge hauls throughout the Amami-Oki Daito province \nsuggesting proximity to a shallow sea environment at this time [Shiki et al., 1985; \nMills, 1980; Tokuyama et al., 1980; Tokuyama et al., 1985]. An increased abundance \nof chlorite, serpentine and quartz in Middle Eocene sediments, relative to smectite-\ndominated Lower Eocene beds, led Chamley [Chamley, 1980] to propose either a \ndecrease in volcanic activity or regional uplift of this area at the beginning of the \nMiddle Eocene. The presence of Middle Eocene conglomerates and coarse grains and \nclasts in other contemporaneous deposits of DSDP Site 445, along with the exposure \nof Cretaceous rocks throughout the Amami-Oki Daito province, are more consistent \nwith significant uplift [Chamley, 1980; Misawa et al., 1985]. Furthermore, schist \nclasts in the Daito Ridge conglomerates preserve evidence of two metamorphic \nevents. Radiometric dating identified an intermediate- to high-pressure regional event \nduring the Late Cretaceous while low-pressure contact metamorphism occurred at 49 \n\u00b1 4 Ma [Tokuyama et al., 1980]. The inclusion of clasts of the younger event in \nMiddle Eocene conglomerates indicates significant erosion, probably as a result of \nrapid uplift, at this time. Finally, Misawa et al. [Misawa et al., 1985] suggested that an \nunconformity observed between the (Cretaceous) basement and the overlying \nNummulites-bearing strata on seismic lines throughout the Amami-Oki Daito province \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 12 \nresulted from uplift of the region at some time during the Early Eocene or the earliest \npart of the Middle Eocene. \nSubaerial exposure that affected parts of the Amami-Oki Daito province was \nrelatively short-lived and was succeeded by the regional development of shallow \nmarine, Nummulites-bearing beds [Mills, 1980, Tokuyama et al., 1980, Misawa et al., \n1985]. Conglomerates are coarsest at the base of the Middle Eocene section but are \nreplaced up-section by sandstones and mudstones [Tokuyama et al., 1980] and the \nprovenance of Upper Eocene sediments in this area is wholly marine [Chamley, \n1980]. These observations suggest relatively rapid elevation occurred in the Amami-\nOki Daito province, bringing localised areas above sea level, between the end of the \nCretaceous and the Middle Eocene which was quickly succeeded by subsidence to \nshallow marine depths [Mills, 1980; Tokuyama et al., 1980; Chamley, 1980; Misawa \net al., 1985]. \nDiscussion \nThe evidence outlined in the previous section suggests that several notable tectonic \nevents accompanied the generation of the IBM boninite suite. The reconstruction in \nFigure 2 places these events in a palaeogeographic context. During the Middle Eocene \na curvi-linear array over 2000km long on the northern margin of the Amami-Oki \nDaito province was subject to IBM boninite magmatism, which locally succeeded and \nwas regionally interspersed with arc tholeiites. To the south, seafloor spreading was \ninitiating between the Amami-Oki Daito province and the southern sub-basin of the \nWest Philippine Basin. The initial crust formed by spreading, and contemporaneous \nmagmatism in the Amami-Oki Daito province, had trace element and isotopic \ncharacteristics of ocean island basalt [Hickey-Vargas, 1998] and was slightly thicker \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 13 \nthan I-MORB crust formed subsequently at the same spreading centre [Mrozowski et \nal., 1982; Okino et al., 1999; Hickey-Vargas, 1991]. In addition, the Amami-Oki \nDaito province was temporarily uplifted and experienced high temperature, low-\npressure metamorphism. Any geodynamic model for genesis of the voluminous \nMiddle Eocene boninite magmatism in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc must explain \nthese events. In addition a source of excess heat, relative to most convergent margins, \nmust have been available in the mantle to produce the distinctive features of the \nboninites themselves. \nA thermal anomaly in the western Pacific mantle \nThere are a number of similarities between the Middle Eocene western Pacific and the \nlarge volume basaltic provinces generated during continental rifting (e.g. [White, \n1997; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998]).  \n1. There was a short-lived, voluminous mafic igneous event inferred to result from \nunusually high mantle temperatures. In volcanic rifted margins a combination of hot \nmantle and decompression causes genesis of large volumes of basaltic magma [White, \n1997; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998]. At convergent margins, the combination of a hot \nmantle source and dehydration of downgoing oceanic lithosphere would also generate \nlarge volumes of basic magma but with distinctive, subduction zone, characteristics. \nThese are the characteristics displayed by the IBM boninite suite.  Relative to average \narc growth rates the excess volume of crust generated in the IBM during the Eocene is \ncomparable to excess crustal generation in hotspot settings.  Bloomer et al. ([Bloomer \net al., 1995] calculated that crustal production along 2000km of the IBM forearc \nduring a 10Ma period in the Eocene exceeded mean rates of arc growth by 50 to 150 \nkm3\/km-Ma. Such rates are comparable with estimates for the amount of excess crust \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 14 \ngenerated in the North Atlantic for 1000km to the north and south of Iceland (125 \nkm3\/km-Ma [Ito et al., 1996]) relative to normal oceanic crust.  The inferred excess \nforearc crust produced along the length of the IBM (1 to 3 x 105 km3\/Ma) is also \ncomparable with estimated excess crustal production rates for the North Atlantic (2.5 \nx 105 km3\/Ma [Ito et al., 1996]), Hawaii (1.6 x 105 km3\/Ma [Watson and McKenzie, \n1991]) and for the Columbia River basalts (1 to 9 x 105 km3\/Ma [Coffin and Eldholm, \n1994]) but is a factor of 2-10 lower than estimates for some large igneous provinces in \noceanic settings, such as Ontong Java and Kerguelen [Coffin and Eldholm, 1994].  \nHowever, subsequent 40Ar-39Ar age data indicate that much of the IBM forearc \nmagmatism occurred in a very short period [Cosca et al., 1998], therefore, the existing \ncalculations [Bloomer et al., 1995] may underestimate the actual excess growth rate \nby as much as a factor of two. \n2. The Amami-Oki Daito province experienced a transitory phase of uplift of similar \nmagnitude to that affecting large igneous provinces (\u2264 1km [Coffin and Eldholm, \n1994]). Due to the complexity of the inferred tectonic setting of the Amami-Oki Daito \nprovince it is impossible to unequivocally identify the mechanism(s) responsible for \nthis uplift.  Uplift can occur on the margins of rifts, and rifted arcs in particular can \nexperience complex histories of uplift and subsidence in the absence of thermal \nanomalies in the mantle [Bloomer et al., 1995; Clift et al., 1995].  However, \nsubsidence of the Amami-Oki Daito province from the Middle Eocene to Quaternary \nis in excess of that expected through isostatic subsidence alone [Mizuno et al., 1979] \nsuggesting some component of dynamic uplift was associated with the original uplift.  \n3. Magmatism in and around the nascent West Philippine Basin possesses trace \nelement and isotopic characteristics atypical of subduction zone environments and \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 15 \nmore akin to magmatism associated with aseismic ridges and volcanic ocean island \nchains that are interpreted to represent focussed upwelling, or plumes, of anomalously \nhot mantle [Coffin and Eldholm, 1994].  In some cases aseismic ridges are linked to \nflood basalt provinces associated with continental break-up suggesting the initial \nstages of hotspot activity may affect very substantial area of lithosphere [Ebinger and \nSleep, 1998]. There is some evidence (outlined above) that the initial oceanic crust at \nthe northern and southern margins of the West Philippine Basin is thicker and \nmorphologically distinct from the crust generated later. Although the thickness does \nnot match that generated at present day hotspots the decrease in thickness and change \nin morphology are consistent with a drop in mantle potential temperature following \nthe initial opening of the basin [c.f. White, 1997]. Since the exact location of the basin \nrelative to any thermal anomaly cannot be pinpointed it is the changes in the crust that \nare the tectonically revealing properties, rather than the actual crustal thickness. \nA mantle plume is a potential mechanism for generating all the unusual geological \nand geochemical features associated with the Philippine Sea Plate in the Middle \nEocene; namely excess heat, high crustal production rates, uplift and an OIB-like \nreservoir.  Mantle hotspots resulting from the presence of a plume are believed to be \nrobust features on timescales of tens of millions of years.  Therefore, it might be \nexpected that a hotspot affecting the Philippine Sea Plate during the Middle Eocene \nwould have left evidence in the subsequent geological record, although the rapid \nrotation of plates in the western Pacific during the Eocene and Oligocene [Hall et al., \n1995; Hall, 1996] mean that such evidence would appear as temporary features.  \nHickey-Vargas [Hickey-Vargas, 1998] suggested that a mantle hotspot currently \nbeneath the Caroline islands may have been responsible for an OIB signature in West \nPhilippine Basin lavas but the present position of Kusaie, the youngest Caroline \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 16 \nisland, was significantly to the northeast of the Philippine Sea Plate during the Middle \nEocene. The only other proposed location for a hotspot in the equatorial western \nPacific is in the Manus Basin. Based on the petrology, geochemistry and 3He\/4He of \nactive magmatism in the eastern Bismarck Sea a mantle hotspot is postulated to exist \nin the vicinity of the Manus Spreading Centre and the St. Andrew Strait Islands \n[Macpherson et al., 1998 and references therein]. The position of the Manus Basin, \nadjusted such that it remains fixed with respect to the Hawaiian hotspot, is plotted on \nFig 2 and lies within the area that experienced the tectonic phenomena outlined above. \nA small circle plotted around this projected location is of similar size to the \nhypothesised plume head associated with initiation of hotspot magmatism in Afar \n[Ebinger and Sleep, 1998]. There is a striking similarity between the scale of plume \ninfluence at Afar and the region of the western Pacific affected by uplift and \nmagmatism in the Middle Eocene. Upwelling and magmatism in Greenland and \nnorthwest Europe during the early Tertiary also occurred in a zone of similar \ndimensions [White, 1997]. \nFigure 3 explores this coincidence further by comparing Nd and Pb isotopic \ncompositions of western Pacific Middle Eocene lavas with those of lavas recently \nerupted in the Manus Basin. Although the data are limited, the Manus Basin lavas are \ntransitional between those erupted in the Oligocene to Miocene backarc basins of the \neastern Philippine Sea Plate and the Middle Eocene PSP-OIB lavas of the West \nPhilippine Basin (Fig. 3). The Manus Basin specimen possessing the highest 3He\/4He \nratio lies very close to the field of trace element enriched Middle Eocene PSP-OIB. \nAlso plotted in Figure 3 are isotopic data for Eocene IBM boninites (grey symbols). \nThe majority of these describe a near vertical array between the field of Pacific \nMORB, with relatively high \u03b5Nd, and a low \u03b5Nd component.  The low \u03b5Nd contaminant \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 17 \ncould be sediment like that thought to contaminate the source of the active Mariana \narc ([Elliott et al., 1997], Fig. 3).  The low \u03b5Nd of Chichijima lavas is consistent with \nan input from a very low \u03b5Nd component that could be subducted sediment (see also \n[Pearce et al., 1999]).  However, for a given 206Pb\/204Pb the remaining IBM boninites \nhave lower 207Pb\/204Pb and 208Pb\/204Pb than active Mariana arc lavas with similar \u03b5Nd. \nThis suggests either a different sediment contaminant or a different component \naltogether.  An alternative low \u03b5Nd contaminant for the IBM boninite lavas (excluding \nChichijima) is mantle similar to the source of PSP-OIB.  A role for OIB-type mantle \nhas previously been proposed to explain both the low \u03b5Nd and the high Zr\/Sm and \nHf\/Sm ratios of IBM boninites [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Hickey-Vargas and Reagan, \n1987] but recent Hf isotope data suggest the excess Hf (and Zr) in IBM boninites may \nbe acquired from basaltic lithologies at very shallow depths in the mantle lithosphere \nor lower crust [Pearce et al., 1999]. Therefore, use of Hf and Zr may lead to erroneous \nconclusions regarding the presence [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Hickey-Vargas, 1987] or \nabsence [Pearce et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 1994] of OIB-type mantle during genesis of \nIBM boninite. Previous models of OIB involvement proposed disparate veins or zones \ncontained in the mantle lithosphere that were composed of frozen metasomatic melts \nderived from OIB \u201cplums\u201d in the asthenosphere [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Hickey-\nVargas, 1987].  If an OIB source was responsible for low \u03b5Nd in IBM boninites the \ngeologic evidence summarised in this work suggests that it originated in a discrete \nthermal anomaly in the convecting mantle that was present throughout much of the \nnascent IBM arc\/West Philippine Basin system during the early Middle Eocene.  This \nis a specific, regionally recognised composition rather than a generic OIB reservoir. \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 18 \nTo assess the subsequent role of a thermal anomaly at the present location of the \nManus Basin we have traced the movement of plates using a recent plate \nreconstruction that models the tectonic development of SE Asia and the western \nPacific in one million year intervals [Hall, 1996]. The calculated \u201chotspot track\u201d is \nillustrated in Figure 4. At the earliest point in the reconstruction the track runs through \nthe Amami-Oki Daito province towards the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc at c. 50 Ma. \nAt this stage the track can be modelled as part of either the northern (Amami-Oki \nDaito province) or southern (southern sub-basin) plate fragments that were spreading \nin the West Philippine Basin (Fig. 2). The change in crustal thickness in the northern \nand southern sections of the West Philippine Basin, compared with the central portion \n(see above), suggests that both plates may have been influenced by the anomaly at \naround 50 Ma, therefore, the track can been modelled as belonging to both fragments. \nThe separation of the two tracks during this period (50Ma to 45Ma) is due to \nsubsequent (N-S, present orientation) extension of the West Philippine Basin (and \nPalau-Kyushu Ridge) about the Central Basin Fault (Fig. 4). Both tracks for this \nperiod trend towards the east under the Palau-Kyushu Ridge suggesting the Izu-\nBonin-Mariana forearc rotated over the thermal anomaly during the late Eocene. Data \npertaining to the cessation of boninitic magmatism in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc \nis equivocal. However, it is possible that boninites were generated in Guam and Palau, \nclose to the parts of the track crossing the arc, for some time after the main phase of \nforearc magmatism had ended [Cosca et al., 1998]. Later opening of the Parece Vela \nBasin and the Mariana Trough has further disrupted the northern track (Fig. 4). After \ntraversing the arc the anomaly would have lain beneath part of the Pacific Plate that \nwas subsequently subducted under the east Philippine Sea plate margin and therefore \nthe track disappears from c. 46 to 33 Ma. \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 19 \nThe hotspot track reappears at the southern margin of the Caroline Plate in the early \nOligocene (c. 33 Ma) and crosses the central part of the plate describing a northward \npath to 25 Ma, after which it reverses to trend south until 10 Ma (Fig. 4). This path \nlies close to the Eauripik Rise, a bathymetric high trending N-S across the Caroline \nPlate (Figs. 1). Unfortunately the nature of the Eauripik Rise is virtually unknown \nfrom direct sampling. However, bathymetric and seismic profiles suggest it formed \nthrough excess volcanism [Altis, 1999 and references therein]. The coincidence of the \ncalculated hotspot track with this feature suggests that the Eauripik Rise may record \nthe Late Oligocene to Miocene location of the hotspot postulated to presently exist in \nthe Manus Basin. Calculation of the track during the Late Miocene to Quaternary is \ncomplicated by the large number of plate fragments required in the reconstruction of \nnorth New Guinea and the Bismarck Sea. The calculated position at 10 Ma lies \nslightly southwest of Manus Island, but this may be due to subsequent subduction of \nthe southernmost Caroline Plate at the Manus Trench. This would result in the 10 Ma \nhotspot position appearing on the plate that has overridden the actual hotspot-stained \nlithosphere. Jaques [Jaques, 1981] used trace element characteristics to propose that \nQuaternary lavas from western Manus Island, the M\u2019Buke and Johnstone Islands and \nSt. Andrew Strait represent a hotspot trace trending southeast towards the Manus \nBasin. This trace could represent the youngest manifestation of a thermal anomaly \ncurrently located beneath the eastern Bismarck Sea. \nIn summary, the geological evidence suggests that the mantle currently lying beneath \nthe Manus Basin has generated excess magmatism for substantial portions of the \nCenozoic. At the start of the Middle Eocene crust formed in the nascent West \nPhilippine Basin had an EM-2 isotopic signature [Hickey-Vargas, 1998] and was \nslightly thicker than the crust subsequently generated in the same basin. In addition, \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 20 \nboninitic and basaltic magma were derived from a hot mantle source close to the Izu-\nBonin-Mariana forearc [Taylor, 1992] in volumes that exceed normal arc production \nby amounts similar to those characterising active hotspots. From the Oligocene to the \npresent day the central Caroline Plate, where the Eauripik Rise is now located, \nmigrated south then north across the present position of the Manus Basin hotspot.  \nThe Quaternary part of the hotspot track may be preserved in the lavas on and around \nManus Island. \nOrigin of the IBM boninite suite \nTaken together these pieces of evidence suggest that a thermal anomaly has existed in \nthe western Pacific mantle since at least the Middle Eocene and has influenced \ntectonics and magmatism on several plates. Middle Eocene magmatism was dispersed \nover an area comparable to that postulated for the initial phases of magmatism \nassociated with Iceland and Afar [White 1997; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998]. We \nspeculate, therefore, that the Middle Eocene magmatism of the western Pacific \ndeveloped its particular character because subduction was initiated in a region in \nwhich there was already a \u201cstart-up plume head\u201d, or in which hot mantle was very \nefficiently transported laterally from a more restricted anomaly in a short period. Such \na scenario would provide the excess heat required to uplift the Amami-Oki Daito \nprovince and to generate IBM boninitic magmatism, and could also provide the \ndistinctive reservoir sampled by lavas in the overriding plate during the Middle \nEocene. A combination of the excess heat provided by a large thermal anomaly and \nfluid released from the slab would promote melting of mantle lithosphere in the \noverriding plate that is refractory in most subduction zones [Crawford et al., 1989]. \nUnder these circumstances mafic veins or domains in the shallow lithosphere or lower \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 21 \ncrust would also be expected to melt providing the high Zr\/Ti, Zr\/Sm and Hf\/Sm of \nthe boninites [Pearce et al., 1999]. Where temperatures were not sufficient to cause \nmelting of the overriding lithosphere fluid fluxing of anomalously hot mantle wedge \nwould produce large volumes of relatively depleted island arc tholeiite [Bloomer et \nal., 1995]. \nBoninitic magmatism lasted only as long as hot material associated with the thermal \nanomaly was available to provide heat to the mantle lithosphere of the overriding \nplate.  By the Late Eocene and Oligocene magmatism in the West Philippine Basin \nhad reverted to an I-MORB affinity suggesting that the basin had been removed from \nthe zone of influence of the thermal\/chemical anomaly by clockwise rotation [Hall et \nal., 1995] and\/or a diminution of the area influenced by the anomaly.  In addition, \nmantle circulation through the mantle wedge would eventually replace anomalously \nhot material with upwelling asthenosphere from deeper levels resulting in more \nnormal arc and backarc magmatism in the post-Middle Eocene IBM arc and West \nPhilippine Basin, respectively.  As noted above, localised boninite genesis in Guam \nand Palau may have post-dated the main phase of forearc magmatism [Cosca et al., \n1998].  This would be consistent with conversion from a \u201cstart-up plume\u201d during the \nMiddle Eocene to a \u201cplume tail\u201d that subsequently generated a restricted Oligocene-\nMiocene aseismic rise on the Caroline Plate. \nInitiation of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc \nThere is evidence for limited subduction zone magmatism in the Izu-Bonin and \nMariana arcs prior to the Middle Eocene. Island arc tholeiites lie beneath boninite \nlavas at DSDP Site 458 [Hickey-Vargas, 1989] and arc magmatism was active at \nDSDP Site 296 at approximately 48 Ma [Ozima et al., 1977], but at other sites \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 22 \nboninites and arc tholeiites are inter-bedded [Bloomer et al., 1995, Taylor, 1992]. The \ninception of subduction in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc may have been a localised \nphenomenon that was enhanced by the presence of large contrasts in mantle structure \nassociated with a thermal anomaly. Warm, buoyant mantle associated with the \nanomaly would make the overlying lithosphere resistant to subduction while cooler \nasthenosphere underlay the lithosphere to the north and east (Fig. 2). Incipient or \nexisting subduction close to the boundary between these domains could exploit this \ncontrast to rapidly propagate along the boundary. Magmatism could commence nearly \nsimultaneously along the margin of the thermal anomaly and would possess a \nboninitic character due to the unusual thermal structure of the mantle.  From this it \ncan be inferred that the widespread boninitic magmatism of the IBM forearc is a \nresult of interaction between a subduction zone and a thermal anomaly, rather than a \ncharacteristic of infant subduction zones. \nSince the excess heat required to promote melting of the oceanic mantle lithosphere is \nprovided by the mantle, this model does not require, but does not preclude, subduction \nof an unusually hot (young) slab. Subduction of a young slab at the initiation of the \nnorth-facing Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc was first proposed to account for convergent \nmotion between the arc and the Pacific Plate in tectonic reconstructions [Seno and \nMaruyama, 1984]. The Pacific Plate was moving northwards prior to the plate motion \nchange at 43 Ma suggested by the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. A \nyoung slab entering the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction zone was postulated as part of \na (now fully subducted) North New Guinea Plate, which was spreading southwards \nfrom a WNW-ESE striking spreading centre in the western Pacific. As discussed \nabove there are dynamic problems with subduction of young crust over such a large \ndistance and this explanation also fails to satisfactorily answer the question as to how \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 23 \nthe arc was initiated. The absence of substantial amounts of IBM arc crust older than \nthe Middle Eocene requires that subduction of the North New Guinea Plate must have \nbeen initiated parallel to the spreading ridge in relatively young lithosphere along a \ndistance of some 2000km. Removal of the North New Guinea Plate from tectonic \nreconstructions reintroduces the problem of how to accommodate Middle Eocene \nconvergence between the Philippine Sea and Pacific plates. One possibility is that \nthere was no 43 Ma change in Pacific Plate motion [Norton, 1995]. Alternatively, \nclockwise rotation of the Philippine Sea Plate [Hall, 1996 and references therein], \nWest Philippine Basin spreading [Hilde and Lee, 1984] and extension in the IBM \nforearc [Bloomer, 1995] are all mechanisms that could have operated at this time to \nprovide suitable plate vectors. There may also have been other small plates in the \nwestern Pacific at this time. \nOther examples of plume-subduction zone interaction \nInteraction between hot mantle and subduction zones on a scale comparable with that \nsuggested for the Middle Eocene Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc is not recognised in any \nactive convergent margins. With the exception of the Izu-Bonin and Mariana forearcs, \nboninites are present in relatively small volumes compared to coeval magmatism in \nCenozoic arcs and in Phanerozoic ophiolites [Cameron, 1985; Jenner, 1981, \nEncarnaci\u00f3n et al., 1999; Tatsumi and Maruyama, 1989, Cameron, 1989; Crawford et \nal., 1989]. This probably reflects the difficulty in promoting shallow melting of \nresidual harzburgite under the influence of typical arc geotherms, and the generation \nof other Cenozoic boninite suites may reflect operation of tectonic phenomena that \ncan only locally elevate the geotherm to a sufficient degree. Proximity to a magmatic \nrift or spreading centre in the overriding plate, or the subduction of young oceanic \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 24 \nlithosphere are among the most popular theories for providing excess heat to \nconvergent margins [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Pearce et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 1994; \nTatsumi and Maruyama, 1989].  \nOne example of present interaction between a plume-tail and a subduction zone may \nbe in the Tonga arc. Elevated 3He\/4He ratios in magmatism from the northern Lau \nBasin are believed to represent Samoan hotspot material that entered the mantle \nbeneath the Tonga Trench around the start of the Pliocene and subsequently migrated \na short distance to the south [Poreda, 1985].  High-Ca boninites have been dredged \nfrom the northern termination of the Tonga arc and have been interpreted to result \nfrom interaction between hot, depleted mantle from the Samoan hotspot and the \nnorthern Tonga subduction zone [Falloon and Danyushevsky, 2000]. \nExamples of Late Archean plume-subduction zone interaction have been postulated in \nthe greenstone belts of North America. Boninitic-type lavas are interbedded with calc-\nalkaline and komatiitic lavas in the Abitibi Belt in Canada [Wyman, 1999]. Temporal \nassociations of the different types of lavas vary between different locations leading \nWyman [Wyman, 1999] to suggest that a single plume may have interacted with \ndifferent arcs over a period of approximately 50 Ma. Interaction between a thermal \nanomaly and subduction zones as outlined above for the Philippine Sea Plate and \nCaroline Plate suggests the western Pacific may provide a suitable modern analogue \nfor the Archean Abitibi Belt. \nSummary \nBoninites occur in restricted volumes in several Cenozoic locations [Crawford et al., \n1989] but the large areal extent of the IBM boninite suite is problematic and requires \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 25 \nan unusual geodynamic setting in the western Pacific during the Middle Eocene. This \npaper provides a model that explains the voluminous IBM boninitic magmatism in the \ncontext of other, simultaneous tectonic events in the region. The model suggests that \nwidespread boninitic magmatism of the IBM forearc is the result of interaction \nbetween a subduction zone and a thermal anomaly, rather than a characteristic of \ninfant subduction zones. This model may not apply to all locations in which boninites \nare found but may be relevant to northern Tonga and to Archean magmas with \nboninitic affinities. \nPlate tectonic reconstruction suggests that OIB-style magmatism and uplift of the \nnorthern rift margin accompanied rifting in the West Philippine Basin. The location of \nthese events lies close to a point in the mantle where a thermal anomaly is presently \ninferred from petrology and geochemistry. Furthermore, an aseismic ridge, the \nEauripik Rise, lies on the part of the Caroline plate that passed over the same point \nduring the Oligocene and Miocene. These facts suggest that excess magmatism may \nhave been generated close to this particular location from the Middle Eocene until the \npresent day. The region of high heat-flow during the Early Eocene may have \ninteracted with an existing but restricted subduction zone, or zones, leading to \ndevelopment of a 2000km magmatic arc and generation of the IBM boninite suite. \nThe absence of analogous extensive boninitic suites in the Phanerozoic rock record \nmay result from the unusual juxtaposition of zones of upwelling (hotspots) and \ndownwelling (subduction) in the mantle. The more restricted volumes of boninite \nsuites found elsewhere in the Cenozoic reflect interaction between hot mantle and \nsubduction on much smaller scales or the operation of other mechanisms that facilitate \na suitable combination of sources and geotherms in subduction zones. \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 26 \nAcknowledgements \nFunding from the Southeast Asia Research Group supported by Arco, Canadian \nPetroleum, Exxon, LASMO, Anglo American, Mobil, Union Texas and Unocal is \ngratefully acknowledged.

The Philippine Sea Plate is \noutlined by the dashed line. Relevant geographic and bathymetric features are \nlabelled. Abbreviations: WPB, West Philippine Basin; NWSB, Northwest sub-basin; \nSSB, southern sub-basin, RT, Ryukyu Trench; Phil T., Philippine Trench. Symbols \nrepresent DSDP\/ODP drill sites and Izu-Bonin-Mariana boninite series sampling sites \nof Middle Eocene magmatism.  Different symbols represent petrogenetic types \nidentified using trace element characteristics [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; DeBari et al., \n1999; Hickey-Vargas, 1998; Hickey-Vargas, 1991]; see Figure 2 for key. Thin lines \nrepresent magnetic anomalies from Hilde and Lee [Hilde and Lee, 1984]. \nFigure 2. Plate reconstruction of Southeast Asia and the western Pacific at 50 Ma, at \nthe start of the Middle Eocene [Hall, 1996]. The locations of the Izu-Bonin and \nMariana arcs are indicated, along with estimated extents of pre-Middle Eocene crust \nof the Amami-Oki Daito Province and the Southern sub-basin of the West Philippine \nBasin (WPB). Sampling sites of Middle Eocene magmatism on the present day \nPhilippine Sea Plate (PSP) and the IBM forearc are shown with symbols representing \nthe geochemical nature of the magmas erupted during the Middle Eocene. The I-\nMORB sample from the Izu-Bonin Trench wall is probably pre-Middle Eocene \n[DeBari et al., 1999]. Radiometric ages of most of the plotted WPB lavas are within \nerror of 50Ma [Ozima et al., 1977, Hickey-Vargas, 1998, McKee and Klock, 1980]. \nAges for the IBM boninite suite vary between 55 and 44 Ma with a mode at 45 Ma \n[Cosca et al., 1998]. Classification of these lavas as MORB, E-MORB or OIB is \nbased on trace element characteristics [Hickey-Vargas, 1989; DeBari et al., 1999; \nHickey-Vargas, 1998; Hickey-Vargas, 1991]. Small diamonds represent sites where \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 32 \ntrace element data are not available but ocean island magmatism is inferred from the \npetrology and major element chemistry. The inferred location of the Manus Basin \nhotspot centre is plotted and has been migrated such that it remains fixed with respect \nto the Hawaiian hotspot. A small circle of 750 km radius is drawn around this point to \nrepresent the size of the plume-head inferred for the Afar plume [Ebinger and Sleep, \n1998]. \nFigure 3. Initial 206Pb\/204Pb and 143Nd\/144Nd isotope ratios of lavas from the West \nPhilippine Basin, the Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc, the Palau-Kyushu Arc, Oligocene to \nMiocene backarc basins of the eastern Philippine Sea Plate and the Manus Basin \n[Hickey-Vargas, 1989; Stern et al., 1991; Pearce et al., 1992; Hickey-Vargas and \nReagan, 1987; Taylor et al., 1994; Pearce et al., 1999; Woodhead et al., 1999; DeBari \net al., 1999; Hickey-Vargas, 1998; Hickey-Vargas, 1991]. Ranges of modern Pacific \nand Indian MORB are shown for comparison. Classification of Philippine Sea Plate \nlavas as MORB, E-MORB or OIB is based on trace element characteristics [Hickey-\nVargas, 1989; DeBari et al., 1999; Hickey-Vargas, 1998; Hickey-Vargas, 1991]. \nFigure 4. Map of western Pacific and SE Asia showing the 55 Ma-present track of a \nthermal anomaly currently located beneath the Manus Basin calculated from the \ntectonic reconstruction of Hall [Hall, 1996]. Labelled yellow squares show positions \nat 5 Ma intervals and red circles are positions at intervening 1 Ma intervals from 55 \nMa to 30 Ma. A yellow line links subsequent 5 Ma intervals. There are two segments \nfrom 50 Ma to 45 Ma since the track can be calculated for either the northern or \nsouthern segments of the West Philippine Basin, which was actively spreading at that \ntime. The northern track is further divided into two parts due to subsequent spreading \nin the Parece Vela Basin and Mariana Trough. From 45 Ma to 33 Ma the track is not \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 33 \nmarked since it would have been located on Pacific Plate lithosphere that has now \nbeen subducted. Calculation of the 10 Ma to present day section (dotted line) is \ncomplicated by tectonics (see text for discussion). \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 34 \n \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 35 \n \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 36 \n \nMacpherson and Hall West Pacific Eocene Tectonics 37 \n \n"}
