Introduction\nLet M be a set of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space H endowed\nwith the strong operator topology inherited from the identification of\nclosed subspaces K with their self-adjoint projections [K] : H \u2192 K. If\nM is finitely parametrised in the sense that\nM = {[K\u03bb] : \u03bb \u2208M \u2286 Rn}\nwith M a topological manifold, thenM may in fact be homeomorphic\nto M . Furthermore M may admit a certain local unitary description\nand an associated smooth structure under which it is a diffeomorph of\na differentiable manifold in Rn. Natural examples of such manifolds\nof projections are provided by Grassmannian manifolds and their sub-\nmanifolds. Also, operators T in the first Cowen-Douglas class [1], [2]\nfor a complex connected domain \u2126 in Cm provide diverse realisations\n(even for m = 1) of domains in R2m, namely\nMT = {[ker(T \u2212 \u03c9I)] : \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126 \u2286 R2m}.\nHowever our primary motivating examples derive from invariant sub-\nspaces for semigroups of unitary operators, such as the semigroup\nW = {\u03b1UtVs : s, t \u2208 R+, |\u03b1| = 1} associated with jointly irreducible\none parameter unitary groups satisfying the Weyl commutation rela-\ntions. Furthermore, such subspaces and their complementary spaces\nMay 13, 2009.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 47B38, 46E20, 58D15.\nKey words and phrases. Lie semigroups, projection manifolds, Hardy spaces.\n1\n2 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nare generally infinite dimensional. These examples motivate the consid-\neration of general subspace manifolds as formulated in Definitions 2.1,\n2.2 and 2.3.\nThe embracing realm we consider is the set of Hilbert space subspaces\nof the form\nuH2(R), uH2(R), L2(E)\nwhere H2(R) is the Hardy space for the upper half plane, u(x) is uni-\nmodular, and L2(E) is the space of functions supported on a measur-\nable set E. These spaces are fundamental in the analysis of various shift\ninvariant subspaces. They feature, in transposed form, in Beurling\u2019s\ncelebrated characterisation of invariant subspaces for the shift operator\non H2(T) as well as in many other operator function theory perspec-\ntives. See Nikolskii [13] for example. We examine subspace manifolds\nof the form\nM =M(S) = {[ei\u03c8(x)H2(R)] : \u03c8(x) \u2208 S},\nwhere S is a finite dimensional real vector space of real-valued func-\ntions, we analyse limits of projections and we identify the associated\nclosed topological manifolds. Our approach and the ensuing identifica-\ntions give a unified explanation for various so called \u201cstrange limits\u201d of\nprojections. These include the special cases considered by Katavolos\nand Power [7], [8] which were derived by ad hoc arguments leaning on\noperator algebra methods. Specifically we show by direct methods that\nthe space of functions\nS1 = {\u03bb1x+ \u03bb2x2 : \u03bb = (\u03bb1, \u03bb2) \u2208 R2},\nhas subspace manifold M(S1) whose closure is homeomorphic to the\nclosed unit disc, while for the space\nS2 = {\u03bb1 log |x|+ \u03bb2x+ \u03bb3x\u22121 : \u03bb \u2208 R3},\nthe manifold M(S2) has closure homeomorphic to the closed unit ball\nin R3. In contrast, the closures of Cowen-Douglas projection manifolds\nare generally one point compactifications.\nA consequence of the limit projection analyses in [7], [8] is that a re-\nducing invariant subspace for the Weyl semigroup W , or for the ax+ b\nunitary semigroup (with a \u2265 1 and b \u2265 0), turns out to be a strong op-\nerator topology limit of a sequence of purely invariant projections, that\nis, a limit of those with no reducing part. We obtain in Theorem 3.7 a\nsimilar phenomenon for the multiplication semigroup {Mei\u03bbx : \u03bb \u2265 0}\nacting on L2(R). Equivalently, translating to the circle T, we show\nthat each reducing invariant subspace for the bilateral shift, which cor-\nresponds to a measurable subset of T, is a strong operator topology\nlimit of Beurling projections [uH2(T)]. We are not aware of any other\nproof, direct or indirect, of this seemingly classical fact.\nOur principal tool is Theorem 3.4 which, for a function \u03c8 in a certain\nadmissible class, identifies the limit of the projections [ein\u03c8H2(R)], as\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 3\nn\u2192\u221e, with the projection [L2((\u03c8\u2032)\u22121(\u2212\u221e, 0))]. The proof makes use\nof methods of Stein [17] for the analysis of oscillatory integrals. We go\non to show that for quite general n dimensional spaces S of admissible\nfunctions the subspace manifold M(S) has closure homeomorphic to\nthe closed unit ball in Rn. Moreover, in these cases the two-component\nsubspace manifold M(S) \u222aM(S)\u22a5 has closure, denoted \u03a3(S), which\nis homeomorphic to an n-sphere. The 2-sphere \u03a3FP = \u03a3(S1) is the\nso-called Fourier-Plancherel sphere of [8]. (See Figure 5.1 and Exam-\nple 4.9.) It is natural to consider how such Hilbert space manifolds\nmay be classified geometrically, that is, up to unitary equivalence, and\nin the examples of Section 4 and Section 5.3 we distinguish a number\nof distinct 2-spheres and 3-spheres.\nIn Section 5 we consider the sphere \u03a3(S1) and its hyperbolic variant,\nthe 3-sphere \u03a3(S2), from the point of view of their unitary automor-\nphism symmetries. The analysis here exploits the nontrivial foliations\ninduced by the natural order on projections. Let F : L2(R) \u2192 L2(R)\nbe the Fourier-Plancherel transform, that is, the unitary operator\nFf(x) =\n1\u221a\n2pi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nf(y)e\u2212ixy dy, f \u2208 L2(R).\nIt is shown that the group U(\u03a3(S1)) of unitaries which act bijectively\non \u03a3(S1) is generated by the set\n{Mei\u03bbx ,Meisx2 , \u03b1I, F : \u03bb, s \u2208 R, |\u03b1| = 1}\nconsisting of two 1-parameter unitary groups, the scalar circle group\nand F . In particular, this group contains the group of dilations {Vt :\nt \u2208 R}, as we show explicitly in Lemma 5.1. A similarly detailed\ndescription is given for U(\u03a3(S2)) and this leads to the identification of\nthe unitary automorphism group as a certain double semidirect product\nAd(U(\u03a3(S2))) \u223c=\n(\nR3 oR\n)\no (Z\/2Z)2.\nThe manifolds M(S), Beurling subspace manifolds in our terminol-\nogy, may be regarded as smooth in the strict, locally unitary, sense\nthat a neighbourhood of a subspace K is given by the local action on\nK of a certain unitary group representation of Rn. Furthermore the\nFourier-Plancherel 2-sphere \u03a3FP is remarkable in being smooth in this\nway at all points except the poles 0, I. It of interest then to identify\nsimilar compact projection manifolds which are smooth off a finite set.\nIn this regard we see in Section 5.3 that this is not generally the case\nfor other polynomial 2-spheres \u03a3(S).\nAs we have intimated above our considerations lie entirely in the\nrealm of operator function theory tied to the Hardy space for the line.\nHowever the oscillatory integral methods are expected to be effective\nin multivariable function spaces and for higher rank settings in non-\ncommutative harmonic analysis. This should lead to the identification\n4 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nof other closed subspace manifolds with interesting topology and ge-\nometry.\nAcknowledgements.

Subspace manifolds\nIn this section we give some definitions and examples.\nLet H be a separable Hilbert space, Proj(H) the set of self-adjoint\nprojections and Unit(H) the set of unitary operators. We shall rou-\ntinely identify a closed subspace K with its associated orthogonal pro-\njection, denoted [K]. For U \u2208 Unit(H) and T \u2208 B(H) we will write\n(AdU)T = UTU\u2217, so that, in particular, AdU [K] = [UK].\nDefinition 2.1. (i) A topological subspace manifold in B(H) of di-\nmension n is a set M \u2286 Proj(H), considered with the relative strong\noperator topology, which is locally homeomorphic to Rn.\n(ii) A C\u221e projection manifold in B(H) (or C\u221e subspace manifold)\nis a topological subspace manifoldM of dimension n together with an\natlas of charts xi : Rn \u2192M (with open domains and ranges covering\nM) for which the coordinate functions x\u22121i xj (with nonempty domain)\nare C\u221e and such that for each chart x with domain Ux there is a dense\nsubspace Dx of C\u221e vectors in H; that is, for f, g \u2208 Dx, the function\n\u03bb 7\u2192 \u3008x(\u03bb)f, g\u3009 is C\u221e on Ux.\nIn fact we bypass the technicalities of (ii) in Definition 2.1 in view\nof the fact that the smooth subspace manifolds we consider have a\nstronger locally unitary structure as in the following formal definition.\nDefinition 2.2. A locally unitary subspace manifold of dimension n in\nB(H) is a topological subspace manifoldM such that for each P inM\nthere is a strong operator topology neighbourhood in M of the form\nNP = {[\u03c1P (\u03bb)PH] : \u03bb \u2208 Bn}\nwhere \u03c1P : Rn \u2192 Unit(H) is a strong operator topology continuous\nrepresentation which is a homeomorphism of Np into Unit(H).\nIt is well-known that such a representation \u03c1P does possess a dense\nsubspace of C\u221e vectors; see [18], for example.\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 5\nWe shall consider Beurling subspace manifolds M, given formally\nin the next definition, together with their complement completions, by\nwhich we mean the strong operator topology closure of M\u222aM\u22a5.\nDefinition 2.3. A Beurling subspace manifold of dimension n is a\ntopological subspace manifold M\u2286 Proj(L2(R)) of the form\nM = {[u\u03bbH2(R)] : \u03bb \u2208 Rn}\nwhere \u03bb 7\u2192 u\u03bb is a weak star continuous representation of Rn as uni-\nmodular functions, so that M is locally homeomorphic to Rn by the\nsingle chart x(\u03bb) = [u\u03bbH\n2(R)].\nIf \u03c8 is a non-constant real continuous function on the line then the\nprojections [exp(i\u03bb\u03c8)H2(R)], for \u03bb \u2208 R, give a one dimensional topo-\nlogical manifold. When \u03c8(x) = x the closure in Proj(L2(R)) adds the\nsubspaces {0} and L2(R) and the complement completion, \u03a3a say, is\ntopologically a circle. On the other hand for \u03c8(x) = x2 we shall see\nthat the closure of M({\u03bbx2 : \u03bb \u2208 R}) adds [L2(R+)] and [L2(R\u2212)]\nand that the complement completion \u03a3e is a locally unitary C\n\u221e sub-\nspace manifold diffeomorphic to the circle. We see later in Example 4.9\nthat \u03a3e and \u03a3a are, respectively, the equator and a great circle of the\nFourier-Plancherel sphere.\nThe subspaces K\u03bb,s = e\ni\u03bbxeisx\n2\nH2(R), for s < 0 and \u03bb \u2208 R, form\na subspace manifold M which arises in the analysis of the invariant\nsubspaces for the Weyl semigroup\nW = {\u03b1Mei\u03bbxD\u00b5 : \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2265 0, |\u03b1| = 1},\nwhere D\u00b5 is the translation unitary D\u00b5f(x) = f(x\u2212 \u00b5). Indeed it was\nshown in [7] that the invariant subspaces of W are the spaces K\u03bb,s for\ns \u2264 0, together with L2(t,\u221e) for t in R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e} and, moreover, that\nthe latter subspaces are in the closure ofM. Extending the parameter\nrange of s to include s \u2265 0 and taking the complement completion one\nobtains the Fourier-Plancherel sphere. The Volterra circle \u03a3v consists\nof the subspaces L2(t,\u221e), L2(\u2212\u221e, t) for t \u2208 R\u222a{\u00b1\u221e} and is unitarily\nequivalent to the great circle \u03a3a via the Fourier-Plancherel transform.\nConsider now the three dimensional subspace manifold\nM = {[ |x|isei\u03bbxei\u00b5x\u22121H2(R) ] : (s, \u03bb, \u00b5) \u2208 R3}\nwhich is the Beurling subspace manifold M(S2) for the space\nS2 = {s log |x|+ \u03bbx+ \u00b5x\u22121 : (s, \u03bb, \u00b5) \u2208 R3}.\nIn Section 4 we give a new direct proof that M is homeomorphic to a\nclosed 3-ball and that \u03a3(S2) =M\u222aM\u22a5 is a topological 3-sphere.\nThe Beurling subspace manifolds given above might be more pre-\ncisely specified as Euclidean Beurling subspace manifolds as there are\nmany other interesting C\u221e projection manifolds associated with Hardy\n6 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nspaces and unimodular functions. We do not develop this here but we\nnote some fundamental examples.\nFor n = 1, 2, . . . let\nMn = {[u\u03bbH2(R)] : \u03bb = (\u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbn) \u2208 Hn}\nwhere u\u03bb(z) is a Blaschke factor inner function with zeros, possibly\nrepeated, at points \u03bb1, . . . , \u03bbn in the upper half plane H. Then Mn is\na C\u221e projection manifold in B(H2(R)). Also,M1 consists of codimen-\nsion 1 projections and is locally unitary with respect to a representation\nof the Mo\u00a8bius group rather than the Euclidean group. The closure of\nM1 adds one extra projection, namely [H2(R)], and is a topological\nsubspace manifold homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, realised as the one\npoint compactification of H.\nManifolds analogous to these, with finite or cofinite dimensional\nspaces, may be defined also for Bergman Hilbert spaces, and, more\ngenerally, in the setting of Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles asso-\nciated with operators in the Cowen-Douglas theory [1]. For example,\nwith weighted Bergman Hilbert spaces in place of H2(R) one obtains\nprojection manifold realisations of the unit disc with one point com-\npactification closures. That these are unitarily inequivalent was es-\nsentially shown in [1] by the construction of curvature invariants for\nHermitian holomorphic vector bundles. This underlines the fact that\nunitary equivalence here is a strong form of geometric equivalence for\nsubspace manifolds. We note the following alternative curvature free\napproach to this and in subsequent sections we find, similarly, that we\ndo not need to consider curvature. However, it would of course be inter-\nesting and useful to define curvature invariants for general projection\nmanifolds.\nLet \u03b1 \u2265 0 and let A2\u03b1 be the weighted Bergman Hilbert space of\nholomorphic functions in the unit disc that are square integrable with\nrespect to (1\u2212|z|2)\u03b1dA, where dA is area measure. For \u03bb in D let u\u03bb(z)\nbe the inner function (\u03bb \u2212 z)\/(1 \u2212 \u03bbz) and let M\u03b1 be the projection\nmanifold\nM\u03b1 = {[u\u03bbA2\u03b1] : \u03bb \u2208 D}.\nThe range of the complementary projection [u\u03bbA\n2\n\u03b1]\n\u22a5 is one-dimensional\nand is spanned by the function (1\u2212\u03bbz)2\u2212\u03b1. (See Zhu [21], for example.)\nA standard argument with eigenvectors (see Theorem 3.6 of Thom-\nson [19] for example) shows that an operator which leaves invariant all\nthese subspaces is necessarily multiplication by the complex conjugate\nof an H\u221e function. Thus if U is a unitary with AdU(M\u03b1) = M\u03b2\nthen we may deduce that AdU gives an isomorphism between the re-\nspective H\u221e multiplication algebras. Composing with a unitary au-\ntomorphism of B(A2\u03b2) which effects the inverse Mo\u00a8bius automorphism\non the range algebra we thus obtain a unitary operator W between\nthe Bergman spaces which intertwines multiplication: MzW = WMz.\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 7\nThus if W1 = g then Wzm = zmg. For \u03b1 6= \u03b2 this is contrary to W\nbeing isometric.\nProposition 2.4. For \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2265 0 the projection manifolds M\u03b1 and M\u03b2\nare unitarily equivalent if and only if \u03b1 = \u03b2.\n3. Strange limits\nWe now develop methods that will be useful for identifying the clo-\nsures of various Beurling subspace manifolds.\nIf \u03d5 \u2208 L\u221e(R) then we write M\u03d5 for the corresponding multiplication\noperator on L2(R). In particular, if B is a measurable subset of R\nand \u03c7B denotes its characteristic function then M\u03c7B is the projection\n[L2(B)].\nProposition 3.1. Let B be an open subset of R. A sequence of projec-\ntions Pn converges in the strong operator topology to M\u03c7B if and only\nif\n(i) \u2016Pn\u03c7E\u20162 \u2192 \u2016\u03c7E\u20162 for every compact interval E \u2286 B, and\n(ii) \u2016Pn\u03c7F\u20162 \u2192 0 for every compact interval F \u2286 R \\B.\nProof. Necessity is clear. Suppose that (i) and (ii) hold, and let E and\nF be disjoint compact intervals. If either is a subset of R \\ B then\n|\u3008Pn\u03c7E, \u03c7F \u3009| \u2264 \u2016Pn\u03c7E\u2016 \u2016Pn\u03c7F\u2016 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e. On the other hand, if\nE,F \u2286 B then for k \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3},\n2 Re ik\u3008Pn\u03c7E, \u03c7F \u3009 = \u2016Pn(ik\u03c7E + \u03c7F )\u20162 \u2212 \u2016Pn\u03c7E\u20162 \u2212 \u2016Pn\u03c7F\u20162\n\u2264 \u2016\u03c7E\u20162 \u2212 \u2016Pn\u03c7E\u20162 + \u2016\u03c7F\u20162 \u2212 \u2016Pn\u03c7F\u20162 \u2192 0\nas n\u2192\u221e, and we again conclude that \u3008Pn\u03c7E, \u03c7F \u3009 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e.\nSince the unit ball of B(L2(R)) is compact and metrisable in the\nweak operator topology, there is a positive contraction C which is a\nweak cluster point of {Pn}, say Pnk \u2192 C weakly. Now \u3008C\u03c7E, \u03c7F \u3009 = 0\nfor disjoint compact intervals E,F which are each contained in either\nB or its complement; an approximation argument shows that this re-\nmains the case whenever E and F are disjoint bounded measurable\nsets. Approximation by simple functions yields \u3008C\u03c7E, \u03c7Ff\u3009 = 0 for\nevery f \u2208 L2(R), and similarly \u3008C\u03c7Eg, \u03c7Ff\u3009 = 0 for all f, g \u2208 L2(R).\nIt follows that C = M\u03d5 for some \u03d5 \u2208 L\u221e(R) with 0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2264 1 and\nsupp\u03d5 \u2286 B. If E is a compact interval which is contained in B, then\n\u2016Pnk\u03c7E\u20162 = \u3008Pnk\u03c7E, \u03c7E\u3009 \u2192 \u2016\u03c7E\u20162 = \u3008\u03d5\u03c7E, \u03c7E\u3009, which forces \u03d5 to be\nequal to 1 almost everywhere on E. Since B is open, C = M\u03c7B . Thus\nthe weak limit of {Pnk} is a projection, M\u03c7B , from which it follows that\nsot-limk\u2192\u221e Pnk = M\u03c7B as well.\nThus every subsequence of {Pn} has a subsubsequence whose limit\nin the strong operator topology is M\u03c7B . Since the unit ball of B(L2(R))\nis metrisable in this topology, this shows that Pn \u2192M\u03c7B strongly. \u0003\n8 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nWe now determine conditions under which we can identify the strong\noperator topology convergence Pn \u2192 M\u03c7B for a sequence of Beurling\nprojections Pn = [e\nikn\u03c8H2(R)] as kn \u2192 \u221e, where B is a subset of R\ndetermined by \u03c8\u2032.\nDefinition 3.2. A partial function \u03c8 : R \u2192 R is admissible if the\nfollowing subsets of R are discrete (that is, they have no accumulation\npoints):\n(i) the set \u0393(\u03c8) of points at which \u03c8 is undefined, or at which \u03c8\nfails to be twice continuously differentiable;\n(ii) (\u03c8\u2032)\u22121(0); and\n(iii) the set \u039b(\u03c8) consisting of the points at which sgn(\u03c8\u2032\u2032) is not\nlocally constant.\nFor example, non-constant rational functions and the trigonometric\nfunctions are easily seen to be admissible, as is the map x 7\u2192 log |x|.\nRecall that F : L2(R) \u2192 L2(R) is the unitary Fourier-Plancherel\ntransform. The Hardy space H2(R) is equal to F \u2217L2(0,\u221e), so\n[eik\u03c8H2(R)] = Ad(Meik\u03c8F \u2217)M\u03c7(0,\u221e) .\nHere, the multiplication operator Meik\u03c8 is unitary since e\nik\u03c8 is unimod-\nular. In particular, if P = [eik\u03c8H2(R)] then\n\u2016P\u03c7S\u20162 = \u2016(Ad(Meik\u03c8F \u2217)M\u03c7(0,\u221e))\u03c7S\u20162\n= \u2016Meik\u03c8F \u2217(M\u03c7(0,\u221e)FM\u2217eik\u03c8\u03c7S)\u20162 = \u2016\u03c7(0,\u221e)F (e\u2212ik\u03c8\u03c7S)\u20162.\nIt is therefore of interest to find an estimate for the Fourier-Plancherel\ntransform F (e\u2212ik\u03c8\u03c7S) on the positive half-line. This is done in the next\nlemma for admissible functions \u03c8, using an integration by parts in the\nspirit of [17], Chapter VIII.\nLemma 3.3. Let \u03c8 be admissible and let S \u2286 R be a compact interval\nwith non-empty interior S\u25e6 such that \u0393(\u03c8)\u2229S = \u2205 and \u03c8\u2032(S) \u2286 (0,\u221e).\nLet \u2206 be the function \u2206(z) = 2(z+\u03b1)\u22121 where \u03b1 = min{\u03c8\u2032(x) : x \u2208 S}\nand let N = |\u039b(\u03c8) \u2229 S\u25e6|+ 2.

Since \u039b(\u03c8) is discrete, finitely many points in \u039b(\u03c8) lie in the\ninterior of S, say \u03bb2 < \u03bb3 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < \u03bbN\u22121. We also write \u03bb1, \u03bbN for the\nboundary points of S so that S = [\u03bb1, \u03bbN ].

If B is any measurable subset of R then there is a\nsequence of projections Pn = [e\nikn\u03c8nH2(R)] where kn > 0 and each \u03c8n\nis a real-valued function such that sot-limn\u2192\u221e Pn = M\u03c7B .\nProof. Let \u03b5 > 0. By Lemma 3.6, we can find a countable disjoint\nunion of open intervals V\u03b5 such that \u2202V\u03b5 is discrete and m(V\u03b54B) < \u03b5.\nThe function \u03c8\u03b5(x) = x(\u03c7R\\V\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c7V\u03b5) satisfies \u0393(\u03c8\u03b5) \u222a \u039b(\u03c8\u03b5) \u2286 \u2202V\u03b5\nand (\u03c8\u2032\u03b5)\n\u22121(0) = \u2205, so \u03c8\u03b5 is admissible. Let P\u03b5,n = [ein\u03c8\u03b5H2(R)]. By\nTheorem 3.4, sot-limn\u2192\u221e P\u03b5,n = M\u03c7V\u03b5 , and we also have M\u03c7V\u03b5 \u2192M\u03c7B\nstrongly as \u03b5\u2192 0.\nLet d be a metric inducing the strong operator topology on the\nunit ball of B(L2(R)) and let n \u2208 N. Choose \u03b5n > 0 such that\nd(M\u03c7V\u03b5n ,M\u03c7B) < 1\/2n and then choose k \u2208 N so that Pn := P\u03b5n,k\nsatisfies d(Pn,M\u03c7V\u03b5n ) < 1\/2n. Now d(Pn,M\u03c7B) < 1\/n so Pn \u2192 M\u03c7B\nstrongly as n\u2192\u221e. \u0003\n12 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\n4. Closures of Beurling subspace manifolds\nWe now obtain sufficient conditions under which Beurling subspace\nmanifolds M(S) have closures, in the strong operator topology, which\nare compact. Using this we construct various n-spheres and n-balls in\nProj(L2(R)). At the end of the section we pose some further lines of\nenquiry.\nLet f = (f1, f2, . . . , fn) be an n-tuple of functions fj : R \u2192 R. We\nwrite \u3008f, \u03bb\u3009 = \u03bb1f1 + \u03bb2f2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03bbnfn for \u03bb \u2208 Rn, and\nSf = {\u3008f, \u03bb\u3009 : \u03bb \u2208 Rn}.\nDefinition 4.1. The n-tuple f is admissible if\n(i) the set {f1, f2, . . . , fn} is linearly independent over R;\n(ii) every nonzero function in Sf is admissible; and\n(iii) supg\u2208Sf\\{0} |K \u2229 \u039b(g)| <\u221e for each compact set K \u2286 R.\nWe will also write \u0393(f) =\n\u22c3n\nj=1 \u0393(fj) and remark that this is equal to\u22c3\ng\u2208Sf \u0393(g) and is plainly discrete.\nGiven an admissible n-tuple f , let \u03b8 : Rn \u2192 Proj(L2(R)) be the\nmap \u03bb 7\u2192 [ei\u3008f,\u03bb\u3009H2(R)]. Observe that \u03b8 is strongly continuous, since\nif \u03bb(k) \u2192 \u03bb in Rn then \u3008f, \u03bb(k)\u3009 \u2192 \u3008f, \u03bb\u3009 uniformly on compact subsets\nof R \\ \u0393(f) and so\n\u03b8(\u03bb(k)) = Ad(M\nei\u3008f,\u03bb(k)\u3009)[H\n2(R)] sot\u2192 Ad(Mei\u3008f,\u03bb\u3009)[H2(R)] = \u03b8(\u03bb)\nas k \u2192\u221e.\nWe write M(Sf ) = \u03b8(Rn). We will shortly see that M(Sf ) is a\nBeurling subspace manifold.\nTheorem 4.2. Given an admissible n-tuple f , the closure of the range\nof \u03b8 in the strong operator topology is\nM(Sf ) = \u03b8(Rn) \u222a\n{\n[L2\n(\n(\u03c8\u2032)\u22121((\u2212\u221e, 0)))] : \u03c8 \u2208 Sf \\ {0}}.\nProof. Let \u03bb(k) be a sequence in Rn and let Pk = \u03b8(\u03bb(k)) be the corre-\nsponding sequence of projections. Passing to a subsequence, we may\nassume that \u03bb(k) converges to a vector \u03bb \u2208 (R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e})n as k \u2192 \u221e.\nIf \u03bb actually lies in Rn then Pk \u2192 \u03b8(\u03bb) by the continuity of \u03b8. Other-\nwise, if \u03b1k = maxj |\u03bb(k)j | then \u03b1k \u2192 \u221e as k \u2192 \u221e. Let \u00b5(k) = \u03b1\u22121k \u03bb(k).\nPassing to a subsequence, we may assume that \u03b1k = |\u03bb(k)j0 | for some\nj0 independent of k, and that \u00b5\n(k) \u2192 \u00b5 for some \u00b5 \u2208 [\u22121, 1]n. Since\n\u00b5j0 = \u00b11, this limit \u00b5 is nonzero. Now Pk = [ei\u03b1k\u03c8kH2(R)] where\n\u03c8k = \u3008fk, \u00b5(k)\u3009, and if \u03c8 = \u3008f, \u00b5\u3009 then \u03c8\u2032k \u2192 \u03c8\u2032 uniformly on compact\nsubsets of R \\ \u0393(f). By Corollary 3.5, Pk \u2192 [L2((\u03c8\u2032)\u22121((\u2212\u221e, 0)))].\nConversely, if \u03c8 \u2208 Sf \\ {0} then by Theorem 3.4,\n[L2\n(\n(\u03c8\u2032)\u22121((\u2212\u221e, 0)))] = sot-lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n[ein\u03c8H2(R)] \u2208M(Sf ). \u0003\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 13\nDefinition 4.3. Given an admissible n-tuple f , let \u223c be the equiva-\nlence relation defined on Bn by \u03bb \u223c \u00b5 if \u03bb = \u00b5 or\n\u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 Sn\u22121 and m({x : \u3008f \u2032, \u03bb\u3009(x) > 0}4 {x : \u3008f \u2032, \u00b5\u3009(x) > 0}) = 0.\nHere f \u2032 = (f \u20321, . . . , f\n\u2032\nn) and m is Lebesgue measure on R. We write\nBn\/\u223c for the corresponding topological quotient space.\nProposition 4.4. The topological space Bn\/\u223c is homeomorphic to\nM =M(Sf ). In particular, M is compact.\nProof. Let \u03b8 be the continuous map Rn \u2192M defined above. Observe\nthat \u03b8 is injective: for \u03b8(\u03bb) = \u03b8(\u00b5) if and only if ei\u3008f,\u03bb\u2212\u00b5\u3009H2(R) = H2(R)\nwhich implies that the function g = \u3008f, \u03bb \u2212 \u00b5\u3009 is constant modulo\n2pi almost everywhere, so g cannot be admissible. Since g \u2208 Sf , we\nconclude that g = 0; by linear independence, \u03bb = \u00b5.\nLet \u03b1 : Rn \u2192 Bn be a homeomorphism of the form\n\u03b1 : \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03c1(\u2016\u03bb\u2016)\u03bb\u2016\u03bb\u2016\u22121\nwhere \u03c1 : [0,\u221e) \u2192 [0, 1) is a homeomorphism. Consider the injective\ncontinuous map \u03d5 = \u03b8\u25e6\u03b1\u22121 : Bn \u2192M. We extend this to Bn by defin-\ning \u03d5(\u03bb) = limr\u21911 \u03d5(r\u03bb) for \u03bb \u2208 Sn\u22121; this limit exists by Theorem 3.4.\nThe extended map is also continuous by Corollary 3.5 and surjective\nby Theorem 4.2. Since \u03d5(\u03bb) = \u03d5(\u00b5) if and only if \u03bb \u223c \u00b5, it follows that\n\u03d5 induces a homeomorphism from the compact space Bn\/\u223c onto the\nHausdorff space M. \u0003\nRemark 4.5. This proof shows that \u03b8 : Rn \u2192 M(Sf ) is a homeo-\nmorphism when f is admissible, and so M(Sf ) is indeed a Beurling\nsubspace manifold.\nDetermining the precise nature of the quotient space Bn\/\u223c seems\ndifficult in general. However, Proposition 4.8 below shows that there\nare no surprises when n = 2.\nLemma 4.6. Let I be any set of closed, pairwise disjoint intervals,\neach contained in (0, 1). There exists a continuous non-decreasing sur-\njection \u03b2 : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] such that \u03b2(x) = \u03b2(y) if and only if x, y \u2208 I\nfor some I \u2208 I.\nProof. We may assume without loss of generality that each I \u2208 I is\nof the form I = [a, b] with 0 < a < b < 1. Observe that I must be\ncountable since for each n \u2265 1, the set {[a, b] \u2208 I : b \u2212 a > n\u22121} is\nfinite. Enumerate I in decreasing size, so that I = {I1, I2, . . . } where\n|In| \u2265 |In+1| for n \u2265 1. Assign values an on In to create a partially\ndefined increasing function \u03b21 on\n\u22c3 I as follows. Set \u03b21(0) = 0 and\n\u03b21(1) = 1. Then set a1 =\n1\n2\nand a2 =\n1\n4\nor 3\n4\n, according to whether the\nnew interval a2 is to the left or the right of a1. Continue \u201cinterpolating\ndyadically\u201d in this way, so that an+1 is chosen as the mean of \u03b21(`)\n14 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nand \u03b21(r) where ` (respectively, r) is the point of {0, 1} \u222a I1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a In\nimmediately to the left (respectively, right) of In+1.\nLetK be the closure in [0, 1] of {0, 1}\u222a\u22c3 I. Let U be the complement\nof K, an open set in [0, 1] and thus a union of open intervals, which we\ncall \u201cgaps\u201d. We call a gap \u201cgood\u201d if it is of the form J = (b, a\u2032) where\nIn = [a, b] and Im = [a\n\u2032, b\u2032] are intervals in I, and \u201cbad\u201d otherwise. We\ncan extend \u03b21 to a good gap J by linear interpolation between an and\nam. On the other hand, a bad gap J\n\u2032 must have at least one of its end\npoints a limit of endpoints of intervals I \u2208 I, so \u03b21 can be extended\nto the closure J \u2032 as a non-decreasing function in a unique way, namely\nby being constant on J \u2032. So we get a continuous increasing function \u03b21\ndefined on [0, 1]. We now correct the constancy on the intervals J \u2032 by\nforming \u03b23 = \u03b21 + \u03b22 where\n\u03b22 =\n\u2211\nbad J \u2032\n\u03b2J \u2032\nand \u03b2J \u2032 is the continuous map on [0, 1] which takes the value 0 to the\nleft of J \u2032, the value |J \u2032| to the right and is linear on J \u2032. (None of these\n\u03b2J \u2032 spoil constancy on the In.) Continuity of \u03b23 is clear. Finally, let\n\u03b2 = c\u03b23 with c = (1 +\n\u2211\nbad J \u2032 |J \u2032|)\u22121 so that \u03b2(1) = 1. \u0003\nLemma 4.7. Let I be a set of closed, pairwise disjoint proper arcs in\nT. Then D\/I is homeomorphic to D.\nProof. We may assume that (1, 0) does not belong to any set in I.\nTransfer I to [0, 1] in the obvious manner and apply the previous lemma\nto obtain an increasing continuous surjection \u03b2 : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] such\nthat \u03b2(x) = \u03b2(y) if and only if {e2piix, e2piiy} \u2286 I for some I \u2208 I. The\nmap \u03d5 : D \u2192 D given by \u03d5(re2piix) = re2pii(r\u03b2(x)+(1\u2212r)x) for r, x \u2208 (0, 1]\nand \u03d5(0) = 0 induces a continuous bijection D\/I \u2192 D, which is a\nhomeomorphism since D\/I is compact. \u0003\nProposition 4.8. For every admissible pair (f, g), the closure in the\nstrong operator topology of the Beurling subspace manifoldM(S(f,g)) is\nhomeomorphic to D.\nProof. Let \u223c be the equivalence relation on D of Definition 4.3, with\nequivalence classes {[\u03bb] : \u03bb \u2208 D}. Observe that \u03bb 6\u223c \u2212\u03bb and \u03bb \u223c \u00b5 if\nand only if \u2212\u03bb \u223c \u2212\u00b5. Also, the equivalence classes are connected: if\n\u03bb \u223c \u00b5 then the shorter of the two arcs joining \u03bb to \u00b5 is contained in\n[\u03bb] = [\u00b5].\nWe show that the equivalence classes are also closed. If there is a\nnon-trivial equivalence class then we can make a different choice of f\nand g without changing the set S(f,g) to arrange that (1, 0) \u223c (0,\u22121),\nand so also that (\u22121, 0) \u223c (0, 1). Any remaining equivalence classes\nare of the form [\u03bb] where \u03bb = (\u03bb1, \u03bb2) with \u03bb1\u03bb2 > 0; we may assume\nthat \u03bb1 > 0 and \u03bb2 > 0. Let h = g\n\u2032\/f \u2032 and let \u03b1 = \u2212\u03bb1\/\u03bb2. Then\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 15\n[\u03bb] = [\u03bb]+ \u2229 [\u03bb]\u2212 where\n[\u03bb]+ =\n{\n\u00b5 : {f \u2032 > 0} \u2229 ({h > \u03b1}4 {h > \u2212\u00b51\/\u00b52}) is null} and\n[\u03bb]\u2212 =\n{\n\u00b5 : {f \u2032 < 0} \u2229 ({h < \u03b1}4 {h < \u2212\u00b51\/\u00b52}) is null}.\nHere and below we employ abbreviations of the form {P (\u03d5)} to mean\nthe set {x \u2208 R : P (\u03d5(x))} where \u03d5 : R \u2192 R and P is a predicate\ndepending on a real parameter.\nNote that for any constant k, the set {x : h(x) = k} is null; for if\nnot, then f \u2032 \u2212 kg\u2032 takes the value 0 on a non-null set, so f \u2212 kg is\nnot admissible, whence f = kg; but f and g are independent. For\n\u03b3 > 0, let u\u03b3 be the unit vector (\u03b3, 1)\/(\u03b3\n2 + 1)1\/2. Each [\u03bb]+ is clearly\nconnected. It is also closed, for if b > a > 0 and {u\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 (a, b)} \u2286 [\u03bb]+\nthen {\u03b1 < h \u2264 \u2212b} \u2229 {f \u2032 > 0} is equal to the union of the null sets\n{f \u2032 > 0, h = \u2212b} and \u22c3n\u22651{\u03b1 < h \u2264 \u2212b\u2212 n\u22121} \u2229 {f \u2032 > 0}, so is null;\nhence ub, and by a similar argument ua, lie in [\u03bb]+. The class [\u03bb]\u2212 is\nclosed for the same reasons, and hence each class [\u03bb] is a closed subarc\nof T. Now Proposition 4.4 and Lemma 4.7 complete the proof. \u0003\nGiven an admissible n-tuple f , let \u03a3(Sf ) denote the complement\ncompletion of M(Sf ); that is, the closure of M(Sf ) \u222aM(Sf )\u22a5 in the\nstrong operator topology. It is not hard to see thatM(Sf ) andM(Sf )\u22a5\nare disjoint, and the boundaries of these sets are equal by Theorem 4.2.\nFrom this it follows that provided M(Sf ) is homeomorphic to Bn, the\nset \u03a3(Sf ) is homeomorphic to Sn since it is homeomorphic to the union\nof two copies of Bn joined at their boundaries.\nRecall that if f \u2208 H2(R) and f 6= 0 then f\u22121(0) has Lebesgue\nmeasure zero (see Theorem 6.13 of [4] and Corollary 6.4.2 of [13]).\nThis will be used several times below, where we refer to the result as\nthe F. & M. Riesz theorem.\nWe also remind the reader that if H is a Hilbert space then the oper-\nations of closed linear span and intersection of closed subspaces impose\na natural lattice structure on Proj(H). The corresponding partial or-\nder is simply [K1] \u2264 [K2] \u21d0\u21d2 K1 \u2286 K2 for closed subspaces Ki \u2286 H.\nA nest is a chain in Proj(H) containing 0 and I which is complete with\nrespect to these lattice operations [3]. A nest is said to be continuous\nif it contains no element with an immediate predecessor in the nest.\nExample 4.9. The Fourier-Plancherel sphere is the set of projections\n\u03a3FP = \u03a3(Sf ) where f is the admissible pair f = (x, x2).\nBy Proposition 4.8 or the direct arguments of [7], we see thatM(Sf ) is\nhomeomorphic to D, and as observed in [8], the order structure of \u03a3FP\nis that of a union of continuous nests which meet only at 0 and I and\n\u03a3FP is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere on which the Fourier-Plancherel\ntransform F acts as a quarter-rotation. In particular, \u03a3FP \\ {0, I} is\na locally unitary subspace manifold: we clearly have a locally unitary\n16 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nstructure on M(Sf ) \u222a M(Sf )\u22a5, and we can use F to transfer this\nstructure to the remaining subspaces.\nExample 4.10. Let f be the admissible pair f = (x\u22121, x). An easy\nextension of [8], Lemma 5.1 shows that every projection P \u2208 M(Sf )\nlies in a continuum of non-commuting continuous nests which intersect\nonly in {0, P, I}. A simple calculation reveals that the equivalence\nrelation \u223c has only two non-trivial equivalence classes and these are\nantipodal closed quarter-circles, so B2\/\u223c is homeomorphic to B2 and\nthe boundary projections are\n{P, P\u22a5 : P = [L2((\u2212a, a))], a \u2208 [0,\u221e]}.\nNow although \u03a3(Sf ) is homeomorphic to a 2-sphere, \u03a3(Sf ) \\ {0, I}\nis not locally unitary. For if there were a strong operator topology\nneighbourhood of P0 = [L\n2((\u2212a, a))] of the form\nN = {[\u03c1(\u03bb)P0L2(R)] : \u03bb \u2208 B2}\nfor some unitary-valued representation \u03c1 of R2, then N would inter-\nsect M(Sf ) and so contain a projection P = [\u03c1(\u03bb)P0L2(R)] for some\npoint \u03bb \u2208 B2 such that every neighbourhood of P contains two non-\ncommuting projections which are comparable with P . Applying \u03c1(\u2212\u03bb),\nwe see that N must contain two non-commuting projections which are\ncomparable with P0. However, all the projections in \u03a3(Sf ) which are\ncomparable with P0 commute since by the F. & M. Riesz theorem, they\nare of the form [L2(E)] for some E \u2286 R.\nExample 4.11. If we take f = (1\n3\nx3, 1\n2\nx2, x) then f \u2032 = (x2, x, 1) and it\nis not hard to check that the corresponding equivalence relation \u223c on\nB3 has two non-trivial equivalence classes:\n{(0, 0, 1)} \u222a {(a, b, c) \u2208 S2 : b2 \u2264 4ac, a > 0} and\n{(0, 0,\u22121)} \u222a {(a, b, c) \u2208 S2 : b2 \u2264 4ac, a < 0}\nwhich correspond to 0 and I respectively when we identify the quotient\nspace B3\/\u223c with M(Sf ). These equivalence classes are closed and so\nM(Sf ) is homeomorphic to B3. If P is a projection in M(Sf ) then\nwe claim that the projections [eikxPL2(R)] for k \u2208 R are the only\nnon-trivial elements of M(Sf ) which are comparable with P . To see\nthis, recall that no proper subspace of the form L2(E) is comparable\nwith PL2(R) by the F. & M. Riesz theorem, and if ei\u3008f,\u03bb\u3009H2(R) \u2286\nei\u3008f,\u00b5\u3009H2(R) and \u03bb 6= \u00b5 then ei\u3008f,\u03bb\u2212\u00b5\u3009H2(R) \u2286 H2(R) and so ei\u3008f,\u03bb\u2212\u00b5\u3009 is\na nonzero continuous inner function. This must be of the form \u03b1ei\u03b2x for\na unimodular constant \u03b1 and \u03b2 \u2208 R (see [6]), which verifies the claim.\nOn the other hand, the boundary ofM(Sf ) consists of the projections\n[L2(E)] where E is either an interval or the complement of an interval.\nAs in the previous example, it follows that the topological 3-sphere\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 17\n\u03a3(Sf ) cannot be locally unitary away from {0, I} since the local order\nstructure changes on the boundary of M(Sf ).\nExample 4.12. Let f = (x, log |x|,\u2212x\u22121). Then f \u2032 = (1, x\u22121, x\u22122) so\nif \u03bb = (a, b, c) then sgn\u3008f \u2032, \u03bb\u3009 = sgn(ax2 + bx+ c). The equivalence re-\nlation for f on B3 is therefore identical to the relation considered in the\nprevious example, and M(Sf ) is again homeomorphic to B3. The or-\nder structure differs however, sinceM(Sf ) contains the setM(S(x,x\u22121))\nfrom Example 4.10. We call the set \u03a3hyp = \u03a3(Sf ) the hyperbolic sphere.\nThis was first considered in [8], Section 7. We remark that as in Ex-\nample 4.10, \u03a3hyp \\ {0, I} cannot be locally unitary.\nWe can now easily establish the compactness of the \u201cextended hy-\nperbolic lattice\u201d L\u02c6 considered in [8]; this fact was alluded to but not\nproven there. For \u03b8 \u2208 T, let u\u03b8 : R \u2192 C be the two-valued func-\ntion taking the value 1 on [0,\u221e) and \u03b8 on (\u2212\u221e, 0). Then L\u02c6 may be\nsuccinctly described as the set of projections\nL\u02c6 =\n\u22c3\n\u03b8\u2208T\nAd(Mu\u03b8)\u03a3hyp.\nNow \u03a3hyp is homeomorphic to the compact space S\n3 and L\u02c6 is a con-\ntinuous image of T\u00d7 \u03a3hyp which is compact, so L\u02c6 is also compact.\nExample 4.13. The equivalence relation \u223c need not have a finite\nnumber of nontrivial equivalence classes. For example, consider the\nadmissible triple f = (1\n2\nx2, log |x|,\u2212x\u22121) so that if \u03bb = (a, b, c) then\nsgn\u3008f \u2032, \u03bb\u3009 = sgn(ax3 + bx + c). A simple analysis of cases reveals\nthat the nontrivial equivalence classes for \u223c in the upper hemisphere\n{(a, b, c) \u2208 S2 : a \u2265 0} are\nIt = {\u03bb\/\u2016\u03bb\u2016 : \u03bb = (1, s,\u2212t(s+ t2)), s \u2265 \u22123t2\/4} \u222a {\u00b5t}, t \u2208 R\nwhere \u00b5t = (1 + t\n2)\u22121\/2(0, 1,\u2212t). The class It corresponds to the pro-\njection [L2(\u2212\u221e, t)] \u2208M(Sf ). Since points of the form (1, s,\u2212t(s+ t2))\nfor s \u2208 R form a straight line in the plane {(1, b, c) : b, c \u2208 R}\nit follows that It is the geodesic on S\n2 joining \u03bbt\/\u2016\u03bbt\u2016 to \u00b5t where\n\u03bbt = (1,\u22123t2\/4,\u2212t3\/4). In the a \u2264 0 hemisphere the nontrivial equiv-\nalence classes are the sets \u2212It which correspond to [L2(t,\u221e)]. It is easy\nto see that the quotient space B3\/\u223c is homeomorphic to B3; indeed,\nwe may choose a homeomorphism which contracts each geodesic It to\nthe point \u00b5t and extend this to all of B3 is a straightforward manner.\nWe again conclude that M(Sf ) is homeomorphic to B3.\nRemark 4.14. We do not know if M(Sf ), or equivalently Bn\/\u223c, is\nhomeomorphic to Bn for every admissible n-tuple f . It is natural to try\nto emulate the argument of Proposition 4.8, and it is not hard to show\nthat the equivalence classes [\u03bb] of \u223c satisfy the following conditions:\n(i) [\u03bb] = {\u03bb} if \u03bb \u2208 Bn;\n18 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\n(ii) [\u2212\u03bb] = \u2212[\u03bb] and [\u2212\u03bb] \u2229 [\u03bb] = \u2205 for \u03bb \u2208 Sn\u22121;\n(iii) if \u03bb \u223c \u00b5 then \u03bb \u223c \u03bd for every \u03bd on the geodesic in Sn\u22121 joining\n\u03bb to \u00b5; and\n(iv) if \u03bbn \u223c \u00b5n where \u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb and \u00b5n \u2192 \u00b5 are convergent se-\nquences in Sn\u22121, then \u03bb \u223c \u00b5.\nHowever, for n > 2 we have been unable to identify the quotient space\nBn\/\u223c for such an equivalence relation.\nRemark 4.15. The order structure of the 2-sphere \u03a3FP and the 3-\nsphere \u03a3hyp can be viewed as providing an inherent foliation. We ex-\nploit this structure in the next section in the determination of their\nunitary automorphism groups. On the other hand we see in Lemma 5.8\nthat the 2-spheres determined by monomial pairs xp, xq, for |p|, |q| > 1\nhave a trivial order structure supported in the common boundary of\nM and M\u22a5.\nThe Fourier-Plancherel sphere seems to be a particularly distin-\nguished example amongst these 2-spheres. Furthermore its equator, \u03a3e\nyields an interesting compact 1-dimensional subspace manifold which is\nlocally unitary and is probably not (periodically) unitary. It would be\ninteresting to determine other (unitarily inequivalent) subspace mani-\nfolds of this form.\n5. Unitary automorphisms and isomorphisms\nGiven a set of projections P \u2286 Proj(H), the unitary automorphism\ngroup of P is\nU(P) = {U \u2208 Unit(H) : (AdU)P = P}.\nIn this section we compute the unitary automorphism groups of the\nFourier-Plancherel sphere, the hyperbolic sphere and the extended hy-\nperbolic lattice. These projection manifolds inherit a relatively rich\norder structure from Proj(L2(R)) which we are able to exploit. In con-\ntrast we show in Section 5.3 that many other polynomial 2-spheres\nare essentially rigid. Further operator algebra related to the two main\nexamples can be found in [15], [16], [12].\n5.1. The Fourier-Plancherel sphere. Recall the definition of the\nFourier-Plancherel sphere \u03a3FP from Example 4.9. The following nota-\ntion from [7] is convenient:\n\u03d5s \u2208 L\u221e(R), \u03d5s(x) = e\u2212isx2\/2, s \u2208 R,\nVt \u2208 Unit(L2(R)), Vtf(x) = et\/2f(etx), t \u2208 R.\nThe set \u03a3FP contains two nests of particular interest, which we call the\nanalytic nest\nNa = {[Mei\u03bbxH2(R)] : \u03bb \u2208 R} \u222a {0, I}\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 19\nI\n0\n\u03a3a\n\u03a3e\nH2(R)\nH2(R)\n\u03bb\ns L\n2(R+)\nL2(R\u2212)\nF\nFigure 1.

We first show that Vt may be expressed solely in\nterms of {M\u03d5s : s \u2208 R} and F .\n20 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nLemma 5.1. For t \u2208 R, the dilation operator Vt lies in the group\ngenerated by {M\u03d5s , F, ei\u03c8I : s, \u03c8 \u2208 R}. In fact,\nVt = e\nipi\/4M\u03d5exp(t)FM\u03d5exp(\u2212t)FM\u03d5exp(t)F.\nProof. Let us write Sg for the operation of convolution with a function\ng \u2208 L\u221e(R), defined on the Schwartz space S(R); that is,\nSgf(x) =\n\u222b\nR\ng(x\u2212 t)f(t) dt, f \u2208 S(R), x \u2208 R.\nFor \u03b6 \u2208 C \\ R\u2212, let \u03b6\u00b11\/2 denote the square root of \u03b6\u00b11 with non-\nnegative real part. Let F\u02dc be the alternate Fourier transform defined\non S(R) by\nF\u02dc f(x) =\n\u222b\nR\nf(y)e\u22122piixy dy, f \u2208 S(R), x \u2208 R.\nObserve that F\u02dc = Vlog 2piF |S(R) and that VtM\u03d5s = M\u03d5e2tsVt.\nIn Section XI.1 of [9] it is shown that\nF\u02dcS\u03d52pib = (ib)\n\u22121\/2M\u03d5\u22122pi\/bF\u02dc , b \u2208 R \\ {0},\nor, writing s = 2pib and rearranging,\nS\u03d5sf = (2pi\/is)\n1\/2F \u2217M\u03d5\u22121\/sFf, f \u2208 S(R), s \u2208 R \\ {0}.\nObserve that \u03d5s(x \u2212 t) = eisxt\u03d5s(x)\u03d5s(t) for x, s, t \u2208 R. Hence for\nx \u2208 R, s < 0 and f \u2208 S(R),\nS\u03d5sf(x) =\n\u222b\nR\n\u03d5s(x\u2212 t)f(t) dt\n= \u03d5s(x)\n\u222b\nR\neisxt\u03d5s(t)f(t) dt\n= (2pi)1\/2\u03d5s(x)(F\n\u2217M\u03d5sf)(sx)\n=\n(\n2pi\/(\u2212s))1\/2M\u03d5sVlog(\u2212s)FM\u03d5sf(x).\nEquating these expressions for S\u03d5sf and using the density of S(R) in\nL2(R) gives\nVlog(\u2212s) = eipi\/4M\u03d5\u2212sF\n\u2217M\u03d5\u22121\/sFM\u03d5\u2212sF\n\u2217.\nNow F \u2217 = F 3 and F 2 commutes with M\u03d5\u03c3 for any \u03c3 \u2208 R, since \u03d5\u03c3 is\neven and F 2f(x) = f(\u2212x). So\nFM\u03d5\u03c3F\n\u2217 = F \u2217M\u03d5\u03c3F and F\n\u2217M\u03d5\u03c3F\n\u2217 = FM\u03d5\u03c3F.\nUsing this and setting t = log(\u2212s) completes the proof. \u0003\nTheorem 5.2. The unitary automorphism group of \u03a3FP is generated\nby\n{M\u03d5s ,Mei\u03bbx , F, ei\u03c8I : s, \u03bb, \u03c8 \u2208 R}.\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 21\nProof. Let U \u2208 U(\u03a3FP) and let \u03a3a, \u03a3v and \u03a3s denote the \u201cgreat circles\u201d\n\u03a3a = Na \u222aN\u22a5a , \u03a3v = Nv \u222aN\u22a5v , \u03a3s = Ns \u222aN\u22a5s for s \u2208 R.\nThe map AdU preserves orthogonality and the order structure on \u03a3FP,\nso it must permute these great circles. If (AdU)\u03a3a = \u03a3v, then AdFU\nfixes \u03a3a; if (AdU)\u03a3a = \u03a3s for some s \u2208 R, then M\u03d5\u2212sU fixes \u03a3a. So\nwe may assume that (AdU)\u03a3a = \u03a3a.\nIf (AdU)\u03a3v 6= \u03a3v, then (AdU)\u03a3v = \u03a3s for some s 6= 0. If s > 0 then\nby (1), (AdF )\u03a3s = \u03a3\u22121\/s and (AdF )\u03a3a = \u03a3v, so U \u2032 = F \u2217M\u03d51\/sFU\nsatisfies (AdU \u2032)\u03a3a = \u03a3a and (AdU \u2032)\u03a3v = \u03a3v. So we may assume that\n(AdU)\u03a3v = \u03a3v and (AdU)\u03a3a = \u03a3a.\nThere are now four cases to consider:\n(i) (AdU)Na = Na, (AdU)Nv = Nv;\n(ii) (AdU)Na = N\u22a5a , (AdU)Nv = N\u22a5v ;\n(iii) (AdU)Na = N\u22a5a , (AdU)Nv = Nv;\n(iv) (AdU)Na = Na, (AdU)Nv = N\u22a5v .\nReplacing U with F 2U interchanges cases (i) and (ii) and also inter-\nchanges cases (iii) and (iv), so it suffices to consider cases (i) and (iii)\nonly.\nSuppose that case (iii) holds. We claim that (AdU)N1 = N\u22a5\u2212s for\nsome s > 0. To see this, let N be the set of nests\nN = {Nv,N\u22a5v } \u222a {Ns,N\u22a5s : s \u2208 R}\nso that \u03a3FP is the union of all nests in N. Since U is unitary, it maps\nnests onto nests and so induces a bijection of N.\nLet \u03a3e be the \u201cequator\u201d of \u03a3FP,\n\u03a3e = {L2(R+), L2(R\u2212)} \u222a {M\u03d5sH2(R),M\u03d5sH2(R) : s \u2208 R}.\nHere H2(R) is the set of complex conjugates of functions in H2(R),\nwhich is equal toH2(R)\u22a5 [13]. The set \u03a3e contains exactly one subspace\nfrom each nest in N, so the action (AdU) : \u03a3e \u2192 (AdU)\u03a3e, K 7\u2192\n(AdU)K of AdU on \u03a3e determines the action of AdU onN. Moreover,\nAdU is a homeomorphism between \u03a3e and (AdU)\u03a3e, and \u03a3e is itself\nhomeomorphic to the circle T. Let us give N the topology induced\nby the topology on \u03a3e. The bijective action of AdU on N is then a\nhomeomorphism.\nIt follows that the closed connected set\n[Na,Nv] =\n\u22c3\ns\u22650\nNs \u222aNv\n22 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nmust be mapped by AdU onto\neither [N\u22a5a ,Nv] =\n\u22c3\ns\u22650\nN\u22a5s \u222aN\u22a5v \u222a\n\u22c3\ns\u2208R\nNs \u222aNv\nor [Nv,N\u22a5a ] = Nv \u222a\n\u22c3\ns\u22640\nN\u22a5s .\nIf (AdU)[Na,Nv] = [N\u22a5a ,Nv] then there is some s > 0 such that\n(AdU)Ns = N\u22a5v . Since (AdU)Nv = Nv and U is unitary,\nN\u22a5v = ((AdU\u2217)Nv)\u22a5 = (AdU\u2217)N\u22a5v = Ns,\nwhich is impossible by the F. & M. Riesz theorem.\nSo (AdU)[Na,Nv] = [Nv,N\u22a5a ] and so (AdU)N1 = N\u22a5\u2212s for some\ns > 0. Since (AdU)Nv = Nv, it follows from [3], Chapter 17 that there\nexist a unimodular function \u03b1 \u2208 L\u221e(R) and an order-preserving almost\neverywhere differentiable bijection g : R \u2192 R such that U = M\u03b1Cg\nwhere Cg is the unitary composition operator corresponding to g. Thus\nUM\u03d51H\n2(R) = M\u03b1CgM\u03d51H2(R) = M\u03d5\u2212sMei\u03bbxH2(R)\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 R. Moreover, (AdU)Na = N\u22a5a , so UH2(R) = Mei\u00b5xH2(R)\nfor some \u00b5 \u2208 R. Since CgMf = Mf\u25e6gCg for f \u2208 L\u221e(R),\nM\u03d51\u25e6gM\u03b1CgH\n2(R) = M\u03d51\u25e6gMei\u00b5xH2(R) = M\u03d5\u2212sMei\u03bbxH2(R).\nTaking orthogonal complements, we see that\nM\u03d5sMe\u2212i\u03bbxM\u03d51\u25e6gMei\u00b5xH\n2(R) = uH2(R) = H2(R),\nwhere u : R\u2192 C is the unimodular function\nx 7\u2192 exp i(\u2212 1\n2\n(g(x)2 + sx2) + (\u00b5\u2212 \u03bb)x).\nSo u must be constant almost everywhere. But s > 0 and g(x) \u2192 \u221e\nas x\u2192\u221e, so this is impossible.\nSo we are reduced to case (i): AdU fixes both the analytic nest and\nthe Volterra nest, and so is a unitary automorphism of Alg(Nv \u222a Na),\nthe Fourier binest algebra. By [7], Lemma 4.1, U = ei\u03c8Mei\u03bbxD\u00b5Vt for\nsome \u03c8, \u03bb, \u00b5, t \u2208 R. Now apply Lemma 5.1. \u0003\nRemark 5.3.

The authors do not know if the same can be said\nfor U(\u03a3FP) itself.\n5.2. The hyperbolic sphere and the extended hyperbolic lat-\ntice. Recall the definitions of the hyperbolic sphere \u03a3hyp and the ex-\ntended hyperbolic lattice L\u02c6 \u2287 \u03a3hyp from Example 4.12. For \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R,\nlet M\u03bb,\u00b5 = Mei(\u03bbx+\u00b5x\u22121) and for (\u03b8, s) \u2208 T\u00d7 R let\nU\u03b8,s = M|x|isu\u03b8(x) where as before, u\u03b8 = \u03c7[0,\u221e) + \u03b8\u03c7(\u2212\u221e,0).\nA typical projection in M(S(x,log |x|,\u2212x\u22121)) is\n[U1,sM\u03bb,\u00b5H\n2(R)] where (s, \u03bb, \u00b5) \u2208 R3.\nIf u\u03b8,s = \u03c7[0,\u221e) + \u03b8espi\u03c7(\u2212\u221e,0) then it is shown in [8] that U\u03b8,sH2(R) =\nMu\u03b8,sH\n2(R) for (\u03b8, s) \u2208 T\u00d7 R. We further define operators\nJ1f(x) = x\n\u22121f(\u2212x\u22121) and J2f(x) = f(\u2212x), f \u2208 L2(R);\nthese are the unitary composition operators corresponding to the sym-\nmetries x 7\u2192 \u2212x\u22121 and x 7\u2192 \u2212x, respectively. The linear span of the\nset of functions z 7\u2192 (z \u2212 \u03be)\u22121 for =\u03be < 0 (or =\u03be > 0) is dense in\nH2(R) (or in H2(R), respectively). Applying J1 and J2 to these sets\nreveals that J1H\n2(R) = H2(R) and J2H2(R) = H2(R). It is easy to\nsee that all of these operators are unitary automorphisms of L\u02c6, and\nif we fix \u03b8 = 1 then we obtain unitary automorphisms of \u03a3hyp. We\nwill show that in each case, these operators generate the whole unitary\nautomorphism group.\nLemma 5.4. Let \u03b3 be a conformal automorphism of the upper half\nplane H. For each nonzero s \u2208 R, the subspace Mu1,s\u25e6\u03b3H2(R) has zero\nintersection with each subspace in M(S(x,log |x|,\u2212x\u22121)) unless \u03b3 is either\nof the form \u03b3(x) = ax for some a > 0 or \u03b3(x) = \u2212bx\u22121 for some b > 0.\nProof.

(i) We exploit the order structure of L\u02c6, given in Proposition 5.2\nof [8]. Suppose that U lies in U(L\u02c6), the unitary automorphism group\nof L\u02c6. Let us write M for the set\nM =M(S(x,log |x|,\u2212x\u22121)) = {Ad(U1,sM\u03bb,\u00b5)[H2(R)] : s, \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R}\nand let \u2202M be the topological boundary ofM, which by Theorem 4.2\nis the set of projections in L\u02c6 of the form [L2(E)]. Observe first that\n\u2202M must be mapped onto itself by AdU . This will follow if we can\nshow that the set L\u02c6\\\u2202M may be intrinsically described as the union of\nall non-commutative sublattices of L\u02c6 which are order-isomorphic to the\nslice L1,0 = {Ad(M\u03bb,\u00b5)[H2(R)] : \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R} and whose closure contains\n{0, I}. Writing\nL\u03b8,s = {Ad(U\u03b8,sM\u03bb,\u00b5)[H2(R)] : \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R}\nfor (\u03b8, s) \u2208 T \u00d7 R, observe that each of the slices L\u03b8,s, L\u22a5\u03b8,s has this\nproperty. Hence this union contains L\u02c6 \\ \u2202M. On the other hand,\nsuppose that L is such a non-commutative sublattice and that P \u2208\n\u2202M\u2229 L. Since L \u223c= L1,0 there are two continuous nests N1,N2 con-\ntained in L\u222a{0, I} which do not commute with one another such that\nN1 \u2229 N2 = {0, P, I}. Now P is of the form P = [L2(E)] and all the\nnon-trivial projections Q,R in L\u02c6 which satisfy Q \u2264 [L2(E)] \u2264 R are\nall contained in \u2202M by the F. & M. Riesz theorem, so N1,N2 \u2286 \u2202M.\nBut all projections in \u2202M commute, so we obtain a contradiction and\n\u2202M\u2229L must be empty.\nHence (AdU)\u2202M = \u2202M. Observe that\nL\u02c6 \\ \u2202M =\n\u22c3\n\u03b8\u2208T\n(AdU\u03b8,1)M\u222a\n\u22c3\n\u03b8\u2208T\n(AdU\u03b8,1)M\u22a5\nand that the terms in this union are the components of L\u02c6 \\ \u2202M, which\nAdU must therefore permute. If UH2(R) = U\u03b8,sM\u03bb,\u00b5H2(R), then we\nmay replace U with J2U to ensure that UH\n2(R) \u2208 \u22c3\u03b8\u2208T(AdU\u03b8,1)M,\nand then replacing U by U\u03b8,sM\u03bb,\u00b5U for suitable \u03b8, s, \u03bb, \u00b5 we can arrange\nthat UH2(R) = H2(R), and so also that (AdU)M =M.\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 25\nTable 1.

Von\nNeumann\u2019s theorem of [20] shows that this is necessarily induced by a\nBorel isomorphism \u03b3. (See also Nordgren [14]). Since L\u221e(R) is max-\nimal abelian it follows readily that U = M\u03d5C\u03b3 for some unimodular\nfunction \u03d5 where C\u03b3 is the unitary composition operator for \u03b3. More-\nover, U induces an automorphism of H\u221e(R), since if h \u2208 H\u221e(R) then\nMhH\n2(R) \u2286 H2(R) and so\nH2(R) = UH2(R) \u2287 UMhH2(R) = M\u03d5C\u03b3MhH2(R)\n= Mh\u25e6\u03b3M\u03d5C\u03b3H2(R)\n= Mh\u25e6\u03b3UH2(R)\n= Mh\u25e6\u03b3H2(R).\nIt follows from the Beurling-Lax theorem [10] that h\u25e6\u03b3 \u2208 H\u221e(R). The\nsame argument applied to U\u2217 shows that the map h 7\u2192 h\u25e6\u03b3 is indeed an\nautomorphism of H\u221e(R). Hence \u03b3 induces a conformal automorphism\nof the upper half plane.\nFix s 6= 0. Since (AdU)M =M, the subspace\nU(U1,sH\n2(R)) = UMu1,sH2(R) = Mu1,s\u25e6\u03b3UH2(R) = Mu1,s\u25e6\u03b3H2(R)\nmust lie inM. By Lemma 5.4, either \u03b3(x) = etx or \u03b3(x) = \u2212(etx)\u22121 for\nsome t \u2208 R. Hence C\u03b3 \u2208 {Vt, J1Vt}. Multiplying by C\u2217\u03b3 reduces to the\ncase U = M\u03d5. Since C\u03b3H\n2(R) = H2(R), we have M\u03d5H2(R) = H2(R)\nand so \u03d5 is constant almost everywhere.\n(ii) Following the first paragraph of the proof of (i) with \u03a3hyp in place\nof L\u02c6, we may assume that U \u2208 U(\u03a3hyp) satisfies (AdU)\u2202M = \u2202M.\nNow \u03a3hyp \\ \u2202M = M\u222aM\u22a5 has two components, which AdU must\npermute.

This can be\neasily computed using the results of Section 4:\nLemma 5.6. Let m > n be nonzero integers and let \u03b1 be the residue\nclass of (m,n) in (Z\/2Z)2, which we identify with {0, 1}\u00d7{0, 1}. Then\n\u2202Mm,n = \u2202M\u03b1 depends only on \u03b1.

Suppose that u(x) = exp(i(\u03b3xm+ \u03b4xn)) is an inner func-\ntion, where n,m are distinct integers and \u03b3, \u03b4 \u2208 R. If \u03b3 6= 0 then\nm \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}, and if \u03b4 6= 0 then n \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}.\nProof. Given h(x) \u2208 H\u221e(R), there is a unique function, \u03b7(z) \u2208 H\u221e(H)\nwhose nontangential limit boundary value function \u03b7? \u2208 H\u221e(R) is\nequal to h almost everywhere. Suppose that \u03ba(z) is analytic on an open\ndisc U with U \u2229 R = (a, b) for some a < b, and that h agrees with \u03ba?\nalmost everywhere on (a, b). Then \u03b7(z) = \u03ba(z) on U \u2229H. Indeed \u03b7 and\n\u03ba both have restrictions in H\u221e(U \u2229 H) and their boundary functions\nagree on a set of positive measure, so the conclusion follows from the\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 27\nF. & M. Riesz theorem together with the Riemann mapping theorem.\n(See also Fisher [5].)\nWe apply this principle to h(x) = exp(i(\u03b3xm+\u03b4xn)). If h is inner and\n\u03b7 \u2208 H\u221e(H) with \u03b7? = h, consider the analytic function \u03ba : C\\{0} \u2192 C,\nz 7\u2192 exp(i(\u03b3zm + \u03b4zn)). Since \u03ba is analytic on each of the open discs U\nwhich meet the right half line and the union of these discs contains H,\nwe conclude that \u03b7 = \u03ba on H. However, it is routine to check that\nthis function is bounded in the upper half plane only under the stated\nconditions. \u0003\nLemma 5.8. Let m,n be distinct integers in Z \\ {\u22121, 0, 1}. If P and\nQ are distinct projections in \u03a3m,n with 0 6= P \u2264 Q 6= I then they must\nlie in \u2202Mm,n.\nProof. Suppose that P 6\u2208 \u2202Mm,n. By the F. & M. Riesz theorem,\nQ 6\u2208 \u2202Mm,n. Suppose without loss of generality that P \u2208Mm,n; if this\nis not the case, then apply the unitary automorphism J2 induced by\nx 7\u2192 \u2212x, which maps M\u22a5m,n onto Mm,n, to make it so. If Q \u2208 M\u22a5m,n\nthen there exist \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bb, \u00b5 \u2208 R such that\nei(\u03bbx\nm+\u00b5xn)H2(R) \u2286 ei(\u03b1xm+\u03b2xn)H2(R),\nwhere these subspaces are the ranges of P and Q, respectively. Let\nu(x) = exp i(\u03b3xm + \u03b4xn) where \u03b3 = \u03bb \u2212 \u03b1 and \u03b4 = \u00b5 \u2212 \u03b2, so that\nuH2(R) \u2286 H2(R). Taking complex conjugates yields uH2(R) \u2286 H2(R),\nso H2(R) \u2286 uH2(R) and thus uH2(R) = H2(R). So\nH2(R) = (H2(R))\u22a5 = (uH2(R))\u22a5 = uH2(R) = u2H2(R).\nIt is well-known that a unimodular function which preserves H2(R)\nmust be constant almost everywhere, so \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0, which would imply\nthat H2(R) = H2(R), an obvious contradiction.\nSo Q \u2208Mm,n, say\nP = [ei(\u03bbx\nm+\u00b5xn)H2(R)], Q = [ei(\u03b1xm+\u03b2xn)H2(R)].\nNow u(x) = exp i(\u03b3xm + \u03b4xn) leaves H2(R) invariant, so is an inner\nfunction. Hence \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0 by Lemma 5.7 and P = Q, a contradiction.\nSo P \u2208 \u2202Mm,n, hence Q \u2208 \u2202Mm,n by the F. & M. Riesz theorem.\n\u0003\nThe conclusion of Lemma 5.8 holds nontrivially precisely when m,n\nare not both even and it follows that the boundary \u2202Mm,n is a uni-\ntary invariant for \u03a3m,n and also for the balls Mm,n. Furthermore,\nLemma 5.6 shows that \u2202Mm,n generates L\u221e(R) precisely when m,n\nare not both odd. When both these conditions prevail we can classify\nthe spheres and balls by an argument similar to that of Theorem 5.5.\nIn fact we expect that a somewhat deeper analysis will show that in\ngeneral the (unordered) set{{m,n}, {\u2212m,\u2212n}}\n28 R.H.LEVENE AND S.C.POWER\nis a complete unitary invariant.\nWe shall need the following elementary lemma.\nLemma 5.9. Let m,n, p, q be nonzero integers with m,n \u2265 1 such that\np 6= q and m 6= n. If \u03b3 : R\u2192 R induces a conformal automorphism of\nthe upper half plane and \u03b1, \u03b2 are real constants such that\nxp \u2212 xq = \u03b1\u03b3(x)m + \u03b2\u03b3(x)n + 2piN(x) almost everywhere,\nwhere N : R\u2192 Z then{{m,n}, {\u2212m,\u2212n}} = {{p, q}, {\u2212p,\u2212q}}.\nProof. Without loss of generality, suppose that p > q and m > n.\nEither \u03b3(x) = ax+ b where a > 0 and b \u2208 R, or \u03b3(x) = a\u2212 b(x\u2212 c)\u22121\nfor a, c \u2208 R and b > 0. Suppose first that \u03b3(x) = ax + b; without loss\nof generality, we may take a = 1. Since N is then continuous and so\nconstant on (0,\u221e) it follows that p, q \u2265 1 and so N is constant on R.\nThe equation\nxp \u2212 xq = \u03b1(x+ b)m + \u03b2(x+ b)n + 2piN\nholds almost everywhere. Considering the coefficient of xp gives \u03b1 = 1\nand m = p, so we suppose that n 6= q. Differentiating gives\npxp\u22121 \u2212 qxq\u22121 = p(x+ b)p\u22121 + \u03b2n(x+ b)n\u22121.\nIf q, n > 1 then we set x = \u2212b to deduce that b is algebraic, and set\nx equal to any other algebraic number to see that \u03b2 is also algebraic.\nSimple arguments show that the same holds if q > 1 and n = 1 or\nif q = 1 and n > 1. Now equate the constant terms in the original\nexpression:\n2piN = \u2212(bp + \u03b2bn).\nSince N \u2208 Z and the right hand side is algebraic, N = 0. By counting\nrepeated roots, it now follows that n = q.\nIf on the other hand \u03b3(x) = a\u2212 b(x\u2212 c)\u22121 then N is continuous and\nso constant on the components of R\\{0, c}, so p, q \u2264 \u22121 and N(x) = 0\nalmost everywhere for x > max{0, c} and for x < min{0, c}. Since the\nleft hand side is locally unbounded only at x = 0 and has limit 0 as\nx \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, we must have c = 0 and N(x) = 0 almost everywhere. It\nonly remains to consider the order of growth and decay at 0 and \u00b1\u221e\nto see that p = \u2212n and q = \u2212m. \u0003\nTheorem 5.10. Let p, q \u2208 Z\\{\u22121, 0, 1} with p 6= q and let m,n > 1 be\nintegers with m 6\u2261 n mod 2. The spheres \u03a3m,n and \u03a3p,q are unitarily\nequivalent if and only if{{m,n}, {\u2212m,\u2212n}} = {{p, q}, {\u2212p,\u2212q}}.\nMANIFOLDS OF HILBERT SPACE PROJECTIONS 29\nProof. First observe that the spheres are unitarily equivalent if these\nsets are equal, since the composition operator J1 corresponding to the\nmap x 7\u2192 \u2212x\u22121 satisfies (Ad J1)\u03a3m,n = \u03a3\u2212m,\u2212n.\nLet U \u2208 Unit(L2(R)) with (AdU)\u03a3m,n = \u03a3p,q. Consider the sub-\nspace UH2(R) \u2208 \u03a3p,q. Since AdU preserves the order structure, it\nmust map \u2202Mm,n onto \u2202Mp,q by Lemmas 5.6 and 5.8. By composi-\ntion with x 7\u2192 \u2212x if necessary, we may assume that UH2(R) \u2208 Mp,q\nand then translating by the \u201cobvious\u201d inner automorphisms of Mp,q,\nthat UH2(R) = H2(R).\nLet \u03c3 be the residue class of (m,n) in (Z\/2Z)2, which by assumption\nis in {(0, 1), (1, 0)}. Observe that by Lemma 5.6, the von Neumann\nalgebra generated by \u2202Mm,n = \u2202M\u03c3 is the multiplication algebra\nL\u221e(R), and the only possibilities for the algebra A = (\u2202Mp,q)\u2032\u2032 are\nA = L\u221e(R) or A = {Mf : f \u2208 L\u221e(R), f(x) = f(\u2212x)}.\nThe latter algebra has uniform multiplicity 2. Since AdU sends pro-\njections in (\u2202Mm,n)\u2032\u2032 to projections in (\u2202Mp,q)\u2032\u2032, it induces an isomor-\nphism between L\u221e(R) and A. Spatial isomorphisms preserve multi-\nplicity, so in fact A = L\u221e(R).\nNow AdU is an isomorphism L\u221e(R) \u2192 L\u221e(R) and it follows that\nU = M\u03d5C\u03b3 where \u03d5 \u2208 L\u221e(R) is unimodular and C\u03b3 is a unitary\ncomposition operator with symbol \u03b3, a Borel isomorphism. Exactly as\nin the proof of Theorem 5.5, \u03b3 induces a conformal automorphism of\nthe upper half plane. Since AdU is a homeomorphism with\nUH2(R) = H2(R) and U\u2202Mm,n = \u2202Mp,q,\nit maps the two componentsMm,n andM\u22a5m,n of \u03a3m,n \\\u2202Mm,n toMp,q\nand M\u22a5p,q respectively. In particular, there exist real \u03b1, \u03b2 such that\nei(x\np\u2212xq)H2(R) = Uei(\u03b1xm+\u03b2xn)H2(R)\n= ei(\u03b1\u03b3(x)\nm+\u03b2\u03b3(x)n)UH2(R)\n= ei(\u03b1\u03b3(x)\nm+\u03b2\u03b3(x)n)H2(R).\nHence the hypotheses of Lemma 5.9 are satisfied and the result follows.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] M.
