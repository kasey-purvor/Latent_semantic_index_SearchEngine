Hollox, PhD \n \nDepartment of Genetics, University of Leicester, UK \n \nCorrespondence to: \nDr E.J.Hollox \nDepartment of Genetics \nAdrian Building \nUniversity of Leicester \nUniversity Road \nLeicester LE1 7RH \nUK \n2 \n \n \nCrohn's disease (CD) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory disease, which most commonly \naffects the terminal ileum and colon, but can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. In the \nWest, the disease is frequent, with a prevalence of around 150 per 100,000 (ref 1), and \npatients have an increased risk of other inflammatory\/autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis, \nankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. It is a disease where both environmental and \ngenetic variation make an approximately equal contribution to disease risk; and the current \nconsensus suggests the disease is a result of an inappropriate immune response against gut \nmicrobes in a genetically susceptible host. The role in CD of a family of antimicrobial \nproteins and inflammatory mediators called beta-defensins is of considerable interest, yet \nthere is much controversy on how levels of these proteins, and variation of the genes that \nencode them, affects susceptibility to CD. In this issue, Bentley et al. (2) present data on the \ngenomic copy number of beta-defensin genes that not only fails to support previous work (3), \nbut completely contradicts it. What is going on? \n \nIn recent years, there has been considerable success in dissecting the individual \nenvironmental and genetic components to CD. Smoking has been shown to markedly affect \nthe clinical course of CD (4), and has been the most significant environmental component yet \nidentified.  Genomewide scans have been particularly successful  in identifying genetic loci \ninvolved, initially by using family data and linkage analysis, followed more recently by using \nlarge case-control cohorts and association analyses. These have both confirmed susceptibility \nloci and identified new loci, with NOD2\/CARD15 confirmed as the locus of strongest effect, \nwith an odds ratio of 4 (refs 5, 6). This locus alone contributes over 1% of the variance in \ntotal disease risk, but all 32 loci identified to date explain only 10% of the total disease risk \nvariance, suggesting that the variation at these loci each contribute very subtly to the etiology \n3 \n \nof the disease.  This leaves four\/fifths of the genetic variation in risk unexplained, and there \nhave been several suggestions on where this variation is hidden, including rare sequence \npolymorphisms and complex copy number polymorphism (where the number of copies of a \ngene vary between people). Case-control sample sizes of tens of thousands combined with \nnew technologies are needed to determine whether the hidden genetic risk really is in these \nclasses of polymorphism. \n \nWith this background, any clues from models of the etiology of the CD on where to look for \ngenetic variation in risk are very welcome. If, as commonly accepted, CD is the result of a \nloss of tolerance to gut flora and a subsequent inappropriate immune response leading to \ntissue damage, then factors involved in mediating tolerance to gut flora may have critical \nroles in controlling the progression to CD.  One of these factors may be the beta-defensins, \nwhich are a family of proteins sharing a conserved six-cysteine motif that forms three \ndisulphide bridges generating a characteristic tertiary protein structure. They have multiple \nfunctions, including direct antimicrobial activity and cytokine activity in inflammatory \nsignalling pathways. Four human beta-defensins are expressed in the gut: human beta-\ndefensin 1 (HBD-1) is expressed constitutively and human beta-defensins 2, 3 and 4 (HBD-2, \n-3, -4) are induced by bacterial and inflammatory stimuli, with HBD-2 induction mediated by \nthe NOD2\/CARD15 protein (7,8).  In CD, there is no induction of HBD-2 despite a severe \ninflammatory response. This is in contrast to the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative \ncolitis, where high levels of HBD-2 are characteristic of the inflammation sites; and also of \nthe inflammatory skin disease psoriasis, where expression of HBD-2 is a characteristic event \nand expression level associated with clinical severity (9). Perhaps this low level of beta-\ndefensin induction is the key characteristic of CD, and restoring beta-defensin levels would \nameliorate the disease? \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis of the beta-defensin genes revealed that they show copy number polymorphism \n(CNP); that is, different individuals have different numbers of the same gene in their \ngenomes. The genes encoding the four beta-defensins expressed in the gut (genes DEFB1, \nDEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104 encoding proteins HBD-1, -2, -3 and -4 respectively) are \nclustered at chromosomal region 8p23.1, and DEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104  (but not \nDEFB1) show copy number polymorphism and vary together as a group. For most genes we \nwould expect two copies per diploid genome, but for this cluster different people commonly \nhave between two and seven copies, with four copies being the most frequent (39% in \nEngland). The high and low extreme copy numbers are also at appreciable frequencies in the \npopulation (4% for two copies, 1.5% for 7 copies, in England) (10, 11). This prompts the \nquestion of whether the low gene copy number of beta-defensins is linked to the absence of \nbeta-defensin induction in CD, particularly DEFB4 (HBD-2), and therefore whether low gene \ncopy number of DEFB4 itself predisposes an individual to CD. \n \nFellerman et al (3) tackled this question by analysing two CD case-control cohorts from \nGermany and the United States. They found that CD patients had slightly lower mean DEFB4 \ncopy number than unaffected controls from the same population, suggesting that low DEFB4 \ncopy number was a susceptibility factor for CD. In addition, there was a correlation between \nDEFB4 copy number and expression levels of DEFB4 mRNA in mucosal biopsies from \npatients, supporting a direct causative link between low gene copy number, low expression \nand development of CD. The genetic association of low copy number and disease was \nsignificant only in those with colonic CD rather than ileal CD, and the authors suggested that \nthis reflects a difference in the levels of HBD-2 between ileum and colon. However, in this \nissue of the AJG, Bentley and colleagues present data showing a completely opposite effect \n5 \n \nof DEFB4 gene copy number, suggesting that high copy number is associated with both ileal \nand colonic CD (4). Another report published recently adds more data into this maelstrom of \nmixed messages: by measuring HBD-2 protein levels in colonic biopsies in ex vivo culture, \nthey find no association of DEFB4 copy number with expression level in patients or controls \n(12).  \n \nWhat are we to make of these contradicting results? Findings from early genetic association \nstudies on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were often not reproduced in subsequent \nstudies. An example is in Alzheimer's disease, where an association study examining the \nthreonine-alanine polymorphism at amino acid position 13 of the SERPINA3 gene (encoding \nalpha-1-antichymotrypsin) produced an increased risk associated with the threonine allele \n(13). A subsequent study, also using samples from the Japanese population, showed a \nsignificantly decreased risk due to that same threonine allele (14). A meta-analysis, where \nthese two studies and many others were analysed together, produced strong evidence that this \nSNP had no effect at all on susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (15). In this and other cases, \nthese conflicting results are usually due to small sample size limiting the power to detect \nsmall effects and enhancing the possibility of detecting false-positive results.  When one \ngenetic locus is analysed, samples sizes of thousands needed for genomewide association \nstudies (GWAS) are not necessarily required. This is because GWAS tests many thousands of \nloci for association with the disease of interest, and because of the power lost due to multiple \ntesting, very large sample sizes are required to detect weaker effects. Nevertheless, sample \nsizes of several hundred, at least, are needed to minimise false-positive rates, and independent \nreplication in another cohort of the same, or larger, sample size allows a high degree of \nconfidence in the result. Bentley has a respectable sample size (466 patients and 329 controls) \nbut no replication (2), and Fellermann has replication, but small sample sizes (85 patients, 20 \n6 \n \ncontrols and 149 patients, 169 controls, ref 3). With this cohort size, any observations are at \nbest only suggestive, at worst merely anecdotal. \n \nAccurately typing gene copy number is difficult using current technologies, certainly much \nmore difficult than the robust and reproducible single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  \ntyping that is now commonplace. This is for two reasons, firstly the ubiquity and importance \nof SNPs has been realised for some time, allowing sufficient time for new technologies to be \ndeveloped. Secondly, the inherent physical nature of SNPs allows more discrimination: there \nis a qualitative chemical difference between a cytosine and an adenine at a particular \nnucleotide position, whilst for CNPs there is only a qualitative difference - less or more of the \nsame DNA sequence. Quantitative real-time PCR assays, such as the assay used by both \nBentley and Fellermann, have been used extensively to robustly detect differences in mRNA \nexpression levels, levels that typically differ by several orders of magnitude. Yet for gene \ncopy number analysis using genomic DNA, these assays are required to distinguish four from \nfive copies, a relative increase of 0.25, which is a considerable challenge. Bentley and \ncolleagues produce lots of data using this approach, and tackle the issue of experimental error \nrate, but even in their hands repeating the assay five times still produces a 5% error rate (2).  \n \nThese two aspects of copy number association studies can confound a third source of error \nwhich may lead to false positive associations. In an association study, we interpret a \ndifference in allele frequency (for a SNP) or copy number distribution (for a CNP) between \ncases and controls as evidence of an influence of that particular polymorphism on disease. \nBut there may be other reasons for that difference:  population stratification or a difference in \nthe physico-chemical properties of the DNA between cases and controls. An example of the \nlatter was given in a case-control SNP association study where case and controls produced \n7 \n \nbiased genotype data, despite their being tested blind to disease status, and randomly \nassorting cases and controls among experiments (16).  \n \nThe contribution of Bentley et al. is valuable because it shows that the case for low DEFB4 \ngene copy number association with CD is doubtful. But we should be wary of concluding that \nthe opposite is true; as the authors state: \"A consensus view of the relationship of beta-\ndefensin genomic copy number with CD will only be obtained through further association \nand expression studies in large phenotypically well-defined cohorts.\" (2) The cohorts should \nbe as large as possible, and the methods used as reliable as possible in order to get the right \nanswer, and to prevent time and money being spent on research with shaky foundations. Until \nthe publication of the paper in this issue of AJG, the consensus was that the jury was out on \nthe case of association of low copy number DEFB4 with CD. Now, the jury is back in the \ncourtroom, and the verdict is \"not proven\". \n \n \nGuarantor of the article:  \nEdward J.
