Reconfiguration of communications\nsystems is a facilitator towards this convergence and enables the\ndynamic adaptation and optimization of the access\ncharacteristics. However, such far ranging optimization\nconcept involves many different mechanisms and work areas.\nEach of these areas provides an answer to a different\noptimization problem; Dynamic Network Planning and\nManagement (DNPM) provides a load and demand driven\noptimization of the radio planning of multiple different\nnetworks within a given area. Advanced Spectrum\nManagement (ASM) enables short term use of spectrum for\nservices with higher demand. Finally Joint Radio Resource\nManagement (JRRM) coordinates different access schemes and\nfacilitates a more centralized approach to allocation of radio\nresource. Each of the schemes optimizes spectrum and radio\nresource usage on a different time scale. ARRM deals with the\nrather short term allocation, ASM with more medium term\nspectrum assignments while DNPM assumes time scales up to\nthe range of weeks or months. Consequently, there is need of\ncombining all working areas in the form of a Functional\nArchitecture (FA), where each module represents a concept,\naiming at forming part of the global end-to-end\nreconfigurability architecture. This paper includes a detailed\nanalysis of the Reconfigurability FA, along with a description of\nthe functionality of each of the modules included therein.\nKeywords: End-to-end Reconfigurability, Functional\nArchitecture (FA).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe world of telecommunications is characterized by the\ncoexistence of a multitude of diverse Radio Access\nTechnology (RAT) standards. The most commonly used\ninclude traditional cellular networks, wireless shorter-range\nnetworks and broadcasting systems. Furthermore, the\nevolution of wireless communications can be summarized in\nthe migration of today's technologies towards the systems\nbeyond the third generation (B3G), aiming at the provision of\nhighly sophisticated services, transmitted at higher data rates,\nin a cost effective manner. B3G is expected to be based on IP\ntechnology yielding into a common, agile and seamless all -\nIP [1] architecture design, supporting scalability and\nmobility. In such context, the possibility of diverse RATs to\nbe optimally combined and coordinated under a global\ninfrastructure called \"B3G wireless access infrastructure\"\nstands as a basic prerequisite for the consolidation of B3G\nsystems [2].\nThis convergence is facilitated by the interworking of\npreviously competent - networks [3],[4],[5],[6], and (perhaps\nmost importantly) by the evolution of adaptive networks [7].\nNetworks' interworking imposes cooperation among\nNetwork Providers (NPs), so as to jointly handle extreme\ntraffic situations [8],[9], by splitting traffic among their\nRATs. For this purpose, the whole set of RATs should be\ndeployed in both network segments and terminals a priori.\nAdaptive networks, acting complementary to Software\nDefined Radio (SDR) [10], are able to dynamically adapt\ntheir behavior to various conditions (e.g., hot-spot situations,\ntraffic demand alterations, etc.) at different time zones and\nspatial regions, by exploiting deployments with much fewer\npre-installed components. In other words, adaptive networks\nallow their segments to dynamically select and configure the\nset of the most appropriate RATs, in order to better handle\nservice area regions or time variant requirements [1 1],[12].\nThe introduction of such intelligent systems has two\nprimary objectives: (1) Highly reliable communication\nwhenever and wherever needed, and (2) efficient utilization\nofthe radio spectrum. The activities in E2R project [7] aim at\ntranslating the vision of adaptive systems into reality. This\nwill be done by investigating and introducing concepts in\nAdvanced Spectrum Management (ASM), Joint Radio\nResource Management (JRRM), and Dynamic Network\nPlanning and Management (DNPM). Dynamic spectrum\naccess and on-the-fly availability of new RATs shall trigger\ncontrol and management interactions from source to\ndestination in order to adapt the system (e.g., network\nelements on the end-to-end path), the equipment (e.g.,\nfunction relocation), the application, the service or the\n0-7803-9392-9\/06\/$20.00 (c) 2006 IEEE\n196\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Hence, the end-to-end notion dictates the proposal of\ncoordinated management and control functions that govern\nthe interactions between the involved entities, and for\ngoverning the decision-making and enforcement of\nmechanisms supporting reconfiguration in a dynamic\nfashion.\nFurthermore, this paper constitutes a first step towards a\ncombination of the aforementioned working areas, in the\nform of a functional architecture, each module of which\nrepresents a working area that is an indispensable part of\nadaptive systems. For this purpose, the next section contains\na brief overview of the architecture, while the full version of\nthe paper will also analyze each of the modules in detail, in\nsection 3. Concluding remarks are drawn in section 4.\nII. FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\nThis section contains a high level description of the\nfunctional components that comprise the architecture of\nfuture, adaptive (reconfigurable) systems.\nThe provision of end-to-end reconfiguration services and\nreconfiguration management in Composite RAN\nenvironments, coupled with scenarios of evolved core\nnetwork architectures [13], should be accommodated within\ncontrol and management architectures. From a high-level\nperspective, the architecture consists of ReConfiguration\nManager (RCM), RAN Reconfiguration Support Function\n(R-RSF) and the Composite RAN Manager (CRM).The\nR-RSF and CRM manage a single or a Composite RAN,\nrespectively, thus being responsible for functions such as\naforementioned ASM, DNPM and JRRM.\nFigure 1: Functional Blocks Overview\nThe ASM will optimize the spectrum allocation\nadaptively. This includes the optimization of guard bands\nbetween the Radio Access Technologies (RATs). The JRRM\nshould handle the optimization of traffic through the\navailable RATs. One of the main concerns of JRRM is the\nvertical handover between RATs. The DNPM algorithms\ndeal with the dynamic radio cell behavior through power\nallocation and antenna techniques. The ASM, JRRM and\nDNPM will take the evolution of mobile communication\nsystems one step further towards cognitive radio.\nThe functionalities ofDNPM, ASM and JRRM are closely\ninterlocked and coupled (see Figure 1). Nevertheless the\ninterworking of these three concepts can be considered as\nthree interlocked loops. Each loop reacts based on the output\nparameters of the adjacent ones. The more inner a loop is\nlocated, the faster is their reaction time. Therefore the entities\nof the middle and inner-loop should be locally decentralized\nin order to combat delay through the route to a central entity.\nThe function of the outer-loop can be executed in a central\nentity at a central place, e.g. for GSM in the core network.\nIII. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BLOCKS\nThis section contains a more detailed description of all of\nthe functional architecture blocks outlined above.\nA. Meta Operator\nThe Meta Operator will allocate the spectrum to operators\nand will not mandatory possess spectrum, that is, it can only\ntrade with spectrum. This occurs in the outer loop.\nB. Inter Operator Economic Management (IOEM)\nIOEM aims at providing the economical functionalities for\ndynamic spectrum allocation. That is, the pricing and billing\nmechanism will be provided especially for spectrum pooling\nand sharing. The negotiation between operators will happen\nin long-term and therefore can be executed in a centralized\nmanner. Long-term means days or even hours, so that\nDNPM can trigger negotiation with other operators\nconcerning sport event or dynamic hot spots. This occurs in\nthe outer loop.\nC. Inter Operator Resource Management (IORM)\nAfter trading the spectrum by lEOMs and Meta operator,\nthe IORM aims at optimizing the spectrum usage efficiency\nsubject to the arrangement to the spectrum got. Based on the\ndatabase from the Meta operator or the current spectrum\nusage from the renting operators, the optimal location of the\nspectrum and the borrowed spectrum and the relevant guard\nband will be calculated. Furthermore, joint operation between\nimplementation parameters, e.g., antenna tilting angel will be\nexecuted. The functionalities will be react in long-term. This\noccurs in the outer loop.\nD. Dynamic Network Planning and Management\n(DNPM)\/Global Spectrum Allocation Manager (GSAM)\nDNPM is a framework dealing with planning and\nmanaging a reconfigurable network. It consists of a planning\nphase and a management phase.

In the management phase, radio network\nelements are subject to be reconfigured. Reconfiguration is\ntriggered by the management entities, e.g., the network\nelement manager, so that optimal adjustment of a radio\nnetwork targeting optimal parameter settings can be carried\nout. Typical scenarios of DNPM are the Remote Electric\nTilting (RET), Re-allocation of the Spectrum layers to the\nbase station, reconfigurable Multi Standard Base Station\n(MSBS).\nSince the dynamic release\/reallocate the spectrum named\nas GSAM (Global Spectrum Allocation Manager) in the base\nstation is one important function executed by the O&M\nsubsystem, which changes the operating spectrum of their\nRadio Access Technologies (RATs), we define this function\nin the same level of the DNPM. In most cases, this function\nworks faster than antenna tilting and network element\nreconfiguration in the scenario of MSBS1.\nThe interrelationship to other functional modules is\ndepicted in Figure 2, where the DNPM\/GSAM module\ninterworks with the traffic estimator, the ARRM modules in\nthe radio subsystem, the Local Spectrum Economic Manager,\nthe Local Spectrum Allocation Manager, the Network\nElement, e.g., Base Station, RNC, etc.\nJRRM\n~~K\nFixe cost\nSFM\nLong Term Traffic\nDemand Estimator\nLong term\nSpectrum\nusage\nFLS\nDNPM\nSpectrum Estimation and\nPlanning\nFlexible Management (Antenna\nTilting\/Power\/MSMS)\nGSAM\nSpectrum Allocation\nand Optimization\nImplementation\nParameter\nBase Station\nFigure 2: Inter-relationship ofDNPM\/GSAM with other\nfunctional blocks\nE. Local Spectrum Economic Management (LSEM)\nIn line with the space and time dependent spectrum\n1 In fact, the optimal solution for a hybrid network\nreconfiguration mechanism called Hybrid Radio Element\nManagement and Resource Management (HRERM) is still\nunder research. Therefore, the time scale comparison\nbetween those use cases is still left open.\nallocation in the higher logical layers (IOL, OL), the\nspectrum allocation and the price of spectrum usage will also\nbe space and time dependent, therefore the LSEMs will be\ndistributed and a LSEM will be responsible for one base\nstation. The task ofLSEM is to provide all the functionalities\nto give the users spectrum allocation credits after a certain\ntrading mechanism with respect to efficiently trade the\nspectrum and to optimize the economical gain of the\noperator.\nBased on Cognitive Radio, the user's terminal is no longer\na \"stupid\" entity, moreover it is able to learn about its\nenvironment and act according the experience.\nConsequently, the terminal is going to estimate its need for\nspectrum, calculates an evaluation of the spectrum and\nexpresses individually the need of spectrum by a bidding\nvector. This new ability inherently in Cognitive Radio allows\nother trading opportunities, e.g., negotiation and auctioning.\nTaking into account the channel as the bottleneck of a\nwireless communications system, the best choice of a trading\nmechanism allowing Cognitive Radios to apply its main\ncharacteristics is a sealed-bid auction.\nThe LSEM including the above mentioned Cognitive\nRadio concept reacts in the middle-loop and short-term.\nF. Local Spectrum Allocation Manager (LSAM)\nGiven the outputs of the auctioning between spectrum\nusers, the LSAM is in charge of finding the appropriate\nfrequency assignment of the spectrum between users to\nensure the co-channel interference intra and inter systems is\nwell managed. This auctioning can be seen as an extension of\nthe MAC of established systems while being also backward\ncompatible to the established system (i.e. it is also applicable\nin the context of e.g. classical 2G\/3G cellular systems where\nthe management and control of the radio resources is always\ncarried out from the network side).\nFigure 3: Internal LSAM functional block description\n198\nKPI Change from Radio System\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

ASMAgent\nThe ASM Agent aims at calculating the bids for GRECs\nsubject to budget constraint and to maximizing users'\nsatisfaction which is expressed in terms of QoS.\nThe functionalities are based on the cognitive radio\nconcepts and will complete the LSEM functionalities on the\noperator's side. (See argumentation for LSEM).\nThe bids will be calculated based on QoS- buffer size, QoS\n- buffer size change, number of critical data which should be\nurgently sent, budget constraint, individual Importance of\nService (IoS), reserved price and the history of auction the\nuser has already participated.\nH. Reconfiguration Agent\nThe reconfiguration agent is the agent controls the\nreconfiguration of the terminal. The inter-relationship with\nother functional module is shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4: Inter-relationship between the Reconfiguration\nAgent and other functional blocks\nJRRM and the single RAT's RRM are captured within the\nconcept of ARRM (Advanced Radio Resource\nManagement), this works in the inner-loop of the overall\nfunctional architecture.\nARRM provides higher spectrum efficiency while\nconquering the typical problems, such as the signal\nattenuation, terminal noise, fast fading due to multipath\nphenomenon, shadowing, Multiple Access Interference\n(MAI) and other typical system related features, e.g., the\nmutual relation between interference strength and duration\nperiod given by link adaptation.\nThese typical problems challenge us from using radio\nresources efficiently. The radio resource is not only, by\ndefinition, the radio spectrum, but also realized in the real\nradio network as, access rights for individual mobile users,\ntime period a mobile user being active, channelization codes,\ntransmission power, connection mode, etc., that require the\nmanagement functions being designed in different time\nscales. Furthermore, radio resources from different radio\nnetworks can be managed jointly in order to solve the\nencountered problems more effectively.\nBesides the functions introduced specified by the local\nradio resource management for a single RAT, the JRRM\ndefined as a set of networks' or cell layers' controlling\nmechanisms that supports intelligent admission of calls and\nsessions; distribution of traffic, power and the variances of\nthem, thereby aiming at an optimized usage ofradio resource\nand maximized system capacity. JRRM mechanisms work\nover multiple radio networks or cell layers with the necessary\nsupport of reconfigurable\/multi-mode terminals. JRRM is\noperated in a network which consists of several subnetworks\nor cell layers of a single radio network.\nFigure 5 outlines the interworking among GSAM, LSEM,\nLSAM and ARRM. The GSAM allocate spectrum resource\nto the groups of RATs and involving entities including the\nprimary operator and the secondary users. The LSEM\ninterfaces the SAM Agent dealing with the auctioning\nprocess. In each auction period, the LSAM allocate detailed\nspectrum brickworks to the selected RATs of the spectrum\nusers for better spectrum efficiency, since the LSAM is aware\nof the radio context compared to the LSEM. ARRM makes\nmost detailed spectrum allocation for the applied traffic. The\nfrequency ofARRM activation is higher than the LSAM, can\nbe around factor 10 or more. Upon the next auction, the\nLSAM will integrate the total spectrum used over time and\nreport back to LSEM by balancing the payment w.r.t. the\nreally used spectrum resource.\nFeedback on selected spectrum allocation\nhange\nCan bb integrated\n, Can be integrated for joint\nTime optimization\nFigure 5: Interworking among GSAM, LSEM, LSAM and\nARRM\nI. Performance improvements\nThe different modules and technologies forming part ofthe\nE2R functional architecture for spectrum and radio resource\nefficiency have been individually evaluated and their\npotential gains have been identified. For each of the\nmechanisms (ASM, JRRM and DNPM) different techniques\nand algorithms have been investigated. Exemplars of results\ninclude efficiency gains for ASM in the range of up to 52%\n(for Dynamic Spectrum Allocation) and up to 144% for\nenhanced Dynamic Channel Allocation. For JRRM, a\nreduction of dropping probability of up to 85% could be\nachieved. Finally, applying DNPM, efficiency gains in the\n199\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

These and further results\nare provided in detail in the E2R deliverable D5.4 [14].\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe migration of wireless communications beyond the\nthird generation (B3G) necessitates research in converging\nsystems, where many diverse functional capabilities\ncooperate over a global wireless access infrastructure. In this\ncontext, this paper has presented a functional architecture\ndepicting the cooperation among three main research areas in\nreconfigurable systems. i.e. the ASM, the DNPM and finally\nthe JRRM. It is expected that the definition of the\nfmnctionality of the aforementioned modules will help in\nelaborating more on their interrelation capabilities, so as to\nserve as a basis for the overall end-to-end reconfiguration\narchitecture.\nFuture related work includes more elaboration on the time\nscales of the functional modules as well as detailed study of\nthe values of the operational parameters that need to be\nconsidered in the inter-working of the different modules.\nMoreover, careful consideration of the potential to elaborate\non the usage of such functional architecture in B3G\ninfrastructures operating in adaptive mode is also envisaged,\nso as to fully exploit cognitive networking technologies.\n[8] P.Demestichas, N.Koutsouris, G.Koundourakis, K.Tsagkaris, A.Giko\nnomou, V.Stavroulaki, L.Papadopoulou, M.Theologou, G.Vivier, K.E\nl-Khazen, \"Management ofnetworks and services in a composite radio\ncontext\", IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine, Vol. 10, No. 4,\nAug. 2003, pp. 44-51.\n[9] P.
