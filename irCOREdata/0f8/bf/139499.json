Introduction\nSurface cracks account for the majority of structural fatigue failures. Cracks usually initiate\nfrom surface defects, which then develop into a part-through crack. Several observations\nhave shown that these cracks are usually semi-elliptical in shape and that in flat specimens\nthese cracks tend to retain a semi-elliptical shape during their growth [1,2].\nFor the analysis of fatigue crack growth, the Paris law [3] has proved to be a simple,\naccurate and robust approach where knowledge of stress intensity factor is enough to\npredict the growth rate of edge and through-thickness cracks. In order to analyse the\ngrowth of surface cracks under cyclic loading, it has been generally accepted to apply the\nParis law for the deepest and the surface points of the crack and then assume a semi-\nelliptical shape for the crack [2,4]. This has been expressed mathematically in terms of the\nsurface and the deepest points:\n\uf028 \uf029\nm\nDPDP KCdN\nda\n\uf044\uf03d ; \uf028 \uf029mSPSP KCdN\ndc\n\uf044\uf03d (1)\nDPC , SPC and m are material properties and should not depend on the loading and on the\ngeometry of the crack-component configuration.\nHowever, as early as the 1970s it was observed that the two material constants DPC and\nSPC are not equal. Corn [5] observed that small semi-circular surface cracks under either\ntensile or bending loads tend to retain their semi-circular shape. Yen and Pendleberry [6]\nsuggested that assuming DP\nm\nSP CC 9.0\uf03d can explain this behaviour since the SIF for the\ndeepest point of the small semi-circular crack is about 10% lower than the SIF at the\nsurface point.\nWu [7] argued that in a surface crack, if for each point on the crack front Paris law is\napplied as:\n4\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\nmKC\ndN\nda\n\uf066\uf066\n\uf066\n\uf044\uf03d\nThen by adopting Corn\u2019s observation [5], the following relation can be obtained for \uf028 \uf029\uf066C :\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\nm\nDPCC\n2sin11.01 \uf066\n\uf066\n\uf02d\uf0b4\uf02b\n\uf03d (2)\nIn equation 2, \uf066 denotes the parametric angle on the crack front and DPC corresponds to\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n2\n\uf070C .\nNotwithstanding the fact that equation (2) was derived for a crack where a = c, i.e. a semi-\ncircular crack, Wu used this formula to predict crack shape evolution trends for different\nsemi-elliptical surface cracks under bending and tension [7].\nIn order to take the above analysis one step further, the general problem of the growth of a\nsemi-elliptical surface crack under an arbitrary loading mode can be analysed. Instead of\nassuming that semi-circular cracks remain semi-circular, it is assumed that semi-elliptical\ncracks generally tend to retain their semi-elliptical shape. The results of this general\nanalysis confirm the fact that not only is \uf028 \uf029\uf066C not constant and varies depending on \uf066 , but\nalso that it is dependent on crack geometry and loading mode. The load-dependent nature\nof this coefficient makes its application questionable. Details of this analysis are given in\nAppendix A.\nQualitatively, the change in Paris law coefficient along the crack front can be related to\nchange in the stress state at the crack tip, from a state of high triaxiality of stress at the\ndeepest point, to a biaxial stress state at the surface points. Also, there is a larger plastic\n5region at the crack tip on the surface of the specimen, which further proves the requirement\nfor separate local treatment of the Paris law in the vicinity of the region.\nThe analysis given in Appendix A suggests that if the Paris law is applied to individual\npoints on the crack front in surface cracks, then the coefficients are not merely material\nproperties. It has been shown that \uf028 \uf029\uf066C generally depends on the geometric parameters of\nthe surface crack, and may also depend on loading. Therefore it has been mathematically\nshown that the multi-point analysis of surface cracks using Paris law is not a reliable\nmethod of fatigue life estimation. The errors caused from this approach vary depending on\nthe particular problem and in some cases can lead to non-conservative estimates.\n2. RMS stress intensity factors\nCruse and Besuner [8] were the first to utilise the concept of an integrated average of the\nstress intensity factor in what is now known as the Root Mean Square (RMS) Stress\nIntensity Factor (SIF). RMS SIF is defined, for the two principal growth dimensions, as:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf044\uf044\n\uf03d\nxAx\nx dAsKA\nK 22 1 and \uf028 \uf029\uf0f2\uf0f2\uf044\uf044\n\uf03d\nAy\ny\ny dAsKA\nK 22 1 (3)\nwhere\nxyx aaA \uf044\uf03d\uf044 \uf070 and yxy aaA \uf044\uf03d\uf044 \uf070\nTheir method involves definition of a number of characteristic dimensions (usually two) for\na crack; the crack propagation being described by keeping track of these dimensions. For\nthe crack shown in Fig. 1, these parameters are xa and ya which denote crack lengths in\nthe two perpendicular dimensions, as shown. Cruse and Besuner [8] assumed that the\ncoefficients of the Paris law for this type of analysis are the same as for when normal stress\nintensity factor values (i.e. K) are used.\n6Fig. 1: Two characteristic growth dimensions\nHence the Paris law for surface crack growth can be written as:\n\uf028 \uf029mARMSA KCdN\nda\n,\uf044\uf03d and \uf028 \uf029\nm\nBRMSB KCdN\ndc\n,\uf044\uf03d (4)\nwhere it is postulated that BA CC \uf03d . If this relation is valid, then the problem of surface\ncrack growth has been immensely simplified. By having two material properties (C and m,\nwhich are independent of geometry and loading), it is only sufficient to know the average\nstress intensity factor values for two directions to predict the crack growth in a specific\nmaterial.\nBefore detailing an experimental based examination of the abovementioned assumption, a\nfew points are worth mentioning:\n1) The surface point SIF value imposes a problem since at this point there is an immediate\ntransition in the state of stress from three dimensional to biaxial. This area usually\nencompasses a larger plastic zone as a result of this stress state, which means that this\nsingle point does not represent the overall crack behaviour near the surface. Another\n\u0394Ay \u0394 ya\nya\n2\nxa 2 xa \u0394 xa\nya\n\u0394Ax\n7suggested explanation is the different crack closure along the contour of the crack [9-10]. In\ntheir experiments, Kim and Song [10] observed that the crack opening ratio was about %10\ngreater at the deepest point than at the surface.\n2) It was shown that \uf028 \uf029\uf066C varies and is a function of crack geometry and loading. An\naveraged stress intensity factor, when used with the newly proposed form of the Paris law,\nwould essentially eliminate these variations.\n3) This new method intrinsically ensures that cracks retain their semi-elliptical shape, and\nno extra geometrical considerations are required.\n4) Assuming a two-point approach to the crack growth problem effectively results in\nignoring the value of stress intensity factor at other points along the crack front. Different\nloadings lead to different stress intensity factor variations, and two different loadings may\nresult in the same SIF values at the deepest and surface points for the two specimens\nrespectively. This, however, does not necessarily mean that the two cracks should evolve\nidentically.\nMahmoud [11,12] carried out extensive analyses of various surface crack growth data using\ndifferent techniques. The experiments\u2019 data consisted of 58 cracks from 20 tensile [11] and\n50 cracks from 15 references in bending plates [12], in order to identify the most accurate\nmethod. He concluded that whereas using the average value of SIF leads to more accurate\npredictions in tension, for specimens under bending it is the local SIF approach that yields\nmore accurate results.\nThe following section details experiments carried out to examine whether the Paris law\ncoefficient in the two directions are identical. These experiments also show that contrary to\nMahmoud\u2019s conclusion, using the averaged SIF approach leads to better predictions for\nspecimens under cyclic bending.\n83. Experimental study of surface crack growth under cyclic uniform loading\n3.1. Test procedure\nFor the study of the behaviour of surface cracks under fatigue conditions and to investigate\nthe applicability of the RMS SIF concept in modelling crack growth, two tests were carried\nout in which surface cracks were grown into plate steel specimens from a starter surface\nnotch. Both specimens were tested under uniform pure bending cyclic load. The only\ndifference between the two tests was the initial aspect ratio of the starter crack. In addition,\ntwo Compact Tension (CT) tests were carried out to obtain the Paris law coefficients of the\nmaterial. The specimen material in all cases was offshore steel BS7191 355D. Fig. 2\nshows the data obtained from the CT tests.\n1.0E-08\n1.0E-07\n1.0E-06\n1.0E-05\n10 100\nda\n\/d\nN\n(m\n\/c\nyc\nle\n)\nB-1 B-2\nDK (MPa m1\/2)\nTc\nFig. 2: CT Test Results\n9Fig. 3: Configuration of the Surface Crack Bending Tests\nFig. 3 shows the loading setup of the tests for growing surface cracks. The specimens were\nstrain gauged to verify the pure bending stress distribution. The stress intensity factors\nwere determined from Newman and Raju\u2019s formula [13], as a function of the crack\ngeometry:\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d \uf066\uf070 ,,,\nb\nc\nc\na\nt\naF\nQ\naHSK bI (5)\nHere F is a given function of the crack\/specimen geometry (a,c,t,b) for tensile and bending\nloading modes.\nFrom equation (3), after geometrical considerations, the RMS stress intensity factors can be\nevaluated as:\n165 2025\n400\n(units in mm)\nt = 25\nF\/2 F\/2\nF\/2 F\/2\n10\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0f2\uf03d\n\uf070\n\uf066\uf066\uf066\n\uf070 0\n222 sin\n2 dKK\nARMS\nand \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0f2\uf03d\n\uf070\n\uf066\uf066\uf066\n\uf070 0\n222 cos\n2 dKK\nBRMS\n(6)\nwhich is now in a form appropriate for substitution from equation (5).\nBeach marks were generated to record the crack shape evolution during each test. This was\nachieved by increasing the stress ratio R from 0.1 during primary crack growth to 0.6 for\nbeach mark generation. These beach marks are shown in Fig. 4.\nFig 4: Beach markings on the specimens\nThe specimens were prepared carefully taking account of the rolling direction before\nintroduction of the starter notches. Sinusoidal cyclic loading was applied by a servo-\nhydraulic fatigue test machine at a frequency of 2.0Hz. The test setup is shown in Fig 5.\n11\nFig 5: The test setup\n3.2. Results and analysis\nCrack growth curves in the form of crack depth (a) and crack half length (c) versus the\nnumber of cycles (N) were obtained as a basic output from the tests. A travelling\nmicroscope with an accuracy of \u00b10.001mm was used for the measurement of the depth and\nlength of the crack from the beach marks. The results of these analyses are shown in Fig. 6\nwhich shows the crack growth rates as a function of stress intensity values for the deepest\nand surface points. K values were calculated from the Newman and Raju [13] formula\n(equation (5)). It is clearly evident from the results of the two tests that the Paris law\ncoefficients are different for the surface and the deepest points; the surface point is shown\nto have a higher resistance to fatigue crack growth than the deepest point. This set of tests\nclearly illustrates and confirms the argument set out in the previous section that the Paris\nlaw coefficients are not constant as long as the point SIF values are used for crack growth\nmodelling.\n12\n1.0E-09\n1.0E-08\n1.0E-07\n1.0E-06\n10 100\nK (MPa*m^0.5)\nda\n\/d\nN\n,d\nc\/\ndN\n(m\n\/c\nyc\nle\n)\nTest 1-Deepest point\nTest 1-Surface point\nTest 2-Deepset point\nTest 2-Surface point\nFig 6: SIF versus crack growth rate for the deepest and surface points\nThe same data obtained from the tests can be analysed differently.

This reduces the anomaly created by\nthe biaxial stress and relatively large plastic zone in surface and near surface points. It is\nsuggested that this RMS SIF is more representative of the bulk crack behaviour, as growth\nbehaviour at discrete points along a crack front are dependent on the behaviour of the crack\nas a whole rather than acting in isolation. The RMS SIF approach appears to allow the\naccurate modelling of a surface crack using the modified Paris law. Contrary to the\nconventional Paris law, in this method the coefficients for the surface and depth directions\nare the same. This observation should be further validated by additional testing; however\nthe limited tests conducted here appear to support the theoretical explanation of the\nanomalous Paris law behaviour within two-dimensional surface cracks.\n4. Summary and Conclusions\nThis paper examined the theoretical basis for applying the Paris law to two-dimensional\nsurface cracks. It was shown that the Paris law coefficient could not be constant in the\nsame material if both the deepest and surface crack points are considered. An RMS SIF\napproach was considered for surface cracks focusing in particular on its use with the Paris\nlaw. The RMS SIF is a relatively simple but powerful method of representing two-\ndimensional crack growth in complex geometries and stress systems and promises to\nsimplify difficult situations such as crack growth through residual stress fields [14].\nThe theoretical basis that the same Paris law coefficient could be used for both length and\ndepth directions with RMS SIFs appears to be supported by the limited tests reported here.\nIt is recommended that further testing is carried out to verify this characteristic of the RMS\nSIF.\n14\nAppendix A\nA study of the growth of semi-elliptical cracks\nAssumptions:\n1) It is assumed that semi-elliptical cracks, under the action of cyclic tensile loading,\ngenerally remain semi-elliptical.\n2) It is assumed that incremental growth of the crack at points on the crack front is\nperpendicular to the crack front.\nFig A.1 shows a semi-elliptical crack 1C which, under the action of cyclic loading, has\ngrown into 2C . a\uf044 and c\uf044 denote the growth increments respectively in the depth and\nhalf-width of the crack. Point P is an arbitrary point on 1C with a parametric angle of \uf066 ,\ncorresponding to point P\uf0a2 on 2C .\nStarting from the general equation of an ellipse,\n1\n22\n\uf03d\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\nc\ny\na\nx pp and 1\n22\n\uf03d\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf044\uf02b\n\uf02b\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf044\uf02b\n\uf0a2\uf0a2\ncc\ny\naa\nx pp (A-1)\n\uf06c is the angle between the x-axis and PP \uf0a2 (the normal to the ellipse at P), and can be\nevaluated as a function of \uf066 as\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\n\uf066\uf06c cottan 1\na\nc (A-2)\nThe Paris law can be written as follows for point P:\n15\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\nmKC\ndN\nda\n\uf066\uf066\n\uf066\n\uf03d (A-3)\nFig. A.1.

Previous authors [5,13,7] have emphasised the dependence on\ngeometry but not the load-dependant nature of C. Whereas the dependence of C on \uf066 , a\nand c could be established with relative ease (which may imply the theoretical possibility of\na modified Paris law which takes these variations into account), the load dependence nature\nof this parameter suggests it is not possible to use the Paris law for the deepest and surface\n(or indeed any two) points along the crack face, since the errors resulting from this source\ncan not be usually (and certainly not easily) evaluated.\n19\nReferences\n[1] Cruse T A, Meyers G J, Wilson R B, Fatigue growth of surface cracks, Flaw\nGrowth and Fracture, ASTM STP 631 (January 1977).\n[2] Muller H M, Muller S, Munz D and Neumann J, Extension of surface cracks during\ncyclic loading, Fracture Mechanics: Seventeenth Volume; ASTM STP 905, pp. 625-\n643 (1986).\n[3] Paris P C and Erdogan F, A critical analysis of crack propagation laws, Journal of\nBasic Engineering, Vol. 85, pp. 528-534 (December 1963).\n[4] Mattheck C, Morawietz P and Munz D, Stress intensity factor at the surface and at\nthe deepest point of a semi-elliptical surface crack in plates under stress gradients,\nInternational Journal of Fracture, Vol.23, No. 3, pp. 201-212 (November 1983).\n[5] Corn D L, A study of cracking techniques for obtaining partial thickness cracks of\npre-selected depths and shapes, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 3, pp. 45-52\n(1971).\n[6] Yen C S and Pendleberry S L, Techniques for making shallow cracks in sheet\nmetals, Materials Research Standard, November 913 (1962).\n[7] Wu Shang-Xian, Shape change of surface crack during fatigue growth, Engineering\nFracture Mechanics, Vol. 22, No. 5, pp. 897-913 (1985).\n[8] Cruse T A and Besuner P M, Residual life prediction for surface cracks in complex\nstructural details, Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 12, No. 4 (April 1975).\n[9] Putra I S and Schijve J, Crack opening stress measurements of surface cracks in\n7075-T6 aluminium alloy plate specimen thorugh electron fractography, Fatigue\nand Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures, Vol. 15, pp. 323-338 (1992).\n[10] Kim J H and Song J H, Crack growth and closure behaviour of surface cracks under\naxial loading, Fatigue and Fracture of Engineering Materials and Structures, Vol.\n15, pp. 477-489.\n[11] Mahmoud M A, Quantitative prediction of growth patterns of surface fatigue cracks\nin tension plates, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 31, No. 6, pp. 735-746\n(1986).\n20\n[12] Mahmoud M A, Growth patterns of surface fatigue cracks under cyclic bending- a\nquantitative analysis, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 31, No. 2, pp. 357-369\n(1986).\n[13] Newman J C and Raju I S, An empirical stress-intensity factor equation for the\nsurface crack, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 15, No. 1-2, pp. 185-192\n(1981).\n[14] Brennan F P, Ngiam S S and Lee C W, Fatigue Crack Shape Control under Bending\nby Cold Working, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Vol. 75, No. 3-4, pp 355-363\n(2007).\n"}
