None of our patients showed any \nevidence of improved implicit or explicit visual ability in the blind field as a consequence \nof moving the arm. We suggest that WMs improvement was the consequence of a spatial \nbias towards the space containing his extended arm rather than the recruitment of \nbimodal neurons, and conclude that manipulating arm position is of little therapeutic \nvalue to patients with dense hemianopia \n \nKeywords: Hemianopia, Rehabilitation, Attention, Bimodal Neurons, Stroke, Posture \nIntroduction \nVisual loss in part of the visual field is a common consequence of  stroke \n(Kerkhoff, 1999). This visual loss is most frequently observed in one half of the visual \nfield of both of their eyes, and is known as homonymous hemianopia. Hemianopia is \nassociated with significant chronic disability, and although  attempts to restore vision to \nthe blind fields have been reported since 1979 (Zihl & von Cramon, 1979), they have \noften produced disappointing results (Lane, Smith, & Schenk, 2008). More recent \nattempts to restore vision have used a computerized training which utilises repeated \npresentation of stimuli along the border between the blind and seeing field (visual \nrestoration training; VRT). Early studies using VRT appeared promising, and it was \nclaimed that the training produced an average reduction in the extent of the blind field of \n5% (Kasten, Wust, Behrens-Baumann, & Sabel, 1998).  \nHowever, it is important to note in this context that the visual field of a human \nobserver is defined as the space within which visual stimuli can be detected while fixation \nis maintained at a central location. Strict fixation control is therefore essential to ensure \nreliable visual field measurements. Unfortunately, the early studies that demonstrated \nVRT driven reductions in the extent of the blind field failed to adequately monitor \nfixation, so the claims of significant reductions in the blind field were based on unreliable \nvisual field measurements. Studies which used strict means to monitor fixations found no \nsignificant benefits of VRT (Reinhard et al., 2005).  \nRecently, (Schendel & Robertson, 2004) suggested another possible way of \nreducing the visual loss experienced in patients with hemianopia. They reported the case \nof a patient with left-sided hemianopia whose ability to detect stimuli in his blind field \nimproved significantly when he had his arm extended into the blind field. The authors \nexplained this finding by pointing to the existence of bimodal, visuo-tactile neurons in \ndorsal regions of the visual cortex of monkeys (M. S. A. Graziano, C. G. Gross, C. S. R. \nTaylor, & T. Moore, 2004). They suggest that similar neurons may also exist in humans \nand that the manipulation of the arm position stimulates those bimodal neurons. This \nstimulation provides a sufficient boost to the visual signal from the blind field to bring it \nabove the threshold for conscious detection. Schendel and Robertson (2004) conclude \nthat their findings provide evidence for the existence of such bimodal neurons in the \nhuman cortex and importantly might provide a new avenue for restoring vision to the \nblind field of hemianopic patients.  \nThere are, however, a number of features of this study which suggest that caution \nshould be exercised in interpreting these results. Firstly, these findings were obtained in \nonly one patient. Importantly this patient was not a very typical hemianopic patient. His \nbaseline performance clearly shows spared visual ability in various locations of his so-\ncalled blind field. The study also suffered from a number of methodological flaws. \nFixation during the visual field mapping was not properly monitored. Instead a central \ntask was used to force subjects to keep fixation on a central location. This task is \nproblematic for two reasons. Firstly, it introduces an additional attentional load to the \ndetection task which could impair performance (Cartwright-Finch & Lavie, 2007). \nSecondly, the central task can only act as a fixation control if it employs very small visual \nfeatures that can only be recognized in foveal vision. No details regarding the size of the \nstimuli in the central task were provided, therefore it is unclear whether the central task \neffectively prevented eye-movements into the blind field. As we have seen above the \nproblem of insufficient monitoring of fixation has already led to the dismissal of earlier \nclaims of partial restoration of visual loss in patients with hemianopia, and therefore it is \na real worry that the same problem plagues the findings by Schendel & Robertson.  \nHowever, insufficient fixation control is not the only problem. It is clear from  \nprevious studies which have investigated preserved visual abilities in hemianopia that it is \nnecessary to take into account the possibility that patients may just guess or that they \nmight use different decision criteria for different task conditions (Campion, Latto, & \nSmith, 1983). Schendel & Robertson (2004) tried to correct for guessing by measuring \nthe false-alarm rate in catch trials (i.e., trials where no visual target was presented). They \nthen used a simple formula to correct the obtained hit-rate on the basis of the measured \nfalse alarm rate. Their formula calculated the guess-corrected hit-rate by multiplying their \noriginal hit-rate with the correct-rejection rate (i.e., 1- false alarm rate) obtained in the \ncatch trials. This approach has two problems: it does not control for criterion-shifts \nbetween task conditions (Campion et al., 1983) and it does not fully discount the effects \nof guessing. To illustrate this problem, let\u2019s assume that there are two conditions A and \nB. Let\u2019s further assume that the patient sees nothing in both conditions. However in \ncondition A he expects that there are stimuli in 50% of all trials (guess rate 50%) and in \ncondition B he expects stimuli in 20% of all trials. The uncorrected hit-rate will be 50% \nand 20% respectively, the corrected hit-rates according to the above formula (hit-rate x \n(1-false alarm)) will be 25% in condition A and 16% in condition B. If the correction \nprocess would work properly the corrected hit-rate should be identical, in fact should be \n0% since no genuine detection took place in both conditions. Instead with the correction \nprocess used in the Schendel & Robertson paper there remains a substantial difference in \nthe corrected hit rate of the two tasks despite the fact that genuine detection was absent in \nboth conditions.  \nThe aim of our study was to test the effect of arm position on the detection of \nvisual stimuli in the blind field of hemianopic patients while avoiding the problems \nidentified in the Schendel and Robertson study. Firstly, we tested not just a single case \nbut a group of 5 patients. Importantly all 5 patients had a dense hemianopia with no \nevidence of spared vision in their blind field. The visual fields of all patients were \nmapped using a manual Tuebinger Perimeter which allowed us to monitor the patients\u2019 \nfixation during the perimetric assessment. Moreover, we avoided the problems of \ninsufficient fixation control during the experiments by using video-based eye-tracking. \nThe best way to control for guessing and to avoid the confounding influence of criterion \nshifts is to use a criterion free method of assessing the detection rate (Gescheider, 1997). \nThis can be done by using a two-alternative forced choice method (2AFC). In 2AFC \nobservers always have to make a decision regardless of their conscious experience. This \navoids problems of criterion-shifts and guessing but it cannot discriminate between \nimplicit (unconscious) versus explicit (conscious) detection. To find out whether the arm-\nposition may have (as claimed by Schendel & Robertson) an effect on conscious \nexperience, we also employed a conventional detection paradigm where patients are \nsimply asked to indicate whether they saw the visual probe or not.  \n \nMethods \n \nParticipants \nFive patients with homonymous visual field deficits participated in the study. \nParticipants were selected from a group of patients who had previously completed an \nexperimental visual exploration training, and were chosen for their ability to maintain \nfixation during perimetry. Visual fields were established using Tuebinger Perimetry. \nTable 1 details the gender, age, lesion site and length of illness of each of the patients. \nFigure 1 illustrates lesion locations in the three patients for whom brain images were \navailable. None of the patients had co-morbid spatial deficits, as assessed by the star \ncancellation task (Halligan, Cockburn, & Wilson, 1991). Patients FP and VH presented \nwith mild hemiparesis of the contralesional arm when first diagnosed, however their \nclinical notes indicated that these conditions had resolved by the time of testing. All \nparticipants gave informed consent to participate according to the Declaration of Helsinki \n(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 1991). The study was approved by \nthe local NHS Research Ethics Committee and the Departmental Ethics Committee at \nDurham University.  \n \n***TABLE 1*** \n***FIGURE 1*** \n \nApparatus \n Stimuli were generated using a VSG 2\/5 graphics card (CRS, Rochester, England) \nand displayed on Sony Trinitron monitor with a 100 Hz refresh rate. Eye movements \nwere recorded using a Cambridge Research Systems Video Eyetracker Toolbox (2.1) \nsampling at 50 Hz. Participant responses were recorded by the experimenter using a \nstandard keyboard.  \n \nStimuli \nThe display consisted of a black screen with a fixation point at the centre (a 0.7\u00ba x \n0.7\u00ba white cross) and a horizontal white reference line running across the width of the \nscreen which was located 7.5\u00ba below the fixation point. The probe target consisted of a \n0.3\u00ba x 0.3\u00ba white spot. Probe targets could appear at one of 12 locations (4.5\u00ba, 9\u00ba or 13.5\u00ba \nto the left or right of fixation and 2.2\u00ba above or below the reference line, see Figure 2). \nThus, half the probes were presented to the blind field and half were presented to the \nsighted field \n \n***FIGURE 2*** \n \nProcedure \nTrials began with the presentation of a black screen with a white cross at the \ncentre and a horizontal white line running across the lower portion of the screen. After \n1500ms a probe appeared for 150ms then disappeared. After the offset of the probe the \nfixation point turned red, at which point the patient was instructed to report whether or \nnot they had seen the probe (Experiment 1) or indicate whether the probe was above or \nbelow the reference line (Experiment 2). The response was recorded by the investigator. \nThe fixation point then went white, signalling the start of a new trial. Targets were \nrandomly presented at one of the 12 potential locations.  \nParticipants were instructed to maintain fixation on the central cross throughout \ntrials, and not to search for the probe target. Compliance was measured using a video-\nbased eye-tracker. The order in which blocks were presented was counterbalanced across \nthe participants. For four of the five participants the screen was located 57cm away, such \nthat the screen could be brushed with the fingertips. For one participant (patient RE) this \ndistance was more than 20cm beyond the end of the outstretched arm, so the display was \nmoved forward by 20cm. For this patient the probes appeared at eccentricities of 6.9\u00b0, \n13.6\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 from the midline and had a diameter of 0.46\u00b0.  \nCL completed one block of 96 trials with his arm in his lap and one block of 96 \ntrials with his arm extended. LM completed one block of 120 trials with his arm in his lap \nand one block of 120 trials with his arm extended. RE, FP and VH completed 2 blocks of \n120 trials with the arm in the lap and 2 blocks of 120 trials with the arm extended.  For \nRE, FP and VH the arm-in-lap blocks and arm-extended blocks were interleaved and the \norder of the blocks was counterbalanced across the participants. \nIn the arm-extended condition the contralesional arm was stretched out such that \nthe fingertips were level with the monitor screen and the hand was just inside the edge of \nthe monitor. \n \nExperiment 1 used a standard detection paradigm. Subjects were instructed to \nreport whether they had seen the probe stimulus or not. This experiment explored \nsubjects\u2019 capacity for conscious vision in the blind field.  \n \nExperiment 2 used a two-alternative forced choice paradigm (2AFC). This \nparadigm tested subjects\u2019 implicit ability to respond to visual information in their blind \nfield. Performance in this paradigm will be independent of the decision criterion of the \nobserver and does not require visual awareness. The setup was identical to Experiment 1, \nwith the exception that participants were instructed to report whether the probe appeared \nabove or below the horizontal reference line. If they did not know they were required to \nguess. CL completed one block of 96 trials with his arm in his lap and one block of 96 \ntrials with his arm extended. LM, RE, FP and VH completed 2 blocks of 60 trials with the \narm in the lap and 2 blocks of 60 trials with the arm extended. For these participants arm-\nin-lap blocks and arm-extended blocks were interleaved and the order of the blocks was \ncounterbalanced across the participants.  \n \nResults \n \nExperiment 1 \n \nFixation Control \nFixation data was analysed off-line. Any trial which contained an eye-movement \nwith a magnitude of > 2\u00ba that occurred within 1650 ms of the trial onset (i.e. before the \nprobe stimulus had been presented) was excluded. Technical issues prevented the \ncollection of fixation data from patient RE, and he was not included in the fixation \nanalysis. This procedure resulted in the exclusion of 75 trials out of a total of 1632 trials \n(4.6%). Specifically we rejected 51 trials from CL (21 from the blind field, 30 from the \nsighted field), 16 trials from LM (6 blind, 10 sighted), 6 trials from FP (1 blind, 5 \nsighted) and 2 trials from VH (1 blind 1 sighted). Although we were not able to monitor \nRE\u2019s fixation during the task, previous visual field assessment with Tuebinger perimetry \nhad established that this patient was able to maintain good fixation when required.  \n \nDetection Accuracy \nScores were collapsed across the vertical position. The mean accuracy scores \nwere subjected to a 3 (Probe Eccentricity: 4.5\u00ba, 9\u00ba or 13.5\u00ba) x 2 (Probe Location; Seeing \nField vs. Blind Field) x 2 (Arm Position: arm-in-lap vs. arm-extended) repeated measures \nANOVA. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of probe location (F(1,4) = 1903, \nP<0.01) such that detection accuracy was better in the seeing field than the blind field. \nThere was no main effect of Arm Position (F(1,4) = 0.455, P = 0.537), and no interaction \nbetween Arm Position and Probe Location (F(1,4) = 0.333, P = 0.595) \nAlthough there was no group effect of Arm Position, it is possible that the arm \nmanipulation produced significant improvements within individuals which were masked \nby the group analysis. To assess this possibility we collapsed trials within each hemifield \nand compared detection in the arm-in-lap condition to accuracy in the arm-extended \ncondition for trials where the probe appeared in the blind field for each individual patient. \nFishers Exact Test was used when there were fewer than 40 observations in three or more \ncells, otherwise we used Chi-Square. There was no significant effect of moving the arm \ninto the blind field on detection accuracy for any of our participants (Table 2). \n \n***TABLE 2*** \n The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that patients\u2019 ability to detect visual \nstimuli appearing in the blind field was not significantly improved when the targets \nappeared in close proximity to the outstretched arm. This negative result was observed at \nboth a group level and individually within all five patients. This finding appears to be \ndirectly contrary to that by Schendel and Robertson (2004), who reported that \nmanipulating arm position significantly improved stimulus detection in the blind field, \nand related this result to activity of bimodal visual\/tactile neurons. However, although the \narm-position manipulation was not sufficient to elicit improvements in explicit target \ndetection, it is possible that presenting stimuli close to the extended arm was sufficient to \nmediate implicit, unconscious visual processing. Experiment 2 explores this possibility \nusing a two alternative forced choice localisation task.  \n \nExperiment 2 \n \nFixation Control \nFixation data were analysed as described for Experiment 1, resulting in the \nrejection of 163 out of 912 trials (17.9%). Specifically we rejected 79 trials from CL (44 \nfrom the blind field, 35 from the sighted field), 42 trials from LM (23 blind, 19 sighted), \n18 trials from FP (10 blind, 8 sighted) and 14 trials from VH (6 blind, 8 sighted). Again, \ntechnical issues prevented the collection of fixation data from patient RE so he was \nexcluded from the fixation analysis.  \n \nLocalisation Accuracy \nMean localisation accuracy scores were subjected to a 3 (Probe Eccentricity: 4.5\u00ba, \n9\u00ba or 13.5\u00ba) x 2 (Probe Location; Seeing field vs Blind Field) x 2 (Arm Position: Arm in \nlap vs Arm extended) repeated measures ANOVA. The analysis revealed a significant \nmain effect of probe location (F(1,4) = 155, P<0.01) such that localisation accuracy was \nbetter in the seeing field than in the blind field. Intriguingly, there was also a significant \nProbe Location by Probe Eccentricity interaction (F(2,8) = 5.49, P<0.05). Inspection of \nFigure 3 suggests that this interaction was driven by facilitated localisation rates for \ntargets in the blind field which appeared closest to fixation. There was no main effect of \nArm Position (F(1,4) = 1.025, P<0.369), and no interaction between Arm Position and \nProbe Location (F(1,4) = 1.026, P<0.368). \n \n***FIGURE 3*** \n \nAs with Experiment 1, it is possible that manipulation of arm position elicited \nindividual improvements in performance which were masked by the group analysis. To \ntest this possibility, localisation accuracy was compared in the arm extended and arm-in-\nlap conditions for each individual participant. Fishers Exact Test was used when there \nwere fewer than 40 observations in three or more cells, otherwise we used Chi-Square. \nNone of the patients exhibited significantly better localisation accuracy in the arm-\nextended condition (Table 3). Furthermore, one participant (VH) showed a non-\nsignificant trend toward improved localisation in the blind field in the arm-in-lap \ncondition (P=0.089) which was accompanied by a drop in performance in the sighted \nfield. \nIn summary, we observed no improvement in implicit target localisation in the \narm-extended condition. Critically, although localisation of targets in the blind field was \nmore accurate when targets appeared close to fixation, this was not mediated by the \nposition of the arm. As with the explicit detection task these negative findings were \nobtained both for the group data and for individual patients. These data are not consistent \nwith the suggestion that presenting visual stimuli close to the hand can mediate implicit \nvisual perception in the blind field of hemianopic patients.  \n \nDiscussion \n \nNot a single patient showed improved ability to detect visual stimuli in their blind \nfield when their arm was extended into the blind field. This was true both for the explicit \ndetection task (patients verbally report whether they had seen the target or not) and the \n2AFC task (patients had to indicate whether the stimuli was above or below a reference \nline). This result is clearly in contrast to the findings by Schendel & Robertson (2004). \nIt might be speculated that we did not find benefits of the arm-manipulation as the \nrelevant areas containing bimodal neurons have been damaged in our sample of patients. \nHowever, this explanation is highly unlikely. On the basis of the findings in monkeys it \nwould be expected that those areas are found in the human parietal and frontal lobes (M. \nS. A. Graziano, C. G. Gross, C.S.R. Taylor, & T. Moore, 2004) but in three cases (FP,CL \nand LM) the patients lesions appear to be restricted to the medial occipital lobe. \nHowever, it should be noted that there is neuroimaging for only one of these patients \n(FP). In the two other cases (CL & LM) we have relied on the clinical notes for lesion \nlocalisation.  \nIt is worth noting that some patients (LM and RE) in Experiment 2 improved \nslightly, but not significantly when the arm was in the blind field. It might thus be \nsuspected that our failure to obtain significant effects for the arm-manipulation might be \nrelated to a lack of statistical power. However, we would like to stress that on average the \nimprovement was only 3% and in Experiment 1 the improvement was less than 0.2%. \nBoth numbers are substantially lower than the improvements reported by Schendel & \nRobertson. Thus we would argue that it is not differences in statistical power but \ndifferences in methodology that explain the discrepancy between our results and those of \nSchendel & Robertson. Of course we cannot exclude the possibility that arm-\nmanipulation might lead to improved unconscious visual processing in the blind field of \nindividual patients. However, even if such improved unconscious visual processing were \nto be confirmed such a finding would be quite different from the claimed improvement of \nconscious vision and thus its relevance for neurorehabilition would be unclear. \nOn the basis of our findings we would suggest that extending the arm into the \nblind field does not attenuate visual loss in a patient\u2019s blind field. This prompts the \nquestion of how to explain the improved performance observed in the arm-extended \ncondition of the Schendel & Robertson study. In our view attention provides the best \nexplanation. We assume that extending the arm into the blind field will lead to a shift of \nattention into the blind field, and thereby enhance the processing of near-threshold \nsensory information in this hemifield. This would mean that the arm-manipulation does \nnot restore vision but enhances the ability to detect preserved, but degraded visual \ninformation in the blind field. This account is consistent with earlier findings and can also \nexplain the differences between our findings and those by Schendel & Robertson. It is \nclear that attending to a location will enhance the detectability of visual stimuli presented \nin or near the attended area (Smith & Schenk, in press (2008)). It is also well-established \nthat by positioning the arm into one half of the visual field (in particular if this is \ncombined with movements of the fingers) spatial attention is shifted into this part of the \nvisual field (Reed, Grubb, & Steele, 2006). In fact this technique is routinely used in the \ntreatment of patients with unilateral neglect (Robertson, McMillan, MacLeod, \nEdgeworth, & Brock, 2002). Taken together it is therefore not surprising that a patient \nwith partial visual field loss may also benefit from an extension of his arm into the \nimpaired visual field.  \nThis explanation assumes that vision is not completely destroyed in the patient\u2019s \nblind field but only degraded. There is in fact clear evidence from the visual field \nassessment of Schendel & Robertson\u2019s patient WM that he had islands of degraded but \npreserved vision in his so-called blind field. However, we think even those visual field \nmeasurements may have underestimated the true extent of the patient\u2019s spared vision. \nSince Schendel & Robertson used a central task to control fixation they effectively turned \nthe visual field assessment into a dual-task experiment. It is known both from the \nliterature on healthy subjects and patients with unilateral neglect that under such dual-\ntask conditions the detectability of peripheral stimuli can be substantially reduced \n(Cartwright-Finch & Lavie, 2007; N Lavie, 2005; N. Lavie & Robertson, 2001; Russell, \nMalhotra, & Husain, 2004; Santangelo & Belardinelli, 2007). This would suggest WM\u2019s \ntrue ability to detect stimuli in his \u201cblind\u201d field may be substantially greater than what \nhas been recorded in this dual-task form of perimetry. If we accept this analysis we could \nconclude that the arm-extension manipulation led to an attentional shift into the blind \nfield and counteracted the attentional pull towards the centre induced by the central task. \nThe improvement observed in the arm-extended condition would then simply reflect the \ntrue state of preserved vision in the affected field as compared to the suppressed state \ninduced by the central task in the standard condition.  \nThis account can also explain why we did not find any effects of arm-extension \non detection in the blind field of our patients. Our patients did not have any evidence of \npreserved vision in their blind field. This would explain why they could not benefit from \nthe attentional boost provided by the arm-manipulation.  \nSchendel & Robertson also observed a slight improvement in detection accuracy \nwhen the display was 180cm away and WM was asked to hold a tennis racket which \nextended his reach toward the monitor. They attribute this improvement to the expansion \nof the receptive fields of bimodal visuotactile neurons centred on the arm. However, we \nbelieve that this explanation is unlikely because WM simply held the racket and did not \nactively use it to make reaches. Previous studies investigating the expansion of receptive \nfields during tool use have found that passive holding of a tool is not sufficient to elicit \nthe expansion of receptive fields in either monkeys or humans (Maravita & Iriki, 2004). \nA more plausible explanation is that holding the tool produced a spatial bias towards the \nblind field, and it was this bias which produced improved detection accuracy.  \nAs we have already stated in the introduction there may have been other factors \nexplaining the improved detection performance in the Schendel & Robertson study. The \narm-extension condition may have raised WM\u2019s awareness for his blind hemifield and \nled him to expect more stimuli in this hemifield. Consequently he may have made more \neye-movements into this direction or just changed his decision criterion or guessing \nstrategy. These confounding factors cannot be excluded in the Schendel & Robertson \nstudy. These strategies were unavailable in our case (at least not in the case of \nExperiment 2) which could also explain why we did not find the effects described by \nSchendel & Robertson.  \nIn our view the findings of Schendel & Robertson are best explained in terms of \nattentional modulation. It is unclear whether bimodal neurons are needed to explain such \nlimb-movement induced shifts of attention, and therefore the existence of such attentional \neffects in humans is insufficient to prove the existence of bimodal neurons in the human \ncortex. More importantly, while such an attentional benefit may lead to improved \ndetectability of preserved but degraded vision, there is currently no evidence that it will \nattenuate complete visual loss in a patient with hemianopia. We would therefore conclude \non the basis of our findings that extending a patient\u2019s arm into their blind field does not \nattenuate visual loss, and is not a promising way for treating patients with homonymous \nvisual field deficits.  \nReferences \n \nCampion, J., Latto, R., & Smith, Y.
