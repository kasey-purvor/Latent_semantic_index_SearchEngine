In light of some problems regarding the implementation of the European Credit \nTransfer system (ECTS), the author proposes further reforms and offers some elements of a unified \ngrading system for European higher education. The author explores the variation among Europe\u2019s \ngrading systems and the resulting lessons learned are shared here. Lastly, this article also argues \nthat principles of justice and fairness, deemed central to academic freedom, are best upheld by the \nuse of a unified grading system at national and European levels. \nIntroduction \nThis paper provides a preliminary comparative analysis of the grading schemes in universities in the \n24 nations of the newly extended European Union (Cyprus was excluded as part of it is controlled \nby Turkey which is outside the EU).  The rationale for this work is three fold.   First, and most \nsignificantly, as a major lever for integration within the Bologna Process, all European Universities \nare being encouraged to use the norm referenced European Credit Transfer System.  More than one \nthousand higher education institutions in Europe now use ECTS [Reding, 2003], leading its \nadvocates to claim that \u201cThe tools it uses are tried and tested and have been shown to be effective.  \nThe principles on which it is based are sound\u201d [Adams, 2000, p. 19].  However Sullivan\u2019s case \nstudy on the use of ECTS to facilitate an exchange between a Swedish and UK university concluded \nthat \u201cneither is ECTS grade transfer the simple matter that university literature promoting \nSOCRATES purports, nor does the transferred grade reflect a similar level of achievement to that \nwhich the home university claims to assume\u201d [2002, p. 73] and complained about the misleading \n\u201cveneer of validity, reliable and standard maintenance\u201d of ECTS.  Cross-sectional work by Karran \n[2003], has also found ECTS to be flawed in calculation and ad hoc in operation, endorsing the \nrecent finding by Reichert and Tauch [2003] that \u201cECTS as a tool is undergoing rapid and far-\nreaching extensions before it has been properly understood in its original form in many institutions. \n\u2026 the system is still applied in a very rudimentary or haphazard fashion to student exchange and \ncredit transfer\u201d[p.67].  Similarly Haug has observed: \u201cforeign grades are not just numbers that can \nbe calculated by applying a mathematical formula, but a message that needs first to be understood \nin the original system and in a second stage interpreted by users in their own system.  Simple \np.1 \nmathematical formulas with their claim to universality are nothing but a fallacious \noversimplification of a reality they fail to capture\u201d [Haug, 1997, p.2].  Systems to transfer grades \nshould acknowledge and build on the rich diversity of EU higher education, unlike the current \nmechanistic system, which masks rather than explores this diversity.  Hence a further rationale for \nthis analysis, is to provide some quantitative flesh to inform and enrich the bare bones approach \noffered by systems such as ECTS, and increase knowledge and awareness of grading systems used \nin Europe.  This aspiration is particularly pertinent to the U.K. h.e. sector, given that Reichert and \nTauch found that \u201cacademic staff awareness of the Bologna Process seems to be particularly low in \nEstonia, Lithuania, Sweden, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK has by far the lowest \nBP awareness score for academics)\u201d [p. 19].  Moreover, the expansion of the European Union in \nMay 2004, has meant that universities in the 15 nations that previously constituted the Union now \nhave to familiarize themselves with the h.e. systems of the new ten nations, in order to facilitate \nstudent mobility within the enlarged European higher education area.  \nSecondly, as part of the quality assurance agenda within higher education in the U.K., there \nhave been studies of the vagaries of the U.K. grading system to determine (inter alia) why there are \ndifferent distributions of degree grades between different subjects and universities.  Yorke et al \n[2002], for example, found that 22% of U.K. first degree awards in Mathematics were at first class \nhonours level, while the comparable figure for first class honours in Law degree awards was only \n4.1%, and that this variation appeared to have little relationship (if any) to any other identifiable \nmeasure of input.  Further work by the same group demonstrated that \u201cthe honours degree \nclassification is considerably less robust that its supporters would prefer\u201d [Yorke et al 2004, p.411].  \nSimilarly, Woolf and Turner [1997] conducted an investigation based on student records from seven \ninstitutions and found that when students\u2019 results were re-classified using the systems of \nuniversities other than their own, 15% were allocated to a degree classes which differed from the \nactual award made in the students\u2019 home institutions.  Furthermore Parlour [1995], following an \nanalysis of results on a modular degree programme, concluded \u201cexcept in the most limited \ncircumstances, it is impossible to define rules that can ensure that the British honours degree \nclassification process conforms to the basic principles of comparative justice\u201d[p.37].  This work \nlead to calls for a grade-related criterion common grading scheme [Hornby, 2003] and even the \nabandoning of the honours scheme [Elton, 2004, Macfarlane, 1998], while a recent comprehensive \nU.K. study commissioned to examine national policy relating to measuring student achievement and \ndegree classifications concluded that \u201cthe existing honours degree classification system has outlived \nits usefulness and is no longer fit for purpose\u201d [Scoping Group, 2004, p.4].   Given these apparent \nproblems with the U.K. system, it may be useful to examine grading systems elsewhere to see \np.2 \nwhether changes in the U.K. system, bringing it nearer to those systems used in the EU, might lead \nto improvements. \nThirdly, this attempt at a preliminary comparative analysis of the EU h.e. grading schemes, \nhas been undertaken because, as Norcini and Shea [1997] point out, \u201cIf the results of the licensure \nand certification or credentialing process are to be useful, valued and taken seriously, a body of \nevidence relating to the credibility of the standards and to its comparability over time and forms \nmust be developed\u201d [p.39].  Additionally, on a more general level, as Teichler [1996] has noted \n\u201cAnalysis of any issue in higher education is enriched by broad knowledge from various countries. \n\u2026. And comparisons are indispensable for understanding a reality shaped by common international \ntrends, reforms frequently based on comparative observation, as well as growing trans-national \nactivities and partial supra-national integration in higher education\u201d [p.462f]. \nMethodology \nTo undertake the analysis, the following data was gathered from 24 EU nation states: \n\u2022 The national grading system; \n\u2022 The verbal description of those grades, in the native language; \n\u2022 The verbal description of those grades, translated into English; \n\u2022 A percentage equivalent for those grades; \n\u2022 The number of times re-sits are allowed for failed assessments; \n\u2022 Whether the reassessment marks is awarded without penalty. \nThis data was gathered from various sources.  First, via the following organisations: \n\u2022 The UK National Recognition Information Centre (http:\/\/www.naric.org.uk\/); \n\u2022 The European Network of Information Centres (http:\/\/www.enic-naric.net\/); \n\u2022 The World Education Services International Grade Conversion Guide For Higher Education \n(http:\/\/www.wes.org\/gradeconversionguide\/); \n\u2022 The International Association of Universities Higher Education Systems Database \n(http:\/\/www.unesco.org\/iau\/whed.html. \nThis information was augmented by data from the relevant government ministries (for example, the \nMinisterio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia in Spain) and accrediting organizations (for example the \nAkkreditierungsrat in Germany), gathered via their websites and through email contact.  Finally the \ndata was then checked against the details provided by websites of individual universities in the EU \nnation states.  Once the data was gathered, it was emailed to the ECTS co-ordinators in the \nindividual nation states, to verify its accuracy.  The summary tables are shown in the Appendix. \nGathering this information on the grading systems, their verbal descriptions in the native \nlanguage and English, and the percentage equivalents was problematic.  Often the grading system is \np.3 \nindicative, with variations between different subjects in the same university, and between different \nuniversities in the same state, although in countries where grades are determined by national law, \nthere is less discretion to deviate.  There are variations in the grade descriptions also, although often \nthese are not great \u2013 for example one university might describe a grade as \u201cVery Good\u201d, while \nanother might use the description \u201cEspecially Good.\u201d  However, direct translations of a grade \ndescriptor into English can fail to accommodate the national, cultural and academic nuances \nassociated with that grade, which may differ from the \u201cVery Good\u201d used elsewhere.  In addition, \nsome universities in some nations (Belgium, Finland, Portugal) use a Latin description of the grade \n(Summa Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, etc.) along with the national description, while others do \nnot.  Moreover, because of implementing the Bologna Process, and as a result of national policies, \nsome countries (e.g. Spain and the Slovak Republic) are in the process of changing their grading \nsystems.  However, the greatest difficulty arises in trying to calculate a percentage equivalent, \nwhich can act as a common denominator for the grades.  First, because universities in some states \nnever convert to percentages, this is most prevalent where the number of grades is small (e.g. \nSweden).  Secondly, because even where universities do provide percentage equivalents for their \ngrades, they differ in the percentage equivalents that they use.  Where variation in the grades, their \ndescriptions, and their percentage equivalents did occur, data was gathered from as many \nuniversities as possible (made easier by the fact that most, if not all, have institutional websites), \nand then compared to identify the most commonly used grading system, description and percentage \nequivalents.  Consequently the information on the individual nation states provided in the appendix \nis a best possible approximation gathered from most common usage, but from which individual \nuniversities may (and will) vary. \nHence, a preliminary, but crucially important point, concerns the extent of within nation \nvariation in the calculation of grades.  For example, in the U.K. it is universally accepted that, \nirrespective as to the subject or institution, a student with a final grade percentage over 70 % \n(however this is computed) will be awarded a first class honours degree.  By contrast, in France, the \nhighest grade \u201cExcellent\u201d can be awarded if a student\u2019s scores more than 16 or 18 out of 20, \ndepending on the University and\/or the Faculty. Similarly, in Sweden there is no grading system \ndetermined by law, so each university is free to use their own system within certain limits.  \nFaculties of Engineering have their own system within which students are awarded 3 (pass), 4 (pass \nwith honours lower grade) or 5 (pass with honours upper grade), where 5 is the highest grade.  \nFaculties of Arts and Sciences have their own system, which uses two grades - pass and pass with \nhonours.  This variation confirms the findings of a study of the degree classification systems in \nAustralia, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the USA and the UK \ncommissioned by the U.K. Higher Education Quality Assurance Agency which found \u201cDespite \np.4 \nextensive comparative work at European level into all manner of aspects of higher education as part \nof the Bologna process, assessment, like the content of courses, is very much left up to individual \ncountries\u2019 own schemes\u201d [Denholme, 2004, p.4] and that \u201cIt is striking from the comparisons with \nother countries how the UK education system in general places enormous emphasis on ensuring \nstandards are comparable, Compared to some of the other higher education systems considered in \nthis paper, UK higher education pays far more attention to issues of quality and standards\u201d [p.45]. \nAnalysis of the Variation in Grading Systems. \nData on the process of how grades were determined was not requested.  However, the same sources \nused to gather information on grading systems also offer detailed descriptions of the national \nsystems.  Although there are variations in the national grading systems, virtually without exception \nthey all operate criterion referenced systems, determining a student\u2019s grade by comparing his or her \nachievements with criteria for learning outcomes and standards for particular levels of performance.  \nThe goal being to grade student achievement against objective reference points that are independent \nof the size or composition of the cohort being assessed.  Practice varies in the extent to which these \ncriteria and standards are explicit and clearly stated.  Some universities (and national agencies) \nprovide explicit templates, indicating the level of knowledge expected from each student at each \npoint in the grading system.  There are minor exceptions to this general rule of criterion referencing \n\u2013 at present Spanish universities use a form of norm referencing for the award of their highest \ngrade, and the \u2018Matricula de Honor\u2019 may not, by law, be awarded to more than 5% of students.  The \npredominance of criterion referencing in the grading systems of Universities in EU nations, and the \nrecent growing emphasis put on the use of learning outcomes within the Bologna process by the \nBerlin Communiqu\u00e9, renders problematic the norm referenced rationale of the ECTS, if coherent \nintegration of European higher education is to be achieved.  \nWith the exception of Sweden, universities in all EU states use a numeric system of grading, \nallied to the use of grade descriptors.  However, in addition to variation in the use of grades within \nnation states, there is great variation between the grading systems of nation states.  For example, \nuniversities in Finland use two grading scales, which range from 5 or 3 (highest) to 1+ (lowest), \nDenmark\u2019s scale ranges from 13 (highest) to 6 (lowest), but there is no grade 12, while Italy\u2019s pass \ngrades range from 30+ to 18.  However, the majority of grade scales are ascending, that is the \nhigher the grade, the higher the mark, although there are some exceptions - Austria, Germany, the \nCzech Republic, Ireland, Malta and the U.K., although the latter three apply a grading system based \ndirectly on ascending percentage values.  The systems operating in Ireland, Malta and the U.K., are \nunusual in using aggregated percentage scores (rather than grades) to determine degree \nclassifications.  Generally, there is no predominant grading system within the EU, the most \np.5 \ncommon are the 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) scale, which is used in five nations, and the 1 to 20 scale, \nwhich is also used in five nations. \nIn respect of the number of pass grades which can be awarded within each system, again \nthere is no common pattern.  However, it is unusual for grade scales to be symmetric about the pass \ngrade \u2013 in all states bar one, there are more grades above the pass grade than below it.  Sweden has \nonly 2\/3 pass grades, as does the Czech Republic, while within the German grading system, there \nare up to 11 different pass grades which could be recorded.  Again there is no common \ndenominator, although nine nations use a system providing 4 grading categories, with seven nations \nusing a four point scale, seven nations using a five point scale and four nations using a six point \nscale.  However, most grading systems have, at the top of their range, a category reserved for the \nmost excellent, for example, in the Flemish part of Belgium students scoring the maximum value of \n20, get the award of Met de grootste onderscheiding met felicitaties van de Examencommissie (With \nfull praise\/with highest honours, with congratulations of the Board of Examiners).  However, there \nare variations in how this is highest grade is awarded.  In Spain, under the old grading system, by \nlaw the highest grade of Matricula de Honour (Matriculation with Honours) was only awarded to \nthe top five percent of students.  In Latvia, although the grading systems runs from 1 to 10, and \nGrade 8 \u013boti Labi (Very Good) is the normal maximum grade. Grades 9 Teicami (Excellent) and 10 \nIzcili (With Distinction) are reserved for especially advanced students who demonstrate knowledge \nthat is substantially higher than that expected for the course (e.g. the student has read research-level \nliterature or been involved in research in the relevant field).  Similarly, in Italy, the top mark of 30, \ncan be awarded con lode\/cum laude and, exceptionally, con lode e pubblicazione which implies \npublication of a thesis. \nAt the bottom end of the scale, most nations have a minimum \u201cSatisfactory\u201d or \u201cSufficient\u201d \ngrade (although Greece and Sweden do not).  Between the minimum pass and the very highest \ngrades, virtually all nations have grades representing \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cVery Good\u201d.  However, the \ndegree of differentiation within these grades, which are likely to be those awarded to the majority of \nstudents, varies considerably from one country to the next.  Some national systems (e.g., Germany, \nLatvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland) have more than one \u201cSatisfactory\u201d grade, and some nations \nalso split the \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cVery Good\u201d categories into finer gradations, while the Danish system \ngrades performance as being \u201cBelow Average\u201d, \u201cAverage\u201d and \u201cAbove Average\u201d, with higher \ngrades being awarded on the basis of both excellence and independence. \nThe problems of attempting to calculate percentage equivalents for the different grades was \nalluded to above.  However, although not definitive, such conversion into percentages provides data \nabout the size of the different grading categories.  As would be expected, in some instances, the \nhigher grade categories are smaller in size.  However, as usual, there are exceptions \u2013 such as the \np.6 \nCzech Republic and Estonia, where the grade limits (as measured in percentages) are similar \nthroughout the different grades on the scale, while in Hungary, the highest two grades \u201cExcellent\u201d \n(Jeles) and \u201cGood\u201d (J\u00f3) are larger than the \u201cFair\u201d (K\u00f6zepes) and \u201cSatisfactory\u201d (El\u00e9gs\u00e9ges) grades.  \nConverting to percentages also enables a comparison of the pass mark, although it many cases (e.g. \nFinland and Sweden), it is very difficult to estimate, Although variation exists, by far the most \ncommon pass mark borders on the equivalent of 50% (i.e. between 48-51%), and is used by more \nthan half the EU nations.  A pass mark equivalent to 55% or higher is used by six nations, and at the \nother end of the scale a pass mark in the 40-45% range is used by four nations including the U.K.  \nMost nations have only one fail grade, variously described as \u201cFail\u201d, \u201cNot Sufficient,\u201d \nUnsatisfactory\u201d, or \u201cPoor\u201d.  However, some systems allow for the possibility of the possibility of \nretrieval through deliberation, and others discriminate between various levels of failure. \nInformation on the number of re-sits allowed and whether the re-sit mark counted was \nrequested, but not always provided, so that a full set of responses is not available.  Nevertheless, the \ndata available pointed to a wide variety of practices.  For example, there is an Italian tradition that \nstudents can decide if they wish accept the mark they have obtained or if they want to re-sit \nexaminations even if they have not failed, and they can re-sit examinations at least once and often \nmore than once.  By contrast, in Denmark, if students fail, they have 3 attempts to pass. Missing \nattempts are mentioned on students\u2019 score sheets, but not counted in the total average, so many \nstudents, if they cannot get good marks in a test, choose to give back a blank sheet obtaining a zero \n(00), and opt to re-sit the examination.  If a student cannot pass with three attempts, the University \ncan give dispensations based on individual judgments and after four attempts the University has to \ngain permission from the Ministry to allow another re-sit, but this is granted more or less \nautomatically.  In Finland, Germany and Latvia (and, one suspects, elsewhere) there are no common \nnational rules about re-sitting examinations, and universities provide their own regulations, \nalthough normally students can re-sit examinations twice.  Despite these differences in regulations \nconcerning how many, and under what circumstances, re-sits were allowed, virtually all the \ndifferent systems allowed the full re-sit mark to stand.   \nThis preliminary analysis raises some interesting questions. More particularly, if one wished \nto achieve better integration of European higher education by constructing a new pan European \ngrading system based on usual and common practice across the EU, as revealed in the tables in the \nAppendix, what would its major features be?  Such a grading scale would be criterion referenced \nagainst the achievement of agreed learning outcomes, with five or more pass grades, of which one \nwould be reserved for the very best students, but which would allow different categories among the \naverage and good students (by far the largest groups) to be readily discerned.  The grading system \nwould be ascending and either based on a 1-10 or 1-20 scale, with each scale category equal in size.  \np.7 \nThe pass mark would be 5\/10 or 10\/20, above which there would be a satisfactory grade, and \nstudents would have the right to at least two re-sits without penalties for re-assessment. \nLessons for the UK and the EU \nThe study shows that, when compared with the rest of Europe, the U.K.\u2019s grading system is not \ntypical \u2013 very few other nations utilize percentage scores that are then aggregated into grades.  The \nuse of percentages in determining grades gives the process a veneer of statistical respectability \nwhich differs from the practice, as McLachlan et al [2000] note \u201cthere is a widespread illusion that \nessays are traditionally marked on an interval scale, expressed in percentages, on which arithmetical \noperations can be carried out.  However, essays are marked on an ordinal scale, in which the rank \ncategories are determined by a kind of gestalt perception, sometimes reinforced by criterion \nguidelines\u201d [p.790].  Moreover, as Dalziel [1998] opines \u201cvery basic problems arise from any \nattempt to use numerical data to represent performance.  These problems are most obvious when \napplied to the practices of adding scores together (in some form) to produce final marks\u201d [p.353].  \nHence any problems that occur with using percentages as raw scores are further compounded by \nvariations in the mode of aggregation, both between and within U.K. universities, and the absence \nof \u201ca clear rationale for the grading scale(s) and algorithm(s) that have been chosen\u201d [Yorke, 2001, \np.16].  For example Simonite [2000] found that \u201cclassification systems based on selected results \nfavour students whose performance is variable \u2026 students who perform consistently will expect to \nreceive poorer degree classifications than other students who have the same mean level of \nachievement but who perform less consistently\u201d [p.207].  Examining the use of percentage scales, \nHornby [2003] concluded that their use \u201cfor assessing students\u2019 work is seriously flawed. \u2026 the use \nof percentage scales leads to inequities that are hard to justify\u201d [p.451].  Moving to European style \ngrades should lessen such inequities for, as Bridges et al [1999] found, there is \u201cevidence of \ndiscipline-related marking behaviour when percentages are used \u2026 (but that) \u2026 differences \nbetween subjects are less marked when grading systems are used\u201d [p.298]. \nIn addition, the U.K. system has a limited number of degree classifications when compared \nwith most other EU nations.  The Dearing Report contended that \u201cwhile the classification made \nsense in a small homogenous system where the general classification said something meaningful \nabout a student\u2019s achievements, it no longer provided useful information\u201d [NICHE, 1997, p.140].  \nEndorsing this view, Winter [1993] has asserted that \u201cthe classified honours degree and the grading \nprocess which underpins it is an interesting historical growth whose roots stretch deep into the past \nand whose branches ramify widely into our current culture, but on educational grounds it is \nindefensible\u201d [p.375].  The use of broader range of grade scales would address some of these \ncriticisms, given that, as work by Yorke et al [2000] found \u201cthe use of grading scales (of 16 or 20 \np.8 \npoints, for example) seems to spread out the performances in subjects characterized by narrow \npercentage ranges\u201d [p.13].  This was underlined by work by Bridges et al [2002] which discovered \nthat \u201cthe use of a grade scale tends to encourage a greater spread of marks, provided that the grade \nscale is not calibrated to a percentage scale\u201d [p.42].  Hence adopting a wider grading scale, similar \nto those used in other European states, would address some of the known problems of the U.K. \ndegree classification system, as well as encourage further integration within the European higher \neducation area. \nTwo further areas of difference where the U.K. might usefully adopt European practice \nconcern the pass mark, and the ability to retrieve failure.  Defining where the pass\/fail cutoff should \noccur is clearly problematic, irrespective as to the method of grading.  However, given the extended \nuse of explicit learning outcomes within UK degree programs, it may be difficult to justify \nawarding a pass where the candidate achieves less than half the learning outcomes, more \nparticularly where graduation is allied to professional competence, as for example, in law or \nmedicine.  It is worth noting that the theory paper of the UK driving test requires that candidates get \n30 out of 35 questions correct (86%) to pass, while students in higher education are required only to \nsecure grades of 40% to demonstrate they have sufficient knowledge of a particular subject to be \nawarded an honours degree (albeit third class).  Increasing the pass mark to 50% or its grade \nequivalent would not disadvantage students, provided changes were made to reassessment \nregulations.  Currently, in most UK universities one re-sit is allowed and the maximum mark that \nmay be awarded for a unit upon reassessment is 40%, a practice described by one ECTS National \nCounselor as \u201codd, because it looks as if the student is cursed for life for not achieving the learning \noutcomes once, for whatever reason.\u201d  Given that the main purpose of assessment is to enable \nstudents to demonstrate their mastery of specific knowledge and skills, whether they achieve this at \nthe first or second attempt in no way diminishes their abilities, for which they should therefore be \naccorded the same grades as other students demonstrating the same level of competence.  Applying \na penalty to success via a second attempt, as the current UK system does, constitutes a disincentive \nto striving for excellence among students who fail at the first attempt. \nThe analysis shows that the level of convergence between the differing examination systems \namong the nation states is greater than might be expected, given the number of states and their \ndiverse histories, suggesting that creating and implementing a European wide system of grading \ncould be technically possible.  Morrison et al [1997] argue that \u201cA Europe wide uniform mark scale \nwould ensure that all universities could quickly appraise the academic profile of a visiting student \nby glancing at his or her achievements to date, calibrated in uniform marks\u201d [p.412].  A Europe-\nwide uniform criterion referenced grade scale would differ from the current norm-referenced ECTS, \nwhich defines the rate of exchange between pairs of universities for individual students but does not \np.9 \nact as a common currency for academic credit.  Moreover, the calculation of ECTS originally \ncentred on the total workload which the contact hours of a course generated, but is now moving \ntowards the achievement of learning outcomes.  Hence it makes sense to introduce a criterion \nreferenced grading scheme which would measure the achievement of these goals.  Any new system \nwould need to address the academic customs, grading processes and protocols of all the 25 states \nwithin the enlarged EU, rather than the original group of nations for whom ECTS was designed.   \nThe creation of a common framework would also require states to examine and eradicate the \ncurrent anomalies within grading methods at national level, as it is difficult to see how any supra \nnational scheme can operate fairly and equitably when there is so much variation in the grading \nsystems within individual nations.  Hence implementing a common grading system would also have \na positive effect on higher education quality assurance processes at national level, and enable \nbenchmarking and sharing of good practice between nation states.  For example, U.K. universities \nuse a system of external examiners who operate within a agreed code of practice established by the \nnational quality assurance agency for higher education to help institutions to assure and maintain \nacademic standards and ensure that their assessment processes are sound, fairly operated and in line \nwith the institution's policies and regulations.  Such a system is unknown in many other nation \nstates, where there are few administrative checks to guarantee that assessment procedures are \napplied fairly and uniformly within universities in the awarding of degrees.  However, at the \nBologna Process meeting in Berlin in 2003, the h.e. ministers recognized that robust quality \nassurance processes were \u201cat the heart of the setting up of a European Higher Education Area\u201d and \ncommitted themselves \u201cto supporting further development of quality assurance at institutional, \nnational and European level\u201d[2003, p.3].  Nevertheless introducing a common grading system, and \nensuring it is applied uniformly in individual states via assurance agencies could be problematic if it \nis construed as an infringement of academic freedom.  \nImpact on Academic freedom  \nSince the time of Humboldt, if not before, university professors have long argued the need for \npersonal academic freedom and fiercely guarded their independence.  For example, Altbach [2001, \np.205]  has opined that \u201cacademic freedom is at the very core of the mission of the University\u201d.   \nSimilarly, institutional autonomy has been a defining characteristic of a university and has included \nfreedom with respect to appointing academic staff, determining the subject curricula, admitting \nstudents, and awarding them qualifications, etc.  Consequently, universities have been less regulated \nthan other traditional areas of government funded activity.  For example, in the U.K. (and \nelsewhere) individual academics are free to decide how students\u2019 work should be graded, while \ntheir institutions are likewise free to determine how students\u2019 grades are translated into different \np.10 \ndegree classifications.  Within the United Kingdom, under the 1988 Education Reform Act (Section \n202) academic freedom within pre-1992 universities is safeguarded by the University \nCommissioners who are tasked: \n\u2022 to ensure that academic staff have freedom within the law to question and test received \nwisdom, and to put forward new ideas and controversial or unpopular opinions, without \nplacing themselves in jeopardy of losing their jobs or privileges they may have at their \ninstitutions \n\u2022 to enable qualifying institutions to provide education, promote learning and engage in \nresearch efficiently and economically; and  \n\u2022 to apply the principles of justice and fairness.  \nHowever, as Ashby [1966] has noted: \u201cThe question as to what constitutes academic freedom in \nuniversities is anything but unambiguous, and the patterns of autonomy which satisfy academics in \ndifferent countries are very diverse\u201d [p.293].  Nevertheless, although academic freedom may enjoy \nmany forms, most writers on the subject (and their fellow academics) are concerned with asserting \nand protecting academic freedom, rather than mapping out its limits.  One exception is Shils [1995, \np.6], who argued that \u201cthe justification of academic freedom is that it protects the moral and \nintellectual integrity of the teacher\u201d but that \u201cthere are certain activities performed (or not \nperformed) by academics which are not entitled to the right of academic freedom.  These include \u2026 \ndeliberate distortion and favouritism in marking examinations\u201d [p.8].  Continuing to use a particular \ngrading system, in the knowledge that it (dis)advantages one group of students over another, may be \nless culpable than deliberate favouritism in marking, but is none the less undesirable.  As one \neminent American scholar has astutely observed: \u201cAcademic freedom means a great deal, but it \nshould not mean freedom from responsibility to students\u201d [Kennedy, 1995, p.12].  A unified \ngrading system, at national and European levels, by its very generality, would be more transparent \nthan the existing mix of grading mechanisms.  This would make the abuse of academic freedom, \nthrough favouritism in marking, much less likely, as well as helping to ensure that the principles of \njustice and fairness, deemed central to academic freedom in the British context, and elsewhere, are \nupheld in the interests of staff and students alike. \nConclusion \nThe very complex but successful introduction in January 2002 of the Euro currency as a common \nfiduciary issue to replace the diverse monetary systems that existed, and enable a free flow of goods \nand services across the European area, demonstrates that such central reforms are both possible and \nbeneficial.  In a like fashion, \u201cin a Knowledge Economy, those institutions which stand at the heart \nof generating knowledge also occupy a central place in that economy\u201d [Neave, 2002, p.331].   \np.11 \nHence, to maximize the returns of the emerging European knowledge economy, universities need to \nmake knowledge and qualifications readily portable across borders and between states.  The \nmobility of knowledge would benefit greatly from having a common currency of uniform academic \ngrades and thereby portable qualifications, enabling free flow for the knowledge of its citizens with \nresultant increases in student and labour mobility.  This initial exercise demonstrates a unified \ngrading system is feasible, and would have beneficial integrative effects, yet would affirm rather \nthan erode academic freedom.  Hence the author is happy to repeat the plea made by one of the \nrespondents who supplied the data which made this exercise possible: \u201cCould you please conclude \nyour research with a recommendation that Europe needs a pan-European grading scale!\u201d \n \nReferences \nADAM, S.
