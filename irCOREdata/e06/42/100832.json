Reed\nAbstract\u2014This paper reports a theoretical analysis of novel op-\ntically switched arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) based on a\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform using phase modulation. The\nphase modulation can be achieved by integrating optical phase\nmodulators across the grating arms, incorporating four-way split-\nters and combiners to reduce the thermal optic effect. The phase\nmodulator operates by injecting the free carriers to change the\nrefractive index in the guiding region, hence allowing different\nwavelengths to route to different output waveguides. Also, with ap-\npropriate absorption caused by the free carriers, optical switching\ncan be performed. We demonstrate by computer simulation the\noptical and electrical characteristics of the devices using a three-\ndimensional (3-D) beam propagation method (BPM) (optical) and\nthe two-dimensional (2-D) device simulation package SILVACO\n(electrical). The drive current necessary for switching the wave-\nlength in question by one waveguide distance is approximately\n0.17 mA\/\u00b5m and the attenuation factor is approximately 1 dB.\nThese devices are useful for broad application in both wavelength-\ndivision multiplexing (WDM) networks and photonics integrated\ncircuits.\nIndex Terms\u2014Arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs), beam split-\nter, phase modulation, silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon photonics.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHE need for additional functionality and reduction in di-mensions has driven research in arrayed waveguide grat-\nings (AWGs) to integrate with various optical components to\ncope with the emerging increase in data content in optical\nnetworks. This creates a strong demand for low-cost reconfig-\nurable optical add\u2013drop multiplexer\u2013demultiplexer (ROADM).\nThe ability to handle a large capacity of wavelengths in an AWG\nis the key factor in multiple wavelengths routing within the pho-\ntonic circuitry. Various devices based on AWG for increased\nfunctionality have been proposed and demonstrated; one early\nexample is the 4\u00d7 4 optical matrix switch for the photonic cell\nswitching at 10 Gb\/s in silica-based waveguides [1]. Recently,\nIto et al. [2] demonstrated an eight-channel AWG for multi-\nchannel block switching.\nAn AWG in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) is of particular inter-\nest because of both its technology and material advantages com-\npared to some other technologies, the high index contrast in SOI\nsignifies a small device and better optical confinement within the\nManuscript received October 31, 2005; revised September 14, 2006.

Ultra-compact devices have been demonstrated in\nphotonic wires [3], [4] but the practicability depends on the qual-\nity of the waveguides, in particular the sidewall roughness [5].\nIn contrast, optical devices based on small cross-sectional SOI\nrib structures are capable of satisfying both single-mode and\nzero-birefringence conditions simultaneously [6]. Different SOI\noptical components have been previously demonstrated, such as\nphase modulators [7] and AWG [8]. We ask if we can achieve\nadditional functionality by integrating various components and\nprovide optical switching capability.\nIn this paper, we propose an optically switched SOI AWG\nby integrating optical phase modulators combined with four-\nway optical splitters and combiners to reduce the thermo-optic\neffect (TOE) and decrease the complexity of the device. The\nSOI AWG demultiplexer has been experimentally demonstrated\npreviously [8], [9]. The wavelengths at the output waveguides\nare dependent on the optical phase condition. For the case of a\nwavelength router\/switching AWG, implementing optical phase\nmodulators across the grating arms of the AWG can change the\noptical phase slightly that results in the shift of the wavelength\nat different output waveguides. However, due to a large num-\nber of array waveguides, it is inefficient to implement a phase\nmodulator on each grating arm that could induce undesired\nTOE. To overcome such a problem, a multiple beam splitter and\ncombiner can be incorporated. This method is compatible with\nthe standard CMOS fabrication processing and no additional\nprocessing step is required. We demonstrate an analysis of the\ndevice via computer simulation, and illustrate the switching\nmechanism by integrating a phase modulator. The dc transient\nand optical characteristics of a low-loss single-mode optical\nphase modulator based on SOI material are reported. We pro-\npose a multiple-beam splitter\/combiner using a coupling effect\nto evenly distribute the optical power into each waveguide arm,\nthereby reducing the number of phase modulators needed for\nperforming the phase control mechanism.\nII. SOI RIB STRUCTURE\nAccording to Chan et al. [10], an SOI rib waveguide in its\nsubmicron dimensions has to satisfy the following condition in\norder to achieve single mode and zero birefringence conditions:\nW\nH\n\u2265 0.05 + (0.92 + 0.25H)r\u221a\n1\u2212 r2 (1)\nwhere W is the width of the waveguide, H is the guiding layer,\nand r is the aspect ratio that has been defined in [10].\nThis condition assumes that high-order vertical modes con-\nfined under the rib waveguides were coupled to the outer slab\nregion during propagation, in turn yielding a high propagation\n1077-260X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2006 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The rib waveguide inher-\nently exhibits both majority and minority components that can\nbe shown by the full-vectorial equation expressed in terms of its\ntransverse field components, namely, TE and TM, as[\nPxx Pxy\nPyx Pyy\n] [\nEx\nEy\n]\n= \u03b22\n[\nEx\nEy\n]\n(2)\nwhere \u03b22 is the eigenvalue, Ex and Ey are the electric fields\nin the x- and y-directions, and Pxx, Pxy , Pyx , and Pxy are the\ndifferential operators. This implies that the eigenmodes of such\nan optical waveguide are usually in a hybrid configuration (both\nmajor and minor components co-exist). Due to the small di-\nmension of the rib waveguides proposed in this paper, the mi-\nnority component cannot be considered as negligible as in the\ncase of large cross-section rib structures [11]. Consequently, the\nfull-vectorial approach is used for the computation of the prop-\nagation mode for a waveguide feature size smaller than several\nmicrometers. The presence of the minor component needs to be\ntaken into consideration, since the minority field component has\nthe potential of changing the absolute value of the effective index\nfor a small waveguide cross section. If the waveguide structure\nis designed such that either the major or minor component is\ndiminutive, then (2) can be approximated as\nPxxEx = \u03b22xEx (3)\nPyyEy = \u03b22yEy . (4)\nThus, the transverse field components are decoupled and pro-\nvide a good approximation for the solution while preserving the\ndominant polarization effect. The birefringence condition for\nthe polarization-independent waveguide is that the difference\nbetween the effective indices of the TE and TM fundamen-\ntal modes (NTE \u2212NTM) is zero. Full-vectorial computation\nis conducted to determine single-mode and zero birefringence\nwaveguide geometries. Therefore, polarization is assumed to be\nnegligible in our device.\nIII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nFig. 1 shows a general schematic of an optically switched\nAWG. The phase condition for the optical field across the grating\narms is given as\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\nne\ufb00(\u2206L + d sin \u03b8) (5)\nwhere ne\ufb00 is the effective index of the waveguide, \u03bb is the\ncenter wavelength, d is the array waveguides separation, \u2206L is\nthe path length difference of the array waveguides, and \u03b8 is the\ndispersion angle that can be calculated by sin(sout\/R), where\nsout is the output waveguide separation.\nIn order to perform the cyclic wavelength routing behavior\n(shifting output wavelength to the adjacent waveguides), the\nphase condition has to be carefully manipulated by controlling\nthe applied bias on the phase modulator. This manipulated phase\ncondition can be written as\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\nne\ufb00(d sin \u03b8). (6)\nFrom (5), \u2206L will remain constant; hence, the phase condi-\ntion for switching depends on the small variation in the disper-\nsion angle as calculated in [12]. This will give a phase condition\nof approximately \u03c0\/2 rad needed for the wavelength routing.\nBy substituting the phase condition into (7), the active length L\nof the phase modulator can be obtained by the carrier concen-\ntration. Simplifying\n\u2206\u03c6 =\n2\u03c0\u2206nL\n\u03bb\n(7)\nwhere L is the active length of the modulator in z-direction\nand \u2206n is the change in the refractive index due to the injected\ncarriers. \u2206n, at \u03bb = 1.55 \u00b5m, can be determined by [13]\n\u2206n = \u2206ne + \u2206nh\n= \u22128.8\u00d7 10\u221222(\u2206Ne)\u2212 8.5\u00d7 10\u221218(\u2206Nh)0.8 (8)\nwhere \u2206ne and \u2206nh are the changes in the refractive indexes\nresulting from the changes in the free electron and hole car-\nrier concentrations, respectively. The changeability in the free\ncarrier concentration will result in a change in the absorption\nexpressed as\n\u2206\u03b1 = \u2206\u03b1e + \u2206\u03b1h\n= 8.5\u00d7 10\u221218(\u2206Ne) + 6.0\u00d7 10\u221218(\u2206Nh) (9)\nwhere \u2206\u03b1e and \u2206\u03b1h are the changes in the absorptions re-\nsulting from the changes in the free electron and hole carriers,\nrespectively. According to (5), the phase requirement has to be\n2m\u03c0 in order for the optical beams to focus at the respective\nposition at the output plane. It is obvious that if a shift in the\noutput position of the spectrum is required, the phase condition\nspecified by (5) needs to be altered. Thus, to enable the wave-\nlength in question to shift by q (where q is an integer) waveguide\ndistances, it is necessary to create a slight change in the phase\nacross the grating arms for different dispersion angles according\nto (6).\nTo perform optical switching, total attenuation of the optical\npower across the grating arms is needed. This is dependent on\nthe absorption coefficient of (9). Hence, to evaluate the dopant\nconcentration required for switching, the spatial light imping-\ning on the array waveguides has to be resolved. It is assumed\nthat the optical field progression across the star coupler from\nthe input waveguide is Gaussian. This spatial distribution in the\nfocal plane can be obtained by the spatial Fourier transform in\nthe paraxial approximation method [14]. The fundamental mode\nprofile of the center input waveguide can be assumed as a nor-\nmalized Gaussian power function. The spatial light distribution\nimpinging on the array waveguides is given as [15]\nI(xi) =\n4\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\nw2i\n\u03b12\nexp[\u2212(\u03c0wi(xi\/f))2] (10)\nwhere wi is the mode field radius with respect to the waveguide\nin question and f is the focal length product in Fourier optics\npropagation given in [14]\nf =\n\u03bbR\nns\n(11)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

General schematic of an optically switched AWG. Optical phase modulators are integrated at the mid-section of the grating arms, incorporating a four-way\npower splitter\/combiner.\nwhere R is the focal length and ns is the effective index of the\nslab. Hence, we obtain the spatial field distribution and focal\nplane relation. This spatial field distribution will help evaluate\nthe dopant concentration required for the total attenuation for\nthe application of \u201con\/off\u201d switching. The analysis in (10) is\nsufficient enough for evaluating the normalized field distribu-\ntion amplitude to create acceptable absorption caused by free\ncarriers, as has been shown previously [8]. However, modeling\nand simulation of the entire AWG should employ more accurate\nsimulation techniques, such as in [16].\nA. AWG\nThe AWG is designed according to the approach of Amersfoot\n[17]. The AWG is configured as a 1\u00d7 4 demultiplexer with array\nwaveguides and output waveguides separation set at 2.5 and\n5 \u00b5m, respectively. The focal length is 104.01 \u00b5m and the path\nlength difference \u2206L is 18.62 \u00b5m. These equate to a channel\nspacing \u2206\u03bb of 10 nm and a free spectral range (FSR) of 40 nm.\nSuch a definition will demonstrate the AWG cyclic properties,\nwhich provides important additional functionality compared to\nthe simple multiplexers or demultiplexers and plays a key role\nin more complex devices.\nThe simulated transmission spectra of the 1\u00d7 4 AWG de-\nmultiplexer are shown in Fig. 2. The response indicates a cyclic\nproperty, where the spectra is repeated every 40 nm that corre-\nsponds to the FSR of AWG. Fig. 3(a)\u2013(d) shows the transmission\nspectra of four-channel AWG plotted against the image plane\ndistance. Fig. 3(a) illustrates the spectra response of the AWG\nwithout any phase alteration. It can be noted that the wave-\nlengths \u03bb1 and \u03bb4 will focus at a distance of \u00b17.5 \u00b5m away\nfrom the origin and \u03bb2 and \u03bb3 will focus at \u00b12.5 \u00b5m, which\nFig. 2. Simulated response of a 1\u00d7 4 AWG demultiplexer at order m and\nm + 1; the response displayed periodicity and after each 2\u03c0 change in \u2206\u03c6, the\nfield is repeated.\ncorresponds to the two inner output waveguide positions. If the\nphase condition is implemented for different dispersion angles\naccording to the output waveguide locations, then each of the\ntransmission spectra will focus at a position corresponding to the\nappropriate output waveguides. Hence, for dispersion angles of\n2.75\u25e6, 5.5\u25e6, and 8.25\u25e6, the spectra will shift by distances of 5, 10,\nand 15 \u00b5m, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3(b)\u2013(d). The shift in\nthe distance indicates the respective output waveguide locations\nwhere waveguide separation is designed at 5 \u00b5m. This displays\na potential capability for simultaneous wavelength switching.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on May 26, 2009 at 10:21 from IEEE Xplore.

Optical Phase Modulator\n1) Device Structure: The device structure of the phase mod-\nulator is shown in Fig. 4. It is a lateral optical phase modulator\nintegrated into a low-loss SOI rib waveguide. The device is a\ntwo-terminal p-i-n structure where both n and p regions were\nmodeled as highly doped regions with constant doping concen-\ntrations of 1020 cm\u22123, based around an overall silicon thickness\nof 1 \u00b5m with etched rib waveguides 0.49-\u00b5m wide and an etch\ndepth of 0.65 \u00b5m. They are predicted to exhibit single-mode\noperation and zero birefringence [10]. Furthermore, oxide iso-\nlation trenches are employed on either side of the doping regions\nto improve injection efficiency, following Hewitt et al. [14].\n2) Electrical and Optical Models: The two-dimensional\n(2-D) ATLAS device simulation package from SILVACO [18]\nhas been used to predict the dc and transient characteristics\nof the modulator. The simulator numerically predicts internal\nphysics and device characteristics of semiconductor devices by\nsolving Poisson\u2019s equation and the charge continuity equations\nfor holes and electrons. The software allows a complete sta-\ntistical approach (Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics) when instances such\nas heavily doped regions are considered. Shockley\u2013Reed\u2013Hall\nFig. 4.

Contact pads were\nassumed to be ohmic in nature and, hence, carry no additional\ncontact resistance or capacitance. The main parameters used in\nthe simulations are listed in Table I. From the dc and transient\nsimulations, ATLAS calculates the injected free carrier concen-\ntrations in the intrinsic region of the devices for both dc and\ntransient biasing conditions. The change in the concentration of\nfree carriers is then converted to the refractive index change in\nthe device by using (8). This approach has been validated in the\npast by various authors (e.g., [7], [19]\u2013[21]). In order to maxi-\nmize this change, we must optimize the interaction between the\ninjected free carriers and the propagating optical mode.\nFollowing the work of Png et al. [7], it was determined that a\nhigh degree of uniformity exists in the injected carrier concen-\ntration at the levels of interest throughout the central guiding\nregion of the device. This results in a uniform refractive index\nchange across the waveguiding region. After obtaining the mean\nvalue of the injected carrier concentration in the guiding region,\nwe applied the results to (8) and (9) to obtain the resulting\nchanges in the refractive index and absorption for the device un-\nder investigation at a wavelength of \u03bb = 1.55 \u00b5m. Alternatively,\nthe data from the electrical simulation could be transferred to\na similar grid-based optical simulator to predict absorption and\nrefractive index changes, but due to the uniform nature of the\ninjected charge there should be negligible difference between\nthese approaches.\nThe proposed modulator structure in Fig. 4 was not shown to\nhave any surface passivation. In actual fabrication and deploy-\nment, this is not the case as the passivation oxide is required to:\n1) provide protection for the physical integrity of the optical\nwaveguide structure;\n2) allow metal connections to be made for subsequent elec-\ntrical connection;\n3) act as insulation between metal contacts for different con-\ntact regions;\n4) reduce surface recombination at the silicon interface.\nA likely candidate for the surface passivation could be ther-\nmally grown silicon dioxide (e.g., [21], [22]). Due to the abrupt\ndiscontinuity of the lattice structure at the surface, a large num-\nber of localized energy states or generation-recombination cen-\nters may be introduced at the surface region [23]. In our case, we\nconsidered the interface recombination in our simulation model\nwith a recombination speed of 100 cm\/s that corresponds to ther-\nmally grown SiO2, as is typical in an actual fabrication scenario.\nThe three-dimensional (3-D) beam propagation method\n(BPM) was used for calculating the modal field profile and\noptical losses due to carrier absorption. From the values of\nthe electron and hole concentrations at any point of the p-i-n\nFig. 5. Phase modulation against drive current and its associated I\u2013V\ncharacteristics.\nstructure, which were determined using the electrical model de-\nscribed earlier, the induced real refractive index change (\u2206n)\nand the optical absorption change (\u2206\u03b1) produced by the free\ncarrier dispersion (highly doped and injected carrier regions) at\n\u03bb = 1.55 \u00b5m can be determined by (8) and (9), respectively.\nAlso, the change in the refractive index results in a phase shift\n\u2206\u03c6 in the optical mode can be approximated by (7). Thus, we\ncan rearrange (7) to solve for \u2206n and determine the required\nrefractive index change and, hence, the required carrier density\nto achieve the desired amount of phase shift for a certain de-\nvice length or vice versa. Unless otherwise stated, the active\nmodulator length is assumed to be 500 \u00b5m.\n3) Result and Discussion: From Fig. 5, the change in the\nrefractive index and, hence, phase change varies nonlinearly\nwith the applied current (black line). One factor that contributes\nto the nonlinearity of the change in the phase versus current\ndensity relation is the sublinear dependence of the change in\nthe free holes, \u2206Nh with the change in the refractive index, as\nshown in (8). Also, as the modulator is driven harder, more free\ncarriers are injected into the intrinsic region of the device. This\nincrease in the concentration of the previously intrinsic region\nresults in an increase in the Auger recombination rate (at the\ninjected carrier concentrations much greater than 1017 cm\u22123,\nthe Auger recombination becomes the dominant recombination\nprocess, e.g., [19]). This results in a reduced lifetime in this\nregion and, hence, we have to drive the modulator harder to\nachieve an equivalent refractive index change than at lower drive\npowers. Of course, an increase in the recombination rate will\nresult in a faster switching device, i.e., reduction in the rise and\nfall times of the modulator. The associated I\u2013V characteristics\nof the optical diode (gray line) are included.

Phase modulation versus transient time. The rise time is the limiting\ntransition and, hence, determines the device operating speed.\nA transient modeling solution was employed. Both anode\nand cathode were first zero biased for 10 ns, followed by a step\nincrease to V\u03c0 for 200 ns, and a subsequent step decrease to 0\nV. V\u03c0 is the voltage corresponding to 180\u25e6 phase shift. The rise\ntime tr is defined as the time required for the induced phase shift\nto change from 10% to 90% of the maximum value. Likewise,\nthe fall time tf is defined as the time required for the induced\nphase shift to change from 90% to 10% of the maximum value.\nFor the modulator shown in Fig. 4, the rise and fall times were\ndetermined to be tr = 2.0 ns and tf = 0.82 ns, respectively.\nFig. 6 shows the rise and fall times and it is clear that the rise\ntime is the slower of the two and, hence, the limiting transition.\nIn order to clearly illustrate both the rise and fall times, a \u201cbreak\u201d\nin the horizontal time axis was made so that the rising and falling\nedges of the transient waveform could be highlighted.\nThe doped regions were positioned far from the rib\n(0.75 \u00b5m) so that the significant overlap with the optical mode\nis minimized, resulting in approximately 0.1 dB of passive op-\ntical loss. The price for this low loss translates to a slow device\nspeed. This is necessary in order to ease implementation into\nAWG devices and minimize optical attenuation.\nThe active optical absorption is defined as the device op-\ntical propagation loss at various switching bias points of in-\nterest and is attributed to the additional absorption loss due\nto the injected electrons and holes. The number of injected\ncarriers in the waveguiding region is 2\u00d7 1017, 4.53\u00d7 1017,\nand 7.2\u00d7 1017 cm\u22123 for switching at 0.5\u03c0, \u03c0, and 1.5\u03c0\nrad, respectively. In turn, the absorption coefficient \u03b1 is\n2.9\u2212, 6.6\u2212, and 10.4 cm\u22121, respectively (i.e., \u223c12.6,\u223c 28.5,\nand \u223c45.34 dB\/cm, respectively).\nIt should be noted that the modulator device speed reported\nhere is rather modest and nowhere near one of the fastest re-\nported recently [22]. Nonetheless, the device switching perfor-\nmance can be improved without changing its physical dimen-\nsions by overdriving during the device rise and fall times [7].\nThis method was recently employed by Xu et al.

Multiple Beam Splitters\nFig. 7 shows the schematic of the four-way beam com-\nbiner\/splitter using waveguide couplers, which will be imple-\nmented across the grating section of the AWG. The beam com-\nbiner\/splitter consists of a straight waveguide, which acts as the\nmodulating arm and four S-bends. Each of the S-bends com-\nprises a variable input section Lin, and the length of Lin depends\non the waveguide separation d.\nThe total length of the S-bend is given by\nLS-bend = 2Lin +\n(\n2\u03c0\u03b8bendR\n360\n)\n(12)\nwhere \u03b8bend is the angle and R is the radius of the bend,\nrespectively.\nThe grating arms are arranged in groups of four in this partic-\nular case, and the optical phase modulator is located at the center\nof the straight waveguide. The optical power coupled from the\nfree space region to the array waveguides will be combined to\nthe straight waveguide where phase manipulation occurs after\nwhich the optical power will be split equally to the array waveg-\nuides in question.

Simulated result of the multiple beam splitter and combiner with\n1.5-dB excess loss.\ncan be easily compensated for by adding the optical path length\nwithin the grating arms. The splitter is modeled using the 3-D\nBPM propagation method. The simulation only considered TE\npolarization and assumed the rib structure to be polarization-\nindependent. For a combiner, an inverted symmetrical configu-\nration is proposed and it is assumed that the optical operation\nis similar to that of a splitter with the appropriate optimization\nnecessary for the length Lin.\nThe output separation s is 2.5 \u00b5m where coupling will be\nnegligible and the S-bends are placed at 0.4 \u00b5m distance away\nfrom their neighbors. Fig. 8 shows the simulated results for the\nproposed splitter\/combiner, and it can be observed that the op-\ntical power is equally distributed across the four S-bends with\neach waveguide receiving a quarter of the optical power, com-\nbined at a later stage. Excess loss of the splitter and combiner\nis estimated to be 1.5-dB that is an acceptable benchmark. The\nstraight waveguide acts as a modulation arm where the phase of\nthe optical mode will be altered according to the phase require-\nment, as indicated in Section III-B.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe demand for the high functionality in AWG has lead to\nthe investigation of simultaneous optical switching to ensure\nflexibility and survivability of the optical systems. The factors\nthat probably dominate such phenomenon are integrations of\nboth active and passive optical components within the AWG for\nsupporting diverse applications. The trend to device miniatur-\nization also fuels the need to use high index contrast material,\nsuch as the SOI, to produce smaller structures and better optical\nconfinement.\nWe have demonstrated the cyclic property of AWG, which is\nuseful for optical switching, by deploying a phase modulation\nmechanism within the grating region. Such a mechanism can\nbe analyzed using the 2-D semiconductor simulation package\nSILVACO to investigate the device characteristics, namely\nthe dc and transient behavior of the active region of the\nmodulator. The proposed device also includes multiple beam\nsplitters\/combiners to facilitate the modulation functionality of\nthe optical mode within the array waveguides, hence, reducing\nthe number of phase modulators required, and simplifies\nfabrication.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
