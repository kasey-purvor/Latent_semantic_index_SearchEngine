Included in this data was the degree to \nwhich pupils in England at the end of their secondary education \u2018liked\u2019 or \u2018disliked\u2019 \ndifferent subjects, and their expected examination grades in these subjects.  Our study \nfocused on the perceptions of pupils in the science subjects of biology, chemistry and \nphysics.  Using the available data, we were able to analyse the perceptions of a large \nnumber of pupils (e.g. 9,827 pupils in 2004) who took examinations in the separate \nsciences.  The study found that physics was perceived as the least popular science, \nparticularly by female pupils.  Using regression analysis, we found that the expected \ngrade in a particular science subject correlated quite strongly (Spearman\u2019s rho of \naround 0.5) with the liking of that subject.  These expected grades were found to be \nthe lowest in physics, again particularly for female pupils.  We therefore concluded \nthat in order to redress the gender imbalance in physics, we need to tackle this \nproblem that physics is perceived as difficult by female pupils. \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \n \nThe declining number of students choosing to take physics during their further studies \ncontinues to be a cause for concern for scientific and educational communities around \nthe world.  In England and Wales, whilst the numbers taking Advanced Level physics \nfell by 38% between 1985 and 2004 (AQA, 2004a), the numbers taking chemistry and \nbiology rose by 8% and 30% respectively.  In Scotland, the number of students taking \nphysics in the Scottish Higher Grade examinations fell by 30% between 1985 and \n2003, although comparable falls in numbers also took place in chemistry (38%) and \nbiology (27%) (SQA, 1986-2004).  In the United States, the number of students \ncompleting bachelor degrees in physics fell by 16% during the period 1985 to 2001, \ncompared to a decrease of 8% for chemistry and an increase of 58% in the biological \nsciences (National Science Foundation\/Division of Science Resources Statistics, \n2004).  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data over \nthe period 1998 to 2003 (OECD, 2005) showed that in Germany, Ireland, South \nKorea, Mexico, Netherlands and Spain, there was a fall in the number of graduates \nfrom degree and advanced research programmes in physical sciences (including \nphysics and chemistry).  Over the same period, there was a rise in the number of \ngraduates from biological sciences in these countries.  One of the concerns is that this \ndecline in student numbers may lead to a lack of suitably qualified persons for \nindustry, and specialist physics teachers for schools and colleges (Institute of Physics, \n2004).   \n \nAnother important concern is the lack of female students going on to study physics.  \nIn England and Wales, of those studying Advanced Level chemistry, the proportion of \nfemale students has risen from around 40% to 50% between 1986 and 2004, and the \nproportion studying biology has remained at around 60%.  In physics however, the \nproportion of female students has remained largely unchanged at around 23% (Figure \n1).   \n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nYear\nPr\nop\nor\ntio\nn \nof\n s\ntu\nde\nnt\ns \n(F\nem\nal\ne)\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 1: Proportion of female students studying A-level sciences (AQA, 2004b) \n 3\nSimilarly, the proportion of female physics students in Scottish Higher examinations \n(Figure 2) and in bachelor degrees in the United States (Figure 3) has remained far \nbelow the percentages in biology and chemistry.  Concern for the fact that far fewer \ngirls were choosing to study physics compared to boys was expressed in the meeting \nof the European Physics Colloquium in 2000 (Coughlan, 2000).  In the recent 14-19 \nEducation and Skills White Paper (DfES, 2005a), the UK Government specifically \nhighlighted the gender gap in physics with a call to \u201caddress the particular problem of \npoor uptake of physics among girls\u201d. \n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nYear\nPr\nop\nor\ntio\nn \nof\n s\ntu\nde\nnt\ns \n(F\nem\nal\ne)\nBiology\nChemistry \nPhysics\n \nFigure 2: Proportion of female students studying Scottish Higher sciences (SQA, 1986-2004) \n \n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n   1985      1987      1989      1991      1993      1995      1997      1999      2001   \nYear\nPr\nor\nop\nrt\nio\nn \nof\n s\ntu\nde\nnt\ns \n(F\nem\nal\ne)\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 3: Proportion of female students attaining science bachelor degrees in the U.S. (National \nScience Foundation\/Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2004) \n 4\n The subject of this paper \n \nIn this paper, we examine the issue of the popularity of physics amongst pupils in \nEngland, specifically those in their penultimate year of secondary education.  In \nEngland and Wales, pupils attend secondary school from the ages of 11 to 16, referred \nto as Years 7 to 11.  In Year 10, pupils choose the subjects in which they subsequently \nsit the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations at the end of \nYear 11.   Pupils are awarded different grades of A*, A, B and so on down to a grade \nof G, and then finally a grade of U for an unclassified grade.  \n \nIt is compulsory that pupils study science for their GCSE examinations. However, \nthey do have a choice of different GCSE science examinations that they can sit.  At \nthe present time, students usually choose one of three options for studying science.    \nFirst of all, students can take GCSE qualifications in the separate sciences of biology, \nchemistry and physics.  However, it is more likely that students choose to study for \nthe Double Award Science qualification, which combines the study of biology, \nchemistry and physics-related topics, but in less depth than in the separate sciences.  \nThis option leads to the awarding of two GCSE qualifications.  Finally, students can \nopt to study for the Single Award Science qualification.  This is worth one GCSE \nqualification, and again combines biology, chemistry and physics-related topics, but \nwhich has a reduced curriculum content compared to the Double Award Science.   \n \nIn order to examine the views of pupils in these final years of secondary education, \nthis paper draws on data obtained by the YELLIS project, run by the CEM Centre at \nDurham University.  In a typical year, the YELLIS project (YELLIS stands for Year \n11 Information System) involves around 1,200 schools, with roughly 200,000 pupils.  \nSchools involved in the YELLIS project register voluntarily to take part in the data \ncollection exercise.  YELLIS provides secondary schools in England with feedback \non how their pupils perform in GCSE examinations.  In order to do this, YELLIS uses \na test booklet to collect data on pupils\u2019 prior-achievement (via a vocabulary and \nmathematics test), the attitudes of pupils to their studies, and some information on \ntheir social background.  This data collection is carried out with the schools involved \nat the start of Year 10.  At the end of Year 11, the GCSE examination results for the \npupils in these schools are collected, and a comparison can be made between the \nschools involved of pupils\u2019 achievement in each subject. \n \nAs part of the data collection process, the YELLIS questionnaire examines the degree \nto which Year 10 students \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018dislike\u2019 different science subjects (along with \nother subjects) that are taken at GCSE level; Double Award Science, Single Award \nScience and also the separate sciences of physics, chemistry and biology.  This is \ndone through a single questionnaire item for each subject, with a choice of one of the \nresponses from \u2018Dislike very much\u2019, \u2018Dislike\u2019, \u2018Not sure\u2019, \u2018Like\u2019 and \u2018Like very \nmuch\u2019.  In addition, the questionnaire asks pupils for the GCSE grades (A* through to \nU) which they expect to achieve in the different science subjects.  As the YELLIS \ndata is collected in the first term of Year 10, this data provides an indication of how \npupils perceive the sciences at the start of their GCSE studies, both in terms of their \nexpected attainment and their liking for different subjects.   \n \n 5\nOne of the advantages of examining such a large dataset is that data has been obtained \nfrom a large number of pupils doing the separate sciences, rather than the more \ncommonly taken Double Award Science.  Therefore, we can use YELLIS data to \nspecifically examine the attitudes of pupils towards these separate science subjects.  \nThis paper therefore describes the analysis of this YELLIS data, and what the data \ntells us about how Year 10 pupils perceive the different science subjects.  \n \n \nAnalysis of the data \n \nLiking or disliking the science subjects \n \nIn analysing the YELLIS data, we first of all examined the extent to which pupils \n\u2018liked\u2019 or \u2018disliked\u2019 the different sciences.  Table 1 shows the responses for the cohort \nof pupils completing their GCSE examinations in 2004.  In this paper, the year that is \ngiven for any particular cohort will refer to when they sat their examinations, rather \nthan when they filled in the YELLIS questionnaire.   \n \nTable 1: Percentage of pupils giving each response for the three science subjects (2004 data) \nSubject N Dislike very \nmuch (%) \nDislike a \nlittle (%) \nNot sure \n(%) \nLike a \nlittle (%) \nLike a lot \n(%) \nBiology 9827 1.7 6.4 15.5 44.5 31.9 \nChemistry 9827 2.4 7.4 15.7 43.4 31.1 \nPhysics 9827 4.1 12.5 20.4 39.6 23.3 \n \nFor this part of the analysis, only those pupils who took the GCSE examination in \neach of the separate science subjects were included.  Also, only those pupils that \nprovided a response for how much they liked each of the sciences were included (not \nall pupils provided a rating for each subject).  This ensured that the same cohort of \npupils was being compared across the different subjects.  Data from the Department \nfor Education and Skills (DfES) in the UK (DfES, 2005b) showed that around 42,500 \npupils were entered for the GCSE physics examination in 2004.  Our figures therefore \naccounted for around 23% of all the pupils doing the separate GCSE physics \nexamination in that year. \n \nThe 2004 data showed that pupils were less likely to rate themselves as liking physics \na little or a lot (62.9%) compared to biology (76.4%) or chemistry (74.5%).  Since the \npupils\u2019 responses were in the form of ordinal data, using Friedman\u2019s ANOVA test for \nnon-parametric data showed that the variation over the three science subjects was \nstatistically significant at the 0.1% level (\u03c72 = 931.0, p < 0.001). \n \nPlotting the pupil ratings of the science subjects for different cohorts in different years \n(Figure 4), we saw that this pattern of physics being the least popular of the science \nsubjects has remained the same over recent years.  \n 6\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n li\nki\nng\n a\n li\nttl\ne \nor\n a\n lo\nt\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 4: Percentage of pupils liking each subject \u2018a little\u2019 or \u2018a lot\u2019 over recent years \n \nWe also analysed these ratings for the different sciences in terms of gender (Figure \n5). We found that whereas biology was perceived as being more liked by female \npupils compared to male pupils, the reverse was true for physics and chemistry. \nPhysics was the least popular science subject for both male and female pupils, and \nphysics was far less popular for female pupils compared to male pupils.  \n \n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n li\nki\nng\n a\n li\nttl\ne \nor\n a\n lo\nt\nBiology - Females\nChemistry - Females\nPhysics - Females\nBiology - Males\nChemistry - Males\nPhysics - Males\n \nFigure 5: Percentage of female and male pupils liking each subject \u2018a little\u2019 or \u2018a lot\u2019 over recent \nyears \n \n 7\nData for Double Award Science Pupils \n \nThe main advantage of using the YELLIS data to examine the attitudes of pupils \ntowards the sciences was the fact that because of the size of the dataset, a large \namount of data could be obtained for pupils taking the separate sciences.  However, in \nlooking at the pupils who took separate science GCSE examinations, we acknowledge \nthe fact that this sample of pupils was not representative of the overall cohort of \npupils studying GCSE science.  The vast majority of pupils experience the sciences \nthrough the Double Award Science course, rather than through the separate sciences.  \nFrom DfES figures (DfES, 2005b), 479,500 pupils took the Double Award Science \nGCSE examination in 2004, compared to around 42,000 students that took GCSE \nexaminations in the separate sciences.  Therefore, could we say anything about the \nperceptions of this larger cohort of Double Award Science pupils regarding the \nseparate strands of biology, chemistry and physics? \n \nIn fact, examining the available YELLIS data, it was found that a large number of \npupils who subsequently went on to sit the Double Award Science examination still \nprovided a rating of how much they liked physics, chemistry and biology.  We found \nthat out of 792,448 students for whom we had Double Award Science results over the \nperiod 1999 to 2004, 299,634 students gave ratings for each of biology, chemistry and \nphysics.  Therefore, we analysed this additional, conveniently available sample of \nDouble Award Science students, to see how their responses compared with those \ndoing the separate sciences.  Table 2 shows the responses for this sample of Double \nAward Science pupils in 2004. \n \nTable 2: Percentage of Double Award Science pupils giving each response for the three science \nsubjects (2004 data) \nSubject N Dislike very  \nmuch (%) \nDislike \na little (%)\nNot \nsure (%)\nLike a  \nlittle (%)\nLike a  \nlot (%) \nBiology 37747 5.3 13.3 27.5 40.9 13.0 \nChemistry 37747 6.8 16.2 29.5 37.2 10.3 \nPhysics 37747 8.0 17.9 31.8 33.7 8.6 \n \nCompared to the data for the pupils studying the separate sciences (Table 1), Double \nAward Science pupils were less likely to \u2018like\u2019 each of the sciences.  This was not \nsurprising, as we might have expected more able pupils to study the separate sciences \nwith their more in-depth coverage of the subjects.  However, once again, physics was \nthe least popular of the three science subjects amongst the Double Award Science \npupils.  This pattern has been the same, once again, over recent years (Figure 6). \n 8\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n li\nki\nng\n a\n li\nttl\ne \nor\n a\n lo\nt\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 6: How much Double Award Science pupils liked each subject over recent years \nWe can also examine the differences in the ratings between female and male pupils \ndoing the Double Award Science examination (Figure 7). \n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n li\nki\nng\n a\n li\nttl\ne \nor\n a\n lo\nt\nBiology - Female\nChemistry - Female\nPhysics - Female\nBiology - Male\nChemistry - Male\nPhysics - Male\n \nFigure 7: How much female and male Double Award Science pupils liked each subject \n \nAs for the separate sciences, physics was the least popular science for female and \nmale pupils, and physics was far less popular amongst the female pupils than amongst \nthe males.  Male pupils were also more likely to like chemistry than female pupils, \nwhereas the reverse was true for biology.   \n \nWe acknowledge the fact that this sample of Double Award Science pupils \n(amounting to 37,747 pupils in 2004, or around 8% of those taking the Double Award \nScience examination that year) was not a representative random sample.  Rather, this \n 9\nwas simply a convenient sample available to our study.  However, assuming that there \nwas no particular reason for some Double Award Science pupils giving ratings for the \nseparate sciences and some not, the pattern of results for Double Award Science \npupils were in broad agreement with those that took separate science subjects. \n \nWhat might influence a pupil\u2019s liking for a science subject? \n \nIn the above analysis, we found that for the same cohort of pupils, their liking for \nscience subjects varied with the subject itself and also with gender.  The question we \nthen asked was, given the data available to us from the YELLIS dataset, was it \npossible for us to deduce what else might influence the liking for a science subject? \n \nThe additional data that we had available to us contained the following variables: \n\u2022 The GCSE grades that pupils expected to achieve in each subject at the \nbeginning of Year 10. \n\u2022 The actual GCSE grades achieved by pupils in each subject at the end of Year \n11.  \n\u2022 A measure of general ability for each pupil, based on a vocabulary test and a \nmathematics test. \n\u2022 The year that the pupil completed their GCSE examinations. \n\u2022 The gender of the pupil.   \nBy converting the GCSE grades to numerical measures (A* = 8, A = 7, \u2026 F = 2, G = \n1, U = 0), and gender to a dichotomous variable for females and males, we calculated \nthe Spearman\u2019s rho correlation values between these various measures available to us, \nand the liking of students for the science subjects.  Spearman\u2019s rho correlation values \nwere calculated because the liking for the science subjects and the GCSE grades were \nordinal measures.  The resulting correlations are given below in Table 3 for the case \nof physics, calculated only from the data for the pupils who did the separate sciences. \n \nTable 3: Correlations of the different variables with the liking for physics \nVariable Correlation with liking for physics \nYear of examination 0.01 \nGender 0.22 \nExpected GCSE grade in physics 0.52 \nActual GCSE grade in physics 0.12 \nGeneral ability measure 0.01 \n \nWe found that the largest correlation was between the expected grade in physics and \nthe liking for the subject.  The actual GCSE grade was not strongly related to the \nliking for physics.  When we repeated the same analysis for biology and chemistry \n(using the GCSE measures for those subjects), we found each time that the expected \ngrade was similarly correlated to the liking for that subject (Table 4). \n \nTable 4: Spearman\u2019s rho values for the correlation between expected GCSE grade and the liking \nfor each science subject \nSubject Spearman\u2019s rho \nBiology 0.46 \n 10\nChemistry 0.51 \nPhysics 0.52 \n \nOf course, the analysis was restricted to the variables that we had available from the \nYELLIS dataset, and other influences (for example teacher variables) would be \nimportant as well.  However, based on the available data, we concluded that an \nimportant influence on pupils\u2019 liking of a science subject was their expectation of \nsuccess in that subject.  \n \nExpected grades in the separate sciences  \n \nBased on the above findings, we chose to further examine the expected GCSE grades \nof pupils in each of the science subjects, to see how expectations changed between \none science subject and another.  Beginning with the cohort of pupils taking the \nseparate sciences, Table 5 gives the expected grades of pupils who went on to sit their \nGCSE examinations in 2004. \n \nTable 5: Percentage of pupils expecting each GCSE grade in the separate sciences (2004 data) \nSubject N A* A B C Below C\nBiology 9588 18.1 44.8 28.6 7.7 1.0 \nChemistry 9591 18.4 41.2 29.7 9.3 1.5 \nPhysics 9582 15.9 38.4 32.0 11.7 1.9 \n \nAs can be seen from the numbers of pupils (N) in each subject, within the cohort of \npupils that provided data on how much they liked each subject (Table 1), not all these \npupils provided a response for what grade they expected in each science subject.  \nHowever, this only amounted to about a 2% non-response rate.  Amongst those that \ndid provide responses, pupils\u2019 expectations were more likely to be highest in biology \nand lowest in physics.    This perception that pupils would do least well in physics has \nbeen the same over recent years (Figure 8).   \n 11\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n E\nxp\nec\ntin\ng \nA\n* o\nr A\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 8: Percentage of pupils expecting A* or A GCSE grades in each of the three separate \nsciences \n \nAn issue to note here is the rise in the expected grades of pupils in the separate \nsciences over recent years.  One explanation for this is that schools with more able \npupils have been choosing to join the YELLIS project over this period.  In fact, there \nwas a rise in the actual GCSE grades achieved by these pupils (Figure 9), which \nmight therefore support this view.  Another possibility is that over this time, more \npupils have been achieving higher GCSE grades in the separate sciences.  In fact, \nfrom DfES data on past examination performance of all pupils who sat these separate \nscience examinations, there has only been a slight increase from 43% of pupils \nachieving A* or A grades in 1999 (DfES, 2000) to 47% in 2004 (DfES, 2005b).  \nTherefore, the former explanation for this rise in expectations is more likely to be the \ncase. \n  \n 12\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n A\nct\nua\nl A\n* a\nnd\n A\n G\nra\nde\ns\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 9: Percentage of pupils actually getting A* and A GCSE grades in the three separate \nsciences \n \nWe also examined the expected grades of male and female pupils separately (Figure \n10).   \n \n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n E\nxp\nec\ntin\ng \nA\n* o\nr A Biology - Female\nChemistry - Female\nPhysics - Female\nBiology - Male\nChemistry - Male\nPhysics - Male\n \nFigure 10: Percentage of female and male pupils expecting A* and A GCSE grades in the \nseparate sciences \n \nIn this case, male pupils were more positive about how they would do in all three of \nthe science subjects.  For physics however, we saw that the expectations were lowest \nfor both the female and male groups of pupils.  The difference between biology and \n 13\nphysics was found to be quite small for the male pupils, and more pronounced for the \nfemale pupils.   \n \nThese findings therefore showed that approximately 20% less female pupils felt that \nthey would achieve top grades in physics compared to biology.  We saw previously \nthat pupils\u2019 liking of a science subject was quite closely correlated (Spearman\u2019s rho of \naround 0.5) to their expectations in that subject.  Although we cannot attribute \ncausation from our results, other studies have shown the influence of previous \nachievement on students\u2019 attitudes towards science, rather than the other way round \n(Rennie and Punch, 1991).  Therefore, it seems likely that one of the factors that \ncontributed to female pupils liking physics less than the other science subjects was the \nlower expectation of success that they had in physics at GCSE level.  \n \nWas this lower expectation of female pupils justified?  We could examine this by \nlooking at the percentage of female and male pupils that actually obtained the top \ngrades in the three separate sciences (Figure 11). \n \n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n A\nct\nua\nl A\n* a\nnd\n A\n G\nra\nde\ns\nBiology - Female\nChemistry - Female\nPhysics - Female\nBiology - Male\nChemistry - Male\nPhysics - Male\n \nFigure 11: Percentage of female and male pupils actually getting A* and A GCSE grades in the \nseparate sciences \n \nWe found that the female pupils on average outperformed the male pupils in biology \nand chemistry, and males and females were close in actual attainment in physics.  \nTherefore, the more confident expectations of the male pupils were not justified by \nwhat they actually obtained.  However, the actual GCSE results also told us that \nfemale pupils performed least well in physics.  In this cohort, approximately 5% less \nfemale pupils achieved top grades in physics compared to biology.  Therefore, these \nfemale pupils did indeed perform the least well in physics. However, the difference \nbetween the subjects was smaller than that expected by the female pupils.  Therefore, \nfemale pupils\u2019 low expectations in physics were only partially justified by their \nresults. \n \n \n 14\nExpected grades for Double Award Science pupils \n \nHaving examined the differences in expected GCSE grades between the separate \nscience subjects and between female and male pupils, we examined the available data \nfor Double Award Science students.  We wanted to find out the expectations of pupils \nin biology, physics and chemistry for this larger cohort.   \n \nOnce again, we were able to draw on a convenient sample of pupils who, despite \ntaking Double Award Science, had provided expected grades for each of the separate \nsciences.  Of the 792,448 students that we had results for over the period 1999 to \n2004, 286,424 pupils gave expected grades for biology, chemistry and physics.  We \nwere therefore able to look at the percentages of these Double Award Science pupils \nthat were expecting A* and A grades in the three science subjects (Figure 12). \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n E\nxp\nec\nte\nd \nA\n* \nan\nd \nA\n G\nra\nde\ns\nBiology\nChemistry\nPhysics\n \nFigure 12: Percentage of Double Award Science pupils expecting A* or A GCSE grades in each \nof the three separate sciences \n \nWe found that for the Double Award Science pupils, the percentages expecting the \ntop grades were lower than for those pupils taking the separate sciences.  Assuming \nthat more able pupils were doing the separate sciences, we were not surprised to find \nthis difference between the two different cohorts.  In addition, we also found that the \npercentages of Double Award Science pupils expecting the top grades were lowest in \nphysics. This was similar to the results for the separate science students.  However, \nfor the Double Award Science pupils, the percentages for chemistry and physics were \ncloser than for the separate science pupils.  Looking at gender differences in these \nresults (Figure 13), they once again showed that the differences in the percentages for \nthe different sciences were pronounced for the female pupils only.  Approximately \n7% less female pupils thought that they would achieve a top grade in physics \ncompared to biology. \n \n 15\n010\n20\n30\n40\n50\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\nYear\n%\n A\nct\nua\nl A\n* a\nnd\n A\n G\nra\nde\ns\nBiology - Female\nChemistry - Female\nPhysics - Female\nBiology - Male\nChemistry - Male\nPhysics - Male\n \nFigure 13: Percentage of female and male Double Award Science pupils expecting A* or A GCSE \ngrades in each of the three separate sciences \n \nThe general pattern of expected GCSE grades, provided by the convenient sample of \nDouble Award Science pupils, was found to be similar to that of the separate science \npupils.  We therefore concluded that female pupils had lower expectations in physics \nthan for the other sciences, for both those studying Double Award Science and those \nstudying the separate sciences.   \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nFrom our analysis, one of the conclusions that we have reached is that physics is \nperceived less favourably than the other science subjects, the reason being that pupils\u2019 \nexpectations of success is less in physics compared to biology or chemistry.  We \nhighlighted earlier the study by Rennie and Punch (1991), which discussed the \nrelationship between attitude towards science generally and previous achievement. \nLooking at physics specifically, the possible relationship between expectations of \nsuccess, or to put it another way the perceived difficulty of the subject, has also been \nsuggested in a number of other studies.   \n \nDuckworth and Entwistle (1974), in a survey of secondary school pupils, found that \nphysics was rated both as less interesting and more difficult than either biology or \nchemistry.  In their study of undergraduate students in physics, biology and English, \nSpall et al. (2003) found that biology was seen as easier than physics by all the groups \nof students, and seen as more interesting by both the English and biology students. \nWilliams et al. (2003) found that secondary school pupils found biology more \ninteresting than physics, the predominant reason being that physics was a more \ndifficult subject.  Our study supported this finding, with our findings being based on a \nfar larger cohort of pupils (Williams et al. surveyed 317 pupils).   \n 16\n \nA second conclusion that we reached was that physics was much less likely to be \nliked by female pupils. Our findings showed that the differences that we observed \nbetween liking for physics and liking for the other sciences, in particular for biology, \nwere much more pronounced for female pupils. These findings were in broad \nagreement with the meta-analysis carried out by Weinburgh (1995).  In comparing \ngender differences in attitude toward a variety of science subjects, Weinburgh found \nan overall effect size of 0.12 for the difference in attitude between male and female \nstudents in physics, compared to an effect size of 0.03 in biology (both differences in \nfavour of male students).   \n \nOur analysis also suggested that a possible reason for the gender differences in how \nphysics and biology are perceived might be the different expectations of success in \nthose subjects. Osborne, Simon and Collins (2003), in their review of literature \nlooking at attitudes towards the sciences, highlighted the fact that the perceived \ndifficulty of science subjects seemed to be a major influence on whether pupils took \nscience subjects for their Advanced Level studies in the UK.  Therefore, the fact that \nexpectations in physics is lower for female pupils may be one of the contributory \nfactors towards the poor uptake of physics by female students in further education, as \nhighlighted in the introduction to this paper.   \n \nTherefore, if we want to improve the uptake of physics in further education courses, \nparticularly amongst female students, then we need to tackle this perception that \nphysics is more difficult than the other science subjects.  An important factor that will \nenable us to do this will be the ability of teachers to explain physics to pupils.  \nOsborne, Simon and Collins (2003) argued that for science subjects generally, \n\u201cresearch evidence shows clearly that it is the teacher variables that are the most \nsignificant factor determining attitude, not curriculum variables\u201d.  Looking at physics \nspecifically, Nielsen and Thomsen (1988), in their study of secondary pupils in \nDenmark, found that \n \n\u201cWhat has mostly struck us in the students\u2019 responses during the \ninterviews is the overwhelming consensus that the teacher is the single \nmost decisive factor in forming the students\u2019 attitudes about physics \u2026 A \n\u2018good\u2019 teacher can make an otherwise disliked subject tolerable, maybe \neven interesting, but a \u2018bad\u2019 teacher is able to kill any prior interest in the \nsubject.\u201d \n \nWoolnough (1994) also called for science to be taught by \u201cwell qualified teachers \u2026 \nwho were enthusiastic about, and expert in, the subject they were teaching\u201d.   \n \nHowever, this is where we enter a possible vicious circle, a lack of those doing \nphysics leading to a lack of suitably qualified teachers of physics.  Dillon et al. \n(2000), in their survey of primary and secondary teachers, found that 47% of those \nteaching science at primary school had no qualification at all in physics.  This was in \ncomparison to 19% that had no qualification in biology.  At secondary school, 66% of \nthose teaching GCSE science did not have a degree in physics, compared to 29% that \ndid not have a degree in biology.  Therefore, this lack of well-qualified physics \nteachers tends to suggest that little will change with regards to popularity of physics \namongst pupils.  Certainly, from our findings in this paper, we see that little has \n 17\nchanged in the past five years in the way that pupils perceive the subject.  We can \nonly hope that when return to examine this data source in the future, the situation has \nnot become even worse for physics. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank Professor Richard Gott at Durham University, and Dr \nDavid Montagu at the Royal Society, for suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.  \nThey would also like to thank those that refereed this paper for their helpful \ncomments.  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAQA (2004a) The number of entries to A-level examinations in sciences and \nmathematics 1985-2004 [online], Institute of Physics.
