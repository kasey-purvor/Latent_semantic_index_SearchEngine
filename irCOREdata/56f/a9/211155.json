Design.Prospective cohort study. Setting.A tertiary care referral hospital and regional district hospital in southeast Queensland, Australia. Patients.Adults aged 18 years or older with a minimum inpatient stay of 1 night who were admitted to selected clinical specialities. Results.Urinary tract infection was not associated with an increase in length of hospital stay or variable costs. Lower respiratory tract infection was associated with an increase of 2.58 days in the hospital and variable costs of AU$24, whereas other types of infection were associated with an increased length of stay of 2.61 days but not with variable costs.
