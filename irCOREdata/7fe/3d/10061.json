Hacker by Fr. Aloysius Hacker About the Society The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) is the UK\u2019s largest and foremost Artificial Intelligence society. It is also one of the oldest-established such organisations in the world. The Society has an international membership of hundreds drawn from academia and industry. Membership of AISB is open to anyone with interests in artificial intelligence and cognitive and computing sciences. AISB membership includes the following benefits: \u2022 Quarterly newsletter \u2022 The AISB Journal \u2022 Student travel grants to attend conferences \u2022 Discounted rates at AISB events and conventions \u2022 Discounted rates on various publications \u2022 A weekly e-mail bulletin and web search engine for AI-related events and opportunities You can join the AISB online via: http:\/\/www.aisb.org.uk Cognitive Divinity Programme Institute of Applied Epistemology AISBQ EDITORIAL BOARD Joanna Bryson University of Bath Lola Canamero University of Hertfordshire Simon Colton Imperial College London Yiannis Demiris Imperial College London Louise Dennis University of Nottingham Colin Johnson U.

In  the  past  the  convention  has  been  hosted  by a  number  of  prestigious  institutions  including  the Universities  of  Abedeen  (2008),  Newcastle  (2007), Bristol (2006), Hertfordshire (2005), Leeds (2004), Aberystwyth (2003), Imperial (2002), York (2001), Birmingham (2000), Edinburgh (1999).  It aims to function as a enue for the presentation of recent and emerging work in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science and as a productive environment for networking and the formation of collaborations.  The convention exists as a series of themed symposia and workshops together with some additional plenary talks.  Previous themes have included: Communication,  Interaction  and  Social  Intelligence (2008),  Artificial  and  Ambient  Behaviour  (2007), Adaptation in Artificial and Biological Systems (2006), Social Intelligence and Interaction in Animals, Robots and Agents (2005), Motion, Emotion and Cognition (2004), Cognition in Machines and Animals (2003), Logic,  Language  and  Learning  (2002),  Agents  and Cognition  (2001),  Artificial  Intelligence  and  Society (2000), Creativity (1999). The convention will have a convention organiser who has has overall responsibility for the convention program, local arrangements and financial management.  Program detail is mostly delegated to individual symposium organisers but the convention organiser is responsible for arranging plenary talks. Each convention has a broad theme suggested by the convention organiser within which the plenary talks  and  the  majority  of  the  symposia  should  fit. This gives organiser the opportunity to promote their research area. A  full  description  of  the  role  of  the  convention organiser  is  available  on  request  from  the  AISB secretary (secretary@aisb.org.uk) and also from the AISB Web Site MAKING A PROPOSAL Proposals should be made by emailing in plain text to Louise Dennis at secretary@aisb.org.uk, enclosing the following information. (Prior informal email enquiries from possible proposers are welcomed): Theme.  The  convention  should  have  a  theme that should try to encompass a wide range of work in both Artificial Intelligence and the Simulation of Behaviour.  A brief justification of your chosen theme indicating  why  you  believe  it  to  be  timely  should also  be  included.    Our  aim  that  over  a  period  of years  the  Convention  should  represent  the  broad spread  of  UK  research  in  Artificial  Intelligence  and Cognitive  Science  although  this  does  not  preclude the possibility that the Convention may have similar themes  in  two  successive  years.    The  committee will judge proposals in this context and may make suggestions  for  adapting  a  proposed  theme  to  fit in with this aim. Name and Affliation of the Convention Organiser - including both postal and email addresses and telephone numbers.","cites":null}],"documentType":{"type":1}},"contributors":[],"datePublished":"2007","abstract":"The University of Edinburgh and research sponsors are authorised to reproduce and distribute reprints and on-line copies for their purposes notwithstanding any copyright annotation hereon.
