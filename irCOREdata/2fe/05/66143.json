They include photoassocia-\ntion spectroscopy [1\u20134] and magnetic tuning through a\nFeshbach resonance [5,6]. An important long-range goal\nof such experiments is the production of a stable molecu-\nlar BEC. However, in most cases the molecules are pro-\nduced initially in vibrationally excited states, and their\nlifetime is limited by collisions with other atoms or\nmolecules. Since the magnetic trap depth is typically\n1 mK, any vibrationally or rotationally inelastic collision\nwill release enough kinetic energy for both collision\npartners to be ejected from the trap.\nVery little is known about vibrational relaxation rates\nfor ultracold alkali dimers. Wynar et al. [2] produced\n87Rb2 molecules in very high vibrational levels of the\nground electronic state in an atomic BEC by stimulated\nRaman scattering. They analyzed their line shapes to\nobtain an upper bound on the inelastic rate coefficient\nkinel < 8\u0004 10\u000111 cm3=s. In subsequent experiments [7]\non ultracold (but not condensed) Rb2 molecules in a\ndifferent set of vibrational levels, they measured kinel \u0002\n3\u0004 10\u000111 cm3=s. These rates are too high for the pro-\nduction of long-lived molecules, but there is a hope that\nlower-lying states will relax more slowly [8,9] and that\nmethods for stabilizing the molecules can be found.\nSeveral calculations have been carried out on the vibra-\ntional relaxation of molecules such as H2 [8,9] and CO\n[10,11] at ultralow energies. Spin-changing collisions of\nO2 have also been investigated [12,13]. However, colli-\nsions of alkali dimers present new theoretical challenges\nthat are not present for collisions of stabler molecules. In\nparticular, the potential energy surfaces are such that\nbarrierless atom-exchange reactions can occur; even if\nthe products are indistinguishable from the reactants, the\nreactive channels must be taken into account in a full\ntreatment of the collision dynamics. Barrierless reactions\nare significantly different from reactions such as F\u0005 H2\n[14], which have substantial barriers and have not yet\nbeen investigated at ultralow energies. This Letter\npresents an initial investigation of alkali \u0005 alkali dimer\ncollisions, for the case of Na\u0005 Na2 collisions occurring\non the lowest quartet surface for Na3. This corresponds\nphysically to collisions of atoms in their \u2018\u2018stretched\u2019\u2019 spin\nstates, with F \u0002 Fmax \u0002 I \u0005 S and jMFj \u0002 F.\nIn this work we use the potential energy surfaces of\nHiggins et al. [15] for the 14A02 state of Na3. Their full\n(nonadditive) potential was obtained from a grid of\nab initio calculations with a large basis set, interpolated\nusing the reproducing-kernel Hilbert space scheme of Ho\nand Rabitz [16]. The potential has a global minimum at\n\u00011222:1 K, with the atoms in an equilateral triangle\nconfiguration 4:41 \u0019A apart. The symmetric linear geome-\ntry is a saddle point at \u0001554:4 K (667.7 K above the\nminimum), with r \u0002 5:10 \u0019A. Comparison with the corre-\nsponding triplet Na2 pair potential [17], which has re \u0002\n5:192 \u0019A and De \u0002 255:7 K, shows that large nonadditive\neffects are present. In the present work, we test the\nsensitivity of our results to the potential surface by per-\nforming calculations using both the full nonadditive po-\ntential and a pairwise additive potential obtained by\nneglecting the nonadditive part.\nWe initially investigated inelastic scattering calcula-\ntions of vibrational relaxation from the v \u0002 1 state of\ntriplet Na2, using the MOLSCAT program [18]. Such calcu-\nlations are analogous to the H\u0005 H2 calculations of\nBalakrishnan et al. [8] and are carried out in Jacobi co-\nordinates \bR; r; \u0010\t for a single arrangement of the atoms.\nMOLSCAT expands the scattering wave function in basis\nfunctions that are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian for\nfree Na2. For Na\u0005 Na2, however, it proved impossible to\nconverge the basis set of Na2 vibrational functions in\nthree-dimensional inelastic scattering (close-coupling\nor coupled states) calculations. This may readily be\nVOLUME 89, NUMBER 15 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 7 OCTOBER 2002\n153201-1 0031-9007=02=89(15)=153201(4)$20.00 \uf6d9 2002 The American Physical Society 153201-1\nunderstood in terms of the potential energy surface.\nConsider Na approaching Na2 for a T-shaped geometry,\n\u0010 \u0002 90\n, allowing the Na2 bond length r to relax to\nminimize the energy at each intermolecular distance R.\nThe system passes through the minimum-energy equi-\nlateral geometry, and then the two atoms of the Na2 move\napart to allow the Na atom to insert between them.\nHowever, even at R \u0002 0 (the linear geometry), the energy\nis below that for separated Na\u0005 Na2. At this configura-\ntion, the optimum value of r is 10:4 \u0019A, and the basis set of\nNa2 vibrational functions centered around re \u0002 5:1 \u0019A is\ncompletely inadequate for representing such dramatically\nexpanded geometries.\nIt is thus essential to carry out three-dimensional re-\nactive scattering calculations, including all three atomic\narrangements. As a first step towards a rigorous treat-\nment, we have performed such calculations for total\nnuclear orbital angular momentum J \u0002 0. The configu-\nration space is divided into an inner and an outer region,\ndepending on the atom-diatom distance. In the inner\nregion, we use a formalism based on body-frame\ndemocratic hyperspherical coordinates [19]. This has pre-\nviously proved successful in describing atom-diatom in-\nsertion reactions such as N\b2D\t \u0005 H2 ! NH\u0005 H [20]\nand O\b1D\t \u0005 H2 ! OH\u0005 H [21,22]. A related approach\nhas also been used in studies of three-body recombination\nof ultracold atoms [23]. The scattering wave function is\nexpanded on a set of hyperspherical adiabatic states. This\nyields a set of close-coupling equations, which in our\nmethod are solved using the Johnson-Manolopoulos\nlog-derivative propagator [24]. In the outer region, we\nuse the Arthurs-Dalgarno formalism [25], which is based\non Jacobi coordinates. Matching of the wave functions in\nthe inner and outer regions is performed on a boundary\nwhich is an hypersphere of radius 25 \u0019A. This yields the\nreactance K matrix and the scattering S matrix.\nThe inner region starts at a hyperradius of 4 \u0019A and is\nsplit into 297 sectors. The adiabatic states in each sector\nare obtained by a variational expansion on a basis of\nhyperspherical harmonics with A1 symmetry. They are\nfully symmetric with respect to particle permutations to\naccount for the indistinguishability of atoms. At large\nhyperradius, the adiabatic states concentrate into the ar-\nrangement channels and describe Na2 molecules in even j\nstates. At small hyperradius, they span a large fraction of\nconfiguration space and allow for atom exchange. The\nhyperspherical harmonic basis is truncated at \u001dmax, the\nmaximum value of the grand angular momentum. \u001dmax\nvaries from 198 (867 harmonics) at small hyperradius to\n398 (3400 harmonics) at large hyperradius. A fixed num-\nber of 135 adiabatic states is used in the close-coupling\nexpansion in each sector. At the boundary between the\ninner and outer regions, the adiabatic states are projected\nonto a set of Na2 rovibrational states, with jmax \u0002 48, 44,\n40, 36, 30, 26, 20, 10 for vibrational levels v \u0002 0; 1; . . . ; 7.\nThe boundary between the inner and outer regions was\nplaced at a distance such that couplings due to the atom-\ndiatom residual interaction can be neglected outside the\nboundary. In the outer region, regular and irregular solu-\ntions of a radial Schro\u00a8dinger equation which includes the\nisotropic (R\u00016) part of the interaction were integrated\ninwards from very large distances (5000 \u0019A).\nFigure 1 shows the computed cross sections as a func-\ntion of collision energy for the additive and nonadditive\npotentials. All collisions that are energetically elastic,\nwith or without atom exchange, are included in the elastic\ncross section. All other processes (which produce Na2\n\bv0 \u0002 0; j0\t) contribute to the quenching cross section.\nIt may be seen that theWigner threshold laws [8,26,27]\nhold below 10\u00015 K for both potentials. The elastic cross\nsections are independent of energy in the Wigner region.\nThe cross sections are larger for the nonadditive than for\nthe additive potential, by a factor of about 10 for both\nelastic and quenching cross sections.

The value is kinel \u0002 4:8\u0004 10\u000111 cm3 s\u00011 for the\nadditive potential and 5:2\u0004 10\u000110 cm3 s\u00011 for the non-\nadditive potential. The corresponding complex scattering\nlengths [29], obtained from the diagonal element of the T\nmatrix at a kinetic energy of 10\u00019 K, are a \u0002 \b2:26\u0001\n0:80i\t and \b2:38\u0001 8:54i\t nm, respectively.\nOutside the Wigner region, the cross sections have a\nmore complicated energy dependence. The quenching\nprobability increases with increasing energy and ap-\nproaches unity at the limit of the Wigner region. The\nquenching cross sections thus vary approximately as\nE\u00011 above 10\u00014 K, because of the k\u00012 factor in the\nexpression for the cross section.\nThe values of the quenching cross sections are quite\nlarge and suggest that vibrationally excited alkali dimers\nproduced by photoassociation will usually be lost from a\nmagnetic trap in a fraction of a second. However, our\ncurrent calculations neglect the effects of nuclear spin\nand magnetic fields, which may be used to tune colli-\nsional effects. In addition, the large difference between\nthe values for the additive and nonadditive potentials\nserves to emphasise the importance of using high-quality\npotential energy surfaces in dynamical calculations.\nThe ratio of quenching to elastic cross sections is larger\nthan 1 at energies below 10\u00014 K for the additive potential\nand below 10\u00013 K for the nonadditive potential. It in-\ncreases up to 500 in the nK range for both potentials. The\nratio is not favorable for production of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate by evaporative cooling, though this may be\ncircumvented by methods that produce a molecular con-\ndensate directly [6].\nNa2 rotational levels up to j \u0002 20 are energetically\naccessible at the energy of the v \u0002 1 state (23:5 cm\u00011),\nand all accessible levels are populated in the products.\nThe product rotational distributions from calculations on\nthe additive and nonadditive potentials at 10\u00014 K are\nshown in Fig. 2. The distributions are essentially un-\nchanged at lower collision energies. Only even j products\nare formed because of the boson symmetry. For the non-\nadditive potential, there are three clear maxima in the\ndistribution, at j \u0002 4, 12, and 18. The additive potential\nalso shows an oscillatory structure, with maxima at j \u0002\n0, 8, 14, and 20. The oscillations almost certainly arise\nfrom a rotational rainbow effect [29]. The structure is\nsimilar to that observed in vibrational predissociation of\nvan der Waals complexes [30]. In a classical impulsive\nmodel, the energy released from Na2 vibration is partly\nretained in relative translation and partly converted into\nNa2 rotation. The angular momentum imparted to the Na2\nmolecule is zero if the energy is released at a linear or T-\nshaped geometry, but large around \u0010 \u0002 45\n. In this\nmodel, the oscillations arise from interference between\nclassical trajectories on either side of the maximum.\nIt is not yet computationally feasible to carry out\nreactive scattering calculations for Na\u0005 Na2 for total\nangular momentum J > 0. However, we have carried out\ncollinear inelastic scattering calculations to estimate the\ncontributions of higher partial waves. The elastic cross\nsections for partial waves l \u0002 1 and 2 are proportional to\nE2 and E3, respectively, for energies below 10\u00014 K, while\nthe inelastic cross sections are proportional to E1=2 and\nE3=2, respectively, in the same energy range. The total\ncross sections are dominated by s-wave scattering up to\nabout 10\u00013 K.\nIn future work, we intend to investigate the dependence\nof quenching rates on the initial vibrational quantum\nnumber and to investigate the effects of magnetic fields\nand nuclear spin coupling.\nThe three-dimensional quantum dynamical calcula-\ntions were performed on a NEC-SX5 vector super-\ncomputer, through a grant from the \u2018\u2018Institut du\nDe\u00b4veloppement des Ressources en Informatique\nScientifique\u2019\u2019 (IDRIS) in Orsay (France).
