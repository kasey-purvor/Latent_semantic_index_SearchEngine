The \nconstruction process of the rise of Chinese economic power puts the state in direct \ncontacts with the regional and global economic\/political changes. On the one hand, \nChinese business knowledge, identities, economic and political interactions also give \nrise to the notion of networks building and sub-regional development, which help \ntranscend country-specific relations. On the other hand, the notion of the rise of China \n                                                 \n\uf02a\n Gordon C. K. Cheung is Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of International Relations of China in the \nSchool of Government & International Affairs at the University of Durham, United Kingdom. He is \nalso the Editor-in-Chief of East Asia: An International Quarterly, a quarterly academic journal \npublished by Springer. He has published widely on Chinese diasporic studies, Chinese business \nenterprise and East Asian international political economy. He has published over 20 academic articles \nand three books. His latest book is China Factors: Political Perspectives and Economic Interactions \n(Transaction: 2007). His current research projects are on intellectual property rights and consumer \nCulture in China, and the Chinese food enterprises in the United Kingdom. This special section (except \nthe last paper which was presented earlier in the International Studies Association (ISA) 46\nth\n Annual \nConvention on March 1-6, 2005 in Hawaii) is the product of a conference held on 19-20 March 2007 at \nthe University of Durham. The conference was funded by Lee Foundation (Singapore), Universities\u201f \nChina Committee in London, Centre for Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Durham \nand Copenhagen Business School. A detail conference report can be found in Asian Studies Newsletter \nof the Association for Asian Studies, vol. 52, no. 3 (October 2007). Many thanks to the paper \npresenters and commentators who contributed to the critical debates and discussion, yet, due to \ndifferent reasons they cannot contribute their work to this special issue, Emile Kok-Kheng Yeoh, . I \nwould especially like to thank the three anonymous reviewers in reviewing papers submitted to this \nspecial section.  \n \n \n 2 \nis still being re-constructed through the interplay between regional and global political \neconomy. \n \nIn Territory, Authority, Rights: From Medieval to Global Assemblages, Saskia Sassen \nfurther questions the tension between globalization and nation-state by reminding us \nthat \u201eFor today\u201fs globalizing dynamics to have the transformative capacities they \nevince entails far deeper imbrications with the national\u2014whether governments, firms, \nlegal systems, or citizens\u2014than prevailing analyses allow us to recognise.\u201f1 Her \nthesis covers more broadly the global affairs. Yet, in East Asia, as far as business and \neconomic development are concerned, it is increasingly an imperative to look at, other \nthan the state, transnational actors\u201f activities (business practice, capital movement, \nknowledge transfer and even social and cultural traits) to understand business and \neconomic development. More importantly, the rise of China further complicates such \ntension between the national\u2014China\u2014and the transnational actors\u2014Chinese\u2014in \nunderstanding the driving force behind the economic behemoth. \n \n   There are two perspectives in looking at the rise of Chinese economy. The first \none is the notion of \u201eMade in China\u201f. This point becomes more salient after China \nbecame the member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001. This \nway of seeing refers to the identity of China as \u201ethe factory of the world\u201f which, due \n 3 \nto its huge population, market potential, cheap labours and manufacturing prowess, \ncreates a gigantic economic development, if not economic miracle.\n2\n Increasingly, \nsuch notion also creates global repugnance on the image of the health and safety \nissues attached with general household products that made in China.\n3\n China as the \nfactory of the world also symbolises the competitiveness of Chinese work force in the \ninternational market, and inevitably, it also creates some political pressure from the \nglobal (the US especially) as well as East Asian region. In a Testimony before the \nHearing on US-China Economic Relations Revisited Committee on Finance, United \nStates Senate on March 29, 2006, C. Fred Bergsten, from the Peterson Institute, \npointed out that as a result of the huge US merchandise trade and current account \ndeficits (US$900 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005) and the Chinese current \naccount surplus (US$150 billion in 2005), \u201eit is thus essential to reduce the US and \nChina imbalances by substantial amounts in an orderly manner.\u201f4 From the Asian \nPacific region, the rise of China pushes the frontier of debate beyond the conventional \nregional security stability to something more down-to-earth such as the competition \nbetween China and neighbouring countries in the production of lower-end products \nfor the global market.\n5\n \n \n 4 \nMade in China, coinciding the notion of China as the factory of the world, provides a \nconventional way of thinking that China, especially the People\u201fs Republic of China \n(PRC) is the linchpin of business and economic development. China has drawn the \nglobal attention toward its growth, its economic development and its so-called \npeaceful rise. In other words, everything is under the canopy of China. This is \nparticularly so, especially in terms of military relations. However, as far as economic \nand business activities are concerned, we have to take into consideration more broadly \nthe notion of Chinesenese in trying to understand the whole meaning of the intricate \nof capital, money, business relations, human capital, business network, information \ngathering, etc in formulating the concept of Made by Chinese. \n \nThis view \u201eMade by Chinese\u201f directs us to examine the ways in which factors such as \neconomic capital, market forces, business practices, capital mobility, industrial \nrelations, Chinese diaspora, human capital mobility, foreign direct investment (FDI), \npolitical and business relations, technological transfer are being worked out \ninteractively among Chinese business and regional economic communities in \nconnection with the global economy.\n6\n Such idea, on the one hand, embedded some \nuniqueness behind the notion of Asian capitalism. On the other hand, such idea cannot \nbe able to deviate from regional and general economic consents as Lucian Pye once \n 5 \nreminded us that \u201eIn short, the Confucian tradition had to be coupled with advances in \neconomics as an intellectual discipline in order to produce the economic miracles of \nEast Asia.\u201f7 The notion of Chineseness and its ways of dealing with business \nactivities are therefore under scrutiny by the entire global economy as well as East \nAsian region because these \u201eChinese\u201f elements sometime echo unnecessary human \nscarify (over the sub-standard mining site incidents), intellectual property \ninfringement or simply corruption, if not political business relations.\n8\n \n  \nMade in China refers more to the state as an actor in the international political \neconomy, where countries\u201f options will be limited to some conventional tactics such \nas financial policy, economic negotiation, trade talks, economic treaties and free trade \nagreement in dealing with the rise of China. Made by Chinese is a soul-searching idea \nwhich needs some conceptual thinking and empirical tools of analysis in dealing with \nthe notion of the \u201esoft power\u201f or \u201enetwork power\u201f of the rise of China through \ndifferent economic, business and political power construction process.\n9\n Both notions \ncannot substitute each other. Nor can they be implemented without the consent and \nagreement of the East Asian and global community. One thing, however, rather clear, \nis that the tension between China and Chinese in mapping out the business identities \nwill be a resounding issue in this region.    \n 6 \n \nAlthough not evenly distributed, the five papers included in this section can generally \nbe grouped either toward Made by China and Made by Chinese. More importantly, \nthese papers are complementing one another, and at some points, are debating fiercely \namong themsleves. The first two papers by Pan, and Ravenhill and Chung are trying \nto give rise to some global\/regional concerns in a way to interrogate the orientation of \nthe statist meaning of China\u201fs rise. Chung and Hamilton, Jacobsen and Cheung\u201fs \npapers re-examine the economic, business and political functions of Chineseness in \nhistorical, regional and sub-regional context.    \n \nThe main message of Pan\u201fs paper is that the rise of China is a reluctant coronation \nwhich should be critically assessed in connection with the global capitalist \ndevelopment. His paper juxtaposes international relations theories with a view to \nre-position China\u201fs \u201enormal\u201f economic function under the lenses of global production \nnetwork (GPN). Such empirical tool helps the readers to re-examine China\u201fs rise from \na transnational process, which helps de-construct the notion of Chineseness behind \nChina\u201fs being the \u201efactory of the world\u201f, and re-construct a new phenomenon of \n\u201eworld factories in China.\u201f Another tacit message in the paper demonstrates that the \nstate (government of China) actually gives little help in promoting some very famous \nChinese brands today by the time when they urgently needed financial help at the very \n 7 \ninitial stage of their business establishment. Their success is very much a private \nentrepreneurial attempt. This observation may change or at least allow ones to \nre-examine another conventional model of East Asian development\u2014the \ndevelopmental state model. \n \nRavenhill and Jiang\u201fs paper takes a regional perspective in studying China\u201fs \nincreasing zest for Free Trade Agreement with Asian countries, Australia, New \nZealand, Pakistan, ASEAN and etc. They were puzzled by the very means and the \ncontents of the FTA signed by China and other Asian countries. Although FTA, in \nprinciple, indicates bilateral or multilateral trade relations, the ways in which China \nacts, according to their findings, suggest that there are something different in the \nso-called \u201esoft power\u201f relations, if not regional hegemony, or Chinese mentality in \nhandling business affairs, whether involving state or non-state actors. China\u201fs ways of \ndealing with most of the FTA seem to follow the strategy of scarifying short term gain \nin order to obtain the long term gain. To add on the understanding behind the motives \nof the FTA from other conventional approaches, they further point out that China\u201fs \nbeing a market economy will allow China to gain less in those negotiations of FTA. \nThey identify three cases, China-Hong Kong Economic Partnership Agreement \n(CEPA), China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and Australia-China FTA (AUCFTA) \n 8 \nto substantiate their points that national interests are the basic elements behind these \nFTAs, although there are some differences in contents. The question that we are going \nto ask is that can FTA help accelerate the economic reform that China is aiming at? \n \nChung and Hamilton address a conventional question: the Chinese diasporic \nbusiness with historical cases and substantial historical records. Their paper \nrecognizes the importance of Chinese business elites but refuses to resort to the \ncultural essentialism such as Bamboo networks or guanxi networks only. Instead, they, \nthrough various cases, point out that Chinese business elites are able adapt to Western \norganizational methods to tailor their specific needs. Their study is echoed from Joe \nStudwell\u201fs recent work Asian Godfathers: Money and Power in Hong Kong and \nSoutheast Asia. In his words, Asian business tycoons are able to blend elitism, \nprofessionalism, capitalism and local political structure to an extent that is having no \ndifferent from a cartel, for example the housing industry in Hong Kong\n10\n  \n \nLike many overseas Chinese business observers, they began to look at the \neconomic empire of Robert Kuok (the wealthiest person in Southeast Asia) to trace \nthe illusive networks among his business together with many intricate subsidies \nbeneath his business empire. However, they challenge both institutionalist (gradual \n 9 \ntransformation of Asian business to Western style firm and organization) and political \neconomy (developmental state model). They make their argument through the \nhistorical search of huiguan or gongsuo, the merchant association, especially the \nprivate banking in Shanghai to locate the elements behind Chinese capitalism. Their \nconclusion points to the argument that Chinese businesses are practicing capitalism \nand adopting Western style organization method by retaining some essential Chinese \nbusiness cohesion, family and clanship style.  \n \nJacobsen\u201fs paper also uses Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia as an example. But, he \nhas been trying to situate the Chinese diaspora within the discursive analysis between \nnation-state and citizenship. He critically examines the ethnic and cultural traits of \nChinese business relations by reminding us the importance of the circumstantial \nsocio-political structure of the resident country that conditions their ways of business \nrelations. This paper mirror-images the contesting nature between the state (China) \nand the more intangible notion of sojourner (Chinese). The analytical aspect of this \npaper goes further to understand how well Chinese ethnic relations can be able to \nstand on the wings of globalization to empower their relative importance in relation to \nthe respective resident countries. The case of the Indonesia Chinese diaspora seems to \nsuggest that the tide is gradually turning to the benefit of the Chinese, so far. Yet, the \n 10 \ncounter argument is that the situational changes of the Chinese diaspora can also be \nexplained by the shadow of the rise of the China, which means the state\u201fs image is \nhaving some calling power, from a very long distance of course. \n \nCheung\u201fs paper takes a further sub-regional view to examine the governance of the \nPeople\u201fs Republic of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (the so-called Greater China) to \nevaluate the interactions through economic, social and political changes of Greater \nChina. He, by using a more conceptual approach, demonstrates that Hong Kong and \nTaiwan are effective variables in providing not just economic and human capital to \nconstruct the notion of the rise of China. Such conceptual approach gives rise to \nvarious factors (integration, interdependence, identity and independence) that can \nserve as thought provoking elements in studying the sub-regional meanings of the \nnotion of Chineseness in assessing the politics of the economic meanings of the \neconomic rise of China. \n \nIn conclusion, the key element of these papers is that if we study China\u201fs economic \nrise from the state centric angle, we may put ourselves in a very vulnerable position of \nnot being able to appreciate the whole picture. Alternativeness, if we study from the \nvarious traits or Chinese practices, we will be drawn into cultural essentialism, no \n 11 \nmatter how efficient they are in painting the uniqueness of Chinese ways of business. \n\u201eMade in China\u201f and \u201emade by Chinese are two complementary while contending \nconcepts which cannot be studied individually without referring to their interactive \nfunctions. These papers are therefore presented here, very tentatively, to facilitate \nfuture discussion on these two concepts. \n \n \n 12 \nNOTES: \n                                                 \n1\n Saskia Sassen, Territory, Authority, Rights: From Medieval to Global Assemblages \n(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007): 1. \n \n2\n See Nicholas R.
