The single season decision is supported by a wheat crop and annual weed\ngrowth simulation, with a multi-stage heuristic decision model. The rotational aspect uses a\nmodel of seed population dynamics, with decisions optimised using stochastic dynamic\nprogramming. Each time scale has its own user interface within a single program integrated\ninto the ArableDS framework, which provides data sharing between several decision support\nmodules. Weed Manager was used by about 100 farmers and consultants in the 2005\u20132006\nand 2006\u201320077 seasons.\nKeywords: weeds, decision support, models, optimisation, dynamic programming,\nstochastic, heuristics\n1. Introduction\nWeed control continues to cause major financial problems for arable farmers and, with the\never-increasing threat from herbicide resistance in both grass and broad-leaved weeds, the\nneed to make the correct management decision is even greater. Targeting weed control and\nstrategic planning over a whole crop rotation, through achieving maximum benefits from a\ncombination of cultural and chemical control measures, may help to reduce costs. The need to\nbalance crop production and farmland biodiversity, along with increased environmental\nawareness have become important issues, therefore an understanding of the longer-term\nimplications of weed control strategies is required. In future, herbicide application will\nprobably need to be targeted with more precision to meet EU water quality directives, while\nthe number of available herbicides is reduced. Weeds form an important part of the farmland\necosystem, contributing food and hosts for insects, and providing food and cover for birds, an\nimportant indicator of biodiversity health. The use of weed management operations,\nespecially herbicides, may have an impact on these functions (Marshall et al., 2003).\nSeveral authors have used models of weed populations to investigate the economics of weed\ncontrol (e.g. Cousens et al., 1986, Doyle et al., 1986). A typical approach has attempted to set\nthresholds for intervention (Coble & Mortensen, 1992, Berti et al., 2003, Nesser et al., 2004,\nBennett et al., 2003). This may overlook the importance of rotation and other methods of\ncultural control in weed management. For example, the inclusion of spring crops in the\nrotation allows more autumn-emerging weeds to be controlled by ploughing and other\ncultivations, while crops other than cereals provide a wider choice of herbicides for grass-\n2weed control. An alternative approach, based on multi-season models of population\ndynamics, is the use of dynamic programming to optimise a weed control policy (Fisher &\nLee, 1981; Sells, 1995). Most of these models have been research tools intended to provide\ninformation for use by extension services. More recently there has been growing interest in\nthe use of computer-based decision support systems (DSS) to make these tools directly\naccessible by farmers and their advisers.\nProbably the most successful in terms of the proportion of the industry using it, due to\nregulatory requirements, is the Danish PC Plant Protection system (Murali et al., 1999),\nwhich has sold over 2500 licences. It covers control of weeds, pests and diseases in wheat\nand other crops, including barley, peas and oilseed rape with an emphasis on reducing\nchemical use. Models are used to assess the need for control based on observations, then it\ngives recommendations of product choice and dose. Other approaches include the use of\nBayesian networks in a DSS designed for growing malting barley without pesticides\n(Kristensen & Rasmussen, 2002).\nIn the UK, the Arable Decision Support (ArableDS) initiative was intended to provide a\nrange of computer-based decision support tools for farmers and advisers. It is the result of a\nseries of research and development projects starting in the mid 1990s, and now aims to\ninclude a wider community of users and developers (Parsons, et al., 2004). Weed Manager is\na DSS module designed as part of the ArableDS suite running on Microsoft Windows\u2122.\nWeed Manager provides farmers, agronomists and distributors with a robust tool to plan and\ndevelop weed management strategies. In order to ensure that Weed Manager met the needs of\nthe industry, it was developed with the involvement of users (farmers, agronomists and\ndistributors) at all stages of the project, from the initial design to testing the decision making\nprocesses.\nThe system consists of a within season planning tool to investigate a range of weed\nmanagement strategies in a winter wheat crop in a single season, and a rotational planning\ntool allowing users to consider weed control options over several years. A survey of French\nfarmers also found that they considered different time-scales for decision making: current\nyear, rotation and long term (Mac\u00e9 et al., 2007).\nBoth parts of the system are model based, using data specific to individual farms. There are a\ncomprehensive herbicide database and an encyclopaedia within the system, containing\ninformation on approximately 150 herbicides used in winter wheat. The weeds encyclopaedia\ncontains detailed information on the biology, life cycle, geographic location, identification\nand control measures for over 140 key arable weed species, along with photographs of all the\nkey growth stages from cotyledon through to flowering. Additional information on\nenvironmental impacts, herbicide resistance, biodiversity and cultural control measures are all\nincluded (Tatnell et al., 2006). The environmental information includes the statutory\nenvironmental protection information and copies of Environmental Impact Sheets listing the\nrisk to six classes of organisms plus soil water and groundwater, produced under the\nVoluntary Initiative, a programme agreed between the agrochemical industry and the UK\ngovernment. Weed Manager contains a full help system to guide the user when required.\nThis paper gives an overview of the design of Weed Manager, the user interface and the\nunderlying models. The models are described in more detail by Benjamin et al. (in press) and\nTatnell et al. (2006). Additional information is available from www.weedmanager.co.uk.\n32. System architecture\nWeed Manager, in common with several other ArableDS tools, operates as a module within\nthe ArableDS Data Sharing Environment (DSE) and uses the same basic agronomic,\npesticide, weather and user data. These programs have common user interface elements to\nhelp users to learn how to use the system (Parsons et al., 2004).\nThe outline structure of the system is shown in Fig. 1. All the data are stored in Microsoft\nAccess\u2122 databases that are accessed via dynamic link libraries (DLLs). The encyclopaedia is\ndisplayed in the Rothamsted browser (Tatnell et al., 2006), which uses the Microsoft Web\nBrowser component to display the encyclopaedia pages. The decision support module has\nbeen developed in Microsoft Visual C++\u2122 V6.0 using object oriented, component based\nsoftware development methods to ensure that the system can be extended to encompass more\nfunctionality as required and could be developed on multiple sites. Each component is\ndescribed in more detail below.\nDecision support module\nPesticide\ndata\nAgronomic\ndata\nUser\nweed\ndata\nHerbicide\nand weed\nbiology data\nWrapper handles data\nBiological\nmodel\nDecision\nmodel\nData\nSharing\nEnvironment\nWeed\nManager\nWeed\nEncyclopaedia\nResistance\nrisk model\nWeather\ndata\nFarm\nData\nSpray nozzle\nselector\nOCX provides user interface and controls models\nKey\nGeneric data\nSoftware component\nSite-specific data\nFig.1. System architecture of Weed Manager and links to the Data Sharing\nEnvironment\n2.1 The wrapper\nThe wrapper component is an Object Linking and Embedding (OLE\u2122) in-place and\nautomation server, which was generated using the Microsoft Application Wizard and so uses\nthe document\/view architecture of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC\u2122). The\ndocument class provides all the data handling and manages retrieval of the user\u2019s data from\nthe DSE. The farm and weather data are supplied in intermediate databases that are accessed\n4using DLLs as described below. Weed Manager can read and update the farm database, but\ncan only read from the weather database. Changes to the cropping information, farm costs\nand observations are stored immediately. The treatment programmes, consisting of\ncultivations and sprays are stored only when requested by the user to allow them to test\ndifferent scenarios without affecting the underlying data. When the user switches to a\ndifferent module in the DSE or closes Weed Manager, it offers the option to save modified\nplans.\n2.2. The OCX\nMost of the handling of the user interface and the models in Weed Manager is implemented\nin an ActiveX\u2122 control (OCX), which is a separately compiled module. The use of an OCX\nto implement the user interface and model interactions gives several benefits. Firstly, it\nseparates database handling from user interaction. Secondly, it allows the inclusion of the\nsystem within a different wrapper program. Finally, it solves some technical difficulties that\noccur when using multiple views in an in-place server. Taken together these considerably\nsimplified development.\nThe user interface contains two views (see Fig. 2 & 3), one for assistance with within season\ncontrol of weeds in winter wheat and one for control of weeds in a rotation of up to 6 years.\nThe user interface is discussed in more detail in Section 3.\nFig. 2.

The data below the\nline are part of Weed Manager.\nThe pesticide data provided by the DSE consist of the statutory information relating to the\nherbicides that can be used in winter wheat, including restrictions on maximum doses and\ntiming of applications, with additional information on permitted and prohibited tank mixes.\nThis information is imported from the LIAISON database (www.liaison.csl.gov.uk)\ndeveloped by the Central Science Laboratory based on data supplied by the UK Pesticide\nSafety Directorate (Thomas et al., 2000). The information regarding the dose and timing of\napplications is converted from text into mathematical terms for use by the decision support\nprocess models. In addition, the pesticide database contains default values for the cost of each\npesticide and some statutory label data relating to the application of the product. The data can\nbe viewed by users through the encyclopaedia.\nThe agronomic database provides default values for drilling and harvest dates, crop value,\nbasic costs for operations such as ploughing and spraying as well as values for the variable\ncosts associated with each crop. This ensures that the same defaults are available for each\nDSS within the ArableDS framework.\nIn order to predict the plant growth over the complete season, the system uses weather data\nfrom the DSE. It combines the weather data for the current season (referred to as user\nweather) with climate data for the most appropriate of 26 regions in the UK to provide\nweather data for the full season. The user weather data are specific to each site and can be\n6entered manually, transferred from a data logger or downloaded from the ArableDS web site,\nwith over 100 possible weather sites being available. Users can also add their forecast data.\nThe climate data sets are intended to provide representative data for the models when\nforecasting future outcomes and were designed in consultation with the developers of several\ndecision support modules. Each set contains 12-year means of the daily temperature, solar\nradiation, wind and transpiration data. Because rainfall is a sporadic event, and the\nmagnitude of the event is important for some applications, such as forecasting splash-borne\ndiseases and runoff, daily means are not appropriate, The method used is designed to ensure\nthat statistics including the 5-day total (or mean) and the numbers of dry and high rainfall\ndays are maintained. The year is divided into 5-day intervals and the 12-year means of the\ntotal rainfall and the numbers of dry days and days with more than 5 mm rain in each period\nare calculated. The climate data set is then constructed to ensure that these properties are\npreserved. In the case of Weed Manager, the important statistic is the 5-day total rainfall,\nwhich is used to calculate the soil moisture, on which seed germination depends.\nThe farm-specific data consist of farm location, field and cropping information, including\nobservations of plant growth and treatment plans. The database also stores the herbicide\napplication, cultivation, herbicide and variable crop costs entered by the user, which override\nthe default values in the agronomic database. The farm data provided to the decision models\ntherefore uses a combination of the user\u2019s own information and that supplied by the DSE.\nIn addition to the shared data provided by the DSE, Weed Manager requires its own weed\nand herbicide information to: populate the encyclopaedia, provide parameters for the models\npredicting crop and weed growth, and to estimate the costs of controlling each modelled\nweed in each crop. The key parameters are discussed within the descriptions of the models.\n3. User interface\nThe within season and rotational management decisions are represented by two separate\nviews, each filling the main window (Fig. 2 & 3). The user can rapidly switch between them\nby clicking on a button on the toolbar. The rotational screen reflects the cultivation choices\nthe user has made in the within season view, so always shows winter wheat and the current\nweeds and cultivation decisions. Each view is linked to a biological model and a decision\nmodel, which are described in Section 4.\n3.1. The within season view\nThe first time Weed Manager is used on a new farm a weed list has to be created. The weed\nlist editor opens automatically (Fig. 4) and the user can choose the weeds of interest and\nestimates of their expected density in the crop in terms of four density classes, and save these\nas a weed list. The user can create new lists or edit existing ones at any time.\nSubsequently, Weed Manager opens in the within season view (Fig. 2), which can be used at\nany time from just after harvest of the previous season\u2019s crop to just before harvest of the\ncurrent season\u2019s crop. The screen layout shares many features with other ArableDS programs.\nBelow the usual menu and toolbars, there is an information bar showing basic details of the\nfield crop and key dates. Each date, including the \u2018current date\u2019 on which planning is based,\ncan be changed by clicking the control to its right.\n7Fig. 4. The Weed Manager weed list editor. The panel on the left shows the weeds\navailable in the model; the buttons in the centre show the population density classes,\nwhich are weed-specific; and the panel on the right contains the currently selected\nweeds at the densities estimated by the user.\nThe main area of the screen shows a pictorial representation of the development of the weeds\nand the crop as calculated by the biological model. There is a horizontal panel for each weed\nshowing the progression of growth stages calculated by the model. This is linked to the date\nbar (or time line) that runs across the screen, just above the panel showing the crop growth\nstages. Above the timeline is another bar with a set of icons representing cultivation and\nspraying operations performed on the crop. Each icon is linked to a double-headed arrow on\nthe date bar, which may be dragged sideways to adjust the operation date. The whole display\ncan be scrolled sideways using the arrow buttons at the ends of the date bar, or zoomed in and\nout to show a different range of dates.\nAdditional information on each weed is provided down the left of the screen. Up to three\nicons can be displayed to indicate features such as sensitivity to frost, or importance for\nwildlife. To the right of the growth stage panel for each weed, two vertical bars display the\nkill rate calculated by the model for the current cultivation and herbicide sequence (adjacent\nto the growth stage pane) and the yield loss resulting from the weed population (to the right\nof the kill rate bar). On the extreme right of the screen another vertical bar shows the\npredicted yield or margin over herbicide and cultivation costs for the proposed treatment\nstrategy and the degree of uncertainty in the estimate. This uncertainty is calculated by\nrunning the model using the minima and maxima of the weed density classes selected by the\nuser. Variable costs other than herbicides and cultivations are not included in the margin\ncalculation, because they are not affected by the decisions being considered.\nIn addition to dragging the arrows to change the times of operations, the user can edit the\ncultivation plan and the spray plan by clicking on toolbar buttons or selecting the\ncorresponding commands from the menu. These present similar dialogs showing the current\nplan and the available cultivations or herbicides (Fig. 5). Operations can be added on any date\nor removed from the plan. Herbicides are chosen by product name and the required dose can\nalso be chosen from the ones available for the product. To reduce the need to select from a\n8long list of all the available herbicides, the chemical list editor is used to create a short list of\nproducts appropriate to the user that will be displayed when choosing treatments and used in\nthe decision model.\nFig 5. The Weed Manager spray plan editor. The panel on the left shows the available\nherbicides, with application restrictions for the selected product below, the middle panel\ncontains buttons for the available doses; and the panel on the right shows the current\nspray and cultivation plan.\nThe settings dialog can be used to change the crop-dependent information, such as the\nexpected yield, density, variable costs and grain price. As the season progresses, it is also\npossible to add observations of the crop and weeds, giving the growth stage and the density\nobserved on a particular date. These are used to revise the predictions of the model,\nincreasing the accuracy.\nThese features make it very easy to experiment with different cultivation sequences and\nherbicides to see their effect on the weeds, the crop yield and the margin. However, the range\nof options is huge, and it may be difficult to find the best combination. To help with this, the\nsystem includes a suggest treatments feature. To ensure a reasonable response time, the user\nmust first select a chemical list of 50 products or fewer. The program will then search\nthrough thousands of combinations of cultivations and herbicide programmes to produce a\nlist of those that give good margins. This is described further in Section 4.3. Having obtained\na list of programmes, one can then be selected for more detailed examination in the main\nview.\n3.2. The rotational view\nThe rotational view (Fig. 3) allows the consequences of weed control decisions to be\nexamined over 6 years. The information area below the tool bar and the display of yield and\nmargin on the right hand side, are similar to the within season view. However the rest of the\nscreen is rather different from that view and most of the other ArableDS programs, which\nfocus on single-season decisions.\n9Most of the screen is occupied by a grid in which the columns represent growing seasons.\nThe upper part of the screen has rows showing the crop, type of cultivation (plough or non-\ninversion), sowing date (early, mid or late), and herbicide costs (divided into four classes).\nThe crop and cultivation for the first year are fixed by the within season decisions; any of the\nother pieces of information can be changed directly by clicking on the grid cell and selecting\nfrom a pop-up list. The results of changes are recalculated immediately and redisplayed.\nThe lower part of the screen shows the results of the model. The biological model, which is\ndescribed in section 4.2, simulates the population of weed seeds for each species in the\nshallow and deep soil layers, although only the shallow layer is displayed. The changing\npopulations are shown both as words and colour codes, ranging from white (very low),\nthrough shades of yellow to red (very high). These give instant feedback of the state of the\nseedbank. The top row of this section of the screen shows the average gross margin\ncalculated by the model for each year. It provides a vivid and highly interactive illustration of\nthe way that decisions taken in one season can have consequences for many years to come.\nAs with the within season view, this screen can be used interactively, or optimised by\nchoosing the suggest treatments command once the rotation has been fixed. In this case the\nuser can choose how many years, up to 5, to include in the rotation. The decision model\n(section 4.4) finds the optimum strategy for the whole rotation consisting of cultivation type,\nsowing date (early, mid or late) and herbicide cost, and presents it on the screen.\n4. Models\n4.1. The models of weed and crop development within a season\nTo provide the information for the within season view, Weed Manager contains models of the\ngrowth of wheat and weed species, and the effect of the weeds on the wheat yield. A\npreviously established growth stage model of Milne et al. (2003), which was used in the\nArableDS Wheat Disease Manager project (Parsons et al., 2004), was extended to include\nmore detail of the early growth stages. In the model, leaf, tiller, node and ear development in\nwheat are associated with the temperature and day-length. Using the same model, parameter\nsets relating development to the input variables were developed for the grass-weed species\nbeing considered. A similar approach was taken for broad-leaved weeds except that the\nnumber of stages calculated was smaller. The species-dependent parameters (about 40 in\ntotal) are held in the weed biology and herbicides database.\nThe model does not attempt to predict yield, because it depends on factors other than weed\nmanagement; instead the user is asked to enter the expected yield in the absence of weeds.\nThe model predicts yield-induced weed loss based on the assumption that that the yield loss\ndue to a population of weeds depends on the relative green area indices of crop and weeds at\na given point in the canopy development, according to the model of Kropff et al. (1995) with\na separate competition parameter for each species. The point used is when the total green area\nindex (GAI) of crops and weeds is 0.75, and this is referred to as canopy closure. The models\nsimulate the development of the crop and multiple weed species, in particular the growth of\ntheir leaf areas, from germination to canopy closure. The growth of each species in the\ncommunity is simulated using an ecophysiological model (Kropff & van Laar, 1993). The\ncrop is simulated as a single cohort of plants germinating simultaneously, whereas each weed\nspecies is simulated as eight cohorts to account for the distribution of germination dates that\nwill occur. The first to emerge is displayed on the user interface. The timing of the emergence\n10\nof these cohorts is based on a polynomial model for each weed fitted to the pattern of\nseasonal emergence summarised by Evans (1962).\nThe sowing density for the crop is specified by the user, allowing the total canopy size to be\ncalculated. Again, this affects only the yield loss estimate: the expected yield is set by the\nuser. The weed seed population is unknown, so instead the user specifies the plant density\nemerged or expected to emerge. As precise estimation of density is difficult, it is entered as\none of four classes (low, medium, medium\/high, high) described by a density range, as shown\nin Fig. 4. The model can be corrected during the season by further observations of density,\nground cover or growth stage of the crop or weeds. The model simulates germination,\nemergence, development and growth, driven by daily weather data (temperature and rainfall).\nThe effect of herbicides is simulated by reducing the weed GAI according to the sensitivity of\neach weed to the herbicide, based on data provided by the manufacturers. Each weed is\nclassed as eliminated by (G), susceptible (S), moderately susceptible (MS), moderately\nresistant (MR) or resistant (R) to each herbicide at each of its growth stages.\nCultivation operations act in several ways. Those that are used after drilling, such as tine\nweeding, are treated in the same way as herbicides. Non-inversion operations before drilling,\nsuch as harrowing, kill the emerged seedlings, but have no effect on the ungerminated seeds.\nPloughing inverts the soil to a depth of about 250 mm, and in doing so kills the emerged\nseedlings, but brings to the surface a new population of seeds. It thus stimulates further\ngermination and emergence.\nThe model has been fully parameterised for 12 weed species: Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.\n(black-grass), Anisantha sterilis (L.) Neviski (barren brome), Avena fatua L. (wild oats),\nLolium multiflorum Lam. (Italian ryegrass), Poa annua L. (annual meadow-grass), Stellaria\nmedia (L.) Vill. (common chickweed), Galium aparine L. (cleavers), Papaver rhoeas L.\n(common poppy), Chenopodium album L. (fat hen), Polygonum aviculare L. (knotgrass),\nvolunteer Vicia faba L. (field beans) and volunteer Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera (oilseed\nrape). Where relevant, parameters are also included for herbicide resistant biotypes. The\nmodel is described in more detail by Tatnell et al. (2006).\n4.2. The model of weed dynamics in a crop rotation\nThe biological model of weed dynamics was designed to provide the quantitative information\nfor the rotational view in the Weed Manager program and to be used by the corresponding\ndecision model. A detailed description can be found in Benjamin et al. (in press) and Tatnell\net al. (2006).\nThe model is based on the life cycle model developed by Moss (1990) for A. myosuroides,\nbut can be applied to many annual plant species. In essence, it is based on estimation of seed\nfecundity and survival. Similar models have been proposed by Doyle et al. (1986) and\nCousens et al. (1986) to describe the life cycle of A. myosuroides and A. fatua (wild oats),\nrespectively. Because of the large uncertainties present in the weed life cycle, it is necessary\nto describe the population changes by probability distributions, potentially leading to a\nstochastic model. However, if probabilities were used for every step the model would be\nunnecessarily complicated. In the present model, the population is described by a distribution,\nbut the operations performed on it are deterministic.\n11\nThe state variables in the model are the seedbanks (seeds\/m2) immediately after harvest in\ntwo layers: the shallow layer, 0\u201350 mm, and the deep layer, 50\u2013250 mm. Unless disturbed by\ncultivations, seeds in the shallow layer could potentially germinate during the autumn,\nwhereas those in the deep layer must be brought up to the shallow layer in order to germinate.\nA series of processes determines the seedbank in the following year. Cultivations cause an\nexchange of seeds between the two soil layers. Ploughing moves almost all of the seeds from\nthe shallow layer to the deep one and brings up a substantial proportion of seeds from the\ndeep layer. Non-inversion cultivations cause a much lower proportion of the seeds to be\nexchanged between the shallower and deeper levels. A proportion of the seeds in the shallow\nlayer germinate to produce seedlings, depending on the time of year and the periodicity of\nemergence of the species. Some of these are killed by cultivations or herbicides, the\nremainder develop into mature plants. The yield loss is estimated from the mature weed\ndensity using the same method as the within season model. The mature plants produce seeds,\nof which some are non-viable and some are lost to herbivory. The remaining viable seeds are\nadded to the shallow layer. At the same time, a proportion of the ungerminated seeds in the\nsoil seedbank die during the year. The model is intended to simulate expected behaviour, with\nseasonal variability included as part of the uncertainty, so the processes described above do\nnot depend on weather data.\nThe model has 11 species-dependent parameters describing seed or plant survival in each\nstep, emergence timing (common to rotational and within season models) and seed\nproduction. These are stored in the weed biology and herbicides database. The parameters\ndescribing the effect of cultivations on the transfer of seeds between the soil layers are\nindependent of the species.\nThe herbicide component of weed management strategies is not described by a detailed list of\nherbicides, but by the herbicide cost level, with four cost bands depending on the crop. The\nkill rate of each combination of crop x weed x cost is stored in the weed biology and\nherbicides database, filled according to peer-reviewed expert knowledge.\nTo enable the weed control programme to be optimised by the decision model, the seedbank\nvariables are divided into discrete ranges. These are related to the classes used to set the\ninitial weed density for the within season model, but the full range is divided into six classes\ninstead of four to give greater resolution, using a method described by Benjamin et al. (in\npress). When the full series of transitions is applied to a single seedbank class to estimate the\nseedbank in the following year, the resulting values form an interval that usually spreads over\nmore than one class. Instead of selecting one class as the resulting state, this result is treated\nas an element of the uncertainty observed in practice, and converted to a distribution by\nassuming that the probability of arriving in a class is the proportion of the interval that\nintersects the class.\n4.3. The decision model for management of weeds within a season\nThe within season decision model is used when the user selects the suggest treatments\ncommand from the within season view in Weed Manager. The objective is to suggest a range\nof different herbicide and cultivation plans that result in good margins for the current season.\nThe margin used is the value of the grain less the herbicide and cultivation costs, all of which\nmay be changed by the user. Because the problem consists of numerous discrete decision\nvariables (for example each herbicide x dose x timing x weed combination has a discrete\n12\nefficacy), it was not possible to develop an efficient optimisation algorithm. To achieve the\ndesired response time of less than 1min on a typical office PC, a heuristic was used to provide\ngood, but possibly not optimal, solutions. The decision model is described in more detail in\nTatnell et al. (2006).\nThe biological model has three main aspects that are relevant to the decision model: the\ntiming of emergence of the crop and cohorts of weeds; the growth of the crop and untreated\nweeds to canopy closure; and the impact of treatments on the GAIs at the time of canopy\nclosure. This separation of the effects of pre-drilling cultivations, which affect emergence,\nand herbicides, including post-drilling cultivations, is important for the decision model,\nbecause the effects of herbicides on yield can be evaluated very quickly, whereas any\noperation that changes the timing of canopy closure requires a full run of the model. The\ndecision model generates and compares feasible treatment programmes, operating in a series\nof phases to reduce the time taken to reach a set of solutions.\nThe first phase only takes place if the decision is being made before drilling. It generates\nthree types of sequences of feasible cultivations: sequences including ploughing, using non-\ninversion cultivation only and direct drilling only. These are evaluated to find the one in each\ntype that gives the highest margin. Some types of sequence may be excluded if the timing of\nthe decision restricts the number operations that can be carried out before drilling.\nHaving chosen up to three cultivation sequences, the second phase filters the working list of\nherbicides chosen by the user, to select those appropriate to the weeds present. Some\nherbicides can be applied at different doses, but there are several rules that restrict when they\ncan be applied, when they will be most effective and which mixtures can be used. The\ndecision model defines four consecutive spraying periods: pre-emergence, autumn, spring\nand desiccant. Within each of these, application dates are selected at intervals of 14 days.\nEach herbicide is checked against the rules at each of these application dates; those that pass\nare then considered in the next phase. The post-drilling cultivations are added to the list for\nappropriate periods.\nIn the third phase, the effect of each herbicide is evaluated at each of the timings within each\nspray period to find which timing in each period gives the lowest yield loss. All permitted\nmixtures of two products are evaluated in the same way. Any product or mixture that is not\nsuperior to a cheaper one is eliminated. The result is a list for each period containing\napplicable herbicides and mixtures with their best timings.\nThe fourth phase uses the results of the third to evaluate all the permitted programmes\ncontaining combinations of the remaining herbicides and timings. This results in a list of\nprogrammes, ranked by the resulting margin or, if preferred, yield.\nIn the final phase, the list of programmes is filtered to remove poor solutions and repetitions\nof very similar programmes, because the users preferred to see fewer, more diverse\nsuggestions. All solutions giving a margin less than 90% of the best are removed and, if\nnecessary, similar solutions are progressively removed until fewer than 20 remain.\n4.4. The decision model for management of weeds in a rotation\nThe rotational decision model is used when the user chooses the suggest treatments command\nfrom the rotation view. Using the biological model of seedbank dynamics, it optimises the\n13\nchoice of sowing date, type of cultivation and herbicide cost to find the best strategy\nthroughout a rotation of up to 6 years defined by the user. Full details are given in Benjamin\net al. (in press) and Tatnell et al. (2006).\nThe optimisation is a finite horizon, stochastic dynamic programme, solved by backward\nrecursion solution iteration (Howard, 1960). The solution is the policy that maximises the\nlong term expected discounted return. A policy defines the decision to take for every possible\nstate of the system. The dynamic programme maximises the expected discounted return over\na period of 2\u20134 rotations (8\u201310 years) depending on the length of the rotation.\nAs described above, the biological model is a simulation of seedbank dynamics using two\nsoil layers with six seedbank density classes in each. The state variable for a single weed is\nthen a pair of integers (i, j), each having six possible values, the class numbers, representing\nthe number of seeds in each layer following the harvest of the previous crop. The decision\nvariables are the sowing date (early, mid or late), the type of cultivation (plough or non-\ninversion) and the herbicide cost (in one of four cost bands). The choice of crop is not a\ndecision variable: the user must choose the rotation before attempting to optimise the other\ndecisions. The model takes the state and the decision, and predicts the probability distribution\nof states at the end of the year, that is, the seedbank following the next harvest, and of the\nyield loss, and hence cost, for the season.\nThe return from a single year is the gross margin for the crop. This is calculated from the\nbase yield, the yield loss due to weeds, the crop price, a cost for the type of cultivation, the\nherbicide cost and a crop-dependent sum for the other variable costs. The expected return for\na single year is the sum of the returns for all the possible states, weighted by their\nprobabilities. The expected return over the period of the optimisation is the mean of the\nreturns for the years, weighted by a discount factor to account for interest and inflation, and a\nterminal return for the state in the final year. The terminal return is required in a finite\nhorizon dynamic programme, because the final state will have an effect on future years.\nWithout it the cost of leaving a high final seedbank would be underestimated. The value used\nis the single-year return that would result if the system was maintained in steady-state,\nweighted by the discount factor (Sells, 1995).\nAfter optimisation the display shows the result obtained by taking the most probable seed\npopulation and the corresponding decision each year.\nThe solution time places a limit on the number of weeds that can be optimised\nsimultaneously. Each weed has 36 possible states (6 for each layer), so the solution time\nincreases by a factor of 362 (1296) for each weed added. This was illustrated by a test on a\n2.4 GHz Pentium 4 PC, in which the solution for two weeds required about 15 s, and for three\nweeds required 15540 s (over 4 hours). As a result, Weed Manager simply considers the two\nmost competitive weeds in the optimisation.\n5. User consultation and testing\n5.1. User consultation\nA series of user activities took place between December 2000 and October 2004. In the early\ndevelopment phase of the project the users were consulted and provided feedback on the\n14\nscreen design and content of the system, through a number of workshops at various locations\nin England and Scotland. A number of key points were highlighted from these early\nconsultations that focused the development. These included:\n1. Easy data entry and links to other systems.\n2. Understanding and confidence in system assumptions.\n3. Optimise and compare future strategies.\n4. Manage herbicide resistance in tactical and strategic decisions.\nA group of users was established and consulted during the project. Despite problems at the\nearly stages with recruiting and maintaining numbers (Parker et al., 2004) useful feedback\nwas received at several stages in the project. Additional user involvement included a postal\nsurvey, email consultations and detailed telephone interviews.\nBetween March and October 2004 detailed phone based interviews were carried out with\nusers who had agreed to trial Weed Manager during the 2003\/2004 season. The system was\ndistributed to 50 users, but the final number interviewed was only 18 (7 farmers, 9\nconsultants and 2 lecturers). However, the participants gave feedback on a range of questions\nrelating to the overall helpfulness and usefulness of the system. They highlighted many\nspecific issues relating to the appearance of the user interface, decisions and the weed and\nherbicide encyclopaedias, and gave suggestions for improvements. Of the people\ninterviewed, 13 said they would be likely or very likely to use Weed Manager in the future.\nThe reasons behind this included how useful it would be in: supporting complex decision\nmaking, planning control strategies, teaching, and dealing with unfamiliar problems that may\narise. Most of the users said that the rotational aspect (8\/18) or the encyclopaedia (7\/18) was\nthe most useful, and many commented that the within season screen was complex. However,\nwhen asked which view they would prefer to start with, there was no significant difference:\nnine preferred within season and eight preferred rotational. The most common negative\ncomments were a lack of confidence or trust in the output from the system (9\/18), the time\nneeded to learn and use the system (5\/18), the lack of integration with existing crop data\nmanagement systems (5\/18), or the perception that the agronomist does the same job (4\/18).\nDuring the 2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007 seasons, Weed Manager was used by about 100\nfarmers and advisers. They were asked to provide feedback on the program, and positive\ncomments were received on its ease of use. The users varied in the parts that they used most:\nrotational, within season or the encyclopaedia.\n5.2. Model testing\nThe models were tested against published data during development and against limited trials\nconducted within the project. These are described in Benjamin et al. (in press) and Tatnell et\nal. (2006). Experiments were conducted over two seasons at three sites for three weeds\n(black-grass, cleavers and chickweed), although not every weed was present at every site.\nThese were used to test the prediction of emergence, growth stage and yield loss by the\nwithin season model. The predictions of emergence and development were found to be good.\nIn the first season a very dry autumn resulted in low weed populations with negligible yield\nloss. In the second season, which included herbicide treatments, the predicted yield losses\nwith uncontrolled or partially controlled black-grass were lower than observed by about half,\nleading to a recommendation to recalibrate the competitiveness parameter for this weed. The\nobserved density of cleavers was very high, but the resulting yield loss was low, although this\n15\nweed is normally highly competitive. A panel of farmers, agronomists and scientists assessed\nthat the predictions of the model were closer to the yield loss that would have been expected\nfrom previous trials and field experience. Taking these adjustments into account, the model\nwas able to predict the response to autumn and early spring herbicides, but failed to deal with\nlate spring herbicides, which were beyond the scope of its design.\nThe rotational model, could not be tested against new trials within the duration of the project,\nso it was compared with published data, such as Munier-Jolain et al. (2002) for black-grass,\nKnab & Hurle (1986) and Zwerger & Hurle (1990) for chickweed. In general, the model\nparameters used resulted in slightly lower control of the weed populations than those\nobserved, leading towards risk-averse management strategies, but the pattern of response to\ndifferent cultivation options was correct.\nThe available data were not sufficient to test all the species and treatments, so further\nevaluation of both models was conducted by a panel of experts from within the project. This\nincluded members from the south of England and Scotland, providing experience over a\nrange of climatic conditions.\nThe more formal parts of this testing consisted of defining a set of scenarios and asking the\npanel for the results they would expect. These were then compared with the results obtained\nby running the models. For the within season model this was applied to the large scale\nbehaviour, such as the impact on final yield of an initial weed population, and to specific\ndetails, such as the expected emergence date of weed species given specific cultivation\nsequences. For the rotational model, testing concentrated on the dynamics of each species in\nresponse to consistent management options. Less formal testing also allowed the experts to\nrun through a larger series of scenarios with the model to identify any anomalous results.\nAt the end of this process it was agreed that, although the absolute precision of the models in\ncomparison with experimental data was not high, the relative responses to treatments were\nadequate to allow the formation of suitable weed management strategies. However, there is a\nneed for further calibration of the predictions, especially in the context of the questions of\ntrust raised by the user interviews.\n6. Examples\n6.1. Weed control within a season\nTo illustrate the within season models, an example was constructed consisting of winter\nwheat drilled on 1 October 2006 following harvest of the previous crop on 14 August 2006.\nThe weeds were barren brome at 4\u201312 plants\/m2 (low-medium), cleavers at 3\u20138 plants\/m2\n(low-medium) and herbicide resistant black-grass at 101\u2013250 plants\/m2 (medium-high). The\nresults are shown in Table 1, where the 16 herbicides provided on the working list are\ndesignated by letters A\u2013P. Starting with an inversion tillage plan (mouldboard plough and\nharrow), which gave a mean margin of \u00a3375, the herbicide programme was optimised,\nresulting in a 2-spray programme with a mean margin of \u00a3482\/ha. Variations were considered\nby retaining each of the sprays from the optimum programme individually, both of which\nreduced the margin considerably. Finally another optimisation was performed, in which the\ncultivations were included. This resulted in the same herbicide programme, but inversion\ntillage was replaced by direct drilling, giving a margin of \u00a3519\/ha. Although the yield was\nslightly lower, the reduced cultivation cost compensated for this.\n16\nTable 1. In season model with barren brome, cleavers and black-grass.

Weed control over a rotation\nTables 2\u20135 illustrate the results of the rotation model. A base case was set up as shown in\nTable 2, using a rotation of 2 years winter wheat, winter oilseed rape, 2 years winter wheat,\nwinter beans, and with a mixture of cultivations, moderate herbicide costs and mid sowing\ndates. The weeds considered were black-grass with herbicide resistance and barren brome.\nThe initial plant densities were set to give moderate seedbanks. Note that the first column of\nthe table shows the results at the end of the first season, when the seedbanks had increased.\nThe range in margin due to the variability in the weed population (see section 4.3) was \u00a30\u2013\n303\/ha with a mean of \u00a3152\/ha, and the weed seedbank was higher at the end than the start.\nTable 3 shows the results of optimising this system. The sowing date was changed to late in\nevery year, non-inversion tillage was replaced by ploughing, and the herbicide cost on the\nwheat, but not the break crops, was increased. The expected margin was \u00a3246\/ha, with much\nless variability. The barren brome seedbank was well controlled, and the black-grass fairly\nwell. Note that the optimisation begins in the second season; the first is unchanged because it\nrepresents the current season in which most of the decisions have already been taken. Late\nsowing was recommended throughout the optimised plan, to reduce the amount of black-\ngrass emerging in the crop, but it would be problematic for the farmer to adopt such a\nstrategy across the whole farm, because inclement weather could prevent late sowing.\nHowever, it does highlight that fields with this particular weed problem should be sown last\nwhen planning the timing of autumn sowing of winter wheat.\nTable 4 shows a slightly revised base case in which the break crop in year 3 was changed\nfrom winter to spring oilseed rape. This gave good control of the barren brome population in\nthat year, and improved the control of black-grass, but the black-grass population recovered\nrapidly due to seed rain and seeds ploughed from the deep layer. The expected margin was\n\u00a3158\/ha, slightly better than without the spring crop, because the margins following the break\ncrop had improved. Table 5 shows the result of optimising this system. The changes were\nsimilar to those in the original base case, except for the change to non-inversion cultivation\nfor the break crop and the following year. The expected margin over the rotation was\n17\n\u00a3241\/ha, which was slightly less than when using winter oilseed rape in year 3. Looking at\nthe individual years, the margins of all the crops following the break had increased, but the\nmargin for the break crop itself was lower than for the winter break crop, because the\nmaximum weed-free yield was lower. The most significant difference was the improvement\nin the control of the black-grass population.\nAs noted in section 5.2, the management of the black-grass population was generally slightly\nmore cautious than would be required on the basis of Munier-Jolain et al. (2002). The use of\nploughing to control barren brome is well-established (Peters et al., 1993; Smith et al. 1999),\nas is the effectiveness of a spring crop.\nTable 2.

Conclusions and future directions\nWeed manager has been developed, tested and shown to have the potential to assist weed\nmanagement decision in winter wheat and arable rotations. However, quantitative testing of\nthe models, particularly for some of the less studied weeds, has been limited by the\navailability of data, so further validation and calibration of the models, and further testing of\nthe decisions in practice is still needed.\nWeed Manager could be expanded in several directions in future. First, the number of weed\nspecies needs to be increased by creating suitable parameter sets. Second, extending the crop\nmodel to other cereals and developing models for other types of crops, such as oilseed rape\nand legumes, would lead to its use in more arable cropping situations. Third, the outputs and\noptimisation options could be extended to include biodiversity decisions and other\nenvironmental impacts. Beneficial weeds are already identified by the environmental icons,\nso maintaining them within a crop or headland could be an objective. The choice of\n19\nherbicides may be restricted in specific environmental sensitive catchments because of the\npotential for certain chemicals to exceed Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), and Weed\nManager could be used to propose strategies for weed control with a reduced risk of\nenvironmental harm.\n8.
