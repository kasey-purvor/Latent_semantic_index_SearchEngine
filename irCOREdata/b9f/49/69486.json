Introduction \nThe separation of U from Np and Pu are major stages in the reprocessing of spent \nnuclear fuel by the Purex process [1,2]. Separation is commonly achieved by oxidation \nstate-specific aqueous \/ non-aqueous solvent extraction processes, controlled by redox \nmanipulation of key Pu or Np oxidation states or by the use of hydrophilic complexing \nagents e.g. sulphate ions. Simple hydroxamic acids (XHA) are salt free, hydrophilic \norganic compounds with the formula RCONHOH and so can act as di-oxygen ligands \nwith affinities for \u2018hard\u2019 cations such as Fe3+, Np4+ and Pu4+ [3-6] with which they form \n5-membered chelate rings. They are also redox active, capable of reducing a range of \nmetal ions - for instance they very rapidly reduce Np(VI) to Np(V) [7]. These two \nproperties have led to them being identified as useful reagents for the control of Pu and \nNp in an Advanced Purex and UREX processes [2,6,8-9]. \nAcid hydrolysis of free hydroxamic acids to hydroxylamine (itself a reducing agent for \na range of actinide species [10,11]) and the parent carboxylic acid is well known [12]. \nThe kinetics of the hydrolysis of formohydroxamic acid (FHA, R=H) and \nacetohydroxamic acid (AHA, R=CH3) in nitric acid have been determined [13] and are \nfound, at [HNO3] < 3 mol\u2022dm-3 and when [HNO3] > [XHA], to obey eq. 1: \n]H][XHA[Ae\ndt\n]XHA[d\nRT\nAE +\u2212=\u2212  (1)\nwhere, for FHA and AHA respectively, A, the pre-exponential factor, is 9.09 x 109 and \n3.22 x 109 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 and EA, the activation energy, is 77.3 and 79.9 kJ \u2022mol-1. \nHydrolysis of metal ion bound-hydroxamates also occurs. Additionally, preliminary \nstudies have shown that the Pu(IV)-FHA and AHA complexes are slowly reduced to \nfree Pu(III) ions [9]. An understanding of these processes is vital if they are to be \n3 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \ncontrolled within the design of an XHA-based Advanced Purex process. To this end, we \nhave experimentally studied and theoretically modelled the kinetics of the hydrolysis of \nmetal-XHA systems in nitrate media where (i) the metal ion complexes with, but does \nnot oxidise the ligand (Fe3+ \/ AHA; Np4+ \/ FHA, Np4+\/AHA); (ii) the metal ion both \ncomplexes and oxidises the ligand (Pu4+ \/ FHA and Pu4+ \/ AHA). This paper reports our \nfindings with respect to an example of the first class of experiments i.e. the hydrolysis \nof an XHA in the presence of a complexing, but non-oxidising metal ion \u2013 specifically \nthe hydrolysis of AHA (structure shown in I) in the presence of Fe3+ ions.  \n \nI \u2013 acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) \nThe experiments and kinetic modelling protocols developed will subsequently be used \nin similar studies of Np(IV)-XHA systems or adapted for use in the study of the Pu(IV)-\nXHA systems. The findings of the Np(IV)-XHA and Pu(IV)-XHA experiments will \nform the bases of the next two papers in this series. \n \n2. Experimental Methods \n2.1. Materials \nAll reagents, including HNO3 (70%, AnalaR, BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, Dorset, UK), \nAHA (98%, Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK) and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (>99%, AnalaR, \nBDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, Dorset, UK) were obtained from reputable suppliers at the \n4 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nhighest available purity and used as received. AHA was stored in a conventional \nrefrigerator at 4\u00b0C in order to prevent its decomposition. Solutions of AHA were \nprepared immediately prior to experiment. Solutions were prepared using doubly \ndistilled water, produced by a home-made still and further purified by a deionisation \nsystem (E pure model 04642, Barnstead \/ Thermodyne, Dubuque, Iowa, USA) to a \nresistivity of 1.8 x 105 \u03a9 m. \n2.2. Procedures \nUV-visible absorbance spectra of complex and complex precursor solutions were \nmeasured by spectrophotometry (Diode Array model 8452A, Hewlett Packard, USA) \nfitted with a HP89090A Peltier temperature controller. \nFor kinetic experiments, a single wavelength spectrophotometer (Model SP6-350, Pye-\nUnicam, UK) was set to measure absorbance at \u03bb = 498 nm, the absorption maximum of \nthe mono-acetohydroxamato complex (vide infra). Solutions for the kinetic experiments \nwere prepared from stock (Fe(III)) or freshly made solutions (AHA) and pipetted into \nan optical cuvette (pathlength 1 cm). The complexant (AHA) was added last. The \nvolume of complexant required was always small and had no effect on the temperature \nof the receiving solution when added. After mixing, the absorbance was then measured \nmanually at appropriate time intervals. \nAll experiments were conducted at 293 \u00b1 1 K. All experiments involving Fe(III) were \nconducted at pH < 2.5. However, it is well known that Fe3+ readily hydrolyses in water \nin accordance with: \n+++ +\u21d4+ HFeOHOHFe 223   \n5 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nthis equilibrium being the first step in a series of deprotonation \/ polymerisation \nreactions that ultimately result in the formation of ferric hydroxides and oxyhydroxides. \nUsing the most recently published, critically assessed Gibbs energies of formation of the \nvarious species involved [14,15], the equilibrium constant for this first deprotonation can be \ncalculated as being equal to 6.78 x 10-3, corresponding to a pKa(Fe3+) of 2.17. Thus, as \nhydrolysis to form Fe(OH)2+ will become significant above pH = 2.17, only those data recorded \nat pH = 2.1 and below will be subjected to rigorous experimental interpretation and modelling. \nData recorded in the range 2.1 < pH < 2.5, where shown, is presented for the purposes of \ncontext only. \n \n6 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Speciation and Kinetic Modelling of Metal-Hydroxamic Acid Systems \nThe ferric-AHA system exhibits three complexes at AHA:Fe ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1. All \nthree are intensely coloured being purple (\u03bbmax = 498 nm), red-brown (\u03bbmax = 460 nm) \nand orange-brown (\u03bbmax = 440 nm) respectively. Interconversions between the free \nmetal and the complexes can be described by the following [16,17], all at 298 K: \n+++ +\u21d4+ HFeLFeHL 23  K1 = 109 (2a)\n+++ +\u21d4+ HFeLFeLHL 22  K2 = 2.04 (2b)\n++ +\u21d4+ HFeLFeLHL 32  K3 = 7.4 x 10-3 (2c)\nwhere HL = hydroxamic acid, L = hydroxamate anion.  \nThe dynamics of the hydrolysis of the metal-AHA system in HNO3 media are \ncomplicated by the speciation of the complex. Thus, in order to aid data treatment, \nspeciation diagrams were calculated for the Fe(III)-AHA systems at 298 K at a range of \n[AHA], pH and pHL, Figs.1 & 2, where pH = -log10[H+] and pHL = -log10[AHA]. \nWe assume the following mechanism in modelling the hydrolysis of XHA in the \npresence of non-oxidising ions such as Fe(III) and Np(IV) \u2013 and that the dominant form \nof the complex is the mono-hydroxamato species ML. \n++\u23af\u2192\u2190+ HCMHL 1K  (3)\n++ +\u23af\u2192\u23af+ OHNHRCOOHHHL 3k0  (4)\n++ ++\u23af\u2192\u23af+ OHNHRCOOHMmHC 3k1  (5)\nwhere M = [Fe3+] or [Np4+] and Mt  =  [Fe3+] or [Np4+] at time t; (6a)\n7 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n HLt  =  [XHA] at time t; (6b)\n Ct  =  [metal ion-XHA complex] at time t; (6c)\n k\u20191  =  k1[H+]m  assumed by analogy with (6d)\n k\u20190  =  k0[H+]  in accordance with eq. 1. (6e)\nThe equilibrium described by K1 is given by: \n[ ]\nHLM\nHCK1\n+\n=  (7) \nThe forward and back reactions associated with eqs. 2 are assumed to be fast on the \ntimescale of XHA hydrolysis and so at equilibrium throughout the experiment. Further, \ngiven that the pKa of both hydroxamic acids investigated in this study and subsequent \npapers in this series are greater than 8.5 [18] (pKa (FHA) = 8.78; pKa (AHA) = 9.02), \nunder the conditions employed in the experiments described below (pH < 2.5), the \ndominant form of the free ligand will be the acid rather than the deprotonated conjugate \nbase. Thus, direct hydrolysis of the hydroxamate ion may be neglected.

Curve fitting these to \nexperimental data allows for the extraction of values of key parameters such as k\u20191 = \nk1[H+]m as a function of [H+]. A plot of log10 (k1[H+]m) vs log[H+] then allows \ncalculation of values of m and k1. \n3.2 Experimental Study of the Iron-Acetohydroxamic Acid System \nFigs.1 & 2 allow for the recording of separate UV-visible spectra under conditions \nwhen Fe(AHA)2+, Fe(AHA)2+ and Fe(AHA)3 are the dominant complex species. \nExamples of such spectra are shown in Fig.3. These allow the identification of \u03bbmax \nvalues for Fe(AHA)2+ and Fe(AHA)2+ of 498 nm and 460 nm respectively. Use of Fig.3 \nin conjunction with Figs.2b, 1a and 1b allows for the calculation of the following \nextinction coefficients: \nFor Fe(AHA)2+, \u03b5 = 1070 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 at \u03bbmax = 498 nm; \u03b5 = 913 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 at \n\u03bb = 460 nm. \nFor Fe(AHA)2+, \u03b5 = 932 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 at \u03bbmax = 460 nm; \u03b5 = 774 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 at \u03bb \n= 498 nm. \nFigs.1 & 2 also show that, at MT = 0.0025 mol\u2022dm-3 and pHL > 2.4, the mono-\nacetohydroxamato-Fe(III) complex forms >90% of all complexed Fe at pH < 1.5, so \n10 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \ndefining the [AHA] and pH range over which kinetic experiments may be conducted \nwherein, for ease of analysis, complexed Fe exists near-exclusively as the Fe(AHA)2+ \ncomplex.  \nWith these experimental and analytical restrictions in mind, and in order to test the \nrange of utility of the various assumptions made, acetohydroxamato-Fe(III) complex \nhydrolysis experiments were conducted at 293 K at a total iron concentration of 0.0025 \nmol\u2022dm-3, a total AHA concentration of 0.004 mol\u2022dm-3 (AHA:Fe ratio = 1.6:1) and at \npH \u2264 2.5, although it should be borne in mind that experiments conducted in the range \n2.1 < pH \u2264 2.5 may be complicated by the hydrolysis of Fe3+ to form Fe(OH)2+. The \nresults of these experiments are shown in Fig.4. Taken from Fig.4, Fig.5 shows the \ninitial absorbance due to complexed Fe3+ at \u03bb = 498 nm, as a function of pH, data at pH \n> 2.1 having been discarded due to quantitative analysis being complicated by the \npotential formation of Fe(OH)2+. Superimposed over this data set are three theoretical \nabsorbance traces, all calculated at \u03bb = 498 nm using the speciation data of Fig.2b: \n(i) the absorbance due to the 1:1 complex calculated using \u03b5 = 1070 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 \n(ii) the absorbance due to the 2:1 complex calculated using \u03b5 = 774 dm3\u2022mol-1\u2022cm-1 \n(iii)the sum of both absorbances. \nThere is reasonable correspondence between the calculated total and experimental \nabsorbance values. Comparison of the calculated total absorbance trace and that \ncalculated trace due to Fe(AHA)2+ indicates that, under the experimental conditions \nemployed, the 1:1 complex is responsible for >90% of the measured absorbance at pH < \n1.7. This supports the analysis above that at MT = 0.0025 mol\u2022dm-3 and pHL > 2.4, the \n1:1 complex forms >90% of all complexed iron at pH < 1.5. The absorbance measured \n11 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nfor all data recorded at pH < 1.7 is therefore predominantly due to Fe(AHA)2+, so \nallowing use of the experimental model described by eqs. 7-15 and data analysis by \ncurve fitting with eqs. 11 and 15. This curve fitting is facilitated by the observation of k1 \nand K\u20191 having different effects on the shape of the calculated Ct vs t curve. These \neffects are illustrated in Fig.6 and may be qualitatively understood as follows. \nThe rate parameter k1 affects the overall duration of the decrease in concentration of \ncomplex with time, although this effect is found to vanish for very small values of k1. \nThis is readily understood in that once the process associated with k1 (eq. 5) is much \nslower than the parallel process associated with k0 (eq. 4) (i.e. k1[H+]m << k0[H+]), the \nlatter process determines the overall rate. In contrast, no matter the overall duration of \nthe decay in complex concentration, the equilibrium constant K\u20191 only affects the degree \nof sigmoid character in the Ct vs t profile with a pseudo-induction period appearing at \nlarge K\u20191 during which Ct is invariant with time. The larger K\u20191 at any one set of \notherwise constant experimental conditions, the longer the induction period before the \nconcentration starts to decay. Again, this may be readily understood in that the larger \nK\u20191, the longer a significant \/ measurable concentration of complex will maintain during \nthe overall decay time. Curve fitting the data of Fig.4 is further facilitated by only one \nparameter being unknown in this instance: k\u20191 (= k1[H+]m, eq. 6d). Using Fig.4, the \ncurve fitting procedure can be conducted on data recorded as a function of [H+], so \nallowing m and k1 to be determined from a plot of log10k\u20191 vs log10[H+] (eq. 6d). \nFig.7 shows the data of Fig.4, normalised with respect to the absorbance at t=0, and \nassociated theoretical fits generated using eqs. 11 and 15, also normalised with respect \nto the calculated [Fe(AHA)2+] at t=0. Parameters used in the generation of each fitting \n12 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nplot are listed in table 1. Data at pH 2.5 have again been excluded from quantitative \nanalysis due to potential complications arising from Fe(OH)2+ formation. Of particular \ninterest are: \n\u2022 at all pH bar \u20130.7, k1[H+]m > k0[H+] indicating that complexed acetohydoxamate is \nmore susceptible to acid-catalysed hydrolysis than free AHA. \n\u2022 k1 has a negative value at pH \u20130.7 \u2013 this will be explored below. \nFrom table 1 and in accordance with eq. 6d, Fig.8 shows a plot of log10 (k1[H+]m) vs \nlog10[H+], excluding data at pH 2.5 (vide supra) and 2.01 (outside the range where the \nmonoacetohydroxamato complex can be assumed to be the dominant form of \ncomplexed ferric ions) and pH \u20130.7 (due to the above-mentioned negative value of k1). \nThe slope and intercept of the plot in Fig.8 give values of m and k1 of 0.97 and 1.02 x \n10-4 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 respectively.  \nAccording to Monzyk and Crumbliss, the forward and back reactions associated with \neq. 2a have rate coefficient values of 2 x 103 and 7.6 x 10-2 dm3 mol-1 s-1 respectively \n[17]. As the rate coefficients for the hydrolysis of free AHA and AHA within the 1:1 \ncomplex are 1.84 x 10-5 (see table 1) and 1.02 x 10-4 dm3 mol-1 s-1 respectively, our \nearlier assumption of the reaction associated with eq. 2a being at equilibrium throughout \nthe experiments reported here can be seen to be justified. This validates the use of eqs. \n11 and 15 in the analysis of the data of Figs.4 and 7. \nThe negative value of k\u20191 obtained at pH = -0.7 is due to the lower pH limit of \napplicability of eq. 1 being approximately pH \u20130.5. This limit is thought to arise from a \npossible change in the mechanism of acid-catalysed hydrolysis of free AHA at or \naround pH \u20130.5. The mechanism at pH > -0.5 has long been thought to involve [12]: \n13 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n(i)  rapid pre-equilibrium protonation of the carbonyl oxygen; followed by  \n(ii)  nucleophilic attack by water at the carbonyl carbon, resulting in the formation of a \ntetrahedral intermediate; followed by  \n(iii) re-creation of carbonyl at the new tetrahedral C with loss of leaving group NH2OH \n(see Fig.9). \nTaylor et al report that in nitric acid (< 3 mol\u2022dm-3), XHAs hydrolyse in accordance \nwith this mechanism to give hydroxylamine and the parent carboxylic acid, the rate \nobeying eq. 1 [13]. Modena et al have also investigated the hydrolysis of \npropanhydroxamic acid in sulphuric and nitric acid and found that both acids exert an \nidentical catalytic effect with the rates passing through a maximum as a function of [H+] \n[20]. Buglass and Juffkins have reported a similar rate maximum in a series of studies \non 2,2-dimethylacetohydroxamic acid [21]. This experimental rate maximum is \ntherefore a departure from the applicability of eq. 1 at high [H+], with k\u20190 values \ncalculated using eq. 1 at  pH < -0.5 being greater than those obtained by experiment \u2013 so \naccounting for the negative value of k\u20191 = k1[H+]m obtained in table 1. Several \nexplanations have been forwarded to explain this change in mechanism and which of \nthese, if any, are true is still uncertain [12]: \n(a) rate saturation at high [H+] due to complete conversion of the (weakly) basic \nsubstrate into its conjugate acid; \n(b) the acid-base pre-equilibrium steps and transition state formation steps being \ngoverned by different acidity functions; \n(c) a change in the initial protonation site from the carbonyl O to the hydroxylamino N \n(see Fig.9). \n14 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nIt is our view that it is the first of these explanations that is most applicable for the \nsystem studied here. Whilst experiments are underway in our laboratories to verify this \nview, an early indication of its validity is provided by the data of Fig.10 which again \npresents the experimental data recorded at pH \u20130.7 from Fig.7. However, in this \ninstance, rather than taking the literature value of K\u20191, a value of k\u20190 calculated in \naccordance with eq. 1 and then obtaining the best fit by variation of k\u20191, k\u20191 has first \nbeen calculated using eq. 6d and the values of m and k1 of 0.97 and 1.02 x 10-4 dm3 \n\u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 obtained above. The theoretical fit has then been obtained by varying k\u20190 \nwithin eqs. 11 and 15. The fit shown in Fig.10 was obtained using a value of k\u20190 of 5.51 \nx 10-5 s-1, which is less than the value of k\u20190 = 9.2 x 10-5 s-1 calculated by use of eqs. 1 \nand 6e at pH \u20130.7. Eq. 1 predicts a value of the second order rate constant k0 of 1.84 x \n10-5 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 (see table 1). Dividing the fitted value of k\u20190 of 5.51 x 10-5 s-1 by k0 \n= 1.84 x 10-5 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 gives a value of [H+] = 3 mol\u2022dm-3, this despite the \nexperiment having been conducted at pH \u20130.7, corresponding to [H+] = 5.01 mol\u2022dm-3. \nThis effective value of [H+] = 3 mol\u2022dm-3, corresponding to pH \u20130.48, is coincident \nwith the upper limit of applicability of eq. 1 reported by Taylor et al [13] and the acidity \nat which Buglass and Juffkins report that the rate of hydrolysis of 2,2-\ndimethylacetohydroxamic acid saturates [21]. In light of this result, we suggest that of \nthe three above suggested explanations of the hydrolytic behaviour of free AHA at low \npH, explanation (a) is the most likely to obtain i.e. that deviation from eq. 1 at high \nacidity is caused by a saturation in the protonation of carbonyl group of AHA to form \nits conjugate acid AHAH+. According to the generally accepted mechanism (i)-(iii) \nabove, AHAH+ is then the species that undergoes nucleophilic attack by water to form \nthe observed reaction products. Consequently, the measured rate of hydrolysis of free \n15 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nAHA would be expected to be proportional to the instantaneous concentration of \nAHAH+. \nFrom table 1 it is apparent that complexation of AHA with Fe3+ to form a 1:1 complex \naccelerates the hydrolysis of AHA at pH > -0.5 at 293 K. This can be understood by \nfirst noting that m = 1 for the hydrolysis of both the free and bound AHA, suggesting \nthat the same general mechanism obtains in each system at pH > -0.48 i.e. rapid pre-\nequilibrium protonation of the carbonyl oxygen of the bound AHA is followed by \nnucleophilic attack by water on the carbonyl carbon (mechanism (i)-(iii) above). With \nthis in mind, acceleration by complexation at pH > -0.5 is consistent with the \nobservation that, through a Hammett equation analysis, electron withdrawing \nsubstituents (X in XHA, the metal in the hydroxamato-metal complex) accelerate the \nhydrolysis of AHA by increasing the susceptibility of the carbon of the hydroxamate \ncarbonyl group to nucleophilic attack by H2O.  \nIt is of interest to note that, at 1.48 \u2265 pH \u2265 0.49, k1 is approximately 5.6x greater than \nk0. Table 2 compares the hydrolytic half life of free AHA, (t\u00bd)0, with that of AHA in the \npresence of Fe3+ as determined from the experimental data of Fig.7. This comparison \nindicates that hydrolysis in the presence of Fe3+ is at most 3x faster than that of free \nAHA, reflecting the incomplete complexation of AHA with ferric ions. The greatest \ndifference between the rate ratio expected on the basis of k1\/k0 with that determined \nexperimentally is seen at low pH, reflecting the lower levels of mono-acetohydroxamato \ncomplex formed at high acidities (Fig.2b). \nFinally, let us return to our conclusion that the deviation at pH < -0.48 of the measured \nvalue of k\u20190 from that calculated using eq. 1 is due to complete conversion of AHA into \n16 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nits conjugate acid AHAH+ (explanation (a) above). If such a secenario were to obtain \nthen a speciation diagram of the type shown in Fig.11 would apply. Concentrations of \nAHAH+ and AHA over the pH range shown are then given by \nT\nA\n]AHA[\n]H[K\n]H[]AHAH[ +\n++\n+=  \n(16a)\nT\nA\nA ]AHA[\n]H[K\nK\n]AHA[ ++=  \n(16b)\nwhere [AHA]T = [AHA] + [AHAH+] and KA is the equilibrium constant for: \n++ +\u21d4 HAHAAHAH  (17)\nEq. 16a has two asymptotic forms. At high pH, [H+] < KA and eq. 16a reduces to:  \nT\nA\n]AHA[\nK\n]H[]AHAH[\n++ =  (18a)\nwhich, if the rate of free AHA hydrolysis is taken to be proportional to [AHAH+] (vide \nsupra) is consistent with the experimental dependence of that rate on total AHA \nconcentration and [H+] given in eq. 1. At low pH, [H+] > KA and eq. 16a reduces to: \nT]AHA[]AHAH[ =+  (18b)\nand the rate becomes invariant with pH. Eq. 16 and eq. 18a therefore suggest that k\u20190 for \nhydrolysis of the free ligand is most appropriately written as \n]H[k]H[\nK]H[\nk\n'k 0\nA\nH\n0\n0\n++\n+ \u2248+=  \n(19a)\nwhere k0H is the pseudo-first order rate coefficient for the nucleophilic attack of water \non free AHAH+. An analogous equation can be written for the complexed ligand: \n]H[k]H[\nK]H[\nk\n'k 1\nC,A\nH\n1\n1\n++\n+ \u2248+=  \n(19b)\n17 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nwhere KA,C is the equilibrium constant for the process analogous to eq. 17 that occurs \nwith complexed AHA. \nReturning to the free ligand, schematic plots of eq. 16a, 18a and 18b are shown in \nFig.12 from which it can be seen that, at the point of intersection of the plots derived \nfrom asymptotic eqs. 18a and 18b, [H+] = KA. From eq. 19a, it can be seen that this \nvalue of [H+] can also be determined by dividing the value of k0 calculated from eq. 1 \ninto the (saturation) value of k\u20190 obtained by the curve fitting of Fig.10. Consequently, \nKA for the equilibrium given by eq. 17 can be seen to have a value of 3 mol\u2022dm-3. \nFig.11 shows the speciation diagram obtained from eqs. 16 using KA = 3 mol\u2022dm-3and a \ntotal concentration of acetohydroxamic acid = 0.0025 mol\u2022dm-3. \nIn using the data of Fig.10 in this computation of KA, we are necessarily assuming that \nthe protonation of the carbonyl oxygen in the complexed ligand has yet to achieve \nsaturation at pH \u20130.7 i.e. k\u20191 = k1[H+] where k1 = 1.02 x 10-4 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 obtained \nabove. This is not unreasonable as AHA complexation with Fe3+ to form a complex of \nthe type shown in Fig.9 will necessarily make the lone pairs on the carbonyl oxygen less \navailable for protonation. Thus KA,C for the complexed ligand will be greater than KA \nfor the free, with the degree of ligand protonation and so level of hydrolytically active \nAHAH+ formation being suppressed upon complexation. Returning to table 1, \ncomparison of k\u20191 with k\u20190 in the context of eqs. 19 and the deduction that KA,C > KA, \nthen indicates that k1H > k0H i.e. that the rate of nucleophilic attack of water on the \ncarbonyl carbon is greater for complexed than free AHAH+. This deduction is consistent \nwith the Hammett-based analysis above i.e. that electron withdrawing groups on the \ncarbonyl will increase the susceptibility of the carbonyl carbon to nucleophilic attack. \n18 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \n \n4. Conclusions \nAcid catalysed hydrolysis of free XHAs is well known and may impact negatively upon \ntheir potential applications in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. Hydrolysis of the metal \nbound ligand within metal ion-XHA complexes is less well understood. In order to \nelucidate the effect of complexation on the hydrolysis reaction, we have with the aid of \nspeciation diagrams, modelled and explained UV-visible spectrophotometric kinetic \nstudies of the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) whilst bound to \nthe model ion Fe(III). Kinetic models have been developed and used to obtain the \nfollowing for the hydrolysis of AHA in the Fe(AHA)2+ complex at 293 K: \n(i) the second order rate parameter, k1=1.02 x 10-4 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1; and \n(ii) the order with respect to [H+] during the rate determining step, m = 0.97. \nThe latter indicates that the mechanism for the hydrolysis of complexed AHA is \nanalogous to that of the free ligand i.e. rapid pre-equilibrium protonation of the carbonyl \noxygen (pKa = -0.48) followed by nucleophilic attack by water on the carbonyl carbon. \nThe value of the former, k1, is greater than the analogous parameter for hydrolysis of the \nfree ligand, k0 = 1.84 x 10-5 dm3 \u2022mol-1 \u2022s-1 at all pH > -0.5. This is consistent with a \nHammett-based analysis wherein electron withdrawing groups (the metal during \ncomplexation) accelerate AHA hydrolysis by increasing the susceptibility of the \ncarbonyl group to nucleophilic attack. \n \n19 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to thank British Nuclear Fuels Ltd and the Nuclear Decommissioning \nAuthority (NDA) for financial support and for a post-doctoral research fellowship for \nFA. \n20 \nHydroxamate complex hydrolysis  Andrieux et al \nReferences \n[1] Dennis, I.S., Jeapes, A.P., Reprocessing Irradiated Fuel.
