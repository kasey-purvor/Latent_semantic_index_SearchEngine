Even\nwithin the relatively homogeneous subset of the world\u2019s economically most developed nations (the OECD\nmember countries), the diversity is considerable. In Greece, approximately one in five in the labor force is a\n(non-agricultural) business owner, whereas in Finland approximately one in fourteen operates a business of\nhis own (average rates 1972-2004) (see e.g. van Stel, 2005; Thurik and Wennekers, 2004). A well-known\napproach explains this disparity by differences in prosperity (Kuznets, 1971). The richer the country, the\nfewer business owners there are. However, the first cracks in this negative relationship appeared in the late\nseventies (Blau, 1987 and Acs, Carlson and Karlsson, 1999). In fact, the negative relationship between\nprosperity and business ownership now seems to be breaking down in several (but not all) of the most\nprosperous countries, as they have shown a resurgence of business ownership rates in the past decades (see\nCarree, van Stel, Thurik and Wennekers, 2002, and van Stel and Carree, 2004, for an analysis of the\nrelationship between economic development and business ownership, and Carree and Thurik, 2003, for a\nliterature survey). Moreover, the dominance of economic variables explaining business ownership rates has\nbeen questioned, and other explanatory factors, such as culture, have been brought forward (Hofstede et al.,\n2004).\nSlowly, data material has become available showing that business ownership rates follow some U-\nshaped path when related to the level of economic development (Thurik and Wennekers, 2004). The switch\nbetween the downward phase of this U-shape and the upward one has to do with the changing role of\nentrepreneurial activities. The role of entrepreneurship has changed dramatically, fundamentally shifting\nbetween what Audretsch and Thurik (2001) introduced as the model of the managed economy and that of\nthe entrepreneurial economy. In particular, Audretsch and Thurik (2001) argue that the model of the\nmanaged economy is the political, social and economic response to an economy dictated by the forces of\nlarge-scale production, reflecting the predominance of the production factors of capital and (unskilled) labor\nas the sources of competitive advantage (see also Audretsch and Thurik , 2004). By contrast, the model of\nthe entrepreneurial economy is the political, social and economic response to an economy dictated not just\nby the dominance of the production factor of knowledge - which can be identified as replacing the more\ntraditional factors as the source of competitive advantage \u2013 but also by a very different, but complementary,\nfactor: entrepreneurship capital, or the capacity to engage in and generate entrepreneurial activity. By and\nlarge, countries first move from a predominantly rural economy with a high level of business ownership to\nan industrial one where scale economies dominate, and then again to a service economy where small scale\nentrepreneurial activities are essential in many industries (see Wennekers, van Stel, Thurik and Reynolds,\n2005, for an example of the U-shape using data material of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor).\nDifferences in the business ownership rate between countries seem to be persistent despite the U-\nshaped path that appears driven by the level of economic development. There is a general intuition that\ncultural rather than economic variables play a role in explaining these differences, since cultural aspects are\nrelatively time invariant (Noorderhaven, Thurik, Wennekers and van Stel, 2004). The present paper\ninvestigates the role of uncertainty avoidance. Elsewhere the role of variables such as post-materialism and\ndissatisfaction is studied (Uhlaner and Thurik, 2007 and Noorderhaven et al., 2004).\nAt the individual level, the decision to become a business owner can be viewed as the outcome of a\nprocess of occupational choice. This approach views agents as utility maximizers making an occupational\nchoice decision \u2013 to become employee or business owner \u2013 on the grounds of the utility associated with the\nexpected returns from the two activity types.1 Personal characteristics2 as well as cultural, institutional and\n1 This approach is rooted in the work of Knight (1921) and starts from the functions of the provision of entrepreneurial ability and\nthe bearing of risks. The second function underlines the importance of risk attitudes in the occupational choice process. See, for\ninstance, Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) and Parker (1997), where the degree of risk aversion and the differences in risk of becoming\na business owner vis-\u00e0-vis an employee are given the central role in the determination of the occupational choice. See also Freytag\nand Thurik (2007).\n3economic conditions will influence these individual choices. An aggregation of these occupational choices\nat the level of countries shows the cumulative and interactive influence of the different determinants\n(Verheul, Wennekers, Audretsch and Thurik, 2002). In the present paper, we will focus on a specific\ncultural determinant of business ownership, viz., uncertainty avoidance, which to date has received only\nscant attention.\nOur first research question considers the concepts of uncertainty and risk and the relevance of\ncultural attitudes towards uncertainty for the occupational choice with respect to business ownership. What\neffects of uncertainty avoidance on the choice for business ownership can be assumed to exist at the\nindividual level, and how does this influence work at the country level? Our second question pertains to the\ndirect influence of uncertainty avoidance on the prevalence of business ownership at the country level. Are\ndifferences in business ownership rates at the country level related to differences in uncertainty avoidance?\nOur third question deals with an indirect role of uncertainty avoidance through an influence on the\nrelationship between GDP per capita and business ownership. Do differences in uncertainty avoidance alter\nthe trade-offs between the opportunity costs and benefits of entrepreneurship in relationship to the level of\neconomic development, and hence indirectly affect business ownership rates?\nUNCERTAINTY, RISK AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP\nSome classical and neoclassical views\nSince the publication in 1921 of Knight\u2019s dissertation Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, it has become\ncommon usage in the social sciences to distinguish between risk and (true) uncertainty (van Praag, 1999:\n322). Uncertainty is a basic fact of life. We speak of uncertainty when \u2018anything might happen\u2019. Relevant\nexamples in the economic domain are new inventions and changing consumer preferences. Basically, these\nare unique events. Hence there is no statistical basis for calculating a probability. Risk is a special case of\nuncertainty. It relates to \u2018disagreeable\u2019 events for which past instances may be assembled and analyzed, such\nas fire-damage or the insolvency of debtors. According to the Oxford Concise Dictionary, tenth edition,\n1999, risk is \u201cthe possibility that something unpleasant will happen\u201d. Risk is often expressed in a percentage\nor probability and, accordingly, is to some extent insurable.\nAccording to Knight, the entrepreneur\u2019s main function is bearing the real uncertainty by making\njudgmental decisions in the face of incalculable and uninsurable business hazards (van Praag, 1999: 322-\n323).3 Knight\u2019s writings present an elaboration and generalization of Cantillon\u2019s views on entrepreneurship\nthat were originally published in 1755 and in which the main entrepreneurial function is arbitrage between\nsupply and demand. \u201cAs Cantillon describes it, entrepreneurs buy at a certain price to sell again at an\nuncertain price, with the difference being their profit or loss\u201d (H\u00e9bert and Link, 1989: 42). Most (neo)-\nclassical authors, including Say and Marshall, view entrepreneurs as being responsible for risk-bearing (van\nPraag, 1999: 327). Later authors on entrepreneurship, particularly those in the (neo)-Austrian tradition (such\nas Kirzner), emphasize the entrepreneurial quality of perception of opportunities in the face of uncertainty.\nBy contrast, Schumpeter (1934) in his well-known Theory of Economic Development (reprinted in\nSwedberg, 2000: 58) emphasizes the innovative function of the entrepreneur, the person who introduces\n\u2018new combinations\u2019 of productive means. Schumpeter\u2019s view \u201cdisposes of the conception of the\nentrepreneur as risk bearer\u201d. In a footnote, Schumpeter continues: \u201cRisk obviously always falls on the owner\nof the means of production, \u2026., hence never on the entrepreneur as such\u201d. Finally, T.W. Schultz (1975)\ndefines \u201centrepreneurship as the ability to deal with disequilibria, rather than the ability to deal with\nuncertainty\u201d (H\u00e9bert and Link, 1989: 46). For Schultz, the bearing of risk is involved in entrepreneurship but\nit is \u201cnot a unique attribute of entrepreneurs\u201d.\nIn neoclassical economics, the role of entrepreneurship is limited to the entry that follows profit\nopportunities (Carree and Thurik, 1995). Neoclassical economics suggests that there are a set of possible\n2 See Blanchflower and Meyer (1994), Blanchflower and Oswald (1998), Douglas and Shepherd (2002), Evans and Leighton (1989,\n1990), Grilo and Irigoyen (2006), Grilo and Thurik (2005a and 2005b) and Lin et al. (2000) for empirical work.\n3 There is no generally accepted definition of entrepreneurship. See Wennekers and Thurik (1999) for an overview. In the present\npaper, we adopt a pragmatic approach by equating entrepreneurship, business ownership and self-employment, and an entrepreneur\nwill simply be understood to be the owner\/manager of either an unincorporated or an incorporated business. See also Thurik and\nWennekers (2004) and Davidsson (2004).\n4outcomes and a set of probabilities that each of these outcomes will actually occur (Varian, 1992). Then, a\ndistinction is made between risk and uncertainty. The distribution of probabilities says something about the\namount of risk. If the probabilities are not known, the term 'true uncertainty' is used. In neoclassical\neconomics, usually, the probabilities are assumed to be known. With regard to entrepreneurship and entry,\nthe profit opportunities are supposed to be known and accessible to everybody. Therefore, pure uncertainty\nis commonly disregarded (Choi, 1993 and Wubben, 1993).\nEconomists such as Knight and Keynes and economic schools such as the Austrians and the Post-\nKeynesians have given uncertainty more emphasis (Wubben, 1993). They define uncertainty in similar\nterms, but state that \u201cespecially entrepreneurs do not know the full range of outcomes nor their possibilities\nof occurring\u201d (Lachmann, in Wubben, 1993).\nContemporary views on risk-attitudes of entrepreneurs\nThe topic of risk (i.e. chance of failure) has remained current in more recent academic literature on\nentrepreneurship. Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) emphasize that individuals differ in \u2018risk aversion\u2019. In their\nmodel, \u201cmore risk averse individuals become workers while the less risk averse become entrepreneurs\u201d.\nLikewise, Iyigun and Owen (1998) model the occupational choice between \u2018inherently risky entrepreneurial\nventures\u2019 and relatively \u2018safe\u2019 alternatives such as professional activities.\nMcGrath, MacMillan and Scheinberg (1992) compare values, including attitudes towards risk and\nfailure, of entrepreneurs (founder-managers of stand-alone businesses that were at least two years old and\nemployed at least one other person) and non-entrepreneurs in eight nations. Entrepreneurs were found to\nagree more often with statements such as \u2018start-up means risk but also excitement\u2019, whereas non-\nentrepreneurs agreed more to \u2018failure means losing face\/respect\u2019. Van Praag (1996) investigates which\nabilities and attitudes predispose individuals to entrepreneurship. In a sample of 1,763 economically active\n(Dutch) adults in their early fifties in 1993, more risk averse individuals were found to have a significantly\nsmaller probability of being a business owner or having been one in the past.\nUncertainty is particularly relevant for start-up entrepreneurs because they cannot know the full\nrange of possible outcomes (Bhide, 1994). New business founders thus are often unable to calculate their\nfuture profits. For example, someone who plans a new outlet of an existing franchise chain might have a fair\nestimate of its success given the experiences with previous outlets. For founders of new businesses, or more\ngenerally for entrepreneurs who introduce an innovation, this does not hold.\nSynthesis of micro-economic views\nUncertainty is a concept that is central to entrepreneurship, as emphasized by eminent economists\nsuch as Cantillon, Mangoldt, Knight and Keynes (H\u00e9bert and Link, 1989; Ekelund and H\u00e9bert, 1990).\nWithout uncertainty, entrepreneurship would be unnecessary. In the East European socialist planning\neconomies, entrepreneurship was unnecessary and sometimes considered as criminal because a system of\ncomplete planning was assumed to result in optimal resource allocation. However, since uncertainty is a fact\nof economic life, entrepreneurs are needed to arbitrage, to take risks and to innovate (van Praag, 1996 and\nWennekers and Thurik, 1999). Entrepreneurs are considered to be the primary agents dealing with\nuncertainty in the economy. Entrepreneurs are called for in the fast changing economic reality of today\u2019s\nsociety (Audretsch and Thurik, 2000 and 2001). H\u00e9bert and Link (1989: 47) attempt to synthesize the many\ndiverging views. Their \u2018synthetic\u2019 definition of entrepreneurship incorporates (dealing with) uncertainty,\nrisk, perception of profit opportunities, innovation and change.\nUncertainty is a wider concept, encompassing risks and opportunities as well as distinguishing\nbetween degrees of uncertainty. These dimensions are elaborated in table 1. Across the rows of the table\nthere is a dichotomy distinguishing between possible unpleasant outcomes (\u2018risks\u2019) and possibilities of\nbusiness success (\u2018opportunities\u2019). Next, the columns represent different degrees of uncertainty. Column (1)\ndescribes the relatively low uncertainty when the possible outcomes and their probabilities are known. A\ncase in point is selling fire insurance or starting a new outlet of an existing franchise. Column (2) refers to\nmedium-high uncertainty in the sense that there is only a notion of possible outcomes and probabilities, such\nas may be the case with many new business start-ups. Business founders may not be able to calculate risks\nand expected profits, but they will often have a perception of the risks, opportunity costs and profit\n5opportunities of their venture. Column (3) describes the \u2018true\u2019 uncertainty of future loss or profit, inherent to\nlaunching a radical innovation or to investing financial capital in fundamental research.\nINSERT TABLE 1\nThere is agreement that entrepreneurs (in the sense of business owners) make judgmental decisions\nin the face of uncertainty, reap the rewards of perceiving and utilizing opportunities and in the process also\nrun the risk of losing their money and their reputation. There is also some consensus that entrepreneurs are\nless averse to risk, while alternative views hold that entrepreneurs are inherently more optimistic rather than\nless risk averse or dispose of relevant information reducing uncertainty and risk (Gifford, 2003: 37-41).\nCultural traits with respect to uncertainty\nAttitudes, such as risk aversion, pertain to individuals and may show a wide variety within groups.\nAt the \u2018ecological level\u2019 of nations, cultural traits related to these individual attitudes may be distinguished.\nEmpirically, these traits may be derived as mean, modal or extreme values of individual observations or\nthrough a direct analysis of \u2018ecological data\u2019 (pertaining to national practices and achievements). Cultural\ntraits represent a nation\u2019s \u2018mental programs\u2019 that are developed in socialization processes in the family in\nearly childhood and reinforced in schools and organizations (Hofstede, 2001: xix). Accordingly, cultural\ntraits may differ between societies.\nA cultural trait that is strongly associated with individual attitudes towards risk and uncertainty is\n\u2018uncertainty avoidance\u2019. According to Hofstede (2001: 146), uncertainty avoidance has to do with the extent\nto which societies tolerate ambiguity. A culture is characterized by high uncertainty avoidance when its\nmembers feel threatened by uncertain or unknown situations. People in these cultures \u201clook for structure in\ntheir organizations, institutions and relationships, which makes events clearly interpretable and predictable\u201d\n(Hofstede, 2001: 148.) In countries with lower uncertainty avoidance, \u201cnot only familiar but also unfamiliar\nrisks are accepted, such as changing jobs and starting activities for which there are no rules\u201d. Low\nuncertainty avoidance thus implies \u201cwillingness to enter into unknown ventures\u201d (Hofstede, 2001: 164).\nHofstede operationalizes uncertainty avoidance using three survey questions about whether employees feel\n\u201ccompany rules should not be broken even when the employee thinks it is in the company\u2019s best interests\u201d,\nabout their personal expected job stability and about how often they feel nervous or tense at work.\nRelevance of uncertainty avoidance for explaining the business ownership rate\nDirect effect of uncertainty avoidance\nA micro-economic model of occupational choice is introduced to clarify the ways in which\nuncertainty avoidance may have an impact on the prevalence of business ownership at the country level. In\nthis model, the individual choice between self-employment and wage-employment depends on a personal\nassessment and utility valuation of the expected material and immaterial rewards of these occupational\nalternatives, while taking the perceived risks into account (see Wennekers, 2006). For simplicity, we\noperationalize material rewards as the expected personal income generated by self-employment (E(I)SE),\ncompared with the wage one expects to earn in a job (E(I)WE). We reduce the immaterial rewards of self-\nemployment to a gain in autonomy compared with the degree of independence that an individual will\nexperience when working as an employee.\nBelow, we summarize the model in a schematic manner:\n(1) 10;)1(* ,,, \uf03c\uf03c\uf02d\uf02b\uf03d iiIRiiMRiiSE UUOC \uf061\uf061\uf061\n(2) 10;0);)()()1(( ,,,,, \uf03c\uf03c\uf03e\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d iSEiiWEiSEiSEiiMR IEIEU \uf072\uf062\uf072\uf062\n6(3) 0;, \uf03e\uf044\uf03d iiiiIR AUTU \uf067\uf067\nWhere\nOC*SE,i = latent variable measuring total utility of choice for self-employment (individual i)\nUMR,i = utility of expected change in material rewards due to self-employment\nUIR,i = utility of expected gain in immaterial rewards due to self-employment\nE(I)SE,i = expected income self-employment\nE(I)WE,i = expected income wage-employment\n\u0394AUTi = gain in autonomy (self-employment versus wage-employment)\n\uf061i = parameter reflecting the relative weight in utility of material vs immaterial rewards\n\uf062i = parameter transforming expected change in material rewards into utility\n\uf067i = parameter transforming expected gain in immaterial rewards into utility\n\u03c1SE,i = discount parameter for perceived risks of self-employment\nFor empirical application, an observable occupational choice variable OCSE,i might be added, where\nOCSE,i = 1 (i is self-employed) when OC*SE,i > 0 and OCSE,i = 0 (i is an employee) when OC*SE,i < 0. Parker\n(2004: 24-26) elaborates how this micro-economic model might be estimated after transformation into a\nprobit or logit model. This is, however, not necessary for our purpose, i.e. the underpinning of a macro-\neconomic regression model.\nWe assume that all parameters and variables in the model are idiosyncratic with respect to\nindividuals, i.e. we assume that, for each individual, parameters and variable values are randomly drawn\nfrom probability distributions. In addition, we assume that attitudes towards uncertainty and risk play a role\nin the assessments and utility valuations of the expected material and immaterial rewards. In particular, we\nassume that the distributions of \u03c1SE,i, \uf067i, and E(I)SE,i are systematically influenced by the individual level of\nuncertainty aversion. That is, ceteris paribus, the distributions of these three parameters and variables are\nlocated more to the right or to the left, depending on the individual level of uncertainty aversion. This will\nbe illustrated below. For simplicity let us assume that there are two groups of individuals, a group with a\nhigh uncertainty aversion level, H, and a group with a low uncertainty aversion level, L. First, it is assumed\nthat an aversion of uncertainty causes people to perceive fewer profit opportunities and to see more risks in\nentrepreneurship. This causes a downward bias in their assessments of the expected income of self-\nemployment, i.e. LSE,HSE, E(I)E(I) \uf03c , where the overscore denotes the median value of the distribution.\nSecond, they will also attach a lower utility to a certain expected income when they feel that higher risks are\ninvolved, i.e. LSE,HSE, \uf072\uf072 \uf03e . Third, it may be assumed that uncertainty averse individuals have a relatively\nlow valuation of autonomy, i.e. LH \uf067\uf067 \uf03c .\nThis model of individual occupational choice presents several bridges to the effects of uncertainty\navoidance for the macro-economic business ownership rate. First, a culture of high uncertainty avoidance\nmay imply a higher percentage of uncertainty\/risk averse individuals within the population.4 Applying our\nmicro-economic model at the macro level, this implies lower assessments of the expected entrepreneurial\nincome and a higher discount for perceived risks. On the other hand, countries with low uncertainty\navoidance will count more individuals with entrepreneurial values who attach a higher utility to the rewards\nof self-employment. These countries thus have a relatively large supply of potential entrepreneurs (see\nShane, 1993, for indirect support of this assumption). In terms of our model, this means that there will be\nmore people for whom the utility of the material rewards of self-employment (UMR) is positive (negative) in\n4 In terms of our illustration above, the group of individuals with a high uncertainty aversion level, H, is larger than in a culture with\nlow uncertainty avoidance.\n7countries with low (high) uncertainty avoidance.5 This gives rise to the hypothesis that the prevalence of\nself-employment is diminished by high uncertainty avoidance (UAI+), while it is stimulated by low\nuncertainty avoidance (UAI-). In our section on Method, two clusters of countries will be defined.\nHowever, there may also be an opposite effect because a culture of high uncertainty avoidance at the\ncountry level may be expected to imply a restrictive climate within existing firms and organizations. This\nwould offer a relatively large gain in autonomy (\u0394AUT) to individuals choosing self-employment. Even\nwhen there are fewer enterprising individuals in such an economy, UAI+ may push many of them towards\nself-employment. In terms of our model, this means that, on average, the utility of the immaterial rewards of\nself-employment (UIR) will be higher in countries with high uncertainty avoidance. This leads to the\nhypothesis that high uncertainty avoidance (UAI+) may stimulate self-employment (see Baum et al., 1993,\nfor an analogous reasoning with respect to the effect of low individualism at the country level).\nSummarizing, there are two contradicting hypotheses with respect to the direct influence of\nuncertainty avoidance on the supply of business owners. On average, an UAI+ culture will result in more\nindividuals with a relatively low value of UMR, but it will also result in more individuals with a relatively\nhigh value of UIR. The overall impact of these opposite forces (i.e. the net-effect on the business ownership\nrate) is a subject for empirical research.\nIndirect effect of uncertainty avoidance\nUncertainty avoidance may also have an indirect influence on the rate of business ownership, i.e. the\nlevel of uncertainty avoidance in a nation may influence the manner in which other variables determine\nbusiness ownership. For example, the degree to which increasing per capita income leads to a perception of\nincreasing opportunity costs of entrepreneurship (compared with well-paid, safe jobs) versus a perception of\nincreasing entrepreneurial opportunities (more niches; need for autonomy) may well be dependent on the\nlevel of uncertainty avoidance. Likewise, high unemployment levels may be interpreted as a decrease of the\nopportunity costs associated with business ownership, and hence stimulate entrepreneurship, but also with\nincreased likelihood of failure, and therefore negatively related with business ownership levels, depending\non the degree of uncertainty avoidance.\nMODELLING THE BUSINESS OWNERSHIP RATE\nThe dependent variable in this study is the rate of business ownership in a nation at a certain\nmoment in time. Our major interest is the direct and the indirect contribution of uncertainty avoidance to the\nvariance in business ownership across nations and over time. We position our study within a broad\nmultidisciplinary framework that is based on various strands of the entrepreneurship literature (see Verheul\net al., 2002, and Wennekers, 2006, for a description of this framework). From this framework, we choose\ncontrol variables for our regression model of the effects of uncertainty avoidance. Table 2 lists economic\nand demographic determinants of business ownership. Here, we not only focus on the underlying micro-\neconomic studies of occupational choice, but also refer to surveys and empirical macro-economic\ninvestigations. The first column also contains an operationalization of the determinants used in the empirical\nanalysis, while the final column indicates the data availability and the sources of the various variables. As\nwe will use data for business ownership (the dependent variable in our study) for the years 1976, 1990 and\n2004, and we will use a four year lag for the independent variables, we have aimed at collecting data for the\nyears 1972, 1986 and 2000 for the variables in table 2. However, when data are not available for one of\nthese years, we use data for the closest available year. This is also indicated in the final column of table 2.\nINSERT TABLE 2\n5 Note again that OC*SE,i in Equation (1) has to be positive in order for an individual to choose for self-employment, as the utility\nvariables in the model are defined relative to the situation of wage-employment.\n8Level of economic development\nIt has been observed in various studies that the business ownership rate decreases as economies\nbecome more developed (Schultz, 1990; Yamada, 1996; see Carree et al., 2002, for an overview). Economic\ndevelopment is usually measured by per capita income, but it is also reflected in the average wage rate. In\nthe present discussion, we will include both per capita income and the wage rate.\nA low level of prosperity usually coincides with a low wage level, implying little pressure to\nincrease efficiency or the average scale of enterprise. Small firms in agriculture, crafts and retail trade are\ntherefore dominant in such an economy. A major route for ambitious wage earners to increase their income,\nthen, is to set up shop and become an entrepreneur.\nSubsequently, economic development leads to a rise in wages, which stimulates enterprises to work\nmore efficiently and to reap economies of scale and scope (Chandler, 1990). Also, a declining share of\nagriculture and an increasing share of manufacturing diminish the opportunities for self-employment. At the\nsupply side of the labor market, an additional effect of rising wage levels is an increased attraction of wage-\nemployment, increasing the opportunity cost of self-employment (Lucas, 1978). Iyigun and Owen (1998)\nargue that with economic development the \u201csafe\u201d professional earnings will rise and fewer individuals will\nbe willing to risk becoming business owners.\nIn recent decades, statistical evidence points at a possible reversal of the negative relationship\nbetween real per capita income and self-employment at an advanced level of economic development. With\nrising per capita income, a differentiation of consumer demand for both goods and services creates new\nmarket niches and provides opportunities for business ownership. At the supply side of entrepreneurship,\nsocial psychology hypothesizes a hierarchy of human motivations, ranging from material needs to self-\nrealization (Maslow 1970). By providing autonomy, entrepreneurship may become a more attractive\noccupational choice at higher levels of income.\nHowever, this reversal is not universal, as witnessed by the continued decline of business ownership\nin some highly developed economies such as France and Japan (Verheul et al., 2002). Two opposing forces\nmay be at play here: while rising wage levels will continue to increase the opportunity costs of self-\nemployment, differentiation of consumer wants will create more opportunities for new enterprises.\nOccupational choices in countries with low uncertainty avoidance may be influenced more strongly by the\nlatter effect than by the first. In high uncertainty avoidance countries, it may be the other way around.\nConsequently, at advanced levels of economic development, we conjecture a differential impact of\nincreasing prosperity in low (UAI-) and in high (UAI+) uncertainty avoidance countries. In UAI+ countries,\nthe negative relationship between the level of prosperity and the self-employment rate will be undiminished\nacross economic development. In UAI- countries, the negative relationship between prosperity and the self-\nemployment rate will be weaker or even reverse after a certain turning point.\nShare of services\nAt the high end of economic development, the share of the services sector usually increases relative\nto that of manufacturing. On average, self-employment rates in services are considerably higher than in\nmanufacturing (see van Stel and Carree, 2004). It requires only relatively modest investments to set up an\nenterprise in many services. We assume that an increasing share of the services sector will increase the\nbusiness ownership rate.\nSo far, empirical research on this compositional effect on the business ownership rate is scant.\nWennekers and Folkeringa\u2019s (2002) investigation of long-term trends in the business ownership rate of the\nNetherlands showed that sector shifts clearly played a part, but within-sector trends turned out to be even\nmore important. For an analogous conclusion about trends in the firm size distribution of six large OECD\ncountries, see Loveman and Sengenberger (1991).\nRelative earnings of self-employment\nIn a previous section of the present paper we discussed a model of individual occupational choice.\nThis model assumes that relative earnings of self-employment versus wage-employment affect occupational\n9choice. Ceteris paribus, the better the prospects of entrepreneurial income as compared to the wage income\nof employees, the more people will be attracted to self-employment.6\nParker (2004: 68-70) presents a survey of the empirical evidence for this relationship. Various\ninvestigations using a structural probit model, including relative earnings as determinants of individual\noccupational choice, give mixed results. Two time-series studies at a more aggregate level, also cited by\nParker, find a significant contribution of aggregate earnings differentials to explaining trends in the UK self-\nemployment rate.\nIn our empirical analysis, we use the macro-economic labor income share as a (reverse) proxy for\nthe (expected) entrepreneurial income relative to the wage income. The labor income share is defined as the\nsum of wages including \u2018imputed wage income of self-employed persons\u2019, expressed as a fraction of total\nincome. This is admittedly a rough proxy.\nThe relationship between relative earnings and the business ownership rate may be moderated by the\ndegree of uncertainty avoidance. In an occupational choice perspective, the weighing of expected\nentrepreneurial and wage income against one another also includes an assessment of the risks involved. In\nUAI- countries, the entrepreneurial risks will be viewed more lightly and accordingly the effect of relative\nearnings may be stronger than in UAI+ countries.\nUnemployment\n(The threat of) unemployment is a factor diminishing the opportunity costs of self-employment,\nparticularly when unemployment benefits are low relative to (minimum or average) wages. However, when\nstructural unemployment is very high, this may indicate bleak business opportunities and discourage\nbusiness ownership (Hamilton, 1989 and Meager, 1992). Exactly where the negative influence of rising\nunemployment begins to outbalance the positive effect of decreasing opportunity costs depends on a\nperception of uncertain future events, and may therefore be related to the level of uncertainty avoidance in a\ncountry. Hence we expect the positive effects of unemployment to dominate in UAI- countries, and the\nnegative effects in UAI+ countries.\nSocial security entitlements\nHigh social security entitlements for employees contribute to the opportunity costs of\nentrepreneurship, and may be expected to have a negative influence on the business ownership rate. This has\nbeen confirmed in several empirical investigations (Ilmakunnas, Kanniainen and Lammi, 1999; Parker and\nRobson, 2004; Hessels, van Stel, Brouwer and Wennekers, 2006) reporting negative effects on self-\nemployment of employers\u2019 social security contributions and\/or the unemployment benefit replacement rate.\nIncome disparity\nSome scholars hypothesize that an equal income distribution may limit the required asset\naccumulation facilitating enterprise formation, while income disparity may be favorable to entrepreneurship\n(Ilmakunnas et al., 1999). At the lower end of the income distribution, inequality may act as a push factor to\nenter self-employment. Additionally, on the demand side of entrepreneurship, income disparity is likely to\ncreate a more differentiated demand for goods and services. Empirical research by Ilmakunnas et al.\nsuggests that income inequality positively influences the rate of self-employment, although reversed\ncausality cannot be ruled out.\nFinancial variables\nStarting and running a business requires financial capital. This capital is needed to purchase or rent\nthe premises, to invest in equipment and\/or vehicles, to purchase raw materials, to finance market research\nand advertising and to advance wages. The need for financial capital differs strongly with the line of\nbusiness. Financial resources for business start-ups are often derived from self-financing (including savings,\ngifts, inheritances and lottery wins). Additionally, informal investors, mortgage loans, commercial credit and\n6 In a micro-economic model of occupational choice (de Wit, 1993), equality of entrepreneurial income and wages determine the\nequilibrium number of self-employed. In this model, an exogenous wage increase lowers the (equilibrium) number of self-employed\nwhile an exogenous upward shift of profits raises the equilibrium.\n10\nbank loans and (very rarely) venture capital can also be a source of start-up capital (Bygrave and Hunt,\n2005).\nCapital constraints, often related to lack of assets or collateral, may create serious impediments for\nbusiness start-ups (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1998; Evans and Leighton, 1989; van Praag, 1996) and for\nyoung and growing firms (Chittenden, Hall and Hutchinson, 1996; LeCornu and McMahon, 1996). An\ninfluential paper by Evans and Jovanovic (1989) has stimulated research on credit rationing. For a survey of\nthis literature, see Parker (2004). While a clear conclusion on the prevalence of credit rationing seems yet\nout of reach, there is ample evidence that self-employment rates are positively related to personal wealth\n(real estate and other assets).\nFinally, the direct and indirect (opportunity) costs of financing a business depend on the rate of\ninterest. Higher interest rates may be expected to have a negative effect on business ownership. Parker\n(2004: 104, 105) weighs the empirical evidence. In particular, several UK and US time-series studies show a\nsignificant negative effect of the interest rate on the self-employment rate.\nDemographic characteristics\nWith respect to gender, in most surveys women are found to be less likely to be involved in either\nself-employment or early-stage entrepreneurial activity than are men, although the difference varies across\nnations (Minniti, Arenius and Langowitz, 2005; Verheul, 2005). Econometric analysis of a large Swedish\ndataset of individual business start-ups has shown a remaining 'pure' gender effect after correcting for other\ndifferences, such as education and previous management experience (Delmar and Davidsson, 2000). A\nhigher labor participation rate of women thus in itself means a lower overall business ownership rate in the\nlabor force.\nThe role of population density at the national level is less obvious. Every local area needs a\nminimum supply of facilities in retail trade, repair and personal services. Therefore, thinly populated regions\nwill have relatively many small retail outlets, workshops and service providers. Conversely, urban areas will\ngive rise to economies of scale through which small-sized entrepreneurship in particularly retailing comes\nunder pressure (Bais, van der Hoeven and Verhoeven, 1995). On the other hand, networks and other supply\nside factors in urban areas are conducive to new entrepreneurship in many service industries (Audretsch and\nKeilbach, 2004).\nEducation is somewhat of an anomaly. Research conducted on a Swedish sample at individual level,\nshowing that nascent entrepreneurs attained on average a higher educational level7 than those in a control\nsample (Delmar and Davidsson, 2000), has been reconfirmed in recent investigations across several high-\nincome countries (Acs, Arenius, Hay and Minniti, 2004). On the other hand, macroeconomic research with\nrespect to a static index of entrepreneurship suggests the opposite conclusion. For instance, Uhlaner, Thurik\nand Hutjes (2002) found that countries with a higher level of education tend to have a smaller proportion of\nself-employment. In a recent comparative study across 27 OECD countries, countries with a higher level of\nenrollment in secondary education show a lower level of early-stage entrepreneurship, while higher\nenrollment in tertiary education was found to have a positive effect on both early-stage entrepreneurship and\ntotal business ownership (Uhlaner and Thurik, 2007).\nWith respect to the age composition of the population, Blanchflower, Oswald and Stutzer (2001:\n686) report that, while 'older people are more likely to be self-employed, it is younger people who say they\nwould prefer to be self-employed'. Earlier research also shows that people in the middle age cohorts have the\nhighest prevalence of incumbent business owners (Storey, 1994). In many countries, prevalence rates of\nnascent entrepreneurship are highest in the age group between 25 and 34, while, according to some research,\na tendency towards start-ups at a younger age is also apparent.8 Ceteris paribus, the ageing of the population\nin most developed countries implies a threat to the future development of business ownership.\nMETHOD AND DATA\n7 In addition, nascent entrepreneurs were found to have more management experience.\n8 Delmar and Davidsson (2000), EIM\/EZ (2000), van Gelderen (1999:21) and various annual Executive Reports published by the\nGlobal Entrepreneurship Monitor.\n11\nMethod\nFirst, we investigate the direct influence of uncertainty avoidance on the business ownership rate by\nmeans of a regression analysis of pooled panel data for 21 countries in 1976, 1990 and 2004, given the\ninfluence of (four years lagged) per capita income and some other control variables (also four years lagged).\nThe control variables are chosen from table 2 on the basis of data-availability. We assume that the samples\nfor 1976, 1990 and 2004 are sufficiently independent to warrant pooling them in one regression. Because\nuncertainty avoidance was measured only once (around 1970), its role in the pooled regression analysis may\nbe interpreted as that of a country-specific time-invariant variable. Next, we use the years 1976, 1990 and\n2004 as separate samples to investigate the stability of the direct relationship over time.\nSecond, we explore the possible indirect influence of uncertainty avoidance on the rate of business\nownership. This means that we have added an interaction term between per capita income and uncertainty\navoidance to the multiple regression analysis of the pooled sample for 1976, 1990 and 2004. Finally, we\nrepeat this regression, substituting UAI by a dummy variable representing two separate clusters of countries.\nIn our dataset, the following thirteen countries form the cluster9 of low uncertainty avoidance: Denmark,\nFinland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland, USA, Canada,\nAustralia and New Zealand. Another eight countries, i.e. Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal,\nSpain and Japan, make up the cluster with high uncertainty avoidance. By comparing these two models we\nhope to find indications whether the effects of uncertainty avoidance are discrete or continuous (see also\nCohen and Cohen, 1983).\nData\nHarmonized non-agricultural business ownership rates for 23 OECD-countries are available from\nEIM\u2019s COMPENDIA data base.10 These data include the owners of incorporated and unincorporated\nbusinesses but exclude unpaid family workers. The countries in COMPENDIA include 18 European\ncountries as well as the USA, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Data are available for the even\nyears from 1972 onwards.\nAdditionally, Hofstede (2001) provides data on uncertainty avoidance for 21 of the 23 countries\nmentioned above.11 Uncertainty avoidance is a key variable in Hofstede\u2019s well-known study12 of cultural\ndimensions across some 50 different nations and regions. The uncertainty avoidance index (UAI) was\ncomputed on the basis of the country mean scores for three different survey questions already mentioned in\na previous section of the present paper. Because the surveys on which the index was based were held\nbetween 1967 and 1973, the stability of the index is a crucial aspect for our study into the rate of business\nownership in the years 1976, 1990 and 2004. Hofstede (2001: 34) claims that national cultures are extremely\nstable over time. He argues that \u2018\u2026 this stability can be explained from the reinforcement of culture\npatterns by the institutions that themselves are products of the dominant cultural value systems\u2019. In the long\nrun, \u2018cultures shift, but they shift in formation, so that the differences between them remain intact\u2019\n(Hofstede, 2001: 255). Chapters 2 and 4 of Hofstede\u2019s book present abundant statistical information about\nthe stability and reliability of the uncertainty avoidance index. Our best assessment is that this index can be\nused for explaining national rates of entrepreneurship during several decades following the measurement of\nthe index.\nAn alternative would have been to use the uncertainty avoidance data reported by the GLOBE\nproject (House et al., 2004). We refrain from doing so for two reasons. First, Hofstede\u2019s uncertainty\navoidance index is well understood, and has been used in many previous studies. Hofstede (2001) also\nreports extensively on correlates of his uncertainty avoidance index with measures from over one hundred\nother studies. Comparable validation of the GLOBE uncertainty avoidance scales is not available. Second,\nthere are some conceptual difficulties with the GLOBE uncertainty avoidance scales. GLOBE constructed\n9 The clustering was carried out with the K-means algorithm. See Noorderhaven et al. (1999).\n10 COMParative ENtrepreneurship Data for International Analysis. See van Stel (2005). In the current paper, data from\nCOMPENDIA version 2004.2 are used.\n11 No data on Hofstede\u2019s indices are available for Iceland, whereas for Luxembourg there are estimates that we have used for\nclustering only. See Noorderhaven et al. (1999).\n12 This study was first published in 1980, but the second edition, published in 2001, gives more information on stability and cross-\nvalidation of the data.\n12\ntwo scales, the actual use of uncertainty avoidance mechanism in the respondent\u2019s society (\u201cpractices\u201d), and\nthe desired use of uncertainty avoidance mechanisms (\u201cvalues\u201d). These two scales are negatively correlated.\nThe GLOBE practices scale is also negatively correlated to Hofstede\u2019s UAI scale, the GLOBE values scale\npositively (Sully de Luque and Javidan, 2004).13 This makes the GLOBE scales difficult to interpret. The\nauthors note that most countries with high uncertainty avoidance practices are technologically developed\nnations (Sully de Luque and Javidan, 2004: 621). This makes the index less relevant for the current study, as\nwe are comparing levels of business ownership across developed countries only. Both GLOBE uncertainty\navoidance scales are strongly correlated with economic prosperity, the \u201cpractices\u201d scale positively, and the\n\u201cvalues\u201d scale negatively (Sully de Luque and Javidan, 2004: 631). Hofstede\u2019s UAI, in contrast, is only\nweakly correlated to economic prosperity (Hofstede, 2001: 201). Consequently, Hofstede\u2019s index measures\ncultural characteristics of countries that are relatively independent of wealth, and thus this index forms a\ngood complement to the economic indicators we also use in this study.\nFor the operationalization and sources of the control variables, we refer to table 2. Besides the\ncontrols included in table 2, we also include year dummies in our analysis. Recent decades have witnessed a\nworldwide diffusion of new information and communication technologies, as well as a widespread tendency\ntowards deregulation of markets. Both phenomena have created opportunities for small scale business and\nnew entrepreneurship. Audretsch and Thurik (2000 and 2001) label this as a regime switch from \u2018a managed\nto an entrepreneurial economy\u2019. We try to catch these developments using year dummies as controls in our\nanalysis.\nTable 3 presents the correlation matrix of the pooled sample for 1976, 1990 and 2004. The highest\n(positive) correlations among the control variables include those between per capita income, on the one\nhand, and the female labor share and tertiary education, on the other. Uncertainty avoidance and per capita\nincome show a moderate degree of (negative) correlation in our sample.\nINSERT TABLE 3\nRESULTS\nDirect influence of uncertainty avoidance\nTable 4 presents the regressions on the pooled sample for 21 countries in 1976, 1990 and 2004.\nFirst, we regress business ownership on uncertainty avoidance, GDP per capita and the year dummy\nvariables. This is the \u2018base model\u2019, shown in the first column of the table. The significantly positive\ncoefficient for uncertainty avoidance is support for Baum\u2019s hypothesis, stating that dissatisfaction with a\nclimate of high uncertainty avoidance in large organizations may push enterprising individuals towards self-\nemployment. GDP per capita and the year dummies are also significant and have the expected sign. Next, we\nintroduce the other control variables one by one. In all but one of these regressions, the coefficient for\nuncertainty avoidance is significantly positive. The only exception is the regression including the Gini\nindex, which is based on 37 observations only. With respect to the significant control variables, the only\ncounterintuitive result is the positive sign for the long term interest rate. Subsequently, as shown in the\nsecond to last column of table 4, we regress business ownership on uncertainty avoidance while including\nall control variables that are significant in the previous regressions14. Finally, the last column shows the\nvariables that are significant in a \u2018complete model\u2019. These are uncertainty avoidance (+), per capita income\n(-), the share of services (+), the unemployment replacement rate (-) and the dummy variables for 1990 and\n2004 (+).\n13 For the 19 countries in our dataset for which we have both Hofstede and GLOBE data on uncertainty avoidance, the correlations\nare: Hofstede UAI x GLOBE practices: -.643; Hofstede UAI x GLOBE values: .607; GLOBE practices x GLOBE values: -.869. All\nthese correlations are significant at the 1% level.\n14 Excluding the Gini coefficient and the long term interest rate, due to the smaller available number of observations of these\nvariables.\n13\nINSERT TABLE 4\nTable 5 presents the regressions in three separate sample years 1976, 1990 and 2004. For each year,\nthe left-hand column presents a regression including the control variables that were listed in the second to\nlast column of table 4, while the right-hand column reports significant control variables only. The main\nfinding for the sample of 1976 is a significantly positive influence of uncertainty avoidance on the rate of\nbusiness ownership. In 1990, the coefficient of uncertainty avoidance is again positive, but no longer fully\nsignificant. In 2004, no influence of UAI is found. All regressions confirm the well-known negative\ninfluence of GDP per capita.\nINSERT TABLE 5\nThe main outcome of table 5 is that the positive effect of uncertainty avoidance fades away over\ntime. Our interpretation is that the advent of the entrepreneurial economy in recent years, as discussed in our\nIntroduction, has created new pull factors mobilizing the relatively abundant supply of potential\nentrepreneurial capital in countries with low uncertainty avoidance. So Baum\u2019s push hypothesis for high\nuncertainty avoidance and Shane\u2019s pull hypothesis for low uncertainty avoidance may now be equally valid,\neffectively countervailing one another in the regression for 2004. Another explanation could be that the\nmeasurement of uncertainty avoidance (which was carried out around 1970) has lost some of its validity 30\nyears onwards, but the arguments discussed in the Data section offer no specific support for this\ninterpretation. The coefficients for GDP per capita and to a lesser extent for the share of services and the\nreplacement rate are relatively stable over time. The two other control variables, i.e. the female labor share\nand the share of the age group 25-39, are only significant for 2004. These results are consistent with the\nfindings in the last two columns of table 4.\nWe conclude that there is evidence for a push effect of high uncertainty avoidance on the rate of\nbusiness ownership. However, in recent years, a pull towards entrepreneurship in a climate of low\nuncertainty avoidance may have gained dominance vis-\u00e0-vis this longstanding historical push effect of high\nuncertainty avoidance. We have also found consistent confirmation of the well-known observation of a\nnegative bearing of per capita income on business ownership. Finally, most results support a positive\ninfluence of the share of services and a negative effect of the replacement rate.\nIndirect influence of uncertainty avoidance\nNext, we explore the possible indirect influence of uncertainty avoidance on the rate of business\nownership, by adding an interaction term between per capita income and uncertainty avoidance to the\npooled panel regressions. The two left-hand columns of table 6 compare the results of the base model\nincluding this interaction term in addition to uncertainty avoidance, GDP per capita and the year dummy\nvariables with the original base model as presented in table 4. The main outcome is a significant (at 10%\nlevel) intermediate effect of uncertainty avoidance on the influence of GDP per capita.15 What do these\nresults mean in a quantitative sense? As an illustration, the results imply that for the country with the highest\nUAI-rate in the sample (Greece), an increase in real per capita income with $ 1.000 would imply a decrease\nof the business ownership rate with 0.61 percentage points, while for the country with the lowest uncertainty\navoidance rate (Denmark), this increase in income would mean a decline in business ownership with 0.14\npercentage points only. These differences show that the indirect effect exists indeed.\nINSERT TABLE 6\nThe right-hand columns of table 6 present regressions in which uncertainty avoidance has been\nsubstituted by a dummy variable representing a high and a low uncertainty avoidance cluster of countries, as\n15 This appears both from the significance level of the interaction term (p-value is .078) and from a loglikelihood test comparing the\nmodels in the first two columns of table 6. The LR test statistic is 3.4 while the 10% critical value is 2.71.\n14\nexplained in the section on Method and Data. The results are similar to those including the continuous scale\nfor UAI, as discussed in the previous paragraph. Again, the model including both a direct and an indirect\neffect of uncertainty avoidance outperforms the model including a direct effect only (at 10% level). An\nincrease in real per capita income with $ 1.000 implies a decrease of the business ownership rate with 0.59\npercentage points in the UAI+ countries and a decline with 0.28 percentage points in the UAI- countries.\nNext, we test the robustness of the indirect effect by adding the share of services and the\nreplacement rate as control variables. Table 7 reports the results. As can be seen from columns 2 and 4, the\nindirect effect then becomes somewhat smaller and is no longer fully significant.\nINSERT TABLE 7\nBy and large, there are serious indications of a differential effect of per capita income on\nentrepreneurship across the rate of uncertainty avoidance, but the robustness of these results is limited. A\nfinal observation on the basis of tables 6 and 7 is that the statistical fit of a \u2018discrete effect\u2019 of uncertainty\navoidance is not significantly better than that of a \u2018continuous effect\u2019.16\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe prevalence of entrepreneurship, expressed as the percentage of business owners in the labor\nforce, differs strongly between countries. The causes of this disparity do not only have an economic basis,\nbut also stem from cultural differences between countries (Hofstede et al., 2004 and Noorderhaven et al.,\n1999). The persistence of the country differences throughout the economic cycles points at cultural\ndeterminants, which are relatively constant per country.\nUsing a pooled dataset of a large number of OECD countries in 1976, 1990 and 2004, we have\nfound a positive direct influence of uncertainty avoidance on business ownership rates, indicating that, in\nthose years, a climate of high uncertainty avoidance in existing firms and organizations may push\nenterprising individuals towards self-employment (Baum\u2019s hypothesis, as discussed before). These findings\nalso show that a personal trait (risk aversion) and its cultural counterpart (uncertainty avoidance) may have a\ndiverging impact on entrepreneurship. Repeating these regressions in three separate sample years confirms\nthese results for 1976 and 1990. However, for the year 2004, the main outcome is that uncertainty avoidance\nno longer has any direct influence on business ownership. Our interpretation is that the advent of the\nentrepreneurial economy in recent years has created pull factors mobilizing the relatively abundant supply of\npotential entrepreneurial capital in countries with low uncertainty avoidance. In recent years, a pull towards\nentrepreneurship in a climate of low uncertainty avoidance has gained dominance vis-\u00e0-vis a longstanding\nhistorical push effect of high uncertainty avoidance.\nWe also found evidence for a negative indirect influence of uncertainty avoidance through a\nmoderating effect on the influence of per capita income on business ownership. In low uncertainty\navoidance countries, the negative influence of per capita income on the rate of business ownership is clearly\nsmaller than in high uncertainty avoidance countries. In a group of eight high-uncertainty avoidance\ncountries, a relatively strong negative relationship between GDP per capita and the level of business\nownership suggests that rising opportunity costs of entrepreneurship are the dominant perception in this\ncultural environment. On the other hand, in a group of thirteen low-uncertainty avoidance countries, the\nrelatively weak negative relationship between business ownership and per capita income suggests that rising\nopportunities are a countervailing force in an environment of low uncertainty avoidance.\nA closer look at the underlying development of the business ownership rate in all 21 countries\nbetween 1972 and 2004 reveals the following. In the group of low-uncertainty avoidance countries, eight out\nof thirteen nations show either a clear U-shape (Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and New Zealand) or a\nvaguely U-shape trend (Australia, Great Britain, Sweden and USA), three show a continuously upward trend\nin entrepreneurship (Canada, Ireland and Switzerland), one shows a stabilization in the last twenty years\n16 Note that, in table 6, the R2 of the continuous effect model is (slightly) higher compared to the discrete effect model while in table\n7, this is the other way around.\n15\n(Denmark), while only one (Norway) shows a decreasing trend.17 In the group of high-uncertainty avoidance\ncountries, two out of eight countries (France and Japan)18 show a strongly decreasing trend, while six show\nan increase or a U-shape, sometimes followed by stabilization. While the large number of countries with\nrising business ownership rates across both groups bear witness to a worldwide trend toward more\nentrepreneurship related to ICT and deregulation, the differential indirect effects of uncertainty avoidance\nalso suggest that, in modern service economies, high uncertainty avoidance may indirectly have a negative\nimpact on the development of business ownership and may hamper the exploitation of new economic\nopportunities.\nOur study has some limitations that should be borne in mind when interpreting the results. First, the\nmodest explanatory power of most of our regressions suggests that other cultural and psycho-sociological\nvariables may also play a role19. Second, our paper only studies the effect of uncertainty avoidance on the\nlevel of entrepreneurship. It would be relevant to repeat the study for the dynamics of entrepreneurship,\nalthough a lack of time series of harmonized business start-up data across countries may hamper the latter at\nleast in the near future. Finally, business ownership rates are available for a far smaller number of countries\nthan uncertainty avoidance data. This inhibits fuller testing of the direct and the indirect effect of uncertainty\navoidance.\nNonetheless, the present results may already have some relevance for policymakers trying to\npromote entrepreneurship. While we would not advocate social engineering, the results do suggest that\ncountries should investigate to what extent their educational system and relevant labor market, social and\nfiscal legislation foster a low or a high degree of uncertainty avoidance within the population.\nREFERENCES\nAcs, Z.J., B.
