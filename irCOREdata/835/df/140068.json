Specifically, contributions from resource-based theory, dynamic capabilities,\ncorporate strategy and Mintzberg\u2019s structure theory have been combined to derive four\ncongruent resource-creating strategies: financial control, scale, leverage, and creativity.\nMintzberg\u2019s configurations approach is used to explore the organisational structures and\nprocesses associated with each strategy. It argues that choices with respect to corporate\nresource creation must be made as these four strategies require distinct, congruent\norganisational arrangements. When congruent strategies deliver diminishing returns,\ndivergent strategies may be pursued. However, there is a risk of incoherence where a\ndivergent strategy is poorly implemented.\n3Congruent, Divergent and Incoherent Corporate Level Strategies\nThe resource-based view1 provides insight into the stock of value creating resources inside\nthe firm. More recently, this literature has been augmented by contributions which focus on\nthe processes of resource creation, termed dynamic capabilities2. Typically these arguments\nare addressing firm or strategic business unit level strategy, as the value of resources is\ndiscussed in terms of their contribution to the achievement of competitive advantage. But\nthese theoretical developments offer us an opportunity to re-visit corporate level strategy. In\nwhat follows we draw on insights from the resource based view, dynamic capabilities, the\ncorporate strategy literature3 and the notion of configurations to develop four coherent\ncorporate resource creating strategies. They are coherent in two respects. First, the structures\nand processes associated with their implementation are internally supportive, and second\ncorporate level and SBU level strategy are aligned.\nWe then argue that at some point in the development of the corporation a particular congruent\nconfiguration will exhaust its value creating potential. This leads us to speculate on the\npossibility of divergent strategies where there are fundamental differences of strategic\norientation at corporate and SBU level. We then explore the implications for leadership if\nsuccessful divergent strategies are to be implemented.\nFour Congruent Configurations\nDrawing on recent contributions to the resource based view, particularly the notion of\ndynamic capabilities we can suggest that there are four distinct modes of corporate value\ncreation. Each of these modes exploits particular dynamic capabilities to create new corporate\nvalue creating resources, which may be located within the SBUs or they may be at the\n4corporate centre. Three higher level capabilities identified by Teece et al, (reconfiguration,\nreplication and learning) have informed an exploration of the organisational consequences of\nenacting these capabilities.\n1) Financial Control: here the centre causes SBU resources to be developed\nthrough the setting and administering of tough financial controls. Appropriate\ncapabilities include SBU acquisition and resource allocation routines,\naccompanied by a process of provoked learning within SBUs.\n2) Scale: the centre delivers the resource by reconfiguring support activities\nand\/or core processes to exploit economies of scale.\n3) Leverage: the centre creates new SBU resources through replication, by\ncodifying and transferring know-how that originates from the centre, or from\nSBUs.\n4) Creativity: the centre encourages and facilitates learning that leads to product\nor process innovation. Here the centre is aiming to set up \u201cwebs of\ncollaboration\u201d across the corporation.\nThese can be viewed as alternative corporate strategies, and each one is likely to call for a\nparticular combination of organisational structures and processes. Mintzberg\u2019s4 notion of\nconfigurations can help us draw out the organisational implications of theses differing\ncorporate value creation strategies. Mintzberg argues that there are congruent combinations\nof structures, and processes that match particular sets of contingent conditions. Five of the\n5six commonly occurring configurations he describes can be regarded as essentially firm-level\nphenomena (the entrepreneurial, machine, professional, missionary and adhocratic\nconfigurations). The multidivisional structure is his sixth configuration, which we are\nattempting to elaborate here by exploring the structural and process implications of these\ndifferent corporate level strategies.\nDrawing on the concept of configurations, we can identify the differing design parameters\nthat are likely to be associated with each of these corporate strategies. The resulting\nalignment of strategic intent and organisational structures and processes we label a congruent\ncorporate strategy.\nThe idea of congruent configurations can be traced back to the early empirical studies of\norganisations conducted by, for example Chandler, Burns & Stalker and Lawrence &\nLorsch5. Miles & Snow6 and Mintzberg have developed the approach, and in the strategy\nfield Porter7 could also be seen to be pursuing a configurational argument.\nThe reason for adopting this approach here is rooted in a belief that strategy and structure\nshould not be treated as separate phenomena. A strategy will have distinct and particular\norganisational requirements if it is to be realised. So realised strategies and structures are\ninextricably connected. Organisational structures and processes should be regarded as partial\ndescriptions of realised strategy, or, to put it another way, intended strategy is enacted\nthrough extant structures and processes. Therefore, although intended strategies8 can exist in\nan ideal form, realised strategies cannot. With intended strategies we can detect likely\nmismatches between strategy and structure, but with realised strategies structures and\nprocesses become part of the description of strategy. If we are able to establish feasible links\n6between our four strategies and organisational structures and processes, this lends weight to\nthe argument that the strategies are not merely ideal constructs.\nInsert Table 1 about here\nIn Table 1 we have suggested that each strategy requires distinct combinations of design\nparameters. We have adapted Mintzberg\u2019s original set of parameters, and have focused on\nthose most likely to vary by corporate strategy. These are:\n\uf0b7 SBU strategy autonomy\n\uf0b7 SBU performance measures\n\uf0b7 Co-ordination across levels (between the centre and SBUs)\n\uf0b7 Co-ordination across SBUs.\nTable 1 also explains the role of the centre in each strategy, the location of \u201cresources\u201d, and\nthe requirement for SBU similarity if the strategy is going to add value. It also suggests\nwhich dynamic capabilities are likely to be in evidence. Moreover, there are some parallels\nbetween each strategy and Mintzberg\u2019s original work, because each strategy can be\nassociated with a predominant co-ordination mechanism, and a predominant part of the\norganisation. Figure 1 depicts each strategy with adaptations of Mintzberg\u2019s original \u2018logo\u2019.\nWe can now explore the required configurations for each resource creating strategy in more\ndepth, starting with the financial control strategy.\nInsert Figure 1 about here\n7Financial Control\nA familiar strategy adopted by diversified conglomerates, the financial control strategy\ncreates SBU resources through a tough governance regime. The setting of stretching targets\nprovokes learning in the SBUs, which have autonomy over means, or strategy, but not ends.\nCo-ordination between the centre and the SBUs is minimal, as is co-ordination across the\ndisparate collection of SBUs in the portfolio. The prime co-ordination process is the\nstandardisation of financial outputs. The key part of the organisation is the strategic apex that\nsets the targets, and changes the mix of SBUs. Critical is the application of managerial skills,\nwhich are transactionally focused on detail and require disciplined application from both\nCentre and SBU managers. The relentless nature of continuous attention to the numbers\nrequires an uncompromising sense of diligence.\nHence classic examples of financial control groups were diversified conglomerates such as\nHanson, Tomkins, and the old forms of BAT Industries and GEC (now renamed Marconi).\nLess diverse groups such as Saatchi & Saatchi and WPP have applied the rules of this\nconfiguration in their initial rapid growth strategies.\nScale\nHere reconfiguration of core or support activity results in resource creation at the centre. If\nsupport functions are consolidated to achieve cost reductions there is no strong requirement\nfor SBU strategies to be strongly co-ordinated. However, where SBU activities are closely\ncoupled to centralised core processes then strong co-ordination is required between the\ncentralised activities and the remaining sub-set of activities that are conducted in SBUs. For\nexample, the SBUs may be restricted to geographically distributed sales and service activity,\nhaving to rely on centralised manufacturing processes. At the centre, co-ordination is effected\n8through direct supervision of support and\/or core activities to ensure the achievement of scale\nadvantages. The centralised operating core and the line management who control it are the\nkey parts of the structure. The style of management adopted is hierarchical (top down) and at\ntimes, blatantly so, in order to highlight the philosophy of centralisation. In circumstances of\nresistance confrontational rather than co-operative approaches to conflict resolution are likely\nto be more effective.\nThis configuration is utilised by several industries which have undergone, or are still in the\nprocess of, major consolidations in order to reduce costs or gain critical mass for key business\nprocesses (e.g. automotive manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and financial services).\nLeverage\nIn the leverage strategy the centre\u2019s role is to replicate knowledge-based resources across the\nmix of SBUs. Thus the centre is required to identify, codify and transfer know-how. SBUs\nhave some strategy autonomy, but they would be required to adopt standardised systems, and\nto co-operate with other SBUs in the replication process. Thus Mintzberg\u2019s technostructure,\nthose staff at the centre engaging in the replication processes, are the key part of the\norganisation. Leadership rather than good management is required, as promoting knowledge\nreplication will involve attention to contextual factors. Although the centre challenging the\n\u2018moves\u2019 of each SBU in the organisation would be received as unwelcome, the unique nature\nof each unit is likely to make the pursuit of managerial templates unlikely.\nBusinesses which are trying to replicate specific skills from one area or SBU are utilising the\nleverage configuration. Several fast moving consumer goods groups (such as Unilever,\nProcter and Gamble, Nestle and Philip Morris) and the Disney group have sought to leverage\n9their brand management and customer service expertise across a wider range of products and\nsectors. For instance, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s acquisition of Rowntrees has led to a dramatic development\nand extension of core confectionery brands like Kit Kat and Polo.\nCreativity\nHere learning within SBUs is encouraged and supported by the centre, but in addition the\ncentre engenders cross-SBU dialogue. The key part of the organisation is the culture, or\nideology. Values of collaboration, and sharing information and ideas in the corporate interest\nare critical. SBUs should have complementary knowledge and experience sets that can spark\noff each other to create new ideas. These may be profitably developed within existing SBUs,\nor indeed new SBUs may need to be established to exploit the new resource. Similar to the\nleverage strategy, new and further learning is likely to be achieved through leadership by\nexample, thus promoting a climate of open dialogue and challenge. Senior management need\nto live the corporate philosophy of creativity and dynamism by making themselves available\nfor feedback and exhibiting a robustness for the \u2018cut and thrust\u2019 of ideas exchange.\nCreative configuration groups include 3M, Canon and Cisco where maintaining the culture of\nthe organisation is seen as the critical role of the centre. Interestingly, but not surprisingly,\nthis configuration becomes even more challenging as the business succeeds and grows. This\nis particularly true where this success is based on a single product range (e.g. Microsoft and\nIntel), and the business may, by default, migrate to the leverage configuration with a greater\ndegree of direct intervention from the centre. The company may need a significant\nrestructuring if it desires to move back to its original creative configuration, so as to maintain\nits original winning culture and value system.\n10\nIncoherent Strategies\nAs is clear if one reads across the rows of Table 1, each strategy is distinct in the\norganisational structures and systems it requires. This may suggest that where there is clarity\nconcerning the corporate value adding strategy, the corresponding congruence of the design\nparameters may be associated with good performance. Conversely mismatches between the\nespoused corporate strategy and the design parameters may lead to poor results. Moreover,\nwhere corporate management strive to achieve the benefits of more than one value adding\nstrategy the relevant design parameters may be compromised, resulting in an incoherent\nstrategy. Thus one key conclusion from this configuration argument would be that corporate\nexecutives need to be very clear on the predominant resource creation strategy they are\npursuing. This is because the realisation of the selected strategy requires a particular set of\norganisational arrangements, and failure to align corporate processes according to the\ndemands of each strategy is likely to be sub-optimal. Similarly, attempts to pursue two\nresource-creation strategies simultaneously may well result in disappointment, as in the\nabsence of appropriate structures and processes, further resource development is likely to be\nconstrained.\nHowever, scrutiny of the table suggests that some strategies may co-exist without too much\nconflict between the required design parameters. For example, one might envisage a\ncorporation pursuing leverage and creative strategies simultaneously without undue conflict\nbetween the parameters: both require the centre to establish a culture of co-operation across\nlevels and between SBUs, where SBU goals would reflect both financial and non-financial\nperformance, and both require some complementarity across the mix of SBUs.\n11\nWe might envisage conflicts where the espoused strategy is creativity, but the pressures\nexperienced by SBU management may well be those associated with a financial control\nstrategy. Similarly, where SBU autonomy is severely constrained by the requirement to use\ncorporate resources, as in the extreme scale style of configuration where core processes have\nbeen centralised, setting tough bottom line targets to SBU management which are more suited\nto the financial control style may be extremely de-motivating. In Figure 2 we have positioned\nthe four strategies according to the extent of SBU strategy autonomy they permit, required\nSBU similarity, and the co-ordination requirements. We have located two versions of the\nscale strategy: Scale 1 refers to the consolidation of support functions, and Scale 2 refers to\nthe achievement of scale economies in core processes.\nThis mapping of the strategies on these dimensions suggests where the tensions between\nstrategies might primarily stem from. Where strategies are adjacent in Figure 2, we could\nconclude that they might be pursued concurrently without exerting undue tensions and\nconflicting demands on the organisation\u2019s structures and processes. The corporate executives\ncould therefore direct attention to minimising the effects of these design parameter\ncompromises.\nInsert Figure 2 about here\nSustainability of Corporate Strategies\nAdopting an RBV, and specifically a dynamic capabilities approach to corporate strategy\nenables us to explore the nature and durability of some sources of corporate advantage. We\nmight suppose that these sources of advantage would vary in the extent to which they can be\nreplicated. It would seem that certain corporate capabilities are more susceptible to imitation\nthan others. For instance, we might expect that the consolidation of generic activities to\n12\nreduce certain overhead costs (as in the Scale 1 strategy), might be readily replicable by rival\ncorporations. But when we consider the leverage strategy, the capability to identify a\nknowledge resource, to codify it, to identify where else it may give advantage, and to create\nthe climate that facilitates the embedding of this know-how in other SBUs, we might\nconclude that this capability may be very difficult to replicate.\nSimilarly, the ability to foster the climate of trust, required in the creative configuration, one\nwhere staff from different SBUs would feel free to collaborate, and where the pervading\nculture supports innovation and countenances \u201cfailure\u201d may be corporate advantages that are\nvery difficult to copy.\nThe sustainability of corporate advantage is likely to depend on both the quality of strategy\nexecution, and the ease with which the strategy can be imitated. As argued earlier one critical\ndimension of execution is the alignment or congruence of the design parameters set out in\nTable 1, with the espoused strategy. The key parameters as set out in Figure 2 are likely to be\nSBU autonomy, performance measures, and co-ordination across levels, and across SBUs. A\nlack of coherence is likely to lead to a reduction in the effective delivery of the espoused\nstrategy.\nThe ease with which the strategy can be imitated will be determined by the same variables\nthat prevent resources from being imitated e.g. social complexity, embeddedness,\ncodifiability, path dependency etc. We might expect that some of these strategies are\ninherently more imitable than others. Table 1 orders the strategies in this way, the control\nstrategy is assumed to be the easiest to replicate elsewhere, the creative strategy being the\nmost difficult. However, to suggest that the control regime may be the easiest to replicate\n13\nmay be correct in general terms, but this would not preclude a corporation from enacting this\nstrategy in a highly specific, non-imitable way. But the main thrust of this argument is that\nthe strategies to the left of Table 1 are generally more understandable, and their\nimplementation is more straightforward than those to the right of the table.\nOne of the four strategies is likely to be inherently more constrained than the others. This is\nthe scale strategy, because this strategy produces finite resources in the form of centrally\nmanaged processes. In contrast, the control, leverage and creativity strategies may be\nextendable across a wide range of SBUs. Many disparate businesses could benefit from a\ntough financial control regime, procurement skills could be leveraged across a wide variety of\nfirms, and differing combinations of complementary SBUs can be brought into creative\ndialogue.\nHowever, we would expect that at some point a particular congruent strategy would produce\ndiminishing returns. For instance, scale resources are exhausted as the minimum efficient\nscale is achieved, or opportunities to leverage established resources into other SBUs have\nbeen fully exploited. Or there could be few further gains to be had from a control regime, or\nknow-how advantages have been fully realised or the creative benefits from combining\ndifferent knowledge and experience across the SBUs have been played out. Once these\ndiminishing returns to a strategy have set in what can the centre do to rejuvenate the\ncorporate resource creation process?\nThe corporate centre could try to significantly change the composition of the SBUs\ncomprising the group. Divesting any divisions which are no longer enjoying a value\nenhancing relationship with the centre, and acquiring appropriate new businesses which can\n14\nbenefit as part of the existing corporate configuration, may rejuvenate the corporate resource\ncreation process.\nHowever, this reapplication of the existing congruent strategy works well for only two of our\ncorporate configurations. The control configuration and the scale 1 configuration (where\nsupport activities have been centralised) can rotate their portfolios of SBUs and continue to\ncreate value because their corporate centres already require acquisition dynamic capabilities\n(as shown in Table 1). Also, individual SBUs within these configurations have a relatively\nlow level of integration within the group and minimal co-ordination is required across the\nSBUs in such groups. This makes it much easier to unbundle any particular SBU from the\nbusinesses remaining within the group. The realisable value of the divested businesses is\nlikely to be closer to its full economic value due to the emphasis in both these configurations\u2019\nperformance measures on the individual SBUs stand-alone profitability.\nThe increased levels of co-ordination and integration in the other configurations make it more\ndifficult both to divest existing SBUs for full value and to regularly add significant acquired\nSBUs, as opposed to developing new SBUs organically within the group. At this point there\nis little further benefit to be had from the continuation of the congruent strategy. This is\nwhere the possibility of \u201cdivergent\u201d strategies emerges.\nDivergent Strategies\nIn a divergent strategy the centre pursues a value adding strategy that appears to be at odds\nwith the embedded strategy pursued within the SBUs. For example, if the SBUs have been\npursuing creative strategies that have run their course, the centre changes its focus to try to\nachieve scale or financial control advantages. Similarly, where cost advantages have been\n15\nfully exploited, the centre shifts attention and focus to the encouragement of know-how\ncreation.\nThese alternatives are diagrammatically represented in Figure 3. The vertical axis of Figure 3\ndistinguishes where changes in the focus of the corporate centre take place. Thus, the\ncorporate centre could change its focus from Creativity to Financial Control because it\nbelieved that the value creation potential of its original configuration was fully played out.\nThe horizontal axis considers whether the composition of the SBUs within the group has\nchanged. This juxtaposition suggests four possibilities, ranging from \u201cno change\u201d with the\ninevitability of diminishing returns in the long term, to \u201call change\u201d with the probable result\nof great confusion within the group. The divergent corporate strategy means that the\ncorporate centre is challenging the SBUs in a very different way. This could be achieved\nsimply by changing the performance measures used within the group. For example, in a\ngroup that had been implementing a creative configuration strategy, the SBU performance\nmeasures would emphasise the adherence to corporate values, the degree of collaboration on\nnew cross-divisional ventures and the sharing of complementary knowledge with other SBUs\nand the centre. A divergent corporate strategy could be introduced by changing to\nperformance measures that emphasised the profitability of individual SBUs.\nInsert Figure 3 about here\nThis change would probably result in a rapid movement towards internal transfer pricing and\nroyalty agreements for any shared knowledge or collaborative ventures, together with a much\nharder financial evaluation of any cross-divisional initiatives, and rigorous questioning of the\nreal value added by adhering to the corporate \u2018values\u2019. In some creative groups, where a lack\n16\nof financial rigour and challenge has resulted in wasteful expenditures, such a divergent\ncorporate strategy may initially create substantial added value. However, the sustainability of\nthis type of divergent strategy can be questioned, as can the current corporate centre\u2019s\ncapabilities to implement this type of change successfully.\nA potentially more sustainable divergent strategy can be where the group has been\nimplementing a very tough financial control regime across its range of SBUs. The emphasis\non financial performance of individual SBUs normally results in a limited degree of\nintegration among the SBUs and, for this type of corporate configuration, this is not a\nproblem. However if this corporate strategy is now reaping diminishing returns so that\nindividual SBU performance cannot be significantly further improved, the corporate centre\nmay wish to implement a divergent corporate strategy.\nThis could take the form of seeking to leverage existing resources more widely across the\ngroup. Thus the centre now needs the dynamic capabilities of replication and transferring,\nwhich involve identifying which existing resources have a wider potential application and\nthen codifying these into explicit knowledge so that they can be shared among the other\nrelevant SBUs. As with the previous example this transformation requires both that the\ncorporate centre changes its dynamic capabilities quite significantly as well as altering the\nperformance measures used within the group. However the resulting strategy, if successfully\nimplemented, is much more sustainable. Clearly, a constraint on the possibilities for\nleveraging know-how here is the diversity of the SBUs. Some rationalisation and re-grouping\nmay be required to avoid the imposition of inappropriate systems onto some SBUs where\nthese add no value.\n17\nIt is therefore not surprising that divergent corporate strategies often coincide with a change\nin the top management at the corporate centre, although there are examples of these divergent\nstrategies being implemented by existing management teams. The marketing services group,\nWPP, would appear relatively recently to have migrated away from its original financial\ncontrols configuration to the more integrated, but also more value adding, leverage\nconfiguration. The challenge for the corporate centre is to maintain a positive creative\ntension between itself and the SBUs during this dramatic change, rather than allowing the\nsituation to degenerate into value destroying confusion as SBU managers struggle to cope\nwith the new roles and expectations within the group.\nThe most dramatic opportunity for major confusion in a group can be achieved by changing\nboth dimensions of Figure 3 at the same time. In other words, the corporate centre changes\nits configuration at the same time as it radically changes the composition of the group. This\nwould appear to be at the heart of the recent problems of Marconi (GEC as was), and to have\ncontributed to the corporate problems at both BT and ICI. However, changing both\ndimensions could work, if the group acquires businesses for which its new corporate\nconfiguration should be relevant and value adding. In practice neither the corporate centre\nnor the SBUs (and certainly not the shareholders and other stakeholders in the group) now\nhave any clear frames of reference or relevant experience to rely on; consequently the top\nright hand box of Figure 3 tends to result in an intolerable level of confusion across the group\nwith a consequent destruction of shareholder value.\nInsert Figure 4 about here\n18\nThe challenges of these creative tension strategies are great, and they are unlikely to flourish\nunless a congruent strategy has been played out. This is because the individual SBUs within\nthe group need to have a strongly embedded strategy orientation, so that the new conflicting\norientation can play off against this established momentum. In the absence of this embedded\nstability the pursuit of divergent strategies would just cause confusion, and result in the\ndestruction of shareholder value.\nThis is diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 4 where the long term diminishing returns from\nany single corporate configuration are shown as the flattening curve of shareholder value\ncreation over time. As the curve flattens, the possibility of a change in the focus of the\ncorporate centre becomes more attractive. However, it is critical for the continued creation of\nshareholder value that the change in focus is to a value adding divergent strategy rather than\nto a value destroying incoherent strategy, under which confusion is generated by the\nexcessive disruption caused by changing both the corporate centre configuration and the\ncomposition of the group at the same time.\nConclusion\nWe have set out an approach to corporate level strategy derived from the recent developments\nin RBV, notably the notion of dynamic capabilities. Three higher level capabilities identified\nby Teece et al, (reconfiguration, replication and learning) have informed our exploration of\ncongruent resource creating strategies. Corporations can create resources, through\nreconfiguration, by consolidating support activities, and by centralising core processes to\nachieve scale advantages. New resources can be created at SBU level where existing know-\nhow is replicated, which we have referred to as the leverage strategy. SBU-level learning can\n19\nbe encouraged by the corporate centre, as in the creativity strategy, or it can be provoked by\nthe financial control strategy.\nThrough an exploration of the likely organisational requirements of each strategy, and\ndrawing on Mintzberg\u2019s configurational approach, we concluded that some of these strategies\ncould feasibly be pursued in tandem, but other combinations were not feasible. Pursuing any\ncongruent strategy vigorously will eventually result in a slowing of the resource creation\nprocess. We suggested that corporations could explore divergent strategies which would seek\nto develop resources in different ways to the embedded congruent strategy. Finally, using\nstandard RBV reasoning, we explored the sustainability of each strategy. The next challenge\nis to empirically explore these ideas. This could be done through an examination of extant\ncases of corporations, or through the gathering of fresh data.\n20\nREFERENCES\n1 Barney, J.B.
