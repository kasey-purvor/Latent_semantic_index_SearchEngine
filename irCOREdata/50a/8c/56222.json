The piece makes many\ntelling points concerning the role that various spatial practices have played\nin the production of a distinct modernity characterised by abstract space.\nThe exemplar in producing and promoting the consolidation of this abstract\nspace, which destroys both individual and social difference, is, according to\nSmith, the architect and town-planner Le Corbusier. Lefebvre is introduced\nby Smith in order to both consolidate the critique of Le Corbusier and provide\nthe basis for the development of a \u2018difference ethics\u2019. However, in building his\ncase, Smith brings forth a characterisation of Le Corbusier which many will\nfind tendentious and unjustified. The article also articulates a partial view\nof Lefebvre\u2019s attitude towards Le Corbusier. More worryingly, Smith, on\noccasion, questionably stretches the limits of textual interpretation in order\nto build his case, especially against Le Corbusier. Underlying these aspects\nis a disquieting lack of contextualisation and it is this that I wish to address\nfirst.\nContextual issues\nBoth Le Corbusier (1887-1965) and Henri Lefebvre (1901-1991) lived long and\nproductive lives each marked by prodigious published output. Yet Smith\u2019s\narticle contains little sense of which Lefebvre and which Le Corbusier is being\ndiscussed. There is no notion of any development of each\u2019s ideas over time or\nof ambiguity, contradiction or self-critique. The article also presents a confus-\ning publication and translation chronology. Smith dates Le Corbusier\u2019s The\nCity of Tomorrow and its Planning as 1971 though the book was originally\npublished in 1925 in France as Urbanisme and first translated into English in\n1929. He references the publication date of Towards a New Architecture as\n1974 though this was first published in 1923 as Vers une architecture and first\ntranslated into English in 1927. These dry details are significant as Smith\nnot only misplaces the publication dates but also reverses the order of their\noriginal appearance. Urbanisme is in many respects a reply to debates that\n2\narose from the publication of Vers une architecture.1 Moreover, although he\nreferences Kofman & Lebas\u2019 introduction, \u2018Lost in Transposition\u2019, to Lefeb-\nvre\u2019s Writings on Cities (Kofman & Lebas, 1996) he has not taken notice of\ntheir warnings concerning the problems of reading authors in translation. It\nwas Frederick Etchells, in the first English translation, who changed the title\nfrom Vers une architecture to Towards a New Architecture, \u2018perhaps assum-\ning that the English reader would not understand the cultural implications\nin the original title with its connotation of restoring a lost unity \u2019 (Benton,\n1990, p. 46, emphasis added). Etchells also translated Urbanisme as The\nCity of Tomorrow and its Planning again adding a clear future orientation\nabsent from Le Corbusier\u2019s originals. These points are noteworthy given that\nSmith imbues Le Corbusier\u2019s writings with an Utopian forward-looking sen-\nsibility rather than following Le Corbusier\u2019s own insistence that his plans\nwere practical possibilities rooted in the current conditions of the time and\nnot at all Utopian.\nThese works of Le Corbusier which Smith references were written in the\naftermath of the First World War in which there was already the perceived\nthreat of a new war. Furthermore, the devastation that war had brought to\nFrance was uppermost in Le Corbusier\u2019s considerations; overcrowding, pol-\nlution, tuberculosis, poverty and a chronic housing situation were unfolding\nin a highly conservative and nationalist atmosphere. By the end of the 1920s\nLe Corbusier had also largely left behind his interest in the grand and heroic\nmodernist projects that Smith attacks. However, apart from one reference to\nLe Corbusier\u2019s \u2018Voisin Plan\u2019 for Paris from 1925, Smith does not name one\nsingle building or project of Le Corbusier\u2019s, whether conceptual or realised.\nIf Smith\u2019s article had just made passing reference to Le Corbusier such ab-\nsence of detail may be justified. However, Smith refers to Le Corbusier in\nthe title of his piece, bases his view on a reading of the primary material and\nnames no other twentieth century architect or town planner. By this series\nof reductions, Smith makes Le Corbusier synonymous with advocating the\n1According to Docker the whole of The City of Tomorrow and its Planning can be\nviewed as a response to Le Corbusier\u2019s critics: \u2018he evidently felt that he was unfairly being\naccused of ignoring emotion, the poetic, and nature\u2019 (Docker, 1994, p. 10). The critique\nof American cities is also strongly articulated in the latter book as are Le Corbusier\u2019s\nchanging views on skyscrapers. In \u2018Towards. . . \u2019 he considered them as dwellings but, in\n\u2018The City of Tomorrow . . . \u2019 Le Corbusier explicitly rejected the skyscraper as a place to\nlive. Smith, though, sees only \u2018sky-scraping colonies\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 33) with all the\nconnotations that the word \u2018colonies\u2019 carries.\n3\nparticular view of modernity he critiques.\nSimilarly, Smith references Lefebvre\u2019s The Production of Space as be-\ning published in 1994 though it was first published in France in 1974 and\ntranslated into English in 1991. The twenty year gap between 1974 and\n1994 is significant, not least, because Smith does not place Lefebvre\u2019s work\nin any kind of historical or social context. According to McLeod, \u2018Lefeb-\nvre was acutely conscious of the relationship between his philosophy and\nthe historical moment from which it emerged. He insistently historicized his\nclaims, frequently reminding the reader of the conflicts and contradictions in\nFrance that generated his investigations\u2019 (McLeod, 1997, p. 11). So, Lefeb-\nvre\u2019s lifelong intellectual project was concerned to understand the dialectic\nof modernity and everyday life and his specific interrogation of space and\nthe city was intimately tied to this greater preoccupation. La production de\nl\u2019espace (1974), thus, appeared as the key text of a relatively short period\nof explicit spatial theorizing (Kofman & Lebas, 1996)2 within a publishing\nhistory of over 65 years beginning in 1924. As such it is shorn of much of\nthe explicit Marxism which characterizes most of Lefebvre\u2019s other work and\nalso of many of Lefebvre\u2019s specific views concerning modernity (Lefebvre,\n1995).3 In 1974 Lefebvre was also a respected figure in debates concern-\ning the direction of French urban planning having influence on both town\nplanners and architects (see Lefebvre et al, 1967, Kofman & Lebas, ibid:,\np. 35-42, Shields, 1999). During the 1920s, however, the decade that Smith\nfocuses on in terms of his critique of Le Corbusier, Lefebvre was involved in\na number of thoroughly modernist projects of his own; Dada, Surrealism and\neventually Marxism. During this period he was also gathering the materials\n2Unwin\u2019s (2000) observation that The Production of Space was written by a philosopher\nfor other philosophers should also be borne in mind. Le Corbusier was writing fifty years\nbefore as an architect and anticipating a very difference audience. The transposition of\nideas from one domain to another can be fraught with difficulties of translation, intention\nand meaning (see also Elden, 2001).\n3Frampton (1969) makes a very similar point about Le Corbusier\u2019s Vers une architec-\nture that Merryfield (1995) makes in relation to Lefebvre\u2019s La production de l\u2019espace. Both\nare characterized by indicative structure followed by circumlocutory content. Frampton\u2019s\nobservation concerning Le Corbusier\u2019s book that, \u2018Its structure which is clearly tabulated\nin the first few pages bears only an elliptical relation to its actual content which, through\nrecapitulation and transposition, reveals itself as resting on a number of separate but re-\nlated dialectical themes\u2019 (Frampton, ibid, p. 139), is also a perfect description of Lefebvre\u2019s\nLa production de l\u2019espace. Unwin (2000) presents some of the problematic consequences\narising from Lefebvre\u2019s text\u2019s form and structure.\n4\nwhich would later form the basis for expounding the figure of the \u2018Total Man\u2019\n(surely an example of that \u2018paradigmatically masculine subject\u2019 which Smith\nmakes pejoratively synonymous with modernity, Smith, 2001, p. 33).\nTextual constraints\nWhilst the limits of permissible interpretation of particular texts are generally\nseen to be wider now than in the past they still remain a consideration. It\nwould be absurd to ignore the authority of Smith as the author of his own\ntext and to proceed to read the article as a trenchant defence of Le Corbusier\nand critique of Lefebvre, for example. Yet Smith rarely allows Le Corbusier in\nparticular to clearly express his intentions through the use of full quotations\nin context. Rather, a series of snippets of a few words, often even single\nwords, are presented as evidence of views that Smith argues Le Corbusier\nis articulating. One reason for this may be that Le Corbusier is invariably\ntalking about the specifics of architecture as a profession and building as an\nindustry while Smith tends to see his comments foremost as general social\nprescriptions which can be stripped of their specific technical content without\naltering their meaning.\nThe tone of any text also sets an interpretive consideration and Smith\u2019s\nis clearly hostile rather than open towards Le Corbusier. He forces a number\nof disparaging affinities between Le Corbusier\u2019s views and the elimination of\ndifference, the panoptic function of the prison and Orwell\u2019s dystopian 1984\ndictum, \u2018slavery is freedom\u2019, with little textual justification or sensitivity to\ncontext or genre. These associations carry strong negative and hyperbolic\nintentions but, then, the society which Smith constructs is a curious one in\nwhich hyperbole becomes reality. It is a world in which figures including Le\nCorbusier produce \u2018an abstract space that is quite literally, and quite inten-\ntionally, a \u201cno-where\u201d and, in which \u2018modern city-dwellers live hermetically\nsealed existences. . . made quite literally senseless by the constant, confusing\nand meaningless white noise of television\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 32-33, emphases\nadded). Perhaps Smith\u2019s intention is not to be taken seriously after all?\nAnother consideration is the extent to which texts are seen as plastic\nentities to be stretched, re-ordered and chopped up like dough in order to\nsupport particular interpretations. There are very many questionable exam-\nples but space permits only a handful to be discussed. For example, Smith\noffers the following,\n5\nAccording to Le Corbusier, the modern spirit demands the era-\nsure of the specificity of both past and place. It strives to break\nfree from both the \u2018slime\u2019 of social history and the unwelcome\nintrusions of nature\u2019s \u2018disorderly\u2019 conduct, \u2018the nature all around\nus [that] thwarts us\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 31).\nThis quotation suggests strongly a certain belief of Le Corbusier\u2019s but,\nthere are only nine of Le Corbusier\u2019s words here. Within the pages from\nwhich Smith draws this material, Le Corbusier actually argues for humanity\u2019s\nrootedness in nature and, contrary to the claim that he associated nature only\nwith \u2018disorderly\u2019 conduct, emphasises that, \u2018the spirit which animates Nature\nis a spirit of order\u2019 (Le Corbusier, 1987, p. 19).4 Le Corbusier here simply\nmakes no mention of erasing past or place, the modern spirit or anything\nthat could justify Smith\u2019s, \u2018According to Le Corbusier\u2019 approach. Smith\ncontinues, \u2018In the regulated space of the city of tomorrow there is no room\nfor a \u201cmisplaced sentimentalism\u201d that would cling to the past, and progress\nwill ensure that the \u201cvagaries of weather and the seasons can be ignored\u201d\u2019\n(Smith, ibid, p. 32). The words \u2018vagaries of the weather\u2019 appear here as part\nof the same sentence but are from nearly two hundred pages further on in\nLe Corbusier\u2019s text. Whilst Smith references this clearly it does make one\ncautious about accepting a line of argument that rests on such small snippets\nof such widely separated material,\nThe builders\u2019 yard must become a workshop with a proper staff\nand machinery and specialized gangs. The vagaries of the weather\nand seasons can then be ignored. \u2018Building\u2019 must cut out its \u2018off\nseasons\u2019 (Le Corbusier, ibid, p. 220).\nHere Le Corbusier is plainly speaking only of making the building in-\ndustry more productive and the idea that he wanted his architecture and\ntown-planning to be hostile to weather and the seasons is entirely fallacious.\nOn numerous occasions from within the pages of the books Smith quotes the\nexact opposite is expressed. For example, after complaining that the pollu-\ntion which results from the congested traffic in the centre of Paris is killing\nthe trees, Le Corbusier exclaims, \u2018Only May! What has happened to the\n4The disparity in page numbers arises from that fact that I am using different English\neditions to Smith, they though are the same translations.\n6\nseasons?\u2019 (Le Corbusier, ibid, p. 199). Further on after detailing his plans\nfor a \u2018Contemporary City\u2019 which included 85-95% of all the ground space\nbeing given over to parks, trees, gardens, orchards and allotments, Le Cor-\nbusier imagines a profusion of hanging gardens sprouting from every dwelling\nand argues, \u2018we are still children of Nature; and we have seen that an urban\nmanifestation which completely ignored Nature would soon find itself at odds\nwith our deepest primeval impulses\u2019 (Le Corbusier, ibid, p. 237). Not only in\nhis writings but also in his architectural practice, Le Corbusier demonstrates\nhis filial view of nature. It is also manifested in his drawings, paintings,\ntapestries and sculptures. All evidence, for one commentator, to charge Le\nCorbusier with an increasing \u2018obsession with the harmony of nature\u2019 (Curtis,\n2001, p. 225).\nA further interpretive consideration is the extent to which justifiable\nmeaning can be attributed to the shortest snippets of an author\u2019s writing. It\nwould surely be possible to extract three word quotations from any text and\nread many different meanings into them? I will consider one such example\nhere though, again, there are many in Smith\u2019s account,\nModernity\u2019s principle is repetition. It seeks salvation in the de\nnovo creation of \u2018types\u2019 and through the eradification of \u2018differ-\nence\u2019 and of everything unique. \u2018Repetition dominates every-\nthing\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 32).\nLeaving aside the veracity of this claim, Le Corbusier\u2019s three words \u2018rep-\netition dominates everything\u2019 are used to support Smith\u2019s contention. Yet it\nis simply not clear whether Le Corbusier is using these words approvingly,\ndisapprovingly or as straightforward description. Context is also lacking;\nwas Le Corbusier, when he wrote these three words, arguing for the social\nelimination of everything different or unique from modernity? No, the words\ncome from the section identified earlier where Le Corbusier is considering\nthe inefficient state of the French building industry against the backdrop of\na chronic housing shortage. He titles this section \u2018On Repetition or Mass\nProduction\u2019 and repetition is used here as a synonym for mass production.\nLe Corbusier remarks that, \u2018Repetition dominates everything. We are unable\nto produce industrially at normal prices without it; it is impossible to solve\nthe housing problem without it\u2019 (Le Corbusier, 1987, p. 220). Of course,\nSmith may interpret the French building industry in 1929 as synonymous\n7\nwith \u2018modernitys grand scheme\u2019 as a whole or he may be insinuating that\nevery brick, window frame, tile and door should be produced in a different\nway and with a unique form in order to avoid the tyranny of repetition. This,\nthough, is not made clear.\nFinally, there are competing interpretations of the same material which\nmay throw new light onto familiar territory. Crow (1989), for example, offers\na very different reading to Smith of The City of Tomorrow and its Planning.\nFor Crow, Le Corbusier\u2019s technical and rational approach to city planning\nis \u2018constantly at odds with his other signifying strategies\u2019 used throughout\nthe book (Crow, 1989, p. 241). This text \u2018challenges the distinction between\nmodernism and postmodernism\u2019 and \u2018questions any attempt to place it in\neither modern or postmodern periods of philosophical history\u2019 (Crow, ibid, p.\n241). The use of cartoons, drawings, photographs, architectural renderings,\nphoto-montages, reproductions of postcards, graphs, charts, paintings and\ncollages are all integral to Le Corbusier\u2019s texts and it is these that for Crow\nundermine Le Corbusier\u2019s textual strategies. According to Crow \u2018Through\nall the strategies he uses to construct and privilege geometry, science and\ntechnique against poetry, art and politics, these seemingly \u201cmarginalized\u201d\nelements not only slip through his grid of arguments but also overpower it\u2019\n(Crow, ibid, p. 243). Crow, then, suggests the possibility of other readings,\nyet Smith, privileging the interpretation of text above all other signifying\npractices, is blind to such possibilities (though there are 215 of them spread\nover the book\u2019s 300 pages and they can be found on all but one of the pages\nfrom which Smith quotes).\nLefebvre and Le Corbusier\nLefebvre\u2019s few, scattered comments on Le Corbusier are also open to differing\ninterpretations. Lefebvre\u2019s position on Le Corbusier remained pretty much\nunexamined and unchanged from the early 1960s to the mid 1980s (McLeod,\n1997) and it seems to be predicated on a very narrow reading of Le Cor-\nbusier from the 1920s, possibly only through secondary sources (there are\nno primary references in The Production of Space). Smith summarizes as\nfollows,\nThus according to Lefebvre, \u2018Le Corbusier ideologizes as he ra-\ntionalizes\u2019. His architecture \u2018turned out to be in the service of\n8\nthe state. . . despite the fact its advent was hailed as a revolu-\ntion. . . Le Corbusier, expressed (formulated and met) the archi-\ntectural requirements of state capitalism\u2019. Far from being \u2018natu-\nral\u2019, modernism\u2019s abstract and Cartesian conception of space was\nan \u2018ideology in action\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 36, emphasis in original).\nThis quotation is assembled from material covering five pages of The\nProduction of Space and while it is a reasonable reflection of Lefebvre\u2019s view\nof Le Corbusier, a fuller version may be of interest,\nLe Corbusier ideologizes as he rationalizes - unless perhaps it\nis the other way around. An ideological discourse upon nature,\nsunshine and greenery successfully concealed from everyone at\nthis time - and in particular from Le Corbusier - the true meaning\nand content of such architectural projects (Lefebvre, 1991, p. 303-\n4).\nContrary to Smith\u2019s claim that Le Corbusier was antagonistic towards\nnature, Lefebvre is arguing the exact opposite. Moreover, Lefebvre seems to\nbe somewhat excusing Le Corbusier\u2019s plans caught up as he saw them in an\nall pervasive ideology of nature abroad at the time. However, Lefebvre is far\nfrom consistent in this regard. On another occasion he approvingly prefaces a\ncritique of Le Corbusier\u2019s supposed functionalism with the following, \u2018As for\nLe Corbusier, as philosopher of the city he describes the relationship between\nthe urban dweller and dwelling with nature, air, sun, and trees with cyclical\ntime and the rhythms of the cosmos\u2019 (Lefebvre in Kofman & Lebas, 1996, p.\n98). In terms of his architecture meeting the \u2018requirements of state capital-\nism\u2019 Lefebvre does indeed charge Le Corbusier with this. However, he also\nincludes the Bauhaus and the Soviet Constructivists here, and as Gregory\n(1994) observes Lefebvre\u2019s ire was directed far more towards the Bauhaus.\nThere are several references to the Bauhaus omitted from Smith\u2019s quotation\nabove and nowhere does Lefebvre provide the kind of lengthy disquisition on\nLe Corbusier that he does on the Bauhaus (Lefebvre, 1991, p. 123-26.) It\nis to the Bauhaus that Lefebvre repeatedly ascribes an \u2018historic role\u2019 in the\nproduction of abstract space.5\n5From the pages of The Production of Space, Smith could have built a far more cogent\nand coherent case by linking the Bauhaus to Lefebvre and the abstract space of modernity.\nWhy he has chosen to focus on Le Corbusier is unclear.\n9\nLefebvre also clearly demarcated Le Corbusier\u2019s architectural theory from\nhis architectural practice being much more generous to the latter: \u2018Le Cor-\nbusier\u2019s architectural practice is seen to be more hesitant, more flexible and\nmore vital than his architectural theory\u2019 (Lefebvre, 1972, p. i-ii). And, even\nthough he described Le Corbusier as a \u2018good architect\u2019 but a \u2018catastrophic\nurbanist\u2019 (Lefebvre in Kofman& Lebas, 1997, p. 207), he regarded Le Cor-\nbusier\u2019s 1942 Charte d\u2019Athnes as a \u2018milestone of prime importance\u2019, and an\nattempt to \u2018make the notion of harmony concrete\u2019 (Lefebvre, 1995, p. 393).\nSmith, however, sees no difference between Le Corbusier\u2019s architecture or\nhis town-planning or, indeed, between the conceptual and practical dimen-\nsions of each. It is all reduced to the level of the \u2018Same\u2019 to borrow Smith\u2019s\nterminology.\nPast, place and difference\nReturning to Smith\u2019s assertion that \u2018According to Le Corbusier, the modern\nspirit demands the erasure of the specificity of both past and place\u2019 (Smith,\n2001, p. 31), Le Corbusier does not agree,\nThe past has been my one master and continues to be my constant\nguide. Any reflective man thrust into the unknown of architec-\ntural invention cannot base his creative spark on anything but\nthe lessons taught by past ages, and the signposts time has left\nstanding are of permanent human value (Le Corbusier, 1999, p.\n56-57).\nAfter hubristically detailing the part he played in saving the old Alge-\nrian Casbah, the Old Port of Marseilles and the heritage of Barcelona, Le\nCorbusier complains that, \u2018All this hasn\u2019t prevented my critics from accus-\ning me of wanting to systematically destroy the past\u2019 (ibid, p. 58). He fills\nthe pages of Towards a New Architecture and The City of Tomorrow and its\nPlanning with references to, and sketches of, historic cities which he admires\nincluding medieval Sienna, Venice, Bruges and Rome and argues \u2018I do not\nfeel that I am breaking with tradition: I believe myself to be absolutely tra-\nditional in my theories\u2019 (Le Corbusier, 1987, p. 300). He even regarded the\noverly-rational \u2018Voisin Plan\u2019 for Paris as respecting and rescuing both past\nand place and he included the preservation of many buildings, monuments,\n10\narcades and doorways within the redeveloped area (Le Corbusier, 1987, p.\n287).\nSmith\u2019s tendency to make both Le Corbusier specifically, and architec-\nture and town-planning generally, synonymous with modernity is overblown.\nAccording to Gregory, while critical of the \u2018strange sort of liberty\u2019 that Le\nCorbusier defended, \u2018For all his importance, it would be wrong to cast Le Cor-\nbusier as paradigmatic of modernism; the movement was never monolithic\u2019\n(Gregory, 1994, p. 340). Similarly, Best and Kellner argue that, \u2018The most\nstriking exceptions to the International Style were the inventive modernist\nconstructions of Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019, and, \u2018Moreover, Le\nCorbusier explored tensions, ambiguities, and paradoxes that subvert oppo-\nsitions such as those between machine and biology, between mathematical\nmeasure and lyricism, between engineering and aesthetics\u2019 (Best and Kell-\nner, 1997, p. 144-45). Reducing social formations to the specifics of their\n\u2018spatial\u2019 culture, whether represented or lived, is an anti-social exercise which\nLe Corbusier himself recognized,\nTown-planning, \u2018has become a sort of dumping ground for every\ndifficult and unresolved problem such as the birth-rate, the social\nequilibrium, alcoholism, crime, the morale of the great city, civic\naffairs and so forth (Le Corbusier, 1987, p. 130).\nMoreover, Le Corbusier\u2019s views cannot be simply reduced to the \u2018moral\ndiscourse on straight lines, on right angles\u2019 with which Smith, quoting Lefeb-\nvre, charges him (Smith,, ibid, p. 36). Le Corbusier\u2019s admiration of the\nstraight line was not so much theoretical as practical; he regarded it as the\nbest way to solve the problem of contemporary motor traffic. He included\ncurved streets within his plans as more appropriate for strolling within the\ngreen spaces of his garden cities and, during the 1920s and beyond curved and\ncircular shapes were increasingly part of Le Corbusier\u2019s architectural prac-\ntice. Smith, though, seems to link all benevolence to the curved line with\nhis language that contrasts meanders, loops and eddies favourably with vec-\ntors, straight lines and right angles whilst concurrently and disingenuously\nexpelling the curve both from Le Corbusier\u2019s work and from modernity.\nSmith also ties Le Corbusier\u2019s discussions of productive techniques too\nclosely to some implied moral prescription for society as a whole. When\n11\nLe Corbusier is talking about standardization, mass production and prefab-\nrication he is doing so almost exclusively in relation to the production of\nhousing units. Take, for example, Smith\u2019s inevitable swipe at Le Corbusier\u2019s\nnotion of dwellings as \u2018machine-houses\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 33).6 Reflecting in\n1943 on his architectural emphasis on the home and his choice of the phrase\n\u2018machine for living\u2019, Le Corbusier comments that, \u2018I was never forgiven for\nthat expression, neither in Paris nor in the U.S.A.- in the U.S.A. where the\nmachine is king\u2019 (Le Corbusier, 1999, p. 26). Moreover, \u2018A house has to\nfulfil two purposes. First it is a machine for living in, that is, a machine to\nprovide us with efficient help for speed and accuracy in our work, a diligent\nand helpful machine which should satisfy all our physical needs: comfort.\nBut it should also be a place conducive to meditation, and, lastly, a beau-\ntiful place, bringing much-needed tranquillity to the mind\u2019 (Le Corbusier in\nWeston, 1996, p. 100). Le Corbusier is clearly not here preaching the elim-\nination of social difference and Harvey (who Smith repeatedly uses against\nLe Corbusier), while highly critical of many aspects of Le Corbusier\u2019s work\nand character, argues that, \u2018his project was internationalist, and emphasized\nthe kind of unity in which a socially conscious notion of individual difference\ncould be fully explored\u2019 (Harvey, 1989, p. 271). Furthermore, Le Corbusier is\nnot even arguing for the elimination of architectural difference. Standardized\nunits can be configured in many different forms and Le Corbusier constantly\nemphasizes his belief that the result will be architectural variety and diversity\nrather than uniformity and, of course, standardized and repetitive building\ntechniques and forms are centuries old phenomena. As Lefebvre observes\nwhilst commenting in 1962 on the medieval village of Navarrenx, twice re-\nbuilt in the Middle Ages according to geometric ground plans, \u2018It is amazing\nthe diversity which can be obtained spontaneously from the same unchanging\n(or \u201cstructural\u201d) regional elements. . . \u2019 (Lefebvre, 1995, p. 116-117).7\nThere is also a more direct commentary of interest from Lefebvre on Le\nCorbusier which touches upon these themes: Boudon (1972) published a\nstudy of Le Corbusier\u2019s 1920s workers\u2019 housing project at Pessac in South\nWest France. In particular, Boudon documented the manner in which the in-\n6Lefebvre also uses the term to attack Le Corbusier commenting that a, \u2018machine for\nliving in, [is] the appropriate habitat for a man-machine (Lefebvre, 1991, p. 303).\n7Lefebvre is clear that there has always been town-planning but that it is capitalism\nthat produces the distinctive type of town-planning that he opposes. Lefebvre is certainly\nnot anti-planning (see Kofman & Lebas, 2000).\n12\nhabitants had altered Le Corbusier\u2019s original design. Lefebvre contributed a\nshort preface to the book referring to Le Corbusier as a \u2018genius\u2019 whose houses\nat Pessac were adapted by their inhabitants by introducing \u2018personal quali-\nties\u2019 which produced a \u2018differentiated social cluster\u2019. According to Lefebvre,\nLe Corbusier intended to build a predetermined, homogeneous and functional\nsystem whose standardization was overcome by the adaptations of the inhab-\nitants as they put their needs into action. However, Boudon\u2019s study provides\na different interpretation which suggests that Lefebvre was misinformed con-\ncerning Le Corbusier\u2019s architectural intentions at Pessac. For Boudon, \u2018the\nmodifications carried out by the occupants constitute a positive and not a\nnegative consequence of Le Corbusier\u2019s original conception\u2019 (Boudon, 1972,\np. 161, emphasis added). Boudon argues that the geometric differentiation\nthat resulted from the use of standardized components in different configu-\nrations provided both architect and occupants with the scope to realize their\ndifferentiated intentions through adaptation and modification. For Boudon,\none of the essential features of Le Corbusiers spatial conception at Pessac was\nthat it, \u2018facilitated and, to a certain extent, even encouraged such alterations\u2019\n(Boudon, ibid, p. 114, emphasis in original). Boudon\u2019s extensive interviews\nwith the occupants support these findings: the original occupants did not ob-\nject to the standardization that Le Corbusier employed and, the imaginative\nand varied alterations made by the inhabitants were not motivated by the\ndesire to \u2018personalise the standardized appearance of the houses, but in order\nto bring out or enhance the personal qualities that they already possessed\u2019\n(Boudon, 1972, p. 152).\nConclusion\nThis paper has not had the scope to deal with Smith\u2019s provocative thesis\nconcerning the ethically normalizing force of the abstract space of moder-\nnity. It has also not been possible to discuss the questionable use made of\nLefebvre\u2019s equally questionable spatial categories. It has sought, rather, to\nadvance a different Le Corbusier from the portrayal found in Smith\u2019s paper.\nWhilst he was certainly the designer of detested schemes such as the Voisin\nPlan for Paris and other emblems of heroic modernism, Le Corbusier was\nalso the most vernacular of the pioneer modernists. Whilst he curried favour\nwith the bourgeoisie he was also acutely aware of the need to improve the\nbasic living conditions of the proletariat. While he naively relied on the social\n13\nreform of technocrats he was not himself a technocrat. A more complex and\nambiguous Le Corbusier, and a fuller account of Lefebvre\u2019s attitude towards\nLe Corbusier, has been suggested. Concerns regarding the contextualisation\nof ideas and the malleability of texts have also been advanced. However, to\ninsist on the importance of context is perhaps one of the difference destroy-\ning strategies of the modernity which Smith seeks to oppose. After all, he\ndoes clearly affirm his intentions, \u2018anything and everything is liable at any\nmoment to be ripped from its particular context\u2019 (Smith, 2001, p. 36).\nReferences\nBenton, T.
