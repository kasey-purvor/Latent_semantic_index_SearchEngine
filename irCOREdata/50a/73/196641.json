She tested it at the Open University \nwith tutorial groups whose members communicated through asynchronous bulletin boards \nbased on FirstClass conferencing software. The model, with examples of its application, was \npublished in E-moderating (Salmon 2000, 2004).  She also studied the design of learning \ntasks for groups at each stage of the model, again for asynchronous online discussion forums, \n                                                 \n1 Second Life and Linden Lab are trademarks of Linden Research, Inc.  \n and published E-tivities (Salmon 2002). With David Jaques, she wrote later on how to use the \nmodel in blended teaching and learning, in Learning in Groups (Jacques and Salmon 2007).  \nHer 5-stage model has informed online learning and development practice across \nmany levels from school pupils to postgraduate research students, and especially in online \nand blended learning in higher and professional education. It has served disciplines ranging \nfrom arts to science and practice-based subjects such as nursing and management. Although \nmore recently, wikis and blogs have been deployed, its applications have been based mainly \non text and asynchronous conferencing (Skinner 2009; Kovacic et al. 2008; Pettenati and \nCigognini, 2009). \nIn this paper, we describe developments and discuss findings from three case studies \nof testing the model\u2019s applicability to teaching and learning in Second Life. We summarise \nthe model and explain the nature of SL, a 3-D multi-user virtual environment. \nSalmon\u2019s 5-stage model in brief \nStage 1 (at the base of the flight of steps) includes individuals\u2019 essential prerequisites for \neffective participation: access and the ability to benefit from remote group work for learning. \nStage 2 involves individuals establishing a personal online identity and then finding others \nwith whom to interact. At Stage 3, participants give and receive relevant and useful \ninformation about the course, and undertake course-related learning tasks. Up to and \nincluding Stage 3, a form of co-operation occurs through support by other participants for \neach person\u2019s goals. At Stage 4, more complex constructive tasks are possible, discussions \noccur and the interaction becomes more collaborative. At Stage 5, participants look for more \nbenefits from the system; they want help in achieving their own goals, in exploring how to \nintegrate their online experiences into other forms of learning and in transferring and \napplying their learning. At this stage sophisticated individual learning may occur that \nincludes reflection on and transfer of knowledge.  \n  \nFigure 1: Model of teaching and learning online (Salmon 2004, 29) \n \nEach stage requires participants to master technical skills, shown at the bottom left of \neach step. Each stage calls for different human intervention skills (e-moderating), shown at \nright top of each step. The \u2018interactivity bar\u2019 running vertically along the right of the flight of \nsteps suggests the intensity of interactivity that can be expected between the participants at \neach stage. At stage 1, individuals interact only with one or two others. After Stage 2, the \nnumber of those with whom they interact \u2013 and the frequency of these interactions \u2013 \ngradually increases. In Stage 5 they often return to more individual learning pursuits. \nThe nature of 3-D Multi-User Virtual Environments and Second Life \n3-D Multi-User Virtual Environments (3-D MUVEs) provide virtual three-dimensional \nspaces, tailored by their designers, which can accommodate more than one user at a time. \nMany virtual games are played out in such spaces, but our interest is in Second Life, a 3-D \n social software application. Its developers, Linden Lab2 in California, say, \u201cIt is a free online \nvirtual world imagined and created by its residents.\u201d (http:\/\/secondlife.com\/whatis).  \nSL was the third most popular social software application in the UK in 2009, after \nFacebook and YouTube. SL is by far the most widely used 3-D MUVE for teaching and \nlearning (Warburton 2009) and hundreds of universities, mostly in the UK and US, have a \npresence in SL (Kirriemuir 2008). As Warburton (2009, 415) notes \u201ca virtual world [like SL] \nprovides an experience set within a technological environment that gives the user a strong \nsense of being there\u201d.  \nSL is a social environment, not a game; its participants each have at least one avatar, \n(a virtual representation of themselves) able to move around in the 3-D environment and \ninteract with other avatars. Avatars do more or less whatever they like, including teaching \nand learning (Salmon and Hawkridge 2009). Potentially, SL provides very powerful new \ncultural experiences for learning and for groups to work together in innovative and engaging \nways (Salmon 2009).  \nHowever, reflecting on the experience of developing the Schome Park Programme \n(SPP), Twining suggested that \u201c...open virtual worlds are unclaimed spaces as far as \neducation is concerned\u2014educators have not yet established norms of how to support learning \nwithin them\u201d  (2009, 503).  We agree that a key challenge is to design educational activities \nin virtual worlds, while exploiting the social nature of the visual environment.  \nTesting Salmon\u2019s model in Second Life \nInstead of designing for learning in SL from \u2018scratch\u2019, we chose to test the 5-stage model that \nhad proved so useful in text-based 2-D environments. Within MOOSE (MOdelling Of \nSecond life Environment, www.le.ac.uk\/beyonddistance\/moose), a JISC-funded research \nproject, our three case studies tested the model\u2019s usefulness in relation to teaching and \nlearning in SL. They involved students and tutors from three courses at two HE institutions: \n                                                 \n2 Second Life and Linden Lab are trademarks of Linden Research, Inc. \n at the University of Leicester, a postgraduate distance learning course in Archaeology and a \npostgraduate campus-based course in Media and Communications, and, at the London South \nBank University, a campus-based undergraduate course in Digital Photography. \nDevelopment of artefacts and activities in SL \nWe supported the SL tutors in their design of activities in SL (SL-tivities) based on the \nmodel\u2019s stages, including interesting collaborative tasks, thus scaffolding students\u2019 learning \nand group work.  We ensured that artefacts were built in SL to provide \u201ca stimulus or a start \n(the \u2018spark\u2019) to the interaction\u201d (Salmon 2002, 4).  \nCase Study 1 \nAt Leicester, the Department of Archaeology developed two artefacts to support learning \nabout the concept of using space and landscape.  One simulated an aspect of the lives of \nancient Saami people in Northern Scandinavia.  The other simulated a village of the Kalasha, \nan ethnic group from the Hindu Kush Mountains in the northwest of Pakistan. In both Saami \nand Kalasha cultures, access to social spaces depends on the individual\u2019s gender and social \nstatus.  \nStudents were inducted into SL through creating their avatars and given opportunities \nto navigate around the Saami tent and Kalasha village, see the layout and division of the \nspace, and explore where they could and could not go according to the gender assigned to \ntheir avatars. They were encouraged to interact with each other (avatar: avatar) about what \nthey found, experienced, thought and felt.  \nA version of the Saami tent is available as an open educational resource \n(http:\/\/slurl.com\/secondlife\/Media%20Zoo\/177\/222\/24\/) under the OTTER (Open, \nTransferable, Technology-enabled Educational Resource \nhttp:\/\/ww2.le.ac.uk\/departments\/beyond-distance-research-alliance\/projects\/otter) project.  \n Case Study 2 \nAt London South Bank, the Department of Digital Photography deployed \u2018virtual \nstory cubes\u2019 for teaching. Students as avatars practised taking snapshots in SL, using camera \ncontrol commands and changing SL \u2018environmental\u2019 settings to take high quality digital \nphotographs. They \u2018set off\u2019 to visit different islands in SL and captured a variety of digital \nimages representing different subcultures. They learned how to create a cube with their \npictures and manipulate it by changing the size, the texture and moving it. Student avatars \nthen demonstrated their individual cubes to others and shared experience about places they \nhad visited and why they had taken the photos. Finally, they put all the individual cubes \ntogether and created illustrated stories from them, negotiating on the shape of the combined \ncubes, the order of them and which sides to show.  \nCase Study 3 \nAt Leicester, the Media and Communications Department designed two SL-tivities to \nenable students to investigate digital identity issues. Avatars were teleported to different \nplaces in SL where they met and interacted with others. They were teleported back to the \nuniversity\u2019s Media Zoo Island to share together news of what and whom they had \nencountered and how their experiences had enhanced their understanding of digital identity. \nResearch methodology \nAs this was an early study, students were recruited on a voluntary basis. Their engagement \nwith SL-tivities and learning experiences at each stage of the model was studied using \nqualitative methods. We captured data from the students in two ways. We conducted semi-\nstructured interviews, lasting 40-60 minutes, focussing on their personal experiences of \nlearning and using SL, and on contributions to their learning at each stage of the 5-stage \nmodel. We recorded the chat logs of students\u2019 discussion in each teaching session. The chat \nlogs enabled mapping of student dialogue against each stage of the model, going back to \nSalmon\u2019s original research. \n Cognitive mapping was the method used to develop the original 5-stage model .We \nanalysed the interview data by using cognitive mapping (Bryson et al. 2004), to create unique \nvisual causal representations of individuals and groups and their changing views, feelings and \nexperiences. The methodology is grounded in theories of personal constructs (Kelly 1955), \nand supported by Decision Explorer software (www.banxia.com\/demain.html).  \n \nWhen conducting SL related research, there are ethical considerations in collecting \nand using data from chat logs, observations and the use of images of avatars. We ensured that \nparticipants knew how data would be used and that we had their informed consent. \nFindings: the 5-stage model in Second Life  \nStage 1: Access and motivation \nGaining access is an essential precondition for learning in any online environment. By \ncomparison with simpler text-based 2-D environments such as computer conferencing, SL \npresents additional challenges but also advantages. Participants must create their avatars and \nlearn to manipulate them in SL. MOOSE showed the importance of preparing learners in SL \nitself, helping them to acquire the basic skills of moving, navigating and communicating \neffectively. Acquiring these avatar-driving skills is a more complex process than being \ninducted into text-based learning environments which feel familiar to e-mail users. However, \nfor a small greater investment, SL skills lead to exciting, motivating and fun experiences for \nparticipants.  \nStage 1 applies equally to students and their tutors (SL-moderators). We found that it \nwas best to split the stage into two steps: \nStep 1: Learning individually \nThe first step focuses on helping individuals to gain access to SL, creating an avatar and \nchoosing its avatar name, logging on, teleporting, movements and group communication \ntools. We developed a MOOSE guide for participants to work through at their own pace \n (Wheeler and Salmon 2008). The guide incorporates YouTube videos that demonstrate the \nbasic skills. Students told us that they found this guide useful and the videos easy to follow.  \nStep 2: Learning in a group in-world \nHowever competence in more sophisticated in-world skills such as movement including \nflying, gestures, navigation, camera control, private chat, searching and use of simple \ndevelopment tools need to be developed. Mastering such skills in SL is a prerequisite for \nstudents to appreciate the whole environment, to feel comfortable and confident in exploring \nits resources independently, and to engage later in SL-tivities. \nWe provided a one-hour training session for students and staff, delivered in-world, \navatar-to- avatar. Participants were shown and practised skills useful for taking part in SL-\ntivities. Students appreciated the opportunity to have an in-world training session, especially \nto avoid \u2018getting lost\u2019 and for building confidence in the environment. We consider this \ngaining of personal control and confidence a key prerequisite for motivating them to return \nand take part. \nStudents also appreciated the opportunity to learn in an avatar group and interact with \nothers at the same level of understanding, through their avatars. The nature of engagement in \nSL is somewhat different from that of text-based asynchronous discussion forums, where \nsocialisation with others occurs via postings, reading and replying to each other, possibly \nover days or weeks.  However, The 3-D and immediacy of SL, the realistic feel to the \nartefacts and the co-presence immersion result in the personal experience of socialisation in \nSL \u2018feeling\u2019 similar to that of RL. This co-presence in SL means that opportunities for \nsocialisation are available from the moment the participants meet each other in-world. They \ndemonstrated high motivation to engage with each other (Figure 2).  \n  \nFigure 2: In-world group training offers socialisation opportunities for student avatars \n \nWe conclude that it is beneficial to build in-world skills development for small groups \nof learners together from Stage 1, and ensure that participants meet each others\u2019 avatars in the \nfirst group training session, rather than attempt individual training for everyone.  The Stage 1 \nexperience contributes to continuing access and motivation to continue, and provides the \nbasis for more complex avatar: avatar interactions at stage 2. \nStage 2: Online socialisation \nStage two of the original 5-stage model involves participants establishing their online \nidentities, finding others with whom to interact online, understanding the nature of the online \nenvironment and how it is used for learning, and developing trust and mutual respect to work \ntogether at common tasks. All of these are necessary for stage 2 in SL but perhaps especially \nthe establishment of online identity through avatars which is a more complex experience. SL \npresents opportunities as well as challenges for establishing online identity. \nOur study found that for some participants the visual appearance of their avatar on the \nscreen and their learning to \u2018drive\u2019 it are powerful enough for them to feel that the avatar is \npart of themselves. One participant said that she immediately \u2018felt attached to her [the \navatar]\u2019. Another said, \u2018I feel like I am an avatar\u2019 and a third, \u2018my avatar is a fantasy \nextension of me\u2019. A significant milestone is reached when participants begin to feel that they \n are establishing a new and coherent identity through their avatars. This critical moment took \nlonger for some than others.  \nMeeting other avatars helps develop personal avatar identity. We ensured that, by the \nend of Stage 1, participants had each constructed their first avatar. When they ventured \naround SL and met other avatars, they began to realise the social nature of the immersive \nworld; the interactions with other avatars in SL \u2018felt\u2019 real. For example, one participant felt \nthreatened when an avatar that she met offered to teleport her to another place in SL.  \nAnother participant wanted to change the look of her avatar when she met an avatar with \nsimilar looks and outfit! \nWe plan more SL-tivities to enable personal and group development through \nparticipants focusing on their avatars and developing a sense of \u2018inhabitation\u2019 for future \nprojects. We recommend that sessions should include activities such as changing the \nappearance and making modification to avatars, animating avatars by learning how to make \ngestures and movements,  taking avatars shopping and field trips to different places in-world, \nby interacting with other avatars living in SL, and sharing, exchanging and reflecting on the \nin-world experiences.  \nIn the original 5-stage model, online socialisation stands for more than merely \n\u2018socialising\u2019. It includes understanding how being online contributes to learning for their \ntopic, this course, this learning group.  Our study concludes that SL sessions offer two more \nways for socialisation than in text-based environments. The first is enabled by artefacts \navailable in SL which encourage avatars interest and dialogue. The second is through the \nmeeting, greeting and seeing the avatars of others, i.e., impactful co-presence. As Meadows \nobserved identity is a vital aspect to consider in developing learning activities in SL \n(Meadows 2008). \n SL offers opportunities for socialising around artefacts that cannot be provided in \ntext-based environments. For example, Box 1 is a conversation in text between avatars \n(students) gathered around the Saami tent. \nBox 1: Students commenting on the artefacts around the Saami tent \n \n[6:55] *Avatar 1: I like the crackling fire :) \n[6:55] Avatar trainer: my pot over the fire is new! It cost me $L155. \n[6:55] Avatar 1: Oh, how nice! What are you cooking? :) \n[6:56] Avatar trainer: some special broth! \n[6:56] Avatar 1:  The rugs look so real. \n[6:57] Avatar trainer: I knitted them the weekend that\u2019s why! \n[6:57] Avatar 1: You're very talented. \n[6.57] Avatar2: :-) \n[6:57] Avatar trainer: Well, some people have the skills! :-) \n[6:57] Avatar 1: Do you have to knit in the middle of the tent or in the men's section? \n \nOur analysis showed that there was laughter in the early SL sessions. In text-based \nenvironments, humour can be difficult to achieve until the group is well established. In Box \n2, students are joking when they can\u2019t get into the Saami tent. \nBox 2: Humour and laughter in SL \n[7:09] Avatar facilitator 1: Well I can't move at all \u2013 I think I'm a lost reindeer \n[7:10] Avatar 1: No luck getting in? \n[7:11] Avatar facilitator 1: Let's try again \u2013 we're all blocked from somewhere. It shows \nhow strong these cultural conventions are! \n[7:11] Avatar 1:  I think we need to make our own tent :) \n[7.12] Avatar 2: No problem :-) \n \nObservation and interviews with participants showed that they were aware of SL as a \nsocial environment from the very start of their participation. They reported that SL allowed \nthem to get to know each other better and faster than in text-based environments. As one \nstudent put it, \u2018due to the interaction, you quickly sort of get to know somebody, like E, she is \nvery polite, very nice, so I got this first image of her\u2019. A view of others\u2019 characteristics \noccurred earlier and more easily than in text-based environments where there is often some \ndiscomfort and much more effort needs to be put into establishing presence and trust (Salmon \nand Lawless 2006). The characteristic recognition by new avatars of the high social presence \n encourages self-disclosure; they express feelings and emotions and they contribute further to \nonline socialisation and group building. \nBox 3 shows an example of self-disclosure in SL. This happened in the in-world \ntraining session where the avatars of a group of distance learners met in SL for the first time. \nThey quickly started sharing some aspects of their personal life with each other without \nprompting by the SL-moderator. \nBox 3: Self-disclosure in SL \n \n[7:00] Avatar 3: Are all of you taking the theory module? \n[7:00] Avatar 2: Yes. \n[7:00] Avatar 1: I was but deferred it because I was in the hospital... so I'll be starting \nagain in July. \n[7:00] Avatar 2: Are you well again? \n[7:01] Avatar 1: Yes, thank you! \n[7:01] Avatar Trainer: I need to pop away and set something up please keep chatting \n[7:01] Avatar 1: Are you both from the UK? \n[7:01] Avatar 5: No, I\u00b4m from Germany. And you? \n[7:01] Avatar 2: I'm from the US. \n[7:02] Avatar 3: I'm from Germany as well, but living in France. \n[7:02] Avatar 1: Wow :) \n[7:02] Avatar 2: Where from? \n[7:02] Avatar 1: New Jersey \n[7:02] Avatar 3: Born in Freiburg, but grew up in Kempten, in Bavaria. How about \nyou? \n[7:02] Avatar 2: I\u00b4ve been to Virginia once, I really liked it. \n[7:03] Avatar 1: Yes, Virginia's pretty, I like it too. \n[7:03] Avatar trainer:  OK I\u2019m back- I do not want to stop you but I'll have to! \n[7:03] Avatar 1: I've been to Munich and really liked it. \n[7:03] Avatar 2: I live in Sindelfingen near Stuttgart, but I was born in Munich. \n \nBox 4 is an example in which avatars of a group of distance students, in their first \nteaching session in SL, shared their feelings. \nBox 4: Sharing personal feelings in SL \n[6:51] Avatar trainer: I'm very excited and nervous! \n[6:51] Avatar 1: I'm very nervous :) \n[6:51] Avatar trainer: This is the first time I have helped someone else teach in here \nso please be patient with us! \n[6:52] Avatar 1: Of course! \n[6:52] Avatar 2: And I\u00b4m nervous, too! \n Being in an immersive virtual environment, with interaction through avatars, as well \nas making timely and seamless conversation, are all approximations of real life, and enable \nhumour to bubble up easily. Box 5 is an example of humour that came through naturally \nduring a teaching session. \nBox 5: Humour during a teaching session in SL \n[7:41]  Avatar 1: I feel like I am in your company \n[7:42]  Avatar 1: Like a real class \n[7:42] Avatar 2: Yes, a part of a group \n[7:42] Avatar facilitator 1: Well, I feel like a prune standing up here \n[7:42] Avatar 3: It's less anonymous \n[7:42] Avatar 1: ha ha \n[7:42] Avatar 3: Sit down! \n[7:42] Avatar 2: :) \n[7:42] Avatar facilitator 1: I'm not sure I know how to sit down yet! It might be \nembarrassing! \n[7:43] Avatar 1: We won't laugh. :) \n[7:43] Avatar 3: Right-click on sit \n[7:43] Avatar facilitator 1: Thanks - that's helpful. But I might fly instead ... \n \nThe Media and Communications students\u2019 avatars had no prior contact before \nmeeting in SL. They were not informed which avatar was driven by a tutor and which by a \nstudent, nor did they try and determine RL roles during their SL sessions. We conclude that \nthe avatars did not find it necessary either before or during the SL sessions to investigate each \nothers\u2019 RL roles. However, it became apparent through behaviours! \nCognitive mapping revealed that tutors\u2019 avatars interacting with students\u2019 avatars \nwithin the immersive SL environment created an equal relationship, breaking down the old \ntutor-student hierarchical relationship. Again, although this is a known phenomenon in text-\nbased environments, it was most marked and happened quickly in SL. One tutor explained \nthat SL enabled the students and tutors to move away from traditional structures (buildings, \nclassrooms), timetables, rules and regulations and modes of teaching and learning so typical \nof the higher education environment, to a new approach. The development of equal \nrelationships, where preconceptions about who is who change, contribute to the start of a \n\u2018virtual third culture\u2019 at the online socialisation stage (Salmon 2002). \n Stage 3: Information exchange \nThe experience of information exchange in SL is rather different from that in the original 5-\nstage model although the key features remain. In SL it is characterised by questions and \nresponses occurring in rapid successions similar to that occurring in instant messaging \nforums, but with much more context from avatars\u2019 gestures and movements and reference to \nartefacts in the SL space. The conversation pattern is similar to that which occurs in face-to-\nface meetings rather than on asynchronous bulletin boards.  Conversely, in bulletin boards \nparticipants have the option and time to reflect and compose their responses, but in SL they \nneed to compose their responses and ask questions based on what they already know about \nthe subject under discussion. They need to do this quickly or they will get \u2018left behind\u2019.  \nIn our study, we identified two types of information exchange, both of which are \nfeatures of Stage 3 of the 5-stage model: sharing and recommending information to others \nand helping others to achieve their goals. Box 6 is part of a student discussion that begins \nwith a question \u201cCan you recommend any good places in SL that others can visit?\u201d This is a \ndirect request for information exchange. The students started talking about their encounters \nwith artefacts in SL. They were easily able to ignore the SL moderators\u2019 attempts to get them \nback on track! \nBox 6: Offering information to others \n \n[7:47] Avatar trainer: did anyone find any good places they would like to recommend \nothers to visit before next week? \n[7:47] Avatar facilitator 3: and photo galleries as well \n[7:47] Avatar 5: Alice in wonderland, or the little circus... \n[7:48] Avatar 5: there's a lion to sit on! \n[7:48] Avatar 8: okay, that\u2019s fairly amazing \n[7:48] Avatar 7: did you take a picture? \n[7:48] Avatar 5: no I was too busy sitting on it \n[7:48] Avatar 8: I've seen a dragon! \n[7:49] Avatar 5: can you sit on it? \n[7:49] Avatar trainer: OK.... BACK TO THE CLASSROOM! \n[7:49] Avatar 6: I saw a whale... \n[7:49] Avatar 8: not so sure \n \n In the example in Box 7, the tutor is helping the students, and students are helping \neach other, to navigate around the Kalasha village. \nBox 7: Helping others find their way around the Kalasha village \n[7:46] Avatar 3: I can go up to the mountain top, isn't this limited to men only? \n[7:48] Avatar facilitator 2: in theory you shouldn't be able to go up the mountain top - \nmountains are pure, so for men only \n[7:48] Avatar 3: Can you enter the hut, V? \n[7:48] Avatar facilitator 2: but try and see what your permission lets you do \n[7:48] Avatar 4: I\u2019ll try \n[7:49] Avatar 3: Can I open the door? \n[7:50] Avatar facilitator 1: yep just click on it \n \nStage 4: Knowledge construction \nIn our study, we identified two types of avatar behaviours likely to promote knowledge \nconstruction: collaborations and sharing, i.e. exchanging views and learning from each other \nto achieve a common goal. Unlike text-based environments, SL offers opportunities to build, \ncreate and develop objects collaboratively. Participants found the activity of building and \ndeveloping virtual story cubes very interesting and engaging.  They very much enjoyed the \ngroup support, discussion and negotiation mediated through developing and putting together \ntheir story cubes (Figure 3).  \n \nFigure 3: Student avatars\u2019 develop virtual story cubes collaboratively in SL \n \nThe characteristics of the SL environment led to easy and productive processes and \ngroup work \u2013 qualities that are difficult to reproduce and require more effort to generate in \n text-based asynchronous environments. In Box 8, a group of students discuss and negotiate \non in what shape they should put their story cubes together. \nBox 8: Interacting and contributing towards a common goal \n \n[6:31] Avatar 8: how should we put them together? What shape? \n[6:31] Avatar 5: circle, so we can walk round it easily \n[6:31] Avatar 7: yep \n[6:31] Avatar 8: the viewer stands in the middle? Or outside? \n[6:31] Avatar 5: or a semi circle? \n[6:31] Avatar 9: good idea \n[6:31] Avatar 10: yeah a circle \n[6:31] Avatar 5: clever \n[6:31] Avatar 7: in the middle \n[6:31] Avatar 8: I'd go for middle \n[6:31] Avatar 8: let's do it \n[6:32] Avatar 5: and won\u2019t it be FUN to see the story on the outside!! \n[6:32] Avatar 8: I\u2019m gonna start with a wonky circle \n[6:32] Avatar trainer: should we all stand in the middle as you build it around us? \n[6:33] Avatar 10: yes good idea\u2026H...I think I am in the middle now \n[6:33] Avatar 6: looks very professional Avatar 4! \n[6:35] Avatar 8: now you think about the order \n \nBoxes 9 and 10 demonstrate the need to create appropriate conditions for the smooth \nand regular flow of engagement and interchange. In Box 9, the SL-moderator facilitated \nknowledge construction through asking questions, promoting new topics, seeking more \ndiscussion and encouraging controversial views.  \nBox 9: E-moderating skills for facilitating knowledge construction in SL \n[7:09] Avatar facilitator 1: Who wants to start \u2013 A? (being alphabetical) \n[7:09] Avatar 3: All three of them, I guess. \n[7:09] Avatar facilitator 1: D - do you agree? \n[7:09] Avatar 2: All three, I suppose. \n[7:10] Avatar facilitator 1: E? Someone start arguing! \n[7:10] Avatar 1: I think it's socially structured, but maybe all three? It's neutral as far as \ngender goes I think. \n[7:10] Avatar 1: It's virtual so it's a little confusing \n[7:10] Avatar facilitator 1: Gender is an interesting one, as it is very easy to be \ntransgender or opposite gender to real life, as we shall see next week \n[7:11] Avatar facilitator 1: Can we think about how far SL conforms to these kinds of \napproaches in turn? \n[7:11] Avatar facilitator 1: As far as I can experience it, SL uses Cartesian coordinates, \nso in that sense it tries to mimic the real world rather than do anything more creative \n[7:12] Avatar 3: But the same time it's three-dimensional, measurable and quantifiable. \n \n In Box 10, the students achieved knowledge construction through following up each \nother\u2019s questions, keeping the discussion growing, and sharing and exchanging views. \nBox 10: Knowledge construction through sharing and exchanging views in SL \n \n[7:40] Avatar facilitator 2: ok, end of that PowerPoint - any questions about burial? \n[7:41] Avatar 3: Any differences between men and women? \n[7:41] Avatar facilitator 2: good question - no difference between men and women for \nactual burial, but the ancestor statues tend to be of men \n[7:42] Avatar trainer: Do they use different woods\/components depending on \nprestige\/status of the person buried? The pictures I saw (you showed me)... all look the \nsame? \n[7:42] Avatar 3: Or colours on the statues? \n[7:43] Avatar facilitator 2: yes, interesting point - wood today in the Kalasha valleys is \nin short supply - deforestation by the Kalasha \n[7:43] Avatar 4: is the depth of burial very little as in European Muslim cemeteries \n[7:43] Avatar facilitator 2: this means that any wood that can be found is used, and also \nmeans that the production of ancestor statues is dying out \n[7:43] Avatar 1: Is that why they don't use coffins? The small supply of wood? \n[7:43] Avatar 3: Have they started using different material for the statues? \n[7:44] Avatar facilitator 2: and because wood rots away quite quickly when exposed, \nwe don't really know so much about what happened some year ago, only very recent \nburials \n[7:44] Avatar facilitator 2: V first - the traditional burials and 'buried' - the coffins are \nplaced above ground, and you'll see this in the photos next week \n[7:44] Avatar 4: understood \n[7:45] Avatar facilitator 2: E - the bodies are place in wooden 'coffins' and this is the \ntraditional practice, the coffins are then just left above ground to rot away \n[7:45] Avatar 1: I see, thanks. \n[7:45] Avatar facilitator 2: however, recently Muslim practices are starting to prevail \nand bodies are having to be buried according to Muslim traditions \n[7:46] Avatar facilitator 2: A - interesting idea, but I haven't seen any trend at all to \nmake statues out of different material. I will look out for this if I go there again soon \nthough \n[7:46] Avatar 3: OK, then \nStage 5: Development \nThe example in Box 11 shows that students and tutors reflected on their experience of SL \n(towards the end of a learning session) and the similarities and differences towards the end of \na teaching session. They were able to take a meta cognitive view of their learning through the \n3D world. \nBox 11: Reflecting on personal experience in SL \n \n[4:26] Avatar facilitator 4: what do you think you have learnt about virtual identity \nfrom your experience in SL? \n[4:26] Avatar facilitator 5: I hope we all go on adventuring in SL \n [4:26] Avatar facilitator 4: So do I \n[4:27] Avatar facilitator 5: It has changed a lot for me. A whole new world has \nopened up for new teaching and research \n[4:27] Avatar 11: I think it's just like real life, but the difference is you can make it \ndifferent \n[4:27] Avatar facilitator 4: why not change in real life? Maybe you will now \n[4:28] Avatar facilitator 5: I\u2019m working in New York and having fun in SL with all \nof you. I\u2019m here but I\u2019m there too. Multiple spatiality \n[4:29] Avatar 12: I think I've got more chance to do something that I can\u2019t do or no \nchance to do in real life \n \nIn the final stage of Salmon\u2019s model participants aim to achieve personal goals and \nattempt to integrate their learning experience from the online environment into other forms of \nlearning. There is potential for sophisticated individual learning at this stage.  \nSummary and recommendations \nOur initial study shows that using a structured model for scaffolding learning in groups has \nvalue in 3-D MUVEs such as SL as well as in text-based asynchronous environments, to \nensure that for learners, and teachers, confidence in the environment and in each other builds \nup in a productive way.  The basic structure appears to hold good (see Figure 4), but the \npotential at each stage is slightly different. \n  \nFigure 4: Model of teaching and learning in Second Life \n \nThere is no need to separate the activities that support learning to benefit from using \nthe technological platform from those needed to undertake course-related tasks and \nestablishing a constructive learning group.  Of course, at present SL is more alien to some \nparticipants than bulletin boards are, and they need support and practice. This is an echo for \nmany of us of how it was in the early days of bulletin boards! The key aim for SL- \nmoderators should be to enable each student to become comfortable in his or her avatar\u2019s \nidentity and \u2018at home\u2019 in the SL environment. Then the participants will learn to relate well \nand early with each other through their avatars. We noted that this is somewhat easier in SL \nand occurs more naturally through experience of interaction, once basic skills are acquired, \nthan through asynchronous bulletin boards. However, learning designers should avoid \nmissing out on the critical \u2018online socialisation\u2019 stage \u2013 it provides the building blocks in the \nscaffold for much more group learning later on.  \n Next steps  \nWe are continuing to research into both SL activities (SL-tivities) and the social scaffolding \nof learning in SL, with on-campus and distance learners, through further studies focussed on \nthe students\u2019 learning experience and the use of SL in established programmes of study, as in \nour projects DUCKLING (Delivering University Curricula: Knowledge, Learning and \nINnovation Gains, http:\/\/www.le.ac.uk\/beyonddistance\/duckling) and SWIFT (Second World \nImmersive Future Teaching,  http:\/\/www2.le.ac.uk\/projects\/swift\/swift). We plan to continue \nto illuminate the benefits of the 5-stages for SL and other Web 2.0 environments, and invite \nother teachers and researchers to explore these ideas and send us feedback on their findings. \nNote: *The names of all avatars have been replaced by numbers to respect their anonymity \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank the following organisations, institutions and individuals for funding, participating in and \ncontributing to the development of the 5-stage model: The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) in the \nUK for funding the MOOSE study; Colleagues at Beyond Distance Research Alliance, the University of \nLeicester, especially Professor David Hawkridge, Simon Kear and Matthew Wheeler; Dr Mark Pluciennik, Dr \nRuth Young, Dr Gillian Youngs and Dr Tracy Simmons at the University of Leicester, Dr Paula Roush at the \nLondon South Bank University; Student participants from the University of Leicester and the London South \nBank University. \n \nReferences \n \nBryson, J.M., Ackermann, F., Eden, C. and Fin, C.
