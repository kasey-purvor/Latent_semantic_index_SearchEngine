INTRODUCTION\nTesting for, and quantifying scaling is central to the\napplication of statistical theories to \u2018real-world\u2019 extended\nsystems. A broad range of theoretical frameworks such as\nturbulence [1], critical phenomena [2] and complex sys-\ntems [3] frame their predictions in terms of the statistical\nproperties of (arbitrarily large) ensembles as a function\nof scale. Under the assumption of ergodicity the statis-\ntical scaling property of an extended system is captured\nto some extent by a reduced (embedded) set of observa-\ntions or measurements; so that a 1-D cut through a N\ndimensional system will be sufficient to indicate whether\nscaling is present, and in a quantitative way can usefully\nrestrict the scaling exponents of the system as a whole.\nThis approach is pragmatic \u2013 in physical systems it is\ngenerally not practicable to capture and analyze the full\nspatiotemporal information of all points in the system on\nall scales. A key observable is then the quantitative scal-\ning properties of such a one dimensional sample or time\nseries. An example of this is the use of the Taylor hy-\npothesis in turbulence, where the time series at a single\npoint is used as a proxy for the statistical properties of\nthe flow [4].\nTime series are also often parsed into sub-intervals to\nisolate processes of interest, or to remove features which\nmight contaminate the calculation of the quantity of in-\nterest. Examples of this in the study of solar wind tur-\nbulence are the separating of fast and slow wind, and\nopen\/closed field line regions [5, 6]; isolating or removing\nsignals of interplanetary shocks, magnetosheath cross-\n\u2217Electronic address: k.kiyani@warwick.ac.uk\nings, and coronal mass ejection remnants [7, 8]; or where\nthe interval is restricted by a secular change in parame-\nters as the spacecraft changes location [9, 10]. Examples\nin the study of the earth\u2019s geomagnetic field include iso-\nlating \u2018quasi-stationary\u2019 and \u2018quiet\u2019 intervals in magnetic\nfield data [6, 11]; and the effects of finite sample size in\nthe power spectral exponent estimates in the ionosphere\nby ground-based measurements [12]. \u2018Locally station-\nary processes\u2019 are also discussed in speech signal analysis\n[13] and physiological non-stationary signals [14]; and of\ncourse statistical forecasting, whether in the context of\nseasonal weather or the financial markets [15], is based\non time series histories which rely on the stationarity as-\nsumption. In all of these cases, it is intuitively apparent\nthat smaller data intervals will result in poorer statistics,\nwhich will be manifest in the variance of the observed val-\nues of the exponents. The observation of a (non-secular)\nvariation in the scaling exponents therefore has two in-\nterpretations; either it is due to intrinsic fluctuations as\na result of the finite N interval, or it is a consequence of\nnon-time stationarity of the time series x(t) i.e. different\nscaling behaviour due to different physical phenomena.\nIf the properties of the underlying process are not known\na priori we need a method to distinguish these two in-\nterpretations in a quantitative manner; or at best to put\na degree of confidence that it is due to one and not the\nother.\nThe most commonly used tool to both establish and\nquantify scaling in a time series x(t) is to test for scal-\ning of the power spectral density F (\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9\u2212\u03b2 , and ob-\ntain the exponent \u03b2. In a physical system, such scal-\ning can only be observed over a finite range, limited by\nthe interval (in time t) of N observations over which the\nsystem is measured. From large-sample theory (asymp-\ntotic limit of N \u2192 \u221e) the variance in the power spec-\n2tral exponent \u03b2 computed using least squares regression\nfrom an interval of N samples is known [16, 17] for fi-\nnite variance processes to vary as \u223c 1\/N as N \u2192 \u221e.\nOne method to obtain more complete information about\nthe scaling properties of a stochastic process x(t) is cap-\ntured by how the statistical properties of the increments\ny(t, \u03c4) = x(t+\u03c4)\u2212x(t) vary with the differencing scale \u03c4 ;\nthe differencing being a particular type of coarse-graining\noperation which has been chosen due to the easy analogy\nwith random walks, return probabilities etc. However,\nthere exist other coarse-graining operations which al-\nthough more involved, possess additional highly desirable\nproperties when studying scaling. In particular, wavelets\nwhich (with some wavelet functions) when combined with\ntheir detrending capabilities have been shown to be a\nnatural and computationally efficient way of studying\nscale-by-scale statistical behaviour [13, 18, 19]. In this\npaper we will discuss the behaviour of the scaling prop-\nerties of the second order moment\n\u2329\ny(t, \u03c4)2\n\u232a \u223c \u03c4\u03b6(2). We\nmay anticipate that the statistical properties of this scal-\ning exponent \u03b6(2) follow that of \u03b2; indeed there exist\nmany results for a range of different estimators of the\n\u03b6(2) [20, 21] that directly show the asymptotic \u223c 1\/N\nbehaviour discussed above. In practice, the convergence\nto this \u223c 1\/N behaviour will depend on the details of the\nprocess and the estimator and, as we shall show in this\npaper, is often slow.\nAn essential tool in the analysis of \u2018real world\u2019 time se-\nries in the context of scaling is then a prescription for the\nvariance in the scaling exponents of x(t) as a function of\nthe number of observations N in the chosen interval. In\nthis paper we make some first steps in this direction by\nobtaining empirical estimates from the study of a vari-\nety of stochastic processes that have been used as models\nfor physical systems. We focus on finite size N realiza-\ntions of self-affine cases with Gaussian distributed incre-\nments in the form of a standard Brownian motion and\nfractional Brownian motion (fBm); and those with heavy\ntails, namely \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy motion and linear fractional\nstable motion (LFSM) [22\u201324]. A representative case\nfor multifractal scaling is provided by the p-model, often\nused to characterize observations of turbulence [25, 26].\nThe fundamental property of ergodicity in systems\nthat exhibit scaling implies time stationarity. In its\nstrong sense time stationarity implies that the proba-\nbility density function (PDF) of x(t) does not change\nwith time; this is known as strict stationarity. Pragmat-\nically, weak stationarity, that is time independence of\nthe variance or second order moment is usually adopted\n\u2013 the latter convenience is usually assumed due to the\nspecial place that the Central Limit Theorem and the\nGaussian distribution hold in statistics. In this paper we\nare concerned specifically with the behaviour of scaling\nexponents which are characterized through the statisti-\ncal properties of the increments y(t, \u03c4), rather than the\ntime series x(t); hence we will use as our test time se-\nries examples that have stationarity in y(t, \u03c4), and not in\nx(t).\nWe will focus on the statistics of the scaling exponent\nof the second order moment of the increments, as this\nalso captures the power spectral exponent \u03b2, and for self-\naffine finite-variance processes the Hurst exponentH (see\nnext section and also [27] for the infinite variance case).\nWe will study these processes for a range of values of N\nthat are feasable for realisable physical systems; and find\nthat in particularly for the heavy-tailed processes, the\nvariance in the exponent with N shows a significant de-\nparture from the 1\/N asymptotic behaviour. Neverthe-\nless, for these heavy-tailed processes, we find empirical\nevidence of an intermediate range of scaling with N\u2212\u03b3 .\nWe will estimate the time series interval N required to\ncapture the scaling exponent to reasonable precision; this\nplaces a lower limit on the sample size. A related study\nto this was conducted to investigate and compare the\neffects of finite sample size on different statistical esti-\nmators for the Hurst exponent H for a Gaussian white\nnoise process [28]. Stationarity also implies a particu-\nlar PDF of the values of the exponent obtained from\nmany, length N , realisations of a given process. This is\nknown asymptotically forN \u2192\u221e for the processes based\non Gaussian increments (generalizable to finite variance\nprocesses) and is also known in this asymptotic sense\nfor infinite variance processes; both processes approach-\ning a Gaussian distribution for the scaling exponents as\nN \u2192 \u221e [16, 17, 20, 24, 29, 30] (using least squares and\nmaximum likelihood estimation schemes). For the inter-\nmediate stage of finite N we find intermediate distribu-\ntions for the exponents; resembling both the asymptotic\nGaussian forms and, for heavy-tailed data, Gumbel max-\nstable (Extreme value type I) distributions. Comparing\nthese results with that found for real-world time series\nmay provide an additional test for stationarity in the in-\ncrements. In this spirit we finally illustrate these ideas\nwith some examples of real-world time series in the form\nof in-situ observations of magnetic field and velocity in\nthe turbulent solar wind using data from spacecraft at\n1AU in the ecliptic; and comment on the statistical prop-\nerties of their scaling exponents in light of the represen-\ntative synthetic toy models.\nII. METHODOLOGY\nWe will focus attention on the scaling exponent \u03b6(2) of\nthe second order moment of the increments also known\nas the second order structure function:\u2329\ny(t, \u03c4)2\n\u232a\n=\n\u2329\n(x(t + \u03c4)\u2212 x(t))2\n\u232a\n=\n\u2329\ny(t, 1)2\n\u232a\n\u03c4\u03b6(2) , (1)\nwhere we have assumed that the increment process is at\nleast second order stationary i.e.\n\u2329\ny(t, \u03c4)2\n\u232a\n=\n\u2329\ny(\u03c4)2\n\u232a\n(weak-stationarity). In particular, this implies that the\npower spectral density of a discrete time random walk\nx(t) of i.i.d. stationary increments with finite variance,\nscales as [13]\nF (\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9\u2212(\u03b6(2)+1) , (2)\n3where the scaling exponent \u03b6(2) is related to the power\nspectral exponent \u03b2 of x(t) by \u03b6(2) = \u03b2\u22121. For self-affine\nprocess with Hurst exponent H the PDF P (y, \u03c4) of the\nincrements obeys the scaling relation (for the case of \u03b1-\nstable processes with finite N see [27], and the discussion\nto follow)\nP (y, \u03c4) = \u03c4\u2212HPs(\u03c4\u2212Hy) , (3)\nwhere the PDF P at any scale \u03c4 can be collapsed onto\na unique scaling function Ps. The scaling relation (3)\nimplies that the scaling of the structure functions to all\norders p [27] is given by \u3008y(\u03c4)p\u3009 = \u3008y(1)p\u3009 \u03c4\u03b6(p) where\n\u03b6(p) = Hp; and thus we have that \u03b6(2) = 2H . Our\nresults concerning the statistical behaviour of \u03b6(2) with\nN will thus also apply to the power spectral exponent\n\u03b2 for all the models concerned and the Hurst exponent\nH for the self-affine models; both are commonly used\nto characterize statistical scaling. Our remarks can also\nbe generalized to the scaling exponents \u03b6(p) of structure\nfunctions of higher-order positive moments. These are\nrelevant for multifractal processes where the \u03b6(p) are a\nnonlinear function of p and so H or \u03b2 are not sufficient to\ndetermine the complete statistical scaling of the y(t, \u03c4).\nOur study consists of partitioning a given time series\nx(t) into L equal intervals of sample size N denoted by\nxi(t) where i = 1 . . . L. Each of these intervals are then\ndifferenced on scale \u03c4 to produce a time series of the\nincrements yi(t, \u03c4) = xi(t+\u03c4)\u2212xi(t) of the process xi(t).\nWe will look for scaling of the second order moment\n(structure function)\nM2i (\u03c4) =\n\u2329\nyi(\u03c4)\n2\n\u232a\n=\n\u222b y+\ni\ny\u2212\ni\ny2iPi(yi, \u03c4)dyi , (4)\nwith \u03c4 such that M2i (\u03c4) = M\n2\ni (1)\u03c4\n\u03b6i(2). Again, the in-\ndex i indicates the ith interval over which the exponents\nare calculated and tracks any (real or statistical) time\nvariation in the value of \u03b6i(2). In an infinitely large in-\nterval, N \u2192\u221e, the limits of the integral y\u00b1i \u2192 \u00b1\u221e; here\nhowever each ith interval of the time series will impose\ndifferent finite extremal values y\u00b1i . For the heavy-tailed\nprocesses in particular, the statistics of the y\u00b1i can be\nanticipated to have a significant effect on the statistics of\nthe \u03b6i(2); this has been discussed for the case of \u03b1- sta-\nble Le\u00b4vy processes in [27]. These Le\u00b4vy processes, possess\nheavy tails in the PDFs of their increments, with tails\nthat fall as P (y) \u223c y\u2212(1+\u03b1) power-laws. The \u03b1-stable\nLe\u00b4vy processes have divergent moments for p = 2 and\nabove; for a finite sized sample the moments exist but can\nbe dominated by the behaviour of rare outlying points in\nthe tails which introduce a pathological bias when es-\ntimating scaling exponents from the moments [27] (for\na wider discussion see [31]). We circumvent these diffi-\nculties, at least for self-affine time series, by restricting\nour analysis to the scaling of the second order moment\n\u03b6(2), and by using the iterative conditioning technique\n[27]. This simple and robust technique for exponent es-\ntimation removes a small percentage of the extreme data\nvalues which are poorly sampled statistically. In some\npathological cases such as the \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy distributions\nthese rare extreme points are of the order of and some-\ntimes larger than the whole sum [32]. Because they are\nso large they tend to dominate the statistics and thus the\nscaling of the higher order moments. This can be clearly\nseen if we look at the discrete definition of the moments\nof order p\nMpi (\u03c4) =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nj=1\n(ypi )j . (5)\nThe reasoning and full illustration of this iterative condi-\ntioning method to heavy-tailed non-Gaussian distribu-\ntions is discussed in [27]. Although not discussed in\nthis paper, the iterative conditioning technique is also\nan unbiased robust technique for distinguishing self-affine\n(monofractal) from multifractal behaviour.\nWe will focus here on parameter stationarity as op-\nposed to trend stationarity. The former refers to the\nchange in the intrinsic dynamics of the process of interest\nas characterized by its quantitative statistical properties\n(the behaviour of the moments); as opposed to the latter\nwhich is simply an additive trend to the signal. In partic-\nular we will focus on the stationarity of the scaling of the\nmoments as captured by the exponents \u03b6i(p). If secular\ntrends are present in the time series then the time series\nof increments will be approximately trend-free provided\nour differencing scale \u03c4 is sufficiently small [33]. A sec-\nular trend can also be removed by detrending or by the\nmethod of studying the scaling of moments of wavelet\ncoefficients where an appropriate wavelet is chosen with\na large number of zero-moments [19, 34]. The more com-\nplex case of mixed dynamics i.e. two or more intrinsically\ndifferent processes represented in different sections of a\ntime series will not be considered here.\nA. Data generation and sources\nWe will consider synthetically generated signals that\nare both stationary and nonstationary with respect to\ntheir increments. The signals with stationary indepen-\ndent increments will consist of a standard Brownian mo-\ntion and standard symmetric \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy motion for\nfour values of the exponent \u03b1 [22, 35]; the latter being\nhighly non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed with very large ex-\ncursions in their time series. To survey a broad range\nof such processes we have also included non-Markovian\nversions of the above processes. These include a long-\nmemory fractional Brownian motion (fBm), and a long-\nmemory persistent and anti-persistent linear fractional\nstable motion (LFSM) \u2013 see [17, 22\u201324] for more details\non these processes and in particular [24] for the algorithm\nand MATLAB code for the LFSM.\nWe also investigate a multifractal time series generated\nfrom a discrete multiplicative cascade process in the form\nof the p-model [25, 26]. The p-model is used as a model\n4for intermittent turbulence [1, 36]. The intermittency\nof the p-model time series leads to non-time stationary\nfinite N moments; however the set of scaling exponents\n\u03b6i(p) are stationary.\nThe nonstationary time series we will consider are a\nstandard Brownian motion with linearly varying stan-\ndard deviation of its increments with time \u03c3 \u223c t, and\ncyclically varying standard deviation (cyclically station-\nary) \u03c3 \u223c sin2(t). All of the above synthetic time series\nwere generated in MATLAB with appropriate random\nseeding and sample sizes of N \u223c 106.\nLastly, we will consider three real-world time series\nwhich have been found to exhibit scaling [37\u201340]. These\nconsist of two time series of 100 second resolution mag-\nnetic field Bz and speed v from the NASA WIND space-\ncraft at 1AU in the solar minimum year 1996; and a 64\nsecond resolution one year long time series of the mag-\nnetic field energy density B2 from the NASA ACE space-\ncraft in the solar maximum year 2000. All of these time\nseries consist of N \u223c 5 \u00d7 105 data samples and can be\ndownloaded from CDA web http:\/\/cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.\ngov\/.\nIII. RESULTS\nWe study the variation of the scaling exponent of the\nsecond order moment \u03b6i(2) with sample size N . The\nprocess by which the exponent \u03b6i(2) is estimated for L\ncontiguous intervals of N points of a time series is illus-\ntrated in Figure 1 for the p-model. We begin with the\ntime series in Figure 1(a) which we parse into L inter-\nvals. For each of these intervals we obtain an estimate of\n\u03b6i(2) as the gradient of a linear least squares regression\nto a log-log plot of the second-order moment M2i (\u03c4) ver-\nsus the scale or differencing parameter \u03c4 . This method\nof obtaining the scaling exponents is also known as the\nstructure function technique [1, 5] and is closely related\nto variance plot, correlogram and log-periodogram tech-\nniques [17, 30] \u2013 in the latter reference [30] it is identical\nto the variogram technique. We focus on this particu-\nlar method to estimate \u03b6i(2) as it provides a point of\ncontact with asymptotic N \u2192 \u221e estimates of the vari-\nance of the power spectral exponent \u03b2 which are based\non linear regression over a finite range power law power\nspectrum [16, 17]. In both cases, the variance in the\nestimated exponent will depend upon the details of the\nlinear regression. For the second order moment these de-\ntails include the range of values of \u03c4 over which M2i (\u03c4)\nis a power law; the number of different \u03c4 for which we\ncalculate M2i (\u03c4) and use in the linear regression; and the\nuncertainty of each M2i (\u03c4) value. In all cases considered\nhere we optimize these details to minimize the linear re-\ngression error but importantly use the same algorithm\nfor all of the sample time series that we discuss.\nThe linear fit is obtained by linear least-squares regres-\nsion which also provides an estimate of the error. We\naugment this estimate of the error by varying the start\nand end points of the regression by a few points and ob-\ntaining the difference in the exponents. The linear regres-\nsion was done over \u223c 20 values of the scale parameter \u03c4 ,\nwhere \u03c4 was increased geometrically as \u03c4 = basek, where\nk \u2208 {0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 40} and base was chosen to be 1.2. The fit\nwas done over this reduced set of measurements at \u223c 20\nvalues of \u03c4 so that a fair comparison can be made with\nthe real-world data (to be discussed later) where only a\nlimited power-law range is seen.\nDue to its highly intermittent nature the p = 0.6 p-\nmodel is not time stationary in its finite N moments and\nthis can be seen in Figure 1(b) where we plot consecutive\nvalues of the second order moment M2i (\u03c4) obtained for\neach of the L intervals of N points, shown for \u03c4 = 1 and\ntwo values of N . For the p-model time series shown here,\nthe second order moment follows the local amplitude of\nfluctuations in the time series itself; comparing the ratio\nof the amplitude of these fluctuations to the signal am-\nplitude is one of the classical \u2018first base\u2019 techniques for\nestablishing whether the signal is stationary (in the weak\nsense)[33]. As one would expect from (5), this variation\nof the second-order moment M2i (\u03c4) with the amplitude\nof the time series is emphasized as we decrease N as any\nestimates of the statistics from smaller sample size will\nnaturally mimic the more local features of the time series.\nThis behaviour is more pronounced in very intermittent\nsignals i.e. those with heavy-tailed fluctuation PDFs.\nWe also plot in Figures 1(c) and (d) the correspond-\ning estimates of \u03b6i(2) for each interval. These two panels\nshow the same data, that is, the estimates of \u03b6i(2) plot-\nted without (c) and with (d) error bars obtained from\nthe linear regression and the error augmentation outlined\nabove. As intuitively expected, if we decrease the sample\nsize N over which the \u03b6i(2) are computed, the scatter\nincreases. However unlike the moments, there is no clear\ntrend with the amplitude of the signal, indicating sta-\ntionarity of the scaling exponent \u03b6i(2). This latter phe-\nnomenon will also be encountered in the non-stationary\nBrownian time series we will study. The estimates of\n\u03b6i(2) can be seen to vary by up to a factor of two for\nN = 104 for this realization of the p-model. This under-\nlies the difficulty of obtaining physically meaningful es-\ntimates of scaling exponents for physically realizable N .\nWe can see that the error bars approximately capture the\nfluctuations in the estimates of \u03b6i(2) for the case of the\np-model. As we wish to include strongly non-Gaussian\nprocesses in our study, we will henceforth present numer-\nical estimates of the variance of \u03b6i(2) obtained directly\nfrom computing many values of \u03b6i(2) rather than the lin-\near regression error.\nThe essential point is that quite significant variation\nin the scaling exponents can arise in time stationary, but\nintermittent, time series; even when these are estimated\nover intervals of data that might intuitively be considered\nto be of adequate length. In order to distinguish variation\nin the scaling exponents that is statistical (finiteN effect)\nas shown above, from that which reflects intrinsic non-\ntime stationarity, some estimate of the N dependence\n50\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nM\ni2\n(\u03c4\n=\n1\n)\n \n \nN=10\n5\nN=10\n4\n!\n\"!\n#!\n$!\n%!\n&!!\n&\"!\n&#!\n'\n()\n*+\n('\n(,\n-.\n\/\n*+\n0\n-\n-\n1!23456-+*25-05(*50\n718!9$:-;8&!\n$\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n\u03b6\ni(\n2\n)\n \n \n<\u03b6\n2\n> for N=10\n4\n<\u03b6\n2\n> for N=10\n6\n<\u03b6\n2\n> for N=10\n5\n\u03b6\n2\n for N=10\n4\n\u03b6\n2\n for N=10\n5\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nx 10\n5\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n0.22\n0.24\ntime\n\u03b6\ni(\n2\n)\n \n \na.)\nb.)\nc.)\nd.)\nx105\nFigure 1: (Color online) a.)

The vertical\nblack dashed lines indicate the areas outside of which errors\nbegin to dominate due to i.) (bottom vertical line) lack of\nvalues of \u03b6i(2) to make a decent estimate of V ar(\u03b6(2)); and\nii.) (top vertical line) failure of the iterative conditioning\ntechnique to obtain unbiased estimates of \u03b6(2).\nof the variance of \u03b6(2) is needed; this will also point to\nan estimate of the minimum number of observations N\nneeded to obtain a \u2018reasonably accurate\u2019 estimate of \u03b6(2).\nWe will now explore the variance of \u03b6(2) as a function of\nN .\nIn the limit N \u2192 \u221e, \u03b2, when estimated via a log-\nperiodogram varies as V ar[\u03b2] \u223c 1\/N [16, 17]. This lim-\niting behaviour is also known for some other estimation\nschemes of the self-similarity parameter [20] (as we dis-\ncuss later here). Thus we would anticipate that for suffi-\nciently largeN , V ar[\u03b6i(2)] \u223c 1\/N for our moment scaling\nestimation also. However, we do not know the rate of con-\nvergence with N to this limiting behaviour and can also\n6anticipate that this will depend upon whether the PDF\nof the increments is heavy-tailed, and whether or not the\nincrements are dependent \u2013 both of which introduce fur-\nther difficulties in obtaining an unbiased estimator.\nIn Figure 2 we plot the variance of \u03b6i(2) against the\nsample size N on log-log axes, for a range of N that are\nfeasable in realistic realizations of physical systems. Fig-\nure 2(a) shows the behaviour of a subset of our synthetic\ntime series that are intrinsically finite variance processes;\nFigure 2(b) shows all the synthetic time series from infi-\nnite variance processes that we consider. Plotting these\non log-log axes reveals a characteristic power law trend\nfor all the processes:\nV ar[\u03b6(2)] = CN\u2212\u03b3 . (6)\nWe see that indeed, \u03b3 \u223c 1 for the intrinsically finite vari-\nance processes. More pragmatically, we can use this plot\nto make an estimate of the minimum sample size Nmin\nneeded in order to estimate \u03b6(2) such that the error in-\ntroduced from the small sample size N = Nmin is, say,\n\u223c 5%. We propose a simple criterion\u221a\nV ar[\u03b6(2)]\n\u03b6(2)|L=1 . 0.05 , (7)\nwhere \u03b6(2)|L=1 is the value of \u03b6(2) estimated for the en-\ntire time series (assuming that the scaling is stationary).\nThis leads to\nV ar[\u03b6(2)] . (0.05\u03b6(2)|L=1)2 , (8)\nwhere the value of Nmin is extrapolated from the plot\nof V ar[\u03b6(2)] Vs. N , from Figure 2(a). For these finite\nvariance processes expressions (7) and (8) yield Nmin \u223c\n103 for the fBm model; Nmin \u223c 104 for the standard\nBrownian motion (stationary and non-stationary); and\nNmin \u223c 105 for the the p-model.\nOne can invert these relationships to obtain the ap-\nproximate error on \u03b6i(2) given a sample size N from\nwhich it was calculated. The constant C in (6) is also\nintrinsic to our estimate of Nmin; operationally the pro-\ncedure for obtaining the error on \u03b6i(2) in this manner\nwould also include estimating C from the plot in Figure\n2(a).\nProcesses that show scaling often have increments\ndrawn from a heavy tailed PDF, these may also not\nintrinsically have finite variance as is the case for the\n\u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy processes. Figure 2(b) shows the N de-\npendence of all the infinite variance synthetic time series\nthat we have considered, including those with long-range\nmemory. The curves are all generated from time series\nwhich possess heavy-tailed PDFs for their increments.\nThese include both the ordinary and fractional Le\u00b4vy in-\ncrements. The curves in Figure 2(b) have a range of \u03b3\nvalues close to but also clearly distinct from \u03b3 = 1. As\nwill be discussed later this is due to slow convergence to\nthe asymptotic N\u22121 behaviour; from Figure 2(b) we can\nsee that the Le\u00b4vy process which is closest to Gaussian,\nnamely with \u03b1 = 1.8, has behaviour closest to \u03b3 \u223c 1. In a\nsimilar way to the method used above for the finite vari-\nance synthetic processes, we make empirical estimates of\nNmin required to obtain an estimate of \u03b6(2) to within\n\u223c 5% for the infinite variance processes. For the Le\u00b4vy\nprocesses \u03b1 = 1.2 and \u03b1 = 1.4, and LFSM (H = 0.44,\n\u03b1 = 1.4) Nmin \u223c 105; for the \u03b1 = 1.6 case Nmin \u223c 104;\nand for the \u03b1 = 1.8 case and LFSM (H = 0.9, \u03b1 = 1.6)\nNmin \u223c 103. The relevant property in the context of es-\ntimating the uncertainty on \u03b6i(2) is that for realizableN ,\nthese processes do not show an N\u22121 dependence. Also,\nunlike the Gaussian processes in Figure 2(a) which cluster\naround a similar C value, the infinite variance processes\nhave noticeably different values of C which depends on\nboth the the tail exponent \u03b1 and also on the degree of\nmemory in the process given by H \u2212 (1\/\u03b1) [20].\nFinally, combining equations (6) and (8) we obtain\nNmin = C\n1\/\u03b3 (0.05\u03b6(2)|L=1)\u22122\/\u03b3 , (9)\nwhere both C and \u03b3 depend on the process in question;\nand for finite variance processes \u03b3 = 1.\nError analysis\nTo estimate the errors in the estimates of V ar(\u03b6(2))\na small monte-carlo type study was performed in which\ndifferent random seeds were used to generate 10 different\nrealisations of the two archetypal processes studied here\ni.e. finite and infinite variance processes in the form of\n10 different realisations of a standard Brownian motion\nand a standard \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy process (\u03b1 = 1.4). The\ncomputation of the logV ar(\u03b6(2)) Vs. logN plots were\nthen calculated for each of these realisations; these are\nshown in Figures 3(a) and (b). We then average over\nthese realisations to obtain an average value of V ar(\u03b6(2))\nfor eachN , shown on log-log axes in Figures 3(c) and (d);\nthe ensemble of realisations also provides an error on this\nvalue via the maximum deviation from this average.\nAt large N errors are dominated by there being fewer\nvalues of computed \u03b6i(2) and at small N , by poor res-\nolution of the PDF from which we ultimately compute\n\u03b6i(2). In particular, at small N we can see from the plots\nfor the \u03b1-stable processes that there is a systematic de-\nviation from power law behaviour in N . This arises from\na breakdown in the iterative conditioning technique [27]\nat small N .\nIn the next section we will discuss the PDFs of the\nscaling exponents \u03b6i(2) obtained from this study. When\nthese are close to Gaussian, standard Chi-squared distri-\nbutions and F-test techniques could provide methods of\nobtaining errors for values of V ar[\u03b6(2)], even from a sin-\ngle realisation. In this context we should mention the use\nof bootstrap re-sampling methods for providing distribu-\ntions, confidence intervals and statistical significance for\nparameter estimates in situations when one is limited by\na single realisation [41, 42].

Plots c.) and d.) are the mean averages of the realisations in a.) and b.) respectively, where\nthe error bars are calculated from the maximum deviation from this mean in the 10 realisations.\nand consistent properties of such techniques in the case of\nheavy-tailed distributions [43\u201345] and especially infinite-\nvariance processes are still unclear we envisage the use of\nsuch methods in future research.\nFinally, one could in principle increase the available\nnumber of values of \u03b6i(2) by overlapping intervals of size\nN within a given single realisation. We have, however,\nfound that this introduces a significant systematic bias\nin the computed values of V ar[\u03b6(2)].\nReal-world data\nWe calculate V ar[\u03b6(2)] values for the examples of real-\nworld data sets discussed earlier in the introduction. The\nplot detailing this study is shown in Figure 4. For com-\nparison we have also included on this plot the variation\nof V ar[\u03b6(2)] with N for the two archetypal cases of finite\nand infinite variance processes in the form of a standard\nBrownian motion and an \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy process (\u03b1 = 1.4);\nwe also plot a negative unit slope for the asymptotic\nN \u2192 \u221e behaviour obtained from large sample theory,\nthis is indicated by the dashed line. Figure 4 shows that\nthe real-world data can show significant departures from\nthe synthetic data.\nThe WIND data illustrates the effect of large data gaps\nwhich are not present in the ACE data shown; this lim-\nits the amount of data available for certain N which is\nreflected in the corresponding estimations of V ar[\u03b6(2)].\nFor the ACE B2 data we can see a clear systematic de-\nparture from the synthetic models. We will discuss this\nlatter data set in the next section below.\nThe problem with a single length N realisation is that\nwe cannot calculate the errors on V ar[\u03b6(2)] as done in\nthe previous section; and thus have no way of gauging\nhow close these graphs are to the expected asymptotic\nbehaviour predicted by large-sample theory. However,\none can still estimate an error for measurements of \u03b6(2)\nobtained from a finite data size N , in the same way as\nwas done in equations (7)-(9). For example, in the case\nof the ACE B2 data this would indicate that a N \u223c 105\nsample size would introduce an error of \u223c 12% in the\nestimated values of \u03b6(2) using the iteratively conditioned\nmoment scaling technique.\nA.

For\neach of these time series, PDFs have been constructed\nfor two different sample sizes N .

To see\nwhy nearly all of our PDFs corresponding to finite vari-\nance processes are close to Gaussian we appeal to large\nsample-theory.\nTo facilitate understanding we employ more heuristic\narguments at the expense of mathematical rigour. Inter-\nested readers can find more on the mathematical details\nand proofs in [16, 47] which deal with spectral param-\neter estimates of strong long-range dependent Gaussian\nstationary time series; [29] for a non-stationary general-\nization of these; [21] for a pseudo-variogram estimator\n(similar to the method in this paper) to long-range de-\npendent Gaussian processes with stationary increments;\nand the more recent and extensive paper by Stoev, Pipi-\nras and Taqqu [20] which extends the proofs and argu-\nments of [21] to infinite variance processes in the form of\n\u03b1-stable and linear fractional stable processes. This lat-\nter reference will be our main source and point of contact\nfor what follows. A survey of many of these papers and\nparameter estimation techniques can be found in [17].\nAs mentioned above, we have chosen Stoev et. al. [20]\nas a point of contact from amongst the extensive liter-\nature concerning asymptotic large sample behaviour of\nparameter estimates. This is primarily because this work\nhas dealt with infinite variance processes of the type dis-\ncussed here; also our moment scaling technique is a par-\nticular form of one of the main estimators used in [20]\n(see also [21]). We have also used Stoev\u2019s MATLAB\nalgorithm for generating the LFSM realisations used in\nthis paper. Similar to our study Stoev et. al. use a\nleast squares regression on the moments which they refer\nto as the \u2018power\u2019 estimator. However, instead of tak-\ning moments of the increments as we do, they take the\nmoments of coefficients for a Finite Impulse Response\nTransformation (FIRT) of the discrete time-series, which\nis characterised by a discrete filter of n members. Our\nincrements are one of the simplest forms of these FIRT\ncoefficients if we take the filter to be comprised of a set\nof n = 2 members {\u22121, 1}. However, any extra benefits\nof having more than one zero-moment (moments which\nare equal to zero) will be lost due to this simplicity. This\nalso applies to the wavelet coefficients used in the study\nof Stoev et. al. where our increments result from tak-\ning the mother wavelet to be the superposition of two\ndelta functions (one positive, one negative) separated by\na scale \u03c4 \u2013 also known in the literature as the \u2018poor man\u2019s\nwavelet\u2019 [48]. Also, an important fact to note when com-\nparing the methods of Stoev et. al. to ours is that we\ndiffer with the \u2018power\u2019 method of these authors by using\nthe iterative conditioning technique which by censoring\nand excluding the poorly sampled large extreme events,\ncorrect for the bias which is pathological in the case of\nheavy-tailed distributions [27].\nRecall that the second order moment is scaling as\nM2i (\u03c4) = M\n2\ni (1)\u03c4\n\u03b6(2) and we will be estimating \u03b6(2) from\nthe gradient of a log-log plot\nlogM2i (\u03c4) = \u03b6(2) log \u03c4 + logM\n2\ni (1) . (10)\nFor the discrete data the gradient can be estimated via\nleast squares linear regression, and the problem can be\nset out as\nM\n2\nlog = TlogZ+\n1\u221a\nN\n\u01eb , (11)\nwhere\nM\n2\nlog =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\nlogM2i (\u03c41)\n...\nlogM2i (\u03c4k)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (12)\nis the vector of the observations (or dependent variables);\nTlog =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\nlog \u03c41 1\n...\n...\nlog \u03c4k 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (13)\ncontains the vector of the scales (or independent vari-\nables);\nZ =\n(\n\u03b6(2)\nlogM2i (1)\n)\n, (14)\nis the vector of the parameters needed to be estimated;\nand\n\u01eb =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u221a\nN\n(\nlogM2i (\u03c41)\u2212 log M\u02c62i (\u03c41)\n)\n...\u221a\nN\n(\nlogM2i (\u03c4k)\u2212 log M\u02c62i (\u03c4k)\n)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (15)\nis the vector of estimation errors between the sample\nmeasurements and those of the true expected values (de-\nnoted by M\u02c6) for which the scaling relation in (10) actu-\nally holds.

The sample PDF\u2019s are overlaid with Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) model fits of a Normal\ndistribution for a, c and d; and Gumbel max-stable (extreme value type I) fits for b. For both these models \u00b5 is the location\nparameter and \u03c3 is the scale parameter, which for the Normal distribution coincide with the mean and standard deviation.\nThe samples of \u03b6i(2) (varying with time t) from which these PDFs are constructed, are shown in the corresponding inserts of\neach plot.\n10\nthe well known ordinary linear least squares estimator to\nthe parameters as\nZ =\n(\nT\nt\nlogTlog\n)\u22121\nT\nt\nlogM\n2\nlog , (16)\nwhere superscript t represents a matrix transpose. (16)\nis simply a linear combination of the dependent variable\nlogM2i (\u03c4) i.e. a sum, so that for \u03b6i(2) one can write the\nordinary least squares estimate as\n\u03b6i(2) =\nk\u2211\nj=1\naj\n(\nlogM2i (\u03c4j)\n)\n, (17)\nwhere the aj are all the elements of the appropriate vector\nfrom\n(\nT\nt\nlogTlog\n)\u22121\nT\nt\nlog. We will return to this form of\nthe ordinary least squares solution shortly.\nAdapted to the notation used in this paper, Theo-\nrem 3.1 in [20] states that if \u03b6(2) is the FIRT coefficient\nestimator (using least squares regression) for the scal-\ning exponent and \u03b6\u02c6(2) the true expected value; then as\nlimN \u2192\u221e\n\u221a\nN\n(\n\u03b6(2)\u2212 \u03b6\u02c6(2)\n)\n\u2192 N (0, \u03c32) (18)\nwhere N (0, \u03c32) is a Normal distribution with mean 0\nand variance \u03c32. Strictly speaking this theorem requires\nthat the FIRT coefficients obey the following inequality\nbetween the number of zero-moments of the FIRT filter,\nthe self-similarity parameter H and the tail (stability)\nindex \u03b1\nQ > H +\n1\n\u03b1 (\u03b1\u2212 1) , (19)\nwhich in the case of the ordinary Brownian motion and\nthe \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy processes, where H = 1\/\u03b1, generalises\nto\nQ >\n1\n(\u03b1\u2212 1) . (20)\nThe moment scaling scheme based on the raw increments\nhas only one zero moment, hence Q = 1; and as a result,\nexcept for the p-model for which \u03b1 and H are unknown\n(or not applicable), the above inequality does not hold\nfor any of the synthetic models. However as mentioned\nin [21] for Gaussian processes, where in equation (19)\n\u03b1 = 2, the Q = 1 case is sufficient for the above theo-\nrem to hold as long as H < 0.75. For our fBm model\nH = 0.8 and we find that the results of the theorem (18)\nstill hold. Thus we can conjecture that the criterion in\n(19) and (20) can be relaxed a little so that the inequality\nbecomes an approximate inequality. Also, Stoev et. al.\n[20] show via simulations that the estimators continue to\nwork well even when the criterion in (19) and (20) are\nnot satisfied. The essential reason why this criteria was\ninitially introduced, was so that the estimator could dis-\ntinguish between actual long-memory effects and trends\n[21].\nWe now consider the exception that we have found to\nthis behaviour \u2013 that of the infinite variance processes at\nfinite N . We would expect that in the N \u2192\u221e limit the\nresults of the above theorem will also hold for the infinite\nvariance processes. However, we believe that in this case\nthe convergence will be slow and will depend upon the\nnumber of scales \u03c4 that were used to conduct our linear\nleast squares regression.\nWe will now go beyond the above asymptotic argu-\nments to discuss the non-Gaussian intermediate finite N\nbehaviour that we see here in Figure 5 (b-i) and (b-ii).\nRecall the expression for M2i (\u03c4) given in equation (5)\n(for p = 2). We will discuss in detail here the case where\nthe sum in (5) consists of i.i.d. random variables; this\nis the case for some of our synthetic time series \u2013 these\narguments can be developed for other cases. The PDF\nof this sum will by the Central Limit Theorem tend to a\nGaussian and for finite N will probably take the form of\na Pearson \u03c72\u03bd type variable with \u03bd degrees of freedom (see\n[21] for more details). However, for an infinite variance\nprocess, the sum in (5) will be dominated by the largest\nextreme events, which in some cases can be of the order\nof the rest of the sum [32]. This will still be the case even\nwhen we have excluded some of these extreme events due\nto the iterative conditioning scheme. Thus the sum will\nbe distributed as the extreme values of an \u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy\ndistribution \u2013 which is given by a max-stable Freche\u00b4t dis-\ntribution (see [27]). Note that this will be the case for\nany N , even in the asymptotic large N case. Without\ntoo much detail the form of the PDF P\n(\nM2i\n)\nof M2i will\nbe of the type\nP\n(\nM2i\n)\n=\n\u039b\n2 (M2i )\n1+\u03b1\/2\nexp\n(\n\u2212 \u039b\n\u03b1 (M2i )\n\u03b1\/2\n)\n, (21)\nwhere any scale parameters have been absorbed into\nthe \u039b. One can then convert this Freche\u00b4t PDF to a\nPDF P\u02dc\n(\nM2i,log\n)\ncorresponding to the dependent vari-\nable logM2i (\u03c4) in the least squares scheme in (17), which\nunder a simple conservation of probability will be given\nby\nP\u02dc\n(\nM2i,log\n)\n=\n\u039b\n2\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u03b1\n2\nM2i,log \u2212\n\u039b\n\u03b1\nexp\n(\n\u2212\u03b1\n2\nM2i,log\n))\n,\n(22)\nwhich is in the form of a Gumbel extreme value distri-\nbution; this is another max-stable distribution [49]. The\nGumbel max-stable PDF has a long slow exponentially\ndecreasing right tail; this will imply that a sum of ran-\ndom variables such as (17), each distributed with this\nPDF, will eventually tend to a Gaussian distributed ran-\ndom variable, but slowly due to the heavy right tail. This\nthen captures our result in Figures 5 (b-i) and (b-ii), and\nmay also explain why we do not obtain the \u223c N\u22121 be-\nhaviour in the plots of logV ar(\u03b6(2)) Vs. logN for the\n\u03b1-stable Le\u00b4vy cases.\nAs discussed above, for the case of the finite variance\nsynthetic time series the M2i will be well described by a\n11\nGaussian or (more realistically for finite N) a Pearson\n\u03c72\u03bd PDF. In the same way as was done with the infinite\nvariance processes above, it can be shown that the PDF\nof logM2i can be written as a Gumbel min-stable PDF.\nGumbel min-stable PDF\u2019s have long slow exponentially\ndecreasing left tails, which in our case will be limited by\nthe fact that \u03b6(2) > 0. The right tail of Gumbel min-\nstable PDFs is more compact with a rapidly decaying\nexponential tail. Due to the more compact nature of the\nPDF, a sum of logM2i variables will tend to a Gaussian\nunder the Central Limit Theorem much faster than the\ninfinite variance processes above, hence explaining why\nthe PDFs H (\u03b6(2)) for the finite variance processes are\nwell described by a Gaussian.\nFinally, there is the open question of the behaviour of\nthe real-world data. The ACE B2 data PDFs of H (\u03b6(2))\nshow that they can be well described by a Gaussian; how-\never the scaling of V ar(\u03b6(2)) withN using our estimation\nshows a significant deviation from theN\u22121 behaviour im-\nplied by (18). This will be the topic of future work.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have investigated finite-sample size (N) effects on\nquantifying the statistical scaling properties of time se-\nries. We focus on the scaling exponent \u03b6(2) of the vari-\nance or second moment which for a wide class of pro-\ncesses also gives the spectral exponent \u03b2 of the (power\nlaw) power spectrum. If too small a sample size is used\nthen these fluctuations effectively introduce a pseudo-\nnonstationarity in the estimates for the scaling expo-\nnents. To achieve an error in the exponent of less than\n\u223c 5%, we find that the number of data points N needed\nvaries significantly with the details of the underlying pro-\ncess and is in the range of 103 \u2212 105 for the synthetic\nmodels used in this paper. The variance in the exponent\nwhen computed from an interval of N samples is known\nto vary as \u223c 1\/N for N \u2192 \u221e; however, the conver-\ngence to this behaviour will also depend on the details\nof the process and more importantly on the parameter\nestimating technique used. In particular we have shown\nthat heavy tailed processes can be far from this limiting\nbehaviour for observationally realisable N .\nWe have also considered the case where the scaling\nexponents are time independent, but where there is a\nsecular time dependence in other parameters such as the\nstandard deviation. For the case of a Brownian motion,\nthe estimate of the scaling exponent is not affected by\nthis time dependence. It may thus be too premature to\nreject a time series for scaling analysis simply because\nof the non-stationarity of certain parameters i.e. a run-\nning mean or standard deviation. This also highlights the\nneed to distinguish time variation in the moments from\nthat in scaling exponents that are derived from them.\nWe have focussed here on the moment order scaling\ntechnique to calculate the scaling exponents in order to\nhighlight the issue of apparent non-time stationarity. Al-\nthough there exists extensive statistics literature on the\nasymptotic N \u2192 \u221e limit of various estimation tech-\nniques, further work is needed to investigate how these\ndetails pass over to the more pressing and pragmatic need\nfor their implications on quantifying scaling in finite and\nrealisable N -sized samples.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank B.
