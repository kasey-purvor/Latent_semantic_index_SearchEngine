A corrosion probe was used to make in situ linear polarisation resistance\nmeasurements at the spot where Dolly sank. The corrosion rate of wrought iron on the lakebed\nwas estimated to be in the range 0.018\u20130.030 mm year21, which corresponds to a metal loss of\n1.2\u20132.0 mm over the 67 year period; this metal loss is consistent with the condition of the boiler.\nThe effects of microstructure, material composition and water chemistry are considered in detail,\nand it is concluded that the low oxygen content and the low concentration of dissolved solids in\nthe lake water were the underlying causes of the observed corrosion behaviour.\nKeywords: Boiler corrosion, Wrought iron, SL Dolly\nIntroduction\nIn 1962, an old steam launch was recovered from about\n17 m of water at the bottom of Lake Ullswater in\nCumbria. She was later identified as SL Dolly, built in\nabout 1850, and having being restored to working order,\nshe is thought to be the oldest mechanically powered\nvessel still operating with her original machinery.1\nA remarkable part of this story is that when the\nlaunch was brought to the surface after 67 years on the\nlake bed, very little corrosion was found on the boiler. It\nwas still possible to use a spanner to undo the retaining\nnuts holding the inspection cover. The boiler has the\nriveted wrought iron construction used in that period,\nand after some restoration work it was inspected and\ngiven approval to be put back into service. It was then\nsteamed over the next 10 years, until it was eventually\nreplaced with a new steel boiler, built to meet present\nday design requirements.\nThe question is, why did so little boiler corrosion\noccur during the time that the vessel was sunk? Wrought\niron is known to possess excellent resistance to atmo-\nspheric corrosion, as demonstrated by the condition of\nthe Delhi pillar, thought to date back to the 4th century\nAD.2 Similarly, Brunel\u2019s iron ship SS Great Britain,\nlaunched in 1843 and exposed for most of its life to\nseawater, has survived longer than might have been\nexpected if the hull had been built of steel. Could the low\ncorrosion rate of Dolly\u2019s boiler be attributed to the\ninherent corrosion resistance of wrought iron? Indeed, is\nwrought iron really less prone to corrosion than the\ngrades of steel used today?\nA further explanation is that the thin layer of silt that\nhad accumulated on the boiler may have been beneficial\nby reducing the concentration of dissolved oxygen at the\nmetal surface. However, this silt could instead have been\ndetrimental if active sulphate reducing bacteria had been\npresent and the anaerobic conditions had favoured\nmicrobially influenced corrosion.3,4 Other possible\nexplanations for the low corrosion rate are based on\nthe chemical analysis of the lake water, which may\ncontain either a low concentration of a naturally\noccurring corrosion inhibitor5 or heavy metal ions\nderived from the lead mining that had taken place in\nthe area since the 17th century.6\nThe aim of the project described in this article was to\ninvestigate each of these possible theories in detail.\nCorrosion rate measurements were carried out on\nwrought iron samples using a range of experimental\ntechniques, both in the laboratory and in the field, in\norder to determine the most probable explanation for\nthe low rate of corrosion that had been observed.\nMethods\nMaterials\nRather than perform destructive tests on Dolly\u2019s boiler,\ntwo samples of wrought iron from a similar period were\nobtained on which to carry out the corrosion testing.\nThe first of these (WI1) came from a source that was\ndated at 1850, making it very close in age to the boiler.\nSchool of Industrial & Manufacturing Science, Cranfield University,\nBedford MK18 3AU, UK\n*Corresponding author, email m.robinson@cranfield.ac.uk\n\u0001 2005 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining\nPublished by Maney on behalf of the Institute\nReceived 21 January 2005; accepted 31 March 2005\nDOI 10.1179\/174327805X46959 Corrosion Engineering, Science and Technology 2005 VOL 40 NO 2 143\nThe date of the second wrought iron sample (WI2) was\nunknown but from its source it is believed to have been\nproduced earlier. In addition, a sample of ASTM A106\nseamless carbon steel pipe (BS1), which is suitable for\nmodern boiler construction, was tested for comparison.\nThe microstructures of the wrought iron samples were\ninhomogeneous and consisted of equiaxed ferrite grains\nwith variable quantities of elongated slag inclusions, as\nshown in Fig. 1. In general, WI2 had larger ferrite grains\nand more extensive slag inclusions than WI1. The ferrite\ngrains consisted of iron alone, with carbon and other\nelements being undetected; the slag inclusions were\nessentially iron oxide, with additional elements present\nin the case of WI1. The chemical compositions of the\nslag inclusions are shown in Table 1 and the analysis of\nthe ASTM A106 steel is given in Table 2.\nCorrosion testing\nWeight loss measurements\nSpecimens were machined from the two wrought iron\nsamples and A106 steel to give a surface area of 10 cm2\nin each case. The specimens were degreased and\npreweighed to five decimal places of a gram and then\nimmersed in Cranfield tap water in open topped 2 L\ntroughs. An air bubbler was used to aerate one trough, and\nthree replicate specimens of each material were positioned\nequidistantly around the bubbler. A second trough\ncontained non-aerated tap water, such that oxygen was\nreplenished by diffusion from the surface alone, and the\nsame number of specimens was arranged uniformly\naround the centre. The third trough contained 1 L of tap\nwater and 1 L of prewashed, fine silica sand (250 mm\naverage particle size). The sand\u2013water mixture was deae-\nrated by purging with nitrogen for 10 min, and the samples\nwere buried in the sand to simulate the probable condition\nof Dolly\u2019s boiler when covered with lakebed sediment.\nAfter exposure for 3 months, the specimens were\ntaken out of the troughs and cleaned using a procedure\nbased on ASTM-G1.7 Loose corrosion products were\nremoved and the specimens were chemically cleaned in\n30% hydrochloric acid containing 0.76 g L21 of the\ninhibitor thiourea, and then reweighed. Uncorroded\ncontrol specimens were also exposed to the cleaning\nsolution to check the efficiency of the inhibitor and,\nwhere necessary, a correction was applied to the weight\nloss measurements.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)\nThe aim of these experiments was to compare the\ncorrosion behaviour of wrought iron exposed to\nCranfield tap water and buried in sand, as used in the\nweight loss measurements, with the corrosion when\nimmersed in water and sediment samples collected from\nUllswater. The measurements were performed with a\nSolartron 1280 potentiostat and electrochemical inter-\nface using a pair of cylindrical wrought iron electrodes\n(WI1), each with a surface area of 10 cm2 and separated\nby a distance of 5 mm.\nLinear polarisation resistance (LPR)\nElectrochemical measurements were carried out on\nUllswater at the spot near Glenridding where Dolly\nsank so that the in situ corrosion behaviour could be\ncompared with that observed in the laboratory. For\npractical reasons, battery operated linear polarisation\nresistance measurements (two point method) were used\nin preference to EIS. A weighted corrosion probe consi-\nsting of a pair of wrought iron electrodes (WI1), with the\nsame configuration as used in the EIS experiments, was\nlowered from a boat and measurements were taken at\n1 m intervals until the probe reached the lake bed. A dc\nof 6 mA was passed between the two electrodes using a\nconstant current source, and the potential difference\nbetween them (close to 10 mV) was recorded after a\nperiod of 2 min. The current was then reversed, and\nafter a further 2 min the potential difference was again\nrecorded. The polarisation resistance Rp was calculated\n8\nfrom the overall potential difference DV and the\ndifference in the applied currents DI\nRp~DV=DI (1)\nThe corrosion current density icorr was obtained from\nthe relationship\nicorr~B=Rp (2)\nwhere B is the Stern Geary constant, taken to be 15 mV.\n1 Typical longitudinal microstructures of WI1 and WI2\netched in 2% nital, showing equiaxed ferrite grain\nstructures and elongated slag inclusions\nTable 1 Compositions of slag inclusions in WI1 and WI2\n%C %Ca %Fe %Mg %Mn %Mo %O %P %Si\nWI1 slag 0.35 38.9 1.18 0.76 0.39 54.0 2.31 2.13\nWI2 slag 47.3 46.6 6.1\nTurnbull and Robinson Boiler corrosion on the historic vessel SL dolly\n144 Corrosion Engineering, Science and Technology 2005 VOL 40 NO 2\nFinally, icorr was converted into corrosion rate using\nFaraday\u2019s law.\nLPR measurements were also carried out in Cranfield\ntap water, with and without additions of fine sand, for\nfurther comparison with the EIS studies.\nResults and discussion\nWeight loss\nThe results of the weight loss measurements are shown\nin Fig. 2. It is clear that the oxygen content of the water\nhad a large effect on the corrosion of all three materials,\nthe rate in aerated water being approximately twice that\nin stagnant conditions. The values ranged between 0.1\nand 0.2 mm year21 for specimens in quiescent and\naerated conditions, and these correspond well with\ncorrosion rates usually reported for steels in water.9\nThe corrosion rates of specimens buried in sand were\nsubstantially lower than those in the aerated or stagnant\nwater.\nThe corrosion rates of the two wrought iron samples\nwere similar and they did not differ substantially from\nthose of the steel. While the corrosion rate of the steel in\naerated water was higher than that of the two wrought\niron samples, the rate for the buried steel was lower than\nthose of the other two. From these results, it appears\nthat the low corrosion rate of Dolly\u2019s boiler cannot be\nexplained by wrought iron having an inherently lower\ncorrosion rate than that normally associated with steel.\nThe influence of slag inclusions on the corrosion\nbehaviour of wrought iron is discussed in a later section.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy\nThe Nyquist plot10 for WI1 displaying the in-phase Z9\nand out of phase Z0 components of impedance in\nstagnant Cranfield tap water is shown in Fig. 3. A\nsemicircular curve was fitted to the data and its diameter\nwas used to establish the charge transfer resistance Rt,\nfrom which the corrosion rate was calculated using a\ncorresponding relationship to that for the LPR method,\ngiven in equation (2). At the lowest measurement\nfrequencies (approaching 1 mHz), the plot deviated\nfrom the semicircular form due to the controlling\ninfluence of oxygen transport to the metal surface. At\nthe highest frequencies (20 kHz and below), there was\nsome evidence of a surface film (small semicircle) and the\nintercept on the x-axis represents the resistance of the\nwater between the two electrodes (solution resistance).\nIn the case of the stagnant tap water, this resistance was\nin the order of 3800 V.\nFigure 4 shows the corresponding impedance plot in\ntap water when the WI1 sample was buried in silica\nsand. The form of the plot was essentially the same as\nthat in tap water alone but the solution resistance\nincreased to 12 000 V. This was caused by the sand\nacting as an incomplete non-conducting barrier such\nthat the ionic path was limited to the water occupying\nthe spaces between individual sand particles. Similarly,\nthe charge transfer resistance increased from 6800 V to\n54 000 V, indicating that there was a reduction in the\ncorrosion rate of the wrought iron, approaching an\norder of magnitude. Again, this was the result of the\nsand acting as a partial barrier, restricting electrolyte\naccess to the metal surface, together with the effects of\ndissolved oxygen depletion in the water.\nTable 2 Analysis of ASTM A106 steel\n%C %Mn %Si %P %S %Cr %Mo %Ni %Cu %Sn %V %Al\n0.142 0.643 0.242 0.007 0.005 0.127 0.028 0.102 0.195 0.014 0.000 0.030\n2 Mean corrosion rates of wrought iron (WI1 and WI2)\nand steel (BS) samples exposed to aerated and stag-\nnant Cranfield tap water and buried in fine silica sand\nfor 3 months\n3 Impedance plot for WI1 in stagnant Cranfield tap water\n4 Impedance plot for WI1 exposed to Cranfield tap water\nand fine silica sand\nTurnbull and Robinson Boiler corrosion on the historic vessel SL dolly\nCorrosion Engineering, Science and Technology 2005 VOL 40 NO 2 145\nThe values of solution resistance, charge transfer\nresistance and corrosion rate for WI1 in tap water and\nwater samples taken from Ullswater are summarised in\nTable 3 and Fig. 5. Important features of these results\nare the much higher values of solution resistance and\ncharge transfer resistance measured in the water sample\nfrom Ullswater, the latter corresponding to a substan-\ntially lower corrosion rate than that in tap water. The\nhigh solution resistance was the consequence of the\nlower concentration of dissolved solids in the Ullswater\nsample, as shown in Table 4. Indeed, the conductivities\nof the tap water and Ullswater samples were 281 and\n57 mS cm21, respectively, giving a ratio of 4.9:1. (The\nequivalent solution resistances of 3770 and\n25 100 V cm2 from EIS were in the ratio 1:6.6, indicat-\ning quite good agreement between the two measurement\nmethods.) It is interesting to compare the conductivity\nof the Ullswater sample with that measured for\ndeionised water (3 mS cm21). It is thought that the very\nlow levels of dissolved solids in Ullswater made an\nimportant contribution to the low corrosion rate.11\nWhereas burial in sand increased the solution\nresistance measured in tap water, for the reasons given\nabove, burial in Ullswater sediment lowered the solution\nresistance. This was due to the sediment sample\ncontaining more ions than the water alone, as shown\nin Table 5. However, more significantly, the charge\ntransfer resistance was higher in both Ullswater sedi-\nment and in sand, compared to the corresponding\nresults in water alone. Therefore, in each case the\ncorrosion rates in sediment and sand were considerably\nreduced. This suggests that, as the Ullswater sediment\nhad relatively high conductivity, it was the limited access\nof dissolved oxygen that was the more important factor\nin controlling the corrosion rate of buried samples.\nLinear polarisation resistance\nThe corrosion rates of WI1 measured at different depths\nin Ullswater are shown in Fig. 6. The LPR readings\nindicate that the rate was fairly constant until the\ncorrosion probe reached the lake bed at a depth of 17 m.\nThe corrosion rate appeared to be higher in the sediment\nbut this result needs further explanation, as it was\ninfluenced by the higher conductivity of the sediment, as\ndiscussed below.\nA disadvantage of the LPR method is that the\nmeasured resistance includes the solution resistance of\nthe electrolyte, which in the case of the lake water was\nvery large. When the probe entered the sediment, the\nsolution resistance fell, and this was interpreted as an\nincrease in corrosion rate. A second disadvantage of the\nmethod is that the full charge transfer resistance is rarely\nmeasured, and for this reason the corrosion rate can be\noverestimated. In this work, the LPR measurements\nconsisted of applying and then reversing a small dc signal\nto the electrodes over a total time of 4 min. Therefore, the\nLPR measurement was essentially equivalent to perform-\ning an EIS experiment at a single frequency of approxi-\nmately 4 mHz. This is confirmed by the close agreement\nbetween the LPR results and the impedance values at\n4 mHz, as shown in Table 6. It can also be seen that the\nLPR and EIS results were very similar in the two water\nsamples but that in the sand and sediment tests the LPR\nmethod overestimated the corrosion rates.\nIn conclusion, the in situ LPR measurements were\nvery useful in establishing that the corrosion rate was\nnot significantly affected by water depth in Ullswater,\nbut they emphasise that care is needed in interpreting\nthem in cases of high solution resistance.\nTable 3 Results of electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy\nEnvironment\nSolution\nresistance,\nV cm2\nCharge\ntransfer\nresistance,\nV cm2\nCorrosion\nrate, mm\nyear21\nCranfield tap water 3 770 6 800 0.026\nUllswater water 25 100 33 700 0.0052\nTap water z sand 12 000 53 900 0.0032\nUllswater sediment 8 880 68 700 0.0025\n5 Comparison of corrosion rates of WI1 in tap water and\nUllswater samples measured by EIS\n6 Effect of depth on corrosion rate of WI1 in Ullswater\nmeasured by the LPR technique\nTable 4 Analyses of Cranfield tap water and Ullswater\nsample\nSample\nParameter\nCranfield\ntap water Ullswater\nHardness, mg L21\nas CaCO3\n100 16\nAlkalinity, mg L21\nas CaCO3\n50 34\npH 6.9 7.4\nConductivity, mS cm21 281 57\nChloride, mg L21 30.6 4.2\nNitrate, mg L21 33.8 0.6\nNitrite, mg L21 ,0.01 ,0.01\nPhosphate, mg L21 0.07 None detected\nSulphate, mg L21 32.5 3.1\nElements detected\n(ICP\u2013AES)\nNa, Mg, Si, S, Ca Na, Mg, Ca\nTurnbull and Robinson Boiler corrosion on the historic vessel SL dolly\n146 Corrosion Engineering, Science and Technology 2005 VOL 40 NO 2\nExpected long term corrosion rate in Ullswater\nThe effect of long term exposure of wrought iron in\nUllswater can be estimated from a combination of the\nresults of the weight loss and EIS experiments. The\nweight loss measurements had the inherent advantage of\na longer exposure time, during which corrosion products\ndeveloped, producing surface conditions more represen-\ntative of those on Dolly\u2019s boiler. For practical reasons,\nweight loss tests were carried out in tap water alone, but\nthe EIS measurements provided a valuable comparison\nof the corrosion rates over the full range of tap water\nand Ullswater conditions.\nWhen rediscovered in 1960, Dolly\u2019s boiler was reported\nby the divers to have been visible and covered with just a\nthin layer of silt.12,13 Therefore, the corrosion rate mea-\nsured in the weight loss tests on buried samples appears to\nbe the most appropriate, although it could be argued that\nthe stagnant water tests were also applicable. The rate for\nWI1 buried in sand and tap water was 0.039 mm year21\n(Fig. 2). As the corrosion rate in Ullswater sediment from\nEIS measurements was 78% of that in sand and tap water\n(Table 3), the expected weight loss value in Ullswater\nsediment would be 0.030 mm year21.\nAlternatively, if the boiler is considered to have lain in\nessentially stagnant water, rather than having been\nburied, then the appropriate corrosion rate from weight\nloss measurements will be 0.086 mm year21. A compar-\nison of the corrosion rates in tap water and Ullswater\nyields an expected corrosion rate in stagnant Ullswater\nconditions of 0.018 mm year21. It is reasonable to\nconclude that the corrosion rate of WI1 would have\nbeen in the range 0.018\u20130.030 mm year21. Over the 67\nyears for which Dolly was submerged, this would\nrepresent a metal loss of 1.2\u20132.0 mm. It is thought\nunlikely that this metal loss would have been exceeded,\nas the progressive formation of thicker and more\nprotective corrosion products would be expected to\nhave reduced the long term corrosion rate.\nObserved metal loss on Dolly\u2019s boiler\nThe condition of the shell of the boiler (horizontal\nreturn firetube design) suggests that a metal loss of 1\u2013\n2 mm on the external surface is reasonable. However,\nthe original wall thickness is unknown (probably 10\u2013\n12 mm), so it is difficult to be certain on this point.\nUltrasonic thickness measurements were carried out to\ncompare the wall thickness in different regions, and the\nfirebox crown, which had been subject to direct heating\nduring Dolly\u2019s working life, was shown to have the\nlowest metal thickness.13 Parts of the lower shell that\nhad rested on a brickwork base were externally pitted,\nprobably because of differential aeration cells during\nsubmersion. Otherwise, the wall thickness was quite\nuniform. (The boiler was reported to have been empty\nwhen Dolly was recovered,14 so internal corrosion can\nbe disregarded.)\nEffect of water analysis\nThe Ullswater sample was similar to Cranfield tap water\n(Table 4), and confidence can be placed in the validity\nand relevance of the weight loss measurements per-\nformed in tap water. The Ullswater sample is classed as\nsoft water, while Cranfield tap water is moderately soft\/\nslightly hard. They have similar pH values and both\nhave negative Langelier indices,5 indicating that they are\nnon-scale forming.\nWhile heavy metals were found in the lakebed sediment\n(Table 5), these are thought to have been bound up in\nstable compounds, as extraction in an acid was required in\norder to analyse them by Inductively Coupled Plasma\nAtomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICPAES). No heavy\nmetal ions were detected in the water sample and they\nare not thought to have contributed to the corrosion rate\nby plating onto the metal surface. The low corrosion rates\nmeasured in the lake suggest that microbially influenced\ncorrosion was not a factor in the boiler corrosion. This was\nconfirmed by the low number of sulphate reducing bacteria\ndetected in the lakebed sediment (,10 colony forming\nunits mL21).\nInfluence of slag inclusions\nThe slag inclusions were shown to be cathodic to the\nferrite grains in both wrought iron materials tested.\nPolished samples were immersed in tap water and\nremoved at intervals for examination under an optical\nmicroscope. It was found that corrosion products\nformed first in areas close to the slag inclusions, as\n7 Formation of corrosion products at cathodic sites\nassociated with slag inclusions on WI1 after 30 min in\ntap water\nTable 6 Comparison of LPR values with EIS values at\n4 mHz and charge transfer resistances\nEnvironment\nLinear\npolarisation\nresistance,\nV cm2\nImpedance\nat 4 mHz,\nV cm2\nCharge\ntransfer\nresistance,\nV cm2\nCranfield tap water 6 772 6 928 6 801\nUllswater water 29 848 29 000 33 656\nTap water z sand 17 141 18 645 53 906\nUllswater sediment 13 068 13 333 68 742\nTable 5 Analysis of Ullswater sediment\nSolids\ncontent,\nmg L21\nElements\ndetected\n(ICPAES)\nSulphate\nreducing\nbacteria\n30 000 B, Na, Mg, Al,\nSi, P, S, K, Ca,\nTi, V, Mn, Fe,\nCu, Zn, As, Sr,\nCd, Sb, Ba, Pt, Pb\n,10 colony\nforming units mL21\nTurnbull and Robinson Boiler corrosion on the historic vessel SL dolly\nCorrosion Engineering, Science and Technology 2005 VOL 40 NO 2 147\nshown in Fig. 7. This identified the inclusions as\ncathodic sites, as it was the pH increase associated with\nthe cathodic reaction that caused the precipitation of\niron hydroxide. The galvanic interaction between the\nslag inclusions and adjacent ferrite grains would be\nexpected to have caused high corrosion rates. However,\nit appears that the exposed inclusions were sufficiently\nsmall in area for the acceleration of corrosion to be\nfairly insignificant.\nBalasubramaniam2 proposed that the cathodic reac-\ntion on the slag inclusions in wrought iron could exceed\nthe critical current density required to passivate the\nanodic ferrite, thus reducing the corrosion rate. He\nattributed the corrosion resistance of the Delhi iron\npillar partly to this effect, as the iron has a high\nphosphorus content, which promotes passivity, and\npartly to the wetting and drying conditions that led to\nthe formation of adherent, non-porous corrosion\nproducts. It is not evident that the wrought irons\ninvestigated in the present study behaved in this way, as\nthey did not contain significant phosphorus in the\nferrite, and when they were tested in fully immersed\nconditions their corrosion rates differed little from that\nof carbon steel.\nConclusions\n1. There were two principal causes for the low\ncorrosion rate of Dolly\u2019s wrought iron boiler in\nUllswater. The first was the low oxygen content of the\nwater at the lake bed, particularly beneath the thin layer\nof silt that had collected on the boiler\u2019s surface. The\nsecond cause was the low conductivity of the lake water,\nwhich had a composition similar to that of rain water\nand contained only small concentrations of dissolved\nsolids.\n2. The corrosion rate of wrought iron in the lakebed\nenvironment is estimated to be in the range 0.018\u2013\n0.030 mm year21, which corresponds to a metal loss of\n1.2\u20132.0 mm over the 67 years for which Dolly was\nsubmerged. Weight loss measurements in water and\nsediment environments showed that the corrosion rates\nof wrought iron did not differ greatly from those of\nmodern boiler steel.\n3. Slag inclusions in the wrought iron were shown to\nbe cathodic to the ferrite grains but the relatively small\nareas of the inclusions meant that the corrosion rate was\nnot accelerated significantly. The possible effects of\nheavy metals and microbial activity in the sediment were\nconsidered, but they are not thought to have contributed\nto the corrosion behaviour of the boiler.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors are grateful for assistance provided by the\nWindermere Steamboats Museum, Cumbria, where SL\nDolly is displayed.\nReferences\n1.
