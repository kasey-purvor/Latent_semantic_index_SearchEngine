The higher education sector can clearly deliver\n70\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\ndistance education. However, in the current ideological and financial drive towards\nincreasing the distance education component of higher education, one of the key questions\nis this: is the quality of the distance education offered in higher education equivalent to the\nquality of its classroom-based education?\nThis paper reports a study carried out in the University of Paisley, which attempts to shed\nsome light on this question. It makes a specific comparison of the results achieved by\nclassroom-based students and distance-learning students undertaking the same degree\ncourse. All the students under comparison study the same module material and undertake\nidentical assessments. But they study in different modes and in different locations in the\nworld: some based on the campus in the town of Paisley and undertaking the course by\nconventional classroom-based learning; others geographically dispersed - with the\nmajority living in Hong Kong - and accessing the course by distance learning.\nOne indicator of the quality of learning and teaching is the results that students achieve in\nassessable coursework. Accordingly we have phrased our research question in the following\nterms: do post-registration nurses studying by distance learning achieve the same assessment\nresults as colleagues undertaking the same module by conventional classroom-based study?\nComparing distance education and classroom education\nPeterson (2001) states that scholars of distance learning fall into two main camps. The first\ncamp argues that distance learning is an opportunity for those that could not usually\nattend university to participate in tertiary education; that it promotes lifelong learning; and\nthat 'the experience of an online course can be as rich and fulfilling as the experience of a\ntraditional course'. They argue that more diverse populations of students with different\nlearning styles can benefit from online courses.\nThe second camp argues that in distance learning the focus is on teaching rather than on\nlearning, and that the claims of flexibility are not reflected in present distance learning\ncourses. They argue that students are frustrated, not just by the feelings of isolation but by\nlack of feedback from their teachers and difficulty in understanding written instructions\ngiven to them (Peterson, 2001). Ng (2001) highlights a number of issues relating to\nproblems of delivering distance learning. He noted that social cohesion with the group of\nstudents was not good and that communication between students was limited and focused\nmainly on personal rather than academic issues. Several students in his study felt anxiety\nabout using electronic (email) communication.\nEdwards, Hugo, Cragg and Peterson (1999) assert that 'research generally shows no\nsignificant difference in educational outcomes [that is, course achievement and satisfaction\nwith instruction] between courses taught through distance education and those offered in\nthe regular classroom'. Such a conclusion is a typical one from the research looking at\ndifferences in educational outcomes associated with conventional classroom-based\neducation and distance education. The issue of 'significant difference' is one that Russell\n(1999 and 2002) and McGreal (2002) have both tackled by assembling annotated\nbibliographies of comparative research studies.\nThe authors of this present study have carried out a meta-analysis of thirty-seven studies\nthat specifically deal with online education and which are reported in either Russell's No\n71\nTim Duffy et a! Comparing distance education and conventional education\nSignificant Difference or McGreal's Significant Difference annotated bibliographies. The\nmeta-analysis is restricted to research reported in the decade 1992-2002. The findings from\nthis meta-analysis are presented in Table 1. This meta-analysis shows that most studies\nhave focused on academic performance as their means of comparing the effectiveness of\nonline distance education with conventional classroom-based education. The majority (16\nstudies out of 31) have found that there is no significant difference in the academic\nperformance of online students when compared with on-campus students. However, a\nsignificant number of studies (13 out of 31) find that students in online courses outperform\nconventional students in terms of academic performance measured by examinations. A\nmajority of studies found that the quality of learning and the participation in learning is\nalso higher in distance education.\nIn the area of student satisfaction, the picture is reversed. A significant number of studies\n(four out of seven) report that the on-campus students are more satisfied with their courses\nthan the online students.\nFocus of the research reported\nAcademic performance\nmeasured by examinations, tests\nor grades\nStudent satisfaction with\nthe course\nQuality of learning and learning\noutcomes achieved\nStudent participation in\nthe course\nRetention rates\nPass rates\nFaculty evaluation of the course\nNumber of\nstudies\n31\n7\n5\n2\n2\n2\n2\nNumber of\nstudies\nreporting no\nsignificant\ndifference\n16\n3\n2\n0\n0\n0\n1\nNumber of\nstudies finding\nin favour of\nonline\neducation\n13\n0\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\nNumber of\nstudies finding\nin favour of\nconventional\neducation\n2\n4\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\nTable I: Meta-analysis of research studies reported in the 'No Significant Difference' and 'Significant\nDifference' annotated bibliographies\nWe might, then, summarize a decade of literature comparing the effectiveness of\nclassroom-based education and distance education in the following terms: distance\neducation involving online support is at least as effective as classroom-based education in\nterms of academic performance measured by examination, and in several cases more\neffective. It seems to promote a higher level of student participation. But it does not obtain\nsuch high student satisfaction ratings as classroom-based education.\nThis summary needs to be qualified. In 1999, Phipps and Merisotis conducted a review of\nthe contemporary literature on the effectiveness of distance learning for the American\nInstitute of Higher Education Policy (IHEP). Their overall conclusion agrees with the\nmeta-analysis presented above, although they report more positive studies on student\n72\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\nsatisfaction. But they add a caveat: 'The most important problem is that the overall quality\nof the original research is questionable and thereby renders many of the findings\ninconclusive' (Phipps and Merisotis, 1999: 18). One of the limitations of the research that\nthey identify, for example, is that many of the studies focus on part of a course, rather than\na whole educational programme. That is a charge that the authors of this paper recognize\nmay be laid against their own study.\nEducational culture in Hong Kong and Scotland\nIt is appropriate to set the study reported in this paper in its educational and cultural\ncontext. There are two main educational backgrounds to be aware of: the British (that is,\nthe distinct Scottish and English) educational backgrounds of the on-campus students and\nof the distance-learning students who are supported directly from the university with no\nface-to-face teacher contact; and the Chinese educational background of the distance\nlearning students who live in Hong Kong and who have some face-to-face contact with\ntheir teachers.\nBecause of its colonial history, the educational culture in Hong Kong is derived from two\ndistinct traditions, Chinese and English. The Chinese tradition holds a 'deep reverence for\nlearning, a predilection for the integration of knowledge and delight in formal reasoning'\n(University Grants Committee, 1996). The English tradition is concerned with a far more\npragmatic approach to learning. Both systems have moved away from elitist traditions\ntoward more inclusive, mass higher education systems.\nLi Yixian (1992) observes that most students in Hong Kong study solely for the purpose of\nobtaining a degree and, consequently, to improve their chances in the labour market. This\naligns with the assertion made by Sumner (2000) that distance education is frequently\n'instrumental' and 'serves the system'.\nThe Scottish dimension of the degree programme probably spans both the English and the\nChinese philosophies. In the Report of the Scottish Committee to the National Inquiry\ninto Higher Education, Garrick detected a 'strong belief in Scotland in the value of\neducation, partly for its own sake and partly to overcome economic or social disadvantage'\n(Garrick, 1997).\nBackground to the study\nThe University of Paisley first offered its B.Sc. in Health Studies in 1991. This course was\nspecifically designed to meet the demand from health care personnel with a desire to\nupgrade their professional qualifications to degree status. It aimed to do this by offering a\nflexible, part-time mode of study while offering credit for prior accredited learning. To date\nmore than one thousand students have graduated through the conventional on-campus\ndelivery programme. These students have been health professionals, mostly nurses, working\nin the West and Central Belt of Scotland.\nIn 1995 further flexibility was built into the delivery when this programme was also made\navailable by computer-supported distance learning. At the time of writing (January 2002),\nover 800 students have graduated through the distance-learning programme. Those\n73\nTim Duffy et a\\ Comparing distance education and conventional education\nstudents have been health professionals, mostly nurses, and the bulk of them are working\nin Hong Kong. With the advent of the new Hong Kong Hospital Authority in 1992, the\nbachelor's degree became the preferred route for a Registered Nurse to advance to the\nstatus of Nursing Officer. Large numbers began to seek opportunities to further their\nstudies. The majority of them preferred distance learning, from either Australian or United\nKingdom universities. Paisley University was the only UK university with a presence in\nHong Kong that offered a degree in Health Studies.\nThe main overall distinction we draw in this paper is between the conventional classroom-\nbased delivery and the distance-learning delivery. However, within the distance-learning\ndelivery, there are two main variations in the support given to students. One version\nincorporates some face-to-face support from an on-site tutor. This is the pattern of\ndelivery for our students in Hong Kong. The other version involves no face-to-face contact\nbut relies solely on computer-mediated support by teachers based in the university. This is\nthe pattern of delivery for our students who are dispersed throughout the United Kingdom\nor situated in Norway or Switzerland.\nIn summary, the three forms of course delivery are:\n1. on-campus delivery, in conventional classroom-based format;\n2. supported distance learning using networked learning, with optional face-to-face\ncontact;\n3. supported distance learning using networked learning, with no face-to-face contact.\nThis paper focuses on one module within the B.Sc. Health Studies programme -\n'Professional Practice and Teaching'. This is a module that enables health professionals to\nstudy, and apply in practice, educational principles which are applicable in their clinical\npractice when teaching patients or junior colleagues. We have selected this module because\nall the students in the groups that we will consider have undertaken the same generic\nassignment. We can use the mean scores achieved by each group as an outcome measure to\nmake reliable comparisons between the groups.\nThe different forms of course delivery\nThis section gives an outline of the three modes of delivery of the module 'Professional\nPractice and Teaching' with a particular focus on the following aspects:\n\u2022 the actual mode of delivery;\n\u2022 the processes of student support; and\n\u2022 the assessments which the students undertake.\nMode of delivery\nThe conventional on-campus delivery of the module is taught over a period of twelve\nweeks (one semester). The class meets for two hours one evening per week. The main\napproach to teaching the module is the modified lecture. Within the lecture there are\nexercises focused on the development of specific teaching skills.\nThe distance-learning students receive core material in the form of printed booklets. They\nalso receive that same material as an electronic document, in hypertext format. It is\n74\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\nimportant to note that the course content for the distance-learning students is identical to the\ncourse content for the classroom-based students. The distance-learning version of the course\nis a development of the lecture-based version, and is not an alternative course. The distance-\nlearning material incorporates interactive features, exercises and self-assessment questions.\nStudent support\nSupport for the on-campus students\nWithin the timetable for the conventional on-campus delivery there are embedded two\nclasses, which are entitled 'tutorial support'. These classes occur the week before the\nassignments are due. In all, four hours in the module are designated for student support.\nOngoing tutorial support was usually given immediately after the taught classes, lasting\nanything up to an hour. The learners were informed of the availability of individual\ntutorial support during the day, but this service is seldom used. Occasionally telephone\ntutorial support was requested and given.\nSupport for all distance-learning students\nWithin the distance-learning approach there are two different modes for supporting the\nstudent, one in which there is face-to-face contact, and one without. In both modes,\ncommunication between the students and the teacher and between the students and each\nother is maintained by an 'electronic campus'. This is a virtual learning environment that\nsupports email, asynchronous (delayed time) and synchronous (real-time) discussion and a\nrepository of relevant documents and articles. Students have access to their tutor throughout\nthe module, and should have an answer within twenty-four hours of making an enquiry.\nSupport for distance-learning students who have only online contact\nIn the no-face-to-face contact mode, as exemplified by the United Kingdom mode of\ndelivery, the support the students received - and gave to each other - was carried out\nonline. Email correspondence between the teacher and the students during the module\nconsisted of both general messages addressed to the whole student group and individual\nmessages for individual students.\nThe teacher initiated 24 general messages in the eight weeks of the module. These messages\ncommunicated information that all the students required. The number of messages sent by\nthe teacher to individual students ranged from 14 to 24 messages. These messages\nconcerned specific issues about which the students wished to consult their teacher. The\naverage number of exchanges was 43 exchanges, or 86 separate messages over the eight\nweeks of the module (each exchange involves a communication and a response).\nStudents and the teacher participated in five discussion forums and six teleconferences. In\nthe forums, key topics related to the module and requiring in-depth exploration were\ndiscussed online. Participants were free to contribute to this discussion at any time within\nthe week and participation was voluntary. At the end of the week, the discussion was\nsummarized by the teacher and the summary archived as an educational resource. In the\nteleconferences, which are real-time discussion events, a topic was agreed in advance and\nparticipants shared their views by keyboard conferencing.\nThe major difference between the Hong Kong and the United Kingdom-based distance\nlearning groups was the greater use of electronically mediated discussion by the United\nKingdom students.\n75\nTim Duffy et al Comparing distance education and conventional education\nSupport for distance-learning students who have online contact plus additional face-to-face\ncontact\nDistance-learning students in Hong Kong had the benefit of face-to-face contact in the form\nof tutorials. Attendance at these was variable. These students also used email to send questions\nor messages once they had identified an issue. This obviated the need to wait until the next\navailable face-to-face tutorial. On average, the teacher received ten emails per week. Mes-\nsages typically concerned administrative information such as the dates for course commence-\nment and assignment release, as well as information on the scheduling of face-to-face\ntutorials, topics for discussion and any preparation that was necessary for participation in\nthese.\nAs most of the students were nurses working shifts, it was often difficult to arrange suitable\ntimes to be online together. An attempt was made to arrange teleconferences for the\nstudents, but only three students responded online. Forum discussions are not dependent\non synchronicity, but the Hong Kong students were noted to be reluctant to respond to the\nquestion set for the forum. Ng (2001) similarly found Hong Kong students to lack social\ncohesion as a group, to demonstrate limited communication with each other and to show\nanxiety about computer-mediated communication. There was also a tendency for the\nstudents to demand answers from the teacher rather than engage in discussion, the\n'instrumental' approach that we have alluded to already from Sumner's (2000) study.\nAssessments\nThe assignments used in the assessment process were identical for all students taking this\nmodule. The assignments involve the students in carrying out a learning needs assessment\nin their places of work and, on the basis of their analysis of learning needs, delivering an\nappropriate lesson. They must also evaluate the lesson that they have delivered.\nStudents made use of different support mechanisms in preparing to submit their assign-\nments. In the distance-learning mode that included face-to-face support, students\nparticipated in tutorials allowing them to raise questions and receive guidance. Emails to\nthe teachers increased in frequency in the run-up to the submission date. Some students\npreferred to page the teacher, allowing them to talk directly with the teacher on the phone\nand receive an immediate answer to their enquiries.\nIn the distance-learning mode that excluded face-to-face contact, discussion forums were\nsuspended in the period when assignments were due. Teleconferences continued, as they are a\ngood means by which students can access teachers for last-minute guidance. Some students\nwere entirely independent in the preparation and submission of their assignments. Others\nmade full use of the tutor, by submitting one-page drafts of their ideas foT comment, or\nsections of their proposed assignments for comment. Although these means of support are\ndifferent in the forms of communication they employ, they are equivalent in effect.\nAnalysis of the outcomes from assessments\nThis study seeks to identify what difference, if any, exists between student performance, as\nmeasured by the marks awarded to students from their assignments, and the different\ndelivery modes that have been described.\n76\nAlt-] Volume 10 Number I\nMethod\nEarlier in this paper we identified three different modes of delivery of this course. For the\npurposes of this analysis, four student groups are identified and their marks presented. The\nreason for this increase of groups from three to four for analysis is that one of the groups\n(the Hong Kong distance-learning student group) comprises two types of student:\nindigenous Chinese students and expatriate British students. Treating the marks gained by\nthese students separately may enable us to elucidate the influence of culture.\nThe four groups identified for the purpose of comparison are:\n1. Chinese students in Hong Kong studying by distance learning and supported from\nHong Kong (group 1, n=85);\n2. British students in Hong Kong studying by distance learning and supported from Hong\nKong (group 2, n= 15);\n3. British students in the United Kingdom studying by distance learning and supported\nfrom Paisley (group 3, n=17);\n4. British students studying in a classroom-based environment and supported on campus\nat Paisley (group 4, n=37).\nResults\nDuring the module, students submit two pieces of coursework for assessment - a learning\nneeds assessment that they have carried out and an account and evaluation of a teaching\nGroup Number Mean score\nGroup I (Chinese, distance learning, Hong Kong)\nGroup 2 (British, distance learning, HK)\nGroup 3 (British, distance learning, UK)\nGroup 4 (British, classroom-based, UK)\nTable 2: Assessment results for the four groups of students: mean scores for the module 'Professional\nPractice andTeaching'\nsession that they have conducted. For each of these groups, the average mark for the two\npieces of assessed coursework was calculated. The comparison of the mean scores achieved\nby each of these groups is presented in Table 2:\nIt is clear, from the scores presented in Table 2, that these students are successfully meeting\nthe demands of the assessments in this module. The pass mark is 40 per cent and the mean\nscore for each group is well in excess of that. At face value, the scores presented in Table 2\nindicate that British students studying by distance learning, either in Hong Kong (group 2)\nor in the UK (group 3), are achieving the highest scores in this module. Their average\nscores are almost the same. British students studying on campus (group 4) and Chinese\nstudents studying by distance learning in Hong Kong and supported from Hong Kong\n(group 1) have achieved identical scores in this module.\n77\n85\n15\n17\n37\n61\n74\n72\n61\n77m Duffy et al Comparing distance education and conventional education\nBecause of the disparate sizes of the groups from which we have derived these mean scores,\nwe then subjected our data to analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test. When all four groups\nwere considered together, this test confirmed the statistical significance of the difference\nacross group means (H = 45.4163; significance, p < .01). The differences between the pairs\nGroups\nCompared\n1 and 2\n1 and 3\n1 and 4\n2 and 3\n2 and 4\n3 and 4\nH-value from\nKruskal-Wallis\n26.6573*\n19.1488*\n0.3869\n0.6012\n24.2715*\n18.7099*\nTable 3: Comparisons of the mean scores achieved by\nthe four groups of students, using Kruskal-Wallis.\n*p<.0l\nof groups were then analysed. Application of the Kruskal-Wallis test allowed us to\ndistinguish those face value comparisons between groups which can be substantiated\nstatistically from those which cannot. These comparisons are presented in Table 3.\nFrom the analysis presented in Table 3, we can state the significant findings as follows:\n\u2022 British students studying by distance learning in Hong Kong achieved a significantly\nhigher average mark than their Chinese counterparts.\n\u2022 British students studying by distance learning in the United Kingdom achieved a\nsignificantly higher average mark than Chinese students studying by distance learning\nin Hong Kong.\n\u2022 British distance-learning students, whether based in Hong Kong or in the United King-\ndom, achieved a significantly higher average mark than British classroom-based students.\nDiscussion\nIt is important to avoid simplistic cause and effect conclusions about these findings. There\nare several factors to consider, and we outline these here.\nThe language of instruction\nThe language of instruction for this degree programme is English. This is the first language\nof the British students in each of the modes of delivery of this course. It is, however, a\nsecond language for the Chinese students. For most of them their first language is\nCantonese or Mandarin. So, in our comparison of results, we have to bear in mind that our\nChinese students are studying the module material and constructing their assignments in a\nforeign language, while the British students are studying in their mother tongue.\nHowever, we cannot jump to conclusions about the effect of studying in a language that is\nnot the student's first language. Some of the Hong Kong students completed their basic\nnursing training in Hong Kong Government Schools of Nursing where the language of\ninstruction was English. Moreover, the Hong Kong-based students have to possess an\nequivalent level of competence in English as the on-campus students in the United\nKingdom. Their competence in English is further attested by the internal moderators of\ntheir assessable coursework and by the external examiners.\n78\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\nCultural differences between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom\nThe pattern of social interaction in a society - and particularly the interaction between\nstudents and teachers - is an aspect of culture that impinges on the educational experience.\nWe have already noted that Hong Kong students were reluctant to raise questions and to\nengage in discussion in the public domain of the online forum. Ip, Lee, Lee, Chou,\nWootton and Chang (2000) have detected a negative disposition towards critical thinking\namong Chinese undergraduate nursing students. However, this reluctance is not unique to\nthe Chinese students. The United Kingdom-based students also showed reluctance at times\nto participate in online discussions. This reticence is, in fact, a widespread and common\naspect of online education.\nThere is, perhaps, among the Chinese students a greater respect for the status and\nknowledge of the teacher. However, our discussions with other teachers in Hong Kong\nindicate that this is fading fast. Moreover, Fung and Carr (2000) found that the image of\nthe Hong Kong students as passive and tutor-directed is not borne out. Hong Kong\nstudents are rapidly becoming the same as students in the United Kingdom and USA in\nterms of treating their teachers as sources of information who are open to challenge. This\napproach was evident in the response of the Chinese students to their teachers when they\nrequired help with preparing assignments. The Chinese students made heavy demands on\ntheir teachers as the date of submission approached, contacting their teachers by phone,\npager and email. This matches exactly the pattern of communication that occurs on\ncampus when the submission of an assignment draws near.\nThe role of personal ambition and drive\nThe prospect of promotion by means of obtaining a degree is a strong motivator for the\nChinese students in Hong Kong. Our discussions with the students and their tutors in\nHong Kong make it clear that that is their major rationale for undertaking the degree. The\nappeal of a British degree is also a significant factor in their choice of programme.\nHowever, the British students in Hong Kong are working within the same health care\nsystem. They benefit in the same way as their Chinese counterparts from the possession of\na relevant degree. Their motivation is likely to be the same. But their marks are\nsignificantly higher. Something more than personal ambition and drive lies behind the\ndifferences in results that we have found.\nDifferent values placed on higher education\nThere is a contradiction in what we have found in terms of the different values placed on\nhigher education in Britain and Hong Kong. On the one hand, we have reported the\ntraditional Chinese reverence for learning, compared with the pragmatic British attitude to\nlearning. On the other hand, we have identified that our Chinese students are more likely to\nbe motivated by the pragmatic prospects of promotion and enhanced salary than our\nBritish students.\nIn fact there is probably a levelling factor to consider - the influence of the profession in\nwhich these students are working. It is mandatory for nurses in the United Kingdom to\nkeep their knowledge up to date and to provide evidence of this. In Hong Kong, such\nupdating is not mandatory, but most large Hong Kong hospitals require their nursing\npersonnel to study for Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) points and to achieve a\n79\nTim Duffy et al Comparing distance education and conventional education\nminimum number of CNE points each year. It is likely that these mechanisms to ensure\ncontinuing professional education override the different values placed on higher education\nby the two cultural groups that we are considering.\nVariations in mode of delivery\nThere is a significant difference in the results obtained by students undertaking this module\nin its different modes of delivery. The average marks obtained by students in the distance\nlearning programme are 61 (group 1), 74 (group 2) and 72 (group 3). This gives an average\nmark over these groups of 69. This is significantly higher numerically than the average\nmark of 61 for the classroom-based students. But it is not significantly higher in terms of\ngrade. Both of these marks lie within the B+ grade in the University of Paisley grading\nscheme; in fact, they are the lower and upper boundaries of that grade. We can say that\nstudents studying this module by distance learning obtain marks that are significantly\nhigher than the marks obtained by students studying the module by attendance on campus,\nbut that the difference does not extend as far as a difference in grade.\nVariations in teacher input due to variations in class numbers\nThe last factor we consider in our discussion is the input of teachers to these groups,\nparticularly in the light of the different sizes of the groups the teachers are working with.\nOn campus, the average class size in the B.Sc. Health Studies programme is twenty\nstudents. The mean score these students are achieving in their assignments for this module\nis 61 per cent (see Table 1). In the Hong Kong distance-learning mode, the average number\nof students per tutor group is 20 students. When we aggregate the marks gained by all the\nstudents studying by distance learning in Hong Kong (that is, both Chinese and British\nstudents), we see that these students are achieving a mean score of 68 per cent in their\nassignments. The average class size for the United Kingdom-based distance-learning\nstudents in this study is nine students. The mean score these students are achieving in their\nassignments is 72 per cent. These results would at least indicate that the increased contact\nthat students have with their teacher - due to both the means of delivery of their course\nand their class numbers - leads to increased scores in assignments.\nConclusions\nBoth our distance-learning and our classroom-based modes of delivery are enabling\nstudents to complete the module 'Professional Practice and Teaching' successfully.\nWhen we compare the average marks obtained by those undertaking the degree by distance\nlearning and those undertaking it on campus, we find that the distance-learning students\nare obtaining significantly higher marks than the classroom-based students. That differ-\nence, though numerically of statistical significance, does not stretch to a grade difference.\nOn average, then, our distance-learning students and our classroom-based students in this\nmodule are obtaining the same overall grades.\nThe term 'distance learning' is no more a unitary term than the term 'classroom-based\nlearning'. In both these modes of delivery there are widely different practices. In the\nmodule we have considered here, distance learning encompasses independent learning\nenhanced by face-to-face tutorials and computer-mediated distance learning with no face-\nto-face tutorials. We have tried to identify these differences using the average scores\n80\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number I\nachieved and the results indicate that the entirely online form of computer-mediated\ndistance learning is associated with the highest scores in the module under consideration.\nThis is the first stage of our research. It has been a retrospective study. The next step is a\nprospective study. This forthcoming study will focus on only two modes of delivery,\nclassroom-based study and supported distance learning with no face-to-face contact. Once\nagain the independent variable will be the common assessment, which all students in the\nstudy will undertake. However, the role of culture, existing professional background and\nmotivation in the lives of the students who are undertaking this degree programme will\ncontinue to influence our findings.\nAcknowledgement\nThe help of Mr David McVey, writer of distance-learning material, in preparing this\nmanuscript is acknowledged by the authors.\nReferences\nEdwards, N., Hugo, K., Cragg, B. and Peterson, J.
