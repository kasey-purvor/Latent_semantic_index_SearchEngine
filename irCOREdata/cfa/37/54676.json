Asymmetric switching of the power devices is used to facilitate independent control of the\noutputs to provide +5V and +3.3V from a 15V-20V input supply over a range of load conditions.\nIntroduction\nThere is increasing interest in the provision of power supply technologies that provide multiple outputs-\ntypical growth areas being the telecommunications, computer and microprocessor industries where mobile\nphones, PDAs and handheld products typically require 3.3V, 5V, 12V and 15V supplies for various\ninterfaces. Enabling technologies such as high frequency, high power switching devices and low cost\ndigital control system has spawned significant interest on resonant converters as possible candidates for\nsuch DC-DC converters, delivering independently stabilized outputs. Analytical work on the behaviour of\nmulti-output series resonant converters (SRC), has been presented in [1, 2]. However, only one of these\noutputs is normally regulated through feedback control, with the remainder being either unregulated or\nsecondary-side post regulated. A key drawback of such strategies, however, is the cross regulation error\non the unregulated output that is subjected to frequency regulation. The treatment in [3] suggests the\nimplementation of a PWM control technique to minimise poor cross regulation problems, whilst [4, 5]\npropose that use of a centre-tapped transformer that is terminated through two output windings, and full\nwave rectification. A major disadvantage of the suggested configuration, however, is the high rectifier\ndiode count that accompanies the full bridge rectification, and, once again, recourse to a single closed-\nloop to regulate one output, is made.\nQl C > nlh OUtpUt\nDI\nCs Ls +Vout1\n.2 - .L RL\nD2\np2 2 L2\nGaelrvrControl Signal FEeeback\nCohtrol\nFig. 1: Dual-load LCLC resonant converter with feedback control\nEPE 2005 Dresden P.'\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL-LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\n2005 - Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.1\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\nHere, the use of dual-output resonant LCLC converters, Fig. 1, that are excited asymmetrically through\nboth duty-cycle and frequency control, to maintain a desired output voltage distribution, is proposed. A\nstate variable model of the proposed converter is developed to aid in the design and analysis. Solutions\ngenerated from the state space model, are discussed, and compared with measurements from an\nexperimental converter. The feasibility of the proposed converter is further underpinned by the\ndevelopment of a basic control scheme that yields stable system responses and excellent regulation\nbehaviour on both outputs.\nCircuit model of the dual-loads LCLC-SPRC\nDesign and analysis of fourth-order resonant converters with capacitive output filters, have been\npreviously considered in [6]. From the results therein, it was shown that all variants provided beneficial\nattributes compared to 2nd_order SRC and PRC counterparts, by combining their best features, i.e. they can\nbe regulated over a wide load range with reduced circulating power. Moreover, parasitic elements that are\nnormally problematic for other converter designs can be readily absorbed into the resonant network to\nenhance performance and reduce mass and volume.\nA schematic of a half-bridge LCLC-SPRC with two outputs is shown in Fig. 2(a). By changing the full\nbridge rectifier to a dual-complementary rectifier, the resulting dual-load converter combines the benefits\nof requiring a minimum number of rectifier diodes and the ability for multi-output regulation. The rectifier\nis most efficient under balanced high- and low-side output loading, and, is typically used together with\ncapacitor-type output filters for low current rating applications.\nvC DI\nCs itir< i | _ 1 jLl\nL2 D2\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 2: Dual-load 4\"f-order resonant converter (a) schematic (b) typical operating waveforms\nEPE 2005 Dresden P.2\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL-LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\n2005 - Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.2\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\nThe transformer in Fig. 2(a) can be modelled as an ideal voltage conversion component with a\nmagnetising inductance, Lm, series primary leakage inductance, Llp and secondary series leakage\ninductances, LI,, and L1s2. Since the primary leakage inductance of a well-designed ferrite transformer is\nmuch smaller than the magnetising inductances, Lm, it can be absorbed into the resonant tank series\ninductor, L. The value of the series resonant inductance can be increased by adding discrete components,\nif required, to satisfy pre-determined design constraints.\nTo demonstrate the ability of the converter to deliver unsymmetrical output voltages, under balanced load\nconditions, the transformer is constrained to have unity turns-ratios on both output windings, and the high-\nand low-side parallel resonant capacitors, Cpl and Cp2, are selected to have identical values. The output\nfilter capacitors, Cf1 and Cf2, are assumed to be large enough so the voltages they are subjected to can be\nconsidered constant over a switching period.\nSince current flows through the primary side of the transformer to the top- and bottom-sides of the\nrectifier, during different half-cycles of tank excitation, see Fig. 2(b), each output is replenished with\nenergy alternately. During the positive half-cycle of the parallel resonant capacitor voltage waveform, vcp,\nthe resonant current flows toward the top-side rectifier through to output, RLI, resulting in the voltage\nVO,tl; whilst the resonant current then supplies power to Vo,t2 when the polarity of the resonant capacitor\nvoltage changes polarity. Diodes DI and D2 clip the parallel capacitor voltage to +Vo,tl or -Vout2.\nClassically, either the high-side or low-side output will be closed-loop regulated through frequency\nmodulation. However, variations in line voltage or load resistance then yield cross regulation errors [1, 2]\non the unregulated output. Moreover, an asymmetric output voltage distribution cannot be achieved, in\ngeneral, under balanced output load conditions, regardless of switching frequency. It is therefore proposed\nthat the converter is operated asymmetrically through variation of input voltage duty cycle, and frequency,\nto facilitate regulation of both output voltages.\nState-variable analysis of dual-load resonant converter\nA state-variable model describing the behaviour of the dual-load converter can be obtained by considering\nthe electrical network in Fig. 2. The model is derived by separating the converter dynamics into 'fast' and\n'slow' sub-systems, with their interaction related by a set of coupling equations. The leakage inductance\nof a well-designed ferrite transformer is normally small compared to its magnetising inductance. For this\nreason, its effect are neglected, for brevity. State variables are selected based on voltages and currents that\ngovern the operation of the resonant tank. The fast sub-system is therefore considered to describe the\ndynamics of the resonant tank and power switches (1)-the underlying equations exclude the effects of\nparasitics.\ndiLS Vi -vCS -vLP diLP VLP\ndt Ls dt Lp\ndVCs =Ls dVCP iLs iLP iR iCp2 -iR2 dVCp2 iLs -iLP -iRi cp -iR2 (1)\ndt Cs dt Cp1 dt Cp2\nAs discussed previously, the path of the current leaving the transformer secondary windings changes\nduring the positive and negative half-cycles of the parallel capacitor voltage, due to the effect of the\nrectifiers allowing current to conduct only in single direction. During the positive half-cycle interval, D1\nis forward biased and permits the rectifier current iR to supply the load RL1. During the negative half-cycle\nthe top rectifier is reverse-biased and D2 supports power transfer to load RL2.\nIf the output filter capacitors are assumed to be sufficiently large so as to maintain a constant voltage on\nboth outputs over a switching period, their contribution to the dynamics is given by:\nEPE 2005 Dresden P.3\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL-LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\n2005 - Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.3\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\ndVCfl 'RI VcfI dVCf 2 1R2 Vcf 2\ndt Cf 1 Cf IRLl dt Cf 2 Cf2RL2 (2)\nAs discussed, during interval t1 -- t2 (see Fig. 2(b)) the parallel resonant capacitor voltage is clamped to\noutput voltage, vcji during the positive half-cycle, and conversely, to -vc during the negative half-cycle,\ndue to the action of the rectifiers. By noting that there will be negligible current flowing through Cp\nduring these periods, the rectifier input voltage is dependent on the direction of the current leaving the\nresonant tank inductances, i.e. iL =iLs- iLp The relevant coupling terms are therefore obtained by\nequating voltages at either side of the rectifier, for each respective half-cycle, as follows:\nVCp- sgn(i )(VOUtl Vdiode) sgn(iL )(VcfI Vdiode)\nVCP2 sgn(iL)(Vout2 + vd-od,) sgn(iL)(Vcf 2 + Vdiode)\nAssuming a constant rectifier on-state voltage, differentiating (3) gives:\ndvcp\ngn\ndv f dvCp2 dvcf2\nLsgn(i) =sgn(iL)\ndt dt dit dt (4)\nConsider the rectifier current, iR2, is zero during the positive half-cycle of the parallel capacitor voltage.\nEquations (1) and (2) can be substituted into (4) and solved for the rectifier current iRI,\nC iC (iL sgn(i)vcfl\nsRgn(L )CPI + Cf Cp + Cf R ) (5)\nThis leads to the following coupling equations describing the rectifier currents within each half of a\nswitching cycle:\nC Cf (is-ic -i g( ci {sn(L)CPl f (I + pLIR for v\noutl + Vdiode\n0 for vcp1 <Voutl + Vdiode\nCp2Cf jiL-i sgn(Q )'Lcf 2\niR2 sgn(L)Cp2 + Cf2 Cp2 2 foout2 + Vdiode (6)\n0 for vCp2 <Vout2 + Vdiode\nAssuming the effect of transformer output leakage inductances are negligibly small i.e. Ls, Cs, Lp and Cp\ndominate behaviour, the voltage across Lp is assumed to be a reflection of the voltages across Cpl and Cp2,\nand the state vector for the parallel inductor current in the fast sub-system (see Equation (1)) simplifies to\nVLp = vCP. It is noted that Cpl and Cp2 charging\/discharging currents are similar, implying that current\nflowing from the primary side of the transformer is equally shared between them. In this case, the shunt\nconnection of the parallel resonant capacitors can also be used to conveniently include the effects of the\ntransformer output stray capacitances or output rectifier diode junction capacitances. The state variable\nequations for the parallel resonant capacitor voltage (1) can be simplified to:\ndvCpl iLs iLp iR dVCp2 iLs iLp iR\ndt 2Cp1 dt 2Cp2 (7)\nThe state-variable equations are readily employed in MATLAB\/SIMULINK to investigate the behaviour\nof an example dual-loads converter when subject to asymmetrical input excitation, with balanced output\nloads. The converter is powered from 30V DC-link. Model parameters for the simulations are given in\nTable I. A resulting plot of the steady-state output voltage characteristics, Vo01t1 and Vo0,t2, as a function of\nswitching frequency and duty-cycle ratio, is given in Fig. 3 (the secondaries of the transformer have\nEPE 2005 Dresden ISBN P.4\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL-LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\n2005 - Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.4\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\nidentical turns ratios, and the parallel resonant capacitances are the same). From Fig. 3, it is evident that\nfor operation above resonance, the sum of the output voltages applied to the loads increases as the\noperating frequency tends to the effective resonant frequency, for fixed values of duty ratio. Furthermore,\nfor 50% duty ratio, giving symmetric square-wave excitation of the tank, the converter delivers identical\nvoltages to both high- and low-side outputs, for fixed operating frequencies, as expected.\nFor a given a particular operating frequency, a decrease in the duty ratio, from 50%, is seen to deliver\nmore energy from the resonant tank to energize output VOut,X thereby yielding a correspondingly higher\noutput voltage, and power. Conversely, increasing the duty ratio beyond 50% is seen to deliver more\npower to the secondary winding to support a higher V01,,2. From this characteristic, it is clear that, for\nbalanced loads, the voltage and power distribution to each output can be independently influenced by\nsuitable choice of duty ratio and switching frequency. Furthermore, it can be seen that the slope of the\ncurves, Figs. 4(a) and (b), are greater for lower values of switching frequency. This implies that when a\nlarge difference between the output voltages is required, the converter should be operated close to\nresonance, leading to high efficiency operation, and zero voltage switching. However, this also means\nthat the tank components are subjected to higher electrical stresses.\nTable I Converter model parameters\nParameters Values\nResonant frequency, f0 (kHz) 130\nResonant capacitance ratio, C. 0.03\nResonant inductance ratio, L. 0.01\nSeries load quality factor, Qopl 6\nFigure 5(a) shows the relative voltage distributions as a function of the ratio of the input voltage duty, and\nload quality factor, Qpi. It can be seen that the slope of the characteristic is relatively independent of the\nquality factor, for high Qpl, although the attainable difference between the output voltages is seen to be\ngreater for low values of load quality factor. Hence, operation with low Q0p, should be chosen to facilitate\nlarge voltage differences, as opposed to use of high Q0p, to facilitate sinusoidal tank currents and voltages.\nMoreover, low Q0p, conditions implies that the output voltage vs. frequency behaviour of the converter has\na 'flatter' characteristic, and a greater range of switching frequencies are required to regulate the output\nvoltage when the converter is subjected to variations in DC-link voltage or load, thereby requiring greater\ncontroller effort and bandwidth for tracking control [6]. A trade off is therefore required in the selection\nof the key converter parameters.\n14\n12\n~\nFrequency (kHz) D Duty(%)\nFig. 3 Output voltages distribution vs. switching frequency and duty ratio\nEPE 2005 Dresden P.S\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL-LOADS LCLC R-ESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\n2005 - Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.5\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\nIt is instructive to show the impact of converter parameters on the attainable voltage distributions. Fig.\n5(b) therefore shows an example of the resulting voltage distribution, as a function of duty ratio, as\nresonant capacitance ratio C, is varied. It can be seen, in particular, that the slope of the characteristic is\ngreater for low ratios of resonant capacitance. Hence, it is instructive to choose a low value for C, ratio\nduring the design phase. However, a choice of low parallel capacitance means the input-output voltage\ncharacteristic exhibits a reduced resonant peak, and consequently, the voltage boosting capability of the\nconverter is limited. Furthermore, the input-output voltage conversion ratio, at the effective resonant\nfrequency of the tank, is consequently lower, and the resulting converter therefore appears more suitable\nfor step-down DC-DC applications.\nRerna nt friq uency- 1 301lz\n1 4 X\n11\n20\nDuty Q\n(a) (b)\nFig. 4 Asymmetrical voltage distribution: a) Output voltages deviation, b) relative voltage distribution\nAt resrwant ftequeny\nm. 1.3_-..\n= 1, _-\n0 1 _.\nW ozs ..\nI\no.I\n50\n8so Dul()\n(a) (b)\nFig. 5 Converter characteristics as a function of a) duty ratio and Q0p, and, b) duty ratio and C,\nFigures 3 to 5 have established that a chosen distribution of output voltages (with balanced loads) can be\nmaintained using a combination of switching frequency and duty ratio control, so long as the maximum\ndeliverable voltage, and input voltage vs. input current phase angle, are not exceeded.

However, high efficiency soft-switching operation cannot be sustained if the converter is\nEPE 2005 Dresden P.6\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL-LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVF-RTERS FOSTER Martin\n-1\nAl t\n-.\nQ,\n0\nM,\nm\n0\n4)\n,2t\n2\nv\nw\n40\n2005 - Dresden ISBN: 90-75815-08-5 P.6\nDIGITAL CONTROL OF DUAL LOADS LCLC RESONANT CONVERTERS FOSTER Martin\noperated at resonance, to obtain the maximum output voltage difference.

At\nfrequencies less than the tank resonant frequency, the input impedance of the tank network Zi, is\ndominated by the tank capacitance. Hence, the input switch current fundamental component leads the\ninput voltage and the resonant tank presents an effective capacitive load. This provides Zero Current\nSwitching (ZCS) forAl\\,8i <0. When the resonant converter is operated above resonance, Zero Voltage\nSwitching (ZVS) occurs, and the resonant tank presents an effective inductive load to the half-bridge\nswitches, and the switch current lags the switch voltage.\nAt the effective resonant frequency, coo under asymmetric square-wave input voltage excitation, the input\nvoltage lags the first harmonic of the input current, A,8ipl < 0 when the duty cycle falls below 50%-see\nFig. 7.

However, this will induce higher\ncirculating currents that increases conduction losses and contributes to thermal problems. Increasing the\nswitching frequency also compromises the ability of the converter to deliver wide voltage differences\nbetween the high- and low-side outputs. The converter should therefore be ideally operated at the\nminimum switching frequency, above resonance, that can achieve ZVS.\nin In\nPin ''-Pi'i-l\n(a) (b)\nFig. 7 Waveforms of V1i, v1(l) and iL, at (a) D=0.5 (AA,6 =A\/,b) and (b) D=0.3 (A,8i,< A\/On\nClosed-loop Control and Experimental Realisation\nResults of the possible output voltage distributions available from the dual-output converter, Table II,\nhave demonstrated the dependence of the output voltages on both the duty-ratio and switching frequency.\nThe objective, for control purposes, is to force the converter outputs to the set points in the presence of\nline voltage and load disturbances.

It can be seen that the converter voltages converge\nrapidly to the reference values, with an initial overshoot of -10%. The overshoot is attributable to initial\nsaturation of the integral action of the controller. Nevertheless, the response of the controller is deemed\nsatisfactory in each case.\n,h1 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ V 5Vis\nj l~~~~~~~~~\nC C\n4 df T X 4 XTme _s) TimeX (X\n2\ninput votages (a VDC=15V V0~~1=5, V0~~23.3V; b)VD=OV V 3=V,V.3V33\nexplored.
