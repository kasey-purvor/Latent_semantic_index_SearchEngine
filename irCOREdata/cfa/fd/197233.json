As time is short, most researchers often end up\nusing familiar resources, which are not always the best or\nmost relevant, while the developers and funders of\nunder-utilized but valuable resources essentially waste\ntime and money. What is required is a solution that helps\nto maximize the usefulness of each resource to the overall\ncommunity. At present, approaches are being developed to\nconstruct two types of registry. One type, \u2018databases of\ndatabases\u2019, deal with describing the contents and other\nmetadata about databases. The other type, web service\nregistries, deal with the explicit description of services avail-\nable at particular sites (not always databases). We present\nthe two areas separately, but ultimately we expect solu-\ntions to arrive that merge the two approaches.\nRegistries of databases\nComprehensive, top-level registries of biological re-\nsources are currently provided by the Nucleic Acids\nResearch Molecular Biology Database Collection,1\nthe BioMedCentral Catalog of Databases on the\nWeb (http:\/\/databases.biomedcentral.com) and the\nBioinformatics.ca Links Directory.2 However, they do not\ncollect extensive metadata beyond a brief description of\nthe resource and URL, can only be browsed by the category\neach registry has assigned or searched by the resource\nname, and lack much of the detailed information that the\ncommunity requires. A number of projects [e.g. CASIMIR\n(Coordination and Sustainability of Mouse Informatics\nResources)3 and ENFIN4] have identified this problem and\nare producing \u2018database of databases\u2019 (registries) for their\nfield of expertise.5\nA registry of resources needs to be more than just a list\nof databases and textual descriptions to be useful to the\nbiological and bioinformatics communities. To achieve its\naim of helping scientists find the most relevant resource\nfor their needs, it needs to provide at the very least brows-\ning and searching by the type of data contained in each\nresource, i.e. the biological scope of the resource. A typical\napproach, as used by all the registries described above and\nthe MRB (Mouse Resource Browser)6 registry developed by\na number of the authors of this article, is for a community\nto define a list of categories (a controlled vocabulary) that\ncovers their scientific domain and then to tag each resource\nwith one or more of these terms. Use of existing and newly\ndeveloped ontologies for these tags would certainly facili-\ntate future interoperability of the various registries being\ndeveloped.\nWhile developing MRB, user feedback suggested that\nit would be helpful if users could go beyond simple cat-\negorization of the scope of resources to discover metadata\ndescribing database operations and functionality. We\ntherefore set out to capture the utility, accessibility and\nease of use of a resource, along with its potential interoper-\nability with other tools and databases. The types of ques-\ntions that we wanted to be able to answer from this\nmetadata included whether the resource uses automated\nor manual curation, how often it updates and whether\nthere is a way to track back to different versions, does it\nprovide good technical documentation and user support,\ndoes it use recognized standards to record and structure\nits data, and finally does it go beyond simple web browsing\nto allow programmatic access and output in standard\nformats?\nData are always easier to capture and search if a consist-\nent standard is used and we therefore developed a\nDatabase Description Framework (DDF; Table 1) as part of\nthe CASIMIR project. Although produced for the MRB, the\nDDF is generically applicable to any biological database and\ncan be adapted for the requirements of any biological com-\nmunity. For each heading or category, there is a three-tier\nassessment criterion, a number chosen for simplicity and\nease of use. The aim of the DDF is not to make \u2018value judge-\nments\u2019 about a resource, but to summarise what it does and\nwhat functionalities it supports, with the categories simply\nreflecting the degree of complexity or sophistication of the\ndatabase. What is useful or relevant for some databases\nneed not be so for others, and each needs to be assessed\nin terms of its own remit and user community. The DDF is\nalso intended to be helpful in disseminating and support-\ning good database practice, in providing backing for re-\nsources aspiring to improve the levels of their service, and\nin giving objective criteria that can be used by external\nassessors to measure a resource\u2019s progress towards their\nstated goals.\ncaBIG, the NCI Cancer Bioinformatics grid7 has produced\na similar framework for capturing resource metadata but\nwith a stronger focus on the technical assessment of the\nresources that wish to participate in the project. As caBIG\nhas a well-defined set of tasks and a user community tied to\nthe specific vision and funding, their categories and levels\nare less generic than those in the DDF and more focused on\nassessing whether databases reach a required level of inter-\noperability to interact with the other components of this\nparticular project.\nRegistries of web services\nAs well as capturing the scope and database practices of\nresources, registries need to be explicit about the modes of\nprogrammatic access that databases provide (e.g. web\nservices) as these are increasingly used to build database\nnetworks and cyberinfrastructure.8\u201310 This technical infor-\nmation is often hard to find in publications or even on\ndatabase web sites, but can radically change the strategy\nadopted by bioinformaticians needing to access the\ndatabase\u2014for example, integration into automated or\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPage 2 of 5\nOriginal article Database, Vol. 2010, Article ID baq014, doi:10.1093\/database\/baq014\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n at Leicester University Library on June 20, 2011\ndatabase.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nsemi-automated work flows using Taverna11 such as that\ndeveloped by CASIMIR.12 Unfortunately, traditional web-\nservice description languages such as WSDL do not\nprovide the required detail on the biological context of\nthe inputs and outputs of each service to allow automated\ndata and service integration. Biocatalogue13 and its prede-\ncessor, the EMBRACE service registry14, address this lack of\nsemantics by providing sites for the registration, curation,\ndiscovery and monitoring of web services for the whole\nbiological community. Curation of information about web\nservices is open to anyone and uses a combination of free\ntext, tags, ontology terms and example values to describe\nwhat each service does, the type of web service (REST,\nSOAP, soaplab) and in particular the input and outputs in\nterms of what type of biological data and data formats are\nexpected. Biocatalogue clearly addresses a vital require-\nment of the community and already some 1173 services\nhave been annotated, despite the project only running\nfor just over a year. Having a single, well-designed solution\nrather than multiple competing efforts is likely to improve\nfurther uptake, and we propose that all registries of\ndatabases utilize Biocatalogue to annotate the services pro-\nvided by their resources rather than separately performing\nthis task.\nDissemination issues and solutions\nCapturing metadata as described for the DDF or the\nBiocatalogue project is not easy. Our initial DDF metadata\nfor over 220 resources was captured as part of a detailed\nMRB questionnaire sent to each resource, and active\nmanual curation had to be used to fill in the gaps in re-\nsponses. This is expensive and time-consuming and, after\nthe first pass, there is a requirement to keep the captured\ndata up to date, and this is not easily met.\nTo eliminate the cost of a central curation effort, it\nwould be much better if each resource curated their own\nmetadata and made it accessible to the wider scientific\ncommunity. As an example of this, we produced a DDF\nextension to the Drupal content management system\n(http:\/\/drupal.org), which allows curators to log-in and cat-\negorize their databases in terms of DDF categories and\nTable 1.

The resulting metadata is\nthen browsable and searchable either through a web inter-\nface or programmatically through RESTful web services. An\nexample deployment is viewable at www.casimir.org.uk\/ca\nsimir_ddf (Figure 1) and is currently populated with the\nmetadata for the MRB project. We encourage interested\nreaders to visit our site and for maintainers of resources\nto curate their metadata using it. The Drupal framework\nis easily extensible to allow curation of other data asso-\nciated with each resource, so allowing the production of\na customisable community registry. The system is expected\nto be of great value to communities developing registry\nresources or individual informaticians wanting to establish\nquickly which features a database provides (the software is\nfreely available under an open-source license). The REST\nweb services allow a central DDF portal to be established\noffering the collection and sharing of data from individual\ndatabase registries as well as avoiding redundancy in\ncuration efforts.\nBiocatalogue have used a combination of central and\ncommunity curation from the outset to capture data on\nweb services and the large number of services already\ndescribed is testament to such an approach. Again, the pro-\nvision of easy to use web tools that suggest particular tags\nand ontology terms to use in the annotation increases the\nlikelihood of achieving a high level of community engage-\nment and annotation quality.\nCommunity curation requires pro-active participation.\nCommunities need to acknowledge; (i) a central site\nwhere they can find relevant resources would be useful,\nand; (ii) the only practical means of achieving this is for\neach database to self-curate its entry using a clearly articu-\nlated and standardized set of benchmarks and tools such as\nprovided by the DDF and Biocatalogue solutions. Individual\nresources would also benefit from this small amount of cur-\nation effort as the central registry will direct users to\nthem, who might not previously have known about their\nresource. Although the creators and maintainers of a\nresource are best placed to describe the associated meta-\ndata, a self-curation approach can raise data quality issues,\nbut these should be minimized if the annotation tools are\nwell designed i.e. fast and easy to use, with clear descrip-\ntions of what is being asked for, and responses presented as\na lists of terms rather than free text. However, even with a\nwell-designed annotation tool, registries are still likely to\nrequire some central curation for validating submitted data\n(e.g. the DDF tool allows administrator level access to check\nnew submissions).\nIn summary, there is now a clear need for registries to be\nbuilt that address biological categorization of databases\nFigure 1. The DDF query and annotation tool. This tool allows any user to browse a set of resources that have been annotated\nusing the DDF categories. Searches for resources by DDF category and level are also possible. In addition, resource maintainers\ncan log-in and edit their existing annotations or annotate a new resource using a simple web form. This tool is freely available\nand easy to install for other communities that wish to create their own registry of resources.\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPage 4 of 5\nOriginal article Database, Vol. 2010, Article ID baq014, doi:10.1093\/database\/baq014\n.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n at Leicester University Library on June 20, 2011\ndatabase.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nand services, annotate any services provided and capture\nmetadata on database best practises. Considerable progress\nhas been made on standardizing the capture of each of\nthese by such approaches as the DDF and Biocatalogue,\nbut the community would benefit from coordination to\nproduce full registries combining all these approaches.\nHowever, the value of a standard is dependent on its\nuptake by the community as can be seen, for example, in\nthe MIBBI family of minimal information standards.15\nUptake of a standard is, of course, as much a social issue\nas one of producing the right technologies for the commu-\nnity. Here, support from funding agencies and journals will\nbe vital in establishing the practice of publishing database\nand services metadata. All curators can enhance the value\nof their databases by posting a minimal amount of infor-\nmation about their resource on a community site. The task\nhas minimal cost, but will provide considerable value to\ninvestigators, database developers, informaticians and\nfunding agencies.\nFunding\nThe work described above was supported by Seventh\nFramework Programme of the European Commission\ncontracts to CASIMIR (LSHG-CT-2006-037811) and ENFIN\n(LSHG-CT-2005-518254).
