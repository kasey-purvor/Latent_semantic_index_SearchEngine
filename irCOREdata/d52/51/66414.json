E-mail:\nroberto.emparan@cern.ch\n1 Introduction\nThe idea that spacetime may have more than four dimensions, with some of them being\nmacroscopically large, has recently become an attractive scenario where many a model has\nbeen proposed. The common defining features are, on the one hand, the presence of a\nthree-brane where the Standard Model is confined, and on the other hand, a bulk where\ngravity propagates. Other fields may live in either brane or bulk, as long as their current\nundetectability is consistent with experimental bounds.\nThe idea dates back at least to [1], but, at the risk of oversimplification, we may identify\ntwo main lines in the recent developments: one following the works of Arkani-Hamed et al\n(ADD) [2], and the other that of Randall and Sundrum (RS) [3, 4]. Each of these seeks a\nnovel, geometrical, resolution of the hierarchy problem \u2013 the volume (effective or real) of\nthe additional dimensions providing the hierarchy between the Planck and standard model\nscales. Works under the latter, RS, class typically consider the brane-world to be a defect of\nlow codimension, say one or two, i.e., a \u2018domain wall\u2019 (as in the original RS scenario) or a\n\u2018cosmic string\u2019, [5, 6] and explicitly include the self-gravity (backreaction) of the brane into\nthe bulk of, typically, an anti-de Sitter spacetime. By contrast, the scenario proposed by\nADD neglects the self-gravity of the brane, and regards the number of extra dimensions, n,\nas essentially an adjustable parameter. In these cases, typically, the extra dimensions have\nto be compactified in order to recover the four-dimensional law of gravity at least down to\ndistances above the experimental bounds [7]. It is quite possible that in the near future such\nscenarios with n < 3 extra dimensions will be ruled out.\nThere are in fact good reasons why the bending of spacetime produced by the brane\nis dealt with so differently in these two kinds of scenarios. Typically, a localised defect of\ncodimension one or two manifests its self-gravity in global features of its spacetime; this\nis because the intrinsic spatial directions of the defect do not participate in the gravita-\ntional interaction, and the symmetries of the defect therefore mean that gravity is effectively\npropagating only in the directions orthogonal to it, and of course gravity in 1 + 1 or 2 + 1\ndimensions does not have any propagating degrees of freedom. Spacetime exterior to the\ndefect is therefore locally flat, and the gravitational \u2018field\u2019 shows up only globally. For the\nstring, this is the well-known conical deficit, and for the wall, the spacetime consists of two\nportions of flat spacetime (the interior of an accelerating bubble) glued across their bound-\naries. Viewed from the frame of the wall itself, the metric ceases to be static, and inertial\nobservers appear to accelerate away from the wall. At the location of the \u2018core\u2019 of the string\nor wall, one finds, in the limit of vanishing thickness, a rather mild distributional singularity,\neither a finite discontinuity in the extrinsic curvature for the wall, or a simple apex of the\ncone spacetime.\nSuch global, long range effects of low codimension branes are highly restrictive if one\n2\nwants to compactify the extra dimensions. This is unsurprising in the case of the domain\nwall, since the wall spacetime itself has compact spatial sections; \u2018standard\u2019 compactification\nwith domain walls requires extra bulk fields [8], or walls with negative tension [3]. Com-\npactification with cosmic strings on the other hand is also problematic, due to the global\ndeficit angle. One can, in analogy with the wall, introduce a negative tension string for\ncompactification on a torus, or indeed consider a global, rather than local, string [5, 6] which\neffectively introduces a bulk field in the guise of the Goldstone boson of the broken global\nsymmetry. In addition however, one can consider compactifications on surfaces of positive\ntotal curvature using the deficit angle to provide the requisite closure [9]. However, the fact\nthat no strong curvatures appear near the sources implies that the thin brane limit poses\nno problem, and hence the thickness of the brane can be neglected to a good approxima-\ntion. The propagation of fields both in the bulk and on the brane is very weakly affected by\nwhatever the internal microstructure of the brane may be. In other words, the low energy\ndynamics, in particular the gravity induced on the brane, is quite independent of any details\nabout the core structure.\nBranes of codimension n = 3, or higher, look in this respect qualitatively different. If\ntheir sources are well localized in the extra dimensions, then so is the gravitational field\nthey produce: a localized object of codimension n creates a gravitational potential that falls\noff at large transverse distance as 1\/rn\u22122. Then, sufficiently far away from the brane, the\ngeometry of spacetime is hardly affected by the presence of the brane. So, with such branes,\ncompactification of the extra dimensions presents no special difficulties, for as long as the\nthickness of the brane is sufficiently smaller than the size of the extra dimensions. On the\nother hand, the backreaction effects are now shifted to the region close to the brane. Since\nthe source is localized, in the limit of zero thickness it can be expected to develop a naked\nsingularity, where the curvature diverges (horizons surrounding the entire brane are to be\navoided). This singularity will be smoothed out by the physical core of the brane, and the\ndistance at which this happens depends on the specific details of the core model. This leaves\nopen the door to the possibility that low energy physics acquires a strong dependence on the\nbrane thickness, in contrast to what happened for thin domain walls and cosmic strings.\nFor a typical topological defect, such as, say, a cosmic string, the tension and the thickness\nare independent quantities, being determined by different combinations of the parameters of\nthe Lagrangian (the Higgs self coupling and vev). So there is the possibility that the param-\neters that control the brane thickness and brane tension, call them rb and r0 respectively,\ntake on very different values. Such an effect, which is mostly inconsequential for domain\nwalls and strings, will allow higher codimension branes to generate a hierarchy between the\nfundamental scale and the scale of gravity on the brane. As we will see below, for rb much\nsmaller than r0 the relation between the gravitational couplings in the bulk and on the brane\n3\ntakes the form\nG4 \u2243 G4+n\nV0\n(\nrb\nr0\n)n\u22122\n2\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn+2\n, (1.1)\nwhere V0 is the volume of the extra dimensions, and we assume r0 to be sufficiently smaller\n(though not necessarily very much smaller) than V\n1\/n\n0 .\nEquation (1.1) differs from the standard result from Kaluza-Klein reduction by the factor\ninvolving the brane parameters r0 and rb, which is absent if the self-gravity of the brane is\nneglected. This factor is a consequence of the warping induced by the brane in its vicinity,\nand as we see, can have an important effect on the strength of gravity on the brane. An\nextreme possibility is that the volume of the extra dimensions be on the same scale as the\nfundamental scale (set by G4+n) \u2013 say, around the TeV scale \u2013 and the small value of G4 be\nattained by having rb\/r0 small enough.\nHence, even if the starting point resembles the scenario of ADD in that we have a higher\ndimensional brane in a compact, empty bulk, the resolution (or better, reformulation) of the\nhierarchy problem in the scenario we have described is perhaps more akin to that proposed\nin RS1 [3]. As in RS1, the hierarchy is generated by the curvature of the spacetime near\nthe brane, and not by a large internal volume. Also, the mass of the Kaluza-Klein states\nis set by V\n\u22121\/n\n0 . So, if the latter is on the TeV scale, the large multiplicity of very light\nKaluza-Klein states that is typical of scenarios with large extra dimensions is avoided.\nNote, however, some important differences (besides the different number of dimensions):\nin RS1 the hierarchy is generated by an exponential factor, whereas here we only have a\npower law. Hence, an \u201cunnaturally\u201d large number has to be introduced by hand. Explaining\nthis factor requires a more fundamental theory (as happens with the large volume factor\nin the ADD scenario). Also, in this model there is only one kind of brane, one of positive\ntension, which can be regarded as a \u201cTeV-brane.\u201d Gravity becomes Planck-size away from the\nbrane, where the warping becomes negligible. Finally, the way the warping of spacetime is\ngenerated involves in a crucial way the structure of the brane core, in particular its thickness.\nThis, as far as we know, is a novel feature in brane-world scenarios.\nRequiring rb\/r0 to be small enough to generate the whole hierarchy between the TeV\nand Planck scales is perhaps an extreme situation \u2013 say, for an eleven dimensional universe,\nn = 7, a value rb\/r0 \u223c 10\u221215 would be required. In particular, one has to deal with the very\nlarge curvatures induced near the brane. But, at any rate, the effect encoded in eq. (1.1)\ncan have a significant effect in ADD scenarios, by altering the extra volume required to\ngenerate the hierarchy without changing the energies at which Kaluza-Klein states start to\nbe excited, the effect being larger for higher values of n. One could envisage, e.g., having rb\non the fundamental scale, and r0 being somewhat larger, which would enhance the hierarchy\nfactor for a given volume.\n4\nThe setup we have considered is a minimalistic one, designed to incorporate the effect\nof self-gravity of the brane-world into scenarios like the one of ADD with three or more\nextra dimensions. To this end, we consider a brane-world with the following features. First,\nwe shall not specify any mechanism that gives rise to the brane. The brane will simply\nbe a thin source (in the limit, a distributional source) of stress-energy, extended over three\nspatial directions. It is not clear whether field-theoretical topological defects can be used to\nmodel this \u2013 to date the only work on higher codimension brane worlds either uses global\ndefects, [10], or is non-specific about the brane core, [11], indeed there is some dispute as to\nwhether one can smooth the core without introducing long range effects [12]. Nonetheless,\nthe solutions we use as a model for the self-gravitating higher codimension defect, [13], are\nqualitatively the same even in the presence of Coulomb fields, and so from the viewpoint\nof this paper, we regard this issue as being outside the regime of low energy physics. We\nshall content ourselves if the singularity can be smoothed, in principle, by a generic brane\ncore. For simplicity, the only bulk field with non-vanishing background values will be taken\nto be the gravitational one, without a bulk cosmological constant. We shall also require the\nthree-brane to admit a Poincare\u00b4-invariant ground state.\nSome of these assumptions might need to be dropped for more fully realistic model-\nbuilding, moreover, modification of some of these assumptions may give rise to qualitative\nchanges. For example, branes in string theory include a variety of bulk fields which typically\ndo not vanish for the background. In fact, no branes such as we require are known to exist in\nstring theory, and its actual p-branes do not share many of the features we have discussed.\nNevertheless, as we will argue near the end, the effect that gives rise to (1.1) is rather generic\nfor branes. Hence we think it is important to study the consequences of this simplest brane-\nworld model. The effects we describe, and the way we deal with the problems posed by the\nsingularities are likely to be useful also in other settings.\nOne final aspect to be mentioned is that, in this framework, gravity is in no way localized\nnear the brane. This is as in the conventional ADD scenario, and in order to recover four-\ndimensional gravity at large distances on the brane, we shall assume the extra dimensions\nto be compactified. No specific compactification scheme will be considered. It might be\nthat a modification of the model allows for localization of gravity on the brane, e.g., by\nthe inclusion of a cosmological constant, or otherwise. Actually, there have already been\nattempts at this. In [11], a search for self-gravitating, strictly local defects, such as we\nconsider here, which yield finite gravity on the brane without compactification, resulted in\na negative outcome. Addition of extra bulk fields appeared to remedy the situation. There\nare several points of contact between [11] and our analysis here, but the focus is somewhat\ndifferent. Besides this, in [14, 15] a model was proposed with a brane in a flat Minkowski\nspace with an arbitrary number of dimensions. It was claimed that the model achieved\n5\na strong localization of gravity. Self-gravity of the brane was neglected in that work, but\na natural way of incorporating it would be along the lines described in this paper. More\nrecently, other related recent work has appeared in [16].\n2 Three-branes of codimension n\nOur purpose is to describe three-brane geometries in 4 + n dimensions. In the bulk of\nspacetime only gravity is present, which is described by the 4 + n dimensional Einstein-\nHilbert action. In addition, there will be a source of tension \u03bb along the four brane-world\ncoordinates x\u00b5. This source we take to be localized \u2013 as a first instance, we take it to be\ndistributional.\nSince we require that the brane admits a four-dimensional Poincare\u00b4 invariant vacuum,\nfor a single brane in a non-compact space we take the ansatz\nds2 = A2(r)\u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd +B2(r)dr2 + C2(r)r2d\u21262n\u22121 , (2.1)\nwith \u00b5, \u03bd = 0, . . . , 3.\nThe cases n = 1, 2 correspond to the well-known domain wall and local cosmic string\ngeometries. For the domain wall, in an otherwise empty Minkowski space there are no\nPoincare\u00b4 invariant umbilic surfaces (K\u00b5\u03bd \u221d g\u00b5\u03bd) with nonzero extrinsic curvature, so walls\nwith the above symmetries require a bulk negative cosmological constant or additional bulk\nfields. For n = 2, the solution is analogous to a cosmic string, which creates a conical deficit\nangle. In this case A = B = C = 1, and the transverse angle is identified with period\n2\u03c0(1\u2212 4G6\u03bb).\nOur interest lies in n \u2265 3. For these cases, the equations have been solved in [13], with\nthe result\nA = f\n\u2212 1\n4\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn+2 , B = f\n\u2212 1\nn\u22122\n(\nn\u22123\n2\n\u2212\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn+2\n)\n, C = f\n1\nn\u22122\n(\n1\n2\n+\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn+2\n)\n, (2.2)\nwith\nf = 1 +\n(\nr0\nr\n)n\u22122\n. (2.3)\nFor example, for the case n = 3, one gets A = f\u22121\/2\n\u221a\n10, B = f 2\/\n\u221a\n10, and C = f 1\/2+2\/\n\u221a\n10.\nThe parameter r0 is directly related to the brane tension. The relation between them can\nbe obtained by either reading the energy-momentum tensor of the brane from the Einstein\nequations near r = 0, or by a computation of the brane tension in an ADM-like approach\n[17], focusing on the asymptotic region in the direction transverse to the brane. In this way\nthe stress tensor is computed to be T \u03bd\u00b5 = \u03bb\u03b4\n\u03bd\n\u00b5, with\n\u03bb =\n\u221a\n(n\u2212 1)(n+ 2) \u2126n\u22121\n32\u03c0Gn+4\nrn\u221220 , (2.4)\n6\nwhere \u2126n\u22121 is the area of a unit (n\u22121)\u2212sphere. Since the space in the directions transverse\nto the brane is empty, static and asymptotically flat, this has to be the same as the tension\nfrom the source at r = 0.\nThe non-analytic form of the metric coefficients is already an indication of the presence\nof singularities. Let us analyze them in more detail. First of all, the curvature grows to\ninfinity as one approaches r = 0. Given the highly localized nature of the source, a naked\nsingularity was indeed expected. This singularity we identify with the core of the brane.\nIt was shown in [13] that, quite generally, an adequate (unspecified) choice of core model\nshould smooth out the singularity. We will assume that smoothing out the core has the\neffect that the solution (2.2) is valid only down to a radius r = rb, and that for r < rb the\nfactors A,B,C take values not too different from their value at r = rb. Hence, the metric\ninduced on the brane is A2(rb)\u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd .\nThe space near r = 0 is highly distorted: notice that A(r) shrinks to zero at r = 0. Since\nA(r) measures the proper size in the directions parallel to the brane, we see that the brane at\nr = 0 has zero size! The singularity is at a finite proper radial distance,\n\u222b\n0 drB. In contrast,\nthe size of the spheres Sn\u22121, rC, diverge at r = 0. The latter implies a significant departure\nfrom the situation in flat space, where the transverse spheres Sn\u22121 shrink to zero at the\norigin. In the present case, it means that the three-brane is actually delocalized over these\nspheres. This delocalization was present also in [11]. Note that the parameter rb associated\nto the thickness of the brane is not a proper radius. As a matter of fact, having a small rb\ndoes not necessarily imply that the brane is thin: If the thickness is measured by the \u2018area\nradius\u2019, rC(r), then small rb means that the brane is actually a thick one! Nevertheless, we\nwill continue to refer to rb as the \u2018brane thickness\u2019.\nAt large distances from the brane the geometry becomes asymptotically flat, as it typi-\ncally does for localized objects of codimension n \u2265 3. Hence, the extra dimensions can be\ncompactified in much the same way as in the absence of the brane, if the compactification\nscale Rc is sufficiently larger than r0 (or rb). In that case, at distances less than Rc the\ngeometry will be well approximated by (2.2). To take the compactification effects into ac-\ncount, in the following we will simply assume that the transverse radial distance is cutoff at\na large distance, r \u2264 Rc. The ratio r0\/Rc may not need to be too large: one or two orders\nof magnitude may be enough.\nWe end this section by mentioning the relationship between the brane solutions of (2.2)\nand pointlike solutions to Einstein-scalar gravity in (n + 1) dimensions. If we compactify\nthe spatial brane directions a` la Kaluza-Klein, then the remaining spacetime would be of the\nform\nds2 = \u2212f\u03b1dt2 + f\u03b2dr2 + r2f\u03b3d\u21262n\u22121 (2.5)\n7\n(in Einstein conformal frame), where,\n\u03b1 = \u22121\n2\n\u221a\nn+ 2\nn\u2212 1 , \u03b2 = \u2212\n1\nn\u2212 2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edn\u2212 3\u2212 1\n2\n\u221a\nn+ 2\nn\u2212 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , \u03b3 = 1\nn\u2212 2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1 + 1\n2\n\u221a\nn+ 2\nn\u2212 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 .\nThese are static, spherically symmetric solutions to (n+1)-dimensional gravity coupled to a\nscalar field, the scalar coming from the spatial volume of the three-brane. For example, for\nn = 3 the solutions describe the singular pointlike objects of [18] (see also [19] for a general\ndiscussion).\n3 Propagation of scalars\nThe brane thickness and brane tension parameters, rb and r0, are in principle independent\nof each other, and fixed by the core model for the brane. We will be mostly interested in\nhaving rb \u226a r0.\nIn this case, we have to show that one can consistently define the propagation of fields in\nthis background for arbitrarily small values of rb, in particular for rb \u2192 0. In this respect, the\nproblem is reminiscent of that of an electron in a Coulomb potential (the hydrogen atom):\neven if the source of the potential is a nucleus of finite size (the analog here of a brane of\nfinite thickness), it is possible to solve for a singular pointlike source and obtain sensible\nresults by discarding solutions that are badly behaved at the origin. The Sturm-Liouville\nboundary value problem is then well defined2, and unitarity is preserved. After this, the\nfinite nucleus size can be treated as a small perturbation. Similarly here, the finite thickness\nof the brane will result in small corrections to the propagation of the field in the bulk.\nWe shall study the propagation of a massless, minimally coupled scalar field \u03a6 in the\nbackground of (2.2). Gravitons share many of the properties of these scalars, but also\npresent important peculiarities of themselves, and will be the subject of the next section.\nOur analysis here will share some technical aspects with the ones in [5, 11], although the\nsingularities in those cases lay away from the core of the brane.\nThe equation to study is then\n24+n\u03a6 =\n1\u221a\u2212g\u2202a\n(\u221a\u2212ggab\u2202b\u03a6) = 0 , (3.1)\nin the curved background of (2.2). Given the symmetries of the background, we separate\nvariables as\n\u03a6 = eip\u00b5x\n\u00b5\nZlmi(\u2126)\u03c6ml(r) , (3.2)\n2One needs also to impose suitable boundary conditions at infinity. We deal with this problem in a way\ndifferent from the hydrogen atom, since we consider space to be compact.\n8\nwhere p2 = \u2212m2 is the squared mass of the mode from the brane-world viewpoint, and\nZlmi(\u2126) are the spherical harmonics for the (n\u2212 1)-sphere3, with eigenvalue l(l + n\u2212 2).\nThe equation (3.1) is simplified by noting that\n\u221a\u2212g = A4B(Cr)n\u22121\u03c9n\u22121 = rn\u22121C2\u03c9n\u22121\n(where \u03c9n\u22121 is the measure on the unit (n\u2212 1)-sphere, which cancels), and C2\/B2 = f . The\nscalar field equation for (3.2) then reduces to\n\u2212 1\nrn\u22121C2\n(\nrn\u22121f\u03c6\u2032ml\n)\u2032\n+\nl(l + n\u2212 2)\nr2C2\n\u03c6ml =\nm2\nA2\n\u03c6ml . (3.3)\nIn order to study the qualitative features of (3.1) it is convenient to introduce the \u2018tortoise\u2019\ncoordinate\nr\u2217 =\n\u222b r\n0\ndr\nB\nA\n. (3.4)\nThe point r = 0 corresponds to r\u2217 = 0, and asymptotically r\u2217 \u223c r. We also change to a new\nfunction \u03c8ml(r) (see [20]),\n\u03c8ml(r) = W (r)\u03c6ml(r), W (r) \u2261 (rC)n\u221212 A3\/2 . (3.5)\nDoing so, we find a Schro\u00a8dinger type of equation for \u03c8ml,(\n\u2212 d\n2\ndr2\u2217\n+\n1\nW\nd2W\ndr2\u2217\n+\nA2\nr2C2\nl(l + n\u2212 2)\n)\n\u03c8ml(r) = m\n2\u03c8ml(r) . (3.6)\nThe \u201ceffective potential\u201d V for the field \u03c8 is 1\nW\nd2W\ndr2\n\u2217\n, which goes to \u2212\u221e at r\u2217 = 0, then\nreaches a maximum, and asymptotes to a constant value as r\u2217 \u2192 \u221e (see figure (1)). Near\nr\u2217 = 0 the potential diverges, while A\n2\nC2\ngoes to zero. Hence, all modes will behave near the\nsingularity like the s-wave component of the massless zero mode, m = l = 0. Notice that\nthis is unusual for partial waves with l > 0, and is in contrast to motion in flat space, or\nin the Coulomb potential where, for l > 0, centrifugal barriers dominate at short distances.\nHere, however, the size of the transverse spheres, rC, grows large as r \u2192 0, so the \u201cangular\nvelocity\u201d \u223c J\/(rC) is small there.\nTherefore, in order to investigate the effects of the singularity we need only to examine\nthe s-wave of the zero mode, \u03c600. It is easy to solve for it as\n\u03c800(r\u2217) = aW (r\u2217) + bW (r\u2217) log f, (3.7)\nthis is,\n\u03c600(r) = a+ b log f, (3.8)\nwith integration constants a, b. Now the question is what boundary conditions we must\nimpose at r\u2217 = 0 in order to have a well defined boundary value problem. Elementary\n3Recall that, even if in higher dimensions there can be more than one independent angular momenta, in\na spherically symmetric background they are degenerate and the wave equation depends only on a single\nnumber l.\n9\n\u20132\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nV\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nr\nFigure 1: Plot of the potential V = V (r) for n = 3 (solid line) and n = 4 with r0 = 0.5\nconsiderations for Sturm-Liouville problems dictate that the conditions are that \u03c600(0) and\n\u03c6\u203200(0) be bounded. Hence we set b = 0, which implies that the s-wave of the zero-mode is a\nconstant. The existence of this solution was clear from the very beginning, but what is less\ntrivial is that all other modes will behave similarly near r = 0.\nTo normalize this s-wave zero mode we use the standard Sturm-Liouville measure in the\nnormalization integral, with the weight function w(r) = \u03c9n\u22121rn\u22121C2\/A2 (=\n\u221a\u2212g\/A2) giving\nthe value of a as\na\u22122 = \u2126n\u22121\n\u222b\ndr rn\u22121\nC2\nA2\n. (3.9)\nThis is convergent at its lower limit r = 0, hence we can get a finite amplitude even without\nthe need to introduce a cutoff near r = 0. On the other hand, the upper bound r \u2264 Rc\nis needed in order to render the amplitude a non-zero. This is not unexpected, since we\nanticipated the need to compactify the extra dimensions. To leading order in r0\/Rc we have\na\u22122 \u2243 \u2126n\u22121R\nn\nc\nn\n\u2261 V0, (3.10)\nwhere, to this order, V0 is the volume of the extra directions. Note that the actual volume is\ndifferent, V = \u2126n\u22121\n\u222b\ndr rn\u22121C2\/A4. However, both the amplitude of the zero mode on the\nbrane, a, and V are finite even including the singularity at r = 0, and to leading order for\nlarge Rc, a\n\u22122 \u2243 V \u2243 V0.\n10\nm=1\nm=2\nm=3\nFigure 2: Plot of massive mode wavefunctions for n = 3, r0 = 1.\nThe same boundary conditions can, and must, be imposed for all other modes. For the\nmassless zero mode, the solution for the higher partial waves l > 0, and n > 2, can be\nfound explicitly as Legendre functions, \u03c60l \u221d P l\nn\u22122\n(x) with x = 2r\nn\u22122\nrn\u22122\n0\n+ 1 (for n = 3 we get\nLegendre polynomials Pl). These modes take on non-zero values at r = 0, but they grow\nas rl at large r, as in the absence of brane self-gravity. They will be eliminated once the\nboundary conditions for compactification are imposed.\nMassive modes also tend to a finite value at r = 0. At larger values of r their radial wave-\nfunctions asymptote to their flat space form in terms of Bessel functions, \u223c r1\u2212n\/2Jn+2l\u22122\n2\n(mr).\nAgain, only the s-wave component is expected to remain after compactification. The shape\nof some of these modes is exhibited in figure (2).\nWith these results in hand, we are ready to study the interactions mediated by scalars,\non either brane or bulk. The (Euclidean) scalar two-point Green\u2019s function between points\nwith brane and bulk coordinates (x\u00b5, r) and (x\u00b5\u2032, r\u2032), respectively, can be computed from the\n(normalized) eigenmodes \u03c6ml as\nG(x, x\u2032; r, r\u2032) =\n\u222b d4p\n(2\u03c0)4\neip\u00b5(x\n\u00b5\u2212x\u00b5\u2032)\n\u221e\u2211\nm=0\n\u2211\nl,mi\nZlmi(\u2126)Zlmi(\u2126\n\u2032)\n\u03c6ml(r)\u03c6ml(r\n\u2032)\np2 +m2\n. (3.11)\nCompactification will eliminate higher partial waves, and will also make the mass spectrum\n11\ndiscrete. Then, for two points on the brane at a large distance, the effective interaction\npotential will be predominantly mediated by the zero mode, and be given by\n\u03c600(0)\n2\n|x\u2212 x\u2032| \u2243\n1\nV0\n1\n|x\u2212 x\u2032| . (3.12)\nCorrections to the leading order value \u03c6200 \u2243 V \u221210 will appear at order (r0\/Rc)n\u22122. The\ndiscrete massive modes will, as usual, give finite corrections of Yukawa type.\nFinally, we can also study the stability of the perturbations. The argument is a standard\none. First, write (3.6) as\n(\nd\ndr\u2217\n+\nd logW\ndr\u2217\n)(\n\u2212 d\ndr\u2217\n+\nd logW\ndr\u2217\n)\n\u03c8ml(r) +\nA2\nr2C2\nl(l + n\u2212 2)\u03c8ml(r) = m2\u03c8ml(r) . (3.13)\nWith the boundary conditions specified above, the operators d\ndr\u2217\n+ d logW\ndr\u2217\nand \u2212 d\ndr\u2217\n+ d logW\ndr\u2217\nare each the adjoint of the other. Hence the operator that acts on \u03c8ml on the left hand side of\n(3.6) is a positive semidefinite self-adjoint operator. Its eigenmodes then provide a complete\nbasis, and their eigenvalues m2, are all non-negative. These perturbations are, then, stable.\nHence we have proven that even if the background metric exhibits a naked singularity at\nthe position of the brane, the propagation of minimal scalars, and the interactions mediated\nby them, on either brane or bulk, are well defined. The inclusion of a small but finite brane\nthickness cutoff rb can then be treated as a small perturbation.\nIn this sense, we have shown that the solutions (2.1), (2.2) are the genuine cousins of the\nconical string, and distributional wall, spacetimes \u2013 in that the nominal singularity of the\nmetric is quite integrable as far as causal propagation of fields on the spacetime is concerned.\n4 Gravity on the brane\nThe leading static scalar potential (3.12) appears to be finite and largely independent of the\ncutoff imposed by the thickness of the brane4. However, notice that, in (3.12), the distance\n|x\u2212x\u2032| is a coordinate distance, whereas the proper distance would be A(rb)|x\u2212x\u2032|. This gets\nsmaller as rb decreases. Assuming, as we said, that on the brane the functions A,B,C do\nnot vary appreciably from their value at r = rb, then the proper distance between two points\non the brane will be \u2113 = A(rb)|x\u2212 x\u2032|, and the leading order static interaction potential\nV (x, x\u2032) =\ng4+nA(rb)\nV0\n1\n\u2113\n, (4.1)\n4Our views and interpretation in this section have been greatly improved by comments from Valery\nRubakov.\n12\nwhere g4+n is the scalar coupling in 4 + n dimensions. Hence it appears that the effective\ncoupling on the brane, g4, takes the form\ng4 =\ng4+nA(rb)\nV0\n. (4.2)\nThis is different from the standard result in the absence of brane self-gravity, which would\nnot have the factor A(rb). As rb gets smaller, the coupling on the brane gets weaker, and\nvanishes for a brane of zero thickness. Therefore, self-gravity makes the effective coupling\ninduced on the brane acquire a strong dependence on the brane thickness.\nIndeed, this feature would have been expected not only for scalars, but also for the gravity\nthat is induced on the brane. Typically, in a brane world model, gravity becomes weaker\nwhere the brane metric is smaller, in the sense that the conformal factor A2 in front of the\nmetric becomes smaller5. In the present case, the proper size of the brane is proportional to\nA(rb), which decreases as rb gets smaller.\nLet us see in more detail how this comes about. To study the propagation of gravitons\nin the background of these branes, we perturb the metric gab = g\n0\nab + hab, where g\n0 is the\nbackground metric of (2.2), and we choose a gauge where perturbations are transverse and\ntrace-free (TTF). The perturbations with indices along the brane metric, h\u00b5\u03bd , will be related\nto tensor gravity on the brane. The brane scalars hrr, h\u03b8\u03b8, hr\u03b8 give rise to massless scalars,\nwhich, upon compactification, correspond to the moduli for deformations of the internal\nspace. These are a source of phenomenological difficulties, common to any compactification\nscheme. In the following, (in keeping with much of the literature) we shall assume that there\nexists a mechanism that gives a large mass to the moduli and stabilizes them up to some\nhigh energy scale. If this is the case, they will decouple at low energies, so these components\nof hab can be set to zero. We will come back to this point in the final section.\nWith these assumptions, it is enough to perturb A2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd \u2192 A2\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd + h\u00b5\u03bd (in TTF gauge,\n\u2207\u00b5h\u00b5\u03bd = h\u00b5\u00b5 = 0). Let us factor out the conformal factor and define h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd = A\u22122(r)h\u00b5\u03bd . The\nresulting Lichnerowicz equation is\n[\n2xh\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd + 2R0\u00b5\u03bb\u03bd\u03c3h\u02c6\n\u03bb\u03c3\n]\n\u2212 A\n2\n\u221a\u2212g\n[\u221a\u2212g\nB2\nh\u02c6\u2032\u00b5\u03bd\n]\u2032\n= 0 , (4.3)\nwhere primes denote r-derivatives. The polarization structure can also be factored out,\nh\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x, z) = \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u03a6(x, z), with \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd a constant polarization tensor. Doing this, the equation\nthat results for \u03a6 is precisely the same as for a minimally coupled scalar, which we have\nstudied in the previous section. Hence we find that, in a compact space, the interactions\nare dominated by the s-wave of the zero mode of the graviton. In order to determine the\ngravitational coupling on the brane it is then enough to focus on the latter mode.\n5This is also familiar from string theory, where the supergravity solutions for fundamental strings or\nD-branes show that they can be coupled perturbatively (weakly) to gravity, i.e., to closed strings.\n13\nIn fact, the easiest way to do so is by working with the s-wave of the zero mode of the\ngraviton exactly, i.e., beyond the linearized approximation. This is easy, since that mode is\nconstant. Non-perturbatively, this is to say that the metric (2.2) continues to be a solution\n(with the same functions A,B,C, and f), when instead of the Minkowski metric we place\nan arbitrary Ricci-flat metric \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x),\nds2 = A2(r)\u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x)dx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd +B2(r)dr2 + C2(r)r2d\u21262n\u22121 . (4.4)\nThis \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x) is the non-perturbative counterpart of the s-wave of the zero mode of the\nperturbation h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd . Actually, the metric induced on the brane is not \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x), but instead\n\u03b3\u00b5\u03bd(x) = A\n2(rb)\u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x), hence we write\nds2 =\nA2(r)\nA2(rb)\n\u03b3\u00b5\u03bd(x)dx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd +B2(r)dr2 + C2(r)r2d\u21262n\u22121 . (4.5)\nThe (\u00b5, \u03bd) components of the Ricci tensor in the bulk R\u00b5\u03bd , are equal to those of the Ricci\ntensor in the brane, R\u00b5\u03bd(\u03b3), so\nR =\nA2(rb)\nA2(r)\nR . (4.6)\nThe relationship between the Newton constant in the bulk and in the brane follows easily\nnow by integrating the extra dimensions in the Einstein-Hilbert action,\n1\nG4+n\n\u222b\ndr d\u2126n\u22121 d4x\n\u221a\u2212gR = 1\nG4\n\u222b\nd4x\n\u221a\u2212\u03b3R+ . . . , (4.7)\nusing (4.6),\nG4+n\nG4\n=\n\u222b\nd\u2126n\u22121dr\nA2(rb)\n\u221a\u2212g\nA2(r)\n\u221a\u2212\u03b3 =\n1\nA(rb)2\n\u222b\nd\u2126n\u22121dr rn\u22121\nC2\nA2\n\u2243 V0\nA2(rb)\n, (4.8)\nwhere, up to the constant A2(rb), the integral is the same as appeared in eqs. (3.9) and (3.10),\nand is evaluated under the same approximations. For rb \u226a r0 and using the expression for\nA in (2.2), we obtain the result we announced in the introduction (1.1),\nG4 \u2243 G4+n\nV0\n(\nrb\nr0\n)n\u22122\n2\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn+2\n. (4.9)\nThis is our main result. It implies that the dimensionless ratio rb\/r0 can be used for, or\ncontribute to, generating a hierarchy between the fundamental scale of G4+n and the Planck\nscale on the brane of G4. There are several possibilities. One is that the whole hierarchy is\ngenerated by this ratio, with Rc(\u223c V 1\/n0 ) being at the fundamental scale. In this case, the\n14\nhierarchy problem consists of explaining why the brane thickness and tension have such an\nunnaturally small ratio6. Another possibility is that the hierarchy is partly generated by the\nvolume factor, and partly by the brane parameters ratio. Since the curvature near the brane\nis controlled by rb, the latter might be at the fundamental scale, while r0 might be somewhat\ndifferent. The interesting feature of this result is that the hierarchy can be changed without\nsignificantly varying the mass of the Kaluza-Klein states, which is determined by 1\/Rc.\nFinally, it might perhaps be argued that the factor (rb\/r0)\nn\u22122\n2\n\u221a\nn\u22121\nn+2 could be absorbed\nby a redefinition of the internal volume. However, we have seen that the actual internal\nvolume is finite even for rb = 0, and moreover, that would not be a useful viewpoint, since\nthe mass of the Kaluza-Klein states is set by V\n\u22121\/n\n0 . The extra factor comes essentially from\nthe curvature scalar R. Again, this is similar to the situation in the RS1 model.\n5 Black branes and black holes on the brane\nBy exciting only the s-wave of the zero mode one can construct black n-branes. If the effect\nof compactification is neglected, they correspond to\nds2 = A2(r)\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\u2212\n(\n1\u2212 2m\n\u03c1\n)\ndt2 +\nd\u03c12\n1\u2212 2m\n\u03c1\n+ \u03c12d\u212622\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb+B2(r)dr2 + C2(r)r2d\u21262n\u22121 (5.1)\n(taking, again, (2.2) for A,B,C)7. The size of the horizon in the directions transverse to\nthe brane grows as r = 0 is approached, while in the parallel directions it shrinks. The two\neffects considered, the overall size grows, but the entropy remains finite: the area of the\nhorizon of the black brane is\nA = \u2126n\u22121\n\u222b\ndr rn\u22121A3Cn\u22121 = \u2126n\u22121\n\u222b\ndr rn\u22121\nC2\nAB\n, (5.2)\nand it is easy to see that even if the integrand diverges at r = 0, the divergence can be\nintegrated. Hence, the entropy of these black branes is finite (if in a compact space) and it\ngets somewhat higher near the brane-world than it would be if the bulk were not curved by\nthe brane-world.\nThis solution, like its counterparts in the absence of the 3-brane [21], or in anti-de Sitter\nspace [22] is in fact unstable if the size of the horizon, 2m, gets smaller than the compact-\nification length. Recall that in [21], it was shown that a black string (metric (5.1) with\n6I.e., small rb\/r0, but we remind the reader that in a certain sense small rb implies a thick brane\n7As a side remark, note that this solution describes a localized intersection of branes, i.e., the three-brane\n(the brane-world) is intersected by the black n-brane that extends in the directions transverse to the former.\nIt is expected by no-hair arguments that such intersections are singular, as is so in this case.\n15\nA = B = C = 1) is unstable to fragmentation in the extra rn dimensions. The instability\ntakes the form of a 4D massive tensorial TTF s-wave perturbation:\nhab = e\ni\u00b5\u00b7r\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\nh\u02dctt h\u02dct\u03c1 0 0\nh\u02dct\u03c1 h\u02dc\u03c1\u03c1 0 0\n0 0 h\u02dc\u03b8\u03b8 0\n0 0 0 h\u02dc\u03b8\u03b8 sin\n2 \u03b8\n0\n0 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n. (5.3)\nThe effect of this instability (due to the ei\u00b5\u00b7r) is to induce a rippling in the event horizon\n\u2013 which by entropic arguments we expect to fragment. The key feature of this instability\n(demonstrated and exploited in [22]) is that it lies purely within the 4D \u00b5\u2212 \u03bd coordinates,\nand the action of the full Lichnerowicz operator produces a 4D Lichnerowicz operator with\na mass term arising from the prefactor depending on the orthogonal directions\n\u2206n+4hab \u221d\n(\n\u22064 +M\n2\n)\nh\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd . (5.4)\nIn the case of flat extra dimensions, this observation is trivial, however, if the extra dimen-\nsions are curved, as in (5.1) (or as in the RS scenario [22]) this splitting in fact still occurs.\nTherefore, the general instability will have the form f\nM\n(x\u22a5)h\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd , where h\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd is the massive\ntensorial instability of (5.4) and f\nM\n(x\u22a5), is the appropriate orthogonal eigenfunction giving\nrise to that mass. So, for the standard p-brane instability of [21], where the transverse di-\nmensions are flat, the eigenfunction is ei\u00b5ix\ni\n; for anti-de Sitter space, it is the appropriate\nRandall-Sundrum orthogonal eigenfunction um(z) [4, 22]. In our case, we have demonstrated\nthe eigenfunctions \u03c6ml in section 3, and therefore the appropriate form of the instability is\nh\u00b5\u03bd \u223c A2(r)Zlmi(\u2126)\u03c6ml(r)h\u02dc\u00b5\u03bd . (5.5)\nThe horizon therefore develops a instability, rippling with a shape given by the waveforms\nin figure 2.\nThe black brane in a large enough compact space is expected to collapse into a black hole.\nHow to get an exact description of the black hole on the brane remains an open problem for\nn \u2265 3, even when brane self-gravity is neglected8. In the latter approximation, and if the\nfinite compactification size effects can be neglected, then the black hole is well approximated\nby the 4 + n dimensional Schwarzschild solution, at least for distances on the brane that\nare smaller than the compactification length. In coordinates adapted to the presence of the\nbrane, this is\nds2 = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bddx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd+dr2+r2d\u21262n\u22121+\n2m\n(r2 + xixi)(n\u22122)\/2\ndt2\u2212 2m\n(r2 + xixi)n\/2\n(rdr+xidxi)2 (5.6)\n8Toy models for lower dimensional branes are more tractable, see e.g., [23].\n16\n(i = 1, 2, 3). The brane corresponds to the section r = 0.\nBrane self-gravity will significantly distort this geometry near the core of the brane. In\nparticular, we have seen that the size of the spheres Sn\u22121 grows larger near the brane, and\nthe directions parallel to the brane to shrink. Hence, we can expect that the black hole will\npinch at the brane core in directions parallel to the brane, but will greatly expand in the\ndirections transverse to it. As was the case for the black brane, these two competing effects\nare expected to balance in the calculation of the area of the horizon in the bulk, which is\nexpected to remain finite. In general, as argued in [24], black holes remain attached to the\nbrane. In the present case this may be even more so, since the area of the horizons gets\ncomparatively higher near the brane.\n6 Discussion\nLet us now discuss, mostly from a qualitative point of view, an issue we have left aside so\nfar, namely the compactification moduli. Even before dealing with their stabilization, we\nshould expect the moduli amplitudes to be very large at the position of the brane. It was\nalready observed in [25] that in the RS1 model, the corresponding modulus (the radion) gets\nlarge there where gravitons parallel to the brane get small, and vice versa. This is, in fact,\na consequence of Einstein\u2019s equations in vacuo. In our case, it would be in accord with the\nfact that the metric in the directions transverse to the brane grows without bound as rb gets\nsmaller, while it goes to zero in the parallel directions.\nNow suppose that we compactify the extra dimensions and somehow manage to stabilize\nthe moduli and give them a large mass. The infinite (for rb = 0) amplitude of the moduli at\nthe brane would seem to imply that the brane is extremely sensitive to (scalar) deformations\nof the compact manifold. In order to avoid this, the compact manifold has to be very rigid,\ni.e., the mass of the moduli has to be very large. With finite brane thickness, the minimum\nmass of the moduli can be expected to be determined by, roughly, 1\/rb. Since the equations\nfor parallel gravitons and moduli do not decouple, any fluctuations in the moduli will have\nan effect on the parallel gravitons. Therefore, the question of moduli stabilization is actually\nof relevance to the entire setup. Nevertheless, we have seen that if it can be appropriately\nsolved, then all other issues about the consequences of brane self-gravity and the influence\nof the brane thickness can be safely dealt with.\nAlthough we have been considering the specific case of what is arguably the simplest\nthree-brane solution, the weakening of gravity on the brane is actually rather generic. Recall\nthat the warp that gives rise to the factor rb\/r0 in (1.1) is due to the shrinkage of the metric\nalong the directions parallel to the brane, while the brane core remains at a finite proper\nspatial distance. This shrinkage is, in fact, a generic consequence of the tension along the\n17\nbrane directions. Hence, once one has a brane with a certain positive tension, the same\nshrinkage will happen even in the presence of extra bulk fields, for as long as the gravity of\nthe latter is not so strong as to upset the effect. In fact, the non-generic cases will be those\nfor which the extra bulk fields act in such a way as to exactly counterbalance the shrinkage\nof the geometry \u2013 such is the case of e.g., D3-branes, for which the gravity of the RR field\nhas the effect of pushing the brane core down an infinite throat.\nTo conclude, we have shown how to incorporate the gravitational field induced by a brane\nwith three or more transverse dimensions, and have found that it can lead to important\neffects. Although the solutions (2.1), (2.2) exhibit singularities at the core of the brane, the\nsingularities are such that bulk fields can propagate in their presence in a finite and unitary\nway. Hence, we can legitimately regard these solutions as the higher dimensional analogues\nof the domain wall and cosmic string spacetimes. Concerning the gravity that is induced on\nthe brane, a new dimensionless parameter, which is determined by the brane structure, enters\ninto the determination of the effective four dimensional gravitational constant. This can be\nused to generate, or contribute to, a hierarchy between the Planck scale and a fundamental\nscale. Nevertheless, the energy scale for Kaluza-Klein excitations remains largely unaffected\nby variations of that parameter. Such an influence of brane parameters on the hierarchy is\na novel effect, to be added to ADD scenarios. It mixes in the main ingredient present in the\nRS1 model, namely, the warping created by the brane self-gravity, and hence provides the\npossibility of taking advantage of some of the features of each model.\nOf course, if one wishes instead to deal with a genuinely fat brane-world, one must first\nfind a reasonable core model. Ghergetta et. al. [11] point out some problems with a fully\nlocalised core, and it is quite possible that none such exists. If one wishes to model the brane\nby a topological defect (as in [10]) then one generally has a spontaneously broken symmetry\nin the vacuum of the theory. For a defect of codimension n, this mandates a nontrivial \u03a0n\u22121\nhomotopy group of the vacuum manifold (or coset space G\/H). For simple Lie groups, this\nis equivalent to \u03a0n\u22122(H), the unbroken group, but if H is nontrivial, then there will be\nCoulomb fields surrounding the core of the defect [12] \u2013 in other words, we might expect any\nsmooth brane-world not to have a fully localised core. Another possibility is that the brane\nis not a field-theoretical defect, but a brane originating from string theory. It cannot be a\nD3-brane, but the latter is in fact a very special case due to conformal invariance. More\nrealistic stringy brane-worlds may well exhibit the kind of warping we have described.\nIndeed, string theory suggests a way in which a small ratio between brane thickness and\nbrane tension can arise. Suppose that string theory, or whatever the fundamental theory is,\nhas branes of the form we require (or similar, in that they present the appropriate shrinkage\nin brane directions while keeping the brane core at a finite proper distance). For a single\nbrane in that theory the tension and thickness scales would both be at the fundamental scale,\n18\nsay the string scale ls. Now, if instead of one brane we have a stack of N branes, then the\nthickness would presumably still be rb \u223c ls, but since we have N branes the tension would\nhave grown. In the absence of interactions between the branes one would have, if eq. (2.4)\nholds, r0 \u223c N1\/(n\u22122)ls. Interactions betwen the branes, if attractive, will reduce this value,\nbut at any rate the tension will grow as N grows. Therefore r0\/rb grows with N , and a large\nhierarchy appears for large N . A number of issues has to be dealt with, since having a stack\nwith a large number of branes increases accordingly the number of brane fields, including\nthe light ones. A way to prevent them from interfering with the fields we actually observe\nwould have to be provided. The question of whether this is a workable direction remains an\nopen one.\nFor now, we cannot fully answer all these questions in detail, but we simply note that\nwe have shown that the brane-world gravity can be dramatically dependent on the specific\nmodel used to generate the core.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Vakif Onemli, Pierre Ramond, Valery Rubakov, Tigran Tchrakian\nand Richard Woodard for helpful discussions.\nCC is supported by US DoE grant DE-FG02-97ER41209, RE is partially supported by\nUPV grant 063.310-EB187\/98 and CICYT AEN99-0315, and RG is by the Royal Society.\nWe would also like to acknowledge the support of a Royal Society ESEP exchange grant.\nA How to obtain a \u201cPlanck brane\u201d\nIf the effect of brane self-gravity is used to generate the entire hierarchy between the TeV\nand Planck scales, then, in the terminology of [3] the brane would be a \u201cTeV-brane.\u201d In\ncontrast to [3], there is no \u201cPlanck-brane\u201d in this model. A \u201cprobe\u201d Planck brane would\nhave to sit at a location where the metric factor A(r) takes on values of order unity.\nNevertheless, there is a way to make the self-gravitating brane of (2.2) a Planck brane.\nIndeed, it allows to find finite gravity on the brane even in the limit rb \u2192 0, as occurs for\nthe domain wall or cosmic string brane-worlds. In that case, the limit where the brane has\nzero size is sensible on its own, and the physics at low energies is actually independent of\nany details of the brane structure. This might be a desirable feature.\nThe procedure to achieve this lies on an alternative, if somewhat ad hoc definition of\nwhat the brane metric is, i.e., to which metric does matter on the brane couple to. Usually,\nfields that live on the brane are just a truncation of fields that actually can extend into the\nbulk, but whose propagation into the bulk is heavily suppressed, by say, the topology of\n19\nthe field configuration. This is, they are actually bulk fields, and hence they will couple to\ngravity through the metric induced on the brane. Now, let us suppose instead that the fields\nthat live on the brane do not couple to the metric induced on the brane (which has zero size\nif rb = 0), but rather to one that is related by a constant rescaling. This implies rescaling\nthe strength of the gravitational interactions on the brane, which can be done in such a way\nthat a finite brane metric results, and finite gravity on it, even if rb \u2192 0. More specifically,\nin the spacetime (4.4)\nds2 = A2(r)\u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x, r,\u2126)dx\n\u00b5dx\u03bd +B2(r)dr2 + C2(r)r2d\u21262n\u22121 , (A.1)\nlet us define our brane metric to be \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x) \u2261 \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x, r = 0). By this we mean that matter\nfields on the brane will couple to gravity through the metric \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd . For example, we take the\naction for a brane-scalar \u03d5 as\n1\n2\n\u222b\nd4x\n\u221a\n\u2212\u03b3\u02c6(\u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u00b5\u03d5\u2202\u03bd\u03d5+ \u00b52\u03d52) . (A.2)\nEquivalently, in the linearized approximation where \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd = \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd + h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd , the coupling to a brane\nsource of stress-energy T\u00b5\u03bd will be through a term\n1\n2\n\u222b\nd4xT\u00b5\u03bd h\u02c6\n\u00b5\u03bd . (A.3)\nThis is different to coupling to the actual metric perturbation h\u00b5\u03bd = A\n2(r)h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd . In fact, a\ncoupling of the form (A.3) does not arise naturally in any of the common ways to generate\nbrane fields from a topological defect. However, one may argue that the question of how\nto generate such couplings belongs in the realm of the higher theory that gives rise to the\nbrane, and which we have explicitly left out of our discussion.\nIt is now a straightforward matter to show, following the steps that lead to (1.1), that to\nleading order in r0\/Rc, the Newton constant on the brane is given by the standard formula,\nG4 \u2243 G4+n\nV0\n, (A.4)\ninstead of (1.1). Notice that even if h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd satisfies the same equation as the scalar \u03a6 of the\nprevious section, the argument that the distance |x \u2212 x\u2032| that appeared in the interaction\npotential (3.12) is not the proper distance is not relevant anymore. For, if brane matter\ncouples to the metric \u03b3\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd , then |x\u2212x\u2032| is the distance actually measured by a brane observer\n(with rulers made of brane matter), and the interaction potential is indeed of the form (3.12),\nwithout any extra factors.\nWe can now analyze the different gravitational interactions between brane and bulk\nmatter. We have seen that h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd satisfies the same equation as the minimal scalar \u03a6 of the\n20\nprevious section. Hence, for two sources on the brane, which couple to gravity through the\ninteraction term (A.3), the relevant two-point function is\n\u3008h\u02c6\u00b5\u03bd(x)h\u02c6\u03c1\u03c3(x\u2032)\u3009 = \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u01eb\u2032\u03c1\u03c3G(x, x\u2032; 0, 0) , (A.5)\nwhere G(x, x\u2032; 0, 0) is that of (3.11) with the two points at r = 0. This is finite, and all the\ncomments made about the scalar interaction on the brane through (3.11), apply here as well.\nNow, if one of the sources is on the brane and the other is in the bulk, with the stress-\nenergy tensor of the latter lying along the brane directions, and coupling as \u223c \u222b T\u00b5\u03bdh\u00b5\u03bd \u223c\u222b\nA2(r)T\u00b5\u03bd h\u02c6\n\u00b5\u03bd , then\n\u3008h\u00b5\u03bd(x, z)h\u02c6\u03c1\u03c3(x\u2032, 0)\u3009 = \u01eb\u00b5\u03bd\u01eb\u2032\u03c1\u03c3A2(r)G(x, x\u2032; z, 0) . (A.6)\nAgain, this is finite, although it becomes smaller as the bulk source gets closer to the brane.\nThis serves us to illustrate one of the important features of this prescription for obtaining\na Planck brane, namely, that brane matter and bulk matter are, with this prescription,\nfundamentally different. The gravitational interactions of matter in the bulk (at least those\nmediated by gravitons with polarization parallel to the brane) become weaker closer to the\nbrane. At r = 0, its coupling to gravity vanishes. In contrast, brane matter gravitates\nfinitely, but if one tried to pull it out of the brane its weight would presumably become\ninfinite. Hence such brane matter would have to be permanently confined to the brane.\nBizarre as this may sound, the prescription appears to be a consistent one, for which the\nissue of the correct coupling of gravity can only be resolved from the point of view of the\ntheory that underlies the brane structure. The most striking consequence of this is that\nfinite results can be obtained even if the proper size of the brane has shrunk to zero!\nReferences\n[1] V. A. Rubakov and M. E. Shaposhnikov, Phys.
