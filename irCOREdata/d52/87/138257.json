They also need to be quality-conscious, customer-oriented and\nconstantly improving their performance. They need to think about work and working in a\ndifferent way, to work \u201coutside the box\u201d, which calls for high levels of cognitive skill\n(Buckley & Kemp 1989: 158). Because they now operate in a dynamic and highly\ncompetitive global marketplace, organisations worldwide are waking-up to the calling of\nexecutive development.\nWith the implications of not undertaking executive development becoming more acute,\nthe nature and purpose of executive development activities have changed considerably\nover recent years. There has been a shift away from business school-based development\ntowards in-company programmes, albeit with external expert input. Equally there is a\ngrowing move towards e-learning and distance learning as more people embrace modern\ntechnologies. Similarly, rather than executive development being solely for the purpose\nof career development and succession planning for a small group of senior managers, it\nhas become more of a tool for achieving competitive advantage for the organisation.\nThe study presented here, commissioned by the Careers Research Forum (see Appendix),\nattempts to clarify some of the terms commonly used in executive development, and to\ndiscuss the issues arising from a review of the literature and from case study interviews.\n4It will be found that executive development reflects many disparate views. However,\nalthough no definitive work exists on the nature and growth of executive development,\ndefinition has emerged from this study.\nAs a starting point we analyse the terminology of seniority, since the structure of senior\nmanagement teams and boards can vary enormously. To understand the often\ninterchangeable terms \u201cboard\u201d, \u201ctop team\u201d, \u201cexecutive committee\u201d and \u201cmanagement\ncommittee\u201d, we examine the nature of these entities.\nWe argue that organisational success depends on the top team and board members\npossessing an appropriate balance of skills, competencies and capabilities. Because these\nterms are often used interchangeably, both in the literature and in organisations, we\nhighlight the difference between them. In particular we regard capability as a measure of\nsenior manager performance, as it is senior management that is required to harness the\nskills and competencies of the organisation in a way that affects its performance.\nConsiderable attention is paid in this article to leadership capability as an important\ncomponent of executive development. Despite this, we show that no single style of\nleadership fits every situation. We therefore analyse a variety of approaches to leadership,\nincluding transformational and transactional, and we examine the related challenges that\nleaders face. We also explore the newly popular concept of servant leadership, which\nespouses the higher order values of honesty and integrity as opposed to leadership\nmotivated by self-interest.\n5The emerging popularity of values such as honesty and integrity has been fuelled by\nrecent revelations of unethical practices on the part of certain organisations. Attention is\nthus increasingly being paid to corporate governance and corporate social responsibility\nissues, whose impact on executive development is often overlooked. In this work we\nexamine two contrasting models of corporate governance - the Anglo-American model\nand the continental European\/Japanese model - and look at the chief differences between\nthem and their effect on the performance and development of directors.\nConcepts such as \u201ctraining\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d are also clarified here, and\nwe show the linkages to business strategy. We suggest that, however executive\ndevelopment is undertaken, it should be carried out within a strategic framework rather\nthan as a separate and isolated process so as to deliver business benefits.\nThe study explores both individual and collective approaches to executive development.\nExecutive development is believed to lead to superior individual and organisational\nperformance and increased competitiveness for the organisation, as well as helping\ndirectors to become more professional in the performance of their duties and their\ncompliance with legal requirements. However, perceived barriers to executive\ndevelopment are also identified. The most commonly stated reason for not undertaking\ndevelopment is lack of time, the next most common that development is not applicable at\nsenior level because individuals have already developed themselves sufficiently.\n6Following the discussion of the range of issues affecting executive development, we\npresent six case studies of organisations pursuing executive development initiatives.\nThese case studies are based on interviews with senior managers in the organisations\nconcerned. Each study is evaluated to explore how executive development is being used\nto meet organisational priorities. We also provide an additional case study based on\ninterviews with four different external analysts designed to show how top teams and\nboards are evaluated by people outside the organisation.\nThe work concludes with a model of executive development designed to enable\norganisations to explore their own array of skills, competencies and capabilities at top\nteam and board level. The model illustrates that, to be effective in a specific context,\nsenior managers require a particular balance of skills, competencies and capabilities.\nFinally, we set out the key learning points emerging from both the literature and the case\nstudies, concluding with a summary of the study\u2019s findings relating to nine core research\nquestions.\n7Research Methodology\nThis research set out to achieve three goals:\n- to discover the extent to which members of boards and top teams of large\norganisations (private and public sector) undertake continuing personal development\non both an individual and collective basis;\n- to determine what form this development takes and how effective it is;\n- to analyse what helps, and what hinders, executive development at this level.\nA detailed review of current thinking on executive development, as reflected in the\nliterature, was the starting point for the research, and forms the framework for this study.\nThe field research was conducted primarily by face-to-face interviews with twenty-one\ndirectors from nine organisations in May and June 2002. Excerpts from these interviews\nare quoted throughout this work. Case studies demonstrating different approaches to\nexecutive development are also included. A grid comparing the attention paid to\nexecutive development across the case studies indicates the degree of involvement and\nactivity exhibited by the companies.\nThe questions put to the case organisations explored top team and board members\u2019 roles,\nresponsibilities, skills, competencies and capabilities, the extent to which personal and\ncollective development and career planning take place at senior management level, the\nobstacles that exist to this, the methods used to identify development needs, the means of\n8delivering development, how development is evaluated, and the impact of specific\norganisational circumstances and personalities on development activity.\nPertinent to these themes, our questions to Directors of Human Resources focused on the\nextent to which they use corporate language when talking about development, and how\nthey make directors aware of development issues. Questions to Chief Executive Officers\n(CEOs) and other functional directors dealt with development as a tool for adding value\nto the organisation and differentiating it in the marketplace.\nInterviews were also held with four external specialists (a financial correspondent, a non-\nexecutive director, an executive search consultant and a talent management consultant).\nOur questions to external analysts focused on the criteria they use to assess the\ncapabilities of top management and hence form a view as to the effectiveness of the\norganisation.\nDespite the range of interviewees, the organisations included in this work cannot\nnecessarily be seen as representative of similar organisations. The context in which an\norganisation operates and its own characteristics are key determinants of executive\ndevelopment orientation.\n91. The Past, Present and Future of Executive Development\nIn this section we examine how the methods of executive development have changed\nover time, even though the reasons for, and problems confronting, their application have\nremained largely the same. We argue that the prominence executive development\ncurrently enjoys is due to the speed at which the organisational environment is changing.\nDynamic market conditions and advances in technology are set to affect the way\ndevelopment is tackled in the future, with a special emphasis on distance delivery as a\nmeans to accommodate the time constraints facing busy executives. We also explore the\nrole of external providers of executive development in light of the increasing requirement\nto customise activities to meet the specific needs of each organisation.\n1.1 The past\nExecutive development began almost a century ago, with a range of approaches that\nvaried from university degrees such as the MBA, through non-degree executive\ndevelopment courses or open programmes of differing lengths, to tailored, in-company\nequivalents. These are all still much in evidence today. Certain companies, such as\nGeneral Electric, also used their own educational centres to train their managers, and\nalthough their programmes reflected what universities offered, they were determined\nmore by the interests of the company. Similarly today, there are organisations that have\ntheir own universities and\/or partnerships with universities, such as that between British\nAerospace and Cranfield University in the UK.\n10\nThe idea behind executive development was, and still is, to provide advanced\nmanagement training and education to mature, motivated and experienced managers. The\nmain focus of both university open programmes and in-house programmes was, and still\nis, on the individual development of executives in order to improve their performance and\nprepare them for future positions. Over the years the preponderance of undergraduate\nmanagement programmes has increased, with large numbers of universities offering\nbusiness studies degrees, resulting in more managers having followed management\neducation programmes by the time they reach senior management levels.\nWhatever approach is adopted, there have always been problems with executive\ndevelopment that are still in evidence today: transferring knowledge back to the job and\nthe difficulty of measuring the benefits of development, are two examples. Then, as now,\nreturnees would encounter resistance to their new ideas from colleagues who had not had\nthe benefit of following the course (Tichy, 1988: 9).\nIn the past, and indeed today, some organisations were never convinced of the relevance\nof formal executive education. Instead, they preferred their executives to gain experience\non-the-job through such methods as job rotation and project assignments, which they\nbelieved equipped them with enough knowledge of vital operations to prepare them for\nsenior-level positions. More formal training was left to individual initiative as a form of\nself-development (Stuller, 1993: 37).\n11\n1.2 The present\nOver the last decade technological advances, mergers, acquisitions, downsizing and\nmaturing markets, have transformed the business world. As a consequence, executive\ndevelopment has had to become more relevant to the business needs of the organisation\n(Sargeant & Matheson, 1996: 3). Complex organisations have grown increasingly aware\nthat, to compete successfully, they must adopt a broader outlook, become more open to\nexternal opportunities, and maintain a culture of constant learning (Goodwin & Fulmer,\n1995: 9).\nCompanies are becoming more demanding customers, forcing executive education to\napply a variety of new approaches (Crotty & Soule, 1997: 8). However, external\nproviders of executive education, far from declining, have been flexible in responding to\nnew demands. Executive MBA programmes have grown in scope and number over the\npast decade and there has been a rise in joint ventures between organisations and\nuniversities to provide programmes tailored to specific company needs. For example,\nAshridge has run a consortium MBA for Lufthansa, Deutsche Bank and MCIWorldcom,\nCranfield School of Management is one partner that provides MBA education for the\nCivil Service, and there are numerous relationships such as Bell Atlantic\/Wharton, Ford\nMotor Company\/University of Michigan and Schering\/Cranfield School of Management.\n12\nThe use of customised programmes and of in-company programmes to launch\norganisational change has increased the emphasis on meeting the management education\nneeds specific to the enterprise. This trend is expected to continue.\nWhether university-based, in-house, or a combination of the two, executive development\ntoday tends to cover global issues such as culture, employment conditions, and the pursuit\nof opportunities in foreign markets. It provides specific knowledge of how organisations\ncan survive in a globally competitive world. Executive education stresses the importance\nof leadership, communication, the customer relationship and implementing organisational\nchange to create winning business strategies.\n1.3 The future\nIn the future technology and distance delivery are expected to play a more important role\nin executive education (Crotty & Soule, 1997: 15-19). Distance learning, though not a\nnew concept, continues to be useful in an age of individual development. Rapid changes\nin technical and managerial knowledge, the explosion of technology and the ability of\npeople to work from home, together with the new employer-employee relationships\ncreated by temporary contracts arising from downsizing and organisational redesign, have\nproduced a need for constant updating of people\u2019s skills and knowledge. However, it is\nequally becoming evident that time technology application orientation constraints limit\nthe uptake of distance learning and e-learning at the top. Discussions held at the Careers\nResearch Forum indicate that secretaries are still being used for e-mailing.\n13\nIn-house programmes will remain important but will need, increasingly, to be able to\ndraw on external expertise to help senior managers enhance their understanding of market\nand societal changes and to avail themselves of the insights of academia and those\npractitioners who have \u2018been there and done it\u2019.\nAmongst our interviewees, Priscilla Vacassin, Group HR Director at BAA, explains that,\nfor her, executive development is a question of \u201ctalking to people about what they may\nhave in terms of potential and actually the extent to which that does or does not convert\nitself into effective performance in a commercial organisation.\u201d Hence, customised\nprogrammes are an important part of executive development and are growing in number,\nalthough cost has been a serious disincentive in the past. For the future, the trend is\ntowards several companies jointly engaging in a customised programme through\nconsortia arrangements.\nThus executive education and development continue to thrive as companies adjust to a\nnew competitive climate (Vicere, 1998: 539). As the organisational environment and\ncorporate needs begin to change, companies will start to use executive education to\ntransform corporate cultures and to implement new strategies (Crotty & Soule, 1997: 20).\nIt is predicted that executive development will become an even more important way to\nimplement change in the organisations of the future and, with in-company programme\nparticipation levels running at approximately seven times higher than those for external\nprogrammes (Vicere, 1998: 539), in-company programmes are more likely to dominate\nthe corporate development agenda.\nDeleted: .\nDeleted: , in\n14\nAt the same time, companies will become more demanding consumers of executive\ndevelopment programmes because they are more cost-conscious and less passively\ncommitted to university executive education than were their predecessors (Vicere, 1998:\n539). \u201c[Development] needs to be in a framework where there's a benefit to the business.\nIf it's just because it's a nice thing to do, or the right thing to do, then it\u2019s not on the\nagenda\u201d (Neil Roden, Group Director of Human Resources at the Royal Bank of\nScotland). Eithne Wallis, National Director of the Probation Service for England and\nWales, is sure on this point: \u201cWe\u2019re very clear why we are doing this development. We\u2019re\nnot doing it because we\u2019re nice people or because we\u2019ve got a mission to develop the\nworld. We\u2019re doing it because the effectiveness and the performance of the National\nProbation Service is directly connected to the competence, the confidence and the buy-in\nof the top people.\u201d\n15\n2. Contrasting Perspectives to Development\nDifferent terminologies are used to describe seniority in organisations. This can lead to\nconfusion over the roles, responsibilities and hence skill, competency and capability\nrequirements, of senior management. This chapter examines the issues raised by board\nstructure and the roles and tasks of senior managers, which in turn strongly influence\napproaches to executive development.\n2.1 Structure of top teams and boards\nThe composition, characteristics and structure of a board or top team may vary from\norganisation to organisation (Korac-Kakabadse, Kakabadse & Kouzmin, 2001: 25). The\nterms \u201cboard\u201d and \u201ctop team\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably but they actually\nrepresent two different concepts. Figure 2.1 shows a typical structure of a for-profit\norganisation. The pattern for not-for-profit organisations is similar, although usually\nfeaturing a board of trustees (or elected representatives) rather than a board of directors.\n16\nFigure 2.1 For-profit board and top team schema\nBOARD OF\nDIRECTORS\nComprises a\nChairman, who\nmight be either\nexecutive or non-\nexecutive, the\nCEO, one or\nmore other\ndirectors, e.g.\nFinance Director,\nplus the non-\nexecutive\ndirectors\n\uf0a8 Statutory\n\uf0a8 Responsible for\nstrategy and\ngovernance\n\uf0a8 In the UK, there\nmay be a\nmajority of\nexecutive\ndirectors or\nequal numbers of\nexecs and non-\nexecs, or the\nother way round,\nalthough\nchanging more\nto US model\n\uf0a8 In the US,\ntypically,\none\/two\nexecutive\ndirectors, many\nnon-executives\nNon-executive director\n\uf0a8 Not involved in everyday running of\nthe business\n\uf0a8 Not employed full-time\n\uf0a8 Attends Board meetings\n\uf0a8 Advises Board\n\uf0a8 Ensures that Board maintains\nstandards of governance\n\uf0a8 Deals with shareholder matters\n\uf0a8 Deals with Board of directors\u2019\nremuneration\n\uf0a8 Legally accountable\n\uf0a8 Corporate representation\/Social\nResponsibility\nExecutive director\n\uf0a8 Involved in everyday running of the\nbusiness\n\uf0a8 Has responsibility for a part of the\nbusiness, either functional or\noperational, e.g. Finance Director\n\uf0a8 Employed full-time\n\uf0a8 May\/may not take corporate\nperspective\nTOP TEAM\nOR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n(Sometimes known as the\nManagement Committee)\nMight include all executive\ndirectors and other directors, e.g.\nHR Director, IT Director, plus\nHeads of Business Units\nORGANISATION (FOR-PROFIT)\n17\nThe board of a for-profit organisation consists of the chairman, CEO, perhaps one or\nmore other executive directors (for example, the finance director), and the non-executive\ndirectors. The top team, sometimes known as the executive committee or management\ncommittee, comprises the executive directors and possibly general managers responsible\nfor implementing strategy in the organisation. There is no \u201cideal\u201d board or top team, nor\nan \u201cideal\u201d way of working as a board or top team. What emerges is a mix of personalities,\ncompetencies and specialisms (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2001a: 11). As Tony Douglas,\nGroup Technical Director at BAA, points out: \u201cThere is the need for a kind of agility of\napproach that allows an open-thinking style that is not necessarily constrained by central\nrigor of absolutely explicit terms of reference that we may see in other types of forums.\u201d\nIn public service bodies, certain directors together with elected\/external representatives\nform the governing board. Despite this difference in board structure, private sector and\npublic service bodies both face similar strategic, leadership and development challenges,\nparticularly in attending to the demands of the stakeholders of public service bodies and\nthe shareholders and relevant stakeholders of a plc (Pierce, 2001).\nBoth private sector and public service boards are ultimately responsible for all decisions\nthroughout the organisation. On a UK board, there may be a majority of executive\ndirectors or an equal number of executives and non-executive directors, or the other way\nround. In the US, typically, there will be one or two executive directors, the remainder\nbeing non-executive directors. Despite variations of board membership, the board accepts\nDeleted: \u00b6\n\u00b6\n18\nultimate accountability, although most boards delegate considerable authority to other\nsenior managers (Dulewicz, MacMillan & Herbert, 1995: 5).\nThe Institute of Directors in the UK defines the board\u2019s key purpose as to \u201censure the\ncompany\u2019s prosperity by collectively directing the company\u2019s affairs whilst meeting the\nappropriate interests of its shareholders and relevant stakeholders\u201d (Pierce, 2001: 1). To\nadd to this, Steve Thompson, Director of HR and Social Responsibility at Camelot,\ncomments: \u201cI think one of the clear responsibilities of the executive team as a whole,\nwhether they are the Board of Directors or the functional directors, is to help the\norganisation achieve its strategic objectives, and also to have a role in setting and\nreviewing those objectives. At executive director level, clearly there\u2019s a shareholder\nresponsibility and there is also a wider responsibility in terms of governance in the\nbroadest sense of the word.\u201d\n2.2 Tasks of the chairman, CEO, non-executive and executive directors\nThe chairman exercises the ultimate responsibility, planning and running board meetings,\nand influencing standards for review and debate. Together with the CEO and the\ncompany secretary, it is the chairman who sets the corporate agenda (Dulewicz et al,\n1995: 5-8). In addition, with the trend towards well-defined corporate governance\nstructures, the chairman not only ensures that the board\u2019s work is transparent,\naccountable and ethical, but also takes responsibility for the board\u2019s development (Syrett\n& Lammiman, 1999: 152).\n19\nBoards face conflicting pressures. Some of their tasks are concerned with the\nperformance of the organisation, while others are to do with compliance with the law and\nother standards. Some tasks require the board to look inward, for example, in setting its\nstructure and strategy, while others require it to look outward, for example, being\naccountable to shareholders and other stakeholders. Some tasks focus on the future, for\nexample, determining purpose, vision and values, whilst other tasks focus on the past or\npresent, for example, analysis of past performance and delegating new actions to\nmanagement. The director must therefore understand the internal environment of the\norganisation, as well as the external environment. The paradox is that a director also\nneeds to be able to focus on the future of the business while at the same time\nconcentrating on current performance (Pierce, 2001: 3).\nKorac-Kakabadse and colleagues take this complexity further by examining the service,\ncontrol and strategic roles of the board as well as its tasks within each of these roles (see\nFigure 2.2).\n20\nService role Control role Strategic role\n\uf0a7 Co-opt corporation\n\uf0a7 Control corporation\n\uf0a7 Enhance corporate\nreputation\n\uf0a7 Formulate and implement\ndecision-making\n\uf0a7 Safeguard interests of\nshareholders\n\uf0a7 Select CEO\n\uf0a7 Monitor\nCEO\/management\nperformance\n\uf0a7 Review CEO\u2019s analyses\n\uf0a7 Rectify executive\ndecisions\n\uf0a7 Separate decision control\nfrom decision\nmanagement\n\uf0a7 Guide corporate\nmission\n\uf0a7 Develop, implement\nand monitor the\nfirm\u2019s strategy\n\uf0a7 Allocate resources\n\uf0a7 Span boundaries\nFigure 2.2 Board roles\n(Source: adapted from Korac-Kakabadse et al, 2001: 25)\n21\nWithin the broad range of activities, certain commentators maintain that the board\u2019s most\nimportant function is to select the CEO (Atkins, 2001: 14). The CEO has the\nresponsibility for developing plans that reflect the longer-term objectives and priorities\nestablished by the board. He or she also maintains a dialogue with the chairman of the\nboard, puts in place adequate operational planning and financial control systems, ensures\nthat the operating objectives and standards of performance are not only understood but\nalso \u201cowned\u201d by the management and other employees, monitors operating and financial\nresults against plans and budgets, takes remedial action where necessary and informs the\nboard of significant changes. It is critical that the CEO pays constant attention to the\ncompany\u2019s operational performance (Pierce, 2001: 16).\nAlthough the CEO\u2019s main role is to lead the executive team of directors in carrying out\nthe above tasks (Dulewicz et al, 1995: 5), in today\u2019s flatter organisational structures it is\nrecognised that CEOs are no longer as powerful as they once were. That \u2018power\u2019 has\npassed from the CEO to coalitions of senior managers with both executive and non-\nexecutive status (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001a: 9). The idea of a single leader, as\nepitomised in the hierarchical pyramid headed by an all-powerful individual (Thompson,\n1967: 143), is being replaced by that of a nucleus of senior executives forming the top\nteam. Despite such sharing, the CEO remains the ultimate point of accountability,\nacknowledging that \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d a point that the former CEO of Royal and\nSunAlliance, Bob Mendelsohn, accepted with great dignity (see update on Royal and\nSunAlliance, p. 138).\n22\nThe CEO represents the cadre of senior executives to the board and the outside world and\nit is on their performance that he or she stands or falls. Executive performance includes\nthe philosophy and attitudes of each individual executive, as well as the collective spirit\nof the team and the way in which communication between colleagues affects team\nperformance and manifests itself in the image and reputation of the organisation. With\nsuch a need for teamwork, the CEO can all too easily lose the confidence of the board\nand, more generally, the media, either because of perceived poor decisions or because of\ninappropriate executive style. Critical media comment is an important factor as it\nundermines investor confidence and hence share price (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2001a:\n9).\nBeing able to balance successfully the diverse range of interest groups is the difference\nbetween staying in the job and dismissal. As Steve Thompson of Camelot observes: \u201cWe\ndo feel entrusted with this national institution and a great sense of responsibility about\nnot wanting or allowing it to become corrupted in any way, shape or form, so I think that\nis a really important part of the sort of behaviour that the leadership must display.\u201d\nNon-executive directors are not involved in the day-to-day running of the business and\nare not employed full-time by the corporation. They attend board meetings, advise the\nboard, ensure that the board maintains its standards of governance, deal with shareholder\nmatters and decide director remuneration. Their position is valued for the external\nperspective that they are able to bring to the organisation, but along with this there are\ncertain limitations due to the restrictions of corporate secrecy and competition.\n23\nExecutive directors represent the internal view of the firm. They attend the executive\ncommittee (sometimes known as the management committee) and report to the CEO.\nThey have responsibility for a part of the business, either functional or operational, and\nthey are employed full-time by the corporation. According to the culture of the\norganisation, they can be held accountable for just their own areas of responsibility or\nmore broadly as members of a corporate team. Their primary purpose is to shape strategic\npriorities, enforce operating standards, establish corporate policy and develop\nmanagement talent. The executive committee members set the direction, mission and\npolicies for the business (Katzenbach, 1997: 84).\n2.3 Skills, competencies and capabilities\nIn light of the tasks and roles of the top team and board members explored above, what\nare the skills, competencies and capabilities required of them? Contrasting views are\noffered here. However, most writers, irrespective of the stance they adopt, agree that\nsenior managers in any organisation need a balance of all three elements (Kakabadse &\nKorac-Kakabadse, 2000: 113).\n2.3.1. Defining terms\n\u201cSkill\u201d is regarded as a specific expertise that can be taught. \u201cCompetencies\u201d are\nan aggregate of individual skills necessary to resolve more complex problems.\nBoth skills and competencies are considered generic terms, and may be used in\n24\nany context. \u201cCapability\u201d is the ability to apply both skills and competencies in a\nparticular context in a way that is perceived to add value.\nKakabadse and Korac-Kakabadse (2000) identify three separate work domains in\norganisations in which skills, competencies and capabilities fit. The study\nconcludes that:\n\uf0a7 More operational work activity requires the application of particular job-\nrelated operational skills, such as IT skills, which are linked to the demands\nand requirements of particular activity-related roles.\n\uf0a7 Dealing with challenges of a broader organisational nature requires\ncompetency in making and implementing decisions and applying management\ntools and techniques, such as customer relationship management, human\nresource management and project management.\n\uf0a7 Tackling challenges of a more strategic nature, which involve promoting a\nvision for the enterprise, representing issues to influential internal and external\nstakeholders and balancing short-term against long-term considerations,\nrequires leadership capabilities of a higher order to guarantee corporate-wide\nsuccess (see Figure 2.3).\n25\nFigure 2.3 Work domains showing skills, competencies and capabilities\n(Source: adapted from Kakabadse & Korac-Kakabadse, 2000: 111)\nExecutive\ncapabilities\n26\n2.3.2 Knowledge and competencies required by board directors\nA study into Standards of Good Practice for UK Boards of Directors carried out\nby the Institute of Directors (1995) identified twelve broad areas of knowledge\nand six broad areas of competency required by board directors.\nThe areas of knowledge are:\nMatters relating to the\nboard itself\nMatters relating to the\nexternal environment\nTechnical subjects\nThe memorandum and\narticles of association\nKey trends Corporate finance and\naccounting\nRoles, relationships and\nprocesses\nPEST influences Contemporary business\nthinking and\ndevelopments\nCorporate governance Evaluation of strategic\noptions and risks\nSelection, appraisal and\nremuneration of\ndirectors\nPublic affairs\nDevelopment of\ndirectors\nCorporate\ncommunications\nThe broad areas of competency are:\n1. strategic perception and decision-making;\n2. analytical understanding;\n3. communication;\n4. interacting with others;\n5. board management;\n6. achieving results.\n27\nAdditional to competency and knowledge is the way each director is perceived.\nAs Priscilla Vacassin, Group HR Director at BAA, puts it: \u201cIn competence terms\nfor senior levels, it is the perception that it is critical.\u201d People throughout the\ncompany have to see and believe in the capability of their leaders.\n2.3.3 Performance requirements of the chairman\nFor a board to ensure the organisation\u2019s continuing prosperity, the chairman needs\na broad range of skills, competencies and particularly capabilities. The planning\nand effective conduct of board meetings is vital and for this, a chairman must be\npolitically capable and able to marry personal agendas in a way that engages all\nboard members. He or she will need to act as a mentor and confidant to fellow\nboard members and be responsible for their personal and collective development\n(Harper, 2000: 2). Such an array of personal abilities and qualities are elements of\ncapability.\n2.3.4 Performance requirements of the CEO\nThe CEO also needs a broad range of skills, competencies and capabilities. At the\nskill and competency end of the scale, her or she must have an understanding of\nquantitative performance indicators, such as share price, and specialist\nbackground experience, such as merger experience or marketing expertise. These\nqualities have to be balanced with qualitative capabilities, such as being able to\npromote a vision, the capacity to inspire passion and conviction and, most\n28\nimportantly, leadership quality. Leadership in this context refers to a\nconglomerate of personal behaviours, political skills and people skills. Therefore,\nwhen recruiting a CEO, it is important to ask the following questions (Atkins,\n2001: 14):\n\uf0a7 Has the candidate demonstrated the capability to lead and to develop talent?\n\uf0a7 Can this leader energise others?\n\uf0a7 Is he or she comfortable delegating power?\n\uf0a7 Does this leader hold his or her team accountable for fulfilling promises and\nachieving agreed performance objectives?\n\uf0a7 Does he or she inspire people to follow and trust them? Does he or she listen\nto others in a respectful way?\n\uf0a7 Does this leader share information, resources, praise and credit?\nPriscilla Vacassin at BAA acknowledges the importance of leadership: \u201cThe way\nthat you work can be done in a leadership way or it can be in a non-leadership\nway. As leaders of the business, particularly at senior level if you are not doing\nthem in a leadership way you are probably not really doing them, and your\nimpact is going to be very ineffective in the way that you apply that.\u201d\n2.3.5 Performance requirements of the non-executive director\nNon-executive directors require a range of competencies and capabilities,\nincluding financial, marketing and branding literacy, sector expertise, city\ncontacts and experience of mergers, acquisitions and change.\n29\nIt has also been suggested that softer skills required include mentoring, coaching\nand independence of mind (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2001a: 9). However, at this\nlevel of seniority, external non-executive directors are rarely given the opportunity\nto apply such capabilities due to a lack of time and low levels of trust.\nThe critical performance requirements of non-executives hence emerge as being\nable to:\n\uf0a8 make a strategic contribution without becoming too involved;\n\uf0a8 adopt a flexible mindset, knowing how to operate in different contexts;\n\uf0a8 reconcile the differences between the chairman, CEO and executive directors;\n\uf0a8 ensure good governance while retaining the confidentiality and trust of other\nboard members and executive directors (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2001a: 9).\nIn other words, they need to be both \u201cpolice\u201d and confidants (Dulewicz et al,\n1995: 7). At a more operational level, development needs will be concerned\nmainly with improving meeting and chairmanship skills (Kakabadse &\nKakabadse, 2001a: 9).\n2.3.6 Performance requirements of the executive director\nA survey carried out by the Institute of Directors (1998) examined the\nperformance requirements of an effective director. They emerged as being capable\nof strategic awareness and thinking, vision, leadership, taking a long-term\n30\ndimension and having a \u2018big picture\u2019 or objective orientation, and including a\ncommunications dimension.\nDeborah Loudon, Director of Personnel at the Home Office, believes the main\npriority is that \u201cthe more senior you become the more adaptability becomes\ncrucial.\u201d Ultimately, however, ticking off the checklist of capabilities is not\nimportant. \u201cAlthough we are saying to people you can do pretty well what you\nwant as a leader, you can behave in lots of different ways, the acid test is: are you\ndoing what you need to do given your business? [\u2026] This actually takes people\naway from the style debate and into the effective business performance debate,\u201d\npoints out Priscilla Vacassin, Group HR Director at BAA. Steve Thompson at\nCamelot agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s an aspect about operating and delivering against our\nnew stated vision, behaviours and values which, at this senior level, are\nabsolutely critical.\u201d\nNote how similar are the challenges facing senior executives in the range of\norganisations studied here. Margaret Aldred at the Home Office comments that:\n\u201cOne of the things that working in three departments has taught me is actually\nthat the generic issues and the generic principles [facing senior executives] are\nvery similar.\u201d This is in reference to capabilities required at senior level, not the\nvaried technical skills that are in demand at lower levels of the organisation.\nHowever, meeting such challenges is the critical issue. Dianne Thompson, Chief\nExecutive of Camelot, recognises that \u201cyou can develop people in terms of the\n31\nskills set and the knowledge base that they\u2019ve got, but you can\u2019t always develop\nthe attitudes with which they approach certain things.\u201d Thus dealing with the\ndemands of each organisation in a manner that captures people\u2019s attention is vital.\nPriscilla Vacassin observes that \u201cthe problem that we had when we started looking\nat competency models was they were quite often complex with a good degree of\ntaxonomy even at the very senior level. [\u2026] We wanted something that was going\nto engage people emotionally and provide them with a very clear guideline\nwithout having to actually define what that meant in detail.\u201d Which, for BAA,\nmeant designing their own generic leadership competency model.\nFrom the case study interviews and from the literature, it clearly emerges that\nexecutive directors need to integrate functional duties and demands more closely\nwith corporate ones than often currently is the case. Margaret Aldred comments\non \u201cthe difficulty of getting the board to think how it operates as a corporate\nboard as opposed to a collection of people who have executive responsibilities\nthat they discuss at board level.\u201d Similarly, Deborah Loudon, also of the Home\nOffice, states that \u201cwe tend, in practice, quite rightly, to value people who do their\nsubject really well and then we struggle with how to make those people also be\ncollective and responsible at the corporate level.\u201d Perhaps this is an issue of\ncorporate identity more than anything: \u201cThe Home Office hasn\u2019t traditionally had\na strong corporate focus; it's had a focus which is based on its component parts\u201d\n(Margaret Aldred). Or perhaps an issue of day-to-day reality: \u201cThe strategic role\nis constantly hijacked by short-term expediency and often that is a political\n32\nexpediency\u201d (Eithne Wallis, National Director of the Probation Service for\nEngland and Wales).\n2.4 Leadership at top team and board level\nLeadership is arguably the most important capability required by members of top teams\nand boards. It is a theme that recurs constantly in any discussion on executive\ndevelopment. However, leadership is not a clearly defined concept: \u201cI think like many\norganisations, we've been struggling a great deal with what we mean by leadership, how\nto improve it, how to define it\u201d (Deborah Loudon, Director of Personnel at the Home\nOffice).\nThis section sets out to provide a chronological account of the different leadership\ntheories emerging. We begin with a definition of the capabilities required by a successful\nleader before exploring the detail of approaches to leadership.\nAccording to Kakabadse and Kakabadse (1999: 2), an effective leader is \u201cable to\nrecognize the appropriateness of actions relevant to the circumstances of the situation.\u201d\nThey go on to say that \u201cin today\u2019s world, any analysis of leadership requires exploration\nof what makes the leader function, but equally required is an examination of the culture\nand context of an organization, and also of followership.\u201d A strong underlying theme of\nthe leadership literature is that successful leaders display the capability to appreciate the\nnature of the challenges in their context. There is no one style of leadership that will fit\nevery situation.\n33\n2.4.1 Trait theory\nConsiderable attention has been paid to the traits displayed by powerful and\nsuccessful leaders, notably by the media who identify people such as Margaret\nThatcher, Ronald Reagan and Nelson Mandela as outstanding leaders and\ndescribe them in terms such as charismatic, enthusiastic and courageous (Robbins,\n1998: 348).\nTrait-based research identified at least six traits that tended to distinguish leaders\nfrom non-leaders: ambition and energy, the desire to lead, honesty and integrity,\nself-confidence, intelligence and job-relevant knowledge. However, this theory\nhas been criticised as not providing insights into the differences between\nsuccessful leaders (Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1991: 48 \u2013 60). Although certain traits\nhave been shown to increase the likelihood of success as a leader, researchers\nhave not been able to identify one set of traits that would apply to all effective\nleaders (Yukl & Van Fleet, 1992: 150).\n2.4.2 Behavioural theory\nBecause of the weaknesses of trait theory, researchers began to examine the\nbehaviours exhibited by specific leaders. For example, one study looked at two\nchairmen who were both successful leaders of their organisations and who both\ndisplayed autocratic styles (Mulligan, 1993). It was then suggested that if an\n34\nautocratic style is a preferred style, potential leaders could be trained in a\nparticular style, rather than being selected for particular traits. This was a\nsignificant move away from the view that leadership is inborn, towards the idea\nthat leadership could be taught. The most notable research into behavioural theory\nwas carried out at Ohio State University in the late 1940s, although behavioural\nresearch continued with the University of Michigan Studies, the Blake and\nMouton managerial grid and the Scandinavian Studies until the 1960s (Robbins,\n1998: 349-353).\nThe missing dimension in these early approaches was the situational factor. Two\ndifferent leaders might both be effective and yet have different styles, work in\ndifferent sectors, and operate in different markets with different labour forces.\nTherefore, for executives at board level, different personal competencies and\nstyles have to be adopted as people and situations around them change. Margaret\nAldred, Director General of Resources and Performance at the Home Office, also\nemphasises this point: \u201cYou need different sorts of people with different sorts of\nbackgrounds and different perspectives in order to get different outcomes.\u201d\n2.4.3 Contingency theory\nFrom the assumption that identifying particular traits or distinct behaviours would\nsuffice, leadership research became more concerned with trying to isolate\nsituational influences. For example, the Fielder contingency model of the 1960s\nproposed that effective group performance depends on a match between the way a\n35\nleader interacts with his or her subordinates and the degree to which a particular\nsituation gives control and influence to the leader. This was followed by\nsituational theory (Hersey & Blanchard, 1974: 1-15). Situational leadership is a\nform of contingency theory that focuses on the leader as much as the followers.\nSuccessful leadership is achieved by selecting the \u2018right\u2019 leadership style for the\nlevel of the followers\u2019 readiness (Robbins, 1998: 358).\nAdditional contingency theories have been expounded, for example, leader-\nmember exchange (LMX) theory (Dansereau, Cashman & Graen, 1973: 184 \u2013\n200) and Path Goal Theory (House, 1971: 321 \u2013 338). The LMX theory argues\nthat leaders do not always treat their subordinates in a similar way, probably\nbecause of time pressures. Leaders tend to have a special relationship with a small\ngroup of their subordinates, who make up the \u2018in-group\u2019. The \u2018in-group\u2019 are\ntrusted, tend to receive more of the leader\u2019s attention and are more likely to enjoy\nspecial privileges. Other subordinates belong to the \u2018out-group\u2019 and receive less\nof the leader\u2019s time and fewer rewards and have a superior-subordinate\nrelationship based on formal authority interactions. How the leader selects the\nmembers of the \u2018in-group\u2019 or the \u2018out-group\u2019 does not clearly emerge, but there is\nevidence that those in the \u2018in-group\u2019 are chosen because of personal\ncharacteristics similar to those of the leader. The LMX theory predicts that in-\ngroup subordinates will have higher performance ratings, less turnover and greater\nsatisfaction with their superiors than those in the out-group (Robbins, 1998: 360 \u2013\n361).\n36\nThe essence of path-goal theory is that effective leaders make it easier for\nfollowers to achieve their goals by directing and\/or supporting them. Four\nleadership behaviours are identified that support this view. These are the directive\nleader, who lets subordinates know what is required of them, schedules work to be\ndone and gives specific guidance on how to accomplish tasks; the supportive\nleader, who is friendly and shows concern for the needs of their subordinates; the\nparticipative leader, who consults with subordinates and considers their ideas\nbefore making a decision; and the achievement-oriented leader, who sets\nchallenging goals and expects subordinates to perform at their highest level. Path-\ngoal theory assumes that leaders are flexible, so that the same leader can display\nany or all of the behaviours, depending on the situation. Research suggests that\nemployee performance and satisfaction are likely to be positively influenced when\nthe leader compensates for areas lacking in either the employee or the work\nsetting (Robbins, 1998: 361 \u2013 362).\n2.4.4 Attribution theory\nEmerging out of contingency-based thinking, attribution theory attempts to\nunderstand the nature of cause-effect relationships, especially in the way\nleadership is used to explain organisational outcomes. If organisational\nperformance is poor, CEOs become vulnerable, regardless of their contribution to\nthat performance. Conversely, if organisational performance is good, the CEO is\n37\ngiven credit, regardless of how much or how little they contributed (Robbins,\n1998: 369 \u2013 370).\n2.4.5 Charismatic leadership theory\nAn extension of attribution theory, charismatic leadership explores why followers\nbestow attributes of heroism or extraordinary leadership abilities on people in\nwhom they observe certain behaviours, for example, John F. Kennedy, Martin\nLuther King and Walt Disney. The most comprehensive research into personal\ncharacteristics of the charismatic leader was carried out by Conger, Kanungo and\nAssociates (1988: 91) at McGill University. It was observed that \u201ccharismatic\nleaders have an idealised goal that they want to achieve, a strong personal\ncommitment to their goal, are perceived as unconventional, are assertive and self-\nconfident, and are perceived as agents of radical change rather than managers of\nthe status quo\u201d (Robbins, 1998: 371).\nWhether leaders are born with charismatic qualities or whether they can be taught\nis a question that has been widely debated. Certain commentators believe that\nindividuals can be trained (Conger et al, 1988; Howell & Frost, 1989; Richardson\n& Thayer, 1993). However, charismatic leaders tend to surface at times of tension,\nfor example, wartime or when a business is facing a crisis. When there is no crisis,\ncharismatic leaders may be a liability because of their overwhelming self-\nconfidence, inability to listen to others and belief in their own rightness (House,\n1977).\n38\n2.4.6 Transactional and transformational leadership theory\nMoving away from a focus on leadership alone, the transactional\/transformational\ndebate explores the balance between leadership and managerial requirements.\nLeadership is held to be different from management in several ways (Zaleznik,\n1986: 54). For example, managers might adopt an impersonal and passive attitude\ntowards achieving goals, whereas a leader will personally identify with the goals\ntowards which they strive. Similarly, managers may see their role as bringing\ntogether people and ideas. Leaders on the other hand work from high-risk\npositions and are considered as temperamentally disposed to taking risks,\nparticularly when opportunities and rewards appear high.\nThe terms leadership and management are often confused, particularly in relation\nto management or executive development. Steve Thompson, Director of HR and\nSocial Responsibility at Camelot, recognises this dilemma in his own\norganisation: \u201cIf you included, as we tend to, the executive as part of\nmanagement, then there\u2019s a lot of material around management development, but\nwe don\u2019t currently have a document that we could say this is our guide to\ndeveloping executive directors.\u201d\nA contrasting view of the differences between managers and leaders is that\nmanagement and leadership are two distinctive and complementary systems of\naction, each with its own function and characteristics (Kotter, 1990: 103). Both\n39\nare necessary for business success. Management deals with complexity whereas,\nin contrast, leadership is concerned with change. Kakabadse and Kakabadse\n(1999: 4 \u2013 5) agree and they too point to the contrast between leadership and\nmanagement, but at the same time they believe that both are required in today\u2019s\nleaders. This, they say, is where \u201ctwo words capture the uneasy fit between\nleading and managing, namely \u2018transformational\u2019 and \u2018transactional\u2019\n[leadership].\u201d\nTransactional leaders guide or motivate their followers in the direction of\nestablished goals by clarifying role and task requirements. However, those who\ndemonstrate superior leadership performance are known as transformational\nleaders. They differ from transactional leaders in that they \u201cbroaden and elevate\nthe interests of their employees, generate awareness and acceptance of the\npurposes and mission of the group, and stir their employees to look beyond their\nown self-interest for the good of the group\u201d (Bass, 1990: 20 \u2013 21).\nThe transactional leader achieves success by making and fulfilling promises of\nrecognition, pay increases and advancement for good performance, and by\nimposing penalties for poor performance. In other words, transactional leadership\nepitomises the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d approach, with little thought given to how\nemployees think, what they feel and who they are as individuals. Transactional\nleadership focuses not on developing followers to their fullest potential but on\n\u201csatisfying the requirements of the exchange between themselves and their\n40\nfollowers\u201d (Bass & Avolio, 1990: 21 \u2013 22). Transactional leadership can lead to\nmediocre outcomes, particularly when the leader only intervenes with his or her\ngroup when procedures and standards for accomplishing tasks are not met.\nFor transformational leadership, instead of responding to followers with either a\n\u201ccarrot\u201d or a \u201cstick\u201d, leaders inspire them through their charisma; they meet the\nemotional needs of each employee; and\/or they stimulate employees\nintellectually. Of these, charisma is seen as the most important characteristic of a\nsuccessful leader (Bass, 1990: 21). Transformational leaders are capable of having\na profound and extraordinary effect on their followers, for example, Jack Welch at\nGeneral Electric.\nHowever, transformational leadership goes beyond charismatic leadership (Avolio\n& Bass, 1985: 14): \u201cThe purely charismatic [leader] may want followers to adopt\nthe charismatic\u2019s world view and go no further; the transformational leader will\nattempt to instil in followers the ability to question not only established views but\neventually those established by the leader.\u201d\nAlthough transactional and transformational leadership are described as distinct,\nboth may need to be displayed by the same person. \u201cThe capability to lead must\nbe coupled with the practical skills that leaders need to have to manage their day-\nto-day affairs, which range from administration, to working through with people\nthe tactical demands which require immediate response\u201d (Kakabadse and\n41\nKakabadse, 1999: 3 \u2013 5). Thus leaders need to be ethical and political at the same\ntime. They need to be sensitive to people, and yet drive through change. They\nneed to be attentive to detail, yet quick to grasp and pursue half-formed\npossibilities. Leadership involves constantly dealing with contrasts, contradictions\nand paradoxes.\nFigure 2.4 demonstrates some of the differences between transactional and\ntransformational leaders. It shows that effective leaders need to manage efficiently\ncertain routine tasks, not only to maintain their credibility and effectiveness but\nalso to keep the organisation on the desired course.\n42\nTransformational Attributes Transactional Attributes\nApproach Innovative (creates opportunity,\nimagines new areas to explore)\nBalance of operations\nFocus On vision, values, expectations\nand context\nOn control, production and\nresults\nMotivates through Volitional activity (emotion,\noffering suggestions)\nFormal authority mechanisms\nUses Influence (power) Control\nValues Co-operation, unity, equality,\njustice and fairness in addition\nto efficiency and effectiveness\nCo-ordination, efficiency and\neffectiveness\nCommunication Indirectly and directly, giving\noverlapping and ambiguous\nassignment\nDirectly, giving clear direction,\nsolitary assignment\nMain tasks Defines and communicates\ngoals, motivates\nImplements goals, referees,\ncoaches\nThinking time-\nframe\nFuturistic (tomorrow and the\nday after)\nCurrent (yesterday\u2019s output and\ntoday\u2019s problems)\nThinking context Global Local\nMain direction Renewal Maintenance\nFigure 2.4 Distinguishing transformational from transactional leadership\n(Source: Adapted from Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999: 5 \u2013 6)\n43\nThe one variable that can determine the appropriate balance between transactional\nand transformational approaches to leadership is context. One situation may\nrequire greater attention to detail and tasks. In another, driving through change\nand winning people\u2019s hearts and minds may need to be top priority. Because of\nmarket and societal dynamism, a combination of both approaches may be\nrequired.\n2.4.7 Visionary leadership theory\nThe case for visionary leadership has been made by a number of commentators.\nFor example, Nanus (1992: 178 \u2013 179) wrote passionately that:\n\u201cthe 21st-century organization virtually demands visionary leadership.\nIt cannot function without it, for an organization driven by\naccelerating technological change, staffed by a diverse, multicultural\nmix of highly intelligent knowledge workers, facing global complexity,\na vast kaleidoscope of individual customer needs, and the incessant\ndemands of multiple constituencies would simply self-destruct without\na common sense of direction.\u201d\nVision binds people into a group with a common goal and, in terms of employees,\nwhen vision is shared it can \u201ckeep an entire company moving forward in the face\nof difficulties, enabling and inspiring leaders and employees alike\u201d (Snyder &\nGraves, 1994: 2).\n44\nJust as there is overlap between charismatic leadership and transformational\nleadership, so there is overlap between transformational leadership and visionary\nleadership. Martin Luther King, Jr., believed that, for vision to be realised, it\nneeds a champion. A motivating vision, by its nature, implies business or\norganisational innovation, which often departs in a significant way from past\npractice, requiring quite different organisational capabilities. The presence of a\nchampion in promoting innovation is required to identify the idea as his or her\nown, to promote it vigorously through informal networks, and to risk his or her\nposition and prestige to ensure the innovation\u2019s success. These champion-driven\nbehaviours are similar to the qualities of transformational leaders. From the\nperspective of the transformational leadership literature, which links\ntransformational leadership to the innovation process, it can be concluded that in\norder to promote innovation in an organisation, it is likely that champions will\nexhibit transformational leadership behaviour, and that, by the same token,\ntransformational leaders will also be visionary leaders (Oberg, 1972; House, 1977;\nBass, 1985; Conger & Kanungo, 1987).\n2.4.8 Servant leadership theory\nServant leadership (Greenleaf, 1977; Baggett, 1997; Covey, 1990; Manz, 1998;\nRinehart, 1998; Turner, 2000) is a concept that is gaining in popularity, perhaps\nbecause of the counterweight it provides to the notion of powerful top-down\nleadership by introducing values such as service, collegiality and care. Although it\nis an attractive concept, it is not yet supported by a body of empirical research.\n45\nThe main case for servant leadership is that proposed by Greenleaf (1978), who\nargued that there is a leadership crisis, and that colleges, universities and\nseminaries are failing to prepare young people for leadership roles in society.\n\u201cThe need [for leadership] was never so great. A chronic crisis of governance,\nthat is, the pervasive incapacity of organisations to cope with the expectations of\ntheir constituents, is now an overwhelming factor worldwide\u201d (Bennis & Nanus,\n1997: 2).\nServant leadership is based on the premise that the prime motivation for\nleadership should be a desire to serve others. In the workplace, for example,\nleaders should assume the position of servant in their relationship with fellow\nworkers rather than be motivated by self-interest. Servant leadership is manifest as\na higher plane of motivation that is concerned with meeting the needs of others\n(Greenleaf, 1977; Pollard, 1996; Wilkes, 1996):\n\u201cAs long as power dominates our thinking about leadership, we cannot\nmove towards a higher standard of leadership. We must place service at\nthe core; for even though power will always be associated with\nleadership, it has only one legitimate use: service\u201d (Nair, 1994: 59).\nThe literature on servant leadership is rather ambiguous and anecdotal in\nestablishing the characteristics or attributes of servant leaders. However,\nGreenleaf (1977) identified ten core attributes of servant leadership, although they\n46\nare by no means exhaustive: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion,\nconceptualisation, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people,\nand building community.\nRussell and Stone (2002: 146-147) list twenty attributes of servant leadership that\nhave been identified by successive writers on the subject, incorporating the ten\nGreenleaf (1977) attributes listed above. They divide these into nine functional\nattributes and eleven accompanying attributes as described below.\nFunctional attributes Accompanying attributes\n1. Vision 1. Communication\n2. Honesty 2. Credibility\n3. Integrity 3. Competence\n4. Trust 4. Stewardship\n5. Service 5. Visibility\n6. Modelling 6. Influence\n7. Pioneering 7. Persuasion\n8. Appreciation of others 8. Listening\n9. Empowerment 9. Encouragement\n10. Teaching\n11. Delegation\nThe nine functional attributes, which result from their \u2018repetitive prominence\u2019 in\nthe literature, are the \u201coperative qualities, characteristics and distinctive features\nbelonging to leaders and observed through specific leader behaviors in the\nworkplace.\u201d They go on to explain that \u201cthe functional attributes are the effective\ncharacteristics of servant leadership.\u201d The eleven accompanying attributes\n\u201cappear to supplement and augment the functional attributes\u201d and, rather than\nbeing secondary in nature, they complement the functional attributes and are in\n47\nsome cases pre-requisites to servant leadership (Russell & Stone, 2002: 146 \u2013\n147).\nAlthough these twenty attributes form the basis of an as yet undeveloped model of\nservant leadership, they do provide scope for practitioners and researchers to\napply and study this concept. \u201cBecoming servant leaders engages us in personal,\ninternal self-change and changes our outward behavior\u201d (Fairholm, 1997: 149).\nThus, the importance of servant leadership lies in its potential to transform\norganisations and societies: \u201cServant leadership offers the potential to positively\nrevolutionize interpersonal work relations and organizational life\u201d (Russell &\nStone, 2002: 154). It is also argued that \u201cleaders primarily shape the cultures of\ntheir organisations through modelling important values\u201d (Russell & Stone, 2002:\n145 \u2013 157).\nIt follows that leaders who fail to identify key organisational values, and to\nconvey and reinforce them through personal example and by establishing\nappropriate policies, show a lack of ethical leadership that, in turn, fosters an\nunethical organisational culture. Top leaders need to act as role models because\ntheir behaviour produces far-reaching results. It affects not only those employees\nwho report to them, but also the other stakeholders in the organisation, for\nexample, shareholders, suppliers and customers, and, possibly, the wider\ncommunity (Sims & Brinkmann, 2002: 329).\n48\nOne organisation recognises how images of leadership have changed over time:\n\u201cThe template for the 'ideal leader' in any organisation is not the same\ntoday as it was ten years ago, and it will not be a good fit for the needs\nof five years hence - not least because leadership is inextricably linked\nto situations. Even if some basic leadership characteristics remain\nconstant, the ways in which those need to be manifested are subject to\nchange - personal style matters. This implies that development needs do\nnot evaporate when an individual 'makes it' to the top. If anything they\nincrease, especially in the early days there, and since the situations\nwhich leaders encounter are often novel and usually unpredictable,\nthere can be no 'one size fits all' teaching of leadership skills\u201d\n(Whitehead Mann, The Change Partnership, 2002).\n2.5 Governance and executive development\nWith growing public expectations for leaders to be ethical and accountable, coupled with\nan emerging cynicism towards the ethics of senior managers, the topic of corporate\ngovernance has come to prominence. Unethical behaviour in organisations has generated\nmany a headline in recent times.\nIn the following sections we look at the impact of different governance models on society\nat large and on executive development in particular on the basis of two contrasting\nmodels, the stakeholder model and the shareholder model.\n49\n2.5.1 Corporate governance: principles and practice\nCorporate governance is concerned with \u201cholding to account the modern\ncorporation, whether it be a large or small holding company and subsidiaries,\nlisted, private, government or non-profit entity\u201d (Kakabadse & Kakabadse,\n2001b: 19).\nFollowing concerns in recent years about the standards of accountability and\nfinancial reporting of UK-quoted companies, a number of committees were\nestablished to report on the governance of these companies, notably, the Cadbury\nReport (1992), the Greenbury Report (1995), and the Hampel Report (1998).\nThese reports \u201ccalled for greater transparency and accountability in areas such\nas board structure and operation, directors\u2019 contracts and the establishment of\nboard monitoring committees. They all stressed the importance of the non-\nexecutive directors\u2019 monitoring role\u201d (Weir & Laing, 2001: 86).\nIn 1998 the Committee for Corporate Governance published a set of Principles of\nGood Governance and Code of Best Practice, which embraced Cadbury,\nGreenbury and the Committee\u2019s own work. The principles cover five areas,\nnamely board composition, directors\u2019 remuneration, relations with shareholders,\naccountability and audit, and institutional investors (Hampel, 1998).\n50\nThe work maps out a framework for how listed companies should identify,\nevaluate and manage significant risks. It recommends that directors establish\ncontrols and assess the effectiveness of their systems to handle risk, irrespective\nof that risk. For example, risk may refer to supply-chain issues, environmental or\nhealth and safety standards or other issues. Executive management is identified as\nresponsible for managing risk, while the board is responsible for reporting on the\nperformance and effectiveness of executive management to shareholders at the\nAnnual General Meeting. Compliance with the Hampel (1998) guidelines has\nbecome a condition for listing on the London Stock Exchange (Kakabadse &\nKakabadse, 2001b: 49).\nFurther, good governance requires boards to monitor the performance of directors,\njustify the structure of their boards, highlight the role and contribution of\nexternal\/non-executive directors and the chairman of the board, and to take\naccount of the views of shareholders, particularly in terms of challenging\ndirectors\u2019 rewards (Felton, Hudnut & Witt, 1995: 162 \u2013 175). Through greater\nattention to governance practice, boards are more likely to take part in \u201csetting\nstandards for business values and ethics, and develop or approve policies in such\ncritical areas as finance and accounting, mergers and acquisitions, major capital\nexpenditure, the environment, safety, employee relations and legal retirement\nobligations\u201d (Felton, Hudnut & Witt, 1995: 162 \u2013 175).\n51\n2.5.2 Comparison between stakeholder and shareholder models\nThe macro (stakeholder) perspective of corporate governance is \u201cto maximise\nwealth creation in a manner that does not impose inappropriate costs on third\nparties or on society as a whole\u201d (Monks & Minow, 1996: 162). Wealth in this\ncontext means wealth created for employees and the community as well as\ninvestors, which requires control and supervision in order to minimise\nstakeholders\u2019 claims for damage or loss.\nStakeholder-based governance refers to how the organisation makes cost-effective\ndecisions in terms of wealth creation but with consideration of stakeholders\u2019\nrights. It involves \u201cmaximising wealth in a sustainable way and managing\nchange, which requires a balance of power between the distinct elements of the\ncorporation\u201d (Monks & Minow, 1996). This means that corporations have\n\u201cmultiple responsibilities, needing to balance competing conditions, such as long\nand short-term notion of gain, profit and sustainability, cash and accounting\nconcepts of value, democracy and authority, power and accountability\u201d\n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001b: 19). The stakeholder model tends to be most\ncommon in continental Europe and Japan.\nIn contrast is the micro (shareholder) approach to corporate governance, which is\nconcerned with maximising wealth creation for shareholders, with less\nconsideration for stakeholder interests. Here, control is linked chiefly to\n52\nprofitability; this is known as the \u2018shareholder value\u2019 perspective, or the Anglo-\nAmerican model (Franks & Mayer, 1993: 1 \u2013 15).\nThe sourcing of funding and capital is the main difference between the two\nmodels. In the stakeholder model, funding is supplied principally through bank\nloans. Banks, as stakeholders, undertake risk to loan money to the firm. This\nmeans that they will require \u201cmanagerial consideration and response\u201d from those\nrunning the firm (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001b: 19). In the shareholder\nmodel, \u201cstockholders advance capital to managers who act as their agents in pre-\nauthorized ways\u201d (Bowie & Freeman, 1992). Because shareholders usually buy\nshares with the aim of maximising the return on their investment, the main\nresponsibility of the firm\u2019s directors is to \u201cuse its resources and engage in\nactivities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the\ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition, without deception or\nfraud\u201d (Friedman, 1962: 133). The firm has no other social responsibility. To\ncreate shareholder wealth, management needs to outperform \u201cthe expectations\nshareholders had when they made their investment decision(s)\u201d (Kilroy, 1999: 74\n\u2013 79).\nInterest rates for loans in continental Europe are generally lower than in the USA\nor the UK, offering companies the capacity to \u201cspread\u201d payments on their\nborrowings (Sproule, 1999: 26). For example, German domestic savings are\npredominantly invested in banks and building societies, providing banks with a\n53\npool of money they can lend to companies (Kaufman, 1992). With savings\naccounts currently attracting low interest rates, banks only need to achieve\nnominal margins to show an acceptable level of profit. Because there is no\npressure from shareholders for high returns, it is possible to foster longer-term\nrelationships with client companies (Sproule, 1999: 26). German firms can\ntherefore make investments with greater availability of cash flow, allowing for a\nsubstantial proportion of funds to be used to support innovation through research\nand development (Thomas & Waring, 1999: 729 \u2013 748).\nWhether a macro\/societal or a more micro\/corporate perspective is adopted, the\ncentral theme of governance remains control (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2001b:\n35). The difference is that in the shareholder, or Anglo-American model of\ncorporate governance, the focus is on institutional agents monitoring corporate\nagents in order to enhance the investment prospects of investors (Monks &\nMinow, 1996). In the stakeholder model, that has evolved in most continental\nEuropean economies and in Japan, the premise is that a company is more likely to\nperform well, and the shareholders are more likely to benefit, if opportunities are\ncreated for the various groups holding an interest in the company to enter into a\nbinding relationship (Schmidt & Tyrell, 1997: 333 \u2013 361).\nThe emphasis in the stakeholder model is on the way enterprises are governed,\nwhich is quite distinct from the shareholder model, where the emphasis is on the\nway enterprises are managed (Kakabadse & Kakabadse, 2001b: 19).\n54\nThe UK (shareholder model) approach to corporate governance is characterised\nby a single-tier board, while, for example, in the German (stakeholder) model, a\ntwo-tier board structure predominates. One view emphasises that the single-tier\nstructure is more efficient in terms of responsiveness to business opportunity.\nHowever, a number of corporate governance practitioners and academics consider\nthe two-tier structure board to be advantageous in providing more effective\nmonitoring than the unitary structure, leading to more transparent accounting.\nMoreover, in the UK, listed companies are self-regulating in terms of disclosure\nof information on executive remuneration. In Germany, despite having a two-tier\nstructure, no details of the individual compensation package of any board member\nare published, but remuneration aggregates are publishable in the annual report.\nA further difference between the stakeholder model of corporate governance and\nthe shareholder model is that the stakeholder-oriented firm moves more slowly\nbecause of the numbers of stakeholders needing to be considered. In contrast the\nshareholder-based entity is more responsive to changes in market conditions\nbecause it is focused to be so and because of the versatility of top-down\nmanagement.\nYet both the shareholder and stakeholder approaches take account of the issues of\nboard checks and balances, abuse of authority and power, the role of boards, the\nrole and effectiveness of both executive and non-executive directors (external),\n55\nboard attributes, director rewards and participation in setting standards for\naccounting, safety, employee relations and risk management.\nIn today\u2019s business world, familiarity with the philosophy and characteristics of\nboth governance models and their board structures is necessary. International\ncompanies, operating from widely spread locations, need to respond positively to\ndifferent regulations, employee expectations and societal demands. Familiarity\nwith the contrasting demands of control in the two models is the first step to\nbecoming proficient at integrating shareholder and stakeholder requirements. For\nexample, it may be easier to import a stakeholder model of governance into a\nshareholder model environment than the other way around because of the\nexpectations of equity and control. The shareholder model encourages a top-\ndown, command-and-control leadership approach, whereas in the stakeholder\nmodel a team-based, shared-decision-making, servant-leadership approach is\nmore likely, with stakeholders\u2019 views being taken into account. Senior executive\ndevelopment needs to deal with the global governance challenges facing senior\nmanagers as much as other leadership issues. However, what is wanted is not only\nan understanding of the differences between the two models but, perhaps more\nimportantly, the capability to change leadership style in order to cope with the\ndifferent demands.\n56\n2.5.3 Corporate social responsibility\nAnother aspect of corporate governance that needs examination in terms of its\nimpact on the performance requirements of senior managers, and hence the\nimplications for executive development, is corporate social responsibility.\nNotwithstanding the neo-classical view that \u201cfew trends would so thoroughly\nundermine the very foundations of our free society as the acceptance by corporate\nofficials of a social responsibility, other than to make as much money for their\nshareholders as they possibly can\u201d (Friedman, 1962: 133), there are two further\nalternative views worth considering.\nThe first is a moral approach linked to social expectations that regards the firm as\nconstrained by a moral or ethical imperative. The argument is that because\nbusinesses control resources and skills, part of their role is to help in tackling\nsocial problems. There is a quasi-moral obligation to be involved (Moir, 2001:\n17).\nThe second view maintains that it is in the enlightened self-interest of business to\naccept various forms of corporate social responsibility. Business benefits that\nmight accrue include enhanced reputation and greater employee retention. This\nview is expressed in a report by the World Business Council for Sustainable\nDevelopment on Corporate Social Responsibility (WBCSD, 1999). It is supported\nby a recent CCPA study in Australia of motivations by business for community\n57\ninvolvement, which finds that Australian business is experiencing a transition in\nexpectations of its social role (CCPA, 2000).\nWhatever the theory, a variety of stakeholders are voicing their concerns with\nmuch greater impact. Responding to market dynamics needs to be balanced\nagainst being held to account by powerful interest groups for the actions of the\nfirm. There is an increasing focus both by business on corporate social\nresponsibility and also by society on the actions of business (Moir, 2001: 17).\nCorporate social responsibility has become as important a strategic issue as\nbranding or the future positioning of the firm, and as such is now a critical\nconsideration for executive performance.\n58\n3. Executive Development: Types, Benefits and Current Approaches\nAfter examining the past, present and future issues likely to affect executive\ndevelopment, with particular reference to top team and board structure, leadership,\ngovernance and the nature of executive responsibilities, it is important to explore the\nvarious approaches to executive development.\nThe terminology of development can be confusing, and we attempt to clarify it here. In\naddition, we review the different approaches to development, such as individual and\ncollective approaches, ad hoc and unified approaches, and we look at how each of them\naffects business strategy. We also consider the perceived benefits and barriers.\nWe ask who determines what executive development should be undertaken; who provides\nexecutive development; and, perhaps more demandingly, how it is evaluated. This section\ndraws extensively on the case studies carried out for this research to explore current\npractice.\n3.1 Clarifying terms\nAlthough the literature tends to use the words \u201ctraining\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d\ninterchangeably, training and education are distinct concepts. Training is \u201cvocationally-\norientated education, or hands-on skill development where skills are developed through\npractice, which is guided by formal structured means\u201d (Woodall & Winstanley, 1998: 9).\n59\nEducation is concerned with extending or improving learning through taught courses such\nas MBAs or DBAs (Beardwell & Holden, 2001: 373).\nDevelopment is more commonly seen as the aggregate of both training and education.\nDevelopment of individuals, which occurs over time with maturity and understanding, is\na complex process that involves an accumulation of knowledge gained through training,\neducation, and work and life experiences.\nAlthough education and training take place at all levels of management, from trainee\nmanagers, through middle-level and upper-level managers, it is at the most senior or\nexecutive level that the term \u201cdevelopment\u201d becomes most pertinent. Development is the\nprocess of \u201cbecoming increasingly complex, more elaborated and differentiated, by\nvirtue of learning and maturation\u2026which opens up the potential for new ways of acting\nand responding to the environment\u201d (Beardwell & Holden, 2001: 279 \u2013 280). It has also\nbeen described as \u201ca complex process of professional and personal growth, of acquiring\nand increasing knowledge, experience and skills, and of enabling personal qualities to\nmature\u201d (Pierce, 2001: 96). The Institute of Directors defines director development as\n\u201cthe systematic maintenance, improvement and broadening of knowledge, experience and\nskills and the development of personal qualities helpful in the execution of the role as a\ndirector\u201d (Pierce, 2001: 90).\nAlthough few organisations have a formal process of development for directors (Pierce,\n2001: 107), one survey found that, in those that do, development activities are balanced\n60\nequally between formal and informal methods (Thomson, Storey, Mabey, Gray, Farmer\n& Thomson, 1997: 1). Certain organisations concentrate on short-term, job-oriented\ndevelopment, others on succession planning and shared responsibility for careers, which\nindicates a longer-term perspective. Short-termism in this context can be damaging to an\norganisation. It is not enough for an organisation to simply survive, that is, to be adaptive;\nit must also be generative, continually expanding its capacity to create its future.\nHowever, generative learning cannot thrive in an atmosphere of surviving short-term\nevents (Senge, 1990: 14). Eithne Wallis, National Director of the Probation Service for\nEngland and Wales, recognises this: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about personal development,\nmy view of it is that it is not an episode, this is a long-term thing.\u201d Likewise, Dianne\nThompson at Camelot understands the continuing nature of executive development: \u201cI\nthink you always have to be learning and I think it\u2019s tragic when you see managers who\nhave stopped.\u201d\n3.2 Planned and unplanned processes\nDevelopment may be carried out either through planned or unplanned processes and the\nprocesses themselves may be formal or informal. If development is undertaken on the job\nit tends to be referred to as planned, informal development. If it is undertaken off the job\nit is more likely to be described as planned, formal development. Eithne Wallis remarks:\n\u201cI see training as one element of development, not the totality of development. What you\nwant to do is build confidence. [\u2026] That\u2019s good for them and it\u2019s good for us.\u201d\n61\nThere is also unplanned development, which involves accidental learning that might\noccur when carrying out everyday tasks. Potentially, this type of accidental learning can\ntake place in the course of an executive\u2019s routine work, for example, when attending\nmeetings or social occasions or when engaged in foreign travel. Mumford (1997: 58 \u2013 65)\nhas categorised both unplanned and planned development into three types (see box).\nMumford\u2019s learning types\n\u2018Type 1\u2019, or accidental learning, is wholly unplanned. It is only if\nthe incidents are recounted later that it is realised that learning\nmay have taken place. The learning may not be sufficient for it to\nbe harnessed and used at a later date in other circumstances.\n\u2018Type 2\u2019 is planned, on-the-job learning, for example, coaching,\nmentoring, observing role models, special projects, job rotation,\nshadowing, secondment, action learning and networking. Rather\nthan, perhaps, learning from an experience after it has happened\nas in Type 1, Type 2 involves integrating learning and work\nbefore it happens so that both are given sufficient attention to be\nrecognisable as potential learning experiences. Real activities are\ngiven priority so that learning develops from them, not the other\nway round.\n62\n\u2018Type 3\u2019 would include, for example, full-time residential\nprogrammes offered by universities, short-course open\nprogrammes offered by consultants, universities or industry\nassociations and programmes designed specifically for and\nattended by a company\u2019s participants. Although often called in-\nhouse programmes, these may be conducted off-site or developed\nby an external consultant exclusively for the company. Learning\nmethods used in these types of development might include, for\nexample, lectures, seminars, guided reading, interactive videos,\nfilms, group discussion, case studies, business games, and role-\nplays. Development of the executive is the prime concern here,\nnot work activity. Participants are expected to apply the learning\nexperience to their work on their return.\nWhilst learning on the job affords an opportunity to work in a \u201creal life\u201d situation, there\nare drawbacks. The focus is sometimes on the work activity at the expense of learning.\nLearning on the job is unlikely, on its own, to fully equip an executive with the\nknowledge required to operate in the modern world. Learning will be limited to the\ncontext in which the person is operating, so experience will not extend beyond those\nboundaries. Such experience-based development methods have emerged as a significant\n63\nfactor in executive and leadership development (Vicere, 1998: 540). However, more\nwork is needed to determine how to capitalise on its impact.\nIn the meantime, the value of such accidental development is being recognised. Margaret\nAldred, Director General of Resources and Performance at the Home Office, emphasises\nthat: \u201cI spend quite a lot of my time teaching my team some of the tricks that I've learnt\nand transferring the skills, and getting them to think about things in a different\nperspective and to be more challenging. I am also very aware of how much I've learnt\nfrom watching other people operate and deducing why some people are more effective\nthan others.\u201d Executives at Camelot also recognise the large volume of activity at the\ninformal and unplanned end of the development spectrum but, as Dianne Thompson\npoints out: \u201cWhat I haven\u2019t sat down and done is a formalised development plan and I\nthink that's what we are missing.\u201d\n3.3 Developmental requirements at the top\nAs we saw earlier, top team and board members, such as the chairman, CEO, executive\nand non-executive directors, have different responsibilities and perform different\nfunctions and therefore require different capabilities, albeit with some overlap. The\nimplication is that their developmental requirements will be different but at times overlap.\nAlthough the chairman is ultimately responsible for developing the board, it is the CEO\nwho should draw up a personal development plan (PDP) for each executive director,\ntaking account of the director\u2019s specific needs and the appropriate methods for meeting\nthem. However, the Cranfield research team\u2019s experience and that of colleagues at the\nDeleted: will\n64\nCareers Research Forum, is that setting the right example for personal development,\nhappens too rarely. (Kakabadse et al, 2002; see also p.74 of this monograph.)\nAs far as newly appointed executive and non-executive directors are concerned, it is\nincreasingly being considered essential for them to undergo an induction process\ndesigned to help them to understand the nature of their role and their contribution within\na reasonably short period of time (Kakabadse, Ward, Korac-Kakabadse & Bowman,\n2002: 4 \u2013 7). Activities should include learning about how the company is managed, how\nit relates to its customers, suppliers and employees and how employees are organised and\nmotivated. At the same time, newly appointed directors require an induction by the\nchairman into the board\u2019s affairs, the style of the board, how issues are dealt with both\ninside and outside the boardroom and the way that reports and information are best\npresented. The newly appointed director should be acquainted with the company\u2019s\nhistory, policies and culture, as well as its strategic objectives and the main issues, both\npast and present, that have been occupying the board and what issues it is likely to face in\nthe future (Harper, 2000: 142).\nIn addition to their individual development, executive directors need to work collectively\non their development through a variety of routes. Hyde and Tate (1996: 4) suggest a\nvariety of methods (see box).\n65\nRoutes for Collective Development\nAway-days \u2013 often an overnight residential workshop, sometimes\nwith an external facilitator, to encourage discussion of such issues\nas the business plan, culture change and management style.\nSometimes known as breakthrough sessions, a well-designed off-\nsite meeting allows time for open debate that can lead to, for\nexample, transforming board dynamics or discovering flaws in the\nstrategy. It also allows for bonding with fellow directors and,\ngiven an open informal atmosphere, directors will be able to use\nthe time not only to scrutinise company strategy and challenge\nunderlying assumptions, but to stretch their thinking (Charan,\n1998: 55 \u2013 56).\nTop-level seminars at hosted by external expert bodies on issues\nsuch as strategic policy formation, visioning, and global economic\nand social trends.\nConstructive post-mortems on strategic and operational\nexperiences that have taken place within the business.\nCoaching by the CEO \u2013 aimed at improving teamwork amongst\nexecutive directors.\nDeleted: \u00b6\n\u00b6\n66\nCompiling a learning grid \u2013 whereby directors identify issues in\none or more colleague\u2019s area of responsibility about which they\nneed to learn more. The needs are recorded on a grid and shared\namong the directors. Learning can then be achieved by simple\ndiscussion together by, for example, work-shadowing, guided\nreading, or attending key meetings.\nIt is important to remember the distinction between individual and collective\ndevelopment. As Steve Thompson of Camelot says: \u201cI think the two things are quite\ndistinct. I\u2019d say each individual is probably very committed to their own development and\ntakes quite a lot of ownership and responsibility, on, say, technical knowledge in the\nbroadest sense of their specialisms and specialist areas, and will attend events, e.g.\ncompany events or conferences, workshops, different types of functions, meetings, etc.,\nexternally. In terms of collective development, I think we\u2019re just beginning to do that\nnow.\u201d\n3.4 Piecemeal versus unified approaches to development\nOrganisations often regard development as a separate and isolated process. This tends to\nlead to piecemeal approaches with characteristics similar to Mumford\u2019s Type 1 and Type\n3 development. Thus development is not linked to business strategy; and activities are\nunrelated and fail to reinforce each other, thereby reducing the potential for improving\norganisational effectiveness (Beardwell & Holden, 2001: 368 - 369). Also, development\n67\noften concerns itself with organisational needs rather than with the learning needs and\nobjectives of individuals, the outcome often being frustration and demotivation among\nthe participants (Doyle, 2000: 588).\nOrganisations, particularly smaller ones, might choose a piecemeal approach simply\nbecause of financial constraints. Or those responsible for development might not be\naware of the need to link it to business strategy (Beardwell & Holden, 2001: 380). A\nunified, \u201copen systems\u201d approach, on the other hand, sees development as an integral part\nof the organisational system. It is also linked to the \u201creality\u201d of work as in Mumford\u2019s\nType 2 development. This is because the development process influences, and is\ninfluenced by, internal and external pressures. These pressures shape the way in which\ndevelopment contributes to organisational effectiveness. An organisation adopting this\napproach is making a conscious effort to recognise, and respond to, future learning needs\nfor both the organisation and individuals (Beardwell & Holden, 1994: 385 \u2013 388).\n3.5 The benefits of, and barriers to, top team and board development\nAccording to Pierce (2001: 30), the key driving forces of director and board development\nare: the superior organisational performance and sharper competitive edge that are\nexpected to result, and the desire of directors to be more professional. Allied to this is the\nwish by directors and boards to comply with legal requirements, avoid scandals and meet\nstakeholder expectations. These drivers lead to individual improvement, board\nimprovement and organisational improvement.\n68\nPierce goes on to say that, unfortunately, little development is actually undertaken in\nmany organisations. Typical barriers include lack of time and money, development not\nbeing perceived as applicable personally or to the board or company, not being linked to\nother company systems, no-one driving the development agenda, and people neither\nrealising what is possible nor the consequences of doing nothing. Ultimately there is an\nelement of fear associated with training (Pierce, 2001: 51 \u2013 3).\nNeil Roden, Group Director of Human Resources at the Royal Bank of Scotland,\nmaintains that \u201cthere is that managerial law which is \u2018the higher up you go, the less I\nneed to know as I wouldn\u2019t be Head of my department if I needed to know anything and\nwasn\u2019t perfect\u2019.\u201d Steve Thompson of Camelot agrees: \u201cI\u2019m sure everybody lists the first\nobstacle as time. [\u2026]. Secondly, [\u2026] when you reach a certain level, your need for\ndevelopment goes away because you tend to be the person who spends a lot of their time\ncoaching and developing other people. [People] tend to make an assumption that if\nyou\u2019re there in that position, you don\u2019t need any development and actually the opposite is\ntrue.\u201d Priscilla Vacassin, Group HR Director at BAA, concurs: \u201cPeople who have\nserious strengths, like world-class strengths, have probably got world-class weaknesses\nas well.\u201d\nEithne Wallis, National Director of the Probation Service for England and Wales,\nmentions the trials of executive development: \u201cIt takes real hard work to cut through the\ndifferences and the potential conflicts and the fears and get it to work.\u201d\n69\nIn discussions with companies, championing the development agenda emerged as a key\nfactor. \u201cIt [development] is more reliant upon the ability of the leader in an area to be\nable to harness the understanding and the emotion of the team and to provide meaning\nsuch that the context is clear\u201d (Tony Douglas, Group Technical Director, BAA). As\nTony points out, though, even in a positive environment it is still possible to find people\nsaying: \u201cThat is fine for somebody else, I never thought that it meant me!\u201d Tony goes on\nto argue that leading the development agenda involves \u201cconverting good intention to\nreality\u201d and \u201chaving a vocabulary and an understanding coupled with a passion and an\nenergy and an enthusiasm to bring it together.\u201d\n3.6 Determining executive development in practice\nSteve Thompson, Director of HR and Social Responsibility at Camelot, recognises that\n\u201cit\u2019s my responsibility to keep my knowledge and skills up-to-date and I think that would\nbe true of anybody at Board level.\u201d The same point is made strongly by Deborah Loudon,\nDirector of Personnel at the Home Office: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect to be spoon-fed; you've got\nto think about where you want to be, what you think you're best at, what you can\ncontribute.\u201d \u201cIn order to convert my potential, I need to be very clever in the way in\nwhich I support that with appropriate development\u201d (Tony Douglas, Group Technical\nDirector at BAA).\nYet where the onus lies on the individual to take responsibility for their own development\nthere can be a lack of clarity, as Eithne Wallis, National Director of the Probation Service\n70\nfor England and Wales, points out: \u201cI don\u2019t have that comfort zone of a really knowing\nwhat\u2019s expected of me. So it\u2019s hard, and I feel I have to take the initiative myself; there is\nnobody looking after my interests.\u201d Similarly, Deborah Loudon has noticed that \u201ca lot of\nsenior people are saying 'I want to be a better leader but I don\u2019t know how to do it\u2019.\u201d\nThe key to identifying needs, and meeting them, is to involve the executives themselves\nin the design and review of any development programme that is to be introduced. \u201cIt\n[leadership development] really has to be designed with them to be as responsive as you\ncan make it to their needs\u201d (Eithne Wallis, Probation Service). If everyone understands\nthe system and feels that they can work within it to their own benefit and to the benefit of\nthe organisation as a whole, then there is more chance that people will make use of the\ndevelopment opportunities available to them and encourage others to do the same.\n3.7 Delivering executive development in practice\nOnce the development needs of executives and the organisation have been identified, the\nnext step is to determine how best to meet them. Development does not just have to\nconsist of Type 3 activities, i.e. formal training courses, as Margaret Aldred, Director\nGeneral of Resources and Performance at the Home Office, reminds us: \u201cThere is a view\nthat you can\u2019t do something unless you've had a course. People need to find out that they\ncan learn things on the job.\u201d Deborah Loudon, also at the Home Office, makes the same\npoint: \u201cIn any big organisation you need a full range [of methods] because individuals\nrespond in different ways at different times.\u201d Neil Roden, Group Director of Human\nResources at the Royal Bank of Scotland, emphasises that \u201cwe try to tailor development\n71\nto what people want and what they feel comfortable with, because you can\u2019t force people\nto learn anything, so you have to find a way to do something that they and you want.\u201d At\nCamelot the view is that \u201coften, the higher up you go, it\u2019s the individual things that you\ncan do that seem to make the difference rather than some sort of sheep-dip type generic\ntraining activity\u201d (Steve Thompson).\nThe skills, knowledge and experience that senior managers have developed over their\ncareer are vital resources for developing their peers and their successors. The challenge is\nto provide the opportunity to let others take advantage of such learning. Developing\nothers in a team below is an important aspect to the individual development of the senior\nmanager.\nThis type of experience does not have to be organised as formal mentoring or coaching.\nThe conscious alliance of particular individuals with other people from whom they can\nlearn or to whom they can pass on their skills in the form of project or team work can be\na significant development opportunity. Indeed, this can form the basis of a policy for\nexecutive development. In a previous position, Margaret Aldred notes: \u201cIt was accepted\nthat you did most of your learning by being put in a place where you would learn,\nworking for people from whom you would learn.\u201d\nUltimately, the senior managers responsible for executive development need to ascertain\nwhat is best for their organisation and their people. Priscilla Vacassin at BAA points out\nthat \u201cwe make better leaders by getting them to understand the business.\u201d\n72\nIf we look at what external providers can offer organisations we find that in the past\nuniversity programmes were aimed at developing individual executives so as to support\norganisational goals (Bolt, 1993: 46). Today, organisations are turning to executive\ndevelopment to help change the whole organisation and its culture through managers who\nwill bring about such change (O\u2019Reilly, 1993: 53). Their ultimate goal is to improve\ncompetitiveness and to design new strategies and new ways of thinking (Bolt, 1993: 46 \u2013\n47; Vicere & Graham, 1990: 281). Universities and colleges, such as Cranfield School of\nManagement, Insead, Ashridge, Henley and London Business School, all offer senior\nexecutive programmes in the UK. Similarly, professional bodies offer development\nactivities to their members in the form of formal courses and more informal networking\nevents and conferences.\nOne of the themes that recurred throughout the case study interviews was self-awareness\nas a key capability of top team and board members. For example, BAA and a senior\nmanager who wished to remain anonymous both embody this principle in their leadership\ncompetency models. \u201cThe approach that we took is that they need to think about\nthemselves first. Not because they\u2019re better but because if they don\u2019t, why should they\nexpect anybody else to?\u201d\n3.8 Evaluating executive development in practice\nWhen the development needs of individuals, teams and the organisation have been\ndetermined and provided for, the extent to which these needs have been met must be\n73\nmonitored. Development evaluation has been, and continues to remain, an essential but\ncomplex task. \u201cTracking through a proper assessment of people's needs and then to a\nproper evaluation of whether they felt it met the needs is one of the hardest things of all\nfor any developmental tool. I've never seen an organisation that's managed that in a\ntotally systematic way\u201d (Deborah Loudon, Director of Personnel at the Home Office).\nEqually, the evaluation of the board and top team itself has become a prominent activity,\nincreasing the pressure on executives to ensure that they and their organisation are\nperforming well. In 1997 a survey commissioned by Russell Reynolds Associates found\nthat evaluation of a company\u2019s board has become an important factor for organisational\ninvestors, the assumption being that a good board of directors produces good corporate\ngovernance that delivers higher profits. Directors themselves confirmed that after board\nevaluations were initiated \u201ctheir meetings went more smoothly, they got better\ninformation, they acquired greater influence, and they paid more attention to long-term\ncorporate strategy\u201d (Conger, Finegold & Lawler, 1998: 136).\nHowever, despite compelling reasons to evaluate boards, a survey of directors of Fortune\n1000 companies, conducted in 1996 by Korn\/Ferry International, found that even though\napproximately 70 per cent had a formal process for evaluating their CEO, only a quarter\nof US organisations evaluated their board\u2019s performance. Evaluations of directors are\neven more rare (Conger et al, 1998: 136).\n74\nThe emerging consensus is that boards as a whole should regularly assess their\nperformance, and also that of individual directors, in order to create competitive\nadvantage and add value to the organisation (Charan, 1998: 151). An individual director\u2019s\nperformance should be monitored and appraised on an annual basis by the CEO to allow\nany development needs to be identified. However, a survey of 350 directors carried out\nby the Industrial Society in 1996 found that methods of assessing directors varied greatly.\nIn approximately 60 per cent of the organisations surveyed, director appraisals were\nundertaken by the CEO. Of these, 34 per cent said that appraisal was formal, while 27 per\ncent said it was informal. The number of executive directors appraising their colleagues\nwas 23 per cent, and 18 per cent said this was done informally.\nUltimately, it is the responsibility of each director to ensure that his or her skills and\nknowledge are kept up to date so that their expertise is constantly relevant to the\norganisation. In the current climate of change, a clear view emerging from the interviews\nis that directors need to continually and systematically add to their knowledge and\nexpertise in a way that will enhance the prosperity of the business (Pierce, 2001: 207 \u2013\n208). Margaret Aldred, Director General of Resources and Performance at the Home\nOffice, believes that \u201cdevelopment has a huge role to play, because what I found in my\nprevious career is that people who are successful know where they want to get to and\nthey know what it looks like and they can see ways to get there.\u201d\nDevelopment activity has generally been measured by the frequency of participation, for\nexample, the number of days or hours spent in development and the number of activities,\n75\nor the breadth of participation, for example, the diversity of activity. However, the \u201cHow\nmany?\u201d \/ \u201cHow much?\u201d approach is not completely reliable because not all development\ncan be measured. Margaret Aldred, Director General of Resources and Performance at\nthe Home Office, realises that \u201cyou can see it when it\u2019s working but it's quite difficult to\nquantify.\u201d And Priscilla Vacassin, Group HR Director at BAA, observes that \u201cThe\nmeasurement systems have to be designed into the business from the start and they can\u2019t\njust arise out of nothing. Most competency frameworks for example are not designed to\nmeasure competency, therefore measuring is impossible.\u201d\nSome organisations have begun to underline the importance of alternative forms of\ndevelopment, for example, shadowing or Internet access, instead of the more formal\ndevelopment activities that are separated from daily work. Organisations are also starting\nto look at the benefits of development in such areas as staff retention, knowledge creation\nand sharing, and growing their own effective group of leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s about having people\nwho are motivated; you need people to feel that they are achieving something in areas\nwhere there isn\u2019t a bottom line. [\u2026] Are they working for people they respect, are they\ndoing the job that they think has value, do they think that individually they are adding\nvalue, do they think that they are developing their potential and doing something which\ngives them self-satisfaction?\u201d (Margaret Aldred). Further, Dianne Thompson at Camelot\nbelieves you can measure the softer side of development: \u201cThe qualitative level really is\nknowing how motivated my guys are and because I spend quite a lot of time with them, I\nknow how they\u2019re feeling. I care very much about my people as individuals.\u201d\n76\nSuch forms of development are particularly difficult to measure. With the leadership\ncompetency model at BAA, Priscilla Vacassin accepts that \u201cthere is danger here because\nwe have genuinely tried to design it holistically - one thing is linked to another - and so\nyou will not be able to unpick it and say that benefit is linked to that, and that input is\nlinked to that.\u201d\nFinally, it does not matter how much \u201cdevelopment\u201d an individual experiences if the\nquality was poor, or it was irrelevant to their job or unrelated to their needs. An emerging\nview is that greater attention must be paid to the quality of development opportunities\n(Birdi, Allan & Warr, 1997: 856). Development is a benefit, and organisations must learn\nto capitalise on whatever investment they have made. \u201cIf you don\u2019t bring people together\nand don\u2019t invest, the effect is not neutral\u201d (Eithne Wallis, National Director of the\nProbation Service for England and Wales).\nPerhaps a suitable closing comment on evaluation can be taken from Neil Roden at the\nRoyal Bank of Scotland: \u201cThere are lots of things in life you can\u2019t prove so this is one of\nthose things you believe in. [\u2026] Nobody's cracked training and evaluation but when we\nhave, we'll patent it and make a few bob!\u201d\n77\n4. Organisational Case Studies\nWe have now examined the various perspectives found in the literature on executive\ndevelopment. This chapter sets out to provide insights into how strategic particular\norganisations are in their approach to executive development at senior management\nlevels. Six case studies are presented plus an additional study of the external analyst\u2019s\nperspective on top team and board performance. In all, eight organisations participated in\nthe survey. Two declined to make public their findings.\nThe companies that agreed to make public the findings from case study analysis are as\nfollows.\nBAA plc Owns and operates airports in the UK and elsewhere around\nthe world.\nThe BBC The UK\u2019s broadcaster of television and radio.\nCamelot Operator of the UK National Lottery.\nHome Office Aiming to build a \"safe, just and tolerant society\" through the\nwork of its executive agencies, inspectorates and non-\ndepartmental public bodies responsible for internal matters in\nEngland and Wales.\nThe Royal Bank of\nScotland plc\nThe second largest bank in the UK and Europe.\nRoyal & Sun Alliance One of the world\u2019s largest multinational insurance groups,\nselling a wide range of products that fall into two broad\ngroups: insurance for business and products for individuals.\nDeleted: take part in this study\nare\n78\nThe purpose of the case studies was to determine to what extent executive development\nsupports corporate strategy in each of the organisations. From the literature and the\ninterviews, seven initial strategic considerations for executive development were\nidentified: value creation, differentiation, risk management, governance and corporate\nsocial responsibility (CSR), extent and breadth of executive development activity,\nperspective to be adopted and whether to use an executive or management development\napproach. The case study evaluations relate to these considerations, identifying what is\ncurrently being achieved, and what still needs to be achieved, at individual, team and\norganisation level. This was achieved by exploring the following questions for each\norganisation:\n\uf0a7 Is the appropriate business language being used at top team and board level when\ntalking about executive development, i.e. the language of value, differentiation,\ngovernance, leadership and risk management?\n\uf0a7 Does the organisation appear to intend developing their top team and boards in those\nareas important to the current and future performance of the enterprise?\n\uf0a7 Is there evidence that the organisation is aware of concerns such as appropriate\nbusiness language and linking individual, top team and board development to the\nperformance of the organisation when discussing executive development?\n\uf0a7 To what extent have the organisations concerned declared responsibility for\ndevelopment in those areas important to their future?\n79\nThroughout this study it has been argued that successful senior managers require a\nparticular balance of skills, competencies and capabilities at any given time in any given\ncontext. Taking each of the seven strategic considerations in turn, we can see how this\nbalance may be achieved. For example, value creation at the operational level calls for\nskills to do a better job. Adding value at the strategic level demands competencies\nrelevant to the situation, for example, how to recruit the right people and develop better\ncustomer service. Value creation at the executive level requires vision to enhance\nstrategic capabilities and attend to the varied demands of shareholders and other\nstakeholders.\nSimilarly, differentiation requires the skills, competencies and capabilities needed to\nsufficiently differentiate the organisation in a competitive market. Risk involves ensuring\nthat executives can cope with uncertainty in the environment and manage it to the benefit\nof the organisation, in effect taking risks for maximum organisational gain. Governance\nand corporate social responsibility are issues that have received considerable attention in\nthe preceding sections, and refer specifically to the way in which an organisation is\ndesigned, and the capability of executives to work effectively within these structures. The\nextent of executive development activity, including commitment at the most senior levels,\nmeans that there may be more or less pressure on individuals to manage their own\ndevelopment or that of their colleagues. Achieving a corporate focus rather a functional\nfocus, particularly at the executive level, is a serious challenge for many organisations as\nwe have already discussed. Finally, concentrating on executive rather than management\n80\ndevelopment is often the key to achieving the desired organisational and individual\noutcomes.\nThe evaluation grid proposed in Figure 4.0 shows the vertical columns differentiating\nbetween four considerations that reflect orientation and sensitivity towards executive\ndevelopment: language, intention, awareness and responsibility. The horizontal rows\ncategorise the strategic issues which should be driving executive development in\norganisations.\n81\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue creation\nDifferentiation of\norganisation in\nmarket\nRisk management\nGovernance and\nCSR\nExecutive\ndevelopment\nactivity\nCorporate rather\nthan functional\nperspective\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather\nthan management\ndevelopment\napproach\nFigure 4.0 Evaluating Executive Development\n82\nBased on the evidence available from the interviews, this grid has been used to analyse\nthe extent to which the six case study organisations have harnessed executive\ndevelopment to particular corporate strategies. Owing to the limitations of time, complete\nevidence of all aspects in each organisation may not have been gathered. In fact, had\nother individuals in the organisation been interviewed, contrasting viewpoints may have\nemerged. Therefore, the evaluations made are not conclusive but indications of pockets of\nthought within the corporations.\nThe additional case study at the end of this section was compiled from four different\nperspectives designed to gain an insight into how top teams and boards are assessed\nexternally. Those interviewed were: a financial correspondent, a non-executive director,\nan executive search consultant, and a talent management consultant (see Appendix for\nfurther details).\n83\n4.1 BAA plc\nBAA owns and operates seven airports in the UK, and has management contracts or\nstakes in eleven airports elsewhere around the world. In total, the airports serve about 200\nmillion passengers. Stakeholder impact is an important issue for the company, which has\nboth a social and environmental guardianship responsibility as well as a commercial\nresponsibility.\nThe top management structure includes the board of directors, which is legally\nresponsible for running the company on behalf of shareholders. The board comprises a\nnon-executive chairman and six executive and five non-executive directors.\nThe top team, the Executive Committee, develops and recommends business objectives\nand strategies to the board. In addition, it reviews the company's performance and ensures\nthe delivery of agreed business objectives and plans. It is chaired by the Group Chief\nExecutive, Mike Hodgkinson, and includes nine other executive directors. At the moment\nthere is also a Deputy Group Chief Executive who is the Group Chief Executive's\nsuccessor. Below that structure, a subsidiary board presides over every airport or\nbusiness, headed by a Managing Director.\nAdditionally, BAA executive directors can be non-executive members of other BAA\nboards; an experience recognised as contributing to the development of the individual. It\nis considered that non-executive directors have an important function to play in how the\nboard and the Executive Committee operate. Governance is regarded as the responsibility\n84\nof the non-executive directors. Further, the non-executive directors ensure that there are\nplans in place to resource the Executive, and in so doing pay attention to the strategy for\nsenior management development. The chairman acts as an assessor of board\neffectiveness, a challenger and mentor to the Group Chief Executive, a commentator on\nthe external positioning of the organisation, and a monitor of the process and content of\ncorporate strategy development.\nApproach to development\nLeadership development is firmly on the agenda at BAA. The company is aiming to\nprepare managers throughout the organisation for the challenges they can expect at senior\nlevel by using the same methods, concepts and tools at all levels of management, but\nvarying their degree of intensity. For example, a one-day workshop may suffice at one\nlevel, whereas personalised coaching may be necessary for the same topic at a higher\nlevel. Although there is no formal policy for executive development, there is a Learning\nand Development Review Group, a subcommittee of the Executive Committee, which\nconsiders these issues.\nEach year, Human Resources advisers examine the business plan in order to convert it\ninto a performance plan, relevant for people in the organisation. The emerging views feed\ninto a workshop session where the business plan is considered in terms of leadership\nrequirements, with particular attention to the development of each individual senior\nexecutive.\n85\nThe competencies valued throughout the organisation are insight and self-awareness, and\na capacity to learn quickly. These primary competencies are supported by a matrix of\nleadership behavioural competencies based on four constructive leadership meta-\ncompetencies (that might be termed capabilities): to be courageous, to be curious, to\nprovide meaning and to enable others. These are linked to a broad competency dictionary\noffering considerable flexibility for differing roles and approaches to leadership. Roles at\nthe executive director level are characterised as 10% technical specialism and 90%\nleadership.\nThe leadership matrix is seen as a way of providing a consistent approach to development\nacross business units. It is supported by an Organisational Climate Inventory (OCI) tool,\nwhich links closely with the work on leadership. The intersections of the matrix\ndetermine 360\uf0b0 feedback questions, and hence form a means of evaluation. The tools and\nlanguage of this approach are gradually being spread throughout the organisation.\nA large number of the long stayers in BAA see these changes as a major culture shift. It is\nalso recognised that it will take time for the whole organisation to adopt the spirit and\nword of leadership development initiatives.\nIdentifying development needs\nMany methods are used at executive level to explore development needs, including\npsychometrics, biographical interviews and the \u201cCareer Path Appreciation\u201d (CPA) tool,\nparticularly exploring an individual\u2019s drive and potential, which is then related back to\n86\nbusiness needs. The leadership matrix model allows identification of priorities for roles\nand of strengths and weaknesses, and a gap analysis of development needs.\nPriorities for personal development usually emerge from the succession plan. People who\nhave the potential to serve on the Executive Committee are provided with suitable\npersonal development within an appointed time. The content is geared to the individual,\nwith up to ten people per year going through this process with the assistance of a personal\nfacilitator. The facilitators have been trained to build a dialogue between the business and\nthe individual. It is made clear to individuals that the process belongs to them, and that\nthe facilitators are there to support and not to assess. The process leads to a personal\ndevelopment plan for the individual drafted jointly by the person concerned and the\nfacilitator.\nBAA acknowledges that currently the climate within the organisation is perhaps not yet\nwhat senior management would like, being predominantly an avoidance culture in which\ndifficult issues are not tackled for fear of upsetting colleagues. The aim is however to\nbuild a climate in which feedback is the norm in order to create an open and responsive\nenvironment. There is also an element of apprehension among some executive level\nmembers, which is considered to result in a degree of intransigence, as the leadership\ndevelopment process can be quite intrusive and personal. Because BAA has been\noperating successfully, and safely, for a significant period, there is in some areas the\nfeeling that there is no need for change.\n87\nMeeting development needs\nVarious methods of meeting development needs at the executive level are used,\ndepending on how best to match the individual and business needs. For example, it may\ninvolve changing roles or teams, or introducing a coach or mentor. BAA also has a virtual\nuniversity, the \u2018Uni\u2019, that looks after all the learning aids. There are three executive\ndirectors on its Council, showing the commitment from the top levels to the initiative.\nEvaluating development\nDevelopment is regarded by BAA as a means of making an internal investment in the\nfuture of the company. Business cases for development are compiled in terms of outputs\nand outcomes from the start, giving a clear guide against which activities can be\nmeasured. The company believes that once it starts to build a better understanding of how\nthe organisational climate and leadership performance are changing, it will be able to\ncorrelate that with business performance. A framework has been constructed that now\nneeds specific measurements built into it.\nThe evaluation process is seen as a development process in its own right, as it involves\nasking directors to analyse the business and individuals, including themselves. Changes\nin behaviour and performance are not expected in the short-term. It is recognised that\nmeasurement has to be carried out over a longer period of time in order to determine\nbehavioural and culture shifts. Likewise, the business of BAA is long-term and does not\ndemand quick commercial results, which allows for longer-term development planning.\n88\nFigure 4.1 BAA plc Evaluation Grid\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nDifferentiation\nRisk\n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nGovernance\n\uf0fc \uf0fc\nSocial responsibility\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nExecutive development\nactivity \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nCorporate rather than\noperational focus \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather than\nmanagement\ndevelopment\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nKey:\n\uf0fc Limited evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Reasonable evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Clearly evident in development-related activities\n89\n4.2 BBC\nIntroduction\nThe BBC is a Corporation established under successive Royal Charters. Its current\nCharter runs to December 2006 and it sets out its public obligations. BBC services are\nregulated by a separate Agreement under the Charter, which recognises the BBC\u2019s\neditorial independence. The Corporation receives most of its income from the UK\nlicence Fee.\nThe BBC has a Board of twelve Governors who ensure that the BBC fulfills its\nobligations. They are all appointed by the Queen in Council. The Board of Governors,\nwho are men and women with a wide range of experience and interests in public service\nand the arts, business and industry, sets objectives and monitors the BBC\u2019s performance\nand standards against them. They also appoint the Director-General and senior\nmanagement team. All members of the Board of Governors have come from outside the\norganisation.\nThe Board of Governors are all part-time non-executives. They meet monthly and hold\nBBC managers to account for their performance against the agreed strategy and\nobjectives. The Governors ensure that the BBC :\n\uf0a7 is directed and managed in the public interest and accountable to licence payers\nand Parliament\n\uf0a7 complies with its Charter, Agreement and other regulations\n90\n\uf0a7 complies with the law\n\uf0a7 maintains the high standards and values expected of the BBC as the nation\u2019s\nbroadcaster\nThe Executive Committee is made up of the Director-General, who is both chief\nexecutive and editor-in-chief. He is appointed by the Governors, and leads a team of 18\ndirectors. The executive committee\u2019s role is to determine strategic direction, secure the\nresources required to get there and to be accountable for the performance of the whole\norganisation.\nApproach to executive development\nThe BBC\u2019s policy on executive development has changed over time. Ten or fifteen years\nago there was no development at executive level. As more people have joined the\norganisation from outside, they have brought different kinds of processes, one of which is\npersonal development, so things have changed. Currently, senior positions on the\nexecutive committee are filled by a mixture of external recruitment and internal\nsuccession planning. Those internal senior managers who are identified as possible\nsuccessors tend to receive greater focus and have more money spent on them than those\npeople who are not identified as possible successors. Although skills and competencies\nfor executives are not particularly well-articulated within the BBC, it is believed that\nexecutives will display evidence of the following:\n91\nConfidence\nIntelligence\nPolitical awareness\nAn engaging personality\nCreativity\nA sense of fun allied to high self-awareness\nDedication\nDiligence\nEnergy\nResolve\nThe ability to stick to a brief\nSocial confidence\nWorld class expertise in their sphere of influence\nThe BBC links executive development policy to business strategy in several ways. First,\npart of their strategy is to develop creativity in the organisation and that is done by\ninvesting in and developing people and giving them different kinds of experiences.\nSecond, part of their strategy is to send people out to their local communities in order to\npromote their understanding of the aspirations and interests of those communities. This\nhas the dual purpose of personal development whilst developing products and services.\nA new, integrated development programme is being established for the board and top\nteam. Some board and top team members undertake personal and collective development\n92\nand career planning and also act as role models and leaders for managers at other levels.\nPolicy is being developed around this issue. Any collective development tends to take\nplace off-site. For example, a group of executives has recently undertaken a series of\nvisits to the US, which was driven by a set of specific projects.\nOne appraisal system across the BBC is currently being established. Senior staff receive\nperformance related pay. The idea of a learning culture is not yet universal within the\nBBC, but it is a core aim.\nIdentifying needs\nIndividual development is driven by the executives themselves, whereas collective\ndevelopment is something that would either be driven by the Director-General, or it\nwould be driven by a particular project or projects that some of them are leading.\nDevelopment within the BBC it is driven by business needs, particularly at the top.\nMethods to meet needs\nSome executive committee members have personal coaches. They also attend and speak\nat conferences or read business magazines. A unique 4 day induction programme is\nguaranteed for all staff, but there are added extras at top team level. Occasionally, some\nindividual\/tutorial teaching takes place, as well as creativity sessions where executives\n93\nmight travel somewhere to look at how other people do something. The expected benefit\nis thought to be that they will perform better individually and collectively.\nThe contents of any executive development activity currently would be centred on\nbusiness ethics, change, leadership, strategy, performance and culture.\nIn terms of barriers to development, lack of time is cited as the biggest factor,\nEvaluation\nThere are an increasing number of sessions where executives work on a collective\nagenda together for team development purposes and they will then share experiences of\nfeedback through a facilitated process. 360-degree feedback is being introduced across\nthe organisation and evaluation metrics developed based around the Burke-Litwin model\n94\nFigure 4.2 BBC Evaluation Grid\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue\n\uf0fc\nDifferentiation\nRisk\nGovernance\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nSocial responsibility\n\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nExecutive development\nactivity \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\nCorporate rather than\noperational focus \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather than\nmanagement\ndevelopment\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\nKey:\n\uf0fc Limited evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Reasonable evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Clearly evident in development-related activities\n95\n4.3 Camelot\nCamelot is the operator of the UK National Lottery. It employs 930 staff who work from\na head office and ten regional centres across the UK. The objective of all staff is to\nmaximise revenue for \u201cGood Causes\u201d (arts, sport, charities, heritage, millennium projects\nand education, health and environment) and the government through lottery games in the\nmost efficient and socially responsible way. This involves creating, marketing and\npromoting new games, running and developing the lottery infrastructure, providing\nservices for players and winners and working in partnership with retailers.\nCamelot is a private company, wholly owned by five shareholders: Cadbury Schweppes\nplc, Consignia Enterprises Ltd, De La Rue Holdings plc, Fujitsu Services Ltd and Thales\nElectronics, who each hold a 20% stake in the company. Its board comprises a non-\nexecutive chairman, two non-executive directors, five executive directors and\nrepresentatives from each of its shareholder companies. Dianne Thompson leads an\nexecutive team of four directors.\nAs well as its financial obligations, Camelot\u2019s Social and Ethical Audit and its Social\nReport are an important part of Camelot Group plc\u2019s development as a company. The\naudit and the resulting report, first published in April 2000, forms a key element in\nCamelot\u2019s development as it seeks to fulfil its commitments as a private sector company\noperating what has become a public institution, The National Lottery.\n96\nThe Camelot Foundation is an independent charitable trust set up in 1996 and receives \u00a32\nmillion a year from Camelot Group plc. The Foundation is legally independent of\nCamelot Group and its policies are decided by an independent board of trustees. The\nFoundation aims to support initiatives that bring marginalized young people into the\nmainstream of UK life through its \u201cTransforming Lives\u201d programme.\nApproach to development\nCamelot has no specific company policy on executive development and although Dianne\nThompson, Camelot\u2019s CEO, is keen to create developmental opportunities for her\nexecutive directors, executive development takes place on an informal, ad hoc basis.\nHowever, this is something that she is keen to address at the earliest opportunity.\nBecause Camelot is quite a flat organisation in terms of structure and hence affords little\nscope for upward advancement, the CEO encourages her executive directors to network\nextensively outside the business and also to attend senior training courses. For example,\none of her executive directors recently took part in one of the Cabinet Office Forums and\nthe Financial Directors\u2019 Forum, whilst others have attended relevant conferences. Part of\nthe development opportunity available to Camelot executive directors is broadening their\nexperience, increasing responsibility and increasing exposure to issues outside the\nbusiness by dealing with shareholders, suppliers, Government, the National Lottery\nCommission and the distributing bodies.\n97\nIdentifying development needs\nTwice a year the CEO meets with the HR Director to review top-line organisational\nstructure. This has resulted in formalised programmes for those directors and managers\nbelow board level.\nMeeting development needs\nBoth the CEO and executive directors spend time with their direct reports, both formally\nand informally. Every fortnight, the CEO holds a business-based meeting to \u201ccatch up\non\u201d issues. She also tries to spend time with them all individually, either socially or when\ntravelling to other meetings. These coaching sessions include talking to her top team\nabout how they are approaching their jobs, or issues they need to be thinking about in\nterms of coaching some of their own staff.\nConsiderable development takes place on the job, for example, building up new areas of\nexpertise and gaining experience outside the organisation. Executive directors are\nexpected to be committed to their own development and accept responsibility for the\nenhancement of their technical knowledge in their specialist areas. They also attend\nlottery events or conferences, workshops and different types of functions and meetings\nexternally.\nCollectively, the top team takes part in its own in-house-devised development, such as a\nperiod of away-days that comprises a formal agenda and incorporates team-building. A\n98\nleadership programme called \u201cWinning Ways\u201d based on trying to identify and develop\ndesired organisational behaviours has governed top team development more recently.\nSenior managers also take part in off-site development with an external provider of team-\nbuilding programmes.\nCamelot undertakes induction, competency building and appraisal at executive level.\nEvaluating development\nCamelot believes that their organisation is inquisitive and forward-looking, with a\ncreative approach to issues and openness to learning. For example, considerable time and\neffort are devoted to studying lotteries in other parts of the world. However, they do not\nyet feel that they have the necessary infrastructure for capturing learning and using it\neffectively.\nThe CEO evaluates the benefits of executive development qualitatively rather than\nquantitatively. The business is expected to achieve specific strategic objectives and, at the\nquantitative level, some evaluation of leadership capability is attempted through staff\nsurveys and 360\uf0b0 feedback. At the qualitative level, the CEO undertakes structured one-\nto-one meetings with each of her team and observes behavioural or professional skills\nimprovement.\n99\nFigure 4.3 Camelot Evaluation Grid\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue\n\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nDifferentiation\nRisk\nGovernance\n\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nSocial responsibility\n* * * *\nExecutive development\nactivity \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nCorporate rather than\noperational focus \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather than\nmanagement\ndevelopment\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\nKey:\n\uf0fc Limited evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Reasonable evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Clearly evident in development-related activities\n* Although social responsibility was not evident in development-related activities, it\nmay be seen from the case study that the organisation engages strongly in such\nactivity.\n100\n4.4 Home Office\nThe Home Office, and its executive agencies, inspectorates and non-departmental public\nbodies, is the government department responsible for internal affairs in England and\nWales. The purpose of the Home Office is to work with individuals and communities to\nbuild a safe, just and tolerant society enhancing opportunities for all and in which rights\nand responsibilities go hand in hand, and the protection and security of the public are\nmaintained and enhanced. The Home Office is a distinct arrangement of disparate units\nand agencies brought together under a single Department of State. Organisational identity\nis therefore a complex issue.\nFifteen executive and three non-executive directors serve on two top management boards:\nthe Group Executive Board (GEB) and the Departmental Executive Board (DEB). This\nconfiguration is the result of recent restructuring of a single management board by the\ncurrent Permanent Secretary, John Gieve; an initiative that reflects a new corporate vision\nbeing developed for the organisation.\nThe GEB is responsible for leading the Home Office Group, including its agencies, to\nensure that it fulfils the aims set by Ministers, builds its capability for the future, and\nmaintains high standards of propriety. The GEB is chaired by the Permanent Secretary\nand includes eight executive and two non-executive members covering the Home Office\nDirectorates and Units.\n101\nThe DEB is responsible for the organisation of the core Home Office and driving the\ncorporate change programme. Its chair is the Permanent Secretary and it has ten\nexecutive and one non-executive members including Directors and Director Generals of\nthe core Home Office departments.\nThe non-executive members of both Boards are new positions, introduced to provide an\noutside perspective and new expertise.\nApproach to development\nBecause of the recent change in structure, the roles of the members of the two Boards\nlack clarity, often relying on implicit ground rules. However, the required competencies\nof Directors are clearly set to Civil Service standards. There are also guidelines in the\nModernising Government White Paper of 1999 as to the kind of skills required by civil\nservants in the future, such as innovation, continuous improvement and commercial skills\nin a learning organisation environment. The key values of the Home Office include\ndiversity, teamworking, integrity, accountability and transparency of processes.\nEffective leadership is acknowledged as a key requirement of a high-performing\norganisation. However, people with strong skills in their area of specialism have\ntraditionally been more highly valued. Generic leadership and management skills are\nstarting to receive more attention, although there is no mandatory training for staff\nprogressing through the management grades. As the demands made on the organisation\nare changing, and more emphasis is being put on the delivery of public services, people\n102\nwill require greater flexibility and the ability to manage diversity. More than one set of\nskills and styles is valued in the new environment, although, as yet, the range has not\nbeen defined.\nDevelopment is perceived as contributing to both skills and confidence. The Home Office\nbelieves it is important to create time for personal development, particularly at senior\nlevels. The formal policy on training and development is currently being revised, but in\nthe past it has included recognising skills gaps as part of the business planning process,\nwhich are then used to set training and development priorities. It is a competency-led\nprocess. People are committed to development of the individual in the Home Office, but\nperhaps with what could be described as an over-reliance on training events in a culture\nwhere academic and intellectual skills are highly valued. Owing to the time constraints of\nsenior managers, formal development events are seen as a useful way of allocating time\nfor personal development. Top management believe in showing commitment to\ndevelopment events through personal appearances and support.\nInevitably there are variations in approaches to development that affect the extent to\nwhich programmes and policies have been implemented in the various directorates,\nagencies and units. For example, in the National Probation Service (NPS), a great deal of\nattention has been paid to leadership development. This has led to a clear definition of\nperformance standards and the obligation of the NPS to help people achieve them. The\ntwo-year leadership programme that has been organised includes a Leadership Forum for\ndiscussing development and business issues, a 360\uf0b0 appraisal system leading to personal\n103\ndevelopment plans, training course provision and action-learning sets. Some elements are\nfacilitated in-house, others by external providers.\nHow much development a person undertakes is a function of both the organisational\nsystems in place and the initiative of the individual and their line manager. One of the\ncurrent debates is about how to bring the standards in each operating area to an equal\nlevel across the whole of the Home Office.\nIdentifying development needs\nA 360\uf0b0 appraisal scheme based on leadership competencies is used throughout the Home\nOffice. It is the primary means whereby individuals identify their own development needs\nand draw up personal development plans. Individuals can also request development\nsupport. Career development is well structured within the Civil Service, with people\nexpected to move between roles at regular intervals as a key feature of personal\ndevelopment. There is a team of people responsible for helping with senior management\ncareer progression.\nOne important role of the appraisal scheme is to ensure that development needs for\ntomorrow as well as today are being identified. This leads to a focus on building generic\nskills as well as people\u2019s confidence, incorporating flexibility and adaptability into the\nsenior executives of the organisation. The barriers to development include working with\nexisting limited human, financial and time resources.\n104\nMeeting development needs\nInitiatives have included the use of external facilitators and the use of drama and\nsymbolism to deliver key development messages, such as diversity. Leadership is another\narea being explored, with the aim of showing senior management what the top of the\norganisation looks like from middle and junior levels. Performance management and\nproject management are other areas of training that have been introduced with strong\nsupport at board level.\nMentoring and coaching are most used at senior management levels to meet the needs of\nthe individual. Development for the board as a team is now receiving more attention.\nAlthough induction exists for non-executive directors, in contrast, little other than\nstructured visits are organised for newly appointed executive directors.\nA full range of Civil Service training courses is also available to directors, such as the\nTop Management Programme. The Home Office has also purchased an e-learning\npackage for developing leadership skills, seen as a cost-effective way of making the\ntraining available to a larger number of managers, including executives, across the\norganisation. Preferred methods of development include peer-facilitated group work or\nformal training courses, often run by the Civil Service College.\nEvaluating development\nThe benefits of development are evaluated for individual programmes, with the emphasis\non skill and competency development. The aim is that people return to the organisation\n105\nmotivated and with new tools and techniques to do their job. Specific measures for\nevaluation are regarded as suspect, with it being easier to discover when an organisation\nis not carrying out effective development needs analysis and development evaluation than\nwhen it is. The time and effort required to measure development outcomes is seen as\nexceeding the value of the process.\nIn the National Probation Service monitoring of effectiveness takes place both at the front\nend - are we delivering what we promised as part of the development policy? - and at the\nback end - is the taxpayer happy with the service we provide? The middle range of\nmeasures looking at how individuals and teams are developing at a more qualitative level\nis currently being explored.\nTwo of the key benefits of development at the most senior level are the networking\nopportunities and time for personal reflection. The 360\uf0b0 appraisal is one tool for showing\nhow a person\u2019s profile has shifted against performance targets.\nAlthough the Home Office is clearly aligned to a specific sector and is going through a\nprocess of change, many development issues and principles are perceived as being\ngeneric to all organisations.\n106\nFigure 4.4 Home Office Evaluation Grid\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue\n\uf0fc\nDifferentiation\nRisk\nGovernance\n\uf0fc\nSocial responsibility\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nExecutive development\nactivity \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nCorporate rather than\noperational focus \uf0fc\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather than\nmanagement\ndevelopment\nKey:\n\uf0fc Limited evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Reasonable evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Clearly evident in development-related activities\n107\n4.5 The Royal Bank of Scotland plc\nThe Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), founded in 1727, is the second largest bank in\nthe UK and Europe and ranks fifth in the world. In March 2000, RBS completed the\nacquisition of NatWest. The enlarged Group has a market capitalisation of \u00a349 billion as\nof 22 February 2002. It has more than 18 million UK personal customers and 2,287 UK\nbranches and employs over 105,000 staff worldwide.\nThe top management structure of RBS includes a board of directors, with the chairman\nleading six executive and thirteen non-executive directors. The Group executive\nmanagement committee, run by Fred Goodwin as Group Chief Executive, includes both\nthe business unit heads and functional heads; a total of nineteen members. The Group\nexecutive management committee and the Group Chief Executive run the day-to-day\nbusiness. The board attends to issues of guardianship, guidance, strategy and control.\nApproach to development\nThe structure of the senior levels of the bank is comparable to other organisations in the\nsector and, as such, roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. The competencies\nrequired are perhaps less generic, and rely more on personal interpretation and the\ndemands of the environment. The specific competencies currently valued include being\nable to adopt a questioning style of management, to assimilate and understand\ninformation, to understand the business, and each individual being able to understand his\nor her role in relation to the shareholders. The Group executive management committee\n108\nincludes a mixture of business and functional specialists, emphasising the different roles\nto be carried out.\nFor executive development the RBS uses a tool called the Leadership Excellence Profile\n(LEP), which has been developed over the last three years. The profile identifies what it\nis that leaders of the Group do that (a) makes them successful, (b) achieves results that\nare better than their competitors\u2019, and (c) differs in some way from the norm that you\nwould expect from a generic leadership model. The LEP is presented in three clusters of\ncompetencies, attributes and personal characteristics, and is used to assess senior\nmanagers and executives for selection and development.\nRBS invests time and resources in developing a learning culture, which is monitored\nthrough regular staff surveys. The company is keen on personal development throughout\nthe organisation with a group-wide policy to support this. Development is high on the\nGroup executive management committee\u2019s agenda with considerable investment in this\narea.\nIdentifying development needs\nDevelopment is regarded by most senior managers as a useful process. Individuals can\njoin corporate programmes on their own initiative or request specific individual support.\nIn identifying development needs at executive level less reliance is placed on appraisal\nschemes and more on individual initiative. The Human Resources department plays a role\nin helping individuals identify these needs.\n109\nThe barriers to development tend to be at the individual rather than organisational level,\nnotably in terms of self-awareness. This problem is being tackled through a Leadership\nDevelopment Workshop, which helps people compare themselves against the desired\nleadership model, and identify any gaps.\nMeeting development needs\nAn assessment centre is currently being piloted against the Leadership Excellence Profile,\nwhich will result in the refinement and further implementation of a Leadership\nExcellence Programme. RBS will look for high potentials against the LEP criteria\nthrough this programme. Coaching is used to help people at executive level to develop\nfurther.\nPast development activities in the RBS Group have varied between what was previously\nundertaken by RBS and separately by NatWest before the acquisition. The aim now is to\nrefine a model suitable for the new group as a whole.\nThe Leadership Development Workshop is a three-day assessment centre, facilitated by\nboth internal and external people. Many of the other formal development activities and\ntraining are outsourced to external providers.\n110\nEvaluating development\nDevelopment activities have to be seen to be contributing to the business, and measures\nsuch as return on investment, performance management and business results are reviewed\nover the short- and medium-term to assess this. For example, succession plans are one\nway of monitoring improvements in performance.\nA great deal of attention is also paid to the employee surveys that are carried out each\nyear to gauge the current organisational climate. The surveys are seen as a way of\nmeasuring management performance at all levels.\nThere is an underlying belief that development is good for the organisation, and not too\nmuch time is spent measuring its impact in any mechanical way as the effort involved is\nthought to outweigh the benefit. The benefits of development are regarded as coming\nfrom the ability to develop the skills within the company and to encourage internal\npromotion.\n111\nFigure 4.5 The Royal Bank of Scotland Evaluation Grid\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nDifferentiation\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nRisk\n\uf0fc\nGovernance\n\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\nSocial responsibility\n\uf0fc\nExecutive development\nactivity \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nCorporate rather than\noperational focus \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather than\nmanagement\ndevelopment\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nKey:\n\uf0fc Limited evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Reasonable evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Clearly evident in development-related activities\n112\n4.6 Royal & Sun Alliance\nRoyal & Sun Alliance (RSA) is one of the world\u2019s largest multinational insurance groups,\nwith operations in some fifty countries and the ability to transact business in over 130.\nThrough this international distribution network, they deliver financial solutions to over\ntwenty million clients around the world.\nThe RSA Group is organised into four distinct regions based on time zones - UK, EMEA\n(Europe, Middle East and Africa), the Americas, and Asia\/Pacific. They organise their\nbusiness in this way because they believe that their customers are best served by\nempowering people who understand local conditions and customer needs.\nIn all regions RSA sell a wide range of insurance and insurance-related products that fall\ninto two broad groupings. These are Commercial Insurances (insurance for businesses)\nand Personal Financial Services (products for individuals).\nThere have been some significant changes to the group board and management board\nduring the last four years. The group board comprises a non-executive chairman, Sir\nPatrick Gillam, an executive Group CEO, Bob Mendelsohn1, an executive Chief\nOperating Officer, Bob Gunn, and an executive Finance Director, Julian Hance, plus six\nnon-executive directors of diverse backgrounds, all of whom have been chosen for their\nparticular area of expertise.\n1 See update at the end of this section.\n113\nThe management board, located in the UK, has also undergone substantial change. It is\nnow an international mix of individuals and comprises five executives: the Group CEO,\nBob Mendelsohn, the COO, Bob Gunn, and the three CEOs of the UK, EMEA and\nAsia\/Pacific regions.\nAs a Group, RSA recognise their responsibility towards both individuals and the local\ncommunities in which they operate. Accordingly they have developed a number of\ninitiatives as well as partnerships with other organisations designed to make a positive\ncontribution in a variety of ways:\n\uf0b7 they encourage staff to play an active role in local charities or organisations;\n\uf0b7 they provide logistical support to other groups to allow them to operate more\neffectively;\n\uf0b7 they make financial contributions to global organisations such as the International\nFederation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\nRSA also sponsor the Rules of Golf, which date back to the beginning of the last century.\nThe Rules are published once every four years by the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St.\nAndrews.\nApproach to development\nThe traditional way of developing senior insurance executives had remained virtually\nunchanged for nearly three centuries. This involved looking foremost at technical\ncompetence in the various areas of insurance such as underwriting, claims, cost control\n114\nand engineering. People tended to spend their careers in a vertical silo with ever-\nincreasing realms of responsibility within a particular technical competence, so that some\nwould reach the top of the underwriting silo or the top of the claims silo, and then\nbecome a general manager.\nMore recently, as part of their evolving culture, the approach to development has been to\nattend more to a broad set of competencies, with a much more developed multi-task\nexperience for senior managers. RSA are looking for more diversity in the types of\nassignments, types of people and types of background. This means that, in addition to\npeople of different nationalities, the board now includes two women. RSA have also\ndiversified by age. They have ventured outside the world of financial services to bring in\npeople with expertise in electronics, as well as someone who is on the board specifically\nfor their marketing expertise and another for their operational expertise. They have\nsought non-executives who have added a particular quality to the board, rather than\nsimply being non-executives of stature. This relatively new approach has prompted a\nsearch for people with international experience, rather than simply outstanding\nunderwriters or marketers. RSA have tried to incorporate greater breadth into the team,\nand this has involved moving some members outside their comfort zone into different\nassignments in non-traditional areas.\n115\nIdentifying development needs\nRoyal & Sun Alliance see development as a joint initiative for both people at executive\nlevel, who are self-starters, and their managers, who put forward suggestions for\ndevelopment.\nMeeting development needs\nDevelopment takes place both on and off the job. This entails technical training outside\nthe normal area of competency and also an internal, on-line method called\nRSAlearning.com, although these levels of learning are not intended for senior people.\nOff-site, executive and technical management programmes are available and are used by\nboth senior people and those they think will hold senior positions in the future.\nAlthough there is no written policy for top team and board development, there is a well-\nestablished development programme designed to enable people to reach senior positions.\nBy the time managers are appointed to senior positions, they would have been through\nvarious UK and international business schools, such as Cranfield and CEDEP, in order to\ndevelop their managerial and leadership skills.\nOnce someone is appointed to management board level, the emphasis changes somewhat\nin that any future development tends to be specific to the person concerned. All\nindividuals develop media skills as they become more involved with the outside world.\nMost management board members also receive training in directorship responsibilities.\nIndividuals may decide to pursue training in trustee responsibility because they are likely\n116\nto become involved with trustee boards. Most senior executives receive training in legal\ncompliance requirements, such as anti-competitive behaviour and the requirements of a\nregulator. There is also the opportunity (though few take it) up) of having executive\ncoaching for individuals in their new role. There is no formal induction process for\npeople reaching management board level.\nAs well as undertaking appraisals at top team level, the management board in the UK\nholds a telephone conference call once a week for an hour. There is a day-long board\nmeeting once a month. They also have two away-days every quarter to enable the board\nmembers to share views, become better acquainted with each other and provide thinking\ntime on strategy.\nEvaluating development\nEvaluation tends to be of the \u201creaction\u201d kind that takes place after a course. In addition,\nthe management board carries out a certain amount of subjective evaluation of how\npeople are performing and developing in their role.\n117\nFigure 4.6 Royal & Sun Alliance Evaluation Grid\nEXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT\nLanguage Intention Awareness Responsibility\nValue\nDifferentiation\nRisk\nGovernance\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nSocial responsibility\nExecutive development\nactivity \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nCorporate rather than\noperational focus \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nST\nR\nA\nT\nE\nG\nY\nExecutive rather than\nmanagement\ndevelopment\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nKey:\n\uf0fc Limited evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Reasonable evidence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Clearly evident in development-related activities\n118\n4.7 A contrasting view: the external analyst\u2019s perspective\nAs a result of undertaking this study which focuses primarily on looking at organisations\nfrom the inside, the following questions regarding external perspectives emerged:\n\uf0a7 How are business and public service leaders viewed?\n\uf0a7 Are capabilities for achieving efficiency and profitability alone sufficient for meeting\nstakeholder needs today?\n\uf0a7 To what extent do leaders and their capabilities project the image of their organisation\nirrespective of its performance?\n\uf0a7 To what extent do stakeholders assess the effectiveness of the organisation by the\nperceived quality of its leadership?\nTo gain insight into these issues a further four people were interviewed - a journalist, a\nnon-executive director, an executive search consultant and a talent management\nconsultant. Details of the interviewees can be found in the Appendix.\nNils Pratley, Journalist\nFirstly we consider how information about an organisation is gathered and how useful\neach source is. Large companies issue, almost on a daily basis, press releases covering,\nfor example, take-over bids, interim results and final results to the London Stock\nExchange, which publishes them and sends them, electronically, to all newspapers. These\nreports, and especially the company\u2019s financial performance, are vital for investors and\ncompetitors.\n119\nPress conferences given by organisations tend to be staged events that are not always\nuseful sources of information. People at the top tend to undergo media training, as\norganisations are wary of volunteering sensitive information. Many executives see the\npress as a kind of danger, rather than something to communicate with openly. Media\ntraining can prevent top teams and boards from being seen as human beings, and those\nexecutives who tend to be arrogant with the press and the City receive no sympathy when\nthings go wrong with their organisation. Although media training is useful, it helps if\npeople show their human side. If people at the top don\u2019t generate goodwill and display a\nsense of humour, and are not seen to have a personality, then they will be regarded as\n\u201cjust another CEO, just another man in a suit, another middle-aged male who looks like\nany other chief executive.\u201d Women chief executives cause great excitement among the\npress because there are so few of them.\nFew top executives see themselves as public figures, which, Nils believes, they are\nnowadays because more information is in the public domain. This is particularly true of\nCEOs, who tend to be singled out by the press and reported on as the representative of an\norganisation.\nNon-executive directors can be helpful in giving information to the press because they\nhave a duty not just to the company but also to the shareholders, and their loyalty should\ngo beyond the CEO. He states that he would probably trust a story more if it came from a\nnon-executive director, partly because if something is wrong they tend to admit it sooner\nthan executive directors.\n120\nAs well as written sources of information and press conferences, journalists do rely on\n\u201cgut instinct\u201d when reporting on top teams and boards. Gut instinct, according to Nils,\ncomes into play when \u201csomeone is trying to sell you something too hard.\u201d For example,\nduring the dot.com boom, some companies were basing their stories on hypotheses that\nwere wildly optimistic, such as confidently explaining how their business was going to\nchange the world. But journalists saw through the rhetoric and recognised what lay\nbehind it \u2013 a high-risk strategy that in many cases led to disaster.\nThe journalist\u2019s advice to top teams and boards who seek attention from the press is to\nhave a personality. However, personality alone will not stop bad press if the company is\nperforming badly.\nJohn Merrell, Non-executive Director\nFrom a totally different perspective, John Merrell, at Data Junction UK, assesses\ncompanies within a context. He believes that it is important to know something about the\norganisations\u2019 differentiators, their leadership team as well as their balance sheet and\ntheir financial record.\nIf John is taking over a company, for example, he also relies on gut instinct, in addition to\nthe usual financial indicators. He asks why an organisation might want to sell and to\nwhom, and he also looks for good leadership. There is no set methodology to what he\ndoes, although it is important to have a common language. For example, he argues that a\n121\ncompany is a device for generating value. Therefore, he would ask what value the\ncompany purported to create and whether or not it would withstand scrutiny. He then\nanalyses the data, for example, the size of the market and what competitors there are,\nseeking validation of the market and whether there is a history. It is also important to\nknow about the record and reputation of any individual or team hoping to take the\nproduct or service to market. Talking to the company\u2019s customers and key business\npartners therefore in order to understand the relationships is important. There must be a\nsound marketing plan and the skills to implement it, to understand the business position\nin terms of money, partnerships or intellectual property. John comments that he has not\ntried to structure his approach because of the danger of neglecting the context. He tends\nto view things from a risk management point of view, asking what is the worst that could\nhappen, which means that his scrutiny has to be thorough.\nHilary Sears, Vice-president, Executive Search Consultant\nFor Hilary, it is important to understand what talent a company already has, as she is\nseeking to recruit talent to put into a company. The method tends to follow a prescribed\nset of steps. For example, once given an assignment she will undertake background\nresearch into the organisation and why a vacancy has arisen. The next stage is to have a\nbriefing meeting with the potential client to form an understanding of the role for which\nthey are recruiting and its priorities. She also needs to know how success in the role is\nevaluated, or how the individual filling the role will be evaluated, for example, the\ncompetencies and experience that are required. Understanding the role, why it has arisen,\nwhat the background is and whether the outgoing person has performed well, are key\n122\nissues at this stage. It is also important to understand the environment and the culture and,\ntherefore, the type of person who would fit the role. The next step is to clarify the\nrelevant job description by breaking it down by company background, the role itself and\nthe responsibilities, and then the ideal candidate profile.\nTargeting of potential candidates tends to start with their experience, rather than their\npersonal attributes, which are more difficult to establish, although the latter come to light\nduring the process. However, there are some standard attributes that organisations want,\nsuch as leadership skills, communication skills, ability in training and development and\nteamworking, which suggests a collaborative approach. Some companies, particularly in\nthe public sector, use psychometric testing to assess potential candidates.\nBy talking to opinion formers, journalists and other such people, a picture is built up of\npeople regarded as good performers in the market. Somebody might be seen as a good\nperformer either because they are good at promoting their own personal profile, or\nbecause of the performance of the company they work for. A direct approach is then\nmade by telephone, when screening against the criteria takes place.\nOne problem encountered in the search process is that it is not possible to take a client\u2019s\nproposal at face value. There might be instances when it is quickly realised that it is not\none job that needs to be filled but a different one. This leads the executive search\ncompany into the realms of management consultancy, and they often find themselves\nadvising a client that the need is not necessarily where the client thinks it is.\n123\nMark Byford, Talent Management Consultant\nMark is part of an organisation that specialises in assessing and recruiting top teams and\nworking with organisations to strengthen their boards. They provide a management\nappraisal service which provides their clients with an analysis of their management\nresources and helps them to develop and deploy these resources to the maximum\nadvantage.\nIn an attempt to gain an external perspective, companies carry out management appraisal\nfor many different reasons, such as mergers, a new CEO in post, internal or external\nbenchmarking as part of a talent audit, or for culture change programmes. The appraisals\nenable leaders to decide on appointments, to embark on longer-term strategies for\nindividual or team development, and, for example, to decide whether to complete an\nacquisition.\nThe first phase of an appraisal establishes the competencies that will be used to evaluate\nthe top team. These competencies are based on the strategic priorities and tactical\nobjectives of the business and incorporate any existing competency models being used.\nThe aim of evaluating senior executives is to predict the likely future performance of\neach executive as precisely as possible. Each executive is appraised on the basis of three\nmain sources of information. First, their academic and professional background; second,\na structured interview conducted by two consultants; third, a 360\uf0b0 reference-taking\n124\nexercise, including confidential discussions with superiors, peers, subordinates and,\noccasionally, external referees.\nThe results of the evaluation are presented in a report, which highlights any skill gaps and\ncritical competency issues. Providing feedback ensures that all individuals benefit from\nthe exercise and maximise the opportunity for their own professional development. An\neffective board composed of the right people, focusing on the right issues, and working in\nan environment of dialogue, not monologue, is a high-value corporate asset.\nSummary of external perspectives\nConsidering how each of the four external analysts gather information about the\norganisation for their different purposes, the key themes emerging from the interviews\ninclude:\n\uf0a7 Media presence\n\uf0a7 Personality of senior management\n\uf0a7 Background of senior management\n\uf0a7 Financial performance of organisation\n\uf0a7 Contribution of non-executive directors\n\uf0a7 Context analysis\n\uf0a7 Role analysis\n\uf0a7 Talent pool\n\uf0a7 Gut instinct\n\uf0a7 Appraisal\n125\nIn summary, what we can learn from this is that organisations need to be aware of\nmaintaining a constant media presence, and that journalists rely on gut instinct as well as\npublished financial data. From a journalist\u2019s perspective, an organisation\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer or equivalent largely creates its image in the press. However,\npersonality is not the whole story \u2013 financial performance is another key part of the\npicture painted in the media, and the contribution of non-executive directors is important\nin this area because of the duty they have to external stakeholders.\nSimilarly, those external analysts in the business of taking over, growing or developing\ncompanies, rely largely upon gut instinct. It is therefore important that the talent pool of\nthe organisation is seen to be shining through as well as personalities and sound financial\nperformance. When executive search consultants are seeking new talent, both the\norganisation and this talent pool are scrutinised. Research into the organisation, for\nexample, in terms of financial performance and culture, as well as role analysis for the\nposition being filled, plays an important part in the search process. Assessing the current\ntalent needs of an organisation involves exploring how the organisation is performing, but\nalso understanding the whole organisational context. Executive capability is known to\ninclude generic elements but is also highly context-specific.\nAn organisation\u2019s own evaluation of its capabilities and performance, with or without the\naid of external facilitators, is a prudent step to undertake in order to understand how the\noutside world sees it and how it is preparing itself for the future. Appraisal can help an\n126\norganisation evaluate and retain its own talent pool and understand its own potential\nperformance as well as those of competitors and potential mergers.\nThe following grid shows the degree of importance attached to these key themes by\nanalysts who study organisations from the outside.\n127\nFigure 4.7 External Analyst Evaluation Grid\nEXTERNAL ANALYST\nJournalist\nNon-\nexecutive\nDirector\nExecutive\nSearch\nConsultant\nTalent\nManagement\nConsultant\nMedia presence\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\nPersonality and\nbackground \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nFinancial\nperformance \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nContribution of\nnon-executive\ndirectors\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\nContext and role\nanalysis \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nTalent pool\n\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nGut instinct\n\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\nK\nE\nY\nT\nH\nE\nM\nE\nS\nAppraisal\n\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc \uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc\nKey:\n\uf0fc Not important\n\uf0fc\uf0fc Fairly important\n\uf0fc\uf0fc\uf0fc Very important\n128\nIt may be seen from the grid that research into an organisation and\/or analysis of the roles\nwithin a company are the most important issues to have emerged from this exercise. Top\nteams and boards need to be aware of, and prepare for, the scrutiny they are inevitably\ngoing to face, simply by being who they are, and what they are, within an organisation.\nThe organisation\u2019s financial performance, the personality of people and the mix of talent\nat the top of the organisation are also extremely important to outside opinion-formers, all\nof which are, of course, greatly influenced by executive development activity.\n129\nUpdate on Royal & Sun Alliance\nOn 12th September 2002, Royal & Sun Alliance announced that Bob Mendelsohn was\nstepping down with immediate effect as CEO. This follows a series of problems that have\noccurred during his five-year tenure, during which he has led the group through difficult\ntimes within the insurance industry (The Times Business, 13.9.02: 27). In August of this\nyear, RSA announced disappointing results and admitted it was short of capital. At the\nsame time, it cut 1200 jobs and closed its life office to new business. Two weeks later,\nthe organisation was fined \u00a31.3 million for pensions mis-selling (Financial Times,\n13.9.02: 1). RSA shares have collapsed from 808p to 120p during Mr Mendelsohn\u2019s\nperiod with the company and there may be more job losses to come with the jettisoning\nof unprofitable lines of business. Shareholders, who sought a change at the top, are\nthought to be demanding an external candidate as a replacement for Mr Mendelsohn (The\nTimes Business, 13.9.02: 27).\nThe recent events surrounding Royal & Sun Alliance have given us a poignant and timely\nreminder of the development issues that need to be taken into account at top team and\nboard level. Several statements from the main body of this work are re-iterated here in\norder to highlight the very real lessons that may be learned from this case study and the\nsubsequent actions that have been taken.\n\uf0a7 Some commentators believe that the board\u2019s most important function is to select the\nCEO. Board members need to be fully equipped to know what is required of a\nsuccessive leader when recruiting a CEO. Suggestions are given within the study.\n130\n\uf0a7 The organisation relies on both the chairman and CEO to demonstrate high levels of\ncapability in terms of leadership and governance. These capability requirements must\nbe understood and articulated before recruitment takes place.\n\uf0a7 Once a CEO has been recruited, top team development must contribute to ensuring\nthat the CEO is capable of leading the organisation into the future. In other words,\ndevelopment is still an issue, even for CEOs.\n\uf0a7 Corporate governance is a fundamental element of the corporate context and is\nspecific to the ethos of the organisation and the country in which it is based. It is\nessential that different cultural models of governance are understood and adjustments\nmade by those senior people moving into, or working within, the area of an\nunfamiliar model.\n\uf0a7 The CEO is the main point of accountability in the executive or management\ncommittee, but is reliant upon the performance of his or her top team to ensure\nsuccess for themselves and the organisation, both internally and from an external\nperspective. A quote from Bob Gunn, RSA\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, in The Times\n\u2018Business\u2019 section (13\/9\/02, p27) stated that the entire leadership team feels they have\nlet their CEO down because their performance was not as they would have hoped.\nThis raises questions of how a CEO assesses his or her top team and how much\nresponsibility he or she takes for the team\u2019s development.\n131\n\uf0a7 In this day and age, a CEO is likely to be the subject of public scrutiny. A poor\nreputation in terms of decision-making or style reported in the media could be so\nserious as to undermine investor confidence and, ultimately, affect share price.\n\uf0a7 One of the strategic issues driving top team and board development identified in this\nstudy was risk management, which is about ensuring that executives can cope with\nuncertainty in the environment and managing it to the benefit of the organisation,\ntaking appropriate risks for maximum organisational gain. This has been proven to be\na core capability requirement in this case.\n132\n5. An Integrative Model of Executive Development\nFollowing the analysis of the literature and interviews with case organisations and\nexternal analysts, this chapter summarises what can be learned and introduces a model of\nexecutive development for senior management.\nAs we have seen in the case studies in the previous chapter, the key themes with\nimplications for executive development that arise when talking to organisations include:\n\uf0a7 variations in approaches to executive development;\n\uf0a7 the influence of context;\n\uf0a7 the balance between the skills, competencies and capabilities required of senior\nexecutives;\n\uf0a7 self-awareness as a key capability;\n\uf0a7 corporate versus functional orientation of executive development policy;\n\uf0a7 management versus executive development activities;\n\uf0a7 the predominance of leadership and governance issues.\nOrganisations base their approach to executive development on the conditions of their\nenvironment: organisation context, corporate strategy, resources and the personalities\ninvolved (i.e. senior managers and members of the HR function). Key individuals drive\nforward the development agenda, be they the CEO, the HR Director or other executive\ndirectors, meeting the requirements of the particular enterprise. Context is crucial: generic\nexecutive skills and competencies exist, but executive capability involves putting these\nskills and competencies into action in a unique manner that adds value to the\norganisation.\n133\nThe model of executive development presented in Figure 5.1 illustrates the skills,\ncompetencies and capabilities required by executives to enable them to handle the\ndiversity of challenges they are inevitably going to face, both now and in the future.\nThe model shows the three work domains within organisations: operational, strategic and\nexecutive (top team and board level). At the operational level, managers will have\nacquired skills through specialised training and development, for example, foreign\nlanguages, media training and communication. Similarly, at the strategic level, they will\nhave acquired certain competencies, for example, in strategic analysis. At director level,\nthey will develop executive-level capabilities such as vision, leadership and the ability to\nsee the bigger picture.\nHowever, this is where executive development stops in most organisations, failing to\naddress the higher-order value-added capabilities which can create a direct link between\nexecutive development and achieving organisational priorities.\n134\nFigure 5.1 The skills, competencies and capabilities required by senior management\nJOB CONTEXT\nOperational skills\ne.g.:\nForeign languages\nMedia interviews\nNegotiation\nCommunication\nSTRATEGIC CONTEXT\nOperational skills (as above)\n+\nAnalytical competencies\ne.g.:\nPEST analysis\nPorter\u2019s Five Forces\nPerformance measurement\n360\u00b0 feedback\nTOP TEAM AND BOARD CONTEXT\nOperational skills (as above)\n+\nAnalytical competencies (as above)\n+\nExecutive capabilities\ne.g.:\nVision\nLeadership\nLong-term dimension\n\u2018Helicopter\u2019 overview\n(Executive development often ends here)\n+\nHigher order, value-added\nbusiness capabilities\ne.g.:\nValue creation\nCorporate differentiation\nRisk management\nGovernance\nCorporate social responsibility\n135\nIf we examine the evaluation grids of the six case study organisations, evidence of\nexecutive development being used to address priorities of adding value to the\norganisation, differentiating it in the marketplace, contributing to risk management\ncapability and dealing with issues of governance and corporate social responsibility is\nlimited in most cases. The organisations that show more awareness of these issues when\ndiscussing executive development tend to have a formal corporate policy for executive\ndevelopment, and are adopting a corporate rather than operational focus for development\nactivities, linking individual and business needs. In other words, it takes careful planning\nto ensure that the right skills, competencies and capabilities are being developed within\nan organisation to meet both individual and corporate needs.\nDevelopmental activity in many organisations often stops once executives reach\nmanagement board level, neglecting the higher-order, value-added capabilities.\nParticularly in organisations where the focus remains on management development rather\nthan top team and board development (operational rather than a corporate focus),\ndevelopment initiatives are not tackling these higher-order issues.\nIn the following paragraphs, we summarise the extent to which each of the case\norganisations are using executive development to support both individual and business\npriorities.\nIn the case of BAA, the overall impression is of an organisation in which some key\npeople, including HR and other senior executives, are keen to see the executive\n136\ndevelopment agenda put into action and are working hard to do so. However, at the same\ntime, comments made highlight a degree of resistance in the company, as there is no\nurgent need for change \u2013 why should people focus on new development activities and\nnew ways of working? This resistance to change is a problem facing other organisations\nas well. BAA focus their executive development strongly on self-awareness, which has\nalso been highlighted as crucial by a number of organisations.\nAt the BBC, there seems to have been a gradual realisation of the value of leadership\ndevelopment, with relevant activities and procedures progressively being introduced.\nExecutive development thus appears to happen ad hoc, as and when the need arises; it\ndoes not appear to be considered as a change tool. As with some of the other\norganisations, there seems to be little perceived need to change the way the corporation\ncurrently operates.\nIn Camelot, we can see the effect of a key individual, the CEO, adopting the executive\ndevelopment agenda and driving action forward. This enthusiasm encourages the\nemphasis on development. At the same time, the quality of the development process in\nterms of achieving organisational aims requires further consideration. However, there is\nan awareness of the need to tackle this potential gap so as to ensure that enthusiasm and\neffort are properly harnessed.\nAt the Home Office, we can see the impact of a traditional Civil Service environment,\nwith high-standard education and training courses available to the most senior managers.\n137\nThis training has been developed specifically for government sector organisations and as\nsuch is viewed as highly relevant. However, the focus is firmly on training and education\nrather than on development. People are encouraged to develop skills and competencies,\nbut perhaps not so much to develop capabilities. Some parts of the Home Office have\nstarted to deal with this issue by creating more opportunities for informal development.\nHowever, for most at senior board level, this type of development remains rare.\nAt the Royal Bank of Scotland the main focus is on integrating two large organisations\nand ensuring that a system of executive development is installed which can draw on the\nbest practice of the two former systems while removing the less effective elements.\nAgain, a tool is being developed in-house to help achieve this. However, the most\ndifficult part of implementation is again the evaluation. This leads to the suggestion that\nthe inherent feeling that training and development is good for organisations will be\nenough to sustain continued investment as long as business performance is improving.\nFinally, at Royal & Sun Alliance, there has in the past been a traditional approach to\ndevelopment through technical skills training and education. However, within the last\nfour years, there have been major changes to the structure of the board and top team and\ntheir evolving culture is shifting the focus of development towards broader management\nand leadership competencies. They do not, as yet, appear to have gone as far as creating a\ncapability focus.\n138\nThese examples from the case organisations reflect many of the issues which firms are\nfacing when they try to design effective development policies and activities. If we\ncompare past to current executive development, we find little change in the methods, and\nhence in the motivations and problems encountered. However, new capabilities are being\nrequired. In today\u2019s dynamic world, flexibility has been shown to be a key requirement of\nsenior management. The roles, responsibilities and accountabilities of directors are varied\nand often lacking in clarity in environments subject to frequent change through\nrestructuring and acquisitions. Tasks and hence capability requirements are therefore\ndifficult to identify, making the important process of executive development needs\nanalysis truly challenging.\nIn summary, turbulence and constant pressure for improvement demand that development\nactivity is focused on organisational rather than on individual needs. Key themes for\nmodern executive development are beginning to emerge, particularly in relation to\noperating in a global market, and key capabilities are being identified, such as self-\nawareness. The dynamism of change and advances in technology will continue to\nincrease the demand for and supply of executive development. Customised programmes\ndrawing on the expertise of specialists in organisation analysis will be prime facilitators\nof change in organisations, with business becoming increasingly demanding regarding the\ndelivery of results. The role of the Human Resources function in facilitating the\ndevelopment plan and integrating it into the business strategy is critical in this\nenvironment.\n139\n6. Findings, Summary and Conclusions\n6.1 Research findings on nine key questions\nThe study set out to find clarification around the nine research questions summarised in\nthe Research Methodology section of this work. A summary of the findings is included\nhere alongside each question. More often than not, the answers gathered raised further\nand more diverse issues, which this study has attempted to address throughout.\n1. How clearly defined are top team members\u2019 and directors' (executive and non-\nexecutive) roles and responsibilities, to meet both present and future challenges? Is\nsuch definition important?\n\uf0b7 The terminology of top teams and boards is complex and sometimes confused.\n\uf0b7 Clarification is a crucial starting point to instigating any plan for top team and\nboard development to ensure organisational needs are met.\n\uf0b7 This clarification must be flexible enough to allow for changes in the dynamic\nsocial and market environments in which businesses operate today.\n\uf0b7 Top teams and boards face conflicting pressures, requiring clear definition of\npriorities, if not specific responsibilities, to aid senior management performance.\n2. What are the skills, competencies and capabilities required to meet these roles and\nresponsibilities, now and into the future? Typically, how well are these articulated?\n\uf0b7 There is an important distinction between the meaning of the terms skills,\ncompetencies and capabilities. Skill is a specific expertise, competencies are an\n140\naggregate of skills required to address complex problems, whereas capability is\nthe ability to apply both skills and competencies in a particular context that is\nperceived to add value to the situation.\n\uf0b7 Capability development should be at the top of any top team and board\ndevelopment agenda.\n\uf0b7 Although there are some attempts to define generic capability requirements at the\nsenior management level, it is more effective for these requirements to be defined\nin line with the context of a specific organisation.\n\uf0b7 Performance requirements can be broken down for the different members of the\ntop team and board, although this is rarely done to any degree of clarity by\norganisations today. The need for flexibility is perceived as outweighing the need\nfor prescription.\n\uf0b7 Leadership and governance are amongst the most critical capabilities required of\nmembers of top teams and boards. Both require high levels of self-awareness and\nunderstanding of the corporate context.\n3. To what extent do top team and board members feel the need to undertake personal\nand collective development and career planning, and to act as role models for leaders\nand managers at other levels \u2013 and to what extent do they demonstrate any such\nconviction?\n\uf0b7 Top team and board development is often confused in organisations with concepts\nof training and education, increasing the likelihood of a rejection by senior\n141\nmanagers who feel that they do not need to learn any more than they have already,\ngiven their extensive experience.\n\uf0b7 Development at this level is, however, about maintaining and improving\ncapability, with less focus on specific functional expertise or general management\ncompetency.\n\uf0b7 Top team and board development should focus on how individual senior\nmanagers and teams can add value to the organisation and achieve corporate\ngoals.\n\uf0b7 When senior managers can see how their development can help the performance\nof the company, the likelihood of buy-in to any executive development scheme is\nincreased.\n\uf0b7 Organisations with effective development strategies are able to display senior\nmanagers who are keen to act as role models for development throughout the\norganisation.\n\uf0b7 Career management is rarely expressed as being a priority of development at the\nsenior management level.\n4. What obstacles exist to development and career planning at board and top team level,\nand how best can they be overcome?\n\uf0b7 An inability to see the potential pay-off for the enterprise from executive\ndevelopment leads to a perceived lack of need for further capability development.\n\uf0b7 This is often due to an attitude of people believing that they have reached the top\nbased on their skills and hence do not need to improve them, leading to a lack of\n142\ntime or resources being made available for an executive development strategy to\nbe implemented.\n\uf0b7 If executive development does not have a champion in the organisation who can\ndrive the strategy through with passion and enthusiasm, the negative barriers are\nmore likely to win over at the end of the day due to everyday pressures of time\nand money.\n\uf0b7 Career planning is a highly sensitive topic at senior director level, and as such\nreceives little comment when exploring development.\n5. How effective are the steps taken to identify the collective and individual\ndevelopment needs of top team and board members with regard to personal, team and\norganisational challenges?\n\uf0b7 When senior managers start new positions in the top team and board, few\norganisations provide any form of induction to aid the individual\u2019s assimilation in\nthe new environment.\n\uf0b7 At the most senior level of organisations, the most common pattern is for\nindividuals to have to identify their own development needs and to instigate\naction to meet these.\n\uf0b7 Facilitation of development needs analysis is, however, a critical element of an\noverall top team and board development strategy to ensure that both the needs of\nthe individual and the organisation are being considered and met.\n\uf0b7 The key to determining and meeting needs is to ensure that senior managers\nthemselves are involved in the design and review of any development programme.\n143\n6. To what extent, and typically how, are development practice and career management\nevaluated at this level, and could such evaluation be improved? If so, how?\n\uf0b7 Evaluation of the outcomes of top team and board development and career\nmanagement is the hardest task faced by the champions of this activity. Linking\nindividual activities with corporate performance is challenging, all the more so\nwhen development programmes have been designed well and are integrated into\nall aspects of corporate life.\n\uf0b7 Common measures for evaluation include frequency and breadth of participation\nat formal events in terms of justifying investment. The softer measures of\nemployee satisfaction and organisational culture are measured less frequently but\ncan perhaps give a better indication of whether or not development is achieving its\nstated aims.\n\uf0b7 Ultimately the amount of top team and board development undertaken, or the\ninvestment made, is irrelevant in terms of good practice if at the end of the day the\ncompany is failing. Individual senior managers, and hence their capabilities,\nembody their company, and are perceived as one by stakeholders both internal\nand external to the company.\n7. Given that there are different types of board and top team structures - and different\norganisational circumstances (e.g. growth, stability, contraction) to be managed -\nwhat approach will maximise the effectiveness of capability development at this\nlevel?\n144\n\uf0b7 Capability development is crucially context specific. Generic models of\nleadership and governance competencies can be designed. However, what will be\neffective in different enterprises at different moments in time will vary\ndramatically.\n\uf0b7 A thorough understanding of the business, in terms of corporate language as well\nas corporate goals, corporate culture and how the business is perceived externally,\nis fundamental to commencing the design of any top team and board development\nactivity.\n\uf0b7 A broad-based knowledge of theories of leadership and governance can assist\nindividuals when deciding what action is best to take in their own circumstances.\n8. Does development for top team and board members take place more on or off the job?\n\uf0b7 Top team and board development should rarely consist of only formal training\ncourses. It should be closely matched to what people want and what they feel\ncomfortable with.\n\uf0b7 Formal, planned development activities at the top team and board level tend to\ntake place off-the-job. These include activities such as away-days, seminars, and\nconferences.\n\uf0b7 Informal, unplanned on-the-job development occurs at all levels of organisations\ndaily but the benefits are frequently missed. Transferring skills through casual\nconversations and attendance at particular meetings or events are often not\nformalised as learning activity and as such are soon forgotten.\n145\n\uf0b7 Coaching and mentoring at senior management level are significant tools to\nfacilitate the development process, and are particularly effective when linked to\nthe production by individuals of their own personal development plans.\n\uf0b7 Organisations often make use of development programmes provided by\nprofessional bodies and business schools. The programmes need to be closely\ncustomised to the organisational needs to ensure the learning is effective and can\nbe transferred back to the place of work.\n9. Are there issues deemed too sensitive to discuss at top team or board level? If so,\nwhat are the consequences?\n\uf0b7 Fear of change and fear of exposing weakness are important issues quoted by\norganisations as to why executive development can fail.\n\uf0b7 Senior level individuals have made immense achievements reaching the positions\nthey hold, and as such, any activity which may undermine this position can be\nstrongly rejected, disrupting an entire executive development programme.\n\uf0b7 By addressing the issue of the positive value of top team and board development\nand creating an organisational culture in which learning is encouraged and\nsupported are first steps to overcoming the sensitivity of these issues at top team\nand board level.\n6.2 Summary of key emergent issues\n146\nExecutive development as defined in this study is aimed at addressing the needs of\nindividuals at senior management, executive and director level, simultaneous with\nmeeting broader corporate needs.\nWhat the literature tells us\n\uf0b7 Executive development is a key strategy for improving organisational performance,\nprofessionalism and competitive advantage, and particularly for managing change and\nmeeting organisational stakeholder expectations.\n\uf0b7 In today\u2019s dynamic market and social environments, board and top team members\nrequire many different capabilities as they undertake a variety of sometimes\nconflicting tasks.\n\uf0b7 Business-focused development is becoming increasingly popular, with many\nprogrammes being developed in-house, and highly customised development activities\nbeing demanded from external providers.\n\uf0b7 There has been a rise in joint ventures between organisations and universities to\nprovide programmes tailored to specific company needs. Executive MBA\nprogrammes have grown in scope and number over the past decade.\n\uf0b7 Skills, competencies and capabilities are distinguishable from one another. The\nappropriate balance between them at senior management levels is central to\norganisational success.\n\uf0b7 As a component of executive development, considerable attention has been paid to\ntransformational and visionary leadership, promoting the idea of inspiring people to\npursue a shared vision or common goal.\n147\n\uf0b7 In addition to leadership issues, approaches to corporate governance have a\nsignificant impact on executive development requirements in terms of meeting\ncorporate priorities.\n\uf0b7 It is development, rather than training or education, that senior managers will benefit\nfrom most.\n\uf0b7 Induction, away-days, seminars and conferences are often absent from the executive\ndevelopment agenda, but they are powerful ways to improve collective and individual\ndirector performance.\n\uf0b7 Although organisations attempt to justify their investment in development, it is\ndifficult to prove any causal link between a development intervention and company\nperformance.\nWhat organisations tell us\n\uf0b7 The HR function has a significant but challenging role to play in facilitating and\npromoting executive development but must work closely with senior managers to\nensure its relevance to the individuals and the enterprise.\n\uf0b7 As a result of market and social dynamism, functional and operational tasks often\npredominate over the corporate role of executives.\n\uf0b7 A number of interviewees cited \u2018self-awareness\u2019 \u2013 the ability to recognise and realise\none\u2019s own potential \u2013 as a key capability for senior-level executives.\n\uf0b7 Although leadership is considered an essential element of executive development,\nthere is no single model of leadership that applies to all situations \u2013 flexibility and\nsensitivity in leadership style are key executive capabilities.\n148\n\uf0b7 Executive capability is reflected in corporate image and is therefore seen by both\ninternal and external stakeholders as a measure of the company\u2019s performance.\n\uf0b7 Many organisations encourage their executives to contrive their own development,\nwith few having a formal executive development policy.\n\uf0b7 Approaches to executive development tend to involve a mixture of formal and\ninformal in-house learning, with coaching and mentoring playing a significant role.\n\uf0b7 Evaluating the impact of development after any form of intervention is rare. The most\ncommon method of evaluation when it does take place is 360\u00ba appraisal.\n\uf0b7 Despite its recognised benefits, the key reasons cited for not undertaking development\nare lack of time or money, and the reluctance of senior managers to acknowledge\ntheir need for further development.\n\uf0b7 There is a trend away from trying to measure the direct effects of development on\nprofitability and towards understanding how it contributes to attracting and retaining\nstaff, knowledge creation and sharing, and growing effective leaders within an\norganisation.\n6.3 Conclusions\nWe can develop a model of skills, competencies and capabilities in the executive,\nmanagement and operational work domains. Ultimately, however, development at the\nsenior management level appears to be determined by context rather than being capable\nof being confined to a single, generic model. A vision for the organisation needs to be put\ninto place and supported by (a) appropriate strategies, (b) a suitable executive\n149\ndevelopment agenda, and (c) a Human Resources function that is innovative in its\napproach and its tackling of tensions and barriers.\nThis leads us to highlight five of the key learning points from this study:\n1. The importance of understanding how the context within and surrounding the\norganisation determines the shape and nature of executive development for\nindividuals and organisations alike.\n2. The importance of understanding the full range of skills, competencies and\ncapabilities required of executives, and the role of HR and each individual executive\nin developing an appropriate balance in an organisation.\n3. The breadth of knowledge required by senior managers is vast, covering many topics\nincluding leadership and governance, which all call for whole sets of competencies in\ntheir own right. Executive capability involves achieving this breadth.\n4. The importance of self-awareness and self-motivation for personal and career\ndevelopment at the top level of organisations.\n5. Current approaches to development are reported as failing to take full account of\nissues like value creation, corporate differentiation, risk management, governance and\ncorporate social responsibility, which have all been shown to be key capabilities of\nthe executive role.\nThe extent to which each of our case study organisations has achieved these five elements\nis varied. All emphasised the importance of context and ensuring that development was\ndelivering the results that the organisation needs. However, the balance of skills,\n150\ncompetencies and capabilities has perhaps received the least attention, with only one\norganisation talking about needing to develop capabilities above the level of competency\nto ensure corporate results. The breadth of executive development is often limited in the\nknowledge areas it covers, often not addressing concepts such as governance, added-\nvalue, risk management and market differentiation. However, self-awareness is a key\ntheme of many of the executive development programmes which have been developed in-\nhouse by key individuals in certain of the case study organisations.\nWe close this study by observing that throughout the case organisation interviews it was\nclear that, where the Human Resources function has a view of the enterprise as a whole,\nand is able to speak the corporate language, executive development activity is more likely\nto be both effective and seen to be contributing to business goals.\n151\nAppendix\nThis report was presented on 17 October 2002 at a meeting of member organisations of\nthe Careers Research Forum.
