(When a cementing material is also\nadded, the material is known as \u2018stabilised\u2019 rammed earth.\nThis note is concerned only with \u2018unstabilised\u2019 rammed\nearth.) The technique has been in use by humanity for\nthousands of years, and many historic structures containing\nrammed earth features remain standing to this day. Examples\ninclude the Potala Palace in Tibet and the Alhambra in\nGranada, Spain.\nUntil recently, rammed earth was regarded much as\nmasonry was regarded until the 1950s: that is, a building\nmaterial for which design was, in general, based on heur-\nistics and past experience. As with masonry, however, the\nneed to use rammed earth and other earth building materials\nin unusual situations, or subject to unusual loadings,\nprompted further scientific examination.\nThe modern resurgence in rammed earth is concentrated\nin particular parts of the world, such as California and\nWestern Australia (Hodsdon, 2006; Easton, 2007), but there\nis interest in the UK, as evidenced by the recent production\nof a design guide (Walker et al., 2005). An example of a\nmodern UK rammed earth wall is shown in Fig. 1. There\nhas been surprisingly little investigation of rammed earth\nthrough laboratory testing to date, although it is clear that\ngreater understanding is needed, both to conserve historic\nrammed earth structures and to promote the spread of new-\nbuild rammed earth. External rammed earth walls can be\nsubjected to large changes in humidity and incident wetting\nfrom rainfall. The purpose of this paper is to record initial\ngeotechnical testing to investigate the source of strength in\nrammed earth, linking it to suction and water content.\nTo date, rammed earth has been regarded as a structural\nmaterial much like masonry or concrete, and rules for design\nhave developed accordingly. Little advice is available on the\nanalysis of rammed earth structures, and even less on the\norigins of the material\u2019s strength. Walker et al. (2005)\ncontains much guidance for the design and construction of\nrammed earth walls, which indicates that the most widely\nused measure of strength is unconfined compressive strength.\nVarious heuristic rules are also available to determine the\nstrength of rammed earth (e.g. King, 1997), although these\nare specific to the local conditions studied, and few labora-\ntory studies are available (Lilley & Robinson, 1995). Know-\nledge that moisture affects the strength of rammed earth is\nevident in a number of these studies, although most are\nconcerned to ensure ramming is carried out at a moisture\ncontent for good workability rather than optimum for dry\ndensity. Walker et al. (2005) state that \u2018compressive strength\nof moist rammed earth materials is likely to be at least 50%\nlower than the final ambient values\u2019, one of the few\nManuscript received 1 August 2007; revised manuscript accepted 14\nNovember 2008.

A modern rammed earth wall at Rivergreen Develop-\nments, Aykley Heads, Durham\ninstances where development of strength over time, due to\ndrying, is recognised.\nA GEOTECHNICAL MATERIAL\nThinking geotechnically, rammed earth can be regarded as\na compacted soil, but constructed into a form that is not\nusually considered for soil (i.e. a wall). Since the material is\ninitially compacted and then allowed to dry it will be\nunsaturated, where the soil particles are surrounded by air in\naddition to water.\nIt is widely accepted that unsaturated soils achieve a\ncomponent of strength through matric suction, s \u00bc ua \u0001 uw\n(where ua is the pore air pressure and uw is the pore water\npressure), which can be considered as an apparent cohesion.\nAs soils dry, so suction increases, and consequently there is\nan increase in apparent cohesion and hence strength.\nClearly this suction-induced increase of apparent cohesion\nis not unlimited. Toll & Ong (2003) show that the contribu-\ntion to strength from suction in a sandy clay reduces as the\ndegree of saturation reduces. So, although suction increases\nas the soil dries out, the contribution to strength reaches a\npeak and then drops away (Toll, 1991). The apparent cohe-\nsion is therefore expected to peak between the two limits of\nzero water content and saturation. It should, however, be\nrecognised that zero water content corresponds to an ideal\nlimit condition as, even for an oven-dry soil, adsorbed water\nwill still be present on clay particles and will be available to\ngenerate suctions.\nTotal suction is the sum of matric suction and osmotic\nsuction, which is a function of the salts dissolved in the pore\nwater. Total suction \u0001 is linked to the relative humidity RH\nof the pore air through Kelvin\u2019s equation, which can be\nexpressed as\n\u0001 \u00bc \u0001rwRT\nwv\nln RH\u00f0 \u00de (1)\nwhere R is the universal gas constant, T is absolute tempera-\nture, rw is the density of water, and wv is the molecular\nmass of water vapour (Likos & Lu, 2002). Equation (1)\nshows that variations in RH between 100% and 95% lead to\ntotal suctions up to 1000 kPa. Development of suctions\nbeyond this point requires very large changes in RH. These\nappear more likely for soil in a rammed earth wall than, for\ninstance, soil in the vadose zone (owing to the larger sur-\nface-to-volume ratio in the former case). Evaporation of pore\nwater is affected by the relative humidity of the pore air\ncompared with that of the adjacent air outside the wall. In\npractice, drying of the walls will continue until the pore air\nhumidity equals the humidity of the surrounding air.\nGiven the above, it seems obvious that a component of\nthe strength of rammed earth must be due to matric suction,\nalthough this has not been proposed in the past, to our\nknowledge. A small programme of simple geotechnical test-\ning was carried out to provide evidence of a link between\nmatric suction and strength in rammed earth materials using\ntests that would be accessible outside the specialist geo-\ntechnical testing community. All tests were undertaken at\nconstant water content, and are similar to some of those\ndescribed in Vanapalli & Fredlund (1997) and Vanapalli et\nal. (1998). The tests are preliminary, and form the first part\nof a larger programme of research under way at Durham\nUniversity. In addition to suction, there must also be a\ncomponent of strength due to the ramming process, which\nwill produce increased strength due to densification and\npossibly particle interlock, but this aspect is not investigated\nhere.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nThe rammed earth mixture used in this study was taken\nfrom a development site at Aykley Heads, Durham, which\nincluded a large rammed earth wall (located inside a new\nbuilding; Fig. 1). The mixture used on site was blended from\nmaterial dug locally (alluvial sand), coarse aggregate and a\npowdered clay\/silt mixed in proportions (0.25 : 0.60 : 0.15;\naggregate : sand : clay) using a horizontal-axis mixer. For the\npurposes of these tests this rammed earth mixture was sieved\nto remove material retained on a 14 mm sieve. The particle\nsize distribution for the test material is shown in Fig. 2.\nPrior to sample preparation, the compaction curve for this\nrammed earth mixture was obtained by using a vibrating\nhammer (to BS 1377). This is shown in Fig. 3, and indicates\nthat a sample prepared at a water content of 12% is close to\nsaturation: corresponding to site practice as outlined above,\nthis was the water content used to compact all samples\ntested in this work. The vibrating hammer test was used in\npreference to the standard Proctor test as it better resembled\nthe compaction effort in a real rammed earth wall and in the\nsample preparation described below.\nCylindrical samples (200 mm 3 100 mm diameter) were\nprepared using a Proctor split compaction mould, as outlined\nin Walker (2002), with modifications developed at Durham.\nSamples were compacted in five layers using 15 blows of a\n4.5 kg hammer each time, following which a screed of\nparticles passing a 425 \u0002m sieve was placed on the top\nsurface of the cylinder. This screed produced a flat loading\nsurface and a fine particle paste on which to place the\ntensiometer used to measure matric suction.

Dry densities between 2017 and 2061 Mg\/m3\n(similar to the dry density corresponding to a water content\nof 12% in the compaction curve of Fig. 2) were achieved\nusing the same compactive effort each time. Once samples\nhad air-dried to their respective target water contents (mon-\nitored through regular weighing), they were wrapped in an\nimpermeable sheath secured with rubber O-rings placed\nagainst steel loading plates at the top and bottom. Target\nwater contents were chosen to provide a well-spaced range\nof results. The samples were then left for at least 7 days to\nallow suctions to equilibrate throughout the sample, follow-\ning which it was considered that the samples were ready for\ntesting.\nThe samples were sheared under constant water content\nconditions in a triaxial rig. Displacement was controlled at a\nconstant 0.1 mm\/min and measurements of suction, load and\naxial displacement taken every 10 s. High-capacity tensi-\nometers were used to allow direct measurement of suction at\nthe top of the sample throughout the test (Lourenc\u00b8o et al.,\n2006).\nRESULTS AND INTERPRETATION\nSix unconfined compression tests at constant water content\nwere carried out on samples air-dried to different target\nwater contents.\nThe suction measured on each of the six samples prior to\nshearing is shown against the corresponding water content in\nFig. 4. Points on this plot represent measurements taken on\ndifferent specimens dried to different water contents (i.e. it\nis not a continuous drying curve from a single specimen).\nThe speculated behaviour for very low suctions is shown by\na broken line back to the compaction water content of 12%,\nwhich corresponds to a suction around 1 kPa. The higher\nsuction values in Fig. 4 are significant compared with those\nusually reported for unsaturated soils, either naturally occur-\nring or arising from compaction.\nPlots of deviator stress against suction are shown in Fig.\n5. There is a clear link between initial water content and\nboth suction and strength (measured as maximum deviator\nstress). In tests at low water contents (5.5\u20138.3%) suction is\nseen to drop during the test, whereas the opposite is\napparent in the higher water content tests (9.4\u201310.2%).\nThe stiffness behaviour of the material is shown in plots\nof axial total stress against axial strain in Fig. 6. On a\nqualitative level the wetter samples have greater ductility\nwhereas the drier samples are brittle. Fig. 7 shows the\nvariation in suction during the tests against axial strain. The\nplot shows the rate of suction change reducing with axial\nstrain, as seen in other studies of unsaturated soils (e.g. Toll\n& Ong, 2003).\nFor shearing under constant water content conditions, the\nfact that samples with initially low suctions show an increase\nin suction during shear whereas samples with high suction\nshow the opposite is compatible with the existence of a\nunique water content\u2013suction relationship at the critical\nstate. Toll (1990) showed such behaviour for constant water\ncontent tests on lateritic gravel. There is a suggestion that\nthere is a unique relationship between water content and\nsuction at the critical state after the work of Croney &\nColeman (1954), Brady (1988), Ridley (1995) and Tarantino\n(2007). The data show samples at low suction increasing in\nsuction, whereas the reverse is true of samples at high\nsuction.\nIt is also interesting to note that suctions may reduce (i.e.\npore water pressures increase), even when the volumetric\nbehaviour is dilatant, which might seem counter-intuitive.\nToll (1990) explained this in terms of the aggregated fabric\nof compacted soils (often referred to as \u2018double structure\u2019).\n12\n11\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n1 100 10000\nSuction: kPa\nW\na\nte\nr \nco\nnt\nen\nt: \n%\nFig. 4.

Plots of suction against axial strain\nTHE STRENGTH OF UNSTABILISED RAMMED EARTH MATERIALS 489\nThe suction response results from compression within the\naggregates (intra-aggregate), whereas the dilatant volumetric\nbehaviour is controlled by the macro fabric (inter-aggregate)\nwhere shearing occurs between aggregates. Fig. 6 also\nindicates that the stiffness of the samples is suction depen-\ndent. In a critical state framework this could be accommo-\ndated as a link between elastic shear modulus and suction,\nsimilar to that suggested for bulk modulus in tests on\ncompacted unsaturated soils by Mancuso et al. (2000).\nThe rammed earth tested in this work is clearly in differ-\nent conditions from the rammed earth present in a heritage\nstructure, for instance, and no in situ suction measurements\nof \u2018aged\u2019 rammed earth are presented here. However, if the\nlink between suction and strength is maintained in rammed\nearth that has had time to dry in situ to relatively low values\nof water content, the results of Fig. 5 would indicate that the\nratio of strength between aged in situ rammed earth and\nmoist \u2018fresh\u2019 rammed earth may be much more than the\nfactor of 2, as previously suggested by Walker et al. (2005).\nEqually, if the in situ drying is taken further towards the\nlimit when all water is removed from the material, then it is\nspeculated that the apparent cohesion will start to drop back,\ndue to the reduced efficacy of suction acting within the\nrammed earth. This failure due to drying is not seen in\npractice, because the pore structure of the material (due to\nthe clay content) and the level of RH experienced do not\nallow for complete drying out.\nCONCLUSION\nThe tests reported in this paper aim to show that suction\nis a source of strength in unstabilised rammed earth, and\nthat the strength increases as water content reduces. The\ntests necessarily use laboratory-prepared samples of rammed\nearth, which may be in a different state from the rammed\nearth found in a wall, particularly one that is of some\nantiquity. However, the underlying source of strength should\nbe the same. The soil materials in rammed earth are able to\ndry to a much lower degree of saturation than the majority\nof soils considered by geotechnical engineers because they\nare constructed as walls open to the atmosphere. Walls left\nto dry after construction, in a suitable climate, can be\nexpected to develop very large suctions in the remaining\npore water, and hence develop considerable strength over\ntime. Further characterisation of rammed earth materials in\ngeotechnical frameworks is necessary if the behaviour of\nexisting heritage rammed earth is to be understood and the\ndevelopment of a design procedure for new-build rammed\nearth is to be rooted in a stronger scientific basis.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe first author was supported by an EPSRC DTA PhD\nstudentship.
