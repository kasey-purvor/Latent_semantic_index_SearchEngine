In 3,5-\ndinitroaniline, C6H5N3O4, where Z\n0 = 2, the molecules are\nlinked by three N\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O hydrogen bonds [N\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O 3.344 (2)\u00b1\n3.433 (2) A\u00ca and N\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O 150\u00b1167\u000e] into deeply puckered\nnets, each of which is interwoven with its two immediate\nneighbours.\nComment\nMononitroanilines and their simple C-methylated derivatives\ncan form hydrogen-bonded supramolecular structures in one,\ntwo, or three dimensions. Thus, 2-nitroaniline (Dhaneshwar et\nal., 1978) and 4-methyl-2-nitroaniline (Cannon et al., 2001)\nboth form simple chains, 3-nitroaniline (Ploug-S\u00f9rensen &\nAndersen, 1986) and 4-nitroaniline (Tonogaki et al., 1993)\nboth form sheets, while 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline forms a three-\ndimensional framework (Ferguson et al., 2001). Although the\nmethyl groups play no direct role in the hydrogen bonding,\nnonetheless they can have a major in\u00afuence on the overall\nsupramolecular structure in some instances. Thus, while\n3-nitroaniline forms sheets, its 4-methyl analogue (Cannon et\nal., 2001) forms a mixture of ladders and simple chains; simi-\nlarly the supramolecular structure of 4-nitroaniline is two-\ndimensional, while that of its 2-methyl analogue is three-\ndimensional.\nNotional replacement of a methyl group by either a second\namino group or by a second nitro group, which thus introduces\nan excess either of hydrogen-bond donors or of hydrogen-\nbond acceptors, may be expected to have a signi\u00aecant in\u00afu-\nence of the resulting supramolecular structures. We report\nhere the structures of two such examples, 1,3-diamino-4-\nnitrobenzene, (I), which has an excess of donors, and 3,5-\ndinitroaniline, (II), which has an excess of acceptors.\nIn compound (I) (Fig. 1), there is an intramolecular N\u00d0\nH\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O hydrogen bond, forming an S(6) motif, as observed in\n2-nitroaniline itself and in its C-methyl derivatives. In addi-\ntion, each molecule acts as a double donor of intermolecular\nN\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O hydrogen bonds (Table 2), utilizing for this purpose\njust one N\u00d0H bond in each amino group, and as a double\nacceptor of such bonds; the molecules are thereby linked into\nplanar (4,4) nets (Batten & Robson, 1998) parallel to (010).\nThese nets are most simply analysed in terms of chain\nformation along the [101] and [101] directions. Atom N3 acts\nas a hydrogen-bond donor, via H31, to O2 at (12 + x,\n3\n2 \u00ff y,\nActa Cryst. (2001).

This chain is enhanced by a rather weak C\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O\nhydrogen bond to the same acceptor atom (Table 2). At the\nsame time, atom N1 acts as donor, via H12, to O1 at (\u00ff12 + x,\n3\n2 \u00ff y, 12 + z) and in this way a C(8) chain running parallel to\n[101] is generated by the same glide plane. The combination of\nthe [101] and [101] chains of N\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O hydrogen-bonded\nmolecules generates the (4,4) net built from a single type of\nR4\n4(24) ring (Fig. 2). The non-H atoms of this net lie in the\ndomain 0.51 < y < 0.99, and there is a second similar net\npassing through the unit cell, generated by the glide plane at\ny = 0.25 and lying in the domain 0.01 < y < 0.49. There are no\nhydrogen bonds or \u0019\u00b1\u0019-stacking interactions between adja-\ncent nets, so that the supramolecular aggregation is strictly\ntwo-dimensional.\nThe supramolecular structure of compound (I) may be\ncompared with those of both 2-nitroaniline and 4-nitroaniline,\nas the molecular constitution of (I) shares features with both\nthese nitroanilines. The intramolecular S(6) motif is common\nto both (I) and 2-nitroaniline, as is the formation of C(6)\nchains. On the other hand, the formation of a (4,4) net is\nobserved both in (I) and in 4-nitroaniline, but the surprising\nfeature in (I) is that the net formation utilizes only one N\u00d0H\nbond per amino group, while one of the N\u00d0H bonds, N1\u00d0\nH11, does not participate at all in the hydrogen bonding\n(Table 2).\nCompound (II) crystallizes with Z0 = 2 in P21\/n: the\ndifferent hydrogen-bonding characteristics of the two inde-\npendent molecules (Table 4) are suf\u00aecient to rule out the\npossibility of any additional symmetry. Within the selected\nasymmetric unit (Fig. 3), N11 in molecule 1 acts as hydrogen-\nbond donor, via H1A, to O23 in molecule 2, and each of these\ntwo-molecule units is linked to four others: N11 and N21 each\nacts as a single donor, via H1B and H2B, respectively, while\nO12 and O21 are each single acceptors. The primary\nhydrogen-bonded structure is a sheet, most easily analysed in\nterms of the linking of spiral chains. Atom N11 at (x, y, z) acts\nas donor, via H1B, to O21 at (12 \u00ff x, \u00ff12 + y, 12 \u00ff z), while N11\nat (12 \u00ff x, \u00ff12 + y, 12 \u00ff z) in turn acts as donor to O21 at (x,\n\u00ff1 + y, z); this hydrogen bond thus produces a C22(10) chain\nrunning parallel to the [010] direction and generated by the 21\nscrew axis along (14,y,\n1\n4). The molecules of types 1 and 2\nalternate along this chain, acting as double donors and double\nacceptors, respectively. These chains are linked into contin-\nuous sheets by a third N\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O hydrogen bond. Atom N21\nat (x, y, z) acts as donor, via H2B, to O12 at (1 + x, 1 + y, z), so\nproducing by translation a C2\n2(14) chain parallel to the [110]\ndirection; the molecules of types 1 and 2 again alternate along\nthis chain, but within this chain each acts as a single donor and\na single acceptor. The combination of the [010] and [110]\nchains generates a deeply puckered sheet parallel to (001)\nbuilt from R10\n10(58) rings (Fig. 4). There are two such sheets\nrunning through each unit cell, related to one another by the\naction of the centres of inversion. The original sheet lies in the\ndomain \u00ff0.25 < z < 0.75 and its symmetry-generated\nFigure 2\nPart of the crystal structure of (I) showing the formation of a (010) net\nbuilt from R4\n4(24) rings. For the sake of clarity, H atoms bonded to C\natoms have been omitted. Atoms marked with an asterisk (*) or hash (#)\nare at the symmetry positions (\u00ff12 + x, 32 \u00ff y, 12 + z) and (12 + x, 32 \u00ff y, 12 + z)\nrespectively.\nFigure 3\nThe two independent molecules in (II) showing the atom-labelling\nschemes for (a) molecule 1 and (b) molecule 2. Displacement ellipsoids\nare drawn at the 30% probability level.\ncompanion lies in the domain 0.25 < z < 1.25. Because of the\npuckered nature of these sheets, each sheet is interwoven with\nits two immediate neighbours, so producing a continuous\nthree-dimensional network of interwoven sheets.\nIsomeric with compound (I) are 2,4-dinitroaniline [Cam-\nbridge Structural Database (CSD; Allen & Kennard, 1993)\nrefcode QQQFNG02 (Prasad et al., 1982)] and 2,6-dinitro-\naniline (CUZDEG; Parkanyi & Kalman, 1984). The molecules\nin QQQFNG02 contain the intramolecular S(6) motif char-\nacteristic of 2-nitroanilines and, in addition, they are linked by\npaired N\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O and C\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O hydrogen bonds into chains\nof fused alternating S(6) and R2\n2(8) rings (Fig. 5). In\nCUZDEG, the amino group forms S(6) motifs with both nitro\ngroups and a combination of N\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O and C\u00d0H\u0001 \u0001 \u0001O\nhydrogen bonds links the molecules into a chain of fused\nR4\n4(13) rings from which the paired S(6) rings are pendent\n(Fig. 6).\nThe two C\u00d0NH2 distances in compound (I) are very\ndifferent (Table 1), but the longer of these is very similar to the\ntwo independent C\u00d0NH2 distances in compound (II). On the\nother hand, the C\u00d0NO2 distance in (I) is ca 0.10 A\u00ca shorter\nthan the corresponding distances in (II), which are closely\ngrouped about their mean value of 1.469 (2) A\u00ca . These obser-\nvations, together with the marked C\u00d0C bond \u00aexation in (I),\nindicate that in (I) there is an important contribution from the\nquinonoid form (Ia), but essentially none from the alternative\nform (Ib). It is thus interesting to note that in QQQFNG02,\nthe pattern of C\u00d0N and C\u00d0C bond lengths points clearly to\nform (IIIa) as an important contributor to the exclusion of\nform (IIIb). In compound (II), the 1,3,5-substitution pattern\neffectively precludes the development of such forms, although\nthere is a clear distinction between the lengths of the eight C\u00d0\nC bonds adjacent to an NO2 group [range 1.365 (2)\u00b1\n1.380 (2) A\u00ca , mean 1.376 (2) A\u00ca ] and the four such bonds\nremote from an NO2 group [range 1.389 (2)\u00b11.396 (2) A\u00ca ,\nmean 1.392 (2) A\u00ca ].\nExperimental\nCommercial samples of compounds (I) and (II) were puri\u00aeed by\nchromatography on silica gel with CHCl3 as eluant.
