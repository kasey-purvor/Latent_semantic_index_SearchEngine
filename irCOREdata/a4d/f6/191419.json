In fully \ndifferentiated skeletal muscle fibres, \nimmunolabelling of caveolin-3 was observed \nusing confocal microscopy (CLSM) as a regular \npattern of bright nodes, 1.48 m apart in the long \naxis. The aim of this study was to observe the \nchanges that occur in myoblasts as they \ndifferentiate, and to observe the development of \nany pattern of caveolin-3 immunolabelling. \nA mouse muscle myoblast cell line, C2C12, was \ncultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium \n(DMEM) with 2mM L-glutamine, 100U penicillin, \n0.1mg streptomycin, and 10% foetal bovine \nserum (FBS). To trigger differentiation, this \nculture medium was replaced with one \ncontaining 10% horse serum in place of FBS. \nCultures (approximately 80% confluent) were \nallowed to differentiate for 0-21 days, and then \nfixed in 2.5% formaldehyde solution. An indirect \nimmunofluorescence method was used to label \ncaveolin-3 in coverslip-attached cells. Cultures \nwere observed using CLSM and DIC optics. \nAs the days of differentiation increased, changes \nwere observed. Before differentiation, little \ncaveolin-3 immunofluorescence was observed. \nMost cells had only one nucleus. From day 3, \nmultinucleated syncytia began to appear, and \ncaveolin-3 labelling increased. This was largely \nperinuclear. Cells elongated and better aligned as \ntime increased. Subsequently caveolin-3 labelling \nwas marginalised towards the membranes, and \nthe regular pattern of fluorescent nodes began to \nbe observed. By day 9, many long, \nmultinucleated fibres were seen, in a regular \narrangement with bright caveolin-3 labelling. \nHowever, some mono-nucleated cells were still \nseen at this and later time points. \nThis method is useful to monitor morphological \nand local compositional changes that occur in \nskeletal muscle myoblasts as they form \nmyotubes. Immunolabelling of muscle proteins \nallows their expression to be observed during \ndifferentiation. These images show that not all \nmyoblasts in this culture differentiate at the \nsame rate. Some cells still divide and grow while \nothers differentiate. \nFunding was provided by the ASGBI. \n \n"}
