Introduction\nMany important processes in the living cell are based on networks of enzyme-controlled\nchemical reactions where the enzyme activity is strongly temperature dependent; see,\nfor example, [13,19,20,23,27]. A commonly used parameter to measure the temperature\ndependence of a chemical reaction is Q10, which is defined as the change in reaction rate with\na 108K change in temperature. For example, a Q10 value of 2.0 would imply a two-fold\nComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine\nISSN 1748-670X print\/ISSN 1748-6718 online q 2007 Taylor & Francis\nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\nDOI: 10.1080\/17486700701371488\n*Corresponding author.

It is generally accepted that in\nthe majority of cases, Q10 lies between 2.0 and 3.0 [22] although it should be noted that Q10 is\nnot necessarily constant over the entire temperature range [37].\nIn contrast, there are some enzyme-controlled processes which display a much higher\ntemperature dependence, with Q10 . 3.0; see, for example, [2,8,25,35]; and some enzyme-\ncontrolled processes which are almost temperature independent (with Q10 < 1.0); see, for\nexample, [16,28,36]. In these temperature independent processes it may be the case that the\nindividual reactions display a strong temperature dependence [19,20,23,27,31,37], but that\ntheir combined action contains some adapting step so that the resulting process is virtually\ntemperature independent.\nThere have been numerous studies on the effects of temperature change upon\nliving organisms: how metabolism may be regulated via enzyme and protein adaptations\n[31\u201334,38,44], but to our knowledge there has been little theoretical investigation from the\ntraditional enzyme kinetics viewpoint into the mechanisms via which enzyme-controlled\nreactions compensate for temperature changes [9,11,17,40\u201342].\nThe main question we address in this study is how temperature changes can influence\nnetworks of enzyme reactions. There are many different and very complex mechanisms for\ntemperature control developed during evolution, especially in multicellular organisms.\nHowever, in this work, we suggest a mechanism via which a simple system (such as a protein\nnetwork) can operate as a temperature independent module even if \u201cparts\u201d of that module are\ntemperature dependent.\nInitially, we start with a model bienzyme system and show that the steady state\nconcentrations of reacting substrates are dependent on the ratios of the active enzyme\nconcentrations and rate constants. If the rate constants satisfy certain relationships then we\nshow that the system can be almost temperature independent. We illustrate this by considering\nsome commonly occurring bienzyme systems in more detail. In the second part of this article,\nwe apply similar techniques to chains of reversible and non-reversible reactions.\n2. Initial studies: simple bienzyme modules\nIn this section, we begin our study by considering the simplest kind of bienzyme modules.\nIn each case, an initial substrate (S1) will react with an initial enzyme (E1) to produce a\nsecond substrate (S2). This second substrate will react with a second enzyme (E2) to produce\neither a product (P) or the initial substrate (S1). We illustrate our findings with some\ncommonly occurring metabolic reactions.\n2.1 A non-reversible bienzyme module\nThe most simple non-reversible bienzyme module can be written as follows:\nS1 \u00fe E1O\nk1\nk21\nC1\u0001!k2 S2 \u00fe E1;\nS2 \u00fe E2O\nk3\nk23\nC2\u0001!k4 P\u00fe E2:\n\u00f01\u00de\nN.

It should be noted that the active\nconcentrations of enzymes can be regulated by factors such as temperature, pH, covalent\nmodification and external concentrations of activators and inhibitors [1,7]. Therefore, a sudden\nchange in temperature may cause a shift in the concentration of active enzyme.\nAssuming that the system is in a steady state we have\nc1 \u00bc s1e\nA\n1\nK1 \u00fe s1 and c2 \u00bc\ns2e\nA\n2\nK2 \u00fe s2 ; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere K1 and K2 are the standard Michaelis-Menten constants given by\nK1 \u00bc k21 \u00fe k2\nk1\nand K2 \u00bc k23 \u00fe k4\nk3\n: \u00f012\u00de\nThus, the steady state concentration of S2, given by s\n*\n2, satisfies the equation\ns*2 \u00bc\nK2\nA2\nA1\nK1\ns*\n1\n\u00fe 1\n\u0001 \u0002\n2 1\n; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere s*1 is the steady state concentration of S1 and Ai \u00bc k2ieAi for i \u00bc 1,2.

The above module and the corresponding biological assumptions\ncan be illustrated by considering a module involved in the regulation of cAMP concentration.\nThe metabolic module can be described as follows:\nATP \u00fe ACO\nk1\nk21\nATP2 AC\u0001!k2 cAMP \u00fe AC;\ncAMP \u00fe PDEO\nk3\nk23\ncAMP2 PDE\u0001!k4 MN \u00fe PDE;\n\u00f015\u00de\nwhere AC is Adenylate cyclase, the enzyme transforming Adenosintriphosphate (ATP) to\ncyclic Adenosinmonophosphate (cAMP) and PDE is Phosphodiestherase, the enzyme\ntransforming cAMP to Mononucleotide (MN).\nFrom Refs. [15,18,29], we have that:\n\u00bdATP\u00020 . 1023M .. 1024M $ k21 \u00fe k2\nk1\n\u00bc K1; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere [ATP]0 is the initial concentration of ATP. Applying equation (13) we can deduce that\nthe stationary concentration of cAMP is given approximately by\n\u00bdcAMP\u0002* \u00bc K2\nk4\u00bdPDE\u0002A\nk2\u00bdAC\u0002A 2 1\n; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere [PDE]A is the active concentration of PDE and K2 \u00bc \u00f0k23 \u00fe k4\u00de=k3. Thus, the\nstationary concentration of cAMP is a function of the ratio of AC and PDE activities and the\nrate constants.\nWhilst we expect the active enzyme concentrations to depend on temperature, there will\nalso be external factors that may change the number of active receptors. In the metabolic\nmodule considered above, changes in AC receptor concentration may be caused by the\npresence of adrenalin and the Cholera toxin [1].\n2.2 A reversible bienzyme system\nThe most simple reversible bienzyme reaction may be written in the following way:\nS1 \u00fe E1O\nk1\nk21\nC1\u0001!k2 S2 \u00fe E1;\nS2 \u00fe E01O\nk0\n3\nk0\n23\nC01\u0001!k\n0\n2\nS1 \u00fe E01:\n\u00f018\u00de\nThe end product is simply the initial substrate and hence the system differs little from that of\nsection 1 except that here we do not assume that S1 is held fixed.

If the concentration of S1 is\nchanged, the system will settle to a new steady state with an adjusted value of s01.\nFigure 2 shows plots of the steady state concentration of S2 as the rate constants k2 and k4\nare varied, in both the cases A01=A1 + 1. Although it appears as if there are two solutions for\ns*2 in each plot in figure 2, in fact only one of these will be feasible. In the case that A\n0\n1=A1 . 1\nthe positive square root will always give s*2 . s\n0\n1 which contradicts the initial conditions.\nIn the case that A01=A1 , 1 we must take the square root which results in a positive solution\nfor s*2. In each of the cases A\n0\n1=A1 + 1, we see results similar to the non-reversible case:\nincreasing k2 increases s\n*\n2 and vice versa for k4. Similar results hold for e\nA\n1 and e\nA\n2 but we do\nnot show them here.\n2.2.1 An example module. A widespread process that takes place in many living cells is\nphosphorylation\/dephosphorylation. Let us consider a bienzyme module that covalently\nmodifies some protein conformation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

We now discuss a\npossible mechanism for temperature compensation. To begin, we discuss the temperature\ndependence of the rate constants and enzyme activities.\n2.3.1 Dependence of rate constants on temperature. If we examine only temperature\nranges where protein denaturation is negligible, then the Arrhenius equation predicts the\nfollowing dependence of rate constant upon temperature:\nk \u00bc B exp 2 E\nRT\n\u0004 \u0005\n; \u00f026\u00de\nwhere B is a constant, E is the activation energy of the reaction, R is the gas constant and T is\nthe temperature (in Kelvin). Suppose that a simple substrate-enzyme reaction S \u00fe E! P has\nrate constants k^1, k2. Then the associated Michaelis Menten rate constant will be given by\nK \u00bc B21exp 2\nE21\nRT\n\u0006 \u0007\u00fe B2exp 2 E2RT\u0006 \u0007\nB1exp 2\nE1\nRT\n\u0006 \u0007 \u00f027\u00de\n) K \u00bc B21\nB1\nexp 2\n\u00f0E21 2 E1\u00de\nRT\n\b \t\n\u00fe B2\nB1\nexp 2\n\u00f0E2 2 E1\u00de\nRT\n\b \t\n: \u00f028\u00de\nAssuming that the activation energies, Ei, are similar then K will be virtually temperature\nindependent.\nFigure 3(a) shows a plot of the temperature dependence of a rate constant k according to\nthe Arrhenius equation. Figure 3(b) shows a plot of a Michaelis-Menten rate constant K with\neach of the constituent rate constants having Arrhenius temperature dependence. We see\nfrom figure 3(b) that a 108K change in temperature results in a change in K of about 1%,\ndemonstrating that with similar activation energies the Michaelis-Menten constant, and\nhence Q10, will be virtually temperature independent.\nThere are several examples in the literature where this phenomenon of temperature\nindependence of the Michaelis-Menten rate constants has been observed. For temperature\nindependence of the parameters in the ATP\/AC reaction of section 2.1.1 see, for example,\n[30,43] and for a phosphorylation reaction (as in section 2.2.1) see [31].\n2.3.2 Dependence of s*2 upon temperature. As was shown in section 2.3.1, if the activation\nenergies for two reactions are similar, or if the proteins are not labile with respect to\ntemperature, then the Michaelis-Menten constants are only weakly temperature dependent.\nIn this case the temperature dependence of s*2 comes from the ratio of A1 \u00bc k2eA1 and\nA2 \u00bc k4eA2 . We expect the rate constants k2 and k4 to follow the Arrhenius equation and eA1\nand eA2 to display a bell-shaped temperature dependence [3,10,12\u201314].\nFigure 4 shows the expected temperature dependence of s*2 in the non-reversible reaction\ngiven by equation (1) when A1 \u00bc k2eA1 and A2 \u00bc k4eA2 display similar temperature\nN.

In particular, it should be noted that although k2 and k4 are highly\ntemperature dependent, the resulting steady state value of S2 displays a much weaker\ntemperature dependence. In this way, we suggest a mechanism for achieving temperature\nregulation: suppose that we may write, for example,\nAi \u00bc f i\u00f0T; x\u00de; \u00f029\u00de\nwhere fi denotes the dependence of Ai upon temperature, T, and upon a vector, x, of other\nphysiological parameters. Then we can write\nAi\nAj\n\u00bc f i\u00f0T ; x\u00de\nf j\u00f0T ; x\u00de \u00bc f i; j\u00f0T; x\u00de: \u00f030\u00de\nOur mathematical analysis suggests that the steady state concentration of the second\nsubstrate S2 can be described as follows:\ns*2 \u00bc Q\u00bd f 2;1\u00f0T ; x\u00de\u0002; \u00f031\u00de\nfor some function Q. This analysis holds under certain parameter constraints\u2014whilst the\nMichaelis-Menten constants display weak temperature dependence\u2014and in both the non-\nreversible and reversible bienzyme systems. In this case\nds*2\ndT\n\u00bc Q0\u00bd f 2;1\u00f0T ; x\u00de\u0002 \u203af 2;1\u00f0T\u00de\n\u203aT\n: \u00f032\u00de\nIf the ratio of the Ai (A\n0\ni) involved displays little temperature dependence we will have\nj\u203af 2;1=\u203aTj ,, 1. Hence \u00f0ds*2=dt\u00de < 0 for suitably smooth functions Q and we see that s*2 will\nonly display a weak temperature dependence. It is in this way that we suggest a possible\nmechanism for temperature dependence: that is, if certain relationships between the reaction\nschemes and temperature dependencies of individual enzyme activities are satisfied. We note\nthat if the temperature of a system is changed then the results of section 2 only hold once the\nsystem has reached its new steady state.\n3.

Conclusions\nIn this paper, we used standard reaction kinetics and associated analysis to investigate the\ntemperature dependence of bienzyme modules and long enzymatic chains. Initial models\nshowed that under certain conditions the stationary states of bienzyme modules may be only\nweakly influenced by temperature, despite strong temperature dependence of the separate\nreactions, if the reaction rates and enzyme activities show similar temperature dependence.\nSubsequent models suggest a mechanism for temperature compensation in metabolic chains:\nnon-reversible chains showed a temperature dependence on only the first and final\ncomponents of the chain whilst reversible chains were shown to display a dependence on\nevery component.\nIt is important to note that in each case examined here, the system requires a transient\nperiod following each temperature change until it reaches a new steady state. The analysis\npresented here is not valid until the system reaches this steady state. It is also important to\nnote that the results only hold for proteins (substrates) which either do not denature\nsignificantly over the temperature range of interest, or which are not labile to temperature.\nN.

Movement is controlled by the beating of cilia arranged around the cell surface and the\nbiomolecular system understood to control cilia beat frequency in P. caudatum is presented\nin figure 5. This scheme is based on the data presented in several papers [4,5,21,24,26].\nWe note that the scheme shown in figure 5 includes several of the bienzyme modules\ndiscussed in section 2. Experimental data suggests that the individual Q10 for some of the\nindividual reactions involved in this scheme are as follows: Protein kinase, Q10 < 2:3 [6];\nPhosphatase, Q10 < 5:0 [35]; AC, Q10 < 2:52 3:0 [39].\nThe dependence of P. caudatum motion velocity upon temperature has been measured and\nthe results are shown in figure 6: for more details of the experimental procedures used in\ngathering these results see Appendix A. An estimate of the temperature coefficient, Q10, was\nobtained by considering cilia beat frequency, which itself determines P. caudatum movement\nvelocity. From figure 6, we estimate Q10 \u00bc 1.624, thereby illustrating that the metabolic\nscheme consisting of a combination of the bi-enzyme modules described above has a\ntemperature dependence that is lower than the temperature dependence of the individual\nmodules. This experimental result supports the theoretical predictions reported here.\n4.2 Discussion\nIt could be inferred that evolution has been directed to make the temperature dependencies of\nenzyme activities close to one another, hence providing a mechanism for compensating\nagainst the effects of temperature on some of the main cellular processes. At the same time\nthe dynamic behavior of the considered modules making up these processes remains strongly\ninfluenced by the temperature. These results are valid for a range of bienzyme systems: for\ncGMP metabolism; acetylation; adenylation; and the uridilation of proteins.\nThe results obtained here can be used in experimental studies of the temperature effects\nupon living biological systems. Our studies suggest that the effect of temperature upon\nsophisticated biological processes is determined not only by the presence or absence of\nFigure 5.

Some of the metabolites are\nthe signal agents: for example, cyclic nucleotides, hormones, calcium ions amongst others.\nIt is important to notice that the condition of similarity of enzymatic activities may not be\nvalid in the whole physiological temperature range. This in particular can be true in the case\nof cold-blooded animals, due to the structural differences of enzymes forming the bienzyme\nmodule. To adapt to wider temperature ranges evolution might have selected two or more\nisoforms of the same enzyme with different temperature dependencies [22]. This type of\nadaptation is connected with the change in gene expression; therefore it is quite slow and not\nconsidered here.\nHaving said that, the body temperature of cold-blooded animals can vary over a wide\nrange, whereas in the case of warm-blooded animals the temperature only changes by a few\ndegrees, yet animals remain alive despite these changes. We speculate that the usage of\nbienzyme modules and non-reversible enzymatic reactions allows for some temperature\ncompensation: it is therefore possible that a system that has highly temperature dependent\ncomponents is almost temperature independent. We speculate that on time scales shorter than\nthe times required for changes in gene expression, the usage of such modules is sufficient to\ncompensate for the strong temperature dependence of individual enzymes.\nAcknowledgements\nREB would like to thank the London Mathematical Society for a Small Collaborative Grant\nto visit the Laboratory of Bionics and Biophysics, Kazan State University, Lloyds\nTercentenary Foundation for a Lloyds Tercentenary Foundation Fellowship, Research\nFigure 6.

The dependence of P. caudatum motion velocity upon\ntemperature calculated by this method is shown in figure 6.\nN. V. Kotov et al.110\nD\now\nnl\noa\nde\nd \nBy\n: [\nBa\nke\nr, \nR\n.
