China\nAbstract Nonlinearities in aircraft mechanisms are inevitable, especially in the control\nsystem. It\u2019s necessary to investigate the effects of them on the dynamic response and control\nperformance of aeroelastic system. In this paper, based on the state-dependent Riccati\nequation method, a state feedback suboptimal control law is derived for aeroelastic response\nand flutter suppression of a three degree-of-freedom typical airfoil section. With the control\nlaw designed, nonlinear effects of freeplay in the control surface and time delay between the\ncontrol input and actuator are investigated by numerical approach. A cubic nonlinearity in\npitch degree is adopted to prevent the aeroelastic responses from divergence when the flow\nvelocity exceeds the critical flutter speed. For the system with a freeplay, the responses of\nboth open- and closed-loop systems are determined with Runge-Kutta algorithm in\nconjunction with Henon\u2019s method. This method is used to locate the switching points\naccurately and efficiently as the system moves from one subdomain into another. The\nsimulation results show that the freeplay leads to a forward phase response and a slight\nincrease of flutter speed of the closed-loop system. The effect of freeplay on the aeroelastic\nresponse decreases as the flow velocity increases.

Introduction\nDue to various nonlinearities, aeroelastic systems exhibit a variety of phenomena such as limit cycle\noscillation and chaotic vibration [1-3]. Flutter instability can jeopardize aircraft structure and its performance.\nA great deal of research activity devoted to flutter control of aeroelastic system has been accomplished.\nKurdila et al. [4] gave an extensive review of nonlinear control methods for high-energy limit-cycle\noscillations. Mukhopadhyay [5] presented an historical perspective on analysis and control of aeroelastic\nresponses. In recent years, a large number of control strategies have been developed for the flutter\nsuppression [6-14, 16, 17], such as adaptive decoupled fuzzy sliding-mode control [6], and tensor-product\nmodel-based control [7]. In Ref. 7, parameter-varying state-space model was transformed into the tensor-\nproduct model whereupon linear matrix inequality techniques in the parallel distributed compensation design\nframework can be executed to define controller. As an extension of Ref. 7, an observer was derived via\nLMI-based design to estimate the practically unmeasurable state values from the output values [8]. A\nmultiple-input and multiple-output adaptive control law was designed via both leading and trailing edge\ncontrol surfaces [9]. For the two-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic system with uncertainties, many effective\nadaptive control laws were designed by Singh et al. [10-14]. Mracek et al. [15] carried out a control design of\nthe nonlinear benchmark problem using the state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) method. Then SDRE\ncontrol technique was developed to design suboptimal control laws for nonlinear aeroelastic systems [16-17].\nTime delays in control loops are inevitable because of the dynamics involved in the actuators, sensors,\nand controllers [18], and are prevalent when digital controllers, analogue anti-aliasing and reconstruction\nfilters, and hydraulic actuators were used [19]. Time delay feedback control has received much attention\nrecent years [20]. Chaotic motions of a two-dimensional airfoil are controlled by the application of the\ntime-delayed continuous feedback method of Pyragas in Ref. [21]. Four control strategies are implemented\nwith plunging displacement, plunging velocity and pitching angle, pitching velocity. It showed that the\n4feedback control signal derived from the pitching variables was more effective in controlling the chaotic\nmotion of the airfoil. Time delay effects on linear\/nonlinear feedback control of simple aeroelastic system\nwere presented by Marzocca et al. [22]. In Yu et al. [23], the problem of implications of time delay feedback\ncontrol of a two-dimensional supersonic lifting surface on flutter boundary is addressed. And they pointed\nout that we should apply both linear and nonlinear controls with small time delay, and avoid using plunging\ndisplacement controls. Zhao [18] presented a systematic study on aeroelastic stability of a two-dimensional\nairfoil with a single or multiple time delays in the feed back control loops. On the other side, time delay\nbetween the control input and actuators is unavoidable, and should be taken into account in the process of the\ncontrol of aeroelastic system. As indicated in Ref. [22], the actuators may input energy at the moment when\nthe controlled system does not need it. These delays can be very detrimental in the sense of impairing the\ncontrol performance and can even cause irregular motions, producing instability. So it is of interest to\ninvestigate the effect of time delay on an aeroelastic system.\nA state-space linear model with control input of a typical three degrees-of-freedom airfoil section was\ndeveloped by Edwards et al. [24]. Conner et al. [25] successfully adapted the model to investigate the effect\nof structural freeplay on an open-loop system response in numerical and experimental approach. In previous\nresearch, the flutter control was studied without considering nonlinearity such as freeplay in the control\nsurface [6-17]. In the current paper, freeplay nonlinearity in the control surface has been considered in the\ndesign of a state feedback control law for flutter suppression. With the control law designed, the effect of\ncontrol surface freeplay on the dynamic response and flutter suppression have been investigated. In addition,\nthe effect of time delay between the actuator control input and the control surface action is also investigated.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the aeroelastic equation and control\nproblem. A feedback control law is designed in Section 3. Section 4 shows simulation results and discussion.\nConclusions are presented in Section 5.\n2. Equations of Motion and Control Problem\nA typical airfoil section with a trailing edge control surface is normally simplified and modelled as a three\ndegrees-of-freedom system as illustrated in Fig. 1 for aeroelastic analysis [25]. The three degrees of freedom\nof the model include plunge h, pitch \uf061, and control surface angle \uf062. The elastic axis is located at a distance\nab from the mid-chord. The airfoil mass center is located at a distance x b\uf061 from the elastic axis, where b is\n5the semi-chord of the airfoil section. Both distances are positive when measured towards the airfoil trailing\nedge.

Numerical instability may occur unless the switching points are\nlocated accurately. Based on the work done by Henon [31] and Conner et al.

Then, the altered system (24) can be integrated using the distance from the current\n9control surface position to the boundary that has been crossed as step size. The result of Henon integration\ncan be used as the initial condition to integrate the original state equation in a new subdomain until the next\nboundary is crossed.\n4. Results and Discussion\nNumerical simulation results are presented in this section. A small time step of 0.0001s is set in the\nprocess of numerical integration. The values for the system parameters are taken from Ref. [25] and listed as\nfollows: a = -0.5, b = 0.127m, c = 0.5, s = 0.52m, mT = 1.2895 kg, I\uf061\uf020= 0.01347 kg.m2, I\uf062\uf020= 0.0003264 kg.m2,\nx\uf061\uf020\uf020= 0.434, x\uf062\uf020\uf020= 0.01996, kh = 2818.8 N\/m, S\uf061\uf020= 0.08587 kg.m, S\uf062\uf020= 0.00395 kg.m, \uf072\uf020= 1.225 kg\/m3,\n1 0.01626\uf056 \uf03d , 2 0.0115\uf056 \uf03d , 3 0.0113\uf056 \uf03d . The nonlinear parameter in pitch stiffness is \uf067\uf020= 3.\n4.1 Open-loop system response with freeplay nonlinearity\nStarting from the open-loop stability study of the aeroelastic system, the system response keeps stable\nuntil the velocity reaches U = 23.96 m\/s when no freeplay exists. However, the system with freeplay exhibits\nlimit cycle oscillation at about U = 6.0 m\/s, which is relative to the initial conditions used in the simulation.\nTo study the effect of control surface freeplay nonlinearity on the open-loop system response, the two values\nof freeplay \uf064\uf020= 1.0o and \uf064\uf020= 2.0o were chosen in this case to compare with the \uf064\uf020= 0o non-freeplay system.\nFlow velocity below the non-freeplay system flutter speed With the flow velocity U = 5.0 m\/s, both\nfreeplay and non-freeplay systems are stable. From Fig. 3, it can be observed that the freeplay system\nresponse needs more time to converge. In addition, the response amplitude is obviously bigger than the\nnon-freeplay system. At flow velocity U = 10.0 m\/s, the freeplay system response become limit cycle\noscillation while the non-freeplay system remains stable as shown in Fig. 4. The control surface response\namplitude is slightly larger than the freeplay magnitude. However the freeplay magnitude has little influence\non the critical flutter velocity of the system. The system pitch and plunge amplitudes with \uf064\uf020= 2.0o are twice\nlarger than the amplitudes with \uf064\uf020= 1.0o.\nFlow velocity above the non-freeplay system flutter speed At the flow velocity U = 25.0 m\/s, Fig. 5\nshows that the aeroelastic response of non-freeplay system becomes limit cycle oscillation. The response of\nfreeplay system is also under limited amplitude, but not divergent, although the flow velocity is beyond the\nnon-freeplay critical flutter speed. It indicates that the cubic nonlinearity in pitch may transform the freeplay\nsystem response from divergent motion to a limit cycle oscillation with limited amplitude. The freeplay\n10\nsystem responses in pitch and plunge are similar to harmonic motions with slightly larger amplitudes than the\nnon-freeplay system responses. However, there is an obvious difference between the freeplay and non-\nfreeplay control surface deflections as shown in Fig. 5.b. Frequency analysis of the control surface responses\nshow that the first vibration mode component (6.0 Hz) is dominant in the non-freeplay flap response (Fig.\n6.a), while the third vibration mode component (18.0 Hz) make more contribution when the freeplay exists in\nthe control surface (Fig. 6.b). If flow velocity is continuously increased up to U = 30.0 m\/s, the third\nvibration mode component (18.9 Hz) will take important role in both cases as shown in Fig. 6.c and 6.d. So\nthe freeplay system has almost the same motion as non-freeplay system except for the phase advance as\nshown in Fig. 7.a.\nAs the existence of freeplay, the stiffness of the connection between main airfoil and control surface is\nreduced. When the main airfoil vibrates, the control surface is motivated through the freeplay connection.\nThe lower connection stiffness will postpone the control surface response. But in the current case of\nself-excited vibration under unsteady aerodynamics, the freeplay system is easier to be excited and more\nsensitive to the aerodynamics. Figure 7.b shows the phase transformation process in the time history of\ncontrol surface deflection. It shows the non-freeplay system response is forward in phase at the beginning\nuntil the unsteady aerodynamics become dominant in the vibration.\nThe analysis above indicates that the effect of freeplay on aeroelastic response is reducing as the\ndeflection amplitude of the control surface alone with the flow velocity increases. From Fig. 2, it is noted\nthat when the control surface deflection is small, the freeplay is dominant in the relationship between torque\nand the deflection. However, if the control surface deflects with larger amplitude, the linear component will\nbecome dominant. In other words, the freeplay nonlinearity has less effect and the system behaves more like\na non-freeplay system as the amplitude increases.\n4.2 Closed-loop system response with freeplay nonlinearity\nIn the following closed-loop situation, state coefficient matrix Q in performance index is chose as a 8*8\nunit matrix, and control input coefficient r = 100. To study the effect of control surface freeplay nonlinearity\non the closed-loop system response, the value \uf064\uf020= 2.0o was chosen in this case to compare with the \uf064\uf020= 0o\nnon-freeplay system. The simulation was first performed with the flow velocity U = 24.0 m\/s, which is above\nboth freeplay and non-freeplay critical flutter speed. As shown in Fig. 8, after initial oscillatory transients the\nplunge and pitch states converge to zero in about two seconds. There is no obvious difference between the\n11\nfreeplay and non-freeplay system responses. At a higher flow velocity U = 32.0 m\/s, a faster response time of\nless than one second was obtained and shown in Fig. 9. The freeplay response maximum amplitude is\nobviously higher. The freeplay states take more time to converge to zero after the transient oscillation, which\nbehaves like a response of an overdamping system. Given the initial condition of \uf061\uf028\uf030\uf029\uf020= 0.1 rad and the other\nvariables zero, the closed-loop system will keep stable until the flow velocity reaches 84.3 m\/s. While the\nfreeplay system (\uf064\uf020\uf020= 2.0o) will show limit cycle oscillation when the flow velocity U > 86.7 m\/s.\nIf the control input was triggered after the system had exhibited limit cycle oscillation, the closed-loop\ncritical flutter speed would drop down at a lower value as a bigger control input would be required to\nsuppress the limit cycle oscillation than the initial disturbance. For example, the critical flutter speed of the\nsystem without freeplay was reduced from 84.3 m\/s to 27.3 m\/s. While the freeplay (\uf064\uf020= 2.0o) led to a slight\nincrease of the flutter speed to 27.6 m\/s. This is because the freeplay makes the control surface hinge\nstiffness decrease. So the control surface is easier to be actuated to follow the control input. A comparison of\nthe closed-loop responses at U = 27.4 m\/s are shown in Fig. 10, where the controller is triggered at time t =\n2s after the system exhibited limit cycle oscillation. It shows that the closed-loop response without freeplay\nis in limit cycle oscillation with reduced amplitude, while the response with freeplay actually converges.\n4.3 Closed-loop system response with time delay\nIn this section, the freeplay nonlinearity is ignored. Thus the standard 4-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, in\nstead of the Henon\u2019s method is used in the integrating process. The cubic nonlinearity in pitch is preserved to\nprevent the system response from divergence. In this case, the simulation was conducted at the flow velocity\nbelow and above the critical flutter speed.\nSystem response below the flutter speed First a comparison was made between the open- and closed-loop\nsystem responses at U =10.0 m\/s without any time delay. From the results shown in Fig. 11, it can be\nobserved that the control law designed in section 3 makes the plunge of the closed-loop system converge\nmuch faster than the open-loop system. There is no obvious difference in the pitch response. If a time delay \uf074\nbetween the control input and actuator occurred at time t, the control input \uf062c\uf020(t-\uf074) would be derived from the\nprevious state X(t-\uf074) at time \uf074 before the present state. The control input \uf062c\uf020(t-\uf074) would drive the system\nbased on the state X(t-\uf074) including deflection \uf062\uf020(t-\uf074), which would cause oscillations of the system state and\ncontrol input. It can be observed that this vibration was convergent in the beginning. When \uf074 >0.3 ms, a\nhigh-frequency vibration of small amplitude arose in the control input \uf062c (t), but the vibration is convergent.\n12\nUntil \uf074 \u22651.1ms, the vibration becomes divergent. Here, the control input was limited to a range of deflection \nangle \u00b120o. The control input time histories of the close-loop system for three typical time delay sizes were\nshown in Fig. 12. From the analysis results, it was also found that the time delay will produce an additional\nmotion in the system responses. Given \uf074 =2.0ms as an example as shown in Fig. 13, a high-frequency\nvibration with little amplitude occurred in company with the main vibration.\nSystem response above the flutter speed When the flow velocity was above the system flutter speed, a\ncontrol law was designed to keep the system response convergent. If a time delay was set between the\ncontrol input and actuator however, the system response behaved differently. For example, the closed-loop\ncritical flutter speed decreased from U = 84.3 m\/s to 47.0 m\/s when a time delay of \uf074 = 2.0 ms was set in the\nsystem. The system responses at U = 60.0 m\/s in terms of pitch angle and plunge displacement are shown in\nFig. 14. It is obvious that the pitch and plunge responses with the time delay does not converge.\nIf the time delay was further increased, the designed control law would completely invalid. The system\nexhibit limit cycle oscillations even the flow velocity is much lower than open-loop critical flutter speed\n(23.96 m\/s). For example, with the time delay \uf074 =10.0ms, two typical vibration styles are performed for U =\n10.0 m\/s and U = 25.0 m\/s. At the flow velocity U = 10.0 m\/s below the open-loop critical flutter speed, the\ntime history and phase diagram results of the system are shown in Fig. 15. The phase diagrams and Poincare\nsection indicate that the motion is quasi-periodic. At the flow velocity U = 25.0 m\/s above the open-loop\ncritical flutter speed, the phase diagrams of pitch and plunge responses are shown in Fig. 16. The system\nresponse becomes more complex than common quasi-periodic motion. But in fact, the Poincare sections in\ncircles indicate that the motion remains as quasi-periodic motion. The study results indicate that the time\ndelay between the control input and actuator may jeopardize the performance of a carefully designed control\nlaw, and cause instability of the system.\nKeep the flow speed U = 25.0 m\/s, bifurcation diagrams of closed-loop system response as function of\ntime delay are given in Fig. 17. From Fig. 17.a, we can see that the system shows limit cycle oscillation after\na supercritical Hopf bifurcation at about \uf074 =1.2 ms. However, the amplitudes of pitch and plunge responses\nare quite small until the time delay is higher than 4.0 ms. Which means that a quite small time delay may\nlead to system instability, but the control law designed is still effective to depress the flutter. With the time\ndelay increasing, closed-loop response amplitudes become large rapidly. At \uf074 =10 ms, the pitch and plunge\namplitudes are almost the same with open-loop response amplitudes. And now the control law has not any\neffectiveness for flutter control.\n13\n5. Conclusions\nBased on the state space model of a three degrees-of-freedom airfoil section with freeplay nonlinearity, a\nsuboptimal control law was designed by using the state-dependent Riccati equation method and applied for\ndynamic response suppression in this paper. In the model, a cubic nonlinearity term was adopted to prevent\nthe aeroelastic response from divergence when the flow velocity is beyond the system critical flutter speed.\nThe effects of both control surface freeplay and time delay between the control input and actuator on the\naeroelastic responses have been investigated. The Henon\u2019s method was employed to locate the switching\npoints in the procedure of Runge-Kutta numerical integration.\nBecause the linear component in the control surface response amplitude increases and becomes dominant,\nthe effect of freeplay on the system response reduces as the flow velocity increases. In addition, the freeplay\nshows some beneficial effect on the aeroelastic stability of the closed-loop system. Due to the freeplay, the\nsystem response has a forward phase than the non-freeplay system response. The system response is sensitive\nto the time delay between the control input and actuator. The bifurcation diagram of system response as\nfunction of time delay indicates that a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurred with a small time delay, which\nleads to high-frequency vibration. And with the time delay increasing, the system responses become\nquasi-periodic motions. It should be noted that the effect of time delay on the system response depends upon\nthe control law designed in this paper. With alternative control laws, the system dynamic response might\nexhibit different phenomena. In a more realistic model, the actuator stiffness and damping should be taken\ninto account in the controller design.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the EC funding for the EU FP7 collaborative project SADE and\nthe National Nature Science Grant of P.R.
