Introduction \nControl measures to restrict sulphur (S) emissions were put in place in the 1980s. Between \n1986 and 2002, emission reductions in the UK were dramatic, down from almost 2000 kt S to \n< 600 kt S [1]. Sulphur deposition in the UK has also fallen, although by proportionally less \nthan would be expected from the fall in emissions, because of the nonlinearities in source \nreceptor relationships for S and N compounds [1].  Not withstanding this, the ratio of S to N \nhas gone down, and yet we know little about the consequences of these ratio changes for our \nforests.  Particularly pertinent questions that need addressing are: to what extent has acidified \nS deposition modified the effects of N deposition to forests and, what changes are involved in \nrecovery?  \nThe implications of changes in the ratio of acidified S to N for forests have not been \nwidely investigated in the field and remain poorly characterised.  Sheppard [2], Sheppard and \nCrossley [3] and Sheppard et al [4,5]  treated young Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Bong. \nCarr.), growing on an organo-mineral soil, with S and N and combinations: ammonium nitrate \n(NH4NO3), with and without sulphuric acid (H2SO4 at pH 2.5), and sodium sulphate \n(Na2SO4).  In five years, stemwood quadrupled but the growth was heterogeneous with less \nthan 30% being explained by the simulated anthropogenic deposition. Nitrogen additions of \n48 kg N ha-1 y-1 did enhance stemwood increments but the 20% increase over 5 years was only \njust significant (P< 0.05). The inclusion of acidity with N, even at double the acid + N dose, \nmade no difference [5]. These observations suggested that neither enhanced N nor acidified S \ndeposition pose a potential threat to the growth of young Sitka, at least in the short-term. \n However, tree growth does not appear to be overly sensitive to N deposition. Wright \nand Rasmussen [6] concluded that effects of N deposition were strongly dependent on site \ntype (soil chemistry and climate) and the developmental stage of the stand.   The stand \nreported in Sheppard et al [5] was in the exponential growth phase leading up to canopy \nclosure and would have been expected to have a high N demand. Sigurgeirsson [7] suggests \n 3\nthat N inputs, similar to the single N dose (48 kg N ha-1 y-1) used in [5], are mostly retained by \nthe soil and thus would be unlikely to significantly influence tree growth over the short-term. \nEmmett [8] also suggests that N inputs below 60 kg N ha-1 y-1 take several years to change \ngrowth.   \n  Short-term experiments, <5 year minimum, cannot therefore be relied on to predict the \npotential impacts of enhanced acid and N deposition on tree growth, even when there are \nchanges in foliar and soil chemistry [9]. It is also possible, when considering the combined \neffects of N and acidity, that the acid an d N effects cancel each other out. The capacity of tree \ngrowth to buffer change should not be underestimated. Sheppard et al [5] showed no growth \neffect at double the acid + N dose, despite significant increases in litterfall and canopy \ntransparency and lowered foliar P and Mg status.  Innes [10] reports minimal growth effects \nuntil > 50% of the tree needles have been lost or damaged. \n  The issue of what to measure to assess the effect of acid deposition on N availability is \ncomplex, reflecting the temporal nature of effects, which in turn depend on each systems \ncapacity to buffer the chemical changes and previous deposition history [11]. The Sheppard et \nal [5] study identified the responsiveness, rates and magnitudes, of different parts of the \nsystem to acidic S and N deposition and found that soil water N and S increased significantly \nas did the fine roots, which are in direct contact with the soil solution. The saprophyte \ncommunity, which is coupled to litter and throughfall chemistry responded over a similar \ntime-scale while the ectomycorrhizal community, buffered via the trees carbon supply [11], \ntook longer. Amongst the slowest responding parts of the system studied by Sheppard et al [5] \nwere foliar nutrient concentrations. Foliar N failed to register a significant change for annual \nN inputs of 48 kg N ha-1 y-1 over the 5 treatment years, though did show a significant albeit \nsmall increase (<20% ) in response to 96 kg N ha-1 y-1. Response times may be related to the \nsizes of the soil N pools [12] but these were not quantified.  \n 4\nQuestions concerning sustainability, how long sites can continue to buffer \nanthropogenic inputs, or recover if inputs decline therefore remain highly topical as so few \nexperiments extend beyond 3-5 years, typical grant lengths. The relevance of historical S \nloadings on N use is still important because unlike S emissions, N emissions have not fallen in \nrecent years, in the UK [13]. \n This paper reports on a three year extension of the experiment of Sheppard et al [5] \nwhich, in addition to evaluating the temporal aspects of the ecosystem response to acidified S \nand N additions, by maintaining the original treatments to half the plots, also examined the \npotential for recovery, by the removal of sulphuric acid, sodium sulphate and ammonium \nnitrate constituents. The aims were to: \n1. Evaluate above and below-ground responses to the combination of sulphuric acid and \nN additions to assess the influence of acidified S on N responses. \n2. Assess the rate of responsiveness of ecosystem recovery to the removal of acidified S, \nN or a combination of the two. \n2. Methods \n2.1 Site Description \nTable 1 near here \nThe site was located within a young commercially managed Sitka spruce plantation, planted \nin 1986, in the Scottish Borders, 20 km S. W. of Edinburgh (290 m above sea level at latitude \n55046\u2019N and longitude 3018\u2019W on an organo-mineral soil, < pH 3.0 in CaCl2). The study area \ncomprised 1.5 ha of trees, approximately 2 m apart on mounds formed, from the inversion of \n0.7 m of peat, litter and small but variable amounts of mineral soil, when drainage furrows \nwere created using a double moleboard plough. This intervention created considerable plot to \nplot variability in soil properties due to the different amounts of mineral soil turned over by \nthe plough [2,5]. \n2.1 Treatments \n 5\nTwo plots (selected at random, irrespective of block) were maintained on the original \ntreatment, and the other two had an element of the treatment removed to simulate reductions \nin emission\/deposition, as shown in table 1. The maintained treatments provided 50 kg ha-1 y-1 \nand 48 kg ha-1 y-1 of S and N respectively, or twice those doses, at a maximum ionic strength \nof 1.6 or 3.2 mM.  The double dose was achieved by doubling the spraying frequency over the \nannual spray period, between May and November.  In the \u2018recovery\u2019 plots the N and S were \nwithheld from the rainwater and H2SO4 (SAc) was withheld from the NSAcid (NSAc) and \n2NSAcid (2NSAc) treatments to leave only Nr or 2Nr. The new treatment regime was \nimplemented in 2001, 2002 and 2003 (table 1).   \nThe amount of treatment applied per spray event was equivalent to 2mm precipitation, just \nsufficient to wet the canopy but not the soil.  Treatments supplied an additional 10% \nprecipitation over the year.  The trees were sprayed at a pressure of 1.5 bar with droplets of \nbetween 100 and 250 \u03bcm in diameter.  The galvanised steel scaffolding (13m x 5m) supported \nthe 24 full cone sprayer units.   \n2.2 Treatment periods and environmental parameters \n The spraying schedule in relation to rainfall and soil temperature, 0-5 cm depth is given in \nTable 1. Treatments generally began in May preceding budburst. In 2001 and 2002 all the \ntreatment was applied, compared to the final year when the \u2018drought\u2019 led to only sufficient \nrainfall being available to apply 75% of the treatment. Soil water collections corresponded to \nthe start and finish of spraying, and winter no spray periods. Rainfall was based on a tipping \nbucket and together with soil temperature was measured about 1 mile north of the forest, \nacross the moor. Mean soil temperatures over the spray and winter periods varied by < 1oC \n(table 1). Rainfall varied hugely from ~ normal in 2001 to very wet in 2002 to dry in 2003 \n(table 1).  \n \n \n 6\n2.3 Measurements   \nStem area was measured annually at breast height to calculate stem area increment (SAI).    \nFor foliar chemistry, several two-year-old shoots were removed annually from the upper third \nof each tree in January, bulked by plot, separated into current and one year old shoots, dried, \nthe needles separated and ground [5].  N and S were measured with a CNS analyzer (Vario-\nEL elemental analyzer) and P, K, Ca and Mg in a modified Kjeldahl digest and analysed in a \n1% sulphuric acid on a Perkin Elmer 4300DV ICP-OES at a UKAS accredited laboratory. \nLitter was collected twice a year from 1m2 of guttering, which was also used to collect \nthroughfall [13] in the first year of treatment change.  Soil water was collected with zero-\ntension lysimeters [4].  One or two samples were collected for the winter period and between \n2 and 4 over the treatment period.  Field samples were preserved using thymol.  Volumes \ncollected decreased significantly as the trees closed canopy.  Soil cores, 4 from the middle of \neach plot were removed, using a bulb planter, for assessment of fine roots and mycorrhizal \ninfection and assessed at 2 depths. A separate assessment was also conducted to examine the \nC:N ratio of the litter.  Plot soil chemistry was assessed for the organic litter layer and the Ao \nhorizon, 0-10 cm of peat, separately for the ridge and undisturbed area between the two lines \nof trees, in March 2003 on bulk samples each representing 10 cores.  pH was measured using \n1:2.5 vol.: vol. in deionised H2O and 0.01M CaCl2 on fresh soil before the soil samples were \nair dried, sieved, remaining fine roots removed and ground. Cation exchange and \nexchangeable cations, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Mn and Al were measured in 0.5M BaCl2 and the \nmetals analysed on a Perkin-Elmer PE4300DV ICP-OES. \n2.4 Statistics \n The N, S, SAc and 2SAc removal treatments were evaluated against their original treatment \npairs for the 3 year period.  Data were analysed using Genstat 6 for Window\u2019s, one-way \nANOVA, no blocking and using plot moisture as a covariate, because of its highly significant \ncorrelation with growth over the previous 5 years [5].  Residuals were checked for normality \n 7\nand data transformed as necessary.  Where the treatment effects were significant (P< 0.05) \nFishers least significant difference test was used to separate the means. \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Tree growth, recovery from SAc and responses to N and timescale issues \nTable 2  near here \n \nOver the eight growing seasons of this experiment (1996-2003) annual relative SAI declined \nfrom > 60 % to < 10% as the trees, planted in 1986, reached canopy closure with an average \narea of 140 cm2 tree-1 at breast height and a predicted yield class of > 28. Treatment effects \nremain relatively modest (figure 1). N availability continued to exert a relatively small \ninfluence on SAI at this site, although the smaller SAI in response to N removal, indicates the \nadditional N was beneficial. The removal of acidity and S did not significantly change growth \nincrements (table 2).  The trees, in their exponential growth phase, responded positively to N \nbut in the presence of large amounts of acidity the N response was overridden by \u2018other\u2019 \ninfluences.  The addition of the spray, ~ 10 % additional precipitation, to the canopy over the \ngrowing period had a significant (P< 0.05) detrimental effect on growth (table 3).   \nTable  3near here \nFigure 1 near here \n \n3.2 Treatment effects on needle weights \nFigure2 near here \nPlot to plot variation in needle weight was high and no significant treatment effects were \nfound.  The one year old needles were almost 50% heavier than current year needles (figure \n2). Over the three years of recovery needle weights declined, -15%, in the control plots. For \ncurrent and one year needles, the removal of acidity tended to increase needle weights.  \n 8\n3.3 Responses of nutrient concentrations in current and one year old needles \n In this field study, the treatments were applied to the canopy, enabling potential canopy as \nwell as below-ground interactions. The needle weight and nutrient concentration data has \nbeen presented for the recovery treatment years and for the preceding year, when the \nreplicates received the original treatments. Differences in needle weight can influence foliar \nnutrient concentrations [14].  In good growing years and \/ or mild winters, such as 1999\/2000 \n(pre-recovery), large amounts of non-structural carbohydrate can accumulate, serving to dilute \nnutrient concentrations, which are expressed per dry weight. The original and recovery \ntreatment pairs often started at different weights or nutrient concentrations (figures 2,3).  To \nidentify trends in the recovery treatments and divergence from the original treatment, linear \nfits to the 4 data points have been included when the R2 exceeded 0.9. \nFigure3 near here \n \n Mg concentrations, in both needle age classes, were significantly affected by the treatments \n(P< 0.05).  In current year needles, acidity reduced Mg concentrations in proportion to dose, \nminus ~ 15 or 30% respectively over the 3 years relative to the control. Neither S nor N alone \nsignificantly affected Mg concentrations. Removing acidity almost restored Mg \nconcentrations to those of the control. However, recovery was much slower in the double acid \ntreatments (figure 3).   \n In one year old needles the double acid treatment significantly lowered %Mg. \nRemoval of acidity had no effect at either dose (figure 3). N and S treatments had small \npositive effects on the Mg status of one year old needles, relative to the control, which was \nabsent in the recovery treatments. The removal of S (Na2SO4) caused Mg concentrations to \nfall (figure 3). \n Ca concentrations were not significantly affected by treatment (P>0.05) for either age class \nof needles.  In both current and one year old needles Ca concentrations declined over the \n 9\ntreatment period by ~ 40%, down from 0.25 % and 0.45% respectively. Removal of acidity \nslowed down the Ca decline (figure 3).  \nK concentrations (data not shown) were not significantly affected by treatment, but in both \nyear classes of needles the additional wetting of the canopy lowered %K by  ~ 25% below \nthose in needles from unsprayed control trees. Mean K concentrations for all treatments were \n0.28, 0.34, 0.29 and 0.33% in prerecovery and recovery years 2001, 2002 and 2003 \nrespectively for current year needles, and 0.26, 0.27, 0.26 and 0.26 % in one year old needles.  \nS concentrations (data not shown) were not significantly affected by treatment (P> 0.05). \nMean concentrations for all treatments increased from year to year: 0.09, 0.1, 0.11, 0.12 %S \nand 0.09, 0.11, 0.12, 0.14 %S in new and one year old needles respectively.  \nP concentrations for all treatments showed almost no annual or treatment variability and \naveraged 0.12% P in current and 0.11% P in one year old needles.   \nN concentrations in current year needles were increased by treatments containing N by \ncomparison with the control, significantly in recovery year 2 (P= 0.051, <0.001, 0.18 \nrespectively) (figure 3).  Removal of acidity increased foliar N concentrations.    Removal of \nN caused % N to decrease.  In 2003, foliar N concentrations were noticeably higher than \nprevious years, in the treatments received N, especially where acid was removed from the \ndouble acid treatment. Similar but mainly none significant treatment trends were seen in one \nyear old needles (figure 3).  In year three the increase in N status in response to the removal of \nthe double acid dose was significant with respect to the control.   \n \n3.4 Changes in litterfall \nFigure 4 near here \n \nPrior to implementing the recovery treatments there were differences (none-significant) \nbetween the treatment pairs, especially for the 2NS Acid treatment (figure 4). Between \n 10\nseasons 2001 and 2003 the effects of treatment recovery on litter weights were small and non-\nsignificant. In 2000 the average litter loss was high ranging from 300 gm \u20132 in most plots, and \nup to 750 g m2 in the double acid + N treatment, but proceeded to stabilize in subsequent \nyears as more of the plots reached canopy closure.  \n3.5 Effects of recovery treatments on forest floor litter accumulation, litter pH and N \nconcentrations and fine root mass and N concentration \nTabl 4  near here \n \n After two treatment seasons\u2019 removal of acidity was reflected in litter pH, but not \nsignificantly (table 4).  The weight of the litter layer, was reduced when acid was removed, \nsignificantly so in the double acid plots (table 4). C:N ratios (table 4) were all >30, just above \nthe critical ratio of 25-27 indicating N saturation [15].  There were no significant treatment \neffects on litter N (P=0.21). Litter N concentrations were >40% higher than N concentrations \nin the live foliage and the N treatments increased litter N by ~ 10%. The removal of acidity \nhad a positive though non-significant effect on fine root mass, whereas removing N reduced \nfine root mass.  The +N treatments contained most fine roots. Concentrations of N in the fine \nroots exceeded those in the foliage by > 40%. Fine root N concentrations were not \nsignificantly affected by any treatment (table 4), but were higher in the single acid treatment \nwhen acidity was removed. Nitrogen removal did not affect fine root N concentrations.  \n  \n3.6 Treatment effects on Ectomycorrhizas (ECM) fruitbody numbers and root morphotypes \nTable 5 near here \n \nFruitbody numbers were significantly lower where the original treatments contained N, except \nwhen the N was applied with acid at the single N+ acid dose (table 5), particularly those of \nLactarius rufus.  Numbers of the smaller Inocybe were also low, as were numbers of \nsaprophytic fruiting bodies in these treatments (table 5).  Of the saprophytic fruitbodies, \nMycena spp. were most sensitive to acidic conditions, being absent from the acid plots (table \n 11\n5).  There was no significant recovery in fruitbody numbers in response to two years of acid \nor N removal.  \nTable 6  near here \n \nProportions of root with the Tylospora morphotype were greatest in the N plots, which \nhad least Lactarius rufus (table 6).  Depth sampling showed that proportions of Tylospora \nmorphotypes were greater in the 0-5 cm layer, whereas ECMs of L. rufus. Cortinarius and \nInocybe were more prevalent at depth (data not shown). The contrasting effects of the original \ntreatments and soil depth on the occurrence of Tylospora and L. rufus morphotypes meant \ntheir distribution across the site was inversely related (P <0.001; r = -0.85).  Cortinarius and \nInocybe morphotypes were again sparsely distributed. Cortinarius was most sensitive to the \nacid treatments, being completely absent from the double acid +N plots. Inocybe preferred the \nS plots (table 6).  Removal of acidity, S and N increased the production of saprophytic \nfruitbodies after 2 years, but not significantly.  Responses to the recovery treatments were \nsmall among the ECM morphotypes and fruiting bodies of the larger sporocarp formers.     \n3.7 Effects of the original treatments and removal of N, S and acidity on soil chemistry \nSoil pH:  \nTable 7 near here \nSoil pH governs many biological activities in the soil from microbial transformations to root \ngrowth [16].  Thus, changes in soil pH may be crucial to the vitality and sustainability of the \nbelow-ground community structure and function.  Soil pH (CaCl2) in 2003, into the third \ntreatment season, showed no treatment effect, whereas in water  pH showed significant \nincreases due to removal of the double acid dose and N from the N treatment (table 7).  pH in \nwater indicated a significant acidifying effect of the acid and also N treatments on the peat \nsoil so that after 7 years,  acidity was increased more by adding N than by adding N + acid. \nSoil water:  \n 12\nFigure 5 near here \n \nSoil water Mg was unaffected by acidity in 2001 but in 2002 and 2003, was almost doubled \ncompared to that measured in the control treatment which averaged ~ 30\u00b5molc throughout, \nexcept in 2003 when it rose to~ 50\u00b5molc (figure 5). By comparison the N and S treatments \nproduced similar Mg concentrations to the control.  Highest Mg concentrations were in the \nacid treatments. During the winters, in the absence of treatment, Mg concentrations remained \nsimilar to or below the control for all treatments. When acidity was removed the Mg response \ndisappeared, Mg concentrations fell well below the original treatments, and were at least 50% \nbelow the control concentrations. The effects of S and N removal on soil water Mg \nconcentrations were minimal as neither treatments had significantly affected soil water Mg \nconcentrations.  \n Soil water Ca concentrations (figure 5) mirrored the treatment responses reported for Mg \n(figure 5) except that the effects were all more exaggerated. Ca concentrations exceeded those \nof Mg. Removal of acidity caused Ca concentrations to decline to below control \nconcentrations. Control Ca concentrations averaged ~ 40\u00b5molc all except for 2002 when they \nrose to 80 \u00b5molc.  \nSoil water K responded differently to the original treatments by comparison with Mg and Ca \n(figure 5). In 2001, except for the S treatment, all other treatments had lower K concentrations \nthan the control, which measured 11\u00b5molc. Over both winter periods concentrations likewise \ntended to be below the control values of ~8 and ~10\u00b5molc for 0102 and 0203 respectively. In \n2002, the effects of the spray treatments were pronounced with the acid and N treatments \nincreasing K concentrations and the S and double acid + N dose treatments reducing K \nconcentrations to below the ~16\u00b5molc in the control. Removing S especially and N increased \nK concentrations. In 2003 only the large impact of removing S was maintained (figure 5), \nthere was no effect of the acid removal.  \n 13\nSoil water Al responded similarly to Mg and Ca (figure 5).  In 2001 concentrations for the \nacid and N treatments were similar to the control (~ 26 \u00b5molc)(figure 5). Doubling the acidity \n+ N increased soil water Al as did removing S. Acid removal from the double acid + N  \ntreatment did lower the Al concentration but in the absence of treatment, winter, this effect \ndisappeared. As seen with Mg and Ca during the 2002 spray season, all the treatments showed \nelevated concentrations, ~80% higher for the control (~ 44\u00b5molc). In 2002 the single acid + N \ntreatment increased Al which was reversed in the minus acid recovery treatment. Al \nconcentrations were significantly lowered. N and S removal increased Al, but not \nsignificantly. After this summer peak in 2002, all Al concentrations fell back to control values \nor less during the winter no spray period and were barely increased during the restricted 2003 \ntreatment season. \n The base cation (BC) to Al ratio where BC=Mg+Ca+K, was highest in the N treatment and \nreduced by the removal of N, in line with the control (figure 5). The ratios were lowest in \n2001\/2 but were 3 fold higher in 2003. The S and double acid + N treatments had the lowest \nBC\/Al ratios, which were not affected by the removal of S or acidity.  \nSodium concentrations remained relatively constant in the control (~140, 180, 270,150, 110 \n\u00b5molc) except during the 2002 spray season when concentrations almost doubled (figure 5).  \nThe S treatment (Na2SO4) more than doubled soil water Na compared with the control and \neven in the absence of spray, Na concentrations remained elevated. Omitting Na2SO4 caused \nNa concentrations to fall. Sodium concentrations were fairly unresponsive to the N and N + \nacid treatments although, N removal tended to increase Na concentrations. \nFigure 6 near here \n \nSoil water pH control values measured 4, 4.1, 3.7, 4.2, 4.3 over the five periods, being \nsignificantly more acid in 2002, when all the cation concentrations were elevated (figure 6). \nSoil water pH was more acid than the control in all the spray treatments except the one \n 14\nreceiving only N.  The S treatment did not significantly affect on soil water pH, during any \nperiod (figure 6).  Adding N made soil water more acid but where N was removed the soil \nwater pH was lower still. The acid + N treatments had the most acid soil water and there were \nnone significant increases in soil water pH when acidity was removed.  \nSoil water NH4 + concentrations over the three years were relatively stable in the control \n(~6.0, 5.5, 7.5, 10, 8 \u00b5molc) Adding or removing S did not affect soil water NH4+. There was \na large response to adding the double acid + N treatment (+5 fold soil water NH4 +) whereas, \nthe single acid + N treatment had no effect and N alone only doubled soil water NH4 +.  Over \nthe winter no spray periods, NH4+ concentrations were all more similar to control \nconcentrations, except where acidity was removed from the double acidity + N treatment, \nwhen concentrations remained high (figure 6). The addition of acid + N led to higher NH4+ \n(significantly in 2003) than when N alone was added (figure 6). \n Soil water NO3- concentrations exceeded NH4+ concentrations in the N addition treatments \n(N, NSAcid and 2NSAcid) but were barely measurable in the control and S treatments (<1 \n\u00b5molc figure 6). Adding N alone increased NO3- concentrations more than N + acidity. When \nN was removed the NO3- concentrations fell back to control values. Generally removal of \nacidity increased NO3- concentrations (figure 6).   \nSoil water SO42- concentrations varied seasonally in the control plots (~ 90, 60, 140, 60, 50 \n\u00b5molc).  There appeared to be treatment effects even where S was not added (figure 6).  \nTreatments containing S significantly enhanced SO42- concentrations during the spray period \nand there was also a small memory effect (figure 6).  N additions reduced the amount of SO42- \nrelative to the dose (figure 6). Removal of S caused SO42- concentrations to fall back to \nconcentrations measured in control plots. \n Soil water PO43- concentrations behaved in a different way from all other ions and the \nconcentrations were very low e.g. controls over the five measurement periods were 0.4, 0.3, \n1.2, 3.3 and 1\u00b5molc respectively. Treatment effects varied with the measurement period, but \n 15\nsome generalisations were apparent.  Phosphate concentrations were very low in the double \nacid treatment and there was negligible recovery (figure 6). Effects of single acid + N were \nmuch less pronounced. In 2002 plots treated with N or which had received N, had increased \nphosphate concentrations (figure 6). Adding S barely affected soluble PO43- concentrations.  \n3.8 Relationships between ions in soil water:  \nFigure 7 near here \n \nA range of relationships between ions were explored, and the best relationships were between \nSO42- and Al3+ (Figure 7) for double acid + N R2= 0.9609, acid + N R2 = 0.9738 and for the \nrecovery treatments minus acid R2 = 0.9767 and minus N R2 = 0.9209. Ca2+ concentrations \nwere also linearly related to SO42- concentrations in the acid treatments R2= 0.9718 (double) \nand 0.93 (single). \n \n3.9 Exchangeable cations  \nFigure 8  near here \n \nThese were only assessed once in the spring following the eighth and final year of treatment.  \nCation concentrations were highly variable between plots and between the ridges, where the \ntrees were planted, and the undisturbed area between the two rows of trees. No significant \ntreatment effects were found, either between the original or recovery treatments for either area \nand so the data were averaged for the ridge and middle areas. Data for the main cations, likely \nto affect the trees are shown in figure 8, as proportions of the CEC, ~185 cmolc kg-1. The \nexchange complex was dominated, > 50% by Al3+, which was increased in all the treatments. \nCa2+ occupied 8-19%, < 10% by Mg2+ and <5% for the monovalent cations K+ and Na+. \n4 Discussion \n 16\nThis recovery experiment was established to investigate how quickly different parts of a forest \necosystem (Sitka spruce), which had been treated with elevated N, S and acid + N deposition, \ncould recover when these pollutants were removed.  Some responses were quite rapid, \nparameters that had responded quickly to the original treatments, e.g. elevation of cation \nconcentrations in the soil water appeared to be reversed equally quickly, with no enhancement \nonce acidity was removed. By comparison most effects of the double acid + N treatment, \nwhich involved supplying pH 2.5 H2SO4 + NH4NO3, at twice the frequency and thus N and S \ndoses as the acid + N treatment, produced significant effects that were often not, or less \neffectively, reversed. \n4.1 Growth, N responses and factors influencing growth \nTree growth appears to be something of an enigma on this site, yield class 27 is good, yet the \nneedle nutrient concentrations, for N, P and Ca all lie very close to the minimum values \nreported by Innes [10] for 30-40 year old Sitka spruce surveyed in the UK. Concentrations of \nsoil solution Mg which was very sensitive to the treatments, was relatively abundant in the \nneedles, possibly reflecting the maritime influence at this site [17,18].  Foliar N \nconcentrations, although low were still 10-20% above the minimum reported values, possibly \nexplaining the absence of a large growth response to N.  However K concentrations, not \nunexpectedly as peat is notoriously K deficient [19], were less than half of the minimum \nreported by Innes [10].  By comparison with minimum nutrient concentrations for Norway \nspruce [10], our nutrient values still fell at the low end of values expected to restrict growth \nand cause deficiency symptoms, neither of which were apparent.   \nThelin [20] used the ratio of N to other nutrients as an indicator of nutrient status, the \nhigher the value the more deficient the nutrient relative to N. Our ratios for Sitka spruce, \nexpressed as a percentage relative to N, at ~29, 10, 10, 19 for K, P, Mg and Ca respectively \nfor current year needles fall at the very lowest end for K, quoted for Norway spruce [20].  \nDoubling acidity reduced the K ratio to 20, and yet growth was not obviously reduced. This \n 17\ntreatment also shed most needles and may have redistributed nutrient through internal \nrecycling to meet demand, but this theory is not supported by other nutrient data.  \n  The sprayed control trees performed poorly compared with the other treatments, \nparticularly the no spray control, which also received no additional nutrients.  Significant \nleaching of K with just water was measured in throughfall from all treatments [17,18].  We \nwere unable to detect these losses in measurements of the foliar nutrient concentrations, \nsuggesting that reporting nutrients as percent dry weight may not be representative of \nphysiologically active nutrient pools. Sitka spruce, before canopy closure, appears to be more \ntolerant than Norway spruce of unfavourable nutrient concentrations \/ nutrient ratios, so long \nas N is not deficient. This experiment has highlighted the increased risk of K deficiency, from \nenhanced leaching, for Sitka spruce growing on organic soils under a wetter climate. \n 18\n4.2 Effects of acid removal on base cations \nAfter 8 years of treatment with acid + N the concentrations of soil water Mg and Ca were still \nelevated, while K concentrations were low. After removal of the acid these ion concentrations \nbarely exceeded the control, but because Al concentrations also fell, the BC:Al ratio remained \nrelatively stable. Values fall within the range that Sverdrup and Warfvinge [21] consider \nunlikely to negatively affect the growth of Norway spruce, which would appear to be more \nconservative than Sitka spruce with respect to its soil chemical tolerance. Hru\u0161ka et al. [22] \nfound a negative relationship between the BC\/Al ratio in the organic rooting zone and \ndefoliation however their values were < 2; our values ranged between 2 and 5. Foliar base \ncation concentrations reflected these falling soil solution base cation concentrations, but on \nthis site remained sufficient. We cannot comment on how long the base cation status could be \nsustained, but with the maritime source of Mg, which the trees were able to take up [17], \ntogether with the potentially reducing demand of a closed canopy, it seems likely that on this \nsite the reducing base cation concentrations as a response to falling acidity would not \ncompromise tree growth. \n 19\n  Declining K availability as acidity inputs fall could reduce growth.  Nitrification \nresponded positively to falling acidity and this could increase K leaching, via the mobile \nanion effect. However, sulphate concentrations also fell back to below control values in the \nrecovery treatments and could counteract the nitrification effect. Both Ca2+ and Al3+ \nconcentrations were positively related to SO42- concentrations, as observed by Sogn and \nAbrahamsen [23] in a lysimeter experiment with H2SO4 and NH4NO3. The benefit of falling \nAl concentrations would be offset by the concomitant fall in Ca2+ concentrations.  In this soil \nthere was no \u2018memory effect\u2019 and desorption of SO42- over and above control concentrations, \nas implied by Matzner and Murach [24] suggested that when soil solution SO42-concentrations \nfall to very low levels the legacy of previous S deposition may desorb, offsetting the benefits \nof lower S deposition. One possible explanation for minimal desorption maybe that the large \nC and organic ligand resource present restricted the amount of SO42- retained [24] by this soil \nover the eight years of inputs. \n4.3 Effects of acid removal on N uptake and availability \nThe presence of acidity has had contrasting effects on N uptake by the trees. At the canopy \nlevel, NO3- uptake was stimulated by the presence of acidity, H+ ions, via co-transport to \nmaintain electroneutrality, whereas the uptake of NH4+ ions fell in the presence of acidity, out \ncompeted by H+ for uptake sites [17,18]. Supplying N with acidity negated its stimulatory \neffect on fine roots, so restricting the potential of the trees to take up the additional N via the \nroots [5].  Fine root growth responded positively to the significant increase in soil pH (H2O) \nassessed after 2 years, when acidity was removed.  These changes led to a noticeable increase \nin foliar N status. These results strongly suggest that as the proportion of acid to N deposition \ndeclines, N uptake will increase in response to the improvement in fine root growth.  \nMycorrhizas were less affected by acidity per se and we have already seen that N additions \nalone can reduce their diversity [25]. Whether the increased potential for N uptake by spruce \nrepresents an improvement in the status quo will depend on the N status of the ecosystem. \n 20\nThe removal of acidity also influenced the availability of N in the soil.  On this acid \npeat, the removal of acidity from the double acid treatment led to higher soil solution NO3- \nconcentrations. Ammonium concentrations appeared to go in the opposite direction, implying \nincreased nitrification in response to lower acidity [26]. Adding N with acid enhanced soil \nwater NO3- concentrations by less than half as much as N and even when the acid was \nremoved soil water NO3- concentrations remained below those in the N only treatment, again \nimplying that the acidity had reduced nitrification. Removing acidity had variable, seasonally \ndependent effects, probably linked to the microbial nitrifying community, (nitrification was \nnot assessed). Killham [27] suggests between year variation in the scale of change in soluble \nN reflects the balance between soil moisture and temperature effects on nitrification.  \nNitrification is also sensitive to allelopathy, so the effect of removing acidity may not just be \ndirect, but may also involve effects on other microorganisms which may include soil fauna, \nfungi and heterotrophic bacteria [27].  Equally NH4+ may not be the only N source, nitrifying \nfungi can use organic N which is much more abundant (> 10 fold) than the inorganic ions, \neven where the treatment includes mineral N. The acidity effects on N availability in this acid \npeat soil appear to be mediated through nitrification and a high degree of pH sensitivity \namongst the soil microbial community. \n4.4 Fate of applied N \n 21\nIncreases in foliar N status and stemwood growth, relative to the control trees, were relatively \nmodest on this site, suggesting the extra N (400 and 800 kg N ha-1) was not stored above \nground.  Large pools of N were measured in the fine roots and litter, almost 50% higher than \nN concentrations in the foliage, but neither the N nor acidity had significantly enhanced root \nN concentrations. Ectomycorrhizal fungi can sequester N in osmiophilic vacuolar bodies in \nthe fungal mantles that enclose mycorrhizal roots, which tend to be more common following \nN additions [28]. No difference in % N was found, but there were large differences in root \nmass in response to N, probably diluting the N concentration. Acidity restricted fine root \ngrowth and N uptake but root mass was substantially increased by N without acidity. N \nadditions also increased litter, especially when added with acid. On this site 25% of the \nadditional N, was sequestered in the litter layer. There was no effect of the single acid dose on \nthe amount of N sequestered.  The double acid + N treatment sequestered about the same \nproportion of its mineral N input explaining the higher soil solution N concentrations. \nThese observations suggest that acidity increases the amount of N that will leach and \nbe lost from the system. The C:N ratio  which ranges from 30 to 37 still exceeds the critical \nratio below which NO3- leakage is predicted [29]. However, our results suggest that when N is \ndeposited with acidity the system will be more likely to leak N at a higher C:N ratio.   \n4.5 N effects below ground \n 22\nThe significance of increasing N concentrations, and acidity, with respect to effects on fine \nroots and mycorrhizas has been widely debated [30].  In this very acid soil fine root mass was \nhighly sensitive to the effects of acidity and N inputs. Removing acidity significantly \nincreased fine root mass whereas removing N reduced the mass of fine roots. There were no \nsignificant changes in mycorrhizas in response to N or acid removal. Nitrogen additions \nsignificantly increased the proportion of non-mycorrhizal tips. None of the treatments affected \nlive root percentages. Our results appear to contradict those discussed by Matzner and Murach \n[30] who report negative effects of increasing N inputs on fine roots. Our results indicate \nSitka spruce roots respond positively to N but negatively to acid, but that N does compromise \nmycorrhizas.  For a more detailed discussion of the effects of N deposition on mycorrhizas see \nSheppard and Wallander [31].  \n5 Conclusions \nA decline in acidity will affect the bioavailability of N through several mechanisms: improved \nfine root growth ie. increased uptake surface and improved conditions for nitrification. Base \ncation concentrations will also be reduced but the impact on tree growth will be site and \nspecies dependent.  Effects on N and base cations were quite rapid. Where acid inputs have \nbeen high, recovery may be slow and significant amounts of N deposition may be lost through \nleaching. As observed previously the soil solution is very responsive to N and acid inputs, \nunlike tree growth. Foliar nutrient concentrations appear to be more responsive to the  \nremoval of acidity and N than their addition. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was funded by Defra through the Terrestrial Umbrella, EPG 1\/3\/94 and CEH. \nFrank Harvey is thanked for undertaking the treatment application for 8 years and helping \nwith the shoot sampling.
