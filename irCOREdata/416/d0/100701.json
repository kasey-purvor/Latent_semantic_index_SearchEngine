We express magnetization as emu\/cc using the SIMS\nprofile calibration of Gd incorporation distance. The 900 \u00b0C\nanneal is optimal in terms of total magnetization. The lower\nanneal temperatures may produce a lower magnetization\nthrough incomplete annealing of the implant damage. Previ-\nous reports have shown the importance of crystalline quality\nin achieving strong magnetization in transition metal-doped\nnitrides.29 Higher anneal temperatures may lead to loss of Gd\nfrom solution. An interesting feature is the change in the\n\u201cblocking temperature\u201d \u0001TB\u0002 or where ZFC\/FC curves meet.\nIf we interpret the TB as arising from superparamagnetic pre-\ncipitates, we would expect the TB to increase with annealing\ntemperature as precipitates increase in size. However, we\nobserve the opposite behavior, from the lowest to the highest\nannealing temperatures considered, which may possibly sug-\ngest a more favorable formation of non-magnetic Gd-rich\nalloys at higher annealing temperatures as well as loss of Gd\nfrom solution.

Magnetization measurements were also performed\non the unimplanted GaN samples to eliminate the possibility\nthat spurious transition metal impurities might be responsible\nfor the magnetic response.

Bulk Gd is a ferromagnetic material\nwith Curie temperature of 308 K, while rocksalt-phase GdN\nis also ferromagnetic with TC of 72 K.The observed mag-\nnetic properties may come from Gd precipitates which are\nlikely to have a different Curie temperature than bulk Gd or\nfrom the Gd3Ga2, whose magnetic properties are not known.\nWe also cannot rule out a contribution from a true GaGdN\nalloy component.\nThe XRD spectrum from Gd-implanted AlN annealed at\n900 \u00b0C showed only Gd in addition to the AlN peaks.
