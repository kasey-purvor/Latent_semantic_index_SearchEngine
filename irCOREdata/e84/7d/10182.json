I explore the means by which cultural \nexpectations are communicated from parent to baby, by the positive and \nnegative projective identifications which can help or hinder development.  \n \nIt is generally accepted today by professionals involved in the study of infants \nfrom a variety of theoretical perspectives that the healthy emotional and \ncognitive development of a baby is dependent upon a nurturing environment \nat both physical and psychological levels.  Recent research in the fields of \nneuroscience, of developmental psychology and of psychoanalytically \ninformed infant observation studies all point in this direction. \n \nSue Gerhardt (2004), a psychoanalytic psychotherapist and co-founder of the \nOxford Parent-Infant Project brings together findings from the fields of \nneuroscience, psychology and psychoanalysis.  She explains why parental \nlove is essential for healthy brain development in infancy, and how \ninteractions between babies and their parents have a major impact in this \nrespect.  Gerhardt writes:  \u201cthe poorly handled baby develops a more reactive \nstress response and different biochemical patterns from a well-handled baby\u201d. \nThe psychic growth of a thriving infant can only be convincingly understood in \n 1\nthe context of a dependent, reciprocal relationship between a baby and his \nprimary care-providers, usually, but by no means invariably the parents.  \n \nHowever, in order to attempt to understand the complexity of factors at play in \nthe developmental processes, the differences in temperament between \nindividual babies must also be taken into consideration.  Studies like that of Di \nCagno  (1984) show that the combination of a lively baby with a depressed \nmother is more likely to promote healthy psychological development in the \ninfant than the combination of placid baby and depressed mother. Obviously, \nthe personality of the mother similarly has an effect on infant development \nand later I will discuss Likierman\u2019s (1998) conceptualisation of the impact of \npositive maternal projective identifications on the mother-baby relationship.  \n \nI would now like to focus upon the significance of cultural factors in \npsychological development  that I think provide a broader framework to our \nunderstanding. Firstly I want to consider infants brought up in a middle-class \nwestern cultural context and draw attention to current socio-cultural trends \nthat tend to undervalue what we know about the importance of dependency \nand reciprocity as essential ingredients for healthy infant development. \n \nPamela Sorensen (2005) of the Under Fives Study Center, Virginia, USA \nwrites about basic cultural assumptions that may underlie parental views of \nwhat is important for positive emotional and cognitive development of children \nin the USA, and I think her ideas are also applicable to some countries in \nWestern Europe.  I will use material taken from infant observations presented \n 2\nin seminars that I have led in both Italy and the UK, which have been carried \nout using a psychoanalytic framework of thinking. \n \nIn her description of North American society, Sorensen (2005) writes:  \n\u201cAmericans value autonomy, independence and self reliance \u2026 The imagery \nassociated with this mentality persists and permeates American culture\u201d. \nSorensen describes the way in which there has been a surge in the marketing \nof toys and videos which teach without the need for human contact, adding \nthat \u201cthe idea of the autonomous learner is idealised in American culture\u201d.  I \nthink that there has been a similar promotion of such toys in western Europe, \naccompanied by an increase in TV programmes aimed at a very young \naudience, with a distinctly \u2018educational\u2019 emphasis.  This cultural trend, in that it \nencourages independence (or one could argue, pseudo-independence) from \na very early age runs in direct opposition to the notion, borne out by scientific \nresearch and observation, that dependency on a reliable, protective, receptive \ncare-giver is the salient requirement for sound development. \n \nFrom a psychoanalytically informed infant observation perspective, Bick\u2019s \n(1968) concept of \u201csecond skin\u201d formation has proved to be a very useful way \nof thinking about pseudo-independence.  Bick describes ways in which babies \ncan attempt to hold themselves together by developing rigid defences in \nsituations of inadequate containment, where dependency needs are unmet. \n \nWilfred Bion\u2019s (1962) concept of the \u2018container and the contained\u2019 provides us \nwith a psychoanalytic model of the mind in which reciprocity is the basis of all \n 3\nlearning, both emotional and cognitive.  In this model, the infant\u2019s states of \nmind, his desires and frustrations, are communicated to a receptive and \nunderstanding parent, initially at a primitive level then later verbally.  The \ncontaining parent receives and processes these raw communications in her \nmind, and conveys them back to the baby, now imbued with meaning and in a \ntolerable form. \n \nI hope to illustrate, using infant observation material, different modes of \nreciprocity in play situations, in which the parent is either predominantly \nreceptive and containing in relation to the baby, or by contrast seems to be \npushing the baby towards premature independence, tending to deny \ndependency needs.  All the extracts are from observations carried out by \nstudents in the UK and in Italy, who are studying infant development by \nmeans of careful observation of babies in their own  homes on a weekly basis \nover a two-year period. \n \nThe first example is of baby Harriet and her mother Susan, using two extracts \nof observations, the first from when Harriet was five months old, then at age \nnine months.  In this observation Harriet, at five months, had just awoken from \na sleep. The observer wrote: \n\u201cHarriet grabbed a rattle and shook it then dropped it and reached for a soft \nfabric ring that she also shook.  The ring didn\u2019t make a noise and she dropped \nit and tried another, larger ring, which did make a noise.  As she did this, she \nlooked up at me and smiled, and I felt she was enjoying her newfound skills.  \nSusan rejoined us and told me that the rings were part of a new stacking toy.  \n 4\nApparently Harriet had not liked the toy at first, although Susan wondered if \nshe had been tired, as she had been introduced to it just before her sleep.  \nSusan sat down next to Harriet and by this time Harriet was smiling, laughing \nand talking, and looking from one of us to the other \u2026 Harriet reached out \ntowards the base of the toy, and Susan passed it to her.  Susan then picked \nup all the stacking pieces putting them near Harriet.  Some of the rings made \na crunching noise when squeezed, others a rattling noise when shaken.\u201d \n \nIn this observation, Susan lets the observer know that Harriet had not initially \nliked this \u2018educational\u2019 toy (stacking rings in order of size) yet she can enjoy \nplaying with it in her own way, when mother left the room.   \nHere is Harriet again, four months later, aged nine months.  The observer \nwrote: \n\u201cSusan picked Harriet up out of her chair and took her over to the enclosure.  \nShe sat her down on the sheepskin next to the toy box.  Harriet reached into \nthe box and pulled out a beany toy, a dog.  Susan found the rabbit that she \nhad bought for Harriet.  Harriet held up the dog next to the rabbit before taking \nthe rabbit from her mother.  It felt as though she was comparing them.  She \noffered the dog to Susan and then to me, but withdrew her hand almost \nimmediately; Susan said \u2018It\u2019s the thought that counts!\u2019  Harriet found an empty \ntennis ball tube.  She banged on the lid, turned it round and used her fingertip \nto explore the other plastic end.  She kept turning it round from one end to the \nother.  She banged it again and Susan gave her the little drums.  Harriet \ncopied Susan hitting the drums and then returned to the tennis ball tube.  \n 5\nEventually, she put it down and found a ball, carefully putting her fingertip \nonto the valve where the pump would connect.\u201d  \nIn this observation a more reciprocal two-way interaction between mother and \nbaby is demonstrated, involving mirroring and imitation.  Maria Rhode (2005), \nProfessor of Child Psychotherapy at the Tavistock Clinic, differentiates \nbetween developmental imitation of this kind, and mimicry which is non- \ndevelopmental. \n \nSusan allows Harriet the freedom to choose which toys she wants to play \nwith, and in which way, that is not necessarily for the purpose for which they \nwere designed.  The play is creative and experimental.  Susan follows her \ndaughter\u2019s lead, offering similar toys to those Harriet has chosen (the rabbit, \nthe drums) perhaps with an educational intention in that drums are made for \nbanging, tennis ball tubes are not, but Susan joins in with Harriet, interacting \nwith her without coercing or forcing her own agenda.  It seems to me that \nSusan is able to locate her natural wish to educate her child, that is for Harriet \nto develop emotionally and cognitively, in the reciprocal relationship between \nparent and baby in which the mother can be sensitive to her infant\u2019s need to \nexperiment and to explore, at the same time as leading her onwards by \nproviding a stimulating environment. \n \nIn 1988 Meira Likierman, a consultant child psychotherapist at the Tavistock \nClinic, wrote a paper about maternal love and positive projections.  She \nwanted to draw attention to \u201can aspect of maternal love which has not been \nemphasized in psycho-analytical theory, and which represents the mother\u2019s \n 6\nprojections of her own loving emotions rather than her ability to receive her \ninfant\u2019s projected feelings\u201d.  I would like here to differentiate between the \nvalue of positive projections as evidenced in the reciprocal relationship \nbetween Susan and Harriet, and negative maternal projections. \n  \n Likierman (1988) points out that a mother has a need to express her own \nloving emotions and to have these valued and confirmed by her baby.  She \nadds that the mother\u2019s self-expressive needs in fact contribute to infant \ndevelopment, and that this is part of a mother\u2019s function in a reciprocal \nrelationship, alongside her capacities to receive, contain and feed back in a \nmore manageable form, her infant\u2019s communications.  Returning to the infant \nobservation extract above, Susan needs to participate in her baby\u2019s play as a \nmeans of expressing her love and her desire for her baby to develop healthily.  \nThis is entirely different from a mother\u2019s need forcefully to intrude into, direct \nand control her baby\u2019s play, which it can be argued is based on a negative \nmaternal projection. \n  \nOf positive projections, Likierman (1988) writes:  \u201cthe mother\u2019s primitive \u2026 \nlove for her infant has the important function of transmitting to it positive \nfeelings which are not his own, and which he has not demanded by crying.  \nThey do \u2018intrude\u2019 into him, but offer a pleasure that is not of his own making, \nan unexpected gift, as it were.  It gives the infant an experience of receiving, \nas opposed to the experience of earning and demanding pleasure\u201d. \n \n 7\nIn the infant observation material that follows, I think it is possible to see a \ncomplex mixture of positive and negative projections from the mother, \nClaudia, towards her baby, Laura. \n \nThe observer described this mother as warm and friendly, yet also very \nneedy.  The mother talked to the observer about her own feelings to the \nextent that the task of observation sometimes became very difficult, the \nobserver\u2019s attention being torn between mother and baby.  Claudia was \nclearly delighted by her daughter Laura; her intelligence, her impressive \ncapacity to learn and to achieve her milestones early.  To the observer \nClaudia confided that she herself had been a \u2018a boring baby\u2019, apparently her \nown mother\u2019s words, and Claudia was determined that Laura would be quite \nthe opposite. \n \nThe following observation took place when Laura was one and a quarter \nyears old. The observer wrote: \n\u201cLaura picked up a toy which was a box with four geometric holes and four \ngeometric squares.  With great concentration she picked up a square and \ntried to put it in a wrong hole, while Claudia was looking at her to see if Laura \ncould do that.  She helped Laura to put it in a correct hole and said \u2018She \nknows how to put the circle in a correct hole.\u2019  Claudia then gave Laura a \ncircle and she placed it correctly.\u201d   \n \nIn discussing this observation the seminar group thought that mother\u2019s \nneediness is reflected in her wish for Laura to perform, to show her \n 8\nintelligence and to be successful.  This could be understood in terms of \nmother\u2019s internal view of herself as the boring baby of a critical mother.  A \nnegative maternal projection would arise if mother felt that Laura were a \nboring baby.  This would be intolerable to Claudia, who has constantly to \nprove to herself and to the observer that this is not so.   \n \nThe next extract from the observation of Laura is from when she was one and \na half years old.  The observer wrote: \nMother said, \u2018Laura, let\u2019s go to show J your new pair of shoes\u2019.  Laura quickly \nleft Claudia\u2019s room, went to her own room and opened the bottom drawer of \nher chest of drawers and picked up a pair of smart red leather shoes.  Claudia \nproudly said, \u2018Well done Laura\u2019.  Laura tried to put on one shoe.  Claudia said \n\u2018No Laura, they are too big for you.  Don\u2019t use them yet, you need to wait \nlonger\u2019.\u201d \n \nMother\u2019s need for Laura to be unrealistically clever is also evident; she \nexpects her to understand that the new shoes are too big and that she should \nnot wear them yet, rather than being able to respond to Laura\u2019s pleasure in \nthe new shoes. \n \n Here is a final extract from the observation of Laura when she was nearly one \nand three quarter years old: \n\u201cClaudia stood up, turned off the TV and said that she would put on music \nfrom a CD.  When she turned off the TV Laura started to whimper and Claudia \ntold her that she would have nice music because the Tweenies was boring.  \n 9\nLaura whimpered and stared at her mother.  Claudia picked up a big plastic \nbag that contained building blocks and said \u2018Let\u2019s go to play with this Laura\u2019.  \nClaudia put them on the floor and started to build something with the blocks.  \nLaura looked at her mother\u2019s building, trying to do the same.  She put her \nblocks onto Claudia\u2019s and her mother said, \u2018We are building a very high \nconstruction\u2019.  As the building grew Laura stood up and was still adding blocks \nwhen the construction fell on the floor and Laura laughed.  She started \nanother one, pushed it over and then repeated the operation.  Claudia said, \n\u2018Laura, let\u2019s try to separate the blocks by colours\u2019.  Laura stared at her mother \nwho was teaching her the colours of the blocks.  While she was doing this \nLaura was putting the blocks in the bag and trying to separate them in the \nsame way as her mother, but unsuccessfully.\u201d \n \nIn this observation an immediate link comes to mind; the Tweenies is Laura\u2019s \nfavourite TV programme yet Claudia switches it off and says it is boring.  \nClaudia\u2019s anxiety that Laura will be a boring baby, just as her own mother \nreportedly described Claudia\u2019s infancy, drives her to try to make sure that \nLaura plays educational games that will develop her intellect.  Claudia also of \ncourse loves her daughter and allows her space to knock the building block \ntower over and enjoy doing so, but Claudia cannot resist directing and \norganising her play. \n \nAt the end of this extract Laura is trying to imitate her mother. This raises the \nquestion as to whether this is a \u201cdevelopmental imitation\u201d (Rhode, 2005) or a \nkind of conformity brought about through a feeling of being under pressure. \n 10\nSimilarly one could think about whether the mother feels under pressure in \nrelationship to the observer, a pressure to perform as a \u201cgood mother\u201d, \nanxious to please, not boring. \n \nIt will be apparent that in neither of the mother-baby reciprocal relationships \ndescribed above does there exist a pure culture of either positive or negative \nprojections but rather two different mixtures of both.  I suggest that it is only \nproblematic for development if negative projections predominate, and \nespecially if prevailing cultural norms foster the tendency in parents to control \nand pressurize their babies. \n \nA brief comparison of Western and Eastern cultures with regard to parent-\ninfant relationships adds another perspective on different attitudes and \npractices.  Harvey B. Aronson (2004), writing on the subject of the differences \nbetween Asian and western culture cites research carried out by the cultural \npsychologists Markus and Kitayama who identify a strong emphasis on \nconnection, relatedness and interdependence in family patterns in Asian \ncountries.  By contrast they found that in North America and in many \nEuropean countries high value is placed on individuation, a process whereby \npeople strive to achieve autonomy, independence and self-reliance.  Aronson \nquotes an example of this distinction noted by Kim Insoo Berg, family \ntherapist: in Korea, with its emphasis on social connectedness, children are \npunished by being put outside of the house \u2013 an enforced separation from the \nfamily, whereas in the West, where the emphasis is on independence, the \n 11\nfavourite punishment of children in our times is to be \u2018grounded\u2019, that is, to be \nkept inside the home with the family! \n \nIn Asian countries, except in large modern cities where Western values \nincreasingly tend to predominate, the involvement of the extended family in \nchild rearing is in stark contrast to the nuclear family of the West.  In an infant \nobservation carried out in London, a student presented to the seminar group \nher observations of a family in which a white English woman had married an \nIndian man, who felt strongly that their children should be raised in a manner \nthat incorporated traditional Indian family values.  His parents arrived from \nIndia shortly before the birth of their first child, a son, and stayed with the new \nparents for six months in their tiny apartment.  The grandmother played a \ndominant role in nurturing the baby and the seminar group empathised with \nthe mother, who seemed to be doing her best to manage the situation, yet \nclearly found it difficult.  She would retreat to another room to breast-feed her \nson as if making a bid for privacy and this was the only time she had alone \nwith him.  The weekly observations were filled with accounts of grandmother \ncuddling and playing with the baby, whilst mother cooked traditional Indian \nmeals for the family, and returned part-time to work in order to pay the rent \n(her husband was a student). \n \nWhen the grandparents returned to India the seminar group breathed a sigh \nof relief, thinking that at last the mother would be able to get to know her \nbaby.  This indeed was the case and the baby seemed to have made a close \nbond with his mother in his early life, despite spending so much time with his \n 12\ngrandmother.  Then father announced that he would be taking the little boy to \nIndia for six weeks, so that he could be with his grandparents and extended \nfamily for his first birthday.  Mother would have to stay behind to earn money.  \nAgain the seminar group felt very concerned about the impact of this \nseparation on mother and baby as if both mother\u2019s and baby\u2019s emotional \nneeds were being given little consideration at the the expense of the \npredominant cultural values of the father.   \n \nDuring the six week absence the observer visited the mother who missed her \nson and her husband very much and seemed depressed. This would not be \nusual practice in an infant observation and suggested that the observer was \nsympathetic to the mother\u2019s predicament and possibly judgemental about the \nfather.  The seminar group anticipated that the re-uniting of mother and baby \nafter the trip might give rise to complex, perhaps conflicting feelings.  We \nwondered if the little boy would be confused in light of the attachments he had \nmade to his mother and to his grandmother, and whether the loss of each of \nthem in turn would leave him unsure about who was his main caregiver.  It \nwas a salutary experience for the seminar group to find that on his return to \nLondon this little boy had no difficulty in re-establishing a close, loving \nrelationship with his mother, but had reportedly also loved being with his \nextended family in India.  Doubtlessly he had missed both his mother and his \ngrandmother when separated from them, but this did not have a detrimental \neffect on his capacity to sustain a secure attachment. It led the seminar group \nto question whether we had made culture-bound assumptions about what is \noptimal for infant development. \n 13\n M. Leng (2005) gives a moving account of filming an infant observation in a \nHindu family in rural Nepal.  This formed part of a research project led by \nLynn Barnett based on cross-cultural observation videos and studying \nemotional development.  Leng writes:  \u201cindividual identity remains a Western \nconcept and family identities in Nepalese culture differ from those in the \nWest\u201d.  She describes the way in which the baby, a girl, was usually held by \nmembers of the extended family and she writes:  \u201cHindu child rearing is reliant \non the support of the extended family and other family members are readily \non hand to hold the baby.  She grew to be a very sociable baby and her \nstimulation came from being touched, held and included.\u201d Leng reflects on the \nmother\u2019s role in this traditional village community:  \u201cTo the extent that \nindividual identity remains a Western concept, I had never felt her to be the \nmaternal centre around which this family gathered.\u201d \n \nThis baby was the fourth girl in a family with as yet no boys, so her birth would \nbe seen as inauspicious in a society where sons are valued more than \ndaughters.  This may have been a factor in the mother\u2019s observed depression \nfollowing the birth.  Here it seemed that a baby could benefit from the warmth \nand liveliness of the extended family that may also be a support for a \ndepressed mother. \n \nAs a final example of cultural differences in the child-parent relationship I will \nturn to a biographical source.  In his autobiography \u201cFreedom in Exile\u201d the \nfourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet describes a painful and unhappy period of his \n 14\nlife when aged three years he had to leave his parents and his family home, in \naccord with cultural expectations, to begin life in a monastery.  He writes:  \u201cIt \nis very hard for a small child to be separated from his parents,\u201d but later he \nadds \u201cWhen I was very young, I developed a close attachment to the Master \nof the Kitchen.  So strong was it that he had to be in my sight at all times, \neven if it was only the bottom of his robe visible through a doorway or under \nthe curtains which served as doors inside Tibetan houses.  Luckily, he \ntolerated my behaviour.  He was a very kind and simple man, and almost \ncompletely bald.  He was not a very good storyteller, nor an enthusiastic \nplaymate, but this did not matter one bit.  I have often wondered since about \nour relationship.  I see it now as being like the bond between a kitten or some \nsmall animal and the person who feeds it.  I sometimes think that the act of \nbringing food is one of the basic roots of all relationships.\u201d \n \nIn conclusion, attachment considered in a non-Western cultural context needs \nto include the model of the child in a large extended family and even in a \nmonastic community.  This can be interestingly contrasted with attachment \npatterns in the nuclear family and single parent family characteristic of \nWestern society.  Returning to the main theme of this paper, psychic growth \nand reciprocity, it can be argued that a flexible use of the term attachment \nneeds to be adopted in order to encompass child-rearing practices of other \ncultures.  Furthermore, in the more affluent parts of the USA and of Western \nEurope, attention needs to be given to the phenomenon of \u201cpseudo-\nindependence\u201d arising out a culturally endorsed situation in which \n 15\nindependent learning is promoted by parents at the expense of adequately \nmeeting an infant\u2019s dependency needs. \n \nAcknowledgement:  with thanks to Margaret Rustin for her helpful comments \non this paper. \n \nREFERENCES \nAronson, H.B.
