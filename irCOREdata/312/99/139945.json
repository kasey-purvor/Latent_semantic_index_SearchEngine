Introduction\nSurface strain measurement is important in the\ncharacterization of the reliability, strength, and life-\ntime of components in many branches of engineering.\nExamples include the characterization of gas turbine\nblades, automobile parts, and composite materials.\nSurface strain is often measured using electrical\nstrain gauges, which are adhered to the surface of\nthe component of interest. A limitation with strain\ngauges is that the measurement is only made at the\nlocation at which it is attached to the surface with a\nspatial resolution determined by the dimensions of\nthe gauge. Also, the surface of the component to\nwhich the strain gauge is to be bonded may require\nsignificant preparation before the gauge will adhere\nto it sufficiently to ensure high fidelity of strain\ntransfer from the part to the gauge. Certain optical\nmeasurement techniques, such as speckle metrology,\ncan provide a solution to these problems due to their\nnoncontact nature and their ability to provide a\nmeasurement across an extended field of view.\nSpeckle shearing interferometry [1\u20133], commonly\nknown as shearography, is an interferometric speckle\ntechnique that is sensitive to changes in the displa-\ncement gradient of surfaces under an applied load.\nThe technique is often used in the automotive and\naerospace industries for qualitative nondestructive\nanalysis, for example, in the detection of disbonds\nand defects in composite materials [4].\nA. Single-Channel Shearography\nThe optical arrangement for a single-channel shear-\nography system that is predominantly sensitive to\nan out-of-plane displacement gradient is shown in\nFig. 1. The arrangement shown here is based on a\nshearing Michelson interferometer. Coherent light\nfrom the laser is expanded to illuminate a region of\ninterest on the target\u2019s surface. Light scattered from\nthe target is imaged onto the charge-coupled device\n(CCD) camera via an image shearing device, produ-\ncing a speckle pattern on theCCDarray. The shearing\ndevice is commonly a Michelson interferometer with\n0003-6935\/11\/020134-13$15.00\/0\n\u00a9 2011 Optical Society of America\n134 APPLIED OPTICS \/ Vol. 50, No. 2 \/ 10 January 2011\nan off-axis tilt of one of the mirrors relative to the\nother, as shown in Fig. 1. The tilt between themirrors\nresults in the coherent combination of identical, but\ndisplaced, (sheared) images, producing an interfero-\nmetric speckle pattern at the CCD array that is\nsensitive to relative changes in the phase of light scat-\ntered from neighboring points on the illuminated sur-\nface. When the object is deformed, a change in the\nintensity of the individual speckles is observed.When\nmaking a measurement, interferometric speckle pat-\nterns are recorded before and after deformation of the\nobject. The two images, known as the reference frame\n(before deformation) and the signal frame (after defor-\nmation) are correlated by digital subtraction of the in-\ntensities recorded at each pixel in the CCD array. The\nresulting image consists of dark and light bands\nwhere the two speckle patterns are in-phase and\nanti-phase, respectively, and is knownas a correlation\nfringe pattern. The fringes represent a locus of points\nwith the same magnitude of displacement gradient.\nPhase analysis techniques can be used to recover\nthephasedistributionacross the object surface,which\nis, ingeneral, a combination of the in-planeandout-of-\nplane components of the deformation gradients on the\nobject surface. This is often achieved using the tech-\nnique known as temporal phase stepping [5], which\ninvolves the recording of a series of images with a re-\nlative, and usually known, phase shift between them.\nThe images are then combined using a phase-\nstepping algorithm to yield the phase. These phase\nvalues are wrapped between \u2212\u03c0 and \u00fe\u03c0. To obtain a\ncontinuous phase measurement, the 2\u03c0 discontinu-\nities need to be removed using a process known as\nphase unwrapping [3,6].\nB. Multicomponent Shearography\nA single shearography measurement channel is sen-\nsitive to the gradient of a component of the surface\ndisplacement. The direction of this component is de-\ntermined by the sensitivity vector of the shearogra-\nphy instrument, as shown in Fig. 2. The sensitivity\nvector, k^, is defined as the bisector of the observation\nvector, o^, and illumination vector i^:\nk^ \u00bc o^ \u2212 i^: \u00f01\u00de\nThe phase distributions from a single shearography\nchannel with the shear in the x direction (horizon-\ntally) and y direction (vertically), respectively, are\ngiven by\n\u0394\u03d5x \u00bc\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\n\u0001\nkx\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u00fe ky\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n\u00fe kz\n\u2202w\n\u2202x\n\u0002\ndx; \u00f02\u00de\n\u0394\u03d5y \u00bc\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\n\u0001\nkx\n\u2202u\n\u2202y\n\u00fe ky\n\u2202v\n\u2202y\n\u00fe kz\n\u2202w\n\u2202y\n\u0002\ndy; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere u, v are the in-plane and w is the out-of-plane\ncomponents of the displacement vector, U^ \u00bc \u00f0u; v;w\u00de.\nThe relationship between the displacement vector\ncomponents and the x, y, and z directions is illu-\nstrated in Fig. 2.\nIn general, a shearography phase measurement\nwill contain contributions from all three orthogonal\ndisplacement gradient components: \u2202u\n\u2202x,\n\u2202v\n\u2202x, and\n\u2202w\n\u2202x ; or\n\u2202u\n\u2202y,\n\u2202v\n\u2202y, and\n\u2202w\n\u2202y . To retrieve these components, at least\nthree separate phase measurements are required,\neach with a different sensitivity vector. This can be\nachieved in a practical system either by using multi-\nple illumination directions and a single observation\ndirection and performing the measurements sequen-\ntially [7\u20139], or by using multiple observation direc-\ntions and a single illumination direction and\nperforming the measurements in parallel. This latter\nmethod can be more easily applied using imaging fi-\nber bundles [10,11], where each view is ported to a\nquadrant of a single CCD camera.\nFig. 1.

(Color online) Relationship between the Cartesian x, y,\nand z directions and the displacement components u, v, and w.\nThe component of displacement gradient that a shearography in-\nstrument measures is determined by the sensitivity vector, k^,\nwhich is the bisector of the observation, o^, and illumination, i^, unit\nvectors.\n10 January 2011 \/ Vol. 50, No. 2 \/ APPLIED OPTICS 135\nFor multiple channels, this can be written as the\nmatrix equations\n2\n6664\n\u0394\u03d5x1\n\u0394\u03d5x2\n\u0394\u03d5x3\n..\n.\n3\n7775 \u00bc\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\n2\n6664\nkx1 ky1 kz1\nkx2 ky2 kz2\nkx3 ky3 kz3\n..\n. ..\n. ..\n.\n3\n7775\n2\n6664\n\u2202u=\u2202x\n\u2202v=\u2202x\n\u2202w=\u2202x\n3\n7775dx; \u00f04\u00de\n2\n6664\n\u0394\u03d5y1\n\u0394\u03d5y2\n\u0394\u03d5y3\n..\n.\n3\n7775 \u00bc\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb\n2\n6664\nkx1 ky1 kz1\nkx2 ky2 kz2\nkx3 ky3 kz3\n..\n. ..\n. ..\n.\n3\n7775\n2\n6664\n\u2202u=\u2202y\n\u2202v=\u2202y\n\u2202w=\u2202y\n3\n7775dy: \u00f05\u00de\nHere, kx, ky, and kz are the x, y, and z components of\nthe sensitivity vector and the subscripts refer to the\nparticular measurement channel. The orthogonal\ndisplacement gradient components are then calcu-\nlated using a matrix transformation.\nThis paper investigates the use of additional mea-\nsurement channels in shearography and, in particu-\nlar, their influence on the transformation to the\northogonal strain components. In previous work\n[7\u201311], the number of channels used in this transfor-\nmation has been limited to three, allowing Eqs. (4)\nand (5) to be solved directly. However, the transfor-\nmation results in the amplification of errors present\nin the data due to the arrangement of the sensitivity\nvectors.\nA fourth measurement channel can be easily\nadded to a shearography system, by either the addi-\ntion of a fourth illumination direction, an additional\nviewing direction, or additional shearing interferom-\neter and camera. Groves et al. [9] described a system\nwith four measurement channels. Here the fourth\nchannel allows the surface strain to be fully charac-\nterized when one of the channels has poor correlation\nfringe quality, or is obstructed as a result of the object\nshape. In this situation, the fourth channel can be\nused to replace the channel that has poor quality\ndata in the transformation. Similarly, systems using\ncoherent imaging fiber bundles [10,11] have four\nchannels available. However, in these systems, only\nthree channels are employed in the calculation of the\northogonal strain components and the remaining\ndata is discarded. Previous work in the field of planar\nDoppler velocimetry [12,13], using a similar coordi-\nnate transformation, has shown that the use of a\nfourth channel in the calculation can significantly\nimprove the results and lead to a reduction in the er-\nrors propagated to the final calculated orthogonal ve-\nlocity components. For geometries similar to those\ntypically found in shearography systems, these re-\nductions can be as much as 25% of the error [13].\nA derivation of the equations used to calculate the\northogonal components using four ormore channels is\ngiven in the next section of this paper, followed by a\ndescriptionof a four-channel experimental shearogra-\nphy system and a computer model for an n-channel\nshearography system. A comparison between results\ncalculated using three or four channels is then\npresented using results of the computermodel and ex-\nperimental data for a series of test displacement\nfields. Finally the benefits of using more than four\nchannels are assessed using the computer model.\n2. Calculation of the Orthogonal Strain Components\nUsing Four (or More) Channels\nAs Eqs. (4) and (5) are similar, the derivation pre-\nsented here is in terms of the shear, ds, which can be\nin either the horizontal (ds \u00bc dx) or vertical direction\n(ds \u00bc dy).

Experimental System\nA. Experimental Arrangement\nThe system used in this investigation is a multicom-\nponent shearography system using time-division\nmultiplexing of the measurement channels. Figure 3\nshows a schematic and photograph of the experimen-\ntal arrangement. This consisted of four diode pumped\nsolid-state lasers (PHOTOP Suwtech Inc, Model\nDPGL-3020F, 532 nm, 20\u201330 mWoutput power)with\nmechanical shutters and beam expanding optics,\nmounted at the corners of a square using a cross-\nshaped support structure. A shearing Michelson in-\nterferometer, camera lens, and a CCD camera records\ninterferometric speckle images of the test object from\nthe center of this arrangement. The shearing Michel-\nson interferometer contains a beam splitter, a shear-\ning mirror that can be adjusted to give different\nmagnitudes and directions of applied shear, and a re-\nferencemirror that incorporates a piezoelectric trans-\nducer phase-stepping device. The camera is an area\nscan CCD camera (DALSA, Model CA-D4-0512A,\n75 Hz frame rate, 512 \u00d7 512 pixels) and is used in con-\njunction with a frame grabber card (Bitflow Inc.,\nRoadrunner, PCI frame grabber card).

Experimental Data Collection and Processing\nData are captured for each measurement channel se-\nquentially. The object is illuminated by light from a\nsingle laser and a sequence of five images is cap-\ntured, each with a relative \u03c0=2 phase step induced\nby a voltage applied to the piezoelectric phase step-\nper. The phases are then calculated using a five step\nalgorithm proposed by Hariharan et al. [15], which\ncompensates well for errors introduced by miscali-\nbration of the phase shifter:\n\u03d5 \u00bc tan\u22121\n\u0005\n2\u00f0I2 \u2212 I4\u00de\n2I3 \u2212 I5 \u2212 I1\n\u0006\n: \u00f013\u00de\nThis process is then repeated for all four measure-\nment channels and results in four phase images.\nThe phase shifts (\u0394\u03d51 to \u0394\u03d54) due to a deformation\napplied to the test object are then found by subtract-\ning the phases measured before and after this defor-\nmation. The resulting phase shifts are wrapped\nbetween \u2212\u03c0 and \u03c0 and need to be unwrapped prior\nto the calculation of the displacement gradients.\nMany different phase unwrapping algorithms exist,\na discussion of which is beyond the scope of this pa-\nper; here, the \u201ciso-phase unwrapping\u201d algorithm pro-\nposed by Herr\u00e1ez et al. [6] was used. A sine\u2013cosine\nfilter was applied before this unwrapping to reduce\nhigh-frequency noise within the wrapped phase\nmaps, as suggested by Aebischer and Waldner [16].\nAfter the unwrapping, a 3 \u00d7 3 median filter was ap-\nplied to remove single pixel discontinuities in the un-\nwrapped phase that are artifacts resulting from the\nphase unwrapping algorithm. This resulted in four\nunwrapped phase images, one for each measurement\nchannel, that are sensitive to different components of\nthe displacement gradient. Finally, the orthogonal\ndisplacement gradients are calculated using three\nor four measurement channels, using Eqs. (7) and\n(10)\u2013(12).\n4. Computer Model\nTo allow for a quantitative investigation into the in-\nfluence of additional channels on the transformation\nto orthogonal displacement gradient components, a\ncomputer model was used. The process used is de-\nscribed in the following subsections.\nA. Simulation of the Interferometric Speckle Images\nThe interferometric speckle images were generated\nusing a method similar to that used by Dolinko and\nKaufmann [17],modified to apply to a phase-stepping\nshearography system. First, a theoretical displace-\nment field U^ \u00bc \u00f0u; v;w\u00de was generated. From this\nand the defined magnitude of the shear, the theoreti-\ncal displacement gradients, \u2202u\n\u2202s,\n\u2202v\n\u2202s, and\n\u2202w\n\u2202x were calcu-\nlated. These are used later for comparison with the\nmodeled results. A speckle field, S1\u00f0x; y\u00de, correspond-\ning to theunshearedarmof the interferometer, is then\ngenerated according to\nS1\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc expfi\u00bd\u03d50\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00fe \u03d5U\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00fe \u03d5step\u0001g; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere \u03d50\u00f0x; y\u00de is a randomly generated phase repre-\nsenting the phase distribution of the scattered light\nfrom the rough surface and \u03d5step is the additional\nphase shift applied during the phase stepping of this\narm of the interferometer. The phase shift caused by\nthe displacement of the surface,\u03d5U\u00f0x; y\u00de, can be calcu-\nlated from the displacement field, U^\u00f0x; y\u00de, and the de-\nfined sensitivity vector, k^\u00f0x; y\u00de, at each pixel and is\ngiven by\n\u03d5U\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc\n2\u03c0\n\u03bb \u00f0k^\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00b7 U^\u00f0x; y\u00de\u00de: \u00f015\u00de\nA second speckle field, S2\u00f0x; y\u00de, corresponding to the\nshearing arm of the interferometer, is then generated\nin a similar way, but with the values of \u03d50\u00f0x; y\u00de shifted\naccording to the desired shear magnitude and direc-\ntion. This shifted phasedistribution,\u03d500\u00f0x; y\u00de, requires\nnoadditional phase step tobeadded, as this armof the\ninterferometer is notmodified during phase stepping:\nS2\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc expfi\u00bd\u03d500\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00fe \u03d5U\u00f0x; y\u00de\u0001g: \u00f016\u00de\nThe resulting interferometric intensity distribution\nI\u00f0x; y\u00de is then calculated by combining the two speckle\nfields after the application of a circular low-pass filter\nin the Fourier domain [17]. The radius of this filter re-\npresents the circular aperture of the camera lens and\ndetermines the resulting speckle size:\nI\u00f0x; y\u00de \u00bc jF\u22121fF\u00bdS1\u00f0x; y\u00de\u0001Hg \u00fe F\u22121fF\u00bdS2\u00f0x; y\u00de\u0001Hgj2;\n\u00f017\u00de\nwhere F and F\u22121 denote the forward and inverse two-\ndimensional Fourier transforms, respectively, and H\nis the circular low-pass filter in Fourier space. By\nvarying H, the speckle size of the simulation can be\nvaried; here, a speckle size of\u223c1pixelwasused, repre-\nsenting a typical experimental setup.\nTo simulate the effect of experimental noise, ran-\ndom noise was added to the interferometric speckle\nimages according to the properties of the camera used\nin the experimental system described in Section 3.\nThis included random contributions from the photon\nshot noise generated from a Poisson distribution, and\ncamera dark current and readout noise generated\nfrom a normal distribution. Finally, the intensity va-\nlueswere truncated and limited to 8 bit resolution (0\u2013\n255 counts) to account for the analog-to-digital con-\nversion process.\nB. Simulation of a Single Shearography Channel\nFor a single shearography channel, two sets of inter-\nferometric speckle images are generated using the\nsame initial phase distribution, \u03d50\u00f0x; y\u00de. A reference\nset in which the phase shift due to displacement is\n138 APPLIED OPTICS \/ Vol. 50, No. 2 \/ 10 January 2011\nzero and a signal set in which the phase shift due to\nthe displacement are included. This is the same as for\nan experimental system where a reference phase\nmust be measured before the surface deformation oc-\ncurs. Each set consists of five images with a relative\n\u03c0=2 phase step, \u03d5step applied to the unsheared arm of\nthe interferometer. The reference and signal phases\ncan then be calculated using the five step algorithm\n[15] given in Eq. (13).\nThe phase shift, \u0394\u03d5\u00f0x; y\u00de, is found by subtracting\nthe signal phase from the reference phase and apply-\ning a phase unwrapping algorithm to remove the 2\u03c0\ndiscontinuities and obtain a continuous phase mea-\nsurement. Before unwrapping, additional noise from\na normal distribution was added to simulate noise\nsources other than CCD camera noise, such as vibra-\ntions, phase shifter inaccuracies, and thermally in-\nduced phase variations. The level of this noise was\nchosen to given comparable values, to the results from\nthe experimental system described in Section 3; how-\never, as this investigation concerns the propagation of\nerrors, the actual level of error in each channel is un-\nimportant and will depend on the system to be\nmodeled.\nThe same processing as used in the experimental\nprocessing scheme described in Subsection 3.B was\napplied to simulated data. A sine\u2013cosine smoothing\nfilter [16] was applied before the \u201ciso-phase unwrap-\nping\u201d algorithm [6] was used to unwrap the data, and\nafterward a 3 \u00d7 3median filter was applied to remove\nsingle pixel discontinuities. The resulting phase shift\nis related to the displacement gradients as given in\nEqs. (2) and (3).\nC. Simulation of Multichannel Shearography System\nTo assess the performance of the methods, using\nthree channels and more than three channels, to cal-\nculate the orthogonal components, multiple shearo-\ngraphy channels were modeled for the same\ndisplacement field. This results in a simulated phase\nshift image for each channel of \u0394\u03d51\u00f0x; y\u00de to \u0394\u03d54\u00f0x; y\u00de,\nwhich can be used to solve Eqs. (4) and (5) and find\nthe orthogonal displacement gradients. This can\neither be done directly using any three of the chan-\nnels or using all of the channels and the least-\nsquares method proposed in Section 2.\nTypical phase shift images for four measurement\nchannels are shown in Fig. 4 and the results of this\ntransformation to the orthogonal displacement gra-\ndients are shown in Fig. 5, showing the theoretical\ndisplacement gradients, the simulated gradients cal-\nculated using three channels, and the simulated gra-\ndients calculated using four channels. The example\nresults shown are for the shear applied in the x direc-\ntion and for a Gaussian out-of-plane displacement.\n5. Test Deformations\nThree different test deformations were used to assess\nthe performance of the least-squares method using\nfour measurement channels. Similar test deforma-\ntions were used with the computer model (Section 4)\nand experimental system (Section 3) described above\nand the model settings, shown in Table 1, where cho-\nsen to approximately match those used in the experi-\nmental system and allow for a comparison between\nthe two.\nA. Zero Deformation\nThe first test case is with zero deformation applied;\nthis can be used as a simple estimate of the measure-\nment error and for a comparison between the error le-\nvel predicted by the model and those obtained\nexperimentally. For the model, a displacement field\nwith zeros for all components and all pixels was used.\nThe test object was a flat aluminum plate, approxi-\nmately 17 cm \u00d7 17 cm and painted with reflective\npaint that was clamped around all four edges. This\nwas illuminated sequentially by each laser and inter-\nferometric speckle images captured for each of the\nfour measurement channels. This provided the refer-\nence phases; a second set of images captured shortly\nFig. 4.

The experimental results show simi-\nlar trends, although with slightly less improvement\nfor some of the displacement gradients than pre-\ndicted by the model. This appears to be due to the\nvariation in illumination intensity across the field\nof view resulting from the Gaussian intensity profile\nof the illuminating lasers. This resulted in some var-\niation in the error level across the images.\nB. Out-of-Plane Deformation\nThe second test case was an out-of-plane deformation\nusing the test object described in Subsection 5.A but\ndeformed in the center using a micrometer screw to\napproximate a Gaussian deformation field. Figure 8\nshows the orthogonal displacement gradients for\nshear in the x direction calculated from experimental\nresults. These show the expected form, with the dis-\nplacement gradient predominantly in the out-of-\nplane direction; however, there is some displacement\ngradient present in the in-plane directions. From the\nresults shown in Fig. 8, it can be seen that there is a\nvisible reduction in the noise level for the orthogonal\ngradients computed using four channels compared to\nthose calculated using only three. It is not possible to\ndirectly calculate the error in the experimental re-\nsults as the true displacement is not known.However,\nthe error present can be estimated by subtracting the\nlocal mean value from pixels in the image, leaving\nonly the high-frequency noise. The local mean value\nwas calculated by convolving the gradient images\nwith 16 \u00d7 16 pixel averaging filter kernel. The stan-\ndard deviation of the error and the percentage reduc-\ntion when using four measurement channels are\nshown in Table 3.\nTable 2.

The in-plane displacement components, u and\nv, are set to zero and the position coordinates are\ndetermined using the modeled camera resolution\nand field of view, shown along with other model prop-\nerties in Table 1. The value for w0, the maximum\nout-of-plane displacement, was chosen to be 10 \u03bcm\nto approximately match the magnitude of the displa-\ncement expected in the experimental test deforma-\ntion. Figure 9 shows the displacement gradients\ncalculated using the model for a 10 \u03bcm maximum\ndisplacement in the out-of-plane direction.\nTo calculate the errors, the theoretical displace-\nment gradients, \u2202u\n\u2202s,\n\u2202v\n\u2202s, and\n\u2202w\n\u2202x , can then be calculated\nby using the magnitude of the camera shear and the\ntheoretical displacement field with both the in-plane\ncomponents, \u2202u\n\u2202s and\n\u2202v\n\u2202s, being zero. These theoretical\ngradients are then subtracted from the modeled re-\nsults, leaving only the error remaining; the mean\nstandard deviation of these errors and the percen-\ntage reduction are shown in Table 4. As before, the\nmean values of 20 runs of the model are given to re-\nmove variations due to speckle pattern variations\nand phase unwrapping errors. Although the experi-\nmental and modeled displacement fields are differ-\nent, the modeling suggests that reductions in the\nstandard deviation of the error of 25% to 30% should\nbe achievable using four measurement channels and\nsignificant reductions are also seen in the estimated\nerror for the experimental results.\nC. In-Plane Deformation\nAs the previous test deformation had very little in-\nplane components, a final testwasperformed to inves-\ntigate the benefits of a fourth measurement channel\nfor in-plane displacements.

As\nthis displacement gradient field would be complex to\nmodel, only experimental data are presented for this\ntest case.\nFigure 11 shows the calculated orthogonal displa-\ncement gradients for shear in the y direction. The end\nof the notch is located approximately half-way up on\nthe left-hand side of the images in the noisy region\nwhere there are no phase data. It can be seen that\nthere is again some reduction in the noise present\n\u2014this is especially visible in the \u2202u\n\u2202y components. As\nin the Subsection 5.B, the error could not be directly\ncalculated as the displacement field is unknown,\nalthough an estimate of the error can be obtained by\nsubtracting the local mean. The standard deviation\nof these estimated errors and the percentage reduc-\ntions when using a fourth measurement channel are\nshown in Table 5. These results again suggest that\nsignificant reductions in the error can be achieved\nby using a fourth measurement channel.\nIt should be noted that the addition of a fourthmea-\nsurement channel will cause extra errors where the\nadditional channel has a region where the phase un-\nwrapping has failed. This can be seen in Fig. 11 for\nthe results calculated using four channels, where\nthe fourth channel had a phase unwrapping issue\nin the bottom left portion of the field of view (shown\nby the rectangular overlay), resulting in this error\npropagating into all three calculated orthogonal com-\nponents. This is also an issue when using three chan-\nnels and, in previous work [9], data from a fourth\nchannel has been used to replace one of the three\nchannels used in the transformation. Although the\naddition of a fourth channel will increase the chances\nof a poorly unwrapped region occurring, this can be\novercome by applying a weighting in the transforma-\ntion, as given in Eq. (9). This could be based upon the\nresults of the phase unwrapping for each channel and\ndone on a pixel-by-pixel or regional basis with poorly\nunwrapped regions being given zero or low weighting\n\u2014effectively calculating the gradients at these points\nusing only three channels.\nFig. 10.

More than Four Measurement Channels\nThe least-squares method of calculating the orthogo-\nnal displacement gradients presented isnot limited to\nfour measurement channels. Although adding more\nthan four channels to an experimental system may\nbe complex, a system using scanning laser illumina-\ntion or object rotation and sequential data capture\ncould be envisaged. Therefore, the benefits of using\nmore than four channels were investigated using\nthe computermodel.Multiplemeasurement channels\nwere generated using multiple illumination direc-\ntions and a single observation direction. The observa-\ntion vector was set perpendicular to the surface at\nz \u00bc 0:75 mand the illumination sourceswhere evenly\ndistributed around a circle of radius r \u00bc 0:28 m in the\nx\u2013y plane, together with the observation position at\nz \u00bc 0:75 m. Figure 12 shows the geometries modeled\nforn \u00bc 3, 4, 5, and6 channel systems; for systemswith\nmore channels, the illumination sources were simi-\nlarly evenly distributed around the circle.\nThese geometries were then modeled using a zero\ndisplacement field as described in Subsection 5.A,\nand the orthogonal displacement gradients were cal-\nculated using all of the available measurement chan-\nnels. The standard deviation in the error and the\npercentage reduction in error in comparison to a three\nchannel system are shown plotted in Fig. 13. These\nplots show the results for the three orthogonal displa-\ncement gradients and configurations with n \u00bc 3 to\nn \u00bc 10 channels.\nThe first observation should be that the reduction\nin propagated error when a fourth measurement\nchannel is added is less than in the previous sections,\n\u223c14% compared to \u223c33%. This is due to the optimum\nconfiguration for three channels [9] being used here;\ni.e., with the three illumination positions evenly\nspaced around the circumference of a circle compared\nto the previous sections, where the illumination posi-\ntions were separated by 90\u00b0. This nonoptimum con-\nfiguration was chosen to facilitate the addition of a\nfourth channel to the experimental system.\nThe results show that the addition of extra mea-\nsurement channels leads to reductions in the propa-\ngated errors, albeit with diminishing returns. The\naddition of a fifth channel leads to a reduction of\n\u223c9%, while adding a sixth gives a further reduction\nof only 6.6%. All of the orthogonal displacement gra-\ndients, shown in Fig. 13 by different symbols, show\nsimilar reductions; however, the magnitude of the er-\nrors for the \u2202w\n\u2202s gradient are smaller than for the in-\nplane gradients due to the increased sensitivity of\nthe system to the out-of-plane component.\n7. Conclusions\nAmethod of calculating the orthogonal displacement\ngradients in a multicomponent shearography system\nusing more than the minimum three channels\nrequired and a least-squares approach has been pre-\nsented. The benefits of this approach were then\nstudied using an experimental multicomponent\nshearography system using multiple illumination di-\nrections and single observation direction to provide\nfour measurement channels, and a computer model\nof this system.\nIt was difficult to assess the performance of the\nexperimental system for test deformations directly,\nbecause the actual displacement field was un-\nknown. However, the results of a test where the\ndisplacement is known to be zero suggest that the\nFig. 12.

This agrees well with the predictions of the com-\nputer model for the same zero displacement.\nExample measurements of objects subjected to out-\nof-plane and in-plane surface displacement shows\nvisible reductions in the noise. Modeled results for\na Gaussian out-of-plane displacement suggest that\nthe reductions in the standard deviation of the error\nare again around 33%. Reductions in the error are\nalso observed for other test deformations where\nthe error is estimated by subtracting the local mean\nvalue of the displacement gradient to leave only\nhigh-frequency noise.\nThe primary disadvantages of using additional\nmeasurement channels is an increase in system com-\nplexity and increased errors when the phase unwrap-\nping has difficulties. A fourth measurement channel\nis actually relatively inexpensive and straightfor-\nward to implement, either using a fourth illumina-\ntion direction (as described here) or using imaging\nfiber bundles [11]. The addition of a fourth measure-\nment channel will increase the chances of having re-\ngions where the phase unwrapping fails, which\nresults in errors in the three orthogonal components,\ncompared with using only three channels. However,\nthis can bemitigated by assessing the performance of\nthe unwrapping algorithm and applying a weighting\nscheme in the calculation. By applying a zero or low\nweighting to regions of the affected measurement\nchannel, the orthogonal components would effec-\ntively be calculated using only three components\nand this could be done on either a pixel-by-pixel or\nregional basis.\nThe addition of further channels to a shearography\nsystem will lead to further reductions in the propa-\ngated errors, although with diminishing returns and,\nfor practical systems, the added cost and complexity\nassociated with this may outweigh the advantage of\nthis reduction.\nThis work was supported by the Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK\n(GR\/T09149 and EP\/H019839).\nReferences\n1.
