In the case of B-doped Si, \u0004 takes the form\n\u0004 = \u0004i\u00061 + \u0001CBg\/ni\u0002exp\u0007\u2212 EFi \u2212 EnpkT \b\t , \u00011\u0002\nwhere kT has the usual meaning, \u0004i is the intrinsic SPEG\nvelocity at T, CB is the electrically active B concentration at\nthe growth interface, g is the degeneracy factor \u00011.5\u00020.2\u0002, ni\nis the intrinsic carrier concentration7 at T, EF\ni is the intrinsic\nFermi level \u00010.55 eV\u0002, and Enp is the acceptor energy level for\nB \u00010.20\u00020.02 eV\u0002. By convention, all energy levels are\nmeasured relative to the top of the valence band.6\nFrom an atomistic standpoint, growth results from crys-\ntal island nucleation at the growth interface with subsequent\nin-plane migration of island ledges.8,9 The GFLS model pro-\nposes that individual nuclei may possess charge states such\nthat the total nucleation rate \u0001with \u0003ij =0\u0002 is given by\n\u0006n\u00010\u0002\u22121=\u0006n\ni \u00010\u0002\u22121+\u0006n\np\u00010\u0002\u22121, where \u0006n\ni \u00010\u0002\u22121 and \u0006n\np\u00010\u0002\u22121 are the\nstress-free nucleation rates of uncharged and positively\ncharged nuclei in p-type material. Thus, in the case of\ncharged nuclei, nucleation kinetics will be Fermi level de-\npendent. Assuming a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann approximation\n\u0001reasonable for dilute dopant levels\u0002 and using the usual ex-\npression for Fermi level as a function of doping, it can be\nshown that\n\u0006n\u00010\u0002\u22121 = \u0006n\ni \u00010\u0002\u22121\u00061 + \u0001CBg\/ni\u0002exp\u0007\u2212 EFi \u2212 EnpkT \b\t \u00012\u0002\nin B-doped Si.10 In conjunction with recent work11,12 where\nthe stress-free growth velocity was shown to be given by\n\u0004=2\u0007x\u0006n\u00010\u0002\u22121, where \u0007x is the monolayer spacing\n\u00010.14 nm\u0002, Eq. \u00011\u0002 may be rewritten as\n\u0004 =\n2\u0007x\n\u0006n\ni \u00010\u0002\u00061 + \u0001CBg\/ni\u0002exp\u0007\u2212 EFi \u2212 EnpkT \b\t . \u00013\u0002\nIn terms of stressed-SPEG, recent work in intrinsic \u0001001\u0002\nSi advanced \u0004 as a function of uniaxial stress in the plane of\nthe growth front \u0001\u000311\u0002 of the form\n\u0004 =\n\u0007x\n\u0006n\ni \u00010\u0002 + 2\u22123\/2\u0006m,11\ni \u00010\u0002exp\u0007\u2212 \u0007V11m,11\u000311kT \b\n+\n\u0007x\n\u0006n\ni \u00010\u0002 + 2\u22123\/2\u0006m,11\ni \u00010\u0002\n, \u00014\u0002\nwhere \u0006m,11\ni \u00010\u0002 is the intrinsic \u0003ij =0 time for ledge migration\nalong 1 and \u0007V11\nm,11 is the activation volume for ledge migra-\ntion along 1 in the 1 direction.

A\nconsequence of Eq. \u00014\u0002 is that \u0004 has finite limits.

No detectable stress\nrelaxation occurred during annealing. Growth was examined\nusing cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy\n\u0001XTEM\u0002. Approximately 70 XTEM specimens \u000310 \nm\nlong were prepared via site-specific focused ion beam \u0001FIB\u0002\nmilling within a distance of \u00023 mm from the strip centers to\nminimize the presence of any thermal gradient. Due to the\nvery small specimen length to strip length ratio, it is reason-\nably assumed no intraspecimen stress gradients existed.\nFigures 1\u0001a\u0002 and 1\u0001e\u0002 display XTEM micrographs of the\nas-implanted structure indicating an initial \u0005-Si layer\n365\u00025 nm thick. The error in all \u0005-Si thickness \u0001and Si\ngrowth\u0002 measurements is given as the root mean squared\nroughness of the \u0005\/crystalline interface. Annealing for 7.0 h\nwith \u000311=0 resulted in 328\u00023 nm of growth with a planar\n\u0005\/crystalline interface, as shown in Fig. 1\u0001f\u0002. End of range\ndefects from ion implantation were present in all samples. In\nthe case of annealing for 7.0 h with \u000311=\u22120.25, \u22120.5, and\n\u22121.0 GPa, shown in Figs. 1\u0001b\u0002\u20131\u0001d\u0002, 83\u000225, 64\u000214, and\n57\u000210 nm of growth occurred which is less than the \u000311\n=0 case. The growth interface was observed to roughen sig-\nnificantly with \u000311\u000b0, presumably due to kinetically driven\ninstabilities.11,13 In contrast, annealing with \u000311=0.5 and\n1.0 GPa, shown in Figs. 1\u0001g\u0002 and 1\u0001h\u0002, produced nominally\nthe same amount of growth as the \u000311=0 case. These obser-\nvations are qualitatively consistent with recent studies of in-\ntrinsic stressed SPEG.11,12\nThe \u0005-Si thickness as a function of anneal time was\nmeasured for different \u000311 as shown in Fig. 2. The implanted\nCB profile as measured using secondary ion mass spectrom-\netry \u0001SIMS\u0002 is superimposed in Fig. 2 indicating a peak CB\nof \u00033.0\u00011020 cm\u22123 \u0003200 nm deep. In cases of 0&nbsp;\n\b\u000311\b1.0 GPa, the \u0005-Si thickness versus time behavior\nwas nominally the same for all \u000311 in this range and thus\nonly the \u000311=0 set of data is reported for clarity. The growth\nkinetics for \u000311\u000b0 were greatly retarded compared to the\n0\b\u000311 cases. For all \u000311, the growth kinetics appears to vary\nwith anneal time and increase with CB as reported by\nothers.3\u20136\nFigure 3 displays a plot of \u0004 versus CB for different \u000311\nestimated from the data of Fig. 2 using the following\nmethod: \u00011\u0002 the average growth rate between two subsequent\nanneal times was calculated as the change in \u0005-Si thickness\nbetween the anneal times divided by the time interval \u0001this is\nthe reported \u0004\u0002 and \u00012\u0002 the median value of CB over the \u0005-Si\nthickness interval was obtained \u0001this is the reported CB\u0002.

It is also evident from Fig. 3 that clear \u0004t\nand approximate \u0004c limits at a given CB are observed as\nindicated.\nSince \u0004 versus CB is constant for 0\b\u000311, it is reasonable\nto extend Eq. \u00013\u0002 to \u0004=\u0004t.

The values of g and\n\u0007E are in good agreement with those from the GFLS model.6\nThus, it appears 0\u000b\u000311 does not appreciably alter EF\ni\n\u2212En\np\n.\nThe results support the assumption of ni being stress inde-\npendent. However, considering the vast body of prior work\nregarding stress-induced band structure changes,16\u201320 it may\nalso be the case that application of 0\u000b\u000311 induces compen-\nsating alterations to EF\ni and En\np such that EF\ni\n\u2212En\np remains\nconstant.\nFigure 3 also displays the estimated \u0004t \/\u0004c versus CB be-\nhavior.

In intrinsic SPEG, \u000311 does not alter nucleation\nkinetics as per the activation volume tensor for crystal island\nformation \u0001\u0007Vij\nn \u0002.11,12 Presumably, \u0007Vij\nn for charged nuclei is\nof the same form. Thus, an explanation for the retarded\nnucleation kinetics with \u000311\t0 is due to stress-induced\nchanges in the Si band structure. Assuming the GFLS model\nis valid for in-plane compression, it therefore appears that\n\u000311\u000b0 increases ni and\/or increases EF\ni\n\u2212En\np\n.\nThe results of this study suggest dopant and stress influ-\nences in SPEG may be synergistic. This is an important re-\nsult as prior work of combined dopant- and stress-influenced\nSPEG assumed the two influences were independent.13\u201315 In\nparticular, synergy would be important to consider in any\nSPEG simulations.22\nOf course, there are several challenges in this work. Ac-\ncurately characterizing \u0004 as a function of CB with a variable\ndopant profile is difficult, especially due to the ex situ nature\nof the experiments. Another issue is growth interface rough-\nening with \u000311\u000b0 which is partly stress driven, but is also\ndopant gradient driven.13 Prior work of intrinsic SPEG with\n\u000311\t0 observed roughening nearly an order of magnitude\nless than that observed herein.11,12 A possible way to avoid\nthese issues in future work would be to use Si wafers with\nepitaxial layers with constant CB.\nIn summary, the influence of combined dopant- and\nstress-influenced SPEG of amorphized \u0001001\u0002 Si was investi-\ngated. As per the GFLS model of dopant-enhanced SPEG, it\nappears stress may alter the Si electronic structure such that\ndopant and stress influences are synergistic in growth kinet-\nics.\nThe authors acknowledge the Semiconductor Research\nCorporation \u0001Task ID 1372.003\u0002 for funding this research.\nThe Major Analytical Instrumentation Center at the\nUniversity of Florida is acknowledged for use of the FIB and\nTEM facilities.\n1G.
