Television images showed protestors dressed in Red Shirts \nusing slingshots to fight soldiers armed with guns and tanks while shops and buildings burnt. \n \nTo some observers, these events were a class-based movement of poor people from Thailand\u2019s rural zones \nprotesting at an undemocratic government and the lack of inclusion in economic development (e.g. Ungpakorn, \n2010). \n \nBut there is also evidence that these protests \u2013 while based on a large component of mass protest from poorer \npeople - were also carefully managed street theatre. Rather than demonstrating the power of a workers\u2019 \nmovement, a variety of factors suggest these conflicts represented clever opportunism of the deposed prime \nminister, Thaksin Shinawatra combined with a variety of symbolic actions by the poorer activists. This \ncombination of influences meant that the conflicts in 2010 were not a unified class-based movement, but an \nalliance of actors using sporadic and not always successful tactics to influence Thai politics. \n \nWhat insights can the 2010 Red Shirt protests of Thailand offer to social movement studies? \n \nBackground \nOn the face of it, Thailand has good reason to experience political conflict on the grounds of inequality. \nThailand\u2019s rapid growth as an economic power since the 1970s has not simply occurred through industrialization, \nbut also through a long-term and planned centralization of political power. In part, this political concentration \nwas a deliberate ploy during the Cold War and Vietnam War to maintain Thailand as a capitalist and pro-West \nstate among socialist neighbors (Glassman, 2004). Thailand has experienced military rule for most of its history \nsince its establishment as a modern kingdom in 1932. For large parts of the 1970s, many rural areas were strictly \ncontrolled for national security. Democratic elections (beyond short-term experiments) were held initially only in \n1988, and even then disturbed by military coups in 1991 and 2006. \n \nThis concentration of power has also reflected, and indeed perhaps caused by, the growth of Bangkok. Bangkok \nis some 40 times larger than Thailand\u2019s next city of Chiang Mai, and Bangkok\u2019s elites have usually ruled \nThailand. Most prime ministers since military rule have been retired generals, who have often created political \nparties based on their own personalities and supporters rather than pre-defined political positions of left and right. \nMoreover, Thailand\u2019s aristocratic classes also carry power \u2013 although analysts disagree about the individual role \nof the king himself (Handley, 2006). King Bhumiphol Adulyadej has ruled since 1946, and has occupied a \nposition of usually unparalleled support from Thai society. He clearly intervened to reduce military power in \n1973 and, less strongly, in 1992. But his visible role since then has been much less. \n 3 \n \nResponses to the military elite, however, have been slight. The Communist Party of Thailand swelled following \nmilitary crackdowns during the 1970s, but quickly weakened in the 1980s. Since the 1980s, many villagers \nprotested that they were not included in the immense growth experienced in Bangkok \u2013 or against infrastructure \nprojects such as dams or power plants if they threatened livelihoods (Forsyth, 2007). But these protests rarely \nslowed down Thailand\u2019s modernization. They also did not lead to an identifiable and long-term left-wing, or pro-\npoor, source of political power. During the 1990s, a coalition of rural associations and trade unions emerged \nunder the name the Assembly of the Poor, which supported rural protests, and sometimes took to Bangkok\u2019s \nstreets (Missingham, 2004). But the Assembly diminished in the late 1990s, perhaps coincidentally with the \nAsian financial crises, and perhaps because of the rise of Thaksin Shinawatra. \n \nThe rise of Thaksin \nThe immediate origins of the 2010 conflicts can be linked to the rise of Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister of \nThailand. \n \nThaksin broke the mold for various reasons. First, Thaksin did not come from Thailand\u2019s older elites, but instead \nwas born in Chiang Mai from a relatively lower class background as a police officer. He then made a fortune on \nthe back of a state-allocated monopoly for providing mobile phones and communications in the 1980s-1990s. \nThaksin was one of the growing number of Thailand\u2019s new business elite, whose success did not depend on \nhistoric ties to the army or royal family (Baker and Pasuk, 2009). \n \nSecond, Thaksin overtly targeted the poorer rural voters of Thailand in order to get electoral support. When he \nturned to politics in the late 1990s, he adopted a populist program, and deliberately asked rural voters what they \nwanted out of government. In addition, Thaksin appealed because he was recognizable as a winner in business, \nand a long-wanted solution to the problems of the financial crisis. He created the popularly-named Thai Rak Thai \nparty (\u2018Thais Love Thais\u2019), which won support from the rural heartlands of northern and northeastern Thailand \n(McCargo and Ukrist, 2005). \n \nThai Rak Thai was elected in 2001, and Thaksin became Thailand\u2019s first prime minister to remain in power for \nhis elected period. He was then re-elected with a larger vote in 2005. Thai Rak Thai  passed some of Thailand\u2019s \nmost progressive reforms for poorer citizens, including a universal cheap health care program (the \u201930 baht \nscheme\u2019), cheap loans for villagers (the \u2018One million baht village loan scheme\u2019), and marketing of products made \nby each locality (\u2018One tambol one product\u2019). \n \nBut Thaksin also attracted criticism for alleged corruption and misuse of power. He was blamed for mishandling \nand inciting the violence in Thailand\u2019s Muslim far south. Thaksin often acted like someone who did not know the \ndifference between his own responsibility and that of the country. (Famously, he once claimed to be buying \n 4 \nLiverpool Football Club, and then implied that this would be paid for out of Thai public money: observers \nbelieve this was a public relations trick). \n \nMost controversially, Thaksin fell from grace rapidly when he sold his family business, the Shin Corporation to \nthe rival Singapore sovereign wealth fund and avoided paying tax in 2006. A new political organization, the \nPeople\u2019s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), arose to challenge Thaksin directly. This organization, led by a \nprevious business associate of Thaksin plus a rival politician, organized street protests in Bangkok with \nsupporters dressed in yellow shirts \u2013 the color used to celebrate the King\u2019s birthday \u2013 and consequently became \nknown as the \u2018Yellow Shirts.\u2019 Declaring that they \u2018fight for the King,\u2019 and declaring Thaksin to be a secret \nrepublican, they urged Thaksin to step down. One Yellow Shirt leader also controversially claimed rural voters \ncould not be trusted to vote because they lacked sufficient knowledge and judgment. Thaksin, while denying any \nopposition to the royalty, finally agreed to step down in 2006. But, apparently worried that he might not do so, \nthe army intervened in September 2006 and deposed Thaksin in a coup. \n \nThe 2006 coup and aftermath \nThe army justified the 2006 coup was on the grounds of restoring national security and protecting the monarchy. \nRumors suggested the coup was particularly backed by the Queen and the head of Thailand\u2019s Privy Council (and \nex-prime minister), General Prem Tinsulanonda. Many Thai people either saw the coup as a necessary evil, or \ndespaired that military tactics should overthrow democracy yet again (Funston, 2009). \n \nThe military government ruled for just over one year. It passed a new constitution that increased the regulation of \nprime ministers. It also disbanded the Thai Rak Thai party, and undertook legal action against alleged corruption \nby Thaksin and his wife. But in the general elections of December 2007, the winners were the Palang \nPrachachon (\u2018People Power\u2019) party \u2013 a new force, funded by Thaksin and modeled on Thai Rak Thai. Ironically, \nhowever, the initial leader of this party, Samak Sundaravej, had a reputation for opposing pro-democracy \ndemonstrations during the 1970s. \n \nThis new party, however, did not last long. In October 2008, the Yellow Shirts seized Bangkok\u2019s two airports to \ndemand that the government step down because it represented the interests of a deposed and discredited prime \nminister. This protest coincided with an official investigation into alleged electoral malpractice by Palang \nPrachachon. When the party was found guilty of buying votes during the 2007 election, it stood down, and was \ndisbanded with two other parties. In resulting inter-party negotiations, a new coalition led by the Prachathipat \n(Democrat) party arose took office. This new government was constitutionally legitimate \u2013 but it was not based \non the majority of the electoral vote, and indeed was supported by the Yellow Shirt faction. The government tried \nto restore stability to Thailand, but continued to press charges against Thaksin, eventually finding him guilty of \nmisusing his power; sentencing him to two years in jail if he returned to Thailand; and, in early 2010, seizing 1.4 \nbillion dollars of Thaksin\u2019s assets. \n \n 5 \nBut this new government also attracted a new form of political opposition. A parallel group to the PAD emerged, \ncalling itself the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), which represented the interests of the \ndeposed political parties and of Thaksin. These protestors became known as the Red Shirts, to distinguish them \nfrom the yellow, and to hint at their relatively poorer support. In March 2009, they invaded a meeting of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations and sites in Bangkok, causing embarrassment to the government and a \nstrong police response. Then, in 2010, they arrived in their thousands in central Bangkok. \n \n2010: Mobilization or symbolism? \nAccording to left-wing analysts such as Giles Ungpakorn, the 2010 Red Shirt protests are an unsurprising, and \nindeed inevitable response of Thailand\u2019s poor to decades of being ignored, and by the increasingly unjustified \nattempts of Thailand\u2019s military and royal elite to control Thailand (Ungpakorn, 2007, 2010). These analysts point \nto the \u2018unelected\u2019 status of the current government, the existence of a coup to overthrow Thaksin, and the refusal \nto settle problems through new general elections. They also point out how no-one involved in occupying \nBangkok\u2019s airports in 2008 has been prosecuted, despite the negative impact on Thailand\u2019s reputation and \nthousands of businesses. \n \nMoreover, these analysts claim that the Red Shirts protests were funded by villages and community organizations \nin rural Thailand, and then supported in Bangkok by the urban working classes who provided food and money. \nThe historic organizational structure of the Assembly of the Poor provided a means to bring rural protestors \ntogether, and take them to Bangkok. These analyses portray the Red Shirts as a locally governed, poor-people\u2019s \nmovement interested in social justice. \n \nOther evidence, however, suggests that Thaksin or his supporters seized opportunistically on this longer-term \ndisaffection in order to distil a crisis in 2010. Unsubstantiated claims say that representatives of the Pheua Thai \n(\u2018For Thais\u2019) party \u2013 the pro-Thaksin party that has succeeded the now defunct Palang Prachachon \u2013 offered \nmoney to villagers in the northeast to attend rallies in Bangkok.1 They also offered large payments in the event of \ndeath and the cancellation of village debts if the new party were elected. Political activism in Thailand of course \nis full of such precedents, and indeed Thaksin was claimed to fund the Assembly of the Poor during the 1990s \nbecause it helped destabilize the then government (Baker and Pasuk, 2009). It would be unfair to suggest that \nThaksin paid all protestors; or that protestors were Thaksin\u2019s \u2018stooges.\u2019 But the role of Thaksin seems integral to \nform and purpose of these protests in 2010, with the explicit intention of calling new elections after the deposal \nof Thaksin and the legal and financial actions against him. \n \nThere are also other uncertainties. Newspaper reports claim that the Red Shirts contained some men (sometimes \ndressed in black) who carried automatic weapons and who shot at the police and the army \u2013 although Red Shirt \nleaders deny these men existed. Were these men fictional inventions of the government in order to justify the \nlater crackdown? Or were they agent provocateurs among the Red Shirts who sought to escalate the violence? \nCertainly, some eight government soldiers were killed by gunshots during the protests. Similarly, some acts of \n 6 \nviolence inside Bangkok \u2013 such as grenade explosions outside army buildings \u2013 were also described as evidence \nfor both terrorism and government manipulation by both sides. \n \nAlso, were there different components among the Red Shirts that eventually became splits in the movement? \nTwo weeks before the eventual crackdown, newspapers reported that the protestors and the government had \nreached an apparent truce by calling for general elections later in 2010. This apparent agreement was then \nreportedly rejected by the Red Shirt leaders. Did the Red Shirts refuse to trust the government? Or was it because \nthe Red Shirt commanders hoped that the fastest response would come from forcing a confrontation in front of \nthe world\u2019s cameras? \n \nThe protests of 2010, moreover, were full of imagery and symbolism: the vivid colors of the red-shirted \nprotestors; the prominence of many women among them, often holding young children aloft in front of barricades \nand cameras. Many Red Shirts protestors were happy to be filmed using slingshots against the armed soldiers \n(despite the claims many protestors had guns). Was this a form of street theatre to command attention? Indeed, \nthe protests began by Red Shirt protestors donating their own blood, and then pouring it, symbolically, under the \ngates of parliament house. All of these acts show that the Red Shirts were happy to be portrayed as powerless \npeasants. \n \nBut despite the violence facing the Red Shirt protestors, one final question is who would benefit most from this \nconflict? The likely winners of a general election would be the Pheau Thai party \u2013 the latest manifestation of \nThaksin\u2019s political representatives. This party adopts an overtly pro-Thaksin stance, yet is also led by previous \nprime-minister, General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. As with the leader of the previous People Power Party, this man \nhas often been characterized as disinterested in pro-poor political reform, and indeed has a reputation for \nenhancing his own business interests while in office despite costs to communities and environment (Fahn, 2003). \n \nMaking sense of 2010 \nIt seems hard to escape the conclusion that the Red Shirt protests of 2010 were a calculated coalition between \ntwo broad sets of interests. On one hand were the lower and middle-income peasantries of Thailand\u2019s north and \nnortheast who believe \u2013 with some justification \u2013 that development in Thailand is avoiding them. On the other \nhand were Thaksin Shinawatra and his supporters who wish to oppose the current regime, unfreeze his assets, \nand even possibly allow Thaksin to return to power. \n \nIn this sense, it seems both sides are using each other \u2013 the peasants to gain funding and political visibility \u2013 and \nThaksin to mobilize people to destabilize the government. After all, this is a similar situation when Thai Rak Thai \nwas elected in the early 2000s. Thaksin mobilized poorer voters to allow him to gain power. We should not be \nsurprised if voters support him if he also provides them with benefits (Walker, 2008). \n \n 7 \nMoreover, the conflicts in Thailand also demonstrate different strategies of political mobilization and symbolism. \nThaksin\u2019s electoral success was based on him offering direct benefits to Thailand\u2019s majority voters from the rural \nlower classes. The Yellow Shirts cannot outnumber the Red Shirts, but they adopt the symbolism of the King to \nclaim authority. Ironically, this strategy might have backfired because it might have encouraged the King not to \nrisk intervening against the Red Shirt protests because his name was already adopted by the Yellows. If the Red \nShirts had refused to respond to the King then his authority would be severely damaged. \n \nMeanwhile, the Red Shirts relied on the symbols of sacrifice, spilled blood, mothers and children, and \npowerlessness that have been used in various ways by similar protests since the 1990s. These different \nsymbolisms add power to the Yellow Shirts (who cannot rely on the sheer number of votes) and to the Red Shirts \n(who might be numerically strong, but face opposition from the entrenched interests of the army and upper \nclasses). \n \nBut which groups benefited most from the protests? At the moment, it seems the current government has lost \nprestige internationally, but it is still in power, and has not announced plans for a general election. Indeed, the \nsuppression of the Red Shirts seems to have won support from many people in Bangkok and Thailand who have \nsought an end to the violence, and who despised the lawbreaking of the Red Shirts. \n \nThaksin and his supporters seem to have lost for the time being. The attempt to destabilize the government has \nfailed. But Thaksin\u2019s funds can still \u2013 at present \u2013 support further general elections.  \n \nThe poorer protestors, however, are in a different position. There is still no political party with an obvious agenda \nfor addressing the interests of poorer rural areas. The violence and burning of Thailand\u2019s largest shopping mall, \nCentral World, have also weakened their legitimacy. Thailand has seen many protests by militant activists from \nrural areas since the 1990s, but apart from Thai Rak Thai\u2019s policies of the early 2000s, few governments have \nadopted an overt and comprehensive \u2018pro-poor\u2019 policy position. Indeed, is it possible that the Red Shirt protestors \n\u2013 the ones facing the bullets in central Bangkok \u2013 were sent there by elites in order to swap one self-interested \nregime for another? \n \nThe answer \u2013 so far \u2013 seems to be that enough Red Shirt protestors were willing to risk that possibility in order to \nmaximize their own interests. It seems entirely rational for citizens who feel marginalized from Bangkok\u2019s \npolitics to support a political figure such as Thaksin who has provided them leadership and benefits in the past. \nThe protests also gave international attention to inequality in Thailand, and the perceived lack of justice in the \npolitical system. In time, such publicity and public show of strength might pay greater dividends. \n \nBut despite these genuine concerns about inequality in Thailand, the immediate causes of the Red Shirt protests \u2013 \nas they occurred in 2010 \u2013 seem to lie elsewhere. Much as many would like to see the Red Shirt protests of 2010 \nas a mass mobilization based of poorer classes seeking to overthrow an entrenched elite, evidence suggests the \n 8 \npurpose and formation of events reflected a series of planned and opportunistic actions by a combination of \ndifferent actors. These different actors were, firstly, the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who \nbrought his financial power and personal desire for retribution to the conflict; and, secondly, many poorer \nactivists, who \u2013 with varying levels of militancy \u2013 wanted to exploit the opportunity posed by Thaksin\u2019s \ndilemma and probable funding to use his case to force Thailand\u2019s elites to take the lower classes more seriously. \nIn turn, these actions triggered additional symbolic tactics of calling on most Thai people\u2019s loyalty to the King; \nportraying the Red Shirts as lawless; and of the Red Shirts themselves presenting their members as unarmed \nvictims. Despite the appearance of the Red Shirts as a mass labor movement, the main victor of this protest \nwould always have been Thaksin Shinawatra, one of Thailand\u2019s greatest capitalists. \n \nThe events of 2010, however, will of course not be the end of the story. When general elections come again, we \ncan expect to see political parties seeking to court rural votes. Some parties will represent old military elites, and \nothers will be funded by new business leaders. It is unclear whether Thaksin will still be allowed to fund electoral \nparties. The ability to call on the symbolism of royalty is also fading. \n \nYet, perhaps the clearest lessons of the Thai conflicts of 2010 are that the entrenched Bangkok elites are opposed \nby an alliance of a new business elite and lower classes \u2013 but that these allies are not always working for each \nother. Moreover, in the short term at least, the blunt force of numbers of votes and protestors can be withheld by \na more symbolic force of how different actors portray themselves and appeal to what is considered legitimate in \nThai society. This tactic has been used most prominently by the weaker voices \u2013 the electorally smaller Yellow \nshirts, who call upon tradition and the monarchy \u2013 and the still-unsuccessful Red Shirts, who have evoked \nimages of victimhood and poverty. These symbolic acts are effective tools for social activists when fighting from \na weaker position. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBaker, C. and Pasuk Pongpaichit (2009) Thaksin (2nd edition), Seattle: University of Washington Press. \n \nFahn, J.
