INTRODUCTION\nCollective decisions are ubiquitous in complex democratic societies.\nElections, referenda, decisions in legislatures, committees, multimem-\nber courts, expert panels, and boards of companies or other organi-\nzations are all examples. In such decisions, disagreement is equally ubiq-\nuitous. People disagree with each other on many levels. They disagree\nnot only on what choices should be made but also on why those choices\nshould be made.\nPolitical theorists have offered different accounts of how collective\ndecisions should be made under conditions of pluralism and when\nsuch decisions are legitimate. Obviously, different decision problems\nmay require different decision procedures or different criteria of le-\ngitimacy. But, even for a given decision problem, rival accounts of how\nto solve the problem, which differ on several dimensions, are usually\non offer. In this article, I focus on one such dimension: the importance\nassigned not only to the choices made (the \u201cwhat\u201d question) but also\nto the reasons underlying those choices (the \u201cwhy\u201d question). This di-\nmension can be seen as a spectrum between two extremes: the minimal\nliberal account at one end and the comprehensive deliberative account at\nthe other.\nThe minimal liberal account emphasizes the \u201cwhat\u201d question, the\ncomprehensive deliberative account the \u201cwhy\u201d question. The minimal\nliberal account holds that collective decisions should be made only on\n* An earlier version of this article was presented at the colloquium on law, economics,\nand politics, New York University Law School, September 2004. I am grateful to the\nparticipants at this colloquium for a challenging and helpful discussion. I especially thank\nSteven Brams, Franz Dietrich, John Ferejohn, Lewis Kornhauser, Philip Pettit, and the\neditors and referees of Ethics for helpful comments, suggestions, and editorial advice.\nList Discursive Dilemma 363\npractical actions or policies and that the reasons (or justifications) un-\nderlying those decisions should be kept private. The comprehensive\ndeliberative account, by contrast, stresses the importance of giving rea-\nsons for collective decisions, where those reasons should themselves be\ncollectively decided.\nConsider a decision to protect a natural habitat. On the minimal\nliberal account, it is sufficient to reach agreement on a protection policy,\nwithout agreeing on the reasons supporting that policy. On the com-\nprehensive deliberative account, these reasons should also be publicly\nconsidered and decided. There could be many such reasons, and, de-\nspite agreeing that the habitat should be protected, people may still\ndisagree on whether this should be done for aesthetic, recreational,\neconomic, religious, or other reasons.\nWhile these two extreme positions are ideal types, several influential\naccounts, including variants of Dworkin\u2019s, Pettit\u2019s, Rawls\u2019s, and Sun-\nstein\u2019s accounts, can be placed at more intermediate positions between\nthem, as discussed below. One might also defend a minimal liberal\naccount (or something similar) for some decision problems while de-\nfending a comprehensive deliberative account (or something similar)\nfor others.\nMy aim in this article is to compare the minimal liberal and com-\nprehensive deliberative accounts on the basis of a formal model devel-\noped in the growing literature on the \u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d and \u201cjudg-\nment aggregation.\u201d1 This model can represent the two accounts in a\nunified framework, albeit in a simplified form. I address several ques-\ntions: What is the trade-off between the (minimal liberal) demand for\nreaching agreement on outcomes and the (comprehensive deliberative)\ndemand for reason giving? How large should the \u201csphere of public\nreason\u201d be? When do the decision procedures suggested by the two\naccounts agree and when do they conflict? How good are these pro-\ncedures at tracking the truth in decisions involving matters of fact? What\n1. The \u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d was first discussed in a legal context under the name\n\u201cdoctrinal paradox\u201d by Kornhauser and Sager (1986, 1993, 2004), Kornhauser (1992),\nand Chapman (1998). Brennan (2001) and Pettit (2001a), who introduced the name\n\u201cdiscursive dilemma,\u201d reinterpreted the \u201cdoctrinal paradox\u201d as a broader problem of\n\u201ccollective (in)coherence.\u201d Generalizing the \u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d by drawing on Arrow\u2019s\n(1951) axiomatic approach to social choice theory, List and Pettit (2002, 2004) have\ndeveloped a formal model of judgment aggregation and proved a simple impossibility\ntheorem. Further technical results and generalizations of the model have been obtained\nby Pauly and van Hees (2005), Dietrich (2005a, 2005b), List (2003, 2004), Dietrich and\nList (2004b, 2005), Pigozzi (2005), Ga\u00a8rdenfors (2005), Nehring and Puppe (2005), and\nDokow and Holzman (2005). Bovens and Rabinowicz (2005) and List (2005) have dis-\ncussed the \u201cdiscursive dilemma\u201d from the perspective of the Condorcet jury theorem.\n364 Ethics January 2006\nstrategic incentives do they generate for decision makers? Answers to\nthese questions allow us to compare the strengths and weaknesses of\nthe two accounts in relation to different decision problems.\nAfter introducing the two accounts in Section II, I argue in Section\nIII that they can be associated with different decision procedures\u2014\n\u201cconclusion-\u201d and \u201cpremise-based\u201d ones\u2014which may generate different\noutcomes for the same decision problem: the \u201cdiscursive dilemma.\u201d In\nSection IV, I introduce the concept of the public agenda, and in Section\nV, I identify a trade-off between some general demands on collective\ndecision making and assess how the conclusion- and premise-based pro-\ncedures solve the trade-off. Sections VI and VII address, respectively, the\ntruth-tracking capacities of the two procedures in factual decisions and\nthe incentives they generate for decision makers. In Section VIII, I\nconclude and ask whether the premise- and conclusion-based proce-\ndures can be embedded in a unified account of collective decision mak-\ning that constitutes a compromise between the minimal liberal and\ncomprehensive deliberative extremes.\nAlthough the two ideal-typical accounts discussed here are less sub-\ntle than many accounts defended in the literature, a comparison of the\nideal types can still shed light on many characteristics that intermediate\naccounts have in common with them.\nII. TWO ACCOUNTS OF COLLECTIVE DECISION MAKING\nThe Minimal Liberal Account\nThe minimal liberal account holds that it is (often) sufficient to make\ncollective decisions only on specific actions or policies, while leaving\nunderlying reasons undecided. Inspired by Sunstein (1994), I call such\ndecisions incompletely theorized ones.2 The minimal liberal account holds\nthat making collective decisions on more fundamental reasons is (often)\nnot only unnecessary but also infeasible and undesirable. It is unnec-\nessary because such reasons are practically irrelevant once there is\nenough agreement on the specific decision made. It is infeasible because\npeople may fail to reach agreement on such reasons. It is undesirable\nbecause people may find some reasons offensive and divisive, even when\nthey agree on the resulting decision.\nAs noted above, a policy to protect a natural habitat may be widely\nsupported, even when people disagree about why the habitat should be\nprotected. If it were decided that it should be protected to respect God\u2019s\n2. Crucially, Sunstein\u2019s own account of \u201cincompletely theorized agreements\u201d refers\nonly to judicial decisions; elsewhere Sunstein is a defender of deliberative democracy with\nregard to political decisions. Here I use the notion of \u201cincomplete theorization\u201d in a more\ngeneral sense than intended by Sunstein so as to apply not only to judicial decisions, but\nto any kinds of collective decisions.\nList Discursive Dilemma 365\ncreation, this might offend an atheist environmentalist or someone of\nanother religion, who would otherwise happily endorse protecting the\nhabitat. Similarly, the citizens of a liberal state may agree that human\nbeings have inalienable rights, while disagreeing on where these rights\ncome from. If the state were to take a particular philosophical stance\non the source of human rights, this might alienate citizens with a dif-\nferent philosophical view, who endorse human rights for different rea-\nsons. Also, if there is broad support for human rights, it is unclear what\nthe state would gain by committing itself to a particular stance on the\nsource of those rights. In summary, on the minimal liberal account,\nincompletely theorized agreements are essential for the functioning of\na pluralistic society, which is characterized by irresolvable disagreements\non \u201chigher-order\u201d reasons.\nThe Comprehensive Deliberative Account\nIn contrast to the minimal liberal account, the comprehensive delib-\nerative account holds that it is (often) insufficient to make collective\ndecisions merely on specific actions or policies, without making the\nunderlying reasons public. The account demands what Pettit (2001b)\ncalls the \u201ccollectivization of reason\u201d: it holds that it is (often) necessary\nfor democratic legitimacy to supplement collective decisions on actions\nor policies with supporting reasons.3 These reasons should themselves\nbe collectively decided and publicly defensible. On this account, it is\nnot enough for the legitimacy of an action or policy that the majority\nendorses this action or policy. Such majority endorsement might stem\nfrom a spontaneous majority passion or lack any reasoned justification.\nThe comprehensive deliberative account proposes two demands to\nprevent majority tyranny or unreasoned majority decisions and to en-\nhance democratic legitimacy. First, collective decisions should be sup-\nported by publicly decided reasons; second, the overall system of col-\nlectively decided reasons and outcomes should be coherent. I call the\nfirst the conversability demand and the second the integrity demand, inspired\nby Pettit (2001a) and Dworkin (1986), respectively.4 An agent is con-\nversable if she can justify her actions by giving appropriate reasons for\n3. Pettit\u2019s precise understanding of the collectivization of reason goes further; he\nthinks of a group as collectivizing reason when it holds itself as a collectivity to the demands\nof reason.\n4. On \u201cconversability,\u201d see also Pettit and Smith (1996). Dworkin\u2019s account of \u201cin-\ntegrity\u201d concerns judicial interpretation rather than collective decision making more gen-\nerally. Here I use the notion of \u201cintegrity\u201d in a more general sense than intended by\nDworkin.\n366 Ethics January 2006\nthese actions. An agent displays integrity if she is coherent in her judg-\nments or decisions across multiple issues and\/or across time.5\nIt is a familiar requirement that individual agents should be con-\nversable and display integrity in this way. To defend their actions when\nchallenged, individuals are usually expected to give reasons for these\nactions: they are expected to be conversable. Likewise, individuals are\nusually expected to be rational, which requires coherence of their sys-\ntems of judgments or decisions: a demand of integrity. The compre-\nhensive deliberative account extends these requirements to groups.\nComparing the Two Accounts\nThe minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts view the\nrelation between reason giving and the stability and legitimacy of col-\nlective decisions very differently. One sees reason giving as unnecessary\nfor, and potentially threatening to, stability and legitimacy, the other as\nconducive to, and potentially necessary for, it. To make a collective\ndecision stable and legitimate, on the minimal liberal account, the de-\ncision must be as neutral as possible between different supporting rea-\nsons, as there may be irresolvable disagreements on such reasons. On\nthe comprehensive deliberative account, by contrast, the decision must\nbe supported by appropriate reasons, which are also collectively decided\nand publicly defensible.\nThe minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts are\nsimplified ideals, but several accounts in the literature\u2014or variants of\nsuch accounts\u2014can be placed at intermediate positions between them.\nAt the risk of oversimplification, here are some examples. With regard\nto judicial decisions, Sunstein\u2019s account of \u201cincompletely theorized\nagreements\u201d (1994) is closer to the minimal liberal end of the spectrum,\nwhile Dworkin\u2019s account of \u201cintegrity\u201d in law (1986) is closer to the\ncomprehensive deliberative end. With regard to political decisions,\nRiker\u2019s \u201cliberalism\u201d (as opposed to \u201cpopulism\u201d) (1982) is closer to the\nminimal liberal end, while many accounts of deliberative democracy,\nlike Pettit\u2019s proposals on the \u201ccollectivization of reason\u201d (2001b), are\ncloser to the comprehensive deliberative end. Rawls\u2019s \u201cpolitical liber-\nalism\u201d (1993) is an important compromise position, on which I make\n5. Kornhauser and Sager (2004) suggest a taxonomy of integrity constraints. First, an\nintegrity constraint may be applied to the (1a) political or (1b) judicial realms. Second,\nit may be applied (2a) only to actions or outcomes or (2b) also to supporting reasons and\njustifications. Third, it may be applied (3a) synchronically or (3b) diachronically. Korn-\nhauser and Sager argue that Pettit\u2019s and Dworkin\u2019s accounts of conversability or integrity\noccupy opposite positions on this taxonomy, claiming that Pettit is mainly concerned with\n1a-2b-3a and Dworkin with 1b-2a-3b. But this is not entirely correct, as Pettit also emphasizes\ndiachronic generalizations of the discursive dilemma and argues that the dilemma occurs\nin several realms.\nList Discursive Dilemma 367\nsome remarks below. Of course, the ideal-typical accounts discussed here\nmiss out on many aspects and nuances of the actual accounts held by\nthese authors, but a comparison of the ideals still sheds light on those\ncharacteristics that actually held accounts share with them.\nThe difference between the minimal liberal and comprehensive\ndeliberative accounts might seem to lie only in whether or not the\nreasons behind a collective decision are made public, but not in what\nthe outcome of the decision is. If this were correct, then the choice\nbetween the two accounts would perhaps affect people\u2019s perception of\na collective decision\u2014especially the perceived legitimacy, which might\nbe influenced by the public reasons for the decision\u2014but it would not\naffect the decision made. But I argue that the two accounts suggest the\nuse of two different decision procedures that may lead to different\noutcomes even for the same decision problem.\nIII. THE DISCURSIVE DILEMMA\nExamples\nThe tenure example.\u2014A university committee has to decide whether to\ngive tenure to a junior academic (the outcome or conclusion). The re-\nquirement for tenure is excellence in both teaching and research (the\ntwo reasons or premises). The first among three committee members\nthinks the candidate is excellent in teaching but not in research; the\nsecond thinks she is excellent in research but not in teaching; the third\nthinks she is excellent in both. So a majority considers the candidate\nexcellent in teaching, a majority considers her excellent in research,\nbut only a minority\u2014the third committee member\u2014thinks the candi-\ndate should be given tenure. How should the committee decide?6\nThe global warming example.\u2014An expert policy advisory committee\nhas to judge whether, given present greenhouse gas emissions, there\nwill be significant global warming (the conclusion). The experts con-\nsider two propositions: first, that greenhouse gas emissions are above\nsome critical threshold (the first premise); and second, that, if green-\nhouse gas emissions are above the given threshold, then there will be\nsignificant global warming (the second premise). The two propositions\njointly entail that there will be significant global warming. The first\namong three experts thinks both propositions are true; the second\nthinks the first but not the second is true; the third thinks the second\nbut not the first is true. So a majority considers each proposition true,\nyet a majority believes there will not be significant global warming. What\nadvice should the committee give?7\n6. This example is given in Bovens and Rabinowicz (2005).\n7. This example is given in Dietrich and List (2005); for a related example, see\nKornhauser and Sager (2004).\n368 Ethics January 2006\nThe habitat protection example.\u2014A legislature has to decide whether\nto protect a natural habitat as a national park. There are many possible\nreasons for protecting the habitat. Aesthetic reasons: it is a place of great\nnatural beauty. Ecological reasons: its biodiversity is unique. Religious\nreasons: it is a place of religious significance. Economic reasons: it at-\ntracts ecotourists. Scientific reasons: it provides records of evolutionary\nprocesses. Medical reasons: its flora and fauna provide ingredients for\nnew drugs. Political reasons: protecting the habitat boosts the country\u2019s\nreputation as being environmentally friendly. And so on. Each possible\nreason might serve as a sufficient premise to support the conclusion to\nprotect the habitat. The protection of the habitat is unanimously sup-\nported by the legislators. But the legislature might also seek to agree\non a declaration as to why the habitat should be protected. Every pro-\nposed wording is rejected by a majority. How should the legislators\nproceed?\nEach of these decision problems involves reasons and outcomes or\npremises and conclusions. In the first two examples, the relation be-\ntween premises and conclusion is conjunctive : accepting all premises is\nnecessary and sufficient for accepting the conclusion. In the third ex-\nample, it is disjunctive : accepting at least one premise is sufficient (and\nnecessary, if the premises are exhaustive) for accepting the conclusion.\nLet R1, R2, . . . , Rk denote the premises and C the conclusion. In a\nconjunctive decision problem, the relation between premises and conclusion\nis given by the proposition ; in a disjunctiveC \u2194 (R & R & . . . & R )1 2 k\ndecision problem, by .8C \u2194 (R or R or . . . or R )1 2 k\nTwo Decision Procedures\nAs the minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts assign\ndifferent roles to reasons as opposed to outcomes in collective decisions,\nthey also suggest different procedures for solving conjunctive and dis-\njunctive decision problems. On the minimal liberal account, all that is\nrequired in each case is a decision on the conclusion. This suggests the\nuse of the conclusion-based decision procedure.\nThe conclusion-based procedure.\u2014The group makes a collective judg-\nment on the conclusion (C) by taking a majority vote on that conclusion.\n8. The first and third examples are direct instances of these conjunctive and disjunctive\nforms. The second example can be interpreted as an instance of the conjunctive form\nbut also allows an alternative representation. The two premises can be written as P and\n, and the conclusion as Q; now the precise logical structure of the problem dependsP r Q\non the interpretation of the conditional r. For simplicity, I focus on conjunctive and\ndisjunctive decision problems here. The model of judgment aggregation developed in List\nand Pettit (2002, 2004) and subsequent papers permits any logical relations expressible\nin logic.\nList Discursive Dilemma 369\nThe group abstains from making any collective judgments on the prem-\nises (R1, R2, . . . , Rk).\nIn this way, judgments on the premises remain private. They influ-\nence the collective judgment on the conclusion at most indirectly,\nthrough their influence on the individuals\u2019 judgments on that conclu-\nsion. On the comprehensive deliberative account, by contrast, a decision\non the conclusion is not enough. Rather, the decision has to be sup-\nported by appropriate reasons, which are themselves publicly decided.\nThis suggests the use of the premise-based decision procedure.\nThe premise-based procedure.\u2014The group first makes collective judg-\nments on all premises (R1, R2, . . . , Rk) by taking a majority vote on\neach premise. The group then derives its collective judgment on the\nconclusion (C) from these collective judgments on the premises, using\nthe appropriate logical relation.9\nIn this way, the logical reasoning from the premises to the conclu-\nsion is performed at the collective level; the collective judgment on the\nconclusion is thus consistent with, and supported by, collective judg-\nments on the premises.\nThe premise- and conclusion-based procedures clearly differ in\nwhether or not any collective judgments are made on the premises, but\nthey may also differ in the collective judgment they generate on the\nconclusion, as shown next. This problem has become known as the\n\u201cdoctrinal paradox\u201d (Kornhauser and Sager 1986, 1993) or \u201cdiscursive\ndilemma\u201d (Pettit 2001a) and has sparked a technical literature on judg-\nment aggregation (List and Pettit [2002] and other contributions re-\nviewed above).\nDisagreements between the Premise- and Conclusion-Based Procedures\nConsider the tenure and global warming examples. Both are conjunctive\ndecision problems with premises R1 and R2 and conclusion C. The in-\ndividual judgments are as shown in table 1. All individuals have consis-\ntent judgments relative to the logical relation .C \u2194 (R & R )1 2\nUnder the conclusion-based procedure, the group takes a majority\nvote on C: here C is rejected. Under the premise-based procedure, the\ngroup takes majority votes on R1 and R2, which are both accepted, and\ndeduces its collective judgment on C from its judgments on R1 and R2,\nusing the logical relation ; here C is accepted. So theC \u2194 (R & R )1 2\npremise- and conclusion-based procedures produce different outcomes\non C. In the tenure example, the candidate would be granted tenure\nunder the premise-based procedure but not under the conclusion-based\none. In the global warming example, the expert committee would advise\n9. in a conjunctive problem;C\u2194 (R & R & . . . & R ) C\u2194 (R or R or . . . or1 2 k 1 2\nin a disjunctive one.R )k\n370 Ethics January 2006\nTABLE 1\nThe Discursive Dilemma (Conjunctive Form)\nR1 R2 C \u2194 (R1 & R2) C\nIndividual 1 True True True True\nIndividual 2 True False True False\nIndividual 3 False True True False\nMajority True True True False\nTABLE 2\nThe Discursive Dilemma (Disjunctive Form)\nR1 R2 R3 C \u2194 (R1 or R2 or R3) C\nIndividual 1 True False False True True\nIndividual 2 False True False True True\nIndividual 3 False False True True True\nMajority False False False True True\nthat there will be significant global warming if it uses the premise-based\nprocedure but not if it uses the conclusion-based one.\nNext consider the habitat example. Let C be the proposition to\nprotect the habitat, and R1, R2, and R3 the propositions that this should\nbe done, respectively, for scientific, religious, and economic reasons.\nFor simplicity, suppose that these are the only relevant reasons and that\nthere are three legislators (or equal-sized factions) with individual judg-\nments as shown in table 2. All individuals have consistent judgments\nrelative to the logical relation .C \u2194 (R or R or R )1 2 3\nUnder the conclusion-based procedure, the group takes a majority\nvote on C: here C is (unanimously) accepted. Under the premise-based\nprocedure, the group takes majority votes on R1, R2, and R3, which are\neach rejected; every proposed reason for protecting the habitat is re-\njected by a majority. The collective judgment on C is then deduced from\nthese judgments on R1, R2, and R3, using the logical relation C \u2194 (R1\n; here C is rejected. Again, the premise- and conclusion-or R or R )2 3\nbased procedures differ in the outcome on C. So the habitat protection\npolicy would be adopted under the conclusion-based procedure but not\nunder the premise-based one.\nThe Frequency of Disagreements between the Conclusion- and Premise-Based\nProcedures\nAre the disagreements between the premise- and conclusion-based pro-\ncedures contrived artifacts, or are they likely to occur in practice? To\nList Discursive Dilemma 371\ngive a partial answer to this question, let me suggest some considerations\non the frequency of such disagreements.\nA scenario of likely disagreements.\u2014In a disjunctive decision problem,\nsuppose each individual has a small but not very small probability p of\naccepting each premise.10 Specifically, p is between 0.29 and 0.5 if there\nare two premises, between 0.21 and 0.5 if there are three, and between\n0.16 and 0.5 if there are four, generally between and 0.5. Ink1\u0001 \u00010.5\nthe habitat example, each proposed reason for protecting the habitat\nmay appeal to a randomly selected individual only with a low, but not\nvery low, probability. Then, with increasing group size, the probability\nof a disagreement between the premise- and conclusion-based proce-\ndures approaches 1. This result holds because, with increasing group\nsize, the probability of a majority on the conclusion approaches 1 (as\neach individual jointly rejects all premises with a probability less than\n, that is, accepts at least one premise with a probabilityk(1\u0001 p) ! 0.5\ngreater than 0.5), while the probability of a majority against every prem-\nise also approaches 1. A similar result holds in a conjunctive decision\nproblem if each individual has a large but not very large probability p\nof accepting each premise, specifically between 0.5 and 0.71 if there are\ntwo premises, between 0.5 and 0.79 if there are three, and between 0.5\nand 0.84 if there are four, generally between 0.5 and .k\u00010.5\nA scenario of unlikely disagreements.\u2014In a disjunctive decision prob-\nlem, suppose at least one premise is more likely than not to be accepted\nby each individual. For example, one premise might stand out as ap-\npealing. Then, with increasing group size, the probability of a disagree-\nment between the premise- and conclusion-based procedures ap-\nproaches 0. This result holds because, with increasing group size, the\nprobability that at least one premise is accepted by a majority (and\ntherefore that the conclusion is accepted under both procedures) ap-\nproaches 1. A similar result holds in a conjunctive decision problem if\nat least one premise is more likely than not to be rejected by each\nindividual.\nThe counting and expectation approaches.\u2014To quantify the frequency\nof a given voting paradox, social choice theorists often ask the following\ntwo questions. First, given all possible combinations of inputs (here:\nindividual judgments) from a group of individuals, how large is the\nproportion among those combinations leading to the paradox in ques-\ntion? Call this the counting approach.11 Second, suppose we do not know\nthe probability with which each group member endorses each possible\n10. In this and the next scenario, I assume that the judgments of different individuals\nare mutually independent; also, by saying x is between y and z, I mean .y ! x ! z\n11. This approach can be shown to be equivalent to the so-called impartial culture\napproach.\n372 Ethics January 2006\ninput and we consider every possible probability distribution equally\nconceivable;12 then, what is the expected frequency of the paradox in\nquestion? Call this the expectation approach.13 Although answers to these\nquestions are well known for standard voting paradoxes (Gehrlein and\nFishburn 1976; Gehrlein 1981, 1983), they have only recently been given\nfor the discursive dilemma, specifically for a disagreement between the\npremise- and conclusion-based procedures in a two-premise conjunctive\ndecision problem; the answers for a two-premise disjunctive decision\nproblem are the same (List 2005). On the counting approach, the fre-\nquency of a disagreement between the two procedures approaches 0.25\nwith increasing group size; on the expectation approach, it approaches\n0.125. Compare this with the frequency of a Condorcet voting cycle over\nthree candidates.14 On the counting approach, that frequency ap-\nproaches 0.08774 with increasing group size; on the expectation ap-\nproach, it approaches 0.0625. Both numbers are smaller than those for\ndisagreements between the premise- and conclusion-based procedures.\nAlthough these results do not prove that such disagreements\u2014discursive\ndilemmas\u2014are empirically likely, they underline that they should be\ntaken as seriously as standard voting paradoxes.\nIV. THE PUBLIC AGENDA\nThe Concept of the Public Agenda\nFor any given collective decision problem, let the public agenda be the\nset of propositions to be collectively decided. The public agenda might\nbe interpreted as the \u201csphere of public reason\u201d for that decision\nproblem.\nThe minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts can\nbe seen as alternative views on how large or small the public agenda\nshould be. The minimal liberal account recommends a small public\nagenda: it should include only those propositions on which a decision\nis needed for practical action. In the habitat protection example, it\nmight include only the proposition to protect the habitat but no sup-\nporting reasons or background considerations. The comprehensive de-\nliberative account recommends a larger public agenda: it should include\nnot only practical propositions but also relevant supporting reasons and\n12. Note that this is a second-order uncertainty. We do not know the judgments that\nwill be made (a first-order uncertainty), and we do not know the probability distribution\nover all possible combinations of judgments (a second-order uncertainty). We apply an\nepistemological indifference principle at this second-order level and assume each possible\nprobability distribution to be equally likely to be correct.\n13. This approach can be shown to be equivalent to the so-called impartial anonymous\nculture approach.\n14. This comparison is arguably appropriate, as a two-premise conjunctive discursive\ndilemma is structurally similar to a three-candidate Condorcet paradox (List 2005).\nList Discursive Dilemma 373\nbackground considerations. In the habitat case, it might include not\nonly the proposition to protect the habitat but also other consider-\nations\u2014perhaps economic, political, scientific, or cultural ones\u2014rele-\nvant to that main practical issue.\nThe minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts rep-\nresent extreme positions on how to specify the public agenda. On an\nintermediate account, some reasons and background considerations\nmight be deemed publicly admissible, others not; accordingly, the public\nagenda might include the former but not the latter. Rawls\u2019s \u201cpolitical\nliberalism\u201d (1993), for example, recommends the inclusion of certain\nreasons and background considerations in the public agenda and the\nexclusion of others. Those to be included are \u201cpolitical\u201d ones that may\nbe supported by an overlapping consensus in society; those to be ex-\ncluded are \u201cmetaphysical\u201d ones, on which there may be irresolvable\ndisagreement and which do not require public resolution.15\nThe Public Agenda in a Conjunctive or Disjunctive Decision Problem\nConsider a conjunctive or disjunctive decision problem. Suppose the\nconclusion C is the only practical issue, while the premises\nare supporting reasons or theoretical considerations.R , R , . . . , R1 2 k\nThen the minimal liberal account would include in the public agenda\nonly proposition C, while the comprehensive deliberative account would\nalso include propositions R1, R2, . . . , Rk and a proposition on the\nlogical relation between the premises and the conclusion, such as\nor \u2014or moreC \u2194 (R & R & . . . & R ) C \u2194 (R or R or . . . or R )1 2 k 1 2 k\nthan one such proposition if the logical relation itself is under debate.\nFurther, I assume that, when a proposition is included in the public\nagenda, so is its negation; thus the group can accept either the prop-\nosition or its negation or neither.\nThe Complexity of the Public Agenda\nLet me call the public agenda simple if it includes only a single \u201catomic\u201d\nproposition such as C (or multiple unconnected ones)16 and nonsimple\nif it includes two or more \u201catomic\u201d propositions such as R1, R2, and C\nand at least one \u201ccompound\u201d proposition such as orR & R C \u21941 2\nfor representing logical relations between other proposi-(R & R )1 2\n15. An important aspect of Rawls\u2019s \u201cpolitical liberalism\u201d not captured by my analysis\nis Rawls\u2019s distinction between decisions concerning the basic structure of society and other\ndecisions.\n16. And its (their) negation(s).\n374 Ethics January 2006\ntions.17 The minimal liberal account usually recommends a simple public\nagenda, the comprehensive deliberative account a nonsimple one. It is\nimportant to emphasize that, generally, the members of a group may\ndisagree not only on premises or conclusions but also on logical rela-\ntions.\nV. JUDGMENT AGGREGATION: A FORMAL MODEL\nThe Discursive Dilemma Generalized\nSuppose the public agenda has been specified, that is, the propositions\nto be decided are given. Then the group needs to find a procedure for\nmaking those decisions. Let a decision procedure be a method of gener-\nating collective judgments on the propositions in the public agenda\nbased on the group members\u2019 individual judgments on these proposi-\ntions.18 Although I have already introduced two such procedures, that\nis, the premise- and conclusion-based ones, let me take a step back and\nask what demands one might impose on a decision procedure. At least\nthree demands seem plausible.\nFirst, the decision procedure should function under conditions of\npluralism. Second, the collective judgments generated by the procedure\nshould be responsive to the group members\u2019 individual judgments.\nThird, the collective judgments should display at least some degree of\nintegrity. Unlike the first two demands, the third demand might initially\nappeal only to proponents of the comprehensive deliberative account.\nBut the integrity demand as stated here is consistent with the minimal\nliberal account, as it has no force when the public agenda is simple: if\n17. Crucially, logical interconnections between propositions are not taken to be ex-\nogenously given. Rather, collective judgments can be made on both \u201catomic\u201d and \u201ccom-\npound\u201d propositions. Technically, an agenda is nonsimple if it is of one of the following\nforms (or a superset thereof): (i) it includes premises R1, . . . , Rk and either theirk 1 1\nconjunction R1 & . . . & Rk, or their disjunction R1 or R2 or . . . or Rk, or both (and the\nnegations of all these propositions); (ii) it includes premises R1, . . . , Rk, a conclusionk 1 1\nC and either the proposition or the propositionC\u2194 (R & . . . & R ) C\u2194 (R or R1 k 1 2\nor both (and negations); (iii) it includes a premise R, a conclusion C, andor . . . or R )k\nthe proposition (and negations). The property nonsimple is slightly more de-R r C\nmanding than that of being not simple. For generalizations of the property nonsimple\nunder which proposition 2 below continues to hold, see Dietrich (2005b) and Dietrich\nand List (2005).\n18. A decision procedure is a function whose input is a vector of individual judgment\nsets and whose output is a collective judgment set (List and Pettit 2002). An individual\nor collective judgment set is a subset of the public agenda interpreted as the set of prop-\nositions accepted (as true) by the individual or collective. Individual judgment sets are\nusually assumed to be complete (a member of each proposition-negation pair is accepted)\nand consistent (in the standard sense of logic), but these assumptions can be relaxed. In\nthe collective case, completeness (decisiveness) and consistency (integrity) are introduced\nas demands on decision procedures.\nList Discursive Dilemma 375\nthe group considers only a single proposition or several unconnected\nones, then integrity is vacuously satisfied, no matter how the group\ndecides. Consider the following as a first formalization of the three\ndemands.\nPluralism.\u2014The decision procedure accepts as admissible inputs all\npossible combinations of individual judgments on the propositions in\nthe public agenda.\nMajoritarian responsiveness.\u2014The collective judgment on each prop-\nosition in the public agenda is the judgment of the majority of individ-\nuals on that proposition.\nIntegrity.\u2014The collective judgments generated by the decision pro-\ncedure are consistent, that is, the propositions collectively accepted can\nbe simultaneously true.\nWhile the formalizations of the pluralism and integrity demands\nare fairly straightforward, majoritarian responsiveness captures only one\nform of responsiveness and is generalized and relaxed below. My reason\nfor considering it as an initial formalization of responsiveness is that it\nis the form of responsiveness invoked in discussions of the discursive\ndilemma. Are there any decision procedures that simultaneously meet\nthe three demands in the present form? If the public agenda is non-\nsimple, as in standard conjunctive or disjunctive decision problems, the\nanswer is negative.\nProposition 1: For a nonsimple public agenda, there exists no\ndecision procedure that meets the demands of pluralism, major-\nitarian responsiveness, and integrity.19\nTo sketch a proof, assume, for a contradiction, that there exists a\ndecision procedure satisfying pluralism, majoritarian responsiveness,\nand integrity. For any group of three or more individuals, combinations\nof individual judgments similar to those in tables 1 and 2 can be con-\nstructed; an explicit construction is given in the appendix. By the de-\nmand of pluralism, those combinations are admissible inputs to the\ndecision procedure. By the demand of majoritarian responsiveness, the\ncollective judgment on each proposition is the majority judgment on\nthat proposition. But, for the given combinations of individual judg-\nments, those majority judgments are not consistent: the accepted prop-\nositions\u2014for example, R1, R2, , and not-C in table 1\u2014C \u2194 (R & R )1 2\ncannot be simultaneously true. This contradicts the integrity demand.\n19. Assuming three or more individuals. For exactly four individuals, note the remark\nafter table A3. A variant of the proposition holds whenever the largest minimal inconsistent\nsubset of the public agenda has three or more elements.\n376 Ethics January 2006\nA More General Impossibility Result\nI now keep the formalizations of the pluralism and integrity demands\nbut generalize that of the responsiveness demand. To give an alternative\nformalization of responsiveness without the majoritarian requirement,\ndefine a single-proposition decision rule to be a method of summarizing\nthe individual judgments on a single proposition into a collective judg-\nment on that proposition. Examples are not only simple majority voting\nbut also qualified majority voting, submajority voting, the unanimity\nrule, a dictatorship of one individual, or even quirkier rules that decide\na proposition based on whether it is supported by an even or odd\nnumber of individuals.\nSystematic responsiveness.\u2014There exists a single-proposition decision\nrule such that the collective judgment on each proposition in the public\nagenda is the result of applying that decision rule to the individual\njudgments on that proposition.\nAlthough weaker than majoritarian responsiveness, systematic re-\nsponsiveness is still a strong requirement, as it demands independent\nand equal treatment of all propositions. Below I consider cases where\nwe may have good reasons to abandon the requirement of independent\nand equal treatment across propositions and thus to relax systematic\nresponsiveness. In addition to replacing majoritarian responsiveness\nwith systematic responsiveness here, let me also make explicit two de-\nmands implicit in majoritarian responsiveness: first, the decision pro-\ncedure should give all individuals equal weight, and second, the pro-\ncedure should not leave any propositions in the public agenda\nundecided (after all, those propositions are precisely the ones to be\ndecided):20\nAnonymity.\u2014The decision procedure is invariant under permuta-\ntions of the individuals.\nDecisiveness.\u2014The decision procedure generates a determinate col-\nlective judgment on every proposition in the public agenda (acceptance\nof either the proposition or its negation).\nAgain, for a nonsimple public agenda, there exists no decision\nprocedure that meets all demands simultaneously, as proved by List and\nPettit (2002).\nProposition 2: For a nonsimple public agenda, there exists no\ndecision procedure that meets the demands of pluralism, system-\natic responsiveness, anonymity, decisiveness, and integrity.21\n20. These demands are implicit in majoritarian responsiveness. All individuals have\nequal weight in majority decisions, and majority decisions (almost) always lead to a de-\nterminate judgment (except for majority ties).\n21. Again, assuming three or more individuals.\nList Discursive Dilemma 377\nThis impossibility result is analogous, but not equivalent, to Arrow\u2019s\nimpossibility theorem (1951) (for a comparison, see List and Pettit 2004;\nDietrich and List 2005). If the public agenda is not only nonsimple but\nincludes more complex logical interconnections (which can be tech-\nnically described), then an impossibility result still occurs if systematic\nresponsiveness is weakened to independence,22 but respect for unanimity23\nis demanded (Pauly and van Hees 2005; Dietrich 2005a; Dietrich and\nList 2005; for further results, see the references in n. 1 above).\nEscape Routes\nPropositions 1 and 2 show that some plausible demands on a decision\nprocedure are mutually incompatible when the public agenda is non-\nsimple. As the comprehensive deliberative account typically recom-\nmends a nonsimple public agenda, the results pose a challenge for that\naccount. If the account requires all the identified demands, then it faces\nan impossibility problem, as the demands cannot be simultaneously met.\nFor the minimal liberal account, the problem is less serious, as that\naccount requires only a simple public agenda. How can the impossibility\nproblem be avoided? Logically, there are several escape routes (List and\nPettit 2002), but only some are appealing from minimal liberal or com-\nprehensive deliberative perspectives.\nShrinking the public agenda.\u2014If the public agenda is simple\u2014con-\ntaining only a single proposition or multiple unconnected ones\u2014then\nthe group can take majority votes on those (few) propositions in the\npublic agenda and will meet all the demands introduced above. This\ndecision procedure is precisely the conclusion-based procedure in case\nthe premises in a conjunctive or disjunctive decision problem are ex-\ncluded from the public agenda, as recommended by the minimal liberal\naccount. So the present way to avoid the impossibility problem is the\npreferred one from a minimal liberal perspective.\nReducing pluralism, especially through deliberation.\u2014If not all possible\ncombinations of individual judgments are admissible as inputs to the\ndecision procedure, but only ones with sufficient agreement among\nindividuals, then the group can take majority votes on all propositions\nin the public agenda\u2014even a nonsimple one\u2014and will meet all the\ndemands imposed above, except that of pluralism. For a certain type\nof structural agreement among individuals, called unidimensional align-\n22. Independence is the demand that, for each proposition in the public agenda,\nthere exists a single-proposition decision rule such that the collective judgment on that\nproposition is the result of applying that decision rule to the individual judgments on\nthat proposition. (Unlike systematic responsiveness, independence allows the single-\nproposition decision rule to vary from proposition to proposition.)\n23. Defined below in Sec. VII under \u201cAn Impossibility Result.\u201d\n378 Ethics January 2006\nment, majoritarian responsiveness and integrity are compatible (List\n2003). This escape route is of interest from a comprehensive deliberative\nperspective. Proponents of that account will typically advocate not only\npublic decision making on reasons but also public deliberation in a\ndecision process. Such deliberation might transform individual judg-\nments and generate the required structural agreement among group\nmembers (Miller 1992). There is some evidence for a mechanism along\nthese lines in a preference (as opposed to judgment) aggregation con-\ntext, but, depending on the original level of disagreement in a group,\nsuch a mechanism will not always be operational (List, Fishkin, Luskin,\nand McLean 2000).\nRelaxing the responsiveness demand.\u2014Instead of requiring that the\ncollective judgment on every proposition in the public agenda should\nbe the majority judgment on that proposition (or the result of applying\nthe same single-proposition decision rule), one might require that col-\nlective judgments should be responsive to individual ones in this way\nonly for some but not all propositions and that collective judgments on\nothers should be derived indirectly. The premise-based procedure is an\ninstance of this. Here the collective judgments on the premises are the\nmajority judgments on these premises, but the collective judgment on\nthe conclusion is derived from these judgments using the appropriate\nlogical relation. This approach makes explicit an order of priority among\nthe propositions: some serve as reasons or premises for others and are\ngiven priority in a (collective) reasoning process. This idea is generalized\nin Section VIII below. Proponents of the comprehensive deliberative\naccount might argue that the \u201ccollectivization of reason\u201d is captured\nmore adequately by this approach than by pure proposition-by-propo-\nsition aggregation (Pettit 2001a; Chapman 2002). On this view, relaxing\nmajoritarian or systematic responsiveness is seen not as a sacrifice but\nas a gain.\nAppointing a dictator.\u2014The demands of pluralism, systematic\n(though not majoritarian) responsiveness, decisiveness, and integrity are\nmet for a nonsimple public agenda if and only if one individual is\nappointed as a dictator who determines the group\u2019s judgments (Pauly\nand van Hees 2005; Dietrich and List 2005). This decision procedure\nis unappealing from both minimal liberal and comprehensive deliber-\native perspectives. It not only violates anonymity, a fundamental liberal\nprinciple, but also abandons the idea that collective judgments should\nbe the result of some nondictatorial collective process.\nRelaxing the decisiveness demand.\u2014Instead of making a determinate\ncollective judgment on every proposition in the public agenda, the\ngroup might abstain from making judgments on certain (controver-\nsial) propositions, such as when there is not enough agreement for\nor against a proposition. Specifically, the group might apply a super-\nList Discursive Dilemma 379\nmajority or unanimity rule whereby (i) a proposition is collectively\naccepted if it is accepted by a large supermajority (or all) of the in-\ndividuals; (ii) its negation is collectively accepted if that negation is\naccepted by a similarly large supermajority; (iii) otherwise the prop-\nosition is left undecided. If the required supermajority is sufficiently\nlarge, this decision procedure will meet all the demands introduced\nabove, except that of decisiveness, as many propositions will be left\nundecided (List 2004; Goodin and List 2006). Compare this approach\nwith that of shrinking the public agenda. On the present approach,\nthe public agenda may remain large (particularly: nonsimple), but the\ngroup is not required to settle all issues in that agenda. On the ap-\nproach of shrinking the public agenda, the group is required to settle\nall issues in the public agenda, but, to make this feasible, the agenda\nis made small. The present approach is of interest from both minimal\nliberal and comprehensive deliberative perspectives. Proponents of\nthe minimal liberal account may be attracted to the idea that collec-\ntive judgments are made only if they are either practically necessary\nor reducible to the unanimity (or near-unanimity) judgments of indi-\nviduals. Compare Buchanan and Tullock\u2019s unanimitarian approach\n(1962) to decision making on constitutional matters. Proponents of\nthe comprehensive deliberative account may be attracted to the idea\nthat the public agenda can remain large, and perhaps include reasons,\neven if not all propositions in that agenda are collectively decided.\nRelaxing the integrity demand.\u2014Finally, a way to avoid the identified\nimpossibility problem is to relax the integrity demand and to allow\ninconsistent collective judgments. But this route seems unattractive. Pro-\nponents of the comprehensive deliberative account will be unwilling to\nrelax the integrity demand, as it lies at the heart of their account. Pro-\nponents of the minimal liberal account may be prepared to relax it but\ndo not need to, as their account largely excludes higher-order reasons\nand logical relations from the public agenda, so that integrity is an\n(almost) vacuous requirement.\nIt is now clear how the premise- and conclusion-based procedures\nfit into the logical space mapped out by the demands on decision pro-\ncedures introduced above. Each procedure represents one escape route\nfrom the identified impossibility problem. The conclusion-based pro-\ncedure represents the route of shrinking the public agenda and per-\nmitting an \u201cincompletely theorized\u201d decision on the conclusion. The\npremise-based procedure represents that of relaxing responsiveness so\nas to allow the prioritization of some propositions over others and permit\nthe \u201ccollectivization of reason.\u201d As these two routes are the preferred\nones from minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative perspectives,\nrespectively, the present observations reinforce my earlier claim that the\nminimal liberal account suggests a conclusion-based approach to col-\n380 Ethics January 2006\nlective decision making, while the comprehensive deliberative account\nsuggests a premise-based one. But, as I argue below, even on the com-\nprehensive deliberative account, a conclusion-based approach is some-\ntimes preferable on epistemological grounds.\nVI. THE TRUTH-TRACKING PROPERTIES OF THE PREMISE- AND\nCONCLUSION-BASED PROCEDURES\nHow good are the premise- and conclusion-based procedures at tracking\nthe truth in decisions involving matters of fact?\nTruth Tracking and Reliability\nConsider a proposition, P, which is factually true or false, such as the\nproposition that a patient has some disease. Inspired by Nozick (1981),\nlet me say that an agent (or decision procedure) tracks the truth on P if\ntwo conditions hold:24 First, whenever P is true, the agent (procedure)\njudges P to be true. Second, whenever P is false, it judges P to be false.\nMost agents (and decision procedures) are fallible and meet these\ntwo conditions at most approximately. To quantify an agent\u2019s (or pro-\ncedure\u2019s) reliability at truth tracking, consider two conditional proba-\nbilities, corresponding to the two conditions above: first, the conditional\nprobability that the agent (procedure) judges P to be true, given that\nP is true; second, the conditional probability that it judges P to be false,\ngiven that P is false. I call these two conditional probabilities the agent\u2019s\n(procedure\u2019s) positive and negative reliability on P. Sometimes the two\nprobabilities are the same (symmetrical reliability), sometimes they come\napart: an agent (procedure) may be better at detecting the truth of P\nthan its falsehood or vice versa (asymmetrical reliability). Many medical\ndiagnostic tests are asymmetrical in this sense: they are better at de-\ntecting the presence of some disease if the patient has the disease than\nits absence if the patient does not.\nAn agent (or decision procedure) with a high positive and negative\nreliability on P is obviously a good truth tracker on P, and one with a\nlow positive and negative reliability a bad one. But even an agent (pro-\ncedure) with a high positive and low negative, or low positive and high\nnegative, reliability can be a bad truth tracker. Imagine a diagnostic test\nthat always produces a negative verdict, regardless of whether or not\n24. To obtain Nozick\u2019s analysis, the present two conditionals must be read as coun-\nterfactual conditionals and not just as material conditionals. My simple operationalization\nof truth tracking in terms of conditional probabilities is arguably weaker than Nozick\u2019s\ncounterfactual analysis.\nList Discursive Dilemma 381\nthe patient has the disease. This test has a negative reliability of 1 but\na positive reliability of 0. As a truth tracker, it is useless.25\nMajority Voting and Truth Tracking on a Single Proposition\nSuppose a group of individuals\u2014a jury, for example\u2014has to make a\ncollective judgment on some factual proposition, based on the group\nmembers\u2019 individual judgments on that proposition. What decision pro-\ncedure should the group use? The Condorcet jury theorem shows that,\nunder mild assumptions about individual reliability, majority voting is\na remarkably good truth tracker (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983).\nCondorcet jury theorem: Suppose each group member has\na (positive and negative) reliability p greater than 0.5 on some\nproposition and different individuals\u2019 judgments are mutually in-\ndependent. Then the (positive and negative) reliability of the\ngroup\u2019s majority judgment on that proposition approaches 1 as\nthe group size increases.\nSo if each group member has a chance greater than 0.5 of making\na correct judgment on some proposition (both when it is true and when\nit is false)\u2014call this Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption\u2014then the group\ncan make a fairly reliable judgment on that proposition just by taking\na simple majority vote, provided the number of individuals is sufficiently\nlarge and their judgments are mutually independent.\nSometimes a group is particularly concerned with avoiding false\npositive decisions (the acceptance of a false proposition) or avoiding\nfalse negative ones (the rejection of a true proposition). In such cases,\nsuper- or submajority voting instead of simple majority voting is optimal.\nFor example, supermajority voting is often used in criminal trials, to\navoid convicting the innocent. Submajority voting is sometimes used in\nlegislative or judicial decisions on whether to consider an initiative or\ncomplaint, to avoid overlooking valid initiatives or complaints. But with-\nout an asymmetry between false positives and false negatives, the Con-\n25. This example also shows that it is not always helpful to summarize the positive\nand negative reliability levels into one figure, by considering the unconditional probability\nthat the agent\u2019s judgment matches the truth value of some proposition P. This uncon-\nditional probability is the sum of (i) the unconditional probability that P is true multiplied\nby the conditional probability that the agent judges P to be true, given that P is true and\n(ii) the unconditional probability that P is false multiplied by the conditional probability\nthat the agent judges P to be false, given that P is false. Bovens and Rabinowicz (2005)\nuse such a summary figure to measure reliability. To see that this does not always provide\na good measure of reliability, note that, even for the indiscriminate diagnostic test of the\nexample, the summary figure can be arbitrarily close to 1, namely, when the disease in\nquestion is very unlikely. But the fact that (say) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is an extremely\nunlikely disease does not make a test that always says \u201cnegative\u201d a good truth tracker.\n382 Ethics January 2006\ndorcet jury theorem supports the use of simple majority voting in de-\ncisions where Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption is met.\nThe Case of Multiple Propositions\nSuppose now a group has to decide multiple propositions, such as prem-\nises and conclusions in a conjunctive or disjunctive decision problem,\nand suppose further the propositions are factual ones. Doesn\u2019t the Con-\ndorcet jury theorem simply suggest that the group should take majority\nvotes on all those propositions?\nIf all group members meet Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption\non every proposition, this is true. But, even on an optimistic view, in-\ndividuals will not generally meet this assumption on multiple intercon-\nnected propositions. To see why not, suppose an individual has a (pos-\nitive and negative) reliability of 0.65 on each of propositions R1 and R2\n(two factual premises, say) and her judgments on R1 and R2 are mutually\nindependent. The probability of 0.65 is well above the threshold of 0.5\nin Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption. But now consider the same\nindividual\u2019s reliability on a conclusion C that is true just in case the\nconjunction is true. If R1 and R2 are both true, the individualR & R1 2\nwill have a probability of 0.652p 0.4225 of judging (and henceR & R1 2\nC) to be true. So the individual\u2019s positive reliability on C is below the\nthreshold of 0.5. Although the individual\u2019s negative reliability on C is\nstill above that threshold, the individual does not meet Condorcet\u2019s\ncompetence assumption for the conclusion C, even though she meets\nthat assumption for each of the two premises R1 and R2. If all group\nmembers are like this, then majority voting on the conclusion C is a\nbad truth tracker\u2014specifically, its positive reliability on C will approach\n0 as the group size increases.\nIn general, individuals have different levels of reliability on different\npropositions. Some propositions are harder to judge than others. For\nexample, it is harder to detect the truth of a conjunction than that of\neach conjunct, but easier to detect its falsehood; it is easier to detect\nthe truth of a disjunction than that of each disjunct, but harder to detect\nits falsehood. Depending on the logical and epistemological nature of\na decision problem involving multiple propositions, individuals may\nhave different levels of reliability across these propositions. This needs\nto be taken into account when a procedure is chosen for making col-\nlective judgments on those propositions.\nExtending recent work by Bovens and Rabinowicz (2005), I suggest\nthat the premise-based procedure is a superior truth tracker for some\ndecision problems and the conclusion-based procedure for others (see\nalso List 2005). The conditions under which the premise-based procedure\noutperforms the conclusion-based one are similar to those assumed by\nList Discursive Dilemma 383\nBovens and Rabinowicz (although they suggest, debatably,26 that even\nunder these conditions the conclusion-based procedure is sometimes bet-\nter). The conditions under which the conclusion-based procedure out-\nperforms the premise-based one are explored here for the first time. In\nmy discussion, I keep the standard assumption of the Condorcet jury\ntheorem that the judgments of different individuals are mutually inde-\npendent (for discussions of dependencies between different individuals\u2019\njudgments, see Ladha [1992], Estlund [1994], Dietrich and List [2004a]).\nConditions under Which the Premise-Based Procedure Outperforms the\nConclusion-Based Procedure\nConsider a conjunctive or disjunctive decision problem with k premises\nR1, . . . , Rk and a conclusion C.\nThe structure of individual reliability.\u2014Each individual has a (positive\nand negative) reliability p above 0.5 and below on each premise,k\u00010.5\nand her judgments on different premises are mutually independent. So\neach individual meets Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption on each\npremise but is still fallible.\nAn example.\u2014In the tenure example, the committee members\u2019 judg-\nments on the two tenure requirements might satisfy these assumptions\nif we assume, first, that each committee member is reasonably, but not\nvery, good at judging the candidate\u2019s teaching performance and at judg-\ning her research performance and, second (more idealistically), that\neach member judges the first tenure requirement independently from\nthe second.\nThe implication for a conjunctive decision problem.\u2014Under the premise-\nbased procedure, the group\u2019s (positive and negative) reliability on the\nconclusion approaches 1 with increasing group size. In the tenure ex-\nample, a large committee is likely to grant the candidate tenure if and\nonly if she meets the requirements. By contrast, under the conclusion-\nbased procedure, the group\u2019s negative reliability approaches 1, but its\npositive reliability approaches 0. Here the conclusion is likely to be\nrejected in a large group, even when it is true. In the example, the\ncandidate is likely to be denied tenure, no matter how excellent she is.\nThe conclusion-based procedure is similar to a diagnostic test that (al-\nmost) always gives the same verdict (here the rejection of the conclu-\nsion).\nThe implication for a disjunctive decision problem.\u2014Under the premise-\nbased procedure, the group\u2019s (positive and negative) reliability on the con-\nclusion approaches 1 with increasing group size. Under the conclusion-\n26. See n. 25 above. But I agree that the conclusion-based procedure is sometimes\npreferable when there are certain asymmetries between false positives and false negatives,\nas discussed below.\n384 Ethics January 2006\nbased procedure, its positive reliability approaches 1, but its negative\nreliability approaches 0. Here the conclusion is likely to be accepted in\na large group, even when it is false. For a sketch proof, see the appendix.\nConditions under Which the Conclusion-Based Procedure Outperforms the\nPremise-Based Procedure\nFirst consider a disjunctive decision problem with k premises R1, . . . ,\nRk and a conclusion C.\nThe structure of individual reliability.\u2014Suppose each premise is\nthought by the individuals to have a low prior probability of being true.\nIf all premises are false, then each individual has a probability p greater\nthan 0.5 of judging that they are all false. If (at least) one premise is\ntrue, then each individual has a probability p greater than 0.5 of judging\none to be true, but it is still difficult for the individual to determine\nwhich one it is. The individual\u2019s probability p of judging one premise\nto be true is distributed across the k premises: she has a probability p1\nof judging R1 true, a probability p2 of judging R2 true, and so on, where\nexceeds 0.5, but each of is less thanpp p \u0002 . . . \u0002 p p , . . . , p1 k 1 k\n0.5. (One might also assume that, if Ri is the premise that is actually\ntrue, then pi exceeds pj for any j other than i, but this assumption is not\nessential.)\nAn example.\u2014Again, an expert committee has to give advice on\nwhether there will be significant global warming. Call this proposition\nC. Here C is true if and only if at least one of several possible causes\nfor global warming, , is in operation. The following scenarioR , . . . , R1 k\nis conceivable. If there is no global warming\u2014none of the causes is in\noperation\u2014then each scientist has a chance above 0.5 of ruling out\nglobal warming and all of its causes. But if there is global warming\u2014at\nleast one cause is in operation\u2014then each scientist has a chance above\n0.5 of judging this to be the case, but only a chance below 0.5 of iden-\ntifying the correct cause. (Perhaps each scientist is still more likely to\npick the correct cause than any incorrect one, but none of these prob-\nabilities exceeds 0.5.)\nThe implication.\u2014Under the conclusion-based procedure, the group\u2019s\n(positive and negative) reliability on the conclusion approaches 1 with\nincreasing group size. In the new global warming example, a large com-\nmittee is likely to track the truth on the presence or absence of global\nwarming. Under the premise-based procedure, the group\u2019s negative re-\nliability approaches 1, but its positive reliability approaches 0. Here the\nconclusion is likely to be rejected in a large group, even when it is true.\nIn the example, even when there is global warming, none of the causes\nis likely to be accepted by a majority of scientists, and hence the committee\nis likely to advise that there will not be significant global warming. For a\nsketch proof, see the appendix.\nList Discursive Dilemma 385\nNext consider a conjunctive decision problem with k premises\nand a conclusion C.R , . . . , R1 k\nThe structure of individual reliability.\u2014Suppose each premise is\nthought by the individuals to have a high prior probability of being\ntrue. If all premises are true, then each individual has a probability p\ngreater than 0.5 of judging that they are all true. If (at least) one premise\nis false, then each individual has a probability p greater than 0.5 of\njudging one to be false, but again it is difficult for the individual to\ndetermine which one it is. The individual has a probability p1 of judging\nR1 false, a probability p2 of judging R2 false, and so on, where pp\nexceeds 0.5, but each of is less than 0.5.p \u0002 . . . \u0002 p p , . . . , p1 k 1 k\n(One might assume that, if Ri is the premise that is actually false, then\npi exceeds pj for any j other than i, but again this assumption is not\nessential.)\nAn example.\u2014An expert committee (e.g., the board of a space\nagency) has to give advice on whether a complex technological system\n(e.g., a space shuttle) is free from a significant safety risk. This prop-\nosition, C, is true if and only if the system\u2019s multiple components all\nfunction correctly. Here the following scenario is conceivable. If the\nsystem is free from any significant risk\u2014all components function cor-\nrectly\u2014then each expert may have a chance above 0.5 of judging this\nto be the case. But if there is a significant risk\u2014at least one component\nis faulty\u2014then each expert may have a chance above 0.5 of judging that\nthere is a risk, but only a chance below 0.5 of correctly identifying the\nfaulty component. (Perhaps each expert is more likely to identify the\nfaulty component than any other component, but none of these prob-\nabilities exceeds 0.5.)\nThe implication.\u2014Under the conclusion-based procedure, the group\u2019s\n(positive and negative) reliability on the conclusion approaches 1 with\nincreasing group size. In the risk assessment example, a large committee\nis likely to track the truth on whether or not the system is free from a\nsignificant risk. Under the premise-based procedure, the group\u2019s negative\nreliability approaches 0, but its positive reliability approaches 1. Here the\nconclusion is likely to be accepted in a large group, even when it is false.\nIn the example, even when there is a significant risk, none of the system\u2019s\ncomponents is likely to be identified as faulty by a majority of committee\nmembers, and hence the committee is likely to advise that there is no\nsignificant risk. For a sketch proof, see the appendix.\nComparing the Conditions\nI have argued that, when individuals make judgments on multiple prop-\nositions, such as premises and conclusions, it is plausible that they satisfy\nCondorcet\u2019s competence assumption\u2014a greater than 0.5 chance of\nmaking a correct judgment\u2014on some propositions but not on others.\n386 Ethics January 2006\nSometimes the truth of the premises is directly discernible, while\ndiscerning the truth of the conclusion\u2014for example, a complex con-\njunction\u2014requires complicated inferences. In these cases, individuals\nare more likely to satisfy Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption on the\npremises than on the conclusion. Other times the truth of the conclu-\nsion is easier to discern than that of the premises; the conclusion might\nbe a broad, \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d proposition, while the premises might be\n\u201cfine-grained\u201d propositions about complex causal mechanisms. In those\ncases, individuals are more likely to satisfy Condorcet\u2019s competence as-\nsumption on the conclusion than on the premises.\nThe key to choosing a decision procedure that tracks the truth on\nmultiple propositions lies in identifying those propositions on which\nCondorcet\u2019s competence assumption is met by the relevant individuals.\nIf the assumption is met on the premises but not on the conclusion,\nthen the premise-based procedure outperforms the conclusion-based\none at truth tracking. If it is met on the conclusion but not on the\npremises, then the conclusion-based procedure outperforms the prem-\nise-based one. Even when the public agenda is defined broadly, as rec-\nommended by the comprehensive deliberative account, the premise-\nbased procedure is sometimes a worse truth tracker than the\nconclusion-based one. Therefore even the proponents of the compre-\nhensive deliberative account may sometimes opt for a conclusion-based\napproach if they are concerned with truth tracking.\nFalse Positives versus False Negatives\nAs noted, in some decision problems there is an asymmetry between\nfalse positives and false negatives. In the tenure example, on an em-\nployee-friendly policy, it is worse not to grant tenure to a deserving\ncandidate than to grant tenure to an undeserving one; on an employer-\nfriendly policy, the asymmetry is reversed. In the global warming ex-\nample, it is worse from a precautionary perspective not to take action\n(e.g., reduce greenhouse gas emissions) when global warming is a se-\nrious threat than to take action when the threat is less serious than\nfeared. In the habitat example, it is worse from a conservationist per-\nspective not to protect a significant habitat than to protect a less sig-\nnificant one.\nIn a conjunctive decision problem, the conditions under which the\nconclusion-based procedure accepts the conclusion are more demand-\ning than those under which the premise-based procedure does. The\nconclusion-based procedure accepts the conclusion only when a majority\nof individuals jointly accepts all premises, while the premise-based pro-\ncedure accepts it already when separate (and possibly nonoverlapping)\nmajorities accept each premise without necessarily accepting the con-\nclusion. So the conclusion-based procedure produces fewer false posi-\nList Discursive Dilemma 387\ntives than the premise-based one, but at the expense of producing more\nfalse negatives.\nIn a disjunctive decision problem, the reverse is true. The condi-\ntions under which the premise-based procedure accepts the conclusion\nare more demanding than those under which the conclusion-based pro-\ncedure does. The premise-based procedure accepts the conclusion only\nwhen at least one premise is accepted by a majority of individuals, while\nthe conclusion-based procedure accepts it already when a majority of\nindividuals accepts the conclusion based on different premises (which\nmay each be accepted only by a minority). Here the premise-based\nprocedure produces fewer false positives than the conclusion-based pro-\ncedure, but at the expense of producing more false negatives.\nThis suggests that, when the underlying structure of a decision\nproblem is conjunctive, a minimal liberal approach is less likely to pro-\nduce false positive decisions, but more likely to produce false negative\nones, than a comprehensive deliberative approach; the reverse is true\nwhen the underlying structure of a problem is disjunctive.\nBased on the asymmetries in the examples above, one might there-\nfore recommend a minimal liberal approach in the habitat case and a\ncomprehensive deliberative one in the global warming case. In the ten-\nure case, a minimal liberal approach is preferable from the perspective\nof a university concerned with protecting its reputation, whereas a com-\nprehensive deliberative one is preferable from the perspective of a junior\nfaculty member applying for tenure.\nVII. THE STRATEGIC INCENTIVES GENERATED BY THE\nPREMISE- AND CONCLUSION-BASED PROCEDURES\nMechanical versus Behavioral Differences of Decision Procedures\nDifferent decision procedures are often not only mechanically different,\nin that they generate different collective outputs (decisions) for the\nsame individual inputs (votes or judgments); they are often also behav-\niorally different, in that they lead decision makers to adjust their behavior\ndifferently and thereby affect the inputs decision makers feed into these\nprocedures in the first place. This point has been documented exten-\nsively in comparisons of different electoral systems (e.g., Norris 2004),\nand there is every reason to think that it may also be relevant to the\nissues discussed here.\nIn my comparison of the decision procedures suggested by the\nminimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts, I have so far\nfocused on their mechanical differences, holding all behavioral as-\nsumptions fixed. Specifically, I have assumed that individuals reveal the\nsame individual judgments independently of whether the setting is a\nminimal liberal or comprehensive deliberative one\u2014technically, inde-\n388 Ethics January 2006\nTABLE 3\nTable 1 (Restated)\nR1: The\ncandidate is\nexcellent in\nteaching.\nR2: The\ncandidate is\nexcellent in\nresearch. C \u2194 (R1 & R2)\nC: The\ncandidate\ndeserves\ntenure.\nIndividual 1 True True True True\nIndividual 2 True False True False\nIndividual 3 False True True False\nMajority True True True False\npendently of whether the decision procedure is a premise-based or con-\nclusion-based one. On the basis of technical work by Dietrich and List\n(2004b), I now question these behavioral assumptions and discuss be-\nhavioral differences between the two approaches.\nAn Example\nLet me revisit the tenure-committee example above, with individual\njudgments as shown in table 3 (a restatement of table 1 above). When\nI argued that the premise-based procedure leads to a positive tenure\ndecision, while the conclusion-based procedure leads to a negative one,\nI assumed that, under both procedures, the individuals reveal exactly\nthe judgments shown in table 1; call these the individuals\u2019 truthful judg-\nments. Is this assumption plausible?\nSuppose that each committee member is convinced of his or her\nown judgments and has a desire to bring about collective judgments\nthat coincide with those judgments. In particular, suppose, for the mo-\nment, that each committee member cares first and foremost about bring-\ning about a tenure decision that coincides with his or her own judgment\non what the tenure decision should be: so individuals 2 and 3 would\nlike to bring about a negative tenure decision (of which they are each\nconvinced), while only individual 1 would like to bring about a positive\none (of which she is equally convinced). (Below I describe this particular\nmotivation of the committee members as outcome-oriented and contrast\nit with an alternative, reason-oriented motivation. Although the present\nexample assumes an outcome-oriented motivation, the more general\nresults on strategic manipulability and strategy-proofness below require\nno such assumption.)\nNow suppose that the committee uses the premise-based procedure.\nIf all individuals reveal their judgments truthfully, then, as shown above,\nthe conclusion will be accepted and the candidate will be granted ten-\nure. Individual 1 wishes to achieve this outcome, but individuals 2 and\n3 would be unhappy with it. On reflection, individual 2 realizes that, if\nList Discursive Dilemma 389\nshe falsely expresses the judgment that the candidate is not excellent\nin teaching (i.e., that R1 does not hold), contrary to her truthful view,\nthen the majority judgment on the candidate\u2019s teaching performance\nwill change from a positive to a negative one (i.e., from the acceptance\nof R1 to its rejection); by implication the candidate will be denied tenure,\nwhich is individual 2\u2019s preferred outcome. Likewise, individual 3 realizes\nthat, if she falsely expresses the judgment that the candidate is not\nexcellent in research (i.e., that R2 does not hold), contrary to her truth-\nful view, she can change the majority judgment on the candidate\u2019s re-\nsearch performance and bring about a negative tenure decision, which\nis individual 3\u2019s preferred outcome. So individuals 2 and 3 each have\nan incentive to strategically misrepresent their judgments, so as to bring\nabout an outcome they each prefer: a negative tenure decision.\nBy contrast, suppose the committee uses the conclusion-based pro-\ncedure. If all individuals reveal their judgments truthfully\u2014here only\njudgments on the conclusion are revealed\u2014then, as shown above, the\nconclusion will be rejected and the candidate will be denied tenure.\nIndividuals 2 and 3 wish to achieve this outcome and have every incentive\nto reveal their negative judgment on the conclusion truthfully. Individ-\nual 1 wishes to grant the candidate tenure but can do no better than\nto express this judgment truthfully.\nIn this example, the individuals all have an incentive to reveal their\njudgments truthfully under the conclusion-based procedure but not\nunder the premise-based one. Curiously, if the individuals all act on\ntheir incentives here\u2014which is what rational choice theory predicts\u2014\nthen the outcome under the two procedures is exactly the same. Under\nboth procedures, the candidate is denied tenure, albeit via different\nroutes. Under the conclusion-based procedure, the outcome is brought\nabout through a truthful majority judgment on the conclusion itself.\nUnder the premise-based procedure, it is brought about through stra-\ntegically manipulated majority judgments on the premises.\nStrategic Manipulability and Strategy-Proofness\nI have illustrated that the premise-based procedure may give individuals\nan incentive to strategically misrepresent their judgments, while the\nconclusion-based procedure, at least in the example, gives individuals\nan incentive to reveal their judgments truthfully. This suggests that the\npremise- and conclusion-based procedures may affect the behavior of\nindividuals differently.\nI now address the incentives generated by a decision procedure\nmore generally. Consider any decision procedure, that is, any method\nof generating collective judgments on the propositions in the public\nagenda on the basis of the group members\u2019 individual judgments. When\n390 Ethics January 2006\ndoes an individual have the opportunity to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the collective\ndecision by strategically misrepresenting her judgments?\nManipulability.\u2014Given a combination of individual judgments, a\ndecision procedure is manipulable by some individual on some propo-\nsition if the following two conditions hold (Dietrich and List 2004b):\n(i) if the individual reveals her judgments on all propositions truthfully,\nthen the collective judgment on the proposition in question differs from\nthe individual\u2019s own judgment on that proposition; (ii) if the individual\nstrategically misrepresents her judgments on some propositions, then\nthe collective judgment on the proposition in question coincides with\nthe individual\u2019s truthful judgment on that proposition.\nFor example, given the combination of individual judgments in\ntable 1, the premise-based procedure is manipulable by individual 2 on\nproposition C and also manipulable by individual 3 on proposition C.\nIn each case, conditions i and ii in the definition of manipulability are\nmet.\nNow, if an individual has the opportunity to manipulate the col-\nlective judgment on some proposition (as captured by the definition of\nmanipulability just given) and she cares sufficiently strongly about her\nown judgment on that proposition, then her opportunity to manipulate\ntranslates into an incentive to manipulate, and she may well act on that\nincentive. A decision procedure that never creates any opportunities for\nstrategic manipulation meets the demand of strategy-proofness (Dietrich\nand List 2004b):\nStrategy-proofness.\u2014There exists no admissible combination of in-\ndividual judgments for which the decision procedure is manipulable by\nany individual on any proposition.\nAn Impossibility Result\nAre there any strategy-proof decision procedures? More precisely, are\nthere any decision procedures that meet the demand of strategy-proof-\nness together with some of the demands introduced earlier? Clearly,\nnot all of the earlier demands can be imposed, as I have already shown\nthem to be mutually incompatible. In particular, instead of majoritarian\nor systematic responsiveness, let me require only the following demand,\ntogether with the demands of anonymity and decisiveness.\nRespect for unanimity.\u2014If all individuals unanimously judge some\nproposition to be true, then the proposition is also collectively judged\nto be true.\nNote that this demand has no force when there is no unanimous\nagreement between individuals. The following result has been proved\nby Dietrich and List (2004b).\nProposition 3: For the public agenda of a conjunctive or dis-\nList Discursive Dilemma 391\njunctive decision problem, there exists no decision procedure that\nmeets the demands of pluralism, strategy-proofness, respect for\nunanimity, anonymity, decisiveness, and integrity.27\nAgain, the result describes a trade-off between some arguably plau-\nsible demands. How can this trade-off be solved? As before, each demand\ncan in principle be relaxed. Let me revisit the preferred escape routes\nfrom the perspectives of the minimal liberal and comprehensive delib-\nerative accounts.\nShrinking the public agenda.\u2014If the public agenda is shrunk so as to\ncontain only the conclusion (or multiple unconnected propositions),\nthen the impossibility problem disappears. In particular, the conclusion-\nbased procedure is strategy-proof. As a vote is taken only on a single\nproposition, namely, the conclusion, each individual\u2019s best strategy\u2014\nthe one most likely to lead to the individual\u2019s preferred outcome\u2014is\nalways to reveal her judgment on that conclusion truthfully. Apart from\nshrinking the public agenda, the conclusion-based procedure meets all\nother demands used in proposition 3. So the minimal liberal approach\nprovides a way to avoid the present impossibility problem too.\nRelaxing responsiveness.\u2014Since the responsiveness condition has al-\nready been considerably relaxed\u2014neither majoritarian nor systematic\nresponsiveness is required\u2014there is less room for any relaxations here.\nOne might consider relaxing respect for unanimity, although technical\nwork suggests that relaxing this demand alone does not open up prom-\nising possibilities.28 Again, relaxing anonymity is unattractive. Finally,\nrelaxing decisiveness is an option just as before, but unanimitarian or\nsupermajoritarian decision procedures\u2014which are strategy-proof\u2014have\nthe potential disadvantage of leaving many propositions undecided.\nIn summary, while the minimal liberal account has a preferred\nescape route from the present impossibility problem at its disposal, the\ncomprehensive deliberative account does not and is therefore faced with\na serious challenge here. Ultimately, proponents of the comprehensive\ndeliberative account may have no choice but to relax the formal demand\nof strategy-proofness itself and either accept the occurrence of strategic\nmanipulation\u2014which seems undesirable from a comprehensive delib-\nerative perspective\u2014or find other ways of inducing individuals to reveal\ntheir judgments truthfully.\nAs noted above, proponents of the comprehensive deliberative\naccount will advocate not only the publicity of reasons but also the\n27. Again, assuming three or more individuals. In fact, the proposition holds for a\nlarger class of public agendas called \u201cpath-connected\u201d (Dietrich and List 2004b).\n28. When the public agenda contains \u201crich\u201d logical interconnections, even a weaker\ndemand than respect for unanimity\u2014weak responsiveness\u2014is inconsistent with the other\ndemands (Dietrich and List 2004b).\n392 Ethics January 2006\nuse of public deliberation in collective decisions. It has been suggested\nthat, when people reveal their views in public deliberation rather than\nanonymous aggregation, they are less likely to act strategically. There\nare at least two possible mechanisms for this, an incentive-based one\nand a psychological one (Mackie 1998; Dryzek and List 2003). Ac-\ncording to the incentive-based mechanism, a potential manipulator is\nat greater risk of being exposed in a setting of social interaction than\nin an anonymous ballot, and being exposed as a manipulator is costly,\nboth in terms of achieving the preferred decision outcome and in\nterms of one\u2019s reputation (Brennan and Pettit 2004). If this mecha-\nnism is in operation in a public deliberative setting, then individuals\nhave less of an incentive to act strategically there. According to the\npsychological mechanism, people adopt a more cooperative disposi-\ntion when they socially interact with each other and they focus more\non the group\u2019s perspective than on their own individual perspective.\nIf this mechanism is in operation in a public deliberative setting, then,\nagain, individuals are less likely to act strategically there, even if stra-\ntegic incentives are present.\nOf course, it is still an open question to what extent any such mech-\nanism can be relied upon to induce individuals to reveal their judgments\ntruthfully. At this point, one must note a serious trade-off between the\ndemands that a comprehensive deliberative account seeks to impose on\na decision procedure and the demand of strategy-proofness.\nThe Strategic Equivalence of the Premise- and Conclusion-Based Procedures\nI have noted a curious aspect of the tenure example above. If the com-\nmittee members all act on their assumed incentives in that example\u2014\nsome reveal truthful judgments, some strategically misrepresent their\njudgments, as appropriate\u2014then the outcome under the premise- and\nconclusion-based procedures is exactly the same. This is strikingly at\nodds with the standard claim\u2014reinforced in this article\u2014that the prem-\nise- and conclusion-based procedures may lead to different outcomes\nfor the same combination of individual judgments. Under what con-\nditions does that curiosity occur?\nI assumed above that the committee members are each convinced\nof their own judgments and have a desire to bring about collective\njudgments that coincide with those judgments, but that they care pri-\nmarily about the final tenure decision itself. Let me introduce a general\nconceptual distinction (Dietrich and List 2004b). Consider again a con-\njunctive or disjunctive decision problem. An individual may not be able\nto bring about collective judgments that coincide with her own judg-\nments on every proposition. If she cannot, she may care particularly\nabout certain propositions and less about others. The individual has\noutcome-oriented preferences if her desire is first and foremost to bring about\nList Discursive Dilemma 393\na collective judgment on the conclusion that coincides with her own\nindividual judgment on that conclusion. This was the assumption in the\ntenure example. By contrast, the individual has reason-oriented preferences\nif her desire is first and foremost to bring about collective judgments\non the premises that coincide with her own individual judgments on\nthose premises. This is perhaps the motivation that deliberative dem-\nocrats would like people to exhibit.\nGiven outcome-oriented preferences, as assumed in the tenure\nexample, it can be proved that the premise- and conclusion-based\nprocedures are strategically equivalent (Dietrich and List 2004b): under\nthe premise-based procedure, an individual with outcome-oriented\npreferences has an incentive to vote for every premise if she accepts\nthe conclusion and against every premise otherwise. If all individuals\nadopt this strategy, then the premise-based procedure always generates\nthe same decision on the conclusion as the conclusion-based one,\nwhose outcome is the result of a truthful vote on the conclusion.\nParadoxically, for outcome-oriented preferences, the mechanical dif-\nferences between the two procedures are \u201ccancelled out\u201d by their be-\nhavioral differences.\nBy contrast, given reason-oriented preferences, the two procedures\nare not strategically equivalent. Also, given reason-oriented preferences,\nindividuals will not misrepresent their judgments under the premise-\nbased procedure, as they seek to bring about collective judgments on\nthe premises that coincide with their own individual judgments on those\npremises. It might be speculated that a public deliberative setting is\nmore likely to induce reason-oriented preferences, while a minimal lib-\neral setting is more likely to induce outcome-oriented preferences. If\nthat speculation were correct, the mechanical differences between the\npremise- and conclusion-based procedures would not be \u201ccancelled out\u201d\nby their behavioral differences but, perhaps, rather reinforced by them;\nfurthermore, neither decision procedure would be faced with significant\nproblems of strategic manipulation. But this thought still remains a\nspeculation.\nVIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS: TOWARD A UNIFIED ACCOUNT\nOverview\nIn this article, I have introduced the minimal liberal and comprehensive\ndeliberative accounts of collective decision making and argued that they\ncan be associated with two different decision procedures: the conclusion-\nand premise-based ones. I have compared the two procedures in several\nrespects. I have investigated when and how often they disagree, assessed\nthem in terms of general demands on collective decision making, and\nshown which demands they satisfy and which not. I have also compared\n394 Ethics January 2006\ntheir truth-tracking performance in decisions on factual matters and\naddressed the incentives they create for decision makers. What are the\nkey differences between the two procedures?\nThe size of the public agenda.\u2014The public agenda is usually specified\nmore narrowly for the conclusion-based procedure, while it is specified\nmore broadly for the premise-based one.\nThe order of priority among the propositions.\u2014The conclusion-based\nprocedure prioritizes the conclusion: it forms a collective judgment\ndirectly and only on the conclusion on the basis of the individual judg-\nments on that conclusion. The premise-based procedure prioritizes the\npremises: it forms collective judgments directly on the premises on the\nbasis of the individual judgments on those premises; it then derives the\ncollective judgment on the conclusion from those collective judgments\non the premises.\nThe strategic incentives created by the two procedures.\u2014The conclusion-\nbased procedure is strategy-proof, while the premise-based procedure\nis vulnerable to the strategic misrepresentation of individual judgments.\nIn this final section, I revisit these key differences between the\npremise- and conclusion-based procedures and suggest that they deter-\nmine under what conditions one procedure is more adequate than the\nother. In particular, I ask whether instead of associating the two pro-\ncedures with two diametrically opposed accounts of decision making\u2014\nthe minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative ones\u2014both pro-\ncedures can be embedded in a unified account in between the two ideal-\ntypical extremes. Although I am unable to offer such an account here,\nI hope to sketch some of its likely elements.\nThe Size of the Public Agenda\nThe minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts in their\nmost extreme forms specify the public agenda in opposite ways: one\nmakes it as narrow as possible, the other as broad as possible. But the\nappropriate public agenda may vary from one decision problem to an-\nother, and hence the appropriate decision procedure may also vary.\nWhat is the appropriate public agenda for a given decision problem?\nFor almost every decision problem, certain types of propositions,\nnamely, those on practical actions or policies, need to be included in\nthe public agenda. But sometimes it may also be appropriate to include\npropositions on supporting reasons or other background consider-\nations. As noted above, a Rawlsian criterion for the inclusion of such\npropositions might be whether they are \u201cpolitical\u201d rather than \u201cmeta-\nphysical\u201d ones: propositions capable of being supported by an overlap-\nping consensus within the relevant group as opposed to ones on which\nthere is irresolvable disagreement based on different worldviews. When\na wide range of people endorse certain reasons\u2014even if they endorse\nList Discursive Dilemma 395\nthem on the basis of different worldviews\u2014then the public resolution\nof these reasons may enhance the legitimacy and stability of a decision.\nHowever, when reasons are controversial and divisive, their public res-\nolution may have the opposite effect.\nShould factual propositions always be included in the public\nagenda? If a proposition is clearly factual and its resolution poses no\ngreat difficulties, then the answer is probably positive. But whether a\nproposition is factual may itself be controversial. While some proposi-\ntions may be unambiguously factual, others are considered factual by\nsome people and value laden or nonfactual by others. In the global\nwarming example, all propositions are factual ones; the first premise\nconcerns a contingent fact about the state of the world, the second a\ngeneral physical mechanism; still, some critics might describe these\npropositions as value laden. In the tenure example, the propositions\nabout the candidate\u2019s performance in research and teaching both in-\nvolve a complex combination of facts and values. In the habitat pro-\ntection example, the status of the premises is unclear; there may be\nsubstantial disagreement on whether they are factual or not.\nOn many kinds of propositions\u2014such as ethical or aesthetic\nones\u2014we can distinguish between cognitivist and noncognitivist views.\nCognitivists ascribe truth values to these propositions, while noncog-\nnitivists interpret them as expressions of attitudes or sentiments. Dis-\nagreements between cognitivists and noncognitivists may affect not\nonly the question of where to draw the line between factual and non-\nfactual propositions but also the question of what propositions to in-\nclude in the public agenda. Those who hold a cognitivist view on a\nlarger class of propositions may endorse a larger public agenda; those\nwho hold a noncognitivist view on a larger class of propositions may\nendorse a smaller one.\nFinally, even when people agree that a proposition is factual, they\nmay still be so divided over that proposition\u2019s truth value that it is\nbetter to exclude the proposition from the public agenda. Consider,\nfor example, a proposition about the existence of God. Many theists\nand atheists share the belief that this proposition is factual, yet they\nare deeply divided over its truth value. I conclude that an important\nelement of a unified account of collective decision making will be a\nset of criteria that size the public agenda differently for different de-\ncision problems.\nThe Order of Priority among the Propositions\nAs noted above, the conclusion- and premised-based procedures\u2014in\nline with the minimal liberal and comprehensive deliberative accounts\u2014\nprioritize the propositions differently. The order of priority among the\npropositions matters in at least two respects.\n396 Ethics January 2006\nFirst, it determines whether or not the reasoning process over the\npropositions\u2014the drawing of logical inferences\u2014is \u201ccollectivized\u201d and,\nif it is, what the precise structure of that reasoning process is. Different\ndecision problems may require a different collective reasoning process\n(if any) and therefore a different decision procedure.\nSecond, the order of priority among the propositions may affect a\ndecision procedure\u2019s capacity to track the truth on the propositions. A\nwell-chosen order of priority\u2014such as one that gives priority to prop-\nositions for which Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption is met by the\ndecision makers\u2014can improve that capacity. The order of priority may\nalso affect the relative likelihood of false positive and false negative\ndecisions and may thus be relevant to the particular asymmetry between\nfalse positives and false negatives in a given decision problem. As the\n\u201cepistemically appropriate\u201d order of priority may vary from one decision\nproblem to another, the appropriate decision procedure may also vary.\nA key element of a unified account of collective decision making\nwill therefore be not only a set of criteria for identifying the appropriate\norder of priority among the propositions for a given decision problem\nbut also a method for making decisions based on that order. A decision\nprocedure along these lines can be stated as follows.\nA sequential priority decision procedure.\u2014First, an order of priority\namong the propositions in the public agenda is specified. Earlier prop-\nositions are interpreted as \u201cprior to\u201d later ones, capable of serving as\nreasons for or against later ones. Second, the group considers the prop-\nositions in that order. For each proposition under consideration, if the\nproposition is unconstrained by propositions considered earlier, then\nthe group decides the new proposition by majority voting (or some\nother single-proposition decision rule); but if it is constrained by prop-\nositions considered earlier (such as a conclusion constrained by earlier\npremises), then the group derives its judgment on the new proposition\nfrom its judgments on those earlier propositions (List 2004).\nThe premise- and conclusion-based procedures are both special\ncases of a sequential priority decision procedure, albeit for a different\nspecification of the public agenda. The conclusion-based procedure is\na sequential priority procedure applied to a simple public agenda con-\ntaining only the conclusion, where that conclusion is (trivially) priori-\ntized. The premise-based procedure is a sequential priority procedure\napplied to a nonsimple public agenda of a conjunctive or disjunctive\ndecision problem, where the premises and the appropriate logical re-\nlation are given priority over the conclusion. A unified account that\nallows a flexible specification of both the public agenda and the order\nof priority among the propositions may therefore adequately cover both\ndecision problems in which a premise-based approach is more adequate\nand ones in which a conclusion-based approach is more adequate.\nList Discursive Dilemma 397\nTABLE 4\nTable 2 (Restated)\nR1 R2 R3 C \u2194 (R1 or R2 or R3) C\nIndividual 1 True False False True True\nIndividual 2 False True False True True\nIndividual 3 False False True True True\nMajority False False False True True\nThe Strategic Incentives Created by the Two Procedures\nIn recommending what decision procedure to use for a given decision\nproblem, a unified account of decision making should also take into\naccount whether any mechanisms are in place for inducing decision\nmakers to reveal their judgments truthfully. These mechanisms might\nbe incentive-based or psychological, as discussed above, and different\ncontexts may require different such mechanisms. Clearly, more research\nis required here.\nThe Noninvariance of Collective Decisions under Changes in the Public\nAgenda and under Changes in the Order of Priority among the Propositions\nFinally, let me observe an important property that a unified account of\ncollective decision making will exhibit: for the same underlying structure\nof individual judgments, the collective judgments generated by an ap-\npropriate decision procedure will not generally be invariant under\nchanges in the public agenda and under changes in the order of priority\namong the propositions. To illustrate this point, consider three different\ndecision problems with the same underlying structure of individual judg-\nments as shown in table 4 (a restatement of table 2 above).\nThe first decision problem is the habitat protection case, as dis-\ncussed above. The second is the case of a three-member court that has\nto reach a verdict in a criminal case. The defendant might have com-\nmitted one of three different crimes (R1, R2, or R3). Each judge thinks\nthat the defendant is guilty of one crime and, hence, that he should go\nto prison (C), but the judges disagree on which crime it is. Nonetheless,\nthe judges unanimously agree that the defendant should go to prison.\nThe third problem is that of another three-member court that has to\ndecide whether to repeat a trial (C) (Pettit 2001a). The trial should be\nrepeated if and only if at least one of three procedural flaws has oc-\ncurred: some of the evidence was inadmissible (R1), the confession was\nforced (R2), or some other rule of due process was violated (R3). All\njudges think that the trial was procedurally flawed and that it should\n398 Ethics January 2006\nbe repeated, although they disagree on how exactly it was flawed. How\nmight a unified account address these three decision problems?\nThe public agenda.\u2014In the habitat case, as argued above, there may\nbe good reasons for excluding the premises from the public agenda\nand including in it only the conclusion. In the prison sentence case,\nthere is every reason for including all the premises and the conclusion\nin the public agenda, as the court needs to provide a legal justification\nfor its verdict. In the retrial case, again there seem to be good (though\nperhaps slightly weaker) reasons for including all the premises and the\nconclusion in the public agenda.\nThe order of priority among the propositions.\u2014Again, as suggested above,\nin the habitat case, it may be appropriate to prioritize the conclusion.\nIn the prison sentence case, there seem to be strong reasons for pri-\noritizing the premises, first, because they serve as the normatively sig-\nnificant reasons and, second, because this reduces the risk of a false\npositive decision\u2014which should be reduced to protect the defendant.\nIn the retrial case, the order of priority is less clear. But there may be\ngood reasons for prioritizing the conclusion rather than the premises\nin this case, as this reduces the risk of a false negative decision\u2014which\nshould be reduced here to protect the defendant.\nIf the public agenda and the order of priority are specified as\nI have suggested, then a sequential priority decision procedure, ap-\nplied to each case, will implement a conclusion-based approach in the\nhabitat case, a premise-based one in the prison sentence case, and a\nconclusion-based one in the retrial case. So, for the same structure of\nindividual judgments, the outcome is the acceptance of the conclusion\nin the habitat and retrial cases, and its rejection in the prison sentence\ncase. But even in the habitat and retrial cases the conclusion is accepted\nthrough a different route. In the habitat case, it is accepted because\nthe public agenda contains only the conclusion, which is thereby au-\ntomatically prioritized. In the retrial case, it is accepted because, al-\nthough the premises are also contained in the public agenda, the con-\nclusion is prioritized so as to avoid a false negative decision.\nIn conclusion, the present considerations show that the structure\nof individual judgments underdetermines the appropriate decision at\nthe collective level. An adequate decision procedure will neither aggre-\ngate these judgments mechanically nor systematically prioritize either\nthe premises or the conclusion. Rather, its decision will depend on the\nnature of the public agenda and on the appropriate order of priority\namong the propositions. In short, its decision will depend on the sphere\nof public reason appropriate for the decision problem in question. Often\nthe question of what that sphere of public reason is will itself be under\ndebate. But I hope to have shown that an answer to this question is\nimportant for a resolution of the discursive dilemma.\nList Discursive Dilemma 399\nAppendix\nTables for the Sketch Proof of Proposition 1\nTABLE A1\nAn Odd Number of Individuals , Wherenp 3\u0002 2m m \u2265 0\nR1 R2 C \u2194 (R1 & R2) C\nIndividual 1 True True True True\nIndividual 2 True False True False\nIndividual 3 False True True False\nIndividuals 4, . . . , 3 \u0002 m True False True False\nIndividuals 3 \u0002 m\u0002 1, . . . , 3 \u0002 2m False True True False\nMajority True True True False\nTABLE A2\nAn Even Number of Individuals , Wherenp 6\u0002 2m m \u2265 0\nR1 R2 C \u2194 (R1 & R2) C\nIndividuals 1, 2 True True True True\nIndividuals 3, 4 True False True False\nIndividuals 5, 6 False True True False\nIndividuals 7, . . . , 6 \u0002 m True False True False\nIndividuals 6 \u0002 m \u0002 1, . . . , 6 \u0002 2m False True True False\nMajority True True True False\nTables A1 and A2 can be modified for a public agenda containing only\nR1, R2, , and their negations.

Tables A1 and A2 can also easily be modifiedR & R1 2\nfor a disjunctive decision problem or a public agenda containing only\nR1, R2, R1 or R2 (or only R1, R2, ), and their negations.R r R1 2\nTABLE A3\nnp 4\nR1 R2 C \u2194 (R1 & R2) C\nIndividual 1 True True True True\nIndividual 2 True False True False\nIndividual 3 False True True False\nIndividual 4 True True False False\nMajority True True True False\n400 Ethics January 2006\nTable A3 can be modified for a disjunctive decision problem but\nnot for a public agenda containing only R1, R2, (or ,R & R R r R1 2 1 2\nor R1 or R2), and their negations. To obtain an impossibility result for\nthat agenda, the integrity demand must be slightly strengthened, so as\nto impose a deductive closure demand. Finally, modifications of all tables\nfor more than two premises are also straightforward.\nSketch Proof of the Results on the Conditions under Which the\nPremise-Based Procedure Outperforms the Conclusion-Based\nProcedure\nI sketch a proof for a conjunctive decision problem; the proof for a\ndisjunctive decision problem is analogous. First consider the premise-\nbased procedure. Each individual satisfies Condorcet\u2019s competence as-\nsumption for each premise Ri, so the group\u2019s (positive and negative)\nreliability on each of R1, . . . , Rk approaches 1 with increasing group\nsize. Therefore, the probability that all of R1, . . . , Rk are correctly\ndecided by a majority\u2014the product of the group\u2019s reliability levels on\nR1, . . . , Rk\u2014also approaches 1, and the probability of a correct decision\non the conclusion C under the premise-based procedure approaches 1,\nregardless of whether C is true or false. Further, the correct decision\non C is likely to be made \u201cfor the right reasons\u201d (Bovens and Rabinowicz\n2005), as all of R1, . . . , Rk are likely to be judged correctly by a majority.\nNext consider the conclusion-based procedure. Each individual judges\nthe conjunction (and hence C) to be true only if heR & . . . & R1 k\nor she judges all of R1, . . . , Rk to be true. If all of R1, . . . , Rk (and\nC) are true, then each individual has a probability p of judging each Ri\nto be true, and hence a probability pk of judging (andR & . . . & R1 k\nC) to be true. As p is between 0.5 and , it follows that pk is belowk\u00010.5\n0.5. By the reverse of Condorcet\u2019s jury theorem, the probability that C\nis judged to be true by a majority approaches 0 with increasing group\nsize; so the positive reliability of the group decision on C under the\nconclusion-based procedure approaches 0. If at least one of R1, . . . ,\nRk (and thus C) is false, then each individual has a probability greater\nthan 0.5 of judging at least one of R1, . . . , Rk (and thus C) to be false.\nSo the probability that C is judged to be false by a majority approaches\n1 with increasing group size; so the negative reliability of the group\ndecision on C under the conclusion-based procedure approaches 1.\nSketch Proof of the Results on the Conditions under Which the\nConclusion-Based Procedure Outperforms the Premise-Based\nProcedure\nI sketch a proof for a disjunctive decision problem; the proof for a\nconjunctive decision problem is analogous. First consider the conclu-\nsion-based procedure. If the disjunction R1 or . . . or Rk (and hence\nC) is false, then each individual has a probability p greater than 0.5 of\njudging that disjunction (and C) to be false. If the disjunction R1 or\n. . . or Rk (and hence C) is true, then each individual has a probability\nList Discursive Dilemma 401\np greater than 0.5 of judging it (and C) to be true. So each individual\nsatisfies Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption for the conclusion, and\nhence the group\u2019s (positive and negative) reliability on C approaches\n1 with increasing group size. Next consider the premise-based proce-\ndure. If the disjunction R1 or . . . or Rk (and hence C) is false, then\neach individual has a probability p greater than 0.5 of judging each of\nR1, . . . , Rk to be false, and so the probability that each premise and\nhence the conclusion will be rejected under the premise-based proce-\ndure approaches 1 with increasing group size; thus the negative reli-\nability of the group decision on C under the premise-based procedure\napproaches 1. But if the disjunction R1 or . . . or Rk (and hence C) is\ntrue, then each individual\u2019s probability pi of judging each Ri to be true\nis still below 0.5. So the probability that each premise and hence the\nconclusion will still be rejected under the premise-based procedure ap-\nproaches 1 with increasing group size; thus the positive reliability of the\ngroup decision on C under the premise-based procedure approaches\n0. The fact that the \u201ccorrect\u201d premise Ri might receive a larger minority\nthan any other premise does not help. Regardless of whether C is true\nor false, the probability that the premise-based procedure leads to the\nrejection of C approaches 1 with increasing group size.\nREFERENCES\nArrow, Kenneth J. 1951.
