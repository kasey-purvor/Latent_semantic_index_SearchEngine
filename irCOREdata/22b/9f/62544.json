However this exactly \ndescribes the Arctic winter, and the Arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus \nregularly survives these extreme conditions and re-emerges in the spring. It is \nable to do this by reducing the amount of water in its body to almost zero: a \nprocess that is called \u201cprotective dehydration\u201d. The aim of this project was to \ngenerate clones and sequence data in the form of ESTs to provide a platform \nfor the future molecular characterisation of the processes involved in \nprotective dehydration. \n \nResults \nFive normalised libraries were produced from both desiccating and \nrehydrating populations of O. arcticus from stages that had previously been \ndefined as potentially informative for molecular analyses. A total of 16,379 \nEST clones were generated and analysed using Blast and GO annotation. 40% \nof the clones produced significant matches against the Swissprot and trembl \ndatabases and these were further analysed using GO annotation. Extraction \nand analysis of GO annotations proved an extremely effective method for \nidentifying generic processes associated with biochemical pathways, proving \nmore efficient than solely analysing Blast data output. A number of genes \nwere identified, which have previously been shown to be involved in water \ntransport and desiccation such as members of the aquaporin family. \nIdentification of these clones in specific libraries associated with desiccation \nvalidates the computational analysis by library rather than producing a global \noverview of all libraries combined. \n \nConclusions \nThis paper describes for the first time EST data from the arctic springtail (O. \narcticus). This significantly enhances the number of Collembolan ESTs in the \npublic databases, providing useful comparative data within this phylum. The \nuse of GO annotation for analysis has facilitated the identification of a wide \nvariety of ESTs associated with a number of different biochemical pathways \ninvolved in the dehydration and recovery process in O. arcticus. \n \n \n \n \n 2\nBackground \n \nThe mechanisms by which organisms survive extreme low temperatures are \nnot only of interest to ecologists, but also to a number of applied medical \nfields [1]. In this respect, one of the most amenable and studied groups of \norganisms is the Collembola (arthropods or springtails) where the \nphysiological processes behind such survival are well documented [2, 3]. They \npossess three main strategies to survive the cold: freeze tolerance, freeze \navoidance or protective dehydration [3-5]. Whilst most springtails use freeze \navoidance, it is the latter strategy of protective dehydration in the Arctic \nspringtail Onychiurus arcticus (Tullberg 1876) which is the subject of this \nstudy [5, 6]. In protective dehydration loss of water occurs across a diffusion \ngradient between the animal\u2019s super-cooled body fluids and ice in its \nsurroundings, such that freezing point depression always exceeds the \nenvironmental temperature experienced, and eventually the animals lose \nsufficient water to ensure that a freezing event cannot occur [5, 6]; the \nanimals desiccate. O. arcticus is widely distributed throughout the northern \nparts of the Palaearctic region [7-10] and is found in moist habitats; mainly in \nmosses and under large stones in the coastal areas of Svalbard, particularly \non glacial outwash fans and under bird cliffs [11]. Studies have shown that \nO.arcticus, exposed to sub-zero temperatures and low water vapor pressure \ninduces extensive dehydration through a highly permeable cuticle [5, 12, 13]. \nThis is combined with the rapid synthesis and accumulation of the \nmembrane\/protein cryoprotectant trehalose from glycogen [13-15].  \n \nWhilst there are a number of physiological and ecological studies on this \norganism (detailed above), there have been no molecular analyses to date \n(only O. groenlandicus has been bar-coded: AY665335, AY6653316, \nAY665323). This situation is not unusual, as the number of organisms where \nthere is even moderate amounts of sequence data are severely limited. \nHowever, genomics is being increasingly applied to the study of non-model \norganisms and ESTs are generally viewed as the most efficient and cost \neffective strategy for the identification of genes and generating a first pass \nscan of a genome [16, 17]. \n \nAs part of a larger project examining over-wintering strategies in polar \narthropods, we have generated 16,379 ESTs for O.arcticus from 5 cDNA \nlibraries of animals in different desiccation states. In this article we present \nthe analysis of these library data. This represents the first sequence data for \nthis organism and significantly increases the number of Collembolan ESTs in \nthe databases from the previous total of 8,686 produced from the springtail \nFolsomia candida [18]. \n \nResults and Discussion: \n \n 3\nCDNA libraries construction and characterisation \nFive libraries were produced from both desiccating and re-hydrating \npopulations of O. arcticus from stages that had previously been defined as \npotentially informative for molecular analyses [13].  \n\u2022 Library C: Controls \n\u2022 Library D1: Desiccating: animals at -2\u00b0C. This is the critical \ntemperature at which trehalose is significantly up-regulated at the \nexpense of stores of glycogen. \n\u2022 Library D2: Fully desiccated animals. \n\u2022 Library R1: Animals that had been recovering for 8 hours. \n\u2022 Library R2: Fully recovered animals.  \nFor more detail, see methods. A total of 16,552 clones were sequenced from \nthe 5\u2019 direction. This was reduced slightly to 16,379 clones after quality \nchecks, each of which had a minimum transcript size of 150bp and an \naverage of 550bp. Each library proportionally contributed between 17 and \n23% of the total EST dataset (Table 1). The libraries were normalised to \noptimise the chances of obtaining rare transcripts. Indeed, both gene \ndiversity and discovery ratios were high in all libraries, with a minimum \ndiversity score of 79% (61% for all libraries) and even the largest clusters \ncomprising only approximately 0.4% of any one library (Table 1). When \nsequence similarity searches were run on the processed sequences, on \naverage 40% produced significant matches (expect score in excess of 1e-10 \nand therefore can be regarded as putative known genes) against the \nsequence databases. This level of gene identification is not surprising and \nrecent  EST data generated from the springtail Folsomia candida \n(Timmermans et al, 2007) produced similar levels of BLAST identity. This is \nlargely because there are a limited number of insects that have been \nsequenced. The two main insects in the ensembl database [19] are \nDrosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, which are only related to \nO. arcticus at the Super class level (Hexopoda). Of the two, A. gambiae has \nmost recently been sequenced and the VectorBase genome build from June \n2007 (AgamP3) produced only 10% known genes from a 10 fold genome \nsequence coverage of 278Mb. Similarly recent EST data (in excess of 150,000 \nESTs) from the silkworm (Bombyx mori) only provides confirmation of 15% of \nthe predicted genes from the WGS project [20-22]. \n \nThe sequences from each library were further processed using Blast2GO [23], \nbut showed very similar compositions when defined in terms of their \nmolecular function (GO annotation level 2). An example of this output is \nshown for all libraries in Figure 1, with the majority of clones having either \ncatalytic or binding activities. Although the libraries were normalised, GOSSIP \n[24] was used to perform statistical analyses using pair-wise comparisons of \neach library with the control library to identify any potential enrichment for \nparticular genes or gene functions. No enrichment was found using the \ncorrected p-values of the False Discovery Rate, although there were a number \nof significant single test p-values. For example GO016860: intramolecular \noxidoreductase activity and GO008237: metalloexopeptidase activity were \nboth elevated in the desiccated library compared to the control with single \n 4\ntest p-values of 0.05, these were not significant using the False Discovery \nRate. The problem with such pair wise comparisons is that even though the \ncomparative library was always the control animals, the GO categories listed \nfor each pair wise comparison varied considerably and it was not possible \nusing this technique to make global statements of certain molecular functions \nbeing statistically enhanced in one library compared to the others. These data \ndo indicate that the normalisation procedure in the library production process \nwas relatively effective.  \n \nGO annotation \nThe decision was made to analyse the libraries using GO annotation rather \nthan keyword extraction from Blast comment lines, as GO categories are \nmore generic than gene names. This facilitates the comprehensive \nidentification of gene sets associated with biochemical pathways without in-\ndepth knowledge of individual pathway components and also where \npotentially multiple pathways exist for a particular process (cf. trehalose \n[25]). In the following discussion PGO refers to a Biological Process GO \nannotation; FGO is Molecular Function and CGO is Cellular component. \n \nInitially the focus of the searches concentrated on general processes such as \nresponse to water, water deprivation, abiotic stimulus, desiccation and \nQdrought recovery. Disappointingly only 11 clones were identified from the \nfive libraries, but even so, these did include some clones of further interest. \nPGO:0009414, response to water deprivation identified a putative aquaporin \n(the same clones were also identified under a specific GO search for \naquaporin) and PGO:0009415, response to water, produced ESTs with \nmatches to dehydrin which is induced in response to water stress in plants, \nthe latter of which would not have been identified using extraction of Blast \nkeyword data. Given the relative lack of success of the generic searches, \nspecific genes and pathways were targeted. Of the genes present in the \nlibraries, there was particular interest in identifying the following genes: \n\u2022 The trehalose and glycogen pathways (as trehalose is produced from \nglycogen during the desiccation process) [25]. \n\u2022 Aquaporins: 6 transmembrane domain proteins involved in water \ntransport [26- 27]. \n\u2022 Genes involved in cell protection, such as antioxidants \n\u2022 Genes involved in moulting, as moulting has previously been implicated \nin lowering the supercooling point and survival ability of Antarctic \nspringtails (Cryptopygus antarcticus) [28, 29]. \n\u2022 LEA (Late Embryogeneis Abundant) proteins, which have been shown \nto be involved in desiccation in a number of organisms [30]. \n \nTrehalose and glycogen pathways \nInitially the trehalose pathway was screened only for the GO molecular \nfunctions directly associated with it, but this revealed very few matching \nclones, with only 3 clones for FGO:0003825 (alpha, alpha-trehalose-\nphosphate synthase (UDP-forming) activity, none for FGO: 0015574 \n(trehalose transmembrane transporter activity) and 3 for FGO:0004805 \n 5\n(trehalose-phosphate activity) (Table 2). Because of the redundancy in levels \nof GO annotation, all six clones identified by the molecular processes matched \nthe same gene: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (probability and expect \nscores in excess of 493, 1.6 e-44). A similar situation occurred when identifying \ngenes involved in the glycogen pathway, in that a number of clones were \nidentified (137 in total), but many were to the same gene: glycogen \nphosphorylase which breaks up glycogen into glucose subunits.  \n \nFurther analysis was carried out on the trehalose pathway by expanding the \nsearch to the biological process PGO:0005991 (trehalose metabolic process). \nThis produced 19 matches in total. In-depth analysis of these revealed \nmatches to trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, trehalase precursor and a \nnumber of different protein kinases (Table 3). These included a serine-\nthreonine protein kinase from the yellow fever mosquito, which in humans is \ninvolved in phosphorylation and protein kinase A cAMP-dependant catalytic \nsubunit from the same organism. Phosphorylation is an integral process in \ntrehalose biosynthesis and degradation, so protein kinases are certainly \ninvolved. The question is, which ones? The GO annotations, whilst largely \nbased on mammalian data, provide immediate candidates for further analysis, \nwhich would not have been identified using screening of Blast outputs using \nspecific keywords for the trehalose pathway enzymes. It is interesting to note \nthat libraries produced from control animals did not contain any matches to \ntrehalase activity, which is associated with the breakdown of trehalose. \nHowever, this is to be expected as biochemical studies indicate that trehalose \nis largely absent in control animals and that it is only produced in response to \nthe desiccation process [13]. Also that the libraries prepared from the \ndesiccated animals contained the highest number of potential matches to \ntrehalose synthesis GO annotations, which is where it is expected that most \ntrehalose would be produced. \n \n \nAquaporins \nThese proteins are associated with water transport across membranes (Kruse \net al, 2006) and have the GO annotation: FGO:0015250: water channel \nactivity. Searches of all libraries revealed 7 clones in total (4 singletons and a \ncluster of 3) matching three potentially different aquaporin genes: \n\u2022 Q0IG28: Aquaporin 1 from Aedes aegypti. Two clones from control and \ndesiccating libraries (C and D1), matches in excess of P value = 177, \nexpect value = 9.7e-12. \n\u2022 Q9NHW7: Aquaporin AQPAe.a from Aedes aegypti. Two clones from \ndesiccated and recovering libraries (D2 and R2), matches in excess of \nP value = 512, expect value = 3.2 e-47 \n\u2022 UniRef100 000051A00B: Predicted similar to Drip CG9023_PB isoform \nB Apis mellifera. 1 cluster of 3 genes from the desiccated library (D2) \nwith a match of P value = 480, expect value = 7.7 e-44 \nTranslation of the individual clones and alignments confirmed that three \ndifferent aquaporin genes had been cloned (Figure 2A) with a maximum of \n49.4% amino acid identity between clones when compared over identical \n 6\nlengths (Figure 2B). The clones were all around 200 amino acids in length, \nwhich is approximately 80% of the expected length of an aquaporin gene. All \nclones included 5 complete transmembrane (TM) domains with TM6 present \nin sb_006_05H07 and partial in the two other clones. All three contained the \nclassical footprint of aquaporins: two NPA motifs, cysteine 181 was not \nconserved and only CL138 had the consensus site for N-linked glycosylation. \nThe consensus site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C was not present in \nany of the clones [31]. Homology between the clones was relatively low at a \nmaximum of 49.4%, but not surprising as homology within aquaporins is \ngenerally low. For example the maximum homology between the latest \naquaporin identified in mouse (AQP12) with the other mouse AQPs is 38.9% \n[32]. When the 328bp sequence from exon 1 of the gene for aquaporin-2 was \ncompared in 12 mammalian species, only 14 out of 109 amino acids were \nconserved throughout the mammalian aquaporin family, of these 13 were \nconserved in the springtail AQPs (Figure 2A). Identity of the springtail clones \nwas confirmed by phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3). All three clones clustered \nwith the other insect aquaporins extracted from the database. Interestingly all \ninsect clones clustered more strongly with the aquaglyceroporins, AQP8, the \nputative ancestral molecule [27] and AQP 11 and 12. Relatively little is known \nabout the latter two genes, but the human AQP12 is hypothesised to play a \nnovel intracellular role in digestive enzyme secretion [32]. Limited functional \nanalysis has been carried out on the insect aquaporins, but evidence points \ntoward them being designated as classical water channel molecules [33, 34]. \nCicadella viridis AQPcic has been shown to increase osmotic membrane water \npermeability when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the Aedes aegypti AQP \n(Accession number: Q9NHW7) gene was localised to tracheolar cells \nassociated with malpigian tubules and therefore it was hypothesised that this \nprotein played a role in the removal of tracheolar fluid during respiration. \n \nCell protection \nA general search for the level 2 GO annotation FGO:0016209 revealed 42 \npotential clones with antioxidant activity from all 5 libraries. However because \nof the complexity of the GO annotation network, further searches were \ncarried out for level 3 molecular functions and biological processes under \nspecific functions: hydrogen peroxide, melanin, catalase, superoxide \ndismutase, glutathione, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase \n(Table 4). These identified a greater number of clones (387), many of which \nwere duplicated between the libraries (data not shown). It is interesting to \nnote that the highest number of antioxidant clones were present in both the \ndesiccating and desiccated libraries (D1 and D2). From the percentages of \nclones present in each library for each antioxidant, the major components \nwould appear to be glutathione, catalase and hydrogen peroxidase, with \nmelanin and superoxide dismutase playing minor roles. \n \nMoulting \nProcesses involved in the survival of insects at low temperatures include the \nremoval or deactivation of ice nucleating agents, accumulation of \ncryoprotectants and thermal hysteresis proteins [35-38]. Moulting has \n 7\nrecently been shown to be associated with reduction of the supercooling point \n(SCP) and hence cryoprotection in Antarctic springtails (Crypotpygus \nantarcticus) [28, 29]. This might be expected to depress the SCP, because in \nCollembola the mid-gut and its entire contents are shed during moulting [39] \nresulting in the expulsion of potential ice nucleators in the animal gut. The \nphysiology and timing of moulting in O. arcticus has not been documented to \ndate, although with a rigid exoskeleton they clearly moult regularly in order to \ngrow. So genes and pathways involved in moulting were also investigated \nusing GO annotations (data not shown). A number of relevant genes were \nidentified for both juvenile hormone (a pleiotropic hormone, which in concert \nwith ecdysteroids orchestrates moulting and metamorphosis and may be \ninvolved in reproduction in some species) and members of the ecdysone \npathway. The latter included the ecdysone receptor and the protein \nultraspiracle (XR2C) chorion factor. In addition to a considerable number of \nputative transcription factors and chromatin remodelling subunits were \nidentified.  It was interesting to note that more matches were found in the \nactively desiccating (D1) and recovering animals (LIBs R1 and R2) (10, 24 \nand 14 respectively, total = 48) compared to only 8 in the control and 5 in \nthe desiccated populations. Thus indicating that moulting may either play a \nrole in the desiccation process, or potentially is triggered in some animals by \nthe cellular stress involved in desiccation and recovery.  We are currently \ninvestigating the role of moulting in desiccation of O. arcticus using a \nbiochemical test for 20-hydroxy ecdysone and are also actively collecting \nanimals that have either just moulted or are in the process of moulting for \nmore detailed molecular analysis. \n \nLea proteins \nOf the genes and pathways under investigation, only LEA proteins were \nwithout GO annotations. So a search was made of the ESTs using Blast \nannotations. Identification of LEAs is problematical as these proteins are not \nhighly conserved [30]. Comparison of LEA proteins between different species \nreveals only 53.5% identity between two cereal crops (Q42376: LEA3, maize \nand Q03968: LEA3, wheat), which reduces dramatically to 27.2% between \ndifferent phyla such as chick pea and nematode (O49816 and Q95V77 \nrespectively). Even the 11 amino acid repeat unit, which is a feature of LEAs \nshows little conservation with only 1 or 2 identical amino acids between chick \npea and the nematode Aphelenus avenae. Searches of the O. arcticus BLAST \nannotations revealed a cluster of two clones present in Library D2 (desiccated \nanimals) and a single clone in Library D1 (desiccating animals). This is exactly \nwhere such genes would be expected if they were involved in the desiccation \nprocess. Translation of all three clones and alignments indicated that only one \ngene was present. The primary BLAST match results for this clone against the \ndatabases were to Q1DH19, a putative uncharacterised protein from the \nyellow fever mosquito. After a number of subsequent matches to \nuncharacterised insect proteins, there were then matches to abhydrolase \ngenes and LEA proteins (Oryza sativa) with probability and expect scores for \nthe latter of 179 and 6.4e-11 (Figure 4). At the amino acid level, identities \n 8\nwere low with the best match to the uncharacterised protein showing 45% \nidentity and the LEA protein, 31%.  \nDatabase searches of LEA proteins can produce matches to abhydrolase \ngenes (as happened with this clone), due to the presence of an abhydrolase \ndomain (denoted in Figure 4). Abhydrolases are a largely uncharacterised \nprotein family, but members of this family do contain domains with hydrolase \nactivity and therefore could potentially be involved in desiccation \nbiochemistry. Phylogenetic analysis of the O. arcticus translated gene \nfragment suggests that this fragment most closely matches the ABHD_A (or \nABHD_10) abhydrolase domain (data not shown). The question remains, is \nthis clone sb_009_02E03 an LEA or an abhydrolase? This is virtually \nimpossible to answer with short sequence fragments and the answer may \nbecome apparent with the full-length sequence, the cloning of which by RACE \nPCR is now underway. Also Western blotting studies are being carried out on \nO. arcticus  using heterologous probing of a LEA antibody to identify such \nproteins via an alternative route. \n \nDifferences between the libraries \nAll libraries were normalised during the construction process and therefore in-\ndepth expression analysis was difficult. The primary aim of this EST \nproduction was to produce clones for a microarray and therefore \nnormalisation was considered the best option for maximising gene discovery. \nHowever, lack or gain of gene expression could be inferred by presence or \nabsence in some libraries. Certainly some GO annotations revealed similar \ndistributions and levels of function across all libraries. But where very specific \nenzyme reactions or genes were identified some differences between libraries \ncould be discerned using a plus\/minus system cf. aquaporins and putative \nLEAs, as discussed above (Table 5). The identification of candidate genes for \ninvolvement in the desiccation process and some generalised differential \nexpression between libraries has to be further verified using more \ncomprehensive laboratory analyses such as RACE PCR to obtain full-length \nclones, microarrays and Q-PCR. \n \n \nConclusion: \nThis paper describes, for the first time, EST data from the arctic springtail (O. \narcticus), significantly enhancing the number of Collembolan ESTs in the \npublic databases. 40% of the clones produced significant matches against \nSwissprot and trembl and these ESTs were further analysed using GO \nannotations. This facilitated the identification of genes involved in biochemical \npathways of interest, such as trehalose biosynthesis and moulting. The GO \nannotations produced a greater range of potential \u201cgenes\u201d for further \ninvestigation and was more effective at identifying genes in a particular \npathway than could have been identified using extraction of data from Blast. \nCandidate genes involved in the desiccation process were identified including \nthree members of the aquaporin family and a putative LEA protein. These \ngenes are under further investigation. The GO annotations identified in this \npublication will be used to automatically extract EST clone ids from in-house \n 9\nproduced insect libraries to target further investigations into over-wintering \nsurvival of insects in extreme environments. This will include construction of \ncustomised microarrays. \n \n 10\nMethods \n \nSample collection and preparation \nOnychiurus arcticus, were collected under the bird cliffs at Stuphallet and \nKrykkefjellet on the Br\u00f8ggerhalv\u00f8ya, near Ny \u00c5lesund, Spitsbergen, Svalbard, \nNorway (78\u00ba56\u2019N, 11\u00ba53\u2019E) and transported to the British Antarctic Survey \n(BAS), Cambridge, for analysis. Animals (mixture of both adult and juveniles) \nwere cultured in ventilated plastic boxes containing moss, lichen and soil \ntaken from field sites and fed on dried baker\u2019s yeast. Cultures were kept moist \nat +4\u00baC.  \n \nFive groups of animals were prepared for library production:  \n\u2022 Library C: Controls: live animals which were kept in a +4\u00b0C cabinet \n\u2022 Library D1: Desiccating: animals were cooled for two weeks from +2 to \n-2\u00b0C in culture pots containing a base of wet plaster of Paris\/charcoal \nat a rate of 2\u00b0C per week.  -2\u00b0C is the critical temperature at which \ntrehalose is significantly up-regulated at the expense of stores of \nglycerol. \n\u2022 Library D2: Fully Desiccated: animals were cooled from +2 to -14\u00b0C in \nculture pots containing a base of wet plaster of Paris\/charcoal at a rate \nof 2\u00b0C per week.  \n\u2022 Library R1: Recovering: animals from the -14\u00baC group were allowed to \nrecover at +5\u00b0C with moisture for 8 hours. \n\u2022 Library R2: Fully recovered: animals from the -14\u00baC group were \nallowed to recover at +5\u00b0C moisture for 24 hours. \nAll groups of animals were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80\u00b0C \nuntil required.  \n \nLibrary construction: \nTotal RNA was extracted from frozen (-80\u00b0C) samples of O. arcticus using TRI \nReagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA was \nsynthesized and normalized using a combination of the Trimmer-Direct kit \n(Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) and the SMART cDNA Library Construction kit (BD \nBiosciences Clontech, Palo-Alto, CA) according to the protocol from Evrogen \n[40]. Modifications to the protocol were made concerning the columns used \nfor size selection and the cloning vector: to improve clone size selection \nChroma spin 1000 were used instead of Chroma spin 400 (both BD \nBiosciences Clontech, Palo-Alto, CA) and pal32 (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) \nwas used for directional cloning with insertion between two SfiI sites \n(GGCCATTACGGCCGGG del(CATGTC) GGCCGCCTCGGCC. This procedure was \nchosen because of the low amount of starting material [41] and the \nnormalisation process increased the efficiency of rare transcript discovery [42, \n43]. Plasmids were transferred via electroporation to Escherichia coli (strain \nDH10B, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).  \n \ncDNA Sequencing \n 11\nPlasmids were isolated according to the method of [44] and 5\u2019end sequenced \nusing Dye Terminator Chemistry version 3.1 (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany) and \n3730XL ABI capillary sequencer systems (ABI, Weiterstadt, Germany). \n \nSequence analysis and EST clustering: \nSequence fasta files were processed using the script Trace2dbest [45], which \nincorporated the phred [46, 47] and crossmatch (P. Green, unpublished) \nprogrammes. A minimum cut-off value of 150bp was applied after quality \ncontrol processing for sequence database searching and for generating the \nsubmission file for dbEST [48] (Accession numbers, dbEST: 49109381-\n49125759, Genbank: EW744731-EW761109). Tgicl [49] was used for \nclustering the fasta files, incorporating quality scores, for each of the five \nlibraries, as well as for all the libraries together. The clusters were database \nsearched using Blastx [50] against the Uniprot\/Swissprot and Uniprot\/Trembl \ndatabases [51] (at 12\/06\/2007), with matches annotated for all scores with \nan expect score in excess of 1e-10. Sequences with a database match were \nthen further annotated using GO [52] (at 24\/07\/2007). Another view of the \ndata was generated by Blast2GO [23] using the non-redundant (nr) database \n[53]. With the Blast2Go annotation, the programme GOSSIP [24] was run to \nidentify any enrichment for GO annotations between the libraries. Sequence \nmanipulation was carried out using the EMBOSS suite of programmes [54]. \nSequences were clustered using ClustalW [55] and then subjected to \nphylogenetic analysis using the Phylip suite of programmes with \nbootstrapping [56] and displayed using MEGA4 [57]. Sequence alignments \nwere displayed using BoxShade v3.21 [58]. \n                 \n \nAuthors' contributions \nMC was the BAS Co-PI on the external funding, drafted the manuscript and \nlead the data analyses.
