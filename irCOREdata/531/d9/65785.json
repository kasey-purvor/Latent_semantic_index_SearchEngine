How \nmuch can someone who has knowledge of our genes really know \nabout us as an individual? How far can they peer into our souls? \n \nProfessor Bobrow: DNA has largely to do with chemistry and not with \nsouls. The answer today is that someone who really knows everything \nabout your DNA can predict with some accuracy whether you are very \nlikely to get or pass on one of about a hundred pretty common \ndiseases which are known to be inherited in a very simple way. \nBeyond that, at the moment, DNA has very limited predictive power \n \nexcerpt from \u2019The Radio 4 Commission\u2019 Radio Broadcast   \n \nIntroduction \nThe assertion that DNA is \u2018to do with chemistry and not with souls\u2019 is, in the context \nof the above discussion, to instate a specific set of ideas, about what DNA is and \nwhat science can do with it. The interviewer\u2019s question about how much a person\u2019s \nDNA can tell us about the fine details of their identity - where the word \u2018soul\u2019 stands \nto mean aspects of ourselves which are \u2018personal\u2019 and \u2018unique\u2019 \u2013 resonates with \nwidespread claims of the informational and diagnostic potential of this essential \nmolecule (e.g. Home Office, 2003a, Home Office, 2003b, Human Genetics \nCommission, 2001, Human Genetics Commission, 2002, Nuffield Council on \nBioethics, 2002).  Bobrow rejects the esoteric reference to \u2018soul\u2019 in favour of the \nexoteric \u2018chemistry\u2019 and explicates the significance of this by emphasising the \nprovisional (\u2018today\u2019), limited power (\u2018with some accuracy\u2019, \u2018limited predictive power\u2019), \nand restricted scope (\u2018a hundred pretty common diseases\u2019, \u2018very simple way\u2019) of the \n \nPage 2 \nuses of DNA to identify the propensity that a human being may have to develop one \nof a few known diseases.  And, after all, the same may be said of a number of \ndiagnostic medical tests that have been available longer than genetic analysis. Why, \nthen, should we dread the fact that others may have knowledge of \u2018our genes\u2019? One \nreason for concern about the use and retention of our genetic material by others lies \nin the very phrasing of Professor Bobrow\u2019s final summary remark that \u2018at the \nmoment, DNA has very limited predictive power\u2019.  \n \nIt is this image of a temporal dynamic, a trope built into the rhetoric of emerging \ngenetic technologies (and perhaps all technologies), that provides the engine for a \nrange of speculative fears about the informational power of DNA and suspicions that \nsuch information could be used \u2013 by state or private agents - against its providers in \nundesirable ways. Such concerns are not limited to DNA. They are regularly \nexpressed about a whole range of data, including biometric identifiers like \nfingerprints, which are routinely databased. The increased recording of personal \ninformation by the state and private enterprise has prompted the expression of a \nbroad set of concerns about privacy, liberty and autonomy, and the desire to limit or \nregulate the spread and uses of such archival practices. Yet the regular assertion of \nthe \u2018extra sensitive\u2019 informational nature of DNA, and thus the extra concerns that we \nshould have about it, mark a significant difference from most other concerns about \nthe collection of personal information. It is these concerns that were recently \ncaptured by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales\u2019 (2002) comment on the \n\u2018Pandora\u2019s box\u2019 quality of genetic research and its uses for the investigation of crime. \n \nResearching the UK National DNA Database \nThis paper draws on material collected as part of a larger project on police uses of \nthe UK National DNA Database (NDNAD). The approach we take to analysing the \ndeveloping uses of DNA and DNA databases in support of crime investigation is \n \nPage 3 \nsimilar to that of Hess\u2019 (1997) \u2018heterogeneous constructivism\u2019 insofar as we \nrecognise that scientific and technical innovations are both affected by particular \nsocial relations and at the same time, bring into being new forms of social relations. \nThe interrogation of the mutual determination of both technologies and the social \nnetworks within which they are realised is essential to understand the ways in which \nDNA profiling and databasing in the UK has moved from the \u2018local uncertainties\u2019 (Star \n1985) of their initial deployment within a small number of serious crime investigations \nto the \u2018global certainties\u2019 of their routine use for the investigation of volume crime.  \nIn the course of the larger project we try to capture this complexity by outlining some \nof the heterogeneous material, disciplinary and rhetorical resources that are brought  \ntogether in the forms of coordinated action that make up the NDNAD as a developing \nsocio-technical assemblage (see for example Johnson, Martin and Williams, 2003).  \n \nThe different knowledges, practices, and routines which together constitute the \nNDNAD have arisen and been developed within several distinct organizational \ncontexts, but they are each given new inflections through their combination and \noperational redeployment in the investigation of crime. In other words, separate \n\u2018specialist areas\u2019 \u2013 such as genomic sequencing, forensic science practice, \ninformation technology, police investigatory procedures, and governmental expertise \n\u2013 are combined in the form of the NDNAD to effect its construction and deployment in \ncertain ways and with specific aims. Therefore, of particular interest to us are the \nrelations that have come to exist between certain sets of actors within this complex of \nelements. The interests and resources of these actors are not just passively \ncombined, but rather rely upon and mutually reinforce each other in the course of the \nconstruction and continued development of the database and its deployment.  \n \nThe establishment and use of the NDNAD is a realization of a scientific potential \ndeveloped in accordance with specific state interests but which, because of its \n \nPage 4 \ninculcation with such interests, has itself prospered and grown in other contexts. \nWhilst it would be misleading to overstress the notion of a \u2018governmental drive\u2019 which \nsimply steers the development and implementation of such innovations, it is \nimpossible to expunge completely the political ambitions of the state from the \ndevelopment of this scientific technology; it is not simply that genetic profiling \u2018affords\u2019 \n(Hutchby, 2001) certain socio-political aims, but rather that those political aims have \nthemselves contributed to the establishment of this technology (outside, as well as \nwithin, forensic science \u2013 such as in the vast market of paternity testing.  \n \nIn the course of this work we have examined a large number of policy and \noperational documents produced by the Home Office and individual Police Forces.  \nWe have also collected documentary material from a number of other stakeholders \nincluding the Human Genetics Commission, the Information Commissioner and a \nvariety of pressure groups who have an interest in the state collection and use of a \nvariety of forms of genetic information.  In addition we have carried out more than 60 \nsemi-structured interviews with a range of individuals from organizations directly \ninvolved in either using, or commenting upon the use of, DNA profiling in the criminal \njustice system - the police, forensic scientists, crime scene examiners, legal \nprofessionals, legislators, and those concerned with human rights issues \u2013 with the \naim of providing a comprehensive \u2018map\u2019 of views relating to the use of DNA profiling \nby the police. Much of this material is currently subject to analysis, but even during \nour initial inspection of these data we were struck by the great number of different \ncommentaries which express \u2018concerns\u2019, \u2018worries\u2019 and \u2018fears\u2019 about the \u2018use of \ngenetic material\u2019 for the purposes of criminal investigations. Commentaries provided \nby individuals seem to employ a range of different representations of DNA, or deploy \nwhat Jasanoff (2001) describes as the varying \u2018identities\u2019 which are attributed to \nDNA, and in this paper we explore some of these in a preliminary way. Data are \n \nPage 5 \npresented in an anonymized form and we do not assert that the views expressed can \nbe exclusively aligned with particular occupational groups or to particular institutions.  \n \nHowever we will seek to show that different representations of DNA are employed to \nsupport alternative ethical assertions about the forensic uses of DNA and DNA \ndatabases. Many of the arguments about how, for example, the National DNA \nDatabase (NDNAD) should be governed, we argue, arise from differing \nunderstandings of the \u2018behaviour and potential\u2019 (Jasanoff, 2001) of DNA. With the \nrapid expansion of the ways in which DNA can be interrogated and manipulated by \nthe laboratory and informatic techniques of molecular biology, these representations \nbecome key rhetorical tokens. There is an essential tension throughout this \ndiscursive field between a wonderment of the ability of DNA to identify the \nperpetrators of crime and a dread about its capacities to erode civil liberties and \nhuman rights.   \n \nWe do not see these \u2018positions\u2019 as distinct and separate discourses which are \ndeployed independently of one another. On the contrary, we would argue that fears \nand concerns about civil liberties and human rights are imbricated with the \nestablished epistemic authority of molecular biology and the modes of its \nincorporation into the criminal justice system. This is concurrent with our view of the \nNDNAD as a socio-technical assemblage which, operating through a standardised \nset of scientific procedures, is accomplished through the negotiated actions of a \nvariety of innovators and users and, because of this, that the trajectory of such \ninnovations are marked by contestation, contingency and adaptation. We are \nconcerned to demonstrate in this paper that an essential feature of this contestation \nis the different ways in which specific actors comprehend and represent DNA \nprofiling and databasing technologies and, as a result, the types of ethical \nframeworks they offer for its use. In order to understand how different \n \nPage 6 \nrepresentations of DNA emerge it is therefore necessarily to situate them within the \nsocio-political context of an expanding NDNAD which now holds the DNA profiles of \nnot just those convicted of crimes but of a large number of innocent persons. In the \nnext section we discuss the recent history of these developments. \n  \nExpanding the database: success and concern \nThe tension between the desire to fully exploit the potential of DNA for the \ninvestigation of crime whilst recognising the issues of civil liberties raised by its use is \noften expressed in another rhetorical trope \u2013 of a balance between two alternative \ngoods: the effective use of DNA for the identification of offenders on one side; the \nprotection of individual rights to privacy on the other. A version of this balance has \nmost recently been expressed in a commentary by the Parliamentary Joint \nCommittee of Human Rights on the current Criminal Justice Bill 2003 that is before \nParliament as this paper is being written. An amendment tabled in this Bill proposes \nto extend the power of the police to take DNA samples from criminal suspects at the \npoint of arrest and, regardless of the outcome of that arrest, to retain the DNA \nsample (and the profile generated from it) indefinitely. Currently the police, under \npowers granted by the 2001 Criminal Justice and Police Act, are allowed to sample \nsuspects without consent only at the point that they are charged. The new measures \nwould enable the police to collect samples earlier, increasing the amount of \ndatabased material by approximately 300,000 individuals per year, and swell the size \nof a database which the government describe as comprising the \u2018active criminal \npopulation\u2019. In response to these proposals the Joint Committee on Human Rights \nstated that \u2018the carefully struck balance has been steadily shifted in favour of the \npolice\u2019 and that \u2018procedural safeguards have been progressively relaxed\u2019 (Joint \nCommittee on Human Rights, 2003). \n  \n \nPage 7 \nWhen the previous 2001 legislation was considered by Parliament there was only a \nsmall amount of media coverage which focused on the issues of privacy and liberty \nwhich it raised. Matters of privacy and discrimination, covered by Articles 8 and 14 \nrespectively in the European Convention on Human Rights, have been contended in \nthe High Court and the Court of Appeal (in the case of Marper & \u2018S\u2019 v Chief \nConstable of South Yorkshire). For some civil liberties commentators the 2001 \nlegislation can been seen to fundamentally alter the balance between the individual \nand the state by moving the line at which the right to privacy is drawn (this is the view \npublically expressed by, for example Statewatch). And Britain is in the curious \nposition of having the most far reaching legislative provision in the world for forensic \nDNA databasing whilst, unlike most other countries, being without explicitly \nformulated government assurances and charters regarding individual rights in the \ncontext of police DNA databasing. The new legislation, which affords the police the \npower to retain the DNA samples and profiles not only of those deemed innocent, but \nalso those never charged with a criminal offence, raises additional  ethical issues. \n \nIn fact, the concern to ensure that the use of DNA within the criminal justice system is \nbalanced and proportionate was apparent before the existence of the National DNA \nDatabase (NDNAD). Consideration of the ethical nature of taking samples from \nindividuals (with or without consent) and the presentation of that information as \nevidence in court was debated by, for instance, the Scottish Law Commission (1989). \nIt should also be remembered that the initial introduction of DNA into criminal \nproceedings was often received with great enthusiasm precisely because it was seen \nas a technology capable of ensuring a fair balance (between public interest and \nindividual liberty) in criminal investigation. In the 1993 Royal Commission on Criminal \nJustice the central feature of DNA profiling was noted to be its \u2018objective\u2019 capacity to \nprovide safe identifications, using high statistical levels of certainty, which could be \nused to exclude innocent people from criminal suspicion. This commission reported \n \nPage 8 \nat a time when public confidence in the criminal justice system was low and the use \nof the, then novel, technology of DNA profiling was viewed as a powerful tool in re-\nestablishing trust in the safety of criminal convictions based on forensic evidence. \nIndeed, the first application of this technology in the UK was used to eliminate a \nprime suspect who had confessed to crimes he had not committed, and subsequently \nto assist in the conviction of Colin Pitchfork for those murders.   \n \nThe Pitchfork case marked the introduction of this highly specialized scientific \ntechnology, developed by Alec Jeffreys and others in the mid 1980s, into selected \ncriminal investigations. What we have witnessed since then is the significant shift \nfrom the application of DNA profiling to individual casework targeted at serious crime \nto its routine use in volume investigation, incorporated into the daily practice of crime \nscene examiners, and its laboratory and informatic automation into a searchable and \nmatchable database technology. Thus, technological, political and policing changes \nhave enabled DNA profiling to become established as a central element of criminal \ninvestigation. The commitment to further this \u2018scientification of police work\u2019 (Ericson \nand Shearing, 1986) has been outlined in the recent Police Science & Technology \nStrategy 2003-2008 (Home Office, 2003b). We have outlined elsewhere (Johnson, \nMartin & Williams, 2003) the historical narrative of this process, its central features, \nand the ways in which governmental aims have been implemented in changing \npolicing practice.  \n \nWidening the scope for the police to collect DNA samples has served the central aim \nof expanding the collection of profiles contained on the NDNAD. With the ambition of \ncapturing a discrete population of \u2018active criminals\u2019, and placing them within a closed \ncircuit of surveillance (Williams & Johnson, 2003), the government\u2019s desire to expand \nthe operational capabilities of the database has been met. Increasing the volume of \nprofiles contained on the database has vastly amplified the chance of obtaining a \n \nPage 9 \nmatch between a crime scene sample and the profile of a databased suspect (figures \nprovided by the Forensic Science Service in their annual reports show that between \n1997\/8 and 2001\/2 the database had increased its matches from roughly 20,000 to \nnearly 60,000). Placed alongside several high profile cases, where DNA evidence \nhas contributed to the detection of serious offenders, the success of the NDNAD has \nbeen assured. Yet the expansion of the NDNAD has been undertaken at a time when \ngrowing public interest in the real and imagined potential of DNA has been \ncomplemented by increased expert commentaries and widening public awareness of \nthe ethical issues of DNA databasing and their governance (Martin and Kaye, 2000). \nCriticism is also regularly made that the government\u2019s legislative programme is \nseeking to establish a universal database \u2018by the back door\u2019 (a view expressed by \nmembers of Standing Committee F who debated the 2001 Criminal Justice and \nPolice Bill in the Commons). \n \nResponses to the expansion of the NDNAD clearly echo reactions to perceived \ndevelopments in DNA technology in general. Thus there is both excitement about its \npotential and fear regarding its use. Each step in the expansion of the database has \ntemporarily renewed debate about, and increased consciousness of, the ethical and \nsocial implications of the existence and uses of the NDNAD. However, there are \nsome central differences between the debates surrounding the use of DNA by the \npolice and those that arise in discussions of DNA databasing for medical purposes. \nFor the most part that is because of the differing circumstances under which DNA \nsamples are obtained (most notably in the way that they are \u2018given\u2019 from medical \n\u2018donors\u2019 but \u2018taken\u2019 from \u2018suspects\u2019) and used. These differences influence the ways \nin which the debates, about consent, privacy, and autonomy, are presented in the \ntwo contexts.  \n \nRepresenting DNA in ethical discourses \n \nPage 10 \nDebates about the essential \u2018nature\u2019 of DNA, and ethical concerns about its use, \nhave proliferated in  the context of the increased use of DNA by the police, and the \nextension of legislative provision to enable the expansion of the database through \nsampling the DNA of criminal suspects. These concerns are regularly expressed \nthrough questions about the types of information that is contained in DNA samples \nand profiles, the governance of any research based on these retained materials, and \nthe future uses to which they may be put. Whilst we discovered that there is a core of \ncentral ethical questions acknowledged by the key groups that we have talked to we \nhave also found that differing representations of DNA are employed in raising, \nconsidering and responding to the elements that make up this core. Using some \nexamples from documents and interviews with these stakeholders we outline below \nthree characteristic ways of representing DNA, and we show how these serve to \nenclose and shape ethical assertions about the legitimacy of a number of its forensic \nuses.  \n \nWe distinguish three such representations: first,  a \u2018genetic exceptionalism\u2019 which \nstresses the unique character of genetic material; second a \u2018genomic minimalism\u2019 \nwhich emphasises the mundane character of forensic uses of non-coding sequences \nof DNA; and third, a \u2018biometric pragmatism\u2019 which distinguishes between different \nsources of DNA material and what may legitimately be done with DNA obtained from \nthese sources. Each position asserts fundamentally different ontological images of \nthe \u2018essence\u2019 of DNA and uses these to legitimate claims that would either further, or \nlimit, the use of DNA and the NDNAD in support of criminal investigations.  \n \n \nI. genetic exceptionalism \nThe term genetic exceptionalism is already established in the bioethics literature. \nUsed by Murray (1997) and others, it places particular stress on the \u2018special \n \nPage 11 \ncharacter\u2019 of the information derivable from genetic material and therefore of the  \nnecessity to regulate carefully  its production, use, and dissemination in a range of \ncontexts including medical diagnosis and treatment, insurance and employment, as \nwell as its forensic applications. From this perspective, genetic material is seen as \nspecial not simply because of its seeming capacity to tell us so much about any \nindividual whose genome is interrogated, but also because of what that interrogation \nmay reveal about their blood relatives.  These possibilities \u2013 of exceptional \ninformation richness \u2013 it is argued, raise new kinds of questions about consent and \ninformation sharing amongst both users of genetic information and between \ngenetically related individuals.   \n \nA modulated version of this position recurs in considerations of forensic DNA \nanalysis and databasing. Whilst the issue of blood relatedness may be less \nprominent, the idea of the distinctively informative potential of genetic data \u2013 of DNA \nas a powerful biological catalogue of information - suggests the necessity of very \nparticular and perhaps equally powerful protocols to limit its collection and uses. \nSome limitations already exist but others are still in the process of development.  One \nimportant limit, which the UK government is currently unable to concede, is described \nin the Draft of the UNESCO Outline of the International Declaration on Human \nGenetic Data written by the International Bioethics Committee and currently in \ncirculation within the genetic research community.  The third article of this \nDeclaration asserts that human genetic data constitutes a special category of \ninformation of a scientific, medical and personal nature of lifelong relevance to the \nindividual, the family and the \u2018whole group\u2019 to which the person belongs. The \nDeclaration does not distinguish between different types of genetic information, the \ndifferent contexts of its application, or the principle of consent in different \ncircumstances. In the forensic context the document appears to assert the necessity \n \nPage 12 \nfor individualised judicial authority to be given for every instance of DNA sampling \u2013 \nincluding both crime scene stains and suspect sampling. \n \nEven if we assume that such protocols would have to be redrafted - in order to allow \nthe continued collection of DNA without consent for the legitimate purpose of criminal \ninvestigation - the exceptionalist position would maintain that the regulative \nframework appropriate for  the sampling, profiling, interrogating, retaining and using \ngenetic material raises problems for the police not previously encountered by their \ncollection, retention and use of less sensitive forms of forensic material (such as \nfingerprints). In fact, regulation and governance, one UK human rights group asserts, \nmay be a \u2018red-herring\u2019 because \u2018extremely sensitive personal data\u2019 will still be held on \na database. Unlike the collection and retention of fingerprints by the police, this group \nasserts that \u2018there\u2019s a great potential [to use DNA] which we consider to be quite \ndangerous\u2019: \n \nHuman Rights Group #1: An awful lot of things could be said to be \n[useful] for the prevention of crime. You know, say there was found \nto be a gene which predisposes people to criminality, somebody \ncould say in the future \u2018well, you know, you\u2019re allowed to pick up \nthose people\u2019 or \u2018we\u2019re allowed to sort of go through the database \nidentifying these people because it will help us prevent crime \nbecause then we will know which people it is that are likely to \ncommit crime\u2019 [\u2026] I\u2019m not saying that, you know, even in the future \nthe police would want to do that but if you are talking about \nlegislation where people\u2019s civil liberties and human rights are \nengaged you want to be very, very careful to limit the potentiality for \nlegislation and that doesn\u2019t seem to be done here. \n \n \nPage 13 \nThe potential for the legislation to allow the implementation of a future technological \ndevelopment in behavioural genetics that could isolate the \u2018criminal gene\u2019 and exploit \nthat genetic test for the purposes of criminal detection is a common concern. It is one \nof several possible future trends that, although seemingly extreme or unlikely, are \nregularly expressed. The position described above is not unique and fears about the \nretention and use of genetic material are shared by a variety of human rights groups \nin the UK and elsewhere. A member of another human rights organization, for \nexample, told us that concerns about the use of genetic material, as opposed to other \nbiometric identifiers, by the police are far greater because of the \u2018more powerful\u2019 \nnature of DNA: \n \nHuman Rights Group #2: If you have an identification [technology] \nlike iris recognition or whatever then you would only be using that in \nspecific places [\u2026] whereas something like DNA does give you the \npotential to follow people around and test glasses they\u2019ve been \ndrinking from, and also to identify other sensitive information, like if \nthey\u2019ve got a genetic disorder or if they\u2019ve got a child they didn\u2019t \nknow they had, so there is a slight expansion. I\u2019m not saying that the \nissues are totally new but I think there is a slight expansion of \nconcern. \n \nWhat characterises the positions of both of these respondents is that, although they \nexpress differing concerns, they focus on the special nature of DNA as a powerful \ninformation source that requires additional safeguards to prevent excessive or \nunauthorized use (these safeguards being necessary to prevent currently \nunknowable consequences). The first response expresses the dread that DNA could \nbe used to predict, not simply medical, but character disorders and to diagnose the \ntypes of \u2018dispositions\u2019 that we have. Of course such a technology could never be \n \nPage 14 \napplied to predict an individual disposition to crime if one subscribed to the view that \ncriminality is a social, not a biological, product (a view which most human rights \ngroups do subscribe to). Yet the concerns are not as far-fetched as they first appear. \nSeveral current governmental apparatuses, particularly those associated with \u2018risk \nmanagement\u2019 and crime, are directed to particular individuals to supposedly \ndiagnose their potential for offending. The point here is not that there \u2018really\u2019 could be \na criminal gene that could be isolated and known but that the idea of a genetically \npredisposed criminal could establish itself with enough rhetorical force and, \nlegitimated with the objectivity of \u2018science\u2019, produce dangerous recursive effects \n(Nazi Germany, or the worst practices of eugenics, are often cited as examples of \nthis). Viewed from this position DNA possesses an inherently dangerous capacity \nand the state\u2019s right to retain and use it should be limited. \n \nThe second response raises two issues: first, that DNA gives the police the power to \nincrease levels of surveillance; and second that the material can be used to derive \n\u2018sensitive\u2019 information about individuals. The concern that genetic material can be, \nlike some other biometric identifiers, collected covertly but that, unlike other \nbiometrics, be used to generate very sensitive personal information is not an \nuncommon view. The central idea here is that genetic samples constitute \u2018personal\u2019 \nmaterial and that the information taken from them is \u2018sensitive\u2019.  \n \nFor some it is the genetic sample, which the police take from criminal suspects, and \nnot the subsequent profile which is loaded onto the NDNAD, that generates the most \nserious set of concerns. Whilst genetic exceptionalists are no doubt uncomfortable \nwith the retention of genetic profiles it is the retention of bodily samples which attracts \nmost controversy. Yet, it is interesting to note that, from the perspective of the  \nInformation Commissioner (the organization which is responsible for overseeing the \nData Protection Act), what counts as personal information is not so straight forward. \n \nPage 15 \nFor the commission, the sample does not constitute personal data \u2013 indeed the \nsample does not constitute data at all; it is only the information derived from the \nsample that constitutes personal data.  \n \nSuch a nuanced construction of the \u2018personal\u2019 nature of DNA tells us something \nabout the representations of genetic material at the heart of these exceptionalist \narguments. Centrally, this is a position which stresses the informational potential \ninherent in the genetic substance itself, rather than simply the technologies which \nuse it or the contexts in which it is applied. Certainly those aspects are important but \nthe exceptionalist position stresses the special ethical concerns surrounding DNA \nbecause it points out the special, and importantly the unknown but potentially \nknowable, qualities of genetic material. Some commentators see a flaw in this \nposition, whilst sharing some of the concerns which arise from it. One university-\nbased ethicist told us: \n \nI suppose I think of [DNA] as more powerful information, even \nthough I know some of that\u2019s the hype and not the actual reality [\u2026] \nI don\u2019t think the hype is the media, I think the problem is that the \nhype is often the researchers because they see something like the \ngene for aggression [and] if you read the articles in things like \nNature you find that they refer to the homosexuality gene, the \naggression gene, in the actual reports, it\u2019s not just the media hype \n[\u2026] You know, I don\u2019t think the public are stupid and that they latch \nonto it wrongly, I think it\u2019s the way it\u2019s reported and this idea of \ngenes for behaviour I am worried about. \n \nHowever, not all exceptionalist views rely on what is designated here as \u2018hype\u2019; the \nconcerns expressed by some civil liberty groups are legitimate fears about individual \n \nPage 16 \nprivacy and autonomy in the face of state power. But the basis of these concerns is \noften more general fears about the use of information by the state rather than the real \nor actual properties inherent to DNA. As Martin Richards (Richards, 1999) argues, \nthe genetic exceptionalist case often reiterates general concerns about civil liberties \nwhich are no different from those made in other contexts. The concern should not, \nRichards argues, be about the special \u2018nature\u2019 of genetic material but about the \ngeneral balance of our right to withhold any information about ourselves from the \nstate and to limit the use to which information, once provided, is being put. This \nbalance, in principle, does not require any exceptional concern about genetic \nmaterial as such.  \n \nII. genomic minimalism \nIn a recent discussion with civil servants whose work is focused on the criminal \njustice system, we expressed an interest in the shifting balance between individual \nprivacy and autonomy and the right of the state to hold genetic information without \nconsent. In stark contrast to the types of representations used by human rights \ngroups, these individuals, as one might expect, had a different way of talking about, \nand representing, DNA. In this particular case they used a visual representation in \nthe form of a string of numbers written down on a piece of paper. This, they \nexplained, was a \u2018genetic profile\u2019 and, as we could see by simple inspection, it \n\u2018contained no sensitive information about an individual\u2019. Such a formulation in which \na genetic profile is reduced to a set of numbers (signifying no more than is signified \nby a car number plate, as it was described in this context) constitutes what we refer \nto here as genomic minimalism. This perspective emphasises the very limited \ninformational capacity of the loci normally used for forensic identifications and, \ntherefore the consequent uninformativeness of the retained profile (an analogy to \nfingerprints is often made).  \n \n \nPage 17 \nThis sense of informational sparsity is reinforced by the use of the term \u2018junk DNA\u2019 to \ndescribe the regions of DNA which are sequenced during STR profiling. The \nsubsequent genetic profile, it is argued, is much like a barcode in that it contains very \nlittle information other than its capacity to uniquely identify an individual. In the United \nStates it is conventional for proponents of CODIS, the national system used to \nsearch for DNA matches across state collections, to remind us that their choice of \nspecific STR markers was made precisely because they were originally thought not \nto code for any known matter of medical or phenotypic relevance. This again \nstresses the importance of this specific way of profiling which uses \u2018uninterpreted \nDNA\u2019 or \u2018uninformative DNA\u2019. Sometimes the central term for describing the DNA \nprofile becomes the even less suggestive term \u2018STR marker\u2019. During a recent \npresentation of our research, to a group made up largely of those working in bio-\nmedicine, we encountered this view a number of times: one person told us \u2018I couldn\u2019t \ncare less who has my STR\u2019s\u2019 and another said \u2018having my STR markers is no more \nthan having my photograph\u2019. If the genetic profile made up of such STR markers is \nnot considered to be data rich then it can be deemed to be akin to any other \nbiometric identificatory source collected, held and searched by the police.  \n \nThese minimalist positions express a view of genetic profiling which reduces the \ninformation capacity of the profile to a mundane identifier \u2013 an empty signifier. This \ndoes not mean that one could not be fundamentally concerned about matters of \nprivacy and liberty from a minimalist position \u2013 after all, turning the body into a \nbarcode and recording it may constitute a breach of privacy \u2013 but the emphasis here \nis on the essentially mundane nature of DNA as opposed to its special qualities. \nDescribing DNA in this way allows for the NDNAD to be presented in a number of \ndifferent forms. Most obviously it can be presented as an identity register, akin to our \ncurrent system of registering births and deaths, but one which is far more reliable. \nThere may still remain the question of who should be on this register, and who may \n \nPage 18 \nhave access to it and for what purpose, but the material on the register is not viewed \nas requiring special concern. Such genomic minimalism is therefore often employed \nto encourage trust in some aspects of the forensic uses of DNA because there is less \nneed to worry about data which is limited in its information capacity.  \n \nGenomic minimalism often prefigures debates about privacy concerns by serving to \nreduce or negate their legitimacy. This can be seen in the view propounded by the \ncurrent Home Secretary when he asserts that \u2018there is nothing to fear from our own \nidentity being properly acknowledged and recognised\u2019 (Guardian, July 3rd 2002). In \nthe Home Secretary\u2019s view the recording of our identity \u2013 whether it be in the form of \na DNA profile or an identity card \u2013 does not violate our privacy because it is simply a \nrecord of our existence. Even where privacy may seem to be breached by the \nretention of genetic profiles of the innocent, as for example in the recent ruling by the \nLord Chief Justice mentioned above (2002) this invasion is described as \u2018modest\u2019 \nand justified as proportionate in relation to the broader social benefits it allows. This \nidea of a \u2018modest invasion\u2019 of privacy is fundamentally linked to a representation of \nDNA which stresses minimalist concerns. When this \u2018modest\u2019 invasion is considered \nin relation to the spectacular success stories of the NDNAD the government are able \nto present the forensic use of DNA as a low risk-high benefit solution to criminal \ndetection. Indeed, one of the arguments forwarded by government is that the use of a \nNDNAD can offer a non-invasive form of policing and that \u2018usual suspects\u2019 benefit \nfrom having their DNA retained so that they can be eliminated from suspicion \n\u2018remotely\u2019. This, it may be said, increases autonomy and privacy rather than \ndiminishing it.  \n \nMinimalist views of DNA are deployed by those who argue for the extension of the \ndatabase to the whole population. It is also a view that has been expressed in a \nrecent meeting of members of the Human Genetics Commission on the grounds that \n \nPage 19 \n\u2018the establishment of a universal database of this kind would serve to solve the \ndiscrimination inherent in the current situation\u2019. Solving discrimination created by the \ndatabase (between those \u2018groups\u2019 who are on the database and those who are not) \nwith an appeal to the establishment of a universal database relies, in this case, on \nthe idea that the database itself does not contain information of a highly sensitive \nnature. And often these arguments are tied to other ideas about the social benefits of \ndatabase expansion \u2013 for instance, the potential for the identification of otherwise \nunidentified victims of homicide or major accidents where identity could not otherwise \nbe determined.  \n \nHowever, not all minimalists are universalists. In a recent paper on DNA, Etzioni \n(2001) discusses what he regards as the minimally intrusive character of forensic \nDNA profiling and commends legislative changes in the United States which would \npermit the routine collection of DNA from criminal suspects. Arguing that there are \nlegal mechanisms which serve to constitute an individual as a suspect (he includes \nboth arrest and stop and search processes), he suggests that this categorisation is \nsufficient to licence the diminution of the right to privacy that is appropriate to the \n\u2018innocent-innocent\u2019 citizen.  He also argues that the results of these tests should be \nretained for a certain period of time in cases when no conviction follows and then be \nexpunged or \u2018sequestered\u2019.  But crucially he argues that to collect DNA, other than \nthrough mass screenings, from all citizens would be to treat them as if were \nsuspects. Something, he argues, which would result in public opposition. \n \n \n \nIII biometric pragmatism  \nForensic work comprises the collection and analysis of physical materials found at \nscenes of crime. In UK law, bodily fluids and tissues left at a crime scene have the \n \nPage 20 \nlegal status of abandoned property and can therefore be legitimately seized by the \npolice for analysis and use in support of crime investigations. The collection of such \nmaterials is a routine and mundane part of the work of scene examiners. Thinking \nabout the collection of DNA in this way, as the gathering of abandoned material that \ncould be found at any scene of crime, is the starting point of a third perspective that \nwe are encountering during our current research and which we term \u2018biometric \npragmatism\u2019. This perspective characterizes DNA as an especially powerful biometric \nidentifier but treats it, and the issues which its use raises, in common with all such \nidentifiers found at crime scenes. The difference which separates this perspective \nfrom the two outlined above is that it combines an acknowledgement that DNA can \nenable the generation of rich information without the necessity to classify that \ninformation as requiring unique ethical treatment.  \n \nThis approach is often taken by investigators, some criminal prosecutors, and some \nacademic commentators on forensic identification.  It begins by asserting the \nnecessity to distinguish between the different practical circumstances under which \ngenetic material may be collected, interrogated, stored and subsequently used in the \ncriminal justice process. It recognises the potentially informative nature of DNA and it \nseeks to exploit this fully on a case-by-case basis for the purposes of criminal \ninvestigation. It argues that the restriction of DNA criminal databases to the \nsequencing of genetically uninformative loci is appropriate since the technique \npreserves as much information as required for crime investigation, but it distinguishes \nbetween the potential for crime scene DNA analysis and the construction of forensic \nDNA databases. It is therefore neither minimalist nor exceptionalist but stresses a \npragmatic perspective about the legitimate contexts and arrangements for the use of \nDNA by the police. \n \n \nPage 21 \nThe central element of this pragmatic approach is the distinction drawn between the \ndifferent contexts of crime scene examination and databasing.  DNA analysis of \ncrime scene stains, legally obtained through appropriate search and seizure \nprotocols, need not, it is argued, be subjected to ethical constraints that differ from \nthose that govern criminal investigations in general. The DNA analysis that is \nundertaken is no different from any other kind of forensic analysis that is applied to \ncrime scene material. Certainly the donor of this material can claim no ownership \nrights or claim an invasion of privacy. It is stressed that the initial analysis of all such \ncrime scene stains is carried out using probes that collect information only about the \ndatabase STR markers (the uninterpreted segments of DNA) and, if a crime scene \nprofile matches a database profile, no further molecular interrogation would be \nnecessary \u2013 a minimalist assertion. However if the DNA profile does not match on \nthe database then further interrogation of the scene stain should be allowable. The \ntechniques for allowing this further interrogation are limited but research is underway \nto develop them \u2013 exceptionalism is recognised, but as a resource rather than a \nrestraint.  \n \nFrom this pragmatic position the concerns of exceptionalists need not be applied to \nthe analysis and the exploitation of the informational capacity of crime scene \nsamples. Nor can the willingness to collect and interrogate such rich DNA sources be \nunderstood as part of a minimalist position. The minimalist position often ignores \nresearch currently underway to increase investigators\u2019 ability to exploit DNA for the \nsort of information which exceptionalists deem to be of special significance. Indeed, \none outcome of this ongoing process is the Forensic Science Service (FSS) \ncommitment to further develop technologies aimed at defining the \u2018commonplace \ncharacteristics\u2019 of individuals from genetic samples. Identifying \u2018commonplace \ncharacteristics\u2019, it can be argued, provides important information that allows the \npolice to target a particular pool of suspects. Currently two services are offered to the \n \nPage 22 \npolice by the FSS to analyze samples collected from crime scenes which do not \nsubsequently match any profile on the database. The FSS offer a \u2018red hair test\u2019, \nwhich looks at differences in the coding regions of genes that influence physical \ncharacteristics, and an \u2018ethnic inference service\u2019, which uses the differences found in \nSTR markers across the whole population to infer from the profile the ethnicity of the \nindividual from which the sample came. Leaving aside the inherently problematic \nnature of such an inference \u2013 after all, ethnic \u2018categories\u2019 arise as mundane social \npractices of designating differences amongst people on the basis of ordinary visual \ndistinctions (and thus relying upon, and reiterating, all sorts of nuances and subtleties \nwhich are less than scientifically objective) \u2013 this service does, regardless of its \naccuracy, explicitly seek to exploit a data-rich information source. How, then, can this \nbe justified in a minimalist way as an activity which does not constitute a breach of \nprivacy or exploit sensitive information?  \n \nWe put this question to two research subjects, both of who are civil servants involved \nin the development and expansion of the database. During the interviews we \nconducted with them they were keen to present genetic information as data sparse \nand thus dispute the exceptionalist concerns expressed by human rights \norganizations. However, a different representation emerges here: \n \n#1: You\u2019re talking about being able to identify from a sample [\u2026] for \ninstance facial characteristics, and things to do with gender and \nethnicity in general, but anything else that goes with it. Well, again, \nisn\u2019t that helpful, useful in terms of the investigation of crime? You \nknow, to be able to go to\u2026you lift a crime stain, there\u2019s no match on \nthe database, but you can tell the police \u2018well, you know, the \nprobability is that it was somebody, you know, a male, six foot six, \n \nPage 23 \nwith red hair and green eyes\u2019. You know, it sort of narrows the field \ndown. \n \n#2: It\u2019s much better than what we used to have in the past where \npeople would give you a description and it may not be that person \n[\u2026] where this will provide some useful information and [\u2026] it\u2019s only \nfor intelligence, you have the legislative clause that says it can only \nbe used for the investigation and prosecution of a criminal offence. \n \nWhat is interesting about this account is how DNA shifts from being represented as a \nnumber plate or bar code to become as a highly data-rich molecular substance. \nEffectively it becomes re-presented in a manner in accord with the exceptionalist \nposition. Yet the emphasis here is on the legitimate and justified use of DNA within \nspecific contexts and, crucially, within the parameters of legislation which ensures \nthat its use is regulated and confined to the investigation of crime: it is \u2018only for \nintelligence\u2019. The purpose to which genetic material is put, and the way in which it \nwas obtained, does inevitably allow for these claims to be made. A DNA sample \nobtained for fluid or tissue left at a crime scene is unlikely to be deemed worthy of \nprotection under any appeal to the privacy of personal information. This is central to \nthe pragmatic argument and it poses a serious problem to those who hold \nexceptionalist views and would argue for limits on the analysis of all genetic material. \nThe pragmatic view stresses the mundane and routine aspects of police \ninvestigations and the need to exploit any available crime scene source for \nintelligence. With the aim of detecting an offender how is it possible to argue against \nthe use of DNA for such a cause? \n \nThis question, and the examples provided above, show the ways in which the \nrepresentations that we have discussed are inevitably implicated within, and reflect, \n \nPage 24 \ndiffering socio-political attitudes to crime and policing. For instance, genetic \nexceptionalist representations of DNA are often brought into play to question the \nlegitimacy of the expansion of the database to store the samples and profiles of the \nunconvicted. However, we can find no evidence to suggest that human rights groups, \nor others who take an exceptionalist position, dispute the right of the police to hold \nthe samples and profiles of those convicted of an offence \u2013 that use of DNA, it \nseems, is agreed to be in accordance with the \u2018balance\u2019 of civil security and individual \nfreedoms. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that exceptionalism is used to \nargue in principle against any kind of genetic profiling (including the interrogation of \n\u2018coding regions\u2019) of crime scenes stains. In fact in relation to DNA samples recovered \nfrom crime scenes there is a convergence of opinion regarding the use of just these \npotentially information rich properties in support of criminal investigations. It is \nnoticeable then that the pragmatic position serves to accommodate both the \nexceptionalist and minimalist positions in relation to those uses of molecular biology \nwhich focus directly on criminal actions and indirectly on unambiguously criminalised \nidentities.   \n    \nConclusion: future possibilities and pragmatic solutions \nThe positions that we have outlined above are continually implicated in, and are \nactively configuring, debates about the present use and future development of the \nNDNAD. Different representations of DNA are employed to make arguments about \nhow best to manage, govern, and regulate DNA databases in the UK and elsewhere. \nIt is clear that representations arise out of social and political considerations about \nthe particular categories of persons, such as \u2018criminal\u2019 and \u2018innocent\u2019 individuals, that \nare implicated in this management. And it is also apparent that, in relation to those \nindividuals and the particular aims of either protecting or detecting them, \nrepresentations and arguments sometimes change.  \n \n \nPage 25 \nSometimes these representations are configured in surprising ways. For instance, as \npart of the widening debate about the universalisation of the NDNAD Alec Jeffreys \nannounced to the 2001 annual conference of the British Association that a universal \ndatabase would be a more ethical way of databasing DNA. Jeffreys sees the solution \nto concerns about discrimination and privacy in the establishment of an expanded \npopulation database. The exceptionalist view on expansion typically stresses its \ndangers because of the potential for such a wide database to become misused, but \nJeffreys\u2019 vision is one which imagines a universal database governed by an \nindependent public body and where access, by the police or other state agencies, is \nadministered through judicial control. This would not allay the fears of those \nexceptionalists who favour curtailing the right of the state to retain genetic information \nin the first place. For them the ability to gain any information (such as phenotypic \ncharacteristics, or the ability to make ethnic inference) means that any allowed \nretention should be strictly delimited.  \n \nIf the main ethical concerns about the retention of human tissue, by the FSS and \nother forensic laboratories, is their capacity to carry out research on those samples \nthen practical questions about what types of research will be undertaken in the future \nare important. Genetic research using current forensic databases is, we would \nsuggest, unlikely. Besides the FSS having a very low research budget (\u00a33.7Million in \n2001-2002),  the growth of offshoots from the human genome project and the rapid \nexpansion of bioinformatic  research elsewhere dwarf the capacity of the research \ncapacity of the FSS and its limited database. Any developments in genetic research \nwhich are important for forensic use are bound to arise elsewhere in the genetics \ncommunity. Yet even if developmental research by the FSS furthers the predictive \ncapacities of DNA analysis the results are unlikely to be integrated into a forensic \ndatabase of suspect samples. Such predictive capacities remain irrelevant to the vast \nmajority of criminal investigations in which current STR sequencing is sufficient for \n \nPage 26 \nestablishing identification of suspects through the use of the NDNAD. Predicting \nphenotypic characteristics of people currently on the database is made redundant by \nthe fact of their inclusion in the first place. Full STR profiles, generated from crime \nscene samples, will match those profiles on the database without further analysis and \nrecently in the UK, even partial matches are increasingly being used to provide lists \nof individuals who may be genetically related to criminal suspects. When no STR \nmatch can be made between a NDNAD profile and a crime scene sample profile, \nthen other information derivable from the database would be of no help. It is for this \nreason that forensic DNA databases are likely to remain genomically minimalist in \ncharacter unless the technology platforms for their construction are changed for \nreasons of expense. \n  \nHowever, it can be argued that even this genomic minimalism needs to be assured \nby an external governing agency or independent body. Further, that the case can \nalso be made for the destruction of genetic samples once satisfactory profiling has \nbeen accomplished. For the human rights groups we talked to in the course of the \nstudy, this destruction\/retention combination is highly desirable. In several European \ncountries (for example, Belgium and Germany) different criteria are applied to the \nretention of samples and profiles with Britain being unique in having the blanket \nprovision to retain both indefinitely. The benefits of retaining samples, it can be \nargued, is threefold: samples can be used in quality assurance programmes; they \ncan enable future challenges to errors in the original DNA profiling; and, importantly, \nthey can allow re-profiling in the event of scientific advances. If the retention of \nsamples is deemed to be of crucial significance then, from an exceptionalist position, \nsamples themselves should be separated and stored by an independent authority \nwhere access to them is limited. \n \n \nPage 27 \nThe NDNAD, we suggest, will inevitably remain minimalist in its construction since \nthe storage of individual genetic information by the police, other than as the current \nkind of STR markers, is largely irrelevant to the investigation and detection of crime. \nYet, what will remain problematic, under the current legislative provision, are the \ncontested  principles of privacy and discrimination which inevitably arise from the \nexpansion of the database to include the unconvicted. The extension of powers \nproposed by the Criminal Justice Bill 2003 will deepen that problem since the \ndatabase will significantly be increased by the profiles of those never charged with \nany recordable offence. The solution to this problem, we would suggest, is not to be \nfound in either the exceptionalist or minimalist position, but with a pragmatic \napproach. With appropriate regulation of research on genetic samples, and with \nadequate provision for police access to speculative searching of STR profiles, the \ndatabase could satisfy those with both exceptionalist and minimalist concerns. This \napproach would follow a pragmatic approach to the existence and use of an \nestablished database but recognize that the legislative and governing framework \nneeds considerable revision. However, one solution to the problems inherent in the \ncurrent provision for the database, with its limited scope for STR matching and the \notherwise inevitable need to develop further research to analyze crime scene \nmaterial, would be the construction of a population database. Such a database could \nbe minimalist in the information it stored and, because it would produce automatic \nmatches between crime scene and databased profiles, effectively end the need for \nfurther research on gene sequencing in forensic contexts. How long will it be before \nthe government argue that the only way to protect our genetic privacy is to construct \na universal database in this way?   \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 28 \nBibliography \n \nCourt of Appeal (Civil Division) (2002) The Queen on the Application of Marper and \nAnother and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire before the Chief Justice \nof England and Wales. \nEricson, R.
