Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n2 \nI. Introduction \nArable agriculture is considered to be a major contributor to diffuse nitrogen, \nphosphorus and carbon pollution.  Mitigation of diffuse pollution is an important part \nof the Water Framework Directive but there is a conflict between pollutants.  Pollution \nswapping occurs when a mitigation option or best management practice (BMP) is \nintroduced to reduce loss of one pollutant, but in doing so inadvertently leads to an \nincrease in another pollutant; in effect, one pollutant is \u2018swapped\u2019 for another.  \nAlthough pollution swapping has been recognised for a number of years, there have \nbeen very few attempts to draw together information on the potential for pollution \nswapping across a range of diffuse pollution mitigation options in agricultural systems.   \nThis study focuses on agricultural systems, specifically on combinable crops.  A \nwide range of BMPs are available to farmers to control diffuse pollution from such \ncrops.  Indeed, incentive scheme legislation, such as the Entry Level Stewardship \nscheme (ELS), encourages or requires farmers to adopt BMPs in order to reduce losses \nof one or more pollutants. However, little thought is given to the impact of BMPs on \nlosses of other pollutants.  This study presents the results of an extensive literature \nreview on a variety of BMPs and pollutants.  The review is not intended to be \nexhaustive, but to highlight trends in published data and to demonstrate the effect of \nmitigation options on different pollutants. \nThe mitigation options that have been investigated in this study are: cover \ncrops, residue management, no-tillage, riparian buffer zones, contour grass strips and \nconstructed wetlands.  These were chosen because they are widely promoted as being \nuseful for controlling diffuse pollution (e.g. 26, 38, 91, 107, 171, 125).  A variety of \nwater and atmospheric pollutants with a wide range of environmental, economic and \nhealth effects were considered (table 1). \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n3 \n \nII. Cover crops \n \nCover crops (also called catch crops) are used in agricultural systems \nthroughout the world to reduce losses of nutrients through leaching and to protect the \nsoil surface from erosion.  Other potential benefits of cover crops have been suggested, \nincluding weed suppression, carbon sequestration, integrated pest management (38), \nthe provision of a source of forage in integrated farming systems (143), fixation of \nnitrogen, improvement of soil structure and reduced surface sealing of the soil (154).  \nThere is also evidence that cover crops have an effect on evaporation and infiltration \nprocesses because of different patterns of surface cover and crop growth through the \nseason, compared to a conventional crop system (167).   \nThe use of cover crops dates back to ancient agriculture.  However, it was not \nuntil between 1930 and 1945 that the role of cover crops in reducing nitrate leaching \nwas first studied (104).  This has since become the primary function of cover crops in \nmodern European agriculture.  In 1991 the EC Nitrates Directive was passed, which \nrequired all member states to establish nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs).  Within these \nareas there is a requirement to establish codes of good agricultural practice that aim to \nminimise nitrate (NO3) leaching in order to safeguard drinking water supplies and \nprevent eutrophication.  The Directive suggests that cover crops should be considered \nas a good agricultural practice where land would otherwise be left bare.  In addition, \nlocal measures have been taken to encourage the use of cover crops in some countries: \nfor example, the Swedish Parliament has passed a resolution requiring at least 50% of \narable land in the south of Sweden to have a winter cover crop (187). \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n4 \nCover crops are generally sown either in autumn, immediately following \nharvest, or in the spring, when they are under-sown below the crop.  Cover crops can \nthen be incorporated into the soil ready for the next season\u2019s crop to be sown.  A wide \nvariety of species, including both legumes and non-legumes can be sown as cover \ncrops.  The major non-leguminous species used in temperate climates are grasses, \nparticularly rye grass (Lolium perenne).  Among leguminous species, clover (Trifolium \nsp.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) are commonly used.  Leguminous species offer the \nadvantage of fixing atmospheric nitrogen in the soil and potentially providing \nadditional nitrogen for the following crop.   \nMost of the recent research into the effectiveness of cover crops for reducing \npollution has focussed on NO3 leaching.  Cover crops reduce NO3 leaching by \nintercepting nitrogen that would otherwise be lost from the plant\u2013soil system.  During \nthe winter, when the ground is bare and evaporation is low, there is a greater potential \nfor water to move through the soil profile.  With no crop to take it up the mineralized \nnitrogen can be leached from the soil.  Cover crops return this mineralized nitrogen to \nthe organic pool, thus reducing leaching losses. \nReductions in NO3 leaching with cover crops compared to bare fallow have \nbeen widely reported in the literature (e.g.193, 184, 156), although results are very \nmixed.  A review of the literature shows reductions in NO3 leaching ranging from 0 to \n98%, with an average annual reduction of 48% (figure 1).  This variation in study \nresults is due to differences in soil textures, crop rotation, cover crop species, rainfall \nduring the sampling season, cover crop success rate, fertiliser rate, planting date and \nwhether the cover crop was incorporated into the soil. \nRitter et al. (143) were not able to identify any significant reduction in NO3 \nleaching from cover crops.  Their study was conducted on loamy sand soils in \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n5 \nDelaware, USA with a rye cover crop and irrigated corn.  Ritter et al. (143) identify the \nimportance of planting date and weather conditions in ensuring a good cover crop \ngrowth and optimum nitrogen uptake. They point out that cover crops do not fit easily \ninto some crop rotations and it may not be possible to establish good crop cover early \nenough in the year to prevent NO3 leaching.  Measurements taken over eight years at \nGleadthorpe Research Station, Nottinghamshire, UK, Shepherd (156) reported variable \nsuccess of cover crops. Cover crops were found least effective when drainage started \nearly, allowing NO3 to leach before the cover crop was established. \nLong-term frequent use of cover crops can lead to an increase in mineralizable \nnitrogen in the soil.  Aronson and Torstensson (7) report the results of a seven-year \nstudy conducted on sandy loam soils in the south of Sweden.  During most of the \nexperimental period significantly less NO3 was leached from catch crop treatment than \nfrom bare fallow.  However, towards the end of the experiment a poorly developed \ncatch crop showed significantly higher NO3 leaching.  This demonstrates that if catch \ncrops are no longer used or fail, there is potential for enhanced NO3 leaching. \nLeaching is not the only route by which NO3 can potentially be lost from cover \ncrop systems.  Overland flow provides a second route which is strongly influenced by \ncrop cover.  Increased infiltration and evapotranspiration have the potential to reduce \nthe volume of overland flow, but despite this the NO3 concentration in the overland \nflow may increase.  In a review of the impacts of cover crops on surface water runoff, \nSharpley and Smith (152) identify both increases and decreases in the NO3 \nconcentration of runoff, which they attribute to differing climatic, soil and crop factors.  \nNO3 concentration in runoff ranged from an increase of 31% with cover crops as \nopposed to bare fallow, to a reduction of 87% with cover crops.  Sharpley and Smith \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n6 \n(152) emphasise the need for flexible management solutions that can account for site-\nspecific factors.  \nNitrogen can also be lost from soils as the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O).  \nThe effect of cover crops on N2O emissions has received little research attention.  \nVinther et al. (193) were not able to identify any significant differences in N2O \nemissions between four different crop rotations (some including cover crops) on clay \nsoils in Denmark.  The N2O emission was spatially variable and depended on current \nand previous land use.  Some authors have suggested it is possible that cover crops \ncould reduce emissions by reducing the mineral nitrogen accumulated in the soil (40). \nCover crops have traditionally been grown to protect the soil from erosion, and \nthey continue to be used to reduce soil and sediment losses.  They reduce runoff \nvolumes by encouraging infiltration, and minimise the area of soil surface exposed to \nraindrop impact, thereby reducing splash erosion and detachment.  Cover crops can \nalso reduce the velocity of overland flow, with the result that it can detach and transport \nless sediment (38). \nKlienman et al. (81) investigated the use of a simultaneous corn and cover crop \nsystem on loamy soils in New York.  They found significantly less runoff and reduced \nsuspended solids with cover crops than with the control treatment of corn alone.  \nFollowing the application of dairy manure (50 kg total P ha-1), suspended solids in \nrunoff were measured.    After one day the amount of suspended solids in runoff was \nreduced by an average of 65% with a rye cover crop and 76% with a clover cover crop, \ncompared with the corn only control plots.  When manure was applied at a higher rate \n(100 kg total P ha-1) the reductions were not as great, but they were still apparent: \nsuspended solids were reduced by 33% for rye and 7.3% for clover.  These reductions \nwere hypothesised to be due to less ground cover in the control plots. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n7 \nLangdale et al. (88) reviewed the use of cover crops for reducing soil losses and \nfound significant reductions in erosion.  In field trials, cover crops have reduced soil \nloss by 7\u201387%, with an average reduction of 52% (figure 1).   As for NO3, the range of \nvalues presented here are affected by soil textures, crop rotation, cover crop species, \nrainfall during the sampling season and cover crop success rate. \nAs a considerable fraction of phosphorus (P) lost from combinable crop fields is \nlost as particulate P, there is scope for cover crops to reduce P pollution.  In a \nlaboratory experiment on loamy soils, Bechmann et al. (13) found that total P (TP) \nconcentrations in runoff from soils planted with a rye grass cover crop were reduced by \n75% compared with bare and manured soil.  TP was strongly correlated with the \nsuspended solids in the bare and manured soils, indicating that the majority of the P lost \nwas bound to sediments.  P is also lost dissolved in surface waters or in leachate, which \nis not as effectively reduced (and may even increase) with cover crops.  \nSharpley and Smith (154) reviewed studies investigating a range of cover crops \nand cropping systems.  They found that a majority of studies showed reductions in the \nTP concentration of runoff.  Working on a wheat crop system on clay loam soils with \nryegrass as a catch crop, Ul\u00e9n (187) also reported large reductions in TP in runoff (up \nto 94% in some plots) with a cover crop, compared to bare fallow, although on average \nparticulate P was not reduced by cover crops, but showed similar concentrations to \ncontrol plots.  Staver and Brinsfield (167) reported a reduction in total P concentration \nin runoff by 44% in a conventionally tilled corn system on silty soils in Maryland.  In a \nno-till system this was increased to 63%.  They found that only a small percentage of \nthe P lost from crops was lost in overland flow; this, however, would appear to be in \ncontrast to many cover crop P studies.  PO4-P was significantly higher in runoff from \nexperimental plots with a cover crop than from those with bare ground (187, 154).   \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n8 \nIn a wheat cropping system in Texas, Sharpley et al. (151) found that a sorghum \ncover crop reduced soil loss and associated particulate phosphorus, but dissolved and \nbioavailable phosphorus were greater with a cover crop.  They speculated that this \nmight be due to the contribution of P from vegetative material, which can potentially be \nan important source in runoff.  Sharpley (153) found that in the absence of fertiliser \napplication, up to 90% of soluble P found in runoff can be from cover crops.  This can \nbe especially important when cells are lysed by freezing and thawing, or by senescence.  \nFurthermore, by reducing erosion there may be an increase in the surface P status of the \nsoil (151), particularly in no-till systems (section IV). \nOther pollutants have received little or no attention with regard to cover crops.  \nVinter et al. (193) found no difference in CO2 emissions between cover cropped \nsystems and bare fallow.  Other gaseous pollutants such as methane and hydrogen \nsulphide have not been investigated; however, as cover crops do not cause \nwaterlogging of the soil there is unlikely to be any effect.  It has been suggested that \ncover crops provide an opportunity to sequester carbon in the soil (38), as they increase \nthe soil carbon content through the incorporation of the cover crop.  There is also the \npotential for cover crops to increase the dissolved carbon organic content of runoff \nowing to greater microbial activity, and this area deserves some research effort.  \nSimilarly, the impact of cover crops on pesticide pollution has received very little \nattention, although the potential for reduction in overland flow with cover crops could \nreduce the mass of pesticide transported. \n \nCover crops \u2013 Summary (figure 1) \n\u2022 Cover crops generally reduce NO3 leaching when they are successfully \nestablished, although long-term use may lead to a flush of NO3 when cover \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n9 \ncropping is ceased.  NO3 in overland flow may be increased or decreased.  \nThere are no changes apparent in N2O emissions. \n\u2022 Cover crops generally reduce soil losses, as compared to bare fallow. \n\u2022 Losses of particulate P are generally reduced in runoff, but losses of \ndissolved reactive P may be increased by cover crops.  This form of P is \nbiologically available. \n\u2022 There is no difference in CO2 emissions between cover crops and bare \nfallow. \n \nIII. Crop residues \n \nCrop residues are either removed or left on the soil surface.  Retained residues \ncan be used as mulch and to control wind (e.g. 109) and water erosion.  Residues which \nare incorporated into the soil improve soil condition and infiltration, but they are less \neffective at reducing erosion than residues left on the soil surface (107).  Residues left \non the soil surface protect the surface from sealing and crusting, so increasing the \npotential for infiltration; they also increase surface roughness and create small \ndiversions and retention reservoirs, slowing runoff velocity.  Working on a clay loam \nsoil, Myers and Wagger (120) did not find any increase in infiltration with residues but \nthey did find significant reductions in the amount of sediment in overland flow.  This \ncould be due to reduced splash erosion (32, 107, 150) or a reduction in the velocity of \noverland flow reducing entrainment.   \nA review of the literature (figure 2) gives an average reduction in soil loss of \n78%, with a range of 40\u2013100% from the use of crop residues.  A number of studies \nhave found that greater reductions in sediment loss occur at higher levels (>40% cover) \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n10 \nof residue surface cover (e.g. 56, 103, 108, 118).  However, even small amounts of \nresidue (12% cover (108)) have the potential to greatly reduce soil losses, and mulching \nrates that are sufficiently low to not have an adverse effect on early growth and crop \nyields will reduce erosion (107,108, 111). \nResidues from different crops vary in their effectiveness at reducing erosion and \noverland flow: some will decompose before high-risk periods for soil erosion are over \n(107), with incorporated residues generally decomposing more quickly (146).  Brown \nat al. (31) found that the size of the residue was not important in relation to how much \nit reduced erosion. \nAs crop residues decay they release nutrients which may be lost in surface \nrunoff or by leaching (152).  Manipulating nitrogen usage with crop residues is a \ncomplex process determined by the relative timings of N immobilisation, \nmineralization and plant uptake.  Perhaps as a result of this, the use of crop residues has \nonly been moderately successful for reducing N leaching.  Thomas and Christensen \n(181) conducted a lysimeter study on sandy loam soils.  They found NO3 losses were \nnot significantly different when rye and barley residues were left on the soil surface, \nalthough the results indicated a slight reduction in leaching.  Short-term reductions in \nNO3 losses were identified but these were balanced by later increases.  Rainfall \nsimulator studies have also shown an increase in NO3 and ammonia (NH3) in leachate \nwith an increasing residue application rate.  Leachate (from simulated rainfall) was \ncollected from corn residues with field loading rates of 5, 7, 10 and 15 tons ha-1.  \nVolume-weighted nutrient concentrations of NO3 and ammonia increased by 16% \n(NO3) and 41% (ammonia) between the lowest and highest residue application rates \n(147).  Similar results were identified by Stenberg et al. (168).  Deeper incorporation \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n11 \nand the use of finely ground residue leads to greater N immobilisation and a reduced \nrisk of leaching (4). \nDespite increased N leaching, crop residues have generally been successful in \nreducing N in overland flow.   Mostaghimi et al. (118) found that 750 kg ha-1 of rye \nresidue left on the surface (in no-tilled areas) resulted in a reduction of 86% in NO3, \n97% in NH3, 98% in Kjeldahl N, 97% in sediment total N and 99% in total N when \ncompared to the control.  However, higher residue rates of 1500 kg ha-1 resulted in a \nsmaller reduction in the total N load in no-till areas compared to the control, and \nincreased loads of NO3 in conventionally tilled areas.  Residues were less successful in \nconventionally tilled areas, with a 64% reduction in total N compared to the control.  In \na no-till corn cropping system N losses in overland flow were reduced by 76% on land \nwith 100% residue cover, compared to a control with no residue cover.  This reduction \ncan be attributed to smaller volumes of overland flow (182).  When rainfall simulations \nwere carried out on a dry soil, Torbert et al. (183) found that initiation of surface runoff \nwas delayed and loss of nutrients was reduced by surface-spread corn residue.  There \nwas a 97% reduction in N content of surface runoff on dry soil and 95% reduction on a \nwet soil.   \nSoil moisture is higher in areas where surface residues have been applied than \nin areas left bare, and this creates conditions that are more conducive to N2O \nproduction.  This is as a result of reduced evaporation, an increase in the carbon content \nof the soil and a supply of easily mineralizable N (71, 190).  At a residue application \nrate of 8 tons ha-1 of wheat (left on the surface), N2O emissions increased from 1.6 kg \nN2O ha-1 (in the control) to 2.8 kg N2O ha-1.  At the very high residue application rate \nof 16 tons ha-1, N2O emissions were to 3.5 kg N2O ha-1 (71).  The amount of N2O \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n12 \nemission depends on the quantity and quality (C:N ratio) of the residue; highest \nemissions are found after the incorporation of residues with a low C:N ratio (9, 191). \nThere has been relatively little research into P in relation to crop residues.  As \nwith N, there is potential for an increase in P losses as P in the residues is mineralized.  \nIn an incubation experiment, Sharley and Smith (154) found that significantly greater \namounts of P were leached from surface-applied residues than from incorporated \nresidues.  Greater leaching losses of P have also been found in field trials using a \nrainfall simulator.  Working on a clay soil with corn residue applications of 5, 7, 10 and \n15 tons ha-1, Schreiber (147) found that the concentration of P in leachate increased \nwith increasing residue cover.  This was explained by a greater contact time between \nthe rainfall and the crop residue as flow rates of overland flow are reduced, allowing \nmore time for P to leach from residues. \nCrop residues have been much more successful in reducing P losses in overland \nflow than in leachate.  Both Torbert et al. (183) and Andraski et al. (5) found that PO4 \nlosses in surface runoff were reduced with corn residue.  Torbert et al. (183) found a \nseven-fold reduction.  These reductions have been attributed to increased infiltration \nand reduced sediment losses (5). \nCrop residues increase the C content of soils. This has a number of important \nadvantages in improving soil structure and moisture retention, and increasing C \nsequestration.  It also causes some potential concerns regarding the loss of C in leachate \nand overland flow, or by gaseous emissions.  Losses of total organic carbon in leachate \nwere found to increase with the amount of corn residue applied (147). However, \nTiscareno-Lopez et al. (182) found that total organic matter in runoff was reduced by \n85% as corn residue cover was increased from zero to 100%.  The reduction in carbon \nlost was primarily due to a reduction in the volume of runoff produced. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n13 \nEmissions of CO2 increase significantly with residue application, although the \namount of CO2 emitted can depend on the type of residue and the soil.  Velthof et al. \n(191) investigated CO2 emissions from a range of residues on both sandy and clay soils.  \nThe combinable crops investigated (barley, wheat and maize, both fertilised and \nunfertilised) all gave very similar results, with an average increase of 60% on sandy \nsoils and an average increase of 47% on clay soils.  Govaets et al. (57) found very \ndifferent results with wheat and maize residues on a coarse sandy clay soil in Mexico.  \nIn this no-till system, CO2 production was lower when residue was incorporated than \nwhen it was removed. \nSoils frequently have both positive (emission) and negative (consumption) \nfluxes of CH4; with crop residues negative fluxes are more frequent and there is \ngenerally a larger CH4 consumption where residues are retained rather than being \nremoved (70).  Jacinthe and Lal (70) identified a weak (not significant) trend for \nincreasing CH4 emissions with increasing residue cover, suggesting that this is an area \nrequiring further investigation. \nAs crop residues reduce runoff and sediment losses they also have a great \npotential to reduce losses of pesticides.  Concentrations of pesticides in overland flow \nare only reduced by a small amount in runoff.  However, the reductions in runoff \nquantity results in reductions in pesticide losses.  In a laboratory rainfall simulation of \noverland flow concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor, Smith et al. (164) found a \nsignificant reduction with 30% residue cover one and eight days after application.  \nMyers et al. (121) conducted a field trial with mowed corn stover left on the surface, \nand found an 11% reduction in pesticide loss. \nThe other pollutants being considered in this study have not been investigated in \nrelation to crop residues, although, as with N2O, there is a possibility of increased H2S \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n14 \nrelease due to wetter soils.  Pathogen movement is also likely to be reduced due to \nincreased infiltration and reduced overland flow volumes.  Both are areas requiring \nfurther investigation. \n \nCrop residues \u2013 Summary (figure 2) \n\u2022 Crop residues are very successful in reducing sediment losses, even \nat low cover. \n\u2022 N, P and C in runoff are also reduced. However, losses in leaching \nmay increase. \n\u2022 Gaseous emissions of N2O and CO2 can increase with crop residues; \nthe pattern for CH4 is less clear. \n\u2022 Losses of the pesticides atrazine and metolachlor can be reduced \nusing crop residues. \n \nIV. No-tillage \nNo-tillage (NT) is often promoted as a way of reducing diffuse pollution, \nparticularly soil erosion, and as a means of sequestering carbon. In this review we \ndefine NT as a system where the soil surface has not been disturbed prior to seeding \nand where crop residues are left on the soil surface. Conventional tillage (CT) is \ndefined here as a system which inverts the soil using a mouldboard plough. There are a \nnumber of other forms of tillage which lie between these two extremes, but for the \npurpose of this review we will contrast NT with CT.  NT is generally accepted as being \nbeneficial to the physical condition of the soil. Soils under NT generally have higher \norganic matter, more stable aggregates (199, 185), lower susceptibility to soil crusting \n(185), and more soil faunal and microbial activity (58, 185) leading to increased \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n15 \ninfiltration. As NT does not mix the soil, nutrients and agrochemicals accumulate at the \nsoil surface and concentrations are generally higher in this region than in CT soils (80, \n53).  \nA large number of studies have compared soil erosion rates from NT and CT \nsoils. In a review of 28 studies with plot sizes from 0.13 m\u00b2 to 750 m\u00b2 (171, 172), soil \nloss was changed by between 100 and -100% of that found in the CT treatment, with a \nmean reduction of 69% (figure 3). This is attributed to the more stable soil structure \nunder NT (66). Typically, the reduction in soil loss is greater than the reduction in \noverland flow (figure 3); however, there is considerable variation in the results of the \nstudies reviewed. This is in part due to the different scales and measurement techniques \nemployed by the investigators, but it is also to the result of variability in soil response \nto tillage. This variability is due to inherent soil properties and the antecedent \nconditions when the tillage takes place. Many of the studies reported were only of short \nduration, which may make it difficult to realise the benefits of NT, which can take up to \nfour years to become apparent (16).  \nAs much of the phosphorus found in the soil is associated with particles in the \nsilt and clay size fraction (173), the lower sediment losses associated with NT give rise \nto a lower TP loss than CT.  This is despite higher concentrations of P at the soil \nsurface in NT systems (53), leading to higher TP concentrations in overland flow. \nDissolved P losses in overland flow are less commonly quoted in the literature, but the \nstudies reviewed (16, 60, 42, 197) all found higher concentrations of dissolved P from \nNT areas than from CT areas (figure 3). This is because while overland flow volumes \nmay be reduced by NT, the concentrations of dissolved P in the runoff are higher from \ntreatments with less soil disturbance (16, 129, 142).  Higher concentrations of dissolved \nP may lead to higher dissolved P losses from sites with lower runoff (197, 142, 148). In \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n16 \na Brazilian study, dissolved P concentrations in the runoff were five times greater than \nthose from the CT plots on a Hapludox soil subjected to rainfall simulation four years \nafter imposing the treatment. This was a result of P concentrations in the upper 0\u2013\n0.025cm of the soil being 5.3 times those in the CT treatment (16). \nNT leads to increases in the concentration of N in the surface of the soil \nassociated with residue and fertiliser additions (80). NO3 losses in runoff tend to be \nsmall relative to the loss by leaching.  However, studies have shown that the proportion \nof dissolved N and P relative to the total N and P lost is higher in NT systems.  A three-\nyear study of nutrient losses in overland flow from CT and NT maize plots on a silt \nloam soil in Missippi, USA found that solution losses for N and P ranged from 0.6 to \n9% from CT and 39.1 to 53.9% from NT plots (102). \nIt is not clear whether NT encourages leaching losses. Better soil structure \nencourages infiltration \u2013 the converse of reducing surface runoff (figure 3); however, \nthis is not always translated into greater N leaching losses.  Concern has been raised \nabout the need to use more N fertiliser in NT systems because of the build-up of \norganic matter under NT, which leads to increased N immobilisation at the soil surface \n(100). Randall and Iragavarapu (134), Malhi et al. (98) and McConkey et al. (100) \nfound lower residual NO3-N content within the profile of NT soils compared to CT \nsoils.   Work on an 11-year study on a poorly drained soil in Minnesota, showed that \neven when drain flows were higher due to NT, NO3 fluxes through them were 5% \nlower (134) due to the lower NO3 concentration from NT (12 mg l-1 N-NO3) compared \nto CT (13.4 mg l-1 N-NO3).  \nThere is some evidence to suggest that herbicide concentrations in surface \nrunoff are greater from no-till than from more intensive tillage operations. This is due \nto the accumulation of pesticides at the soil surface and the lack of soil mixing. For \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n17 \nherbicide losses to be lower from the NT, surface runoff needs to be reduced to an \namount which compensates for the higher concentrations; therefore the literature \ncontains conflicting results. This is reflected in figure 3 which uses results from 65 \ncomparative studies of NT and CT plots under natural rainfall in nine separate studies \nfor five pesticides. It shows that, although the mean is a reduction of 68% in pesticide \nload, in some cases pesticide losses increased by up to twice those of the CT plot. Other \nrecent literature contains similar contradictions: a nine-year study of pesticide losses \nfrom seven small (<1ha) watersheds Shipitalo and Owens (160) found that average \nherbicide losses from NT watersheds were 1.4 to 3.3 times those from disked \nwatersheds, despite the fact that the NT watersheds generated 1.4 times less runoff. \nThis contrasts with work in Germany (180) which found that NT reduced surface \nrunoff losses of soproturon, metolachlor, and terbuthylazine from large (2.4ha) plots by \n30%.  \nTillage also has a variable effect on leaching losses of pesticides.  Studies \nconducted at Coschoton, Ohio conclude that there is only likely to be a few percent \ndifference between herbicide leaching losses from CT and NT, even in extreme \ncircumstances, such as heavy rainfall following a herbicide application, although non-\nadsorbed chemicals are expected to move deeper into the soil due to the better \nmacropore network in NT soils (160). Work at Beltsville MD showed consistently \ngreater concentrations of atrazine in shallow (4m) groundwater under NT plots \ncompared to CT plots. However, these differences were not significant, due to \nconsiderable inter-well variability (69). \nFew studies have been carried out on the effects of tillage on pathogen \ntransport. Most studies of vertical pathogen losses have been carried out in the \nlaboratory using soil cores. Using this method, Gagliardi and Karns (54) found no \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n18 \nsignificant difference between a no-till and a disturbed (ploughed) treatment.  Tyrrel \nand Quinton (186) have suggested that the transport of microorganisms in overland \nflow will be closely linked to sediment, indicating that reduced tillage is likely to \nreduce their transport. The incorporation of manures into the soil reduces losses of \npresumptive faecal coliforms compared with surface applications (133, 130). \nSoil organic matter is generally considered to increase under NT, as crop \nresidues are normally retained. In a literature-based meta-analysis of 56 paired \ncomparisons of organic C stocks under ploughed and NT systems, Puget and Lal (128) \nfound NT had a positive effect on C stocks in 42 of the comparisons and a negative \neffect in 11 of them. Of these, significant differences were found in 10 of the \ncomparisons where there was a positive effect. Mean sequestration rate was 330 kg C \nha-1 y-1 (95% confidence interval 47\u2013620 kg C ha-1 y-1).  The increased sequestration of \nC is likely to be due to increased residue additions with NT, and perhaps lower C \noxidisation.  No significant difference was found in CO2 emissions (42.1\u201381.7 mg C m-\n2 h-1 for all treatments) measured by Liu et al. (92) for tillage and nitrogen placement \ncombinations in a long-term continuous corn experiment in Colorado. We could find \nfew studies which compared losses of TOC and DOC in overland flow or drainage \nfrom NT and CT soils. Work over a 15-year period in Ohio (123) on six <0.8 ha \nwatersheds found that total C content of sediments passing over a flume from NT (26.1 \ng C kg-1 ) and chisel-ploughed (20.7 g C kg-1) watersheds were not significantly \ndifferent. Mean leaching losses of DOC from 7 x 7 m plots over a seven-year period in \nWisconsin (33) were lower (435 kg C ha-1) from NT than from the chisel-ploughed \ntreatment (502 kg C ha-1), but the differences were not significant. \nIt should also be noted that NT requires lower energy inputs. Lal (87) calculates \nthat CT operations produce 35.3 kg carbon equivalents (CE) ha-1 compared to 5.8 kg \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n19 \nCE ha-1 for no-tillage systems. Higher emissions of 23 kg C ha-1 for NT and 67\u201372 kg \nC ha-1 depending on crop type for CT are suggested by West and Marland (196). \nValues for the energy inputs associated with fertilisers, seeds and pesticides are \nsomewhat higher than those from machinery use, ranging between 48 and 202 kg C ha-1 \nfor NT and 40 and 156 kg-1 for CT (196). In each of the systems considered, total C \nemissions associated with NT cultivations (71\u2013225 kg C ha-1) are lower than from CT \n(107-228 kg C ha-1).  \nMuch of the work on the effect of tillage on N20 emissions is contradictory.  \nEmissions are highly dependent on soil, climate and fertilisation history, as well as on \ntillage.  Arah et al. (6) found that the date of sampling followed by soil and tillage type \nhad a significant effect on N2O concentrations within the soil. However, they also \nfound that the differences between sites were greater than those between treatments. \nWork in Argentina found that N20 losses measured in chambers over a 90-day period \nwere 0.190 kg N ha-1 for conventional tillage and 0.350 kg N ha-1 for no tillage (124). \nIn Scotland, Ball et al. (11) also found higher emissions of N2O from NT soils \ncompared with CT soils. These contradictions may be due to variability in soil \nproperties, particularly moisture, or how long the NT treatment has been established. \nUsing 44 data points from studies around the world, Six et al. (162) modelled N2O \nemissions after changing from CT to NT and concluded that after 20 years N2O fluxes \nwould decrease.  No information on the influence of no-tillage on H2S emissions could \nbe found. \nThere are few studies comparing CH4 fluxes in CT and NT. In field studies (11, \n92) and soil cores (68), NT soils oxidised more CH4 than CT soils, and the modelling \nstudy of Six et al. (162) concludes that there would be a significant enhancement of \nCH4 uptake (0.6 kg ha-1 y-1) with NT.  Field studies in Canada (59) contradict these \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n20 \nfindings and suggest that, as with N2O emissions, there is likely to be considerable \nvariation in this response.  \n \nNo-tillage \u2013 Summary (figure 3) \n\u2022 NT reduces soil erosion and overland flow. \n\u2022 Overland flow losses of agrochemicals are reduced under NT. \n\u2022 Carbon sequestration is enhanced by NT. \n\u2022 There are no clear differences between leaching losses of \nagrochemicals from NT and CT.   \n\u2022 Gaseous losses of CH4 and N2O do not differ between NT and CT. \n \nV. Riparian Buffer Zones \n \nRiparian buffer zones (RBZs) are bands of vegetation located on land down-\nslope of agricultural fields, bordering surface waters.  They are also known as riparian \nor vegetative filter strips.  RBZs aim to provide erosion control and remove nutrients \nand pesticides from water entering a river or stream (from surface runoff and \ngroundwater) via retardation of flow and consequent deposition of sediment and \nsediment-bound contaminants, interception by vegetation, adsorption onto plant and \nsoil surfaces, plant uptake, infiltration, dilution with rainfall and microbial processes.  \nRBZs vary in length (distance from edge of buffer to river) and vegetation composition; \ngrasses are commonly used, but buffer zones can consist of other vegetation types, \nincluding trees. Although a number of papers have focused on the optimal design for \nRBZs (e.g. 2, 174), there has been no consensus on this.  However, it is clear that buffer \nzones must be suitably located to be effective and should be designed for the type and \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n21 \nquantity of pollution at each location (63).  Furthermore, farmers will frequently want \nto put the minimum area of land necessary out of production in order to protect water \nquality, so the efficiency of buffer zones should be maximised (97, 46). \nThe effectiveness of the RBZ depends on many factors, including species of \nvegetation, soil type, soil texture, subsurface drainage characteristics, temperature \nslope, barrier length, relative sizes of the filter strips and runoff areas, soil moisture, \ntopography, activities on the cropped land, volume of runoff and the nutrient loading \nrates (122, 35, 110).  Some of the key processes for pollutant removal with the RBZ are \nbacterially mediated, making them highly dependant on the hydrology of the buffer \nzone (63). \nNitrogen removal in RBZs can be by denitrification, retention by vegetation, or \ntransformation followed by immobilisation in the soils (35, 61).  Of these, \ndenitrification is the most important mechanism, although this is both spatially and \ntemporally variable (35).  Partially as a result of this, the effectiveness of RBZs for \nremoving nitrogen from surface runoff shows great variation.  Review of the literature \nshows results ranging from an increase of almost 20% (97) in NO3 exiting the buffer \nzone compared to that entering it, to a decrease in nitrogen load of up to 99% (125), \nwith a mean reduction of 35% (figure 4).  Making comparisons between different \nstudies is very problematic because of variation in the buffer width, species \ncomposition, buffer area to field area ratio, soil type and runoff conditions influencing \nthe ability of the RBZ to remove pollutants.  However, the general trend is that in the \nabsence of field drains even narrow buffer zones reduce NO3 losses.   \nA number of experiments have demonstrated how successful RBZs can be for \nNO3 removal.  In Marano, Italy, Borin and Bigon (19) reported a 90% reduction in NO3, \nleaving a 5m grass buffer with an additional line of trees.  They also found that the \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n22 \nzone of influence of the buffer extended beyond its margins, as a result of extensive \nplant roots systems.  Peterjohn and Correll (126) found similarly high rates of nitrogen \nremoval in Maryland, with large reductions in the nitrogen content of overland flow: a \n79% reduction in NO3, 73% reduction in ammonium and 62% reduction in organic \nnitrogen.  Combining results for both surface runoff and groundwater, the RBZ retained \n89% of the nitrogen entering the system \u2013 much higher than the 8% retained by the \nsame area of cropland.  Borin et al. (20) found a 78% reduction in the mass of total \nnitrogen lost from experimental plots with a 35m buffer zone, compared to those \nwithout one.  Their results indicated that the amount of nitrogen lost is a factor of the \nquantity of water leaving the field. \nBuffers are not always successful in the removal of nitrogen and can even cause \nincreases in the nitrogen loading.  Individual catchment hydrology is critical to the \nsuccess of RBZs (89), but there also appears to be a relationship with buffer length.  A \nnumber of studies have considered the effect of RBZ length on nitrogen removal (e.g. \n97,106, 174) and it is generally true that a longer buffer zone will be more effective in \nremoving nutrients.  Magette et al. (97) found that 9.2m buffer zones were more \neffective at removing nitrogen than 4.6m buffers on a sandy loam soil.  Plots were \ntreated with either 30% urea ammonium NO3 solution at a rate of 112 kg N ha-1, or \nbroiler litter with a nitrogen content approximately equal to 353 kg N ha-1.  For the \nammonium nitrate solution, the 9.2m buffer gave an average reduction (compared to \nthe control) of 51%, whereas the 4.6m buffer gave an average increase of 15%.  Where \nbroiler litter had been applied the 9.2m plot resulted in a 28% average reduction, \nwhereas the 4.6m plot gave an increase of 20%.   \nBuffer zones can act on shallow groundwaters through vegetative uptake and by \nproviding carbon for denitrification (165). Haycock and Burt (63) estimated that uptake \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n23 \nby microbial biomass or denitrification accounted for 60\u201370% of the NO3 reduction in \ngroundwaters in an RBZ.  In a review of 10 experimental plots in six studies, Osborne \nand Kovacic (122) found NO3 removal from subsurface waters varied between 40 and \n100%.  Groundwater mediation by RBZs is primarily associated with trees (46), but \ngrasslands also have the potential to remove NO3 from groundwaters.  Osborne and \nKovacic (122) found forest buffers were significantly more efficient than grasslands at \nremoval of NO3 from groundwater.  Haycock and Burt (63) found an 82% reduction in \nNO3 concentration in waters passing under a floodplain.   In a survey of NO3 losses \nfrom sites with and without hardwood buffer zones, the highest NO3 concentration \noccurred in areas without RBZs (165).   \nDespite this success, the removal of NO3 from groundwater and overland flow \nby denitrification presents a potential problem.  N2O is an intermediate of \ndenitrification and is an important greenhouse gas.  N2O is an important product of \ndenitrification when NO3 loading in the buffer zone is high (65).  Production is variable \nin the environment with hotspots of production. Soil type and moisture content are the \nmajor control; secondary controls include fertiliser use, carbon source and soil \ntemperature (61, 96).  There are much higher levels of N2O produced in RBZs than \nfield margins, with forested buffers producing seven times more N2O than grassed ones \n(65). \nRBZs have been widely used to reduce the impact of soil erosion.  They \ndecrease the amount of soil entering waterways by reducing flow velocity of overland \nflow and consequently increasing the deposition of sediment.  Buffer zones also \nincrease the surface roughness, further reducing the runoff velocity (174).  Review of \nthe literature (figure 4) suggests that RBZs reduce the sediment load in surface runoff \nbetween 0 and 99%.  The average reduction is 75%, suggesting that RBZs are highly \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n24 \neffective in removing sediment from surface runoff,  although it should be noted that \nmany of the studies were carried out at the plot scale and RBZs may be less effective in \nlandscapes that encourage flow accumulation.  For sediment deposition to occur it is \nessential that runoff passes slowly through the buffer (44).  The area upslope of the \nbuffer is the most important area for deposition, as this is where flow is initially slowed \n(145).  The majority of deposition within the buffer occurs in the upper area (110, 178).  \nOver time the sediment will build up, initially filling depressions and eventually \nburying vegetation (106).  Larger particles are more easily trapped within a RBZ than \nfine particles (93, 174).  The slower settling velocities of fine clay particles mean that \nthey require a greater distance to settle from the flow.  Loch et al. (93) compare the \nsettling velocities of 0.02mm diameter particles with 0.002 diameter particles.  The \nformer would settle out in 48 seconds in a 20mm deep flow \u2013 this is achievable within a \n10m buffer on a shallow slope.  For the smaller particle size it would require 90 \nminutes for the particles to be deposited \u2013 this is not a feasible retention time in an \nRBZ.  Silt and sand are deposited in RBZs, although fine and medium clay particles are \ntoo small and are only deposited when aggregates are formed (177, 178). \nLonger buffer zones clearly have the potential to provide greater deposition \nopportunities for sediment, even under concentrated flow conditions (18).  Abu-Zreig et \nal. (1) found that filter length rapidly increased the proportion of sediment trapped up to \na length of 10m; however, after 10m this increase tailed off, giving very little change in \nthe quantities of sediment trapped between 10 and 15m.  Vegetation type also has the \npotential to alter the RBZ\u2019s trapping efficiency.  Syversen (178) found a forested buffer \nzone trapped significantly more particles than a grassed one.  There have been fewer \ncatchment-based studies, but it is known that buffers do not perform well at trapping \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n25 \nsediment in converging landscapes.  Here water and sediment is concentrated in valley \nbottoms before passing across the buffer and into the stream. \nP removal is very closely related to sediment removal when the surface runoff \nhas a high particulate concentration (2). Despite this, RBZs are generally less effective \nat removing P than sediment, potentially because a large fraction of the P is associated \nwith fine clay, resulting in an increase in concentration of P in the sediment that passes \nacross the RBZ (177).  Abu-Zreig et al. (2) found that although short buffer zones were \ngood for removing sediment they were less effective for P removal.  Review of the \nliterature shows that between 7 and 85% of TP is removed (figure 4).   \nThe removal of particulate P in RBZs occurs by deposition of sediments.  \nDissolved P is mainly removed by sorption by soil and uptake by vegetation.  \nInfiltration and filtration are also important (190).  Sediment removal is not the only \nprocess that is dependant on a reduced flow rate and consequently longer buffers are \nmore effective than short buffers for P removal.  Syversen (175) found that a 10m \nbuffer was significantly more effective in removing P than a 5m buffer.  However, \nAbu-Zreig et al. (2) reported a steady increase in P trapping efficiency up to 10m, but \nthis increase declined after 10m.  Working at a watershed scale, Reed and Carpenter \n(137) found that the shape and continuity of the buffer was more closely related to the \nP retention than the length of the buffer. \nRBZs are more effective at removing some forms of P than others.  A number \nof studies have identified increases in reactive or dissolved forms of P as runoff waters \npass through RBZs (188, 189, 41, 126): several of these studies found increases of over \n50% in the dissolved or reactive P load (188,41).  Spruill (165) also found increases in \nshallow groundwater concentrations of P associated with RBZs, which is in agreement \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n26 \nwith Osborn and Kovacic (122), who suggest that forested buffers may also leak P to \nshallow groundwater. \nIncreases in dissolved or reactive P may be associated with vegetation type or \nmanagement.  In comparisons between forested and grassed buffers and grass and \nmixed vegetation buffers, the cutting and removal of vegetation appeared to be the key \ndifference between a reduction and increase in reactive P.  The source of this P is most \nlikely to be leaching from decaying vegetation (188, 189).   \nCarbon has received relatively little attention with regard to RBZs, although \nthere is some evidence for increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reaching \nwaterways where forested buffers are present.  In a sub-watershed scale study in \nMaryland, Peterjohn and Correll (126) found a 2.9-fold increase in DOC and an \nincrease in the proportion of organic carbon per unit of sediment from 1.5 to 8.2%.  A \nsecond study, in North Carolina, compared buffer and non-buffer areas in a watershed.  \nThis study found an increase in DOC in shallow and deep groundwater under forested \nRBZs.  Increased levels of DOC in groundwaters have a number of potential impacts.  \nCarbon is important for denitrification and so can lead to increased N2O losses.  It also \ninfluences the water pH and is related to CO2 losses (165).  If the buffer zone is \nsaturated there is also an increased chance of methane production.   \nSulphur has received even less attention than carbon with regard to RBZs. \nHowever, there is potential for hydrogen sulphide production in saturated buffers. \nRBZs have also been used to reduce faecal bacteria losses from manure \namended soils.  There is some similarity between manure-borne TP concentration and \nfaecal coliform concentration (170).  This is because faecal bacteria are very small and \nwould behave much like clay particles (36) which P binds to.  The small size of the \nfaecal bacteria means that RBZs are limited in their potential to reduce losses.  Coyne \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n27 \net al. (36) reported a 59% average reduction in faecal bacteria leaving an RBZ than \nentering, and Young et al. (198) reported a 70% reduction.  Despite these successes, \nCoyne et al. (37) warn that there is potential for RBZs to become a reservoir for \nsediment-bound bacteria: they found that by the end of a one-hour simulated rainfall \nevent (intensity 64mm hr-1) the flow-weighted mean concentrations of faecal bacteria \nleaving the buffer exceeded those entering. \nRBZs are also quite effective for the removal of pesticides, with reductions of \nbetween 0 and 100% and a mean of 78% reported in the literature (figure 4).  Lacas et \nal. (86) presented a thorough review of the effectiveness of RBZs for trapping pesticide \nrunoff.  They found RBZs intercepted between 13 and 100% of pesticide runoff.  Arora \net al. (8) also presented a review of current literature showing very similar results of \nbetween 11 and 98%.  Examination of the literature shows that, despite this wide range, \nin a majority of studies pesticide retention in RBZs is high (see figure 4), although this \nmay not be sufficient to meet EU limits for environmental and drinking water (20). \nRemoval of pesticides in RBZs is mainly due to infiltration of soluble \ncomponents.  Sedimentation, dilution with rainwater and adsorption to plants and soils \nare also important (86, 110, 125).  Krutz et al. (85) identify the latter as especially \nimportant under saturated conditions.  The relative importance of infiltration and \nsedimentation will depend on the chemistry of the pesticide.  Different pesticides vary \nin their solubility and the strength with which they are adsorbed to soil particles.  This \ncan have a considerable influence on their removal from overland flow by RBZs.  \nSome pesticides such as the herbicides atrazine and metolachor are relatively water-\nsoluble and are moderately absorbed onto the soil, making infiltration more important.  \nOthers, such as diflufenican and lindane, have lower water solubility, but are more \nstrongly absorbed to the soil, making sedimentation more important for their removal. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n28 \nThere have been a number of potential problems identified with the use of \nRBZs to reduce pesticide runoff.  Degradation decomposes the pesticide into by-\nproducts that can have a higher reactivity in the soil than the parent molecule (86).  \nThese may be trapped in the buffer and then released once degraded (192).  There is \nalso some evidence of potential for leaching of pesticides through the soil profile in \nbuffers (140) although levels of leaching are less than in cropped areas (15, 140). \nDespite the very positive reports of the effectiveness of RBZs for removing \npollutants, there are some questions regarding their effectiveness over time.  Several \nstudies have reported a reduced effectiveness over a number of years or after repeated \nsimulations (21, 97).  This is especially true of sediment and sediment-bound \npollutants.  The depth of sediment in the buffer increases over time, altering its \ngeometry.  This has the potential to lead to overtopping (145) or concentrated flow (44, \n75).  Another bypass mechanism is artificial field drainage, which under some \nconditions means a considerable quantity of water leaves the system without passing \nthrough the RBZ (89).  There is also potential for buffers to turn into a source of \nsediment and nutrients as soils that have previously been trapped, are released (190).  \nBuffers are not effective when overwhelmed by concentrated flows (44). \n \nRiparian buffer zones \u2013 Summary (Figure 4) \n\u2022 RBZs are an effective method of removing NO3 from overland flow \nand groundwater in hydrologically suitable situations.  There are \nlikely to be high N2O emissions from some RBZs. \n\u2022 Sediment trapping by RBZs is also very effective where flows are \nnot concentrated, but some management may be needed to prevent \nsediment build-up. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n29 \n\u2022 RBZs reduce P loads in overland flow, but are potentially a source of \ndissolved reactive P.  \n\u2022 Increased levels of DOC have been associated with RBZs. \n\u2022 RBZs are thought to be quite effective for the removal of faecal \nbacteria and pesticides, although there is potential for re-release of \nboth. \n\u2022 There is potential for RBZs to collect pollutants and release them at \na later date. \n \nVI. Contour grass strips \n \nContour grass strips (CGSs) or vegetative barriers work on the same principals \nas RBZs, but are ribbon-like bands of grass, typically 2 to 4m wide (91) located within \nfields rather than at the field edge.  They act to reduce slope length, which in turn \nreduces runoff velocity, allowing time for sediment to settle (39), and act as barriers to \noverland flow causing ponding and the deposition of sediments in front of the barrier.  \nThey have received considerably less research attention than RBZs. \nCGSs have predominantly been used to reduce sediment losses.  In laboratory \nexperiments Ligdi and Morgan (91) found CGSs were effective at removing sediment \non 5% and 10% slopes.  Only dense vegetation was effective on a 20% slope.  At 20% \nand above the CGSs were sources of sediment.  In a flume experiment with different \ngrasses and flow rates, Dabney et al. (39) found the CGSs to range from 15 to 79% in \ntheir effectiveness. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n30 \nAlthough CGSs are regularly referred to as filter strips, the main mechanism for \nsediment removal is settling (22, 39, 55, 91).   CGSs are only able to filter large \nparticles, due to the large flow spaces in the vegetation (39). \nSediment trapping mainly occurs in the backwater that forms upslope of the \nCGS.  The reduction in flow velocity in the backwater causes coarse sediment to settle \nout.  Finer sediment settles out in fans below the strips.  The length of this backwater is \ndetermined by the slope, vegetation density in the strip and the flow rate; the strip \nwidth is not important in determining the efficiency of the sediment trapping (55).  \nDebris and plant residues can become trapped in the strip, and this increases hydraulic \nresistance, causing deeper backwaters and increased trapping (39, 55).  Jin et al. (72) \nfound a 10% increase in sediment trapping efficiency when mulch was introduced to a \nbarrier in a flume experiment.  In high flows, the strips can become overloaded and the \nbarrier can be submerged.  Flume experiments have shown that once submerged the \nwhole structure can be undermined, washing away soil from around the plant roots \n(22). \nGrass type is very important. Grasses that form dense uniform barriers and have \ndense root mats will be most effective in reducing sediment losses.  Grasses that are not \nsufficiently rigid or have a low stem density have the potential to increase sediment \nlosses as the barriers are overwhelmed (22).   \nThere has been very limited work into the effectiveness of CGSs in reducing \npollutant losses, although there is potential for CGSs to reduce the same pollutants as \nRBZs.  Eghball et al. (48) showed that narrow (0.75m) grass hedges established \napproximately on the contour, were effective at reducing both P and N losses in runoff.  \nDissolved P, bioavailable P, particulate P, NO3 and NH3 loads in runoff were all \nsignificantly reduced compared with plots without a CGS. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n31 \nIn a flume experiment Krutz et al. (85) investigated the effectiveness of Buffalo \ngrass filter strips for trapping atrazine and its metabolites.  They found that in a 60-\nminute simulation 22% of the atrazine was retained in the CGS and 19% of the atrazine \nmetabolite.  \n \nContour grass strips \u2013 Summary (figure 5) \n\u2022 There is good potential for CGSs to reduce sediment losses. \n\u2022 CGSs can reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff. \n\u2022 A reduction in pesticide losses is possible, although results show that \nthe reductions are not large. \n\u2022 More research is needed into the effectiveness of CGSs for trapping \npollutants. \n \nVII. Constructed wetlands \n \nWetlands are created for a number of reasons: their value as high-diversity \nhabitats, to mitigate against habitat loss, and for the treatment of wastewater (113).  \nInitially wetlands were used predominantly for the treatment of point source pollution, \nbut there has been an increased interest in the use of wetlands for the treatment of \ndiffuse urban and agricultural pollution (149).  The term \u2018wetland\u2019 covers a wide range \nof habitats and in the context of this paper will be used to encompass all wetland types \nused to treat wastewaters, including ponds, marshes and reed beds.  These may be \nsituated on low order streams, receive pumped water or receive flows from other \nsources such as overland flow.   The design of wetlands varies considerably between \nstudies; however, there are a number of factors which have been identified as important \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n32 \nin determining how effective wetlands are at removing pollutants.  These include \nbiological, physical and chemical factors on both short and long time scales (136), \nincluding hydraulic loading, retention time, depth of water column, pollutant \nconcentration in inflow, soil type, presence or absence of vegetation, water chemistry, \nshoreline development, wind effects and temperature (50, 169). \nConstructed wetlands (CWs) have been used extensively for sediment removal \nfrom a range of wastewaters.  Runoff from combinable crops has received surprisingly \nlittle attention, but the results from other systems can provide a considerable amount of \nrelevant information. \nSediment entering a CW is removed primarily by settling.  This means that a \nnumber of hydrologic factors are important in determining the retention of sediment.   \nUsing a laboratory experiment, Stephan et al. (169) suggest that an increase in the flow \nvelocity causes a reduction in settling \u2013 this could be due to reduced residence times.  \nBraskerud (26) suggests that as larger soil particles and aggregates are transported with \nhigher velocity flow, retention may increase with velocity; this is because larger \nparticles which settle more readily, are transported in greater quantities and then \ndeposited in the CW.  However, this is not in agreement with Kadlec and Hey (76) who \nsuggest that sediment load is unimportant, as wetlands trap sediments at their inlet.  In \norder to maximise settling of suspended sediment, uncontaminated water should be \ndirected away from the CW (26).  Vegetation can also have considerable influence over \nsediment removal, as plants change the flow through the wetland.  Depending on the \nflow rate and sediment input, plants may increase or decrease deposition by changing \nflocculation rates, creating local turbulence, reducing velocity and providing local \ndeposition surfaces (169, 189).  Quantity of vegetation is also important in a CW, with \npossible seasonal differences.  At low (20%) vegetation cover in a small CW 40% of \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n33 \nsediment was re-suspended, but at 50% vegetation cover re-suspension was \ninsignificant (26).   \nDue to differences in design and environmental conditions, sediment retention \nin CWs from agricultural catchments varies between 43 and 88%, with a mean of 69% \n(figure 6).  Kadlec and Hey (76) report retention of 88% in a series of six wetlands \ncovering approximately 12ha at the Des Plains river wetlands demonstration project in \nthe USA, 6.6% of the agricultural and urban catchment.   Braskerud and Haarstad (29) \nreported a much lower sediment retention of 43% in a sedimentation pond with \nvegetated filters draining a 22ha catchment of agricultural crops. However, the \ncatchment area to wetland area ratio in this study was lower at 0.003.  Examining a \nrange of CWs in Southern Norway, Braskerud (26) observed sediment retention of 45 \u2013 \n75% of sediments.  Clay retention was high in this investigation (57%), suggesting that \naggregates form allowing fine particles to be removed. \nWetlands reduce phosphorus concentrations by sedimentation of soil-bound \nnutrients, sorbing nutrients onto sediments and vegetation assimilation (short- or long-\nterm storage depending on biomass turnover and the life time of the vegetation (136)).  \nRemoval due to vegetation may be seasonal (127) and the lowest removal rates can \noccur in winter and spring when most of the P enters the wetlands (83).  In addition to \nthe factors described at the start of this section, the ratio of CW area to catchment area, \nCW area and oxygen concentration in sediments are all important factors controlling P \nretention (189, 27, 51).  The oxygen concentration of the water and redox potential of \nthe sediments can be affected by flow rate (52).  An experiment using wetland soils has \nalso shown that P concentration of the water has the potential to change the retention \ncapacity of the CW.  When P concentrations in water are low, P may be released from \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n34 \nsoil pore water into water column; however, as P concentration in overlying waters \nincreased, retention by the soils also increased (47).   \n As with sediments, retention of TP in CW draining catchments containing \ncombinable crops is very variable, ranging from 1 to 91% with an average of 35% \n(figure 6).   This value is similar to that found by Uusi- Kamppa et al. (189), who \ninvestigated CW draining catchments with various vegetation types.  They found an \naverage of 17% retention in free water surface (FWS) wetlands.  The majority of the \nCWs identified in this review were FWS wetlands, which Uusi-Kamppa et al. (189) \nsuggest have lower retention than other wetlands for which they found 41% retention. \nFisher and Acreman (51) reviewed 57 natural wetlands and also found that swamps and \nmarshes are most likely to retain P. \nSome CWs have been considerably more successful at retaining P.  The Des \nPlains river wetlands demonstration project (described above) uses continuously \npumped water; here P retention was 81, 91, 67 and 79% in the four wetlands (76, 112).  \nIn a second wetland with continuously pumped flow, removal was 70% (112).   \nAs in buffer zones, in CWs N is primarily retained by microbial processes (26, \n127, 139).  Reinhardt et al. (139) found 96% of the N removed was accounted for by \ndenitrification.  The remaining 6% was accumulated in sediment.  Plants can also \nprovide supplemental N removal (127).   \nExamination of the literature shows an average TN removal (in CW draining \ncatchments containing combinable crops) of 29% with a range of 11\u201342%.  NO3 has an \naverage removal of 26%.  NH4 removal is generally low and some experiments report \nNH3 production (28, 83).  Organic N is also retained by CWs (figure 6): Braskerud (28) \nreport retention of 17%, which they attribute primarily to sedimentation. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n35 \nThe dependence on microbial processes leads to a seasonality in N removal, \nwhich has been identified in a number of investigations (e.g. 28, 131).  Both \nnitrification and denitrification are inhibited at low temperatures and water needs to be \nretained in the CW for a longer time period for N removal to occur (26, 131).  It is also \npossible that flood events in winter remove carbon needed for denitrification (28).  \nFisher and Acreman (51) found N removal from natural wetlands was most closely \nrelated to oxygen content of sediment, degree of waterlogging and redox potential, all \nof which are important factors controlling denitrification.  As discussed in relation to \nbuffers, N removal by denitrification can lead to N2O production if denitrification is not \ncomplete.  This means wetlands should be located in areas with high NO3 \nconcentrations in water for optimal denitrification.  Emissions are exacerbated by high \nwater NO3 content (166) therefore wetlands receiving large amounts of NO3 and those \nwith fluctuating water levels (113) are most likely to have high N2O emissions.   \nCH4 and CO2 are also emitted from waterlogged areas.  CWs emit methane at \nsimilar rates to natural wetlands with similar vegetation.  This means that areas \npreviously under agriculture will have greatly increased emissions by converting them \nto wetlands (73).  Several studies have reported methane and CO2 emissions from CWs \n(113, 166), but there has been relatively little attention given to CWs in comparison to \nnatural wetlands. \nIn contrast to carbon losses to the atmosphere through CH4 emissions, the \npicture is mixed for organic carbon in waters.  Jordan et al. (75) report an average of \n36% TOC retention over two years in a FWS wetland.  Over three years Kovacic et al. \n(83) report TOC retention of 7, 6 and -11% in three CWs.  DOC was exported from \nthese wetlands in over half of the wetland years, giving no significant change in carbon. \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n36 \nAs with other wetland habitats there is potential for a CW to emit H2S, although \nthere has been no research on this to date.  The removal of pathogens has also received \nvery little attention in relation to CWs in agricultural catchments.  CWs are used for \nwastewater treatment and are effective at removing pathogens by sedimentation (79). \nA number of experiments have been conducted to investigate pesticide removal \nin CWs, with removals of between 36 and 100% with a mean of 79% (figure 6).  \nSeveral mesocosm studies have shown very high pesticide removal (chlorothalonil \u2013 \n94% removal after 24 hours (158) and chloropyrifos \u2013 83% removal after 84 days \n(116)); however, retention times are longer than found in many CWs.  With very low \npesticide inputs, Schulz and Pearll (149) found up to 93% retention of azinphos-methyl \nand 100% retention of chloropyrifos and endosulfan after a single storm event.  Using \nsimulated runoff, Moore et al. (2000) found retention rates of 68 and 36% for 73\u00b5g l-1 \nand 147\u00b5g l-1 atrazine, respectively. \nBraskerud and Haarstad (29) investigated the retention of 13 pesticides in an \n840m2 FWS wetland within a 22ha catchment.  They found that retention rates varied \nbetween pesticides, with a range of between -2 and 40% retention.  For all of the seven \npesticides tested over a two-year period, retention was much lower in the second year \nof the experiment; for example, propachlor had a retention of 67% in the first year but \ndropped to 14% in the second year. \nThe ability of a CW to continue to retain pollutants over time is a potential \ncause for concern.  Sediments, total phosphorus, pesticides and organic N retention \nhave all been found to decrease with CW age (113, 50, 29, 28).  Braskerud (26) found \nwetlands filled with sediment in 8\u201320 years, although accumulated sediment can be dug \nout and the wetland should regain its functionality (2005).  A 10-year experiment \nconducted by Mitsch et al. (113) confirmed this when they found their experimental \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n37 \nwetland became a sediment source after nine years.  Vegetation may also contribute to \naging effects as plants may take up less nutrients once they are well established (95). \n \nConstructed wetlands \u2013 Summary (figure 6) \n\u2022 CWs are effective in removing sediments by sedimentation. \n\u2022 P is generally retained in CWs, although their effectiveness is variable. \n\u2022 N is removed by microbial processes in a CW, but retention rates are not \ngenerally high. \n\u2022 CWs constructed for pollutant retention emit greenhouse gasses. \n\u2022 CWs have the potential to remove pesticides, although they may not be \neffective over a long time period. \n\u2022 Efficiency of a CW for sediment and nutrient trapping may also decrease \nwith time. \n \nVIII. Conclusions \nFigures 1 to 6 summarise how each of the mitigation options impacts on the \nvarious pollutants investigated in this study.  It is clear from these graphs that there is \nno single mitigation option that will reduce all pollutants.  It is also a very challenging \ntask to compare the relative impacts of the different pollutants, as their effects are \napparent over differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, eutrophication may be \nan issue of local concern as phosphorus-rich water enters a lake, with impacts over very \nshort timescales, whereas N2O oxide has no short-term impacts, but is a powerful \ngreenhouse gas contributing to a global problem with long-term impacts.  Because of \nthe opposing impacts that different mitigation options have on pollutants, it is not \npossible to recommend a single strategy for reducing diffuse pollution. Instead we must \nIn press. Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology \n38 \nmake some recommendations with regard to how to select the most appropriate \nmitigation option.  Pollution swapping should be considered when selecting a \nmitigation option and the most appropriate option should be selected on a site-by-site \nbasis.  Introducing schemes nationwide and encouraging farmers to install a single \nmitigation option will result in unnecessary increases in some pollutants, even though it \nmay reduce the impact of the target pollutant.  When considering the most appropriate \nmitigation option to use, the first consideration should be which pollutant(s) is the \ntarget of concern: some may be more pressing than others and mitigation options \nshould be applied to tackle this.  However, longer term implications should be \nconsidered as well as short-term ones.  Maintenance costs and lifespan are also an \nimportant consideration, as poorly maintained mitigation options can become a source \nof pollutants rather than a sink.  A mitigation option should be selected that is \nappropriate to the location, including soil type, climate, location in the catchment, \nlandscape features and hydrology.  It is beyond the scope of this paper to make \nrecommendations for each of the mitigation options; however, these issues have been \naddressed for many of the options available.   \nThis paper has identified some considerable gaps in our knowledge of the \nimpact of mitigation options that been applied throughout the world on different \npollutants.  Vegetative barriers and cover crops are the two mitigation options with \nparticular need for further research.  Pollutants that are in particular need of further \ninvestigation include total organic carbon, methane and hydrogen sulphide.  Research is \nalso needed into quantifying the relative importance of different pollutants in the \nenvironment. \n \nReferences \nIn press.
