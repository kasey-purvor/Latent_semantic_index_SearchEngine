Isotopic analysis of human remains from other coastal\nMesolithic sites in Europe, particularly along the Atlantic\ncoast, also shows significant consumption of marine foods,\nbut the amount of marine food consumed by the El Collado\nhumans was much less than at those sites. This may be because\nof a different dietary adaptation or because the Mediterranean\nis much less productive than the Atlantic.\nSome of the most successful applications of stable isotope\nanalysis as a method for reconstructing past human diets have\nfocused on the European Mesolithic. This is because carbon\n( ) and nitrogen ( ) bone collagen isotope ratios are13 15d C d N\nparticularly effective in detecting the consumption of marine\nprotein (Schoeninger, De Niro, and Tauber 1983; Chisholm,\nNelson, and Schwarcz 1982), and marine foods were an im-\nportant dietary source for coastal Mesolithic humans. Among\nthe earliest published applications of bone collagen carbon\nisotope ratios in archaeology was that of Tauber (1981), which\nshowed a great reliance on marine foods by late Mesolithic\nhumans in Denmark. Subsequent isotopic studies of other\nMesolithic humans in Denmark (Tauber 1983, 1986; Richards,\nPrice, and Koch 2003) in other areas of Atlantic Europe such\nas the UK (Richards and Mellars 1998; Schulting and Richards\n2002a, 2002b), Portugal (Lubell et al. 1994), and France\n(Schulting and Richards 2001), and in the Baltic (Lide\u00b4n 1995)\nalso found significant use of marine foods by coastal Late\nMesolithic peoples. Most of these studies have focused on\nnorthern Europe, perhaps because there are very few Meso-\nlithic human remains from southern Europe and collagen\npreservation is generally poor in the warmer southern regions\n\u0001 2006 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.\nAll rights reserved 0011-3204\/2006\/4703-0008$10.00\nof Europe. There are, however, isotopic values for Neolithic\nhumans from southern Europe, including mainland Greece\n(Papathanasiou 2001; Papathanasiou, Larsen, and Norr 2000),\nCrete (Richards and Hedges n.d.), and Malta (Richards et al.\n2001), and these indicate that despite the location of these\nsites on the Mediterranean, Neolithic humans there had a\nmainly terrestrial diet. Interestingly, this same pattern is ob-\nserved in studies of the isotopic values of Neolithic humans\nin northern Europe, especially on the Atlantic coast (Tauber\n1981; Richards and Hedges 1999a). It has been argued that\nthis difference is related to a significant dietary shift at the\nMesolithic-Neolithic transition (Richards, Schulting, and\nHedges 2003; Richards 2003). However, up to this point it\nhas been impossible to explore any such dietary shift at the\nMesolithic-Neolithic transition in the Mediterranean area be-\ncause isotopic data for Mesolithic humans are lacking. Since\nthe Mediterranean is much less productive than the Atlantic,\nwe may not expect to see the same level of marine food\nconsumption as in northern Europe, which in some regions\napproaches 100%. However, we might predict that if Meso-\nlithic peoples along the Mediterranean coast were following\nthe same hunter-gatherer subsistence adaptation as Mesolithic\npeople in northern Europe, then marine food should have\nplayed a significant role in their diets.\nIn this paper we present the first Mesolithic isotopic data\nfrom the Spanish Levant, from the shell midden site of El\nCollado, and discuss the data in the larger context of European\nMesolithic dietary adaptations.\nThe El Collado Site\nMesolithic human remains are scarce and fragmentary in\nSpain (table 1 and fig. 1). With a total of 15 human burials,\nthe site of El Collado contains the largest Mesolithic sample\nin the country. The site lies near the city of Oliva, Valencia,\nabout 3 km from the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula.\nThe region has a rich and varied ecosystem, with sea coast,\ninland rivers and lakes, plains, and mountains. There is evi-\ndence of settlement continuity in the area from the Middle\nPalaeolithic onwards (e.g., at Cova Forada` [Aparicio 1992,\n79]), including human remains from the Mesolithic, Neo-\nlithic, and later periods.\nEl Collado is a large open-air shell midden site that was\nexcavated by Aparicio between 1987 and 1989. It yielded a\nrich Mesolithic industry, faunal remains, and Mesolithic\ngraves (Aparicio 1988, 1989, 1992). The stratigraphy as de-\nscribed by the excavator (Aparicio 1992) consisted of three\nmain units that can be summarized as follows:\nLayer 1 (depth ca. 0\u20131.5 m) was characterized by its black\nsoil and had been greatly disturbed by centuries of agricultural\nactivity. It contained mollusk remains and lithic material\ndominated by trapezoids and microburins with some notched\nblades. Aparicio (1992, 85) ascribed this material to destroyed\n550 Current Anthropology Volume 47, Number 3, June 2006\nFigure 1.

It\nwas intact and contained a homogeneous Mesolithic IIIA flint\nindustry dominated by flakes and core tools with some scrap-\ners and burins and very few geometric pieces. Mollusk shells\nwere numerous in this layer, with a large proportion from\nmarine species. All of the human burials were found in this\nlayer, and with the exception of burial number 10 the grave\ncuts extended into Layer 3. There is no mention of any as-\nsociated grave goods in the excavation report.\nLayer 3 was formed by a red clayey soil and was unevenly\ndistributed throughout the site. This layer contained cardium\nand cockle shells and lithic material consisting of scrapers,\nburins, and backed blades and ascribed to the Mesolithic I\nstage (Aparicio 1992, 86).\nOn the basis of the lithic material, Aparicio (1992, 89)\nplaced the Mesolithic occupation of El Collado between\n10,000 and 6500 BC, with the phase of most intense utilization\naround 7500\u20136500 BC. Subsequently, two radiocarbon de-\nterminations made on human bone from burial 12 yielded\nthe ages of BP and BP (Aparicio7,570\u0002 160 7,640\u0002 120\n1992; Pe\u00b4rez-Pe\u00b4rez et al. 1995), which calibrate to 6630\u20136250\nBC (Stuiver and Reimer 1993; Stuiver, Reimer, and Reimer\n2005). These dates agree with Aparicio\u2019s estimate for the age\nof Layer 2 and the Mesolithic IIIA stage. Although the date\nwas on burial 12, the fact that all graves originated in same\nlayer suggests that they are all broadly contemporaneous and\nbelong to the Mesolithic IIIA occupation.\nThe faunal material from Layer 2 indicates the consump-\ntion of both marine and terrestrial animal foods. Aparicio\n(1988, 1989, 1992) described a wide range of species including\nmollusks, reptiles, fish, and land mammals. The most abun-\ndant remains were those of marine and terrestrial mollusks:\nmarine gastropods (Musex bandaris L., M. trunculus L., Pur-\npura haemastona subsp. Consul Lamk., Triton modiferus Link.,\nCerithium vulgatum Brug., Columbella rustica L., Nassa reti-\nculata L., Purpura haemastoma L.), freshwater gastropods\n(Melanopris tricarinata Brug.), terrestrial gastropods (Pseu-\ndotachea splendida Drap.), and marine Lamellibranchia (Pec-\ntunculos violascense Link., Verus gallina L., Cardium glaucum\n551\nFigure 2. Individual 13 from El Collado. (Photo courtesy of Jose\u00b4 Aparicio)\nBrug., C. tuberculatum L. Spondylus gaederopus L., Pecten ja-\ncobaens L., Arco noaae). Mammal bones were rare and poorly\npreserved. The few identified specimens belonged to the Bov-\nidae, Cervidae, Suidae, Rodentiae, and Leporidae families.\nThere was no direct evidence for the contribution of plants\nto the Mesolithic diet at this site. In contrast to the mammal\nremains, the human bones were well preserved (fig. 2). The\nreasons for this difference may be taphonomic. Animal bones\nwere likely deposited on the ground surface and remained\nexposed for some time, while the humans were buried in the\nhighly basic shell midden. The human remains were studied\nunder the direction of D. Campillo at the Archaeological Mu-\nseum of Catalonia (Chimenos, Pe\u00b4rez-Pe\u00b4rez, and Lalueza 1991;\nPe\u00b4rez-Pe\u00b4rez et al. 1995). Age estimation was based on the\ndegree of mineralization and eruptive phases of teeth in in-\ndividuals with deciduous or mixed dentitions (Ubelaker 1989)\nand on dental abrasion in individuals with permanent den-\ntitions (Brothwell 1981; Perizonius 1983). Individuals were\nidentified as one newborn, four subadults (age 12\u201317 years),\nand ten adults (age over 18 years), including two classified\nas mature (age 41\u201360 years). Sex determination was done on\nthe basis of morphometric traits, especially those of the man-\ndible (Martin and Saller 1957; Ferembach, Schwidetzky, and\nStloukal 1979). Seven individuals were identified as males and\nfour as females. Two subadults were probably males, and one\nadult and the newborn could not be sexed. Only individuals\nclassified as adults were used in the stable isotope analyses\n(table 2).\nStable Isotope Analysis for Palaeodietary\nReconstruction\nThe stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of animal tissues\nand, in particular, bone collagen, can be used to quantify the\nconsumption of foods having different isotopic compositions\n(DeNiro and Epstein 1978, 1981; Schoeninger and DeNiro\n552 Current Anthropology Volume 47, Number 3, June 2006\nTable 2.

Several major\nclasses of food sources can be distinguished on the basis of\ntheir isotopic composition (Ambrose and DeNiro 1986). In\nterrestrial ecosystems, the values allow differentiation13d C\nbetween and plant sources, as well as between marineC C3 4\nand terrestrial protein sources (Schoeninger, DeNiro, and\nTauber 1983). However, since edible plants are unknownC4\nfrom Mesolithic Europe, values in this context will only13d C\nbe a measure of the marine versus the terrestrial protein com-\nponent of the diet. The value indicates the trophic level15d N\nof the protein consumed, and mammal bone collagen values\nare 2\u20134\u2030 higher than the average value of dietary protein\n(Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984). In aquatic systems, in which\ngenerally there are more steps in the food chain than in ter-\nrestrial ecosystems, the values of top-level consumers15d N\nare much higher than the values of their terrestrial counter-\nparts. For example, for terrestrial carnivores such as wolves\nin Europe, we might expect values of 10\u0002 1\u2030 , whereas15d N\npiscivorous fish can have values of 12\u2030 and marine mammals\nsuch as seals values of 15\u2030 (Richards and Hedges 1999b).\nIn freshwater ecosystems the values can mimic terrestrial13d C\nvalues or can be more or less enriched, depending on local\ncircumstances such as the input of dissolved carbonates from\nunderlying bedrock. In these freshwater systems, the 15d N\nvalues generally follow marine systems, with higher values for\ntop-level consumers than would be found in terrestrial\necosystems.\nMethods\nNine adult individuals were selected for stable isotope analysis,\nand samples were taken from the diaphyses of long bones. In\naddition, five bovid bones from the site were sampled for\nisotopic analysis.\nPrior to the analysis, all visible contaminants were removed\nfrom the bones with a scalpel, and the bones were then further\ncleaned through ultrasonication. Collagen extraction proce-\ndures followed those outlined in Richards and Hedges\n(1999b), with the addition of an ultrafiltration step (Brown,\nNelson, and Southon 1988). To summarize, 300 mg of ground\nbone from each sample was demineralized in 0.5 M HCl\nsolution for two to three days and then rinsed three times\nwith deionized water until the pH returned to neutral. Col-\nlagen was solubilized by heating the sample to C in water70\u0003\nat pH 3. It was then filtered, ultrafiltered (30 kd), frozen, and\nlyophilized. Isotopic measurements ( and ) of col-13 15d C d N\nlagen extracts were determined through CF\u2013IRMS (Thermo-\nFinnigan Delta Plus XL coupled with a Carlo Erba elemental\nanalyzer). Stable isotope ratios were expressed relative to the\nvPDB standard for carbon and atmospheric (AIR) forN2\nnitrogen, using the delta notation in parts per thousand(d)\n(\u2030). Each sample was run in duplicate, and an internal stan-\ndard was measured with each set of ten samples. All samples\ndiscussed here had atomic carbon-to-nitrogen ratios in the\nrange of 3.2\u20133.5 and therefore retained their in vivo isotopic\nsignatures, according to the criterion proposed by DeNiro\n(1985) (tables 2 and 3). The data obtained through the chem-\nical investigation were subjected to statistical analyses (SPSS\n2001).\nResults\nThe isotopic data obtained from the El Collado material are\ngiven in tables 2 and 3 and presented graphically in figure 3.\nAverage values for humans and herbivores can be seen in\ntable 4.\nThe values for the human remains of El Collado range13d C\nfrom\u000117.6 to\u000119.5\u2030 (with an average of\u000118.3\u0002 0.7\u2030),\nand the values range from 8.9 to 12.8\u2030 (with an average15d N\nof 10.3 \u0002 1.2\u2030). To interpret the human and13 15d C d N\nvalues we need to determine theoretical end points, defining\nvalues that correspond to 100% terrestrial and 100%13d C\nmarine protein diets. For northern temperate Europe, a value\nof \u000120 \u0002 1\u2030 is a good approximation of the terrestrial end\npoint, whereas \u000112 \u0002 1\u2030 defines the marine end point.\nThese values are largely derived from measurements of13d C\nmammals that have these two dietary extremes (e.g., cattle\nversus seals) and from isotopic measurements of humans\nwhose diets can be inferred with some confidence (i.e., 100%\nterrestrial diets for individuals from agricultural societies bur-\nied far inland). There is a temperature effect on the values13d C\nof plants and, in turn, on those of herbivores and carnivores\n(van Klinken, van der Plicht, and Hedges 1994). Herbivores\nfrom colder regions of Europe, such as Scotland, have 13d C\nvalues of approximately \u000121\u2030, whereas herbivores from\n553\nFigure 3. Bone collagen and values of adult humans13 15d C d N\nand Bos from El Collado.\nsouthern Europe have values closer to \u000119\u2030 (Richards and\nvan Klinken 1997; van Klinken, Richards, and Hedges 2000).\nTo determine terrestrial end points for mammal values13d C\nfor the El Collado site we measured the isotopic values of five\nbovids. The average value was \u000119.0 \u0002 0.3\u2030, so we13d C\nused a theoretical end point for a 100% terrestrial diet for\nthis region of \u000119 \u0002 1\u2030. Marine fish and mammals from\nthe Mediterranean have values similar to those of species13d C\nfrom the Atlantic (Jennings et al. 1997; Francalacci 1989; Rich-\nards and Hedges 1999b), and therefore the theoretical 100%\nmarine end point is the same, \u000112 \u0002 1\u2030. We interpret the\nhuman values of the El Collado site as indicative of diets13d C\nwith 100% terrestrial protein for the individuals with values\nclose to \u000119\u2030, with those individuals with values close13d C\nto \u000117.5\u2030 having a marine-protein input into the diet of\nup to 25%.\nIt has been observed that the values of terrestrial her-15d N\nbivores in hot climates can be much higher than those in\nmore temperate environments (e.g., in Egypt [Schwarcz, Du-\npras, and Fairgrieve 1999] and Turkey [Richards et al. 2003]).\nHowever, the El Collado herbivore average value is 5.615d N\n\u0002 0.4\u2030, which is very similar to that observed for herbivores\nin other areas of Holocene Europe (e.g., Polet and Katzenberg\n2003; Herrscher et al. 2001; Richards 2000). Therefore, we\ncan interpret the human values as indicators of the15d N\nsources of terrestrial protein, with an end point of approxi-\nmately 6\u2030 indicating a 100% plant protein diet and an end\npoint of 10\u2030 indicating a 100% animal (herbivore) protein\ndiet. Values that exceed the end point of 10\u2030 will therefore\nbe indicative of the consumption of protein from an aquatic\necosystem. Therefore, both and values will change13 15d C d N\nwith increasing input of marine protein into a largely terres-\ntrial diet, with the values approaching the end point of13d C\n\u000112 \u0002 1\u2030 and the values increasing depending on the15d N\nsource of marine protein. For example, if the protein source\nis piscivorous fish, we would expect a end point similar15d N\nto that for marine mammals, in the range of 15\u201318\u2030. Turn-\ning to the and human data from El Collado, we13 15d C d N\nobserve that there is no uniform diet at this site. Some in-\ndividuals have a nearly 100% terrestrial protein diet, largely\nfrom animal sources. Other individuals, such as individuals\n3 and 4, have clear marine input in their diets. The 15d N\nvalues of individuals with significant marine input vary, likely\nindicating different sources of marine protein. Individual 3,\nfor example, has a value of 10.2\u2030, which probably15d N\nreflects the consumption of lower-trophic-level foods such as\nmarine shellfish, whereas individual 4, with a value of 12.8\u2030,\nlikely consumed higher-trophic-level marine food such as fish.\nWhat is clear from these data, however, is that despite the\nfact that the site is a shell midden, marine foods were not the\ndominant dietary protein sources at this site. The isotopic\nvalues are significantly less enriched than those of Late\nMesolithic humans from Denmark and the UK but have af-\nfinities with the values from estuarine sites in Portugal (Lubell\net al. 1994).\nThere are no discernible differences in isotope values be-\ntween males and females at El Collado (U Mann-Whitney\ntest, for and for ). This is the13 15Pp 0.39 d C Pp 0.25 d N\nusual tendency observed in Mesolithic populations in which\nthere are enough individuals to make gender comparisons\n(e.g., Lillie and Richards 2000), although differences have been\nobserved (Schulting and Richards 2001). However, it is pos-\nsible to observe graphically a tendency toward lower 15d N\nvalues in the female subgroup (fig. 3), which may be related\nto a more terrestrial diet. We cannot forget that because of\nthe limited size of the human sample, our data set is inad-\nequate to demonstrate gender differences in access to food-\nstuffs.\nDiscussion\nThe El Collado isotopic data clearly show that marine foods\nwere an important part of the diets of some individuals at\nthis site but not the dominant dietary protein sources despite\nthe site\u2019s nature as a shell midden and its coastal location.\nInterestingly, contemporary earlier Mesolithic humans from\nboth Denmark (e.g., Tybrind Vig, ca. 6,740 BP, 13d Cp\u0001\n\u2030, d13Np 8.5\u2030 [Richards, Price, and Koch 2003]) and17.6\nSouth Wales (e.g., Potter\u2019s Cave 308, ca. 8,580 BP, 13d Cp\n\u2030, d15N p 13.1\u2030 [Schulting and Richards 2002a])\u000117.3\nalso had isotopic values indicative of approximately 25% ma-\nrine protein consumption, but this was more mixed. Perhaps\nthe early Mesolithic data from these contexts, including El\nCollado, are contributing to a picture of early Mesolithic sub-\nsistence patterns that conforms to the generally accepted view\nof mobile hunter-gatherers using a range of seasonally avail-\nable food resources, including marine foods. Only in the\nMesolithic do we see isotopic values indicating large-scale\nreliance on marine foods. Another explanation for the rela-\ntively minor contribution of marine foods in the diets of\nhumans from El Collado as opposed to those in northern\nEurope may be the less productive nature of the Mediterra-\n554 Current Anthropology Volume 47, Number 3, June 2006\nTable 4.

It may simply have been impossible\nto obtain enough marine foods to survive in the Mediterra-\nnean area and therefore diets had to be supplemented by\nterrestrial foods.\nTo explore the meaning of the El Collado isotopic data\nfurther we can compare our results with those for other early\nprehistoric (pre-Neolithic) humans from the Mediterranean\n(table 5). There are two published values for Palaeolithic hu-\nmans, both from the site of Arene Candide in Ligura, Italy.\nPettitt et al. (2003) found evidence of a marine contribution\nto the diet of the \u201cIl Principe\u201d Gravettian burial, with isotopic\nvalues remarkably similar to those reported here for individual\n4. An earlier study of two Late Palaeolithic humans from\nArene Candide (ca. 11,000 BP) and two Mesolithic humans\nfrom the site of Uzzo Cave, Sicily (ca. 9,000 BP), by Fran-\ncalacci (1989) did not produce similar results; here the\nvalues indicated a largely animal-protein diet. There ap-15d N\npears to have been a range of diets in the Upper Palaeolithic\nand early Mesolithic in coastal Spain and Italy, with some\nindividuals obtaining their protein largely from terrestrial an-\nimal sources while others obtained up to 25% of their protein\nfrom the Mediterranean.\nSummary and Conclusions\nMost of the previous isotopic research on the European\nMesolithic has been in northern Europe, where there is clear\nevidence for a marine adaptation, especially in the Late\nMesolithic. There are few data from southern Europe as a\nwhole, and the data presented here are similar to those pre-\nsented elsewhere for early Mesolithic humans in northern\nEurope in pointing to a seasonal dietary adaptation with the\nuse of marine foods during only certain periods of the year.\nAs more data become available we will be better able to com-\npare the Mesolithic dietary adaptations in northern and\nsouthern Europe and in Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neo-\nlithic populations.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Dome`nec Campillo, Archaeological Mu-\nseum of Catalonia, who directed the study of the human\nremains, and to Jose\u00b4 Aparicio, Prehistoric Investigation Ser-\nvice of Valencia (S.I.P.), who conducted the excavations of El\nCollado.
