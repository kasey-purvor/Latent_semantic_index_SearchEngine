INTRODUCTION \nPolyethylene in its crosslinked form (XLPE) is widely used \nas an electrical insulator in extruded power cables.  Since such \ncables may be required to conduct currents of several kA and \nsupport hundreds of kV, they form critical parts of the \ntransmission infrastructure (e.g. [1]) and are expected to be \nhighly resilient to failure (e.g. the National Grid Company \nrequires high voltage power cable systems to have an \noperating life of at least 40 years [2].) It is therefore crucial to \nbe able to assess whether such cables have been electrically \ndegraded due to thermal ageing, and yet no such assessment \ntechnique is widely accepted. This paper shows that the \nmeasurement of the DC conductivity, and possibly tan\uf064, \ndifficult though such measurements may be, could be used for \nthe assessment of such ageing. \nFurthermore, the characterization of the DC conductivity \nand the low frequency dielectric characteristics of XLPE \ncables as functions of temperature and field are becoming \nincreasingly important as such cables find a greater prevalence \nin high-voltage DC transmission.  Such systems are being \ninstalled, inter-alia, for long-distance transmission for pan-\ncontinental power lopping and for connecting often remote \nsustainable power sources to centers of population (e.g. [3]).   \nWhilst measurements of the conductivity and low-\nfrequency dielectric response of polyethylene have been \nwidely reported (e.g. [4,5]), there have been considerable \nvariations: for example, the UK National Physical Laboratory \ngives a wide range of conductivities for polyethylene [6] from \n10\n-13\n to 10\n-16\n S.m\n-1\n. In this paper we confirm measurements of \nthe very low frequency dielectric characteristics by using two \ndifferent techniques, which give results that are in agreement.  \nOne of these, the measurement of DC conductivity, uses a \nbespoke, virtually noise-free, highly stable DC supply. \nSamples in the form of long miniature model power cables, \nwhich have a high ratio of area to thickness, have been used to \nmake it possible to measure conductivities and dielectric \nlosses with lower noise levels than previously reported for \nXLPE cables.  \nUsing such samples we have also been able to probe the \nvery low loss dielectric polarization mechanisms occurring \nclose to the power frequencies and have found values of tan\uf064 \nlower than 10\n-5\n. Conductivities as low as 10\n-17\n S.m\n-1\n have been \nmeasured. \nII. DIELECTRIC THEORY \nWe would expect the real part of the permittivity ( \uf065 \uf0a2 ) of \nXLPE to remain reasonably constant over the frequency range \nstudied (10\n-4\n to 10\n4\n Hz) and not to be particularly influenced \nby electric field strength in the range up to ~1 kV.mm\n-1\n that \nwas used.  The dielectric loss (tan \uf064) would therefore tend to \nhave the same trends with frequency as the imaginary \ncomponent of the permittivity ( \uf065 \uf0a2\uf0a2 ) since \uf065\uf065\uf064 \uf0a2\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf03dtan .  \nThe Measurement of Very Low Conductivity \nand Dielectric Loss in XLPE Cables:  \nA Possible Method to Detect Degradation due to Thermal Aging \nJ.C.

Low Frequency Behavior \nAt very low frequencies, perhaps less than 1 Hz, DC \nconduction may dominate the dielectric loss. If the \npolarization mechanisms are independent of frequency in this \nfrequency range, then the cable insulation may be represented \nby a parallel conductance, G, and capacitance, C, Figure 1. \n \nG C \n \nFigure 1: Possible low-frequency equivalent circuit of cable insulation \n \nThe impedance, Z, of this circuit may be found using \nequation (1) \nCG \uf077j\nZ\n\uf02b\uf03d\n1\n \n(1) \nRather than considering such a complex impedance, it is \nconventional in dielectric spectroscopy to consider a complex \ncapacitance; this is given the symbol C* to distinguish it from \nthe (scalar) capacitance C of the cable that is due to the \npolarization of the dielectric.  Since in general the impedance \nof a capacitor is C\uf077j1 , the complex capacitance of Figure 1 \ncan be written as: \n\uf077\n\uf077\uf077\nG\nC\nCG\njC*\nj\nZ\nC*j\n\uf02d\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf03d\uf03d or \n1\n \n(2) \n \n   \nThe loss tangent at very low frequencies is therefore: \n \nCRC\nG\nC\nC\nP\uf077\uf077\n\uf064\n1\ntan \uf03d\uf03d\n\uf0a2\n\uf0a2\uf0a2\n\uf03d  \n(3) \n \nwhere RP is the parallel resistance equivalent to 1\/G. \nAt low frequencies, the imaginary term, G\/\uf077, will dominate \nand so, if Figure 1 is a reasonable low-frequency equivalent \ncircuit of the cable, the measured imaginary capacitance, and \nhence the imaginary permittivity, and hence the tan \uf064, will be \ninversely proportional to frequency. The real part of the \npermittivity will be constant. \nB. Behavior at High and Low Frequencies \nAt higher frequencies, the capacitance of the cable will \ncause a significant current to be drawn.  In extruded power \ncables it is necessary to have a very smooth interface between \nthe insulation and the conductor since conductor asperities \nprotruding into the insulation would cause high field regions \nthat may lead to premature breakdown (e.g. [7]).  A (semi-) \nconducting polymer is therefore extruded over the inner \nconductor, known as the inner semicon. Similarly an outer \nsemicon is extruded over the polymer insulation and is in \ncontact with the outer conductor, which is normally at earth \npotential.  At high frequencies, the displacement current \ndrawn by the capacitive cable, may cause a potential to be \ndropped across these semicons, which form a series resistance, \nRS, with the capacitance of the cable, Figure 2 [8]. (In this \nfigure, RP is the reciprocal of the conductance of the cable \ninsulation, i.e. G in Figure 1) \n \nRP C \nRS \n \nFigure 2: More general equivalent circuit of cable \n \nThe impedance, Z, of this circuit shown in Figure 2 is \n \n\uf028 \uf029\n)1()1(\n1\n222\n2\n222\n222\nCR\nCR\nCR\nCRRR\nZZ\nP\nP\nP\nPSP\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0a2\uf03d\nj\njZ\n \n(4) \n \nThe full expression for the loss tangent is therefore: \n\uf028 \uf029\nCRCR\nRR\nCR\nCR\nCR\nRR\nCR\nCR\nCRRR\nZ\nZ\nP\nP\nS\nS\nP\nS\nSP\nP\nS\nP\nSP\nS\nP\nPSP\n1\n and \n1\n where\n \n) (since \n1\n1\ntan\n2\n2\n222\n\uf03d\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf03e\uf03e\uf02b\uf040\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\n\uf0a2\uf0a2\n\uf0a2\n\uf03d\n\uf077\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf077\n\uf064\n \n(5) \n \nSince PS RR \uf03c\uf03c , PS \uf077\uf077 \uf03e\uf03e and therefore \n1tan \uf02d\uf0b5\uf077\uf064  at \nlower frequencies (< ~1 Hz) and \n1tan \uf02b\uf0b5\uf077\uf064  at higher \nfrequencies.

SAMPLES \nSamples were manufactured by the Borealis Innovation \nCentre (Stenungsund, Sweden) in the form of miniature \n\u201cmodel\u201d power cables.  These three-layer coaxial cables were \nextruded on a 1+2 pilot cable line. In this line, the conductor is \nfirst drawn through a single extruder head, which forms the \ninner semicon layer. This is immediately followed by double \nextrusion head in which the insulation and outer semicon \nlayers are formed. The polyethylene insulation and semicon \nlayers are dry cured (crosslinked) in a vulcanization tube of a \nconventional catenary continuous vulcanization (CCV) cable \nline.  A photograph of the end of such a cable is shown in \nFigure 4. \n \nThe cables were tested either: \n\uf0b7 as received, or  \n\uf0b7 air degassed by keeping them in a normal oven at \n80\uf0b0C for 5 days, or  \n\uf0b7 vacuum degassed by further degassing them in a \nvacuum oven (<10\n2\n Pa) at 80\uf0b0C for another 5 days. \nThe degassing was intended to remove the crosslinking \nbyproducts.  In a normal power cable, these byproducts may \ndiffuse out of the system naturally, typically over the first \nfew months of operation. The peroxide byproduct levels, \nmeasured by Borealis using high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC), before and after these degassing \nprocesses are shown in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n\uf0b7 Copper conductor  \n 1.5 mm diameter \n\uf0b7 Inner semicon \n radius = 1.4 mm \n\uf0b7 Insulation \n thickness = 1.5 mm \n\uf0b7 Outer semicon \n thickness = 0.15 mm \n \n \nFigure 4: Miniature Power Cables used as samples \n \n \nTABLE 1: PEROXIDE BY-PRODUCTS IN PPM (MASS) AFTER DEGASSING REGIMES  \n As \nreceived \nAir \ndegassed \nVacuum \ndegassed \nDicumyl \nperoxide \n<100 < 100 < 100 \nAcetophenone 2927 < 100 < 100 \nAlpha methyl \nstyrene \n<100 < 100 < 100 \nCumyl alcohol 4923 125 < 100 \n \nIn order to study the ageing effects, some of the degassed \ncable samples underwent an accelerated thermal ageing \nregime of 135\u00b0C for 60 days (1440 hours) [9]. In Figure 5, the \neffect of ageing on cables without an outer semicon layer can \nbe observed. The color of the XLPE insulation layer changed \nfrom translucent grey to a rich, less transparent, brown, which \nis presumably indicative of thermo-oxidative degradation \nlikely to occur under these circumstances [10]. It has been \nreported that, as well as an expected change in coloration, this \nageing may lead to an increase in free volume and the mobility \nof charge carriers [10]. \n \n \nFigure 5: Comparison of aged (top) and un-aged model power cables. \n \nIn order to reduce leakage currents across the surface of the \nends of the cable, guard rings were cut in the outer electrodes \nclose to the ends. The active length of the cable, i.e. between \nthe guard rings, was 5\uf0b10.01 m.    In order to reduce the \nresistance of the connection to the outer semicon, the semicon \nwas covered with a copper tape that had a conductive \nadhesive.  Other techniques that were tried included lapping \nthe outer semicon with copper tape without an adhesive, and \nwinding copper wire tightly around the outer semicon. \nHowever, these were unsuccessful as the resistance of the \nconnection to the outer semicon was greater than that of the \nsemicon itself. (For the samples used here, the outer semicon \nresistance could have been as low as 0.02 \uf057 at low \ntemperatures.)  The cable, prepared in this way, is shown in \nFigure 6. \n \nFigure 6: Miniature cable prepared for testing. \nThe conductance and capacitance of a cable are \nproportional to \uf028 \uf029io rrL ln , where L is the cable length and ro \nand ri are outer and inner radii of the insulation. For these \ncable samples, \uf028 \uf029 m. 87.6ln \uf03dio rrL  For comparison, a plaque \nof the same thickness (1.5 mm) and conductance or \ncapacitance would have an area of 0.0647 m\n2\n, e.g. a square of \nside approximately 254 mm. This would normally be \nconsidered a large area to thickness ratio. \nIV. EXPERIMENTAL \nThree sets of equipment were used for characterization of \nthe samples.   \nA. Dielectric Spectrometer \nA Solartron 1255 Frequency Response Analyzer (FRA) \nwith CDI interface was used to measure real and complex \ncapacitance under computer control. The sample was \nmaintained at a constant temperature (\uf0b10.1 C) in a fan oven \nduring the measurements. The excitation voltage was 1.00 V \nRMS.  An air capacitor, of similar capacitance to the cable, \nwas used to establish the noise floor for these measurements.  \nThis is shown as a tan\uf064 spectrum in Figure 7; the instrument \nwas not reliable in the filled area.  This was found to restrict \nthe use of the instrument to low frequencies (<<1 Hz), and \noften then only at elevated temperatures. \n \n1E-5\n1E-4\n1E-3\n1E-2\n1E-1\n1E+0\n1E-4 1E-2 1E+0 1E+2 1E+4 1E+6\nT\na\nn\n \uf064\nFrequency\/Hz\n \nFigure 7: Noise floor for Dielectric Spectrometer; the instrument was not \nreliable in the grayed area \nB. Charging \u2013 Discharge Current Measurements \nA bespoke power supply was also developed. This was \noriginally used with a model 6485 Keithley picoammeter for \nmeasuring the conduction current. However, given the \nlimitation of the dielectric spectrometer, it was also necessary \nto measure charging and discharging currents to implement \ntime domain dielectric spectroscopy at frequencies \ncorresponding to the lowest dielectric losses. After \ntransformation into the frequency domain these measurements \nresulted in calculations of the real and imaginary capacitance \nup to frequencies of 100 Hz.  The response of the \npicoammeter was insufficiently rapid for these measurements, \nand so a current-to voltage converter was constructed using an \nelectrometer-grade operational amplifier, and the output of \nthis was fed to a digitizing oscilloscope.  \nThe output of commercial high-voltage DC power supplies \nmay drift with time and may also contain high-frequency \nripple.  Such ripple, especially in older (analogue) supplies \nmay be predominantly at the mains power frequency; in more \nmodern switch-mode supplies, this may occur at higher \nfrequencies, typically around 20 kHz.  If the sample is \nconsidered to be equivalent to a resistor, R, in parallel with a \ncapacitor, C, then the current flowing through the sample can \nbe usefully calculated as the sum of the components due to the \nsteady-state applied voltage, V, the voltage drift, dV\/dt, and the \nRMS ripple voltage, Vr. The components of current, after \nswitching transients have died away, are: \n \nConduction current: \nR\nV\nIc \uf03d  (6) \nCurrent due to voltage drift: \ndt\ndV\nCId \uf03d  (7) \nRMS current due to ripple voltage: rr fCVI \uf0702\uf03d  (8) \n \nEven with the relatively high value of \uf028 \uf029io rrL ln  calculated \nabove, the resistance of the cable samples sometimes exceeded \n10\n15\n \uf057. For a 1 kV DC supply voltage, this resulted in \nconduction currents to be measured of less than 10\n-12\n A. The \ncapacitance of the cable sample was approximately 850 pF. \nFor the current due to the voltage drift to be less than the \nconduction current that was required to be measured, \ndtdVC.  had to be less than 10-12 A.  The voltage drift \ntherefore had to be less than 1 V in 850 s (i.e. about quarter of \nan hour.)  This may be quite difficult for a supply that is \nheating up or in a laboratory in which the temperature changes \nduring the day and night.   \nWhilst the current due to voltage ripple may be, to some \nextent, filtered out, it is still desirable for this to be not \nsignificantly greater than the conduction current to be \nmeasured. For 50 Hz ripple, this implies a ripple voltage less \nthan a few \uf06dV; for 20 kHz ripple, a ripple voltage of less than \n10 nV would be required.  Figure 8 shows a typical charging \ncurrent measured using a conventional HV supply. \n \nFigure 8: Current measured using a conventional HV supply \n \nFor time domain dielectric spectroscopy, it was necessary to \nswitch the voltage source output to a short circuit rapidly; for \nfrequencies of 100 Hz this must occur in less than 10 ms.  This \nis not usually possible with commercially available high-\nvoltage supplies.  \nA simple high-voltage supply was therefore designed using \n120 series-connected batteries, each nominally 9 V, to give an \napproximate output voltage of 1 kV. A potential divider was \nused to monitor the voltage.  A toggle switch connected the \noutput to either the battery supply or earth; it was found that \nthis switched the output voltage in less than 200 \uf06ds.  Since \nvery little load is drawn from the batteries, they last a very \nlong time and their output voltage is reasonably constant. With \nthis supply, there are no high frequency harmonics in the \noutput voltage. The only source of voltage fluctuation is from \nchanges in ambient temperature. The temperature dependence \nof the 1kV supply is estimated from Figure 9 to be 3.2 V\/\uf0b0C. \nThe temperature of the supply therefore had to be maintained \nto within 0.3 \uf0b0C over a 15 minute period. Since the batteries \nhad a large thermal mass and were well thermally insulated, \nthis was not problematic.  \n \n9.98\n10.00\n10.02\n10.04\n10.06\n10.08\n10.10\n10.12\n10.14\n10.16\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nB\nat\nte\nry\n V\no\nlt\nag\ne \n\/V\nTemperature \/\uf0b0C\n \nFigure 9: Output voltage of single \u201c9V\u201d battery with temperature \n \nThe basic circuit used for charging \u2013 discharging current \nmeasurements is shown in Figure 10.  For time-domain \ndielectric spectroscopy, the current from the cable, rather than \nbeing fed into a picoammeter, was fed into two current-to-\nvoltage converters. One of these was set to a high gain but had \na lower bandwidth, the other had a lower gain but a higher \nbandwidth.  The voltage outputs from these were measured by \na digital oscilloscope connected to a PC. The lower-gain \nhigher-bandwidth converter measurements were used for the \ninitial discharge measurements in which the current is \ndropping rapidly from a higher value typically in the first few \ntens of milliseconds. The other converter was used to capture \nthe lower current measurements for the following second or so \nof time. These time-domain measurements were transformed \nto the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) \ntechnique [11]. For lower frequency measurements the \ndielectric spectrometer was used for the dielectric response \nand the picoammeter was used for conduction current \nmeasurements. \n \n \n        cable \npA PC \n \nFigure 10: Charging \u2013 discharging measurement \nC. Transformer Ratio Bridge \nA transformer ratio bridge was constructed by adapting a \nWayne Kerr universal bridge B221, normally used for a \nfrequency of 10\n4\n rad\/s (1592 Hz). A variable frequency \nsinusoidal signal generator was used to supply the voltage \ntransformer and a tuned amplifier coupled to an oscilloscope \nwas used as a detector. This is shown in Figure 11. If the \nsymmetrical tappings are chosen on the voltage transformer, \nthen the standard impedance is adjusted until a null is detected \nat which point the two impedances are identical.  Different \ntappings can extend the range of the instrument.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nA. Overall Dielectric Response \nFigure 12 attempts to present the overall cable response at \n80\uf0b0C.  The measured points using the Frequency Response \nAnalyser (FRA) are shown as circles at the lower frequencies.  \nThe unfilled circles were shown, using the air capacitor, to be \ndominated by noise, whereas the filled circles are considered \nto be true measurements. The dashed line apparently \nconnecting these points is, in fact, the line corresponding to \nthe estimate of tan\uf064 due to the measured conduction current \nusing the low-noise supply and picoammeter.  There is \ntherefore excellent agreement between these two independent \nmethods of measuring conductance despite the difference in \nelectric fields (3 V rms for the dielectric spectrometer, 1000 V \nfor the power supply, over a thickness of 1.5 mm.)   \nThe gray dots are calculated values of tan\uf064 using the fast \nFourier transform of the discharge current \u2013 i.e. the time \ndomain dielectric spectroscopy described at the end of section \nIV.B. It is important to note that these points do not include \nthe dielectric loss due to the conduction current (since they are \nbased on measurements of the discharge current.) These \nrepresent very low values of tan\uf064, which would be very \ndifficult to measure using any other technique. \nThe triangles show measurements using the modified \ntransformer ratio bridge.  The bridge appears to give \nreasonable results down to around 2 kHz, below which \nmagnetic saturation of the transformer core means that the \nmeasurements are essentially noise. Again these are \ndistinguished by filled and unfilled symbols. The dot-dash line \nthrough the solid triangles has a slope of +1, indicating the \nexpected relationship between tan\uf064 and frequency if this is \ndominated by the series resistance of the semicon layers.  \nThere appears to be a reasonable agreement between the slope \nof this estimate and the results of the transformer bridge. \n1.E-06\n1.E-05\n1.E-04\n1.E-03\n1.E-02\n1.E-01\n1.E+00\n1.E-04 1.E-03 1.E-02 1.E-01 1.E+00 1.E+01 1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04\nta\nn\n d\ne\nlt\na \n(l\no\ng \nsc\nal\ne\n)\nFrequency\/Hz (log scale)\nFRA\nFRA noise\nConduction current\nDischarge FFT\nXformer bridge\nXformer bridge noise\nhigh freq trend\noverall response\n \nFigure 12: Overall dielectric response at 80\uf0b0C \n \nThe solid line shows an estimated overall response.  In \norder to construct this line the individual responses due to \nconduction current, polarization loss, and high frequency loss \ndue to the semicons have been considered. The conduction \nloss used was the \uf065\uf077 \uf0a2G  line since this agreed so well with \nthe FRA data.  For the polarization loss (i.e. that calculated \nfrom the FFT of the discharge current) a polynomial fit was \nused to characterize the data. Since this FFT data did not \ninclude the conduction losses, these two losses were added.  \nThe loss associated with the semicons was fitted using the best \nfit to the reliable transformer bridge measurements with a \nslope of +1 (corresponding to\n1tan \uf02b\uf0b5\uf077\uf064 , equation (5)). The \nestimated overall response follows this asymptote at higher \nfrequencies. There is clearly some inaccuracy here which may \nbe caused by the FFT being less accurate at higher frequencies \nor inaccuracies in the transformer ratio bridge. The tan delta \nmay therefore be somewhat lower around 30 to 100 Hz; there \nis some uncertainty in this region. The minimum loss \nof\n6106tan \uf02d\uf0b4\uf0bb\uf064 occurs in this region, i.e. close to the \ncommon power frequencies of 50 or 60 Hz.   \nAt lower temperatures it is no longer possible to measure \nthe low-frequency conductivity using the FRA, but more of \nthe polarization loss is revealed Results for 60\uf0b0C, as well as \n80\uf0b0C, are shown in Figure 13.  \n \n10\n-4\n10\n-2\n10\n0\n10\n2\n10\n4\n10\n-6\n10\n-5\n10\n-4\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10\n-1\nfrequency (Hz)\nta\nn\n\uf064\n \n \n60oC\n80oC\ntransformer bridge\nTDDS\nconduction\nFRA\n \nFigure 13: Dielectric response at 60\uf0b0C and 80\uf0b0C \nB. Conduction and Low Frequency Characteristics \nUsing the noise-free supply and picoammeter to measure \nconduction current and verifying the measurements using low-\nfrequency dielectric spectroscopy where possible, \nmeasurements were made of conductivity under a range of \nconditions.  Two XLPE insulated cables (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d) were \nmeasured, which had different LDPE base resins.  \nMeasurements were made at 20, 40, 60 and 80\uf0b0C.  \nConductivities were measured both before and after aging. In \nall cases the cables were vacuum degassed. The results are \npresented as Arrhenius plots in Figure 14. The conductivities \nmeasured, especially at low temperatures, are extremely small \n(~\n-1-117 m 10 \uf057\uf02d ) and follow good straight lines on this plot, \nindicating that the measurement techniques were accurate and \nwith low noise. \n \n20\u00b0C40\u00b0C60\u00b0C80\u00b0C\n10-13\n10-14\n10-15\n10-16\n10-17\n10-18\n-44\n-42\n-40\n-38\n-36\n-34\n-32\n-30\n-28\n2.8 2.9 3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5\nlo\ng e\n(s\n[\uf057\n-1\nm\n-1\n])\n1\/1000T [K]\nA unaged (1.08 eV)\nA aged (1.13 eV)\nB unaged (1.09 eV)\nB aged (1.21 eV)\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nctivity\n[\uf057\n-1m\n-1]\n\uf0cd 10.9\n\uf0cd 10.7\n \nFigure 14 Arrhenius Plots showing measured conductivities. \nTwo types of XLPE cables were used (\u201cA\u201d = squares, \u201cB\u201d = diamonds). \nCables were unaged (unfilled symbols) and aged (filled) \n \nCable B had higher conductivity values than cable A by \nabout 40%, so it is clear that the type of base resin is critical in \ncontrolling the conductivity. The activation energies for four \ncases (two cables, aged and unaged) were close to 1.1 eV; it is \npossible that the aging slightly increased the activation energy \nalthough this cannot be stated with any statistical confidence. \nDegassing reduced the conductivity significantly. This is \nshown in Figure 15 for the case of Cable A.  For the sake of \nclarity, cable B is not shown in this figure, however, the effect \nof degassing was even more significant in that case.  The \nvacuum degassed and air degassed values are virtually \nidentical thereby demonstrating: (i) the vacuum degassing was \nno more effective in removing conducting species than the air \ndegassing, (ii) the excellent repeatability of the conductivity \nmeasurements.   \nIt is interesting to speculate whether the charge carriers are \nthe same in the fresh and degassed cables.  Whilst we would \nexpect the mobility of the carriers to be temperature \ndependent, we would not expect this to be changed because of \nthe degassing procedure \u2013 the material is not itself \nsignificantly changed. There are two possible scenarios: \nScenario 1: The charge carriers in the degassed material are \nthe same as in the fresh material \u2013 their concentration has just \nbeen reduced.

The \u201creduced \nconductivity\u201d data presented is both that for air and vacuum degassing.  \n \nIn Figure 15, the reduction in conductivity, caused by \ndegassing the cables is also shown (denoted as \u201eextra \nconductivity\u201f).  This conductivity is plotted for cable A \ntogether with the conductivity for the fresh cable (solid \nsquares), the vacuum degassed cable (open squares) and air \ndegassed values (crosses). (There is remarkably good \nagreement between the two degassed samples.) Also shown is \nthe extra conductivity found in fresh cables compared to the \ndegassed values. It can be seen that this extra conductivity has \na much higher activation energy than that of the vacuum \ndegassed samples.  This therefore corresponds to s2 in \nscenario (2), in which there is an extra species of carriers in \nthe fresh cable that are removed during degassing, and which \nhave a different temperature-dependent mobility than that of \nthe carriers indigenous to the XLPE.  The higher activation \nenergy would tend to support the carriers being physically \nbigger and more difficult to move through the material.  It \nmay be possible that the volatile species are ionized, and move \nthrough the material. This is consistent with space charge \nmeasurements on XLPE cables in which the effect of the \nconcentration of antioxidant and acetophenone has been \nstudied (e.g. [12]).  \n \nAging caused the conductivity to increase by just over an \norder of magnitude (at 40\uf0b0C). Nedjar [10] reported on \nconductivity changes upon aging 2mm thick plaques of XLPE \n(Union Carbide 4201 with Santonox anti-oxidant) at several \ntemperatures in ventilated ovens.  Measurements of \nconductivity were not made in the steady state but after 2 \nminutes of the application of 500 V, and so were higher than \nthose measured here.  Before ageing it was found that this \ntechnique yielded a conductivity of between \n12103 \uf02d\uf0b4 and -1-112 m105.5 \uf057\uf0b4 \uf02d . After ageing at 120\uf0b0C and \n140\uf0b0C, this value increased to \n121067 \uf02d\uf0b4 and -1-112 m10142 \uf057\uf0b4 \uf02d  \nrespectively, an increase of a factor of 20 to 25. This was \nattributed to a weakening of molecular bonds and in an \nincrease in free volume. It was stated that \u201cThis phenomenon \nleads to an increase in the mobility of the charge carriers along \nwith a reduction in the volume resistivity.\u201d \nFothergill et al [13] published work on the change of \nconductivity of full-sized cables electro-thermally aged as part \nof the EU ARTEMIS project [14].  These cables had an \ninsulation thickness of 18 mm and were aged at 90 kV rms for \n6 months (4380 h) at a temperature of 80\uf0b0C.  The results of \nthis work are shown in Figure 16 alongside the results from \nthe current work. It is clear that there is good correspondence \nin conductivity for the unaged cables, although the current \nimprovements in experimental techniques have allowed \nmeasurements at lower conductivities and hence lower \ntemperatures.  The ageing in the ARTEMIS project was \nconsiderably less harsh than in the current work, indeed the \nconditions used would probably not have used up all the \nantioxidant. It is therefore unsurprising that the effect of the \nARTEMIS ageing on the conductivity, as seen in Figure 16, \nwas considerably less than that of the ageing in the current \nwork. \n \n20\u00b0C40\u00b0C60\u00b0C80\u00b0C\n10-13\n10-14\n10-15\n10-16\n10-17\n10-18\n100\u00b0C\n-44\n-42\n-40\n-38\n-36\n-34\n-32\n-30\n-28\n2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5\nlo\ng e\n(s\n[\uf057\n-1\nm\n-1\n])\n1\/1000T [K]\nA unaged\nA aged\nB unaged\nB aged\nPrevious Unaged\nPrevious Aged\nC\no\nn\nd\nu\nctivity\n[\uf057\n-1m\n-1]\n \nFigure 16: Conductivity Arrhenius plots compared to earlier data [13]. \nThe symbols are as Figure 14 with circles for the earlier data  \nThe dashed line is the best fit for all unaged data. \n \nC. Dielectric Loss at Mid-Range (Power) Frequencies \nThe FFT (time-domain) technique allowed measurements of \nvery low dielectric losses in the frequency range 0.1 to 100 Hz \nwhich did not include the loss due to DC conduction.  This \nshowed very broad dielectric losses, shown as a function of \ntemperature in Figure 17. \nScarpa et al [5] studied the dielectric response of XLPE \ncable submerged in water, over the frequency range 10\n-5\n to \n10\n6\n Hz.  Whilst they did not make measurements in the range \n0.1 to 10 Hz, they fitted a broad peak to the imaginary \nsusceptibility in this region using Jonscher\u201fs \u201cuniversal\u201d \nrelaxation law (e.g. [15]) of the form: \n\uf028 \uf029\nn\np\nm\np\n\uf02d\uf02d \uf02b\n\uf0a2\uf0a2\n\uf03d\uf0a2\uf0a2\n1\nmax\n)()(\n2\n\uf077\uf077\uf077\uf077\n\uf063\n\uf077\uf063  \n(11) \nFor unaged cable, Scarpa et al appear to have found values \ncorresponding to:  \n2.01   ,32.0   Hz, 22   ,108 4max \uf03d\uf02d\uf03d\uf03d\uf0b4\uf03d\uf0a2\uf0a2\n\uf02d nmp \uf070\uf077\uf063  \nThe values of m and 1-n indicate the slopes of the peak at \nfrequencies respectively lower and higher than the peak \nfrequency, \uf077p\/2\uf070; their low values indicate that the peak is \nvery broad.  This peak (shown as tan\uf064 rather than \uf063 \uf0a2\uf0a2 ) is also \nshown in Figure 17. Although their results, which were at \n\u201croom temperature\u201d, are an order of magnitude bigger than \nthose presented here, the breadth of the peak is in agreement \nwith our data.  In contrast our results are over an order of \nmagnitude smaller and show the overlap between a high and \nlow frequency loss response (with peaks that lie outside of the \nfrequency window of 0.1 \u2013 100 Hz) rather than the loss peak \nobtained at \u201eroom temperature\u201f in [5]. The value of tan\uf064 in our \nmeasurements is low enough to correspond to the intrinsic loss \nprocesses of the XLPE, in which case [16, 17] indicate that the \n\uf061-mode will lie below the frequency window for the given \ntemperature range, whereas the \u03b2- and \u03b3-modes will lie above \nit. The higher magnitude loss peak of [5] may have been \ncaused by the ingress of water into the cable or because the \nFrequency Response Analyzer was attempting to measure \nbelow its sensitivity limit. \n \n1.E-06\n1.E-05\n1.E-04\n1.E-03\n0.1 1 10 100\nta\nn\n d\ne\nlt\na \n(l\no\ng \nsc\nal\ne\n)\nFrequency\/Hz (log scale)\n80\uf0b0C\n60\uf0b0C\n40\uf0b0C\n20\uf0b0C\nScarpa\naged\n \nFigure 17: Dielectric loss due to polarization at mid-range frequencies at \ndifferent temperatures in comparison with Scarpa et al [5] \n \nThe temperature behavior is consistent with an \ninterpretation of the response in terms of a \u03b2-mode peak lying \nabove the frequency window and an \uf061-mode peak lying below \nthe window. As shown in [16,17] the \uf062-mode response is \nrather weak and its peak should lie well above 100Hz at all the \nmeasurement temperatures. As the temperature increases from \n20\uf0b0C upwards this peak will move to higher frequencies \n(activation energy about 0.5 eV) and its contribution to the \ndielectric loss in the measured frequency range will reduce. At \n20\uf0b0C and 40\uf0b0C the \uf061-mode response peak will lie at very \nmuch lower frequencies than the frequency window, however \nits activation energy (\uf07e1 eV) is much larger than that of the \uf062-\nresponse and the high frequency tail of this stronger response \nmode will enter the window at the higher temperatures of \n60\uf0b0C and 80\uf0b0C as seen in Figure 16. The same behavior is \nfound in some previously unpublished data obtained by \nBorealis using a Schering Bridge at 50 Hz and 25 kV\/mm, \nFigure 18. The tan\uf064 measured by Borealis is somewhat higher, \nand this is likely to be related to the much higher electric field.   \n \n1.E-06\n1.E-05\n1.E-04\n1.E-03\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nta\nn\n d\ne\nlt\na \n(l\no\ng \nsc\nal\ne\n)\nTemperature (\uf0b0C)\nThis work (0.67 kV\/mm)\nBorealis (25 kV\/mm)\n \nFigure 18 Tan delta measured at 50 Hz as a function of temperature \nmeasured at low field (this work) and by Borealis using a Schering Bridge at \nhigher electric fields. \n \nFigure 17 also shows the tan\uf064 of the aged cable in this \nfrequency range measured at 80\uf0b0C. The ageing has increased \nthe dielectric loss by about an order of magnitude although, in \nabsolute terms, the tan\uf064 is still very low.  This data indicates \nthat the thermal ageing has increased the magnitude of the \uf062-\nmode response, and just possibly reduced its peak frequency. \nThe ageing also seems to have increased the \uf061-mode response. \nSuch changes can be related to changes in the polyethylene \nmorphology as discussed below. \nPolyethylene is a partially crystalline material. The polymer \nchains may arrange themselves into crystalline sheets known \nas lamellae (e.g. [18]) which are surrounded by waxy \namorphous (i.e. non-crystalline) regions. This amorphous \nregion will contain impurities and additives, imperfect \npolymer chains (e.g. crosslinking branches) and chains that \nlink adjacent lamellae. The \uf062-response is the result of the \nmotion of chain segments in the amorphous region. An overall \nreduction of density via the generation of free volume in the \namorphous region would lead to an increase of \u201efluidity\u201f in the \namorphous region and an increase of the strength of the \uf062-\nmode response. The strength of \uf067-mode response, which lies at \nvery high frequencies, would not change much as it is caused \nby kink or crankshaft motions that are facile even in the \nconstrained conditions of the glassy polymer. The \uf061-\npolarization response is produced by twists of chains in the \ncrystal lamella [17] accompanied by an elongation to retain \nmatching with neighboring chains of the crystal. Disordering \nof the lamella-amorphous interface caused by increases to the \nfree volume in the amorphous region would favor the \npossibility of such motions and lead to an increase of the \nstrength of this response, though a dissolving of the smaller \nand more unstable lamella would tend to reduce its dielectric \nloss strength. It therefore seems that the high temperature of \nthe thermal ageing allows a greater freedom of movement of \nchains in the amorphous region and probably unraveled some \nof the smaller lamella. The increased chain displacements \nhave resulted in a greater free volume and disordered lamella \nsurfaces when the cable was subsequently cooled for the \ndielectric response measurements. \nD. Higher Frequency Behavior \nIt can be seen from equ. (5), that \uf077\uf064 CRS\uf0aetan  at higher \nfrequencies. We would therefore expect the tan\uf064 to be \nproportional to the series resistance of the semicon.  The \nsemicon DC resistivity was measured as a function of \ntemperature and this can be seen to have the same trend as that \nof tan\uf064 at 10 kHz in Figure 19. This is therefore consistent \nwith the explanation that the higher frequency behavior of \ntan\uf064 is dominated by the series resistance of the semicon \nlayers.  \n1.E-03\n1.E-02\n1.E-01\n1.E+00\n1.E+01\n1.E+02\n20 40 60 80 100 120\nTemperature (\uf0b0C)\nResistivity (ohm.m)\ntan delta\n \nFigure 19: Cable tan\uf064 at 10 kHz and semicon resistivity \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe dielectric response of the XLPE power cables studied, \ncan be modeled as a resistance due to the total resistance of \nthe semicons, in series with a parallel combination of DC \nconductance of the XLPE insulation and the its capacitive \nresponse.  The DC conductivity is very difficult to measure \nand the development of a bespoke noise-free supply was \nnecessary to achieve this satisfactorily. The two measurement \ntechniques of low-frequency dielectric spectrometry and of \nusing a bespoke ultra-low-noise power supply showed \nexcellent agreement with conductivities of 10\n-17\n S.m\n-1\n at 40\uf0b0C. \nExtrapolation on an Arrhenius plot to room temperature would \nimply a conductivity of ~10\n-17\n S.m\n-1\n; this is lower than has \nbeen measured before.  The activation energy of the \nconductivity was ~1.1 eV, however without degassing the \ncable there is a significant contribution to the conductivity \ndominated by impurities with a higher activation energy \n(~1.4 eV), suggesting they may be ionized antioxidants or \ncrosslinking byproducts. \nBelow 1 Hz the dielectric response is dominated by this \nparallel DC conduction and above 100 Hz it is dominated by \nthe series resistance of the semicons.  The window between \nthese two processes affords a glimpse of the polarization \nprocesses of the XLPE.  This is a very broad low-loss process \nwith a tan\uf064<10-5.  It is believed that that there is an \uf061-mode \nrelaxation process below the frequency window produced by \nthe twists in the chains in the crystalline region.  There may \nalso be a \uf062-mode relaxation at higher frequencies, the result of \nthe motion of chain segments in the amorphous region. \nWhilst both the tan\uf064 and the conductivity are difficult to \nmeasure, it is felt that such measurement may be contribute to \nthe assessment of aging of such cables; an assessment which is \nacknowledged to be notoriously difficult.   \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe University of Leicester gratefully acknowledges the \nsupport of Borealis AB through the provision of a PhD \nscholarship for Tong LIU.   \nREFERENCES \n[1] J C Fothergill and R N Hampton, \u201cPolymer Insulated Power Cable\u201d in \nAdvances in High Voltage System\u201d M Haddad and D Warne (eds),: \nIEE 2004, pp. 495-528 \n[2] http:\/\/www.nationalgrid.com\/NR\/rdonlyres\/C9AF5612-DF25-4FCF-\nABB5-69F237ACB0C5\/3411\/SPTTS25.pdf (accessed 01 January \n2011) \n[3] J.C.Fothergill: \u201cElectrical Insulation Systems for a Sustainable Energy \nSociety\u201d Invited opening paper for the 21st Nordic Insulation \nSymposium, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, June 15-17 \n2009 \n[4] L.A.
