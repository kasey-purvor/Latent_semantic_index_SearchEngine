In general, valence ex-\ncitations that do not involve substantial charge-transfer ~CT!\nare described reasonably well using conventional exchange-\ncorrelation functionals. Rydberg excitations can also be ac-\ncurately reproduced, providing an asymptotic correction\n~AC!3,4 is applied to the exchange-correlation potential. By\ncontrast, it has been demonstrated5\u20138 that much larger errors\nare observed for excitations involving substantial CT\u2014\ncalculated values underestimate experiment by up to several\nelectron volts. Errors are particularly large for local function-\nals such as the local density approximation ~LDA! or gener-\nalized gradient approximation ~GGA!. Hybrid functionals,\nwhich include a fraction of orbital exchange, offer some im-\nprovement. The aim of this Communication is to provide\nsome insight into the error from local functionals.\nConsider a donor molecule D and an acceptor molecule\nA. When infinitely separated, the vertical intermolecular CT\nexcitation energy from the highest occupied molecular or-\nbital ~HOMO! of D to the lowest unoccupied molecular or-\nbital ~LUMO! of A is given exactly by\nvExact5IPD2EAA, ~1!\nwhere IPD and EAA are the exact vertical ionization poten-\ntial and electron affinity of isolated D and A molecules, re-\nspectively. By considering the form of the coupled-perturbed\nKohn\u2013Sham equations in this long-range limit, Dreuw et al.8\nhave shown that for a local functional such as LDA or GGA,\nthe corresponding TDDFT excitation energy reduces to\nvTDDFT5eLUMO\nA 2eHOMO\nD\n, ~2!\nwhere eLUMO\nA and eHOMO\nD are the Kohn\u2013Sham eigenvalues\ncorresponding to the LUMO and HOMO orbitals on A and\nD, respectively, which are identical to those obtained from\ncalculations on the two isolated systems. We have confirmed\nthis relationship for the systems considered in this study. It\nfollows from Eqs. ~1! and ~2! that the TDDFT excitation\nenergy error for infinitely separated systems is9\nvTDDFT2vExact5eLUMO\nA 2eHOMO\nD 2~IPD2EAA!. ~3!\nWe first consider the system A5C2H4 ; D5C2F4 , which\nwas investigated by Dreuw et al.8 All Kohn\u2013Sham eigenval-\nues quoted in the present study are determined at optimized\ngeometries using the BLYP10 GGA exchange-correlation\nfunctional with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set; analogous results\nare obtained using the LDA and other GGAs. Experimental11\nIP and EA values are used. For the isolated donor and ac-\nceptor systems we have\nIPD510.7 eV, EAA521.8 eV,\neLUMO\nA 521.0 eV, eHOMO\nD 526.3 eV. ~4!\nSubstituting these values into Eq. ~3! gives a TDDFT CT\nexcitation energy error of 27.2 eV. This error is almost 60%\nof the exact excitation energy.\nWe now demonstrate that this underestimation can be\nunderstood from a consideration of how local functionals\ntreat the integer discontinuity. The exact exchange-\ncorrelation potential is discontinuous at integer numbers of\nelectrons.12 For any N-electron system, the exact potential on\nthe electron deficient side of the integer, vXC\n2 (r), and on the\nelectron abundant side, vXC\n1 (r), differ by a system dependent\nconstant amount DXC at all points in space\nvXC\n1 ~r!2vXC\n2 ~r!5DXC . ~5!\nThe exact HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues associated with\nvXC\n2 (r) and vXC1 (r) are, respectively,12\neHOMO\n2 52IP eLUMO\n1 52EA , ~6!\nwhere IP and EA are the exact ionization potential and elec-\ntron affinity, respectively, of the N-electron system. Local\nfunctionals such as LDA and GGA do not exhibit an integer\ndiscontinuity; they are continuum approximations.

From Eqs. ~3!, ~8!, and ~9!, it follows that\nvTDDFT2vExact\u20192 12 ~DXC\nD 1DXC\nA !, ~10!\ni.e., for a local functional, the TDDFT HOMO\u2013LUMO in-\ntermolecular CT excitation energy for infinitely separated\nsystems approximately underestimates experiment by the av-\nerage of the integer discontinuities of the donor and acceptor\nmolecules.\nTo illustrate this, we approximate the integer disconti-\nnuities of the donor and acceptor in the A5C2H4 ; D\n5C2F4 system by twice the asymptotic exchange-correlation\npotential, as defined from the generalized Koopmans theo-\nrem in the AC scheme of Ref. 3,\nDXC\nA 52~eHOMO\nA 1IPA!, DXC\nD 52~eHOMO\nD 1IPD!. ~11!\nUsing the values in Eq. ~4! and eHOMO\nA 526.6 eV, IPA\n510.7 eV, gives\nDXC\nA 58.2 eV, DXC\nD 58.7 eV. ~12!\nSubstituting these values into Eq. ~10! gives an error of\n28.5 eV, which is close to the true error of 27.2 eV calcu-\nlated using Eq. ~3!. As a second illustration, we replace the\nC2F4 donor with a Ne atom. The error from Eq. ~3! is now\neven larger at 211.0 eV, which can be traced to the much\nlarger integer discontinuity in the Ne atom,\nDXC\nD 52~eHOMO\nD 1IPD!52~213.4 eV121.6 eV!\n516.4 eV. ~13!\nThe average of the discontinuities in Ne and C2H4 gives an\nerror of 212.3 eV, which is again close to the true error.\nConversely, systems with smaller integer discontinuities\n~e.g., alkali metal atoms! will have smaller CT excitation\nenergy errors.\nAn alternative estimate of the integer discontinuity is\ntwice the system-dependent shift that must be introduced\nwhen semi-empirical functionals are determined using fits to\nhigh-quality potentials. In the development of the HCTH\nGGA functional,15 system-dependent shifts of 3.5 and 7.5 eV\nwere obtained for C2H4 and Ne, respectively, giving discon-\ntinuities of 7.0 and 15.0 eV, respectively. The average of\nthese values gives an error of 211.0 eV for the A5C2H4 ;\nD5Ne system. Discontinuities can also be calculated di-\nrectly from ab initio electron densities. In Ref. 14 the C2H4\ndiscontinuity was estimated to be 6.5 eV.\nLocal functionals such as LDA and GGA are, therefore,\nfundamentally unable to describe these long-range intermo-\nlecular CT excitations. The error is not a consequence of the\nshape of the exchange-correlation potential: The hypothetical\nlocal functional whose potential is exactly the average of vXC\n2\nand vXC\n1\n\u2014which gives the exact density\u2014still gives CT ex-\ncitations that are in error by the average of the discontinui-\nties. Rather, it reflects the local nature of the approximation,\nwhich uses a common average potential for the HOMO on D\nand LUMO on A.\nA simple way to improve the TDDFT HOMO\u2013LUMO\nintermolecular CT excitation energy, whilst leaving intramo-\nlecular excitations unchanged, is to lower all the eigenvalues\nof the donor species by DXC\nD \/2 and raise all the eigenvalues\nof the acceptor by DXC\nA \/2. This is equivalent to treating the\ndonor on the electron deficient side of the integer and the\nacceptor on the electron abundant side, in line with Eq. ~6!.\n~We note that Casida et al.16 have also proposed a charge-\ntransfer correction in a different context, based on a DSCF\napproach.! This correction is, of course, of limited use, since\nit is only appropriate for the case where the donor and ac-\nceptor are infinitely separated. At finite distances, a reason-\nable first-approximation would be to introduce an additional\nterm to account for the electrostatic interaction between the\ndonor and acceptor following the excitation; atomic charges\ncould be used, as in the AC scheme of Ref. 3. Dreuw et al.8\nintroduced this electrostatic term by combining DFT with\nconfiguration interaction singles ~CIS!. An alternative way to\nimprove the CT excitations would be to introduce a fraction\nof orbital exchange into the functional, which is intrinsically\ndiscontinuous due to its orbital nature. Equation ~2! would\nthen no longer be appropriate. See Refs. 5\u20137 for examples.\nThe importance of the integer discontinuity in Rydberg\nexcitation energy calculations is well-known. This study\nhighlights its importance in the context of CT excitations.\nDiscussions with Evert Jan Baerends and Nicholas C.\nHandy, during the visit of the author to Cambridge in Sum-\nmer 2003, are acknowledged.
