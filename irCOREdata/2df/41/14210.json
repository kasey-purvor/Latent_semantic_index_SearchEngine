This approach\ndepends on the collection of video data to allow the analysis of key features of problem-\nsolving behaviour within groups of students working on collaborative learning tasks. Our\ntheoretical framework derives from two sources- the CIAOl framework for evaluating\nexamples of CAL and an analysis of appropriate methods of evaluating computer-\nsupported collaboration.

This case study\ngives an example of the rich data that can be collected using video recording and\nanalysed to increase understanding of computer-supported collaboration.\nIntroduction\nMembers of CALRG (Computers and Learning Research Group) at the Open University\nhave been carrying out experiments investigating the usefulness of technology-mediated\ncollaborative problem-solving as part of an ongoing research programme. Our approach to\nanalysing computers and learning in the group has been based on a strong empirical\ntradition, as many of our original studies were with students of the Open University. As a\nresult our work has been closely associated with a desire to improve the experience of\nlearning for our students.\nWe developed the context, interaction, attitudes and outcomes (CIAO!) framework to\nsupport the evaluation of CAL developments, mainly for the Open University courses\n(Jones, Scanlon, Tosunoglu, Morris, Ross, Butcher and Greenberg, 1999). In this\n5\nCanon Tosunoglu Blake and Eileen Scanlon Enriching accounts of computer-supported collaboration by using video data\nframework, information from a variety of sources and both qualitative and quantitative\ntechniques are used. Evaluation teams include CAL designers, course developers and\neducational technologists and have access to the stated aims, rationales and knowledge\nabout the context of use of the CAL programmes under investigation. This approach\nenabled us to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of CAL whilst simultaneously\ninvestigating the educational situation as a whole and focusing on the learners. The overall\nemphasis is on educational issues and in pursuing these issues it is necessary to observe\nstudents interacting with the educational innovation. Issroff (1995) presents an approach\nto the evaluation of computer-supported collaborative learning situations by stressing that\nthere needs to be a wider consideration of the potential benefits of such interventions. She\nstresses the importance of affective measures and recording interactions.\nAnalysing students' interactions with educational software gives us a window through\nwhich to examine learning processes. This can provide information on the effect of\nparticular elements of instruction and why they work. Examining the interactions that\nstudents have with computers and with each other requires observational data, preferably\nsupported by video data.\nThis emphasis on the process requires a detailed capture of the learning setting and is best\nrealized by using a relatively objective observation tool such as video (using video is not\nentirely objective because choices made in the set-up, such as positioning of the video\ncamera and microphone, have an impact). Video data also allows the analysis to be carried\nout collaboratively by more than one researcher and different aspects of the investigation\ncan be addressed by using qualitative and quantitative techniques. Video and film records\nare considered to be essential for the qualitative study of human behaviour in areas such as\nanalysis of motor activities and non-verbal communication. It is also possible to use video\nto collect quantitative data, such as recording the amount of time spent by participants on\ndifferent aspects of a task (for example, planning, experimenting, discussion). Video is\nparticularly significant in many of our studies which involve analysing users' collaborative\nproblem-solving, in particular how they verbalize their understanding to each other and\nhow they learn together.\nVideo is an increasingly popular tool for educational researchers. In the past, video-taped\ndata has been used mainly in small, qualitative studies. With the new developments in\nstorage capabilities of computers and processor speeds, video is becoming a practical tool\nto study teaching and learning settings in a much more comprehensive way. It is now\npossible to store many hundred hours of video-taped data in computers and analyse them\nrelatively easily using sophisticated analysis software (Jacobs, Kawanaka and Stigler,\n1999). The software allows users to view video, create a transcript and link places in the\ntranscript to the corresponding frames in the video. It is also possible to identify and\norganize the significant clips of video using the tools provided. Jacobs et al. (1999) describe\nan approach which has been used for large-scale cross-cultural study of mathematics\nclassrooms. Our use of video has been more localized and consists both of video collected\nin a laboratory and a naturalistic setting. The next section explains the equipment used in\nour experiments.\n6\nALT-} Volume 11 Number 2\nThe data capture suite\nA data capture suite has been developed to capture video records of interaction, which can\ncombine video records of each user with a synchronous record of their computer screen.\nThese can be displayed in a four-way matrix (see Figure 1). For pairs of learners this meant\ncapturing each user's screen and their videoconferencing record. For larger groups a single\nshared screen can be recorded with each individual user's video. In some experiments, two\nusers are in separate rooms with a workstation each, and communicate through a variety of\nmodes. The modes of communication include either a high fidelity, hands-free audio link,\nwith videoconferencing or a specialized videoconferencing device. At the same time, the\ndata from the computer screen is converted into video format by using a scan converter.\nThis set-up allowed us the simultaneous viewing of participants' verbal and non-verbal\ncommunication and their interaction with the computer simulation, therefore facilitating\nthe detailed analysis of the session.\nVideo cameras were used to record task performance and interaction with the computer.\nOne camera was used to record task performance. One camera captures the information\ndisplayed on screen. This data collection set-up was inspired by the development of the\nmedia space at Xerox PARC in the mid-1980s (see Bly, Harrison and Irwin, 1993), and then\ndeveloped further in the Rank Xerox Research Centre, Cambridge, where our first\nexperiences with this technology were developed on joint projects (see, for example, Smith\net a\/., 1989).\nWe analyse our records by looking at a verbal protocol and by relating utterances made by\nparticipants to both events in working with the computer and any non-verbal\ncommunication.\nFigure I: The four-way matrix\ncomprising four different video\nscreens with two subjects, the\nobserver and the computer\nsimulation screen\nPrevious studies\nWe used the data capture suite to study several different computers and learning\nenvironments. One example was a physics problem-solving tool, Physica, developed for\n7\nCanon Tosunoglu Blake and Eileen Scanlon Enriching accounts of computer-supported collaboration by using video data\nstudents studying the Open University's introductory physics course (Bolton, 2001).\nPhysica includes customized tools designed to help students to solve problems and to\nperform the routine tasks in algebra and calculus that are needed for the course. During its\ndevelopment Physica was used by a few pairs of student volunteers to help designers\nobserve the problem-solving behaviour of real students and provide necessary tools and\nfacilities in the program. Students were also interviewed after their session with Physica.\nThis study lead to various improvements of the interface, including the introduction of\nhighlighting as a major mechanism for identifying variables and equations. Using the\nproblem-solving facility of Physica requires manipulating multiple windows and extensive\nmenus to perform actions such as customizing or solving equations. Without video data\nshowing how students used several different components of the Physica environment, it\nwould be very difficult to design an effective interface.\nWe have also used video to evaluate computer-supported collaborative learning in a more\nnaturalistic setting, this time involving individuals and pairs of secondary school children\naged between thirteen and fourteen years old using a chemistry database to fill in a\nworksheet about the Periodic Table. Empirical investigations by Issroff, Scanlon and Jones\n(1997) revealed that, as in many other evaluation studies, there was no clear cognitive\nbenefit from working in a pair when learning outcomes were measured by pre- to post-test\nshifts alone. However, the perceptions and motivations of students in two conditions were\ndifferent. Students in the paired condition found the experience more positive, enjoyable\nand motivating. Conclusions from this study focused on the usefulness of considering what\ntime was spent by individuals on different sorts of activity and the importance of records\nof collaborative working which preserve the timeline of the collaboration. To explore this\nfurther, video-tape records of the children were analysed in terms of talk and behaviour.\nFour categories of talk were used: topic, next, control and other. The behaviours that were\nused were mouse use, typing, reading, writing, other, researcher present and looking at the\nPeriodic Table. This type of analysis produced summary tables and time-based plots of the\ntalk and behaviour. The analysis was applied to ten pairs of students and five individuals.\nThe analysis found inter-pair, intra-pair and inter-individual differences, and the timelines\nand summaries from pairs who worked for more than one session showed developments\nover time during the interactions (for an overview of this, see Issroff, Jones and Scanlon,\n1994). Time-based analyses can therefore be very valuable, especially when collaborations\nwhich occur over more than one session are investigated. It remains a focus of interest in\nthe group to explore efficient ways of analysing video-tape records.\nAmong the other settings which have been explored using rich video accounts have been\nteenagers learning the laws of momentum (Whitelock and Scanlon, 1996), children\nworking on the phases of the moon (Whitelock, del Soldato, Scanlon and Taylor, 1996),\nadults looking at an astronomy web site, adults learning applied maths (Smith et al, 1989)\nand healthcare professionals using CoMET (Concept Modelling Environment for\nTeachers) to investigate the educational potential of a concept-based toolkit (Alpay and\nGiffen, 1998).\nWe shall illustrate our methods further by presenting a case study of two adults\ncollaborating together to solve a statistical problem (Scanlon, O'Shea, Smith and Joiner,\n2000).\n8\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\nCase study\nIn our most recent phase of studies, we are investigating the problem-solving behaviour of\npairs of adults working on a statistical problem.1 Users each have a window in which they\ncan see a simulation and manipulate it. The subject of the simulation for the study was\n'The Monty Hall Problem' that gets its name from the 1970s American television game\nshow, Let's Make A Deal, hosted by Monty Hall. In the game show you are given the\nopportunity to select one closed door of three, behind only one of which there is a prize.\nOnce you have made your selection, the game show host will open one of the remaining\ndoors, revealing that it does not contain the prize, then asks you if you would like to switch\nyour selection to the other unopened door, or stay with your original choice.\nOur two participants are first introduced to the problem by using a standard script and\nthen asked to fill in a pre-test questionnaire asking them individually what they would do -\nswitch or stay. Then the session begins and they are given the chance to use the simulation\nwith the experimenter acting as a 'game show host'. The two are then asked to come to a\nconclusion together about what is the best strategy. After the session they fill in a post-test\nquestionnaire.\nWe are interested in how the simulation and the collaborative working situation impacts on\nthe participants' understanding of the problem. To explore this we have run a number of\ndifferent experiments, altering the setting each time. In each case our focus has been on\nanalysing video records of the computer-supported collaboration in an iterative way. Some\npreliminary accounts of this work which focus on the aspects of eye contact include Joiner,\nScanlon, O'Shea, Smith and Blake (2002) and Scanlon et al (2000).\nThe problem-solving experience\nFrances (female) and Colin (male) were our participants. They worked together on this\ntask for 45 minutes, communicating via a video link. Colin had more mathematical\nexperience than Frances. In order to progress through the problem, Frances and Colin\nwere required to:\n1. make their initial decisions;\n2. assess possible courses of action (i.e. stick with the door they originally chose, switch\nto the other unopened door, or decide it makes no difference);\n3. design an experimental strategy to see which is the best course of action, using the\nsimulation;\n4. interact with the game show host and the simulation to find the answer; and\n5. explain the answer and agree on a solution.\nBoth participants initially said they would stick to their original decision, Colin because it\nwas 'psychologically better' and it would be worse if you lose after changing from the\ncorrect choice, and Frances because she trusted her instincts. They did not make any plans\nfor an experimental test but just started to try things out. After only three experiments,\nthey repeated their original decision to stick. The experimenter suggested that they might\ncarry out a few more trials since their sample size was quite small. They agreed and decided\n9\nCanan Tosunoglu Stoke and Eileen Scon\/on Enriching accounts of computer-supported collaboration by using video data\nto check out a 'changing' strategy. In about ten trials they always won. They were surprised\nand after a little discussion they both said they had changed their minds about the best\nstrategy; they had decided that it was better to change (see Figure 2 for an extract of their\ndiscussions). Colin tried to explain the result in terms of probabilities, and suggested that\nafter the opening of the 'wrong' door by the experimenter the probability of choosing\ncorrectly was 50 per cent and greater than the initial probability of 1\/3. This is an example\nof a misconception in assigning probabilities to independent and dependent events. It also\nshows that the participants were trying to match the findings of their experiment to their\nexpectations.\nProtocol extract\nR Could you possibly run me through that again?\nCYes, OK. When you choose at the beginning, it is random, so there is I in 3 chance of winning and if you\nstick, it is always a I in 3 chance, because at the beginning you are choosing one from 3, it is always gonna be\nI in 3 chance. But because (the experimenter) is helpfully giving us which one of them is the wrong answer;\nshe is never able to choose the one we've chosen.\nRHmm\nC: So she is picking from the other two, one of which is right, one of which is wrong. But she is eliminating the\none which is definitely wrong. Each have a 50 per cent possibility of being right Because we chose at the\nbeginning with a I in 3 chance, we chose now the other one which got definitely 50 percent chance. Because\nat the beginning we didn't know about the one that was wrong, but now we do.\nR But the one you stick with has a 50 per cent chance too, hasn't it?\nFigure 2: Protocol extract\nUse of the video record to understand the problem-solving experience\nReviewing the video record was very important in allowing us to construct a picture of the\ncollaborative problem-solving experience. On a general level it enabled us to explore how\nthe two participants behaved after the solutions had been agreed upon. For example,\nFrances first agreed to Colin's explanation but after they stopped, she asked him to explain\nagain, because she could not understand why the probabilities were different for the newly\nselected door and for the original door. While trying to justify\/explain the solution to\nFrances, Colin went over the probabilities again and realized that the two doors together\nhad a probability of 2\/3. Frances was happy with this explanation. Interestingly, Colin and\nFrances did not make any notes of the trials or share any information regarding their data.\nIn most cases, after the session ended the participants continued to talk about the task, to\nexplain why they would or would not change, why they agreed, what they were confused\nabout, and they also wanted to know more about the task. These informal discussions after\nthe session were helpful in interpreting the actions during the session. For example, Colin\nsaid that his partner's questioning led him to think harder and at the end he realized that\nthe solution was different from what he had initially thought. Frances also admitted that\n(in the absence of her partner) the explanation was not very clear to her but she believed\nhim.\n10\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 2\nIf Colin had been working on his own, perhaps he would not have gone so far in trying to\nexplain the solution to his partner. Seeing her unconvinced, although apparently in\nagreement, probably made him think harder. Although her verbal protocol suggested at all\ntimes that she was agreeing with him, it is clear from examination of the video-tape that\nshe was sending him non-verbal cues which suggested that she was confused or\nunconvinced. It is also clear from the tape that, on occasions, the use of a particular tone\nof voice signals other factors, such as the degree of confidence felt by Colin about the\nassertion he has just made.\nOther specific uses of the video record were made including examining the talk time\ndistribution of participants in the session (see Figure 3). The data presented in Figure 3 is\nan example of the data generated from analysis of a twenty-minute section of activity. It\nshows how many seconds each participant had talked in the different major subdivisions of\nactivity. To obtain this data we used Transana,2 a video analysis and transcription\nprogram, and time-coded each piece of speech by participants. Such data is then used to\ncompare the activity levels of each subject in each stage of the collaborative work.\nTalk time by participants\nDiscussion\nFigure 3: Video\nanalysis of how long\nparticipants talked\nat different stages of\nthe session\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\n| |Host QSubjecM HSubject2\nConclusions from the case study\nFrom this case study we have drawn conclusions about the impact of the experience on the\nsubjects' problem-solving and about the value of video records in examining this.\nThis account shows the benefits to us in detailed analysis of interactions in assessing\nlearning events. If we were unable to look at detailed records we would be reduced to\ngiving an account of the impact of this experience based on whether the post-test\nquestionnaire had been adequately completed. Our record shows that learning outcomes\nare much more complicated than this. Both participants made progress with the task\n(although occasionally they forgot the progress they had made). In addition, the progress\nwas sometimes due to the effects of explaining their thoughts to one another as much as\nexamining the results of their joint experiments.\nCanon Tosunoglu Blake and Eileen Scanlon Enriching accounts of computer-supported collaboration by using video data\nVideo data made it possible to observe the subjects' non-verbal gestures. We were able to\nlook at the video for evidence about the degree of certainty with which the participants put\nforward their suggestions or solutions to each other and what their reactions were to their\npartner's suggestions. A verbal protocol does not always contain clues to these behaviours.\nThis example is part of a larger database with which we are beginning to explore the value\nof videoconferencing and eye contact during remote problem-solving.\nMain conclusions and future work\nWe have reviewed here our approach to the evaluation of computer-supported\ncollaborative learning developed in our group over the past ten years. We outlined the\nreasons for emphasizing the collection of video data to allow the analysis of key features of\nproblem-solving behaviour within groups of students working on collaborative learning\ntasks, given an illustration with one example of the type of data we collect and the type of\nanalysis which can be supported.\nWithin the CALRG group we are continuing to develop our methods of collecting and\nanalysing video data. Current projects include internally focused work on the development\nof software and Web-based teaching for Open University students and externally funded\nresearch projects investigating students' use of remote laboratories (see, for example,\nDiPaolo and Scanlon et al., forthcoming) in a European consortium and the development\nof teaching using digital maps in a UK setting (Blake, Jones, Davies and Scanlon, 2003).\nNotes\n1. In the experiments we used the Kansas system developed by Randall Smith at Sun\nMicrosystems.\n2. http:\/\/www. transana. org\/\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank all members of the CALRG who have contributed to this development\nover the past ten years and of course to our subjects for giving their time.\nReferences\nAlpay, L. and Giffen, R.
