M. Mahowald et al.: Observed 20th century desert dust variability\n1 Introduction\nDesert dust or mineral aerosols are soil particles suspended in\nthe atmosphere, and are considered a \u201cnatural\u201d aerosol con-\nstituent. There is strong evidence that desert dust is very\nsensitive to climate, globally changing by a factor of 3\u20134\nbetween glacial and interglacial time periods (Kohfeld and\nHarrison, 2001), and by a factor of four regionally over the\nlatter part of the 20th century (Prospero and Lamb, 2003).\nHowever, how humans are perturbing desert dust is not well\nknown. It is unclear whether humans are increasing or de-\ncreasing the size of deserts through climate change and ele-\nvated carbon dioxide effects (Mahowald, 2007). In addition\nhumans could be changing desert dust aerosols directly by\nremoving surface vegetation for agriculture (Gillette et al.,\n1997) or pasture usage (Neff et al., 2005), or through altered\nwater usage (Reheis, 1997). Globally, the net effect of hu-\nmans on desert dust emissions remains uncertain, but could\nbe between \u221220% to +60% (Tegen and Fung, 1995; Pros-\npero et al., 2002; Mahowald and Luo, 2003; Tegen et al.,\n2004; Mahowald et al., 2004; Moullin and Chiapello, 2006;\nMahowald et al., 2009).\nVariability in desert dust is likely to be climatically im-\nportant, as desert dust interferes with both incoming short\nwave and outgoing long wave radiation (Miller and Tegen,\n1998). In addition, desert dust can interact with liquid clouds\n(Rosenfeld and Nirel, 1996) and frozen ice clouds (Sassen,\n2002; DeMott et al., 2003), and thereby perturb the opti-\ncal properties of clouds and change precipitation patterns\n(Rosenfeld et al., 2001; Mahowald and Kiehl, 2003; Hoose\net al., 2008). Desert dust also contains small amounts of iron\nand is thought to be the dominant source of new iron to some\nregions of the open ocean (Fung et al., 2000). Iron is an\nimportant micronutrient in the oceans (Martin et al., 1991;\nBoyd and Law, 2001), and iron deposition has been linked to\nnitrogen fixation in the oceans (Falkowski et al., 1998). Thus\nchanges in dust fluxes to the ocean have the potential to mod-\nify ocean biogeochemistry (e.g., Parekh et al., 2006; Moore\net al., 2006; Aumont et al., 2008).\nIn this study, we use a set of paleodata observations for the\n20th century to reconstruct the temporal evolution of desert\ndust for different source areas for the first time. We combine\nthe observations with a dust emissions\/atmospheric transport\nmodel to estimate global changes in dust sources, distribu-\ntions and deposition over the 20th century. We then simulate\nthe impact of these changes on climate and biogeochemistry\nusing existing models. We also estimate the uncertainties in\nour approach.\n2 Methodology\n2.1 Dust variability reconstruction over 20th century\nfrom data\nIce, lake core and coral record data provide valuable infor-\nmation about the variability in dustiness in the past, and here\nwe use the data presented in Table 1 to reconstruct desert\ndust distributions over the period from 1870 to 2000. We use\na combination of model provenance studies with geochemi-\ncal provenance studies, when available, to estimate the dom-\ninant source deposited at each site. We divide the world into\n7 different source areas (North Africa, Middle East\/Central\nAsia, East Asia, North America, Australia, South America,\nSouth Africa), and use the observations to infer a time vary-\ning source strength for each source area. This approach as-\nsumes that the variability in deposition at the sites is domi-\nnated by variability in source strength, not transport variabil-\nity; the model results support this assumption for the sites\nused here to constrain the source variability (see Sect. 3).\nThe exceptions are the Greenland and high Andes sites as\ndiscussed below.\nWe estimate the deposition variability at every grid box:\nTD(x,y,t)=\n\u2211\ni\nSDi(x,y) \u00b7Si(t)\/\n\u2211\ni\nSDi(x,y) (1)\nWhere TD(x,y,t) is the relative deposition at a particular\nlocation and time period (relative to 1980\u20132000), SDi(x,y)\nis the climatologically annual average deposition at location\nx,y for each source (i), and Si(t) is the derived time vari-\nability for each source region (i), derived in the following\nparagraphs. The SDi(x,y) comes from model simulations\ndescribed in (Mahowald, 2007), where one source region is\nturned on for each model simulation. The strength of each\nsource, aerosol optical depth and deposition to oceans for\neach source is indicated in Table 2. The derivation of the time\ntendency of each source region (Si(t)) is described next.\nFor the Southern Hemisphere sources, we rely to a large\nextent on the results of a recent modeling study (Li et al.,\n2008), since other studies are characterized by too large of\nan Australian source (Luo et al., 2003; Mahowald, 2007).\nWhile geochemical provenance studies can be valuable for\ndeducing the sources for different dust deposition sites, there\nis limited data (Grousset and Biscaye, 2005). For the\npresent climate, information on long-range dust provenance\nfor Antarctica is so far limited to the central East Antarc-\ntic Plateau, the main source being Argentina (Delmonte et\nal., 2007), with significant contribution from a secondary\nsource which could be either the Puna-Altiplano (Delmonte\net al., 2008; Gaiero, 2008) or Australia (Marino et al., 2008).\nFor the Antarctic cores, we chose our sources to be consis-\ntent with these model and observational studies (Table 3).\nSome paleorecords (e.g. West Antarctic Ice Sheet and Siple,\nTable 1) are associated with two different sources, and so\nAtmos.

For GISP (Donarummo et al., 2002) and Penny\n(Zdanowicz et al., 1998), the variability over the 20th cen-\ntury appears to be governed by transport and deposition to\nthe ice cores (Meeker and Mayewski, 2002), not necessar-\nily broad scale source or dustiness changes. Several trop-\nical cores (Quelccaya, Thompson et al., 1984; Huascaran,\nThompson et al., 1995; and Kilamanjaro, Thompson et al.,\n2002) are far downwind from the dust source areas, and at\nhigh elevations, and seem to represent the variability in dusti-\nness in remote regions (Mahowald et al., 2010), while here\nwe want to characterize the source changes for regions dom-\ninating large parts of the globe. We have no paleodata to\nconstrain the South African or East Asian sources, so we let\nthem remain constant over the time period considered here.\nThe dust data we use are from downwind of the source re-\ngions, which means that we are deriving the long range trans-\nported dust variability from different source regions. This is\nalso the fraction that will impact climate and biogeochem-\nistry the most because it is the fraction transported away from\nthe source regions. We recognize that the assumptions made\nhere will impact the results of our study and that more data\nwill determine whether these assumptions are valid or not.\nWe evaluate the uncertainties in our approach in Sect. 4.\nOnce we assign each paleorecord to be representative of a\nsource region, we average the relative dust deposition time\nseries for the paleodust records within one source region, to\nproduce one time series of variation for each source region\n(S(i)).\nPaleodata description\nWe include here mostly published data (Table 1), of which\nwe do not include a detailed description.

America (McConnell\net al., 2007)\nwe extrapolate prior to the 1950s (Cape Verde used for North\nAfrica), and several unpublished datasets. We describe these\nin more detail here.\nThe North African source is responsible for about half of\nthe atmospheric loading (Luo et al., 2003). For this source,\nwe only have data from a coral record at Cape Verde going\nback to the 1950s (Mukhopadhyay and Kreycik, 2008). This\ndust deposition data correlates well with both in situ concen-\ntration data observed at Barbados (Prospero and Lamb, 2003)\nand negative precipitation anomalies over the Sahel region\nof North Africa (Mukhopadhyay and Kreycik, 2008). In or-\nder to extend the North African record back in time, we use\ngridded observed temperature and precipitation data, which\nhas been converted to a Palmer Drought Severity Index (Dai\net al., 2004). There is a statistically significant correlation\n(r =\u22120.66, p< 0.0001) between the Palmer drought sever-\nity index for the Sahel region and the Cape Verde coral record\nfor the 1955\u20132000 time period. This relationship is slightly\nstronger than that seen between precipitation in the Sahel and\nthe coral record (r =\u22120.60, p < 0.0001). Using the slope\nbetween the PDSI and Cape Verde dust deposition record and\nthe observational-based estimates for the Palmer Drought\nSeverity Index going back to 1905, we extrapolate the dusti-\nness of the North African source back to 1905 (Fig. 1). We\ncould do the same analysis but based on the shorter in situ\nBarbados concentration data (1968 to 2000) (Prospero and\nLamb, 2003), and extrapolate a similar less dusty early part\nof the 20th century (Fig. 1). Using the Cape Verde dataset\nto extend back to 1905 estimates less change in North Africa\nthan the Barbados data would (Fig. 1).\nIn recent years, the correlation between precipitation and\nBarbados dust is not as robust as the precipitation is recov-\nering, but the dust is staying high (Mahowald et al., 2009).\nThis is consistent with land use change contributing to the\nvariability at Barbados (Mahowald et al., 2002), or other un-\nknown processes contributing to dust variability. If land use\nwere contributing to the dust variability at Barbados, it would\nimply a larger change in dust in North Africa than estimated\nhere (Fig. 1). A new observationally-based study suggests a\nlarge increase in dust coming from North Africa during the\n20th century, which they attribute to land use in North Africa\n(Mulitza et al., 2010). This study extends over many cen-\nturies, and also shows time periods where the inferred pre-\ncipitation correlates well with dust, while during other time\nperiods, there is an increase in dust, unrelated to climate,\nwhich they interpret as a contribution to dust from land use\n(Mulitza et al., 2010). There are issues with the interpretation\nof this data, since the small size particles that they interpret\nas riverine inputs could also be desert dust from farther up-\nwind, however the results of this new observationally based\nstudy support the large increase we see during the 20th cen-\ntury from North Africa.\nNext we describe the unpublished datasets used for this\nstudy. For the datasets from Law Dome, Gomez and the West\nAntarctic Ice Sheet Divide deep drilling sites, we used con-\ntinuous measurements of the rare earth element Cerium (Ce)\n(McConnell and Edwards, 2008) in shallow ice cores to de-\nvelop detailed records of continental dust concentration and\nflux. Ce is an ideal tracer because it derives almost entirely\n(>99%) from continental dust. Annual dust concentrations\nwere derived from 40 to 80 Ce measurements per year in the\ncores using an abundance of 0.000083 ngCe g\u22121dust.\nFor the Red Sea dataset, Helium-4 (4He) measurements\nwere carried out on annual growth bands of a Porites lutea\ncoral collected in the northern Red Sea from the Ras Mo-\nhammad National park at the southern tip of Sinai Penin-\nsula (27\u25e643\u2032 N, 34\u25e607\u2032 E). Previous studies have established\n4He to be an effective proxy for mineral dust in deep-sea\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 10875\u201310893, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/10875\/2010\/\nN. M.

The 4He record\ntherefore, provides a near-annual proxy record of dust de-\nposition in the Northern Red Sea during the 20th century.\nLarge fluctuations are observed in the depositional dust flux\nas measured in the Red Sea Porites coral. In general, dust\nfluxes in the first half of the 20th century are low compared\nto dust fluxes in the 2nd half of the 20th century, with the\nlowest dust fluxes occurring during the 1950\u2019s. Dust fluxes\nincrease during the late 1960\u2019s with pronounced peaks in the\n1970\u2019s and early 1980\u2019s.\n2.2 Model descriptions\nThe models used to estimate the impact of the changes in\ndesert dust are components of the Community Climate Sys-\ntem Model (Collins et al., 2006a). There are three sets of\nmodel simulations conducted: those with the dust model (a\ncombined atmosphere\/land model), the ocean model and the\nland model. We drive each of these model separately, instead\nof in a coupled mode, so that we can better understand the\nindividual responses from different model components.\n2.2.1 Dust model\nFor dust modeling, we use the Community Atmosphere\nModel\/Community Land Model (Collins et al., 2006b)\n(CAM\/CLM3.1), which includes sources, transport and\ndeposition of desert dust; dust simulations have been com-\npared to available observations (Mahowald et al., 2006a).\nThe dust module used here was described previously (Zender\net al., 2003a; Mahowald et al., 2006a). The model assumes\nthat dust is generated over unvegetated, dry soils, with strong\nwinds in regions where soil is easily erodible (Zender et al.,\n2003a). The easily erodible soils, or preferential source ar-\neas (Ginoux et al., 2001), are assumed here to be in regions\nwhere infrequent rains supply new sediment for entrainment\ninto the atmosphere (Zender et al., 2003b). One small change\nto the simulations from previous simulations is that the veg-\netation threshold is changed so that the leaf area index (LAI:\nsurface area of leaves over surface area of land) is averaged\nover all vegetation types within a grid box, and if the vege-\ntation is below 0.3 LAI, the source strength grows linearly.\nPreviously the vegetation threshold was at 0.1 LAI and cal-\nculated for each plant functional type. Since the vegetation\ntypes are assumed to overlap, the new approach is more con-\nsistent with the way vegetation is considered in the model.\nThe dust model simulations include increasing greenhouse\ngases and time varying anthropogenic aerosols over the his-\ntorical time period (1870\u20132000), using the same historical\nforcing as Flanner et al. (2009). The model simulations are\nconducted using a slab ocean model, and are simulated at\nT42 (roughly 2.8\u25e6\u00d7 2.8\u25e6 resolution).\nBy default the dust model allows changes in soil dryness\nand winds to vary the strength of the source with time. Be-\ncause the model includes fixed monthly average satellite de-\nrived vegetation (Bonan et al., 2002), the impact of changes\nin vegetation on dust source area is not included in this ver-\nsion of the model (Dynamic vegetation versions of this model\nsimulate surface albedo poorly (Sealy et al., 2010), so that the\ndynamic vegetation version of the model was not used). Sim-\nulations conducted over the 130 year historical time period\nwith no tuning of the dust sources were unable to capture the\nobserved variability in deposition (shown in Sect. 3.1). This\nis despite the fact that the model captures observed mean\nglobal surface temperature changes (as shown in the Sect. 3).\nNormally in this model, the entrainment of the dust into\nthe atmosphere (E(x,y,t) is a function of soil moisture\n(SM), leaf area index (LAI), snow cover (SNOW), friction\nvelocity (FV), and soil erodibility (SE) (see Zender et al.,\n2003a for a more detailed description). All but the last vari-\nable are time and spatially varying variables used or derived\nin the land model. The last variable (soil erodibility) is a spa-\ntially constant variable indicating the relative effectiveness\nof each grid box for causing dust generation (Zender et al.,\n2003b).\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/10875\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 10875\u201310893, 2010\n10880 N. M. Mahowald et al.: Observed 20th century desert dust variability\nE(x,y,y)= function(SM(x,y,t), LAI(x,y,t),\nSNOW(x,y,t), FV(x,y,t), SE(x,y)) (2)\nIn order to force our model to reproduce the observed\nchanges in deposition we add in a term proportional to our\ndeposition changes at each gridbox (derived above from the\npaleodata):\nEnew(x,y,t)=TD(x,y,t) \u00b7E(x,y,t) (3)\nThis means we use our estimated deposition variability as a\nmeasure of source strength variability, a reasonable assump-\ntion since deposition in source regions is dominated by the\nlocal source and one that allows us to make one map of time\nevolution at each point. On top of this, the model is still al-\nlowed to vary the source strength with stronger winds or drier\nsoils. We had planned to iterate to get the correct deposi-\ntion variability, but the deposition matched the observations\nwithin the large uncertainty, so no iteration was conducted\n(as shown in results Sect. 3).\nWe calculate the climate impact of the direct forcing of\ndust using the CAM\/CLM3.1, with a simple slab ocean\nmodel, which should include most of the effects of the ocean\nresponse to warming without the expense of a fully coupled\nocean model. However, there will be errors associated with\nour simplification of the ocean, especially with regards to\ndecadal time scale forcing of climate from oceans. Since\nwe use these simulations to interpret the difference between\nsimulations with and without dust, which is a smaller forc-\ning than anthropogenic forcing, these biases are unlikely to\nbe large. We conduct four ensemble members for the control\ncase with no dust direct radiative forcing, and three ensemble\nmembers with dust direct radiative forcing. All the model\ncases are forced with increasing greenhouse gas concentra-\ntions in the atmosphere, changes in sulfate, black carbon and\norganic carbon aerosols, and volcanoes, similar to previous\nstudies (Flanner et al., 2009).\nThe climate impacts of desert dust on direct radiative forc-\ning have been shown to reproduce the few available radia-\ntive forcing estimated based on observations (Yoshioka et\nal., 2007; Flanner and Zender, 2006; Flanner et al., 2007).\nDust in the atmosphere absorbs and scatters both long and\nshort wave radiation, and in the global net, tends to cool\nthe atmosphere in the dust model (Yoshioka et al., 2007).\nThe model simulation is similar to Yoshioka et al. (2007),\nbut small changes to the dust optical properties were made\nto better match observations (Flanner et al., 2009). Snow\nalbedo reduction from dust is treated in a similar manner as\nblack carbon, but with appropriate global-mean dust optical\nproperties (Flanner et al., 2007). The impact of including\ndust in this model has been compared to observations and\nanalyzed previously, although we did not have information\nabout the time series of variability in the 20th century (Ma-\nhowald et al., 2006b; Yoshioka et al., 2007). The response to\ndust in the atmosphere is a function of both the single scatter-\ning albedo of dust (e.g. Perlwitz et al., 2001) and the surface\nalbedo of the underlying surface (Bonfils et al., 2001; Sealy\net al., 2010). For our dust model simulations we are care-\nful to match available aerosol optical properties and radiative\nforcing observations as closely as possible (see Yoshioka et\nal., 2007).\n2.2.2 Biogeochemistry models\nThe CCSM incorporates an ocean biogeochemistry mod-\nule with three types of phytoplankton, zooplankton grazers,\nand major nutrient and iron cycling (Moore et al., 2006).\nThis model has been compared against available observa-\ntions (e.g. Doney et al., 2009). The simulations are run in\nthe ocean-only mode (Krishnamurty et al., 2009), and are\nspun up with the new preindustrial dust levels, estimated\nhere from observations at 1870\u20131890. The historical sim-\nulations (1870\u20132000) are integrated with a repeated annual\ncycle of atmospheric physics and are forced with dust de-\nposition computed from the monthly mean dust fluxes from\nLuo et al. (2003) combined with the variability derived from\nEq. (1) for each grid point and year. Two simulations are\nconducted, one with constant dust and constant solubility,\nand one with increasing dust (estimated here) and increas-\ning solubility of iron due to air pollution (Mahowald et al.,\n2009). Results of the impact on ocean biogeochemistry from\nincreases in the solubility of iron have previously been pub-\nlished (Krishnamurty et al., 2009). For the ocean biogeo-\nchemistry experiments, we ignore the physical forcing of\naerosols for this study, and focus on the biogeochemistry of\niron addition, because it is thought that is an important mech-\nanism (e.g. Martin et al., 1991).\nThe land biogeochemistry response is computed using the\nprototype version of the Community Land Model (CLM4)\nthat incorporates several updates relative to CLM3.5 (Oleson\net al., 2008) including a land biogeochemistry model (Thorn-\nton et al., 2007; Thornton et al., 2009). The biogeochemistry\nmodel includes N-colimitation, which will reduce the carbon\nuptake under higher CO2 conditions (Thornton et al., 2007),\nand a 2-leaf model for plant photosynthesis, which allows\nfor the inclusion of direct versus diffuse radiation effects on\nphotosynthesis (Thornton et al., 2007). The model is rela-\ntively insensitive to climate, with a small negative feedback\nof climate onto the carbon cycle (Thornton et al., 2009). The\nmodel is run offline using the hourly CAM generated climate\ndata (e.g. temperature, precipitation and insolation) based on\na control and a simulation including the dust radiative forc-\ning (from the above described simulations). The change in\ncarbon uptake and land productivity are estimated based on\nthe difference between simulations including dust radiative\nfeedbacks and excluding them.\nFor the land biogeochemistry experiments we focus on the\nphysical climate forcings, and ignore any biogeochemistry\nimpacts from direct aerosol deposition. The most important\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 10, 10875\u201310893, 2010 www.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/10875\/2010\/\nN. M.

For the climate simulations, we\ninclude several ensemble members to assess the uncertainty\ndue to variability in the simulations or interannual variability,\nwhich tends to be smaller than the uncertainty in the optical\nproperties (e.g. Miller and Tegen, 1998).\nWe also calculate the radiative forcing of the indirect\naerosol effect. Because of the large uncertainties in the in-\nteraction between aerosols and cloud properties (Forster et\nal., 2007), our model does not explicitly include indirect ef-\nfects. However, we can estimate the importance of these\nlarge changes in aerosol amount on the clouds based on es-\ntimates from the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange assessment report (IPCC) (Forster et al., 2007) and\nassuming that aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei in\nproportion to their aerosol optical depth (Rosenfeld et al.,\n2008). Observations suggest that aerosol optical depth is a\ngood proxy for cloud condensation nuclei, independent of\ntheir chemistry (Rosenfeld et al., 2008), because the num-\nber and size of particles is important (but not their mass).\nWhile desert dust particles are largely insoluble, they are hy-\ndrophilic (Koretsky et al., 1997), readily attracting condens-\ning water, and thus likely to be heavily involved in cloud\nformation (Rosenfeld and Nirel, 1996). In addition, desert\ndust particles could interact with ice nuclei (Sassen, 2002).\nWe do not have a model that includes these impacts. There-\nfore, to roughly estimate the indirect forcing from dust vari-\nability we: (1) divide the total aerosol indirect effect radia-\ntive forcing estimated in the last IPCC by the total change in\naerosol optical depth assumed in the IPCC, and (2) multiply\nthe result from (1) by the observed global average change in\naerosol optical depth estimated here. This can only be con-\nsidered a rough estimate of the indirect effect of desert dust\nchanges on climate.\nThe radiative forcing of the biogeochemistry impacts of\ndesert dust onto the land and ocean are calculated based on\nthe changes in atmospheric CO2 estimated from the biogeo-\nchemical models (Sect. 2.2) times the radiative forcing of\nCO2, based on Forster et al. (2007).\n3 Results\n3.1 Dust variability over 20th century\nOur estimates from the available paleorecords suggest signif-\nicant fluctuations in desert dust source strength from the dif-\nferent source areas over the 20th century (Fig. 2). There are\ndifferences in the deposition variability at the different core\nlocations that sample each source (Fig. 2), which implies sig-\nnificant uncertainties in our estimated trends (discussed in\nmore detail in Sect. 4). In our methodology, the differences in\ndeposition variability at different sites are assumed to come\nfrom variations due to transport-deposition relationships at\nthe individual sites. These results suggest that many of the\nmain desert dust sources were relatively less active during\nthe early part of the 20th century (all except North America,\nFig. 1a), and many increased with time, reaching a maximum\nin the 1980\u2019s, during the North African\/Sahel drought.\nThe reason for these changes in dustiness is not clear. Data\nsuggests that desert dust responds strongly to climate, ei-\nther regional variability such as due to the North African\ndrought (Prospero and Lamb, 2003) or global variability dur-\ning glacial\/interglacial cycles (Petit et al., 1999). While the\nland surface or inundated lakes are likely to be drying due to\nhotter temperatures and precipitation pattern shifts (Dai et al.,\n2004), carbon dioxide increases may make arid plants more\nable to deal with water stress (Smith et al., 2000). Because of\nthese potentially offsetting effects of humans, climate model\nbased estimates are inconclusive, suggesting that deserts may\nhave either expanded or contracted since the late 1800\u2019s (Ma-\nhowald, 2007). Desert dust also responds locally to agricul-\nture and pasture land use, since both remove the vegetation\nthat protects the soil against wind erosion (Gillette, 1988;\nNeff et al., 2005), but the global importance of land use is not\nknown (Tegen and Fung, 1995; Prospero et al., 2002; Tegen\net al., 2004; Mahowald et al., 2004; Yoshioka et al., 2005;\nMoullin and Chiapello, 2006; Mahowald et al., 2009). Wa-\nter use by humans could impact desert dust (Reheis, 1997),\nbut there is no evidence of large scale impacts from water\nuse (Mahowald et al., 2009). The results here suggest that\nthe net effect of climate drying, carbon dioxide fertilization\nand land use change by humans result in an increase in desert\ndust over the 20th century. This model was not able to sim-\nulate this variability without the source being forced to vary\nwith time (dotted line in Fig. 2). Note that we were unable to\nextrapolate our North African source farther back than 1905,\nso we do not estimate the desert dust amounts in the 19th\ncentury, required for a preindustrial to current climate con-\ntrast.\nAs discussed in the methodology section, the model was\nunable to capture the observed variability in dust deposi-\ntion without modification to the source strength. Once the\nsource strength is tuned using the relative deposition time\nseries derived in Eq. (1), the model deposition at the paleo-\nrecord sites capture the variability that we derived from the\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/10875\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem.

For this model, changes in dust trans-\nport are not important for the variability seen in the cores (at\nthe cores we include: see Sect. 2.1 for cores not included in\nthe data forcing the model, because transport\/deposition vari-\nability is thought to be important), even though large scale\nchanges in precipitation and temperature are simulated. This\nis consistent also with previous model studies (Tegen and\nMiller, 1998; Mahowald et al., 2003). This is even consistent\nwith the model studies of the last glacial maximum, where\nto get large changes (>25%) in dust deposition, changes to\nsource areas need to be included in some models (Mahowald\net al., 1999, 2006a). Some models obtain larger changes in\ndust source strength without changes in source area for the\nlast glacial maximum because of stronger winds and\/or dry-\nness (Andersen et al., 1998; Werner et al., 2002). Note that\nMahowald et al. (1999) and Werner et al. (2002) use different\nversions of the same climate model (ECHAM).\nThe model estimated aerosol optical depth, a measure of\nthe interference of the aerosols with incoming solar radia-\ntion, follows the variability in the source strength (Fig. 3b).\nThe relative contribution of each source area to the total\nsource, aerosol optical depth, and deposition to oceans for\nthe source provenance studies conducted with this model\nshow the dominance of the North African source for con-\ntrolling much of the climate impact of desert dust (Table 2).\nThe radiative forcing of the desert dust follows closely the\naerosol optical depth (Fig. 3b). The average direct radiative\nforcing of desert dust at the top of the atmosphere over the\n20th century is \u22120.5 W\/m2, and varies strongly with time\n(Fig. 3b). The net change between the relatively less dusty\nearly 20th century (1905\u20131914) and the dusty 1990\u20131999 re-\nsults in a direct radiative forcing of \u22120.07 W\/m2. The largest\nAtmos.

Mahowald et al.: Observed 20th century desert dust variability 10883\nchanges in radiative forcing occur between the dusty 1980\u2019s\n(1980\u20131989) and less dusty late 1950\u2019s (1955\u20131964), result-\ning in globally averaged differences in radiative forcing of\n\u22120.28 W\/m2 (Fig. 4a). For reference the current net anthro-\npogenic radiative forcing (from greenhouse gases and anthro-\npogenic aerosols, etc.) is estimated to be +1.6 W\/m2 (Forster\net al., 2007), signifying that the 20th century changes in di-\nrect radiative forcing due to fluctuations in desert dust are\nclimatically important (Fig. 4a).\nAs discussed in the methods, we are not able to include\nindirect effects of dust aerosols explicitly in this model, but\ninstead estimate the impact of dust onto clouds. We roughly\nestimate the impact of changes in desert dust on the radiative\nbudget through the indirect effect (described in Sect. 2.3),\nbut cannot include these impacts in the atmospheric mod-\neling study. A first order estimate of the radiative forcing\nfrom aerosol indirect effects from changing dust (Fig. 4a) is\n\u22120.36 W\/m2 for 1980\u20131989 vs. 1955\u20131964. The indirect ef-\nfect of dust changes is about the same size (and sign) as the\ndirect effect, so that including this response doubles our esti-\nmate of the 20th century \u201ccooling\u201d radiative forcing of desert\ndust.\n3.2 Climate and biogeochemical response\nThe climate impact of the dust is simulated using ensemble\nmembers including and excluding the direct radiative forcing\nof desert dust. The globally averaged net impact of includ-\ning desert dust direct radiative forcing on model climate is\na mean cooling of \u22120.12 \u25e6C. For comparison, when histor-\nical 20th century greenhouse gases trends and aerosols are\nused to force the model, the simulated temperature increase\nis +0.73 \u25e6C between the 1870s and 1990s (Fig. 3c). Although\nthe mean change between the early 1900s (1905\u20131914) and\nthe 1990s (1990\u20131999) just due to dust changes is not sta-\ntistically significant, there are larger impacts for some time\nperiods. The inclusion of desert dust changes in the model\nreduces the temperature rise between the relatively low dust\n1955\u20131964 time period and the high dust 1980\u20131989 time\nperiod by approximately 0.11 \u25e6C; this is about 1\/3 of the to-\ntal change between these two time periods simulated in the\nmodel (Fig. 3c), and this reduction in the rise in temperatures\nmakes the model more consistent with the observational data\n(Brohan et al., 2006) (Fig. 3c). If we focus on just the land\nsurface temperatures in the model (which the data represents\nbetter), the change in surface temperature between 1980\u2013\n1990 and 1955\u20131965 is 0.34 and 0.48 \u25e6C with and without\ndust, respectively, while the observations show a change of\n0.21 \u25e6C (Fig. 4b); again the model including the effects of\ndust changes matches the data better than without the effects\nof dust changes. Note that after this time period, the dust\nis reduced and the temperature rises again. In addition, the\ndust cools the atmosphere over desert regions, causes subsi-\ndence locally and moves precipitation away from desert dust\nregions (Yoshioka et al., 2007). Because most of the desert\ndust is in the Northern Hemisphere, this causes a decrease\nin Northern Hemisphere land precipitation in the tropics be-\ntween 1980\u20131989 compared to 1955\u20131964 (Fig. 4c), allow-\ning the model to better match observational estimates of the\nchange in precipitation (Dai et al., 2004) (Figs. 4c and 5).\nRegional changes in surface temperature, precipitation and\nsea level pressure, as simulated in the model for the 1980\u2013\n1989 dusty period compared to the 1955\u20131965 non-dusty\nperiod (Figs. 5, 6 and 7), suggest that the changes in re-\ngional climate from changes in dust are of the same order\nas from the changes due to other forcings (including CO2)\nfor this time period, especially for the case of precipitation.\nFor precipitation, we compare to available observations (Dai\net al., 2004) and demonstrate that with dust included in the\nmodel, even without forcing the ocean, we can capture much\nof the large-scale shifts in precipitation between the dusty\nperiod (1980\u20131989) to the non-dusty period (1955\u20131965).\nThis suggests that desert dust itself contributes to drought\nin the Sahel, for example, as argued previously (Yoshioka\net al., 2007). The response of precipitation to dust is sen-\nsitive to single scattering albedo (Perlwitz et al., 2001), and\nour model has been carefully compared to available obser-\nvations to show that it matches observed single scattering\nalbedo (Yoshioka et al., 2007). In order to compare the model\nsimulation to observations over oceans, we are restricted to\na few datasets. Comparisons to the mean sea level pressure\nestimates based on observations (Allan and Ansell, 2006),\nsuggest that including dust variability improves the compar-\nison with increased sea level pressure over North Africa and\nSouth Atlantic, but degrades the simulation over the South\nIndian Ocean.\nIn addition to these impacts of desert dust on climate,\ndesert dust can interact with biogeochemistry, and thereby\nimpact atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gas emis-\nsions. For this study we include the impact of increasing\ndust solubility from air pollution (Mahowald et al., 2009) as\nwell as changes in desert dust deposition, in a 3-dimensional\nmodel simulation of ocean biogeochemistry (Krishnamurty\net al., 2009) and obtain changes in net air-sea CO2 fluxes\n(Fig. 3d). Changes in dust deposition result in a 6% increase\nin ocean productivity and a significant perturbation to the\nnitrogen budget, through the reduction in iron limitation of\nthe nitrogen fixing organisms (Fig. 8). This results in an in-\ncrease in the uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean of 8 Pg C\n(equivalent to 4 ppm in atmospheric CO2) over the 130 years\nof the simulation (Figs. 3 and 8). This approximately dou-\nbles the impact of human perturbations on iron deposition to\nthe oceans simulated from changes in combustion processes\nonly (Krishnamurty et al., 2009). Notice that for this ocean\necosystem model, anthropogenic increases in the iron depo-\nsition to the ocean are more important than anthropogenic\nincreases in nitrogen deposition to the ocean (Krishnamurty\net al., 2009). The net effect of these changes in CO2 onto\nthe radiative balance for different time periods is shown in\nFig. 4.\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net\/10\/10875\/2010\/ Atmos. Chem.

The uncertainty envelope in radiative forcing (a)\ncomes from the uncertainty analysis in the Sect. 4, while in the uncertainty envelopes in the temperature and precipitation (b and c) represent\ninterannual variability (and ensemble members for the model).\nThe 20th century changes in desert dust can impact the\nability of the land biosphere to take up carbon dioxide by\naltering precipitation and temperature patterns (Jones et al.,\n2009), as well as by changing the amount and characteristics\nof the incoming solar radiation (Mercado et al., 2009). Us-\ning a land biogeochemistry model to simulate the impact of\nchanging dust on the land carbon cycle, we estimate a de-\ncrease in the land uptake of carbon over the 20th century,\nduring the transition from wetter to drier conditions due to\nthe increase of dust (Fig. 3d). Integrated over the 20th cen-\ntury, this results in 6 ppm (12 Pg C) more CO2 in the atmo-\nsphere in the 1990\u2019s, much of it coming out through a higher\nincidence of fires in a climate with changing dust (Fig. 3d).\nThe increased carbon dioxide concentrations will result in a\nwarming (more than offsetting the ocean uptake of carbon)\n(Figs. 3 and 4).

For (d) the grey color indicates\nwhere observations are available, but did not show a statistically significant result (grey is below the statistically significant level for the\nmodeled results).\nflux response to dust is surprisingly similar to the residual\nunexplained carbon fluxes deduced from atmospheric con-\ncentrations, land and ocean biogeochemistry models in a re-\ncent synthesis (LeQuere et al., 2009) (Fig. 3e). This temporal\ncovariance between the residual carbon flux and the flux as-\nsociated with desert dust suggests that much of residual car-\nbon flux may be associated with desert dust fluctuations. The\nmodel results suggest that as the land system moves from the\nrelatively less dusty 1955\u20131964 period into the more dusty\n1980\u20131989, there is a positive carbon flux from the land to\nthe atmosphere. However, caution should be used in inter-\npreting this comparison, since the precipitation shifts asso-\nciated with the desert dust should already be included in the\ndata used to drive the land biogeochemistry models used to\nderive the residual carbon flux.\nMuch of the change in terrestrial carbon occurs in the\nNorthern Tropics (0\u201320\u25e6 N) in the model (Fig. 8a). The\nspatial distribution of the land carbon anomalies suggests\nthat dust direct radiative forcing reduces productivity over\nlarge regions of the globe (Fig. 9a). Most of this reduction\nappears to be associated with changes in moisture availability\n(Fig. 9b), consistent with the shifts in precipitation predicted\nby the model (Fig. 6). This suggests that the shifts in precipi-\ntation are most important to these changes in land carbon up-\ntake, not changes in insolation (direct vs. diffuse) (Mercado\net al., 2009), but the sensitivity of the carbon uptake in this\nmodel to different forcings has not been tested rigorously.\n4 Uncertainty analysis\nWe estimate the uncertainty from each part of the analysis in\nthis paper.

For (d) the grey color indicates where\nobservations are available, but did not show a statistically significant result (grey is below the statistically significant level for the modeled\nresults).\nvariability in dustiness, we look at the variability in relative\ndeposition across the deposition sites that we assume repre-\nsent the same source. This uncertainty is estimated for the\nsources with the most paleodata records (Australia, South\nAmerica and the Middle East\/Central Asia) by calculating\nthe standard deviation in relative deposition at each time, and\nthen averaging this value over all times. This results in stan-\ndard deviations in relative deposition of 41%, 28% and 33%\nfor Australia, South America and the Middle East\/Central\nAsia, respectively. We assume that the true uncertainty in\nour time series of source variability (due to the lack of suffi-\ncient paleodatasets) is the highest of these (40%) for all our\nsource regions for all time.\nFor the radiative forcing calculation and the climate re-\nsponse estimates in the model, there is additional uncertainty\nassociated with the uncertainties in the optical properties of\nmineral aerosols. Based on the modeling studies included in\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), fo-\ncusing on those studies using single scattering albedos that\nmatch recent observations (Forster et al., 2007), we estimate\napproximately 20% uncertainty in the direct radiative forcing\nof dust. The climate response of the system to this radiative\nforcing appears to be to move precipitation away from the\ndust layer and cool surface temperatures in several model\nstudies using observed single scattering albedo (Yoshioka\net al., 2007). We thus assume that direct radiative forcing\nand climate responses to dust have an uncertainty of 40%\n(from source strength) plus 20% (from mineral aerosol opti-\ncal property uncertainties), totaling 60%.\nThe uncertainties in the indirect radiative forcing of the\nmineral aerosols are assumed to be the uncertainties asso-\nciated with the dust variability, as well as the uncertain-\nties associated with the indirect effect itself (+100%\/\u221250%)\n(Forster et al., 2007). In addition, we have not directly cal-\nculated the indirect effect, but rather estimated it based on\nanthropogenic aerosol results.

The modeled response to iron was highly\nvariable with uncertainties between 50\u2013100%. We assume\nhere an uncertainty of 60%, so that our total uncertainty in\nocean response is 100% (40% +60%). The ocean model-\ning does not include any physical climate impacts of aerosols\nonto the ocean biogeochemistry, and thus the uncertainty es-\ntimate may be an underestimate.\nFor the land uptake of carbon, the uncertainties come from\nthe dust variability (40%), the radiative forcing and climate\nresponse (20%), and uncertainties in different land model re-\nsponses to the same forcing. We use a study that looked at the\nclimate response for several carbon cycle models over 1958\nto 2002. Over these five models (all of which were carbon-\nonly models), the mean uptake is 83.2 PgC, with a standard\ndeviation of 16.6 PgC, or 20% different (Sitch et al., 2008).\nWe thus assume our uncertainty in land model uptake of car-\nbon from dust is 80% (40% + 20% + 20%).\nNotice that our uncertainties are large, and that much of\nthe uncertainties are associated with the change in dustiness\ndeduced from a relatively few paleodata sets. We include\nthese uncertainty estimates into our radiative forcing calcu-\nlations in Fig. 2.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nThis study represents a first attempt to reconstruct desert dust\nvariability over the 20th century based on observational and\nmodel synthesis. Our results have large uncertainties: much\nof the uncertainties are due to the sparse data available for\nthis time period, thus suggesting that more paleodata records\ncovering the recent past would improve our understanding\nAtmos.

The North African, East Asian and Middle East\/Central\nAsian sources are the most important, and least constrained,\nand thus should be the high priority for future observations.\nUsing established models, we estimate the climate and bio-\ngeochemical response from these changes in 20th century\ndust. There remain large uncertainties in the response to\ndesert dust in the models, due to uncertainties in desert dust\ndistributions, optical parameters, and indirect effects in the\natmosphere, as well as uncertainties in the ocean and land\nbiogeochemistry models and their responses to desert dust.\nWe do not consider important interactions such as the im-\npact of desert dust aerosols on air quality and health (Pros-\npero, 1999), and atmospheric chemistry (Dentener et al.,\n1996). We deal with the potential for indirect effect of\naerosols on climate with a simple, back of the envelope ap-\nproach, and do not consider the complete effects of indi-\nrect forcing as in a full, interactive model. In addition, the\nchanges in desert dust reconstructed here will impact the in-\ndirect effects of anthropogenic aerosols by providing addi-\ntional surfaces for condensation to occur on.\nOur results suggest that desert dust roughly doubled over\nthe 20th century over much, but not all the globe (Fig. 3a and\nb).
