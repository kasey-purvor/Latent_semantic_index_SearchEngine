Bishr Omary\nThe lens is an avascular tissue, separated from the aqueous and vitreous humors by its own extracellular matrix, the lens\ncapsule. Here we demonstrate that the lens capsule is a source of essential survival factors for lens epithelial cells. Primary\nand immortalized lens epithelial cells survive in low levels of serum and are resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis\nwhen they remain in contact with the lens capsule. Physical contact with the capsule is required for maximal resistance\nto stress. The lens capsule is also a source of soluble factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) and perlecan, an\nextracellular matrix component that enhances FGF-2 activity. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) inhibition as well as\nMMP-2 pretreatment of lens capsules greatly reduced the protective effect of the lens capsule, although this could be\nlargely reversed by the addition of either conditioned medium or recombinant FGF-2. These data suggest that FGF-2\nrelease from the lens capsule by MMP-2 is essential to lens epithelial cell viability and survival.\nINTRODUCTION\nCell survival requires the continued exposure to specific\nsurvival factors. In a classic study (Ishizaki et al., 1993), lens\nepithelial cells were shown to survive in culture, in the\nabsence of cell\u2013cell contact, as long as the right growth\nfactor cues were available. These factors could be provided\nexogenously either in the form of conditioned media or in\nserum supplement (Ishizaki et al., 1993), leading to the\nwidely accepted general hypothesis that cells are pro-\ngrammed to die unless the appropriate signals are received.\nThe recent proposal of the extracellular matrix (ECM)\nreservoir hypothesis suggests that the ECM itself can act as\na reservoir for growth and survival factors (Bergers et al.,\n2000; Mott and Werb, 2004) that are released via the action of\nvarious matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; reviewed in Mc-\nCawley and Matrisian, 2001; Mott and Werb, 2004). MMPs\nhave been shown to release fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2\n(MMP-1, -3; Whitelock et al., 1996) and fibroblast growth\nfactor receptor (FGFR)-1 (MMP-2; Levi et al., 1996), activate\ntransforming growth factor (TGF)-\u00011\/2 (Yu and Stamenk-\novic, 2000), and to both activate and release insulin-like\ngrowth factor (IGF)-1 (MMP-1, -2, -3, and -9; Fowlkes et al.,\n1994; and MMP-2, -3, and -7; Imai et al., 1997). MMPs are\ntherefore an essential component in this proposed role for\nthe ECM in cell survival and cell proliferation (Ishizuya-Oka\net al., 2000; Wiseman et al., 2003). From such data, we can see\nthat the ECM reservoir hypothesis requires three essential\ncomponents: an ECM, growth factors sequestered by the\nECM, and the presence of MMPs to release the growth\nfactors from the ECM. This hypothesis changes our percep-\ntion of the ECM as it can no longer be considered to solely\nprovide a physical support or appropriate cues for integrin\nsignaling (Hynes, 1992; Adams and Watt, 1993), but is also a\nsource of cell proliferation and survival factors (Klagsbrun,\n1990; Taipale and Keski-Oja, 1997; Bergers et al., 2000; Mott\nand Werb, 2004; Tran et al., 2004).\nThis reservoir hypothesis was proposed on the basis of\nstudies on angiogenesis and tumor progression. For in-\nstance, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release is\nnecessary for tumor progression by driving the activation of\nquiescent cells in the vasculature (Bergers et al., 2000), and\nMMPs were shown to increase the bioavailability of VEGFs\nneeded for this (Hashimoto et al., 2002). The ECM reservoir\nhypothesis clearly has implications for a broad range of\nother cell biological situations, including tumor metastasis\n(Fidler, 2002) and the establishment of stem cell niches (Rob-\nerts et al., 1988; Carter et al., 2004; Leone et al., 2005).\nIn the experimental systems used to propose the ECM\nreservoir hypothesis, the specific origin and site of growth\nfactor sequestration or even which cells produce the MMPs\n(Bergers et al., 2000; Wiseman et al., 2003) are hard to iden-\ntify. In many cases it is activities derived from other cells\nthat release growth factors from the ECM (Bergers et al.,\n2000; Mott and Werb, 2004). We decided, therefore, to ex-\namine the reservoir hypothesis of the ECM in a defined\nThis article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press\n(http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1091\/mbc.E06\u201305\u20130416)\non August 15, 2007.\n\u25a1D The online version of this article contains supplemental material\nat MBC Online (http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org).\nAddress correspondence to: Roy Quinlan (r.a.quinlan@dur.ac.uk).\n4222 \u00a9 2007 by The American Society for Cell Biology\nsystem, namely the eye lens epithelium and its associated\nECM, the lens capsule, because the lens can be isolated intact\nand free from other contaminating cells and tissues.\nIn this study, we show that the lens capsule maintains lens\nepithelial cell viability even in the presence of apoptogens.\nWe confirm that lens epithelial cells produce several MMPs\nincluding MMP-2, which releases FGF-2 from the lens cap-\nsule as proof of principle for the ECM-reservoir hypothesis\nin this system. MMP-2 is the most important MMP for\nepithelial cell viability in this system, and our data show that\nthis activity, in combination with FGF-2 release, are key\naspects to the survival of lens epithelial cells on the lens\ncapsule.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBovine Lens Capsule Processing\nWhole bovine eyes were obtained from Northern Counties Meat Group\n(Sunderland, United Kingdom). The lenses were dissected out of the eyes\nwithin\u000112 h after culling and left overnight in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole,\nUnited Kingdom) supplemented with 0.1% (vol\/vol) fetal calf serum (Sigma-\nAldrich), 2 mM l-glutamine, 200 U\/l penicillin, and 0.2 mg\/l streptomycin in\na 37\u00b0C, 5% (vol\/vol) CO2 incubator. The next morning, the lens capsules were\ndissected by placing the anterior capsule face-down and by cross-cutting and\npinning down the posterior capsule onto Sylgard-covered (Dow Corning,\nBarry, United Kingdom) wells of a 12-well plate, with the inside of the\ncapsular bag facing upward, after which the fiber mass was removed. When\nthese capsules were to be seeded with cells, the capsules were then\ntrypsinized for 1 h (trypsin-EDTA provided by Sigma-Aldrich), washed once\nin phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), once in 70% (vol\/vol) ethanol, and twice\nin PBS, after which they were left in PBS overnight in an incubator maintained\nat 37\u00b0C and 5% (vol\/vol) CO2.\nCells and Cell Lines\nThe cell line H36CE2 was established from the central epithelium of a lens\nfrom a 3-y-old postmortem donor who died in 1994. These cells were immor-\ntalized with SV40 Large-T antigen, expressed in adenovirus, as described\npreviously (Andley et al., 1994; Kleinjan et al., 2001). Karyotype characteriza-\ntion was undertaken (Rooney and Czepulkowski, 1992) and was in broad\nagreement with previously published data for a SV40 Large-T antigen im-\nmortalized lens epithelial cell line, B3 (Andley et al., 1994). RT-PCR confirmed\nthat the H36CE2 cells retained a lens epithelial cell phenotype (\u0002A-crystallin,\n\u0002B-crystallin, and FoxE3 positive). RNA was extracted from the cells using the\nGenElute Mammalian Total RNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich), and cDNA was gen-\nerated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Superscript First strand\nsynthesis system, Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom). Primary bovine lens\nepithelial cells were removed from lens capsules by trypsinization, seeded\nonto plastic dishes, and grown in DMEM supplemented with glutamine,\npenicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (vol\/vol) FBS.\nCell Viability Studies\nCells were seeded at a concentration of 50,000 cells\/ml in 12-well plates with\nor without a lens capsule covering the bottom of the well. Cells were cultured\nin high serum (10% [vol\/vol] fetal calf serum) or low serum (0.1% [vol\/vol]\nfetal calf serum) supplemented media. Viable cell number was determined at\nvarious time points after seeding, by the one-step CellTiter 96 Aqueous\nNonRadioactive Cell proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Southampton, United\nKingdom) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, after a change of\nmedia, 100 \u0003l of reagent was added to 500 \u0003l of media in the presence of the\ncells and left for 90 min after which media samples were read on an ANTHOS\nLUCY1 plate reader (Anthos Labtec Instruments, Leighton Buzzard, United\nKingdom) at 490 nm and absorbance values recorded. Staurosporine was\nadded 48 h after seeding to allow cells to adjust to their respective substrates.\nMMP inhibitors were added at the time of seeding the cells to prevent all\nMMP-ECM interactions from the start of the experiment. Staurosporine\n(Tamaoki et al., 1986; Oncogene Research Products, Nottingham, United\nKingdom) was used at 0.5 \u0003M (protein kinase A [PKA] IC50 \u0002 7 nM, PKC\nIC50 \u0002 0.7 nM, PKG IC50 \u0002 8.5 nM), OA-Hy (Emonard et al., 1999; Calbio-\nchem, Nottingham, United Kingdom) at 100 \u0003M (Ki \u0002 1.7 \u0003M) and MMP\ninhibitor II (Pikul et al., 1998; Calbiochem) at 5 nM (MMP-1 IC50 \u0002 24 nM,\nMMP-3 IC50 \u0002 18.4 nM, MMP-7 IC50 \u0002 30 nm, and MMP-9 IC50 \u0002 2.7 nM).\nThe concentration chosen for the MMP inhibitor II is selective for MMP-9 (see\nIC50 values above), whereas the concentration chosen for the OA-Hy has been\nshown to be selective for MMP-2 inhibition (Polette et al., 1999), which we\nhave confirmed independently by zymography (data not shown).\nTUNEL Studies\nCells were cultured in high serum (10% [vol\/vol] fetal calf serum) sup-\nplemented media with or without 0.5 \u0003M staurosporine on either glass\ncoverslips or bovine lens capsules cleaned of all primary cells. After 48 h,\ncell apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining (terminal dUTP nicked-\nend labeling) and propidium iodide counterstaining (Boehringer-Mann-\nheim, Lewes, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.\nApoptotic Morphology Quantification\nCells were cultured on either glass coverslips or bovine lens capsules cleaned\nof all primary cells. Cell culture conditions were high serum (10% [vol\/vol]\nfetal calf serum) supplemented medium with or without 0.5 \u0003M staurospor-\nine. After 48-h exposure to staurosporine, cells were fixed in 4% wt\/vol\nparaformaldehyde and stained with DAPI (1 \u0003g\/ml in PBS) in order to\nvisualize the nuclei. They were then mounted in Citifluor and examined with\nfluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Welwyn Garden\nCity, United Kingdom). The capsules were mounted by being placed, cells-up,\nonto a microscope slide. The coverslips or capsules were examined, and cells\nwere counted under 40\u0003 magnification until either a total of 1000 cells had\nbeen counted or until 100 fields had been examined, whichever came first.\nEach cell counted was scored as either normal or apoptotic (with compressed\nand\/or fragmented chromatin; i.e., a pyknotic nucleus). The number of apo-\nptotic nuclei was then expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells\ncounted. Three independents repeats were made for each data point, and the\nsignificance of the results gathered was assayed by \u00042 test.\nCoculture and Conditioned-Media Experiments\nIsolated bovine lens capsules were cleaned of cells as described above. For the\ncoculture experiments, a capsule was placed in the bottom chamber of the\nwell in a 12-well plate as required. A semipermeable membrane insert (Fal-\ncon\/Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, United Kingdom) was added to each well,\ngiving a top chamber, which contained a coverslip seeded with 12,500 cells.\nThis cell number was calculated to reflect the difference between the surface\narea of the coculture insert compared with the area of the lower well to ensure\nthat the starting cell density remained constant for both chambers. For the\nconditioned-media experiment, lens capsules were kept in low serum (0.1%\n[vol\/vol] fetal calf serum) supplemented media for 72 h. In some instances,\nthe lens capsules were pretreated with 80 ng of human recombinant MMP-2\nin low serum media (R&D Systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom). These\nconditioned media were sometimes added back to fresh lens capsules. Cell\nviability was monitored by the one-step CellTiter 96 Aqueous NonRadioac-\ntive Cell proliferation Assay kit (Promega) as described above.\nCell Cycle Analysis\nH36CE2 cells were cultured in 10% (vol\/vol) fetal calf serum-supplemented\ncell culture medium on either uncoated plastic dishes or bovine lens capsules\nthat had been cleaned of all primary cells, at a seeding density of 50,000 cells\nper well. After 48 h, the cells were processed for cell cycle analysis following\nthe CyStain DNA 2step (PARTEC, M\u00fcnster, Germany) protocol. Briefly, cells\nwere detached with trypsin, spun down for 5 min at 1000 rpm, and then\nresuspended in nuclear extraction buffer and left at room temperature for 20\nmin, after which cells were spun down for 10 min at 1000 rpm, fixed in cold\n70% ethanol, and left at \u000420\u00b0C until batch analysis. Immediately before\nanalysis, cells were spun down and resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer\nand then left at room temperature for 10 min, before addition of the staining\nsolution. Samples were run on a FACSAria flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson)\nand analyzed using a 60 mW UV laser. Doublets were discriminated against\nusing Area versus Width of the 450-nm signal from DAPI. Data were ana-\nlyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR), and the G1, S, and G2\nratio was determined by the Watson (pragmatic) method provided within the\nFlowJo software.\nReal-Time Analysis Using TaqMan Low-Density Arrays\nRNA was extracted from the cells using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA\nkit (Sigma-Aldrich) and cDNA generated according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Superscript First-strand Synthesis System, Invitrogen). TaqMan\nlow-density array (LDA) enables quantitative real-time PCR in a 384-well\nlow-density array. Pre-designed TaqMan primers and probes sets for 48 target\ngenes were chosen from an on-line catalogue (http:\/\/www.appliedbiosystems.\ncom\/) and manufactured by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Each array\ncontained eight sample ports, with each feeding 48 reaction wells. LDAs were\nrun according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, each sample port was\nloaded with 100 \u0003l PCR mix (100 ng of total RNA converted to cDNA and 2\u0003\nTaqMan Universal PCR mix; Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling condi-\ntions were as follows: 50\u00b0C, 2 min; 94.5\u00b0C, 10 min; 40 cycles of 97\u00b0C, 30 s; and\n59.7\u00b0C for 1 min and were performed on the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence\ndetection system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, United Kingdom). Ex-\npression levels of target genes were normalized to GAPDH. Data were\nanalyzed using 7900HT system and SDS software. The cycle threshold (Ct)\nvalue reflects the cycle number at which the fluorescence generated within a\nreaction crosses the threshold. Gene expression values were calculated based\nMMP-2 Maintains Lens Epithelial Cell Viability\nVol. 18, November 2007 4223\non the \u0005Ct method where \u0005Ct represents the Ct of the target minus that of\nGAPDH. Due to the exponential nature of PCR, \u0005Ct was converted to linear\nform using the equation: 2\u0004(\u0005Ct), to give the relative quantity of the target\ngene expression. The amplification efficiencies associated with TaqMan gene\nexpression assays designed by ABI are equal and thus allow expression levels\nof target genes to be compared with values obtained for cells grown on plastic\nbeing used as the baseline.\nImmunoblotting\nImmunoblotting was used to confirm the presence of gelatinases in condi-\ntioned medium from H36CE2 cells grown on plastic and on the lens capsule.\nConditioned media samples were collected after 96-h culture and concen-\ntrated 25-fold using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifuge filter with a 30K nominal\nmolecular weight limit (Millipore, Molsheim, France) as described elsewhere\n(Fuchshofer et al., 2003). For MMP-2 detection the culture medium used was\nserum-free to prevent bovine serum albumin (BSA) obscuring the MMP-2\nsignal. For MMP-9 detection, the culture medium used was supplemented\nwith 0.1% (vol\/vol) serum in accordance with the rest of our experiments.\nSamples were separated for 1 h at 200 V on a 12% (wt\/vol) acrylamide gel and\nblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) for 2 h.\nThe membrane was washed in blocking buffer (5% [wt\/vol] milk in TTBS) for\n1 h at room temperature, after which the membrane was incubated in the\nprimary antibody solution overnight at 4\u00b0C, rinsed twice, and incubated with\nthe secondary antibody solution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After further rinsing, the\nmembrane was incubated for 5 min in the dark in enhanced chemilumines-\ncence (ECL) solution, and the image was collected using a cooled CCD camera\nsystem (Fujifilm Intelligent Dark Box II, Tokyo, Japan). Images were pro-\ncessed using the companion computer program LAS-1000 and Adobe Photo-\nshop CS (San Jose, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to MMP-2 and MMP-9\n(clone 101724 and 4H3, respectively; R&D Systems) were used that detect\nboth latent and active forms of these MMPs. Human recombinant latent\nMMP-2 and MMP-9 (R&D Systems) were used as positive controls.\nImmunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy and Scanning\nElectron Microscopy\nBovine lens capsules that had been cleaned of all primary cells as described\nabove were treated with 80 ng of recombinant human MMP-2 (R&D Systems)\nper capsule for 72 h in substrate buffer (5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0). For\nimmunofluorescence microscopy analysis, 10-\u0003m frozen sections were made\nusing a Leica CM3050S cryostat (Milton Keynes, United Kingdom), and\nsections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 1%\nNP40 in PBS for 15 min, and blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS for 20 min.\nPrimary polyclonal anti-FGF-2 (clone PC16, Calbiochem) and monoclonal\nanti-perlecan (clone A7L6, Chemicon) antibodies were used. Secondary anti-\nbodies used were TRICT anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and fluorescein\nisothiocyanate (FITC) anti-mouse IgG (Scottish Antibody Production Unit,\nCarluke, Scotland). Pictures were taken using a Bio-Rad Microradiance con-\nfocal microscope coupled to Lasersharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nLtd., Hemel Hampstead, United Kingdom). For scanning electron microscopy\nanalysis, whole lens capsules were fixed in 2% gluteraldehyde in PBS over-\nnight, washed two times for 10 min in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4,\nincubated in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4 for 1 h,\nwashed 10 min in water, dehydrated through ethanol series (50, 75, 90, 95,\n100, and 100%, 5 min each), critical point-dried with CO2, and coated with 5\nnm platinum in a Cressington 308 coater. They were then viewed in a Hitachi\nS-5200 feSEM at 10 kV accelerating voltage.\nELISA Measurement of Growth Factor Levels\nFGF-2 ELISA (R&D Systems) was conducted according to manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. The assay measured both free and bound FGF-2 forms. Samples\nconsisted either of unconcentrated medium taken from BLEC and H36CE2\ncells grown on lens capsules in 0.1% (vol\/vol) serum for 48 h or of uncon-\ncentrated substrate buffer (5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0) taken from lens\ncapsules that had been cleaned of all cells and exposed to human recombinant\nMMP-2 for 72 h.\nData Analysis\nThe absorbance values recorded using the one-step CellTiter 96 aqueous\nnonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) and the ELISA kit (R&D\nSystems) were converted into viable cells number and growth factor level,\nrespectively, using standard curves for each cell line and growth factor,\nrespectively. Six wells were used for each treatment per experiment. The data\nfrom three independent experiments were pooled, and the mean and SE of the\nmean calculated for each treatment. Significance between treatments was\ndetermined by an independent-sample, two-tailed t test, and pairwise com-\nparisons were made, with a significance level set at 0.05.\nRESULTS\nThe Lens Capsule Protects Lens Epithelial Cells against\nSerum Deprivation and Staurosporine-induced Apoptosis\nPrevious experiments conducted with human lens explants\nhave shown that lens epithelial cells kept within the capsular\nbag can proliferate in the total absence of serum (Wormstone\net al., 1997), whereas lens epithelial cells grown on a plastic\nsubstrate undergo apoptosis when deprived of serum\n(Wang et al., 1999). In low levels of serum (0.1% [vol\/vol]\nserum), primary bovine lens epithelial cells, BLEC, and im-\nmortalized human lens epithelial cells, H36CE2, attached\nwith equal efficiency to both plastic dishes and bovine lens\ncapsules, as shown by the measurement of cell number 1 h\nafter plating (Figure 1A). After 96-h exposure to 0.1% (vol\/\nvol) serum, however, no BLEC and H36CE2 cells survived\nwhen plated onto plastic dishes (Figure 1B, pl-0.1% FCS). In\ncontrast, cells plated onto bovine lens capsules were readily\ndetected (Figure 1B, cap-0.1% FCS).\nThese data suggested that the lens capsule protected the\nlens epithelial cells against cell death in low levels of serum.\nTo test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of the bo-\nvine lens capsule to protect lens epithelial cells against stau-\nrosporine-induced apoptosis in the presence of 10% (vol\/\nvol) serum. In this experiment, the ability of staurosporine to\nkill cells grown on the plastic culture dishes (Figure 2, A and\nB, pl-c, pl-s) was compared with those cells grown on lens\ncapsules (Figure 2, A and B, cap-c, cap-s). On plastic, there\nwas a dramatic decrease in cell number in both cell lines\nafter 48 h of staurosporine treatment (Figure 2, A and B, pl-c\nand pl-s). When cells were grown on the lens capsule sub-\nstrate, however, significantly less cell loss was observed\n(Figure 2, A and B, cap-c and cap-s). In fact the BLEC cells\neven appeared to be insensitive to staurosporine treatment\n(Figure 2A, cap-c and cap-s), perhaps reflecting the primary\norigin of these cells compared with the large T antigen\u2013\nimmortalized H36CE2 cells. In agreement with these cell\nviability results, when BLEC cells were TUNEL stained,\nthose treated for 48 h with staurosporine in 10% (vol\/vol)\nmedium resulted in the detection of apoptotic DNA damage\nfor cells grown on glass coverslips (Figure 2, C and D), but\nnot for cells grown on the lens capsule (Figure 2, E and F).\nQuantification of apoptotic damage, by counting the per-\nFigure 1. Lens epithelial cells are protected against\nserum deprivation when cultured on the lens capsule.\nBLEC and H36CE2 cells were seeded onto either plastic\ndishes (pl) or lens capsules (cap) in 0.1% (vol\/vol) fetal\ncal serum (FCS). After 1 h in culture (A), there was no\nstatistical difference (p \u0006 0.05 for both BLEC and\nH36CE2) between the numbers of cells attached to the\nlens capsule or to the plastic dishes (bars show the\naverage number of cells attached to the lens capsules as\na percentage of the average number of cells attached to\nthe plastic dishes). After 96 h in culture (B), viable cells\nwere only detected on the lens capsules (cap). Those on plastic (pl) appeared not to have survived.\nF.M.D. Tholozan et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell4224\ncentage of pyknotic nuclei in BLEC cells grown in high\nserum (10% [vol\/vol]) medium in the presence of stauro-\nsporine for 48 h, showed a significantly greater number of\napoptotic nuclei in cells cultured on coverslips, rather than\non lens capsules (Figure 2G). These results strongly suggest\nthat the lens capsule is capable of preventing staurosporine-\ninduced apoptosis in lens epithelial cells.\nTo test whether the lens capsule had a solely antiapoptotic\neffect, rather than a mixture of proproliferative and anti-\napoptotic activities, we subjected H36CE2 cells grown on\neither uncoated plastic dishes or bovine lens capsules to cell\ncycle analysis. After 48 h culture in 10% (vol\/vol) serum-\nsupplemented cell culture medium, only a small, nonsignif-\nicant increase in the G2 population was observed in H36CE2\ncells grown on the lens capsules, compared with H36CE2\ncells grown on plastic (Table 1), suggesting that the presence\nFigure 2. Lens epithelial cells are protected against staurospo-\nrine-induced apoptosis when cultured on the lens capsule. (A\nand B) BLEC cells (A) and H36CE2 cells (B) were grown on either\nuncoated plastic dishes (pl-c) or on bovine lens capsules (cap-c)\nin 10% (vol\/vol) serum and then challenged with 0.5 \u0003M\nstaurosporine (pl-s; cap-s). After 48-h exposure to staurosporine,\nmost of the BLEC (A, pl-s) and H36CE2 (B, pl-s) grown on the\nplastic dishes did not survive compared with controls (A, B; pl-c\nand pl-s; p \u0001 0.05 for both BLEC and H36CE2). When grown on the\nlens capsules (A and B, cap-s), there was, however, a smaller de-\ncrease in cell number (A and B; cf. cap-c and cap-s; p\u0006 0.05 and p\u0001\n0.05 for BLEC and H36CE2, respectively). (C\u2013F) Immunofluores-\ncence microscopy of BLEC cells labeled with both propidium iodide\n(red) and TUNEL staining (green) and grown on either glass cov-\nerslips (C and D) or on bovine lens capsules (E and F) in the absence\n(C and E) or presence (D and F) of 0.5 \u0003M staurosporine in media\ncontaining 10% (vol\/vol) serum. After 48 h in the presence of\nstaurosporine, chromatin reorganization was frequently observed in\nthe nuclei of cells grown on glass as detected by propidium iodide\nstaining. These propidium iodide\u2013positive nuclei were also largely\nTUNEL-positive, indicating that significant DNA damage has also\noccurred, as indicated by the yellow color of their nuclei (arrows). In\ncontrast, cells grown on the bovine lens capsule were mostly not\nTUNEL positive and chromatin reorganization was also not usually\nseen (F). Scale bars, 10 \u0003m. (G) BLEC cells grown on either glass\ncoverslips (gl) or on bovine lens capsules (cap) in the absence (-c) or\npresence (-s) of 0.5 \u0003M staurosporine in media containing 10%\n(vol\/vol) serum were labeled with DAPI and then scored for the\npresence of apoptotic nuclei. The number of apoptotic cells after\n48-h exposure to staurosporine was then expressed as percentage of\ntotal cell number as described in Materials and Methods. In the\nabsence of staurosporine, the percentage of apoptotic cells was low\nfor cells grown on both glass (gl-c) and lens capsule substrates\n(cap-c). With the addition of staurosporine, cells grown on the\ncoverslips exhibited a very large increase in the number of apoptotic\ncells (gl-p and gl-s; p \u0001 0.05). In contrast, cells grown on the lens\ncapsule exhibited a much smaller increase in number of apoptotic\ncells (cap-s).\nTable 1.

The percentages of cells within the G1 and S populations\nwere similar for both substrates, with a small, nonsignificant (\u00042 test;\np \u0006 0.10) increase in the G2 population when H36CE2 cells were\ngrown on bovine lens capsules. Numbers shown are the average \u0007\nSD of three independent repeats.\nMMP-2 Maintains Lens Epithelial Cell Viability\nVol. 18, November 2007 4225\nof the lens capsule per se does not strongly affect the cell\ncycle of lens epithelial cells.\nMMPs Are Expressed by Lens Cells\nOthers have reported that lens epithelial cells grown on the\nlens capsule produce matrix metalloproteinases, and specif-\nically MMP-2 and -9, when exposed to stress (Tamiya et al.,\n2000). To investigate whether this expression pattern would\nbe conserved in our system, RNA was isolated from the\nhuman H36CE2 cells grown for 48 h in 0.1% (vol\/vol) serum\non bovine lens capsules and uncoated plastic dishes, and the\nexpression profile for ADAMTS-1 to -20, MMP-1 to -28 and\nTIMP-1 to -4 were monitored by a TaqMan gene expression\nassays (representative result shown in Supplementary Fig-\nure 1). GAPDH was used to normalize the expression levels\nfor the two values, and then the relative change in RNA\nlevels for the cells grown on the lens capsule versus the\nplastic were plotted on a log scale (Figure 3A). These data\nconfirmed the presence of MMP-2 and also identified\nMMP-1, -3, -14, and -15 as expressed by H36CE2 cells grown\non both substrates. Only ADAMTS-4 and MMP-2, however,\nwere consistently up-regulated in cells grown on the lens\ncapsules compared with cells grown on plastic, and MMP-9\nwas not detected for cells grown on either substrate (Figure\n3A). The expression of the inhibitors TIMP-1 and -4 (Brew et\nal., 2000) were also consistently down-regulated in cells\ngrown on lens capsules compared with those grown on\nplastic (Figure 3A). The presence and activation status of\nMMP-2 was checked by immunoblotting of lens cell condi-\ntioned media after 48 h of culture in serum- free medium\n(Figure 3B). The pro-MMP-2 form (72 kDa) and to a lesser\nextent its active cleaved (57 kDa) form were present in the\nmedia from H36CE2 cells grown on plastic dishes. Condi-\ntioned media from cells grown on the capsule contained\npredominantly the cleaved 57-kDa active form of MMP2.\nAgain, MMP-9 was not detected (Figure 3C) confirming the\nRNA expression data. Collectively, these data show that\nculture of lens epithelial cells on the lens capsule correlates\nwith higher levels of MMP-2 expression and activation.\nSoluble Survival Factors Are Released from the Lens\nCapsule\nThe presence of active MMP-2 suggested that ECM degra-\ndation products could be released from the lens capsule to\nenable the survival of the lens epithelial cells. To address\nthis question, we cultured H36CE2 with lens capsules using\na coculture chamber system containing 0.1% (vol\/vol) se-\nrum supplemented media. Here, the H36CE2 cells were\ngrown in an upper chamber, separated by a semipermeable\nmembrane from a lower chamber. Various additions were\nmade to the lower chamber, such as H36CE2 cells only\n(Figure 4; Coculture; with cells in bottom chamber; no cap),\na lens capsule alone (Figure 4; Coculture; no cells in bottom\nchamber; plus cap) or H36CE2 cells grown on a lens capsule\n(Figure 4; Coculture; with cells in bottom chamber; plus\ncap). After 48 h in culture, comparing the treatment cell\nviability values to those for the controls (Figure 4; Controls;\npl, cap) showed H36CE2 cell number to be highest when\nboth lens capsule and cells were present in the bottom\nchamber (Figure 4; Coculture; with cells in bottom chamber;\nplus cap). These data suggest that soluble factors can be\nreleased by attached cells from the lens capsule to maintain\nthe viability of H36CE2 cells in the upper chamber in low\nserum conditions. This improved survival was, however,\nstill significantly less than that of H36CE2 cells grown in\ndirect contact with the lens capsule (Figure 4; Controls; cap).\nTherefore, maximal lens cell viability in low-serum condi-\ntions requires both physical attachment to the lens capsule\nas well as the release of soluble factors from the matrix.\nFigure 3. MMP-2 expression and activation are increased in\nH36CE2 cells grown on the lens capsule compared with H36CE2\ncells grown on plastic. (A) Analysis of the TaqMan gene expression\narray data plotted as relative change (\u0005\u0005Ct) in transcript levels\nbetween extracts from an equal number of cells cultured for 48 h on\nthe lens capsule (bars) and the plastic substrate (baseline). These\ndata show that H36CE2 cells grown on the lens capsule consistently\nexpress more ADAMTS-4 and MMP-2 and less TIMP-1 and - 4 than\nH36CE2 grown on plastic. MMP-9 mRNA expression was not de-\ntected. (B and C) Conditioned medium from H36CE2 cells grown on\nthe plastic (pl) and the lens capsule (cap) for 48 h were concentrated\nby centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence\nof MMP-2 (B) and MMP-9 (C). Human recombinant latent gelati-\nnases (hrMMP-2 and -9; asterisks) were included as standards.\nMMP-2 was detected in the medium from cells grown on both\nsubstrates in serum-free medium. Serum-free medium was used to\nprevent BSA from obscuring the MMP-2 protein signal after sample\nconcentration. In medium from the lens capsule cultures, MMP-2\nwas predominantly detected as the cleaved active form (upper\narrowhead; B) with a further cleaved minor form (lower arrow-\nhead), whereas in medium from plastic cultures MMP-2 was mainly\ndetected in the latent form (asterisk). MMP-9 was not detected in\nmedium from cells grown on either substrate in 0.1% (vol\/vol)\nserum conditions.\nF.M.D. Tholozan et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell4226\nFGF-2 Is Released from the Lens Capsule by MMP-2\nTo test whether MMP-2 could release growth factors from\nlens capsules, human recombinant MMP-2 (R&D Systems,\nMinneapolis, MN) was added to bovine lens capsules which\nhad been cleaned of cells beforehand and the presence of\ngrowth factor in MMP-2-treated capsules (Figure 5, A\u2013D)\nwas investigated. FGF-2 (McAvoy and Chamberlain, 1989;\nLe and Musil, 2001), IGF-1 (Piatigorsky et al., 1973; Shirke et\nal., 2001), and TGF-\u00012 (Luetteke et al., 1993; Weng et al., 1997)\nhave all been demonstrated as important for lens cell growth\nand differentiation. As visualized by immunofluorescence\nmicroscopy (Figure 5, A\u2013D), even after 72 h of exposure in\nsubstrate buffer, FGF-2 and its binding partner perlecan\n(Roghani et al., 1994; Venkataraman et al., 1994; Padera et al.,\n1999) were concentrated at both inner and outer faces of the\nanterior lens capsule (Figure 5, A and B) and could be\nreleased with MMP-2 treatment (Figure 5, C and D). Levels\nof released FGF-2 were significantly increased in the pres-\nence of human recombinant MMP-2, as detected by ELISA\n(Figure 5E). In contrast, no significant IGF-1 or TGF-\u00012\nrelease by MMP-2 were detected by ELISA measurements of\nconditioned buffer (data not shown). Also after 72-h expo-\nsure, scanning electron microscopy of the inner surface of\nthe anterior lens capsule showed that the main morpholog-\nical features of the lens capsule were retained after MMP-2\ntreatment, although the finer filamentous organization was\nlost (Figure 6, A and B). These data suggest that the lens\ncapsule contains a reservoir of FGF-2 at the cell-ECM inter-\nface that can be released as a result of MMP-2 activity.\nSubsequently, MMP inhibitors, and specifically MMP-2 in-\nhibitors, should reduce the levels of FGF-2 released from the\ncapsule by lens cells. A selective MMP-2 inhibitor was used\nto test this hypothesis. Inhibition of MMP-2 reduced the\nlevels of FGF-2 released into the medium for BLEC and\nH36CE2 cells grown on lens capsules in 0.1% (vol\/vol)\nFigure 4. Both attachment and soluble factors are involved in\nH36CE2 cells viability on the lens capsule. Controls, the maximum\ncell viability potential of H36CE2 cells grown directly on both\nplastic (pl) and the lens capsule (cap) was measured after 48 h in\n0.1% (vol\/vol) serum conditions. Coculture experiments, the effect\nof the lens capsule upon H36CE2 cell viability was measured in a\ncoculture system in 0.1% (vol\/vol) serum. In this coculture system,\nH36CE2 viability was measured for cells grown on an insert con-\ntained within a plastic dish well. This allowed for different combi-\nnations of lens capsule and H36CE2 cells to be added to the bottom\nchamber and for the effect of soluble factors upon the viability of the\nH36CE2 cells grown on the well insert to be determined. After 48 h\nin culture, in the absence of both cells and lens capsule in the bottom\nchamber, H36CE2 viability was very similar to that seen for the\nplastic control (cf. Coculture; \u2018no cells in bottom chamber; no cap\u2019\nwith Controls; pl; p \u0006 0.05). Adding a lens capsule to the bottom\nchamber in the absence of any additional cells in this compartment\nwas also unable to increase significantly the base level of cell via-\nbility for H36CE2 cells in the upper chamber (cf. Coculture, \u201cno cells\nin bottom chamber, plus cap\u201d with Controls, pl; p \u0006 0.05). In\ncontrast, adding both a lens capsule and H36CE2 cells to the bottom\nchamber significantly increased H36CE2 cell viability in the upper\nchamber (cf. Coculture, \u201cwith cells in bottom chamber; plus cap\u201d\nwith Controls; pl; p \u0001 0.05). The addition of H36CE2 cells alone to\nthe bottom chamber had no significant effect upon the viability of\nH36CE2 cells in the upper chamber (cf. Coculture, \u201cwith cells in\nbottom chamber; no cap\u201d with Controls, pl; p \u0006 0.05).\nFigure 5. MMP-2 can release lens capsule-bound FGF-2 and per-\nlecan and affect the amount of FGF-2 accessible to cells grown on the\nlens capsule. MMP-2 treatment of the lens capsule depletes capsule-\nbound perlecan and FGF-2 stores. (A\u2013D) Bovine lens capsules\ncleaned of all primary cells were exposed to human recombinant\nMMP-2 for 72 h in substrate buffer (5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl,\npH 8.0) and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. In\nthe untreated lens capsules, perlecan (green; A) and FGF-2 (red; B)\nwere still concentrated at the outer and inner faces of the anterior\nlens capsule. In MMP-2\u2013treated lens capsules, both layers were\nlargely depleted [perlecan (green; C) and FGF-2 (red; D)]. Scale bars,\n20 \u0003m. (E) Bovine lens capsules cleaned of all primary cells were\nexposed to human recombinant MMP-2 for 72 h in substrate buffer\n(5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0), and levels of FGF-2 released into\nthe medium were measured by ELISA. In the treated samples, levels\nof FGF-2 released into the medium were significantly increased with\nthe addition of human recombinant MMP-2 (p \u0001 0.05). (F) FGF-2\nrelease from the lens capsule by H36CE2 and BLEC cells is reduced\nby MMP-2 inhibition. H36CE2 cells and BLEC cells were seeded\nonto lens capsules in 0.1% (vol\/vol) FCS-supplemented medium\nand challenged with 100 mM OA-Hy as a selective inhibitor of\nMMP-2. After 48 h, MMP-2 (cap-c: cap-2inh) inhibition resulted in\nsignificant decreases in FGF-2 levels released into the medium as\nmeasured by ELISA (p \u0001 0.05 for both BLEC and H36CE2).\nMMP-2 Maintains Lens Epithelial Cell Viability\nVol. 18, November 2007 4227\nserum for 48 h (Figure 5F; cap-c and cap-2inh). Taken to-\ngether, these data show that there are significant levels of\nFGF-2 sequestered in the lens capsule, which can be released\nby MMP-2.\nMMP-2 Inhibition Decreases Lens Epithelial Cells\nViability\nThe effect of selectively inhibiting MMP-2 upon epithelial\ncell viability was determined (Figure 7). After 48 h in 0.1%\n(vol\/vol) serum conditions, MMP-2 inhibition (Figure 7, A\nand B, cap-2inh) significantly reduced the viability of both\nH36CE2 cells and BLEC cells. MMP-2 inhibition, however,\ndid not prevent the initial attachment of H36CE2 cells to the\nlens capsule (data not shown). To test whether the lens\ncapsule store of growth factors could be fully depleted by\nMMP-2, we pretreated lens capsules with human recombi-\nnant MMP-2 in 0.1% (vol\/vol) serum for 72 h before cell\nseeding (Figure 7, A and B, cap-2pre). This treatment very\neffectively inhibited the viability of both primary bovine lens\nepithelial cells (Figure 7A) and H36CE2 cells (Figure 7B).\nAgain, initial attachment of H36CE2 cells to MMP-2 pre-\ntreated lens capsules was not severely affected (data not\nshown). The conditioned medium collected from the MMP-\n2\u2013treated capsules could partially prevent cell loss due to\nMMP-2 inhibition (Figure 7, A and B, cap-2inh\bCM).\nMMP-9 inhibition was also tested and was shown to have no\neffect on either H36CE2 or BLEC cell viability after 48 h in\n0.1% (vol\/vol) serum conditions (Figure 7C). Taken to-\ngether, these results suggest that MMP-2 is the most impor-\ntant MMP for sustaining lens cell viability and that its effects\nare mediated by soluble factors (e.g., FGF-2) released from\nthe lens capsule.\nReaddition of FGF-2 Counteracts the Inhibition of\nEpithelial Cell Proliferation by MMP-2\nThese data suggest that it should be possible to reverse the\neffects of MMP-2 inhibition by simply providing media sup-\nplemented with FGF-2, if this growth factor were key to lens\nepithelial cell survival (McAvoy and Chamberlain, 1989;\nRichardson et al., 1993; Le and Musil, 2001; Lovicu and\nMcAvoy, 2001). Supplementing the growth media of pri-\nmary bovine lens epithelial cells with exogenous recombi-\nnant FGF-2 in the presence of the selective MMP-2 inhibitor\nOA-Hy, restored\t70% of the proliferation level after 48 h in\n0.1% (vol\/vol) serum conditions (Figure 7D). These data\nconfirm that MMP-2 and FGF-2 are key components in\npromoting lens epithelial cell stress resistance on the lens\ncapsule.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Lens Capsule Generates a Microenvironment\nConducive to Epithelial Cell Stress Resistance\nIn this study, we describe the role for the lens capsule as an\nECM store of FGF-2, a growth factor required for lens epithelial\ncell proliferation, migration and differentiation (Robinson,\n2006), most likely via MAPK signaling (Lovicu and McAvoy,\n2001; Iyengar et al., 2007). The data presented here provide\nevidence of the protective role of this ECM store of FGF-2 in a\nsimple, well-defined experimental system that mimics the mi-\ncroenvironment of the lens after surgery or injury (Wormstone\net al., 1997; Tamiya et al., 2000). We have identified MMP-2 as a\nmajor activity required to support lens cell viability, via the\nrelease of FGF-2 from the lens capsule.\nIt has long been recognized that the ECM determines cell\nproliferation and survival via integrin attachment and activa-\ntion (Matter and Ruoslahti, 2001; Hynes, 2002). Indeed the\ncross-talk between integrin signaling and growth factor recep-\ntors (Schwartz and Ginsberg, 2002) is a clear indication of the\nimportance of both pathways to cell proliferation, survival, and\ndifferentiation. The three-dimensional features of the ECM and\nits stiffness provide additional cues to the microenvironment\nthat influences cell proliferation (Lo et al., 2000; Bissell et al.,\n2002; Zahir and Weaver, 2004). Our data show that maximal\ncell number is achieved only when the cells are in direct contact\nwith the lens capsule (Figure 4). These are essential features of\nthe ECM role in cell proliferation and differentiation, but\ngrowth\/survival factors also play an equally important role as\npreviously shown using the lens epithelial cell paradigm (Ish-\nizaki et al., 1993). Our data extend these seminal studies by\nidentifying the lens capsule as a major source of the growth\/\nFigure 6. MMP-2 treatment affects the surface architecture of the\nlens capsule.

In other systems, FGF-2 is able to induce gela-\ntinase expression (Kohn et al., 1995; El Ramy et al., 2005;\nWang et al., 2005), suggestive of a positive feedback loop\nbetween growth factor release and the expression\/activation\nof MMPs to support lens epithelial cell survival and main-\ntain proliferation. Our data have also demonstrated how\nimportant the physical contact with the lens capsule is to\nenhance the effects of the released growth factors (Figure 4).\nFigure 7. MMP-2 mediates lens epithelial cell viability via the\nrelease of soluble factors from the lens capsule. (A and B) BLEC (A)\nand H36CE2 (B) cells were grown in 0.1% (vol\/vol) serum on lens\ncapsules that had been exposed previously to human recombinant\nMMP-2 for 72 h (cap-2pre). After 48 h in culture, this pretreatment\ncaused a significant decrease in cell viability (A and B: cap-c and\ncap-pre; p \u0001 0.05 for both BLEC and H36CE2). This decrease was\nnot significantly different from the decrease in cell viability obtained\nwhen either BLEC or H36CE2 cells were exposed to the MMP-2\nselective inhibitor OA-Hy for the 48-h culture time (A and B: cap-c\nand cap-2inh; p \u0001 0.05 for both BLEC and H36CE2 and A and B:\ncap-2pre and cap-2inh; p \u0006 0.05 for both BLEC and H36CE2). The\naddition of conditioned medium from MMP-2 pretreated lens cap-\nsules (CM) to either BLEC or H36CE2 cells grown on lens capsules\nin the presence of MMP-2 selective inhibitor OA-Hy (A and B:\ncap-2inh\bCM) partially reversed the decrease in lens epithelial cell\nviability induced by the addition of selective MMP-2 inhibitor (A\nand B: cap-2inh and cap-2inh\bCM; p \u0001 0.05 for both BLEC and\nH36CE2, and A and B: cap-c and cap-2inh\bCM; p \u0006 0.05 and p \u0001\n0.05 for BLEC and H36CE2, respectively). (C) Exposure to MMP\ninhibitor II as a selective MMP-9 inhibitor failed to decrease the cell\nviability of either BLEC or H36CE2 cells grown on lens capsules in\n0.1% (vol\/vol) serum (cap-c and cap-9inh; p \u0006 0.05 for both BLEC\nand H36CE2). (D) BLEC grown on the lens capsules were exposed\nto 100 \u0003M MMP2-selective inhibitor OA-Hy (cap-2inh) in 0.1%\n(vol\/vol) serum-supplemented medium. The subsequent decrease\nin cell viability (cap-c and cap-2inh) could be significantly, but not\ncompletely, reversed by the single addition of recombinant FGF-2\n(200 pg\/ml; cap-2inh and cap-2inh\bFGF, p \u0001 0.05, and cap-c and\ncap-2inh\bFGF, p \u0001 0.05).\nFigure 8. The MMP-ECM-Growth factor (MEG) cycle for cell via-\nbility. The presence and activity of MMP-2 in the lens cells\u2019 envi-\nronment, likely after integrin-mediated gene transcription as de-\nscribed for other systems (Troussard et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2005),\nleads to the degradation of HSPGs in the ECM, allowing soluble\nFGF-2 release into the media. FGF-2 then binds its receptor and\nactivates downstream signaling pathways (Lovicu and McAvoy,\n2001; Chandrasekher and Sailaja, 2003; Iyengar et al., 2007) to pro-\nmote cell survival. This represents the simplest form of the cycle and\ndoes not exclude contributions from other proteinases, cryptogenic\nECM sites, and IGF-1 and TGF-\u00012 release that can all influence\nepithelial cell survival. In other systems, FGF-2 can feedback to\nincrease gelatinase expression (El Ramy et al., 2005; Wang et al.,\n2005).\nMMP-2 Maintains Lens Epithelial Cell Viability\nVol. 18, November 2007 4229\nIn other systems, recent studies have suggested that MMP-2\ngene expression could be induced via AP-1 after ILK acti-\nvation after integrin engagement (Troussard et al., 1999; Lee\net al., 2005). It is the combination of these physical cues, the\navailability of growth factors from the ECM and the produc-\ntion of MMPs that support lens cell proliferation. We pro-\npose therefore the MEG cycle (MMP-ECM-Growth factor) to\naccount for our observations.\nLens epithelial cell stress resistance requires MMP-2\nOthers have reported the presence of MMP-2 in lens cells\ngrown on the lens capsule (Wormstone et al., 2002), with\nthe induction of both MMP-2 and -9 being conditional on\nthe addition of exogenous growth factors (Wormstone et\nal., 2002) or oxidative stress (Tamiya et al., 2000). Both\nMMPs are implicated in the TGF-\u0001\u2013induced epithelial-\nmesenchyme transition (EMT) of lens epithelial cells\n(Dwivedi et al., 2006). In our model, we have demon-\nstrated that the presence of MMP-2, but not MMP-9, is\nessential for lens epithelial cell resistance to serum depri-\nvation on the lens capsule. The MMP-2 selective inhibitor\nOA-Hy significantly inhibited epithelial cell viability,\nwhereas a selective MMP-9 inhibitor had no effect (Figure\n7). Also, pretreatment of bovine lens capsules with human\nrecombinant MMP-2 for 72 h was sufficient to reduce cell\nviability very effectively (Figure 7). Neither MMP-2 inhi-\nbition nor MMP-2 pretreatment prevented cell attachment\nto the lens capsule, although cell loss was detected as\nearly as 6 h after the start of both treatments (Figure 7).\nThis suggests that attachment to the substrate per se is not\nsufficient to guarantee the long-term survival of lens cells\non their ECM. MMP-2 processing of the lens capsule and\nthe subsequent release of soluble factors is also needed.\nMMP-2 inhibition significantly reduced the levels of\nFGF-2 in conditioned media (Figure 7), but the decrease in\nprimary lens cell number was largely reversed by adding\nrecombinant FGF-2 (Figure 7). These data demonstrate the\nimportance of FGF-2 to lens cell survival, but they also\nsuggest that MMP-2 has other targets and activities in this\nsystem because FGF-2 readdition did not completely re-\nverse OA-Hy inhibition. At this stage, we cannot exclude\ncontributions from other MMPs expressed by lens cells\n(Figure 3 and Supplementary Data). Also, the capsule\ncould contain low levels of other, as yet uncharacterized,\nproteinases with the potential to release these growth\nfactors, which in combination would influence lens cell\nsurvival, proliferation, and differentiation (Liu et al.,\n1996). The bio-context of FGF-2 availability could also\ninfluence its effect, because heparan sulfate proteoglycans\n(HSPGs) that facilitate FGF-2 binding to its receptor\n(Roghani et al., 1994; Venkataraman et al., 1994; Padera et\nal., 1999) are also potential substrates for MMP-2 (Fowlkes\nand Winkler, 2002). HSPs are important components of\nthe lens capsule (Azuma and Hara, 1998) and altering\ntheir biosynthesis can cause both lens hypoplasia and\nanophthalmia (Pan et al., 2006). Indeed, MMP-2 is also\nknown to activate latent cytokines, such as IL1-B and\nTNF-\u0002 (Fowlkes and Winkler, 2002) and most recently\nbeen shown to proteolyse and release E-cadherin, promot-\ning EMT in lens epithelial cells exposed to TGF-\u0001\n(Dwivedi et al., 2006). It can also alter the ECM microen-\nvironment to reveal cryptic proliferative sites in laminin\nand collagen (Pirila et al., 2003) and generate \u201cmatrikines\u201d\nfrom processed ECM molecules (Tran et al., 2004). Al-\nthough we have not identified which of these possibilities\nare most relevant here, we have shown that FGF-2 is\nreleased from the lens capsule by MMP-2, and both are\nrequired to protect lens epithelial cell from stress on the\nlens capsule. These data also support the ECM-reservoir\nhypothesis (Bergers et al., 2000; Mott and Werb, 2004) and\nconfirm that the lens capsule contains a store of accessible\nFGF-2.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Dr. Carol English (Northern Region Genetics Service, Institute of\nHuman Genetics, University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 3BZ,\nUnited Kingdom) for the cytogenetic analyses of the human lens epithelial cell\nline, Ian Dimmick (North East England Stem Cell Institute, International\nCenter for Life, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 3BZ, United Kingdom) for the cell\ncycle analyses of the human lens epithelial cell line, and Northern Counties\nMeat Group (Gateshead, NE10 0QH) for the supply of bovine material.
