INTRODUCTION\nThe perception of the cardiovascular system as a set of noisy coupled oscillators1 has opened new possibilities\nin the analysis of signals derived from it, e.g. of the cardiac and respiratory functions, blood flow and blood\npressure. At least five oscillatory processes can be identified. Their relative amplitudes, and the strengths of the\ninteractions between them, have obvious potential to illuminate the underlying physiological processes giving\nrise to the oscillations, and hence to give early warning of abnormalities perhaps corresponding to the onset of\ndisease.\nWe describe below an analysis of changes in oscillatory behaviour associated with congestive heart failure.\nWe measure patients\u2019 cutaneous blood flow, and assess the effects of two different iontophoretically delivered\nvasodilators: acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The vasodilating actions of ACh and SNP\nare respectively endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent, so that comparison of the increases in\nblood flow oscillatory amplitudes effected by each enables an assessment of endothelial reactivity. The wavelet\ntransform is used to separate the oscillatory components at different frequencies and, in particular, to assess the\nrelative energy content at \u223c0.01 Hz which is known2 to be associated with endothelial function. Measurements\nhave been completed on 17 congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, for each of them on two separate separate\noccasions: (a) on first diagnosis, prior to the initiation of treatment; and (b) several weeks later, after stabilisation\non treatment with a \u03b2-blocker. In each case, cutaneous blood flow was measured with and without the ACh and\nSNP. The ECG, respiration, and blood pressure were simultaneously recorded. Identical measurements have also\nbeen made on a control group of age-matched healthy subjects.\nTreatment of CHF is now orientated towards a long term reparative strategy that aims favourably to alter the\nbiological properties of the failing heart.3 This is dramatically illustrated by recent successes in the treatment\nof mid- to moderate-CHF with \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents.4, 5 \u03b2-blockers have been shown to reduce heart\nCorrespondence to: p.v.e.mcclintock@lancaster.ac.uk\nPublished in Fluctuations and Noise in Biological, Biophysical and Biomedical Systems \nIII, eds.

At the same time, CHF is characterised by peripheral vascular problems\nincluding systemic vasoconstriction6 and reduced regional blood flow,7 where the effect of \u03b2-blockers is not\nknown. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in regulating blood flow by releasing relaxing and constricting\nfactors, a role that has been shown to be impaired in CHF.8\u201310 Various technologies are available to evaluate\nendothelial function, like plethysmography or laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) that monitor vasodilatory responses\nto the administration of an endothelial-dependent vasodilator such as acetylcholine (ACh). A decreased response\nto ACh but not to the endothelial-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is considered evidence of\nendothelial dysfunction. Besides basal differences in responses to these two substances, one can study oscillatory\ncomponents in the blood flow.11\u201313 Using this technique, we further hypothesise that the difference in endothelial\nreactivity of the CHF group and an age-matched healthy control (HC) group will be manifested in particular\noscillatory components. The central hypothesis motivating our study is that, besides regularisation of the heart\nrhythm, \u03b2-blockers have a beneficial effect on endothelial responsiveness in CHF.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS\nPatients for the CHF group were recruited from the Morecombe Bay heart failure cardiology clinic register.\nInclusion criteria were that they should be in Class III or IV of the NYHA classification. Exclusion criteria\nincluded: hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, or any vascular medications. Healthy control subjects were\nrecruited from the local community and screened by history and examination, including ECG. After the CHF\npatients had been treated with Bisoprolol (a \u03b2-blocker), and their dosage had been titrated up to their maximum\ntolerated, they were remeasured, now as the \u03b2\u2013CHF subject group. All participants gave their informed consent\nin writing. The investigation conformed with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and was\napproved by the Local Ethics Committee of the Morecombe Bay Hospitals Trust. Titration.\nWe asked subjects to lie down on a bed and relax for 15 minutes prior to making continuous, simultaneous,\nmeasurements of: peripheral blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF); heart rate, using a conventional\n3-lead ECG; respiration, using a Biopac respiratory effort transducer placed around the thorax; blood pressure,\nusing a piezo-electric pulse plethysmograph placed on a finger; and temperature, using a sensitive fast-acting\nthermometer placed on the skin. The temperature of the room was maintained at 21\u00b12 oC. For the present\nstudy, only the blood flow measurements were used directly but the other recordings helped us to guard against\nthe occurrence of systematic errors during the period of measurement. Recording lasted for 30 minutes, chosen\nas a compromise between making the time series as long as possible, in order to optimize the statistical quality\n11.5\n2\nH\nR\n (H\nz)\na\n** **\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nR\nF \n(H\nz)\nc\n*\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nH\nR\n v\nar\nia\nbi\nlity\n (H\nz)\n*\nb\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nR\nF \nva\nria\nbi\nlity\n (H\nz)\n*\nd\nHC CHF CHF\u2212\u03b2\nFigure 2.

Two channels of a Moor\nInstruments Ltd (Axminster, UK) DRT4 LDF monitor were used in conjunction with probes (Moor MPI\u2013V2)\nmounted within iontophoresis chambers (Moor MIC1\u2013IONlr). Measurements were made on the volar aspect of\nthe right forearm, choosing areas of skin that were free from blemishes. To avoid possible systematic bias, we\nattempted to position both probes in areas with similar vasculature and without any larger vessels visible in their\nvicinity; the two chambers were placed randomly relative to each other for each subject, and for every recording.\nDifference in response to ACh and SNP found in the two lowest frequency intervals (see below) are therefore\nmost unlikely to result from chance; the difference at 0.01 Hz had already been consistently demonstrated in\nseveral study groups of different age.1, 11, 13 Near-infra-red light (wavelength 780 nm) was delivered to the probes\nvia a nearly loss-free optical fibre. The back-scattered light was collected and returned to the floLab monitor\nvia another optical fibre, where it was converted to an analogue electrical signal. The cut-off frequency of the\nlow-pass filter was 22.5 kHz, and an output time constant of 0.1 s was selected. Signals were digitized at 400 Hz\nwith 16-bit resolution by use of a National Instruments PCI-6035E A\/D converter, and stored in a personal\ncomputer. The LDF probes were calibrated against the flux standard provided by Moor Instruments in order to\nallow comparison of different signals and the blood flow was expressed in arbitrary units (AU).\nThe two vasodilators differ in that the action of ACh is endothelium-dependent whereas that of SNP, a direct\nNO donor, is endothelium-independent. The difference in the blood flow enhancements that they produce in\nany oscillatory component is thus related to the responsiveness of the vascular endothelium.11\u201313 The 1% ACh\nand SNP solutions were prepared on the day of the study in each case. They were drawn through the cutaneous\nbarrier at each of the LDF measuring sites by means of a constant electrical current of 100 \u00b5A derived from a\nMoor Instruments MIC1-e current controller. The iontophoresis current was applied in 7 pulses of 20 s, with\na separation of 240 s between each, as indicated in Figure 1a. Examples of blood flow changes for a healthy\nsubject in response to the ACh and SNP are shown in Figure 1b,c, illustrating the large increase of oscillatory\nactivity that typically occurs in addition to the increased average flow.\n3. DATA ANALYSIS\nThe time averages of the signals from the LDF probes (originally sampled at 400 Hz) were calculated, and the\nsignals were then resampled at 10 Hz using a moving average technique. Trends were removed by giving the\nmoving average a window length of 200 s, thereby eliminating frequencies below 0.005 Hz. Following this pre-\nprocessing, we applied the wavelet transform (using the Morlet mother wavelet) to analyse the frequency content\nof the signals. The advantage compared to conventional Fourier techniques is the logarithmic abscissa, enabling\nan extremely wide range of frequencies to be accommodated: in the present case, the characteristic frequencies\ndiffered by a factor of more than 100\u00d7. In analysing the data, we have found evidence for activity in a frequency\ninterval lower than those previously reported, centred on 0.007 Hz. In what follows, we will refer to the latter as\nthe \u201clowest frequency interval\u201d.\nWe use two measures to quantify the contribution of the oscillations to the total blood flow: their average\namplitude, calculated over the whole frequency interval and within the subintervals; and the normalized ampli-\ntude, defined as the ratio between the average amplitude within a given subinterval and the average amplitude\nover the whole frequency interval (0.005\u20132.00 Hz). A nonpaired, nonparametric, Wilcoxon rank sum test was\nused to obtain the probability that two distributions are equal. The value p < 0.05 was considered to imply a\nstatistically significant difference. The graphical data that follow below are presented in each case as a box with\nlines drawn at the 10th pencentile, the median and the 90th percentile. Whiskers extend from the ends of the\nbox to the most extreme data value within 1.5\u00d7IQR (where IQR is the inter-quartile range of the box). Outlying\ndata falling beyond the whiskers\u2019 range are marked with a +. Pairs of distributions with 0.01 < p < 0.05 are\nasterisked; where p < 0.01 a double-asterisk is used.\n4. RESULTS\nFigure 2 summarises the heart and respiration statistics for the three subject groups. In the CHF group, heart\nrate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are significantly increased as compared to the age-matched HCs. The\nincreased HRV is mainly on account of ectopic beats. \u03b2-blockers evidently cause a significant decrease in HR\nbut not in HRV. The respiration frequency (RF) was defined as the reciprocal of the interval between successive\nrespiration maxima, averaged over 30 minutes. Both RF and respiration frequency variability (RFV) were\nsignificantly increased in CHF patients as compared to the HC group. Neither RR nor RFV were significantly\naffected by the treatment with \u03b2-blockers.\nFigure 3a shows the effect of ACh and SNP on the mean flows in HC and CHF groups, and Figure 3b shows\ntheir effect on the total spectal amplitude. There are highly significant differences in the mean flows between\nthe two subject groups, in their responses to both ACh and SNP. However, there are no statistically significant\ndifferences between them in the total spectral amplitudes of their responses to ACh and SNP.\nWith added frequency discrimination, it becomes evident that almost all the oscillatory components are\naffected by CHF, but that the impairments of the lower frequency ones in CHF patients are only seen with ACh\n(and not with SNP). There is a clear distinction between the CHF and HC groups in their spectral amplitudes\nin response to ACh in the lowest frequency interval, but not in response to SNP. The same is true of their\nnormalised amplitudes.\nThe effect of \u03b2-blockers has been analysed, comparing the responses to ACh and SNP for all three subject\ngroups. The most significant comparisons are again in the lowest frequency interval. Here, there is a highly\nsignificant difference in the responses to ACh and SNP on the part of the HC group in terms of both spectral\namplitude and normalised amplitude. There is no statistically significant difference for spectral amplitude in\nthe case of the CHF patients, but there is a significant difference in their normalised amplitudes. Following\ntreatment with \u03b2-blockers, however, the CHF-\u03b2 group exhibits differences in response to ACh and SNP that are\nstatistically highly significant, both in the spectral amplitude and in the normalised amplitude.\nACh SNP\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n**\n**\nM\nea\nn \nflo\nw \n(A\nU)\na\nACh SNP\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTo\nta\nl s\npe\nct\nra\nl a\nm\npl\nitu\nde\nb\nHC CHF\nFigure 3. The effects of ACh and SNP on the mean blood flow and total spectral amplitude for the CHF and HC subject\ngroups.\n5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe fact that the lowest frequency peak is affected by ACh but not SNP in the HC group can be taken as evidence\nthat, like the peak at 0.01 Hz, it is associated with endothelial function. Our results clearly demonstrate that\nthe responsiveness of the vascular endthelium in CHF patients is reduced, as compared to the HC group. This\nfinding is consistent with the recent observation10 by Morgan et al of decreased endothelial responsiveness in the\nlarger vessels of CHF patients. The latter authors were also investigating elderly patients, and also using ACh\nand SNP. Their study involved invasive techniques for the measurement of average flows, without the frequency\ndiscrimination possible in studies of oscillations. All of the patients were receiving medication, so there was no\nopportunity to study changes resulting from treatment.\nThe differing responses of the CHF and CHF-\u03b2 groups found in the present study show clear evidence that\ntreatment with Bisoprolol brings an increase in endothelial responsiveness in the lowest frequency interval: the\nACh\/SNP differentiation in spectral amplitude for untreated CHF patients is statistically insignificant whereas,\nfor the CHF-\u03b2 group it is statistically highly significant. A similar pattern is evident for changes in the normalised\namplitude in the lowest frequency interval, where a statistically significant ACh\/SNP differentiation in the CHF\ngroup becomes highly statistically significant in the CHF-\u03b2 group following treatment. Treatment with Bisoprolol\nevidently ameliorates the impairment of endothelial responsiveness associated with CHF. There is clear potential\nfor routine clinical use of LDF, coupled with iontophoretic delivery of ACh and SNP and frequency analysis, in\nthe assessment of a CHF patient\u2019s endothelial reactivity, and for quantification of the extent to which a more\nnormal response can be restored by treatment with Bisoprolol.\nA full account of this work, together with the detailed frequency analyses of the results, will be presented\nelsewhere.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Alexander Balanov, Natalia Janson, Mark Lippett and Yuri Shiogai\nin recording the data.
