R&CA\u2019s  leadership  of  the  industry  had  been  strengthened.  The  Certified Professional  Restaurateur  Program  had  helped  to  raise  the  recognition  of business and management skills in the industry. R&CA worked productively with regulators on issues such as food safety and with the ABS to develop more accurate measures of the industry. These activities contributed to greater recognition of the industry by government and others. \u00b7  Education,  employment  and  training  objectives  were  also  addressed  with R&CA being involved in the development of training packages. A report, the Waiting is Over, was an input to the National Skills Shortages Strategy. A pilot assessment tool was developed to screen individuals for aptitude in the hospitality industry. Work was also done on a Labour Agreement with the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Citizenship. In these areas,  been little has filtered down to business in the industry. \u00b7  Marketing and promotion were also addressed: An Australian Food and Wine Atlas  was  published,  the  Savour  Australia  brand  developed,  with  links  to awards for excellence and restaurant accreditation. A study of the Australian dining  out  market  was  commissioned  and  R&CA  contributed  to  the development  of  the  Wine  and  Food  Tourism  Joint  National  Plan,  in partnership  with  Tourism  Australia  and  the  Winemakers  Federation  of Australia.   49 \u00b7  The  technology  and  innovation  outcomes  of  the  Action  Agenda  were  less successful. This area was arguable the most challenging, given that nature of the  industry  and  the  generally  low  levels  of  technology  up-take  by restauranteurs.  The  technology  roadmap  developed  provided  several recommendations  in  relation  to  point  of  sale  technology,  which  have  been progressed. Further consideration of how other aspects of the industry could benefit from innovation is recommended in the post-RCIAA period. Impact on Tourism Industry \u00b7  As above. Other Impacts \u00b7  No other impacts have been identified. Key Lessons Strengths \u00b7  Action Agendas were a relatively low cost, broad coverage mechanism for industries to develop strategic directions. \u00b7  The Action Agenda has been successful in building leadership and cohesion and getting industries to take responsibility for their own development. \u00b7  The Action Agenda approach helped to ensure that the Government had a good  understanding  of  industry  needs  \u2013  and  that  these  views  were  more cohesive  than  in  the  past.  This  helped  them  to  develop  effective  policy responses  that  address  industry-wide  needs  rather  than  those  of  particular sectors or sub-sectors. \u00b7  Because the emphasis was on identifying the actions that the industry itself could take to develop, the Action Agenda approach encouraged industry to develop  solutions  to  its  problems  that  were  not  reliant  on  Government funding. Weaknesses \u00b7  Whilst the Action Agenda approach appears to have been successful for the tourism sector, it has not been universally successful in all sectors. Critical Success Factors -  Delivery Issues \u00b7  Success has been dependent on having the appropriate individuals from the industry in the industry leaders and implementation groups.   50 \u00b7  In order to be successful it was necessary for industry to take ownership of the process, and to make a commitment. There was also a need for strong leadership by industry champions and support from ministerial champions. Key Lessons for Scotland \u00b7  Action Agendas appear to have been successful in getting industry involved even though there is no commitment from government to provide funding for, or assistance to, implement to solutions identified. \u00b7  Key to this is the fact that the Action Agenda gives credibility and recognition to  industries  that  might  otherwise  not  be  high  profile,  the  access  to government departments that the approach provides and the opportunity to bring  together  industry  association,  individual  companies  and  research institutions to work together. GO2 (BRITISH COLUMBIA) The Intervention Aims and Objectives Go2\u2019s mission is to anticipate and respond to current and emerging human resource challenges and opportunities and deliver practical recruitment, retention and training resources that drive results. Rationale\/Market Failure The  rationale  for  the  creation  of  go2  was  the  result  of  an  18-month  study  that recommended the tourism industry improve its recruitment initiatives and its retention of workers, as well as its training and professional development of those currently in, and those interested in joining, the tourism workforce. This study and ensuing strategy was done as part of a four-pillar industry growth strategy to double tourism revenues over a ten year period.   The most effective way to ensure this \u2013 and to ensure a thriving  tourism  industry  in  British  Columbia  \u2013  was  to  create  a  new  HRD  coordinating organisation to implement a multi-year industry HR strategy focusing on the areas of recruitment, retention, training and research. Columbia \u2013 is through collaborative action. Beneficiary Group(s) The British Columbia tourism industry in general. What Does the Intervention Involve? Go2  is  an  independent,  non-profit  industry  association.  go2\u2019s  role  focuses  on  the following: \u00b7  Coordinating  the  industry\u2019s  HRD  strategy  \u2013  implementing  recruitment, retention and training initiatives \u00b7  Compiling  labour  market  intelligence  and  conducting  further  research  into employers\u2019 HR needs \u00b7  Conducting ongoing planning to ensure effective adaptation of HR strategy \u00b7  Developing  competency  standards  for  tourism  occupations  (in  partnership with  the  Canadian  Tourism  Human  Resource  Council  and  the  provincial Industry Training Authority) \u00b7  Incorporating marketing activities into the core funding model: -  Educating and influencing employers regarding HR practices -  Liaising with education and training providers -  Liaising with government on training priorities -  Marketing career and employment opportunities to the general public   52 -  Acting  as  an  information  and  referral  service  with  online  links  to  HR resources for both employers and employees \u00b7  Identifying support services that will operate on a cost-recovery or profitable basis and include: -  Sales\/distribution  of  HRD  resources  (e.g.,  training  workbooks, performance standards) -  Occupational certification involving competency assessments by industry evaluators -  Industry training programs in selected areas such as Serving It Right and FoodSafe. \u00b7  Establishing a board of industry leaders, with nominations solicited from all sectors and regions of the province. Who Is Involved? Go2\u2019s members are industry-related associations and organisations representing all sectors  of  the  tourism  industry,  educational  partners  and  tourism  marketing  and promotion organisations. Who Leads? Go2 is an independent organisation that leads in addressing labour market issues in the tourism industry. How Is the Intervention Delivered? Go2 delivers a range of interventions to address labour market issues in the tourism industry. Major initiatives include the Move On Up campaign, which is intended to be a multiyear programme reaching out to youth, their influencers, and under-represented labour groups  such  as  older  workers,  aboriginal  people,  new  immigrants,  potential immigrants, people with disabilities and youth at risk. Tactics include advertising, public relations, high school and other career awareness presentations, career fairs, partnerships with industry to promote careers in specific sectors, and the moveonup.ca website and e-newsletter, and new media strategies including FaceBook.","cites":null},{"id":704914,"title":"Employment and Skills for the 2012 Games: Research and Evidence, LSC and LDA.","authors":[],"date":"2006","doi":null,"raw":"Experian  (2006).
