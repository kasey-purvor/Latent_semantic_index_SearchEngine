Daniels and Joseph W. Hogan, Chapman and Hall\/CRC,\n2008, pp. xx + 303. Scope: research monograph. Level: professional statisticians and\nPhD students.\nLongitudinal studies are almost always plagued by missing data. Examples include re-\nsearch data in public health, medicine, life and social sciences, as well as in environmental\nand geophysical studies of ice ages and the past climate. In the case of data involving\npeople over a period of time there are usually some drop-outs due to e.g. moving away,\nor death, or simply disinclination to continue. Similarly, some physical measurements in\na historic time series may be corrupted or missing. In such cases it may be impossible\nto repeat the measurements, or the survey, so that the best that can be done is to find a\nway of accommodating the lacun\u00e6 such that they do minimal damage to the reliability\nof any conclusions.\nThe problem with missing data is that they may, or may not, be typical. They can\nbe missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). Thus assumptions\nare needed about the distribution of the missing responses, and these assumptions will\nbe subjective because they cannot be tested against data. The authors view is that\n\u201c...analysis of incomplete data cries out for the Bayesian approach\u201d, because the subjective\ncomponent of the inference can then be formalized. The idea is to exploit the theorem\nintroduced by 18th century mathematician and Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes. It\nrelates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events and is ideally\nsuited to utilization by statisticians. The authors point out that, although the idea has\nbeen around for over 30 years, it is surprisingly underutilized. Their book is evidently\nintended to correct this deficiency.\nThere are ten chapters, taking the reader through motivating statistical examples,\nregression models, the fundamentals of Bayesian inference, worked examples for cases\nwith complete data, and then five chapters on how to treat problems with missing data.\nThe numerous case studies are described succinctly albeit in considerable detail. The style\nis tight and economical, with no wasted words, and the intended readersip seems to be\nmainly mathematicians and statisticians. The book may also be of interest to physicists\nand other scientists, given the widespread and increasing use of Bayesian methods in e.g.\nhigh energy physics, field theory, computing, network analysis and ecology.\nPeter V.
