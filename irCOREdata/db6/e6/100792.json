For example, the favorable\natmospheric transmission characteristics at these wave-\nlengths, including low atmospheric scattering and\nabsorption1 relative to shorter wavelengths, would make\nthem attractive for secure free-space communications in a\nrange of security and military applications, in particular, for\ncommunication via low orbit satellites or unmanned aerial\nvehicles. However, for most of the important 3\u20134 \u0001m spec-\ntral band, there are currently no practical high-temperature\nsemiconductor lasers. Although much progress has been\nmade in the development of \u201cshort wavelength\u201d quantum\ncascade lasers \u0001QCLs\u0002, with room temperature pulsed laser\nemission at a wavelength of 4.1 \u0001m in InGaAs\/AlAsSb\/ InP\nstrain compensated devices,2 240 K pulsed laser emission at\n\u0002\u00033.2 \u0001m from InAs\/AlSb devices,3 and low temperature\npulsed laser operation at \u0002\u00033.1 \u0001m for both InP based\nstrain compensated InGaAs\/ InAlAs\/AlAs \u0001Ref. 4\u0002 and lat-\ntice matched InGaAs\/AlAsSb,5 only one QCL operating\ncontinuous wave \u0001cw\u0002 at room temperature and at wave-\nlengths below 4.0 \u0001m has been reported.6 The longest wave-\nlength for room temperature cw operation for a type I inter-\nband diode is \u00033.1 \u0001m,7 whereas maximum cw operating\ntemperatures of 264,8 257,9 and finally 269 K,10 at emission\nwavelengths of 3.3, 3.7, and 4.05 \u0001m, respectively, have\nbeen achieved recently by interband cascade lasers \u0001ICLs\u0002,\nwhich have also achieved cw power outputs above 1 W at\n78 K.11\nThe aluminum-indium-gallium-antimonide\n\u0001AlxGayIn1\u2212x\u2212ySb\u0002 material system offers great promise for\nefficient diode laser operation across the 3\u20135 \u0001m wave-\nlength range. It offers an excellent compromise between the\nrequirements for good electronic and optical confinement\nand those for low series resistance, and the use of an active\nregion comprising compressively strained type I quantum\nwells is predicted to lead to increased gain, which leads to\nlower threshold current densities and hence reduced nonra-\ndiative Auger recombination.12,13 Although there has been a\nprevious report of optically pumped GaInSb\/AlGaInSb mul-\ntiple quantum well lasers grown onto GaSb substrates,14 in\nthis paper, we report the growth of GaInSb\/AlGaInSb quan-\ntum well \u0001QW\u0002 diode lasers onto GaAs substrates. Growth\nonto these substrates not only offers potential benefits in\nterms of cost and availability but also opens the possibility of\nthe integration of midinfrared diode lasers with GaAs based\noptoelectronic components, such as electro-optic modulators,\nfor beam steering and beam shaping. In the future, similar\ngrowth techniques may enable the growth of these layers\nonto Si substrates \u0001which have the additional advantage of\nrelatively high thermal conductivity\u0002 as, for example, in the\nrecent demonstration of superluminescent emission at room\ntemperature GaSb quantum-well-based light emitting\ndiodes.15\nGaInSb\/AlGaInSb diode lasers were grown by molecu-\nlar beam epitaxy at QinetiQ Malvern onto on-axis semi-\ninsulating \u0001001\u0002 GaAs substrates. The structure of the diodes\nand associated energy band diagram under zero bias are\nshown schematically in Fig. 1. The structure consists of a\nhigh Al content AlzIn1\u2212zSb interfacial layer grown directly\nonto the GaAs, Al0.25In0.75Sb cladding regions,\nAl0.12Ga0.12In0.76Sb barriers, and two Ga0.16In0.84Sb QW ac-\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

The AlzIn1\u2212zSb layer and bottom Al0.25In0.75Sb\ncladding region together accommodate the lattice mismatch\nbetween the GaAs substrate and the GaInSb quantum wells.\nAlthough no measurements of dislocation densities were\nmade on the wafers described here, from atomic force mi-\ncroscopy measurements on similar structures it is expected\nthat the dislocation density will be \u0003108 cm\u22122. Further work\nis underway to investigate both the mechanisms of disloca-\ntion propagation and the effect of the dislocations on the\nlaser properties. Beryllium was used to dope the top cladding\nlayers p type \u0001to nominal levels of 3\u00041018 and\n2\u00041017 cm\u22123, as shown in Fig. 1\u0002, whereas tellurium was\nused to dope the bottom n type to a nominal level of\n2\u00041018 cm\u22123. The composition of the cladding, barrier, and\nquantum well layers was determined by x-ray diffraction\n\u0001XRD\u0002 measurements on both the full laser structure and also\non two calibration layers. The first calibration layer consisted\nof the bottom buffer \u0001AlInSb\u0002 and barrier \u0001AlGaInSb\u0002 layers\nonly \u0001i.e., growth up to the bottom of the first QW\u0002. XRD\nmeasurement of the layer lattice parameters showed the bar-\nrier to be well matched to the buffer with the strain in the\nbarrier less than 0.2% \u0001the majority of this strain is due to\nresidual strain in the buffer layer\u0002. The second calibration\nlayer consisted of the bottom buffer and barrier layers plus\n15 periods of the GaInSb QW and AlGaInSb barriers \u0001no top\nbarrier was present in this layer\u0002. XRD analysis showed the\ncompressive strain in the QWs to be approximately 0.6%.\nFurther details of the measurements undertaken on the cali-\nbration layers are given in Ref. 16.\nRidges with sloping sidewalls and a width of \u000331 \u0001m at\nthe active region were defined using contact photolithogra-\nphy and wet chemical etching. Approximately 700 nm of\nSiOX was then deposited by plasma enhanced chemical va-\npor deposition and a window opened by contact lithography\nand dry etching. Sputtered Ti\/Au metallic contacts were then\ndeposited, one on top of the ridge to provide a p-type contact\nand one on top of the etched region adjacent to the ridge to\nprovide a n-type contact. Electroplating was used to increase\nthe total metal thickness to \u00035 \u0001m to aid heat dissipation.\nThe devices were cleaved to cavity lengths of 2 mm and\nmounted substrate side down onto uncoated copper blocks\nusing a nonmetallic epoxy glue \u0001note that this glue provides\na relatively poor thermal path relative to, for example, in-\ndium soldering\u0002. The facets were neither polished nor coated.\nEmission spectra were acquired using a Bentham M300\ngrating spectrometer, together with a cooled InSb detector,\nwith a resolution of \u00030.1 nm, with the device mounted on\nthe cold finger of a continuous flow liquid helium cryostat.\nThe device was driven with a 50 kHz square wave with a 5%\nduty cycle \u0001pulse length \u00031 \u0001s\u0002 and with a peak current of\n400 mA \u0001equivalent to a current density of \u0003680 A\/cm2\u0002. At\ntemperatures up to 95 K, multimode lasing was observed, as\nshown in Fig. 2, whereas electroluminescence was observed\nfrom 95 K up to room temperature. Figure 2 shows the mea-\nsured emission spectra taken at 7, 55, and 95 K together with\nthe predicted spontaneous emission wavelengths \u0001e1-hh1\u0002,\nplotted as a function of temperature, calculated using\n8\u00048 k\u00b7p theory with strain taken into account.12\nFigure 3 shows a typical plot of the laser emission L\nversus current density J as a function of temperature \u0001note\nthat although characteristics were taken at 5 K intervals,\nsome plots have been omitted to aid clarity\u0002. In this case, the\ndevice was mounted on the cold finger of a closed cycle\ncryostat and was driven with a 10 kHz square wave with a\n1% duty cycle \u0001pulse length \u00031 \u0001s\u0002. Threshold current den-\nsities were extracted from the data shown in Fig. 3 by a\nlinear fit to the points above threshold and are shown on a\nlogarithmic scale as a function of temperature in Fig. 4. At\n75 K, the threshold current density is 78 A\/cm2, which is\ncomparable to the value of 40 A\/cm2 we have obtained pre-\nFIG. 1.

Although this is larger than the value of 660 A\/cm2\nobtained recently from an ICL at 269 K,10 and emitting at\n4.05 \u0001m, Andreev et al.12 predicted that the threshold cur-\nrent density will fall by a factor of \u000310 at room temperature\nas the strain in the QW active region of the\nGaInSb\/AlGaInSb lasers is increased to approximately\n1.5%. Further experiments are therefore underway examin-\ning the effect of strain on the laser performance.\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the characteristics of\nGaInSb\/AlGaInSb type I quantum well diode lasers grown\nonto GaAs. Multimode lasing was observed up to a tempera-\nture of 95 K, with electroluminescence observed up to room\ntemperature. Further improvements to the diode mounting,\nfacet polishing, and coating, coupled with the realization of\nquantum wells with higher strain, offer the prospect of rela-\ntively low current operation at room temperature.\nThis work was supported by the UK DTI Technology\nProgramme.
