In this paper we use \nregression analysis to examine the relationship of growing season mean chlorophyll a \nconcentration with total phosphorus and total nitrogen using summary data from over 1000 \nEuropean lakes.  For analysis, lakes were grouped into types with three categories of mean \ndepth, alkalinity and humic content.  The lakes were also divided into broad geographic \nregions covering Atlantic, Northern, Central\/Baltic and for some types the Mediterranean \nareas of Europe.  Chlorophyll a was found to be significantly related to both total phosphorus \nand total nitrogen, although total phosphorus was almost always found to be the best predictor \nof chlorophyll.  Different nutrient chlorophyll relationships were found for lakes according to \nmean depth and alkalinity, although no significant effect of geographic region or humic \ncontent was found for the majority of lake types.  We identified three groups of lakes with \nsignificantly different responses.  Deep lakes had the lowest yield of chlorophyll per unit of \nnutrient, low and moderate alkalinity shallow lakes the highest and high alkalinity lakes were \nintermediate.  We recommend that the regression models provided for these three lake groups \nshould be used for lake management in Europe and discuss the limitations of such models. \n 2\nREBECCA MS no.03 \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe introduction of the Water Framework Directive (2000\/60\/EC) in Europe has focused the \nattention of many lake managers and scientists on relationships between ecological status and \nanthropogenic pressures.  For lakes, nutrients remain one of the key pressures influencing \nEuropean lakes and one of the most obvious and well known effects that need to be quantified \nis the impact that elevated nutrients have on phytoplankton biomass. \n \nChlorophyll a concentration is a widely used measure of phytoplankton biomass and since the \nfounding papers of Sakamoto (1966) and Dillon & Rigler (1974) there have been many \nstudies showing strong empirical links between chlorophyll and nutrients, particularly \nphosphorus (cf. Prairie et al., 1989).  The most widely known relationships are those from the \nOECD study (Vollenweider & Kerekes, 1980) and these are often used to underpin decisions \nabout lake management (Ryding & Rast, 1989).  Reynolds (1980) has highlighted the \nlimitations of such models for individual lake predictions, but their value to lake managers, \nwho need to make decisions with limited data, is undeniable. \n \nOne problem with the published relationships is the substantial variability of the parameters \ngenerated from different regression analyses.  These differences are due to the many \ninfluences on the nutrient chlorophyll relationship.  Regressions drawn from specific lake \ndistricts are particularly appropriate for making predictions about lakes within those districts, \nbut they may be of less use for lakes in other areas.  Conversely, large data sets will be \ninfluenced by many and various factors, all of which will appear as increased variation.  In \nthis paper we present the results of the analysis of a large data set drawn from a wide variety \n 3\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nof national European data archives.  In particular we explore the variation of nutrient \nchlorophyll relationships in different lake types with a view to providing a set of regression \nequations that can be used to underpin lake nutrient management decisions for European \nlakes. \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nData for this study were gathered from national data archives from individual European \ncountries, as a basis for studying relationships between biological and chemical elements in \nEuropean lakes as part of the EU project REBECCA (Moe et al., this issue ).  As part of the \nWFD Common Implementation Strategy (Van de Bund et al., 2004) lakes have been divided \ninto 6 geographic regions. Individual sample data were available from 16 countries, spanning \na period from 1988 to 2004.  Five of the six regions were represented, although relatively few \ndata were available from the Mediterranean region, and the data set was dominated by data \nfrom countries in northern, and to a lesser extent central Europe.  \n \nChlorophyll a (Chl), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) data were summarised for \neach lake as a single mean value for a common \u201cgrowing season\u201d of April \u2013 September. In a \nlarge data set drawn from many different sources, different sampling frequencies could \ninfluence summary statistics.  To minimise noise, only lakes with more than three sampling \noccasions during this growing season were selected, and data were summarised by site year \nand month and the above three determinands matched prior to calculation of a single mean for \neach lake.  This ensured that only matched summary data for Chl, TP and TN contributed to \nthe final mean value.  Data for all available years and sites within a lake contributed to a final \n 4\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nsingle lake average value for each of Chl, TP and TN, thereby obtaining only one single value \nper lake for each parameter in the regression analyses. \n \nThis resulted in a data set of 1138 lakes, substantially larger than any other reported in the \nliterature that we are aware of (cited in table 2).  As pointed out by Praire et al. (1989) this \nbrings with it additional uncertainties, caused by different geographical regions, climate and \nsampling strategies.  We will examine the effect of region and lake types, and thus assigned \neach lake into one of 9 core types based on alkalinity and mean depth and 3 sub-types based \non colour (Table 1).  Data for alkalinity, depth and colour were taken from national data \narchives, collated by Moe et al. (2008, this issue). These types were identified by a range of \nEuropean experts during the WFD intercalibration process and represent the best available \nagreed typology that is likely to minimise natural biological variation in European lakes. \n \nChlorophyll nutrient relationships , denoted as Chl = f(TP), Chl = f(TN) and Chl = f(TP,TN), \nwere derived using linear least squares regression.  Prior to analysis all data were \nlogarithmically transformed (base 10) to ensure their homogeneity of variance, as is common \npractice for data of this type.  We investigated the effects of categorical variables lake type, \ngeographic region and humic content on these relationships using univariate General Linear \nModelling (GLM).  The model was run with Chl as dependent variable, TP as covariate and \neach of the above categorical variables as fixed factors.  Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was \nused to test the significance of the factor on the slope, intercept and their interactions.  Type \nIII sums of squares were used to test significance, which had the advantage that they are not \ndependent on the frequency of observations in each group (Field, 2005).   \n \n 5\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nHaving identified which type factors significantly influenced the regression, we compared the \nresulting regression equations to identify which types had similar regression coefficients.  \nLake types with similar coefficients were then re-grouped and the general linear model \n(GLM) repeated to check that the type factor was no longer significantly influencing the \nregression relationship.  Thus, we were able to identify the key factors influencing the nutrient \nChl relationship and identify appropriate groups of lake types.   \n \nPrior to analysis, we investigated the general shape of the relationships between variables \nusing LOWESS techniques (Cleveland, 1979).  This enabled us to restrict regression to a \nrange of nutrient concentrations where the data were linearly related.  For Chl = f(TP) we \ntherefore restricted regression to data where TP < 100 \u03bcg l-1 and for Chl = f(TN) where TN < \n1700 \u03bcg l-1.  For Chl = f(TP,TN) no restrictions were made as our purpose was to identify if \nthe use of both nutrients provided an effective model for the whole data range.  We tested the \nsignificance of including a second predictor variable using ANOVA. As TP and TN might be \ncorrelated, we tested for the variance inflation factor (VIF), which is a good indicator of \nwhether one predictor has a strong linear relationship with other predictors.  Where the VIF \nwas <10 we concluded that predictor variables were not strongly related (Myers 1990).   \n \nWe investigated the relative power of TP and TN in predicting Chl for different lake types \nusing stepwise multiple regression, comparing regression coefficients as values standardised \nby standard deviation units (\u03b2 coefficients) to make them independent of scale.  Prior to \nanalysis, the data were screened by removing samples with reported values of Chl or TP of \n<1.0 \u00b5g l-1 as we considered these were likely to be errors in the source data.  We also \nexcluded results where the Chl: TP ratio was >1.0, which was the 99th percentile of the whole \ndata set.  \n 6\nREBECCA MS no.03 \n \nTo explore the effect of TN:TP ratios, proposed by several studies as important factors \ninfluencing the relationship between nutrients and chlorophyll (N\u0171rnberg & Shaw, 1999), we \ngrouped data into 5 TN:TP categories (\u226410, >10\u226417, >17\u226425, >25\u226450, >50).  We chose the \nfirst two categories as they are widely reported values at which nitrogen limitation of \nphytoplankton  biomass may occur (Forsberg & Ryding 1980); the others are convenient \ncategorical divisions.  Analysis was carried out using SPSS v14.  \n \n \nResults \n \nAfter data screening > 1000 typed pairs of data were available for analysis (1129 TP vs. Chl; \n1138 TN vs. Chl and 1077 TN & TP vs. Chl).  Chlorophyll, phosphorus and nitrogen \nconcentrations ranged over 2 orders of magnitude, increasing markedly as lakes get shallower \nand to a lesser extent as alkalinity increases (Fig 1a-c).  In low and moderate alkalinity lakes \nthere was also a marked effect of humic content with the highest concentrations of all of these \nparameters in polyhumic lakes and the lowest in clear water lakes. In high alkalinity lakes, \nhowever, the effect of humic content was either non-existent or even reversed in high \nalkalinity very shallow lakes. The ratio of TN:TP ranged from <2 to >100, with different \nranges characteristic of each lake type (Fig 1d).  TN:TP was highest in low and moderate \nalkalinity, deep lakes and became progressively lower as depth decreased and alkalinity \nincreased. Polyhumic and humic lakes nearly always had lower TN:TP ratios than clear water \nlakes, and a substantial proportion of lakes in the coloured, very shallow lake categories had \nvalues below 17 and a minority of lakes below 10.  The effect of colour on the TN:TP ratio \nwas confirmed by 2 way ANOVA, which showed significant effects of both lake type (F = \n 7\nREBECCA MS no.03 \n12.1 p <0.001) and humic type (F=9.7 p<0.001) with post hoc Bonferroni tests showing \nsignificant differences in mean N:P ratios for all comparisons of humic categories.  \n \nRegression relationships \nScatter plots for the relationships Chl = f(TP) and Chl = f(TN) are shown in figure 2.  The \nLOESS fitted line shows non-linearity in both relationships.  There is slight indication of a \nsigmoidal response, but the most marked non-linearity is the reduction in slope at high \nnutrient levels.  This is most marked for TN, but also occurs for TP.  The upper point of \ninflection for Chl = f(TP) occurs at ca. TP = 100 \u03bcg l-1 and for Chl = f(TN) at TN =1700 \u03bcg l-\n1. Asymptotic behaviour of Chl=f(TP) is widely reported, occurring typically at around this \nTP concentration (Prarie et al., 1989; Canfield, 1983), although in our case the LOESS fits do \nnot give as clear an indication of a plateau in chlorophyll as do those of others.  However, \nbecause of this we restricted the range of TP and TN concentrations in our least square \nregressions to concentrations of <100 \u03bcg l-1 (TP) and <1700 \u03bcg l-1 (TN) (Fig 3).  \n \nThe regressions of all lakes taken together regardless of type were the following:   \n \n1. Log10 Chl = -0.455(\u00b10.020)+1.026(\u00b10.016) Log10TP R2 = 0.78 (TP <100 \u03bcg  l-1) \n2. Log10 Chl = -2.828(\u00b10.093)+1.355(\u00b10.035) Log10TN R2 = 0.58 (TN <1700 \u03bcg l-1) \n3. Log10 Chl = -1.028(\u00b10.083) + 0.792(\u00b10.027) Log10TP + 0.324(\u00b10.039) Log10TN  \nR2 = 0.77 \n \nAll regressions were significant (p<0.001) and the coefficients of determination (R2) were \nsimilar to those reported in other published studies (Table 2).  Scatter plots with the \nregressions are shown in Fig 4.  Within the linear range of these functions, TP was a better \n 8\nREBECCA MS no.03 \npredictor than TN, although over the full data range the combined Chl \u2013 f(TN,TP) model gave \nalmost as good a prediction.   \n \nWe also tested the use of a Chl = f(TN,TP) model restricted to the linear portion of both the \nTP and TN relationships.   \n \n4. Log10 Chl = -1.135(\u00b1(0.026) + 0.896(\u00b10.026) Log10 TP + 0.322(\u00b10.039) Log10 TN  \nR2 = 0.80 (TP <100 \u03bcg l-1, TN < 1700 \u03bcg l-1) \n \nIn both models collinearity was found to be low (VIF 2.6 model 3 and 2.5 model 4). For both \nmodels 3 & 4 the addition of TN provided a small, but significant (F = 68.2 p<0.001 model 3 \nand 67.4 p<0.001 model 4) increase in predictive power.  The standardised \u03b2 regression \ncoefficients for TP were however much higher than those for TN (\u03b2TP = 0.71 \u03b2TN = 0.20 \nmodel 3; \u03b2TP = 0.75 \u03b2TN = 0.18 model 4) indicating that TP was the more influential \nvariable. \n \nThere is a significant degree of scatter in these data and we now explore whether dividing \nlakes into types can account for this variation and thus provide more useful regression \nmodels.  The general linear model (GLM) demonstrated that while geographic region did not \ninfluence the regressions, lake type was a significant factor in the regression models, so we \nrepeated the regression analysis on lakes split by type (Table 3).  Few of the resulting R2 were \nhigher than those obtained for the whole data set, but significantly different regression \nparameters were found.  We give particular attention to the differences in slope (Fig 4).  For a \nlog-log relationship this characterises the relative rate of increase of two variables and thus \nthe highest slopes indicate lake types where there is the greatest positive response to TP or \n 9\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nTN.  Our all lake relationships had slopes for TP close to 1, slightly higher for TN, but in \nseveral cases the type-specific slopes were significantly different.  Differences were greatest \nfor Chl = f(TN), but for both Chl = f(TP) and Chl = f(TN), deep lakes had significantly lower \nslopes.  In general the chlorophyll response to nutrients increases significantly as depth \ndecreases and for shallow and very shallow lakes it decreases with alkalinity.   These results \nsuggest that predictions made without reference to type may significantly over or under \nestimate chlorophyll concentrations.  Type specific relationships seem to offer the best \napproach for TN, but for TP we have divided lakes into 3 groups: 1) deep lakes, 2) moderate \nand low alkalinity shallow and very shallow lakes, and 3) high alkalinity shallow and very \nshallow lakes.  Within these groups the GLM confirmed that lake type did not significantly \ninfluence the regression and the following equations (all significant p<0.001) represent what \nwe consider are appropriate models for these lake groups. \n \n5. Low and moderate alkalinity (<1mekv l-1), shallow (3-15 m mean depth ) and very \nshallow (< 3m mean depth) lakes: \nLog10 Chl = -0.528(\u00b10.03) + 1.108(\u00b10.02) Log10 TP  R2 = 0.81 \n6. High alkalinity (>1 mekv l-1), shallow (3-15 m mean depth ) and very shallow (< 3m mean \ndepth) lakes: Log10 Chl = -0.306(\u00b10.10) + 0.868(\u00b10.07) Log10 TP  R2 = 0.52 \n7. All deep lakes (>15 m mean depth):  \nLog10 Chl = -0.286(\u00b10.04) +0.776(\u00b10.041) Log10 TP  R2 = 0.65 \n \nColour from humic compounds is another factor which has been reported to influence the \nChlorophyll nutrient relationship (Havens and N\u0171rnberg, 2004).  In our data we found that  \nTP, TN and Chl were higher in humic lakes, but GLM showed no significant effect of colour \non Chl = f(TN) in any lake types. For Chl = f(TP) only one lake type (low alkalinity deep \n 10\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nlakes) showed a humic type effect with a significantly higher slope and intercept in the humic \nlakes than in the clear water lakes (Fig 5). The regression equations were both significant \n(p<0.001) and are given below: \n \n8. LAD Humic:   Log10 Chl = -0.733(\u00b10.14) + 1.261(\u00b10.15) Log10 TP  R2 = 0.75 \n9. LAD Clear:  Log10 Chl = -0.208(\u00b10.05) + 0.639(\u00b10.07) Log10 TP  R2 = 0.42 \n \n \nEffect of TN:TP ratio on regression \nLakes were also grouped in categories based on TN:TP ratio to investigate the effects of this \non the regression relationships.  This ratio should indicate the potential for nitrogen or \nphosphorus limitation, at least at the seasonal scale, and we thus might expect that where \nTN:TP is low, nitrogen may limit algal growth and thus TN would provide a better prediction \nof chlorophyll.  Conversely when TN:TP is high, phosphorus is more likely to limit growth \nand TP would be the better predictor.  To an extent we found these predictions were true.  \nWhere TN:TP is <10, TN provided a better prediction of Chl with a higher R2 and regression \nslope (Fig 6). As TN:TP increased this difference is rapidly reduced, with similar R2 and \nregressions slopes for either TN or TP. The highest category (TN:TP >50) Chl = f(TP) \nprovides a better fit and has a higher slope than Chl = f(TN), indicating the clear dominance \nof phosphorus limitation.  \n \nFinally, using stepwise multiple regression, we investigate the relative predictive power of TP \nand TN if lakes were split into alkalinity, depth and humic categories.  Table 4 shows the \nresulting values for R2 together with the standardised \u03b2 regression coefficients (in standard \ndeviation units), which can be used to compare the relative importance of each predictor \n 11\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nvariable independent of scale.  Stepwise regression selected Chl = f(TP) for the majority of \nlake types, but for those lake types with the lowest TN:TP ratios (humic HAVS and \npolyhumic MAVS) Chl = f(TN) was the preferred model.  In 7 of the 19 types, Chl = \nf(TP,TN) was selected and for three of these (polyhumic LAS, polyhumic LAVS & humic \nLAVS) the \u03b2 coefficients were very similar indicating that both TP and TN had equal \npredictive power.  All of these lake types had relatively low TN:TP ratios where it might be \nexpected that nitrogen limitation would occur.  The remaining types either had TP as the \nsingle predictor variable, or if both TP and TN were selected, the \u03b2 coefficients suggested that \nTN played a minor role in the model. \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nThere is a relatively wide range of parameter values available in the literature relating to \nregression models which can be used to estimate chlorophyll a concentration from phosphorus \n(Table 2).  Several studies (Prairie et al., 1989; White, 1983) report values that generally \npredict lower chlorophyll values than those we found when we grouped all lakes together. \nThese include the widely used equations from the OECD study (cited in Vollenweider & \nKerekes, 1980).  Other studies (Dillon & Rigler, 1974; Jones & Bachmann, 1976) report \nmodels yielding higher predictions of chlorophyll and these matched our all lake results more \nclosely.  Both of these studies reported  slopes significantly > 1, which on a log log plot \nproduces an increasing yield of chlorophyll as TP increases, in contrast our all lakes model \nhad a slope close to 1, showing that the relationship was close to linear.  There are less \nreported models for total nitrogen, but those of N\u00fcrnberg (1996) and Prairie et al. (1989) are \n 12\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nvery similar to our all lakes combined model.  However, our type-specific nutrient models \nproduced values that correspond to the full range of those reported.   \n \nFor Chl=f(TP) our deep lakes model predicted the lowest chlorophyll concentrations, that are \nonly slightly higher than those from the OECD equations.  Our high-alkalinity lake model \npredicted higher values while the models for the other lake types, (low and moderate \nalkalinity shallow and very shallow lakes),  predict chlorophyll values that are similar to the \nhighest reported values.  For Chl = f(TN) our deep-lake equations provide lower predicticted \nvalues than those in the literature, while the low and moderate alkalinity very shallow lakes \nare significantly  higher.  These discrepancies highlight some of the issues of log log \nregression relationships: they hide within them a relatively wide range of values.  Reynolds \n(1980) identified this when he pointed out that regression models can only describe the \ngeneral behaviour of lake populations, and that in reality any particular lake will have a \nchlorophyll yield that is influenced by a number of factors other than nutrients.  None the less, \nthese models are in many cases the only method for lake managers to determine the \nrelationship between a nutrients, a factor they can potentially control, and algal biomass.  \nWhat is important, is that managers should use an equation that is derived using data from a \nlake type that matches as closely as possible the lake they are concerned with. \n \nOur data show that lake depth is a key factor, with deep lakes generally less responsive to \nnutrient enrichment.  Stauffer (1991) pointed out the importance of self-shading and suggests \nthis is responsible for the levelling of Chl at the highest TP concentrations.  We might expect \nthis in deep lakes if they are light limited with a euphotic depth less than the mixing depth, \nhowever as we do not have data on these parameters we were unable to explore these \nrelationships further.  Shallow lakes, in particular very shallow lakes, are less likely to be light \n 13\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nlimited, particularly when chlorophyll values are low, as we found for low and moderate \nalkalinity lakes, and it is not surprising that in these lakes chlorophyll yield per unit of \nnutrient was generally higher.   \n \nWe found the weakest relationships for Chl = f(TP) in high alkalinity shallow lakes.  \nH\u00e5kanson et al. (2005) also reported that the predictive power of Chl TP models increased \nmarkedly if hardwater lakes were omitted from their model and concluded that this was linked \nto bio-availability of particulate phosphorus.  Calcium may have a role to play in precipitating \nphosphorus, making it less bioavailable.  High alkalinity lakes also generally have the highest \nlevels of phosphorus which will have two effects that could influence the relationships:  \nFirstly, chlorophyll will also be high, and even in shallow lakes could result in light \ninhibition, particularly for mixed or weakly stratified lakes.  Secondly, at high TP the TN:TP \nratio can be very low leading to nitrogen, rather than phosphorus limitation and thus a poor \nChl=f(TP) relationship.  Prairie et al. (1989) concluded that variability in published \nrelationships between Chl and nutrients can be accounted for by TN:TP ratios.  We found \nsimilar results, but only for lakes where TN:TP was <10.  In these lakes, contrary to the \nfindings of Prairie, we found that TN provided a better predictor of Chl than TP.  A TN:TP \nratio <10 is generally interpreted as evidence of nitrogen limitation (Downing & McCauley, \n1992, Smith 1982) so this observation is not surprising and may account for at least some of \nthe scatter in the Chl=f(TP) relationship in high alkalinity lakes.   \n \nFor very shallow lakes, interactions with macrophytes are also likely to be important (Phillips, \n2003), and in lakes dominated by macrophytes, top-down control mediated through \nzooplankton grazing is also likely to play a key role in reducing chlorophyll concentrations \nbelow that predicted by their nutrient status (Scheffer, 1990 ).  We do not have sufficient \n 14\nREBECCA MS no.03 \ninformation in our database to identify lakes likely to be influenced by top-down controls, but \ngrazing by zooplankton is likely to introduce additional variability into the nutrient \nchlorophyll relationship and could be particularly strong in high alkalinity lakes where TP is \nwithin the range where top-down effects are strongest (Jeppesen et al 2000).  It is thus not \nsurprising that we find the greatest variability in Chl=f(TP) and we suggest that a combination \nof top-down influences, light inhibition and nitrogen limitation all contribute to limiting Chl \nin high alkalinity lakes. \n \nHumic substances have also been shown to influence the nutrient chlorophyll relationships in \nlakes.  Edmundson & Carlson (1998) and Havens (2003) both reported lower yields of \nchlorophyll concentration per unit of TP.  This may result from lower availability of light, due \nto increased water colour (Havens, 2003) or to lower bioavailability of phosphorus (Jones \n1998)  In our study we found that low and moderate alkalinity humic lakes had higher Chl \nconcentrations. This was accompanied by higher TN and TP concentrations, but we could \nfind no evidence of a reduced yield of chlorophyll. N\u00fcrnberg & Shaw (1999) also reported \nelevated nutrients in humic lakes, but in this case a small but significant positive effect on the \nChl=f(TP) relationship.  We only found this for low alkalinity deep humic lakes, despite the \nfact that TN:TP ratios in humic low and moderate alkalinity lakes is lower than those in clear \nwaters.  Havens & N\u00fcrnberg (2004) pointed out the interactions between humic substances \nand mixing regime, demonstrating that the Chl concentration in mixed humic lakes is \nmarginally reduced.  They propose that in stratified lakes phytoplankton is able to adjust to \nreduced light availability by migration, resulting in elevated Chl level in surface layers. We \ncan only speculate as to the explanation of the positive effect on the Chl = f(TP) relationship \nwe found in deep low alkalinity humic lakes, as we have insufficient information to identify \nstratified and mixed lakes.  However, it is reasonable to assume that this lake type is very \n 15\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nlikely to be stratified, and the higher yield we observed may be a result of vertical migration \nof phytoplankton, an effect not seen in shallow mixed lakes. Also light-adaptation in humic \nlakes yielding higher Chla:biomass ratios may contribute to explaining why deep low-\nalkalinity humic lakes have steeper Chla=f(TP) slope than the comparable clearwater lakes. \n \nWe found a clearer effect of TN:TP ratios on Chl = f(TP), particularly when combined with \nhumic content.  TN:TP was low in humic lakes and a substantial proportion of the very \nshallow humic lakes had values low enough to suggest TN rather than TP limitation.  This is \nin contrast to N\u00fcrnberg & Shaw (1999), who found no evidence of changes to TN:TP ratios in \nhumic lakes.  In our data set stepwise multiple regression demonstrated that TN rather than \nTP provided the best predictor of Chl in humic high alkalinity and polyhumic moderate \nalkalinity very shallow lakes and it seems likely that these lakes are more likely to be limited \nby nitrogen rather than phosphorus.  We also conclude from our data that there is no \nsignificant effect of geographic region on our regression models, despite the relatively wide \narea from which our data were drawn.  A similar conclusion was reached by Seip et al. \n(2000), who concluded that trophic level, mediated via the TN:TP ratio is more important in \ninfluencing the Chl = f(TP) relationship than geographic region.  \n \nUse for Lake Management \n \nRegression models relating TP and TN to Chl are useful tools for lake managers as they \nenable management decisions to be made.  For example, standards for nutrients can be \nestablished and actions taken within the catchment to achieve them.  This is particularly \nimportant in the context of the Water Framework Directive where nutrient conditions capable \n 16\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nof supporting good ecological status need to be defined.  However, it is important to recognise \nthe limitations of such models and consider the most appropriate way to use them. \n \nFirstly, a linear model is only an approximation to what is more likely a curvilinear or \nsigmoidal relationship.  The effects of this can be minimised by using type-specific regression \nrelationships and restricting the regression to the linear regions of the response.  In most cases \nChl = f(TP) provided the best model, but where TN:TP ratios are low (\u226410) Chl = f(TN) may \nbe more reliable. \n \nSecondly, it is important to be aware of the relative high degree of scatter hidden in log log \nrelationships.  Many factors can influence this as we have discussed above and lake managers \nneed to know how to deal with this uncertainty.  For example, they may often need to assess \npermissible levels of nutrients necessary to prevent deterioration in ecological quality.  A \ntypical situation is the need to establish a target TP which would maintain a currently \nacceptable Chl concentration.  By using an appropriate type specific regression equation it \nwould be possible to determine a TP concentration that would correspond to the desired Chl.  \nHowever, there is significant uncertainty associated with this decision.  It should be noted that \nPrairie (1996) cautions that regressions with R2 < 0.65 should not be used for predictions, as \nthey have limited predictive power.  Our combined lake model has an R2 which exceeds this \nvalue, but has the disadvantage that it does not distinguish the significantly different \nresponses that lakes of different types have.  Although some of our type-specific models have \nR2 values >0.65 we suggest that it is more appropriate to use the models derived from \ngrouped lake types where the effect of type on the regression equations within the group was \nnot significant.  Two of these models have R2 values >0.65, but the high alkalinity lake model \nshould be used with more caution. \n 17\nREBECCA MS no.03 \n \nWhile a prediction from a regression model provides the most likely outcome, for any \nparticular lake, the outcome is uncertain with a chance that 50% of cases would yield higher \nor lower Chl concentrations than that predicted.  In situations where it is important to reduce \nthe risk of exceeding a given level of Chl, a target TP value could be determined using the \nupper confidence limit of the regression (e.g. 90th percent confidence of individual points).  If \nTP targets were based on this relationship then on average only 10% of sites might exceed the \ndesired Chl concentration, a more precautionary approach.  In contrast, faced with setting a \nrestoration target and justifying significant financial expenditure this might be interpreted as a \ntoo precautionary value.   In this case, the regression line might be a more appropriate choice, \nas 50% of lakes are likely to achieve the desired Chl at the TP value predicted. To assist in \nthis application to management, we provide figures containing both regression lines and \nconfidence limits for our three type specific models on a linear scale in appendix 1, together \nwith equations to predict both the regression line and values similar to the 90% confidence \nintervals based on the 5th and 95th percentiles of the residuals of the regression (appendix 2). \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn conclusion we propose that chlorophyll nutrient regression models can provide useful tools \nfor lake management, provided the uncertainty associated with them is clearly recognised.  \nTotal phosphorus and total nitrogen can be used to predict chlorophyll a concentration, \nalthough phosphorus is the better predictor for all types, with the exception of humic lakes.    \n \n 18\nREBECCA MS no.03 \nWe show that except for deep lakes, the widely used OECD models predict much lower \nconcentrations of chlorophyll than what is predicted with our regressions, which are based on \na large European data set.  We thus present 3 models for a) deep lakes, b) low and moderate \nalkalinity shallow and very shallow lakes and c) high alkalinity shallow and very shallow \nlakes, which we suggest are the most appropriate for lake management in Europe, where more \ndetailed regional models are not available. \n \n \nReferences \n \nCanfield D.
